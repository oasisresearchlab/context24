However , the dynamin mecha - nism is still debated because constriction is neces - sary but not sufﬁcient for ﬁssion . Here , we show that ﬁssion occurs at the interface between the dyna - min coat and the uncoated membrane . At this loca - tion , the considerable change in membrane curva - ture increases the local membrane elastic energy , reducing the energy barrier for ﬁssion . Fission kinetics depends on tension , bending rigidity , and the dynamin constriction torque . Indeed , we experi - mentally ﬁnd that the ﬁssion rate depends on membrane tension in vitro and during endocytosis in vivo . By estimating the energy barrier from the increased elastic energy at the edge of dynamin and measuring the dynamin torque , we show that the mechanical energy spent on dynamin constric - tion can reduce the energy barrier for ﬁssion sufﬁ - ciently to promote spontaneous ﬁssion . INTRODUCTION Membrane ﬁssion is an essential step in membrane trafﬁc , as it separates membrane cargoes from donor compartments . It is the inverse reaction to fusion . In many of the various fusion events in cells , a single type of machinery , the SNAREs , mediate the collapse of membranes . The general principle of the SNAREs mechanism is that the energy spent in the assembly of the SNARE complex overcomes the energy barrier to fusion by generating a hemifusion intermediate , also called the ‘‘stalk intermediate’’ ( Kozlovsky and Kozlov , 2002 ) . The stalk interme - diate is a structure where the cytosolic leaﬂets of the two mem - brane compartments are fused into one , whereas the lumenal leaﬂets are still separated . In the case of ﬁssion , different machineries mediate the separation of two compartments de - pending on the cellular context : dynamin during endocytosis ; endosomal sorting complex in retrograde transport - III ( ESCRT - III ) in multivesicular body biogenesis , cytokinesis , and viral budding ( Hurley and Hanson , 2010 ) . Small GTPases ( Sar1 , Arf1 ) involved in the initiation of the coat proteins ( COPs ) - depen - dent Golgi trafﬁcking have also been recently implicated in the ﬁssion reaction of the COPs ( Fromme et al . , 2007 ) . However , in all these ﬁssion reactions , it is not known whether the different machineries mediate ﬁssion on the basis on the same principle , mostly because physical understanding of how ﬁssion is medi - ated is lacking . By analogy to fusion , it has been , however , sug - gested that they operate through a similar stalk intermediate ( Kozlovsky and Kozlov , 2003 ) . Here , we focused on the physics of membrane ﬁssion , taking the dynamin system as a model in which the biochemistry is arguably better characterized than in other systems . Dynamin has been biochemically and genetically implicated in ﬁssion of endocytic vesicles ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ) . It is a GTPase that polymerizes into helical collars at the neck of cla - thrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) . The helical structure of dynamin imme - diately suggested that ﬁssion could be driven by a constriction of the helix . When assembled in absence of guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) , the nonconstricted dynamin helix surrounds a membrane tube with a radius , R u , of 10 nm ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Danino et al . , 2004 ) . Upon GTP hydrolysis , a conformational change of dy - namin at the dimer and the polymer levels ( Chappie et al . , 2011 ; Faelber et al . , 2011 ; Ford et al . , 2011 ) constricts the membrane ( Danino et al . , 2004 ; Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ) . Constriction correlates with a reduction of the helix radius , itself reﬂected by a reduction of the number of dimers per helix turn from 14 to 13 ( Chappie et al . , 2011 ) and torsion . This torsion of the entire helical polymer can be monitored by live imaging ( Roux et al . , 2006 ) . Early models ( Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ; Takei et al . , 1995 ) proposed that constriction was sufﬁcient to break the neck , as constriction would proceed until ﬁssion is fully Cell 151 , 619 – 629 , October 26 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 619 completed . More recent data have modiﬁed our understand - ing of the possible role of constriction in dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion : ( 1 ) dynamin cryoelectron microscopy images and 3D reconstruction showed that the polymer can constrict down to a constriction radius , R c , of 4 – 5 nm ( Danino et al . , 2004 ) , ﬁlled with a tubular membrane ( 2 nm thick ) that surrounds a water lumen ( 2 – 3 nm ) ( Chappie et al . , 2011 ) . These structural data support the idea that dynamin does not reach the hemiﬁs - sion state by constriction . ( 2 ) GTP - mediated constriction ( Danino et al . , 2004 ) and torsion ( Roux et al . , 2006 ) do not lead to ﬁssion unless the tube is both attached to the substrate ( Danino et al . , 2004 ) and subjected to longitudinal tension ( Roux et al . , 2006 ) . These results showed that membrane constriction is not sufﬁ - cient for ﬁssion and also suggested that mechanical parameters of the membrane ( tension , bending rigidity ) could play role in controlling ﬁssion . Theory of membrane mechanics links the elastic energy , E el , of the membrane to its shape via the Canham - Helfrich equation ( Helfrich , 1973 ) : E el = s D A + Z A k 2 J 2 dA : The ﬁrst term of this equation ( sD A ) is the energy associated with membrane stretching , which depends on the membrane tension , s , and the change in its surface area , D A . The second term is the energetic cost associated with membrane bending , a function of the local curvature , J ( which characterizes the local shape of the membrane ) , multiplied by the membrane bending rigidity , k , integrated over the whole membrane area , A . This rigidity depends on the lipid composition of the membrane . The Canham - Helfrich equation allows for calculating shapes and energies of lipid membranes in practically any conditions by measuring both membrane tension and rigidity . As the dynamin helix constricts , it imposes a strong curvature on the membrane tube that it covers . This strong curvature has a high energetic cost . We thus reasoned that dynamin constric - tion could be signiﬁcantly impeded by membrane elasticity , leading us to study how membrane mechanics inﬂuences the dy - namin - mediated ﬁssion reaction . In this study , we show that membrane ﬁssion is occurring at the frontier between the constricted dynamin coat and the bare membrane , a place where the important change in mem - brane curvature increases locally the elastic energy of the membrane . We further show that the energy barrier to ﬁssion is reduced by this local increase of membrane elastic energy , making ﬁssion spontaneously occur at the edge of dynamin . By setting rigidity ( 16 k B T ) and tension ( from 10 ! 5 to 5 . 10 ! 4 N / m ) and calculating the elastic energy difference between the unconstricted state ( 10 nm radius ) of dynamin and the hemiﬁs - sion intermediate ( 3 nm radius ) , we estimate the energy barrier to ﬁssion to be of the order of 30 – 60 k B T . By measuring the constriction strength , the torque of dynamin , we show that it is in the order of 700 – 1 , 000 pN nm , about 10 times larger than tor - ques measured for other proteins . The huge value of the torque is , however , required to constrict the membrane to such extent . Moreover , we show that the mechanical energy spent by dyna - min in constriction is sufﬁcient to reduce the energy barrier to ﬁssion by the same amount evaluated from the elastic energy of the membrane . Our results support a mechanism by which dynamin constricts fast , within a few hundreds of milliseconds , forcing the membrane to reach a high elastic energy state at the edge of the dynamin coat . The increased elastic energy of the membrane then triggers spontaneous ﬁssion at the edge of dynamin , which takes a few seconds . RESULTS Fission Occurs at the Edge of the Dynamin Coat We adapted an in vitro assay ( see Figure 1A ) developed for the study of curvature - dependent lipid sorting ( Sorre et al . , 2009 ) and protein binding ( Roux et al . , 2010 ; Sorre et al . , 2012 ) . The assay is based on the generation of a membrane nanotube pulled out of a giant unilamellar vesicle ( GUV ) by means of optical tweezers . The membrane tension , s , was set through aspiration of the GUV in a micropipette , allowing control over the dynamin - free tube radius , r = ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k = 2 s p . Using a second micropipette , we in - jected a mix of ﬂuorescent Alexa - 488 dynamin 1 / nonﬂuorescent dynamin 1 in the vicinity of these nanotubes ( see Experimental Procedures ) . In the absence of GTP , nucleation of dynamin seeds onto the nanotube , but no ﬁssion , was observed ( Roux et al . , 2010 ; data not shown ) . When GTP was added along with dynamin , small dynamin seeds formed along the tube , and membrane ﬁssion subsequently occurred ( see Figure 1B ; Movie S1 available online ) . As previously described ( Roux et al . , 2006 ) , the tube retracted rapidly following the ﬁrst break , and no further break was observed . Using fast dual - color confocal imaging ( see Extended Experimental Procedures ) , we observed that ﬁssion occurred at the edge of dynamin domain in 90 % ( N = 10 ) of the events ( see Figures 1C and S1 ; Movie S2 ) . Indeed , after ﬁssion , one extremity of the broken tube was covered with dyna - min , whereas the other one was not ( Figures 1C and S1 ; Movie S2 ) . No ﬁssion was observed in the uncoated regions of the tube . We hypothesized that the considerable change of curvature from the highly constricted dynamin - coated part to the less curved bare tube could favor ﬁssion . We were thus prompted to look at the efﬁciency of ﬁssion at the connection between the tube and the GUV , where the change in curvature is even more dramatic . Indeed , most of the ﬁssion events occurred at the boundary between the tube and the GUV ( 38 % ) or at the boundary between the tube and the bead ( 36 % ) ( N = 44 ; Figures 1D and 1E ; Movie S3 ) . It is worth noting that shapes of the membrane at both connections are similar , as the membrane - bead adhesion patch is much larger ( several hundreds of nano - meters ) than the size of the tube in this assay ( Koster et al . , 2005 ) . Dynamin nucleation was homogeneous along the tube axis ( Figure 1D , blue curve ) , indicating that this higher probability of ﬁssion was not due to preferential nucleation of dynamin at the bead , at the GUV , or on the parts of the nanotube adjacent to them but consistent with an inﬂuence of the local membrane shape ( Figure 1F ) . The Membrane Shape at the Dynamin - Membrane Edge Facilitates Fission We then calculated the shape of the membrane at the edge of the constricted dynamin tube ( hereinafter called the 620 Cell 151 , 619 – 629 , October 26 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . ‘‘dynamin - membrane edge’’ ) . By setting the constriction radius R c , s , and k ( see Extended Experimental Procedures ) and numerically minimizing the elastic energy of the membrane , we can calculate the shape of the dynamin - membrane edge ( Fig - ures 1F and 1G ) . The funnel shape of the dynamin - membrane edge is associated with a local increase in elastic energy that can be estimated numerically ( Figure 2B ) ( Shlomovitz et al . , 2011 ) . This elastic energy depends on the ratio a = R m / R c , where Figure 1 . Localization of Fission Events at Dynamin - Membrane Edges ( A ) Schematic drawing of the experimental set - up .

( F ) Fluorescence image of a membrane tube constricted by dynamin in presence of GTP ( TMR - PE ) . Scale bars , 5 m m . ( G ) Calculated shape a single dynamin - membrane edge by simulations . R m is the radius of the bare tube , which is set by membrane tension and bend - ing rigidity . Thus , the smaller R c is ( the more dynamin constricts ) , the higher the elastic energy of the dynamin - membrane edge is . We reasoned that the local increase of elastic energy of the membrane edge could favor ﬁssion by reducing its energy barrier . Fission was proposed to occur wherever the membrane reaches a hemi - ﬁssion state , when the membrane radius shrinks below a threshold R i " 3 nm ( Ko - zlovsky and Kozlov , 2003 ) , comparable to the membrane thick - ness ( see ﬁssion intermediate in Figure 2A ) . The existence of such hemiﬁssion intermediate is supported by the experimental fact that ﬁssion is nonleaky ( Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ) . Reaching an intermediate state with such a strongly curved membrane is a rare event and must thus be the rate - limiting step of membrane Cell 151 , 619 – 629 , October 26 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 621 ﬁssion . We propose that , by constriction of dynamin , the elastic energy of the membrane increases most at the edge of the dyna - min coat , thereby reaching the constricted state ( Figure 2A ) . Then thermal ﬂuctuations of the membrane edge would allow spontaneous fusion of the inner layer of the tube , reaching the hemiﬁssion state . Since the energy of the intermediate state E i and of the unconstricted state E u corresponds to the elastic energy of the membrane at the edge of dynamin , the full energy barrier is D E tot = E i ! E u ( see Figure 2A ) . We numerically estimated the magnitude of the energy barrier D E tot in two cases : ( 1 ) for the membrane edge connected to the bead or GUV ; and ( 2 ) for the membrane edge connected to the bare tube . For ( 1 ) , D E tot = 20 – 65 k B T , and for ( 2 ) , 35 – 70 k B T ( Fig - ure 2C ; k B T is the thermal energy ) . These values are close to previous theoretical estimations for the ﬁssion energy barrier ( Kozlovsky and Kozlov , 2003 ) . The actual value of the barrier depends on membrane tension ( see Figure 2C ) and rigidity ( data not shown ) . Also , as shown in Figure 2C , we predict that the energy barrier is smaller close to the bead or vesicle , thus accounting for a higher ﬁssion probability there ( Figure 1D ) . We further estimated the probability to break close to the bead or GUV from the difference of these energy barriers ( see Extended Experimental Procedures ) . Considering the range of tensions we have in our experiments ( 10 ! 6 N / m – 10 ! 4 N / m ) , we found this Figure 2 .

( C ) Total energy barrier for ﬁssion within the lipid tube ( blue ) or in the GUV - dynamin or bead - dyna - min edge ( green ) as a function of tension for k = 16 k B T and R i = 3nm , R u = 10 nm . probability to be between 70 % and 95 % , consistent with the above experi - mental value of 38 + 36 = 74 % . To further test the role of membrane elasticity in dynamin - mediated ﬁssion , we used our model to estimate the ex - pected dependence of the average ﬁssion time , < t f > , with membrane tension and bending rigidity . According to the model ( see Figure 2A ) , after constriction , ﬁssion at the dynamin - membrane edge is spontaneous and the residual energy barrier after constriction , D E res = E i ! E c is , this way , small enough to be over - come by thermal ﬂuctuations of the membrane ( see Figure 2A ) . If after constriction , ﬁssion is ther - mally activated , < t f > , should satisfy a simple Arrhenius equation , < t f > = t e D E res = k B T , where t " 1 ns is the typical time scale of the membrane tube thermal ﬂuctuations . By taking a linear approx - imation for the elastic energy of the edge with the curvature of the constricted dynamin tube ( 1 / R c ) , we ﬁnd ( see Extended Experi - mental Procedures ) : " t f # z t exp $ b k 3 = 2 ﬃﬃﬃ s p % k B T & ; ( Equation 1 ) where b is a constant that depends on R i and R c ; s , membrane tension ; and k , membrane rigidity . We experimentally validated Equation 1 by studying how long it takes for dynamin to break membrane tubes . As dynamin and GTP are coinjected , we deﬁned the ﬁssion time t f as the time elapsed between nucleation of dynamin seeds and ﬁssion ( see kymograph in Figure 3A ) . At 150 m M GTP , a physiological concentration of GTP ( Otero , 1990 ) , the average ﬁssion time < t f > was 9 . 6 ± 1 . 7 s , similar to the in vivo values ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . The ﬁssion time decreased when the GTP concentration increases , with < t f > at 1 m M GTP = 85 . 3 ± 8 . 7 s and < t f > at 10 mM GTP = 6 . 2 ± 0 . 8 s ( see Table S1 ) . As a ﬁrst test of our model , we veriﬁed that the ﬁssion times were exponentially distributed ( Figure 3B ; Table S1 ) as expected for a thermally 622 Cell 151 , 619 – 629 , October 26 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . activated , single - step process obeying Poisson statistics . We then veriﬁed that the dynamin - mediated ﬁssion reaction pro - ceeds through a hemiﬁssion intermediate . Lysolipids , such as lysophosphatidylcholine ( LPC ) , are known to inhibit fusion because their conical shape increases the hydrophobic mis - match in the stalk intermediate , increasing the energy barrier to fusion ( Chernomordik and Kozlov , 2008 ) . We found that 30 % mol / mol LPC increased the average ﬁssion time to 48 . 8 ± 16 s , with 10 % of the tubes not breaking after 300 s ( see Figure S2 ) . These results strongly support our assumption that dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion proceeds through a hemiﬁssion in - termediate , similar to the stalk / hemifusion intermediate in fusion . We next tested the dependence of the ﬁssion time with mem - brane tension and rigidity ( see Equation 1 ) . In our in vitro assay , membrane tension can be tuned by changing the aspiration pressure in the micropipette , and rigidity can be tuned by changing the lipid composition ( see Table S2 ; Extended Experi - Figure 3 .

As expected , the ﬁssion time increased with membrane rigidity ( Figure 3C ) , following exp ð constant 3 k 3 = 2 Þ ( see Equation 1 ) . Depen - dence of the ﬁssion time with membrane tension compatible with the predicted relation in exp ð constant = ﬃﬃﬃ s p Þ was also observed ( Figure 3D ) . The observed dependences of the ﬁssion time with tension and rigidity are in good agree - ment with our model , but our model also states that they should be the dominant membrane parameters controlling the ﬁssion time . Following this statement , we expected the logarithm of < t f > to have a linear dependence with k 3 = 2 = ﬃﬃﬃ s p ( see Equation 1 ) , which was experimentally veriﬁed ( Figure 3E ) . We concluded that the dependences of the ﬁssion time with membrane tension and rigidity further show that the mechanical determinants of the membrane shape control the kinetics of the dynamin ﬁssion reaction . The Dynamin Torque Is Sufﬁcient for Constriction The mechanism proposed earlier for dynamin - mediated ﬁs - sion reaction is strongly dependent on the ability of dynamin to constrict . We thus wondered if the constriction strength of dyna - min was sufﬁcient to constrict such membrane necks . As dyna - min undergoes torsion during constriction , it generates a torque ( see Figures 4A and S3C ; Movie S4 ) . Thus , the constriction Cell 151 , 619 – 629 , October 26 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 623 torque of dynamin must be strong enough to counteract membrane elasticity that widens the tube . In order to verify this , we measured the torque , G , exerted by dynamin during constriction by monitoring the position of beads of radius , r , attached to the dynamin coat . The beads rotated following GTP addition , allowing us to track the torsion of the dynamin coat ( Morlot et al . , 2010 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) . Because of this fast motion , the beads incurred a viscous drag , which counter - acted the torque generated by dynamin and limited the maximal angular speed . The viscous drag acting on a bead of radius r spinning around a linear axis is : G visc = 14 ph r 3 u , where u is the angular velocity of the bead and h is the viscosity of water . We used beads of 675 nm radius and measured an average angular speed of u = 15 . 8 ± 5 rad / s at 2 mM GTP ( Figure 4B ) , corre - sponding to an average torque of 214 ± 74 pN . nm . These beads are signiﬁcantly slower than beads of 95 – 180 nm radii used in previous studies ( " 55 rad / s ) ( see Morlot et al . , 2010 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) indicating that the viscous torque acting on the 675 nm beads is of the same order of the dynamin torque . Because the beads are rotating , the torque of dynamin is larger than the measured viscous torque . The highest value of the viscous torque ( 730 pN . nm ; see Figure 4C ) obtained for the fast - est bead is thus a closer underestimate of the dynamin torque . G = 730 pN . nm is 20 times larger than the torque developed by proteins twisting DNA ( 10 – 20 pN . nm for the recombinase RecA ) ( Lipfert et al . , 2010 ) or the rotational motor F1 ATPase , which usually generate torques of 40 pN . nm ( Yasuda et al . , 1998 ) . We measured the maximum torque of dynamin ( stall torque G s ) by attaching magnetic beads to dynamin - coated tubules and blocking their rotation with a magnetic ﬁeld . After calibration of the set - up ( see Extended Experimental Procedures and Figures S3A , S3B , S3D , and S3E ) , magnetic ﬁelds were translated into the magnetic torque experienced by the bead in the magnetic ﬁeld . We found that beads stopped to rotate when magnetic tor - quesexceeded1 , 300pN . nmat1mMGTP . Rotationalmovement started again upon switching off the magnetic ﬁeld ( Figure S3F ; Movie S5 ) , conﬁrming that abrupt stop was dueto magnetic ﬁeld . We observed that the angular velocity of the bead decreased linearly with increasing intensities of the magnetic ﬁeld ( Figures 4D and 4E ) . Linear ﬁts ( Figure 4E ) gave an average value of the stall torque of dynamin of 1 , 100 ± 340 pN . nm . Figure 4 .

From the free energy of a dynamin - constricted tube ( see Extended Experimental Procedures ) , we calculated that R c is related to the dynamin torque by R c = R u = ð 1 + ð G R u = 2 pk h ÞÞ , where h = 13 nm is the dynamin pitch . According to this relation , constriction from R u = 10 nm to R c = 5 nm radius would require a torque of approximately 500 pN . nm . We concluded that the large value of the dynamin torque measured earlier was necessary and sufﬁcient for constriction of membrane necks . Dynamin Mechanical Work Reduces the Energy Barrier to Fission The mechanical work of dynamin is partially spent in reducing the energy barrier to ﬁssion . If our model is valid , this fraction of the mechanical work reduces signiﬁcantly the energy barrier . The residual barrier D E res should be in the range of a few k B T . Thus , we expect the dynamin work to be of the same order of magnitude as the full barrier D E tot estimated from the elastic energy of the membrane ( discussed earlier ) . Theoretically , the fraction of the dynamin work can be subtracted from the energy barrier ( see Extended Experimental Procedures ) , with D E res = D E tot ! c G q , where Gq is the dynamin work ( Figure S3C ; also dis - cussed later ) . The ﬁssion time expression is then : h t f i z t exp ð D E tot ! c G q = k B T Þ ; ( Equation 2 ) where c is a constant and q is the angle by which the helix rotates for each GTP it hydrolyzes ( Figure S3C ) . According to this deﬁni - tion , we can identify Gq as the work performed by the helix per hydrolyzed GTP . According to Equation 2 , for each amount Gq of mechanical work performed per GTP , D E tot is lowered by an amount c Gq . Thus , c characterizes the efﬁciency with which mechanical work is used to lower the ﬁssion barrier . The work performed by dynamin upon the hydrolysis of one GTP is propor - tional to the difference in chemical potential between GTP and its hydrolysis products . Thus , for experimental concentrations of GTP , we expect : Gq = x k B T ln ð½ GTP & Þ + constant ; ( Equation 3 ) where the dimensionless number x is the yield of the conversion of chemical energy into work . As a consequence , the product c x characterizes the efﬁciency with which dynamin uses chemical energy to lower the barrier to ﬁssion . Inserting Equation 3 into Equation 2 , we ﬁnally ﬁnd : ln ð < t f > Þ = c x ln ð½ GTP & Þ + constant : ( Equation 4 ) To validate this extended mechanochemical framework ex - perimentally , we sought to verify the predicted GTP depen - dences and to characterize the efﬁciency c x . We ﬁrst showed ( Figure 4B ) that the torque G depended linearly on ln ð½ GTP & Þ , as expected from Equation 3 . The slope allowed us to estimate x / q = 34 . Knowing the full constriction angle q full from structural data ( Mears et al . , 2007 ; 1 / 14 of a turn leads to q full = 2 p = 14 z 0 : 45 rad ) , and assuming that x = 1 , we could calculate the minimal number of hydrolyzed GTPs to reach full constriction N = q full = q = 34 3 0 : 45 z 15 . We then measured the dependence of the ﬁssion time on GTP concentration , yielding very good agreement with Equation 4 ( Figure 4F ) for values of GTP con - centration lower than 10 mM . The experimental veriﬁcation of Equation 4 validates our picture of the role of GTP hydrolysis in lowering the energy barrier to ﬁssion through a modiﬁcation of the membrane shape . It is interesting that the slope of this curve gave c x = 0 . 37 ± 0 . 07 , meaning that over a large range of GTP concentrations , the reduction of the ﬁssion energy barrier represents 37 % of the energy available from GTP hydrolysis . Knowing the minimal number N of GTP required for a full con - striction of dynamin , we estimated the minimal energy E min spent by dynamin in reducing the energy barrier to ﬁssion : One GTP delivers " 20 k B T ; thus , E min = Fractionof chemical energy 3 N 3 Energy of hydrolysis of one GTP = 37 % 3 15 3 20 k B T z 111 k B T . This value is of the same order of magnitude as the energy barrier D E tot values ( 35 – 70 k B T ) estimated from the change in shape of the dynamin - membrane edge mediated by dynamin constric - tion . This simple calculation shows that dynamin through its constriction transfers enough energy to the membrane to signif - icantly reduce the energy barrier to ﬁssion so that it becomes spontaneous at the dynamin - membrane edge . Dynamin Reaction Kinetics Is Controlled by Membrane Tension In Vivo We next studied if the shape of the dynamin - membrane edge could control the kinetics of dynamin ﬁssion in vivo . We aimed at reducing membrane tension and tracked the effect on the dynamics of CCP formation . We exchanged quickly the culture medium of Cos7 cells to medium containing 0 . 45 M sucrose ( Heuser and Anderson , 1989 ) and followed the dynamics of cla - thrin - GFP by confocal imaging . As previously described ( Heuser and Anderson , 1989 ) , the rapid turnover of clathrin - GFP dots at the plasma membrane in Cos7 cells stopped within seconds after the shock ( Figure 5A ; Movie S6 ) . The number of clathrin - GFP dots increased after the shock . These clathrin - GFP struc - tures seemed to stay attached to the plasma membrane , sug - gesting a block of the clathrin - coated pits at the ﬁssion level . Consistently , dynamin - GFP followed the same behavior : More dots were seen after the shock ( Figure 5B ; Movie S6 ) , without turnover ( see kymograph in Figure 5B ) . Moreover , the clathrin - RFP structures perfectly colocalized with dynamin - GFP dots after the shock ( " 85 % ; see Figure 5C ) , showing that clathrin structures were blocked at the stage of dynamin ring formation . As the dynamics of clathrin bud are altered by overexpression of endocytic proteins , we tested the effect of hypertonic shock on genome - edited SKML - 2 cells , where clathrin - RFP and dyna - min - GFP are expressed at the same level as that of endogenous proteins ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ) . When hypertonic medium was applied to these cells , the number of clathrin / dynamin dots increased , and their dynamic exchange was blocked ( data not shown ) . As in Cos7 cells , clathrin - RFP dots colocalized with dy - namin - GFP dots ( see Figure S4 ) . We next veriﬁed that the clathrin dots blocked at the ﬁssion step were fully assembled CCPs . They indeed partially colocal - ized with transferrin , showing that cargo were present in these structures ( see Figure 5D ) . As well , the plasma membrane lipophilic dye MASK ( Invitrogen ) showed a slightly increased signal in clathrin structures , reﬂecting the curved membrane of Cell 151 , 619 – 629 , October 26 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 625 the bud ( see Figure 5E ) . Taken together , these results strongly support the idea that many of the clathrin - coated dots frozen at the plasma membrane are fully assembled CCPs , blocked at the assembled dynamin stage , unable to break the mem - brane . These in vivo results are consistent with our in vitro results : They show that a membrane tension decrease blocks dynamin - dependent endocytosis at the ﬁssion step , in a similar way than reduced membrane tension strongly delayed ﬁssion in vitro . Moreover , as previously reported ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) , we ﬁnd that hypo - osmotic shock delays CCPs formation but Figure 5 .

DISCUSSION In this study , we ﬁrst showed that dynamin - mediated ﬁssion occurs at the edge of the dynamin coat . Consistently , in mito - chondrial ﬁssion , breakage was often observed at the boundary between the DNM1 ring and the rest of the mitochondria ( Blea - zard et al . , 1999 ) . We then showed that ﬁssion was facilitated at the dynamin - membrane edge because of the local membrane elastic energy increase due to considerable change in curvature . We next showed that not only the location but also the kinetics of the reaction is set by the shape of the membrane connecting the constricted tube to the bare part of the membrane . The constric - tion torque of dynamin and membrane elasticity parameters such as tension and bending rigidity that control the membrane edge shape thus act directly on the kinetics of dynamin - medi - ated membrane ﬁssion . Moreover , we showed in this study that the calculation of the energy barrier estimated from the shape of the membrane ( from which we can estimate the elastic energy of the membrane ) is in the range of 50 – 70 k B T and can be overcome by the mechanical work generated by dynamin during constriction ( in the range of 100 k B T ) . It is important to note that the contributions of the dynamin work , tension and rigidity to the kinetics of the ﬁssion reaction are different : Measured GTPase rate of dynamin in the assembled form ( Praefcke and McMahon , 2004 ) suggests that the minimal amount of GTP required for full constriction is hydrolyzed within hundreds of milliseconds . Our previous study of the dynamics of dynamin constriction ( Morlot et al . , 2010 ) consistently showed that constriction should also happen within a few hundreds of milliseconds . As for nonlimiting GTP concentrations , ﬁssion takes a few seconds at least ; our resultsarecompatiblewith , ﬁrst , ( 1 ) afastconstrictionofdynamin , andthen ( 2 ) a long delay to spontaneousﬁssion of theconstricted neck . Thus , at nonlimiting GTP concentrations ( closer to in vivo situation ) , the kinetics of dynamin - membrane ﬁssion are ex - pectedtobeprimarilyregulatedbytheelasticityofthemembrane . Indeed , we showed that , consistently with our in vitro results , clathrin - mediated endocytosis is blocked by reducing mem - brane tension in vivo . Also , in vivo ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) and invitro ( this studyand Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ) , typical ﬁssion times ( a few seconds ) are similar , with membrane tension values aver - aging 10 ! 4 N / m , ( for in vivo values , see Dai et al . , 1997 ) . Our ﬁndingthatreducedmembranetensiondelaysmembraneﬁssion is qualitatively similar to previous results showing the need of longitudinal tension for dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion ( Roux et al . , 2006 ) . Consistently , when membrane tension is arti - ﬁcially kept low by using an excess of membrane reservoir , dyna - min - mediated membrane ﬁssion takes several tens of seconds , close to a minute ( Pucadyil and Schmid , 2008 ) . Finally , we showed that increased membrane rigidity delays ﬁssion , which is consistent with previous ﬁndings where increased membrane rigidity inhibited ﬁssion ( Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ) . These observa - tions strengthen the idea that ﬁssion kinetics is controlled by elasticity of the membrane in vivo . Recent studies ( Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ; Pucadyil and Schmid , 2008 ) have been undertaken to suggest that dynamin - mediated ﬁssion could be triggered by GTP - induced depolymerization instead of constriction . Our results showing that ﬁssion occurs at the edge of the dynamin coat indicate that it requires partial coating of the membrane , which can be achieved either by partial polymerization of a bare membrane , or partial depolymer - ization of a fully coated membrane . However , in our experiments , we never observed depolymerization of the dynamin coat before ( see Figure 3A ) or after ( see Figure 1C ; t = 2 . 5 s ) ﬁssion . Because in our experiments the optical resolution limit is above the size of a dynamin turn , we cannot exclude depolymerization restricted to a few turns . In the hypothesis that ﬁssion is mediated through depolymerization , it was predicted that long coats would have a reduced ﬁssion efﬁciency ( Pucadyil and Schmid , 2008 ) , as they would require more time to be fully depolymerized . In our experiments , we saw no dependence of the ﬁssion time with length of single dynamin seeds , from 150 nm to 10 m m ( see Fig - ure S1B ) . Also , GTP energy was proposed to be spent in depo - lymerization rather than constriction ( Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ) . The authors used conductance through dynamin - coated membrane tubes to measure their radii and found very small radii for assem - bled , nonconstricted dynamin ( between 2 and 3 nm , 5 – 7 nm with membrane ) when compared to the 10 – 11 nm radii found in other studies ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Danino et al . , 2004 ; Roux et al . , 2010 ) . When GTP was added , conductance increased before ﬁssion , suggesting disassembly . They concluded that GTP - induced depolymerization of dynamin could lead to spontaneous ﬁssion because of the narrow radius of assembled dynamin . This scenario becomes realistic for radii much below 10 nm , as tubules of 10 nm are stable . As the authors did not take into account the Debye length ( Roux and Antonny , 2008 ) , the screening distance of ionic charges ( in the order of 1 – 2 nm ) , the conductance values of radii may not be accurate , which would explain discrepancy with other techniques ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Danino et al . , 2004 ; Roux et al . , 2010 ; Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , most probably , assembled dyna - min makes tubules of 10 nm radius , which require further GTP - dependent constriction to be cut . In our present study , the good agreement between energetics of membrane constriction and dynamin torque work favors the hypothesis that GTP energy is primarily spent in constriction rather than in depolymerization . In a broader perspective , the model presented here to explain the mechanism of dynamin function might show the important role of membrane elasticity for all ﬁssion reactions mediated by the constriction of a narrow membrane neck , as it is proposed for ESCRT - III - mediated ﬁssion ( Fabrikant et al . , 2009 ) and as it is the case in lipid phase separation ( Roux et al . , 2005 ) . However , how constriction is performed and which energy source is used in other , dynamin - independent , ﬁssion reactions remains to be understood . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES A full description of the methods is in the Extended Experimental Procedures . Nanotube Pulling From GUV GUVs were made by a modiﬁed protocol of the electroformation technique ( Angelova et al . , 1992 ; Roux et al . , 2010 ) . The aspiration of a GUV of radius R GUV within a micropipette of radius R pipette allowed to set membrane tension : s = ð 1 = 2 Þð R pipette D P Þ = ð 1 ! ð R pipette = R GUV ÞÞ ( Evans and Rawicz , 1990 ) . Cell 151 , 619 – 629 , October 26 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 627 A lipid nanotube was extruded from a micropipette - aspirated GUV contain - ing 0 . 03 % mol / mol of a biotinylated lipid ( DSPE - PEG2000 - Biotin , Avanti Polar Lipids , Alabaster , AL , USA ) by moving away the pipette from an optically trap - ped , 3 m m diameter streptavidin - coated bead ( Spherotec , Lake Forest , IL , USA ) attached to the GUV prior to pulling . The ﬁxed optical trap was custom - made and calibrated ( see Extended Experimental Procedures ; stiff - ness , k = 360 pN . m m ! 1 $ W ! 1 ) . A mix of baculovirus puriﬁed human dynamin 1 ( see Extended Experimental Procedures for puriﬁcation details ) and GTP ( Roche Applied Science , Indianapolis , IN , USA ) was injected in the vicinity of the lipid tube via a second micropipette . Two - color time - lapse acquisitions were performed with either a confocal microscopy ( Eclipse C1 Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) or a spinning disk confocal ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations , Denver , CO , USA ) . Torque Measurement by Viscous Drag and Magnetic Field Streptavidinbeads ( 1 . 35 m mdiameterstreptavidin - coated , polystyrenebeads , Spherotec , Lake Forest , Illinois , USA ) are grafted onto biotinylated dynamin tubules formed from membrane sheets ( see Extended Experimental Proce - dures ) ( Morlot et al . , 2010 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) . The beads rotate following GTP addition and resulting constriction of the dynamin coat ( Morlot et al . , 2010 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) , experiencing a viscous torque G v = 14 ph ð R + r Þ 3 u = xu ( Happel and Brenner , 1983 ) , where h is the viscosity of the surrounding ﬂuid , R is the radius of the bead , r is the radius of the tubule , and u is the angular spinning velocity . Differential interference contrast ( DIC ) and computer - based live recording of the rotating beads with a GUPPY camera ( Allied Vision Technologies , Stadtroda , Germany ) allowed direct measure of the angular spinning velocity and estimation of the viscous torque from the aforementioned formula . Thestalltorque , G S , wasmeasuredbyusingmagneticbeads ( 1 . 31 m mdiam - eter streptavidin - coated , paramagnetic beads ; Spherotec , Lake Forest , IL , USA ) , to which is applied an external torque via a variable electromagnetic ﬁeld . Thismagnetic ﬁeld was calibrated by two independent methods detailed in the Extended Experimental Procedures . Cell Transfections , Plasma Membrane Staining , Transferrin Uptake , and Hypertonic Shock COS - 7 cells were transfected using FuGENE - 6 ( Roche Applied Science , Indi - anapolis , IN , USA ) with dynamin 2 fused to green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) ( kindly provided by P . De Camilli ; Howard Hughes Medical Institute [ HHMI ] , Yale University ) or mouse clathrin - light - chain fused to mCherry or GFP ( kindly provided by C . Merriﬁeld , Cambridge University , and by P . De Camilli , HHMI , Yale University ) . Cells were imaged 18 to 24 hr posttransfection in Leibovitz medium ( GIBCO , Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ) . While imaging , the medium was changed with a hypertonic solution of 0 . 25 M sucrose in Leibovitz medium . Cell membrane staining was achieved by incubating cells for 5 min at37 ’ CwithdeepredCellMask ( MolecularProbes , LifeTechnologies , Paisley , UK ) before imaging . For Transferrin uptake assays , cells were starved in serum - deprived Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium M - F12 for 30 min on ice , then incubated with 5 m g / ml Alexa - ﬂuor 594 Transferrin ( Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY , USA ) in hypertonic medium ( 0 . 25 M sucrose Leibovitz medium ) for 3 min at RT . Cells were washed with hypertonic buffer before imaging .

BodipyTMR - PIP 2 ( RedPIP 2 ) was purchased from Echelon Bioscience , Salt Lake City , Utah , USA , and Guanosine Triphosphate ( GTP ) from Roche Applied Science , Indianapolis , Indiana , USA . Five lipid preparations were used ( molar percentage ) : 80 % EPC + 19 % PIP 2 + 1 % RedPIP 2 ; 70 % EPC + 10 % BSM + 19 % PIP 2 + 1 % RedPIP 2 supplemented with 40 % cholesterol ; 80 % EPC + 19 % PIP 2 + 1 % RedPIP 2 supplemented with 50 % cholesterol ; 80 % BSM + 19 % PIP 2 + 1 % RedPIP 2 supplemented with 50 % cholesterol and 50 % EPC + 30 % Lyso PC + 19 % PIP 2 + 1 % RedPIP 2 . These ﬁve mixtures also contained 0 . 03 % DSPE - PEG2000 - Biotin . Protein Puriﬁcation Recombinant human dynamin 1 was puriﬁed from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus using the BD baculogold express - ing system ( BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ USA ) . Dynamin was puriﬁed from cell lysate with the GST - tagged SH3 domain of rat Amphiphysin 1 as an afﬁnity ligand as previously described ( Stowell et al . , 1999 ) . Brieﬂy , cells from twenty 150cm 2 ﬂasks were re - suspended in 20 ml of Buffer A ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 1 % Triton X - 100 ) supplemented with the protease inhibitor cocktail ( cOmplete ULTRA Tablets , Roche Applied Science , Indianapolis , Indiana , USA ) and homogenized with a 60 ml dounce . The lysate was centrifuged at 40krpm on a Ti70 rotor ( Beckman - Coulter , Brea , CA ) , and the supernatant was incubated for 2 hr with glutathione beads to which 3 - 5 mg of puriﬁed GST - SH3 domain of rat Amphiphysin 1 were attached . Next , the beads were batch - washed with 150 ml of Buffer A without Triton X - 100 . Elution was done with high salt ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 1 . 2 M NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) . Unlabeled dynamin was dialyzed against storage buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) , concentrated using Amicon ( 50kDa CO ) , aliquoted , ﬂash - frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at ! 80 " C . To ﬂuorescently label dynamin , we dialyzed dynamin against PBS 50 % glycerol . The labeling reaction was conducted using stan - dard procedures ( Alexa - 488 protein labeling kit from Invitrogen , cat # A - 10235 ) . In some case , dynamin 1 was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide ( Molecular Probes , Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ) . To attach streptavidin - coated microbeads to dynamin poly - mers , dynamin was conjugated to DSB - X Biotin C2 - iodoacetamide ( Molecular Probes , Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ) . Labeled dynamins were dialysed against storage buffer , aliquoted and kept at ! 80 " C . Nanotube Pulling from GUV Lipid mix ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) was deposited on indium - tin oxide coated glass slides and dried 1h at 55 " C to remove all solvents . GUVs were electroformed ( 1V , 10Hz ) ( Angelova et al . , 1992 ; Stowell et al . , 1999 ) for 1h at 55 " C in a 200 mM sucrose solution then transferred in an observation chamber pretreated with Casein solution ( 2 mg / ml ) . GUVs were aspirated in a micropipette controlled with a motorized micromanipulator ( MP - 225 , Sutter Instrument , Novato , California , USA ) and a custom - made hydraulic system to control aspiration pressure D P and to set the tension : s = 1 = 2 ð R pipette D P = ð 1 ! R pipette = R GUV ÞÞ where R pipette and R GUV are the radii of the pipette and the GUV respectively ( Evans and Rawicz , 1990 ) . A membrane nanotube was formed by pulling away a micropipette aspirated GUV whose membrane was attached to a streptavidin - coated bead ( 3 . 05 m m diameter , Spherotec , Lake Forest , Illinois , USA ) hold in a ﬁxed optical trap . The custom - made optical trap was made by focusing an ytterbium ﬁber laser ( IPG laser , Burbach , Germany ) through a 100X 1 . 3 NA oil immersion objective ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . The force F exerted on the bead was calculated from the Hooke’s law : F = k * D x where k is the stiffness of the trap ( k = 360pN . m m ! 1 . W ! 1 ) calibrated by viscous drag method ( Neuman and Block , 2004 ) and D x the displacement of the bead from its equilibrium position in the optical trap . Video - rate movies and displace - ment measurements were done via a C - MOS Camera ( Pixelink , Ottawa , Canada ) with a user - made video recorder and bead tracking software under Matlab . Dynamin and GTP were injected close to the nanotube with a second micropipette of typical 10 micron radius controlled with a hydraulic micromanipulator ( Narishige , Tokyo , Japan ) . Nanotubes were observed simultaneously by bright ﬁeld imaging and by dual - color confocal microscopy ( l 1 = 488 nm and l 2 = 543 nm ) on a Nikon eclipse Ti inverted microscope ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . For fast 2 - colors confocal experiments , a spinning disk ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations , Denver , CO ) and a two - channel simulta - neous - imaging system ( Dual - View , Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) were used instead of standard confocal microscopy ( Eclipse C1 Confocal , Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . Membrane Sheets and Dynamin Tubules Formation To form membrane sheets , 22x40 mm glass coverslips were ﬁrst cleaned by sonication ( 5 min ) in 1 % Decon 90 , Modec , USA , in distilled water . After thorough washing and sonication ( 5 min ) in distilled water to remove any trace of detergent , coverslips were ﬁnally washed with 100 % ethanol prior to storage in ethanol . Coverslip were dried under a N 2 ﬂux , and 1 m l droplets of lipid solution ( 10 mg / ml in pure chloroform ) were deposited and allowed to dry on the coverslip . Typically , two drops were deposited at different sites on a same coverslips . The use of pure chloroform was essential to allow lipid droplet drying in a way that was optimal for the subsequent formation of membrane sheets upon hydration . Coverslips were then dried again under vacuum ( 0 . 2 milli - torr ) for at least one hour , and kept up to several days under vacuum . Cell 151 , 619 – 629 , October 26 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . S1 Before use , coverslips were placed for 20 – 30 min in a wet incubator ( 37 " C , 100 % humidity ) to allow partial hydration of the lipids . Next , a small chamber ( approximately 15 m l volume ) was built by placing the coverslip onto a glass slide , with the lipids facing the glass slide , using a double - sided Scotch ( 3M ) tape as a spacer . The lipids were fully rehydrated by applying to the side of the chamber 15 – 20 m l of GTPase buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) containing 0 . 1 mg / ml casein ( C7078 , Sigma ) ( casein buffer ) which were taken up into the chamber by capillarity . Lipid deposits then transformed into membrane sheets . Dynamin solu - tion , typically 0 . 5 - 1 mg / ml was then added to the side of the chamber , and transferred into the chamber by capillarity . Membrane sheets were then deformed into dynamin - coated tubules visible by DIC ( Morlot et al . , 2010 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) . Torque Measurement by Viscous Drag Streptavidin beads ( 1 . 35 m m diameter streptavidin - coated , polystyrene beads , Spherotec , Lake Forest , IL ) were grafted onto bio - tinylated dynamin tubules formed from membrane sheets ( Morlot et al . , 2010 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) by adding them to the chamber after tubule growth . The beads rotate following GTP addition and resulting constriction of the dynamin coat ( Morlot et al . , 2010 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) , experiencing a viscous torque G v = 14 ph ð R + r Þ 3 u = xu ( Happel and Brenner , 1983 ) , where h is the viscosity of the surrounding ﬂuid , R the radius of the bead , r the radius of the tubule and u is the angular spinning velocity . Differential Interference Contrast ( DIC ) and computer - based live recording of the rotating beads with a GUPPY camera ( Allied Vision Technologies , Stadtroda , Germany ) allowed direct measure of the angular spinning velocity and estimation of the viscous torque from the formula above . Stall Torque Measurement by Magnetic Field To measure the stall torque G S that arrests the constriction of the membrane tube , we use a magnetic bead , to which an external torque via a variable magnetic ﬁeld . The observation chamber ( Figure S2A ) is placed on the stage of an Axiovert 100 microscope ( Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) equipped with a differential interference contrast ( DIC ) , a ﬂuorescence lamp and a UI - 2220SE charge - coupled - device ( CCD camera - IDS , Obersulm , Germany ) . The magnetic ﬁeld to manipulate the magnetic beads is generated by two homemade electromagnets ( see Figure S2B ) . Both the electromagnets are controlled using a NI USB - 6211 multifunction data acquisition card ( National Instruments , Austin , Texas , USA ) and a homemade power supply . Magnets are calibrated using a DC magnetometer ( AlphaLab , West Salt Lake City , UT ) . The bead motion is recorded and tracked using user - developed procedure under MATLAB . To calibrate the torque induced by the magnetic ﬁeld , the bead is attached to a dynamin - lipid nanotube and oriented with a magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the coverslip ( position ‘‘1’’ in the schema shown in Figure S2C , top ) . When the magnets polarity is switched , the bead rotates around the nanotube to follow the magnetic ﬁeld and goes from position ‘‘1’’ to position ‘‘2 . ’’ According to Langevin’s equation , the angular speed u ( q ) of the bead is proportional to the magnetic torque G ( q ) ε u ð q Þ = G ð q Þ + m ð t Þ = G max sin ð q Þ + m ð t Þ ; Where ε is the viscous drag of the bead , m ( t ) is a thermal noise and G max is the torque exerted when the magnetic moment of the bead is perpendicular to the ﬁeld ( q = p / 2 ) . As the thermal noise is negligible compared to the magnetic torque , the maximal angular speed u ( q = p / 2 ) = ε G max , where ε = 14 p h ( R + r ) 3 ( see above [ Happel and Brenner , 1983 ] ) . In our measurements h is the viscosity of the water ( 1 mPa $ s ) , R is the radius of the bead ( 655nm ) and r is the radius of the dynamin - coated tube ( 25 nm ) . For each bead G max is evaluated for different magnetic ﬁelds ( Figure S2C , bottom ) . Alternatively , the torque is calibrated with respect to the applied magnetic ﬁeld through the thermal ﬂuctuations of the beads . According to the equipartition theorem , the mean square amplitude of angular ﬂuctuations is : D w 2 = k B T k G ; where k B is the Boltzmann constant , T is the temperature and k G = ! v G = vw j G = 0 is the curvature of the magnetic potential around its minimum . The magnetic dipole moment is evaluated for different magnetic ﬁeld B to obtain the calibration curve G ( B , q ) . Cell Transfection , Treatment , and Imaging COS - 7 cells were transfected using FuGENE - 6 ( Roche Applied Science , Indianapolis , IN ) with dynamin 2 fused to Green Fluorescent Protein ( GFP ) ( kindly provided by P .

Cells were imaged 18 to 24 hr post transfection in Leibovitz medium ( GIBCO , Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ) . While imaging , the medium was changed with a hypertonic solution of 0 . 25 M sucrose in Leibovitz medium . Cell membrane staining was achieved by incubating cells for 5 0 at 37 " C with deep red Cell Mask ( Molecular Probes , Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ) before imaging .

Transferrin Labeling Cells were starved in serum deprived DMEM - F12 medium for 30 min on ice , then incubated with 5 m g / ml Alexa - ﬂuor 594 Transferrin ( Invitrogen ) in hypertonic medium ( 0 . 25 M sucrose Leibovitz medium ) for 3 0 at RT . Cells were washed with hypertonic buffer before imaging . S2 Cell 151 , 619 – 629 , October 26 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . Image Analysis Images were analyzed and processed with ImageJ . Kymographs were made with Multiple Kymograph plugin ( J . Rietdorf ; A . Seitz ) . Fits were made with the curve ﬁtting toolbox in Matlab . Membrane Shape Computation In this section we ﬁrst derive the equilibrium equation for the shape of the membrane from Canham - Helfrich Hamiltonian and express the shape computation as a boundary value problem suitable for solution with Matlab’s bvp4c . Canham - Helfrich Hamiltonian gives the energy of the membrane as a function of its shape : E = s Z dA + k 2 Z J 2 dA : The ﬁrst term is related to the energy cost of stretching the membrane and s is the membrane tension which can be controlled in the experiment . The second term represents the energy cost of bending which is given by the integral of membrane curvature J over the surface . The bending modulus k depends on the composition of the membrane . Considering the axial symmetry of the experiment we will restrict ourselves to axisymmetric shapes . For an axisymmetric surface with an axial coordinate z , and angle 4 around the z axis , and a radius r ð z Þ , curvature can be expressed as : J = r ð z Þ r 00 ð z Þ ! r 0 ð z Þ 2 ! 1 r ð z Þ ! 1 + r 0 ð z Þ 2 " 3 = 2 : Writing the area element in the same coordinates dA = r ð z Þ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ r 0 ð z Þ 2 + 1 q dzd 4 , the integral in the angle 4 can be directly performed and the energy can be cast in the following form : E = Z ! s + k 2 J 2 " r ð z Þ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ r 0 ð z Þ 2 + 1 q dzd 4 = 2 p Z $ s + k 2 J 2 " r ð z Þ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ r 0 ð z Þ 2 + 1 q dz : It will be convenient for numerical solution of the equations to nondimensionalize the Hamiltonian using the bare membrane radius R m = ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k = 2 s p to rescale all lengths , and pk to rescale the energy : e = Z % 1 + j 2 & r ð q Þ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ _ r ð q Þ 2 + 1 q d q = Z [ ð r ð q Þ ; _ r ð q Þ ; € r ð q ÞÞ d q ; where j = r ð q Þ € r ð q Þ ! _ r ð q Þ ! 1 r ð q Þ ! 1 + _ r ð q Þ 2 " 3 = 2 ; r ð q Þ = r ð z Þ R m ; q = z R m ; e = E pk ; [ = % 1 + j 2 & r ð q Þ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ _ r ð q Þ 2 + 1 q are all adimensional quantities and the dot represents differentiation with respect to q . At equilibrium , membrane shape minimizes the energy . Thus , the equilibrium shape is given by the solution of Euler - Lagrange equation d [ d q = d d q v [ v _ r ! d 2 d q 2 v [ v € r ; which is the nonlinear fourth order differential equation : ! ! 1 ! 6 _ r 2 ! 10 _ r 3 ! 9 _ r 4 ! 10 _ r 5 ! 4 _ r 6 + r € r % 3 + 30 _ r ! 9 _ r 2 ! 40 _ r 3 ! 12 _ r 4 & + r 2 % 1 + _ r 2 & % 1 + _ r 4 + _ r 6 + 3 € r 2 + _ r 2 % 3 ! 12 € r 2 & + 4 _ rr . + 4 _ r 3 r . & + _ r 3 ! 5 % ! 1 + 6 _ r 2 & € r 3 ! % 1 + _ r 2 & € r % 1 + 2 _ r 2 + _ r 4 + 20 _ rr . & + 2 % 1 + _ r 2 & 2 €€ r " " = 0 This equation was solved in the domain q ε ½ 0 ; 10 & , with two different sets of boundary conditions . For the junction between the tube and the dynamin - coated tube , it was required that r ð 0 Þ = 1 ; _ r ð 0 Þ = 0 r ð 10 Þ = r d ; _ r ð 10 Þ = 0 with r d = R d = R m the adimensional dynamin radius , which was varied to compute the energy at different levels of constriction . For the neck joining the vesicle or bead to the dynamin - coated tube , boundary conditions were r ð 0 Þ = 20 ; r ð 0 Þ € r ð 0 Þ ! _ r ð 0 Þ ! 1 = 0 Cell 151 , 619 – 629 , October 26 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . S3 r ð 10 Þ = r d ; _ r ð 10 Þ = 0 : The ﬁrst condition ensures membrane joins the ﬂat wall that mimics the vesicle at q = 0 with vanishing curvature . See the following parts of the Extended Experimental Procedures for more details on the rationale for these boundary conditions . Boundary conditions for the vesicle geometry do not directly produce a solution with Matlab’s bvp4c boundary value problem solver . A technique known as continuation was used to ﬁnd the desired solution . The solution for a less stringent boundary condition ( i . e . , giving a less bent membrane ) with r ð 0 Þ = 7 ; r ð 10 Þ = 1 was ﬁrst computed and used as initial guess for a subsequent iteration with a slightly greater value of r ð 0 Þ . This process was then repeated until the desired r ð 0 Þ = 20 condition was met . Finally , the same process was used to decrease r ð 10 Þ from 1 to the desired value r d . Once membrane shapes were computed , we calculated the corresponding energy by numerical integration of Canham - Helfrich Hamiltonian . Theory for Reduced Fission Energy Barrier at the Dynamin - Membrane Edge We model membrane ﬁssion as a one - step reaction thermally activated with a single energy barrier , biased by the GTP hydrolysis driven constriction force . The radius R d , that is , the radius of the dynamin - coated membrane , constitutes the reaction coordinate . In this analogy , the radius R d is a brownian degree of freedom that may overcome a ﬁssion energy barrier by thermal ﬂuctuations . GTP hydrolysis by dynamin generates a constriction force which in our model would operate as a force on the R d degree of freedom , tilting the energy landscape and decreasing the total energy barrier D E tot to a smaller value D E res , biasing the transition toward the ﬁssion state ( see Figure 2A in main text ) . The energy barrier originates from differences in elastic and surface energy of the membrane neck that joins the edge of the dy - namin - coated part to the bare tube with radius R d , set by tension and bending rigidity . After constriction , the residual barrier can be overcome by thermal ﬂuctuations of the constricted radius , at a rate r = t ! 1 e ! D E res = k b T where t is a molecular characteristic time of reaction , k b is the Boltzmann constant , T the temperature . A constant rate of reaction yields an average ﬁssion time h t f i = t e D E res = k b T A process with just one constant rate of reaction r gives an exponential distribution of reaction times r ð t f Þ = re ! rt f and consequently a cumulative probability of reaction F ð t f Þ = Z t f 0 r ð x Þ dx = 1 ! e ! rt f : Our experiments both present an exponential distribution of ﬁssion times ( data not shown ) and the corresponding cumulative prob - ability is well ﬁt by 1 ! e ! rt f as shown in Figure 3B in the main text . To compute the bending and surface energy of the membrane we numerically solved the nonlinear shape equation that arises from Canham - Helfrich Hamiltonian minimization ( see above ) for the neck joining a bare membrane tube with a dynamin - coated one ( see Figure 1G in the main text ) . This implies boundary conditions where the radius matches the bare tube radius R m on one side and R d , the radius of the dynamin - coated part , on the other . In both ends , the derivative of the radius with respect to the axial coordinate must vanish to smoothly join either the bare or dynamin - coated tube . The equation was numerically solved using Matlab bvp4c boundary problem solver for different values of R d and constant R m . From the shape , we compute the bending and surface energy energy E ( a ) as a function of dimensionless parameter a = R m / R d , as depicted in Figure 2B . To estimate the energy barrier we assume dynamin polymerizes and constricts the dynamin - coated membrane very fast compared to ﬁssion times ( Morlot et al . , 2010 ) to a radius R c of the order of 4 - 5nm in the presence of GTP ( the actual R c should depend on GTP concentration in our model as ﬁssion time decreases with increasing GTP concentration ; we nevertheless disregard this dependence for the sake of simplicity by taking a ﬁxed GTP concentration and defer the discussion on the effect of GTP concentration for a later section ) . The coated membrane tube is still connected to the bare membrane tube by a neck - like shape . In order for the membrane to break , it makes a transition from this conﬁguration with R d = R c , to another with a constricted radius R d = R i corresponding to a hemiﬁssion intermediate state with a radius R i independent of tension and bending rigidity . A hemiﬁssion intermediate is a state where the internal monolayer of the membrane is fused while the outer monolayer keeps its integrity . Evidence for the existence of a hemiﬁssion state has already been reported in ( Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ) . Kozlovsky and Kozlov have proven for a different but related geometry where a constricted neck also exists that once this hemiﬁssion intermediate is attained the transition to complete ﬁssion proceeds spontaneously , due to a negative free energy difference between hemiﬁssion and complete ﬁssion state ( Kozlovsky S4 Cell 151 , 619 – 629 , October 26 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . and Kozlov , 2003 ) . We assume there is no barrier once the hemiﬁssion is attained and therefore the ﬁssion reaction quickly proceeds to ﬁssion . Hence , the energy barrier is the difference between the energy of these two conﬁgurations D E tuberes = E $ R m R i ’ ! E $ R m R c ’ h E tubei ! E tubec : Taking R i of the order of 3 - 5nm and R c in the range 4 - 5nm and for the R m used in our experiment , the ratio a ranges from 1 to 10 , which allows us to approximate E ( a ) by a straight line with slope a x 1 = 4 and get an analytical prediction of the barrier dependence with tension and bending modulus E x a 2 pk ð a ! 1 Þ 0 D E tuberes x 2 p a $ 1 R i ! 1 R c ’ k 3 = 2 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 s p ; where we already substituted the value of the bare membrane radius Rm = ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k = 2 s p . The average ﬁssion time thus depends on membrane parameters as h t f i = t e b k 3 = 2 kbT ﬃﬃ s p giving for log h t f i a dependence log h t f i = log t + b k 3 = 2 k b T ﬃﬃﬃ s p ; which ﬁts all the experimental data for different values of k and s as shown in Figure 3 in the main text . Fission at GUV - Dynamin or Bead - Dynamin Edge As explained in the main text , ﬁssion occurs preferentially at the boundary between the tube and the GUV or between the tube and the bead . To analyze these cases we solved the shape equation with a modiﬁed boundary condition at GUV / bead’s end . Due to the difference in size between the tube and the bead or GUV we can approximate GUV / bead by an inﬁnite ﬂat membrane wall perpen - dicular to the tube . This can be mimicked in the numeric computations by requiring that membrane radius at the wall ( GUV ) is much bigger than R d and that membrane joins smoothly to a ﬂat membrane , i . e . , with vanishing curvature . At dynamin’s edge , membrane has a radius R d and enters the dynamin domain with vanishing slope to smoothly match the dynamin - coated tube . The dynamin coating is assumed to progress until a distance 10R m from the ﬂat wall . This coincides with the end of the bare tube that would form in the absence of dynamin ( Dere´nyi et al . , 2002 ) and we expect the dynamin polymer to grow approximately until that position . Varying R d again we can compute the energy as a function of a . The energy of the GUV - dynamin edge has the same approximate shape as in the bare tube - dynamin case ( see Figure 2B ) and therefore the above discussion remains valid , giving a similar depen - dence with k and s for ﬁssion time . Furthermore , the residual energy barrier for the vesicle or bead edge for k = 16k b T , R i = 3nm and R c = 4 . 5nm ranges from 20 k b T to 23 k b T as a function of tension s giving an expected ﬁssion time h t f i = t e D E ves reskbT ; which agrees with experimentally observed times . Using hydrodynamic arguments we can estimate t z 10 ! 9 s giving in turn ﬁssion times in the range [ 1 , 13 ] s depending on tension , in agreement with experimental ﬁssion times . Higher Probability of Fission at GUV’s End Differences in energy barrier for ﬁssion at the GUV - dynamin and at the tube - dynamin neck translate in different rates of ﬁssion . Dis - regarding differences in the number of tube - dynamin versus GUV - dynamin edges in front of the exponential factors , the probabilities to ﬁnd a break in the GUV or tube edge in an experiment would be proportional to the rates of ﬁssion . According to our model , rates are exponentially related and therefore : P ves P tube = e ! D E ves res = k B T e ! D E tuberes = k B T = e ð D E tuberes ! D E vesres Þ = k B T with D E tuberes and D E vesres the barriers for ﬁssion at the tube or vesicle respectively . Using normalization P ves + P tube = 1 we ﬁnd P ves = 1 1 + e ð D E ves res ! D E tube res Þ = k B T : Cell 151 , 619 – 629 , October 26 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . S5 Taking R i = 3nm , R c = 4 . 5nm and k = 16k b T , the numerical computation of the barriers from the surface and bending energy shows that the energy barrier at the vesicle edge is always smaller than the barrier corresponding to the tube , at least for the values of tension used in the experiment , as shown in Figure 2C . For tensions used in experiments from s x 1 3 10 ! 4 N : m ! 1 to s x 5 3 10 ! 4 N : m ! 1 , the difference in energy barriers D E tuberes ! D E vesres is in the range [ 1 , 3 ] 3 k b T , which in turn gives probabilities of ﬁssion in the vesicle P ves = ½ 0 : 75 ; 0 : 93 & in accordance with 75 % of the breaks occurring in the vesicle observed in experiment ( see Figure 1D ) . Effect of GTP Concentration The presence of GTP in the system , which entails dynamin contraction , is equivalent , at least for small deformations of the helix , to applying a homogeneous constriction force or pressure and a torque to the membrane in the dynamin domain proportional to Dm , the GTP hydrolysis chemical potential difference ( Lenz et al . , 2008 ) . In our model , that would mean that a constant force is applied to the radius variable , which can be seen as a tilt in the energy landscape proportional to Dm . Thus , the total energy barrier decreases in an amount proportional to Dm with a constant d that is related to the position of the intermediate state in the reaction path : D E res = D E tot ! d Dm = D E tot ! c Gq ; where we used the proportionality between Dm and dynamin induced torque upon hydrolysis G , which is derived assuming the energy for constriction is coming from GTP hydrolysis and thus work done by dynamin should be Gq = x D m where Dm is the variation of chemical potential in the hydrolysis and x can be thought of as an efﬁciency of dynamin in the sense of how much energy is con - verted into work . This gives for ﬁssion time h t f i = t e D EtotkbT ! c Gq kbT : Finally , assuming an ideal dynamin solution , D m = k b T log ½ GTP & and therefore h t f i = t e D EtotkbT ! c x log ½ GTP & : Experiments indeed show the expected dependence : log h t f i = constant ! c x log ½ GTP & as shown in Figure 4F of the main text . Torque and Final Helix Radius As the dynamin helix hydrolyses GTP , it exerts a torque which tends to constrict the underlying membrane tubule . This torque is counteracted by the elasticity of the membrane , which favors a widening of the tubule . Here we derive a mathematical expression for the membrane’s radius resulting from the balance of these two effects . We consider a cylindrical membrane constrained by a dy - namin helix and ﬁrst consider the geometrical relationships between the helix’ radius , pitch and length . We then use them to analyze the competition between dynamin torque and membrane elasticity . We approximate the dynamin helix by an inextensible ribbon wound around a cylinder of radius r and length L . No polymerization or depolymerization is assumed to take place over the time scales considered and the ribbon has an approximately constant width . Therefore , the total surface area of the ribbon is conserved : 2 p rL = 2 p R u L u ; where the index u refers to the initial state of the helix , prior to the introduction of GTP , when the dynamin helix is unconstricted . We deﬁne Q as the total winding angle of the ribbon , expressed in radian . For instance , a helix that winds three times around the cylinder has Q = 3 3 ð 2 p Þ . Denoting by h the helix’ pitch , this angle is given by Q 2 p = L h expressing the fact that adding one turn to the helix increases its length by h . To the level of approximation used here , we can assume that the pitch of the helix is constant and equal to 10nm . We denote by k the bending modulus of the membrane and assume that the tubule is in contact with a membrane reservoir of tension s . Due to the small radius of the tubule ( much smaller than the bare membrane equilibrium radius ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k = 2 s p ) , the energetic contribution of surface tension is small compared to the bending energy , and is neglected in the following . The bending energy of the membrane is given by the Canham - Helfrich energy presented in the main text . Its bending term is re - produced here for convenience : E bending = k 2 Z A c 2 dA : S6 Cell 151 , 619 – 629 , October 26 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . For a cylindrical geometry , the curvature of the tube is c = 1 = r and the integral runs over a surface A = 2 p rL . The bending energy thus reads pk L = r , which is minimal for a ﬂat membrane ð r / + N Þ . In the absence of GTP hydrolysis , the membrane is conﬁned to a ﬁnite radius R u by the rigidity of the dynamin helix . We represent this passive effect by an elastic equilibrium torque G u implying a contribution ! G u Q to the energy of the system . For the purpose of determining the membrane shape , the internal , active torque induced by the dynamin polymer upon GTP hydro - lysis is equivalent to an additional external torque G imposed on the passive helix . Therefore , dynamin activity can be described as a further lowering of the energy of the system by an amount equal to the work GQ of this torque . Summing all the contributions to the energy , we ﬁnd E = ! ð G u + G Þ Q + pk L r = ! ð G u + G Þ L u R u hr + pk L u R u r 2 : Minimizing E with respect to r , we ﬁnd that r = 2 pk h G u + G : While the passive torque G u has been left unspeciﬁed until this point , it must satisfy the condition that r goes to R u as goes to zero . This implies that G u = 2 pk h = R u , and therefore r = R u 1 + G R u 2 pk h : Using k = 20 kbT = 8 3 10 ! 20 J , we can thus compute the torque required to obtain a constricted radius r = R c = 5 nm to be G x 500 pN : nm . This value is compatible with the experimental measurements presented in the main text ( see Figure 4 ) , thus vali - dating our assessment of the role of the competition between dynamin torque and membrane bending rigidity .
