Non - pharmaceutical interventions were commonly 18 adopted for COVID - 19 prevention and control . However , during stable periods of the 19 pandemic , energy would be inevitably wasted if all interventions were implemented . 20 The study aims to reduce the building energy consumption when meet the demands of 21 epidemic prevention and control under the stable period of COVID - 19 . Based on the 22 improved Wells - Riley model considering dynamic quanta generation and pulmonary 23 ventilation rate , we established the infection risk - equivalent fresh air volume - 24 energy consumption model to analyzed the infection risk and building energy 25 consumption during different seasons and optimized the urban building energy 26 consumption according to the spatio - temporal population distribution . Shopping 27 centers and restaurants contributed the most in urban energy consumption , and if they 28 are closed during the pandemic , the total infection risk would be reduced by 25 % - 40 % 29 and 15 % - 25 % respectively and the urban energy consumption would be reduced by 30 30 % - 40 % and 13 % - 20 % respectively . If people wore masks in all public indoor 31 environments ( exclude restaurants and KTV ) , the infection risk could be reduced by 32 60 % - 70 % and the energy consumption could be reduced by 20 % - 60 % . Gyms pose the 33 highest risk for COVID - 19 transmission . If the energy consumption kept the same 34 with the current value , after the optimization , infection risk in winter , summer and the 35 transition season could be reduced by 65 % , 53 % and 60 % , respectively . After the 36 optimization , under the condition of R t < 1 , the energy consumption in winter , summer , 37 and the transition season could be reduced by 72 % , 64 % , and 68 % respectively . 38 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Keywords : COVID - 19 prevention and control ; building energy efficiency ; 39 non - pharmaceutical intervention ; infection risk ; indoor environment 40 41 1 . Introduction 42 43 By the end of 2021 , COVID - 19 had infected more than 273 million people and 44 killed 5 . 3 million people around the world [ 1 ] . More than 99 % of SARS - CoV - 2 45 infections occurred in indoor environments [ 2 ] . Long - range airborne transmission is 46 one of the main routes for SARS - CoV - 2 spread [ 3 - 5 ] . People use various 47 non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPI ) ( e . g . indoor ventilation , air purifiers , 48 ultraviolet , and masking ) to reduce the infection risk of COVID - 19 , with increasing 49 the fresh air exchange rate being the most popular intervention [ 6 - 9 ] . However , 50 excessive ventilation inevitably wastes energy , particularly on hot or cold days . As of 51 2022 , the global economy is expected to lose nearly $ 8 . 5 trillion [ 10 ] . In China , 52 energy consumption of HVAC systems increased by 128 % during the COVID - 19 53 pandemic [ 11 ] . This highlights the need to urgently reduce energy consumption while 54 simultaneously meeting the requirements of COVID - 19 prevention during stable 55 epidemic periods when only a few people are infected . 56 However , many indoor environments still implement the same high intensity 57 interventions during the stable period as are necessary during the pandemic outbreak . 58 Many organizations ( WHO , ASHRAE ) have proposed epidemic control measures for 59 the stable period , but these proposals have a number of problems [ 11 ] . Firstly , people 60 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f undertake different activities in different indoor environments [ 12 ] . Metabolic 61 intensity and types of indoor environments have an impact on personal exposure and 62 COVID - 19 prevention strategies , but few control measures consider these influencing 63 factors . Secondly , the viral RNA loads in the exhaled aerosols from an infected person 64 changes over time , and this is not considered in many models [ 13 ] . Thirdly , in the 65 traditional Wells - Riley model , virus inactivation and aerosol deposition are rarely 66 considered . Finally , most studies focus on COVID - 19 prevention and control for a 67 single indoor environment , ignoring the correlation of various indoor environments , 68 which makes it difficult to optimize building energy efficiency and infection risk 69 control for different indoor environments [ 14 ] . 70 Many models such as Computational Fluid Dynamics ( CFD ) , Gaussian 71 dispersion model , and Wells - Riley model were used for simulation on virus 72 transmission via long - range airborne route . CFD model could accurately assess the 73 virus exposure based on detailed parameters of indoor environment , such as the 74 position of air vents and indoor objects , however , it would take a long time and is 75 generally used in a single indoor environment [ 15 ] . Although with lower accuracy 76 than CFD , Gaussian dispersion model could obtain real - time virus exposure according 77 to the indoor wind speed and the movement of the infected and susceptible people 78 [ 16 - 17 ] . However , it is almost impossible for simulation on large numbers of indoor 79 environments because of long time consumption and detailed requirements on indoor 80 parameters . 81 Wells - Riley model is often used to simulate the virus transmission via 82 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f long - range airborne route [ 18 ] . The model provided the quantitative relationship 83 between infection risk and fresh air volume with the constant virus generation rate . 84 However , the traditional Wells - Riley model does not consider the time - variant 85 attenuation of virus generation by the patient and the inhalation and exhalation rate 86 under different metabolism ( e . g . exercising , standing , sitting ) . It may lead to a great 87 impact on the accuracy of the results . In this study , we developed an improved 88 Wells - Riley model that considers dynamic virus generation and pulmonary ventilation 89 rate for different human activities in various indoor environments . We considered 10 90 typical indoor environments , three seasons ( summer , winter , and a transition season ) 91 and four population groups ( workers , students , the elderly , and the immobile ) for 92 optimizing COVID - 19 infection risk ( R t < 1 ) and energy consumption . The results of 93 this study will help to intelligently balance controlling COVID - 19 transmission and 94 reducing energy consumption , which is very important for sustainable cities and 95 society . 96 97 2 . Methods 98 99 2 . 1 Infection risk - energy consumption model 100 101 2 . 1 . 1 Improved Wells - Riley model 102 103 The Wells - Riley model is usually used to evaluate virus transmission via 104 long - range airborne routes . 105 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 𝑃 = 𝐶 𝑆 = 1 − 𝑒𝑥𝑝⁡ ( − 𝐼𝑝𝑞𝑡 𝑄 ) ( 1 ) where 𝑃 is the probability of infection ; C is the number of people infected via 106 long - range airborne transmission ; S is the initial number of susceptible people ; I is the 107 number of the infected ( assumed to be 1 in each indoor environment ) ; q is the quanta 108 generation rate ( / h ) ; p is the pulmonary ventilation rate ( set to 0 . 4 m 3 / h resting state ) ; 109 Q is the indoor fresh air ventilation rate ( m 3 / h ) . 110 Quanta was assumed to be a constant value in the traditional Wells - Riley model . 111 However , measurement of exhaled aerosols of infected individuals has shown that the 112 viral RNA load decreases gradually after the onset of symptoms . Therefore , the 113 quanta generation rate should also decrease with time . The infectious period of 114 COVID - 19 is set to 10 days [ 19 ] . According to measured data of viral RNA loads , the 115 quanta produced by the infected can be calculated as : 116 𝛿 ( 𝑡′ ) = 10 ( − 𝑡′24 ) ( 2 ) where , t ' is the number of hours since the onset of the infectious period ; 𝛿 ( 𝑡′ ) is the 117 attenuation coefficient for quanta generation . 118 Metabolic intensity determines the inhalation and exhalation rates . Therefore , the 119 quanta generation rate of the infected would be higher if the pulmonary ventilation 120 rate is higher . The metabolic intensity coefficients in different indoor environments 121 are m ( the multiple of pulmonary ventilation rate to resting state ) , set as follows : at 122 home , m is 1 ; in classrooms , offices , subways , and restaurants , m is 1 . 25 ; in cinemas , 123 shopping malls , railway stations / airports , and Karaoke Televisions ( KTVs ) , m is 1 . 5 ; 124 in gyms , m is 2 [ 20 ] . 125 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Time - variant virus generation rate during the infectious period of patients [ 19 ] and 126 dynamic exposure velocity influenced by the human activities ( e . g . exercising , 127 standing ) were considered into the improved Wells - Riley model , can be expressed as 128 ( Eq . ( 3 ) ) : 129 𝑃 = 1 − 𝑒𝑥𝑝 ( − 𝐼 ∙ 𝑚 2 ∙ 𝑝 ∙ ∑ 𝑞 0 ∙ 𝛿 ( 𝑡 ′ ) 𝑡𝑡 ′ = 0 𝑄 ) ( 3 ) where , ⁡𝑞 0 indicates the initial quanta generation rate at the onset of symptoms , set to 130 48 h - 1 [ 18 ] . 131 132 2 . 1 . 2 Energy consumption model 133 134 Energy consumption of air conditioning system is defined as the cooling and 135 heating load of the central air conditioning system and split air conditioning used in 136 residential buildings , excluding the energy consumption of water pumps , cooling 137 towers and other related equipment . Air conditioning system is defined as the central 138 air conditioning system in public buildings or split air conditioning used in residential 139 buildings , excluding water pumps , cooling towers , and other related equipment . In 140 order to find the balance between COVID - 19 prevention ( R t < 1 ) and energy 141 consumption , an energy consumption model based on human comfort was established . 142 Based on the infection risk - energy consumption model , we developed an optimization 143 strategy that considers both energy consumption and epidemic control for different 144 population groups , in various indoor environments during the stable epidemic period . 145 146 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f ( 1 ) Season , population group and indoor environment 147 The energy consumption to ensure indoor human comfort , changes with the 148 seasons . For our purposes we considered three seasons : winter , summer and a 149 transition season . In this study , winter ( January , February , November and December ) , 150 summer ( June , July , August , and September ) , and transition season ( March , April , 151 May , and October ) was divided based on the temperature distribution ( Appendix K ) . 152 In addition , due to different commuting patterns , the population was divided into four 153 categories : student , worker , the elderly ( aged between 61 and 80 ) , and the immobile 154 ( aged under 3 and over 80 ) [ 21 ] . Previous studies showed that the daily movement of 155 students , workers , the elderly , and the immobile is quite different [ 21 ] . By analyzing 156 the spatio - temporal distribution of these four population groups , the strategy on 157 COVID - 19 prevention and control and urban energy consumption reduction 158 simultaneously considering 10 types of indoor environments could be optimized . As 159 of November 2020 , there were 21 . 9 million people in Beijing ( students 10 . 1 % , 160 workers 71 . 9 % , the elderly 10 . 5 % , and the immobile 7 . 5 % ) [ 22 ] . The 10 typical 161 indoor environments we considered were : home , office , classroom , restaurant , subway , 162 shopping center , railway station / airport , cinema , KTV , and gym . 163 164 ( 2 ) Equivalent fresh air volume 165 We adopted the concept of equivalent fresh air volume , which refers to all 166 methods that can remove indoor viruses ( e . g . natural inactivation , deposition , human 167 inhalation , and some NPIs ) ( Eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) ) . We considered four NPIs including 168 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f indoor ventilation , air purification , ultraviolet ( UV - C ) , and mask wearing . 169 𝑄 𝑑 = 𝐴𝐶𝐻 𝐸 ∗ 𝑉 ( 4 ) 𝐴𝐶𝐻 𝐸 = 𝐴𝐶𝐻 𝑣 + 𝐴𝐶𝐻 𝑎𝑝 + 𝐴𝐶𝐻 𝑢𝑣 + 𝐴𝐶𝐻 𝑑 + 𝐴𝐶𝐻 𝑠 + 𝐴𝐶𝐻 𝑖𝑛 ( 5 ) where , 𝑄 𝑑 is equivalent fresh air volume ( m 3 / h ) ; 𝑉 is the volume of the indoor 170 environment ( m 3 ) ; 𝐴𝐶𝐻 𝐸 is the equivalent air change rate ( ACH ) of the indoor 171 environment ; 𝐴𝐶𝐻 𝑣 is the actual ACH ; 𝐴𝐶𝐻 𝑎𝑝 and 𝐴𝐶𝐻 𝑢𝑣 are the equivalent ACH 172 by the air purifier and the UV - C , respectively ; 𝐴𝐶𝐻 𝑑 and 𝐴𝐶𝐻 𝑠 are the equivalent 173 ACH due to virus inactivation and aerosol deposition ; 𝐴𝐶𝐻 𝑖𝑛 is the equivalent ACH 174 due to inhalation by people . The calculations for all the equivalent ACHs mentioned 175 above are shown in Appendix A . 176 In addition , our study also considered the impact of mask wearing on reducing 177 exposure . Wearing masks can reduce both virus generation and exposure . Surgical 178 masks , which are commonly used , reduce viral copy numbers in the fine fraction 179 2 . 8 - fold ( 95 % CI 1 . 5 - 5 . 2 ) and in the coarse fraction 25 - fold ( 95 % CI 3 . 5 - 180 ) [ 7 ] . 180 Using the above formulas , we can calculate the equivalent fresh air ventilation 181 according to the specific epidemic prevention measures being taken in the indoor 182 environment . 183 In the case where the prevention measure was mask wearing , the 10 indoor 184 environments were divided into three categories : no - mask indoor environments ( home , 185 restaurant , KTV , and gym ) , familiar indoor environments ( office , classroom ) , and 186 strange indoor environments ( subway , shopping center , railway station / airport , 187 cinema ) . Then in the simulation , we considered 3 conditions for mask wearing : ( 1 ) 188 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f only worn in strange indoor environments ; ( 2 ) only worn in both familiar and strange 189 indoor environments ; ( 3 ) worn nowhere . More detailed information on mask wearing 190 can be found in Appendix B . 191 192 ( 3 ) Energy consumption 193 The quantitative relationship between equivalent fresh air volume and building 194 energy consumption is shown in Eq . ( 6 ) : 195 𝑒 = 𝑒 𝑅 + 𝑒 𝑓𝑎𝑛 + 𝑒 𝑎𝑝 + 𝑒 𝑢𝑣 ( 6 ) where 𝑒 ( kW ) is the building energy consumption for epidemic prevention and 196 control ; 𝑒 𝑅 ( kW ) is the building energy consumption to maintain the indoor 197 temperature for human comfort considering ventilation from the outdoor fresh air ; 198 𝑒 𝑓𝑎𝑛 ( kW ) is the energy consumption of fans bringing outdoor fresh air indoors ; 𝑒 𝑎𝑝 199 ( kW ) is the energy consumption of air purifiers ; 𝑒 𝑢𝑣 ( kW ) is the energy consumption 200 of UV - C . 201 When providing outdoor fresh air , it is necessary to balance the heating or cooling 202 load required to maintain the indoor air temperature . The quantitative relationship 203 between the actual fresh air volume and energy consumption in the indoor 204 environment is shown in Eq . ( 7 ) [ 23 ] . 205 𝑒 𝑅 = 𝜌 𝑎 𝑄 𝑟 ∆ℎ𝑡 𝐶𝑂𝑃 ( 7 ) where t is the time of ventilation ; 𝑄 𝑟 is the actual air volume ( m 3 / h ) ; ⁡𝜌 𝑎 is the air 206 density ( 1 . 293 kg / m 3 ) ; ∆h is the enthalpy difference between indoors and outdoors 207 ( kJ / kg ) ; The coefficient of performance ( COP ) is the air conditioning energy 208 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f efficiency coefficient , which is set to be 3 . 5 in winter and the transition season , and 3 209 in summer [ 24 ] . when calculating the actual fresh air volume to maintain indoor 210 temperature and relative humidity , ∆h changes according to season ( Appendix C ) . 211 Energy consumption of the fan ( 𝑒 𝑓𝑎𝑛 ) can be obtained from Eq . ( 8 ) . To simplify the 212 calculation , we assumed a specific fan - power of 1 kW·m - 3 ·s for ventilation systems 213 without heat - recovery [ 25 - 26 ] . 214 𝑒 𝑓𝑎𝑛 = ∫ 𝑆𝐹𝑃 . 𝑄𝑑𝑡 = 𝑆𝐹𝑃 . 𝑄 ∫ 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑄𝑡 𝑡 0 𝑡 0 ( 8 ) Energy consumption of UV - C is 40 W / h for every 40 m 2 and for air purification is 45 215 W / h for an air volume of 350 m 3 [ 27 ] . The detailed selection of UV - C and air purifier 216 can be found in Appendix D . 217 218 2 . 2 The optimized sequence of interventions 219 220 When finding the minimum energy consumption to meet the requirements of 221 epidemic prevention , epidemic prevention takes precedence over human comfort . 222 Finally , we determined the sequence of interventions to be as follows ( Fig . 1 ) . 223 224 Fig . 1 . The sequence of interventions considering energy consumption , COVID - 19 225 prevention , and human comfort . 226 227 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f A national standard for fresh air volume ( SV ) in each indoor environment was the 228 first requirement ( detailed values are given in Table S2 ) . After that , providing 229 comfortable fresh air ( CV ) , using air purifiers ( AP ) , and opening UV - C ( UV ) were 230 selected for COVID - 19 prevention . The order in which these above - mentioned 231 interventions should be performed depends on the energy consumption for the 232 specific condition . Detailed settings for air purifiers and UV - C can be found in 233 Appendix D . If COVID - 19 cannot be controlled ( R t > 1 ) even after all the above 234 interventions have been implemented , extra air purifiers ( EAP ) would be used ( the 235 number of extra air purifiers is set according to Appendix D ) . Finally , triple 236 comfortable fresh air volume ( TV ) was used to minimize the infection risk of 237 SARS - CoV - 2 . 238 239 2 . 3 Urban energy consumption 240 241 To calculate urban energy consumptions , we obtained the opening and closing 242 times of the 10 typical indoor environments ( Table S4 ) . 243 𝐸 = ∑ 𝑁 ( 𝑖𝑒 ) ∗ 𝑡 ( 𝑖𝑒 ) ∗ 𝑒 ℎ ( 𝑖𝑒 ) 10 𝑖𝑒 = 1 ( 9 ) where 𝐸 is the daily energy consumption in Beijing ( kW ) ; ⁡𝑁 ( 𝑖𝑒 ) is the total number 244 of each type of indoor environment ( ie ) in Beijing ; 𝑡 ( 𝑖𝑒 ) is the time spent ( hours ) by 245 people in a specific indoor environment per day ; 𝑒 ℎ ( 𝑖𝑒 ) is the hourly energy 246 consumption for a specific indoor environment ( kW · h - 1 ) . 247 248 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2 . 3 . 1 Single scenario optimization 249 250 The effective reproductive number R t is defined as the expected number of 251 secondary cases ( second - generation patients ) infected by one infected person 252 ( first - generation patients ) [ 18 ] . If R t < 1 , the disease would eventually die out . 253 If we can ensure that R t in each indoor environment is less than 1 , the final R t will 254 be less than 1 no matter how people spent their time in the different indoor 255 environments [ 28 ] . If R t < 1 could be satisfied when the infected person stays in the 256 same indoor environment during their entire infectious period , R t < 1 in all indoor 257 environments could be achieved . The above epidemic prevention strategy is called 258 local optimization . According to the sequence of NPIs we proposed ( Fig . 1 ) , the 259 relationship between equivalent fresh air volume and energy consumption was 260 obtained . Based on the relationship between R t and the probability of infection 261 ( Appendix F ) , the relationship between R t and equivalent fresh air volume was 262 calculated based on the improved Wells - Riley model . Finally , the relationship 263 between energy consumption of each indoor environment , and R t was obtained . In 264 general , the relationship between R t , equivalent fresh air volume , probability of 265 infection , and energy consumption was quantitatively obtained . 266 267 2 . 3 . 2 Multi scenarios optimization 268 269 In actuality , infected people do not usually stay in the same indoor environment 270 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f for the whole infectious period . Since energy would be wasted if we assumed R t < 1 271 held in all types of indoor environments , we need to find the best epidemic prevention 272 strategy according to the length of time people spend in the different indoor 273 environments per day . Based on 300 questionnaires ( Appendix G ) and a previous 274 study [ 29 ] , the time spent by the four population groups ( worker , student , the elderly , 275 and the immobile ) in each indoor environment during the stable pandemic period is 276 shown in Table 1 . 277 278 Table 1 . Time spent ( h ) by the four population groups in 10 typical indoor 279 environments . 280 Indoor environment Worker Student Elderly The immobile Home 12h 12h 17 . 5h 24h Office 8h - - - Classroom - 8h - - Restaurant 1h 1h 1h - Subway 1 . 1h 0 . 9h 0 . 7h - Shopping center 0 . 6h 0 . 4h 1h - Railway station / airport 0 . 04h 0 . 04h 0 . 04h - Cinema 0 . 04h 0 . 04h 0 . 04h - KTV 0 . 04h 0 . 04h 0 . 04h - Gym 1 0 . 21h 0 . 21h - - 1 Because the proportion of fit elderly is low , we ignored the time the elderly spent in a gym . 281 282 According to the distribution of time spent indoors by the four groups of people 283 in different indoor environments , a strategy to optimize energy consumption and 284 infection risk control can be developed . We call this strategy population - based 285 optimization . Considering that each population group has its own optimal strategy , in 286 order to meet the demands for COVID - 19 control , we adopt the most stringent 287 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f strategy for each indoor environment for each population group , and this is called the 288 global general optimization . However , with the global general optimization , if all 289 indoor environments meet the most stringent epidemic prevention requirements , it 290 will mean excessive measures for epidemic prevention in the other three population 291 groups , which in turn means an unnecessary waste of energy . Therefore , we 292 considered the distribution of the four population groups in Beijing ( 10 . 1 % for 293 students , 71 . 9 % for workers , 10 . 5 % for the elderly and 7 . 5 % for the immobile ) , and 294 obtained the more refined global optimization . We can then obtain the daily energy 295 consumption in Beijing to meet the requirements of epidemic prevention . 296 When calculating the epidemic spread , we assume that the R t distribution in each 297 indoor environment ranged from 0 to 5 with a resolution of 0 . 01 . Taking energy 298 consumption as the optimization objective , the optimal distribution of R t in different 299 indoor environments were obtained . The minimum R t would be achieved when all 300 interventions shown in Fig . 1 were implemented . 301 302 3 . Results 303 304 3 . 1 Local optimal solution for each indoor environment 305 306 3 . 1 . 1 Per capita energy consumption 307 308 Energy consumption increases with the increase of per capita equivalent fresh air 309 volume ( Fig . 2 and Appendix H ) . As heat production by the human body increases the 310 cooling load in summer and reduces the heating load in both winter and transition 311 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f seasons , energy consumption is the highest in summer when the per capita equivalent 312 air volume is low . However , because the enthalpy difference in winter is greater than 313 that in summer and transition seasons , with the increase in per capita equivalent fresh 314 air volume , the energy consumption in winter becomes gradually greater than that in 315 summer and transition seasons . With no mask wearing , in order to control COVID - 19 316 transmission ( R t < 1 ) , the per capita energy consumption of subways is the highest 317 ( 1 . 3 kW / h / p in winter , 0 . 6 kW / h / p in summer , and 0 . 5 kW / h / p in the transition season ) ; 318 and of homes is the lowest ( 0 . 02 kW / h / p in winter , 0 . 015 kW / h / p in summer and 0 . 01 319 kW / h / p in the transition season ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Classrooms , railway stations / airports , 320 cinemas , KTVs and gyms cannot meet epidemic prevention requirements , even if all 321 the above interventions are taken , for example , R t in gyms is greater than 5 . 322 When masks are worn , the per capita energy consumption of subways is still the 323 highest ( 0 . 1 kW / h / p in winter , 0 . 2 kW / h / p in summer and 0 . 05 kW / h / p in the 324 transition season ) ; while the per capita energy consumption of offices is the lowest 325 ( 0 . 01 kW / h / p in winter , 0 . 04 kW / h / p in summer and 0 . 005 kW / h / p in the transition 326 season ) . The lowest R t in homes , offices , classrooms , restaurants , subways , shopping 327 center , railway stations / airports , cinemas and KTVs when all interventions were 328 strictly implemented without ( with ) masks are 0 . 04 , 0 . 52 ( 0 . 07 ) , 1 . 1 ( 0 . 15 ) , 0 . 89 , 0 . 9 329 ( 0 . 12 ) , 0 . 66 ( 0 . 09 ) , 1 . 34 ( 0 . 18 ) , 1 . 39 ( 0 . 18 ) , 1 . 56 respectively .

When the epidemic prevention is weak ( R t would be high ) , UV - C and air purifiers 350 have important roles in epidemic prevention and control for energy efficiency , but 351 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f when the epidemic prevention requirements are high , ventilation contributes more . 352 353 Fig . 3 . The relationship between equivalent fresh air volume and effective 354 reproduction number ( R t ) in 10 typical indoor environments . 355 356 The energy consumption due to ventilation accounted on average , for more than 357 80 % of the total energy consumed ( Fig . 4 ) . In subways and shopping centers , the 358 energy consumption due to ventilation was more than 95 % . 359 When people wear masks to achieve a minimum R t , in offices , classrooms , subways , 360 shopping centers , railway stations / airports and cinemas , the energy consumption is 361 reduced by 80 % - 98 % , 67 % - 98 % , 77 % - 97 % , 77 % - 98 % , 63 % - 98 % and 57 % - 98 % 362 respectively .

Daily urban building energy consumption for the population 373 group - based optimization will produce a great waste of energy . Energy consumption 374 under global optimization could be reduced by about 20 % compared with the energy 375 consumption for the population group - based optimization , and it could also meet the 376 requirements of COVID - 19 prevention and control . Homes and shopping centers 377 consumed the most energy , accounting for 37 % and 31 % in winter , 29 % and 39 % in 378 summer , and 39 % and 21 % in the transition season , respectively . Cinemas and KTVs 379 consumed the least energy , accounting for 1 - 2 % in all seasons . If masks are strictly 380 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f worn in offices , classrooms , subways , shopping centers , railway stations / airports and 381 cinemas , energy consumption could be reduced by 19 % , 60 % , and 59 % in summer , 382 winter , and transition seasons , respectively . 383 384 Fig . 5 . Daily urban building energy consumption for different optimizations . 385 386 3 . 2 . 2 Energy consumption during different indoor environment shutdowns 387 388 To control the spread of an epidemic as soon as possible , some public indoor 389 environments could be closed , which will also affect urban energy consumption . 390 Summer is the season when COVID - 19 prevention and control measures result in the 391 highest energy consumption , followed by winter and then the transition season . When 392 railway stations / airports , cinemas and KTVs are closed , even though there is no 393 energy consumption by these buildings at that time , the total urban energy 394 consumption increases by 1 % - 5 % because people then spend more time in their 395 homes . If indoor environments that have high energy consumption are closed ( e . g . 396 shopping centers and restaurants ) , urban energy consumption would be significantly 397 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f reduced , a reduction of 31 . 5 - 40 . 2 % when shopping centers are closed , and 12 . 6 - 20 . 5 % 398 when restaurants are closed . This means that closing public indoor environments can 399 reduce the infection risk , but may not reduce total urban energy consumption . 400 401 Fig . 6 . Energy consumption for each / all indoor environment suspension . ( Everyone 402 was assumed to stay at home when a specific indoor environment is closed . The 403 circles show the proportion of energy consumption of each indoor environment ) . 404 405 3 . 2 . 3 R t distribution under different mask wearing conditions based on the global 406 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f optimization 407 408 Based on the global optimization , if people do not wear masks in all public 409 indoor environments , the COVID - 19 prevention strategy of restaurants , shopping 410 centers and KTVs would be weakest ( R t is the highest ) in summer and winter , and of 411 homes and offices should be the strongest ( Fig . 7a ) . The COVID - 19 prevention 412 strategy in the transition season is quite different from those used in winter and 413 summer . COVID - 19 prevention strategies in restaurants and KTVs during the 414 transition season are stricter than those in winter and summer . The energy 415 consumption of indoor environments in summer is different from that in winter and 416 the transition season ( Fig . 7b ) . Without considering human heat production , in winter 417 and transition seasons , the difference of per capita energy consumption in each indoor 418 environment is greater than that in summer . Based on the global optimization , the 419 interventions in the indoor environment could be partially reduced , and the energy 420 consumption in winter and transition season is low because of human heat production . 421 422 ( a ) 423 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 424 ( b ) 425 Fig . 7 .

When compared to the local 432 pure - ventilation strategy ( Strategy 2 ) , local optimization saves energy by 30 % - 60 % ; 433 population group - based optimization saves energy by 70 % - 90 % ; global optimization 434 without masks ( Strategy 5 ) saves energy by 75 % - 95 % . Compared to Strategy 5 , 435 Global optimization with masks saves energy by 20 % - 60 % . Of all the indoor 436 environments , with global optimization , the most energy was saved for shopping 437 centers , and the least for homes . 438 439 Table 3 .

Discussion 456 457 In this work , we developed an improved Wells - Riley model that considers 458 dynamic quanta generation and variable pulmonary ventilation rates , in different 459 indoor environments as a result of the intensity of human activity . We then established 460 an infection risk - energy consumption model . We considered four common NPIs , and 461 using these models were able to propose the COVID - 19 prevention strategy that will 462 achieve the lowest daily urban building energy consumption , for three seasons and 10 463 indoor environments . 464 The traditional Wells - Riley model is used to calculate infection risk of virus 465 transmission via long - range airborne route [ 30 ] . The model provided the quantitative 466 relationship between infection risk and fresh air ventilation considering the constant 467 personal virus generation rate and inhalation . However , in the traditional Wells - Riley 468 model , virus generation ( quanta ) was considered as a constant value during the whole 469 infectious period [ 31 ] . Moreover , the personal inhalation and exhalation was also a 470 constant , which does not take the impact of the change of inhalation and exhalation by 471 metabolic intensity of human body due to different activities ( e . g . exercising , standing ) 472 into account [ 32 - 33 ] . However , the time - variant attenuation rate of virus generation 473 rate ( quanta ) gradually decreased during the infectious period and the personal 474 inhalation and exhalation rate would be determined by human activities . 475 In the COVID - 19 pandemic , in order to quickly control the spread of the 476 epidemic , some extreme methods ( maximal ventilation ) may be used to achieve the 477 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f purpose without considering the energy conservation . It would inevitably cause a lot 478 of energy waste if the same strategy was used in stable period of the pandemic [ 34 ] . 479 In China , the objective of “dynamic clearing” appeals providing moderate 480 interventions on COVID - 19 during the stable period of the pandemic ( R t < 1 ) [ 35 ] . 481 Chinese President Xi put forward the goal of carbon peak and carbon neutral [ 36 ] . 482 Therefore , it is important to carry out epidemic prevention and control under low 483 building energy consumption during the stable period of the pandemic . 484 Because COVID - 19 is known to spread via long - range airborne transmission , 485 NPIs such as ventilation , air purification , ultraviolet , and mask wearing were adopted 486 to reduce infection risk [ 37 - 40 ] . Natural ventilation is one of the most effective 487 interventions for COVID - 19 prevention and control for all indoor environments , 488 however , high natural ventilation rates can lead to human discomfort , and waste 489 building energy . Air purification is one of the most energy - saving interventions , and 490 can ensure air circulation in the local zone , however , it may increase noise pollution . 491 UV - C , which consumes little energy , is good for COVID - 19 prevention and control 492 without noise pollution , however , it is harmful to the human body , and must be used 493 strictly according to safe standards [ 41 ] . Mask wearing is a convenient , economical , 494 and effective intervention . Many agencies ( e . g . WHO , ASHRAE ) and researchers 495 have stressed the importance of wearing masks during the COVID - 19 pandemic [ 42 ] . 496 We found that mask wearing is not only an effective intervention for COVID - 19 497 prevention , but also the most effective way to prevent the additional energy 498 consumption of other NPIs . However , wearing a mask indoors can make the wearer 499 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f feel uncomfortable . Therefore , in this paper we analyze these four NPIs to provide 500 additional information on which strategies to balance disease prevention and energy 501 use will be acceptable . This will prove useful in cases where people cannot wear 502 masks for a long time , such as in restaurants , KTVs , and gyms , or even in 503 environments where it is just uncomfortable for people to wear masks for a long time . 504 Most contemporary studies focus on interventions for COVID - 19 prevention in a 505 single indoor environment [ 14 ] . In some offices , air purification and an ultraviolet 506 system were used simultaneously , and ventilation was increased by 50 % to prevent 507 COVID - 19 spread [ 11 ] . In subways , ventilation was increased to the maximum to 508 reduce the infection risk caused by high population density . In classrooms , during the 509 pandemic , schools carried out online teaching to shield students from infection , and 510 advocated paying attention to hand hygiene , disinfecting hands and increasing 511 ventilation [ 43 ] . However , none of these studies looked at different indoor 512 environments based on real data of people ' s activities , and how long they stay , in 513 different indoor environments . Although the obtained interventions could achieve the 514 requirements for COVID - 19 prevention ( R t < 1 ) , some would lead to energy waste 515 [ 44 ] . Considering how people really behave indoors ( e . g . the distribution of time 516 spent indoors , their activities ) , we found that shopping centers and restaurants were 517 the environments that had high infection risk , and so should receive more attention . 518 The serious COVID - 19 outbreak in Xinfadi shopping center [ 45 ] in Beijing and 519 another in a restaurant in Guangzhou , underline the high risk of these indoor 520 environments [ 46 ] . Many countries realized this fact and closed restaurants [ 47 ] and 521 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f shopping centers [ 48 ] during the pandemic . Using our analysis , restaurants and 522 shopping centers could be kept open if appropriate interventions were implemented 523 based on the global optimization method . However , when it is necessary to control 524 COVID - 19 transmission rapidly , closing restaurants and shopping centers during the 525 outbreak is recommended . In addition , since shopping centers have extremely high 526 energy consumption , a lot of energy could be saved by closing them while R t is high . 527 People are generally very active in gyms , and this increased activity generates more 528 virus by the infected and therefore the susceptible are subjected to greater exposure 529 [ 49 ] . We found that no matter what intervention was implemented in a gym , it is 530 impossible to achieve the required COVID - 19 prevention . Therefore , some gyms 531 should be closed during the outbreak , and many countries did indeed close gyms to 532 reduce the infection risk [ 50 ] . We believe that gyms can be opened during a stable 533 period of the epidemic , but when there is a confirmed case , some gyms should be 534 closed with the highest priority . KTV is also a high - infection risk indoor environment 535 because of higher virus generation and inhalation . The virus production rate of people 536 singing is 8 . 38 times higher than for breathing [ 32 ] . In a choir in Washington , USA , 537 53 out of 61 participants were infected from a single case [ 33 ] . 538 Homes are also a critical environment for COVID - 19 transmission . 70 % of all 539 COVID - 19 patients were infected in a home [ 51 ] . People spent 12 hours at home per 540 day before the pandemic , and this increased to 15 hours during the epidemic [ 29 ] We 541 found that the average energy consumption for homes during the pandemic , accounted 542 for about 40 % of the total urban building energy consumption . 543 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Workers and students usually account for the majority of a city ' s population . They 544 frequently have complicated daily commutes . Schools and offices also connect people 545 from different zones in a city . Because schools and offices are familiar places , few 546 people kept wearing masks , so many countries called for classes to be suspended and 547 offices to be closed [ 52 - 53 ] . Since people will use more energy at home , energy 548 consumption would increase by 5 % - 8 % if all classes and offices were closed . 549 Although only few people were in the railway stations and airport , they play a very 550 important role in COVID - 19 transmission because people from different cities and 551 countries come into contact there . If there is an infected person in a railway station or 552 airport , their transmission chain may affect others many thousands of kilometers away 553 [ 54 ] . Even though these places meet the requirements for COVID - 19 prevention 554 based on our global optimization , it is suggested that very strict interventions should 555 be implemented to prevent SARS - CoV - 2 transmission between cities , provinces , and 556 countries . To strengthen national and even global epidemic prevention and control , the 557 R t of railway stations and airports should be kept to the minimum value of 0 . 18 by 558 mandating that all people wear masks , and implementing all NPIs shown in Figure 1 559 simultaneously . Compared to local optimization , the energy consumption will increase 560 by 85 % - 90 % , but considering the limited number of railway stations and airports in 561 a city , it will have little impact on overall urban energy consumption . 562 In this work we found that under epidemic prevention and control measures , the 563 energy consumption in summer was greater than in winter or the transition season . 564 After balancing the heat generated by human bodies indoors , the indoor and outdoor 565 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f enthalpy difference in winter is greater than that in summer . With the enhancement of 566 epidemic prevention levels , energy consumption in winter becomes gradually greater 567 than that in summer . With respect to the optimization of COVID - 19 prevention and 568 control , some indoor environments do not need to implement strict interventions , 569 therefore , when a low level of epidemic prevention and control is warranted , energy 570 consumption in summer would be greater than in winter . After global optimization , 571 Beijing saved more than 96 million kwh of electricity per day ( 9 million USD , 57 572 million CNY ) . 573 Our research has the following limitations . First , long - range airborne transmission 574 of virus particles was considered to be the main route of COVID - 19 spread . Second , 575 we used a typical design for each type of indoor environment without considering 576 their diversity . Finally , the obtained results are based on real data from Beijing . For 577 the results to be applied to other cities and countries , the local data of these places 578 should be used . 579 In the future research , more virus transmission routes such as short - range 580 airborne , large droplets , and fomite route should be considered simultaneously to 581 improve the infection risk - energy consumption model . Moreover , some experiments 582 should be designed and implemented to verify the accuracy and reliability of the 583 model . In this way , the obtained results would be much more useful for COVID - 19 584 prevention and control during the period of “dynamic clearing” . 585 586 5 . Conclusions 587 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 588 This paper established an infection risk - energy consumption model to 589 simultaneously achieve the target of COVID - 19 prevention and control ( R t < 1 ) and 590 save urban building energy . If the global optimization method is used instead of 591 ventilating the indoor environment with 3 times of the human comfortable fresh air 592 volume , the energy savings in winter , summer , and the transition season would be 593 96 % , 92 % and 94 % respectively . Comparing the global optimization with the 594 optimization for a single indoor environment , the energy savings in winter , summer , 595 and the transition season would be 72 % , 64 % , and 68 % respectively . This study 596 provides detailed and reliable strategies for saving energy while also achieving 597 adequate COVID - 19 prevention and control . The study caters to the carbon neutral 598 and carbon peak provided by Chinese President Xi , and helps to curb the spread of 599 COVID - 19 while also maintaining sustainable development of cities and societies . 600 601 Acknowledgments 602 This study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China ( grant 603 number 52108067 ) . 604 605 Conflict of Interest Statement 606 The authors declare no conflict of interest . 607 References 608 [ 1 ] World Health Organization ( WHO ) , The number of people infected by 609 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f COVID - 19 in the world , 2022 . https : / / www . who . int ( Accessed 23 February 610 2022 ) . 611 [ 2 ] H .
