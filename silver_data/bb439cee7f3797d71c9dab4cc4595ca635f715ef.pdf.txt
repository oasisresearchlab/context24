Molecular chaperones including the heat - shock protein 70 - kilodalton ( HSP70 ) family and the J - domain containing protein ( JDP ) co - chaperones maintain homeostatic balance in eukaryotic cells through regulation of the proteome . The expansive JDP family helps direct specific HSP70 functions , and yet loss of single JDP - encoding genes is widely tolerated by mammalian cells , suggesting a high degree of redundancy . By contrast , essential JDPs might carry out HSP70 - independent functions or fill cell - context dependent , highly specialized roles within the proteostasis network . Using a genetic screen of JDPs in human cancer cell lines , we found the RNA recognition motif ( RRM ) containing DNAJC17 to be pan - essential and investigated the contribution of its structural domains to biochemical and cellular function . We found that the RRM exerts an auto - inhibitory effect on the ability of DNAJC17 to allosterically activate ATP hydrolysis by HSP70 . The J - domain , but neither the RRM nor a distal C - terminal alpha helix are required to rescue cell viability after loss of endogenous DNAJC17 . Knockdown of DNAJC17 leads to relatively few conserved changes in the abundance of individual mRNAs , but instead deranges gene expression through exon skipping , primarily of genes involved in cell cycle progression . Concordant with cell viability experiments , the C - terminal portions of DNAJC17 are dispensable for restoring splicing and G2 - M progression . Overall , our findings identify essential cellular JDPs and suggest that diversification in JDP structure extends the HSP70 - JDP system to control divergent processes such as RNA splicing . Future investigations into the structural basis for auto - inhibition of the DNAJC17 J - domain and the molecular regulation of splicing by these components may provide insights on how conserved biochemical mechanisms can be programmed to fill unique , non - redundant cellular roles and broaden the scope of the proteostasis network . Introduction . Heat shock proteins are a diverse class of molecular chaperones that support the synthesis , folding , trafficking , and regulated destruction of proteins . Heat shock protein - 70 kiloDalton ( HSP70 ) proteins are an evolutionarily conserved family of chaperones that utilize ATP hydrolysis to maintain the protein homeostatic networks of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells . A class of co - chaperones , the heat shock protein - 40 kiloDaltons ( HSP40 ) or J - domain proteins ( JDP ) , have evolved alongside the HSP70 family in metazoans to enable diverse , tightly regulated cellular functions , with the basic mechanics of their allosteric interactions largely conserved from bacterial DnaJ and DnaK , respectively . 1 Central to this interaction is the J - domain , which permits acceleration of ATP hydrolysis by DnaK / HSP70 , and is the defining feature of JDP members . Nonetheless , some JDP exhibit essential J - domain independent functions . 2 This may point either to HSP70 - independent cellular activities , or result from redundancy that permits other related JDPs to compensate for loss of any single unit . 3 While the housekeeping roles of the collective ‘chaperome’ are broadly essential for cellular survival , the unique demands of different cell states can create cell type - selective chaperone dependencies . As a proof of concept , we demonstrated that genomically diverse subsets of rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS ) , the most common soft tissue cancer of childhood , harbor a selective dependence on cytosolic HSP70 to suppress ER stress responses and enable cancer progression . 4 A corollary hypothesis arising from this finding is that individual JDPs might similarly carry out functions that are essential in some contexts , but not others . Alternatively , the functions of specific JDP - HSP70 pairs may be broadly essential due to a specialization in function that cannot be compensated for by the proteostasis network . Here , we harnessed genetic screens to test the necessity of different JDPs in pediatric cancer cell lines , and carried out structure - function studies of the essential HSP70 co - chaperone DNAJC17 . Through in vitro and cellular analysis , we find that the domains required for DNAJC17 to support cell survival connect HSP70 activation with mRNA splicing , and uncover dispensable regulatory domains that fine tune this protein’s activity . Results . DNAJC17 is an essential JDP in human cancer cell lines . We sought to test the hypothesis that selective HSP70 dependence in rhabdomyosarcoma is due to the cellular effects of a unique HSP70 - JDP pair . To do so , we conducted a CRISPRi 5 screen of JDP family members in the patient derived Rh30 cell line . Cells expressing the dCas9 - KRAB transcriptional repressor were infected with a pooled lentiviral library , and deep sequencing was used to quantify sgRNA abundance immediately following puromycin selection ( t = 0 ) and after ten days in cell culture ( t = 10 ) . Across 41 different JDP , we found that guides targeting only two genes , DNAJC17 and DNAJA3 , had strong and consistent depletion ( Figure 1A ) . We next leveraged the Dependency Map ( DepMap ) project 6 to ask whether dependencies for DNAJC17 or DNAJA3 were unique to rhabdomyosarcoma . Unexpectedly , DNAJC17 stood out as the most essential JDP not just in RMS , but across all cell lines in the DepMap project ( although no unique guide RNAs are included in the DepMap dataset to interrogate DNAJB3 ) ( Figure 1B ) . Confirming the functional redundancy of the proteostasis network , only 3 out of 48 JDP - encoding genes in the DepMap had a CHRONOS score of less than - 1 , indicating essentiality . We note that the DepMap can identify selective proteostasis dependencies ; consistent with our previous work , only 167 out of 1078 cell lines had a CHRONOS dependency score of less than - 1 for the HSC70 - encoding gene HSPA8 , and it is the only HSP70 - encoding gene that shows evidence of RMS selectivity ( p < 0 . 0001 by two - way ANOVA with post - hoc Sidak’s test ; Supplementary Figure S1 ) . A similar analysis showed no enhanced RMS cell dependence on the majority of JDP - encoding genes . HSCB , a co - chaperone involved in iron - sulfur cluster biosynthesis , did show enrichment in RMS cells in the DepMap , but is still annotated as pan - essential and favored to interact specifically with the pan - essential mitochondrial HSP70 mortalin ( HSPA9 ) . 7 In the current work , we turned our attention to understanding the outlier essential role of DNAJC17 . JDPs have been historically classified based on structurally conserved elements . Members of the third class , to which DNAJC17 belongs , harbor an HSP70 - interacting DNAJ domain but have wide sequence divergence from one another aside from this feature . 8 The predicted protein structure of DNAJC17 includes a J - domain at its N - terminal end and an annotated RNA - binding RRM motif at its C - terminal end . The intervening segments of the protein are annotated as intrinsically disordered by MobiDB - Lite , 9 but harbor a putative nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) . Computational prediction of DNAJC17’s structure by AlphaFold 10 suggests that the linker region between the J - domain and RRM consists of a coiled coil , and also identifies a helical tail distal to the RRM ( Figure 2A - B ) . We sought to use these four structural elements ( J - domain , coiled - coil , RRM , and C - terminal tail ) as a starting point to better understand the essential roles of DNAJC17 in cancer cells ( Figure 2C ) . We generated FLAG - tagged deletion alleles , as well as a missense mutant allele of the conserved HPD motif in the J - domain , 11 to do so . We transiently transfected Rh30 cells with equal amounts of FLAG - tagged plasmids , and found that wildtype DNAJC17 levels consistently exceeded other mutants , with similar levels of the D J , D RRM , and D Tail constructs ( Figure 2D ) . Conversely , the D Coil mutant had extremely low expression , and was not further analyzed based on its instability for cellular assays . DNAJC17 harbors an active J - domain that is inhibited by the RRM . Prior studies of an RNA - binding DNAJC17 ortholog in yeast , Cwc23 , found that the J - domain of that protein was dispensable for its function . 12 As a first step to understand the necessity of the J - domain of DNAJC17 , we sought to confirm that it is biochemically functional . The J - domain of DNAJC17 shows a high degree of homology with the J - domain of DNAJB1 and E . coli DnaJ ( Figure 3A ) , including 47 % and 39 % identity and 78 % and 67 % positives . We purified codon - optimized wildtype DNAJC17 and tested its capacity to accelerate ATP hydrolysis of purified HSP72 , measured by malachite green measurement of free phosphate release . Surprisingly , we found that purified DNAJC17 was unable to stimulate ATP hydrolysis by HSP72 ( Figure 3B ) : ATPase activity was identical between wildtype and D J DNAJC17 . In class 2 JDPs , C - terminal domains can exert auto - inhibitory effects on J - domain function . 13 Thus , we asked whether deletion of C - terminal domains might restore the activity of DNAJC17 . Indeed , deletion of the C - terminal RRM ( though not the distal tail ) was sufficient to enable acceleration of ATP hydrolysis by HSP72 , though still quite modest compared to DNAJB1 . We conclude that the J - domain of DNAJC17 can induce allosteric activation of HSP70 , and that the RRM attenuates this productive interaction . DNAJC17 is predicted to bind RNA through its RNA recognition motif ( RRM ) . 14 , 15 However , attempts to isolate RNAs bound to either endogenous or overexpressed FLAG - tagged DNAJC17 were unsuccessful . Cells were lysed , subjected to FLAG - immunoprecipitation , and then total RNA was extracted and quantified through capillary electrophoresis . Given the described proteomic association of DNAJC17 with nucleolar splicing machinery , 16 we included the RNA - binding spliceosome component SNRPA1 as a positive control . While SNRPA1 showed clear enrichment for small RNAs , electrophoretograms of DNAJC17 pulldowns were similar to negative controls ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . The RRM may thus enable transient RNA interactions , or potentially enable protein - protein interactions . 17 The specific cellular interactors of the DNAJC17 RRM thus remain to be identified . The N - terminal J domain of DNAJC17 is essential for G2 - M progression . Having established a clear role for the J - domain and inhibitory RRM in allosteric interaction with HSP70 , we next moved to cellular systems to understand how the structural domains of DNAJC17 dictate its function in sarcoma cells . We investigated the effects of DNAJC17 loss in Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma cells , and as a parallel , the ES8 Ewing sarcoma cell line . While both cell lines represent translocation - driven pediatric mesenchymal tumors , our prior work demonstrated that ES8 cells are resistant to the effects of HSP70 inhibition , 4 and therefore we chose this as a model to interrogate potential HSP70 - independent effects of DNAJC17 . Cells expressing the dCas9 - KRAB chimera were stably transduced with the four different DNAJC17 deletion alleles of interest . Although expression levels varied , we were able to express all alleles as measured by immunoblot ( Figure 4A ) . Further , we confirmed that cellular localization of each allele remained nuclear through live - cell microscopy of GFP - tagged alleles ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . Cells were then transduced with lentiviral particles including either non - targeting control sgRNA and a GFP marker , or sgRNA targeting DNAJC17 immediately 5’ to its transcriptional start site and BFP . This guide RNA design permitted suppression of the endogenous , but not exogenous lentivirally - expressed alleles of DNAJC17 ( Figure 4A ) . Following puromycin selection , equal numbers of cells were plated and the percentage of BFP positive cells was measured over time ( Figure 4B ) . In both cellular contexts , we confirmed that while the N - terminal J - domain was essential for cellular survival , the RRM and C - terminal tail of the protein were dispensable ( Figure 4C ) . To investigate the basis for this attrition of cells , we undertook cell cycle analysis through EdU incorporation assays . Knockdown of DNAJC17 led to a marked reduction in S - phase entry in both Rh30 and ES8 cells , with evidence of G2 - M arrest ( Figure 4D ) . This could be fully reversed by expression of the D RRM and D Tail , but not the D J mutants . We conclude that DNAJC17 plays a critical role in supporting cellular survival through cell cycle progression , and that a functional J - domain is essential for this . DNAJC17 supports normal exon inclusion in splicing events . We next undertook RNASeq of cells following CRISPRi suppression of DNAJC17 to interrogate the connection between this co - chaperone and cell cycle arrest . Analysis of differentially expressed genes showed a relatively narrow overlap between Rh30 and ES8 cells , with 24 common upregulated and 2 common downregulated genes using a fold change cut - off of 2 ( Figure 5A ) . Strikingly , more than three - quarters of these transcriptional changes affected non - protein coding genes ( Table 1 ) . Interestingly , 5 / 18 of these genes were small nucleolar RNAs ; DNAJC17 has previously been implicated in mRNA splicing based on functional data 16 and proteomic association with the PRP19 complex . 18 , 19 Accordingly , we re - analyzed transcriptome data to identify derangements in splicing by mapping reads across exon boundaries . 20 Alternative splicing events were readily detectable in the DNAJC17 knockdown cells , with the majority of these events resulting in exon - skipping in both Rh30 and ES8 cells ( Figure 5B ) . RNA - Seq of cells stably expressing the D RRM mutant which showed enhanced biochemical activity and full rescue in cellular assays suppressed exon skipping events in both cell lines ( Figure 5C ) , suggesting that restoration of normal splicing was associated with rescue of viability . Gene set enrichment analysis 21 , 22 of the 24 genes commonly affected by exon skipping events identified enrichment for genes involved in the G2 - M checkpoint , further evidence of a molecular connection between splicing and the observed phenotypic consequences of DNAJC17 knockdown ( Table 2 ) . GINS1 encodes the PSF1 component of the GINS DNA replication complex , and transcripts skipping over exon 2 more than doubled upon knockdown of DNAJC17 . Interestingly , analysis of RMATS data suggested that expression of the D RRM allele was completely sufficient to rescue this effect , demonstrating that the RRM is not required for proper regulation of splicing by DNAJC17 . We validated and extended this finding from RNASeq to other alleles by semi - quantitative PCR assays . As expected , alleles that rescued RMS and EWS cells from loss of DNAJC17 showed restoration of full length GINS1 transcripts . ( Figure 5D , Supplementary Figure S4 ) . Discussion . Evolutionary diversification of the fundamental DnaJ - DnaK machinery found in prokaryotic cells has given rise to 14 different HSP70 and 41 different DNAJ family members in the human genome . Recent work has begun to systematically shed light on the individual functions of different JDP , 18 which serve not only to provide selectivity to HSP70 but to carry out their own unique activities . Here , we provide additional detail to the cellular functions of a pan - essential JDP through analysis of its component structural domains . Given the significant structural diversity present in the JDP family , one question that arises is how critical allosteric interactions with HSP70 remain in J - domain protein’s cellular functions . Such requirements may be cell - type or cell - state dependent . For instance , conditions of proteostatic stress create a requirement for the Cwc23 J - domain that is otherwise dispensable , suggesting that this protein may play either a minor or compensatory role in Ssa activation in S . cereveisae . 12 In contrast , we find that the J - domain of DNAJC17 is fundamental to its activity in human cancer cell lines , and that loss of the J - domain yields a protein that cannot support cellular survival . Thus , DNAJC17 represents a critical adaptation of the HSP70 - JDP module in mammalian cells . Interestingly , purified DNAJC17 does not exhibit HSP70 allosteric interactions , however . We instead find that this function is inhibited by the C - terminal RRM . We hypothesize that the normal regulation of DNAJC17 through RNA binding and / or protein - protein interactions induces an allosteric structural change that relieves this auto - inhibition . Although we were unable to detect RNA - binding by DNAJC17 , productive transient interactions between the RRM and RNA may indeed be the basis for this regulation . Additional structural modeling and analysis may help test this hypothesis in the future . The pan - essential nature of DNAJC17 is at odds with other proteostasis network components such as the 14 different HSP70s , many of which exhibit some degree of redundancy . Others have identified a role for DNAJC17 in regulation of splicing , and we confirm here that knockdown of DNAJC17 leads to widespread exon skipping events that are enriched in regulators of cell - cycle progression , culminating in G2 - M arrest . The molecular connection between DNAJC17 and exon exclusion within this subset of cell cycle regulators is still uncertain , but published proteomic data implicate either the PRP19 complex or components of the U5 spliceosome as being direct interactors of DNAJC17 . 16 , 19 We did not find evidence that deletion of either the J - domain or RRM alter interaction with components of these complexes ( CDC5L or SNRNP200 ) respectively ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the deletion mutants we generated might alter function but not physical interaction with the relevant splicing machinery . Together , these data support a model wherein cellular specialization of J - domain function is achieved through localization , protein - protein interactions , and well as regulatory modules ( RRM ) that may ultimately be dispensable for biochemical function . These structural modifications permit the significant contribution of protein homeostatic machinery to diverse biologic processes such as RNA splicing . In this context , protein chaperone machinery can thus contribute to RNA quality control . Future elucidation of the many roles that HSP70 - JDP pairs have evolved to fill will hopefully provide additional details of the contribution of structure to chaperone function . Methods . Cell culture . Cell lines were obtained from the COG Repository ( Rh30 , ES8 ) , or purchased from ATCC ( 293T ) , Genecopoeia ( HEK - 293 ) or Takara Bio ( Lenti - X ) . Rh30 and ES8 cells were maintained in RPM - 1640 , and 293T , HEK - 293 , and Lenti - X cells were in DMEM . All media was supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1x penicillin / streptomycin , and cells were grown in a 37 degree C incubator with 5 % CO2 . Cells were tested quarterly for mycoplasma and tested to confirm identity by STR analysis twice a year . CRISPRi screen . Lentiviral particles were generated from 293T cells transduced with pooled sgRNA libraries as described , 5 then used to infect Rh30 cells transduced with dCas9 - KRAB - BFP and sorted for BFP positivity . Flow cytometry was used to confirm an MOI of approximately 1 forty - eight hours after infection . Cells were selected in puromycin for 72 hours , an aliquot frozen for t 0 analysis , and the remainder seeded in 500 cm 2 tissue culture plates at equal density ( 8x10 6 / plate ) . Every 3 days , cells were trypsinized , pooled , counted , then re - plated at the same density to maintain 1000x coverage of each sgRNA construct . After 10 population doublings , cells were viably frozen . Deep sequencing and data analysis were performed as described . 5 Briefly , genomic DNA was extracted from t 0 and t end cells using a DNEasy Blood & Tissue kit ( Qiagen ) , digested to enrich for lentiviral integration sites , and sgRNA sequences were amplified by PCR for subsequent sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq . Reads were aligned to the sgRNA library , and fold - change from t 0 to t end was calculated . A gene - level score was then calculated as the mean of the top three scoring sgRNAs targeting a given transcript . Lentiviral transduction . Lenti - X cells were transfected with plasmids of interest , pCMVdR8 . 91 , and pMD2 . g using TransIT - LT1 transfection reagent ( Mirus ) at a 3 : 1 ratio . Six hours later , ViralBoost reagent ( Alstem ) was added at 1 : 500 . Seventy - two hours after transfection , viral particles were harvested from the supernatant , filtered through a 0 . 45 micron PES syringe , and then added to target cells with 6 µ g / mL polybrene . In twenty - four hours , selection was started with either puromycin ( shRNA or sgRNA constructs ) or hygromycin ( pLV - EF1 - Hygro constructs ) for 3 or 10 days , respectively . Plasmids and cloning . Wildtype or deletion mutants of DNAJC17 were ordered as gBlocks ( IDT ) and cloned into pLV - EF1 - Hygro using NEBuilder Master Mix ( NEB ) . Codon - optimized sequences of DNAJC17 ( WT , ∆J , ∆RRM , and ∆Tail ) and DNAJB1 were purchased as gBlocks ( IDT ) and cloned into pET28b with an N - terminal 6xHis tag followed by a TEV cleavage site . A codon - optimized sequence of HSPA1A was cloned into pET30a with a C - terminal 6xHis tag preceded by a TEV cleavage site . pET28b - TEV - C9R was purchased from AddGene . Small guide RNAs ( shown in Supplementary Table S1 ) were ordered as individual oligonucleotides ( IDT ) , heated at 95 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes in 100 mM K - acetate , 30 mM HEPES - KOH pH 7 . 4 , 2 mM MgCl 2 and let cool to room temperature to anneal , and cloned into either sgRNA - Puro - T2A - GFP or sgRNA - Puro - T2A - BFP plasmids ( a gift of Dr . Jonathan Weissman , Whitehead Institute , MA ) after digestion with BlpI and BstXI . Transient Transfections . 0 . 6 x10 6 HEK - 293 cells were plated in 6 - well plates and 24 hours later transduced with 0 . 3 micrograms of 3x - FLAG - tagged DNAJC17 constructs using Mirus transfection reagent at a 3 : 1 ratio per manufacturer’s instructions . After 3 days , cells were lysed for immunoblot analysis . Protein purification . Bacterial expression plasmids were transformed into Lucigen OverExpress C41 cells and induced with 1mM IPTG at 16°C overnight . Bacteria were then pelleted , resuspended in His - binding buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 , 750 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole , 1 mM PMSF ) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor tablets ( Roche ) , and lysed by Dounce homogenization and sonication . Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20000 g for 20 min and incubated with pre - equilibrated Ni - NTA resin ( Novagen ) at 4°C for two hours . After several washes , protein was eluted from the resin and run on a HiLoad 16 / 600 Superdex 200 column ( Cytiva ) . Eluted protein was pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Units ( MilliporeSigma ) . ATPase assays . ATPase activity was measured by Malachite Green assay ( Sigma ) . Briefly , 12 . 5 pmol of Hsp72 was incubated with 1 mM ATP in the presence of varying amounts of J - domain protein in Malachite Green Buffer ( 100mM Tris Base , 20mM KCl , 6mM MgCl2 , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 01 % Triton X - 100 ) . After two hours at 37°C , samples were diluted four - fold and mixed with Malachite Green working solution . Color was allowed to develop for 30 minutes at room temperature , and absorbance was then read at 620 nm . RNA Immunoprecipitation . RNA immunoprecipitations were carried out using the Imprint RNA Immunoprecipitation kit ( Sigma ) . Briefly , cells were lysed in Mild Lysis Buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor , ribonuclease inhibitor , and DTT on ice for 15 minutes . Lysates were cleared by centrifugation . Lysate was diluted in IP Buffer to a final volume of 500 ul , and 10 % was set aside as input . For FLAG pulldowns , the remaining lysate was incubated with FLAG M2 magnetic beads ( Sigma ) overnight . For SNRPA1 pulldowns , lysates were incubated overnight with 10 ul of anti - SNRPA1 antibody ( Novus ) , and then with Protein A Magnetic Beads ( Sigma ) for one hour . After binding , beads were washed five times with Wash Buffer . Trizol ( Fisher ) was then added directly to the beads or input aliquot . RNA and protein were sequentially precipitated , washed , and solubilized per the manufacturer’s protocol . RNA was quantified by NanoDrop and loaded abundance measured using a Pico 6000 kit and Eukaryotic Total RNA assay on a BioAnalyzer ( Agilent ) . Flow cytometric competitive fitness assays . Following puromycin selection , equal numbers of cells transduced with either GFP or BFP labeled sgRNA constructs were plated in a single well . A sample of this mixed culture was taken at the time of plating , then four days after plating , for flow cytometric analysis . The percentage of BFP + cells was normalized to the percentage present when mixed cultures were initiated . Cell cycle analysis . Cells were analyzed for cell cycle phase using a ClickIT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 kit ( Fisher ) and FxCycle PI / RNase Staining Solution ( Fisher ) followed by flow cytometry on an LSR - II ( BD ) and analysis using FlowJo . Fluorescence microscopy . For live - cell imaging , cells were plated in 6 - well dishes and transfected with mEGFP - tagged DNAJC17 or deletion mutants using TransIt - LT1 reagent at a 3 : 1 ratio ( Mirus ) . Cells were then trypsinized and replated on 4 - well chambered coverglass ( LabTek ) coated with poly - D - lysine ( Sigma Aldrich ) . The following day , cells were treated with Hoescht 33342 ( Thermo Fisher ) for at least 30 minutes and imaged on an OMX - SR microscope with TIRF 60x objective ( UCSF Center for Light Microscopy ) . Immunoblots . Cells for immunoblots were lysed in ice cold RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( Roche ) . Lysates were quantified using a DC protein assay ( Bio - Rad ) , boiled in 1x Laemmli buffer , and then run on a 4 - 16 % TGX gel . Gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and blotted from 3 - 18 hours in primary antibody , washed three times , and then incubated with HRP - conjugated secondary antibody for one hour . Blots were washed thrice , then imaged using ECL reagent ( Amersham ) on a GelDoc ( Bio - Rad ) . Blots are representative of at least three independent replicates . Quantitation was carried out by ImageJ . The following antibodies were used in immunoblots : FLAG ( Sigma # F1804 ) ; DNAJC17 ( Sigma # HPA040914 ) ; vinculin ( ProteinTech # 66305 ) ; HRP - conjugated anti - mouse IgG ( Cell Signaling # 7076V ) ; HRP - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG ( Vector Laboratories # PI - 1000 - 1 ) . RNA Sequencing . Cells plated in triplicate were lysed and total RNA collected using an RNEasy kit ( Qiagen ) , with downstream library preparation and sequencing conducted by Genewiz . Libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina following manufacturer’s instructions ( NEB , Ipswich , MA , USA ) .
