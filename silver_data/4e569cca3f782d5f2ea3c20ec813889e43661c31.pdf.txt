This research article is available in International Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning : https : / / digitalcommons . georgiasouthern . edu / ij - sotl / vol17 / iss1 / 12 University students are often called upon to learn abstract concepts , concepts with referents that cannot be detected through the senses , like anthropomorphism or aerodynamics . For example , students in literature courses may be asked to define anthropomorphism or identify instances of anthropomorphism in assigned texts . Learning abstract concepts is difficult ( Borghi et al . , 2017 ) . The most obvious difficulty in learning abstract concepts is that , by definition , there is no referent for these concepts that is available to the senses ( Borghi et al . , 2017 ) . One approach that helps learners with abstract concepts is to explain the connec - tion between abstract concepts and the physical world , with examples , metaphors , analogies , computer simulations , and / or images ( Donnelly & McDaniel , 1993 ; Duit , 1991 ; Evans & Evans , 1989 ; Falloon , 2019 ; Gentner & Asmuth , 2019 ; Halpern et al . , 1990 ; Morgan & Reichert , 1999 ; Orgill & Bodner , 2007 , 2004 ; Podolefsky & Finkelstein , 2007 ; Singh , 2010 ; Wormeli , 2002 ) . In the present study , we focus on the role of examples in learning abstract concepts . Studies have shown that students spontaneously generate examples when studying material based on abstract concepts ( Gurung et al . , 2010 ) . However , students do not always generate valid or useful examples of abstract concepts ( Zamary et al . , 2016 ) . Instructor - provided examples , however , have been shown to help learning and retention , both immediately and over a few days ( Balch , 2005 ; Rawson & Dunlosky , 2016 ; Rawson et al . , 2015 ; Zamary & Rawson , 2018 ) . One way in which exam - ples can support learning is by providing a mnemonic , allowing learners to access their knowledge quickly and easily ( Zamary & Rawson , 2018 ; see also Orgill & Bodner , 2007 , for similar results with metaphors ) . Moreover , by understanding an abstract concept through the physical world , learners can understand the rules or principles that constrain the abstract concept ( Evans & Evans , 1989 ; Halpern et al . , 1990 ; Jeppsson , Haglund , Amin , & Strömdahl , 2013 ; Singh , 2010 ) . There are , however , some potential pitfalls in learning abstract concepts through examples . Any particular example does not capture the entirety of the abstract concept . It is possible that learning an abstract concept based on a single concrete example could lead to misunderstanding . Research with learning abstract concepts based on metaphors has shown that learners sometimes do not generalize beyond the specificities of a particular meta - phor when thinking about an abstract concept ( Evans & Evans , 1989 ; Falloon , 2019 ; Jamrozik et al . , 2016 ; Morgan , 1997 ; Podolef - sky & Finkelstein , 2007 ; Spiro et al . , 1989 ; see similar reasoning in McDaniel et al . , 2018 ) . One way to address this potential limitation is to provide learners with multiple examples . By hearing multiple examples , learners could recognize the similarities across the examples and generalize to the characteristics of the abstract concept . While we know of no research testing this approach with examples , expos - ing learners to multiple metaphors leads to deeper understanding than exposing learners to one metaphor ( Arzarello , 2006 ; Harri - son & De Jong , 2005 ; Mildenhall & Sherriff , 2016 ; Ott , Brünken , Vogel & Malone , 2018 ; Spiro et al . , 1989 ) . Moreover , learners with exposure to multiple metaphors make errors related to a specific metaphor relative to learners with exposure to only one meta - phor ( Ott et al . , 2018 ; Spiro et al . , 1989 ) . The primary purpose of this study was to test whether these results generalize to exam - ples . If so , then learning an abstract concept through exposure to multiple examples should be better than learning an abstract concept through exposure to a single example . A secondary purpose of this study was to test whether there were particular examples that were better than others to support learning . In a study on analogies , biochemistry students reported that effective analogies were simple , easy to remember , and were related to highly familiar concrete concepts ( Orgill & Bodner , 2004 ) . Note that our prediction that some examples will be better than others is not mutually exclusive from the predic - tion that multiple examples will be helpful . Indeed , it is possible that exposure to multiple examples is highly effective because it increases the likelihood of exposure to a particularly useful example ( see Branigan et al . , 2012 ; Evans & Evans , 1989 , for simi - lar reasoning ) . ASSESSING LEARNING In this study , we assessed learning with three different measures : definitions , transfer to novel examples , and a self - report measure of learning . Definitions are often used to assess learners’ understanding of abstract concepts ( Gablasova , 2015 ; Johnson & Anglin , 1995 ; Rawson et al . , 2015 ; Walker , 2001 ) because definitions reveal both A Really Good Example Helps Learning About an Abstract Concept Ava Funkhouser and Elena Nicoladis University of British Columbia Received : 30 June 2021 ; Accepted : 24 September 2021 University students are often asked to learn abstract concepts .

There was , however , one particular example that was more memorable and resulted in better learning . These results have implications about how best to teach abstract concepts . 1 IJ - SoTL , Vol . 17 [ 2023 ] , No . 1 , Art . 12 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 20429 / ijsotl . 2023 . 17112 what students have understood and what they have misunder - stood . In order to define an abstract concept when presented with examples , learners must find the generalities among the specifics to understand the underlying rules or principles ( Johnson & Anglin , 1995 ) . This same kind of generalization likely underlies learners’ ability to transfer their understanding of a presented example to recognize a novel valid example of the same concept ( Goldwater et al . , 2018 ; Knoop - van Campen et al . , 2020 ) . We therefore predicted that these two objective measures of learn - ing would be positively correlated . Many studies have found no relationship between objective and subjective measures of learning ( Potter , 2013 ) , often because learners are overly confident of their own knowledge ( Zamary et al . , 2016 ) . We hypothesized that self - reported learning might unrelated to the objective measures of learning . This study In this study , we taught introductory psychology students about semiotics . We expected them to have little knowledge about semi - otics because it is not a topic typically covered in the high school curriculum . The primary purpose of this study was to test whether presenting learners with multiple examples leads to better learning than presenting them with only one example . If so , then learners should be better at defining an abstract concept and transferring to a novel example after hearing multiple examples than after a single example . A secondary purpose of this study was to test for particu - larly effective examples . We operationalized the effectiveness of examples in terms of both memorability ( i . e . , the example used when explaining the abstract concept to a friend ) and learning ( i . e . , better definitions , better transfer to novel examples , and higher self - reports of understanding ) . We hypothesized that the memo - rability would be correlated with learning success . METHOD Participants 132 participants were included in the final sample . All participants were introductory psychology students , averaging 19 . 0 years of age ( SD = 1 . 6 ) and mostly female ( 91 females , 41 males , 1 non - bi - nary ) . We asked participants to rate their degree of familiarity before the study about semiotics on a 10 - point scale ( with 1 being “extremely unfamiliar” and 10 “extremely familiar” ) . As expected , the participants reported little familiarity with semiotics ( M = 1 . 53 , SD = 2 . 26 ) . Materials Participants listened to audio recordings of the examples . These recordings feature a male describing an example of a semiotic system and range between 45 seconds to 2 minutes . The speaker is an English professor and well versed in semiotics . The profes - sor was told ahead of time that we would ask him about semi - otics but did not specifically mention ahead of time that we would be asking for examples . When obtaining the recordings , the researcher asked him to speak candidly . He had little time to prepare in order to closely mimic spontaneous speech that might occur in the context of a lecture . We reasoned that spontaneous speech would be more engaging than prepared speech . Once he had given all the examples , he agreed that all of the examples were valid examples . There were a total of five examples ( See Appendix A ) . The examples used were Morse code ( i . e . , a meaningless sound which only gains meaning within a system ) , F ashion ( i . e . , clothes can signal status and occupation , but only within a system ) , T raffic lights ( i . e . , red lights have no inherent meaning , but gain meaning within the system of traffic lights ) , Classroom ( i . e . , desks and podi - ums have no inherent meaning , but within a classroom signifies roles ) , and Chess board ( i . e . , pawns and queens have no inherent meaning , but gain meaning within the system of the game of chess ) . We used three measures to assess learning : definition , trans - fer to novel valid / invalid examples , and self - reported learning . For the definitions , the instructions were : “Define semiotics in your own words . Please be specific , try to include as much detail as possible . ” For the transfer to a novel example , the participants were asked to rate novel example on a scale of 1 ( extremely inaccurate ) to 10 ( extremely accurate ) . One of the examples was valid and the other invalid ( see Appendix B ) , with both examples using similar language to the original examples . Finally , after partic - ipants heard the example ( or examples ) , we asked them to rate their understanding on a 10 - point scale ( with 1 being “extremely poor” and 10 “extremely good” ) . In order to measure learning , we subtracted their self - rating of their prior knowledge from the present knowledge . This difference constituted the measure of self - reported learning . To assess the memorability of particular examples , we asked participants to say how they would explain semiotics / equilibrium to a friend . PROCEDURE Participants were randomly assigned to a condition : single exam - ple ( SE ) or multiple examples ( ME ) . We assigne d more participants to the SE condition ( N = 76 ) than to the ME condition ( N = 56 ) , in order to test for possible effects of particular examples . Within the ME condition , the three examples were presently in random order for each participant . Within the SE condition , the example was selected randomly for each participant and repeated three times . In the SE condition , 14 participants heard the Traffic light analogy , 17 the Fashion , 15 Morse code , 18 the Chess board , and 12 the Classroom . A research assistant showed the partici - pants into a cubicle and then fitted them with headphones . The study was presented via a Qualtrics survey . The participants were asked to define semiotics , rate their prior and present knowledge about the concept , and evaluate the valid and invalid novel exam - ples . Finally , the participants received a debriefing form and had an opportunity to ask questions . Coding The quality of the definitions was rated on a scale from 0 - 3 , with half - points assigned . The definitions had to include three separate parts , for one point each : 1 . A system of meaning and communication 2 . There is a relationship that has no inherent meaning 3 . The relationship gains meaning within the system . Here is an example of a 3 - point answer from a participant in the single perspective condition : “Semiotics refers to the rela - tionship between certain words or signals and their meanings . ” ( 1 point ) “These relationships are arbitrary , and on their own would not be related to one another” ( 1 point ) “but within a specific closed system there is a clear connection between the two . ” ( 1 point ) . A 0 point answer was “The connection between teacher 2 Good Example Helps Learning https : / / doi . org / 10 . 20429 / ijsotl . 2023 . 17112 and student , ” and a 1 . 5 point answer was “Semiotics is the idea that words or figures used to represent or describe a concept can have meaning in that specific closed system only . Based on semiotics , a figure can only gain value when it is used in a specific system of figures . ” To test on the inter - rater reliability of this coding , 20 % of the data ( i . e . , 26 participants’ definitions ) was randomly chosen for independent coding by a second coder . For these 26 participants , the second coder averaged 0 . 85 ( SD = 0 . 83 ) and the first coder 0 . 79 ( SD = 0 . 79 ) . There was no significant difference between the two reviewers’ coding on an independent - samples t - test , t ( 50 ) = 0 . 26 , p = . 80 . Moreover , the two reviewers’ scores were highly correlated , r ( 24 ) = 0 . 83 , p < . 00001 . For the analyses , we retained the first coder’s scores . To measure the memorability of particular analogies , we counted the number of participants in the ME condition who used a particular example to explain the abstract concept for a friend . To test if memorability was correlated with learning , we correlated the memorability ( from the ME condition ) with the learning measures for the participants in the SE condition . RESULTS Definitions We predicted that exposure to multiple examples ( ME ) would lead to better definitions than exposure to single examples ( SE ) . Contrary to this prediction , there was no significant difference between the definition scores in the ME condition ( M = 0 . 97 , SD = 0 . 81 ) and those in the SE condition ( M = 1 . 04 , SD = 0 . 86 ) , t ( 130 ) = 0 . 45 , p = . 66 . The lack of difference between the two conditions could have been due to the restricted scale we used to rate definitions . To test that possibility , we counted the number and percentage of participants who achieved each definition score ( summarized in Table 1 ) . We then tested if there were any differences between conditions on the numbers of participants assigned each score using a chi - square test . This analysis also revealed no significant difference between conditions , c 2 ( df = 6 , N = 132 ) = 8 . 62 , p = . 20 . In sum , we found no evidence supporting the prediction that hearing multiple examples would lead to better definitions than hearing single examples . Transfer to novel analogies by condition We predicted that exposure to ME would lead to better trans - fer to novel examples than exposure to SE . We compared the participants’ ratings of the novel valid example with the novel invalid example by condition with a 2 x 2 [ Valid / Invalid x Condi - tion ] ANOVA , with Valid / Invalid as a repeated measure . This anal - ysis showed a main effect for Valid / Invalid , F ( 1 , 129 ) = 80 . 16 , p < . 001 , η 2 = . 383 , but no main effect of Condition , F ( 1 , 129 ) = 0 . 10 , p = . 75 , η 2 = . 001 , and no interaction , F ( 1 , 129 ) = 0 . 03 , p = . 86 , η 2 < . 001 . Table 2 summarizes the results . We found no evidence supporting our prediction that exposure to ME leads to greater transfer to novel analogies than exposure to SE . Self - report of learning by condition Our third prediction was that exposure to ME would lead to higher self - reported learning than exposure to SE . A 2 x 2 [ Before / After x Condition ] ANOVA , with Before / After as a repeated measure showed a main effect for Before / After , F ( 1 , 130 ) = 322 . 61 , p < . 001 , η 2 = . 713 , but no main effect of Condition , F ( 1 , 130 ) = 0 . 37 , p = . 54 , η 2 = . 003 , and no interaction , F ( 1 , 130 ) = 0 . 04 , p = . 84 , η 2 < . 001 . Table 3 summarizes the results . There was no evidence supporting our prediction that exposure to ME leads to greater self - reported learning than exposure to SE . Correlations between measures of learning Table 4 summarizes the correlations between , definitions , ra tings of novel valid / invalid examples , and self - report of learning . As can be seen in that Table , the better definitions the participants gave of semiotics , the more they endorsed both the valid and invalid novel examples . The more they endorsed a novel valid exam - ple of semiotics , the higher their self - reported learning . These results do not strongly support our prediction that the objective measures would be highly inter - correlated and the subjective measure uncorrelated with the objective measures . Memorability Table 5 summarizes the data for each of the examples . We first tested whether there was a particularly effective example . Within the SE condition , a one - way ANOVA on the definition scores demonstrated that there was a significant main effect for example , F ( 4 , 71 ) = 8 . 11 , p < . 001 , η 2 = . 314 . LSD post - hoc tests revealed that the Traffic lights analogy was better than all the other analo - gies and the Morse code analogy was better than the Classroom Table 1 .

As for the transfer to novel examples , there was a difference between the Valid and the Invalid novel analogies , F ( 1 , 70 ) = 39 . 00 , p < . 001 , η 2 = . 358 , and a significant difference by Example , F ( 4 , 70 ) = 3 . 83 , p = . 007 , η 2 = . 180 . There was no inter - action between Analo gy and Valid / Invalid , F < 1 , ns , η 2p = . 020 . As can be seen in Table 4 , the effect of Example is that Traffic lights is higher than everything else . For self - reported learning , there was no difference by example , F < 1 , ns , η 2p = . 042 . Spearman rank - order correlations showed that memorability was highly positively correlated to average definition scores across the five examples , rho = . 821 , p = . 09 , and to ratings of the novel valid example , rho = . 975 , p = . 005 , but not to the ratings of the novel invalid example , rho = . 410 , p = . 49 , or the self - reported learning , rho = . 308 , p = . 61 . In sum , in learning about semiotics , there was a clear most effective example : Traffic lights . It was the most memorable , resulted in the highest definition scores , and led to the highest acceptance of a novel valid concept as well as a high rejection of a novel invalid concept . Furthermore , among the five exam - ples , memorability was positively related to how well partici - pants defined semiotics and how highly they accepted novel valid concepts . DISCUSSION The primary purpose of this study was to test whether exposure to multiple examples would lead to better learning than exposure to a single example when learning about the abstract concept of semiotics . Previous research has shown that exposure to multi - ple analogies supports a deeper learning of abstract concepts ( Ainsworth et al . , 2002 ; Arzarello , 2006 ; Confrey & Smith , 1994 ; Mildenhall & Sherriff , 2016 ; Ott et al . , 2018 ; Spiro et al . , 1989 ) . We found no support for our prediction . Participants who heard only one example of semiotics and participants who heard three different examples performed equivalently on definitions , transfer to novel examples , and self - reported learning . One possible reason for finding no difference between multi - ple examples and a single examples is that the learners in this study only gained very shallow knowledge of semiotics , regardless of condition . The participants’ average definition score was about one out of three , suggesting that their definitions were sufficiently describing one of the three aspects of the full definition . Similarly , while the participants gave higher endorsements of a novel valid example than a novel invalid example , their ratings of the invalid example were high ( averaging about 5 out of 10 ) . They also did not rate their own knowledge of semiotics very highly even after the study ( averaging about 5 . 5 on a scale of 10 ) . It is possible that more extensive exposure to an abstract concept is necessary for the number of examples to make a difference . Consistent with this argument , one study focused a high school teacher used multiple analogies in teaching the concept of chemical equilibrium over the course of several months ( Harrison & De Jong , 2005 ) . His students subsequently demonstrated deep and complex knowl - edge about equilibrium , including aspects of equilibrium that are challenging for university students . Future studies can be designed to test for possible advantages of presenting multiple examples of abstract concepts in the context of longer - term learning . A secondary purpose of the present study was to test whether there were some particularly effective examples ( see Evans & Evans , 1989 ; Orgill & Bodner , 2004 ) . There was clear evidence that one example was particularly effective for learning semiotics in this study . The Traffic light analogy was highly memo - rable , led to high - definition scores , high acceptance of a valid novel concept , and high rejection of an invalid novel concept . It was not entirely clear why that example was so effective . For analogies , Orgill and Bodner ( 2004 ) identified three character - istics that they thought would be highly related to effectiveness : simplicity , ease of remembering , and familiarity . While traffic lights may have been more familiar to many participants than Morse code or chess , it is not clear that the example of traffic lights was simpler or more familiar than the examples related to fashion or classrooms . One possibility is that many of the participants could have had experience with cross - cultural differences in traf - fic lights . For example , in France , yellow lights are labelled orange and in Korea , green lights are labelled blue . We did not collect data about the participants’ experience with different cultures ( or any of the relevant domains for the specific examples ) , but 48 % of the participants spoke a language other than English as their first language . Moreover , the university where the research was carried out attracts many international students . Note that this university requires a high level of English proficiency in order to be admitted so it is unlikely that English proficiency affected the results . Our explanation that many of our participants might have had some familiarity with cross - cultural differences is highly speculative and future research can address why some examples are better than others in learning . One important point to keep in mind about the present study is that we considered the participants as a group . Some studies have shown individual differences in learning through exemplars , with some students learning better through exemplars and others through abstract rules ( Foster , Rawson , & Dunlosky , 2018 ; McDaniel , Cahill , Frey , Rauch , Doele , Ruvolo , & Daschbach , 2018 ; McDaniel , Cahill , Robbins , & Wiener , 2014 ) . These individual differences have long - term implications for learning at univer - sity ( Frey , Cahill , & McDaniel , 2017 ) . Future studies could include measures of those individual differences in learning when testing how metaphors help learning abstract concepts ( see also Bjork , Dunlosky , & Kornell , 2013 , for further discussion on individual differences among learners ) .

Further research is needed to identify what makes particular examples highly effective . These results add to the literature showing that teaching abstract concepts by using examples can support learning about abstract concepts ( Balch , 2005 ; Rawson & Dunlosky , 2016 ; Rawson et al . , 2015 ; Zamary & Rawson , 2018 ) . However , instruc - tors might wish to pilot their examples before using them in the classroom ( see Orgill & Bodnerm , 2004 , for a similar suggestion for metaphors ) .

There’s two crucial interventions of modern semiotics . The first is the idea that the relationship between a w – concept and the word that we use to represent that concept is absolutely arbitrary . The second , semiotics argues that the meaning of any given word only makes sense within a closed system . ” Example 1 : Morse Code “One way to look at this would be through the example of morse code . A system of meaning in which “dot dash” means “A” and “dash dot” means N . There’s nothing inherent to the “dot dash” that should mean A , however it is only within that particular system that that , uh , figure comes to hold a certain kind of value . We know that “ dosh - - that dot dash” means A because it’s not “dash dot” , N . It’s only in that system of relationship of differences through which the “dot dash” gains meaning . ” Example 2 : Fashion “One way to look at this would be fashion , or clothing , itself which can be understood as a language or a kind of communication system . When I go to work , as a professor , I wear a jacket or a suit and I use this to try to c - - produce the meaning that I hold a certain kind of role in a professional position . However , there’s nothing inher - ent to a sports jacket that should mean professor or professional . Rather , it’s only a system of convention , just like the way that the word “tree” only by convention means those leafy things we see outside . Similarly , my jacket only means a kind of professionalism insofar as it’s not a t - shirt , or jeans , or a leather jacket , which I might wear under other circumstances to mean something else , like I’m going to a party . ” Example 3 : Classroom “One way to look at this would be through the example of a classroom , which is in itself a kind of language , or system of meaning and communication . In a classroom , there is a relationship between the desks in which students sit , and the lectern in which the professor stands . There’s nothing inherent to the lectern which should mean that it’s where a professor goes , or the desk that means where to , where students sit , but rather it’s only in their relationship that the desk gains meaning . It’s in that relationship of difference in other words , that , um , the very positions of student and professor come to make sense . Through that system , or structure , of difference . This is a semiotic insight . ” Example 4 : Chess Board “One way to look at this would be through the example of a chess board , which is also quite a lot like language . There is nothing inherent to the particular piece called a pawn that means it can only move one part on the board . It’s only within that system , called chess , that the pawn has that kind of function . It’s therefore the relationship between the ch – between the pawn and other figures : the rook , the queen , the king for example that we know what the meaning of the pawn is . It’s only through those differences that any word gains meaning . ” Example 5 : Traffic Lights “One way to look at this is through the example of a traffic light . So think for example of the colour red , which we know means “stop . ” However there’s nothing inherent to the colour red that would mean “stop , ” it’s only within that system of the traffic light that it would make sense . So , semiotics would argue that when we look at the red on the traffic light , we are actually saying “oh , it’s not green and it’s not yellow . ” It’s only that relationship between the colours in a system through which red means “stop” through which the word “tree” gains meaning . ” 7 IJ - SoTL , Vol . 17 [ 2023 ] , No . 1 , Art . 12 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 20429 / ijsotl . 2023 . 17112 APPENDIX B . VALID AND INVALID NOVEL EXAMPLES FOR TRANSFER TEST Semiotics : Valid “One way to think about semiotics is by thinking about it through nonverbal communication , like a thumbs - up . There is nothing inherent about a thumbs - up that means “good , ” however in North American culture , that is what it means . This does not mean that “thumbs - up” cannot mean something else in a different context , but its meaning is constructed through the situation that it is communication . A “thumbs - up” only gains meaning to the observer through its relationship with the culture that it exists within . ” Semiotics : Invalid “One way to think about semiotics is through the facial expression of sadness . It conveys a person’s emotions and can be transmitted throughout different contexts . There is a biological correlate to sadness , which makes the facial expression partially inherent , while other parts of it may be learned . The facial expression of sadness transmits meaning to the observer through its relationship to other facial expressions that the individual may have . ” 8 Good Example Helps Learning https : / / doi . org / 10 . 20429 / ijsotl . 2023 . 17112
