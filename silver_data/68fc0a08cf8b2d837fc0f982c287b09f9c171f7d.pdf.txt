AFM Observation of Heightened Cell Periphery of High - Grade Glioblastoma Cell Lines James R . Smith 1 & Zaynah Maherally 1 & Samantha C . Higgins 1 & Qian An 1 & Helen L . Fillmore 1 & Geoffrey J . Pilkington 1 Published online : 6 January 2016 # Springer Science + Business Media New York 2016 Abstract Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) is a highly inva - sive ( WHO grade IV ) brain tumour that has a very poor prog - nosis for patients with the condition ( median survival 14 . 2 months ) . Quantitative Imaging ( QI ) ® mode atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was used to measure the heights of the leading - edge cell peripheries , the lamellipodia , of two such cell lines ( SNB - 19 and UP - 007 ) , together with those from non - neoplastic astrocyte control cells ( CC - 2565 and SC - 1800 ) and from a low - grade ( WHO grade I ) glioma cell line ( SEBTA - 048 ) . The lamellipodia heights of the glioma cells SNB - 19 and UP - 007 were 2 . 45±0 . 59 and 1 . 57±0 . 42 μ m , respectively , which were higher than those of the CC - 2565 and SC - 1800 cells ( 1 . 03 ± 0 . 58 and 0 . 85 ± 0 . 40 μ m , respectively ; p < 0 . 0001 , except between CC - 2565 and UP - 007 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Lamellipodia height differences between the two glioma cell lines ( p < 0 . 0001 ) might be attributed to the measured differ - ence in invasive potential between these two cell lines . The equivalent lamellipodia height of the SEBTA - 048 cells was 1 . 16±0 . 48 μ m , the same as that of the astrocytes ( p > 0 . 05 ) but lower than those of the high - grade gliomas ( p < 0 . 0001 and p < 0 . 01 for SNB - 19 and UP - 007 , respectively ) . These measured heights , therefore , may provide new insights for monitoring and controlling cellular invasion in brain tumours . Keywords Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . Brain tumour . Invasion .

Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) 1 Introduction Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) is a heterogeneous and highly invasive WHO grade IV [ 1 ] brain tumour that leads to a poor prognosis for patients ( median survival 14 . 2 months , 2 - year survival 26 % , with surgery and radiotherapy with con - comitant or adjuvant chemotherapy ) [ 2 ] . The use of atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) nanoindenta - tion measurements to study the stiffness of cancer cells has received much attention [ 3 – 6 ] . We recently investigated the expression of cytoskeletal proteins and cellular stiffness of glioma cells ( SNB - 19 ) , with and without siRNA - knockdown CD44 , a cell adhesion molecule ( CAM ) long associated with gliomas [ 7 ] , and also compared these to non - neoplastic astro - cytes ( CC - 2565 , control ) [ 8 ] . Silencing CD44 SNB - 19 led to changes in cytoskeletal protein expression , making them less migratory , and AFM showed a reduction in Young ’ s modulus ( E = 0 . 56±0 . 50 kPa , nuclear regions ) relative to the parental cells ( E = 1 . 93±2 . 86 kPa ; p < 0 . 001 ) . We hypothesised that CD44 signalling via cytoskeletal proteins such as vimentin may influence the ability of glioma cells to respond to host - tumour - derived mechanical pressures . In this paper , we report on the surprisingly large heights along portions of the cell periphery leading edge , the lamellipodia [ 9 ] , of GBM cells from two cell lines , SNB - 19 and UP - 007 . Lamellipodia are Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent , sheet - like membrane protrusions at the leading edge of mi - grating cells that contain a dense network of branched actin filaments [ 10 , 11 ] . For comparisons , we have also examined the peripheries of cells from a low - grade , WHO grade I [ 1 ] , dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour ( DNET ) glioma cell line ( SEBTA - 048 ) and from two non - neoplastic astrocyte cell lines ( CC - 2565 and SC - 1800 ) . Here , we hypothesise that the heightened features of the lamellipodia might provide a new indicator of cellular invasion . In a recent paper , ‘ dynasore ’ , a * James R .

( 2016 ) 6 : 47 – 53 DOI 10 . 1007 / s12668 - 015 - 0188 - 3 dynamin inhibitor , was found to suppress lamellipodia forma - tion and invasion of U2OS human osteosarcoma cells [ 12 ] . Thus , the lamellipodia might provide an attractive target to monitor and control cellular invasion and migration in brain tumours . We have used AFM Quantitative Imaging ( QI ) ® mode ( JPK Instruments ) , a fast force mapping technique [ 13 ] , to image the cells . This technique allows the height at which the tip , measured from each approach force curve ( an array of curves constitutes each map ) , just makes contact with the sample ( set - point = 0 nN ) to be obtained . These data were subsequently used to produce contact point ( ‘ zero force ’ ) to - pography images . It was thought that this technique would lead to significantly less compression of delicate lamellipodia structures than with standard tapping mode AFM imaging . Light microscopy , including live cell imaging , and an invasion assay were used as supporting techniques . 2 Materials and Methods 2 . 1 Cell Culture Non - neoplastic foetal cerebral astrocytes ( CC - 2565 ) , passage 5 ( Lonza , UK ) , and human normal astrocytes ( SC - 1800 ) , passage 6 , derived from the cerebral cortex ( ScienCell , USA ) , were grown in astrocyte basal media ( AGM ) ( Lonza , Germany ) sup - plemented with SingleQuots ( Lonza , Germany ) and 3 % human serum ( Sigma , UK ) . The established human glioblastoma cell line , SNB - 19 ( passage 44 ) , was obtained from the DSMZ German Brain Tumour Bank ( Germany ) . Human glioblastoma cell line UP - 007 ( passage 12 ) and low - grade glioma ( WHO grade I ) cell line SEBTA - 048 ( right temporal lobe ; passage 4 ) were established in - house from biopsy - derived cultures . All gli - oma cells were cultured in Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ; Fisher , UK ) supplemented with 10 % human serum ( Sigma , UK ) and maintained at 5 % CO 2 and humidified atmo - sphere at 37 °C . All cell lines were subjected to routine myco - plasma testing utilising a kit from Lonza . Cell authentication was conducted using a microfluidic electrophoresis system incorpo - rating an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies , USA ) to analyse STR - PCR fragments from 10 human genomic loci of human cell lines [ 14 ] . 2 . 2 Live Cell Imaging Microscopy and Phase Contrast Microscopy Cells of interest were plated at 30 % confluency in a 24 - well plate and left to adhere overnight prior to each live cell exper - iment . Live cell imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M ( inverted ) microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Welwyn Garden City , Herts , UK ) contained in an incubator ( 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 , humid atmosphere ) . A ×40 objective was used and phase images were consecutively acquired typically at 5 frames s − 1 for 60 s ( Volocity software V 6 . 1 . 1 , Perkin Elmer , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Phase images were subsequently extracted from live cell movie sequences . Lower magnifica - tion phase contrast images ( ×20 objective ) were also acquired using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope ( Shinjuku , Tokyo , Japan ) ; contrast and brightness were adjusted slightly in Microsoft PowerPoint . 2 . 3 Invasion Cell invasion was assessed by the Transwell ™ - modified ] Boyden chamber technique [ 7 ] . Briefly , the Transwell ™ inserts used had 8 - μ m porosity , and polycarbonate membrane filters were contained within 24 - well plates ( Corning , UK ) and were coated with BD Matrigel ™ ( 50 μ l , 0 . 5 mg / ml ; Scientific Laboratory Supplies , Nottingham , UK ) . Platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF AB ; 10 ng / ml ) was used as a chemoattractant in the lower compartment . Invasion was allowed to occur for 6 h in an incubator ( 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 ) . A time - point analysis ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 and 12 h ) was carried out before choosing 6 h as the optimal incubation time for the invasion assay , which was further sup - ported by previous studies [ 15 ] . This provided enough time for SNB - 19 and UP - 007 cells to invade prior to proliferation based on the population doubling times calculated for these cell lines . The filters were then removed and fixed with 4 % paraformalde - hyde ( PFA ) . Non - invading cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed , and invaded cells , adherent on the lower filter surface , were characterised through alkaline phosphatase Vector Fig . 1 Light microscopy phase contrast images of GBM cells ( UP - 007 ) extracted from live cell imaging studies .

( 2016 ) 6 : 47 – 53 Red ( Vector Labs , UK ) staining . Cells positive for CD44 were thus stained red . Nuclei were blue counterstained with haematoxylin ( Dako , UK ) . Images were captured with a Zeiss Axiophot brightfield microscope using the AxioVision software ( V4 . 4 , Carl Zeiss ) with a ×20 objective . Cells were counted in five random fields , with each experiment being performed in triplicate . 2 . 4 AFM AFM measurements were performed using a NanoWizard 3 AFM ( JPK Instruments , Berlin , Germany ) mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M ( Carl Zeiss ) inverted optical microscope placed on a Halcyonics Micro 40 anti - vibration table ( Accurion , Gottingen , Germany ) . JPK AFM image analysis software ( V 5 . 1 . 13 ) was used for image acquisition and analysis . The serum growth media from a Petri dish ( glass - bottomed ) of cells of in - terest were removed ( pipette ) and replaced with ‘ imaging buffer ’ ( DMEM / F - 12 nutrient mixture ( Ham ) ( 1 : 1 ) ( 1X ) ; Gibco , Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ) . The Petri dish ( lid removed ) was then placed on an integrated Petri dish heater ( 37 °C ; JPK Instruments ) , and a ×20 objective , on the inverted microscope , was used to locate cells of interest . An ‘ arrow - shaped ’ Si canti - lever ( HQ : CSC37 / No Al ; probe ‘ C ’ , nominal length l nom = 300 ±5 μ m , width w nom = 35±3 μ m , thickness t nom = 2 . 0±0 . 5 μ m , spring constant k nom = 0 . 4 N m − 1 ; MikroMasch Europe , Wetzlar , Germany ) with an integrated tip ( R = 8 nm , h = 12 – 18 μ m ) was used for all measurements . The actual k value was measured as 0 . 2180 N m − 1 prior to imaging using the method of Hutter and Bechhoefer [ 16 ] and obtaining a force vs . distance curve on the bottom of the glass Petri dish ( in media ) in a region devoid of cells . AFM QI® mode images ( 64×64 arrays of force - distance curves ) of located cells were obtained ( approach and retract , z length = 5 . 0 μ m , approach = retract velocity 250 μ m s − 1 , approach = retract time = 20 ms ; image acquisition time = 2 . 88 min , set - point = 6 . 0 nN ) over a scan range of 100 μ m×100 μ m . AFM contact point images , representing cell topographies in the near absence of an applied load ( 0 nN ) from the tip / cantilever , were extracted from the approach force curves comprising the QI® mode images . Height data of cell lamellipodia were extracted from transects drawn across the con - tact point images ( n = 10 per cell , 3 or 4 cells per cell line ; mean and sd per cell line were reported ) . Combined height values , per cell line , were analysed using a one - way ANOVA , with a Tukey post hoc test ( * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 , * * * * p < 0 . 0001 ) in SPSS ( Version 22 ; IBM , NY , USA ) . Contact point images were filtered using a median pass filter . 3 Results and Discussion 3 . 1 Live Cell Imaging Prior to the AFM studies , an overview of the cellular morphol - ogy and presence of lamellipodia were investigated . Lamellipodia were present at the leading edge of a number of migrating cells , as confirmed by live cell imaging ( those of Fig . 2 Phase contrast micrographs showing the morphology of non - neoplastic astrocytes : a CC - 2565 and b SC - 1800 cells .

( 2016 ) 6 : 47 – 53 49 UP - 007 cells are shown in Fig . 1 ) . These structures could be seen as bright - shaded , ruffled edges on generally semi - circular protruded regions . 3 . 2 Light Microscopy CC - 2565 cells at 80 % confluence showed an elongated and stellate morphology ( Fig . 2a ) . Lamellipodia could be observed at the leading edge of a number of these cells . SC - 1800 cells at 60 % confluence showed a polygonal morphology with thin , elongated intercommunicating processes at either end of the cells ( Fig . 2b ) . Lamellipodia of similar appearance to those of the CC - 2565 cells were observed . SNB - 19 cells , at 30 % confluence , showed small , predominantly stellate morphologies , with some flattened , irregular shapes with tiny , slender processes ( Fig . 3a ) . This cell line had the greatest number of lamellipodia , possibly indicative of higher motility and / or invasion [ 12 ] . UP - 007 cells , at 40 % confluence , revealed their heterogeneous nature , with many processes at their ends and with some short , more rounded morphologies with predominantly fusiform cells ( Fig . 3b ) . Fig . 6 Number of SNB - 19 and UP - 007 cells that had invaded through the Transwell ™ inserts . SNB - 19 cells were significantly more invasive than UP - 007 cells ( * p < 0 . 05 ) . The graph is representative of the results obtained by repeating the study three times in triplicate ; number of SNB - 19 cells invaded = 140 , number of UP - 007 cells invaded = 100 Fig . 7 AFM contact point images extracted from QI® mode images of non - neoplastic astrocytes : a – c CC - 2565 cells and d – f SC - 1800 cells 50 BioNanoSci . ( 2016 ) 6 : 47 – 53 Similar lamellipodia structures were observed , although to a much reduced frequency compared to their SNB - 19 counterparts . The low - grade SEBTA - 048 cell line , at 70 % confluence , showed rather fat , end - feet processes ; again , lamellipodia of similar appearance to those seen above were present ( Fig . 4 ) . 3 . 3 Invasion To investigate whether the difference in the number of lamellipodia observed in SNB - 19 and UP - 007 cells might be indicative of their invasive potential , an invasion assay was performed . The findings showed more SNB - 19 cells positive for CD44 ( red ) had invaded to the lower side of the membrane compared to UP - 007 ( Fig . 5 ) . SNB - 19 cells showed a homo - geneous morphology with shorter fat processes . These results were reflected in the quantitative analysis , showing SNB - 19 cells to be more invasive than those of UP - 007 ( p < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 6 ) . 3 . 4 AFM Measurements Cells for AFM imaging were selected , using the inverted micro - scope , with the following criteria : that they were not joined to other cells , they exhibited lamellipodia and they were free from obvious artefacts . Phase contrast images were obtained for each cell imaged , although are not shown . AFM contact point images of non - neoplastic astrocyte cell lines ( CC - 2565 and SC - 1800 ; Fig . 7 ) generally revealed rounded cells , with raised nuclei re - gions but with little or no apparent lamellipodia despite these features being present in the phase contrast images . Transects drawn across the cells enabled the lamellipodia heights to be calculated ( Fig . 8 shows an example ) . The combined values for CC - 2565 and SC - 1800 cell lines were 1 . 03±0 . 58 and 0 . 85 ±0 . 40 μ m , respectively . In contrast , many of the glioma cells , from both SNB - 19 and UP - 007 cell lines , had obvious lamellipodia structures present in the AFM contact point images ; they were particularly prominent in the SNB - 19 cells ( Fig . 9 ) . The lamellipodia heights were 2 . 45±0 . 59 and 1 . 57±0 . 42 μ m , respectively . These heights were also measured for low - grade Fig . 8 Transect line denoting the location at which lamellipodia height data are extracted from AFM contact point images . The example shows an SC - 1800 cell ( same as Fig . 7e ) Fig . 9 AFM contact point images extracted from QI® mode images of GBM cells : a – d SNB - 19 cells and e – h UP - 007 cells BioNanoSci . ( 2016 ) 6 : 47 – 53 51 glioma cells ( SEBTA - 048 ) to investigate whether they decreased in magnitude ( Fig . 10 ) . The lamellipodia heights here were 1 . 16 ±0 . 48 μ m , more comparable to those of the astrocytes . A statistical comparison of the lamellipodia heights for the different cell lines is summarised in Fig . 11 . The two astrocyte cell lines showed no difference in periphery cell heights ( p > 0 . 05 ) and had the lowest values . The lamellipodia heights in SNB - 19 and UP - 007 cells were both greater than those of the astrocytes ( p < 0 . 0001 , except between CC - 2565 and UP - 007 , p < 0 . 001 ) . These results suggest that some elaborate concentra - tion of cytoskeletal structures , probably F - actin , may explain the large height values of the lamellipodia . Interestingly , a difference in lamellipodia heights was noted between the two types of glio - blastoma cell lines ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , possibly reflecting the degree of invasive potential between these two cell lines as evidenced in the invasion assay . The low - grade glioma cell line had lamellipodia heights similar to those of the astrocytes ( both cell types ; p > 0 . 05 ) , although were less than those of the gliomas ( p < 0 . 0001 and p < 0 . 01 for SNB - 19 and UP - 007 , respectively ) . The low - grade SEBTA - 048 cells would be expected to be less invasive than the WHO grade IV gliomas , although this was not investigated . To our knowledge , these are the first AFM images that show a heightened edge at cell peripheries . Numerous AFM studies show a cell topography to slope away from the nucleus gradually to the cell margin and do not report a raised topography at cell edges , both for glioma cells [ 17 – 20 ] and other cells ( cancerous and non - cancerous ) [ 21 – 23 ] . Staining of F - actin , intermediate filament and microtubules in these cells shows fluorescence not only at the cell periphery but also throughout the cytoplasm [ 7 ] ( although largely around the nuclear regions , in the case of vimentin [ 8 ] . Therefore , some elaborate concentration of cyto - skeletal structures , possibly F - actin , may explain the large height values of the lamellipodia . The size of the heightened lamellipodia in high - grade glioma cells over astrocytes and low - grade glioma cells may provide new insights into controlling cellular invasion . 4 Conclusions For the first time , AFM has been used to measure the lamellipodia heights of glioma cells and , for high - grade cells , these have been found to be higher than non - neoplastic Fig . 10 a – d AFM contact point images extracted from QI® mode images of low - grade ( WHO grade I ) glioma cells Fig . 11 Lamellipodia heights measured from AFM contact point images of the various cell lines : CC - 2565 and SC - 1800 , 3 cells per cell line ; SNB - 19 , UP - 007 and SEBTA - 048 , 4 cells per cell line ( 10 measurements per cell ) . * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 , * * * * p < 0 . 0001 .

( 2016 ) 6 : 47 – 53 astrocyte control cells . Equivalent heights of low - grade glio - ma cells were found to be identical to those of the astrocytes and less than those of the GBMs , although future studies should incorporate more low - grade glioma cell lines . These results suggest that lamellipodia height could be used to mon - itor and control cell invasion in brain tumours . Acknowledgments We thank Drs .
