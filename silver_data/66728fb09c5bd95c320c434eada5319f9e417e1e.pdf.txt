Contact tracing in the 27 United States was conducted during the pre - Omicron phase of the ongoing COVID - 19 28 pandemic . This tracing relied on voluntary reporting and responses , often using rapid antigen 29 tests ( with a high false negative rate ) due to lack of accessibility to PCR tests . These limitations , 30 combined with SARS - CoV - 2’s propensity for asymptomatic transmission , raise the question 31 “how reliable was contact tracing for COVID - 19 in the United States” ? We answered this 32 question using a Markov model to examine the efficiency with which transmission could be 33 detected based on the design and response rates of contact tracing studies in the United States . 34 Our results suggest that contact tracing protocols in the U . S . are unlikely to have identified 35 more than 1 . 65 % ( 95 % uncertainty interval : 1 . 62 % - 1 . 68 % ) of transmission events with PCR 36 testing and 0 . 88 % ( 95 % uncertainty interval 0 . 86 % - 0 . 89 % ) with rapid antigen testing . When 37 considering an optimal scenario , based on compliance rates in East Asia with PCR testing , this 38 increases to 62 . 7 % ( 95 % uncertainty interval : 62 . 6 % - 62 . 8 % ) . These findings highlight the 39 limitations in interpretability for studies of SARS - CoV - 2 disease spread based on U . S . contact 40 tracing and underscore the vulnerability of the population to future disease outbreaks , for 41 SARS - CoV - 2 and other pathogens . 42 43 44 45 46 47 .

Overlapping with , but distinct from the medical establishment and the 53 biopharmaceutical industry , modern public health organizations have sought to control disease 54 using nonpharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) . 55 56 Contact tracing is a cornerstone of the public - health response , particularly with emergent 57 pathogens and nascent disease outbreaks [ 1 ] . Effective contact tracing facilitates estimates of 58 epidemiological parameters describing disease spread . In the current COVID - 19 pandemic , 59 rigorous early studies relying on contact tracing revealed key epidemiological features of SARS - 60 CoV - 2 such as asymptomatic transmission [ 2 , 3 ] , superspreading [ 4 ] , and aerosol transmission 61 [ 5 – 9 ] . This provided a basis for projecting the future course of the outbreak and designing a 62 public health response . 63 64 Effective contact tracing is also critical for limiting onward spread through the deployment of 65 test - and - trace and isolation protocols . Many Asia - Pacific countries effectively limited SARS - CoV - 66 2 community spread for the first two years of the pandemic , relying on contact tracing with 67 isolation of contacts , including strict testing and isolation efforts at their borders . For example , 68 South Korea used methods such as tracking credit card transactions and using closed circuit 69 televisions to link contacts together [ 10 ] . In China , specifically Hubei , suspected contacts were 70 placed under monitored house arrest throughout their quarantine period [ 11 ] . This strategy 71 permitted high levels of withing country contact and mobility while keeping case counts low 72 [ 12 – 18 ] . 73 74 In the U . S . , contact tracing was primarily performed in the pre - Omicron era , and largely 75 abandoned in early 2022 [ 19 ] . It has been widely recognized that contact tracing in the U . S . has 76 .

Part of the challenge has been that the process varied 77 from state to state and relied on individual initiative and access to testing [ 19 ] . This meant that 78 an individual typically must be symptomatic , voluntarily seek testing , and have their positive 79 result reported to initiate contact tracing [ 21 ] . Public health officials initiated an investigation 80 by asking the index case to identify their contacts , who in turn would be interviewed . The 81 exposed contacts were monitored for symptoms and could choose to test for SARS - CoV - 2 five 82 days after exposure . If positive , the contact ( now a secondary case ) would be asked to name 83 their contacts . 84 85 The process was largely voluntary , allowing for selection bias and many missed transmission 86 chains . There was often no system for identifying close contacts whom the index case did not 87 know personally . Many published papers noted that many named contacts were not 88 successfully traced [ 22 – 24 ] and not all symptomatic contacts were willing to undergo testing 89 [ 25 ] . A systematic surveillance - based cross - sectional study in the U . S . showed that 2 out of 3 90 index cases of COVID - 19 were either not reached by tracers or declined to share contacts . Only 91 70 % of named contacts agreed to be interviewed , and only 50 % of those contacts were 92 monitored , leading to an average of less than one contact per index case being monitored [ 26 ] . 93 Additionally , the CDC - recommended 15 minutes of contact within six feet over a 24 - hour 94 period was somewhat arbitrary and never updated , even as evidence emerged indicating that 95 COVID - 19 could be transmitted through brief interactions . 96 97 The implications of these limitations in contact tracing are significant . The relatively high 98 reproductive number for SARS - CoV - 2 [ 27 ] would suggest that many transmission chains 99 generated from a single index case went undetected . Additionally , asymptomatic transmission 100 and superspreading behavior would also impact the efficacy of contact tracing for infection 101 control and the generalizability of inferences made about transmission dynamics [ 28 , 29 ] . 102 103 In keeping with this voluntary and symptom - gated approach to contact tracing , there are many 104 examples of minimally observed onward transmission in settings where transmission would be 105 .

This includes studies involving children with strong implications for policies related to 106 schools . The results of studies investigating children and COVID - 19 transmission have 107 documented limited forward transmission , but this is often in context of significant mitigation 108 strategies being in place or incomplete contact tracing [ 30 – 32 ] . During the initial omicron surge , 109 when contact tracing was limited , schools struggled to remain open , reported high absenteeism 110 rates , and in some cases , relied on the national guard to teach courses and due to incomplete 111 contact tracing it was unclear what role children in schools played in transmission [ 33 , 34 ] . In 112 one another case , two COVID - 19 positive hairdressers in Missouri saw 139 clients over a ten - 113 day period , with no reported onward transmission [ 24 ] . Notably , of the exposed clients , only 114 ~ 75 % ( n = 104 ) responded to contact tracers’ requests for interviews , and only ~ 50 % ( n = 67 ) 115 agreed to be tested . Biases in willingness to respond to interviews or agree to testing may have 116 concealed many onward transmission events . 117 118 Another example , demonstrated the challenges in identifying both primary and secondary 119 infections , was the Sturgis motorcycle rally in August 2020 . Following this 10 - day event in 120 Meade County , South Dakota ( attended by approximately 460 , 000 persons [ 35 ] without [ 36 – 121 38 ] any mask - wearing requirements or other mitigating policies [ 39 ] ) , there was a wave of 122 COVID - 19 cases in Meade County and South Dakota . The counties outside of South Dakota that 123 contributed the highest inflows of rally attendees experienced a 6 . 4 - 12 . 5 % increase in COVID - 124 19 cases relative to counties without inflows [ 40 ] . Despite evidence of population - level changes 125 in COVID - 19 case counts following the rally , the CDC and Minnesota Department of Health were 126 able to identify only 21 person - to - person transmission events [ 41 ] . Out of the 86 positive cases , 127 only 41 reported being in close contact ( defined as being within 6 feet of another person for 128 ≥15 minutes ) with other people , and they reported an average of 2 . 5 close contacts . Both 129 statistics are implausible for a 10 - day motorcycle rally featuring indoor dining and concerts [ 42 – 130 44 ] . The CDC’s report does not specify how many of the 102 secondary contacts were tested , 131 consistent with other U . S . contact - tracing studies [ 45 , 46 ] . 132 133 .

S . during the early part of the pandemic raise the question “what was the efficiency of 135 contact tracing , as it was implemented in the U . S . ” ? We answered this question using Markov 136 Chain modeling to synthesize data from multiple sources of information on testing and contact 137 tracing completeness to estimate the efficiency with which onward transmission could be 138 detected . Our model - based approach sought to quantify two metrics of performance for 139 contact tracing : 1 ) the percentage of all transmission pairs identified in a disease 140 cluster / outbreak , and 2 ) the percentage of onward transmission events identified from a 141 known index case . These metrics correspond broadly to the two contact - tracing scenarios 142 described above , the Sturgis motorcycle rally study ( seeking all transmission pairs ) and the 143 Missouri hairdressers ( seeking onward transmission from a known index case ) . Our results 144 suggest that , as may be expected , contact tracing protocols in the United States are unlikely to 145 have identified more than a vanishingly small fraction of transmission events . We contrast this 146 with a similar model run that incorporates data from Asian countries with more comprehensive 147 contact tracing protocols in place , which yields a larger fraction of identified transmission 148 events . 149 150 Methods 151 152 Model 153 We created a Markov Model to represent the sequence of events in contact tracing depicted in 154 Figure 1 . The model captures the steps in contact tracing beginning with identifying a primary 155 infectious individual through testing and then engaging that person in contact tracing by 156 accurately identifying their contacts . The final steps of the model details engaging the infected 157 contact and completing testing . We focus on estimating the probability of identifying infected 158 contacts only . We parameterize the model steps through literature review . We capture 159 uncertainty in the transition parameters by sampling over a literature - informed uncertainty 160 range of the parameters 10 , 000 times . When no data was available on a parameter value , we 161 sweep over the range of [ 0 , 1 ] . 162 .

We used the search term “ ( covid 19 or covid - 19 or covid19 ) AND ( case investigation 166 or contact tracing ) AND ( united states or US ) ” on PubMed to inform parameters that define the 167 likelihood of individuals naming their close contacts and of those contacts responding to a 168 contact tracing encounter and being tested . We collected data from contact tracing 169 investigations that reported the proportion of positive cases that named contacts , the 170 proportion of named contacts reached , the proportion of contacts that cooperated with 171 tracers , and / or the proportion of contacts tested . 172 173 We also parameterized our model to represent a setting where stringent contact tracing was 174 implemented . For this , we derived estimates from Taiwan and South Korea , which had rigorous 175 contact tracing protocols during the initial phase of the pandemic using the search terms ‘ ( covid 176 19 or covid - 19 or covid19 ) AND ( case investigation or contact tracing ) AND ( taiwan ) ’ and ‘ ( covid 177 19 or covid - 19 or covid19 ) AND ( case investigation or contact tracing ) AND ( korea or south 178 korea ) ’ . We run the model separately for RAT and PCR tests . 179 180 The model can be divided into two distinct categories of parameters that contribute to the 181 overall effectiveness of contact tracing : 1 ) efficiency of testing and 2 ) efficiency of contact 182 tracing . Efficiency of testing includes the proportion of symptomatic people receiving testing , 183 test sensitivity ( RAT or PCR ) [ 47 , 48 ] , and the proportion of contacts tested . Efficiency of contact 184 tracing aggregates the probabilities that tracers contact a positive index case , a positive index 185 case names contacts , and named contacts are traced . Both aggregate parameters take values 186 between [ 0 , 1 ] . We plot all possible combinations of these parameters on a heatmap and 187 identify the estimates obtained for the U . S . - based and ideal scenarios . 188 189 Code Availability . 190 .

S . studies yielded 1 , 355 papers . Of these , the first 350 were reviewed 197 to represent a random sample of the total papers found , as our goal was to conduct a 198 representative and not comprehensive literature review . We excluded 325 papers that did not 199 contain data relevant to the parameters required for our model , leaving twenty - five papers 200 with information on contact tracing parameters . When multiple papers had values for the same 201 parameter , for instance the probability of a case naming contacts , we assumed that the true 202 value was uniformly distributed in the range of the reported values across the papers . All 203 parameter values are shown in Table 1 ; sources of the parameters are shown in Tables S1 - S6 . 204 We were unable to identify precise parameter estimates for the probability of a symptomatic 205 person receiving testing and assume a uniform distribution over [ 0 , 1 ] . 206 207 We reviewed 225 papers from South Korea and Taiwan . However , we were unable to 208 find studies quantifying contact tracing parameters related to the completeness of tracing . This 209 appeared to be due to a much more comprehensive approach to contact tracing in these 210 countries , negating the need to report on these parameters since it was assumed that reporting 211 was nearly complete . For example , South Korea used traditional shoe - leather epidemiology 212 along with large databases ( global positioning system , credit card transactions , and closed - 213 circuit television ) [ 10 ] and in one study of 5 , 706 index cases an average of 9 . 9 contacts per 214 index case were reported [ 10 ] . Taiwan similarly reported an average of 27 . 61 contacts per index 215 case [ 49 ] . This contrasts with the US where the average number of non - household contacts 216 reported in a large study was one for every three index cases [ 50 ] . Therefore , we hypothesized 217 a realistic range of [ 0 . 9 , 1 . 0 ] for all parameters not associated with testing sensitivity in our 218 ideal model setting . 219 .

S . when RAT are the primary testing modality . More specifically , we 227 estimate a 20 . 2 % chance of identifying a positive index case , a 20 . 0 % chance of identifying 228 contacts given that the index case has been identified , and a 21 . 2 % chance of identifying 229 positive secondary cases given the index cases and contacts were identified . Using more 230 sensitive , but less available , PCR tests , we estimate a 1 . 65 % ( 95 % uncertainty range : 1 . 62 % - 231 1 . 68 % ) chance of identifying a transmission pair ( Figure 2 , Table 2 ) . Our model estimates a 232 27 . 7 % chance of identifying a positive index case , a 19 . 8 % chance of identifying contacts given 233 that the index case has been identified , and a 29 . 2 % chance of identifying positive cases given 234 that the index cases and its contacts were correctly identified . By contrast , when we use an 235 idealized scenario , based on data from East Asia , we estimate a 62 . 7 % ( 95 % uncertainty range : 236 62 . 6 % - 62 . 8 % ) chance of identifying a given transmission pair when using PCR testing and 33 . 5 % 237 ( 95 % uncertainty range : 33 . 4 % - 33 . 6 % ) when using RAT ( Figure 2 , Table 2 ) . 238 239 When an index case has been identified , we remove the associated model steps . In our U . S . 240 based example , we estimate a 2 . 62 % ( 95 % uncertainty interval : 2 . 59 % - 2 . 65 % ) and 3 . 62 % ( 95 % 241 uncertainty interval : 3 . 58 % - 3 . 66 % ) chance of identifying a positive contact of a known index 242 case using RAT and PCR testing , respectively . In our idealized tracing setting , these increase to 243 53 . 3 % ( 95 % uncertainty interval : 53 . 2 % - 53 . 4 % ) for RAT and 73 . 3 % ( 95 % uncertainty interval : 244 73 . 2 % - 73 . 4 % ) for PCR testing . 245 246 247 Discussion 248 .

The virus still exerts an enormous mortality and morbidity burden 250 worldwide , with nearly 7 million reported deaths thus far [ 51 ] . Underlying this is the systematic 251 failure of contact tracing , which was abandoned by most states in the United States by early 252 2022 [ 19 ] and contraindicated in CDC guidance for communities with “sustained ongoing 253 transmission” of COVID - 19 [ 21 ] . The Lancet Commission report on COVID - 19 [ 52 ] and several 254 reviews [ 20 , 53 , 54 ] have highlighted this shortcoming in pandemic response . 255 256 Our work takes this a step further by quantifying the extent to which contact tracing failed to 257 identify transmission events in the U . S . and in an idealized setting base on East Asian data . Our 258 demonstrate that the voluntary steps in contact tracing , i . e . seeking testing and interacting with 259 contact tracers , reduced the efficiency dramatically , with fewer than 2 % of transmission events 260 identified compared to 62 . 7 % in a setting where testing and compliance with tracing was 261 higher . 262 263 Contact tracing formed the basis of modern epidemiological practice , dating back to the 264 investigation of the 1854 Broad Street Cholera outbreak in Britain [ 55 ] that led to both a 265 mechanistic understanding of cholera transmission [ 56 ] and successful control of the outbreak . 266 A more recent example of highly successful and proactive contact tracing by public health 267 authorities was the effective suppression of monkeypox in the Western US in 2003 [ 57 ] . 268 Notably , during the current pandemic , many other countries ( such as China , Japan , South 269 Korea , Taiwan , Vietnam and Singapore ) were successful at implementing contact tracing in the 270 first two years of the pandemic [ 14 – 18 ] . 271 272 The impact of poor contact tracing in the U . S . has undermined our understanding of the 273 transmission potential of SARS - CoV - 2 . For example , the argument that schools do not 274 contribute to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission was based in part on the lack of detection of 275 transmission chains in a school setting . Numerous publications showed a lack of contact - traced 276 chains of transmission in a school setting [ 58 – 62 ] , while in effect lacking a positive control for 277 .

It is now clear that SARS - CoV - 2 is 278 readily transmitted in schools [ 64 – 72 ] , particularly when robust mitigation measures are not in 279 place [ 73 , 74 ] . Indeed , dramatic increases in case detection rates have been observed in studies 280 that relied on surveillance testing , rather than contact tracing [ 70 ] . Additionally , this led to the 281 conclusion that the most common source of transmission was gatherings in the home , but it is 282 unclear if this is a consequence of household contacts being easiest to identify or a result of 283 many transmission studies being conducted in settings with strict shut downs , where 284 households were one of the few places where transmission could occur [ 75 ] . Also , reports from 285 the West have pointed to a lack of detected transmission chains in air travel [ 76 – 78 ] . These 286 reports are contradicted by careful contact tracing studies from other countries , which have 287 clearly demonstrated person - to - person transmission in flight [ 79 – 81 ] , even when robust 288 mitigation measures were in place [ 82 ] . 289 290 Our work has several limitations . We have assumed instantaneous contact tracing , ignoring the 291 impact of tracing delays on infection control which has a significant impact on contact tracing 292 effectiveness against transmission [ 83 , 84 ] due to short incubation period of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 85 ] . 293 Instead , our estimates for contact tracing effectiveness apply to the informativeness of contact 294 tracing studies , and they form an upper bound for the effectiveness of contact tracing as a 295 transmission prevention measure . We do not account for asymptomatic transmission , again 296 making our estimates an upper bound . The percent of asymptomatic COVID - 19 cases is 297 estimated to be anywhere between 1 . 6 % and 56 . 5 % [ 90 – 96 ] , with a these cases having a 298 relative reduced infectiousness of 0 to 62 % [ 90 - 97 ] . This would mean our estimated 1 . 65 % of 299 transmission pairs identified with PCR testing could be as low as 0 . 9 % , assuming no 300 asymptomatic index cases are identified . We also have not accounted for superspreading , 301 which has been estimated to be a significant feature in COVID - 19 transmission [ 94 – 96 ] . This 302 implies that missing a superspreading index case would have tremendous impact on 303 downstream contact tracing efforts and that there is significant stochasticity [ 97 ] . We only 304 consider the probability of identifying infected contacts , but it is ideal to also identify 305 uninfected contacts accurately . Finally , we estimate the probability of naming an infected 306 .

This means that our final estimated probabilities are 308 upper bounds of the true values . Despite representing an upper bound , our contact tracing 309 estimates suggest that U . S . contact tracing studies fail to identify the vast majority of 310 transmission pairs and onward transmission events . This severely limits the inferences that can 311 be drawn from such studies . 312 313 Our work points to several key lessons for future public health efforts . First , compliance is a key 314 driver of contact tracing effectiveness . Methods to improve compliance will be crucial for future 315 contact tracing efforts - whether using technological approaches ( such as mobile phone or 316 surveillance - camera based tracing ) or by making changes to the legal framework around public 317 health efforts ( see Supplementary Information S2 for a more on this topic ) . 318 319 Second , there is a pressing need for innovation , to develop contact tracing methodologies that 320 are more resistant to noncompliance . One such approach may be backward contact tracing , 321 which seeks to identify who infected the detected case . Here when contact tracing is executed 322 backward to identify the source of infection ( parent ) , the more offspring ( infections ) a parent 323 has produced , the more frequently the parent shows up as a contact . Model - based analysis 324 suggests that a backwards contact tracing approach does not require sampling a network at 325 such a large scale as forward tracing [ 98 , 99 ] to understand transmission dynamics , and 326 addresses the problem of low compliance . This approach has been proposed by others for 327 COVID - 19 [ 100 – 102 ] , and has been empirically shown to be effective , particularly in identifying 328 superspreading events [ 103 ] , however this is unlikely to be as helpful in reducing transmission . 329 330 Third , public health responses to future outbreaks must include educate the public about 331 behaviors with health outcomes , including creating a normative framework around contact 332 tracing compliance . Consistent messaging about limiting transmission and contact tracing are 333 key as has been noted by the Lancet Commission [ 52 ] , among others [ 104 , 105 ] .

During the HIV epidemic , 336 contact tracers emphasized the index case’s personal responsibility towards the health of their 337 sexual partners [ 1 ] . It also includes addressing misinformation , which led many to believe that 338 COVID - 19 was a “hoax” [ 108 ] and public health measures were overreactions [ 109 ] . 339 340 Finally , we have shown that testing availability and accuracy create a critical gap in contact 341 tracing efforts . Considering only the steps for testing accuracy and cases / contacts receiving 342 testing in our model we find that only 12 . 4 % of possible cases could be identified with RAT , the 343 most available testing modality . To effectively manage future outbreaks , tests need to be 344 sensitive , provide rapid results , and be readily available . 345 346 The work presented here adds to the growing body of literature [ 26 , 110 , 111 ] highlighting the 347 poor performance of contact tracing in the West during the ongoing pandemic and suggests 348 practical fixes for this problem , as we have described . In its absence , public health is forced to 349 rely on population - wide measures for disease spread and will not be able to fine - tune its 350 responses to match the situation . If we are to improve our response to the current crisis , or to 351 others in the future , we must improve our ability to deliver this key function . 352 353 .

Impact of contact tracing and testing on the probability of identifying a positive 379 contact of an infected individual with COVID - 19 . Quality of testing refers to parts of the 380 process relating to testing and aggregates the following probabilities : symptomatic people 381 receiving testing , symptomatic index cases receive true positive test result ( i . e . test sensitivity ) , 382 contacts receive testing , contacts receive a true positive test result . Quality of contact tracing 383 aggregates the probability of : tracers contact a positive index case , a positive index case names 384 contacts , and tracers contact the contacts of the index case . This shows that if testing and 385 contact tracing are done perfectly , we can expect to identify all contacts of infected individuals 386 ( illustrated through the colors of the heat map ) . The blue circles correspond to our simulations 387 using RAT while the white circles correspond to PCR testing use . The two circles in the lower left 388 hand corner correspond to our United States estimates while the two in the upper half 389 correspond to our simulations using estimates from South Korea and Taiwan , where there was 390 stricter contact tracing . 391 392 8 t .

Illustration of Model results . We assume a hypothetical population of 1 , 000 infected 395 people in a community with 5 unique infected contacts ( no shared contacts ) . The figure 396 depicts the results of our model , tracking the number of losses at each step . We split the 397 tracking of ‘cases’ by first identifying how many index cases were identified . Then , with 398 that information , we moved to correctly identifying positive contacts of those index 399 cases . This example shows that if we had 1 , 000 people who infected 5 people each ( 5000 400 total infected contacts ) and assuming the use of RAT , we would expect to correctly 401 identify about 43 of the 5000 secondary cases . 402 403 404 .
