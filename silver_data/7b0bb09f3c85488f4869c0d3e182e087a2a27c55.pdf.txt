Bonifacino Dynamins are 100 - kDa GTPases that are essential for clathrin - coated vesicle formation during receptor - mediated endocytosis . To date , three different dynamin genes have been identiﬁed , with each gene expressing at least four different alternatively spliced forms . Currently , it is unclear whether these different dynamin gene products perform distinct or redundant cellular functions . Therefore , the focus of this study was to identify additional spliced variants of dynamin from rat tissues and to deﬁne the distribution of the dynamin family members in a cultured rat epithelial cell model ( Clone 9 cells ) . After long - distance reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR of mRNA from different rat tissues , the full - length cDNAs encoding the different dynamin isoforms were sequenced and re - vealed four additional spliced variants for dynamin I and nine for dynamin III . Thus , in rat tissues there are a total of at least 25 different mRNAs produced from the three dynamin genes . Subsequently , we generated stably transfected Clone 9 cells expressing full - length cDNAs of six different spliced forms tagged with green ﬂuorescent protein . Confocal or ﬂuorescence microscopy of these transfected cells revealed that many of the dynamin proteins associate with distinct membrane compartments , which include clath - rin - coated pits at the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus , and several undeﬁned vesicle populations . These results indicate that the dynamin family is more extensive than was originally predicted and suggest that the different dynamin proteins are localized to distinct cytoplasmic or membrane compartments . INTRODUCTION Dynamin is a large GTPase that was ﬁrst identiﬁed from mammalian brain based on its ability to bind microtubules in a nucleotide - dependent manner ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) . Dynamin’s GTPase can be stimulated in vitro through interaction with effector molecules at its proline - rich C - terminal domain . In - sights into dynamin function emerged by demonstrat - ing substantial identity with the Drosophila shibire ( shi ts ) gene product ( Chen et al . , 1991 ; van der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 ) , which expresses a tempera - ture - sensitive mutation in the GTP - binding domain of the ﬂy dynamin . At the restrictive temperature , cells exhibit a defect in endocytosis ( Grigliatti et al . , 1973 ; Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983a , b ) . Further work revealed that shi ts mutants are generally deﬁcient at an early step in endocytosis , mainly , the ability to form coated vesicles at the plasma membrane ( Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983b ; Kessell et al . , 1989 ; Masur et al . , 1990 ) . In sup - port of these studies , transient overexpression of dom - inant - negative GTP - binding mutants of dynamin blocked clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Herskovits et al . , 1993 ; van der Bliek et al . , 1993 ; Damke et al . , 1994 , 1995 ) . More recently , dynamin has been localized to clathrin - coated pits at the plasma membrane in cul - tured cells ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) and to the necks of membrane invaginations and clathrin - coated pits in an isolated synaptosomal preparation ( Takei et al . , 1995 ) . For recent reviews on dynamin , see Robinson et al . ( 1994 ) , De Camilli et al . ( 1995 ) , Warnock and Schmid ( 1996 ) , and Urrutia et al . ( 1997 ) . Numerous biochemical studies have suggested that the dynamins bind to several different cellular pro - * Corresponding author .

Some of these binding pro - teins include microtubules ( Maeda et al . , 1992 ; Shpet - ner and Vallee , 1992 ) , phospholipids ( Tuma et al . , 1993 ) , and a subset of Src homology 3 domain - con - taining proteins ( Gout et al . , 1993 ; Herskovits et al . , 1993 ; Scaife et al . , 1994 ) . From these numerous inter - actions it is possible that dynamin may perform a variety of different processes at distinct cellular loca - tions . Indeed , dynamin has recently been implicated in several unique functions distinct from clathrin - me - diated endocytosis at the plasma membrane . These functions include internalization of caveolae ( Schnitzer et al . , 1996 ; Henley et al . , 1998 ; Oh et al . , 1998 ) , sorting of toxins from internal membrane com - partments ( Llorente et al . , 1998 ) , and formation of nascent secretory vesicles from the trans - Golgi net - work ( Henley and McNiven , 1996 ; Maier et al . , 1996 ; Jones et al . , 1998 ) . Therefore , it is tempting to predict that different members of the dynamin family are targeted to various cellular compartments to perform a similar function , mainly , the liberation of newly formed coated vesicles . It has become increasingly clear that the dynamin family of proteins is larger than once predicted . Sub - sequent to its initial identiﬁcation from mammalian brain , dynamin was thought to be expressed only in neuronal tissues ( Scaife and Margolis , 1990 ; Nakata et al . , 1991 ) . However , recent identiﬁcation and cloning of two additional dynamin genes from epithelial tis - sue ( Nakata et al . , 1993 ; Cook et al . , 1994 ; Sontag et al . , 1994 ) have demonstrated that dynamin isoforms are expressed in all cells . Conventional brain dynamin , dynamin I ( Dyn 1 ) , 1 is indeed neuronal speciﬁc ( Na - kata et al . , 1991 , 1993 ; Cook et al . , 1994 ; Sontag et al . , 1994 ) , dynamin II ( Dyn 2 ) is ubiquitously expressed ( Cook et al . , 1994 ; Sontag et al . , 1994 ) , and dynamin III ( Dyn 3 ) is restricted to testis , brain , and lung ( Nakata et al . , 1993 ; Cook et al . , 1996 ; reviewed by Robinson et al . , 1994 ; Urrutia et al . , 1997 ) . From these studies it is known that each dynamin has at least four alterna - tively spliced variants , which may result in the expres - sion of 12 different dynamin proteins in brain alone . Using long - distance RT - PCR from mRNA of various rat tissues , we have conducted an extensive character - ization of the expression of the dynamin isoforms in different tissue types and have identiﬁed . 25 different spliced variants of the three genes . In an attempt to deﬁne the subcellular localization of the different dy - namin family members , we have coupled green ﬂuo - rescent protein ( GFP ) to six distinct dynamin cDNAs ( two splice variants for each of the three genes ) for expression in a cultured , nonpolarized hepatocyte cell line ( Clone 9 ) . To ensure that the GFP tag did not alter the targeting or distribution of a speciﬁc dynamin , each dynamin protein examined was expressed with GFP at either the N - or C - terminal end , or expressed without a GFP tag . Subsequently , these transfected cells were stained with isoform - speciﬁc dynamin an - tibodies or membrane compartment - speciﬁc antibod - ies and analyzed by confocal microscopy . Interest - ingly , we found that the six different spliced forms of dynamin - GFP fusion proteins were localized to sev - eral distinct membrane or cytoplasmic compartments . These various locations include clathrin - coated buds at the plasma membrane and / or the Golgi apparatus , the cytosol , and various populations of presently un - identiﬁed membrane vesicles . These ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst evidence that the dynamin gene products are differentially distributed in mammalian cells where they may participate in various membrane trafﬁcking events . MATERIALS AND METHODS Tissues used for this study were harvested from 90 - to 100 - g male Sprague Dawley rats ( Harlan , Madison , WI ) . Miniprep Express and Luria - Bertani medium were from BIO 101 ( Vista , CA ) . Restriction enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim ( Indianapolis , IN ) and Life Technologies ( Gaithersburg , MD ) . 1 - kb and 1 - kb plus DNA ladder was from Life Technologies ( Grand Island , NY ) . A poly - clonal antibody to GFP was purchased from Clontech ( Palo Alto , CA ) , and a monoclonal antibody to GFP was a gift from Boehringer Mannheim . An anti - clathrin monoclonal antibody ( X22 ) was col - lected from the supernatant of the X22 hybridoma cell line ( Amer - ican Type Culture Collection [ ATCC ] , Rockville , MD ) . Secondary antibodies used were Texas Red ( TR ) - or FITC - conjugated goat anti - rabbit or goat anti - mouse and TR - dextran for immunocyto - chemical staining ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) . HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit and goat anti - mouse ( Bio - source International , Camarillo , CA ) were used for Western blot analysis . The Golgi - speciﬁc monoclonal antibody TGN38 was a gift from Dr . K . E . How - ell ( University of Colorado School of Medicine , Denver , CO ) . The anti - Dyn 2 antibody was raised against a peptide sequence repre - senting amino acids 761 – 785 of Dyn 2 , which is unique to the four Dyn 2 isoforms , sharing only 20 – 26 % identity with the other dy - namin gene products ( Henley et al . , 1998 ) . The anti - Pan MC65 antibody was raised against a conserved region of dynamin ( Dyn 1 and Dyn 2 ) . It was generated in rabbits and afﬁnity puriﬁed as described previously ( Henley et al . , 1998 ) . The anti - Dyn 3 antibody was raised against a C - terminal peptide , RLTLSAPLPRPASSRGPA - PAIPSPGPHS , and recognizes Dyn 3 speciﬁcally by immunoblot and immunoﬂuorescence analysis . All other chemicals and reagents unless otherwise stated were from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO ) . Isolation of Total RNA and Synthesis of First - Strand cDNA Total RNAs were extracted from brain , heart , kidney , liver , lung , pancreas , spleen , and testis . Rat tissues were removed , quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen , and ground in 7 ml of 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate ( 5 Prime - 3 Prime , Boulder , CO ) in a tissue homogenizer . Homogenates were passed ﬁve or six times through a 26 - gauge 1 / 2 A needle and then centrifuged for 15 min at 12 , 580 3 g , 20°C , in a Beckman centrifuge ( Beckman Instruments , Palo Alto , CA ) . The supernatants were layered over 4 ml of a 5 . 7 M CsCl cushion in polyallomer tubes . The samples were centrifuged for 22 h at 1 Abbreviations used : ATCC , American Type Culture Collection ; DRG , dorsal root ganglion ; D - PBS , Dulbecco’s PBS ; Dyn 1 , dy - namin I ; Dyn 2 , dynamin II ; Dyn 3 , dynamin III ; GFP , green ﬂuorescent protein ; RT , reverse transcription ; TR , Texas Red . H . Cao et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2596 35 , 000 3 g , 20°C , in a Beckman SW41 rotor . The RNA pellets were resuspended in 0 . 3 M sodium acetate ( pH 6 . 0 ) . Total RNAs were also extracted from Clone 9 , PC - 12 , and rat dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) cells ( pure and mixed ) by the mRNA single - step method ( Chomczynski and Sacchi , 1987 ) . First - strand cDNA synthesis by RT was performed using a SuperScript II RNase H 2 reverse transcrip - tase kit ( Life Technologies ) . RT was used to transcribe 1 – 5 m g of total RNA with 1 m l of 500 m g / ml oligo ( dT ) 12 – 18 primer . The reaction conditions were according to the manufacturer . PCR Speciﬁc oligonucleotide primers ( synthesized on an Applied Bio - systems , Foster City , CA , 394 DNA / RNA synthesizer ) for the three dynamin isoforms were designed ( MacVector , New Haven , CT ) using the different dynamin isoform cDNA sequences from Gen - Bank ( Accession numbers X54531 , L25605 , and D14076 ) . Full - length cDNAs encoding the different dynamin isoforms were ampliﬁed by long - distance RT - PCR . The primers’ design is shown in Figure 1A . The 5 9 PCR primers were complementary to the initiation sequence . The 3 9 PCR primers included the corresponding stop codon for each dynamin - coding region , thus discriminating the two alternative C termini of Dyn 1 and Dyn 3 . The PCRs were performed using the XL PCR kit ( Perkin Elmer - Cetus , Branchburg , NJ ) . The PCR cycle con - ditions were as follows : 28 cycles of 94°C for 1 min , 68°C ( for Dyn 1 ) , 65°C ( for Dyn 2 ) , 60°C ( for Dyn 3 ) for 5 min , and ﬁnally 72°C for 7 min . The reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electro - phoresis ( Figure 1B ) . Other speciﬁc oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify partial fragments of dynamin sequences from DRG cells ( Dyn 1 5 9 primer [ 5 9 - ACACGCTGCCGGGACTTC - 3 9 ] , 3 9 primer [ 5 9 - CAGCTGCCGGTAATCCTT - 3 9 ] ; Dyn 2 5 9 primer [ 5 9 - GAAGAGGGCCATACC - 3 9 ] , 3 9 primer [ 5 9 - AGTTGCGGATG - GTCTC - 3 9 ] ; Dyn 3 5 9 primer [ 5 9 - ACTTCCCCAGACTTTGTG - 3 9 ] , 3 9 primer [ 5 9 - ACGTCCCGGACTTTCAGG - 3 9 ] ) . The PCR reactions were performed in 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 4 ) , 50 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 2 . 5 U of Taq DNA polymerase using 30 PCR cycles ( 94°C for 1 min , 60°C for 2 min , and 72°C for 1 min ) . After PCR ampliﬁ - cation , the reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electro - phoresis ( see Figure 3B ) . The PCR fragments were ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pCR3 . 1 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . cDNA Cloning and Dynamin - GFP Expression Vector For subcloning of the full - length cDNA corresponding to Dyn 1 , Dyn 2 , and Dyn 3 , reampliﬁcation of the different isoforms was performed using PCR . The 5 9 and 3 9 PCR primers for Dyn 1 and Dyn 2 were designed to contain restriction sites Hin dIII and Eco RI , respectively . For Dyn 3 constructs , Eco RI sites were designed at the 5 9 end , and Bam HI sites were designed at the 3 9 end . The dynamin inserts from the pCR3 . 1 constructs were excised by digestion with the corresponding enzymes and subcloned into the expression vec - tors pEGFP - N 1 and pEGFP - C 1 ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) . The con - structs inserted into pEGFP - N 1 had no intervening stop codons . All the DNA constructs were veriﬁed by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing ( The Mayo Molecular Biology Core [ ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer , Perkin Elmer - Cetus ] ) . Sequences were analyzed using DNA * analysis software ( DNA star , Madison , WI ) . Cell Culture and Transfection Rat DRG cells were isolated and cultured as published elsewhere ( Conti et al . , 1997 ) . These preparations provided mixed cultures of DRGs and surrounding supportive cells . To obtain highly enriched ( 95 % ) DRGs without glial cells or ﬁbroblasts , cultures were treated with antimetabolites ( 5 ng / ml NGF , 10 % calf bovine serum , 10 2 5 M ﬂuorodeoxyuridine , and 10 2 5 M uridine ) for 5 d , and then the medium was replaced by medium without antimetabolites . This yielded a stable population of neurons without supporting Schwann cells or ﬁbroblasts ( Wood et al . , 1980 ) . PC - 12 cells , a pheochromo - cytoma cell line from rat adrenal glands ( ATCC CRL - 1721 ) , were maintained in 82 . 5 % F - 12K medium with 2 mM l - glutamine ad - justed to contain 1 . 5 g / l sodium bicarbonate , 15 % horse serum , 2 . 5 % fetal bovine serum , 100 U / ml penicillin , and 100 m g / ml streptomy - cin ( Life Technologies ) in 5 % CO 2 and 95 % air at 37°C . Cells were cultured in T - 75 ﬂasks ( Fisher Scientiﬁc , Pittsburgh , PA ) . Clone 9 cells , an epithelial cell line isolated from normal rat liver ( ATCC CRL - 1439 ) , were maintained in Ham’s F - 12K medium supple - mented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Life Technologies ) , 100 U / ml penicillin , and 100 m g / ml streptomycin in 5 % CO 2 and 95 % air at 37°C . Cells were cultured in T - 75 ﬂasks ( Fisher Scientiﬁc ) and on 22 - mm coverslips for transfections and immunocytochemistry , re - spectively . Plasmid DNA containing dynamin construct was puri - ﬁed by equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl - ethidium bromide gra - dients ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ) . Transfection of cells was performed by electroporation in a Gene Pulser II system ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) . Conﬂuent cells were trypsinized ( 1 3 trypsin - EDTA , 0 . 25 % Trypsin , 1 mM 4Na - EDTA ; Life Technologies ) , resuspended in 400 m l of PBS ( 134 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) at ; 3 3 10 6 cells / ml , and transferred to a sterile electroporation cuvette ( 0 . 4 cm ) with 20 – 50 m g of plasmid DNA . After a 20 min incubation on ice , cells were electroporated at 0 . 3 kV , 250 m F , and subsequently transferred to 100 - mm tissue culture dishes . After 24 h the cells were placed under selective pressure with a medium containing Geneticin ( G418 , 400 m g / ml ; Life Tech - nologies ) for 10 – 15 d . Resistant clones were isolated using cloning cylinders ( Bellco Glass , Vineland , NJ ) and transferred for expansion and analysis . Protein Extraction Stably transfected Clone 9 cells were harvested for biochemical analysis using standard procedures . Cells from one conﬂuent 100 - mm Petri dish were rinsed two or three times with cold PBS . Cells were scraped from the dishes with a cell lifter ( Costar , Cam - bridge , MA ) and homogenized over 10 min in radioimmunoprecipi - tation assay buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 1 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % deoxy - cholate , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 1 % SDS ) followed by a protease inhibitor mixture consisting of 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , 20 m g / ml soybean trypsin inhibitor , 20 m g / ml leupeptin , and a 1000 - fold dilution of a nuclease solution ( 20 mg / ml RNase A and 10 mg / ml DNase I ) . Lysates were then clariﬁed by centrifugation at 16 , 000 3 g for 10 min . All procedures were carried out at 4°C . Proteins were solubilized by boiling in 4 3 Laemmli sample buffer for 3 min . SDS - PAGE and Immunoblotting Protein concentrations were determined with bicinchonic acid ac - cording to the manufacturer ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , using BSA as a standard . Cellular proteins were separated by continuous SDS - PAGE under reducing conditions ( Laemmli , 1970 ) on 7 . 5 % poly - acrylamide gels using a bisacrylamide / acrylamide ratio of 1 : 37 . 5 . Protein bands were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinyldif - luoride membranes ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) for Western blotting ( Towbin et al . , 1979 ) . Membranes containing transferred proteins were blocked in PBS - Towbin ( 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 2 ) containing 5 % milk and washed in PBS - Towbin before incuba - tion with primary antibodies . Immunoreactive bands were detected with an appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to HRP . After each step , the membranes were washed with PBS - Towbin contain - ing 0 . 3 % Tween 20 . Membranes were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) and were exposed to autoradiographic ﬁlm ( Eastman Kodak , Rochester , NY ) to detect HRP . To estimate molecular weights , bands were com - pared with the following prestained standards : myosin , b - galacto - sidase , BSA , and ovalbumin ( Bio - Rad ) . Differential Distribution of the Dynamins Vol . 9 , September 1998 2597 Immunoﬂuorescence and Confocal Microscopy For immunoﬂuorescence and confocal microscopy , cells were grown on cover glasses for 1 – 2 d , rinsed with Dulbecco’s PBS ( D - PBS ; 8 . 1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 2 , 138 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 0 . 9 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 ) at room temperature and ﬁxed for 20 min with 2 . 5 % formaldehyde in piperazine - N , N 9 - bis ( 2 - ethanesulfonic acid ) buffer [ 0 . 1 M piperazine - N , N 9 - bis ( 2 - ethanesulfonic acid ) , pH 6 . 95 , 3 mM MgSO 4 , 1 mM EGTA ] . After rinsing with D - PBS , cells were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in D - PBS for 2 min , rinsed with D - PBS , and incubated in blocking buffer ( 5 % normal goat serum and 5 % glycerol in D - PBS ) for 1 h at 37°C . Cells were incubated in primary antibodies ( 1 – 40 m g / ml ) for 2 h at 37°C and rinsed repeat - edly with D - PBS before incubating in the appropriate ﬂuorescein - labeled secondary antibody ( 1 – 5 m g / ml ) for 1 h at 37°C . Cells were then washed extensively with D - PBS , rinsed brieﬂy with distilled water , and mounted on a glass slide in mounting reagent ( ProLong ; Molecular Probes ) . Stably transfected dynamin - GFP cells were incu - bated in medium containing 200 mM TR - conjugated dextran ( molec - ular weight , 3000 ; Molecular Probes ) to label late endosomes and lysosomes for 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , or 12 h at 37°C . The cells were rinsed with medium and with two changes of D - PBS containing 0 . 5 M NaCl . After rinsing with four changes of HBSS , the cells were ﬁxed by the same procedure . Cells were viewed with an Axiovert 35 epiﬂuorescence microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) equipped with a 100 - W mer - cury lamp using a 100 3 objective lens ( Zeiss Plan - Neoﬂuar , 1 . 30 ) and a confocal microscope ( Zeiss LSM - 310 equipped with an argon – kryp - ton laser ) using a 100 3 objective lens ; excitations were at 488 / 568 nm . Images were acquired on the microscope at 1024 3 1024 resolution over a 32 - s exposure period . Contrast and intensity for each image were manipulated uniformly using Adobe ( Mountain View , CA ) Pho - toshop software . RESULTS Expression of Multiple Dynamins in Different Tissues To deﬁne the cellular localization of dynamin family members , we ﬁrst attempted to establish the number of distinct spliced variants produced from the three known dynamin genes . Full - length cDNAs for the different dynamin isoforms were ampliﬁed by long - distance RT - PCR with oligonucleotides complemen - tary to dynamin sequences ( Nakata et al . , 1991 , 1993 ; Robinson et al . , 1993 ; Cook et al . , 1994 , 1996 ; Sontag et al . , 1994 ) . Figure 1A shows the speciﬁc oligode - oxynucleotide primers used in this study . The 5 9 PCR primers were complementary to the initiation se - quence , and the 3 9 PCR primers included the two alternative C termini of Dyn 1 and Dyn 3 . Figure 1B shows these RT - PCR products by agarose gel electro - phoresis . The sequencing results of several cDNA clones encoding different dynamin isoforms revealed four new spliced forms for Dyn 1 and nine new spliced forms for Dyn 3 ( Figure 2 ) . We have denoted clusters of splicing regions for each dynamin isoform with two splicing regions for Dyn 1 and Dyn 2 and three splicing regions for Dyn 3 . As shown previously ( Robinson et al . , 1993 ) , the ﬁrst splicing region of Dyn 1 contains either one of two sequences ( a and b forms ) of identical size but distinct nucleotide sequences . In addition , we have identiﬁed two new spliced variants in the second splicing region ( tail region ) making at least four distinct tails for Dyn 1 ( Figure 2 ) . These consist of an a tail of 20 amino acids , a b tail of 7 amino acids as reported by Robinson et al . , 1993 , a c tail of 49 amino acids , and a d tail of 12 amino acids ( Figure 2 ) . It is of interest that the c tail of Dyn 1 has a premature stop codon attributable to a 26 - nucleotide deletion , and the d tail has a 4 - nucleotide insertion . Therefore , Dyn 1 has at least eight spliced variants which we refer to as aa , ba , ab , bb , ac , bc , ad , and bd . For Dyn 3 we have identiﬁed an additional region of alternative splicing , making three distinct splicing regions . We now know that within the ﬁrst splicing region there is a 10 - amino - acid insertion ( b form ) and an additional variant encoding 48 amino acids ( c form ) with a pre - mature stop codon attributable to a 46 - nucleotide in - sertion ( Figure 2 ) . In addition , the novel second splic - ing region that we report here has three splice variants , a – c . The b form has an extra 4 - amino - acid insertion , and c has 14 amino acids . The b form at this second splicing region has a 12 - nucleotide insertion , whereas c and a are identical in size but distinct in nucleotide sequence . Interestingly , the c spliced form at this region is lung speciﬁc . Therefore , Dyn 3 has at least 13 spliced variants ( aaa , aba , bba , baa , bbb , bab , Figure 1 . Ampliﬁcation of three different dynamin isoforms ( Dyn 1 – 3 ) from rat brain by long - distance RT - PCR . cDNA was synthe - sized from 10 m g of total RNA from rat brain using an oligo ( dT ) n primer . Ampliﬁcation of the genes encoding full - length dynamin isoforms was performed using long - distance RT - PCR . Speciﬁc primers ( A ) were designed by MacVector and using the dynamin cDNA sequences from GenBank . The 5 9 PCR primers were comple - mentary to the initiation sequence . The 3 9 PCR primers included the corresponding stop codon for each dynamin - coding region , thus discriminating the two alternative C termini of Dyn 1 and Dyn 3 . After long - distance PCR , the reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis ( B ) . Approximately 2 . 6 - kb bands repre - sent each dynamin isoform . H . Cao et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2598 aab , abb , aca , acb , bca , bcb , and c ) . Despite the iden - tiﬁcation of numerous additional spliced variants for Dyn 1 and Dyn 3 , we have not identiﬁed any variants for Dyn 2 in addition to those originally reported by us and others ( Cook et al . , 1994 ; Robinson et al . , 1994 ; Sontag et al . , 1994 ) . Based on the PCR studies described above , at least 25 different spliced variants of the three currently identiﬁed dynamin genes are expressed in mamma - lian tissues . Table 1 summarizes these ﬁndings by listing the different dynamin forms found in seven different rat tissues , one type of epithelial cell ( Clone 9 ) , and three different populations of neuronal cells . There are 21 of these variants found in rat brain alone , which appears to be the only tissue expressing all three of the dynamin genes and the only tissue that expresses Dyn 1 . Furthermore , the expression of Dyn 3 is highly variable and is dependent on the speciﬁc spliced variant and the tissue examined . For example , only select forms of Dyn 3 are expressed in brain , heart , lung , and testis . It is also interesting to note that lung expresses several unique forms of Dyn 3 not found in any other tissue examined and that Dyn 3 is expressed in heart ( our unpublished results ) . Most surprising is the observation that PCR methods do not detect Dyn 2 in total mRNA prepared from highly enriched cultures of rat peripheral sensory neurons ( DRGs ) ( Figure 3 ) . We were able to detect all three dynamin gene products from total mRNA from rat brain ( Figure 1 ) , cultured PC - 12 cells , and mixed cul - tures of DRGs ( Figure 3 ) , which contain glial cells and ﬁbroblasts . However , in a puriﬁed population of DRGs , Dyn 2 PCR products were greatly reduced to near undetectable levels , whereas products for Dyn 1 and Dyn 3 remained unchanged . This suggests , but does not prove , that the Dyn 2 is expressed by the supporting cells and not the neurons . Future detailed studies applying multiple techniques to distinct neu - Figure 2 . More than 25 distinct dynamin mRNAs are expressed in rat tissues : schematic illustration of the dynamin family of proteins . The three known dynamin gene products are diagrammed , and the corresponding alternatively spliced sites are indicated . Amino acid sequences of 12 of the spliced variants were obtained from previously published studies ( Nakata et al . , 1991 , 1993 ; Robinson et al . , 1993 ; Cook et al . , 1994 , 1996 ; Sontag et al . , 1994 ) and were published previously in two separate reviews ( Robinson et al . , 1994 ; Urrutia et al . , 1997 ) . Sequence information for the additional 13 inserts or substitutions was obtained in this study by long - distance RT - PCR of total mRNA from several rat tissues . We have denoted the clustered sites of alternative splicing within each transcript as “splicing regions , ” which are blue . Dyn 1 and Dyn 2 each have two splicing regions , whereas Dyn 3 has three splicing regions . Note that Dyn 1 and Dyn 3 each have a spliced insert encoding premature terminations in splicing regions 2 or 1 and 2 , respectively . Yellow represents the GTP - binding sites ; red and green represent the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) and proline - rich ( PR ) domains , respectively . Differential Distribution of the Dynamins Vol . 9 , September 1998 2599 ronal and glial cell populations will be needed to clearly deﬁne the expression of the different dynamin family members in mammalian brain . Establishment of Stable Epithelial Cell Lines Expressing Six Different Dynamin - GFP Fusion Proteins Upon detection of the additional alternatively spliced dynamin transcripts described above , our goal was to test whether the corresponding dynamin proteins oc - cupy distinct cytoplasmic locations . In other words , might the spliced inserts of the different dynamin variants provide targeting , positional , or functional information , which could direct these proteins to dis - tinct cytoplasmic locations ? To this end we have stably transfected a nonpolarized rat hepatocyte cell line ( Clone 9 ) , which normally expresses only Dyn 2 , with full - length cDNAs encoding six different dynamin spliced forms [ Dyn 1 ( ab ) and Dyn 1 ( bb ) , Dyn 2 ( aa ) and Dyn 2 ( ab ) , and Dyn 3 ( aaa ) and Dyn 3 ( baa ) ] . These cDNAs were tagged with GFP at either the N - or C - terminal end . As an additional control we also gen - erated stable Clone 9 cells transfected with the same cDNAs but subcloned into a mammalian expression vector ( pCR3 . 1 ) without the GFP tag ( see MATERIALS AND METHODS ) . To conﬁrm that transfected Clone 9 cells expressed Dyn - GFP , total proteins from homog - enates of the six different dynamin - expressing cell lines were separated by SDS - PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with a Pan - dynamin antibody ( MC65 ) , isoform - speciﬁc antibodies for Dyn 2 and Dyn 3 , or a GFP antibody .

Cao et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2600 immunoblotting of control cells with the Pan - dynamin antibody revealed a single band of the appropriate molecular mass ( 100 kDa ) . In contrast , immunoblots of cells expressing the four different Dyn 1 - and Dyn 2 - GFP fusion proteins displayed a conventional dy - namin band and one of greater molecular mass . Sub - sequent blotting of these cell homogenates with a GFP - speciﬁc antibody conﬁrmed that the higher - mo - lecular - mass bands represented the dynamin - GFP fu - sion proteins . Surprisingly , the Pan - dynamin antibody used to detect the Dyn 1 and Dyn 2 fusion proteins did not recognize either of the expressed Dyn 3 variants . It was unexpected that a Pan - antibody made to a pep - tide conserved in all three of the dynamin isoforms did not detect an unfolded protein immobilized on polyvinyldiﬂuoride membranes . However , upon closer inspection , we noted that of the 23 amino acids that constituted the MC65 Pan - antibody peptide anti - gen , there were no mismatched residues with Dyn 2 but two and ﬁve amino acids mismatched for Dyn 1 and Dyn 3 , respectively . As a result , homogenates of Dyn 3 - GFP - expressing cells were immunoblotted with a mixture of isoform - speciﬁc antibodies to Dyn 2 and Dyn 3 ( Figure 4B ) . These antibodies detected the con - ventional dynamin band and the higher - molecular - mass dynamin - GFP bands as conﬁrmed with the GFP antibody . These manipulations conﬁrmed the expres - sion of the different dynamin proteins in the Clone 9 cells and , importantly , demonstrated that the levels of Dyn 1 - GFP and Dyn 2 - GFP expression did not signif - icantly exceed that of the endogenous Dyn 2 normally expressed by these cells . Distinct Cellular Distributions of the Dynamin Isoforms After establishing six Clone 9 cell lines , each express - ing a different dynamin - GFP fusion protein , we next tested whether the cytoplasmic distribution of these dynamins was similar or distinct . After ﬁxation and permeabilization , cells were mounted on slides and viewed by confocal microscopy . Cells transfected with a pEGFP - N 1 or - C 1 vector alone displayed a diffuse ﬂuorescence throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus ( our unpublished results ) . In contrast , cells expressing ﬁve of the six different dynamin - GFP proteins re - vealed a striking localization to vesicular membrane compartments . Perhaps the most dramatic differences in the cellular distribution of the dynamins were dis - played by cells expressing the two forms of Dyn 2 ( Figure 5 ) . Because Dyn 2 is the only dynamin identi - ﬁed in Clone 9 cells to date , the localization of these endogenous proteins may also be the most relevant . As shown in Figure 5 , a and b , cells expressing Dyn 2 ( aa ) - GFP exhibited a prominent labeling of numerous punctate spots in close association with either the plasma membrane or reticular tubules about the nu - cleus . When these cells were double stained with an - tibodies to the clathrin heavy chain , most of the Dyn 2 - GFP structures were labeled . From this we con - cluded that Dyn 2 ( aa ) was sequestered to clathrin - coated pits and vesicles at the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus . This same clonal cell line was also used in an earlier report demonstrating that dy - namin participates in Golgi function ( Jones et al . , 1998 ) . To conﬁrm that this perinuclear structure was Figure 4 . Expression of six distinct dy - namin - GFP constructs in stably transfected epithelial cells . To test whether transfected Clone 9 cells were expressing dynamin - GFP , total protein from homogenates of the six different dynamin - expressing cell lines was separated by SDS - PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the Pan - dy - namin antibody ( MC65 ) , isoform - speciﬁc antibodies for Dyn 2 and Dyn 3 , or a GFP antibody . ( A ) Immunoblots of homogenates from cells expressing two spliced variants of either Dyn 1 - GFP or Dyn 2 - GFP . The Pan - dynamin antibody ( MC65 ) recognized both the endogenous dynamin protein band at 100 kDa and the dynamin fusion protein band at 120 kDa . As expected , the higher - molecular - mass band was only seen when blotted with the anti - GFP antibody . For im - munoblot analysis of Dyn 3 - GFP - express - ing cells ( B ) , a combination of isoform - spe - ciﬁc antibodies to Dyn 2 and Dyn 3 was used , because the Dyn 3 - GFP fusion protein was not recognized by the Pan - MC65 anti - body . With these antibodies both the en - dogenous dynamin and expressed Dyn 3 - GFP were seen . Differential Distribution of the Dynamins Vol . 9 , September 1998 2601 Figure 5 . H . Cao et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2602 indeed the Golgi , cells were double labeled with an antibody speciﬁc for a trans - Golgi – speciﬁc protein of unknown function called TGN38 ( Crosby et al . , 1992 ; Ponnambalam et al . , 1996 ) . As predicted , the TGN38 antibody staining of the perinuclear Dyn 2 - GFP - posi - tive tubules was nearly complete ( Jones et al . , 1998 ) . Finally , in addition to the association of Dyn 2 ( aa ) - GFP with clathrin - associated vesicles at the Golgi and the plasma membrane , we also observed a prominent accumulation of the fusion protein in cortical mem - brane rufﬂes and lamellapodia . This localization was not seen in any of the cells expressing the other dy - namin - GFP proteins . To test whether alternatively spliced variants ex - pressed from the same dynamin gene might exhibit a distinct cytoplasmic localization in cells , we next viewed Clone 9 cells expressing Dyn 2 ( ab ) - GFP . This spliced form of Dyn 2 makes a particularly interesting comparison with the Dyn 2 ( aa ) - GFP shown in Figure 5 . Dyn 2 ( ab ) form is missing four amino acids ( GEIL ) at the second splicing region b . Therefore , we were surprised to ﬁnd that cells expressing the modestly shorter Dyn 2 spliced form , Dyn 2 ( ab ) , revealed a distinctly different staining pattern . As shown in Fig - ure 5 , c and d , Dyn 2 ( ab ) - GFP is localized to numerous punctate spots on the plasma membrane . Many , but not all , of these foci stain positive for clathrin ( Figure 5 , c 9 and c 0 ) , although there are numerous clathrin pits that do not colocalize with the Dyn 2 ( ab ) - GFP . Most striking was that none of the dynamin - GFP in these transfected cells appeared to associate with the Golgi apparatus , as conﬁrmed by staining with antibodies to clathrin ( Figure 5c 9 ) and TGN38 ( Figure 5d 9 ) . Thus , the insertion of just four amino acids appears to have profound effects on whether Dyn 2 is , or not , associ - ated with the Golgi apparatus . Like the Dyn 2 spliced variants , two different forms of Dyn 1 expressed in Clone 9 cells also localized to strikingly different cytoplasmic structures . In this study we chose to express Dyn 1 ( ab ) - GFP and Dyn 1 ( bb ) - GFP . These spliced variants are identical except for a 46 - amino - acid substitution between amino acids 399 and 444 ( Figure 2 ) . Only 14 of the 46 amino acids constituting this insert are different between the two Dyn 1 forms . Expression of Dyn 1 ( ab ) - GFP in Clone 9 cells resulted in a prominent labeling of numerous punctate foci of various sizes distributed along the plasma membrane and throughout the cytoplasm ( Figure 6 , a and b ) . Despite the vast difference in size between the different dynamin structures , most ap - peared to costain with clathrin antibodies . Few if any GFP - positive structures could be seen in the perinu - clear Golgi region . It is of interest that these larger punctate foci were clathrin positive . Such large clath - rin structures are normally not observed in these cells except for ones expressing this particular dynamin form . Thus , the expression of a foreign dynamin form in these cells , Dyn 1 ( ab ) , appears to have marked effects on clathrin distribution . To test whether the larger GFP - positive structures might be lysosomal or - ganelles , transfected cells were incubated with TR - dextran for 1 – 12 h before ﬁxation and ﬂuorescence microscopy . As shown in Figure 6 , b 9 and b 0 ( 4 h ) , none of the large Dyn 1 ( ab ) - GFP structures appeared to contain endocytosed dextran . In contrast to the Dyn 1 ( ab ) - GFP form , Dyn 1 ( bb ) - GFP exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in transfected cells with some localization to the Golgi apparatus ( Figure 6 , arrows ) as conﬁrmed by double - immunoﬂuorescence staining for clathrin ( Figure 6c – c 0 ) and the trans - Golgi protein TGN38 ( Figure 6d – d 0 ) . Thus , like the Dyn 2 spliced variants , both of the Dyn 1 proteins expressed , which differ by only 14 of 851 amino acids , reside on drasti - cally different cytoplasmic compartments . Finally , to complete this initial study on the distri - bution of the different dynamin isoforms in epithelial cells , we have expressed two distinct spliced forms of Dyn 3 - GFP [ Dyn 3 ( aaa ) and Dyn 3 ( baa ) ] in Clone 9 cells . As shown in Figure 2 , the Dyn 3 transcript undergoes the most extensive alternative splicing of the three dynamin genes with at least 13 different forms produced from three distinct sites , including a premature stop codon insertion . The two Dyn 3 forms analyzed in this study differ by only a 10 - amino - acid insertion at the ﬁrst splicing region located at residue 516 . As for the Dyn 1 and Dyn 2 gene products , the two Dyn 3 - GFP fusion proteins also exhibited different distributions in Clone 9 cells . Cells transfected with Dyn 3 ( baa ) - GFP revealed a bright , punctate , vesicular - like staining , which did not colocalize with clathrin either at the plasma membrane or the Golgi area ( Fig - ure 7a – a 0 ) . Furthermore , these brightly stained vesic - ular structures did not appear to be lysosomal or - ganelles , because they did not label with endocytosed TR - dextran ( Figure 7b – b 0 ) . In contrast , Dyn 3 ( aaa ) - GFP in Clone 9 cells was distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and had some modest as - sociation with the Golgi apparatus when viewed in cells double stained for clathrin ( Figure 7c – c 0 ) . Figure 5 ( cont ) . Two variants of Dyn 2 - GFP show dramatic differ - ences in afﬁnity for the Golgi apparatus . Double - immunoﬂuores - cence staining of cells expressing Dyn 2 ( aa ) - GFP with antibodies to clathrin ( a – a 0 ) or TGN38 ( b – b 0 ) revealed that Dyn 2 ( aa ) - GFP has a strong afﬁnity for membrane tubules of the Golgi apparatus ( ar - rows ) . Interestingly , Dyn 2 ( aa ) was also localized in the cortical rufﬂes of transfected cells ( a and a 0 , arrowheads ) . In sharp contrast to the Dyn 2 ( aa ) spliced variant that associated with clathrin at both the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus , Dyn 2 ( ab ) - GFP , a form different by only a four - amino - acid deletion in the second splicing region , localized to clathrin - coated pits at the plasma mem - brane only . No afﬁnity for the Golgi apparatus ( arrows ) in cells stained with a clathrin antibody ( c – c 0 ) or a TGN38 antibody ( d – d 0 ) was seen . Bar , 10 m m . Differential Distribution of the Dynamins Vol . 9 , September 1998 2603 Figure 6 . H . Cao et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2604 DISCUSSION Tissue - speciﬁc Expression of Multiple Dynamin Variants The central focus of this study was twofold . First , our aim was to identify and deﬁne the number of spliced variants produced from the three dynamin genes pre - viously cloned and sequenced from mammalian cells ( Nakata et al . , 1991 , 1993 ; Robinson et al . , 1993 ; Cook et al . , 1994 , 1996 ; Sontag et al . , 1994 ) . Second , we tested whether the different dynamin gene products are di - rected to various cytoplasmic membranous organelles where they might perform similar but distinct func - tions . Previous to this study , it had been reported that there were four different spliced variants produced from each dynamin gene , resulting in a total of 12 forms ( for reviews , see Robinson et al . , 1994 ; Urrutia et al . , 1997 ) . Using a PCR - based approach ( Figure 1 ) , we have identiﬁed an additional 13 spliced variants , mak - ing a total of 25 spliced forms , 8 forms for Dyn 1 and 13 forms for Dyn 3 . We have not identiﬁed any addi - tional forms of Dyn 2 , which remains at four variants ( Figure 2 ) . The tissue distribution of these dynamin forms is summarized in Table 1 . Brain and lung ex - press the most isoforms , with 21 and 17 forms , respec - tively , whereas only the four forms of Dyn 2 are detected in epithelial - based tissues such as kidney , liver , and pancreas . Why an epithelial tissue such as testis expresses nine forms of Dyn 3 and Dyn 2 is unclear . We were surprised to ﬁnd that little , if any , Dyn 2 is expressed in highly enriched cultures of rat peripheral sensory neurons ( DRGs ) when compared with the same cultures containing substantial numbers of non - neuronal cells such as glial cells and ﬁbroblasts ( Fig - ure 3 ) . Whereas all three dynamin transcripts were detected in the mixed cultures , the Dyn 2 transcript was almost totally ablated upon removal of the sup - portive cells . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst study aimed at deﬁning the expression of the different dy - namin gene products in an isolated neuronal popula - tion compared with the intact brain . It suggests that the Dyn 2 detected in brain by us and others may come from other cell types found in this complex tissue . Alternatively , Dyn 2 may be selectively ex - pressed only in speciﬁc subpopulations of neurons such as motor versus sensory neurons versus neuroen - docrine cells . In contrast , we did identify all three dynamin gene products ( 21 transcripts ) in PC - 12 cells ( Figure 3 ) . Whether the expression of the dynamins in these neuronally derived cells originating from a pheochromocytoma is truly representative of differen - tiated neuroepithelial cells or has been altered by neo - plasia is unclear . Examination of distinct neuronal cell populations at different developmental stages using isoform - speciﬁc probes combined with in situ hybrid - ization techniques will prove informative . Altered Cytoplasmic Distributions for the Dynamin Proteins : Does Location Correlate with Function ? In an attempt to test whether the different dynamin proteins associate with multiple cellular organelles , we have expressed dynamin - GFP fusion proteins in a normal rat hepatocyte cell line , Clone 9 cells . These cells express all four forms of Dyn 2 ( Table 1 ) . Al - though all of the images displayed in this study ( Fig - ures 5 – 7 ) represent cell lines expressing GFP - coupled to the C termini of the different dynamin proteins , we have also closely examined and compared cells ex - pressing the same dynamin cDNAs with GFP coupled to the N - termini and without GFP ( our unpublished results ) . The cells expressing untagged dynamin forms were stained with isoform - speciﬁc antibodies to Dyn 1 , Dyn 2 , and Dyn 3 as well as with the Pan - antibodies MC63 and MC65 . Despite the GFP modiﬁcations we did not observe any changes in the cellular distribu - tion of a speciﬁc dynamin protein based on the attach - ment site of the GFP tag , suggesting that GFP does not hinder appropriate targeting of a dynamin to a mem - branous organelle . Finally , the expression levels of dynamin - GFP in these cells were not high . As shown in Figure 4 , levels of the expressed fusion proteins were equal or less than levels of the endogenous dy - namin . This modest level of expression makes it un - likely that the dynamins would be forced to interact with membranous organelles in a random , nonspeciﬁc manner . Because our Pan - dynamin antibodies did not recognize both the endogenous Dyn 2 and the expressed Dyn 3 - GFP in the same cell , we cannot make any direct conclusions about expression levels for Dyn 3 . Although the Dyn 3 bands are signiﬁcantly weaker than those of the Dyn 2 in the same cells ( Figure 4B ) , this could be due to differences in antibody sensitivity . Based on the ex - pression levels for the other four forms of Dyn 1 and Dyn 2 , which used the same expression vectors , we indirectly conclude that the levels of Dyn 3 in these cells do not exceed endogenous levels of Dyn 2 . Figure 6 ( cont ) . Different distributions for two forms of Dyn 1 - GFP in Clone 9 cells . Stably transfected Clone 9 cells expressing Dyn 1 ( ab ) - GFP were immunostained with antibodies to clathrin ( a – a 0 ) or labeled with internalized ﬂuorescent dextran ( b – b 0 ) to identify the endosomal and lysosomal compartments . Whereas the Dyn 1 ( ab ) - GFP appeared to colocalize precisely with clathrin - coated pits at the plasma membrane ( boxed regions ) , there was no colocalization with clathrin at the Golgi apparatus . Large vesiclular structures associ - ated with Dyn 1 - GFP patches were seen in these transfected cells and had no colocalization with endocytosed dextran ( b – b 0 ) suggest - ing that these structures do not represent a lysosomal compartment . In contrast to Dyn 1 ( ab ) - GFP , Dyn 1 ( bb ) - GFP exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in transfected cells with some localization to the Golgi apparatus ( arrows ) , as conﬁrmed by double - immun - oﬂuorescence staining for clathrin ( c – c 0 ) and the trans - Golgi protein TGN38 ( d – d 0 ) . Bar , 10 m m . Differential Distribution of the Dynamins Vol . 9 , September 1998 2605 Because the substantial size of the dynamin family prohibits detailed study of all forms , we have selected two variants expressed from each of the three genes . The dynamin proteins ( Dyn 1 – 3 ) are strongly related , 75 – 80 % similar depending on the variants compared , and spliced variants generated from each dynamin gene may differ by only several amino acids . Our goal in this study was to test not only whether the related Figure 7 . Dyn 3 - GFP forms expressed in Clone 9 cells distribute diffusely to the cytoplasm or to unidentiﬁed vesicular structures . Fluorescence images of Dyn 3 ( baa ) - GFP - transfected cells reveal a prominent population of brightly labeled vesicles , which did not colocalize with clathrin ( a – a 0 ) at either the plasma membrane ( boxes ) or the Golgi apparatus ( arrows ) . These dynamin - associated vesicles did not colocalize with endocytosed dextran ( boxed regions ) , suggesting they are not late endocytic compartments ( b – b 0 ) . In contrast , cells expressing Dyn 3 ( aaa ) - GFP [ a form differing from Dyn 3 ( baa ) by only a 10 - amino - acid insertion at the ﬁrst splicing region ] showed only a diffuse cytoplasmic ﬂuorescence with a slight association with the Golgi apparatus , as demonstrated by costaining with an antibody to clathrin ( c – c 0 ) . Bar , 10 m m . H . Cao et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2606 dynamin gene products might target to distinct cellu - lar locations but also whether modest insertional or substitutional changes within a spliced variant could alter distribution of the protein . The spliced forms manipulated in this study are highly similar to each other . Dyn 1 ( ab ) and Dyn 1 ( bb ) differ from each other by only 14 amino acids within a 46 - residue insertional substitution . Dyn 2 ( aa ) and Dyn 2 ( ab ) are identical except for the four - amino - acid insertion GEIL at resi - due 516 . Finally Dyn 3 ( baa ) and Dyn 3 ( aaa ) differ by only 10 amino acids , also at residue 516 ( Figure 2 ) . Despite these seemingly small differences in primary sequence , the contrasts in cellular localizations be - tween these expressed fusion proteins could not be more striking . Indeed , at least four distinct morpho - logical phenotypes of a possible six were generated from the different fusion protein – expressing cell lines ( Table 2 ) . These include a strong association with clathrin - coated vesicles at the plasma membrane ( Fig - ures 5a – d and 6 , a and b ) or at the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus ( Figure 5 , a and b ) , a diffuse cytosolic distribution ( Figures 6 , c and d , and 7c ) , an association with medium - sized vesicular structures , which are not clathrin positive ( Figure 7 , a and b ) , and a localization of dynamin into membrane rufﬂes or lamellapodia ( Figure 5a ) . Whether the diffuse distri - bution of some of the dynamin proteins represents a truly cytosolic localization or an association to vesicles too small to be resolved is undeﬁned . Perhaps the most graphic example of positional information pro - vided by a small - sized insertional variant is demon - strated by the Dyn 2 - GFP - expressing cells . Although both Dyn 2 proteins show a strong colocalization with clathrin - coated pits , only Dyn 2 ( aa ) is associated with the Golgi apparatus , whereas Dyn 2 ( ab ) shows little , if any , Golgi afﬁnity . As mentioned above , these two Dyn 2 variants differ by only four amino acids ( GEIL ) . The fact that only four amino acids , which are not situated in either the pleckstrin homology domain or the proline - rich domains of the dynamin protein , have such an effect makes this observation surprising . Cur - rently , we are conducting point mutational analysis of this small insert to test whether we can enhance or abolish the Dyn 2 ( aa ) – Golgi interaction . Finally , it will be interesting to test whether two speciﬁc insertional variations , Dyn 1 ( ac ) and Dyn 1 ( bc ) , are expressed in neurons and whether they associate with clathrin - coated vesicles . Both of these dynamin proteins would have substantial alterations in a nine - amino - acid se - quence near the C terminus ( aa 786 – 794 ) , which has been demonstrated by Shpetner and colleagues ( 1996 ) to be essential for clathrin association . Although surprising , there is precedence for such small insertional variations changing the cytoplasmic distribution of a protein . For example , the mammalian family of plasma membrane calcium pumps com - prises four distinct genes with four spliced variants for each ( Penniston et al . , 1997 ) . It has been shown that most , if not all , of these mRNAs are expressed in different cell types and are positioned at distinct mem - brane domains where they may respond differently to a given cell stimulus . A very relevant example of different cellular locations for proteins arising from the same gene has been reported by Montmayeur and Borrelli ( 1994 ) , who demonstrated that an alterna - tively spliced C terminus of the heterotrimeric GTP - binding protein a - subunit is responsible for changing the distribution of this protein from plasma membrane to the Golgi apparatus . Thus , for the dynamin family , we predict that the different gene products are tar - geted to discrete membranous organelles where they may participate in the formation of nascent vesicles . In the simplest scenario one could postulate that each dynamin protein functions at a distinct cellular site not unlike that observed for the kinesin ( Hirokawa , 1998 ) and myosin ( Mermall et al . , 1998 ) families of molecular motors . Support for this basic premise comes not only from the data presented in this study but also from other reports that dynamin proteins appear to play a role in caveolar scission ( Schnitzer et al . , 1996 ; Henley et al . , 1998 ; Oh et al . , 1998 ) , liberation of clathrin - and nonclathrin - coated vesicles from the trans - Golgi net - work ( Jones et al . , 1998 ) , transport of toxins from the endosome to the Golgi ( Llorente et al . , 1998 ) , and vesicle trafﬁc from the endoplasmic reticulum ( Yoon et al . , 1998 ) . Most recently , a study using morphological and biochemical techniques has demonstrated the lo - calization of Dyn 2 to membrane rufﬂes and lamel - lapodia ( Figure 5a ) in cultured cells , where it interacts speciﬁcally with the actin - binding protein cortactin ( McNiven , Kim , Krueger , Cao , and Wong , unpub - lished results ) . Finally , recent observations made in Madin – Darby canine kidney cells expressing either Dyn 1 or Dyn 2 ( S . Schmid , personal communication ) suggest that mutants in Dyn 2 alter endocytosis from both the apical and basal plasma membranes , whereas a Dyn 1 mutant affects endocytosis only at the apical plasma membrane . Although Madin – Darby canine kidney cells do not express Dyn 1 , these ﬁndings support the model that different dynamins are tar - geted to and function at different cellular sites . Al - though a one - dynamin protein - per - organelle model is attractive for cells and tissues that express a dozen Table 2 .

Although neu - rons perform a variety of specialized functions , it is difﬁcult to predict why a neuronal cell would require up to four times more dynamin forms than would other polarized cells such as the hepatocyte or nephro - cyte , which also perform numerous sophisticated traf - ﬁcking functions . Certainly , future studies combining GFP expression systems with site - directed mutations of speciﬁc dynamin variants will prove informative . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Dr . A . M . Conti and J .
