In the study , multi - target siRNAs were designed to inhibit NET - 1 , EMS1 and VEGF genes in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells . And multi - target siRNAs showed better silencing effects on NET - 1 , EMS1 and VEGF , compared with single target siRNA . Moreover , multi - target siRNA showed greater suppression effects on proliferation , migration , invasion , angiogenesis and induced apoptosis in HCC cells . The results suggested that multi - target siRNA might be a preferred strategy for cancer therapy and NET - 1 , EMS1 and VEGF could be effective targets for HCC treatments . Key words : multi - target siRNA , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , NET - 1 , EMS1 , VEGF . Introduction RNA interference ( RNAi ) has become a popular approach recently , RNAi technology is applied for posttranscriptional gene silencing which triggered by small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) [ 1 - 3 ] . RNAi therapies have rapidly been advanced in clinical trials for the treatment of various human diseases , especially various human cancers [ 4 - 6 ] , and the strategy of multiple gene - targeted siRNAs is considered to be a good way for controlling complex disease systems [ 7 , 8 ] , such as hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) [ 9 ] . HCC is the sixth most common malignancy tumor in the world and HCC has several complex and genetic alterations [ 10 ] . But the mechanisms of initiation and progression of HCC have not been made clear completely . Even though there are potential curative treatments , HCC can also easily become a poor prognosis tumor with the characteristics of high recurrence rate and rapid progress [ 11 ] . Therefore , development and identification of novel effective agents , such as siRNAs , that are able to suppress HCC effectively is imperative . NET - 1 gene is a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily ( TM4SF ) [ 12 ] , it is a tumor - related gene and found to be high expressed in many human tumor tissues [ 13 - 17 ] . NET - 1 overexpression was also strong - related to pathological grading and clinical stages in HCC [ 18 ] . EMS1 is a cytoskeleton reorganization related gene , its coding protein is cortical actin - binding protein ( cortactin ) with binding ability to F - actin [ 19 ] . Studies found that cortactin could bind to Arp2 / 3 , and influence cell motility , it also was considered has a relationship with cell migration [ 18 ] . Cortactin is a substrate of oncogene src , so its functions in tumors are studied deeply , and EMS1 was found high expressed in hepatocarcinoma , breast cancer and head and neck cancer , it had relationship with cancer invasion and transfer [ 20 - 23 ] . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) is a well - known gene in cancer therapy researches , angiogenesis inhibition is considered as an effective Ivyspring International Publisher Journal of Cancer 2016 , Vol . 7 http : / / www . jcancer . org 1318 way for tumor treatment , thus VEGF is a good target for cancer therapy [ 24 - 26 ] . In the study , we intended to evaluate the effects of multiple targeting of NET - 1 , EMS1 and VEGF genes on biological behavior of HCC cell in - vitro . Materials and Methods Cell Lines and Cell Culture Human embryonic kidney cells ( HEK293 ) , human HCC cells ( MHCC97H , MHCC97L , HepG2 , SMMC - 7721 ) and human normal liver cells ( LO2 ) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM , Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Gibco ) , 2 mM L - glutamine , 100 U / ml of penicillin and 100 μg / ml of streptomycin . These cell lines were purchased from the Institute of Cell Biology , Chinese Academy of Sciences , and cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5 % CO 2 . Multi - target siRNA Design and siRNA Transfection The sequence of NET - 1 ( Accssion No . NM 005727 . 3 ) , EMS1 ( Accssion No . NM 053056 ) and VEGF ( Accssion No . NM 001287044 . 1 ) were obtained from National Center of Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) GenBank ( USA ) , and the single target siRNAs which targeting either NET - 1 , EMS1 or VEGF ( NET - 1 _ siR , EMS1 _ siR and VEGF _ siR , 19 bp duplex with 2 - nt 3’ - overhangs ) were designed and screened by our precious studies [ 27 , 28 ] . And a siRNA which sequence has no homology with human genes was designed as negative control ( NC _ siR ) . All RNA oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized by Biomics Biotechnologies Co . , Ltd . ( Biomics Biotech , China ) . The oligonucleotide sequences were shown in Table 1 . The cells were transfected in - vitro with siRNAs using Lipofectamine ® 2000 transfection reagent ( ThermoFisher , USA ) according to the manufactures’ instructions . Multi - target siRNAs Design and Synthesis The multi - target siRNA ( mtg _ siRs ) constructs targeting NET - 1 , EMS1 and VEGF were designed according to the principle of Biomics Biotech ( China ) ( sequences shown in Table 2 ) . The long single stranded RNAs ( the length was > 21 nt ) were synthesized by in vitro transcription mediated by T7 RNA polymerase . Briefly , T7 RNA polymerase promoter ( 5’ - CACTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG - 3’ ) conjugated DNA oligos that complementary to the interest RNAs were chemically synthesized . The RNAs were synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase with the rNTPs at 37 °C for 5 h . Final RNA products were obtained post purification . Table 1 .

Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay The siRNA validation vector siQuant ( kindly provided by Dr . Quan Du of Peking University ) [ 29 ] was used for detection of the gene silencing activity of mtg _ siRs . When the siRNA validation vectors ( siQNET - 1 , siQEMS1 and siQVEGF ) were constructed , the activities of mtg _ siRs were analyzed by dual luciferase reporter ( DLR ) assay according to the protocol of Du Q et al . [ 30 ] . Briefly , the DNA oligonucleotides were designed ( Table 3 ) , synthesized ( Biomics Biotech , China ) and annealed to DNA duplex . Then they were ligated to construct siRNA validation vectors containing siRNA target site of NET - 1 , EMS1 or VEGF , and all constructs were verified by sequencing . HEK293 cells were grown and seeded into 24 - well plates at 1×10 5 cells / well for 24 h before transfection . The validation vector was co - transfected with pRL - TK ( Promega , USA ) with or without siRNAs . The cells were harvested after 24 h , according to the DLR assay manual ( Promega , USA ) . And the activities of luciferase were measured on a Luminometer ( Promega , USA ) . The firefly luciferase signal was normalized to the renilla luciferase signal for each individual well , and the knockdown efficacy of each siRNA was evaluated by relative luciferase activity unit ( RLU ) .

The scratch caused in groups of untreated and NC _ siR nearly closed completely after 72 h , but the cells in treatment with NET - 1 _ siR , EMS1 _ siR and VEGF _ siR were not able to move toward the center of the wound . Compared to the NC _ siR treated and untreated cells , the abilities of wound healing in NET - 1 _ siR , EMS1 _ siR and VEGF _ siR treated cells were decreased , and the migration distance in mtg _ siR1 treated cells was significantly shorter than that of NET - 1 _ siR , EMS1 _ siR and VEGF _ siR ( Fig . 8E ) . Discussion Multi - targeting therapies for cancers have been considered to be an effective approach , and RNAi strategy is a better method for multiple genes suppression , and there are many siRNA drugs in clinical trials which two or more gene inhibition simultaneously [ 8 ] . On the other hand , structural modified siRNAs had been widely used in RNAi therapeutics development , especially long double - stranded RNAs ( dsRNA ) were designed for carrying two or more siRNA sequences which targeting two or more parts in one mRNA or two or more mRNAs [ 34 - 36 ] . Current studies showed that , once long dsRNAs get into mammalian cells , they can be used as Dicer’s substrates for siRNAs processing , then the corresponding genes could be inhibited effectively by siRNAs [ 1 , 2 , 8 ] . In our study , we designed a series of multi - target siRNA structures for triple cancer genes inhibition in hepatocellular carcinoma . We chose NET - 1 , EMS1 and VEGF as three target genes . NET - 1 was reported as a cancer cell proliferation related gene [ 37 ] , EMS1 was a cancer cell motility and transfer gene [ 28 ] and VEGF was angiogenesis related gene in tumor tissues [ 25 ] . In our previous studies , we designed and screened better siRNAs that targeting NET - 1 , EMS1 or VEGF gene respectively [ 27 , 28 ] . Here , the multi - target siRNAs were designed for carrying on three different siRNA sequences which targeting NET - 1 , EMS1 and VEGF genes ( Table 2 , Fig . 1 ) . In detail , three different long dsRNA structures containing three functional siRNA targets , but long RNA chemical synthesis method currently cannot meet our purpose , so the long RNAs were synthesized by T7 polymerase - mediated in vitro transcription ( as shown in Fig . 1 , know - how technology of Biomics Biotechnologies Co . , Ltd ) . To validate the functions of designed multi - target siRNA structures accurately and quickly , we used a dual luciferase reporter ( DLR ) assay based on siQuant method [ 29 ] . The result showed that three designed structures ( mtg _ siR1 , mtg _ siR2 and mtg _ siR3 ) were all have gene silencing efficiencies ( Fig . 3 ) . Then , we screened a HCC cell line ( SMMC - 7721 ) with high expressed NET - 1 , EMS1 and VEGF simultaneously for in - vitro functional study ( Fig . 4 ) . The mRNA and protein levels of NET - 1 , EMS1 and / or VEGF were suppressed by mtg _ siR , NET - 1 _ siR , EMS1 _ siR and VEGF _ siR respectively ( Fig . 4 - 6 ) . And the proliferation gene ( Cyclin D1 ) , motility gene ( Fascin ) and fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) were determined to confirm the inhibition effects of the three genes ( Fig . 7 ) . Furthermore , we demonstrated that the proliferation , migration , invasion and induced apoptosis of HCC cells were inhibited by multi - target siRNA ( mtg _ siR1 ) effectively , and the angiogenesis was also suppressed by it ( Fig . 8 ) . The results of the in - vitro study were demonstrated that the designed multiple targeting siRNA ( mtg _ siR1 ) construct had RNAi activities on knockdown triple genes simultaneously . Moreover , NET - 1 , EMS1 and VEGF gene silencing simultaneously triggered by siRNA was much better than single target siRNA in the inhibition of either NET - 1 , EMS1 or VEGF gene . And , co - silencing of NET - 1 , EMS1 and VEGF could suppress the proliferation , migration , invasion and angiogenesis , while inducing apoptosis of HCC cells in - vitro . The results showed that , multi - target siRNA might be a preferred strategy for multigenic disease therapy for cancers . Also , the result suggested that NET - 1 , EMS1 and VEGF would be effective target genes for HCC therapy .
