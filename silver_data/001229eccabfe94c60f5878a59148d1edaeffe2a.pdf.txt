Cell motility , division , and structural integrity depend on dynamic remodeling of the cellular cytoskeleton , which is regulated in part by actin polymerization and depolymerization . In 3 families , we identified 4 children with recurrent infections and varying clinical manifestations including mild neutropenia , impaired wound healing , severestomatitiswithoralstenosis , anddeath . Allpatientsstudiedhadsimilardistinctive neutrophil herniation of the nuclear lobes and agranular regions within the cytosol . Chemotaxis and chemokinesis were markedly impaired , but staphylococcal killing was normal , and neutrophil oxidative burst was increased both basally and on stimulation . Neutrophilspreadingonglassandcellpolarizationwerealsoimpaired . NeutrophilF - actin waselevatedfourfold , suggestinganabnormalityinF - actinregulation . Two - dimensionaldifferentialin - gelelectrophoresisidentified abnormal actin - interacting protein 1 ( Aip1 ) , encoded by WDR1 , in patient samples . Biallelic mutations in WDR1 affecting distinct antiparallel b - strands of Aip1 were identified in all patients . It has been previously reported that Aip1 regulates cofilin - mediated actin depolymerization , which is required for normal neutrophil function . Heterozygous mutations in clinically normal relatives confirmed that WDR1 deficiency is autosomal recessive . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation corrected the immunologic defect in 1 patient . Mutations in WDR1 affect neutrophil morphology , motility , and function , causing a novel primary immunodeficiency . ( Blood . 2016 ; 128 ( 17 ) : 2135 - 2143 ) Introduction Normal neutrophil function depends on rapid dynamic remodeling of ﬁ lamentous actin . Whereas in muscle cells actin exists predominantly as a ﬁ lamentous polymer ( F - actin ) , in nonmuscle cells , at least half of the actin is retained as a globular monomer ( G - actin ) . A thin submembranous cortical layer of F - actin often maintains structural integrity and regulates exocytosis . 1 , 2 Regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics is complex and depends on a variety of actin binding proteins ; some are involved in promoting F - actin polymerization , whereas others promote severing of actin to shorter actin oligomers or G - actin monomers . Pro ﬁ lin binds 1 : 1 to G - actin , preventing actin polymerization and reserving a pool of monomers for ﬁ lament assembly . 3 In contrast , co ﬁ lin ( actin depolymerizing factor ) binds F - actin and catalyzes the severing of actin ﬁ laments into shorter actin oligomers . 4 , 5 There have been relatively few reports of patients with neutrophil defects involving the actin cytoskeleton . “ Lazy - leukocyte syndrome ” described a condition characterized by recurrent infections , stomatitis , neutropenia , abnormal neutrophil random ( chemokinesis ) and directed ( chemotaxis ) migration , and defective neutrophil mobilization . 6 - 8 Despite clear demonstration of abnormal actin polymerization and impaired chemotaxis , no genetic etiologywasidenti ﬁ ed . Nunoietalidenti ﬁ edapatientwithamutation in b - actin that reduced the binding of pro ﬁ lin to actin , resulting in an immunode ﬁ ciency characterized by reduced neutrophil chemotaxis and superoxide production . These cases con ﬁ rmed that actin dysfunction could cause neutrophil defects of variable clinical expression . 9 Patient II . 2 . 2 in this report was previously 10 described as a child with severe stomatitis who had abnormal chemotaxis and chemokinesis , as well as herniation of neutrophil nuclear lobes ; she died of overwhelming varicella infection at age 8 . 10 Here we describe studies of additional families with life - threatening infections , impaired chemotaxis and chemokinesis , and neutrophil nuclear lobe herniation .

Methods Case reports Family I . Two Qatari sisters from a consanguineous union were re - ferred in 2005 for frequent severe skin and mucosal ulcerations , recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections , and mild neutropenia ( absolute neutrophil counts , 1800 - 2000 / m L in the absence of active infection or granulocyte colony - stimulating factor stimulation ) ( family I ; Figure 1A ) . By age 7 , patient I . 2 . 3 had oral stenosis severe enough to require gastrostomy tube feeding ( Figure 1B ) . Patient 1 . 2 . 3 had multiple infections , including pneumonias with Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus in ﬂ uenzae and urinary tract infection with Escherichia coli and Enterococcus . A twin sister ( patient I . 2 . 4 ) reportedly died of sepsis in Qatar at age 3 following a diarrheal illness . An older sister ( patient 1 . 2 . 2 ) had recurrent cutaneous and pulmonary infections that responded to oral antibiotic therapy directed at gram positives , but no pathogens were identi ﬁ ed . A scalp biopsy from an area of alopecia in 1 . 2 . 2 showed only a chronically in ﬂ amed super ﬁ cial scar . Patient I . 2 . 3 underwent successful stem cell transplantation at age 9 from her unaffected sibling , I . 2 . 1 . Family II . A 7 - year - old girl from a nonconsanguineous union was referred in 1976 ( Figure 1C ) for recurrent infections , neutropenia , and stomatitis ( Figure1D ) , withabnormalneutrophilmorphologyanddefective random and directed locomotion . She had multiple pyogenic infections , including pneumococcalsinusitis , Hin ﬂ uenzae otitismedia , and 3episodes of Streptococcus pneumoniae lobar pneumonia . In addition , pathogenic staphylococciandstreptococciwererepeatedlyculturedfromsmallareasof cutaneous in ﬂ ammation . Recurrent otitis and sinusitis could not be controlled suf ﬁ ciently to prevent hearing loss or oral stenosis . She died at age 8 from disseminated varicella infection . 10 Family III . Two brothers from a nonconsanguineous union were referred in 1986 ( Figure 1E ) with histories of recurrent infections and mild neutropenia . Both had abnormal neutrophil morphology . In 2011 , patient III . 2 . 2 continued to have abnormal neutrophil morphology .

The clinically affected brother , III . 2 . 1 , was not available for genetic study . ( F ) Molecular modeling of human Aip1 based on S cerevisiae Aip1 / UNC78 shows a dual b - propeller , comprised of an N - terminal propeller ( lower ) and a C - terminal propeller ( upper ) . Each propeller consistsof 7 blades , labeled 1 to 7 in the N - terminal propeller and 8 to 14 in the C - terminal peptide . Each blade consists of a twisted b - sheet comprised of 4 antiparallel strands ( A - D ) . The N terminus of the peptide ( shown in blue ) traverses the hinge region and forms the D strand of blade 14 ( shown in red ) , conferring rigidity to the open “clamshell” structure . Each of the mutations identified have been superimposed on the images . 2136 KUHNS et al BLOOD , 27 OCTOBER 2016 x VOLUME 128 , NUMBER 17 For personal use only . on October 27 , 2016 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Assays of neutrophil function Heparinized bloods from both normal subjects and patients were drawn after written consent was obtained under the Frederick Research Donor Program protocolOH99 - C - N046andNationalInstitutesofHealth ( NIH ) protocols99 - CC - 0168and93 - I - 0119 . Neutrophilsandperipheralbloodmononuclearcells ( PBMCs ) were harvested from diluted blood by discontinuous gradient centrifugation ( 500 g for30minutesatroomtemperature ) onacushionofFicoll - Paque ( GEHealthcare ) . PBMCs were harvested from the top of the Ficoll - Paque cushion . The neutrophil - enriched erythrocyte pellet was resuspended with an equal volume of 3 . 0 % dextran ( molecular weight , 300000 ; MP Biomedical ) , and the erythrocytes were sedimented at 1 g for 30 minutes . Remaining contaminating erythrocytes were removedbysequentialhypotoniclysis ( equalvolumesof0 . 2 % salinefollowedby 1 . 6 % saline within 30 seconds to restore isotonicity ) . The ﬁ nal preparation of neutrophils was . 95 % pure with 4 % eosinophils and , 1 % monocytes and lymphocytes as assessed by differential staining . Isolated neutrophils ( 2 . 0 3 10 4 ) were centrifuged onto glass at 100 g in a cytocentrifuge and stained with Diff - Quick ( Harleco , Gibbstown , NJ ) , as were blood smears . For electron micrographs , 2 . 5 3 10 6 cells were pelleted at 300 g and overlayed with 2 % glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer . Cellspreadingwasmonitoredafterisolatedneutrophils ( 20000cells / 20 m L ) were added to a microscope slide , immediately covered with a coverslip , and viewed at 3 1000 . Digital images were captured every 5 seconds for 10 minutes using an In ﬁ nity2 - 1 digital camera ( Lumenera Corp , Ottawa , CA ) attached to a microscope ( Model BX50 ; Olympus Corp , Center Valley , PA ) . Images wereanalyzedusingIn ﬁ nityAnalyzesoftware ( Lumenera Corporation , Ottawa , ON , Canada ) to determine the temporal changes in the perimeter and area of individual cells as they settled and spread on the microscope slide . Formyl - methionyl - leucyl - phenylalanine ( fMLF , 5 3 10 2 9 M ) – induced changes in neutrophil morphology were assessed using the forward and right angle light scattering channels of a BD FACSCanto II Analyzer . Neutrophil chemotaxis was measured using an EZ - TAXIScan ( Effector Cell Institute , Tokyo , Japan ) . Isolated neutrophils ( 1 . 0 m L of 5 3 10 6 / mL ) were added to the “ Cell ” well of the EZ - TAXIScan and 1 . 0 m L of either buffer or fMLF ( 5 3 10 2 8 M ) wasaddedtotheopposing “ Chemoattractant ” well . Digital images of the migrating PMNs were captured every 2 . 5 minutes for 1 hour . ImageswereconvertedtostacksusingtheImageJsoftware ( version1 . 46r ; NIH ) . Tenrandomly selectedcellswereelectronicallytracedusingthe ImageJplug - in , MTrackJ . The paths of the migratingcells were plotted with the position of each cellat t 5 0anchoredattheorigin . Usingthecoordinatesoftheindividualcellsin each image , the distance that each cell migrated and the average velocity were calculated using the distance formula . Superoxide production was measured by the superoxide dismutase - inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c . Neutrophils , suspended in Hanks balancedsaltsolution ( HBSS ; 1 3 10 6 / mL ) containing100 m Mferricytochrome c , wereincubatedat37°Cfor15minutesinthepresenceofbuffer ( basal ) , fMLF ( 10 2 7 M ) , phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) ( 100 ng / mL ) , cytochalasin B ( 5 m g / mL ) , opsonized zymosan ( 1 mg / mL ) , or the combination of cytochalasin B 1 opsonizedzymosan . The reaction was stopped at4°C , andthe supernatant ﬂ uid was harvested after centrifuging . An identically treated tube containing superoxide dismutase ( 100 m g / mL ) served as the blank for each set of conditions . The reduction of ferricytochrome c was assayed with an analytic wavelengthof549 . 5nmandbackgroundwavelengthsattheisosbesticpoints of 541 and 556 nm . The data were converted to nanomoles of O (cid:129) 2 2 = 10 6 cells using a micromolar extinction coef ﬁ cient of 0 . 0211 . The staphylococcidal activity of neutrophils , suspended at5 3 10 6 cells / mL in HBSS with divalent cations and 10 % fresh frozen AB serum , was assessed using S aureus strain 502A at target : effector ratios of 2 : 1 and 8 : 1 . After incubating 20 , 45 , and 90 minutes , the surviving bacteria in the cell suspension wereculturedonagarpourplates . Colony - formingunitswereenumeratedusing Image - Pro Plus ( MediaCybernetics , Bethesda , MD ) . Neutrophil adherencewasdetermined as binding ofcalcein acetomethoxy - loaded ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) neutrophils to plastic after stimulation withphorbolmyristateacetate ( 100 ng / mL ; Sigma - AldrichCorp , St Louis , MO ) using a ﬂ uorescence microplate reader ( Gemini EM ; Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Neutrophildegranulationwasassessedbystimulationfor15minutesat37° with either PMA ( 100 ng / mL ) or with fMLF ( 0 . 1 m M ) plus cytochalasin B ( 5 m g / mL ) . The levels of lactoferrin , gelatinase ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) , and myeloperoxidase ( MesoScale Discovery , Gaithersburg , MD ) in the extracellular ﬂ uids and the cell pellets were determined with commercial enzyme - linked immunoassays according to manufacturers ’ instructions . To visualize F - actin by confocal microscopy ( LSM510 ; Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) , neutrophils ( 2 . 0 3 10 4 ) were dried onto glass slides , permeabilized with0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 , andstainedwith5unitsAlexaFluor546phalloidin ( Life Technologies ) . Slideswerecounterstainedwiththenuclearstain , 4 ’ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( 0 . 1 m g / mL ) . Alternatively , neutrophils ( 1 . 0 3 10 6 / mL ) were incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde , 1 . 25 U / mL Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin , and 100 m g / mL lysophosphatidylcholine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , washed , and analyzed on a BD FACSCanto II Analyzer ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) .

Protein was measured using Bio - Rad assay . For eachsample , 30 m gprotein wasmixedwith1 . 0 m LdilutedCyDyeand kept in the dark on ice for 30 minutes . One microliter 10 mM lysine was added to eachsampleandincubatedinthedarkoniceforanadditional15minutestostopthe reaction . Each Cy3 - labeled patient sample was mixed with a Cy5 - labeled normal sample . Proteins were ﬁ rst resolved by isoelectric focusing , followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) orthogonally . Theresultinggelwasimagedforboth ﬂ uorescentdyes , andtherelativeexpression ( ratio of the Cy dyes ) of each protein spot was determined . Protein spots that were differentiallyexpressedinbothpatientsamplescomparedwiththenormalsamples ( signi ﬁ cance criterion of P , . 1 ) were selected for identi ﬁ cation by mass spec - trometry ( Applied Biomics , Hayward , CA ) . Additional details of the methods are included in the supplemental Data , available on the Blood Web site . Immunoblot analysis Differential expression of neutrophil proteins was con ﬁ rmed by electrophoresis of 75 m g neutrophil lysate on a 7 . 5 % Bis - Tris SDS - PAGE gel , transfer to nitrocellulose , and probing with antibodies to co ﬁ lin ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) , phospho - co ﬁ lin ( Ser3 ) ( CellSignalingTechnology , Danvers , MA ) , WDR1 / Aip1 ( Novus Biologicals , Littleton , CO ) , and actin ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) .

Results PeripheralbloodsmearsfromthepatientsinfamilyIrepeatedlyshowed neutrophil cytosolic regions devoid of granules ( Figure 2 , column A ) . Isolated neutrophils spread on glass showed distinctive herniation of nuclear lobes in 40 % to60 % of the cells ( Figure 2 , column B ) .

Transmission electron micrographs con ﬁ rmed the herniation of upto3nuclearlobesinbothneutrophilsandeosinophils , withretraction of cytoplasmic granules into the central region of the cells ( Figure 2 , column C ) . A thin region of cytosol and plasma membrane surrounded the herniated nuclear lobes , con ﬁ rming their contiguity with the parent BLOOD , 27 OCTOBER 2016 x VOLUME 128 , NUMBER 17 WDR1 DEFICIENCY AND NEUTROPHIL DYSFUNCTION 2137 For personal use only . on October 27 , 2016 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From cell . Under basal conditions , normal neutrophils were spherical by scanning electron microscopy ( Figure 2 , column D ) , whereas patient neutrophils exhibited knob - like structures , presumed to be nuclear lobes . Treatment of neutrophils with the chemoattractant fMLF for 30 minutes normally induces cytoskeletal reorganization , leading to neutrophil polarization with a lamellipod on the leading edge and restrictionofgranulesandnuclearlobestothetrailinguropod ( Figure2 , column E ) . Neutrophil polarization and ruf ﬂ ing of the lamellipod were tracked temporally using the forward and right angle light scattering channels of a ﬂ ow cytometer ( Figure 3A ) . Patient neutrophils failed to polarize normally ( Figures 2 , column E , and 3A ) . In addition , neutrophils from patient I . 2 . 3 failed to spread on glass normally ( supplemental Movie 1 ) compared with a normal subject . Using image analysis to determine the temporal changes in the area of each cell , neutrophilsfromnormalsubjectsspreadingonglassexhibitedagreaterthantwofoldincreaseinarea ; neutrophils from patient I . 2 . 3 and patient III . 2 . 2 exhibited abnormal spreading on glass that was signi ﬁ cantly different compared with neutrophils from normal subjects ( supple - mental Figure 1A - B ) . The neutrophils of patients I . 2 . 2 and I . 2 . 3 had increased spontaneous and fMLF - and opsonized zymosan - stimulated superox - ide production ( supplemental Figure 2 ) as shown previously for patient II . 2 . 2 . 10 However , PMA - stimulated superoxide production was normal . Cytochalasin B is thought to bind to the barbed end of F - actinandpreventmonomeraddition , promotingdepolymerizationof F - actin . 11 In normal neutrophils , cytochalasin B ampli ﬁ es opsonized zymosan - induced superoxide production . 12 However , patient neutro - phils showed negligible superoxide augmentation with cytochalasin B , suggesting that their basal state mimicked that induced by cytochalasin B and re ﬂ ected an underlying defect in actin kinetics ( supplemental Figure 2 ) . Total granule content of lactoferrin , myeloperoxidase , and gelatinase in patient neutrophils was normal , as was their release in response to PMA and fMLF 1 cytochalasin B ( not shown ) . Patient neutrophilskilled Saureus normallyat20and45minutes , butexhibited a slight defect at 90 minutes regardless of multiplicity of infection ( supplemental Figure 3 ) . Neutrophil migration requires rapid rearrangement of actin . Tracking the movement of equal numbers of individual cells ( EZ - TAXIScan ) showed profoundly impaired random and fMLF - directed migration of neutrophils from patients I . 2 . 2 and I . 2 . 3 ( Figure 3B - C ) . Actin in the resting neutrophil was stained with Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin , a ﬂ uorescent probe that preferentially binds F - actin . Confocal microscopy showed that 50 % to 90 % of patient cells had increased phalloidin staining , indicating increased F - actin ( Figure 4A ) . Taken together , these data indicated an abnormality in the abundance and localization of F - actin . Importantly , herniation of nuclear lobes colocalizedwith increasedF - actinstaining . Normalneutrophilsstained with Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin by ﬂ ow cytometry showed only a single population of neutrophils ( Figure 4A - B ) . Incontrast , neutrophils from patients I . 2 . 2 and I . 2 . 3 showed only minor populations with normal phalloidin staining , whereas the majority of cells ( ; 85 % ) had fourfold more phalloidin staining than normal neutrophils ( 3520 and 3240 AU for patients I . 2 . 2 and I . 2 . 3 , respectively , compared with 830 AU for the normal ) , con ﬁ rming that patients had increased levels of F - actin ( Figure 4B ) . Because the disease phenotype was transmitted in a recessive pattern and appeared to be in neutrophil cytosol , we chose a proteomic approach searching for abnormal or missing proteins in our patients . Normal and patient neutrophil lysates were labeled and examined by 2D differential in - gel electrophoresis ( Figure 5A - B ) . Thirty - one proteins were differentially detected in patient neutrophil lysates compared with normals ( Figure 5C ) including 5 b - actin variants , suggesting differential regulation of posttranslational modi ﬁ cations of actin in patient neutrophils . Two spots were identi ﬁ ed as co ﬁ lin ( one being more acidic and less abundant and the other more basic and abundant in patient neutrophils ) . However , total patient co ﬁ lin levels were normal ( Figure 5D ) , suggesting that co ﬁ lin was differentially regulated by posttranslational modi ﬁ cations . Co ﬁ lin activity is regulated by LIM kinase - mediated phosphory - lation at Ser3 , which disrupts the F - actin binding domain , resulting in decreased actin depolymerization . Using a phospho - speci ﬁ c Ser3 - co ﬁ lin antibody , substantial phosphorylation of co ﬁ lin was observed in normal neutrophil lysates , whereas patient co ﬁ lin was largely unphosphorylated , suggesting increased co ﬁ lin - mediated depolymer - ization activity ( Figure 5D , lanes 4 and 5 ) . Although the differential expression of co ﬁ lin might have a profound impact on the neutrophil cytoskeleton , neutrophils from patient III . 2 . 2 had normal phosphory - lation of co ﬁ lin , suggesting that this was not the critical protein ( Figure 5D , lane 7 ) . Three spots identi ﬁ ed as Aip1 ( Figure 5A - C ) were differentially expressed in patient neutrophil lysates .

The unaffected parents , maternal uncle , and brother were heterozygous ( supplemental Figure 4A ) . Aip1 was the ﬁ rst single protein recognized with 2 b - propellers , each consisting of 7 blades of a b - sheet formed by 4 antiparallel b - strands ( denoted A , B , C , and D radially outward ; Figure 1F ) . 13 D26N lies in a highly conserved region of strand A of blade1oftheN - terminal b - propeller ( homologymodeledhumanAip1 basedon Caenorhabditiselegans Aip1 / UNC - 78 ( ProteinDataBankID code 1NRO ; 39 % homology ) . 14 Because of clinical phenotypic similarity , DNA was obtained from members of families II and III .

Both mutations were in the N - terminal b propeller . All 5 identi ﬁ ed mutations fell within structurally invariant b - strand regions of the blades , predicting disruption of Aip1 function . Discussion The actincytoskeleton is required for the structural integrity of all cells . However , motile cells such as neutrophils require rapid and directional actin remodeling . Adherence to and spreading on endothelium and migration through the endothelium into tissue require morphologic changes that depend on the dynamic polymerization and depolymer - ization of cytoskeletal actin . These changes necessarily alter the movementofintracellularorganellesaswellastheoverall ﬂ uidityofthe cytosol ( gel ↔ sol transformations ) ( Figure 6 ) .

BLOOD , 27 OCTOBER 2016 x VOLUME 128 , NUMBER 17 WDR1 DEFICIENCY AND NEUTROPHIL DYSFUNCTION 2141 For personal use only . on October 27 , 2016 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From processesthatrequirerapidactinturnover , suchaslamellipodformation in migrating cells . Aip1 is thought to enhance the ef ﬁ ciency of co ﬁ lin , promoting the complete depolymerization of F - actin oligomers to monomeric actin . Although it has little severing activity on its own , Aip1 regulates co ﬁ lin by enhancing the depolymerization of F - actin to monomeric G - actin rather than to short oligomers . 15 More recent ﬁ ndings suggest that Aip1 forms a ternary complex with co ﬁ lin and F - actin that destabilizes actin – actin monomer interactions , resulting in therapiddisassemblyofactin ﬁ laments . 16 KnockdownofAip1leadsto abnormalandasymmetricaccumulationofthickeractin ﬁ lamentsatthe contractile ring in late telophase , disrupting normal cytokinesis and promoting multinucleate cells , a phenotype corrected by a constitu - tively active ( Ser3 . Ala ) co ﬁ lin . 15 Aip1 is a dual b - propeller that consists of 11 WD repeats , a motif thatgenerallyconsistsof ; 40aminoacidsbracketedbytheaminoacid pairsGly - HisontheaminoendandTrp - Asp ( WD ) onthecarboxylend . Each propeller has 7 blades , and each blade consists of a small antiparallel b - sheet with 4 antiparallel b - strands . Most interspecies structural divergence in Aip1 resides in the loops connecting the b - strands , and not in the b - strands themselves , suggesting that those regions are less tolerant of variation . Each WD repeat comprises a singlepropellerblade ; theremaining3bladesdonotcontainWDrepeat domains but still generate similar structural elements . Based on the crystal structure of yeast Aip1 , 13 there are dense patches of conserved residues on the surface of the N - terminal propeller and at the interface of the 2 propellers . Because the amino terminus forms the D strand of blade 7 of the C - terminal b - propeller , the polypeptide chain traverses theinterfacetwice ( aminoacids10 - 20and337 - 341 ) , conferringrigidity to the hinge region , resulting in an open clamshell shape ( angle 115° ; Figure 1F ) . Complete Aip1 de ﬁ ciency is lethal during embryogenesis . 17 However , the redears ( rd ) mouse has a single base mutation forming a cryptic splice site that results in a 6 - base in - frame deletion and a loss of amino acids 346 - 347 in b - strand C of blade 8 of the C - terminal b - propeller . This mutation reduces Aip1 expression by 70 % to 80 % and manifests as macrothrombocytopenia and neutrophilia with in ﬂ ammatory lesions of the ears , feet , and tail . 17 Platelets and megakaryocytes are abnormal with large cytosolic regions devoid of granules , organelles , and membranes . The in ﬂ amed lesions are neu - trophilic with necrosis and have been characterized as autoin ﬂ amma - tory . Redears neutrophils had impaired chemotaxis in vitro , elevated F - actin , and decreased depolymerization of F - actin in response to the chemokine , Mip - 2 . It remains unclear whether the redears lesions were autoin ﬂ ammatory or due to infections with resident skin ﬂ ora . Persistence of these lesions even on a T cell – de ﬁ cient background does not exclude a critical role for neutrophil function . Recently , Kim et al suggested that autoin ﬂ ammatory disease in the redears mouse was mediated by increased levels of plasma interleukin - 18 ( IL - 18 ) thought to be produced by in ﬂ ammatory monocytes . 18 However , that physiology may not directly apply to Pts I . 2 . 2 and I . 2 . 3 because neither patient exhibited persistently elevated levels of IL - 18 , nor did lipopolysaccharide stimulation of patient PBMCs show exaggerated IL - 18 production ( data not shown ) . Moreover , the redears mouse exhibited neutrophilia , whereas the patients described here exhibited mild neutropenia . We identi ﬁ ed 5 disease alleles in 3 families leading to an overall similar clinical and laboratory phenotype : abnormal neutrophil morphology and function , mild neutropenia , recurrent bacterial in - fections , and , in some case , severe stomatitis , severe varicella zoster virus infection , and premature death . We saw no evidence of a heterozygous phenotype , con ﬁ rming this as a true recessive disease . The mutation in family I , D26N , was easy to demonstrate in the probands . WewereforcedtoinferthemutationsinpatientII . 2 . 2 , aswe had no patient DNA for sequencing . However , the identi ﬁ cation of distinct deleterious heterozygous mutations in her parents ( mother , V424M ; father , delK7 ) and V424M in a sibling and niece strongly suggest that mutated WDR1 was in fact the gene responsible for her illness and demise . In family III , we identi ﬁ ed compound heterozy - gous mutations L286V and G121R . All mutations occurred at highly conserved amino acids located within invariant antiparallel b - strands that constitute the blades of the b - propeller of Aip1 . Cofilin Wild type Aip1 G - actin F - actin Mutant Aip1 A B Figure 6 . Proposed consequence of mutated Aip1 . Neutrophil migration and spreading requires dynamic polymerization / depolymerization of the cytoskeletal actin , altering the fluidity of the cytosol ( gel ↔ sol transformations ) and promoting changes in cellular morphology . Aip1 is thought to bind to cofilin and enhance its actin depolymerizing activity . Mutations affecting Aip1 either disrupt its interactions with cofilin ( failure to enhance its activity ) , promoting the accumulation of F - actin and disrupting the cytoskeletal organization of the cytosol . 2142 KUHNS et al BLOOD , 27 OCTOBER 2016 x VOLUME 128 , NUMBER 17 For personal use only . on October 27 , 2016 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Mutated Aip1 protein levels in patient neutrophil lysates were comparable to Aip1 protein levels in normal neutrophil lysates ( ; 60 - 70 % of normal and similar to an unaffected heterozygous sibling ; Figure 5D , lane 6 ) , as were the levels of co ﬁ lin . However , in family I , Ser3 phospho - co ﬁ lin was markedly reduced in the 2D gels . Phosphorylation of co ﬁ lin at Ser3 downregulates its actin - severing activity by disrupting the F - actin binding site . Therefore , co ﬁ lin in patient cells was constitutively active compared with co ﬁ lin in normal neutrophils However , this was not a consistent ﬁ nding among patientswith mutationsin WDR1 ( Figure5D , lane 7 ) . Despite a dramatic reduction in phosphorylation of Ser3 in these patients ( with an expected increase in actin severing activity ) , neutrophils from both patients exhibited a two - to threefold increase in F - actin in their neutrophils . This underscores a previously unknown and critical role for Aip1 in actin disassembly . The abnormal Aip1 encountered in this disease appears unable to regulate co ﬁ lin activ - ity normally , resulting in accumulation of perhaps shorter F - actin oligomers while concurrently expressing highly active actin - severing activity ( Figure 5D ) . Efforts to rescue defective Aip1 in patient ﬁ broblasts proved unsuccessful . Only limited additional expression of Aip1 was tolerated in normal ﬁ broblasts ; over - expression of Aip1 reduced cellular viability . We hypothesize that patient ﬁ broblasts could not attain suf ﬁ cient wild - type Aip1 expression to overcome the mutant protein expression without reducing cellular viability . These mutations in WDR1 clearly separate the critical roles of Aip1 in neutrophils ( and perhaps other leukocytes ) from its roles in other cells . Overall growth and development of these patients was normal , suggesting that the function of Aip1 affected is most important for the rapid remodeling of the cytoskeleton that is intrinsic to leukocyte function , but apparently less critical for other cellular activities . This novel autosomal recessive immunode ﬁ - ciency identi ﬁ es a previously unappreciated role for Aip1 in cell biology , neutrophil function , and host defense .
