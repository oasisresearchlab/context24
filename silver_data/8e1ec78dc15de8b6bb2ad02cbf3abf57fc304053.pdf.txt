This study investigated the neuroanatomical basis of the association between EI and TC which measured by the Schutte self - report EI scale and the Williams creativity aptitude test . First , the voxel - based morphometry ( VBM ) analysis was used to explore the brain structures which is closely related to EI in a large young sample ( n = 213 ) . The results showed that EI was positively correlated with the regional gray matter volume ( rGMV ) in the right orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) , which is regarded as a key region of emotional processing . More importantly , further mediation analysis revealed that rGMV in the right OFC partially mediated the association between EI and TC , which showed the OFC volume could account for the relationship between EI and TC . These ﬁndings conﬁrmed the close relationship between EI and TC , and highlighted that the brain volumetric variation in the OFC associated with the top - down processing of emotion regulation , which may play a critical role in the promotion of TC . Together , these ﬁndings contributed to sharpening the understanding of the complex relationship between EI and TC from the perspective of brain structural basis . Keywords : emotional intelligence , trait creativity , orbitofrontal cortex , gray matter volume , voxel - based morphometry INTRODUCTION Emotional intelligence ( EI ) refers to the ability to reason and analyze emotions accurately , as well as utilize emotions and emotional knowledge to enhance thought and action ( Mayer et al . , 2008 ) , which also reﬂects individual’s ability to perceive , regulate , and utilize emotion ( Salovey and Mayer , 1990 ) . Individuals with high EI are more likely to gain more beneﬁcial outcomes ( Parke et al . , 2015 ) , such as closer relationship ( Brackett et al . , 2006 ) , better social problem solving ( Barbey et al . , 2014 ) , higher well - being and life satisfaction ( Kong and Zhao , 2013 ) , better work performance and higher academic achievement ( Rivers et al . , 2012 ; Libbrecht et al . , 2014 ) . On the contrary , the deﬁciency of EI always pose a threat to mental and body health , which may cause psychological distress ( Hertel et al . , 2009 ) , gaming and Internet abuse ( Parker et al . , 2013 ) , anxiety and depression ( Salguero et al . , 2012 ; Zavala and Lopez , 2012 ) .

Emotional Intelligence and Creativity Emerging neuroscience studies have revealed that several emotion - related regions may correlate with EI , such as the anterior insula ( AI ) , amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) , anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , and ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC ) ( Frith and Frith , 2007 ; Blakemore , 2008 ; Krueger et al . , 2009 ; Kreifelts et al . , 2010 ; Koven et al . , 2011 ; Takeuchi et al . , 2011 , 2013a , b ; Pan et al . , 2014 ; Tan et al . , 2014 ; Hogeveen et al . , 2016b ) . The AI and ACC have been regarded to play a critical in the generating of emotional awareness , an important ability to perceive feelings of oneself ( Medford and Critchley , 2010 ; Hogeveen et al . , 2016a ) . For the ability to understand other’s emotions , some evidence showed that the amygdala and the vmPFC may aim to ensure the recognition of facial expressions ( Vuilleumier et al . , 2004 ; Wolf et al . , 2014 ) . The OFC has been regarded as a core region of emotional assessment and emotional regulation , especially which adjusts emotional expression by reasonably evaluating the emotional salient stimuli and regulating the subjective emotional experience ( Kringelbach , 2005 ; Roelofs et al . , 2009 ) . Prior studies also found the OFC is associated with inhibitory control , which may help to regulate negative emotion eﬀectively , reduce maladaptive behavior , and enhance behavior ﬂexibility ( Roberts and Wallis , 2000 ; Rudebeck et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , studies on human brain lesion further conﬁrmed several brain regions related to individual’s emotional ability . Patients with substantial lesion in the AI exhibited signiﬁcantly higher levels of alexithymia ( Hogeveen et al . , 2016a ) . Alexithymia can be characterized by dysfunction in emotional awareness , social interaction , and interpersonal relationship ( Bagby et al . , 1994 ) , which was negatively correlated with EI ( Baughman et al . , 2013 ; Onur et al . , 2013 ) . Other research showed that patients with damages in the OFC exhibit lower EI score and behaved handicaps in emotional regulation compared with the healthy group , which signiﬁcantly impaired subjective emotional experience and adaptive behavior ( Bar - On et al . , 2003 ; Beer et al . , 2003 ; Hornak et al . , 2003 ; Krueger et al . , 2009 ; Hogeveen et al . , 2016b ) . At the extremes , the damage or dysfunction in the OFC may result in ‘acquired sociopathic’ behavior ( Saver and Damasio , 1991 ) . Combining the above studies , it is obvious that EI plays an important role in emotional processing , interpersonal communication , academic achievement , work performance and so on , which reveals the ability to perceive , regulate , and utilize the emotions of oneself and others is vital for daily life . As an extremely important human activity , creative behavior would be aﬀected by emotion as well ( Higgins et al . , 1992 ; Fong , 2006 ; Hoﬀmann and Russ , 2012 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ; Ding et al . , 2014 ; Hao et al . , 2017 ) , while previous studies also showed a signiﬁcant positive correlation between EI and creativity ( Guastello et al . , 2004 ; Barczak et al . , 2010 ; Carmeli et al . , 2014 ; Parke et al . , 2015 ; Sahin et al . , 2016 ; Toyama and Mauno , 2017 ) . For example , Barczak et al . ( 2010 ) investigated the inﬂuence of team EI on team creativity in a young sample . They found team EI enhanced team creativity by promoting team trust and developing a collaborative culture of the team . Researchers also investigated the impact of EI on creativity in workplace , Carmeli et al . ( 2014 ) found that employees with higher EI tend to exhibit a higher level of generosity , which fosters a sense of vigor , and further results in the enhancement of creativity . In addition , based on the aﬀective information processing theory , a recent study showed that the emotional regulation of EI allows employees to keep more positive aﬀect when facing a complex problem situation , and the emotional facilitation of EI enables employees to utilize positive aﬀect to promote creativity ( Parke et al . , 2015 ) . Guastello et al . ( 2004 ) investigated the relationships among EI , mood disorders , and creativity , results showed that EI and creativity were higher among people with mood disorders who completed treatment relative to people in treatment , which means EI may improve creativity by oﬀsetting emotional disorders and maintaining positive aﬀect ( Guastello et al . , 2004 ) . The above ﬁndings revealed a positive eﬀect of EI on creativity . As we know , numerous outstanding creators like Albert Einstein always possess great creative potential that makes them unique and acquires more creative achievements . Creative potential can be regarded as a multidimensional composite consists of some aspects related to cognition and others related to personality ( Gough , 1979 ; Piﬀer , 2012 ; Li et al . , 2015 ; Silvia et al . , 2016 ) . Creative cognition refers to the cognitive processes that occur in the generation and evaluation of creative ideas and products , such as divergent thinking , whereas creative traits might be a series of aptitude or personality variables ( e . g . , curiosity , openness to experience , and imagination ) that also could integrate other factors such as psychopathological traits and genetic impacts ( Zeng et al . , 2009 ; Piﬀer , 2012 ; Li et al . , 2015 ; Zhuang et al . , 2017 ) . In line with precious studies ( Li et al . , 2015 ; Zhuang et al . , 2017 ) , we focused on personality or aptitude aspects of the creative trait that usually assessed using the Williams creativity aptitude test ( WCAT ) . These aptitudes ( trait creativity , TC ) have a positive impact on creative thinking and creative problem solving ( Sternberg , 1999 ) . Prior study also suggested that TC acts as a valid predictor of creative achievement in real life ( Feist and Barron , 2003 ) . Most existing studies , however , have only focused on the association between EI and creative cognition , ignoring the association between EI and TC , as well as the brain structure bases which involves . Thus , the present study aimed to investigate the association between EI and TC , and elucidates the brain neural substrates between them in a large young sample . A recent voxel - based morphometry ( VBM ) study revealed that TC ( as measured by WCAT ) was associated with emotion - related brain structures , such as the regional gray matter volume ( rGMV ) of the OFC , hippocampus , and amygdala ( Zhuang et al . , 2017 ) , while these regions are closely related to emotional processing . Intriguingly , another brain structure study also found that EI displayed a close correlation with the rGMV in the insula , OFC , and the parahippocampal gyrus ( Tan et al . , 2014 ) . These similar brain regions involved in EI and TC suggest that they may share a common brain structure basis . Moreover , individuals with higher EI who exhibit more excellent ability of emotional processing and tend to be critical thinkers ( Yao et al . , 2017 ) , which may help to creative problem solving ( Eggers et al . , 2017 ) . Taken together , the above ﬁndings may reveal a close relationship between EI and TC , and the underlying similar brain structures that they both involved . However , to our knowledge , there is no direct evidence have clariﬁed the complex association Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 2 June 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 925 fpsyg - 09 - 00925 June 13 , 2018 Time : 16 : 11 # 3 He et al . Emotional Intelligence and Creativity between them . In this study , we examined the association between EI and TC , as measured by the Schutte Self - Report Emotional Intelligence Scale and WCAT , respectively . Then , the VBM analysis was used to identify the rGMV related to EI at the whole - brain level . Considering EI refers to a set of emotional abilities ( e . g . , emotional regulation , utilization of emotions , appraisal of emotions and so on ) , we hypothesized that EI would be closely associated with the rGMV in emotion - related areas such as the OFC , ACC , and the amygdala . Furthermore , we conducted a mediation analysis to explore whether brain structures could account for the association between EI and TC , because EI and TC may share similar brain structure bases ( Tan et al . , 2014 ; Zhuang et al . , 2017 ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants A total of 225 right - handed , healthy subjects from the Southwest University in China participated in the study as part of our ongoing project to examine the associations between brain , creativity , and mental health . Seven subjects were excluded because of incomplete behavior data , and ﬁve participants were excluded due to extraordinary motion artifacts . Therefore , 213 participants were included in analyses ( 103 males and 110 females ; mean age = 20 . 0 ± 1 . 3 ; ranged from 17 to 27 ) . Based on a self - report questionnaire survey before the scan , none of them had a history of psychiatric or neurological illness , or substance abuse . This study was granted by the Institutional Review Board of Southwest University Imaging Center for Brain Research , and all participants signed the written informed consents . Emotional Intelligence Scale The Schutte Self - Report Emotional Intelligence Scale ( SSREIS ) is an eﬀective self - report EI assessment that developed by Schutte et al . ( 1998 ) . The SSREIS in Chinese version has been widely used in Chinese populations and includes four dimensions : regulation of emotions , utilization of emotions , self - emotion appraisal , and others’ emotion appraisal ( Wang , 2002 ) . Each item was used a ﬁve - point scale ranging from “not true of me” to “very often true of me . ” The total score is calculated by adding the answers of all the items , which represents the level of EI . The Cronbach’s α in the present study was 0 . 79 . Williams Creativity Aptitude Test Trait creativity was measured by the WCAT , which is part of the creativity assessment packet ( Williams , 1980 ) . The Chinese version developed by Lin and Wang ( 1994 ) , which consists of 50 items and contains four domains : challenge , imagination , curiosity , and risk - taking . Participants were instructed to rate the extent to which they agree or disagree with each item using a six - point Likert scale . The total score was calculated by adding the answers of all the items . The higher score individuals have , the greater aptitude for creativity they exhibit . This scale showed a good reliability and validity in prior studies ( Lin and Wang , 1994 ; Hwang et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2015 ) . The Cronbach’s α in the present study was 0 . 79 . General Intelligence In order to dispel the impact of general intelligence on EI and creativity , the Chinese version of the Combined Raven’s Test - Rural ( CRT - RC3 ) was used to measure individuals’ general intelligence . The CRT - RC3 contains the Raven’s colored progressive matrix ( A , B , and AB sets ) and Raven’s standard progressive matrix ( C , D , and E sets ) , which consist of 72 non - verbal items and each item requires participants to select the best answer from six or eight alternatives to complete the missing matrix . This scale has been widely used in Chinese populations and previous researches have reported that this test exhibits a good degree of reliability and validity in measuring general intelligence ( Wang , 2007 ) . Magnetic Resonance Image Data Acquisition Imaging data were collected by using a 12 - channel head coil on a Siemens 3 T Trio scanner ( Siemens Medical Systems , Erlangen , Germany ) . High - resolution T1 - weighted structural images were acquired with a magnetization - prepared rapid gradient echo ( MPRAGE ) sequence : TR = 1900 ms ; TE = 2 . 52 ms ; ﬂip angle = 9 ◦ ; FOV = 256 mm × 256 mm ; slices = 176 ; thickness = 1 . 0 mm ; voxel size = 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm . Voxel - Based Morphometry Analysis The MR images were processed with the VBM toolbox using SPM8 1 implemented in MATLAB R2010a ( Math Works Inc . , Natick , MA , United States ) . Firstly , all images from each subject were displayed in SPM8 to screen for artifacts or gross anatomical abnormalities . In the process of registration , the MR images were manually reoriented to the anterior commissure to enhance registration . Then , the MR images were segmented into gray matter , white matter , and cerebrospinal ﬂuid by using the new segmentation toolbox in SPM8 . Subsequently , we performed DARTEL for registration , normalization , and modulation ( Ashburner , 2007 ) . To ensure that regional diﬀerences in the total amount of gray matter were conserved , the image intensity of each voxel was modulated by Jacobian determinants derived from spatial normalization ( Good et al . , 2001 ) . Additionally , the registered images were transformed to MNI space . Finally , in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , an 8 - mm full - width at half - maximum ( FWHM ) Gaussian kernel was used to smooth the modulated images . Statistical Analysis Voxel - based morphometry analysis was performed in SPM8 . We used multiple linear regression analysis at the whole - brain level to determine whether the rGMV was associated with individual diﬀerences in EI score . In order to eliminate the potential eﬀects of possible confound variables , gender , age , general intelligence , and total GMV were controlled as no interest variables . An absolute threshold masking of 0 . 2 was used to minimize the boundary eﬀects between gray matter and white matter , which means signal intensity values of voxels with gray matter lower 1 www . ﬁl . ion . ucl . ac . uk / spm Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 3 June 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 925 fpsyg - 09 - 00925 June 13 , 2018 Time : 16 : 11 # 4 He et al . Emotional Intelligence and Creativity than 0 . 2 were removed from the analysis . The voxel - level family - wise error ( FWE ) method was used at the whole - brain level , and the signiﬁcance threshold was set at p < 0 . 05 , corrected for multiple comparisons . Mediation Analysis To examine whether the speciﬁc rGMV could explain the association between EI and TC , mediation analysis was performed by using SPSS macro with 0 . 95 conﬁdence level and 5000 bootstrap sample ( Preacher and Hayes , 2004 , 2008 ) . The total eﬀect of EI on TC ( path c ) consists of two parts , namely , the direct eﬀect of EI on TC after controlling for the rGMV of the right OFC ( path c’ ) and the indirect eﬀect of EI on TC through the OFC volume ( path a × b ) . The mediation analysis aims to evaluate whether the indirect eﬀect is signiﬁcant . If the conﬁdence interval ( CI ) does not include zero , which means the rGMV of the OFC mediated the association between EI and TC . In addition , gender , age , general intelligence , and total GMV were controlled as covariates in the model . RESULTS Behavioral Results The average , standard deviation , and Person correlation of all variables for this sample are presented in Table 1 . The statistical software SPSS 22 . 0 was used to analyze all behavioral data , and the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient of EI and TC was calculated by controlling for gender , age , and general intelligence . As indicated in Table 1 , there were weakly but signiﬁcantly positive correlations between the subscale scores of the SSREIS and the subscale scores of the WCAT . In addition , the results also showed that the total score of the SSREIS was strongly and signiﬁcantly positively associated with the total score of the WCAT ( r = 0 . 42 , p < 0 . 001 ) , which revealed a close relationship between EI and TC . VBM Results This study investigated the relationship between the rGMV and individual diﬀerence in EI ( measured by SSREIS ) at the whole - brain level . In order to eliminate the potential eﬀects of possible confound variables , gender , age , general intelligence , and total GMV were controlled as no interest covariates and regressed out . At the whole - brain level , multiple regression analysis revealed a positive relationship between total score of the SSREIS and the rGMV in the right OFC ( Brodmann area : 11 ; MNI coordinate : 30 , 36 , − 12 ; cluster size = 95 ; r = 0 . 33 ; t = 5 . 40 ; p = 0 . 001 , FWE corrected ; see Figure 1 ) . There was no signiﬁcant negative correlation between total score of the SSREIS and any other brain regions ( p > 0 . 05 , FWE corrected ) , subscale scores of the SSREIS also showed an insigniﬁcant correlation with any other brain regions as well ( p > 0 . 05 , FWE corrected ) . After identifying potential neural correlations of EI , we used the right OFC that is signiﬁcantly correlated with EI from the VBM analysis to further examined the relationship between WCAT and OFC , the mean gray matter volume extracted by using the REX toolbox developed by the LKM T A B L E 1 | T h e m ea n s , s t a n d a r d d e v i a t i o n s , a n d c o rr e l a t i o n s o f s c o r e s o n SS R E I S a n d W C A T ( n = 213 ) .

Emotional Intelligence and Creativity FIGURE 1 | Brain regions of positive correlation between GMV and EI . ( A ) The right OFC exhibited signiﬁcant positive correlation with total score of EI as measured by the SSREIS ( shown at t > 3 for visualization purposes ) , gender , age , general intelligence and total GMV were regressed out . ( B ) Scatter plots showed the correlation between EI and rGMV in the right OFC ( r = 0 . 33 , p < 0 . 001 ) . experts 2 . Correlation analysis showed that rGMV in the OFC was positively correlated with imagination ( r = 0 . 13 ; p = 0 . 05 ) , curiosity ( r = 0 . 24 ; p < 0 . 001 ) , challenge ( r = 0 . 28 ; p < 0 . 01 ) , risk - taking ( r = 0 . 30 ; p < 0 . 001 ) , and TC total score ( r = 0 . 32 ; p < 0 . 001 ) as measured by WCAT . After controlling gender , age , and Raven’s score , the correlation results stood robust ( imagination , r = 0 . 12 , p > 0 . 05 ; curiosity , r = 0 . 20 , p = 0 . 005 ; challenge , r = 0 . 22 , p = 0 . 001 ; risk - taking , r = 0 . 26 , p < 0 . 001 ; TC total score , r = 0 . 26 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Mediation Results Based on behavior and VBM results , we performed a mediation analysis to further explore whether EI aﬀects TC through rGMV in the right OFC . In the present study , we chose the EI total score measured by SSREIS as independent variable , TC ( imagination , curiosity , challenge , risk - taking , and total score ) measured by WCAT as dependent variables , and rGMV in the right OFC as the mediator . In addition , we also regarded gender , age , general intelligence , and total GMV as covariates for all mediation analyses . As expected , mediation analysis revealed that ( 1 ) rGMV in the right OFC partially mediated the association between EI total score and TC total score ( path a = 0 . 31 , p < 0 . 001 ; path b = 0 . 18 , p = 0 . 02 ; path a × b = 0 . 06 , bootstrapped 95 % CI = 0 . 01 , 0 . 12 ; see Figure 2 ) ; ( 2 ) rGMV in the right OFC partially mediated the 2 http : / / web . mit . edu / swg / software . htm FIGURE 2 | Mediation analysis .

Emotional Intelligence and Creativity DISCUSSION The present study investigated the neural basis of EI and the relationship among EI , brain structure , and individual TC as measured by WCAT in a large young sample . Behavioral results showed that EI was positively correlated with TC , and it’s noteworthy that there was a strong and signiﬁcant positive association between total score of the SSREIS and the total score of the WCAT . In addition , VBM results revealed that rGMV in the right OFC displayed a positive correlation with EI . More importantly , further mediation analysis showed that the right OFC volume partially mediated the association between EI and TC . Behavioral results conﬁrmed that diﬀerent dimensions of EI was positively correlated with TC in varying degrees , especially there was a strong and signiﬁcant positive relationship between the overall level of EI and TC , which is consistent with previous ﬁndings ( Guastello et al . , 2004 ) . Several investigations have showed that the higher level of EI individuals have , the better ability to perceive , regulate , and utilize the emotions of oneself and others they exhibit ( Brackett et al . , 2006 ) , which always lead to maintain a good mood in daily life ( Hertel et al . , 2009 ) . Meanwhile , positive aﬀect is also linked with the improvement of TC ( Guastello et al . , 2004 ) , that is , individual’s creativity is generally activated in a positive emotional state , which contributes to producing more creative behaviors and higher creative achievements ( Ding et al . , 2014 ; Libbrecht et al . , 2014 ) . Based on these ﬁndings , it is reasonably speculated that individuals with greater levels of EI tend to exhibit higher TC . Voxel - based morphometry results exhibited that EI was signiﬁcantly positively correlated with brain regions mainly located in the right OFC , which has been considered to play a crucial role in emotional processing , sensory integration , and reward - driven system ( Kringelbach , 2005 ) . Stalnaker et al . ( 2015 ) also suggested that the OFC is critical for signaling emotions as well . In addition , studies on human brain lesion provided evidence for the conﬁrmation of emotional function related to the OFC . For example , patients with lesion in the OFC performed handicaps in identifying emotional face and voice ( Hornak et al . , 2003 ) , as well as eﬀective emotional regulation ( Beer et al . , 2003 ; Hogeveen et al . , 2016b ) , which signiﬁcantly impaired interpersonal communication and social behavior ( Hornak et al . , 2003 ) . These ﬁndings contribute to the deeper understanding of the OFC guides adaptive behavior and emotional experience ( Stalnaker et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , previous VBM studies have demonstrated that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder have signiﬁcantly less rGMV in the OFC ( Moon and Jeong , 2015 ) , while higher EI can predict less anxiety and depression ( Salguero et al . , 2012 ; Zavala and Lopez , 2012 ) , which revealed that the OFC volume may be closely related to EI , particularly the emotional regulation of EI ( Tan et al . , 2014 ) . Spontaneous brain activity during resting state also found a close relationship between EI and OFC ( Pan et al . , 2014 ) . Combined with these ﬁndings , individuals with higher EI generally exhibit better emotional processing ability , especially in the top – down aspects of emotional regulation , which is closely related to the volumetric variation in the OFC . Interestingly , mediation results revealed that rGMV in the OFC partially mediated the association between EI and TC . Based on previous studies , individuals with high EI generally exhibited excellent emotional regulation ability and benign social cognitive functioning ( Brackett et al . , 2006 ; Hertel et al . , 2009 ) , that may play a major role in promoting the tendency to engage in creativity ( Guastello et al . , 2004 ; Ding et al . , 2014 ; Parke et al . , 2015 ) . From the perspective of the brain structure variations , the OFC is closely related to emotional processing ( Kringelbach , 2005 ) , especially in the top - down aspects of emotional regulation ( Petrovic et al . , 2016 ; Silvers et al . , 2016 ) . Emotional regulation is essential for the maintenance of positive aﬀect that further contribute to promoting creativity ( Parke et al . , 2015 ) , our results also showed the OFC volume associated with TC , which was in line with a recent VBM study . Zhuang et al . ( 2017 ) found that TC was positively correlated with emotion - related brain region , especially in the OFC ( Zhuang et al . , 2017 ) ; another neuroimaging study also reported that the higher levels of self - report creativity individuals have , the larger cortical surface of the OFC they exhibit ( Bashwiner et al . , 2016 ) . These ﬁndings provided evidence for the close association between the OFC and TC , and further showed the OFC volume could account for the relationship between EI and TC . Taken together , the above discussions suggested that the larger volume in the OFC associated with EI reﬂects enhancement of emotional processing ability , especially in the top – down aspects of emotional regulation , which contributes to the promotion of TC . Several limitations of this study should be mentioned . First , although the sample size is relatively large compared with other studies ( Koven et al . , 2011 ; Killgore et al . , 2012 ) , all participants of the present study consisted of healthy , young undergraduates , which may restrain the generalizability of these ﬁndings . In addition , behavior data mainly relied on self - report questionnaires , in spite of previous researches have shown that these questionnaires used in our study have high reliability and validity , the results may also be vulnerable to social desirability . The use of multiple methods and repeated measurements may reduce the impact of subjectivity . Equally important , the cross - sectional design limits causal inference , and the implementation of longitudinal studies may be needed to further clarify causal directions . CONCLUSION The present study found that the gray matter volumetric variation in the right OFC positively correlated with EI . Moreover , further mediation analysis revealed that the OFC volume partially mediated the association between EI and TC , suggested that the Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 6 June 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 925 fpsyg - 09 - 00925 June 13 , 2018 Time : 16 : 11 # 7 He et al . Emotional Intelligence and Creativity larger volume in the OFC associated with EI reﬂects enhancement of emotional processing ability , especially in the top - down aspects of emotional regulation , which contributes to the promotion of TC . These results help sharpen the understanding of the relationship between EI and TC from the perspective of neural substrates . AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS LH , JQ , and XC designed and conducted the study .
