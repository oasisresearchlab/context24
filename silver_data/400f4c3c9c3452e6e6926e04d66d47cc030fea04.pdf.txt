Wolynes , University of California at San Diego , La Jolla , CA , and approved April 24 , 2009 ( received for review February 9 , 2009 ) Mechanical robustness of the cell under different modes of stress and deformation is essential to its survival and function . Under tension , mechanical rigidity is provided by the cytoskeletal net - work ; with increasing stress , this network stiffens , providing increased resistance to deformation . However , a cell must also resist compression , which will inevitably occur whenever cell volume is decreased during such biologically important processes as anhydrobiosis and apoptosis . Under compression , individual ﬁlaments can buckle , thereby reducing the stiffness and weaken - ing the cytoskeletal network . However , the intracellular space is crowded with macromolecules and organelles that can resist com - pression . A simple picture describing their behavior is that of colloidal particles ; colloids exhibit a sharp increase in viscosity with increasing volume fraction , ultimately undergoing a glass transi - tion and becoming a solid . We investigate the consequences of these 2 competing effects and show that as a cell is compressed by hyperosmotic stress it becomes progressively more rigid . Although this stiffening behavior depends somewhat on cell type , starting conditions , molecular motors , and cytoskeletal contributions , its dependence on solid volume fraction is exponential in every instance . This universal behavior suggests that compression - induced weakening of the network is overwhelmed by crowding - induced stiffening of the cytoplasm . We also show that compres - sion dramatically slows intracellular relaxation processes . The increase in stiffness , combined with the slowing of relaxation processes , is reminiscent of a glass transition of colloidal suspen - sions , but only when comprised of deformable particles . Our work provides a means to probe the physical nature of the cytoplasm under compression , and leads to results that are universal across cell type . compression (cid:1) cytoplasm (cid:1) cytoskeleton (cid:1) mechanotransduction (cid:1) stiffness T he abilities of the eukaryotic cell to maintain shape , flow , and remodel are mechanical attributes of substantial biological importance ( 1 – 5 ) , but our understanding of how cellular con - stituents give rise to these mechanical attributes remains incom - plete . Much of the mechanical rigidity of the cell comes from the cytoskeletal network , composed primarily of actin filaments , microtubules and intermediate filaments . The cytoskeletal net - work is predominantly under tension ; its stiffness increases with tension and thereby increases the forces it can support ( 6 – 8 ) . However , filamentous networks typically cannot support appre - ciable compressive stress because filaments will lose their ten - sion , perhaps even buckle , and thus weaken the network . Nev - ertheless , cellular compression occurs within tumors ( 9 ) and will always occur if the volume of the cell is decreased , as occurs in important physiological processes such as osmotic cell shrinkage , regulatory cell volume decreases ( 10 ) , preservation of certain animal life forms during drought ( anhydrobiosis ) ( 11 ) , and apoptosis ( 12 , 13 ) . In addition to containing the cytoskeletal network , the intra - cellular space is filled to near capacity with macromolecules and organelles ( 14 ) . To describe the mechanical behavior of such a crowded molecular space , a simple approximation might be a colloidal suspension of repulsive particles ( 15 ) . Indeed , repulsive colloids are known to exhibit sharp increases in shear stiffness as they are compressed and the particle volume fraction increases , ultimately leading to a glass transition in which the colloid transforms from a liquid to a disordered solid ( 16 , 17 ) . Under compression , such an increase in stiffness would compete di - rectly with any weakening of the network . However , the me - chanical behavior of the cell upon compression has never been systematically investigated and the consequences of these com - peting effects remain unknown . Such an investigation is impor - tant to determine the role of compression on both the mechan - ical properties of the cell , and even on the cell volume itself . In this article , we report the shear stiffness of the living cell subjected to an osmotic compressional stress . As cell volume decreases as a result of water efflux , cell shear stiffness increases with the solid volume fraction in an exponential fashion . Simul - taneously , motor - driven relaxation processes persist even at the highest volume fraction but slow by as much as 2 orders of magnitude . These observations suggest that the mechanical properties of a cell under compression are dominated by the contribution of the crowded interior ; moreover , they suggest an analogy to a repulsive colloidal suspension approaching its glass transition , but only if the suspension comprises highly deform - able particles . Our work provides a framework to characterize the properties of the cell under compression , and enables us to identify behavior that is universal across cell types . Results Volume Fraction and Its Dependence on Hyperosmotic Stress . Crowd - ing within the cytoplasm seems to have been sufficiently impor - tant in the course of evolution that multiple regulatory mecha - nisms arose to detect and respond to even small variations of intermolecular spacing ( 18 ) . In addition to the primary volume response dictated by osmotic equilibrium as governed by van ’t Hoff’s law , secondary mechanisms of cell volume regulation play out over longer scales of time ( 10 ) . To perturb cell volume acutely , we subjected the isolated human airway smooth muscle ( HASM ) cell in culture to sudden hypertonic shock via the addition of 400 - Dalton polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) ( Methods ) . Cell volume was measured by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) in the adherent cell , and , in separate experiments , by direct Author contributions : E . H . Z . and J . J . F . designed research ; E .

Over the wide range of osmotic stresses studied , these 2 methods yielded closely similar volume responses ( Fig . 1 C ) . In response to osmotic shock , cell volume decreased and then equilibrated within a few tens of seconds ( Fig . 1 A ) to volumes similar to that of a perfect osmometer ( Fig . 1 C ) . Similar obser - vations were made for a different osmotic agent ( sucrose ) , after actin depolymerization with latrunculin A , and with 2 different cell types ( lung fibroblasts and SY5Y neuroblastoma cells ) , suggesting that acute changes in cell volume during these ex - treme challenges was dominated by the primary osmotic re - sponse ( Fig . 1 C ) . Overall , the relationship conformed to the well - known Ponder’s relationship ( 19 , 20 ) , v (cid:1) R (cid:2) iso / (cid:2) (cid:3) ( 1 (cid:4) R ) , with a slope of R (cid:1) 0 . 7 ( black line , Fig . 1 C ) , where (cid:2) is the applied osmotic pressure , (cid:2) iso is the isotonic osmotic pressure , and relative cell volume v is the current cell volume normalized by cell volume under isotonic conditions . Its minimum , v min , occurs at the intercept corresponding to infinite osmotic stress . As such , v (cid:4) v min is the water volume that is osmotically active , v min is the volume of the cell that is not osmotically active , and the ‘‘solid’’ volume fraction , (cid:1) (cid:1) v min / v , approaches 1 as v approaches v min ( gray line in Fig . 1 C ) . With Hyperosmotic Stress , the Cell Shear Stiffness Dramatically In - creases . To assess the ability of the cell to resist changes of shape , we used optical magnetic twisting cytometry ( OMTC ) to probe the force - deformation relationship at 0 . 75 Hz , from which the complex shear modulus , G * (cid:1) G (cid:5) (cid:3) iG (cid:6) , can be calculated with the aid of a finite element model ( 3 , 21 ) ( SI Results and Discussion ) . Here , G (cid:5) and G (cid:6) are storage and loss moduli , respectively , and we mainly focus on the magnitude G (cid:1) (cid:1) G * (cid:1) . Cell shear stiffness at isotonic condition , G iso , was stable and close to 2000 Pa . With application of hyperosmotic stress ( PEG ) , cell stiffness increased in a manner that depended on osmolality , consistent with prior reports ( 22 , 23 ) ( Fig . 1 D ) . Like the volume response , the stiffening response reached a plateau within a few tens of seconds . As bath osmolality increased and the volume fraction (cid:1) approached 1 the level of the stiffness plateau dramatically increased ( Figs . 1 D and 2 A ) . Extreme osmotic stress caused shear stiffness of the HASM cell to increase by more than an order of magnitude and , as shown below , in other cell types to increase by more than two orders of magnitude . The magni - tude of this response can be appreciated by noting that the most extreme challenge with a potent contractile agonist causes the stiffness of these contractile cells , at most , to double ( 24 ) . Although shear stiffness increased greatly , images of the actin cytoskeleton revealed no remarkable changes ( Fig . S1 ) . We further probed the frequency dependence of the cell stiffness . In isotonic steady - state conditions the storage and loss moduli , G (cid:5) and G (cid:6) , followed a weak power law over 4 frequency decades ( Fig . S2 ) . With progressively increasing osmotic stress , both G (cid:5) and G (cid:6) increased systematically but the power law exponent remained largely constant . Bulk changes of cell volume are described by the osmotic bulk modulus , (cid:1) ( d (cid:2) / d (cid:1) ) , where (cid:2) is the osmotic stress , and it too increased strongly as (cid:1) approached 1 ( SI Results and Discussion and Fig . S3 ) . To assess the generality of these results , we then examined a variety of other cases . When we treated HASM cells with deoxyglucose and sodium azide , which act to deplete adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , G iso decreased by over 3 - fold ( 4 , 25 ) , but with increasing volume fraction the shear stiffness increased dramatically nonetheless , reaching a value similar to that of the untreated cells ( Figs . 1 E and 2 A ) . When we treated these cell with latrunculin A , which acts to depolymerize filamentous actin , G iso decreased by nearly 20 - fold but the shear stiffness increased sharply as (cid:1) approached 1 , again reaching a value similar to that of the untreated cells ( Figs . 1 F and 2 A ) . When we used a different impermeant solute ( sucrose ) or a different bead coat - ing ( poly L - Lysine , which couples to the cell nonspecifically , as opposed to RGD , which binds to integrins ) , we found similar 0 100 200 300 t ( s ) 0 100 200 300 t ( s ) 0 100 200 300 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 t ( s ) G ( P a ) 0 100 200 300 0 0 . 5 1 t ( s ) v 0 70 0 700 5 0 70 0 700 5 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 0 . 5 1 Π iso / Π v Π iso / Π 1 0 . 5 0 φ C B A F E D 5 µ m µ m µ m Fig . 1 .

Assuming that the same relationship existed between volume fraction and bath osmolality as in the HASM cell , we then examined 3 other cell types : Madin – Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) epithelial cells , SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and human lung fibroblasts . Despite significantly different baseline stiffnesses , in every case the stiffness of these different cell types increased dramatically with increasing volume fraction and appeared to converge at the highest volume fraction ( Fig . 2 C ) . The maximum value of the stiffness was nearly invariant with G iso and fell in the range of 10 4 to 10 5 Pa ( Fig . 2 E ) . Accordingly , with changes of cytoskeletal integrity , ATP avail - ability , cell type , solute , or bead coating , the dependence of cell stiffness on volume fraction (cid:1) was robust and qualitatively similar . Thus , the mechanical properties of the cell under compression are dominated by the contents of the crowded intercellular space , becoming progressively stiffer with increas - ing osmotic compression . With Hyperosmotic Stress Spontaneous Nanoscale Motions Dramati - cally Slow . To gain insights into the intracellular relaxation dynamics , we monitored spontaneous nanoscale motions of a microbead that was tightly coupled to the cytoskeleton ( 4 , 26 ) . When mean square bead displacement ( MSD ) was resolved as a function of time lag (cid:8) t , it exhibited subdiffusive behavior for small (cid:8) t and superdiffusive behavior for large (cid:8) t ( Fig . 3 A ) , confirming many previous reports ( 4 , 26 , 27 ) . With increasing volume fraction , there was a dramatic reduction in spontaneous bead motions , but even at the maximum volume fraction these motions remained superdiffusive at long time scales indicating persistent nonequilibrium dynamics in the crowded intracellular space ( Fig . S4 ) . All these relationships have approximately the same shape and could be scaled onto a single master curve ( Fig . 3 A Inset ) ; as such , this behavior could be fully characterized by the dependence of remodeling dynamics on only one character - istic time . As a measure of this characteristic time , (cid:2) , required to achieve a given extent of structural rearrangement , we set an arbitrary threshold value of the MSD ( 100 nm 2 ) and then recorded the corresponding time lag needed to achieve that threshold value . As volume fraction increased , (cid:2) at first precip - itously increased but then reached an approximate plateau ( Fig . 3 B ) . When ATP was depleted , (cid:2) was far larger at baseline , suggesting that baseline rearrangements are actively driven ( 4 ) , but as volume fraction progressively increased , (cid:2) rose to approx - imately the same plateau value ( Fig . 3 B ) . F - actin depolymeriza - tion by latrunculin A accelerated baseline remodeling by an order of magnitude , but with progressive increase in volume fraction , (cid:2) again rose to approximately the same plateau ( Fig . 3 B ) . Despite such a plateau at high volume fraction , these dynamics depend sensitively on volume fraction near isotonic conditions . Discussion With Volumetric Compression , Cell Stiffness Increases in an Exponen - tial Fashion . In isotonic conditions the major determinant of the cellular shear stiffness is known to be the cytoskeletal tensile prestress ( 6 – 8 , 28 ) , and it is conceivable therefore that increases of G caused by osmotic compression were secondary to under - lying increases in this tensile prestress . Much evidence argues against this interpretation , however . Depletion of ATP would be expected to blunt any active contractile response , and , indeed , isotonic stiffness in that case was much smaller but osmotically induced increases in cell stiffness were dramatically enhanced ( Fig . 1 D ) . Similarly , depolymerization of actin filaments largely ablates cytoskeletal tensile prestress ( 6 ) , but osmotically induced increases in cell stiffness were seen to be even greater still ( Fig . 1 E ) . Finally , we measured changes in prestress by studying the isolated airway smooth muscle ( ASM ) strip ( SI Methods ) ; for technical reasons , traction force microscopy ( 6 , 7 ) cannot be used in the context of extreme osmotic stress . When challenged with hyperosmotic stress , the longitudinal stiffness of the ASM strip increased in a manner comparable to the ASM cell in culture , as described above , whereas the prestress did not increase and even tended to decrease ( Fig . S5 ) . Taken together , these findings rule out the cytoskeletal network and the tensile 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 φ G ( P a ) 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 φ G − G i s o ( P a ) 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 φ G − G i s o ( P a ) 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 φ G ( P a ) 10 2 10 3 5 10 15 20 25 G iso ( Pa ) F 10 2 10 3 10 3 10 4 10 5 G iso ( Pa ) G m a x E C A F D B φ φ φ φ Fig . 2 .

We therefore considered the simplest possible alternative , namely , the notion that the shear stiffness of the cell comprises 2 independent and additive contributions—one attributable to the cytoskeleton network , which is thought to dominate in isotonic conditions ( 6 – 8 ) , and the other attributable to the colloidal phase , which becomes increasingly important as water leaves the cell and the volume fraction (cid:1) increases . If these contributions are additive and independent , then the colloidal contribution would be isolated by subtracting from the measured stiffness ( G ) of the osmotically compressed cell the isotonic stiffness of that cell ( G iso ) . Upon doing this subtraction , the colloidal contribution is seen to depend on volume fraction exponentially ( Figs . 2 B and 2 D ) , G (cid:3) G iso (cid:4) G 0 e F (cid:1) [ 1 ] where the parameter F quantifies the sensitivity of the colloidal stiffness to changes in volume fraction (cid:1) , and G 0 represents this stiffness at infinite dilution ( (cid:1) (cid:1) 0 ) . The parameter F varied inversely with G iso ( Fig . 2 F ) and G 0 varied positively with G iso ( Fig . S6 ) . This relationship therefore reveals a simple but universal phenomenological rule by which volumetric compres - sion enhances shear stiffness of the eukaryotic cell . Under compression , cytoskeletal filaments experience smaller tension , perhaps even buckle , and for either reason will tend to soften . Thus , the relative increase in cell shear stiffness that is observed under osmotic compression cannot be attributed to cytoskeletal network tension and seems to arise mainly from the crowded colloidal cytoplasm . If true , we would expect to see general behavior of cells that remains applicable independent of the state of the cytoskeleton . Indeed , such a behavior is found in Eq . 1 , regardless of the integrity of the cytoskeleton . This provides strong support for a dominant colloidal contribution to the cell’s shear stiffness under compressive stress . The approach to the glass transition is exponential in (cid:1) and data converge at high (cid:1) in every case , but the sensitivity of stiffness to changes in (cid:1) differs depending on circumstances ( Fig . 2 B , D , and F ) . For example , the behavior would appear to depend on the relative amounts of polymerized actin , suggesting a potential role of protein shape , and the presence of ATP , indicating that non - equilibrium factors come into play . Analogy to the Colloidal Glass Transition . This mechanical behavior of the osmotically compressed cell has interesting physical implications . Living cells are under continuous remodeling and relaxation , such as revealed by the spontaneous motions of adherent beads ( Fig . 3 A Insets ) . These spontaneous motions are consistent with the idea that the cell under isotonic conditions is far from being a simple elastic solid ( 4 ) . Our data further reveal that even under maximum osmotic compression , relaxation processes persist but become dramatically slowed . Indeed , dra - matic slowing of relaxation processes is a hallmark of the glass transition ( 29 ) . For molecular liquids , decreases in temperature lead to increases in relaxation time until the system becomes frozen into an amorphous solid ( 29 ) , whereas for colloidal suspensions it is decreases in system volume , and corresponding increases in volume fraction , that lead to such a transition ( 17 ) . Our MSD data therefore suggest that the behavior of cells under compression is reminiscent of the colloidal glass transition in qualitative terms , but how can we understand osmotically com - pressed cells in the context of the colloidal glass transition in quantitative terms ? Spontaneous bead motions are suggestive , but these motions cannot be used to extract the true relaxation time because they are driven by the motor - generated forces , which are hard to measure and likely to vary with compression . The relaxation time under a constant external force is thus desirable , and can be quantified via the material viscosity and active rheology . To estimate the cytoplasmic viscosity , (cid:5) , from the oscillatory shear modulus we used the Cox – Merz rule ( 30 ) . If (cid:6) ˙ is the shear rate in a constant shear experiment , and if (cid:7) is the frequency in an oscillatory experiment , then the Cox – Merz rule requires that (cid:5) (cid:1) (cid:6) ˙ (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) G ( (cid:7) ) / (cid:7) . It is well established that cell rheology exhibits a weak power law over a wide frequency range ( 3 – 5 , 8 , 25 , 31 , 32 ) , and that this behavior is explained phenom - enologically by the soft glassy rheology ( SGR ) model ( 33 ) . This model predicts that for the typical power - law slope ( (cid:7) 0 . 2 ) observed in cells ( Fig . S2 ) , the Cox – Merz rule will underestimate the viscosity by 40 – 60 % ( 33 ) . Because this establishes the shear viscosity to well within one order of magnitude , and because the power - law slope is little affected by compression ( Fig . S2 ) , this error does not appreciably affect the comparison of viscosities for different compressive stresses .

Arrhenius - Like , Strong Glassy Behavior . The exponential manner in which viscosity varies with volume fraction sheds light on the properties of constituent particles and the interactions among them . The viscosity of hard sphere colloids approaching a glass transition varies with volume fraction (cid:1) as described by Moon - ey’s equation ( 34 ) , (cid:5) (cid:1) (cid:5) s exp [ (cid:8)(cid:1) / ( (cid:1) 0 (cid:4) (cid:1) ) ] , whereas the viscosity of a molecular liquid approaching a glass transition varies with temperature T as described by the Vogel – Fulcher – Tammann ( VFT ) equation ( 29 ) , (cid:5) (cid:1) (cid:5) 0 exp [ DT 0 / ( T (cid:4) T 0 ) ] . For the former equation , (cid:5) s is the solvent viscosity , (cid:1) 0 is 0 . 64 for hard spheres , and (cid:8) is the crowding factor ( 1 . 1 for hard spheres ) ; for the latter , (cid:5) 0 is the viscosity at infinite temperature , T 0 is the so - called VFT temperature , and D controls the deviation of this relationship from the Arrhenius law . The similarity between these 2 equa - tions suggests that in these systems (cid:1) and 1 / T play analogous roles in the approach to the glass transition . We note in particular that in certain limits the Mooney’s equation becomes exponen - tial in (cid:1) , i . e . , Arrhenius - like , and fits very well data for cells under compression ( Fig . 4 A ) . As such , the concept of fragility , which has been instrumental in the categorization of strong versus fragile molecular glass formers ( 29 ) , can be extended to colloidal glassy systems . We define (cid:1) g , the glass transition volume fraction , as the volume fraction at which viscosity reaches an arbitrarily chosen high value , 40 , 000 Pa (cid:2) s , and the fragility , m , for the colloidal glass transition as the slope of the relationship between log (cid:5) versus (cid:1) / (cid:1) g as the latter approaches 1 . The fragility for hard spheres is seen to be quite high , whereas the fragility of cells is much lower ( Fig . 4 B ) . Our data therefore show that the osmotically compressed cell behaves very differ - ently from a suspension of hard spheres ; whereas the latter behaves as a fragile glass - former , the eukaryotic cell is reminis - cent of a strong glass - former ( 29 ) . Physical Basis for Strong Glassy Behavior . That a soft cell under compressive stress behaves as a strong glass is a clear finding and represents the major result of this report . The underlying structures and processes that might account for this finding remain a good deal less clear , however , and represent an open question . We found that ATP depletion strongly modulates the glass transition behavior of the cell , consistent with the notion that nonequilibrium processes may modulate glass transition behavior ( 35 ) . Similarly , we found that F - actin disruption sub - stantially increases the fragility , consistent with theoretical work demonstrating the effects of particle geometry on glass transition behavior ( 36 ) . In addition , macromolecules , and organelles within the eukaryotic cytoplasm are far from being compact hard spheres . Even at isotonic volume fraction , it is likely that they interact with each other strongly , unlike the situation for hard sphere suspensions at a similar volume fraction , in which case the particles barely interact . Such interactions potentially explain the much higher viscosity of the cytoplasm compared with that of the hard sphere suspension at the same concentration . More importantly , these ‘‘particles’’ are deformable ; for example , under the influence of molecular crowding proteins have been shown to deform and change conformation ( 14 , 37 ) . In this respect , then , the cytoplasm resembles a colloidal system of repulsive , deformable particles , exemplified by suspensions of star polymers , block - copolymer micelles , and soft microgel particles . Indeed , these systems often exhibit more gradual increases in viscosity than those found for hard sphere colloids during the approach to glass transition ( 38 , 39 ) . Furthermore , Mattsson et al . demonstrated a direct association between the deformability of individual particles and the fragility character - izing the colloidal glass transition ( Mattsson J , Wyss HM , Fernandez - Nieves A , Miyazaki K , Hu Z , Reichman DR , Weitz DA ( personal communication ) Soft colloids make strong glasses . ) Although the mechanistic connection between particle deformability and glass fragility remains unclear ( 40 – 42 ) , the strong glassy dynamics of the cytoplasm closely resembles those found in a crowded suspension of repulsive soft colloidal par - ticles ( Fig . 4 ) . In summary , the eukaryotic cell possesses a cytoskeleton that is under tension but also a crowded intracellular space that is under compression . The mechanical behavior of the former is positively determined by tension ( 6 – 8 ) and is reasonably well described by the model for soft glassy rheology ( 3 , 33 ) . By contrast , the behavior of the latter is positively determined by compression and is reminiscent of a suspension of soft , deform - able particles capable of undergoing a colloidal glass transition . These findings highlight the rich mechanical behavior of the cell , but also suggest a new mechanism by which the cell could regulate its mechanical behavior . 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 0 10 1 10 2 G iso ( Pa ) m 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 10 −4 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 φ / φ g η ( P a s ) φ / φ g η ( P a s ) Cells Hard spheres A B Fig . 4 .

The exponential growth of viscosity for cells is sharply contrasted by the stronger increase in viscosity for hard spheres ( 16 ) , which greatly accelerates as the volume fraction increased toward the glass transition ( pluses ) . In the x axis , we normalized the volume fraction by that at the glass transition , deﬁned as the point at which viscosity reaches an arbi - trarilychosenhighvalue , 40 , 000Pa (cid:2) s .

ThisstiffnessforhardsphereswasestimatedusingtheCoz - Merzrule at the volume fraction of 0 . 3 . The fragility of the hard spheres is (cid:9) 1 order of magnitude higher , whereas their ‘‘isotonic stiffness’’ is a few orders of mag - nitude lower , than the corresponding values for cells .

Methods We cultured HASM cells , MDCK II cells , SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and human lung ﬁbroblasts ( CCL 151 ) on collagen I - coated 96 - well plates ( Corning ) . Hyperosmotic medium was prepared by dissolving PEG or sucrose in isotonic medium . We measured cell volume , using AFM on adherent cells , or optical imaging on trypsinized , rounded cells immobilized onto poly L - Lysine ( PLL ) ( 4 kDa ) coated plastic well . Using OMTC , stiffness of the cell was measured by actively twisting beads tightly bound to the cell surface ( 3 ) ; dynamic remod - eling of the cell was measured by recording the movements of these surface - bound beads in the absence of any active bead twisting ( 4 ) . The 4 . 5 - (cid:9) m magnetic beads were coated with either RGD peptides or PLL . We used ﬁnite element models to estimate the shear modulus of the cell from OMTC exper - iments ( SI Results and Discussion , Figs . S7 , S8 , and S9 ) . Detailed methods are provided in SI Methods .
