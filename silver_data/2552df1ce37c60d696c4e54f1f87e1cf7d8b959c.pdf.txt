They claimed that their model could better account for existing mutational data , was in better agreement with previous NMR studies , and that the presence of a cross - link in our structure made it irrelevant to understanding J : Hsp70 interactions . Here we detail extensive NMR and mutational data relevant to understanding J : Hsp70 function and show that , in fact , our structure is much better able to account for the mutational data and is in much better agreement with a previous NMR study of a mammalian polyoma virus T - ag J domain : Hsc70 complex than is the Ahmad et al . complex , and that our structure is predictive and provides insight into J : Hsp70 interactions and mechanism of ATPase activation . I . Comparison with previous NMR studies of J - Hsp70 interactions : The regions of the J domains of 2 J proteins that interact with Hsp70 have been previously mapped by NMR chemical shift analysis . Greene et al . ( 3 ) mapped them in a complex of bacterial DnaJ and DnaK and Garimella et al . ( 4 ) mapped them in a complex of polyoma virus T - ag J domain and bovine Hsc70 . Ahmad et al . state that the data from their complex agrees with the data of Greene et al . and that our structure does not . The Ahmad et al . complex does show better agreement with the Greene et al . study , though there are discrepancies : Greene et al . observe shifts in the functionally critical H and D residues of the invariant HPD motif , while Ahmad et al . conclude that their own data do not support a role for the HPD loop in binding DnaK : ADP , and say that they observed “no chemical shift changes for residues Asp35 ( and His33 ) of the HPD loop…It appears that the HPD motif is exclusively involved in the interaction with the ATP state , although it could also have a purely structural role . ” Ahmad et al . suggest that the Greene et al . results for D35 could have been due to asp - specific pH effects . However Greene et al . observed significant peak broadening for H33 as well as D35 upon titration with DnaK : ADP so asp - specific pH effects or differences in nucleotide state cannot explain this discrepancy . More importantly , our structure is of a mammalian Hsc70 : J complex , and specifically we use bovine Hsc70 , as was used by Garimella et al . When our structure is compared to the chemical shift / peak broadening / protection data from Garimella et al . we find excellent agreement : 8 of 13 residues in PyJ identified as shifted / broadended by Garimella et al . correspond to auxilin residues that are close to Hsc70 in our structure . In contrast , the Ahmad et al . complex is entirely inconsistent with the Garimella data : none of the residues identified as broadened / shifted in Garimella correspond to J residues identified in the Ahmad et al . complex as close to labeled DnaK residues . This is expected . The Garimella and Greene studies indicated that prokaryotic Hsp70 binds DnaJ differently than how mammalian Hsc70 binds J protein . Bacterial DnaJ uses primarily J domain helix II to bind bacterial DnaK , while the mammalian ( viral ) protein uses primarily helix III to bind mammalian Hsc70 . The different binding mode of Hsc70 : PyJ vs . DnaK : DnaJ was the central conclusion of the Garimella study , being incorporated in the title , addressed in the abstract ( “our novel evidence implicating helix III differs from evidence that Escherichia coli DnaK primarily affects helix II and the HPD loop of DnaJ . ” ) , and in the introduction , results , and discussion of that study . This conclusion is also supported by extensive mutational data ( see below ) . It is primarily auxilin J domain helix III which contacts Hsc70 in our structure . Since our complex is of a mammalian Hsc70 and a mammalian J , it should be compared , and is expected to be more similar to , the mammalian complex studied by Garimella , rather than the bacterial complex studied by Greene . The excellent agreement between the Garimella et al . results and our structure is strong evidence for the physiological relevance of the latter . These NMR data and relevant references are summarized in table 1 . 2 II . Mutational data : 1 . At least 38 single , multiple point and deletion mutants in the bacterial DnaJ J domain have been characterized for complementation in vivo , with a subset also characterized for binding to and ability to stimulate DnaK in vitro ( 5 - 7 ) . These mutations identify 9 residues ( Y25 , R26 , H33 , P34 , D35 , R36 , N37 , F47 ) that result in complementation defects when mutated . Mutants of H33 and D35 have also been shown to disrupt binding to DnaK in vitro ( 6 , 8 ) . Of these 9 residues only one ( K26 ) is identified as within 5 - 15 Å of one of the 6 DnaK residues in the Ahmad et al . complex that were spin - labeled to provide distance constraints . There are another 5 residues identified in this complex as being within 5 - 15 Å of a labeled DnaK residue . Mutations at these 5 residues do not give rise to complementation defects . In contrast , in our structure , there are 27 auxilin J domain residues close ( < 8 Å ) to the Hsc70 NBD . These close residues correspond to 8 of the 9 functionally critical DnaJ residues . 2 . The more relevant mutational data sets for evaluating our structure , however , are not those of bacterial DnaJ , but of viral T - ag J domains which bind the mammalian Hsc70 we used to prepare our complex . As noted above , NMR studies indicate that mammalian Hsc70 binds J very differently than how bacterial DnaK binds DnaJ . The mutational data sets ( 9 - 11 ) on the viral T - ag J domains are too extensive to fully summarize ( one study ( 9 ) examined 63 mutants in polyoma virus large T - ag J domain and 51 in middle T J domains ) . However , there are at least 14 well - expressed point mutations in polyoma or SV40 large T - ag J domains shown to disrupt complementation in vivo or binding / ATPase stimulation in vitro . None of these mutations are at residues identified in the Ahmad et al . , complex as within 15 Å of labeled residues in DnaK , and 5 are more than 20 Å away . In contrast , 12 of the 14 corresponding auxilin residues are within 8 Å of Hsc70 in our complex . 3 . On the DnaK NBD there are at least 10 single or 2 - 4 residue segments that affect J binding or ATPase stimulation ( Y146 - D148 , R151 , D388 , D393 , R167 , N170 , T173 , E217V218 , V388 - L392 , L390L391 ) ( 6 , 12 - 14 ) . Where it has been examined , mutations of corresponding residues in bovine Hsc70 are also found to affect J binding / stimulation ( 15 ) and experiments with bovine Hsc70 identify 2 additional residues ( I216 and L380 corresponding , respectively , to DnaK T215 and T383 ) ( 2 ) that abolish J stimulation and binding . The Ahmad et al . complex identifies 16 DnaK residues ( 206 - 211 ) that are within 5 - 15 Å of one of the 3 labeled DnaJ residues . Of these residues only 2 ( 217 , 218 ) correspond to a region on DnaK that affects interaction with J when mutated . The other 11 functionally critical residues / regions in DnaK are all more than 20 Å from the labeled DnaJ residues in the Ahmad et al . complex . The Ahmad et al . complex also identifies a close approach of J to DnaK residues 208 / 209 , but mutation of these residues does not abrogate J stimulation / binding ( see point 5 below ) . In contrast , in our structure , there are 33 Hsc70 NBD residues close ( < 8 Å ) to the auxilin J domain . These close residues encompass 10 of the 12 residues / regions that affect J binding / stimulation when mutated . All of this published mutational data is summarized in Tables 2 - 4 , along with relevant references . 4 . Ahmad et al . state that the cysteine mutants used to introduce spin labels did not affect ATP hydrolysis , “these ( and all other spin - labeled mutants reported upon here ) were unperturbed in the ATP - hydrolysis activity assays ( Fig . S5 ) ” . This is a misrepresentation . Inspection of figure S5 shows that all of these mutations have effects on ATP hydrolysis , with reductions in initial rates of 2 - 10 fold . 5 . Ahmad et al . state that the effects of mutating DnaK DE208 , 209 support their proposed role for these residues in binding J “DnaK DE ( 208 , 209 ) AA is only partially stimulated by DnaJ , whereas the ATP hydrolysis of DnaK DE ( 208 , 209 ) AA by itself is not affected ( Fig . S6 ) . ” This is a misrepresentation . Inspection of figure S6 reveals that the J stimulated ATPase rate of DE ( 208 , 209 ) AA is fully ~ 80 % of WT while the unstimulated rate of this mutant is ~ 30 % greater than the WT . In addition , we have characterized Hsc70 mutations that correspond to DnaK ED208 , 209 ( ED213 , 214AA ) . This mutant is WT in its ability to bind and be stimulated by auxilin and to mediate auxilin dependent clathrin coat disassembly ( 15 ) . 3 6 . Ahmad et al . state that the identified J interacting region ( aa 206 - 221 ) on DnaK is well conserved and that this may explain the cross - species functionality of the J domain . The nucleotide binding domains of Hsp70s are one of the best conserved protein families known so almost any region is likely to show some cross - species conservation but , in fact , the DnaK 206 - 221 loop , overall , is one of the more poorly conserved regions in the Hsp70 NBD , with extensive variation at residues 208 / 209 , a deletion of residue 210 ( in K relative to other 70s ) and a 4 residue insertion of residues 211 - 215 in E . coli DnaK that is not present in the vast majority of Hsp70s ( 16 ) . III . Functional Relevance of the Ahmad et al . Complex and our Structure . 1 . The relevance of the J domain : Hsp70 complex studied in the ADP state by Ahmad et al . is unclear . Ahmad et al . estimates the K d for DnaJ binding to their DnaK : ADP : substrate complex to be ~ 16  M , which would make it too weak to be physiogically relevant . However , its possible that it plays a transient role during protein substrate handoff when the J protein and Hsp70 protein substrate binding domains both engage different regions of the same protein substrate . Though biochemical studies have indicated that the J domain : Hsp70 interaction is stable only in the ATPase state ( 6 , 17 - 19 ) , is possible that the high concentrations of this protein achieved in an NMR tube allow a weak J domain : DnaK ADP state interaction to be detected . We would note , however , that we have been unable to detect chemical shifts with Hsc70 NBD and auxilin J domain even at > [ 100  M ] of the latter ( unpublished ) , so it may be that the auxilin J : Hsc70 : ADP interaction is even weaker than the Dna J : DnaK : ADP interaction . We therefore prepared the cross - linked auxilin J domain : Hsc70 complex with the aim of gaining insight into the structure of the ATP state complex . Indeed , we found that the presence of ATP in the crosslinking reaction enhanced the formation of the cross - linked species . Ahmad et al . acknowledge that the ATP and ADP state complexes may differ , but does not acknowledge the possibility that differences between his ADP state complex and ours may be due to the fact that our complex resembles the ATP state . 2 . Ahmad et al . state that our complex cannot be physiologically relevant because it contains a disulfide cross - link . However , the engineering of cross - links to allow crystallization of transient or excessively dynamic complexes was not unprecedented when we did it , and has become a fairly common approach . We searched the PDB with the terms “disulfide linked” , “crosslinked” , “crosslink” , “disulfide - linked” , “cross - linked” , and “cross - link” and identified 558 entries . Not all of these hits represent crosslinks engineered for structure determination , but sampling of these entries indicates that a large fraction are ( time precluded an inspection of all 558 entries to obtain precise statistics ) . Examples would be the Verdine and Harrison groups’ preparation of HIVI RT : DNA co - crystals ( 1RTD ( 20 ) ) , of the Steitz groups’ preparation of DNAP : DNA co - crystals ( 1KLN ( 21 ) ) , or of the Poulos’ group determination of a cross - linked cytochrome c peroxidase - cytochrome c structure ( 1S6V ( 22 ) ) . These approaches allow determination of the structure of a transient or dynamic complex that cannot otherwise be captured , and while the crosslink restricts conformational freedom at the crosslink site , it does not dictate the conformation of the complex as a whole . In the complex we prepared there is freedom of rotation around the disulfide bond so the auxilin J domain is free to settle into the most energetically favorable configuration on the surface of the Hsc70 and its position in the crystal structure is informative . It is , however , critical that other evidence support the physiological relevance of such a complex . In our case we showed that ( 2 ) : i . In solution , the auxilin J domain stimulated the ATPase activity of a construct encompassing the Hsc70 nucleotide binding domain and interdomain linker ( NBD _ Linker ) but not of the NBD alone . The complex precisely recapitulated this solution behavior : the crosslinked auxilin stimulated ATP hydrolysis by the NBD _ Linker but not by the NBD alone . In addition , ATP enhanced crosslinking to the NBD _ Linker but not the NBD , ii . The complex was in excellent agreement with previous mutational studies , particularly for the viral T - ag J domains , and with the Garimella NMR study of the polyoma virus T - ag J domain : Hsc70 complex , as detailed above , iii . The complex successfully predicted that mutation of L380 would abrogate auxilin’s ability to stimulate Hsc70 ATPase activity , iv . The complex revealed that the cross - linked auxilin induced partial ordering of the interdomain linker and suggested how the J domain could stimulate ATPase activity by conformational effects on the linker , a mechanism that is gaining increasing support ( 23 ) , v . The complex is consistent with the cryo - EM structure of a clathrin coat : Hsc70 ( ATP ) : auxilin complex ( 24 ) . 4 Summation : 1 . Our cross - linked bovine Hsc70 : auxilin J domain complex is in excellent agreement with the NMR study of the bovine Hsc70 : polyoma virus T - ag J complex , but not in agreement with the NMR study of the bacterial DnaJ : DnaK complex . This is expected since it is known that the T - ag J complex and the bacterial complex bind via different modes and we expect the two mammalian complexes to be more similar to each other than to the bacterial complex . Consistent with this , the Ahmad et al . complex shows no agreement with the T - ag J complex and agreement with the previous NMR study of DnaJ : DnaK , though there are surprising discrepancies with the latter , including the unexpected observation that the HPD loop is not involved in binding DnaK . 2 . Our structure can better account for existing mutational data : the large majority of residues on the Hsp70 or J domain surface that have been shown to affect Hsp70 : J domain interaction map to residues at the interprotein interface in our structure ( 8 / 9 for DnaJ ; 12 / 14 for Py or SV40 J ; 10 / 12 for Hsp70 ) . In the Ahmad et al . complex only a minority of these residues are indicated to be at the interprotein interface ( 1 / 9 for DnaJ ; 0 / 14 for Py or SV40 J ; 1 / 12 for Hsp70 ) . 3 . Our cross - linked structure recapitulates the solution behavior of the non cross - linked species , has been shown to predict residues whose mutation affects J : Hsc70 interactions , and suggests a mechanism for J stimulation of ATPase activity through effects on the interdomain linker consistent with evolving models . We would have carried out a more thorough inspection of the Ahmad et al . complex if we could have but there was no statement of coordinate deposition in the PDB or accession number given . Ahmad et al . stated that such coordinates were in the supplemental data : “The coordinates of 50 MD snapshots for the DnaJ – DnaK complex are given in the SI Text . ” , but when we examined the supplemental data we could find no such coordinate set . 5 PyJ residues shifted / broadened / DnaJ residues shifted or Corresponding residue and distance Closest NMR derived distance constraint protected ( Garimella ( 4 ) ) broadened ( Greene ( 3 ) ) to Hsc70 in Jiang ( 2 ) complex to labeled DnaK ( Ahmad et al . , complex ) * Y6 @ N829 > 8 20 - 200 V12 # M853 > 8 15 - 20 S13 A854 > 8 20 - 200 A16 # V857 > 8 20 - 200 R19 # E860 > 8 15 - 20 E20 Q861 > 8 15 - 20 I21 V862 > 8 20 - 200 Q32 K864 > 8 15 - 20 ( K23 ) A24 V865 > 8 15 - 20 Y25 # Y866 < 8 15 - 20 K26 R867 > 8 5 - 15 R27 K868 > 8 5 - 15 L28 A869 > 8 5 - 15 M30 L871 > 8 5 - 15 Y32 V873 < 8 5 - 15 H33 H874 < 8 15 - 20 D35 D876 < 8 15 - 20 D44 K877 < 8 15 - 20 ( R36 ) K45 K877 < 8 15 - 20 ( R36 ) A50 M889 < 8 20 - 200 ( A45 ) L51 I890 < 8 20 - 200 ( K46 ) M52 F891 < 8 20 - 200 ( F47 ) Q53 M892 < 8 20 - 200 ( K48 ) N56 N895 < 8 15 - 20 ( K51 ) Y54 @ W898 < 8 15 - 20 G60 S899 < 8 15 - 20 ( E55 ) T61 E900 > 8 15 - 20 ( V56 ) K63 E902 > 8 20 - 200 ( T60 ) T64 N903 > 8 20 - 200 ( D61 ) E65 Q904 > 8 20 - 200 ( S62 ) Table 1 .
