Lim 1 * and Cora - Ann Schoenenberger 2 Cancer initiation and progression follow complex molecular and structural changes in the extracellular matrix and cellular architecture of living tissue . However , it remains poorly understood how the transformation from health to malignancy alters the mechanical properties of cells within the tumour microenvironment . Here , we show using an indentation - type atomic force microscope ( IT - AFM ) that unadulterated human breast biopsies display distinct stiffness proﬁles . Correlative stiffness maps obtained on normal and benign tissues show uniform stiffness proﬁles that are characterized by a single distinct peak . In contrast , malignant tissues have a broad distribution resulting from tissue heterogeneity , with a prominent low - stiffness peak representative of cancer cells . Similar ﬁndings are seen in speciﬁc stages of breast cancer in MMTV - PyMT transgenic mice . Further evidence obtained from the lungs of mice with late - stage tumours shows that migration and metastatic spreading is correlated to the low stiffness of hypoxia - associated cancer cells . Overall , nanomechanical proﬁling by IT - AFM provides quantitative indicators in the clinical diagnostics of breast cancer with translational signiﬁcance . P hysical and chemical forces mediate the order by which cells proliferate , differentiate and migrate 1 within the three - dimensional microenvironment of living tissue 2 . Perturbations to this intricate balance 3 – 5 are known to promote tumorigenesis and progression to metastasis 6 . At the molecular level , tumour initiation and progression are accompanied by complex structural changes in the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and cellular architecture , which are anticipated to develop differentiable mechanical responses 7 . However , it has been difﬁcult to reach a consensus as to how such biomechanical heterogeneities occur and what their role might be . This is due to challenges in being able to discriminate between the mechanoresponses of cells and the surrounding ECM within native tumour tissue with adequate spatial / structural resolution and force sensitivity . Not least for its implications in diagnostics and treatment , being able to understand the mechanobiology of tumorigenesis is paramount in revealing its deterministic role in cancer development and metastasis 5 . Long - standing ambiguities exist because efforts to understand cancer biomechanics are largely polarized between tumour - level and single - cell experimentation . In accordance with conventional wisdom ( breast palpation ) , studies on whole mouse mammary glands show that breast tumours are considerably more rigid than the surrounding tissue due to a relative stiffening of the peripheral tumour stroma 7 , 8 . This notion is consistent with the increase in matrix deposition and crosslinking observed in three - dimensional cell cultures and mouse mammary glands during cancer pro - gression 9 , 10 . Paradoxically , biophysical techniques 11 – 16 reveal that single ( cultured ) cancer cells are more compliant ( or ‘softer’ ) than their healthy counterparts . This increase in elasticity and / or deformability is accompanied by alterations in the cytoarchitecture that have known associations with malignant transformation 17 . Because of their softness , cancer cells have been detected by inden - tation - type atomic force microscopy ( IT - AFM ) in tissue sections from tumours that were surgically removed from patients with advanced cancer 18 . Furthermore , Cross et al . found that metastatic cells isolated from the pleural ﬂuid of human patients are softer than normal cells 12 , suggesting that metastasis might be promoted by cell compliance . No doubt , criticism is common on both sides of the length - scale divide . On the one hand , the mechanoresponse of whole tumours is arguably dominated by stiff structural elements in the peripheral stroma ( for example , collagen 19 , 20 ) , leaving poten - tially more compliant regions in the underlying cancerous core insensitive to detection . On the other hand , the relevance of single cell measurements has been questioned given the lack of a proper three - dimensional tissue environment 21 . The diversity of biomechanical proﬁles underscores the impor - tance of obtaining a holistic understanding of malignancy and how it manifests in breast tumours . This includes correlating biome - chanical and microenvironmental properties at different stages of cancer progression . In this Article , we report on a comprehensive effort to correlate the nanomechanical properties of native human breast biopsies to speciﬁc histopathological markers in healthy tissue and in benign and malignant tumours . As a standard animal model , our human biopsy results are validated with systema - tic experiments on MMTV - PyMT ( mouse mammary tumour virus - polyoma middle T antigen ) transgenic mice 22 , which we follow from early cancer to metastasis . In bridging across length scales , our nanomechanical measurements reconcile tumour - level and single - cell measurements in both humans and transgenic mice and reveal unique mechano - markers that can be used to identify differ - ent cancer stages . Moreover , these ﬁndings suggest close correlations between cell softening , tumour hypoxia and lung metastasis . Nanomechanical signatures of human breast biopsies To elucidate and correlate the respective nanomechanical proﬁles to pathohistological ﬁndings in normal , benign and malignant biopsies , we carried out IT - AFM analyses of ex vivo breast tissues under physiological buffer conditions .

All rights reserved for obtaining multiple stiffness maps across entire biopsies is described in Fig . 1a . The tissue architecture and surface integrity of the biopsies were conﬁrmed by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ; Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Plotting a histogram of biopsy - wide stiffness values from a healthy specimen reveals a unimodal stiffness distribution of 1 . 13 + 0 . 78 kPa ( Fig . 1b , top left ) . Healthy ducts deﬁne the histological appearance in haematoxylin & eosin ( H & E ) - stained sections of the mapped specimen ( Fig . 1b , top right ) . The benign ﬁbroadenoma with its characteristic highly ﬁbrotic content shows an increased stiffness of 3 . 68 + 1 . 92 kPa ( Fig . 1b , middle left ) . Softer features ( , 2 kPa ) presumably represent individual ﬁbroblasts embedded in the ﬁbrotic stroma . Post - AFM histological examination of the mapped specimen conﬁrmed ﬁbroblasts to be the dominant cell type within the benign lesion 23 ( Fig . 1b , middle right ) . In comparison , a representative cancer biopsy typically exhibits a bimodal stiffness distribution with two prominent peaks at 0 . 57 + 0 . 16 kPa ( ‘peak 1’ ) and 1 . 99 + 0 . 73 kPa ( ‘peak 2’ ) ( Fig . 1b , bottom left ) . At values stiffer than 2 kPa , a broadening in the distribution indicates a marked mechanical heterogeneity across the sample , with ‘peak 3’ located at 5 . 75 + 1 . 62 kPa . Post - AFM H & E staining conﬁrmed the dominance of tumour cells that inﬁltrate the stroma in a cord - like pattern ( Fig . 1b , bottom right ) . We also assigned individual stiffness peaks to speciﬁc tissue morphologies by performing more detailed measurements within deﬁned regions of the biopsy ( Fig . 2a ) , in particular in the core ( Fig . 2b ) and at the periphery ( Fig . 2c ) . The correlation of local AFM data with matching histologies corroborated that the soft peak is typical for cancer cells ( Fig . 2b ) that are surrounded by stiffer peripheral stroma ( Fig . 2c ) . Individual biopsy - wide stiffness distributions for 30 human biopsies ( 8 healthy , 8 benign and 14 malignant ) are displayed in Supplementary Fig . S2 and peak stiffness values are summarized in Supplementary Table S1 . In general , the nanomechanical signa - ture of healthy breast tissue is characterized by a unimodal distri - bution with peak stiffness from 1 . 13 to 1 . 83 kPa . The stiffness distribution across benign lesions remains uniform ; however , stiff - ness values range from 1 . 91 to 3 . 68 kPa and thus indicate a stiffer phenotype . All 14 biopsies with cancer exhibited a characteristic stiffness proﬁle with a dominant peak at 0 . 31 – 0 . 75 kPa , that is , at least factor of two softer than healthy mammary gland epithelium ( P , 0 . 0001 ) . The nanomechanical signature of cancer included a second peak between 1 . 54 and 1 . 99 kPa .

All rights reserved several malignant biopsies is that the remaining stiffness values are broadly distributed up to (cid:2) 20 kPa . This spread is indicative of the overall loss of mammary gland architecture accompanied by tumour vascularization and inﬁltration , and changes in the invasion - afﬂicted peripheral ECM 19 , 24 . Interestingly , cancer biopsies often demonstrate a distinct minimum ( (cid:2) 1 . 1 – 1 . 5 kPa , Supplementary Fig . S3 ) between the primary and secondary peaks . Because it is inversely correlated to the average stiffness value for healthy breast tissue ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) , we interpret the minimum to arise from the malignant transformation of healthy epithelium .

All rights reserved human breast cancer , to more systematically elucidate the nano - mechanical markers of tumour progression and metastasis 22 . For the corresponding staging of MMTV - PyMT specimens used for stiffness mapping , we monitored the loss of integrin b 1 expression , which accompanies tumour progression 22 ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . The biopsy - wide histogram across a normal mouse mammary gland revealed a unimodal stiffness distribution with a peak of 1 . 02 + 0 . 42 kPa ( Fig . 3a , left ) that is characteristic of healthy mammary tissue , with its well - organized arrangement of densely packed epithelial cells ( Fig . 3a , right ) . The uniform stiffness proﬁle is comparable to that of normal human breast . It should be noted , however , that in contrast to human breast tissues , healthy murine mammary glands exhibit extensive amounts of adipose tissue ( 70 – 80 % ) ( Supplementary Fig . S5a ) . The biopsy - wide histogram of premalignant tissues shows the onset of a bimodal stiffness distribution with peaks at 0 . 95 + 0 . 18 and 1 . 75 + 0 . 27 kPa , as identiﬁed by peak - analysing software . The presence of soft and moderately stiffer features correlates with an increase of stromal components surrounding the proliferative cell masses revealed in H & E stained sections ( Fig . 3b , right ) . In early cancer samples , this trend is more pronounced , resulting from distinct soft and stiff areas ( Fig . 3c , left ) , as demonstrated by the peaks at 0 . 45 + 0 . 12 and 1 . 29 + 0 . 76 kPa , respectively . These correspond to distinct zones of densely packed cancer cells and early stromal invasion , as revealed in H & E stained sections ( Fig . 3c , right ) . A summary of the peak stiffness values that were calculated for murine mammary tissues is presented in Supplementary Table S2 . As mentioned above , adipose tissue is prevalent in murine mammary glands and , because of its softness , could be mistaken for cancer cell clusters . Control experiments on adipose tissues demonstrated that the two cell types could be discriminated by their stiffness ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . Mammary adipocytes exhibit a stiffness of 0 . 31 + 0 . 13 kPa ( Supplementary Fig . S5a , middle ) , whereas cancer cells have a stiffness peak at 0 . 75 + 0 . 25 kPa ( Supplementary Fig . S5b , middle ) .

All rights reserved Among the most substantial structural changes in mammary gland architecture that occur with the transition from normal mammary gland to early cancer are the degradation of the basement membrane that surrounds normal and premalignant glands ( Supplementary Fig . S6 , top ) and the altered expression and organ - ization of collagen I ( Supplementary Fig . S6 , bottom ) . In later stages of tumour progression , stromal contributions increasingly modify cancer behaviour 25 . For example , collagen I , which is the main com - ponent of the ECM , is associated with cancer stiffening 19 , 21 . Therefore , we examined the relation between local nanomechanical proﬁles and ECM structure in late MMTV - PyMT cancer , which corresponds to invasive ductal carcinomas in humans . Sequential stiffness maps across the specimen demonstrate gradual stiffening from the core to the periphery ( Fig . 4a ) , with peak values shifting from 0 . 74 + 0 . 26 kPa in the core to 5 . 51 + 1 . 70 kPa at the periphery ( Fig . 4b ) . At the same time , mechanical heterogeneity increases and is most extensive at the periphery . These changes appear to be associated with distinct changes in the ECM , as revealed by sub - sequent immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) analysis ( Fig . 4c ) . In particular , collagen I is not detected in the soft core but is increasingly present towards the periphery ( Fig . 4c , top ) . Also , laminin - 1 expression is virtually absent from the core ( Fig . 4c , bottom left ) , as expected in advanced cancer where the basement membrane has disintegrated 26 . However , the increased vasculariza - tion of the mid and peripheral areas resulted in laminin - 1 staining of vessel basement membranes ( Fig . 4c , bottom middle and right ) . We conclude that the absence of laminin - 1 and collagen I in the core regions contributes to the soft phenotype of cancer cells . On the other hand , the increased staining of laminin - 1 and collagen I towards the periphery marks the increase of stromal invasion related to stiffening in the respective regions .

All rights reserved late tumour stages that is reﬂected in the broad range of stiffness values ( Fig . 4b ) . The indications that the stiffness signatures are based on distinct changes in the cytoarchitecture and ECM in MMTV - PyMT trans - genic mice prompted us to follow up on this correlation in human breast cancer biopsies ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . Overall , the staining patterns in human biopsies diagnosed with invasive cancer were similar to those observed in the late cancer stage of MMTV - PyMT mammary tissues ( Fig . 4 , Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . At the cellular level , a distinct expression of desmin and vimentin , both markers of epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , was found in cancer cells , but also in the adjacent stroma of the invasive lobular ( Supplementary Fig . S7c ) and ductal ( Supplementary Fig . S7d ) carcinomas . We therefore rationalize that the soft pheno - type detected in human cancer biopsies ( Supplementary Fig . S2 , Table S1 ) is an indication of tumour progression . A soft hypoxic cell phenotype is conducive to metastasis We next asked whether the very soft cancer phenotypes could be associated with the ability to metastasize to distant sites , in particular to the lungs where metastases frequently occur in MMTV - PyMT mice at late stages of tumour progression 27 , 28 . Stiffness measurements from lungs of mice bearing late - stage tumours reveal an extremely soft peak ( Supplementary Fig . S8a ) that is absent in healthy lungs ( Supplementary Fig . S8b ; statistical differences between specimens are presented in Supplementary Table S3 ) . Most importantly , with a stiffness peak of 0 . 45 + 0 . 15 kPa , the softest nanomechanical pheno - type present at the primary tumour site ( Fig . 5a ) closely corresponds to the stiffness of a metastatic lesion obtained from the lungs of the same mouse ( 0 . 56 + 0 . 26 kPa , Fig . 5b ) . Because a hypoxic core is a key feature of aggressive cancers 29 , we examined whether the nanomechanical changes associated with cancer progression are related to reduced tumour oxygenation by injecting MMTV - PyMT mice at distinct stages of tumour progression with pimonidazole ( a probe that selectively binds to hypoxic cells ) , 90 min before tumour excision . As expected , normal glands and pre - malignant lesions were negative for hypoxia ( Fig . 6 , top left and middle ) . In contrast , early cancer exhibited central hypoxia ( Fig . 6 , right ) that correlated well with a signiﬁcant decrease of cell stiffness ( Fig . 3c , left ; Supplementary Table S2 ) . In late cancer , dissemination of hypoxic cancer cells to areas of stromal invasion and to the tumour periphery ( Fig . 6 , bottom left ) adds to the mechanical heterogeneity observed in these regions ( Fig . 4b ) . Moreover , their presence suggests that a decreased stiffness is able to promote the metastatic spread of soft cells to the lungs ( Fig . 5 ) . The role of mechanical properties in cancer development and pro - gression has prompted high - powered research initiatives worldwide . Several studies in recent years have led to the notion that tumours are generally stiffer than healthy tissue 30 and that continuous tissue stiffening is a promoter of cancer 10 , 31 . Contrary to this dogma , there are numerous studies reporting that single isolated cancer cells are signiﬁcantly softer than normal cells 32 . However , two - dimensional systems do not recapitulate the architecture or surrounding forces to which a cell is exposed in its native tissue environment 7 , 33 . Here , our work resolves the stiffness paradox by exploiting the nanomecha - nical sensitivity of IT - AFM 34 and its unprecedented spatial resolution to comprehensively investigate the mechanical properties of native breast biopsies from human patients ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . The most striking ﬁnding is that normal glandular tissue , benign lesions and malignant tumours exhibit qualitatively unique biome - chanical signatures that are reproducible across different patients . Malignancies are recognized by two features : ( i ) mechanical hetero - geneity in line with histological appearance and ( ii ) a characteristic stiffness peak of 0 . 5 – 0 . 8 kPa measured in areas with densely packed tumour cells and little intervening stroma .

All rights reserved unimodal stiffness distribution with peaks at (cid:2) 1 kPa and (cid:2) 3 kPa , respectively . In fact , signature - based diagnoses in double - blind exper - iments correlate nearly 100 % with conventional histopathology of the same biopsy post - AFM . Detecting solid breast lesions by differential tissue elasticity is also the underlying principle in sonoelastography , which has emerged as a clinical , non - invasive diagnostic technique in recent years 35 . However , the length scale of this approach does not allow for a reliable distinction of benign and malignant breast masses 36 , 37 . This challenge is uniquely met by IT - AFM , which is able to differentiate between cancer and benign lesions by correlat - ing stiffness measurements resolved at the nanometre scale across the entire length of a biopsy . Conclusions We have resolved the nanomechanical signatures of deﬁned stages of tumour progression , including metastasis . Most notably , high - resolution stiffness mapping has revealed that cancer progression is not limited to matrix stiffening , as previously assumed 10 , but is associated with a signiﬁcant softening of tumour epithelial cells in comparison to normal mammary epithelium . This distinctive softening probably went unnoticed in a recent AFM study 32 , because the 5 m m colloidal probe that was used only allowed for bulk measurements that did not provide sufﬁcient resolution to distinguish between the individual tissue components ( that is , the cells and ECM 32 , 38 ) . Tumour progression to the late , invasive stage accentuates the soft peak and brings about a broaden - ing of the stiffness distribution ( Fig . 4 ) as a result of the cancer cells inﬁltrating the surrounding tissue , as well as stromal disorganization and tumour vascularization 31 . Recent evidence shows that hypoxia promotes tumour invasion and ultimately metastases , and thus is associated with tumour aggressiveness 38 , 39 . Also , it has long been hypothesized in the ﬁeld that metastatic cells need a certain degree of ﬂexibility and deform - ability to escape their original niche 40 – 42 . By analysing metastatic lesions in lungs from MMTV - PyMT mice we now provide the ﬁrst evidence that supports this hypothesis . These data indicate a direct link between cancer cell softening in the primary tumour and aggressive behaviour leading to metastases . In conclusion , soft peaks detected in the primary tumour may serve not only as mechanobiological markers for the onset of cancer but have prog - nostic qualities as well . Methods Human biopsies . Human biopsies were obtained from the outpatient breast clinic , Department of Gynecology and Gynecological Oncology , University Hospital Basel . The study was approved by the institutional review board ( ref . no . EK : 157 / 08 ) and conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines . Patient recruitment was carried out with informed consent . For each patient , one out of ﬁve biopsies was used for IT - AFM analysis directly after removal , without previous knowledge of clinical data . The other four biopsies were evaluated by standard pathological procedures . Cylindrical specimens with a diameter of (cid:2) 0 . 2 cm and length of 0 . 2 – 1 cm were biopsied from suspicious lesions under ultrasound guidance ( Fig . 1a ) . Biopsies were immediately transferred to ice - cold isotonic Ringer solution ( 6 . 00 g NaCl , 0 . 40 g KCl , 50 g anhydric glucose , 0 . 27 g CaCl 2 , 3 . 20 g lactic acid per 1 , 000 ml of distilled water ) supplemented with glucose and a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Complete , Boehringer Mannheim ; 1 tablet per 10 ml ) and kept at 4 8 C to minimize tissue degradation . IT - AFM analysis was performed no later than three days after biopsy . Mammary and lung tissue samples from MMTV - PyMT mice . All procedures involving mice were conducted in accordance with the Swiss laws regulating the use and care of animals in research and have been reviewed and approved by the Federal veterinary ofﬁce . Female mice heterozygous for the PyMT transgene were obtained by breeding male PyMT mice on a FVB background with FVB females lacking the PyMT transgene . Micewere killed at different time points of tumour development 22 , and mammary tissues and lungs from at least six different mice were immediately excised and placed in ice - cold Ringer solution .

All rights reserved ( Supplementary Fig . S9 ) and tissue integrity intact as judged by RNA stability ( Supplementary Fig . S9 and Supplementary Information on RNA isolation ) . For hypoxia assessment , mice were injected intraperitoneally with pimonidazole hydrochloride at 100 mg ml 2 1 in 0 . 9 % sterile saline solution ( 120 mg kg 2 1 , hypoxyprobe - 1 , HPI ) . After 90 min , mice were killed and tissue specimens taken for IT - AFM . Hypoxia was demonstrated by immunohistochemical analysis of pimonidazole incorporation according to a standard protocol 42 . IT - AFM and data analysis . All preparative steps were performed in a sterile buffer environment supplemented with protease inhibitors . Each specimen was immobilized on a plastic dish with a thin layer of two - component fast drying epoxy glue ( Devcon ) . Mechanical manipulations during sample preparation were kept minimal at all times . To level out the surface to be scanned , small wedges were placed under uneven specimens . IT - AFM was carried out with a noise - isolated FlexAFM ARTIDIS ( Nanosurf AG ) and a Nanowizard I atomic force microscope ( JPK Instruments ) . To compensate for largesurfacecorrugations onsuch native biological samples , we developed and implemented customized homebuilt hardware and software algorithms for automated levelling , which enabled uninterrupted AFM operation during data acquisition ( see Supplementary Information on Automated levelling ) . A top - down microscope ( S8AP0 with Imagesource DFK 31F03 , Leica ) was used to visually position the AFM cantilever with respect to the specimen . Four - sided pyramidal tips ( 205 - m m - long DNP - S10 triangular silicon nitride cantilevers , resonance frequency ( air ) f ¼ 18 kHz , nominal cantilever spring constant k ¼ 0 . 06 Nm 2 1 , tip radius ¼ 20 nm , half - open angle of the pyramidal face of u ≈ 35 8 , Bruker ) were used . The exact spring constant k of the cantilever was determined before each experiment using the thermal tune method 43 and the deﬂection sensitivity was determined in ﬂuid using glass substrates as an inﬁnitely stiff reference material . IT - AFM at room temperature involved recording up to 22 different 20 × 20 m m 2 force – volume maps over 24 × 24 point grids ( 576 force – displacement curves per map and a pixel size of 833 nm ) and for high spatial resolution 72 × 72 point grids ( 5 , 184 force – displacement curves per map and a pixel size of 277 nm ) were recorded . Force – volume maps spaced at 500 m m apart were acquired in a systematic manneracrossthe entire sample surface ( Fig . 1a ) . Individual force curves consistedof 512 data points , with a Z piezo - displacement between 5 and 8 m m , which were collected at 0 . 8 – 1 load / unload cycles per second . The maximum applied loading force was set to 1 . 8 nN , which gave indentation depths that varied approximately between 150 and 3 , 000 nm depending on the intrinsic mechanical differences within each biopsy ( examples are shown in Supplementary Fig . S10 ) . Force curves were analysed using the Oliver and Pharr method 44 as described previously 45 – 47 . See Supplementary Methods on Oliverand Pharranalysis for further details . The stiffness values ( Pa ¼ N m 2 2 ) calculated from force curves were spatially plotted to yield colour - coded stiffness maps in Igor Pro 6 . 22 ( Wavemetrics ) . A two - dimensional spline interpolation was performed on the stiffness maps to smooth the visual presentation of the data . Statistics . A total of 30 human breast biopsies from female patients ( Supplementary Table S1 ) and 27 mammary glands and 6 lungs obtained from 13 MMTV - PyMT mice were analysed . All individual stiffness values for a specimen were summarized in OriginPro 8 . 5 ( Microcal ) to obtain the distribution of stiffness values ( henceforth deﬁned as biopsy - wide histogram ) . The bin width was set to 200 Paforall mammary gland specimens and 500 Pa for the murine lungs . Counts were normalized according to the total amount of measured stiffness values per specimen . For data ﬁtting , peaks were located with the peak analysis application of OriginPro . Subsequently , a multi - peak ﬁt was applied to the stiffness distribution . All data are given as mean + standard deviation . The statistical signiﬁcance of differences in mean values was assessed with the paired Student’s t - test in OriginPro 8 . 5 . Statistical signiﬁcance was set at P ≤ 0 . 05 . Immunohistochemical analysis . After IT - AFM , all samples were retrieved , formalin - ﬁxed and parafﬁn - embedded according to standard histological procedures . Sections with a thickness of (cid:2) 5 m m were cut and transferred onto coated glass slides . The ﬁrst and last slides of sequential sections were routinely stained with H & E . Subsequent histopathological examination included assessing the type of lesion ( invasive ductal carcinoma , ﬁbroadenoma and so on ) and a number of standard histopathological markers ( extent of tumour inﬁltration , ﬁbrosis , necrosis and lymphocytic inﬁltration ) . For IHC analysis of the remaining slides of human mammary tissues , the following antibodies were used : anti - collagen I ( 1 : 80 ; Biologo CO2111 ) , anti - laminin ( 1 : 25 ; Thermo RB - 082 - A , Thermo Scientiﬁc ) , anti - vimentin ( prediluted , Ventana 790 - 2917 , Roche Diagnostics ) , anti - desmin ( prediluted , Ventana 760 - 2513 , Roche Diagnostics ) . IHC analysis of murine tissue sections for laminin was performed in the same manner as for human sections . In addition , murine sections were stained with anti - b 1 integrin ( 1 : 50 , Abcam , ab52971 ) and anti - mouse collagen I ( 1 : 800 , Abcam , ab34710 ) . In some cases , sections were treated for antigen retrieval by heat or with 10 mM Tris buffer , 1 mM EDTA , pH 9 . 0 and citrate buffer , pH 6 . 0 . For collagen staining of human biopsies , sections were pre - treated with pepsin for 30 min at room temperature . Avidin / biotin was used for blocking non - speciﬁc binding of the primary antibody . For immunolabelling , sections were incubated with 100 m l antibodies correspondingly diluted in 10 mM PBS , pH 7 . 6 and 0 . 1 % sodium azide . Staining was visualized with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated secondary antibodies ( DakoCytomation ) . Sections were examined with an upright light microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) at the magniﬁcations indicated .
