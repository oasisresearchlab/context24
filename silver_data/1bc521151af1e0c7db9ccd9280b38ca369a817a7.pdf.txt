However , not much is known about the factors that influence the effectiveness of using avatars to enhance creativity . In this study we investigate experimentally whether the degree to which users identify with their avatar moderates their actual ability to generate creative ideas . The results suggest that a non - creative avatar ( office worker stereotype ) diminishes creativity , but our creative avatar ( artist stereotype ) does not augment creativity . The similarity in appearance between the user and its avatar positively moderates , whereas its perceived embodiment with the avatar negatively moderates the ability to generate creative ideas . However , the study also suggests that self - similarity might be an even more effective way to support creative ideation than priming creative stereotypes . Therefore , this study ( i ) contributes that self - similarity and embodiment moderate the effectiveness of using an avatar to prime creative stereotypes to enhance creative ideation , and ( ii ) points toward a novel way to enhance creative ideation in virtual environments , by using avatars that look just like yourself .

INTRODUCTION Creative ideation , the ability to generate ideas that are original yet effective , plays an essential role in well - being , innovation , and culture [ 1 ] . Given that people spend a considerable amount of time in 3D virtual environments , i . e . digital environments that mimic physical spaces , and where people interact via avatars [ 2 ] , it is of interest to investigate new ways in which creative ideation can be supported within such environments [ 3 , 4 ] . Avatars , the virtual beings users control to interact within the virtual environment [ 5 ] , may therefore pose such an opportunity . Avatar studies suggest that an avatar’s appearance can prime a user’s actual behaviour [ 6 ] . Avatars designed based on creative stereotypes ( e . g . an inventor ) , can prime creative behaviours that support creative ideation in virtual environments [ 3 , 4 ] . However , not much is known about the factors that underlie the effectiveness of this approach . This may be due to the degree to which users identify with their avatar . The visual similarity between a user and its avatar , i . e . self - similarity , can positively impact task performance [ 7 , 8 ] , and the degree to which a user believes the avatar’s body is its own , i . e . perceived embodiment , appears to moderate the effectiveness of the ability of an avatar to prime behavior [ 9 , 10 ] . This suggests that self - similarity and embodiment moderate the effectiveness of avatars as support for creative ideation . To investigate this , we experimentally test whether self - similar avatars designed based on creative stereotypes can be used to influence creative ideation ; and the role of self - similarity and embodiment therein . THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Recent studies suggest that avatars can be used as a way to enhance creative ideation in virtual environments [ 3 , 4 ] . The visual appearance of an avatar can prime the way people think and act [ 6 ] . For instance , using an avatar that looks like a Ku Klux Klan member leads to writing more negative stories [ 7 ] ; while using an avatar that is taller and more attractive than its user can increase self - confidence [ 6 ] , and enhances game performance [ 8 ] . Thus , these studies suggest that people can be primed by the appearance of their avatars . This is referred to as The Proteus effect [ 6 ] . Creative stereotypes can prime creative behaviours [ 11 ] . When asked to generate original uses for an object ( e . g . a brick ) , taking the perspective of a rigid librarian led people to produce less original ideas , than when asked to take the perspective of an eccentric poet . Thus , priming creative stereotypes can be used to influence creative behaviour .

Indeed , recent work suggests that using an avatar that looks like an inventor , compared to a neutral looking avatar helps people to think of more , and more original ideas during a face - to - face brainstorming task [ 3 ] . Furthermore , avatars can also influence the type of ideas people generate . For instance , when asked to generate ideas for smart windows in public transportation , using an inventor avatar led to more technology focused ideas , whereas using a public transport user avatar led to ideas about improving practical needs [ 4 ] . Thus , using avatars designed based on creative stereotypes can influence actual creative ideation . We refer to this as the creative Proteus effect . This leads to hypothesis H1 . H1 : Using a creative avatar augments creative ideation , whereas a non - creative avatar diminishes creative ideation . Although the creative Proteus effect has been demonstrated in previous work , not much is known about the factors that influence or underlie its effectiveness [ cf . 3 , 4 ] . We propose that the degree to which a user identifies with its avatar moderates the effectiveness of the creative Proteus effect . In this study , we focus specifically on the role of self - similarity and perceived embodiment . Self - similarity can influence task performance [ 7 , 12 ] . For instance , computer game players perform better when they use an avatar that looks like , rather than not looks like themselves [ 7 ] ; and teams represented by avatars similar to the team members enhances team performance [ 12 ] . This can be explained by a positive effect of self - similarity emotional involvement and positive affect experienced when using the avatar [ 8 ] . Although no studies on the link between self - similar avatars and creative ideation have been done ; its positive effects on task performance [ 7 , 8 , 11 ] ; and a link between positive affect , emotional involvement , and creative ideation [ 13 ] ; suggest that self - similarity can influence creative ideation . This leads to hypothesis H2 . H2 : The similarity of an avatar to the user itself moderates the effects of using an avatar designed based on creative stereotypes on creative ideation . The ( creative ) Proteus effect also seems conditional upon the perceived embodiment of an avatar by its user [ 9 , 10 ] . This depends on achieving a complex of factors involving a sense of self location , a sense of agency and a sense of body ownership [ 14 ] . For instance , when people view an avatar that is eating healthy or unhealthy food ; their own tendency to imitate this behaviour depends on the degree to which they feel present themselves within the virtual environment [ 15 ] . If we assume that the Proteus effect is dependent on a particular degree of perceived embodiment , we can assume that the effectiveness of the creative Proteus effect is also dependent thereon . This leads to hypothesis H3 . H3 : The perceived embodiment of an avatar moderates the effects of using an avatar designed based on creative stereotypes on creative ideation . METHOD To test our conjectures , we devised and executed an experiment with a between - subjects design . Participants In total , 61 people participated in our study ( 49 Female , 12 Male , M age = 23 . 62 , SD age = 3 . 54 , Range age = 18 - 32 ) . Participants were recruited using convenience sampling at the communication and information sciences department , Tilburg University ( NL ) , in exchange for course credit . Participants were assigned randomly to the experimental conditions , and the researchers were aware the assignments . Materials and measurements Creative ideation task The instances task was used as a proxy to test creative ideation [ 16 ] . In this task participants are asked to generate creative instances of objects characterised by a particular feature ( in our study things shaped like a circle or triangle ) within three minutes . Participants were explicitly instructed to be creative . To assess creativity participants selected their top two most creative ideas after the creative ask ; after which three independent raters scored these ideas for their creativity on a scale from 1 - 10 [ 16 ] . Raters were instructed to rate creativity as a composite of originality and effectiveness . The means of their ratings per participant were used in further analyses . Cronbach alpha was low , α = . 47 , a common reliability level for creativity ratings [ 17 ] . Creative avatars and virtual environment To test our hypotheses participants performed the creative task using one of three avatars ( Fig . 1 ) : ( i ) Creative avatar , an avatar wearing a white painter’s blouse with paint stains and paint brushes ( n = 19 ) , and was chosen because artistic jobs are stereotypically associated with creative behaviour [ 18 ] ; ( ii ) Non - creative avatar , an avatar wearing a grey office - like jacket with a necktie ( n = 19 ) , and was chosen because office jobs are stereotypically associated with non - creative behaviour [ 19 ] ; ( iii ) Control avatar , an avatar wearing the clothes the participant is actually wearing ( n = 23 ) , and for which we expect no creative Proteus effect . The avatar was used in a virtual room ( Fig . 2 ) : a minimally designed living room of medium size , with three couches , three plants , a door , and a window with a city street view . We assumed this would minimise any confounds that may arise from avatar - environment interactions ( e . g . affect its stereotypical interpretation ) , and minimise the chance that the room itself would inspire any ideas during the task . The avatars were generated using the body - scanning and auto - rigging software by [ 5 ] . During the body - scan , participants wore the clothes stereotypical of the described experimental conditions . The virtual room was presented using a head mounted display [ 20 ] . Self - similarity Using body scanning to generate the avatars ensured similarity in visual appearance between the user and the avatar [ 5 ] . Self - similarity was assessed after the creative Session : Posters and Technology Demonstrations C & C 2017 , June 27 – 30 , 2017 , Singapore 233 task with a questionnaire that contained the first four questions used by [ 21 ] , and the question used [ 22 ] . Cronbach’s alpha showed acceptable reliability , α = . 82 . Figure 1 Examples of the avatars used in the experimental conditions . The non - creative avatar ( left ) , creative avatar ( middle ) , control avatar , wearing their own clothes ( right ) . Figure 2 The virtual reality environment that was used in the three experimental conditions . Embodiment To stimulate perceived embodiment participants were asked to imagine they were the avatar , were looking in a mirror and saw themselves . The avatar’s movement was animated to approximate the movements of their users , i . e . small arm , leg , and head movements . Embodiment was assessed after the experiment using the presence questionnaire by [ 15 ] . Cronbach alpha suggested acceptable reliability , α = . 80 . Procedure Participants were introduced to the study and signed informed consent . At this stage information about the actual purpose of the study was withheld . For the creative and non - creative avatar condition they put on selected clothing , were body - scanned ( see [ 5 ] ) , and then removed the selected clothing again . Participants filled in a questionnaire about their demographics while the researcher animated the avatar and rendered the virtual environment . Participants were then asked to stand up and put on the head mounted display , were reminded of the task , and did the embodiment manipulation . Then , participants executed the creative task in virtual reality . After this , they selected their two most creative ideas , and filled in the self - similarity and embodiment questionnaires . Finally , they were debriefed . RESULTS To test our hypotheses we used four linear mixed models . The models and results are presented in Table 1 . The descriptive statistics are presented in Table 2 .

Interestingly , using the control avatar associates with higher creative ideation that using the non - creative and , although not significantly , the creative avatar ( Table 2 ) . Thus , using our non - creative avatar diminishes creativity , but using our creative avatar does not influence creativity . This only partly supports H1 .

Thus , increased self - similarity of an avatar augments creative ideation , while perceived embodiment , surprisingly , diminishes creativity . This supports H2 , but inversely supports H3 . Model 3 : The results replicate the findings in model 1 and model 2 ( Table 1 ) . In addition , there was no significant difference between the interaction of self - similarity with the control avatar , with the creative avatar , B = - 78 , t ( 61 ) = - 1 . 82 , p = . 083 , and with the non - creative avatar , B = , - . 27 t ( 61 ) = - . 73 , p = . 464 . Similarly , there was no significant difference between the interaction of embodiment with the control avatar , B = . 97 , t ( 61 ) = 1 . 55 , p = . 166 , with the creative avatar , and with the non - creative avatar , B = . 77 , t ( 61 ) = 1 . 45 , p = . 090 . This suggests that self - similarity and embodiment moderate the effects of using an avatar designed based on creative stereotypes on creative ideation across the experimental conditions . This confirms our findings on H1 , and further supports H2 and H3 . Model 4 : The results replicate the findings from model 1 ( Table 1 ) , but add to the findings in model 2 and 3 . Self - similarity did not significantly predict creative ideation for the creative , B = - . 09 , t ( 61 ) = - . 27 , p = . 804 , and not for the non - creative avatar , B = . 41 , t ( 61 ) = 1 . 52 , p = . 197 . Rather , self - similarity was a significant positive predictor of creative ideation for the control avatar , B = . 68 , t ( 61 ) = 2 . 71 , p = . 001 . Similarly , embodiment did not significantly predict creative ideation for the creative , B = - . 05 , t ( 61 ) = - . 09 , p = . 948 , and the non - creative avatar , B = - . 25 , t ( 61 ) = - . 63 , p = . 499 ; but did significantly and negatively predict creative ideation for the control avatar , B = - 1 . 02 , t ( 61 ) = - 2 . 83 , p = . 002 . This suggests that self - similarity and embodiment may moderate creative ideation mostly when there is no creative Proteus effect manipulation . This again confirms H1 , but sheds new light on H2 and H3 . DISCUSSION This study shows that avatars designed based on creative stereotypes can influence actual creative ideation , and reveals two factors that influence its effectiveness . Using an avatar designed based on a creative stereotype ( a visual artist ) , did not augment creativity , but using an avatar designed based on a non - creative stereotype ( an office worker ) did diminish creative ideation ( H1 ) . This replicates in part earlier work by [ 3 , 4 ] . This study also shows , for the first time , that the similarity of an avatar to the user itself positively , and its perceived embodiment negatively moderates creative ideation ( H2 and H3 ) . Thus , self - similarity and embodiment appear to moderate the effectiveness of the creative Proteus effect . Interestingly , using an avatar that looks like the user does at that moment ( control avatar ) led to more creative ideation than using the creative and the non - creative avatar ; and upon further inspection , self - similarity and embodiment appeared to moderate creative ideation in particular for the control avatar . This suggests that self - similarity in itself might also be an effective way to support creativity . As such , these findings cast doubt on ( i ) the effectiveness of the creative Proteus effect , and possibly point to ( ii ) another , novel , way to support creative ideation using self - similar avatars , i . e . via a “Being yourself” effect [ cf . 7 , 8 ] . We would like to discuss two limitations in detail because they point to our intended future work . First , we only partly replicated earlier findings by [ 3 , 4 ] that suggest that avatars can be used to prime creative behaviour . It appears that , despite earlier findings [ 18 ] , our artist stereotype was not an effective prime [ cf . 11 ] . Future work can therefore benefit from studies that test what creative stereotypes are effective primes . However , using highly self - similar avatars might also explain this replication issue . If there really exists a “Being yourself” effect , this introduces a confounding factor into the control avatar , which limits drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of the creative Proteus effect . This requires confirmation in a dedicated study . Second , using body - scanned avatars may introduce confounds that limit the generalisation of self - similarity and embodiment as moderators of the creative Proteus effect . Likely , body - scanning introduces issues that associate with the uncanny valley ( Figure 1 ) , i . e . eeriness and revulsion elicited by avatars that almost , but just not , look human - like [ 23 ] . If so , self - similarity may positively predict creativity because it lifts the avatar’s appearance out of the uncanny valley ; decreasing negative affect . Perceived embodiment may be a particular issue when avatars are perceived as uncanny , intensifying negative affect , which diminishes creative ideation [ cf . 13 ] . The findings can therefore only be generalised to the use of highly self - similar avatars , suggesting that also here further research is required . Of course , there are several more limitations to the results and some with relevance for the result’s generalisability . These include the notion that whether or not the used avatars are perceived as a creative stereotype can be dependent on for instance culture [ 24 ] , gender [ 25 ] , and ( virtual ) environment [ 26 ] , which may moderate the intended effect of the stereotypes ; Participants in two of the three conditions wore the stereotypes’ clothes during scanning , which may have unduly contributed to the priming effects [ 26 ] ; The scan quality might have influence across all conditions , e . g . higher quality scan methods may lead to different results [ 27 ] ; and finally , the creativity measure itself is subjective and dependent on cultural factors , further limiting generalisability [ 1 , 28 ] , but see [ 16 ] . We would like to emphasise that these limitations need to be taken into account when interpreting and building upon our study and its results . In summary , this study ( i ) contributes that self - similarity and embodiment moderate the effectiveness of using an avatar to prime creative stereotypes , and ( ii ) it points Session : Posters and Technology Demonstrations C & C 2017 , June 27 – 30 , 2017 , Singapore 235 toward a novel way to enhance creative ideation in virtual environments , by using avatars that look just like yourself .
