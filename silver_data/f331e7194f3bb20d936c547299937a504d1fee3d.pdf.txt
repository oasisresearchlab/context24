We deﬁne two molecular pathways that activate the Arp2 / 3 complex during neuroblast migration in Caenorhabditis elegans . The transmem - brane protein MIG - 13 / Lrp12 is linked to the Arp2 / 3 nucleation - promoting factorsWAVEorWASP through directinteractionswithABL - 1orSEM - 5 / Grb2 , respec - tively . WAVE mutations partially impaired F - actin organization and decelerated cell migration , and WASP mutations did not inhibit cell migration but enhanced migration defects in WAVE - deﬁcient cells . Puriﬁed SEM - 5 and MIG - 2 synergistically stimulated the F - actin branching activity of WASP - Arp2 / 3 in vitro . In GFP knockin animals , WAVE and WASP were largely organized into separate clusters at the leading edge , and the amount of WASP was less than WAVE but could be elevated by WAVE mutations . Our results indicate that the MIG - 13 - WAVE pathway provides the major force for directional cell motility , whereas MIG - 13 - WASP partially compensates for its loss , underscoring their coordinated activities in facilitating robust cell migration . INTRODUCTION The ability of a migratory cell to respond to extracellular signals requires global and dynamic rearrangements of the actin cyto - skeleton ( Pollard and Cooper , 2009 ; Skau and Waterman , 2015 ; Swaney and Li , 2016 ) . While immense progress has been achieved in delineating signaling events at transmembrane receptors and establishing the molecular features of actin nucle - ation , it remains elusive how the signals are transduced to the actin cytoskeleton that executes the motility response in the cor - rect direction . Therefore , the identiﬁcation of molecular connec - tions that integrate multiple signals to regulate actin assembly is of fundamental importance to our understanding of directional cell migration in vivo . At the leading edge of a migrating cell , Arp2 / 3 - catalyzed actin nucleation leads to a burst of actin polymerization that pushes the membrane forward ( Pollard and Cooper , 2009 ; Rotty et al . , 2013 ; Swaney and Li , 2016 ) . The nucleation activity of Arp2 / 3 re - quires nucleation - promoting factors such as the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and WASP - family verprolin - homolo - gous protein ( WAVE ) family proteins , which induce a conforma - tional change in Arp2 / 3 and recruit the ﬁrst actin monomer of the new ﬁlament ( Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ; Skau and Waterman , 2015 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ; Thrasher and Burns , 2010 ) . Transmembrane proteins and membrane - associated pro - teins were found to interact with WASP and WAVE , making them scaffolds that transduce the upstream signals to Arp2 / 3 activa - tion . More than 120 membrane - binding proteins contain the WAVE interacting receptor sequence that directly binds to a conserved surface on the WAVE complex ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . Perturbation of this interaction disrupts in actin organization during Drosophila oogenesis and collective follicle cell migration as well as Caenorhabditis elegans synapse formation and axon branching ( Chen et al . , 2014 ; Chia et al . , 2014 ; Squarr et al . , 2016 ) . However , many other transmembrane proteins do not contain this motif , and the signal transduction from them to the actin assembly must rely on additional mechanisms . Functional studies of Arp2 / 3 , WAVE , and WASP in cell migra - tion have been severely hindered by cell lethality observed upon the loss of these components ( Pollard and Cooper , 2009 ; Swa - ney and Li , 2016 ) . A viable ﬁbroblast line was established from Ink4a / Arf - deﬁcient mice that supports near complete and stable depletion of Arp2 / 3 by RNAi , and these cells respond normally to platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) - mediated chemotaxis but not to a surface - bound gradient of extracellular matrix during haptotaxis ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) . However , mouse ﬁbroblasts that are differentiated from embryonic stem cells with a homozygous disruption of the gene encoding an Arp2 / 3 subunit ( ARPC3 ) are defective in persistent chemotactic movement toward an epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) gradient ( Suraneni et al . , 2012 , 2015 ) , implying that different cell types employ Arp2 / 3 distinctly for directional cell migration . This complexity , demonstrated in cultured cell lines , re - emphasizes that the study of Arp2 / 3 , WAVE , and WASP in regulating cell motility in live animals , which is currently limited , may be even more challenging than previ - ously thought . The C . elegans Q neuroblasts offer a tractable experimental system by which to dissect the genetic pathways that coordinate membrane receptors and Arp2 / 3 for directional cell migration . During the ﬁrst larval stage , the Q neuroblasts , QR on the right 224 Developmental Cell 39 , 224 – 238 , October 24 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . side of the animal and QL on the left , undergo an identical pattern of asymmetric cell divisions and differentiation ( Sulston and Hor - vitz , 1977 ) . The Q cell progenies migrate to highly stereotypic positions along the anterior / posterior body axis but in opposite directions , with QR and descendants ( abbreviated as QR . x ) moving anteriorly and QL and descendants ( QL . x ) moving poste - riorly ( Figure 1A ) . The Wnt / b - catenin signaling pathway provides the attractive cue for the posterior migration of QL . x ( Mentink et al . , 2014 ; Whangbo and Kenyon , 1999 ) . QR . x cells appear to be less sensitive to attraction by the canonic Wnt signaling compared with QL . x ( Whangbo and Kenyon , 1999 ) but require Wnt components for persistent polarization and motility , anterior migration termination , and switching to the dorsoventral migra - tion phase ( Mentink et al . , 2014 ) . To adopt a speciﬁc migratory response toward the anterior , QR . x cells interpret an as yet un - known anterior guidance signal that is transduced by a trans - membrane protein , MIG - 13 ( Sym et al . , 1999 ; Wang et al . , 2013 ) . The mouse MIG - 13 homolog Lrp12 ( low - density lipopro - tein receptor - related protein 12 ) is expressed in ventrally directed tangential migrating neurons in the developing murine neocortex , and loss of function of Lrp12 inhibits corticogenesis and results in cortical dyslamination and seizure sensitization ( Grote et al . , 2016 ; Schneider et al . , 2011 ) . However , the mech - anistic connections between MIG - 13 / Lrp12 and the actin cyto - skeleton have not been deﬁned . Here , we combine genetic , biochemical , and imaging ap - proaches to identify the ABL kinase homolog ABL - 1 and the growth factor receptor - bound protein 2 , Grb2 / SEM - 5 , as adaptor proteins that connect MIG - 13 to WAVE and WASP , respectively . We show that the MIG - 13 - ABL - 1 - WAVE and MIG - 13 - SEM - 5 - WASP pathways function in a semi - redundant manner to promote Arp2 / 3 - stimulated actin nucleation during directional cell migration in C . elegans . RESULTS MIG - 13 Organizes the Actin Cytoskeleton through the Arp2 / 3 Complex MIG - 13 is predicted to contain an extracellular C1r / C1s , Uegf , Bmp1 ( CUB ) domain , a low - density lipoprotein receptor repeat , a transmembrane domain , and a proline - rich cytoplasmic tail ( Figure 1B ) . Consistent with our early results , MIG - 13 protein evenly localizes on the plasma membrane ( Wang et al . , 2013 ) and the deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of MIG - 13 did not perturb its localization ( Figure S1B ) , indicating that MIG - 13 localization is independent of its tail . To assess the function of MIG - 13 tail ( MIG - 13C ) , we used a CRISPR / Cas9 - assisted homologous recombination technique to precisely remove the region that encodes the cytosolic domain ( amino acids 262 – 362 ) of MIG - 13 ( Dickinson et al . , 2013 ) , generating a mig - 13 ( cas610 ) deletion allele ( Figure 1B ) . Using the ﬁnal anterior position of QR . ap , which will become the AQR neuron , as a measure of the total migration distance , we showed that AQR localized at a more posterior position in mig - 13 ( cas610 ) mutants compared with wild - type ( WT ) animals , indicating the importance of MIG - 13C in cell migration ( Figure 1C ) . While the mutations in cas15 and cas463 inhibit QR . x migration to a level similar level to that of the null allele of mu225 ( Sym et al . , 1999 ) ( Figures 1C and S1A ) , the reduction of QR . x migration in cas610 appears to be less severe than mu225 ( Figure 1C ) , which indicates that cas610 is a partial loss - of - function allele . To address the cellular mechanisms by which the anterior migration of AQR is reduced in mig - 13 mutants , we performed ﬂuorescence time - lapse analysis of cell morphology and the actin cytoskeleton in migrating Q cells ( Ou and Vale , 2009 ) . We depicted the plasma membrane and nucleus using mCherry tagged with a myristoylation signal and a histone , and the actin cytoskeleton using GFP tagged with the actin - binding domain of moesin ( GFP : : moesinABD ) . In WT animals , AQR extends a large lamellipodium that is enriched with F - actin ( Figure 1D and Movie S1 ) . Strikingly , the morphology of the mig - 13 - null AQR was altered , including the formation of a spiky leading edge and the lack of a persistent anterior polarity during migration ( Figures 1E and S1C , 10 min , arrowhead points to the polarity to - ward the dorsal - ventral axis ; Movie S2 ) . The ﬂuorescence inten - sity ratio of GFP : : moesinABD between the leading edge and the rear was reduced from 4 . 2 - fold in WT to 2 . 5 - fold in mig - 13 mu - tants ( Figure 1F ) , indicating the loss of F - actin at the leading edge . Consequently , AQR failed to persistently extend the lamel - lipodium and translocate the cell body toward the anterior , reducing the migration speed from 20 . 8 m m / hr to 4 . 5 m m / hr ( Fig - ure 1G ) . These data demonstrate that MIG - 13 regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton at the leading edge . Inhibition of Arp2 / 3 in cultured cells converts the normal fan - shaped lamellipodia , which are highly enriched with branched actin ﬁlaments , to a spiky cell morphology , which is dominated by ﬁnger - like ﬁlopodia without branched actin ( Suraneni et al . , 2015 ; Wu et al . , 2012 ) . Filopodia - like structures were detected at the leading edge of mig - 13 - deﬁcient cells ( Figures 1E and 1H ; Movie S2 ) , raising the possibility that MIG - 13 regulates the actin cytoskeleton via Arp2 / 3 . To test this , we used a somatic CRISPR / Cas9 strategy in which the Cas9 endonuclease is ex - pressed under the control of the Q cell - speciﬁc promoter P egl - 17 to generate conditional mutants of arx - 1 ( Arp3 ) and arx - 2 ( Arp2 ) ( Shen et al . , 2014 ) . We showed that AQR migration was reduced in arx - 1 - sg or arx - 2 - sg conditional mutants ( Figure 1C ) . The penetrance of cell migration defects in these animals was more subtle than in mig - 13 mutants , likely because Arp2 / 3 is known for its stability ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) and the somatic CRISPR / Cas9 strategy may not have completely removed it ( Fig - ure S1D ) . Alternatively , MIG - 13 may inﬂuence other effectors promoting neuroblast migration independent of Arp2 / 3 . In arx - 2 conditional mutants , the migration speed of AQR was reduced to 9 . 9 m m / hr and the leading edge was transformed into ﬁnger - like ﬁlopodia , characteristic of the loss of branched actin ﬁlaments caused by the disruption of Arp2 / 3 in other cell types ( Figures 1G – 1I and Movie S3 ) . To study the distribution of ARX - 2 , we constructed an ARX - 2 : : GFP knockin strain and quantiﬁed the enrichment of GFP ﬂuorescence at the leading edge ( ARX - 2 : : GFP enrichment , Figures 1J and 1K ) and the per - centage of the leading edge that contained GFP ﬂuorescence ( ARX - 2 : : GFP distribution , Figure 1L ; schematic of the measure - ments in Figure S1F ) . In WT cells , ARX - 2 : : GFP was enriched 2 . 1 - fold from the cytosol and the GFP ﬂuorescence occupied 89 % of the leading - edge periphery . However , ARX - 2 : : GFP enrichment and distribution were reduced to 1 . 7 - fold and 74 % , respectively , in mig - 13 mutants ( Figures 1J – 1L and S1E ) .

MIG - 13 Recruits the Abl Tyrosine Kinase ABL - 1 to the Leading Edge To identify components that function downstream of MIG - 13 , we designed a modiﬁed suppressor screen based on the observa - tion that an ectopic expression of mig - 13 in PQR ( the QL descen - dant ) using the P egl - 46 or P egl - 13 promoter caused PQR to migrate toward the anterior . As a result , PQR in 92 % of P egl - 46 : : mig - 13 and 74 % of P egl - 13 : : mig - 13 animals was positioned to the more anterior region than in WT animals ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . Disruption of MIG - 13 downstream molecules should restore the PQR posterior position . From the screen , we isolated the soem - 1 ( cas452 ) mutant ( i . e . , suppressor of ectopic mig - 13 ) , which suppressed the anterior migration of PQR in 63 % of P egl - 46 : : mig - 13 or 56 % of P egl - 13 : : mig - 13 animals ( Figure 2B ) . Our SNP - SNIP mapping , whole - genome sequencing data , and transgenic rescue suggest that soem - 1 ( cas452 ) corre - sponds to a T - to - A mutation in the unnamed gene Y87G2A . 17 and that this mutation is predicted to alter a conserved histidine at residue 140 to glutamine ( Figure 2C ) . We used the CRISPR / Cas9 technique to generate two putative null alleles : the cas454 allele causes a frameshift and a translational stop at res - idue 32 , and cas455 removes the N - terminal 152 amino acids , including most of the SH2 domain ( Figure 2C ) . cas454 and cas455 respectively rescued 92 % and 80 % of PQR to the WT position in P egl - 46 : : mig - 13 animals ( Figure 2B ) . Together , our genetic data indicate that mutations of soem - 1 suppress the anterior migration of PQR , which is caused by the ectopic expression of mig - 13 . soem - 1 encodes an Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain protein that is homologous to the murine SH2 - domain - containing protein SHD . A previous yeast two - hybrid ( Y2H ) screen identiﬁed an interaction between SHD and the ABL tyrosine kinase ( Oda et al . , 1997 ) , but the relationship has not been pursued further . Given that the Abl kinase regulates cell migration across species ( Colicelli , 2010 ) , we decided to explore this interaction . Our Y2H assays conﬁrmed that the C . elegans Abl kinase homolog ABL - 1 and SOEM - 1 bind to one another . Interestingly , the H140Q point mutation ( cas452 ) in SOEM - 1 abolished this interaction ( Fig - ure 2D ) . Two putative null mutations abl - 1 ( gk565890 ) and abl - 1 ( ok171 ) , which remove the kinase domain , partially restored the PQR position to the WT position in P egl - 46 : : mig - 13 animals ( Figures 2B and 2C ) , further suggesting that SOEM - 1 and ABL - 1 function downstream of MIG - 13 . We next examined whether the cytoplasmic tail of MIG - 13 ( MIG - 13C ) directly interacts with SOEM - 1 or ABL - 1 . Our Y2H assays detected that MIG - 13C binds to the ABL - 1 N terminus ( ABL - 1N , amino acids 1 – 275 ) that contains the SH2 and SH3 domains , but not to SOEM - 1 ( Figure S2B ) . We transfected the Drosophila S2 cells with the full - length MIG - 13 : : GFP and ABL - 1N : : 3 3 FLAG and conﬁrmed the interaction using a coim - munoprecipitation ( Co - IP ) assay with the GFP antibody ( Fig - ure 2E ) . We expressed GFP - tagged ABL - 1 in Q cells and found that ABL - 1 : : GFP was 2 . 2 - fold enriched at the leading edge compared with the cytosolic ﬂuorescence . However , ABL - 1 : : GFP was evenly distributed in the cytosol of mig - 13 mutants ( Figures 2F and 2G ) . Collectively , MIG - 13 directly binds to and recruits ABL - 1 to the leading edge . MIG - 13 Recruits the Adaptor Protein SEM - 5 / Grb2 to the Leading Edge Despite the genetic and cellular interactions described above between ABL - 1 and MIG - 13 , we did not detect any phenotype of AQR migration in an abl - 1 ( ok171 ) null allele ( Figures 2C and 3A ) . We switched to identify additional binding partners of MIG - 13C using Y2H screens . Given that ABL - 1 interacts with MIG - 13C through its SH2 - SH3 domain , we performed candidate Y2H assays between MIG - 13C and other C . elegans SH2 - SH3 domain - containing proteins . An interaction between MIG - 13C and SEM - 5 but not NCK - 1 or CED - 2 was detected ( Figures S3A and S3B ) , and the glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) pull - down assay conﬁrmed that MIG - 13 : : GFP protein binds to SEM - 5 but not NCK - 1 or CED - 2 ( Figure 3B ) . SEM - 5 encodes an ortholog to human Grb2 , which is conven - tionally considered to connect the EGF receptor to the Ras gua - nine nucleotide exchange factor Sos ( Giubellino et al . , 2008 ) . Pre - vious studies indicated that Grb2 directly interacts with various other targets , including proteins essential for actin organization ( Carlier et al . , 2000 ; Giubellino et al . , 2008 ) . SEM - 5 was originally characterized as a downstream component of the LET - 23 EGF receptor that negatively regulates RAS - mediated signal trans - duction during the C . elegans vulva induction ( Clark et al . , 1992 ) . Mutations of sem - 5 cause embryonic lethality , and we generated conditional mutants of sem - 5 in Q cell lineages ( Figures S3C and S3D ) . Because the P egl - 17 promoter also expressed Cas9 in vulva precursor cells , the sem - 5 conditional knockout animals re - produced the vulvaless phenotype that was observed in sem - 5 viable weak alleles ( Figure S3E ) ( Clark et al . , 1992 ) . Next , we showed that the anterior migration of AQR was reduced in 30 % of sem - 5 - sg1 and 16 % of sem - 5 - sg2 conditional mutants ( Fig - ure 3A ) . In sem - 5 - sg1 , the expression of a Cas9 - resistant version of sem - 5 ( msem - 5 ) restored Q cell progenies to the WT position , indicating that the defective AQR migration was caused by sem - 5 mutations ( Figure 3A ) . By constructing a GFP knockin strain of SEM - 5 , we showed that SEM - 5 localized at the leading edge of Q cells and that such a localization was abolished in mig - 13 - deﬁcient Q cells ( Figures 3C and 3D ) . Together , SEM - 5 is another binding partner of MIG - 13 and may be a downstream component of MIG - 13 - mediated signal transduction . ABL - 1 - WAVE and SEM - 5 - WASP Function in Parallel to Promote Cell Migration To test whether ABL - 1 and SEM - 5 act in parallel to regulate AQR migration , we genetically crossed the sem - 5 - sg conditional mutations to the abl - 1 ( ok171 ) null allele .

Strikingly , the double mutations of sem - 5 and abl - 1 severelyenhancedtheanteriormigration defects in sem - 5 single mutants : migration was further slowed down to 7 . 1 m m / hr , F - actin enrichment was reduced to 2 . 3 - fold , and more than 2 . 2 ﬁlopodia - like structures were formed per leading edge ( Figures 3E – 3J ; Movies S4 , S5 , and S6 ) . Collectively , our results indicate that ABL - 1 and SEM - 5 function in parallel to pro - mote Q cell anterior migration . The ectopic formation of ﬁlopodia - likestructuresattheleadingedgesuggeststhattheArp2 / 3activity may be reduced . We sought to understand how ABL - 1 and SEM - 5 regulate the Arp2 / 3 activity during cell migration . Crystallographic results of WAVE suggested that Abl phosphorylation of WAVE may disrupt interaction between the WAVE meander area and SRA1 so that the VCA domain is released and interacts with Arp2 / 3 ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , previous Y2H screens uncovered that Abl kinase binds to Abi , a subunit in the WAVE complex ( Greuber et al . , 2013 ) , and that C . elegans ABL - 1 can directly associate with ABI - 1 , the only C . elegans Abi homolog ( Hurwitz et al . , 2009 ) . Conversely , the adaptor protein Grb2 / SEM - 5 binds to the proline - rich region of N - WASP and stimulates N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 - based actin polymerization ( Carlier et al . , 2000 ; Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . Based on these early results , we postulated that there may be two parallel ABL - 1 - WAVE and SEM - 5 - WASP pathways that connect MIG - 13 to the Arp2 / 3 complex . We examined the function of WAVE and WASP during Q cell migration . To bypass the embryonically essential function of the WAVE complex , we constructed conditional mutants of abi - 1 and wve - 1 . In these animals , 36 % of AQR reduced anterior migration ( Figure 4A ) . In contrast , the WASP deletion mutation of wsp - 1 ( gm324 ) was viable and did not show any abnormality of the AQR ﬁnal position ( Figure 4A ) ( Withee et al . , 2004 ) . Impor - tantly , 80 % of AQR in wsp - 1 ; wve - 1 - sg1 double mutants reduced their anterior migration ( Figure 4A ) , implying that WAVE and WASP act in parallel to promote cell migration . In wsp - 1 mutants , AQR migrated at a normal speed and properly arrived at their destination , although F - actin enrichment was slightly reduced and several ﬁlopodia - like protrusions were generated ( Figures 4B and 4E – 4G ; Movie S7 ) . However , the loss of WVE - 1 decreased F - actin enrichment and produced more ﬁlopodia - like structures , causing a signiﬁcant reduction in migration speed ( Figures 4C and 4E – 4G ; Movie S8 ) . The double mutation of wsp - 1 and wve - 1 eliminated the localization of F - actin at the leading edge and almost stopped cell migration ( 3 . 9 m m / hr ) . Strikingly , AQR in the double mutants transformed the majority of its front area into ﬁlopodia - like structures , with an average of 4 . 4 per cell , and the lengths of these ﬁnger - like structures were much longer than those in the single mutants ( Figures 4B – 4G and Movie S9 ) . These synthetic phenotypes support the hypoth - esis that WAVE plays a critical role in activating Arp2 / 3 while WASP is not essential but compensates for the loss of WAVE . SEM - 5 and MIG - 2 Synergistically Activate WASP In Vitro To further explore the contribution of WASP to cell migration , we used in vitro actin polymerization assays to study how WASP is activated by factors that are essential for cell migration . The inhibitory intramolecular interactions between the WASP regula - tory guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase ) - binding domain ( GBD ) and its activity - bearing VCA domain can be released by diverse upstream activators , facilitating the VCA domain to activate Arp2 / 3 ( Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . The C . elegans small GTPase MIG - 2 is required for Q cell migration ( Zipkin et al . , 1997 ) , and we showed that mig - 2 mu - tations enhanced AQR migration defects in sem - 5 conditional mutants ( Figure S2A ) . Given that MIG - 2 and SEM - 5 may bind to the GBD domain and the proline - rich region of WASP , respec - tively , both effectors may simultaneously bind to and coopera - tively activate WASP . To test this assumption , we used pull - down assays to show that the C . elegans WSP - 1 ( WASP ) : : GFP , which was expressed in Drosophila S2 cells , interacts with His - tagged SEM - 5 and the constitutively active form of 3 3 FLAG - tagged MIG - 2 ( CA , Q65L ) ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . We expressed the GST - tagged full - length WSP - 1 in insect Sf9 cells and puriﬁed the soluble WASP protein using afﬁnity chromatography , ion exchange , and gel - ﬁltration columns ( see Experimental Procedures ) . We also prepared the recombinant His - tagged SEM - 5 and MIG - 2CA and GST - tagged VCA domain of WSP - 1 ( Figure 5C ) . Using the in vitro pyrene - actin polymerization assay with the pure bovine Arp2 / 3 complex , we showed that SEM - 5 did not affect actin polymerization on its own but stimulated the WASP - Arp2 / 3 - activated actin polymerization in a dose - depen - dent manner ( Figure S4A ) , which is consistent with the reported activity of Grb2 in actin polymerization ( Carlier et al . , 2000 ) . MIG - 2CA also promoted the WASP - Arp2 / 3 - activated actin polymeri - zation but did not inﬂuence actin polymerization in the absence of WASP ( Figure S4B ) . Importantly , higher activation was ob - tained when SEM - 5 and MIG - 2CA were added together ( Fig - ure S4B , red line ) . These spectroﬂuorimetry results suggested that both effectors enable a synergistic activation of WASP . To further understand how these molecules stimulate actin polymerization , we used total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to quantify branching events along actin ﬁlaments . As anticipated , actin monomers alone formed long and unbranched ﬁlaments , and few branches were generated if WASP was added . The addition of SEM - 5 or MIG - 2CA individ - ually produced more F - actin branches than WASP - Arp2 / 3 alone , and the combinatory addition of SEM - 5 and MIG - 2CA further increased the number of branches ( Figures 5D and 5E ; Movie S10 ) . These results indicate that the branching activity of WASP - Arp2 / 3 is synergistically enhanced by the combination of SEM - 5 and MIG - 2 . WAVE and WASP Coordinate to Recruit Arp2 / 3 to the Leading Edge To understand the subcellular localization of WAVE and WASP , we constructed GFP : : WVE - 1 and GFP : : WSP - 1 knockin animals ( Figures 6B and 6C ) . Interestingly , WASP was detected at the leading edge , and under a 150 3 objective the GFP : : WSP - 1 signal was resolved to separate puncta , which was not previ - ously reported in migrating cells of live animals but may repre - sent its real behavior at the endogenous expression level ( Fig - ure 6C ) . GFP : : WVE - 1 and ARX - 2 : : GFP also accumulate at the leading edge : some of their signal is resolved as clusters , 230 Developmental Cell 39 , 224 – 238 , October 24 , 2016 A B E F G C D Figure 4 .

GFP : : WSP - 1 , GFP : : WVE - 1 , and ARX - 2 : : GFP occu - pied 36 % , 53 % , and 89 % , respectively , of the periphery of the leading edge ( Figures 6A – 6C ) . Furthermore , the ﬂuorescence enrichment or the distribution of ARX - 2 : : GFP at the leading edge were reduced from 2 . 1 - fold or 89 % in WT cells to 1 . 7 - fold or 79 % in wsp - 1 - deﬁcient cells , and both parameters were more severely decreased to 1 . 5 - fold or 67 % in wve - 1 con - ditional mutants ( Figures 6D – 6F ) . Thus , WASP and WAVE are both involved in the recruitment of Arp2 / 3 to the leading edge , but WAVE plays a major role . To assess how WAVE and WASP act together at the leading edge , we performed triple ﬂuorescence imaging analysis to visualize their distributions in the same migrating cell . For this experiment , we constructed a transgenic animal that ex - presses TagRFP : : WVE - 1 knockin , GFP : : WSP - 1 knockin , and the Q cell marker P lin - 32 : : TagBFP . Approximately 6 . 1 clusters of TagRFP : : WAVE per cell or 2 . 5 clusters of GFP : : WASP per cell did not overlap , and a small portion of WAVE and WASP co - clustered in the discrete microdomains at the leading edge ( 1 . 3 puncta per cell , Figures 6G and 6H ) . These observations suggest that the majority of Arp2 / 3 could be independently activated by either WAVE or WASP , while a small region of the leading edge may use both factors to active Arp2 / 3 . We further measured ﬂuorescence enrichment and distribution length of GFP : : WVE - 1 at the leading edge in wsp - 1 mutants or GFP : : WSP - 1 in wve - 1 conditional mutant animals . In wsp - 1 mu - tants , the WAVE complex did not increase its relative ﬂuores - cence intensity ( Figures 7A and 7C ) and was localized in a slightly wider region compared with WT ( from 53 % to 62 % , Figures 7A and 7D ) . In contrast , the loss of WAVE caused a 1 . 1 - fold increase of total ﬂuorescence enrichment of WASP clusters ( Figures 7B A WSP - 1 : : GFPGFP MIG - 2CA : : 3×FLAG + + + + + + IB : An - GFP IB : An FLAG Input IP : GFP - - - - + + WSP - 1 : : GFPGFP His : : SEM - 5 + + + + + + + + Coomassie Input His pull down - - - - C Lane 1 .

The upregulation of WASP may result from the global increase in WASP protein level or the recruitment of more WASP from the cytosol . Given that the conditional mutations of WAVE speciﬁcally occur in Q cells , we used the GFP : : WSP - 1 level in the neighboring hyp7 cell as an internal control to distinguish between these two pos - sibilities . We showed that the total amount of WASP was not altered ( 1 . 25 ± 0 . 03 - fold Q versus hyp7 in WT or 1 . 29 ± 0 . 03 - fold in WAVE conditional mutants , mean ± SEM , n = 10 , no sta - tistical signiﬁcance based on Student’s t test ) and that the WASP level was markedly increased in WAVE conditional mutant cells ( Figure S3F ) , implying that the loss of WAVE causes more cyto - solic WASP to be recruited to the leading edge . In sum , our data suggest that WASP could expand its functional territory to acti - vate Arp2 / 3 in the absence of WAVE , thereby partially replacing the function of WAVE to maintain fractional cell migration . DISCUSSION Our study describes two parallel pathways that mediate the signal transduction from MIG - 13 / Lrp12 to the actin cytoskeleton during directional cell migration ( Figure 7G ) . Our live imaging analysis of the actin cytoskeleton in conditional knockout animals demonstrated that the Arp2 / 3 complex is essential for actin assembly at the leading edge . We revealed that WAVE and WASP coordinate in a previously unknown semi - redundant manner that ensures robust cell migration during neural development . Coordination of WAVE and WASP in Activating Arp2 / 3 during Cell Migration Although it is widely believed that Arp2 / 3 - nucleated dendritic actin networks propel directional cell motility ( Rotty et al . , 2013 ; Swaney and Li , 2016 ) , this notion has not been rigorously examined in vivo because Arp2 / 3 is critical for cell viability ( Pollard and Cooper , 2009 ) . Our study generated the conditional knockout animals to dissect the role of Arp2 / 3 during cell migra - tion in a living animal . We showed that Arp2 / 3 plays critical roles in directional cell migration by stimulating actin assembly at the leading edge , which supports the ﬁndings from the cultured sys - tems ( Suraneni et al . , 2012 , 2015 ; Wang et al . , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 2012 ) . Considering that WASP / WAVE - Arp2 / 3 dependent actin polymerization is involved in membrane trafﬁcking , we examined the membrane localization of MIG - 13 : : GFP in WASP and WAVE single or double mutants as well as ABL - 1 and SEM - 5 single or double mutants . We did not detect any obvious alteration of MIG - 13 distribution on the plasma membrane ( Figure S1G ) . Similarly , the signaling capacity of EGF or PDGF was not reduced in Arp2 / 3 - deﬁcient cells ( Suraneni et al . , 2012 , 2015 ; Wu et al . , 2012 ) , which suggests that membrane localization of EGF and PDGF receptors may be normal in the absence of Arp2 / 3 . Hence , WASP / WAVE - Arp2 / 3 may be dispensable for membrane localization of some types of receptors including MIG - 13 , EGF , and PDGF receptors . Arp2 / 3 may function at distinct critical concentrations in different cellular events . During Q cell migration , the Arp2 / 3 level at the leading edge of WASP mutants may be above the threshold at which the residual Arp2 / 3 still supports cell motility , whereas WAVE mutations reduce Arp2 / 3 below the threshold ( Figures 4 and 6 ) . The critical concentration of Arp2 / 3 for cell viability may be lower than the amount that promotes cell motility . When the arx - 2 - sg conditional mutation was crossed into an ARX - 2 : : GFP knockin strain , the GFP ﬂuorescence was completely eliminated in 19 % of AQR ( Figure S1D , n > 50 ) , and the remaining amount of Arp2 / 3 in these cells , which is below our microscopic detection , are sufﬁcient to support cell survival . Therefore , our results are not contradictory to the compromised viability in Arp2 / 3 - null cells ; and instead , the conditional elimina - tion of Arp2 / 3 to different levels facilitate the separation of its manifold functions . The differential sensitivity of WAVE and WASP to MIG - 13 signaling may arise because WAVE appears to be more posi - tively charged than WASP , which may enable a preferential recruitment of WAVE to the plasma membrane ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . Consistently , WAVE mutations caused a marked increase of WASP at the leading edge , and the absence of WASP resulted in widespread dispersion of WAVE ( Figures 7D – 7F ) . The manner in which WAVE and WASP have distinct but partially overlapping functions is noteworthy . In WT Dictyostelium , WAVE / SCAR but not WASP assembles actin in pseudopods ; however , in WAVE knockout cells , WASP redistributes to the leading edge and as - sumes the position , behavior , and upstream regulators of WAVE ( Veltman et al . , 2012 ) . Intriguingly , WAVE promotes lamellipo - dium assembly via Arp2 / 3 for 2D migration , whereas N - WASP is implicated in 3D invasion , and the depletion of WAVE pro - motes N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 complex activation in this process ( Tang et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , WAVE and WASP not only compensate for the loss of one another but also have an inhibitory role in different types of cell migration . Figure 6 .

Two activators acting together will provide greater engagement and activation than either acting alone because they act on the same allosteric equilibrium and their individual effects are thermodynamically coupled ( Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ) . Other studies also described the cooperative activation of WASP by Cdc42 , Toca - 1 , and PIP2 or WAVE by Rac , IRSp53 , and PIP3 ( Greuber et al . , 2013 ; Ho et al . , 2004 ) . However , the physiological relevance of the synergy was not explored . Our genetic results revealed that MIG - 2 and SEM - 5 act in parallel to promote cell migration in vivo ( Figure S2A ) , high - lighting the in vivo importance of these synergetic biochemical reactions . Genetic Analysis of the MIG - 13 Signaling Pathway In our model , SEM - 5 but not WASP is essential for cell migration , whereas ABL - 1 is dispensable for cell migration but WAVE is crit - ical . The disparate phenotypes are likely due to the existence of other key but unknown factors that are involved in MIG - 13 signaling . Additional factors besides WASP may function down - stream of MIG - 13 - SEM - 5 , and ABL - 1 may not be the only linker between MIG - 13 and WAVE . Alternatively , the interplay of com - ponents in the two pathways may account for the discrepancy . This study reports that the small GTPase MIG - 2 activates WASP ( Figures 5 and S4 ) , and it is possible that MIG - 2 also ac - tivates the WAVE complex . In agreement with this notion , double mutations of MIG - 2 and MIG - 13 enhanced the cell migration phenotype compared with the single mutations ( Wang et al . , 2013 ) . The isolated Abi protein in the WAVE complex activates N - WASP through its SH3 domain ( Innocenti et al . , 2005 ) , further suggestive of potential crosstalk between the two pathways . While the isolation of SOEM - 1 facilitated the discovery of MIG - 13 downstream components , two putative null mutations of soem - 1 do not perturb Q cell migration ( Figure S2A ) . In SOEM - 1 : : GFP knockin animals , SOEM - 1 is expressed in PQR but not in AQR ( Figure S2C ) , which is consistent with its role in trans - ducing ectopic MIG - 13 signaling in PQR . Intriguingly , the ectopic expression of soem - 1 in AQR reduced the anterior migration , which indicates that the inhibition of soem - 1 expression is essential for AQR migration ( Figure S2A ) . Given that the Y2H interactions between MIG - 13 and ABL - 1 or SEM - 5 were veriﬁed using MIG - 13 : : GFP proteins that were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells but not in bacteria ( Figures 2E and 3B ) , the phosphorylation of MIG - 13C by the eukaryotic kinase ( s ) may be important in the recruitment of binding partners of MIG - 13 . In support of this view , the cytoplasmic tail of MIG - 13 is predicated to harbor consensus phosphorylation motifs for tyrosine kinases or serine / threonine kinases , and mutations of the C . elegans SRC kinase ( SRC - 1 ) and nuclear factor k B - inducing kinase MIG - 15 affect Q cell migration ( Chapman et al . , 2008 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Sym et al . , 1999 ) . Mammalian homologs of the components that connect MIG - 13 to the actin cytoskeleton are expressed in brain ( e . g . , Lrp12 , Grb2 , ABL1 , Arp2 / 3 , N - WASP , and WAVE1 ) , and Lrp12 and Arp2 / 3 have been implicated in corticogenesis ( Grote et al . , 2016 ; Schneider et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2016 ) . How they regu - late the neuronal migration in vertebrates will be an exciting topic for future work . Mechanisms underlying actin organization would provide a potent way to regulate neural stem cell migration and , ultimately , brain development .

C . elegans Strains , Genetics , and DNA Manipulations Strains were maintained on nematode growth medium plates seeded with Escherichia coli OP50 at 20 (cid:1) C following standard protocols . The primers , plasmids , PCR product , and strains used in this study are listed in Supple - mental Experimental Procedures . To make transgenic strains , we injected 1 – 30 ng / m L DNA into C . elegans germlines . Gamma - irradiation was used to integrate transgenes into chromosome . Conditional knockout and knockin strains were generated as previously described ( Dickinson et al . , 2013 ; Shen et al . , 2014 ) , and conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing and T7 endonuclease I ( T7EI ) assay , respectively . Yeast Two - Hybrid Assay The intracellular fragment of mig - 13 ( encoding amino acids 262 – 362 ) and soem - 1 were cloned into the pGBKT7 vector , and abl - 1 , sem - 5 , nck - 1 , and ced - 2 were individually cloned into the pGADT7 vector . The paired activation domain and binding domain constructs were transformed into the yeast strain AH109 ( Clontech ) , and the transformants were streaked on the interaction selection medium to score the growth .
