Mahmud , mahmuda @ berkeley . edu September 25 , 2021 Abstract SARS - CoV - 2 is spread primarily through person - to - person contacts . Quantifying population contact rates is important for understanding the impact of physical distancing policies and for modeling COVID - 19 , but contact patterns have changed substantially over time due to shifting policies and behaviors . There are surprisingly few empirical estimates of age - structured contact rates in the United States both before and throughout the COVID - 19 pandemic that capture these changes . Here , we use data from six waves of the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Survey ( BICS ) , which collected detailed contact data between March 22 , 2020 and February 15 , 2021 across six metropolitan designated market areas ( DMA ) in the United States . Contact rates were low across all six DMAs at the start of the pandemic . We ﬁnd steady increases in the mean and median number of contacts across these localities over time , as well as a greater proportion of respondents reporting a high number of contacts . We also ﬁnd that young adults between ages 18 and 34 reported more contacts on average compared to other age groups . The 65 and older age group consistently reported low levels of contact throughout the study period . To understand the impact of these changing contact patterns , we simulate COVID - 19 dynamics in each DMA using an age - structured mechanistic model . We compare results from models that use BICS contact rate estimates versus commonly used alternative contact rate sources . We ﬁnd that simulations parameterized with BICS estimates give insight into time - varying changes in relative incidence by age group that are not captured in the absence of these frequently updated estimates . We also ﬁnd that simulation results based on BICS estimates closely match observed data on the age distribution of cases , and changes in these distributions over time . Together these ﬁndings highlight the role of diﬀerent age groups in driving and sustaining SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the U . S . We also show the utility of repeated contact surveys in revealing heterogeneities in the epidemiology of COVID - 19 across localities in the United States . Keywords : COVID - 19 ; contact rates ; mathematical modeling ; age - structured model Introduction 1 SARS - CoV - 2 , the causative agent for COVID - 19 , is transmitted primarily through close person - to - person interactions 2 ( Cevik , Kuppalli , Kindrachuk , & Peiris , 2020 ) . The transmission dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 , and subsequent mor - 3 bidity and mortality from COVID - 19 , are therefore fundamentally dependent on changing patterns of interpersonal 4 1 .

The multiple waves that have characterized the epidemic so far in the USA have been 5 caused by shifting contact rates , as populations have responded to the pandemic with various physical distancing 6 policies . Quantifying population contact patterns and changes in these patterns over time is especially important for 7 identifying demographic groups that are driving and sustaining disease transmission in a population . 8 Age - speciﬁc contact patterns are especially relevant for COVID - 19 because clinical outcomes , and likely suscep - 9 tibility to infection , vary by age ( Davies et al . , 2020 ) . While the age structure of COVID - 19 infections has changed 10 over time , with more cases reported among younger age groups during the summer of 2020 compared to the initial 11 wave ( Boehmer , 2020 ) , evidence is limited regarding the relative importance of changing testing rates versus changing 12 contact patterns in driving this ﬁnding . Further , the extent to which diﬀerent demographic groups shifted in driving 13 and sustaining transmission over time remains unclear ( Monod et al . , 2021 ) . 14 The unprecedented adoption of physical distancing policies during the COVID - 19 pandemic has , meanwhile , 15 created dynamic contact rates and patterns that are challenging to capture in the absence of frequently collected 16 data . Interpersonal contact rates declined signiﬁcantly after lockdown and shelter - in - place mandates were announced 17 in US cities in mid - March , and slowly increased over the summer after restrictions began to ease by late April ( Feehan 18 & Mahmud , 2021 ) . There is , however , considerable heterogeneity across the US in terms of both the infection and 19 mortality burden of COVID - 19 , as well as the types of non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPI ) adopted . As such , 20 quantifying the variation in contact rates between cities over time is key to understanding spatial and temporal 21 variations in contact patterns and infection burden by age and demographics , as well as the eﬀectiveness of physical 22 distancing policies in diﬀerent localities over time . 23 Surveys have been used previously to quantify population contact rates to understand transmission dynamics 24 of respiratory pathogens ( Rohani , Zhong , & King , 2010 ; Kucharski et al . , 2014 ; Eames , Tilston , Brooks - Pollock , & 25 Edmunds , 2012 ; Melegaro , Jit , Gay , Zagheni , & Edmunds , 2011 ) . In the absence of existing surveys for the US , 26 many age - structured mathematical models of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the US rely on pre - pandemic estimates 27 of contact patterns ( Hay , Haw , Hanage , Metcalf , & Mina , 2020 ; Miller , Becker , Grenfell , & Metcalf , 2020 ; Enns 28 et al . , 2020 ) , based on the POLYMOD study in Europe ( Mossong et al . , 2008 ) , or on synthetic ( modeled ) contact 29 rates ( Davies et al . , 2020 ; Bubar et al . , 2021 ; Prem et al . , 2020 ; Larremore et al . , 2021 ) based on POLYMOD and 30 country - speciﬁc socio - demographic data ( Prem , Cook , & Jit , 2017 ; Prem et al . , 2021 ) . While there has been an 31 increase in contact surveys conducted globally since the landmark POLYMOD study ( Hoang et al . , 2019 ) , there have 32 been few studies conducted in the US that allow for estimation of age - speciﬁc contact patterns ( Zagheni et al . , 2008 ; 33 A . Dorelien , Ramen , & Swanson , 2020 ) , and there have been no studies to date in the US covering more than one 34 locality ( A . M . Dorelien et al . , 2020 ) over the course of the COVID - 19 pandemic . In general , there is a deﬁcit in 35 contact survey studies conducted in the US both before the pandemic and especially during its course . 36 To this end , the ongoing Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Survey ( BICS ) has been collecting detailed contact data 37 in the US over the course of the COVID - 19 pandemic . The BICS consists of six survey waves that have collected 38 information on respondents’ total number of contacts , demographic information about their contacts , and the nature 39 of these contacts ( e . g . location , duration ) . Existing work has used BICS data to quantify changes in contact rates 40 over time and to assess the eﬀectiveness of social distancing measures nationally ( Feehan & Mahmud , 2021 ) . Here , 41 we focus on the BICS quota samples collected from six US designated market areas ( DMA ) surrounding Atlanta , 42 the San Francisco Bay Area , Boston , New York City , Philadelphia , and Phoenix . We ﬁrst quantify overall contact 43 patterns across the six DMAs over time to understand the impact of NPIs on interpersonal contact . We then use these 44 data to parameterize an age - structured mechanistic model of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission to understand changes in 45 age - speciﬁc infection burden over time . We show that the median number of reported contacts was fairly stable over 46 time across DMAs , but that the mean number of reported contacts generally increased over time . Moreover , across 47 DMAs , 18 - 34 year olds reported the highest mean number of contacts compared to other age groups in most survey 48 waves . Our simulation results from a mathematical model parameterized with empirical contact rates from the BICS 49 study closely match observed data on the proportion of COVID - 19 cases by age group ; in contrast , simulation results 50 from a model parameterized with alternative contact rate estimates commonly used in the literature are unable to 51 2 .

This approach provides a way to improve model estimates 52 during outbreaks , which will be critical for responding to COVID - 19 and future outbreaks . 53 Results 54 We use data from six waves of the BICS study collected between March 22 and April 8 , 2020 ( Wave 0 ) ; between April 55 10 and May 4 , 2020 ( Wave 1 ) ; between June 17 and 23 , 2020 ( Wave 2 ) ; between September 11 and 26 , 2020 ( Wave 56 3 ) ; between November 29 and December 16 , 2020 ( Wave 4 ) ; and between February 7 and February 15 , 2021 ( Wave 57 5 ) . We quantiﬁed the mean and median number of contacts in each BICS survey wave across the six DMAs ( Figure 58 1A ) . Despite the diﬀerences in COVID - 19 epidemic trajectories and NPIs enforced across the diﬀerent DMAs , all 59 localities show similar dynamics in the mean and median number of reported contacts over time . Although median 60 values across DMAs were fairly stable across survey waves , the means varied substantially because the distribution of 61 the number of contacts was highly right - skewed across all locations , with the mean number of contacts exceeding the 62 median for most survey waves . These diﬀerences were driven by changes in contact rates among those reporting large 63 numbers of contacts per day ( Figure 1B ) . In the ﬁrst wave , the vast majority of respondents reported having ﬁve or 64 fewer contacts per day , but the mean generally increased across survey waves and peaked in Wave 3 ( September 11 - 26 , 65 2020 ) for Atlanta , the Bay Area , New York City , and Philadelphia . Respondents in Atlanta reported the highest 66 mean number of contacts during the BICS study at 7 . 4 contacts in Wave 3 . The mean number of contacts in Boston 67 increased relatively steadily to a value of 6 . 1 by Wave 5 ( February 7 - 15 , 2021 ) . Phoenix respondents , meanwhile , 68 reported a peak in Wave 4 at 6 . 2 mean contacts ( November 29 - December 16 , 2020 ) . While the median number of 69 reported contacts remained relatively stable , the distribution of the number of contacts changed across survey waves , 70 with a larger proportion of respondents reporting more than ﬁve contacts over time . 71 Figure 1 : Descriptive analyses of the number of contacts estimated for the 6 DMAs across BICS Waves 0 - 5 .

The cutoﬀ of seven contacts represents the 80th 73 percentile in the BICS data across survey waves and DMAs . We ﬁnd that compared to the reference group of 18 - 24 74 year olds , 25 - 34 and 35 - 44 year olds had a higher odds of reporting more than seven contacts , while 65 + year olds 75 were least likely to report more than seven contacts . Atlanta residents had a higher odds of reporting more than 76 seven contacts compared to the other DMAs in the BICS study . Black and other non - Hispanics had a lower odds 77 of reporting more than seven contacts relative to White non - Hispanics and Hispanics . Consistent with trends in the 78 mean number of contacts , the odds of respondents reporting more than seven contacts increased from Wave 0 to 79 Wave 3 and 4 before slightly declining . Males had a higher odds relative to females of reporting more than seven 80 contacts ; and the odds of reporting more than seven contacts was higher on a weekday compared to the weekend . 81 Figure 2 : The mean number of contacts reported by BICS participants aged 18 - 34 , 35 - 64 , and 65 + years old during survey Waves 0 - 5 in each DMA of the BICS study . To understand the demographic groups driving and sustaining transmission , we analyzed the mean number of 82 reported contacts by respondent age groups . Across DMAs , 18 - 34 year olds consistently reported the highest mean 83 number of contacts ( Figure 2 ) . In particular , the mean number of contacts reported by 18 - 34 year olds in the Bay 84 Area increased from 3 . 2 mean contacts in Wave 0 to a peak of 9 . 0 mean contacts in Wave 3 before declining . The 85 middle age group of 35 - 64 year olds in general exhibited a steady increase in the mean number of contacts over 86 time across DMAs . In Phoenix and Atlanta , 35 - 64 year olds had the highest mean number of contacts in Waves 4 87 and 5 . Lastly , 65 + year olds consistently reported the lowest mean number of contacts relative to other age groups 88 across time and DMAs . Supplementary Figure S3 shows the corresponding ﬁgure with the mean number of reported 89 contacts for ﬁve age groups . 90 Importantly , transmission dynamics depend not only on the mean number of contacts reported by age group , but 91 also on which age groups interact with one another due to age - speciﬁc diﬀerences in susceptibility to infection and 92 likelihood of presenting with symptomatic disease . The age - structured contact matrices estimated for all reported 93 contacts and reported non - household contacts in each survey wave and DMA are shown in Supplementary Figures 94 S4 and S5 . The age - structured matrices are similar across DMAs , with consistent evidence of assortative mixing and 95 a higher mean number of contacts reported by 25 - 34 and 35 - 44 year olds starting in Wave 3 . 96 To understand the impact of changing contact rates and patterns on disease burden , we simulated SARS - CoV - 97 4 .

We present the model results in terms of four age groups for visual simplicity given the similarity 99 in patterns between certain age groups , but the results for all six age groups are presented in Supplementary Figures 100 S6 and S7 . We present simulation results in terms of the reference group of 0 - 17 year olds , and also compare with 101 observed data where possible . 102 We ﬁnd that 18 - 34 year olds and 35 - 64 year olds had a higher total incidence ( including both clinical and 103 subclinical cases ) of COVID - 19 relative to the reference group of 0 - 17 year olds across DMAs and time ( Figure 3A ) . 104 Despite their much higher susceptibility to infection , the oldest age group of 65 + year olds had comparable or lower 105 total incidence relative to 0 - 17 year olds in the simulation results , particularly in later waves , as a result of 65 + year 106 olds’ substantially lower contact rates . When we look at clinical incidence , as expected , we ﬁnd that all age groups 107 have higher clinical incidence relative to the reference group of 0 - 17 year olds across survey waves due to the model’s 108 incorporation of age - dependent propensity to have clinical symptoms ( Supplementary Figure S8 ) . 109 Where possible based on data availability , we compare the proportion of simulated cases by age group using 110 clinical incidence results and the proportion of observed COVID - 19 cases by age group . We ﬁnd a very high correlation 111 between the simulated and observed proportions of COVID - 19 cases by age group for both New York City and Phoenix 112 ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . Our simulations are also consistent with the changing proportion of clinical cases observed in 113 5 .

For instance , we are able to simulate the observed decline in the proportion of cases in the 65 + age 114 group in New York and Phoenix after the ﬁrst wave of the outbreak in March to May 2020 ( Supplementary Figure 115 S9 ) . This suggests that this observed trend was not simply the result of changes in testing rates by age group , but 116 rather a result of the very low contact rates in the 65 and older age group compared to younger age groups . In the 117 Bay Area , our simulations captured the relatively high proportion of cases among 25 - 45 year olds , again reﬂecting 118 the age group’s relatively higher contact rates . 119 The changes in the incidence rate ratio across survey waves and DMAs that are evident in Figure 3 contrast with 120 the time - and DMA - invariant estimates from the simulation results when the model is parameterized with alternative 121 contact rate estimates commonly used in the literature ( Supplementary Figure S10 ) . Although these alternative 122 contact matrices are scaled at each wave to change the intensity of contacts based on information from the BICS 123 survey , the age - structured contact patterns are invariant over time , highlighting the need for frequent up - to - date 124 empirical estimates . As a result , the estimated IRRs for diﬀerent age groups relative to the youngest age group of 125 0 - 17 year olds are stable over time , and diﬀerences between DMAs are driven by diﬀerences in their demography 126 rather than changes in the contact patterns . 127 Discussion 128 The ongoing COVID - 19 pandemic and physical distancing policies have fundamentally altered interpersonal interac - 129 tions across the US and globally . Yet , little is known about how contact rates and patterns have changed and the 130 implications for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission dynamics . We studied contact rate patterns across six DMAs in the US 131 over the course of the COVID - 19 pandemic , and modeled the impact of changing contact patterns on incidence across 132 diﬀerent age groups . We ﬁnd that the median and mean number of contacts reported across survey waves steadily 133 increased from March 2020 to September 2020 before declining slightly . Mean contact rate diﬀerences were driven by 134 shifting distributions of rates , with some individuals reporting many contacts per day . We ﬁnd consistent diﬀerences 135 across age groups ; 18 - 34 year olds reported among the highest mean number of contacts across survey waves in all 136 DMAs , while 65 + year olds reported the lowest . The similarity in contact patterns across DMAs is surprising given 137 their heterogeneity in the timing and reinforcement of diﬀerent physical distancing policies , although this may reﬂect 138 the fact that the six DMAs included in the BICS study are all large , urban metropolitan areas . 139 Our simulation results suggest time - and DMA - varying diﬀerences in the relative incidence of COVID - 19 infections 140 by age groups . Despite 65 + year olds having a higher susceptibility to infection relative to other age groups , they 141 had comparable or lower incidence rates of COVID - 19 in our simulations relative to younger age groups due to their 142 substantially lower mean daily contact rates . In contrast to the results from the model parameterized with empirical 143 contact rate estimates from BICS , the simulation results using synthetic contact data fail to capture shifts in the 144 proportion of COVID - 19 cases by age group . This diﬀerence reinforces the value of collecting empirical contact rate 145 estimates in order to capture spatial and temporal changes in contact rates and patterns . 146 This analysis has several limitations to consider . First , BICS uses a quota sample from an online panel instead of 147 a probability sample . However , respondent - level calibration weights were estimated to adjust for sample composition 148 to produce representative surveys for each DMA . Moreover , information bias is a concern for contact surveys due to 149 diﬃculties with recall and social desirability bias , which may be expected to be especially pronounced in the middle 150 of a pandemic . Respondents may therefore have under - reported their number of contacts in the survey . At the same 151 time , the BICS survey captures only two - way conversational and physical contacts . Other types of contacts that 152 might be relevant to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , including , for example , contacts that happen from being in close 153 proximity to others , were not captured in this analysis . The analyses also did not take into account the nature of these 154 conversational and physical contacts , such as mask wearing , distance maintained during the contact , and duration of 155 the contact . In terms of generalizability , the BICS is only oﬀered in English , limiting the ability to generalize results 156 to Americans whose primary language is not English . Lastly , since children , deﬁned as less than age 18 , are not 157 included in the BICS , previously developed methods were used to ﬁll missing data values for the youngest age group . 158 6 .

Our method for estimating the 160 reproduction number ( Wallinga & Teunis , 2004 ) assumes that all cases in our dataset acquired infections from others 161 in the dataset , and it thereby excludes unreported cases and asymptomatic individuals ; this may bias the estimate 162 if the proportion of unreported cases changed over time . Lastly , comparisons between the proportion of simulated 163 cases by age group and the proportion of observed COVID - 19 cases are diﬃcult to make due to diﬀerences in age 164 categorization of the observed data , as well as temporal changes in testing rates by age , which are not captured in 165 our model . We therefore only presented these comparisons for New York City and Phoenix . 166 Contact rate estimates from the BICS study oﬀer unique insight into how age - structured contact patterns have 167 changed across time and localities in the US during the COVID - 19 pandemic . Since the BICS study is an ongoing 168 eﬀort , data from additional survey waves will continue to provide invaluable information on how contact rate patterns 169 continue to change as the COVID - 19 pandemic evolves . Examining whether and when contact rates return to pre - 170 pandemic levels , and understanding the relationship between contact rates and NPIs for SARS - CoV - 2 and other 171 respiratory pathogens , are key directions for future research . 172 Materials and Methods 173 Survey Population 174 The BICS data collection occurred in six waves : between March 22 and April 8 , 2020 ( Wave 0 ) ; between April 10 175 and May 4 , 2020 ( Wave 1 ) ; between June 17 and 23 , 2020 ( Wave 2 ) ; between September 11 and 26 , 2020 ( Wave 176 3 ) ; between November 29 and December 16 , 2020 ( Wave 4 ) ; and between February 7 and February 15 , 2021 ( Wave 177 5 ) . A total of 15 , 712 respondents were surveyed in the US ( Wave 0 n = 1 , 437 ; Wave 1 n = 2 , 627 ; Wave 2 n = 2 , 431 ; 178 Wave 3 n = 3 , 248 ; Wave 4 n = 2 , 993 ; Wave 5 n = 2 , 976 ) ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . Respondents were recruited using 179 Lucid , an online panel provider . Two samples were obtained in each survey wave : 1 ) a quota sample intended to 180 be representative of the US ( national sample ) ; and 2 ) smaller quota samples from the DMAs of New York City , the 181 San Francisco Bay Area , Atlanta , Phoenix , Boston , and Philadelphia ( city - level samples ) . Philadelphia was added in 182 Wave 1 . 183 The survey methodology is described in more detail in Feehan and Mahmud ( 2021 ) ( Feehan & Mahmud , 2021 ) . 184 In brief , respondents were asked to report the number of people with whom they had contact on the day before the 185 survey interview . Contacts were deﬁned as a two - way conversation with three or more words in the physical presence 186 of another person . Starting in Wave 1 , the survey also asked about physical contacts . Demographic information was 187 collected on respondents ( e . g . age , gender , race / ethnicity , household size , educational status ) . Respondents were 188 asked to provide detailed information on up to three of their reported contacts , including demographic information of 189 their contacts , as well as the duration and location of the contact . In Wave 0 , respondents reported all contacts , and 190 then reported how many of their contacts were non - household members . Beginning in Wave 1 , respondents provided 191 a household roster and then reported their non - household contacts . 192 All survey respondents provided informed consent and the project was approved by the UC Berkeley IRB ( Protocol 193 2020 - 03 - 13128 ) . 194 Survey Weights 195 Supplementary Table S2 presents the unweighted survey population’s demographics . Since some respondents were 196 oversampled in select cities , weights were used to account for sample composition , as previously described ( Feehan 197 & Mahmud , 2021 ) . Respondent - level weights were estimated to represent the number of people that respondent i 198 represents in their city’s general population . These weights were designed based on a model - based inference approach , 199 in which pseudo - probabilities of inclusion are calculated , and then calibrated based on age categories , sex , age 200 by sex interactions , educations , race , Hispanicity , household size category , and whether the respondent lives in a 201 7 .

We performed the calibration using the R packages autumn and leafpeepr ( Rossell , 202 n . d . ; Aaron , n . d . ) . Characteristics of survey respondents in the unweighted vs . weighted samples are shown in 203 Supplementary Figure S1 . Contact - level weights were estimated since detailed information on reported contacts was 204 only collected for a subset of a respondent’s total number of contacts ( up to three contacts ) . 205 Construction of Contact Matrices 206 The methods for estimating age - structured contact matrices for each wave and DMA of the BICS study have been 207 previously described ( Feehan & Mahmud , 2021 ) , and are summarized here . Respondents were grouped into six age 208 categories : 0 - 17 , 18 - 24 , 25 - 34 , 35 - 44 , 45 - 64 , and 65 + . The raw contact matrix M has entries m ij , representing the 209 average number of daily contacts between respondents in age group , i , with their reported contacts in age group , j . 210 We adjusted for survey weights , such that m ij was calculated as : 211 m ij = T i (cid:80) t = 1 w t , i y t , j T i (cid:80) t = 1 w t , i ( 1 ) where w t , i is the weight for reports made by participant t , in age group i , and y t , j is the number of reported contacts 212 made by respondent t in age group j . T i is the total number of respondents in age group i . 213 We next created a reciprocal contact matrix C , such that on the population level the total number of contacts that 214 respondents in age group i report with individuals in age group j is equal to the number of contacts that respondents 215 in age group j report with individuals in age group i : 216 c ij = m ij N i + m ji N j 2 N i ( 2 ) where c ij are the entries of the reciprocal contact matrix , C , and N i and N j the population size in age class i and j , 217 respectively . 218 Since children , deﬁned as < 18 years old , were excluded from the BICS study , using methods previously developed 219 and used ( Klepac et al . , 2020 ; Jarvis et al . , 2020 ) , we imputed the within age group average number of contacts for 220 the youngest age group . Brieﬂy , for each wave and DMA of the BICS study , we calculated the ratio of the dominant 221 eigenvalue of the contact matrix estimated from the BICS data to the dominant eigenvalue of the contact matrix 222 estimated for the US from Prem et al . ( 2021 ) ( Prem et al . , 2021 ) , with school contacts removed to reﬂect school 223 closure policies in 2020 . The matrices for this calculation were subset to exclude age groups with missing values . We 224 then multiplied the within age group average number of contacts for the youngest age group from Prem et al . ( 2021 ) 225 by this ratio . 226 Logistic Regression 227 We examined factors associated with the probability of reporting > 7 contacts , where seven represents the 80th 228 percentile in the BICS data across all waves and DMAs . We ﬁt a logistic regression model using maximum likelihood : 229 logit ( µ i ) = α + X Ti β ( 3 ) where µ i is the probability of respondent i reporting > 7 contacts , X i is a vector of covariates , including age group , 230 DMA , gender , race / ethnicity ( Non - Hispanic White , Non - Hispanic Black / Hispanic / Non - Hispanic Other ) , survey wave , 231 and whether the survey day was a weekday , and β is a vector of the estimated coeﬃcients . 232 8 .

The SEIR model has two infectious compartments – clinical and subclinical . Consistent with the deﬁnitions used 236 in Davies et al . ( 2020 ) ( Davies et al . , 2020 ) , we deﬁned clinical , infectious individuals as symptomatic individuals , 237 while subclinical , infectious individuals include both pauci - symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals who are likely 238 to remain undetected by surveillance . For all compartments the index i references the age category ( 0 - 17 , 18 - 24 , 239 25 - 34 , 35 - 44 , 45 - 64 , and 65 + ) . Individuals in the susceptible compartment , S i , transition to the exposed ( but not yet 240 infectious ) compartment , E i , through contact with a clinical or subclinical infectious individual at rate λ i ( t ) , which 241 is a time - varying , age - group - speciﬁc force of infection . Individuals then transition to either the clinical or subclinical 242 infectious compartment ( I Ci , I Sci ) at rate σ , which is the inverse of the mean latent period . Individuals in the infectious 243 compartments recover at rate γ , which is the inverse of the mean infectious period . Two assumptions incorporated in 244 the model are that subclinical infectious individuals are less infectious than clinical infectious individuals ( represented 245 by the reduction factor α ) , and that the probability of being a clinical vs . subclinical infectious individual is dependent 246 only on age . This model structure is in line with compartmental models frequently used in existing COVID - 19 research 247 ( Davies et al . , 2020 ; Miller et al . , 2020 ; Prem et al . , 2020 ) . Parameters values used in the model are described in 248 Supplementary Table S3 . 249 Figure 4 : Age - structured SEIR model structure and corresponding equations representing susceptible ( S i ) , exposed but not yet infectious , ( E i ) , clinical infectious ( I C i ) , subclinical infectious ( I Sc i ) , and recovered individuals ( R i ) . Age groups [ 0 , 18 ) , [ 18 , 25 ) , [ 25 , 35 ) , [ 35 , 45 ) , [ 45 , 65 ) , [ 65 , 100 ] are denoted by the index i , u i is the age - dependent probability of infection given contact with an infectious individual , C ij , t is the time - varying number of individuals in age group j contacted by an individual in age group i per day at time t , α is the multiplicative factor by which the probability of infection is reduced for subclinical infections , δ i is the age - dependent probability of being clinically infectious , σ is the inverse of the latent period , and γ is the recovery rate . Simulation Conditions 250 Simulations start two weeks prior to the ﬁrst reported case in each DMA and run to the last date of the Wave 5 251 BICS survey , February 15 , 2021 . This assumption for the starting date , which attempts to account for delays in the 252 reporting of the initial cases of COVID - 19 in the US , results in a starting date across the six DMAs that ranges from 253 the start of February to mid - February . This date range is consistent with estimated introduction times for SARS - 254 9 .

( which was not certified by peer review ) preprint The copyright holder for this this version posted September 27 , 2021 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2021 . 09 . 25 . 21264082 doi : medRxiv preprint CoV - 2 in the U . S . ( Jorden et al . , 2020 ) . To initialize the outbreaks , each DMA starts with the same proportion 255 of the population ( p 0 = 0 . 0001 ) exposed or infected , which is evenly spread across age groups in the exposed ( E i ) , 256 clinical infectious ( I Ci ) , and subclinical infectious ( I Sci ) compartments . The number of susceptible people in each 257 age group at the start of the simulation , ( S i ) , is therefore the number of people in age group in the city based 258 on ACS demographic data , minus the number of people starting in the exposed , clinical infectious , and subclinical 259 infectious compartments . All population values are from the 1 - year extract of the 2018 American Community Survey 260 provided by IPUMS ( Ruggles et al . , 2021 ) . Our model results are robust to starting simulations with diﬀerent initial 261 proportions exposed or infected , as shown in sensitivity analyses ( Supplementary Figure S11 ) . 262 The age - structured contact matrices for each DMA and wave from BICS were used as the time - varying contact 263 matrices in the SEIR models . Contact matrices from each BICS wave were used during the period in which the 264 survey wave was conducted . We linearly interpolated average reported contacts for each cell of the contact matrices 265 between survey waves to obtain the daily contact matrices C ij , t . Since the Philadelphia DMA was added in Wave 266 1 , we used the Wave 0 national age - structured contact matrix as Wave 0 for contact rates in Philadelphia ( Feehan 267 & Mahmud , 2021 ) . The BICS Wave 0 captures contact rates starting mid - March , when social distancing mandates 268 were already enforced . To capture pre - pandemic baseline contact rates we used the model - based synthetic contact 269 matrix estimated by Prem et al . ( 2021 ) for the US ( Prem et al . , 2021 ) . Since the synthetic contact matrix from Prem 270 et al . ( 2021 ) is available in 5 - year age bands , to align the youngest age group , we assumed that the 15 - 17 year olds 271 in the Prem et al . ( 2021 ) study have the same contact rates on average as 0 - 14 year olds . 272 To examine simulation results in the absence of empirical estimates from BICS , we also ran simulations that were parameterized using the same simulation conditions with one exception : the contact matrices were synthetic age - structured contact rates for the US from the literature ( Prem et al . , 2021 ) . For each BICS wave , we calculated the ratio of the dominant eigenvalue of the DMA - speciﬁc BICS contact matrix and the dominant eigenvalue of the Prem et al . ( 2021 ) US matrix , representing pre - pandemic contact rates . The estimated ratio from this calculation represents a factor by which to scale the pre - pandemic contact rate estimates to capture changing contact rates over the course of the pandemic . We multiplied the synthetic US contact matrix from Prem et al . ( 2021 ) by these scaling factors to obtain the contact rates , C sij , w in these simulations : C sij , w = ρ B w , d ρ R ∗ R ij ( 4 ) where ρ B w , d is the dominant eigenvalue of the DMA - speciﬁc ( d ) and wave - speciﬁc ( w ) BICS contact matrix , ρ R is 273 the dominant eigenvalue of the Prem et al . ( 2021 ) US contact matrix , and R ij is the US contact matrix from Prem 274 et al . ( 2021 ) . We interpolated between survey waves to obtain daily contact matrices C sij , t . 275 Calibration to Target R 0 Estimates 276 The age - dependent probabilities of infection given contact with an infectious individual , u i , were scaled by calibrating 277 to target R 0 estimates . First , we estimated the daily eﬀective reproductive number , R t , for each DMA using the 278 method developed by Wallinga and Teunis ( 2004 ) ( Wallinga & Teunis , 2004 ) , which is a likelihood - based method 279 that considers pairs of cases and uses the distribution of the serial interval ( i . e . the time interval between successive 280 cases in a transmission chain ) and a time series of incident cases . We assumed a serial interval with mean 3 . 96 days 281 and standard deviation of 4 . 75 days ( Du et al . , 2020 ) . We also used an alternate method ( Cori , Ferguson , Fraser , & 282 Cauchemez , 2013 ) for estimating R t as a sensitivity analysis , although the two estimation methods are expected to 283 yield similar results for our purposes of estimating only early R t values in a retrospective manner ( Gostic et al . , 2020 ) . 284 Our target estimates of R 0 for each DMA are the maximum mean value estimated from the Wallinga and Teunis 285 ( 2004 ) and Cori et . al . ( 2013 ) methods in the ﬁrst week of estimates . Lastly , we multiplied the next - generation 286 matrix ( NGM ) by a constant to achieve the target dominant eigenvalue , which is R 0 . Using methods previously 287 described to derive an expression for the NGM ( Diekmann , Heesterbeek , & Roberts , 2010 ) , we deﬁned the NGM as 288 the following : 289 10 .

( 2021 ) 291 US contact matrix , representing estimates of pre - pandemic contact rates , δ i is the age - dependent probability of being 292 clinically infectious , and α is the multiplicative factor by which the probability infection is reduced for subclinical 293 infections . 294 Parameter Uncertainty 295 To incorporate parameter uncertainty , we drew 1 , 000 values of R 0 for each DMA from a truncated normal distribution , 296 with the mean estimated from the R 0 estimation procedures ( Atlanta = 2 . 4 ; Bay Area = 2 . 1 ; Boston = 2 . 9 ; New 297 York City = 3 . 2 , Philadelphia = 2 . 4 ; Phoenix = 2 . 8 ) , a standard deviation of 0 . 54 , and a minimum possible value of 298 0 . 8 . In a sensitivity analysis , we also varied the proportion of the population assumed to be latent or infectious at 299 the start of the outbreak ( p 0 ) from 1 / 5 to 5 times p 0 = 0 . 0001 ( Supplementary Figure S11 ) . 300 Presentation of Results 301 In presenting our results , we calculated the incidence rate ratio ( IRR ) of infections for each BICS survey wave and 302 DMA as the following : 303 IRR i , w , d = Incidence i , w , d / N i , d Incidence [ 0 , 18 ) , w , d / N [ 0 , 18 ) , d ( 6 ) where i references the age categories 18 - 34 , 35 - 64 , and 65 + , w references the BICS survey wave , d references one of 304 the six DMAs , Incidence refers to the simulated incidence on the midpoint date of each BICS survey wave , and N 305 refers to the population size of the age group based on ACS data . IRR estimates shown in Figure 3A are based on 306 simulated total incidence while estimates in Supplementary Figure S8 are based on simulated clinical incidence . We 307 used [ 0 , 18 ) year olds as the reference age group . We collapsed the simulation results into four age categories for visual 308 simplicity due to similar ﬁndings in certain age groups , but we show the simulations results for all six age categories 309 in Supplementary Figures S6 and S7 . 310 For New York City and Phoenix , we also compared the simulated proportion of clinical infections in each age 311 group to the empirical proportion of COVID - 19 infections in each age group . The New York City data are weekly data 312 from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene ( Coronavirus Data , 2021 ) on the proportions of 313 positive COVID - 19 molecular tests by age group . The data for Phoenix are weekly conﬁrmed and probable COVID - 19 314 cases by age group reported by the Maricopa County Public Health Department ( Dashboard : Weekly conﬁrmed and 315 probably COVID - 19 cases over time by age group , 2021 ) . Since the youngest age group reported by the Maricopa 316 County Public Health Department data source is [ 0 , 19 ) , we treated this age category as [ 0 , 18 ) in order to align this 317 youngest group with our simulation results for plotting purposes . Comparing age - speciﬁc simulated and empirical 318 COVID - 19 proportions was not possible for the other DMAs due to the lack of empirical data on age categories that 319 are comparable to those in our simulations . 320 All analyses are conducted in R version 3 . 6 . 3 . 321 Author Contributions 322 Taylor Chin , Conceptualization , Methodology , Data Curation , Formal Analysis , Writing - Original Draft Preparation , 323 Writing - Review & Editing ; Dennis Feehan , Methodology , Data Curation , Writing - Review & Editing , Funding Ac - 324 quisition ; Caroline O .
