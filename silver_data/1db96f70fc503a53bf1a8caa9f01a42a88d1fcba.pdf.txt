Nature © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 1997 letters to nature NATURE | VOL 389 | 11 SEPTEMBER 1997 211 summarizedinTable1 , alldataforuntiltedspecimens , 15of20for20deg , 19of 45 for 45deg and only 18 of 62 for 60deg are of high quality . Others were less good but reasonable , with temperature factors in the direction vertical to their tilt axes in the range between55 and 180A˚ - 2 . As a result , the data quality in the direction normal to the tilt axis was poorer at resolutions beyond 4 . 0A˚ , especially in that taken around the 60deg tilt angle . These phases improved by solvent ﬂattening using the program DM 22 with the molecular envelope determined from the 5 - A˚ resolution initial map , which was obtained accordingly 5 . The calculated phases were combined with the experimental phases . The ﬁgures - of - merit ( f . o . m . ) calculated from the signal - to - noise ratio of the Fouriercomponents in the image processing 5 , 6 were close to 1 . 0 and thus too strongly inﬂuenced the combination between observed and calculated phasesinDM . Afterseveraltrialsinweightingaccordingtoresolutionsortothe location in reciprocal space , a simple multiplication of all the f . o . m . by 0 . 8 produced good weightings schema for the phase combination . Further improvement of the signal - to - noise ratio in the map was achieved byaveraging the solvent - ﬂattened density and the density calculated from ideal polyalanine (cid:97) - helices placed to ﬁt in the density . The Ramachandran plot calculated with PROCHECKfromtheresultingmodelcontains81 % oftheresiduesinthemost favourable region ; no residues arein the disallowed region of the plot . A simple preliminary positional reﬁnement ( ﬁxed B - factors ) of the current model by XPLOR produced R - factorof 24 % and free R - factorof 37 % starting with initial value of 44 % . Only the original F o map calculated with recombined phases and averaged density and the model at the early stage were presented . Received 21 October 1996 ; accepted 2 June 1997 1 .

Coﬁlin promotes rapid actin ﬁlament turnover in vivo Pekka Lappalainen & David G .

The ability of actin ﬁlaments to function in cell morphogenesis and motility is coupled to their capacity for rapid assembly and disassembly . Because disassembly in vitro is much slower than in vivo , cellular factors that stimulate disassembly have long been assumed to exist . Although numerous proteins can affect actin dynamics in vitro , demonstration of in vivo relevance of these effects has not been achieved . We have used genetics and an actin - inhibitor in yeast to demonstrate that rapid cycles of actin assembly and disassembly depend on the small actin - binding protein coﬁlin , and that coﬁlin stimulates ﬁlament disassembly . These results may explain why coﬁlin is ubiquitous in eukaryotes and is essential for viability in every organism in which its function has been tested genetically . Magnitudes of disassembly defects in coﬁlin mutants in vivo were found to be correlated closely with the magnitudes of disassembly defects observed in vitro , supporting our conclusions . Furthermore , these coﬁlin Figure 1 Cells were grown at 20 (cid:56) C to A 600 ¼ 0 : 3 , shifted to 34 (cid:56) C for 3h and ﬁxed with 5 % formaldehyde . The actin and coﬁlin in wild - type ( a , b ) , cof1 – 5 ( c , d ) and cof1 – 22 ( e , f ) were visualized by immunoﬂuorescence . In the wild - type cells , the actin patches are well polarized and actin cables are visible in the cells that are displaying polarized growth . Coﬁlin localizes to cortical actin patches . In cof1 – 5 and cof1 – 22 cells shifted to 34 (cid:56) C the actin patches are very large , irregularly shaped and almost completely depolarized . In both mutants , coﬁlin localizes mostly to these actin structures . Scale bar , 5 (cid:109) m . Nature © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 1997 letters to nature NATURE | VOL 388 | 3 JULY 1997 79 mutants provided an opportunity to distinguish in living cells those actin functions that depend speciﬁcally on ﬁlament turn - over ( endocytosis ) from those that do not ( cortical actin patch motility ) . Coﬁlin is a member of the coﬁlin / ADF family of small ( M r 15K – 20K ) actin - binding proteins 1 . These proteins bind to actin mono - mers ( G - actin ) and actin ﬁlaments ( F - actin ) in vitro , and stimulate depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments in a pH - dependent manner 2 – 5 . Despite a wealth of biochemical data , little is known about the function of coﬁlin and related proteins in vivo . Every eukaryotic cell type examined contains at least one member of this family , sug - gesting that coﬁlin performs a universally important function 1 . This conclusion is further supported by the observations that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans , null mutations in the coﬁlin / ADF genes are lethal 6 – 8 . However , the lack of partial loss - of - function mutations in coﬁlin had previously precluded tests of the roles of this protein in living cells . We have studied the contribution of coﬁlin to actin cytoskeleton dynamics in yeast by using two temperature - sensitive coﬁlin alleles that were isolated in a systematic mutational analysis of the S . cerevisiae COF1 gene ( P . L . et al . , unpublished results ) . In both alleles , a cluster of charged residues ( Asp 10 and Glu 11 in cof1 – 5 , and Glu 134 , Arg 135 and Arg 138 in cof1 – 22 ) are replaced by alanines . The mutant alleles were integrated into the yeast genome and their phenotypes examined in haploid segregants . At temperatures suitable for robust growth ( 20 – 25 (cid:56) C ) , cof1 – 5 and cof1 – 22 strains show similar growth rates and morphology to wild - type cells . The actin ‘patches’ , which are F - actin structures asso - ciated with the cell cortex 9 , are slightly brighter in cof1 – 5 and cof1 – 22 cells than in wild - type cells , but overall organization of the cytoskeleton seems to be normal , and actin levels in these mutants are unchanged within the sensitivity of quantitative western blots ( (cid:54) 20 % ) . At a temperature that was non - permissive for growth ( 34 (cid:56) C ) , cof1 – 5 and cof1 – 22 cells became enlarged and their cortical actin patches lost their characteristic asymmetric localization ( Fig . 1 ) . After incubation at 34 (cid:56) C for 3 h , 15 – 20 % of the mutant cells have multiple nuclei . The actin patches in both cof1 – 5 and cof1 – 22 cells are unusually large ( Fig . 1 ) , consistent with the possibility that these cells have severe defects in actin ﬁlament turnover . To examine the effects of these mutations on F - actin turnover rates in vivo , we used latrunculin - A ( Lat - A ) , an actin monomer - sequestering drug . Lat - A binds close to the nucleotide - binding pocket of actin monomers , and prevents actin ﬁlament assembly while allowing disassembly 10 , 11 . In living yeast cells , Lat - A causes a rapid and speciﬁc disruption of the actin cytoskeleton 11 . Because Lat - A functions by sequestering actin monomers , the rate of disappearance of actin structures is expected to reﬂect the rate of subunit dissociation from actin ﬁlaments in vivo 11 . The Lat - A actin - ﬁlament disassembly assay was performed at both 25 (cid:56) C and 34 (cid:56) C . The rates of disassembly in wild - type and coﬁlin mutant strains seem to be independent of temperature . The data from the depolymerization assay at 25 (cid:56) C are presented in Figs 2 and 3a . In wild - type cells , most of the actin patches disappear within 2 min of addition of a high concentration ( 400 (cid:109) M ) of Lat - A . After 5 min only (cid:44) 30 % of the wild - type cells have any visible actin - ﬁlament structures when visualized by rhodamine – phalloidin staining ( Figs 2 and 3a ) . The proportion of cells with faint actin - ﬁlament staining remains unchanged at 10 min . The rate of disappearance of actin patches in cof1 – 5 cells is slightly reduced compared with wild - type cells , whereas the patches in cof1 – 22 cells disappear much more slowly ( Figs 2 and 3a ) . Most of the cof1 – 22 cells still had many bright actin patches 10 min after the addition of Lat - A , indicating that this coﬁlin mutation causes a dramatic decrease in the F - actin depoly - merization rate in vivo ( the intensity and numberof actin patches in Fig . 2i ( cof1 – 22 , 10 min ) is greater than in Fig . 2b ( COF1 , 2 min ) ) . The total disappearance of actin ﬁlament structures in cof1 – 22 cells takes approximately 20 min ( data not shown ) . Figure 2 Filamentous actin was visualized by rhodamine – phalloidin staining in wild - type ( a – c ) , cof1 – 5 ( d – f ) and cof1 – 22 ( g – i ) strains at 0 , 2 and 10min after the addition of 400 (cid:109) M Lat - A to the cultures at 25 (cid:56) C . In wild - type and cof1 – 5 cells , the actin ﬁlaments disappear rapidly . After 2min cells haveeitherveryfaintactinpatches or none at all . In contrast , actin patches in cof1 – 22 cells disappear (cid:46) 5 - fold more slowly than in the wild type . Even after 10min , most of the cof1 – 22 cells have brightly stained actin patches .

Nature © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 1997 letters to nature 80 NATURE | VOL 388 | 3 JULY 1997 The relative rates of F - actin depolymerization measured in vivo for the coﬁlin mutants correlate well with the rates by which they promote F - actin depolymerization in vitro . Recombinant Cof1 – 5 and Cof1 – 22 mutants were expressed and puriﬁed . In ﬂuorescence - monitored urea denaturation assays , both mutants show simple two - state unfolding transitions , indicating that the preparations consist of homogeneous populations of protein ( P . L . et al . , unpub - lished results ) . To assay depolymerization rates in vitro , actin ﬁlaments were ﬁrst assembled from puriﬁed yeast actin . They were then diluted 10 - fold with or without recombinant wild - type , Cof1 – 5 or Cof1 – 22 yeast coﬁlin . The depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments was followed by a decrease in light scattering at 400 nm . In this in vitro assay , performed at 25 (cid:56) C and 37 (cid:56) C , Cof1 – 5 showed a small defect in actin - ﬁlament depolymerization , and Cof1 – 22 showed a pronounced defect in actin - ﬁlament depolymerization relative to wild - type coﬁlin ( Fig . 3b ) . The magnitudes of these defects were not affected by temperature . Because Cof1 – 5 showed only a very small depolymerization defect in our in vivo and in vitro assays , it is possible that the temperature sensitivity of this mutant results from some currently unidentiﬁed activity of coﬁlin , or that the small decrease in actin dynamics precludes cell growth at elevated temperatures . When the in vitro depolymerization assay was performed by adding 100 (cid:109) M Lat - A and 1 (cid:109) M coﬁlin to 5 (cid:109) M actin ﬁlaments , results similar to those in Fig . 3b were obtained , indicating that Lat - A does not affect the rate of coﬁlin - stimulated actin depolymerization ( data not shown ) . To test the speciﬁcity of the effects for coﬁlin , we applied the Lat - A assay to yeast strains carrying deletions in genes that encode other proteins important for actin cytoskeletonorganization ( SLA2 , SAC6 and SRV2 ) 12 – 14 . In these strains , disappearance of actin patches follows kinetics similar to those observed for their wild - type parent strains ( data not shown ) . As sac6 and sla2 mutants are defective in endocytosis , these results demonstrate that endocytosis defects do not impair the entry of Lat - A into yeast cells . Further , cof1 – 5 and cof1 – 22 strains showed ﬁvefold and fourfold greater sensitivity to Lat - A , respectively , than the wild type , further suggesting that these strains do not have defects in Lat - A uptake ( data not shown ) . The availability of coﬁlin mutants that cause a dramatic decrease in actin - ﬁlament turnover provided an opportunity to determine the role of actin - ﬁlament turnover in living cells . Many components in the yeast cortical actin cytoskeleton have been shown to be important for endocytosis 13 , 15 , 16 . To test speciﬁcally whether the F - actin turnover induced by coﬁlin is necessary for endocytosis , we followed the uptake of a ﬂuid - phase marker , lucifer yellow , in cof1 – 5 and cof1 – 22 strains . At temperatures permissive for robust cell growth ( 20 and 25 (cid:56) C ) , cof1 – 5 and cof1 – 22 cells show severe defects in the uptake of lucifer yellow ( Fig . 4a ) , indicating that rapid turnover of cortical actin structures is essential for endocytosis . Consistent with this possibility , the coﬁlin mutant with the most dramatic effects on actin turnover , cof1 – 22 , had the most dramatic effects on endocytosis . It is possible that the temperature - sensitive phenotype of cof1 – 5 and cof1 – 22 mutants results from the defect in endocytosis , as an apparent dependence on endocytosis for growth at high temperatures has been reported 17 . Alternatively , cells may have a higher requirement for F - actin depolymerization at higher temperatures , or there could be another coﬁlin - dependent reaction that is sensitive to temperature . Yeast cortical actin patches have recently been shown to translo - cate within the plane of the cell cortex with a velocity up to 1 . 5 (cid:109) m s (cid:50) 1 ( refs 18 , 19 ) . As these studies failed to demonstrate a role for any known myosins in this motility 18 , it has been suggested that the actin - patch movement might be driven by a ﬁlament turnover mechanism similar to that which drives intracellular movement of Listeria monocytogenes 20 . To test whether actin - ﬁla - ment turnover is required for this motility , we transformed wild - type and cof1 – 22 mutant strains with a plasmid expressing a green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) – Abp1 fusion protein that localizes speciﬁcally to cortical actin structures 19 . At permissive temperature ( 20 – 25 (cid:56) C ) the cortical actin patches give strong ﬂuorescence and show rapid movements ( Fig . 4b ) . The quantiﬁed data from approxi - mately 700 actin - patch movements in wild - type and cof1 – 22 mutant cells is shown in Fig . 4c . There are no signiﬁcant differences either in the speed distribution or in the observed maximum velocity of actin patches between wild type and the cof1 – 22 mutant strain . Because the cof1 – 22 mutant shows a large decrease in actin - ﬁlament turnover in vivo , these results suggest that 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 20 40 60 80 100 Time ( min ) cof1 - 22 cof1 - 5 wild type C e ll s w i t h a c t i n p a t c h e s ( % ) a Figure 3 The effects of coﬁlin mutations on actin - ﬁlament depolymerization in vivo and invitro . a , Thepercentageofcellswithvisibleactin - ﬁlamentstructuresin wild - type , cof1 – 5 and cof1 – 22 cells at different times after the addition of Lat - Aat 25 (cid:56) C was quantiﬁed by rhodamine – phalloidin staining and ﬂuorescent micro - scopy .

In support of this conclusion , we ﬁnd that patch motility is unaffected by sequestration of free actin monomers through the addition of high concentrations of Lat - A to cells ( P . L . and L . Belmont , unpublished data ) . Patches continued to move even as they were disassembling . In conclusion , we have provided evidence that members of the coﬁlin / ADF family promote actin - ﬁlament depolymerization in vivo and are required for rapid cycles of actin assembly and disassembly . It has been shown that coﬁlin / ADF promotes actin - ﬁlament depolymerization in cell extracts 21 , 22 . Our data extend this observation to living cells , and identify a process in which rapid turnover of actin ﬁlaments is essential . These ﬁndings , considered with the intimate coupling of actin dynamics with actin function , may explainwhy coﬁlin is expressed ubiquitously and is essential for viability in every cell type in which its gene has been mutated . The actin - associated activities of coﬁlin have been shown to be regulated by pH , phosphorylation and phosphoinositides 3 , 23 – 25 . However , as we were unable to detect any differences in Lat - A - induced dis - assembly rates among cells at different stages of the cell cycle ( data not shown ) , our data indicate that in yeast , coﬁlin is active throughout the cell cycle . Despite speculation that cortical actin - patch motility might be driven by an assembly coupled mechanism akin to that in Listeria bacteria 20 , loss of coﬁlin function did not have consequences for cortical actin - patch motility . Considered with a previous study that failed to ﬁnd an effect of mutation of any of the yeast myosin genes on patch motility 18 , our ﬁndings suggest that patch motility might be driven by a different mechanism .

Methods Yeast strains . The construction of cof1 mutants will be described in more detail elsewhere ( P . L . et al . , unpublished data ) . Brieﬂy , the LEU2 marker was inserted 91 base pairs downstream from the end of the coﬁlin open reading frame ( ORF ) in pBluescript SK plasmid ( Strategene ) carrying COF1 . The site - directed mutations were created by oligonucleotide - based mutagenesis ( Transformer , Clontech ) . The plasmids were linearized and COF1 , cof1 – 5 and cof1 – 22 were integrated into a COF1 / cof1 - ∆ 1 : : HIS3 hemizygote strain ( DDY427 ) . Integrants were identiﬁed by screening for loss of the HIS3 marker and gain of the LEU2 marker . These cells were sporulated and the phenotypes were scored in haploid segregants . Each mutation was conﬁrmed by PCR ampliﬁcation and restriction endonuclease digestions . The haploid yeast strains carrying deletions of SLA2 , SAC6 and SRV2 and their parent strains have been described 12 , 26 , 27 . Cellbiologicalmethods .

The ﬂuid - phase endocytosis assay was performed at 25 (cid:56) C as described 28 . For the in vivo Lat - A depolymerization assay , cells were grown at 20 (cid:56) C at A 600 ¼ 0 : 2 , and Lat - A was added to cultures to a ﬁnal concentration of 400 (cid:109) M . The cells were incubated at 25 or 34 (cid:56) C and 250 - (cid:109) l samples of cells were ﬁxed at 0 , 2 and 10min with 5 % formaldehyde , and actin - ﬁlament structures were visualized by rhodamine - phalloidin staining .

The sensitivities of wild - type , cof1 – 5 and cof1 – 22 cells to lat - Awere examined in a halo - assay 11 in which ﬁlters spotted with Lat - A were deposited on lawns of yeast and the diameter of zones of growth inhibition measured . For actin - patch movement studies , the COF1 and cof1 – 22 strains were transformed with a plasmid carrying GFP linked to Abp1 ( ref . 19 ) . Cells from such transformants were grown at 20 (cid:56) Cto an A 600 of (cid:44) 0 . 4 , and movementof actin patches was followed with Zeiss Axiovert 100TV microscope . Images from about 400 patches in 5 unbudded cells from each strain were collected using a Princeton Instruments ST - 138 camera / controller with a Kodak KAF1400 chip ( each pixel is 0 : 069 (cid:109) m (cid:51) 0 : 069 (cid:109) m ) . Frames from the cells were recorded at intervals of 0 . 95 to 1 . 25s and the data analysed using the Animate program ( written by A . Mallavarapu ) . The maximum speeds observed in our study ( 0 . 75 (cid:109) ms (cid:50) 1 ) are approximately twofold slower than the maximum speeds previously reported 18 . This might result from differences in yeast strain backgrounds or the differences in the time resolution of image acquisition ( the camera system in ref . 18 recorded frames with 0 . 2 - s intervals compared to (cid:44) 1 - s intervals in this study ) .

The COF1 yeast coﬁlin gene was ampliﬁed by PCR , subcloned into pGEX2T vector ( Pharmacia ) , and expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 cellsas a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusionprotein .

Fusion proteins were puriﬁed byglutathione – agarose afﬁnity chromatography 29 . Allconstructs madebyPCRweresequencedtoexcludethepossibilityofundesiredmutations . Coﬁlin was cleaved from GST by thrombin and puriﬁed by gel - ﬁltration ( Superdex - 75 , Pharmacia ) .

For the depolymer - ization assay , F - actin and coﬁlinwere mixed in a cuvette to ﬁnal concentrations of 0 . 5 (cid:109) M , and the depolymerization of F - actin was followed by decrease in light scattering at 400nm .

Smad2 and Smad4 are related tumour - suppressor proteins 1 , 2 , which , when stimulated by the growth factor TGF - (cid:98) , form a complex to inhibit growth 3 . The effector function of Smad2 and Smad4 is located in the conserved carboxy - terminal domain ( C domain ) of these proteins and is inhibited by the presence of their amino - terminal domains ( N domain ) 4 , 5 . This inhibitory function of the N domain is shown here to involve an interaction with the C domain that prevents the association of Smad2 with Smad4 . This inhibitory function is increased in tumour - derived forms of Smad2 and 4 that carry a missense mutation in a conserved N domain arginine residue . The mutant N domains have an increased afﬁnity for their respective C domains , inhibit the Smad2 – Smad4 interaction , and prevent TGF (cid:98) - induced Smad2 – Smad4 association and signalling . Whereas mutations in the C domain disrupt the effector function of the Smad proteins , N - domain arginine mutations inhibit SMAD signalling through a gain of autoinhibitory function . Gain of autoinhibitory function is a new mechanism for inactivating tumour suppressors . SMAD proteins are central to signalling by the TGF - (cid:98) family of growth factors 6 . An effector function of the C domain and an inhibitory function of the N domain of Smad proteins were discovered during studies on the mesoderm - inducing activity of Smad2 in Xenopus embryo explants 5 and on the transcriptional activity of various Smad proteins in mammalian cells 4 . SMAD proteins exist as homo - oligomers that form functional hetero - oligomeric complexes in response to TGF - (cid:98) and related factors 3 . These complexes are formed by association of a pathway - restricted SMAD with the shared SMAD , Smad4 ( also known as DPC4 or deleted in pancreatic carcinoma 4 ) . Thus Smad1 associates with Smad4 in response to stimulation by bone morphogenic protein
