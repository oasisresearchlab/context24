The Arp2 / 3 complex , first isolated from Acanthamoeba castellani by affinity chromatography on profilin , consists of seven polypeptides ; two actin - related proteins , Arp2 and Arp3 ; and five apparently novel proteins , p40 , p35 , p19 , p18 , and p14 ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) . The complex is homogeneous by hydrody - namic criteria with a Stokes’ radius of 5 . 3 nm by gel fil - tration , sedimentation coefficient of 8 . 7 S , and molecu - lar mass of 197 kD by analytical ultracentrifugation . The stoichiometry of the subunits is 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 , indi - cating the purified complex contains one copy each of seven polypeptides . In electron micrographs , the com - plex has a bilobed or horseshoe shape with outer di - mensions of (cid:122) 13 (cid:51) 10 nm , and mathematical models of such a shape and size are consistent with the measured hydrodynamic properties . Chemical cross - linking with a battery of cross - linkers of different spacer arm lengths and chemical reactivities identify the following nearest neighbors within the complex : Arp2 and p40 ; Arp2 and p35 ; Arp3 and p35 ; Arp3 and either p18 or p19 ; and p19 and p14 . By fluorescent antibody staining with anti - p40 and - p35 , the complex is concentrated in the cortex of the ameba , especially in linear structures , possibly actin filament bundles , that lie perpendicular to the leading edge . Purified Arp2 / 3 complex binds ac - tin filaments with a K d of 2 . 3 (cid:109) M and a stoichiometry of approximately one complex molecule per actin mono - mer . In electron micrographs of negatively stained sam - ples , Arp2 / 3 complex decorates the sides of actin fila - ments . EDC / NHS cross - links actin to Arp3 , p35 , and a low molecular weight subunit , p19 , p18 , or p14 . We pro - pose structural and topological models for the Arp2 / 3 complex and suggest that affinity for actin filaments ac - counts for the localization of complex subunits to actin - rich regions of Acanthamoeba . A ctin is one of the most abundant , highly conserved and well characterized of all eukaryotic proteins . The actin - based cytoskeleton determines the shape , passive mechanical properties , and motility of most eu - karyotic cells . The recently discovered families of actin - related proteins ( Arps ) 1 appear to be highly conserved as well , but their functions are as yet poorly understood ( Mullins et al . , 1996 ; Schroer et al . , 1996 ) . The three major classes of actin - related proteins—Arp1 , Arp2 , and Arp3— are grouped according to their degree of similarity to actin . Arp1 is most closely related to actin ( 50 – 60 % sequence identity ) , and this class is by far the most well character - ized . Arp1 is associated with the dynactin complex , a mul - timeric protein complex required for dynein - based vesicle motility . Ultrastructural and topological analysis of the dynactin complex has revealed that Arp1 forms short ( 37 nm ) filaments , similar to actin filaments , that may function as attachment sites for cargo vesicles ( Schroer and Sheetz , 1991 ; Schafer et al . , 1994 ; Schroer et al . , 1996 ) . Arp2 and Arp3 are less closely related to actin ( 40 – 50 % and 30 – 40 % sequence identity , respectively ) and appear to be incapable of forming actin - like filaments ( Lees - Miller et al . , 1992 ; Schwob and Martin , 1992 ) . The genes for Arp2 and Arp3 are ubiquitous in eukaryotes , appar - ently as ancient as actin and essential in yeast ( for recent reviews see Frankel and Mooseker , 1996 ; Mullins et al . 1996 ) . Both Arp2 and Arp3 are major cellular proteins in Acanthamoeba castellani , present at micromolar levels and concentrated in the actin - rich cortex ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Kelleher et al . , 1995 ) . The primary structures of Arp2 and Arp3 suggest that both proteins fold like actin with a similar three - dimensional core structure , but with different residues exposed on the surfaces ( Kabsch et al . , 1985 ; Kelleher et al . , 1995 ) . We expect , therefore , that each protein interacts with a different set of accessory pro - teins , and with very few conventional actin - binding pro - teins ( Kelleher et al . , 1995 ; Mullins et al . , 1996 ) .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 136 , 1997 332 Arp3 are both components of a multiprotein particle , the Arp2 / 3 complex , initially purified from Acanthamoeba castellani by affinity chromatography on the actin - binding protein , profilin ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) . In addition to Arp2 and Arp3 , the purified complex contains five polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 40 , 35 , 19 , 18 , and 14 kD . Partial amino acid sequences of p40 , p35 , p19 , and p18 show no significant homology to previously described sequences ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Mullins , R . D . , J . Vandekerckhove , and T . D . Pollard , unpublished results ) . Neither Arp2 nor Arp3 has been purified for functional studies , so their biochemical activities and cellular functions are poorly understood . Arp2 null mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae arrest late in the cell cycle and heterozygote dip - loid cells have delayed cytokinesis ( Schwob and Martin , 1992 ) . Arp2 colocalizes with actin in both Acanthamoeba castellani ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Kelleher et al . , 1995 ) and S . cerevisiae ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ) . The complex binds pro - filin affinity columns , and an apparent homologue of the Acanthamoeba p40 has been cloned in Schizosaccharomy - ces pombe based on suppression of a profilin mutation ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1996 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex , therefore , appears to be a ubiquitous component of eu - karyotic cells and may be involved in actin cytoskeletal dy - namics . To better understand the function of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex in living cells , we have studied its ultrastructure , to - pology , and interaction with actin filaments . We used analytical ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy of rotary - shadowed specimens to determine the structure and the native molecular weight of purified Arp2 / 3 com - plex . We also used a variety of chemical cross - linkers to identify Arp2 - and Arp3 - specific binding proteins and to establish nearest neighbor relationships for the subunits . Based on chemical cross - linking and electron microscopy , we propose a model for the spatial organization of these subunits . Finally , we show that purified Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the sides of actin filaments with micromolar affin - ity at a 1 : 1 stoichiometry with actin monomers . This actin - binding activity is sufficient to explain the localization of the complex to actin - rich structures in Acanthamoeba and is further biochemical evidence for the involvement of the complex in cytoskeletal function . Materials and Methods Purification We purified Arp2 / 3 complex in two steps , according to the method de - scribed in Fig . 1 of Machesky et al . ( 1994 ) . Ameba extracts were dialyzed into 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 7 . 5 mM Na 4 P 2 O 7 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride and chromatographed on a column of DEAE - cellulose equilibrated with 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 10 mM KCl , and 1 mM DTT . Flow - through from the DEAE - cellulose column was col - lected and fractionated by poly - l - proline Sepharose affinity chromatogra - phy ( Kaiser et al . , 1989 ) . Elution with 0 . 4 M MgCl 2 released Arp2 / 3 com - plex from the column . Profilin was subsequently eluted with 8 M urea . Purified Arp2 / 3 complex was dialyzed into buffer containing 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 . 0 mM DTT , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 ( buffer C ) and concentrated by dialysis against solid sucrose . 800 g of wet cells yielded (cid:122) 2 mg purified complex . Preparation of Actin Ameba actin was purified from DEAE column fractions ( Pollard , 1984 ) . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified from acetone powder by the method of Spudich and Watt ( 1971 ) as modified by MacLean - Fletcher and Pollard ( 1980 ) . Actin Copelleting Assay Arp2 / 3 complex was prespun at 70 , 000 rpm in a ( model TLA 100 . 2 ; Beck - man Instrs . , Fullerton , CA ) rotor ( 200 , 000 g ) for 1 h at 4 (cid:56) C . The superna - tant was then incubated with various concentrations of filamentous actin , either already polymerized or polymerized in the presence of Arp2 / 3 com - plex . The mixture was then spun at 200 , 000 g for 30 min at 24 (cid:56) C to pellet ac - tin filaments . Supernatants and pellets were collected and proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE . Actin and various complex members were quantitated in supernatant and pellet fractions by two - dimensional scan - ning densitometry of wet , Coomassie - stained gels . Data from densitome - try scans were analyzed by the program Collage ( Fotodyne , New Berlin , WI ) , and dissociation constants were calculated by least squares fitting of a rectangular hyperbola . Other Interactions with Actin Concentrations of Arp2 / 3 complex in the 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 (cid:109) M range were tested for interaction with actin in the following assays . Sequestration : we mea - sured critical concentration at 24 (cid:56) C in 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 . Nucleation : we measured the time course of spontaneous polymerization of 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 (cid:109) M actin by measuring fluorescence of pyrene - labeled actin ( Pollard and Cooper , 1986 ) at 24 (cid:56) C in 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 . Severing : we measured the high shear viscosity of 2 (cid:109) M actin in an Ostwald - type viscometer ( MacLean - Fletcher and Pol - lard , 1980 ) at 24 (cid:56) C in 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 . Antibody Preparation Two New Zealand white rabbits ( Bunnyville Farms , Littletown , PA ) , JH48 and JH49 , were immunized subcutaneously in 10 – 20 locations with either p35 ( JH48 ) or p40 ( JH49 ) . Proteins were purified for injection by gel elec - trophoresis . Arp2 / 3 complex was purified by poly - l - proline affinity chro - matography ( see Fig . 1 ) and protein subunits were separated by SDS - PAGE . The gel was stained with 0 . 2 % Coomassie blue , 0 . 1 % SDS , 192 mM glycine , 25 mM Tris base , pH 8 . 3 , and destained in distilled , deionized wa - ter . Gel slices were excised , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and pulverized with a mortar and pestle . The powder containing (cid:122) 50 (cid:109) g protein was added to 0 . 5 ml Freund’s complete adjuvant and emulsified with a probe sonicator ( Branson , VWR , Bridgeport , NJ ) . This mixture was injected subcutane - ously at multiple sites after a preimmune bleed . 6 wk later , the rabbit was boosted with a similar emulsion made with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant . Immune serum from each rabbit reacted with multiple bands on immuno - blots of whole cell lysates but with only a single band on immunoblots of purified Arp2 / 3 complex . Monospecific rabbit antibodies against Acanthamoeba Arp2 and Arp3 were prepared by Kelleher et al . ( 1995 ) . Mouse mAbs that react with ameba actin were provided by Dr . James Lessard of the University of Cin - cinnati ( Cincinnati , OH ) ( Lessard , 1988 ) . Immunofluorescence Microscopy Antibodies used for immunofluorescence studies were affinity purified by incubation with p35 and p40 on immunoblot strips ( Pollard , 1984 ) . Cy - 2 labeled goat anti – mouse and Cy - 3 labeled goat anti – rabbit secondary anti - bodies were obtained from Biological Detection Incorporated ( Pitts - burgh , PA ) . BODIPY - labeled phalloidin was obtained from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) . Micrographs were made using a microscope ( model Orthoplan ; Leitz , Inc . , Rockleigh , NJ ) with a 1 . 4 N . A . Planapo 63 (cid:51) oil immersion objective ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . , Thornwood , NY ) . Confocal im - ages were made by an argon ion laser confocal system ( model MRC - 600 ; BioRad Labs , Hercules , CA ) attached to a microscope ( model Optiphot ; Nikon Inc . , Melville , NY ) . Chemical Cross - linking Chemical cross - linkers , disuccinimidyl glutarate ( DSG ) , disuccinimidyl tartarate ( DST ) , dithiobis ( succinimidyl propionate ) ( DSP ) , bismaleimi - dohexane ( BMH ) , and 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) - carbodiimide hydrochloride ( EDC ) , along with N - hydroxysuccinimide ( NHS ) were ob - Mullins et al . Arp2 / 3 Complex 333 tained from Pierce ( Rockford , IL ) . Stock solutions of cross - linkers ( 10 (cid:51) ) were made fresh in dry DMSO immediately before use . Final concentra - tion of DMSO in all reactions was (cid:60) 10 % . All cross - linking reactions were carried out for 1 h at room temperature . Analytical Ultracentrifugation Experiments were carried out at 20 – 23 (cid:56) C in an analytical ultracentrifuge model E or Optima series XLA ( Beckman Instrs . , Fullerton , CA ) equipped with a real - time , video - based data acquisition system and Ray - leigh optics ( Liu and Stafford , 1992 ; Stafford et al . , 1995 ) . Data collection and analysis , including determination of diffusion coefficient and molecular weight from sedimentation velocity data , were carried out as described previously ( Stafford , 1992 , 1994 ) . Analytical ultracentrifugation was car - ried out in one of two buffers : 100 mM NaCl , 100 mM glycine , 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM EGTA ( buffer B ) or in 20 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM EGTA . Amino acid analysis was performed by Boston Analytical Biotechnology ( Boston , MA ) . The partial specific volume of 0 . 74 cm 3 / gm and hydration of 0 . 32 g / g used in analysis of ultracentrifugation data were calculated from the mass averaged contributions of individual amino acids ( Kuntz and Kauzmann , 1974 ; Perkins , 1986 ) . Rotary Shadowing Eight rotary - shadowing runs were performed on purified Arp2 / 3 complex obtained from three different protein preparations . Purified Arp2 / 3 com - plex in buffer C was mixed with an equal volume of glycerol and then im - mediately sprayed by a nebulizer ( Fowler and Erickson , 1979 ; Tyler and Branton , 1980 ; Fowler and Aebi , 1983 ) onto the clean surface of a freshly cleaved mica chip . Samples were then dried under vacuum at 1 – 10 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 7 torr in a ( model BAF 400 D ; Balzers , Fürstentum , Liectenstein ) vacuum evaporation unit . Time between dilution and spraying was typically (cid:44) 3 min . Dried specimens were rotary - shadowed with platinum at an angle of 5 or 6 (cid:56) and stabilized with carbon . The carbon - platinum replicas were then floated off the mica surface in distilled water containing approximately 1 part per 10 , 000 photoflo ( Eastman Kodak Company , Rochester , NY ) to reduce surface tension and picked up from below on 200 - or 300 - mesh electron microscope grids ( Ernest Fullam Inc . , Latham , NY ) . Electron mi - crographs were made using a JEM 100CX ( JEOL U . S . A . , Inc . , Peabody , MA ) at a nominal magnification of 83 , 000 (cid:51) or an EM10A ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) at a nominal magnification of 80 , 000 (cid:51) . Actual magnification on both microscopes was determined from electron micrographs of negatively stained tropomyosin paracrystals taken at the same settings . Negative Staining Negative staining of Acanthamoeba actin filaments in the presence and absence of Arp2 / 3 complex was carried out according to the method of Aebi et al . ( 1981 ) . Briefly , carbon - coated electron microscope grids made hydrophilic by glow discharge for 20 s in a reduced atmosphere of air ( Aebi and Pollard , 1987 ) were incubated for 30 s on drops containing (cid:122) 0 . 1 mg / ml protein . Grids were then stained for a total of 30 s by incubation on five successive drops of 1 % uranyl formate . Uranyl formate was made fresh before each use and protected from light . Electron micrographs were made on a microscope ( model 100 CX ; JEOL U . S . A . , Inc . ) at a nom - inal magnification of 46 , 000 (cid:51) . Results Purification of the Arp2 / 3 Complex We purified Arp2 / 3 complex in two steps ( Fig . 1 A ) . Most of the Arp2 and Arp3 in ameba extracts is soluble ( Kelle - her et al . , 1995 ) and voids along with profilin when passed through a DEAE - cellulose anion - exchange column ( Ma - chesky et al . , 1994 ) . This step removes the majority of cel - lular protein from the extract , including all of the actin . When the DEAE flow - through fraction passes through a poly - l - proline – Sepharose column , all of the profilin ( Kai - ser et al . , 1989 ) and about 10 % of the Arp2 / 3 complex bind . We presume that the bound fraction of the complex is retained by profilin and is not bound directly to the col - umn since profilin coupled directly to Sepharose binds the complex ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) and purified complex does not bind poly - l - proline Sepharose ( data not shown ) . The remainder of the complex that is not retained on the poly - l - proline column can be purified by conventional chromatography ( Kelleher , J . , R . D . Mullins , V . K . Vinson , and T . D . Pollard , in manuscript in preparation ) . Elution of the poly - l - proline column with 400 mM MgCl 2 releases purified Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 1 B ) . Subsequent elution with 8 M urea releases pure profilin . In a previous study ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) , four polypeptides from the com - plex bound to immobilized profilin and six polypeptides copurified by poly - l - proline affinity chromatography . In the present study , we report that all seven members of the Arp2 / 3 complex previously purified by ion - exchange chro - matography also copurify by poly - l - proline affinity chro - matography ( Fig . 1 B ) . Arp2 / 3 complex purified in this manner is entirely free of contaminating actin and profilin as judged by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies . Composition and Stoichiometry . To determine if the seven polypeptides purified by poly - l - proline affinity chroma - tography formed a single homogeneous complex , we chro - matographed purified Arp2 / 3 complex on size - exclusion columns . Sephacryl S300 and Superdex S200 columns equilibrated with either B buffer or C buffer ( see Materi - als and Methods ) were calibrated with size standards , in - cluding catalase ( R s (cid:53) 5 . 2 nm ) and mouse IgG ( R s (cid:53) 5 . 8 nm ) , by the method of Ackers ( 1967 ) . On both columns , all seven polypeptides of the purified Arp2 / 3 complex Figure 1 . SDS - PAGE of fractions taken at each step in the purifi - cation of Arp2 / 3 complex from Acanthamoeba . Bands are stained with Coomassie blue . ( A ) An extract of soluble proteins ( lane 1 ) was first passed over a DE - 52 anion - exchange column in a low ionic strength buffer . Fractions that flowed through DEAE ( lane 2 ) were pooled and loaded onto a poly - l - proline – Sepharose affinity column . Arp2 / 3 complex ( lane 3 ) was eluted from the column with 0 . 4 M MgCl 2 . ( B ) Purified Arp2 / 3 complex , Arp3 , Arp2 , and five associated proteins . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 136 , 1997 334 eluted together as a single symmetric peak with a Stokes’ radius of 5 . 3 (cid:54) 0 . 1 nm ( Fig . 2 ; n (cid:53) 4 , all values are re - ported (cid:54) standard deviation ) . In addition , monospecific antibodies against Arp2 , p40 , and p35 coimmunoprecipi - tated all seven members of the complex from whole ameba cell extracts ( data not shown ) . To determine subunit stoichiometry , we separated the components of purified Arp2 / 3 complex by gel electro - phoresis in SDS and quantitated proteins by two - dimen - sional densitometry of Coomassie - stained gels . Assuming equal dye binding , the four highest molecular weight com - ponents—Arp3 , Arp2 , p40 , and p35—are present in equimolar proportions ( Table I ) as reported in prelimi - nary studies ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) . In addition , p14 also appears to be 1 : 1 with these components . Since p18 and p19 are not resolved completely on our gels , we integrated the two together . The average stoichiometry of p18 plus p19 is 1 . 6 ( Table I ) , so the stoichiometry of each subunit is (cid:122) 0 . 8 . This slightly low value may be due to differences in dye binding since Coomassie staining of p18 is consistently darker than p19 ( Fig . 1 B ) . Physical Properties of the Arp2 / 3 Complex Analytical Ultracentrifugation . At concentrations above 70 nM , the Arp2 / 3 complex sediments in B buffer as a single homogeneous peak at 8 . 7 (cid:54) 0 . 2 S ( n (cid:53) 6 ) . Fig . 3 shows the time - independent distributions of sedimentation coeffi - cients in purified Arp2 / 3 samples at concentrations be - tween 0 . 07 and 1 . 9 (cid:109) M . When normalized by dilution factor , these distributions are identical at the highest concentra - tions . Dilution to 70 nM or below causes the distribution of sedimentation coefficients to broaden and shift to lower values , consistent with dissociation of one or more sub - units ( Fig . 3 , inset ) . By fitting sedimentation velocity pro - files collected at concentrations above 100 nM to single Gaussian peaks ( Stafford , 1992 , 1994 ) , we determined the diffusion coefficient of the complex to be 3 . 92 cm 2 s (cid:50) 1 . From the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients obtained by sedimentation velocity experiments , we calculated a mo - lecular mass of 197 (cid:54) 10 kD for the Arp2 / 3 complex . The hydrodynamic parameters measured by ultracentrifuga - tion predict a Stokes’ radius of 5 . 4 (cid:54) 0 . 3 nm , which is in good agreement with the 5 . 3 nm value determined by gel filtration .

Conditions : 200 (cid:109) l of puri - fied Arp2 / 3 complex at 0 . 5 mg / ml was run on a 1 (cid:51) 55 - cm column of Sephacryl S300 equilibrated with 100 mM NaCl , 100 mM gly - cine , 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT , 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 0 . Fractions of 0 . 4 ml were collected and protein concentration measured by the Bradford ( 1976 ) assay . Two column runs were averaged to produce the trace . Fractions from one run were precipitated with methanol / chloroform , and proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE and stained with Coo - massie brilliant blue ( inset ) . Figure 3 .

Gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue , densitometrically scanned in two dimensions , and digitized . Intensities were integrated over each band using the image analysis program Collage ( Fotodyne , New Berlin , WI ) . Integrated values were divided by the apparent molecular weight of each subunit . For each of the five scans , the values obtained for Arp3 , Arp2 , p40 , and p35 were averaged ; this number was used to normalize the values for all six bands . Mullins et al . Arp2 / 3 Complex 335 Electron Microscopy . We studied the ultrastructure of the Arp2 / 3 complex by rotary replicating it with platinum and visualizing it by electron microscopy ( Fig . 4 ) . In typi - cal fields , the Arp2 / 3 complex appears globular and slightly asymmetric with an average aspect ratio of 1 . 2 (cid:54) 0 . 1 ( n (cid:53) 24 ) . The maximum dimension of the shadowed complex is 19 . 3 (cid:54) 1 . 5 nm and the minimum dimension is 16 . 0 (cid:54) 1 . 0 nm ( n (cid:53) 24 ) . When actin filaments are included with the complex , their measured diameter is 16 nm , so we esti - mate that the shadowing procedure adds (cid:122) 3 nm of plati - num to each side of a shadowed particle . Correcting for this coating , the average outer dimensions of the Arp2 / 3 complex are 13 . 3 (cid:51) 10 . 0 nm . Most of the replicated com - plex molecules are bilobed in appearance with a cleft that divides the molecule into two approximately equal halves . In fields containing multiple molecules of Arp2 / 3 complex , these clefts are randomly oriented , suggesting they are not systematic shadowing artifacts ( Fig . 4 B ) . Fig . 5 shows rep - resentative morphologies of rotary - shadowed molecules . Half of the molecules ( 51 % , n (cid:53) 251 molecules from eight fields and two separate protein preparations ) appear com - pact and globular , and only slightly bilobed ( Fig . 5 A ) . The other half ( 49 % ) exhibit a more clearly defined cleft . Of the latter half , 90 % have a narrow central cleft extending (cid:122) 75 % along the length of the molecule , leaving the two halves of the molecule closely opposed ( Fig . 5 B ) . The re - maining 10 % have a distinct horseshoe shape with a prom - inent central cleft separating the halves of the molecule ( Fig . 5 C ) . Determination of Nearest - Neighbor Subunits in the Arp2 / 3 Complex by Chemical Cross - linking We used a battery of chemical cross - linkers with various spacer arm lengths and chemical reactivities to probe sub - unit topology of the Arp2 / 3 complex . We used low protein concentrations ( 1 – 2 (cid:109) M ) to minimize intermolecular cross - linking . We analyzed reaction products by SDS - PAGE Figure 4 .

Samples were vacuum - dried and rotary - replicated with platinum at 6 (cid:56) and carbon - coated at 60 (cid:56) . ( A ) Field of particles .

Gallery of electron micrographs and camera lucida in - terpretations of purified Arp2 / 3 complex particles prepared by rotary replication . Conditions : See Fig . 4 . ( A ) Approximately half ( 51 % , n (cid:53) 251 ) of the molecules surveyed displayed a compact , globular morphology with only a slightly bilobed appearance . ( B ) Nearly half of the molecules ( 44 % ) displayed a distinct bilobed morphology with a clearly defined central cleft . ( C ) A smaller number of molecules ( 5 % ) had a splayed , horseshoe shape with a large central cleft . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 136 , 1997 336 and immunoblotting with subunit - specific antibodies . Five different cross - linkers produced heterodimers of subunits from the complex . The sulfhydryl - reactive cross - linker BMH cross - links Arp2 to p40 . Incubation of Arp2 / 3 complex with BMH generates a new 83 - kD band and significantly reduces the amount of Arp2 and p40 visible on Coomassie - stained polyacrylamide gels ( Fig . 6 ) . Of the four monospecific an - tibodies against complex members , only those raised against Arp2 and p40 react with this cross - linked band . The spacer arm length of BMH is relatively long ( 1 . 9 nm ) , so , to control for intercomplex cross - linking , we ran control and cross - linked samples of Arp2 / 3 complex over a Super - dex S200 size - exclusion column . Both samples eluted with the same partition coefficient , well within the fractionation range of the column , indicating no significant dimerization of complex in the cross - linked sample . By SDS - PAGE , the peak column fractions contained the 83 - kD cross - linked product but no detectable , uncross - linked Arp2 or p40 ( data not shown ) . The amine - reactive , oxidizable cross - linker DST cross - links Arp2 to p35 and Arp3 to p18 or p19 . These reaction products appear as two bands at 95 and 67 kD ( Fig . 7 A ) . The larger product reacts with antibodies to Arp2 and p35 ( Fig . 7 B ) . To determine if one or more of the low molecu - lar weight components of the complex was also involved , we cut the cross - linked band out of a wet gel , extracted the protein , and incubated it with sodium periodate to oxidize DST cross - links . When analyzed by SDS - PAGE , the oxi - dized sample contained bands corresponding to Arp2 , p35 , as well as two bands that appear to be breakdown prod - ucts of p35 . None of the bands , however , correspond to low molecular weight components of the complex ( Fig . 7 C ) . We conclude , therefore , that this product is indeed a heterodimer of Arp2 and p35 . Only antibodies against Arp3 react with the smaller DST – cross - linked product ( Fig . 7 B ) , suggesting that DST cross - links Arp3 to a subunit for which we have no specific antibodies . To determine if this is the case , we extracted the cross - linked band from a wet gel , oxidized the cross - link with sodium periodate , and analyzed the products . We recovered two polypeptides , the larger corresponding in size to Arp3 , and the smaller to either p18 or p19 ( Fig . 7 C ) . After this harsh treatment , the smaller polypeptide did not run as a sharp band , and it was not possible , based on comparison to native complex in the same gel , to deter - mine precisely the identity of the lower band . We conclude that the smaller DST – cross - linked product is a hetero - dimer of Arp3 and either p18 or p19 . The amine - reactive cross - linkers DSP and DSG cross - link p19 and p14 . Cross - linking of Arp2 / 3 complex by ei - ther of these cross - linkers produces a 29 - kD band ( Fig . 8 ) . Figure 6 .

Uncross - linked polypeptides were separated by SDS - PAGE and stained with silver . Positions of the complex subunits from adjacent lanes on the same gel are marked . Arp2 is cross - linked to p35 and Arp3 to either p18 or p19 . Mullins et al . Arp2 / 3 Complex 337 DSP - induced cross - links can be reversed by reduction with (cid:98) - mercaptoethanol . We excised the 29 - kD band from a wet gel , extracted and boiled it in sample buffer contain - ing (cid:98) - mercaptoethanol , and ran it on a second gel . Bands were detected at 19 and 14 kD , suggesting that the 29 - kD product is a heterodimer of p14 and p19 . The zero - length heterobifunctional cross - linker EDC , used with NHS , produces several cross - linked products recognized by monospecific antibodies to complex sub - units ( Fig . 9 ) . Four sets of these bands appear to be het - erodimers . Antibodies against Arp2 and p40 both recog - nize an 85 - kD band ( Fig . 9 B , lanes 1 and 2 ) . Combined with the BMH cross - linking result from above , this is strong evidence for a direct association of Arp2 with p40 . EDC / NHS also produces a 75 - kD band recognized by monospecific antibodies against p35 and p40 ( Fig . 9 B , lanes 2 and 3 ) and a prominent band at 88 kD recognized by antibodies against Arp3 and p35 ( Fig . 9 B , lanes 3 and 4 ) . These results indicate that p35 is in close proximity to p40 and to Arp3 . Two additional EDC / NHS - generated bands , at 66 and 70 kD , are recognized by antibodies against Arp3 . The relatively small apparent molecular weights of these bands and the fact that they are not recognized by any other monospecific antibodies indicates they are het - erodimers of Arp3 cross - linked to small molecular weight members of the complex . The two bands run close to - gether on SDS - PAGE at approximately the sizes expected for heterodimers of Arp3 with p18 and p19 . Also , DST cross - links one or both of these subunits to Arp3 , suggest - ing that the two new bands are composed of Arp3 cross - linked to p18 and to p19 . EDC / NHS also produce additional bands with higher apparent molecular weights . These appear to be higher or - der structures—heterotrimers , heterotetramers , or larger . Immunofluorescence Localization of p35 and p40 in Acanthamoeba Dual localization of actin filaments with BODIPY - phalloi - din and of p35 or p40 with fluorescent antibodies showed both p35 and p40 throughout the cytoplasm , concentrated around unidentified intracellular vacuoles and enriched along with actin in the cell cortex ( Fig . 10 ) . Most of the staining in the cell cortex is associated with actin filament fibrils . Some fibrils were in microspikes projecting from the cell surface ( Fig . 10 C (cid:48) ) , while others were deeper in the cell cortex ( e . g . , compare Fig . 10 , A and A (cid:48) ) . Confocal images of 0 . 8 - (cid:109) m sections ( Fig . 10 , E (cid:57) and F (cid:57) ) confirmed the dramatic enrichment of p35 and p40 in the cell cortex and their association with radially projecting fibrils . Interaction of the Arp2 / 3 Complex with Actin Purified Arp2 / 3 complex binds to rabbit skeletal muscle actin filaments in a pelleting assay but has no detectable activity in assays for actin monomer sequestration , nucle - ation of actin filament assembly , or severing actin fila - Figure 8 .

The DSP – cross - linked band ( * ) was excised from a wet gel , flash - frozen , pulverized , and boiled in sample buffer containing (cid:98) - mercaptoethanol to reduce the DSP cross - link . Uncross - linked polypeptides were separated by SDS - PAGE and stained with silver ( Reduced ) . Positions of the complex subunits run in adjacent lanes on the same gel are marked . The 29 - kD cross - linked product produced by DSP is a heterodimer of p19 and p14 . Figure 9 .

Arp2 / 3 Complex 339 ments ( see Materials and Methods ) . All seven bands of the complex pellet with actin filaments , regardless of whether the actin is polymerized in the presence of complex or po - lymerized before it is added to complex ( Fig . 11 ) , indicat - ing that copelleting is not due to copolymerization of Arp2 and / or Arp3 with actin . The dependence of the pelleting of p14 , p18 , p19 , and p35 on actin concentration fit a hyper - bolic curve yielding an apparent K d of 2 . 3 (cid:54) 0 . 3 (cid:109) M ( R 2 (cid:53) 0 . 975 ) . The other bands behaved similarly but were not re - solved well enough from actin for accurate quantitation . We did not rigorously determine the number of Arp2 / 3 complex – binding sites on an actin filament , but deter - mined that 1 (cid:109) M filamentous actin bound 0 . 45 (cid:54) 0 . 04 (cid:109) M of a 2 . 6 (cid:109) M solution of Arp2 / 3 complex ( n (cid:53) 6 bands ana - lyzed from two copelleting experiments , data not shown ) . This is in good agreement with the value of 0 . 48 (cid:109) M pre - dicted from a model in which each actin monomer in the filament binds one molecule of Arp2 / 3 complex with a K d of 2 . 3 (cid:109) M . We conclude that the Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the sides of actin filaments at a stoichiometry of one actin monomer per Arp2 / 3 - binding site . By electron microscopy of negatively stained samples , Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the sides of actin filaments . At low concentrations of actin ( 100 nM ) , Arp2 / 3 complex decorates Acanthamoeba actin filaments along their entire lengths ( Fig . 12 ) . The diameter of decorated filaments is 24 (cid:54) 5 nm ( n (cid:53) 11 ) . The pattern of decoration was irregu - lar for most filaments observed ( Fig . 12 B ) but occasion - ally had a periodicity of (cid:122) 36 nm or one - half the pitch of the two - start helix in the actin filament structure . To determine which subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex me - diate binding to actin filaments , we cross - linked Arp2 / 3 complex to Acanthamoeba actin filaments with the zero - length chemical cross - linker EDC . We cross - linked Arp2 / 3 complex alone , actin filaments alone , and a mixture of Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments . In the Arp2 / 3 and ac - tin mixture , monoclonal antiactin antibodies recognized several new bands not present when actin was cross - linked alone . Three prominent new bands at 93 , 79 , and 59 kD ( Fig . 13 A ) appeared to be actin monomers cross - linked to single subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Antibodies against Arp3 also recognized a 93 - kD band not present when Arp2 / 3 complex was cross - linked in the absence of actin ( Fig . 13 B , lanes 3 – 5 ) , and antibodies against p35 recog - nized a 79 - kD band not present when Arp2 / 3 complex alone was cross - linked ( Fig . 13 B , lanes 1 – 3 ) . These results indicate a direct association between Arp3 and actin and between p35 and actin . The actin - containing , cross - linked band at 59 kD is not recognized by monospecific antibod - ies against Arp3 , Arp2 , p40 , or p35 , indicating that it is an actin monomer cross - linked to one of the small molecular weight subunits of the complex , p19 , p18 , or p14 . Interaction of Arp2 / 3 Complex with Profilin The Arp2 / 3 complex has previously been shown to bind immobilized profilin ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) . The binding , however , appears to be rather weak . Profilin does not coimmunoprecipitate out of cell extracts with any of the four monospecific complex antibodies ( data not shown ) . The amine - reactive cross - linkers DST and DSG , under conditions in which they cross - linked actin to profilin , did not cross - link profilin to any complex subunit ( data not shown ) . In addition , profilin added to mixtures of actin fil - aments , and Arp2 / 3 complex did not measurably copellet under a 30 - min spin at 200 , 000 g nor did it inhibit copellet - ing of Arp2 / 3 complex ( data not shown ) . Fluorescence anisotropy experiments with rhodamine - labeled Acan - thamoeba profilin - II suggest that the affinity of Arp2 / 3 complex for profilin is in the low micromolar range ( Kelle - her , J . F . , R . D . Mullins , V . K . Vinson , and T . D . Pollard , manuscript in preparation ) . Discussion Subunit Composition of the Arp2 / 3 Complex Machesky et al . ( 1994 ) originally purified four proteins— Arp3 , Arp2 , p40 , and p35—by profilin affinity chromatog - raphy . Purification by conventional ion exchange chroma - tography , using anti - Arp3 antibodies as an assay , yielded the same set of proteins along with three additional polypeptides , p19 , p18 , and p14 . Affinity chromatography on poly - l - proline yielded the original four proteins and variable amounts of p19 and p14 . The present study shows that affinity chromatography on poly - l - proline can be used to purify all seven polypeptides . The two Arps , p40 , p35 , and p14 are present in equimolar ratios judging from Coo - massie blue – stained gels . The stoichiometries of p19 and p18 are less certain . The staining of p19 is consistently lighter than p18 so either ( a ) p19 does not run at its true molecular weight on SDS - PAGE , ( b ) p19 does not bind dye at the ratio of other complex members , or ( c ) p19 is not present at 1 : 1 stoichiometry . The fact that p19 is never absent from a preparation of Arp2 / 3 complex and that the Figure 11 . Pelleting of Arp2 / 3 complex with actin filaments . Con - ditions : 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imida - zole , pH 7 . 0 . A stock solution of 25 (cid:109) M polymerized actin was di - luted to various concentrations with 0 . 25 (cid:109) M purified Arp2 / 3 complex . After 15 min at room temperature , we centrifuged the samples for 30 min at 24 (cid:56) C in a TLA 100 rotor at 200 , 000 g . Su - pernatants were analyzed by SDS - PAGE for depletion of com - plex subunits . Coomassie brilliant blue – stained gels were digi - tized with a Microtek ScanMaker III flat - bed scanner , and densities of gel bands were integrated by computer . Data shown are for depletion of p18 (cid:49) p19 and were fit to a rectangular hyper - bola yielding an apparent K d of 2 . 3 (cid:54) 0 . 3 (cid:109) M ( R 2 (cid:53) 0 . 975 ) . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 136 , 1997 340 complex runs as a sharp , symmetrical peak on gel filtration columns argues against c and indicates that p19 is indeed present at 1 : 1 stoichiometry . Hydrodynamic Properties of the Arp2 / 3 Complex The Arp2 / 3 complex , purified by affinity chromatography on poly - l - proline , sediments as a homogeneous particle at 8 . 7 S and runs as a single peak at 5 . 3 - nm Stokes’ radius on calibrated gel filtration columns . The molecular mass de - termined by analytical ultracentrifugation is 197 kD , con - sistent with the presence of no more than one copy each of the seven polypeptides in the complex . The sedimentation coefficient is constant over a large concentration range , but at low concentration ( (cid:60) 70 nM ) , the distribution of the sedimentation coefficients broadens and its peak shifts to lower values . We interpret this shift as a partial dissocia - tion of the complex and estimate that the K d of the most weakly bound subunit ( s ) of the complex is on the order of 70 nM . The cytoplasmic concentrations of Arp2 and Arp3 are (cid:62) 2 (cid:109) M ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Kelleher et al . , 1995 ) , so the particle should be stable in the cytoplasm . Hydrodynamic data indicate that the Arp2 / 3 complex is not spherical . Two models are typically used to approxi - mate nonspherical particles in hydrodynamic studies : a ci - gar - shaped , prolate ellipsoid of revolution and a disc - shaped , oblate ellipsoid of revolution . Our physical data are consistent with either a prolate ellipsoid of revolution with an axial ratio of 4 : 1 , maximum length of 19 . 5 nm , and diameter 4 . 9 nm , or an oblate ellipsoid of revolution with an axial ratio of 1 : 4 . 3 , thickness of 2 . 9 nm , and diameter of 12 . 6 nm . Electron microscopy rules out an elongated mor - phology for the complex and suggests a more compact , horseshoe shape with outer dimensions approximating the diameter of the oblate ellipsoid model . To determine if such a shape is consistent with our physical characterization of the Arp2 / 3 complex , we con - structed hydrodynamic models of various shapes and calculated their sedimentation coefficients ( Fig . 14 ) . The models all consisted of five identical , rigidly coupled spheres 4 . 52 nm in diameter . A partial specific volume of 0 . 74 cm 3 / gm gives each model a molecular mass of 197 kD . Using a hy - dration value of 0 . 323 g / g , calculated from amino acid analysis ( see Materials and Methods ) , we calculated fric - tional and sedimentation coefficients according to the method of Riseman and Kirkwood ( 1956 ) . We considered four general models ( Fig . 14 ) : ( a ) a globular , double - tetra - hedral arrangement ; ( b ) an extended linear model ; ( c ) a planar , open horseshoe structure ; and ( d ) a tightly closed , horseshoe arrangement . The calculated sedimentation coefficients of the globu - lar and extended models were significantly higher ( 10 . 3 S ) and lower ( 8 . 1 S ) , respectively , than the values measured for the Arp2 / 3 complex . Of the four models , we obtained best agreement with our experimental data from the open horseshoe structure ( Fig . 14 C ) . This arrangement is pla - nar and symmetric and can be defined by two angles : (cid:97) , the angle that a line from the center of the middle sphere to the center of an adjacent sphere makes with the hori - zontal , and (cid:98) , the angle that a line from the center of an outermost sphere to the center of the adjacent sphere makes with the horizontal ( see angles illustrated in Fig . 14 , C and D ) . To obtain a general horseshoe shape , we re - quire that (cid:97) (cid:60) (cid:98) (cid:60) 90 (cid:56) . We determined all combinations of (cid:97) and (cid:98) , within these constraints , that give our model ex - act agreement with measured hydrodynamic data . The limiting cases of these models are (cid:97) (cid:53) 30 (cid:56) , (cid:98) (cid:53) 90 (cid:56) and (cid:97) (cid:53) 54 (cid:56) , (cid:98) (cid:53) 54 (cid:56) . In the example shown in Fig . 14 C , (cid:97) (cid:53) 45 (cid:56) , (cid:98) (cid:53) 76 (cid:56) , and the model’s outer dimensions are 12 (cid:51) 13 nm . This structure is slightly more splayed than most of the Figure 12 . Electron micrographs of single , negatively stained actin filaments in the absence ( A ) and presence ( B ) of Arp2 / 3 complex . Conditions : 20 (cid:109) M actin was polymerized at 24 (cid:56) C for 30 min in 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , and then diluted to 0 . 3 (cid:109) M in the same buffer or buffer containing 2 . 3 (cid:109) M Arp2 / 3 complex . Lightly glow - discharged , carbon - coated grids were incubated on a drop of this solution and then stained with 1 % uranyl formate according to the method of Aebi and Pollard ( 1987 ) . The diameter of actin filaments decorated with Arp2 / 3 complex is 24 (cid:54) 3 nm ( n (cid:53) 15 ) , compared to 7 . 5 (cid:54) 0 . 8 nm ( n (cid:53) 15 ) for actin filaments alone . Mullins et al . Arp2 / 3 Complex 341 Arp2 / 3 complex molecules we observed but agrees with the approximate shape and dimensions determined from electron microscopy . The models used in our calculations were based on the hydrodynamic properties of ideal spheres , but irregularities in the surfaces of proteins ( rugosity ) con - tribute to hydrodynamic drag and reduce the sedimenta - tion coefficient . Including a contribution from rugosity in our hydrodynamic calculations would make a more tightly closed horseshoe model , with morphology somewhere be - tween the models of Fig . 14 , C and D , consistent with the measured sedimentation coefficient . Subunit Topology Chemical cross - linking produced seven heterodimers of Arp2 / 3 complex subunits . Based on these cross - links , we Figure 13 .

Models assume five rigidly linked , identical 4 . 52 - nm - diam spheres , each with a partial specific volume of 0 . 74 cm 3 / gm . Each model , thus , has a molecular mass of 197 kD .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 136 , 1997 342 propose a nearest - neighbor subunit topology ( Fig . 15 ) . The four largest molecular weight subunits , Arp3 , Arp2 , p40 , and p35 , are in close proximity . Zero - length cross - links can be made between Arp3 and p35 , p35 and p40 , and Arp2 and p40 . In addition , a 0 . 64 - nm cross - link can be made between p35 and Arp2 , suggesting a relatively com - pact arrangement of these subunits ( Fig . 15 ) . Based on electron microscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation , this arrangement appears to be roughly planar . Cross - linking identified p40 as an Arp2 - binding protein and p35 as an Arp3 - binding protein . The fact that p35 can be cross - linked to both Arps and to p40 suggests that it may function to stabilize or spatially organize the complex . Previous studies have focused on the possibility that Arp2 and Arp3 form a heterodimer analogous to two actin monomers within a filament . We did not find a direct in - teraction between the two actin related proteins , but the fact that p35 can be cross - linked to each indicates that they may be in close proximity . Arp2 is efficiently cross - linked to p40 by the sulfhydryl - reactive cross - linker BMH as well as by EDC / NHS . The BMH cross - link is quite specific since Arp2 and Arp3 each have eight cysteine residues in similar positions , but BMH - cross - links p40 only to Arp2 . Structural models of Arp2 ( Kelleher et al . , 1995 ) based on the crystal structure of ac - tin ( Kabsch et al . , 1985 ) suggest that only three cysteines are available for cross - linking at the surface of the mole - cule , cys103 , cys340 , and cys387 . Model structures place cys103 and cys387 in a region corresponding to subdomain 1 and cys340 in a region corresponding to subdomain 3 of an actin monomer . All three residues are on the front surface in the standard view of the actin monomer ( Kabsch et al . , 1985 ) . Therefore , p40 faces the surface of Arp2 that corre - sponds to the surface of an actin monomer exposed on the outside of an actin filament . The relative positions of the three smallest molecular weight subunits are more ambiguous . We can cross - link p19 to p14 and we can cross - link two of the three low mo - lecular weight subunits to Arp3 . Based on apparent molec - ular weights , we believe these subunits are p18 and p19 . Fig . 15 illustrates our favored arrangement of p18 , p19 , and p14 within the complex . Actin Interaction Here we present the first evidence of direct interaction be - tween the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments . Biochemi - cal and electron microscopic experiments reveal that the Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the sides of actin filaments with micromolar affinity . In Acanthamoeba cells , the cytoplas - mic concentration of filamentous actin is 100 (cid:109) M ( Pollard and Cooper , 1986 ) and that of Arp2 / 3 complex is 2 (cid:109) M ( Kelleher et al . , 1995 ) . From these values and the mea - sured K d of 2 . 3 (cid:109) M , we estimate that 98 % of the complex in Acanthamoeba cells is bound to actin filaments . By im - munofluorescence , the complex localizes preferentially to regions of the cell with high actin filament concentration ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Kelleher et al . , 1995 and this study ) . We also find that both p35 and p40 localize to actin fila - ment fibrils in the cell periphery and to microspikes pro - jecting from the cell surface . The morphology of the leading edge of motile Acan - thamoeba cells is similar to locomoting tissue culture cells that extend a lamellapod , an actin - rich extension of the cell cortex , devoid of cytoplasmic organelles , in which the majority of actin filaments are oriented with their barbed ends facing the cell membrane ( Oliver et al . , 1978 ; Small et al . , 1978 ) . At the trailing edges of locomoting cells , or - ganelles and vesicles approach more closely to the plasma membrane . Based on these morphological criteria , the cells in Fig . 10 , C and F , appear to be moving toward the upper left hand corners of the micrographs . The staining pattern of p40 in both cells is consistent with a localization to actin bundles in the advancing edge of the cell . Further work is required to determine if Arp2 / 3 complex is directly involved in the process of cell locomotion or lamellapod extension . Three subunits of the complex—Arp3 , p35 , and either p19 , p18 , or p14—were found , by chemical cross - linking , to be closely associated with actin . Sequence analysis of Arp3 suggests that it cannot copolymerize with actin , but that both Arp3 and Arp2 conserve homology to regions of actin that are exposed at the barbed ends of actin fila - ments . Based on this observation , Kelleher et al . ( 1995 ) suggested that Arp2 and Arp3 might form a heterodimer , containing a structural motif similar to the barbed end of an actin filament . Such a structure might regulate actin po - lymerization in vivo by forming a cryptic nucleus for fila - ment formation . At present , our biochemical data do not support this type of activity for the purified complex , but it is possible that this activity , if it exists , requires posttrans - lational modifications , a cofactor , or a second messenger . Further experiments are required to address this hypothesis . Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the sides of actin filaments . The fact that three subunits of the complex interact with actin suggests that the complex makes multiple contacts with a single filament and / or it cross - links filaments into networks or bundles . Work in progress indicates that the complex organizes actin filaments into bundles in vitro ( Kelleher , J . F . , R . D . Mullins , V . K . Vinson , and T . D . Pol - lard , manuscript in preparation ) , much like the linear structures that we observe in the cortex of fixed cells . Arp2 / 3 complex – decorated actin filaments have a diam - eter of 24 nm , so Arp2 / 3 complex molecules project a max - imum distance of 7 nm from the filament surface . The larg - est dimension of the complex is (cid:122) 13 nm . Therefore , the long axis of the complex must be inclined to within 33 (cid:56) of the filament axis . Also , decoration of actin filaments does not appear as a regular , repeating pattern . This irregular - Figure 15 . Chemical cross - linking model of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Lines represent chemical cross - links made between subunits with vari - ous cross - linkers . Line lengths are proportional to cross - linker spacer arms and subunit sizes are propor - tional to apparent molecular weights . Both subunits de - noted with a * and one of the three subunits denoted with a (cid:49) can be cross - linked to ac - tin by EDC / NHS . Mullins et al . Arp2 / 3 Complex 343 ity may be caused by incomplete occupation of Arp2 / 3 - binding sites at the concentrations used for electron mi - croscopy or by the presence of multiple actin - binding sites within the complex , each binding with a unique orienta - tion . The function of the Arp2 / 3 complex in living cells is still a mystery , but its interaction with profilin , direct binding to actin filaments , and localization to actin filament fibrils in the cell cortex suggest that it plays a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton .
