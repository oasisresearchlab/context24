Traditional antiviral drugs against HSV - 1 are limited to nucleoside analogs targeting viral factors . Inhibition of heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) has potent anti - HSV - 1 activities via numerous mechanisms , but the effects of Hsp90 inhibitors on HSV - 1 infection in neuronal cells , especially in the phase of virus entry , are still unknown . In this study , we aimed to investigate the effects of the Hsp90 inhibitors on HSV - 1 infection of neuronal cells . Interestingly , we found that Hsp90 inhibitors promoted viral adsorption but inhibited subsequent penetration in neuronal cell lines and primary neurons , which jointly confers the antiviral activity of the Hsp90 inhibitors . Mechanically , Hsp90 inhibitors mainly impaired the interaction between Hsp90 and coﬁlin , resulting in reduced coﬁlin membrane distribution , which led to F - actin polymerization to promote viral attachment . However , excessive polymerization of F - actin inhibited subsequent viral penetration . Consequently , unidirectional F - actin polymerization limits the entry of HSV - 1 virions into neuron cells . Our research extended the molecular mechanism of Hsp90 in HSV - 1 infection in neuron cells and provided a theoretical basis for developing antiviral drugs targeting Hsp90 . Keywords : herpes simplex virus 1 , heat shock protein 90 , virus entry , coﬁlin , F - actin INTRODUCTION Herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV - 1 ) is a neurotropic DNA virus belonging to the Herpesviridae family ( Grinde , 2013 ) . The infection of HSV - 1 is extensive and causes disease diversity . In particular , HSV - 1 , as a neurotropic virus , spreads to the brain . After primary infection , HSV - 1 can reach the central nervous system , resulting in substantial damage to neuronal cells ( Wang et al . , 2019 ; Marcocci et al . , 2020 ) . Herpes simplex encephalitis ( HSE ) induced by HSV - 1 infection is the most common sporadic but fatal encephalitis . Although rare , HSE causes 70 % mortality in Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 1 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 799890 fmicb - 12 - 799890 January 4 , 2022 Time : 13 : 19 # 2 Song et al . Hsp90’s Role in HSV - 1 Entry untreated patients ( Whitley , 2006 ; Stahl et al . , 2012 ; Piret and Boivin , 2020 ) , and most survivors present severe neurological sequelae ( Lafaille et al . , 2019 ) . Further research indicates that HSV - 1 infection of neurons activates neurotoxic pathways typical of Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) , and repeated HSV - 1 reactivations in the brain of infected mice produce an AD - like phenotype . HSV - 1 is gradually recognized as an important factor aﬀecting AD development ( Balin and Hudson , 2018 ; Eimer et al . , 2018 ; Tzeng et al . , 2018 ; Wang et al . , 2020b ) . The proliferation process of HSV - 1 includes multiple stages ( Ibáñez et al . , 2018 ) . Traditional antiviral drugs against HSV - 1 are limited to nucleoside analogs targeting viral factors , and the treatment drugs are single ; thus , novel therapeutic targets against HSV - 1 infection - associated diseases are urgently needed ( Wang et al . , 2017 ) . Virus propagation requires host proteins to participate ; to ﬁnd new antiviral targets from host proteins is an appropriate strategy for developing safe and eﬀective anti - herpes simplex drugs ( Wang et al . , 2017 ) . The heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) as a molecular chaperone associates with various other proteins such as steroid receptors , protein kinases , and ﬁlamentous actin and activates or inhibits a range of client proteins ( Buchner and Li , 2013 ; Schopf et al . , 2017 ) . Hsp90 is essential for many viruses to complete the multiplication cycle , including human immunodeﬁciency virus ( HIV ) - 1 , enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) , HSV - 1 , and inﬂuenza virus ( Wang et al . , 2017 ) . Recent studies have indicated that Hsp90 is a crucial host factor that is required by many viruses for multiple phases of their life cycle , such as virus entry and intracellular transport , viral gene expression , and viral protein maturation which requires Hsp90 regulation ( Wang et al . , 2017 ; Li et al . , 2018 ) . Hsp90 has attracted intensive attention in developing novel antiviral drugs because of their functions in the life cycle of multiple viruses . For example , Hsp90 inhibitors block HSV - 1 nuclear egress and assembly in Vero cells ( Ju et al . , 2011 ; Xiang et al . , 2012a ; Li et al . , 2018 ) , and another research shows that Hsp90 is essential for the correct localization of HSV - 1 DNA polymerase to the nucleus ( Burch and Weller , 2005 ) , and Hsp90 also promotes nuclear transport of HSV - 1 capsid proteins by interacting with acetylated tubulin ( Zhong et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , previous research showed that AT533 reduced the nuclear translocation of NF - κ B and NLRP3 activation via inhibiting Hsp90 from attenuating HSV - 1 - induced inﬂammation ( Li et al . , 2019b ) . Hsp90 inhibitors have rarely reported their antiviral eﬀects in neurons , and it is of great signiﬁcance to study Hsp90 as a promising host target for antiviral infection in neurons . Viral intracellular transportation mainly relies on the dynamic regulation of the cell’s cytoskeleton , especially actin ﬁlaments , an important part of the cell cytoskeleton , which is closely related to early virus infection ( Xiang et al . , 2012b ) . Actin ﬁlaments are polymers formed by G - actin polymerization , mainly in the cortical area below the cell membrane ( Sens and Plastino , 2015 ) ; F - actin dynamics is essential for early virus infection ( Xiang et al . , 2012b ) . Rho GTPase is a key regulator for regulating the actin dynamics , which is also closely related to viral infections ( Favoreel et al . , 2007 ; Van den Broeke et al . , 2014 ) . For example , the actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin regulates the microﬁlament framework ( Favoreel et al . , 2007 ; Ndozangue - Touriguine et al . , 2008 ) . Coﬁlin is essential for regulators of actin dynamics , is previously reported to sever actin ﬁlaments at low coﬁlin / actin ratios , and stabilizes ﬁlaments at high coﬁlin / actin ratios in mammalian neurons by binding to ADP – actin subunits in F - actin ( Southwick , 2000 ; Bravo - Cordero et al . , 2013 ; Wioland et al . , 2017 ) . When various intracellular and extracellular signal molecules stimulate cells , the microﬁlament can form ﬁlopodia , lamellipodia , and stress ﬁbers ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . As an essential facet of virus – cell interactions , HSV interacts with the host cytoskeleton at various stages of the viral life cycle . The biphasic F - actin dynamics in HSV - 1 neurons was demonstrated ( Xiang et al . , 2012b ; Zheng et al . , 2016 ) . For example , F - actin dynamics plays a vital role in virus entry ; we have shown that early infection of HSV - 1 mobilizes F - actin reorganization to facilitate viral entry ( Xiang et al . , 2012b ) . F - Actin is polymerized to form pseudopods , which enrich the receptors required by the virus and facilitate further infection of the virus ( Hu et al . , 2016 ; Azab and Osterrieder , 2017 ) , and previous studies have shown that the viral envelope glycoprotein gB binds to the receptor α 3 β 1 , activates Rho GTPases to cause the rearrangement of F - actin , and ultimately promotes virus entry into the cell ( Naranatt et al . , 2003 ) . The entry of the virus into host cells , including adsorption and penetration , is the initial step of the infection process and is an ideal antiviral stage ( Ibáñez et al . , 2018 ) . It is a good antiviral strategy to block the assembly of G - actin by regulating the polymerization and depolymerization of F - actin to inhibit virus entry ( Zheng et al . , 2016 ) . Hsp90 is associated with ﬁlamentous actin ( Kellermayer and Csermely , 1995 ; Taiyab and Rao , 2011 ) , but the speciﬁc mechanism of Hsp90 regulating ﬁlamentous actin remains to be further explored . Herein , we further investigated the antiviral eﬃcacy and mechanism of Hsp90 inhibitors in neuron cells and provided a theoretical basis for Hsp90 as a new anti - HSV - 1 drug target point in HSE .

Both SH - SY5Y and N2a cells were seeded into 96 - well plates to 90 % conﬂuence ; then , various concentrations of the compound were added to the plate . After 24 h , each well was added with 10 µ l of CCK8 solution and incubated at 37 ◦ C for another 2 h in the dark . The absorbance was then measured by an enzyme immunoassay reader at 450 nm .

Subsequently , samples were subjected to 10 – 12 % SDS - PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene ﬂuoride ( PVDF ) membrane ( Millipore , Bedford , MA , United States ) . The PVDF membranes were incubated with interesting primary antibodies overnight at 4 ◦ C after blocking with 5 % skimmed milk for 1 h , then indicated with appropriate HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , United States ) for 1 h at room temperature . Finally , target proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence . Detection of Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Binding and Internalization The amount of virus binding to and internalized by cells was measured as described previously , just with minor modiﬁcations ( Wang et al . , 2020a ) . Cells were seeded 24 h prior to the experiment in 12 - well plates at a 2 × 105 / well density to determine the amount of virus binding . Cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 ◦ C , then infected with HSV - 1 for another 1 h in the presence of 17 - AAG or AT533 . The unbound virus was removed with PBS after HSV - 1 attachment .

To measure the amount of viral entry , cells were seeded 24 h prior to the experiment in 12 - well plates at a 2 × 10 5 / well density . Cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 ◦ C , then infected with HSV - 1 for another 1 h , and then washed with PBS for three times before the cells were transferred to 37 ◦ C until the end of penetration ; the HSV - 1 internalized by cells was detected after extracellular viral particles and virions that bound to but did not enter the cells were removed by washing with PBS ( pH 3 . 0 ) . The cells were collected , and total DNA was extracted by EasyPure Viral DNA / RNA Kit , and targeted genes were analyzed by qRT - PCR . In addition , other experiments were performed on these cell samples according to the experimental objectives . Viral Plaque Assay SH - SY5Y and Vero cells were seeded in 24 - well plates at a density of 1 . 5 × 105 / well , then the reduction of plaque formation was measured .

Hsp90’s Role in HSV - 1 Entry Immunoprecipitation Assay Cells were lysed with 500 µ l IP lysis buﬀer ( P0013J , Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) containing 1 % PMSF , and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 14 , 000 g for 10 min at 4 ◦ C . Fifty microliters of supernatant was used as input , and the remaining supernatant was incubated with a primary antibody ( Hsp90 , coﬁlin ) overnight at 4 ◦ C . Then , 40 µ l of Protein A / G magnetic beads were incubated for 4 h on a vertical suspension at 4 ◦ C . The immunoprecipitation was collected and washed three times with ice PBS and resuspended in 30 µ l of 1 × SDS - PAGE buﬀer . Finally , the sample was analyzed by Western blot . Flow Cytometry Cells were infected with HSV - 1 and treated with 17 - AAG , AT533 , or cytochalasin B , and the samples were processed accordingly according to the purpose of the experiment . Then , the cells were washed with PBS , ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 5 min , and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min . Next , all samples were stained with 5 % FITC phalloidin ( 40735ES75 , YEASEN , China ) for 40 min at 37 ◦ C . Finally , ﬂuorescence was analyzed with a ﬂow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA , United States ) . Primary Cortical Neuron Extraction The extraction of cortical neurons was measured as described previously ( Meng et al . , 2017 ) . We extracted cortical neurons from C57BL / 6J mice 1 – 2 days after birth . For example , 0 . 1 mg / ml L - polylysine ( P8130 - 25 , Solarbio , Beijing , China ) was coated on a six - well plate overnight , washed with ultrapure water , and exposed to ultraviolet light in a biological safety cabinet and dried . C57BL / 6J mice were sterilized with 75 % alcohol , and the cerebral cortex was taken out and cut into pieces in a container of 2 ml D - Hanks solution , then 1 ml of 0 . 25 % trypsin was added for digestion at 37 ◦ C , 5 % CO 2 for 10 min . The tissue suspension was ﬁltered with a primary cell strainer , and the cells were collected at 1 , 000 rpm , centrifuged for 5 min , and seeded in a six - well plate at 1 . 5 × 10 6 cells / well . Finally , the cells were cultured in a 37 ◦ C , 5 % CO 2 incubator for 6 h , and then the adhesion of the cells was observed . After most of the cells have adhered , the medium was changed and a freshly prepared Neurobasal - A + B27 medium was added . The second day of replacing the Neurobasal - A + B27 medium was used as the ﬁrst day of in vitro cell culture . On the third day , the Neurobasal - A + B27 medium was changed again . On the ﬁfth day , neurons were separated and subjected to corresponding experiments . Statistical Analysis Data were presented as mean ± SD of the results from at least two independent experiments .

RESULTS Hsp90 Inhibitors Inhibit Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Infection of Neuron Cells Two diﬀerent Hsp90 inhibitors , 17 - AAG and AT533 , were used to detect cytotoxicity and antiviral activity . Firstly , the cytotoxicity FIGURE 1 | The antiviral activity of Hsp90 inhibitors . ( A , B ) Hsp90 inhibitors exhibited an inhibitory effect on eGFP - HSV - 1 . SH - SY5Y and N2a cells were infected with eGFP - HSV - 1 ( MOI = 0 . 1 ) at different concentrations of 17 - AAG or AT533 for 24 h . The ﬂuorescence intensity was detected by a multifunctional enzyme marking instrument to calculate the virus inhibition rate .

Hsp90’s Role in HSV - 1 Entry of Hsp90 inhibitors on SH - SY5Y and N2a cells was detected by CCK8 assay ( Supplementary Figures 1A , B ) . In addition , we used eGFP - HSV - 1 to infect SH - SY5Y and N2a cells for 24 h in the presence of Hsp90 inhibitors , respectively , and the antiviral activity of Hsp90 inhibitors was judged by the ﬂuorescence intensity of eGFP ( Figures 1A , B ) . Furthermore , we also assessed the eﬀects of Hsp90 inhibitors on viral titers ( Figure 1C ) , which indicated that 17 - AAG and AT533 inhibited HSV - 1 infection . HSV - 1 DNA was also extracted by the Virus DNA / RNA Kit to detect the amount of HSV - 1 . The results show that 17 - AAG and AT533 have better antiviral activity than ACV ( Acyclovir ) ( Figure 1D ) . Hsp90 Inhibitors Promote Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Attachment We consider that the adsorption of HSV - 1 on the cell membrane surface is the ﬁrst step in the virus proliferation process ( Ibáñez et al . , 2018 ) . To explore the eﬀect of Hsp90 inhibitors on the adsorption phase of HSV - 1 - infected neuron cells , two diﬀerent Hsp90 inhibitors , 17 - AAG and AT533 , were treated as neuron cells . A simple diagram of HSV - 1 attachment was shown ( Supplementary Figure 2A ) . We ﬁrstly investigated the amount of HSV - 1 bound to cells by quantifying the viral genome , a common method used for determining the amount of viral attachment during early infection ( Wang et al . , 2020a ) . Neuron cells are pretreated at 4 ◦ C for 1 h and then infected with HSV - 1 1 h at 4 ◦ C , so that the virus can be infected simultaneously as much as possible , after the adsorption is completed . Hsp90 inhibitors were treated on the adsorption of HSV - 1 - infected SH - SY5Y and N2a cells , then HSV - 1 DNA was extracted by the Virus DNA / RNA Kit for detection by qRT - PCR . Interestingly , the results indicated that viral attachment was higher than control groups after Hsp90 inhibitors treatment ( Figures 2A , C ) . Similarly , Hsp90 inhibitors pretreatment also promoted HSV - 1 attachment ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . The FIGURE 2 | Hsp90 inhibitors promote HSV - 1 attachment . ( A ) Hsp90 inhibitors increased the amount of viral DNA . SH - SY5Y cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 ◦ C , then infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 20 ) for another 1 h in the presence of 17 - AAG or AT533 , and the unbound virus was removed after HSV - 1 attachment . Total DNA of HSV - 1 was extracted , and the expression level of UL47 and UL49 was subjected to qRT - PCR analysis . ( B ) Hsp90 inhibitors increased the amount of viral protein . SH - SY5Y cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 ◦ C , then infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 50 ) for another 1 h in the presence of 17 - AAG or AT533 , and the unbound virus was removed after HSV - 1 attachment . The level of gB was detected by Western blot . ( C , D ) N2a cells were treated as ( A , B ) in the presence of Hsp90 inhibitors , and the total DNA and protein of HSV - 1 were extracted for analysis . ( E ) Hsp90 inhibitors promoted the amount of viral DNA in primary cortical neurons . Primary cortical neurons were incubated for 1 h at 4 ◦ C , then infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 20 ) for another 1 h in the presence of 17 - AAG or AT533 , then viral DNA was extracted and then qRT - PCR was performed to measure viral DNA amounts . ( F ) 17 - AAG promoted the amount of protein . Primary cortical neurons were incubated for 1 h at 4 ◦ C , then infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 50 ) for another 1 h in the presence of 17 - AAG or AT533 , the total proteins were extracted after HSV - 1 attachment ; protein levels were evaluated by Western blotting . ( G ) The efﬁciency of Hsp90 α and Hsp90 β knockdown was detected by Western blot for 48 h . ( H ) Hsp90 α and Hsp90 β knockdown also increased the level of HSV - 1 . Data are mean ± SD ( n = 3 ) . * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 versus the HSV - 1 control group . Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 5 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 799890 fmicb - 12 - 799890 January 4 , 2022 Time : 13 : 19 # 6 Song et al . Hsp90’s Role in HSV - 1 Entry level of gB , a viral protein carried by the virus particle itself , was increased than the virus control after the cells were treated with Hsp90 inhibitors ( Figures 2B , D ) . Consistently , we also veriﬁed primary cortical neurons , and the cortical neurons of C57BL / 6J mice were extracted as described previously ( Meng et al . , 2017 ) . Cell morphology was shown ( Supplementary Figure 4A ) , beyond the neuronal nuclear antigen ( NeuN ) , a neuronal speciﬁc nuclear protein in vertebrates , as a neuronal nuclear antigen marker was detected , and the primary cortical neurons were separated with a purity of 95 . 76 % ( Supplementary Figure 4B ) . The DNA and protein levels were higher than the control group ( Figures 2E , F ) . These results conﬁrmed that Hsp90 inhibitors facilitated the adsorption of HSV - 1 on neuron cells . Hsp90 α and Hsp90 β are mainly involved in the virus proliferation cycle ( Wang et al . , 2017 ) . Moreover , the knockdown eﬃciency was detected after Hsp90 α and Hsp90 β were knocked down by siRNA ( Figure 2G ) . Samples were collected to extract viral DNA to determine the HSV - 1 binding amount according to the “Detection of HSV - 1 binding and internalization” method , and Hsp90 α and Hsp90 β knockdown promoted viral attachment ( Figure 2H ) . Hsp90 Inhibitors Inhibit Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Penetration Furthermore , Hsp90 is involved in multiple phases of the virus infection cycle ( Wang et al . , 2017 ) . Thus , we further explored the eﬀect of Hsp90 inhibitors on HSV - 1 penetration , and a simple diagram of HSV - 1 penetration was shown ( Supplementary Figure 2B ) . The dynamic curve of HSV - 1 penetration was tested ( Supplementary Figures 5A , B ) . Firstly , neuronal cells were infected with HSV - 1 for 1 h at 4 ◦ C ; we found that FIGURE 3 | Hsp90 inhibitors abrogate HSV - 1 penetration . ( A , B ) 17 - AAG and AT533 reduced the amount of viral DNA . SH - SY5Y and N2a cells were precooled for 1 h at 4 ◦ C , then infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 20 ) for another 1 h at 4 ◦ C .

Hsp90’s Role in HSV - 1 Entry the intracellular virus reached a plateau after 30 min of virus infection at 37 ◦ C , indicating the end of viral penetration . To further conﬁrm the eﬀects of Hsp90 inhibitors on HSV - 1 early infection , the internalized viral DNA was quantiﬁed using real - time PCR . As shown in Figures 3A , B , Hsp90 inhibitors inhibit the amount of intracellular virus DNA . Antiviral activity was evaluated by a plaque reduction assay ( PRA ) ; the amount of HSV - 1 infection - mediated plaque formation units was also signiﬁcantly reduced by Hsp90 inhibitors ( Figure 3C ) . Therefore , the above experiment indicates that Hsp90 inhibitors inhibit virus penetration . Hsp90 Inhibitors Inhibit Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Entry Considering that the process of virus entry into host cells includes adsorption and penetration stages , the comprehensive eﬀect of Hsp90 inhibitors on HSV - 1 entry into neuron cells is worthy of further investigation . HSV - 1 DNA was extracted using the viral DNA / RNA kit and detected by qRT - PCR . As shown in Figure 4A , whether it was pretreated and treated with 17 - AAG or AT533 , the entry of HSV - 1 was inhibited . In addition , plaque reduction experiments also show that Hsp90 inhibitors impaired HSV - 1 from entering SH - SY5Y cells ( Figure 4B ) . While it is not suitable for N2a cells to directly form plaque , after HSV - 1 ( MOI = 20 ) infected N2a cells , the virus was therefore collected to infect Vero cells for plaque reduction experiments ; consistently , Hsp90 inhibitor treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the number of viral plaque ( Figure 4C ) . These results further demonstrated that Hsp90 inhibitors played an antiviral eﬀect at HSV - 1 entry . Hsp90 Inhibitors Induce F - Actin Assembly Cell cytoskeleton , especially actin ﬁlaments , is an essential part of the cell structure , closely related to virus infection ( Favoreel et al . , 2007 ; Pollard and Cooper , 2009 ; Zheng et al . , 2016 ; Miranda - Saksena et al . , 2018 ) . In the previous study , F - actin FIGURE 5 | Hsp90 inhibitors promote the aggregation of F - actin . ( A ) Hsp90 inhibitors induced F - actin assembly in HSV - 1 entry .

Hsp90’s Role in HSV - 1 Entry dynamics plays a vital role in virus entry . We have shown that early infection of HSV - 1 mobilizes F - actin reorganization to facilitate viral entry ( Xiang et al . , 2012b ) . Considering that HSV - 1 modiﬁes the actin ﬁlaments via coﬁlin to facilitate its infection of neurons , speciﬁcally , HSV - 1 infection ﬁrstly enhances F - actin polymerization to promote virus binding , which is followed by continuous depolymerization of F - actin during the later stages to facilitate viral penetration ( Xiang et al . , 2012b ; Zheng et al . , 2014 ) . It has been reported that disrupting the dynamics of F - actin is a good antiviral strategy . For example , amentoﬂavone , a polyphenol compound , disturbed coﬁlin - mediated F - actin assembly and signiﬁcantly reduced HSV - 1 infection ( Li et al . , 2019a ) . In addition , the disruption of F - actin dynamics by chemical inhibitors also signiﬁcantly reduced the eﬃciency of early viral infection and intracellular HSV - 1 replication ( Pei et al . , 2011 ; Xiang et al . , 2012b ; Spear et al . , 2013 ; Yi et al . , 2017 ) . Thus , we ﬁrstly analyzed the possible eﬀect of Hsp90 inhibitors on the F - actin of neuronal cells ; cytochalasin B ( Cyto B ) , an inhibitor of F - actin , was used to induce the depolymerization of existing actin ﬁlaments , and the results indicated that Hsp90 inhibitors promoted the polymerization of F - actin to prevent Cyto B - induced depolymerization with HSV - 1 infection ( Figure 5A ) . Next , F - actin was measured by ﬂow cytometry as described previously ( Li et al . , 2019a ) . As shown in Figure 5B , Hsp90 inhibitors induced F - actin assembly in the presence of HSV - 1 infection . Finally , the eﬀect of Hsp90 inhibitors on F - actin with the stages of HSV - 1 penetration was also analyzed ( Figure 5C ) . These results indicated that Hsp90 inhibitors promoted F - actin polymerization to prevent HSV - 1 from entering neuron cells . Hsp90 Inhibitors Lead to a Reduced Membrane Localization of Coﬁlin by Impairing Hsp90 – Coﬁlin Interaction Given Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone for folding , assembling , and stabilizing many client proteins , which is essential for these client proteins to perform their normal biological functions FIGURE 6 | Hsp90 inhibitors reduce coﬁlin cell membrane distribution . ( A ) The binding of Hsp90 to coﬁlin was reduced in the presence of Hsp90 inhibitors , and the whole - cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with Protein A / G magnetic beads , anti - Hsp90 , and anti - coﬁlin for immunoprecipitation assay , and the samples were detected by Western blot assay . ( B ) Hsp90 inhibitors affected the intracellular localization of coﬁlin ; SH - SY5Y cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 ◦ C , then infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 50 ) at 4 ◦ C for another 1 h in the presence of 17 - AAG or AT533 . The cells were then ﬁxed and stained with anti - coﬁlin antibody ( green ) . Scale bars , 20 µ m , × 40 . ( C ) Hsp90 inhibitors reduced the localization of coﬁlin protein levels on the cell membrane . SH - SY5Y cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 ◦ C and infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 50 ) at 4 ◦ C for another 1 h ; the unbound virus was removed , then treated with 17 - AAG or AT533 for 30 min at 37 ◦ C , and cells were washed with acidic PBS . The cell membrane proteins were extracted to detect the protein level of coﬁlin by Western blotting . Data are mean ± SD ( n = 3 ) . Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 9 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 799890 fmicb - 12 - 799890 January 4 , 2022 Time : 13 : 19 # 10 Song et al . Hsp90’s Role in HSV - 1 Entry ( Bravo - Cordero et al . , 2013 ; Balin and Hudson , 2018 ) , inhibition of Hsp90 function may result in the degradation or abnormal subcellular localization of client proteins ( Prodromou , 2012 ) . To clarify the reason why Hsp90 inhibitors facilitated F - actin polymerization , we analyzed the eﬀect of Hsp90 inhibitors on the ADF / coﬁlin ; the results of co - immunoprecipitation indicated that Hsp90 interacted with coﬁlin , and Hsp90 inhibitors led to a weakened interaction of coﬁlin ( Figure 6A ) . However , Western blot assay showed that Hsp90 inhibitors did not aﬀect the total amount of coﬁlin protein in the stage of HSV - 1 attachment ( Supplementary Figures 6A , B ) or HSV - 1 penetration ( Supplementary Figures 6C , D ) . We further examined the eﬀect of Hsp90 inhibitors on the subcellular localization of coﬁlin during the HSV - 1 infection . Immunoﬂuorescence showed that the Hsp90 inhibitor aﬀected the intracellular localization of coﬁlin , resulting in a signiﬁcant decrease in the localization of coﬁlin at the cell edge ( Figure 6B ) . Considering that actin ﬁlaments are mainly located on the area under the cell membrane , and coﬁlin is also located on the cell membrane and combines with F - actin to play a depolymerization eﬀect ( Nebl et al . , 1996 ; Keezer et al . , 2003 ) , we extracted the cell membrane proteins to detect the level of coﬁlin , and the results conﬁrmed that Hsp90 inhibitors cause a decrease in the level of coﬁlin on the cell membrane during the penetration stage of HSV - 1 ( Figure 6C ) , which may lead to the polymerization of F - actin , thereby inhibiting the entry of HSV - 1 into neuron cells . DISCUSSION HSE is the most common cause of sporadic fatal encephalitis worldwide ( Whitley , 2006 ) , and HSE shows the characteristics of high mortality and poor prognosis in all encephalitis , which is tightly associated with Herpes simplex virus 1 ( HSV - 1 ) infection of the neurons ( Whitley et al . , 1982 ; Whitley , 2006 ) . Speciﬁcally , HSV - 1 can spread from epithelial cells to neurons and cause pathological changes in the central nervous system ( Wang et al . , 2019 ) . However , Hsp90 inhibitors have rarely reported their antiviral eﬀects in neurons . This study demonstrated that Hsp90 inhibitors had antiviral activity against HSV - 1 in nerve cell lines ( Figure 1 ) and inhibited HSV - 1 entry into neuronal cells ( Figure 4 ) . We consider that many viruses have evolved various methods of destroying the actin cytoskeleton to promote self - infection . For example , HIV and HSV - 1 regulate the coﬁlin - mediated F - actin dynamic to facilitate virus entry ( Yoder et al . , 2008 ; Xiang et al . , 2012b ) . The formation of pseudopods was beneﬁcial to HSV - 1 which adsorbs to the cell membrane , but the unidirectional polymerization of F - actin prevented HSV - 1 penetration ( Xiang et al . , 2012b ) . We further examined the eﬀect of Hsp90 inhibitors on ADF / coﬁlin . Speciﬁcally , both Western blotting assay and immunoﬂuorescence experiments showed that Hsp90 inhibitors inhibited the molecular chaperone function of Hsp90 during HSV - 1 infection , which reduced the subcellular localization of coﬁlin on the membrane to promote the assembly of actin structures ( Figure 6 ) . We hypothesize that the inhibition of HSV - 1 penetration was a key rate - limiting step . Whether this phenomenon exists in non - neuronal cells remains to be further explored . It has been reported that geldanamycin , an Hsp90 inhibitor , has a signiﬁcant inhibitory eﬀect against HSV - 1 in Vero cells ( non - neural cells ) . Still , geldanamycin inhibits neither HSV - 1 attachment nor penetration and mainly restrains HSV - 1 replication in vitro ( Li et al . , 2004 ) . However , in the enrichment of microﬁlament skeletons in synapses and dendritic spines in neuron cells , coﬁlin played an important role in the growth and development of nerves , including the formation of neurites , the directional growth of axons and dendrites , the formation of synapses , and the plasticity of neuronal cell dendritic spines ( Sivadasan et al . , 2016 ; Zheng et al . , 2016 ; Tedeschi et al . , 2019 ) , which may be beneﬁcial to Hsp90 inhibitors inhibiting the entry of HSV - 1 into neuron cells by regulating coﬁlin - mediated F - actin reorganization . In summary , this study demonstrated the eﬀects of Hsp90 inhibitors 17 - AAG and AT533 on HSV - 1 infection of neuron cells . Speciﬁcally , we conﬁrmed that Hsp90 inhibitors reduced membrane localization of coﬁlin by impairing Hsp90 - coﬁlin interaction , which led to the unidirectional polymerization of F - actin . However , F - actin polymerization promoted viral attachment but inhibited subsequent viral penetration , which limited the entry of HSV - 1 virions into neuron cells . Our research will provide a novel insight into the mechanism of Hsp90 inhibitors against HSV - 1 and better extend the molecular mechanism of Hsp90 in HSV - 1 infection in neuron cells .
