Never - theless , these specialized invaginations of the plasma membrane remain without clear and recognized physio - logical function . The recent identiﬁcation of new caveo - lar components and the ability to probe cell mechanics with sophisticated opticophysical devices have shed new light on this fascinating organelle . Early studies from the 1970s suggested that caveolae could partici - pate in the regulation of membrane dynamics . Recent data have established caveolae as mechanosensors that respond immediately to mechanical stress by ﬂattening into the plasma membrane . Here , we focus on the mo - lecular consequences that result from the caveolar dis - assembly / reassembly cycle induced by membrane tension variations at the surface of the cell under physi - ological and pathological conditions . Little caves at the plasma membrane Caveolae were ﬁrst identiﬁed during the pioneering years of cell electron microscopy . In 1953 , Nobel Prize winner George Palade reported the presence of caveolae in a seminal abstract describing the ﬁne structure of blood capillaries [ 1 , 2 ] . In 1955 , Yamada described similar ‘cave - like’ struc - tures in the mouse gall bladder epithelium that he referred to as ‘caveolae intracellulares’ [ 3 ] ( Figure 1 ) . Caveolae ( Latin for ‘little caves’ ) are classically de - scribed as small ( 50 – 100 nm ) V - shaped plasma membrane invaginations rich in caveolins , sphingolipids and choles - terol . More recent ultrastructural analysis shows that caveolae are rather cup - shaped invaginations with an open neck sensitive to glutaraldehyde ﬁxation ( hence the V - or ﬂask - shaped morphology observed earlier ) [ 4 , 5 ] . Caveolin - 1 and - 2 ( Cav1 , Cav2 ) are the minimal structural units required for assembly of functional caveolae in non - muscle cells , whereas caveolin - 3 ( Cav3 ) is muscle speciﬁc [ 6 ] . Cholesterol , Cav1 and the recently identiﬁed Cavin - 1 ( see Glossary ) are necessary for caveolar biogenesis , but the exact molecular mechanisms remain poorly under - stood . Caveolar ultrastructure has received comprehensive coverage in recent reviews [ 6 – 8 ] . In this review , we sum - marize recent results that establish a new role for caveolae in the cell response to mechanical stress . We highlight the role of caveolae as mechanosensors and mechanotrans - ducers , and propose that the function of caveolae gravi - tates around their ability to ﬂatten out in response to mechanical stress . We also discuss the physiopathology of several human diseases that are potentially linked to caveolin - related abnormalities in cell mechanics . We begin with a historical account of caveolae preliminary studies that led to the discovery of this new function . Review Glossary Cavins : a recently identified family of four cytosolic proteins with related function and sequence homology that interact with Cav1 . The family includes polymerase I and transcript release factor ( PTRF or Cavin - 1 ) , serum deprivation protein response ( SDPR or Cavin - 2 ) , sdr related gene product that binds to C - kinase ( SRBC or Cavin - 3 ) and muscle - restricted coiled - coil protein ( MURC or Cavin - 4 ) . Cavins are 31 – 47 kDa in molecular weight and constitute large , heteroligomeric complexes that associate with and stabilize assembled caveolar scaffolds at the plasma membrane . Under - expression of Cavins leads to caveolar disassembly and Cav1 degradation [ 96 ] . Membrane elasticity : the ability of the membrane to increase its surface area under tension in a reversible manner . Starting from a smooth lipid bilayer ( i . e . , without undulations or corrugations ) , the elasticity is quantiﬁed by the area expansion modulus , K a , which is deﬁned by s ¼ K a D A = A ( I ) where s is the in - plane tension and D A / A is the change in area induced by stress starting from a membrane at zero tension . K a slightly depends on the lipid composition , but is typically approximately 200 mN / m . Membrane lysis occurs at a tension of approximately 1 – 10 mN / m , which corresponds to a maximal area strain of D A / A (cid:2) 5 % . Nanotube ( or tether ) assay : a biophysical assay that allows the measurement of cell plasma membrane tension . Membrane tethers are formed from the cell surface using adhesive microbeads , which are trapped and manipulated with optical tweezers . The force required to maintain the nanotube is derived from the position of the particle with respect to the center of the optical trap . The membrane tension is directly proportional to the square root of the tether force . Any change in the tether force thus reﬂects a change in the plasma membrane tension . Plasma membrane tension : a force per unit length ( usually in mN / m ) or , equivalently , an energy per unit area ( in mJ / m 2 ) that represents the amount of energy required to form the closed cellular interface between cell interior and exterior . It has two components : the in - plane tension in the lipid bilayer and the adhesion energy between the membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton . Stress : by deﬁnition , a measure of the internal force per unit area of a strained body . By extension , the term stress is also simply used to describe the mechani - cal perturbation leading to the generation of stress within the body . For cells , three types of mechanical perturbations are generally considered : ( i ) osmotic swelling or shrinkage leading to a purely tensile or compressive stress for which the exerted force is normal to the membrane ( respectively outwards or inwards ) ; ( ii ) hydrodynamic ﬂow , which creates a shear stress arising from the drag force applied parallel to the cell surface ; and ( iii ) stretching , leading to a combination of tensile and shear stress .

Caveo - lae and Cav1 have been associated with many functions including endocytosis , transcytosis , cholesterol homeosta - sis , mechanotransduction , cellular signaling , cell prolifer - ation and muscle physiology [ 6 ] . Nevertheless , there remains considerable debate about the actual function of caveolae . Caveolae represent a subtype of plasma mem - brane microdomains of the so - called ‘raft’ type [ 9 ] and as such have an undisputed role in intracellular signaling by conﬁning receptors and signaling molecules at the plasma membrane [ 10 – 12 ] . The morphological resemblance of caveolae to clathrin - coated pits initiated early investiga - tions into the existence of a distinct endocytic pathway operated by caveolae [ 13 – 15 ] . The current consensus is that caveolae are principally stable membrane domains with a potential for internalization that occurs only under speciﬁc conditions [ 16 ] . The confusion about caveolar func - tion is largely due to the limitations of the techniques that have hitherto been used . The recent availability of high - resolution cell imaging microscopy and new molecular tools ( CAV1 - null animals or cells , Cav1 siRNA - based knockdowns , new Cav1 partners such as Cavins ) have allowed the re - evaluation of caveolae and Cav1 functions in a more speciﬁc and mechanistic manner . This has been exempliﬁed by a recent study in which the combination of live cell imaging with membrane physics established a new role for caveolae in cell mechanics [ 17 , 18 ] . Revisiting an old story The association of caveolae with cell mechanics is not recent . It is certainly no coincidence that caveolae were ﬁrst observed in cell types that are constantly exposed to mechanical constraints . The ﬂat monolayer of endothelial cells inside the blood vessels is chronically subjected to shear stress , the frictional force exerted by blood ﬂow . Similarly , epithelium cells of the gall bladder face mechan - ical contraction when bile ﬂuids are released into the intestine . Caveolae are also abundant in adipocytes and muscle cells , which experience swelling and stretching , respectively . In 1960 , Merillees reported striking numbers of ‘caveo - lae intracellulares’ on electron micrographs from rat lumb - rical striated muscles [ 19 ] . The ﬁrst implication of caveolae in cell mechanics came from freeze fracture electron mi - croscopy depicting the presence of ﬂattened caveolae in frog skeletal ﬁbers after mechanical elongation [ 20 ] . Simi - larly , stretching of smooth muscle cells of the sea slug Aplysia californica resulted in the loss of the invaginated shape of caveolae through ﬂattening . Flattening was re - versible , which suggested that caveolae serve as stretch receptors within the plasma membrane [ 21 ] . However , a possible side effect of the mechanical elongation of the muscle ﬁber could not be eliminated . Indeed , rat myoﬁbers showed a drastic diminution of caveolae number only after severe mechanical disruption [ 22 ] . More recently , osmoti - cally induced swelling and pharmacological disruption of cholesterol suggested that caveolae serve as membrane reserves that control swelling - activated chloride ion chan - nels in rat ventricular myocytes [ 23 ] . Additionally , studies of endothelial cells have also implicated caveolae in adap - tation to global shear stress . Thus , chronic and repetitive shear stress applied to the plasma membrane increased the number of caveolae by several fold [ 24 , 25 ] . Finally , signaling studies have associated caveolae with mechan - otransduction .

Review Trends in Cell Biology July 2012 , Vol . 22 , No . 7 382 endothelial cells [ 26 ] , and it was further shown that Cav - 1 and caveolae are necessary for both rapid and long - term mechanotransduction in murine intact blood vessels [ 27 ] . Cyclic stretching resulted in Cav3 redistribution in vascu - lar smooth muscle cells through the activation of Akt kinase [ 28 ] , and stretching of cardiomyocytes led to RhoA and Rac1 activation in a caveola - dependent manner [ 29 ] . The increase of caveolar density induced by shear ﬂow at the surface of endothelial cells is associated with the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) and MAPK [ 30 ] . The lack of live cell investigations , how - ever , has precluded an understanding of how morphologi - cal changes of caveolae can be related to membrane mechanics . Membrane folds and mechanics In vivo , cells are challenged under physiological and path - ological situations by various stresses , including volume changes and stretching ( Table 1 ) [ 31 – 33 ] , which tend to increase tension at the plasma membrane . The ability of cells to accommodate these stresses does not rely on the intrinsic mechanical properties of the plasma membrane , which is almost inelastic , but reveals both a hidden elasticity of the membrane necessary to avoid lysis or bursting , and the existence of reﬁned mechanosensitive mechanisms reg - ulating membrane tension . Indeed , if the plasma membrane behaved as a pre - swollen balloon , the membrane of which stretches on blowing , any stress that requires an increase in membrane area of more than about 3 % would impair mem - brane integrity [ 34 ] . Yet , remarkably , stretching by more than 30 % in cell length or swelling as large as 20 % in volume ( corresponding in both cases to about 15 % in area strain ) are commonly reported [ 33 , 35 ] . In the case of moderate stress , the presence of corrugations or folds at the cell surface ( e . g . , villi , rufﬂes ) may a priori serve as a reserve of membrane to avert any increase in membrane tension [ 36 ] . Nonetheless , such smoothing of the plasma membrane is generally not desired because it implies membrane - to - cytoskeleton de - tachment [ 37 ] , which inevitably leads to alteration of the dynamics of major cellular functions ( e . g . , motility [ 38 ] , endocytosis [ 39 ] ) . Instead , it is generally believed that me - chanically stressed cells undergo a transient membrane tension surge that is relaxed through various mechanisms . For example , activation and opening of ion channels and transporters contribute to regulatory volume decrease subsequent to osmotic swelling [ 33 ] , and thus to regulatory membrane tension decrease . An alternative or complementary strategy to return membrane tension to its resting value may occur through surface area homeostasis [ 40 ] . High tensions would then favor recruitment of membrane to the surface via exocyto - sis processes , whereas low tensions would increase the endocytic rate to retrieve excess membrane . This hypothe - sis has been clearly validated and the calcium - dependent reservoir capacity of cells demonstrated by in situ mea - surements of membrane tension using a nanotube assay on osmotically swollen molluscan neurons [ 41 ] . Moreover , these mechanisms , which require synthesis , transport and fusion of vesicles from the Golgi to the cell surface , are consistent with the characteristic time of membrane tension relaxation , approximately 10 min . However , in contrast to neurons , which lack caveolar structures , endo - thelial and muscle cells were recently shown to exhibit negligible membrane tension sensitivity to osmotic swell - ing and stretching [ 17 ] . Instantaneous membrane tension buffering was shown to be the result of ATP and actin - independent ﬂattening of caveolae . Although this mechan - ical role of caveolae as regulators of the plasma membrane was ﬁrst suggested by theoretical physicists [ 42 ] , it was further experimentally shown that caveolar ﬂattening is accompanied by complete and rapid disassembly of the caveolar structure by free diffusion of caveolins in the plasma membrane ( within less than 30 s ) [ 17 ] . On release of the mechanical stress , the initial density of the caveolae is recovered , suggesting that the process is reversible . Interestingly , however , the mechanism is not identical ; disassembly is purely passive , driven by the mechanical state of the membrane , whereas reassembly is ATP - and actin - dependent . This new mechanical role of caveolae appears to be key in membrane tension homeostasis . Caveolar ﬂattening , a new concept in cell mechanics Besides providing additional membrane for buffering sur - face area changes induced by mechanical stress , caveolar ﬂattening also leads to the dissociation of Cavin - 1 from Cav1 and increases the amount of free diffusing Cav1 at the inner face of the plasma membrane . Cavin - 1 / PTRF belongs to a recently discovered family of cytosolic proteins implicated in caveolar biogenesis [ 43 , 44 ] .

Intriguingly , mechanical stress could not ﬂatten more than 40 – 50 % of caveolae in endothelial cells [ 17 ] . It is possible that caveolae are present in a large excess to ensure the full capacity of the membrane reser - voir even under extreme membrane tension variations . Moreover , it was found that caveolar ﬂattening occurs independent of the actin cytoskeleton within the ﬁrst minutes of mechanical stress . After longer periods of stress , however , the actin cytoskeleton is reorganized [ 17 ] , suggesting that it may substitute for caveolae , which would explain why only a fraction of caveolae is solicited initially . Interestingly , it was recently shown that stress ﬁbers can also control caveolar ﬂattening and trafﬁcking [ 45 ] . Consequently , it will be important to document whether the fraction of ﬂattened caveolae increases with prolonged stress exposure . Another hypothesis is that mechanical stress solicits only a particular population of caveolae . No direct evidence has documented the existence of molecularly distinct subpopulations of caveolae . Never - theless , live cell imaging has revealed kinetically different pools of caveolae that are stable at the plasma membrane , or display kiss - and - run movements or long - range cyto - plasmic transport [ 46 ] . At ﬁrst glance , osmotic shock equal - ly affected the different pools of caveolae [ 17 ] . Distinct kinases selectively regulate the dynamics of these subpo - pulations [ 46 ] . These kinases may be involved in the rapid reassembly of caveolae on stress release , which , in contrast to disassembly , requires ATP [ 17 ] . The newly identiﬁed Cav1 partners could also participate in the assembly of molecularly distinct caveolae . Whether Cavin - 2 / SDPR , Cavin - 3 / SRBC and muscle speciﬁc Cavin - 4 / MURC , which form a complex with Cavin - 1 [ 47 ] , are uniformly distribut - ed in caveolae is unknown . Pacsin - 2 and EHD2 are two other recently identiﬁed players in caveolar biogenesis [ 48 – 50 ] . Pacsin - 2 / syndapin - 2 is an F - BAR domain - contain - ing protein that tubulates membranes and was recently proposed to invaginate ﬂat Cav1 domains into budded caveolae at the plasma membrane [ 49 ] . Pacsin - 2 also binds to EHD2 , a member of the EHD ( Eps15 homology domain ) protein family , which is involved in membrane trafﬁcking [ 51 ] . EHD2 has been copuriﬁed with Cav1 in adipocytes [ 48 ] and can associate with caveolae through pacsin - 2 , but its role remains unclear [ 49 ] . EHD2 and pascsin - 2 partially localize with caveolae , again underlying the existence of molecularly distinct sets of caveolae . Monitoring the dy - namics of EHD2 and pacsin - 2 with caveolae will no doubt elucidate how different types of mechanical stress may differentially affect these interactions . It is likely that the experimental settings used to induce 40 – 50 % caveolar ﬂattening represent extreme situations rarely met in vivo . Thus , ﬂattening may concern only a limited number of caveolae in response to moderate and localized membrane tension variations . If so , it should be possible to observe ‘ﬂattened’ caveolae at any time at the plasma membrane . Freeze fracture preparations of Aplysia smooth muscle revealed that several caveolae were already ﬂattened at steady state [ 21 ] . More recently , in rapidly frozen mouse ﬁbroblasts , different degrees of caveolar invagination could be observed , including almost ﬂat struc - tures [ 5 ] ( Figure 1 ) . In this context , the ﬂattening of a few caveolae could represent a highly sensitive mechanosen - sing device to rapidly adapt the cell response to local ﬂuctuations of tension at the plasma membrane . Signals outside the cave Intracellular signaling is a key process that is likely to be modulated by caveolar ﬂattening . Various signaling mole - cules interact with Cav1 [ 11 , 12 , 52 ] . Several of these inter - actions depend on Cav1 dynamics . In vascular smooth muscle cells , the translocation of Cav1 from caveolar to non - caveolar membrane domains is required for ERK ki - nase activation induced by cyclic stretching [ 53 ] . This translocation most likely corresponds to the release of free Cav1 reported in [ 17 ] . Furthermore , chronic exposure of bovine aortic endothelial cells to laminar shear stress led to ERK inactivation and Akt activation only after transloca - tion of Cav1 from the Golgi complex to the plasma mem - brane [ 24 ] . Other signaling molecules that are modulated by mechanical stress and caveolae include Src family kinases [ 54 ] , Rho and Rac small GTPases [ 29 ] , eNOS [ 55 ] , calcium [ 56 ] and the MAP kinases [ 57 ] . There are several non - mutually exclusive mechanisms by which caveolae ﬂattening could modulate mechano - signaling . Cav1 contains a speciﬁc domain called the Caveolin Scaffolding Domain ( CSD ) , thought to facilitate the interaction and organization of signaling molecules within caveolae ( Figure 2 ) . The role of the CAV1 CSD in signal transduction was ﬁrst proposed for eNOS regula - tion . Mimetic peptides illustrated that the interaction of eNOS with CAV1 CSD resulted in eNOS inactivation in vivo [ 58 , 59 ] . The essential amino acids within the CSD required for eNOS binding and negative regulation were recently identiﬁed [ 60 ] . The Cav1 CSD is supposed to form an in - plane amphipathic helix buried within the mem - brane in assembled caveolae [ 61 ] . Hence , the binding of signaling molecules to Cav1 CSD in caveolae would result in inactivation , whereas binding to non - caveolar Cav1 CSD would activate signaling ( Figure 2 ) . Whether the interac - tion of other signaling molecules with Cav1 occurs through the same mechanism is yet to be established . The role of non - caveolar Cav1 has remained elusive . The ﬁnding that Cavin - 1 association with Cav1 is required for assembling caveolae highlights a role for non - caveolar Cav1 that is independent of caveolae [ 43 ] . Several types of neurons , which do not have caveolae , express Cav1 and / or Cav1 - interacting proteins , and CAV1 deleted mice ex - hibit higher neuronal differentiation [ 62 , 63 ] . Initial stud - ies failed to detect Cav1 and caveolae in lymphocytes [ 64 ] ; however , B lymphocytes express Cav1 [ 65 ] . Cav1 expres - sion may be related to the activation of blood cells , because Cav1 is also expressed in adult T cell leukemia cell lines [ 66 ] . Moreover T lymphoma resistance to interferon alpha treatment is linked to the expression of Cav1 [ 67 ] . These data support a model in which non - caveolar and caveolar Cav1 have distinct functions . Expression of Cav1 at low levels results in the assembly of stable oligomerized Cav1 microdomains , or scaffolds [ 68 , 69 ] . The size and number of Cav1 molecules present in these scaffolds is unknown , but previous studies have Review Trends in Cell Biology July 2012 , Vol . 22 , No . 7 384 reported that a minimum of 15 Cav1 molecules is required to assemble stable SDS - resistant oligomers in vitro and in vivo [ 70 ] . Cav1 scaffolds are not always associated with positive signaling , because they can inhibit EGFR signal - ing by reducing its diffusion rate at the plasma membrane [ 68 ] . The combination of proteomics with subdiffraction - limit microscopy conﬁrmed that Cav1 scaffolds are struc - turally and functionally distinct from caveolae [ 71 ] . Cav1 can therefore exist as three different entities at the plasma membrane : caveolar Cav1 , non - caveolar Cav1 scaffolds Nucleus Gene transcriptionactivation Golgi Clathrin - independentendocytosis Caveola Caveola flattening Non - caveolar Cav1 scaffold FreeCav1 CaveolarCav1 StretchingSwelling Steady state Mechanical stress FreeCavin Lateendosome Recycling endosome Lysosome Caveolinscaffoldingdomain 82 101 N - ter C - ter Φ X Φ X X X X Φ X X Φ ? ? ?

Molecular and cellular consequences of caveolar flattening induced by mechanical stress . Under resting conditions , caveolae are mostly budded at the plasma membrane . On acute mechanical stress ( hypo - osmotic swelling or stretching ) , caveolae flatten out in the plasma membrane to provide additional membrane and buffer membrane tension . Caveolar flattening releases Cav1 and Cavin - 1 from the caveolar structure , increasing the amount of freely diffusing Cav1 and Cavin - 1 at the plasma membrane . On the removal of the force , Cavin - 1 and Cav1 rapidly reassemble into caveolae in an ATP - dependent process . This cycle represents the primary cell response to acute mechanical stress [ 17 ] . Non - caveolar Cav1 is likely to be internalized by a clathrin - independent pathway that remains to be characterized . Endocytosed Cav1 becomes detectable in late endosomes ( LE ) and lysosomes , where it is degraded [ 72 ] . It can also accumulate in the recycling endosome [ 97 ] . Whether Cav1 and Cavin - 1 follow identical intracellular routes after their release from caveolae by mechanical stress is unknown . It is possible that the endosomal ( black arrows ) and Golgi ( orange arrow ) pools of Cav1 are solicited during prolonged shear stress when the caveolar density is increased several - fold at the plasma membrane [ 24 , 25 , 30 ] . Another possibility is that the released Cavins ( green arrow ) activate cellular processes to induce caveolar biogenesis , thereby increasing membrane reservoir size . Caveolar flattening can modulate mechanosignaling by several non - mutually exclusive mechanisms ( lightning arrows ) . Released Cav1 and Cavins may interfere with the organization and dynamics of membrane microdomains and associated signaling molecules at the plasma membrane and endosomes . Gene transcription may be activated as a result of the nuclear translocation of released Cavins . Magnification shows insertion of Cav1 and the Cav1 scaffolding domain ( CSD ) into the caveolar structure . The Cav1 CSD is a conserved peptide sequence ( DGIWKASFTTFTVTKYWFYR , amino acids 82 – 101 ) that mediates protein – protein interactions through a caveolin - binding domain comprising an aromatic - rich sequence F X F XXXX F XX F ( where F is an aromatic residue ) found in several signaling partners . The Cav1 CSD would form an in - plane amphipathic helix buried within the membrane in assembled caveolae [ 61 ] . Seminal in vivo studies on eNOS signaling proposed a model in which binding to the Cav1 CSD in caveolae leads to inactivation , whereas binding to non - caveolar Cav1 CSD activates signaling [ 58 – 60 ] . Many signaling molecules including several receptor and non - receptor tyrosine kinases and their downstream effectors , adenyl cyclase , G protein - coupled receptors , and various kinases such as PI3K , PKC , MAPK and ERK have been shown to interact with the Cav1 CSD in vitro [ 88 ] . Whether the eNOS model can be applied to their activation / inactivation cycle in vivo remains to be demonstrated . Review Trends in Cell Biology July 2012 , Vol . 22 , No . 7 385 and single Cav1 molecules ( Figure 2 ) . At steady state , the amount of free Cav1 present at the plasma membrane is very low or even undetectable [ 17 , 43 , 46 , 72 ] . On mechani - cal stress , however , TIRF - FRAP microscopy measure - ments detected a threefold increase of freely diffusing Cav1 [ 17 ] . The release of Cavin - 1 may also interfere with the dynamics of Cav1 scaffolds because Cavin - 1 knock - down leads to higher Cav1 lateral mobility [ 43 ] . Caveolar ﬂattening also results in the redistribution of glycosphin - golipids at the plasma membrane , a process that is likely to modulate stretch - induced signaling [ 73 ] . Caveolae there - fore constitute a reservoir of Cav1 molecules ( an average of 150 – 200 Cav1 per caveola ) and lipids that can be released to control mechanosignaling under physiological and path - ological conditions . Cav1 can be phosphorylated at tyrosine 14 ( pY14 ) or serine 80 in response to various stimuli . pY14 Cav1 has been implicated in the organization of scaffolds associated with focal adhesions [ 12 ] . The role of Cav1 phosphorylation has not been investigated during mechani - cal stress . Similarly , the role of Cavin - 1 serine phosphory - lation is unknown in this context [ 48 ] . Another mechanism by which caveolar ﬂattening could control mechanotransduction is through the release of transcription factors . In endothelial cells , shear stress can activate transcription factors such as AP - 1 , NF - k B , Sp - 1 and Egr - 1 , which in turn induces genes encoding factors that modulate vascular structure and function [ 74 ] . FLIM - FRET microscopy revealed that caveolar ﬂat - tening also leads to the rapid dissociation of Cavin - 1 from Cav1 [ 17 ] ( Figure 2 ) . Cavin - 1 was initially named Pol I and transcript release factor ( PTRF ) and was found to increase ribosomal gene transcription [ 75 ] . Cavin - 1 release from caveolae could therefore modulate cell signaling through cytosolic interactions , or nuclear translocation and gene activation ( Figure 2 ) . In contrast to acute osmotic shock or stretching , chronic shear stress increases the number of caveolae at the plasma membrane by several - fold [ 24 , 25 , 30 ] . This may be associated with increased Cav1 synthesis through Cavin - 1 - dependent nuclear gene activa - tion . Whether the other Cavin members control gene tran - scription through nuclear translocation is unknown . Recently , it was suggested that Cav2 can enter the nucleus and activate transcription events [ 76 , 77 ] . Thus , caveolar disassembly initiated by mechanical stress would result in increased Cav1 synthesis through gene transcription , thereby augmenting the size of the caveolar reservoir at the plasma membrane . Caveolae and trafﬁcking under mechanical stress Caveola - dependent mechanosignaling could also be modu - lated through the trafﬁcking of released Cavins and Cav1 within the endosomal network . At steady state , few caveo - lae undergo endocytosis [ 16 ] , which is compatible with the maintenance of a stable membrane reservoir . In agree - ment with the impairment of endocytosis at high mem - brane tension [ 39 ] , Cav1 is not endocytosed during the ﬁrst minutes of osmotic stress [ 17 ] . Under prolonged stress , other regulators such as the actin cytoskeleton [ 17 ] , and the delivery of additional membrane through exocytosis , probably substitute for caveolae . The fate of the excess free Cav1 at the plasma membrane is unknown . However , studies analyzing intracellular trafﬁcking of Cav1 under conditions that promote excess non - caveolar Cav1 at the plasma membrane suggest that it undergoes endocytosis [ 43 , 72 ] ( Figure 2 ) . Stress - related caveolinopathies Several human diseases are associated with deﬁciencies in caveolar function ( Table 1 ) . Here , we focus on two patholo - gies that may be related to defects in the caveola - mediated cell mechanical response . Muscular dystrophies ( MDs ) are a group of diverse genetic diseases causing progressive weakness and degeneration of skeletal muscles [ 78 ] . Sev - eral Cav3 mutations have been described in human MD , in which membrane fragility and / or defects in membrane repair are frequently observed [ 79 , 80 ] . Cav3 , cloned in 1996 , is the principal structural protein of caveolae in striated ( i . e . , skeletal muscle , diaphragm and heart ) and smooth muscle cells [ 81 ] . Cav3 is localized to the muscle cell plasma membrane where it forms a complex with glycoproteins and dystrophin , a product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) gene [ 82 ] . DMD , the most common and severe form of human MD , is classically associated with increased muscle membrane fragility . DMD patients show increased Cav3 expression and cave - olar numbers [ 83 ] . Limb - girdle MD ( LGMD ) encompasses a heterogeneous group of myopathies associated with muta - tions in the dysferlin complex , which mediates membrane repair . LGMD1C patients have mutations in Cav3 , which , in contrast to DMD , lead to a major loss of Cav3 expression through abnormal Golgi retention and increased degrada - tion [ 84 ] . Additional Cav3 mutations have also been found in rippling muscle disease , distal myopathy and familial hyperCKemia ( FHCK ) [ 85 ] . Both dysferlin and the dystro - phin – glycoprotein complex have been associated with Cav3 [ 78 ] . The role of caveolae in MD is unclear and could possibly involve T - tubule formation , calcium homeostasis and cou - pling to dysferlin or dystrophin - associated proteins 85 ] . Most MD - associated Cav3 mutants are retained at the Golgi complex , thereby preventing the assembly of func - tional caveolae at the plasma membrane [ 8 ] . It is therefore possible that Cav3 mutations impair caveola - dependent mechanosensing and , as a result , the buffering of mem - brane tension variations occurring during the extension and relaxation cycles of muscle cells . Membrane tension measurements in Cav3 P28L mutants isolated from FHCK patients support this hypothesis . Thus , FHCK myotubes display abnormally elevated membrane tension on osmotic shock and membrane rupture [ 17 ] . New investigations combining membrane physics and high - resolution cell im - aging will reveal whether and how caveolar mechanosen - sing is altered in LGMD and DMD . It is worth noting that mutations affecting Cavin - 1 also result in MDs [ 86 , 87 ] . Whether similar mutations exist for the muscle - speciﬁc Cavin - 4 has not yet been reported . Cancer is another pathology in which caveolae may play a crucial role through their mechanosensing and mechano - signaling functions . Tumor tissue often exhibits enhanced rigidity in comparison to the surrounding tissue . This is due both to increased rigidity of the stromal microenviron - ment ( e . g . , ﬁbroblasts , blood vessels , extracellular matrix ) Review Trends in Cell Biology July 2012 , Vol . 22 , No . 7 386 and to the intrinsic increase of membrane tension in tumor cells [ 88 ] . Although this aspect is well known to patholo - gists , it remains poorly explored at the molecular level . Recent evidence shows that biomechanical factors such as extracellular matrix stiffness , conﬁned adhesiveness or shear pressure in vessels can crucially inﬂuence tumor evolution [ 89 , 90 ] . Epidemiological , genetic , molecular and clinical data converge to demonstrate that caveolae and / or Cav1 are involved in several processes linked to tumor growth . However , the role of caveolae remains unclear , with studies reporting both oncogenic and tumor suppres - sor functions within a particular tumor type [ 91 , 92 ] . In fact , the expression of Cav1 in human cancer cell lines and tumor samples seems to depend on tumor type and stage [ 93 ] . Recently , Cavin - 1 , - 2 and - 3 were found to be down - regulated in breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor tissues [ 94 ] . It is likely that the mechanodependent cycle of caveolar disassembly / reassembly will be affected in cellular microenvironments with increased membrane ten - sion and rigidity such as those experienced by cancer and stromal cells during tumor mass progression [ 95 ] . How - ever , the role of caveolae in mechanical force buffering and mechanotransduction in solid tumors has not been studied . In addition to these two well - documented examples , other pathologies such as pulmonary hypertension and bladder smooth muscle hypertrophy exhibit caveolin - relat - ed disorders ( Table 1 ) . One can speculate that the defects in Cav1 and Cavin - 1 described in the endothelial and muscle cells of these patients will lead to impaired caveola - mediat - ed responses to mechanical stress . Cavin - 1 and Cav1 muta - tions have also been associated with severe lipodystrophies ( Table 1 ) . Whereas an alteration of the classical role of caveolae in lipid trafﬁcking and metabolism can account for these disorders , possible defects in mechanosensing should also be considered , especially in adipocytes that experience lipid - induced swelling . In this context , the high level of cholesterol present in caveolae may also contribute to their mechanics . Further analysis is required to know whether cholesterol redistributes from mobile Cav1 or is retained in the ﬂattened domain on mechanical stress . Concluding remarks For several decades , caveolae have remained as mysteri - ous plasma membrane invaginations associated with numerous functions as diverse as cell signaling , lipid metabolism , cell migration , mitosis and cell adhesion . New mechanistic and imaging approaches have recently unveiled a key role of these specialized membrane domains in the cell mechanical response . Whether caveolar ﬂatten - ing is signiﬁcant in cells chronically subjected to mechani - cal constraints or more discrete during localized membrane tension variations , the ensuing on / off cycle of caveolar disassembly / reassembly will probably affect several of the functions that have been assigned to caveolae over the years . One such function is signaling . The extent of caveolar ﬂattening will condition the mechanotransdu - cing activity within the various contexts in which cells experience short or prolonged and reversible or permanent mechanical constraints . It is now important to revisit the cellular functions of caveolae through this new mechan - osensing role and to understand how the multiple functions of caveolae are integrated with the diversity of the mechanical cell response in physiological and patho - logical contexts .
