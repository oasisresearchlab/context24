SUMMARY 21 SARS - CoV - 2 superspreading occurs when transmission is highly efficient and / or an individual 22 infects many others , contributing to rapid spread . To better quantify heterogeneity in SARS - 23 CoV - 2 transmission , particularly superspreading , we performed a systematic review of 24 transmission events with data on secondary attack rates or contact tracing of individual index 25 cases published before September 2021 , prior to emergence of variants of concern and 26 widespread vaccination . We reviewed 592 distinct events and 9 , 883 index cases from 491 27 papers . Meta - analysis of secondary attack rates identified substantial heterogeneity across 12 28 event types / settings , with the highest transmission ( 25 – 35 % ) in co - living situations including 29 households , nursing homes , and other congregate housing . Among index cases , 67 % produced 30 zero secondary cases and only 3 % ( 287 ) infected > 5 secondary cases ( “superspreaders” ) . The 31 highest percentage of superspreaders was among symptomatic individuals , individuals aged 49 – 32 64 years , and individuals with over 100 total contacts . However , only 55 % of index cases 33 reported age , sex , symptoms , real - time PCR cycle threshold values , or total contacts . Despite the 34 limitations , our review highlighted that SARS - CoV - 2 superspreading is more likely in settings 35 with prolonged close contact and among symptomatic adults with many contacts . Enhanced 36 reporting on transmission events and contact tracing could help explain heterogeneity and 37 facilitate control efforts . 38 39 KEYWORDS 40 coronavirus ; COVID - 19 ; transmission ; heterogeneity ; infectious disease epidemiology 41 42 .

Understanding drivers of SARS - 45 CoV - 2 transmission was crucial for formulating control measures , especially prior to the 46 development of vaccines . Early in the pandemic , heterogeneity in transmission , particularly 47 superspreading , was investigated because of its ability to cause large outbreaks [ 2 – 4 ] . 48 Superspreading involves two distinct but non - mutually exclusive phenomena : a setting where 49 many people become infected due to an environment conducive to transmission ( e . g . , crowded 50 indoor settings ) , and individuals who are outliers in the number of secondary cases they infect , 51 due to biological heterogeneity in infectiousness and / or high - risk behaviors [ 5 , 6 ] . Both 52 phenomena have garnered considerable attention in the literature . For example , over 140 53 individuals were infected during a Christmas event in Belgium in December 2020 , causing over 54 26 deaths [ 7 ] . Likewise , one individual infected dozens of people during a choir practice in 55 Washington , USA , in March 2020 [ 8 ] . 56 Because superspreading events contributed substantially to local and global SARS - CoV - 57 2 transmission [ 9 ] , public health interventions were enacted to reduce their risk of occurrence . 58 These interventions included school closures , limitations on indoor gatherings , and restrictions 59 on visiting hospitalized patients or long - term care facilities . Many of these policies were based 60 on limited data from early in the pandemic . Moreover , published systematic reviews and 61 modeling of SARS - CoV - 2 superspreading from this period were limited in scope and did not 62 adequately address the dual nature of superspreading . For example , studies of setting - specific 63 transmission rates have focused on household and healthcare transmission or geographic and 64 temporal trends [ 2 , 10 – 13 ] , but did not address transmission heterogeneity across other social 65 .

Previous meta - analyses of individual - level superspreading included only a small 66 number of papers ( < 26 ) that calculated overdispersion in transmission , missing the majority of 67 published transmission trees and capturing data primarily from Asia [ 14 , 15 ] . Early investigations 68 of individual - level characteristics related to superspreading were also limited by incomplete 69 contact tracing [ 16 , 17 ] and a focus on clinical over demographic characteristics [ 16 ] . A more 70 complete summary of superspreading is needed to understand the scale of transmission 71 heterogeneity across settings and identify causes of individual heterogeneity . 72 The objective of this review was to summarize global heterogeneity in SARS - CoV - 2 73 transmission events prior to widespread vaccination and the role of environmental and individual 74 factors in superspreading . Specifically , this review aimed to identify : 1 ) which settings had the 75 highest attack rates ; 2 ) the individual offspring distribution for SARS - CoV - 2 ; and 3 ) the 76 characteristics of superspreading individuals . 77 78 METHODS 79 Literature search and data extraction 80 We conducted this systematic review and meta - analysis according to the Preferred 81 Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses ( PRISMA ) 2020 statement [ 18 ] ; see 82 Appendix 1 for the PRISMA checklist . We included all studies of SARS - CoV - 2 that contained 83 data on : 1 ) transmission chains ; 2 ) numbers of index cases , contacts , and infected contacts ; 3 ) 84 numbers of index cases and infected contacts ; or 4 ) secondary attack rates , i . e . , number of 85 infected contacts divided by number of contacts . We excluded studies that were not about 86 humans . A clinical informationist searched PubMed , the WHO COVID database , the I Love 87 Evidence COVID database , and Embase on 9 September 2021 .

Results were imported into EndNote X9 ( Clarivate , London , UK ) where 89 duplicates with exact matches in the author , year , and title fields were removed . Team members 90 screened titles and abstracts and performed full text review in Covidence ( Veritas Health 91 Innovation , Melbourne , Australia ) . 92 We extracted data using a pre - designed , study - specific spreadsheet , collecting 93 information on paper metadata and target variables for transmission events and individual index 94 cases ( Table 1 ) . Events were defined as discrete transmission events where secondary attack 95 rates for defined groups of people could be calculated as the number of infected cases divided by 96 the total number of exposed individuals . This definition of secondary attack rates includes both 97 clinical and subclinical infections in some studies . Due to the limited details published in the 98 literature , we did not attempt to distinguish events associated with individual transmission chains 99 from a single source ( potentially with confirmatory sequencing data ) from events that aggregated 100 multiple transmission chains together . In lieu of this distinction , we separated events into 101 different settings and by the duration of the event ( i . e . , exposure window , in days ) reported in 102 each paper . Twelve event types were chosen to classify each event / setting described in a paper 103 ( Table 2 ) . To describe individual contributions to transmission , we extracted data on index cases 104 for whom contacts were followed to identify secondary transmission . We only entered data from 105 papers where it was clear from the methods that contact tracing was done for at least one week to 106 capture secondary transmission from individual index cases . For studies that did not report 107 SARS - CoV - 2 variants , we imputed the dominant variant from CoVariants data for the country 108 and time period of interest [ 19 ] .

Because not all individuals potentially exposed during an event were tested in each 116 study , secondary attack rates for individual events were calculated separately using the total 117 number of exposed individuals or the total number tested . If either of these quantities were 118 missing , the value was imputed based on the value present ( i . e . , assuming the number tested was 119 equal to the number exposed or vice versa ) . Sensitivity of results to this choice of denominator 120 was assessed in the meta - analysis of events ( see Supplementary Material ) . 121 Meta - analysis was performed on secondary attack rates across event types using the 122 metafor package in R v4 . 2 . 2 [ 20 ] . We converted secondary attack rates for each event to 123 Freeman - Tukey double arcsine transformed proportions [ 21 ] and calculated the sampling 124 variance . We fit a hierarchical model with a nested random effect for event within study and no 125 fixed effects to assess the heterogeneity in secondary attack rates attributable to these factors 126 using restricted maximum likelihood . We calculated I 2 , the percentage of variance attributable to 127 true heterogeneity , for each random effect [ 22 ] and used Cochran’s Q test to test if estimated 128 heterogeneity in secondary attack rates was greater than expected from the sampling error alone . 129 We then fit additional mixed - effects models that included the same random effects but also event 130 type and event duration as fixed effects . Cochran’s Q was performed on these model to assess 131 whether residual heterogeneity in secondary attack rates was greater than expected after 132 accounting for sampling error and fixed effects . Fitted coefficients and 95 % confidence intervals 133 ( CI ) from meta - analysis were back - transformed to proportions using the geometric mean of the 134 .

[ 23 ] . We estimated the percentile of index 137 cases producing 80 % of all secondary infections using a formula and code from Endo et al . [ 24 ] . 138 Based on the availability of demographic characteristics and other features of index cases in the 139 literature , we examined differences in distributions of secondary cases produced by index cases 140 according to sex , presence / absence of symptoms , age , real - time PCR cycle threshold ( Ct ) value , 141 and the total number of contacts each index case had . Additional statistical tests compared these 142 listed factors between “superspreaders” ( index cases with > 5 secondary cases , following Adam 143 et al . [ 3 ] ) and “non - superspreaders” ( index cases with ≤ 5 secondary cases ) : Chi - square tests of 144 proportions to compare the proportion of women , the proportion of symptomatic cases , and 145 proportion of adults or across age bins ; Student’s t - tests to compare mean age and Ct value ; and 146 a Kruskal - Wallis test to compare the highly skewed distributions of total contacts among index 147 cases . All statistical tests used α = 0 . 05 as the statistical significance threshold . 148 149 RESULTS 150 Study selection 151 We identified 13 , 632 articles from the four databases searched , representing 8 , 339 unique 152 references ( Figure 1 ) . Of these , we excluded 7 , 358 records during the abstract review . For the 153 981 records that underwent full text review , we excluded 384 records that were reviews or letters 154 to the editor without data , contained no data on our variables of interest , or were duplicate 155 records ( preprints , true duplicates , or duplicated datasets ) . A total of 598 papers were assessed 156 for eligibility for data extraction and a further 107 papers were excluded that did not contain data 157 .

We extracted data from 491 158 studies : 232 studies provided event data only , 195 studies provided individual index case data 159 only , and 64 studies provided both data types , yielding evidence from 592 distinct events and 160 9 , 883 index cases . The 491 analyzed studies were from 67 countries , with most from China 161 ( 26 % ) , the USA ( 17 % ) , and South Korea ( 5 % ) ( Supplementary Figure S1A ) . Although our 162 search included two - thirds of 2021 , nearly all studies covered data from 2020 ( 94 % of events , 163 99 % of index case symptom onset or positive test dates ) . 164 165 Heterogeneity in event secondary attack rates 166 Event data were most commonly from the USA ( 27 % ) , China ( 15 % ) , the UK ( 8 % ) , and 167 South Korea ( 6 % ) ( Supplementary Figure S1B ) . Published papers were missing information on 168 many variables that we aimed to extract about events ( Supplementary Figure S2A ) . Of the 46 169 target data fields from articles about events , 17 had high data completeness ( > 80 % ) , including 170 those for the study and event metadata , event description , time period of the event ( describing 171 the start and end dates of exposure ) , location of the event ( country and state / province or city ) , 172 and number of exposed individuals and secondary cases ( Supplementary Table S3 ) . Event 173 durations were highly skewed , with a median duration of 34 days and an interquartile range of 174 13 – 60 days ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . Studies used a variety of diagnostic methods to identify 175 SARS - CoV - 2 cases , though PCR was the dominant method ( Supplementary Figure S4A ) . Other 176 approaches included antigen tests , retrospective case identification by serology , diagnosis via 177 symptoms or chest tomography in early papers , or a mixture of approaches . Because most studies 178 covered events prior to emergence of variants , most events ( N = 532 , 90 % ) likely involved only 179 wild - type / ancestral SARS - CoV - 2 , while 14 events involved Alpha , six Beta , eight Delta , and 31 180 .

Meta - analysis of secondary attack rates including a 187 nested random effect for event within study detected significant heterogeneity in secondary 188 attack rates ( I 2 = 99 % , Cochran’s Q E , 591 = 141 , 765 , P < 0 . 0001 ) . The random effect for study 189 accounted for most of the heterogeneity ( I 2study = 58 % ) , followed by event nested within study 190 ( I 2event = 41 % ) . Addition of a fixed effect for event type to the model indicated that secondary 191 attack rates varied significantly across event types ( Cochran’s Q M , 11 = 122 , P < 0 . 0001 ) . Mean 192 secondary attack rates from meta - analysis were lowest for shopping ( 0 % ) , hospitals and 193 healthcare ( 6 % ) , transportation other than cruise ships ( 9 % ) , and schools ( 11 % ) ( Figure 2 ) . 194 Comparatively , estimated mean attack rates were two to three times higher ( 25 – 35 % ) in nursing 195 homes , cruise ships , households , and other congregate housing settings ( e . g . , homeless shelters , 196 prisons ) . Models including event duration and an interaction term between event type and event 197 duration as additional fixed effects found similar levels of heterogeneity ( Cochran’s Q M , 23 = 135 , 198 P < 0 . 0001 ) and identified a common trend of decreasing attack rates with longer event durations 199 across different event types , with the exception of cruise ships and shopping ( Supplementary 200 Figure S5 ) . 201 202 .

Index case data exhibited higher 205 missingness compared to events ( Supplementary Figure S2B ) : of the 74 data fields that we 206 extracted for individual index cases , the highest completeness ( > 60 % ) was seen for study and 207 index case numbers , location of the index case ( country and state / province or city ) , total number 208 of contacts infected , method of testing for the index case and contacts , and SARS - CoV - 2 variant 209 ( Supplementary Table S4 ) . We identified five key characteristics of index cases that could be 210 related to superspreading , though most of these were also missing from the published literature : 211 46 % of cases included data on age , 48 % on sex , 10 % on presence / absence of symptoms , 6 % on 212 total number of contacts , and only 2 % had Ct values reported . A total of 5 , 437 index cases ( 55 % ) 213 contained data on at least one of these five variables . Diagnostic methods for identification of 214 individual index cases and their associated secondary cases were only reported in 61 % of cases , 215 with PCR as the primary approach ( Supplementary Figure S4B , C ) . The majority of index cases 216 ( N = 8 , 565 , 87 % ) were assumed to be infected with wild - type SARS - CoV - 2 based on location 217 and timing of the study or test confirmation date . A mixture of variants was likely in 1 , 282 cases 218 ( 13 % ) , while one index case was reported with Alpha , two Beta , 11 Delta , and 22 Epsilon . 219 Most index cases ( 67 % ) did not transmit SARS - CoV - 2 to another person and 17 % 220 transmitted to only one other individual ( Figure 3 ) . There were 287 “superspreaders” with > 5 221 contacts infected , representing 3 % of index cases from the included studies . The distribution of 222 secondary infections fit a negative binomial distribution with a mean of 0 . 88 ( CI : 0 . 84 – 0 . 92 ) and 223 a dispersion parameter k of 0 . 27 ( CI : 0 . 25 – 0 . 28 ) . Using the formula from Endo et al . [ 24 ] and the 224 estimated mean and k for the negative binomial distribution , the top 17 % most infectious index 225 .

The proportion of index cases with reported symptoms was higher in superspreaders 228 ( 89 % ) than non - superspreaders ( 76 % ; χ 21 = 5 . 4 , P = 0 . 02 ) . Superspreaders had more than two 229 times the mean number of contacts ( 79 ) compared to non - superspreaders ( 36 ; χ 21 = 56 . 6 , P < 230 0 . 0001 ) . Adults also made up a greater proportion of superspreaders ( 99 % ) than non - 231 superspreaders ( 84 % ; χ 21 = 14 . 1 , P < 0 . 0001 ) . Index cases over 25 years of age were 232 overrepresented among superspreaders and no superspreaders 12 years of age and under were 233 reported ( Figure 4 ) . When age was analyzed as a continuous variable , the number of contacts 234 infected and the frequency of superspreaders increased with age , up to around 60 years of age 235 ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) . No significant differences by sex or Ct values were observed ( Table 236 3 ) . However , two adult male index cases produced the highest number of secondary infections , 237 infecting 81 of their 104 contacts and 101 of their 300 contacts , respectively . The former was a 238 lecturer in Tonghua , China [ 25 ] and the latter a fitness instructor in Hong Kong , China [ 26 ] . 239 Symptomatic cases had a higher mean number of infected contacts ( 2 . 1 ) compared to 240 asymptomatic cases ( 0 . 7 ) ( Table 4 ) . The dispersion parameter k was higher for symptomatic 241 cases than asymptomatic cases ( 0 . 43 vs . 0 . 11 ) , indicating lower variance in the number of 242 secondary cases produced by a symptomatic case . This variance is exemplified by the lower 243 percentage of non - transmitters ( 44 % ) and higher percentage of superspreaders ( 9 % ) among 244 symptomatic cases compared to asymptomatic cases ( 79 % and 4 % , respectively ) . Compared to 245 other age groups , individuals aged 49 – 64 years had the highest mean number of infected contacts 246 ( 1 . 2 ) , lower variance ( higher k , 0 . 43 ) , and a higher percentage of superspreaders ( 3 % ) . Data on 247 total reported contacts showed a different pattern , with a higher mean number of infected 248 .

This was accompanied by a substantially 250 higher percentage of superspreaders ( 28 % ) among individuals with > 100 total contacts compared 251 to individuals with 11 – 100 contacts ( 19 % ) or those with 0 – 10 contacts ( 2 % ) . Considering only 252 symptomatic adults with a known number of total contacts ( N = 129 ) , the percentage of 253 superspreaders was consistently smaller as the number of contacts decreased : 26 % ( 5 / 19 ) for 254 individuals with over 100 contacts , 24 % ( 8 / 34 ) for those with 21 – 100 contacts , 8 % ( 2 / 24 ) for 255 those with 11 – 20 contacts , and 0 % for those with 10 or fewer contacts ( 0 / 52 ) . 256 257 DISCUSSION 258 Superspreading is a key form of heterogeneity in transmission of numerous viruses , 259 including SARS - CoV , MERS - CoV , SARS - CoV - 2 , Nipah , Ebola , and measles [ 14 , 15 , 23 , 27 – 29 ] . 260 The potential for superspreading depends on the environment and social context of contact , as 261 well as individual biological or behavioral factors that influence infectiousness . The existing 262 literature on SARS - CoV - 2 superspreading has done little to disaggregate this phenomenon into 263 the distinct contributions of environment and individual characteristics . 264 Our ranking of event types by attack rate reinforces our existing understanding of SARS - 265 CoV - 2 and other pathogens that transmit through the air , that transmission is more likely in 266 dense indoor gatherings or close and frequent contact among co - living individuals , especially in 267 households [ 9 ] . Published meta - analyses covering the early pandemic ( pre - 2021 ) estimated 268 pooled household secondary attack rates of 17 – 21 % [ 10 , 12 , 13 , 30 , 31 ] , with household attack 269 rates consistently higher than those in healthcare , work , or travel settings [ 10 , 13 ] . Our pooled 270 household secondary attack rate over 115 events was 29 % , higher than these earlier studies but 271 .

[ 12 ] for studies covering July 2020 to March 272 2021 . The higher value may be explained by the emergence of the Alpha and Delta variants and 273 the larger second and third waves of the pandemic occurring in some countries during 2021 . 274 The literature on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission events rarely reported on the 275 epidemiological context and characteristics of different populations exposed , which could help 276 explain variation in attack rates . While the timing and location of events may help to explain 277 some of the variation within event types , the remaining variation could depend on event duration 278 ( as shown by Supplementary Figure S5 ) and time spent indoors , types of activities occurring 279 ( e . g . , exercise , singing ) [ 32 , 33 ] , varying interventions in place ( e . g . masking requirements , 280 physical distancing ) , and the age groups present at the event . For example , the age of individuals 281 interacting in these contexts appears to also influence propensity for transmission , as evidenced 282 by the large difference in attack rates within schools versus nursing homes . Children and 283 adolescents are frequently found to have lower household infection risk than working age adults 284 [ 12 , 13 , 17 , 31 ] and older adults have higher risk of infection and severe disease than younger ages 285 [ 12 , 31 ] . In studies that assessed transmission among school - aged children , teachers , and their 286 household contacts , attack rates among children at school were lower than among teachers and 287 the household contacts of children and teachers [ 34 , 35 ] . Environmental factors such as humidity , 288 room size , ventilation , and air flow [ 5 ] could also augment transmission across settings but these 289 were very rarely reported in the literature . 290 Our results also indicate substantial heterogeneity in the infectiousness of individuals , 291 which is reflected elsewhere [ 36 – 38 ] . Analysis of index case demographics also highlights age as 292 an important factor in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and superspreading . While age was only 293 reported in 46 % of index cases , nearly all superspreading individuals were adults and there were 294 .

Presence of symptoms was reported less 295 frequently in the literature ( 10 % of papers ) , but among the cases with data , symptoms were more 296 frequent in superspreaders than in non - superspreaders . Individual and age - related heterogeneity 297 in the amount and assortative patterns of social contacts likely influence superspreading as well . 298 Evidence supports lower transmission from children compared to adults , but effect sizes have 299 been small in some studies [ 10 , 17 , 30 , 37 ] . Remaining heterogeneity in individual infectiousness 300 may derive from differences in genetic susceptibility [ 39 , 40 ] , body size ( accounting for age ) 301 [ 41 ] , baseline lung volume and function [ 38 ] , immunocompromising disease or co - infection 302 [ 42 , 43 ] , or the loudness and wetness of speech [ 32 ] . The relative importance of these 303 characteristics to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission at a population level are unknown and may be 304 challenging to measure and report at scale . Future work on COVID - 19 and other respiratory 305 diseases should address these hypotheses . 306 It is clear from our analysis that SARS - CoV - 2 exhibits pronounced individual 307 heterogeneity of infectiousness , as evidenced by the degree distribution for index cases and the 308 estimate of the dispersion parameter k . Our estimate of k ( 0 . 27 , CI : 0 . 25 – 0 . 28 ) is within the range 309 of previous estimates for a similar period of the pandemic , with values frequently in the range of 310 0 . 1 – 0 . 7 [ 3 , 14 , 15 , 24 ] . Caution should be taken when interpreting k values , which are sensitive to 311 changes in the tails of a distribution , such as superspreaders or individuals that cause no 312 secondary infections . Without robust isolated case finding and follow - up , contact tracing efforts 313 may undercount the number of zeroes , biasing k upwards [ 44 , 45 ] . Alternatively , backwards 314 contact tracing may be susceptible to attachment bias , where infections are preferentially 315 attributed to a known superspreader rather than a separate ( known or unknown ) transmitter [ 45 ] . 316 Additionally , there may be publication bias or more complete contact tracing for large outbreaks 317 .

These effects would bias k downwards . Without 318 knowledge of the relative impact of these biases , it is challenging to interpret whether k is a true 319 representation of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission heterogeneity . We recommend that contact tracing 320 efforts use both backward and forward contact tracing [ 9 , 17 , 46 ] , with sufficient follow - up time 321 to identify non - infecting individuals , and complete reporting of contact tracing efforts ( e . g . , 322 anonymized line lists with infector - infectee and other demographic information ) . 323 A prinicipal limitation of our analysis was the incomplete data available in the published 324 literature . Beyond information provided about the timing and location of events , very few studies 325 reported any demographics of the exposed individuals , their COVID - 19 vaccination status ( once 326 introduced ) or history of prior SARS - CoV - 2 infection , or the density and amount of time 327 indoors . For individual index cases , some studies reported demographic information and the 328 presence / absence of symptoms , but this atypical . We also experienced difficulty with deducing 329 whether contact tracing was performed for all reported cases in transmission chains , especially 330 for terminal nodes . It was not always clear whether cases did not transmit or whether data were 331 missing due to lack of contact tracing , so these cases had to be omitted from the analysis . To 332 improve the field and our understanding of the drivers of heterogeneity in transmission , we 333 propose standard and consistent reporting on transmission for all outbreaks , as feasible , including 334 details on the epidemiological context of transmission and complete line lists of cases following 335 contact tracing , with information on case demographics ( age , sex , occupation ) , diagnosis 336 ( presence / absence of symptoms , symptom description , test date and results ) , the duration of 337 contact tracing , and the total number of contacts and the demographic information for contacts 338 ( see Appendix 2 ) . Details on the duration of contact tracing should include the entire time period 339 of case finding and how long cases were followed to detect any secondary cases . We recognize 340 .

However , 342 developing such a reporting system should be a priority for public health as the information has 343 important inplications for reducing the spread of infectious pathogens . 344 Another limitation of this review was the wide variation in case detection methods across 345 studies . Some studies reported only symptomatic cases or only performed diagnostic tests ( e . g . , 346 PCR ) on symptomatic individuals , thereby missing all reporting of asymptomatic or 347 pausisymptomatic individuals and any secondary cases produced . Therefore , some of the event 348 secondary attack rates , meta - analysis estimates , and individual case degree distributions are 349 likely underestimates . However , we have no reason to believe that these biases in case 350 ascertainment would vary across different event types / settings or demographic characteristics of 351 index cases . The rankings of event types by secondary attack rate from our meta - analysis and the 352 differential characteristics of superspreaders we observed are likely robust to these issues of 353 ascertainment , but there is additional work needed to measure these effects . Furthermore , clinical 354 cases , which were less likely to be missed , are more important as public health outcomes and 355 more likely to be implicated in transmission . 356 Despite these limitations , this review found substantial heterogeneity in the transmission 357 of SARS - CoV - 2 , highlighting the settings and individual characteristics that might be most 358 important to target for controlling superspreading . Secondary attack rates were highest in co - 359 living situations where prolonged contact between individuals facilitated transmission , though 360 there was substantial variation in attack rates within similar settings that remained unexplained . 361 Given the moderate attack rates among minors in school and the rarity of children among 362 superspreaders , interventions targeting these age groups may be less efficient at preventing 363 .

Our review only covered the first phase of the pandemic , so important questions remain 368 about whether patterns in attack rates and individual - level transmission still apply to later 369 pandemic phases with significant population - level immunity .
