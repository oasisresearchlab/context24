In the case of shearing forces , such as when individual cells encounter interstitial shear stress and blood shear stress , mechanotransduction involves mechanical stretching and spatial recon ﬁ guration of Filamin A ( FLNa ) binding sites and subsequent release of FilGAP molecules normally bound to FLNa . However , the connection and importance of downstream molecular effectors and cellular metrics involved in response to shear stress are not understood . Here we reveal mechano - sensitive GTPase - mediated changes in cell contractility . By varying expression of FilGAP , and expression of FLNa , we show that micro ﬂ uidic shear stress results in cell contractile changes only when FilGAP and FLNa dynamically bind and dissociate . By using FRET sensors that quantify the Rho or Rac charge state , we demonstrate that only cells with dynamic FLNa and FilGAP convert shear stress into GTPase activity , and the resulting downstream contractile changes . Finally , we show that manipulation of Rho and Rac through pharmacological means rescues the contractile activity , in the absence of intact FLNa - FilGAP mechanosensing . This research clari ﬁ es a precise mechanomolecular pathway used for cellular force sensing and may play critical roles in human health challenges from cancer metastasis to cardiovascular disease .

In the vascular system , shear stress on the order of 1Pa caused by blood and lymph ﬂ ow has been shown to regulate vasodilation and blood pressure , modulate the development and adaptation of vascular beds , and contribute to the remodeling of blood vessels [ 2 – 4 ] .

Shear stress has been shown to cause cytoskeletal ﬁ lament reorganization and stiffening of the cytoskeleton [ 3 ] . The ability of cells to actively respond to these mechanical forces is essential for cell homeostasis and ﬁ tness , with aberrant behavior contributing to pathology . For example , mechanical sensors and their downstream signaling factors are implicated in the regulation of cardiac contractile dysfunction and diastolic heart disease [ 5 ] . Shear stress in particular has also been shown to promote migration of breast cancer cells [ 1 ] . While mechanosensing has clear roles in physiology and pathology , the precise sensing mechanisms at the cellular level that regulate responses have remained unclear . In general , physical forces deform diverse intracellular structures , converting these mechanical stimuli into biochemical signals through a process broadly known as mechanotransduction [ 6 ] . The ability of cells to continuously detect and actively respond to these mechanical forces is mediated by an emerging group of specialized molecules called mechanosensors [ 7 , 8 ] . In addition to speci ﬁ c structures such as stretch activated channels , the cytoskeleton itself is ideally poised to be a mechanosensor , as it is the principal generator of cellular forces , and the mechanical conductor of stress and strain [ 9 ] . One molecular mechanotransduction mechanism for shear stress involves the actin - binding protein Filamin A ( FLNa ) . FLNa is a homodimer protein that plays important roles in cell structure and mechanosensation . FLNa is made up of an actin binding domain ( ABD ) and 24 repeat immunoglobulin - like domains ( IGD ) . It can be classi ﬁ ed into three sections , rod 1 ( IGD 1 – 15 ) , rod 2 ( IGD 15 – 23 ) , and a dimerization domain in IGD24 [ 10 ] . Via its ABD , FLNa crosslinks and anchors actin ﬁ laments to stabilize the plasma membrane , provide cellular cortical rigidity , and contribute to the mechanical stability of the cell [ 10 ] . FLNa also directs the formation of dynamic actin stress ﬁ bers to contribute to the shape and movement of the cell [ 11 , 12 ] . Beyond its role in regulating cell structure , FLNa also forms diverse interactions with other proteins to serve as a versatile signaling scaffold . As such , FLNa may integrate external physical forces such as shear to elicit speci ﬁ c cellular responses . Prior work has shown that FLNa is recruited to the cell cortex in response to shear stress exposure [ 1 ] . The properties of the F - actin network are also dependent on the concentrations of FLNa [ 8 , 13 ] . In response to shear force , it has been observed that F - actin networks soften at low FLNa concentrations and strain - harden at high FLNa concentrations [ 13 ] . FLNa has also been shown to play a role in tumorigenesis : in cancer cells , researchers have observed abnormal expression and subcellular localization of FLNa , suggesting it in ﬂ uences cytoskeleton rearrangement , migration , proliferation , and signal transduction in tumor cells [ 11 ] . For example , Filamin A - de ﬁ cient human melanoma M2 cells have adhesion , motility and migration related defects and are softer than other melanoma cell lines that express FLNa [ 14 – 16 ] . Critically , M2 cells are insensitive to mechanical stimuli , strongly implicating FLNa as an essential mechanosensor , however , the details of this interaction have remained unclear . Shear stress subjects the intracellular actin network to strain and deformations at the molecular level of actin associated proteins , including FLNa . It is hypothesized that as forces deform the actin cytoskeleton , FLNa ’ s rod2 domain undergoes conformational changes to expose cryptic binding sites for signaling proteins . This changes FLNa ’ s binding af ﬁ nity for other proteins to regulate many cellular functions including motility , maintenance of cell shape , and differentiation [ 10 ] . Filamin ’ s mechanism of mechanotransduction regulation may be linked to the more than 100 unique binding partners including integrins , kinases , and GTPases [ 12 , 17 ] . One speci ﬁ c GTPase activating protein ( GAP ) , FilGAP , appears to play a key role in mediating FLNa ’ s ability to respond to shear stress . Like other GTPases , Rac and Rho are regulated by GEFs and GAPs , which directly modulate the charge state of Rac and Rho [ 18 – 20 ] . FilGAP is a GAP that binds FLNa [ 21 ] . Nakamura and collaborators [ 22 ] have previously identi ﬁ ed the binding sites that facilitate the FLNa - FilGAP interaction . Using biochemical assays , they identi ﬁ ed that residues 723 – 726 in the coiled coil domain of FilGAP bind to the 23 rd immunoglobulin like domain of FLNa ( IGD23 ) . Inducing a point mutation ( M2474E ) into IGD23 of FLNa is suf ﬁ cient to abolish the FilGAP - FLNa interaction , thus FLNa M2474E does not form complexes with FilGAP . The conformation of FLNa ’ s rod2 domain also modulates the FLNa - FilGAP interaction . Upon force generation , the rod2 domain of FLNa is deformed , reducing FLNa ’ s binding af ﬁ nity for FilGAP , and allowing the recruitment of FilGAP to the sites of membrane protrusion and force transfer where it interacts with Rac [ 12 , 23 ] . At these sites , FilGAP antagonizes Rac activity to inhibit cell spreading and lamellae formation , and disruptions in the FLNa - FilGAP interaction can lead to increased force - induced apoptosis [ 13 ] . This suggests that the force - induced recruitment of FLNa and FilGAP to the cell periphery contributes to mechanoprotection [ 12 , 24 ] . Several key studies from McCulloch have identi ﬁ ed the mechanoprotective nature of FilGAP and FLNa in force mediated apoptosis , demonstrating broad importance of this mechanotransduction interaction [ 24 – 26 ] . FilGAP has also been shown to regulate tumor progression in glioblastoma , astrocytoma , carcinoma , and breast cancers [ 21 , 27 – 29 ] . FilGAP promotes the mesenchymal to amoeboid transition in tumorigenesis and regulates the front - rear polarity of migrating tumor cells [ 28 , 29 ] . FilGAP is thus poised to be an effective mechanosensor by regulating the relative levels of Rho and Rac activity . FilGAP directly deactivates Rac as a GAP which indirectly leads to Rho activation [ 21 , 29 , 30 ] . While novel upstream mechanosensors are being discovered in diverse contexts , the downstream balance of Rac and Rho activities appears to be a commonly employed biochemical switch that changes cytoskeletal activity , and in turn determines cell morphology and behavior [ 20 ] . Rac and Rho belong to the family of GTPases that regulate numerous cellular processes including actin polymerization and cell signalling [ 31 ] . The spatiotemporal coordination of Rac and Rho activity mediates cellular migration by directing the formation and organization of actin ﬁ laments . In studies using GTPase biosensors , Rho activation was observed at the leading edge of migrating cells whereas Rac activation occurred afterwards and further away from the edge , suggesting that Rho may initiate membrane protrusion Frontiers in Physics | www . frontiersin . org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 890865 2 Bergeron - Sandoval et al . Dynamic FLNa FilGAP Shear Mechanosensing whereas Rac could promote the reinforcement and stabilization of newly formed protrusions [ 32 ] . In contradiction , another study using GTPase biosensors found that in neutrophils Rho is absent from protrusions [ 33 ] . Rac and Rho signaling also regulate the cell cycle by promoting progression through the G1 checkpoint and the formation of the mitotic spindle [ 31 ] . As Rho and Rac regulate cellular migration and proliferation , the dysregulation of their signaling may promote tumorigenesis and metastasis [ 34 ] . Although FilGAP ’ s biochemical properties and role in cancer pathogenesis have been examined , the acute responses of FilGAP activity on biophysical activity of the cell , such as contractility under mechanical stimuli , have remained unclear . Speci ﬁ cally , the environmental factors that modulate cellular responses to shear stress and the characterization of Rho and Rac GTPase in contractile response to shear stress have yet to be examined . Resolving the contractile response to mechanical stimuli would thus offer a closed loop understanding of how cells physically react to changes in their environment and tune their behavior accordingly . Here we used traction force microscopy ( TFM ) and Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) to reveal that FLNa expression and dynamic FLNa - FilGAP interaction are essential for cellular response to shear stress . Using FLNa de ﬁ cient cells , FLNa M2474E mutants ( lacking the FilGAP binding domain ) , and siRNA FilGAP gene knockdown , we show that dynamic FLNa - FilGAP interactions are required to detect shear , and regulate the spatiotemporal modulation of GTPase activity , which in turn induces changes in cell contractility . By con ﬁ ning cells to ﬁ bronectin micropatterns , we modulated the effective shear impinging on cells , and demonstrated that cell pro ﬁ le and cell orientation to ﬂ ow determine the timing of the cellular response . Lastly , we demonstrate the Rho pathway conservation by rescuing cell contractility through pharmacological Rho activation in cells with inhibited FLNa - FilGAP interactions . Our results cumulatively suggest that the amount of cell strain modulates the amount of FilGAP released by FLNa into the cytosol . This unbound FilGAP regulates the activity levels of RhoGTPases , and the resulting contractile response , with diverse physiological and pathological consequences . RESULTS We fabricated laminar ﬂ ow micro ﬂ uidic shear in combination with a deformable compliant lower cell substrate , allowing us to apply precisely controlled shear stress , while quantifying cell contractility using Traction Force Microscopy [ 35 ] , and GTPase activity with quantitative FRET ( see methods ) . Using this micro ﬂ uidic device ( Suppplementary Figure S1A ) , we imposed a 5 min ﬂ ow of shear stress onto cells . We observed that FLNa expressing A7 cells display a reversible increase in contractile work ( strain energy ) in response to shear ( Figure 1B ) . A characteristic time delay is observed for this contractile response , and cell strain energy comes back to original levels after the peak response . In FLNa - de ﬁ cient M2 cells , no contractile response to shear stress is observed ( Figure 1B ) . Dynamic FLNa - FilGAP Interaction is Required for Shear Mechanosensing To understand FLNa - dependent mechanosensing , we explored the physical and molecular underpinnings of this response within a population of Filamin A - complemented melanoma cells . We ﬁ rst explored the importance of the FLNa - FilGAP interaction in the cell response to shear force and assessed the impact of FLNa expression levels on shear mechanotransduction . While FLNa - de ﬁ cient M2 cells displayed no mechanostimulation , transient FLNa complementation in M2 cells showed a partial recovery by demonstrating cell contractile work under shear ( Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S2 ) . We next introduced a FLNa variant ( M2474E mutation ) into the M2 cells ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) which has been shown to functionally crosslink actin and interact with other FLNa binding partners but lacks the binding site for FilGAP on Ig repeat 23 [ 22 ] . We observed that M2474E M2 cells are unresponsive to the applied shear stress compared to the FLNa rescue ( Figure 1C ) , suggesting that FLNa ’ s binding with FilGAP is essential for mechanotransduction . To examine if this disruption is only sensitive to changes in FLNa , we then suppressed FilGAP expression using siRNA in A7 cells ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) , which stably express FLNa . Cells expressing WT FLNa with downregulated FilGAP were unresponsive to external shear stress similar to cells which do not express FLNa ( Figures 1C , D ) . Together these results demonstrate that both FLNa and FilGAP expression are necessary but not suf ﬁ cient for mechanosensing , and that dynamic binary binding interactions are required for mechanosensing of shear stress . Cell Contractile Response is Modulated by Cell Prestress and Shear Flow Magnitude On the basis that cell mechanoresponse also depends on environmental factors , we next set out to determine how shear stress magnitude and substrate stiffness in ﬂ uence contractile response . We exposed single cells to a range of shear stress from 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 Pa ; as before , no response in FLNa de ﬁ cient M2 cells was observed , however , in the FLNa expressing A7 cell we observed an increase in contractile work as a function of applied shear stress ( Figures 2A , B ) . To determine whether substrate material properties can impact the timing of cell response to shear , we ﬁ rst measured cell strain energy in response to a burst of shear in A7 cells in the main text KPa is used , in the Figure 2C kPa grown on PDMS substrates with a stiffness of either 10 KPa or 25 KPa . We observed that on average , cells grown on a stiffer substrate have a higher pre - shear strain energy and see a linear relationship between the prestress in the cell and the peak contractile strain energy after application of shear stress ( Figure 2C ) . Since stiffer cells will deform less under an applied shear , our data suggests that cell strain is a more determinant factor than physical stress ( i . e . , force per area ) in the cell contractile response .

Dynamic FLNa FilGAP Shear Mechanosensing Contractile Response Timing is Driven by Total Shear Force The challenges of imposing varied ﬂ ow rates within a single device prompted us to approach the question of varied shear force using other means , and we thus considered the varied cross - sections of cells exposed to the same shear ﬂ ow to determine their individual shear forces . Using substrates of low and high stiffness , we observed similar heterogeneity for A7 cells to reach peak contractile response to shear ( Figure 3A ) . Time lapse traction force microscopy at the population level also reveals an unexpected heterogeneity in peak response lag of A7 cells exposed to shear stress ( Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S3 ) , suggesting that additional factors beyond substrate stiffness and applied stress determine response delay . We used this heterogeneity to probe the cell response to shear under constant shear regimes . Since the effective shear force is a function of cell surface exposed to ﬂ ow , we next determined if cell shape and geometry in ﬂ uence the timing of cell response to shear in a force dependent manner . We ﬁ rst quanti ﬁ ed the pro ﬁ le and aspect ratio of cells exposed to shear and measured the cell contractile work . We observed that cells with lower aspect ratios respond faster than cells with higher aspect ratios ( Figure 3B ) . As prior work has demonstrated that increased cell spreading ﬂ attens cells [ 36 ] , our result suggests that A7 cells with low aspect ratio have a round and high pro ﬁ le . A high pro ﬁ le increases the cell cross - section exposed to the shear ﬂ ow , resulting in a higher effective total shear force . Cells with high aspect ratio are also generally ﬂ atter and stiffer [ 36 ] , and thus would be deformed less under the same applied stress . Another factor that may in ﬂ uence the amount of cell surface exposed to shear ﬂ ow is cellular orientation . We also calculated the impact of the cell major axis orientation to the shear ﬂ ow on the effective shear force ( Figure 3C ) . Using this approach , we noticed that randomly seeded cells exposed to a higher effective shear force have a shorter response lag than cells subject to low effective shear force ( Figure 3D ) . We ﬁ nd an inverse linear relationship between contractile response lag and magnitude of shear stress .

Dynamic FLNa FilGAP Shear Mechanosensing Strain Heterogeneity is Regulated by Prestress and Cell Orientation To examine more closely how cell geometry and cell orientation in ﬂ uence the cellular response to shear , we used ﬁ bronectin - coated micropatterns on PDMS substrates to con ﬁ ne cells into ﬁ xed aspect ratios and orientations to shear ﬂ ow , where each pattern dictates the cell spreading ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) . We also determined that cell height is inversely proportional to the aspect ratio determined by cell adhesion on the ﬁ bronectin micropatterns ( Supplementary Figure S4D ) . Our TFM results on micropatterns show that the contractile response delay is also inversely proportional to the effective shear determined by the cell aspect ratio and orientation to ﬂ ow ( Figure 3D ) . This suggests that larger cell strains initiate faster contractile responses . Our data reinforces the idea that as forces deform the actin cytoskeleton , FLNa undergoes conformational changes to expose cryptic binding sites for signaling proteins implicated in mechanotransduction . Since dynamic binary binding interactions are required for mechanosensing , our results suggest that mechanical release of FilGAP under strain is a key step in FLNa - dependent mechanotransduction . Strain Heterogeneity Triggers GTPase Rate Heterogeneity Based on these observations , we next quanti ﬁ ed FLNa - dependent mechanotransduction by probing the activity of intracellular Rac or Rho sensors . FilGAP is released from its FLNa - bound state when the cell actin network is under shear strain , making FilGAP then available to interact with and inhibit Rac [ 21 ] . The reduction in Rac activity under shear could increase the activity of the Rho pathway that stimulates actomyosin contraction [ 37 ] . To test this , we complemented cell contractility measurements with intracellular FRET - based sensors that report the charge state of Rac or Rho . We used FRET sensors that speci ﬁ cally detect either Rac ( Raichu - Rac1 ) , RhoA or RhoB activity throughout the cell [ 38 , 39 ] . Using a custom parallel - plate shear stress device ( Supplementary Figures S1B – C ) and the RhoA2G FRET sensor [ 40 ] , we observed increased RhoA activity at the cell leading edge when cells that express FLNa are exposed to shear stress , while RhoA activity in FLNa - null cells remains unaffected by shear ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . Modulation of Rho activity in time after cells are exposed to shear in a micro ﬂ uidic device ( Supplementary Figure S1A ) reveals a peak of activity compared to prestress or recovery levels ( Figure 4A ) . We next performed simultaneous time - lapse analysis of traction forces , pattern deformation and Rho ( DORA - RhoB sensor ) activity in single cells grown on micropatterns . When cells are exposed to shear stress , we measured an increase in both cell contractility and Rho activity in FLNa complemented A7 cells ( Figure 4B ) . In contrast , we observed no changes in cell contractility nor DORA - RhoB sensor activity in A7 cells in the absence of shear . FLNa de ﬁ cient M2 cells show no contractile response nor RhoB activation under shear regardless of cell height or orientation to ﬂ ow ( Supplementary Figure S6A ) . We also see that Rho activation speed is correlated with the magnitude of Rho signal change ( Figure 4C ) . This trend is more noticeable under a high shear regime and suggests that Rho activity is strain dependent . We indeed observed that the DORA - RhoB sensor YFP / CFP ratio is signi ﬁ cantly higher in cells exposed to an applied shear of 2 . 5 Pa compared to 0 . 5 Pa ( Figure 4D ) . A proportional relationship between YFP / CFP ratio and shear is observed when we converted the applied shear into effective force ( Figure 4E ) as determined by the incident angle of ﬂ ow to the cell major axis and the cell aspect ratio . These results show that Rho activation is correlated with applied shear and effective shear force , and that Rho activity is modulated by strain . GTPase - dependent Mechanointegration of Shear - Mediated Cell Contractility We next probed the landscape of cell contractility as a function of Rho activity to better understand how the magnitude of GTPase FIGURE3 | Cellgeometry , materialpropertiesandorientationtoshear ﬂ owcontributetothetimingofcellcontractileresponsetoshear ﬂ ow ( A ) Boxplot ( centerline , median ; box , upperandlowerquartiles ; whiskers , 1 . 5xIQR ; crosses , outliers ; two - sided t - test p = 0 . 215 ) ofpeakcontractileresponselag ( min ) toshear ( 5min , 0 . 5 Pa ) in A7cellsculturedon10 KPa ( n = 15cells ) or25 KPa ( n = 11cells ) PDMSsubstrates ( B ) Peakcontractileresponse lag ( min ) toshear ( 5 minat0 . 5 Pa ) inrandomlyseeded A7cellsasafunctionofcellaspectratioon10 KPa ( n = 15cells ) or25 KPa ( n = 11cells ; dashedline , linearleastsquares ﬁ t ) ( C ) Incidentangle ( θ ) ofshear ﬂ owtocell major axis determines the effective force = sin ( θ ) x applied shear .

Dynamic FLNa FilGAP Shear Mechanosensing signaling is coupled to actomyosin contraction . We used the time - dependent contractile response and GTPase biosensor ratios as readouts of population states . We observed that strain energy increase in A7 cells depends on Rho activation whereas Rho magnitude ﬂ uctuations are independent of the cell contractile work ( Figure 5A ) . Our data suggests that while Rho is required to drive contractility it can also be decoupled from the cell contractile response . Rho is thus necessary but not suf ﬁ cient for mechanoresponse . When we compared the integration of Rho sensor activity in A7 cells that respond to shear , we also observed that a characteristic threshold of total Rho activity is required for the cell to contract ( Figure 5B ) . Together these results suggest that while cells need to integrate Rho activity up to a certain threshold for cell contraction , Rho activation is not a reliable predictor of a contractile response to shear . This is expected as Rho signaling regulates a number of different intracellular processes , but it also suggests that other molecular players are involved in regulating Rho - dependent shear mechanotransduction . Our observations further support the existence of contractile checkpoints that participate in the integration of external mechanical stimuli and to the overall contractile response heterogeneity . Based on our molecular , traction and FRET data , we propose a contractile mechanism that hinges on the release and activation of FilGAP for direct inactivation of Rac and indirect activation of Rho . We next designed a pharmacological assay to con ﬁ rm this idea and to control Rho and Rac activity with speci ﬁ c inhibitors to circumvent the absence of FLNa and trigger a contractile response in M2 cells . We successfully simulated contraction in FLNa - de ﬁ cient M2 cells by combining the Rac inhibitor Ehop - 16 ( 20 uM ) [ 41 ] and the Rho agonist nocodazole ( 10 uM ) [ 42 ] to stimulate the GTPase response and cell contraction ( Figures 5C – F ) . We also reversed the GTPase and contractile responses with ROCK - inhibitor Y - 27632 ( 10 uM ) treatment ( Figures 5C , D ) . These results suggest that reversible contractile work is driven by modulations in the respective Rho and Rac activity levels . To con ﬁ rm that decrease of Rac activity coupled with increase of Rho activity leads to contraction , we used the same pharmacological treatment to recreate the impact of FilGAP release and activation that we observe in A7 cells under strain ( Figure 5D ) . As expected , we observed an initial increase in cell traction after treatment with the combined Rac inhibitor Ehop - 16 ( 20 uM ) and the Rho agonist nocodazole ( 10 uM ) ( Figure 5F ) . We also quanti ﬁ ed a subsequent decrease in traction after the same cell was treated with the ROCK - inhibitor Y - 27632 ( 10 uM ) ( Figure 5F ) . These observations show that other drug - induced mechanoeffectors remain functional in this M2 cell in absence of FLNa . Together our results con ﬁ rm that shear mechanotransduction in melanoma cells is mediated by dynamic binding of FLNa and FilGAP ( Figures 1 , 2 ) , the cell strain ( Figures 3 , 4 ) and the modulation of Rac and Rho activities ( Figures 4 , 5 ) . DISCUSSION Mechanosensing must integrate a broad range of stimuli and draws upon diverse mechanisms . Depending on cellular and environmental context , various mechanocomplexes act as direct shear force sensors such as the Plexin D1 - neuropilin 1 - VEGFR system in endothelial cells [ 43 ] or the FLNa - FilGAP system [ 24 ] we studied here in melanoma cells . Mechanotransduction through the FLNa - FilGAP sensor depends on common molecular players including integrins and small GTPase . Force - dependent activation of integrins and GTPase is also a feature shared with the PECAM - 1 system in endothelial cells [ 44 ] . As a mechanointegrator , the FLNa - FilGAP system convolves a broad range of stimuli and produces a breadth of responses . We FIGURE 4 | Rho response is faster and of higher magnitude under high strain ( A ) An A7 cell stably expressing DORA - RhoB sensor on a ﬁ bronectin micropattern ( white outlines ; 2 : 1 aspect ratio rectangle , 1 , 000 micron 2 ) was exposed to shear ﬂ ow to quantify prestress ( top ) , peak ( middle ) and recovery ( bottom ) levels of DORA - RhoB activity ( left panels ) .

Dynamic FLNa FilGAP Shear Mechanosensing observed that the delay of contractile response to shear could be predicted by the effective shear force applied to cells . Effective shear force is the deformation of cells due to shear force and is determined by cellular orientation to ﬂ uid ﬂ ow and height of cell pro ﬁ le . This may represent a “ bet - hedging ” strategy used by cells to optimize the timing and magnitude of their shear response .

Dynamic FLNa FilGAP Shear Mechanosensing mediated mechanosensing may use this strategy to tune their response to ﬂ uctuations in shear stress in order to maintain ﬁ tness . Indeed , we have shown that identical shear stress elicits diverse magnitudes and timing of the response ; we attribute this to the varied actual resulting strain based on cell stiffness , and effective shear force . Thus , this sensitivity variation based on cell to cell geometry and alignment differences allows a collection of cells to process a broader dynamic range of stimuli than possible for a single cell ’ s random orientation of FLNa networks [ 45 ] . Evidence for a smaller dynamic range of contractility in FLNa - complemented M2 cells re ﬂ ect the importance of protein expression levels and amount of sequestered FilGAP through dynamic binding in response heterogeneity . Surprisingly , no difference in baseline Raichu - Rac activity was observed between A7 and M2 cells whereas DORA - RhoB signal is higher in M2 cells compared to A7 cells ( Supplementary Figure S7 ) suggesting the existence of a feedback mechanism to control GTPases levels when the FLNa - FilGAP dynamic interaction is broken and only unbound FilGAP is present in M2 cells . FilGAP is inactive in the bound state and active in unbound state ; as a result , the change in GTPase activity and contractile shear response is dampened in absence of FLNa . FilGAP ’ s mechanosensory role likely has broad relevance in cancer metastasis . Small GTPases have been shown to play extensive roles in regulating apical & basal polarity of individual cells , but are also crucial to regulate collective multicellular migration and fragmentation [ 46 ] . In metastatic tumor invasion FilGAP regulates polarity of breast cancer cells leading to increased migration penetration [ 28 ] . Future work will continue to resolve the extent of FilGAP mechanotransduction in diverse physiology and pathology . MATERIALS AND METHODS Fabrication of Soft Silicone Substrates Compliant polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) substrates were prepared as described by Yoshie and colleagues [ 47 ] . We obtained substrates of different modulus by mixing an equal weight ratio of PDMS components A and B ( NuSil ® 8100 , NuSil Silicone Technologies ) with respective concentrations of dimethyl siloxane - methyl hydrogen siloxane copolymer ( Sylgard 184 , NuSil Silicone Technologies ) that effectively crosslink the PDMS . We measured with a parallel plate rheometer ( Anton Paar MCR302 ) that PDMS substrates with weight percentage concentrations of Sylgard 184 of 0 . 20 , 0 . 36 and 0 . 50 have Young ’ s moduli of 5 . 0 ± 0 . 04 , 12 . 0 ± 0 . 71 , and 23 . 4 ± 1 . 86 kPa respectively . We laminated two layers of PDMS on 1 . 0 mm thick glass slides ( 75 × 25 mm , VWR ) to obtain a uniform thickness of ~ 150 microns . For each layer , 0 . 75 ml of PDMS solution were spin coated ( WS - 650 , Laurell Technologies ) at 500 rpm for 1 min and cured at 100 ° C for 1 h . An additional PDMS layer with ﬁ duciary beads was added at 2000 rpm for 1 min and cured 1 h for our traction force microscopy experiments . Substrate surfaces were functionalized with sulfo - sanpah exposed to under UV for 2 min , washed with phosphate buffered saline and incubated with ﬁ bronectin for 1 h . Printing of Fibronectin Micropatterns for Controlled Cell Attachment PDMS substrates were micropatterned with a UV - patterning system as described by Ghagre and collaborators [ 48 ] . PDMS substrates were incubated with 5 mg / ml poly - L - lysine ( Sigma ) for 30 min , washed with miliQ water and treated with 10 mg / ml polyethylene glycol valeric acid ( Laysan Bio ) in 0 . 1 M HEPES pH8 . 5 for 30 min . Substrates were then washed with phosphate buffered saline , covered with UV sensitive photo initiator solution ( Alveole Lab ) and exposed for 30 s to a patterned 29 mW / mm 2 375 nm UV laser with a Primo unit ( Alveole Lab ) mounted on a Ti2 eclipse microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with a 20x / 0 . 45NA objective ( Nikon ) . After the UV - based micropatterning step , the substrates were washed with phosphate buffered saline and incubated with 40 μ g / ml ﬁ bronectin 5 μ g / ml Alexa - 555 - labelled bovine serum albumin solution for 1 h . Substrates were ﬁ nally washed with phosphate buffered saline and stored at 4 ° C prior to cell seeding . Plasmid Preparation mEmerald - FilaminA - N - 9 plasmid ( Addgene ) was used to generate mEmerald - FilaminA M2474E using the GeneArt site - directed mutagenesis system ( Thermo ) . Plasmid stocks were prepared by transforming One Shot ™ TOP10 ( Thermo ) chemically competent E . coli cells , with a transformation ef ﬁ ciency of ~ 10 9 cfu / μ g plasmid DNA and performing an overnight bacterial culture on kanamycin ( 50 μ g / ml ) LB Petri plates . Colonies were selected on the petri plates , and inoculation of liquid bacterial culture was done overnight in shaking incubator at 37 ° C . DNA was puri ﬁ ed with QIAprep ® Spin Miniprep Kit ( Qiagen ) and DNA was quanti ﬁ ed with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer ( Thermo ) . Cell Culture , Seeding and Transfection The human melanoma cell lines M2 and A7 cell lines were maintained in DMEM with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin streptomycin antibiotics . Media for A7 cell lines complemented for ﬁ laminA expression also contained G418 . Cell lines in ﬁ ltered ﬂ asks were incubated at 37 ° C with 5 % CO 2 . Cells were seeded and incubated on ﬁ bronectin coated substrates or micropatterns for 1 h and washed with phosphate buffered saline to avoid nonspeci ﬁ c adhesion . Cell lines were otherwise plated onto a 6 - well plate for transfection purposes . M2 cells were transfected with FLNa and FLNa M2474E using the GenJet ™ DNA In Vitro Tranfection Reagent ( SignaGen Laboratories ) . Cell lines with no ﬂ uorescent labels were dyed with CellTracker Green CMFDA ( Invitrogen ) for confocal microscopy purposes . Stable cell lines that respectively express the FRET sensors DORA - RhoB [ 38 ] and Raichu - Rac [ 39 , 49 ] were generated using lentiviral transduction followed by Blasticidin selection , with codon - optimized ﬂ uorophores that prevent unwanted recombination during lentiviral gene transfer . RNA Interference Experiments Cells were transfected with control siRNA or siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes targeting human ARHGAP24 ( siRNA ID 148940 , Frontiers in Physics | www . frontiersin . org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 890865 8 Bergeron - Sandoval et al . Dynamic FLNa FilGAP Shear Mechanosensing Thermo ) using Lipofectamine ® RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent ( Thermo ) and cultured on plastic plates for 48 h . Alternatively , cells were stably transfected with a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) against FLNa and grown in the presence of 1 g / ml puromycin . Protein Extraction and Western Blot Protein extraction was performed 48 h after transfection by cell lysis with ice - cold cell lysis RIPA Buffer and protein extraction protocol . Extracted proteins were stored in microcentrifuge tubes at - 20 ° C . SDS - PAGE was performed using 4 – 15 % Mini - PROTEAN ® TGX TM precast gels ( Bio - Rad ) and the Mini - PROTEAN Tetra cell system ( Bio - Rad ) gel electrophoresis apparatus . 4X Laemmli sample buffer ( Bio - Rad ) was used as loading buffer . Blotting was done using the Trans - Blot ® Turbo system and cassettes ( Bio - Rad ) . Membranes were blocked with 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) solution and primary antibody staining was performed with either 1 : 1 , 000 Filamin A monoclonal antibody ( FLMN01 ( PM6 / 317 ) , Thermo ) or 1 : 1 , 000 polyclonal mouse anti - human ARHGAP24 antibody ( LS - C306327 , LSBio ) or 1 : 5 , 000 actin monoclonal antibody ( mAbGEa , Thermo ) in 1 % BSA . Secondary antibody staining was done with 1 : 1 , 000 goat anti - mouse IgG ( H + L ) - HRP conjugate ( 1 , 706 , 516 , Bio - Rad ) in 1 % BSA and imaging is done using the ChemiDoc Imaging System ( Thermo ) . Results are processed using Image Lab Software ( Bio - Rad ) and ImageJ ( NIH ) . Confocal Microscopy Cells on PDMS substrates were imaged on a TCS SP8 confocal microscope ( Leica ) equipped with a 10X / 0 . 4NA objective ( Leica ) in a controlled culture environment at 37 ° C perfused with a 5 % CO 2 . We used a live cell imaging solution ( Molecular Probes ) for acquisition of all the ﬂ uorescence images . Pharmalogical Treatments For the FRET experiments we stimulated Rho activity with 5uM Nocodazole ( Sigma Aldrich ) . We also used 10 µM Y - 27632 ( Sigma Aldrich ) ROCK inhibitor to reduce RhoB activity . We inhibited Rac activity with 20 µM Ehop - 16 ( Sigma Aldrich ) . Micro ﬂ uidics Setup Shear ﬂ ow was applied with a μ - Slide micro ﬂ uidic system ( Ibidi ) perfused with a syringe pump ( Harvard Apparatus ) . μ - Slides with a channel height of 600 μ m were glued over cells mounted on PDMS substrates before confocal imaging on a TCS SP8 confocal microscope and mechanical stimulation of cells unless mentioned otherwise . Rheoconfocal Setup We developed a customized rheometer - confocal platform to investigate the mechanical interplay between cells and shear stress . We combined a parallel plate rheometer ( Anton Paar MCR302 ) over aTCSSP8 confocalmicroscope equipped witha10X / 0 . 4NAobjective ( Leica ) to image cells transfected with pTriExRhoA2G ( Addgene ) . Used for Supplementary Figure S5 only . Sample ﬂ uorescence and interference re ﬂ ection microscopy imaging was performed through a customized metal cup with a heating element and infused with 5 % CO 2 ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Live - Cell FRET Measurements Cells mounted on PDMS substrates were stimulated and / or exposed to shear when indicated . Live - cell FRET imaging was performed on a TCS SP8 confocal microscope ( Leica ) equipped with a 10X / 0 . 4NA objective ( Leica ) . CFP was excited with a continuous wave 448 nm laser and excitation ﬁ lter . Simultaneous detection of CFP ( 455 – 505 nm ) and YFP ( 520 – 600 nm ) channels was performed with two respective photomultiplier tubes . Images were acquired with the Leica application suite X software ( Leica ) and YFP / CFP ratio analysis was performed in ImageJ ( NIH ) . Traction Force Microscopy Cell contractile work was measured with ﬁ duciary beads as described previously [ 50 ] . Images of ﬁ duciary particles in the top PDMS layer were acquired with a TCS SP8 confocal microscope ( Leica ) equipped with a 10X / 0 . 4NA objective ( Leica ) . Once the individual regions of interest with cells had been recorded , a 2 % TritonX - 100 , 50 mM sodium azide , 500 mM potassium hydroxide solution was added prior to acquisition of the force - free reference images of the ﬁ duciary particles . Cell strain energy were calculated with the available pyTFM script ( https : / / github . com / fabrylab / pyTFM ) based on traction force and force - free images of the ﬁ duciary particles [ 35 ] . Pattern - Based Quanti ﬁ cation of Cell Contractile Work Cells ’ contractile work was measured with a pattern - based method as described previously [ 49 ] .
