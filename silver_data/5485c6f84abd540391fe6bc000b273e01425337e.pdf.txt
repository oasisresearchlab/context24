Different types of biomaterials are applied for recon - structive indications and receive rising interest . However , autologous bone grafts are still considered as the gold standard for reconstruction of extended bone defects . The generation of bioartificial bone tissues may help to overcome the prob - lems related to donor site morbidity and size limitations . Tissue engineering is , according to its historic definition , an " interdisciplinary field that applies the principles of engineering and the life sciences toward the development of biolog - ical substitutes that restore , maintain , or improve tissue function " . It is based on the understanding of tissue formation and regeneration and aims to rather grow new functional tissues than to build new spare parts . While reconstruction of small to moderate sized bone defects using engineered bone tissues is technically feasible , and some of the currently developed concepts may represent alternatives to autologous bone grafts for certain clinical conditions , the reconstruction of large - volume defects remains challenging . Therefore vascularization concepts gain on interest and the combination of tissue engineering approaches with flap prefabrication techniques may eventually allow application of bone - tissue substitutes grown in vivo with the advantage of minimal donor site morbidity as compared to conventional vascularized bone grafts . The scope of this review is the introduction of basic principles and different components of engineered bioartificial bone tissues with a strong focus on clinical applications in reconstructive surgery . Concepts for the induction of axial vascu - larization in engineered bone tissues as well as potential clinical applications are discussed in detail .

It provides mechanical stability to the skeleton that is needed for load bearing , locomotion and protection of internal organs . Furthermore bone serves as a mineral reservoir and has the capacity to rapidly mobilize mineral stores if needed for home - ostasis of the calcium blood level . The diversity of functional requirements of bone tissue is reflected by its complex architecture . In the adult skeleton bone tissue is either arranged in a trabecular pattern ( can - cellous bone ) or in a compact pattern ( cortical bone ) [ 3 ] . Cortical bone is almost solid with less than 10 % porosity and ubiquitously present in long , short and flat bones . In contrast , cancellous bone is organized in a porous sponge - like pattern . This type of bone har - bors a large part of the bone marrow and is essential - ly present in the metaphysis of long bones , the iliac crest and the vertebral bodies [ 3 ] . Components of bone tissue Although bone tissue is populated by a variety of dif - ferent cells , its functional integrity is maintained by three different cell types : osteoblasts , osteocytes and osteoclasts [ 2 , 4 , 5 ] . These tissue - specific cells are embedded in a highly complex matrix that consists of a mineralized ( hydroxylapatite ) and a non - mineral - ized component [ 6 , 7 ] . The non - mineralized , organic part contains collagens , glycoproteins , proteoglycans and sialoproteins that play an essential role in control of growth and differentiation of osteoblasts , osteo - cytes and osteoclasts and in bone remodeling [ 7 – 10 ] . Bone development and bone regeneration are com - plexly regulated processes that involve a plethora of different growth and transcription factors which coor - dinate the interaction of cells and matrix in response to external or internal stimuli [ 9 , 11 – 20 ] . Bone regeneration Bone regeneration is a highly efficient and tightly regulated process that involves all the above - men - tioned components of bone tissue . Bone regenera - tion is the result of a continuous interplay between growth factors and cytokines for both initiation and regulation of the remodeling process . [ 7 , 17 , 21 ] . The majority of fractures heal well under standard conservative or surgical therapy . However , extend - ed bone defects following trauma or cancer resec - tion or non - unions of fractures may require more sophisticated treatment . In these cases bone graft - ing procedures , segmental bone transport , distrac - tion osteogenesis or biomaterials are applied for reconstruction [ 22 – 25 ] . Established treatment of bone defects Bone grafts Today , autologous bone grafting is the gold stan - dard for osteogenic bone replacement in osseous defects [ 26 ] . Autologous bone grafts reliably fill substance deficits and induce bone tissue formation at the defect site following transplantation . These grafts exhibit , depending on donor site , size , shape and quality , some initial stability . Chips , larger pieces and even blocks of several centimeters in size could be harvested . The use of other types of bone substitutes in combination with autologous bone grafts decreases the amount of bone tissue needed for reconstruction [ 27 ] . However , the clini - cal use of autologous osseous transplants is limited by a considerable donor site morbidity that increas - es with the amount of harvested bone . Bleeding , hematoma , infection , and chronic pain are common complications of bone graft harvest [ 28 – 30 ] . Processed allogenic or xenogenic bone grafts are also commonly used for repair of osseous defects when autologous transplantation is not applicable [ 26 , 31 – 33 ] . Although the initial properties of allo - genic or xenogenic grafts resemble those of autolo - gous bone in terms of biomechanic stability and elasticity , the lack of osteogenicity represents a lim - itation even when osteoinductive factors are pre - served during processing . For specific indications vascularized bone grafts from different locations such as fibula , scapula , iliac crest and others are taken and transplanted into given bone defects using microsurgical techniques [ 34 - 36 ] . Large tissue defects with exposed struc - tures like , bones , joints , tendons and nerves in regions of compromised perfusion do require a tis - sue transplant which brings good vascularity into 8 the affected zone and positively affects healing in the broader sense of the nutrient flap . However , free bone tissue transfer is associated with donor site morbidity [ 37 ] . Furthermore , availability is limited in quality and quantity . Biomaterials A variety of different biomaterials is currently being used for reconstruction of bone defects . Acrylate - based bone cements provide , after poly - merization a high mechanical stability [ 38 , 39 ] . They are widely used for fixation of total joint prosthesis , vertebroplasty and for craniofacial bone defects ; they may be loaded with antibiotics for local drug delivery . However , despite sophisti - cated modes of application they do not possess osteogenic or osteoinductive properties and are , when at all , slowly resorbed . The long - term inte - gration of non - porous bone cements into bone defects is not always warranted . Within the last two decades , many other biogenic and synthetic materials were evaluated for their use as bone sub - stitutes . Calcium phosphate - and apatite - based bone cements , porous composites as well as other types of biomaterials have been clinically applied for treatment of fractures and bone defects [ 40 – 42 ] . They are , depending on their chemical composition and porosity osteoconductive , biodegradable and are integrated into given bone defects . However , in general terms their biome - chanic stability is significantly lower in compari - son to acrylate - based implants . Osteoinductive substances Although osteoinductive substances are clinically applied for reconstruction of bone defects or for acceleration of fracture healing , only small num - bers of patients have been treated and application modes and indications are not completely stan - dardized yet . Platelet rich plasma contains , besides platelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , depending on processing and application modes , a variety of different growth factors [ 43 – 45 ] . It enhanced bone formation in experimental and clinical settings . Demineralized bone matrix ( DBM ) is prepared from allogenic or xenogenic bone and commercial - ly available for clinical application in different for - mulations [ 46 – 49 ] . Its osteoinductive potential is highly variable and depends not only on the donor but also on the processing protocols . DBM is com - monly used in combination with other types of bio - materials [ 50 ] . Bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) have been identified as the most relevant osteoinductive factor in demineralized bone matrix [ 17 , 51 ] . Right now there are two types of BMPs being clinically applied [ 52 ] [ 53 – 55 ] . Application of BMP 2 in open tibial fractures significantly improved bone healing in comparison to a conven - tionally treated control group in a randomized study [ 55 ] . However , heterotopic ossification , sub - optimal release kinetics , and last but not least the high price pose a challenge to widespread applica - tion of these substances . Tissue engineering Definition Tissue Engineering is a young field of research . Initially , it was defined as “… an interdisciplinary field that applies the principles of engineering and the life sciences toward the development of biolog - ical substitutes that restore , maintain , or improve tissue function” [ 56 ] . Tissue Engineering is based on the profound understanding of embryology , tis - sue formation and regeneration and aims to grow - ing new functional tissues rather than building new spare parts . As mentioned above , it combines inte - gral knowledge from physicists , chemists , engi - neers , material scientists , biologists and physicians to a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach . Tissue Engineering is tightly associated with the field of regenerative medicine . Basic principles How to grow new tissues ? Independent of the type of tissue , cells , extracellular matrix , blood vessels , nerves , intercellular communication and cell - matrix interaction are only some “ingredients” to grow new tissues in vivo . These single components have to be combined in a well coordinated spatial and time dependent fashion . Besides the above - mentioned “ingredients” , well elaborated surgical concepts are a prerequisite for successful in vivo application of tissue engineering concepts . Caution is needed with increas - 9 J . Cell . Mol . Med . Vol 10 , No 1 , 2006 ing complexity of the engineered tissue composites , to prevent damage of the susceptible cells or bioactive substances during implantation . Depending on the specific concept , a facultative in vitro period prior to implantation may vary from 1 day up to several months . This period is commonly used for cell expan - sion or induction of tissue - specific cell differentiation . In the experimental setting Tissue Engineering con - cepts have been successfully applied to generate many different types of tissues such as bone , cartilage , liver , muscle , skin and others [ 57 – 62 ] . Properties of bioartificial bone tissues The intended clinical use defines the desired proper - ties of engineered bone substitutes . Defects of load - bearing long bones , for instance , require constructs with high mechanic stability whereas initial plastic - ity is not essential . On the other hand for craniofa - cial applications , initially injectable or moldable constructs are favorable . Although stable integration of the implants is imperative , the mechanic loads involved are not as high as in the former situation . Depending on the implantation site , initial vascular - ization may be essential for enhanced engraftment and prevention of infections . Mechanical stability , osteoconductivity ( i . e . the capacity of a material to guide bone forming tissue into a defect [ 63 ] ) , osteoinductivity ( i . e . the ability to induce bone for - mation by attracting and stimulating bone - forming cells of the recipient [ 64 ] ) , osteogenicity ( i . e . the capability to form bone tissue de novo [ 65 ] ) , and ease of handling have to be well balanced in order to properly meet the clinician’s needs . Components of bioartificial bone Tissues scaffolds Any vital tissue consists of matrix and cells . The matrix acts as a biological three - dimensional scaf - fold for cells within tissues and provides cells with the tissue - specific environment and architecture [ 8 ] . Physiologically it serves as a reservoir for water , nutrients , cytokines and growth factors and allows cells to attach to it . For tissue engineering purposes , three main components could be extract - ed from this complex network of different intercon - nected functions : Mechanic support , cell attach - ment and participation in cellular communication pathways . A vast variety of materials has been used as matrix for bone tissue engineering applications [ 66 , 67 ] . Porosity , surface chemistry , topography , three - dimensional architecture , immunogenicity and mechanic parameters are matrix properties which significantly influence formation of bone within bioartificial bone substitutes [ 68 ] . Gel - like matrices such as fibrin have been used for cell immobilization in combination with other scaffold s [ 69 ] . While a variety of highly innovative matrices are under in vitro and in vivo evaluation , clinically established and approved biomaterials are readily available for first applications of bioartificial bone tissues [ 70 – 77 ] . Computer assisted design – com - puter assisted manufacturing ( CAD / CAM ) and rapid prototyping techniques allow the generation of custom - made scaffolds for cell delivery that fit into certain bone defects [ 77 , 78 ] . Osteogenic cells Osteogenic cells are an integral part of any tissue engineering strategy . These cells are either trans - planted along with the appropriate scaffolds into the bone defect or attracted from the host by osteoin - ductive factors . Osteogenic cells are not a homoge - nous cell population . A differentiation pathway sim - ilar to that of hematopoetic cells has been postulat - ed [ 79 , 80 ] . The affectors of bone remodeling , regeneration and fracture repair in the adult organ - ism are the cellular components . Today it is still unknown which type of osteogenic cell will be the one most suitable for engineering of bone tissue . Mesenchymal stem cells , Bone marrow stromal cells , periosteal cells and osteoblasts have been suc - cessfully used for the generation of bone tissue [ 4 , 75 , 76 , 81 – 83 ] . Isolation and expansion efficiency , stability of osteoblastic phenotype , in vivo bone for - mation capacity , and long - term safety are essential requirements that have to be met by any type of osteogenic cell for successful clinical application . Serum - free culture conditions or culture medium supplemented with autologous serum are preferable for cell expansion in vitro . Recently , clinical applications of tissue engi - neered bone have been reported . Quarto et al . treated three patients with large bone defects of the tibia , ulna , and humerus , using macro porous hydroxyap - 10 atite scaffolds seeded with autologous in vitro expanded bone marrow stromal cells immobilized in collagen gel . All patients recovered limb function without major complications . Vacanti and coworkers reconstructed a patient’s thumb using periosteal cells and a coral - based hydroxyl apatite scaffold [ 84 ] . Although the patient did well after implantation and hand function recovered significantly , quantitative histomorphometric analysis of a biopsy revealed that eventually only 5 % of the implant volume was bone . The outcome of this clinical trial was not superior to that of conventional reconstructive approaches [ 85 ] . Periosteal cell - seeded polymer fleeces or mesenchy - mal stem cells and platelet - rich plasma , immobilized in beta - tricalcium phosphate scaffolds induced bone formation in sinus lift operations [ 86 – 88 ] . Despite anecdotal reports of successful implantation of engi - neered bone tissues , the small number of patients makes it difficult to eventually assess the efficacy of these constructs and comparison with conventional methods has not been performed yet . Osteoinductive factors and gene transfer Osteogenic substances augment the osteogenic capacity of tissue engineered bone constructs . They are either applied as a crude and hardly standardized mixture of proteins as described above ( demineral - ized bone matrix and platelet rich plasma ) or as iso - lated factors [ 21 , 44 , 47 ] . Osteoinductive growth fac - tors have the capability to modulate proliferation and differentiation of implanted osteogenic cells . Furthermore these substances are able to attract pre - cursor cells from the host to invade scaffold and induce osteoblastic differentiation . There is a large number of such proteins that stimulate proliferation and / or differentiation of osteogenic cells in vitro and in vivo . Some osteogenic factors have been cloned and are commercially available as recombinant pro - teins . Bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) are upon the most potent osteoinductive factors . BMPs belong to the TGF - β family and bind to extracellular matrix components such as heparan sulfate and type IV col - lagen [ 89 , 90 ] . BMP2 and BMP - 7 are being clinical - ly applied for fractures and non - unions , but only a limited number of patients have been treated so far with long term follow up still pending [ 54 , 55 ] . The effective in vivo use of isolated osteoinductive growth factors requires optimized pharmacokinetics . Intelligent delivery systems have proven to be of cru - cial importance for reliable bone formation and eco - nomic application of BMPs [ 91 ] . Without controlled release systems , growth factors rapidly diffuse away from the constructs . Gene therapeutic approaches potentially promote pertinent function of osteogenic cells and enhance performance of bioartificial bone tissues [ 92 - 95 ] . Expression systems for osteoinductive growth fac - tors are therefore of high interest . There are different strategies to bring DNA sequences into cells . Viral vectors provide high transfection efficiency and some viruses even allow stable transfection of osteogenic cells [ 96 ] . Clinical use in tissue engineer - ing concepts is however hampered by safety con - cerns . Non - viral gene transfer is achieved by either using transfection reagents , or by mediator - free tech - niques [ 97 ] . Matrix - mediated gene transfer is anoth - er innovative approach that avoids the use of any transfection reagent or potentially harmful vector [ 98 ] . In conclusion , gene transfer strategies may pro - vide for efficient stimulation of bone formation with - in bioartificial bone tissues , but further insight into long - term effects , phenotypical stability and applica - tion techniques need to precede any wide - spread application in humans . Vascularization of engineered bone tissues Adequate vascularization is a prerequisite for for - mation of high quality bone . When in vitro engi - neered cellular constructs are transferred in vivo they have to rely on processes like interstitial fluid diffusion and blood perfusion . Here recites a core limitation for transfer of tissue engineering models from the in vitro to the in vivo environ - ment . Diffusion is the initial process involved , but it can only provide for cell support within a max - imum range of 200 µm into the matrix [ 99 , 100 ] . The survival of cells in the center of large cell - containing constructs is therefore often limited by suboptimal initial vascularization [ 57 ] . Cell label - ing experiments disclosed a considerable loss of osteoblasts within the first week following trans - plantation in porous cancellous bone matrices [ 101 ] . For this reason induction of vascularization is an integral element of any successful bone tis - sue engineering concept . 11 J . Cell . Mol . Med . Vol 10 , No 1 , 2006 Angioinductive growth factors Angiogenesis is a complexly regulated process [ 102 – 104 ] . Several mechanisms of regulation are involved throughout the angiogenetic cascade of events ; the endothelial cell acting as the main mediator of neo - vascular growth is guided through space and time . A large number of angiogenic factors work together in a highly coordinated manner to induce endothelial cell outgrowth and the formation of functional vessels . These factors are promising tools for induction and accelera - tion of vascularization processes in three - dimensional scaffolds [ 105 , 106 ] . VEGF and bFGF have been suc - cessfully used to improve vascularization of engineered tissues [ 107 ] . Immobilization of angiogenetic growth factors , for instance in fibrin gels or by using heparine - binding release systems , allows for optimized release kinetics and longer lasting effects [ 108 , 109 ] . Endothelial cells Endothelial cells , either derived from microvascula - ture , umbilical veins or large blood vessels , have been used for generation of capillary - like structures and vessles in vitro by different groups [ 110 – 112 ] . In vivo these cells are supposed to form networks of capillar - ies and gain access to the recipient’s circulation [ 113 ] . Although the newly formed vascular networks dis - play , depending on the experimental setting , a differ - entiated morphology , the processes that occur upon implantation are not completely understood at the moment and there are only scarce in vivo data on the efficiency of this approach with regard to enhance and accelerate vascularization of bioartificial tissues . Since cell - containing constructs require immediate supply with nutrients and oxygen after implantation and even with synchronous transplantation of endothelial cells some time is needed for formation of anastomoses between newly formed capillaries and the recipient’s circulation , the potential benefits of endothelial cell transplantation for induction of vas - cularization are questionable [ 114 ] . Local factors at the recipient site Local factors play a prominent role in tissue engi - neering concepts since the quality of the tissue at the recipient site influences vascularization of the scaf - folds , cell engraftment and eventually bone forma - tion . Neovascularization from the surrounding tis - sues , which is responsible for long - term survival of transplanted osteogenic cells , is a slow process so that constructs pre - seeded with tissue specific cells need to be sufficiently thin to ensure rapid vascular - ization and cell survival [ 115 ] . Even a perfectly engi - neered piece of tissue will fail to form bone when the local environment is inappropriate . In a clinical set - ting , for instance in cases of large bone defects fol - lowing trauma or osteomyelitis , bacterial load and chronic scarring pose even more challenge to the transplanted constructs . Plastic surgical concepts may help to bridge the gap between perfectly in vitro engineered bone tissues and the sometimes disap - pointing in vivo performance . Surgical angiogenesis The majority of the above - mentioned tissue engineer - ing approaches rely on the so called “extrinsic” mode of neovascularization [ 116 ] . The neovascular bed originates from the periphery of the construct which should be implanted into a site of high vascularization potential . Subcutaneous [ 69 ] , intramuscular [ 117 ] , and intraperitoneal [ 57 ] implantation has been report - ed . Although generation of vascularized bone tissue is feasible using this technique , this tissue is vascular - ized in a random pattern . Transfer to distant implan - tation sites is impossible without destruction of the vascular network . Reconstructive surgeons aim there - fore to generate so called “axially vascularized” tis - sues that could be transferred to the defect site using microsurgical techniques of vascular anastomosis . These tissues are immediately vascularized upon implantation into the defect as free flaps do . In the following section different techniques for the induc - tion of axial vascularization in bone grafts are dis - cussed in detail . Flap prefabrication and bone grafts Conventional osteomyocutaneous flaps do not always meet the requirements of a composite defect . A prefabricated composite flap can be cre - ated according to the complex geometry of the defect . Prefabrication of multi component flaps is a well established procedure in plastic surgery [ 118 – 120 ] . This concept is based on the revascu - larization phenomenon directly related to host tis - 12 sue vascularity [ 121 ] and significantly expanded the frontiers of reconstructive surgery . Tissue pre - fabrication is essentially a method comprised by two steps . During the first procedure a tissue com - ponent is formed into the wanted shape and is thereupon implanted into a region with a vascular axis suitable for microsurgical transfer . During the second stage the autologous implant is harvested en - bloc with the surrounding tissue and the vascu - lar pedicle as a free flap . The implant acquires its vascularization from the tissue block and the flap is connected to the local circulation by means of a microvascular anastomosis . Prefabrication allows the transfer of preferred tis - sue composites suitable for reconstruction regard - less of their native vascular origin as free or pedicled flaps and helps to reduce donor site morbidity [ 122 ] . Prefabrication of bone flaps using plastic surgical techniques may help to circumvent preceding prob - lems of microsurgical bone transfer and to obtain previously non - existing tissue units that meet exact - ly the specific recipient site needs . Basically there are two strategies for flap prefabrication : either a bone graft is wrapped in axially vascularized tissues ( cutaneous , fascioucutaneous or muscle flaps ) or a vascular axis is implanted into the bone graft . The latter type of vascularization is called “intrinsic” . In the “intrinsic” mode of vascularization the construct acquires an inherent perfusion and does not have to rely on favourable local conditions . This is achieved by inducing angiogenesis from a centrally located vascular axis . The configuration of the vascular axis could vary according to the reconstructive require - ments [ 123 ] . After a facultative vascularization peri - od the vascularized graft is transferred into the bone defect using conventional or microsurgical tech - niques . Prefabricated bone grafts have been clinical - ly applied in different settings [ 124 , 125 ] . Generation of vascularized bioartificial bone tissue Flap prefabrication using conventional bone grafts allows generation of new types of flaps indepen - dent of the vascular anatomy of the bone trans - plant . However , the donor site morbidity after har - vesting of the bone grafts is still a problem . Recently , biomaterials , osteogenic cells and osteoinductive growth factors have been used for generation of vascularized bone tissues in combi - nation with a vascular axis or vascularized flaps . Revascularization of scaffolds is induced by an inflammatory wound healing response as a reaction to the surgical implantation . This , combined with the hypoxia within the implant evokes local expression of angiogenetic growth factors . Bone formation beneath “standard flaps” has been suc - cessfully induced using bioceramics seeded with autologous bone marrow stromal cells [ 126 ] . Induction of axial vascularization protected porous biomaterials from bacterial infection and transfer of this vascularized hard tissue as a free flap has been demonstrated [ 127 ] . Pedicled bone flaps based on collagen I scaffolds , bone marrow stro - mal cells and a PTFE membrane have been suc - cessfully generated using the carotid artery and jugular vein or the saphenous bundle as vascular axis [ 128 ] . Prefabricated vascularized bone grafts have even be used in a clinical setting for mandibu - lar reconstruction following thorough in vivo eval - uation in a pig model . This group buried granules of xenogenic bone minerals soaked with recombi - nant OP - 1 in the latissimus dorsi muscle and trans - ferred the neo - tissue using microsurgical tech - niques into mandibular defects [ 129 , 130 ] . In the clinical setting a titanium cage was custom made according to CT scan and 3D reconstruction data , filled with bone marrow aspirate , xenogenic bone minerals and OP - 1 , and a large mandibular defect was successfully reconstructed following a prefab - rication period of 7 weeks [ 131 ] . “Free - Style” vascularized bioartificial bone grafts In the last decade the field of surgically induced angio - genesis has tremendously developed . Induction of “intrinsic” vascularization in biomaterials allowed the generation of vascularized tissues at different sites for transfer as pedicled or free flaps in several animal models . Although a number of vascular axes are avail - able for intrinsically vascularized tissue compounds in humans , there remain limitations with regard to pedi - cle length and anatomic location . The creation of a vascular axis using vein grafts holds promise for gen - eration of vascularized bone units relatively indepen - dent of anatomical limitations . Erol and Spira man - aged to produce a prefabricated skin flap by means of an arteriovenous vessel - loop using either artery or vein grafts in a rat model [ 132 ] . They observed an 13 J . Cell . Mol . Med . Vol 10 , No 1 , 2006 abundant neovascular outgrowth originating from the entire AV Loop . Morrison and co - workers augmented this model and implanted the AV - loop into polycar - bonate isolation chambers . Furthermore they induced vascularization in polymer matrices and managed to generate large volumes of axially vascularized tissue [ 133 – 135 ] . In the era of tissue engineering this con - cept met with great interest . Recently , our group vas - cularized successfully a custom - made processed bovine cancellous bone matrix by means of an arteri - ovenous loop [ 136 ] . Meticulous analysis of the angio - genetic response by morphometry , high resolution 14 Fig . 1 Vascularization of porous matrices by implanting an arteriovenous loop . A . The arteriovenous loop consist - ing of an isolated artery and vein , and a vein graft of variable length is constructed using microsurgical techniques . In the rat model the loop is constructed between the femoral artery and vein . B . The significant degree of vascular - ity in the axially vascularized bioartificial tissue is demonstrated by intravital MRI angiography . High flow rates are highlighted by yellow staining . C & D . Differentiated morphology of the vascular system originating from the arte - riovenous loop is demonstrated by sanning electron microscopy of vascular corrosion replicas . Vessels of different calibers invade the porous matrix and form a vascular bed for subsequent injection of osteogenic cells . micro MRI and vascular corrosion casts revealed a vascularization of more than 90 % of the scaffold with - in 8 weeks following implantation [ Fig . 1 ] . The amount of vascularization was comparable with extrinsically vascularized control matrices ; however , the inflammatory reaction was considerably less pro - nounced in the AV loop group [ 137 ] . Furthermore , prevascularization of porous hard tissue scaffolds by means of an arteriovenous loop significantly increased the number of initially engrafted osteoblasts in prelim - inary experiments [ 138 ] . Bone formation following osteoblast injection is right now being evaluated over a longer observation period in the same model . Conclusion Tissue engineering is a fascinating field of research and is bound to dramatically change clinical practice in reconstructive surgery . Osteogenic cells for bioactive implants are readily available following minimally invasive harvesting and ex vivo expansion . A plethora of highly innovative biomaterials with well tuned matrix properties have been developed to perfectly meet the clinician’s requirements . Osteoinductive sub - stances may further enhance bone formation within engineered composites . Optimized implantation tech - niques are one more essential step towards clinical application of engineered bioartificial bone tissues . The answers towards upscaling of bioartificial devices will be delivered by advances in the area of vascularization . In the future , joint approaches are needed in order to transfer highly potent bioartificial osteogenic bone tis - sues into the demanding in vivo environment [ Fig . 2 ] . Close cooperation between tissue engineers and recon - structive surgeons may eventually help to bridge the gap between bench and bedside . Acknowlegments The authors would like to thank Dr . A .
