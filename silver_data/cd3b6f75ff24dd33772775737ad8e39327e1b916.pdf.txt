Running title : PM PI4P turnover by a mitochondrial SAC1 Abstract Oxysterol binding protein ( OSBP ) - related proteins ( ORPs ) 5 and 8 have been shown to deplete the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PI4P ) at sites of membrane contact between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and plasma membrane ( PM ) . This is believed to be caused by transport of PI4P from the PM to the ER , where PI4P is degraded by an ER - localized SAC1 phosphatase . This is proposed to power the anti - port of phosphatidylserine ( PS ) lipids from ER to PM , up their concentration gradient . Alternatively , ORPs have been proposed to sequester PI4P , dependent on the concentration of their alternative lipid ligand . Here , we aimed to distinguish these possibilities in living cells by orthogonal targeting of PI4P transfer and degradation to PM - mitochondria contact sites . Surprisingly , we found that orthogonal targeting of SAC1 to mitochondria enhanced PM PI4P turnover independent of targeting to contact sites with the PM . This turnover could be slowed by knock - down of soluble ORP2 , which also has a major impact on PM PI4P levels even without SAC1 over - expression . The data reveal a role for contact site - independent modulation of PM PI4P levels and lipid antiport . 2 Introduction The exchange of lipids by non - vesicular lipid transport is a core function of membrane contact sites between organelles ( Prinz et al . , 2020 ) . This process can be mediated by soluble or tethered lipid transfer proteins that bind and solubilize individual lipids , or else proteinaceous conduits that permit lipids to flow between membranes ( Wong et al . , 2019 ) . However , these proteins present a thermodynamic conundrum : Lipid exchange is known to enrich specific lipids in one membrane relative to the other at the contact site , yet the proteins themselves employ what is essentially a passive transport process . In other words , how can a lipid transfer protein move a lipid up a concentration gradient ? A seminal discovery shed light on one answer to this question ( Saint - Jean et al . , 2011 ) : the discovery that Osh4p , a yeast member of the ORP family , can bind to both sterols and a phosphoinositide , PI4P . It followed that ORPs could employ an anti - porter mechanism ; specifically , a phosphoinositide concentration gradient is created between the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) and the ER by TGN localized PI 4 - kinases ( PI4Ks ) that generate PI4P , and the ER - localized SAC1 phosphatase that degrades it . Transport of PI4P down this gradient by Osh4p releases energy used to counter - transport sterol from the ER back to the TGN , up its gradient . Ultimately , the energy of ATP hydrolysis is coupled to sterol transport via PI4P turnover . The mechanism was subsequently demonstrated for cholesterol transport at the mammalian TGN by OSBP ( Mesmin et al . , 2013 ) , and was expanded to include PS transport from ER to PM by ORP5 and ORP8 in humans ( Chung et al . , 2015 ) and the homologues Osh6p and Osh7p in yeast ( Filseck et al . , 2015 ) . An implicit assumption of this model is that SAC1 activity acts to deplete PI4P and maintain the gradient , acting downstream of PI4P transport . It follows that ablation of SAC1 activity would lead to the accumulation of PI4P in the ER , which has been observed ( Cheong et al . , 2010 ; Zewe et al . , 2018 ) . However , PI4P transport by ORP family proteins remains controversial . An alternative hypothesis posits that ORP proteins act as negative regulators of PI4P signaling by sequestering the lipid , and that this inhibition can be relieved by high local concentrations of the counter lipid such as sterol ( Wang et al . , 2019b ) . Thus , the alternative lipid cargoes modulate available PI4P pools . Differentiation of these mechanisms can be difficult in cells , where both hypotheses predict decreases in accessible PI4P levels by ORPs in donor membranes like the PM or TGN . In this paper , we attempted to answer the question : To what extent does PM PI4P catabolism depend on lipid transport to the ER via membrane contact sites ? Our approach was to reconstitute the PI4P transfer and hydrolysis steps at orthogonal , PM : mitochondria contact sites . Surprisingly , we find that simply re - targeting SAC1 to the mitochondrial outer membrane , independent of membrane contact sites , is sufficient to accelerate PM PI4P turnover . The data implicate the non - contact site targeting ORP2 as a major mediator of PM PI4P turnover . Results To test mechanisms of PM PI4P catabolism in cells , we began with experiments to engineer the most potent PM PI4P lipid transfer protein identified to date , ORP5 ( Chung et al . , 2015 ; Sohn et al . , 2018 ) . ORP5 contains an N - terminal extended Pleckstrin Homology ( PH ) domain that interacts selectively with the PM via PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ( Sohn et al . , 2018 ) ; this is connected to the ORD lipid - transfer domain by a long region of low complexity , and is anchored to the ER by a C - terminal transmembrane helix ( cartoon in Fig . 1A ) . When expressed as an mCherry - fusion , ORP5 localizes to ER - PM contact sites , co - localizing with the ER - PM contact site marker MAPPER ( Chang et al . , 2013 ) when viewed by equatorial or ventral confocal sections ( Fig . 1A ) . Previously , acute depletion of PM PI4P was demonstrated by replacing the N - terminal PH domain with the FK506 binding protein ( FKBP ) domain and inducing FKBP dimerization with a PM anchored FK506 and Rapamycin Binding domain of mTor ( FRB ) via the addition of rapamycin . This acute restoration of ORP5 ER - PM contact site localization was presumed to induce transport of PM PI4P to the ER , where it was degraded by SAC1 ( Chung et al . , 2015 ) . To facilitate orthogonal contact site formation 3 between the PM and another organelle ( thereby uncoupling ORP5 transport from degradation by ER SAC1 ) , we instead replaced the C - terminal ER - localizing helix with FKBP , a fusion henceforth termed ORP5 ∆ TMD - FKBP ( cartoon in Fig 1B ) . This generates a PM localization no longer restricted to MAPPER - labelled ER - PM contact sites ( Fig . 1B ) . We then acutely restored ORP5 ∆ TMD - FKBP localization to ER - PM contact sites by rapamycin - induced dimerization with an ER - anchored FRB domain ( Fig 1C ) . Such sites formed rapidly ( completing within ~ 5 min ) when viewed by ventral confocal section . In parallel , we tracked the distribution of PI4P using the high affinity lipid biosensor EGFP - P4Mx2 ( Hammond et al . , 2014 ) . As expected , we did not see accumulation of PI4P at these contact sites ( see graph in Fig . 1C ) , presumably due to SAC1 activity in the ER . Rather , the fluorescence of PM PI4P seemed to decline , though this is not as obvious when viewed by confocal in such ventral focal planes . We next sought to test whether orthogonal targeting of ORP5 ∆ TMD - FKBP to PM - mitochondrial contact sites would cause accumulation of PI4P in the latter organelle . Figure 1 : An engineered ORP5 ectopically targeted to PM - mitochondria contact sites fails to transfer PI4P . ( A ) mCherry - ORP5 localizes to ER - PM contact sites marked by the ER - PM contact site marker , MAPPER . Images show equatorial and ventral confocal sections of the same , representative cells . ( B ) Replacement of the ER - resident transmembrane domain ( TMD ) of ORP5 with FKBP leads to a de - localized PM localization , overlapping with but not restricted to MAPPER - labelled ER - PM contact sites . ( C ) mCherry - ORP5 ∆ TMD - FKBP can be returned to ER - PM contact sites by rapamycin - induced dimerization with an ER - localized FRB domain ( iRFP - FRB - CYB5 tai ) , though no enrichment of PI4P is seen at these induced contact sites . ( D ) mCherry - ORP5 ∆ TMD - FKBP can be targeted to ectopic mitochondrial - PM contact sites by rapamycin - induced dimerization with an mitochondria - localized FRB domain ( AKAP1 N31 - FRB - iRFP ) , though no enrichment of PI4P is seen at these induced contact sites . For C & D , images show ventral confocal sections of representative cells ; the graphs show the normalized mCherry - ORP5 ∆ TMD - FKBP or P4Mx2 PI4P biosensor enrichment at ER or mitochondrial contact sites , respectively . Data are grand means ± s . e . of three experiments , with 10 cells per experiment . 4 Rapamycin induced dimerization recruited ORP5 ∆ TMD - FKBP to bright patches marked by mitochondria outer membrane - localized FRB , albeit somewhat more slowly than it recruits to ER - localized FRB ( Fig . 1D ) . However , we saw no evidence of PI4P accumulation at these PM - mitochondria contacts ( Fig . 1D ) . Several scenarios could be envisioned that may preclude productive transfer of PM PI4P to mitochondria by ORP5 ∆ TMD - FKBP . One possibility is suggested by recent studies of the homologous yeast protein , Osh6p ( Eisenreichova et al . , 2021 ) . That study reported that binding of PI4P by Osh6p is so tight that lipid transfer is inhibited . Hydrolysis of PI4P was required to deplete the lipid and permit PS binding in these experiments . We therefore hypothesized that SAC1 activity may in fact be required for productive release of the PI4P . To test this , we engineered SAC1 to ectopically target mitochondria . We replaced the ER - localized transmembrane domains with the mitochondrial outer membrane - targeting C - terminal 31 amino acids from Fis1 ( Stojanovski et al . , 2004 ) , generating SAC1mito . This construct ( fused to Figure 2 : An engineered mitochondria - targeted SAC1 is active in cells . ( A ) SAC1 mito co - localizes with the mitochondrial marker , CAX8A N29 x2 - mCherry ( pink ) . Images show representative equatorial confocal sections of two COS - 7 cells . ( B ) Mitochondrial PI4P synthesis was induced by addition of rapamycin , which induces dimerization of over - expressed mCherry - FKBP - PI4K C1001 with iRFP - FRB - mito ; this initiates ectopic PI4P synthesis on mitochondria outer membranes , detected with EGFP - P4Mx1 biosensor . The accumulation is blocked by co - expression of tagBFP2 - SAC1 mito . Images show equatorial confocal sections of COS - 7 cells before or after addition of rapamycin .

To demonstrate activity of SAC1mito , we capitalized on our recent demonstration that PI4P synthesis can be ectopically induced on the mitochondria outer membrane by recruitment of the C - terminal helical - catalytic domain of PI4KA ( Zewe et al . , 2020 ) . As shown in the left - hand panels of Fig . 2B , PI4P accumulation is readily detected with PI4P biosensor , P4M ( Hammond et al . , 2014 ) . Co - expression of SAC1mito under these conditions completely abolishes PI4P accumulation under these conditions ( right hand panels in Fig . 2B and Fig . 2C ) , despite identical recruitment of the PI4K ( inset in Fig . 2C ) . We did note a small decrease in baseline mitochondria associated P4M fluorescence in Sac1mito - expressing cells ( Fig . 1C ) , though this was not statistically significant ( Fig . 2D ) . The block in PI4P synthesis induced by SAC1mito was complete , showing no significant deviation from 0 when measuring the area under the curve ( Fig . 2E ) . These results show that we could reconstitute ER - like PI4P degradation on the mitochondrial outer membrane . We next tested the ability of SAC1mito to contribute to plasma membrane PI4P turnover . We accomplished this via inhibition of the major PM PI4P synthesizing enzyme , PI4KA , using the potent and selective inhibitor GSK - A1 ( Bojjireddy et al . , 2014 ) . The rate of PI4P degradation or traffic from the PM can then be monitored by the drop in fluorescence of a high affinity PI4P biosensor , the P4C Figure 3 : SAC1 mito accelerates PM PI4P turnover .

We overexpressed both wild - type , ER - localized SAC1 together with SAC1mito , with either one being catalytically active whilst the other was an inactive ( C389S ) mutant ( Fig . 3A ) . As previously reported ( Sohn et al . , 2016 ) , over - expression of active , wild - type SAC1 accelerates PM PI4P depletion from the PM ( Fig . 3B ) , presumably because the amount of SAC1 in the ER is rate - limiting for PM PI4P clearance . To our surprise , SAC1mito also accelerated PM PI4P turnover ( Fig . 3B ) – at least as potently as the ER - localized , wild - type enzyme ( Fig . 3C ) . To compare the relative activities of the enzymes , we transfected in either a low ( 50 ng ) or high plasmid mass ( 500 ng ) of either wild - type SAC1 or SAC1mito , and measured PI4P turnover in the same assay ( Fig . 3D ) . We measured both the relative fluorescence intensity of the EGFP - tagged enzyme in TIRFM as a proxy for enzyme concentration proximal to the PM , and also the rate of PM mCherry - P4Mx2 depletion . As shown in Fig . 3E , transfection of low or high plasmid mass led to the expected relative enzyme concentrations when viewed in TIRFM , with slightly increased concentrations of wild - type SAC1 compared to SAC1mito at each plasmid mass – likely because there is more ER in proximity of the PM . Turning to PI4P turnover , both SAC1s caused a dose - dependent increase in PI4P turnover ( Fig . 3F ) . SAC1mito proved much more effective , however ; transfection of a 50 ng concentration of SAC1mito was much more potent than 50 ng of wild - type SAC1 , and was even as effective as 500 ng wild type ( Fig . 3 F , G ) . We previously reported that SAC1 is unable to directly hydrolyze PM PI4P from the ER in trans ( Zewe et al . , 2018 ) . One potential explanation for enhanced PI4P turnover by SAC1mito could therefore be trans activity of the engineered enzyme , conferred by the altered mitochondrially - targeted tail . Even at the greatly reduced area of PM - mito contact sites , SAC1mito might clear PM PI4P much more efficiently than the ER - localized enzyme , which is reliant on lipid transfer . We explored this possibility with experiments to greatly expand the number of PM - mito contact sites in cells expressing SAC1mito ; we aimed to test if PM PI4P turnover was further accelerated . This was accomplished through rapamycin - induced dimerization of PM localized FKBP and mitochondrially targeted FRB . As a control , we utilized a non - membrane targeted FRB , which exhibited the accelerated PI4P turnover over 15 Figure 4 : SAC1 mito - mediated PM PI4P turnover is not enhanced at mito : PM contact sites . COS - 7 cells were transfected with TagBFP2 - Sac1 mito , EGFP - P4C PI4P biosensor , iRFP713 - FRB - Fis1 C31 ( FRB mito ) and the indicated FKBP - tagged construct , After 18 - 24 h , they were subject to time lapse imaging by TIRFM . At time 0 , 30 nM PI4KA inhibitor GSK - A1 was added together with 1 µM rapamycin to induced dimerization of FRB and FKBP . FKBP - tagged constructs were : ( A ) mCherry - FKBP as control ; ( B ) an artificial PM - localized tethering construct , mCherry - FKBP - ELL - CAAX , consisting of the PM - anchored c - terminal tail of H - Ras linked to FKBP by an artificial helical and flexible linker mCherry - ORP5 ∆ TMD - FKBP ; ( C ) a double deletion mutant of ORP5 lacking ER - localized transmembrane domain and the ORD , mCherry - ORP5 ∆ ORD - ∆ TMD - FKBP ; ( D ) the PI4P - binding deficient mutant , mCherry - ORP5 H378 / 9A - ∆ TMD - FKBP ; and ( E ) mCherry - ORP5 ∆ TMD - FKBP . For all panels , graphs show the ratio of mCherry - FKBP fluorescence at mitochondria to elsewhere in the TIRF footprint ( i . e . PM ) , the relative intensity of the iRFP - FRB mito signal and the total fluorescence intensity of EGFP - P4C in the TIRF footprint over time . Data are grand means ± s . e . of 3 experiments , analyzing 10 - 12 cells per experiment . 7 min ( Fig . 4A ) . Recruitment of FRB - mito to FKBP tethered to the PM by extended flexible and helical linkers linked to the palmitoylated and myristoylated N - terminus of Lyn kinase greatly expanded PM - mito contact sites , but failed to further accelerate PM PI4P turnover ( Fig . 4B ) . As an alternative approach , we utilized a deletion mutant of ORP5 ∆ TMD missing the lipid transfer ORD ( Fig . 4C ) ; this produced more rapid formation of PM - mito contact sites , but also failed to accelerate PM PI4P clearance . An ORP5TMD - FKBP with a PI4P binding - deficient ORD behaved almost identically ( Fig . 4D ) . Finally , we employed a PI4P - transfer competent ORP5 ∆ TMD - FKBP , but still saw no further acceleration of PM PI4P clearance ( Fig 4E ) . Therefore , lipid transfer or simple membrane proximity did not appear to play a rate - limiting role in accelerating PM PI4P catabolism by SAC1mito . If transfer of PI4P at PM - mito contact sites or trans activity of SAC1mito cannot explain the accelerated PM PI4P turnover , what could ? Currently , PM PI4P turnover is thought to be driven by ORP5 and ORP8 at ER : PM contact Figure 5 : ORP2 over - expression accelerates PM PI4P turnover ( A ) Representative confocal micrographs of COS - 7 cells over - expressing the indicated neonGreen - tagged ORP construct ( or neonGreen alone as control ) together with the mCherry - P4C PI4P and iRFP713 - PH - PLC δ 1 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensors and the inactive TagBFP2 - SAC1 mito - C389S ( not shown ) .

However , we hypothesized that ORP proteins without such strict contact site localization may facilitate lipid transfer more broadly , perhaps presenting PI4P to our ectopically - targeted mitochondrial SAC1 . Specifically , we studied ORPs 2 , 3 and 6 , since these paralogs have been reported to exhibit an at least partially cytosolic Figure 6 : ORP2 is a major contributor to basal and SAC1 mito - mediated PM PI4P turnover .

( I ) Proposed model for ORP2 function in SAC1 mito - mediated PM PI4P depletion ; ORP2 removes PI4P from the PM , either tethered to VAPA or B at ER : PM contact sites ( arrows 1 and 2 ) or untethered anywhere in the PM ( arrow 3 ) . From there , ORP2 diffuses to mitochondria to deliver PI4P for hydrolysis , either still tethered to VAPA or B ( and thus occurring at ER : mitochondria contact sites , arrow 1 ) or untethered from VAPs ( arrow 3 ) . 9 localization ( Lehto et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2019a ) and been implicated in PM phosphoinositide transfer cycles ( Mochizuki et al . , 2018 ; Wang et al . , 2019a ) . When expressed in COS - 7 cells , neonGreen - tagged ORP2 , 3 and 6 all exhibited a primarily cytosolic localization , in contrast to the punctate , PM - apposed localization of ORP5 ( Fig . 5A ) . Co - transfection of high - affinity PI4P ( P4C ) and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ( PH - PLC δ 1 ) biosensors revealed much less prominent PM labelling by P4C in ORP2 and ORP5 transfected cells ( Fig . 5A ) . Quantitative image analysis confirmed reduced PM PI4P in ORP2 and ORP5 - expressing cells ( Fig . 5B ) , as previously shown for ORP5 ( Sohn et al . , 2018 ; Zewe et al . , 2018 ; Chung et al . , 2015 ) . Although both ORP2 and ORP5 have been reported to transfer PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ( Ghai et al . , 2017 ; Wang et al . , 2019a ; Koponen et al . , 2019 ) , we could not detect a change in steady - state levels reported by PH - PLC δ 1 ( Fig . 5C ) . Co - expression of SAC1mito had no additional effect on either PM PI4P or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Figs . 5B , C ) . We next tested effects of over - expressed ORP proteins on PM PI4P turnover by measuring PI4P clearance rates from the PM after inhibition of PI4KA . Consistent with previous reports ( Sohn et al . , 2018 ) , we could see accelerated reduction of PI4P by ORP5 ( Figs . 5D , E ) ; of the other ORP proteins , only ORP2 showed accelerated clearance of PM PI4P , with a similar rate to ORP5 ( Figs . 5D - F ) . ORP3 and 6 , by contrast , had no significant effect ( Figs . 5E , F ) . Therefore , ORP2 appeared to be a viable candidate to facilitate transfer of PI4P from the PM , perhaps presenting it to ectopically expressed SAC1mito . Despite its cytosolic localization when over - expressed ( Fig . 6A ) , ORP2 contains a classical FFAT motif that binds ER - localized VAPA and VAPB proteins ( Loewen et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore , the cytosolic localization of over - expressed ORP2 may be due to saturation of the endogenous VAP proteins , leaving no mechanism for ER targeting of excess neonGreen - ORP2 . Indeed , co - expression of mCherry - VAPB caused ER localization of neonGreen - ORP2 ( Fig . 6B ) . Nevertheless , ER localization of ORP2 was incomplete even with VAPB over - expression , showing significant cytosolic ORP2 “haze” between ER cisternae ( Fig . 6B ) . We also expressed ORP2 at much lower levels for 4 hours , hoping to avoid saturation of endogenous VAP proteins . In this context , we still observed ORP2 being mainly cytosolic ( Fig . 6C ) . Therefore , ORP2 does not appear to be tightly associated with the ER and can likely access any organellar cytosolic membrane leaflet . We then sought to determine whether ORP2 contributes to PM PI4P turnover through small interfering RNA - mediated knock down of ORP2 . This led to a significant slowing of PM PI4P loss ( measured with P4C in TIRFM ) after PI4K inhibition ( Fig . 6D , E ) . Crucially , the knockdown also abolished the accelerated turnover of PI4P induced by SAC1mito ( Fig . 6F , G and H ) . Therefore , it seems highly likely that the accelerated PM PI4P turnover induced by SAC1mito is because endogenous ORP2 transfers PI4P to the mitochondrial outer membrane for hydrolysis , a reaction that cannot happen in normally SAC1 - devoid mitochondria ( Fig . 4I ) . Discussion To what extent does PM PI4P catabolism depend on lipid transport to the ER via membrane contact sites ? We designed the experiments reported here to address this question . Whilst attempting to orthogonally target PM PI4P transport away from the ER to the mitochondrial outer membrane ( Figs . 1 - 2 ) , we made the unexpected discovery that PI4P turnover speeds up simply by targeting the major PI4P phosphatase , SAC1 , to mitochondria ( Fig . 3 ) . No requirements for enhanced PM - mito contact sites were apparent ( Fig . 4 ) . This result was initially perplexing . Indeed , in a previous manuscript ( now withdrawn ) , we erroneously attributed this enhanced turnover to an engineered ORP5 that we similarly targeted to mitochondria ( Doyle et al . , 2022 ) . The experiments reported here show unequivocally that the orthogonally targeted ORP5 is not required ( Fig . 4 ) . Instead , we found that the non - contact site targeted OSBP related protein , ORP2 , contributes to both basal PI4P turnover ( Figs . 5 - 6 ) and the SAC1mito - induced accelerated turnover ( Fig . 6 ) . The data suggest that lipid transport , occurring separately from ER - PM membrane contact sites , could predominate the PI4P catabolic process . It also explains why native SAC1 is found through the ER , rather than enriched at ER : PM contact sites ( Nemoto et al . , 2000 ; Zewe et al . , 2018 ) . 10 It seems initially surprising that over - expression of SAC1 activity accelerates PI4P turnover at all : the fact that PI4P is never observed in the ER suggests that it is the rate of PI4P transport , rather than the rate of SAC1 hydrolysis , that is rate limiting . Yet , the acceleration of PI4P turnover reported here ( Fig . 3 ) and by others ( Sohn et al . , 2018 ) after SAC1 over - expression suggests that SAC1’s catalytic activity is indeed rate limiting . So why isn’t PI4P accumulation observed in the ER ? And if PI4P can be presented to and hydrolyzed by SAC1mito , why isn’t PI4P transfer to the mitochondrial outer membrane not normally observed ? A clue comes from elegant in vitro work on the ORP ( Eisenreichova et al . , 2021 ; Ikhlef et al . , 2021 ) ; here , the ORD domain was shown to have exceptionally high affinity for PI4P , such that it inhibited binding and transport of the counter lipid , PS . These experiments predicted and demonstrated a requirement for PI4P hydrolysis for PS transport to occur . This high affinity suggests that the slow release ( off rate ) and rapid binding ( on rate ) of PI4P to ORD may cause rapid re - binding of released PI4P molecules at tethered membranes ; lipid transfer would be effectively stalled , and the ORD would be saturated with PI4P . Efficient PI4P hydrolysis by SAC1 at the tethered membrane prevents this , facilitating counter lipid transport . Therefore , increasing SAC1 catalytic activity in the ER through over - expression effectively increases the off rate of the ORP and accelerates the whole transport cycle . This mechanism also suggests why SAC1mito is more effective than over - expressing wild - type SAC1 : an ORP protein ( like ORP2 ) not tethered to the PI4P replete membrane could bind any organelle membrane and deliver PI4P , either from ER contact sites ( Fig . 6I , steps 1 & 2 ) or the cytosol ( step 3 ) . From here , the ORP will release but then rapidly rebind the PI4P until such time as it dissociates from the membrane . Only if the membrane has SAC1 activity is the PI4P not rebound ( because it has been hydrolyzed ) . Therefore , we postulate that expression of SAC1mito effectively harnesses the entire mitochondrial cytosolic membrane leaflet area as a novel sink for PI4P . This is far more effective than simply increasing the rate in the already available ER membrane surface area . ORP2 has previously been reported to facilitate counter - transport of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , as opposed to PI4P ( Koponen et al . , 2019 ; Takahashi et al . , 2021 ; Wang et al . , 2019a ) , which has also been reported for ORP5 and 8 in some studies ( Ghai et al . , 2017 ) but not others ( Chung et al . , 2015 ; Sohn et al . , 2018 ; Ikhlef et al . , 2021 ) . We found much more profound effects of ORP2 on steady - state PI4P than PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ( Fig . 5 ) . Why the discrepancy ? Yet another clue comes from the work on Osh6 and ORP8 ( Eisenreichova et al . , 2021 ; Ikhlef et al . , 2021 ) : here , ORD domains could bind both PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , but to have a higher affinity for the former . Additionally , cells are known to preserve PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 levels in the face of declining PI4P ( Hammond et al . , 2009 , 2012 ; Bojjireddy et al . , 2014 ) . In fact , they even possess a homeostatic mechanism that will preserve PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 levels at the expense of PI4P in the PM ( Wills et al . , 2022 ) . Therefore , it is possible for an ORP to remove PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , with or without PI4P , and still have a more profound impact on steady - state PI4P levels . Overall , the most parsimonious explanation for our data is that ORPs such as ORP2 remove PI4P from the PM and present it to SAC1 for hydrolysis in the ER . The turnover number for ORP proteins is quite low , estimated to be approximately 0 . 5 transfer cycles per second ( Lipp et al . , 2019 ; Mesmin et al . , 2013 ) . Recent proteomic data estimated that there are approximately 36 , 000 copies of ORP2 in a HEK cell ( Cho et al . , 2022 ) , giving an overall transfer rate of 18 , 000 PI4P per second . Given an estimated 10 million PI4P molecules per cell ( Wills and Hammond , 2022 ) , and assuming first order kinetics , the fractional rate constant , k , is 0 . 00036 s – 1 , giving a half - life ( ln2 / k ) of 1925 s , or 32 min – not dissimilar to our observations in control cells ( Fig . 3C ) . There is likely to be a minor contribution from ORP5 and 8 at the PM ( Sohn et al . , 2018 ) , though this will decline as membrane targeting of these proteins depends on the continued presence of PI4P . Of course , ORP2 does not function in cells principally as a PI4P degrader . It , like other ORPs , is thought to harness the energy of the PI4P gradient for antiport of a second lipid ( Arora et al . , 2022 ) . For ORP2 , that lipid is cholesterol ( Jansen et al . , 2011 ) . ORP2 has been shown to mediate the traffic of cholesterol between the ER and PM as well as endosomes ( Takahashi et al . , 2021 ; Koponen et al . , 2019 ; Wang et al . , 2019a ) . Clearly , there must be other determinants of 11 membrane targeting for ORP2 to the PM as opposed to the Golgi , where OSBP predominates PI4P / cholesterol exchange ( Mesmin et al . , 2013 , 2017 ) . The fact that cholesterol is synthesized in the ER , and distributed to the PM from here , means that our ectopic targeting of SAC1 to mitochondria likely does not result in productive exchange cycles . Indeed , this is likely the key reason why physiologically speaking , the ER is the “sink” for PI4P transfer . In conclusion , we discovered a surprising ability of SAC1 to enhance PM PI4P turnover , independent of the membrane it is targeted to – or the presence of membrane contact sites . The data implicate ORP2 , and non - membrane contact site - targeted transfer proteins in general , in PM PI4P turnover . Materials and Methods Plasmids The following plasmids were obtained as cited , or else generated by polymerase chain reaction and HiFi assembly ( New England Biolabs ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions : All plasmids were validated across the open reading frame by dideoxy sequencing . Cell Culture and Transfection COS - 7 cells ( ATCC CRL - 1651 ) were cultured in DMEM ( 5 . 56 mM glucose , glutaMAX supplement , Thermo Fisher 10567022 ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( ThermoFisher 10438 - 034 ) , 10 u / ml penicillin and 10 µg / ml streptomycin ( Thermofisher 15140122 ) and 1 % ( v / v ) chemically defined lipid supplement ( ThermoFisher 11905031 ) . They were passaged twice weekly by rinsing in phosphate buffered saline and dissociation in Trypsin like - enzyme ( ThermoFisher 12604039 ) before diluting 1 : 5 into fresh media . For transfection , cells were plated in 35 mm petri dishes with 20 mm aperture # 1 . 5 optical glass bottoms ( CellVis D35 - 20 - 1 . 5 - N ) coated with 5 µg / ml fibronectin ( ThermoFisher 33016 - 015 ) at 25 - 50 % confluence . Cells were transfected 1 - 24 h post seeding . For siRNA , 48 hours pre - cDNA transfection , cells were transfected with 50 pmol ORP2 smart pool ( Horizon Discovery L - 010361 - 01 - 0005 ) or siGENOME non - targeting pool ( Horizon Discovery D - 001206 - 13 - 05 ) pre - complexed with 6 . 6 µl DharmaFECT ( Horizon Discovery T - 2001 - 01 ) in 400 µl serum - free medium before diluting to 2 ml for addition to cells ( thus achieving a 25 nM final siRNA concetration ) . cDNA transfection was accomplished by the addition of 200 µl of Opti - MEM ( ThermoFisher 51985091 ) pre - complexed for > 20 min with 1 µg DNA and 3 µg lipofectamine 2000 ( ThermoFisher 11668019 ) ; DNA and lipofectamine were each diluted to 100 µl before combining . Specific plasmid mixtures are indicated in the figures . Prior to imaging , media was replaced with 2 ml of complete HEPES imaging media , composed of FluoroBrite media ( ThermoFisher A1896702 ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 1 % ( v / v ) chemically defined lipid supplement , 2 mM glutaMAX ( ThermoFisher 35050061 ) and 25 mM Na - HEPES , pH 7 . 4 . Confocal Microscopy A Nikon A1R - HD resonant scanning laser confocal microscope was used , mounted on a Nikon TiE inverted microscope stand . Images were collected through a 1 . 45 NA , plan apochromatic oil immersion objective ( Nikon ) . Green ( EGFP ) and far red ( iRFP713 ) fluorescence were co - excited using the 488 and 640 nm laser lines of a fiber - coupled LUN - V combiner , whereas red ( mCherry ) fluorescence was excited on a subsequent line scan to avoid cross talk , using the 561 nm laser line . Emission was collected using the following filters : green ( 505 - 550 nm ) , yellow - orange ( 570 - 620 nm ) and far - red ( 650 - 850 nm ) . Confocal planes were collected with a pinhole of 1 . 2 Airy Units calculated for the far - red channel in resonant mode with 8 or 16 frame averaging . For time lapse imaging , up to 10 fields of cells were selected using the motorized stage and imaged every 30 s . Addition of rapamycin was accomplished by pipetting 0 . 5 ml of complete HEPES imaging media containing 5 µM rapamycin ( Fisher Scientific BP2963 - 1 ) to the 2 ml already in the dish , achieving a final bath concentration of 1 µM . Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy A Nikon motorized TIRF illuminator mounted on a Nikon TiE inverted microscope stand was used . Laser excitation was fiber coupled from a four - line ( 405 , 488 , 561 and 638 nm ) combiner ( Oxxius ) . 12 Emission was collected through dual pass filters from Chroma : blue / yellow - orange ( 420 - 480 nm / 570 - 620 nm ) and green / far - red ( 505 - 550 nm / 650 - 850 nm ) .

HUGO Gene names and protein numbering are indicated . Human sequences were used unless a species is indicated ( except for fluorescent proteins ) . 13 camera . For time - lapse imaging , up to 10 individual fields were marked using the motorized stage and imaged every 30 s . 0 . 5 ml of 5 µM Rapamycin ( Fisher Scientific BP2963 - 1 ) + 150 nM GSK - A1 ( Sigma SML2453 ) were added after 2 min to achieve bath concentrations of 1 µM and 30 nM , respectively . Quantitative Image Analysis and Statistics For confocal image analysis , quantification of P4Mx2 signal at ER - PM or mitochondria - PM contact sites was accomplished by using the FRB - ER or mitochondria - FRB channels to generate a binary mask and measuring the normalized intensity of P4Mx2 inside this mask compared to outside . This and the auto thresholding procedure used to generate these masks has been outlined in detail in a recent protocols paper ( Wills et al . , 2021 ) . Briefly , the FRB images were Gaussian filtered at lengths defined by 1 and 2 multiples of the far red - fluor airy disc size ( for ER ) , or 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 times this size for mitochondria . Each filtered image was subtracted from the image filtered at next smallest length scale to generate wavelet images . These wavelets were multiplied together , and a threshold applied based on 0 . 5 standard deviations of the original image intensity , generating a binary mask . Finally , for mitochondria , the mask underwent a 2 - pixel dilation to effectively cover all mitochondrial area in the image . Analysis of TIRFM data was much simpler . After background subtraction , normalized intensity of the cell footprint was measured at each timepoint F t and normalized to the mean of the pre - stimulation intensity ( F pre ) . Data analysis , statistics and graphs were plotted using Graphpad Prism 9 . Details of statistical tests are given in the figure legends .
