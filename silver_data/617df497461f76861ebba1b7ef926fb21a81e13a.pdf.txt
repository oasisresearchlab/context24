A large body of work argues that scienti ﬁ c research increases the rate of technological advance , and with it economic growth . The precise mechanism through which science accelerates the rate of invention , however , remains an open question . Conceptualizing invention as a combinatorial search process , this paper argues that science alters inventors’ search processes , by leading them more directly to useful combinations , eliminating fruitless paths of research , and motivating them to continue even in the face of negative feedback . These mechanisms prove most useful when inventors attempt to combine highly coupled components ; therefore , the value of scienti ﬁ c research to invention varies systematically across applications . Empirical analyses of patent data support this thesis . Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . A long line of work supports the idea that scien - ti ﬁ c research stimulates technological innovation , thereby accelerating economic growth . Though one can trace this notion as far back as Adam Smith ( Stephan , 1996 ) , researchers did not begin empirically testing it until the second half of the twentieth century . One set of studies has focused on establishing the relationship between the invest - ments in , or outcomes of , scienti ﬁ c research and their effects on economic growth ( e . g . , Mans ﬁ eld , 1972 ; Rosenberg , 1974 ; Sveikauskas , 1981 ) . For instance , a paper by James Adams ( 1990 ) demon - strates that cumulative research output , in the form of published papers , appears to accelerate growth . Another set—typically drawing on either rich case histories or patent data—has investigated the more proximate linkages between scienti ﬁ c research and technological innovation .

Together , these complementary lines of research provide strong empirical support for a link between scien - ti ﬁ c research , technological innovation , and eco - nomic growth . Despite this evidence for the value of scien - ti ﬁ c research to innovation , inventors across ﬁ elds vary tremendously in the degree to which they make use of science . Universities , for example , disproportionately patent inventions in two broad sectors : drugs and medicine , and chemicals ( Hen - derson , Jaffe , and Trajtenberg , 1998 ) . Similarly , most studies detailing the bene ﬁ cial effects of spillovers from academic research to the private sector focus on biotechnology or pharmaceutical ﬁ rms ( e . g . , Henderson and Cockburn , 1994 ; Gam - bardella , 1995 ; Zucker and Darby , 1996 ; Zucker , Darby , and Brewer , 1998 ) . Why do inventors draw more heavily on scien - ti ﬁ c research in these areas ? Can institutional fac - tors account for the links between academics and Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . 910 L . Fleming and O . Sorenson ﬁ rms in particular sectors , or do industries differ in the potential returns available to the application of scienti ﬁ c research , thereby affecting the incentives faced by ﬁ rms ? Though institutional factors almost certainly play a role , Mans ﬁ eld ( 1995 ) contends that the bene ﬁ ts of applying science to invention differ across sectors ; for instance , pharmaceuti - cal ﬁ rms in his sample asserted that 27 percent of their inventions required the application of sci - ence to avoid costly delays , while electronics ﬁ rms made the same claim only 6 percent of the time . How do these ﬁ elds differ such that the application of science appears highly bene ﬁ cial in one , while of limited use in the next ? Answering this ques - tion requires us to examine technology at a ﬁ ner grain of detail ; progress in our understanding of the value of science , in the words of Richard Nelson , ‘would appear to require a better understanding of what knowledge actually does for inventing’ ( Nel - son , 1982 : 455 ) . To address this issue , this paper investigates the importance of science at the level of the individual invention , explicating one factor—the dif ﬁ culty of the inventive problem—that might in ﬂ uence the returns to the application of science at that level . We suggest that science proves most useful when inventors seek to combine tightly coupled com - ponents . Following a long tradition in the study of innovation ( e . g . , Gil ﬁ llan , 1935 ; Schumpeter , 1939 ) , we conceptualize invention as a process of searching for better combinations of existing components . When inventors seek to combine rel - atively independent components ( i . e . , those with a low degree of coupling ) , ﬁ nding useful new con ﬁ gurations proves relatively easy—any search algorithm can locate the most useful combinations . As the space searched becomes increasingly com - plex , however , local search routines break down , failing to identify the best combinations ( Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ) . In these cases , we posit that science may transform invention from a relatively haphazard search process to a more directed iden - ti ﬁ cation of useful new combinations , thus mitigat - ing the complications typically encountered when combining coupled components . Our empirical analyses estimate the returns to the application of science using patent data . Fol - lowing a common practice in studying patents , the future citation count provides our measure of the value of the resultant invention . We measure cou - pling by observing the ease with which subclasses have previously been recombined , and identify the use of science by noting when patents reference published articles in refereed scienti ﬁ c journals . Our results broadly support our expectations : sci - ence has no apparent effect when inventors work with relatively independent pieces ; it only appears bene ﬁ cial when inventors seek to combine highly coupled components—a particularly dif ﬁ cult task . INVENTION AS RECOMBINANT SEARCH Before considering how science alters the process of invention , one must ﬁ rst ask what inventors actually do . One popular view in the history of technology conceptualizes invention as a process of recombination . 1 Research out of this tradition holds that invention comes either from combining technological components in a novel manner ( Gil - ﬁ llan , 1935 ; Schumpeter , 1939 ; Usher , 1954 ; Nel - son and Winter , 1982 ; Basalla , 1988 ; Weitzman , 1996 ) , or through recon ﬁ guring existing combina - tions ( Henderson and Clark , 1990 ) . By ‘technolog - ical components , ’ we mean any fundamental bits of knowledge or matter that inventors might use to build inventions . For example , Gil ﬁ llan ( 1935 ) describes the steamship as a combination of the boat with a steam engine , or one might think of the computer workstation as a novel aggregation of several components and subsystems : a CPU , a motherboard , virtual storage and memory , a dis - play , graphics processors , as well as systems and applications software . Though complex physical systems quite clearly combine multiple elements , many inventions— such as nylon , a polymer—intuitively seem like one component , unbreakable without resorting to atomic - level decomposition . A closer look , how - ever , typically reveals that these inventions also arise from the recombination of discrete com - ponents and processes . For example , polymers involve the linkage of several molecules into a sub - stance with new properties ( Smith and Hounshell , 1985 ) . Moreover , innovation in these substances frequently occurs in the processes for producing them—often themselves recombinations of exist - ing manufacturing steps . For instance , after the 1 Other theorists view invention as exogenous shocks ( e . g . , Klepper , 1996 ) . Though this point of view undoubtedly has validity in many cases , it also relegates the invention process to a black box without ﬁ rst considering whether recombination might usefully characterize the process .

J . , 25 : 909 – 928 ( 2004 ) Science as a Map in Technological Search 911 initial synthesis of polymers , Wallace Carothers greatly increased polymer length by applying gen - tle heat in a molecular still , thereby eliminat - ing interference from water molecules ( Smith and Hounshell , 1985 ) . Alternatively , an inven - tion might involve the application of an exist - ing technology to a new purpose . Nylon once again provides a salient example . Though imme - diately recognized as a replacement for silk , the advent of World War II saw nylon’s application to parachutes , ﬂ ight suits , and glider towropes . Thus , conceiving of inventions as recombinations of existing components does not greatly limit our scope . The question remains , though , how do inventors search for these new inventions ? Local search Researchers most commonly point to local search —also referred to as exploitation—as the predom - inant algorithm used in innovation ( March and Simon , 1958 ; Cyert and March , 1963 ; Hansen and Lovas , 2004 ; Nelson and Winter , 1982 ; Stu - art and Podolny , 1996 ) . Local search implies that inventors typically alter one component at a time , either recon ﬁ guring it relative to the other compo - nents or replacing it with a different component ; in other words , inventors search incrementally . Traditional drug discovery , for example , follows this pattern ; after identifying a promising candi - date through high - throughput screening or luck , researchers attempt to ﬁ nd commercially viable drugs by slightly altering this initial candidate ( Drews , 2000 ) . The label ‘local’ refers to the fact that research activities relate quite closely to prior research activities , by de ﬁ nition implying some experience with the technologies being developed . Explanations for the prevalence of local search frequently focus on the value of experience . These accounts assume that inventors have an extremely limited understanding of the elements being recombined and the ways in which those elements interact—due to either cognitive limits or fundamental uncertainty ( March and Simon , 1958 ; Nelson , 1982 ; Vincenti , 1990 ) . As inventors gain experience , they develop some ( possibly mistaken ) understanding of the components that allows them to invent with greater reliability by avoiding elements that did not work in the past ( Vincenti , 1990 ) . Nevertheless , local search also has a downside : focusing on familiar combinations can preclude the inventor from investigating more distant—and potentially more useful—possibilities ; as inventors continue to work with a particular set of components , they may exhaust the set of useful combinations ( March , 1991 ; Fleming , 2001 ) . Empirical research supports the prevalence and effects of local search across a variety of levels . At the ﬁ rm level , Stuart and Podolny ( 1996 ) , in an analysis of semiconductor patents , show that ﬁ rms’ new patents concentrate in areas techno - logically proximate to their existing patent port - folios—a tendency that increases as ﬁ rms mature , potentially leading to obsolescence ( Sørensen and Stuart , 2000 ; see also Ahuja and Lampert , 2001 ) . Similar results appear in research on new prod - ucts : Audia and Sorenson ( 2001 ) ﬁ nd that com - puter workstation manufacturers tend to introduce new products with features similar to their existing offerings ( cf . Martin and Mitchell , 1998 ) , a prac - tice that retards future sales growth . In research at the community of practice level , Fleming ( 2001 ) demonstrates that experience at this level does indeed appear to enhance search , both by increas - ing the average value of inventions and by decreas - ing the variability of outcomes , but this bene ﬁ cial effect eventually succumbs to exhaustion . Science and search Scienti ﬁ c knowledge , by contrast , may lead to a very different type of search ; in effect , it pro - vides inventors with the equivalent of a map—a stylized representation of the area being searched . Though local search portrays inventors as rummag - ing around , blindly bumping along in the search for new technologies , they can also proceed with greater foresight ( Vincenti , 1990 ) . For example , studies of engineers have found that they some - times consult the scienti ﬁ c literature to resolve technological dif ﬁ culties ( Gibbons and Johnston , 1974 ; Allen , 1977 ) . Scienti ﬁ c knowledge differs from that derived through local search , in par - ticular , because the scienti ﬁ c endeavor attempts to generate and test theories . Science attempts to explain why phenomena occur , providing a means of predicting the results of untried experiments and the usefulness of previously uncombined con - ﬁ gurations of technological components . Having an understanding of the fundamental problem—a map—likely modi ﬁ es the search process in mul - tiple , complementary ways . Notably , it might lead inventors quite directly to the proper combinations Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 909 – 928 ( 2004 ) 912 L . Fleming and O . Sorenson of components to solve a particular technical prob - lem . Even absent such a direct linkage , science could usefully increase the effectiveness of search by identifying useless directions of search before - hand , and by providing a glimpse of the possible . Theoretical understanding of the underlying properties of technological components and their interactions may facilitate effective search . Lipp - man and McCall ( 1976 ) argue that this advan - tage stems from the ability to assess alternatives ‘of ﬂ ine’—in essence , running the experiment in one’s mind or on paper without incurring the costs of actually performing the test . For example , lay - ing the groundwork for a future generation of chip technology , researchers predicted that single - wall carbon nano - tubes would either conduct or semi - conduct , depending on the diameter of the tube and the angles of the carbon bonds ( Dresselhaus , 2001 ) . This prediction pointed to two speci ﬁ c con - ﬁ gurations ( out of an essentially in ﬁ nite number of possibilities ) that resulted in the successful fabrica - tion of conducting and semiconducting nano - tubes ( Ouyang et al . , 2001 ) . The theory did not predict everything and researchers must still engage in trial - and - error search to produce working transis - tors . Theoretical guidance nonetheless accelerated the researchers’ arrival at the proper diameter and angles . Maps typically do not detail every rock and crevice dotting the landscape ; similarly , sci - enti ﬁ c theories do not predict every property and interaction of a new combination of technological components . Theory may still get researchers ‘in the ballpark , ’ thereby leading them to a promising new invention more ef ﬁ ciently . By eliminating fruitless avenues , science may also play the more modest role of reducing the size of the combinatorial search pace ( Nelson , 1982 ) . In other words , science can tell inventors how to avoid wasted effort . Consider the clas - sic goal of alchemy : transforming lead into gold . Once people understood the structure and proper - ties of atoms , it became quite clear that anything short of a nuclear reaction would not yield the desired results . More recently , researchers at Lord Manufacturing Company switched from work - ing with electro - rheological materials to magneto - rheological materials in their effort to develop controllable ﬂ uids . Even after 10 years of fruit - less effort with electrical approaches , the switch occurred only after the lead researcher , Dave Carl - son , investigated the physics of the materials and calculated that the potential power available from the use of magnetic ﬁ elds exceeded the potential of electrical ﬁ elds by two orders of magnitude ( Carlson , 2001 ; Stix , 2001 ) . Without realizing the futility of the search , researchers at Lord may have pursued an unobtainable goal inde ﬁ nitely ; thus , science improves the ef ﬁ cacy of search by pre - venting inventors from wasting valuable effort on the impossible . Even when science has an inaccurate or incom - plete understanding of the problem , it might still alter the search process in a useful manner . When inventors experiment with combinations and con - ﬁ gurations of components , most of the iterations that they try will fail to yield useful outcomes . In the absence of a predictive model of the prob - lem , inventors constantly face the question of how long they should persist with a failing approach . Should they quit after 10 , 100 , or 1000 failures ? By suggesting that an avenue of solution might suc - ceed theoretically , science can encourage inventors to continue working with a seemingly unfruitful set of components . Consider the case of Prozac . Bryan Molloy began Eli Lilly’s research with local search , deriving hundreds of benadryl com - pounds ( Kramer , 1997 : 62 ) . They all failed . His colleague David Wong continued the search , how - ever , because he believed a theory that blocking serotonin uptake , a property of benadryl deriva - tives , held the key to treating depression . Using a new experimental technique that enabled more accurate evaluation , Wong tested the same com - pounds as Molloy and demonstrated the ef ﬁ cacy of one of them , ﬂ uoxetine ( the chemical name for Prozac ) . In addition to motivating inventors in the face of failure , the belief that something better might exist could also lead them to con - tinue searching even after having found acceptable solutions ( Gavetti and Levinthal , 2000 , provide a similar argument for the usefulness of managerial frameworks in strategic search ) . Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of these search processes also requires an understand - ing of the spaces being searched ; thus , we turn to a discussion of technological landscapes . TECHNOLOGY LANDSCAPES Landscapes offer a useful heuristic for think - ing about the space that inventors must search when attempting to discover useful new inven - tions . Wright ( 1932 ) ﬁ rst introduced the idea of a Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 909 – 928 ( 2004 ) Science as a Map in Technological Search 913 ﬁ tness landscape to describe the evolution of traits in species . Since then , the idea has been applied usefully to topics ranging from spin - glasses in physics ( Weinberger , 1991 ) to organizational rou - tines ( Levinthal , 1997 ; Rivkin , 2000 ) . This same metaphor can help us understand technological search . Think of each possible set of compo - nents as corresponding to a particular technolog - ical landscape that inventors search ; positions on these landscapes represent different con ﬁ gurations of components . Inventors search new landscapes when they combine new sets of components and move across these landscapes when they recon - ﬁ gure a particular set of components . The peaks and higher elevations represent more useful con - ﬁ gurations . Technological landscapes can take a variety of shapes . At one extreme , the landscape might smoothly slope up to a single peak ; at the other , it might jump around with treacherous val - leys and soaring zeniths . Thus , one might ask , what determines the topography of these technological landscapes ? One important factor in ﬂ uencing the shape of these landscapes is coupling . By ‘coupling , ’ we mean the degree to which components interact in determining the functionality of the overall inven - tion . 2 A rugged landscape implies that adjacent points of the terrain differ dramatically in their usefulness . Coupled technologies exhibit precisely such a characteristic : the functionality of cou - pled inventions overall becomes highly sensitive to minor changes in the individual components ( Ulrich , 1995 ) . For example , a change of one par - ticle in 10 million of semiconductor dopant can change its conductivity by a factor of 10 thou - sand ( Millman , 1979 ) . 3 In contrast , independent components—those with no coupling—gradually change the functionality of the overall system , with each component contributing individually to 2 This idea goes by a variety of monikers in different literatures . Milgrom and Roberts ( 1990 ) refer to it as complementarity . Kauffman ( 1993 ) and Sorenson ( 2002 ) call it interdependence , and many use the term modularity to refer to the inverse of interdependence ( e . g . , Baldwin and Clark , 2000 ) . Given our technological context , we prefer Ulrich’s ( 1995 ) de ﬁ nition of coupling : ‘Two components are coupled if a change made to one component requires a change to the other component for the overall product to work correctly . ’ 3 Other examples abound . The ﬂ uoxetine molecule resembles other benadryl derivatives quite closely , yet it provides much more effective relief against depression ( Kramer , 1997 ) . Super - conductor research continues to ﬁ nd unexpectedly high temper - ature breakthroughs with novel combinations of common mate - rials , such as boron ( Campbell , 2001 ) . overall usefulness . Kauffman ( 1993 ) presents this relationship in stark simplicity . His simulations include two parameters : the number of compo - nents and the degree of interaction between those components . These simulations characterize the landscapes produced by different types of com - ponents ; interacting components create more jum - bled , uncorrelated landscapes , while independent elements generate a landscape with a single peak . In short , the ruggedness of the technological land - scape increases as the degree of coupling among the components intensi ﬁ es . Landscapes and search Combining these landscapes with a search algo - rithm allows us to make predictions regarding the likely outcomes of inventive search . Consider local search . When inventors search locally , they move across adjacent positions on the ﬁ tness landscape . Although gradually climbing uphill will eventually bring the inventor to an optimum , this peak might not represent the ‘best , ’ or even a particularly ‘good , ’ con ﬁ guration . Rather , the topography of the landscape importantly affects the ef ﬁ cacy of the search algorithm . Local search processes work best on smooth , correlated landscapes because incre - mental improvements more frequently ﬁ nd the global maximum . In contrast , local search pro - cesses operate less effectively on jumbled , uneven , and uncorrelated landscapes . On these landscapes , local search processes yield unpredictable out - comes and often trap the searcher on a local peak because any incremental change yields less desir - able outcomes ( March , 1991 ; Kauffman , 1993 ) . Inventors who search incrementally with strongly coupled components make slow progress and have no assurance of ultimate success . Although coupling between components makes the search process more dif ﬁ cult , it also cre - ates the potential for very useful inventions . On ﬂ at landscapes , inventors searching locally can ﬁ nd the optima , but few exist and those that do rise only modestly above alternative con ﬁ g - urations ( i . e . , they offer minimal gains in use - fulness ) . Competitors may also ﬁ nd these inno - vations easy to imitate ( Rivkin , 2000 ) . Rugged landscapes contain a large number of potentially useful con ﬁ gurations , if inventors can only ﬁ nd them . Together these processes generate a non - monotonic relationship between the usefulness of Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 909 – 928 ( 2004 ) 914 L . Fleming and O . Sorenson inventions found through local search and the cou - pling of the components combined ( Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ) . On ﬂ at landscapes—those with little coupling—local search can locate the high - est peak , but that apex offers limited functionality . At low levels of coupling , somewhat rugged land - scapes provide a larger number of taller peaks that inventors can still ﬁ nd through local search . As the coupling increases , however , the dif ﬁ culty of search rises , and the average usefulness of inven - tions declines . Coupling also increases the uncer - tainty of invention . As the number of unpredictable interactions rises , the uncertainty , or variability , of the expected outcomes also increases . Fleming and Sorenson ( 2001 ) ﬁ nd strong support for this model , using patent citations as a measure of invention usefulness . By contrast , inventors can proceed quite dif - ferently when science provides them with some understanding of the underlying landscape . The exact effect of this process on inventive outcomes depends on how science in ﬂ uences the search pro - cess . Consider the ﬁ rst mechanism : cheap of ﬂ ine experimentation . If science allows a rough predic - tion of the expected interactions between coupled components , it should allow inventors to move quite directly toward the highest peaks—the most useful con ﬁ gurations—on the landscape , thereby reducing the variability of inventive outcomes . As the potential for useful inventions increases with coupling , it should also allow inventors to exploit synergies more effectively ; thus , the average use - fulness of inventions should rise with coupling when inventors use science . It might also reduce the number of times that inventors use the same combinations of components since they can ef ﬁ - ciently focus on the most useful con ﬁ gurations while avoiding the rest . Even if science plays the more modest role of allowing inventors to rule out unfruitful direc - tions , our second mechanism , this narrowing of options should have a similar—though less pro - nounced—bene ﬁ cial effect . One would still expect an improvement in the average usefulness of inventions , as researchers avoid the worst regions of the solution space . The variability of outcomes would likely remain high , however , as even the best regions in ﬁ tness landscapes of highly coupled components include peaks and valleys ( Kauffman , 1993 ) . Under the third mechanism , motivation , the expected effects of science on search may differ . Having some sense of the height and location of the tallest peak may lead inventors to better out - comes by preventing them from becoming trapped in local optima ( Gavetti and Levinthal , 2000 ) . However , in this case , inventors might actually search more when directed by science because they will continue to look for better alternatives even after ﬁ nding ‘good’ ones . In the words of Gavetti and Levinthal ( 2000 ) , they may begin ‘chasing cognitive rainbows . ’ EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS Studying how science affects the process of inven - tion can prove quite dif ﬁ cult and , as a result , much of the work on this topic relies on careful case stud - ies . Though useful , these studies lack the statistical power necessary to distinguish potential patterns linking science and invention from random noise . Thus , we analyzed patent data to examine the role of science . Patent data admittedly offer imperfect measures of invention . Companies sometimes avoid patent - ing , and industries vary in their propensities to patent ( Levin et al . , 1987 ) . Patents also do not allow us to observe all points on the ﬁ tness land - scape . Because inventors may limit their patent applications to their most successful inventions , patents likely represent only the higher positions on these landscapes . This implies that we must infer the topography of the underlying landscape from truncated data . 4 Despite these imperfections , patents do offer a window into the process of invention , allowing us to develop a quantitative measure of ﬁ tness across a broad range of tech - nologies , to identify those inventions in which sci - ence likely played a role , and to develop a measure of component coupling—the variables needed to investigate our proposition empirically . We col - lected information on all U . S . patents granted in May and June of 1990 ( n = 17 , 264 ) 5 listed in the Micro - Patent product ; from these , we excluded the 4 Simulations demonstrate , however , that increases in the mean of a normal distribution generate corresponding increased means in right truncated observations ; thus , these truncated observations should still allow us to observe the rough structure of the technology landscapes ( Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ) . 5 We chose 1990 to allow suf ﬁ cient time to observe future citation patterns , our dependent variable ; we used a random number generator to select the starting month , May , and included only 2 months of data due to resource limitations ( calculation of the coupling measure required months of CPU time and the Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 909 – 928 ( 2004 ) Science as a Map in Technological Search 915 442 patents that do not cite any prior art ( previ - ous work in the area ) because these patents may lie beyond our theory , involving the discovery of fun - damental new components rather than the recom - bination of previous technologies ( their inclusion does not change the results ) . Thus , our analyses include 16 , 822 patents granted in May and June of 1990 . Key variables Science We began by identifying when science likely in ﬂ u - enced the process of invention . Much of the work linking science to invention focuses only on research that occurs at a university or public research institution ( e . g . , Henderson et al . , 1998 ) . Since science also gets applied outside the univer - sity context ( Narin , Hamilton , and Olivastro , 1997 ; Cockburn , Henderson , and Stern 2000 ) , we took a different approach , identifying the usage of science through non - patent references ( Narin et al . , 1997 ; Perko and Narin , 1997 ) . 6 We took a reference to the scienti ﬁ c litera - ture as an indication that the inventor made use of—or at least had some awareness of—scienti ﬁ c knowledge in the process of invention . In addi - tion to citing the prior art ( previous patents ) , U . S . coding of the non - patent references involved hundreds of hours of research assistance ) . 6 Though Schmoch ( 1993 ) and Meyer ( 2000 ) question the use of the non - patent references as indicators of the direct application of science , their contention that these references simply denote a relationship between the technology and science ﬁ ts well with our assumption of their meaning . patents also cite a variety of non - patent litera - ture . Our sample made 16 , 698 references to the non - patent literature ( Table 1 ) . The majority of these non - patent references ( 67 % ) cite journals listed in the Scienti ﬁ c Index : a publication that covers peer - reviewed scienti ﬁ c journals . 7 Unlike references to patent prior art , often added by the patent examiner , non - patent references more frequently come from the inventors themselves ; Tijssen ( 2001 ) reports that 81 percent of patents with non - patent references include an inventor’s citation to their own scienti ﬁ c work . Thus , non - patent references provide a reasonable indicator of the in ﬂ uence of science ; as Tijssen notes , ‘these citations at the very least indicate an awareness of scienti ﬁ c results with some indirect bearing on ele - ments of the invention . In the best case , they re ﬂ ect strong evidence of substantial direct contributions of scienti ﬁ c inputs to breakthrough technological innovations’ ( Tijssen , 2001 : 52 ) . 8 A dummy vari - able indicates if a patent referenced one of these publications . 9 7 References to science most commonly appear in the following classes : 505 Superconductor technology ( 85 % ) , 530 Natural resins and derivatives ( 81 % ) , 435 Molecular biology ( 78 % ) , 512 Perfumes ( 71 % ) , 548 Organic compounds ( 69 % ) . 8 In our own survey of inventors ( detailed below ) , 62 percent of inventors indicated an awareness of the speci ﬁ c scienti ﬁ c papers cited on their patents and 71 percent reported a awareness of the broader scienti ﬁ c literature on the subject . Though our results suggest a weaker link than Tijssen ( possibly because we draw a representative sample of all patents while Tijssen selects on patents citing Dutch science ) , non - patent references to the scienti ﬁ c literature still appear a good proxy for the availability of scienti ﬁ c knowledge to inventors . 9 Using a count of the number of scienti ﬁ c articles referenced in place of this dummy variable produced qualitatively equivalent results ; including both a dummy and the count reveals that the count adds no signi ﬁ cant information to the models .

Sorenson Coupling Next we characterized the dif ﬁ culty of the inven - tive problem according to the degree of coupling among the components . Our measure essentially observes the degree to which an invention’s com - ponents have been previously recombined . 10 To calculate this measure , we used the subclass ref - erences on each patent . In effect , we treated the subclass assignments as proxies for the underly - ing components that combine to create that inven - tion . The U . S . Patent Of ﬁ ce uses subclass refer - ences to indicate which technologies relate to the patent , developing and updating these subclasses such that they consistently track technology back to 1790 . 11 The approximately 100 , 000 subclasses also investigated classifying technical references together with Scienti ﬁ c Index journal cites as indicators of science ; using this more inclusive de ﬁ nition yielded weaker , but substantively identical , results . 10 Economists seeking to identify complementarity—a closely related concept—have also proposed using the realized combi - nations of activities to identify the pattern and strength of these interdependencies ( Athey and Stern , 1998 ) . 11 The Patent Of ﬁ ce often redraws the boundaries of patent subclasses and retroactively reassigns patents to subclasses based on these changes . This system has the advantage of making subclasses usable over time ; however , this reclassi ﬁ cation likely allow for ﬁ ne - grained classi ﬁ cation of inventions ( Trajtenberg , Henderson , and Jaffe , 1997 ) . Though in many cases subclasses correspond quite closely to physical components ( such as the example in Figure 1 ) , they do not always match so well . Our measure , however , only requires that these sub - classes de ﬁ ne pieces of knowledge rather than identi ﬁ able physical components . Combining some pieces which interact sensitively to each other proves more dif ﬁ cult than connecting relatively independent chunks of knowledge . We calculated our measure of coupling in two stages . Equation 1 details our measurement of the observed ease of recombination , or inverse of coupling , of an individual subclass i used in patent j . The score increases as a particular sub - class combines with a wider variety of subclasses , controlling for the total number of applications ; thus , it captures the observed ease with which a component has been recombined . Since most patents ( 92 % ) belong to more that one subclass of technology , we averaged the inverse of these subclass scores to create a patent - level measure introduces noise into our measure of coupling , making our tests of its effects more conservative . We used the concordance of 1996 for our calculations . 326 / 16 : Test facilitate feature E i = 205 / 116 = 1 . 77 326 / 31 : Switching threshold stabilization E i = 104 / 69 = 1 . 51 Average observed ease of recombination = ( 1 . 77 + 2 . 02 + 1 . 21 + 1 . 51 ) / 4 = 1 . 63 = > K j = 0 . 61 326 / 56 : Tristate E i = 158 / 131 = 1 . 21 326 / 82 : Current driving fan in / out , E i = 101 / 50 = 2 . 02 Figure 1 .

We computed this measure using the entire 200 years of pre - sample history and tested its robustness to temporal bias with a 10 - year window . Observed ease of recombination of subclass i ≡ E i = Count of subclasses previously combined with subclass i Count of previous patents in subclass i ( 1 ) Coupling of patent j ≡ K j = Count of subclasses on patent j (cid:1) j ∈ i E i ( 2 ) As an example of the coupling calculation , con - sider one of the ﬁ rst author’s patents , # 5 , 136 , 185 . Figure 1 illustrates calculation of the measure and the correspondence between the USPTO classi ﬁ - cation scheme and the components used , all stan - dard elements described in digital design text - books at the time of invention ( see , for exam - ple , McCluskey , 1986 ) . 326 / 16 identi ﬁ es the ‘Test facilitate feature’ subclass , which implements a testing mode within a semiconductor chip . Prior to the author’s use of this component ( i . e . , subclass ) , it had been recombined 116 times with 205 other components , implying an observed ease of recom - bination score of 205 / 116 = 1 . 77 . 326 / 56 indi - cates the ‘Tristate subclass’ , and 326 / 82 points to ‘Current driving fan in / out . ’ 326 / 31 identi ﬁ es the ‘Switching threshold stabilization’ subclass ( essen - tially a priority encoder ) . Figure 1 illustrates the location of these components on the circuit , and the calculation of their ease of recombination scores , as well as the calculation of the patent’s coupling score of 0 . 61 . This score , slightly below the mean value of 0 . 63 , seems reasonable as digital hardware recombines with relative ease . To validate the measure across a wider range of technologies , we surveyed inventors about the coupling of the components of their inventions . Randomly choosing 0 . 2 percent of U . S . patents granted to U . S . inventors in the year 2000 gave us a sample of 199 patents . Of these , we located current contact information for the patent holders for 189 , from which we received responses in 64 cases . To assess the coupling between an invention’s com - ponents , we asked ( from Ulrich , 1995 ) , ‘Modules are said to be coupled when a change made to one module requires a change to the other module ( s ) in order for the overall invention to work correctly . How coupled were the modules of your inven - tion ? ’ The Pearson correlation coef ﬁ cient between the responses and our measure of coupling is 0 . 30 ( p ∼ 0 . 03 ) ; though not perfect , the relationship is highly signi ﬁ cant . 12 Most importantly , our auto - mated procedure allows us to analyze a large set of patents , and appears to provide at least a rough estimate of coupling . Invention usefulness We de ﬁ ned usefulness as the number of citations that a patent receives in the 5 years following its grant date . 13 Each patent by law must cite previous patents that relate closely to its own technology . Research demonstrates that the number of cita - tions a patent receives correlates highly with its technological importance , as measured by expert opinions , social value , and industry awards ( Tra - jtenberg , 1990 ; Albert et al . , 1991 ) . It also corre - sponds closely to the economic value of an inven - tion ( Harhoff et al . , 1999 , Hall , Jaffe , and Trajten - berg , 2000 ) . Thus , citation counts offer a means of measuring inventive usefulness across a broad range of technologies . 14 Descriptive statistics for these variables , as well as the others used in the models , appear in Table 2 . Science , coupling , and citations One can see the relationship between science , cou - pling , and the usefulness of the inventions even without running a complex statistical analysis . Figure 2 depicts this relationship graphically : the points plot the mean number of citations received against the average level of coupling for each quin - tile of the coupling distribution . It plots this rela - tionship separately for patents that cite a scienti ﬁ c 12 While we provided inventors with speci ﬁ c de ﬁ nitions of how they should think about their subsystems and components , they may still have placed different boundaries in the organization of their inventions . This would increase the error of our measure . Increased error , however , should only dampen our estimates of the effects of coupling , making our empirical tests more conservative . 13 We chose this period to capture the bulk of the citations to a patent , as citations typically peak about 3 years after the grant date ( Jaffe , Trajtenberg , and Henderson , 1993 ) . Although citation rates to patents appear quite consistent over time , we tested the sensitivity of this assumption by also using a 10 - year window of citation counts ; the results remain robust across both . 14 The propensity to cite does vary across technologies as a function of the level of activity in that technology . We introduce multiple methods for controlling for this heterogeneity below . Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 909 – 928 ( 2004 ) 918 L . Fleming and O .

Mean citations ( ± 1 S . E . M . ) across quintiles of the coupling variable article and for those that do not . Patents that refer - ence science receive more cites on average . More importantly , the ﬁ gure illustrates the predicted pos - itive interaction effect . One can clearly see that while the relationship between coupling and cita - tions ﬁ rst rises and then falls for patents that do not cite science , those that do reference an article in the Scienti ﬁ c Index show a positive relation - ship between coupling and citations . Even at this cursory level , the data support the claim that sci - ence helps most when inventors attempt a dif ﬁ cult recombination task . Multivariate analysis To investigate the process in more detail and to control for a variety of factors , we estimated ﬁ xed effects negative binomial models of future cita - tions . The dependent variable of citation counts takes on only whole number values ( i . e . 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 . . . ) . Using linear regression on such data can yield inef ﬁ cient , inconsistent , and biased coef ﬁ - cient estimates . Count models can avoid these problems ( Cameron and Trivedi , 1998 ) . We em - ployed one particular variant suggested by Haus - man , Hall , and Griliches ( 1984 ) : the ﬁ xed effects Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 909 – 928 ( 2004 ) Science as a Map in Technological Search 919 negative binomial . This procedure usefully allows for overdispersion—where the variance exceeds the mean—which these data exhibit . It also allows us to control broadly for differences across tech - nological domains by de ﬁ ning ﬁ xed effects at the level of the USPTO class . 15 In this case , using the ﬁ xed effects negative binomial amounts to taking the number of citations received by all patents in a particular class as a given and estimating which factors predict the distribution of those citations among the patents within the class . Several measures captured other potential sources of heterogeneity . First , we developed a technology control , which essentially re ﬁ nes the ﬁ xed effects . In the ﬁ rst stage , we calculated the average number of citations that each patent in a particular USPTO class received from patents granted between January of 1985 and June of 1990 ( Equation 3 ) . 16 We weighted these param - eters according to the patent’s class assignments ( Equation 4 ) , where p indicates the proportion of patent k ’s subclass memberships that fall in class i . Average citations in patent class i ≡ µ i = (cid:1) j ∈ i Citations j ( before 7 / 90 ) Count of patents j in subclass i ( 3 ) Technology mean control patent k ≡ M k = p ik µ i ( 4 ) To augment our technology control , we included several additional variables . We incorporated a count of the number of major classes . Patents that cover a broad range of technologies may carry a higher risk of being cited simply because future inventions from each ﬁ eld might potentially cite them—similar to what happens when an aca - demic article spans several literatures . This mea - sure also controls for the interdisciplinary breadth 15 In unreported analyses , we also de ﬁ ned ﬁ xed effects at the level of the inventing ﬁ rm , with qualitatively equivalent results . Thus , ﬁ rm - level differences cannot account for our results . 16 We allow all patents issued between January 1985 and June 30 , 1990 to enter the estimation of the technology control , meaning that the patents used to calculate it vary in the time during which they can receive citations . Alternatively , we could select a small set of patents from 1985 and base the measures on the subsequent 5 years of citations ; however , this approach would ignore the patent activity just prior to our sample . of the invention . 17 We also included the number of prior art citations —references to prior patents assigned by the U . S . Patent Of ﬁ ce—as a control for the degree of local search ( Podolny and Stuart , 1995 ) ; it may also capture idiosyncratic differ - ences in citation propensity that our technological class controls miss . We additionally measured pre - vious local search as the number of repeated trials on a particular landscape ( Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , we counted the number of pre - vious patents that combined exactly the same set of subclasses . We control for the number of components or problem domains in an invention by including the number of subclasses . Eight percent of the patents in our data belong to only one subclass . Although we suspect that these inventions also arise from a process of recombination—as the prior art ref - erences in these patents reveals , they do build on previous inventions—this combination occurs at a ﬁ ner grain than our measures can capture . There - fore , we added a single subclass dummy variable to capture any systematic differences between these inventions and those assigned to multiple sub - classes . A recent technology control accounts for any differences in citation patterns for technolo - gies closer to the ‘cutting edge’ ( Katila , 2002 ) ; we calculated this variable by averaging the patent numbers of the prior art cited . 18 Finally , we con - trolled for the cumulative science stock in a ﬁ eld of technology by calculating the percentage of patents up to 1990 that cite a non - patent reference in the same primary subclass as the focal patent . Table 3 presents the correlations between these variables , as well as those of theoretical interest . The results of the ﬁ xed effects negative bino - mial models appear in Table 4 . Model 1 provides a baseline . After controlling for a variety of factors , strong coupling generates an even stronger nega - tive effect on citations than suggested by Figure 2 . Science clearly has a positive effect on citation counts . The fact that this effect persists while con - trolling for the science stock reveals that these bene ﬁ ts accrue speci ﬁ cally to the patents drawing 17 Unreported models indicated that coupling actually decreases the likelihood that a patent receives citations from other classes . Hence , our measure of coupling does not appear to pick up the breadth of application . 18 Because patenting occurs at a relatively constant rate , this measure correlates at roughly 0 . 99 with the average age of the patent’s prior art measured in terms of days .

J . , 25 : 909 – 928 ( 2004 ) Science as a Map in Technological Search 921 on science , rather than to all patents in a particu - lar technological area . The primary test of the role of science appears in Model 2 ; this model inter - acts coupling with whether or not the patent cites a journal in the Scienti ﬁ c Index . The interaction signi ﬁ cantly improves the model ( χ 2 = 9 . 8 , d . f . = 2 ) 19 and shows that while coupling has a non - monotonic relationship with citations for patents that do not cite science , the relationship remains positive for patents citing science . Because of this fact , the bene ﬁ ts to science increase with coupling : at the mean level of coupling , patents that refer - ence science receive 9 . 5 percent more citations than those that do not ; at one standard devia - tion above the mean on coupling , the advantage increases to 13 . 1 percent ; and at two standard devi - ations it reaches 20 . 3 percent . Model 3 tests the robustness of our measure of coupling by substi - tuting a measure based only on the 10 - year window preceding our sample rather than on the entire his - tory of the U . S . Patent Of ﬁ ce . The relationship between science and the effects of coupling remain the same . Still , one might also ask whether scienti ﬁ c knowledge in ﬂ uences the process of search in a different manner from empirical knowledge ( expe - rience ) . Model 4 investigates this proposition by interacting the number of trials—a measure of the technological community’s experience with a set of components—with coupling . The results reveal that , unlike science , experience does not mitigate the detrimental effects of high coupling , strongly corroborating the notion that search with the aid of science differs fundamentally from local search . Unreported models also attempted interac - tions , following Podolny and Stuart ( 1995 ) , with the number of prior art citations as an indicator of local search ; these models similarly failed to ﬁ nd an interaction between local search and interde - pendence . If science helps inventors predict the results of their recombinant search , it should also reduce the variance of search outcomes—the uncertainty of invention . Thus , we analyzed the residuals from the negative binomial models to determine whether science reduced the variation in the usefulness of inventive outcomes . Table 5 presents ordinary least 19 Haberman’s ( 1977 ) chi - squared , two times the difference in log - likelihoods , provides a test of the statistical signi ﬁ cance of the difference between two nested models .

As one would expect if science helps direct inventors , science reduces the disper - sion of outcomes as the degree of coupling rises . At the mean level of coupling , the application of science reduced variability by 6 . 5 percent ; at one standard deviation above the mean , this reduction in risk increases to 9 . 0 percent . Robustness checks Some additional robustness checks appear in Table 6 . Models 6 and 7 examine the importance of the de ﬁ nition of the dependent variable . In particular , Model 6 excludes self - citations ( when the future citing patent belongs to the same assignee ) from the dependent variable . Self - citations may differ in their meaning from citations by competitors—notably Sørensen and Stuart ( 2000 ) interpret self - citations as an indicator that the organization’s patents may not ﬁ t the current state of the market ; thus , self - citations have an ambiguous role as a measure of patent importance . The results hold , however , even when excluding self - citations from the dependent variable . Model 7 increases to 10 years the length of the future 20 In unreported analyses , we estimated the mean and variance effects simultaneously , using the variance decomposition nega - tive binomial ( King , 1989 ) . Simultaneous estimation produced equivalent results . The variance decomposition negative bino - mial , however , has the disadvantage of not being able to incor - porate ﬁ xed effects ; thus , we report the two - stage estimation .

If knowledge diffuses at different rates across technologies , and these rates correlate to the usage of science , this process might in ﬂ uence our results . Regardless , our models continue to show a non - monotonic relationship between coupling and citations for patents that do not cite a Scienti ﬁ c Index journal , and a strictly positive relationship between coupling and future citations for those referencing science . One potential alternate explanation for these results involves the diffusion of knowledge . Ref - erences to non - patent sources might speed the dissemination of information , allowing communi - ties of practice to build knowledge more rapidly . Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 909 – 928 ( 2004 ) Science as a Map in Technological Search 923 This account implies that the mere act of pub - lishing increases the ﬂ ow of information , thereby increasing citation rates . Model 8 tests this pos - sibility directly by interacting the effects of cou - pling with whether or not the patent references a non - scienti ﬁ c publication . 21 A reference to these publications does nothing to mitigate the effect of coupling , failing to support this account . The diffusion story further suggests that references to science should uniformly increase citations , rather than primarily increasing citation rates for inven - tions combining coupled technologies . Since the citation to science main effect has no impact on future citations , the models also fail to support this account on that basis . Variation in knowledge dif - fusion does not appear to account for our ﬁ ndings . Another potential explanation for our ﬁ ndings concerns the effort invested in solving the inven - tive problem . Science may denote a greater level of effort that proves particularly useful in the face of dif ﬁ cult technological challenges . Although we cannot measure effort directly , the number of inventors may proxy for this factor . 22 Nevertheless , in both cases using and not using science , cou - pling correlates negatively and signi ﬁ cantly with the number of inventors listed on the patent . The evidence , therefore , suggests that we can dismiss this alternative . A more serious critique might contend that patents that cite science differ in some other sys - tematic way from those that do not . To investigate this possibility , we ﬁ rst estimated a logistic regres - sion of whether or not a patent cited a Scienti ﬁ c Index journal ( see Table 7 ) . Even after control - ling for differences across technologies using class ﬁ xed effects ( Model 11 ) , these estimates reveal some differences between those patents that ref - erence science and those that do not . First , patents that draw on science tend to come from highly active research domains , as the positive and sig - ni ﬁ cant coef ﬁ cients for both the number of prior art citations and the number of trials reveal . This ﬁ nding suggests that science does not differ from non - science by identifying fundamental new com - ponents . Second , patents drawing on science more 21 We coded any patent that referenced a journal not in the Scienti ﬁ c Index ( e . g . , Time ) or a non - technical corporate publi - cation—usually a product catalog or advertisement—as having a non - scienti ﬁ c reference because these publication types most clearly do not involve the application of scienti ﬁ c theory . 22 Thanks go out to Riitta Katila and Steven Klepper for sug - gesting this test . likely come out of academia , though university patents account for only a small proportion ( 4 . 8 % ) of the total number of patents citing science in our sample . Notably , the models fail to show that science produces knowledge of any greater gener - ality ; neither the number of classes nor subclasses has a signi ﬁ cant relationship with the use of sci - ence in the invention process . In Models 12 and 13 , we compared the factors that predict a citation to science to those that correlate to university own - ership ( Model 12 ) and citations to non - scienti ﬁ c references ( Model 13 ) . Though this analysis increases our con ﬁ dence that non - patent references to the scienti ﬁ c lit - erature capture a connection to science , it also reveals one difference that requires further inves - tigation : patents that cite science exhibit lower coupling . Our theory actually accommodates this fact . Because we measure coupling as a function of the history of recombination , the prior appli - cation of scienti ﬁ c knowledge in a technologi - cal domain should facilitate prior recombination , thereby lowering the observed coupling score . One might worry , however , that this correlation rep - resents some other type of selection rather than an unfortunate ( but necessary ) weakness in our measure of coupling . To test the possible in ﬂ u - ence of this selection on our models , we created a selection term from the logistic regression results ( Model 10 ) representing the probability that each patent would cite science given its characteris - tics . 23 We then interacted this selection parameter with the coupling score and its quadratic term to determine whether selection effects might account for our previous ﬁ ndings . The results—see Model 9—demonstrate that the effects of science remain robust even after explicitly accounting for potential selection issues . DISCUSSION The results provide strong evidence that the returns to science depend on the dif ﬁ culty of the inventive 23 The logic for this speci ﬁ cation follows that of a Heckman selection model . The application period —the number of years between the application and granting of the patent—allows us to identify the procedure . Although this factor positively relates to both university assignees and the likelihood of citing science , we have no reason to expect that it would in ﬂ uence the number of future patents that would cite the focal patent following the grant date and the lack of correlation ( r = 0 . 02 ) between application period and future cites supports this notion .

When inventors work with relatively independent components , science offers little or no advantage . On the other hand , science can allow inventors recombining highly coupled components to avoid the dif ﬁ culties inher - ent in local search on a rugged landscape . Though the size of this effect may appear modest , a 10 percent increase in citations at the mean level of coupling , it likely corresponds to a much larger economic bene ﬁ t . If the exponential relationship between citations and economic value found by Harhoff et al . ( 1999 ) for German patents holds in the U . S . market , this 10 percent increase in cita - tions would correspond to a 214 percent increase in economic value . 24 At one standard deviation above 24 Harhoff et al . ( 1999 ) ﬁ nd the following relationship for value : Dollars = 1000000 e (cid:2) lncites − 2 . 076 0 . 119 (cid:3) . the mean of coupling , the expected value of apply - ing science would increase the average value of a patent by 281 percent , at two standard deviations , 473 percent . Hence , the economic value of science may increase considerably with the dif ﬁ culty of the inventive problem . A more nuanced consideration of the results allows us to investigate which proposed mech - anisms likely play the most important roles in generating this effect . The results do not , how - ever , allow us to rule out any of the mechanisms through which science might in ﬂ uence the search process of invention . As one would expect if sci - ence either points inventors more directly to the most useful con ﬁ gurations of components or sim - ply allows them to avoid swaths of less productive solution space , science increases the average use - fulness of more tightly coupled inventions ( see Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 909 – 928 ( 2004 ) Science as a Map in Technological Search 925 Tables 4 and 6 ) . Moreover , the strong effects that science has on reducing the variance in inven - tive outcomes using coupled components suggests that science operates more by leading inventors directly to useful outcomes ( see Table 5 ) ; reducing the solution space would have a relatively weak effect on the unpredictability in outcomes because even the ‘best’ regions of rugged landscapes still have highly varied terrain . Inconsistent with this direct link , however , inventors calling on science appear to work in regions with more search activ - ity . Both Models 10 and 11 indicate that inven - tions that call on science work with components that have been recombined more frequently in the past , whereas a direct path to the best combina - tions should reduce the number of iterations . This ﬁ nding suggests that science also aids invention by providing researchers with motivation to continue searching in a particular direction despite negative feedback . These two mechanisms , one directing research - ers to the most useful regions of space , the other encouraging them in the face of failure , likely com - plement each other in the process of inventing with coupled components . Even in areas with well - developed science , inventors often do not have suf ﬁ cient knowledge to predict all of the interac - tions that might occur among a highly coupled set of components . Hence , even after embarking on the right path , they must typically engage in trial - and - error learning ( probably through local search ) to ﬁ ll in these missing pieces . Many qualitative accounts , such as Fleming’s ( 2002 ) history of ink - jet printing , point to just such an interaction . 25 Nucleation physics greatly enhanced the inven - tors’ understanding of the fundamental processes underlying the formation of ink bubbles , but they still went through hundreds of iterations between science and empirical search to ﬁ nd the right com - bination of materials to produce consistently high - quality printing . As in this case , science likely operates through multiple mechanisms in improv - ing inventive outcomes . Science may even in ﬂ uence the shape of techno - logical innovation along other dimensions beyond the process that inventors use in recombining com - ponents . For example , science might aid in the dis - covery of new components ( Smith and Hounshell , 1985 ) . Although the recombination of elements implies that the potential number of inventions 25 Rosenberg ( 1974 ) offers several additional examples . expands very rapidly with the number of funda - mental components ( Weitzman , 1996 ) , completely new components must obviously arise from some - where . Some exogenous process might govern these arrivals , but science may also stimulate tech - nological progress by identifying new fundamental components for recombination . Though outside the scope of our analysis , it seems interesting to note that of the 442 patents excluded from our analysis because they had no prior art , 46 percent reference a scienti ﬁ c journal article ( vs . 17 % in the sample as a whole ) . Regardless of the particular mechanisms , the differential returns to the application of science likely in ﬂ uence when inventors call on science and when they do not . Although the analysis of when non - patent science references appear on a patent suggests that these patents involve the recombi - nation of less coupled elements ( see Models 10 and 11 ) , this result likely arises as an artifact of the calculation of our coupling measure . We esti - mated coupling by observing the historical ease of recombining patent subclasses . If researchers have used science in the past to facilitate the use of this component , this practice would bias our coupling measure downward ( indeed , the stock of science in a particular subclass correlates nega - tively , r = − 0 . 28 , with its observed dif ﬁ culty of recombination ) . The effects of the selection terms in Model 9 corroborate this notion ; the types of patents on which science references appear exhibit larger marginal effects to coupling . Hence , inven - tors appear to use science most frequently in those domains that , because they work with highly cou - pled components , offer the greatest returns to its application . To some degree , then , variation in the application of science across industries likely stems from the types of inventive challenges par - ticipants in these sectors face . These results extend prior research on the link between science and innovation . Much of the existing work of the role of science in stimulat - ing technological advance investigates the research and patenting activities of universities , identifying such features as changes in federal law , 26 the 26 Prior to 1980 , the property rights to the results of research funded by government grants belonged to the federal govern - ment . Thus , university researchers funded by federal grants had little incentive to apply for patents . The Bayh - Dole Act , passed in 1980 , eliminated this provision and allowed researchers to retain the property rights to federally funded research . Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 909 – 928 ( 2004 ) 926 L . Fleming and O . Sorenson establishment of university of ﬁ ces for technol - ogy transfer , and increased industry funding of university research as factors in ﬂ uencing the pro - pensity of universities to patent ( Henderson et al . , 1998 ; Mowery and Shane , 2002 ) . Much of the application of science , however , occurs outside the university ; in our sample , only 4 . 5 percent of the patents referencing an article in the Scienti ﬁ c Index had university assignees . Though private ﬁ rms also face incentives to use science ( Cockburn et al . , 2000 ) , most prior research has failed to address the question of how these incentives might vary systematically according to the ﬁ rm’s technology . By focusing on precisely how science might aid inventors , this research identi ﬁ es one technologi - cal factor—the dif ﬁ culty of recombining coupled components—that appears to in ﬂ uence the poten - tial returns to the application of science . Our ﬁ ndings also inform research on complex systems—particularly research applying Kauff - man’s NK model to the social sciences . Kauff - man’s model predicts a non - monotonic relation - ship between coupling and the outcomes of local search . When actors do not use science—and pre - sumably therefore engage in local search—the results conform closely to Kauffman’s expecta - tions . Nevertheless , our results clearly show the inapplicability of this model to situations in which the searchers have some understanding or cogni - tive model of the landscape they search ; inven - tors following science do not behave like local searchers . Thus , researchers wishing to apply the NK model to cognitively aware agents should revisit the model and modify it to account for the search heuristics that people actually use ( cf . Gavetti and Levinthal , 2000 ; Rivkin , 2000 ) . For the individual inventor , the policy impli - cations seem straightforward . Science offers lim - ited bene ﬁ ts to inventors working with modu - lar components—given the cost of searching and digesting the scienti ﬁ c literature , the price tag for using science likely exceeds its bene ﬁ ts for those working with uncoupled components . In contrast , science offers large potential rewards to inventors operating with highly coupled compo - nents . Without science , inventors that search these landscapes must rely on exhaustive search tech - niques . Although inventors could focus resources on developing methods for testing large numbers of combinations cheaply , efforts along these lines have met with limited success ; for example , com - binatorial synthesis strategies remain problematic , as demonstrated by the recent controversy in drug discovery over the effectiveness of combinatorial chemistry and high - throughput screening ( Drews , 2000 ) . An understanding of the forces creating these interactions through the development of basic science offers an attractive means for accelerating invention in these highly coupled technologies . In conclusion , we wish to reiterate that this paper proposed and tested one explanation for why the returns to the application of scienti ﬁ c knowledge to invention might vary across technological ﬁ elds . In particular , by envisioning invention as a process of searching through combinations of technologi - cal components for new and useful con ﬁ gurations , we argue that science acts like a map—providing inventors with a sense of the underlying tech - nological landscape they search—thereby allow - ing them to avoid the dif ﬁ culties inherent in try - ing to combine highly coupled components . Our results demonstrate that scienti ﬁ c knowledge mit - igates the negative effect that coupling typically has on the outcomes of invention . In doing so , this research elaborates the more proximate role that science plays in technological advance and how it in ﬂ uences the rate and quality of invention . Thus , it brings a somewhat more nuanced view of the bene ﬁ ts of science in stimulating technologi - cal advance , and with it economic growth , to the already extensive literature on the subject .
