Abstract We show that Arf3p , a member of the ADP ribosylation family , is involved in the organization of actin cables and cortical patches in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Proﬁlin - deﬁcient cells ( pfy1 D ) have severe growth defects and lack actin cables . Overexpression of ARF3 restores actin cables and corrects growth defects in these cells . Cells deﬁcient for the cortical patch proteins Las17p and Vrp1p have growth defects and a random cortical patch distribution . Overexpression of ARF3 in las17 D and in vrp1 D cells partially corrects growth defects and restores the polarized distribution of cortical patches . The N - terminal glycine , a myristoylation site in Arf3p , is necessary for its suppressor activity . arf3 D cells show a random budding pattern . Overexpression of BNI1 , GEA2 or SYP1 , three genes involved in actin cytoskeleton formation , restores the normal axial budding pattern of arf3 D cells . BUD6 is a polarity gene and GEA2 is involved in retrograde transport and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . We have identiﬁed genetic interactions between ARF3 and BUD6 , and between ARF3 and GEA2 . Both double mutant strains have actin cytoskeleton defects . Our results support a role for ARF3 in cell polarity and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . Introduction The actin cytoskeleton is a complex structure found in some bacteria and in all eukaryotic cells ( Gitai , 2005 ) . The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two types of polymer - ized actin structures , cables and patches ( Kilmartin & Adams , 1984 ; Amberg , 1998 ; Yang & Pon , 2002 ) . These structures are usually oriented towards regions of cell growth . For example , in cells with small buds , the cables extend from the cell cortex and neck of the bud into the mother cell . Actin cables , which contain linear actin ﬁlaments , are involved in polarized secretion and organelle segregation ( Bretscher , 2003 ) . Cor - tical patches are seen as numerous punctuate structures in developing buds and in the mother cell at later stages of the cell cycle . These globular structures are mobile , turn over rapidly and contain actin ﬁlaments with 70 1 side branches ( Karpova et al . , 1998 ; Huckaba et al . , 2004 ; Young et al . , 2004 ) . Cortical patches function in the internalization step of endocytosis ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ; Duncan & Payne , 2005 ; Kim et al . , 2006 ) . Recent evidence has shown that two systems of polymer - ization , containing largely nonoverlapping sets of proteins , are used to form these two classes of actin ﬁlaments ( Pruyne & Bretscher , 2000b ; Goode & Rodal , 2001 ) . Actin cables are nucleated by the formin protein Bni1p and are decorated by tropomyosins , Tpm1p and Tpm2p ( Liu & Bretscher , 1989 ; Drees et al . , 1995 ; Sagot et al . , 2002a ) . Actin monomers ( Act1p ) , Bni1p , Bud6p , proﬁlin ( Pfy1p ) , Spa2p and signal - ing proteins are involved in the formation of actin cables . Evidence for the role of these proteins in cable formation has come from genetic studies , biochemical analysis and im - munoﬂuorescence microscopy . Brieﬂy , cells lacking func - tional proﬁlin or the formin proteins have cortical patches but few or no actin cables ( Marcoux et al . , 1998 , 2000 ; Evangelista et al . , 2002 ; Sagot et al . , 2002a ) . The overexpres - sion of a truncated BNI1 gene , coding for Bni1pFH1FH2 , in a wild - type strain causes the formation of supernumerary convoluted actin cables ( Pruyne et al . , 2002 ; Sagot et al . , 2002b ; Zakrzewska et al . , 2003 ) . Long actin ﬁlaments are polymerized in vitro in a reaction containing actin mono - mers , Bni1p , Bud6p and Pfy1p ( Pruyne et al . , 2002 ; Sagot et al . , 2002b ; Moseley et al . , 2004 ) . Finally , protein – protein interaction studies provide evidence for a large protein complex , the polarisome , containing the proteins Bni1p , Bud6 , Pea2p , Spa2p and Sph1p ( Fujiwara et al . , 1998 ; Sheu et al . , 1998 ; Shih et al . , 2005 ) .

All rights reserved Numerous proteins are involved in the polymerization of the branched actin ﬁlaments in cortical patches . The Arp2 / 3 complex , which contains seven proteins including the actin - related proteins Arp2p and Arp3p , is essential for nucleation ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ; Winter et al . , 1999 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro , however , has only weak nucleation activity . In budding yeast , Las17p and Abp1p are strong activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex while Pan1p , which is associated with the proteins Sla1p and End3p , is a weak activator . The class I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p and the yeast equivalent of the mammalian WASP - interacting protein , Vrp1p , also regulate the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , either negatively or positively ( Lechler et al . , 2000 ; Duncan et al . , 2001 ; Goode et al . , 2001 ; D’Agostino & Goode , 2005 ) . The small GTPase proteins with their regulatory GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) and guanosine exchange factor ( GEF ) are important regulators of the actin cytoskeleton . Budding yeast contain six Rho proteins : Cdc42p and Rho1p – Rho5p , which all have roles in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton ( Marcoux et al . , 2000 ; Pruyne & Bretscher , 2000a ; Lechler et al . , 2001 ; Dong et al . , 2003 ) . Cdc42p is an activator of Bni1p and it also recruits two activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex , Las17p and Vrp1p , to the complex . Rho1p activates Pkc1p , which in turn regulates the polarisome ( Fujiwara et al . , 1998 ) . Rho2p is a suppressor of the proﬁlin - deﬁcient phenotype ( Marcoux et al . , 2000 ) . Rho3p and Rho4p share an essential function in Bni1p activation and Rho5p negatively regulates stress - induced actin depolarization ( Schmitz et al . , 2002 ) . Little is known about the role of another class of small GTPase proteins in the actin cytoskeleton , the ADP ribosy - lation family , which contains three members , Arf1p , Arf2p and Arf3p ( Jackson & Casanova , 2000 ) . Arf1p and Arf2p are partially redundant in function and are important in retro - grade transport between the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum ( Stearns et al . , 1990 ; Roth , 1999 ; Springer et al . , 1999 ; Yahara et al . , 2001 ) . Arf3p is not implicated in Golgi – endoplasmic reticulum transport ( Lee et al . , 1994 ; Huang et al . , 2003 ) . In the present work , we show that Arf3p plays a role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton .

Transformations of the cells were performed by a modiﬁed lithium acetate procedure ( Kaiser et al . , 1994 ) . Plasmid constructions The plasmid pRMP100 was constructed as follows . The ARF3 coding sequence was ampliﬁed by PCR from the wild - type ( WT ) strain BY4741 using the oligonucleotides ARF3 BamHI ( BamHI Site is in bold characters ) forward : 5 0 CG GGATCC GGTCTCATAACCCT TTCTTG and ARF3 EcoRI ( EcoRI Site is in bold characters ) reverse : 5 0 CG GAATTC GGTGTA TGCAGATTCAACACC . The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pBluescript plasmid . The ARF3 gene was excised from this plasmid with SacI and KpnI and was cloned into the SacI and KpnI sites of the multicopy pRS426 plasmid . The plasmid p4753 was used to overexpress the Bni1p domains FH1 and FH2 ( Bni1pFH1FH2 ) in the arf3 D strain . The plasmids p88 and pGMS3 were used to overexpress the GEA1 and GEA2 genes respectively in arf3 D . To construct the plasmid pEML102 , containing the SYP1 coding sequence , the SYP1 gene was excised from pBS - SYP1 ( Marcoux et al . , 2000 ) with SacI and KpnI and was cloned into the SacI and KpnI sites of the multicopy plasmid pRS426 . The plasmid was cloned into arf3 D cells . Cells were observed and photographed with a Leica ﬂuorescence mi - croscope . Images were captured by a CoolSNAP - Prool Monochrome camera using the IpEx32 program . Images were processed by Adobe Photoshop to enhance only brightness and contrast . Site - directed mutagenesis The ARF3 gene in pBluescript was used for site - directed mutagenesis . Two speciﬁc mutations were made in ARF3 . The ﬁrst was introduced into the second amino acid where a glycine was replaced by an alanine ( G2A ) . The other muta - tion was in the third amino acid where an asparagine was substituted for an alanine ( N3A ) . These mutations were made with the QuikChange TM Site - Directed Mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) . The mutagenic oligonucleotide primers are listed below and the mismatched bases are underlined : ARF3 G2A forward : 5 0 GCTAATTGTAGAGATGGCCAA TTCAATTTCGAAGG ARF3 G2A reverse : 5 0 CCTTCGAAATTGAATTGGCCATC TCTACAATTAGC ARF3 N3A forward : 5 0 GCTAATTGTAGAGATGGGCGCT TCAATTTCGAAGGTTCTG ARF3 N3A reverse : 5 0 CAGAACCTTCGAAATTGAAGCG CCCATCTCTACAATTAGC The mutagenized genes with their promoters were cloned into the SacI / KpnI sites of the multicopy plasmid pRS426 . Phalloidin staining Staining of actin ﬁlaments was carried out according to a modiﬁed protocol for visualizing actin ﬁlaments ( Zakrzews - ka et al . , 2003 ) . Cells were grown to exponential phase at 30 or 37 1 C . All of the cells were ﬁxed at room temperature for 30 min by addition of 37 % formaldehyde to 3 . 7 % ﬁnal concentration directly into the culture media . The cells were washed in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and stained with 0 . 3 m M AlexaFluor 488 - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark . Cells were observed and photographed as previously described . Calcofluor white staining Staining of chitin with Calcoﬂuor White was performed as described by Pringle ( 1991 ) . Cells were observed and photographed . A minimum of 200 cells were counted to determine the budding pattern . Construction of double mutant strains The arf3 D gea2 D strain was obtained by sporulation of the heterozygous diploid strain arf3 D < kan / gea2 D < HIS3 ( CJY049 - 11 - 4 ) . The tetrads were dissected manually using a dissection microscope to isolate the arf3 D gea2 D double mutant haploid strain . Table 2 .

Results Overexpression of ARF3 restores actin cables in pfy1 D cells Cells lacking proﬁlin ( pfy1 D ) have severe defects in actin cytoskeleton organization and growth . These cells are large and round , grow slowly at 30 1 C and do not grow at 37 1 C or in the presence of 1 . 25 mg mL (cid:2) 1 caffeine ( Marcoux et al . , 2000 ) . Actin cables are absent and the numerous cortical patches are randomly distributed in the bud and in the mother cell . During a genetic screen for suppressors of the proﬁlin - deﬁcient phenotype , we showed that overexpres - sion of ARF3 in the YEp24 vector partially corrects the aberrant phenotype of pfy1 D cells . The cells were normal in size , had cortical patches polarized in buds , but did not have visible actin cables ( Zakrzewska et al . , 2003 ) . We re - examined the correction of pfy1 D cells by the ARF3 gene by cloning this gene into the smaller multicopy plasmid , pRS426 . With this new construction , the pfy1 D strain has a WT phenotype . The size of these cells is normal and all the cortical patches are polarized in the bud . The budding pattern is also corrected from a random distribu - tion to an axial pattern ( results not shown ) and growth is restored at 37 1 C and in the presence of 1 . 25 mg mL (cid:2) 1 caffeine at 30 1 C ( Fig . 1a ) . The most interesting observation is the presence of perfectly formed actin cables ( Fig . 1b ) . These results show that overexpression of ARF3 restores formation of actin cables in a proﬁlin - deﬁcient cell . A similar result was obtained with the overexpression of the genes GEA1 and GEA2 , which are GEFs for Arf proteins ( Zakrzewska et al . , 2003 ) . Overexpression of ARF3 corrects the cortical patch defects in las17 D and vrp1 D cells Las17p and Vrp1p are two important proteins in the cortical patch formation pathway . Las17p , which is the yeast equiva - lent of human WASP protein , is the principal activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Lechler & Li , 1997 ; Li , 1997 ; Madania et al . , 1999 ) . In las17 D cells , actin cables are normal but few cortical patches are present ( Fig . 2a ) . In las17 D cells over - expressing ARF3 , the overall morphology of the actin cytoskeleton is normal and is similar to the actin cytoskele - ton in WT cells ( Fig . 1b ) . Notably , in the overexpressing cells numerous cortical patches are seen . In cells with small buds , the cortical patches are polarized and are primarily located in the bud ( Fig . 2a ) . ARF3 , however , is only a partial suppressor of the las17 D phenotype . las17 D cells overexpres - sing ARF3 are larger than WT cells , they do not grow in liquid culture at 37 1 C and they grow slowly at 30 1 C . Vrp1p , a proline - rich protein , is the yeast homologue of the human WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) . It binds actin monomers and also binds to the WH1 domain of Las17p ( Vaduva et al . , 1997 ; Evangelista et al . , 2000 ) . vrp1 D cells are larger than normal , grow more slowly than WT cells at 30 and 37 1 C and are sensitive to 1 . 25 mg mL (cid:2) 1 caffeine ( Don - nelly et al . , 1993 ) . In most vrp1 D cells , the cortical patches are distributed randomly in mother and daughter cells throughout the cell cycle . Importantly , no actin patches are seen in newly emerging buds , while actin cables appear normal ( Fig . 2b ) . Overexpression of ARF3 in vrp1 D cells partially restores the WT phenotype . The cells are near normal in size and have a normal distribution of cortical patches through the cell cycle at 30 and 37 1 C . Actin cables are clearly visible in the mother cell . The cells with small buds contain numerous cortical patches throughout the bud ( Fig . 2b ) . The cells have a near normal growth rate on plates at 30 and 37 1 C and have normal growth in the presence of 1 . 25 mg mL (cid:2) 1 caffeine ( Fig . 2c ) . ARF3 , however , is only a partial suppressor of the vrp1 D phenotype . vrp1 D cells overexpressing ARF3 grow more slowly than WT cells in liquid culture at 37 1 C ( results not shown ) . These results show that the overexpression of ARF3 corrects cortical patch defects in las17 D and vrp1 D cells . Combined with the results on the formation of actin cables in pfy1 D cells , these results demonstrate that the overexpres - sion of ARF3 in certain mutant cells can activate the path - ways to actin cable and cortical patch formation . It should be noted that the cortical patch defects are not suppressed in las17 D and vrp1 D cellsby the overexpression of GEA2 , a gene that induces actin cable formation in pfy1 D cells ( results not shown ) . The N - terminal glycine , a myristoylation site in Arf3p , is necessary for its suppressor activity Rho - type GTPases have lipid modiﬁcations that are neces - sary for membrane anchoring . The glycine in the second position of the Arf3p sequence is N - myristolyated ( Huang et al . , 2003 ) . To determine whether this modiﬁcation is FEMS Yeast Res 7 ( 2007 ) 782 – 795 c (cid:1) 2007 Federation of EuropeanMicrobiological Societies Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd . All rights reserved 785 Arf3p in actin cable and patch formation essential for the suppressor activity of Arf3p , site - directed mutagenesis was used to modify the binding site for myristoylation by exchanging a glycine for an alanine ( G2A ) . As a control experiment , the third amino acid , an asparagine , was modiﬁed to an alanine ( N3A ) . These two Arf3p mutations were expressed in pfy1 - 111 arf3 D cells . This strain was chosen as it does not contain a WT ARF3 gene and it has a defective actin organization at 37 1 C . We could not use the double mutant cells pfy1 D arf3 D for this experiment because the cells are inviable . At 37 1 C , the pfy1 - 111 arf3 D cells have few actin cables , are larger than normal and have randomly distributed cortical patches ( Fig . 3 ) . The actin cytoskeleton and morphological abnormalities in this strain are suppressed by the overexpression of WT ARF3 or by ARF3N3A ( data not shown ) . The cortical patches are polarized and numerous actin cables are visible . By contrast , overexpression of ARF3G2A does not suppress the phenotype of this strain ; the cells are large with few cables and with a random distribution of cortical patches ( Fig . 3 ) . In addition , the overexpression of ARF3G2A does not correct the actin cytoskeleton defects or the growth defects in vrp1 D cells ( results not shown ) . These results show the importance of the glycine myristoylation site for the activity of the Arf3p protein . Arf3p requires functional formin proteins Bni1p and Bnr1p for actin cable formation Budding yeast have two formin proteins , Bni1p and Bnr1p , that are necessary for actin cable formation . Neither Bni1p nor Bnr1p is essential for growth but cells lacking both proteins are nonviable . The double mutant bni1 - FH2 # 1 bnr1 D carrying a temperature - sensitive allele for BNI1 and a deleted BNR1 gene is viable with normal actin Fig . 1 .

Lambert et al . the double mutant bni1 - FH2 # 1 bnr1 D cell was transformed with ARF3 and the actin cytoskeleton was observed . Over - expression of ARF3 in these cells has no effect on the actin cytoskeleton : the cortical patches are still depolarized and no actin cables are visible ( Fig . 4 ) . These results show that Arf3p cannot replace the formin proteins for the production of actin cables . Overexpression of GEA2 , SYP1 or a fragment coding for BnipFH1FH2 corrects the budding defect of arf3 D cells The budding pattern is axial in WT haploid cells , with the new bud emerging near the previous division site . arf3 D cells have an abnormal budding pattern ( Fig . 5 ) . In these cells , bud formation is not axial but is distributed randomly over the cell surface . The phenomenon , however , is not seen in all cells . About 40 % of arf3 D mutant cells show random budding at 30 1 C . This proportion increases to 90 % at 37 1 C . The overexpression of ARF3 , BNI1 , GEA2 or SYP1 can restore a normal cytoskeleton in pfy1 D cells ( Marcoux et al . , 2000 ; Zakrzewska et al . , 2003 ) . We therefore determined whether the overexpression of BNI1 , GEA2 or SYP1 can correct the budding defects of arf3 D cells . As the over - expression of an intact BNI1 gene is lethal , we used a truncated BNI1 gene containing the FHI / FH2 domains ( Bni1pFH1FH2 ) or intact GEA2 and SYP1 genes . We also tested the effect of the overexpression of the genes GEA1 , MID2 , RHO2 , ROM2 and WSC1 , which were previously identiﬁed as suppressors of the proﬁlin - deﬁcient phenotype ( Marcoux et al . , 1998 , 2000 ; Zakrzewska et al . , 2003 ) . Only the overexpression of the truncated BNI1 , SYP1 or GEA2 genes corrects the random budding of arf3 D cells . At 30 1 C , only about 5 % of the overexpressing cells show a random budding pattern compared with 40 % of the arf3 D cells . The vast majority of the cells overexpressing any of the three genes have the WT axial budding pattern ( Fig . 5 ) . These results indicate a genetic interaction between Arf3p and the proteins Bni1p , Gea2p and Syp1p . They also demonstrate that these three proteins can function in the absence of Arf3p . Interestingly , the overexpression of GEA1 has no effect on the random budding pattern of the arf3 D strain ( Fig . 5 ) . Although Gea1p and Gea2p have partially overlapping functions in Golgi to endoplasmic transport , they are not equivalent in the suppression of the budding defect of the arf3 D strain . ARF3 shows genetic interactions with BUD6 and GEA2 No genetic lethal interactions are known for the combina - tion of the ARF3 deletion and a second deletion . To test for possible genetic interactions that affect the organization of the actin cytoskeleton , we constructed ﬁve double mutant strains carrying the ARF3 deletion and another deletion . These genes were chosen on the basis of their coding for proteins involved in actin cable formation ( BNI1 , BUD6 , GEA1 , GEA2 ) , and in possible protein – protein interactions with Arf3p ( LSB5 ) ( Sagot et al . , 2002a ; Evangelista et al . , 2003 ; Zakrzewska et al . , 2003 ; Costa et al . , 2005 ; Moseley & Goode , 2005 ) . We observed the actin cytoskeleton in strains carrying a single and a double deletion at 30 and 37 1 C . The actin cytoskeleton and morphology are normal in all the single deletion strains at both temperatures , except for arf3 D and bud6 D strains ( Fig . 6 ) . arf3 D cells at 30 1 C have a WT morphology and normal organization of the actin cytoskeleton . At 37 1 C , c . 20 % of the cells have two buds but the actin cytoskeleton is normal in all cells with one bud ( Fig . 6a ) . bud6 D cells have a normal patch distribution at 30 1 C , but the actin cables are thin and more difﬁcult to detect than in a WT strain . At 37 1 C , this strain shows a slight depolarization of actin patches but most of the patches are found in the bud in cells with small buds ( Fig . 6b ) . Genetic interactions are only seen between ARF3 , BUD6 and GEA2 . The actin cytoskeleton is modiﬁed in arf3 D - bud6 D cells . At 30 1 C , the cortical patches are partially depolarized . In some cells , no patches are seen at the tip of the bud and in all cells , numerous cortical patches are found in the mother cell . The actin cables are thinner and less numerous than those seen in arf3 D or in bud6 D cells ( Fig . 6c ) . The presence of two buds in 50 % of the arf3 D bud6 D cells growing at 37 1 C is a distinguishing feature . In these double budded cells , cables were faint and the cortical patches were depolarized ( results not shown ) . The double mutant arf3 D bud6 D strain grows more slowly than WT and single mutant cells at 25 , 30 and 37 1 C and on 1 . 25 mg mL (cid:2) 1 caffeine . The results for growth on caffeine at 30 1 C are shown ( Fig . 6f ) . These results are a clear indication of a genetic interaction between ARF3 and BUD6 . A genetic interaction is also detected between ARF3 and GEA2 . At 30 1 C , the double mutant arf3 D gea2 D cells are somewhat larger and rounder than WT cells . The cortical patches are partially disorganized in these mutant cells , with the presence of cortical patches in the mother cell in all cell cycle stages . Actin cables are present , often forming highly convoluted structures not aligned along the bud mother cell axis . At 37 1 C , these double mutant cells are even larger ( Fig . 6e ) . Cortical patches show a random distribution in all cells . The actin cables are either not visible or are seen as short disorganized fragments . These results demonstrate genetic interactions between ARF3 and BUD6 and between ARF3 and GEA2 . Interestingly , the double mutant cells arf3 D - gea1 D have a WT appearance at 30 and 37 1 C and a normal distribution of actin cables and patches ( results not shown ) . No genetic interaction is therefore observed between ARF3 and GEA1 .

Arf1p and Arf2p are 96 % identical and have overlapping functions . A deletion of either gene is viable , but the deletion of both genes is lethal . The activated GTP - associated forms of both proteins bind to membranes and are involved in retrograde transport from Fig . 5 . Correction of the abnormal bud pattern in arf3 D by overexpression of the truncated BNI1 , coding for Bni1p ( FH1FH2 ) , GEA1 , GEA2 and SYP1 . WTcells , mutant cells ( arf3 D ) and mutant cells overexpressing the truncated BNI1 in plasmid p4753 , GEA1 in plasmid p88 , GEA2 in plasmid pGMS3 or SYP1 in plasmid pEML102 were grown at 30 1 C , ﬁxed and stained with Calcoﬂuor White to visualize bud scars . In each experiment , a minimum of 200 cells with two bud scars or more were counted and analyzed . Mutant cells ( arf3 D ) exhibit abnormal bud pattern in about 40 % of cells . Overexpression of the truncated BNI1 , GEA2 or SYP1 in mutant cells ( arf3 D ) restores the normal axial budding pattern .

Arf3p is only 54 % identical to Arf1p and Arf2p . The arf3 D strain is viable as are the arf3 D arf1 D and arf3 D arf2 D double mutant strains . Arf3p is not involved in vesicular transport ( Lee et al . , 1994 ) . The protein is partially localized to the heavy membrane fraction by biochemical analysis and to the cell periphery and buds by green ﬂuorescent protein immunoﬂuorescence ( Huang et al . , 2003 ) . The polarized location of Arf3p is independent of the actin cytoskeleton but is dependent on an N - terminal myristoylation ( Huang et al . , 2003 ) . The myristoylation is also necessary for the actin cytoskeleton activity of Arf3p ( this work ) . arf3 D cells have a random budding pattern but have a normal actin cytoskeleton and normal ﬂuid - phase endocytosis as mea - sured by the uptake of ﬂuorescent dyes . Arf3p has been recently shown to interact physically with Lsb5p ( Costa et al . , 2005 ) . Lsb5p locates to the cortical membrane region by an actin - independent but Arf3p - dependent mechanism . Lsb5p also interacts with Sla1p and Las17p , two cortical patch proteins important for endocytosis . The deletion of LSB5 in a strain lacking the actin - associated protein gene YSC84 leads to a severe phenotype of a disorganized actin cytoskeleton and the almost complete loss of ﬂuid - phase endocytosis ( Dewar et al . , 2002 ) . Here we show that Arf3p is involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . Six independent lines of evidence support this conclusion . First , the overexpression of ARF3 in a pRS426 vector restores visible cables in a proﬁlin - deﬁcient mutant , pfy1 D . The resulting cells resemble WT cells in all aspects . Second , Las17p is an important activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex , a necessary element for cortical patch formation . Mutant las17 D cells have clearly visible actin cables but contain few or no cortical patches . The over - expression of ARF3 in these cells leads to a normal amount and distribution of cortical patches . Third , vrp1 D cells have few cortical patches in developing buds and have a general delocalization of cortical patches in other cell cycle stages . The overexpression of ARF3 in these cells restores the WT distribution of cortical patches . Fourth , the formin protein Bni1p is a key element in the formation of actin ﬁlaments . The overexpression of BNI1 corrects the random budding defects of arf3 D cells . Fifth , the GEF protein Gea2p restores actin cables in pfy1 D cells , indicating that it is involved in actin cable formation . The overexpression of GEA2 restores the normal budding pattern to arf3 D cells , and ARF3 and GEA2 show a genetic interaction . The double mutant arf3 D gea2 D has few actin cables and has a random distribution of cortical patches . Finally , Bud6p is involved in actin cable formation . This protein binds actin monomers and also binds to the formin protein Bni1p in the polarisome ( Moseley & Goode , 2005 ) . The arf3 D and the bud6 D mutants individually have either a normal or near normal actin cytoskeleton organization . The arf3 D bud6 D double mutant has a severely compromised actin cytoskeleton . Cells have either only a few short or no visible actin cables . The cortical patches in most cells are delocalized . The double mutant cells also show growth defects . The Arf GTPase family of proteins requires the action of guanosine nucleotide exchange factors for their activity . The yeast proteins Gea1p , Gea2p , Sec7p and Syt1p were identi - ﬁed as exchange factors for Arf1p . The proteins Gea1p and Gea2p , which are found in a membrane - bound and soluble form , are involved in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum . These two proteins are also involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . The overexpression of GEA1 or GEA2 in pfy1 D cells restores the polarized distribution of cortical patches and produces visible actin cables ( Zakrzewska et al . , 2003 ) . Several lines of evidence indicate that these two genes are not completely redundant for their activity in vesicular transport and actin cytoskeleton organization . Gea1p and Gea2p have only partially overlapping cellular locations . Gea1p localizes to a large number of small foci distributed throughout the cell while Gea2p is localized to bright foci within the cytoplasm , consistent with Golgi or endosomal components . The arf1 D gea1 D double mutant is viable while the arf1 D gea2 D double mutant is nonviable ( Spang et al . , 2001 ) . In the present work we show that the arf3 D gea1 D strain has a normal actin cytoskeleton while the arf3 D gea2 D strain has fewer actin cables and depolarized cortical patches . In addition , the overexpression of GEA2 but not GEA1 corrects the random budding defect of the arf3 D strain . The genetic interaction between ARF3 and GEA2 suggests that Arf3p and Gea2p functionally interact in yeast cells . The identity of the GEF protein for Arf3p is not known . It could be Gea1p , Gea2p , another GEF or some combination of these proteins . Our immunoﬂuorence studies show that the proper location of Arf3p is independent of the presence of Gea1p and Gea2p ( results not shown ) . Our genetic interactions suggest , however , that Gea2p is not the unique GEF for Arf3p . The arf3 D gea2 D strain has a severely depolarized actin cytoskeleton while each of the single mutations has a normal cytoskeleton , demonstrating that the effects of the arf3 D and gea2 D mutations are additive . In addition , the overexpression of GEA2 corrects the ran - dom budding defect of the arf3 D strain , showing that excess Gea2p can bypass the requirement for Arf3p . These results suggest that if Gea2p is an activator of Arf3p , it must also have other protein targets . On the other hand , no genetic interaction was observed between ARF3 and GEA1 , and the overexpression of GEA1 does not suppress the random budding of the arf3 D strain . These results are compatible with a possible role for Gea1p as a GEF for Arf3p , but further experiments are necessary to verify this possibility .

Syp1p was identiﬁed as a multicopy suppressor of the actin cytoskeleton defects in pfy1 D cells . This protein is found in regions of active growth throughout the cell cycle : the presumptive bud site , growing buds and the septum in dividing cells ( Marcoux et al . , 2000 ) . The exact role for this protein is not known . In the present work , we identiﬁed SYP1 as a multicopy suppressor of the budding defects of the arf3 D strain . This shows that Syp1p can function in the absence of Arf3p and is further evidence that Syp1p is involved in cell polarity . The polarisome is a large protein complex involved in the formation of actin cables . It contains the proteins Bni1p , Bud6 , Pea2p , Spa2p and Sph1p . The proteins Pfy1p , Gea1p and Gea2p are also involved in cable formation . Although none of the proteins is a known binding partner for Arf3p , we have identiﬁed genetic interactions between ARF3 and BUD6 and ARF3 and PFY1 ( Zakrzewska et al . , 2003 ; this work ) . Finally , the overexpression of ARF3 is able to bypass the cell’s need for Pfy1p , Las17p and Vrp1p . Arf3p , a Rho - type GTPase , is one of the few budding yeast proteins implicated in actin cables and actin cortical patch forma - tion . This suggests that Arf3p has protein targets in both pathways . Acknowledgements We thank Manon Valcourt for technical help .
