In particular , 1 ) the structure of actin was resolved from crystals in the absence of cocrystallized actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) , 2 ) the prokaryotic ancestral gene of actin was crystallized and its function as a bacterial cytoskeleton was revealed , and 3 ) the structure of the Arp2 / 3 complex was described for the ﬁrst time . In this review we selected several ABPs ( ADF / coﬁlin , proﬁlin , gelsolin , thymosin (cid:1) 4 , DNase I , CapZ , tropomodulin , and Arp2 / 3 ) that regulate actin - driven assembly , i . e . , movement that is independent of motor proteins . They were chosen because 1 ) they represent a family of related proteins , 2 ) they are widely distributed in nature , 3 ) an atomic structure ( or at least a plausible model ) is available for each of them , and 4 ) each is expressed in signiﬁcant quantities in cells . These ABPs perform the following cellular functions : 1 ) they maintain the population of unassembled but assembly - ready actin monomers ( proﬁlin ) , 2 ) they regulate the state of polymerization of ﬁlaments ( ADF / coﬁlin , proﬁlin ) , 3 ) they bind to and block the growing ends of actin ﬁlaments ( gelsolin ) , 4 ) they nucleate actin assembly ( gelsolin , Arp2 / 3 , coﬁlin ) , 5 ) they sever actin ﬁlaments ( gelsolin , ADF / coﬁlin ) , 6 ) they bind to the sides of actin ﬁlaments ( gelsolin , Arp2 / 3 ) , and 7 ) they cross - link actin ﬁlaments ( Arp2 / 3 ) . Some of these ABPs are essential , whereas others may form regulatory ternary complexes . Some play crucial roles in human disorders , and for all of them , there are good reasons why investigations into their structures and functions should continue . I . INTRODUCTION A . The Cytoskeleton The internal cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells is com - posed of actin microﬁlaments , microtubules , and interme - diate ﬁlaments . The cytoskeleton is dynamic and strong , ever ready to adapt to demands on the cell . An important property of actin is its ability to produce movement in the absence of motor proteins . At the cell membrane micro - ﬁlament assembly protrudes the membrane forward pro - ducing the rufﬂing membranes in actively moving cells . Microﬁlaments can also play a passive structural role by providing the internal stiffening rods in microvilli , main - taining cell shape , and anchoring cytoskeletal proteins . The major focus of this review is to examine how actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) control these processes . Finally , we raise some interesting and challenging questions for future research . B . What Do We Exclude From This Review ? Actin microﬁlaments provide the “rails” along which myosin “motors” perform work in a variety of cellular functions . A major review of myosin motors ( 263 ) has been published , and they are excluded from this review . Microﬁlaments cooperate with microtubules via microtu - bule - associated proteins ( MAPs ) during the transport of vesicles and organelles , and this interesting aspect of microﬁlament function was recently reviewed ( 34 ) . Actin ﬁlaments also interact with intermediate ﬁlaments , a func - tion that may play an important role in enabling extracel - lular stimuli to be transmitted to key targets like ribo - somes and chromosomes deep within the cell . This ﬁeld is an emerging one . It will be covered by Quinlan et al . ( 235 ) and is beyond the scope of this review . II . STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF MONOMERIC ACTIN Actin is only found in eukaryotes . It comprises a highly conserved family of proteins that fall into three broad classes : (cid:2) - , (cid:1) - , and (cid:3) - isoforms . It is mainly located in the cytoplasm , but it is also present in the nucleus where it may or may not have motor - associated functions . The highest concentrations ( (cid:1) 20 % of the total protein ) of actin are in striated muscles ; however , signiﬁcant quanti - ties of actin are present in nonmuscle cells where it plays a variety of roles including myosin - independent changes of cells shape , motor - based organelle transport , regula - tion of ion transport , and receptor - mediated responses of the cell to external signals . A . The First Actin Crystals Few people in the ﬁeld of actin remember that Chris - tine Oriol - Audit was the ﬁrst to report the crystallization of actin in the absence of an actin - binding protein ( 212 ) . 1 These crystals were achieved in the presence of polyeth - ylene glycol but were too small to be useful for X - ray diffraction at that time . If today’s high - powered X - ray beam facilities were available then , they may well have yielded the atomic structure of actin in the absence of an ABP . Perhaps it was a cruel twist of fate that she sadly died early in 2001 without knowing that the ﬁrst structure of uncomplexed actin was soon to be published ( 216 ) . The principal obstacle to crystallizing actin was its pro - pensity to spontaneously self - assemble under solvent conditions conventionally used to grow protein crystals . B . Actin Microcrystals and Tubes In their pioneering book on the biophysics of protein polymerization , Fumio Oosawa and Sho Asakura ( 210 ) 1 Christine Oriol - Audit died in January 2001 . 434 DOS REMEDIOS ET AL .

We subsequently showed that these structures could be formed in the presence of the trivalent lanthanide ions , particularly Gd 3 (cid:2) ( 3 , 87 ) . These lanthanide - induced actin tubes ( composed of a single layer of monomers ) and microcrystals ( bilayered sheets ) provided the ﬁrst views of the shape of the actin monomer ( 3 , 73 ) . The computed average image of the monomer was “pear” shaped , having a “large” and a “small” domain . Electron diffraction studies revealed structure out to at least 14 . 5 - Å resolution , but this was simply not good enough to provide reliable molecular details ( 74 ) . In solution , actin ﬁlaments can form su - pramolecular assemblies called paracrystals ( 99 ) as well as forming liquid crystalline arrays ( 67 ) . C . Actin Monomer Structure Although the cocrystallization of actin with bovine pancreatic DNase I was ﬁrst reported in the late 1970s ( 176 ) , 13 years passed before the ﬁrst atomic resolution ( 2 . 4 Å ) structure of actin was reported ( 137 ) . The actin monomers used in these crystals were lightly digested with trypsin to remove the COOH - terminal three residues before crystallization . Because the crystal structure of DNase I had already been determined at 2 . 5 - Å resolution ( 272 ) , it was a relatively simple task to subtract its struc - ture from the actin - DNase I complex to obtain a clear view of the actin monomer . The resulting structure ( illus - trated in ribbon form in Fig . 1 A ) produced a number of surprises . For example , the large and small domains de - scribed at low resolution contained nearly equal numbers of residues and were nearly equal in size . Both the NH 2 and COOH termini were located in the same subdomain . DNase I makes crystal contacts across the “top” of the nucleotide cleft , thus explaining how it inhibits nucleotide exchange . However , since these were cocrystals , did this structure represent a monomer conformation when it was not complexed to DNase I ? Monomeric ( G - ) actin has dimensions of (cid:1) 67 (cid:3) 40 (cid:3) 37 Å and a molecular mass of nearly 43 , 000 Da . The overall features of the structure include four quasi - subdo - mains ( here they are numbered 1 – 4 but an alternative nomenclature of IA , IB , IIA , and IIB has an historical basis , Ref . 266 ) , each having a repeating motif comprising a multi - stranded (cid:1) - sheet , a (cid:1) - meander , and a right - handed (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1) - unit . About 40 % of the structure is (cid:2) - helical . In Figure 1 A , the monomer is oriented so that the top has about the same orientation it would have in the ﬁlament with its “pointed” end directed at the top of the page and the “barbed” end toward the bottom . A tightly bound nucleotide lies in a deep cleft in the center of G - actin . This site is usually occupied by ATP or ADP - P i rather than ADP , which binds with (cid:1) 10 - fold lower afﬁnity to Mg - G - actin and (cid:1) 200 - fold weaker binding with Ca - G - actin ( 147 ) . ATP binds as a complex with either Mg 2 (cid:2) [ dissociation constant ( K d ) 1 . 2 nM ] or Ca 2 (cid:2) ( K d 0 . 12 nM ) ( 79 , 270 ) . Mg 2 (cid:2) , the dominant cation in vivo , deter - mines how tightly or weakly the nucleotide binds . Six or seven relatively low - afﬁnity divalent cation - binding sites have been identiﬁed that appear to be important for actin paracrystal ( 94 , 271 ) , and actin microcrystal formation ( 73 ) , but their physiological importance is not well under - stood . A notable feature of the structure is a two - stranded “hinge” at residues 140 and 338 joining the large and small domains . Tirion et al . ( 283 ) describe a “propeller” motion between the two domains that produces an opening and closing of the nucleotide cleft . This putative slewing mo - FIG . 1 .

ACTIN AND ACTIN BINDING PROTEINS 435 Physiol Rev • VOL 83 • APRIL 2003 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on O c t obe r 26 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m tion is permitted because of this hinge and is viewed as a rigid body movement between the subdomains . There are several other atomic structures of actin . In 1993 , McLaughlin’s group at the Medical Research Coun - cil ( MRC ) in Cambridge ( 186 ) reported the structure of actin complexed with gelsolin segment 1 . This segment binds to the bottom of the monomer , making contacts with subdomains 1 and 3 ( see discussion below ) . Unlike the DNase I - actin structure , the COOH - terminal three res - idues were not cleaved before crystallization . However , the DNase I binding loop was not well resolved , presum - ably because it was not sufﬁciently stabilized in the ab - sence of DNase I . In the same year Schutt et al . ( 259 ) reported the structure of spleen actin ( a (cid:1) - isoform ) com - plexed to proﬁlin at a resolution of 2 . 55 ÅA . This group had been reﬁning their structure for many years and demonstrated that , although there was broad similarity to the structure of McLaughlin et al . ( 186 ) , there were sig - niﬁcant differences that they attributed to the sequence differences between the actin isoforms . The Schutt / Lindberg consortium that captured actin in a different conformation subsequently reported a fourth actin - proﬁlin structure . They again used bovine (cid:1) - actin cocrystallized with bovine pancreatic proﬁlin ( 60 ) . They named the two structures the open and closed states and used them to argue that the transition between the two states represented a structural change that could convert their “ribbon” polymer into conventional F - actin . In 2001 , the inevitable happened . Dominguez et al . at the Boston Biomedical Research Institute succeeded in producing small , high - quality crystals of actin that were not complexed to ABPs ( Fig . 1 B ) . This ﬁnding was re - ported at the Boston meeting of the Biophysical Society colleagues ( 216 ) and was subsequently published in Sci - ence ( 217 ) . They achieved the result that had eluded so many others by modifying the COOH - terminal cysteinyl ( Cys - 374 ) with a rhodamine label that suppressed the tendency of actin to polymerize . Dominguez and colleagues ( 217 ) were also the ﬁrst to crystallize actin with ADP present in the nucleotide - bind - ing cleft . This was important because we know that the critical concentration of ADP - G - actin is about an order of magnitude higher than for ATP or ADP - P i - G - actin ( 241 ) . Kabsch et al . ( 137 ) had also produced crystals of ADP - G - actin and showed that the ADP structure was not remark - ably different from the ATP form . However , the Kabsch crystals were formed in the presence of ATP , and the nucleotide was cleaved to ADP subsequent to crystalliza - tion . The structure of Dominguez et al . signiﬁcantly differs from the structure of Kabsch et al . , particularly in subdo - main 2 where DNase I binds . However , it could be argued that this Boston / Heidelberg difference is because ADP was present before the crystals were formed , i . e . , before the crystal contact points were established . A signiﬁcant structural difference actin crystallized alone and complexed with an ABP protein is relatively large coil - to - (cid:2) - helix conversion and a 10° rotation at the top of subdomain 2 . Although it is not clear if these differences represent native cellular G - actin , Dominguez et al . are currently completing the analysis of an uncom - plexed ATP - G - actin structure that should satisfy their critics . The substantial conformational change reported by Otterbein et al . ( 217 ) is well supported by other laborato - ries including our own . Dedova et al . ( 81 ) recently dem - onstrated , using ﬂuorescence spectroscopy , that signiﬁ - cant ( 1 – 4 Å ) changes occur in subdomains 1 and 2 when coﬁlin and DNase I bind either separately or as a ternary complex . Several other authors have suggested that actin can undergo allosteric conformational changes , and this is discussed in more detail in section IV . The major chal - lenge for structural biologists now lies in relating the structural changes to functional changes . D . MreB , an Ancestral Actin Actin is an essential and ubiquitous cytoskeletal com - ponent of all eukaryotic cells and is absent from prokary - otic cells . However , although it has long been suspected that the evolutionary origins of actin lie in their prokary - otic ancestors , until 2001 no one had reported a credible candidate . The ﬁrst suggestion that MreB may be an an - cestral actin gene was published 10 years ago ( 30 ) , and recently ( 136 ) , it was localized in Bacillus to form distinct ﬁlaments located close to the cell surface . The atomic structure of these ﬁlaments was more recently reported by Fusinita van den Ent and colleagues ( 289 ) at the MRC , Cambridge , who provided convincing evidence that MreB is indeed an ancestral actin gene . This actin look - alike is present in all nonspherical bacteria . Amino acid sequence homology to actin is limited to 15 % ( 289 ) , and although its overall size and shape strongly resemble actin , there are differences . The sequence cor - responding to the actin DNase I - binding loop in subdo - main 2 is larger , and the COOH terminus , located in subdomain 1 , is 20 residues longer . A 2 . 1 - Å resolution crystal structure reveals that , like actin , MreB has two major domains separated by a nucleotide - binding cleft . Also , like actin , each domain has two subdomains with essentially the same topology . The structure of MreB is shown in Figure 2 . MreB can self - assemble into 51 - Å - wide ﬁlaments that are about half the diameter of actin microﬁlaments , but unlike F - actin , they are linear ( nonhelical ) polymers re - sembling the linear polymers seen in actin crystalline sheets ﬁrst reported by ourselves ( 87 ) and later by others ( 3 ) . The axial repeat for MreB microﬁlaments is 51 . 1 Å , somewhat less than the axial repeat of F - actin ( 55 Å ) ( Fig . 436 DOS REMEDIOS ET AL .

These polymers form spirals beneath the bacterial cell wall , and although their precise function remains elusive , it is likely that MreB ﬁlaments behave like microﬁlament analogs and control the shape of bacteria . However , we know nothing of how assembly of this structure is regu - lated , or whether it binds to motor proteins . Figure 3 illustrates the striking similarities between the crystal structure of protoﬁlaments of actin ( right ) and MreB ( left ) . Nearly identical molecular orientations and con - tacts are seen between monomers for the two proteins . Conversion of a pair of actin protoﬁlaments into F - actin is achieved by simply twisting a pair of actin protoﬁlaments to conform to the actin ﬁlament symmetry ( see below ) . E . Models of F - actin The ﬁeld has made substantial progress in under - standing the structure of F - actin . Nearly 40 years ago Jean Hanson and Jack Lowy were the ﬁrst to describe the helical nature of actin ﬁlaments ( 116 ) . In this model , F - actin can be viewed either as a single - start , left - handed tightly wound helix of monomers ( the so - called genetic helix ) or as a two - start , right - handed long - pitch helix . The conventional view of F - actin is the two - start helix because it is probable that the monomer - monomer afﬁnity is stron - ger along the two long - pitch strands than between those strands ( 128 ) . No atomic structure has yet been determined for F - actin , although highly plausible models have been pro - posed based on the model of Holmes et al . ( 128 ) . Figure 4 illustrates ﬁve monomers in a ﬁlament . Viewed along the FIG . 2 . Crystal structure of MreB showing the four - domain motif seen in the actin monomer structure ( 136 ) . The NH 2 and COOH termini are located in subdomain 1A ( equivalent to subdomain 1 of actin ) ( F . van den Ent , personal communication ) . FIG . 3 . A comparison of crystal structure of MreB ( left ) with a model of actin protoﬁlaments ( right ) de - rived from linear polymers along a single strand of F - actin . Five monomers are illustrated in both proto - ﬁlaments . Although the axial repeats between mono - mers differ , the molecular contacts between mono - mers in protoﬁlaments of MreB are essentially the same as the contact between actin monomers along the two strands of F - actin ( van den Ent , personal communication ) . ACTIN AND ACTIN BINDING PROTEINS 437 Physiol Rev • VOL 83 • APRIL 2003 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on O c t obe r 26 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m genetic helix , monomers rotate by (cid:4) 166° and have an axial translation of 27 . 5 Å . There are 13 monomers in 6 turns with a pitch of 59 Å yielding a ﬁlament diameter of (cid:1) 90 – 100 Å ( 128 ) . Contacts between the monomers along this helix occur across the diameter of the ﬁlament . The two - start long - pitch helix is right - handed with a some - what variable half pitch of 360 – 390 Å comprising 12 – 14 monomers per half turn . In this model each monomer is still surrounded by four others . The center - to - center dis - tance between monomers along this helix is (cid:1) 55 Å . These ﬁlaments have a distinct structural polarity that was ﬁrst noticed when the ﬁlaments were “decorated” with myosin fragments , but it can also be seen in good images of F - actin . Thus , despite the passage of nearly 40 years and the best efforts of laboratories in Germany , the United King - dom , the United States , Japan , and elsewhere , the atomic structure of F - actin remains elusive . A major part of the problem is the inherent disorder in linear aggregations of ﬁlaments . Even if they could be aligned with the same polarity , it is difﬁcult to pack F - actin complexed to phal - loidin ( a 7 - residue peptide that dramatically stabilizes actin ﬁlaments ) so there are precise contacts between ﬁlaments . Devices like the innovative trumpet - shaped FIG . 4 . The Holmes model of F - actin showing six monomers , three in each of the two - start long - pitch helix originally described by Holmes et al . ( 128 ) . 438 DOS REMEDIOS ET AL .

( 233 ) achieved greatly improved ﬁlament alignment that yielded the ﬁrst low - angle X - ray diffraction data . More recently , Yuichiro Maeda ( who also worked in Heidelberg and has since returned to the RIKEN SPring8 Institute synchrotron fa - cility in Japan ) and colleagues achieved even better align - ment of F - actin without the help of phalloidin using very high ( 13 . 5 Tesla ) magnetic ﬁelds . They already have struc - tural data out to 5 - Å resolution ( 207 ) , and we can expect them to report further progress in the near future . In the meantime , we must content ourselves with the available models of F - actin based on data from low - reso - lution electron microscope images . The original model ( 128 ) was created by ﬁtting the atomic structure of the actin monomer ( 137 ) to models based on the limited - resolution X - ray diffraction data from aligned ﬁlaments . This model is illustrated in Figure 4 . Subsequently , Mi - chael Lorenz et al . ( 167 ) reﬁned the Holmes ( 128 ) model using data from actin mutations . In the same year Tirion et al . ( 283 ) described the propeller motion of the two major domains about the hinge and then reﬁned the F - actin model to take into account domain motion . Thus it emerged that the actin monomer was not the rigid , static ( double strand of pearls ) structure so commonly de - picted . Monomers in this model are positioned slightly tangential to the ﬁlament axis , with subdomain 1 ( the major myosin S - 1 binding site ) being located at the high - est radius . F - actin displays an arrowhead - like appearance when decorated with myosin subfragment 1 ( S - 1 ) ( 131 , 188 ) . For this reason the opposite ends of the ﬁlament have been named the “barbed” and “pointed” ends . These ends cor - respond to exposed subdomains 1 and 3 and subdomains 2 and 4 , respectively . Quite a different model was proposed by Schutt , Lindberg , and colleagues ( 259 ) based on crystallographic principles and known examples from other structures in biology . In proﬁlin - actin crystals , a “ribbon” structure can be seen in which monomer subdomains 1 and 2 lie close to the ribbon axis . Alternating monomers displayed front and back views . They proposed that monomers were reoriented to produce F - actin . In essence , this group turned the model of Holmes et al . ( 128 ) inside out by rotating the actin monomer about 180° in the plane of the ﬁlament axis . The effect of this was to locate subdomains 1 and 2 closer to the ﬁlament axis , leaving subdomains 3 and 4 at higher radii . These authors further suggested that the subdomains were able to undergo signiﬁcant move - ments relative to each other and that this could feasibly be built into a mechanism of contraction ( 258 ) . Low - resolution ( 25 – 30 Å ) electron microscope stud - ies have revealed that the actin ﬁlament can exist in multiple conformations depending on the type of bound cation and nucleotide , the isoform of actin ( 213 , 214 ) , and the presence of other proteins bound to actin ( 182 , 218 ) . Thus it is now more common to view F - actin as a dy - namic , responsive structure than a passive structural el - ement . F . Assembly of Actin Filaments The most authoritative dissertation on the biophysics of F - actin is Oosawa and Asakura’s slim volume , Thermo - dynamics of the Polymerization of Protein ( 210 ) . Despite its age , this book continues to provide a comprehensive theoretical background for understanding the assembly of actin into ﬁlaments and higher order assemblies . The conditions under which actin monomers self - assemble in vitro are well documented ( 211 ) , although it is fair to say they are less well understood for in vivo assembly . Polymerization is essentially a condensation reac - tion . The main features of this process are 1 ) a slow initial association to a dimer that is more likely to rapidly dis - sociate to monomers than to assemble ; 2 ) the formation of a stable trimer that represents the nucleus of polymer - ization , a state where actin assembly is more likely than is disassembly ; and 3 ) the elongation phase during which actin monomers are rapidly assembled . Solvent condi - tions that promote polymerization include high ionic strength ( KCl concentrations (cid:5) 50 mM ) , neutral or slightly acidic pH , high Mg 2 (cid:2) ( rather than high Ca 2 (cid:2) ) , and ele - vated temperature ( 9 , 111 , 294 ) , in other words , the con - ditions found in cells . In addition to these three processes , actin ﬁlaments are in a continuous state of assembly / disassembly . As a consequence , in the steady state , a small but ﬁnite con - centration of actin monomers will be present in any ﬁla - ment population ( 140 , 211 ) . This concentration of free monomers in equilibrium with a population of actin ﬁla - ments is referred to as the critical concentration and is dependent on solvent conditions , particularly on the pres - ence of certain ABPs and / or actin ligands such as phal - loidin ( 80 ) or latrunculin A ( 193 ) . G . Elongation and Annealing of F - actin Elongation involves association and dissociation of monomers from the ﬁlament . These processes can occur at either end of the ﬁlament , but association predomi - nantly occurs at the barbed end and dissociation at the pointed end . The nucleotide binding site of monomeric actin is almost exclusively associated with ATP in vivo . Conversely , the majority of F - actin subunits contain bound ADP . While the G - actin bound ATP is readily ex - changeable with solvent nucleotides , the ADP of F - actin is essentially nonexchangeable ( 121 ) . Hydrolysis of bound ATP was originally thought to be tightly coupled to the polymerization process ( 210 , 300 ) ; however , subsequent investigations ( 44 , 46 , 77 , 221 ) revealed that a time lag ACTIN AND ACTIN BINDING PROTEINS 439 Physiol Rev • VOL 83 • APRIL 2003 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on O c t obe r 26 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m exists between the incorporation of ATP - G - actin onto the ﬁlament end and hydrolysis of the bound nucleotide . The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis and release of its product , P i ( 43 ) , suggests that the bound ATP of newly added actin subunits is hydrolyzed through two distinct sequential steps as illustrated in the following reaction scheme ATP - G - actin 7 ATP - F - actin 3 Fast ADP - P i - F - actin 7 Slow ADP - F - actin (cid:2) P i The rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated to be 10 times higher than the rate of P i release , suggesting that ADP - P i - F - actin is the major intermediate in the nucleotide hydro - lysis process . Conversion of ATP to ADP - P i and then to ADP (cid:2) P i is not random but primarily occurs at the growing ( barbed ) ends of ﬁlaments ( 47 ) . Depolymerization of actin is not simply the opposite of polymerization , principally because actin cannot regen - erate ATP from ADP and P i ( 45 ) . Instead , dissociated ADP - actin subunits rapidly exchange their bound ADP for ATP in solution ( 200 ) , a process that is accelerated by proﬁlin ( see below ) . Polymerization of actin is not depen - dent on nucleotide hydrolysis . It is possible under special circumstances to form F - actin from G - actin containing either no bound nucleotide ( 141 , 227 ) or a nonhydrolyz - able analog of ATP ( 63 ) . However , nucleotide hydrolysis is required for the normal function of F - actin . The structural polarity of the actin ﬁlament and the irreversible nature of ATP hydrolysis during actin assem - bly have implications for the rate and direction of ﬁlament growth at opposite ends of F - actin . The critical concen - tration for the pointed end is 12 - to 15 - fold higher than for the barbed end under physiological conditions ( 301 ) . This difference may result in the unidirectional growth of the actin ﬁlament due to a continual ﬂux of actin subunits from the pointed to the barbed end of the ﬁlament . This reaction is called “treadmilling” ( 300 ) . Under in vivo conditions one might expect that all or most of the actin exists in an assembled ( ﬁlamentous ) form . Slow addition at the barbed end and even slower dissociation at the pointed end of the ﬁlaments produces a rate of treadmilling ( 300 ) of monomers ( (cid:1) 2 (cid:4) m / h ) that is (cid:1) 200 - fold slower than observed in vivo . Monomers move progressively along the ﬁlament from the barbed end ( the end associated with Z - disks of the sarcomere , or the cell membrane where rufﬂing occurs in motile cells ) toward the free pointed end of the ﬁlament ( located in the middle of the sarcomere or oriented away from the cell membrane ) . ABPs present in vivo regulate different as - pects of the assembly / disassembly process . These include ﬁlament stabilizers ( e . g . , tropomyosin ) , capping proteins ( e . g . , CapZ , tropomodulin ) , ABPs that promote branching ( e . g . , Arp2 / 3 ) , and ABPs that sequester G - actin and thus maintain a pool of monomers in solution ( e . g . , thymosin (cid:1) 4 , proﬁlin ) . Finally , ﬁlament lengths are affected by fragmenta - tion and annealing . Fragmentation can arise from thermal motion in vitro , but in vivo much of this will be con - strained by the other contents of the cytoplasm . Anneal - ing occurs when an existing ﬁlament binds to the appro - priate end of a second ﬁlament . This has been observed directly using ﬂuorescent - phalloidin - labeled single ﬁla - ments ( Ishiwata , personal communication ) and has been quantiﬁed ( 2 . 2 (cid:4) M (cid:4) 1 (cid:1) s (cid:4) 1 ) under similar conditions ( 145 ) . Arp2 / 3 ( discussed below ) is believed to create branch points in actin microﬁlaments by “capturing” existing ﬁl - aments . III . ACTIN BINDING PROTEINS Actin binds a substantial number of proteins collec - tively called ABPs . Some years ago , Pollard and Cooper ( 231 ) identiﬁed a large number of ABPs , and recently we counted 162 distinct and separate proteins without in - cluding their many synonyms or isoforms . No doubt more will be identiﬁed . Many of the known ABPs bind to the same loci on the surface of actin and therefore can be expected to compete . A few bind with positive coopera - tivity and tend to form ternary complexes ( see below ) but rather more bind with negative cooperativity . In myoﬁ - brils , at least eight sarcomeric proteins bind to the thin ﬁlaments . At least 12 ABPs are membrane - associated pro - teins , and another nine are membrane receptors or ion transporters . Thirteen ABPs cross - link actin ﬁlaments , whereas others enable ﬁlaments to interact with other elements of the cytoskeleton . Microﬁlaments probably do not interact directly with microtubules and / or intermedi - ate ﬁlaments but do so via linker proteins . Actin also binds (cid:1) 30 other ligands including drugs and toxins . Thus the sheer number of ligands that have a signiﬁcant afﬁnity for actin strongly suggests there is probably a large number of binding sites that cover much of the exposed surface of the molecule . A comprehensive list is available from Actin ( 266 ) , the Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins ( 151 ) , and most recently from the two - volume Molecular Interactions of Actin ( 88 ) . Attempts to classify these ABPs leave many “or - phans” that do not ﬁt into families , so any attempt to group them is bound to be somewhat arbitrary . Classiﬁ - cations according to the function of ABPs or their con - sensus sequences can also be problematic . Several types of ABPs facilitate disassembly and as - sembly . Below is a review of the most common ABPs . Classiﬁcation of these ABPs can be reduced to seven 440 DOS REMEDIOS ET AL .

( Note : C . E . Schutt and Uno Lindberg are completing an extensive review of Actin Monomer Binding Proteins to be published in the Protein Proﬁle series of Oxford University Press . ) 2 ) Filament - depolymerizing proteins induce the conversion of F - to G - actin ( e . g . , CapZ and coﬁlin ) . 3 ) Filament end - binding proteins cap the ends of the actin ﬁlament preventing the exchange of monomers at the pointed end ( e . g . , tropomodulin ) and at the barbed end ( e . g . , CapZ ) . 4 ) Filament severing proteins shorten the average length of ﬁlaments by binding to the side of F - actin and cutting it into two pieces ( e . g . , gelsolin ) . ( Note : H . Hinssen is completing an extensive review on the Gelsolin Family to be published in the Protein Proﬁle series of Oxford University Press . ) 5 ) Cross - linking pro - teins contain at least two binding sites for F - actin , thus facilitating the formation of ﬁlament bundles , branching ﬁlaments , and three - dimensional networks ( e . g . , Arp2 / 3 ) . 6 ) Stabilizing proteins bind to the sides of actin ﬁlaments and prevent depolymerization ( e . g . , tropomyosin ) . 7 ) Mo - tor proteins that use F - actin as a track upon which to move ( e . g . , the myosin family of motors ) . Here we con - sider only groups 1 – 4 . ABPs are not limited to one class , for example , gel - solin is capable of severing and capping the barbed end of actin ﬁlaments , and the Arp2 / 3 complex can nucleate ﬁlament formation , elongate ﬁlaments , and establish branch points in actin networks ( 69 ) . In this review we have selected eight ABPs that are biologically relevant and have atomic structures or good working models . The rapid assembly of actin ﬁlaments is the principal driving force behind many forms of cell locomotion . Cells can migrate at rates up to (cid:1) 0 . 5 (cid:4) m / s ( 264 ) . This means that ﬁlaments must have a net rate of elongation that is slightly less than 200 monomers / s . Principally this occurs at their barbed ends where MgATP - actin assembles about ﬁve times faster than MgADP - actin ( 149 ) . The exchange of ATP for ADP in ﬁlaments is so slow ( of the order of days , Ref . 201 ) it can be ignored . At steady state , ﬁlament length is constant , but there is a slow turnover ( (cid:1) 2 (cid:4) m / h ) ( 264 ) of monomers due to a treadmilling process that involves the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP - P i - actin and then a slower dissociation of P i leaving most of the monomers in the ﬁlament with bound MgADP . Thus , if pure actin ﬁlaments treadmill very slowly and if actin assembly is the driver of cell motility , then the intrinsic rate of treadmilling must increase in vivo . This is the task of the ABPs . A . ADF / Coﬁlin Family Unlike so many of the ABPs , the actin depolymeriz - ing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin family of proteins is expressed in virtually all eukaryotic cells . They are relatively small ( 15 – 19 kDa ) proteins that exist in multiple isoforms . Their main functions include the rapid recycling of actin mono - mers associated with membrane rufﬂing and with cytoki - nesis . Different genes encode for ADF and coﬁlin , but although it is common to regard them as synonymous , they are distinctly different . 1 . Members of the family ADF / coﬁlin was ﬁrst discovered and puriﬁed in 1980 from embryonic chick brain extracts by Bamburg et al . ( 20 ) . Since then , the family has grown to include a number of related proteins , including invertebrate depactin ( named because it depolymerizes actin ) ( 173 ) ; porcine ADF or destrin ( destroys F - actin ) ( 191 ) ; coﬁlin ( cosedi - ments with ﬁlamentous actin ) ( 1 ) , Acanthamoeba acto - phorin ( 236 ) ; Dictyostelium coactosin ( 82 ) , Drosophila twinstar or D - 61 ( 91 ) ; unc - 60A and unc - 60B from Caeno - rhabditis ( 185 ) ; Xenopus Acs ( or XAC1 and XAC2 ) ( 2 ) ; and ﬁnally Toxoplasma ADF ( 4 ) . All of these share con - siderable ( 30 – 40 % ) amino acid sequence identity . Fur - thermore , two other major protein families are related to ADF through the presence of an ADF homology domain . One protein has a duplication of this domain and is con - sequently called twinﬁlin ; the other contains a single ADF homology domain linked to another motif and encodes the drebin family of proteins ( 16 ) . Despite this somewhat confusing array of homologs , vertebrates have genes for only two forms , ADF and coﬁlin . The names alone suggest that one depolymerizes F - actin ( ADF ) while coﬁlin cosediments with F - actin , but actually both can elevate the levels of monomeric actin and both can bind to F - actin . Only one isoform of ADF is known in mammals ( and birds ) , whereas two are known for coﬁlin . ADF and coﬁlin are clearly different but related proteins . Coﬁlin is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of quiescent cells . However , in active cells , it translocates to cortical regions where the actin cytoskeleton is highly dynamic and drives the rufﬂing of membranes of motile cells ( 18 , 309 ) , the cleavage furrow of dividing cells ( 197 ) , the advancing of neuronal growth cones ( 18 , 198 ) , and myoﬁbrillogenesis ( 206 ) . ADF and coﬁlin are not neces - sarily expressed at the same level in all tissues . In adults , ADF is relatively highly expressed in nerves , intestine , kidney , and testes ( 18 ) , whereas coﬁlin levels are higher in hematopoietic tissues , bone osteoclasts , and ﬁbro - blasts ( 309 ) . In baby hamster kidney cells , ADF consti - tutes 0 . 4 % of the soluble protein , while coﬁlin accounts for 1 . 3 % ( 148 ) . The total ADF and coﬁlin amounts to 20 (cid:4) M in cells where the total actin concentration is more than three times higher ( 67 (cid:4) m ) ( 148 ) ( see Table 1 ) .

ACTIN AND ACTIN BINDING PROTEINS 443 Physiol Rev • VOL 83 • APRIL 2003 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on O c t obe r 26 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Recently , Vartiainen et al . ( 291 ) clariﬁed the ADF / coﬁlin nomenclatures for vertebrates . Using mice , they proposed that coﬁlin 1 is expressed in most tissues of embryonic and adult cells , coﬁlin 2 is expressed in muscle cells , and ADF is limited to epithelial and endothelial cells . More importantly , they deﬁned the functional simi - larities and differences between them . 2 . Structure of ADF / cofilin Porcine destrin was the ﬁrst structure in this family of proteins to be solved by NMR spectroscopy ( 118 ) . Subsequently , atomic structures of three more members of the ADF / coﬁlin family have been determined . A ribbon representation of yeast coﬁlin is shown in Figure 5 A FIG . 5 . A : the atomic structure of yeast coﬁlin solved at 1 . 8 Å showing the NH 2 and COOH termini . Putative sites for binding F - actin and G - actin ( purple helix ) are located in the COOH - terminal region of the molecule .

Crystal structures have also been determined for both Acanthamoeba actophorin ( 161 ) and a plant ADF from Arabidopsis thaliana ( 32 ) . No atomic structure has been published for any vertebrate coﬁlin or for any muscle ADF / coﬁlin , but the atomic coordinates for a high - resolution NMR structure for chick coﬁlin from embryonic skeletal muscle were recently deposited in the BioMagRes Bank ( http : / / bmrb . wisc . edu ) under BMRB ac - cession number 5177 ( 11 ) . Indirect methods have been used to examine the sites on coﬁlin that bind to actin . Despite the best efforts of several groups , these two proteins have not yet been cocrystallized , and consequently , unlike DNase I , gelsolin segment 1 , and proﬁlin , the precise contact sites between coﬁlin and actin are not known . Structural homologies between coﬁlin , gelsolin , and proﬁlin strongly suggest they bind to the same region of G - actin ( i . e . , to subdo - mains 1 and 3 ) . However , the functional products of sys - tematic mutagenesis of yeast coﬁlin indicate that the co - ﬁlin - actin interaction is distinctly different . Competitive binding of a synthetic dodecapeptide ( residues 104 – 115 of vertebrate coﬁlin ) has implicated this region in the interaction of coﬁlin with monomeric but not with ﬁlamentous actin ( 308 ) . This peptide is largely conserved in other members of the ADF / coﬁlin family including destrin and depactin , suggesting that it may be a consensus sequence essential for actin binding and depolymerizing activities . Mutagenesis of surface residues for both yeast ( 158 ) and chick ( 154 ) coﬁlin have implicated the NH 2 - terminal region in G - actin binding . Zero - length cross - linking of G - actin to vertebrate coﬁlin by 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylamino - propyl ) carbodiimide ( 308 ) revealed that either Lys - 112 and / or Lys - 114 of coﬁlin is in direct contact with actin . Mutations of these cross - linked residues ( 192 ) , or the corresponding Arg - 96 and Lys - 98 of yeast coﬁlin , totally abolished actin binding . Thus a signiﬁcant fraction of the surface residues has been implicated in the binding of coﬁlin to G - and F - actin ( Fig . 5 A , circles ) and within these areas , eight or nine residues ( solid spheres ) are consid - ered essential . Despite the absence of cocrystals , the coﬁlin structure has been “docked” onto the Kabsch et al . ( 137 ) actin structure ( Fig . 5 B ) using energy minimization techniques ( 304 ) . This ﬁgure provides a clear view of the structural relationship between these two proteins and is presented so it can be compared with the binding sites for proﬁlin and DNase I ( see below ) . Bamburg ( 16 ) recently stressed the importance of switching from an ADF / coﬁlin system to a tropomyosin - based regulation of F - actin function . Tropomyosin binds along the grooves of the long pitch helix of F - actin . In myoﬁbrils , where tropomyosin is constitutively ex - pressed , the binding of tropomyosin and coﬁlin to actin ﬁlaments is mutually exclusive and competitive ( 311 ) . Thus the depolymerizing activity of coﬁlin is inhibited by the presence of muscle and nonmuscle tropomyosins ( 17 ) . Tropomyosin is located deeper into the cortex from the site of active actin assembly and its presence probably inhibits coﬁlin binding ( 28 ) . Coﬁlin and phalloidin also compete for binding to F - actin ( 120 ) , even though their binding sites are separated by 15 – 20 Å . McGough et al . ( 182 ) proposed that an allosteric change in the twist of F - actin induced by coﬁlin may inhibit phalloidin from binding between monomers close to the ﬁlament axis . The blue residues in Figure 6 represent the probable minimal molecular contacts for ADF / coﬁlin on actin . The principal motif shown in Figure 5 , A and B ( a 4 - stranded (cid:1) - sheet surrounded by 4 (cid:2) - helices ) , is also found in an unrelated sequence of gelsolin segment 1 . It is therefore not surprising that coﬁlin competes with gelsolin segment 1 and proﬁlin ( 85 ) for binding to G - actin . Both proﬁlin and gelsolin segment 1 bind to the barbed end of the actin monomer ( subdomains 1 and 3 ) , even though only Glu - 167 and Tyr - 169 ( see Table 1 ) are common binding sites . Because coﬁlin competes with both proteins , it is possible that it too interacts with residues in the 162 – 176 loop of actin subdomain 3 ( see Fig . 1 A ) . The structural sites to which coﬁlin binds along the outside of the ﬁlament are not known in atomic detail , so the blue residues in Figure 6 are based on chemical cross - linking and other data . At low resolution ( 25 Å ) , ADF / coﬁlin bridges subdomains 1 and 3 of an upper actin to subdomains 1 and 2 of a lower actin in a ﬁlament . The major axis of coﬁlin makes a 30° angle with the plane normal to the helical axis of the ﬁlament . It is centered ( axially ) at about the position of subdomain 2 of the lower actin subunit and radially at the cleft between subdo - mains 1 and 3 of the upper actin subunit . Electron cryo - microscopy and helical reconstructions of F - actin deco - rated with coﬁlin revealed its ability to reduce the angle of rotation between subunits along the short - pitched left - handed genetic helix by 3 – 5° ( 182 ) . There is no effect on the axial rise per actin subunit , and consequently , the long - pitch helical repeat of F - actin is decreased from (cid:1) 360 to 270 Å , and the diameter increases slightly . The change of helical pitch can even be seen in negatively stained ﬁlaments in the absence of coﬁlin ( Fig . 7 a ) and in the presence of stoichiometric coﬁlin ( Fig . 7 b ) . We are grateful to Roger Craig for providing these micrographs . 3 . Cellular functions A ) TREADMILLING . The ADF / coﬁlin family is almost sin - gle - handedly credited for the high rate of treadmilling of monomers in actin ﬁlaments in vivo . This is achieved in part by increasing ( by 30 - fold ) the off rate ( 9 s (cid:4) 1 , Ref . 240 ) at the pointed ends of ﬁlaments without changing the off rate at the barbed ends ( 42 ) . However , in the presence of proﬁlin ( see sect . III B ) , the rate of pointed - end disassem - bly is even faster ( 125 s (cid:4) 1 , Ref . 85 ) . The resulting elevated ACTIN AND ACTIN BINDING PROTEINS 445 Physiol Rev • VOL 83 • APRIL 2003 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on O c t obe r 26 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m concentration of coﬁlin - G - actin in the cytoplasm can be rapidly recycled at the barbed end of ﬁlaments , provided that ATP can replace the actin - bound nucleotide . This concept is illustrated in Figure 8 . In vivo , the concentra - tion of ADF / coﬁlin is low relative to other ABPs such as proﬁlin and thymosin (cid:1) 4 ( see discussion below ) . ADF / coﬁlin “decoration” of actin ﬁlaments is probably re - stricted to their “aged” ends where ATP has been con - verted to ADP , i . e . , some distance from the membrane surface where the ﬁlaments are actively growing ( see below ) . B ) DEPOLYMERIZATION . At steady state , increasing the rate of dissociation at the pointed end would not depoly - merize actin ﬁlaments if the released monomers were able to reassemble at the barbed end . However , if a barbed - end capping protein ( e . g . , CapZ ) blocks reassembly , then co - ﬁlin will depolymerize actin ﬁlaments . C ) NUCLEATION OF POLYMERIZATION . ADF / coﬁlin can nucle - ate the assembly of actin , and this function is likely to be especially important in the presence of barbed - end block - ers like CapZ . The ability to nucleate assembly is probably pH dependent and may vary between different isoforms of ADF / coﬁlin . D ) ADP - ACTIN . Binding of ADF / coﬁlin to actin is regu - lated , at least in part , by the state of the nucleotide bound to actin . It binds to ADP - actin with about two orders of magnitude greater afﬁnity than to ATP - actin ( Table 1 ) or ADP - P i - actin , and this is true for both the G - and F - actin ( 42 ) at pH 7 . 8 . Thus coﬁlin not only promotes the disas - sembly of ADP - actin monomers from ﬁlaments , but it also binds to released ADP - actin monomers and inhibits the exchange of their bound nucleotide ( 202 ) . The off rate at the pointed ends of ﬁlaments is probably the rate - limiting step in the recycling of disassociated actin subunits ( 281 ) . The extent of depolymerization by ADF / coﬁlin depends on several factors ; for example , different isoforms may have differing pH sensitivities ( 240 , 183 ) , and other ABPs can inﬂuence the binding of coﬁlin to actin because they share binding sites . E ) SEVERING . Marie - France Carlier et al . ( 42 ) argue that the kinetic effects of ADF / coﬁlin are speciﬁc for the ends of ﬁlaments and therefore it cannot sever . However , the rate of ﬁlament fragmentation would not have to be very great to increase the disassembly rate from (cid:1) 125 s (cid:4) 1 in vitro to the rate required to match the speed of motility ( (cid:1) 200 s (cid:4) 1 ) . Evidence based on light microscopy ( 119 ) suggests that ﬁlaments are rapidly depolymerized by ADF at slightly alkaline pH . Also , there is a difference in sev - ering activities of recombinant and native coﬁlin where the native form is more active than the recombinant co - ﬁlin . Recombinant coﬁlins can vary in their severing ac - tivity and can give the impression that they have only weak severing activity ( 132 ) . Thus it remains unclear whether ADF / coﬁlin can sever actin ﬁlaments like true severing proteins or whether the highly cooperative bind - FIG . 6 . The molecular contact sites between actin ( shown here as Van der Waals representations ) and ABP sites . “Front” ( A ) and “back” ( B ) views of the monomer are shown where the binding sites are colored : row 1 : yellow , actin monomer - monomer interaction sites ; light green , DNase I ; and blue , ADF / coﬁlin ; row 2 : dark green , thymosin (cid:1) 4 ; and red , proﬁlin ; row 3 : pink , gelsolin segment 1 ; and black , vitamin D - binding protein ; row 4 : red , CapZ sites . There is signiﬁcant overlap between the actin binding sites for ADF / coﬁlin , proﬁlin , gelsolin seg - ment 1 , and CapZ and are therefore shown on separate ﬁgures . These are the minimal contacts and are based on chemical cross - linking and mutagenesis data . 446 DOS REMEDIOS ET AL .

Recently , Ed Egelman and colleagues ( 104 ) reported ﬁlament severing in the presence of two coﬁlins ( yeast ) per actin subunit . These were seen by electron microscopy as two distinct sites in image reconstructions . This raises the question of whether one or two coﬁlins bind to actin monomers , a feature which may depend on the isoform of coﬁlin . Thus the question is whether coﬁlin accelerates treadmilling by severing or depolymerizing F - actin . Current opinion seems to favor the severing ability of coﬁlin . 4 . Cellular concentrations The cellular concentrations of ADF / coﬁlin are sub - stantially lower than the concentration of actin , so it is unlikely there is sufﬁcient ADF / coﬁlin present in cells ( 20 (cid:4) M , Ref . 148 ) to bind to all polymerized and unpolymer - ized actins ( 65 (cid:4) M ; see Table 1 ) , even taking into account its low afﬁnity for ATP - or ADP - P i - actins . Furthermore , the binding of ADF / coﬁlin to ﬁlaments is cooperative ( 182 ) . If there is not enough ADF / coﬁlin to act as a mono - mer - sequestering protein , this role probably belongs to proﬁlin and thymosin (cid:1) 4 ( see below ) . Relatively few ABPs bind to the pointed compared with the barbed end of a ﬁlament . Coﬁlin can compete with 1 ) spectrin that stabilizes short - actin oligomers ( see below ) ( 254 ) ; 2 ) tropomodulin that caps the pointed end of tropomyosin - coated actin ﬁlaments in muscle and non - muscle cells ( 97 ) ; 3 ) DNase I , which binds very tightly to the pointed end of actin monomers but only weakly to actin ﬁlaments ( see sect . III E ) ; and 4 ) new pointed - end ABPs that are likely to be identiﬁed from proteins that currently are either orphans or have not yet been identiﬁed in gene arrays and two - dimensional gel electrophoresis . A number of isoforms of coﬁlin have been described , and it is possible that not all members of the family perform the same functions under the same conditions ( e . g . , divalent cations and pH ) ( 128 ) . Some coﬁlins bind tightly to actin monomers while others do not ( Noswor - thy , unpublished observations ) . Some cosediment with F - actin while others have only a low afﬁnity ( 120 ) . Some promote actin assembly while others rapidly depolymer - ize it ( 128 ) . Human coﬁlin seems to be a better nucleator of assembly whereas ADF is a better polymerizing agent , FIG . 7 .

( Micrographs provided by Roger Craig . ) FIG . 8 . A cartoon representation of F - actin in the absence ( left ) and presence ( right ) of coﬁlin . Coﬁlins ( red crescents ) preferentially bind to ADP - containing monomers in the ﬁlament and induce a small change in the angular rotation of monomers in the ﬁlament with a consequent slight increase in ﬁlament diameter and decrease in ﬁlament length . Coﬁlin accelerates the off rate at the pointed ends of the ﬁlaments . Actin monomers are represented as having a small and a large domain and are color coded according to their bound nucleotide ( brown for ATP , orange for ADP - P i , and yellow for ADP ) . ACTIN AND ACTIN BINDING PROTEINS 447 Physiol Rev • VOL 83 • APRIL 2003 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on O c t obe r 26 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m and this is reﬂected in their respective K d values ( 42 , 240 ) ( Table 1 ) . If different isoforms of coﬁlin have different effects on microﬁlament assembly , are they differentially ex - pressed within a cell ? Mouse myocyte cells lines express signiﬁcant amounts of ADF . Elevated expression of actin causes a downregulation of ADF and decreases spreading of these cells without changing the levels of coﬁlin ( 256 ) . Regulating ADF / coﬁlin expression is likely to be slow ( on a time scale of tens of minutes / hours ) and , apart from being energetically wasteful , it is unlikely to be an effec - tive way of enabling microﬁlaments to respond quickly to environmental stimuli . However , because most ABPs bind with moderate to low afﬁnity ( in the micromolar range ) , elevated levels of ADF / coﬁlin could , over time , subtly shift the balance of ABPs and , by mass action , alter the state of assembly of cytoskeletal microﬁlaments . 5 . Phosphorylation of ADF / cofilin The ability of coﬁlin to bind G - actin is also regulated by phosphorylation of Ser - 3 , which is conserved in most members of the ADF / coﬁlin family . When ADF / coﬁlin is phosphorylated , there is a sharp fall in its afﬁnity for actin ( 190 ) . ADP exchange in G - actin is strongly inhibited by coﬁlin , but once coﬁlin is phosphorylated , the released ADP - actin monomer can exchange with cytoplasmic ATP , and it is now ready for reincorporation at the barbed end of a growing ﬁlament . Typically , this occurs at the inter - face of the microﬁlaments and the membrane at the lead - ing edge of the moving cell . Thus cellular microﬁlament turnover can potentially be regulated by cycles of phos - phorylation and dephosphorylation . As we will see below , proﬁlin plays an important role here . We know that in yeast , phosphorylation is not a regulatory factor whereas it is in most vertebrates . An important question is , How much of total cellular ADF / coﬁlin is phosphorylated ? For most cells , we simply do not have this information , but in amoeba (cid:1) 30 % of acto - phorin is phosphorylated ( 29 ) . On balance , it seems likely that , since not all of ADF / coﬁlin is constitutively active , there may be mechanisms other than phosphorylation that control actin assembly - disassembly in vertebrates . Phosphorylation of vertebrate coﬁlin is achieved by LIM - kinase proteins 1 and 2 ( LIMK - 1 and LIMK - 2 ) . LIMK - 1 is predominantly neuronal , whereas LIMK - 2 is more wide - spread ( 26 , 187 ) . Although the signaling pathway for ac - tivation of the LIM - kinases is not yet fully understood , it is known that LIMK - 1 is under the control of the small GTPase Rac ( 307 ) , whereas LIMK - 2 is regulated by the GTPase cdc42 and rho ( 21 ) ( see discussion below ) . LIMKs are themselves regulated by phosphorylation of a Thr residue ( 90 ) . In Acanthamoeba , activation of LIM - kinase by Pak1 ( 91 ) results in phosphorylation of Ser - 1 ( the Acanthamoeba version of Ser - 3 ) of actophorin ( 29 ) . When expressed in cultured cells , LIMK - 1 induces actin reorga - nization and reverses coﬁlin - induced depolymerization ( 307 ) . Expression of inactive LIMK - 1 results in the accu - mulation of F - actin ﬁlaments ( 7 ) . Phosphorylation of co - ﬁlin appears to increase with pH - induced activation of coﬁlin , consistent with a compensating homeostatic mechanism ( 27 ) . Although NH 2 - terminal Ser residues ( Ser - 1 , - 3 , - 4 , and / or - 6 in different species ) are recognized as the site for phosphorylation , it is not clear whether the resulting inhibition of actin binding involves a steric or conforma - tional change . Recently , Blanchoin et al . ( 29 ) examined this question by crystallizing Acanthamoeba actophorin ( ADF / coﬁlin ) in the phosphorylated state . Their structure was essentially identical to unphosphorylated ADF / coﬁ - lin , and they concluded that inhibition of activity by LIM - kinase was not due to a conformational change at the ADF / coﬁlin - actin interface . Their reported steric blocking of actin binding was consistent with molecular dynamics predictions ( Fig . 5 B ) and with site - directed mutant stud - ies . Frustratingly , Ser - 1 residue in these crystals could not be resolved . Until recently , the mechanism by which coﬁlin is dephosphorylated was not well understood . Slingshot , a protein phosphatase with F - actin binding ability , was shown by Niwa et al . ( 204 ) to dephosphorylate coﬁlin in cultured cells and in cell - free assays . In Drosophila , loss of this enzyme results in a dramatic increase in cellular levels of both F - actin and phosphorylated coﬁlin . 6 . Inhibition by phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate The activity of ADF / coﬁlin can be regulated by the membrane lipids phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PIP ) and phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) ( 309 ) . These bind to and inhibit the actin - binding domain of ADF / coﬁlin at residues 104 – 115 and the NH 2 - terminal region ( 154 ) and suggest that transmembrane signaling by PIP 2 can regulate the function of ADF / coﬁlin . Little is known of the molecular nature of this binding site . 7 . pH effect The ability of ADF / coﬁlin to assemble or disassemble F - actin is pH dependent in vitro ( 311 ) . Acidic conditions ( less than pH 6 . 8 ) enhance the ability of ADF / coﬁlin to stabilize F - actin while at more alkaline pH ( (cid:5) 7 . 3 ) , coﬁlin can rapidly depolymerize F - actin . Furthermore , the criti - cal concentration of the coﬁlin - actin complex is known to be pH dependent , being low ( (cid:1) 2 (cid:4) M ) at pH 6 . 5 and signiﬁcantly higher ( 7 (cid:4) M ) at pH 8 . 2 ( 240 ) . Conversely , it has been suggested that the severing activity of coﬁlin is pH independent ( 89 ) . The physiological signiﬁcance of this pH dependency is that actin ﬁlaments may be stabi - lized in the vicinity of membrane Na (cid:2) - H (cid:2) antiports ( 16 ) . A more recent report ( 27 ) focused on the role of pH in vivo . 448 DOS REMEDIOS ET AL .

In contrast , coﬁlin is much less responsive to altered pH , and there are no reports of structural changes induced in either ADF or coﬁlin , despite the fact that its structure has been deter - mined by both NMR spectroscopy ( 11 ) and crystallogra - phy ( 158 ) . 8 . Nuclear translocation sequence All vertebrate ADF / coﬁlin ( destrin ) sequences con - tain a putative nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) that enables it to migrate from its normal location in the cytoplasm to the nucleus under conditions of cellular stress ( 203 ) . Heat shock and other forms of stress prob - ably affect a few residues immediately preceding the NLS , which expose it for subsequent binding to a nuclear trans - port factor and thus passage through the nuclear pores ( 32 ) . Transport is an active process , and actin accompa - nies the coﬁlin into the nucleus , although the signiﬁcance of this is not clear . B . Proﬁlin Family The proﬁlin family of ABPs is found in eukaryotic cells from Acanthamoeba through to human and in many but not all species there are two or more proﬁlin genes ( 230 ) . Proﬁlins are small proteins with an approximate molecular mass of 19 kDa ( 6 ) . They are among the most highly expressed ( 20 – 100 (cid:4) M , Ref . 37 ) of the cytoplasmic proteins and are distributed throughout the cytoplasm . Like coﬁlin and DNase I , proﬁlin can be denatured in 8 M urea and then renatured by dialysis ( 138 ) , a property used during its puriﬁcation . 1 . Atomic structure X - ray diffraction and NMR atomic resolution struc - tures are available for no less than six isoforms of proﬁlin . All are very similar . Proﬁlin has also been cocrystallized with actin in two different conformations , the so - called “closed” and “open” states ( 60 ) . It was on the basis of these two structures that Schutt et al . ( 259 ) developed their model of F - actin ( discussed above ) . Within the pro - ﬁlins , the NH 2 - terminal sequence is conserved whereas the COOH - terminal region of certain isoforms resembles gelsolin ( see below ) . The atomic structure of the proﬁlin - (cid:3) - actin complex is illustrated in Figure 9 . Proﬁlin binds to subdomains 1 and 3 at loci that substantially overlap the binding sites of gelsolin segment - 1 ( 259 ) . Its main crystal contacts with actin are as follows : subdomain 1 , 113 , 354 , 355 , 361 , 364 , 369 , 371 , 373 , 375 ; subdomain 3 , 166 , 167 , 169 , 171 – 173 , 284 , 286 – 288 , 290 ( see Fig . 6 ) . 2 . Cellular functions Proﬁlin has several cellular functions . It is essentially a high - afﬁnity ( K a (cid:6) 10 7 M (cid:4) 1 ) monomer - binding protein ( 225 ) . It is best known for its ability to promote the exchange of nucleotide in actin monomers released from ﬁlaments ( 109 ) and , because the high ( millimolar ) con - centrations of Mg - ATP in the cytoplasm , it catalyzes the exchange of ADP for ATP . It achieves this by binding to subdomains 1 and 3 near the hinge between the two major domains ( see Figs . 6 and 9 ) and modulates the opening of the nucleotide cleft . Proﬁlin enhances ﬁlament turnover in the presence of coﬁlin ( 85 ) because the two proteins act at opposite ends of a ﬁlament , with proﬁlin adding ATP - actin to the barbed end and coﬁlin dissociating ADP - actin from the pointed end ( see Fig . 10 ) . Proﬁlin also inhibits the hydrolysis of ATP bound to actin , thus main - taining actin monomers in a state where they retain a high afﬁnity for the growing barbed end of ﬁlaments ( 6 ) . While proﬁlin acts as an effective buffer for high monomer concentrations in cells , it can promote polymer - ization by transporting monomers to the fast - growing barbed ends of ﬁlaments . Proﬁlin binds to a site on actin ( see row 2 in Fig . 6 ) that is inaccessible in the Holmes model of the ﬁlament ( 128 ) ( see Fig . 4 ) . Thus , after deliv - FIG . 9 . A ribbon diagram of the atomic ( 2 . 55 - Å resolution ) structure of proﬁlin ( red ) cocrystallized with monomeric actin where the orien - tation of actin is about the same as seen in Figure 5 B ( 259 ) . ACTIN AND ACTIN BINDING PROTEINS 449 Physiol Rev • VOL 83 • APRIL 2003 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on O c t obe r 26 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m ering a monomer to the growing end of the ﬁlament , it must either move to a new site that does not block assembly or completely dissociate . This can occur even when actin is complexed to thymosin ( see below ) be - cause of the high exchange rates for both thymosin and proﬁlin ( 219 ) . It is not clear why some cells employ thy - mosin to buffer actin monomers while others use proﬁlin . Proﬁlin binds only very weakly to the pointed ends of ﬁlaments . Dissociation of proﬁlin from actin is stimulated by PIP and PIP 2 ( 108 ) ; thus proﬁlin may play a role in transmitting signals between the cell membrane and the actin cytoskeleton . Proﬁlin binds to Arp2 in the Arp2 / 3 complex ( see sect . III G ) . These functions are schematically illustrated in Fig - ure 10 . Here proﬁlin is shown as blue rhomboids that bind to the barbed end of F - actin . The blue arrows indicate the cycle of proﬁlin - actin interactions . C . Gelsolin Superfamily Gelsolin belongs to a superfamily of ABPs expressed in all eukaryotes . The grouping includes ( but is not lim - ited to ) gelsolin , villin , adseverin ( also known as scind - erin ) , CapG , ﬂil , and severin ( aka fragmin ) . All contain at least one of the 120 - amino acid structural repeats and many have three or six gelsolin repeats ( 157 ) . For exam - ple , villin ( 92 . 5 kDa ) is a six - domain ABP that regulates actin assembly in microvilli . It has a Ca 2 (cid:2) - dependent NH 2 - terminal half ( 180 ) , whereas CapG ( aka gCap39 ) is a smaller , three - domain gelsolin analog that cannot sever F - actin but responds to Ca 2 (cid:2) and PIP 2 under conditions where gelsolin is ineffective ( 312 ) . Unlike ADF / coﬂin and proﬁlin , an isoform of intra - cellular gelsolin can circulate in plasma where it severs and caps actin ﬁlaments released into the circulation ( e . g . , following cell death ) . The resulting actin monomers and oligomers are then strongly sequestered by vitamin D - binding protein ( DBP ) and ultimately removed from the circulation in the liver ( 124 ) . Plasma gelsolin is slightly larger ( 83 kDa ) than cytosolic gelsolin and is derived by alternative splicing of a single gene resulting in a short peptide appended to its NH 2 terminus ( 155 ) . Otherwise , the sequences of plasma and intracellular gelsolins are identical . 1 . Structure of gelsolin and gelsolin / F - actin Gelsolin is an 80 - kDa protein consisting of two tan - dem homologous halves ( segments 1 – 3 and 4 – 6 ) , each containing threefold repeats ( Fig . 11 ) . Its structure in the absence of Ca 2 (cid:2) has been determined at 2 . 5 - Å resolution ( 35 ) . The isolated NH 2 - terminal half can bind to ( cap ) two actin monomers and can sever F - actin without the need for free Ca 2 (cid:2) . In contrast , the COOH - terminal half binds a single actin and is Ca 2 (cid:2) dependent . The molecule is compact and globular having dimensions of (cid:1) 85 (cid:3) 36 (cid:3) 55 Å . Segment 1 cocrystallized with monomeric actin is shown in Figure 12 A . It has two bound Ca 2 (cid:2) ( 186 ) . Gel - solin segments 4 – 6 also bind to monomeric actin , and their relationship to the actin monomer is illustrated in Figure 12 B . McGough et al . ( 181 ) had earlier suggested a mech - anism in which segments 2 and 3 bind to the actin ﬁlament while segment 1 wedges itself between two adjacent actin monomers along the longitudinal axis . This step requires a rearrangement of the interface between segments 1 and 2 to lengthen the linker between these segments . Seg - ments 4 – 6 reach across the ﬁlament to bind a monomer in the other strand . This step would also require extension of the convoluted linker between segments 3 and 4 . The following year , on the basis of crystallographic data , Robinson et al . ( 243 ) concluded that Ca 2 (cid:2) binding induces a conformational rearrangement in which seg - ment 6 is ﬂipped over and translated by (cid:1) 40 Å relative to segments 4 and 5 . The structural reorganization tears apart the continuous (cid:1) - sheet core of segments 4 and 6 . This exposes the actin - binding site on segment 4 , enabling severing and capping of actin ﬁlaments to proceed ( Fig . 13 ) . Severing of F - actin occurs only when sufﬁcient actin - actin bonds are broken ( 36 ) . The severing of F - actin by gelsolin is illustrated in Figure 7 C where only short seg - ments of actin ﬁlaments are observed in the presence of recombinant gelsolin ( electron micrograph courtesy of FIG . 10 .

Coﬁlin accelerates the dissociation of monomers from the pointed ends of ﬁlaments . Phosphorylation of coﬁlin ( dark red ) disso - ciates it from ADP - actin and proﬁlin promotes the exchange of ADP for ATP that facilitates the addition of proﬁlin - ATP - actin at the barbed end . 450 DOS REMEDIOS ET AL .

Here the molar ratio of gelsolin ( seg - ments 1 – 3 ) to actin is 0 . 05 : 1 . The crystal structure of the F - actin binding domain of severin , the gelsolin homolog from Dictyostelium discoi - deum , has recently been described at high ( 1 . 75 Å ) reso - lution ( 243 ) . The structure reveals an (cid:2) - helix - (cid:1) - sheet sandwich that contains two cation - binding sites and F - actin binding residues in the equivalent region of gelsolin segment 2 ( 234 ) . This segment also mediates the binding of gelsolin to tropomyosin ( 172 ) . 2 . Functional properties in vitro A ) ACTIN SEVERING . Gelsolin certainly lives up to its name . It rapidly dissolves actin gels in vitro by severing , capping , and nucleating growth . Like coﬁlin , it can disso - ciate phalloidin from F - actin ( 262 ) . These functions are achieved by attacking ﬁlaments from their barbed ends . Gelsolin is an important ABP because of its high afﬁnity for actin ﬁlaments ( K d 50 nM ) ( 229 ) . Segments 1 – 3 and 4 – 6 of intact gelsolin both play an active role in the severing of F - actin . Binding of gelsolin FIG . 11 .

Segments 4 – 6 confer a Ca 2 (cid:2) sensitivity in the micromolar range , and binding involves a cooperative intramolecular structural rear - rangement within gelsolin ( 229 ) . This can be visualized by comparing the arrangement of segments 4 – 6 of inactive gelsolin ( Fig . 11 ) with the active form shown in Figure 12 B . A cartoon of active gelsolin segments on F - actin is shown in Figure 13 , which was redrawn from a ﬁgure kindly provided by Bob Robinson ( University of Uppsala , Uppsala , Sweden ) . Severing is effective even in the pres - ence of tropomyosin and has been used by several inves - tigators to solubilize actin ﬁlaments from skeletal muscle sarcomeres . B ) CAPPING . Not all authors agree that gelsolin is prin - cipally a severing protein . Gremm and Wegner ( 112 ) ar - gued that at micromolar and submicromolar free Ca 2 (cid:2) concentrations , gelsolin acts more as a Ca 2 (cid:2) - regulated capping protein . They observed that depolymerization was mainly caused by dissociation of actin subunits from the pointed ends of actin ﬁlaments and that inhibition of polymerization was achieved by gelsolin at barbed ends . The rate of capping at the barbed end was directly pro - portional to the free Ca 2 (cid:2) concentration ( 112 ) . After severing , gelsolin remains attached to the barbed end of the ﬁlament as a cap , thereby preventing the reannealing of actin fragments . Capping prevents rapid growth at the barbed ends while disassembly pro - ceeds unchecked at the pointed ends , resulting in the rapid disassembly until an equilibrium is established be - tween capped ﬁlaments and free gelsolin ( 239 ) . Dissocia - tion ( uncapping ) of gelsolin from these ﬁlaments gener - ates numerous polymerization - competent ends that seed the rapid assembly of new ﬁlaments . Thus the cytoskele - ton can be rapidly rebuilt in a new direction and cell movement can be redirected ( 66 ) . C ) CALCIUM DEPENDENCE . Ca 2 (cid:2) is an important cellular trigger for events that involve the cytoskeleton , and gel - solin is also the only known Ca 2 (cid:2) - dependent severing protein with a K d for Ca 2 (cid:2) in the micromolar range . The six motifs contain two sites that bind to G - actin and one that binds to ﬁlaments . The Ca 2 (cid:2) - dependent monomer - binding site in the COOH - terminal half plays a critical role both in the cooperative binding to actin by gelsolin and in its nucleating activity . Actin binding was localized to seg - ment 4 by expressing segments 4 , 4 – 5 , 5 , and 5 – 6 in Escherichia coli ( 232 ) . The nonbinding segments play an important role in the Ca 2 (cid:2) regulation of actin binding and other activities of gelsolin ( 232 ) . The segmental arrange - ments are shown in Figure 10 . An analysis of the gelsolin construct lacking the COOH - terminal helix indicated the importance of this part of molecule for Ca 2 (cid:2) regulation and supported the so - called “tail helix latch” mechanism of activation by Ca 2 (cid:2) ( 170 ) . This latch is primarily responsible for trans - mitting Ca 2 (cid:2) binding from the COOH - terminal half to the NH 2 - terminal half of gelsolin . Occupancy of this site primes gelsolin for severing , but it is unable to sever because the tail latch is still engaged . Unlatching the tail helix by micromolar Ca 2 (cid:2) releases the ﬁnal constraint to initiate the severing cascade ( 163 ) . 3 . Comparison with ADF / cofilin ADF / coﬁlin competes with gelsolin segments 2 and 3 for binding to actin ﬁlaments . This suggests they share a common structural topology for binding to actin ( 290 ) , and this was subsequently conﬁrmed by molecular dy - namics simulation ( 304 ) . Both proteins alter the confor - mation of the actin ﬁlament , dissociate phalloidin , sever , and cap F - actin . They both bind to ADP - G - actin with higher afﬁnity than to ATP - G - actin , and the binding of both to actin is inhibited by PIP 2 ( 275 ) . Recent expression studies suggest both proteins play an important role in regulating actin dynamics in vivo ( 268 ) . However , despite the more powerful severing action of gelsolin , ADF / coﬁlin is currently favored as the major regulatory mechanism of actin cytoskeleton reorganization ( 16 ) . 4 . Knock - out and overexpression Transgenic gelsolin - null mice have normal embry - onic development and longevity but suffer subtle changes suggesting that it is needed for rapid changes in cell motility in hemostasis ( reduced platelet function ) , inﬂam - mation ( delayed neutrophil migration ) , and wound heal - ing ( ﬁbroblasts move more slowly ) ( 303 ) . In these null mice , gelsolin is an essential effector of rac - mediated actin dynamics , acting downstream of rac recruitment to the membrane ( 10 ) . Gelsolin also appears to play a role in the initiation of ﬁlopodial retraction . An absence of gel - solin delays its retraction and produces “studded ” ﬁlopo - dia along growing neurites ( 169 ) .

Con - trol of the rate of cell migration is closely linked to the rates of actin ﬁlament severing . In ﬁbroblasts that over - express gelsolin , there is a direct correlation between movement velocity and actin turnover rates . This demon - strates that gelsolin is an important control mechanism for actin cycling in cells ( 184 ) . Overexpression of gelsolin in cells also inhibits phospholipase C - (cid:3) activity by com - peting with it for available PIP 2 . A rise in free Ca 2 (cid:2) increases the afﬁnity of gelsolin for PIP 2 , and as the level and availability of PIP 2 changes during signaling , cross - talk between PIP 2 - regulated proteins ( e . g . , gelsolin and phospholipase C - (cid:3) ) provides a mechanism for positive or negative regulation of the signal transduction cascade ( 274 ) . D . Thymosins Thymosin (cid:1) 4 ( T (cid:1) 4 ) is a small ( molecular mass (cid:1) 5 kDa ) protein that belongs to a family of highly conserved small proteins originally isolated from the thymus gland but now known to be more widely distributed ( 93 ) . It contains 43 residues , (cid:1) 50 % of which are charged . The amino acid composition of T (cid:1) 4 is remarkably deﬁcient in hydrophobic residues ( 168 ) , which suggests that T (cid:1) 4 probably has very little deﬁned structure in solution . 1 . Structure Until very recently , the structure of T (cid:1) 4 was based on a model constructed by Dan Safer et al . ( 251 ) who docked it to the crystal structure of monomeric actin solved in the presence of DNase I ( Fig . 14 ) . These authors regard this protein as having an essentially unfolded con - formation in solution and , although there may be an in - crease in its (cid:2) - helical content , it remains unfolded once it binds to actin ( 251 ) . Based on a range of data ( 250 ) , it has been suggested that T (cid:1) 4 drapes itself around nearly half the perimeter of the actin . The molecular contact points between T (cid:1) 4 and the actin monomer investigated using zero - length cross - linkers show that Lys - 3 of T (cid:1) 4 is located close to Glu - 167 ( in subdomain 3 near the hinge ) , and that Lys - 18 of T (cid:1) 4 cross - links to one of the four NH 2 - terminal acidic residues of actin ( Asp - 1 through Glu - 4 ) . These two contacts ﬂank the (cid:2) - helical region of T (cid:1) 4 at the barbed end of the monomer . The COOH - terminal region of T (cid:1) 4 ( Lys - 38 ) was cross - linked to Gln - 41 at the top of actin subdomain 2 , a known DNase I binding site . The NMR structure of free T (cid:1) 4 in solution ( 75 ) ex - hibits a range of conformational preferences . In water it appears to lack a folded conformation , but a preferential (cid:2) - helical conformation can be observed in solution at different temperatures and pH . Residues 5 – 16 putatively bind to the NH 2 - terminal region of actin and have char - acteristic temperature - dependent conformations ( 75 ) . These data indicate that many parts of T (cid:1) 4 are not in tight contact with actin . Similarly , circular dichroism spectra indicate that free T (cid:1) 4 is predominantly unstructured but increases its (cid:2) - helical content when it binds to actin . At least one research group has made progress with a crystal structure of T (cid:1) 4 . De La Cruz et al . ( 78 ) recently concluded that T (cid:1) 4 changes the conformation and structural dynam - ics ( the so - called “breathing” ) of actin monomers . The conformational change may reﬂect the unique ability of T (cid:1) 4 to sequester actin monomers and inhibit nucleotide exchange ( compared with proﬁlin ) . 2 . Cellular distribution and functions (cid:1) - Thymosins are widely distributed in nature . Trans - lational levels can vary from tissue to tissue ( 262 ) . In chick brain , concentrations are an order of magnitude higher than proﬁlin and coﬁlin . It is abundant in neural tissue as well as in circulating cells such as platelets , leukocytes , and macrophages . T (cid:1) 4 binds stoichiometri - cally to monomeric actin and inhibits polymerization . In the developing chick brain , the ratio of ADF to coﬁlin to T (cid:1) 4 increases between embryonic days 13 and 17 . Be - cause no other thymosin isoforms were detected in brain extracts , it is probable that it is the major actin - seques - tering protein in this tissue ( 84 ) . T (cid:1) 4 mRNA is mainly expressed in neurons of the hippocampus , neocortex , and the amygdala , as well as in oligodendrocytes and probably has a function in the production and remodeling of neu - FIG . 14 . A modeled complex of thymosin (cid:1) 4 and an actin monomer ( 78 ) using an orientation of the actin monomer comparable to Figs . 5 A , 9 A , and 12 .

T (cid:1) 4 is upregulated in the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus where its function may be related to restoration of neurite circuits after focal isch - emic damage ( 292 ) . T (cid:1) 4 is present in some cells at concentrations as high as 0 . 5 mM ( 249 ) . High expression levels have been ob - served in young embryonic muscles but not in adult skel - etal muscles . Consequently , it seems that the G - actin pool in young embryonic skeletal muscle is mainly regulated by T (cid:1) 4 and proﬁlin ( 206 ) . However , T (cid:1) 4 may become less important as muscle develops ( 199 ) . In contrast , there is evidence that it plays a role in angiogenesis in coronary smooth muscle , acting as a chemoattractant by stimulat - ing the migration of endothelial cells in vivo ( 174 ) . In quiescent NIH 3T3 cells , T (cid:1) 4 was undetectable , but after restoring serum to the culture medium where cells were induced to proliferate , there was a pronounced increase in T (cid:1) 4 mRNA ( 316 ) . Overexpression in these cells increases F - actin levels while maintaining a constant level of total actin ( 273 ) . In contrast , others reported that a twofold increase in T (cid:1) 4 in these same cells doubled the total actin expression but maintained the ratio of G - to F - actin ( 110 ) . Unexpectedly , other cytoskeletal proteins such myosin IIA , (cid:2) - actinin , and tropomyosin also in - creased nearly twofold ( 273 ) . The T (cid:1) 4 cell lines spread more fully and adhered to the dish more strongly than vector controls , suggesting a coordinated regulation of the cytoskeleton by T (cid:1) 4 . In addition , transcriptional lev - els of several related cytoskeletal proteins also increased . These observations suggest there is a coordinated cy - toskeletal expression of this protein ( 110 ) . Like several other ABPs , thymosins bind to and co - ordinately control the availability of actin monomers for incorporation into ﬁlaments . T (cid:1) 4 is a contender with proﬁlin for the title of the universal actin - monomer bind - ing protein . It has a putative actin - binding motif ( LKHAET ) ( 287 ) found in other ABPs including acto - bindin and myosin . Nachmias ( 196 ) , and more recently Chen et al . ( 54 ) , reviewed the discovery and primary structure of T (cid:1) 4 . Acting alone , T (cid:1) 4 inhibits polymerization , and like ADF / coﬁlin it also inhibits the exchange of the actin - bound nucleotide ( 107 ) . This contrasts with the action of proﬁlin which , acting alone , facilitates the exchange of ADP for ATP and promotes actin assembly ( 109 ) . Thus , while it acts as a passive buffer of actin monomers , pre - venting their polymerization , T (cid:1) 4 can cooperate with pro - ﬁlin to regulate actin assembly ( 273 ) . However , T (cid:1) 4 is not a simple G - actin - sequestering protein because , at least at high concentrations , it also interacts with F - actin ( 40 ) . The actin - binding sites of T (cid:1) 4 resemble that of an - other small ABP , actobindin , which also inhibits polymer - ization . Their binding loci on monomeric actin have been localized using peptide mimetics ( 286 ) . Both have an NH 2 - terminal hexapeptide motif forming the major elec - trostatic contact site with actin . A nonconserved NH 2 - terminal segment preceding the motif exerts an inhibitory activity on actin polymerization probably by steric hin - drance . Substitution of a His or Lys for a Glu at the third position in the motif converts the peptide from an inhib - itor of polymerization into a stimulator . Thus subtle se - quence changes in ABPs can have remarkable effects on their functions . 3 . Molecular interaction with actin Binding of T (cid:1) 4 to actin is coupled to the dissociation of bound water molecules , which is greater for CaATP - actin than MgATP - actin monomers . The COOH terminus of T (cid:1) 4 makes contact with actin at His - 40 near the mouth of the nucleotide cleft and binding slows the 3 H exchange rate , suggesting there are changes in conformation of actin monomers when it binds . This may reﬂect the ability of T (cid:1) 4 to both sequester actin monomers and inhibit nucleotide exchange ( 78 ) . Gelsolin and T (cid:1) 4 compete for binding to actin , indi - cating that T (cid:1) 4 binds to a site close or identical to the gelsolin segment 1 - binding site ( 13 ) . Figure 6 shows that the binding loci for gelsolin and T (cid:1) 4 do not precisely coincide but that there must be sufﬁcient overlap to ex - plain the competition . If T (cid:1) 4 is to be a major cellular actin - sequestering factor , it should bind , among other things , with a slightly higher afﬁnity ( 0 . 7 (cid:4) M ) than gelsolin ( (cid:1) 1 (cid:4) M ) ( 262 ) , thus subtly shifting the assembly / disas - sembly equilibrium of actin toward the monomeric state . The interactions of these two proteins with actin are complex and require the participation of several comple - mentary peptide sequences . A common motif ( I , V ) EKFD in these two proteins exerts a major inhibitory effect on salt - induced actin polymerization ( 96 ) . To make matters more complex , T (cid:1) 4 and proﬁlin ( and presumably gelsolin ) compete with WASP ( an acti - vator of Arp2 / 3 ) for binding to actin monomers and pre - sumably have overlapping binding sites ( see sect . III G ) . DNase I and T (cid:1) 4 bind to sites on actin that partially overlap . The apparent K d of the actin - T (cid:1) 4 complex gen - erated from a preformed actin - DNase I complex is 160 (cid:4) M . A ﬁvefold excess of DNase I over the preformed actin - T (cid:1) 4 complex is necessary to observe a comparable K d ( 129 ) . Thus DNase I can displace T (cid:1) 4 from the mono - mer ( and probably vice versa ) . Chemical cross - linking experiments also indicate that proﬁlin competes with T (cid:1) 4 for actin binding . In the presence of Mg 2 (cid:2) , proﬁlin promotes assembly of T (cid:1) 4 - actin but in the presence of Ca 2 (cid:2) , proﬁlin was unable to initiate this polymerization ( 12 ) . Phalloidin , rabbit skele - tal muscle myosin S1 , and chicken intestinal myosin I all polymerize actin from the T (cid:1) 4 - actin complex ( 15 ) . Thus , despite the very high afﬁnity of DNase I for actin , its binding can be inhibited by a lower afﬁnity T (cid:1) 4 . The 454 DOS REMEDIOS ET AL .

Competitive binding data suggest that T (cid:1) 4 also makes contact with the myosin binding site as well as with the bottom of subdomain 3 where it overlaps the binding sites of several ABPs including DBP ( Fig . 6 , row 3 ) at the barbed end of the monomer . Therefore , the distance between the pointed and barbed ends requires the COOH - terminal half of T (cid:1) 4 to be in a predominantly extended conformation ( 247 ) . Point mutations revealed that the middle section of T (cid:1) 4 ( residues 17 – 22 ) also in - teracts with actin ( 267 ) . Although T (cid:1) 4 is widely recognized as a monomer binding protein , at least three reports have demonstrated its ability to bind to F - actin ( 14 , 40 , 273 ) . Addition of 200 (cid:4) M T (cid:1) 4 during actin assembly decreases the critical con - centration of free actin . This is consistent with the in vivo observation that overexpression of T (cid:1) 4 increases stress ﬁbers and decreases the amount of monomeric actin ( 273 ) . A chemically cross - linked binary complex of T (cid:1) 4 actin is incorporated into F - actin only when both phalloi - din and gelsolin are present ( 14 ) . T (cid:1) 4 increases the long - pitch helical repeat ( from 35 to 40 . 5 nm determined from 3 - dimensional helical reconstructions ) of F - actin . Like its interaction with actin monomers , T (cid:1) 4 does not “dock” neatly onto the F - actin model , particularly at the NH 2 - terminal region of actin subdomain 3 . This difference may well be due to conformational changes in both proteins as suggested recently by at least two authors ( 14 , 78 ) . 4 . Other thymosins Thymosin isoforms are distributed throughout the vertebrate phyla ( 247 ) . While T (cid:1) 4 is the predominant expressed isoform in mammalian cells , many species pro - duce at least two T (cid:1) isoforms , in some cases in the same cell ( 49 ) . Differences in the distributions of the mRNAs encoding T (cid:1) 10 and T (cid:1) 4 suggest there are different roles for these peptides during mouse early embryogenesis ( 49 ) . The levels of T (cid:1) 10 mRNA strongly increase during early postimplantation mouse embryogenesis , suggesting that T (cid:1) 10 plays an important role in early development . Changes in T (cid:1) 10 and T (cid:1) 4 mRNA expression are also important in the control of actin dynamics in developed neurons and glia since T (cid:1) 10 mRNA is present in different regions of the rat forebrain , including hippocampus , neo - cortex , and several brain nuclei ( 48 ) . T (cid:1) 10 is also down - regulated in failing human hearts with dilated cardiomy - opathy ( Tsubakihara , unpublished data ) . The underlying mechanism for these cellular changes remains to be elucidated . However , plasmid - driven over - expression of the T (cid:1) 10 gene is known to increase the susceptibility of apoptosis in transfected ﬁbroblasts ( 115 ) . These proapoptotic properties of thymosins may be me - diated by G - actin sequestering and involve interaction with DNase I ( 114 ) . NIH 3T3 cells that overexpress ( x3 ) T (cid:1) 10 have been shown to have 23 – 33 % more polymerized actin than con - trol cells , and their microﬁlaments appear thicker . There is no change in total actin , proﬁlin , or coﬁlin / ADF content . These cells are more motile , spread faster , and have higher chemotactic and wound healing activity ( 273 ) . Im - munoﬂuorescent labeling of peritoneal macrophages showed that both T (cid:1) 4 and T (cid:1) 10 were uniformly distrib - uted within the cytoplasm . Overexpression in ﬁbroblasts induces extensive loss of stress ﬁbers , indicating that T (cid:1) 4 and T (cid:1) 10 are functionally similar and that both are effective regulators of actin ﬁlament dynamics in living cells ( 313 ) . Both T (cid:1) 4 and T (cid:1) 10 are elevated in a human prostate cancer cell line and correlate positively with the grade of tumor . Transfection with antisense T (cid:1) 15 constructs into rat prostatic carcinoma cells demonstrates that the T (cid:1) 4 peptide positively regulates cell motility . Increased motil - ity is a critical component of the metastatic pathway ( 22 ) . T (cid:1) 15 is also upregulated in nonmetastatic breast cancer and even in ductal carcinoma ( compared with benign breast tissue ) . Consequently , it might represent a poten - tial early marker for breast malignancy ( 106 ) . T (cid:1) 9 and T (cid:1) met9 ( the minor variants of T (cid:1) 4 ) inhibit polymerization of ATP - actin with identical K d values ( 0 . 7 – 0 . 8 (cid:4) M ) . Like T (cid:1) 4 , these thymosins bind to ADP - G - actin with a 100 - fold lower afﬁnity than to ATP - G - actin ( 134 ) . E . DNase I DNase I is a secretory glycoprotein with an endonu - clease activity that cleaves double - stranded DNA to yield 5 (cid:7) - phosphorylated polynucleotides . It has a requirement for both Ca 2 (cid:2) and Mg 2 (cid:2) . Bovine pancreatic DNase I is the best characterized of a group of DNases . It has a molec - ular mass of 31 kDa and an optimum pH of 7 . 8 ( 152 ) . It was ﬁrst puriﬁed from pancreas and parotid gland that contained four DNases ( A , B , C , and D ) , differing accord - ing to their carbohydrate side chain and polypeptide com - ponents . DNase I is glycosylated at Asn - 18 ( 189 ) . These factors , together with the presence of sialic acid , result in a charge heterogeneity that can be detected by isoelectric focusing ( 162 ) . 1 . Atomic structure The structure of DNase I was solved crystallographi - cally ( 272 ) at 2 - Å resolution and was found to have two Ca 2 (cid:2) binding sites . DNase I has a high afﬁnity for actin ( K d (cid:6) 5 (cid:3) 10 8 M (cid:4) 1 ) ( 177 ) . The crystal structure of the actin - DNase I complex ( with actin in the ATP form ) has been determined at 2 . 8 - Å resolution ( 137 ) . Most ABPs interact with actin subdomain I , whereas DNase I binds to ACTIN AND ACTIN BINDING PROTEINS 455 Physiol Rev • VOL 83 • APRIL 2003 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on O c t obe r 26 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m the part corresponding to the pointed end of the actin ( 298 ) . The atomic structure of rabbit skeletal muscle actin complexed with bovine DNase I is shown in Figure 15 . 2 . Cellular functions DNase I is an enzyme secreted by exocrine glands such as the pancreas and the parotid into the alimentary tract . However , it has a much wider tissue distribution . This suggests it may play roles other than to hydrolyze DNA . DNase I , as well as other DNases , has been impli - cated in apoptosis ( 223 ) where it hydrolyzes DNA into short fragments ( DNA laddering ) . Lazarides and Lindberg ( 159 ) discovered that actin was a naturally occurring inhibitor of DNase I , and they were the ﬁrst to suggest that DNase I may be a cytoskel - etal protein . They proposed three possible biological roles for this interaction : 1 ) actin controls the nucleolytic ac - tivity of this enzyme during the cell cycle , 2 ) the complex has a speciﬁc function in DNA metabolism , and 3 ) the primary function of DNase I is related to the formation and function of actin ﬁlaments rather than to the degra - dation of DNA . The fact that phosphoinositides can dis - sociate the binary actin - DNase I complex ( 309 ) also sug - gests that this interaction may have biological relevance . DNase I has been useful tool in measuring G - actin levels in cells ( 71 ) , although its function in cytoskeletal dynamics is yet to be elucidated . However , the tight bind - ing and speciﬁcity of DNase I for actin and its wide distribution suggests it has a biological role . It binds very tightly to G - actin ( K d in the nM range ) ( 266 ) and essen - tially removes all free actin monomers from solution . It binds much more weakly to F - actin ( 100 (cid:4) M ) where it is a capping protein that increases the rate of dissociation from the pointed ends of ﬁlaments ( 298 ) . We recently examined the possible cellular codistri - bution of DNase I and coﬁlin in cultured mammalian cells . Using ﬂuorescent - labeled antibodies to coﬁlin and DNase I , we found the cytoplasmic distributions of these two proteins overlap but are not identical ( 56 ) . Like T (cid:1) 4 , DNase I may act as a stabilizer of actin monomers by effectively removing them from the available pool of monomers available for assembly . In section IV we raise the possibility that it may also be a natural modulator of the action of coﬁlin on the cytoskeleton . F . Capping Proteins Monomers in actin ﬁlaments “age” as they progress from the assembling ( barbed ) end to the disassembling ( pointed ) end of a ﬁlament . This aging process is driven by the chemical energy of Mg - ATP . Free monomers pre - dominantly contain bound ATP that is hydrolyzed to ADP - P i only after incorporation at the barbed end , with the subsequent release of P i . At the barbed end , the on rate for ATP monomers ( 5 (cid:4) M / s ) exceeds the off rate ( 1 (cid:4) M / s ) while for ADP monomers the corresponding on rate ( 1 (cid:4) M / s ) is slower than the off rate ( 6 (cid:4) M / s ) . Thus , while monomers at the barbed end nearly all contain ATP , monomers at the pointed end mostly contain ADP . At the pointed end , the on rate for ATP monomers ( 0 . 5 (cid:4) M / s ) is slower than its off rate ( 1 (cid:4) M / s ) while the off rate for ADP ( 0 . 2 (cid:4) M / s ) is faster than its on rate ( 0 . 1 (cid:4) M / s ) ( 149 ) . Because the rates of monomer exchange are 20 times faster at the barbed than at the pointed end , there is a high probability that an ATP monomer that adds to this end will be hydrolyzed before another exchange occurs . Clearly , capping proteins at these ends will alter mono - mer kinetics depending on their binding afﬁnity and rate of exchange . Many , perhaps most , cells control the length and number distribution of thin ﬁlaments under conditions where total actin concentration remains approximately constant . This assembly and disassembly of actin requires a dynamic equilibrium between actin monomers and the two , nonequivalent ends of actin ﬁlaments . Proteins that cap or prevent this exchange may variously nucleate , promote , stabilize , or inhibit assembly . They are therefore in a strong position to regulate actin polymerization . This simple concept is illustrated in Figure 16 . Here we focus FIG . 15 . This ribbon structure of DNase I ( red ) and actin is derived from the 1990 2 . 8 - Å crystal structure of the complex ( 137 ) . The orien - tation is essentially the same as Figs . 5 A , 9 A , 12 , and 14 . Note the contacts for DNase I are located in subdomain 2 . 456 DOS REMEDIOS ET AL .

CapZ , a barbed - end capping protein Several different proteins can bind to the barbed end of ﬁlaments . Some of them like gelsolin ( and its close relatives adseverin and fragmin ) ( 254 ) and proﬁlin have already been discussed above in a different context . Villin , CapG , tensin , and fragmin have been reviewed else - where ( 254 ) . CapZ is present in all eukaryotic cells ( 65 ) . In skeletal muscle it is localized at the Z - disk where it is probably held onto the Z - ﬁlaments by a unique protein ( see review in Ref . 165 ) . It is usually prepared from chicken or rabbit skeletal muscle but , unless G - actin is twice puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration , traces of CapZ remain in the preparation and affect actin assembly characteristics ( 52 ) . The difﬁculty in preparing actin free of CapZ can be appreciated when one realizes that one heterodimer of CapZ can cap a ﬁlament containing a thousand or more actin monomers ( 265 ) . A ) FUNCTIONS OF C AP Z . The reported biological roles of CapZ are as follows : 1 ) nucleation of actin assembly , 2 ) capture of preexisting ﬁlaments , 3 ) regulation of actin assembly at the barbed ends of ﬁlaments , 4 ) elimination of annealing at the barbed ends of ﬁlaments ( 265 ) , and 5 ) correct assembly of ﬁlaments at the Z - disk ( 254 ) . CapZ does not affect the rate of fragmentation of actin ﬁlaments and does not bind to their pointed ends ( 53 ) . Figure 16 shows CapZ at the barbed end of a ﬁlament . CapZ is a heterodimer comprising an (cid:2) - subunit ( there are at least 2 isoforms in eukaryotic cells ) and a (cid:1) - subunit ( 2 or 3 isoforms ) , and both subunits are re - quired for effective barbed - end capping of ﬁlaments ( 53 ) . The (cid:2) 1 - and (cid:2) 2 - isoforms result from alternative gene ex - pression ( 117 ) . Capping proteins containing the (cid:2) 1 - iso - form display fourfold higher afﬁnity for actin than capping protein containing the (cid:2) 2 - isoform , although the physiolog - ical signiﬁcance of this remains unclear . The (cid:1) 1 - and (cid:1) 2 - isoforms result from alternative splicing of a single mRNA transcript ( 255 ) , and although both isoforms dem - onstrate similar afﬁnity for actin , they are differentially expressed and distributed . The (cid:1) 1 - isoform is predomi - nantly expressed in muscle cells and is localized to the Z - line in striated muscle , whereas the (cid:1) 2 is located under the sarcolemma ( 51 ) . Consequently , capping protein con - taining the (cid:1) 1 - isoform is often referred to as CapZ and is analogous to (cid:1) - actinin ( 179 ) . The (cid:1) 2 - isoform is predomi - nantly expressed in nonmuscle cells where it is localized to the cell periphery ( 255 ) . B ) STRUCTURE OF C AP Z . CapZ was recently crystallized by Yuchiro Maeda and colleagues , and a preliminary re - port was presented at the SPring8 actin conference held in Japan in November 2001 . Details of this structure are not yet available but are likely to be published later in 2003 . Despite the fact there are no cocrystals of CapZ - actin , considerable detail is available on the molecular contacts between these proteins . The contact sites on actin are illustrated in Figure 6 , row 4 . Deletion of the COOH terminus of the (cid:1) - subunit of CapZ eliminates its capping activity as does the binding of a monoclonal antibody directed against the COOH - terminal 12 residues ( 130 ) . Later , this same group showed that 31 – 40 % , respec - tively , of the (cid:2) - and (cid:1) - subunits are not required for strong binding to actin , suggesting that these regions may be important for other functions ( 53 ) . As its name suggests , capping protein binds tightly to the barbed end of actin ﬁlaments . In vitro , this capping prevents the exchange of actin subunits from the barbed end . Furthermore , capping protein facilitates actin poly - merization by binding to and stabilizing monomers or oligomers of actin forming nuclei for elongation of ﬁla - ments ( 51 ) . C ) REGULATION OF C AP Z ACTIVITY . In vivo , the capping of actin ﬁlaments is regulated by second messengers , PIP and PIP 2 . This is also true for other ABPs including coﬁlin , destrin and DNase I ( 309 ) , proﬁlin ( 108 ) , and gelsolin ( 285 ) ( see Table 1 ) . Upon signal transduction , PIP and PIP 2 promote removal of capping protein from actin ﬁla - FIG . 16 . A cartoon representation of the interaction of a barbed - end ( CapZ , purple ) and a pointed - end capping protein , tropomodulin ( brown ) ( Tmod ) . One CapZ binds to two monomers at the barbed end of an actin ( yellow ) ﬁlament . The NH 2 terminus of Tmod binds tightly to NH 2 terminus of tropomyosin ( green ) at the pointed end of ﬁlaments and also to one ( or two ) monomers . The on rate and off rates at the ﬁlament ends are indicated by lengths of the arrows . Two views of the Tmod molecule [ originally published in Krieger et al . ( 153 ) ] , modeled from X - ray scattering data , are shown at the top of this ﬁgure .

This allows actin polymerization to proceed in localized re - gions of the cell . Capping protein is involved in a variety of biological roles including the activation of platelets and maintaining the proper assembly of actin ﬁlaments at the Z - line of sarcomere ( 254 ) . 2 . Tropomodulin , a pointed - end capping protein Unlike barbed - end capping proteins , pointed - end capping proteins are something of a rarity . The name tropomodulin ( Tmod ) is apt because it binds strongly to actin in the presence of tropomyosin . With the exception of Arp2 / 3 ( see sect . III G ) , no other protein binds to the pointed end of F - actin , and no other protein inhibits ﬁla - ment elongation at this end . Although Tmod binds to F - actin ( it does not bind monomeric actin ) . Its afﬁnity is weak ( K d (cid:1) 0 . 1 (cid:4) M ) compared with its afﬁnity for tropo - myosin - decorated actin ﬁlaments that is about three or - ders of magnitude stronger ( K d is submicromolar ) ( 297 ) . For this reason , some authors originally referred to it as a tropomyosin binding protein ( 295 ) . Human Tmod has been cloned and is expressed in a wide range of tissues with high levels in skeletal and cardiac muscle ( 276 ) . It contains 359 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 40 , 476 Da determined by mass spec - trometry . Overexpression of Tmod in cardiomyocytes produces short , disorganized , and destabilized thin ﬁla - ments ( 277 ) . A Tmod overexpressing transgenic mouse is now available ( 278 ) . A related , somewhat large ( 64 kDa ) protein , leiomodin , is highly expressed in smooth as well as cardiac and skeletal muscle ( 62 ) . Yuichiro Maeda’s group ( at the RIKEN SPring8 Insti - tute , Japan ) has reported crystals of the actin - binding COOH - terminal half of Tmod that diffract to 1 . 45 Å ( 153 ) . This structure is now in press in the Biophysical Journal . The overall shape of a slightly truncated Tmod has been determined from low - angle X - ray scattering by Fujisawa et al . ( 101 ) , also in Maeda’s group . Tmod is 115 Å long and consists of two domains , one 65 Å long , the other slightly smaller , where the long axes of the two are tilted by (cid:1) 40° relative to each other and is illustrated in Figure 16 . The authors proposed a model for Tmod in which the rod - shaped NH 2 - terminal half binds to the NH 2 terminus of tropomyosin , and the COOH - terminal region protrudes from the pointed end of the actin ﬁlament and is slightly bent toward the actin subunit at the end , capping the pointed end ( 101 ) . There appears to be 1 – 2 Tmod mole - cules / actin ﬁlament ( 98 ) . Both CapZ and Tmod can regulate ﬁlament length and assembly in vitro and in vivo . By studying the incor - poration of rhodamine - labeled actin monomers into na - tive thin ﬁlaments of cardiomyocytes , Littleﬁeld et al . ( 164 ) concluded that both proteins can rapidly exchange , i . e . , at their respective ends . Blocking barbed ends with cytochalasin D had no effect on ﬁlament length , whereas overexpression of Tmod reduced actin ﬁlament length , possibly because Tmod promotes the conversion of ATP or ADP - P i monomers to ADP with a consequent raising of the critical concentration from 0 . 1 to 1 . 0 (cid:4) M ( 241 ) . G . The Arp2 / 3 Complex Arp2 and Arp3 belong to a recently discovered family of proteins that are related , at least in a limited way , to the sequence and structure of actin . Their cellular concentra - tions are 2 and 5 (cid:4) M , respectively ( 171 ) . These two actin - like proteins are assembled into the Arp2 / 3 complex , which is known to occur in a wide range of organisms from yeast to mammals . The seven - subunit protein com - plex comprises Arp2 and Arp3 and ﬁve smaller ( Arc ) proteins that do not appear to be related to any proteins currently in the databases . Both Arp2 and Arp3 sequences have nucleotide - binding and divalent cation - binding re - gions , but otherwise they are divergent from each other and from actin ( 143 ) . Arp2 / 3 is associated with dynamic cortical regions of mammalian cells that are rich in cy - toskeletal actin ( 69 ) . It colocalizes with the actin “comet tails” of Listeria and Shigella where actin polymerization drives ﬁlament assembly and propels these intracellular bacterial pathogens through the cytoplasm of the host cell at speeds of 10 – 90 (cid:4) m / min ( 302 ) . 1 . Structure The structure of the Arp2 / 3 complex at 2 . 0 - Å resolu - tion was only recently described ( 244 ) . It is remarkable that a complex this big crystallized at all . Proteins were extracted from bovine thymus gland , and the isolated complex was in an inactive state when it was crystallized . Conversion to an active form is a matter of speculation but will probably involve a rearrangement of several sub - units to allow the Arp2 and Arp3 to be repositioned so that they can act as nucleation site for the assembly of new ﬁlaments . This rearrangement will also be needed if the Arp2 / 3 complex is to “capture” preexisting ﬁlaments and incorporate them with the correct orientation toward the advancing cell membrane . The structure is now de - posited in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB accession number 1k8k ) . Brieﬂy , the structure has the following features . The overall shape of the complex is a ﬂat ellipsoid with di - mensions of 150 (cid:3) 140 (cid:3) 70 – 100 Å . The structures of Arp2 and Arp3 strongly resemble the actin monomer . Arp2 has a strong resemblance to subdomains 1 and 2 of actin except that the interdomain cleft is more open ( by (cid:1) 18° ) and contains no bound ATP . It also has a proﬁlin binding domain ( 143 ) . Arp3 contains large inserts into subdo - mains 2 , 3 , and 4 and has 42 residues more than actin . The 458 DOS REMEDIOS ET AL .

Subdomains 1 and 2 were difﬁcult to resolve in the crystals , and the authors replaced them with a poly - alanine backbone . These and other features give the Arps distinctive surface features . In mammalian cells , the ﬁve associated proteins are p16 , p20 , p21 , p34 , and p40 ( pro - teins are also called ARPC - 5 , - 4 , - 3 , - 2 , and - 1 , respectively ) of which the last is a seven - blade propeller structure with a large insert that may be responsible , along with p20 and p21 , for anchoring the complex to the side of the actin ﬁlament . p20 and p34 are located in the center of the structure and may move as a block relative to Arp2 ( 244 ) . 2 . Cellular functions The principal function of Arp2 / 3 is to create branch points by nucleating the assembly of ﬁlaments near ruf - ﬂing membranes , a process that needs micromolar con - centrations of ATP ( 195 ) . Arp2 / 3 is also considered to be a cross - linking protein , and some authors believe it can cap the pointed ( depolymerizing ) ends of actin ﬁlaments , although this is still controversial . Nucleation of ﬁlament assembly by Arp2 / 3 , ﬁrst ob - served by Welch et al . ( 302 ) , is unlike any other ABP . Extracellular signals such as growth factors are transmit - ted through G protein - coupled receptors ( e . g . , Cdc42 ) to Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) , the neuronal homolog of WASP ( N - WASP ) , or suppressor of cAMP receptor 1 ( Scar1 ) . PIP 2 may be also involved in the activation of WASP ( 242 ) . Activated WASP has sites that bind both an actin monomer and the Arp2 / 3 complex . Arp2 / 3 then changes its conformation so that it can nu - cleate the assembly of new actin ﬁlaments and assemble a “daughter ” ﬁlament at an angle of (cid:1) 70° to the “mother” ﬁlament ( Fig . 17 ) . As a consequence , Arp2 / 3 is localized at branch points in the cortical ﬁlament network , binding the pointed end of a new ( uncapped ) daughter ﬁlament to the mother ﬁlament thus leaving the barbed ( growing ) end available for ﬁlament elongation . It is not clear at this stage whether WASP dissociates from activated Arp2 / 3 at the branch point . Zalevsky et al . ( 314 ) recently examined how N - WASP and Scar1 differentially activate the Arp2 / 3 complex to produce actin networks with different three - dimensional architectures . They found that nucleation was slowest for Scar1 , 16 - fold higher for WASP , and 70 - fold higher still for the neuronal analog N - WASP . Their data ﬁt a mathemat - ical model in which one activated Arp2 / 3 complex , one actin monomer , and an actin ﬁlament combine into a preactivation complex . This then undergoes a ﬁrst - order activation step to become a nucleus . They went on to FIG . 17 . A cartoon of the molecular interactions Arp2 / 3 . Components are as follows : activated Arp2 / 3 ( red ) , inactive Arp2 / 3 ( pink ) , N - WASP ( green ) , Cdc42 ( blue ) , phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) ( yellow ) , and actin ( orange ) . Inactive Arp2 / 3 is activated by N - WASP under the control of Cdc42 and PIP 2 , and ﬁlament formation is nucleated . Actin ﬁlaments assemble by addition of monomers at the barbed end . The N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 complex can bind to the side of the “mother” ﬁlament to create a branch point that also polymerizes . This branching assembly creates an “out - pushing” of the cell membrane . The branching of “daughter ” ﬁlaments occurs at an angle of 70° to the mother ﬁlament . The solid black arrows indicate the directions of the polymerization forces . ACTIN AND ACTIN BINDING PROTEINS 459 Physiol Rev • VOL 83 • APRIL 2003 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on O c t obe r 26 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m show that WASP and Scar1 bind actin and Arp2 / 3 with nearly identical afﬁnities but stimulate rates of actin nu - cleation that vary by almost 100 - fold . Differences in nu - cleation rates were attributed to differences in the num - ber of COOH - terminal acidic amino acids that are respon - sible for different rates of actin assembly . The authors therefore concluded that Arp2 / 3 is not regulated by a simple on - off switch . In the vicinity of the rufﬂing membrane , new mono - mers are added to the barbed - end of the growing ﬁlament creating a polymerization - based “out - pushing” of the cell membrane ( Fig . 17 ) . The Y - shaped branch points produce a cross - linked meshwork of ﬁlaments that act as a plat - form against which the actin polymerization can push . The entire Arp2 / 3 complex along with WASP have been observed in electron microscopic images of branching ﬁlaments ( 293 ) . Mullins et al . ( 195 ) refer to this process of branching ﬁlaments as “dendritic nucleation . ” Assembly of monomers at the barbed ends of these ﬁlaments gen - erates the force needed to push the rufﬂing membrane forward . Branching may occur at the barbed ends or along the side of the mother ﬁlament ( or both ) . Ishiwata and co - workers ( 103 ) recently addressed this question by the directly visualizing actin assembly using total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy . In the presence of Arp2 / 3 and N - WASP , branching occurred predominantly along the sides of growing ﬁlaments . Nucleation and branching are carried out close to the leading edge of motile cells . Arp2 / 3 is not generally asso - ciated with ﬁlaments deeper into the cortex of the cell where the actin ﬁlaments are known to bind tropomyosin . A recent report ( 28 ) demonstrated that tropomyosin lo - cated deeper into the cytoplasmic cortex inhibits branch - ing and nucleation by WASP - activated Arp2 / 3 , thus re - stricting its distribution to the cytoplasmic perimeter . In Listeria , nucleation of new ﬁlaments occurs in response to the expression of ActA that mimics the func - tion of WASP in recruiting Arp2 / 3 . ActA contains 612 amino acids and is anchored into the bacterial membrane . In a fascinating series of experiments , Cameron et al . ( 39 ) showed that small microspheres coated with puriﬁed ActA could undergo movement generated by actin poly - merization . Thus ActA alone can nucleate actin assembly . The minimum set of proteins and conditions needed for actin - based motility was recently deﬁned for the propul - sion of Listeria by Marie - France Carlier and colleagues ( 166 ) . ATP , Arp2 / 3 , actin ﬁlaments with bound ADP , ADF / coﬁlin , and a capping protein ( e . g . , CapZ ) were all that was required . ADF / coﬁlin accelerates the treadmilling of monomers through the ﬁlaments ( see above ) and drives the Listeria through the actin - rich cytoplasm of its host cell . A review from this group ( 220 ) highlighted the com - plexity of the mechanism of actin assembly in cell biol - ogy . Clearly other intracellular factors such as proﬁlin and (cid:2) - actinin regulate the rates of actin assembly in these “comet tails” ( the review by Pantaloni et al . is available at www . sciencemag . org / cgi / content / full / 292 / 5521 / 1502 / DC1 ) . The role of WASP / Scar proteins is critical for cyto - plasmic organization in a range of organs during develop - ment in Drosophila ( 315 ) and presumably Arp2 / 3 and the WASP family of proteins play essential roles in the devel - opment of mammalian cells . Several reviews have recently been published on the role of Arp2 / 3 in actin polymerization and the factors that control the functions of Arp2 / 3 . These include the role of WASP family of proteins ( 50 , 125 , 242 ) , and a review of the structure of Arp2 / 3 itself ( 31 ) . Thus Arp2 / 3 is a complex protein with an even more complicated method of activation . Single - headed myosin I motor proteins interact with Arp2 / 3 via their Scar - homol - ogy 3 ( SH3 ) domain ( 160 ) , but what are motor protein doing in a process that is usually regarded as an actin - only process ? Certainly there is no evidence to suggest that Arp2 / 3 is involved in muscle contraction , although it clearly plays a role in actin - based motility . Several other questions remain . What is the nature of the conformational changes needed to activate Arp2 / 3 ? Can Arp2 / 3 promote ﬁlament growth at the pointed ends of ﬁlaments ? What is the role of proﬁlin ? What is the role of ATP hydrolysis , and is this related to changes in the putative nucleotide cleft in Arp2 or Arp3 ? Does activation of ﬁlament nucleation produce ﬁlament growth at the barbed or pointed end ? Why do branch points occur where they do ? How do Cdc42 and PIP 2 cooperate to release the inhibitory effect of WASP on Arp2 / 3 ? IV . ROLE OF TERNARY COMPLEXES IN REGULATING ACTIN CYTOSKELETON ASSEMBLY The foregoing discussion has probably created the impression that regulation of assembly and disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton is complex . In fact , the complex - ity may be comparable to the system that controls gene expression in eukaryotic genes where a promoter element contains the promoter - proximal upstream control ele - ments as well as enhancers and silencer elements . A further level of regulation is then provided by distal reg - ulatory sequences . DNA - bound proteins that can alter the state of condensation of the chromatin DNA also inﬂu - ence these DNA sequences . The control of actin cytoskel - eton assembly / disassembly may be even more complex . Just as we do not have a precise understanding of the control of gene expression , we are also only beginning to understand the control of location and mechanism of assembly of the actin cytoskeleton . Not only are there potentially multiple ABPs , but they are also capable of simultaneous expression within a single cell . The pres - ence of actin ligands such as ATP or ADP , Ca 2 (cid:2) or Mg 2 (cid:2) 460 DOS REMEDIOS ET AL . Physiol Rev • VOL 83 • APRIL 2003 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on O c t obe r 26 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m can also be important , as well as pH . Under these condi - tions , it would be surprising if control of the state of assembly was left to single ABPs as suggested in the preceding sections . The next level of complexity to con - sider is whether ternary complexes play a role and if so how is this achieved . Of course , quaternary and higher orders of complexity may also exist . There can be no argument that complexes of more than one ABP control actin ﬁlament functions ( see sect . III G ) . Activation by Ca 2 (cid:2) via the tropomyosin - troponin C / I / T complex is now well established , but there are also proteins that regulate ﬁlament length , anchoring into the Z - disk of sarcomeres , cap thin ﬁlaments , and connect actin to microtubules and the intermediate ﬁlament system . A . Coﬁlin , Actin , and DNase I It is widely accepted that regulation of the rate of assembly / disassembly ( treadmilling ) of the actin cy - toskeleton is achieved by a single ABP , probably ADF / coﬁlin ( 21 ) . However , the widespread use of DNase I afﬁnity chromatography to capture complexes of actin with other ABPs ( coﬁlin , destrin , actobindin , adseverin , ﬁmbrin , and radixin ) suggests that ternary complexes exist , at least in vitro ( 133 ) . We recently reported the formation of ternary complexes of actin , coﬁlin , and DNase I ( 57 ) using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . The afﬁnity of DNase I for G - actin is high ( nM K d ) , signiﬁcantly higher than for actin - coﬁlin ( (cid:4) M ) ( 266 ) . However , the afﬁnity of coﬁlin for the binary DNase I - actin complex is higher than for actin alone , and the reverse is also true , namely , the afﬁnity of DNase I is higher for the actin - coﬁlin complex than for actin alone . Thus when DNase I is present in a mixture of actin monomers and the coﬁlin - actin binary complex , it binds to the binary complex forming a ternary ( coﬁlin - actin - DNase I ) complex before it binds to the remaining free actin ( 205 ) . This ternary complex was recently suggested based on colocalization in monkey kidney epithelial cells ( 56 ) . In a report only just completed , we ( 81 ) have docu - mented the magnitude of actin conformational changes as a consequence of separately binding coﬁlin and DNase I and in the ternary coﬁlin - actin - DNase I complex . We used ﬂuorescence and ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer spectroscopy to demonstrate signiﬁcant conformational changes in the small domain ( subdomains 1 and 2 ) of monomeric actin . DNase I binding to actin increases by (cid:1) 1 Å the distance between probes attached to Gln - 41 and Cys - 374 . When coﬁlin alone binds to actin , this distance decreases by (cid:1) 3 Å , but when both bind ( ternary complex ) the distance increases by (cid:1) 4 Å . This effect is completely reversible and is independent of the order of addition . Thus the effects are not simply additive . We speculated that DNase I may act as a regulator of actin - coﬁlin inter - action and that the ternary complex may therefore be an important element in the regulation of microﬁlament as - sembly ( 142 ) , effectively removing coﬁlin from the cellu - lar pool and thereby preventing its normal ability to po - lymerize . The ternary complex may be destabilized by other ABPs such as proﬁlin or gelsolin , which alter the bound nucleotide presumably via an allosteric conforma - tional change . Such a regulatory mechanism would occur on a slow time scale equivalent to the rate of appearance and disappearance of DNase I and would depend on the balance of free ABPs , pH , and divalent cations present in the cell . B . Ternary Complexes of Actin With Two or More ABPs The actin - DNase I binary complex is unusual but not unique in its ability to form a ternary complex with coﬁlin . Proﬁlin can be chemically cross - linked to actin - DNase I ; however , in the absence of cross - linking , a negative co - operativity was observed ( 12 ) , i . e . , proﬁlin dissociates DNase I from actin , and vice versa . DNase I and gelsolin also bind to actin in a negatively cooperative way . Chem - ical cross - linking of Cys residues between T (cid:1) 4 and actin - DNase also revealed the formation of a ternary complex ( 239 ) . These authors found that the K d of T (cid:1) 4 for actin - DNase I was the same as for actin alone ( see Table 1 ) , and they concluded that the binding loci for these two ABPs do not overlap . Others ( 13 ) reported that T (cid:1) 4 competes with gelsolin segment 1 , but both are dissociated by the binding of DNase I to actin . A similar negative coopera - tivity between spatially separated actin - binding sites was observed between DNase I and gelsolin segment 1 ( 12 ) . Thus , although the binding site for DNase I is physically separated from the sites for gelsolin segment 1 , T (cid:1) 4 , and proﬁlin , the negatively cooperative nature of their inter - actions suggests that an allosteric conformational change may be transmitted along the “length” of the small domain of actin . Capping of the pointed ends of actin ﬁlaments by tropomodulin ( Tmod , discussed above ) appears to in - volve a ternary complex . Tmod binds only weakly to F - actin , but the afﬁnity of Tmod for actin increases nearly three orders of magnitude in the presence of tropomyo - sin . Rapid exchange of Tmod at this end permits assembly and disassembly of these ﬁlaments . The same is probably true for CapZ and other proteins that cap the barbed end of ﬁlaments . In a two - hybrid system , actin interacting protein 1 ( Aip1 ; a 65 - kDa protein ) was shown to form a ternary complex with actin and ADF / coﬁlin ( 245 ) . In yeast , Aip1 interacts with actin via subdomains 3 and 4 ( 5 ) , and some of these residues do not overlap those for ADF / coﬁlin and ACTIN AND ACTIN BINDING PROTEINS 461 Physiol Rev • VOL 83 • APRIL 2003 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on O c t obe r 26 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m other ABPs . AIP1 alone has little or no ﬁlament severing activity , but it exhibits a cooperative ﬁlament severing activity in the presence of Xenopus ADF / coﬁlin ( 245 ) . This ability of Aip1 to recognize ADF / coﬁlin bound to ﬁlaments may be important in the modulation of ADF / coﬁlin activity . Drugs like cytochalasin D act directly on the actin cytoskeleton by altering the rate of assembly / disassembly at both the pointed and barbed ends of the ﬁlaments . A recent structural analysis of latrunculin - A ( 193 ) revealed that it binds only to actin monomers and prevents poly - merization by inducing speciﬁc structural changes . The binding site was not previously known to be an ABP binding locus . Crystals of actin - gelsolin segment 1 were soaked in latrunculin - A , and crystallographic reﬁnement of the resulting ternary complex revealed that it tightly links subdomains 2 and 4 of actin . Latrunculin - A produces local rather than global structural changes in actin , allo - sterically altering the surfaces involved in the assembly of F - actin . This effect is achieved by restricting the rotations of subdomains 2 and 4 . Thus ternary complexes involving actin appear to be important for the action of some drugs . V . THE CYTOSKELETON AND PATHOLOGY Many of the proteins discussed above are affected by mutations resulting in the development of signiﬁcant pa - thology . Given the central role played by actin and the ABPs , this outcome is not surprising ( see Ref . 21a ) . A . Actin Actin has a remarkably conserved amino acid se - quence , probably more than any other protein . This alone suggests that mutations have been eliminated rather than tolerated by the genome . Because actins are essential for motility , force generation , and other important cellular functions , it is remarkable that so few diseases are asso - ciated with primary defects in microﬁlaments and their regulators . No doubt , part of the reason is that there are usually multiple actin genes , i . e . , the problem is circum - vented by redundancy . Perhaps the same evolutionary pressures that main - tained the highly conserved sequences of actins also pro - tected them from being a major player in the disease process . Because of its pivotal role , defects or alterations in actin probably have dramatic effects on survival when no alternate actin gene is available ( e . g . , yeast has a single actin gene which is lethal when disrupted ) . A major obstacle to studying the altered properties of mutant actins is the considerable difﬁculty cell biologists have had in expressing actin using standard protein ex - pression systems . Bacteria have no actin of their own and are therefore a logical choice as an expression system . Only one report ( 100 ) suggested that bacterial expression could yield native actin , and the ﬁndings of this report have not been repeated . Yeast can be used to express mutant actins ( 246 ) , although the yield of the inserted actin gene product is impractically low . There are mouse ﬁbroblast cell lines that express almost pure nonmuscle (cid:1) - actin ( 252 ) , but these are spe - cial cases . Most cells express more than one actin isoform and , although several methods have been described for separating them , for example , hydroxyapatite column chromatography ( 260 ) , they are technically challenging . Some actin mutations ( for example , removal of the NH 2 - terminal acidic residues ) are not essential for the survival of yeast but are needed to activate myosin ATPase activ - ity ( 64 ) . More than 150 papers have reported (cid:1) 300 actin mu - tations ( 266 ) . Only a handful deal with human actin mu - tations , and most of these are deletion mutants near the COOH terminus . Three at residues 336 , 346 , and 356 re - sulted in the production of nonfunctional actin . The re - maining deletions at residues 366 , 373 , and 374 had sig - niﬁcantly reduced functionality . In a recent review , Mar - ston and Hodgkinson ( 178 ) observed that 13 actin mutations were known to cause hypertrophic cardiomy - opathy ( E99K , A331P , P164A , A295S ) , dilated cardiomy - opathy ( R312H , E361G ) , severe nemaline myopathy ( R183C , R256H , N280K , V370F , L94P ) , and actin myopathy ( G15R , V163L ) . Clearly , caution is needed in drawing sweeping conclusions about the functional effects of these structural changes . However , when these mutant actins can be expressed in substantial quantities , we can begin to understand the functional consequences of mu - tant actins in organs where more than one actin gene is coexpressed ( 25 ) . B . Gelsolin If the actin cytoskeleton plays a signiﬁcant role in disease , and in particular tumors ( 215 ) , then we would also expect its associated ABPs to be involved in the disorder or disease . The functions of gelsolin have been described above , but it is also a substrate for the apopto - tic enzyme caspase - 3 ( 150 ) that cleaves the actin - binding domain of gelsolin from its calcium - binding domain . Phys - ical separation of these two domains coincides with plasma membrane blebbing , one of the hallmarks of apo - ptosis . Overexpression of the Ca 2 (cid:2) - independent NH 2 - ter - minal half of gelsolin induces apoptosis , whereas gelsolin null neutrophils have a delayed onset of apoptosis ( 150 ) . Cancer cells characteristically lack apoptotic mecha - nisms and express less gelsolin ( 157 ) , whereas expression of mutated ( His - 321 ) gelsolin is associated with the loss of tumorigenicity of transformed cells ( 102 ) . Normally , plasma gelsolin functions as a part of the 462 DOS REMEDIOS ET AL .

The D187N and D187Y gelsolin mutations generate a 71 - residue fragment that forms amyloid ﬁbrils in humans . These mutations were also associated with familial amyloidosis of the Finnish type ( FAF ) ( 139 ) . The symptoms of FAF patients include the accumulation in their tissues of amyloid derived from plasma gelsolin ( 285 ) . Neither the recombinant wild - type nor the D187N FAF - associated gelsolin fragments self - associate into amyloid at pH 7 . 5 , but incubation of either fragment at low pH values ( 6 . 0 – 4 . 0 ) produces well - deﬁned ﬁbrils ( 237 ) . C . Tropomodulin Changes in gene expression of this thin ﬁlament cap - ping protein produce a surprisingly extensive range of phenotypes . Increases in Tmod expression levels are as - sociated with the dilation ( rather than the hypertrophic ) component in human dilated cardiomyopathy ( 306 ) . In a transgenic mouse model , inhibition of Tmod expression prevents dilation ( 279 ) but not hypertrophy of the myo - cardium . Tmod is a promising development in our under - standing of this bafﬂing disorder ( 278 ) . Graves’ disease is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by multiple susceptible loci involving cyto - toxic T cells , HLA antigens , and thyroid - stimulating hor - mone receptors ( 299 ) . Human Tmod has (cid:1) 40 % identity at the NH 2 and COOH termini of the 64 - kDa autoantigen protein identiﬁed in Graves’ disease . The insertion of several homologous repeats in the midsection of the Graves’ protein together with an extension of the COOH terminus of Tmod accounts for the differences in length between the Graves’ protein ( 572 residues ) and tropo - modulin ( 359 residues ) ( 299 ) . It is therefore likely the two genes evolved from a common ancestral gene ( 276 ) . The gene for Tmod was assigned to human chromosome 9 in a region also known to contain several other genes and disease loci , for example , an unrelated cytoskeletal gene for gelsolin . Finally , two genes encoding for Tmod that map next to another on human chromosome 15 make them candi - dates for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and a dyslexia gene as well as a candidate gene for limb girdle muscular dystrophy ( 70 ) . At this stage it is not clear how these syndromes are related to Tmod expression disorders , but the clear link suggests that Tmod is a key gene . D . Connections Between the Extracellular Matrix and the Nucleus Maniotis et al . ( 175 ) showed that a mechanical tug on cell surface receptors can immediately change the orga - nization of proteins in the cytoplasm and the nucleus . They showed that by speciﬁcally pulling on cell surface integrin receptors , the nucleus was elongated in the di - rection of the pull . Furthermore , they showed that this effect on the nuclear membrane was mediated by the actin cytoskeleton . The actin cytoskeleton also provides a physical connection between ion channels such as ClC3 chloride ion channels in the cell membrane and the inte - rior of the cell ( 33 ) . Defects , deﬁciencies , or deletions of any component of the linkage between the extracellular matrix ( lami - nin - 2 , (cid:2) - dystroglycan ) , trans - sarcolemmal proteins ( (cid:2) - , (cid:1) - , and (cid:3) - sarcoglycans , (cid:1) - dystroglycan ) , the cytoskeleton ( dystrophin , dystrobrevin , syntrophin , actin ) , and the nu - cleus ( emerin , lamin A / C ) would dramatically alter this putative mechanical signaling ( 175 ) and thus affect the mechanical stability of cardiomyocytes . Altered expression of cytoskeletal , linkage , and ex - tracellular proteins has been reported in hypertrophied cardiomyocytes ( 280 , 282 ) and also in failing myocytes ( 61 , 83 , 122 ) . Changes in expression levels of ﬁbronectin , laminin , ﬁbrillin , ﬁbulin SC1 , and decorin , all components of the extracellular matrix , are upregulated in rat exper - imental myocardial infarctions ( 269 ) . A number of mono - genetic cardiomyopathies have recently been detailed in a selected number of families , which include a range of different genes involved in the surface - nucleus pathway ( 55 ) . Thus cytoskeletal proteins may be involved in the progressive defects leading to heart failure . Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy appears to be a ﬁnal common outcome for gene defects involving an astonishing variety of cy - toskeletal and sarcomeric proteins . E . Heart Failure Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( FHC ) is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting in increased myo - cardial mass and myoﬁbrillar disarray . It is the most common cause of sudden death in the young . Linkage studies and candidate - gene approaches have revealed dis - ease - causing mutations in more than eight different genes all encoding sarcomeric proteins . More than 100 muta - tions have already been identiﬁed , and they involve prac - tically every protein component in the sarcomere . Muta - tions are observed in (cid:1) - myosin heavy chain ( 105 ) , tropo - nin I ( 144 , 92 ) , troponin T ( 238 ) , (cid:2) - tropomyosin ( 282 ) , myosin - binding protein C ( 296 ) , regulatory and essential myosin light chains ( 226 ) , cardiac (cid:2) - actin ( 209 ) , titin ( 253 ) , and desmin ( 122 , 253 ) . However , these mutations are present in only half the patients ( 296 ) , and conse - quently , there must be other gene mutations that cause FHC , some of which will probably involve the cytoskele - ton . The common phenotype resulting from a wide range of cytoskeletal / sarcomeric proteins may well prove to be a reﬂection of the functional linkage of these proteins to both the extracellular matrix and the nucleus in cardio - myocytes . ACTIN AND ACTIN BINDING PROTEINS 463 Physiol Rev • VOL 83 • APRIL 2003 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on O c t obe r 26 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Studies of human dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) ( 306 ) and of mouse models ( 279 ) of DCM also point to a critical role of cytoskeletal elements at the Z - disks in chamber dilation . Mice lacking the muscle LIM - domain protein ( MLP ) , a Z - disk protein that interacts directly with (cid:2) - actinin , displayed many of the features of human DCM ( 8 ) . Mutations ( usually more than one per protein ) in other proteins associated with (cid:2) - actinin , cardiac (cid:2) - actin , desmin , and titin were subsequently found in familial forms of DCM ( 76 , 209 , 253 ) . Also , mutations of other Z - disk components in the mouse result in DCM ( 55 , 59 ) . Mechanical stress on the extracellular matrix leads to defects in Z - disk formation , sarcomeric stabilization , and altered muscle - cell signaling , thereby driving the onset of chamber dilation and heart failure ( 58 ) . In a dog model of heart failure , cytoskeletal actin was upregulated while desmin ( a protein in the intercalated disks ) was down - regulated ( 122 ) . F . Gene Arrays Yang et al . ( 306 ) used gene array technology to ex - amine altered genes in failing human hearts . They ob - served an increased expression of gelsolin and a signiﬁ - cant upregulation of (cid:2) - B - crystallin , a desmin - associated protein that protects or chaperones actin and desmin ﬁlaments from stress - induced damage . (cid:2) - B - crystallin is a member of 27 - kDa heat shock protein family . These data ( using Affymetrix gene arrays ) were conﬁrmed by us ( using NEN arrays ) ( 135 ) . They support the view that the actin cytoskeleton is damaged in DCM . Samples of failing left ventricles have been studied by two - dimensional gel electrophoresis of human DCM patients ( 68 ) and of an animal model of DCM ( 122 ) . In another form ( familial hypertrophic ) of human heart failure , the expression of (cid:2) - actin , plasma gelsolin , thymosin (cid:1) 4 , and several other cytoskeletal proteins ( 23 ) changed more than twofold . Finally , gene arrays have been used to examine an exper - imental myocardial infarction using failing rat hearts ( 269 ) . Cytoskeletal actin and several ABPs ( (cid:2) - actin , thy - mosin (cid:1) 4 and (cid:1) 19 , Arp2 / 3 and a number of other ABPs not reviewed here ) were upregulated . The data clearly impli - cate the involvement of cytoskeletal and myoﬁbrillar genes in human heart failure . Thus there is growing evi - dence for altered expression of cytoskeletal proteins in heart failure . It is likely that similar results will be re - ported for the failure of other organs . G . Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms , Diseases , and the Cytoskeleton A relatively new method of determining the connec - tions between human diseases and gene mutations in - volves analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) from human populations . The idea here is that SNPs ( unlike most other analytical methods ) are poten - tially capable of discovering the cause of disease . A number of companies have developed technologies for analyzing SNPs , but the most challenging aspect of the technology is its ability to accurately detect very small differences between DNA restriction fragments in which only one base pair has been replaced ( e . g . , T instead of A or G instead of a C base pair , or vice versa ) . Sequenom ( www . sequenom . com ) has developed a method that very accurately “weighs” the DNA fragments using mass spec - trometry which achieves precisions of (cid:5) 99 . 9 % . It is de - batable whether this accuracy is really needed , although their approach was both unusual and effective . They have identiﬁed at least three cytoskeletal proteins that are statistically associated with speciﬁc diseases in speciﬁc human populations . These diseases have a late onset and are not associated with mortality in infants , juveniles , or young adults . H . Cell Signaling and Actin Microﬁlaments In mammals , there is a well - deﬁned connection be - tween extracellular signals ( like insulin ) , their membrane receptors , intracellular signals ( Ras and Rac ) , and the regulators of actin microﬁlament assembly ( Arp2 / 3 , gel - solin , ADF / coﬁlin ) . Because the binding of ligands to some surface receptors is known to activate genes , the cytoskeletal links may extend from the membrane all the way to the nuclei and perhaps even to the chromosomes . The control of these connections in yeast , Drosophila , and mammalian cells was recently summarized by Hall and colleagues ( 24 ) . The relationships between compo - nents of the signaling pathways are complex and are beyond the scope of this review . VI . UNRESOLVED ISSUES A . Atomic Structure of F - actin It is common to assume that because we know all or most of the structural atomic details of the actin mono - mer , the available models of F - actin are equally valid . How good is this assumption ? It is true that the known atomic structures of mono - meric actins are very similar . However , signiﬁcant differ - ences are beginning to emerge . Nearly all of the available atomic structures were achieved using actin cocrystal - lized with an ABP . Recently , a new structure of actin was reported ( 217 ) that is not complexed to an ABP . These authors observed “a dramatic conformational change in subdomain 2” compared with previous structures . It will therefore be of considerable interest to see the effect the 464 DOS REMEDIOS ET AL . Physiol Rev • VOL 83 • APRIL 2003 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on O c t obe r 26 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m new structure from Dominguez et al . ( 217 ) has on a model of F - actin with its bound ADP . Bound nucleotide can have dramatic effects on the structure of actin and on the afﬁnities of ABPs for actin . Three - dimensional recon - structions of electron micrographs of actin ﬁlaments are based on low - resolution structural data . Thus the avail - able models make assumptions about the arrangement and orientation of the monomers in the ﬁlament . To date , most ﬁlament models ( 128 , 167 , 283 ) have been con - structed using the structures from actin cocrystals with ABPs , and there is an assumption that this is unaltered in the ﬁlament . Arguably , ﬁlaments are the most biologically relevant form of actin in cells , so there is a real need to resolve their structure at high resolution . Several groups are currently working on this most difﬁcult , perhaps in - tractable , structural problem . B . Functional Differences Between Actin Isoforms The great majority of the several thousand references on this topic have used rabbit skeletal muscle actin . Only very small sequence differences exist between different actin isoforms , and these probably have functional con - sequences . For example , the myocardium of small mam - mals like mice and rats expresses almost pure cardiac (cid:2) - actin , whereas cardiomyocytes in larger animals ( in - cluding humans ) express about equal amounts of cardiac and skeletal (cid:2) - actin ( 25 , 113 ) . Why do larger hearts ex - press skeletal muscle actin ? (cid:3) - Actin isoforms are located just beneath the sarcolemma , whereas only (cid:2) - actins are incorporated into sarcomeres ( 113 ) . We do not know if isoforms can coassemble or whether such ﬁlaments have different effects on activities such as myosin ATPase . Very little is known about the functional differences be - tween actin isoforms . Even less is known about whether certain ABPs bind to particular actin isoforms and whether differences in actin isoform structure determine which ABPs bind . The situation is no clearer for ADF / coﬁlin . We know there are functional differences ( nucleation , elongation , fragmenting , binding ratios to actin ) between ADFs and coﬁlins , but comparisons based on existing literature are difﬁcult because groups investigating these properties of - ten use different ( yeast , chick , human ) isoforms . There may also be differences between isoforms within the coﬁlins and ADFs , and these will have subtle but impor - tant functional effects . C . Ternary Complexes of Monomeric Actin With ABPs We have reviewed the evidence for a ternary complex between actin monomers and two ABPs , coﬁlin and DNase I . Although there is good evidence for a ternary complex involving monomeric actin in vitro , is there a role for ternary complexes in vivo ? The more details we learn about the ABPs , the more they seem to ﬁt into families with common cellular functions . Not all DNases bind actin , so it is still not clear if they can play a universal role . D . Undiscovered ABPs Despite the proliferation of ABPs over recent years ( 65 new proteins have been discovered over the past 5 years , Ref . 151 ) , there are still signiﬁcant areas of the actin monomer surface that do not appear to be the site for ABPs ( see Fig . 6 ) . Some of this surface may come to be occupied by known but not yet fully characterized ABPs . It is unlikely that we have discovered all of the ABPs , and it seems a safe bet to suggest that as the human genome and other genomes become reﬁned , at least some of the “orphan” genes will turn out to be new ABPs . E . Cooperative Binding of ABPs Along Filaments There is a spatial separation and organization of ﬁl - ament nucleation , elongation , branching , and other pro - cesses involving actin assembly and disassembly , but lit - tle or nothing is known about the controls of these pro - cesses . For example , we know that Arp2 / 3 produces a regular branching of actin microﬁlaments and that this regular branching is important for the protrusion of cyto - plasmic blebs and ﬁngers ( 195 ) , but what controls the distribution of Arp2 / 3 ? In muscle thin ﬁlaments , binding of a myosin head at one point alters the probability of a second head binding up to several monomers along the ﬁlament . What conformational changes are involved here , and how are they propagated along the ﬁlaments ? ADF / coﬁlin binds cooperatively to F - actin , but does this coop - erativity depend on the actin isoform ? F . Cytoskeletal Proteins in the Nucleus A number of cytoskeletal proteins are found in the nucleus including coﬁlin ( 56 , 203 ) ( which has a nuclear localization peptide ) and actin ( which lack this se - quence ) . We do not know the functions of these proteins or how they are regulated . G . Disease and the Cytoskeleton The role of the cytoskeleton and ABPs in disease is an emerging story . There can be little doubt that several cytoskeletal proteins are positively associated with signif - icant human disease . Sequenom of San Diego and Gemini Genomics PLC of Cambridge recently discovered three of ACTIN AND ACTIN BINDING PROTEINS 465 Physiol Rev • VOL 83 • APRIL 2003 • www . prv . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on O c t obe r 26 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys r e v . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m these proteins , but their identities have not yet been disclosed . However , it is possible that identiﬁcation of speciﬁc disease - associated genes may not produce a com - plete understanding of the disease process for we know that a single phenotype like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be the product of mutations in almost any one of the myoﬁbrillar proteins . H . Prokaryotic Cytoskeletal Elements It seems likely that the ancestor of eukaryotic actin is the bacterial protein MreB . This protein can self - assemble and contributes to structures that resemble straightened actin rails . This discovery prompts questions like : Are there MreB - binding proteins , equivalent to ABPs , that control ﬁlament assembly ? Do bacteria have motor pro - teins that employ the MreB “rails” ?
