Whereas the formin - homology ( FH ) 2 domains mediate processive association , the FH1 domains—in concert with the actin - monomer - binding protein proﬁ - lin—increase the rate of barbed - end elongation . The mechanism by which this effect is achieved is not well understood . Results : We used total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy to measure the effect of proﬁlin on the elon - gation of single actin ﬁlaments associated with FH1FH2 constructs ( derived from the formin Bni1p from S . cere - visiae ) with FH1 domains containing one to eight proﬁlin - binding polyproline tracks . Over a large range of proﬁlin concentrations ( 0 . 5 – 25 m M ) , the rate of barbed - end elon - gation increases with the number of polyproline tracks in the FH1 domain . The binding of proﬁlin - actin to the FH1 domain is the rate - limiting step ( up to rates of at least 88 s 2 1 ) in FH1 - mediated transfer of actin subunits to the barbed end . Dissociation of formins from barbed ends growing in the presence of proﬁlin is proportional to the elongation rate . Proﬁlin profoundly inhibits nucle - ation by FH2 and FH1FH2 constructs , but proﬁlin - actin bound to FH1 might contribute weakly to nucleation . Conclusions : To achieve fast elongation , formin FH1 domains bind proﬁlin - actin complexes and deliver them rapidly to the barbed end associated with the FH2 domain . Because subunit addition promotes disso - ciation of FH2 domains from growing barbed ends , FH2 domains must pass through a state that is prone to dis - sociation during each cycle of actin subunit addition coupled to formin translocation . Introduction Formin proteins are required for the assembly of various actin structures in eukaryotes , including polarized ca - bles in budding yeast [ 1 ] , contractile rings in ﬁssion yeast [ 2 ] , interphase cables in ﬁssion yeast [ 3 ] , and stress ﬁbers [ 4 ] and ﬁlopodia [ 5 ] in animal cells . Along with Arp2 / 3 complex and Spire , formins are one of three families of well - characterized proteins that nucleate actin ﬁlaments . These proteins differ mechanistically in how they promote nucleation . Whereas the other pro - teins allow growth of free barbed ends following nucle - ation [ 6 , 7 ] , formins remain bound to the growing barbed end of a nucleated ﬁlament [ 8 – 11 ] —a phenomenon known as processive association . The highly conserved formin - homology ( FH ) 2 domain of many formins sufﬁces for nucleation [ 12 – 15 ] and processive association in vitro [ 9 ] . FH2 domains , typi - cally w 400 – 500 amino acids long [ 16 , 17 ] , form dimers that encircle the barbed end of an actin ﬁlament [ 18 ] . Barbed ends associated with many types of FH2 - con - taining constructs elongate slower than free ends [ 9 , 10 , 19 , 20 ] . To explain this behavior , some have pro - posed that ends associated with FH2 equilibrate between an open state , which allows addition of actin subunits , and a closed state , which prevents subunit ad - dition [ 18 ] . The FH1 domains of most formins lie N - terminal to the FH2 domain and are predicted to be disordered except for multiple discrete stretches of contiguous proline res - idues [ 16 ] . These polyproline tracks are expected to form rigid type - II polyproline helices , which serve as binding sites for the actin - monomer - binding protein proﬁlin [ 2 , 21 ] . Proﬁlin increases the rate of elongation of actin - ﬁlament barbed ends associated with formins containing both FH1 and FH2 domains ( FH1FH2 ) [ 9 – 11 , 19 ] , often above the diffusion - limited rate of elongation of free barbed ends [ 22 ] . Given that the elongation rates of barbed ends associated with FH1FH2 domains from various formins are proportional to the concentration of proﬁlin - actin , one model to explain their behavior is that multiple polyproline tracks in FH1 domains each bind complexes of proﬁlin - actin and deliver them to the formin - associated barbed end [ 9 , 23 ] . FH1 domains are found in most eukaryotic formins [ 16 ] but vary widely in their numbers of polyproline tracks . Proﬁlin increases the elongation rate of barbed ends associated with FH1FH2 - formins roughly in pro - portion to the number of FH1 polyproline tracks [ 9 ] . The signiﬁcance of this relationship , however , has not been clear because different formins contain unique FH2 domains , which alone differ in their effects on ﬁla - ment elongation . To study the effect of the number of FH1 proﬁlin - binding sites on formin - associated elonga - tion , we measured elongation with formin constructs containing identical FH2 domains but FH1 domains that differ in their numbers of polyproline tracks . We combined measurements of single ﬁlaments associated with formins with the full time courses of polymerization of bulk samples to evaluate the effect of the FH1 domain onnucleation of ends fromactincomplexedwithproﬁlin . Results We made several FH1FH2 constructs with the Bni1p FH2 domain attached to variant FH1 domains . These FH1 do - mains were derived from Bni1p and contained between * Correspondence : thomas . pollard @ yale . edu one and eight polyproline tracks ( Figure 1 ) . We named these constructs collectively Bni1 ( pP n FH2 ) p , in which n denotes the number of FH1 polyproline tracks . The FH1 domainofBni1phasfourpolyprolinetracks , threeofwhich ( A – C ) fulﬁll the criterion for proﬁlin binding—that is , they have at least six prolines out of seven consecutive residues [ 24 , 25 ] . The proﬁlin - binding capacity of the PPxPPxxP sequence of track D was less certain , but it is active , because ends associated with Bni1 ( pP 1 FH2 ) p in the presence of proﬁlin elongate faster than those associ - ated with the FH2 domain alone . We also note that both tracks A and B are long enough to bind two proﬁlins [ 26 , 27 ] . Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p , with four polyproline tracks , has been studied previously [ 9 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 28 ] . Bni1 ( pP 8 FH2 ) p contains two consecutive full - length FH1 domains . We used time - lapse total internal reﬂection ﬂuores - cence microscopy ( TIRFM ) and actin , with the dye Ore - gon - green conjugated to Cys - 374 ( 33 % of the total actin ) , to directly observe the growth of individual actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 2 ) . We measured rates of elongation in association with Bni1 ( pP n FH2 ) p over a range of con - centrations of S . cerevisiae proﬁlin ( Figure 3 ) and muscle actin monomers ( Figure 4 ) . Samples contained ﬁlaments with barbed ends asso - ciated with formins as well as free barbed ends ; we used the free barbed ends as internal controls for the effects of formin association . To distinguish free ends from ends associated with a formin in a given viewing ﬁeld , we observed differences in the elongation rates of ﬁla - ments , the ﬂuorescence intensities of the ﬁlaments , or both . Without proﬁlin , free and formin - associated ﬁla - ments were similarly ﬂuorescent , but ends associated with a formin grew at w 40 % – 50 % the rate of free barbed ends ( Figure 3A ) . In the presence of proﬁlin , free barbed ends and those associated with Bni1 ( FH2 ) p had similar ﬂuorescence intensities , but ends associated with FH2 alone grew substantially slower than free barbed ends ( Figures 2A and 3A ) . By contrast , ends growing in asso - ciation with the Bni1 ( pP n FH2 ) p FH1 variants were dimmer in the presence of proﬁlin than free barbed ends ( Figure 2B ) . This behavior can be understood by considering that FH1 - bound proﬁlin - actin is highly favoredforadditiontobarbedendsoverbulk - phaseactin [ 9 , 23 ] and that proﬁlin has a higher afﬁnity for unlabeled actin than for actin modiﬁed at Cys - 374 [ 29 ] . At many concentrations of proﬁlin , ends associated with Bni1 - ( pP n FH2 ) p constructs could be further distinguished from free barbed ends , because the formin - associated ﬁlaments grew substantially faster ( Figures 2B and 3 ) . Inﬂuence of the Number of FH1 Polyproline Tracks on Barbed - End Elongation with Proﬁlin Proﬁlin stimulated the elongation of barbed ends asso - ciated with all of the Bni1 ( pP n FH2 ) p constructs , as ob - served previously for Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p and three other FH1FH2 - formins [ 9 – 11 , 19 ] . In all of our experiments with 1 . 5 m M actin , the rates of elongation of barbed ends associated with the Bni1 ( pP n FH2 ) p constructs peaked at 2 . 5 to 5 m M proﬁlin and declined with higher proﬁlin concentrations ( Figure 3A ) . Proﬁlin weakly in - hibited elongation of barbed ends associated with the FH2 domain alone , with the rate decreasing slightly from 5 . 7 subunits / s without proﬁlin to 3 . 2 subunits / s at 25 m M proﬁlin . High concentrations of proﬁlin also slightly inhibited elongation of free barbed ends . The rates of elongation of ﬁlaments associated with Bni1 ( pP n FH2 ) p increased with the total number of FH1 polyproline tracks at all concentrations of proﬁlin ( Figure 3B ) , suggesting that the individual tracks of pol - yproline capture proﬁlin - actin complexes from the bulk solution and transfer them onto the barbed end as Figure 1 .

Formin - associated barbed ends grew at an average rate of 32 . 6 subunits / s for Bni1 ( pP 8 FH2 ) p and 4 . 5 subunits / s for Bni1 ( FH2 ) p . Free barbed ends in the same viewing ﬁelds grew at 13 . 1 subunits / s for Bni1 ( pP 8 FH2 ) p and 11 . 7 subunits / s for Bni1 ( FH2 ) p . Current Biology Vol 18 No 1 10 proposed previously [ 9 , 23 ] . In general , each additional track contributed less to the elongation rate as the total number of tracks increased ( Figure 3C ) . This effect was more pronounced at higher proﬁlin concentrations . Proﬁlin - Actin Binding to the FH1 Domain Limits Formin - Mediated Barbed - End Elongation The elongation rates of barbed ends associated with Bni1 ( FH2 ) p , Bni1 ( pP 1 FH2 ) p , orBni1 ( pP 8 FH2 ) pincreased with the concentration of actin in the presence of 5 m M proﬁlin ( Figure 4A ) . FH1FH2 - mediated polymerization in proﬁlin - actin proceeds through multiple pathways , including addition of free actin and proﬁlin - actin onto the formin - associated barbed ends in a manner inde - pendent of the FH1 domain [ 9 , 23 ] . To correct for the contribution to elongation of pathways other than those related to FH1 and proﬁlin - actin , we plotted the differ - ences in elongation rates between ﬁlaments associated with the polyproline - containing constructs and FH2 alone ( D pP n - FH2 ) versus the concentration of proﬁlin - actin Figure 3 .

Proﬁlin and Formin - Mediated Actin Assembly 11 ( Figure 4B ) . For both Bni1 ( pP 1 FH2 ) p and Bni1 ( pP 8 FH2 ) p , thecontributionofFH1toelongation , presumablythrough proﬁlin - actin binding and transfer , was proportional to the proﬁlin - actin concentration . For Bni1 ( pP 8 FH2 ) p , proﬁlin - actin limited FH1 - mediated elongation up to 88 sub - units / s , showing that binding of proﬁlin - actin to the FH1 domain limited transfer of proﬁlin - actin by FH1 to the end of the ﬁlament . For both Bni1 ( pP 1 FH2 ) p and Bni1 ( pP 8 FH2 ) p , the slopes of these plots ( Figure 4B ) indicate how quickly FH1 transfers proﬁlin - actin to the formin - associated barbed end . The single polyproline track pP D of Bni1 ( pP 1 FH2 ) p transfers proﬁlin - actin to the FH2 - associated barbed end with an apparent sec - ond - order rate constant of 9 . 9 m M 2 1 s 2 1 . The seven additional FH1 polyproline tracks of Bni1 ( pP 8 FH2 ) p increase this transfer rate constant to 39 m M 2 1 s 2 1 . Dissociation of Formin Depends on the Elongation Rate FH1FH2 - formins are highly processive but have a ﬁnite probability of dissociating from growing barbed ends [ 9 ] . We measured the initial rate of dissociation of Bni1 ( pP 8 FH2 ) p from barbed ends growing in 5 m M proﬁ - lin over a range of actin concentrations ( Figure 5A ) and found that the dissociation rate is roughly proportional to the elongation rate ( Figure 5B ) , increasing from w 0 . 001 s 2 1 when ends elongate at 18 subunits / s to w 0 . 005 s 2 1 when ends elongate at > 100 subunits / s . The probability of dissociation is therefore low—on the order of once per 20 , 000 subunit additions . Effect of Proﬁlin and the FH1 Domain on Nucleation of Actin Filaments by the FH2 Domain All of our Bni1p constructs stimulated spontaneous as - sembly of bulk samples of pyrene - labeled actin mono - mers ( Figure 6A ) . As shown previously [ 12 – 14 ] , the FH2 domain of Bni1p is sufﬁcient for this activity . We measured nucleation by calculating the concen - tration of barbed ends present when half of the actin was polymerized . This calculation depended upon our knowing the rates of elongation ( from microscopy ) un - der all of these conditions . Without proﬁlin , the presence of an FH1 domain with proﬁlin - binding sites neither pro - moted nor inhibited the nucleation activity of the associ - ated Bni1p FH2 domain over a range of formin concen - trations ( Figure 6B ) . Bni1 ( FH2 ) p ( Figure 6B , inset ) and our various Bni1 ( pP n FH2 ) p constructs ( not shown ) all produced a maximum of approximately one end per formin dimer . The efﬁciency of nucleation declined at higher formin concentrations , because the numerous growing ends rapidly depleted actin monomers before all of the FH2 dimers initiated new ﬁlaments . Proﬁlin slowed polymer assembly from actin mono - mers in the presence of either Bni1 ( FH2 ) p ( Figure 7A ) or Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( not shown ) . For Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p , we could not directly calculate the number of ﬁlaments formed from the time course of the ﬂuorescence change , because proﬁlin inhibits incorporation of la - beled actin into the growing ﬁlaments associated with polyproline - containing formins ( Figure 2B ) . The ﬂuores - cence of pyrenyl - actin , therefore , does not accurately reﬂect the total actin - polymer concentration . Instead , we used computational methods to simulate actin poly - merization and estimate the nucleation activity of FH1FH2 in the presence of proﬁlin . Our simulations took into account all of the interactions of proﬁlin , actin , pyrenyl - actin , FH1 domains , FH2 domains , and ﬁlament ends , which together give rise to the observed signal from pyrenyl - actin in bulk polymerization assays ( Fig - ure S1 and Table S1 , available online ) . We compared the polymerization half - times for experiments and simu - lations to judge the adequacy of hypothetical mecha - nisms and rate constants to account for observations . Perfect agreement between computational and solution data would yield a value of 1 at all proﬁlin concentrations for the ratio of the simulated to experimental half - time . We used polymerization with Bni1 ( FH2 ) p and a range of proﬁlin concentrations to establish a baseline for Figure 5 . Dissociation of Bni1 ( pP 8 FH2 ) p from Barbed Ends Conditions as in Figure 4 .

( B ) The dependence of the initial rate of dissociation of Bni1 ( pP 8 FH2 ) p from growing barbed ends ( slopes from [ A ] ) on the average barbed - end elongation rate of the ﬁlaments ( from Figure 4A ) . Current Biology Vol 18 No 1 12 comparisons of simulated and experimental assembly reactions . Under these conditions , we expected this construct to nucleate ends only from free actin mono - mers [ 13 ] . The simulated time courses were somewhat faster than the experiments ( Figure 7B , bottom panel ) , but the simulations closely matched the dependence of nucleation by formin on the proﬁlin concentration ( Figure S2 ) . The divergences between the simulated and experimental time courses are probably due to un - certainties in the simulation parameters . Simulations gave half - times similar to experiments for Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p , if one assumes that the formin nucle - ates ends exclusively from free actin monomers and not proﬁlin - actin ( Figure 7B , top panel ) . Simulated as - sembly agreed more closely with the experiment for Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p than for FH2 alone , especially at higher concentrations of proﬁlin . Although participation of pro - ﬁlin - actin is not required to explain nucleation by Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p , we used simulations to test the hypoth - esis that the FH1 domain enables FH2 to use proﬁlin - actin for nucleation [ 13 ] . We simulated assembly with a mechanism that allows the creation of an end from two proﬁlin - actin complexes bound simultaneously to opposite FH1 domains on a single formin dimer ( reaction 14 in Figure S1 ) . Simulated assembly with this reaction in the mechanism was faster than that without this reaction , and the simulated half - times diverged more strongly from those observed in experiments ( Figure 7B , top panel ) . The ratios of simulated to experimental half - times , however , were closer to those observed for the FH2 domain alone . This trend might represent the limit at which nucleation from proﬁlin - actin can stimulate polymerization with FH1FH2 . For the simulated polymerization reactions in Figure 7B allowing nucleation from proﬁlin - actin , we compared the initial rates of nucleation from free actin and proﬁlin - actin to understand the contributions of both processes in mixtures of proﬁlin and actin . Low concentrations of proﬁlin strongly inhibit nucleation by free actin . The rate of nucleation from FH1 - bound proﬁ - lin - actin increases up to 10 m M total proﬁlin . The rate de - creases with higher proﬁlin concentrations , because free proﬁlin competes with proﬁlin - actin for FH1 binding sites ( Figure 7C ) . Proﬁlin - actin contributes most strongly to nucleation at 10 m M total proﬁlin , when proﬁlin - actin is w 1 . 7 times more abundant than free actin . For the max - imum strength of simulated proﬁlin - actin nucleation tested in Figure 7B , free actin and proﬁlin - actin contrib - ute to nucleation at roughly the same initial rate ( w 1 . 3 3 10 2 6 m M / s ) at 10 m M proﬁlin . One hundred micromolar total proﬁlin strongly inhibits nucleation through both pathways ( initial rates on the order of 10 2 7 m M / s ) , be - cause most of the actin is bound to proﬁlin and free proﬁlin blocks proﬁlin - actin binding to FH1 . Discussion The FH1 Domain Rapidly Transfers Proﬁlin - Actin to the Barbed End Our observations of Bni1p support the hypothesis that individual tracks of polyproline ﬁrst bind and then trans - fer proﬁlin - actin to the barbed end of ﬁlaments [ 9 , 23 ] . From a structural perspective , FH1 domains , typiﬁed by ﬂexible stretches of polypeptide interspersed with proﬁlin - binding sites , seem ideally suited to this task . Al - though multiple possible pathways are available for Figure 6 .

The reported values of concentration of endscreated by formin were obtained by subtraction of the value for the concentration of ends created through self - nucleation of actin monomers ( typically w 0 . 2 nM ; calculated from time courses of assembly of actin alone ) from the total concentration of ends . For Bni1 ( pP 1 FH2 ) p , the data point at 50 nM formin appears anomalous and is therefore not connected by a line to the rest of the data .

Proﬁlin and Formin - Mediated Actin Assembly 13 actin to add onto a barbed end associated with FH1FH2 in the presence of proﬁlin , Vavylonis et al . [ 23 ] calculated that with sufﬁcient proﬁlin , the dominant pathway involves binding of bulk - phase proﬁlin - actin to the FH1 domain , followed by movement of FH1 - bound proﬁlin - actin through space to assemble the so - called ring com - plex with the barbed end , and ﬁnally dissociation of FH1 and proﬁlin from the newly incorporated actin subunit to disassemble the ring complex and complete the elonga - tion cycle [ 23 ] . Direct delivery of proﬁlin - actin by FH1 to the barbed end is essential to account for the ability of proﬁlin to increase the rate of elongation of barbed ends associated with FH1FH2 . Mere elevation of the local concentration of proﬁlin - actin by the FH1 domain followed by release into solution near the barbed end cannot explain how much proﬁlin increases the elongation rates of barbed ends associated with FH1FH2 [ 23 ] . In a cell with a large pool of proﬁlin - actin , an FH1 do - main enables a formin to elongate ﬁlament ends rapidly . In vitro with sufﬁcient proﬁlin - actin , ﬁlaments associ - ated with Bni1p can elongate at > 100 subunits / s ( Fig - ure 4A ) , similar to rates observed with Bni1p - associated ﬁlaments emanating from the bud tip in S . cerevisiae [ 30 , 31 ] . On the basis of our data for Bni1 ( pP 8 FH2 ) p - mediated elongation in proﬁlin - actin ( Figure 4 ) , the dissociation equilibrium constant for proﬁlin - actin [ 32 ] , and the in vivo Bni1p - associated elongation rate of 110 – 180 subunits / s [ 30 ] , we estimate that the cellular proﬁlin - actin concentration near Bni1p at the bud tip is roughly 3 – 4 m M . This calculation assumes that , in vivo , Bni1p elongates barbed ends primarily through FH1 - me - diatedproﬁlin - actin transfer [ 23 ] and that ratesmeasured with Bni1 ( pP 8 FH2 ) p are similar to that of wild - type Bni1p with four polyproline tracks ( Figure 3 ) . Factors Governing the Rate of Proﬁlin - Actin Transfer by FH1 Polyproline Tracks Successive addition of up to 16 polyproline tracks to the Bni1p FH2 dimer [ i . e . , Bni1 ( pP 8 FH2 ) p ] increased the rate ofelongationofbarbedendsina‘‘dose - dependent’’man - ner up to w 30s 2 1 witha limiting concentration of proﬁlin - actin ( Figure 3 ) . Therefore , many individual FH1 proﬁlin - binding sites contribute to elongation , suggesting that each polyproline track captures proﬁlin - actin complexes independently from the bulk solution and forms FH1 - pro - ﬁlin - actin ring complexes with the barbed end [ 23 ] . The proﬁlin - actin concentration limits the rate of elon - gation of barbed ends associated with FH2 constructs both with and without FH1 domains ( Figure 4 ) . For FH1FH2 constructs , subunit transfer by FH1 is limited by binding of bulk - phase proﬁlin - actin to the FH1 do - main up to transfer rates of R 88 subunits / s , showing that the steps in the proﬁlin - actin transfer pathway that follow association of proﬁlin - actin with FH1—namely , assembly and disassembly of the ring complex—pro - ceed at rates > 88 s 2 1 ( Figure 4B ) . The rate of formin - mediated elongation increases with either the number of FH1 - proﬁlin - binding sites ( Fig - ure 3 ) or the bulk proﬁlin - actin concentration ( Fig - ure 4 ) , indicating that the density of FH1 - bound proﬁlin - actin molecules near the barbed end modulates the Figure 7 .

However , the contri - butions of individual polyproline tracks to elongation di - minishastheirtotalnumbersintheFH1domainincrease , an effect that becomes apparent at elongation rates of < 30 subunits / s when the proﬁlin - actin concentration is ﬁxed ( Figure 3 ) . Similarly , barbed ends associated with mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) containing either 6 or 14 polyproline tracks elongate at the same rate [ 9 ] . ( The criteria em - ployed in the previous study indicated that the mDia1 constructs had 5 and 11 polyproline tracks . ) This trend suggests that FH1 - bound proﬁlin - actin at polyproline tracks that are distant from the barbed end assemble ring complexes less efﬁciently than those that are closer to the barbed end . Indeed , Vavylonis et al . [ 23 ] predicted that assembly of a ring complex with a given polyproline track decreases with that track’s distance from the barbed end because the frequency of end - to - end colli - sion of a ﬂexible peptide like FH1 decreases with chain length . Thediminishedcontributionstoelongationofpol - yproline tracks at the N terminus of the FH1 domain are even more pronounced if polyproline tracks pP A and pP B bind two proﬁlin - actin complexes each ( Figure S3 ) , as is expected from their high proline content [ 26 , 27 ] . The single polyproline track pPD of Bni1 ( pP 1 FH2 ) p transfers proﬁlin - actin to the formin - associated barbed end at a rate directly proportional to the proﬁlin - actin concentration ( Figure 4B ) . High efﬁciency of transfer would explain the ability of FH1 to channel proﬁlin - actin onto the barbed end . If one assumes that proﬁlin - actin binds FH1 domains with the same association rate con - stant ( 200 m M 2 1 s 2 1 ) as proﬁlin binds polyproline [ 24 ] , the apparent second - order proﬁlin - actin transfer - rate constant of w 10 m M 2 1 s 2 1 suggests that w 5 % of proﬁ - lin - actin - binding events to pP D results in proﬁlin - actin transfer by FH1 to increase the rate of subunit addition . However , the association rate constant for proﬁlin - actin binding to the FH1 pP D track on a barbed - end - bound formin is likely to be less than the value of 200 m M 2 1 s 2 1 measured for free proﬁlin to polyproline oligomers , because of the larger sizes and restricted mobility of the binding partners . The efﬁciency of proﬁlin - actin transfer events relative to FH1 proﬁlin - actin binding events is therefore probably higher than 5 % for this pol - yproline track . Inhibition of Formin - Mediated Barbed - End Elongation by Free Proﬁlin Similar to previous ﬁndings with FH1FH2 constructs from different formins [ 9 ] , we observed the maximum rate of barbed - end elongation for the Bni1p constructs containing full or partial FH1 domains at a concentration of proﬁlin ( 2 . 5 to 5 m M ) somewhat higher than the con - centration of actin ( Figure 3A ) . This behavior supports the hypothesis that free proﬁlin competes with proﬁlin - actin for binding to FH1 polyproline tracks and thereby inhibitsproﬁlin - actintransferontothebarbedend [ 9 , 23 ] . Dissociation of Formins from Growing Barbed Ends and Translocation of Formin Translocation of an FH2 dimer from the penultimate to the terminal subunit of a growing barbed end is the only step in formin - mediated elongation that is neces - sarily dependent on subunit addition . To stay proces - sivelyassociatedwithanelongatingbarbedend , aformin must translocate in locked step with subunit addition . The direct dependence of the dissociation rate of Bni1 ( pP 8 FH2 ) p from barbed ends on the rate of subunit addition ( Figure 5 ) and a similar trend shown in previous studies of different formins [ 9 ] suggest that a formin has a much higher probability of dissociating from a ﬁlament end during some state related to translocation than dur - ing any other step in the elongation process . Indeed , translocation is a natural candidate for a process related to dissociation because a formin must partially dissoci - ate from the ﬁlament to shift its position along the grow - ing barbed end . Moreover , because subunit addition in - duces dissociation , actin - monomer association with the barbed end must precede translocation . To understand what state of formin associated with the barbed end might be related to dissociation from growing ends , we consider our results in relation to the structure of the FH2 domain of Bni1p that is associated with actin and to current models of processive associa - tion of formins with the barbed end . In the dominant con - formation of actin ﬁlaments , the subunits are rotated 167 (cid:2) relative to their neighbors along the short - pitch he - lix [ 33 , 34 ] . In contrast , association with FH2 in crystals induces a ﬁlament - like polymer of actin with subunits related to each other by a 180 (cid:2) rotation , a conformation that is not expected to allow subunit addition [ 18 ] . On the basis of this observation , Otomo et al . [ 18 ] proposed that association of a FH2 dimer with the barbed end in - duces the 180 (cid:2) conformation of the three terminal sub - units . In this state the formin is bound at all of its points of contact to actin through the so - called knob and post sites , and the barbed end is blocked for subunit addition [ 18 ] . Many researchers have proposed that in order to enable subunit addition and to simultaneously maintain contact with the barbed end , the FH2 dimer releases a fraction of its contacts to partially dissociate from the ﬁlament and translocate one of its subunits toward the barbed end . This process allows the ﬁlament to relax to the 167 (cid:2) conformation that is competent for elonga - tion [ 18 , 35 , 36 ] . Although this view might account for processive association of formins , models in which for - mins partially dissociate to translocate before subunit addition are inconsistent with our ﬁnding that subunit addition precedes translocation . Model for a Mechanical Cycle of Formin Translocation Coupled to Barbed - End Subunit Addition To explain our ﬁnding that the rate of formin dissociation from the barbed end increases with the elongation rate , we propose a model for the mechanical cycle of formin - mediated barbed - end elongation that differs from previ - ous models in the feature that the FH2 dimer advances in the barbed - end direction , or translocates , only after subunit addition ( Figure 8 and Figure S4 ) . Other models suggest that the open state of forminassociated withthe barbed end , during which subunit addition is allowed , is gated by translocation of formin along the end and the resultant relaxation of the ﬁlament to the 167 (cid:2) con - formation [ 18 , 35 , 36 ] . We propose that only relaxation of the ﬁlament without formin translocation is required for subunit addition . Our model thereby offers a novel structural interpretation of the open state of formin on Proﬁlin and Formin - Mediated Actin Assembly 15 the barbed end that is distinct from the translocation state . Figure 8A depicts the various states of association of a formin dimer with an actin ﬁlament during the process of translocation coupled to subunit addition . This sche - matic illustration is based on a space - ﬁlling model that takes into account the real dimensions of the formin and actin molecules ( Figure S4 ) . Our model provides a plausible explanation , based only on the ﬂexibilities of formin dimer and actin ﬁlament , for the energetics of formin translocation . State 1 is the closed state that pre - vents subunit addition and is identical to the blocked state proposed in [ 18 ] . The knob and post sites of both formin subunits are bound to the three terminal actin subunits of the barbed end to induce a 180 (cid:2) helical twist of these subunits . We assume that state 1 is in rapid equilibrium with state 2 , which we propose to be the open state . In state 2 , the helical twist of the three termi - nal subunits is relaxed to 167 (cid:2) , so the ﬂexible linker between the knob of the leading subunit and the post of the trailing subunit must stretch from 39 . 4 to 47 . 5 A˚ ( Figure 8B ) . We assume that this extension increases the energy of the formin bound to the end . ( The opposite linker is slightly compressed in state 2 . ) If we assume that the globular regions of each FH2 polypeptide are not distorted during any steps in the cycle , it follows that the post sites of both FH2 subunits must be disso - ciated from actin in state 2 [ 18 ] . Addition of an actin monomer to the barbed end in the open state ( step 2 , 3 ) results in a conformation with the FH2 subunits bound to actin through their knobs at the third and fourth subunits from the barbed end ( state 3 ) . In this state , the actin subunits at the tip are presumably related to the next subunit along the short - pitch helix by the standard 167 (cid:2) helical rotation . We assume that the actin subunits at the very tip of the ﬁlament are more torsionally ﬂexible than internal subunits , in which helical twists of 167 (cid:2) or less are strongly favored [ 37 ] . Internal subunits bound to formin will therefore resist the relaxation of the stretched FH2 linker . We propose that the formin barbed - end complex relieves this high - energy transition state by translocating the trailing FH2 subunit to the new terminal barbed - end subunit ( step 3 , 4 ) , where ﬂexibility of the actin subunits allows the formin to assume its lower - energy conformation . A tendency for formin to fa - vor the compliant tip position of the ﬁlament provides a rationale for processive barbed - end association and the apparent absence of translocation toward the pointed end . Given that Bni1p stays associated with barbed Figure 8 .

The 180 (cid:2) ﬁlament conformation with Bni1 ( FH2 ) p is from PDB ﬁle 1Y64 . The 167 (cid:2) conformation was modeled by overlaying the Bni1 ( FH2 ) p - actin structure with the atomic model of the actin ﬁlament ( from K . C .

Images were rendered with PYMOL ( Delano Scientiﬁc , Palo Alto , California ) . Current Biology Vol 18 No 1 16 ends growing at rates > 100 subunits / s ( Figure 4A ) , the transition state 3 preceding translocation must be very short lived . To complete the cycle of subunit addition , the knob site of the translocated formin subunit attaches to the newly added actin subunit to reestablish the open state 4 ; both post sites can then bind the ﬁlament to con - vert the complex to the closed state 5 . States 4 and 5 are equivalent to states 2 and 1 , but the ﬁlament is longer by one subunit and the orientations of the two FH2 subunits in relation to the barbed end are reversed . In our structure - based model , association of the FH2 dimer with actin is weakest during translocation , when only one strong contact binds the FH2 dimer to the barbed end . This view of a loosely bound translocation intermediate in step 3 , 4 ( Figure 8 ) is consistent with our observation ( Figure 5 ) that subunit addition followed by translocation occasionally stimulates the complete dissociation of formin from growing barbed ends . The mechanism proposed in Figure 8 also suggests that a formin might get left behind in the interior of a growing ﬁlament and be unable to inﬂuence elongation if an actin subunit were to bind to the barbed end in state 3 before the formin translocates onto the end of the ﬁlament . Our model predicts that FH2 dimers track with the long - pitch actin helix with each subunit addition . How - ever , when bound simultaneously to a formin and an en - zymatically inactive myosin , both attached to a glass slide , an elongating ﬁlament does not supercoil between the two attachment points . This observation raised the possibility that the translocating formin might ‘‘slip’’ about the ﬁlament axis [ 10 , 38 ] . The weakly bound trans - location intermediate seems like the state that is most likely to allow the formin to slip under stress . However , neither the available structures nor observations of sin - gle ﬁlaments explain how the FH2 dimer might reorient when subjected to torque . Our model for formin - mediated elongation provides a structural rationale for the variable ability of different formins to reduce barbed - end growth without proﬁlin . Our explanation draws on the hypothesis that the occu - pancy of the open state increases with the length of the ﬂexible linker connecting the knob and post sites of FH2 dimers [ 9 ] . The principle guiding our model for formin translocation coupled to subunit addition is the compe - tition between the 167 (cid:2) conformation of the formin - barbed - end complex in the open state and the 180 (cid:2) con - formation in the closed state . Whereas the actin ﬁlament favors the 167 (cid:2) conformation , the formin dimer favors the 180 (cid:2) conformation because of the energetic cost to the formin of stretching one of its FH2 linkers to at least 47 . 5 A˚ to accommodate the 167 (cid:2) conformation . Therefore , formins with longer linkers permit the open state with the 167 (cid:2) barbed - end conformation to be oc - cupied a larger fraction of the time than do those with shorter linkers . Table S2 shows the relationship between elongation in association with various well - character - ized formins and their ﬂexible linker lengths . This table also provides information on the inferred values of the differences in energy for the open and closed states for these formins , as well as the forces required to stretch their FH2 ﬂexible linkers . Romero et al . [ 11 , 39 ] proposed that ATP hydrolysis and release of the g - phosphate from the terminal barbed - end actin subunit are required for processive translocation toward the barbed end . Our mechanical model uses the binding energy of each new actin sub - unit addition , rather than a chemical reaction , to explain translocation and might account for the ability of FH2 dimers to remain associated with barbed ends growing in ADP - actin [ 9 ] . The FH1 Domain Does Not Strongly Promote Nucleation with Proﬁlin The Bni1p FH2 domain nucleates barbed ends from free actin monomers , independent of attached FH1 pro - ﬁlin - binding sites as seen previously for mDia1 [ 40 ] . At low concentrations , all of our FH1 - containing Bni1p constructs nucleated ends very efﬁciently with a yield of approximately one barbed end per formin dimer ( Figure 6B , inset ) . Similar to previous observations with mDia1 [ 40 ] , pro - ﬁlin strongly inhibits assembly stimulated by either FH2 or FH1FH2 constructs of Bni1p . Indeed , proﬁlin - actin does not contribute to nucleation by Bni1 ( FH2 ) p and is notrequired to account for nucleation by Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Figure 7 ) . On the other hand , our data do not rule out a small contribution of proﬁlin - actin to nucleation by Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p as proposed by Pring et al . [ 13 ] . Although proﬁlin strongly inhibits nucleation , cells are likely to contain much more proﬁlin - actin than free actin , so one must consider the possibility that FH1 - mediated nucleation of ends is physiologically signiﬁcant . Com - parison between our observations in solution and those in simulations suggests that at high proﬁlin concentra - tions , an FH1 - mediated proﬁlin - actin nucleation reac - tion is strongly inhibited and unlikely to proceed much faster than nucleation from the comparatively smaller pool of free actin ( Figure 7C ) . Proﬁlin - actin is therefore probably not the sole or perhaps even major source of new ends created by formin in the cell . Indeed , in live an - imal cells , a fragment containing only the FH2 domain of mDia1 is sufﬁcient for apparent association with elon - gating ﬁlaments [ 8 ] , suggesting that FH1 is not required for formin to utilize the cellular pool of actin . On the other hand , full - length Bni1p lacking only the FH1 domain could not rescue the budding - related mor - phological defects of S . cerevisiae bni1 - D cells [ 41 ] , per - turb the existing actin cytoskeleton in wild - type cells [ 42 ] , or undergo actin - polymerization - dependent disso - ciation from the cell cortex [ 30 ] . If these phenotypes do not arise from a nucleation defect , perhaps the ability of FH1 to promote elongation with proﬁlin is critical in cells . Another possibility is that Bni1p function depends on the binding of a factor other than proﬁlin to the FH1 do - main . Though no other FH1 - binding partners for Bni1p have been identiﬁed , Src tyrosine kinase binds to the FH1 domain of the formin mDia2 from mouse [ 43 ] .
