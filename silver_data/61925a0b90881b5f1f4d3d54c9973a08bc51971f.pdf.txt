When anti - clathrin heavy chain antibodies were used , the following effects were observed : clathrin became aggregated in the cytoplasm , the number of coated pits on the plasma membrane was reduced , and ad - sorbtive endocytosis of Semliki Forest virus and fluid - phase endocytosis were decreased by 40 % - 500 / b . No change in transport of newly synthesized influenza hemagglutinin to the plasma membrane was observed . The results indicated that clathrin in CV - 1 cells is in - volved in fluid - phase uptake and receptor - mediated endocytosis , but not in constitutive transport within the secretory pathway . Introduction Since their discovery , clathrin - coated pits and vesicles have been widely viewed as important organelles in the selective transport of macromolecules between mem - brane compartments . Coated pits on the cell surface are thought to concentrate receptors and receptor - ligand complexes at sites of internalization , and to participate in the formation of clathrin - coated endocytic vesicles ( for reviews see Goldstein et al . , 1979 ; Pearse and Bretcher , 1981 ) . It has been suggested that clathrin - coated mem - branes and vesicles found in association with the Golgi complex may be involved in transport of plasma mem - brane glycoproteins , secretory proteins , and lysosomal enzymes ( see Pearse and Bretcher , 1981 ; Griffiths and Si - mons , 1986 ) . Clathrin - coated vesicles have also been in - voked in membrane retrieval from granules and the plasma membrane in secretory cells , in the transcytotic transport across epithelial cells , and in transporting mem - brane to localized areas of the cell surface growth ( see Sil - verstein et al . , 1977 ; Pearse and & etcher , 1981 ; Farquhar , 1985 ; Griffiths and Simons , 1986 ) . In contrast with these views , which place clathrin at the center of membrane transport and molecular sorting , a number of reports have suggested that clathrin may not be a crucial factor in exocytic and endocytic transport . Wehland et al . ( 1981 ) reported that microinjection of affinity - purified anti - clathrin antibodies into the cytoplasm of tissue culture cells had no effect on the receptor - mediated endocytosis of a * - macroglobulin ( a ligand that is concentrated in and internalized by coated pits ) . Payne and Schekman ( 1985 ) demonstrated that yeast cells can survive without clathrin heavy chains and that secretion of invertase in these cells is virtually normal . The role of clathrin - coated membranes in the trans - golgi network as sites of departure for viral membrane glycoproteins bound for the plasma membrane has also been questioned in re - cent immunocytochemical studies ( Wehland et al . , 1982 ; Griffiths et al . , 1985 ; Orci et al . , 1986 ) . Thus , while detailed structural analysis of coated vesi - cles and clathrin rapidly progresses ( see Pearse and Crowther , 1987 ) their functional roles still remain unclear . In this study we have examined the function of clathrin using a newly developed bulk delivery technique that al - lows the introduction of anti - clathrin antibodies into the cytoplasm of living cells . We employed well - characterized monoclonal antibodies with known inhibitory action on clathrin assembly in vitro ( Blank and Brodsky , 1986 ) . Our results showed that antibodies to clathrin heavy chains ( the 180 kd subunits of the clathrin triskelions ; Pearse and Crowther , 1987 ) impaired fluid - phase uptake and adsorb - tive endocytosis of Semliki Forest virus , but did not affect the constitutive transport of newly synthesized influenza hemagglutinin ( HA ) from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane . Results Anti - Clathrin Antibodies Four monoclonal anti - clathrin antibodies of isotype IgG , and their Fab fragments were used . They were raised in mice against purified human brain clathrin , and have been extensively characterized using immunoprecipita - tion , immunoblotting , radioimmunoassays and functional in vitro assays ( Brodsky , 1985a ; Blank and Brodsky , 1986 ) . Three of the antibodies ( X19 , X35 , and X22 ) bind to clathrin heavy chains . They react with both free and polymerized clathrin triskelions , which form protein baskets ( Pearse and Crowther , 1987 ) . Antibodies X19 and X35 compete for binding to adjacent sites , whereas X22 appears to react with an independent site . All three cause extensive aggre - gation of clathrin baskets in vitro . In addition , X19 , X35 , and their Fab fragments perturb the assembly of baskets from triskelions ; they induce the formation of large mats of aggregated clathrin and other abnormal clathrin struc - tures ( Blank and Brodsky , 1986 ) . Another antibody , X16 , recognizes one of the clathrin light chain subunits ( LCa ) . It does so preferentially when LCa is dissociated from the heavy chain . The Xl6 antibody causes little aggregation of preformed clathrin baskets in vitro .

One hour after delivery , cells were fixed , permeabilized , and stained using FITC - goat anti - mouse IgG . The cytoplasm of most cells contains delivered antibody , but the phase - contrast image ( b ) reveals some cells ( see arrow heads in b ) that have not received detectable IgG . Unfused erythrocytes remaining on the ceil surface appear as fluorescent patches , ( a and b , bar = 10 urn ) . ( c ) shows the distribution of clathrin heavy chains in CV - 1 cells . Fixed and permeabilized cells were stained using X19 anti - heavy chain antibody followed by FITC - goat anti - mouse . ( d ) shows the distribution of X19 1 hr after delivery into CV - 1 cells . The delivered antibody was visualized as in ( a ) ( c and d , bar = 7 . 5 urn ) nal IgG ( anti - lghdb ; Oi et al . , 1978 ) , which has the same isotype as the test antibodies but does not react with any proteins in CV - 1 cells , was used as a control . To test the cross - reactivity of the antibodies with CV - 1 cells , immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation were performed . All three anti - heavy chain antibodies gave in - tense staining ( Figure lc ) . The pattern was similar to that previously observed for clathrin in a variety of other cell types ( Anderson et al . , 1978 ; Kartenbeck et al . , 1981 ) i . e . , discrete punctate fluorescence associated with the cell surface and concentrated fluorescence in the Golgi region . lmmunoprecipitation from [ % ] methionine - labeled lysates confirmed that these antibodies reacted with CV - 1 cell clathrin triskelions ( Figure 2 , lanes b and c ) . No detectable fluorescence was observed with X16 , the anti - light chain antibody , but in agreement with its specificity in other cell types ( Brodsky , 1985a and 1985b ) , it immunoprecipitated a small amount of LCa without associated heavy chains ( Figure 2a ) . The control antibody did not react with clathrin ( Figure 2 , lane d ) . As the effects of the Xl6 were virtually indistinguishable from that of the control IgG with respect to staining and precipitation of clathrin triskelions , it served , in effect , as a second control antibody . Method for Bulk Delivery Antibodies were introduced into the cytoplasm of living cells using a bulk delivery technique recently developed by Doxsey et al . ( 1985 ) . As recipients we used CV - 1 cells that expressed influenza virus hemagglutinin ( HA ) on their surfaces following infection with an SV40 vector con - taining the HA gene ( Gething and Sambrook , 1981 ) . Erythrocytes , loaded with antibodies by hypotonic lysis ( Rechsteiner , 1982 ) , were allowed to attach to the cell sur - face HA . The HA - mediated fusion between the mem - branes was induced by a brief drop in the pH of the medium . The resulting delivery was efficient , reproduc - ible , and virtually nondeleterious to the target ceils . Since entire cultures of cells could be processed simultane - ously , the method was well suited for biochemical studies . The efficiency of delivery was routinely monitored using three test molecules : horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) was easily visualized by cytochemistry and light microscopy , Function of Clathrin I” Endocytosis 455 MW ANTIBODY ( x163 ) Xl6 X19 X22 C 94 - 67 - - . - . - HC - LCa - LCb - * I ‘ . _ 20 . 1 - 14 . 4 - make a b c d Figure 2 lmmunoprecipitatron of Clathrin from CV - 1 Cells CV - 1 cells were labeled with [ % ] methionine and solubilized in NP40 . Clathrin was rmmunoprecipitated from the lysate with anti - light chain anhbody Xl6 ( a ) , anti - heavy chain antibodies , X19 ( b ) , and X22 ( C ) . IgG , mouse antibody ( d ) was used as a negative control . Samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and autoradiography . The large amount of rmmunoglobulin used for precipitation caused distortion of the gel rn the regions of 50 kd and 25 kd ( IgG heavy and light chains ) . The background bands seen near the 43 kd marker and between the 20 and 30 kd markers in all lanes were also caused by overloading . Xl6 precipitated LCa , while X19 and X22 precipitated clathrin heavy char” with associated LCa and LCb . The band at 70 kd corresponds to a pro - tein that often coprecrpitates with clathrin ( Brodsky , 1985b ) . It is thought to depolymerize coated vesicles ( Rothman and Schmid , 1986 ) and found in the cytoplasm of 90 % - 95 % of the target cells after delivery ( Doxsey et al . , 1985 ) . Control IgG was de - tected in the cytoplasm of about 80 % of the cells by in - direct immunofluorescence 1 hr after delivery ( Figures la and lb ) . The fluorescence staining was homogeneous throughout the cell , indicating that the antibodies were able to diffuse freely within the cytoplasm . Others have shown that diffusion of IgG through the cell is rapid and complete within 5 min at 22 % ( Wojciesyn et al . , 1981 ; Rechsteiner and Schlegel , 1986 ) . The wide range of fluorescence intensities observed in individual cells sug - gested that the number of antibodies delivered was vari - able . Pancreatic RNAase A was detected by its ability to inhibit protein synthesis in recipient cells . Incorporation of [ 35S ] methionine into protein was decreased by 90 f 5 % , indicating that the majority of cells had received the enzyme . Anti - clathrin antibodies were loaded into erythrocytes at concentrations of l - 20 mglml , which resulted in an aver - age delivery of 5 x lo5 to 10’ IgG molecules per target cell ( Doxsey et al . , 1985 ) . The Fab fragments were loaded at concentrations ( 5 mg / ml ) that ensured an average deliv - ery of at least 5 x 10” molecules per cell . ( The efficiency of erythrocyte loading increases with increasing protein concentration and decreasing molecular weight ; Rech - Steiner , 1982 . ) Solid - phase radioimmunoassay was used to estimate the number of clathrin molecules in CV - 1 cells , Our measurement of lo6 clathrin triskelions per cell was similar to that reported by Goud et al . ( 1985 ) for monkey fibroblasts . Thus the technique allows the delivery of a considerable excess of antibody over sclathrin in the cytoplasm of recipient cells . Previous studies have shown that antibodies and Fab fragments delivered into the cytoplasm of cells are very resistant to degradation with a tr / z of at least 48 hr ( McGarry et al . , 1983 ; Rechsteiner and Schlegel , 1986 ) . Effect of Anti - Clathrin Antibodies on Cell Morphology / mmunofluorescence Erythrocytes were loaded with anti - heavy chain IgG at concentrations ranging from 2 to 10 mglml to obtain an av - erage range between 1 : l and 5 : l of delivered antibody molecules to clathrin . One hour after delivery , cells were treated with neuraminidase to detach unfused erythro - cytes . The cells were then fixed with formaldehyde , per - meabilized with methanol , and stained with FITC - labeled anti - mouse IgG . All three anti - heavy chain antibodies gave similar fluorescence patterns . Cells that had obtained relatively low doses of the anti - heavy chain antibody were most informative . Fluores - cence was distributed in patches of heterogeneous size and shape throughout the cytoplasm ( Figure Id ) . Al - though smaller punctate dots were observed ( probably representing coated pits or vesicles ) , it was clear that the overall distribution was different from that observed for clathrin in control cells ( Figure lc ) . The fluorescence pat - tern suggested that the delivered antibodies caused a par - tial redistribution of intracellular clathrin . The redistribu - tion was not observed after delivery of control IgG and anti - light chain IgG . With intermediate concentrations of antibody , a pro - gressive increase in diffuse background staining was seen with no obvious change in the underlying patches and dots . Cells that received the highest concentrations of anti - clathrin antibody were very intensely stained . The fluorescence was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm , thus obscuring any specific binding pattern . Given the fact that the procedure did not allow for removal of excess unbound antibody in the cytoplasm , this “back - ground” staining pattern was to be expected . Electron Microscopy Electron microscopy of thin sections revealed several ad - ditional anomalies in cell morphology . Tlhe number of coated pits on the plasma membrane was reduced from 15 . 9 pits / mm of membrane in cells that had received con - trol antibody to 7 . 3 pits / mm in cells with X19 or X22 . Of the identifiable coated pits that remained , many were abnor - mal in shape and larger in size ( compare Figures 3a and 3d with Figures 3b , 3c , 3e , and 3f ) . In addition , clusters of up to 120 uncoated vesicles of variable sizes ( 60 - 300 nm ) were sometimes seen in the perinuclear cytoplasm ( Fig - ure 3h ) . Aside from these differences , the ultrastructure of the cells was indistinguishable from control cells . The coated membranes in the Golgi region did not appear to Cell 456 be affected , although the Golgi complexes in CV - 1 cells are relatively small and difficult to analyze quantitatively . Figure 3 . Cell Ultrastructure after Anti - Clathrin Antibody Delivery Cells containing X19 ( b , c , e , f . h ) or control IgG ( a , d , g ) were examined by electron microscopy in the presence and absence of SFV . Of the few coated pits present in the X19 containing cells , many were larger and less invaginated ( b , c , e , f ) than in control cells ( a , d ) . In addition , clusters containing several hundred noncoated vesicles of variable size ( 60 to 300 nm in di - ameter ) were occasionally found in the cyto - plasm ( h ) . In ( e ) and ( f ) , X19 - containing cells were incubated with SFV for 60 min and pro - cessed for electron microscopy . SFV was found in association with the misshapen coated pits at the surface ( e , f ) . Several viruses were often found in the same pit ( e ) , a situation rarely ob - served in control cells ( d ) . Vacuoles containing intracellular viruses were frequently found in control cells ( g ) , while only half as many were found in X19 - containing cells . ( a - f , bar = 90 nm ; g , bar = 200 nm ; h , bar = 300 nm ) . Effect of Anti - Clathrin Antibodies on Receptor - Mediated Endocytosis Uptake of Semliki Forest Virus ( SFV ) To determine whether anti - clathrin antibodies affected en - docytosis of extracellular ligands , the uptake of SFV was examined by morphological and biochemical methods . This well - characterized Toga ( a ) virus has been shown to be internalized via coated pits and coated vesicles in a va - riety of cell types ( Helenius et al . , 1980 ; Keilian and Helenius , 1986 ) . It is delivered to endosomes and finally to secondary lysosomes . The acidic pH in endosomes in - duces a conformational change in the spike glycoproteins and triggers membrane fusion and nucleocapsid penetra - tion of about 50 % of incoming viruses ( see Keilian and Helenius , 1986 ) . One hour after delivery of anti - clathrin antibodies or control antibodies , SFV was added to the extracellular medium . The cells were incubated for 60 - 120 min and processed for electron microscopy . In cells containing control antibodies ( or no antibodies ) , virus particles were found attached to the cell surface , in coated invaginations at the plasma membrane ( Figure 3d ) , and in intracellular vacuoles in the peripheral and perinuclear areas of the cell ( Figure 39 ) . In cells that had received anti - heavy chain antibodies ( X19 ) , virus particles were seen in similar loca - tions but the fraction of viruses in intracellular vacuoles was only half that found in control cells or cells containing anti - light chain antibodies ( Xl6 ; Table 1 ) . Some virus parti - cles could be seen within the abnormally shaped coated Table 1 .

Cells were then processed for electron microscopy and the average num - ber of intracellular virus particles per cellular profile was determined as described in Experimental Procedures . pits described earlier . Unlike the control cells ( Figure 3d ) , these structures frequently contained several viruses ( Fig - ure 3e ) . Considerable variation in the apparent inhibition of internalization was observed between individual cells : while a few cells appeared normal in virus uptake , others contained no internalized viruses . This heterogeneity was consistent with variation in the amount of antibody re - ceived by individual target cells ( see above ) Transport of SFV to Lysosomes Endocytic transport of SFV to lysosomes was next quanti - tated by monitoring the degradation of internalized [ W ] - methionine - labeled virus ( Marsh and Helenius , 1980 ; Marsh et al . , 1983 ) . Labeled SFV was added to the cells and aliquots of the extracellular medium were taken at var - ious times of incubation and analyzed for the presence of trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) - soluble radioactivity . In CV - 1 cells that had been fused with mock - loaded erythrocytes , soluble [ 35S ] methionine counts ( representing products of Function of Clathrin in Endocytosis 457 @ ? - 0 E E e s !

Inhibition of SFV Degradation by Anti - Clathrin Antibodies Lysosomal degradation of [ 35S ] methionine - labeled SFV was determined by measuring TCA - soluble radioactivity ( Marsh and Helenius , 1980 ) . One hour after delivery of about 5 x 1Oa IgG molecules or Fab fragments per cell , labeled SFV was added . Aliquots removed at hourly intervals were assayed for TCA - soluble radioactivity .

Values represent means and standard deviations of four independent experiments . Similar results Hours after SFV addition viral protein degradation ) , were detected 30 - 45 min after the addition of virus and increased linearly thereafter . Controls included cells incubated with virus either at 4 % ( to inhibit endocytosis ) or at 37 % in the presence of 10 uM monensin ( to elevate lysosomal pH ) . Degradation in both cases was insignificant ( Marsh et al . , 1982 ; 10 / o - 5 % of ex - perimental values ) . Thus uptake of SFV in CV - 1 cells was similar to that observed in other cell types ( Marsh and Helenius , 1980 ) except that the lag time was somewhat longer and the efficiency of degradation lower . The dif - ference can be explained by the relatively low endocytic activity of CV - 1 cells and by diminished access of virus particles to the CV - 1 cell surface in the presence of ob - structing erythrocytes . The TCA - soluble radioactivity released from cells con - taining anti - heavy chain antibody ( X19 , X22 , and X35 ) was found to be consistently lower than that released from cells that had received the same amount of control anti - body or Xl6 ( Figure 4A ) . The difference was observed when degradation was first detectable and persisted throughout the experiment . Results with all three heavy chain antibodies were identical and highly reproducible from one experiment to the next . The maximal inhibition observed was between 40 % and 55 % . Figure 5 shows SFV degradation at different levels of anti - heavy chain antibody ( X19 ) . Inhibition was detectable when an average of 5 x lo4 anti - heavy chain antibodies were delivered per cell . Maximal inhibition was reached with red cells loaded at IgG concentrations of 5 mglml . This concentration corresponded to an average delivery of 2 x lo6 IgG molecules per cell , a value roughly equivalent to the average number of clathrin molecules in CV - 1 cells . No further reduction in SFV degradation was observed at higher concentrations . Several attempts were made to increase the inhibitory effect of the anti - heavy chain antibodies on SFV endocy - tosis beyond the observed 400 / o - 55 % . Since X19 and X35 recognize epitopes distinct from X22 , mixtures of X22 and X19 ( and X35 and X19 ) were delivered . Even when loaded at combined concentrations of 30 mglml , the antibodies failed to increase inhibition beyond 50 % , suggesting that their effects were not additive . In an attempt to increase the inhibitory effect by cross - linking immune complexes in the cytoplasm , anti - clathrin heavy chain IgG and anti - were obtained with IgG and Fab fragments of the other two anti - heavy chain antibodies ( X22 and X35 ) 4 - I , . . . . . .

Inhibition of SFV Degradation of Different Antibody Doses Erythrocytes loaded with different concentrations of X19 were mixed with erythrocytes containing control antibodies so as to achieve deliv - ery of a constant number of IgG molecules ( about 5 x 10s ) but a vari - able number of X19 antibodies . The number of antibodies delivered was estimated on the basis of IgG concentrations during erythrocyte loading and previous quantitative determination ( Doxsey et al . , 1985 ) . Degradation of labeled SFV was determined as in Figure 4 . Maximal inhibition in this experiment was 45 % . mouse IgG were delivered simultaneously . The two anti - bodies were loaded into separate erythrocyte populations that were mixed before addition to cells at ratios of 1 : l to 1 : 5 . No additional effect on the rate of SFV degradation was observed . The degree of inhibition also remained un - changed when the time of SFV addition to antibody - containing cells was varied between 15 and 240 min after delivery . This indicated that the maximal effect of the anti - bodies was expressed relatively early after delivery , and that it persisted for several hours . In cells that had re - ceived anti - heavy chain Fab fragments , the amount of TCA - soluble [ 35S ] methionine radioactivity released into the medium was 25 % - 300 / o less than in cells containing control or anti - light chain Fab fragments ( Figure 48 ) . These results demonstrated that the endocytic uptake or intracellular transport of SFV to the lysosomal compart - Cdl 456 Fab 25 Figure 6 . Effect of Anti - Clathrin Antibodies on Replication of SFV One hour after delivery of antibodies or Fab fragments , SFV was added to CV - 1 cells . Two and one - half hours later , the amount of [ % l ] uri - dine incorporated into viral RNA was deter - mined . Values represent the mean values and standard deviations derived from four indepen - dent determinations . The incorporation of ra - dioactivity in cells containing control antibody ( used as 100 % to normalize the values ) was highly reproducible between experiments ( 4681 + 400 cpm ) . Control Xl6 x19 X22 Control Xl6 x19 x22 ment was inhibited by the presence of anti - clathrin heavy chain antibodies in the cytoplasm . Since only 80 % - 85 % of cells actually received antibody , one can estimate that SFV degradation was decreased by an average 60 % in the population of cells that contained antibody . Maximal inhibition was observed when the number of delivered antibodies was roughly equivalent to or higher than the number of clathrin molecules . The observation that Fab fragments displayed inhibitory activity suggested , in agree - ment with previous in vitro results ( Blank and Brodsky , 1986 ) , that the mechanism of perturbation in clathrin ac - tivity was not due to cross - linking alone . 7iansport of SFV to Endosomes To determine whether the block in SFV degradation reflected a block in the transport of SFV between the plasma membrane and endosomes , we examined the penetration of the viral genome into the cytoplasm . Previ - ous studies have shown that SFV delivers its RNA into the cytoplasm for replication by fusing the viral envelope with that of the limiting membrane of the endosome ( Marsh et al . , 1983 ; Helenius , 1984 ) . Penetration can be determined by measuring the amount of [ 3H ] uridine incorporated into viral RNA and provides an indirect assay for the efficiency of virus transport into endosomes . The results in Figure 6 show that 13H ] uridine incorporation into viral RNA was decreased by 41 % - 550 / o in the presence of anti - heavy chain IgG and 260 / o - 30 % in the presence of Fab frag - ments . This indicated that the inhibitory action of the anti - bodies was exerted at a step before the endosome and suggests that clathrin was needed to transport viruses from the cell surface to endosomes . Effect of Anti - Clathrin Antibodies on Fluid - Phase Endocytosis Our previous studies have indicated that a large propor - tion of the fluid uptake observed in tissue culture cells oc - curs by coated vesicles ( Marsh and Helenius , 1980 ) . It was therefore of interest to determine whether fluid - phase up - take was affected by the anti - clathrin antibodies . We used lucifer yellow as fluid - phase marker and quantitated its internalization spectrophotometrically ( Swanson et al . , 1985 ) . As shown in Figure 7 , uptake of the marker was , on average , 46 % lower in cells containing X19 antibody than in Cells containing control antibody . This result indicated that inhibition was not restricted to adsorbtive or receptor - mediated endocytosis , but also affected pinocytic activity of the cells . The maximum inhibitory effect on fluid - phase uptake ( Figure 7 ) was observed earlier than SFV degradation ( Figure 4 ) . The difference is explained by the lag time re - quired for fusion of virus - containing endocytic vesicles with lysosomes ( about 45 min ; Keilian and Helenius , 1986 ) and the time needed for degradation of SFV in lysosomes ( Marsh and Helenius , 1980 ) . Effect of Anti - Clathrin Antibodies on Exocytic Transport The effect of anti - clathrin heavy chain antibodies on trans - port in the exocytic pathway was monitored by the appear - ance of HAO , the uncleaved precursor of the influenza hemagglutinin , on the cell surface . Intracellular transport of HA0 in CV - 1 cells has been studied in some detail ( Geth - ing and Sambrook , 1981 ; Copeland et al . , 1986 ) . The newly synthesized HA0 follows the normal consti ! utive pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum via the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane . The efficiency of trans - port is easily determined by exposing pulse - labeled cells to trypsin at 4OC . The surface HA0 is thereby converted into mature HA , and the two subunits ( HA1 and HA2 ) are easily distinguished from HA0 after SDS - PAGE and fluo - rography ( Matlin and Simons , 1983 ) . Figure 8 shows the results obtained 1 hr after delivery of anti - light chain antibody ( Figures 8a and 8b ) , control an - tibody ( Figure 8c ) , or anti - heavy chain antibodies ( Figures 8d and 8e ) . It is apparent that the fraction of HA1 and HA2 , proteolytically generated from HAO , is similar in all sam - ples . Densitometric quantitation ( Figure 8 ) showed that in each case 51 + 5 % of the labeled HA0 was on the cell surface and was accessible for cleavage after a 45 min chase . Similar results were obtained when the transport assay was performed at earlier or later times after delivery ( Table 2 ) .

Effect of Anti - Clathrin Antibodies on Fluid - Phase Endocy - tosis One hour after delivery of X19 or control antibody ( 5 x lOa per cell ) , cells were incubated with lucifer yellow for various periods of time . The Internalized dye was quantttated and expressed as the amount of Iu - cifer yellow per mg of cellular protein . Background fluorescence in cell lysates devoid of lucifer yellow ( < I % ) , were subtracted from experi - mental values . Values represent the mean of six determinations . This result indicated that the presence of anti - clathrin antibodies in the cytoplasmic compartment had no detect - able effect on the transport of HA0 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface . When the experiment was repeated using Fab fragments of the anti - clathrin heavy chain antibodies , the results were the same ( Table 2 ) . We concluded that , while important in the receptor - mediated uptake of SFV from the cell surface and fluid - phase en - docytosis , clathrin did not play a crucial role in the exocytic transport of newly synthesized HA0 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface . TRYPSIN - + + + + ( 0 a ANTIBODY ‘i ; 0 a fl 2 : HA0 HA1 Discussion Role of Clathrin in Endocytosis The main finding in this study was that anti - clathrin heavy chain antibodies , when delivered into the cytoplasm of liv - ing cells , inhibited receptor - mediated and fluid - phase en - docytosis . They failed to affect constitutive exocytic trans - port of HA0 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane . The block in endocytosis appeared to take place at a step prior to delivery to endosomes , suggesting that it occurred at the level of the plasma membrane . Coated pits at the plasma membrane were found to be re - duced in number and altered in form . These results pro - vide biochemical evidence for a role of clathrin in the early stages of receptor - mediated and fluid - phase endocytosis . Although our data showed that clathrin is necessary for endocytosis , the molecular mechanism of inhibition is not completely clear . The antibody - induced loss of coated pits on the plasma membrane and the apparent deformation of pit structure were consistent with inhibition of coat as - HA2 abcde % HA0 cleaved : 52 47 56 48 Figure 8 .

Similar results were obtained in four inclependent experi - ments , and in three experiments where Fab fragments were used in - stead of intact IgGs . Table 2 .

( X16 , anti - light cham IgG ; X19 , X22 , anti - heavy chain IgG ) Cell 460 sembly and / or clathrin recycling . The fact that monovalent Fab fragments caused detectable inhibition indicated that the effect could not be exclusively attributed to cross - linking of clathrin and clathrin - coated structures . Our in vitro studies have shown that Fab fragments of X19 and X35 induce the formation of amorphous clumps of tri - skelions and novel geometric forms resembling incom - plete baskets ( Blank and Brodsky , 1986 ) . It is likely that , in the presence of Fab fragments , the assembly of triskel - ions into normal coated vesicles within cells is similarly impaired . Why Only 50 % Inhibition ? It is somewhat puzzling that receptor - mediated and fluid - phase endocytosis could not be inhibited by more than about 50 % in spite of various efforts to increase the effec - tiveness of the delivered reagents . The partial inhibition we observe may be for several reasons . The first reason is that only a fraction of the cells received sufficient anti - body . While the average number of antibodies delivered per cell exceeded that of clathrin , there were large differ - ences in the efficiency of delivery to individual cells . About 15 % of the cells did not receive any detectable IgG and de - livery to the rest was variable . The variability was due to uneven loading of erythrocytes and to differences in the number of erythrocytes that fused with target cells ( Doxsey et al . , 1985 ) . As a result , there was always a fraction of cells ( 15 % or above ) that did not contain a critical , inhibitory dose of antibody . Our studies have indicated that three IgG molecules or nine Fab fragments are required per triskelion to induce the maximum morphological effects on clathrin assembly in vitro ( Blank and Brodsky , 1986 ) . Such molar ratios were probably achieved in only a frac - tion of the recipient cells . The second reason for incom - plete inhibition could be that antibodies to clathrin were in - capable of completely inhibiting clathrin function in the cytoplasm of the living cell . Other systems in which the ef - fects of monoclonal antibodies on cellular function have been studied include inhibition of lymphocyte recognition and neural cell adhesion ( Sanchez - Madrid et al . , 1982 ; Keilhauer et al . , 1985 ) . The inhibitory effects ranged from 200 / o - 70 % . When anti - fodrin antibodies were delivered into the cytoplasm of chromaffin cells , maximum inhibition was 55 % ( Perrin et al . , 1987 ) . The inhibition that we have observed is thus well within the range observed by others . The apparent inefficiency of a variety of antibodies in blocking the functions of their antigens in the living cell may be due to competition with other molecular and cellu - lar interactions . The third reason , an increase in clathrin biosynthesis , seems unlikely because we observe a fairly constant level of inhibition over the 4 hr time period stud - ied ( Figure 4 ) even after delivery of 5 - to lo - fold excess of anti - clathrin antibody over clathrin . Finally , a fraction of viruses and fluid - phase material may have entered CV - 1 cells by a pathway independent of clathrin . Clathrin - inde - pendent endocytosis of viruses , receptor - bound ligands , and fluid - phase material have been proposed in several studies ( see Mellman et al . , 1986 ) , but the contribution of these pathways to overall endocytosis in the cell remains unclear . The partial inhibition of endocytosis observed in this study may explain the apparent discrepancy between our results and those of Wehland et al . ( 1981 ) , who found no effect of anti - clathrin antibodies on receptor - mediated en - docytosis . The qualitative immunofluorescence assay used by Wehland and co - workers to determine uptake of a * - macroglobulin may not have been sensitive enough to detect a partial inhibitory effect . The antiserum - derived antibodies used in their study were primarily directed against light chains and did not induce redistribution of native clathrin in the cells . This is consistent with our studies using the light chain antibody X16 , which had no apparent effect on endocytosis in our assays . Role of Clathrin in the Secretory Pathway The fact that synthesis and transport of newly synthesized HA0 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma mem - brane was unaffected in this study is in keeping with find - ings from other groups . Payne and Schekman ( 1985 ) re - cently showed that deletion of the gene for the clathrin heavy chain in yeast had little effect on secretion of newly synthesized invertase from the cells . The yeast cells were able to survive , although they grew more slowly than wild - type cells . Griffiths et al . ( 1985 ) and others ( Wehland et al . , 1982 ; Orci et al . , 1986 ) using immunolabeling tech - niques , have shown that a constitutively transported viral membrane glycoprotein ( G protein ) is not localized to clathrin - coated membranes in the Golgi complex . Con - trary to earlier beliefs , it is increasingly apparent that the clathrin - coated vesicles in the Golgi region may not be in - volved in the constitutive pathway to the cell surface . This contention is supported by our results on HA0 transport . No difference in the rate of HA0 transport could be detected in cells containing anti - clathrin antibodies and control antibodies . The functional role of clathrin and clathrin - coated vesicles in the Golgi complex therefore re - mains an open question . It has been suggested that they may be involved in shuttling of membrane between the trans Golgi network and endosomes and lysosomes ( Schulze - Lohoff et al . , 1985 ; also see Griffiths and Si - mons , 1986 , and Farquhar , 1985 ) . Studies are in progress to determine whether the transport of lysosomal mem - brane proteins and hydrolases is compromised by cyto - plasmic delivery of anti - clathrin heavy chain antibodies . Experimental Procedures Cells and Viruses African green monkey kidney cells ( CV - 1 cells ) were grown I” Dul - becco’s modified essential medium with 10 % fetal calf serum ( com - plete DMEM ) and plated in 35 mm wells ( 7 x lo4 cells / well ) or on 12 mm coverslips ( 2 x 10“ ) for experiments ( Doxsey et al . , 1985 ) . HA was expressed in the cells by infection with an SV40 vector containing a cDNA coding for HA ( SVEHAS ; Gething and Sambrook , 1981 ; Doxsey et al . , 1985 ) . Unlabeled and [ % ] methionine - labeled SFV was propa - gated in baby hamster kidney ( SHK - 21 ) cells and purified as descrrbed ( Marsh and Helenius , 1980 ) . Anti - Clathrin Antibodies and Fab Fragments Four mouse monoclonaf anti - clathrin antibodies ( IgG , isotype ) were used . They were raised against human brain clathrin and have been characterized in detail elsewhere ( Brodsky , 1985a ; Blank and Brodsky . 1966 ) . All four are of the IgG , isotype X19 , X22 , X35 recognize Funcbon of Clathrin in Endocytosis 461 clathrin heavy chains and Xl6 binds to the LCa light chain preferen - tlally when it is not associated with heavy chain . The antibody 11 - 6 . 3 ( Oi et al . , 1978 ) , which recognizes the mouse immunoglobulin allotype Ighdb , was used as a control antibody since it does not react with CV - 1 cells and is an IgG , . Antibodies were purified from ascites fluid ( Parham et al . , 1982 ) and Fab fragments were prepared as previously described ( Parham , 1986 ) . Antibodies and Fab fragments were con - centrated to 2 - 20 mg / ml using a Centricon concentrating device or a stirred cell concentrator ( Amicon ) and dialysed into 10 mM Tris before loading into erythrocytes ( Doxsey et al . , 1985 ) . Bulk Delivery of Macromolecules into Cells The protocol for introducing macromolecules into living cells was as previously described ( Doxsey et al . , 1985 ) . Briefly , the precursor HA0 molecule was expressed on the surface of CV - 1 cells by infection with the SV40 vector ( see above ) . Approximately 44 hr later , cells were tryp sinized to produce the fusion - active HA molecule . Erythrocytes were loaded by hypotonic lysis ( Aechsteiner , 1982 ) with antibodies ( I - 20 mg / ml ) , Fab fragments ( 5 mg / ml ) , RNAase A ( 20 mglml , boiled 15 min before use ) , horseradish peroxidase ( HRP , 40 mglml ) , or buffer alone ( mock - loaded ) . Unless otherwise specified , antibodies were loaded at IO - 20 mglml . The red cells were allowed to bind to target cells and the pH of the medium was lowered to 4 . 8 for 2 min to trigger fusion between erythrocyte and cell membranes and hence the delivery of the macro - molecules into the cytoplasm . Most assays described in these studies were performed 1 hr after delivery . Morphological Techniques Distribution of clathrin in CV - I cells was determined by indirect immu - nofluorescence as follows . Cells on 12 mm coverslips were fixed in 3 % formaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) for 15 min and per - meabilized in methanol at 22OC . Cells were incubated with anti - clathrin antibodies ( 20 - 50 bglml ) , then with FITC goat anti - mouse IgG and mounted as described ( Doxsey et al . , 1985 ) . To assess the efficiency of delivery , HRP and IgG were introduced into target ceils and localized bydiaminobenzidinecytochemistryand immunofluorescence , respec - tively ( Doxsey et al . , 1985 ) . To examine coated pits at the plasma membrane , cells were processed for transmission electron microscopy 1 hr after delivery of the anti - clathrin antibodies as described ( Doxsey et al . , 1985 ) . Thin sections were cut perpendicular to the cell monolayer and examined in a Philips EM300 electron microscope . The number of coated pits on the surface of cells containing control antibodies or anti - heavy chain antibodies was determined as previously described ( Anderson et al . , 1978 ; Larkin et al . , 1983 ) . In each case , approximately IO mm of plasma membrane was surveyed from two separate experiments . To study the uptake of SFV in cells containing anti - clathrin antibodies , cells were in - cubated with virus ( 20 - 40 fig protein / 32 mm plate ) for 1 hr at 37oC , then processed for electron microscopy . The number of intracellular viruses was counted in at least 75 cellular profiles from two separate experi - ments . Only cells sectioned through the center of the nucleus were examined . SFV Degradation Assay SFV degradation in lysosomes was determined as described ( Marsh and Helenius , 1980 ; Marsh et al . , 1983 ) . One hour after antibody deliv - ery , cells ( on 35 mm dishes ) were washed in RPMI - 1640 with 0 . 2 % bo - vine serum albumin ( BSA ) and 10 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethel ) - 1 - piperazine ethane sulphonic acid ( HEPES ) [ pH 6 . 8 ] ( R - medium ) . Cells were then incubated with [ 35S ] methionine - labeled SFV ( 2 x106 cpm / dish , with 0 . 1 - 0 . 25 pg cold SFV / well ) in 1 . 2 ml of R - medium at 37oC in a nonCOp incubator . At the times indicated , 0 . 3 ml of the medium was collected , made 10 % with TCA , and kept on ice for 1 hr . Tubes were spun for 5 min in a microfuge ( Brinkmann Instrument Co . , Westbury , NY ) , super - natants were added to 5 ml scintillation fluid ( Optifluor ) , and radioactiv - ity counted using a Beckman LS 7500 counter . SFV Replication Assay Replication of viral RNA was assayed essentially as described previ - ously for BHK cells ( Helenius et al . , 1982 ) . One hour after delivery of anbbodies , cells on 12 mm coverslips were washed with 1 ml of R - medium . The solution was replaced with 0 . 25 ml of medium contain - ing SFV ( moi of 200 ) and cells were incubated in a non - COP incubator at 3PC for 2 . 5 hr . Actinomycin Cl ( 3 pglml ) m R - medium was added to cells to inhibit cellular RNA synthesis . Thirty minutes later , cells were incubated in the same medium containing 3 - 5 PCi [ 3H ] uridine / well for 2 hr . Coverslips were washed extensively with ice - cold PBS containing IO mM uridine and TCA - precipitable material was counted . Back - ground values , represented by cells incubated in virus - free medium or cells incubated with virus in the presence of monensin to inhibit penetration of the viral genome into the cytoplasm ( Marsh et al . , 1982 ) were IO % - 20 % of experimental values . An moi of 200 was used in these studies since it gave maximal 13H ] uridine incorporation in stan - dard curves ( not shown ) . Higher moi’s did not resull in higher uridine incorporation . All determinations , including standard curves and virus - free backgrounds , were performed in quadruplicate . Fluid - Phase Uptake Fluid - phase uptake was measured usmg lucifer yellow ( LY ; Swanson et al . , 1985 ) . One hour after antibody delivery , cells in 32 mm dishes were incubated with LY ( 1 mg / ml in complete DMEM ) . At various times , cells were washed five times with PBS at 4OC , then lysed in 0 . 05 % Nonidet P40 ( NP40 ) for 30 min at 4OC . Background values represented by cells that were unexposed to LY were subtracted . Fluorescence was measured using a Perkin - Elmer LS - 5 fluorescence spectrophotome - ter . ( Excitation wavelength = 430 nm , emitted wavelength = 540 nm ) . Tryptic Cleavage of Cell Surface HA0 The appearance of pulse - labeled HA0 on the cell surface was detected by proteolytic cleavage ( Matlin and Simon ? , , 1983 ; Copeland et al . , 1986 ) . One hour after delivery , cells grown In 35 mm dishes were washed in 1 ml of methionine - free medium for 10 min at 37oC . Cells were pulse - labeled with [ s5S ] methiomne ( 100 - 150 PCi in 0 . 6 ml / dish ) for 5 min in methionine - free medium then ‘ < chased” in DMEM contain - ing IO mM methionine at 37oC for various periods of time . The chase period for most experiments was 45 min , although longer times were also used ( Table 2 ; for the 120 min time point the chase time was 65 min , for the Fab’s the chase was 55 min ) . After the chase period , cells were washed with PBS , placed on ice , and treated with ice - cold trypsin ( 100 pglml , tosylamidephenylethylchloromethyl ketone ( TPCK ) - treated ) for 30 min at 4°C to cleave HA0 into two disulfide - linked pep - tides , HA1 and HA2 . Soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to a final concentration of 500 Kg / ml , and IO min later cells were washed twice in PBS then lysed in NP40 ( 0 . 5 % ) in PBS with 2 rnM EDTA . 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0 . 1 U / ml aprotinin for 15 min at 4OC . Lysates were used for immunoprecipitation immediately or frozen and stored at - 20°C . lmmunoprecipitation of Clathrin , HAO , and HA lmmunoprecipitation of clathrin from [ ? S ] methionlne - labeled ( 4 hr ) CV - I cell lysates was done using preformed immune complexes as pre - viously described ( van Agthoven et al . , 1981 ; Brodsky , 1985b ) . For im - munoprecipitation of HA , 1 VI of polyclonal anti - serum against in - fluenza virus ( Jap strain , C . Copeland , Yale University ) was added to 200 ~ 1 of cell lysate and incubated for 1 hr at 4OC . Goat anti - rabbit IgG ( IO Kg ) was added and 1 hr later , lysates were incubated with 100 PI of a 10 % suspension of fixed Staphylococcus aureus at 4OC with con - tinuous agitation for 1 hr . The immunoprecipitated material was washed in high - salt and detergent buffers as described ( Mellman et al . , 1980 ) . Pellets were resuspended in sample buffer ( 200 mM Tris [ pH 6 . 81 , 3 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , 20 mM dithiothreitol , and 0 . 004 % bromophenol blue ) and boiled for 3 - 5 min . The S . aureus was pelleted and samples were subjected to SDS - PAGE ( Laemmli , 1970 ) . Fluorog - raphy and densitometry of gel bands were performed as described ( Copeland et al . , 1986 ) . Solid - Phase Radioimmunoassay To determine the number of clathrin molecules in CV - 1 cells , solid - phase radioimmunoassays were performed ( Brodsky and Parham , 1983 ) . Monoclonal antibody X22 ( at 100 nglml ) was preincubated with dilutions of CV - 1 cell lysates ( IO7 cells solubilized in 1 ml of IO mM Tris [ pH 8 . 01 , 150 mM NaCI , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA ) , then tested for bind - ing to purified clathrin applied to a polyvinyl chloride plate . Binding was detected using [ ‘251 ] enti - immunoglobulin . The degree of inhibition of X22 binding by lysate was correlated with a standard csurve of inhibition by purified clathrin . Cell 462 Other Methods [ % ] methionine labeling of cells after delivery of RNAase was as for HA0 ( above ) . Cells were then washed , lysed . and TCA precipitates were either subjected to SDS - PAGE , fluorography and densitometry , or counted directly .

San Francisco , CA ) ; TPCK - trypsin , protease inhibitors , DAB , HRP ( neuraminidase ( type V ) , pancreatic RNAase A and lucifer yellow were from Sigma ( St .
