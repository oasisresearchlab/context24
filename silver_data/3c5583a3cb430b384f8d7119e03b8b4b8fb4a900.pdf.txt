Ecotropic MLV ( Eco - MLV ) infects mouse and rat cells . Amphotropic MLV ( Ampho - MLV ) infects many types of mammals including mouse , rat , mink , and human . The Eco - and Ampho - MLVs recognize cationic amino acid transporter 1 ( CAT1 ) [ 1 ] and phosphate symporter 2 ( Pit2 ) [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] as the infection receptors , respectively . Polytropic ( Poly - ) and xenotropic ( Xeno - ) MLVs both utilize the cell surface receptor protein XPR as the infection receptor [ 5 , 6 , 7 ] . The Poly - and Xeno - MLVs infect many types of mammals ; however , the latter does not infect laboratory mice . The MLV entry into the host cell cytoplasm occurs through membrane fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes . This membrane fusion is induced by viral envelope ( Env ) glycoproteins . The MLV Env protein has 16 - amino acids at its C - terminal tail that is cleaved during virion maturation . The C - terminal proteolytic fragment is referred to as the R peptide . The R peptide - truncated Eco - MLV Env protein induces membrane fusion , while the full - length Env protein lacks this activity , indicating that the R peptide inhibits membrane fusion [ 8 , 9 , 10 ] . This membrane fusion activity enables proteolytically cleaved Env - expressing cells to fuse with neighboring susceptible cells , which may reflect the viral entry process . Endosomal acidification also plays a role in the MLV infectious cycle . The Eco - and Ampho - MLV infections are suppressed by endosome acidification inhibitors that induce a rise in the pH of endosomes , showing that these viral infections require endosome acidification and occur through acidic endosomes [ 11 , 12 ] . However , it has not been elucidated to date whether infections by the Poly - and Xeno - MLVs occur through acidic endosomes . A potential mechanism explaining the requirement for endosome acidification has recently been reported . Endosomal cathepsin proteases B and L are involved in the Eco - MLV infection [ 13 , 14 ] , and the cathepsin proteases are activated by low pH in acidic endosomes . Therefore , endosome acidification inhibitors may suppress the Eco - MLV infection by attenuating cathepsin protease activation . It is unknown whether cathepsins B and L play a role ( s ) in the Ampho - , Poly - and Xeno - MLV infections . XC cells were established from a rat muscle tumor induced by Rous sarcoma virus [ 15 ] , and are widely used to titrate Eco - MLVs , as the number of plaques resulting from the Eco - MLV - induced cell - cell fusion correlates with the viral titer [ 16 ] . It is PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 October 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 10 | e26180 thought that the mechanism of Eco - MLV entry into rat XC cells is distinct from other susceptible cells . pH - independent cell - cell fusion is induced in XC cells by the Eco - MLV infection [ 16 ] , or by the R peptide - containing Eco - MLV Env protein [ 17 , 18 ] , but not in other susceptible cells . In addition , ammonium chloride , which increases the pH of endosomes , inhibits the Eco - MLV infection in many susceptible cells , but not in XC cells , indicating that the Eco - MLV infection in XC cells is independent of low pH in endosomes [ 11 ] . Therefore , it is generally accepted that the Eco - MLV enters XC cell at the plasma membrane , and enters other susceptible cells through acidic endosomes [ 11 , 19 ] . In this study , we investigated whether the Poly - , Xeno - , and XMRV - MLV vector infections occur through acidic endosomes and whether these infections require cathepsin protease activity . We also examined the pH - independent mechanism of MLV infections in XC cells . We found that the Poly - Xeno - , and XMRV - MLV vector infections occur through acidic endosomes and require cathepsin proteases similar to the Eco - MLV , Ampho - MLV , and Ebola virus infections . The endosome acidification inhibitors attenuated all these viral infections in NIH3T3 and TE671 cells , but had no effect in XC cells , as previously shown [ 11 ] . The endosome acidification inhibitors attenuated cathepsin protease activities in TE671 cells , but had no effect in XC cells , indicating that cathepsin proteases are activated without endosome acidification in XC cells . Suppression of endocytosis by a dynamin GTPase inhibitor , dynasore , or by siRNA - mediated knockdown of dynamin 2 expression attenuated the MLV infections in all cells examined ( including XC cells ) , showing that these infections occur through endosomes even in XC cells . These results show that cathepsin proteases are activated in the absence of endosome acidification in XC cells and that pH - independent virus infections occur through endo - somes in these cells . Results Eco - MLV infection of XC cells is independent of endosomal acidification Ammonium chloride , which acts as a weak base and inhibits the acidification of endosomes , attenuates the Eco - MLV infection in NIH3T3 cells but not in XC cells [ 11 ] . This result suggests that the Eco - MLV entry into XC cells occurs at the plasma membrane and does not depend on endosome acidification . To test whether endosome acidification is required for the Eco - MLV infection in XC cells , we monitored the effects of concanamycin A ( ConA ) and bafilomycin A - 1 ( BFLA - 1 ) on this process . MLV vectors carrying LacZ gene as a marker were pseudotyped with various viral envelope glycoproteins as described in Materials and Methods . Mouse NIH3T3 , rat XC , and human TE671 cells expressing the Eco - MLV receptor ( TE671 / mCAT1 ) [ 14 ] were pretreated with the inhibitors for 5 h , and were inoculated with the Eco - or VSV - pseudotyped MLV vector diluted with fresh medium in absence of the inhibitor to minimize the effects on other steps of the MLV vector infection than entry ( such as uncoating and reverse transcription ) . Treatment of NIH3T3 and TE671 / mCAT1 cells with the inhibitors attenuated the Eco - and VSV - MLV vector infections ( Fig . 1A ) . The treatment of XC cells inhibited the VSV - MLV vector infection , indicating that the treatment with ConA or BFLA - 1 inhibited endosome acidification in XC cells . However , the treatment of XC cells did not attenuate the Eco - MLV vector infection as reported [ 11 ] . These results show that the Eco - MLV infection in XC cells does not require endosome acidification , while NIH3T3 and TE671 / mCAT1 cells require endosome acidification for the infection . XC cells are a rat cell line . We analyzed the effect of ConA treatment on the Eco - MLV infection in other rat cell lines ( F10 and L6 ) as well as a mouse cell line ( SC - 1 ) . The ConA treatment of all these cell lines efficiently inhibited the Eco - MLV vector infection ( Fig . 1B ) , indicating that XC cells are unique cells in which the Eco - MLV infection is pH - independent . We have already analyzed the effects of a cathepsin protease inhibitor , CA - 074Me , on the Eco - MLV infection in NIH3T3 , XC , and TE671 / mCAT1 cells , and reported that the treatment efficiently and similarly suppresses the Eco - MLV vector infection , but moderately attenuated the VSV - MLV vector infection [ 14 ] . These results indicate that the Eco - MLV infection in XC cells does not require endosome acidification , but does cathepsin proteases . Conditioned media induce pH - independent infection in NIH3T3 cells It has been postulated that secreted cathepsins are involved with the pH - independent Eco - MLV infection in XC cells [ 13 ] . To assess the hypothesis , we analyzed the effects of conditioned media of XC , NIH3T3 , NP2 , and TE671 cells on the pH - dependent MLV infection in NIH3T3 cells . Optimal condition of cathepsin B and L activities is acidic . Culture supernatants of XC and TE671 cells were both yellow , suggesting that pH values of the supernatants are low . However , during dilution of the MLV vector with the conditioned media , the diluted MLV vector solution rapidly became red . pH values of the MLV vectors diluted with the conditioned media were 6 . 5 to 7 . 0 , when the vectors were inoculated to target cells . Dilution of the Eco - MLV vector with the conditioned media of XC , NIH3T3 , TE671 , and NP2 cells attenuated the infection by about 1 / 10 ( data not shown ) . When the MLV vector was diluted with the XC cell conditioned medium , the inhibitory effect of ConA on the Eco - MLV infection in NIH3T3 cells was diminished ( Fig . 2A ) . The conditioned media of TE671 and NIH3T3 cells , in which the Eco - MLV infection is pH - dependent ( Fig . 1A ) , also induced pH - independent infection in NIH3T3 cells . However , the TE671 cell conditioned medium did not abrogate the inhibitory effect of ConA on the VSV - MLV vector infection . XC and TE671 cells indeed secreted cathepsins B and L ( Fig . 2B ) . When cathepsin B activity of the conditioned media was measured at pH 7 . 0 , fluorescence intensities of the XC and TE671 cell conditioned media were reduced to about 1 / 3 time compared with those at pH 5 . 0 , but were still higher than that of fresh medium . Cathepsin L activity of these conditioned media at pH 7 . 0 was moderately lower than that at pH 5 . 0 , and was higher than that of fresh medium . These results indicate that cathepsins B and L are active at pH 7 . 0 in the conditioned media , and suggest that secreted cathepsins in the conditioned media induce the pH - independent Eco - MLV vector infection in NIH3T3 cells . However , even when the Eco - MLV vector was diluted with fresh medium , ConA did not attenuate the Eco - MLV infection in XC cells ( Figs . 1A and 2A ) . Furthermore , the conditioned media of NIH3T3 , NP2 , and TE671 cells , in which the Eco - MLV infection is pH - dependent , also induced the pH - independent Eco - MLV infection ( Fig . 2A ) . Additionally , cathepsin B activity of the TE671 cell conditioned medium was higher than those of the XC cell conditioned medium ( Fig . 2B ) . If secreted cathepsin proteases are determinant for the XC cell - specific , pH - independent Eco - MLV infection , the endosome acidification inhibitors would not suppress the Eco - MLV infection in TE671 cells . However , the inhibitors significantly attenuated the Eco - MLV infection in TE671 cells ( Figs . 1A and 2A ) . These results indicate that secreted cathepsins are not involved in the XC cell - specific , pH - independent Eco - MLV infection . pH - Independent Infection by MLV in XC Cells PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 October 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 10 | e26180 Secreted cathepsin proteases induce pH - independent Eco - MLV infection in NIH3T3 cells The above results suggested that conditioned media induce the pH - independent Eco - MLV infection by secreted cathepsin proteases . To assess this assumption , we analyzed the effects of purified cathepsin B ( 100 ng / ml ) on the pH - dependent Eco - MLV infection in NIH3T3 cells . It has been reported that addition of cathepsin B at similar concentration enhances the Eco - MLV infection in cathepsin B - negative cells [ 13 ] . Although addition of cathepsin B reduced the Eco - MLV vector infection by about 1 / 5 ( data not shown ) , it diminished the inhibitory effect of ConA on the Eco - MLV vector infection in NIH3T3 cells ( P , 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 3A ) . This result shows that addition of cathepsin B induces the pH - independent Eco - MLV infection in NIH3T3 cells . To address whether the conditioned medium abrogates the inhibitory effect of ConA on the Eco - MLV infection by secreted cathepsins , we analyzed the effects of cathepsin inhibitor III suppressing both cathepsins B and L on the conditioned medium - induced pH - independent Eco - MLV infection in NIH3T3 cells . ConA - pretreated NIH3T3 cells were inoculated with the Eco - MLV vector diluted with the TE671 cell conditioned medium in presence of cathepsin inhibitor III . Cathepsin inhibitor III at 200 m M significantly suppressed the induction of pH - independent infection by the conditioned medium ( Fig . 3B ) . Because cathepsin inhibitor III is not membrane permeable , the treatment of target cells at 200 m M did not attenuate infection of NIH3T3 cells by the Eco - MLV vector diluted with fresh medium ( Fig . 3C ) . Cathepsin inhibitor III indeed attenuated activities of cathepsin proteases B and L in the TE671 cell conditioned medium ( Fig . 3D ) . We have previously reported that a membrane unpermeable cathepsin L inhibitor , CLIK148 , attenuates the Eco - MLV infection at 1000 m M [ 14 ] , suggesting that much higher concentration of the unpermeable cathepsin inhibitor III is required for inhibition of the Eco - MLV vector infection than the permeable cathepsin inhibitor CA - 074Me . These results indicate that secreted cathep - sin proteases present in the conditioned media induce the pH - independent Eco - MLV infection in NIH3T3 cells . Secreted cathepsins are not involved in the XC cell - specific , pH - independent Eco - MLV infection Even when the Eco - MLV vector was diluted with fresh medium , the Eco - MLV vector infection was pH - independent in XC cells . To assess whether cathepsins secreted from XC cells are involved in the XC cell - specific , pH - independent Eco - MLV infection , we analyzed the effect of cathepsin inhibitor III on the infection of XC cells by the Eco - MLV vector diluted with fresh medium . XC cells were inoculated with the diluted Eco - MLV vector , in the presence of cathepsin inhibitor III ( 200 m M ) . However , cathepsin inhibitor III did not affect the infection of XC cells by the Eco - MLV vector diluted in fresh medium ( Fig . 3C ) . When we proposed that secreted cathepsins induce the pH - independent Eco - MLV infection in XC cells , we thought that the Eco - MLV infection would occur at the plasma membrane in XC cells . However , since cathepsin inhibitor III attenuated the cathepsin activity in the TE671 cell conditioned medium ( Fig . 3D ) , but did not affect the Eco - MLV infection in XC cells , the Eco - MLV infection in the treated XC cells probably occurs through a different pathway than cell surface entry . It is most likely Figure 1 . Eco - MLV infection in XC cells is independent of endosome acidification .

Since CA - 074Me significantly inhibited the Eco - MLV vector infection in XC cells [ 14 ] , the Eco - MLV infection does not occur through a cathepsin - independent pathway ( s ) . Therefore , cathepsin inhibitor III should confer the Eco - MLV infection pathway from the cell surface to the acidic endosomes , and thus no change in the Eco - MLV vector titers Figure 3 .

To assess whether the Eco - MLV infection of XC cells in the presence of cathepsin inhibitor III occurs through acidic endosomes , ConA - pretreated XC cells were inoculated with the Eco - MLV vector in the presence of cathepsin inhibitor III . However , the treatment of XC cells did not attenuate the Eco - MLV infection ( Fig . 3C ) , showing that the Eco - MLV infection of XC cells in the presence of cathepsin inhibitor III does not require endosome acidification . Taken together , these results indicate that the assumption is not correct , and suggest that secreted cathepsins are not involved in the XC cell - specific , pH - independent Eco - MLV infection . Ampho - , Poly - , Xeno - , and XMRV - MLV vector infections occur through acidic endosomes and require cathepsin proteases in TE671 cells It has already been reported that endosome acidification inhibitors attenuate the Eco - and Ampho - MLV infections , suggesting that these infections occur through acidic endosomes [ 11 , 12 ] . To assess whether the Poly - , Xeno - , and XMRV - MLV vector infections occur through acidic endosomes , the effects of endosome acidification inhibitors , ConA and BFLA - 1 , on these MLV vector infections were analyzed . Human TE671 cells were pretreated with these inhibitors for 5 h , and were inoculated with the MLV vectors in absence of the inhibitors . All of these MLV vector infections were efficiently attenuated by the ConA ( Fig . 4A ) or BFLA - 1 treatment ( Fig . 4B ) . The BFLA - 1 treatment of TE671 cells expressing human CD4 did not affect infection by an HIV - 1 vector carrying the Env protein of the CXCR4 - tropic HXB2 HIV - 1 strain . The ConA treatment enhanced the transduction efficiency of this virus as previously reported [ 20 , 21 ] , suggesting that the HIV - 1 vector infection do not require endosome acidification , and attenuation of the MLV infections by the inhibitors is not due to their suppressing effect on cell viability . These findings indicate that the Ampho - , Poly - , Xeno - , and XMRV - MLV vector infections all require endosome acidification in human TE671 cells . The Eco - MLV infection requires endosomal cathepsin prote - ase B or L [ 13 , 14 ] . To assess whether the Ampho - , Poly - , Xeno - , and XMRV - MLV vector infections also require cathepsin proteases , the effect of CA - 074Me on these MLV vector infections were analyzed . CA - 074Me is membrane permeable and inhibits both cathepsins B and L [ 14 , 22 ] . TE671 cells were pretreated with CA - 074Me for 5 h , and were inoculated with the MLV vectors diluted with fresh medium . The MLV vector infections were efficiently attenuated by CA - 074Me in a dose - dependent manner , but the VSV - G - MLV vector infection was not significantly inhibited ( Fig . 4C ) . Biochemical study also revealed that the CA - 074Me treatment indeed attenuated cellular cathepsin B activity in TE671 cells ( Fig . 4D ) . These results indicate that the Eco - , Ampho - , Poly - , Xeno - , and XMRV - MLV vector infections of TE671 cells occur through acidic endosomes and require cathepsin proteases . pH - independent MLV infection in XC cells requires endosomal cathepsin proteases The Eco - MLV infection of XC cells does not require endosome acidification . To assess whether the Ampho - , Poly - , Xeno - , and XMRV - MLV vector infections of XC cells also lack this requirement , the effect of ConA on these MLV vector infections was analyzed . While ConA treatment did not inhibit these MLV infections in XC cells ( Fig . 4E ) , it did inhibit the VSV - MLV infection , indicating that the ConA treatment suppressed endo - some acidification . These results indicate that the Eco - , Ampho - , Poly - , Xeno - , and XMRV - MLV vector infections of XC cells are all independent of endosome acidification . If the MLV infections of XC cells do not occur through acidic endosomes , it may not require cathepsin proteases , because secreted cathepsins are not involved in the pH - independent infection of XC cells and these proteases primarily exist in acidic endosomes . However , CA - 074Me treatment inhibited the Eco - MLV infection in XC cells as well as in NIH3T3 cells [ 14 ] . The Ampho - , Poly , Xeno - , and XMRV - MLV infections in XC cells were also suppressed by CA - 074Me ( Fig . 4F ) . CA - 074Me treatment indeed decreased cathepsin B activity in XC cells to that in untreated NIH3T3 cells in which cathepsin B activity is negative or extremely low [ 14 ] ( Figs . 4D and G ) . These results suggest that the MLV infections in XC cells are pH - independent but require endosomal cathepsin proteases . Cathepsin proteases are activated in the absence of endosome acidification in XC cells Because cathepsin proteases are activated by low pH in acidic endosomes [ 23 ] , endosome acidification inhibitors may inhibit MLV infections by suppressing cathepsin protease activation . To address this hypothesis , the effect of ConA treatment on activities of cathepsins B and L in living cells were measured . ConA treatment attenuated cathepsin B ( Fig . 5A ) and L ( Fig . 5B ) activities in TE671 cells ( P , 0 . 05 ) , but did not in XC cells , suggesting that cathepsin proteases are activated without endo - some acidification in XC cells . Cathepsin B and L proteases are maturated by their processing in acidic condition . To assess whether the acidification inhibitor affects the cathepsin protease processing , Western immunoblotting of cell lysates prepared from ConA - or DMSO - treated cells was performed using an anti - mouse cathepsin L antibody . In mouse NIH3T3 and rat L6 cells in which the Eco - MLV infection is pH - dependent ( Fig . 1B ) , levels of the cathepsin L precursor and processed single chain proteins were elevated and reduced by the ConA treatment , respectively , indicating that the ConA treatment suppresses the cathepsin L processing . In contrast , levels of the cathepsin L precursor and processed proteins ( single and double chains ) were not affected by the ConA treatment in XC cells , suggesting that ConA treatment does not attenuate cathepsin L activity in XC cells . Interestingly , the cathepsin L processing occurs less efficiently in XC cells than in NIH3T3 and L6 cells , although the cathepsin L activity in XC cells was similar to that in NIH3T3 cells ( Fig . 4G ) . Cathepsin L cDNA was isolated from XC cells by RT - PCR ( Accession No . AB630323 ) . The XC cell cathepsin L has no change in amino acid sequence compared to already reported rat cathepsin L sequences . Cathepsin B protein was not detected in XC cells by Western immunoblotting , probably because cathepsin B activity was relatively lower in XC cells ( Fig . 4G ) . Finally , these results indicate that cathepsins B and L are activated without endosome acidification in XC cells . MLV infections require dynamin - mediated endocytosis in NIH3T3 , XC , and TE671 cells The above findings prompted us to speculate that these MLV infections in XC cells occur through endosomes but do not require endosome acidification , because cathepsin proteases are activated independently of endosome acidification . To address this hypoth - esis , the effect of an endocytosis inhibitor , dynasore , on the MLV infections was analyzed . Dynasore is an inhibitor of dynamin GTPase required for endocytosis [ 24 ] . Target cells were pretreated with dynasore for 5 h and were inoculated with the Eco - MLV vector diluted with fresh medium . The dynasore treatment pH - Independent Infection by MLV in XC Cells PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 6 October 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 10 | e26180 pH - Independent Infection by MLV in XC Cells PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 7 October 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 10 | e26180 similarly attenuated the Eco - MLV infection in XC and NIH3T3 cells ( Fig . 6A ) . The inhibitory effect of dynasore on cell viability ( Fig . 6B ) was much more modest than the inhibition of the Eco - MLV infection . The dynasore treatment also inhibited the Ampho - , Poly - , Xeno - , and XMRV - MLV infections in TE671 ( Fig . 6C ) and XC cells ( Fig . 6D ) . However , dynasore treatment of CD4 - expressing TE671 cells did not inhibit infection by the HIV - 1 vector containing the HXB2 Env protein , consistent with previous reports [ 20 , 21 , 25 , 26 ] . The VSV - G - mediated infection was moderately inhibited by dynasore in XC and NIH3T3 cells , but was not affected in TE671 cells ( Fig . 6C ) . These results suggest that the Eco - , Ampho - , Poly - , Xeno - , and XMRV - MLV infections in XC cells require the dynamin - dependent endocytosis . When NIH3T3 cells were inoculated with the Eco - MLV vector diluted with the TE671 cell conditioned or cathepsin B - containing medium , the inhibitory effect of ConA on the Eco - MLV infection was minimized ( Figs . 2A and 3A ) , suggesting that the Eco - MLV infection in the presence of secreted cathepsin proteases occurs at the plasma membrane . To assess this hypothesis , the effect of dynasore on infection by the Eco - MLV vector diluted with the TE671 cell conditioned or cathepsin B - containing medium was analyzed . As expected , the infection was not significantly suppressed by dynasore ( P , 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 6A ) . This result supports that the Eco - MLV vector infection in the presence of secreted cathepsin proteases occurs at the plasma membrane . To confirm that the MLV infections occur through endosomes even in XC cells , we analyzed the effects of siRNAs against dynamin 2 mRNA on these MLV infections . Because mouse NIH3T3 , human TE671 , and rat XC cells were used in this study , we constructed siRNAs against mouse , human , and rat dynamin 2 mRNAs . As expected , the knockdown of dynamin 2 expression mediated by the siRNAs suppressed the MLV vector infections in mouse NIH3T3 ( Fig . 7A ) , human TE671 ( Fig . 7B ) , and rat XC cells ( Fig . 7C ) , but not the CXCR4 - tropic HIV - 1 and VSV infections . The siRNAs indeed attenuated dynamin 2 expression analyzed by Western immunoblotting ( Fig . 7D ) . These results indicate that the Eco - , Ampho - , Poly - , Xeno - , and XMRV - MLV vector infections require dynamin 2 - mediated endocytosis even in XC cells . Ebola virus infection is pH - independent in XC cells Ebola virus infection also requires endosome acidification and endosomal cathepsin proteases like the MLV infections [ 27 ] . Infection of XC cells by Ebola virus GP - pseudotyped MLV vector might be low pH - independent . To assess this hypothesis , the effect of ConA treatment on the Ebola - MLV vector infection was analyzed . As expected , the ConA treatment inhibited the Ebola virus GP - mediated infection in TE671 cells , but not in XC cells ( Fig . 8A ) . The Ebola virus GP - mediated infection was suppressed by CA - 074Me treatment in TE671 and XC cells ( Fig . 8B ) , indicating that the Ebola - MLV vector infection in XC cells requires endosomal cathepsins but not endosome acidification . However , dynasore treatment did not significantly attenuated the Ebola - MLV infection in TE671 and XC cells ( Fig . 8C ) , consistent with the previous report showing that the Ebola virus infection occurs through dynamin - independent macropinocytosis [ 28 ] . These results indicate that not only the MLV infections but also the Ebola virus infection are pH - independent in XC cells . ConA , CA - 074Me , dynasore , siRNAs do not inhibit MLV vector binding to target cells To test whether MLV vector binding was modulated by ConA , CA - 074Me , or dynasore inhibitor , we monitored the vector - cell complex formation in the presence of each inhibitor . The antiserum used for this assay recognizes Env proteins of Eco - , Ampho - , Poly , and Xeno - MLVs in Western immunoblotting [ 29 ] . The Eco - MLV vector bound to TE671 / mCAT1 cells but not to TE671 cells ( Fig . 9A ) , indicating that the binding is mCAT1 - dependent , as previously reported in human NP2 cells [ 30 ] . Binding of the Eco - MLV vector to target cells was not suppressed by the inhibitors in XC ( Fig . 9B ) , NIH3T3 , and TE671 ( data not shown ) cells . Similarly , the siRNA - mediated knockdown of dynamin 2 expression did not inhibit the formation of MLV / target cell complexes ( data not shown ) . Thus , the inhibitors and the siRNA - mediated dynamin 2 knockdown did not attenuate the MLV vector infections by suppressing MLV particle binding to the target cells . Digestion of MLV Env proteins by cathepsin B This study indicates that cathepsin proteases are required for the Eco - , Ampho - , Poly - , Xeno - , and XMRV - MLV vector infections . It has been reported that the Eco - MLV Env protein is digested by cathepsin B [ 13 ] , suggesting that the digestion of the Env protein activates the entry capability . To assess whether the Ampho - , Poly - , Xeno - , and XMRV Env proteins are digested by cathepsin B , purified MLV vector particles were treated with cathepsin B ( 100 ng / ml ) at pH 5 . 0 , and analyzed by Western immunoblotting . Digested products were detected in the Eco - , Ampho - , and Poly - Env proteins ( Fig . 10 ) . It has been reported that 52 and 28 kDa digested products were detected in digestion of the Eco - Env protein by cathepsin B , and the 28 kDa peptide contains N - terminal receptor - binding domain [ 13 ] . In our study , the 52 kDa product was detected , but the 28 kDa was not . Because the anti - MLV SU antiserum used in our study recognized all of the Eco - , Ampho - , Poly - , Xeno - , and XMRV - Env proteins , the antiserum primarily recognizes the conserved C - terminal domains of these Env proteins , but not the variable N - terminal receptor binding domains . Therefore , the 28 kDa product was not detected by this antiserum . Digested products were not detected in the Xeno - and XMRV - Env proteins . However , amounts of the undigested SU proteins were reduced by the cathepsin B treatment . This result suggests that the Xeno - and XMRV - Env proteins are digested by cathepsin B at many cleavage sites . Figure 4 .

It had been generally accepted that the Eco - MLV entry into XC cells occurs at the plasma membrane , and not through endosomes [ 11 ] . However , the CA - 074Me treatment attenuated MLV infections in XC cells , showing that the MLV infections of XC cells require endosomal cathepsin proteases . This conflicting result prompted us to challenge the previous theory that the Eco - MLV infection in XC cells occurs at the plasma membrane [ 11 ] . The propeptide of cathepsin proteases facilitates folding of the enzymes , acts as an inhibitor preventing proteolytic activity of the enzymes , and is responsible for targeting to endosomes [ 23 ] . The propeptide of cathepsin protease masks its active site , and inhibits the protease activity . Conformation of the propeptide - containing cathepsin protease is changed in acidic condition of endosomes , and the active site is exposed . After the active site is exposed by low pH , the propeptide of cathepsin is cleaved by itself or other Figure 5 . Treatment with endosome acidification inhibitors does not alter activities of cathepsins B and L in XC cells . TE671 and XC cells were treated with ConA ( 3 nM ) or DMSO . The treated cells were stained with the cathepsin B ( panel A ) or L ( panel B ) detection reagent . Closed areas indicate cells unstained with the reagents . Open areas indicate cells treated with DMSO and stained with the reagent . Grey areas indicate cells treated with ConA and stained with the reagent .

Therefore , it is thought that treatment by the endosome acidification inhibitors prevent the MLV infections by suppressing the cathepsin protease activation . The treatment did not inhibit cathepsin protease activity and cathepsin L processing in XC cells , indicating that cathepsin proteases are activated independently of endosome acidification in XC cells . This independence may explain why the MLV infections in XC cells do not require endosome acidification and are not attenuated by the endosome acidification inhibitors . Thus , the MLV infections in XC cells occur through endosomes and the pH - independent activation of endosomal cathepsin proteases induces the pH - independent MLV infections in XC cells ( Fig . 11 ) . The dynasore treatment and siRNA - mediated dynamin 2 knockdown inhibited the MLV infections in all examined cells , strongly supporting the above observations . These results indicate that the MLV particles are internalized by endocytosis for a productive infection in XC cells similar to other susceptible cells . The MLV and Ebola virus Env proteins used in this study recognize different infection receptors as described in Introduc - tion . It is suggested that interactions with these different receptors lead to the same endocytic entry pathway for all these viruses . Based on this model of the virus entry pathway , the virus Env proteins are activated by cathepsin - mediated digestion after internalized into acidic endosomes . Therefore , it is unlikely that viral proteins directly induce the internalization of viral particles into endosomes . This suggests that these different infection receptors are responsible for the endocytic entry pathway . Figure 6 . MLV infections are inhibited by dynasore . ( A ) XC and NIH3T3 cells were pretreated with dynasore and were inoculated with the Eco - MLV vector diluted with fresh , TE671 cell conditioned , or cathepsin B ( 100 ng / ml ) - containing medium .

( C ) TE671 , TE671 / mCAT1 , or TE671 / CD4 cells were pretreated with dynasore and were inoculated with the Eco - , Ampho - , Poly - , Xeno - , XMRV - , VSV - MLV , or HXB2 - HIV - 1 vector .

The transduction units obtained with DMSO - treated cells were set to 100 % . These experiments were repeated in triplicate , and results are shown as the mean + / 2 SD .

Because the MLV vector - producing TELCeB6 cells were constructed from TE617 cells [ 31 ] , their cells secrete cathepsin proteases as well as the MLV vector particles . Env proteins on the MLV vector particles should be digested by secreted cathepsin proteases , soon after the vector particles are released from the vector - producing cells . However , infection by the MLV vectors produced from TELCeB6 cells required endosome acidification and cathepsin proteases in NIH3T3 cells . Dilution of the MLV vector with the conditioned or cathepsin B - containing medium significantly attenuated the transduction efficiency , suggesting that the digested Env proteins are unstable or released from the MLV vector particles . Indeed , the digested products of Env proteins were not detected in the MLV vector preparations . Therefore , infections by the MLV vectors produced from transfected TELCeB6 cells require endosome acidification and cathepsin proteases in NIH3T3 cells . Cathepsin L activity in XC cells was similar to that in NIH3T3 cells , and cathepsin L processing occurred less efficiently in XC cells than in NIH3T3 and L6 cells , suggesting that unprocessed cathepsin L is active in XC cells . It has been reported that glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin sulfate and heparin facilitate cathepsin B activation at natural pH [ 23 ] . However , treatment of XC cells with chondroitinase or heparinase did not affect the pH - independent Eco - MLV vector infection ( data not shown ) . Mechanism by which cathepsin proteases are activated without endosome acidification in XC cells is unknown . It has been reported that disruption of microtubules markedly reduces the Eco - MLV infection in NIH3T3 cells , but does not in XC cells [ 19 ] . Based on the previous theory that the Eco - MLV infection occurs at cell surface in XC cells but does through endosomes in NIH3T3 cells , the authors have explained that the difference is resulted from the different entry pathways . However , since it was found that the Eco - MLV infection occurs through endosomes in XC and NIH3T3 cells , endosomes in which cathepsin proteases are activated without acidification might be different from those in which cathepsins are activated by acidification . Microtubule - independent endocytosis might induce endosomes in which cathepsins are activated without acidification , and specifically occur in XC cells . Figure 7 . MLV infections are inhibited by siRNA - mediated knockdown of dynamin 2 expression . ( A ) NIH3T3 cells were transfected with an siRNA against mouse dynamin 2 mRNA , and were inoculated with the Eco - MLV vector . ( B ) TE671 or TE671 / CD4 cells were transfected with an siRNA against human dynamin 2 mRNA , and were inoculated with the Ampho - , Poly - , Xeno - , XMRV - , VSV - MLV , or HXB2 - HIV - 1 vector .

Actin expression was analyzed as control . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0026180 . g007 pH - Independent Infection by MLV in XC Cells PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 11 October 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 10 | e26180 The endosome acidification inhibitors significantly ( 1 / 10 ) attenuated the MLV , vector infections , but moderately ( 1 / 2 ) suppressed cathepsin activities . MLV vectors were diluted to induce about 20 to 40 infected cells in 1 mm 2 . Because 6 - cm dishes were used in this experiment , it was estimated that about 10 5 cells are infected in a dish . In the inhibitor - treated cells , 10 4 cells were still infected . Therefore , it is not suspicious that cathepsin activity of the target cells correlates to susceptibility to the MLV infections . The membrane - permeable CA - 074Me treatment inhibited the MLV infections at 40 m M , but the unpermeable cathepsin inhibitor III did not even at 200 m M . We have previously reported that an unpermeable cathepsin L inhibitor , CLIK148 , suppresses the Eco - MLV infection at 1000 m M [ 14 ] . All these inhibitors can be incorporated into endosomes by endocytosis . Additionally , the membrane - permeable inhibitor can reach endosomes by passing through membranes . Therefore , the membrane - permeable inhib - itor suppressed the MLV vector infections at lower concentration than the unpermeable inhibitors . In this study , the VSV - G - pseudotyped MLV vector infection was moderately suppressed by dynasore in XC and NIH3T3 cells , and was not in TE671 cells . The knockdown of dynamin 2 expression by siRNAs did not affect the VSV - G - pseudotyped vector infection . Although the VSV - G - mediated infection also occurs through endosomes , it has been reported that VSV infection enters host cells through endosomes incompletely coated with clathrin [ 32 ] . The unconventional endocytosis might not require dynamin 2 , and the VSV - G - mediated infection might be independent of dynamin 2 . Because the Eco - MLV infection is pH - independent and induced pH - independent syncytium formation in XC cells , it had been widely accepted that the Eco - MLV infection in XC cells occurs at cell surface [ 11 ] . It had been thought that the pH - independent Eco - MLV infection always links to the pH - indepen - dent syncytium formation by the Eco - MLV infection . However , Wilson et al have found a transformed cell line , NIH3T3 / DTras , in which the Eco - MLV infection is pH - dependent but induces the pH - independent syncytium formation [ 33 ] , suggesting that the membrane fusion mechanisms for the viral entry and for syncytium formation are different , consistent with our previous finding [ 8 ] . It had been generally accepted that the Eco - MLV entry into XC cells occurs at the plasma membrane , and not through endosomes [ 11 ] . We believe that our study resolved the mechanism by which the MLV infections are pH - independent in XC cells at last . The conclusion made in this study does not support the previous conclusion and represent the novel finding . Materials and Methods Cells Human 293T [ 34 ] , NP2 [ 35 ] , and TE671 [ 31 ] , mouse NIH3T3 [ 36 ] and SC - 1 [ 37 ] , rat XC [ 18 ] and L6 [ 38 ] , and monkey COS7 [ 39 ] cells were cultured in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium ( Wako ) supplemented with 8 % fetal bovine serum ( Biosources ) at 37 u C in 5 % CO 2 . MLV vector producing cells were constructed by stable transfection of TELCeB6 cells [ 31 ] with ecotropic Friend [ 8 ] , amphotropic [ 40 ] , polytropic [ 41 ] , xenotropic [ 6 ] , or XMRV [ 42 ] Env expression plasmid as previously reported [ 29 ] . Eco - MLV receptor - expressing 293T and TE671 cells were constructed using an mCAT1 - encoding MLV vector as previously described [ 17 ] . Retrovirus vectors Culture supernatants of TELCeB6 cells [ 31 ] stably transfected with the ecotropic , amphotropic , polytropic , xenotropic , or XMRV Env protein expression plasmid were used to inoculate target cells . The VSV - G - or Ebola virus GP - pseudotyped MLV vector was constructed by transient transfection of TELCeB6 cells with a VSV - G [ 43 ] or Ebola virus GP expression plasmid [ 28 ] . The HIV - 1 vector containing the HXB2 Env protein was constructed by transient transfection of COS7 cells with the Figure 8 . Ebola virus infection in XC cells is pH - independent .

The culture media from transfected cells was replaced with fresh media 24 h after transfection , and the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h . Supernatants of transfected cell cultures were used to inoculate target cells . Transduction assay Target cells were plated onto 6 - cm dishes , and cultured for 24 h . The cells were pretreated with ConA ( Sigma ) , BFLA - 1 ( Sigma ) , CA - 074Me ( Sigma ) , or dynasore ( Calbiochem ) for 5 h . The treated cells were washed with media to remove the inhibitors . Culture supernatants of the vector - producing cells were diluted with fresh or conditioned media as follows : the Eco - and Ampho - MLV vectors were diluted 1000 - fold and the Poly - , Xeno - and VSV - MLV as well as XMRV vectors were diluted 10 - fold . The Ebola virus GP - pseudotyped MLV vector was not diluted . Target cells were inoculated by complete replacement of culture medium by diluted viral vectors . By the dilution , 20 â 40 infected cells were detected in 1 mm 2 of control DMSO - treated cells . Alternatively , the target cells were inoculated with the MLV vectors in presence of cathepsin inhibitor III ( Calbiochem ) or purified cathepsin B ( Calbiochem ) . The inoculated cells were cultured for 48 h , and then stained with 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl - b - D - galactopyranoside ( Wako ) . The blue cells were counted in 10 randomly selected microscopic fields , and relative values to the infected cell numbers in control cells were compared between samples . Cell viability Target cells were treated with the inhibitors for 5 h and were washed with media to remove the inhibitors . Fresh media was added to the cells and they were cultured for 48 h . The cells were then collected and stained with trypan blue ( Cosmo Bio ) . The amount of unstained cells was quantitated in a counting chamber . Cathepsin protease activity assay To measure the activities of cathepsins B and L in cell lysates , the cathepsin B and L activity assay kits ( BioVision , Mountain View , CA ) were used , respectively . The cathepsin activity assay kit is a fluorescence - based assay that utilizes the preferred cathepsin B or L substrate amino acid sequence labeled with amino - 4 - trifluoromethyl coumarin ( AFC ) . Cell lysates that contain cathepsin B or L will cleave the synthetic AFC - labeled substrate to release free AFC , and generate fluorescence . Cell lysates prepared from 1 6 10 6 cells were incubated with the cathepsin B or L substrate for 1 h at 37 u C , and fluorescence intensity at 505 nm was measured by a fluorescence microplate reader ( PerkinElmer ) . Cathepsin activities in living cells were measured as follows . Cells were stained with the cathepsin B or L detection reagent ( Cell Technology , Minneapolis , MN ) . The reagent utilizes fluorophore cresyl violet that is bi - substituted by an amide linkage to a peptide that contains a cathepsin B or L target cleavage sequence . In this form , the cresyl violet leaving group is non - fluorescent . Following cleavage at the amide linkage site by cathepsin B or L in living cells , the mono and non - substituted cresyl violet fluorophores generate red fluorescence . The stained Figure 9 .
