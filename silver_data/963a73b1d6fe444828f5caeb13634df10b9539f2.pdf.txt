These phase transitions could impact a broad range of biological outcomes . Here , by developing proximity - biotinylation approaches , we unveil the composition of the condensate known as processing bodies ( PBs ) in the model plant Arabidopsis . We show that PBs comprise both conserved and dynamic networks with unexpected connections to membrane subdomains . We study further one of these networks and discover a cell vertex - defining module with membrane remodeling properties . This module functions through a liquid / solid - like phase transition that impacts growth . The underlying mechanism is developmentally regulated by a tug - of - war between PBs and the plasma membrane instructed by a phospho - switch . We thus provide a framework for the elucidation of condensates in plants and describe a growth module based on phase transitions of condensates at a membranous interface . HIGHLIGHTS • The RNP composition of plant processing bodies can only be determined by proximity biotinylation approaches • Plant processing bodies furnish unique and dynamic coregulons highlighting regulatory hubs • Plant processing bodies are surprisingly dynamic and remodel membrane compartments • The phosphorylation status and material properties of a single processing bodies protein defines a growth module at the cell vertex 3 Introduction 1 Liquid - liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) is a biomolecular state that can favor 2 ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) condensation through weak intra - or intermolecular interactions . 3 In the interest of brevity , we use hereafter the term “condensates” . Condensates may 4 localize in the nucleus , cytoplasm , or at plasma membrane interfaces , such as the 5 animal - specific junction adherent molecules ( Beutel et al . , 2019b ; Zaccara and Jaffrey , 6 2020 ) . The archetypal evolutionarily conserved condensates known as processing 7 bodies ( PBs ) are constitutive cytoplasmic assemblies enriched in proteins modulating 8 RNA silencing , decapping , and decay ( Gutierrez - Beltran et al . , 2015 ) . PBs in animals 9 appear to be long - term storage sites for mRNAs poised to be released for translation 10 following cues like stress , metabolism , and translation capacity . 11 Albeit readily visible in cells , the fact that condensates depend on a meshwork of 12 weak interactions and the lack of surrounding membrane makes their isolation 13 challenging . Proximity biotin ligation ( PDL ) harnesses covalent biotinylation of proteins 14 interacting with or are near - neighbors of a certain prey protein in vivo ; we and others 15 have shown that plant cells are amenable to PDL approaches ( Arora et al . , 2020 ) . By 16 surpassing the need to retain native interactions for their identification , the advent of 17 PDL could help to delineate the overall organization and thus functions of condensates . 18 PDL is based on abortive promiscuous biotin ligases fused to baits which biotinylate prey 19 RNA or proteins whenever the distance between bait - prey is within a few nanometers 20 ( Kim et al . , 2014 ) . 21 Inspired by PDL applications for the elucidation of biomolecular assemblies 22 including condensates in non - plant models ( for example ( Youn et al . , 2018 ) , we 23 established and refined two relevant and complementary approaches for the 24 determination of ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) composition of condensates in plants . We 25 used these approaches for PBs as they are an ideal condensate to begin such studies 26 owning to their omnipresence . We show that PDL approaches surpass other classical 27 approaches of compositional determination of condensates . We determine the RNP 28 composition of PBs showing that PBs are organized into conserved or plant - specific 29 RNP - related functional modules that can furnish unique co - regulons . These modules 30 show unconventional contacts to plasma membrane domains perhaps owning to the 31 reduced valency of proteins in PBs that could allow such contacts . By delving into these 32 4 contacts , we discovered a cell vertex - specific pathway regulating membrane dynamics 33 and growth by following principles of material phase transitions . 34 Results 35 The Arabidopsis PBs Proteome and Transcriptome 36 We postulated that due to the sessile nature of plants , to rapidly adapt to environmental 37 cues plants have compositionally variable condensates . As such , plant condensates would 38 form upon very weak and transient interactions , lost during cell lysis as also supported by 39 others ( Fang et al . , 2019 ) . To test this assumption , we aimed at studying PBs as non - plant 40 PBs are omnipresent and have features of LLPS droplet - like condensates . Depending on 41 conditions , PBs show dynamicity and can also grow , shrink or fuse akin to membrane - 42 bound organelles ( Lee et al . , 2020 ) . We confirmed that plant PBs show LLPS properties : 43 using the major PBs component known as DCP1 ( DECAPPING PROTEIN 1 homolog of 44 Arabidopsi s thaliana ) that effectively decorates PBs ( Gutierrez - Beltran et al . , 2015 ) and 45 results herein ) , we noticed that PBs show circularity , viscoelasticity , and sensitivity to the 46 aliphatic alcohol 1 , 6 - hexanediol treatment that reversibly dissolves liquid - like assemblies 47 in living cells ( Fig . S1 , A - C ) ( Alberti et al . , 2019 ) . 48 We then established a stepwise approach that couples a standard affinity 49 purification ( AP ) step , based on the capture of the tag FLAG , with a PDL step that 50 harnesses the biotin ligase TurboID ( Fig . 1A ) . As a bait , we fused a chimeric TurboID - 51 FLAG sequence to DCP1a ( DCP1 - TurboID - FLAG ) and used GFP as a control ( GFP - 52 TurboID - FLAG ) . Both the bait and the control were driven by the 35S promoter ( from 53 the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus ) , with comparable to native protein expression levels , and 54 efficient biotinylation ( Fig . S1D and S2 , A , B ) . In support of our hypothesis that plant 55 condensates are loose structures , we noticed that the remaining supernatant ( “flow - 56 through” ) after the AP step showed surprisingly high biotinylation ( Fig . S2C ) . This result 57 implied that many PB - related proteins could evade AP and concomitantly identification . 58 The aforementioned tandem approach that couples AP with PDL is referred to hereafter 59 as “APEAL” . 60 5 We next used mass spectrometry to define APEAL effectiveness in untreated or 61 heat - treated plants ( hereafter “NS” ; 22 o C or “HS” ; 2h at 37 o C ) . Short - term HS is ideal for 62 benchmarking APEAL , as PBs increase in size and number upon HS , thereby leading to 63 tractable differences in composition ( Gutierrez - Beltran et al . , 2021 ) ; HS did not 64 significantly affect biotinylation ( Fig . S2A , B ; “24h” vs . “HS” ) . The mass spectrometry 65 yielded equivalent protein hits in both AP and PDL ( Fig . S2D ) . Consistently with the 66 presence of biotinylated proteins after the AP , this step did not enrich conserved PB 67 proteins ; yet , AP - step could produce another protein set likely comprising strong DCP1 68 interactors ( File S1 ) . In contrast , the PDL - step could enrich a set of conserved PB 69 proteins but not stress granule markers , albeit the two structures being in proximity 70 ( log 2 FC > 1 . 5 ; Fig . 1A , table ) ( Gutierrez - Beltran et al . , 2021 ) . This result showed that 71 APEAL can function at a submicron scale ( < μ m ) , thereby providing the required spatial 72 resolution to resolve condensates’ composition . 73 Associations with PBs were binned according to relative enrichment in three bins 74 ( log 2 FC < 0 , 0 < log 2 FC < 1 , log 2 FC > 1 ) . We tested selected and novel protein associations 75 from these bins using two - color colocalizations and bimolecular fluorescence 76 complementation ( BiFC ; or “split - YFP” ) in the Nicotiana benthamiana leaf expression 77 system ( Fig . S3 , A , B ; File S2 ) . The BiFC efficiency was estimated by the reconstituted 78 YFP raw signal intensity and YFP - positive puncta per cell ( Fig . S3A ) . The 79 colocalizations were estimated by Pearson Correlation Coefficient ( PCC ; Fig . S3B ) . By 80 applying a pre - selection criterion of enrichment ( log 2 FC > 0 . 5 ) for the selection of preys , 81 we could significantly increase the probability of identifying successful binary 82 interactions between PBs ( i . e . cYFP - DCP1 ) and the identified proteins : 6 / 7 preys were 83 confirmed as PBs constituents , while PDL had higher predictive power than the AP step 84 irrespective of whether proteins were enriched in NS or HS ( File S2 ) . 85 Under the premise that APEAL could efficiently determine PBs proteome , we 86 aimed at coupling PDL with RNA immunoprecipitation to determine PBs transcriptome . 87 We thus repurposed APEAL for RNA purification ( Fig . 1B ) . We determined conditions 88 by which we could achieve efficient RNA immunoprecipitation following TurboID . As 89 an RNA - protein crosslinker , we opted for mild formaldehyde treatment ( referred 90 hereafter as “FA” ) ; attempts with other cross - linkers were less successful and may need 91 6 further optimization . For this approach referred hereafter as “Turbo - RNA 92 immunoprecipitation ( T - RIP ) ” we used the same plants and conditions as aforementioned 93 for APEAL . 94 Following the T - RIP pipeline , eluted RNA was subjected to paired RNA 95 sequencing ( 20 million reads / sample ) yielding 33 , 602 transcripts with 1 , 670 / 2 , 723 96 significantly enriched in PBs ( log 2 FC > 1 ) in NS and HS , respectively ( File S3 ) . We tested 97 the specificity of T - RIP by single - molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization ( smFISH ) 98 and quantitative colocalizations between GFP - DCP1 and a set of mRNA probes ( Fig . 99 S4A - C ) . We selected EBF2 , DFL1 , DOT1 , and RAP2 . 4 mRNAs which were enriched in 100 the DCP1 dataset in both NS and HS , and as negative control the depleted PP2A ( File 101 S4 ) . Under our setting , smFISH provided information about the cell - to - cell variation in 102 transcript abundance and the subcellular localization of a given RNA in root cells . We 103 could confirm the colocalization between GFP - DCP1 and EBF2 , DFL1 , and RAP2 . 4 but 104 not with DOT1 , as it did not produce a detectable signal under our conditions ( Fig . S4A - 105 C ) . Together , these results speak for the superiority of the APEAL / T - RIP over other 106 approaches in condensate studies . 107 Plant PBs Store RNAs and Show Unique Valency Features 108 Next , we aimed at determining the features of RNPs associated with PBs and define 109 features that bring about the overall multivalency required for PBs formation . PBs 110 showed a higher protein - coding RNAs proportion ( both in NS and HS ) than the 111 normalized total transcriptome ( 95 % versus 80 % for total or 86 % in NS / 73 % in HS for 112 depleted in the GFP control ) , while all other RNA categories conversely dropped ( Fig . 113 S5A ) . This result implied that targeting to PBs is associated with translation control , 114 further supported by a comparison between normalized protein and RNA levels in PBs ( r 115 = - 0 . 14 ) . Because RNA decay factors accumulate in PBs ( Gutierrez - Beltran et al . , 2021 ; 116 Luo et al . , 2018 ) , it was proposed that mRNAs targeted to PBs degrade . Although the 117 UTRs regulate mRNA translation and turnover , we found a poor correlation between 118 mean UTRs length ( and total length ) with mRNA accumulation in PBs slightly increasing 119 though during HS ( r = 0 . 056 in NS vs 0 . 12 in HS ; Fig . S5B - E ) . This increase is further 120 supported by the RNA read distributions across mRNAs showing a slight reduction 121 7 towards the 3’ - UTR , and the association of the adenylation - regulating machinery with 122 PBs ( Fig . S5B ) . Two lines of evidence further argue against a general RNA degradation 123 function for plant PBs under normal conditions and rather support mRNA storage and not 124 transport ( Fig . S5F ) . ( 1 ) RNAs accumulating in PBs seem to be slightly more abundant 125 than other transcripts ( r = 0 . 10 in NS vs . 0 . 34 in HS ) , suggesting that their decay in PBs , 126 if any , has a limited impact on their overall levels . ( 2 ) half - lives of mRNAs are only 127 slightly anti - correlated with PBs accumulation during NS and PBs are not enriched for 128 transported RNAs ( r = - 0 . 10 ; Fig . S5F , G ) . Yet , some mRNAs defined as having high 129 degradation rates were enriched during HS ( File S5 ) ( Yu et al . , 2019 ) . 130 Furthermore , N 6 - methyladenosine ( m 6 A ) - modified mRNAs were slightly 131 enriched during HS ( Fig . S5H ) . As plant m 6 A readers , the ECTs ( Evolutionarily 132 Conserved C - Terminal Region ) were also enriched in APEAL / T - RIP ( File S6 ) , and their 133 counterparts in animals , the YTHDF - cage containing proteins , regulate the formation of 134 condensates through m 6 A attachment that enhances valency ( Zaccara and Jaffrey , 2020 ) , 135 we asked whether PBs dynamics are driven by increased m 6 A valency . As the 136 constitutive ECTs depletion in Arabidopsis leads to pleiotropic phenotypes which may 137 skew PBs number and size , we designed a transient CRISPR ( clustered regularly 138 interspaced short palindromic repeats ) - depletion assay targeting three highly enriched in 139 PBs ECTs in protoplasts deriving from leaves constitutively expressing p35S : GFP - DCP1 140 ( ECT4 , 6 and 8 ; Fig . S6A , B ) . Surprisingly , we observed a slight increase of GFP - DCP1 141 positive foci in protoplasts , which may suggest that ECTs attenuate PBs numbers by 142 promoting mRNA turnover . Likewise , the targeting of YTHDF proteins and m 6 A - mRNA 143 to animal PBs facilitates m 6 A - mRNA degradation ( Fu and Zhuang , 2020 ) . On the 144 contrary , we observed that depletion of other identified components of PBs significantly 145 reduced PBs ( Fig . S6A ) . These results suggest that mRNAs localized at PBs do not 146 necessarily have special features , while accumulation in PBs represents a state at which 147 mRNAs are mostly kept inert and do not necessarily undergo degradation . 148 As PB - localizing mRNAs seem to have disparate features to one another and do 149 not seem to drive PBs compositional valency , we next queried features of protein 150 valency . A hallmark of many proteins prone to participate in condensates is the presence 151 of prion - like domains ( PLDs ) , that can contain polar amino acids often punctuated by 152 8 aromatic residues which can affect valency ( Zaccara and Jaffrey , 2020 ) . We thus 153 examined the PLD composition of PBs . In silico analyses through the PLAAC that 154 determines PLDs using a hidden - Markov model algorithm ( Dosztanyi et al . , 2005 ) , 155 revealed that only during HS the PBs were enriched in PLDs when normalized to the 156 depleted in PBs components GFP control ( Fig . S7A and File S7 ) . Intriguingly , we 157 observed a rather stable normalized PLD length ( PLD length versus total protein size ) for 158 different plant species with various growth habits , while the normalized length was 159 significantly shorter compared to the corresponding human protein counterparts ( Fig . 160 S7B and File S7 ; r ~ 0 . 5 for plants vs . 0 . 8 for humans ) . Although the PDL length cannot 161 directly connote the propensity of protein meshworks to undergo phase transitions , we 162 assume that plant PBs components show decreased multivalency manifested as reduced 163 structural stability . This finding may provide the physicochemical incentive for more 164 plastic PBs organization in plants , highlighting that certain components may easily evade 165 from PBs as described below . 166 PBs Furnish Plant - Specific Co - regulons Implicating Membrane Remodeling 167 Processes 168 The potentially plastic behavior of PBs driven by decreased valency prompted us to 169 examine whether PBs can furnish unique networks ( Hubstenberger et al . , 2017 ) . To 170 interpret and identify functional networks , we binned RNA datasets according to Gene 171 Ontology ( GO ) enrichments ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Most mRNAs / proteins enriched in PBs fit in 172 specific subclusters involved in chromatin organization , RNA localization , RNA 173 transport , and membrane remodeling ( Fig . 1C , D ; 2 , A and B ; File S8 ) . At the proteome 174 level , the retrieval of publicly available direct protein - protein interaction ( PPI ) data from 175 STRING showed that PDL formed a denser PPI network than AP , with an average 176 number of interactions per protein 5 . 4 ( p = 5 . 6e - 11 ) and 4 . 1 ( p = 2 . 1e - 10 ) for NS and HS , 177 respectively ( Fig . 2B , C ) . Consistent with the increased PBs formation during HS , the 178 process term “PΒs” was more enriched in PDL during HS ( p = 6 . 9e - 22 ) . We could assign 179 three interconnected subnetworks to PBs according to overrepresentations in AP and 180 PDL datasets from both HS and NS ( Fig . S8 ) . In subnetwork 1 , we identified hits of RNA 181 metabolism including the nuclear pore complex , m 6 A readers , and the adenylation - 182 9 regulating machinery . In subnetwork 2 , we identified hits of hormone signaling , defense 183 attenuation , translation , and metabolism . Finally , subnetwork 3 comprised an unexpected 184 network with hits linked to membrane remodeling / trafficking . This subnetwork was 185 further divided into four major dense clades that included the i ) ESCRT ( endosomal 186 sorting complex required for transport ) ; ii ) dynamin - related proteins ( DRPs ) that are 187 force - generating proteins regulating endocytosis and membrane dynamics ; iii ) plant - 188 specific endocytic TPLATE complex ( Arora et al . , 2020 ) , and iv ) cytoskeleton . 189 Furthermore , through integration analysis between protein / RNA networks , we 190 aimed at identifying biological processes co - regulated at RNA and protein levels via PBs . 191 These results could reveal processes that need to be tightly and dynamically controlled by 192 PBs at both the transcriptome and proteome levels as an efficient ON / OFF switch . We 193 integrated merged networks of AP and PDL ( “biological processes” ) with T - RIP datasets 194 filtering out redundant terms ( log 2 FC > 0 . 5 ) . This pipeline revealed six major subclusters , 195 with the most prevalent being endocytosis and vesicle trafficking , especially during HS 196 ( Fig . 2E ) . STRING network analysis of the endocytosis / vesicle trafficking subcluster 197 resulted in specific genes involved in vesicle - mediated transport , endocytosis , and 198 connected to the ESCRT I complex ( Fig . 2E ) . Altogether , these data suggest that PBs are 199 function convergence sites where a dynamic co - regulon is established especially during 200 HS likely to shut off a trafficking pathway . 201 PBs Components Associate With the Plasma Membrane and Define Cell Vertices 202 We strived to ascribe a biological function for the unexpected links of PBs to membranes . 203 Using total internal reflection microscopy ( TIRFM ) , which excels at looking at cell 204 surface processes due to the shallow illumination penetration ( decay constant ~ 100 nm ) , 205 we observed occasional stalling and fusion of DCP1 - GFP - positive droplets at the plasma 206 membrane interface of root cells ( Fig . 3A , B ) , suggesting that DCP1 droplets may 207 eventually coalesce to furnish continuous plasma membrane domains . Indeed , DCP1 and 208 other PBs core components were localized at plasma membrane apical or basal domains 209 ( Fig . 3C ) . During HS , DCP1 was reduced at the plasma membrane while increasing at the 210 PBs ( Fig . 3C ) , which supports the idea that co - regulons may inflict tight and plastic 211 control over a trafficking pathway . 212 10 Raw fluorescence intensity calculations and partition analyses between the plasma 213 membrane and the cytoplasm showed that DCP1 remained at the plasma membrane , in 214 contrast to other core PBs components that showed transient or occasional associations 215 ( Fig . S9A ) . We thus asked whether DCP1 could directly bind membrane lipids . Four 216 lines of evidence support the direct binding of DCP1 to membrane lipids . ( 1 ) In silico 217 structural analyses showed that DCP1 has a conserved pleckstrin homology domain ( PH ) 218 that could potentially bind plasma membrane - resident PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 lipids ( Fig . S10 and 219 S11 , A and B ) . Furthermore , DCP1 lacks a signal peptide or transmembrane domain and 220 consistently failed to accumulate intracellularly upon treatment with brefeldin A ( Fig . 221 S9B ) . ( 2 ) DCP1 could co - sediment with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich small unilamellar vesicles 222 ( Fig . S10 and S11C ) . ( 3 ) In vivo , the inhibitor PAO ( phenyl arsine oxide ; a PI - 4 - OH - 223 kinase inhibitor reducing PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels ) led to DCP1 depletion from the plasma 224 membrane of the core meristematic region ( designated hereafter as “QC” for quiescent 225 center ) , while in distal meristem the PAO effect was slower suggesting that additional 226 interactions stabilize DCP1 ( Fig . S9C ) . ( 4 ) DCP1 association with the plasma membrane 227 emerged usually at the maturing cell plate but not earlier ( Fig . 3D , E ) . Accordingly , 228 DCP1 detected by an anti - DCP1 antibody we produced , showed reduced accumulation at 229 the plasma membrane in a pi5K1 / 2 mutant background with lower levels of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 230 ( Fig . S9D ) . These results suggest that DCP1 may have specific functions at the plasma 231 membrane . 232 Dynamic imaging of DCP1 - GFP along the developmental root axis showed that 233 DCP1 gradually accumulated at cell edges ( Fig . 3D - F ) . We use the term “edge” in the 234 geometric sense of an intersection between two faces of a polyhedron , rather than the 235 meaning of periphery or front ( Kirchhelle et al . , 2016 ) . Interestingly , cell - edge localizing 236 proteins associate with PBs , e . g . SCAR / WAVE complex proteins , SOSEKI3 ( SOK3 ) , 237 and the adaptin - like TPLATE complex ( File S9 ) . Later during development , DCP1 - GFP 238 accumulated at cell vertices ( Fig . 3 , D to F ) . Again , the term “vertex” here is used in the 239 geometric sense to define the internal angular point of a polygon and can be defined as an 240 intersection between the three cell edges . The vertex localization of DCP1 was specific as 241 it was not observed for other PBs components examined ( Fig . 3C and Fig . S9D , E ) . This 242 localization is reminiscent of animal tricellular junctions , at which three cells intersect to 243 11 modulate epithelial tissues functions ( Bosveld et al . , 2018 ) . Furthermore , DCP1 - GFP 244 accumulation in vertices inversely correlated with localization at PBs at cells close to the 245 QC ( Fig . 3E ) , while vertex localization was enhanced by cycloheximide ( CHX ) or cold 246 treatments that dissolved PBs ( Fig . 3C and Fig . S9F ) ( Gutierrez - Beltran et al . , 2021 ) . 247 This result suggests a potential tug - of - war between PBs and vertices for DCP1 consistent 248 also with the PBs plasticity model . 249 The gradual accumulation of DCP1 at cell vertices prompted us to examine the 250 mechanism that restricts DCP1 there . The microtubule depolymerizing drug amiprophos - 251 methyl led to a significant signal spread of DCP1 from the vertex to the edge close to the 252 QC ( Fig . S9G ) . Although the drugs latrunculin B or cytochalasin D which disrupt actin 253 polymerization did not reduce DCP1 localization at the vertex , mutants of the actin - 254 nucleating SCAR / WAVE complex component ARPC5 ( CROOKED ) which associates 255 with cell edges ( Dyachok et al . , 2008 ) , reduced DCP1 restriction at cell vertices ( Fig . 256 S9G , H ) . These results suggest that microtubules and actin nucleators may function as a 257 molecular fence to restrict DCP1 diffusion thereby increasing spatial condensation . 258 We aimed at addressing the stabilization mechanism at vertices . Liquid - like 259 condensates display a viscous interior with rapid internal reorganization and fluorescent 260 recovery within few seconds , whereas more solid - like condensates show little or no 261 recovery ( Fang et al . , 2019 ) . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) assays 262 showed that DCP1 recovered rapidly in meristematic cells close to the QC at vertices 263 ( Fig . 3G ) . Yet , the FRAP recovery rate of DCP1 gradually descended towards the 264 elongation zone , accompanied by an increased DCP1 association with cell vertices . This 265 slow recovery rate suggests that DCP1 condensates have more solid - like properties , with 266 the small amount of recovery likely being contributed to by the exchange and / or addition 267 of protein at the condensate periphery . This result suggests that DCP1 evades PBs during 268 development to associate with vertices where it undergoes a liquid - to - solid transition . 269 DCP1 Establishes Clathrin Depletion Zones at Vertices 270 Given the tight associations of PBs to the endocytic machinery and with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 271 which can affect clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) ( Bethoney et al . , 2009 ) , we tested 272 whether major components of the endocytic machinery affect DCP1 localization . The 273 12 depletion of clathrin from the plasma membrane through the use of the dominant - 274 negative 4 - hydroxytamoxifen - inducible HUB1 ( INTAM > > HUB1 ) that disrupts clathrin 275 triskelion ( Kitakura et al . , 2011 ) , led to DCP1 reduction from the plasma membrane at 276 the proximal but not in the distal meristem ( Fig . 4A and Fig . S12A ) . This result suggested 277 that DCP1 could bind both PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and clathrin . 278 Imaging along the root proximodistal axis , showed that DCP1 - GFP colocalized 279 with clathrin light chain ( CLC2 - mOrange ) only in cells close to the QC ; thereafter , DCP1 280 associated with “clathrin - depleted zones” at vertices ( Fig . 4A ) . Furthermore , DCP1 281 localization at the vertex was uncoupled from localization at the plasma membrane , as 282 shown using the HUB1 lines or clathrin heavy chain ( chc1 - 3 ) mutants with compromised 283 plasma membrane DCP1 localization ( Fig . S12B ) . These data imply that DCP1 interferes 284 with endocytosis at the plasma membrane while generating unappreciated clathrin - 285 depletion zones at cell vertices once firmly stabilized there . 286 DCP1 Liquidity Modulates Membrane Fission 287 Recent evidence suggests that molecular condensates can affect membrane dynamics , 288 whereby molecular crowding functions as an endocytic modulator ( Day et al . , 2021 ) . 289 Although liquid condensates may provide the mechanical force required for membrane 290 remodeling , protein solid - states may stall fission probably due to insufficient molecular 291 fluidity that would favor membrane fission . We observed that occasionally the 292 amphiphilic styryl dye FM4 - 64 , an endocytosis uptake marker that fluoresces when 293 associated with membrane lipids , was retained for a long time at the DCP1 - decorated 294 clathrin - depleted regions ( Fig . 4B ) . This retention implied that DCP1 solid - like 295 assemblies inhibit endocytosis . On the contrary , FM4 - 64 uptake was enhanced in vertices 296 closer to the QC ( Fig . 4B ) . These results imply that DCP1 liquid - to - solid transition could 297 regulate a vertex - specific endocytic pathway . 298 We set out to validate whether liquid - to - solid transitions of DCP1 impinge on 299 endocytosis , by establishing an in vitro reconstitution system with the ability to monitor 300 fission events . First , we examined whether we could reconstitute the material properties 301 observed in vivo for DCP1 by establishing a partially labeled with maleimide 302 fluorochrome hexahistidine - tagged DCP1 ( Supplemental Methods ) . The relative 303 13 fluorescence intensity of the droplets compared with the surrounding solution provides an 304 estimate of the relative protein concentration in the two phases that enabled us to map a 305 temperature - concentration single - component phase diagram ( Riback et al . , 2020 ) . The 306 DCP1 droplets showed dynamic , LLPS behavior such as rapid exchange with the bulk 307 phase and slow fus ion ; above 25 μM or in presence of the crowding agent polyethylene - 308 glycol ( PEG ) , DCP1 converted to immiscible fibrilar or amorphous 1 , 6 - hexanediol 309 insensitive solid - like DCP1 assemblies with little to none FRAP recovery ( Fig . S13A - E ) . 310 Next , we incorporated supported bilayers with excess membrane reservoir 311 ( SUPER ) templates ( Pucadyil and Schmid , 2010 ) , allowing the seamless application of 312 microscopy - based assays to analyze membrane budding or fission , two important 313 processes for endocytosis ( Fig . 4C ) . SUPER templates contain a low - tension membrane 314 reservoir surrounding a glass bead and undergo membrane tubulation and fission upon 315 exposure to fission - inducing proteins . To study DCP1 effects on SUPER templates , we 316 first analyzed templates formed with a lipid composition that mimicked as much as 317 possible the inner plasma membrane leaflet . We formed fluorescently labeled SUPER 318 templates incorporating DOPC / DOPS / DGS - Ni / Texas red - PE ( 65 . 95 / 20 / 15 / 0 . 05 mol % ) . 319 Low concentrations of DCP1 - anchored at the SUPER templates underwent rapid LLPS 320 and could promote lipid - phase separation and fission seen as shredded liposomes , while 321 at higher concentrations DCP1 distributed mostly non - randomly and formed solid - like 322 assemblies which blocked fission and lipid phase separation ( Fig . 4D ) . In these 323 experiments , our control protein the RNA binding protein 1 ( RBP1 ) showing similar IDR 324 content to DCP1 , did not drive appreciable membrane release ( Fig . S11F ) . Taken 325 together these results suggest that DCP1 can directly remodel membranes and constitutes 326 a mechanism for endocytosis control . 327 DCP1 Association with Cell Vertices Defines a Growth Module 328 To examine the biological importance of DCP1 at vertices , we sought to determine an in 329 vivo system to modulate DCP1 levels at cell vertices . As the phosphorylation of Ser 237 of 330 DCP1 modulates DCP1 localization in PBs ( Yu et al . , 2019 ) and given our findings on 331 the tug - of - war between PBs and vertices for DCP1 , we assumed that DCP1 332 phosphorylation status could modulate DCP1 levels at vertices . The phosphomutant 333 14 variant DCP1 - GFP S237A ( in the dcp1 - 1 loss - of - function mutant background , driven by its 334 native promoter ) showed increased association with vertices , compared to the WT DCP1 - 335 GFP ( Fig . 5A ) . On the contrary , the phosphomimetic variant DCP1 - GFP S237D showed a 336 prevalent PBs localization alongside a pronounced inability to relocalize to cell vertices 337 and reduced tolerance to PAO ( Fig . S14 ) . We thus used these phospho - variants as a 338 proxy for the spatiotemporal control of DCP1 vertex localization . 339 Cell edges associate with uncharacterized trafficking pathways , that could 340 impinge on growth patterns ( Kirchhelle et al . , 2019 ) . We thus examined whether levels of 341 DCP1 in cell vertices may associate with spatial changes of endocytic rates at vertices 342 that could affect cell anisotropy . As expected , DCP1 S237D showed increased uptake of 343 FM4 - 64 at cell vertices in contrast to DCP1 S237A ( Fig . 5B ) . In parallel , we observed that 344 the two phospho - variants exerted growth reduction judged by the reduced elongation of 345 roots ( Fig . 5B ) . To consolidate this result , we used isoxaben , a cellulose biosynthesis 346 inhibitor that promotes isotropic growth ( Kirchhelle et al . , 2019 ) . Isoxaben did not affect 347 DCP1 localization at vertices ( Fig . 5C ) , suggesting that the DCP1 - vertex module once 348 established is not affected by the cell wall . On the contrary , isoxaben induced a marked 349 reduction of anisotropic cell expansion in cells lacking vertex DCP1 or in DCP1 - 350 GFP S237D lines , suggesting a link between vertex - specification by DCP1 and expansion 351 anisotropy ; we reconciled these findings using the weak allele dcp1 - 3 showing defects in 352 cell divisions and cell patterns ( Fig . 5D - E ) . Taken together , these results suggest that the 353 DCP1 - induced endocytosis - module at vertices is biologically significant . 354 Discussion 355 The alternative material properties of proteins inspire a re - evaluation of how cellular 356 condensates are organized in cells and impinge on biological processes . We propose a 357 framework describing how a cellular condensate composition can be determined . These 358 datasets exemplify how this condensate is dissolved and repurposed to some extent to 359 control a coordinate system in plants . We further ascribe biological significance to this 360 mechanism associating protein material properties at vertices with directional growth . We 361 show that plant PBs are based on low - valency meshworks , a feature that could confer the 362 necessary PBs plasticity which is compatible with the sessile lifestyle of plants and may 363 15 engage PBs in additional pathways . Furthermore , PBs show links to pectin and 364 vasculature development , processes that are inherently linked to membrane and cell wall 365 remodeling ( Wachsman et al . , 2020 ) . 366 The plasticity of PBs allows a dynamic “tug - of - war” between condensates ( the 367 PBs ) and membrane surfaces ( e . g . vertices ) for the same components ( e . g . DCP1 ) . The 368 subcellular positioning of DCP1 at certain membrane surfaces and in particular at vertices 369 may be instrumental in driving phase transitions , by reducing further the dimensions at 370 which protein molecules can diffuse thereby promoting condensation . This mechanism 371 further expands our comprehension of how condensation is promoted by reducing 372 diffusion dimensionality ( 3D - to - 2D ) from the cytoplasm to the plane of membranes 373 enhanced by additional local confinements from the vertex . Likewise , dynamic spatial 374 restriction influences the material states of condensates in neurons ( Gopal et al . , 2017 ) . 375 At the endoplasmic reticulum , animal PBs undergo fission at specialized contact 376 sites ( Lee et al . , 2020 ) . Although we cannot rule out that a similar process may exist in 377 plants , we offer an alternative slant by showing how components of condensates can 378 remodel membranes . This remodeling might be significant : in the light of evidence that 379 actin may not play a significant role at the initial phases of endocytosis in plants through 380 membrane - pulling forces ( Narasimhan et al . , 2020 ) , the interfacial energy produced by 381 DCP1 state transitions may cause liquid condensates to minimize their surface area and 382 supply the force for fission ( Stachowiak et al . , 2010 ; Yuan et al . , 2021 ) . Too little DCP1 383 at the plasma membrane may produce structures whose components turn over too rapidly 384 to drive productive endocytic events . By contrast , if the DCP1 network is too rigid , lipids 385 or downstream adaptors are unable to rearrange , stalling endocytosis . Liquid - like 386 interactions among membranes and DCP1 appear to optimize endocytosis . Likewise , in 387 animals endophilin at low concentrations can promote , while at higher concentrations 388 block endocytosis ( Renard et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , DCP1 may cooperate with other 389 proteins establishing non - equilibrium cocktails of endocytic modular machinery ( e . g . 390 DRPs or TPLATE ) ( Hohendahl et al . , 2017 ; Renard et al . , 2015 ) . We still though lack 391 mechanistic details of how this modular machinery functions but seems likely that DCP1 392 could function at two levels : lipid phasing and LLPS . While friction - driven scission that 393 16 depends on lipid phase separation and LLPS are distinct mechanisms ( Snead et al . , 2019 ) , 394 they may work together to build endocytic robustness . 395 Because it has been well documented that condensates liquid - to - solid transitions 396 depend on post - translational modifications , it is an intriguing possibility that a 397 combination of vertex confinement of DCP1 along with DCP1 dephosphorylation may 398 entropically favor these transitions as shown herein . Besides , cell edges act as sites of 399 microtubule or actin nucleation in plants ( Ambrose et al . , 2011 ) . Whether cytoskeleton 400 nucleation , phosphorylation , and state transitions at vertices are co - regulated is an open 401 question . There are also some thought - provoking parallels between plant vertex 402 condensation and the animal epithelial sheets , where tight junctions are formed by 403 condensates to maintain the epithelium ' s functions ( Beutel et al . , 2019a ) or principles of 404 actin nucleation in animals ( Case et al . , 2019 ) . 405 17 STAR METHODS 406 RESOURCE AVAILABILITY 407 Lead Contact 408 Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and 409 will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact , Panagiotis Moschou . 410 Materials availability 411 All unique / stable reagents generated in this study are available from the Lead Contact 412 without restriction . 413 Data and code availability 414 The datasets and code supporting the current study are available from the 415 corresponding author , Panagiotis Moschou on request . 416 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS 417 Plant material 418 All the plant lines used in this study were in the Arabidopsis Columbia - 0 ( Col - 0 ) ecotype 419 except the ones as indicated below .

The goldengate compatible TurboID 451 ( pro35S : sGFP - TurboID - FLAG ) has been previously described ( Arora et al . , 2020 ) . 452 Clonings were done according to standard goldengate cloning procedures . In brief , 453 TurboID was synthesized with BsaI overhands using the codon optimization tool of 454 Integrated DNA Technologies with codon - optimized expression in Arabidopsis 455 ( Eurofins ) . The coding sequence of DCP1 was PCR amplified using Phusion™ High - 456 Fidelity DNA Polymerase & dNTP Mix ( ThermoFisher Scientific , Cat # F530N ) with 457 GFP - DCP1 vector as a template . The p35S promoter carrying level 0 vector 458 ( pICSL13002 ) and all PCR parts with BsaI overhands were ligated to the Level1 / 2 459 vectors pICSL86900 and pICSL86922 . The sgRNAs used to target ECT4 ( AT1G55500 ) , 460 ECT6 ( AT3G17330 ) , and ECT8 ( AT1G79270 ) were created via the CHOPCHOP tool 461 19 ( https : / / chopchop . cbu . uib . no / # ) . For plasmid construction , goldengate cloning method 462 was used . First adding the appropriate overhangs and BsaI recognition site , as well as the 463 gRNA scaffold by PCR using 464 tgtggtctcaATTGTATGGAGCTATGGATTCGAAGTTTAAGAGCTATGCTGGAA , 465 tgtggtctcaATTGTATACGAGTGAACAAAATCGGTTTAAGAGCTATGCTGGAA , 466 and tgtggtctcaATTGAGGCAGTGACCTTAGCAAGGTTTAAGAGCTATGCTGGAA 467 for ECT4 , 6 , and 8 respectively as forward primers and 468 tgtggtctcaAGCGAAAAAAAGCACCGACTC as the reverse .

For clonings , the bacterial strains NEB10 ( New England 472 Biolabs # C3019H ) or NEB stable ( New England Biolabs # C3040H ; CRISPR constructs ) , 473 were used . 474 Protoplast isolation and transfection 475 Protoplasts were isolated from 10 days old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings . First seedlings 476 were dissected and incubated in enzyme solution with gently shaking ( 40 rpm ) for 2 h in 477 light at RT . The protoplasts were collected by centrifugation at 4 o C , 100 g for 3 min , and 478 the pellet was washed twice with W5 solution and incubated on ice for 1 h . Transfection 479 was conducted following a PEG - mediated method as described in ( Yoo et al . , 2007 ) , and 480 transfected protoplasts were incubated in the dark at RT for 18 - 24 hours before the 481 confocal observation . 482 APEAL two - step purification 483 After 24 h 50 μ M biotin ( diluted 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM MES pH 5 . 7 ) , 2 . 5 ml pulverized 484 Arabidopsis leaves or seedlings ( ~ 0 . 5 g FW ) were extracted in 5 ml Extraction Buffer 485 ( EB ; 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 1 486 mM DTT , 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) IGEPAL CA - 630 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and Protease inhibitor Cocktail 487 ( 1 : 100 dilution , Sigma - Aldrich , P9599 ) . Extracts were incubated on a shaker at 4 °C for 488 10 min and then centrifuged at 4 °C , 13 , 000 g for 30 min . Five ml clarified supernatants 489 were incubated with 100 μ L magnetic FLAG beads ( Sigma - Aldrich , A8592 ) for 2 h at 4 490 °C with gentle rotation , then the FLAG beads were precipitated with DynaMag™ - 2 491 20 Magnet ( ThermoFisher Scientific , 112321D ) and washed as indicated later . The 492 supernatants ( “flow - through1” ) were filtered through PD - 10 columns ( Cytiva , 17085101 ) , 493 then the biotin - depleted “flow - though2” was incubated with 100 μ L Dynabeads™ M - 280 494 Streptavidin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , 11205D ) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation . The 495 FLAG beads and Dynabeads were washed 5 times with 1 ml EB and 8 times with 1 ml 50 496 mM NH 4 HCO 3 ( 5 min per each time ) . Then the beads were collected on a magnetic rack 497 and subjected to on - beads digestion followed by mass spectrometry . For western blot 498 analysis , the proteins were eluted from the FLAG beads with 60 μ L 2x Laemmlie buffer 499 ( Bio - rad , 1610747 ) supplemented with 10 mM DTT and incubated at 95 °C for 10 min . 500 The proteins were eluted from the Dynabeads with 60 μ L 2x Laemmlie buffer 501 supplemented with 5 mM Biotin , 2 % ( w / v ) SDS , and 10 mM DTT and incubated at 95 502 °C for 20 min . 503 T - RIP method 504 All materials were RNase - free . Fifty mg sterilized seeds from each line were sown on 505 half - strength MS plates . After four - day , the plates were submerged in 50 ml of 50 μ M 506 biotin ( in 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM MES pH 5 . 7 ) for 1 min under vacuum . The biotin 507 solution was removed from the plates and were put back in the growth chamber . After 24 508 h incubation , the plates were treated with heat stress ( 37 °C , 2 h ) . Around 1 - 2 g fresh 509 weight was harvested in 1 % ( v / v ) formaldehyde ( FA ) solution and a 15 min vacuum was 510 applied . FA was quenched by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0 . 125 M for 5 511 min under vacuum . The plant material was rinsed and dried twice with RNase - free H 2 O 512 and pulverized in liquid N 2 . Proteins were extracted as described for APEAL ; the 513 extraction buffer was supplemented though with 20 U / ml RNase inhibitor ( ThermoFisher 514 Scientific , EO0381 ) . The supernatant was loaded on the PD - 10 column for the removal of 515 the excess biotin and incubated with equilibrated 100 μL Dynabeads™ MyOne™ 516 Streptavidin ( ThermoFisher Scientific , 65601 ) for 2 - 3 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation . The 517 beads were collected with a magnetic rack and washed four times with extraction buffer 518 and two times with dilution buffer ( extraction buffer without detergent ) . Then RNA - 519 protein complexes were eluted from the beads with 100 μL protease buffer ( 0 , 5 mg / ml 520 Proteinase K , 20 U / ml RNase inhibitor in 30 mM Tris – HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) at 55 °C for 30 min . 521 21 RNA was extracted from the eluted beads with phenol : chloroform : iso - amyl alcohol 522 ( 25 : 24 : 1 ) ( v / v / v ) ( VWR , 136112 - 00 - 0 ) , followed by precipitation with 1 : 1 ( v / v ) 523 isopropanol with 0 . 1 volume of 3M NaAc , pH 5 . 2 and 2 μL Glycoblue ( ThermoFisher 524 Scientific , AM9515 ) for 1 h . After centrifugation at 4 °C , 16 , 000 g for 20 min , the blue 525 pellet was washed twice with 75 % ( v / v ) ethanol . Air - dried pellet was resuspended into 15 526 μL of DNase - , RNase - , and protease - free water . The concentration of RNA was 527 determined by Qubit ® RNA HS Assay Kit ( New England BioNordika BioLab , Q32852 ) . 528 All of the RIP - RNA samples were treated with DNase I ( ThermoFisher Scientific , 529 EN0521 ) and Ribosomal RNA depletion ( RiboMinus™ Plant Kit ( ThermoFisher 530 Scientific , A1083808 ) . The RNA was measured with Qubit® RNA HS Assay Kits again 531 and libraries were prepared with NEBNext ® Ultra™ II RNA Library Prep with Sample 532 Purification Beads ( Invitrogen Life Technologies ( Ambion Applied Biosystem ) , E7775S ) 533 and NEBNext ® Multiplex Oligos for Illumina ® ( Dual Index Primers Set 1 ) ( New England 534 BioNordika BioLab , E7600S ) . cDNA library quality was monitored with Agilent DNA 535 7500 Kit ( Agilent Technologies Sweden AB , 5067 - 1506 ) . cDNA libraries were 536 sequenced with a paired - end sequencing strategy to produce 2 × 150 - bp reads using 537 Novogen sequencers and 20 million reads per sample ( Novogene , England ) . 538 Immunoblotting 539 Infiltrated N . benthamiana tobacco leaves or Arabidopsis leaves and seedlings were 540 harvested and proteins extracted . The tissue samples were flash - frozen in liquid Ν 2 and 541 kept at - 80°C until further processing . The samples were crushed using a liquid Ν 2 - 542 cooled mortar and pestle and the crushed material was transferred to a 1 . 5 ml tube . 543 Extraction buffer ( EB ; 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 2 544 mM EDTA , 5 mM DTT , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , Protease Inhibitor 545 Cocktail ( Sigma - Aldrich , P9599 ) , and 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) IGEPAL CA - 630 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was 546 added . The lysates were pre - cleared by centrifugation at 16 , 000 × g at 4 °C , for 15 min , 547 and the supernatant was transferred to a new 1 . 5 ml tube . This step was repeated two 548 times and the protein concentration was determined by the RC DC Protein Assay Kit II 549 ( Bio - Rad , 5000122 ) . Two x Laemmli buffer was added and equivalent amounts of 550 protein ( ~ 30 μ g ) were separated by SDS - PAGE ( 1 . 0 mm thick 4 to 12 % gradient 551 22 polyacrylamide Criterion Bio - Rad ) in MOPS buffer ( Bio - Rad ) at 150 V . Subsequently , 552 proteins were transferred onto a Polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ; Bio - Rad ) membrane 553 with 0 . 22 μ m pore size . The membrane was blocked with 3 % ( w / v ) BSA fraction V 554 ( ThermoScientific ) in Phosphate Buffer Saline - Tween 20 ( PBS - T ) for 1 h at room 555 temperature ( RT ) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated 556 primary antibody for 2 h at RT ( or primary antibody for 2 h at RT and following with 557 corresponding secondary antibody for 2 h at RT ) . The following antibodies were used : 558 streptavidin - HRP ( Sigma - Aldrich ; 1 : 25 , 000 ) , FLAG - HRP ( Sigma - Aldrich , A8592 , 559 1 : 2000 ) , rat anti - tubulin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , 1 / 1000 ) , rabbit anti - GFP ( Millipore , 560 AB10145 , 1 : 10 , 000 ) , anti - mouse ( Amersham ECL Mouse IgG , HRP - linked whole Ab 561 ( from sheep ) , NA931 , 1 : 10 , 000 ) , anti - rabbit ( Amersham ECL Rabbit IgG , HRP - linked 562 whole Ab ( from donkey ) , NA934 , 1 : 10 , 000 ) , anti - rat ( IRDye ® 800 CW Goat anti - Rat IgG 563 ( H + L ) , LI - COR , 925 - 32219 , 1 / 10000 ) and anti - rabbit ( IRDye ® 800 CW Goat anti - 564 Rabbit IgG , LI - COR , 926 - 3221 , 1 / 10 , 000 ) . Chemiluminescence was detected with ECL 565 Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent ( Cytiva , GERPN2232 ) and SuperSignal™ 566 West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate ( ThermoFisher Scientific , 34094 ) . The 567 tubulin bands were visualized using an Odyssey infrared imaging system ( LI - COR ) . 568 On - beads digestion 569 After immunoprecipitation and extensive wash with 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 , 0 . 1 μg trypsin in 570 10 μL of 2 mM CaCl 2 , 10 % ( v / v ) acetonitrile , and 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 was added to beads 571 and incubated at 37 o C overnight . Fresh trypsin ( 0 . 1 μg ) in 10 μL 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 was 572 added to beads and incubated for another 4 h . The digested supernatant was transferred 573 into a clean centrifuge tube and acetonitrile was evaporated under vacuum . The samples 574 were then acidified and desalted using a C18 stage tip before being analyzed by nano - 575 liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry . 576 Liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry 577 Samples were analyzed by LC - MS using Nano LC - MS / MS ( Dionex Ultimate 3000 578 RLSCnano System ) interfaced with Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer ( ThermoFisher 579 Scientific ) . Samples were loaded onto a fused silica trap column Acclaim PepMap 100 , 580 75 μm x 2 cm ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . After washing for 5 min at 5 µL / min with 0 . 1 % 581 23 ( v / v ) trifluoroacetic acid ( TFA ) , the trap column was brought in - line with an analytical 582 column ( Nanoease MZ peptide BEH C18 , 130 A , 1 . 7 μm , 75 μm x 250 mm , Waters ) for 583 LC - MS / MS . Peptides were fractionated at 300 nL / min using a segmented linear gradient 584 4 - 15 % B in 30min ( where A : 0 . 2 % formic acid , and B : 0 . 16 % formic acid , 80 % 585 acetonitrile ) , 15 - 25 % B in 40min , 25 - 50 % B in 44 min , and 50 - 90 % B in 11 min . Solution 586 B then returned at 4 % for 5 min for the next run . The scan sequence began with an MS1 587 spectrum ( Orbitrap analysis , resolution 120 , 000 , scan range from M / Z 350 – 1600 , 588 automatic gain control ( AGC ) target 1E6 , maximum injection time 100 ms ) . The top S ( 3 589 sec ) and dynamic exclusion of 60 sec were used for the selection of Parent ions for 590 MS / MS . Parent masses were isolated in the quadrupole with an isolation window of 1 . 4 591 m / z , automatic gain control ( AGC ) target 1E5 , and fragmented with higher - energy 592 collisional dissociation with a normalized collision energy of 30 % . The fragments were 593 scanned in Orbitrap with a resolution of 30 , 000 . The MS / MS scan range was determined 594 by the charge state of the parent ion but the lower limit was set at 100 amu . 595 Database Search 596 LC - MS / MS data were analyzed with Maxquant ( version 1 . 6 . 10 . 43 ) with the Andromeda 597 search engine . The type of LC - MS run was set to 1 ( label - free ) . LC - MS data were 598 searched against TAIR plus a common contaminant database . Protease was set as Trypsin 599 that allowed 2 miss - cuts . N - terminal acetylation and oxidation at Methionine were set as 600 variable modification . Maximum 2 variable modification was allowed . iBAQ / LFQ values 601 were also determined and used for protein validation . Protein and peptide FDR were set 602 at 1 % . Reverse hit and common contaminants , as well as proteins identified only by 603 modified sites , were removed . 604 Domain prediction and annotation 605 Except for the prion - like domains ( PLD ) , all the other domains were predicted by 606 SMART ( http : / / smart . emblheidelberg . de / ) or NCBI conserved domain ( https : / / 607 www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / Structure / cdd / wrpsb . cgi ) . The PLD was identified using the 608 PLAAC ( http : / / plaac . wi . mit . edu / ) . The minimal contiguous PLD length for the hidden 609 Markov model was set to 60 and the background frequencies from Saccharomyces 610 cerevisiae were set to 100 % . The domain structures of the proteins were generated using 611 24 Illustrator for Biological Sequences . The disorder tendency was predicted by IUPred 612 ( http : / / iupred . enzim . hu / ) . To plot the sliding net charge , the sliding window was set to 20 613 amino acids . 614 Phenotypic analysis , and drug treatments 615 For quantification of phenotypes , seedlings were sterilized and grown on half - strength 616 MS medium plates with 1 % ( w / v ) sucrose . For a given genotype , differential contrast 617 interference ( DIC ) images were captured on a Leica DM2500 , Leica DM6B , or Leica 618 DM6000 . To define root length , images were captured from the plates using a Leica 619 DM6000 with a motorized stage and computationally compiled together . Root length or 620 size was determined using Image J / Fiji ( National Institute of Health ) . For 1 , 6 - hexanediol 621 treatments , 10 % ( v / v ) aqueous solution was used . The 50 mg / ml stock solution of 622 Methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( MβCD ) was prepared in deionized water . The stock solutions of 623 50 mM biotin , 100 mM Phenylarsine oxide ( PAO ) , 10 mM Cytochalasin D ( Cyto D ) , 33 624 mM LY - 294002 hydrochloride , 100 mM Amiprofos methyl ( APM ) , 10 mM Latrunculin 625 B ( Lat B ) , 2 mM FM4 - 64 , 33 mM Wortmannin ( Wm ) , 10 mM Paclitaxel ( Taxol ) , 100 626 mM Oryzalin , 2 mM Concanamycin A ( Con A ) , 50 mM Brefeldin A ( BFA ) , 50 mM 627 MG132 , 100 mM E64D , 100 mg / ml Cycloheximide ( CHX ) , 50 mM 1 - 628 aminocyclopropane - 1 - carboxylic acid ( ACC ) were dissolved in DMSO and 40 mM 629 Isoxaben in ethanol . These inhibitors or drugs were diluted in a half - strength MS medium 630 with corresponding concentration and the final DMSO concentration was ≤0 . 1 % ( v / v ) in 631 all experimental analyses . Vertically grown 4 - 5 - d - old Arabidopsis seedlings were 632 incubated in a half - strength liquid MS medium containing corresponding drugs for each 633 specific time course treatment as indicated . 634 Agrobacterium - mediated transient transformation of Nicotiana benthamiana 635 Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown under normal light and dark regimes at 25°C 636 and 70 % relative humidity1 . 3 - to 4 - weeks old N . benthamiana plants were watered from 637 the bottom ~ 2h before infiltration . Transformed Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 638 Rif R ( pMP90 ) or GV3101 Rif R harboring the constructs of interest were used to infiltrate 639 tobacco leaves and used for transient expression of binary constructs by Agrobacterium 640 tumefaciens - mediated transient transformation of lower epidermal leaf cells . Transformed 641 25 Agrobacterium tumefaciens were grown for ~ 20h in a shaking incubator ( 200 rpm ) at 642 28°C in 5 mL of yeast extract broth ( YEB ) medium ( 5 g / L beef extract , 1 g / L yeast 643 extract , 5 g / L peptone , 0 . 5 g / L MgCl 2 , and 15 g / L bacterial agar ) , supplemented with 644 appropriate antibiotics ( i . e . 100 g / L spectinomycin ) . After incubation , the bacterial 645 culture was transferred to 15 ml Falcon tubes and centrifuged ( 10 min , 5000 g ) . The 646 pellets were washed with 5 mL of the infiltration buffer ( 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM MES pH 647 5 . 7 ) and the final pellet was resuspended in the infiltration buffer supplemented with 100 648 μM acetosyringone . The bacterial suspension was diluted with supplemented infiltration 649 buffer to adjust the inoculum concentration to a final OD 600 value of 0 . 2 - 1 . 0 . The 650 inoculum was incubated for 2 h at RT before injecting and delivered to tobacco by gentle 651 pressure infiltration of the lower epidermis leaves ( fourth and older true leaves were used , 652 and about 4 / 5 - 1 / 1 of their full size ) with a 1 mL hypodermic syringe without a needle . 653 Bifluorescence complementation ( BiFC ) 654 The BiFC assay was done in WT tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ) plants . Excitation 655 wavelengths and emission filters were 514 nm / band - pass 530 - 550 nm for YFP , 561 656 nm / band - pass 600 - 630 nm for RFP , and 488 nm / band - pass 650 - 710 nm for chloroplast 657 auto - fluorescence . 658 CRISPR application and protoplast transformation 659 Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts via PEG transformation as described previously ( Wu 660 et al . , 2009 ) . After 16h transformation , protoplasts were observed with a Zeiss LSM780 661 laser scanning confocal microscope using 40× / 1 . 2 W C - Apochromat in multi - track 662 channel mode . Empty vectors were used as controls . 663 TIRFM imaging and tracking analyses 664 TIRF microscopy images were acquired using MetaMorph software on an Olympus IX - 665 81 microscope . A DV2 image splitter ( MAG Biosystems ) was used to separate GFP and 666 RFP emission signals . Time - lapse movies were obtained with , 100 ms intervals . For 667 MSD analysis , 30 - s - long movies with 100 ms intervals and 200 ms exposure were used . 668 Particle tracking was limited to the amount of time that plasma membrane remained at 669 the focal plane ; the median track length was 2 , 000 frames , corresponding to 3 . 5 s of 670 26 imaging . The tracking of particles was performed with the Mosaic suite of FIJI or 671 NanoTrackJ / TrackMate , using the following typical parameters : radius 3 of fluorescence 672 intensity , a link range of 1 , cutoff of 0 . 1 % , and a maximum displacement of 8 px , 673 assuming Brownian dynamics . 674 Quantification of fluorescent intensity and FRAP 675 To create the most comparable lines to measure the fluorescence intensity of reporters in 676 multiple mutant backgrounds , we crossed homozygous mutant bearing the marker with 677 either a WT plant ( outcross to yield progeny heterozygous for the recessive mutant alleles 678 and the reporter ) or crossed to a mutant only plant ( backcross to yield progeny 679 homozygous for the recessive mutant alleles and heterozygous for the reporter ) . 680 Fluorescence was measured as a mean integrated density in regions of interest ( ROIs ) 681 with the subtraction of the background ( a proximal region that was unbleached and had 682 less signal intensity than the signal of the ROI region ) . FRAP mode of Zeiss 780 ZEN 683 software was set up for the acquisition of 3 pre - bleach images , one bleach scan , and 96 684 post - bleach scans ( or more ) . Bleaching was performed using 488 , 514 , and 561 nm laser 685 lines at 100 % transmittance and 20 - 40 iterations depending on the region and the axial 686 resolution ( iterations increased in deeper tissues to compensate for the increased light 687 scattering ) . In FRAP the width of the bleached ROI was set at 2 - 10 µm . Pre - and post - 688 bleach scans were at minimum possible laser power ( 0 . 8 % transmittance ) for the 458 nm 689 or 514 nm ( 4 . 7 % ) and 5 % for 561 nm ; 512 x 512 8 - bit pixel format ; pinhole of 181 μ m 690 ( > 2 Airy units ) , and zoom factor of 2 . 0 . The background values were subtracted from the 691 fluorescence recovery values , and the resulting values were normalized by the first post - 692 bleach time point and divided by the maximum fluorescent time - point set maximum 693 intensity as 1 . The objective used was a plan - apochromat 20x with NA = 0 . 8 M27 ( Zeiss ) . 694 The following settings were used for photobleaching DCP1 : 10 - 20 iterations for DCP1 - 695 GFP ; 10 to 60 s per frame ; 100 % transmittance with the 458 - to 514 - nm laser lines of an 696 argon laser . Pre - and post bleach scans were at minimum possible laser power ( 1 . 4 to 697 20 % transmittance ) for the 488 nm and 0 % for all other laser lines , 512x512 pixel format , 698 and zoom factor of 5 . 1 . The fluorescence intensity recovery values were determined , then 699 27 the background values were subtracted from the fluorescence recovery values , and the 700 resulting values were normalized against the first post bleach time point . 701 Immunocytochemistry and imaging 702 Immunocytochemistry was done as described previously ( Moschou et al . , 2016 ) . The 703 primary antibody used was rabbit anti - PAT1 ( diluted 1 : 500 ) ( Roux et al . , 2015 ) , rat anti - 704 tubulin YL1 / 2 ( 1 : 200 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , mouse anti - DCP1 ( diluted 1 : 100 ; 705 prepared herein ) , anti - HA ( diluted 1 : 300 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . In brief , specimens were 706 washed three times for 90 min in PBS - T and incubated overnight with anti - rabbit 707 fluorescein isothiocyanate - conjugated ( FITC ) secondary antibody ( Jackson 708 ImmunoResearch , 711 - 095 - 152 ) diluted 1 : 200 - 250 , DyLight™ 549 AffiniPure Fab 709 Fragment Rabbit Anti - Mouse IgG ( H + L ) ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , 315 - 507 - 003 ) , 710 Rhodamine Red™ - X ( RRX ) AffiniPure Donkey Anti - Rabbit IgG ( H + L ) ( Jackson 711 ImmunoResearch , 711 - 295 - 152 ) , Tetramethylrhodamine ( TRITC ) Donkey Anti - Rabbit 712 IgG ( H + L ) ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , 711 - 026 - 152 ) diluted 1 : 200 - 250 . After washing 713 in the PBS - T and incubated with DAPI ( 1 ug / ml ) , specimens were mounted in 714 Vectashield ( Vector Laboratories ) medium and observed within 48 h . 715 Visualization of networks and analyses 716 Cytoscape 3 . 5 . 1 was used . Tab - delimited files containing the input data were uploaded . 717 Unless otherwise indicated , the default layout was an edge - weighted spring embedded 718 layout , with the NormSpec used as edge weight . Nodes were manually re - arranged from 719 this layout to increase visibility and highlight specific proximity interactions . The layout 720 was exported as a PDF and eventually converted to a . TIFF file . 721 Protein Expression and Purification 722 The DCP1 cDNA in pGAT4 ( hexahistidine tagged vector ) were transformed in BL21 723 ( DE3 ) Rosetta or BL21 ( DE3 ) Rosetta II Escherichia coli cells . Bacterial cultures were 724 grown in 800 mL of Luria Bertani ( LB ) medium supplemented with 100 mg L - 1 of 725 ampicillin and 25 mg L - 1 of chloramphenicol . Protein expression was induced at OD 600 = 726 0 . 5 with 0 . 05 to 1 mM isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . After 3 h the cells 727 were harvested by centrifugation at 2 , 500 g for 20 min at RT and frozen overnight at - 728 28 80°C . Preparation of hexahistidine - tagged recombinant proteins was performed according 729 to manufacturer instructions in Tris buffers ( Qiagen , 30210 ) . Expression levels of 730 proteins were estimated by CBB stainings in SDS - PAGE or on immunoblots using anti - 731 his antibodies . The proteins were dialyzed overnight in assay buffers ( 2 L ) . 732 Phase separation assay 733 Purified recombinant DCP1 ( 1 - 50 μ M ) was incubated for 3 h in Liquid - Liquid Phase 734 separation ( LLPS ) assay buffer ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 735 2 mM DTT ) . As a crowding agent PEG3000 10 % ( w / v ) was added in the aforementioned 736 buffer , while inhibition of the phase separation properties was done with the addition of 737 5 % ( v / v ) 1 . 6 - hexanediol . Samples were observed under the 63x NA = 1 . 4 oil - corrected 738 objective of an SP8 confocal microscope using coated Silane - Prep Slides ( Sigma - Aldrich 739 # S4651 - 72EA ) . 740 Protein labeling 741 The dyes used for labeling were Alexa Fluor™ 647 C2 Maleimide and Alexa Fluor™ 742 555 C2 Maleimide ( ThermoFischer Scientific ) . Alexa Fluor® 647 is a bright , far - red 743 fluorescent dye with excitation ideally suited for the 594 nm or 633 nm laser lines 744 whereas Alexa Fluor® 555 is a bright orange dye . The dyes were dissolved in water - free 745 DMSO at a concentration of 1mM . After the RBP1 or DCP1 protein isolation with 746 histidine - affinity chromatography , the proteins were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris - HCl 747 pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl . Proteins were partially labeled in solution in a ratio of 1 mol 748 protein to 0 . 1 mol ( 1 : 10 labeled / unlabeled ) of dye for 15 min on ice . The labeled proteins 749 were kept at 4 o C and used within the next 2 days . 750 Preparation of liposomes 751 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycerol - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycerol - 3 - phospho - 752 L - serine ( DOPS ) , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycerol - 3 - phospho - ( 1 ' - myo - inositol - 4 ' , 5 ' - 753 bisphosphate ) ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) and 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycerol - 3 - [ ( N - ( 5 - amino - 1 - 754 carboxypentyl ) iminodiacetic acid ) succinyl ] ( DGS - NTA ( Ni ) ) lipids were purchased from 755 Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , Al , USA ) . DGS - NTA served as an anchor to saturate 756 liposomes with either DCP1 or RBP1 , as the latter could not bind liposomes . Dipalmitoyl 757 29 phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) lipids were from Echelon Biosciences 758 Incorporated ( EBI ) . Lyophilized lipids were dissolved in 1 : 1 chloroform : methanol mixed 759 in glass flasks in the desired amount . The organic solvent was first evaporated under a 760 gentle stream of nitrogen while gently turning the flask to form a thin lipid film onto the 761 wall of the flask . The lipid film was further dried with liquid nitrogen for 30 min 762 minimum . Lipid films were hydrated in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 763 ( Merck ) , 150 mM NaCl at a final concentration of 2 mg / ml . After vortexing for 30 min , 764 the resulting multilamellar vesicle solutions were extruded 25 times through a 765 polycarbonate membrane with 50 or 200 nm nominal pore diameter ( LiposoFast , 766 Avestin ) leading to a stock solution of unilamellar vesicles which were stored at 4 o C and 767 used for 5 days at maximum . 768 Liposome - protein binding assays 769 For the liposome - protein pull - down assays , 25 μL of Small Unilamellar Vesicles ( SUVs , 770 2 mg / ml ) were used combined with ~ 500 ng of the protein of interest . Before binding the 771 proteins were centrifuged at 16 , 000 g , 4 o C , for 5 min , to avoid precipitates . We 772 combined 25 μL of protein mix with 25 μL liposome suspension and incubated it on an 773 orbital shaker platform for 30 - 45 min at RT . The binding buffer consisted of 150 mM 774 KCl , 25 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM EDTA . The samples were 775 centrifuged at 16 , 000 g for 30 min at RT , and supernatants were collected ( 16 . 7 μL of 4× 776 Laemmli sample buffer to a supernatant fraction ) and resuspended the liposome pellet in 777 300 – 500 μL 1× binding buffer . The centrifugation was repeated in the same conditions 778 and the liposomes - protein pellets were resuspended in 33 μL 4x Laemmli buffer . All 779 samples were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and loaded 10 μL on SDS - PAGE for Western 780 blot analysis . 781 Detection of RNA molecules by smFISH 782 Probes were selected following the criteria as 1 ) roughly 18 – 22 bases long , 2 ) GC content 783 close to 45 % . Probes had at least two nucleotides of space between their target regions . 784 The Stellaris Probe Designer version 4 . 2 from Biosearch Technologies was used for 785 probe design and ordering ( https : / / www . biosearchtech . com / stellaris - designer ) . 786 Localization was performed following the protocols from Stellaris RNA fish ( Protocol 787 30 for Arabidopsis root meristem ) and ( Duncan et al . , 2016 ) . Briefly , the roots of 4 to 5 - day - 788 old seedlings were cut from the plates and fixed with 4 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) 789 for 30 min at room temperature . After washing twice with 1x PBS for 5 min per wash , 790 the roots were placed onto poly - L - lysine slides and squashed with the coverslip . Then the 791 slides were submerged in liquid N 2 for 5 s , and the coverslip was removed from the slides 792 using a razor blade . The slides were dried out completely ( around 30 min ) and then 793 incubated in 70 % ethanol for 1 h at RT . Samples were washed 2x with wash buffer ( 10 % 794 formamide and 2 × SSC ) , 5 min per wash . Then slides were incubated with 100 ul 250 795 nM of probes ( in hybridization solution : 10 % dextran sulfate , 2 × SSC , and 10 % 796 formamide ) for 4h or overnight hybridization at 37 °C in the dark . Samples were washed 797 twice with wash buffer for 5 min each . Slides were incubated with 100 ul nuclear stain 798 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ; 100 ng ml −1 ) for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark . 799 Excess DAPI was remov ed and 100 μL 2 × SSC was added and then washed away . A 800 drop of Vectashield antifade Mountant was added and sealed with coverslip and nail 801 polish . A Zeiss 800 confocal microscope was used for imaging , using a 63x NA = 1 . 4 802 water - corrected immersion objective and the wide - field mode was used to obtain all 803 images in standard settings . The following wavelengths were used for fluorescence 804 detection : for probes labeled with Quasar 570 an excitation line of 561 nm was used and 805 the signal was detected at wavelengths 570 - 640 nm ; for DCP1 - GFP an excitation line of 806 488 nm was used and the signal was detected at wavelengths of 530 - 550 nm ; for DAPI an 807 excitation line of 405 nm was used and the signal was detected at wavelengths of 420 - 808 460 nm . 809 In silico Data analyses 810 For MS enrichments we followed the following criteria . i ) high - confidence interactions 811 ( log 2 FC > 1 . 5 ) appearing in two biological replicates , and ii ) assigned LFQ ( relative label - 812 free quantification ) and iBAQ ( intensity - based absolute quantification ) upon the 813 semiquantitative peptide enrichments and reiterated interactions ( Datasets in File S10 and 814 S11 ) . We did not base our analyses on biotinylated peptides , as both were anticipated and 815 indeed found in AP - and PDL - steps ( Arora et al . , 2020 ) . Significant changes were 816 determined via volcano plot using Student’s t - test and a permutation - based FDR ( α = 817 31 0 . 05 ; Perseus v1 . 6 . 2 . 3 ; Max Planck Institute , Martinsried , Germany ) . For interspecies 818 PLD analysis , we used PLAAC ( http : / / plaac . wi . mit . edu / ) to predict intrinsically 819 disordered regions in proteins’ sequences encoded by a list of selected Arabidopsis genes 820 ( https : / / www . arabidopsis . org / ) and their homologs in Homo sapiens , Antirrhinum majus , 821 Brassica oleracea , Solanum tuberosum , and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . The sequences 822 of homologs genes have been retrieved using protein - protein Blast 823 ( https : / / blast . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / ) . Then , the number of amino acids ( FInumaa ) that are 824 involved in the formation of PLDs and the total number of amino acids for each gene 825 were plotted . For RNAs that are enriched in PBs , we used log2 ( DCP1 / GFP ) value ( from 826 the RNA - seq dataset ) , as an indicator of enrichment of each RNA with PBs . The source 827 of Dataset , used for each graph , is written on the corresponding graphs’ caption . The 828 “Fold _ enrichment” values from the graphs , that are associated with m 6 A modifications , 829 are referred to as the average “Fold _ enrichment” value of each RNA from the given 830 dataset ( available on https : / / repicmod . uchicago . edu / repic / download . php ) . The 831 “Fold _ enrichment” values indicate the statistical importance of the detected RNA to be 832 methylated to one or more sites . Seedlings’ protein and RNA levels have been calculated , 833 summing the corresponding iBAQ and TPM values ratio from each seedling tissue 834 referred to the source ( Mergner et al . , 2020 ) . For combined translatome analysis as a 835 proxy of relative mRNA translation , RMA ( Robust Multi - Array ) values , normalized 836 signal values from microarrays ( Raw intensities summarized by Robust Multi - Array 837 method ) , were retrieved using Bioconductor - R ( version : 4 . 1 . 0 ) from ( Yángüez et al . , 838 2013 ) . RMA values used in graphs are referring to the average RMA values of two 839 experimental replicates . Finally , information about the total length or the length of 5’ and 840 3’ UTR have been retrieved from the TAIR database ( https : / / www . arabidopsis . org / ) and 841 plotted against the corresponding log2 ( DCP1 / GFP ) values . 842 Quantification and Statistics 843 All statistical data show the mean ± s . d . of at least two ( MS and RNA - seq ) to three 844 biologically independent experiments or samples . Statistical analyses were performed in 845 JMP , GraphPad ( https : / / graphpad . com / ) , or R studio ( R - project . org ) . Each data set was 846 tested whether it followed normal distribution by using the Shapiro normality test . For 847 32 tests involving pairwise comparisons , Student’s t - test , Kruskal - Wallis , or Wilcoxon tests 848 ( or as indicated ) were used to testing significance . The significance threshold was set at 849 p < 0 . 05 ( significance claim ) and the exact values are shown in graphs . N corresponds to 850 biological replicates , and “n” to technical replicates or population size . Graphs were 851 generated by using Microsoft Excel or R . Details of the statistical tests applied , including 852 the choice of statistical method , and the exact number of “n” is indicated in the 853 corresponding figure legend . In box plots or box plots combined with violin plots , upper 854 and lower box boundaries represent the first and third quantiles , respectively , horizontal 855 lines mark the median , and whiskers mark the highest and lowest values . Image analyses 856 and intensity measurements were done using FIJI v . 1 . 49 software ( rsb . info . nih . gov / ij ) . 857 The intensity of the fluorescence signal was measured as the Integrated Density in a 858 region of interest . The dwell time rate of tagged proteins in FRAP experiments was 859 calculated by the single exponential fit ( Moschou et al . , 2016 ) . Co - localization was 860 analyzed using Pearson statistics ( Spearman or Manders analyses produced similar results 861 or trends ) ( French et al . , 2008 ) . GO term analysis was performed using a combination of 862 Panther database and BioConductor package in R . Images were prepared by Adobe 863 Photoshop v . 2021 ( Adobe ) . Graphs were prepared using GraphPad or R and redrawn on 864 Adobe Illustrator v . CS6 ( Adobe ) or exported as metafiles . Curve Fitting 865 ( monoexponential fits ) and statistical analyses were performed with JMP v . 9 or 11 866 ( www . jmp . com ) . Time series movies were compressed , corrected , and exported as . avi 867 extension files . The unspecific fluorescence decay was corrected using FIJI v . 1 . 49 868 software and default options using the bleaching correction tool . Videos were digitally 869 enhanced with FIJI implemented filters , correcting noise using the Gaussian blur option 870 and pixel width set to 1 . 0 . In addition , the following software was used : ImageJ version 871 1 . 52 ( Fiji , https : / / fiji . sc / ) ; Mascot Distiller software ( version 2 . 4 . 3 . 3 ; Matrix Science ) ; 872 Mascot Daemon interface ( version 2 . 4 , Matrix Science ) ; R ( http : / / www .

SmFISH of selected mRNAs confirms TRIP results ( A ) Colocalization efficiency between PBs ( p35S : GFP - DCP1 expressing root cells ) and the enriched EFB2 , DFL1 , RAP2 . 4 , and PP2A mRNAs in smFISH ( root cells ) . As a marker for PBs , DCP1 - GFP ( green puncta ) was used and mRNA puncta are in red . smFISH confirmed the enrichment of EBF2 , DFL1 , and RAP2 . 4 and depletion of PP2A transcripts in PBs labeled with DCP1 - GFP . DAPI - stained nuclei are in violet ( left from the dashed line ; on the right side , different cells are depicted ) . Lower ( EBF2 ) : treatment of cells with 100 uM 1 - aminocyclopropane - 1 - carboxylic acid ( ACC ) for 2h led to increased colocalization of EBF2 mRNA with PBs ; note also the increased signal in the nucleus and the proximity of PBs to the nuclear transcripts ( yellow arrowhead ; nucleus / DCP1 - GFP ) .

Controls show a cell lacking mRNA puncta ( DOT1 ; lack of RNA signal in the meristematic root cells under our conditions ) , a cell expressing free GFP ( lack of cellular green puncta ; minus GFP - DCP1 signal ) , and a cell that did not express DCP1 - GFP but with a positive granular signal from RAP2 . 4 . ( B ) Cartoon showing the strategy for colocalization analyses between GFP - DCP1 and mRNAs smFISH signal . Three major cases of colocalization or exclusion are shown ( I - III ) . Interestingly , in many cases mRNAs were located in proximity to the PBs , especially when PBs attained large size , suggesting that these mRNA molecules may represent degradation intermediates ( II ) . Yet , these cases were not considered as colocalization since widefield microscopy may underestimate distances . Accordingly , the RNA degradation machinery presumably is in proximity to the PBs ( Yu et al . , 2019 ) . ( C ) Colocalization efficiency calculated as described in ( B ) ( number of RNA smFISH positive puncta in PBs / total number of RNA puncta ) . Due to technical limitations , we could not do experiments at HS , as post - fixation with the smFISH protocol the DCP1 - GFP foci were not retained . As a positive control , we confirmed the relocalization of EBF2 to PBs upon ethylene 57 perception ( Li et al . , 2015 ; Merchante et al . , 2015 ) . Data are means±SD ( N = 2 biological replicates , n = 10 cells ) . 58 Figure S5 . RNA classes , read distributions , and RNA features in PBs .

( C ) 5’UTR length poorly correlates with mRNA enrichment in PBs with a light increase during HS . ( D ) 3’UTR length slightly correlated with mRNA enrichment in PBs , especially during HS . ( E ) The half - life of mRNAs is reduced slightly in NS . ( F ) Methyl - 5 - cytosine ( m 5 C ) does not correlate with mRNA enrichment in PBs , although correlating with RNA transport in plants . ( G ) RNA length slightly increased during HS . ( H ) Μethyl - 6 - adenosine ( m 6 A ) modification of transcripts correlates with mRNA enrichments in PBs during HS . 59 Figure S6 . ECTs - depletion increase the number and size of PBs ( A ) Left : confocal images showing immunolocalization of PAT1 ( antiPAT1 ) in trm3trm4 ( TON1 , cytoskeleton ) and arpc5 ( SCAR / WAVE complex ) mutant backgrounds in root meristematic epidermal cells . As a negative control , the pat1 mutant background was used . Note that in trm3trm4 and arpc5 PBs number and intensity were significantly reduced . Scale bars , 5 μm . Right : box plots quantifying PBs in the four indicated backgrounds . Data are means±SD and the significance was determined by the Wilcoxon test . The signal observed in pat1 mutant could derive from the non - specific recognition caused by anti - PAT1 polyclonal antibody ( N = 2 biological replicates , n = 40 cells ) . ( B ) Transient CRISPR in leaf mesophyll protoplasts expressing p35S : DCP1 - GFP using ECT4 / 6 / 8 guide RNA construct . Right : column plot indicating PBs puncta per cell . Data are means±SD ( N = 2 biologi cal replicates , n = 20 cells ) . 60 Figure S7 . PLDs content of identified proteins by the APEAL ( A ) PLDs composition of proteins enriched in DCP1 ( enrichment criterion , log 2 FC > 1 . 5 ) or enriched in GFP ( enrichment criterion , log 2 FC < - 1 . 5 ; noise control ) , in AP or PDL steps . Note that PLDs has significant enrichment of PLD in HS conditions , suggesting that PBs proteome remodeling is driven by PLDs and thus , most likely , weak intermolecular interactions . ( B ) Regression analyses of normalized PLDs length ( PLD aa / total aa per protein ) for five different species . Note that human shows a very strong correlation of normalized PLDs length for the identified homologs , suggesting a tighter assembly of PBs . R 2 values are depicted on the right . aa , amino acid residues . 61 Figure S8 . Cluster analyses of hits from the APEAL approach The subcluster analyses of APEAL reveal three interconnected networks . Left : identified components of subcluster 1 involved in RNA metabolism . The cartoon depicts an mRNA and the corresponding processing components at the 5’ / 3’ - UTRs or m 6 A ( methyl - 6 - adenosine ) readers ( Evolutionarily Conserved C - Terminal Region ) with the YTH cage . Heat maps depict selected proteins from the three subnetworks . Noteworthy , the AP step in the “purple” heatmap did not lead to the identification of RNA metabolism proteins . 62 Figure S9 . DCP1 Associates with plasma membrane lipids and confined at the cell vertex by the cytoskeleton ( A ) Confocal micrographs showing plasma membrane association of DCP1 , RH12 , PAT1 , DCP2 , and DCP5 . Scale bars , 5 μm . Right : box plot showing the plasma membrane ( PM ) to cytoplasmic signal ratio . Data are means±SD ( N = 3 biological replicates , n = 30 cells ) and the significance test is Kruskal - Wallis . ( B ) Confocal micrographs showing the lack of brefeldin A ( BFA ; 50 μm concentration for 1 h ) effects on DCP1 . Scale bars , 10 μm . 63 ( C ) Confocal micrographs showing PAO ( phenyl arsine oxide ; a PI - 4 - OH - kinase inhibitor ) significant effect on DCP1 localization , which was closer to the QC while PAO had little effect on cell edge localization . Confocal microscopy , scale bars , 20 μm . Colour coding shows the signal ratio between the plasma membrane / cytoplasm along the root axis . Note the retention of the DCP1 signal at the plasma membrane after 90 min of PAO treatment ( 50 μ m ) . ( D ) Confocal micrographs showing detection of DCP1 using an anti - DCP1 antibody in root meristematic epidermal cells of WT or plants expressing p35S : GFP - DCP1 ( positive control ) . Note the reduced plasma membrane signal in pi5k1 / 2 mutant root cells , while the vertex localization persists , suggesting potential independence of the two localization pathways for DCP1 . The inset shows detail for the vertex localization of DCP1 and the yellow arrow the gap between two vertices of adjacent cells . Scale bars , 10 μm . ( E ) Upper : confocal micrographs showing SOK3 - YFP and PAT1 ( anti - PAT1 ) lack of colocalization at cell edges . Scale bars , 10 μm . Lower : signal intensity plot confirming the lack of colocalization between SOK3 - YFP / PAT1 at cell vertices or edges . ( F ) Confocal micrographs showing that CHX did not yield to the release of DCP1 - GFP from the plasma membrane or vertices ( quantification on the right ) . Scale bars , 20 μm . Data are means±SD ( n = 33 cells with corresponding calculated points ) and the significance test is Wilcoxon . Lower : box plots showing PBs per cell , and DCP1 intensity on the plasma membrane or the PBs . Data are means±SD ( N = 2 biological replicates , n = 20 cells with corresponding calculated points ) and the significance test is Wilcoxon . ( G ) Confocal micrographs showing detection of GFP - DCP1 localization ( lines expressing p35S : GFP - DCP1 ) in the corresponding root meristematic cells treated with the indicated drugs ( for 60 min ; 1 μ m LB , 10 μ M APM ; 10 μ M CytoD ; 10 μ M Taxol and 50 μ g / ml MβCD ) . Scale bars , 10 μm . ( H ) Confocal micrographs showing that mScarlet - DCP1 ( under the meristem specific RPS5a promoter ) vertex localization is not significantly reduced by the lack of Wave - Actin - Related Protein ( ARP2 / 3 ) complex . Yet , the signal is more spread towards the plasma membrane , suggesting that the Arp2 / 3 complex is required for DCP1 confinement at the cell vertex . Arp2 / 3 is an actin filament - nucleating machine that binds to the sides of existing actin filaments and nucleates new filaments . Here , the arpc5 mutant ( also known as CROOKED ) was used . Scale bars , 10 μm . 64 Figure S10 . Protein purification of hexahistidine tagged DCP1 and RBP1 Upper : protein expression and purification pipeline . Lower : coomasie brillant blue staining of hexahistidine DCP1 / RBP1 ( recombinant 6xhis - DCP1 / RBP1 ) . 65 Figure S11 . DCP1 pleckstrin homology domain associates with liposomes ( A ) Structure of DCP1 PH domain of Arabidopsis . The ribbon model was prepared by Phyre 2 . The superimposition model was prepared atop VASP homology 1 domain ( template : c2lydA , confidence score 100 % and ID % 38 ) , using as aligned templates d1qc6a , d1evha , c1q67B , c2qkmG , d1q67a , and c4b6hA . Bottom : IDR content of DCP1 . Upper right : In vitro phase separation of recombinant 6xhis - DCP1 at three different temperatures for 1 h ( 22 , 4 , and 37 o C ) . Insets denote highly contrasted details . Note the dissolution of droplets at 4 o C . Lower right : a model of phase separation and solid - state transition . In the mixed phase , the protein ( green ) is mixed with the bulk solvent phase . In LLPS , the protein undergoes droplet formation which in many cases forms a shell and a more stable core . Usually , the shell can exchange molecules with the bulk phase . In SL ( solid - state ) , the material properties of the condensed phase change , and very little to no protein is exchanged with the bulk phase . The shape of the condensate can be less circular or even amorphous . Furthermore , the SL condensate can show increased viscosity but reduced elasticity , known also as “elastic ripening” . Biomolecular condensates that arise from liquid - liquid phase separation are often likened to oil droplets in water because of the coexistence of two liquid phases without a membrane boundary . However , oil droplets and biomolecular condensates represent two extremes in the realm of liquid properties . The surface tension of oil droplets is ~ 1000 times higher , whereas their viscosity is ~ 1000 times lower , compared with biomolecular condensates . Gradual increases in the viscosities of biomolecular condensates are often linked to the formation of fibrils that underlie aging - associated diseases . The most widely used measure of viscosity relies on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) . With regards to the representation of amino acids in the DCP1 sequence ( color - coded amino acid representation ribbon ) , previous studies identified arginine and tyrosine as stickers in FUS and other FET family proteins . 66 ( B ) DCP1 phylogeny and amino acid residues conservation , showing the conservation of the PH region in DCP1 . ( C ) Binding of recombinant 6xhis - DCP1 on SUVs . As a negative control , At5g53330 was used due to similar expression levels and properties . The cartoon on the left shows the strategy used in the co - sedimentation liposome assay . 67 Figure S12 . Clathrin - dependent recruitment of DCP1 at the plasma membrane ( A ) INTAM > > HUB1 effect on DCP1 - GFP ( pDCP1 : DCP1 - GFP ) positive foci ( PBs ) and signal intensity ( right ) . Yellow arrowheads denote vertices . Data are means±SD ( N = 2 biological replicates , n = 13 and 52 ) and the significance was determined by a Welch’s ( left ) or paired t - test ( right ) . ( B ) Confocal micrograph showing the dependence of DCP1 ( anti - DCP1 ) localization from clathrin . Lower : relative intensity of DCP1 , at the plasma membrane or the edge ( WT versus chc1 - 3 ) . Data are means±SD ( N = 2 biological replicates , n = 175 and 27 ) and the significance was determined by a Welch’s ( left ) or paired t - test ( right ) . 68 Figure S13 . Liquid - liquid phase separation properties of DCP1 in vitro ( A ) In vitro LLPS of maleimide labeled 6xhis - DCP1 at different concentrations ad temperatures ( variance 4 - 37 o C ) . Ct , critical concentration for LLPS of DCP1 at various temperatures . The concentrations used were : 2 , 10 , 25 , 30 , and 50 μ M . Note that at 4 o C , we observed occasional aggregation of the protein > 30 μ M ( see also File S11 ) . Dense : grey color indicates the conversion to solid states . Above the Ct or the “percolation threshold concentration” , the formation of a critical number of intermolecular cross - links leads to the emergence of networks that transcend single molecules and lead to condensate formation . ( B ) Effect of 1 , 6 - hexanediol ( 1 , 6 - HD ) on LLPS of DCP1 . Susceptibility to disruption by the aliphatic 1 , 6 - hexanediol has often been used to differentiate solid and liquid - like condensates . Scale bars , ~ 200 nm ( approximate value due to the resolution limit of confocal microscopy ) . ( C ) FRAP in a condensate of DCP1 labeled with maleimide ( 25 μ M ) . Scale bar , 350 nm . ROI , region of interest . ( D ) Condensation of hexahistidine - tagged DCP1 to less circular condensates ( 50 μ M ) . ( E ) FRAP in a condensate of DCP1 labeled with maleimide ( 50 μ M ) , showing no recovery . Red rectangular denotes ROI and the arrowhead denotes a condensate that was not bleached ( note the absence of signal loss ) . Scale bar , 1 μ m . ( F ) RBP1 IDR and amino acid residues distribution . With regards to the representation of amino acids residues in the RBP1 sequence ( color - coded amino acid representation ribbon , single - letter amino acids residues ) , previous studies identified arginine and tyrosine as stickers in FUS and other FET family proteins . 69 Figure S14 . Sensitivity to PAO treatment in DCP1 variants . Confocal micrographs showing root meristematic epidermal region cells ( MZ according to the root model in Fig . 5A ) from pDCP1 : DCP1 - GFP ( WT ) or the corresponding phospho - variants of DCP1 . Roots were counterstained with FM4 - 64 ( 5 min , 4 o C ) . PAO treatment was done for 10 min at RT . Scale bars , 20 μm . 1 .
