A growing body of literature describes population - level SARS - CoV - 2 exposure , but studies of antibody seroprevalence within school systems are critically lacking , hampering evidence - based discussions on school reopenings . The Lake Central School Corporation ( LCSC ) , a public school system in suburban Indiana , USA , assessed SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in its staff and identified correlations between seropositivity and subjective histories and demographics . This study is a cross - sec - tional , population - based analysis of the seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 in LCSC staff mea - sured in July 2020 . We tested for seroprevalence with the Abbott Alinity ™ SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibody test . The primary outcome was the total seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 , and second - ary outcomes included trends of antibody presence in relation to baseline attributes . 753 partic - ipants representative of the staff at large were enrolled . 22 participants ( 2 . 9 % , 95 % CI : 1 . 8 % - 4 . 4 % ) tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies . Correcting for test performance parameters , the seroprevalence is estimated at 1 . 7 % ( 90 % Credible Interval : 0 . 27 % - 3 . 3 % ) . Multivariable logistic regression including mask wearing , travel history , symptom history , and contact history revealed a 48 - fold increase in the odds of seropositivity if an individual previously tested posi - tive for COVID - 19 ( OR : 48 , 95 % CI : 4 – 600 ) . Amongst individuals with no previous positive test , exposure to a person diagnosed with COVID - 19 increased the odds of seropositivity by 7 - fold ( OR : 7 . 2 , 95 % CI : 2 . 6 – 19 ) . Assuming the presence of antibodies is associated with immunity against SARS - CoV - 2 infection , these results demonstrate a broad lack of herd immunity amongst the school corporation’s staff irrespective of employment role or location . Protective measures like contact tracing , face coverings , and social distancing are therefore vital to main - taining the safety of both students and staff as the school year progresses .

Introduction Over 3 million people around the world have lost their lives from severe acute respiratory syn - drome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 , or COVID - 19 ) as of May 2021 . The United States alone has reported over 580 , 000 deaths [ 1 ] . A critical bottleneck in containing the virus is under - standing its transmission dynamics . Although much effort has been expended on population - level seroprevalence surveys , scant data exist to understand COVID - 19’s potential effect on the US public school system’s students and staff . Existing data are sobering : ten days into its reopening , an Israeli high school experienced a major outbreak [ 2 ] . Work on the pediatric transmission of COVID - 19 are conflicting ; in multiple studies conducted in Southwest Ger - many , Ireland , and Northern France , children under 10 were found to have had little effect on the spread of the virus , while a study in Chile claimed that elementary students were more likely to contract the virus relative to secondary students [ 3 – 6 ] . Here , we determine the sero - prevalence of COVID - 19 in the Lake Central School Corporation ( LCSC ) , a public school sys - tem located in suburban Indiana , US . The LCSC consists of 1 high school ( grades 9 – 12 ; 3 , 261 students ) , 3 middle schools ( grades 5 – 8 ; 2 , 859 students ) , and 6 elementary schools ( grades kin - dergarten - 4 , 3 , 467 students ) , and transitioned to fully virtual instruction on March 16 th 2020 [ 7 ] . Although there is enormous heterogeneity within the US public school system , LCSC staff’s demographics are broadly representative of national statistics . The LCSC has 16 . 6 stu - dents per teacher , similar to the United States average of 16 students per teacher [ 8 , 9 ] . The median age of public school employees in the United States is 41 , while the median age of the Lake Central employee population lies at 48 [ 10 , 11 ] . Notably , previous reports have estab - lished that advanced age is highly associated with COVID - 19 hospitalization , further under - scoring the threat of morbidity and mortality within this community relative to other school districts [ 12 ] . Given the lack of specificity of COVID - 19 symptoms and that mild and asymp - tomatic cases of COVID - 19 may go undocumented , antibody - based seroprevalance studies are required to estimate population - level exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 , although it should be noted that immunity to SARS - CoV - 2 via such antibodies has yet to be firmly established [ 13 ] . Materials and methods Study design and participants This cross - sectional , population - based analysis of the seroprevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG enrolled participants over a five day period in July of 2020 as part of the LCSC staff’s annual wellness check . Individuals were eligible to participate if they were 18 years of age or older and were employees of the Lake Central school corporation during the 2018 – 2019 or 2019 – 2020 school years . After approval from the Community Healthcare System Central Institutional Review Board ( CHS CIRB # 07 – 02 ) , participants were contacted through their respective LCSC email account as well as by voice message from the LCSC superintendent informing them of the opportunity to participate . These communications provided information regarding the study and a link in the email allowed participants to schedule their testing date . A second email containing a video promoting the study was sent to staff and shared on LCSC social media accounts . There was no cost to participate in testing . Once registered , each participant completed a data ques - tionnaire containing questions about sociodemographic characteristics including self - identi - fied gender , employment factors , and activities that can increase the risk of having COVID - 19 , as well as informed written consent ( S1 Text ) . During the five days of data collection , the study team was present at the testing site to assist with distributing additional consent forms and data questionnaires .

Competinginterests : One authorwas a full - time employeeof Novartis Institutesfor Biomedical Research ( NIBR ) during the preparationof this work ( JohnP . Santa Maria Jr . ) . NIBR had norole in study design , data collectionand analysis , decision to publish , or preparationofthe manuscript . This does notalter our adherenceto PLOS ONE policies on sharing dataand materials . to wear a mask upon entering the building and hand sanitizer was available at each station . Sta - tions were six feet apart , and a member of the LCSC staff used cleaning wipes to disinfect each station between participants . An independent third party vendor , Franciscan WorkingWell , performed venipuncture using standard procedure for the antibody tests , and obtained a 5 mL blood sample for the antibody test and a 6 mL blood sample for blood typing . The primary outcome was the total seroprevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibodies within staff . The secondary outcomes were the changes in odds of seropositivity associated with baseline demographics and COVID - 19 related factors including mask use , a self - reported history of contact with a known COVID - 19 positive person or persons , and a previous positive COVID - 19 test ( PCR or antibody - based ) . Laboratory analysis Seroprevalence was determined utilizing the commercially available Abbott Alinity ™ SARS - - CoV - 2 IgG antibody test , with a reported 100 % sensitivity ( 34 / 34 , 95 % CI : 89 . 7 % - 100 % ) and 99 % specificity ( 99 / 100 , 95 % CI : 94 . 5 % - 100 % ) in detecting anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibodies [ 14 ] . This test provides a binary , present / not present result . Statistical analysis Seroprevalence among LCSC staff was calculated as the proportion of staff members who received a positive antibody test out of the total staff tested . Confidence intervals were first esti - mated by generating a binomial confidence interval with the statsmodel package in Python v3 . 7 . The seroprevalence was then corrected for uncertainties in the test sensitivity and speci - ficity using previously established statistical approaches [ 15 ] . Relative risks ( risk ratios ) were calculated to identify associations between seropositivity and gender , BMI , blood type , contact history , symptom history , travel history , role in school corporation , school where employed , extracurricular role ( coach , club sponsor ) , mask history , previous positive COVID - 19 test , and age on 7 / 20 / 20 , the last day of sample collection . Employment role was separated into two groups : those departments that worked in the school during the Indiana stay - at - home order ( maintenance , technology , and administration ) and those that did not ( all others ) . Continuous variables ( BMI , age ) were binarized by segmenting the variable by its median value . Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple testing on the univariate analyses . To determine if having a history of mask - wearing reduced seropositivity , we constructed a causal diagram based on existing literature and first - hand knowledge of the Lake Central school system and a priori identified gender , age , travel history ( as a proxy for risk taking behavior ) , school type , and role at LCSC as potential confounders to control for in the multivariable logistic regres - sion ( S1 Fig ) [ 6 , 16 – 19 ] . Finally , backward - stepwise feature elimination was used to identify the features most predictive of seropositivity in a multivariable logistic regression starting with the thirteen categories queried in the survey ( threshold p - value of 0 . 05 ) . After the model was identified for which all factors were statistically significant , three factors ( mask history , travel history , and symptom history ) which are understood based on external studies to have an impact on infectivity were reintroduced to this reduced model [ 14 – 16 ] . One factor , having a previous positive COVID - 19 test in four individuals , was overwhelm - ingly predictive for seropositivity . The regression was then re - fitted on the vast majority of individuals without a previous positive test to estimate associations of features with seroposi - tivity within this group . For continuous variables such as age and BMI , missing data were either removed ( univariate analyses ) or replaced with the median of existing data for that vari - able ( multivariable analysis ) . Missing data for categorical variables were either removed ( uni - variate analyses ) or replaced with the mode of that variable ( multivariable analysis ) .

Logistic regressions were calcu - lated using the scikit - learn Python package . Results and discussion Of the eligible 1261 staff members , 753 ( 60 % ) participated in the study . The LCSC staff com - prises 1060 ( 84 % ) women ; the participation group had 635 ( 85 % ) women ; age demographics for the study population compared to that of the total staff were similarly representative ( Table 1 ) . 22 individuals tested positive for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibodies , representing 2 . 9 % sero - prevalence ( 95 % CI : 1 . 8 % - 4 . 4 % ) . After correcting for the reported sensitivity and specificity of the IgG antibody test , the seroprevalence is estimated as 1 . 7 % ( 90 % Credible Interval : 0 . 27 % - 3 . 3 % ) [ 20 ] . In the univariate analyses , having a previous positive COVID - 19 test ( RR 29 . 5 , 95 % CI : 14 . 3 – 60 . 4 , p < 0 . 0001 ) or contact with a COVID - 19 case ( RR 6 . 86 , 95 % CI : 3 . 04 – 15 . 5 ) , p < 0 . 0001 ) were found to be statistically significantly associated with seropositivity , after Bon - ferroni correction ( Table 2 ) . No causal relationship between self - reported mask - wearing history and seropositivity could be identified , after controlling for six confounders available in our data set , identified using a causal diagram ( S1 Table ) ( RR 0 . 63 , 95 % CI 0 . 16 – 4 . 3 ) . This result was maintained when miss - ing data were replaced , rather than excluded ( S2 Table ) . In the multivariable model employing backward - stepwise feature elimination , a previous positive COVID - 19 test ( OR 48 95 % CI 3 . 9 – 600 , p = 0 . 003 ) or contact with a COVID - 19 case ( OR 5 . 6 , 95 % CI 2 . 1 – 15 . 1 , p = 0 . 001 ) were found to be the most predictive factors for seropositivity ( S3 Table ) ; similar results were observed when missing data were replaced , rather than excluded ( S4 Table ) . To interrogate the specific interaction between contact history and seropositivity , the dataset was subsetted to the vast majority of individuals without a previous positive COVID - 19 test and complete data ( n = 727 ) . In this population , a logistic regression analysis including the predictors mask wear - ing , travel history , and symptom history , a positive contact history conferred a 7 - fold increase in the odds of seropositivity ( p < 0 . 0001 ) ( Table 3 ) . The odds increased from 1 : 54 without such a contact to 1 : 7 with contact—or the probability of seropositivity increased from 1 . 8 % to 12 % . Similar results were observed when replacing , rather than excluding , missing data ( S5 Table ) . Table 1 . Characteristics of study population and total staff population .

With a demographically representative 60 % staff participation rate , these data offer an unprecedented view into the seroprevalence of the target population of a Midwest US public school system . The estimated 1 . 7 % seroprevalence of COVID - 19 antibodies among LCSC staff is far below that reported in metropolitan areas throughout the US at the time of testing , underscoring the large and con - tinued risk of COVID - 19 infection within this community upon exposure [ 20 ] . As a point of comparison , Lake County , Indiana , the county within which the LCSC resides , had 4 , 985 reported cases of COVID - 19 , representing 1 . 0 % of the county’s population [ 21 ] . Although the effect of mask wearing on seropositivity , utilizing a causal diagram to identify potential confounders , did not achieve statistical significance , this result should not be inter - preted as a lack of efficacy in the use of masks given the overwhelming quality and quantity of Table 2 .

Both univariate and multivariable analyses demonstrate that a previous positive COVID - 19 test or a history of contact with a COVID - 19 patient were associated with seropositivity . The 7 - fold increase in odds of seropositivity for individuals with a positive contact history is especially noteworthy amongst the vast majority ( n = 727 ) of the individuals without a previous positive COVID - 19 test and complete data . Although these relationships are associational , the combination of low staff seroprevalence and the strong positive association of seropositivity with contact history highlights a high risk group for which the importance of aggressive contact tracing would be efficient and which would minimize the transmission of COVID - 19 , as well as continued pro - tective procedures during school hours such as mask and face shield wearing , and social dis - tancing [ 23 ] . This study has several limitations . Although data were collected from staff employed at 11 different sites ( 10 schools and the transportation facility ) , only the LCSC was involved in the study , limiting the generalizability of this work . Neither ethnicity nor income data were col - lected , precluding analysis of these variables’ previously demonstrated associations with COVID - 19 positivity [ 24 ] . We rely on study participants to self - report variables , excluding anti - body status and blood type , via questionnaire . Some questions may be insufficiently granular , such as the binary mask wearing variable , and participants may also make errors filling out the questionnaire . Insufficient granularity is likely to make groups defined by the variable more similar to each other , while reporting errors are likely to be random and unrelated to the out - come , antibody status . Thereby both will be expected to create bias towards the null , meaning that the results reported in this study are conservative . The low baseline seroprevalence ( 22 posi - tive tests in the 753 - person cohort ) prevents the identification of more subtle , but potentially real , associations among the collected variables and seropositivity . Additionally , the lack of county - level seroprevalence data prevents comparison to the broader population outside of the school district . Given that not all staff elected to participate in the study , some level of volunteer bias is possible . The high participation rate ( 60 . 0 % ) , highly representative sample population ( Table 1 ) and the wide availability of COVID - 19 testing outside of this study , however , all limit the potential for volunteer bias to drive the observed results [ 25 ] . Finally , data was not collected on students in the corporation , preventing the investigation of a potential link between staff or student positivity and transmission within or between these two co - exposed groups . The reopening of US schools poses a potential risk of COVID - 19 transmission to both staff and students . The low pre - opening seroprevalence , in combination with the advanced age of a significant fraction of the LCSC staff , may increase the number and severity of cases should an outbreak occur within this school system , or other school systems sharing its demographic characteristics . Teachers should consider deploying novel teaching strategies that limit the amount of non - distanced interactions . Administrators and legislators should allocate the required resources to implement and maintain robust personal protective measures as recom - mended by the CDC , including contact - tracing , masks , face shields , and social distancing to protect the lives of both the children of the school district and those charged with educating them [ 26 ] .
