The functional impact of Tau / BIN1 interaction as well as the molecular details of this interaction are still not fully resolved . As a consequence , how BIN1 through its interaction with Tau affects AD risk is also still not determined . To progress in this under - standing , interaction of Tau with two BIN1 isoforms was investigated using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy . 1 H , 15 N spectra showed that the C - terminal SH3 domain of BIN1 isoform 1 ( BIN1Iso1 ) is not mobile in solution but locked with the core of the protein . In contrast , the SH3 domain of BIN1 isoform 9 ( BIN1Iso9 ) behaves as an independent mobile domain . This reveals an equilibrium between close and open con - formations for the SH3 domain . Interestingly , a 334 – 376 peptide from the clathrin and AP - 2 - binding domain ( CLAP ) domain of BIN1Iso1 , which contains a SH3 - binding site , is able to compete with BIN1 - SH3 intramolec - ular interaction . For both BIN1 isoforms , the SH3 domain can interact with Tau ( 210 – 240 ) sequence . Tau ( 210 – 240 ) peptide can indeed displace the intramolecular interaction of the BIN1 - SH3 of BIN1Iso1 and form a com - plex with the released domain . The measured K d were in agreement with a stronger afﬁnity of Tau peptide . Both CLAP and Tau peptides occupied the same surface on the BIN1 - SH3 domain , showing that their interaction is mutually exclusive . These results emphasize an additional level of com - plexity in the regulation of the interaction between BIN1 and Tau depen - dent of the BIN1 isoforms . Introduction Genome - wide association studies identiﬁed bridging integrator - 1 ( bin1 ) as a susceptibility gene for Alzhei - mer’s disease ( AD ) [ 1 – 3 ] and meta - analysis showed that bin1 is the second highest genetic risk factor of AD , after the ApoE gene [ 4 ] . There are several isoforms of BIN1 , also called amphiphysin 2 , resulting from alternative splicing , which have speciﬁc tissue distribution , cellular localization and functions . BIN1 protein isoforms 1 – 7 are expressed in the brain , isoform 8 in the muscle and isoform 9 and 10 are ubiquitous . All BIN1 isoforms contain a N - terminal Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) domain that binds to membranes in a dimer conforma - tion and functions in membrane remodelling [ 5 ] ( Fig . 1A ) . The BAR domain composition itself differs between the isoforms due to differential splicing of Abbreviations AD , Alzheimer’s disease ; BAR , Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs domain ; BIN1 , bridging integrator 1 ; CLAP , clathrin and AP - 2 - binding domain ; PRD , proline - rich domain ; SH3 , Src - homology - 3 . 3218 The FEBS Journal 284 ( 2017 ) 3218 – 3229 ª 2017 Federation of European Biochemical Societies exon7 , the neuronal isoforms having an insertion of 31 amino acid residues [ 6 ] . A C - terminal Src - homology - 3 ( SH3 ) domain ( BIN1 - SH3 ) that mediates interactions of BIN1 with several partners such as dynamin , is also found in all BIN1 isoforms . Finally , BIN1 isoforms also have a Myc - binding domain ( MBD ) that binds c - Myc transcription factor and regulates its function [ 7 ] . BIN1 isoforms otherwise differ by their domain com - position . A clathrin and AP - 2 - binding domain ( CLAP domain ) is only present in the brain - speciﬁc BIN1 iso - forms and is involved in endocytosis [ 8 , 9 ] , while a phosphoinositide ( PI ) - binding motif is found in a mus - cle - speciﬁc isoform and ensures localization to mem - brane [ 10 ] . How BIN1 protein contributes to the increased risk to develop AD is currently unknown . BIN1 has been described to directly interact with the Tau protein [ 11 , 12 ] , using NMR spectroscopy with recombinant proteins , in vitro glutathion S - transferase ( GST ) pull - down from HEK293 lysates , polymerase ligation assays in primary neuronal culture [ 12 ] , as well as reciprocal coimmunoprecipitations from wild - type mouse brain homogenates , which conﬁrm interaction at the physiological level [ 11 ] . These data support the hypothesis that BIN1 might modulate the pathophysi - ological process involving Tau , a leading cause of neu - rodegeneration [ 13 – 15 ] . A functional variant modulating BIN1 expression is associated with neu - roﬁbrillary tangles , which are intraneuronal aggregates formed by abnormally phosphorylated Tau proteins [ 11 ] . In addition , in a Drosophila melanogaster model overexpressing Tau , bin1 homologue Amph mediates Tau toxicity [ 11 , 16 ] , and an increase in bin1 expression is observed in AD [ 11 ] . However , this global pattern of expression may differ between the BIN1 isoforms : at the protein level in the brain of AD case , a decrease in BIN1Iso1 ( the largest BIN1 isoform ) was reported , whereas an increase in BIN1Iso9 ( the shortest ) was measured [ 17 ] . In line with Tau , it has been suggested that the BIN1 - Tau complex could be at the interface BARDomain CLAP MBD SH3 MBD SH3 BARDomain 593 1 409 A BIN1Iso1 ( Neuronal ) BIN1Iso9 ( Ubiquitous ) 1 Exon7 PVSLLEKAAPQWCQGKLQAHLVAQTNLLRNQ 1 H ( p . p . m . ) 15 N ( p . p . m . ) 7 . 0 6 . 0 9 . 0 8 . 0 10 . 0 110 115 120 125 130 B 1 H ( p . p . m . ) 15 N ( p . p . m . ) 7 . 0 6 . 0 9 . 0 8 . 0 10 . 0 110 115 120 125 130 C 1 H ( p . p . m . ) 15 N ( p . p . m . ) 7 . 0 6 . 0 9 . 0 8 . 0 10 . 0 110 115 120 125 130 D Fig . 1 .

BIN1 / Tau interaction between the actin and microtubule network and that its deregulation may impact neuronal function [ 12 ] . It has also been proposed that BIN1 may control Tau aggregate entry into the cell through clathrin - depen - dent endocytic inﬂux . This would lead to the propaga - tion of Tau pathology from neuron to neuron after aggregates of Tau permeabilize the endosome mem - brane [ 18 ] . Beyond Tau , since BIN1 has been observed to be mainly expressed in oligodendrocytes , this led to propose that BIN1 may deregulate myelination [ 19 , 20 ] . Finally , BIN1 has been reported to increase cellular BACE1 levels through impaired endosomal trafﬁcking and reduced BACE1 lysosomal degradation , resulting in increased A b production [ 21 ] . In conclusion , since the physiological and pathological roles of BIN1 have to be better dissected , we decided to continue our efforts in order to better understand how BIN1 and Tau interact at the molecular level . We have previ - ously shown direct interaction of the SH3 domain of BIN1 with the proline - rich domain of Tau ( PRD , Tau [ 165 – 245 ] ) [ 12 ] . The interaction motif within Tau PRD was narrowed down to a sequence located between amino acid residues 210 – 240 [ 12 ] . We have addition - ally shown , both in vitro and in primary neuronal cell culture , that Tau phosphorylation affects the interac - tion of Tau with BIN1 [ 12 ] . In this report we went fur - ther and we addressed the isoform - speciﬁc regulation of the interaction of BIN1 with Tau . We chose in this study to compare the BIN1 isoform1 ( BIN1Iso1 ) and BIN1 isoform9 ( BIN1Iso9 ) isoforms ( Fig . 1A ) , repre - senting , respectively , the longest and shortest isoforms , which are the major isoforms present in brain tissues and show differential modiﬁcation of protein level in AD [ 17 ] , suggesting distinct functions . Results BIN1 - SH3 domain is mobile in BIN1 isoform 9 but has a shifted equilibrium towards rigid incorporation in isoform 1 We previously identiﬁed the interaction region of Tau with the isolated SH3 - domain of BIN1 ( BIN1 - SH3 ) [ 12 ] . To further understand how this interaction is reg - ulated , the interaction of the full neuronal ( BIN1Iso1 ) and ubiquitous ( BIN1Iso9 ) BIN1 protein isoforms , both containing BIN1 - SH3 domain at their C termini , were compared . As a ﬁrst step , 1 H – 15 N HSQC 2D spectrum of each isoform , BIN1Iso9 and BIN1Iso1 , were recorded . The large molecular weight of BIN1 ( BIN1Iso9 , 91 . 1 kDa , BIN1Iso1 , 129 kDa homod - imers ) is expected to lead to a long overall rotational correlation time , fast relaxation and severe line broadening in the spectra . However , as it was previ - ously demonstrated with large complexes , it might still be possible to detect sharp NMR signals from the more dynamic parts of these proteins [ 22 – 24 ] . In accordance , 1 H – 15 N HSQC spectrum of BIN1Iso9 dis - plays in the central part of the spectrum signal of low spectral dispersion typical of disordered regions of proteins , which are indeed expected to be dynamic . However , some additional well - dispersed peaks ( Fig . 1B ) , which are characteristic of folded domains , are also present in BIN1Iso9 2D spectrum . These well - dispersed resonances overlaid quite well with those observed in the individual BIN1 - SH3 domain 1 H – 15 N HSQC spectrum ( Fig . 1C ) . This observation indicates that the BIN1 - SH3 domain structure is unchanged and that the domain has signiﬁcant mobility in the context of BIN1Iso9 protein . In contrast , the signals corre - sponding to the isolated BIN1 - SH3 domain are barely detected in the 1 H – 15 N HSQC spectrum of BIN1Iso1 ( Fig . 1D ) , suggesting that the overall tumbling rate of the SH3 domain of BIN1Iso1 has the same order of magnitude as the one of the full BIN1Iso1 . This domain is thus mainly rigidly incorporated , in an equi - librium shifted towards a close conformation , during the NMR acquisition time . BIN1 - SH3 domain is engaged in an intramolecular interaction in BIN1Iso1 Interactions of amphiphysin - related proteins are regu - lated by complex mechanisms , not yet fully under - stood . Previous reports showed in amphiphysin - related proteins that intramolecular interaction of a C - terminal SH3 domain is able to modulate interactions with membranes and / or molecular partners [ 25 – 30 ] . A pos - sible reason for the reduced mobility of BIN1 - SH3 domain in the context of BIN1Iso1 could be its involvement in such an intramolecular interaction . Comparison of the SH3 domain mobility in BIN1Iso1 and BIN1Iso9 might suggest that the BAR domain is not responsible for the intramolecular interaction of the SH3 domain as both isoforms have a BAR domain and the SH3 domain remains mobile in the BIN1Iso9 . However , there is a small difference between the BIN1Iso9 and BIN1Iso1 BAR corresponding to a 31 - amino acid residue sequence encoded by exon7 , pre - sent only in BIN1Iso1 . SH3 domains are known to mediate protein – protein interactions through the recognition of proline - rich sequence motifs [ 31 – 34 ] . The amino acid sequence corresponding to exon7 does not contain such a motif ( Fig . 1A ) . Firstly , to conﬁrm that there is no possible intramolecular interaction between the BAR domain of BIN1Iso1 and the BIN1 - 3220 The FEBS Journal 284 ( 2017 ) 3218 – 3229 ª 2017 Federation of European Biochemical Societies BIN1 / Tau interaction I . Malki et al . SH3 domain , a 1 H – 15 N HSQC spectrum of BIN1 - SH3 domain was acquired in the presence of an excess of BAR domain ( Fig . 2A ) . No signiﬁcant CSP were observed , conﬁrming that the BAR domain of BIN1I - so1 does not contain an SH3 binding site . Comparison of BIN1Iso1 and BIN1Iso9 domain organization ( Fig . 1A ) also shows the exclusive presence of a CLAP - binding domain in BIN1Iso1 . Additional sequence analysis indicates that the CLAP domain , encoded by exon13 [ 5 ] , contains a class I proline - rich motif between residues 336 and 342 [ 32 ] , a motif previ - ously described to be able to interact with BIN1 - SH3 [ 26 ] .

Malki et al . BIN1 / Tau interaction interaction , a 1 H – 15 N HSQC spectrum of BIN1Iso1 was next acquired in the presence of a CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptide containing this proline - rich motif . Com - parison of the 2D spectra of BIN1Iso1 in the absence or presence of an excess of the CLAP peptide shows that resonances corresponding to the BIN1 - SH3 domain are clearly detected in the latter case , as their relative intensities are stronger ( Compare Fig . 2B and 1D ) . The interaction was further characterized by mapping the binding site in the CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) pep - tide , using chemical shift perturbations . When titrating the unlabelled BIN1 - SH3 domain into 15 N - labelled CLAP peptide , the chemical shift of resonances corre - sponding to residues in the region 335 – 348 , which contains the class I proline - rich motif ( 336 – 342 ) , were affected ( Fig . 2C ) , in agreement with a previous report [ 26 ] . In addition , a colinear chemical shift deviation was observed for resonances affected by the interac - tion of the BIN1 - SH3 domain , either isolated or inte - grated in BIN1Iso1 protein , with the CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptide ( Fig . 2D ) . A colinear chemical shift deviation is expected for resonances in fast exchange between the SH3 - free state and a similar SH3 - bound state , showing that the BIN1 - SH3 domain share the same binding interface for the CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptide as an isolated domain or in BIN1Iso1 . These results indicate that BIN1 - SH3 domain binds to the proline - rich motif of CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptide and that this interaction is able to displace a compet - ing intramolecular interaction , which is responsible for the immobilization of the BIN1 - SH3 domain of BIN1Iso1 . BIN1 - SH3 domain within both BIN1Iso1 and BIN1Iso9 interacts with Tau Proline - rich domain Having shown that the BIN1 - SH3 domain is engaged in an intramolecular interaction in BIN1Iso1 , but not in BIN1Iso9 , the molecular characterization of the interac - tion of BIN1 with Tau was pursued by verifying the capacity of Tau PRD to interact with BIN1 - SH3 , in the context of full BIN1 proteins . Signals from the BIN1 - SH3 domain in the context of BIN1Iso9 are readily observable . Addition of Tau PRD to 15 N - BIN1Iso9 lead to chemical shift perturbations of the signals corre - sponding to BIN1 - SH3 , in the same manner as for the isolated domain ( Fig . 3A , B ) . In the case of BIN1Iso1 , BIN1 - SH3 domain is engaged in an intramolecular interaction , its corresponding resonances have weak intensities and are barely detected in the 2D spectrum ( Fig . 1D ) . A 1 H – 5 N HSQC spectrum of 15 N - BIN1Iso1 was acquired in the presence of an excess of Tau ( 210 – 240 ) peptide . NMR signals corresponding to the bound BIN1 - SH3 domain appeared in the presence of the Tau peptide ( Fig . 3C ) , showing that the Tau ( 210 – 240 ) pep - tide was able to shift the equilibrium from a close to an open conformation of the BIN1Iso1 protein . 1 H ( p . p . m . ) 15 N ( p . p . m . ) 7 . 0 6 . 0 9 . 0 8 . 0 10 . 0 110 115 120 125 130 A 1 H ( p . p . m . ) 15 N ( p . p . m . ) 7 . 0 6 . 0 9 . 0 8 . 0 10 . 0 110 115 120 125 130 C 1 H ( p . p . m . ) 15 N ( p . p . m . ) 7 . 0 6 . 0 9 . 0 8 . 0 10 . 0 110 115 120 125 130 B Fig . 3 .

Malki et al . Tau ( 210 – 240 ) and CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptides compete for BIN1 - SH3 binding To better understand the equilibrium between the intra - and intermolecular interactions of BIN1 - SH3 domain of BIN1Iso1 , the dissociation constants K d characterizing the interactions of Tau ( 210 – 240 ) and CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptides with BIN1 - SH3 were mea - sured ( Fig . 4 ) . 15 N - labelled BIN1 - SH3 domain was titrated with Tau ( 210 – 240 ) or CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptides and the titration was monitored using 1 H – 15 N HSQC NMR experiments . The presence of each peptide caused gradual chemical shift perturbations of BIN1 - SH3 domain resonances , typical of a fast exchange rate on the NMR time scale between the bound and free forms of BIN1 - SH3 , allowing to determine K d . The K d , obtained by ﬁtting the chemical shift pertur - bation data using a one - site - binding model , is 15 (cid:1) 0 . 4 l M for Tau ( 210 – 240 ) peptide ( Fig . 4A ) . In agreement with this result , isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) experiments revealed a similar K d of 12 l M , compatible with a one - site interaction ( Fig . 4B ) . This binding is mostly driven by enthalpic interaction ( Δ H = (cid:3) 7 . 5 kcal (cid:4) mol (cid:3) 1 ) , with a net loss in entropy upon binding ( T Δ S = (cid:3) 0 . 9 kcal (cid:4) mol (cid:3) 1 ) . The K d value obtained by NMR for the CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptide was 200 (cid:1) 15 l M ( Fig . 4A ) . ITC experiments to measure binding afﬁnities to CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) pep - tide did not allow ﬁtting of the binding isotherm , as saturation could not be reached ( Fig . 4C ) . These data conﬁrm the lower afﬁnity of the CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) pep - tide compared to Tau ( 210 – 240 ) peptide . To evaluate the capacity of Tau ( 210 – 240 ) peptide to compete with CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptide for BIN1 - SH3 binding , an excess of Tau ( 210 – 240 ) peptide ( 1 : 8 molar ratio ) was added to 15 N - BIN1 - SH3 / CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) complex ( 1 : 8 molar ratio ) and the resulting equilibrium was probed with a 1 H – 15 N HSQC NMR experiment . The resulting spectrum matched the one of BIN1 - SH3 / Tau ( 210 – 240 ) complex ( Fig . 4D ) , indicating that at an equimolar concentration , Tau ( 210 – 240 ) peptide dis - placed the CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptide from its SH3 - bind - ing interface . Tau ( 210 – 240 ) and CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptides share the same interaction surface on BIN1 - SH3 To verify whether the CLAP peptide and the Tau PRD peptide shared the same binding site on BIN1 - SH3 domain surface , chemical shift perturbation data were used . The proﬁle of perturbations reported along BIN1 - SH3 domain is similar with both peptides ( Fig . 5A ) . The extent of perturbations is smaller with the CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptide at comparable stoichiome - try , which might be due to its lower afﬁnity . Reporting the chemical shift perturbations resulting from the addition of Tau ( 210 – 240 ) peptide and CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptides on the surface of the NMR structure of BIN1 - SH3 [ 26 ] allowed to visualize the binding regions ( Fig . 5B ) . Addition of the peptides affected mainly res - onances corresponding to residues located in the canonical SH3 - binding site , which is formed by the RT loop , the N - Src loop , and b - strands 4 and 5 ( Fig . 5A ) . Reporting these data on the SH3 domain surface highlighted a pocket previously described to accommodate proline - rich motifs , corresponding to the xP - binding pocket , which interacts with the PxxP motif , and the speciﬁcity zone , which binds sequences immediately N - or C - terminal to the PxxP motif of the ligand [ 34 , 35 ] ( Fig . 5B ) . In conclusion , Tau ( 210 – 240 ) and CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptides shared a binding surface on BIN1 - SH3 domain that corresponds to the proline - rich binding site of SH3 domains , and their binding is mutually exclusive . Discussion The interaction of BIN1 with Tau is potentially involved in the pathophysiological process of AD and studying its regulation is thus important to understand its speciﬁc contribution . We previously described a mechanism by which the interaction of BIN1 with Tau might be regulated in cells , as we observed that this interaction is decreased by speciﬁc Tau phosphoryla - tions [ 12 ] . In this report , we described another level of complexity susceptible to control the BIN – Tau interac - tion which is dependent on the ubiquitous BIN1Iso9 and neuronal BIN1Iso1 isoforms . In the BIN1Iso1 2D spectra , signals from its SH3 domain are weak or not detected , even at the noise level , indicating that this domain does not behave as a small independent mod - ule . This behaviour is speciﬁc for the BIN1Iso1 iso - form as signals of the SH3 of BIN1Iso9 are all detected with good relative intensity in its 2D spec - trum , showing that it is rotating freely in solution , in an open conformation . Autoinhibition of BAR and F - BAR ( Fer - CIP4 homology - BAR ) containing proteins by intramolecular interaction of the BAR domain with a SH3 domain has already been described [ 25 , 29 , 30 ] . This is the case , for example , for the syndapin 1 and its F - BAR domain whose crystal structure shows autoinhibition by its SH3 domain [ 25 ] . The SH3 domain contacts a basic patch on charged concave sur - face of the syndapin 1 BAR domain dimers by its neg - atively charged side ( RT - src loop ) , which is the side of the proline - rich binding groove .

Malki et al . domain of BIN1 ( present in all the BIN1 isoforms ) does not contain the characteristic basic cluster that would allow docking of the SH3 domain by electro - static interaction as observed in syndapin - 1 . Further - more , the BAR domain of BIN1Iso9 , which only differs by a 31 - amino acid sequence encoded by exon7 from the BIN1Iso1 BAR domain ( Fig . 1A ) , does not restrain the mobility of the BIN1Iso9 SH3 domain ( Fig . 1B ) . Finally , the absence of CSP in a 2D spec - trum of 15 N - SH3 domain in the presence of an excess of the BIN1Iso1 BAR domain ( Fig . 2A ) conﬁrms that the BAR domain is not responsible for an intramolec - ular interaction of the SH3 domain in BIN1Iso1 . Another described site of intramolecular interaction of the BIN1 - SH3 domain is the PI motif [ 28 ] , which is , however , absent from both BIN1Iso1 and BIN1Iso9 sequences . However , in line with the isoform - speciﬁc behaviour of the BIN1 - SH3 domain , the CLAP domain containing an SH3 - binding site , is only present in BIN1Iso1 ( Fig . 1A ) . We showed that a CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptide , containing this SH3 - binding site , can dis - place the intramolecular interaction of BIN1 - SH3 domain in BIN1Iso1 . All together , we concluded that the C - terminal SH3 domain of BIN1Iso1 is involved in an equilibrium between an open and close conforma - tion , the equilibrium being shifted towards the close conformation due mainly to intramolecular interaction with its CLAP domain . We next investigated how the BIN1 isoforms inter - act with Tau . The interaction of BIN1 - SH3 domain with Tau is the same as indicated by identical chemical shift perturbations in respective spectra whatever the type of constructs used ( a full BIN1Iso9 isoform pro - tein or an isolated SH3 domain , Fig . 3A , B ) . This indi - cates that the binding surface of the domain ( Fig . 5 ) is the same for the free BIN1 - SH3 than for the linked Bin1 - SH3 + Tau ( 210 – 240 ) 0 . 0 p . p . m .

Malki et al . BIN1 / Tau interaction one . For BIN1Iso1 , the addition of Tau ( 210 – 240 ) pep - tide lead to the appearance of the bound SH3 signals in the spectrum , showing that in the presence of Tau , the intramolecular interaction was displaced and the equilibrium shifted towards an open state of BIN1Iso1 ( Fig . 3C ) . In addition , reproducing the competition with an isolated SH3 domain shows that the Tau pep - tide can replace the CLAP peptide in the binding pocket of the SH3 domain by simple equilibrium shift . Deﬁnition of the K d are in accordance since the afﬁn - ity of the BIN1 - SH3 domain for the Tau peptide is higher than for the CLAP peptide . Of note , although afﬁnity is lower for the CLAP peptide , it is important to keep in mind that this afﬁnity could be underesti - mated . Indeed , it might be higher in the context of the full protein if considering that the two domains are attached together . Nevertheless , we observed that in this context , Tau is still able to displace the intramolecular interaction ( Fig . 3C ) in the same condi - tions that showed that Tau peptide can take the place of the CLAP peptide bound to the isolated BIN1 - SH3 domain ( Fig . 4D ) . Mapping of the interaction site of both Tau and CLAP peptides additionally shows that the same proline - rich binding pocket is occupied on BIN1 - SH3 surface . The binding of the CLAP or Tau peptides are thus mutually exclusive . Based on our data , the modulation of Tau / BIN1Iso1 interaction by the intramolecular immobilization of its SH3 domain showed that binding to Tau requires an equilibrium shift towards the intermolecular interaction . The intramolecular interaction thus provides a way to modulate the BIN1 / Tau interaction and the availabil - ity of the CLAP domain to recruit its partners . The equilibrium shift might require a ﬁne tuning of the available partners at a speciﬁc location in the neurons , restricting the interaction . In addition , speciﬁc phos - phorylations of the Tau protein would consequently indirectly regulates CLAP domain interaction , by decreasing its capacity to interact with the BIN1 - SH3 domain and thus decreasing the availability of the CLAP due to the intramolecular interaction . Knowing that Tau phosphorylation and localization are abnor - mal in AD , this ﬁnely regulated network of BIN1Iso1 interactions could in turn be affected . Even if other mechanisms are under discussion to explain the impact of the different BIN1 isoforms on the AD pathophysi - ological processes , for example , Tau pathology propa - gation modulated through BIN1 - dependent endocytosis [ 18 ] , our study by revealing mechanistic insight of the Tau / Bin1 interaction dependent on speci - ﬁc BIN1 isoforms will contribute to a better under - standing of their potential distinct roles in AD pathology . Of note , this would be of particular relevance since it was suggested a differential expres - sion of these isoforms in the AD brain [ 17 ] . Material and methods Proteins and peptides BIN1 isoform 1 ( BIN1Iso1 ) , BIN1 isoform 9 ( BIN1Iso9 ) , BIN1Iso1 BAR domain ( amino acid residues 1 – 300 of BIN1Iso1 ) , and BIN1SH3 domain ( Amino acid residues 513 – 593 of BIN1Iso1 ) cDNA sequences were cloned into the pET - 15b expression vector ( Novagen , Merck , Darm - stadt , Germany ) between Nde I and Xho I restriction sites . cDNAs were synthetized with optimized codon composition for expression in bacteria ( Genecust , Ellange , Luxembourg ) . The obtained expression vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 cells . Cells were grown at 37 ° C to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0 . 8 and induced with 1 m M IPTG for 3 h . These highly expressed proteins were puriﬁed using a nickel afﬁnity chromatography column . For the BIN1 - SH3 domain , the protein was incubated with throm - bin protease at 22 ° C overnight , and then the cleaved pro - tein was puriﬁed by a Superdex 75 size exclusion column using 50 m M sodium phosphate pH 7 . 3 , 30 m M NaCl , 3 m M DTT as running buffer . BIN1Iso1 and BIN1Iso9 were loaded onto a Superdex 200 size exclusion column for fur - ther puriﬁcation in 50 m M sodium phosphate pH 7 . 3 buffer , 30 m M NaCl and 3 m M DTT . All the puriﬁcation steps were performed at 4 ° C in the presence of complete protease inhi - bitor cocktail ( Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) . Uniformly labelled 15 N and 13 C or 15 N protein samples were produced in M9 medium containing 0 . 1 % 15 NH 4 Cl and 0 . 2 % 13 C - glu - cose or glucose , depending of the labelling scheme . The PRD of Tau , Tau ( 165 – 245 ) , was expressed in E . coli using pET15b vector without any Tag . Puriﬁcation included a ﬁrst step of heating at 75 ° C for 15 min fol - lowed by cation exchange chromatography in sodium phos - phate buffer pH6 . 5 ( Hitrap SP sepharose FF , 5 mL ; GE Healthcare , Little Chalfont , UK ) . Tau ( 165 – 245 ) was ﬁnally buffer exchanged against ammonium bicarbonate ( Hiload 16 / 60 desalting column ; GE Healthcare ) for lyophilization . CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) and Tau ( 210 – 240 ) peptides were synthe - sized via solid - phase synthesis ( Genecust , Ellange , Luxem - bourg ) . After resin cleavage , peptides were puriﬁed by reverse - phase HPLC . The purity of the synthesized peptides were > 95 % . The molecular weight of each peptide was conﬁrmed by mass spectrometry . CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) and Tau ( 210 – 240 ) peptide sequences are QLK R GP P VP P PPKHT PSKEVKQEQILSLFEDTFVPEISVTTPS and SRTPSL P TP P T R EPKKVAVV R TP P KS P SSAK , respectively , with SH3 recognition motifs underlined and the consensus resi - dues in bold . cDNA encoding CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptide was cloned into the pETNKI - HisSUMO3 - LIC - Kan vector following a liga - tion - independent cloning procedure [ 36 ] .

His 6 - SUMO CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) protein was puriﬁed using a nickel afﬁnity chromatography column and then incubated with SENP2 protease in the presence of 2 m M DTT at 4 ° C overnight . The protein sample was buffer exchanged using a PD - 10 column ( G25 resin , cutoff of 7 kDa ; GE Health - care ) against 50 m M sodium phosphate pH 7 . 3 , 30 m M NaCl , 3 m M DTT , and then loaded on a nickel afﬁnity chromatography column . The cleaved peptide was then recovered in the ﬂow - through . NMR spectroscopy The NMR experiments were recorded at 20 ° C on Bruker 600 - MHz ( NMR assignment ) or 900 - MHz ( titration experi - ments and BIN1 isoforms HSQC spectra ) spectrometers both equipped with a triple - resonance cryogenic probe . NMR measurements were performed in 50 m M sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 3 , 30 m M NaCl , 3 m M DTT , and 10 % D 2 O . BIN1Iso1 , BIN1Iso9 , and BIN1 - SH3 domain 1 H – 15 N HSQC spectra were all recorded at a protein con - centration of 0 . 08 m M . BIN1 - SH3 domain 1 H – 15 N HSQC spectrum was recorded with 3096 points in the direct and 180 points in indirect dimensions for spectral width of 14 ppm and 26 ppm , respectively , and with 48 scans . BIN1Iso1 and BIN1Iso9 1 H – 15 N HSQC spectra were recorded with 3096 points in the direct and 280 points in indirect dimensions for spectral width of 14 ppm and 26 ppm , respectively , and with 256 scans . Spectra were pro - cessed using TOPSPIN software ( Bruker Biospin , Rheinstet - ten , Germany ) and analysed by CcpNmr Analysis [ 37 ] . BIN1 - SH3 domain and CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptide backbone assignments were done using HNCO , CBCA ( CO ) NH and HNCACB triple - resonance experiments . The NMR titra - tion data were obtained by adding aliquots of a 3 m M stock solutions of unlabelled peptides Tau ( 210 – 240 ) or CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) to 0 . 08 m M 15 N - labelled BIN1 - SH3 domain , using HSQC spectra to monitor changes in amide and tryp - tophan indole chemical shifts . The weighted chemical shift changes , Δ d ( 1 H , 15 N ) , were calculated using the following equation : Dd ð H , N Þ ¼ ð Dd 2 H þ Dd 2 N (cid:5) 0 : 159 Þ 1 = 2 . Dissociation constants were obtained by ﬁtting the chemical shift pertur - bation data to the following equation : Dd obs ¼ Dd max a þ b þ K d (cid:3) ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ð a þ b þ K d Þ 2 (cid:3) 4 ab q 2 a 0 @ 1 A where Δ d obs is the average weight of the chemical shifts in the free and bound states and Δ d max is the maximum shift change on saturation . K d is the dissoci - ation constant , a and b are the total peptide and SH3 concentrations respectively . K d calculated based on chemical shift perturbations of seven distinct reso - nances were averaged . In the competition experiments , the Tau ( 210 – 240 ) peptide was added to the preformed BIN1 - SH3 domain - CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) complex yielding a ﬁnal molar ratio of 1 : 8 : 8 and to the BIN1Iso1 at a molar ratio of 1 : 8 . This ratio was chosen as it corre - sponds to near saturation during titration of BIN1 - SH3 domain by both CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) and Tau ( 210 – 240 ) peptides . Isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed at 25 ° C using a MicroCal iTC200 system ( GE healthcare ) . BIN1 - SH3 domain , Tau ( 210 – 240 ) and CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) pep - tide samples were dialysed in 50 m M sodium phosphate buf - fer , pH 7 . 3 , 30 m M NaCl , 3 m M DTT . For Tau ( 210 – 240 ) / CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) - SH3 domain - binding experiments , concen - trations used in ITC measurement were 200 l M BIN1 - SH3 domain in the reaction cell and 3 m M Tau ( 210 – 240 ) or 3 m M CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptide in the injection syringe . A control experiment was performed to measure heats of dilution by titrating Tau ( 210 – 240 ) or CLAP ( 334 – 376 ) peptides into buf - fer solution . The dilution contribution was subtracted from raw titration data . All data were analysed with MICROCAL Origin 7 . 0 using one site curve - ﬁtting model .
