However , the application of PTX is limited due to the significant hydrophobicity and poor pharmacokinetics . We previously reported target - directed liposomes carrying tumor - selective conjugated antibody and encapsulated glycosylated PTX ( gPTX - L ) which successfully overcome the PTX limitation . The tubulin stabilizing activity of gPTX was equivalent to that of PTX while the cytotoxic activity of gPTX was reduced . In human ovarian cancer cell lines , SK - OV - 3 and OVK18 , the concentration at which cell growth was inhibited by 50 % ( IC 50 ) for gPTX range from 15 – 20 nM , which was sensitive enough to address gPTX - L with tumor - selective antibody coupling for ovarian cancer therapy . The cell membrane receptor CD44 is associated with cancer progression and has been recognized as a cancer stem cell marker including ovarian cancer , becoming a suitable candidate to be targeted by gPTX - L therapy . In this study , gPTX - loading liposomes conjugated with anti - CD44 antibody ( gPTX - IL ) were assessed for the efficacy of targeting CD44 - positive ovarian cancer cells . We successfully encapsulated gPTX into liposomes with the loading efficiency ( LE ) more than 80 % in both of gPTX - L and gPTX - IL with a diameter of approximately 100 nm with efficacy of enhanced cytotoxicity in vitro and of convenient treatment in vivo . As the result , gPTX - IL efficiently suppressed tumor growth in vivo . Therefore gPTX - IL could be a promising formulation for effective ovarian cancer therapies . Int . J . Mol .

Introduction Ovarian cancer ranks the eighth cause of cancer death in women worldwide annually estimated to be 151 , 900 out of 238 , 700 new cases [ 1 ] . In the US as one of the typical developed countries , it ranks the fifth cause of lethal tumors among women , accounting for the seriousness in female gynecological cancers [ 2 ] . The standard treatment of progressive ovarian cancer is surgical resections followed by systemic chemotherapy [ 3 , 4 ] . The National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline shows the first line of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer encompasses the administration of carboplatin , paclitaxel ( PTX ) , or the administration of these two . PTX acts as an anti - cancer agent preventing cell division by promoting and stabilizing the assembly of microtubule structures [ 4 – 6 ] . Because PTX is highly hydrophobic , the mixture of Cremophor EL ® and ethanol has been adopted as a solvent for the commercial formulation known as Taxol . However , Cremophor EL ® may induce anaphylactoid and / or anaphylactic reactions in vivo [ 7 ] . Taxol treatment itself is followed by side effects such as hypersensitivity reactions , nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity [ 8 , 9 ] . Therefore , these disadvantages of Taxol treatment should urgently be ameliorated by the development of a proper drug delivery system for PTX . During the past half - century , liposome has been considered one of the most promising drug - carrier systems of PTX due to its versatility , intrinsic biocompatibility and potential variability [ 10 ] . The highly hydrophobic nature of PTX hinder the loading efficiency ( LE ) into the liposome to establish efficient liposomal formulation . Recently , we successfully developed liposomes encapsulating glycosylated paclitaxel ( gPTX ) in the hydrophilic - core [ 11 ] . gPTX is a PTX derivative with a glucose moiety coupled at the 7 - OH radical [ 12 ] , and this modification enhanced the hydrophilicity of PTX allowing practically different solubility in the solvents mixed solvent of Cremophor EL ® , ethanol , and phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) ; in 12 : 12 : 76 ratio ( CEP ) and EG ( 40 % ethylene glycol ) . Exploiting the difference of the solubility we could prepare stable gPTX liposome ( gPTX - L ) with a sufficient amount of encapsulated drug . The outer layer of liposomes can be modified with coupled ligands targeting molecules localized on the cells membrane surface . Active - targeting drug delivery with ligands as nanosystem have been utilized to optimize therapeutic efficacy and minimize systemic toxicity . Ligands for cell surface receptors highly expressed in tumor cell populations have provided a great specificity [ 13 , 14 ] . The cell membrane receptor CD44 could be one of the most promising candidates to be targeted [ 15 – 18 ] . CD44 is a receptor for hyaluronic acid type - 1 transmembrane glycoprotein that is implicated in cell – cell and cell – matrix interactions and is associated with malignancy , particularly with metastasis promotion [ 19 , 20 ] . CD44 has also been considered as a cancer stem cell ( CSC ) marker in several malignancies of hematopoietic and epithelial origin [ 20 ] , and is closely related with tumor progression and drug resistance [ 21 – 23 ] in several tumors including ovarian cancer [ 15 , 16 ] . Collectively , CD44 could be a suitable candidate of target molecule in ovarian cancer to apply drug delivery and minimize side effects . In this study , we improved the preparation of gPTX - L to achieve higher encapsulation efficiency ( EE ) and designed gPTX - IL , gPTX - L bound to anti - human CD44 monoclonal antibody ( anti - hCD44 MAb ) to target CD44 overexpressing ovarian cancer cells evaluating the physical parameters of liposome and the efficacy of gPTX - IL targeting CD44 positive ovarian cancer cells . 2 . Results 2 . 1 . Expression of CD44 in Human Ovarian Cancer Derived Cells First , we assessed the protein and mRNA expression levels of CD44 in the ovarian cancer cell lines SK - OV - 3 , OVCAR - 3 , and OVK18 . Protein expression of CD44 detected by anti - hCD44 MAb , Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1042 3 of 18 was found to be high in SK - OV - 3 cells whereas was barely undetectable in OVCAR - 3 and OVK18 ( Figure 1A , B ) . The anti - hCD44 MAb showed the immunoreactive protein approximately at 85 kDa [ 24 ] ( Figure 1A ) , which is attributed to the predominant isoform of CD44 known as the standard form . The mRNA expression of CD44 by reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) shown in Figure 1C confirm the result of CD44 protein expression in the same manner . Since the overexpression of CD44 was only found in SK - OV - 3 cells line , we considered it as representative of CD44 - positive cells . Likewise , the anti - hCD44 MAb was considered as a suitable ligand to target SK - OV - 3 cells . Figure 1 . SK - OV - 3 cells are overexpressing CD44 . ( A ) Western blot analysis of human ovary cancer derived cells probed with anti - hCD44 MAb and human beta - actin antibody . ( B ) Relative intensity of the bands of CD44 to beta - actin in Western blot was densitometrically analyzed by ImageJ . ( C ) Relative gene expression levels of CD44 to glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) were analyzed by RT - qPCR . The data presented as the mean ± SD from three independent experiments . The statistical significance in mean values of more than two groups was determined using one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and Dunnet multiple comparison test using CD44 expression of SK - OV - 3 cells as control ; ( * * * * ) p < 0 . 001 . Next , we confirmed the presence of CD44 + within the SK - OV - 3 cells . The SK - OV - 3 cells were characterized by CD44 and CD24 through flow cytometric analysis being compared with OVCAR - 3 and OVK18 cells . The expression two antigens CD44 and CD24 has recently been used to explain the CSC population in breast cancer and ovarian cancer . The most population of SK - OV - 3 cells exhibited CD44 + , consisting of both CD44 + / CD24 − and CD44 + / CD24 + population while OVK18 cells showed only CD44 − / CD24 − population and OVCAR - 3 cells showed most CD44 - / CD24 + population ( Figure 2 ) . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1042 4 of 18 Figure 2 . SK - OV - 3 cells contain CD44 + / CD24 − population as well as CD44 + / CD24 + population . SK - OV - 3 , OVCAR - 3 , and OVK18 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry by staining for CD44 and CD24 . The margins of CD24 and CD44 for each cell line were set up by non - stained cells as the negative control shown at the bottom of each analysis . Most of the population in SK - OV - 3 cells were found CD44 positive . 2 . 2 . Sensitivity of Human Ovarian Cancer - Derived Cells to Glycosylated Paclitaxel ( gPTX ) We assessed the anticancer effect of gPTX toward SK - OV - 3 cells as CD44 positive cells and OVK18 cells as CD44 negative cells . In our previous report , gPTX was 3 - fold weaker than PTX in breast cancer derived cells [ 11 ] . This observation was also consistent in ovarian cancer cells ( Figure 3A , B ) . The reduced cytotoxicity should be caused by the increased of hydrophilicity of gPTX hindering penetration efficiency into the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane . However , the IC 50 value of gPTX toward both cell lines is in the range of 15 – 20 nM , which means the cells are sensitive enough to give feasibility of using gPTX for ovarian cancer treatment . Moreover , encapsulation of gPTX into liposomes , which should confer gPTX with penetrability into the cytoplasm , and the specific ligand grafted on the liposome surface could help enhance the targeting potential minimizing systemic toxicity .

( B ) IC 50 value of gPTX and PTX detemined by graph ( A ) . The data presented as the mean ± SD from three independent experiment . 2 . 3 . Potential Uptake of Liposome Conjugated with Anti - hCD44 MAb To assess the potential uptake of the liposomes conjugated to the anti - hCD44 MAb , we first prepared encapsulated 6 - carboxyflourescent ( FAM ) into liposomes ( FAM - L ) , which was conjugated with anti - hCD44 MAb ( FAM - IL ) . The targeting potential of FAM - IL toward CD44 overexpressing cells , SK - OV - 3 cells , was further assessed by confocal microscopic observation and flow cytometric analysis . The green fluorescence intensity of FAM between FAM - L and FAM - IL was equivalent and the green fluorescence observed in the cytoplasmic area was correlated with the intracellular uptake levels of liposome . After 2 h incubation at 37 °C of FAM - L and FAM - IL in the culture of SK - OV - 3 cells , the uptake of FAM was evaluated under confocal microscopy ( Figure 4A ) . Strong green fluorescent intensity of FAM was observed in SK - OV - 3 cells when exposed to FAM - IL . According to the validation by flow cytometric analysis , SK - OV - 3 cells incorporated FAM - IL in 1 h and kept up to 3 h ( Figure 4B ) . In contrast , FAM - L did not show FAM fluorescence in OVK18 cells ( Figure 4 C , D ) , which showed no expression of CD44 . These results imply that immunoliposomes targeting CD44 could effectively enhance the cellular uptake as compared with non - targeted liposomes . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1042 6 of 18 Figure 4 . Immunoliposome enhanced cellular uptake in CD44 postive cells .

Preparation and Characterization of gPTX - L and gPTX - IL Preparation of liposomes encapsulating gPTX ( gPTX - L ) and those conjugated with anti - hCD44 MAb ( gPTX - IL ) followed the method previously described [ 11 ] except for the down - sizing procedure of liposomes . gPTX - L was prepared using remote loading encapsulation . Briefly , in the first step liposomes containing CEP were prepared by rehydrating lipid film with CEP , which consisted of cremophor , ethanol and PBS at the ratio of 12 : 12 : 76 . Due to the high ratio of PBS , the hydrophobicity of CEP is not significant and we reported the similar ratio was sufficiently effective to encapsulate gPTX into liposomes , likewise CEP in our formula of liposome did not impair the stability of liposomes for 4 weeks after encapsulation of gPTX [ 11 ] . Finally , the liposomes encapsulated with gPTX were prepared by a remote loading method to facilitate efficient encapsulation of gPTX into the inner aqueous core of liposomes . This method is exploiting the difference of solubility of gPTX in the two solvents , 40 % ethylene glycol ( EG ) and CEP . The gradient between the two solvents makes gPTX penetrate into liposomes efficiently because CEP increased the solubility of gPTX when compared to 40 % EG . This remote loading process has previously been described as a driving force for active encapsulation of gPTX [ 11 ] . The down - sizing liposome process employed freeze - thawing process followed by extrusion through 100 nm polycarbonate membrane filter in place of sonication with a probe . We also modified gPTX - IL preparation by adding L - cysteine to block excess uncoupled maleimide [ 25 , 26 ] . This blockade was effective at stabilizing gPTX - IL preventing drugs from leakage . We could successfully prepare both gPTX - IL and gPTX - L as nanoparticles with homogeneous diameters of approximately 100 nm with polydispersity indexes less than 0 . 3 , with negative zeta potential , and an improved encapsulation efficiency of gPTX inside with / without anti - hCD44 MAb ( 70 – 90 % ) . The characters for the liposomes encapsulating gPTX in this study are summarized in Table 1 . Table 1 . Characters of the liposomes encapsulating gPTX . Int . J . Mol .

Both gPTX - L and gPTX - IL were observed under transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) ( Figure 5 ) . The images consistently indicated the diameter of gPTX - IL and gPTX - L at around 100 nm as measured by dynamic light scattering and the shape of each particle was spherical with a fairly smooth surface . Figure 5 . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) images of liposome encapsulating gPTX . gPTX - IL showed unilamellar vesicles with diameter of approximately 100 nm similarly to gPTX - L . Each scale bar shows 100 nm . 2 . 5 . Cytotoxicity of gPTX , gPTX - L , gPTX - IL In Vitro First , we assessed IC 50 s of gPTX as naked gPTX , gPTX - L , and gPTX - IL on SK - OV - 3 and OVK18 cells comparing the two different exposure time 24 h ( Figure 6A ) and 72 h ( Figure 6B ) . We found the exposure for 72 h of the three different formulations in vitro was too long to evaluate the IC 50 s since liposomes would fuse with cellular membrane independent of the antibodies of immunoliposomes when exposure time was long enough . In this context , gPTX - IL feasibly showed the IC 50 of 19 nM in SK - OV - 3 cells while naked gPTX and gPTX - L showed IC 50 s ranging from 20 to 22 nM , which were found in small differences to one another . To demonstrate the CD44 dependency of the immunoliposomes reducing the effect of the membrane fusion of liposomes , we thought that the drug exposure time should be shorter than 72 h . Antibody - oriented targeting of gPTX - IL successfully observed to be accumulated on the surface of SK - OV - 3 cells due to the affinity of the antibodies in 24 h exhibiting the lowest IC 50 of 23 . 4 nM while the IC 50 s of gPTX - L and naked gPTX were ranging between 30 and 50 nM . These results suggest that gPTX - IL should target CD44 - expressing cells more efficiently than gPTX - L . Meanwhile , in both cells , naked gPTX and gPTX - L were still cytotoxicic even though they do not have targeting ability . As for the cytotoxicity of naked gPTX , the molecule is possibly internalized into the cell via passive diffusion due to its poor hydrophilicity . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1042 8 of 18 Figure 6 . gPTX - IL exhibited the lowest inhibition concentration ( IC 50 ) in SK - OV - 3 cells .

The data presented as the mean ± SD ( n = 3 ) . The statistical significance in mean values of more than two groups was determined using one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and Dunnet multiple comparison test using IC 50 value of gPTX - IL treatment as control , ( * ) p < 0 . 05 ; ( * * ) p < 0 . 01 ; ( * * * ) p < 0 . 005 ; ( * * * * ) p < 0 . 001 ; ( NSD ) no significant difference . 2 . 6 . Suppression of Tumor Growth In Vivo The suppression of tumor growth by gPTX - IL was evaluated in BALB / c nude mice bearing tumors of transplanted SK - OV - 3 cells ( Figure 7 ) . Figure 7 . gPTX - IL suppressed tumor growth in the most effective manner in vivo . gPTX - IL ( open circle ) , gPTX - L ( open triangle ) , naked gPTX ( open square ) , CEP - IL ( immunoliposome of CEP solvent ) ( closed circle ) , Cremophor EL® , ethanol , and phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) ( CEP , closed square ) , Int .

( A ) The effect of different formulations of gPTX on the volume of tumors . ( B ) Relative tumor volume at day 30 . gPTX - IL was the most effective formulation to suppress the growth of tumor . The statistical significance in mean values of more than two groups was determined using one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and Dunnet multiple comparison test using relative tumor volume of gPTX - IL treatment as a control , ( * ) p < 0 . 05 ; ( * * ) p < 0 . 01 ; ( * * * * ) p < 0 . 001 . ( C ) The tumors from the experiment ( A ) representing each group were displayed exhibiting the effect of each formulation of gPTX . Data are expressed as the mean with ± SD where n = 4 . Naked gPTX , gPTX - L , and gPTX - IL were injected intravenously ( i . v . ) 6 times at the dose of 50 mg / kg of gPTX with 4 - day intervals ( Figures 7 and 8 ) . We administered PBS , CEP , and CEP - IL ( immunoliposome of CEP solvent ) as control . PBS used to suspend liposome was injected in equivalence to the maximum volume of injected liposome as the background . CEP as the solvent of naked gPTX was injected in equivalence to the gPTX volume . CEP - IL as the representation of immunoliposome conjugated to anti - hCD44 MAb , which encapsulates CEP alone , was injected based on the amount of lipid equivalent to that contained in gPTX - IL at dose 50 mg / kg . The tumor growth was observed for 30 days and the relative tumor volume was measured at every 3 - days , then being normalized to the initial tumor volume at day 0 . In our previous report , gPTX - IL conjugated to anti - HER2 MAb , was administered at 150 mg / kg as single dose injection in nude mice bearing HT - 29 tumors and targeted with gPTX , it injected for 3 times in the 10 days interval [ 11 ] . This was an experiment to investigate the maximum tolerated dose to demonstrate effective high dose administration was possible . In contrast , we evaluated the effect of repeated i . v . injection of gPTX equivalent to 50 mg / kg in this study . All tumors from mice treated with five different formulations were excised at day 30 and were compared by tumor size and volume ( Figure 7A – C ) . Loss of body weight was not observed for any of the formulations ( Figure 8A , B ) . Moreover , pathological observations of liver , kidney , and spleen showed that gPTX - IL did not cause significant damage to the tissues during the experiment while naked drug and non - targeting liposome appeared to damage the tissues ( Figure 8C ) . In gPTX treatment , liver showed a cytoplasmic vacuolation . Simultaneously , the kidney exhibited atrophied glomeruli and necrotic areas . In addition , spleen had enlargement of lymphoid follicles of white pulp . In gPTX - L treatment , elongated trabeculus were found in the spleen . Meanwhile , no damage was found in any of those tissues in gPTX - IL treatment . Of note , the tumor growth appeared completely suppressed solely by the administration of gPTX - IL . As a result , gPTX - IL showed excellent anti - tumor activity with fewer side effects . Int . J . Mol .

Discussion In this study , we designed a drug - delivery system targeting ovarian cancer overexpressing CD44 . CD44 is known as common CSC marker and considered critically related with the migration and adhesion of CSCs and during the formation of tumor tissue [ 20 ] . CSCs are thought to be resistant to chemotherapy and responsible for metastasis and recurrence . CD44 positive epithelial ovarian cancer stem cells were also found to be correlated with drug resistance and recurrence [ 22 , 27 ] . Therefore , we consider that the drug delivery targeting CD44 in ovarian cancer could lead to successful results in suppressing specifically CSC population in the tumor site . The screening of three ovarian cancer derived cell lines showed SK - OV - 3 cells overexpressing CD44 while CD44 expression in OVCAR - 3 and OVK18 cells was less or deficient ( Figure 1 ) . Consequently , SK - OV - 3 cells were selected as the target of the drug delivery . Double staining of CD44 and CD24 , which are both correlated with CSC markers , exhibited two different populations of CD44 + / CD24 − and CD44 + / CD24 + Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1042 11 of 18 within SK - OV - 3 cells , and only CD44 − / CD24 + in OVCAR - 3 cells and CD44 − / CD24 − in OVK18 cells ( Figure 2 ) . The phenotype of CD44 + / CD24 − in ovarian cancer cells has been reported to exhibit CSC - like properties of enhanced differentiation , invasion , and resistance to chemotherapy [ 28 , 29 ] , while CD44 + / CD24 + / Epcam + exhibited stem cell characteristics in other reports [ 30 ] . Therefore , SK - OV - 3 cells display a phenotype which should be a suitable candidate for the purpose to design drug delivery targeting CSC - like population in ovarian cancers . In the present study , we successfully improve the encapsulation efficiency of both gPTX - L and gPTX - IL up to approximately 70 % – 90 % ( Table 1 ) by replacing the process of down - sizing liposome from sonication to extrusion . The liposomes diameter of approximately 100 nm of gPTX - L and gPTX - IL could be practical for the drug delivery i . v . since particle size between 50 and 200 nm is considered sufficient for the accumulation of the drug in tumor via enhanced permeability and retention effect ( EPR ) [ 31 ] . The design of targeting CD44 is already employed to enhance drug efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity in ovarian cancer [ 32 , 33 ] . In this study , we employed anti - hCD44 MAb to design the liposome to target ovarian cancer . FAM - IL could successfully allow FAM uptake in the CD44 positive ovarian cancer in one hour exposure of FAM - IL ( Figure 4 ) . This result suggests that CD44 - targeted liposomes involve receptor - mediated endocytosis with additional membrane fusion of lipid bilayers , resulting in a higher cellular uptake , as previously described that CD44 upregulation in the cancer cells assisted endocytosis via independent clathrin - coated vesicles , the caveolae or macropinocytosis pathway [ 34 – 36 ] . As a result , gPTX - IL found to exhibit the most efficient target - oriented cytotoxicity in SK - OV - 3 cells when compared to gPTX - L and naked gPTX in 24 - h treatment ( Figure 6 ) . We further evaluated the antitumor effects of gPTX - L and gPTX - IL in vivo with repeated administration at a total dose of 300 mg / kg gPTX . gPTX - IL exhibited the most effective antitumor activity without side effects , which was evaluated by a loss of body weight and H & E staining of liver , kidney , and spleen ( Figure 8 ) . These results are consistent with those previously reported : a liposome conjugated to anti - HER2 antibody efficiently accumulated and internalized into the HER2 positive cells in tumor tissue while non - targeting liposomes were localized in the stroma [ 11 , 37 ] . In this context , gPTX - IL is conceivable superior to gPTX - L in the inhibition of tumor growth due to the retention time in tumor site . We included CEP - IL as additional control in the in vivo experiment to see the role of CD44 antibody intrinsically , as the stated antibody bound to an empty liposome is able to improve the therapeutic efficacy and inhibit tumor growth even without cancer drug [ 38 ] . CEP - IL did not show significant inhibition on tumor growth , although antigen - dependent cellular cytotoxicity should be expected by the phagocytic activation of macrophages targeting the IgG molecule bound to antigens . In summary , gPTX - IL was successfully demonstrated reduction of tumor volume and the therapeutic efficacy against CD44 - overexpressing ovarian cancer cells in vivo . Therefore , gPTX - IL should have a potential as an advantageous strategy of drug delivery targeting cell surface molecules specifically to ovarian cancer cells . 4 . Materials and Methods 4 . 1 .

Cell Culture and Experimental Animal The human ovarian cancer cell lines SK - OV - 3 cells ( HTB - 77 , ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA ) and OVK18 cells ( TKG 0323 , Cell Bank , Tohoku University , Sendai , Japan ) were cultured in DMEM Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1042 12 of 18 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) , containing 100 U / mL penicillin ( Nacalai tesque , Kyoto , Japan ) , and 10 0 μg / mL streptomycin and OVCAR - 3 ( HTB - 161 , ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA ) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % FBS containing 100 U / mL penicillin , and 100 μg / mL streptomycin . Four - week - old female BALB / c nude mice from Charles River ( Kanagawa , Japan ) were bred at 23 °C and fed with sterilized food and water during the experiments . All animal experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the ethics committee ( Animal Care and Use Committee ) of Okayama University under the project identification code IDs OKU - 2016078 ( Date of approval : 1 April 2016 ) . 4 . 3 . Preparation of Anti - hCD44 MAb To produce anti - hCD44 MAb , hybridoma Hermes - 3 cells ( HB - 9480 , ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA ) cells were cultured using a bioreactor , miniPERM ( SARSTEDT , Nümbrecht , Germany ) . Twenty million of the cells were suspended in 50 mL of PFHM - II ( Gibco , Grand Island , NY , USA ) medium and were transferred into production module . The production module was connected to nutrient module containing 350 mL of PFHM - II . The bioreactor was rotated for 10 days at 37 °C in 5 % CO2 . The medium in the production module was then collected and centrifuged at 150 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove the cells . The supernatant was re - centrifuged at 10 , 000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C . The supernatant was then passed through a 0 . 20 µm filter ( Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmBH , Geottingen , Germany ) to completely remove cell debris . Anti - hCD44 MAb was then purified as follows : the supernatant was passed through a 0 . 5 mL of Protein A Sepharose ( GE Healthcare , Uppsala , Sweden ) equilibrated with PBS . After washing the column with PBS , anti - hCD44 MAb was eluted using 0 . 1 M sodium - acetic buffer at pH 2 . 6 . Five hundred µL of each fraction was readily neutralized with 10 µL of 2 M sodium phosphate buffer , pH 8 . 0 . The fraction containing anti - hCD44 MAb was detected by Western blotting using polyclonal anti mouse IgG HRP ( DAKO , Glostrup , Denmark ) and the protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay kit ( Pierce Biotechnology , Rockford , IL , USA ) . Characterization of anti - hCD44 MAb could be find in Figures S1 and S2 . 4 . 4 . Expression of CD44 in Ovarian Cancer Cell Line 4 . 4 . 1 . Western Blotting Proteins following the SDS - PAGE were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membranes ( Merck Millipore , Burlington , MA , USA ) . To detect CD44 epitope , the blot was probed using anti - hCD44 MAb ( 2 mg / mL , 1 : 2000 ) followed by polyclonal anti - mouse IgG HRP ( 1 : 4000 ) ( DAKO , Glostrup , Denmark ) . Quantitative assessment of relative intensity of the blots were analyzed using ImageJ ( https : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / ) . The actin immunoreact to anti - beta actin Rabbit MAb ( 1 : 1000 , 4970S , Cell Signalling Technology , Inc . , Beverly , MA , USA ) was used as a normalization control . 4 . 4 . 2 . RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptional Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT - qPCR ) RNAeasy Mini kit ( QIAGEN , Hilden , Germany ) was used to isolate total RNA from cells and the extracted RNA was treated with DNase I ( Promega , Fitchburg , WI , USA ) . One µg of RNA was reverse transcribed using GoScript™ Reverse Transcription System ( Promega , Fitchburg , WI , USA ) . qPCR assays were done by LightCycler 480 II ( Roche Diagnostics GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) using LightCycler 480 SYBR green I Master Mix ( Roche Diagnostics GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Gene expression level was normalized with glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH mRNA . The primers used for the reverse transcriptional quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT - qPCR ) analysis are listed in Table S1 . 4 . 4 . 3 . Flow Cytometry Analysis Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1042 13 of 18 SK - OV - 3 cells and OVK18 cells were harvested at logarithmic growth phase , followed by being re - suspended in 100 µL PBS , stained with APC ( Allophycocyanin ) - labelled mouse anti - human CD44 MAb ( BD Science Pharmingen , San Diego , CA , USA ) and FITC ( fluorescein isothiocyanate ) - labelled mouse anti - human CD24 MAb ( BD Science Pharmingen , San Diego , CA , USA ) , and analyzed by BD AccuriTM C6 plus flow cytometer ( Becton & Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) . Data of each experiment was analyzed using FlowJo software ( FlowJo LLC , Ashland , OR , USA ) . 4 . 5 . Preparation of Liposome Encapsulating gPTX 4 . 5 . 1 . Preparation of gPTX - L This preparation was conducted with modified of previous method [ 11 ] . Liposomes composed of DPPC and cholesterol ( by ratio 3 : 1 ) with 5 mol % mPEG – DSPE were prepared by the thin - film hydration method . In brief , DPPC and Chol with 5 mol % mPEG – DSPE were dissolved in an organic solvent of chloroform / methanol ( 9 : 1 v / v ) in an egg flask . The flask was connected to a rotary evaporator ( Eyela , Shanghai , China ) , which was maintained at 50 °C under aspirator vacuum . The resulting lipid film was left overnight under vacuum to remove remaining organic solvent . The fully dehydrated lipid film was suspended in CEP ( Chremophor , ethanol , PBS in 12 : 12 : 76 volume ratio ) by vortexing at 60 °C , resulting in the formation of multilamellar vesicles ( MLVs ) . MLVs were frozen and thawed for five cycles . A single freeze - thaw cycle consisted of freezing at − 196 °C liquid nitrogen for 1 min and thawing at 55 °C water bath for 1 min . The liposomes were then extruded 10 times through a single stack of one 100 nm Whatman polycarbonate membrane ( GE Healthcare , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) using the Mini Extruder ( Avanti Polar Lipids , Inc . , Alabaster , AL , USA ) to form small lamellar vesicles ( SLVs ) . The extruder was kept warm at 55 °C on a hot plate prior to extrusion . The outer solvent of the liposomes was replaced CEP with PBS by ultrafiltration with a 100K - membrane filter ( Merck Millipore Ltd . , Billerica , MA , USA ) at 5000 × g for 20 min five times . Then , gPTX ( 1 mg / mL ) in 40 % EG was added into the solution of liposome encapsulating CEP ( CEP - L ) at 60 °C . gPTX - L was then concentrated to the volume before added drug by ultrafiltration . This encapsulation process was conducted three times . Finally , residual gPTX was removed by washing the liposomes with PBS followed by ultrafiltration at 5000 × g for 20 min five times . 4 . 5 . 2 . Preparation of gPTX - IL CEP - L composed of DPPC and Chol ( by ratio 3 : 1 ) with 4 mol % mPEG – DSPE was incubated with 0 . 5 mol % Mal – PEG – DSPE at 50 °C for 10 min to introduce maleimide functional groups into liposome to conjugate antibodies . Then , gPTX was encapsulated using the solubility gradient method described above . To immobilize antibody on the surface of the liposomes , SH groups were introduced into anti - hCD44 MAb by treatment with 2 - iminothiolane ( Sigma – Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) at a molar ratio of 1 : 50 in 25 mM HEPES , pH 8 . 0 containing 140 mM NaCl . The mixture was subsequently incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark . After removing unreacted 2 - iminothiolane gel filtration with a G25 PD - 10 column ( GE Healthcare , Uppsala , Sweden ) , the modified anti - hCD44 MAb was incubated with liposomes containing Mal – PEG – DSPE overnight at 4 °C . To block free maleimide groups , liposomes were then incubated with L - Cystein ( 0 . 5 mM final concentration ) for 15 min at 25 °C . Residual L - Cystein was removed by ultrafiltration with a 100K - membrane filter 5000 × g for 20 min for five times and followed by removing free anti - hCD44 MAb by ultrafiltration with a 300K membrane filter ( Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH , Gottingen , Germany ) at 6000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C . 4 . 6 . Evaluation of Cellular Uptake 4 . 6 . 1 . Preparation of Fluorescent Liposome Lipid composition and hydration step as same as gPTX - L preparation for fluorescent liposome . gPTX replaced by solution of 5 mmol 6 - Carboxyfluorescein ( FAM ) ( Molecular Probes Inc , Eugene , OR , USA ) in PBS . The fully dehydrated lipid film was suspended by the FAM solution in PBS to Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1042 14 of 18 produce FAM - liposome ( FAM - L ) by the direct encapsulation . To prepare FAM Immunoliposome ( FAM - IL ) , Anti - CD44 MAb was conjugated by the same procedure used for conjugation in gPTX - IL . 4 . 6 . 2 . Confocal Microscopic Observation SK - OV - 3 cells and OVK18 cells were seeded on gelatin - coated 18 mm coverslip ( Iwaki , Japan ) in 12 - well plates . The cells were incubated with 1 μM FAM - L and FAM - IL in serum - free medium for 2 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . The cells were washed three times with cold PBS and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS . The coverslips were placed on the slide that already mounted with mounting - solution reagent containing DAPI ( Vector Lab , Burlingame , CA , USA ) then visualized under a confocal microscope ( Fluoview FV - 1000 , Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) . 4 . 6 . 3 . Flow Cytometry Observation SK - OV - 3 cells and OVK18 cells were seeded 1 × 10 5 cells / well at the 12 - well plates . After incubation at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 for 24 h , 1 μM FAM - L and FAM - IL were applied for 1 h and 3 h in serum - free medium . Cells were trypsinized , washed by PBS three times , followed by being re - suspended in 300µl PBS and analyzed by BD Accuri C6 plus flow cytometer ( Becton and Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) . Data of each experiment was analyzed using FlowJo ® software ( FlowJo , LLC , Ashland , OR , USA ) . 4 . 7 . Characterization of Liposome 4 . 7 . 1 . Size Distribution of Particle and Zeta Potential The size and zeta potential of liposomes were determined by dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering using an ELS - 8000 ( Photal Otsuka Electronics , Osaka , Japan ) . 4 . 7 . 2 . Evaluation of Encapsulation Efficiency ( EE ) and Loading Efficiency ( LE ) Encapsulation Efficiency ( EE ) was calculated as the ratio of the amount of gPTX encapsulated into liposomes to the initial amount of the drug . Loading Efficiency ( LE ) was calculated as the molar ratio of the drug encapsulated into liposomes to the total lipid and chol . The amount of encapsulated drug was evaluated by C18 reverse - phase HPLC ( Hitachi Elite LaChrom L - 2400 , Tokyo , Japan ) under an isocratic condition of 60 % ( v / v ) methanol at a flow rate of 1 mL / min . Ten µL of each sample were injected and the drug was detected at 227 nm . 4 . 7 . 3 . Transmission Electron Microscopy ( TEM ) A 400 - mesh copper grid coated with formvar / carbon films was hydrophilically treated . Liposome suspension ( 5 to 10 μ L ) was placed on Parafilm , and the grid was floated on that suspension and left for 15 min . The sample was negatively stained with 2 % uranyl acetate solution for 2 min . liposome on the grid were visualized with 20 , 000 times magnification with an H - 7650 transmission electron microscope ( Hitachi , Tokyo , Japan ) at Central Research Laboratory , Okayama University Medical School . 4 . 8 . Cytotoxicity Assay 4 . 8 . 1 . Drug Sensitivity Evaluation Prior to the evaluation , we tried to optimize the conditions to observe the drug sensitivity . For SK - OV - 3 cells , we compared two conditions after exposure of drugs for 72 h . One is to add MTT directly after the exposure and the other is to add MTT following incubation for 48 h after drug exposure ( Figure S3 ) . Evaluation of IC 50 was not possible when MTT was directly added after 72 h of drug exposure . Extended incubation for 48 h without drug just after the treatment allowed us to evaluate the IC 50 . For OVK18 cells the evaluation was possible to evaluate the IC 50 when MTT was added just after the treatment with drug for 72 h . The extended incubation of further 48 h was not Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1042 15 of 18 adequate for the evaluation of cytotoxic effect on OVK18 cells because the survived cells reached overgrowth , which affected the cell growth . Drug sensitivity was checked by MTT assay after 72 h ( OVK18 ) and 120 h ( SK - OV - 3 ) . Cells were seeded in a 96 - well plate at 5000 cells / well . After incubation at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 for 24 h , different concentrations PTX and gPTX were added to each well . For OVK18 , after incubation for 72 h , 4 . 25 mg / mL MTT solution was added at a final concentration of 0 . 5 mg / mL in each well and the plate was incubated for 4 h . The initially seeded cell number ( 5000 cells / well ) and the drug exposure time ( 72 h ) were fixed in both SK - OV - 3 cells and OVK18 cells ; therefore , the extended of incubation time should not induce any biases . For SK - OV - 3 cells , after incubation for 72 h , the medium with drug was replaced with fresh medium without drug , and incubation were continued until 48 h , 4 . 25 mg / mL MTT solution was added at a final concentration of 0 . 5 mg / mL in each well and the plate was incubated for 4 h . Formed formazan crystals were dissolved with 10 % ( w / v ) SDS in 0 . 02 N HCl and incubated overnight . Finally , the absorbance of each well was measured at 570 nm using an MTP - 800 Lab microplate reader ( Corona Electric , Ibaraki , Japan ) . The experiment was performed in triplicate . IC 50 s were estimated from the survival curve . 4 . 8 . 2 . Evaluation of Cytotoxic Effects of Liposome Formulation by 24 h and 72 h Treatment In vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated by the MTT assay after 72 h ( OVK18 ) and 120 h ( SK - OV - 3 ) of cells were seeded in a 96 - well plate at 5000 cells / well . After incubation at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 for 24 h , different concentrations of gPTX were added to each well . After incubation of drug for 24 h and 72 h , MTT assay was performed as described above . 4 . 9 . Evaluation of Antitumor Effects of Drugs In Vivo The xenograft of SK - OV - 3 cells in mice was prepared by a subcutaneous injection of 7 . 5 × 10 6 cells / mouse . Tumor volume was measured by a Vernier caliper and calculated as [ length × ( width ) 2 ] / 2 . The anti - tumor effect of each formulation was evaluated when the tumor volume reached 50 – 200 mm 3 . Mice were randomly assigned to five groups ( n = 4 ) ; group 1 for PBS , group 2 for CEP , group 3 for CEP - IL , group 4 for naked gPTX , group 5 for gPTX - L and group gPTX - IL ; 50 mg of gPTX - equivalent per kg body weight was injected six times via tail vein at the intervals of 4 days . Tumor volumes and body weights were measured at 3 - or 4 - day intervals . Paraffin - embedded liver , kidney , and spleen sections ( 5 - μm thick ) were stained with Hematoxylin ( Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) and 0 . 5 % Eosin Y ( Wako , Osaka , Japan ) ( HE ) for histological analysis then visualized under a FSX100 Inverted Microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) . 4 . 10 . Statistical Analysis All the experiments were repeated at least three times . Data were depicted as means ± standard deviation . The statistical significance in mean values between two groups was determined by 2 - tailed student’s t - test . The statistical significance between the mean values of more than two groups was determined using one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and Dunnett ’ s multiple comparisons test . p < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . 5 . Conclusions The cytotoxicity of gPTX , a derivative of PTX with a glucose moiety , exhibited the cytotoxicity equivalent of one fifth of the cytotoxicity by PTX against ovarian cancer - derived cells . This cytotoxicity was considered due to the hydrophilicity from the glucose moiety . However , the IC 50 of gPTX toward the cells was found to be still low enough to target ovarian cancer . Down - sizing of liposome by extruder and supplementing cysteine - masking unreacted radicals improved the procedure of immunoliposome preparation to achieve practical encapsulation efficiency for gPTX - L and gPTX - IL . As a result , the preparation of sufficient quantities of both gPTX - L and gPTX - IL became practical . gPTX - IL should quickly recognize the CD44 positive cancer cells and retain on the cell surface due to the antibody , implying that the potential therapeutic effect should be high . As expected , gPTX - Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1042 16 of 18 IL exhibited distinguished inhibition of tumor growth with less apparent side effects in vivo . Targeting CD44 in the ovarian cancer should be attributed to targeting the CSC population , since overexpression of CD44 in SK - OV - 3 could correlate with CSC – like character . Taking these into consideration , the immunoliposomes encapsulating a practical amount of gPTX should be a promising formulation for anticancer drugs as a positive targeting drug delivery system in ovarian cancer .
