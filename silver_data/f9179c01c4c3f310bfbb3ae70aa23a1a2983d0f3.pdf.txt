CYTOCHALASIN INHIBITS THE RATE OF ELONGATION OF ACTIN FILAMENT FRAGMENTS SUSAN S . BROWN and JAMES A . SPUDICH . From the Department of Structural Biology , Sherman Fairchild Center , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , California 94305 ABSTRACT Submicromolar concentrations of cytochalasin inhibit the rate of assembly of highly purified Dictyostelium discoideum actin , using a cytochalasin concentration range in which the final extent of assembly is minimally affected . Cytochalasin D is a more effective inhibitor than cytochalasin B , which is in keeping with the effects that have been reported on cell motility and with binding to a class of high - affinity binding sites from human erythrocyte membranes ( Lin and Lin . 1978 . J . Biol . Chem . 253 : 1415 ; Lin and Lin . 1979 . Proc . Nad . Acad . Sci . U . S . A . 76 : 2345 ) ; 5 x 10 ' M cytochalasin B lowers the rate to 70 % of the control value , whereas 10 - ' M cytochalasin D lowers it to 25 % . Fragments of F - actin were used to increase the rate of assembly fivefold by providing more filament ends on to which monomers could add . Under these conditions , cytochalasin has an even more dramatic effect on the assembly rate ; the concentrations of cytochalasin B and cytochalasin D required for half - maximal inhibition are 2 x 10 - ' M and 10 - 8 M , respectively . The assembly rate is most sensitive to cytochalasin when actin assembly is carried out in the absence ofATP ( with 3 mM ADP present to stabilize the actin ) . In this case , the concentrations of cytochalasin B and cytochalasin D required for half - maximal inhibition are 4 x 10 - 8 M and 1 x 10 ' M , respectively . A Scatchard plot has been obtained using [ 3 H ] cytochalasin B binding to F - actin in the absence of ATP . The Kd from this plot ( - 4 x 10 - 8 M ) agrees well with the concentration of cytochalasin B required for half - maximal inhibition of the rate of assembly under these conditions . The number of cytochalasin binding sites is roughly one per F - actin filament , suggesting that cytochalasin has a specific action on actin filament ends . KEY WORDS (cid:9) cytochalasin (cid:9) - (cid:9) actin assembly The mechanism of action of cytochalasin remains unknown despite its extensive use in studies ofcell shape and motility ( for review , see reference 20 ) . Many of these studies of effects on motility are complicated by the fact that cytochalasin concen - trations in the micromolar to millimolar range were used . There is thus the possibility of nonspe - cific low - affinity binding to many sites , and con - RAPID COMMUNICATIONS J .

If a high affinity effect can be demonstrated , then binding should be restricted to one or a few specific sites , and effects on motility may be interpretable . In fact , many effects on cell shape and motility have been reported at submicromolar cytochalasin . Also en - couraging are the findings ( 2 , 7 , 13 ) that there is a hierarchy of effectiveness of different cytochala - sins on motility - related functions : cytochalasin E 657 ( CE ) > cytochalasin D ( CD ) > cytochalasin B ( CB ) . Any study of the mechanism of action of cytochalasin must satisfy these criteria of high - affinity binding and the hierarchy ofeffectiveness . Previous investigations have revealed high - af - finity binding to a sugar transport site in erythro - cytes ( 10 , 11 ) . However , this binding cannot be linked to the motility - related effects , since among other things it does not show the order of effec - tiveness mentioned above . More recently , high - affinity binding not related to glucose transport has been reported ( 5 , 9 ) . Fur - thermore , Lin and Lin ( 6 ) have partially purified acomplex from erythrocyte membranes that binds cytochalasin with high affinity . This complex con - sists of several proteins , including actin . The bind - ing of cytochalasin to this complex seems quite relevant to motility , since , the affinities of binding of various cytochalasins are in the same order as their relative potency in affecting cell morphology and motility . Furthermore , cytochalasin blocks the ability of this complex to nucleate actin assembly . Here we report high - affinity binding ofcytocha - lasin to highly purified Dictyostelium F - actin , pos - sibly to the filament ends . This binding results in inhibition of the rate of assembly of G - actin into its filamentous state . MATERIALS AND METHODS Actin waspurified from Dictyostelium discoideum by the method of Uyemura et al . ( 21 ) which included Sephadex G - 150 and DEAF chromatography , and ammonium sulfate fractionation . Actin was depolymerized by sonication of an F - actin pellet ( 2 x 15 s , setting 4 , Kontes ultrasonic cell disrupter , Kontes Co . , Vineland , N . J . ) into a buffer containing 3 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM ATPor 3mM ADP , and allowed to incubate on ice for aminimum of 1 h . Polymerization of 0 . 2 mg / ml G - actin wasinitiated at 25 ' C by adding salts to 0 . 1 M KCI and 0 . 1 mM MgClz . Cytochalasin was added just before the addition of salts in a constant volume of dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) so that the final DMSO concentration was0 . 5 % . Con - trol samplescontained 0 . 5 % DMSO without cytochalasin . Prein - cubations ofG - actin with cytochalasin before the addition of salt had no effect on the results . Filament fragments were obtained by sonicating ( 5 s , setting 4 , Kontes ultrasonic cell disrupter ) a sample of F - actin , prepared as described above in the absence of cytochalasin . Sonication caused adecrease in the reduced viscosity ofthe F - actin from I 1 dl / g to - - 2 dl / g . Immediately after sonication , 1 vol of0 . 2 mg / ml fragments was added to 20 vol of 0 . 2 mg / ml G - actin ± cytochalasin , then immediately salts were added to initiate po - lymerization . Actin concentration was determined by absorbance at 290nm ( minus that at 320 nm ) with an extinction coefficient of 0 . 62 cm - ' - ml - mg - 1 ( 4 ) andby the method of Bradford ( 1 ) . Viscometry was performed at 25 ' C in a Cannon - Manning 100 semi - micro viscometer ( Cannon Instrument Co . , State Col - 658 (cid:9) RAPID COMMUNICATIONS lege , Penn . ) ( buffer flow time = 62 s ) to follow the rate of assembly ofactin at 0 . 2 mg / ml . Rate ofassembly was calculated from curvessuch as those shown in Fig . 2A , as follows : Thefinal extent of assembly could be measured when the assembly rate wasreasonably fast ( see Table 1 ) ; however , for very slow assem - bly , it was impractical to measure the final extent of assembly . Therefore , the rate in all cases has been defined as the time required to reach a reducedviscosity of 5 . 5 dl / g ( one - half ofthe final reduced viscosity in the control reaction in the absence of cytochalasin ) . Equilibrium dialysis was performed at 3°C with a Microvol - ume equilibrium dialyzer ( Hoefer Scientific Instruments , San Francisco , Calif . ) with 0 . 25 - ml wells . " Gel backing " ( Dialysis membrane from Biorad Laboratories , Richmond , Calif . ) was boiled in 2 mM EDTA before use . Onewell was filled with 0 . 2 ml of F - actin ( 6 - 9 mg / ml ) in 3 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 3 mM ADP , 0 . 1 M KCI , and0 . 1 mm MgCl2 ; the neigh - boring well was filled with 0 . 2 ml of [ 3 H ] CB ( 4 x 10 - 9 to 1 . 3 x 10 ' M ) in the same buffer . Glass beads were added to the chambers tofacilitate mixingas they rotated . Dialysiswascarried out for 21 - 28 h at 3 ° C ; dialysis for an additional 24 hdid not dramatically change the results . [ 3 H ] CB prepared by the method of Lin , Santi , and Spudich ( 8 ) was obtained from New England Nuclear , Boston , Mass . RESULTS It has long been known ( 15 ) that fragments of F - actin can increase the rate of assembly of actin by providing more filament ends onto which mono - mers can add . It can be seen in Fig . 1 ( compare open vs . filled symbols at zero cytochalasin ) that fragments of F - actin accelerate the rate of assem - bly nearly fivefold under the conditions of the experiment . We found that cytochalasin has a dramatic effect on this fragment - accelerated rate . The concentrations required for half - maximal in - hibition are 2 x 10 - 7 M CB and 10 - s M CD ( Fig . 1 ) . Cytochalasin also inhibits the rate of actin as - sembly under these conditions without fragments added , butto alesser extent ( Fig . 1 , filled symbols ) . However , higher than micromolar concentrations of CB have the opposite effect ; for example , 5 x 10 - 6 M CB increases the assembly rate to 110 % of the control value ( Fig . 1 A , filled circles ) . At these higher concentrations , we also noted a dramatic increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis by F - actin ( Fig . 1 A , squares ) , as previously reported by Low and Dancker ( 12 ) . The most dramatic effect of cytochalasin was observed if actin was assembled in the absence of ATP ( Fig . 2 ) , suggesting that ATP interferes with the cytochalasin inhibition !

These are significantly lower concen - tration ranges than in the presence of ATP ( Table 1 ) . The final extent of assembly under all of these conditions as measured by reduced viscosity was not greatly affected by the submicromolarconcen - conditions which adequately stabilized it . We found that G - actin remained assembly - competent in the absence of ATPfor at least 24 h at 0°C ifthe ATPin the buffer was replaced with 3 mM ADP to saturate the nucleotide binding site ( suggested by Dr . Roger Cooke , Univ . of Calif . , San Francisco ) . As can be seen in Fig . 2A ( squares ) , Dictyostelium actin can be assembled in this buffer to the same high reduced viscosity ( - 10 dl / g ) as has been published for Dictyostelium actin in ATP - con - taining buffers ( 21 ) . The assembly , however , is about an order of magnitude slower than in ATP ( compare Figs . 1 and 2 ) .

It should also be noted that CD was always about an order of magnitude more effective than CB . Thelow concentrations of cytochalasin required to inhibit actin assembly suggested that high - affin - ity binding sites should be present in the actin preparations . Therefore , we measured binding of [ 3H ] CB to high concentrations ( 6 - 9 mg / ml ) of F - actin by equilibrium dialysis . As shown by the curve in Fig . 3 , Scatchard plot analysis revealed a high - affinity component with a Kd of 2 x 10 - 8 M , and 1 binding site / 2 x 10 4 actin monomers ( I / - 60pm of F - actin ) .

The final extent of assembly is measured by reduced viscosity . linear regression analysis of these data yields a Kd of 7 X 10 - s M and 1 binding site / - r20 ltm of F - actin . 660 (cid:9) RAPID COMMUNICATIONS DISCUSSION We report here that submicromolar concentrations of cytochalasin inhibit the rate of assembly of purified actin , under conditions where the final extent of assembly is minimally affected . The ef - fect on assembly satisfies the criteria set up in the Introduction : it is a high affinity effect , seen at very low cytochalasin concentrations , and the proper order of effectiveness , CD > CB , is seen . Furthermore , we have demonstrated a high - affin - ity binding of cytochalasin to purified F - actin which corresponds to and can account for the effects on actin assembly . Our observations are clearly distinct from a variety oflower affinity effects previously reported for purified actin . In fact , at higher cytochalasin concentrations , the opposite effect is seen : cyto - chalasin accelerates the rate ofactin assembly ( see Fig . 1 and reference 12 ) . Other effects seen at higher cytochalasin concentrations include a re - Condition Cylochalasin concentra - tion for half - maximal in - hibition N Reduction in fi - nal extent of as - sembly R with ATP 2 X 10 ' 6 CB with ADP 4 X 10 ' 0 with ATP 2 X l0 - " 20 CD with ADP l X 10 - " ' 11 FIGURE 3 Scatchard plot analysis of the binding of [ ' ' H ] CB to F - actin in ADP , as described in detail in Materials and Methods . The open and filled circles refer to different experiments . duction in the viscosity of F - actin ( 18 ) , an altered morphology of F - actin ( l7 ) , and an elevated in - trinsic ATPase activity ( see Fig . 1 A and reference 12 ) . Low and Dancker ( 12 ) postulate that these cytochalasin effects are due to destabilization of the actin filament and thus give results similar to those obtained with sonication of F - actin . Soni - cation causes fragmentation of F - actin and gen - erates filament ends ; this is at least partially re - sponsible for the increased intrinsic ATPase and can cause increased rates of assembly ( 15 ) , as for instance in our experiments with added filament fragments ( Fig . 1 ) . Since actin appears to assemble by sequential addition of monomers to a growing filament end ( 3 , 16 ) , it is possible that cytochalasin inhibits the rate of assembly by interacting with an end of a filament and interfering with further addition of G - actin monomers . The stoichiometry of high - af - finity binding from the Scatchard plot is - 1 site / 20 to 60 pm of F - actin . Electron microscopy of Dictyostelium F - actin with a reduced viscosity of l l dl / g reveals filaments generally longer than 10 pm ( 21 ) , but precise lengths are difficult to measure . Qualitatively , they are long enough to suggest that there may be on the order of one cytochalasin binding site per filament . Since this stoichiometry represents l binding site / - 10 " mon - omers , it is , of course , possible that a very minor non - actin component in our highly purified actin preparation is the binding species . This minor component would , nonetheless , have to be in - volved in actin assembly , and the simplest hypoth - esis is that an actin filament end is the binding species . Another indication that cytochalasin inhibits the rate of assembly by interacting with filament ends is the observation that fragment - induced as - sembly is even more sensitive to cytochalasin , even though the concentration of Dictyostelium actin in those experiments was the same as in the unin - duced case . Thus , the only variable was the num - ber of filament ends , and possibly the species of nucleotide at the filament end . During assembly the ATP bound to G - actin is hydrolyzed to ADP , which remains tightly bound to F - actin ( 19 ) . Since the hydrolysis step may occur subsequent to the assembly step as monomers add on to the growing filament ( reference 3 ; Pardee and Spudich , unpub - lished observations ) , one might expect to have bound ATP at the assembling end of F - actin . Sonication , on the other hand , would be expected to generate ends having bound ADP . This think - ing is illustrated in the following scheme : P The data presented in this report indicate that ATP interferes with the cytochalasin inhibition , since assembly in the absence of ATP is so much more sensitive to cytochalasin . An interpretation consistent with both this and the filament fragment data is that a filament with ADP bound may be more susceptible to cytochalasin inhibition than an end with ATP bound . Lin and Lin ( 6 ) have isolated a 30S complex from erythrocyte membranes which both binds cytochalasin with high affinity and induces actin assembly that is sensitive to cytochalasin . This complex contains actin , spectrin , and other minor components . Since the experiments reported here show that filament fragments dramatically in - crease the rate of actin assembly in a manner that is quite sensitive to cytochalasin , it is possible that the actin in their complex is in a form somewhat equivalent to the filament fragments . Further studies on the interaction of cytochala - RAPID COMMUNICATIONS (cid:9) 661 sin with purified actin could lead to an under - standing of cell biological effects of cytochalasin in terms of how actin assembly and disassembly might be involved in motile processes . Further - more , insight into the role of nucleotide in regu - lation of assembly may be gained if cytochalasin proves to be a sensitive probe for the species of nucleotide at the actin filament end .
