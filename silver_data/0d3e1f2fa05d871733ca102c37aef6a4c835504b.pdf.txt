Treating clinicians rely on sleep diaries to assess how patients experience sleep . Currently used sleep diaries are made for adults and parents are asked to fill them in for their children . Digital sleep diaries for children could provide more reliable reports and enhance children’s involvement in their treatment . We report on the design of Snoozy , a chatbot - based sleep diary for children eight to twelve . Following an informant - based de - sign approach , we : 1 ) interviewed clinicians and parents 2 ) involved children as co - designers ( N = 8 ) , user - test participants ( N = 17 ) and field - test participants ( N = 5 ) . Earlier works have examined the po - tential of chatbots in non - clinical personal informatics for children . Our study demonstrates how children can report on sleep - related experiences to clinicians , through a chatbot that asks clear and guided questions and communicates with kindness and empathy .

Sleep deprivation and problems with initiating sleep or interrupted sleep affect be - tween 20 - 37 % of children and adolescents [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . Lack of sleep impacts children of different ages in different ways , including long - term behavior issues [ 3 ] , obesity [ 11 ] , hampering cognitive function [ 3 ] or school performance [ 39 ] . Clinical treatment of sleep problems relies on self - report to as - sess and treat a possible sleeping disorder . While there are multiple self - report measures for adults , only few have been developed for children [ 40 ] [ 41 ] . Especially for younger children , it is their par - ents who do most of the reporting . The problem with parental report is that it can be biased by the perception of the parents or by social desirability effects , and therefore it might be unreliable [ 43 ] . Studies that compared nighttime recordings and actigraphy to parental report have shown that parents may describe some symptoms accurately , as well as the sleep and wake time of their children , but may be unaware of the sleep onset latency or night - time awakenings , especially when children grow older [ 8 ] [ 22 ] . Ultimately , the difficulty in capturing and in conveying children’s sleep related experiences to clinicians is a barrier for involving children in healthcare decisions concerning them , a right instituted by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child [ 44 ] . Research in sleep pediatrics emphasizes the importance of self - reportand arguefor developinga self - reportinstrument forchildren to accompany the parental report [ 40 ] , [ 45 ] . Meltzer et al . [ 40 ] found that the self - report by children aged eight to twelve on their sleep patterns , hygiene and disturbance , provides a reliable and valid measurement and additional information to the parental report . Sleep diaries help children record sleep - wake patterns and calculate parameters such as sleep efficiency ( i . e . time asleep divided by time in bed ) , time of awakenings and sleep onset ; and leave room for adding extra notes [ 46 ] . While paper diaries are still used in clinical practice , electronic versions have been developed as ways to facilitate data collection [ 16 ] . The discretionary use of personal 297 IDC ’22 , June 27 – 30 , 2022 , Braga , Portugal Tessa Aarts et al . informatics solutions for family sleep tracking , could potentially help families increase awareness of sleep related - behaviors and improve sleep hygiene [ 19 ] . The design challenges in designing self - tracking technologies for children’s sleep are multifold , such as reducing the effort needed to report on sleep related aspects [ 46 ] , designing feedback that motivates children to supply self - reports [ 47 ] , and even threats to children’s autonomy when personal informatics enable or even encourage parental control [ 17 ] . Chatbots have been used before to diagnose and observe various health disorders [ 1 ] , [ 18 ] and have been found helpful in engaging children [ 48 ] and to have positive effects in them [ 27 ] . These prece - dents motivated us to design an interactive experience sampling chatbot to support self - report in children about their sleep - related experience ( s ) . Specifically , we targeted children aged eight to twelve who can read and write but are not yet old enough to handle reli - ably diaries designed for adults . We aimed to develop a reliable and comprehensive way to capture sleep related information , to be used by clinicians in the treatment and diagnosis of sleeping disorders . This context puts some requirements on the kinds of data to be collected and on sustaining self - report for periods of one or two weeks . We approached this challenge following an informant - based design approach [ 32 ] . Our design process was modelled after the Bluebells’ method [ 20 ] in three stages : 1 ) In the “Before play” stage we interviewed parents and clinical practitioners aiming to identify what information content should best compliment the parental report and how the output of the chatbot could be most useful for clinical purposes . 2 ) In the “During Play” stage children joined co - design sessions held at an after - school childcare center . 3 ) In the “After Play” stage the data thus collected was analyzed to guide the design of the chatbot . Our findings inspired the design of Snoozy , using Landbot , an online platform for building chatbots [ 49 ] . The user experience of the sleep reporting chatbot was evaluated by 17 children in an after - school care center and was field - tested for one week by four children . Our results confirm the potential of chatbots for collecting subjective sleep report from children , while using clear and guided questions and communicating with kindness and empathy . 2 RELATED WORK Kingshott et al . [ 50 ] surveyed medical staff , parents and children regarding questionnaires and diaries used for assessing children’s sleep quality . Among others , they concluded that existing sleep diaries need to be simplified , are confusing to complete , can lead to missing data , but remain necessary for collecting sleep related data since children are reluctant to wear self - tracking devices round the clock . Meltzer et al . [ 40 ] found that 40 % of the parents they surveyed were unaware of their children’s difficulties with sleep onset , night awakenings , or poor sleep quality . They argued that the self - report of children aged eight to twelve regarding their sleep patterns , hy - giene , and disturbances provide more reliable information than parental report as well as information that is otherwise not cap - tured . A systematic literature review by Matricciani [ 51 ] suggest that parental or proxy assessment of sleep quality is most relevant for young children only , who have difficulty in understanding the concept of time . While they do not advise an exact age after which parental report is no longer advisable , they argued that older chil - dren are able to report on their sleep while parents or caregivers may be less tuned - in with their actual sleep time . Gaina et al . [ 13 ] found that subjective sleep indices correlate highly with objective measures ; this suggests that sleep questionnaire can be applied to surveys for sleep habits screening . Sleep diaries for adults are typically used for self - assessment of sleep for periods of one to two weeks . A widely used example is the Consensus Sleep Diary [ 46 ] . Over the years , the contents of such diaries have converged largely to include standard questions regarding the time of going to bed and getting out of bed , how long it takes to fall asleep , the number of hours slept , the number of awakenings , feelings before and after sleep , activities before going to sleep and sleep - influencing behaviors during the day , such as napping and exercising . Graphical diaries presented on tablets or smartphones have been proposed to facilitate the capture of subjective sleep data [ 34 ] , however the content and length of such diaries has not been adapted for children . While children have used sleep diaries in various clinical studies , we could find few earlier examples of sleep diaries specifically designed for children . Sonne et al report on MOBERO [ 33 ] , a smartphone - based system that assists families in establishing healthy morning and bedtime . In a two - week intervention with children with ADHD ( N = 13 ) and their families , using MOBERO was found to improve children’s independence , to reduce parents’ frustration levels and was associ - ated with a 16 . 5 % reduction in core ADHD symptoms and an 8 . 3 % improvement in the child’s sleep habits , both measured by validated and widely used questionnaires . Kay et al [ 19 ] , describe the design , implementation , and initial evaluation of Lullaby a system which combines consumer - grade temperature , light , and motion sensors , audio and photos , and an off - the - shelf sleep sensor , to provide a comprehensive recording of a person’s sleep . Lullaby users can review graphs and recordings of sensor readings relating to their sleep quality and environmental conditions trends and potential causes of sleep disruptions . Lullaby addresses individual users who wish to improve their sleep and provides an interface that allows them to explore their sleep history . To address privacy concerns , Lullaby allows users to suspend the collection or delete sensitive data . An initial trial of Lullaby [ 19 ] for two weeks showed that participants ( N = 4 ) made regular use of Lullaby around sleeping hours but preferred to browse their data at other locations than their bedrooms and at different times of the day . Participants wished to turn off recording during wake hours and occasionally deleted some data for privacy purposes , illustrating how important it can be to provide privacy controls to users . Nevertheless , for the clinical treatment of sleep , self - report is essential and is only complimented rather than replaced by sensor data . Pina et al [ 47 ] developed DreamCatcher and deployed it as a probe to examine tracking sleep with ten families for a duration between 15 and 50 days . DreamCatcher was designed as a shared information display summarizing the latest sleep reports of all family members . Its deployment provided insights into how sleep tracking through wearables and self - report could be integrated in family routines and interactions . Contrary to this application , our 298 Snoozy : A Chatbot - Based Sleep Diary for Children Aged Eight to Twelve IDC ’22 , June 27 – 30 , 2022 , Braga , Portugal clinical focus calls for autonomously and privately self - reporting on sleep without the biases and reactivity effects that are associated with using a shared information display . In designing sleep diaries for children , we need not only to en - sure children understand the diary questions and respond reliably but also their adherence to the reporting schedule , i . e . , completing the diary regularly for the duration of the study . A meta - analysis [ 35 ] of 42 studies of health - related behaviors using diaries and experience sampling with young people ( under 18 ) , argued that compliance rates were high for both clinical ( 76 , 9 % ) and non - clinical ( 79 , 2 % ) applications . However , the studies reviewed covered a wide range of ages ( most were above 12 years of age ) and most of them ( 92 % ) involved a monetary incentive , which is not appropriate for young children and is more relevant for motivating participation in research studies rather than in cases where patients record their symptoms to their treating clinician . Rather , it seems more promis - ing to motivate adherence to diary keeping by providing children with an engaging interactive diary . Self - tracking sleep manually puts substantial burden on users which may lead to low adherence . Choe et al [ 7 ] report on the de - sign and deployment of SleepTight a low - burden , self - monitoring tool that leverages Android’s widgets to reduce the capture bur - den and to improve access to information for the users . A four - week deployment of SleepTight ( N = 22 ) demonstrated that the specific user interface elements improved sleep diary compliance rate by 19 % while improving information access and encouraging self - reflection . Design researchers have argued in favor of storytelling appli - cations and chatbots for collecting subjective report by children . Collaborative storytelling plays an essential role in children’s lives . Listening to and sharing their stories and ideas with others are activities through which children make sense of their world and practice their language skills [ 25 ] . Morning et al . [ 27 ] have cre - ated a digital library called Storyteller , that contains issue - focused short stories provided by a chatbot , which aims at improving the emotional wellbeing in children aged eight to twelve . Due to the lockdown for COVID - 19 , Morning et al were unable to test the psychological effects of their platform , however , their study demon - strates that children were able to use it and that positive outcomes are associated with higher levels of program engagement . Based on these findings , we anticipated that an experience sampling chatbot could potentially enable storytelling for children about their sleep and similarly lead to increased engagement and benefits for the children . 3 INTERVIEW STUDY The first step in our design process aimed at understanding the context in which the diary would be used . We interviewed parents of children with sleeping problems and medical sleep profession - als . The interview study protocol was developed and approved by the internal ethical committee of the Eindhoven University of Technology . 3 . 1 Methods We targeted parents of children under twelve years of age , who suffer from insomnia and medical professionals consulting this target group . We managed to recruit six parents of children with sleeping problems aged one to eight and six with medical profes - sionals ( pediatricians and child psychologists with an average of 9 . 5 years’ experience in child insomnia ) each lasting between 30 to 60 minutes . Both professionals and parents of patients were selected to have prior experience with sleep diaries and thus held opinions on what is useful in current diaries and what is desired from future sleep diaries . Interviews were conducted one - to - one , though in some cases both parents were present . The interviews were semi - structured following a simple script with questions concerning the use of diaries and the interpretation of information thus collected about children’s sleep . Questions to the parents were about who filled the diary , aspects of their experi - ence , e . g . , how well it captured what mattered to them , sources of confusion , annoyance , how frequently the filled it , and to describe how well they could report in the diary information regarding the child’s sleep . To the expert , we asked their opinion regarding the reliability of the information they obtained through the diary , the adherence of parents , the readability of the diary entries written by participants and to describe some of the complex situations they encountered . We asked what conclusions they wished to draw from the diary and how well does it support them in this . Finally , we inquired about the scope of the diary , e . g . , daytime activities , sleep related routines , etc . Except from one interview that was held in [ removed ] language all other sessions were held in English . 3 . 2 Analysis Interviews were selectively transcribed while omitting pauses and hesitations and then subjected to conventional content analysis [ 15 ] allowing for an inductive generation of codes . A first analy - sis by the third author resulted in a list of requirements from the diary that were member checked in a focus group with clinical professionals . Noting how much of the experiential aspects were lost in mapping to requirements making it difficult to inform the interaction design of the diary , we decided to recode the data tak - ing a more phenomenological stance focusing on the experiences rather than the desired functionalities of the diary . The data was segmented to with answers to each question as a unit of analysis and inductively categorized into five categories that emerged in this phase : • Self - Reporting : statements concerning the ability of the child to self - report and how children do so now . • Parental - Reporting : statements concerning the ability of the parents to report about their child’s sleeping problems and how they do so now . • Diary : statements concerning sleep diaries that parents and children use currently , any information they omit , and how the medical specialist use the completed diaries . • Design : information concerning the usability and user expe - rience of the diary and any other artefacts they use next to the diary . • ‘ Interesting’ : Other statements mentioned by parents or med - ical specialists that seemed relevant to the project . After - wards , this category was re - analyzed and divided into emerg - ing sub - themes . 299 IDC ’22 , June 27 – 30 , 2022 , Braga , Portugal Tessa Aarts et al . The authors discussed and revised the definition of the themes , and the first author recorded the transcripts using these revised themes . During this step content analysis [ 15 ] the ‘Diary’ and ‘De - sign’ theme were merged , as they had substantial overlap . The ‘ Interesting’ theme was divided into three sub - themes concerning : ‘ Child involvement’ , ‘ Impact on family’ and ‘ Parent - doctor communi - cation’ . The themes are summarized briefly in the results section below . 3 . 3 Results 3 . 3 . 1 Parental Report . All parents mentioned they understand the importance of filling in the diary and do not forget to do so . Yet , four out of six mentioned they sometimes wonder what the doctor does with it and that it feels like a waste of time . On the other hand , the experts mentioned that parents sometimes need convincing on why it is important to fill in all parts of the diary and need clarifications on which data is used for what . Clinical expert practitioners ( we refer to them as CE1 . . CE6 ) mentioned they are never sure if the data is accurate and that they believe that parents often overes - timate the sleep problems of the child , sometimes projecting on the child’s sleep that they had a bad day or slept badly themselves . Experts commented that parents sometimes disregard questions ( EP6 ) or provide socially desirable answers ( EP1 , 3 , 6 ) . EP1 mentions the parents often perceive their children as awake when they are not . Several experts ( EP1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ) question the motivation of the par - ents to put in the time and effort to fill in the diary accurately and completely . Parent participants ( PP1 . . . PP6 ) were unanimous that they could identify their child’s sleeping problem as well as the behavior that resulted from their child sleeping badly the night before , which could have physical consequences ( e . g . , headaches , restless , cannot walk well ) , but also mental ones ( e . g . , feeling grumpy , stressed , an - gry , moody ) . Their opinions were split between those who claimed that while their report is accurate , they also assume that their chil - dren wake up without them knowing it ( PP3 , 5 ) , and those who claim their parental report is very accurate , since they always wake up when their child wakes up ( PP1 , 2 , 4 , 6 ) . All parents emphasized how the sleeping problems of their child influence their own sleep , emotions , and their stress level . 3 . 3 . 2 Children’s Engagement in Reporting . In their practice all par - ticipating experts let the parents choose if they fill in the sleeping diary themselves or with their child ( ren ) . Four of the six parents in - volve the child in the parental report , discuss the diary and progress with the child and mentioned that they find this important to do . However , the parents also mention they are not sure how to involve their child and what he or she understands . The experts all agree that it would be valuable if children would report on their own sleep , and that child - report can be more ac - curate than parental - report when children do not sleep with the parents anymore and are old / capable enough to complete the sleep diary . Consequently , they encourage parents to involve them ac - tively in the ( parental ) report , although they notice parents still end up doing it independently . These experts , note how children often tell them that they do not always tell their parents when and if they wake up during the night or that they sometimes find it hard to explain how they feel or what has happened . Finally , experts emphasized the child - doctor relationship , which cannot be sacrificed or damaged , so the doctor cannot push the child during clinical sessions to test the veracity of the parental report . 3 . 3 . 3 Data doctors need . In the diary used for parental report , there is an open space for extra notes . Both the parents and the experts find this comment section to be an important way of explaining things and sharing contextual information . However , experts say some parents fill in too much irrelevant information , which takes them too long to read during a clinical consultation . On the other hand , the parents are not sure which things are important to men - tion and lack guidance and structure . Experts suggest relevant information section could be the sleep hygiene and nighttime routine , special events , co - sleeping or in which bed they slept , activities and destinations during the day , beverage intake , screen time , emotions of the child , medication intake , and how the children would rate their sleep . However , they caution that there should be a balance between getting enough information and people still wanting to fill it in as well as ; “putting in more in the diary doesn’t always improve it” ( EP5 ) . 4 CO - DESIGN OF CHATBOT WITH CHILDREN Several design directions were considered at this point . Considering we had previously developed a web - based sleep diary with a graph - ical diary for adults [ 34 ] , that could be ideally presented on a tablet , we considered two main directions as most promising . The first and most immediate at hand option , was to make a children - oriented adaptation of this graphical diary , which had the downside that lots of the presentation and control elements ( charts , ranges , filters ) in - volve concepts unfamiliar to younger children . The second option , which called for a new design , was for a purpose made chatbot that we hoped could be more natural and engaging for children to inter - act with . Both these options were explored , designed , prototyped and tested with children , however here we focus our presentation on the design and initial evaluation of the chatbot - based diary . We decided to focus our design efforts on children eight to twelve , who could be expected to use the diary independently but are not yet able to use the adult version . In order that the chatbot - based sleep diary would fit children’s conversational capabilities and their preferred style of communication we organized a co - design session at a child - care center in the vicinity of the university . We provided three co - design assignments to ensure they were kept them small and informative [ 4 ] aiming to understand their conversational and communicative behavior and inspiration regarding the looks and functionalities of the chatbot . We aimed for a creative and fun as - signment that the children would enjoy , and a play - like atmosphere which can ensure good quality input from children [ 9 ] . We em - phasized hand - on tasks as a concrete way to discuss ideas with children who may experience difficulties in communicating ver - bally [ 10 ] . The study was approved by the ethical review board of the Eindhoven University of Technology . 4 . 1 Methods 4 . 1 . 1 Toolbox . Because interaction with a chatbot is textual , inter - action design amounts to designing the conversation [ 31 ] . Thus , our co - design activities were intended to capture the content and 300 Snoozy : A Chatbot - Based Sleep Diary for Children Aged Eight to Twelve IDC ’22 , June 27 – 30 , 2022 , Braga , Portugal style of discussion the children prefer . Adapting the Bags of Stuff method to this context [ 36 ] , we gave a “Toolbox” to children filled with cut outs of words and emoticons to write stories , as in Amin et al . [ 2 ] . The children were asked to write a story by forming sen - tences with the words and emoticons in the Toolbox ( see Figure 1 ) . Children could choose the subject of the story , enabling them to express themselves freely [ 10 ] . They were given a large piece a paper , hanging on the wall , on which they could stick the words , as physically cutting and pasting has been argued to enable idea gen - eration [ 12 ] . In order to further help children express themselves freely [ 10 ] , we encouraged them to add words of their own choice , as long as they would also use ( some of ) the words / emoticons we provided in the Toolbox . 4 . 1 . 2 Collages . We told children to imagine a situation where they wake up after sleeping bad and think of ‘buddy’ they would want to discuss this with and create a collage of this ‘buddy’ . This could be a fictional person / character , someone from TV or someone they made up themselves or someone who existed , whom they knew or did not know . Visual inquiry methods , such as collage making , have been found useful in conceptualizing ideas [ 6 ] , formulating ideas and help represent them to others [ 30 ] . Additionally , collage making can spark creativity as it allows the user to work in a nonlinear and intuitive way [ 30 ] . The children were given 5 different age - appropriate magazines from which they could cut and paste , but they were also free to draw and color themselves , or combine the two , since drawings offer children more freedom in expressing themselves [ 10 , 12 ] . The children were given a big new piece a paper , hanging on the wall , on which they could stick everything . 4 . 1 . 3 Roleplay . We asked children to roleplay three different sce - narios between them and their ‘buddy’ / friend in which they would talk to about their sleep . The three scenarios varied in conversa - tional and communicative behavior regarding the level of authority of the buddy and its playfulness , e . g . the use of smileys , responding to reactions or sticking to the script and showing encouragement or empathy . The children could choose the one that would fit best with the character ( s ) on the collage they just made . The children were also given an empty scenario template , which they could fill in themselves if they thought the other ones are not appropriate . The children were free to discuss and act out the scenarios to get a better feel of which one they thought suited best . After they chose their scenario , the children were asked what they liked and what they did not like about it . 4 . 1 . 4 Participants . We invited the entire group of children aged attending the after - school childcare facility of Korein at the day of the study , to take part in the co - design session . Eight children took part ( CP1 . . . CP8 ) , two boys and six girls with ages eight to twelve years old ( M = 10 , SD = 1 ) took part in this session . Their parents had been informed two weeks beforehand and had all signed an informed consent form . We explained to children that they were free to take part or leave the session any time they wished . 4 . 1 . 5 Study Setup . The co - design session was held at the facilities of Korein for practical reasons but also because children may feel more comfortable in a familiar environment . It was conducted in October 2020 , before the second wave of the Covid - 19 peaked , and at a time when children were present on location and no social Figure 1 : Materials from the informant design session . distancing rules were imposed upon them in [ country ] . The session lasted 75’ , with each assignment taking about 15’ with explanations in between . We held the session in a separate room with a big table with the crafts equipment in the middle ( Figure 1 ) and big sheets of paper on the wall ( Figure 2 ) . We gave children their own material for the first and third assignments and encouraged them to do them individually without help , in a way they thought was good . During the workshop , one of their regular supervisors was available to answer questions and help them if stuck , as without someone to interact with children they may feel observed and uncomfortable [ 10 ] . This process was aimed at creating a balance between the children not being influenced too much in their work and having a safe , motivational and creative environment [ 4 ] . The data gathered consisted of observation notes and detailed pictures of the assignments . We deliberately avoided using a video camera , as this could lead to children feeling they need to perform [ 10 ] . The different assignments were discussed with the supervisors of the childcare center , to make sure they were fun and enjoyable for the children . The supervisors considered the session as a fun activity that deviates from the normal routine of the children , which is appreciated especially since a lot of the regular activities had been cancelled due to the COVID - 19 pandemic . Furthermore , they appreciated the assignments as creative , practical hands - on activ - ities that would create nice artefacts that the children could take home afterwards . After the first assignment , one of the children informed us that he was not motivated to participate and was allowed to go and play with his friends . His data was excluded from the analysis . 4 . 2 Results The children hesitated in the first assignment which they found too broad and asked for extra reassurance and repeated encouragement as to whether their subject “is this good ? ” and “is this also allowed ? ” ( CP1 , CP3 , CP5 , CP6 ) . They talked either in simple present tense ( CP2 , CP3 , CP5 , CP6 ) or simple past ( CP1 , CP4 , CP7 ) . The supervisor of the group commented how their storytelling was similar to 301 IDC ’22 , June 27 – 30 , 2022 , Braga , Portugal Tessa Aarts et al . Figure 2 : Impression of the co - design session with children working around a large table and hanging the large pieces of paper on the wall vlogging , which is popular among children and where they often describe their day and activities . Overall children could all tell a coherent story about their sleep in the Toolbox assignment using a first - person perspective , while some started a second story ( CP2 , CP3 , CP4 , CP7 ) . More than half of the words they used were their own additions . Six children used the emoticons in their story and applied them within the context . For the second assignment the children put on several elements in the collage , with an average of eight pieces . They all used animals in the second assignment , while CP5 also included celebrities . CP3 , CP5 and CP7 gave the animals names , while CP2 and CP5 used speech balloons to let the animals talk . Children chose for quite diverse animals ranging from exotic and wild - life animals to cats and dogs . The boys gave male names and the girls female names . CP7 changed the scenario character of assignment three to look like a cat in the collage showing preference for an animal character . In the final assignment children used all the scenarios provided . CP6 and CP7 made their own scenario . One child CP3 dislikes chatting every day . Answering to what they liked , five children appreciated the avatar for being nice , kind , and wishing them well . 4 . 3 Snoozy Based on the interviews and the co - design session , we designed Snoozy ; an interactive experience sampling chatbot to support sto - rytelling in children aged eight to twelve about their sleep - related experiences . Snoozy was realized using a chatbot development tool called Landbot [ 49 ] . The chatbot was given an animal character in line with the children’s choices in the co - design session . We opted for a snail avatar which is familiar to most children and feels plausible to meet daily , but is also not a typical pet , to avoid the situation that children would associate the chatbot with their own pet , with which a wider range of discussion topics than sleep might be expected . The chatbot offers a choice among predefined answers which also reduces the need for text entry , which is hard for younger children [ 14 , 53 ] . Ready texts prompt the type of input expected , addressing the concern experts had expressed , namely that children find it hard to explain how they feel or what happened . These ready answers are formulated in simple past and simple present tenses . The conversational behavior was designed to be kind and empathic , e . g . , asking the child how he / she felt , wishing them luck during the day , and answering with regret or excitement on negative or positive responses . Based on the comments by experts , we implemented specific dialogue steps to capture data typically missed in diaries and which clinicians would hope that the open comment sections of diaries would help collect : sleep hygiene , nighttime routine , special things or events , how the child slept or did not sleep , co - sleeping or in which bed they slept , activities and destinations during the day , beverage intake , screen time , emotions of the child , medication intake , and how the children would rate their sleep . The visual presentation of the chatbot features a common chat dialogue interface with speech bubbles aligned left and right for the chatbot and user respectively ( see figure 3 ) . Once the user initiates a dialogue , he or she is presented with questions regarding last night’s sleep and possible events that could have affected it . Snoozy’s questions are written in a friendly but mature manner with respect to the self - reporting capabilities of the child [ 24 ] . The chatbot refers to itself in first person and questions suggest the chatbot as the recipient for answers given by the user e . g . “Do you want to tell me about it ? ” instead of “Do you want to talk about it ? ” . The duration of the entire chatbot conversation depends on the child’s answers of the user . If the child reports having slept poorly , the dialogue with the chatbot will be relatively longer than if they have slept well . On average , the chatbot asks around 25 questions in the former case and 15 in the latter . Each chatbot conversation starts by asking if the child is ready and its first name , which helps personalize questions later on . To clinicians understand the context in which children’s self - report was obtained , the chatbot asks whether the conversation is held privately or with someone else present , after which the child is asked how they slept last night offering six predefined answers ranging from great to awful . If the child reports having slept poorly , Snoozy asks them whether they noticed by waking up during the night or by not being able to fall asleep , and why this is the case e . g . , whether they were worried about something or whether something kept them awake ( Figure 3 ) . After this , the chatbot asks what they had already tried in terms of a solution and whether it helped . The latter helps both the user and the medical expert in tracking treatment progression , and to establish whether suggested behaviors improve or worsen the user’s quality of sleep . Regardless of the sleep quality that the child reports , the chatbot will inquire about contextual influences , e . g . , amount of pre - sleep screen time , food and drink intake and bedtime timestamps to con - textualize the sleeping behavior of the child . The chatbot dialogue concludes with several questions that would occur in natural con - versation , such as what the user is planning to do today or if they want to tell the chatbot about something else that is unrelated to their sleep . The chatbot asks either questions with predefined answers or with a text field attached . Some questions with predefined answers 302 Snoozy : A Chatbot - Based Sleep Diary for Children Aged Eight to Twelve IDC ’22 , June 27 – 30 , 2022 , Braga , Portugal Figure 3 : Dialogue flow following the question why the user did not sleep well . Figure 4 : Offering the choice to elaborate on earlier answers concerning the user’s experiences also have an option to formulate an open answer in case the predefined answers are not found suit - able . Where applicable , the chatbot will present the user with the choice to elaborate on a given answer ( Figure 4 ) . These open fields give the opportunity to children to express their experiences , and encourages the storytelling aspect of self - reporting [ 26 ] . Further - more , the chatbot will react accordingly to answers given by the user before proceeding to the next question , such as thanking them for their elaboration or reassuring that not doing so right now is fine . Where Snoozy presents several lines of dialogue , it will do so with small breaks to not overwhelm the child . The data collected during the conversation can be exported for analysis in standard data processing packages . so that it can be analyzed further . 5 EVALUATION OF THE SLEEP TRACKING CHATBOT 5 . 1 Formative evaluation and iterative improvement of the chatbot We ran an expert review session with a medical professional who had 32 years of experience in the field of child therapy and 15 years of experience in the field of somatically insufficiently explained physical complaints [ 13 ] . She provided feedback on the design of the chatbot particularly regarding the information it solicits , which we implemented in the final version of Snoozy . Based on her feedback , we added questions about Important sleep - influencing attributes such as which bed the child has slept in last night , whether the child sleeps or slept during the daytime and whether the child has stayed home from school due to being too tired . Such information can help them understand symptom origins . The expert found our choice of vocabulary rather childish for children aged eight to twelve . While she agreed with having the chatbot express emotion and empathy , she steered us not to address children with sleep problems as if they are helpless and in a terrible predicament , but to treat them as an equal and solution - oriented conversant . Based on their advice we also made the questions less explanatory , more concise , and with less need for interpretation . Furthermore , we made some questions more open - ended to allow for a more natural conversational flow . 5 . 2 User experience evaluation Before proceeding evaluating Snoozy with children , we ran a us - ability test with twelve adults who are parents of children . They went through the dialogue at least once , just to make sure that the chatbot works as intended and that the conversation is coherent . This led to minor modifications to the conversational flow . We then ran a user test with the chatbot at the same after - school center as the co - design session above . We aimed to identify potential usability issues that needed fixing , but also to gauge the overall user experience especially whether the chatbot is pleasant and engaging to interact with . The entire session was supervised by the researcher and the supervisor working at the after - school facility . The evaluation plan was approved by the ethical committee of ( removed for anonymity ) university . 5 . 2 . 1 Methods . A co - discovery learning approach [ 23 ] was fol - lowed where the children worked in two pairs of friends allowing us to capture their spontaneous verbalization and gain insights into their experience of the chatbot . Four children ( three boys and one girl ) took part in the session , with an average age of 10 ( SD = 0 . 25 ) . Two participants ( CP3 , CP4 ) had previously participated in the co - design session . Participants were informed about the con - tents of the evaluation session beforehand and were free to take part or leave the session at any time . Participants pairs were given a tablet or laptop to interact with the chatbot and were asked to fill in the chatbot together ( Figure 5 ) . At all times , they were able ask questions or make remarks about the chatbot to the researcher or to each other . At the end of the session the researcher asked a few questions to the children pertaining to their user experience . 5 . 2 . 2 Results . Participants easily understood and answered all the questions the chatbot asked them , except for two participants ( CP1 , CP2 ) who mentioned that certain questions were asked in an illog - ical order or that they lacked space to add detail , e . g . , to describe the origin of sleeping problems that night . Overall , the evaluation gave us confidence that children aged eight to twelve can use the chatbot to report on their sleep . One participant ( CP1 ) asked if the self - reporting chatbot was able to interact in spoken language rather than written text and showed visible disappointment when told that this was not possible . At the end of the session , other 303 IDC ’22 , June 27 – 30 , 2022 , Braga , Portugal Tessa Aarts et al . Figure 5 : Evaluation session setup with pairs of participants filling in the experience sampling chatbot together . participants ( CP3 , CP4 ) also indicated their preference for a voice - based version of the chatbot as they thought it would be more fun to have a vocal conversation . 5 . 3 Field - test We carried out a field - test was to evaluate how the children use the system independently at home and to assess whether and how the usage could be sustained for longer periods of time . 5 . 3 . 1 Methods . Participants were recruited through an electronic leaflet distributed through social media by a medical expert special - izing in treating children with sleep disorders . The leaflet’s content and design addressed the children , but was distributed through social media to parents who responded to our invitation after dis - cussing with their children . We thus received 17 positive replies , but eventually only five ( three boys and two girls ) with an average age of 10 ( SD = 1 . 5 ) , followed through with their promise . The inclusion criteria were that the participants should be able to read and write at a simple level in their native language ) . No criteria were set regarding the presence of sleep problems . The study set up was approved by the ethics board of the Eindhoven University of Technology . The parents of the children all signed a consent form before participation . Children were free to take part or leave the session . We briefed each participant individually , in the presence of at least one of their parents about the purpose , setup , and tasks of the experiment . All briefing sessions were held digitally using an online video platform given restrictions on no face - to - face meetings relating to the third wave of the Covid - 19 pandemic . Participants were instructed to interact with the chatbot on their own using a browserURLon theirowndevice . Duringevaluation , childreneither used tablets or computers / laptops based on personal preferences / availability / familiarity . The chatbot works ( the exact same way ) on all three devices , so children could use the medium they preferred . Participants could complete a full conversation daily over the course of seven days . It has been suggested that to assess adherence to an experience sampling protocol a study duration of around five study days should suffice [ 29 ] . To include a weekend in the study , which is relevant for sleep tracking , we asked participating children to use the chatbot for seven days , preferably in the morning waking up . However , if participants were unable to do so in the morning , they were also allowed to use the chatbot later in the day . After the field test a brief debriefing interview was held remotely to capture their experience from using the bot . 5 . 3 . 2 Results . Children started and finished their study on differ - ent dates and different days of the week . They all interacted with the chatbot easily and without parental assistance . Furthermore , two children who had a mild form of dyslexia ( CP3 , CP5 ) said that little effort was needed to read and understand the chatbot’s ques - tions . This is further supported by the quality of the open answers they gave to the chatbot . Participants who slept well took less effort to answer to the chatbot and even skipped days ( CP1 , CP5 ) , while children who slept poorly engaged with the chatbot consistently . Two children ( CP2 , CP4 ) who reported occasional sleeping prob - lems even asked permission to continue using the chatbot after the field test had been finished . Participants CP2 , CP3 and CP4 who had occasional sleeping problems set a daily schedule for us - ing the chatbot , e . g . , during breakfast , and engaged with it more consistently than those who did not . This suggests that children with sleeping problems may more easily recognize the value of consistent self - reporting than those without . Participants CP1 and CP3 found the chatbot rather repetitive . Participants noticed that interaction was longer if they would report the had slept poorly than if they would report the had slept well . This suggest the need to balance dialogue length to avoid satisficing responses [ 5 ] . They also noticed that from day to day they would be asked similar questions and had to repeat the answers , whereas they expected the chatbot to recall their earlier answers . This suggests the need to improve upon the conversational variety and adaptation when repeatedly engaging with the same self - reporting tool over a longer period . Three of the field - test participants ( CP3 , CP4 , CP5 ) had expected to interact vocally with the chatbot , as the information given to participants had not explained that the term chatbot refers to textual rather than vocal conversation . In both the field test and the user experience test , younger par - ticipants ( ages eight to ten ) seemed to find the chatbot to lack color and pictures and would have liked to choose the background , the chat icon , and the color themselves . Older participants ( aged 11 - 12 ) generally found the chatbot design to be sufficient , noting how it feels calm and not distracting . This suggests that the current design is more tuned to children aged 11 - 12 , and some adaptations may be needed to address the younger end of our targeted age group . 6 DISCUSSION This research has motivated and documented the design of a chatbot - based sleep diary targeting children from eight to twelve , as a tool to help clinicians get subjective sleep quality reports directly from children . The field test of Snoozy has clearly demonstrated the efficacy of collecting self - report on sleep quality for a week at least , a period that is relevant and useful for supporting clinical practice , which typically requires patients to keep a diary for one or two weeks . We have shown that chatbots can help clinical prac - titioners and sleep scientists to obtain reliable sleep quality data directly from children in our target age group rather than indirectly 304 Snoozy : A Chatbot - Based Sleep Diary for Children Aged Eight to Twelve IDC ’22 , June 27 – 30 , 2022 , Braga , Portugal through the parents . We have also learnt several lessons that apply generally to chatbots that will be designed for this or similar pur - poses . For example , we saw how a fun character like an animal is appreciated , that the language should be very direct and concrete , text entry should be minimized by using pre - defined options , the chatbot needs to tread a fine balance between being expressive and showing empathy on the one hand , and avoiding to treat the child as a weak and needy conversant . Nnext to designing the chatbot with an eye to the needs of clinical practice it should also include some fun elements that make the conversation flow more natural and that show that the chatbot learns more about the child through interacting with it and adapts its questions accordingly . The design and evaluation of the experience sampling chatbot Snoozy illustrates the relevance and feasibility of chatbots as a way to collect sustained personal health information from children , addressing a gap in related literature , as for example argued by Meltzer et al [ 24 ] . During the design , several decisions were made based on the input of a small number of children , e . g . , to use animal characters to represent the chatbot . We could gain more confidence in this design direction with more extended field studies involving larger and more diverse samples of children and perhaps in different contexts . Such evaluations and subsequent iterative improvements could help ensure that the chatbot has a wide appeal and is fit for its purpose of collecting subjective sleep data from children in our target age range of eight to twelve . Future studies could explore how such a data collection can be triangulated by different assessment techniques and especially parental report , to guide clinical practice , as the chatbot has been evaluated and tested on children’s engagement and usability , but not yet on the validity of the data . Future studies could also explore the effectiveness of different devices on which the children interact with the chatbot , as traditional devices such as a phone , laptop or tablet could distract from the reporting tasks due to the many different interaction possibilities . The chatbot design itself could be enhanced with empathic abili - ties as has been illustrated with EREN [ 31 ] , or to sustain a single thread of conversation over the whole sampling period , in order for the chatbot to be recognized as a conversational partner to which the child returns day after day . Future developments could examine the use of speech - based interaction instead of chatbots to support the dialogue about sleep especially with younger children . The challenge addressed with Snoozy and the form of the solu - tion bare obvious similarities to personal informatics for children , and especially chatbots developed to support children self - track activities and even sleep [ 19 ] [ 7 ] . They also have some substantial differences . In personal informatics use is discretionary , possibly open - ended serving potentially personal interest and self - discovery [ 28 ] . On the other hand , digital tools for patient - physician commu - nication are serving the requirements of scientifically supported clinical practice which dictates the purpose and character of the designed interaction , subordinating children’s preferences to the requirements of adults and experts . Despite these constraints inher - ent to a healthcare context , such digital tools are no less supportive of children’s competence and autonomy . Improving the communi - cation between children and clinicians , could potentially improve the evidence on which clinicians base their treatment and empower children as stakeholders in their own healthcare . Including children in the design of these tools as was done here with Snoozy rather than adapting adult - oriented applications to children serve this overarching aim . However , designing a usable and engaging appli - cation is only but a first step this in transforming the interaction between children , parents , and clinicians . Future research is needed , to consider interactive solutions in this field holistically and exam - ine how the implementation of such digital tools in clinical practice could impact on how children interact with treating physicians and how using them could influence their treatment . 7 CONCLUSION We have presented the design of Snoozy , a chatbot that helps collect sleep quality data from children aged eight to twelve . The contribu - tion of this paper is to fill an important gap in the tools available to support the diagnosis and treatment of sleep problems , using chat - bots as an instrument for collecting subjective report from children over sustained periods of time instead of more traditional diaries . Chatbots can complement parental report and tracking technolo - gies that are currently used for assessing sleep . More generally , our study is encouraging regarding the potential and further de - velopment of chatbots as tools to support clinical practice but also scientific studies in a fun and engaging way . Further research could examine the range of data that can be collected and how to extend reporting over sustained periods of time . 8 SELECTION AND PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN This paper has described an iterativedesign process in which several sub - studies involved children . For all these sub - studies separate ethical approval was obtained from the Eindhoven University of Technology . Informed consent was obtained from the parents of the children , while children could choose not to take part in the activities at any moment . A co - design session was conducted at an after - school center , where all children of the group were welcome to participate . There was no exclusion of children . Informed consent was obtained from the parents , while children could choose whether to take part or not . The user experience evaluation ( single session ) was also conducted in the same center following the same approach . For the field - test of Snoozy we recruited participants through a clinician who published a leaflet advertising our study on social media . 17 children or their parents responded directly to her re - garding their interest . Inclusion criteria were that children should be able to read and write in their native language ; informed con - sent was obtained from the parents of the children , and they could also decide at any moment to leave the study . While we did not exclude any children , eventually only five participated in the actual field - test . The children were exposed to no risks . All sub - studies were engaging and interesting enough for them to participate , which was confirmed when they wanted to continue longer on the co - design assignment or to use the chatbots for after the field - test duration . There were no medical concerns noted and it was made clear that we were intent on developing and improving a chatbot rather than providing remedy to any possible sleep problems . 305 IDC ’22 , June 27 – 30 , 2022 , Braga , Portugal Tessa Aarts et al .
