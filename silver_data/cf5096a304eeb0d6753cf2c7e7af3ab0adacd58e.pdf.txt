Using ‘core documents’ for the representation of clusters and topics Wolfgang Gla¨nzel • Bart Thijs Received : 18 January 2011 / Published online : 10 February 2011 (cid:2) Akade´miai Kiado´ , Budapest , Hungary 2011 Abstract The notion of ‘core documents’ , ﬁrst introduced in the context of co - citation analysis and later re - introduced for bibliographic coupling , refers to the representation of the core of a publication set according to given criteria . In the present study , the notion of core documents is extended to the combination of citation - based and textual links . It is shown that core documents deﬁned this way can be used to represent and describe doc - ument clusters and topics at different levels of aggregation . Methodology is illustrated using the example of two ISI Subject Categories selected from applied and social sciences . Keywords Core documents (cid:2) Cluster analysis (cid:2) Hybrid clustering (cid:2) Bibliographic coupling (cid:2) Text mining Introduction Scientometric analysis of the cognitive - epistemological structure of science is traditionally based whether on citation links ( e . g . , bibliographic coupling , cross - citation , co - citation analysis ) and textual links ( co - word analysis , term representation ) . Both approaches have their own advantages and shortcomings . The main advantage of citation - based methods is beyond doubt their discriminative power . This is contrasted by a serious disadvantage : Citation - link matrices are extremely sparse and citation - cased methods tend to ‘‘under - estimate’’ relationships among documents . Furthermore , citation links generate binary measures which are based on value 0 or 1 according as there is a citation or reference link between two documents or not . By contrast , most text - based measures are based on term frequencies in documents , which as such provide a natural weight underlying the similarity or distance measures used for the analysis . Link matrices are furthermore less sparse than their counterparts in the citation space . These advantages are cancelled out by two serious W . Gla¨nzel ( & ) (cid:2) B .

At least the latter problem can be compensated by singular value decomposition ( SVD ) or directly by latent semantic indexing ( LSI ) , which also uses the ﬁrst - mentioned algorithm . Another problem arises from the underlying vocabularies . Science mapping based on clustering of a given document space can preferably apply hybrid techniques using citation - link and both clustering . This approach is used to improve efﬁciency with respect to the two individual components when separately applied and thus to overcome some of their limitations described above . The idea of combining citation link - based clustering and text - based approach aimed at pronouncing the advantages of the two components and , at the same time , at reducing the by - effects of their shortcomings . This was ﬁrst suggested by Braam et al . ( 1991a , b ) and Zitt and Bassecoulard ( 1994 ) in the context of improving the efﬁciency and usability of co - citation and co - word analysis . In particular , one of the objectives was to improve the apparently low recall of co - citation analysis concerning current work . The combination of link - based and textual methods also makes it possible to cluster objects whenever citation links are weak or missing . This feature is , above all , important in the applied sciences , most ﬁelds of the social sciences and in the humanities . In the present study , the citation - based component uses biblio - graphic coupling , which has several advantages compared to co - citation analysis ( Gla¨nzel and Czerwon 1996 ) . The advantage of this combination has been conﬁrmed in recent studies by Glenisson et al . ( 2005 ) and Boyack and Klavans ( 2010 ) as well . Furthermore , the textual component can be used to label the obtained clusters . While in global clus - tering , i . e . , in the clustering of a complete database or a larger parts of it , the textual component can be used to label the obtained clusters , in local clustering , such as the analysis of ISI Subject categories , the common vocabulary often distorts the procedure in smaller subjects or topics . At this level of aggregation , terms and phrases might become less speciﬁc since they express common knowledge base and vocabulary . Other might gain ‘‘information value’’ . For instance , the terms ‘algebra’ and ‘group’ have different signif - icance in the global and local environment . ‘Algebra’ provides speciﬁc information at the global level but is redundant at the local one within the ﬁeld of algebra . The term ‘group’ might only be used for global clustering as part of speciﬁc phrases like ‘Lie group’ , ‘nilpotent group’ , ‘locally compact group’ , etc . Within the ﬁeld of algebra , however , the term ‘group’ is practically speciﬁc enough to identify a topic . The most obvious approach to label or to represent clusters and topics is using TF - IDF terms or keywords . Because of the above - mentioned problems more sophisticated solutions have been developed but most are based on text mining ( e . g . , Lamirel and Attik 2008 ) . In the present study we propose an alternative method to supplement or even replace labels based on best TF - IDF terms by core documents representation . A further advantage of this method is that core documents proved to express centrality as has shown in the context of hybrid journal clustering ( cf . Zhang et al . 2009 ) . Methods The notion of a ‘‘core’’ of literature goes back to co - citation analysis ( Small 1973 ) , where documents belonging to such a cluster , by deﬁnition , formed a set of considerably cited papers . The term ‘core documents’ was anew introduced by Gla¨nzel and Czerwon ( 1996 ) in the context of bibliographic coupling to identify those papers which form important 298 W . Gla¨nzel , B . Thijs 123 nodes in the ‘global’ network of scholarly communication . The original deﬁnition was based on Boolean vector - space model for bibliographic coupling ( Sen and Gan 1983 ) . In the present study , the notion of ‘core documents’ is extended to a hybrid approach . The link component is adopted from the original idea by Gla¨nzel and Czerwon using bibliographic coupling while the textual component is based on term frequencies , where terms are extracted from and stemmed for titles and abstracts . Keyword phrases are kept and stop words are removed . This hybrid approach is applied to the local level that is to the aggregation level of narrow disciplines and research topics . Since citation - based and lexical similarities among individual documents are based on different cosine measures , particularly , binary for citations and measures using weights based on term frequencies for the lexical case , and similarities are usually dominated by the lexical component , a simple linear combination of the two similarity measures does not provide satisfactory results . A more appropriate method is based on Fisher’s inverse v 2 - method ( cf . Janssens et al . 2009 ) . The linear combination of angles forms an interesting alternative to Fisher’s inverse v 2 - method for handling similarities from different metrics and offers the opportunity of smoothly adjusting the weight of either component . Therefore a linear combination of the angles underlying the citation - and text - based similarities is used for the identiﬁcation of the core documents . Since the link - based component , that is citation , reference or co - authorship links , are less sensitive to the above - mentioned aggregation - level effect more emphasis is given to the citation - based component . In particular , core documents in the hybrid case with linear combination of angles are deﬁned as follows . Following the deﬁnition by Gla¨nzel and Czerwon ( 1996 ) , core documents are papers that have at least n links of at least a given strength r according to the given similarity measure . In the present hybrid case this measure r is deﬁned as the cosine of the linear combination of the underlying angles , i . e . , Fig . 1 Keyword representation of clusters in the Subject Category ‘Public Health . ’ Data sourced from Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge ( formerly referred to as ISI Web of Science ) Using ‘core documents’ for the representation of clusters and topics 299 123 r ¼ cos k (cid:2) arccos ð g Þ þ ð 1 (cid:3) k Þ (cid:2) arccos ð n Þ ð Þ ; k 2 ½ 0 ; 1 (cid:4) ; where g is the citation - based and n the textual similarity . k denotes the free parameter for the linear combination and arccos ( g ) and arccos ( n ) , respectively , denote the two underlying angles . In practice , n & 10 proved an appropriate multipurpose threshold along with r = 0 . 25 ( see Gla¨nzel and Czerwon 1996 ) , or r = 0 . 34 . These similarities correspond to angles of about 75 (cid:3) and 70 (cid:3) , respectively . Core documents should ideally represent about 0 . 1 – 1 . 0 % of the original set . Thus core documents can in a way be considered an efﬁcient tool for ‘‘dimensionality reduction’’ . Although we have applied core document representation to describe clustersobtained from ahierarchical cluster analysis , theproposed methodologyand thus the use of core documents might be completely independent of clustering exercises as they might serve as representatives of the core of any given document set . Results In order to apply core documents to represent and to describe publication clusters , ﬁrst a hybrid cluster analysis of two selected ISI Subject Categories has been conducted . In a second step , an analysis of core documents in the corresponding ISI Subject Category as well as in the obtained clusters has been conducted independently of the cluster algorithm . It should be stressed , that core documents are not used as a source for alternative clus - tering , although the link structure of these documents can readily be visualised using network diagrams ( as we will show in the course of this study ) . Core documents will actually be used to represent : Fig . 2 Core - document representation of the Subject Category ‘Public health’ ( Pajek ; Kamada - Kawai ) .

Thijs 123 • important topics within the subject under study and • clusters obtained from document classiﬁcation . Although the topic representation by core documents is , otherwise , completely inde - pendent from the clustering algorithm , in this study core documents and clusters are determined using the same similarity measures . Data for the present study have been retrieved from Thomson Reuter’s Web of Science ( WoS ) . Two ISI Subject Categories have been selected for demonstration , particularly , • public , environmental & occupational health and • energy & fuels . We have chosen these subject categories because both disciplines proved rather ‘‘resistant’’ to structural analysis in bibliometrics . We provide core - document representa - tion at different levels of aggregation , particularly in subﬁelds and those topics within subﬁelds , which have been found by hybrid clustering . In order to obtain consistent results , the same similarity measures are used for clustering and for representation . Public , environmental & occupational health The ﬁrst Subject Category under study is ‘‘Public , environmental & occupational health’’ . The underlying publication period is 1999 – 2000 . In this period 20 , 726 documents indexed as articles , letters , proceedings papers or reviews were assigned by ISI to this subject . The hybrid cluster analysis provided eight clusters which have been suggested based on Table 1 Selected core documents of the Subject Category ‘Public Health’ ISI UT - code Document title 000083945800017 Correcting for ascertainment bias in the COGA data set 000083945800041 Evidence of linkage in subtypes of alcoholism 000070064300002 The vibroacoustic disease—an emerging pathology 000079064300012 Morphofunctional study of rat pleural mesothelial cells exposed to low frequency noise 000086917200015 The epidemiology of schistosomiasis in Egypt : summary ﬁndings in nine governorates 000086966500005 Organochlorines and endometrial cancer risk 000084811800011 Repeated measurements of organochlorine exposure and breast cancer risk ( Denmark ) 000084734900018 Cancer mortality and environmental exposure to DDE in the United States 00008o386900005 Health status evaluation with the SF - 36 survey : preliminary results in Mexico 000078302800022 Using YPLL in health planning 000165512400017 The effect of income inequality on the health of selected US demographic groups 000086537600011 The social gradient In life expectancy : the contrary case of Okinawa in Japan 000089485700008 Daily deaths are associated with combustion particles rather than SO 2 in Philadelphia 000083843000018 Mortality and air pollution : associations persist with continued advances in research methodology 000085800100005 A proactive health plan : taking action on tobacco control 000085718400019 Case study of attempts to enact self service tobacco display ordinances : a tale of three communities 000078878700001 Comparison of a parasite lactate dehydrogenase - based 000079285300003 The epidemiology of multiple Plasmodium falciparum infections 000089186400031 Experiences in calibration with three different types of phantom Data sourced from Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge ( formerly referred to as ISI Web of Science ) Using ‘core documents’ for the representation of clusters and topics 301 123 corresponding silhouette values ( cf . Rousseeuw 1987 ) . Figure 1 presents these clusters using the best TD - IDF keywords . The keyword representation already reﬂects the com - plexity of this discipline in and adequate manner . Figure 2 shows the core - document representation of this discipline as visualised using Pajek ( Batagelj and Mrvar 2003 ) . ISI – UT codes downloaded from the WoS along with titles , keywords , abstracts and source information are used as document identiﬁers . Part of the core documents form more or less large clusters but the six unconnected papers in Fig . 2 may not be considered ‘singletons’ since , by deﬁnition , they have at least ten strong links each ( and consequently even more weaker links ) to other papers in the same cluster . In order to avoid confusion , we have to stress that the clusters in Fig . 2 formed by core documents do not necessarily coincide with the eight clusters obtained from the hybrid document clustering . Links between core documents and groups of them large and by follow the structure of the above eight clusters but , at the same time , core documents reﬂect the internal structure of those clusters as well . Titles , keywords and abstracts of core documents provide substantial information about the clusters and their sub - topics . Selected core documents of the ISI Subject Category ‘Public Health’ are presented in Table 1 . These documents clearly represent different sub - disciplines of this subject cate - gory . Genetics of alcoholism , tobacco control , vibro - acoustic disease , various forms of cancer risk , malaria and local parasitic disease , premature mortality , the correlation between social situation and health , environment and health are just some of the most important topics which position the discipline in between medical and social sciences . In order to zoom in on this subject category , we have selected Cluster # 2 for further analysis . This cluster comprises 5826 papers . The best TF - IDF keywords of this cluster are : Fig . 3 Core - document representation of Cluster # 2 in ‘Public health’ ( Pajek ; Kamada - Kawai ) .

Finally , the more isolated core documents at the right - hand side and the bottom of the ﬁgure refer to different topics on health risk and education . Energy & fuels The second subject category selected for this study is ‘‘Energy and fuels’’ . The underlying publication period for this discipline is 1999 – 2003 . In this period 31 , 462 articles , letters , proceedings papers or reviews were found in this discipline . The hybrid cluster analysis provided seven clusters for this subject . Figure 4 presents the best TD - IDF keywords representing the obtained clusters . Again , a complex , however clear disciplinary structure is obtained . New energies as well as new technologies in traditional power generation and fuel production , and mathematical models are represented by these clusters . Cluster # 4 , for instance , covers batteries and electricity storage , Cluster # 5 stands for renewable energy and related techniques and Cluster # 3 is concerned with more theoretical aspects , such as mathematical modelling , with economic aspects and with issues of efﬁciency and optimisation . The same diversity is reﬂected by the core documents within this subject category . Figure 5 visualises the core - document structure of the discipline based on the Kamada - Kawai Model using Pajek . Four ‘‘clusters’’ surrounded by numerous closely linked and unlinked core documents can be found in the centre of the map . Table 3 presents a selection of these papers with their titles and ISI - UT codes following the above - mentioned structure . The titles reveal an interesting structure that can be considered more than a supplement to the above structure obtained from the above cluster analysis .

Two groups of these documents form bigger clusters in Fig . 6 . A third set of papers form a smaller group while the remaining papers are relatively separated .

Conclusions Core documents proved to be more than supplements to the TF - IDF representation of the outcomes of clustering exercises . It was shown that hybrid techniques can smoothly be applied to the re - deﬁnition of core documents . The three free parameters k , n and r can be used for ﬁne tuning . In the social sciences and humanities a lower k value can be used to compensate missing citation links .

As has been shown in an earlier study by Gla¨nzel and Czerwon ( 1996 ) , the applied method works even for young subject matters if the bibliographic coupling component is predominant . Core documents can also be used for data retrieval , namely to identify further relevant docu - ments by following their strong and medium - strong hybrid links .
