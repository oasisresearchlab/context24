Germany ( Received June 21 1996 ) In an earlier study the authors have shown that bibliographic coupling techniques can be used to identify ' hot ' research topics . The methodology is based on appropriate thresholds for both number of related documents and the strength of bibliographic links . Those papers are called core documents that have more than 9 links of at least the strength 0 . 25 according to Salton ' s measure , provided they are articles , notes or reviews . This choice resulted in a selection of nearly one per cent of all papers of the above types recorded in the 1992 ' annual cumulation of the SCI . Core documents proved important nodes in the network of documented science communication . In the present study , the set of core documents is analysed by journals , subfields and corporate addresses . The latter analysis is conducted on both national and regional - institutional level . First all countries which have published at least 20 core documents in 1992 are investigated in terms of their research profiles , their international collaboration patterns and their citation impact . Finally , those eight members of the European Union which have published at least 20 core documents in 1992 are analysed in respect of regional and institutional distribution of core documents . Introduction Among the various methodologies that have been developed within the framework of quantitative science studies in view of specific applications to research assessment , computer - aided cluster techniques play an important part . These methods are ranging from co - citation and co - word mapping to bibliographic coupling . * Permanent address : Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences , ISSRU , P . O .

CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION The well - known and widely used method of co - citation clustering was introduced independently by Small 1 and Marshakova . 2 The concept of bibliographic coupling was proposed more than three decades ago by Kessler . 3 The decisive difference between these both methods is that in the first case two or more papers sharing one or more common source documents form the cluster and in the second case the cluster appears when two or more documents are cited together in the reference list of a third document . Despite the consequences of this difference the two methods are often confused or wrongly considered equivalent . Though , from the technical point of view , both co - citation and bibliographic coupling analyses are based on the processing of reference lists , co - citation procedures are analysing reference pairs , i . e . , cited papers , whereas bibliographic - coupling methods proceed from those citing papers which share items in their reference lists . Consequently , co - citation techniques are always based on sets of at least fairly cited papers , and further citation analyses are unnecessary . On the other hand , documents which have strong bibliographic links with other papers do not imply fair or high citation rates in subsequent periods after their publication . Citation analyses of bibliographically linked papers are therefore an important validation tool substantiating that coupling procedures do not lead to a deadlock in terms of scientific communication . Up to now the technique of bibliographic coupling has been applied very rarely for purposes of research evaluation ( cf . King4 ) . This fact is surprising because the bibliographic coupling concept has obviously advantages compared with co - citation clustering . The most important one is that just published papers that are closely related by bibliographic coupling links can provide snapshots of early stages of a specialty ' s evolution . By contrast , it may take time before a ' critical mass ' of papers on a new research topic is created that is needed to produce the highly cited publications on which the co - citation mapping is based ( HicksS ) . In a comprehensive validation study by Vladutz and Cook 6 could be shown " that the utilization of bibliographical coupling in very large citation databases is practically feasible and that in 76 % of the cases it yields valid results by providing for each input publication 2 - 3 otlier publications from the same year , that are closely related by subject " . That is why the method of bibliographic coupling may prove a valuable alternative to other mapping methods , especially , because this technique is immediately available and applicable after publication of a body of literature that does not only contain cited documents . It should be noted that bibliographic - coupling methods can also be combined with co - word and / or co - citation analyses to obtain additional information or to improve the reliability of the individual methods . Especially in a paper by Sharabchiev 7 it was 196 Scientometrics 37 ( 1996 ) W . GL , ~ NZEL , H . J . CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION shown that both techniques provide comparable results of the structure of research front specialties and complement each other . In a recent paper ( Gli ~ nzel and Czerwon 8 ) the authors have demonstrated that bibliographic coupling can be used , apart from its possible application to classical information retrieval and the macro level analysis of science structure , to identify research - front or core documents which represent recent ' hot ' and other research - front topics . Besides the methodology only global journal , subfield and country characteristics of the found core document set could be studied but the paper aimed rather at the development of a proper methodology . Important aspects of the analysis based on corporate addresses such as national and regional research front profiles , international and regional collaboration , the identification of research - front centres in both regional and institutional respect could , however , not be taken into consideration so far . The detailed investigation of these aspects at the macro and meso level had therefore to be left to the present study . In the methodological part of the present study we give a concise review on both the theoretical background and bibliometric aspects of data processing . The subsequent section is devoted to the analysis of core documents by subfields and journals , followed by the macro analysis of the most active 23 countries . In particular , research profiles , international collaboration patterns and citation impact of core documents published in these countries have been studied . The study concludes with a meso analysis . The distribution of core documents among regions and institutions ( universities , non - university areas etc . ) in eight selected countries of the European Union ( Belgium , Denmark , France , Germany , Italy , Netherlands , Spain and United Kingdom ) is discussed in detail . Methodological aspects The method which proceeds from the model suggested by Sen and Gan 9 has already been introduced in the above - mentioned paper by Gldnzel and Czerwon ( cf . Ref . 8 ) . In order to ensure the intelligibility of the following applications , it is , however , indispensable to give a brief description of the underlying methodological rudiments . The total set of scientific literature generates a Boolean vector space which is , particularly , defined by the relationship of papers published in a given period and the set of all references cited by them . Assume that all m references cited in all n papers in question are arranged and indexed in some order . The elements of the space are Boolean vectors representing the publications , their jth compontent ( 1 < _ j < _ m ) takes then the values 1 or 0 according as the paper cites the references j or not . The Scientometrics 37 ( 1996 ) 197 W . GLANZEL , H . J . CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION document - reference assignment of the total paper set published in a given period and indexed in some sequence can then be represented by a huge n x m Boolean matrix A . Without the loss of generality we assume that the rows consist of the publication ( document ) vectors d i ( 1 < _ i < _ n ) and the colunms represent the reference vectors rj ( 1 < j < m ) .

A hypothetical Boolean matrix representing the relationship publications - references The matrix A in its present form does , so far , not reveal anything about bibliographic links and their strength . Sen and Can have , therefore , suggested to use the Coupling Angle ( CA ) as a coupling measure . It is defined as the cosine of two Boolean vectors which can be obtained from their scalar product as follows di ' d j CA ( didj ) = ( 1 ) Idi ' tdjl The Coupling Angle , CA , takes then the value 1 if two Boolean vectors are parallel , and CA = 0 if they are rectangular . The strength of bibliographic coupling of two papers can thus be visualized as the angle between the corresponding Boolean vectors . This may help to find appropriate thresholds based on its geometrical interpretation . Papers represented by rectangular vectors are independent , those represented by parallel vectors are concerned with identical topics . Two documents may then be considered to be concerned with a related topic if the angle between the vectors representing the documents does not exceed a given angle ~ ( 0 ~ < ~ p < 90 ~ For 198 Scientometrics 37 ( 1996 ) W . GL . g , NZEL , H . J . CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION example , the choice of ~ o = 60 ~ results in a threshold CA = 0 . 5 , and the angle ~ o = 75 ~ corresponds to a threshold CA = 0 . 25 . In Ref . 8 Glginzel and Czerwon have shown that in the above case the Coupling Angle is identical with Salton ' s measure ( rij ) . Thus we have CA ( didj ) = rij and a ' geometric ' interpretation of Salton ' s measure in terms of the angles between two Boolean vectors . Matrices representing bibliographic links and their strength can be readily derived from the Boolean matrix _ A _ as introduced above . The product matrix B = A - A T provides the number of joint references of the given papers . An example for such a ' bibliographic - link ' matrix is given in Fig . 2 . Finally , the matrix R = Diag ( B _ ) - l / 2 " B ' Diag ( B ) - l / 2 = rij = CA ( didj ) contains Salton ' s measure of the strength of the bibliographic link of all pairs of papers . A more popular definition regards Salton ' s measure as the ratio of the number of joint references and the geometric mean of the number of references of the two papers concerned . Bibliographic coupling is without any restriction a symmetrical relation . Moreover r takes the value 1 for the strength of the bibliographic link of any paper with itself . In contrast to several oflaer bibliometric phenomena such as , e . g . , international collaboration , this makes sense because the relationship of any paper to itself must be considered maximum . These properties guarantee that Salton ' s measure is an appropriate measure of the strength of bibliographic coupling . nxn Pl P2 P ~ Pi P .

Matrix representing the number of joint references in a given paper set Usually papers are considered related in the sense of bibliographic coupling if they share at least one reference . We have decided to restrict the analysis to a subset of linked documents based on some considerably stronger conditions . In order to eliminate accidental links , papers are therefore considered bibliographically coupled if they are linked with a strength of at least rik = 0 . 25 . By definition , those papers are considered core documents that have at least n = 10 links of this strength provided Scientometrics 37 ( 1996 ) 199 W . GL , ~ NZEL , H . J . CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION they are articles , notes or reviews . The choice of these thresholds are based on both experience and theoretical considerations . Instead of the above pair of thresholds , slightly modified values may be used as well and may lead to similar results . The number of links should , howex ~ er , not be much less than 10 . Otherwise results could be influenced by papers published in series . These papers are usually strongly linked . A number of links much greater than 10 , say , for example , 20 or 25 would eliminate ' smaller ' research topics . Very young and small subdisciplines have not enough papers to be identified by coupling techniques if the threshold n is too large . At the same time r values much less 0 . 25 do not sufficiently filter noise . Many publications refer to ' standard ' documents which are not necessarily characteristic for their topic . On the other hand , the number of found documents dramatically decreases with growing r . The following statistics may serve as an illustration . At the level r = 0 . 25 altogether 229775 links could be found which resulted after selecting the three document types and removing papers with less than 10 links in 4534 publications . At the level r = 0 . 33 the number of links reduced to 93194 and at r = 0 . 50 only 19542 links have been obtained which resulted after filtering according to document type and number of links in altogether 3 publications . In order to obtain still representative sets , the value of r should clearly lie below 0 . 3 . Letters to the Editor proved to cause artefacts in connection with bibliographic coupling , particularly , in numerous cases a great number of letters proved to be concerned only with one particular contribution published somewhat earlier in the same journal . Therefore this document type has been omitted . The following study , especially , the citation analysis will show that core documents really deserve their name . Data analysis All data have been taken from the annual cumulations of the Science Citation Index ( SCI ) of the Institute for Scientific Information ( ISI , Philadelphia , PA , USA ) . 4534 papers , i . e . , 0 . 89 % out of altogether 511 , 899 articles , notes and reviews recorded in the 1992 volume of the SCI proved to have at least 10 related papers each that are linked with them with a strength of at least r = 0 . 25 . 86 . 8 % of the identified core documents are indicated as articles , 8 . 6 % as notes and 4 . 6 % as reviews . By contrast , the corresponding distribution of all processed publications ( articles , notes and reviews ) recorded in the 1992 annual volume of the SCI over document types reflects the following patterns : 89 . 8 % articles , 7 . 7 % notes and 2 . 5 % reviews . Though there is a slight shift towards notes and reviews in the set of core documents , the deviation of the two distributions can hardly be considered significant . The distribution by co - 200 Scientometrics 37 ( 1996 ) W . GL , ~ NZEL , H . J . CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION authors reveals further interesting details in terms of validation . The extremely skew frequency distribution is presented in Fig . 3 . A core document has 4 . 5 authors on an average , but the median is only 3 . This is caused by the extremely long tail of the distribution , in particular , the maximum number of co - authors is 104 . On the other hand , almost three quarters ( 72 . 4 % ) of all core documents have at most 5 authors , and only 2 . 4 % have more than 10 authors . These facts clearly tell against any assumption of possible ' citation cliques ' underlying the conception of core documents . 20 , G0 % 18 , 00 % 16 . 00 % 14 . 00 % 12 . 00 % ~ 10 . 00 % 8 . 00 % 6 . 00 % 4 . 00 % 2 . 00 % 0 . 00 % 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 : 20 Nurnl ~ ol ' CO - luaus Fig . 3 . Frequency distribution of core documents by the number of their co - authors A detailed analysis of both key words in titles of core documents and uncontrolled terms by which these papers are indexed by the ISI indicates that important research - front topics are represented in the publication set under consideration . All topics of cancer research are represented by altogether 471 core documents , AIDS research by 227 papers , hepatitis by 133 , Alzheimer disease by 77 publications , superconductivity by 131 , quantum - weU structures by 47 , LASER and applications by 63 , quantum Hall effect by 24 , superlattices by 70 , molecular - beam epitaxy by 36 , scanning tunneling microscopy by 29 , chaos and self - organization by 25 , fractals by 11 and fuzzy systems by 33 documents . The young topicfullerenes is represented by nearly 100 documents . This list is by far not complete , and if we take into account that topics are overlapping ( e . g . , fullerenes and superconductivity ) this list covers only about 30 % of all \ identified core documents . The result of several expert questionings show that most \ core documents belong to the few papers of a specialty that had a very high impact . In this way the findings confirm that papers connected by strong bibliographic coupling links can provide insights into the structure of research fronts ( see Ref . 4 ) .

CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION Analysis of ' core documents ' by subfields and journals The bibliometric analysis of core documents by subfields reveals interesting details about focal research topics . Core documents have therefore been assigned to 128 subject categories based on ISI ' s journal classification . The assignment is not unique , one paper can be assigned to up to three different subfields if the journal in which it was published offers publicity for papers of various topics . Besides the absolute number , the percentage of core documents of the given subfields and two advanced bibliometric indicators were calculated . The Relative Subject Share ( RSS ) is defined as an analogon to the Activity Index ( AI ) ( see Schubert and Braun , 1 ~ Schubert et al . ll ) . It expresses the proportion of the share of core documents of a given subfield and the share of all papers of this subject . It can be calculated according to the following formula . RSS = the given subfield ' s share in all core documents ( 2 ) the given subfield ' s share in world ' s publication output In verbal terms , RSS indicates if a subfield is represented above , according to or below expectation . RSS = 1 expresses the accordance with the expectation , RSS > ( < ) 1 indicates that more ( less ) core documents are concerned with this subfield as expected . In order to analyse the significance of the deviation from the expectation ( RSS = 1 ) the w - statistics is calculated . Its approximate formula is w = 1 - ( 1 / RSS ) . x / n , ( 3 ) where n is the number of core documents of the subfield in question . The above equation provides good approximations if the world ' s publication output of the given subject is sufficiently large as compared with . Since the share of all core journals is less than 1 % of the total publication output in 1992 this condition is obviously met . For further details consult Ref . 11 . The deviation of the RSS values from their expectation 1 is considered significant at the confidence level 95 % if w > 1 . 96 or w < - 1 . 96 , respectively . Table 1 presents the above indicators for all subfields with at least 20 core documents . Subfields are ranked by RSS values . Subfields with less than 20 articles have been omitted because the conclusions drawn from their statistica l analysis would not be reliable . 202 Scientometrics 37 ( 1996 ) W . GL , ~ NZEL , H . J .

At a first glance the great RSS values 204 Scientometrics 37 ( 1996 ) w . GLA , NZEL , H . J . CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION for mathematics ( miscellaneous ) and operations research seems to be somewhat unexpected . The analysis by journals , however , shows that these subfields are represented by papers published in the journal Fuzzy Sets and Systems only . The distribution of core documents over journals is extremely skewed and polarized . Core documents could be detected in 809 out of altogether 3241 journals covered by the 1992 volume of the SCI . That is , 75 . 0 % of all journals do not contain core documents . The mean of the distribution of core documents over journals is 1 . 40 , its standard deviation 6 . 13 . The maximum number of core documents published in one journal is 217 . It should be mentioned that besides highly specialised journals also the ' great ' multidisciplinary journals Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ( rank 2 with 148 documents ) , Nature ( rank 16 with 51 documents ) and Science ( rank 21 with 37 documents ) are among the journals with the most core documents . Core documents published in these journals are concerned with several different topics . Table 2 presents number and share of core documents in journals with at least 20 core documents . Analysis of ' core documents ' by corporate addresses at the national level Share of ' core documents ' For this analysis , all countries , regions and institutions indicated in the address field have been taken into account . Publication counts can therefore not be summed up over addresses . A percentage of a country x of p % in core documents or in the total publication output then means that p % of the core documents ( or all papers , respectively ) have at least one author with an address in country x . The same applies m . m . to the analysis of regions and institutions , too . At each level of aggregation duplicates have been discarded , i . e . , one ' core document ' has been assigned to one country ( region or institution , respectively ) only once . In order to obtain statistically reliable results , only countries with at least 20 core documents have been taken into consideration . Besides the number of the countries ' core documents and their share in all papers published by the country , their share in all core documents has also been calculated . This share is compared with that of all papers published by the country in the world total .

The above indicators are presented in Table 3 . The strikingly great share of USA and Japanese core documents in all core documents is worth mentioning . Further countries with remarkable research effort in research - front topics are Japan , UK , Germany and France . The relatively small share of Canadian and Italian core documents is , however , somewhat unexpected . Among 206 Scientometrics 37 ( 1996 ) w . GLANZEL , H . J . CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION the analysed countries also USSR , India , Australia , Spain and Poland proved to produce significantly less core documents as expected based on the world standard , whereas Switzerland and Finland belong to the countries with a relatively great share of such papers . The other eight countries correspond to their expectation . The set of core documents deserves a much deeper macro analysis by corporate addresses . In the following we will therefore deal with the national research profiles , with international collaboration as reflected by co - authorships of core documents and with different aspects of national citation impact . National research profiles of ' core documents ' The first question arising from the point of view of national research evaluation focusses on the research profiles : What are the focal points in national ' hot ' research , and do they follow the general trends of national research policy ? Seeing that the core - document size in most countries is less than 500 , the only applicable method is the comparison of profiles based on the five major fields life sciences , physics , chemistry , engineering and mathematics . By the same reason we have omitted the direct numeric comparison between national profiles of core documents and those of all documents . The great random error caused by small sample sizes does not allow such comparisons , in case of Finland , for example , each individual paper has the weight of about 2 % . The percentages of core documents and all papers assigned to the major science fields are presented in Table 4 . Note that the field assignment is based on journal classification . Since the assignment of journals to fields is not unique , the shares cannot be summed up to 100 % . The great relative share of the life sciences in core documents , in particular , of the subfields virology , genetics , biochemistry , cancer , biology ( general ) , immunology , biophysics embryology and the topics AIDS and retroviruses , hepatitis and Alzheimer disease has already been stressed by Gliinzel and Czerwon . 8 Though the share of core documents in chemistry is in almost all countries much below the corresponding share of all chemistry papers , the representation of ' hot ' topics in chemistry such as fullerenes has already been pointed out . The same applies to mathematics research . The share of subfields mathematics ( miscellaneous ) and operationsresearch , and especially the topics chaos and self - organization , fractals and fuzzy systems are above their expectation . Nevertheless , mathematical core documents have been published in very few countries . In this context , the special situation in India is worth mentioning . The distribution of Indian core documents contradicts the national publication structure . Almost one quarter of all core documents are concerned with mathematical topics , Scientometrics 3 " 7 ( 1996 ) 207 w . GL ) i . NZEL , H . J . CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION alone 18 of them deal with fuzzy structures . On the other hand , the share of the otherwise prevailing life sciences decreases to less than one sixth for core documents . In all other countries the typical research profiles are reflected by core documents , too , i . e . , either predominant research in life sciences ( developed countries ) or in physics and chemistry ( Eastern Europe and PR China ) could be observed .

GLANZEL , H . J . CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION International collaboration reflected by ' core documents ' International collaboration has been analysed as reflected by international co - authorship links . Altogether 762 core documents have been published as the result of international collaboration . On an average 2 . 27 countries have been involved in preparing an international core document , and only 11 papers had co - authors from 5 or more different countries .

The latter indicator can be used as some national ' reference standard ' . , As expected , international collaboration plays an important role in research front topics . Since core documents proved to hold key positions within the framework of scientific communication , the collaboration behaviour of their authors is assumed to exceed standard co - authorship activities . Indeed , the share of core documents published in international collaboration in almost all analysed countries was definitely greater than its expectation . Belgium , Denmark , Canada , Italy , Poland , Sweden and Scientometrics 37 ( 1996 ) 209 w . GL . ~ NZEL , H . J . CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION Spain , proved to be most active in terms of international collaboration . Their index values range from 50 % to 62 . 5 % . But the values of other countries ( Australia , Austria , Finland , France , Germany , Netherlands , UK and USSR ) also substantiate that research in hot topics is connected with intense international co - authorship links . It is worth mentioning , that in case of USSR this share amounts almost one half for core documents , whereas the corresponding share for all papers is only about one tenth . On the other hand , Japan , Talwan , New Zealand , PR China and India do not follow this trend . New Zealand , PR China and especially India have less internationally co - authored core documents as expected . In case of India this phenomenon may be explanable , since the Indian research profile focusses on mathematics , a field in which ( international ) collaboration is by far not as frequent as , say , in physics or life sciences . In China , where more than three quarter of all core documents are concerned with physics , the small share ( 20 . 3 % ) of internationally co - authored documents is rather unexpected . Finally , the number of other countries contributing to the publication of a country ' s core documents shows that international collaboration is not restricted to joint projects with one single country or a small group of countries . The majority has co - authorship links with scientists of 20 or more other nations each . In case of Taiwan , China and New Zealand , the small numbers of countries involved can rather be explained with the small number of co - authorships themselves . If the number of country links is considered in the context of the general indicators mentioned at the outset ( 2 . 3 countries involved in an average document and 11 papers with more than 4 affiliations in different countries ) , we can conclude that most internationally co - authored core documents are the result rather of several bilateral and trilateral collaboration with numerous different countries than of only a few great multi - national research projects . Citation analysis of ' core documents ' As the last step in the investigation of national data , a citation analysis has been conducted . All citations received by core documents during the two - year period 1992 - 1993 have been determined and compared with the corresponding journal impacts which have been calculated for the same citation window . By technical reasons the reference standards for the citation analysis ( impact factors ) - have been determined based on all articles , letters , notes and reviews recorded in the 1992 annual cumulation . Since the share of letters to the editor in all papers of the above document types amounts to 6 . 20 % in 1992 , the influence of possibly deviating citations patterns of letters to the editor is inconsiderable and can therefore be neglected . 210 Scientometrics 37 ( 1996 ) w . GLANZEL , H . J . CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION For the cross - national analysis the following statistics have been used . 1 . Percentage of cited core documents . The share of those core documents has been determined which have been cited in 1992 - 1993 . 2 . Mean Observed Citation Rate ( MOCR ) . The number of citations received by core documents in 1992 - 1993 has been divided by the number of core documents . 3 . Mean Expected Citation Rate ( MECR ) . This indicator is defined analogously to the preceding one . Instead of the number of citations , the impact factors of the journals ir ~ which the documents have been published are summed up . The impact factors have , of course , to be calculated for exactly the same period as the citation rates of core documents . MECR can be interpreted as a weighted average impact factor where the weights are the shares of documents published in the corresponding journals ( see Refs 10 - 11 ) . 4 . Relative Citation Rate ( RCR ) . RCR is defined as the ratio of MOCR and MECR . It indicates if the citation impact of the paper set under study is above ( RCR > 1 ) or below ( RCR < 1 ) average . RCR = 1 expresses the exact aCcordance v ? ith ' the reference standard . 5 . Percentage of documents cited above average . The share of those core documents has been determined the citation rate of which were at least as great as the impact factors of the corresponding journals ( cf . Gldnzel and Schubertl2 ) . 6 . Number of highly cited papers . A paper is considered highly cited if it has received at least k ( k > 1 ) times as many citations as an ' average ' papers of the same journal ( see Gldnzel and Schubert , 13 Glfinzel and Czerwonl4 ) . If the impact factor of the journal in which the paper has been published is less 1 , the value k is chosen as the threshold . The value k expresses the level at which highly cited papers are identified . The level k = 5 has been chosen because the percentage of highly cited papers becomes immeasurable in several countries , otherwise . The results are presented in Table 6 . The set of core documents contains more than 10 times as many highly cited papers as the total publication output in similar periods ( cf . Ref . 14 ) . The small share of uncited papers ( 15 . 7 % ) as well as the extremely great RCR value of the world total substantiate that the majority of core documents have a great impact on topical research . Because of the great share of highly cited documents ( about one tenth at the level k = 5 and almost two thirds of the papers were cited above average ) core documents may also be considered an appropriate key for identifying outstanding research performance .

Though the Relative Citation Rate of each country is greater than 1 ( except for Taiwan ) , and both Mean Observed Citation Rate and Mean Expected Citation Rate are greater than the mean citation rate ( 1 . 66 ) of all citable items of the 1992 cumulation of the SCI , great differences can be observed among the indicator values of the countries . Thus , for example , all core documents with an author from New Zealand have been cited , 60 . 9 % of them above average , but only 4 . 3 % can be considered highly cited . By contrast , the same share of French core documents have been cited above average , but ' only ' 81 . 6 % of the documents have been cited at all , whereas 11 % of them have to be regarded as highly cited . It is worth mentioning that the percentage of highly cited core documents of eight countries exceeded 10 % , namely , in Sweden , UK , Belgium , Netherlands , France , USA , Denmark and Poland . In this context , it should be stressed 212 Scientometrics 37 ( 1996 ) w . GL , ~ NZEL , H . J . CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION that less than 10 % of Swiss , Swedish and Israeli core documents remained uncited in the period 1992 / 1993 . Both Mean Observed and Expected Citation Rate are conditional indicators , that is , the underlying theoretical probabilities and expectations are conditional ones . The share of uncited items can , for example , be interpreted as the probability P ( X = 01 63 , where X denotes the citation rate of a randomly chosen paper , and C is the condition that the paper is a core document . By analogy , we have E ( XI 6 " ) for the MOCR of the world total and r , iP ( Ji163 . E ( XJ i ) for the corresponding MECR , where Ji denotes the event that the paper has been published in the ith journal . The two expressions do not necessarily take the same value , in particular , we have E ( X I C ) = ~ iV ( JilC ) . E ( Xl Ji ) , ( 6 ) if the event that a paper is published in the ith journal is for all i independent of being a core document or not . Moreover , then we have the equality E ( X ) = E ( XI 63 , too . In Ref . 8 Gltinzel and Czerwon have given empirical evidence that this condition is not met , i . e . , the number of core documents published in a journal is not correlated with its size . The two different values , MOCR = 9 . 35 and MECR = 4 . 45 , clearly illustrate this effect . In case of all papers , we have , of course , E ( X ) for both the MOCR and MECR of the world total . 12 . 5 10 7 . 5 2 . 5 J ITA ESP 1 P ' ~ c ~ - rwN 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 3 . 5 MECR ISR AUS I . . . .

CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION indicate the world averages of MOCR ( 9 . 35 ) , MECR ( 4 . 45 ) and RCR ( 2 . 10 ) . Again , the plot visualizes the heterogenity of national citation indicators . The mean citation rates are widely scattered , they range from less than 2 ( both MOCR and MECR ) to almost 6 ( MECR ) and about 12 ( MOCR ) , but reflect similar national characteristics as observed in the usual charts based on all citable papers . Analysis of European ' core documents ' at the regional and institutional level In order to deepen the analysis and to locate European regions of research from activity as reflected by core documents , we have selected those countries which were members of the European Union in 1992 . To draw valid conclusions , we have chosen only those EU members with at least 20 core documents , i . e . , the countries Belgium , Denmark , France , Germany , Italy , Netherlands , Spain and UK . Greece ( 7 core documents ) , Ireland ( 10 core documents ) , Luxembourg ( no core documents ) and Portugal ( 4 core documents ) had to be omitted . All locations with at least 5 core documents are presented in a map ( Figure 5 ) , for which addresses have been decomposed according to observed regional collaboration . Thus again , the items can not be summed up to national totals . The following five zones have been built . 1 . Locations with at least 100 core documents 2 locations could be found : London ( 165 items ) and Paris ( 160 items ) 2 . Locations with 50 to 99 documents 3 locations : Heidelberg ( 77 items ) , Amsterdam ( 53 ) and Cambridge ( 51 ) 3 . Locations with 20 to 49 items 5 locations in Germany , 4 in the United Kingdom , 4 in France , 3 in Italy and 1 each in the other selected countries 4 . Locations with 10 to 19 items 11 locations in Germany , 5 in Italy , 4 each in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , 3 in France and 1 each in Belgium , Denmark and Spain 5 . Locations with 5 to 9 items 13 locations in Germany , 10 each in the United Kingdom and France , 6 in Italy , 2 in Belgium , 1 each in the Netherlands and Spain In this context it should be mentioned that Dublin ( Ireland ) with 7 documents was the only location with more than 4 core documents in those EU countries which have otherwise not been analysed .

Locations with at least 5 core documents in countries of the European Union Interpreting the map , we should always keep in mind that we are analysing absolute numbers which have to be considered in the mirror of tota / research activity . Therefore we will hardly find research - front ' centres ' in areas with otherwise low research activity . The strikingly great activity in the areas of London and Paris is , therefore , not unexpected . The same applies to the Alsace , Grenoble and the Mediterranean coast in France , Rome and Northern Italy , Madrid and Barcelona in Spain . The greatest number of locations can be observed in the United Kingdom and Germany and France . Core documents have been published at 62 different locations in Scientometrics ' 37 ( 1996 ) 215 W . GL . ~ NZEL , H . J . CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION the United Kingdom , and at 56 locations each in Germany and France . By contrast , 44 locations could be detected in Italy , 16 each in Spain and the Netherlands , 11 in Belgium and 10 in Denmark . Although these numbers are expected to proportionally grow with the countries ' total publication activity , the great number of locations with more than four items in Germany ( 30 ) in connection with the absence of a real national centre reflects the most decentralized activity patterns in the set of selected countries . The Greater Munich area including Martinsried and Garching can be considered the only German agglomeration which does , however , still rank behind Heidelberg . By way of contrast , we could detect 20 locations with more than 4 core documents in the UK and 18 in France , but they include the agglomerations in the extended areas of London and Paris , respectively . Because of the special situation in the second year after reunification we should pay some attention to the regional distribution of German core documents . As expected , most locations have been found in Bavaria , Baden - Wiirttemberg , Hesse and North Rhine - Westphalia . It must be stressed that the second greatest location in Germany , Berlin ( 49 items ) , has 11 contributions from East - Berlin . 9 of the core documents have been published at the Humboldt University . Further 6 locations ( Leipzig , Dresden , Jena , Halle , Rostock and Wernigerode ) with altogether 15 different affiliations can be found in the five new states ( Bundesld ~ der ) . Besides the strikingly great number of core documents in London ( 165 ) , Paris ( 160 ) , Heidelberg ( 77 ) , Amsterdam ( 53 ) and Cambridge ( 51 ) , the activity at several other locations , for example , in Grenoble ( 40 ) , Leuven ( 24 ) and Martinsried ( 20 ) requires an additional analysis based on institutional addresses . In general , we can state that most institutional addresses found in the bibIiographic data of core documents refer to universities . In the following we will discuss some further institutional aspects . Countries are discussed in descending order of their ouput in core documents . - Table 7 presents all British universities with at least i0 core documents . Except for London , the number of documents published by universities covers almost all core documents prepared at these locations . 112 papers have addresses from non - university institutions in London . In the non - university research area the Medical Research Council ( MRC ) and the Agriculture and Food Research Council ( AFRC ) play an important role . Thus 13 core documents with a corporate address in Cambridge have been published by the MRC , 5 by the AFRC . - Though universities contribute a great share of German core documents ( altogether 306 addresses belong to German universities ) , a considerable part of documents has been published at non - university institutions , too .

Among the International Research Institutions , the European Molecular Biology Laboratory ( Heidelberg ) published 21 core documents . National Research Centres are represented by the Forschungszentrum J ~ lich GmbH ( KF ~ ) with 12 core documents and the Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum ( DKFZ ) in Heidelberg with 7 documents . Both the activity at the university ( see Table 8 ) and the non - university research at the above institutions explain the high activity in Heidelberg . Among the industrial research represented by altogether 21 core documents the Boehringer - Mannheim GmbH with 6 contributions is worth mentioning .

By way of contrast , almost all core documents with an address in Gif - sur - Yvette have been published by the Centre for Nuclear Studies Saclay ( CENS ) . The share of the non - university academic area is also considerable at the locations Montpellier ( 16 of 27 documents by the National Institute for Health and Medical Research ( INSERM ) ) and Grenoble ( 17 of 40 documents by the Centre for Nuclear Studies ( CEN ) and / or the Institute Max von Laue - Paul Langevin ) . - Ranks of Italian universities by core document counts are presented in Table 9 . Beyond the university research , the National Institute for Nuclear Physics ( INFN ) at different locations had 13 core documents in 1992 . Non - university hospitals and medical research institutions have published altogether 59 documents .

All Dutch universities with at least 10 documents are presented in Table 10 . Table 10 Ranking of Dutch universities by core documents ( N > 9 items ) Location Items Univ(cid:12)9 Nijmegen 22 Univ .

CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION - Two Belgian universities , particularly , the Catholic University of Leuven ( 29 documents ) and the University of Brussels ( 13 documents ) should be mentioned . Departments of the Catholic University of Leuven are located in Brussels and Heverlee , therefore , the number of core documents published by the Catholic University ( 29 ) is somewhat greater than the number of those published in Leuven ( 24 ) . - The Spanish Research Council ( CSIC ) has contributed with 16 core documents . The addresses are in part located at the universities of Madrid , Barcelona and Zaragoza . - Most Danish core documents have university addresses , in particular , 14 from the University Copenhagen and 13 from the University Aarhus . Beyond that , the Rigshospital ( Copenhagen ) with 4 documents and the Niels Bohr Institute ( Copenhagen ) with 3 documents should be mentioned . The analysis of European core documents by institutions shows again , that ' hot ' research is not restricted to certain well - known centres nor to special , great research facilities . The predominant role of the universities in almost all analysed locations is a consequence of and in keeping with the national research structure in the respective countries . Concluding remarks The macro - analysis of core documents allows the following conclusions . Core documents represent recent ' hot ' and research - front topics . The applied method works even for young subject matters . Both the distribution of core documents over document types and co - authors correspond to those of all SCI publications of the analysed document types . In this context some possible limitations of the applied methodology should be mentioned . According to our experiences , artefacts produced by the above bibliographic coupling procedure are statistically inconsiderable . Among the citable document types , only Letters to the Editor proved problematic . Strictly speaking , this type does not really cause artefacts in connection with bibliographic coupling since related letters tend to be concerned with a joint topical question , but usually they do not represent any research front . Therefore , we decided to omit this document type . Bibliographic coupling techniques are , however , somewhat sensitive to the length of the chosen publication period . A relatively short period , say a span not longer than 2 years seems to be appropriate for bibliometric analyses . Though we have not any Scientometrics 37 ( 1996 ) 219 W . GLANZEL , H , J . CZERWON : BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUPLING AND ITS APPLICATION empirical evidence , we suppose that for medium or long - term observations ( 5 - 10 years or more ) bibliographic coupling does not reflect the relationship between documents in an adequate manner . In particular , the reference structure of related papers changes because of the incorporation of more topical , e . g . , citing papers into the reference lists thus weakening the strength of bibliographic links . On the other hand , if the chosen period ' is restricted to several months publication sets become small and some ' hot ' topics have then not enough papers to meet the strict criteria given by the thresholds . Therefore , we consider a period of 1 / 2 year - 2 years as the most appropriate for bibliographic coupling analyses . The methodology seems to be somewhat biased in favour of the life sciences . Indeed , most core documents can be found in biomedical subfields . But topics such as cancer research , AIDS research , hepatitis , Alzheimer disease are among others some of the most topical challenges in scientific research . It should , however , be stressed that the representation of otherwise small disciplines ( mathematics and operations research ) among core documents is significantly above their share in the SCI database In contrast to our expectations , core documents were not only published in specialised journals . General and multidisciplinary journals rank also among the preferred publication channels of research - front topics . Because of their high citation impact core documents hold a key position in science communication . By zooming in on topics , i . e . , by adding all related papers , almost the complete research - front literature can be covered in a next step .
