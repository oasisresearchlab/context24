In the case of type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) , this situation is caused by a total absence of endogenous insulin secretion , which impedes the use of glucose by most tissues . In these circumstances , exogenous insulin supplies are necessary to maintain patient’s life ; although caution is always needed to avoid acute decays in glycaemia below safe levels . In addition to insulin administrations , meal intakes and physical activity are fundamental factors inﬂuencing glucose homoeostasis . Consequently , a successful management of T1D should incorporate these two physiological phenomena , based on an appropriate identiﬁ - cation and modelling of these events and their corresponding eﬀect on the glucose - insulin balance . In particular , artiﬁcial pancreas systems – designed to perform an automated control of patient’s glycaemia levels – may beneﬁt from the integration of this type of in - formation . The ﬁrst part of this PhD thesis covers the characterization of the acute eﬀect of physical activity on glucose proﬁles . With this aim , a systematic review of literature and meta - analyses are conduced to determine responses to various exercise modalities in patients with T1D , assessed via rates - of - change magnitudes to quantify temporal variations in gly - caemia . On the other hand , a reliable identiﬁcation of physical activity periods is an essential prerequisite to feed artiﬁcial pancreas systems with information concerning exercise in am - bulatory , free - living conditions . For this reason , the second part of this thesis focuses on the proposal and evaluation of an automatic system devised to recognize physical activity , classifying its intensity level ( light , moderate or vigorous ) and for vigorous periods , iden - tifying also its exercise modality ( aerobic , mixed or resistance ) ; since both aspects have a distinctive inﬂuence on the predominant metabolic pathway involved in fuelling exercise , and therefore , in the glycaemic responses in T1D . Various combinations of machine learning and pattern recognition techniques are applied on the fusion of multi - modal signal sources , namely : accelerometry and heart rate mea - surements , which describe both mechanical aspects of movement and the physiological response of the cardiovascular system to exercise . An additional temporal ﬁltering module is incorporated after recognition in order to exploit the considerable temporal coherence ( i . e . redundancy ) present in data , which stems from the fact that in practice , physical activity trends are often maintained stable along time , instead of ﬂuctuating rapid and xxv repeatedly . The third block of this PhD thesis addresses meal intakes in the context of T1D . In par - ticular , a number of compartmental models are proposed and compared in terms of their ability to describe mathematically the remote eﬀect of exogenous plasma insulin concentra - tions on the disposal rates of meal - attributable glucose , an aspect which had not yet been incorporated to the prevailing T1D patient models in literature . Data were acquired in an experiment conduced at the Institute of Metabolic Science ( University of Cambridge , UK ) on 16 young patients . A variable - target glucose clamp replicated their individual glucose proﬁles , observed during a preliminary visit after ingesting either a high glycaemic - load or a low glycaemic - load evening meal . The six mechanistic models under evaluation here comprised : a ) two - compartmental submodels for glucose tracer masses , b ) a single - compartmental submodel for insulin’s remote eﬀect , c ) two types of activations for this remote eﬀect ( either linear or with a ‘cut - oﬀ’ point ) , and d ) diverse forms of initial conditions . xxvi Resumen en castellano La diabetes comprende un conjunto de enfermedades metabólicas que se caracterizan por concentraciones de glucosa en sangre anormalmente altas . En el caso de la diabetes tipo 1 ( T1D , por sus siglas en inglés ) , esta situación es debida a una ausencia total de secreción endógena de insulina , lo que impide a la mayoría de tejidos usar la glucosa . En tales circunstancias , se hace necesario el suministro exógeno de insulina para preservar la vida del paciente ; no obstante , siempre con la precaución de evitar caídas agudas de la glucemia por debajo de los niveles recomendados de seguridad . Además de la administración de insulina , las ingestas y la actividad física son factores fundamentales que inﬂuyen en la homeostasis de la glucosa . En consecuencia , una gestión apropiada de la T1D debería incorporar estos dos fenómenos ﬁsiológicos , en base a una identiﬁcación y un modelado apropiado de los mismos y de sus sorrespondientes efectos en el balance glucosa - insulina . En particular , los sistemas de páncreas artiﬁcial – ideados para llevar a cabo un control automático de los niveles de glucemia del paciente – podrían beneﬁciarse de la integración de esta clase de información . La primera parte de esta tesis doctoral cubre la caracterización del efecto agudo de la actividad física en los perﬁles de glucosa . Con este objetivo se ha llevado a cabo una revi - sión sistemática de la literatura y meta - análisis que determinen las respuestas ante varias modalidades de ejercicio para pacientes con T1D , abordando esta caracterización median - te unas magnitudes que cuantiﬁcan las tasas de cambio en la glucemia a lo largo del tiempo . Por otro lado , una identiﬁcación ﬁable de los periodos con actividad física es un requisito imprescindible para poder proveer de esa información a los sistemas de páncreas artiﬁcial en condiciones libres y ambulatorias . Por esta razón , la segunda parte de esta tesis está enfocada a la propuesta y evaluación de un sistema automático diseñado para reconocer periodos de actividad física , clasiﬁcando su nivel de intensidad ( ligera , moderada o vigo - rosa ) ; así como , en el caso de periodos vigorosos , identiﬁcando también la modalidad de ejercicio ( aeróbica , mixta o de fuerza ) . En este sentido , ambos aspectos tienen una inﬂuen - cia especíﬁca en el mecanismo metabólico que suministra la energía para llevar a cabo el ejercicio y , por tanto , en las respuestas glucémicas en T1D . En este trabajo se aplican varias combinaciones de técnicas de aprendizaje máquina y re - conocimiento de patrones sobre la fusión multimodal de señales de acelerometría y ritmo cardíaco , las cuales describen tanto aspectos mecánicos del movimiento como la respues - ta ﬁsiológica del sistema cardiovascular ante el ejercicio . Después del reconocimiento de patrones se incorpora también un módulo de ﬁltrado temporal para sacar partido a la con - siderable coherencia temporal presente en los datos , una redundancia que se origina en el hecho de que en la práctica , las tendencias en cuanto a actividad física suelen mantenerse estables a lo largo de cierto tiempo , sin ﬂuctuaciones rápidas y repetitivas . El tercer bloque de esta tesis doctoral aborda el tema de las ingestas en el ámbito de la T1D . En concreto , se propone una serie de modelos compartimentales y se evalúan éstos en función de su capacidad para describir matemáticamente el efecto remoto de las concetraciones plasmáticas de insulina exógena sobre las tasas de eleiminación de la glucosa atribuible a la ingesta ; un aspecto hasta ahora no incorporado en los principales modelos de paciente para T1D existentes en la literatura . Los datos aquí utilizados se obtuvieron gracias a un experimento realizado por el Institute of Metabolic Science ( Universidad de xxvii Cambridge , Reino Unido ) con 16 pacientes jóvenes . En el experimento , de tipo ‘clamp’ con objetivo variable , se replicaron los perﬁles individuales de glucosa , según lo observado durante una visita preliminar tras la ingesta de una cena con o bien alta carga glucémica , o bien baja . Los seis modelos mecanísticos evaluados constaban de : a ) submodelos de doble comparti - mento para las masas de trazadores de glucosa , b ) un submodelo de único compartimento para reﬂejar el efecto remoto de la insulina , c ) dos tipos de activación de este mismo efecto remoto ( bien lineal , bien con un punto de corte ) , y d ) diversas condiciones iniciales . xxviii Part I Introduction 1 Chapter 1 Introduction 1 . 1 Motivation The present PhD thesis work was carried out under the research area on ‘Applied tech - nologies for the management of diabetes’ at the Biomedical Engineering and Telemedicine Group , Universidad Politécnica de Madrid . The main purpose of this research area is to use information and communication technologies ( ICT ) to empower the management of diabetes – in its diﬀerent conditions – by patients and caregivers . Research topics include , but are not restricted to : glucose predictors , decision support systems for the personalized adjustment of insulin therapy , closed - loop glucose control algorithms ( artiﬁcial pancreas ) , and telemedical platforms to track diabetological care data , as well as to monitor and pro - mote healthy diets and physically active lifestyles . The general term diabetes encompasses various metabolic diseases characterized by abnor - mally high blood glucose concentration levels ( hyperglycaemia ) at fasting conditions , in turn caused either by an defective secretion and / or by an impaired action of the insulin hormone . Sustained hyperglycaemia inﬂicts serious damages in diﬀerent tissues , which in the long term may lead to cardiovascular problems , renal failure or blindness , among other severe complications . On the other hand , acute episodes of severe hypoglycaemia – or conversely , hyperglycaemia with ketoacidosis – may be life - threatening . Currently , diabetes is one of the diseases with highest prevalence : approximately 9 % of world’s population in 2014 according to estimations by the WHO [ World Health Organi - zation , 2015 ] . Despite being non - communicable , its large growth rates led the WHO to consider diabetes as a worldwide epidemic , closely related to the incidence of overweight and obesity . Furthermore , WHO projections place diabetes as the seventh most frequent cause of death worldwide by 2030 [ Mathers and Loncar , 2006 ] . In this context , intense research eﬀorts are being conduced from diverse perspectives : ranging from immunological and gene therapies to cure diabetes , to technological solutions designed to ease the daily management of the condition ( e . g . smart insulin bolus advisors ) and to monitor and pro - mote healthy lifestyles – diet , physical activity – which can improve overall diabetologic care . In this regard , meal intakes and physical activity , along with exogenous insulin admin - istrations ( if prescribed ) , are the main external factors inﬂuencing glucose homoeostasis . For this reason , reliable quantitative information about subjects’ degree of involvement in physical activity – its frequency , duration , intensity or type of exercise – may constitute a valuable contextual input , e . g . to assess patients’ adherence and compliance with exercise 3 1 . 2 . Outline plans or for artiﬁcial pancreas systems incorporating the acute eﬀects of exercise on glucose concentrations [ Chassin et al . , 2007 ; Breton , 2008 ; van Bon et al . , 2011 ] . However , current ‘gold standard’ techniques to quantify physical activity are not practical in ambulatory , free - living environments . As a result , authors from the ﬁeld of sport sciences [ Ainslie et al . , 2003 ; Plasqui and Westerterp , 2006 ; Westerterp , 2009 ] advocate for solutions incorporating simultaneously both accelerometry – which provides objective measurements of motion mechanics – , as well as heart rate – as a physiological response to exercise – , in order to overcome the limitation of each technique when applied by separate . This PhD thesis document presents , compares and evaluates an automated system to classify phys - ical activity working on data obtained by the fusion of these two sources of information . Machine learning methods are employed to enhance the robustness of the classiﬁers by the automatic recognition of informative signal patterns and temporal trends in data . Another essential perspective for the consolidation of artiﬁcial pancreas systems as glucose controllers in type 1 diabetes is the enhancement of the patient models on which vari - ous control strategies are supported , to extend the physiological aspects covered by these models . Resulting from a research visit and collaboration with the Institute of Metabolic Science ( University of Cambridge , UK ) , data were made available from a clinical exper - iment which addressed the absorption patterns of meal glucose in patients with type 1 diabetes . Those experimental data are used in this PhD thesis work to develop and to validate a mechanistic model reﬂecting the eﬀect of plasma insulin concentrations on the disposal rates of meal - attributable glucose , an aspect which had not yet been incorporated to patient models . 1 . 2 Outline The present PhD thesis document is structured in six parts : • Part I , formed by chapters 1 – 2 , introduces the motivation and context of this work and presents the hypotheses and objectives which drove research . • Part II , containing chapters 3 and 4 , overviews several clinical and physiological aspects in relation to diabetes and exercise . In particular , chapter 4 contains a systematic review and meta - analysis addressing the quantitative characterization of the acute response to physical activity in type 1 diabetes , in terms of glycaemia proﬁles and their rates of change . • Part III , covering chapters 5 – 6 , focuses on techniques for the ambulatory , free - living monitoring of physical activity . After an overview of the state of the art in the measurement and recognition of exercise patterns in chapter 5 ; chapter 6 presents , compares and evaluates various machine learning - based approaches to classify au - tomatically periods of time in accordance to their intensity and exercise modality . Simultaneous processing and analysis of accelerometry and heart rate signals are employed . • Part IV , formed by chapters 7 and 8 , addresses the mathematical modelling of the metabolic system and glucose - insulin dynamics in type 1 diabetes . Chapter 8 proposes a compartmental model for the remote eﬀect of plasma insulin on the disposal of meal - attributable glucose , validating it on the basis of data from an experimental study . • Part V – chapter 9 – summarizes the main results , conclusions and contributions ex - tracted from this PhD research . Hypotheses postulated in chapter 2 and possible future work lines are discussed . 4 1 . Introduction • Part VI , in the form of Appendix A , overviews the fundamental mathematical prin - ciples behind the machine learning algorithms employed in the automated physical activity classiﬁers developed in chapter 6 . 5 1 . 2 . Outline 6 Chapter 2 Research hypotheses and objectives 2 . 1 Research hypotheses H1 : In the context of type 1 diabetes , it is possible to determine distinctive physiological responses to exercise of varying intensity and modality , and in particular to quantify their eﬀects in terms of the associated acute variations in glycaemia . Information regarding physical activity , as a phenomenon which can greatly inﬂuence glu - cose homoeostasis , should be incorporated into systems supporting the therapeutic man - agement of type 1 diabetes ( e . g . the artiﬁcial pancreas ) . Contextual aspects about phys - ical activity – such as its intensity or its modality , in close relation with the predominant metabolic pathway involved in the fuelling of exercise – should also be accounted for . A systematic literature review will be conduced to quantify these interactions . H2 : It is possible to achieve an accurate , reliable and robust monitoring of physical activity intensity and modality in free - living conditions by the simultaneous processing of multi - modal data which combine accelerometry and heart rate measurements , as well as by the application of machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in data . ‘Gold standard’ techniques to monitor physical activity are feasible in laboratory conditions but not in free - living scenarios ; whereas practical solutions , such as accelerometers and heart rate monitors , suﬀer from a number of drawbacks ( e . g . accuracy dependent on the location of the sensor , in the case of accelerometers ; or non - exercise - induced alterations in heart rate ) which limit their applicability and reliability . The simultaneous fusion of these two sources of information – as complementary descriptors of motion and physiological aspects of exercise – may provide notable beneﬁts . In addition , machine learning techniques constitute a mathematically sound framework for the extraction of informative signal patterns , which are not trivial to identify in multi - dimensional datasets by mere inspection and / or a priori knowledge . Information underly - ing in data’s temporal trends can also be exploited with machine learning - based approaches , adding robustness to classiﬁcation outcomes . H3 : It is possible to generate a mechanistic mathematical model which de - scribes the eﬀect of insulin on prandial glucose - insulin kinetics in type 1 diabetes . Currently available patient models for type 1 diabetes use compartmental formalisms to de - scribe mathematically ( in particular , via sets of mass - balance diﬀerential equations ) a num - 7 2 . 2 . Objectives ber of physiological aspects of glucose homoeostasis . These include e . g . glucose appearance and clearance , insulin absorption and action , endogenous glucose production or renal ex - cretion , among others phenomena . However , various relevant aspects of the glucose - insulin balance have not yet been incorporated into these patient models . Using experimental data from a clinical study conduced by the Institute of Metabolic Science ( University of Cambridge , UK ) , this PhD thesis will propose a novel model concerning the remote eﬀect of plasma insulin concentrations on the clearance rates of meal - attributable glucose . 2 . 2 Objectives In relation to hypothesis H1 : O1 . 1 : To develop a methodology to quantify the acute eﬀect of physical activity on gly - caemia proﬁles for type 1 diabetes , during and immediately after exercise . O1 . 2 : To apply this method to available literature in order to analyse , aggregate and com - pare quantitatively the relevant scientiﬁc evidence . Regarding hypothesis H2 : O2 . 1 : To develop a machine learning system capable of recognizing automatically temporal trends for both physical activity intensity and exercise modality , by means of the simultaneous processing of multi - axial accelerometry measurements and heart rate signals . O2 . 2 : To evaluate the classiﬁcation performance attained by this scheme when trained and tested on experimental data . With respect to hypothesis H3 : O3 . 1 : To formulate a mechanistic model to describe the role of plasma insulin on the disposal of meal - attributable prandial glucose . O3 . 2 : To validate the resulting model with experimental data from patients with type 1 diabetes . 8 Part II Diabetes and physical activity 9 Chapter 3 Diabetes The general term diabetes encompasses a set of metabolic diseases which , despite their diﬀerent aetiology and pathogenic processes , are characterized by abnormally high blood glucose concentrations ( hyperglycaemia ) which are sustained during long periods of time . These medical conditions result from defects in the secretion and / or in the action of in - sulin , the pancreatic hormone that facilitates the transportation of glucose through the cell membrane towards its interior , where glucose serves as energy source . In broad terms , de - ﬁciencies in insulin secretion or in its action – which often coexist – stem respectively from : a ) a low or absent production of insulin by the pancreas , and b ) from a diminished response to insulin by tissues , preventing its eﬃcient use [ American Diabetes Association , 2010 ] . In the long term , sustained hyperglycaemia causes severe micro - and macrovascular dam - ages in diﬀerent tissues and organs ( e . g . eyes , kidneys , nerves , heart or blood vessels ) . On the other hand , acute hypoglycaemia events – which are typically induced by an un - matched exogenous insulin administration – or conversely , episodes of hyperglycaemia with ketoacidosis , might become life - threatening for the patient . 3 . 1 Types 3 . 1 . 1 Type 1 Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) accounts for approximately 5 – 10 % of the total number of diabetes cases worldwide [ American Diabetes Association , 2010 ] . It originates from the destruction of β - cells at the islets of Langerhans , in the pancreas . These β - cells are responsible for the production and secretion of the insulin hormone . Hence , their destruction leads towards an absolute deﬁciency in terms of endogenous insulin secretion , which in turn imposes the need for exogenous insulin administrations in order to prevent ketoacidosis and to maintain patient’s life . The most common subform of T1D – sometimes referred to as type 1a – is immune - mediated [ Maahs et al . , 2010 ] , with an abnormal autoimmune reaction attacking and destroying β - cells . Although the exact etiopathogenesis of such autoimmune reaction remains still unknown , various genetic predispositions as well as the exposure to environmental fac - tors ( e . g . viral infections ) are thought to play a major role in the onset of the disease [ American Diabetes Association , 2010 ] . The rate of β - cell destruction varies notably across individuals , being rapid for some patients – especially children – and slower in other sub - jects – mainly adults – [ American Diabetes Association , 2010 ] . In this regard and although 11 3 . 1 . Types immune - mediated T1D may be diagnosed at any age , it tends to appear most frequently during childhood and adolescence . On the other hand , the idiopathic subform of T1D ( or type 1b ) constitute a minority among the total of T1D cases . Its exact aetiology is not yet well known , although a strong inher - ited component is present without evidence for autoimmune reactions [ American Diabetes Association , 2010 ] . 3 . 1 . 2 Type 2 Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) represents the ample majority of cases of diabetes , with around 90 – 95 % [ American Diabetes Association , 2010 ] . It is either linked to either an excessive insulin resistance , a decreased insulin production or to a combination of both phenomena . However and in contrast to T1D , the lowering in insulin production is in relative terms – not absolute – and not mediated by an autoimmune destruction of β - cells . Research concerning the aetiology of T2D is still ongoing , but most patients with T2D are obese ; whereas obesity is known to cause insulin resistance to some extent [ American Diabetes Association , 2010 ] . Besides , other T2D patients which would not be classiﬁed as obese according to traditional diagnosis criteria ( based on total body weight ) may have increased amounts of fat in the abdominal region . Nevertheless , genetic predisposition has an important role in the development of T2D , even stronger than for the auto - immune form of T1D [ American Diabetes Association , 2010 ] . Additional major risk factors must also be considered [ International Diabetes Federation , 2013 ] : advanced age , family history of diabetes , ethnicity , sedentary lifestyles and physical inactivity , or unhealthy diet , among others . In this regard , many T2D patients are able to manage their disease with healthy eating habits , regular physical activity and / or oral anti - diabetic medication . However , as the disease progresses and if their diabetic control worsens , some patients may need exogenous insulin supplies . T2D tends to be diagnosed during adulthood , although there is an increasing trend for its appearance in children and adolescents with sedentary life and obesity . In addition , T2D is currently experiencing a very pronounced growth worldwide , in association with phenomena such as market - economy globalization , socio - economic and demographic trans - formations ( e . g . ageing population , urbanization ) , rapid dietary changes and sedentary lifestyles [ International Diabetes Federation , 2013 ] . Furthermore , given that symptoms may take years to be apparent – a period during which hyperglycaemia already damages tissues – , T2D often remains unnoticed and undiagnosed until severe complications arise . 3 . 1 . 3 Gestational During pregnancy , women who develop gestational diabetes ( GD ) experience increased in - sulin resistance . When this additional resistance is not matched by a comparable rise in terms of insulin production , hyperglycaemia occurs . This event , which tends to appear around the 24 th week of gestation , is thought to be induced by hormonal alterations block - ing insulin action [ Hunt and Schuller , 2007 ] . Despite such insulin resistance most often disappears after delivery , it poses a notable risk on the mother of suﬀering GD in subse - quent pregnancies and / or T2D later in life [ Hunt and Schuller , 2007 ] . On the other hand , given that the foetus is at an advanced stage of formation when GD develops , the immediate 12 3 . Diabetes risk for the oﬀspring is not as severe as it would be if the mother had T1D or T2D be - fore pregnancy . Nonetheless , GD can bring serious consequences , including among others : augmented risk of future T2D for both mother and child , foetal macrosomia ( i . e . signiﬁ - cantly larger foetuses , with more complicated deliveries and possible need for a caesarean ) , preeclampsia – a life - threatening sudden rise in blood pressure – , or neonatal hypoglycaemia episodes . Current estimates calculate that approximately 7 % of pregnancies are complicated by GD , with these numbers ranging from 1 % to 14 % , depending on : a ) the population under study , and b ) the diagnostic tests employed [ American Diabetes Association , 2010 ] . 3 . 1 . 4 Others Other speciﬁc forms of diabetes exist , which aggregated may account for only 1 – 2 % of total cases [ American Diabetes Association , 2010 ] . These can be grouped into various types [ American Diabetes Association , 2010 ] : • Genetic defects of the β - cell function . Various forms of diabetes are linked to mono - genetic alterations in β - cell function , with abnormalities in six genetic loci on diﬀerent chromosomes currently identiﬁed . Insulin secretion is often impaired , but not insulin action . Besides , sustained hyperglycaemia tends generally to commence in the early adulthood – above 25 years old – , reason for which these forms of diabetes are also referred to as maturity - onset diabetes of the young ( MODY ) . • Genetic defects in insulin action . • Diseases of the exocrine pancreas , e . g . pancreatitis or pancreatic carcinoma which may lead to severe pancreatic damage and diabetes . • Endocrine disorders . Excesses of certain hormones whose action is antagonist to insulin ( e . g . glucagon , epinephrine , cortisol or growth hormone ) can cause diabetes . • Diabetes induced by chemicals or drugs which impair insulin secretion . • Infections by viruses ( e . g . congenital rubella ) associated with β - cell destruction . • Other uncommon forms of immune - mediated diabetes . • Other genetic syndromes related to an increased incidence of diabetes . 3 . 2 Prevalence and incidence The large growth rates in diabetes cases , along with its high prevalence – estimated to be approximately 9 % in 2014 among adults [ World Health Organization , 2015 ] – , have lead the WHO to consider diabetes as a worldwide epidemic [ World Health Organization , 2015 ] , in spite of being a non - communicable disease . The ample majority of cases correspond to T2D , associated with major and rapid changes in socio - economic and demographic factors , such as : ageing , obesity , unhealthy nutrition and physical inactivity – particularly among the youth – . However , there are also reports which point out unexplained increases in the incidence of T1D [ Patterson et al . , 2009 ] , as well as the progression of GD and hypergly - caemia during pregnancy [ International Diabetes Federation , 2013 ] . The most recent estimations by the International Diabetes Federation ( IDF ) indicate that approximately 382 million adults aged 20 – 79 years old suﬀered diabetes in 2013 [ Interna - tional Diabetes Federation , 2013 ] . This number represented 8 . 3 % of the total adult popu - lation in the age range 20 – 79 , causing around 5 . 1 million deaths in 2013 . Among those 382 million subjects , 175 millions – i . e . 46 % – were estimated to remain undiagnosed ( Figure 13 3 . 2 . Prevalence and incidence Figure 3 . 1 : Estimated numbers of people with diabetes [ millions ] in 2013 , divided by regions of the world . Black circle sectors represent the fraction of undiagnosed cases . ( Source : IDF Atlas 2013 [ International Diabetes Federation , 2013 ] ) . 3 . 1 ) , mainly suﬀering from T2D . In particular , Spain had 3 . 70 million cases , of which 1 . 26 millions were undiagnosed [ International Diabetes Federation , 2014 ] . In addition , the num - ber of yearly births to women with GD or high blood glucose during pregnancy reached 21 . 4 millions worldwide ( 17 % ) in 2013 [ International Diabetes Federation , 2013 ] . On the other hand , there were not marked diﬀerences in terms of sex distribution ; whereas concerning age , almost one half of the adults ( 184 millions ) belonged to the range 40 – 59 years old . More than 80 % of them lived in countries with low or middle incomes ( Figure 3 . 2 ) , hindering their access to appropriate healthcare and treatment . Remarkable increases for T2D were reported in childhood and youth , although T1D continues to be the most common form of diabetes among children and youth : with ≥ 85 % , according to the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study Group [ 2006 ] ) . Furthermore , forecasts predict more than 592 million people aﬀected by year 2035 ( Figure 3 . 3 ) , which would mean a growth by 55 % in less than 25 years’ time [ International Diabetes Federation , 2013 ; Guariguata et al . , 2014 ] . 3 . 2 . 1 Prevalence and incidence for T1D The DiaMond study [ Karvonen et al . , 2000 ; DiaMond Project Group , 2006 ] – published in 2000 and promoted by the WHO – estimated a worldwide prevalence of 4 . 5 % children in the age range 0 – 14 , with large diﬀerences ( more than 350 - fold ) in incidence across countries and regions : from 0 . 1 new cases per 100 , 000 children per year in China or Venezuela , to as many as 36 . 5 or 36 . 8 in Finland or Sardinia , respectively . To explain these variations , authors hypothesized diﬀerences in genetic factors , as well as in environmental and behavioural aspects [ Karvonen et al . , 2000 ; DiaMond Project Group , 2006 ] . Overall , Europe is the region with highest prevalence of T1D among children 0 – 14 , with approximately 129 , 000 14 3 .

( Source : Adapted from IDF Atlas 2013 [ International Diabetes Federation , 2013 ] ) . patients and an incidence of 20 , 000 new cases per year [ Patterson et al . , 2014 ] . Predictions based on 1989 – 2003 data from the EURODIAB ACE Study Group [ 2000 ] ; Lévy - Marchal et al . [ 2001 ] estimate 160 , 000 new diagnoses per year in 2020 [ Patterson et al . , 2009 ] , doubling numbers with respect to 2005 . 3 . 3 Risk factors for T1D The most widely accepted hypothesis for the aetiology of T1D is an environmentally trig - gered , auto - immune reaction against β - cells in which there is a certain role of genetically inherited predisposition [ Eisenbarth , 1986 ; Maahs et al . , 2010 ] . Regarding risk factors , the following have been identiﬁed [ Maahs et al . , 2010 ] : • Age : According to the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study Group [ 2006 ] , incidence rates increase from birth , reach their maximum in the age groups 5 – 9 and 10 – 14 and subsequently decay after puberty . Nevertheless , approximately 1 / 4 of new T1D diagnoses are adults . • Sex : Although females are most frequently aﬀected in the majority of auto - immune diseases , in the case of T1D incidences for both sexes are comparable . In addition , regions with high incidence – such as Europe , or populations of European descent – show a male excess ; whereas regions with lower incidence report a female excess [ Green et al . , 1992 ; Karvonen et al . , 1997 ] . • Ethnicity : Reports do not often address ethnicity as a risk factor in an explicit manner , presenting their data separated by countries and / or regions ( Figure 3 . 4 ) . The reasons for this choice may be based , at least partially , on the relative ethnic homogeneity within a particular country / region ; as well as on the limited size and statistical power of the sample as to address group diﬀerences . However , the highest T1D prevalences in USA were documented among non - Hispanic whites SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study Group [ 2006 ] . 16 3 . Diabetes • Genotype : There are several genes related to T1D susceptibility , the most important of which is the human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) complex located in the 6 th chromo - some . Two haplotypes are currently considered as principal markers of susceptibility , with 90 – 95 % of children with T1D carrying either or both haplotypes [ Mehers and Gillespie , 2008 ] . However , at most 5 % of the people with HLA - based susceptibility eventually develop T1D [ Maahs et al . , 2010 ] ; whereas HLA allelic variations may only explain up to 40 – 50 % of the total genetic risk component [ Concannon et al . , 2005 ] . The remaining genetic risk is associated with a considerable number of other genes , each of which contributes with modest individual impact . In addition , studies by Vehik et al . [ 2008 ] ; Hermann et al . [ 2003 ] suggest a temporal trend towards lower proportions of new T1D cases carrying high - risk HLA genotypes , which may indicate an increasing role of environmental factors . Nevertheless , T1D is strongly inﬂuenced by genetic aspects [ Maahs et al . , 2010 ] . • Other factors : Environmental triggers initiating β - cell destruction are largely un - known , although various nutritional habits have been investigated , such as : breast feeding , cow’s milk , wheat gluten , or vitamins D and E [ Maahs et al . , 2010 ] . Varia - tions in incidence in terms of geographical location and seasonality , both for the onset of T1D and for birth , have also been described [ Maahs et al . , 2010 ] . 3 . 4 Complications in T1D Among the short - term complications associated with T1D , the two most important and risky events are : i ) hypoglycaemia , and ( to a lesser extent ) ii ) hyperglycaemia with di - abetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) . DKA occurs mainly in T1D , but it may also appear in T2D for some cases [ Albright et al . , 2000 ] . DKA stems from insulin insuﬃciency , which pre - vents the use of glucose as energy source . In this situation , energy is extracted from the metabolization of free fatty acids ( FFA ) , a process in which ketone bodies are produced . In high concentrations , ketones are toxic and can lead to ketoacidosis , which may in turn bring severe acute consequences , including cerebral oedema , renal failure or heart attacks in the most extreme cases . Conversely , hypoglycaemia consists in an acute pronounced decay of blood glucose levels , which in T1D is typically originated by an unmatched ex - ogenous insulin supply ; for example , due to an incorrect amount and / or timing of insulin administration in relation to meals or physical activity . The eﬀects of hypoglycaemia range from dizziness , headache , shaking or sweating in milder cases to seizures , unconsciousness , coma , brain damage or death [ DCCT Research Group , 1997 ] . On the other hand , long - term complications can be divided in two main groups , namely : micro - and macrovascular damages . In turn , microvascular aggravations encompass mainly : • Retinopathy : Thin vessels supplying blood to the eyes – and in particular , to retina – become damaged after prolonged exposures to hyperglycaemia , high blood pressure and cholesterol . This damage may lead to severe vision loss and permanent blindness [ DCCT Research Group , 1995c ] , which makes diabetes the most frequent cause of blindness among adults in the range 20 – 74 years old . • Nephropathy : Similarly to retinopathy , vessels to the kidneys get damaged . Kidneys , which are responsible for disposing glucose excesses through renal excretion ( i . e . gly - cosuria ) , lose eﬃciency in their function or ultimately fail [ DCCT Research Group , 1995b ] . 17 3 . 5 . Treatment of T1D • Neuropathy : Prolonged hyperglycaemia may produce severe deteriorations in both the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems , causing touch insensitivity , loss of co - ordination , pain or other dysfunctions , such as problems with digestion or urination [ DCCT Research Group , 1988 ] . The most frequent damages tend to occur in extrem - ities , particularly in feet , with a loss of sensitivity which may prevent injuries from being noticed . In turn , this issue often leads to infections , ulceration , the so - called ‘diabetic foot disease’ or even amputations . Macrovascular complications include a series of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular dis - eases , e . g . : angina , stroke , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , ischemic heart or peripheral artery damage . Together they constitute the most common cause of death and disability among patients with diabetes , where the risk of suﬀering these diseases is substantially higher than for the general population [ DCCT Research Group , 1995a ] . 3 . 5 Treatment of T1D 3 . 5 . 1 Current clinical practise Tight glycaemic control to maintain glucose in safely low levels – aiming at euglycaemia , but always trying to avoid hypoglycaemia episodes – can reduce signiﬁcantly the amount and extent of complications associated with T1D [ DCCT Research Group , 1993 ] . Current care guidelines by the ADA [ American Diabetes Association , 2014 ] establish : a ) a general goal for glycated haemoglobin HbA 1c < 7 . 0 % , which broadly corresponds to an average glycaemia of approximately 150 – 160 mg / dL ( i . e . 8 . 3 – 8 . 9 mmol / L ) , b ) preprandial glucose levels below 130 mg / dl ( 7 . 2 mmol / L ) , and c ) postprandial excursions < 180 mg / dl ( 10 . 0 mmol / L ) . However , individualized adaptations of treatment and goals are strongly recommended [ American Diabetes Association , 2014 ] . In this regard , younger and healthier patients may aim to more stringent targets ( e . g . HbA 1c < 6 . 5 % ) ; whereas subjects in an advanced stage of progression of the disease , older or with complications and / or co - morbidities could have looser targets ( e . g . HbA 1c < 8 . 0 % ) . In all cases , avoiding acute hypoglycaemia events must be an essential priority . On the other hand , a decisive component for a successful treatment – specially in T1D – lies in diabetologic education to empower patients for a safe and eﬀective self - management of their disease . Primarily , patients should learn how to self - administer insulin and to monitor their glycaemia . Additionally , a highly desirable skill would be the capability to adapt therapy in accordance to diﬀerent circumstances , e . g . variations in diet with respect to their habits ( amounts , nutrients ) or changes in insulin dosages to accommodate exercise and / or other unforeseen situations . 3 . 5 . 1 . 1 Insulin therapy Two main strategies for the administration of insulin coexist in current clinical practice , namely : • Multiple daily injections ( MDI ) . This approach consists in supplying : a ) sustained basal amounts of insulin , via the injection of preparations with slow absorption and prolonged action ; plus b ) one - time boluses with high doses of rapid - acting insulin , administered immediately prior to meal intakes . This basal - bolus combination was 18 3 . Diabetes conceived to mimic the physiological secretion patterns of endogenous insulin in sub - jects without diabetes , which are approximately constant during fasting periods and show marked peaks with meals . • Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII ) . Every few minutes ( e . g . 5 to 15 min ) an electromechanic pump delivers micro - infusions of rapid - acting insulin through a subcutaneous catheter , avoids repeated injections . This strategy also provides cer - tain degree of ﬂexibility in the therapy to accommodate unpredicted circumstances , allowing for immediate adaptations in the infusion rate which are infeasible with MDI . Important problems with the subcutaneous administration of exogenous insulin – both by means of MDI and CSII – are : i ) delays in its absorption and action , along with the various sources of variability for those delays [ Heinemann and Anderson , 2004 ] , which include : insulin type , injection site , temperature and blood ﬂux , exercise , alcohol or medications , among others ; and ii ) insulin resistance , also with multiple inter - and intra - individual factors inﬂuencing it ; e . g . insulin sensitivity may ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly within a single day for the same patient , normally following circadian rhythms [ Jungheim and Koschinsky , 2002 ] . These sources of variability pose a major challenge on every therapeutic decision regarding insulin dosages . Such decisions – which patients need to make by themselves on a daily basis , several times per day – unavoidably embrace a non - negligible component of uncertainty which hinders self - management . 3 . 5 . 1 . 2 Dietary considerations In general , healthy eating habits to include a variety of nutrients in appropriate portions are an important component of a successful management of diabetes [ Evert et al . , 2013 ] , either T1D , T2D or GD . Given the wide range of personal circumstances – e . g . individual and cultural preferences , health literacy , access to healthy food choices , or willingness and ability for behavioural changes – , individualized medical nutrition therapies based on scientiﬁc evidence would be highly desirable [ American Diabetes Association , 2014 ] . If possible , patients with T1D should be capable of carrying out carbohydrate counting procedures in order to estimate suitable prandial bolus doses in accordance [ Laurenzi et al . , 2011 ] ; task for which education is essential [ DAFNE Study Group , 2002 ] . Further aspects – such as glycaemic index and glycaemic load of food – may also be taken into account , although literature in this regard is complex [ Evert et al . , 2013 ] . 3 . 5 . 1 . 3 Physical activity considerations The standard hormonal response to physical activity in healthy subjects without diabetes combines a reduction in circulating insulin concentrations , along with increased secretions of counter - regulatory hormones , including glucagon and epinephrine , among others ( see chapter 4 for further detail ) . In the contrary , in T1D this response is impeded , primarily by the fact that the organism cannot re - adapt insulin levels by physiological mechanisms ; hence complicating the management of exercise in T1D [ Hayes and Kriska , 2008 ] . However , any level of physical activity – i . e . from recreational to high - performance – can be practised by patients with T1D , provided that they are in good glycaemic control and do not suﬀer from severe complications . In this regard , physical activity is beneﬁcial for T1D patients in a number of aspects , including : overall physical ﬁtness and well - being , reduced risk and complications of car - diovascular diseases – whose impact is otherwise exacerbated in T1D – , and lower insulin 19 3 . 5 . Treatment of T1D resistance [ Chimen et al . , 2012 ] . However , various studies [ Kennedy et al . , 2013 ; Chimen et al . , 2012 ; Wallymahmed et al . , 2007 ; Herbst et al . , 2006 ] showed that overall glycaemic control ( measured through glycated haemoglobin A 1c ) did not experience signiﬁcant im - provements with exercise plans in T1D ; oppositely to the case of T2D , where scientiﬁc evidence is solid [ Chimen et al . , 2012 ] . Various reasons have been hypothesized to explain this lack of HbA 1c improvement in T1D , including reductions in insulin doses and aug - mented caloric intakes by patients – either as an additional energy source , or to protect against eventual exercise - induced hypoglycaemia episodes [ Kennedy et al . , 2013 ] – . How - ever , a recent meta - analysis by Kennedy et al . [ 2013 ] found beneﬁcial eﬀects in terms of glycaemic control for a subgroup of studies focused on young subject exercising during longer periods . Authors also suggested that longer interventions could potentially have more positive impacts on HbA 1c . In summary , there is not suﬃciently conclusive scientiﬁc evidence to consider exercise as a primary mechanism to improve glycaemic control in T1D . Instead , it constitutes a positive behaviour with valuable health beneﬁts for patients in other aspects , such as improved insulin sensitivity and protection against cardiovascular damage . According to current standards of medical care by the American Diabetes Association [ 2014 ] , general exercise recommendations ( i . e . non - T1D - speciﬁc ) are exactly the same than for the rest of the adult population : at least 150 min per week of moderate intensity exercise – corresponding to 50 – 70 % of each subject’s maximal heart rate ) , performed over at least three diﬀerent days ; or conversely , 75 min of vigorous activity per week . Speciﬁc ADA recommendations for exercising with T1D include [ American Diabetes Association , 2004 ] : • To arrange a medical evaluation before adhering to an activity routine . In case of pre - existing complications ( e . g . cardiovascular problems or neuropathies ) , exercise may be counter - indicated . • As for the general population , to involve in stretching , warm - up and cool - down ex - ercises for 5 – 10 min each ; both before and after the physical activity session . In this manner , muscles and the cardiorespiratory system are subject to a progressive increase / decrease of exercise intensity . • To maintain tight metabolic control before physical activity . In particular , not to ex - ercise if glycaemia at start is above 250 mg / dL ( 13 . 9 mmol / L ) with ketosis ; or to ex - ercise with caution if above 300 mg / dL ( 16 . 7 mmol / L ) but without ketosis . To ingest supplementary carbohydrates ( CHO ) if glycaemia is below 100 mg / dL ( 5 . 6 mmol / L ) . • To self - monitor blood glucose regularly in order to check that safety margins are not surpassed , or to take corrective therapeutic actions in accordance . In addition , the self - monitoring of glucose should be continued before , during and also after the exer - cise session in order to learn one’s response to diﬀerent activity types and conditions . • To consume rapid - absorption rescue CHO if needed to avoid hypoglycaemia . These rescue CHO must be available at all time during and after the practise of exercise . • Abundant hydration . 3 . 5 . 2 Experimental treatments As outlined above , T1D therapies in current clinical practise rely mainly on the admin - istration of exogenous insulin , along with diabetologic education to empower patient’s self - monitoring ( e . g . regular glucose measurement ) , action and decision - making . In the short - term future , it is expected that insulin will continue to be the main treatment for 20 3 . Diabetes the majority of cases ; whereas in the long - term , it will probably complement other thera - pies [ van Belle et al . , 2011 ] . In this regard , diﬀerent families of innovative approaches are currently under development , including [ O’Brien , 2013 ] : • Immunological therapies , either antigen - speciﬁc or not . • Gene therapies . • Compensations of the destruction of β - cell mass : islet transplantation and / or regen - eration , β - cell neogenesis or stem cell transplantation . • Artiﬁcial pancreas systems . 3 . 5 . 2 . 1 Immunological therapies Research concerning immunological therapies is focused on two principal aspects : a ) pro - moting tolerance to β - cell antigens , and b ) blocking the misguided autoimmune destruction of β - cell mass without weakening the overall immune response due to long - term immuno - suppression . However , various issues remain unresolved ; e . g . negative eﬀects on regulatory T - cells ( T - lymphocytes ) [ van Belle et al . , 2011 ] . Combinations of antigen - speciﬁc treatments with non - speciﬁc approaches ( e . g . anti - inﬂammatory agents ) are currently under development . It is also presumed that immune therapy will play an important role in combination with transplantations and regenerative therapies , in order to prevent the new β - cells from being destroyed again [ van Belle et al . , 2011 ] . 3 . 5 . 2 . 2 Gene therapies The core idea of gene therapy when applied in T1D consists in promoting the production of insulin by other cells instead of β - cells ; a task for which hepatocytes in the liver are frequently selected due to their sensitivity to glucose . For example , Callejas et al . [ 2013 ] used an adeno - associated viral vector to over - express the genes for insulin and glucokinase in the skeletal muscles of a canine model , resulting in a signiﬁcant increase of glucose uptake and a correction of hyperglycaemia which was sustained in the long - term : beyond four years . 3 . 5 . 2 . 3 Compensation of β - cell destruction This family of experimental therapies seek to compensate for the drastic reduction of β - cell mass , in turn restoring the ability to produce endogenous insulin . Diﬀerent approaches exist [ van Belle et al . , 2011 ] : • Stimulation of the remaining β - cells to promote insulin secretion , utilizing analogues of the incretin hormone GLP - 1 . • Neogenesis of β - cells , promoted by gastrin . • Islet regeneration from progenitor cells in the pancreas . This regeneration is induced by islet neogenesis associated protein ( INGAP ) peptide , in a similar manner as during embryonic stage . An extra advantage of this technique resides in that it does not require surgery . • Transplantation of islets of Langerhans from multiple donors , as in the Edmonton protocol [ Shapiro et al . , 2000 ] . This type of experiences show satisfactory results during the ﬁrst year after transplantation , although outcomes worsen in the long - term : despite immune suppression , after ﬁve years less than 10 % of patients remained 21 3 . 5 . Treatment of T1D insulin independent [ Ryan et al . , 2005 ] . Auto - reactions against the implanted cells notably reduced β - cell functionality . As a consequence , these islets transplantations are nowadays an option for speciﬁc groups of patients with the most aggravated cases : severe glycaemic liability , recurrent hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemia unawareness [ de Kort et al . , 2010 ] . The limited number of donors is also an important barrier , since two or three islet infusions from diﬀerent donors are usually required ; although research eﬀorts have been conduced with a single donor [ Hering , 2005 ] . • Transplantation of stem cells to regenerate β - cell mass , achieved either by : a ) the diﬀerentiation of embryonic or pluripotent stem cells ; or b ) by reprogramming of adult stem cells from their initial phenotype into β - like cells . Either transplanted or newly generated β - cells continue to provide antigens which are sus - ceptible to autoimmune attacks [ von Herrath et al . , 2007 ] ; whereas islet transplantations and allogeneic stem cells must also face alloimmune responses . In this sense , research is being conduced in the encapsulation of β - cells to create a physical barrier against immuno - logical responses , while allowing the β - cell to sense glucose and to release insulin as needed [ McGarrigle and Oberholzer , 2013 ] . This micro - encapsulation would reduce the need for immune suppression , although problems arise due to the limited amount of oxygen capable of crossing the barrier , an issue which compromises the energy supply to the cell . 3 . 5 . 2 . 4 Artiﬁcial pancreas Additionally to the biology - focused experimental therapies for T1D listed above , ‘artiﬁcial pancreas’ solutions constitute a technological approach to aid in the daily management of this chronic disease . Artiﬁcial pancreas systems – also frequently known as closed - loop glucose controllers – rely on the combination of three elements : a ) a continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) to regularly sense glucose levels , b ) an insulin pump to deliver micro - doses of insulin in real time , and c ) a control algorithm which , taking into account CGM glucose measurements and previous insulin administrations ( plus ideally other circumstances , such as meals or physical activity ) , suggests suitable insulin infusion regimes to maintain glucose concentration stable in safe levels . Thus , the automatic adaptations of therapy as proposed by the controller would assist – or eventually replace – constant human decision making while preserving patients’ health and safety . In - hospital glucose control has been available since the 1970s using the intravenous route for both glucose measurement and insulin infusion [ Clemens et al . , 1977 ] ; whereas on the contrary , ambulatory systems are still under development and demanding intense research eﬀorts . A major reason for this lies in the fact that practical aspects in ambulatory scenarios void the use of the intravenous route , forcing subcutaneous accesses instead . However , this subcutaneous route introduces considerable delays for glucose measurement , as well as for insulin absorption and action [ Cobelli et al . , 2011 ] . In practise , such cumulative delays pose a major challenge for the control algorithms which form the core of the artiﬁcial pancreas . As a consequence , the introduction of these systems into clinical practice is expected to oc - cur gradually [ Hovorka , 2011 ] . More restrained scenarios – in particular , overnight control – are being addressed ﬁrst , for a subsequent advance towards more complex and variable sit - uations , such as : a ) the control of prandial and postprandial periods – probably requiring manual meal announcement by the patient – , or b ) exercise [ Chassin et al . , 2007 ; Breton , 2008 ; Hovorka , 2011 ; van Bon et al . , 2011 ] . 22 3 . Diabetes In this regard , the main barriers for the consolidation of artiﬁcial pancreas solutions are currently [ Hovorka , 2011 ] : • To improve CGM technology , increasing its accuracy – which is yet lower than for glu - cose meters [ Hirsch , 2009 ] – as well as reducing its time lags and long - term deviations ( e . g . drifts ) . • The relatively slow absorption of insulin through the subcutaneous route , aggravated by inter - and intra - subject variabilities in pharmacokinetics . • The need for more advanced control algorithms capable of accommodating the men - tioned limitations : sensor inaccuracies , delays in glucose measurement and insulin action , as well as inter - and intra - subject variations and other physiological aspects of glucose homoeostasis . The two most widespread families control architectures applied to artiﬁcial pancreas situa - tions are proportional - integral - derivative ( PID ) [ Marchetti et al . , 2008 ] and model - predictive control ( MPC ) [ Hovorka et al . , 2004 ] ; although others exist in literature , e . g . based on fuzzy logic [ Atlas et al . , 2010 ] , on robust control theory H ∞ [ Kovács and Paláncz , 2007 ] , or rule - based approaches [ Wang et al . , 2010 ; Capel et al . , 2014 ] . PID is a generic feedback control mechanism governed by three weighted components ( namely : error with respect to tar - get , its derivative and its integral ) ; whereas MPC relies on a model – normally grounded on physiological descriptions , although not necessarily – to assess the glycaemic response to diﬀerent candidate insulin actions . In this sense , further research work is needed in the context of MPC controllers to enhance the supporting models so that they better re - ﬂect major events inﬂuencing glucose - insulin dynamics , mainly meals and exercise [ Chassin et al . , 2007 ; Breton , 2008 ; Breton et al . , 2014 ; Danne et al . , 2014 ] . In addition , artiﬁcial pancreas solutions have been proposed to compensate for the glucose - lowering eﬀects of excessive insulin administrations by means of the delivery of glucose - rising glucagon hormone [ El - Khatib et al . , 2007 , 2009 , 2010 ] , with the aim to take corrective actions to prevent hypoglycaemia events . Furthermore , telemedicine can be an advanta - geous complement to the basic behaviour of artiﬁcial pancreas systems , enhancing their safety and facilitating clinical supervision if necessary [ Gómez et al . , 2008 ; de Leiva and Hernando , 2009 ; Hovorka , 2011 ] . 23 3 . 5 . Treatment of T1D 24 Chapter 4 Physical activity in T1D 4 . 1 Foundations of exercise physiology This chapter overviews the main physiological mechanisms involved in the metabolic regu - lation of glucose during exercise , in the ﬁrst place for healthy subjects with diabetes . Later on , speciﬁcities for T1D patients are addressed . An important note should be made when discussing physiological eﬀects of physical activity : exercise intensity should not be referred by external criteria ( e . g . by means of running speed in km / h ) . Instead , for the sake of comparability , intensity should ideally be expressed as a percentage of each subject’s maximum oxygen uptake ( VO 2max ) ; where this VO 2max upper bound is dependent on several individual factors , including age and sex , height and weight , training status or genetic factors [ Nagi , 2006 ] . 4 . 1 . 1 Glucose homoeostasis at rest The brain and central nervous system ( CNS ) demand a constant glucose supply which represents around one half of the body’s total daily needs in terms of glucose [ Shrayyef and Gerich , 2009 ] . Besides , brain and CNS have the distinctive feature of utilizing circulating blood glucose without the need for insulin ; whereas on the contrary , other tissues ( e . g . skeletal and cardiac muscles ) require insulin in order to make glucose reach the interior of the cell . With this aim , glucose transporters are mobilized towards the cell membrane , facilitating in this manner the transit through the membrane . In the interior of the cell glucose serves as energy source via a degradation process named glycolysis . Meals are the primary external source of glucose and any amounts of meal glucose exceeding the basic , instantaneous requirements must be stored for future use . To do so , glucose undergoes a process of combination denominated glycogenesis to form larger molecules – glycogen – , which are in turn stored in the liver and in skeletal muscle [ Shrayyef and Gerich , 2009 ] . Conversely , in situations where extra energy is demanded , glycogen is mobilized from these storages and broken down again into glucose – glycogenolysis process – . On the other hand , once glycogen depots are already full , glucose is transformed ﬁrst into free fatty acids ( FFA ) and then into triglycerides , for storage in adipose tissue . Similarly , this process can be reversed – lipolysis – to carry out a combustion of FFA , from which energy is obtained ; as well as ketone bodies as a by - product [ Shrayyef and Gerich , 2009 ] . In addition , gluconeogenesis – mainly hepatic , and to a lesser extent renal – also plays a role for the maintenance of blood glucose concentrations in normal levels : it is the metabolic 25 4 . 1 . Foundations of exercise physiology pathway responsible for generating glucose from non - CHO substrates such as glycerol , pyruvate , lactate and glucogenic amino - acids [ Shrayyef and Gerich , 2009 ] . 4 . 1 . 2 Energy sources during exercise Physiological responses to exercise depend largely on the metabolic mechanisms employed to satisfy the additional energy demands for muscle contraction . In turn , the contributions of diﬀerent metabolic pathways depend strongly on the type , intensity and duration of physical activity ; as well as on the subject’s training and nutritional status . In T1D , additional aspects have an important role ( see section 4 . 2 ) . The unique process through which muscles can obtain energy for contraction is via the breakdown of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) into adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and phos - phate , with the subsequent release of energy ( Figure 4 . 1 ) . However , muscle cells are capable of storing only small amounts of ATP ready for its use , stores which may last for approxi - mately one second , at most [ Colberg , 2009 ] . Consequently , external mechanisms are needed to externally provide muscles with ATP . Three metabolic pathways exist : i ) phosphagen , ii ) lactic acid , and iii ) aerobic systems . These three mechanisms work as a continuum , which implies that all of them are used to some extent for almost any exercise lasting for more than one minute ( Figure 4 . 5 ) [ Colberg , 2009 ] . 4 . 1 . 2 . 1 ATP - CP system The ATP - CP pathway – also known as phosphagen system – is almost exclusively involved in very short and explosive activities which demand high power , e . g . short sprinting or a power lift . Posphagen – i . e . creatine phosphate ( CP ) – cannot fuel muscular activity in a direct manner , but the rapid energy release obtained from its breakdown serves to resynthesize ATP via the phosphorilation of ADP ( Figure 4 . 2 ) . Given that this process can operate during around 5 to 9 extra seconds after the initial depletion of ATP which occurred in the ﬁrst second , the ATP - CP energy source cannot be sustained beyond 10 s [ Colberg , 2009 ] . Since oxygen is not required for the ATP - CP metabolic pathway , it is said to be anaerobic . Besides , blood glucose is not involved , meaning that glucose decays should not occur for T1D . On the contrary , the exacerbated release of glucose - rising counter - regulatory hor - mones may lead to a rise in glycaemia [ Colberg , 2009 ] ( see section 4 . 2 ) . 4 . 1 . 2 . 2 Lactic acid system The so - called ‘lactic acid’ system contributes mainly to activities whose duration ranges from approximately 10 s to 2 min , e . g . an 800 m athletics race . Essentially , this pathway is predominant ( Figure 4 . 5 ) when the ATP - CP system is already depleted and the intensity of exercise demands high energy supplies which the aerobic system alone cannot match . Muscle glycogen stored in the involved skeletal muscles is broken down by glycogenolysis . Once released , glycogen produces energy through the metabolic process of glycolysis ; in particular via fast anaerobic glycolysis , which generates ATP plus lactate as by - product ( Figure 4 . 3 ) . In this regard and despite the ( misleading ) traditional name of the system , at biological pH levels it is – not lactic acid – as well as H + hydrogen ions which are released [ Nagi , 2006 ] . At rest , the aerobic processing of CHO produces modest amounts of lactate ; 26 4 . Physical activity in T1D whereas on the contrary , fast anaerobic glycolysis generates much larger quantities which lead to lowered pH in muscle and blood , linked to the appearance of muscular fatigue . Similarly to ATP - CP , the lactic acid system is an anaerobic mechanism not demanding O 2 . Its main advantage resides in its rapid energy contribution , although the use of glucose is notably ineﬃcient : one molecule of glucose can only produce 3 ATP through anaerobic glycolysis , in contrast to as many as 37 – 39 ATP via the aerobic procedure [ Colberg , 2009 ] . 4 . 1 . 2 . 3 Aerobic system The aerobic contribution is prevailing in prolonged physical activities – e . g . endurance running – because it can provide a steady supply of energy for sustained activities lasting for more than 2 min . This metabolic pathway relies on the aerobic ( i . e . O 2 - based ) metabolism of glucose and FFA , along with the breakdown of liver and muscle glycogen ( Figure 4 . 4 ) . At rest the main source of energy is fat , contributing with around 60 % of energy ; whereas CHO provides almost the remaining 40 % . Nonetheless , there is also a minor contribution from protein – below 5 % – , except in very prolonged and demanding exercises where this fuel may reach up to 15 % [ Nagi , 2006 ; Colberg , 2009 ] . Anyhow , the exact mix of fuels depends on several factors such as : physical activity’s intensity and duration , diet pre - and during exercise , subject’s training status and – in the case of patients with T1D – circulating plasma insulin concentrations . When exercising , the proportion of energy extracted from CHOs increases with intensity , reaching up to almost 100 % in near - maximal exertions . This phenomenon occurs because the extraction of ATP and energy from CHOs is more eﬃcient than from fat . As a conse - quence , CHOs – rather than blood glucose – are the major source of glucose for the muscles , accounting for approximately 80 % of energy [ Colberg , 2009 ] . On the other hand , during less intense activity adrenaline hormone mobilizes fat from adipocytes – i . e . fat cells – , that circulate in blood as FFA for exercising muscles to take up . Hence , during milder activity muscles use mainly fat as well as some CHOs . With training , body’s capacity to mobi - lize and to metabolize fats is enhanced , which means that the energy supply becomes less reliant on glucose and that the rates of depletion of muscle glycogen are lower [ Colberg , 2009 ] . 4 . 2 Exercise physiology in T1D In subjects without diabetes , the normal physiological response to exercise induces a de - crease in plasma insulin levels plus an extra secretion of glucagon to stimulate the liver to produce additional glucose via hepatic glycogenolysis [ Colberg , 2009 ] . Additional glucose - rising counter - regulatory hormones are also released , namely : catecholamines ( epinephrine , norepinephrine ) , cortisol and growth hormone ( Table 4 . 1 ) . On the other hand and in spite of the lowered insulin levels , muscles continue to take up glucose because contractions stim - ulate the translocation of glucose transporters to the cell membrane [ Thorell et al . , 1999 ] . Finally , glycogen stores in muscles and liver are replenished after exercise . The main diﬀerences in T1D stem from the fact that such a normal endocrine response is lost [ Lumb and Gallen , 2009 ] , as the physiological decrease in insulin cannot be mimicked due to the subject’s hindered capability to regulate the amounts of circulating insulin in real time . With MDI , the adjustment of exogenous dosages requires previous planning ; whereas in comparison , some extra ﬂexibility is gained with CSII , e . g . by stopping the 27 4 . 2 .

Physical activity in T1D pump at the onset of physical activity . As described below , insulin levels during exercise ( Table 4 . 2 ) play an essential role in determining the T1D response to exercise [ Wasserman and Zinman , 1994 ] : Overinsulinization High insulin concentrations may occur for various reasons . For example , bolus doses es - timated in account for sedentary situations may in turn result excessive in the event of unscheduled physical activity sessions . Alternatively , overinsulinization may also be due to exercise - induced rises in insulin absorption and / or action . In turn , excessive levels of circulating insulin may reduce severely – or even inhibit – [ Wasser - man and Zinman , 1994 ] the secretion of glucagon and the other counter - regulatory hor - mones , a phenomenon leading to attenuated releases of hepatic glucose . In addition , the scarcity of adrenaline hormone can impair the release of FFA from adipose tissue via lipol - ysis , which would translate to lesser amounts of fat as alternative fuel for contracting muscles . Furthermore , high insulin levels promote an accelerated uptake of glucose from the blood stream [ Wasserman and Zinman , 1994 ] . Therefore , all these events – in combi - nation with the extra glucose consumptions caused by muscular work – pose a high risk of hypoglycaemia . To tackle this problem , compensatory reductions of insulin dosage would be desirable . How - ever , and particularly if MDI therapy is used , this requires the patient to schedule his / her exercise session in advance , as well as taking into account the foreseen timing and inten - sity of exercise in order to calculate suitable bolus dosages . Since this pre - compensatory strategy is not always feasible ( e . g . for spontaneous activities ) , subjects may need to ingest extra CHOs to prevent hypoglycaemias [ Gallen , 2014 ] . Underinsulinization Underinsulinization is often linked to poor diabetologic control and sustained hypergly - caemia [ Wasserman and Zinman , 1994 ] . If physical activity is performed under these cir - cumstances , it may worsen metabolic control : exacerbating hyperglycaemia and ketosis . With low plasma insulin levels , the expected exercise - induced increase in glucose utiliza - tion may be impaired [ Wasserman and Zinman , 1994 ] . This issue , along with : a ) the physiologically normal rise in endogenous hepatic glucose production , and b ) an exacer - bated glucagon response , often lead to increased glycaemia levels . In addition , lipolysis may generate excessive ketone bodies . On the other hand , patients with poor metabolic control usually show an elevated response in terms of the release of counter - regulatory glucose - rising hormones [ Wasserman and Zin - man , 1994 ] . In summary ( Table 4 . 2 ) : excessive insulin concentrations during physical activity impair – or block – substrate mobilization , leading to hypoglycaemia ; whereas insuﬃcient insulin , in association with an exacerbated release of glucose - rising counter - regulatory hormones , may cause hyperglycaemia and ketosis . Besides , apart from insulin concentration , various other variables inﬂuence the glycaemic response to exercise in T1D , which can be divided in broad terms into two groups : 29 4 . 2 . Exercise physiology in T1D Hormone Released by Eﬀects Glucagon Pancreas It stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis from precursors . It also has a large eﬀect in the increase of glucose release . Epinephrine ( adrenaline ) Adrenal medulla It stimulates muscle – and to a lesser extent , hepatic – glycogenolysis . It mobilizes FFA from adipose tissue . Nor - epinephrine ( nor - adrenaline ) Adrenal medulla It stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis from available precursors . Along with epinephrine , it exerts a ‘feed - forward’ control on glucose during intense exercise . Cortisol Adrenal cortex It stimulates the mobilization of amino - acids and glycerol as precursor for hepatic gluconeogenesis , along with the release of FFA for muscle use in lieu of glucose . Growth hormone Anterior pituitary It stimulates fat metabolism – i . e . the release of FFA from adipose tissue – and the storage of amino - acids , along with an indirect suppression of glucose use .

Plasma insulin Hepatic glucose production Muscle glucose uptake Trend in gly - caemia Risk Low ⇑⇑ ↑ ↑ or ⇑ Hyperglycaemia Normal ⇑⇑ ⇑⇑ → or ց Limited High ↑ ⇑⇑ ↓ or ⇓ Hypoglycaemia Table 4 . 2 : Expectable exercise - induced trends in glycaemia for T1D patients under diﬀerent conditions in terms of insulinaemia ( Source : Adapted from Colberg [ 2009 ] ) . • Factors in common with the general population : intensity , duration and type of physical activity , individual ﬁtness level , nutritional status and previous meals ( both in terms of their content and their timing with respect to the exercixe bout ) . • Speciﬁc for T1D : timing of last insulin injections and type of preparations used , their absorption rates , overall metabolic control or diabetes complications , among others . Given the number and diversity of factors , it is diﬃcult to provide precise instructions on how to manage exercise in T1D ; although general therapeutic guidelines are available in literature [ American Diabetes Association , 2004 ; Riddell and Perkins , 2006 ; Lumb and Gallen , 2009 ; Gallen , 2014 ] . Training diminishes the release of glucose - rising hormones . It also augments subject’s ca - pacity to mobilize and metabolize fats , which in turn reduces the reliance on glucose as fuel and leads to slower depletions of muscle glycogen . As a consequence , reductions in insulin dosage in order to accommodate exercise do not need to be so drastic as for untrained individuals . In addition , training enhances insulin eﬃciency because glucose is more easily taken up by muscles . All these aspects combined translate generally into lower daily insulin requirements , as well as into easier metabolic control . 30 4 . Physical activity in T1D Anyway , hypoglycaemia continues to be the most prominent risk for T1D patients who practise physical activity . In this regard , hypoglycaemia events may not only occur during exercise but also afterwards ( even up to 12 – 14 h later , specially in nocturnal periods [ Nagi , 2006 ] ) . Possible mechanisms in charge for this delayed phenomenon are : a ) an attenuation of the endogenous glucose production [ Gallen , 2014 ] . b ) a prolonged increase in insulin sensitivity caused by exercise [ Sonnenberg et al . , 1990 ] , and c ) the delayed replenishment of hepatic glycogen stores . An added problem with hypoglycaemia events occurred within the day previous to a certain exertion is that these episodes augment the risk of another hypoglycaemia [ Briscoe et al . , 2007 ] . Besides , hypoglycaemia during physical activity may be diﬃcult to detect [ Riddell and Burr , 2011 ] , in part because many of its symptoms ( e . g . tiredness , sweating ) are normal sensations in exercise . Furthermore , the activation of counter - regulatory hormones – which would normally contribute to the restoration of glucose levels – may be reduced or absent [ Cryer , 2009 ] . With respect to diﬀerent physical activity modalities , continuous exercise of moderate in - tensity is generally associated with a greater risk of hypoglycaemia in T1D [ Ertl and Davis , 2004 ] . Conversely , very intense physical activity ( above 80 % VO 2max ) , as well as anaerobic exercise of short duration ( where glucose uptake by muscles is low ) can lead to hypergly - caemia [ Marliss and Vranic , 2002 ] due to the release of large amounts of catecholamines , cortisol and growth hormone [ Purdon et al . , 1993 ; Gallen , 2014 ] . Furthermore , the im - possibility of a physiological rise in endogenous insulin secretion during recovery – which in non - T1D subjects leads to a normalization of glucose levels – can result in prolonged hyperglycaemia [ Chu et al . , 2011 ] , a situation for which speciﬁc therapeutic guidelines are required [ Riddell and Perkins , 2006 ; Lumb and Gallen , 2009 ] . On the other hand , inter - mittent high - intensity exercise ( IHE ) may be associated with lower rates of hypoglycaemia [ Guelﬁ et al . , 2007 ] as compared to moderate intensity exercise . The glycaemic response to IHE ( which is prototypical of team sports , for example ) depends on the balance between : a ) its part with a sustained – predominantly aerobic – exertion , and b ) the proportion of interspersed , short but intense bursts – with notable anaerobic contributions – . Nonetheless , this balance is diﬃcult to ascertain in free - living conditions ( e . g . recreational sports ) [ Basu et al . , 2014 ] . Finally , resistance exercise – e . g . strength / weight training – was reported not to alter insulin sensitivity after the performance of exercise [ Jiménez et al . , 2009 ] , which may diminish the occurrence of post - exercise hypoglycaemia in T1D with respect to sustained aerobic activity . 4 . 3 Systematic review : Quantiﬁcation of the acute ef - fect of exercise on glycaemia in T1D 4 . 3 . 1 Motivation As outlined qualitatively in the previous section , the physiological response to physical activity in T1D subjects depends on multiple factors , including : exercise type , duration and intensity ; amounts of prior CHO intakes and insulin administrations , along with their 31 4 . 3 . Systematic review : Quantiﬁcation of the acute eﬀect of exercise on glycaemia in T1D scheduling in relation to the onset of exercise ; plasma glucose and insulin levels , or cardio - vascular ﬁtness [ American Diabetes Association , 2004 ; Colberg , 2009 ; Nagi , 2006 ; Wasser - man and Zinman , 1994 ] . This considerable number of inﬂuential factors hinders the trans - lation of scientiﬁc evidences into exercise counselling , and most importantly , it complicates patients’ daily self - management of physical activity . In order to translate the qualitative physiological descriptions covered above into measur - able trends in glycaemia , various works in literature studied the impact that a range of protocols – encompassing diﬀerent exercise modalities – caused on T1D patients’ glucose levels , as well as on their temporal evolution trends . However , given the limited literature addressing the comparison of these eﬀects from a quantitative perspective , a systematic review and meta - analysis were conduced in the context of this PhD thesis work . Available studies were pooled to synthesize the quantitative evidence for acute changes in glycaemia temporal proﬁles , as induced during structured exercise sessions and in their immediately subsequent recovery stage . Various modalities of physical activity were considered in or - der to ascertain diﬀerences among them . Analyses were carried out on the basis of novel rate - of - change magnitudes to summarize variations with exercise time . 4 . 3 . 2 Methodology This systematic review and meta - analysis was elaborated following current methodological guidelines on the conduct of systematic reviews for randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) as suggested by the PRISMA statement [ Moher et al . , 2009 ] and Cochrane Handbook [ Higgins and Green , 2011 ] . 4 . 3 . 2 . 1 Eligibility criteria Eligible studies enrolled human subjects with T1D , regardless of their age or duration of diabetes . Only acute interventions consisting of a standardized exercise protocol with con - trolled intensity and timing were considered ; therefore , exercise in free - living conditions and / or prolonged training programs were excluded . Given that the main outcome of inter - est here was the acute change in glycaemia proﬁles , eligible studies were required to provide measurements reﬂecting how glucose concentrations evolved over time : from the start of the exercise session until its cessation , and preferably also for a period immediately afterwards ( early recovery stage ) . In a ﬁrst iteration of this review , the search was restricted by study design to incorporate RCTs only . However , since all of the primarily eligible trials had a crossover design , non - randomized experiments ( NREs ) were also allowed ; these NRE being controlled trials in which the allocation procedure ( order of treatments / interventions ) was not random as in RCT . Within - trial comparisons for the main eﬀect of physical activity on glycaemia were established , either against a control resting period or with respect to proﬁles from another type of exercise ( this depending on the particular design of each study ) . 4 . 3 . 2 . 2 Study identiﬁcation and selection Candidate studies were searched using PubMed , ISI Web of Knowledge’s MEDLINE , Sco - pus and the Cochrane Library on - line databases . Last update of the search was conduced in November 2013 . In a ﬁrst pass , no publication date restriction was set , but due to the diﬃ - culty in retrieving full texts of older articles , it was decided to limit the range to year 1992 or later . Search terms included type 1 diabetes mellitus , blood glucose , physical activity and 32 4 . Physical activity in T1D exercise ; as well as their corresponding medical subject headings ( MeSH ) equivalent terms [ Coletti and Bleich , 2001 ] . These MeSH synonyms were available for PubMed , MEDLINE and Cochrane search engines , but not for Scopus . Publications were ﬁrst screened on the basis of their titles and abstracts . Subsequently , full contents of candidate papers were examined in depth for a deﬁnitive selection . 4 . 3 . 2 . 3 Data extraction The main characteristics of the selected studies were recorded , namely : study design , pop - ulation data ( e . g . number , sex , age or duration of diabetes ) and full description of the pro - posed exercise session ( type , duration and intensity ) , plus the planned food intake and / or insulin interventions . To enable analyses independent of the speciﬁc exercise protocol used in each study – particularly , independent of its session duration – ; instead of focusing on the total glucose change in absolute terms , a rate - of - change ( RoC ) magnitude RoC E was deﬁned here as the excursion in glucose levels measured during exercise , divided by the time span of the bout : RoC E = g E − g 0 t E = ∆ g OE t E ( 4 . 1 ) where : a ) glycaemia measurements are doneted by g ’s variables , b ) ∆ g OE = g E − g 0 is the glycaemic excursion from g O ( glycaemia at the onset of the activity ) to g E ( glycaemia at the end of the exertion ) , and c ) t E is the duration of such exercise session ( Figure 4 . 6 ) . To characterize the trend of variation in glycaemia observed for the early recovery stage – i . e . immediately after exercise termination – , a similar RoC R magnitude was also proposed : RoC R = g R − g E t R = ∆ g ER t R ( 4 . 2 ) where : a ) ∆ g ER = g R − g E is the excursion from g E to g R ( glycaemia at the end of the early recovery period ) , and b ) t R is the duration of the recovery interval . For the purpose of this review , t R was set equal to 30 min post - exercise . Given the deﬁnitions of these two RoC magnitudes in ( 4 . 1 ) – ( 4 . 2 ) , it is straightforward that their means – denoted here by the operator m ( · ) – can be calculated as follows : m ( RoC E ) = 1 t E [ m ( g E ) − m ( g O ) ] ( 4 . 3 ) m ( RoC R ) = 1 t R [ m ( g R ) − m ( g E ) ] ( 4 . 4 ) or equivalently , for those studies reporting glycaemia proﬁles as increments from a baseline value : m ( RoC E ) = 1 t E m ( ∆ g OE ) ( 4 . 5 ) m ( RoC R ) = 1 t R m ( ∆ g ER ) ( 4 . 6 ) 33 4 . 3 . Systematic review : Quantiﬁcation of the acute eﬀect of exercise on glycaemia in T1D For their standard deviations – denoted SD ( · ) – it can be derived by arithmetic operations that : SD ( RoC E ) = 1 t E q SD 2 ( g E ) + SD 2 ( g O ) − COV ( g O , g E ) ( 4 . 7 ) = 1 t E q SD 2 ( g E ) + SD 2 ( g O ) − ρ ( g O , g E ) SD ( g O ) SD ( g E ) ( 4 . 8 ) SD ( RoC R ) = 1 t R q SD 2 ( g R ) + SD 2 ( g E ) − COV ( g E , g R ) ( 4 . 9 ) = 1 t R q SD 2 ( g R ) + SD 2 ( g E ) − ρ ( g E , g R ) SD ( g E ) SD ( g R ) ( 4 . 10 ) where COV ( · , · ) represents covariance and ρ ( · , · ) is Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient : ρ XY = COV XY SD X SD Y ( 4 . 11 ) Eligible works from literature did not report any individualized proﬁles , aggregating them instead as mean population proﬁles . Consequently , direct information concerning the inter - subject statistical variability of RoCs could not be obtained . Hence , neither covariances COV ( · , · ) nor correlations ρ ( · , · ) could be calculated here . To circumvent this issue , gly - caemia values in both extremes of the respective intervals were assumed uncorrelated , i . e . : ρ ( g O , g E ) = 0 ( 4 . 12 ) ρ ( g E , g R ) = 0 ( 4 . 13 ) Thus , ( 4 . 8 ) , ( 4 . 10 ) reduce to : SD ( RoC E ) = 1 t E q SD 2 ( g E ) + SD 2 ( g O ) ( 4 . 14 ) SD ( RoC R ) = 1 t R q SD 2 ( g R ) + SD 2 ( g E ) ( 4 . 15 ) Since there are not previous works in literature following comparable approaches to the concept of RoCs as introduced in ( 4 . 1 ) – ( 4 . 2 ) , estimations about correlation coeﬃcients ρ were not available . The assumption of uncorrelated measurements used here , although perhaps simplistic , may provide a reasonable estimate for RoC values to be pooled in the meta - analysis ( and possibly conservative if in practice ρ were > 0 ) . 4 . 3 . 2 . 4 Statistical analysis In this analysis , three exercise modalities / types were distinguished : • Continuous physical activity ( CONT ) ; consisting in sustained exercise performed at moderate intensities , with a predominant aerobic component . • Intermittent high - intensity exercise ( IHE ) ; with moderate exercise interspersed with various short episodes of maximal or near - maximal intensity . • Resistance activity ( RESIST ) , such as weight lifting , with a remarkable anaerobic contribution . In ﬁrst place , comparisons were established for each of these three modalities versus a corresponding resting control period ( REST ) . To do so , a detrending procedure was carried out : the temporal variation observed in the glycaemic proﬁle at REST was subtracted at a 34 4 . Physical activity in T1D Figure 4 . 6 : Deﬁnition of RoC magnitudes during the performance of physical activity and in the immediately subsequent recovery period . RoCs approximate the average tempo - ral evolution of glycaemia , from one extreme of the interval to the other , by rectilinear segments . study level ( i . e . prior to the pooling ) . In this manner , background spurious trends – which may be present in the REST proﬁle due to factors other than exercise itself ( for example , caused by the particular experimental protocol in each study , e . g . by insulin administration strategies or pre - exercise CHO supplementations ) – were mitigated . Secondly , direct comparisons between pairs of exercise modalities were also performed wher - ever appropriate studies were available . CONT was selected here as the reference modality . Thus , diﬀerences with respect to the glycaemia proﬁle for CONT exercise were ﬁrst calcu - lated at a study level for the purpose of detrending , and subsequently pooled . DerSimonian & Laird random - eﬀects meta - analyses [ Higgins and Green , 2011 ] were used here to ascertain statistical diﬀerences in means of continuous outcomes ( RoCs ) , as available in RevMan software [ RevMan , 2012 ] . RoC E , RoC R values were pooled across studies and their heterogeneity assessed using the I 2 statistic [ Higgins and Green , 2011 ] . 4 . 3 . 2 . 5 Risk of bias To ascertain the validity of candidate publications , the main indicators for risk of bias in crossover studies [ Higgins and Green , 2011 ] were analysed : a ) Suitability of the crossover design b ) Randomness in the allocation of treatments c ) Presence or absence of carry - over eﬀects d ) Performing appropriate paired statistical analysis . In addition , publication bias across studies was assessed through funnel plots of mean diﬀerences , in order to check for possible asymmetries resulting from the non - publication of trials . 4 . 3 . 3 Results 4 . 3 . 3 . 1 Study characteristics The electronic search yielded 540 unique references ( Figure 4 . 7 ) , as well as 54 other items discarded due to the publication date criterion ( not shown in ﬁgure ) . After a preliminary 35 4 . 3 . Systematic review : Quantiﬁcation of the acute eﬀect of exercise on glycaemia in T1D screening , 148 out of those 540 references were considered potentially relevant based on their titles and abstracts . After evaluating full texts , another 131 studies were dismissed for not satisfying the pre - speciﬁed criteria to be included in the systematic review . The three most frequent reasons for exclusions ( Figure 4 . 7 ) were : a ) Observational and other non - RCT / NRE study designs ( e . g . case - controls ) , n = 34 b ) Studies which comprised a glucose clamp experiment to maintain glycaemia artiﬁ - cially stabilized during exercise , while measuring other metabolic phenomena ( e . g . to determine exercise - induced changes in peripheral insulin sensitivity ) , n = 24 c ) Studies which investigated the impact of auxiliary interventions apart from exercise itself ( e . g . modiﬁcations in insulin or diet supplements to accommodate exercise , or changes in session scheduling with respect to meals ) , n = 22 . Trial arms in these experiments were designed to ascertain the eﬀect of applying or not those auxiliary interventions : for example , to compare the diﬀerent impacts in glucose proﬁles be - tween exercising after hydration with an isotonic drink containing higher versus lower amounts of CHO [ Perrone et al . , 2005 ] . Thus , it would not have been possible to es - tablish a reference control proﬁle to cancel temporal background trends attributable to factors other than exercise . Out of the remaining 17 candidate articles , another 8 works were excluded from this meta - analysis due to three reasons identiﬁed post hoc , namely : i ) In ﬁve studies [ Dubé et al . , 2005 , 2006 , 2013 ; Yardley et al . , 2012 , 2013a ] , patients were supplied with rescue dextrose or CHO to avoid severe hypoglycaemia , which implied that glucose proﬁles were artiﬁcially altered by those emergency interventions ii ) Two studies [ Bussau et al . , 2006 , 2007 ] consisted of a single 10 - s sprint at the beginning or at the end of a session , and could not therefore be strictly considered to belong to either CONT or IHE modality iii ) One study [ Tsalikian et al . , 2005 ] did not provide any data about inter - subject vari - ability , only mean population proﬁles . An extra study [ Yardley et al . , 2013b ] was identiﬁed during the process of peer review for journal publication . Table 4 . 3 summarizes the main characteristics of the ten publications ﬁnally incorporated to this systematic review and meta - analysis . 4 . 3 . 3 . 2 Risk of bias Regarding the possible indicators for risk of bias for crossover studies listed in section 4 . 3 . 2 . 5 : a ) The comparison of results from studies with crossover design against parallel RCTs was not feasible here , since none of the latter were found in this literature review . b ) Randomization of treatment allocations : A total of 8 out of 10 publications had a crossover RCT design , where the chronological order of the experimental and the control trial arms was set randomly ( Table 4 . 3 ) . Yardley et al . [ 2013b ] did not com - ment explicitly on their randomization process for trial arms and as a consequence , random order could not be assumed ; whereas Yamanouchi et al . [ 2002 ] employed a NRE design with a ﬁxed order of the trial arms , an aspect which may have introduced a period eﬀect to some extent in this speciﬁc study . c ) Carry - over eﬀects : Table 4 . 3 contains a summary of the wash - out periods proposed in each study protocol , speciﬁed by authors in order to avoid – or at least to minimize – 36 4 .

Physical activity in T1D the presence of carry - over eﬀects between intervention arms . The majority studies required that physical exertions were at least one week apart , with some of them using shorter wash - outs , although never less than two days . Several researchers instructed participants to refrain from any physical activity in the 24 – 48 hours prior to the test [ Guelﬁ et al . , 2005b ; Iscoe and Riddell , 2011 ; Maran et al . , 2010 ] or alternatively , to maintain their usual lifestyle [ Soo et al . , 1996 ] . However , three publications did not clearly comment on preceding physical activity [ Rabasa - Lhoret et al . , 2001 ; Guelﬁ et al . , 2005a ; Yardley et al . , 2013b ] . On the other hand , three protocols [ Guelﬁ et al . , 2005b ; Maran et al . , 2010 ; Jankovec et al . , 2011 ] checked for the absence of hypogly - caemia events during the hours or days prior to the exercise sessions , postponing the study in the case of recent hypoglycaemia episodes . d ) Individually - paired statistical analyses were not feasible here , because the eligible papers reported only mean population proﬁles and not individual glycaemia proﬁles for each subject by separate . The resulting funnel plots ( Figure 4 . 8 ) did not show any evidence of asymmetry which may indicate publication bias . However , the number of studies under evaluation here was clearly insuﬃcient as to allow deﬁnitive conclusions to be drawn in this regard . 4 . 3 . 3 . 3 Synthesis of results and statistical analyses 4 . 3 . 3 . 3 . 1 Meta - analyses With respect to REST This ﬁrst form of meta - analysis consisted in taking REST as the reference activity – in this case , the absence of physical activity - . For each study ( i . e . at a study level , prior to the pooling ) , temporal changes reported during the time scheduled for exercise were detrended . This was achieved by subtracting the average temporal evolution ( i . e . RoC ) observed at the REST control period . Hence , given that REST was taken as reference : • Zero RoC E , RoC R values would mean that the exercise - induced trend in glycaemia could not be distinguished from the inherent proﬁle at REST , being identical . • Positive RoC E , RoC R values would reﬂect a stronger net tendency towards increasing glycaemia levels than in REST . This could be due to either slower decays , or faster increases ( the latter option normally during recovery periods , when glycaemia would be expectable to rise ) . • Conversely , negative RoC E , RoC R numbers would imply net trends to lower glycaemia than in the background REST case , either by faster decays or slower rises than in REST . There were seven studies [ Iscoe and Riddell , 2011 ; Jankovec et al . , 2011 ; Peter et al . , 2005 ; Rabasa - Lhoret et al . , 2001 ; Soo et al . , 1996 ; Yamanouchi et al . , 2002 ; Yardley et al . , 2013b ] comparing CONT and REST periods , with a total of eleven comparisons : • Soo et al . [ 1996 ] conduced separate interventions to investigate exercise after having ingested either simple or complex CHOs . Hence , that work embraced two compar - isons . • In Rabasa - Lhoret et al . [ 2001 ] three diﬀerent intensities were addressed : 25 , 50 and 75 % VO 2max . • In Yamanouchi et al . [ 2002 ] authors inspected two diﬀerent morning schedules for exercise : pre - and postprandial . 39 4 . 3 .

Horizontal axes represent the mean reported eﬀect in each study , i . e . mean values for RoC E ( panels in the left column ) or for RoC R ( right column ) ; whereas vertical axes depict their corresponding standard error ( SE ) . Panels a , b refer to the CONT vs . REST comparison , panels c , d to IHE vs . REST and e , f to RESIST vs . REST ; whereas panels g , h cover the IHE vs . CONT comparison and i , j RESIST vs . CONT . 40 4 . Physical activity in T1D Pooled results for the CONT versus REST comparison ( Figure 4 . 9 ) show that this con - tinuous exercise modality is on average associated with signiﬁcant reductions in glucose concentrations during the practise of exercise , when compared to the resting control ref - erence . It is also related to a slight rise after exercise cessation , which tended to mildly restore glucose levels during recovery . Quantitatively : • RoC E { CONT vs . REST } = − 4 . 43 mmol / L · h − 1 ( p < 0 . 00001 , 95 % conﬁdence interval ( CI ) [ − 6 . 06 , − 2 . 79 ] mmol / L · h − 1 ; I 2 = 41 % ) • RoC R { CONT vs . REST } = + 0 . 70 mmol / L · h − 1 ( p = 0 . 46 , 95 % CI [ − 1 . 14 , + 2 . 54 ] mmol / L · h − 1 ; I 2 = 0 % ) . Results for the IHE versus REST comparison ( Figure 4 . 10 ) also reﬂect a pronounced fall in glycaemia during physical activity , along with recovery trends which were positive with respect to the resting proﬁles , although not statistically signiﬁcant so : • RoC E { IHE vs . REST } = − 5 . 25 mmol / L · h − 1 ( p < 0 . 00001 , 95 % CI [ − 7 . 02 , − 3 . 48 ] mmol / L · h − 1 ; I 2 = 0 % ) when aggregating the two relevant studies [ Guelﬁ et al . , 2005a ; Iscoe and Riddell , 2011 ] • RoC R { IHE vs . REST } = + 0 . 72 mmol / L · h − 1 ( p = 0 . 71 , 95 % CI [ − 3 . 10 , + 4 . 54 ] mmol / L · h − 1 ; I 2 = 0 % ) . For the RESIST versus REST case ( Figure 4 . 11 ) , only one study [ Yardley et al . , 2013b ] covered this comparison . Outcomes were : • RoC E { RESIST vs . REST } = − 2 . 61 mmol / L · h − 1 ( p = 0 . 30 , 95 % CI [ − 7 . 55 , + 2 . 34 ] mmol / L · h − 1 ; I 2 not applicable ) • RoC R { RESIST vs . REST } = − 0 . 02 mmol / L · h − 1 ( p = 1 . 00 , 95 % CI [ − 7 . 58 , + 7 . 53 ] mmol / L · h − 1 ; I 2 not applicable ) . Between exercise modalities Whenever possible , the direct comparison between pairs of exercise modalities was also addressed . However , given the relative scarcity of eligible studies , this was feasible in only two scenarios , namely : with CONT and IHE ( based on three studies [ Guelﬁ et al . , 2005b ; Maran et al . , 2010 ; Iscoe and Riddell , 2011 ] ) , as well as with CONT and RESIST [ Yardley et al . , 2013b ] . Hence , CONT was established as the common reference modality for comparison purposes . Consequently , negative RoC values signify more pronounced decays in glycaemia – or milder increases – than in the corresponding CONT reference period , whereas positive RoCs reﬂect either slower decreases or faster rises than during CONT . For the IHE versus CONT comparison ( Figure 4 . 12 ) , decays in glycaemia during exercise were observed to occur more slowly in the case of IHE , as revealed by a positive RoC E value . On the other hand , RoC R values were similar : • RoC E { IHE vs . CONT } = + 1 . 57 mmol / L · h − 1 ( p = 0 . 15 , 95 % CI [ − 0 . 59 , + 3 . 73 ] mmol / L · h − 1 ; I 2 = 53 % ) • RoC R { IHE vs . CONT } = + 0 . 37 mmol / L · h − 1 ( p = 0 . 83 , 95 % CI [ − 2 . 90 , + 3 . 63 ] mmol / L · h − 1 ; I 2 = 0 % ) . Figure 4 . 13 based on Yardley et al . [ 2013b ] revealed a milder decrease of glycaemia in RESIST exercise with respect to CONT , as well as a slower recovery : • RoC E { RESIST vs . CONT } = + 2 . 86 mmol / L · h − 1 ( p = 0 . 20 , 95 % CI [ − 1 . 49 , + 7 . 20 ] mmol / L · h − 1 ; I 2 not applicable ) • RoC R { RESIST vs . CONT } = − 2 . 40 mmol / L · h − 1 ( p = 0 . 39 , 95 % CI [ − 7 . 87 , + 3 . 06 ] mmol / L · h − 1 ; I 2 not applicable ) 41 4 . 3 .

Physical activity in T1D Of note Yardley et al . [ 2013b ] documented negligible ﬂuctuations for glycaemia during the RESIST recovery stage ( when viewed in absolute terms ) , along with positive recoveries in CONT . 4 . 3 . 3 . 3 . 2 Meta - regression To ascertain the dose / response relationship with varying exercise intensities in terms of resulting RoC values , a post hoc random - eﬀect meta - regression analysis was carried out us - ing ‘metareg’ package in Stata 13 software ( StataCorp LP ; College Station , Texas , USA ) . Given the reduced number of studies , this was only feasible for the comparison of CONT activity versus REST . Exercise intensity was measured through % VO 2max , i . e . the percent - age of a subject’s maximal oxygen uptake ( VO 2max ) . Intensities reported in Jankovec et al . [ 2011 ] and Soo et al . [ 1996 ] via heart rate reserve ( HR res ) – 60 and 50 % HR res , respectively – were transformed to their equivalent % VO 2max values ( 55 and 46 % VO 2max ) based on pre - vious studies [ da Cunha et al . , 2011 ; Gaskill et al . , 2004 ] . For Yamanouchi et al . [ 2002 ] , an intensity of 20 % VO 2max was imputed as corresponding to the range 90 – 110 beats per minute ( bpm ) [ Rotstein and Meckel , 2000 ] . Figure 4 . 14 ( panel a ) depicts a moderate dependency of RoC E with respect to physical ac - tivity intensity , with regression slope equal to − 0 . 0200 mmol / L · h − 1 per unit of % VO 2 max ; although not statistically signiﬁcant ( p = 0 . 69 ) . This negative slope reveals more pronounced – i . e . faster – decay rates in glycaemia associated with more vigorous CONT exercise , across the range of intensities covered by the included studies ( 20 – 75 % VO 2max ) ; whereas milder exertions produce decays in glycaemia of a lesser absolute magnitude ; hence slower . Con - versely , Figure 4 . 14 ( panel b ) shows how glycaemia tended to recover more rapidly after more vigorous CONT bouts , with a positive regression slope equaling + 0 . 0117 mmol / L · h − 1 per unit of % VO 2max ( p = 0 . 87 , not statistically signiﬁcant ) in the range of intensities covered by this analysis . 4 . 3 . 4 Discussion 4 . 3 . 4 . 1 Main ﬁndings This systematic review and meta - analysis , which aggregated results from a total of ten publications , evaluated and quantiﬁed the acute impact of various types of structured exercise sessions on the glucoregulatory balance in people with T1D . A key part of its novel contribution resides in the fact that no previous work in literature had addressed the quantiﬁcation of the acute eﬀects of exercise on glycaemia , task which was tackled here by means of RoC measures . Average RoC values during exercise and in the immediately subsequent recovery phases , along with their corresponding 95 % CIs , were estimated by detrending within - study variations in glycaemia over time . Sub - analyses between speciﬁc exercise categories were also conduced . In summary , CONT exercise at moderate intensities ( range 20 − 75 % VO 2max ) was found to be associated with glucose concentrations which : a ) declined during physical activity at a rapid rate , if compared to resting periods ( RoC E { CONT vs . REST } = − 4 . 43 mmol / L · h − 1 on average ) ; and b ) slowly reverted after the bout concluded ( mean RoC R { CONT vs . REST } = + 0 . 70 mmol / L · h − 1 ) . In addition , these results are in reasonable qualitative and quantitative concordance with glucose RoCs reported during exercise by Dubé et al . [ 2005 , 2006 ] before rescue dextrose had to be infused intravenously to correct hypogly - caemia events in those experiments . In particular , Dubé et al . [ 2005 ] documented RoC E 43 4 . 3 .

[ 2006 ] reported RoC E values of − 9 . 6 ± 2 . 4 and − 6 . 0 ± 1 . 2 mmol / L · h − 1 ( mean ± SEM ) for their early and late postprandial exercise arms . On the other hand , decreases in glycaemia for RESIST physical activity were milder than in the case of CONT exercise , both in : a ) the comparison with REST as a common reference : RoC E { RESIST vs . REST } = − 2 . 61 mmol / L · h − 1 on average , against mean RoC E { CONT vs . REST } = − 4 . 43 mmol / L · h − 1 ; and b ) in the direct comparison : RoC E { RESIST vs . CONT } = + 2 . 86 mmol / L · h − 1 . Likewise , recovery rates were slower for RESIST . However , in the case of IHE exercise quantitative discrepancies arose between compar - isons . RoC E values calculated with respect to the REST reference – based on two studies [ Guelﬁ et al . , 2005a ; Iscoe and Riddell , 2011 ] – yielded very pronounced decays ( RoC E { IHE vs . REST } = − 5 . 25 mmol / L · h − 1 on average ) versus the comparatively more restrained absolute values for CONT ( mean RoC E { CONT vs . REST } = − 4 . 43 mmol / L · h − 1 ) . In contrast , analyses of IHE directly versus CONT indicated slower glucose decreases for IHE ( RoC E { IHE vs . CONT } = + 1 . 57 mmol / L · h − 1 ) , with results based on the aggregation of three studies [ Guelﬁ et al . , 2005b ; Maran et al . , 2010 ; Iscoe and Riddell , 2011 ] . 4 . 3 . 4 . 2 Strengths a ) A comprehensive systematic review of literature was performed , identifying 10 pub - lished studies as relevant to this meta - analysis . Three exercise types were included : continuous physical activity at moderate intensity ( CONT ) , intermittent high - intensity ( IHE ) and resistance exercise ( RESIST ) . b ) In addition , a novel methodology was presented for the quantitative evaluation of acute trends in glycaemia via RoC magnitudes , where temporal variations were ap - 45 4 . 3 . Systematic review : Quantiﬁcation of the acute eﬀect of exercise on glycaemia in T1D proximated by rectilinear segments and average rates - of - change were computed for both exercise and immediate recovery stages . c ) By recording temporal ﬂuctuations in the reference proﬁles and subtracting them out at a study level ( i . e . prior to the pooling ) , spurious background trends due to factors other than exercise itself were mitigated in each particular trial . Hence , bias was reduced . 4 . 3 . 4 . 3 Limitations a ) Discrepancies in the outcomes for IHE modality . Quantitatively discrepant evidence was encountered regarding the magnitude of exercise eﬀects on RoC E for IHE as compared with CONT . In the analyses with REST as common reference ( Figure 4 . 10 ) , the aggregation of two IHE studies yielded RoC E { IHE vs . REST } = − 5 . 25 mmol / L · h − 1 ( 95 % CI [ − 7 . 02 , − 3 . 48 ] mmol / L · h − 1 , I 2 = 0 % ) , versus a compara - tively more restricted decay for CONT : RoC E { CONT vs . REST } = − 4 . 43 mmol / L · h − 1 ( 95 % CI [ − 6 . 06 , − 2 . 79 ] mmol / L · h − 1 , I 2 = 41 % ) calculated on the basis of 7 studies and 11 comparisons ( Figure 4 . 9 ) . Conversely , the direct confrontation ( Figure 4 . 12 ) resulted in RoC E { IHE vs . CONT } = + 2 . 86 mmol / L · h − 1 ( 95 % CI [ − 1 . 49 , + 7 . 20 ] mmol / L · h − 1 , I 2 = 41 % ) , with three studies involved ; pointing to a slower decline in glycaemia for IHE than for CONT ( p = 0 . 15 , not signiﬁcant ) . The scarcity of available studies involving IHE – four in total [ Guelﬁ et al . , 2005a , b ; Iscoe and Riddell , 2011 ; Maran et al . , 2010 ] , with Iscoe and Riddell [ 2011 ] presenting REST , CONT and IHE trial arms – may explain this shortcoming to some extent . Statistical heterogeneity was also encountered ( I 2 = 53 % for RoC E { IHE vs . CONT } ) , along with substantial methodological diversity among study protocols , in particular when deﬁn - ing the IHE session . Guelﬁ et al . [ 2005a ] utilized intermittent 4 - s short bursts by maximal sprints every 2 min , with subjects remaining seated without physical activity between sprints – i . e . ‘passive’ recovery – . In another study [ Guelﬁ et al . , 2005b ] , the same re - searchers deﬁned a diﬀerent protocol in which periods between their 4 - s maximal sprints corresponded to sustained physical activity at 40 % VO 2max . On the other hand , Maran et al . [ 2010 ] utilized submaximal sprints – 85 % VO 2max – with duration 5 s also repeated every 2 min . In an even more diverse protocol , Iscoe and Riddell [ 2011 ] compared CONT at sustained 55 % VO 2max versus IHE at sustained 50 % VO 2max plus 15 s maximal sprints every 5 min , with a design which aimed at an identical total mechanical work for both tasks along the entire session . In terms of glucose variations , Guelﬁ et al . [ 2005b ] docu - mented a greater absolute decline for CONT ( − 4 . 4 ± 1 . 2 mmol / L in 45 min , mean ± SD ) versus IHE ( − 2 . 9 ± 0 . 8 mmol / L ) , with statistical signiﬁcance ( p = 0 . 006 ) ; whereas Maran et al . [ 2010 ] observed glycaemia measurements that tended to be higher after IHE , but not signiﬁcantly so . Conversely , Iscoe and Riddell [ 2011 ] reported virtually identical glycaemic proﬁles throughout the CONT and IHE bouts , plus in the recovery stage until 2 . 25 h post - exercise ; although noticeable diﬀerences in terms of nocturnal levels : an increased risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia events < 4 mmol / L was reported for the CONT trial arm ( with 2 hypoglycaemia events per night after REST , compared to 5 events after CONT and 3 after IHE ) . Interestingly , these ﬁndings are in marked contradiction with those by Maran et al . [ 2010 ] , who reported 2 nocturnal hypoglycaemia events < 3 . 33 mmol / L after CONT , against 7 events for IHE ( p < 0 . 05 ) . In conclusion , there appears to be conﬂicting evidence in the availiable literature regarding the acute eﬀects of IHE on glycaemia in T1D . Further research in this direction may be needed . 46 4 . Physical activity in T1D b ) Discarded publications . A collection of studies were found ( n = 22 , Figure 4 . 7 ) which , had they been incorporated into this systematic review and meta - analysis , would have expanded analyses and may have increased their statistical power . This group of articles addressed the eﬀectiveness of auxiliary interventions aimed to ameliorate exercise - induced glucose excursions , includ - ing : modiﬁcations of the insulin regimes to accommodate exercise ( e . g . alternative insulin preparations [ Arutchelvam et al . , 2009 ] , pump cessation [ Tsalikian et al . , 2006 ; DirecNet Study Group , 2005 ] or bolus reductions [ West et al . , 2010 ] ) , as well as various food sup - plementation strategies [ Dubé et al . , 2012 ; Perrone et al . , 2005 ; West et al . , 2011 ] , among others . Given the particualr study design and focus of such experiments , the strategy under inspection was either applied ( intervention arm ) or not ( control arm ) , but subjects exercised in both trial arms . Therefore , subtracting the inherent within - study background spurious trends in glycaemia would have not been feasible . Thus , those publications were dismissed from this systematic review and meta - analysis to avoid introducing bias in the calculation of aggregated RoCs . c ) Restriction of the intensity range under analysis . The meta - regression carried out here to ascertain the dose / response relationship to varying exercise intensities in RoC E for CONT vs . REST ( section 4 . 3 . 3 . 3 . 2 ) showed more pro - nounced decays for increasing load . Nonetheless , this conclusion should be restricted to the range of intensities under analysis ( 20 – 75 % VO 2max ) , which broadly corresponds to moderate - to - vigorous exertions . Very vigorous exercise – i . e . > 80 % VO 2max – was reported to induce post - exercise hyperglycaemia in T1D , mainly due to exacerbated catecholamine releases causing 7 - to 8 - fold rises in glucose production which are not matched by glucose utilization , which increases 3 - to 4 - fold [ Marliss and Vranic , 2002 ; Sigal et al . , 1999 , 2000 ] . d ) Potential confounders . Several aspects of potential relevance were not explicitly addressed in the quantitative analyses : d . 1 ) Method for the measurement of glucose . Blood sampling – used in 7 out of 10 studies [ Jankovec et al . , 2011 ; Maran et al . , 2010 ; Peter et al . , 2005 ; Rabasa - Lhoret et al . , 2001 ; Soo et al . , 1996 ; Yamanouchi et al . , 2002 ; Yardley et al . , 2013b ] – constitutes the most accurate and reliable technique for measure - ment . Capillary samples – which were obtained in two studies [ Guelﬁ et al . , 2005a , b ] 1 – are comparably more prone to error and delays than venous blood determinations . The third alternative , continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) , has in principle lower accuracy than both venous and capillary measurements . Nonetheless , it was the technique of choice for Iscoe and Riddell [ 2011 ] ; whereas Yardley et al . [ 2013b ] used CGM in addition to blood samples to study the accuracy achieved by CGM sensors under exercise circumstances . However , all of the data from Yardley et al . [ 2013b ] incorporated into this meta - analysis correspond to blood measurements only . According to Yardley et al . [ 2013b ] , CGM underestimated considerably plasma glucose at REST ( − 1 . 29 ± 1 . 39 mmol / L , mean ± SD , p < 0 . 001 ) , to a lower extent during RESIST ( − 0 . 71 ± 1 . 35 mmol / L , p < 0 . 001 ) and with non - signiﬁcant errors for CONT exercise ( − 0 . 11 ± 1 . 71 mmol / L , p = 0 . 416 ) . On the contrary , CGM was reportedly associated with substantial er - rors when measuring during exercise for pregnant women with T1D [ Kumareswaran et al . , 1 Authors in [ Guelﬁ et al . , 2005a , b ] also collected venous blood samples , although these were used only to measure free insulin , glucagon or growth hormone concentrations , among others ; not to determine glycaemia . 47 4 . 3 . Systematic review : Quantiﬁcation of the acute eﬀect of exercise on glycaemia in T1D 2013a ] : 18 . 4 % error with respect to plasma glucose during brisk walking , versus 11 . 8 % at rest ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Of note , this study by Kumareswaran et al . [ 2013a ] reported results which are qualitatively consistent with the meta - analysis here , namely : a decay of 24 . 6 % in terms of relative rate - of - change for exercise , versus 12 . 3 % in sedentary situations ( p < 0 . 001 ) . d . 2 ) Glycaemia level at the onset of the physical activity session . By means of a glucose clamp experiment , Jenni et al . [ 2008 ] reported rates of CHO oxi - dation being higher for exercise performed under hyperglycaemia conditions ; whereas lipid oxidation was higher in their euglycaemia clamp . Consequently , more pronounced falls could have been expected if physical activity was commenced with high glucose values . In relation to Jenni et al . [ 2008 ] , the majority of the studies included in this review reported exercise carried out with similarly high glucose concentrations , around 10 mmol / L or above : • Soo et al . [ 1996 ] : approximate range 12 – 13 mmol / L • Rabasa - Lhoret et al . [ 2001 ] : 10 . 7 ± 0 . 7 mmol / L ( mean ± SEM ) for their 50 % VO 2max trial arm • Yamanouchi et al . [ 2002 ] : ∼ 10 mmol / L pre - prandial and ∼ 15 mmol / L post - prandial • Peter et al . [ 2005 ] : approximate range 11 – 12 mmol / L • Guelﬁ et al . [ 2005a ] : 10 . 9 ± 1 . 9 mmol / L for REST trial arm , and 11 . 0 ± 1 . 8 mmol / L for IHE ( mean ± SD ) • Guelﬁ et al . [ 2005b ] : 11 . 0 ± 2 . 3 mmol / L for CONT trial arm , and 11 . 5 ± 3 . 9 mmol / L for IHE ( mean ± SD ) • Yardley et al . [ 2013b ] : ∼ 10 mmol / L for their CONT trial arm . Conversely , other studies commenced at more restrained glycaemia levels : • Jankovec et al . [ 2011 ] : approximately range 7 – 8 mmol / L • Rabasa - Lhoret et al . [ 2001 ] : 8 . 8 ± 0 . 55 mmol / L for their 25 % VO 2max trial arm ; 8 . 5 ± 1 . 3 mmol / L for 75 % VO 2max ( mean ± SEM ) • Yardley et al . [ 2013b ] : ∼ 8 . 5 mmol / L for their RESIST trial arm . Information in this regard was not provided by Maran et al . [ 2010 ] ; whereas Iscoe and Riddell [ 2011 ] mentioned an absolute fall of approximately − 5 mmol / L and ∼ 50 % relative decay , although explicit data were not reported in either text or graphs . Among the included publications , the most marked decay rates were reported in this order by : • Yamanouchi et al . [ 2002 ] , post - breakfast exercise arm • Rabasa - Lhoret et al . [ 2001 ] , 50 % VO 2max arm • Peter et al . [ 2005 ] • Rabasa - Lhoret et al . [ 2001 ] , 75 % VO 2max arm • Yardley et al . [ 2013b ] , CONT arm . In view of these data , there does not appear to be an evident direct relationship between the higher blood glucose concentrations at exercise onset on the one side , and the more substantial RoC E values on the other hand . d . 3 ) Plasma insulin concentrations during exercise . Plasma circulating insulin during the physical activity session may have also had a role in the glucoregulatory response to exercise , then impacting the analyses as a confounder . In this regard , Chokkalingam et al . [ 2006 ] studied whole - body and muscle metabolism in exercise by means of an euglycaemic clamp experiment – glucose ﬁxed at approximately 8 mmol / L – under two hyperinsulinaemic regimes at diﬀerent levels : plasma insulin at ∼ 150 or ∼ 540 pmol / L ( which correspond to typical pre - and postprandial concentrations in T1D 48 4 . Physical activity in T1D patients ) . Authors observed markedly higher exogenous glucose utilization in the trial arm at 540 pmol / L . However , the amount of muscle glycogen utilized in both situations was similar , and CHO oxidation rates were only around 15 % higher in the trial arm with larger insulinaemia . Consequently , the inﬂuence of distinct plasma insulin levels in otherwise equivalent exercise conditions remains unclear [ Chokkalingam et al . , 2006 ] . Concerning the studies included here , experimental data on insulin concentrations were not provided in three articles [ Yardley et al . , 2013b ; Iscoe and Riddell , 2011 ; Maran et al . , 2010 ] . In other three cases , patients exercised at insulin levels lower than both conditions in Chokkalingam et al . [ 2006 ] : • Jankovec et al . [ 2011 ] : average insulinaemia ∼ 80 pmol / L , along with large inter - subject variability – nonetheless , without statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences versus REST – . • Soo et al . [ 1996 ] : basal 84 ± 18 pmol / L ( mean ± SEM ) . Authors reported no signiﬁcant correlation between basal free insulin and glycaemic response . • Yamanouchi et al . [ 2002 ] preprandial trial arm : 55 . 3 ± 21 . 5 pmol / L ( mean ± SD ) . Peter et al . [ 2005 ] documented an average plasma insulin of approximately 300 pmol / L during both REST and CONT , without statistical diﬀerences between trials in terms of area under the curve for insulinaemia ( p = 0 . 116 ) . On the other hand , physical activity bouts in the remaining studies took place at values comparable with the 150 pmol / L selected by Chokkalingam et al . [ 2006 ] : • Rabasa - Lhoret et al . [ 2001 ] : insulin bolus 90 min prior to exercise onset , peak insuli - naemia at 188 . 5 ± 28 . 0 pmol / L ( mean ± SD ) occurring 30 min pre - exercise • Yamanouchi et al . [ 2002 ] postprandial trial arm : insulin bolus 90 min before exercise start , with peak at 231 . 9 ± 162 . 3 pmol / L ( mean ± SD ) • Guelﬁ et al . [ 2005a ] : IHE exercise commenced at 198 . 1 ± 148 . 0 pmol / L ( mean ± SD ) ; no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence with respect to REST • Guelﬁ et al . [ 2005b ] : IHE and CONT exercise bouts commenced respectively at around 160 and 140 pmol / L ; without statistical diﬀerences in insulinaemia proﬁles at any point of exercise or recovery . d . 4 ) Time of the day . The time of the day at which exercise sessions were performed was not incorporated into the quantitative meta - analyses , although it may have inﬂuenced outcomes to some extent . In an euglycaemic clamp experiment in which exercise was performed in the afternoon ( 16 : 00 h ) , McMahon et al . [ 2007 ] showed that glucose infusion rates , necessary to maintain glycaemia stable , peaked in a biphasic manner : i ) during exercise and early recovery , plus ii ) in the night afterwards ( 00 : 00 h to 04 : 00 h ) . Conversely , in an otherwise equivalent experimental design but with exercise performed at 12 : 00 h , Davey et al . [ 2013 ] did not observe the same biphasic behaviour in glucose infusion rates , which were in turn elevated for 11 hours post - exercise . It is diﬃcult to draw solid conclusions in this regard from the studies included here , since all except three experiments were carried out in the morning ; the exceptions being : Maran et al . [ 2010 ] – exercise at approximately 14 : 00 h – , along with Iscoe and Riddell [ 2011 ] and Yardley et al . [ 2013b ] – both at 17 : 00 h – . d . 5 ) Fitness status and age . The eligible studies did not always provide explicit information on participants’ degree of ﬁtness or prior physical training status : only ﬁve did ( Table 4 . 3 ) . This aspect may have had an eﬀect on subjects’ glucoregulatory response , such as glucose uptake into skeletal 49 4 . 3 . Systematic review : Quantiﬁcation of the acute eﬀect of exercise on glycaemia in T1D muscle , which may vary even at a ﬁxed relative intensity , i . e . at the same % VO 2max [ Fujimoto et al . , 2003 ] . Moreover , the population studied by Guelﬁ et al . [ 2005a ] consisted of adolescents , whose hormonal response to physical activity may diﬀer from that of mature adults [ Riddell , 2008 ] . 4 . 3 . 4 . 4 Implications for clinical practice and research Better understanding of the acute eﬀects on glycaemia due to physical activity is of con - siderable importance to clinicians and T1D patients aiming at a tighter management of acute , exercise - related glucose excursions . Currently , guidelines for exercising with T1D are based on small studies or observational evidence . The glycaemia RoC magnitudes presented here , and expressed in measurable units [ mmol / L · h − 1 ] of temporal variation , may provide an accessible means of translating the eﬀect of exercise on acute glucose dynamics into applicable information that may beneﬁt patients’ self - management and the estimation of expectable temporal trends in glucose levels . This systematic review conﬁrmed and quantiﬁed the known glucose lowering eﬀects of mod - erate physical activity , with rapid decays under various circumstances followed by mild in - creases post - exercise . Resistance activity was associated with the most modest decreases . As major novelty , trends in blood glucose during and after exercise were quantiﬁed via two rate - of - change magnitudes RoC E , RoC R . This quantitative information – mean RoCs and their 95 % CIs – may be useful when advising patients on strategies to maintain optimal glu - cose control and to avoid post - exercise hyper - and ( especially ) hypoglycaemias , improving safety and quality of life for physically active people with T1D . This review also identiﬁed the lack of parallel controlled studies comparing physiological responses to diﬀerent exercise categories . In addition , conﬂicting evidence was encountered regarding the eﬀects of IHE physical activity in subjects with T1D . More homogeneous IHE exercise protocols – particularly in terms of sprint duration , frequency of repetition and intensity – may be needed , along with further research . 4 . 3 . 4 . 5 Comparison with previous reviews Tonoli et al . [ 2012 ] reviewd and analysed the overall eﬀect on glycaemic control of a single bout of physical activity , based on the pooling of 15 acute exercise studies : 9 aerobic and 6 IHE . Authors also surveyed the impact on HbA 1c of regular / chronic exercise training maintained for up to several months , although such aspect is out of the scope of current discussion . In the mentioned publication [ Tonoli et al . , 2012 ] , Cohen’s d statistic [ Cohen , 1988 ] was used as the main outcome to characterize the glucoregulatory impact of physical activity . Overall , substantial decreases in venous glucose levels due to acute aerobic exercise in adults were reported ( − 6 . 0 mean Cohen’s d value ; 95 % CI [ − 6 . 87 , − 5 . 14 ] ) , these reduc - tions being considerably larger than for acute IHE activity ( − 4 . 35 ; 95 % CI [ − 6 . 41 , − 2 . 65 ] for Cohen’s d ) . Whereas those results are in qualitative agreement with ﬁndings here , quantitative com - parisons are not feasible because Cohen’s d is a dimensionless magnitude which reﬂects the average diﬀerence in a relative manner , i . e . normalized by the standard deviation in each study [ Cohen , 1988 ] . In contrast and as a major contribution of this work , glucose varia - tions were ascertained in measurable terms via the novel RoC E , RoC R outcomes . These RoC magnitudes – expressed in tangible units : [ mmol / L · h − 1 ] – should provide a more ac - cessible and straightforward manner of estimating exercise - related glucose dynamics ; hence 50 4 . Physical activity in T1D more easily translated into clinical practice and patients’ self - management . Furthermore , the analysis of glucose dynamics by Tonoli et al . [ 2012 ] was extended here by incorporating the early recovery stage . On the other hand , authors agreed with the current discussion regarding the limitations of available literature : i ) pointing out the diﬃculty for pooling studies given the marked discrepancies in terms of exercise protocols , and ii ) advocating for more standardization and broader populations of subjects in the studies . 51 4 . 3 . Systematic review : Quantiﬁcation of the acute eﬀect of exercise on glycaemia in T1D 52 Part III Monitoring and recognition of physical activity 53 Chapter 5 State of the art Physical activity ( PA ) is a complex behaviour whose characterization involves various im - portant aspects , including [ Valanou et al . , 2006 ] but not limited to : PA intensity , duration and frequency of its practise ; exercise modality and the predominant metabolic pathway involved in energy fuelling ; or whether PA is performed for leisure , for transportation or as part of the subject’s occupation . Consequently , these and other contextual factors would ideally be required for a detailed understanding of the nature of PA patterns and the degree of involvement of individuals and / or populations in regular PA . This information is impor - tant , for instance , to study the interaction between PA and diﬀerent health conditions , or to address the eﬀectiveness of PA - based medical interventions [ Westerterp , 2009 ] . Speciﬁcally , two aspects have attracted most attention and research eﬀort , namely : i ) de - termining PA intensity levels , and ii ) calculating energy expenditure ( EE ) induced by exercise , which are in turn closely related to PA intensity . In this regard , three processes contribute to the total energy expenditure ( TEE ) in humans [ Kumahara et al . , 2006 ] : a ) Basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) , which is the component responsible for covering energy needs for the basic physiological functioning . It constitutes the major contribution to TEE – estimated around 60 % TEE for sedentary individuals [ Kumahara et al . , 2006 ] – , although its absolute magnitude depends largely on each subject’s body size [ Ainslie et al . , 2003 ] . b ) Diet - induced thermogenesis , often estimated to represent 10 % of TEE for an average mixed diet that meets energy requirements [ Westerterp , 2004 ] . c ) Physical activity - induced energy expenditure ( PAEE ) . Obviously , the contribution of PAEE – which may account for approximately 30 % of TEE in sedentary individuals – is strongly dependent on each subject’s lifestyle . However , the absolute values of PAEE – generally expressed in [ kcal / h ] or [ kJ / h ] units – are primarily inﬂuenced by body weight via the energy cost of moving one’s own body mass . Other factors , such as the mechanical eﬃciency of performing a certain task , also play a role on PAEE , although variations in eﬃciency are small across most subjects . Consequently , absolute PAEE numbers are not the preferred way to reﬂect the intensity at which an activity was performed , because they would not be suitable for establishing comparisons across individuals with diﬀerent sizes . In this sense , PAEE measured in [ kcal / h · kg − 1 ] – i . e . normalized by body weight – would serve better for fair comparisons . Nevertheless , alternative magnitudes such as metabolic equivalents of task ( METs ) are often employed . MET conceptualization is conceived to express the energy cost of a certain activity as a multiple of the BMR at rest . Hence , METs are commonly viewed as a simple descriptor of workload levels across activity modalities and populations [ Byrne , 2005 ] . For example , 55 5 . 1 . Monitoring and measurement of PA according to the most recent version of Ainsworth et al . [ 2011 ] ’s Compendium of physical activities and MET values ( Figure 5 . 1 ) ; a subject who practised mountain bike would on average spend during this activity 8 . 5 times his / her BMR . By convention , 1 . 0 MET is assumed equivalent to 1 . 0 kcal / min · kg − 1 , based on the original study presenting the MET concept with one 70 - kg , 40 - year - old male [ Wasserman et al . , 1994 ] . However , O 2 consump - tions during rest were reported to be signiﬁcantly lower than this ﬁgure ( up to 20 – 35 % lower ) for a considerably large and heterogeneous population [ Byrne , 2005 ] , an issue which implies that quantifying PAEE based on METs could result in signiﬁcant overestimations [ Byrne , 2005 ] . Nonetheless and despite these known limitations , METs are very widely used in clinical practise to assess the degree of physical activeness and to prescribe exercise plans . In particular , the ACSM [ American College of Sports Medicine , 2011 ; Garber et al . , 2011 ] provides its guidelines for exercise prescription expressed in METs – more precisely , in [ MET · min / week ] – , distinguishing ﬁve levels of interest regarding PA intensity , namely : i ) very light ( i . e . below 2 MET ) , ii ) light ( 2 – 3 MET ) , iii ) moderate ( 3 – 6 MET ) , iv ) vig - orous ( 6 – 8 . 8 MET ) , and v ) very vigorous ( above 8 . 8 MET ) . However , these ﬁve levels are frequently summarized into three [ Pate , 1995 ] : i ) low ( i . e . under 3 MET ) , ii ) moderate ( 3 – 6 MET ) , and iii ) vigorous ( above 6 MET ) . Other relatively common ways of establishing comparisons of exercise intensity [ Ameri - can College of Sports Medicine , 2011 ; Garber et al . , 2011 ] are expressing it as a frac - tion / percentage of each individual’s : • maximum oxygen uptake ( VO 2max ) , • maximal heart rate ( HR max ) ; or alternatively , with respect to the corresponding reserves , these calculated in terms of the diﬀerence between maximal and basal ( i . e . resting ) values : • oxygen uptake reserve ( VO 2res ) = VO 2max − VO 2basal • heart rate reserve ( HR res ) = HR max − HR basal . In broad terms and according to the American College of Sports Medicine [ 2011 ] ; Garber et al . [ 2011 ] , 3 MET are approximately equivalent to 40 % VO 2res or HR res , to 46 % VO 2max and 64 % HR max ; whereas 6 MET would correspond to 60 % VO 2res or HR res , to 64 % VO 2max and 77 % HR max . Anyway , the accurate quantiﬁcation of EE is a notably challenging task , particularly due to the fact that many inter - and intra - individual factors ( in addition to those mentioned above ) aﬀect the ﬁnal energy and oxygen consumptions : age , sex , body size , cardiorespiratory ﬁtness , adiposity and body fat percentage , altitude , humidity , ambient temperature , fatigue or anaerobic contributions , among others . 5 . 1 Monitoring and measurement of PA The ideal technique to measure PA should be : objective , accurate and precise , robust and simple to use , with high temporal resolution , scalable to large populations , cost - eﬀective , minimally invasive and comfortably acceptable for the subjects being monitored . However , there is not any technique gathering all those features . Therefore , this section will address the comparison of those approaches which are currently available in common practise , brieﬂy reviewing their respective main strengths and limitations . 56 5 . State of the art Figure 5 . 1 : Example MET equivalences for a series of bicycling activities under vari - ous circumstances and degrees of exertion . Ainsworth et al . ’s Compendium of PAs and METs was ﬁrst released in 1993 [ Ainsworth et al . , 1993 ] , with subsequent updates in 2000 [ Ainsworth et al . , 2000 ] and 2011 [ Ainsworth et al . , 2011 ] .

Monitoring and measurement of PA 5 . 1 . 1 Direct calorimetry The direct calorimetry technique consists in a subject who stays in a thermally - isolated chamber during the tracked period , in rest and / or performing exercise . The chamber is equipped with sensors to determine the total amount of heat dissipated by his / her body , via the measurement of the temperatures of ingoing and outgoing water from a closed - circuit refrigeration system which is in charge of maintaining the chamber at a constant temperature ( Figure 5 . 2 ) . Advantages • Theoretically grounded , carrying out direct measurements of heat ﬂuxes • High precision and accuracy – with an estimated error below 1 % TEE [ Valanou et al . , 2006 ] – in quasi - stationary thermal conditions . Disadvantages • High technological demand • Expensive costs • Impractical or infeasible for the majority of situations , as it cannot be applied to extra - laboratory conditions • Not scalable to large populations • Low temporal resolutions given that heat ﬂows through the air are a slow process , an issue which translates to time lags and insensitivity to rapid variations . 5 . 1 . 2 Indirect calorimetry With this type of solutions , body’s energy demands are measured via the determination of respiratory gas ﬂuxes , speciﬁcally O 2 consumption and CO 2 production rates . Assuming that : a ) all inhaled oxygen is employed to oxidise fuels , b ) all of the CO 2 produced in oxidation is exhaled , and that c ) those airﬂows can be measured accurately by the equipment , the total amount of energy involved in the process can be calculated using appropriate formulae [ Ainslie et al . , 2003 ] . Diﬀerent technological implementations exist . Closed - circuit systems , which are particu - larly suitable for measuring resting BMR ( Figure 5 . 3 , left panel ) , operate in isolation with respect to outside ambient air . The respirometer initially contains pure O 2 only , and the system proceeds by determining the amounts of CO 2 which are continuously eliminated from the circuit . On the contrary , open - circuit solutions use normal ambient air , analysing the contents of O 2 and CO 2 in the airﬂow . Finally , commercial portable systems ( Figure 5 . 3 , right panel ) facilitate a relatively unobstructive monitoring , with the subject carrying the equipment during exercise . Of note , these portable devices can measure pulmonary gas exchanges breath by breath . Advantages • Physiologically grounded solution • High accuracy and precision , up to the point of serving often as a ‘gold standard’ for comparison with respect to other techniques estimating EEs • Portable devices allow the monitoring of exercise in more diverse and realistic condi - tions . 58 5 . State of the art Disadvantages • High technological demand • Expensive costs • Not scalable to large populations , mainly due to its costs , which limit its practical applicability to studies with a reduced number of participants • Possible uncomfort caused by the airﬂow system ; in particular , by the mask . 5 . 1 . 3 Doubly labelled water The doubly labelled water ( DLW ) technique requires participants to consume an oral dose of water with a known amount of stable – i . e . non - radioactive – tracers diluted in it . Diluted hydrogen ( 2 H , deuterium ) and oxygen isotopes ( 18 O ) serve as biological markers to trace the rates at which they are excreted from the body . After a few hours from ingestion , DLW ( 2 H 218 O ) is mixed with the normal – i . e . non - labelled – hydrogen and oxygen in body ﬂuids . When energy is expended , the body produces CO 2 and water , which are subsequently elim - inated . In particular , CO 2 is lost through breathing ; whereas water is evacuated via breath , urination , sweat and other evaporations . Thus , the 18 O tracer is part of both eliminated water and CO 2 ; whereas 2 H tracer is only contained in water but not in CO 2 . As a con - sequence , 18 O becomes disposed at quicker rates than 2 H ( Figure 5 . 4 ) , and their diﬀerence reﬂects the rate of CO 2 production , in turn strongly related to total EE . Diﬀerent formulae allow the EE estimation from the rate of CO 2 production , based on certain assumptions [ Ainslie et al . , 2003 ] . Isotope concentrations are measured from body ﬂuid samples – blood , saliva and urine – taken at the beginning and at the end of the period being tracked , which typically lies in a range between 4 days to 3 weeks . Advantages • Physiologically grounded methodology • High accuracy , precision and validity ; often used as ‘gold standard’ for comparison purposes [ Ainslie et al . , 2003 ] • Non - invasive and non - intrusive to normal activity patterns • The most reliable alternative to measure PAEE in free - living conditions . Disadvantages • Demands considerable expertise and technology • Expensive costs • Not scalable to large groups of users • Lack of temporal resolution . It is only possible to determine the total EE accumulated over the whole period of observation , when ﬂuid samples are taken . Consequently , there is not information about the number of PA sessions , their frequency , duration or intensity . • Slight errors – below 5 % [ Ainslie et al . , 2003 ] – may arise in ﬁeld applications due to uncertainties in the respiratory quotient with respect to the assumed values . Errors stem from the fact that DLW can actually measure CO 2 production rates instead of O 2 consumptions . 59 5 . 1 .

State of the art 5 . 1 . 4 Heart rate monitors This technique’s operating principle resides in tracking heart rate ( HR ) as a relevant phys - iological response to exercise by the organism . During PA , increases in terms of exercise intensity , energy consumptions and O 2 requirements are closely related to rises in HR . This relationship holds true over a considerable range of intensities , specially around intermedi - ate exertion levels ( at approximately 110 – 150 beats / min ) , where the EE - HR relationship is fairly linear [ Freedson and Miller , 2000 ] . The most widely accepted method to estimate EE from HR measurements is the so - called ‘ﬂex’ approach [ Spurr et al . , 1988 ] , although others exist , e . g . Montgomery et al . [ 2009 ] . ‘Flex’ is based in the fact that at rest or during very light activities , variations in HR do not reﬂect changes in energy demands in a proportional manner , as they however do for more vigorous intensities . Consequently , for low HR readings , ‘ﬂex’ imputes the resting BMR as its estimation for energy consumptions ; whereas for higher HR values – above an empirically found ‘ﬂex’ point , hence its name – EE calculations follow an estimation curve which must be calibrated individually . Advantages • HR is a physiological response in good relation with exercise intensity and O 2 con - sumption rates • Easy to measure , an aspect which makes this technique particularly suitable for the ambulatory assessment of overall physical activeness in free - living conditions • Aﬀordable equipment , with manageable costs for medium - sized populations • Good temporal resolution , providing information about PA intensity in diﬀerent time intervals , as well as duration and frequency of exertions . Disadvantages • Wearing the chest strap for long periods may become uncomfortable • Several factors besides PA have a noticeable eﬀect on HR responses , e . g . body pos - ture , stress or fatigue , illness , medication , caﬀeine and other stimulators , temperature or humidity , among others • Subject characteristics – such as age , sex , or his / her cardiovascular ﬁtness level – also play a role on measured HR values . Thus , if accurate EE estimations are desired , individual calibrations of the ‘ﬂex’ HR - EE curves are needed in order to prevent excessive inter - subject errors . However , these individualized calibration procedures may be considerably time - and resource - consuming [ Valanou et al . , 2006 ] • The cardiovascular response to high - volume circuit resistance exercise – a modality with notable anaerobic contributions – was reported to be considerably diﬀerent to moderate - intensity aerobic PA [ Gotshalk et al . , 2004 ] . In addition , other comparable physiological magnitudes – such as pulmonary ventilation rates , or even body temperature – might also be monitored . As in the case of HR , ventilation rates are a good indicator of the stress induced by PA on the cardiorespiratory system , in turn related to O 2 consumptions . However , similar disadvantages apply : for example , dependencies with respect to ﬁtness , stress , temperature or humidity , among other factors . 61 5 . 1 . Monitoring and measurement of PA 5 . 1 . 5 Motion sensors This section covers various devices which , being based on diﬀerent sensing principles and technologies , collect data streams that reﬂect motion patterns . In brief : pedometers recog - nize and count steps , whereas accelerometers detect accelerations induced by displacements . A third family of sensors are gyroscopes , which track angular orientation and momentum . However , its use in literature is considerably scarcer than the other two technologies . 5 . 1 . 5 . 1 Pedometers This type of sensors is conceived to detect steps and strides , in general with simple designs and modest technological requirements . Detection is typically achieved by means of a threshold on vertical acceleration , and depending on the particular equipment , devices may be worn on hip , waist , ankle or shoe . Advantages • Low cost and scalability • Devices can be worn in a comfortable and unobstructive manner in free - living condi - tions • Easy to use , with low technological demand • Good choice for interventions focused on the monitoring of walking or running activi - ties . In this regard , walking is a very frequent recommendation in those interventions whose aim is to promote active lifestyles among sedentary populations . Disadvantages • Lack of sensitivity to any activity other than walking or running • Lack of detailed descriptive information about walking patterns , e . g . stride length or speed , if climbing up - / downhill or up - / downstairs • Scarce utility in the overall prediction of EE • Limited or absent temporal resolution – specially in low - and mid - end commercial devices – , since normally just total cumulative results are available . Thus , it is not possible to analyse step counts by separate time periods . 5 . 1 . 5 . 2 Accelerometers This technology is founded on recording accelerations caused by motion in one or multiple axes , perpendicular to each other . Devices normally incorporate a piezoelectric sensor that , as a response to movement , suﬀers certain deformation which translates into voltage changes whose amplitude is in proportion to the magnitude of acceleration [ Chen and Bassett , 2005 ] . In general , their raw accelerometry signal may contain a large gravitational component , although this contribution is often removed by internal pre - processing algorithms ( e . g . high - pass ﬁltering ) within the devices . This is for example the case of commercial accelerometers speciﬁcally designed for PA monitoring . There is a wide range of technological deployments : from a single uni - axial sensor with relatively low sampling frequency – such as 1 Hz – , up to a network of several triaxial ac - celerometers placed on diﬀerent body locations ( typically hip , waist , chest , arm , wrist and / or ankle , among others ) working at higher frequencies – up to 64 Hz – [ Chen and Bas - sett , 2005 ] . In this regard , the maximal frequency of the center of mass in human motion 62 5 . State of the art was estimated to lie below 8 Hz [ Winter et al . , 1976 ] , although band - pass ﬁlters around the range 0 . 25 – 7 Hz [ Chen and Bassett , 2005 ] are often used in order to discard both gravity and high - frequency noisy components . However , the most widespread commercial accelerometers – in particular , those conceived for its dedicated use as PA monitors in the ﬁelds of sports science and epidemiological research – do not provide the raw ( i . e . unprocessed ) acceleration signal as their default output . Instead , these commercial equipments carry out preconditioning tasks on the raw accelerometry signal via proprietary algorithms . Output is then produced in the form of the so - called ‘accelerometry counts’ – also known as ‘activity counts’ – which despite extremely common , suﬀer from the important problem of lacking a straightforward physical or physiological interpretation [ Chen and Bassett , 2005 ] . Activity counts are accumulated over ‘epochs’ , which are the basic analysis periods , often conﬁgurable by the researchers . The accumulation is performed following one of the various existing strategies , namely : a ) when the raw acceleration signal crosses a pre - set threshold value , assumed represen - tative of meaningful motion b ) in proportion to the maximum amplitude reached by the signal along current epoch , with higher amplitudes corresponding to more counts c ) integrating the rectiﬁed accelerometry signal over the epoch . The latter alternative , which is the most robust against noise among the three , is also the most frequently applied one [ Chen and Bassett , 2005 ] . Nonetheless , details in the propri - etary algorithms implemented by each company , as well as internal hardware conﬁgurations ( e . g . ampliﬁcation gains ) , result in ﬁnal output counts that are totally manufacturer - speciﬁc . This issue hinders critically – or prevents altogether – the direct comparison of accelerometry outcomes between diﬀerent brands . As a matter of practice , the translation from accelerometry counts into PA intensity levels has been mainly performed by means of validated thresholds on counts – most commonly known in the ﬁeld as ‘cutpoints’ [ Freedson et al . , 1998 ; Hendelman et al . , 2000 ; Swartz et al . , 2000 ] – ; whereas EEs have been traditionally estimated via linear regression formu - lae , also based on counts [ Crouter et al . , 2006 ] . Those formulae were derived and validated in experiments with speciﬁc exercise protocols and population groups , with their accuracy in terms of EE estimations addressed by several publications [ Crouter et al . , 2006 ; Plasqui and Westerterp , 2007 ; Lyden et al . , 2010 ; Altini et al . , 2015 ] . In general , notable variations with respect to achieved accuracy were reported , with less accurate results being obtained if applying the estimators to activities which were not closely related ( in terms of simi - lar movement mechanics , intensity and / or population characteristics ) compared to those employed in the experiment from which the formula was derived [ Crouter et al . , 2006 ] . Consequently , systematic over - or underestimations may arise , depending on the speciﬁc activity being monitored . In conclusion , there is not any single equation which can perform acceptably well across a wide range of situations . On the contrary , diﬀerent formulae may be reasonably suitable for particular activities . Advantages • Objective quantiﬁcation of body movement • Capability to track motion along diﬀerent axes simultaneously • High temporal resolution and good levels of information detail , in terms of degree of PA intensity , frequency and duration of the session • Sensitivity to subtle movements and low levels of activity 63 5 . 1 . Monitoring and measurement of PA • Devices can generally be worn in a comfortable manner , not becoming obstructive in free - living conditions . Disadvantages • Moderate to high costs • Movements can show very complicated signal patterns , which may be diﬃcult to characterize and / or to interpret • Activity counts , due to the methodology used for their computation , cannot capture relevant parts of the information contained in the signal , e . g . spectral components • Reduced or eventually null sensitivity to exercises which do not involve movement of the body part to which the sensor is attached ( e . g . static muscular work ) . This issue may in turn lead to a marked variability in the overall accuracy in terms of PA recognition , depending on the location of the sensor in relation to the movement pattern • Lack of standardization across manufacturers in terms of units for ‘counts’ • Variability in the accuracy achieved by the diﬀerent existing EE estimation formulae . Some of these drawbacks – particularly those concerning ‘counts’ – may be solved if re - searchers by - pass counts and instead take full control of the raw acceleration signal . In this regard , a promising strategy might be to use accelerometer - enabled general purpose sensors ( e . g . those embedded in smartphones ) , with the advantages of their high penetration along with their decreasing costs . The interested reader is referred to ‘Future works’ ( section 9 . 2 ) for a further discussion regarding this topic . 5 . 1 . 5 . 3 Combining accelerometers and heart rate monitors Accelerometry – which involves primarily mechanical aspects of PA – along with the HR signal – as a physiological response to exercise – constitute two complementary sources of information whose combination may provide richer PA descriptions than addressing these same magnitudes by separate . This approach may in turn help to overcome the limitations of each methods alone ; up to the point that numerous works from the ﬁeld of sports science advocate for this type of promising combinations [ Freedson and Miller , 2000 ; Ainslie et al . , 2003 ; Corder et al . , 2005 ; Plasqui and Westerterp , 2005 , 2006 , 2007 ; Valanou et al . , 2006 ; Westerterp , 2009 ] . 5 . 1 . 6 Techniques with human intervention 5 . 1 . 6 . 1 Direct observation With this approach , a subject’s PA behaviour is tracked by an external observer agent , who keeps a detailed record on information concerning PA along a period of time . In some cases , such as paediatric studies , this direct observation is a convenient option Valanou et al . [ 2006 ] . On the other hand and based on those PA records , simple EE estimations can be derived applying tabulated MET values in Ainsworth et al . [ 2011 ] ’s Compendium . Advantages • Rich contextual information about PA is provided : e . g . type of activity , location , etc . • Very limited technological demand 64 5 . State of the art Disadvantages • The external observer may interfere ostensibly with the observed subject’s normal PA behaviour • Subjective component for the observer – specially in the grading of PA intensity – , an issue which imposes the need for qualiﬁed observers in order to ensure quality in the data collection • Inter - and intra - observer variability • Time - and resource - consuming technique , which translates into restrained coverage periods . 5 . 1 . 6 . 2 Reports and activity logs Several approaches are based on requesting participants to conduce self - reports or related variants . These solutions , which are mainly used in large - scale epidemiological studies to assess the degree of physical activeness of a population , diﬀer in a number of aspects , including : reporting periodicity , total time span covered by the report , factors of PA being addressed ( e . g . intensity , duration , frequency or type ) , or method to summarize data and to score PA . In this regard , four major categories can be distinguished [ Valanou et al . , 2006 ] : a ) Activity diaries and logs : Subjects are required to produce detailed annotations of the activities they perform with their durations , including as well either a de - scription of the activity ( diary ) or a correspondence with a PA category within a preﬁxed set of PA options ( log ) . The main advantage of these approaches resides in the rich contextual information which is obtained ; whereas limitations include : the intensive eﬀort , motivation and cooperation demanded from participants given that the registration may become tedious , subjective factors – especially regarding exer - cise intensity descriptions – , sensitivity to oversights and possible alterations of the subject’s patterns with respect to his / her common PA habits . b ) Quantitative history questionnaires : These surveys examine PA retrospectively , following a detailed collection of items conceived with the aim of retrieving profound descriptions about PA , at the expense of a considerable burden for the participant in ﬁlling out the questionnaire . Similar disadvantages apply as those mentioned above for the case of diaries and logs , with additional risks in terms of retrospective oversights . c ) Recall questionnaires : Shorter and simpler than the previous option , they encom - pass fewer questions , thus demanding less eﬀort to the participant . As a consequence , these recall questionnaires are usually applied to stratify populations in broad cate - gories regarding general activeness . d ) Global self - report questionnaires : Brief survey which provide a general overview description of each subject’s PA habits , usually spanning over long periods . They are most often intended to distinguish sedentary people from active . In general , all self - reporting . logs and questionnaire - based methods have the majority of strengths and limitations in common . Advantages • Very low technological demand • Suitable for large - scale epidemiological studies • Useful for ranking / stratifying degrees of physical activeness 65 5 . 1 . Monitoring and measurement of PA • Aﬀordable costs • Considerable amount of detail and contextual information can be potentially achieved , although this aspect depends ultimately on the particular report methodology em - ployed and on the cooperation and willingness of participants . Disadvantages • Reliance on subjects’ memory • Answers can be biased by aspects such as participant’s expectations or social accept - ability • Sensitivity to misinterpretations and incompleteness • Low accuracy , validity and reliability . Nonetheless , various validated methodologies exist : for instance , Bouchard et al . [ 1983 ] proposed a dairy / log with entries expected as often as every 15 min , applied to cover a 3 - day period and grouping exercise in 12 categories . Other examples of validated question - naires with widespread use are the International physical activity questionnaire ( IPAQ ) [ Craig et al . , 2003 ] or the Recent physical activity questionnaire ( RPAQ ) [ Baecke et al . , 1982 ; Golubic et al . , 2014 ] . As a remark , practical advices by specialists [ Valanou et al . , 2006 ] stress the importance of selecting an appropriate reporting mechanism which is in accordance with the particular aims of the study and with the speciﬁcities of the targeted cohort . 5 . 1 . 7 Overview of techniques for PA monitoring As outlined above , there does not exist an universally superior method to monitor PA with all of the ideally desirable characteristics : high accuracy , precision and reliability , robust - ness , aﬀordability in terms of both cost and resource requirements , minimal intrusiveness , scalability and suitability for free - living conditions . Consequently , a trade - oﬀ among these aspects must be taken into account for the choice of a particular methodology . In this regard , considerations must be made attending to : the size of the targeted population , the duration of the monitored period , the required level of detail ( in terms of accuracy , temporal resolution and need for extra contextual information ) , the environment in which the experiment will be conduced ( i . e . if in a laboratory setup or free - living conditions ) ; as well as concerning budget constraints , technological barriers or social aspects . DLW and indirect calorimetry are currently considered the ‘gold standards’ in terms of accuracy , precision and reliability . However , they suﬀer from considerable limitations , such as scalability problems , cost - ineﬃciency , DLW’s lack of temporal resolution and indirect calorimetry’s inapplicability to extra - laboratory conditions . On the other hand , a promising solution to objectively track PA in free - living , ambulatory scenarios without the need for human intervention may be the fusion of accelerometry and HR sensors [ Freedson and Miller , 2000 ; Ainslie et al . , 2003 ; Corder et al . , 2005 ; Plasqui and Westerterp , 2006 , 2007 ; Valanou et al . , 2006 ; Westerterp , 2009 ] . Following this approach , this PhD thesis work will propose an automated system based on the simultaneous computational analysis of accelerometry and HR signals to identify PA patterns , employing pattern recognition and machine learning methodologies . 66 5 . State of the art 5 . 2 Automated PA monitoring and recognition This section overviews and summarizes the state of the art concerning published method - ologies to address the automated extraction of high - level information about PA from ac - celerometry signals , with particular focus on those based in the use of machine learning ( ML ) solutions . In broad terms , there are two predominant perspectives : a ) estimating PA - induced energy expenditures ( PAEE ) , and b ) classifying activity patterns to recognize speciﬁc activities from a predeﬁned , ﬁxed set of PA options under consideration . A third type of approaches would consist in the activity - independent stratiﬁcation of PA according to its intensity level , although this research topic has received notably less attention from the automated signal processing and pattern recognition communities . 5 . 2 . 1 Activity - speciﬁc recognition This family of approaches commence by specifying a closed set of target activities , among which authors aim to discern . In literature , those activities often encompass body postures – most typically lying , sitting and standing – and / or transition events between pairs of pos - tures . Other frequent choices include a range of common free - living , spontaneous PAs and sports such as walking , jogging or cycling ; but also sometimes rowing or Nordic walking , for example . A notable variety of ML - based schemes have been proposed in literature for the recognition of PAs , the vast majority of which match the general framework outlined by Preece et al . [ 2009b ] ’s review , where authors presented the following pipeline of stages : a ) Division of the signals into small time segments known as windows ( generally with constant duration ) b ) Feature generation to describe the characteristics and morphology of the captured signals . Diﬀerent types of features can be proposed , such as : time - domain statistics , spectral descriptors based on frequency analyses or wavelet transformations , plus ad hoc features devised to incorporate prior knowledge c ) Dimensionality reduction methods aiming to extract the most relevant fraction of information contained in the departure high - dimensional feature spaces d ) Classiﬁcation algorithms to generate appropriate correspondences between data pat - terns and ground truth PA class assignments . Nevertheless , solutions available in literature employed remarkably diverse strategies for each of the stages mentioned above , as well as in terms of how many and which sensors were used for data collection , or in the set of targeted activities for recognition . These assorted diﬀerences discourage notably ( or prevent altogether ) the establishment of direct comparison of performance among methods . Of note , the mathematical complexity of the ML algorithms for the ﬁnal classiﬁcation stage is remarkably dissimilar , ranging from rela - tively simple ‘nearest neighbours’ strategies ( e . g . [ Bao and Intille , 2004 ] ) to notably more elaborated ensembles of classiﬁers ( e . g . [ Lester et al . , 2006 ] ) . Some authors proposed ad hoc decision schemes which they built on the basis of prior knowledge . For example , Bonomi et al . [ 2009 ] used an intuitive decision structure to dis - tinguish among seven body postures and activities . In that work , decisions were made by means of time - domain statistical descriptors calculated from the accelerometry signal , which was in turn captured with a triaxial sensor device placed in the subject’s lower back . 67 5 . 2 . Automated PA monitoring and recognition Similarly , He et al . [ 2007 ] utilized an array of three accelerometers worn on chest and both thighs to discern among three stable postures – lie , sit or stand – plus ﬁve posture transitions . States were classiﬁed by means of an ad hoc decision scheme which operated by thresh - olding at each decision node ; whereas a hidden Markov model ( HMM ) was subsequently applied to account for temporal information . Besides , Ermes et al . [ 2008 ] recognized nine PAs , including vigorous exercises like cycling , rowing , Nordic walking or football . Subjects wore two triaxial accelerometers on wrist and hip , plus a GPS device to measure the ve - locity of outdoor displacements . Their proposal combined ad hoc intuitive modelling and ML capabilities : ﬁrst , authors employed a priori knowledge to build a decision structure ; whereas for each node , they trained an artiﬁcial neural network in the form of a multi - layer perceptron ( MLP ) to perform binary decisions on the branching at that speciﬁc node . On the contrary , the ample majority of works in literature refrained from assuming any a priori decision ﬂow , making use instead of general - purpose ML classiﬁcation algorithms . For example , Preece et al . [ 2009a ] applied nearest neighbours classiﬁcation on a feature space computed by wavelet analysis ; whereas Siirtola et al . [ 2009 ] employed C4 . 5 decision trees trained for the recognition of nine heterogeneous sport activities ( including e . g . skat - ing or racket sports ) , which operate on accelerometry data recorded by a wrist - worn biaxial sensor . Besides , de Vries et al . [ 2011 ] proposed a MLP classiﬁer with a standard architec - ture , formed by a single layer of hidden neurons . This MLP distinguished sitting , standing , stair climbing , walking and cycling on the basis of measurements coming from two uniaxial accelerometers which were worn on hip and ankle . In addition , Lau et al . [ 2008 ] explored support vector machines ( SVMs ) with data from two biaxial accelerometers and two gyro - scopes – placed on shank and foot – to detect ﬁve diﬀerent walking patterns . Compound ML schemes , also known as meta - classiﬁers , have also been explored in the form of ensembles of ‘weak’ ( i . e . basic ) learners [ Lester et al . , 2005 , 2006 ; Casale et al . , 2011 ] . In particular , Lester et al . [ 2005 , 2006 ] used Boosting on a dataset which merged information collected by an uniaxial accelerometer , plus a microphone , digital compass , barometer thermometer and photodetector . In this manner , authors discerned between sitting , standing , walking on a ﬂat surface or up - / downstairs , using an elevator and teeth - brushing . Additionally , Casale et al . [ 2011 ] used an ensemble of decision trees named ‘random forest’ restricting data collection to accelerometry measurements only . Unsupervised clustering techniques have also been explored by a number of researchers , including Gaussian mixture models ( GMMs ) [ Allen et al . , 2006 ; Nguyen et al . , 2007 ] , and self - organizing maps ( SOMs ) [ Krause et al . , 2003 ] . Interestingly , Bao and Intille [ 2004 ] ; Gyllensten and Bonomi [ 2011 ] compared classiﬁcation performances achieved by various ML algorithms : nearest neighbours , versus naïve Bayes ( NB ) classiﬁers and C4 . 5 decision trees for Bao and Intille [ 2004 ] ; C4 . 5 trees versus MLPs and SVMs in Gyllensten and Bonomi [ 2011 ] . However , given the disparity of results , gen - eral conclusions about an hypothetically superior performance by any speciﬁc ML method cannot be drawn . Furthermore , Bao and Intille [ 2004 ] also studied the suitability of ﬁve diﬀerent body locations where to place their biaxial accelerometry sensors , namely : hip , wrist , arm , ankle and thigh ) . The eﬀect of location on recognition performance was ad - dressed , concluding that accuracy did not suﬀer severe deteriorations when the classiﬁers used only data from wrist and thigh . On the other side , the simultaneous combination of accelerometry and HR continues to be an under - explored option . Munguia Tapia et al . [ 2007 ] evaluated this possibility , although counter - intuitively , authors discarded to include the HR signal since it did not provide suﬃ - 68 5 . State of the art ciently satisfactory increases in recognition performances as achieved by their C4 . 5 decision trees and naïve Bayes classiﬁers . On the contrary , notorious success was reported by Reiss and Stricker [ 2013 ] ; Li et al . [ 2010 ] . Li et al . [ 2010 ] accurately recognized three conglom - erates of postures and activities using signals from an electrocardiogram ( ECG ) device to capture cardiac information , plus three triaxial accelerometers – worn on wrist , waist and ankle – ; whereas patterns were classiﬁed by means of a SVM . Similarly , Liu et al . [ 2012 ] successfully integrated accelerometry with ventilation rate information , as an indicator of the physiological response by the cardiorespiratory system to exercise ; recognizing up to 13 activities with notable accuracy . 5 . 2 . 2 Estimation of energy expenditures A minority of the published methods to estimate PAEE use ML - based solutions [ Bassett et al . , 2012 ] . Instead , linear – or less frequently , non - linear [ Crouter et al . , 2006 ] – regression equations were derived from experimental data . Those regression formulae tend to operate on accelerometry measurements – in particular , activity counts – plus on anthropometric magnitudes , such as sex , age and / or body weight . The overall accuracy of the resulting PAEE estimation is reported to be strongly dependent on the particular activities being monitored [ Crouter et al . , 2006 ; Plasqui and Westerterp , 2007 ; Lyden et al . , 2010 ; Altini et al . , 2015 ] , since the mechanics of movement for each speciﬁc PA can greatly inﬂuence the output in terms of counts up to a large extent . In addition , other ad hoc regression schemes incorporated HR information [ Brage et al . , 2004 ; Strath et al . , 2001 , 2002 , 2005 ] with reasonable success . Among the methods employing ML - based approaches for PAEE estimation , the algorithm which has gained most attention and spread is the MLP neural net working as a non - linear regression system ; although other less frequent options also exist , such as cross - sectional time series models adding HR information [ Zakeri et al . , 2008 ] . Rothney et al . [ 2007 ] applied a MLP on data captured by a biaxial accelerometer which was worn on hip . Authors produced minute - by - minute PAEE estimations , comparing their results versus ground truth measurements obtained in a direct calorimetry chamber . In addition , Staudenmayer et al . [ 2009 ] used their MLP to predict MET values on the basis of data from an ActiGraph ( ActiGraph , USA ) uniaxial accelerometry device . Authors trained another MLP network to function as an activity - speciﬁc classiﬁer , in which four PA groups ( sedentary , household or locomotion activities , plus vigorous PA ) were distinguished . Both Freedson et al . [ 2011 ] ; Trost et al . [ 2012 ] followed very similar strategies to Staudenmayer et al . [ 2009 ] : MLP - based MET regression from ActiGraph uniaxial accelerometry data , along with activity - speciﬁc recognition . As a novelty , these two works addressed the stratiﬁcation of PA into intensity levels in accordance to their resulting MET predictions [ Freedson et al . , 2011 ; Trost et al . , 2012 ] . On the other hand , an increasingly extended approach consists in a two - stage procedure : in the ﬁrst place , an activity - speciﬁc recognition is carried out , subsequently followed by PAEE estimators tuned ad hoc for each particular PA class . For example , Albinali et al . [ 2010 ] conduced an activity - speciﬁc recognition of 25 PAs via C4 . 5 decision trees , which worked on the combination of data from three accelerometers . For PAEE estimation , authors evalu - ated both MET look - up tables and activity - dependent regression models . Similarly , Atallah et al . [ 2011 ] considered eleven lifestyle and sport activities for PAEE prediction , evaluated both in a task - known and a task - blind scenarios . The latter case made use of Boosting classiﬁcation schemes for a preliminary PA recognition . Besides , Altini et al . [ 2015 ] used ﬁve accelerometers – worn on chest , ankle , thigh , wrist and waist – for their capture of data . 69 5 . 2 . Automated PA monitoring and recognition Authors compared the accuracy of PAEE estimations as obtained by standard count - based regression formulae versus schemes combining : a ) activity recognition algorithms , in this case via a SVM , which achieved high accuracies in the discernment of ﬁve aggregated PA groups ) ; and on the other hand , b ) activity - speciﬁc MET estimators , either by MET look - up correspondences or by linear regressions . Similarly , Liu et al . [ 2011 , 2012 ] considered four activity groups – loosely related to PA intensity – , SVM classiﬁcation and subsequent MET predictions by support vector regression ( SVR ) . Authors combined signals from two triaxial accelerometers plus a ventilation rate monitor . Lin et al . [ 2012 ] grouped PAs into three intensity range - based groups and employed data from three triaxial accelerometers , plus an ECG sensor to obtain HR - related information . Authors performed activity recog - nition via decision trees ; whereas the subsequent activity group - dependent MET regression was carried out by means of artiﬁcial neural networks . 5 . 2 . 3 Activity - independent PA intensity classiﬁcation Non - ML - based approaches , which are the largely predominant solution for this task of PA intensity classiﬁcation , rely on the application of thresholds on activity counts , also known as in the ﬁeld as ‘cutpoints’ [ Freedson et al . , 1998 ; Hendelman et al . , 2000 ; Swartz et al . , 2000 ; Ham et al . , 2007 ; Sasaki et al . , 2011 ] . Therefore , the separation of intensity levels based on activity counts is performed in a simple and static manner , although most cer - tainly oversimpliﬁed and not robust . Anyway , such cutpoint - based approach is the option implemented by the companion analysis software for two of the most commonly used com - mercial devices : ActiGraph’s waist - worn sensors [ ActiGraph LLC , 2010 ] and BodyMedia’s SenseWear armband [ Liden et al . , 2002 ; Jakicic et al . , 2004 ; Malavolti et al . , 2007 ; Benito et al . , 2011 ] . On the other hand , this problem of activity - independent PA intensity classiﬁcation has attracted limited attention from the ML research community . Literature available in this regard is scarce . Freedson et al . [ 2011 ] ; Trost et al . [ 2012 ] developed MLP - based MET re - gression schemes which subsequently assigned activities into a certain intensity level in ac - cordance to MET estimation outputs . In a complementary manner , chapter 6 now presents a novel approach explicitly conceived to identify PA time periods on the basis of their re - lated intensity level ( as well as the predominant exercise typology ) , as a core contribution of this PhD thesis work . 70 Chapter 6 Automatic physical activity intensity and modality classiﬁcation using accelerometry and heart rate data 6 . 1 Motivation The promotion of physically active lifestyles is essential for the prevention and / or the treatment and management of a wide variety of chronic diseases with large prevalence and impact on public health , e . g . obesity [ Shaw et al . , 1996 ; Fogelholm , 2010 ] , T2D [ Albright et al . , 2000 ; Thompson et al . , 2003 ; Colberg et al . , 2010 ] , cardiovascular [ Thompson et al . , 2003 ] and respiratory diseases [ Chavannes et al . , 2002 ] , hypertension , cancer [ Lee , 2003 ; Holmes , 2005 ] or depression , among others . In this regard , a reliable automated detection and quantiﬁcation of PA , along with its evolution over time , can empower lifestyle inter - ventions on populations by facilitating , among other aspects : the recording and analysis of data about exercise sessions , the monitoring of patients’ compliance with prescribed PA plans , or the provision of enhanced and individually tailored feedback to patients and caregivers . Thus , PA - based lifestyle interventions demand robust , accurate and scalable automatic mechanisms to monitor patients’ degree of adherence to PA , as well as to as - sess how intensely PA was performed . Furthermore , in the particular application scenario of T1D , distinguishing not only PA intensity but also exercise modality may be of major interest , since diﬀerent modalities induce remarkably distinct acute responses in glycaemia ( sections 4 . 2 – 4 . 3 ) . As a consequence , the adjustment and personalization of therapeutic strategies for the daily self - management of non - sedentary patients with T1D may strongly beneﬁt from objective information about PA intensity and modality . This should also be the case for automated closed - loop glycaemia control scenarios incorporating PA [ Chassin et al . , 2007 ; Breton , 2008 ; van Bon et al . , 2011 ] . As discussed in section 5 . 1 , ‘gold standard’ techniques to quantify PA – i . e . DLW and indirect calorimetry – are costly , not scalable to large populations and suitable only for lab - oratory environments [ Ainslie et al . , 2003 ] . Conversely , this PhD thesis work explores the simultaneous combination of accelerometry and HR information sources , addressing the suitability of a number of ML schemes for the robust identiﬁcation of PA . In particular , the schemes under study here were designed to discern between three standard PA inten - sity levels [ Pate , 1995 ] : i ) rest , sedentary and low intensity situations ( below 3 MET ) , ii ) moderate PA ( 3 – 6 MET ) , and iii ) vigorous exercise ( above 6 MET ) . Additionally , for vig - 71 6 . 2 .

In addition , ActiGraph’s pedometer functionality [ Le Masurier and Tudor - Locke , 2003 ] was also utilized . As other comparable commercial accelerometers speciﬁcally dedicated for PA monitoring , the ActiTrainer device produces its output measurements in the form of ‘activity counts’ over a epoch with conﬁgurable duration [ ActiGraph LLC , 2010 ] . During the experiments , participants wore the ActiTrainer biaxial accelerometer ( 86 × 33 × 15 mm size , 51 g weight , ± 3G dynamic range , 30 Hz sampling frequency ) tightly attached to their waist , with main and secondary axes oriented in respectively vertical and antero - posterior directions , as suggested by manufacturer’s guidelines [ ActiGraph LLC , 2010 ] . For the HR signals to be handled appropriately , ActiTrainer’s ﬁrmware imposed a minimum epoch with duration 10 s , which was the choice here in order to have as much temporal resolution as possible . 6 . 2 . 2 Data collection experiments The ML - based identiﬁcation of PA patterns relies on the automated extraction of knowledge from the provided ground truth dataset . Therefore , reference data should be representa - tive of those expected to be encountered in the ﬁnal intended application . Consequently , two distinct data collection experiments were conduced here , aiming at the construction 72 6 . PA intensity and modality classiﬁcation using accelerometry and HR of a thorough , descriptive reference dataset which reﬂects the heterogeneity of PAs which may take place in practise . One of these two experiments ( A ) covered free - living condi - tions in ambulatory scenarios , whereas he other was carried out in a controlled laboratory environment ( B ) . 6 . 2 . 2 . 1 Experiment A Experiment A enrolled seven healthy subjects : 3 males and 4 females , with age range 25 – 43 years old and diverse lifestyles varying from sedentary to regular sports practice . Volunteers received instructions on how to wear the sensors and were requested to produce written activity logs with as much detail as possible , including both timing information and intensity descriptions . Subjects were encouraged to record : i ) daily life situations , ii ) the use of means of transportation , as well as iii ) their preferred PAs at self - selected intensities . 6 . 2 . 2 . 2 Experiment B Experiment B took place in a ﬁtness center , under strict timing control and direct super - vision by the research team . Three alternative types of circuit were considered ( Figures 6 . 2 to 6 . 4 ) . Circuits # 1 ( Figure 6 . 2 ) and # 2 ( Figure 6 . 3 ) comprised upper - and lower - limb resistance exercise – i . e . strength training – , respectively with free weights and ﬁtness ma - chines ( Johnson Health Tech Iberica , Spain ) . oppositely , circuit # 3 ( Figure 6 . 4 ) combined free weights and aerobic exercise – i . e . treadmill running – performed in short alternating bouts . Each 64 - min session ( Figure 6 . 5 ) started with a 5 - min warm - up phase – treadmill or elliptical walk – plus a preliminary circuit lap with duration 7 min 45 s and light load : at 30 % of each subject’s 15 repetitions maximum ( RM ) . Thereafter , three more circuit laps were performed with high load : at i . e . 70 % of 15 RM . Laps were separated by 5 min ‘active recovery’ periods – i . e . walking – . A complete description of exercises , circuits and protocols can be found elsewhere [ Benito Peinado et al . , 2010 ; Zapico et al . , 2012 ] : PRONAF study ( trial registration NCT01116856 at ClinicalTrials . gov ) . Nine subjects took part : 6 males and 3 females , with an age range 20 – 49 years old . Three were healthy , moderately active males , whereas the remaining six individuals suﬀered mod - erate overweight ( BMI = 28 . 1 ± 1 . 3 kg · m − 2 , mean ± SD ) . Informed consent was obtained in all cases . Along with the ActiTrainer accelerometer and a Polar HR monitor , participants wore a SenseWear armband ( BodyMedia , USA ) [ Liden et al . , 2002 ; Malavolti et al . , 2007 ] on their dominant arm ; as well as a Jaeger Oxycon Mobile ( CareFusion , USA ) portable indirect calorimeter ( Figure 6 . 6 ) to measure PAEE via O 2 consumption and C 02 production rates . However , PAEE data were not employed in this work ; but instead served to evaluate the accuracy of ActiTrainer’s and SenseWear’s EE estimation formulae in strength training scenarios 1 . 6 . 2 . 2 . 3 Dataset overview A heterogeneous set of free - living activities in ambulatory scenarios was acquired during Exp . A . This included daily life situations – e . g . sleeping , household or oﬃce work – and 1 Artic le submitted by the PRONAF research team , approval pending . 73 6 . 2 . Data collection experiments Figure 6 . 2 : Schematic depiction of PRONAF circuit # 1 . Each of the three 7 min 45 s circuit laps ( actually four , considering the preliminary warm - up lap at a lighter intensity ) comprised eight stages of 45 s duration each , with 15 s in between for transitions . At each stage , subjects performed 15 repetitions at a ﬁxed cadence : 1 s concentric phase , 2 s eccen - tric phase [ Zapico et al . , 2012 ] . Loads were calculated to represent 70 % of each subject’s 15 RM , except for the warm - up lap , where they were 30 % of 15 RM [ Benito Peinado et al . , 2010 ] . Stages for circuit # 1 were in this order : shoulder press , squat , barber row , lateral split , bench press , front split , biceps curl and French press for triceps .

Diﬀerences with respect to # 1 resided in the selected exercise routines , where each exercise had similar characteristics to the corresponding stage in circuit # 1 , but performed with ﬁtness machines in this case : shoulder press with machine , ‘hack’ squat , Gironda chest row , leg press , bench press with machine , lying leg extension , Scott bench biceps curl and triceps pull down .

Diﬀerences with circuits # 1 and # 2 again consisted in the routines at each stage : on the one side , exercises two , four , six and eight comprised 45 s treadmill running ; whereas stages one , three , ﬁve and seven corresponded to free - weight strength exercises : squat , Gironda chest row , bench press and front split .

Additionally , ﬁgures show Oxycon’s face mask and other equipment – worn on chest – as needed for the portable indirect calorimeter . the use of means of transportation – speciﬁcally bus , car , subway and elevator – , along with a notable variety of exercises at assorted intensities , including : walking at diﬀerent paces , dancing , jogging , vigorous endurance running , karate , football ( soccer ) and mountain bike . The elimination of ambiguously annotated periods yielded a total of 148 . 50 h of usable data , split in 72 sessions ( Table 6 . 1 , upper part ) . Session duration was 119 [ 93 – 149 ] min ( median [ inter - quartile range ] ) , with minimum at 18 min and maximum at 216 min . The detailed distribution regarding the volumes of data per individual is depicted in Figure 6 . 7 ( panel A ) , with median time per participant at 10 . 40 h . Of note , the subject with identiﬁcation code # A7 contributed with only 18 min ; whereas on the contrary , subject # A5 – a moderately active , 26 - year - old male – was very enthusiastic and participative in the data collection procedure and contributed with a total of 81 . 87 h . In contrast , Exp . B in a controlled laboratory environment was markedly more homoge - neous than Exp . A in terms of exercise activities covered . Diﬀerences in the volumes of data for each subject ( Figure 6 . 7 , panel B ) had two sources : • The number of sessions in which each volunteer participated , which depended on his / her availability for the experiment . Five overweight individuals ( subjects with identiﬁcation codes # B4 to # B7 , plus subject # B9 ) completed all three circuit ver - sions in diﬀerent days and random order ; whereas one healthy subject ( # B1 ) exercised for two sessions , and the remaining three participants ( two healthy males # B2 , # B3 and one overweight female # B8 ) completed only one circuit ; randomly assigned in all cases . Hence , a total of 20 sessions were registered . • The pre - and post - exercise resting time which was recorded in addition to the 64 - min circuit protocol . 78 6 .

Data were manually divided into separate PA intensity classes by MET levels according to Ainsworth et al . [ 2000 ] ’s Compendium . Three standard intensity ranges [ Pate , 1995 ] were employed , namely : i ) low - intensity activities below 3 MET – which therefore include sedentary situations – , ii ) moderate PA ( 3 – 6 MET ) , and iii ) vigorous exercise ( > 6 MET ) . Additionally , 17 . 00 h of vigorous PA data included further information regarding the exer - cise modality involved ( Table 6 . 1 , lower part ) : either sustained aerobic , mixed or resistance activity – i . e . strength / weight training – . 6 . 3 Algorithms This PhD thesis work proposes a pipeline of ML algorithms which broadly corresponds to the steps outlined by Preece et al . [ 2009b ] ’s review on activity - speciﬁc PA recognition methods . In addition , major novelties with respect to the procedures described in [ Preece et al . , 2009b ] include : i ) the use of unsupervised clustering techniques for pattern ex - traction and vector quantization [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] ; and ii ) a ﬁnal Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) as an extra temporal ﬁltering module , which exploits time redundancy in the data series in order to enhance robustness in classiﬁcation . 79 6 . 3 . Algorithms 6 . 3 . 1 Preprocessing and feature deﬁnition The multi - modal signals captured by the ActiTrainer biaxial accelerometer were : a ) activ - ity counts for its main and secondary axes a 1 , a 2 , b ) step count st – pedometer functionality – , and c ) heart rate data hr , as measured and transmitted by the Polar Wearlink chest strap . Signals were ﬁrst divided in non - overlapping analysis windows with duration equal to 2 min ( N = 12 epochs per window , at 10 s per epoch ) . Several alternative window lengths were tested in a preliminary stage , where these 2 min were found to be a satisfactory trade - oﬀ between : on the one side a ) capturing information - rich patterns in the signals – task for which longer analysis segments would be desirable – ; and on the other hand b ) suﬃcient temporal resolution – i . e . low time granularity – , which would imply short windows . Additionally , activity counts in both the main and secondary axes a 1 , a 2 were combined into an extra magnitude called here ‘pseudo - norm’ activity counts a pn deﬁned as : a pn = q a 21 + a 22 ( 6 . 1 ) For each window and each of the ﬁve signals under consideration ( a 1 , a 2 , a pn , st and hr ) , the following time - domain statistical descriptors were computed : • Mean ¯ x and standard deviation sd x : ¯ x = 1 N N X i = 1 x ( t i ) ( 6 . 2 ) sd x = v u ut 1 N − 1 N X i = 1 [ x ( t i ) − ¯ x ] 2 ( 6 . 3 ) where x ( t ) represents a generic signal sampled at instants t i . • Diﬀerence between mean ¯ x versus median x med values : mmd x = ¯ x − x med ( 6 . 4 ) a feature which was devised in order to contribute in the protection against outliers , because medians are less sensitive to outliers than means . • Maximum , minimum value and total range : x max = max i = 1 , . . . , N x ( t i ) ( 6 . 5 ) x min = min i = 1 , . . . , N x ( t i ) ( 6 . 6 ) x range = x max − x min ( 6 . 7 ) where x min is exclusively used in the subsequent computation of x range but not in the ﬁnal feature space , since preliminary tests revealed its low discriminative power . • Signal variability sv x within a certain window , defned here as the accumulation of absolute diﬀerences between a certain sample x ( t i ) of signal x at time t i and its previous value : sv x = N X i = 2 | x ( t i ) − x ( t i − 1 ) | ( 6 . 8 ) • A coeﬃcient of dispersion cd x with respect to the median value x med of the signal within the window : cd x = ( 1 N P Ni = 1 | x ( t i ) − x med | x med if x med 6 = 0 0 otherwise ( 6 . 9 ) 80 6 . PA intensity and modality classiﬁcation using accelerometry and HR Nonetheless , after visual inspection and preliminary tests , a modiﬁed version of cd x was used instead : more speciﬁcally , exponentiated by a constant γ , where γ was heuristically assigned to 1 / 4 in order to increase the spread of values obtained for this modiﬁed dispersion feature cd γx with respect to cd x . In addition , it was observed that features computed from acceleration counts – i . e . those statistics derived from signals a 1 , a 2 and a pn ; but neither from st , nor from hr – yielded values which spanned through various orders of magnitude , an issue which could pose a major challenge to the subsequent learning algorithms , specially to those based on dis - tances between data instances . Consequently , the following truncated signed logarithmic transformation was applied to those features , as suggested by Zumel and Mount [ 2014 ] : sign log ( x ) = ( sign ( x ) log | x | if | x | ≥ 1 0 otherwise ( 6 . 10 ) where : a ) sign considerations were necessary to accommodate negative feature values , which – given the aforementioned deﬁnitions of features and taking into account that a 1 , a 2 are per se non - negative natural numbers ( integers ) – could only arise in those features concerning mean - median diﬀerences ; and b ) this signed log - transformation was not applied to the exponentiated coeﬃcients of dispersion cd γx , since those feature did not suﬀer the scale problems described above . Finally , other extra ad hoc features were deﬁned : • Three paired products between mean ‘pseudo - norm’ counts a pn ( log - transformed ) , mean HR and mean number of steps , along with the combined product of the three former magnitudes , i . e . : hr · sign log ( ¯ a pn ) ( 6 . 11 ) st · sign log ( ¯ a pn ) ( 6 . 12 ) hr · st ( 6 . 13 ) hr · st · sign log ( ¯ a pn ) ( 6 . 14 ) In this manner , multi - modal information captured by the device was merged explic - itly . • Histogram of counts for the main axis a 1 , where ActiGraph default cutpoints – i . e . 1952 and 5725 counts [ Freedson et al . , 1998 ; ActiGraph LLC , 2010 ] – were used as a reference for setting binning intervals in the histogram . More precisely , those Acti - Graph default cutpoints were ﬁrst rescaled by a proportionality factor equal to 1 / 6 in order to adapt them to the use of 10 s epochs , instead of the original 60 s epochs employed in the original work by Freedson et al . [ 1998 ] . Therefore , these ad hoc histogram features are inspired in the replication of the standard , threshold - based intensity classiﬁcation procedure implemented in ActiGraph’s commercial analysis software [ ActiGraph LLC , 2010 ] . In total , 42 time - domain features were computed : 7 statistical descriptors for each of the 5 signals under consideration , plus 4 combined products ( 6 . 11 ) – ( 6 . 11 ) and 3 cutpoint - based features 2 . 6 . 3 . 2 Dimensionality reduction This works explores diﬀerent techniques whose aim is to retain as much information from the original high - dimensional feature space as possible , while reducing the number of variables 2 T wo cutpoints deﬁne three histogram intervals . 81 6 . 3 . Algorithms and hence the complexity of the subsequent automated learning task . In this manner , unnecessary redundancy ( as well as to some extent , also noise ) becomes cancelled out from the dataset , which is in turn transformed to have fewer features , although more descriptive and information - rich . Nevertheless , prior to the dimensionality reduction stage itself and given that the features used here are clearly not commensurate ( in ﬁrst place , because their units are diﬀerent ) , the feature space was standardized : ﬁrst subtracting the sample mean in each dimension , and later normalizing by its standard deviation . Besides , this step prevented relevant informa - tion contained in the low - scaled features from being shaded by variables with high variance , an aspect which is specially critical when applying distance - based learning schemes , e . g . K - means , hierarchical clustering or SVMs . 6 . 3 . 2 . 1 Feature extraction These dimensionality reduction procedures consist in obtaining a series of new features computed as linear combinations of the original ones , in such a manner that those new features cover most of the relevant information in data . In turn , there exist diﬀerent criteria about what to consider relevant information . 6 . 3 . 2 . 1 . 1 Principal Component Analysis Principal component analysis ( PCA ) projects data onto a vector subspace deﬁned to pre - serve as much randomness as possible from the original high - dimensional feature space . Such a subspace is speciﬁed by the eigenvectors with largest eigenvalues from data’s covari - ance matrix ( appendix A . 1 . 1 ) . Anyway , given the pre - standardization step , this covariance matrix coincides with the correlation matrix of the original – i . e . untransformed – data features [ Rencher and Christensen , 2012 ] . 6 . 3 . 2 . 1 . 2 Linear Discriminant Analysis Linear discriminant analysis ( LDA ) is a procedure conceived to preserve as much of the class discriminatory information as possible once data have been projected . Consequently , LDA requires information about ground truth class assignments ; in contrast to PCA , which is an unsupervised algorithm . Mathematically speaking , the core of the LDA algorithm ( appendix A . 1 . 2 ) resides in solving a generalized eigenvalue problem where the within - and between - class scatter matrices are indicators of class separability [ Rencher and Christensen , 2012 ] . In general , the dimensionality of LDA’s output subspace equals the number of classes under consideration minus one . 6 . 3 . 2 . 2 Feature selection As seen above , feature extraction approaches ( e . g . PCA or LDA ) reduce data dimension - ality via the generation of new characteristics as an appropriately weighted linear combi - nation of the original . Instead , feature selection methodologies search for a suitable subset of features which retains relevant information in accordance to certain optimality crite - rion [ Kohavi and John , 1997 ; Guyon and Elisseeﬀ , 2003 ] . These techniques have therefore an advantage over feature extraction in terms of the interpretability of resulting features , which in practice becomes very limited after PCA or LDA linear combinations . In addition , unselected features would not need to be calculated for an eventual ﬁnal deployment of the classiﬁer . 82 6 . PA intensity and modality classiﬁcation using accelerometry and HR 6 . 3 . 2 . 2 . 1 Filters These procedures consist in selecting features according to their respective ability to maxi - mize a certain target or merit function , in turn deﬁned to quantify the appropriateness of the candidate feature subset following criteria stemming from information theory . This work employed merit functions corresponding to the so - called minimum redundancy - maximum relevance ( mRMR ) criterion , as formulated by Peng et al . [ 2005 ] ; Ding and Peng [ 2005 ] . At each iteration , one feature is selected – i . e . ‘ﬁltered’ – in a greedy near - optimal [ Peng et al . , 2005 ] manner to optimize the trade - oﬀ between : a ) Additional information supplied by the inclusion of the new candidate feature , i . e . maximizing the relevance of the feature set ; and b ) Redundancy existing between the new candidate feature and those already selected , with the objective of minimizing the overall redundancy . As speciﬁed by [ Ding and Peng , 2005 ] , the mRMR ﬁlter , in its variant for discrete – i . e . categorical – data , uses mutual information I ( x , y ) between features x , y as part of both its relevance and redundancy criteria , where : I ( x , y ) = X i X j p ( x i , y j ) log p ( x i , y j ) p ( x i ) p ( y j ) ( 6 . 15 ) being p ( x i ) , p ( y j ) the marginal frequentist probabilities for each possible discrete value x i , y j , and p ( x i , y j ) their joint probability . On the other hand , for the version of mRMR operating on continuous data : • Relevance of feature x is determined by the F - test statistic : F ( x , c ) = 1 σ 2 1 C − 1 C X c = 1 n c ( ¯ x c − ¯ x ) 2 ( 6 . 16 ) where the problem consists of C classes under consideration and where σ 2 is the overall variance across the dataset : σ 2 = 1 n − C C X c = 1 ( n c − 1 ) σ 2 c ( 6 . 17 ) being ¯ x the overall mean across data instances ; n c , ¯ x c , σ 2 c respectively the number of samples in the c - th class , its within - class mean and variance ; and n the total number of samples available in the dataset . • Redundancy is calculated as the average of the absolute values of Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcients | ρ x , y | between pairs of features x , y [ Ding and Peng , 2005 ] . To evaluate the balance between relevance and redundancy , and in order to rank features in relation to such trade - oﬀ , this work employs the mutual information quotient ( MIQ ) and F - test correlation quotient ( FCQ ) metrics , as suggested by Ding and Peng [ 2005 ] . In addition , given that all of the features used here are continuous variables instead of discrete / categorical data , it was compulsory to perform a quantization of values before ap - plying the discrete version of the mRMR ﬁlter procedure . This quantization was carried out by binning each feature into eight intervals symmetrically placed around its sample mean , with interval widths equal to half of the sample standard deviation . In the standardized feature space , such a deﬁnition of binning intervals is equivalent to use the following ranges : ( −∞ , − 3 / 2 ) ; [ − 3 / 2 , − 1 ) ; [ − 1 , − 1 / 2 ) ; [ − 1 / 2 , 0 ) ; [ 0 , 1 / 2 ) ; [ 1 / 2 , 1 ) ; [ 1 , 3 / 2 ) and [ 3 / 2 , + ∞ ) . 83 6 . 3 . Algorithms 6 . 3 . 2 . 2 . 2 Wrappers The essential diﬀerence between ‘ﬁlter’ - and ‘wrapper’ - based feature extraction procedures lies in their optimality metrics : ﬁlters target at a goal function grounded on informa - tion theory measures , whereas wrappers focus on maximizing the recognition performance achieved by a certain classiﬁcation algorithm embedded in the process – i . e . ‘wrapped’ , hence their name – [ Kohavi and John , 1997 ; Guyon and Elisseeﬀ , 2003 ] . In general , an important advantage of this ‘wrapper’ - based feature selection consists in the fact that its optimization metric is more closely related to the ﬁnal use of the system for classiﬁcation purposes than information theory measures . On the other hand , estimations about the classiﬁcation accuracy achieved by the wrapped classiﬁers should be assessed by cross - validation ( CV ) schemes in order to prevent – or at least to ameliorate – overﬁtting . Coming sections 6 . 3 . 3 . 2 and 6 . 3 . 5 respectively describe in more detail the classiﬁcation algorithms being wrapped here and the custom performance metric employed . Concerning the strategy to explore the search space of candidate feature subsets , it is straightforward to conclude that , in practise , exhaustive search becomes infeasible very rapidly because the cardinality of possible sets grows exponentially with the number of features : for d features , there exist 2 d candidate sets . Thus , heuristic search algorithms are needed . This work explored two diﬀerent approaches with considerably unequal computa - tional demand , namely : • Greedy best - ﬁrst forward sequential search . Starting from an empty set , one feature gets added to this candidate set at each iteration ; speciﬁcally the one which most improves the performance of the wrapped classiﬁer . This procedure is repeated iter - atively until noticeable increases in performance do not longer occur in spite of the eventual addition of extra – most likely , redundant – features . • Genetic search . This approach consists in a stochastic search strategy inspired by biological evolutionary procedures . A random initial collection – named ‘population’ – of tentative candidate solutions – i . e . ‘individuals’ – are evaluated according to a cer - tain ﬁtness function , which in this case corresponds to the classiﬁcation performance as attained by the ‘wrapped’ classiﬁer when trained on the dataset with reduced features . In turn , this ﬁtness score establishes the probability of survival [ Goldberg , 1989 ] for each individual solution within the population towards the following iteration – i . e . ‘generation’ – . Surviving solutions either experience ‘replication’ – i . e . remaining unchanged – , undergo ‘mutation’ – i . e . small random changes – or suﬀer a ‘cross - over’ operation – i . e . being merged with another candidate solution in order to produce an ‘oﬀspring’ , generally with large changes – . Due to these stochastic alterations , there are occasional major modiﬁcations in the candidates , a characteristic behaviour of genetic search schemes which is highly beneﬁcial when exploring complex optimization spaces ( as it is often the case in feature selection problems [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] ) . In this work , two diﬀerent ‘wrapper’ - based feature selection procedures are conduced for each supervised classiﬁcation algorithm under study here ( i . e . those listed in section 6 . 3 . 3 . 2 ) : one with a greedy best - ﬁrst selection strategy , plus another with genetic search . On the other hand , wrappers tend to produce solutions which may excessively ﬁt the par - ticular ‘wrapped’ scheme employed [ Kohavi and John , 1997 ; Guyon and Elisseeﬀ , 2003 ] . As a consequence , the subset of selected features may potentially suﬀer from a lack of suﬃ - cient generalization power as to apply it practise . For this reason and in order to augment overall generalizability , two extra procedures were conduced : one greedy , one genetic . In them , the performance scores attained by each classiﬁer are averaged to obtain an overall 84 6 . PA intensity and modality classiﬁcation using accelerometry and HR ﬁtness metric , which ultimately guides the features selection . In this manner , the eventual bias in favour of any particular classiﬁer should be unlikely . 6 . 3 . 3 Pattern identiﬁcation This stage forms the core of the ML process , where the underlying informative patterns in data are automatically discovered and extracted for recognition purposes . 6 . 3 . 3 . 1 Clustering In the ﬁrst place , four unsupervised algorithms were explored here . These techniques did not make use of information about ground truth class correspondences . Instead , input data were arranged into homogeneous clusters , which in principle did not correspond directly to the desired classiﬁcation outcomes . Hence , cluster would have lacked of an intuitive interpretation if addressed solely . However , they achieved a ‘smart quantization’ of the data space [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] , and in turn served as the ‘observed’ states for the subsequent HMM - based temporal ﬁltering . 6 . 3 . 3 . 1 . 1 K - means clustering K - means is arguably the most renowned algorithm for clustering purposes . In broad terms , its training procedure consists in an iterative update of cluster centroids in two stages . Centroids partition the data space in multi - dimensional Voronoi areas which determine the correspondence between a given data point and its cluster assignation . See appendix A . 2 . 1 for a formal mathematical description of the K - means methodology . 6 . 3 . 3 . 1 . 2 Gaussian Mixture Models Gaussian Mixture Models ( GMM ) approximate the probability density function of data as a mixture – i . e . as a weighted linear combination – of multidimensional Gaussian distributions , whose parameters – means , covariance matrices and weights – must be estimated during the training stage ( appendix A . 2 . 2 ) . Expectation - maximization ( EM ) algorithms are commonly employed in such parameter estimation procedures . 6 . 3 . 3 . 1 . 3 Hierarchical clustering This work adopted an agglomerative – i . e . bottom - up’ ( appendix A . 2 . 3 ) – approach for hierarchical clustering . A Preliminary tests to select suitable conﬁguration parameters resulted in the choice of Euclidean distance and Ward’s linkage criterion between sub - clusters ( appendix A . 2 . 3 ) as the options providing highest performances . 6 . 3 . 3 . 1 . 4 Self Organizing Maps SOMs are a form of artiﬁcial neural networks whose training is based on competitive learn - ing ( appendix A . 2 . 4 ) . They were used here to map the input feature space onto a 2D grid of neurons . Subsequently , SOM neurons were clustered using a hierarchical approach , which supposed a remarkable decrease in terms of computational load with respect to the former case operating on the whole cloud of data instances . SOM’s network topology ( a hexagonal grid ) and its number of neurons ( 20 × 20 ) were reﬁned preliminarily . Distance metrics between pairs of neurons were computed via Dijkstra’s al - gorithm , with costs corresponding to the Euclidean diﬀerences between grid - adjacent SOM 85 6 . 3 . Algorithms neuron weights . In addition , the ‘average’ linkage criterion was employed for hierarchical clustering . All these parameter choices were made attending to preliminary tests . 6 . 3 . 3 . 2 Classiﬁcation In addition to the four aforementioned clustering approaches , this work studied the suit - ability of ﬁve supervised classiﬁcation algorithms . Training procedures were conduced for each of the data feature spaces under consideration ( i . e . those reduced via PCA , LDA , ﬁlters and wrappers ) , given the ground truth class correspondence assignments . Those ﬁve algorithms allowed to cover a wide spectrum of methodologies with diverse working prin - ciples and varying degrees of computational complexities . Besides , Naïve Bayes classiﬁers ( appendix A . 3 . 1 ) were also explored in a preliminary stage , although they were discarded due to their poor overall classiﬁcation performance . 6 . 3 . 3 . 2 . 1 Logistic regression With this method , the natural logarithms of class - likelihood ratios are modelled as a mul - tivariate linear function of features values , with a diﬀerent set of regression coeﬃcients for each class ( appendix A . 3 . 2 ) . For a deﬁnitive classiﬁcation , the maximum estimated probability value determines the predicted class correspondence . 6 . 3 . 3 . 2 . 2 Multi - Layer Perceptron MLPs count with high popularity among the supervised learning schemes , being widely used in assorted ﬁelds of application . Their working principle resides in building a com - pound , non - linear mapping function by means of the cascade connection of various layers of neurons , whose input weighing factors are appropriately tuned and with a non - linear ac - tivation ( appendix A . 3 . 3 ) . The classical feed - forward MLP architecture – i . e . with a single layer of hidden neurons – was used here ; since it has been proved [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] that this general , although relatively simple network structure can achieve arbitrary complexity provided that suﬃcient neurons are placed on its hidden layer . 6 . 3 . 3 . 2 . 3 Support Vector Machines Support Vector Machines ( SVM ) are maximal - margin classiﬁers based on ﬁnding the opti - mal separation hyperplane – in either the original feature space , or in a transformed version of it via kernel functions ( appendix A . 3 . 4 ) – which divides the space of data in two regions ; fulﬁlling the condition that the distance ( i . e . ‘margin’ ) between this boundary hyperplane and the closest , most limiting samples ( known as ‘supporting vectors’ ) must be as wide as possible . This in turn translates into quadratic optimization problems often solved using Lagrangian formulations ( appendix A . 3 . 4 ) . Gaussian radial - basis function ( RBF ) kernels k ( · , · ) are a common choice for SVMs , where these kernels incorporate distances between data pairs ~ x , ~ x j according to the following formula : k ( ~ x , ~ x j ) = exp (cid:20) − 1 2 σ 2 k ~ x − ~ x j k 2 (cid:21) ( 6 . 18 ) In the case of the dataset under consideration in this work , preliminary explorations showed better classiﬁcation performances for RBF - based SVMs than for the basic linear formula - tion . 86 6 . PA intensity and modality classiﬁcation using accelerometry and HR On the other hand and given that : a ) the original SVM methodology was conceived for binary classiﬁcation only , and considering that b ) the problems addressed here are multi - class ; a one - versus - all ( OVA ) approach was adopted . OVA consisted in generating a series of binary SVMs , each of which speciﬁcally trained to discern between a certain class of interest and all the remaining other . However , OVA brings an extra issue in the form of ‘ties’ , i . e . whenever more than one SVM happens to classify positively a certain input data point ~ x ; or conversely , whenever none does . This work employed posterior SVM probability scores in order to break ties , resolving the prediction outcome for ~ x in correspondence to the class whose SVM yielded highest posterior score for ~ x : postscore SVM ( ~ x ) = n SV X j = 1 α j y j k ( ~ x , ~ x j ) + b ( 6 . 19 ) where : a ) ~ x j are each of the n SV ‘supporting vectors’ , b ) y i ∈ ± 1 are their ground truth class assignments , c ) b is the oﬀset term for the SVM , and ﬁnally d ) α j are the Lagrange multipliers resulting from the training of the SVM [ Vapnik , 1998 ] . 6 . 3 . 3 . 2 . 4 Bagging The Bagging technique is a type of meta - classiﬁcation scheme in which the outcomes pro - duced for a given input by a series of so - called ‘weak’ classiﬁers are averaged in order to obtain an ‘ensembled’ or ‘robust’ classiﬁcation result . The distinctive aspect of Bagging with respect to other meta - classiﬁers lies in the fact that each of those ‘weak’ learners had been trained on a resampled collection of input data , stemming from the original dataset and generated via bootstrap resampling methods ( i . e . random with replacement , appendix A . 3 . 6 ) . In this work’s implementation , classiﬁcation and regression trees ( CART ) were used as ‘weak’ learners . In particular , CART trees had MATLAB’s default conﬁguration parame - ters [ MathWorks Documentation , 2015 ] , including Gini’s diversity index as splitting crite - rion and branch pruning based on classiﬁcation errors ( appendix A . 3 . 5 ) . 6 . 3 . 3 . 2 . 5 Boosting As in the case of Bagging , Boosting works as a meta - classiﬁcation system aggregating ( i . e . ensembling ) ‘weak’ learners , which in this case received a voting weight in accordance to their estimated classiﬁcation accuracy . Therefore , a new weak classiﬁer is trained at each iteration , with augmented focus on those input samples which were misclassiﬁed during the previous step ( appendix A . 3 . 7 ) . Again , CART decision trees were chosen here as the template algorithm for weak learners , using also MATLAB’s default conﬁguration [ MathWorks Documentation , 2015 ] . Besides , this work opted for the AdaBoost . M2 version of the algorithm ( appendix A . 3 . 7 ) in order to address multi - class problems . 6 . 3 . 4 Temporal ﬁltering Various works in literature proposed activity - speciﬁc PA recognition schemes based on the use of Hidden Markov Models ( HMM ) [ Lester et al . , 2006 ; Pober et al . , 2006 ; Chang et al . , 2007 ; He et al . , 2007 ; Mannini and Sabatini , 2011 ] , mainly to detect and characterize tran - sition events between body postures . Conversely , this work uses HMMs from a diﬀerent perspective : as a non - linear informed ﬁltering module , capable of exploiting temporal re - dundancies for the sake of robustness in classiﬁcation . Indeed , this particular scenario of 87 6 . 3 . Algorithms PA monitoring presents a strong temporal coherence ; in other words , a clear time inter - dependency between neighbour windows segments . At the view of data collected during the experiments , it is straightforward to observe that in free - living conditions , the intensity at which PA was performed – as well as its modality – did not tend to vary in a quick , ﬂuctuating manner . Instead , long - term trends were most often maintained stable without changes for periods that in general broadly exceeded the duration of the 2 - min analysis window . To gain beneﬁt from this behaviour , changes in PA intensity and modality were modelled here as a Markovian process ( appendix A . 4 ) , assumption which allowed the use of a HMM ﬁltering approach for classiﬁcation purposes . The information provided by the clustering algorithms was incorporated in the following manner : a ) cluster assignments were treated as the ‘observable’ Markovian process , each cluster being considered an ‘observable symbol’ in HMM terminology ; whereas b ) the ‘hid - den’ process of interest would correspond to those PA classes ( either for PA intensity or modality , this depending on the problem being addressed ) which most likely generated the observed sequence of cluster assignments . Therefore , once the HMM had been trained – i . e . its emission and transition matrices estimated – , the application of Viterbi’s algorithm ( ap - pendix A . 4 ) retrieved the most likely succession of hidden states , which in turn represent the HMM outcomes in terms of the recognition of PA classes . On the other hand , such a HMM ﬁltering procedure would not be strictly necessary in the case of using supervised classiﬁers , since the outcome predictions by those algorithms directly correspond to the target PA classes . Consequently , a translation from clusters to classes as in the former situation is no longer required . Nevertheless , the HMM is still potentially beneﬁcial to help exploit temporal redundancy . Paralleling the approach described above for clusterers , the observable Markov process would now be formed by PA predictions by the classiﬁers , whereas the hidden Markov process would correspond to the ﬁnal – i . e . HMM - ﬁltered – PA recognition . In this manner , this procedure allows to integrate information about temporal trends and correlations from adjacent windows , aspects which cannot be taken into account solely by the classiﬁers from section 6 . 3 . 3 . 2 , since they are general - purpose algorithms designed to treat each input data sample as completely independent and separate from the rest ( i . e . without temporal relationships ) . 6 . 3 . 5 Practical aspects 6 . 3 . 5 . 1 Evaluating classiﬁcation performance and model selection The most frequent way to measure the performance attained by a certain classiﬁcation algorithm is by means of its overall accuracy . However , here it was decided to use a diﬀerent performance metric when selecting the most suitable model , i . e . the combination of dimensionality reduction method plus pattern identiﬁcation scheme which behaved best on these data . The rationale is that accuracy – calculated as the fraction of correctly classiﬁed samples – cannot reﬂect fairly achievements for under - represented classes [ Forman and Scholz , 2010 ] ; an issue which might in turn become critical in this case , due to the marked imbalance of examples representing each PA intensity class in the dataset ( Table 6 . 1 , upper part ) . Instead , this works deﬁnes a custom performance metric as a composite score aggregating : a ) classiﬁcation accuracy , and b ) f - measures for each class under consideration : Score = 1 C + 1 " Accuracy + C X i = 1 f - Measure ( Class i ) # ( 6 . 20 ) 88 6 . PA intensity and modality classiﬁcation using accelerometry and HR where C represents the total number of classes under consideration ( being C = 3 for both the PA intensity and modality problems ) , and where f - measure represents a performance metric commonly used in the ﬁeld of information retrieval [ Forman and Scholz , 2010 ] . More precisely , f - measure is deﬁned as the harmonic mean between : a ) precision – i . e . positive predictive value – , and b ) recall – i . e . sensitivity – : f - Measure = 2 Precision · Recall Precision + Recall ( 6 . 21 ) Precision = TruePos TruePos + FalsePos ( 6 . 22 ) Recall = TruePos TruePos + FalseNeg ( 6 . 23 ) Therefore , by deﬁnition ( 6 . 21 ) f - measure can only reach high values when both precision and recall are simultaneously high . For the sake of reliability in the assessments of performance , a stratiﬁed 10 - fold cross - validation ( CV ) was carried out for PA intensity classiﬁcation , repeating the whole pro - cess n = 30 times in order to ascertain its variability . When allocating data across CV folds , stratiﬁcation was not done on a sample basis , because such procedure would have dismissed any information about temporal redundancy trends underlying in consecutive windows . Instead , a block - based , or sequence - based stratiﬁed cross - validation ( SBSCV ) was implemented : each sequence – i . e . each block of PA data recorded during the same PA session – was randomly assigned to a certain CV fold . Subsequently , folds were checked to verify if : a ) the relative occurrence of the C classes in each fold did not deviate notably from the overall priors ( Table 6 . 1 ) ; and b ) if the total number of data samples were similar for all folds . In the event that any of these two conditions was violated , the randomization was repeated until both conditions were satisﬁed . On the other hand , for the study of performance results in the task of classifying PA modality , 5 - fold SBSCV procedures – instead of 10 - fold – were carried out due to the more restrained number of sequences available about modality , which totalled 25 ( Table 6 . 1 ) . 6 . 3 . 5 . 2 Parameter tuning All of the automated learning schemes under study here – except for logistic regression – re - quired the choice of certain key conﬁguration parameters , often known as hyperparameters in the context of ML . Hyperparameters deﬁne important aspects of the learning procedure , for instance : the topology of the MLP network . Hence , an essential part of this work con - sisted in determining the most suitable values for those hyperparameters given the dataset under study , with the aim at optimizing the performance of the classiﬁers as measured via the custom score metric presented in ( 6 . 20 ) . For this tuning procedure , the space of possible parameter values was explored using grid search , with nested 10 × 10 - fold SBSCV carried out on data regarding PA intensity in order to assess performance . For all of the clustering algorithms , a suitable number of clusters needed to be established . Other relevant hyperparameters – e . g . the linkage criterion in hierarchical clustering , or the size and topology of the SOM network – were tested and chosen in a preliminary stage . This was done for simplicity reasons , i . e . to keep the parameter tuning procedure tractable in practise . For the multinomial logistic regression , parameters were not required ; whereas for the MLP , a suitable number of neurons in the hidden layer had to be selected . For the two 89 6 . 4 . Results meta - classiﬁers ( Bagging and Boosting ) , assuming that the hyperparameters for the ‘weak learners’ ( CART trees ) were fully speciﬁed by MATLAB’s defaults , the parameter tuning procedure consisted here in selecting an optimal number of ensembles , i . e . how many training iterations were performed . The most demanding case was for SVMs , where two hyperparameters needed to be set , namely : i ) kernel bandwidth – σ in equation ( 6 . 18 ) – , and ii ) the box constraint C box , which constitutes a penalty for misclassiﬁed samples during training , thus regulating an eventual overﬁtting [ Vapnik , 1998 ] ( appendix A . 3 . 4 ) . 6 . 4 Results 6 . 4 . 1 Dimensionality reduction Data items in the original 42 - dimensional feature space are depicted in the scatter plot matrix of Figure 6 . 8 . The PCA projection was capable of covering > 90 % of total variance ( exactly 91 . 43 % ) in a subspace built with only the 8 eigenvectors with highest associated eigenvalues ( Figure 6 . 9 ) ; whereas the LDA projection ( Figure 6 . 10 ) generated two discrim - inants ( i . e . C − 1 , with C = 3 PA classes under consideration here ) . In the two cases of mRMR ﬁlter - based feature selection and for comparability reasons with respect to PCA , the number of selected features was set ﬁxed at 8 . Among those eight , a total of 5 features were selected by both the continuous ( Figure 6 . 11 ) and discrete ( Figure 6 . 12 ) mRMR versions , namely : • mean HR : hr • maximum HR : max hr • maximum step count : max st • mean HR multiplied by mean ‘pseudo - norm’ acceleration counts ( log - transformed ) : hr · sign log ( ¯ a pn ) • percentage of activity counts in the main axis ( a 1 ) falling between ActiGraph’s default lower and upper cutpoints , as published by Freedson et al . [ 1998 ] ( but rescaled by 1 / 6 to match 10 s epochs ) . Iterative procedures for wrapper - based feature selections , either with greedy best - ﬁrst or genetic search strategies , were terminated whenever increases in the custom performance score from ( 6 . 20 ) – assessed via SBSCV procedures – did no longer occur or were negligible . Speciﬁc feature selections were carried with each classiﬁcation algorithm from section 6 . 3 . 3 . 2 being wrapped . However , for brevity reasons Figures 6 . 13 and 6 . 14 depict only the outcomes for those feature selection procedures in which the overall ‘wrapped’ performance score was computed as the average of scores attained by each classiﬁer . In this case , the greedy sequential search yielded an optimal subset composed of 9 features ; whereas the solution found by genetic search contained notably more features , up to 27 . The intersection between both sets consisted of six common features . These were : • mean activity counts in the main axis : ¯ a 1 • mean step counts : st • mean HR : hr ( in common with both mRMR ﬁlter - based solutions ) • mean HR multiplied by mean ‘pseudo - norm’ acceleration counts , log - transformed : hr · sign log ( ¯ a pn ) ( also in common with both mRMR ﬁlters ) • maximum - to - minimum range for counts in the main axis ( log - transformed ) : sign log ( max a 1 ) • signal variability ( log - transformed ) for the ‘pseudo - norm’ activity counts : sign log ( sv a pn ) . 90 6 . PA intensity and modality classiﬁcation using accelerometry and HR Figure 6 . 8 : Scatter plot matrix of the original 42 - dimensional feature space . Each row and each column in the matrix represent a feature , in such a manner that subpanels depict the 2D projection of the dataset onto the two corresponding dimensions , hence allowing to show mutual correlations . Subgraphs in the main diagonal depict 1D histograms for each feature . Blue , green and red points correspond respectively to low , moderate and vigorous PA intensities . A total of 5359 data instances ( 178 . 63 h ) are plotted . Of note , the cardinalities of subsets obtained by greedy procedures were consistently and markedly lower than for their genetic equivalents : ranging from 5 features in the Boosting - speciﬁc greedy solution to 10 in the Bagging - speciﬁc greedy wrapper ; compared with 18 features for the Boosting - speciﬁc genetic wrapper and with 29 in the SVM - speciﬁc genetic solution . This behaviour may indicate that – at least for these classiﬁers and on the current dataset – problems in performance associated with the so - called ‘curse of dimensionality’ did not appear to be relevant until a relatively high number of dimensions . 6 . 4 . 2 Parameter tuning Table 6 . 2 contains the ﬁnal choices of hyperparameter values for each combination of di - mensionality reduction method and ML algorithm under consideration . Wrapper - based feature selection cases were not covered for any of the clustering approaches , since these wrapper procedures rely by deﬁnition on a classiﬁcations which clusterers cannot provide on their own . Of note , considerable variability can be observed in terms of choices for values , an aspect which points out the importance of this parameter tuning stage . 91 6 . 4 .

Results 6 . 4 . 3 Model selection Tables 6 . 3 – 6 . 5 and Figures 6 . 15 – 6 . 18 summarize outcomes in terms of performance metrics ( accuracy , f - measures and custom scores ) for the task of PA intensity classiﬁcation , as obtained during 10 - fold SBSCV procedures for model selection . Among the schemes based on clustering techniques for pattern identiﬁcation , the highest performance was achieved by the LDA + SOM combination , with a score of 84 . 67 ± 0 . 57 % and accuracy 89 . 09 ± 0 . 42 % ( mean ± SD ) ; followed by LDA + K - means and LDA + Hierarchical clustering , both with slightly lower – although virtually identical – average scores ( Table 6 . 3 ) . For a deﬁnitive selection , these three models were trained and evaluated in the recog - nition of PA modality during vigorous exercise , yielding respective scores of 77 . 94 ± 5 . 93 % , 82 . 61 ± 7 . 16 % and 80 . 08 ± 4 . 90 % . Therefore , the LDA + K - means scheme was ultimately selected . Table 6 . 6 details its SBSCV performance in both PA intensity and modality classiﬁcation . On the other hand , among the schemes built on supervised classiﬁers , the best results were attained by the Bagging algorithm when applied on the feature space selected by the Bagging - speciﬁc wrapper with genetic search methods . In particular , this model achieved a total SBSCV performance score of 85 . 17 ± 0 . 49 % , with accuracy 89 . 66 ± 0 . 35 % ( mean ± SD ) in the task of PA intensity recognition , as well as score 97 . 90 ± 1 . 12 % in the identiﬁcation of PA modality during vigorous exercise periods ( Table 6 . 7 ) . 6 . 4 . 4 Performance in classiﬁcation For a deﬁnitive assessment of the classiﬁcation performance attained by the selected schemes , a leave - one - subject - out cross - validation ( LOSOCV ) was carried out . In this procedure , se - quences of data belonging to all individuals except one were used in successive turns to train the algorithms , whereas data from the unseen subject served for testing purposes . For the task of classifying PA intensity levels , LDA + K - means obtained a total performance score of 84 . 65 % , with accuracy 88 . 86 % and respective f - measures of 95 . 59 % , 72 . 28 % and 81 . 86 % for low , moderate an vigorous intensity ranges ( Table 6 . 8 ) . Of note , when subject # A5 – who contributed with 45 . 83 % of the total volume of data – was left aside from the training and used instead for testing , an outstanding recognition was reached , with a score as high as 96 . 69 % . However , a similar LOSOCV procedure was not feasible for PA modal - ity identiﬁcation , since only this individual # A5 collected data for the sustained aerobic modality . On the other hand , the ML model formed by the combination of wrapper - based feature selection ( genetic search , Bagging - speciﬁc wrapper ) plus a Bagging classiﬁer gener - alized with slightly lower performances than LDA + K - means , in particular : 83 . 06 % score and 88 . 62 % accuracy ( Table 6 . 9 ) ; whereas its behaviour for subject # A5 was again above the average , with a score of 90 . 40 % . Figures 6 . 19 – 6 . 20 depict various example sequences concerning the classiﬁcation of PA in - tensity , respectively generated by the LDA + K - means and Wrapper ( genetic , speciﬁc ) + Bagging algorithms when trained by means of LOSOCV procedures .

Results These latter ﬂuctuations had their origin in the speciﬁc exercise scheduling for Exp . B ( PRONAF study protocol ) , where three vigorous bouts with duration 7 3 / 4 min were alter - nated with 5 min ‘active recovery’ periods . Long - term discrepancies rarely occurred since errors tended to be brief in duration . 6 . 4 . 4 . 1 Impact of temporal ﬁltering In those scenarios embracing clustering techniques ( section 6 . 3 . 3 . 1 ) for the identiﬁcation of relevant signal patterns , the subsequent HMM stage served not only to transform cluster assignments – as a ‘smart quantization’ of data vectors [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] – into PA classes ; but also to incorporate temporal trends beyond the scale of a single 2 - min analysis window . Conversely , such a HMM ﬁltering procedure would no longer be strictly necessary in the case of supervised classiﬁers , since their outcome predictions correspond directly to the targeted PA classes . Nevertheless , the application of HMMs can still be beneﬁcial to exploit temporal redundancy across consecutive samples . In order to verify this aspect , the Bagging algorithm was evaluated under the same procedures as in precedent sections , although without the use of HMM . In the SBSCV situation and with respect to Table 6 . 7 , performances for the task of iden - tifying PA intensity decreased by ∼ 1 % if HMMs were not employed ; yielding a score of 84 . 14 ± 0 . 38 % ( mean ± SD ) , accuracy 88 . 50 ± 0 . 23 % and respective f - measures for low , mod - erate and vigorous PA : 94 . 44 ± 0 . 08 % , 71 . 83 ± 0 . 55 % and 81 . 77 ± 0 . 82 % ( n = 30 ) . A similar behaviour was also observed for PA modality classiﬁcation , with even more pronounced decays ( ∼ 6 % ) , to a score of 91 . 99 ± 0 . 55 % , accuracy 92 . 28 ± 0 . 48 % and f - measures for sus - tained aerobic , mixed and anaerobic exercises , respectively : 92 . 08 ± 0 . 58 % , 89 . 87 ± 1 . 19 % and 93 . 73 ± 0 . 37 % . In addition , the LOSOCV evaluation for PA intensity showed perfor - mance metrics which were also lower without HMMs , descending by ∼ 2 – 3 % from a score 83 . 06 % and accuracy 88 . 62 % ( Table 6 . 9 ) to respectively 80 . 74 % and 86 . 62 % . Besides , the positive eﬀect in terms of classiﬁcation performance and robustness , attributable to the incorporation of the HMM - based temporal ﬁltering module , can be observed in a very illustrative , graphical manner . Figure 6 . 21 depicts recognition results obtained for the same ground truth sequences as in Figures 6 . 19 – 6 . 20 , in this occasion when not using HMMs . Without HMM - based temporal ﬁltering , automatic PA class assignments ﬂuc - tuated remarkably more than in the ground truth data . This included cases in which recognition outcomes varied repeatedly from low to vigorous PA intensity and vice versa within a few windows , a behaviour which is expectable to be extremely rare for ground truth in practice , and which HMMs were successful in cancelling . 6 . 4 . 4 . 2 Comparison with other methodologies 6 . 4 . 4 . 2 . 1 Standard approaches in the application domain The de facto standard technique to identify PA intensity levels with accelerometers con - ceived for PA monitoring is by means of ‘cutpoints’ , i . e . by thresholds applied on the activ - ity counts recorded in the main accelerometry axis a 1 [ Freedson et al . , 1998 ; Sasaki et al . , 2011 ] . Indeed , this simple approach is the procedure implemented by ActiGraph’s com - mercial analysis software [ ActiGraph LLC , 2010 ] , which is extensively used and validated by sports scientists and epidemiologist who study the degree of physical activeness across populations . For the sake of establishing fair comparisons , such cutpoint - based method was applied on the dataset under study here , where activity counts recorded for a 1 were accumulated over 1 min epochs to match the methodology used in the original proposal 104 6 .

PA intensity and modality classiﬁcation using accelerometry and HR in literature [ Freedson et al . , 1998 ] . This procedure yielded a modest performance score of 63 . 60 % , with accuracy 77 . 45 % and f - measures 87 . 19 % , 61 . 01 % and 28 . 56 % respectively for low , moderate and vigorous PA intensity categories . In addition , this work also examined a MET estimation formula for ActiGraph accelerom - eters [ Crouter et al . , 2006 ] , which is based on non - linear regressions for counts and widely accepted . MET estimation outcomes were subsequently grouped into their corresponding PA intensity level ( < 3 , 3 – 6 or > 6 METs ) . Results in this case were slightly inferior than for the former approach : score 63 . 15 % , accuracy 77 . 56 % and f - measures 87 . 46 % , 62 . 20 % and 25 . 39 % . Notably , both methods presented an important fraction of their errors corresponding to vigorous resistance exercise from Exp . B , which being static with respect to waist move - ments – i . e . the location where the accelerometry sensor was placed – , became classiﬁed as of low intensity as a consequence of accounting solely for activity counts . 6 . 4 . 4 . 2 . 2 ML baseline comparison In is important to remark that none of the two standard techniques inspected above ( section 6 . 4 . 4 . 2 . 1 ) were designed to incorporate HR - related information , an issue which may – at least partially – explain their poor overall classiﬁcation performance ; in particular , their failure to recognize resistance activity appropriately . In order to compare results from the core proposal of this PhD thesis work with respect to methods capable of addressing the merge of accelerometry and HR sources , two basic ML algorithms were implemented here as baseline comparison , speciﬁcally CART decision trees and naïve Bayes classiﬁers . These two schemes were applied on a two - dimensional feature space combining : on the one side a ) the total activity counts in the main axis a 1 , accumulated over the 2 min window periods , and on the other hand b ) the average HR . These two magnitudes should be – at least intuitively [ Brage et al . , 2005 ] – the most informative signal descriptors , covering both mechanical and physiological phenomena in relation to PA . CART decision trees performed slightly better with activity counts a 1 expressed in natural units ( score 72 . 27 % , accuracy 80 . 31 % and f - measures 92 . 01 % , 52 . 94 % and 63 . 82 % in LOSOCV ) ; whereas the naïve Bayes classiﬁer worked best when operating on log - transformed a 1 counts ( score 76 . 79 % , accuracy 82 . 941 % and f - measures 93 . 08 % , 60 . 63 % and 70 . 49 % in LOSOCV ) . Therefore , these two ML - based methods incorporating HR managed to improve notably the performance outcome metrics with respect to the standard approaches in the domain ( section 6 . 4 . 4 . 2 . 1 ) , in overall and also concerning vigorous resistance patterns from Exp . B . Nonetheless , their scores are yet markedly inferior than those by the main proposal presented here . 6 . 5 Discussion This work proposed , compared and evaluated a series of ML algorithms for the activity - independent PA classiﬁcation based on biaxial accelerometry and HR measurements , merged together in order to combine motion and physiological aspects of PA , and to overcome the limitations of each individual technique by separate . PA intensity levels , as well as exercise modality for vigorous periods , were recognized . In literature , the majority of ML - based PA classiﬁcation strategies follow an activity - speciﬁc recognition approach , having proved themselves capable of discerning – with notable 107 6 . 5 . Discussion accuracies – among a closed set of activity options performed in controlled laboratory envi - ronments . However , the range of activities embraced by these activity - speciﬁc approaches ( generally : lie , sit , stand , walk , run and / or bicycle ) may in practise be excessively limited as to apply these methods in the monitoring of free - living ambulatory scenarios , where a considerably more varied collection of both PA and non - PA patterns occur . In this regard , the dataset under consideration in this work encompassed an appreciable variety of situ - ations , including daily life activities and the use of means of transportation ( allowing the algorithms to learn eventual artefact patterns caused by them ) , as well as assorted PAs , e . g . : dancing , karate , soccer or resistance / weight training , which correspond to real - life scenarios rarely covered by other works conduced in laboratory environments . To address such heterogeneity , an activity - independent PA classiﬁcation approach was adopted to discern between standard intensity levels ( < 3 , 3 – 6 , > 6 METs ) . Furthermore , this work constituted the ﬁrst known attempt to identify PA modality , an aspect which can be of interest in practical applications , e . g . in artiﬁcial pancreas systems for the manage - ment of T1D , where distinct acute glycaemic responses occur depending on the predominant metabolic pathway involved in the fuelling of exercise . The aggregation of accelerometry – reﬂecting displacements – and HR – as a physiologically sound marker in close relation to PA - induced loads on the cardiovascular system – consti - tutes a promising strategy for which sports scientists advocate [ Freedson and Miller , 2000 ; Ainslie et al . , 2003 ; Valanou et al . , 2006 ; Westerterp , 2009 ] . However , this approach has not yet gained extensive beneﬁt from the application of ML algorithms , since research eﬀorts have been mainly focused on mining exclusively accelerometry data , specially for activity - speciﬁc recognition . In this regard , it is surprising and counter - intuitive that Munguia Tapia et al . [ 2007 ] discarded HR - based features for not improving suﬃciently their activity - speciﬁc PA recognition ; whereas , on the contrary , notorious success in PA intensity classiﬁcation was reported by Lin et al . [ 2012 ] when merging accelerometry and ECG data . Authors employed a sensor network formed by three triaxial accelerometers ( placed on wrist , waist and ankle ) plus an ECG recorder to obtain outstanding classiﬁcation rates . However , their approach suﬀers from certain limitations , mainly : a ) the constraint heterogeneity of their data – which were collected in a controlled laboratory environment with few diﬀerent activities – , b ) the complexity of the sensor network , and c ) eventual validity issues of the devices during ﬁeld use . In this regard , this work opted for widely validated commercial devices as ActiGraph , which are among the de facto standard equipment in the ambulatory monitoring of PA by sports scientists and epidemiologists . Nevertheless , their output in the form of counts , along with the 10 - s epoch limitation imposed by ActiGraph’s ﬁrmware when registering HR data , prevented from carrying out any spectral or wavelet analysis on the accelerometry signals , which could have provided information - rich features [ Bao and Intille , 2004 ] . A total of 178 . 63 h ( 5359 windows , each with duration 2 min ) of multi - modal data were collected here in 92 sequences / sessions from a diverse population formed by 16 subjects ( 9 males and 7 females , age range 20 – 49 ) , healthy and overweight individuals with diﬀerent lifestyles . Despite the limited number of participants , results concerning performance in the PA intensity classiﬁcation task as obtained in the LOSOCV procedures were compa - rable ( scores : 83 . 06 % for Wrapper + Bagging , 84 . 65 % for LDA + K - means ) to those from the SBSCV used during model selection ( mean scores : 85 . 17 % and 84 . 57 % , respectively ) , although slightly inferior for the case of Bagging . In addition , the LOSOCV partial re - sults obtained when leaving subject # A5 ( 81 . 87 h of data ) out of the training set were 108 6 . PA intensity and modality classiﬁcation using accelerometry and HR highly satisfactory , with a performance score of 90 . 40 % for Wrapper + Bagging and 96 . 69 % for LDA + K - means . These two aspects indicate good generalization capabilities by both algorithms , with a perceptible advantage for the LDA + K - means scheme in terms of gen - eralizability . Hence , overﬁtting to the available data is unlikely to have occurred . On the other hand , there was a marked superiority of Wrapper + Bagging in the task of PA modal - ity classiﬁcation : mean score 97 . 90 % versus 82 . 61 % in LDA + K - means . Classiﬁers employed HR measurements without the need for subject - speciﬁc resting basal HR compensations , an aspect which may constitute a major advantage for the monitoring of large populations , removing the burden of individualized calibration procedures [ Valanou et al . , 2006 ] . In order to establish fair evaluations of the performance obtained on this work’s particular dataset by diﬀerent types of solutions – and inspired by the approach followed by [ Freedson et al . , 2011 ] to validate their proposal – , results were compared against two methods which can be considered current standards in this application domain : Freedson et al . [ 1998 ] ; Crouter et al . [ 2006 ] . Both schemes suﬀered serious performance problems , particularly to identify vigorous resistance exercise periods from Exp . B . This behaviour should not be however surprising , since this type of PA did not involve pronounced waist movements and operated only with ActiGraph’s accelerometry data , not incorporating HR as a relevant source of physiological information . In this regard , two additional ML - based classiﬁers – speciﬁcally CART trees and naïve Bayes ( NB ) – were implemented as baseline comparisons . These CART and NB schemes learnt from data comprising : a ) the total activity counts in the main axis a 1 , and b ) the mean HR along the window ; considered as the two most informative features , at least intuitively [ Brage et al . , 2005 ] . With scores 72 . 27 % and 76 . 79 % in LOSOCV , these two methods outperformed the aforementioned approaches without ML [ Freedson et al . , 1998 ; Crouter et al . , 2006 ] , although they were yet considerably less accurate than this PhD works’ proposals . Freedson et al . [ 2011 ] ; Trost et al . [ 2012 ] , in the context of developing MLP - based MET estimators for respectively adult and paediatric populations , also addressed the problem of PA intensity classiﬁcation . Results reported by Freedson et al . [ 2011 ] ( score 75 . 78 % , accu - racy 76 . 99 % and f - measures 84 . 36 % , 75 . 08 % and 66 . 67 % ) show a perceptible , yet moderate improvement with respect to the non - ML standard methodologies [ Freedson et al . , 1998 ; Crouter et al . , 2006 ] , which yielded scores 70 . 03 % , 71 . 52 % . Nevertheless , this improve - ment due to their MLP neural networks is more modest than in this work’s case . On the other hand , the diﬀerent criterion adopted by [ Trost et al . , 2012 ] when deﬁning their four intensity intervals , along with their methodology to report results ( which was focused on recall / sensitivity criteria only ) , prevented establishing direct comparisons in terms of per - formance . Finally , given that most of classiﬁcation errors tended to appear around transients in ground truth , instead of as long - term mismatches ( Figures 6 . 19 - 6 . 20 ) , the overall impact and po - tential loss of quality in the recognition – as caused by those transient errors – should be in practice limited for realistic ambulatory applications . In this regard , the HMM was ca - pable of exploiting successfully temporal redundancy in data , when long - term trends were maintained stable . However , it had moderate diﬃculties to match quick ﬂuctuations in the ground truth from the short - interval training protocol from Exp . B . Anyhow , it is expected that such quick oscillations would be infrequent in practical free - living scenarios and lifestyle monitoring . 109 6 . 5 . Discussion 110 Part IV Metabolic modelling in T1D 111 Chapter 7 State of the art Mechanistic metabolic models for T1D – i . e . mathematical descriptions of the physiological ﬂuxes which lead to glucose - insulin homoeostasis – are essential for the development and evaluation of new therapies , in particular for the progress and consolidation of artiﬁcial pancreas systems . As one of their key applications , metabolic models allow for simulating and validating in silico decision support strategies and closed - loop controllers in a safer , quicker and more aﬀordable manner than animal or human experiments . This includes the virtual simulation of certain situations which would otherwise pose major health risks to patients . Nonetheless , clinical trials on humans will remain to be the unique means of evaluating the suitability of therapeutic proposals under real circumstances [ Cobelli et al . , 2009 ] . 7 . 1 Metabolic models for T1D Since the ﬁrst models for glucose - insulin homoeostasis were proposed in the late 1970s – mainly by Guyton et al . [ 1978 ] ; Bergman et al . [ 1979 ] – , a considerable number of other models have been added . Whereas a profound review of those can be found elsewhere [ Co - belli et al . , 2009 ] ; this section overviews two models which are arguably the most renowned in literature . 7 . 1 . 1 Padova model Approved in 2008 by USA’s Foods and Drugs Administration ( FDA ) as a substitute to animal tests [ Kovatchev et al . , 2009 ] , the Padova model [ Dalla Man et al . , 2006 , 2007 ] was developed using a dataset with glucose proﬁles from 204 healthy individuals without diabetes , who underwent a meal experiment [ Dalla Man et al . , 2006 ] with a triple - tracer protocol in order to obtain temporal curves about relevant glucose and insulin ﬂuxes in a virtually model - independent manner [ Basu et al . , 2003 ] . The version of the model presented here includes certain particularizations to adapt it for T1D [ Magni et al . , 2008 ] , e . g . with a lack of endogenous insulin production . Superindices b are onwards used to denote steady - state basal regimes applied to the initial conditions for the mass - balance diﬀerential equations which are constitutive of the model . 113 7 . 1 .

State of the art 7 . 1 . 1 . 1 Glucose subsystem This part of the model comprises two glucose mass compartments , where : i ) the accessible one represents plasma and tissues which equilibrate rapidly with respect to plasma glucose concentrations , and where ii ) the non - accessible compartment encompasses other tissues which equilibrate in a slower manner . Mass - balance diﬀerential equations regulating ﬂuxes are stated by the authors as follows : d d tG P ( t ) = − k 1 G P ( t ) + k 2 G T ( t ) + EGP ( t ) − U II ( t ) − E ( t ) + R A ( t ) ( 7 . 1 ) d d tG T ( t ) = k 1 G P ( t ) − k 2 G T ( t ) − U ID ( t ) ( 7 . 2 ) G P ( t = 0 ) = G bP ( 7 . 3 ) G T ( t = 0 ) = G bT ( 7 . 4 ) where ( 7 . 3 ) – ( 7 . 4 ) cover the basal steady - state conditions . Besides , plasma glucose concentration – as it would be measured if intravenous blood sam - ples were to be taken – is associated to G P mass in plasma by the following relationship : G IV ( t ) = G P ( t ) V G ( 7 . 5 ) 7 . 1 . 1 . 1 . 1 Renal excretion Authors model renal excretion with a thresholded activation behaviour , in which a ) excre - tion only occurs when glucose mass surpasses a certain level k E 2 , and b ) its rate of excretion is in proportion with the excess of mass over such k E 2 threshold : E ( t ) = ( k E 1 [ G P ( t ) − k E 2 ] if G P ( t ) > k E 2 0 if G P ( t ) ≤ k E 2 ( 7 . 6 ) 7 . 1 . 1 . 1 . 2 Endogenous glucose production Body’s endogenous glucose production ( EGP ) is assumed to be modulated by : a ) current plasma glucose G P , and b ) a delayed insulin signal I D 2 detailed later on in section 7 . 1 . 1 . 2 . 3 : EGP ( t ) = max { 0 , k P 1 − k P 2 G P ( t ) − k P 3 I D 2 ( t ) } ( 7 . 7 ) EGP ( t = 0 ) = EGP b ( 7 . 8 ) where ( 7 . 7 ) includes a particularization for T1D situations [ Magni et al . , 2008 ] with respect to the general model ﬁrst published by Dalla Man et al . [ 2007 ] , which consists in dismissing endogenous insulin in the portal vein ( i . e . I Po = 0 ) , since in T1D there does not exist any endogenous insulin production altogether . 7 . 1 . 1 . 1 . 3 Glucose utilization Insulin - independent The Padova model characterizes the insulin - independent glucose utilization U II as a con - stant uptake in response to sustained glucose demands from the brain and central nervous system . Therefore : U II ( t ) = F CNS ( 7 . 9 ) 115 7 . 1 . Metabolic models for T1D Insulin - dependent The portion of absorbed glucose U ID which is dependent on insulin concentrations is as - sumed by authors to follow a non - linear Michaelis - Menten relationship : U ID ( t ) = G T ( t ) K M 0 + G T ( t ) V M ( t ) ( 7 . 10 ) where its K parameter is constant and equal to K M 0 , and where its V term introduces in turn the eﬀect of insulin X in the process : V M ( t ) = V M 0 + V MX X ( t ) ( 7 . 11 ) 7 . 1 . 1 . 2 Insulin subsystem Two insulin compartments with masses I L , I P are deﬁned , the ﬁrst of which corresponds to the liver and the second one to plasma : d d tI L ( t ) = − ( m 1 + m 3 ) I L ( t ) + m 2 I P ( t ) ( 7 . 12 ) d d tI P ( t ) = m 1 I L ( t ) + ( m 2 + m 4 ) I P ( t ) + k A 1 S 1 ( t ) + k A 2 S 2 ( t ) ( 7 . 13 ) I L ( t = 0 ) = I bL ( 7 . 14 ) I P ( t = 0 ) = I bP ( 7 . 15 ) In practise , blood samples would be taken from plasma in order to measure insulin con - centrations I , which would be proportional to the total insulin mass I P and distributed in the corresponding volume for insulin V I : I ( t ) = I P ( t ) V I ( 7 . 16 ) In formulae ( 7 . 12 ) – ( 7 . 13 ) , several T1D - speciﬁc modiﬁcations apply with respect to the original model for healthy subjects [ Dalla Man et al . , 2007 ] . These particularizations are [ Magni et al . , 2008 ] : i ) m 3 is assumed to be constant , ii ) there does not exist any S term addressing pancreatic insulin secretion in equation ( 7 . 12 ) for I L ; but instead iii ) masses S 1 , S 2 are introduced in equation ( 7 . 13 ) to represent exogenous insulin absorptions towards the plasma insulin compartment I P . 7 . 1 . 1 . 2 . 1 Subcutaneous insulin absorption Exogenous insulin infused through the subcutaneous route at a known rate IIR passes two diﬀusion compartments , modelled by masses S 1 , S 2 . S 1 accounts for the amount of non - monomeric insulin , which is either transformed into the monomeric form at a rate k D , or enters circulation at a diﬀerent rate k A 1 ; whereas in turn the mass of monomeric insulin S 2 becomes absorbed at a rate k A 2 : d d t S 1 ( t ) = − ( k A 1 + k D ) S 1 ( t ) + IIR ( t ) ( 7 . 17 ) d d tS 2 ( t ) = k D S 1 ( t ) − k A 2 S 2 ( t ) ( 7 . 18 ) S 1 ( t = 0 ) = S b 1 ( 7 . 19 ) S 2 ( t = 0 ) = S b 2 ( 7 . 20 ) 116 7 . State of the art 7 . 1 . 1 . 2 . 2 Remote eﬀect Magnitude X covers the inﬂuence of the insulin signal on glucose absorption ( section 7 . 1 . 1 . 1 . 3 ) .

At the view of ( 7 . 15 ) and ( 7 . 16 ) , I b must equal : I b = I bP V I ( 7 . 23 ) 7 . 1 . 1 . 2 . 3 Delayed insulin signal For the delayed insulin signal aﬀecting EGP , authors consider two compartments with identical transfer rate k I and the same initial conditions as in ( 7 . 23 ) : d d tI D 1 ( t ) = − k I I D 1 ( t ) + k I I ( t ) ( 7 . 24 ) d d tI D 2 ( t ) = k I I D 1 ( t ) − k I I D 2 ( t ) ( 7 . 25 ) I D 1 ( t = 0 ) = I b ( 7 . 26 ) I D 2 ( t = 0 ) = I b ( 7 . 27 ) 7 . 1 . 1 . 3 Absorption of meal glucose According to authors’ proposal , three compartments are involved in the absorption of meal glucose by the intestine : two of which correspond to glucose masses temporarily stored in the stomach ( either in solid Q Sto 1 or liquid phase Q Sto 2 ) , plus a third compartment Q Gut for the gut : d d tQ Sto 1 ( t ) = − k Gri Q Sto 1 ( t ) + D ( t ) ( 7 . 28 ) d d tQ Sto 2 ( t ) = k Gri Q Sto 1 ( t ) − k Gut ( t , Q Sto ) Q Sto 2 ( t ) ( 7 . 29 ) d d t Q Gut ( t ) = k Gut ( t , Q Sto ) Q Sto 2 ( t ) − k Abs Q Gut ( t ) ( 7 . 30 ) Q Sto 1 ( t = 0 ) = 0 ( 7 . 31 ) Q Sto 2 ( t = 0 ) = 0 ( 7 . 32 ) Q Gut ( t = 0 ) = 0 ( 7 . 33 ) where the total amount of glucose in the stomach must therefore sum : Q Sto ( t ) = Q Sto 1 ( t ) + Q Sto 2 ( t ) ( 7 . 34 ) Magnitude D in ( 7 . 28 ) is the rate at which the subject ingests glucose [ mg / min ] , and R A in ( 7 . 1 ) is the rate of appearance of meal - attributable glucose in the blood stream , derived from Q Gut according to the following expression : R A ( t ) = fk Abs Q Gut ( t ) BW ( 7 . 35 ) 117 7 . 1 .

Moreover , it is also the supporting patient model for a MPC artiﬁcial pancreas control algorithm which has consistently shown very meritorious and promising results in a series of clinical trials in diverse scenarios : from the critical care unit [ Leelarathna et al . , 2013 ] to free - living outpatient environments [ Elleri et al . , 2014 ; Leelarathna et al . , 2014 ; Thabit et al . , 2014 ; Hovorka et al . , 2014 ] , as well as applied on adolescent subjects [ Elleri et al . , 2013b ] , T2D patients [ Kumareswaran et al . , 2013b ] and pregnant women with T1D [ Murphy et al . , 2011 ] .

Metabolic models for T1D as of its counterpart for insulin action ( section 7 . 1 . 2 . 2 ) – was demonstrated for healthy sub - jects during an intravenous glucose tolerance test ( IVGTT ) [ Hovorka et al . , 2002 ; Wilinska et al . , 2010 ] . Fluxes are described by the following mass - balance diﬀerential equations : d d tQ 1 ( t ) = − k 21 ( t ) Q 1 ( t ) + k 12 Q 2 ( t ) + EGP ( t ) − F 01 ( t ) − F R ( t ) + U G ( t ) ( 7 . 42 ) d d tQ 2 ( t ) = k 21 ( t ) Q 1 ( t ) − [ k 12 + k 02 ( t ) ] Q 2 ( t ) ( 7 . 43 ) Q 1 ( t = 0 ) = Q 01 ( 7 . 44 ) Q 2 ( t = 0 ) = Q 02 ( 7 . 45 ) Glucose mass Q 1 in the accessible compartment is distributed in the corresponding volume for glucose V G . Therefore , the relationship between Q 1 and the intravenous – i . e . plasma – glucose concentration G IV is as follows : G IV ( t ) = Q 1 ( t ) V G ( 7 . 46 ) 7 . 1 . 2 . 1 . 1 Glucose renal excretion The elimination of glucose excesses by the kidneys is assumed to commence above a certain threshold value R Thr , with a clearance rate which grows linearly with glycaemia levels higher than R Thr : F R ( t ) = ( R Cl [ G IV ( t ) − R Thr ] V G if G IV ( t ) ≥ R Thr 0 otherwise ( 7 . 47 ) Of note , this particular aspect of the glucose - insulin dynamics is equivalent in both the Cambridge and Padova model proposals . 7 . 1 . 2 . 1 . 2 Endogenous Glucose Production Authors capture the remote eﬀect of insulin on EGP by means of an auxiliary magnitude X 3 which acts by lowering glucose production as a consequence of higher insulin levels : EGP ( t ) = ( EGP 0 [ 1 − X 3 ( t ) ] if X 3 ( t ) < 1 0 otherwise ( 7 . 48 ) where EGP 0 represents a reference endogenous production rate extrapolated to a limit case in which insulin is not available at all , i . e . when X 3 = 0 . 7 . 1 . 2 . 1 . 3 Glucose utilization Insulin - independent The most recent version of the Cambridge model [ Wilinska et al . , 2010 ] characterizes the rate at which a portion of glucose gets disposed from plasma ( in a regime totally inde - pendent from insulin concentrations ) by means of a saturable process whose disposal ﬂux follows a Michaelis - Menten relationship : F 01 ( t ) = 1 F S 01 G IV ( t ) K M + G IV ( t ) F 01 ( 7 . 49 ) being F S 01 = 0 . 85 ( dimensionless ) a known correction factor [ Wilinska et al . , 2010 ] , and where K M = 1 . 0 mmol / L is a ﬁxed constant across individuals . 120 7 . State of the art Insulin - dependent In this case , the insulin - dependent glucose utilization is formed by two components . On the one side , it comprises a remote eﬀect of insulin X 1 which equals by deﬁnition the rate of glucose distribution / transport from the accessible to the non - accessible compartment . Thus : k 21 ( t ) = X 1 ( t ) ( 7 . 50 ) On the other hand , it also incorporates a remote eﬀect of insulin X 2 on the rates of disposal from the non - accessible glucose compartment : k 02 ( t ) = X 2 ( t ) ( 7 . 51 ) 7 . 1 . 2 . 2 Insulin subsystem 7 . 1 . 2 . 2 . 1 Subcutaneous insulin absorption and kinetics The block which describes the absorption of insulin is formed by three compartments [ Wilinska et al . , 2005 ] : two subcutaneous insulin depots – one accessible S SC 1 and one non - accessible S SC 2 , both characterized by identical transfer rates k A – plus a subsequent plasma compartment whose mass is represented by the variable S P as follows : d d tS SC 1 ( t ) = − k A S SC 1 ( t ) + U I ( t ) ( 7 . 52 ) d d tS SC 2 ( t ) = k A S SC 1 ( t ) − k A S SC 2 ( t ) ( 7 . 53 ) d d tS P ( t ) = k A S SC 2 ( t ) − k E S P ( t ) ( 7 . 54 ) S SC 1 ( t = 0 ) = S 0 SC 1 ( 7 . 55 ) S SC 2 ( t = 0 ) = S 0 SC 2 ( 7 . 56 ) S P ( t = 0 ) = S 0 P ( 7 . 57 ) where U I denotes the rate of exogenous insulin infusion . Accordingly , plasma insulin concentration – as it would be measured through blood samples – corresponds to the total insulin mass in plasma S P divided by the corresponding distribution volume for insulin V I . Hence : I ( t ) = S P ( t ) V I ( 7 . 58 ) 7 . 1 . 2 . 2 . 2 Remote eﬀect Originating from a study which involved multiple - tracer experiments in healthy subjects [ Hovorka et al . , 2002 ] , this module of the Cambridge model characterizes insulin action by encompassing three diﬀerent remote eﬀects of insulin on various aspects of glucose kinetics : i ) the inﬂuence of insulin on the transport and distribution of glucose , ii ) its eﬀect on disposal , and ﬁnally iii ) on EGP . This part of the Cambridge model originated from an study involving multiple - tracer experiments in healthy subjects . Relevant model parameters include , among others , three insulin sensitivities S IT , S ID , S IE which are respectively 121 7 . 1 . Metabolic models for T1D associated to X 1 ( transport / distribution ) , X 2 ( disposal ) and X 3 ( EGP suppression ) : d d tX 1 ( t ) = − k A 1 X 1 ( t ) + k A 1 S IT I ( t ) ( 7 . 59 ) d d tX 2 ( t ) = − k A 2 X 2 ( t ) + k A 2 S ID I ( t ) ( 7 . 60 ) d d tX 3 ( t ) = − k A 3 X 3 ( t ) + k A 3 S IE I ( t ) ( 7 . 61 ) X 1 ( t = 0 ) = 0 ( 7 . 62 ) X 2 ( t = 0 ) = 0 ( 7 . 63 ) X 3 ( t = 0 ) = 0 ( 7 . 64 ) 7 . 1 . 2 . 3 Absorption of meal glucose Authors represent the physiological processes for the absorption of meal - attributable glu - cose which occurs in the gut by means of a two - compartmental model , in which both compartments in the chain share identical fractional transfer rates . Of note , this part of Cambridge model was shown to be adequate in the capture and representation of glucose’s rate of appearance in plasma from the gastrointestinal tract [ Hovorka et al . , 2007 ; Wilinska et al . , 2010 ] . In particular , it comprises two key parameters : i ) CHO bioavailability Bio , and ii ) time t Max for the appearance of a peak ( i . e . maximum ) in terms of glucose levels : d d tG 1 ( t ) = − 1 t Max G 1 ( t ) + Bio · D ( t ) ( 7 . 65 ) d d tG 2 ( t ) = 1 t Max G 1 ( t ) − 1 t Max G 2 ( t ) ( 7 . 66 ) G 1 ( t = 0 ) = 0 ( 7 . 67 ) G 2 ( t = 0 ) = 0 ( 7 . 68 ) being U D the rate of ingestion of CHO by the subject , expressed in [ µ mol / kg · min − 1 ] . In accordance , the resulting absorption rate by the gut U G to be used in ( 7 . 42 ) can be derived from glucose masses as follows : U G ( t ) = G 2 ( t ) t Max ( 7 . 69 ) 7 . 1 . 2 . 4 Subcutaneous measurements Interstitial glucose kinetics is represented by a diﬀusion process between plasma and inter - stitium compartments , characterized by a constant transfer rate k A , Int which deﬁnes the delay of subcutaneous glucose G SC with respect to the intravenous plasma kinetics G IV : d d tG SC ( t ) = − k A , Int G SC ( t ) + k A , Int G IV ( t ) ( 7 . 70 ) G SC ( t = 0 ) = G IV ( t = 0 ) = Q 01 V G ( 7 . 71 ) where initial conditions ( 7 . 71 ) are in accordance with ( 7 . 44 ) , ( 7 . 46 ) . 122 7 . State of the art 7 . 2 Overview and extensions The Padova model gained important renown after being approved by the FDA in 2008 for in silico simulations in replacement for animal tests . Nevertheless , the same authors have published a number of extensions ever since . Notably , Dalla Man et al . [ 2009 ] – proposed and compared three candidate modiﬁcations to incorporate the known physiological eﬀects of PA in the form of decays in glycaemia . The ﬁrst of those models assumed : a ) an exercise - induced rise in non - insulin - dependent glucose clearance , with quick activation and deactivation ; plus b ) a rapid increase in insulin sensitivity , followed by a slow return to normal levels [ Breton , 2008 ] . On the other hand , their second model did not account for rapid changes in glucose clearance , but instead augmented glucose utilization . Finally , their third model ( and authors’ ultimate choice attending to the results of simulated clamp experiments ) was similar to their ﬁrst proposal , although with an extra increase in insulin action in proportion to the accumulated exercise intensity and duration . Dalla Man et al . [ 2009 ] used the over - resting HR ( i . e . excesses with respect to resting basal HR ) as their indicator of exercise intensity , assuming a linear relationship between both magnitudes . Although non - linearities are known to occur – specially in light and heavy exercise intensities [ Freedson and Miller , 2000 ] – , this relatively simple assumption may be a reasonable starting point . However , one of the main limitation of this proposal resides in the lack of data – either from healthy or T1D subjects – as to justify and support model as - sumptions , or in order to ﬁt model parameters to experimental proﬁles . In addition , other known physiological events related to PA ( e . g . hyperglycaemia episodes induced by marked catecholamine secretions , these in turn caused by high - intensity exercise sessions ) cannot be covered by Dalla Man et al . [ 2009 ] ’s model , devised to reﬂect exclusively PA - induced decays in glycaemia . The Cambridge model has repeatedly proven its outstanding value as the core component of the Cambridge’s automated glucose controller . This MPC - based artiﬁcial pancreas system has been successfully applied in a number of clinical trials under various circumstances including outpatient , free - living environments . On the other hand and in comparison to other existing patient models – e . g . Padova’s ( which was derived on the basis of data obtained from healthy subjects , subsequently particularized to speciﬁc situations in T1D ) – , the Cambridge model stands out for its sound physiological ground , being tuned and conﬁrmed for real T1D patient data : with 15 patients [ Hovorka et al . , 2004 ] . For the context and purpose of this PhD thesis work , the Cambridge model served here as the starting point from which an extension is proposed , aiming to address the eﬀect of insulin on the disposal of meal - attributable glucose ( see coming chapter 8 ) . 123 7 . 2 . Overview and extensions 124 Chapter 8 Metabolic model for the remote eﬀect of insulin on the disposal of meal - attributable glucose in T1D 8 . 1 Motivation Meal intakes are the most prominent source of major excursions in glycaemia for T1D , ahead of unmatched insulin administrations or physical activity . On a daily basis and for every meal , patients need to decide by themselves suitable prandial insulin boluses , aim - ing : a ) to restrain glucose rises after meals , and at the same time b ) to minimize the risk of postprandial hyper - and / or hypoglycaemia episodes , respectively caused by insuﬃ - cient or excessive amounts of insulin . However , even experienced patients often estimate the amount and / or timing of boluses inappropriately [ Ahola et al . , 2010 ] . In turn , this issue carries important health implications from a clinical perspective , since those hyper - or hypoglycaemia events due to inappropriate boluses have a notable impact on overall glycaemic control as reﬂected by glycated haemoglobin HbA 1c [ Borg et al . , 2010 ] . Common strategies to manage postprandial glucose include CHO counting [ Laurenzi et al . , 2011 ] and bolus calculators [ Zisser et al . , 2008 ] . However , more detailed mechanistic de - scriptions of the prandial dynamics of glucose - insulin balance in T1D would be desirable . In this regard , the patient models outlined in previous chapter 7 do not address explicitly the role of exogenous insulin on the clearance of meal - attributable glucose ; a gap which may possibly stem from the lack of experimental data as to support the modelling and ver - iﬁcation of this aspect . Despite various publications in literature have studied postprandial absorption patterns for healthy , non - T1D individuals after ingesting glucose [ Dalla Man et al . , 2006 , 2007 ; Toﬀolo et al . , 2008 ] and standard meals [ Wachters - Hagedoorn et al . , 2006 , 2007 ; Priebe et al . , 2008 ] , it has not been however until recently [ Elleri et al . , 2013a ] that absorption patterns were reported for T1D patients after having consumed mixed meals with complex CHO . Elleri et al . [ 2013a ] compared two type of evening meals : one with high glycaemic - load ( HG ) , and another with low glycaemic - load ( LG ) . Authors reported absorption rates for meal - related glucose ( R A , meal ) reaching their maximum at higher values and later times for HG than for LG meals . Over the ﬁrst 30 min after ingestion , plasma glucose proﬁles for both HG and LG meals were similar , with comparable increases in gly - caemia being measured . Nonetheless , diﬀerences arose along the rest of the experiment : in the case of the HG meal , glucose peaked higher than for LG , and then decayed to reach basal levels within a period of 5 – 6 h ; whereas on the contrary , after the LG meal glucose 125 8 . 2 . Clinical experiment continued to rise progressively and did not return to basal levels within 8 h post - ingestion [ Elleri et al . , 2013a ] . In a complementary manner to Elleri et al . [ 2013a ] and based on data from the same clinical experiment – supplied by the Institute of Metabolic Science ( University of Cambridge , UK ) – , six mathematical models are proposed and evaluated here in terms of their ability to characterize the inﬂuence of plasma circulating insulin on observed postprandial glucose kinetics . More speciﬁcally , this chapter explores whether compartmental models comprising a remote eﬀect of plasma insulin on meal glucose disposal are supported by the experimental data . 8 . 2 Clinical experiment Sixteen young volunteers ( 7 females and 9 males , age range 16 – 24 ) , diagnosed with T1D for at least 6 months , were recruited for an experiment to reproduce glycaemia proﬁles observed after HG and LG evening meals by means of a variable - target glucose clamp . The study was approved by the local ethics committee and all participants provided written informed consent . Subjects were admitted to the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility ( Addenbrooke’s Hospital , Cambridge , UK ) on two diﬀerent occasions separated by one to ﬁve weeks . On a preliminary visit , from 6 : 00 p . m . and over 20 min ( Figure 8 . 1 ) participants consumed a mixed meal with complex CHO , either LG ( macaroni cheese : glycaemic load 54 , n = 8 ) or HG ( vegetable shepherd’s pie : glycaemic load 105 , n = 8 ) . Meals were matched for total CHO ( 121 g ) , but not for fat or protein contents . Venous blood samples were taken every 10 – 30 min to determine plasma glucose and insulin concentrations . On a subsequent visit , patients underwent a variable - target glucose clamp which titrated intravenous dextrose infusion rates in order to reproduce each individual’s postprandial glu - cose proﬁle as measured during his / her preliminary visit . An adaptive MPC system ( gMPC version 1 . 0 . 2 , University of Cambridge , UK ) was employed for this purpose . Participants were admitted after breakfast and fasted from 10 : 00 h . to 17 : 30 h . In this time period , intravenous insulin was delivered to obtain stable plasma glucose levels at 6 . 0 mmol / L ( Figure 8 . 1 ) . Starting from 17 : 30 h ( used here as the origin / reference time point here , i . e . t = 0 ) and until the cessation of the experiment at 02 : 00 h ( t = 510 min ) , intravenous insulin supply consisted of a constant basal delivery plus a variable infusion to mimic the systemic appearance of a subcutaneous bolus of rapid - acting insulin analogue with peak absorption at 50 min [ Wilinska et al . , 2005 ] . The total amount of insulin was adjusted for each subject’s requirements to match 121 g CHO . [ 6 , 6 - 2 H 2 ] glucose ( Cambridge Isotope Laboratories , USA ) was infused intravenously to EGP ﬂuxes , including the expected post - meal EGP suppression from 18 : 00 h ( i . e . t = 30 min ) . Therefore , [ 6 , 6 - 2 H 2 ] glucose served here as an EGP - mimicking tracer species ( abbreviated EM onwards ) . In addition , [ U - 13 C ; 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 6 - 2 H 7 ] glucose was infused to mimic the ex - pected appearance of glucose due to a standard meal ; thus functioning as a meal - mimicking ( MM ) tracer . For the sake of accuracy in measurement , both EM and MM infusion pat - terns were predeﬁned aiming to minimize changes over time in terms of tracer - to - tracee ratios ( TTRs ) [ Basu et al . , 2003 ; Haidar et al . , 2012 ] . Blood samples were immediately centrifuged and separated for later analysis . Plasma glucose was measured with an YSI2300 STAT Plus Analyzer ( YSI , UK ) ; whereas TTRs 126 8 .

[ 2002 , 2007 ] in order to correct for recycled glucose and spectra overlap [ Rosenblatt et al . , 1992 ] . Furthermore , a full description of the experimental protocol can be found in [ Elleri et al . , 2013a ] . 8 . 3 Modelling methodology 8 . 3 . 1 Model speciﬁcation Mass - balance dynamics for the infused EM and MM glucose tracers are respectively char - acterized here by a two - compartmental model , sharing a common structure between both modules ( see Figure 8 . 2 and Table 8 . 1 for nomenclature ) . In particular , the set of diﬀer - ential equations which govern the mass transfer ﬂuxes for the EM species – i . e . [ 6 , 6 - 2 H 2 ] glucose tracer – , are proposed as follows : d d tQ 1 , EM ( t ) = − [ k 01 ( t ) + k 21 ] Q 1 , EM ( t ) + k 12 Q 2 , EM ( t ) + U EM ( t ) ( 8 . 1 ) d d t Q 2 , EM ( t ) = k 21 Q 1 , EM ( t ) − [ k 02 ( t ) + k 12 ] Q 2 , EM ( t ) ( 8 . 2 ) Q 1 , EM ( t = 0 ) = Q 01 , EM ( 8 . 3 ) Q 2 , EM ( t = 0 ) = Q 02 , EM ( 8 . 4 ) with initial conditions as expressed in ( 8 . 3 ) – ( 8 . 4 ) .

For each species S , tracer masses in the accessible compartments ( i . e . Q 1 , S ) depend on : a ) the measured plasma tracer concentrations in plasma G S and b ) the distribution volume for glucose V G : G S ( t ) = Q 1 , S ( t ) V G ( 8 . 9 ) Nevertheless , two aspects distinguish equations for the MM species from the otherwise identical EM model , namely : • A multiplicative , dimensionless factor T DP applied to the infusion rate U MM in ( 8 . 5 ) , which accounts for diﬀerences in purity of the tracers dilution • Initial conditions in ( 8 . 7 ) – ( 8 . 8 ) , which are both ﬁxed to a zero value because the exogenous MM tracer started to be infused at t = 30 min in order to replicate the onset of the reproduced meal intake [ Elleri et al . , 2013a ] . Hence , except for T DP and initial conditions Q 01 , S , Q 02 , S in ( 8 . 3 ) – ( 8 . 4 ) , all other parameters are shared between both EM and MM blocks . In addition , it is assumed that non - insulin - dependent disposal ﬂuxes F 01 , S ( t ) from the accessible compartments are proportional to : a ) the total glucose disposal ﬂux F 01 , and b ) the tracer - to - tracee ratio of the corresponding species S , i . e . T T R S : F 01 , S ( t ) ∝ F 01 ( 8 . 10 ) F 01 , S ( t ) ∝ T T R S ( t ) = G S ( t ) G ( t ) ( 8 . 11 ) Consequently : F 01 , S ( t ) = F 01 · T T R S ( t ) = F 01 G S ( t ) G ( t ) ( 8 . 12 ) where a ) total plasma glucose concentration G ( t ) is determined experimentally and as - sumed free of measurement error for modelling purposes , and b ) F 01 represents the total glucose outﬂow , which is considered here as constant over time , constituting a model pa - rameter for each individual [ Hovorka et al . , 2002 ] . Making use of ( 8 . 9 ) and ( 8 . 12 ) , the fractional clearances or disposal rates k 01 , S ( t ) from the accessible compartments yield : k 01 , S ( t ) = F 01 , S ( t ) Q 1 , S ( t ) = F 01 ✘✘✘ G S ( t ) G ( t ) ✟✟ ✟✟ G S ( t ) V G = F 01 G ( t ) V G ( 8 . 13 ) regardless of the particular species S . For this reason , distinctions are not made between tracer disposal rates for EM or MM in ( 8 . 1 ) and ( 8 . 5 ) . For the purpose of modelling the role of insulin on the clearance of glucose tracers , a remote eﬀect variable X ( t ) is deﬁned through a single - compartmental model with initial condition X 0 at t = 0 : d d t X ( t ) = − k A X ( t ) + k A S I I ( t ) ( 8 . 14 ) X ( t = 0 ) = X 0 ( 8 . 15 ) Magnitude X ( t ) modulates the disposal rates k 02 ( t ) from the non - accessible compartments of glucose tracer masses Q 2 , S . Two types of remote eﬀects are considered here for their evaluation : 129 8 . 3 . Modelling methodology • First an approach in which the disposal rate directly equals X ( t ) , onwards referred to as ‘linear’ formulation : k 02 ( t ) = X ( t ) ( 8 . 16 ) • Alternatively , a second option is evaluated in which the fractional clearance k 02 ( t ) varies in proportion to changes in X ( t ) , but only above a certain threshold X C ; whereas on the contrary , disposal is totally suppressed below such value X C : k 02 ( t ) = ( X ( t ) − X C if X ( t ) − X C ≥ 0 0 otherwise ( 8 . 17 ) or using an equivalent formulation for compactness : k 02 ( t ) = R [ X ( t ) − X C ] ( 8 . 18 ) where R [ · ] denotes the ramp function . This behaviour is onwards referred to as ‘cut - oﬀ’ activation . Besides , the suitability of diﬀerent forms of initial conditions for ( 8 . 3 ) , ( 8 . 4 ) and ( 8 . 15 ) are investigated . In the ﬁrst place , the assumption of steady - state conditions for X ( t ) at t = 0 would impose : d d tX ( t = 0 ) = 0 ⇒ X 0 = S I I 0 ( 8 . 19 ) where I 0 is the insulin concentration measured experimentally at start time ( t = 0 ) , and where S I represents insulin sensitivity to the disposal of glucose tracers ( Table 8 . 1 ) . For the ‘linear’ remote eﬀect , ( 8 . 19 ) implies that the disposal rates k 02 ( t ) from the non - accessible compartments at time t = 0 would equal : k 02 ( t = 0 ) = X 0 ( 8 . 20 ) Alternatively , for the ‘cut - oﬀ’ approach it is obtained : k 02 ( t = 0 ) = R h X 0 − X C i ( 8 . 21 ) Steady - state initial conditions for the EM tracer masses can also be solved algebraically , yielding : dd t Q 1 , EM ( t = 0 ) = 0 d d t Q 2 , EM ( t = 0 ) = 0 ) ⇒    Q 01 , EM = k 02 ( t = 0 ) + k 12 [ k 02 ( t = 0 ) + k 12 ] h F 01 G 0 V G + k 21 i − k 12 k 21 U 0 EM Q 01 , EM = k 21 [ k 02 ( t = 0 ) + k 12 ] h F 01 G 0 VG + k 21 i − k 12 k 21 U 0 EM ( 8 . 22 ) where : i ) U 0 EM represents the infusion rate for the EM tracer at t = 0 as employed in the experiments , ii ) G 0 is the total glucose concentration measured at start time ; and iii ) k 02 ( t = 0 ) is obtained either from ( 8 . 20 ) or from ( 8 . 21 ) , whichever is applicable depending on the assumed behaviour for X ( t ) ( linear or cut - oﬀ ) . A substitutive to the steady - state assumption consists in taking Q 01 , EM , Q 02 , EM and X 0 as extra model parameters . This option implies to consider that the metabolic system is in a non - steady situation ( i . e . d / d t 6 = 0 ) at the onset of the experiment ( t = 0 ) . Furthermore , a mixed case is also proposed here , in which the remote eﬀect of insulin X ( t ) is considered in steady - state but the EM tracer masses are not . Thus , Q 01 , EM , Q 02 , EM become model parame - ters , whereas the condition from either ( 8 . 20 ) or ( 8 . 21 ) does apply although ( 8 . 22 ) does not . 130 8 . Metabolic model for the eﬀect of insulin on the disposal of meal glucose in T1D In summary , this work explores : a ) two diﬀerent conﬁgurations for the remote eﬀect X ( t ) of insulin on glucose disposal : either ‘linear’ ( L ) or with ‘cut - oﬀ’ ( C ) ; along with b ) three alternative assumptions for the initial conditions of EM masses and remote eﬀect : ‘steady - state’ ( S ) , as model ‘parameters’ ( P ) , or with a ‘mixed’ situation ( M ) between steady - state and parameters . Therefore , a total of six model combinations are evaluated and compared here , namely : LS ( linear remote eﬀect plus steady - state initial conditions ) , CS ( cut - oﬀ activation of X plus steady - state ) , LM ( linear plus mixed initial conditions ) , CM ( cut - oﬀ behaviour plus mixed ) , LP ( linear plus initial conditions as model parameters ) and CP ( cut - oﬀ plus parameters ) . All models verify a priori identiﬁability conditions [ Carson et al . , 1983 ; Cobelli and Carson , 2008 ] . 8 . 3 . 2 Parameter estimation For the purpose of estimating model parameters , measurement errors were assumed here to be normally distributed with zero mean . Errors associated with the measurement of the EGP - mimicking [ 6 , 6 - 2 H 2 ] glucose tracer were modeled as multiplicative with coeﬃ - cient of variation ( CV ) equal to 5 % [ Haidar et al . , 2012 ] . Correspondingly , errors for the meal - mimicking [ U - 13 C ; 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 6 - 2 H 7 ] glucose tracer were assumed multiplicative with CV = 5 % for concentrations greater than 0 . 02 mmol / L , and otherwise additive with zero mean and standard deviation 0 . 001 mmol / L . This additive error was determined empiri - cally and signiﬁes that , at low concentrations , instrumentation has precision independent of the measured value . Model parameters were estimated by means of an iterative two - stage ( ITS ) population kinetics analysis [ Steimer et al . , 1984 ; Hovorka and Vicini , 2001 ] using SAAM II soft - ware ( The Epsilon Group , USA ) . After a preliminary parameter ﬁtting for each individual – initialization stage – , ITS population analysis performed an Expectation - Maximization es - timation , consisting of two steps : i ) a parameter estimation procedure – Expectation step – including a Bayesian term which penalizes deviations from the current population - based mean estimate , weighted by the reciprocal of the population - based variance of parame - ters [ Steimer et al . , 1984 ] ; and ii ) an update of population statistics – Maximization step – in accordance to the outcome of the current parameter ﬁtting . This iterative procedure was repeated until convergence , which was assumed to occur when consecutive parameter estimates diﬀered by < 1 % . 8 . 3 . 3 Model identiﬁcation and validation Parameter estimates were checked for physiological plausibility against reference values from previously validated studies in T1D subjects [ Hovorka et al . , 2002 ] . Posterior identiﬁ - ability of each parameter was assessed by means of the accuracy of its estimate , considering the estimation as satisfactory if the CV was below 75 % , acceptable in the range 75 – 100 % , and non - identiﬁable if CV > 100 % . Runs tests ( one - sample Wald - Wolfowitz ) were performed to ascertain the randomness of each model’s weighted residuals of ﬁtting [ Wald and Wolfowitz , 1940 ] . 131 8 . 4 . Results Figure 8 . 3 : Plasma tracer concentrations over time in the accessible compartments for the EGP - mimicking tracer ( panel a ) and the meal - mimicking tracer ( panel b ) , measured during the variable - target glucose clamp experiments reproducing either a HG or LG evening meal . Values are depicted as mean ± SEM ( n = 8 ) . 8 . 3 . 4 Model selection The principle of parsimony was employed here to identify which of the six models best represented experimental observations , balancing on the one side the accuracy of the curves ﬁtted to data – assessed by means of the weighted residual sum of squares – , and on the other hand the number of model parameters . Akaike ( AIC ) and Bayesian ( BIC ) information criteria were computed by SAAM II software . Models should ideally minimize those scores . 8 . 4 Results 8 . 4 . 1 Experimental data Baseline characteristics for the two meal - type groups were statistically comparable : 3 / 5 females / males , age 20 . 8 ± 3 . 3 years , BMI 24 . 0 ± 1 . 5 kg / m 2 , HbA 1c 8 . 7 ± 1 . 5 % , diabetes du - ration 7 . 1 ( 2 . 9 – 20 . 9 ) years and total daily insulin 0 . 8 ± 0 . 2 U · kg − 1 · day − 1 for the group in which the LG meal was reproduced ; versus 4 / 4 females / males , age 18 . 1 ± 4 . 0 years , BMI 22 . 8 ± 1 . 2 kg / m 2 , HbA 1c 8 . 7 ± 2 . 0 % , diabetes duration 7 . 4 ( 3 . 6 – 11 . 2 ) years and total daily in - sulin 0 . 9 ± 0 . 1 U · kg − 1 · day − 1 for the HG meal group . Results are all expressed as mean ± SD , except diabetes duration which is as median ( inter - quartile range ) . The variable - target glucose clamp achieved by the University of Cambridge’s adaptive MPC controller replicated satisfactorily those individual glucose proﬁles obtained during the preliminary visit [ Elleri et al . , 2013a ] . Average plasma tracer concentrations in the accessible compartments G EM ( t ) , G MM ( t ) are depicted in Figure 8 . 3 . 8 . 4 . 2 Model identiﬁcation , validation and selection Table 8 . 2 summarizes the results obtained for the procedures of model identiﬁcation and validation . All six models showed physiological plausibility , although two of them – LM and LP – yielded values for the F 01 parameter ( ∼ 4 µ mol / kg · min − 1 , Table 8 . 3 ) which lie 132 8 .

Posterior identiﬁability was satisfactory , with CV < 75 % in all parameter estimates ( Table 8 . 4 ) . However , in three occasions the ITS population ﬁtting process resulted in either one parameter ( F 01 for the LM model ) or two parameters ( F 01 plus X 0 for the LP model ; Q 02 , EM and X 0 for CP ) becoming ﬁxed by converging to an identical estimated value for all subjects . Weighted residuals of model ﬁts are depicted in Figure 8 . 4 . In addition to the average weighted residual at each time point , their root - mean - square ( rms ) value was also computed in order to quantify the variability of residuals across individual proﬁles . Furthermore , Runs tests were applied to the series of weighted residuals . Table 8 . 2 presents the fraction of cases which passed the test , meaning whenever the null hypothesis ( which represents the randomness of residuals ) could not be rejected with 95 % conﬁdence ( i . e . p < 0 . 05 ) . Based on the principle of parsimony and accounting for AIC and BIC scores , the model with highest overall a posteriori identiﬁability was CM , hence best representing these ex - perimental data . CM also showed the tightest weighted residuals , both in terms of mean and rms values ( Figure 8 . 4 ) . An example curve ﬁt to data as generated by the CM model is depicted in Figure 8 . 5 . Finally , neither independent t - tests nor Mann - Whitney tests ( i . e . their non - parametric counterparts ) found any statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the HG , LG subgroups in terms of the values for any of the model parameters as ﬁtted by CM . 8 . 5 Discussion A number of works in literature studied glucose absorption patterns in healthy individuals after the intake of glucose [ Dalla Man et al . , 2006 , 2007 ; Toﬀolo et al . , 2008 ] or meals [ Wachters - Hagedoorn et al . , 2006 , 2007 ; Priebe et al . , 2008 ] . Recently , a clamp experiment addressed mixed meals with complex CHO in patients with T1D [ Elleri et al . , 2013a ] . Using data from this experiment by Elleri et al . [ 2013a ] , this works covers the modelling of a remote eﬀect of plasma insulin concentrations on the disposal of meal - attributable glucose , a phenomenon which had not been addressed previously . Six mechanistic models were proposed to characterize mathematically the clearance regimes of EGP - and meal - mimicking glucose tracers from the non - accessible compartments rep - resenting interstitium , among other tissues . These six non - linear models comprised mass - balance diﬀerential equations for the EM and MM tracer species with a common two - 133 8 . 5 .

Metabolic model for the eﬀect of insulin on the disposal of meal glucose in T1D compartmental structure for each , as well as a remote eﬀect X ( t ) of plasma insulin con - centration on the disposal rate k 02 ( t ) from the non - accessible compartments with masses Q 2 , S . In all models , the non - insulin - dependent disposal ﬂux F 01 , S ( t ) from the accessible compartments Q 1 , S was assumed to be proportional to both the total ﬂux F 01 and the corresponding tracer - to - tracee ratio T T R S . A dimensionless parameter T DP was incor - porated to U MM ( t ) in order to account for variations in the purity of tracer dilutions . Diﬀerences among the six models resided in two aspects : a ) whether the disposal rate k 02 ( t ) was assumed to be ‘linear’ with the remote eﬀect X ( t ) or if , conversely , disposal was activated only above a certain ‘cut - oﬀ’ value X C ; and b ) in the type of initial conditions for various diﬀerential equations ( if steady - state was assumed , or a fully non - steady case with all initial conditions taken as model parameters , or an intermediate case with X ( t ) in steady state but not masses Q 1 , EM , Q 2 , EM ) . Models were evaluated in terms of their ability to ﬁt experimental data from n = 16 young individuals with T1D who underwent a variable - target clamp to replicate glucose proﬁles observed after LG or HG evening meals containing complex CHO . All six models were a priori identiﬁable and also proved a posteriori identiﬁability , with remarkable precision of parameter estimates , as shown by the low CVs obtaines ( Table 8 . 4 ) . Nevertheless , three models converged to either one or two ﬁxed values for certain parameters , an issue which may suggest suboptimal or inadequate ﬁts , possibly due to an undesired convergence to local optima by the ITS numerical algorithm . In general terms , the three models with a ‘cut - oﬀ’ activation of X ( t ) behaved better than their corresponding ‘linear’ counterpart with the same type of initial conditions . Overall , the best ﬁt to data ( i . e . the one with smallest weighted residuals and lowest AIC and BIC scores ) was obtained by the CM model . Of note , the X C threshold was well supported by data , with CV = 42 . 33 ( 31 . 34 – 65 . 34 ) % ( n = 16 ) [ median ( inter - quartile range ) ] . Besides , proﬁles for both EM and MM tracer concentrations were accurately reconstructed by the CM model , with weighted residuals having passed all Runs tests and therefore not showing systematic deviations from randomness . In addition to the ‘cut - oﬀ’ remote eﬀect of insulin on disposal , CM comprised steady - state conditions for the compartment X ( t ) representing this remote eﬀect , although not for the masses of the EM tracer species . This behaviour could be originated in the particular time course of the experimental protocol used here , in which insulin had been infused for seven hours prior to the onset of the clamp ( Figure 8 . 1 ) ; whereas the EM tracer had been infused for two hours [ Elleri et al . , 2013a ] and a tran - sient might still be present at t = 0 . Figure 8 . 3 ( panel a ) supports this idea , depicting EM concentration proﬁles which do not remain ﬂat at t = 0 , but instead peak around t ∼ 30 min ) . Given the complexity of the study , the experiments did not replicate both types of meals on the same population of patients . However , subjects’ characteristics were very similar between the two populations , with a therefore limited impact on the outcomes . A ﬁnal consideration should be made concerning the applicability of the mechanistic metabolic model derived here for the kinetics of meal - attributable glucose . This model could be in - tegrated into the in silico simulation of meals [ Wilinska et al . , 2009 ; Magni et al . , 2009 ; Clarke et al . , 2009 ; Grosman et al . , 2010 ; Turksoy et al . , 2013 ] , which may in turn be used to test and optimize postprandial insulin infusion regimes aiming to restrain meal - induced glucose excursions . The model could be as well applied in the context of MPC control algorithms for the artiﬁcial pancreas in T1D [ Hovorka , 2011 ] . 137 8 . 5 . Discussion 138 Part V Conclusions 139 Chapter 9 Conclusions 9 . 1 Veriﬁcation of hypotheses and summary of results H1 : In the context of type 1 diabetes , it is possible to determine distinctive physiological responses to exercise of varying intensity and modality , and in particular to quantify their eﬀects in terms of the associated acute variations in glycaemia . Hypothesis partially conﬁrmed . In this PhD thesis work , two novel rate - of - change magnitudes RoC E , RoC R were deﬁned to characterize in a systematic , quantitative manner the acute exercise - induced variations observed in T1D patients’ glycaemia as a response to various types of physical activity , during exercise and in the immediately subsequent early recovery stage . On this basis , a systematic review and meta - analysis was conduced to aggregate the avail - able scientiﬁc evidence . To avoid introducing bias , glucose proﬁles were detrended at a study level ( prior to the pooling ) , hence discounting background spurious trends at - tributable to factors other than exercise itself . Random - eﬀect DerSimonian & Laird statis - tical meta - analyses were carried out , ﬁrst with a resting control period ( REST ) as reference , plus direct comparisons between pairs of exercise modalities – when feasible in terms of pub - lications availing – . Continuous exercise at sustained , moderate intensities ( CONT ) – with predominantly aer - obic contributions – was found to be associated with the most rapid decays in glycaemia during exercise , at an average rate of RoC E { CONT vs . REST } = − 4 . 43 mmol / L · h − 1 ; and mild recoveries afterwards , with mean RoC R { CONT vs . REST } = + 0 . 70 mmol / L · h − 1 . Resistance exercise ( RESIST ) – with notable anaerobic contributions – showed more con - strained average decays and recoveries than CONT : RoC E { RESIST vs . CONT } = + 2 . 86 mmol / L · h − 1 , RoC R { RESIST vs . CONT } = − 2 . 40 mmol / L · h − 1 . However , quantitative discrepancies in RoCs and conﬂicting evidence ( e . g . in terms of the occurrence of noctur - nal post - exercise hypoglycaemia events ) were encountered regarding the magnitude of the eﬀect of intermittent high - intensity exercise ( IHE ) . H2 : It is possible to achieve an accurate , reliable and robust monitoring of physical activity intensity and modality in free - living conditions by the simultaneous processing of multi - modal data which combine accelerometry and heart rate measurements , as well as by the application of machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in data . Hypothesis conﬁrmed . 141 9 . 1 . Veriﬁcation of hypotheses and summary of results Data were collected in two diﬀerent scenarios : i ) a laboratory environment comprising ﬁxed exercise circuit protocols in a ﬁtness center , with tight schedules and intensities , and under direct supervision by the research team ; and additionally , ii ) in ambulatory free - living conditions which included a notable variety of self - selected physical activities , as well as resting periods , daily life activities and the use of means of transportation . These data were used to train and validate a ML - based system for the classiﬁcation of time periods in terms of their PA intensity ( either low , moderate or vigorous ) and – for the case of vigorous episodes – also their exercise modality ( sustained aerobic , resistance and mixed ) . In this regard , ML techniques provided a sound framework for the extraction of relevant patterns in multi - modal signals : biaxial accelerometry , step count and HR . A pipeline of ML schemes was proposed , including : a ) Feature deﬁnition . A total of 42 time - domain statistical descriptors were deﬁned to characterize the evolution of signals along the basic unit of analysis : a 2 - min window , whose duration was selected preliminarily in order to balance descriptiveness and time granularity . b ) Dimensionality reduction to overcome the so - called ‘curse of dimensionality’ . In this manner , the number of features considered was decreased – and hence , the complexity of the automated learning task – while maintaining as much relevant information in signals as possible . To do so , various methodologies were explored , ranging from the extraction of new features by linear combination of the original ones ( PCA or LDA projections ) to ‘ﬁlter’ - and ‘wrapper’ - based feature selection . c ) Identiﬁcation of patterns in data , either by clustering algorithms – employed here as ‘smart’ vector quantization procedures – or by means of supervised classiﬁers . This PhD thesis work covered a considerable variety of state - of - the - art algorithms – both in clustering and classiﬁcation set - ups – with diverse underlying mathematical principles and computational complexities : from relatively simple K - means or logistic regression schemes to compound classiﬁcation ensembles ( Bagging or Boosting ) . d ) Temporal ﬁltering to exploit information about sustained long - term trends and redun - dancies in the time course of data . A Markovian process modelling was undertaken , making use of HMM capabilities to relate an observable process ( i . e . the identiﬁed patterns ) with a hidden process , in this case the sequence of PA classes which most likely generated the given sequence of observations . This ML framework was used to select a combination of schemes which yielded best values for a custom performance metric , which – given the notable class imbalance present in the dataset – was formulated to reﬂect overall accuracy in recognition , as well as achievements in under - represented PA classes ( i . e . moderate and vigorous ) . As a result of this model selec - tion procedure , the combination ‘wrapper’ - based feature selection ( genetic search , Bagging - speciﬁc wrapper ) plus Bagging as classiﬁcation algorithm showed highest performance scores in PA intensity and modality recognition . Besides , good robustness and general - ization capabilities were observed ( especially for the LDA + K - means scheme ) through the LOSOCV procedure , in which data sequences from all but one participant were used in turns for the training of the classiﬁer and data from the remaining subject were used for testing purposes . This aspect points out that overﬁtting is unlikely to have occurred . Fur - thermore , the proposed classiﬁers outperformed notably the domain - speciﬁc standard PA intensity classiﬁcation approaches ( ‘cutpoint’ - based , i . e . by thresholding [ Freedson et al . , 1998 ; Sasaki et al . , 2011 ] ) , specially in the recognition of static resistance exercise not in - volving waist movements , where the accelerometer was attached . This improvement was facilitated by the incorporation of HR to provide information physiological responses to exercise by the cardiovascular system . In addition , the proposed classiﬁers also outper - 142 9 . Conclusions formed clearly baseline ML schemes established for comparison purposes ( naïve Bayes and CART decision trees ) , which worked on data combining accelerometry and HR measure - ments . On the other hand , scores for the task of PA modality recognition were also notably satisfactory : ∼ 98 % . In terms of the temporal behaviour of classiﬁcation outcomes , thanks to the incorporation of the HMM , most errors were observed to appear consistently as short - duration mis - matches , specially around transients , e . g . with quick ﬂuctuations in the ground truth due to the short - interval circuit training protocol in the laboratory environment . However , these ﬂuctuations are infrequent in real free - living scenarios , with classiﬁcation errors ex - pected therefore to have a low impact in terms of eventual decays in the overall accuracy , robustness and reliability in the ambulatory 24 h - based PA monitoring . H3 : It is possible to generate a mechanistic mathematical model which de - scribes the eﬀect of insulin on prandial glucose - insulin kinetics in type 1 diabetes . Hypothesis conﬁrmed . The role of insulin on the clearance of meal - attributable glucose had not yet been addressed explicitly by prevailing T1D patient models . To do so , this work made use of data obtained by the Institute of Metabolic Science ( University of Cambridge , UK ) during a variable - target glucose clamp conceived to study and replicate the absorption patterns of common mixed meals with complex CHO for n = 16 young patients with T1D . Glucose ﬂuxes were determined in a virtually model - independent manner by means of a triple tracer technique in which the expected post - prandial EGP reduction and appearance of meal glucose were mimicked via the tritration of infusion regimes for the glucose tracers . Based on those experimental data , various compartmental models were proposed here to describe mechanistically – via mass - balance diﬀerential equations – the clearance of glucose tracers from non - accessible compartments , and in particular , the role of plasma insulin concentrations on disposal rates . Six non - linear models were studied , diﬀering in : a ) the form of the remote eﬀect of insulin – either following a ‘linear’ behaviour of with ‘cut - oﬀ’ activation above a certain threshold value X C – , and b ) in the type of initial conditions for the diﬀerential equations : i . e . steady - state assumed or not . All models were a priori identiﬁable and showed notable precision of the ﬁtted parameter values , in physiological ranges comparable to previous experiments [ Hovorka et al . , 2002 ] . Attending to physi - ological plausibility , ﬁtting residuals and parsimony criteria ( AIC , BIC ) , the model best explaining the experimental observations was selected . This model CM encompassed a ‘cut - oﬀ’ behaviour for the remote eﬀect of insulin on the clearance of meal - attributable glucose , as well as initial conditions characterized by a mixed situation : steady - state for the insulin compartment ; but oppositely , non - steady for the masses of the tracer mimicking EGP . This interaction between insulin concentrations and the clearance of meal - attributable glu - cose ( which had not been described before ) can be incorporated to the current physiological T1D patient models . This enhancement can in turn improve the in silico simulation of pran - dial periods , which may be useful for the tailoring of meal bolus regimes and in closed - loop control ( i . e . the artiﬁcial pancreas ) . 143 9 . 2 . Future works 9 . 2 Future works 9 . 2 . 1 Physical activity monitoring Commercial accelerometers , such as ActiGraph’s devices used here or SenseWear armbands , are widely extended and consolidated in sport sciences and in the professional PA moni - toring . These equipments have a major advantage in the considerable amount of published evidence [ Bassett et al . , 2000 ; Hendelman et al . , 2000 ; Welk et al . , 2004 , 2007 ; Sasaki et al . , 2011 ] concerning their ﬁeld validation and assessing their accuracy . However , their internal proprietary processing algorithms to generate ‘activity counts’ prevent researchers from having full control of the raw accelerometry signal : during this procedure , signal is sum - marized by the computation of counts , discarding potentially very valuable information such as the detailed waveform or its spectral content . Newer commercial PA monitoring devices – e . g . Zephyr [ Johnstone et al . , 2012a , b , c ] – are starting to shift away from this ‘counts paradigm’ in favour of raw accelerometry signals . Besides , they incorporate the recording of other relevant physiological magnitudes : not only HR , but also ventilation or body temperature . On the other hand , the high penetration of accelerometer - enabled smartphones provides access to aﬀordable monitoring devices , which patients are accustomed to carry with them . Hence , the use of smartphones as PA tracking systems is very promising , added to the fact that manufacturers of HR monitoring equipments have commenced to adopt stan - dard wireless communication protocols which smartphones can implement ( e . g . Bluetooth , Bluetooth Low Energy or ANT + ) . Scientiﬁc literature is slowly starting to show research eﬀorts in this line [ Gyllensten and Bonomi , 2011 ; Bort - Roig et al . , 2014 ] , although the use of commercial , validated equipment is still markedly dominant . The automatic ML - based PA recognition schemes proposed in this work are ﬂexible as to accommodate the handling of raw accelerometry signals ; although a number of adaptations would be required : a ) Signal preprocessing should be drastically modiﬁed in order to adapt to the particular nature of raw accelerometry , notably diﬀerent from counts . This would include , for example , band - pass ﬁltering to discard the gravity component in acceleration and high - frequency noise . b ) Feature deﬁnition should be enhanced to capture additional information available : spectral analysis and / or wavelets , characteristics describing signal morphology or variability of times between consecutive heartbeats , among others . c ) Attention should be paid to the adjustment of the computational demands of prepro - cessing and classiﬁcation schemes to match the capabilities of smartphones , balancing the complexity of the algorithms to prevent overloading the processor or eventual bat - tery drains , among other issues . d ) New data collection experiments would also be required to train the ML systems . In this sense , part of the work along this PhD thesis was devoted to the coaching of several MSc theses – mainly González Martín [ 2013 ] – developing preliminary prototypes in this line . Work is still pending in various manners ; in the improvement and veriﬁcation of preprocess - ing schemes , in the selection of ML algorithms and hyperparameter values , or in performing an exhaustive validation of the system . Open issues exist regarding the accuracy , validity and reproducibility of accelerometry measurements inter - and intra - device . In this regard , disparities in terms of the available sampling frequencies have been detected , along with 144 9 . Conclusions unequal ranges of measurement even for the same hardware ( i . e . identical accelerometer microchip model ) , which are due to operating system conﬁguration details . 9 . 2 . 2 Physical activity modelling in T1D PA has not yet been thoroughly addressed from the perspective of producing physiologically grounded mathematical models to describe its eﬀects on glucose homoeostasis in T1D . In this sense , the three models presented by Dalla Man et al . [ 2009 ] were conceived to replicate exercise - induced decays in glucose , as observed for T1D patients during moderate - intensity sustained PA . Therefore , these models cannot reﬂect other known physiological responses to exercise , such as hyperglycaemia episodes induced by very vigorous bouts which produce an exacerbated release of catecholamines Marliss and Vranic [ 2002 ] ; Lumb and Gallen [ 2009 ] . Consequently , further research is needed to generate mechanistic models covering more physiological aspects of PA in T1D , in particular its interaction with glucose homoeostasis . Until now , a critical limiting factor has been the lack of experimental data on which to formulate and validate such models . Ideally , tracer experiments should be conduced in a similar manner to the one described in chapter 8 to investigate meal absorption . How - ever , the design of those experiments may encompass theoretical and practical limitations , including complex issues such as pre - establishing infusion regimes which maintain the ex - pected tracer - to - tracee ratios approximately stable , or the number of tracer isotopes needed to identify univocally the relevant ﬂuxes , among others . 9 . 2 . 3 Physical activity into artiﬁcial pancreas systems Artiﬁcial pancreas systems in T1D – currently under development stages or undergoing pre - liminary clinical trials – do not yet incorporate the explicit consideration of PA as a source of changes in glucose - insulin kinetics for T1D . In this sense , a ﬁrst possibility to integrate PA into the closed - loop glucose controllers would be through physiologically detailed , white - box descriptive models embedded in MPC algorithms , with the limitations of modelling PA discussed above . Another option could be through black - box approaches , e . g . a MLP neural network trained to predict exercise - induced trends in glycaemia without the need for explicit physiological knowledge . In literature , various pilot studies have been conduced on T1D patients performing exercise during the period in which glycaemia was controlled . However , either PA was not tackled speciﬁcally – i . e . not considering that changes in glycaemia may be induced by PA – , or simple intuitive approached were followed . Among the second family of approaches , Sten - erson et al . [ 2015 ] used a Kalman ﬁlter to predict glucose values 30 min ahead , suspending the infusion of insulin by the pump : a ) for predictions below 80 mg / dL ( 4 . 44 mmol / L ) , in the case of high accelerometry values were measured ; or b ) for HR above 90 beats / min in combination with glycaemia below 180 mg / dL ( 10 . 0 mmol / L ) and decreasing . Similarly , Breton et al . [ 2014 ] used a Kalman ﬁlter to predict hypoglycaemia risk , taking corrective actions – reductions in insulin infusion – in accordance to such risk . To accommodate exer - cise , the estimation of this hypoglycaemia risk was increased in relation to HR values in excess of resting , basal HR . In summary , the strategies explored until now in literature for the integration of the manage - ment of PA into artiﬁcial pancreas systems can be characterized by their relative simplicity . Whereas the glucose - lowering eﬀect of sustained moderate PA is taken into consideration , rises originated by vigorous bouts are not . Besides , actions taken by the controller are 145 9 . 3 . Contributions and achievements governed by simple rules : thresholds on accelerometry outcomes and / or HR [ Stenerson et al . , 2015 ] , or increased hypoglycaemia risks [ Breton et al . , 2014 ] . Therefore , there is considerable room for research on the integration of PA into the artiﬁcial pancreas , which can in turn beneﬁt from improvements in the monitoring of PA ( reliable determination of its intensity and modality / predominant metabolic pathway ) and in the modelling of its eﬀect on glucose - insulin dynamics . 9 . 3 Contributions and achievements 9 . 3 . 1 Publications Journal articles • F .

A . 1 Feature extraction This type of procedures aim to reduce the dimensionality of the original feature space by means of linear combinations of features , projecting data onto a subspace with less at - tributes than the input . Those projection are devised to retain as much relevant information as possible by discarding redundancy in highly correlated features . A . 1 . 1 Principal Component Analysis The linear combination proposed by Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) is optimized to retain as much variance as possible in the projected subspace . Such a formulation is equivalent to ﬁnding a set of orthogonal directions along which data observations are maximally spread [ Rencher and Christensen , 2012 ] . In this manner , when there are features which show strong correlations to each other , most of the total variability present in the dataset can be covered by just a few of the ﬁrst components found by PCA [ Rencher and Christensen , 2012 ] . Algebraic formulation Given the dataset D = n ~ x i ∈ X ⊂ R d o n i = 1 containing n instances or observations in a d - dimensional feature space , whose sample mean ~ m X and covariance matrix S X are respec - tively : ~ m X = 1 n n X i = 1 ~ x i ( A . 1 ) S X = 1 n − 1 n X i = 1 ( ~ x i − ~ m X ) ( ~ x i − ~ m X ) T ( A . 2 ) Let us consider scalar magnitudes z i computed as the linear combination of feature values from each sample vector ~ x i ∈ D belonging to the dataset D . More precisely , a centred version of data ~ x i − ~ m X should be used instead in order to obtain outcomes with zero 151 A . 1 . Feature extraction mean . For simplicity reasons and compactness in notation , the linear combination can be speciﬁed via a projection vector ~ e which governs the relative weight of each feature , i . e . : z i = ~ e · ( ~ x i − ~ m X ) = ~ e T ( ~ x i − ~ m X ) ∀ i = 1 , . . . , n ( A . 3 ) With this projection , it can be proved [ Rencher and Christensen , 2012 ] that the resulting set of z i values has sample variance s Z equalling : s Z = ~ e T S X ~ e ( A . 4 ) However , it is not convenient to try to maximize s Z in ( A . 4 ) , since it is a not bounded magnitude unless the norm k ~ e k 2 = ~ e T ~ e is restricted . Therefore , the aim of PCA must instead be to maximize a normalized version λ : λ = ~ e T S X ~ e ~ e T ~ e ( A . 5 ) It can also be proved [ Rencher and Christensen , 2012 ] that maxima for ( A . 5 ) are found by solving the following eigenvalue problem : ( S X − λI ) ~ e = 0 ( A . 6 ) Geometric interpretation Without loss of generality , let us assume that the cloud of points { ~ x i ∈ D } ni = 1 resembles an hyperellipsoid in R d . If features are correlated , then this hyperellipsoid does not have its natural orientation axes aligned with the coordinate axes ( Figure A . 1 ) . With this idea in mind , PCA can be interpreted as the procedure to ﬁnd those natural axes . Let us ﬁrst carry out a translation of the new coordinate system to point ~ m X in order to have the cloud centred around the origin of coordinates . Let us also apply a rotation operation , deﬁned by a d × d square matrix A ; where A is orthogonal , hence fulﬁlling A T A = I . In this new coordinate system , a certain data sample vector ~ x i ∈ D would therefore be transformed into vector ~ z i where : ~ z i = A ( ~ x i − ~ m X ) ( A . 7 ) For data rotated in this manner , mean and covariance yield [ Rencher and Christensen , 2012 ] : ~ m Z = 0 ( A . 8 ) S Z = AS X A T ( A . 9 ) The aim of this rotation procedure resides in having features in ~ z which are uncorrelated . This in turn implies a covariance matrix S Z will all - zero elements outside the main diagonal : S Z =   s 2 Z 1 . . . 0 s 2 Z j 0 . . . s 2 Z d   ( A . 10 ) Hence , from ( A . 9 ) and ( A . 10 ) it follows that matrix A diagonalizes S X ; where λ j are the eigenvalues of S X : λ j = s 2 Z j ∀ j = 1 , . . . , d ( A . 11 ) 152 A . Mathematical foundations Figure A . 1 : Schematic depiction of an example PCA procedure in a two - dimensional feature space . In panel a ( left ) the two variables x 1 , x 2 are clearly correlated , with the point cloud resembling an ellipse with an oblique orientation of its natural axes . Standard deviations s X 1 , s X 2 have comparable values . In panel b ( center ) , axes are translated and rotated following PCA results to get the dataset represented in a new coordinate system , as shown in panel c ( right ) . The ﬁrst projected feature z 1 carries notably more variance – and hence , more information according to PCA principles – than z 2 and x 1 . and where the rows of A correspond to the transposed version of the eigenvectors (cid:22)e j for S X ( normalized to be (cid:27) (cid:22)e j (cid:27) = 1 ) . As a result of these PCA operations , the scalar value z j is said to be the j - th principal component of (cid:22)x : z j = (cid:22)e T j (cid:22)x ( A . 12 ) By convention , eigenvalues are ordered from largest to lowest : λ 1 ≥ . . . ≥ λ j ≥ . . . ≥ λ d ≥ 0 ( A . 13 ) The fraction f PCA of total variance in data which can be covered by the ﬁrst d PCA principal components is stated as follows : f PCA = (cid:31) d PCA i = 1 λ j (cid:31) di = 1 λ j ( A . 14 ) In this regard , when there are highly correlated features , the ﬁrst eigenvalues are much larger than the rest . Thus , most of the total variability can be explained by just a few principal components – i . e . d PCA (cid:26) d – , a property which justiﬁes the use of PCA for dimensionality reduction . Normally , the number d PCA of selected components is established as the minimum to cover a certain fraction of total variance , e . g . f PCA = 80 % , 90 % , 95 % or 99 % . PCA from the correlation matrix The original deﬁnition of PCA relies in the calculation of eigenvectors from the sample covariance matrix S X . However , taking instead the correlation matrix R X can be more convenient in certain situations [ Rencher and Christensen , 2012 ] ; especially when variances s 2 X i diﬀer excessively from one feature to another , or if the units of measurement are not commensurate . In those cases , the eigenvector analysis of S X is strongly dominated by vari - ables with large variance and high scales ; whereas the remaining features would contribute very little despite potentially carrying useful information . 153 A . 1 . Feature extraction A . 1 . 2 Linear Discriminant Analysis PCA is conceived to retain as much variance from data as possible after projection . There - fore , PCA is unsupervised , in the sense that it does not utilize information about ground truth class assignments . Oppositely , Linear Discriminant Analysis ( LDA ) exploits those ground truth class correspondences in order to ﬁnd the linear combination of features which maximizes the separability of classes in the newly projected space . LDA for binary problems For clarity , let us ﬁrst address a binary problem with two classes ω 0 , ω 1 under consid - eration . Given the dataset D = n ( ~ x i , y i ) | ~ x i ∈ X ⊂ R d , y i ∈ Y = { 0 , 1 } o n i = 1 containing n d - dimensional data instances ~ x i and their paired ground truth class assignments y i , with n 0 samples belonging to class ω 0 and the remaining n 1 = n − n 0 instances to ω 1 ; sample means ~ m X 0 , ~ m X 1 and the scatter matrices ˜ S X 0 , ˜ S X 1 for each class are calculated as follows : ~ m X 0 = 1 n 0 X ~ x i | y i ∈ ω 0 ~ x i ( A . 15 ) ~ m X 1 = 1 n 1 X ~ x i | y i ∈ ω 1 ~ x i ( A . 16 ) ˜ S X 0 = X ~ x i | y i ∈ ω 0 ( ~ x i − ~ m X 0 ) ( ~ x i − ~ m X 0 ) T ( A . 17 ) ˜ S X 1 = X ~ x i | y i ∈ ω 1 ( ~ x i − ~ m X 1 ) ( ~ x i − ~ m X 1 ) T ( A . 18 ) In addition , the sum of the matrices in ( A . 17 ) – ( A . 18 ) is often known as the within - class scatter matrix ˜ S X W = ˜ S X 0 + ˜ S X 1 . Let us consider a certain unit projection vector ~ e ( where k ~ e k = 1 ) which is in charge of weighing the relative contribution of each feature in the LDA linear combination . Applying ~ e to data yields : ~ z i = ~ e · ~ x i = ~ e T ~ x i ∀ i = 1 , . . . , n ( A . 19 ) yields sample means and scatter values : m Z 0 = ~ e T ~ m X 0 ( A . 20 ) m Z 1 = ~ e T ~ m X 1 ( A . 21 ) ˜ s 2 Z 0 = ~ e T ˜ S X 0 ~ e ( A . 22 ) ˜ s 2 Z 1 = ~ e T ˜ S X 1 ~ e ( A . 23 ) ˜ s 2 Z W = ˜ s 2 Z 0 + ˜ s 2 Z 1 = ~ e T ˜ S X W ~ e ( A . 24 ) LDA’s objective consists in maximizing class separability , deﬁned as the diﬀerence between projected means m Z 0 , m Z 1 and divided by a measure of spread , in this case the square root of the aggregated within - class scatter value ˜ s Z W [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] : m Z 1 − m Z 0 ˜ s Z W ( A . 25 ) However , the numerator in ( A . 25 ) can become negative . For this reason , the problem of maximizing class separability should be formulated on the squared version of ( A . 25 ) : ( m Z 1 − m Z 0 ) 2 ˜ s 2 Z W = [ ~ e T ( ~ m X 1 − ~ m X 0 ) ] 2 ~ e T ˜ S X W ~ e ( A . 26 ) 154 A . Mathematical foundations It can be proved [ Rencher and Christensen , 2012 ] that the quotient in ( A . 26 ) is maximized by taking the projected vector ~ e as : ~ e = ˜ S − 1 X W ( ~ m X 1 − ~ m X 0 ) ( A . 27 ) LDA extension for multi - class problems Let us now consider having C ∈ N possible classes { ω c } Cc = 1 , where C > 2 . The binary LDA formulation – summarized in the optimization of target quotient ( A . 26 ) – can in this case be extended to the maximization of a generalized quotient λ : λ = ~ e T ˜ S X B ~ e ~ e T ˜ S X W ~ e ( A . 28 ) where [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] : • ˜ S X W is the within - class scatter matrix , which aggregates the C scatter matrices cal - culated for each class by separate : ˜ S X W = C X c = 1 X ~ x i | y i ∈ ω c ( ~ x i − ~ m X c ) ( ~ x i − ~ m X c ) T ( A . 29 ) • ˜ S X B is the between - class scatter matrix , deﬁned as follows : ˜ S X B = C X c = 1 n c ( ~ m X c − ~ m X ) ( ~ m X c − ~ m X ) T ( A . 30 ) • ~ m X c is the sample mean vector for the c - th class , formed by n c data instances : ~ m X c = 1 n c X ~ x i | y i ∈ ω c ~ x i ∀ c = 1 , . . . , C ( A . 31 ) • ~ m X is the overall sample mean across classes : ~ m X = 1 n X ~ x i ∈D ~ x i = 1 n C X c = 1 n c ~ m X c ( A . 32 ) Maximizing ( A . 28 ) is equivalent to solving the following generalized eigenvalue problem [ Rencher and Christensen , 2012 ] : (cid:16) ˜ S − 1 X W ˜ S X B − λI (cid:17) ~ e = 0 ( A . 33 ) On the other hand , the number d LDA of eigenvectors ~ e in ( A . 33 ) which correspond to a non - zero eigenvalue λ equals [ Rencher and Christensen , 2012 ] : d LDA = rank ˜ S X B = min { C − 1 , d } ( A . 34 ) In practice , for the vast majority of feature extraction problems addressed with LDA the primary limitation is d LDA = C − 1 . As a consequence , the dimensionality of the feature subspace resulting from LDA projection is equal to the number of classes under consider - ation minus one . 155 A . 2 . Clustering A . 2 Clustering This family of problems consist in ﬁnding non - predeﬁned homogeneous groupings of data , known as ‘clusters’ , in such a way that their internal similarity – i . e . the resemblance among those data elements within the same cluster – is maximized , whereas the external similarity – i . e . across diﬀerent clusters – is minimal . Given that explicit data categories or predeﬁned correspondences are not available during training , clustering constitutes an unsupervised learning procedure for the discovery of ‘natural’ similarity structures in the dataset . In this PhD thesis , clustering approaches were used as a ‘smart preprocessing’ technique , or ‘smart feature extraction’ stage [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] , to quantize high - dimensional vector data onto a discrete set of options ( clusters ) . A . 2 . 1 K - means clustering K - means is the most extensively used clustering technique , at least in part due to its relative simplicity , both conceptual and computational . Given the dataset D = n ~ x i ∈ X ⊂ R d o n i = 1 , its aim is to partition D in a total of K ∈ N clusters , where the number K is assumed to be known beforehand . The proposed partition is fully speciﬁed by a set of cluster centroids n ~ c k ∈ R d o K k = 1 in such a manner that a certain input data instance ~ x is assigned to cluster C k ( with centroid at ~ c k ) if and only if it is closer to ~ c k than to any other centroid , i . e . : ~ x ∈ C k ⇔ k = arg min j = 1 , . . . , K dist ( ~ x , ~ c j ) ( A . 35 ) where dist ( · , · ) is a suitable distance metric in the input space R d . Typically , the squared Euclidean distance k ~ x − ~ c j k 2 is used , although other possible choices exist , e . g . city block , or Hamming distances . as a consequence , training the model Θ consists in ﬁnding the set of centroids Θ = { ~ c k } Kk = 1 which are best adapted to the spatial distribution of input data distribution , where opti - mality is understood in the sense of minimizing the following cost function J ( Θ ) : J ( Θ ) = K X k = 1 X ~ x ∈C k k ~ x − ~ c k k 2 ( A . 36 ) where in this case J ( Θ ) accounts for the sum of squared Euclidean distances from each data point ~ x to the centroid ~ c k of the particular cluster C k to which it is associated . In practise , J ( Θ ) is minimized iteratively . First , cluster centroids are initialized at random locations . Afterwards , each data item is associated to the cluster whose temporary centroid is nearest ( Figure A . 2 ) . Subsequently , each centroid location ~ c k is updated to the average position of data corresponding to C k ; hence its name of centroid , as a center of mass . This iterative process continues until displacements of centroids with respect to their former position at the previous iteration do no longer occur . However , this is an heuristic proce - dure which cannot guarantee an optimal solution , i . e . a global minimum for J ( Θ ) ; since it may converge to local minima . In particular , the process is specially sensitive to the initial centroid locations . To address this issue , a common is approach consists in selecting random points from D . In addition , and given that the iterative training is generally not very heavy from a computational perspective – especially if K is low – , the procedure may be repeated several times with diﬀerent random initializations , ﬁnally choosing the solution with lowest cost J ( Θ ) . 156 A . Mathematical foundations Figure A . 2 : Example depiction of the iterative training procedure for K - means , with K = 3 clusters . Panel a shows unassigned data instances – yellow diamonds – ; whereas panel b reﬂects a random initialization of cluster centroids – red , blue and green circles – for training . Panel c depicts the ﬁrst cluster associations , according to the initial locations of tentative centroids . Panels d to f illustrate the iterative update of centroids and cluster assignments until a ﬁnal solution is reached in f . In panel e , dotted circles mark those data instances whose cluster associations changed with respect to the previous iteration . Of note , the number of clusters K is an essential model parameter which must always be speciﬁed in order to proceed with the training of the algorithm . The choice for K is often done manually , at the sight of the cloud of input data points in D or inspecting the outputs for various tentative values for K . However , it is infrequent to reach to a clear , undisputed answer about what the optimal value for K should be . Therefore , parameter tuning procedures for setting K are often required . On the other hand and as outlined above , K - means has the disadvantage of being sensitive to the initialization of cluster centroids , an aspect which may cause a convergence to local optima . Finally , it is also vulnerable to outliers . A . 2 . 2 Gaussian Mixture Models Mixture models Let us assume that the n available data instances (cid:22)x ∈ D are drawn from K diﬀerent clusters { C k } Kk = 1 ; where both K and prior cluster probabilities P ( C k ) are known – at least for the moment – , but the actual cluster correspondences for each data item are ignored . Let us also consider that the general form of the conditional probability densities is : p ( X = (cid:22)x | C k ; θ k ) ∀ k = 1 , . . . , K ( A . 37 ) where θ k represents the unknown collection parameters which fully determine the speciﬁc conditional probability density function for the k - th cluster C k . In these general mixture models , the process to draw data instances (cid:22)x ∈ D occurs in two consecutive stages : 1 . Randomly selecting a certain cluster C k , with prior probability P ( C k ) 157 A . 2 . Clustering 2 . Generating ~ x in accordance to the speciﬁc conditional density function p ( X = ~ x | C k ; θ k ) of cluster C k in ( A . 37 ) . Hence , the overall probability density function for data would be : p ( X = ~ x | Θ ) = K X k = 1 p ( X = ~ x | C k ; θ k ) P ( C k ) ( A . 38 ) formed by the K components , each weighted by its corresponding prior ; and being Θ = { θ k } Kk = 1 the yet unknown collection of parameters for the aggregated mixture model . Therefore , the dataset D = n ~ x i ∈ X ⊂ R d o n i = 1 must be used in order to generate a suitable a posteriori estimate ˆΘ of model parameters , ideally to match the original Θ from which data instances were drawn . This estimation is normally performed through maximum - likelihood procedures , which aime to maximize the likelihood of the observed samples given tentative model parameters : ˆΘ = arg max Θ { p ( D | Θ ) } = arg max Θ ( n Y i = 1 p ( X = ~ x i | Θ ) ) ( A . 39 ) In general , ( A . 39 ) encompasses very complex search problems in high - dimensional spaces , which are solved by iterative numerical algorithms including expectation - maximization ( EM ) approaches [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] . If priors P ( C k ) are also unknown – as it is often the case – , maximum - likelihood estimates for ˆ P ( C k ) can also be employed . Once a suitable estimate ˆΘ has been calculated , the mixture can be decomposed into its primary components , a decomposition which allows to ascertain the cluster associations ˆ C ( i ) for each data item ~ x i . This task is carried out with a maximum a posteriori procedure ( Bayes theorem ) on the derived densities : ˆ C ( i ) = arg max k = 1 , . . . , K n p (cid:16) X = ~ x i | C k ; ˆ θ k (cid:17) ˆ P ( C k ) o ( A . 40 ) Gaussian mixtures Gaussian Mixture Models ( GMM ) constitute a particularization of the more general case formulated above in which each cluster - speciﬁc density function in ( A . 37 ) is modelled as a multivariate normal distribution – i . e . Gaussian – with mean vector ~ µ k ∈ R d and covariance matrix Σ k ∈ R d × d [ Reynolds , 1995 ] : p ( X = ~ x | C k ; θ k ) = 1 ( 2 π ) d 2 | Σ k | 12 e − 12 ( ~ x − ~ µ k ) T Σ − 1 k ( ~ x − ~ µ k ) ( A . 41 ) Aiming to simplify and accelerate the EM learning of GMM parameters , extra assumptions are sometimes made about the form of the covariance matrices Σ , restricting their number of free parameters : e . g . by assuming Σ to be diagonal . However , such restrictions were not employed in this work . A . 2 . 3 Hierarchical clustering Hierarchical clustering methods propose an ordered sequence of cluster groupings or un - groupings which partition the dataset D = n ~ x i ∈ X ⊂ R d o n i = 1 . This sequence of partitions , which can be represented in a very practical and intuitive graphical manner by means 158 A . Mathematical foundations Figure A . 3 : Dendrogram representation of a hierarchical sequence of grouping ( for bottom - up approaches ) or ungrouping operations ( for top - down schemes ) among sub - clusters . De - pending on the number of clusters which are speciﬁed as the target ﬁnal outcome , the dendogram’s tree structure should be ‘cut’ at a certain depth or another . of a dendrogram ( Figure A . 3 ) , may progress from n clusters – all singletons – towards an unique cluster containing all n samples , or vice versa . In a bottom - up ( i . e . agglomerative ) approach , the algorithm starts from the n singletons and proceeds by iteratively merging those two clusters C i , C j which are nearest to each other than any other possible pair . On the contrary , top - down ( i . e . divisive ) strategies commence with one universal cluster con - taining all n instances and progress by ﬁnding the two maximally separated sub - clusters , splitting them and proceeding recursively . As for other methodologies ( e . g . K - means ) , hierarchical clustering requires a desired num - ber of clusters to be established . In addition , two types of distance metrics need to be speciﬁed as well , namely : 1 . Distance between two individual data instances or points (cid:22)x , (cid:22)x (cid:31) ; being Euclidean distance the most frequent option : dist ( (cid:22)x , (cid:22)x (cid:31) ) Eucl = (cid:27) (cid:22)x − (cid:22)x (cid:31) (cid:27) = (cid:30)(cid:29)(cid:29)(cid:29)(cid:28) d (cid:27) j = 1 ( x j − x (cid:31) j ) 2 ( A . 42 ) although various other suitable metrics exist : e . g . Mahalanobis distance , city - block , Minkowski or Hamming metrics . 2 . Distance l between two clusters , also known as ‘linkage’ criterion . Common choices for this ‘linkage’ function are : • minimal – or ‘single’ – criterion , deﬁned as the distance between the nearest pair of points , one in each cluster : l min ( C i , C j ) = min (cid:16)x ∈C i , (cid:16)x (cid:31) ∈C j dist ( (cid:22)x , (cid:22)x (cid:31) ) ( A . 43 ) • maximal – or ‘complete’ – criterion , i . e . the distance between the two furthest points belonging to each cluster : l max ( C i , C j ) = max (cid:16)x ∈C i , (cid:16)x (cid:31) ∈C j dist ( (cid:22)x , (cid:22)x (cid:31) ) ( A . 44 ) • average criterion , where the mean of all possible pairs is computed : l avg ( C i , C j ) = 1 n i n j (cid:27) (cid:16)x ∈C i (cid:27) (cid:16)x (cid:31) ∈C j dist ( (cid:22)x , (cid:22)x (cid:31) ) ( A . 45 ) being n i , n j the number items ( i . e . the cardinality ) for clusters C i and C j , respectively . 159 A . 2 . Clustering • centroid criterion , deﬁned as the distance between the geometric centres of mass for each of the two clusters under consideration : l centr ( C i , C j ) = dist ( ~ m i , ~ m j ) ( A . 46 ) ~ m i = 1 n i X ~ x ∈C i ~ x ( A . 47 ) ~ m j = 1 n j X ~ x ′ ∈C j ~ x ′ ( A . 48 ) • Ward’s distance criterion , calculated as the incremental sum of square errors ( SSE ) [ Ward , 1963 ] : l Ward ( C i , C j ) = SSE C i , C j − (cid:16) SSE C i + SSE C j (cid:17) ( A . 49 ) where : SSE C i = n i X i = 1 dist 2 ( ~ x i , ~ m i ) ( A . 50 ) SSE C j = n j X j = 1 dist 2 (cid:16) ~ x ′ j , ~ m j (cid:17) ( A . 51 ) SSE C i , C j = n i X i = 1 dist 2 ( ~ x i , ~ m ij ) + n j X j = 1 dist 2 (cid:16) ~ x ′ j , ~ m ij (cid:17) ( A . 52 ) ~ m ij = n i ~ m i + n j ~ m j n i + n j ( A . 53 ) A . 2 . 4 Self Organizing Maps Self Organizing Maps ( SOM ) are a form of artiﬁcial neural networks ﬁrst introduced by [ Kohonen , 1990 ] . They were conceived to produce a low - dimensional representation – typically a 2D grid map – which discretises the high - dimensional input data space . Their training phases consists in adjusting neurons’ weights vectors , which determine prox - imity with respect to data instances . After weights ~ w ∈ R d have been randomly initialized , an iterative procedure is started . At the t - th iteration , training proceeds by picking a certain input vector ~ x from the dataset D = n ~ x i ∈ X ⊂ R d o n i = 1 in order to calculate which neuron y ⋆ has its weight ~ w y ⋆ most similar to ~ x : y ⋆ = arg min y k ~ x − ~ w y k ( A . 54 ) This neuron y ⋆ is declared ‘winner’ ( in a so - called ‘competitive’ learning ) , and its weight ~ w y ⋆ updated to be pulled a fraction η closer to input ~ x . Along with neuron y ⋆ , its closest neighbours in the topology of the neural network ( Figure A . 4 ) also undergo the following update of their respective neuron weights for next iteration t + 1 : ~ w y [ t + 1 ] = ~ w y [ t ] + η [ t ] Λ ( | y − y ⋆ | ) { ~ x − ~ w y [ t ] } ( A . 55 ) where the learning rate η [ t ] ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) decreases slowly with iterations ; as it also does the radius of action of Λ ( · ) , the neighbourhood function . Typical neuron topologies for SOM are hexagonal lattices ( Figure A . 5 ) and square grids . 160 A . Mathematical foundations Figure A . 4 : SOM neighbourhood function Λ ( · ) . Figure A . 5 : Example depicting various iterations of the SOM training algorithm . Panel a shows the initial distribution of neurons in an hexagonal 2D lattice . In panel b , an input data instance (cid:22)x ( red diamond ) is taken , which activates primarily the winning neuron ( red circle ) and , to a lesser extent , also its neighbours ( orange and yellow circles ) . Those neurons undergo an update of their weights towards (cid:22)x in panel c . Panels d to h illustrate additional iterations of training . The biological inspiration of this type of artiﬁcial neural networks resides in that neurons which are topologically near within the network structure , will have similar functionality and responses for a certain input . In this regard , once training is complete ( which tends to demand a large number of iterations ) , the network will have learnt the distribution patterns in data , in such a way that adjacent neurons will respond similarly ; whereas dissimilar inputs will activate distant regions of the SOM map . In other words , input data items which are close to each other in the original , high - dimensional feature space are in turn related to neighbouring neurons in the SOM representation . Hence , the SOM produces a low - dimensional – typically 2D – mapping , in which distances and proximity relationships are preserved as much as possible . In this manner , SOMs achieve a discrete approximation to the underlying probability density function of data , especially if the number of neurons is high . If fewer neurons , SOMs cluster the input space [ Kohonen , 1990 ; Kaski , 1997 ] . 161 A . 3 . Classiﬁcation A . 3 Classiﬁcation Classiﬁcation problems in ML can be formalized as the process to ﬁnd a suitable function matching data inputs with their corresponding ground truth class assignments , which are provided for reference during the training stage . Thus , classiﬁcation belong to supervised learning , as opposed to clustering schemes in which a desired output is not explicitly known a priori . Ideally , a classiﬁer should have high accuracy ( i . e . low output error ) , as well as good generalizability , which means that its performance remains in satisfactory levels for new inputs which were not seen during the training stage . On the other hand , the number of classes under consideration must be ﬁnite . A . 3 . 1 Naïve Bayes Given a dataset D = n ( ~ x i , y i ) | ~ x i ∈ X ⊂ R d , y i ∈ Y = { 1 , . . . , C } ⊂ N o n i = 1 which contains n input data samples ~ x i , along with their ground truth correspondences y i to one out of the C possible classes . If the underlying model Θ was fully known , the output classiﬁcation assignment ˆ y for a certain input item ~ x would be obtained by means of its maximum a posteriori probability : ˆ y = arg max c = 1 , . . . , C { p ( Y = c | X = ~ x ; Θ ) } ( A . 56 ) where in accordance to Bayes rule , the posterior probability in ( A . 56 ) can be expressed as follows : p ( Y = c | X = ~ x ; Θ ) = p ( X = ~ x | Y = c ; Θ ) P ( Y = c ) P Cc = 1 p ( X = ~ x | Y = c ; Θ ) P ( Y = c ) ( A . 57 ) ∝ p ( X = ~ x | Y = c ; Θ ) P ( Y = c ) ( A . 58 ) Given D , the estimation of priors P ( Y = c ) in ( A . 58 ) is straightforward ; whereas likelihoods p ( X = ~ x | Y = c ; Θ ) may in general be considerably diﬃcult to model and to identify . For this reason , the Naïve Bayes ( NB ) approach assumes these likelihoods to be class - conditionally independent for each feature with respect to all other dimensions , i . e . [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] : p ( X = ~ x | Y = c ; Θ ) ∼ d Y j = 1 p ( X ( j ) = x j | Y = c ; Θ ) ( A . 59 ) This premise entails that the problem of estimating a complicated multivariate probability density function ( pdf ) in R d can instead be reduced in NB schemes to estimate d simpler univariate pdfs . Besides , for continuous variables it is common to model these univariate pdfs as Gaussians ∼ N ( µ , σ ) . Accepting this NB assumption in ( A . 59 ) , and once the general form of pdfs has been established – e . g . as Gaussians – , training the NB classiﬁer consists in estimating suitable parameter values ˆΘ to specify univariate pdfs fully ; e . g . in the case of Gasussians : means ˆ µ j , c and standard deviations ˆ σ j , c , along with priors ˆ P ( c ) . This task is usually carried out via maximum likelihood estimations [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] . A . 3 . 2 Multinomial logistic regression Given dataset D , logistic regression is founded on the estimation of posterior probabilities for each of the C classes by means of linear regression formulae . In particular , the natural 162 A . Mathematical foundations logarithms of the ratios between the posteriors of the c - th and the C - th ( i . e . last ) classes are computed . Mathematically : log " p ( Y = c | X = ~ x ; Θ ) p ( Y = C | X = ~ x ; Θ ) # = β 0 , c + ~ β c · ~ x = β 0 , c + ~ β T c ~ x ∀ c = 1 , . . . , C − 1 ( A . 60 ) where scalar β 0 , c is a bias or intercept term and vector ~ β c ∈ R d represents the set of weights for each of the d features in ~ x . From ( A . 60 ) it can be easily derived that : p ( Y = c | X = ~ x ; Θ ) = p ( Y = C | X = ~ x ; Θ ) e β 0 , c + ~ β Tc ~ x ( A . 61 ) Given that the posteriors must sum to 1 , from ( A . 61 ) it follows : p ( Y = c | X = ~ x ; Θ ) = e β 0 , c + ~ β Tc ~ x 1 + P C − 1 c = 1 e β 0 , c + ~ β Tc ~ x ∀ c = 1 , . . . , C − 1 ( A . 62 ) p ( Y = C | X = ~ x ; Θ ) = 1 − C − 1 X c = 1 p ( Y = c | X = ~ x ; Θ ) = 1 1 + P C − 1 c = 1 e β 0 , c + ~ β Tc ~ x ( A . 63 ) Parameters β 0 , c and ~ β c ∈ R d for each class ( except the C - th one ) are estimated iteratively via maximum likelihood schemes . Once the logistic regression model is trained , classiﬁca - tion is carried out simply by choosing the maximum a posteriori probability . A . 3 . 3 Multi - Layer Perceptrons Feed - forward multi - layer perceptrons ( MLPs ) are a family of artiﬁcial neural networks in which neurons are arranged in layers , almost always with full interconnection between adjacent layers ( Figure A . 6 ) and non - linear neuron activation responses . MLPs can be used for both ML classiﬁcation and estimation problems , a ﬂexibility which has made them the most frequent neural network architecture across a wide variety of ﬁelds of application . Mathematically , the behaviour of a neuron with m inputs { u j } mj = 1 and a single output v can be described as follows : v = f   w 0 + m X j = 1 w j u j   = f ( w 0 + ~ w T ~ u ) ( A . 64 ) The linear combination of inputs u j , weighted by factors w j – plus a bias weight w 0 – , is fed to a non - linear response function f ( · ) ( Figure A . 6 , panel a ) , where common choices for f are sigmoid curves , e . g . : f ( u ) = tanh u ( A . 65 ) f ( u ) = 1 1 + e − u ( A . 66 ) The classical MLP network architecture is depicted in Figure A . 6 ( panel b ) : input and output layers plus one additional ‘hidden’ layer interspersed between both . The input layer is in charge of transporting data to the neurons in the hidden layer , which in turn activate according to ( A . 64 ) . Outcomes from these hidden neurons are then supplied as successive input for the neurons in the output layer . Connections between pairs of neurons are characterized by their weights , which – along with biases – fully specify the response of 163 A . 3 . Classiﬁcation Figure A . 6 : MLP architecture . Panel a ( left ) illustrates the internal functioning of a single neuron , connected by its inputs to m other neurons and characterized by a non - linear activation . Panel b ( right ) shows the layered arrangement and interconnection of neurons in the network . the MLP model . Hence , being Θ the collection of weights and biases across the network , the MLP implements a non - linear mapping function g Θ ( · ) : (cid:22)y = g Θ ( (cid:22)x ) ( A . 67 ) Despite its relatively simple modular formulation , g Θ ( · ) encompasses high expressive power . In this regard , Kolmogorov proved [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] that , with a suﬃciently high number of hidden neurons , appropriate weights and suitable non - linearity functions f , any contin - uous function g ( · ) can be implemented through a MLP with an unique hidden layer . Given the dataset D = (cid:26) ( (cid:22)x i , y i ) | (cid:22)x i ∈ X ⊂ R d , y i ∈ Y = { 1 , . . . , C } ⊂ N (cid:25) n i = 1 with input data (cid:22)x i and ground truth class assignments y i , a MLP classiﬁer devised to be applied in this problem must have the following structure [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] : a ) as many neurons in the input layer as dimensions d in data ; and b ) as many neurons in the output layer as the number C of classes under consideration . In this regard , for the purpose of training the MLP , desired outputs (cid:22)y ∈ R C in ( A . 67 ) must be binary vectors reﬂecting ground truth class assignments y i , in such a manner that the c - th vector coordinate of (cid:22)y equals 1 if and only if y i = c ; and 0 otherwise . The process of training the MLP consists in ﬁnding a suitable set ˆ Θ of connection weights w j and biases w 0 for all neurons in the network . The appropriateness of a certain combination of model parameters ˆΘ is determined by its ability to minimize a certain cost function J : ˆΘ = arg min Θ J ( Θ ) ( A . 68 ) where J ( Θ ) accumulates penalizations in the form of squared diﬀerences between the ideally desired output vectors (cid:22)y i and the actual results obtained by the non - linear mapping g Θ ( · ) , i . e . : J ( Θ ) = 1 2 n (cid:27) i = 1 (cid:27) (cid:22)y i − g Θ ( (cid:22)x i ) (cid:27) 2 ( A . 69 ) Once the MLP network is trained , classiﬁcation outcomes are achieved by determining which of its C output neurons becomes maximally activated when presenting a certain new input to the network . However , given the high number of parameters ( weights , biases ) which 164 A . Mathematical foundations must be tuned to minimize ( A . 69 ) , training constitutes an arduous non - convex optimization problem in a high - dimensional search space , for which a globally optimal solution cannot be guaranteed . For this reason , various numerical optimization algorithms based on gradient descent approximations can be applied to the training of MLPs , the most popular being known as ‘back - propagation’ , for which a series of practical considerations apply [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] . In particular , regarding the number of neurons in the hidden layer : the user should either specify it manually , rely on ‘rules of thumb’ or use automatic parameter tuning procedures . A . 3 . 4 Support Vector Machines support vector machines ( SVMs ) are maximal - margin classiﬁers . Although originally con - ceived for binary problems , SVMs can also be applied to multi - class classiﬁcation tasks with relatively simple extensions . Binary problem with linear class separability Let us consider a binary ( two - class ) dataset D = n ( ~ x i , y i ) | ~ x i ∈ X ⊂ R d , y i ∈ Y = { ± 1 } o n i = 1 which satisﬁes the property of linear separability between both classes . In this case , there are inﬁnitely many valid linear boundaries which achieve perfect classiﬁcation ( Figure A . 7 ) . Those decision boundaries can be expressed mathematically as a hyperplanes in R d , charac - terized by their normal vector ~ w ∈ R d and a scalar oﬀset b . According to this formulation , the outcome decision ˆ y regarding the classiﬁcation of a data point ~ x would correspond to the application of the following expression : ˆ y = sign ( ~ w · ~ x + b ) ( A . 70 ) Taking into account ( A . 70 ) , let us deﬁne the ‘functional margin’ γ i of certain pair { ~ x i , y i } as a magnitude measuring its separation with respect to the decision boundary hyperplane : γ i = y i ( ~ w · ~ x + b ) ( A . 71 ) where this functional margin satisﬁes γ i > 0 for all pairs in D if the hyperplane under study is a valid boundary solution achieving perfect separation of classes . Consequently , γ i may become an useful indicator of the conﬁdence in the classiﬁcation provided by the separation hyperplane , because it reﬂects – up to a scale factor – the geometric distance from ~ x i to the decision boundary . In addition , it is interesting to have large margins as a protection against eventual noisy data instances . For this reason and aiming to enhance robustness in classiﬁcation , the SVM framework focuses on proposing a methodology to ﬁnd the appropriate separation hyperplane which maximizes margins . Considering the most limiting case – i . e . taking the minimal γ i value from the dataset – , a lower bound for all functional margins can be set : γ = min i = 1 , . . . , n γ i ⇒ y i ( ~ w · ~ x i + b ) ≥ γ ∀ i = 1 , . . . , n ( A . 72 ) It can be proved [ Vapnik , 1998 ] that the ‘geometrical margin’ ( which constitutes the ul - timate optimization goal for SVMs ) is related to the ‘functional margin’ , equalling 2 γ k ~ w k . Furthermore , in order to address a scale - invariant problem ( i . e . not sensitive to the rescal - ing of parameters ) , it can be assumed without loss of generality that γ = 1 [ Vapnik , 1998 ] . 165 A . 3 . Classiﬁcation Hence , the former margin - maximization problem can be restated as a minimization in the following terms : min ~ w , b 1 2 k ~ w k 2 | y i ( ~ w · ~ x i + b ) ≥ 1 ∀ i = 1 , . . . , n ( A . 73 ) where the right - hand side of ( A . 73 ) restricts the search of possible pairs { ~ w , b } to only those hyperplanes which produce valid decision boundaries that separate classes in a correct manner . On the other hand , and given that the optimization problem contained in ( A . 73 ) is convex [ Fradkin and Muchnik , 2000 ] , it can be solved eﬃciently by quadratic programming algorithms . Problems not satisfying linear class separability Datasets D satisfying the property of perfect linear class separability are extremely rare in practice . Nonetheless , the SVM formalism presented above can still be employed , provided that the user is willing to accept certain errors ξ i ( Figure A . 8 ) . In such case , in order to accommodate tolerated errors ξ i ∈ [ 0 , 1 ) , constraints in the right - hand side of ( A . 73 ) should be substituted by : y i ( ~ w · ~ x i + b ) ≥ 1 − ξ i ∀ i = 1 , . . . , n ( A . 74 ) and the optimization goal in its left hand side should now become : min ~ w , b 1 2 k ~ w k 2 + C box n X i = 1 ξ i ( A . 75 ) where C box – a regularization term , commonly known as ‘box constraint’ – is a positive scalar value which encompasses a trade - oﬀ between the tolerance of errors and the prevention of overﬁtting . This situation is often referred to as ‘soft margin’ SVM classiﬁcation ; whereas on the contrary , if C box → ∞ , then classiﬁcation errors become heavily penalized ( ‘hard margin’ ) and ( A . 75 ) tends to ( A . 73 ) . Dual ( Lagrangian ) SVM formulation Lagrange multipliers can be used to accommodate the constraints from the right - hand side of ( A . 73 ) , reformulating the former optimization problem as the minimization of the following target function L ( ~ w , b , α ) : L ( ~ w , b , α ) = 1 2 ~ w · ~ w − n X i = 1 α i [ y i ( ~ w · ~ x i + b ) − 1 ] ( A . 76 ) where Lagrange multipliers α satisfy : ( α i = 0 if y i ( ~ w · ~ x i + b ) > 1 ; constraint is irrelevant α i > 0 if y i ( ~ w · ~ x i + b ) = 1 ; constraint becomes relevant ( i . e . ~ x i is a ‘supporting vector’ ) ( A . 77 ) It can be proved [ Vapnik , 1998 ] that minimizing ( A . 76 ) subject to ( A . 77 ) is equivalent to solving problem ( A . 73 ) . Once ( A . 76 ) – ( A . 77 ) are solved , normal vector ~ w plus oﬀset b , which characterize the optimal SVM decision boundary hyperplane , can be derived as follows : ( ~ w = P ni = 1 α i y i ~ x i b = y k − ~ w · ~ x k for any k | α k 6 = 0 ( A . 78 ) 166 A . Mathematical foundations Figure A . 7 : SVM deﬁnition as a maximal - margin classiﬁer . For linearly separable problems , there are inﬁnitely many valid boundary planes ( black lines ) which separate correctly data belonging to each class . SVMs focus on the particular solution plane ( green line ) which comes not closer to either class than strictly necessary , thus optimizing the distance – i . e . margin – to data items . The most limiting cases ( emphasized by pink circles ) are known as ‘supporting vectors’ , hence the name of the methodology . Figure A . 8 : SVM boundary hyperplane for a dataset without perfect linear separability . By introducing ξ i terms , a fraction of erroneously classiﬁed samples are allowed . Figure A . 9 : Non - linear SVM decision boundaries generated via the application of ‘kernel tricks’ , achieving either perfect separation ( left panel ) or not ( right ) . Furthermore , incorporating ( A . 78 ) into ( A . 76 ) and applying Karush - Kuhn - Tucker condi - tions [ Vapnik , 1998 ] , then ( A . 76 ) – ( A . 77 ) can be rewritten as the maximization of : n (cid:27) i = 1 α i − 1 2 n (cid:27) i = 1 n (cid:27) j = 1 α i α j y i y j (cid:22)x i · (cid:22)x j | n (cid:27) i = 1 α i y i = 0 ; α i ≥ 0 ∀ i = 1 , . . . , n ( A . 79 ) which can be solved eﬃciently by quadratic programming algorithms . Finally , in order to address problems without perfect class separability , the ‘box’ constraint C box needs to be incorporated into the right - hand side of ( A . 79 ) in the following manner : C box ≥ α i ≥ 0 ∀ i = 1 , . . . , n ( A . 80 ) 167 A . 3 . Classiﬁcation Kernels Linear separation hyperplanes may not always result ﬂexible enough for realistic application scenarios in which decision boundaries with more complex shapes are required ( Figure A . 9 ) . Nevertheless , SVMs can still accommodate these cases by means of the application of the so - called ‘kernel trick’ , where the dot product of vectors ~ x i , ~ x j in ( A . 79 ) may be substituted by a suitable kernel function κ : κ ( ~ x i , ~ x j ) = φ ( ~ x i ) · φ ( ~ x j ) ( A . 81 ) This can be done even without the need for knowing the transformation φ ( · ) explicitly , since Mercer’s theorem states that positive semi - deﬁniteness is the necessary and suﬃcient condition for a symmetric function κ ( · , · ) to be a valid kernel [ Burges , 1998 ] . Common choices for κ include : • homogeneous polynomial kernels ( where p > 0 ) : κ ( ~ x i , ~ x j ) = ( ~ x i · ~ x j ) p ( A . 82 ) • inhomogeneous polynomial kernels ( where p , k 0 > 0 ) κ ( ~ x i , ~ x j ) = ( ~ x i · ~ x j + k 0 ) p ( A . 83 ) • Gaussian kernels , also known as radial basis functions ( RBF ) ( where σ 2 > 0 ) : κ ( ~ x i , ~ x j ) = exp " −k ~ x i − ~ x j k 2 2 σ 2 # ( A . 84 ) • hyperbolic tangent kernels ( where η > 0 , ν < 0 ) : κ ( ~ x i , ~ x j ) = tanh ( η ~ x i · ~ x j + ν ) ( A . 85 ) Despite not having the explicit deﬁnition of φ ( · ) for these kernels , a new input ~ x ′ can still be processed by the SVM , generating an outcome classiﬁcation ˆ y ′ ∈ { ± 1 } according to the following formula : ˆ y ′ = sign ( ~ w · φ ( ~ x ′ ) + b ) ( A . 86 ) where : ( ~ w · φ ( ~ x ′ ) = P ni = 1 α i y i κ ( ~ x ′ , ~ x i ) b = y k − P ni = 1 α i y i κ ( ~ x k , ~ x i ) for any k | C box > α k > 0 ( A . 87 ) Multi - class SVM extension If instead of a binary classiﬁcation problem , C possible classes are considered ( where C > 2 ∈ N ) ; then the procedure requires adaptations with respect to the standard binary SVM algorithms detailed above . The most common strategy ( and adopted in this PhD work ) is known as the one - versus - all ( OVA ) approach . OVA consists in producing C diﬀerent SVM classiﬁers , each of which must be trained to distinguish one class from all of the remaining others aggregated together . Another possibility , named one - versus - one , leads to the training of a SVM for each one of the (cid:16) C 2 (cid:17) = C ( C − 1 ) 2 possible pairs of classes . Practical aspects When using SVMs in practical applications , various essential conﬁguration options – i . e . ‘hyperparameters’ in ML terminology – need to be selected , constituting a challenging sit - uation which can greatly inﬂuence the resulting overall performance of the SVM model . 168 A . Mathematical foundations In ﬁrst place : the type of kernel to be employed , where linear and RBF are the two most common choices in literature . In addition , an appropriate value for the regularization parameter C box must be established . If C box is set too small , then errors may not be suﬃ - ciently penalized ; leading in turn to an oversimpliﬁed SVM classiﬁer with the subsequent risk of underﬁtting ( i . e . high bias problem ) . Conversely , if C box is assigned a too high value , errors may gain excessive attention , leading to a SVM model overﬁtting the data used during training ( high variance problem ) and hence losing generalization power . Fur - thermore , in the case of RBF kernels , a similar eﬀect may occur with magnitude σ 2 , i . e . kernel width : large σ 2 values may induce oversimpliﬁed models ( high bias ) ; whereas too low σ 2 choices could pose a risk of overﬁtting ( high variance ) . As a consequence , automatic parameter tuning procedures are often the preferred manner of selecting appropriate SVM hyperparameter values . A . 3 . 5 Decision trees Decision trees represent , in a very natural and interpretable manner , a structured sequence of tests ( ‘queries’ ) concerning data properties . Depending on the result of the speciﬁc query at a certain point ( known as ‘node’ ) , the decision ﬂow progresses through a separate path ( ‘branch’ ) . This process terminates and produces an outcome – in this case , a classiﬁcation assignment – whenever it reaches a node in which further queries are not speciﬁed ( ‘leaf’ ) . Therefore , the process of training a decision tree consists in determining a suitable sequence of queries in a structured manner . A considerable variety of tree algorithms exist , although this section overviews the system known as classiﬁcation and regression trees ( CART ) , which is a ﬂexible , general - purpose framework that covers the main principles of almost all of the algorithms devised for the automatic creation of decision trees . Given a dataset D for training , where D contains data items and their corresponding ground truth class assignments , tree building algorithms in general progress recursively to generate queries which split D into smaller and more homogeneous subsets . Of note , this procedure is said to be non - metric because the splitting is not based on distance criteria between samples . Tree splitting At each node , its query’s outcome routes the progress of the decision ﬂow through a certain branch in the tree . Consequently , the branching factor B – determined by the number of possible outcomes for the query – depends on the type of data being inspected and on how the query is deﬁned . In general terms , a node can derive into more than two child branches ( i . e . B > 2 ) , although those situations can be made equivalent to a succession of binary decisions ( B = 2 ) . For this reason , explanations here are primarily – although not exclusively – oriented to binary trees . The strategy to search how to split the tree at a node is a design choice , but following the principle of parsimony , simple and compact trees with fewer nodes tend to preferred ; for which a greedy heuristic is commonly used . At a certain node N , this greedy heuristic consists in seeking for a query / test τ which makes the data samples which reach the im - mediate descendent nodes as ‘pure’ as possible . Let i ( N ) be a metric of data ‘impurity’ at the current node N , the aim is to ﬁnd a test τ which maximizes the change in impurity ∆ i , reﬂecting an increase in purity : ∆ i ( N ; τ ) = i ( N ) − [ P Pos , τ i ( N Pos , τ ) + P Neg , τ i ( N Neg , τ ) ] ( A . 88 ) 169 A . 3 . Classiﬁcation where P Pos , τ , P Neg , τ are the fractions of data patterns at node N which give respectively positive and negative answers to the test τ . Besides , N Pos , τ , N Neg , τ are the immediate positive / negative descendent nodes following query τ at N . Therefore , the greedy heuristic performs a local optimization , because it evaluates the immediate progression of the tree , at a single node and only one depth level further . This aspect entails an advantage in terms of restraining the algorithm’s complexity and computational load ; although at the expense of preventing the guarantee of achieving globally optimal decision structures . On the other hand , when B > 2 ( ‘multi - ways splits’ ) the straightforward extension of ( A . 88 ) would be : ∆ i ( N ; τ ) = i ( N ) − B X b = 1 P b , τ i ( N b , τ ) ( A . 89 ) However , this deﬁnition in ( A . 89 ) is known to favour in excess decisions with large branching factors B . For this reason , a ‘gain impurity ratio’ is often preferred as target : ∆ i B ( N ; τ ) = i ( N ) − P Bb = 1 P b , τ i ( N b , τ ) − P Bb = 1 P b , τ log 2 [ P b , τ ] ( A . 90 ) For the maximization of ∆ i ( N ; τ ) in ( A . 88 ) or ∆ i B ( N ; τ ) in ( A . 90 ) , the space T of candi - date tests τ needs to be explored as eﬃciently as possible . Consequently and in order to speed up the search , tests should ideally be quick to compute , which in practise is often achieved by tests consisting in the application of thresholds on a single feature . Another important aspect is how to quantify the ‘impurity’ i ( N ) at a certain node . Let us denote as ˆ P ( ω j ) or ˆ P ( ~ x ∈ ω j | N ) the fraction of patterns ~ x at node N which belong to the j - th ground truth class ω j . Frequent choices for the impurity function i ( N ) are [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] : • Entropy H : i H ( N ) = − X j ˆ P ( ω j ) log 2 h ˆ P ( ω j ) i ( A . 91 ) • Gini’s diversity index G : i G ( N ) = X j X k 6 = j ˆ P ( ω j ) ˆ P ( ω k ) = 1 2   1 − X j ˆ P 2 ( ω j )   ( A . 92 ) • Misclassiﬁcation rate M : i M ( N ) = 1 − max j ˆ P ( ω j ) ( A . 93 ) where i M ( N ) estimates the minimum probability for a training sample to be classiﬁed incorrectly at node N if treated as a leaf node . Theoretically , trees could be grown until the purity of the patterns which reach a particular leaf node is maximal ( e . g . all belong to the same ground truth class ) . However , this pro - cedure can be counter - productive in terms of the overall classiﬁcation accuracy attained , since it carries a notable risk of overﬁtting the tree to the training set ; hence losing gener - alization power for new patterns unseen during the training stage . To prevent this issue , two major alternative strategies exist , namely : a ) stop splitting , and b ) pruning . Stopped splitting Various criteria are available to ascertain suitable points to stop the splitting procedure . For example , the performance of the tree can be evaluated via cross - validation methods , 170 A . Mathematical foundations decreeing to stop its growth when the cross - validated performance worsens . The disad - vantage of such a methodology resides however in the notable computational loads which are involved . Another option would be to deﬁne a certain threshold value ∆ i Thr ( where ∆ i Thr > 0 , although small ) in such a way that if max N ′ ∆ i ( N ′ ) ≤ ∆ i Thr , then training is terminated . Yet another possible solution could be to test for the statistical signiﬁcance of the reductions in impurity [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] . Tree pruning It is widely acknowledged that the stopped splitting strategy described above tends to favour trees in which the highest reductions in impurity occur near the root node , a be - haviour which might however lead to premature stops [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] . As an alternative approach to stopped splitting , pruning commences by growing the tree completely : i . e . un - til its leaf nodes have the minimum possible impurity . Subsequently , all pairs of neighbour leaves – i . e . those leaf nodes linked to a common antecedent exactly one level above – are considered for elimination . Then , any pair whose elimination would yield a suﬃciently small increase in overall impurity is pruned : its pending nodes are merged together to the common antecedent , which is hence declared a leaf , and consequently new candidate for further pruning . Such a procedure continues recursively until the pruning of any pair of leaf nodes would lead to an unacceptably high increase in impurity . Pruning tends to produce better overall outcomes than stopped splitting schemes , and is therefore generally preferred in practise [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] . Other tree algorithms There are a number of diﬀerent tree algorithms in addition to CART , being ID3 and C4 . 5 arguably the most renowned schmes . The ID3 algorithm ( Interactive Dichotomizer 3 ) is restricted to work with nominal ( unordered , discrete ) input data , so if continuous real - valued attributes are involved , these need to be binned into discrete intervals beforehand . In turn , the C4 . 5 methods is a reﬁnement of ID3 which has reached notable popularity . In C4 . 5 , real - valued variables are treated as in CART ; whereas multi - ways splits ( B > 2 ) are allowed for nominal data , based on the impurity gain ratio in ( A . 90 ) . In addition , C4 . 5’s heuristic for pruning relies on analysing the statistical signiﬁcance of splits . A . 3 . 6 Meta - classiﬁcation : Bagging Bagging is an acronym which stands for ‘Bootstrap Aggregation’ . Bootstrap refers to a statistical resampling technique in which a dataset D with n items is randomly resampled n times with repetition to form a related training set D ′ ; where D ′ contains on average ( 1 − e − 1 ) ≃ 63 . 2 % unique samples [ Alpaydin , 2014 ] , being the rest duplicates . The term aggregation stems from the fact that in this methodology , ﬁnal decisions are obtained by majority voting – i . e . aggregation – of a number of component classiﬁers known as ‘weak learners’ ; where each of these components had been previously trained on a diﬀerent random dataset instance D ′ generated from D by bootstrapping . Consequently , these ‘weak learners’ are the fundamental constituent of Bagging , which eﬀectively relies on them to achieve classiﬁcation outcomes . For this reason , Bagging is referred to as a ‘meta - classiﬁcation’ scheme . Furthermore , for this aggregation strategy to be practical , the ensembled learners should be to some extent ‘weak’ , i . e . sensitive in such a manner that slight changes in the dataset D ′ from an iteration to another may lead to relatively pronounced diﬀerences in the structure of the ‘weak learner’ resulting from 171 A . 3 . Classiﬁcation the training process . This behaviour occurs for example in decision trees generated with a greedy splitting heuristic [ Duda et al . , 2000 ] . A . 3 . 7 Meta - classiﬁcation : Boosting Boosting algorithms are meta - classiﬁers which combine ‘weak learners’ in order to increase – i . e . to ‘boost’ – the overall performance attained by those learners when considered by separate , even if they are only slightly better than pure random guessing [ Freund and Schapire , 1997 ] . To do so , Boosting encompasses an iterative process in which learners are added to form a robust ensemble in which individual outcomes are weighted to produce a ﬁnal classiﬁcation . More speciﬁcally , relative weights depend on the performance shown by each learner during its training stage . For brevity reasons , this appendix focuses on the AdaBoost algorithm ( acronym which stands for ‘Adaptive Boosting’ ) , although several other Boosting variants exist , e . g . LP - Boost , TotalBoost , BrownBoost , MadaBoost or LogitBoost . AdaBoost Given dataset D = n ( ~ x i , y i ) | ~ x i ∈ X ⊂ R d , y i ∈ Y = { ± 1 } o n i = 1 for binary classiﬁcation and the space H of possible ‘weak’ binary learners h ( · ) : X 7→ Y ; let us assume that the number T of iterations over which to perform training is known . The AdaBoost scheme is named adaptive because it embraces a distribution of weights ~ w [ t ] ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] n ⊂ R n ( where P ni = 1 w i [ t ] = 1 ) which governs the relative importance of each input data instance . As training progresses , this set of weights becomes updated : w i [ t ] at the t - th iteration are adjusted depending on whether the temporary weak learner succeeded or failed in classifying the associated data sample ~ x i . Hence , adaptation occurs in the sense that previously misclassiﬁed inputs gain importance ( i . e . weight ) to allow for more focus during subsequent training iterations . In general terms , AdaBoost tends to achieve good generalization power , being less prone to overﬁtting than other schemes ; although it may be sensitive to noise and outliers . AdaBoost’s training algorithm can be described is as follows [ Freund and Schapire , 1997 ] : • Previously yo the ﬁrst iteration , weights vector ~ w [ t ] for t = 1 must be initialized in order to start with equally distributed importance weights for all data samples , i . e . : w i [ t = 1 ] = 1 n ∀ i = 1 , . . . , n ( A . 94 ) • Iterate for t = 1 , . . . , T , where T is the pre - established number of training cycles : – Across the space H of all possible weak learners , pick h [ t ] : X 7→ Y to minimize the overall classiﬁcation error in which current weights ~ w [ t ] for instances in D are taken into account . In case that a weight - based training is not feasible for the typology of weak learners in H , a practical solution would consist in obtaining a modiﬁed version D ′ [ t ] of the dataset , randomly drawn from D with selection probabilities in accordance to the distribution of weights ~ w [ t ] . – Calculate the weighted error rate ǫ [ t ] obtained by the candidate classiﬁer h [ t ] : ǫ [ t ] = n X i = 1 h [ t ] ( ~ x i ) 6 = y i w i [ t ] = n X i = 1 w i [ t ] | h [ t ] ( ~ x i ) − y i | 2 ( A . 95 ) 172 A . Mathematical foundations Without loss of generality , it can be assumed that ǫ [ t ] ≤ 12 : otherwise , the binary complementary of h [ t ] – i . e . a classiﬁer assigning the opposite outcome to h [ t ] for all inputs – would have performed better . – Calculate an auxiliary factor α [ t ] : α [ t ] = 1 2 log 1 − ǫ [ t ] ǫ [ t ] ! ( A . 96 ) where α [ t ] ≥ 0 since 0 ≤ ǫ [ t ] ≤ 12 . Given that α [ t ] increases as the error ǫ [ t ] decreases , α [ t ] can be used as a measure of conﬁdence regarding the current weak learner h [ t ] . – Update the distribution of weights for next iteration t + 1 : (cid:23) w i [ t + 1 ] = w i [ t ] Z [ t ] · ( e − α [ t ] if h [ t ] ( ~ x i ) = y i e + α [ t ] if h [ t ] ( ~ x i ) 6 = y i ( A . 97 ) = w i [ t ] Z [ t ] exp [ − α [ t ] y i h [ t ] ( ~ x i ) ] ( A . 98 ) where Z [ t ] is a mere normalization scalar which guarantees that weights continue to sum to one , i . e . P ni = 1 w i [ t + 1 ] = 1 . The update of weights from ( A . 97 ) – ( A . 98 ) is conceived in such a manner that those samples which were erroneously classiﬁed by h [ t ] , i . e . whenever h [ t ] ( ~ x i ) 6 = y i , get their weights increased by a factor e + α [ t ] Z [ t ] for iteration t + 1 ; whereas on the contrary , successfully classiﬁed data instances ( i . e . h [ t ] ( ~ x i ) = y i ) see their weights decreased in a similar proportion e − α [ t ] Z [ t ] . Thus , the new weak learner that will be trained at iteration t + 1 can adapt and focus on the most diﬃcult data items . • Once the iterative training detailed above is complete , the ﬁnal ‘robust’ classiﬁer H T : X 7→ Y is built as a weighted ensemble of the T ‘weak’ learners ; where the relative importance of each of these h [ t ] corresponds to its conﬁdence factor α [ t ] : H T ( ~ x ) = sign T X t = 1 α [ t ] h [ t ] ( ~ x ) ! ( A . 99 ) Since weighted error rates satisfy ǫ [ t ] ≤ 12 , magnitude γ [ t ] = 12 − ǫ [ t ] ≥ 0 reﬂects how much better h [ t ] is in comparison to pure random guessing , which in binary problems produces an average random error rate equal to 12 . It can be proved [ Freund and Schapire , 1997 ] that the total error rate ǫ , obtained by the ﬁnal robust classiﬁer H T ( · ) when applied on training data , has an upper bound as follows : ǫ ≤ T Y t = 1 2 q ǫ [ t ] ( 1 − ǫ [ t ] ) = T Y t = 1 q 1 − 4 γ 2 [ t ] ≤ exp ( − 2 T X t = 1 γ 2 [ t ] ) ( A . 100 ) Hence , if each and all of the T weak learners are at least slightly better than random : 0 ≤ ǫ [ t ] < 1 2 ∀ t = 1 , . . . , T ⇒ ∃ γ > 0 | γ [ t ] ≥ γ ∀ t = 1 , . . . , T ( A . 101 ) In consequence , the upper bound for ǫ as stated in ( A . 100 ) can be substituted by another upper bound ( more relaxed than ( A . 100 ) , although anyhow still valid ) : ǫ ≤ e − 2 T γ 2 ( A . 102 ) 173 A . 3 . Classiﬁcation Therefore , this upper bound for ǫ decreases exponentially with T at a rate which depends on γ . This behaviour , combined with other bounds on generalization error [ Freund and Schapire , 1997 ] , point out why the AdaBoost algorithm works as a boosting scheme : given suﬃcient data , it can eﬃciently employ weak learners – which perform always at least slightly better than random – to build a strong classiﬁer with an arbitrarily low error rate on the training set . On the other hand , an upper bound can also be established for the generalization error , i . e . for the rate of misclassiﬁcations in new data not used during the training stage . That upper bound relates to : a ) the error resulting from the training stage ˆ P [ H T ( ~ x ) 6 = y ] , b ) sample size n , c ) the dimensionality d H of the space H of weak learners , and d ) the number of boosting iterations T [ Freund and Schapire , 1997 , 1999 ] : ˆ P [ H T ( ~ x ) 6 = y ] + O   s T d H n   ( A . 103 ) Being T in the numerator inside the square root , ( A . 103 ) suggests that AdaBoost overﬁts if it is run for too many iteration , i . e . as T becomes excessively large . In practise , T is an essential hyperparameter for AdaBoost which needs to be pre - speciﬁed by the user , as well as the internal conﬁguration options governing the behaviour of the weak classiﬁers . In this regard , those weak learners do not need to be especially accurate ; otherwise , the gain supplied by the Boosting ensemble may be scarce . AdaBoost . M2 extension for multi - class problems AdaBoost was originally designed to deal with binary classiﬁcation problems ( ground truth class assignments y i ∈ { ± 1 } ) ) . Nonetheless , multi - class classiﬁcation problems can also be addressed , although adaptations are required . In this regard , AdaBoost . M1 is a direct generalization of AdaBoost suitable to work with weak learners which are robust enough as to guarantee ǫ [ t ] ≤ 12 even when the algorithms progresses for many iterations . However , taking into account that such a condition may be too restrictive in practice , other exten - sions have been described , of which the most commonly used is AdaBoost . M2 [ Freund and Schapire , 1997 ] . Given dataset D = n ( ~ x i , y i ) | ~ x i ∈ X ⊂ R d , y i ∈ Y = { 1 , . . . , C } ⊂ N o n i = 1 , with C > 2 ∈ N classes . Algorithmically , AdaBoost . M2 for multi - class problems is strongly based on AdaBoost’s standard version , with the following modiﬁcations : • Weak learners : h [ t ] ( ~ x , y ) : X × Y 7→ [ 0 , 1 ] ⊂ R ( A . 104 ) For a certain data input ~ x ∈ X and a candidate class correspondence y ∈ Y , the weak classiﬁer h ( ~ x , y ) yields a real - valued output in the interval [ 0 , 1 ] which shows its degree of belief that instance ~ x actually belongs to the y - th class . • Weights : in order to accommodate for multiple class options , weights w i [ t ] need to be expanded into the more general concept of ‘misclassiﬁcation penalties’ w i , y [ t ] for the i - th data item and the y - th candidate class . The former initialization of weights in ( A . 94 ) must be reformulated in consequence , again guaranteeing that penalties sum to 1 : w i , y [ t ] = 1 n 1 C − 1 ∀ i = 1 , . . . , n ∀ y ∈ Y − { y i } ( A . 105 ) 174 A . Mathematical foundations • Error rates : the former binary weighted error rate ǫ [ t ] in ( A . 95 ) is substituted in AdaBoost . M2 by a multi - class ‘pseudo - loss’ , deﬁned as follows : ǫ [ t ] = 1 2 n X i = 1 X y ∈ Y − { y i } w i , y [ t ] { 1 − h [ t ] ( ~ x i , y i ) + h [ t ] ( ~ x i , y ) } ( A . 106 ) • The update of penalties in ( A . 98 ) now becomes : w i , y [ t + 1 ] = w i , y [ t ] Z [ t ] exp ( − α [ t ] { 1 + h [ t ] ( ~ x i , y i ) − h [ t ] ( ~ x i , y ) } ) ( A . 107 ) • The ﬁnal robust classiﬁer H T : X 7→ Y is built as follows : H T ( ~ x ) = arg max y ∈ Y ( T X t = 1 α [ t ] h [ t ] ( ~ x , y ) ) ( A . 108 ) A . 4 Hidden Markov Models Discrete - time Markov processes are a ﬂexible mathematical framework , widely used across many ﬁelds to model the random evolution of an stochastic process over time . Their main applications include the extraction of temporal information from streams of data and their dynamics . The simplest form of a Markovian model , on which all other constructions are based , is known as the ﬁrst - order Markov chain ( Figure A . 10 ) . It encompasses two basic assumptions , namely : 1 . Limited horizon ( Markov property ) : The probability of encountering the process at a certain state Y t at the discrete time instant t depends only on the immediately precedent state , i . e . : p ( X t | X t − 1 , X t − 2 , . . . , X 1 ) = p ( X t | X t − 1 ) ( A . 109 ) 2 . Stationarity of the process : The probability of transitioning between any pair of states does not change over time : p ( X t | X t − 1 ) = p ( X 2 | X 1 ) ∀ t ( A . 110 ) Additionally , Hidden Markov Models ( HMM ) constitute an extension of ﬁrst - order Markov chains . HMMs cover a common situation in which the observable output process Y is a random variable which in turn depends on another random variable X which is non - measurable ( i . e . non - accessible or ‘hidden’ ) . Being X the core precess of interest , it can be modelled via a ﬁrst - order Markov chain ( Figure A . 11 ) which inﬂuences observations Y . In addition to the two previous premises , HMMs incorporate one extra assumption : 3 . Conditional independence of observations Y t : Given X = { X τ } Tτ = 1 , the sequence of all hidden states for X , as well as all other observations ˜Y t = { Y τ } T τ = 1 τ 6 = t , then observable states Y t is only conditionally dependent on the hidden state X t at the same instant t , and not on any other future or past , hidden or observable situations : p (cid:16) Y t | X , ˜Y t (cid:17) = p ( Y t | X t ) ∀ t ( A . 111 ) 175 A . 4 . Hidden Markov Models Figure A . 10 : Graphical representation of a ﬁrst - order Markov chain . Arrows , which repre - sent conditional dependency , connect a certain state only with the immediately successive one . Figure A . 11 : Graphical representation of a Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) . Those three assumptions in ( A . 109 ) – ( A . 111 ) can be summarized in the scheme of Figure A . 11 and in the following expressions [ Rabiner , 1989 ] : p ( X ) = p ( X 1 ) T (cid:24) t = 2 p ( X t | X t − 1 ) ( A . 112 ) p ( X , Y ) = p ( X 1 ) p ( Y 1 | X 1 ) T (cid:24) t = 2 p ( X t | X t − 1 ) p ( Y t | X t ) ( A . 113 ) where X = { X t } Tt = 1 and Y = { Y t } Tt = 1 . In addition , let { s i } Ni = 1 be the set of N possible hidden states for X , and { o k } Mk = 1 the M possible observable symbols for process Y . Notably , formulae in ( A . 112 ) – ( A . 113 ) admit a powerful and convenient matrix form [ Rabiner , 1989 ] with : • Transition matrix A of size N × N , whose elements a i , j reﬂect the probability of moving from a certain hidden state s i to another state s j in the immediately subsequent instant , i . e . : A ( a i , j ) a i , j = p ( X t = s j | X t − 1 = s i ) ∀ i , j = 1 , . . . , N ( A . 114 ) • Emission matrix B of size N × M , with elements b j , k representing the probability of a certain observable state o k for Y , given that the hidden Markov process X is currently at state s j : B ( b j , k ) b j , k = p ( Y t = o k | X t = s j ) ∀ j = 1 , . . . , N ∀ k = 1 , . . . , M ( A . 115 ) • Initial conditions vector Π of size 1 × N , where its elements π i cover the distribution of priors for all of the possible hidden states at the initial instant t = 1 : P i ( π i ) π i = p ( X 1 = s i ) ∀ i = 1 , . . . , N ( A . 116 ) Considering these deﬁnitions ( A . 114 ) – ( A . 116 ) , the vector Λ ( t ) of size 1 × M which reﬂects the distribution of probabilities for each the observable outputs at a time point t can be calculated as follows [ Rabiner , 1989 ] : Λ ( t ) = Π A t − 1 B ∀ t = 1 , . . . , T ( A . 117 ) As a consequence , the HMM is fully speciﬁed with the set of parameters Θ = { Π , A , B } . In the ﬁeld of automated pattern recognition , there are three main situations of interest in which HMMs may be useful [ Rabiner , 1989 ] : 176 A . Mathematical foundations 1 . To calculate the probability of occurrence for a certain sequence of observations Y – ‘evaluation problem’ . 2 . To ﬁnd the optimal sequence of hidden states X which most likely originated a given sequence of observable outputs – ‘decoding problem’ . 3 . To estimate the most suitable set of HMM model parameters Θ from observations Y and hidden states X – ‘learning problem’ . A . 4 . 1 Evaluation problem Let Y = { Y t = o k [ t ] } Tt = 1 be a known sequence of observable states o k [ t ] at time instants t . Given that in the context of this problem , model parameters Θ = { Π , A , B } are also completely speciﬁed , it would be possible to attempt to calculate the probability p ( Y | Θ ) by ‘brute force’ strategies , i . e . enumerating all possible hidden sequences X and working on this basis . However , there are as many as N T diﬀerent combinations X with length T . Thus , brute force might only be tractable for small values of T . Instead , there exists a much more eﬃcient approach , known as the ‘forward - backward’ procedure [ Rabiner , 1989 ] . Let us consider ‘forward’ variables α t ( i ) , deﬁned as the following probability term : α t ( i ) = p (cid:16) { Y τ = o k [ τ ] } tτ = 1 ; X t = s i | Θ (cid:17) ( A . 118 ) Using the concept in ( A . 118 ) , the evaluation problem can be solved through an inductive procedure with : • Initialization at instant t = 1 : α 1 ( i ) = π i b i , k [ 1 ] ∀ i = 1 , . . . , N ( A . 119 ) • Induction for t = 1 , . . . , T − 1 ( Figure A . 12 ) : α t + 1 ( j ) = ( N X i = 1 α t ( i ) a i , j ) b j , k [ t ] ∀ j = 1 , . . . , N ( A . 120 ) • Termination at t = T : p ( Y | Θ ) = N X j = 1 α T ( j ) ( A . 121 ) Although this ‘forward’ induction based on α ’s is suﬃcient for the evaluation task , a similar and complementary ‘backward’ induction procedure will be useful later on to solve the decoding and learning problems . Let ‘backward’ variables β t ( j ) be : β t ( i ) = p (cid:16) { Y τ = o k [ τ ] } Tτ = t + 1 | X t = s i ; Θ (cid:17) ( A . 122 ) • Initialization at instant t = T : β T ( i ) = 1 ∀ i = 1 , . . . , N ( A . 123 ) • Induction for t = T − 1 , . . . , 1 ( Figure A . 13 ) : β t ( i ) = N X j = 1 a i , j b j , k [ t + 1 ] β t + 1 ( j ) ∀ i = 1 , . . . , N ( A . 124 ) 177 A . 4 .

Figure A . 14 : HMM forward - backward induction for ξ variables . 178 A . Mathematical foundations A . 4 . 2 Decoding problem With HMM’s model parameters Θ being known , this task consists in which sequence of hidden states X most likely produced a given sequence of observations Y . In this regard , let us deﬁne magnitudes γ t ( i ) to represent the probability of a single hidden state s i at time t given Y , if considered isolated from all other hidden states at neighbouring instants : γ t ( i ) = p ( X t = s i | Y ; Θ ) ( A . 125 ) From deﬁnitions ( A . 118 ) , ( ? ? ) and ( A . 125 ) it is derived that γ t ( i ) can be calculated as follows : γ t ( i ) = α t ( i ) β t ( i ) p ( Y | Θ ) = α t ( i ) β t ( i ) P Ni = 1 α t ( i ) β t ( i ) ( A . 126 ) Intuitively , the optimization problem could be tackled in a naïve , local manner : choosing for X t the individual state that maximizes γ t for each instant t . However , such a criterion does not take into account transitions between contiguous states in time X t − 1 , X t , X t + 1 . Actually , it could occur that two consecutive instants were assigned to correspond to states s i , s j in spite of the fact that the direct transition from one to another may even be infeasible by deﬁnition ( i . e . a i , j = 0 ) ; hence invalidating the locally optimal solution . Therefore , the correct approach consists in optimizing the overall probability p ( X | Y ; Θ ) for the full sequence of data . To do so , Viterbi’s algorithm should be applied . A . 4 . 2 . 1 Viterbi’s algorithm Let us deﬁne auxiliary magnitudes δ t ( i ) as : δ t ( i ) = max s j [ τ ] τ = 1 , . . . , t − 1 (cid:26) p (cid:18) n X τ = s j [ τ ] o t τ = 1 ; n Y τ = o k [ τ ] o t τ = 1 | Θ (cid:19)(cid:27) ( A . 127 ) where δ t ( i ) represents the highest probability of : a ) coming through a certain path n s j [ τ ] o t − 1 τ = 1 of hidden states , b ) reaching hidden state X t = s i at current time t , and c ) hav - ing observed a sequence of symbols n o k [ τ ] o t τ = 1 . In addition , auxiliary variables ψ t ( i ) are necessary to trace back the most likely pathway of hidden states . In brief , Viterbi’s algorithm works by induction : • Initialization at t = 1 : ( δ 1 ( i ) = π i b i , k [ 1 ] ψ 1 ( i ) = 0 ∀ i = 1 , . . . , N ( A . 128 ) • Induction from t = 1 , . . . , T − 1 :   δ t + 1 ( j ) = max i = 1 , . . . , N δ t ( i ) a i , j b j , k [ t + 1 ] ψ t + 1 ( j ) = arg max i = 1 , . . . , N δ t ( i ) a i , j ∀ j = 1 , . . . , N ( A . 129 ) • Termination at t = T : s ⋆T = arg max j = 1 , . . . , N δ T ( j ) ( A . 130 ) being s ⋆ T the hidden state considered as optimal for X T , i . e . at the last time instant . 179 A . 4 . Hidden Markov Models • Backtracking of the optimal pathway via the stored ψ variables : s ⋆t = ψ t + 1 ( s ⋆t + 1 ) ∀ t = T − 1 , . . . , 1 ( A . 131 ) where the resulting sequence X ⋆ is then formed as follows : X ⋆ = { X t = s ⋆t } Tt = 1 ( A . 132 ) A . 4 . 3 Learning problem The aim here is to ascertain a set of parameters Θ = { Π , A , B } ( i . e . transition and emis - sion matrices A , B plus the vector of initial conditions Π ) deﬁning a HMM model which maximizes the overall posterior probability of the sequences { X , Y } supplied for training . Contrarily to the two previous tasks , this problem lacks an explicit analytical solution . Hence , this section presents the most commonly used approach , known as Baum - Welch’s algorithm ; although other solutions exist , e . g . based on Expectation - Maximization algo - rithms or on gradient - descent search [ Rabiner , 1989 ] . A . 4 . 3 . 1 Baum - Welch’s algorithm Let us deﬁne auxiliary magnitudes ξ t ( i , j ) to reﬂect the probability of the pair of consecutive hidden states X t = s i , X t + 1 = s j given the sequence of observations Y : ξ t ( i , j ) = p ( X t = s i , X t + 1 = s j | Y ; Θ ) = p ( X t = s i , X t + 1 = S j ; Y | Θ ) p ( Y | Θ ) ( A . 133 ) Variables ξ can be calculated by means of a ‘forward - backward’ propagation ( Figure A . 14 ) : ξ t ( i , j ) = α t ( i ) a i , j b j , k [ t + 1 ] β t + 1 ( j ) p ( Y | Θ ) ( A . 134 ) = α t ( i ) a i , j b j , k [ t + 1 ] β t + 1 ( j ) P Ni = 1 P Nj = 1 α t ( i ) a i , j b j , k [ t + 1 ] β t + 1 ( j ) ( A . 135 ) From deﬁnitions ( A . 125 ) and ( A . 133 ) , it can be derived [ Rabiner , 1989 ] that : γ t ( i ) = N X j = 1 ξ t ( i , j ) ( A . 136 ) Besides , if γ t ( i ) are summed over variable t along the temporal sequence , the resulting value can be interpreted as an estimation of the expected number of occasions ˆ E i in which the i - th hidden state s i was visited . Or equivalently , excluding instant t = T , it can be thought as the number of transitions which occurred departing from s i : ˆ E i = T − 1 X t = 1 γ t ( i ) ( A . 137 ) In a similar manner and attending to the deﬁnition of auxiliary variables ξ t ( i , j ) in ( A . 133 ) , a reasonable estimation of the expected number of transitions ˆ E i , j from s i to s j would be : ˆ E i , j = T − 1 X t = 1 ξ t ( i , j ) ( A . 138 ) 180 A . Mathematical foundations Using these two concepts ( A . 137 ) – ( A . 138 ) , plus the idea of counting expected occurrences along time ; Baum - Welch’s algorithm iteratively re - estimates an approximate set of param - eters ˆΘ with : ˆ π i ← γ 1 ( i ) ∀ i = 1 , . . . , N ( A . 139 ) whereas estimations for transitions ˆ a i , j would be : ˆ a i , j ← ˆ E i , j ˆ E i = P T − 1 t = 1 ξ t ( i , j ) P T − 1 t = 1 γ t ( i ) ∀ i , j = 1 , . . . , N ( A . 140 ) and with a comparable reasoning : ˆ b j , k ← P Tt = 1 | Y t = o k γ t ( j ) P Tt = 1 γ t ( j ) ∀ j = 1 , . . . , N ∀ k = 1 , . . . , M ( A . 141 ) To summarize Baum - Welch’s methodology , the currently available best model estimate Θ is employed to compute the right - hand sides of equations ( A . 139 ) – ( A . 141 ) , with which the subsequent estimate ˆΘ gets iteratively re - computed , in the manner of Expectation - Maximization ( EM ) algorithms . In fact , Baum - Welch’s is essentially an EM algorithm [ Rabiner , 1989 ] . 181 A . 4 . Hidden Markov Models 182 Bibliography ActiGraph LLC .
