Between 6 and 10 March 2020 , several MGEs related to the Falles festival took place in Borriana , a municipality in the province of Castellon ( Spain ) . The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of COVID - 19 and its association with these MGEs , and to quantify the potential risk factors of its occurrence . Methods During May and June 2020 , a population - based retrospective cohort study was carried out by the Public Health Center of Castello´ and the Hospital de la Plana in Vila - real . Participants were obtained from a representative sample of 1663 people with potential exposure at six MGEs . A questionnaire survey was carried out to obtain information about attendance at MGEs and COVID - 19 disease . In addition , a serologic survey of antibodies against SARS - Cov - 2 was implemented . Inverse probability weighted regression was used in the statistical analysis . Results A total of 1338 subjects participated in the questionnaire survey ( 80 . 5 % ) , 997 of whom undertook the serologic survey . Five hundred and seventy cases were observed with an attack rate ( AR ) of 42 . 6 % ; average age was 36 years , 62 . 3 % were female , 536 cases were confirmed by laboratory tests , and 514 cases were found with SARS - CoV - 2 total antibodies .

Considering MGE exposure , AR was 39 . 2 % ( 496 / 1264 ) . A dose - response relationship was found between MGE attendance and the disease , ( adjusted relative risk [ aRR ] = 4 . 11 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 3 . 25 – 5 . 19 ) . Two MGEs with a dinner and dance in the same building had higher risks . Associated risk factors with the incidence were older age , obesity , and upper and middle class versus lower class ; current smoking was protective . Conclusions The study suggests the significance of MGEs in the COVID - 19 transmission that could explain the subsequent outbreak in Borriana . Introduction Mass gathering events ( MGEs ) are important risk factors of severe acute respiratory coronavi - rus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) transmissions , which causes coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pan - demic [ 1 ] . According to the World Health Organization [ 2 ] “Mass gatherings are events characterized by the concentration of people at a specific location for a specific purpose over a set period of time that have the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the host country or community” . MGEs cover different types of event and contexts such as public and private celebrations , festivals , religious events and pilgrimages , sporting and touristic events , and political meetings . The crucial role of MGEs in the global propagation of the dis - ease has been evidenced in several countries , including China [ 3 ] , Iran [ 4 ] , Malaysia [ 5 ] , Italy [ 6 ] , Spain [ 7 ] , France [ 8 ] , Germany [ 9 ] , Jordan [ 10 ] , Malta [ 11 ] , Switzerland [ 12 ] , and Malawi [ 13 ] . Significant international efforts have been made to implement specific measures , risk assessment and surveillance , and event cancellations in order to prevent the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 from MGEs [ 14 – 17 ] . The propagation of SARS - CoV - 3 in these MGEs was measured with the basic reproductive number ( Ro ) , which reflects the efficiency of transmission of the disease [ 18 ] , and “is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single ( typical ) infection in a completely susceptible population” [ 19 ] . A meta - analysis of medical lit - erature estimated a Ro = 3 . 38 ± 1 . 40 from a range of 1 . 90 – 6 . 49 for the COVID - 19 pandemic [ 20 ] . MGEs imply the gathering of people in restricted spaces , either indoor or outdoor , over a prolonged period of time , where food and / or drink are generally consumed , usually in close proximity to others , and involving the movement of populations [ 14 , 21 – 23 ] . The conditions of MGEs have been associated with the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 , but few MGE studies [ 24 , 25 ] have published quantification and adjustment for potential risk factors . In addition , several epidemiologic biases such as selection and misclassification have been observed in some stud - ies of SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks , considering the novelty of the disease and the emergency situa - tion [ 26 ] . Spain has had a high incidence of COVID - 19 [ 27 , 28 ] , with a large number of COVID - 19 outbreaks occurring in households , nursing homes , hospitals , workplaces and leisure facilities [ 29 – 33 ] . We studied a MGE COVID - 19 outbreak that took place in the first wave of the pan - demic . During March and April 2020 in Borriana , a municipality with 34 , 683 inhabitants located in the province of Castellon in the Valencian Community ( Spain ) , a COVID - 19 out - break occurred with an incidence of 260 cases ( 749 . 6 cases per 100 , 000 inhabitants ) confirmed by reverse - transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) [ 34 ] . Between February and the first days of March 2020 , before the COVID - 19 outbreak in Borriana , several MGEs took place PLOS ONE Mass gatheringevents and COVID - 19 transmission PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0256747 August 26 , 2021 2 / 29 Data Availability Statement : All relevantdata are withinthe manuscriptand its Supporting Informationfiles . Funding : The author ( s ) receivedno specific fundingfor this work . Competinginterests : The authorshave declared that no competinginterest exist . in connection with the traditional Falles festival , which is held annually in Borriana . Our hypothesis was that the MGEs held during the Falles festival were associated with the COVID - 19 outbreak in Borriana . Using a population - based retrospective cohort study , we aimed to estimate the association of the incidence of COVID - 19 disease with the MGEs in Borriana , and quantify potential risk factors of its occurrence . Material and methods Description of MGEs during the Falles festival in Borriana Borriana is a municipality located 5 . 7 km from the Mediterranean Sea in the province of Cas - tellon , Spain . A series of MGEs took place between March 6 and 10 , 2020 during the traditional Falles festival in Borriana . This popular festival is organized by people in the town’s different neighborhoods , clustered in social groups , known as a “ falla ” ( singular ) or “ falles ” ( plural ) , with the purpose of bringing the festivities to the streets . Falles groups consider themselves as a large family . Their final objective is to build a monument with humorous scenes of daily life , which is burned on March 19 [ 35 , 36 ] . During the 2020 festivities , 19 falles with a total of 2800 members were active in Borriana ; each group had between 26 and 384 people and a median of 143 members . The members of the falles comprise around 8 . 1 % of Borriana’s population . The MGEs analyzed in this study took place in three locations : building A , purposely designed for MGEs with a surface area of 1670 m 2 and a capacity of 900 people ( three events ) ; theater B ( two events and a capacity of 884 ) , and an outdoor square in the city of Valencia . Building A and theater B had air conditioning and ventilation equipment . The MGEs are described below : First , a pa - i - porta ( ‘bring your own’ supper ) ( building A ; March 6 ) , a community dinner with an estimated total attendance of approximately 1400 people over a seven hour period ( 9 : 30 p . m . to 4 : 30 a . m . ) and dancing after midnight . Second , the Queen’s gala dinner ( building A ; March 7 ) , with 400 people gathered together over six and a half hours ( 10 : 00 p . m . to 4 : 30 a . m . ) and dancing after midnight . A detailed list of attendees and their distribution in building A was available . Third , a trip to see fireworks in a square in Valencia ( March 8 ) . About 800 people gathered for half an hour ( at 2 : 00 p . m . ) . Fourth , a senior citizens’ dance ( building A ; March 8 ) . Around 100 people attended for one and a half hours ( 5 : 30 p . m . to 7 : 00 p . m . ) . Fifth , the theater awards gala ( theater B ; March 8 ) : indoor show attended by 300 people for two hours ( 7 : 00 p . m . to 9 : 00 p . m . ) . Sixth , the Queen’s offering ( theater B ; March 10 ) : a show attended by 400 people for one and a half hours ( 10 : 30 p . m . to 0 : 00 a . m . ) . A summary of the characteristics of these MGEs is presented in Table 1 . Design of the study A population - based retrospective cohort study was carried out from May 14 to June 31 , 2020 in Borriana . The study was jointly designed by the Public Health Center of Castellon and the Emergency Service of the Hospital de la Plana ( HP ) in Vila - real . The study had two phases : 1 ) a survey with a specific questionnaire to estimate the incidence of COVID - 19 , and 2 ) a sero - logic study of antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 to confirm cases with laboratory tests and to uncover the extent of the infection and the epidemic situation . PLOS ONE Mass gatheringevents and COVID - 19 transmission PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0256747 August 26 , 2021 3 / 29 Questionnaire survey In the first phase , starting on May 14 , 2020 , a standardized questionnaire was administered to obtain information about MGE exposure , demographic characteristics , occupation , habits , health condition , symptoms of the disease , the evolution of COVID - 19 disease , previously con - ducted COVID - 19 laboratory tests , and family members affected by COVID - 19 . The study period covering COVID - 19 cases ranged from January 1 to June 31 , 2020 . The questionnaire was completed through a telephone survey carried out by the health staff of HP , Borriana health centers , and other health centers in the Health Department of La Plana in Vila - real , Cas - tellon . In the telephone survey , parents were requested to ask the questions to their children when a child had been chosen in the simple random sampling . In general , parents were able to answer the questionnaire . Social class was estimated from occupations ; children’s social class was that of their parents . Two groups were considered : I and II included professional , manage - rial and technical occupations ( upper and middle class ) ; group III - VI included skilled , non - manual or manual , semi - skilled , and unskilled occupations ( lower class ) . Participants were recruited from two sources . First , a representative sample of the 19 falles ( n = 2800 members ) was obtained by simple random sampling with design effect 1 and 19 clusters ( one per falla ) , considering an attack rate of COVID - 19 disease of 50 % in MGEs , a confidence level of 80 % , and an alpha error 5 % . The sample comprised 1558 people , which corresponds to 82 people per falla for those with a population larger than 82 , or all the mem - bers of the falla for those with a population smaller than 82 . The Open - Epi program [ 37 ] was used to randomly select the participants from a numbered list of all members of each falla until 82 people , including adults and children , were obtained . The phone numbers of each selected participant or their family member were then obtained from the Borriana Falles orga - nization . Second , in order to maximize the number of participants from the Queen’s gala din - ner ( n = 400 ) , given that the complete list of attendees to the event was available , an additional random sample of 105 people from the list of diners was recruited . The same procedure described above was used to randomly select the 105 people . Serologic survey and laboratory tests During the second phase , a serologic survey of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibody prevalence was car - ried out from 23 to 27 June 2020 by the Clinical Analysis and Microbiology Service ( CAMS ) of HP . Qualitative detection of antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 was carried out by an electroche - miluminescence immunoassay ( ECLIA ) ( Elecsys 1 Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 , Roche Diagnostics ) [ 38 ] . IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 were detected by a lateral flow immuno - chromatographic assay ( LFIC ) ( Healgen Scientific LLC for COVID - 19 IgG / IgM rapid test cas - sette ) [ 39 ] .

These data consisted of 1 ) RT - PCR tests , including LightMix 1 Modular Sarbecovirus E - gene with the LightCycler 1 480 II system ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) [ 40 ] , 2 ) ECLIA with LFIC , and 3 ) rapid anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibody tests . These tests were conducted by HP and other public and private laboratories . Case definitions A probable COVID - 19 case was defined as a patient who presented clinical and epidemiologi - cal criteria of COVID - 19 disease during the study period , according to the case - definition pro - posed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention [ 41 ] . Clinical and epidemiological criteria must fulfill two conditions . The first is the reporting of at least two of the following symptoms : fever , chills , rigors , myalgia , headache , sore throat , and new olfactory and taste dis - order ; or one of the following symptoms : cough , shortness of breath , or difficulty breathing ; or severe respiratory illness such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome . The sec - ond condition is contact with a confirmed COVID - 19 patient , or living in an area where a COVID - 19 outbreak has been reported . A confirmed COVID - 19 case was defined as a patient who had positive antibodies of SARS - CoV - 2 by ECLIA with LFIC , positive PCR , or positive rapid anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibody tests during the study period . Non - cases ( negative cases ) were defined as participants who had no COVID - 19 clinical cri - teria or had negative COVID - 19 test results during the study period . Statistical methods The program Epi - Info 1 version 7 [ 42 ] was used to calculate the sample size . COVID - 19 attack rates ( AR ) were estimated as the quotient between cases and total exposed population , considering different variables . To estimate the risk of the MGEs , COVID - 19 cases with onset of symptoms between March 6 and 31 , 2020 were included . The pa - i - porta and Queen’s gala dinner MGE events were analyzed in greater detail than the other events , considering the attendance population and the potential risk of COVID - 19 . Chi2 and Fisher’s exact test were used in the comparisons among variables . Associations of risk factors with COVID - 19 were measured by the relative risk ( RR ) using Poisson regression and multilevel Poisson regression , considering falles as a level group with a 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . In order to adjust for potential confounding factors , the directed acyclic graphs ( DAGs ) method [ 43 ] was used with the DAGitty 1 program ( version 3 . 0 ) [ 44 ] , together with inverse probability weighted regression [ 45 ] to obtain adjusted AR ( aAR ) and RR ( aRR ) . The DAG provides a picture of the relationship between an exposure ( mass gather - ing event ) and an outcome ( COVID - 19 disease ) and factors that could be potential confound - ers . An adjustment was made for these factors . The factors were age , sex , social class ( upper and middle class versus lower class ) , chronic illness , family COVID - 19 case and falla ( social group ) ; all these factors could alter the relationship between exposure and outcome . In addi - tion , a sensitivity analysis was carried out including participants who were tested for COVID - 19 disease , to gain more specificity of the results . The Stata 1 program ( version 14 ) [ 46 ] was used in the calculation . Ethical aspects The study was approved by the director of the Public Health Center of Castellon and the man - agement of the Health Department of La Plana , taking into account the situation of the COVID - 19 pandemic in the province of Castellon . Participation was voluntary , and after an PLOS ONE Mass gatheringevents and COVID - 19 transmission PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0256747 August 26 , 2021 5 / 29 explanation of the study objective , oral informed consent was obtained from all participants ( or their parents , in the case of minors ) included in the study . To ensure explicit consent , sev - eral clarifications were made before administering the survey questionnaire , including volun - tary participation , the option to withdraw from the study without prejudice , the opportunity to receive information about the study , a guarantee that personal information would be kept in the strictest confidentiality and that privacy would be safeguarded as the data collected would be used anonymously for scientific research ; the researcher responsible for data collec - tion was identified . When a child was selected in the sampling process , permission to partici - pate was requested from their parents , who would also help them to answer the questionnaire ; all the above clarifications were also made before the survey questionnaire was administered . Results Description of participants in the questionnaire survey Participation rates in the questionnaire survey were 80 . 5 % ( 1338 / 1663 ) ( Fig 1 ) . Participation was higher among females than males ( 58 . 9 % versus 41 . 1 % ) . The mean age was 33 . 9 ± 17 . 8 years ( rank of 1 – 80 years ) ( Table 2 ) . The most represented age groups were 45 – 64 years ( 28 . 2 % ) and 15 – 24 years ( 20 . 1 % ) , and the least represented groups were 1 – 4 years ( 2 . 3 % ) and 65 years and above ( 3 . 4 % ) ( Table 2 ) . The occupation III - VI group ( lower class ) was higher than the I - II group ( upper and middle classes ) ( 74 . 3 % versus 25 . 7 % ) ( Table 2 ) . Chronic illness was present in 30 . 9 % of participants . The pa - i - porta event was the most highly attended MGE ( 60 . 5 % ) , followed by the Queen’s gala dinner ( 24 . 8 % ) . The theater award gala ( 12 . 4 % ) and the senior citizens’ dance ( 2 . 8 % ) had the lowest attendances ( Table 2 ) . A total of 397 participants in the questionnaire survey ( 25 . 3 % ) did not attend any MGEs . Description of participants in the serologic survey and COVID - 19 laboratory tests A total of 1132 participants ( 84 . 6 % ) underwent laboratory tests for COVID - 19 disease ( Table 2 ) , considering both the tests carried out as part of the serologic survey ( n = 997 ) and those from private and public medical laboratories ( n = 135 ) ( Fig 1 , see Methods for further information ) . Participation rates in the serologic survey were 74 . 5 % ( 997 / 1338 ) . Female partic - ipation in laboratory tests for COVID - 19 ( including both the serologic survey and medical rec - ords ) was higher ( 60 . 1 % ) than that of males ( 39 . 9 % ) . The mean age of participants that underwent a COVID - 19 laboratory test was 36 . 9 ± 17 . 1 years . The 45 – 64 years and 15 – 24 years age groups were the most highly represented ( 30 . 8 % and 19 . 2 % , respectively ) , while 0 – 4 years ( 1 . 8 % ) and 65 years and above ( 3 . 4 % ) were the least represented ( Table 2 ) . Participation of the occupation III - VI group ( lower class ) was higher than in the I - II group ( upper and mid - dle class ) ( 74 . 2 % versus 25 . 0 % ) ( Table 2 ) . A total of 32 . 2 % of the participants reported suffering from a chronic illness ( Table 2 ) . MGE attendance among participants with COVID - 19 labora - tory tests showed the pa - i - porta event as the most highly attended event ( 65 . 4 % ) , again fol - lowed by the Queen’s gala dinner ( 28 . 9 % ) , while the theater award gala ( 13 . 3 % ) and the senior citizens’ dance ( 3 . 4 % ) had the lowest attendance ( Table 2 ) . A total of 274 participants ( 24 . 1 % ) with COVID - 19 laboratory tests did not attend any MGEs ( Table 2 ) . Description of COVID - 19 outbreak During the study period , 570 COVID - 19 cases were found ( Fig 1 , Table 2 ) . Among these , 536 ( 94 . 0 % ) were confirmed cases with positive COVID - 19 laboratory tests and 34 ( 6 . 0 % ) were probable cases as diagnosed according to clinical and epidemiological criteria ( Fig 1 ) . PLOS ONE Mass gatheringevents and COVID - 19 transmission PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0256747 August 26 , 2021 6 / 29 Specifically , confirmed cases included 514 participants ( 90 . 2 % ) with positive total anti - SARS - - CoV - 2 antibodies ( 32 of whom also reported a positive PCR test ) , seven participants ( 1 . 2 % ) with positive PCR only ( a total of 39 participants had a positive PCR , 6 . 8 % ) , and 15 partici - pants ( 2 . 6 % ) with positive rapid anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibody tests . From the subset of 997 par - ticipants in the serologic survey , 508 were positive for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibodies , and eight participants were also positive for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM antibodies . AR was 42 . 6 % ( 570 / 1338 ) among total participants , 47 . 3 % ( 536 / 1132 ) among participants undergoing Fig 1 . Flow diagram of the study population in the MGEs in Borriana between January and June 2020 . COVID - 19 cases included those diagnosed by laboratory tests ( confirmed cases ) or by clinical and epidemiological criteria ( probable cases ) . Cases confirmed by laboratory tests included participants with positive results from the serologic survey as well as from private and public medical laboratories . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0256747 . g001 PLOS ONE Mass gatheringevents and COVID - 19 transmission PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0256747 August 26 , 2021 7 / 29 laboratory tests , and 16 . 5 % ( 34 / 206 ) among those classified according to clinical and epidemi - ological criteria ( Fig 1 ) . The temporal distribution of confirmed and probable COVID - 19 cases is shown by onset of symptoms ( Fig 2 ) . The first cases were reported on 28 and 29 January 2020 . The incidence then slowly progressed during February with a small peak of cases on March 2 . Two maximum peaks of cases occurred on March 9 ( 45 cases ) and March 16 ( 49 cases ) . After April , only iso - lated cases were reported , which is consistent with the general lockdown in Spain that was implemented on March 15 . According to these observations , the distribution of COVID - 19 cases in this study showed a bimodal epidemic curve with two maxima . Interestingly , the aforementioned peaks took place between 3 and 10 days after the MGEs ( see Methods for fur - ther information ) . This indicates several point sources of the outbreak , with the pa - i - porta and Queen’s gala dinner events being the first ones on March 6 and 7 , respectively . Table 2 .

The AR for males ( 39 . 1 % ) was smaller than for females ( 45 . 1 % ) ( RR = 0 . 87 , 95 % CI 0 . 73 – 1 . 03 ) ( Table 2 ) . Similarly , COVID - 19 incidence was lower in males than in females for both confirmed ( 44 . 9 % versus 49 . 0 % ) and probable cases ( 12 . 2 % versus 20 . 4 % ) , although differences in AR were not significant . Regarding age , cases were older than non - cases ( 36 . 4 ± 17 . 1 years versus 32 . 0 ± 18 . 0 years ; p < 0 . 001 ) ( Table 3 ) . When split by age groups , the highest ARs were found in the 55 – 64 years group ( 50 . 1 % ) and the 35 – 44 years group ( 47 . 3 % ) , whereas the lowest ARs were observed in the 0 – 4 years group ( 25 . 8 % ) and 5 – 14 years group ( 30 . 5 % ) ( Table 3 ) , but no significant differ - ences were observed among age groups when models were adjusted for falla . Regarding the clinical presentation of the disease , a total of 503 cases ( 88 . 2 % ) , including 469 confirmed cases and 34 probable cases , showed COVID - 19 illness . The signs and symptoms reported by COVID - 19 patients included weakness ( 56 . 3 % ) , fever ( 55 . 1 % ) , loss of smell and / or taste ( 53 . 8 % ) , myalgia ( 51 . 3 % ) , headache ( 46 . 2 % ) cough ( 49 . 0 % ) , sore throat ( 35 . 7 % ) , coryza ( 31 . 8 % ) , diarrhea ( 26 . 6 % ) , dermatologic lesions ( 12 . 1 % ) , vomiting ( 5 . 7 % ) dyspnea ( 4 . 6 % ) and pneumonia ( 2 . 4 % ) . The average disease duration was 16 . 1 ± 20 . 9 days , with a median of 7 . 0 days ( rank 1 – 100 ) . Long - term symptoms or aftermaths of COVID - 19 were reported in 6 . 6 % of cases . Of note , 247 cases ( 43 . 4 % ) sought medical assistance and 13 cases ( 2 . 3 % ) required hospi - talization due to COVID - 19 . Only one death attributable to COVID - 19 was reported during the period of the study . On the other hand , asymptomatic cases made up 12 . 5 % of all con - firmed cases ( 67 / 536 ) , with an average age of 25 . 2 ± 17 . 6 years . No differences in the number of asymptomatic cases were found between males and females . Among total cases , 33 . 5 % reported having a chronic disease , the most frequent of which were cardiovascular disease , hypertension , allergic rhinitis , and hypothyroidism ( Table 3 ) . No significant associations with COVID - 19 incidence were found in any of the analyzed diseases . Finally , the effect of having a family member with COVID - 19 at the time of disease onset was analyzed . AR among those participants who reported having a COVID - 19 positive family member was 57 . 7 % ( 347 / 601 ) . In contrast , AR among participants who did not report a COVID - 19 positive family member Fig 2 . Temporal distribution of COVID - 19 cases by onset of symptoms .

Therefore , having a family member with COVID - 19 increased the risk of COVID - 19 incidence ( RR = 1 . 91 , 95 % CI 1 . 59 – 2 . 23 ) ( Table 3 ) . Analysis of COVID - 19 outbreak and MGEs General analysis of MGEs . Considering the dates of the MGEs ( 6 and 10 March 2020 ) and the temporal distribution of COVID - 19 cases in the study ( Fig 2 ) , the analysis focused fur - ther on COVID - 19 cases attributable to the MGEs associated with the Falles in Borriana . The 74 cases that presented the onset of symptoms or a positive test obtained before March 6 or after March 31 were therefore excluded since their illness onset ( before the MGEs or more than three weeks after the last MGE ) could not be related to the studied MGEs . Consequently , 1264 participants were included in the analysis with 496 cases , and AR of 39 . 2 % ( 496 / 1264 ) . DAGs were used to study MGEs ( exposure ) and COVID - 19 disease ( outcome ) and potential confounding factors ( Fig 3 ) . Raw AR and adjusted ( aAR ) , as well as RR and aRR , of MGEs are presented in Table 4 . The aRR of males and females did not differ significantly . The aRR increased with age , from 0 – 4 years ( aAR = 17 . 0 % ) to 35 – 44 years , which presented the highest values ( aAR = 46 . 9 % ) ( aRR = 2 . 77 95 % CI 1 . 30 – 5 . 88 ) . The age groups of 45 – 64 years and 65 years and above also presented high values ( aAR = 44 . 2 % ) ( aRR = 2 . 60 95 % CI 1 . 22 – 5 . 52 ) and ( aAR = 39 . 2 % ) ( aRR = 2 . 31 95 % CI 1 . 07 – 4 . 99 ) , respectively . In addition , COVID - 19 disease was associated with occupations I - II ( upper and middle class ) ( aRR = 1 . 22 95 % CI 1 . 06 – 1 . 40 ) . Those who had a family member with COVID - 19 had a higher risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion ( aRR = 1 . 71 95 % CI 1 . 49 – 1 . 97 ) . Additionally , the risk of contracting COVID - 19 increased with higher body mass index ( BMI ) , up to the group of 30 Kg / m 2 or higher ( aRR = 3 . 21 95 % CI 1 . 29 – 7 . 98 ) , and marginally with habitual alcoholic beverage consumption ( aRR = 1 . 14 95 % CI 0 . 99 – 1 . 32 ) . Chronic illness and physical exercise were not associated with contracting COVID - 19 . On the other hand , the current smoker group presented lower risk ( aRR = 0 . 63 95 % CI 0 . 52 – 0 . 78 ) . Regarding MGEs , the aAR ranged from 62 . 0 % ( the Queen’s offering ) to 47 . 9 % ( the Valencia trip ) . The disease was associated with the pa - i - porta event with an aRR of Fig 3 .

The other MGEs had lower aRR , but still presented a significant and considerable risk ( Table 4 ) . When MGE exposure was measured by the number of events the participants had attended , a dose - response relationship was found with raw and adjusted AR . The aAR for par - ticipants who attended no MGEs was 18 . 9 % , increasing to 77 . 7 % for participants who attended five MGEs ( aRR = 4 . 11 95 % CI 3 . 25 – 5 . 19 ) . Analysis of the pa - i - porta event . The analysis of the MGE with the highest number of participants , the pa - i - porta , together with different exposure variables , is shown in Table 5 . The aRR by sex was similar in females and males . Interestingly , COVID - 19 disease was marginally associated with the total time attended in a dose - response relationship from less than half of the event up to the whole event ( aRR = 1 . 32 95 % CI 0 . 98 – 1 . 74 ) . The food or alco - holic beverages provided by the event organizers , or those brought to the event by the partici - pants ( which included cakes or other foods ) were not associated with the disease . Participants who did not participate in the dinner and only attended the dance had a lower risk , but with limited effect ( aRR = 0 . 84 95 % CI 0 . 67 – 1 . 16 ) . In addition , more time spent dancing was a mar - ginal risk factor ( aRR = 1 . 19 95 % CI 0 . 96 – 1 . 48 ) . Two groups of participants were defined according to whether or not they shared a dinner table with a participant reporting onset of COVID - 19 symptoms between February 26 and March 6 . The exposed group presented a higher aAR of disease than those who were not exposed , 55 . 7 % versus 25 . 5 % ( aRR = 2 . 19 95 % CI 1 . 40 – 3 . 42 ) . Finally , the location and distribution of the dinner tables in building A were analyzed . To this end , the dinner tables were classified into four quadrants and an adjusted analysis was carried out . Results showed that the upper right quadrant had a higher COVID - 19 incidence than the lower right quadrant ( aRR = 1 . 44 95 % 1 . 12 – 1 . 85 ) , but no difference was found with the other quadrants ( Table 5 ) . Analysis of the Queen’s gala dinner event . The Queen’s gala dinner was the MGE with the second highest number of participants in the study ( Table 6 ) . The aRR by sex was similar in females and males . The time of attendance at this event presented a dose - response relation - ship from less than half attendance to whole event attendance ( aRR = 1 . 76 95 % CI 1 . 18 – 2 . 62 ) . At dinner , several dishes were consumed : starters ( tomato bread , pork sausages , cheese and foie gras salad and scallops ) , second course ( sirloin ) , and dessert ( chocolate cream ) . The con - sumption of these foods and alcoholic beverages was not associated with COVID - 19 risk . Next , two groups of participants were defined according to whether or not they shared a din - ing table with a participant with COVID - 19 disease and symptoms onset between February 27 and March 7 . The exposed group showed a higher aAR than the non - exposed group ( 76 . 1 % and 58 . 6 % , respectively ) ( aRR = 1 . 30 95 % 1 . 10 – 1 . 53 ) . The adjusted analysis of the incidence of COVID - 19 cases across the four quadrants of tables in building A ( same building as for the pa - i - porta event ) , revealed that the lower left quadrant had the highest COVID - 19 incidence and differed from that of the lower right quadrant , which was the one with the lowest incidence ( aRR = 1 . 29 95 % 1 . 00 – 1 . 65 ) . No differences were found with the other table quadrants Table 4 .

Discussion The results of this study indicate a high transmission of COVID - 19 disease in the MGEs stud - ied , which may be considered as a community outbreak with several point sources from March 6 to 10 [ 47 ] . Respiratory transmission was the predominant mode of propagation by droplets from patients to exposed persons ; contact via fomites was less frequent [ 48 , 49 ] .

The two MGEs with the highest incidence of the disease included a dinner , as in other COVID - 19 outbreaks , but food - borne transmission can be dis - carded in this study [ 53 , 54 ] . Some characteristics of this MEG outbreak may be highlighted , including its magnitude and impact in the population of Borriana , the diversity of places where it occurred indoors ( building and theater ) and outdoors ( square ) , the higher risk of COVID - 19 associated with the number of MGEs attended , the estimation of risk for attendance at no MGEs , the detection of Table 8 .

In the study , the AR was 42 . 6 % , and during the period of the MGEs , 39 . 2 % with 94 . 0 % of confirmed cases . If the AR were extrapolated to falles members , the total of COVID - 19 cases could be between 1193 ( 95 % CI 1269 – 1117 ) and 1098 ( 95 % CI 1173 – 1023 ) , respectively . In addition , a high proportion of cases had family members with COVID - 19 , suggesting a high secondary transmission among families , in line with Thompson and co - authors and with a study of secondary attack rate of COVID - 19 infections in Castellon [ 55 , 56 ] . It may explain the high incidence in the municipality of Borriana , which was the highest in the province of Cas - tellon during the first outbreak period . Considering the period February to July 2020 , the inci - dence of COVID - 19 in Borriana was 307 cases with positive PCR results ( 885 per 100 , 000 inhabitants ) and 40 deaths ( 1 . 2 per 1000 inhabitants ) [ 34 ] . As a comparison , the COVID - 19 incidence in Castellon de la Plana , the provincial capital ( 170 , 000 inhabitants ) , was 463 cases ( 272 . 4 per 100 , 000 inhabitants ) and 50 deaths ( 0 . 29 per 1 , 000 inhabitants ) . The high mortality in Borriana is striking [ 57 , 58 ] , and it may be related to the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in this municipality [ 59 ] . Regarding the incidence of COVID - 19 , the study found 536 confirmed cases , 39 cases with positive PCR results ; these were the only cases reported by the health authorities . It may be estimated that for every reported case , there could have been around 13 or 14 cases , implying that 92 . 7 % of cases were undiagnosed . This situation is in line with two studies on undocumented infections of SARS - CoV - 2 in China ( 86 % and 93 % ) , and France ( 86 % ) , respectively [ 60 – 62 ] . In the context of COVID - 19 outbreaks related to MGEs , different models have been pro - posed to estimate the number of cases deriving from MGEs or Ro values [ 63 , 64 ] . Apart from assuming several premises , these models need a constant infection rate or Ro . As a tentative approximation and using the classic SIR ( susceptible , infected , recovered ) infection process model [ 65 ] , we explored our results to obtain the Ro from the infection rate based on the date of onset of cases , number of contacts , and duration of infectiousness . We used the formula [ 66 ] : Ro ¼ PI x CR x DI where PI = “average probability a contact will be infected over duration of a relationship” ; CR = “average rate of getting into contact” ; and DI = “average duration infectiousness” . We defined PI , the infection rate , as new cases of COVID - 19 divided by the susceptible partici - pants per day ; CR as a number of potential contacts , following the study of Tupper and co - authors [ 63 ] , and DI as 10 days duration of infectiousness [ 67 ] . We considered a period of 19 days from the first MGE to the last MGE , plus a 14 - day maximum incubation period for COVID - 19 . The results are shown in Table 9 . Considering the infection rate per day , an increase was observed from 0 . 00172 on the first day to 0 . 04810 on March 16 and a decline until 0 . 00811 on March 25 . The countrywide lock - down began on March 15 and has been shown to have had a high effect [ 68 ] . With five con - tacts , Ro > 1 . 0 reached only 8 days and a maximum of 2 . 41 ; with 10 contacts , Ro > 1 . 0 reached 13 days and a maximum of 4 . 81 ; and with 15 contacts , Ro > 1 . 0 reached 19 days and a maxi - mum of 7 . 22 on the 16th day . The decline of the Ro was very steep from the maximum and Ro < 1 . 0 values were observed , indicating that the epidemic would soon decline [ 69 ] . These results reflect the high transmission of the disease associated with MGEs . To explore the expected numbers of cases in the COVID - 19 outbreak associated with the MGEs , we followed the approach of Tupper and co - authors [ 63 ] , considering the probability of infection ( β ) , the duration time ( T ) , time of contact ( τ ) and the number of contacts ( k ) . We PLOS ONE Mass gatheringevents and COVID - 19 transmission PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0256747 August 26 , 2021 18 / 29 calculated k from two MGEs ( pa - i - porta and the Queen’s gala dinner ) . The formula yields the expected number of new infections : R event ¼ ð kT = t Þð 1 (cid:0) e bt Þ Attendances at the pa - i - porta and Queen’s gala dinner events were used to estimate expected cases and compare them with observed cases . For the pa - i - porta event , the number of contacts was 85 for less than half the attendance time and 60 for more than half the attendance time , to obtain a similar number of observed and expected cases . For the Queen’s gala dinner the numbers of contacts were 20 for less than half the attendance time and 40 for more than half the attendance time . Considering that 9 and 11 cases of COVID - 19 ( Table 10 ) had the onset of symptoms the day of the pa - i - porta and the Queen’s gala dinner , respectively , the number of contacts k could be divided by 9 and 11 , and contacts could be 7 to 10 for pa - i - porta and 2 to 4 for the Queen’s gala dinner . These results could explain the spread of the epi - demic , and underline the importance of the duration of the event , the number of contacts , and the number of participants , which were much higher in the pa - i - porta than in the Queen’s gala dinner . However , a major limitation of this approach is the theoretical assumption of homoge - neous mixing of population in the epidemic [ 70 ] . In addition , asymptomatic or undiagnosed cases may bias the results and 67 cases were asymptomatic in our study . Table 9 .

The most frequent symptoms of COVID - 19 cases were weakness , fever , and lost smell or / and taste ; the severe course of the disease was less frequent in accordance with the average age of the patients [ 59 , 72 , 73 ] . In addition , the medical assistance was low and chronic illness was weakly associated with COVID - 19 , but cardiovascular diseases , hypertension , and hypothyroidism increased the risk of COVID - 19 , as indicated in some studies [ 74 , 75 ] . The presence of sequels remains low , but this is a new disease and follow - up of these patients would be useful . Considering the risk factors of COVID - 19 , higher age was associated with the disease , and children and adolescents were less affected [ 76 , 77 ] ; in contrast with other studies [ 78 ] , sex was not a risk factor . Young patients constituted asymptomatic cases , and their frequency was lower than in other studies [ 79 – 81 ] . The validity of self - reported lifestyle data has been consid - ered good [ 82 ] , and overweight and obesity were risk factors in line with population - based studies of COVID - 19 [ 83 , 84 ] . In addition , Merzon and co - authors [ 85 ] found that vitamin D deficiency was a risk factor of COVID - 19 infection and severity . Alcohol consumption was a marginal risk factor , but has not been found in some studies [ 86 , 87 ] . Upper and middle social classes were associated with the disease , in contrast with other studies [ 85 , 88 ] . Smoking is a controversial factor because it has been found to be both protective and a risk factor [ 85 – 87 , 89 , 90 ] . When observing the MGEs , it may be useful to consider that participation in the Falles festi - val was extensive , since the population of Borriana , both adults and children , took part in many cultural , touristic , leisure , and dinner events [ 35 ] , and many MGEs were held in Febru - ary and March 2020 . These MGEs may be considered as super - spreading events [ 91 , 92 ] . In this context , several points stand out . First , COVID - 19 cases began in January and February 2020 , with the onset of symptoms before the MGEs took place . Second , the pa - i - porta and the Queen’s gala dinner included dancing , which involved more contact among participants . In these MGEs the presence of participants with symptoms at the same dinner table was a signifi - cant risk factor of COVID - 19 , which is consistent with symptomatic cases being more conta - gious than asymptomatic cases [ 10 , 93 , 94 ] . Third , indoor MGEs had a high attendance , mainly in building A ; considering the building’s capacity and the close proximity among participants , a higher risk of transmission was found [ 3 , 95 , 96 ] . Attendance at the other MGEs was lower and full capacity was not reached . Fourth , several MGEs lasted for more than six hours and ended in the early morning . The average temperature in Borriana in March is 13 . 4˚C , and the average rel - ative humidity is 64 % [ 97 ] . These weather conditions have been shown to favor SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , estimated to range between 5˚ - 15˚C and 30 – 100 % of temperature and relative humidity , respectively [ 98 , 99 ] . Fifth , all the MGEs except the Valencia trip occurred in closed Table 10 .

Finally , airborne transmission [ 100 ] may be possible , and our results indicate one quadrant of building A with a lower incidence of COVID - 19 , but the two quadrants with the highest incidence were not the same in the two events , and these two quadrants were occupied by the Falles organizers and guests , who had attended the most MGEs . However , the presence of asymptomatic cases , the variability of the incubation period , and other potential transmission sources make it difficult to confirm this transmission in these MGEs . A potential causal relationship between MGE attendance and COVID - 19 may be consid - ered following the Austin Bradford - Hill criteria [ 101 ] ; aRR of MGE attendance ranged from moderate to high . It has been suggested that there is a biological plausibility of COVID - 19 transmission happening in closed places , where many participants gather in areas that are smaller than 1 . 83 m 2 per individual [ 102 ] . This is consistent with other COVID - 19 outbreaks in MGEs in several countries [ 21 , 24 , 42 , 103 , 104 ] . The temporal relationship between MGE attendance and COVID - 19 was established after the event . A dose - response relationship was demonstrated between MGE attendance , attendance time , and risk of the disease [ 105 ] . As an observational study , a retrospective cohort design could estimate the causality relationship more precisely than descriptive studies . The strengths of our study are as follows . First , it has a population - based design that allows a more integral approach to COVID - 19 . Second , a representative sample of a population exposed to MGEs was analyzed . Third , the response rate was high . Fourth , a serologic survey was carried out to confirm COVID - 19 cases [ 106 , 107 ] with a highly sensitive and specific technique . Fifth , statistical analysis was adjusted for potential confounding factors . Finally , the sensitivity analysis confirmed the previous results with an improvement in study precision . The study’s limitations are as follows . First , there was a period of time between exposure at the MGEs and the start of the study . In addition , the impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic could have caused some recall and misclassification biases . Second , only the Falles population was included in the study . Third , other MGEs were not studied , such as the Ninot parade , commu - nity dinners , children’s entertainments , and others that may have played a role in COVID - 19 transmission in Borriana . Fourth , an estimation of incubation periods was difficult considering the variety of MGE attendance . Fifth , no genetic studies were carried out into the SARS - CoV - 2 of positive PCR patients . Sixth , some residual biases may persist despite adjustments . Finally , as a new disease , COVID - 19 could have some factors that were not considered in the study . Some recommendations may be addressed based on the results of the study . First , and with immediate effect , MGEs should be considered as potential triggers of high transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . The maintenance , conservation , and inspection of the closed indoor building where these MGEs took place should also be strengthened . We must highlight that MEGs have continued to be held successfully with measures in place to prevent SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , suggesting that MGEs could be implemented again with specific prevention measures [ 108 – 112 ] . Second , COVID - 19 patients should be monitored to find out about this new disease and its evolution . Third , population - based studies , including serologic surveys , should be carried out to estimate the extent of COVID - 19 [ 113 , 114 ] . Finally , regarding our study , new lines of research could be implemented , including estimating other risk factors of COVID - 19 disease , determining serologic variations of antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 in the coming months , following - up patients and potential sequels , and exploring factors associated with the spread of the COVID - 19 pandemic [ 115 ] . As an epilogue to our study , we are carrying out a prospective cohort study with patients who tested positive for COVID - 19 , and a second sero - epidemiological study , started in Octo - ber 2020 , to research evolution , sequelae and antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 .
