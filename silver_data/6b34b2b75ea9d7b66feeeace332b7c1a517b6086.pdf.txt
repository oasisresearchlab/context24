Previous studies have demonstrated that Sema3a 2 / 2 mice have multiple developmental defects due to abnormal neuronal innervations 6 , 7 . Here we show in mice that Sema3A is abundantly expressed in bone , and cell - based assays showed that Sema3A affected osteoblast differentiation in a cell - autonomous fashion . Accordingly , Sema3a 2 / 2 mice had a low bone mass due to decreased bone formation . However , osteoblast - specificSema3A - deficientmice ( Sema3a col1 2 / 2 andSema3a osx 2 / 2 mice ) had normal bone mass , even though the expression of Sema3A in bone was substantially decreased . In contrast , mice lacking Sema3A inneurons ( Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 andSema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice ) hadlowbone mass , similar to Sema3a 2 / 2 mice , indicating that neuron - derived Sema3A is responsible for the observed bone abnormalities inde - pendentofthelocaleffectofSema3Ainbone . Indeed , thenumberof sensory innervations of trabecular bone was significantly decreased in Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 mice , whereas sympathetic innervations of trabecularbonewereunchanged . Moreover , ablatingsensorynerves decreased bone mass in wild - type mice , whereas it did not reduce the low bone mass in Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice further , supporting the essential role of the sensory nervous system in normal bone home - ostasis . Finally , neuronal abnormalities inSema3a 2 / 2 mice , such as olfactory development , were identified in Sema3a synasin 2 / 2 mice , demonstrating that neuron - derived Sema3A contributes to the abnormalneuraldevelopmentseeninSema3a 2 / 2 mice , andindicating that Sema3A produced in neurons regulates neural development in an autocrine manner . This study demonstrates that Sema3A regulates bone remodelling indirectly by modulating sensory nerve development , but not directly by acting on osteoblasts . Sema3A , the first member to be identified from the large sema - phorin family , is a well - known chemorepellent 1 , 2 , 5 . Sema3A , which is secreted from target tissue , forms steep gradients and causes the inhibition of axonal outgrowth and cell migration in a concentra - tion - dependent manner 4 , 5 . This repulsive signal is essential for neural development 3 . Indeed , Sema3a 2 / 2 mice have several neuronal defects , including abnormalities in the cerebral cortex , olfactory system and axon projections of dorsalroot ganglia ( DRG ) neurons 6 – 8 . More recently , Sema3A has been implicated in additional physiological functions , such as immunoregulation , angiogenesis and cancer development 5 , 9 – 12 . Osteoblasts and osteoclasts express semaphorin family proteins , and recent reports suggested that these proteins regulate bone remodelling locally by acting as paracrine signalling molecules 13 – 15 . To address the roleofSema3Ainboneremodelling , wefirstanalysedtheexpressionin bone of : Sema3a ; Nrp1 , encoding a Sema3A receptor ; and Plxna1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , encoding Sema3A co - receptors 1 . Sema3a was ubiquitously expressed in many tissues including bone ( Fig . 1a ) , indicating its diverse physiologicalaction . The expressionof Sema3a increasedduring osteoblast differentiation ( Fig . 1b ) and decreased during osteoclast differentiation ( Fig . 1c ) . Plxna1 , 2 and 3 and Nrp1 were expressed in osteoblasts ( Fig . 1dand SupplementaryFig . 1 ) , indicating that Sema3A may have a role in osteoblast differentiation . Therefore , we analysed Sema3a 2 / 2 mice . Sema3a 2 / 2 miceshoweda25 % decreaseinbonemass due to a decrease in bone formation without an overt change in bone resorptionat3 , 6and12monthsofage , althoughanon - significantincrease was observed in a serum bone resorption marker ( Fig . 1e – g and Sup - plementary Figs 2b , 3 ) , demonstrating that Sema3A accelerates bone formation . To determine whether the defect in bone formation in Sema3a 2 / 2 mice was cell autonomous , we isolated osteoblasts from wild - type and Sema3a 2 / 2 mice . In accordance with in vivo observations , Sema3a 2 / 2 osteoblasts showed a defect in differentiation , as observed * Theseauthorsequallycontributedtothiswork . 1 DepartmentofInternalMedicine , SchoolofMedicine , KeioUniversity , Shinanomachi35 , Shinjyuku - ku , Tokyo160 - 8582 , Japan . 2 DepartmentofOrthopedicSurgery , TokyoMedicalandDentalUniversity , Yushima1 - 5 - 45 , Bunkyo - ku , Tokyo113 - 8549 , Japan . 3 GlobalCenterofExcellence ( GCOE ) Program , InternationalResearchCenterforMolecularScienceinToothandBoneDiseases , Yushima1 - 5 - 45 , Bunkyo - ku , Tokyo113 - 8549 , Japan . 4 DepartmentofOralandMaxillofacialSurgery , SaitamaMedicalUniversity , Morohongo38 , Moroyama - machi , Iruma - gun , Saitama350 - 0495 , Japan . 5 Departmentof Physiology , SchoolofMedicine , KeioUniversity , Shinanomachi35 , Shinjyuku - ku , Tokyo160 - 8582 , Japan . 6 DivisionofDevelopmentalBiology , CincinnatiChildren’sHospitalMedicalCenter , Cincinnati , Ohio45229 , USA . 7 HardTissueGenomeResearchCenter , TokyoMedicalandDentalUniversity , Yushima1 - 5 - 45 , Bunkyo - ku , Tokyo113 - 8549 , Japan . 8 SectionofNephrology , Endocrinologyand Metabolism , DepartmentofInternalMedicine , SchoolofMedicine , KeioUniversity , Shinanomachi35 , Shinjyuku - ku , Tokyo160 - 8582 , Japan . a d 0 10 20 30 B V / T V ( % ) f b Sema3a B r a i n B r a i n O s t e b l a s t O s t ec l a s t H ea r t Lun g L i v e r I n t e s t i n e F a t B o n e m a rr o w B o n e D a y 0 D a y 1 D a y 3 D a y 0 D a y 1 D a y 3 Sema3a + / + Sema3a + / – Sema3a – / – 0 5 10 15 20 B V / T V ( % ) * * c e g Sema3a + / + S e m a 3 a + / + S e m a 3 a + / – S e m a 3 a – / – Sema3a – / – Sema3a + / – Sema3a + / + Sema3a + / – Sema3a – / – 0 2 4 6 N o .

Wenextdeterminedwhether treatment with Sema3A affected osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and proliferation . Sema3A accelerated osteoblastic differentiation when added exogenously in culture media ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . The knockdown of Sema3a in osteoblasts hampered their differentiation , andtreatmentwithSema3Arescuedthedefectsinosteoblastdifferentiationin Sema3a knocked - down osteoblasts ( Supplementary Fig . 2e ) . The expression of a dominant - negative form of Rac1 inhibited Sema3A - dependent osteoblast differentiation ( Supplementary Fig . 2f ) , which indicates that Sema3A regulates osteoblast differentiation through the activation of Rac1 , a signalling molecule required for the action of Sema3A on the collapse of the growth cone 16 . Sema3A treatment did not affect osteoblast proliferation ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . By contrast , the treatment of osteoclast precursors with Sema3A caused a decrease in osteoclast differentiation , as shown by a decrease in the number of multinucleatedTRAP - positiveosteoclastsandtheexpressionofosteoclast marker genes , such as cathepsin K ( Supplementary Fig . 2g ) . These results suggested that Sema3A functions in an autocrine fashion to stimulate osteoblastdifferentiationand inhibitosteoclast differentiation , thereby increasing bone mass . To determine whether Sema3A affected bone metabolism in an auto - crinemanner invivo , wegeneratedosteoblast - specificSema3A - deficient mice using a 1 ( I ) - Cre mice ( Sema3a col1 2 / 2 mice ) 17 . Sema3a col1 2 / 2 mice developed normally without any gross abnormality . The expression of Sema3a in the bones of Sema3 col1 2 / 2 mice was decreased ( Supplemen - taryFig . 5a ) , andtheosteoblastsisolatedfrom Sema3a col1 2 / 2 miceshowed adefectinosteoblastdifferentiation invitro ( SupplementaryFig . 5b , c ) , as observed for Sema3a 2 / 2 osteoblasts isolated from Sema3a 2 / 2 mice ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . However , Sema3a col1 2 / 2 mice had normal bone formation and bone mass ( Fig . 2a – c and Supplementary Fig . 5d ) . Moreover , another osteoblast - specific knockout mouse created using the osx - Cre mouse 18 , which deletes Sema3A in early osteoprogenitors , didnotdevelopanyboneabnormalities ( Sema3a osx 2 / 2 mice ) ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 5e ) . Taken together , these results indicate that the lack of Sema3A in osteoblasts is not the sole cause of bone abnormalities in Sema3a 2 / 2 mice . Bone remodelling has been shown to be regulated by the central and peripheralnervoussystems 19 . Thus , weexaminedthenecessityofneuron - derived Sema3A in the maintenance of normal bone mass by deleting Sema3A in neurons using synapsin - I - Cre mice 20 or nestin - Cre mice 21 ( Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice , respectively ) . Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice developed normally without any growth retardation or perinatal lethality , which were observed in Sema3a 2 / 2 mice 6 . Surprisingly , Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice showed significant reductions in bone mass in both males and females , in both vertebrae and long bones , and in both trabecular and cortical bones ; that is , in all of the bones in the entire body at any stages analysed ( Fig . 3b – d and Supplementary Figs 6 , 7b – d , f – h ) . This low bone mass phenotype was accompanied by decreased bone formation and osteo - blast differentiation in vivo ( Fig . 3d , e ) . Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 primary osteoblastsdidnotshowovertabnormalitiesinosteoblastdifferentiation in vitro ( Supplementary Fig . 8a , b ) , whereas Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 primary osteoblasts exhibited a defect ( Supplementary Fig . 8c , d ) , indicating a decreased differentiation state of the osteoblast precursors , some of which are known to be nestin positive 22 . Interestingly , expression of Sema3a inthebonesof Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 micewasdecreased ( Fig . 3a ) , suggesting that neurons in the bones are responsible for a substantial amount of Sema3A expression . Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice showed a decrease in bone mass ( Fig . 3b – d and Supplementary Figs 6a , b , 7b – d , f – h ) whereas Sema3a col1 2 / 2 mice had normal bone mass ( Fig . 2a – c and Supplementary Fig . 5d ) in the presence of compar - able decreases in the expression of Sema3a in bones in Sema3a col1 2 / 2 , Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice ( Fig . 3a and Supplemen - tary Figs 5a , 7a ) . This indicated that the decreased expression of Sema3a in bone was not the cause of the bone abnormality . In line with this observation , Sema3a 1 / 2 mice , in which the expression of Sema3a in bonewasdecreasedtoasimilarextenttoin Sema3a col1 2 / 2 , Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3A nestin 2 / 2 mice ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Figs 2a , 7a ) , had normal bone mass ( Fig . 1e , f ) . Because Sema3A is a well - known axon guidance molecule , espe - cially as a chemorepellent , we tested whether the development of the nervous system was affected in Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice . Surprisingly , nerve innervations were significantly decreased in the bones of both mice , as shown by a decrease in neurofilament - positive fibres ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Figs 9 , 10 ) . Dopamine b - hydroxylase ( DBH ) - positive sympathetic nerve fibres , which inhibit bone mass accrual 19 , were not significantly affected ( Fig . 4b and Sup - plementaryFig . 10 ) , andthesefibresdidnotcolocalizewithneurofilament - positivefibres ( SupplementaryFig . 11b ) . Neurofilament - positivefibres in bone are considered to be calcitonin - gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) - positive sensory fibres 23 , and indeed , CGRP - positive and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 ( TRPV1 ) - positive fibre innervations were decreased in Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and b 0 10 20 30 B V / T V ( % ) a 0 6 12 18 B V / T V ( % ) c 0 200 400 600 0 1 2 3 4 5 N o .

All rights reserved ©201 3 Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice ( Fig . 4candSupplementaryFigs 9c , 10 , 11a ) , and bothCGRP - andTRPV1 - postivefibreswerealsoneurofilamentpositive ( Supplementary Fig . 11b ) . In addition , the innervation of these fibres into cortical bone was also reduced ( Supplementary Fig . 11c ) , demon - strating that the projections of peripheral nerve fibres into bone tissue are uniformly decreased , in agreement with all of the bones being affected in Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice . To examine rigorously disturbances in nerve innervation in Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice , weperformedthree differentexperiments . First , Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice were intercrossed with Sox10 - Venus mice , which express Venus fluorescent protein under the controlofa Sox10 promoter 24 . Venus - positivesensorynerveinnervation was significantly decreased in Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . Second , the retrograde fluorescent tracer , Fluoro - Gold , wasinjectedintothebonemarrowof Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice , resulting in fewer neurons being labelled in the DRG ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . Last , sensory evaluation revealed that Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice were anaesthetic to all of the tested stimuli , indicating functional sensory deficits in these mice ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . Taken together , these results demonstrated the disruptionofnerveinnervationin Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice . Importantly , a longitudinal analysis showed that bone mass and nerve innervation into bone were decreased at all analysed time points in Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice ( that is , from embryo to 3 months old ; Figs 3b – d , 4a , c and Supplementary Figs 6a , b , 7b – d , f – h , 15 ) , which further indicated that bone mass accrual during development required normal nerve innervation into bone . We also confirmed that the projections of CGRP - positive sensory fibres into bone were similarly decreased in Sema3a 2 / 2 mice ( Fig . 4c ) , whereas DBH - positive sympathetic nerve fibres were unaffected ( Fig . 4b ) . By contrast , the projections of peripheral nerve fibres into bone tissues were not affected in Sema3a col1 2 / 2 , Sema3a osx 2 / 2 or Sema3a 1 / 2 mice ( Supplementary Fig . 16 ) , which had normal bone mass , indicating that the abnormal projections of sensory fibres , not the expression of Sema3A in bone , are responsible for the bone abnor - malities in Sema3a 2 / 2 , Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice . Toaddressformallythecausalrelationshipbetweenabnormalsensory developmentand lowbone mass , weintercrossed Sema3A - floxed mice withnestin - CreERTmice 25 expressingatamoxifen - inducibleCrerecom - binase under the control of a nestin promoter , and injected tamoxifen after birth to bypass the effect of Sema3A on sensory nervous system development ( Sema3a nestinERT 2 / 2 mice ) . Tamoxifen treatment did not significantly affect nerve innervation or bone mass accrual in Sema3a nestinERT 2 / 2 mice , which indicated that Sema3A expression during development before birth is essential for nerve innervation ( SupplementaryFig . 17 ) —aprerequisitefornormalbonemassaccrual . Second , wild - type mice treated with capsaicin lost bone mass and showed decreased sensory innervation 26 ( Supplementary Fig . 18 ) . However , Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice , which had diminished bone mass and sensory innervation in the absence of capsaicin treatment ( Supplementary Figs 7b – d , f – h , 9 , 11a ) , did not exhibit a further loss in bone mass with capsaicintreatment ( SupplementaryFig . 18 ) . Collectively , these results suggested that abnormal development of the sensory nervous system ordisruptionofthecapsaicin - sensitiveTRPV1 - positivesensorynerves led to low bone mass . Moreover , Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice also showed reduced bone regeneration and defective nerve innervation into newly synthesized bone after femoral bone marrow ablation ( Supplementary Fig . 19 ) , indicating that Sema3A also parti - cipated in bone modelling in adult mice via the modulation of nerve innervation . To investigate the role of the Sema3A signalling pathway in nerve innervation in bone , we analysed Plxna4 2 / 2 mice 27 . Plxna4 2 / 2 mice developed a low bone mass phenotype and showed decreased nerve innervation in bone ( Supplementary Fig . 20 ) , reminiscent of the Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 and Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 micephenotypes . Theseresults suggested that the Sema3A – Plxna4 pathway is important for nerve innervation in bone . Wenextdeterminedwhetherotherneuronalabnormalitiesin Sema3a 2 / 2 mice were also observed in Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 mice . The abnormal development of the olfactory system and spinal cord 6 , reduced thick - nessofthecerebralcortex 6 , andalteredpatternofsympatheticinnerva - tion in the heart 28 that are characteristics of Sema3a 2 / 2 mice were identified in Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 mice ( Supplementary Fig . 21 ) . These results suggested that , in vivo , neuron - derived Sema3A contributes to normal nervous system development ; that is , Sema3A works as an autocrine factor for neuronal development . We demonstrate that neuron - derived Sema3A regulates bone remodelling through the modulation of sensory nerve projections into bone . A potential direct action of Sema3A on osteoblasts has been suggested recently using global Sema3A knockout mice and a supra - physiological dose of Sema3A ( ref . 13 ) . However , given the absence of bone abnormalities in Sema3a col1 2 / 2 and Sema3a osx 2 / 2 mice , Sema3A must physiologically regulate bone metabolism primarily through the modulation of sensory nerve innervation , in vivo , although this does not rule out the possibility that osteoblast - derived Sema3A has a role in bone metabolism 13 . Although Sema3A has strong inhibitory effects on axonal elonga - tion in vitro when added exogenously 23 , we demonstrated that Sema3A , which is produced in neurons , is indispensable in the normal develop - ment of peripheral neurons in vivo . The co - expression of Npn1 and Sema3A in motor neurons regulates axon sensitivity to environmental Sema3Asources during motor axon pathfinding 29 . Given that Sema3A is expressed in DRG sensory nerves ( Supplementary Fig . 22 ) and that Sema3a synapsin 2 / 2 mice exhibit phenotypic similarities with Sema3a 2 / 2 mice ( SupplementaryFig . 21 ) , Sema3Aexpressioninneuronsmaybea fundamental component of proper neural development . Thisis , toourknowledge , thefirststudytodemonstratethatsensory nerves have an essential role in bone remodelling . The sympathetic nervous system is known to inhibit bone mass accrual , yet a ‘sensing’ systemisrequiredtoachieve bone homeostasis . Therefore , anintriguing question is whether any interaction exists between ‘osteo - anabolic’ afferent sensory nerves and ‘osteo - catabolic’ efferent sympathetic nerves .

Transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the a 1 ( I ) - collagen promoter ( col1 - Cre ) 17 , osterix promoter ( osx - Cre ) 18 , synapsin I promoter ( synapsin - I - Cre ) 20 and nestin promoter ( nestin - Cre ) 21 , were mated with floxed mice to obtain conditional knockout mice . nestin - CreERT mice were described previously 25 . For neonatal activation of CreERT , 83 . 5mgkg 2 1 tamoxifen ( Sigma ) incornoil ( Sigma ) wasintraperitoneally injected intolactatingmothersonceadayforfiveconsecutivedaysfromthedayofdelivery . Forhistologicalexperiments , corn - oil - treatedmicewereusedascontrols . At8weeks , mice were subjected to histological experiments . For capsaicin treatment , mice were deprived of drinking water for 6h before capsaicin injection to prevent pulmonary oedema . Capsaicin ( Sigma ) and vehicle ( 10 : 10 : 80 ( v / v ) of Tween - 80 , ethanol , saline ) werefreshlypreparedeachtime , capsaicinwassonicatedinvehicle until homogenously suspended , andmice were injected subcutaneously above the dorsal spine . Four - week - old mice received two rounds of capsaicin or vehicle treatment . Ineachround , mice receiveddailyinjectionsforthreeconsecutivedays ( 10mgkg 2 1 ondays1and2 , and15mgkg 2 1 onday3 ) , andeachroundwasseven days apart . At 8 weeks , mice were subjected tohistological experiments . Toobtain Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 ; Sox10 - Venus transgenic mice , Sema3a nestinf / 1 ; Sox10 - Venus mice 24 were mated with Sema3a f / f mice . Plxna4 2 / 2 mice were previously described 28 . Wemaintainedallthemice undera12hlight – darkcyclewith adlibitum access to regular food and water , unless specified . All animal experiments were per - formed with the approval of the Animal Study Committee of Keio university school of medicine and conformed to relevant guidelines and laws . Cell culture . In vitro primary osteoblast cultures were established as previously described 31 , 32 . Briefly , calvarial osteoblast cells were isolated from 4 - day - old mice byenzymaticdigestionin a - minimalessentialmedium ( a - MEM ) with0 . 5mgml 2 1 collagenase - P ( Roche ) and 0 . 05 % trypsin . For osteoblastic differentiation , cells ( 3 3 10 4 cellspercm 2 ) were culturedinosteogenicmedium ( 0 . 1mgml 2 1 ascorbic acid , 10mM b - glycerophosphate ) . Mediumwaschangedevery2days .

Immunohistochemistry . BonesweredirectlyembeddedintoOCTafterdissection . Brains and spinal cords were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in 0 . 1M phos - phate buffered saline ( PBS ) for 24h and dehydrated in 30 % sucrose in 0 . 1M PBS for48h . Brain , lumbarspinalcordandolfactorybulbsweredissectedandembedded in 1 . 5 % low - melting - temperature agarose ( BM Equipment ) in PBS . Brains were cut into 25 - m m - thick coronal sections using a cryostat and slices from every 150 m m were used . Lumbar spinal cords were cut into 25 - m m - thick axial sections . To characterize the expression of neuronal markers in the brain , series of sections from each experimental group were stained with neuronal markers . After treat - ment with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 for 5min , sections were blocked with 5 % NGS and incubatedwithmonoclonalantibodies , SMI31 ( amarkerforneurofilamentM 1 H , 1 : 500 , COVANCE ) , polyclonalantibodies , CGRP ( 1 : 800 , BioMol ) , TRPV1 ( 1 : 300 , Transgenic ) , tyrosinehydroxylase ( TH ) ( 1 : 500Chemicon ) , DBH ( 1 : 500Chemicon ) for 24h as previously described 35 . Primary antibodies were visualized with goat anti - mouse IgG Alexa - 594 ( 1 : 500 , Molecular Probes ) and goat anti - rabbit IgG Alexa - 488 ( 1 : 400 , Molecular Probes ) . For quantification of innervations of nerve fibres , the percentage of neurofila - ment - positive ( red ) area to the area corresponding to the secondary spongiosa of the right proximal tibial metaphyses was calculated by Image J software ( http : / / rsbweb . nih . gov / ij / ) . Retrogradelabellingoftibiaafferents . Toassesstibiaafferents , retrogradetracing withFluoro - Gold ( FG : Fluorochrome ) wasperformedinwild - typeand Sema3a nestin 2 / 2 mice . A total of 2 m l of 4 % FG was injected into the right tibial tuberosity with a Hamiltonsyringe . TheDRGsweretranscardiallyperfusedwithasolutionof4 % PFA in PBS 1 week after the FG injection and carefully dissected . The L3 and L4 DRGs were cut into 10 - m m - thick transverse sections perpendicular to the spinal nerve using a cryostat . The sections were incubated with NeuroTrace green fluorescent Nissl stain ( Invitrogen ) . Thenumbers ofFG - positiveneurons werecounted inthe section of middle portion of DRG . Sensory behavioural tests . The mice were placed in plexiglass boxes , which were 9 . 5 3 21 3 25cm in size , to become acclimated to the testing environment . These boxeswerethenplacedonanelevatedperforatedplasticsurfacefora minimumof 30min before all behavioural tests . A blind observer conducted the behavioural testing . In the tactile threshold test , mechanical sensitivity was measured by applying a series of calibrated von Frey filaments ( 0 . 02 – 8g ) to the plantar aspect of the hind paw . Eachfilamentwasappliedoncetoeachmouse . Beginningwiththe1gfilament , each filament was applied perpendicular to the hind paw for 4 – 6s . A brisk with - drawal of the hind paw indicated a positive response , and a lack of withdrawal indicateda negativeresponse . Thisfilamenttestingis repeateda maximum oftwo additional times , and a 2 / 3 response to the filament indicated an overall positive response . If the mouse demonstrated an overall positive response , the next lower force filament was applied as described above . In case an overall positive response wasnotobserved ( 0 / 3or1 / 3responses ) , thenextgreaterforcefilamentwasapplied as described above . Once the crossover threshold could be determined ( that is , RESEARCH LETTER Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved ©201 3 from response to no response , or vice versa ) , the responses to the next five fila - ments were recorded to determine the median withdrawal threshold . Response to acetone was tested using a plastic tube connected to a 1ml syringe and 100 m l of acetone was applied to the plantar surface of the foot without touching the skin . Acetone was applied five times to each paw at an interval of at least 30s , and the number of brisk foot withdrawals in response to the acetone application was recorded . Response to noxious heat stimulus was tested in the following manner . A responselatencytoanoxiousheatsourcewasmeasuredwithahotplateapparatus ( NISSIN , Japan ) . Mice were placed on a surface heated to 50 or 55 u C , and the amount of time between placement on the apparatus and a hindpaw lick or jump was recorded . To avoid tissue damage due to prolonged exposure to the heated surface , we used a cut - off time of 45s . Bonemarrowablation . Micewereanaesthetizedintraperitoneallywith400mgkg 2 1 trichloroacetaldehydemonohydrate ( ChloralHydrate ; WakoPureChemical ) . After removal of the hair from both hind limbs , thebone marrow of both femora on each animal wasablatedasdescribed previously 36 . Briefly , bilateral longitudinal incisions weremadeonthekneesofeachmousetoexposethefemoralcondylebydislocationofthepatella . Aholewasmadeattheintercondylarnotchofthefemurusingadental drill . A 0 . 6mm diameter Kirschner wire was inserted in the proximal end of the femur to confirm completion of marrow ablation by radiography . After removal of theKirschnerwire , thedislocatedpatellawasreposedandtheskinwassutured . Mice were killed at day 7 after ablation and bone histological analyses were performed . Insituhybridization . Spinal cords were fixed in 4 % PFA in PBS and dehydrated in 30 % sucrose in PBS . Frozen sections ( 20 m m ) were hybridizedwith digoxigenin ( DIG ) - labelled antisense riboprobes corresponding to a partial cDNA of mouse Sema3a ( 3 , 852 – 4 , 378bp ) at60 u Covernight . Fordetection , signalsweredeveloped usinganti - digoxigeninantibodyconjugatedwithalkalinephosphatase . Afteranti - body treatment , sections were incubated with NBT / BCIP ( Roche ) . Statistical analysis . We performed statistical analysis using Tukey – Kramer and Student’s t - test . Values were considered statistically significant at P , 0 . 05 .
