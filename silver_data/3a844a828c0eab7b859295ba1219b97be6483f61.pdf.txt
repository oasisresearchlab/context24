Rudge 1 , 2 Social mixing patterns are key determinants of infectious disease transmission . Mathematical models parameterised with empirical data from contact pattern surveys have played an important role in understanding epidemic dynamics and informing control strategies , including for SARS - CoV - 2 . However , there is a paucity of data on social mixing patterns in many settings . We conducted a community - based survey in Cambodia in 2012 to characterise mixing patterns and generate setting - specific contact matrices according to age and urban / rural populations . Data were collected using a diary - based approach from 2016 participants , selected by stratified random sampling . Contact patterns were highly age - assortative , with clear intergenerational mixing between household members . Both home and school were high - intensity contact settings , with 27 . 7 % of contacts occurring at home with non - household members . Social mixing patterns differed between rural and urban residents ; rural participants tended to have more intergenerational mixing , and a higher number of contacts outside of home , work or school . Participants had low spatial mobility , with 88 % of contacts occurring within 1 km of the participants’ homes . These data broaden the evidence - base on social mixing patterns in low and middle - income countries and Southeast Asia , and highlight within - country heterogeneities which may be important to consider when modelling the dynamics of pathogens transmitted via close contact . Infectious diseases spread via close contact exert a huge burden on health systems , local and global economies and societies . Mathematical models of infectious diseases have been used extensively to elucidate transmission dynamics , evaluate control strategies , and inform policy 1 . Central to these models are transmission parameters , including the effective contact rate between individuals or groups describing population mixing . Models of directly - transmitted pathogens commonly assume that transmission rates are proportional to the rate of contact between individuals , and often explicitly incorporate age - specific data on social mixing patterns 2 , 3 . Models allow - ing for heterogeneous contact rates between age groups have described age - specific infection rates for pathogens including influenza , pertussis and mumps 3 – 5 . In addition to the number of contacts , the intensity , duration , and location of contacts can also influence person - to - person transmission dynamics 6 . Consideration of social mixing patterns is crucial for models aiming to simulate the impact of non - pharma - ceutical interventions ( NPIs ) such as school and workplace closures , elderly shielding , and other social distancing measures 7 . This has been brought into sharp focus recently , as governments have implemented unprecedented measures as part of the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic response , often with guidance from models incorporating empiri - cal data on social mixing patterns 8 – 12 . Although patterns of mixing are critical determinants of infectious disease transmission , there is a lack of data on social mixing patterns in many countries 2 , 7 . The landmark POLYMOD project by Mossong et al . 13 surveyed , for the first time , contemporary mixing patterns in eight European countries . Using a contact diary approach , the study collected information on approximately 100 , 000 contacts of 7290 participants , including their age , duration , nature ( physical / non - physical ) , and setting 13 .

Since then , empirical contact data has been collected in a number of other geographical regions 14 – 18 . However , a 2019 systematic review of social contact surveys found that 80 % of studies were conducted in High Income Countries and , despite being the most populous continent , covered only five Asian countries 2 . Furthermore , only three studies included in the review examined differences between ( peri ) - urban and rural populations 16 , 19 , 20 . Demographic and social structures , socio - cultural norms , population mobility and occupa - tions vary substantially between ( and even within ) countries , and there is a need for surveys describing heterog - enous contact patterns in diverse regions 2 , 21 . To address geographical gaps in empirical data , ‘synthetic’ contact matrices have been projected for other countries using available demographic data until such data are available 7 . South - east Asia is recognised as hotspot for emergence and spread of infectious diseases , including those with pandemic potential . This is driven by factors such as increasing population sizes and mobility , coupled with environmental and land - use change including urbanisation , deforestation and intensification of livestock systems 22 . To contribute to the evidence - base on social mixing patterns in different contexts , here we present an in - depth analysis of data from a community - based contact survey in Cambodia conducted in 2012 . The study aimed to characterise mixing patterns and spatial mobility , generate setting - specific contact matrices between age - groups , and assess how these patterns may vary between urban and rural populations . Methods Study design and population . Data were collected through a cross - sectional survey in May 2012 , and employed a multi - stage , quota sampling strategy . In the first stage , three main study areas were purposefully selected to enhance geographic representativeness , whilst keeping the geographic scope logistically feasible . These study areas were : ( i ) Phnom Penh municipality ( the capital ) and surrounding Kandal province , located in south - central Cambodia , which informally comprise the Phnom Penh greater metropolitan area ; ( ii ) Kampot province ( south - west Cambodia ) ; and ( iii ) Kratie province ( east Cambodia ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Within each province , one rural and one urban district ( as designated by national census data ) were randomly selected . Three communes were then randomly selected from each study district . The total target sample size was 2016 people , aiming for equal numbers of rural and urban residents . The sampling strategy was further stratified to target equal ratios of study participants by study district , gender ( male and female ) and age - group ( using the age bands : 0 – 5 , 6 – 12 , 13 – 19 , 20 – 29 , 30 – 39 , 40 – 59 , 60 + ) , giving a sampling quota of 72 participants within each demographic ( age - gender - urban / rural ) stratum . This sampling strategy , along with the data collection tools described below , were designed based on those developed by the consortium of another project ( Social Mixing for Influenza - Like Illness in Asia ; PI : John Edmunds ) involving contact surveys in other Asian countries . Study participants were recruited through door - to - door household visits . Households were selected by pick - ing a random direction ( determined by spinning a pen ) from the approximate centre of each commune and Figure 1 . Map of the six study districts within Cambodia . Orange = urban , green = rural . ( 1 ) Chamka Morn , Phnom Penh municipality ; ( 2 ) Kandal Stung , Kandal Province ; ( 3 ) Krong Kracheh , Kratie Province ; ( 4 ) Snuol , Kratie Province ; ( 5 ) Krong Kampot , Kampot Province ; ( 6 ) Chhuk , Kampot Province . The borders of included provinces are marked with heavy black lines . Within each selected district , three sub - administrative divisions ( ‘sangkats’—urban ; ‘communes’—rural ) were randomly selected . 3 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) Scientific Reports | ( 2023 ) 13 : 5542 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 023 - 31485 - z www . nature . com / scientificreports / visiting each successive house in that direction . When someone was at home and consented to participate , a single household member was recruited , providing the consenting person was within a demographic stratum for which the quota had not been reached . Data collection . Upon recruitment , a background questionnaire was administered to collect data on demo - graphic and occupational variables , household structure and usual travel frequencies outside of their adminis - trative divisions . Social contact data were collected following similar methods used by Mossong et al . 13 . Partici - pants were prospectively allocated a 24 - h period in which they were instructed to remember all contacts they made beginning at 3 a . m . on the morning of the assigned day , where a ‘contact’ was defined as either “a two - way conversation in the physical presence of another person” or “physical skin - to - skin contact” . Participants were provided with a contact diary and encouraged to record every contact they made throughout their allocated day . An interviewer also led them through its completion the following day using a semi - structured series of prompts to aid recall . At both visits ( i . e . at recruitment and during the follow - up visit after the diary day ) , it was emphasised to study participants that they should try to capture all contacts within the contact diary . However , it was also acknowl - edged that some participants may have a large number of contacts , and / or “casual” contacts , which might result in underreporting of contacts in the contact diary . Therefore , after reviewing the diary with the participant , the interviewer also asked the participant whether they thought any contacts had been omitted in the diary . If so , participants were then asked to estimate the number of additional physical or non - physical contacts ( using the same definition described above ) in each of four age bands representing children ( 0 – 4 and 5 – 15 years ) , adults ( 16 – 64 years ) , and seniors ( aged 65 + ) . These additional contacts are henceforth referred to as ‘supplementary contacts’ , as opposed to ‘diary - reported contacts’ . Ethical approval . This study was approved by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ( LSHTM ) Institutional Review Board ( Ref : 6129 ) , and by the Cambodia Ministry of Health National Ethics Committee for Health Research ( Ref : 188 ) . All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guide - lines and regulations . Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants , or from a parent / guardian if the participant was under 18 years of age . Data analysis . Number and duration of contacts . All analyses were conducted using R 23 . Sampling weights generated by raking were applied to adjust the distribution of selected variables towards population levels ( Ta - ble S1 ; supplementary ) 24 . The following variables were used for weighting : urban / rural , age group , weekday / weekend , and employment status based on three levels : non - working age , employed , and unemployed , as de - fined by the Cambodian Socioeconomic Survey 2013 ( CSES ; National Institute of Statistics , 2013 ) . We estimated the effects of covariates of interest on the total number of contacts ( a participant’s “degree” ) and the total contact hours using multivariable negative binomial regression . Total contact hours were estimated by summing the contact durations across all contacts reported in the diary . Since duration of contact was reported in one of five ranges ( < 5 min , 5 – 14 min , 15 – 59 min , 1 – 4 h , or > 4 h ) , the mid - point of each range was used , right truncated at 4 h 18 , 25 . Analysis of total contact hours was restricted to diary - reported contacts , as contact duration was not collected for supplementary contacts . Age‑specific mixing . Age - structured mixing matrices were generated using five - year age bands from 0 to 64 years , and a single age band for participants aged 65 and over . Different matrices ( showing the mean number of contacts an individual in age group i made with an individual in age group j ) were generated for urban and rural participants in each of five settings : ( 1 ) at home with household members , ( 2 ) at home with non - household members , ( 3 ) at work , ( 4 ) at school or college , ( 5 ) on transport , during leisure time , or in other undefined settings . Household members were defined as “those which share a living space with the participant and use the same doorway exiting to a public space” . Only people for whom the address is their main residence were included . To observe the age - specific mixing patterns of high - intensity contacts , another set of matrices were generated for contacts that were either physical in nature , or ≥ 15 min in duration . Supplementary contacts were not included in the mixing matrices because the settings , and precise ages , were not collected for these contacts . All matrices were weighted using the variables described previously and were adjusted to account for the reciprocal nature of contacts 26 . That is , the total number of contacts that age group ( i ) made with age group ( j ) , should be equal to the total number of contacts age group ( j ) made with age group ( i ) . Mean contact rates were adjusted using Formula ( 1 ) where c ij or c ji is the mean contact rates between age groups , N i or N j is the population size of age group i and j , respectively . Population sizes were extracted from the Cambodian Socioeconomic Survey 2013 ( CSES ; National Institute of Statistics , 2013 ) . Comparison of reporting methods . To assess for potential bias in the reporting of contacts , comparisons were made between the age distributions , and intensity ( physical vs non - physical ) of contacts reported in the contact diary vs those reported as supplementary contacts . Comparisons were made using Pearson’s chi squared tests with 27 . ( 1 ) c ′ ij = 1 2 N i (cid:31) c ij N i + c ji N j (cid:30) , where c ij N i = c ji N j 4 Vol : .

Data were obtained from 2016 study participants in May 2012 , with equal target ratios achieved for each gender , age - group , and urban / rural locations ( Table S1 ) . The median age of surveyed participants was 24 years ( range : 4 days to 93 years ) , and 85 . 2 % of diaries were com - pleted on a weekday ( Mon – Fri ) . Among participants aged between 15 and 64 years , employment rates were lower than those reported in the Cambodian Socioeconomic Survey of the same year for urban areas ( 64 . 0 % vs . 86 . 1 % ) but comparable for rural areas ( 77 . 8 % vs . 79 . 6 % ) ( National Institute of Statistics , 2013 ) . Number and duration of contacts . A combined total of 59 , 597 ( diary and supplementary ) contacts were reported across all study participants , with half of these being recorded in the contact diary ( 29 , 358 ; 49 % ) . In total , this equated to a weighted median of 22 ( Interquartile range [ IQR ] : 13 – 40 ) contacts recorded per person day : 13 ( IQR : 8 – 20 ) diary - based contacts , and 7 ( IQR : 0 – 21 ) supplementary contacts ( Table S2 ) . Participant age , occupation , urban / rural residence , and day of the week the diary was completed , were all significantly associ - ated with the number of contacts made ( ANOVA p < 0 . 001 , Table 1 ) . Meanwhile , age , occupation , urban / rural designation , household size , and the number of rooms were significantly associated with total contact hours . The number and duration of contacts did not differ significantly between male and female participants . Fewer contacts were reported by people completing their contact diaries on weekends ; however , there was no significant difference in cumulative contact duration suggesting that on these days , people have fewer , but longer duration contacts . Apart from housewives or retirees , all occupational groups had significantly greater relative degree compared to the reference group of children at home . Shop workers / traders had approximately twice the number of contacts Table 1 .

Despite this wide variability , there was little difference in the total contact hours made by different occupational groups . Total contact hours were highest in pre - schoolers . Age - specific mixing . Age - assortative mixing ( i . e . , mixing between people of similar ages ) was apparent in both urban and rural populations , as shown by the central diagonal lines in the matrices which include contacts across all settings ( Fig . 2A , see Table S3 for numeric matrices ) . This was most pronounced in school - aged chil - dren ( 5 – 14 years ) . Older participants ( aged between around 35 and 64 years ) reported more contacts on average with younger people ( aged 5 – 34 ) , than was reported in the other direction ( Fig . 2A ) . This was particularly pro - nounced in rural locations ( Fig . 2A ) , and is consistent with the relatively young demographic structure in these locations , as with the country as a whole ( Fig . S5 ) . Most intergenerational mixing occurred at home between household members ( Fig . 2B ) , with the second set of parallel lines representing contacts between generations ( e . g . parent – child mixing ) . Contrastingly , contacts made at home with non - household members did not exhibit a clear intergenerational mixing structure ( Fig . 2C ) . At school , the expected strong age - assortative mixing was clear from the age of 5 to 19 years of age in rural locations , and from 5 to 24 years in urban locations ( Fig . 2E ) . Few contacts were reported on transport ( 0 . 3 % ) or during leisure time ( 0 . 2 % ) , so these data were combined with the contacts reported in ‘other’ ( unspecified ) settings for all analyses . In this combined matrix ( representing all contacts outside of home , school or work ) , age - assortative mixing was observed , although there was also substantial mixing across age groups , particularly in rural areas ( Fig . 2F ) . Setting of contacts . The majority of contacts ( 56 . 7 % ) occurred at home or in ‘other’ settings ( that is , other than home , work , or school ) ( 28 . 5 % ) ( Fig . 3A – E ) . Of note , over a quarter of all contacts ( 27 . 7 % ) occurred at home with non - household members . Children and young adults ( aged 5 – 19 years ) made approximately 20 % of their contacts at school / college , while those aged 20 – 24 made around 10 % of their contacts in this setting . The proportion of contacts made at home was highest for children ( 0 – 4 years ) , reached its lowest point at school age ( 5 – 19 ) , and had a general trend to increase with age thereafter ( Fig . 3A ) . Figure 2 . Contact matrices stratified by urban and rural ( participant residence locations , ( A – F ) , and by social setting ( B – F ) . Each cell in a given matrix shows the mean number of contacts made between two age groups . All matrices are weighted by day of the week ( weekday or weekend ) and employment status ( non - working age , employed , or unemployed ) . Matrices were further adjusted to account for recipricocity of contacts such that the total number of contacts that age group ( i ) made with age group ( j ) , were equal to the total number of contacts age group ( j ) made with age group ( i ) ( c ij N i = c ji N j ; where N is the population size of an age group ) . Home ( hh ) = contacts at home with household members ; Home ( non - hh ) = contacts at home with non - household members . Contact matrices which included only contacts that were physical or over 15 min in duration ( which accounted for 81 . 2 % of all diary - reported contacts ) exhibited the same patterns of age - specific mixing ( Fig . S1A – F ) . 6 Vol : .

Rural participants recorded a greater proportion of their contacts in ‘other’ settings compared with urban participants ( 37 % vs . 16 % ) , and a greater proportion of their home contacts with non - household members ( 53 % vs . 39 % of home con - tacts ; Fig . 3B ) . Though males and females reported no difference in quantity or cumulative duration of contacts ( Table 1 ) , the setting where these contacts took place differed , with males reporting more contacts at work and in ‘other’ settings compared to females who made more contacts at home with non - household members ( Fig . 3C ) . Relatively few contacts were reported at work ( Fig . 3A – E ) . Comparing occupational groups , only professional / office workers reported a reasonable proportion of their contacts ( 18 % ) in this setting ( Fig . 3E ) . Shop workers and traders reported over 75 % of their contacts as ‘Home’ either with household or non - household members . Intensity of contacts . Measures of contact intensity were in agreement : as contact duration increased , so too did the likelihood that a contact was physical in nature . Similar patterns were obseved for both of these meas - ures ( Fig . S2A ; χ 2 test for trend : χ 2 = 5036 . 9 , df = 1 , p < 0 . 001 , Fig . 4 ) . More regular contacts were also more likely to be physical ; ( Fig . S2B ; χ 2 = 1529 . 3 , df = 1 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Consistent with regression analysis , there was a general trend for decreasing proportion of physical contacts ( Fig . 4A ) and duration of contacts ( Fig . 4D ) with increasing age , up to age group 20 to 24 when this plateaus . The intensity of contacts also varied by setting , with contacts made at home with household members or at school / college more often longer duration , or physical . Contacts recorded in multiple settings were also high intensity owing to the fact that the majority ( 91 % ) of these contacts occurred at home ( in addition to other settings ) . While rural participants reported more contacts ( Table 1 ) , the contacts of urban participants tended to be of longer duration and were more likely to be physical ( Fig . 4C , F ) . Comparison of contact reporting methods . Under half ( 42 % ) of participants recorded all of their con - tacts in the contact diary , with the remainder reporting at least one supplementary contact . The number of reported contacts was right - skewed , especially so for supplementary contacts ( Fig . S3 ) . The age distributions of diary - reported contacts vs supplementary contacts differed ( χ 2 = 1563 . 1 , df = 3 , p < 0 . 001 ) with supplementary contacts more likely to be children ( 0 – 4 years ) and seniors ( 65 + years ) ( Fig . S4 ) . When comparing age - contact Figure 3 .

The majority of diary contacts ( 88 % ) occurred within 1 km from participants’ homes and only 2 % occurred more than 9 km away from their homes . Based on back - ground questions regarding usual travel frequencies , participants tended to remain fairly localised : 68 % and 45 % of rural and urban participants , respectively , reported having never left their province , while 98 % of rural and 89 % of urban residents reported never leaving the country . The oldest and youngest individuals tended to be the least mobile , and rural participants were less mobile than urban participants ( Fig . 5 ) . Discussion Here we present a large - scale , prospective social contact patterns study , the first of its kind to be conducted in Cambodia . We estimated that ( at least prior to the Covid - 19 pandemic ) the average Cambodian person had a mean of 31 . 2 ( median : 22 ; IQR : 13 – 40 ) social contacts per day . For comparison to other studies , this figure falls to 16 . 3 when counting only the contacts that were individually reported in the contact diary . The average number of self - reported diary contacts are similar to the Mossong et al . 13 European study ( 13 . 4 contacts per person per day ) and a study in a rural coastal population of Kenya ( 17 . 7 contacts per person per day 16 , but higher than other studies in Hong Kong , UK 17 and Zimbabwe 19 which reported an average of 7 to 8 . 1 contacts per person per day . Similar to our study , the study in Zimbabwe also asked participants to list ‘casual’ additional contacts with 64 % of people reporting fewer than additional 10 contacts per person per day . Such heterogeneities highlight the need for the collection of context - specific mixing patterns data , although the definition of contact used in the various studies and method of recording contacts will also play a role 18 . Consistent with studies in other settings , contacts in Cambodia were highly age - assortative ; this was par - ticularly evident in school - aged children but was also observed in other age - groups , such as young adults 13 , 16 , 28 . Patterns of intergenerational mixing were also evident in our contact matrices . Indeed , when compared with matrices from European countries 13 , intergenerational contacts in Cambodia appeared somewhat more sus - tained into adulthood , with some of the highest contact rates observed between older ( aged > 45 years ) and younger people ( ~ 15 – 30 years ) . We also observed notable rates of contact between older generations and young children ( e . g . representative of grandparent - grandchild mixing ) . This likely reflects the higher prevalence of multi - generational households in Cambodia , further supported by our data showing that these contacts tended to be reported at home with household members , particularly in rural areas . This has important implications for respiratory infections such as influenza and SARS - CoV - 2 , where younger individuals may have higher exposure rates due to their relatively high contact rates , and elderly individuals may be more susceptible severe disease 7 . Home and school are well documented as high - intensity contact settings important for infectious disease transmission 29 , 30 . Interventions aiming to reduce contact rates of vulnerable individuals ( such as elderly shielding ) may be more challenging to implement in LMICs given the household structures . Model simulations indicate that reducing contact rates among younger individuals in LMICs through school closures can have second - ary protective effects on older household members 31 . Conversely , concerns have also been raised surrounding potential adverse consequences of such measures , for example if children continue to mix with peers outside of school whilst increasing contact rates with their grandparents , or if there is health care worker absenteeism due to childcare responsibilities 32 , 33 . Except professional / office workers , all other occupational groups reported very few contacts at work . Shop workers and traders reported over 75 % of their contacts as ‘Home’ either with household or non - household members . Tentatively , this may be indicative of people selling goods from their houses . In future studies , asking participants to specify ‘other’ when collecting contact data would be useful in order to identify important setting - specific locations where contacts may occur . For example , a study in Peru found that a substantial proportion of contacts was made at the market or street which may be relevant here , particularly in rural areas 34 . Few , if any , previously published contact surveys have differentiated between household and non - household contacts when describing contacts taking place at home ( at least in their reported results ) . Notably , over a quar - ter of all diary contacts ( 27 . 7 % ) reported in our study occurred at home with non - household members . Given that reduction in rates of inter - household mixing has been a key component in the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic response , this may highlight a need for future contact surveys and modelling studies to consider heterogeneities in contact rates between household vs . non - household members at home . Contacts made in settings outside of home , work or school ( defined as “other” settings ) , also accounted for a substantial proportion of contacts , particularly in rural areas , lending support for the role of NPIs such as public space closures during periods of elevated transmission risk . A previous study by Prem et al . 7 combined contact data from the European POLYMOD survey with socio - demographic data with to project social contact matrices for 152 countries , including Cambodia . The overall patterns in our empirical contact matrices were broadly comparable to those in the synthetic , country - level matrices generated by Prem et al . 7 , although we observed a lower relative contribution of contacts in work set - tings than predicted . Moreover , we observed marked differences between rural and urban areas in terms of the number , intensity and settings of contacts . The higher number of contacts observed in rural areas , particularly in “other” settings , may initially seem counter - intuitive , given higher population densities in urban areas . How - ever , this might be explained by socio - cultural factors such as close - knit rural communities , particularly when considering our survey’s definition of a contact as a two - way conversation . Such factors may also be reflected in 9 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) Scientific Reports | ( 2023 ) 13 : 5542 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 023 - 31485 - z www . nature . com / scientificreports / higher observed rates of contact made across age groups with visitors at home . Meanwhile , the contacts of urban participants tended to be of higher intensity in terms of both duration and the proportion of contacts which were physical . Heterogeneities within and between countries highlight the importance of the collection of social mixing data from diverse regions 2 , 21 . However , the contact matrices may serve as valuable inputs for extrapolat - ing to other Southeast Asian countries where such data are not yet available , after appropriate adjustments have been made . Indeed , future studies , which are specifically designed to assess the validity of extrapolating contact survey data to other countries and regions , would be useful to inform considerations and limitations associated with such approaches . Relatively few previous studies have investigated differences in contact patterns between urban and rural populations . However , our findings are consistent with a study in Kenya , which reported higher contact rates in rural vs peri - urban participants 16 , while studies in Zimbabwe 35 and China 20 did not observe any significant differences . Recognizing that early outbreaks of SARS - CoV - 2 were mostly observed in cities with subsequent spread to rural areas , Prem et al . , ( 2021 ) recently updated their synthetic contact matrices to include custom contact matrices for rural and urban settings . The data analysed in our study were collected over 12 days in May 2012 , therefore temporal changes are not captured and changes in social mixing patterns may have occurred since that time , particularly following the emergence of the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic . However , given the lack of data from this region , and LMICs in general 2 , such data are still highly valuable . The POLYMOD data collected in 2005 / 2006 , and “synthetic” contact matrices based on these data , continue to be widely used in infectious disease transmission models , including those developed for SARS - CoV - 2 6 , 9 , 36 , 37 . Statistical approaches can be used to adjust for changing population demographics , and our results can also be used to inform and compare with future surveys to identify temporal trends . Selection bias may have occurred as we observed lower employment rates in our survey participants than has been reported in country census data as a whole . This is likely due to the recruitment via household visits , and future studies recruiting in a similar way may seek to avoid this during collection by having sampling quotas for this variable . We sought to correct for this in our analyses by using sampling weights for employment status ( along with other factors such as weekday vs weekend ) . Such weighting is useful , but care should be taken to avoid raking with too many variables with many levels , and ensuring sufficient data points with each cross - tabulation of these selected variables . This should help to avoid extreme sampling weights and minimise design effects 38 . Our study used paper - based contact diaries for self - reporting of contacts ; other studies have used online surveys , retrospective interviews , or made inferences regarding contacts through wearable devices 39 . Leung et al . 18 found that those with more years of education and higher income levels were more likely to choose online questionnaires , as opposed to paper based , when both were offered in a study in Hong Kong . They also found that participants using paper questionnaires reported a significantly greater number and duration of contact than those using online questionnaires 18 . Cambodia is classified as an LMIC and , according to the 2010 Demographic Health Survey ( DHS ) , only 19 % of rural residents had electricity ( compared to 90 % of urban residents ) , neces - sitating the use of household visits and paper - based questionnaires to reduce selection bias . Prospective surveys are preferred as they allow participants to remember more details of the contacts 2 , 40 . The use of an interviewer to retrospectively review and / or complete the contact diaries with participants through prompts enhanced completeness , and also inclusion , for example of illiterate participants ( estimated at 30 % of females in rural areas in 2012 ) 41 . However , while participants were asked to report all contacts within the diary , it is worth noting that less than half of our study participants believed their diaries to be complete when asked about this at the end of the interview ( participants were not given prior notice that this question would be asked ) . More contacts were recorded in the diaries ( median : 13 ) compared to supplementary ( median : 7 ) . It is difficult to compare these results with other settings as few previous studies have allowed reporting of additional contacts in this manner . Two previous studies did allow reporting of additional ‘casual contacts’ which did not meet the definition of a contact 28 , 42 . In Uganda , 87 % of participants reported casual contacts and 30 % of these reported 10 or more casual contacts 28 . In this study , participants reported a median of 7 . 2 non - casual contacts per person ( range 0 – 25 ) . In South Africa , a median of 14 ( IQR : 13 – 30 ) casual contacts were reported per person vs . 20 ( IQR : 13 – 29 ) close contacts 42 . It seems likely that many of the ‘supplementary’ ( non - diary ) contacts reported in this study would have been more casual in nature , and thus of lower epidemiological relevance . Indeed , a larger proportion of these supplementary contacts were non - physical contacts compared to contact - diary reported contacts . Furthermore , the age distributions of supplementary contacts were reasonably similar to those of the diary contacts ( to the extent that these could be compared ) , suggesting that truncation of the latter would not have biased the age - contact matrices to any substantial degree . The contact matrices ( Table S3 ) and other data presented here can be used to inform mathematical models of disease transmission in Cambodia . Indeed , the results from this survey were recently used to parameterise an age - structured Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Removed ( SEIR ) model of SARS - CoV - 2 , to conduct a scenario analysis of NPI strategies on transmission and healthcare resource capacities at country and province - level 43 , under work conducted for the WHO Western - Pacific Regional Office Covid - 19 modelling consortium . More broadly , the study also contributes towards addressing knowledge gaps on social - mixing patterns and population mobility in LMIC and Southeast Asian contexts , and provides empirical evidence on within - country variation between urban and rural areas .
