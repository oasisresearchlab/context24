In this work the interactions between a living cell and a nano - object , and in particular the effect on this of the adsorption of serum proteins , are directly examined by measuring the forces arising as an Atomic Force Microscope tip ( diameter 20 nm ) - simulating a nano - object - approaches and contacts a cell . We find that the presence of a serum protein corona on the tip strongly modifies the interaction as indicated by pronounced increase in the indentation , hysteresis and work of adhesion compared to a bare tip . Classically one expects an AFM tip interacting with a cell surface to be repelled due to cell elastic distortion , offset by tip - cell adhesion , and indeed such a model fits the bare - tip / cell interaction , in agreement with earlier work . However , the force plots obtained with serum - modified tips are very different , indicating that the cell is much more compliant to the approaching tip . The insights obtained in this work may promote better design of NPs for drug delivery and other nano - medical applications . Rapid progress has been made towards the incorporation of nanoparticles ( NPs ) in biological systems and nano - medicine , such as drug delivery systems , and diagnostic and therapeutic nano - tools 1 – 4 . At the same time , the small size of NPs , which make them attractive in such applications , is also a potential drawback , as they can travel along many pathways in the body and enter almost any tissue , cell or organelle 5 . In consequence , there have been extensive related studies of the cell / nano - material interface , both from applied and basic aspects , alongside the newly emerging field of nanotoxicology 1 , 6 – 8 . It is well known that as nanoparticles enter the body fluids they are coated by a protein corona 1 , 9 – 11 and hence the entity that the cell interacts with is not a bare nanoparticle , but rather a hybrid unit made of the protein corona and the coated particle . The corona’s composition and how it is related to the material and surface of the nanoparticle , the rate of association and dissociation and the lifetime of this coating were comprehensively assessed by Dawson and co - workers 12 – 16 . It is hypothesized that a particle decorated by a corona which contains proteins that are recognized by cell receptors may interact specifically with the cell and trigger an internalization process , while bare particles or particles coated by unrecognized proteins may interact differently 17 . Protein adsorption on a nanoparticle surface has been associated with facilitated uptake by cells for several different materials 18 , 19 , explained by entrance via multiple receptors enabled by the diverse protein composition of the serum 18 . However , due to the different corona compositions on NPs with different properties ( such as NP composition , size or shape ) , some studies demonstrate enhanced nanoparticle uptake for serum incubated NPs 18 – 21 , while other studies show the opposite 22 – 27 . The prevailing methodology in all the above mentioned studies of nanoparticle - cell interactions is incubation of cells with fluorescently labelled particles in the presence and absence of serum , following by evaluation of the particle uptake by methods of flow cytometry , and / or direct visualization of internalized particles by fluorescence / confocal and electron microscopy . Indeed , the question of cell - nanoparticle interaction has been addressed , so far , through investigation of the uptake process of specific particles 4 , 9 , 28 . However , the direct measurement of the actual forces between a living cell and a nano - object has been much less addressed 29 – 31 . The molecular force probe ( MFP ) , a device based on an AFM platform but optimized to measure forces , provides the capability to directly examine the interaction between a nano - object and a single cell . 1 Materials and Interfaces Department , Weizmann Institute of Science , Rehovot 76100 , Israel . 2 Department of Physical and Theoretical Chemistry , Oxford University , Oxford OX1 3QZ , United Kingdom . 3 University Laboratory of Physiology , Oxford University , Parks Road , Oxford OX1 3PT , United Kingdom .

In particular , we examine the effect on this interaction of exposing the nano - tip to serum , so that serum components may adsorb on it , relative to an identical nano - tip which had only been in contact with a medium containing no serum proteins . To minimize effects arising from the distortion of the cell as a whole by the tip , we used low forces ( in the range up to 100 pN ) at slow loading rates – far lower than in previous AFM studies of cells 32 – 34 . With such small forces , and using small tips with radii of about 20 nm , measurements are challenging as the interaction is very local and sensitive to any variation in local composition of the cell membrane or the pericellular matrix . In particular , at such scales local variations in the density of actin filaments and microtubules can affect the local mechanical properties . Fetal bovine serum , which contains more than 3000 different pro - teins 14 , was used as the environment for the cell and the interacting tip . As far as we know , this study is the first to examine directly the effect of the resulting corona ( which we attribute to proteins adsorbed from the serum , as observed earlier for free nanoparticles 13 , 35 , 36 ) on the forces between a nano - object ( the tip ) and a living cell . We probe the cell - nano - object interaction directly , therefore indirect effects of serum , such as its effect on aggregation and adhesion 37 do not interfere with our measurements . Results and Discussion Cell imaging and force measurements were carried out using a scanning force - probe device employing very sen - sitive commercially - available cantilevers . Force - separation cycles were carried out as described in Materials and Methods . Each force - separation curve was analysed to evaluate the amount of indentation , defined as the vertical distance the tip travelled from the contact point to the trigger point ; hysteresis , representing the dissipated energy ; and work of adhesion , as shown schematically in Fig . 1 ( and on an actual force curve in the supplementary infor - mation ( S2 ) ) . Two groups of experiments were carried out as follows : Group I : cells were cultured in complete medium ( ComM ) containing medium and serum ; however one hour before the experiment the ComM was replaced by medium ( M ) only ( containing no serum proteins ) . Group II : cells were cultured in ComM and one hour before the experiment the ComM was replaced by fresh ComM : In order to reveal what might happen to the tip once it is exposed to ComM in Group II , the tip was incubated for one hour in ComM at the same temperature as the meas - urements ( i . e . 37 ° C ) and then washed , dried and coated for further visualization by SEM . The qualitative differ - ence between a bare and a pre - incubated tip is demonstrated in dry - mode SEM micrographs presented in Fig . 2 , showing a corona adsorbed from the serum coating the tip apex together with deposited particles all over the tip surface . We note that while the adsorption takes place from the ComM , the SEM image is taken under dry con - ditions , implying that the shape of the imaged adsorbed species may differ somewhat from that in solution . The micrograph suggests – for example , the protruding layers on the pyramid edges and vertex - that the corona con - sists of an adsorbed multilayer rather than a monolayer . The size of the deposited particles – roughly 8 – 25 nm – is typical of serum proteins 38 or protein aggregates , and it is thus reasonable to attribute the corona on the tip to proteins adsorbed from the serum , as has been shown for free NPs in several studies 13 , 35 , 36 . It would be of interest to identify these tip - adsorbed proteins explicitly , as may be attempted in future work , though it should be noted that this is far from trivial . Not only is the adsorbance on a single nano - tip minute , but separating tip - adsorbed proteins from those adsorbed on the much larger cantilever to which the tip is attached , which is also immersed in the ComM but which is made from a different material , is especially challenging . Changing the solution one hour before the measurements enabled the cells to stabilize to any changed medium composition ; use of fresh medium also ensured that the dish was as free as possible of floating bio - material that might stick to the tip and alter the force measurements . Prior to force measurements the cells were imaged in order to pick the location at which the force meas - urements were to be subsequently acquired . The cell imaging also ensured that the chosen cell was indeed well adhered to the petri dish and healthy in appearance . To avoid the possibility that the underlying substrate was affecting the measurement , only high points were chosen for the subsequent force measurements . As we aimed to probe the interaction between the AFM tip and the cell rather than the mechanical properties of the cell , the applied load both during the scanning and the force measurements was kept as low as 100 pN , which is only about 10 - fold larger than the amplitude of the noise ( ca . ± 7 – 8 pN ) in the force - distance profiles . The very soft cantile - ver chosen for this required application of low - load contact mode ( CM ) , for the cell imaging , as opposed to the frequently - used tapping mode 39 or regular CM where much higher forces ( 2 – 5 nN ) are applied 34 , 40 , 41 . However , in Figure 1 . Schematic force profile and the retrieved adhesion , hysteresis and indentation parameters . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 45758 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep45758 contrast to regular CM - imaging that might injure the cells 42 , the low - force CM imaging suppresses cell damage and yet provides high resolution , as was earlier demonstrated by Campbell 43 and Le Grimellec 44 , 45 . A typical OA ( outer annulus ) cell imaged by low - force CM is presented in Figure S1 in the supporting information . A typical force profile measured in medium without proteins ( i . e . a bare tip , Group I ) is presented in Fig . 3 . The force curve taken at a high point as can be seen in the cross section ( 3c ) ( taken along the red line in Fig . 3a ) is characterized by a relatively large indentation ( ~ 300 nm ) with no indication of membrane penetration and a small hysteresis between the approach and the retraction curves ( red curves in Fig . 3d , taken at the red point in Fig . 3a . This is in contrast with force profiles measured at low points on the cell where the substrate is already felt ( not shown ) or on the bare substrate ( such as petri dish - crossed circle on the surface , Fig . 3a ) , black curve in Fig . 3d . In this case the indentation is significantly smaller with a linear increase in the force in the contact regime and no hysteresis is observed , as expected from a force profile measured against a hard surface . The clear difference between the two groups is highlighted in Fig . 4 . Figure 4 ( a ) shows a representative force profile of each group over a similar range of normal loading ( roughly 100 pN ) . Figure 4 ( b ) shows the most prob - able force curve plot for each of the groups , as is explained below , based on analysis of 100 plots for group I , and 170 plots for group II ( including many different contact points and several different cells for each group ) . The variation in the obtained force profiles for each of the groups was relatively large . This variation results from imprecise positioning of the tip at the highest point on the cell as a result of thermal drift in the instrument , as well as from natural diversity between the live cells , and cellular movement during the experiment . In particular the cytoskeleton morphology varies over the scale of tens of nm which is the lateral extent of the tip - cell inter - action on initial contact 46 . The large variation can be seen in Fig . 5 , which shows the probability distribution of the modulus values for group I ( bare tip contacting the cell ; the values were extracted from the plots as discussed below ) . A similar variation in AFM - tip / cell interaction was previously reported and attributed to similar factors 30 . Our analysis focuses on comparing these two cases , group I ( bare tip in serum - free medium ) and group II ( corona - coated tip in complete medium including serum ) . Figure 4a , where representative profiles of the two groups are shown , clearly demonstrates that all three measurable parameters , namely , range of indentation , extent of hysteresis and work of adhesion are significantly smaller in Group I experiments ( absence of serum proteins , black profile and associated cartoon ) relative to Group II measurements ( serum proteins present , see cartoon ) . In Fig . 4b are shown the approach curves based on fitting ( as described below ) and averaging all profiles within each group ( taking the mode rather than the mean , due to the skewness of the modulus distribution , see SI ) . These prominent differences between the two cases , with and without serum addition , are very clear above any Figure 2 .

We emphasize that the presence of serum coating on the tip in itself does not account for the large differences between the two groups , as can be clearly seen in the control plot obtained for a serum - corona coated tip pressing on a petri - dish bare surface , shown in green . In this control plot no hysteresis is observed . As a typical reference petri - dish curve for Group I is shown in Fig . 3d , we do not include it again in Fig . 4a for clarity . How can we interpret the large differences in these force data plots ? The mechanical behaviour of the cell upon deformation by the AFM tip can be understood as follows : indentation of a live cell induces deformations in the cell membrane and cytoskeleton . During indentation , the membrane suffers stretching and bending defor - mations . As the membrane itself is not smooth and tense , it may stretch under the AFM tip without exhibiting a noticeable elastic force 30 . The force required to bend the membrane may also be neglected due to its low bending rigidity 30 , 47 . We are then left with the elastic deformation of the cytoskeleton , and any adhesion effects ( arising from chemical affinity between the tip and the membrane ) . It is well established that the elastic response of cells to indentation is mostly due to the cytoskeletal actin network 48 . The membrane may , however , experience an adhesive attraction to the AFM tip indenting it . If we assume that the indenter - cell contact area and the associated adhesion energy increase progressively during the indentation ( as the indenter has a pyramidal shape , see Fig . 2 and schematic inset to Fig . 4A ) , then the externally applied force F ( x ) that is required to indent a cell ( in the x direction ) is generally determined by a combination of an elastic force exerted by the cell cytoskeleton and an adhesive force due to cell - membrane / AFM - tip adhesion . A detailed model has been derived by Sirghi et al . 30 for the indentation of a soft , adhesive material with a pyramidal indenter : α π π γ α π α = − ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⁎ F x E x x ( ) 4 tan 32 tan cos ( 1 ) a 2 2 Here E * is the indenter / sample reduced Young’s modulus ( for indenters much stiffer then the sample , E * = E / ( 1 − v 2 ) where E is the Young modulus of elasticity and the Poisson ratio , v , is considered to be 0 . 5 for cells ) , α = 35 ° is the pyramid angle of the AFM tip and γ a is the adhesion energy 30 . The model described above can readily be used to fit our data . Fitting to the Group I data , bare AFM tip in serum - free medium , is done automatically with a custom written Matlab code for all 100 separate Group I profiles ( SI ) , and from the best fit we extract the values of the modulus and adhesion energy . The probability distribution of the modulus values for group I is shown in Fig . 5 ( and is seen to be skewed , as noted earlier ) . We find maximum probability values of E * = 1 . 3 kPa , and γ a = 5 . 6·10 − 5 J · m − 2 , very comparable to previously reported values 30 ( that were obtained for a different cell type ) . The average modulus of a cell depends on the particular cell type . While the modulus value can vary locally when the cell is probed with a sharp tip , the average value taken over many cells and many contact points should be similar and constant , within the scatter , for that given cell type . As the modulus is an internal cellular property that depends largely on the cytoskeleton structure , it should not be affected by tip coating such as the serum protein corona . As all cells were cultured under identical conditions , those incubated in serum and those without serum during the measurements should have the same overall modulus ; indeed , it has been shown 49 that the presence or absence or serum proteins does not affect the overall cell modulus over periods shorter than 3 days . We thus extracted the effective modulus E * = 1 . 3 kPa of our cells from the Group I results as noted above , and attempted to use this value for fitting the data of group II , as it appears in Fig . 3 ( B ) , to Eq . 1 with a single fitting parameter γ a ( we substitute a value E * = 1 . 3 kPa into Equation ( 1 ) . ) However , there is no value of the adhesion energy which , taken together with this cell modulus , can fit the observed force profiles . This implies that the picture suggested in the inset to Fig . 3 ( A ) and the corresponding Eq . ( 1 ) , cannot represent what is happening when proteins are present both on the tip as well as in the surrounding medium . Moreover , we have compared values of : 1 . average indentation 2 . amount of hysteresis and 3 . work of adhesion . These average results ( based on over a hundred profiles , Materials and Methods ) are presented as histograms in Fig . 6 , and in Table S1 in the SI . Comparing groups I and II , the average values of the three parameters are clearly very different , differences which remain highly significant even when the scatter is accounted for ( p < 0 . 001 in the Kruskal - Wallis test , see also Materials and Methods ) . While the average indentation , amount of hysteresis and the work of adhesion measured Figure 5 . Histogram of Group I elasticity modulus values , showing the skewed ( rather than Gaussian ) distribution of values . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 6 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 45758 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep45758 in group II are 1179 nm and 7 . 96 × 10 − 18 J and 6 . 18 × 10 − 17 J respectively , the values for Group I are about 3 – 4 times smaller . The variance of the results is considered in more detail in SI . The results of all three parameters thus indicate consistently that the presence of serum proteins completely alters the tip - cell interaction . How can all these observations on Group II ( where the tip is exposed to serum and its corona is attributed to proteins adsorbed from the serum 13 , 35 , 36 , as discussed earlier ) , namely the incompatibility with the model of Eq . ( 1 ) , and the very large indentation , hysteresis and adhesion ( relative to Group I where the tip is bare ) , be explained ? As the protein - decorated tip contacts and indents the cell , the cell undergoes a strikingly - large defor - mation with little resistance . That is , the tip continuously presses on the cell without reaching the trigger force , which is only reached after a deep indentation . We stress the difference in the length - scales of the indentations involved - of order of a micron for group II rather than of order of 200 nm for group I . We attribute this as follows : Since , as earlier noted , the effective cell elasticity as a whole ( essentially its modulus E * ) is due to the cytoskeleton and is unaffected by the corona , one would expect a large elastic resistance F elastic to such a deformation ( to depth x ) of the cell . If we assume that the modulus E * is unchanged with extent of indentation 50 we may approximate this by taking just the first term in Eq . ( 1 ) which dominates at such large indentations since it varies as x 2 while the offsetting adhesion term varies as x . For a deformation x = 1 μ m , this yields an expected resistance force F elastic = α π π ⁎ x E 4 tan 2 ≈ 6 . 5 × 10 − 10 N . From Fig . 3 ( B ) however , the actual force F required for a penetration of 1 μ m is only ca . 0 . 4 × 10 − 10 N . The difference between the force F elastic required for a 1 μ m deformation of the cell and the actual force needed for such a penetration by the corona - coated tip is thus ca . 6 × 10 − 10 N . In other words , an attraction between the tip and the cell of that magnitude ( ca . 6 × 10 − 10 N ) must have occurred to offset the repul - sion that would have been expected from the elastic deformation for such an indentation . We attribute this attrac - tion to the engulfment by the cell membrane of the ( corona - coated ) AFM tip , and / or the beginning of formation of a pit which is associated with a large local change and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton as happens in several endocytosis mechanisms . e . g . Caveole or Clatherin mediated endocytosis 51 , 52 . This is illustrated schematically in Fig . 7 . Clearly complete endocytosis ( as would be the case for a small NP 31 ) cannot occur , since the AFM tip – whose footprint on the cell surface increases progressively as it indents the cell – cannot be ‘swallowed up’ by the cell . The above observations obtained from the load curves that show a striking difference in the tip - cell inter - actions between the two groups are in line with the results of the work of adhesion derived from the unloading curves , as summarized in Fig . 6c . Long - ranged pull - off forces resulting in a large work of adhesion as demon - strated in Fig . 4 ( pink curve ) are related to bonding events such as tethering of receptors to ligands , and clamping of a trans - membranal protein or any other biomacromolecule by the tip 53 , 54 . In addition , simple nonspecific adhe - sion arising from van der Waals interaction may be playing a minor role . Multi jump - out peaks in a “sawtooth” pattern observed in the unload curves indicate serial rupture of specific bonds or unfolding of macromolecules before full separation between the tip and the cell is retrieved . The rupture force , as observed in the unloading curves , is several tens of pN which is in agreement with specific ligand - receptor data given in the literature 55 , 56 . The probability of these processes increases dramatically in a ComM environment ( Group II ) due to the presence of many proteins which may bridge the tip to the cell surface . Based on the above , the frequency of the appearance of multi - peaks pattern during the retraction of the tip is expected to be much higher in Group II . This is indeed the case as explicitly shown in Fig . 8 . Additionally , the large adhesion shown in Group II is consistent with the large indentation since , on geometrical grounds , the contact area of the tip with the cell surface varies as the square of the indentation enabling the formation of additional specific bonds . Moreover , due to the large inden - tation the tip spends a longer time in contact with the cell , which allows the formation of these specific bonds contributing to the increase in work of adhesion . We note that the only other AFM study we know of that com - pared surface - cell interactions in serum containing and serum free media utilized much larger , colloidal probes , Figure 6 .

The data are presented as mean ± standard error . The results presented for each groups are based on a 100 or more independent force profiles per group ( Materials and Methods ) . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 7 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 45758 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep45758 of 8 – 10 μ m diameter and demonstrated a twofold increase in the adhesion force between microspheres and cells in the presence of serum 57 . The interactions measured in this study , particularly as the corona - coated nano - tip makes initial contact with the cell , deforms the cell membrane and indents the cell , are attributed to offset of the elastic deformation force by attraction arising from cell - membrane engulfment of the indenting tip , and are thus related to nanoparticle endocytosis . We may then ask : why do we not observe any net attractive forces on approach , but only upon sepa - ration ? A clue to this is provided by a recent study of endocytic forces on gold NPs 31 Here the attractive endocytic forces on a 20 nm - diameter NP do not exceed ca . 10 pN until the NP has been invaginated into the cell by about 10 – 15 nm . In the case of our 20 nm - diameter AFM tip , this would suggest that on initial contact and tip indenta - tion of the cell surface by a comparable amount , the endocytic attraction on it would also be of that magnitude , ca . 10 pN ( precise comparisons may not be warranted because of differences in NP / tip material and cell types in the two studies ) . This is within the noise level of our indentation vs . force traces ( ca . 10 pN , see force profiles in Figs 3 and 4A ) . At higher indentation of the cell surface , we believe that the elastic repulsion arising from further cell distortion swamps the initial endocytic attraction , and increasing subsequent indentation proceeds as dis - cussed earlier , with attraction due to engulfment of the corona - coated tip largely offsetting the repulsion due to cell distortion . Figure 7 . A schematic representation of the engulfment mechanism which results in the differences between indentation by a bare tip , left , and a corona – coated tip , right . For the bare tip the elastic forces ( due to deformation of the cytoskeleton elements , shown as black lines ) act together with weak forces arising from the membrane adhering to the tip , left . For the corona coated tip , right , its engulfment by the cell membrane results in a substantial attractive force arising from corona - membrane recognition – specific interactions are schematically indicated - which largely offsets the elastic repulsion due to deformation of the cytoskeleton . Figure 8 . The probability of the formation of specific bonds increases in the presence of free proteins in the medium . This is shown by the frequency of the appearance of multi jump - out peaks pattern describing specific rupture and unfolding events during the retraction curves in Group I measured in M ( grey ) and Group II measured in ComM ( black ) . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 8 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 45758 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep45758 A final point concerns the possible variation of composition of the corona on the AFM tip ( attributed to adsorbed serum proteins 13 , 35 , 36 ) with time of exposure to the serum . As considered in earlier studies of serum pro - tein adsorption on NPs 35 , 58 , this composition may change with time due to the competition between protein con - centration and the on / off rates for adsorption of different serum proteins . In our study the force - distance profiles were taken after the AFM tips were exposed to serum for different times , as a single run in which several cells and contact points were measured could take up to three hours . If indeed the corona composition was changing in this time and so resulting in somewhat different cell - tip forces , this may account for some of the scatter in our profiles . In summary , we have examined directly the force between a nano - object – an AFM tip with a 20 nm extremity radius – and a living cell , both between a bare tip in serum - free medium , and also in the presence of a protein corona adsorbed onto the tip from serum in the surrounding medium ( and attributed to adsorbed serum pro - teins 13 , 35 , 36 ) . This emulates the corona that rapidly coats all NPs entering the body before they enter into cells by endocytosis . Our results show that as the bare tip progressively indents the surface , its interactions are dominated by a repulsion arising from the distortion of the cell , with an effective modulus ( and membrane adhesive energy ) similar to earlier studies . In striking contrast , when the corona - coated tip indents the cell surface it experiences a strong attraction which offsets most of the repulsion due to the cell distortion , resulting in a much more com - pliant behaviour , where a given force on the tip leads to a much larger cell indentation , adhesion and hysteresis relative to the bare tip . We attribute this attraction of the corona - coated tip to partial engulfment of the tip by the cell membrane , a process driven by the recognition of the membrane by the serum - protein corona , and akin to the initial stages of endocytosis . This study , despite utilizing an AFM tip and not a nano - particle , advances the understanding of the effect of corona - driven forces on NP uptake . It demonstrates unambiguously that examin - ing cells in the absence of serum or interstitial fluids , does not provide physiologically relevant information on membrane - nanoparticle interactions . Understanding how nanoparticles interact with cells is important for the design of nanoparticles for biological applications , such as nano medicine . Thus , modifying nano - tip surfaces so as to reduce or increase the ‘softness’ of their interactions with living cell surfaces , as in the present study , may reflect directly on the cellular uptake of similarly surface - modified nanoparticles in living organisms .

Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) . Instrument and Measurements . Cell imaging and force measurements were carried out with a MFP - 3D SA ( AFM ) instrument ( Asylum Research , Santa Barbara , CA ) . Both scanning in contact mode ( CM ) and force measurements were done using a silicon nitride V - shaped 200 μ m long cantilever having a nominal spring constant of 0 . 02 N / m with a pyramidal silicon nitride tip and a nominal tip diameter 20 nm ( TR400 , Olympus ) . Prior to each experiment the cantilever spring constant was determined accurately . This was done by immersing the tip into a petri dish with the appropriate medium at 37 °C , recording force plots for calibration of the optical lever sensitivity and then the spring constant was obtained by applying the thermal method 60 ( see SI ) . Throughout all the experiments the temperature was controlled and measured by a commercially available accessory , Petri Dish Holder and Heater from Asylum Research with 0 . 05 °C accuracy as stated by the manufacturer . The chip and the chip holder were irradiated in a UV - Ozone device prior to use . A full force profile / cycle consisted of a compression curve , collecting the change in the cantilever deflection as the tip moved towards the cell , until it reached a predetermined load ( refers as trigger - mode force measurement ) and a decompression curve monitoring the deflection change as the tip moved away from the cell until it was fully retrieved . Several points on each cell were measured , with several repeated measurements at each spot . The approach velocity was 750 nm / s and the pre - determined loading force ( trigger point ) was about 100 pN . As a control prior to each cell indentation , a force curve on a bare petri - dish surface was obtained for reference , for each of the measurements performed . AFM sample preparation . The cells were seeded and cultured in an uncoated 60 mm petri dish for 5 – 10 days and used before reaching confluence . The dish was directly transferred from the incubator to a 37 °C preheated petri dish holder mounted on the AFM base / stage ( see SI ) . Data analysis . The raw data of force measurements collecting the deflection of the cantilever versus the z - piezo displacement were converted to force versus separation according to well - known procedures 61 , 62 ( see SI ) . Each force - separation curve was analyzed to evaluate the amount of indentation , hysteresis and work of adhesion as shown schematically in Fig . 1 . An actual plot that was automatically analysed by our custom written software is shown in supplementary figure S2 . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 9 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 45758 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep45758 Statistical analysis . Due to the intra - cell variation the trigger - mode force profiles were repeated 15 – 20 times for each cell . In each group 5 – 9 cells were examined ; however we tested no more than 2 – 3 cells per dish in order to limit the time the cells remained on the AFM stage . A special algorithm written in Pyton was used to calculate all the measurable variables for each of the curves i . e . indentation , hysteresis and work of adhesion . Any abnormal curve or value was discarded . The averages , standard deviation and standard error were calculated for each group and each measurable variable . The data were tested for statistical significance difference in order to evaluate if the presence of serum proteins have an effect on the measurable parameters . First , the data were tested for homogeneity of variances between the groups using Bartlett’s test . The results showed that variance within all three parameters varied significantly across the different groups ( p < 0 . 0001 , i . e . the null hypothesis of equal variances was rejected ) . Second , based on the Bartlett’s test results , the Kruskal - Wallis test was applied to determine if there is a statistically significant differ - ence between the three groups . In all tests a significance level of α = 0 . 05 was chosen . In addition the co - variance ( COV ) for each variable of each group and within one cell ( intra - cell COV ) was calculated . Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM ) . AFM tips images were obtained using a field emission Ultra 55 high resolution scanning electrons microscope at acceleration voltage of 3 kV and a sample - to - detector distance of 4 mm . The serum - proteins incubated tips were immersed for one hour in serum containing medium , washed and dried by nitrogen flow and then coated with two thin Chromium layers of 2 and 3 nm at two directions . The bare tip remained uncoated . As a separate control to ensure the Chromium - coating was not introducing artefac - tual structures on the tip , SEM micrographs of Chromium - coated bare tips were obtained and showed them to be identical to the non - Chromium - coated bare tips .
