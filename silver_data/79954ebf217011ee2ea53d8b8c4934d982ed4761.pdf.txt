Between amino acids 1460 and 1483 , there is a single tyrosine residue at position 1477 , with acidic amino acids to the N - terminal side of it and a leucine residue three positions C - terminal to it ( Figure 6B ) .

The target site for CHC phosphorylation by pp60 c - src is generally thought to be an assembly control region ( Na¨thke et al . , 1992 ) . was then mapped in vitro and in vivo ( Figure 6 ) .

These man CHC ( Nomura et al . , 1994 ) . An epitope tag , from T7 phage ( Lutz - Freyermuth et al . , 1990 ) , was added for observations indicate that the target for CHC tyrosine phosphorylation is in the CHC hub domain . Accordingly , expression at the N terminus of the mutant . As a control , the wild - type human CHC was similarly epitope tagged , pp60 c - src did not phosphorylate the N - terminal domain of CHC ( residues 1 – 545 ) when tested against bacterially so that the fate of wild - type and mutant transfected clathrin could be analyzed . Both constructs were inde - expressed recombinant fragments of bovine CHC ( Liu et al . , 1995 ) ( Figure 6A ) . The pattern of phosphorylation pendentlytransfectedintoA431cells , andstableclones , Clathrin Phosphorylation in EGF Endocytosis 681 expressing the constructs at a low level , were isolated . Low - level expression was favored intentionally by our transfection strategy , so that expression of the mutant CHC would not result in dominant - negative inhibition of clathrin function . Morphological analysis of transfec - tants expressing the wild - type or mutant CHC , by stain - ing with anti - T7 mAb , revealed a very weak but normal punctate clathrin staining pattern for the transfected CHCs ( data not shown ) , indicating that they were in - corporated into endogenous clathrin - coated vesicles . Transfectants were stimulated with EGF , and the epi - tope - tagged Y1477F CHC and wild - type CHC were im - munoprecipitated with anti - T7 mAb . Y1477F CHC was not detectably tyrosine phosphorylated compared to transfected wild - type CHC in response to EGF stimula - tion ( Figure 6C ) . In some experiments , a background level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Y1477F CHC was detectable , at a very low level , which might be due to infrequent trimerization of the mutant CHC with endoge - nous CHC . In our experience with expression of trans - fected clathrin hub molecules , transfected CHCs do not seem to trimerize at significant levels with endogenous CHCs ( Liu et al . , 1998 ) . We therefore conclude from the mutant data that the major CHC site phosphorylated during ligand - induced endocytosis of EGF is tyrosine 1477 , the target of pp60 c - src kinase . Loss of pp60 c - src Activity Prevents Clathrin Redistribution and Delays EGF Endocytosis To determine whether pp60 c - src kinase phosphorylation of CHC , in response to EGF , is related to peripheral re - cruitment of clathrin , we analyzed EGF - mediated clathrin redistribution in mouse cell lines lacking expression of pp60 c - src kinase ( Figure 7A ) . Recruitment was measured biochemically in these cells . Levels of clathrin asso - ciated with the plasma membrane fraction , after EGF stimulation , were determined by quantitative immuno - blotting . In the cell line 1T , produced by SV40T transfor - mation of fibroblasts from an embryo lacking pp60 c - src , there was no significant clathrin recruitment in response to EGF , compared to the 8T line transformed by SV40 Figure 4 .

Blots were stripped between exposure to the different antibody probes . 1T cells relative to the wild - type 8T cells reproduces the effect of PP1 inhibitor on A431 cells , relating pp60 c - src - mediated phosphorylation to clathrin redistribution . To determine whether the lack of pp60 c - src also caused a showed that the rate of uptake by the pp60 c - src - minus 1T cells was slowed relative to the rate for 8T cells , with delay in EGF endocytosis , as seen with PP1 treatment of A431 cells , the 1T and 8T cells were exposed to either the rates equalizing after 1 min of EGF exposure ( Figure 7B ) . Internalization of the Oregon green EGF showed 125 I - EGF or Oregon green – labeled EGF , and uptake was assessed . Kinetic analysis of internalization of 125 I - EGF little detectable endocytosis up to 3 min ( Figure 7C ) in Clathrin Phosphorylation in EGF Endocytosis 683 1T cells , while internalization was readily visible over the same period for 8T cells . Oregon green EGF uptake was detectable in 1T cells from 5 – 20 min , but EGF accu - mulated more peripherally in the 1T cells than the 8T cells , suggesting a delay in intracellular targeting as well as in endocytosis ( Figure 7D ) . This delay in the early stages of EGF - induced endocytosis for cells lacking pp60 c - src corresponded to the same time course of the delay observed for EGF - induced endocytosis by PP1 - treated A431 cells ( Figure 4E ) . Discussion We report that EGFR signaling , in response to EGF bind - ing , stimulates SRC kinase activity which is required for CHC phosphorylation and clathrin redistribution to the cell periphery , indicating that downstream receptor sig - naling has a direct effect upon the endocytic machinery . Specific inhibition or genetic deletion of SRC family ki - nase activity delays endocytosis of EGF . These results suggest that EGFR signaling can regulate clathrin - medi - ated membrane traffic and thereby defines a novel path - way in ligand - induced endocytosis for this receptor . Regulation of Endocytosis by CHC Modification and Clathrin Recruitment Ligand - induced endocytosisrepresents theextreme sit - uation in which clathrin - mediated endocytosis is regu - lated , since receptor uptake occurs only when ligand has bound . This process is characteristic of some sig - naling receptors and although each receptor has unique aspects to its uptake , there seem to be some shared regulatory features , such as exposure of adaptor - bind - ing motifs by receptor signaling ( Schmid , 1997 ) . A sec - ond one , established here , is a signaling - dependent ef - fect on clathrin . This has already been described for endocytosis of the (cid:98) 2 - adrenergic G protein – coupled re - ceptor , which , when ligand - activated , binds (cid:98) - arrestin , a protein that interacts directly with clathrin ( Ferguson et al . , 1996 ; Freedman and Lefkowitz , 1996 ; Goodman et al . , 1996 ) . Here we demonstrate that ligand activa - tion of EGFR , a receptor tyrosine kinase , has a related mechanism , since it influences clathrin recruitment and causes direct modification of clathrin itself . Inhibition of EGF - induced clathrin phosphorylation has several ef - fects , suggesting that this modification may influence EGF endocytosis at more than one step . Early stages of ligand - gated EGF uptake are delayed in the absence of CHC phosphorylation , due to an initial slowed rate of Figure 7 .

It is possible that tyrosine phosphorylation of residue 1477 tion has an immediate effect on enhancing EGF endocy - tosis and a subsequent effect on clathrin accumulation causes an increase in clathrin assembly by directly af - fecting CHC interactions or that it affects assembly indi - in the periphery and on intracellular targeting of EGF . The slowed intracellular targeting could reflect initial rectly by negating the inhibitory effects that light chains have on assembly . Alternatively , tyrosine phosphoryla - delays in endocytosis , but it could also reflect an alter - ation in endosomal sorting of EGF .

Itshouldbe reported here . Clathrin phosphorylation is in a region of the molecule that controls assembly , so immediate pointed out that the phosphorylation and recruitment of clathrinrepresent onlyasubset ofthe molecularrequire - phosphorylation of local pools of clathrin upon EGF sig - nalingcouldinfluencelocalcoatedpitformation .

The work reported in this study suggests that pp60 c - src in the endosome .

A role for pp60 c - src in could possibly play a role in other instances of ligand - induced endocytosis and may , under certain circum - EGFR endocytosis was previously indicated by the ef - fect of its overexpression , which increased the internal - stances , influence constitutive endocytosis .

In the case of a pathway as impor - tant as regulated endocytosis , it would not be surprising of ligand - induced clathrin recruitment may also be if , in different tissues , different SRC family kinases could linked to CHC phosphorylation .

In fact , this is likely of its receptor causes tyrosine phosphorylation of CHC because the phenotype of mice lacking pp60 c - src would and redistribution of clathrin to the cell periphery , similar be more dramatic if ligand - induced uptake of tyrosine to EGF treatment ( E .
