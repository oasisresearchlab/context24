Introduction Protein phosphorylation by kinase plays a vital regulatory role in many signi ﬁ cant biological processes involving cellular signal communications , metabolic pathways , neural activities , and so on ( Sebolt - Leopold and English , 2006 ) . Aberrant kinase activities are related with many human cancers . Receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) , which are regulated by kinase , have emerged as promising targets for cancer therapy ( Nunes - Xavier et al . , 2013 ) . As a member of RTKs superfamily , Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) has been of increasing interest ( Burgess , 2008 ; Kümler et al . , 2014 ; Zhang et al . , ( 2014 ) ) . It is a cellular transmembrane protein activated through binding to its set of growth factors such as the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and the transforming growth factor ( TGF ) ( Perry and Desplan , 2013 ) . Over - expression of EGFR is a common event in numerous types of human cancers , making it a promising target for screening for likelihood of cancer ( Galizia et al . , 2007 ; Skoda et al . , 2014 ; Zhang et al . , ( 2014 ) ) . Hence , there has been a growing interest in determining EGFR expression levels as a target for screening developments of anti - cancer therapeutic agents . There are many conventional techniques for EGFR detec - tion , such as Western Blotting , immuno ﬂ uorescence assay and enzyme - linked immunosorbant assay ( Thariat et al . , 2012 ) . Such assays are effective but require sophisticated preparation of recognition protein or labor - intensive labeling procedures . Since a large number of cells or biomolecules are involved , the property of individuals might be hidden owing to the inherent heteroge - neity of biosystems ( Allison et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , a novel assay to investigate membrane proteins at molecular level on single living cell is worth developing and still the forefront of the ﬁ eld . The advent of Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) has opened new opportunities for single cell in ﬂ uid , yet it is still a challenge and there is large potential for further study ( Shi et al . , 2012 ; You and Yu , 1999 ) . As a very high - resolution type of scanning probe microscopy , AFM is shown to be a powerful tool for imaging membrane proteins at the nanometric scale ( Chopinet et al . , 2013 ; Girasole et al . , 2012 ; Li et al . , 2013 ; Prabhune et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , AFM is applied to measure the changes in the biophysical properties of the cell , such as stiffness , elasticity , adhesion , and so on ( Canale et al . , 2013 ; Chiou et al . , 2013 ; Dufrene and Pelling , 2013 ; Wu et al . , 2010 ) . The interaction between ligand / antibody and its target molecule can also be investigated ( Heinisch and Dufrene 2010 ) . Recently , EGFR on the cell surface was studied by AFM . Gunning et al . reported adhesive events between wheat germ agglutinin and the glycosylated extracellular domain III of EGFR on human intestinal epithelial cells . ( Gunning et al . , 2008 ) . The kinetic off rates and the distances from the energy minimum to the transition states of the unbind - ing of EGF / EGFR complex and TGF - a / EGFR complex on human bladder cancer cells were investigated ( Zhang et al . , 2013 ) . Although these papers showed AFM was used to investigate the interaction of ligand and EGFR , the effect of drug on EGFR expres - sion levels on MCF - 7 cells has not been reported . Determining EGFR expression levels as a target for screening developments of anti - cancer therapeutic agents is worthy for further study .

Biosensors and Bioelectronics 56 ( 2014 ) 271 – 277 one kind of antineoplastic agent , shows promising potential in the treatment of different types of cancer cell , such as breast , hepatocel - lular , gastric and colon ( Aiyer et al . , 2012 ; Tang et al . , 2008 ) . Since the anti - tumor signaling pathways are complex , the mechanism of the anti - tumor effects of resveratrol is incompletely understood . As reported , resveratrol can induce tumor cell death by preventing PTKs ' activation , inhibiting the activity of EGFR and reducing EGFR expres - sion levels ( Carpenter and Jiang , 2013 ; Stewart and O ’ Brian , 2004 ) . Here , a new method based on AFM was developed to in - situ detect EGFR expression levels on living cells for evaluating the anticancer activity of resveratrol . The inhibition effect of resvera - trol on the expression of EGFR on MCF - 7 cells was probed by EGF - functionalized tips . Changes in morphology and stiffness of single cell induced by resveratrol were detected . The cell viability and the EGFR expression levels on the cell surface were observed using MTT assay and confocal microscopy , respectively . We expect that this method will be useful for screening anti - cancer therapeutic agents and investigating potential targets for drugs . 2 . Material and methods 2 . 1 . Reagent and instrument Human breast cancer cell lines MCF - 7 were donated by Institute of Physiology , Jinan University . RPMI 1640 medium and fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) were purchased from Gibco Co . Resveratrol ( Z 98 % purity ) was purchased from Langze pharmaceutical technology co . , LTD . ( Nanjing , China ) . 4 % Paraformaldehyde was obtained from Sigma Company . 3 - aminopropyl triethoxy silane ( 3 - APTES ) was purchased from QiYun biological technology co . , LTD . ( Guangzhou , China ) . 50 % Glutaraldehyde was obtained from Damao chemical reagent factory ( Tianjin , China ) . Epidermal Growth Factor ( EGF ) was purchased from PEPROTECH Company . Rabbit anti - EGFR / rhodamin B isothiocyanate ( RBITC ) was purchased from Beijing biosynthesis Biotechnology Co . , LTD . Double - distilled water was used in all experiments . The AFM system was BioScope Catalyst ( Bruker , German ) . The AFM probes were Tap 150Al - G Silicon probes , which purchased from BudgetSensors Company ( Bulgaria ) . 2 . 2 . Cell culture Human breast cancer cell lines MCF - 7 were grown in RPMI 1640 culture media supplemented with 100 U / ml streptomycin , 100 U / ml penicillin and 10 % fetal bovine serum at 37 1 C in a humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . 2 . 3 . Immobilization of EGF on AFM tips The immobilization of EGF on the AFM tips were done by the following procedures ( Kao et al . , 2012b ) : ( 1 ) AFM tips were immersed in ethanol for 10 min and irradiated with ultraviolet light for 30 min . ( 2 ) The tips were cleaned by immersing in piranha solution ( H 2 SO 4 : H 2 O 2 ¼ 3 : 1 , v / v ) for 5 min to remove impurities and then rinsed with water . ( CAUTION : the piranha solution is highly corrosive and should be used with extreme caution . ) ( 3 ) The cleaned tips were incubated in 3 - APTES ( 1 . 0 % v / v ) in ethanol for 1 h , and then rinsed thoroughly with the solvent to remove any unbound silane . ( 4 ) 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde solution in PBS buffer ( 0 . 01 mol / L , pH 7 . 4 ) was used to activate the tips by incubating them in the solution for 1 h at room temperature . The unbounded glutaraldehyde was removed by rinsing with buffer . ( 5 ) For the protein immobilization , the treated tips were then inserted into EGF solution ( 100 μ g / ml ) and incubated overnight at 4 1 C . The unbounded EGF was removed by rinsing with buffer and stored in PBS at 4 1 C until used . 2 . 4 . MTT assay The cell suspensions ( 1 (cid:2) 10 5 cells / ml ) were transferred into a 96 - well plate . Resveratrol was dissolved in DMSO ( dimethyl sulfoxide ) and diluted by medium and the concentration of DMSO was kept no more than 1 ‰ . Each well was then mixed with 20 μ l of resveratrol solution of different concentrations ( 0 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 50 and 100 μ g / ml ) and each sample was collected in triplicate . After 24 h incubation , 20 μ l MTT ( 0 . 1 % ) was added and incubated for 4 h . A MTT - based colorimetric assay was conducted by adding 150 μ l DMSO into each well at room temperature . Absorbance at 570 nm of each well sample was measured in a dual - beam microtiter plate . Cell survival rates ( % ) were determined by ( OD treatment (cid:3) OD blank / OD control (cid:3) OD blank ) (cid:2) 100 % . The half maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC 50 ) was obtained from the plot of survival rates ( % ) vs . resveratrol concentrations . The assay was performed four times in the same manner . 2 . 5 . Confocal ﬂ uorescence imaging of EGFR on MCF - 7 cells The ﬂ uorescence labeling procedures for rabbit anti - EGFR / RBITC and DAPI were as follows : MCF - 7 cells treated with different concentrations of resveratrol for 24 h were washed three times with PBS buffer . After that , cells were ﬁ xed by 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde for 15 min and washed three times by PBS buffer prior to staining . 1 % bovine serum albumin was used to block the cells for 15 min . Then , cells were incubated with 200 μ l rabbit anti - EGFR / RBITC ( 200 nM ) at 37 1 C for 30 min and 100 μ l DAPI ( 0 . 1 μ g / ml ) for 4 min . Then cells were washed thrice with buffer and imaged by a Carl Zeiss LCM 510 Meta Duo Scan laser scanning confocal microscope . The images were processed by Zeiss LSCM - equipped software . 2 . 6 . AFM measurements AFM is usually combined with optical microscopy to help select the desired cells . MCF - 7 cells were imaged with Tap 150Al - G Silicon AFM probes in ScanAsyst mode , which is an imaging mode with automatic image optimization technology . The material properties and dimen - sions of the AFM tips used in this experiment were as follows : resonance frequency of 150 kHz ( 7 75 kHz ) , force constant of 5 N / m ( 7 2 N / m ) , cantilever length of 125 μ m ( 7 10 μ m ) , cantilever width of 25 μ m ( 7 5 μ m ) , cantilever thickness of 2 . 1 μ m ( 7 1 μ m ) , tip radius of 10 nm ( 7 2 nm ) and tip height of 17 μ m ( 7 2 μ m ) . For the imaging of living MCF - 7 cells in control group , monolayer of cells that ﬁ rmly attached to the substrate or those that have a ﬂ at - shaped morphology were selected to observe in medium solution . In the resveratrol - treated groups , the cells which were not strongly attached to the substrate after resveratrol treatment were ﬁ xed by 4 % paraformalde - hyde at room temperature for 10 min and imaged in air at 256 (cid:2) 256 pixels resolution and 0 . 9 Hz scan speed . The scan area was from 30 (cid:2) 30 m m 2 to 50 (cid:2) 50 m m 2 depending on the size of the cancer cell . Each set of measurement was performed on ﬁ ve different cells . All the force curves were measured on un ﬁ xed cells in PBS buffer at a forward velocity and retraction velocity of 4 . 1 μ m / s in Point and Shoot mode . The unbinding force is dependence on the loading rate ( Zhang et al . , 2013 ; Zhao et al . , 2013 ) . So , it is necessary to specify the actual retraction velocity for comparing molecular interaction force correctly . Surface delay of 1 s was selected to guarantee enough time for receptor - ligand interaction ( Kao et al . , 2012a ; Kao et al . , 2012b ) . Data was collected with the same tip on ﬁ ve different cells , at selected eight locations ( the area of 1 m m 2 ) including the central and side regions of each cell . The force curves were measured more than 300 times per cell , more than 1500 times for each treated group . Nanoscope analysis software 8 . 14 was used for image processing and data analysis . The parameters for evaluating cell surface roughness are arith - metic average roughness ( Ra ) and root - mean - square roughness ( Rq ) , which are dependent on the sampling size . Here , Ra and Rq were L . Zhang et al . / Biosensors and Bioelectronics 56 ( 2014 ) 271 – 277 272 calculated for two different areas : 6 (cid:2) 6 μ m 2 ( selected 15 randomly ) and 3 (cid:2) 3 μ m 2 ( selected 15 randomly ) . A two - tailed Student ' s t - test was used in statistical analysis to determine the signi ﬁ cant differ - ences in Ra and Rq . P - values o 0 . 05 were considered signi ﬁ cant . The cell stiffness was obtained through the force curves of cells when the probe was approached to the surface of samples . To determine the appropriate position of force curves and avoid the interference of defects or impurities , the samples were imaged in PBS buffer ﬁ rstly . Young ' s modulus , which was calculated via Nanoscope analysis software 8 . 14 directly , was used to express the difference in stiffness of the cells in control and treated groups ( Alsteens et al . , 2008 ; Guo et al . , 2012 ; Roduit et al . , 2009 ) . The spring constant of tips were calibrated by the thermal - noise method ( Kim et al . , 2010 ) in a clean culture dish containing PBS , which were in the range of 4 . 172 – 7 . 013 N / m . 3 . Results and discussion 3 . 1 . Effect of resveratrol on cell viability by the MTT assay Cytotoxicity of resveratrol in human breast cancer cell line MCF - 7 was determined by MTT assay ( Fig . S1 ) . After treatment of resveratrol , the data exhibited a dose - dependent markedly inhib - ited growth on MCF - 7 . Cell survival rates of the MCF - 7 cells treated with 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 50 and 100 μ g / ml resveratrol were 85 % , 73 % , 53 % , 46 % , 41 % and 18 % of the control , respectively . The IC 50 value was 27 . 59 μ g / ml . The results implied that resveratrol was cytotoxic to MCF - 7 cells in a dose - dependent manner signi ﬁ cantly . 3 . 2 . Fluorescence imaging of EGFR distribution on MCF - 7 cells surface The ﬂ uorescence labeling technology was used to visualize the expression of EGFR on cell surface with or without resveratrol treatment . The positions of red and blue ﬂ uorescence represented EGFR and the nuclei , respectively . As shown in Fig . 1A , cells in control group were typically of long - spindle shape and strong ﬂ uorescence intensity was observed . After being treated with 10 μ g / ml resveratrol , the shape of cells had no signi ﬁ cant changes while ﬂ uorescence intensity decreased slightly ( Fig . 1B ) . Furthermore , after being treated with 40 μ g / ml resveratrol , the shape of MCF - 7 cells turned round and the ﬂ uorescence intensity was signi ﬁ cantly reduced ( Fig . 1C ) . Fig . 1 A 2 - C 2 also shows that the cell nucleus shrink after being treated Fig . 1 .

Thepositionofred ﬂ uorescence ( A 1 , B 1 and C 1 ) represents RBITC - labeled anti - EGFR whichbinds speci ﬁ cally to EGFR andblue ﬂ uorescence ( A 2 , B 2 and C 2 ) represents the position of nuclei of MCF - 7 cells stained with DAPI . The merged images of red ﬂ uorescence with blue ﬂ uorescence images are shown in A 3 , B 3 and C 3 , respectively . Scale bar : 20 μ m . L . Zhang et al . / Biosensors and Bioelectronics 56 ( 2014 ) 271 – 277 273 with resveratrol . Experimental results indicated that resveratrol reduced the EGFR expression levels on the living cells surface . 3 . 3 . AFM observations for surface morphology and nanomechanical properties of single MCF - 7 cell As shown in Fig . 2 , the ﬁ rst column ( A 1 - F 1 ) and third column ( A 3 - F 3 ) are height and three dimensional images of single MCF - 7 cell treated with 0 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 100 μ g / ml resveratrol for 24 h . In the control group , cells revealed typical long spindle shaped morphology and obvious pseudopodium connecting each other . The cell membranes were relatively smooth and intact . With the increasing treatment concentration of resveratrol , obvious mor - phology changes were observed , such as shrinkage and roundout , even collapse . Pseudopodium disappeared and the cell membranes were damaged . Fig . 3 shows the average in height of cells increased slightly with treatment , nevertheless it has no signi ﬁ cant correla - tion with the concentration of drug treatment . For each group , the averaged data was determined from more than ﬁ ve cells . Meanwhile , as shown in the second column ( A 2 - F 2 ) and fourth column ( A 4 - F 4 ) of Fig . 2 , AFM provides the information on the alterations of cell surface ultrastructure at the nanometric scale . The cell membrane architecture of control group ( Fig . 2A 2 ) was homogeneous with spherical surface protrusions of around 50 nm . In the drug - treated groups , change in morphological of cells was in a dose - dependent manner , with the spherical surface protrusions increasing to around 140 nm . An analysis of the surface roughness was used to study changes of the cancer cell morphology quanti - tatively . As shown in Fig . 3 , both R a and R q of two different areas show signi ﬁ cant dependence on the resveratrol treatment Fig . 2 . Representative AFM images of MCF - 7 cells treated with 0 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 100 μ g / ml resveratrol for 24 h . The ﬁ rst column ( A 1 - F 1 ) and third column ( A 3 - F 3 ) show height and three dimensional images of the entire cells , respectively . The second column ( A 2 - F 2 ) and fourth column ( A 4 - F 4 ) show magni ﬁ ed height and three dimensional ( 3D ) images ( 5 (cid:2) 5 μ m 2 ) of the cells , respectively . The colors in the images indicate different heights with light and dark colors corresponding to higher and lower topography , respectively . Scale bar : A 1 - F 1 , 5 μ m ; A 2 - B 2 , 500 nm ; C 2 - F 2 , 800 nm . L . Zhang et al . / Biosensors and Bioelectronics 56 ( 2014 ) 271 – 277 274 conditions . R a and R q of cells in control group are minimum , as expected by the smooth surface shown in Fig . 2A 2 and A 4 . In the treated cells , the values of R a and R q increased with treatment concentration , indicating a rougher surface . Fig . 4A – C shows the typical force curves measured on cells treated with 0 , 20 , 100 μ g / ml resveratrol for 24 h , in which line ( a ) and ( b ) represent trace and retrace curves , respectively . The result showed Young ' s modulus of cells in control group was 12 . 10 7 1 . 92 kPa . While Young ' s modulus of cells treated with 20 μ g / ml and 100 μ g / ml resveratrol were 17 . 82 7 2 . 75 kPa and 176 . 26 7 9 . 33 kPa . It demonstrated that the positive correlation between the stiffness of cells and drug concentration . As we know , the elasticity of cells concerned mainly with the intrinsic properties of the cell membrane and components of the cell cytoskeleton , such as microtubules , intermediate ﬁ bers and actin ﬁ bers . Untreated cells had elastic properties , which is to say , a cell ' s shape would deform under the external pressure applied by an AFM tip , but it would spring back to its original shape once the force was removed . Nevertheless , if the cell or membrane is damaged by a drug like resveratrol , the cell would lose its original elasticity , which would lead to the increasing stiffness of cell . It indicated the relationship between the cytotoxicity of resvera - trol and the biomechanical properties of the cells . 3 . 4 . Recognition of EGFR on living MCF - 7 cells surface with an EGF - functionalized AFM tip As shown in Fig . 5A and B , AFM images of a living MCF - 7 cell are obtained in PBS buffer at scan size of 50 m m 2 by a bare tip . The bright regions of the images corresponded to the nuclei regions . Some membrane details such as ripples and ﬁ laments became visible in Peak Force Error image of the cell ( Fig . 5B ) . The EGF - functionalized AFM tips were used to investigate the changes in expression of EGFR on the cell surface after resveratrol treatment . Under the same condition and with the same AFM tip , the highest one of the many rupture events in a single force curve was selected to determine the unbinding forces . Fig . 5C shows the unbinding force as the function of resveratrol concentration . It was obviously observed that the unbinding force had no signi ﬁ cant changes compared the untreated group with no more than 20 μ g / ml drug treatment groups and the magnitude of force was around 8 nN at a retraction velocity of 4 . 1 μ m / s . Nevertheless , when the cells were treated with 40 μ g / ml resveratrol , the unbinding force was signi ﬁ cantly reduced to about 2 nN at the same retraction velocity . The in ﬂ uencing factors of the unbinding force are com - plex . Different cells have speci ﬁ c properties and the cellular state Fig . 3 . Cell height and the surface roughness parameters Ra and Rq for different areas ( 6 (cid:2) 6 μ m 2 and 3 (cid:2) 3 μ m 2 ) as the function of different treatment concentra - tions ( 0 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 100 μ g / ml ) of resveratrol for 24 h , respectively . Fig . 4 . Force curves measured on MCF - 7 cell in control group ( A ) and on cells treated with 20 μ g / ml ( B ) and 100 μ g / ml ( C ) resveratrol for 24 h in PBS buffer , in which the insert pictures represent height morphology of force curves measurement regions . Scale bar : 500 nm . ( D ) shows histogram of Young ' s modulus of cells . L . Zhang et al . / Biosensors and Bioelectronics 56 ( 2014 ) 271 – 277 275 will change after the drug treatment . In addition , the amount of EGF molecules immobilized on the AFM tip also in ﬂ uences the unbinding force measurement signi ﬁ cantly . Fig . 5D is the repre - sentative force curves measured on cells treated with 0 , 20 and 100 μ g / ml resveratrol by an EGF - functionalized AFM tip . As com - paration , the line ( a ) in Fig . 5D presents force curve measured on cells in control with a bare tip . The presentation of the force histogram of total 1500 force curves measured on untreated cell membrane is shown in Fig . 5E . The unbinding forces were in the range from 6 to 12 nN with the most probable value at 9 nN . About 19 . 8 % of the total 1500 force curves - measuring spots on the membrane were capable of binding to EGF - functionalized AFM tips in control group . In contrast , resveratrol - treated MCF - 7 cells expressed less EGFR molecules , which resulted in the less possi - bility of binding to EGF - functionalized tips . In the 20 μ g / ml resveratrol - treated group , most of the forces were focused on 5 – 9 nN , revealing an average unbinding force was 7 . 5 nN at the same condition ( Fig . 5F ) . However , in the group of 100 μ g / ml resveratrol treatment , the major peak of force histogram was in 1 – 2 . 5 nN and the average force was 1 . 5 nN ( Fig . 5G ) . It was obvious that the binding probability had dramatically decreased from 19 . 8 % to 3 . 3 % due to less expression of EGFR on the treated cells as shown in Fig . 5E – G . The consequences from AFM recognition experiment were consistent with the results of confocal micros - copy assay . To con ﬁ rm the speci ﬁ city of the unbinding between EGF and EGFR , block experiments were performed . Brie ﬂ y , EGF solution ( 100 mg / ml ) was gently added to the untreated living MCF - 7 cells to block the receptors on the cell surface ( 30 min incubation ) and the force curves measured by an EGF - functionalized tip were recorded . Typical force curve showing speci ﬁ c interaction between EGF and EGFR on the surface of intact cells is shown in Fig . 5H . The inset shows the speci ﬁ c interaction is blocked by adding free EGF to the solution . Obviously , when cells were incubated in the presence of EGF , the retraces were essentially devoid of unbinding events , which resulting in overlapping retraction and approach curves . The data shows in the inset to Fig . 5H demonstrated suf ﬁ ciently that the interaction forces recorded for EGF and EGFR were speci ﬁ c . 4 . Conclusion In this paper , a novel method was developed to study the effect of resveratrol on EGFR expression levels on living MCF - 7 cells and evaluate the anticancer activity of resveratrol . AFM technique was used to in - situ investigate the expression of EGFR on the cell surface and the nanomechanical properties of cells stimulated by resveratrol at different concentrations . The inhibition effect of resveratrol on the expression of EGFR was probed by EGF - functionalized tips . Changes in morphology and the stiffness of single MCF - 7 cells induced by resveratrol were detected . The results , which were also interpreted by MTT assay and confocal microscopy assay , showed that resveratrol in ﬂ uenced the cellular state and reduced expression of EGFR on MCF - 7 cells in dose - dependent manners . It reminded that the anti - tumor effect of resveratrol worked in a preventing PTKs ' activation way . Our results provided a better understanding of the nanobiology of EGFR molecules on the surface of MCF - 7 cells . Moreover , AFM technique , which was used to investigate potential targets for anti - tumor drug and explore drug action mechanism on living cells , was expected to be developed into a promising tool for screening of drugs .
