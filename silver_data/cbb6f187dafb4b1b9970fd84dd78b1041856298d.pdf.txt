Healing Justice : A Framework for Collective Healing and Well - Being from Systemic Traumas Brooke Bosley Christina N . Harrington Georgia Institute of Technology Carnegie Mellon University Atlanta , GA , USA Pittsburgh , PA , USA Susana M . Morris Christopher A . Le Dantec Georgia Institute of Technology Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta , GA , USA Atlanta , GA , USA ABSTRACT The 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in the United States demanded police reform and legislative action . Data - driven policing is just one technological intervention designed with the hope to tackle police brutality . However , these design interventions are often rooted in the continued racial profling of poor and socially marginalized communities . Designers and researchers need a Healing Justice framework to circumvent this harm . Healing Justice addresses gen - erational trauma and violence in marginalized communities and is not just a framework for policing but can address maternal mortal - ity rates , COVID - 19 , medical malpractice , and other trauma issues . In this paper , we apply a Healing Justice framework to co - design activities focused on police brutality . We bridge Healing Justice and design by using an Afrofuturist Feminism framework , arguing that Healing Justice and Afrofuturist feminism frameworks lead to collective , grassroots , and pragmatic designs .

These practices were a reminder of the generational trauma and violence that have plagued Black communities . 18 - year - old Darnella Frazier best expressed This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution International 4 . 0 License .

Frazier stated , “It’s been nights I stayed up apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life” [ 57 ] . Many Black people like Fra - zier are left with trauma and guilt , from physical police interactions to constantly being privy to these stories through the media . Polic - ing requires community - driven design solutions . Sociologist Alex Vitale argues policing needs reform ; and accountability for racists and ableist practices . Vitale states , “the culture of the police must be changed , so it is no longer obsessed with the use of threats and violence to control the poor and socially marginal” [ 61 ] . We need new approaches to community safety designed by Black and Brown communities that are not rooted in systemic racism . Harrington et . al . note that centering equitable experiences and outcomes leads to reconstructing collaborative design as more collective , grassroots , and pragmatic in fostering equity - driven approaches [ 37 ] . Equitable approaches to community safety require interventions not driven by a white supremacist lens . Race and Technology scholars Ruha Benjamin , Simone Browne , and Sasha Costanza - Chock attest that these traumas occur within technology design , too , since algorithmic systems are racialized and operate from a white supremacist lens [ 8 , 14 , 20 ] . They argue that methodologies grounded in humanities and activism like Healing Justice , Black Feminism , and Afrofuturism are critical in addressing equitable technology design . Healing Justice is a framework con - ceived by healers and organizers across the southeastern United States who formed the Kindred Healing Justice Collective [ 44 ] . The framework addresses collective harm and trauma through med - itation , altar - building , ritual , facilitation , art creation , and other non - western healing practices to create community well - being and safety [ 44 ] . Healing Justice is the design intervention needed to tackle policing . The framework maps the cultural memory and collective trauma within systemic problems like policing in order to design alternative practices . Healing Justice is not just for orga - nizers but for everyone impacted by systemic racism . Imagining a world through a Healing Justice framework means mental health experts de - escalating harmful situations instead of relying on police intervention . Healing Justice means utilizing a non - racialized neighborhood app or a website promoting mutual aid instead of waiting on legislative action . Healing Justice also requires medical practices that center the experiences and needs of Black women and LGBTQ + individuals . When Healing Justice is integrated into the design process , we argue that it tackles white 471 DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia Brooke Bosley , Christina N . Harrington , Susana M . Morris , and Christopher A . Le Dantec supremacy and heteropatriarchal systems impacting policies and technology design among Black and Brown communities . Three critical research questions guided our study : ( 1 ) What are the attributes and features of tools that help Black communities heal from police brutality ? ( 2 ) How can Black joy become a tool for healing ? ( 3 ) Could methods of Healing Justice and Afrofuturist Femi - nism ofer guidance for designing tools that center joy and healing ? To answer these questions , ten participants who identifed as Black or African American living across the southeast United States completed three self - guided design activities and participated in a workshop on police brutality . Historical precedence suggests that a Healing Justice framework leads to collective , grassroots , and pragmatic designs . Kindred’s Healing Justice Collective states , “we sought to map and elevate how our movements and communities build collective care , safety , and protection for each other in the South” [ 44 ] . The collective calls out four ways healing occurs : from labor ( work ) , body ( physical or mental ) , land ( space we occupy ) , and spirit ( our ways of knowing ) . Considering the Healing Justice framework within the design pro - cess : 1 - helps researchers consider the impact that solutions can have on Black communities , especially regarding carceral systems ; 2 - builds a holistic design that focuses on community , healing , joy , and rest ; and 3 - prompts individuals to apply an intersectional lens when designing a critical problem . Designing through a Healing Justice lens recognizes that technology design will continue to per - petuate white supremacy unless it addresses the collective trauma impacting Black and Brown communities . We use Healing Justice as an extension of Afrofuturist and Black Feminist scholarship within HCI to allow participants to reimagine community safety . Afrofuturism and Black Feminism allow marginalized communi - ties to think critically about the past , present , and future in design - ing for wicked problems like policing . Mark Dery coined ‘Afrofu - turism’ to describe Black Science Fiction writers developing futures that centered around Blackness [ 25 ] . Scholars and practitioners have pushed the term beyond Dery’s original conception to envi - sion not just livable but radical existences among Black and Brown communities in present and future [ 15 ] . This term is an epistemol - ogy and aesthetic implemented in literature , arts , digital media , and , more recently , a framework engaged by HCI scholars . HCI scholars such as Winchester , Harrington , Bray , O’Leary , Dando , and others use Afrofuturism as a lens to help envision systems and tools where all Black people are free from harm [ 10 , 23 , 36 , 60 , 63 ] . Scholars argue that not only is Afrofuturism a valuable design lens that may lead to more empathetic and inclusive engagements around technology [ 62 , 63 ] , but that theoretical frameworks such as Black feminism , and even ‘Afrofuturist feminism’ should be critical underpinnings of the ways we implement Afrofuturism in design [ 39 ] . HCI scholars such as Rankin , Irish , Thomas , and Erete have used Black feminism to design critical tools that center Black women in the design and consideration of technology and research practices [ 28 , 29 , 52 , 53 ] . Thus pushing forward inclusive design frameworks for marginalized communities that consider new exis - tences of justice , healing and joy must also contend with tenets of Afrofuturism , Black feminism , and Afrofuturist feminism . Humanities scholar Susana M . Morris frst introduced ‘Afrofu - turist Feminism’ to describe the intersections of Black Feminism and Afrofuturism in combating white supremacy , violence , survival , oppression , family structures , and other elements [ 49 , 50 ] . Methods of Afrofuturist Feminism consist of creating parallel feminist uni - verses , remixing dominant future discourse , and are not utopias but shaped by feminist principles and actions [ 49 ] . Afrofuturist Femi - nism ‘is’ Black livability . When applied to design , a Healing Justice framework extends Afrofuturist Feminism by tackling systemic racism , generational traumas , violence , and other inequities . To explore this framework and its potential for design , we conducted a series of design workshops with 10 Black Americans across the United States . Our workshops found that methods of Afrofuturist Feminism in a Healing Justice framework fueled participants to envision community safety outside of racist and ableist policing practices , and instead grounded in healing for the present . Our re - search makes the following contributions : 1 - design workshops that apply Healing Justice to design interventions focused on policing in the United States , and 2 - an application of considering Black joy in design , amplifying previous HCI literature [ 38 , 51 ] . Healing Justice provides design interventions in technology design that have the potential to combat systemic oppression like policing . Throughout this paper , we argue for more design - based research that centers on practices of joy and healing in creating futures that are not trauma or violence stricken . 2 RELATED WORK In answering our three critical questions around Healing Justice and Afrofuturist Feminism , we looked to prior HCI literature that centers around marginalized communities creating tools that ofer joy and healing . The literature is pulled from three relevant areas : Designing for Civic Engagement , Afrofuturism in HCI , and Healing Justice and Tenets of Joy . 2 . 1 Designing for Civic Engagement Designing for civic engagement has explored various aspects of citizen and community participation to empower people to take part in shaping their societal conditions and environments . Litera - ture in HCI includes designing for people’s relationship between government and public tools to designing technology for local citi - zens [ 16 , 35 , 37 , 40 ] . Harding et . al . defne civic engagement as “an individual or collective action designed to identify or address a particular public concern such as urban maintenance that includes activities from refuse collection , upkeep of social housing , food risk management through to highway repair " [ 35 ] . Traditional ap - proaches to designing for civic engagement draw from principles of community design and participatory or action - based research structures [ 2 – 4 ] . However , research studies have found that these processes can also be tools of inequities and limit access to marginal - ized groups in the relationship between designer and community . Harrington , Erete , and Piper provide a series of case studies on Black and Hispanic communities where these practices have been a form of exclusion [ 37 ] , stating “certain methods , such as the de - sign workshop , or approaches to design thinking ( e . g . , ‘blue sky’ ideation ) have an ethos that can be exclusionary to communities 472 Healing Justice : A Framework for Collective Healing and Well - Being from Systemic Traumas DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia that have historically faced systemic discrimination " [ 37 ] . Nontra - ditional approaches to civic engagement push for inclusion in the research process . Design Justice and Creative Reaction Lab are a few groups that view research participants as the experts [ 37 ] . Similarly , Le Dantec and Fox argue that the core of civic engagement is the work done prior to the beginning of the research which requires relationship building [ 32 , 46 ] . Through relationship building , the community and designers work on tailoring the research plan to the community’s needs creating trust in the process . Prefgurative design , as used by Asad , is a critical approach that looks to decolonizing participatory research methods that uses principles like anarchism and social activism as methods that ofer insight on ways to critically engage with communities [ 3 ] . Asad defnes prefgurative design as “design work oriented in service of progressive political goals to both represent these goals as design objects , and also structure design processes to try to actualize these goals . . . prefgurative design prompts practitioners and researchers to both imagine alternative futures and to structure design processes to manifest them in the present " [ 3 ] . Nontraditional and decolonized approaches to designing for civic engagement focus on the com - munity in determining interventions , steps away from traditional action - based and participatory research terminology and look to practices and ideology that focus on community . Similarly , ‘social justice - oriented interaction design’ as defned by Dombrowski et al . suggests a way to engage with “thorny political issues " in ethical and morally responsible ways [ 27 ] . It identifes strategies such as designing for enablement which afords individuals to fulfll their potential and to develop their own capacity while creating possibil - ities for change . There is a common theme among these approaches to designing for civic engagement that call for participation that is not only steeped in equity but also in restorative practices , espe - cially for historically and racially marginalized groups in the United States . 2 . 2 Afrofuturism in HCI Case studies of groups engaging with complex political issues may also be seen in the emergence of Afrofuturism in HCI and interac - tion design methodology [ 62 ] . Various scholars contend that frame - works like Afrofuturism allow for a more empathetic engagement with race and political issues in design [ 36 , 62 , 63 ] , and thus may have promise for areas of civic engagement . Our understanding of Afrofuturism as a methodological approach comes from cultural theorist Eshun . Eshun states , “Afrofuturism may be characterized as a program for recovering the histories of counter - futures cre - ated in a century hostile to Afrodiasporic projection and as a space within which the critical work of manufacturing tools capable of intervention within the current political dispensation may be un - dertaken " [ 30 ] . Eshun views Afrofuturism as an intervention that can be molded into a framework , toolkit , principle , grounded in uncovering and reframing Black histories to build equitable futures . HCI practitioner Winchester uses Afrofuturism as a lens for design thinking [ 62 , 63 ] , noting , “Afrofuturism equips the designer to en - gage with notions of diference " [ 62 ] . He applies the lens to Black women’s wearable health technology by considering the discrim - inatory practices in the medical feld compared to other women . Accounting for those diferences , practitioners become mindful of exclusion in technology design [ 62 ] but may also be applied to areas of community design . Harrington and Dillahunt build on Winchester’s work by exploring the societal inequities faced by Black and LatinX youth in Chicago using Afrofuturism - inspired co - design workshops to examine both participation and constructs of power and inclusion in design work [ 36 ] . They discuss that a speculative design approach grounded in Afrofuturism promotes dealing with societal and politically - minded issues . The use of Afrofuturist concepts also occurs in educational work - shops , Dando et . al . used Afrofuturist principles to work with stu - dents around STEAM - based learning [ 23 ] . The maker space allowed researchers to integrate Afrofuturist principles in the design ac - tivities through music , readings , and even classroom set up that encouraged imagination . Similarly , Harrington and Dillahunt ap - ply an Afrofuturist lens to working with students from Chicago in envisioning Black futures [ 36 ] . By engaging with Afrofuturist concepts , students could reimagine futures centering Blackness and their community . These studies highlight Afrofuturism’s role in inclusive design and speculative futures work . Leaning into Afro - futurist methodologies means approaches and solutions that are community - centered . HCI practitioners have engaged with Afrofu - turist literature to gain further insight into these approaches . Ferri and Gloerich reimagine design fction through the works of Octavia E . Butler [ 31 ] . Butler ofers a praxis that pushes against privileged points of view , but as the authors argue , provides a plural viewpoint that would be valuable in HCI and humanities literature . Similarly , Kristen Reynolds calls the literary work of Octavia E . Butler and N . K . Jemisin essential in ofering examples of technolog - ically driven futures grounded in Blackness [ 54 ] . Reynolds , Ferri , Gloerich , and other HCI practitioners [ 31 , 54 , 56 ] focus on how Afrofuturist literature ofers critical components that combat anti - Blackness in design strategies , an alternative to current speculative design that is often rooted in whiteness . Similar to Bardzell’s call for a community of practice around feminist thoughts and ideas [ 6 , 7 ] , Morris defnes Afrofuturist Feminism as situating transgres - sive , feminist practices as key to a progressive future . In Black Girls Are from the Future : Afrofuturist Feminism in Octavia E . Butler’s “Fledgling " Morris highlights that Afrofuturism is “an epistomology that both examines the current problems faced by Black and people of color more generally and critiques interpretations of the past and future " [ 49 ] . Other scholars suggest that Afrofuturist feminism is about imagining beyond the systems of oppression of which they are currently bound [ 45 ] . Tapping into Afrofuturist Feminism is anchored in Black lived experiences that push for resiliency against white supremacy . Afrofuturist Feminism works at the intersection of Black Fem - inism and Afrofuturism in tackling systems of white supremacy in technology design [ 49 , 50 ] . The tenets of Afrofuturist Feminism are : 1 - systems of power centering around the most marginalized , 2 - pulls from rest , liberation , pleasure , and joy to envision equi - table technology , 3 - becomes integral in part of the design process by challenging the designer and researcher to re frame questions about the impact of output on community . Afrofuturism becomes more than a cultural production but a praxis for designing equitable futures centered around joy and healing . 473 DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia Brooke Bosley , Christina N . Harrington , Susana M . Morris , and Christopher A . Le Dantec Figure 1 : Our study procedure 2 . 3 Healing Justice and Tenets of Joy Black and Brown communities experience trauma and violence from practices like policing . The Healing Justice framework ad - dresses the root of trauma and violence through techniques like tenets of joy that counter these experiences . Healing Justice and tenets of joy is a current untapped research area in HCI . Recent HCI research looks at self - healing and self - preparedness in computer - ized systems [ 9 ] . When scholars like Goldenberg or Hillman address joy , it centers around computer science education or technology design . Goldenberg et . al . ofer a study on a computer science ed - ucation curriculum centered around joy in design principles [ 33 ] . They state , “beauty and joy : helping students recognize , respect , grow , and enjoy their logic and creativity in CS . The aesthetic of programming is not just in its products ; programs , themselves , can have intellectual beauty " [ 33 ] . Through this example , the tenet of joy is shown through tapping into creativity and other areas of un - tapped potential [ 9 , 42 ] . The term is often used to describe creating a sense of pleasure on a technological device or experience . Joy also shows up in how researchers study the interface experience . From understanding how eCommerce users fnd and navigate joy online to intensifying moments of pleasure on digital interfaces [ 33 , 42 ] . However , Healing Justice is often found across social movements ( i . e . , disability justice , movement for Black Lives , gay rights , etc . ) . The recent article from Harrington and colleagues titled “De - signing for the Black Experience " argues that HCI research needs to engage with Black communities outside of areas of trauma - stricken ideals but centering joy , happiness , and love [ 38 ] . Two tenets of joy are identifed through scholarship around Black and African Ameri - can identity in the United States . First is pleasure grounded in Black Feminist scholarship from writers such as Audre Lorde , adrienne maree brown , L . H . Stallings , and Joan Morgan [ 12 , 47 , 48 , 59 ] . They collectively argue that pleasure is reclaiming our satisfable selves against oppression or supremacy ; it goes beyond sexual desire . In “Uses of the Erotic : The Erotic as Power , " Black lesbian writer Audre Lorde states , “As we begin to recognize our deepest feelings , we begin to give up , of necessity , being satisfed with sufering and self - negation , and with the numbness which so often seems like their only alternative in our society " [ 47 ] . Lorde describes that once an individual truly recognizes pleasure for themselves , they no longer fll the need to conform to a life that does not bring or ofer joy . Pleasure becomes a form of Healing Justice because you do what feels good , not what society expects . The second tenet of joy is collective memory as a tool to reimag - ine futures . Kindred Southern Healing Justice Collective writes about the importance of collective memory in creating joyful mo - ments for our future . They state , “everything we want to change in the world around us also exists right here in our bodies . We carry the histories of our people’s trauma and our struggles . They are here , both strengthening us with what they have taught us and also holding us back as our fears , anxieties and survival strategies keep us away from the things that could most support our libera - tion " [ 44 ] . Memories are often passed down to generations through oral or written histories . They become ingrained in how we move about the world . Kindred acknowledges within that statement the multilayered impact that these systems have on communities and individuals . HCI needs more research grounded in a praxis of Heal - ing Justice and joy beyond technological devices but centers around communities . Designing for Civic Engagement , Afrofuturism in HCI , and Healing Justice and Tenets of Joy introduce decolonized research approaches among HCI literature . Civic engagement ofers a framework on how to center community interventions and activism . Afrofuturism considers past and present diferences in designing for change . The core of civic engagement and Afrofuturism is the desire to live in a 474 Healing Justice : A Framework for Collective Healing and Well - Being from Systemic Traumas DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia community that provides joy and not trauma - stricken experiences . The literature from the related works was foundational in building a study that focused on healing from generational trauma and violence . The solutions fostered healing and joy by anchoring the study in community - driven approaches . 3 METHODOLOGY 3 . 1 Study Overview and Participants Our study sought to understand the main attributes and features of tools tackling trauma ( like policing ) and how Healing Justice as an extension of Afrofuturist Feminism can guide interventions that center healing and Black joy . The study occurred virtually due to COVID - 19 from February to April 2021 . The virtual format allowed us to gain insight into Healing Justice as a design intervention and build a research environment that fostered creativity through workbook activities , workshops , and surveys ( See Figure 1 ) . The format was meant to follow the structure transformative justice organizers use when developing community - based strate - gies around safety [ 26 ] . To identify participants for this study , we deployed a screening survey among social media , friends , family , and grassroots organizations focused on voting rights and Black Lives Matter initiatives . The screener allowed us to gauge time com - mitment , comfortability discussing police brutality , and willingness to share personal experiences . From those initial screenings , 10 participants completed the study and received a compensation of 50 dollars . Work by Ambe et al . [ 1 ] suggests that there is value in gathering rich qualitative data from a smaller sample size , specif - ically when this group is typically harder to recruit in academic research . Participant demographic information was collected dur - ing the workshop and survey ( see Table 1 ) . All participants reported as Black or African American . Participants’ age was not collected ; however , to complete the study individuals had to be 18 years or older . There was a range of professions represented , with many of our participants identifying as a being a student . In the follow - ing sections we provide an overview and details of the workshop components . 3 . 2 Design Workbook and Activities To answer the questions around designing tools for healing from policing , we developed a design workbook that participants were given a week before the design workshop that consisted of reading materials and three activities ( See Figure 2 ) . The workbook consisted of three design activities , defnitions Figure 3 : Refection slide from the workshop called ‘Black ( on ‘Blackness’ , ‘Queerness’ , ‘Black Lives Matter’ , ‘Disabilities’ , ‘De - joy bursts’ moments , participants stopped discussing polic - sign Process’ , and ‘Healing Justice’ ) , and reading excerpts ( from ing and centered on healing through relaxation . Octavia E . Butler’s Parable Series , Toni Morrison’s Beloved , Nikki Giovanni’s ‘Legacies’ , Tricia Hersey’s The Nap Ministry , Victoria Dugger ‘Out of Body’ , and Leiomy Maldonado’s poem ‘Be True’ ) . The defnitions and readings introduced participants to key ideas and terms used throughout the study . More importantly , with the grounded in the past had participants design a storyboard retelling addition of the activities , the workbook’s design sought to help their experience with the Black Lives Matter protest of summer participants generate ideas and solutions to address policing and 2020 . The present prompt invited individuals to create a program community safety . or digital tool that could bring healing or joy to a community in In the spirit of Afrofuturist Feminism , the design activities fo - response to traumatic experiences . Last , we asked participants to cused on the past , present , and future . Figure 4 provides examples of consider how the pandemic and policing would impact the near three participants’ engagement with the activities .

We incorporated Heal - ing Justice in the workshop through refections , meditations , and moments of rest that allowed participants to express joy , grief , and rage . The practice of Healing Justice gave participants a safe space to discuss the impact of traumas like policing and the ways healing could be integrated in their daily life . Workshop activities incorpo - rated a Healing Justice approach and integrated breaks and group refections . We started the workshop with an ice breaker where individuals shared names , pronouns , and Emoji or GIF represent - ing their current mood . Figure 3 is an example of these workshop refections . After introductions , for the frst half of the workshops participants refected and shared what they had created during the self - guided design workbook . The second half of the workshops , individuals were split into groups where they redid the last design workbook activity . By redoing the activity collaboratively , partici - pants were able to apply Healing Justice to design solutions that tackled policing by centering joy . Given the weight of topics like policing and systematic racism , it was crucial that we build in breaks between activities . We curated moments called ‘Black joy bursts’ where we invited participants to get in a comfortable chair or space to share thoughts aloud or in the chat . Prompts were given related to recent moments that made individuals laugh or feel good . At the end of the workshop , each participant was given a guided mediation around Healing Justice and Afrofuturist Feminism . 3 . 4 Pre and Post Survey Participants also completed a pre - and post - survey after the self - guided design activities and workshop sessions . The pre - survey goal was to gauge how individuals incorporated Black joy and heal - ing elements from lived experiences into the solutions . The survey asked fve questions to gain those insights , which included : the process of using the workbook , the solutions created for policing , the impact of solutions on Black communities , Black joy in their an - swer , and how their experiences of policing infuenced or impacted the guide . After participants completed the workshop and group design activities , they met a post - workshop survey . The purpose of the post - survey was to see how the group conversations during the design workshop impacted or changed the solution and to see if the introduction of the framework Afrofuturist Feminism ofered as a critical approach to the users . The main diference in the surveys was we reworked three questions to focus on the efectiveness of Afrofuturist Feminism principles and Healing Justice , using those principles for issues on policing and applying these principles to problems like gentrifcation . 3 . 5 Data Analysis The workshops were held on Microsoft Teams which allowed the research team to use the recording and transcription features of the app . We collected survey data , audio recordings of workshop , and participant design activities . Recordings were transcribed manually by one of the authors for clarity and annotated to identify criti - cal thoughts among the research team . The initial research team ( author 1 and 3 ) analyzed the surveys , design activities , workshop conversations , and group activities . Authors 1 and 3 were able to refect on the data from their own personal experiences as Black women living in the southeastern United States and familiar with the policing structures and experiences of many participants in the workshops . These experiences allowed a multi - layered refection on the participants’ personal experience . We used an inductive process that identifed essential terms and methods mentioned across these tools , as defned by Irving Seidman and John W . Creswell [ 21 , 55 ] . The terms were selected if an average number of participants ( four or more ) mentioned the terms to help limit our own bias or pro - jections . The remainder of our research team ( Authors 2 and 4 ) then analyzed the themes that emerged . The entire research team discussed the fndings and revisited notes from the workshop to help address confrmation bias as well . We identifed the following terms : defunding , abolishment , mu - tual aids , self - care , Black joy , lived experiences , legislation , Black community , memories , social media , news outlets , corporations , boundaries , trauma , racism , COVID - 19 , mandates , grief , policing , education , Black Lives Matter , riots , protests , and hopelessness . The order of the terms is not signifcant , but in the fndings section we focus on four of these subsets because they aforded the greatest insight . 4 FINDINGS Our analysis incorporates pre / post surveys , workbook activities , and workshop materials . This analysis identifed four themes : 1 - 476 Healing Justice : A Framework for Collective Healing and Well - Being from Systemic Traumas DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia Figure 4 : A visual representation of the three design workbook activities a few participants completed . Defunding and Abolishment of Police ; 2 - Boundaries as an Act of Self Care , 3 - Creating Black Joy after Trauma ; and 4 - Lived Experiences Impacted Designs . The themes correlate to the critical questions we sought to answer at the beginning of the study . Defunding , abolishment , and lived experiences mapped onto the attributes and features of tools that help Black communities heal after trauma . The section on Black joy and boundaries correlate to our second research question centered on Black joy as a tool for healing . Each of these sections touch on methods of Healing Justice and Afrofuturist Feminism across the study . The workshop sessions led participants to create a ‘Healing Justice block party’ inspired by Beyoncé’s 1 performance at the Coachella music festival , designing a neighborhood app for Black and Brown parents , rethinking community policing , and ofering both legal and grief services to families who experienced police brutality . The study and fndings illustrate the difculties of creating tools for healing when harm has been caused by a dominant system or institution such as policing in the United States . 4 . 1 Defunding and Abolishment of Police Defunding and abolishment of the police was a Healing Justice so - lution for some participants . Four of the ten participants were vocal about the complete abolishment of the police . The remaining par - ticipants believed a form of defunding police should occur . Because of this , our frst workbook activity on envisioning the year 2025 1 Black American Singer , Song - Writer , Actor , and Dancer through a collage was challenging for participants ; a few shared the following : “Some challenges I found were thinking about a world without police brutality and envisioning its form . That is what we as Black people fght for every day , but it seems like sometimes it’s such a far - fetched idea , and thinking about it is harder than I thought it would be . " - Participant 6 Individuals like Participant 6 felt that inaction from the govern - ment on policing made thinking about change in the United States difcult . In fgure 5 Participant 1 and Participant 2 created collages on the year 2025 that show legislation and grassroots approaches central in tackling policing . Participant 2 expanded by sharing , “I am not sure I could come up with solutions . I think by 2025 , there will be legislation that gets us closer to our goal of no police brutality but I think about protests , mu - tual aid , and being able to have these conversations with family members and activism online as being critical too . " - Participant 2 These participant quotes describe the challenges that occurred when imagining a present and future society with no policing . However , they also called out how mutual aid , community conver - sations , and activism online were critical in addressing systemic racism . For some participants , defunding the police and community - based safety practices were the start to creating a world with no 477 DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia Brooke Bosley , Christina N .

During the group activity of the workshop session , Partici - pants 6 and 7 proposed community policing and self - sufciency in Black and Brown communities . Participant 7 suggested a solution where ofcers were required to live in the neighborhood to build community relationships . Although , there was some push back from the other member on the efectiveness of community policing they came to a consensus . “By returning to community policing , you have ofcers who are less likely to use force against the people they know in the community . " - Participant 6 The participants felt that police living in communities would help build relationships with folks causing more connections and less chance for misuse of power . Participants also believed that programming that created self - sufciency among Black and Brown communities was needed in addition to community policing . Partic - ipants 6 and 7 defne self - sufciency as providing communities with community - based resources that support veterans , food , mental health , job , and educational services that rely on methods outside of the government . The group looked to the Black Panthers free breakfast program , which ran from 1969 to 1980 , as community programming [ 19 , 58 ] . The technology component would be an app that would provide a list of mutual aid and community resources to address specifc problems . ‘Defunding’ for the group meant refocus - ing on community care and redirecting it to creating community programming that limits harm by ofering resources . A majority of the participants felt that to truly address policing it means tackling the institutional structure . “We also need to attack the root and slowly make our way to eradicating the system that creates and allows the problems to exist . " - Participant 1 Like Participant 1 , Participant 6 felt that addressing the root of the problem started with centering the needs of socially marginal individuals : “All I could really think of is defunding of the police and more mental health resources . " - Participant 6 . The practice of ‘defunding’ and ‘abolishment’ were steps that participants believed would eradicate these systems . 4 . 2 Boundaries as an Act of Self - Care The second fnding was that boundaries were not only a form of Healing Justice but an act of self - care in individuals’ daily lives . All participants were unfamiliar with the term ‘Healing Justice’ ; many assumed the word was whitewashed and had no grounding in protests movements like Black Lives Matter . Once we described the word in the workshop , participants then provided examples of creating boundaries among coworkers , friends , family , and others . In the storyboard workbook activity , Participant 3 refected on a conversation she had around the Black Lives Matter protests in Minneapolis , Minnesota , that led to riots in the community after the death of George Floyd : “The night of the riots , I had an associate post that she doesn’t understand why they are rioting . She proceeded to call the rioters stupid amongst other names . As some - one who has not shown this ignorance before , I was shocked and proceeded to explain to her the death that just happened and why the Black community was tired . I also showed in history dating back to the French rev - olution as to how riots were the start of a new system . This back and forth happened for some hours , when I realized that she didn’t want to understand and had made up her mind that a random Target was far more valuable than the lives and voices of Black people . " - Participant 3 Participant 3 highlighted the difcult conversations that Black people experienced in 2020 and how rage was a valid emotional response to police brutality . In the workshop , Participant 3 elab - orated further by sharing that she eventually blocked the person due to their unwillingness and desire to hear the truth which led to a form of self - healing . The majority of the participants resonated with Participant 3 giving a variety of ways they set boundaries . Some examples of setting boundaries were muting negative con - versations toward protesters and rioters , unfollowing certain news outlets , and taking breaks from social media . This boundary setting also caused a form of guilt among a few participants , in a candid conversation between Participant 6 and Participant 7 during the workshop they shared the following exchange : “Personally , I don’t think there’s a select method , I just give myself a break period from seeing it cause it’s so much to see , especially when like the protest and Floyd and then the young man that happened here in Atlanta , Georgia like seeing it day after day and repeat after repeat . I defnitely put my phone down or turn of the TV for a while just to . . . You know , breath basically . " - Participant 7 Participant 6 also expressed a similar sentiment : “Yeah , I think that’s so important too , like setting bound - aries with the media . At the start of summer 2020 , I was involved 100 percent , I was posting , posting , and posting . I even went to a protest like I was just really heavily involved . It defnitely got overwhelming and it was draining so I had to take a step back from social media and just . Focus on myself , but I don’t know . I felt guilty doing it . " - Participant 6 478 Healing Justice : A Framework for Collective Healing and Well - Being from Systemic Traumas DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia For Participants 6 and 7 , social media and the twenty - four - hour news cycle made reports on police brutality overwhelming . Step - ping away from these media outlets brought a temporary feeling of peace . Although some individuals expressed a form of guilt , every - one felt that self - care and healing was extremely important when tackling systemic racism . During the last group study session , three of the ten participants discussed the difculties of incorporating self - care when doing emotionally exhausting labor . Participant 10 shared that self - care was important and that they had to defne it for themselves outside of how capitalism or generational trauma had infuenced the process . In response Participant 8 shared the desire to not only create a form of Healing Justice that was personal self - care but collective care against burnout and other forms of guilt . They also reiterated that in forming boundaries it was also important to remove forms of guilt and defne self - care individually . Setting boundaries toward relationships and the media also meant for some participants not to rely on technology that nega - tively impacts Black communities . One of the groups applied the concept of boundaries to the Nextdoor app , a social media platform for neighborhoods . The app is known to racially profle Black and Brown people by allowing racially insensitive posts to community moderators , silencing posts of Black people [ 5 , 43 ] . Even though Nextdoor had well - meaning intentions , forms of racism have been ingrained . The group’s project was a neighborhood app catered toward Black and Brown parents and families funded through mu - tual aids . The app would address bias and surveillance by using a hybrid of algorithms and human moderators to flter out inap - propriate conversations . Although they did not create a mock app , they did discuss the interface as having similar features to Twitter from organizing content chronologically , being mobile - friendly , and limiting the number of characters on posted content . The fo - cus of the project was to counter the surveillance of Black and Brown children by developing an app focused on their well - being and safety . Boundaries in the solution occurred through fltering conversations that do not perpetuate bias and rejecting stereotypes fueled by these platforms . Through the project and discussions , it was a consistent theme that boundaries provided an act of self - care and Healing Justice that tackled systemic racism by saying ‘no’ . 4 . 3 Creating Black Joy after Trauma Participants suggested that when designing for Black joy , it should not be linked to traumatic experiences . Participants defned Black joy as healing , community , liberation , freedom without the fear of being threatened or abused , listening to Anita Baker 2 , or watching television shows . As described by the Black Youth Project , Black joy is Black people centering joy and healing in their physical and digital lives [ 22 ] . The last workbook activity focused on partici - pants developing a solution ( i . e . , program , app , policy , tool ) that brings healing to Black communities after police brutality occurs by incorporating Black joy . Participants found it challenging to visualize joy after painful experiences and shared the following : “I don’t have Black joy in my solution because while we can choose to smile through the pain , I think we need to take precise actions to target the problem and fnd a way to solve it . Then once the issue is gone , we can 2 A Black American Singer and Song - Writer genuinely have Black joy without being scared for the next victim . " - Participant 1 Participant 4 expressed similar thoughts , “I had a hard time with the last activity in the workbook . It was a confusing question . I didn’t understand how to show Black joy after a tragedy . I have seen many communities of color pick themselves up after incidents of police brutality . However , I know that sometimes it is hard . " - Participant 4 Participant 3 discussed the difculty in designing for Black joy and ways it occurs in digital spaces : “I couldn’t come up with a solution , because from my un - derstanding , the act of Black joy on an app or a platform for healing . Black people always make culture wherever we go and have found ways to cope and survive certain situations on any platform we touch . I think it is going to be hard to put all of that on one app . " - Participant 3 Participants 1 , 3 , and 4 did not believe Black joy could be a response to traumas from police brutality , but instead was liberation or something that arose authentically . For many of the participants , when tragedies like policing occurred , it meant picking oneself up to challenging policing practices ; it did not center on healing or joy . Participant 3 noted that the activities fueled pessimism during the workshop , making it challenging to incorporate Black joy as a solution . Participant 9 expressed the limitations of Black joy as a solution in trauma driven experiences . “Black joy looks and feels like a community . I think that Black Twitter was an example that I was building on because of the ways that it ofers those a space to share and connect with individuals they might not know . Additionally , I think Black joy is freedom without fear of being threatened or abused I do not think that it specifcally targets police brutality as the main goal of the solution . " - Participant 9 For her Black joy was not a solution to these systemic and struc - tural problems but tied directly to creating spaces of freedom and liberation . Participant 10 shared that the journey to cultivate Black joy was difcult , and instead they found themselves reliving mo - ments of trauma . They expounded on these thoughts in the story - board activity , “I myself struggle with fnding joy . I routinely work with local organizers to combat the forces that continue to oppress impoverished communities , often black . I get overwhelmed and I start to shut down . I try to avoid updates on the Derek Chauvin trial but have been dev - astated by recent police shootings of Daunte Wright and Adam Toledo . I had a stress dream yesterday where I heard the ‘not guilty’ verdict for Derek Chauvin and broke down and cried . The psychological trauma stays with me even when I try to disengage . " - Participant 10 Participant 10’s quote is a reminder that for many Black people it is difcult to fnd joy when you become inundated with oppressive systems daily . Participant 9 quote also calls out the mental traumas that occur from constantly witnessing systemic racism online . One group set out to design a block party that would cultivate Black 479 DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia Brooke Bosley , Christina N . Harrington , Susana M . Morris , and Christopher A . Le Dantec joy and healing . The group was inspired by the 2018 Coachella performance from Beyoncé and the accompanying Netfix special titled Homecoming that provided details on the performance . Figure 6 provides a visualization of how the group envisioned meditation experiences , motivational speakers , food , and dancing to center Black joy outside of trauma . For this group in order to cultivate these experiences outside of trauma was through activating moments of Black joy . For all participants Black joy was liberation and not tied to instances of policing or trauma . Figure 6 : Ideation board created during group activity on a Healing Justice inspired block party 4 . 4 Lived Experiences Impacted Designs The fourth fnding was that participants’ lived experiences as Black or African American impacted the design activities . From daily experiences with systemic racism to countless news stories around discriminatory practices and behaviors permeated many individu - als’ thoughts around the possibility of solutions . Participants ex - pressed frustrations when colleagues or friends asked them to share their experiences as being Black in America as a tool to educate and create change . During the frst workshop , participants expressed this not just as burdensome . They refected that white people are rarely forced to confront racism or develop solutions to the prob - lems , but it is often left up to Black and Brown communities . A few participants refected on how being Black impacted their inter - action with the study when taking the post - survey : “recent events have been heavily infuential on the way I interacted with this activity and my beliefs . " - Participant 9 The 2020 responses to Black Lives Matter , from lack of govern - ment action to company commitments , were a fresh memory to many participants . Participant 2 spoke heavily of relying on grass - roots initiatives like a neighborhood safety plan or investing in mutual aid instead of organizations . Their experiences have shaped how they approach movements like Black Lives Matter . “neighborhood demographic changing shifts how to pro - tect and make the community safe without calling the police , relying on neighbors for help especially if every - one has lived there a long time . " - Participant 2 Participant 2 , like so many others , looked to community and grassroots organizing as ways to tackle these problems immedi - ately . Participant 5 , during the workbook activity , looked to their encounters with police as a Black male in motivating the solution . They stated , “my main plan was for citizen review of police encoun - ters through city / county / state built apps ( preferably through a web page so you don’t end up with people downloading what could be used as spyware on their phones ) that logged date and time , the individuals in - volved , how they felt about the interaction and the out - come . " - Participant 5 Participant 5 felt that documenting police could help push for legislation to actionable change in policing in the United States . Throughout these workshops many participants pulled on their lived experiences to make for change they wanted in their com - munities . One group proposed a nonproft organization to support families that have experienced police brutality . The organization would provide a lawyer and private investigators in response to the incidents . The organization would have three distinct features : ( 1 ) Ofer free resources , such as mentors , therapists , lawyers , to help guide the victim’s family on how to process and go to court . ( 2 ) Catalog the experiences and recommendations of the families of past victims in articles and media streams ( 3 ) Keep Black and Brown communities informed on the policy changes or non - policy changes at the state and federal level across the United States . In both solutions , participants looked to their lived experiences as Black in America in building solutions that would work around government and other nonproft organizations . Our fndings not only demonstrate the intricacies of Healing Justice , but the com - plexities of designing for systemic problems like policing . 5 DISCUSSION The participant quotes refect the importance for healing centered design interventions , and the difculties of grappling with trauma - based problems like policing . Now more than ever we need solu - tions that seek to tackle the generational trauma and violence that Black and Brown communities are constantly experiencing . In this section we map critical leanings from the project across the three research questions : from the attributes and features that help Black communities heal , to how Black joy can become a tool to heal , and how methods like Healing Justice and Afrofuturist Feminism ofer guidance for designing tools that center joy and healing . 5 . 1 Healing Justice as a Design Intervention Interactive systems like HunchLab , a predictive policing tool , Ring doorbell cameras , Nextdoor , a social networking site for neighbor - hoods , and countless other tools are ingrained with algorithmic bias that preys on Black and Brown communities [ 5 , 43 , 61 ] . Researchers argue that although these tools promise safe communities and pre - ventative measures , they enforce racial profling [ 43 ] . Benjamin and Costanza - Chock note that because so much of our algorithms are rooted in the white supremacist and carceral lens , it becomes ingrained in much of our technology design [ 8 , 20 ] . Data - driven policing is dangerous , especially when innocent Black folks have died from racial bias like Kathryn Johnston in Atlanta , Georgia ; 480 Healing Justice : A Framework for Collective Healing and Well - Being from Systemic Traumas DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia Breonna Taylor in Louisville , Kentucky ; or Tamir Rice in Cleveland , Ohio . Transforming and designing for community safety starts with a Healing Justice Framework , not racial bias . Black Queer Feminist Charlene Carruthers looks to a Healing Justice framework as a preventative step in addressing trauma and violence [ 17 ] . Carruthers notes , “Healing Justice movement works to reclaim the ways our oppressed , surviving communities have always healed , from before colonization to now . Healing Justice is preventive and responsive . It asks us to bring collective practices for healing and transformation into our work " [ 17 ] . From our workshops we found that Healing Justice focused on designing interactive systems has several outcomes : 1 - developing accountability towards system - perpetuated trauma ; 2 - centering the lived experiences of Black and Brown communities ; 3 - building designs that focus on commu - nity , healing , joy , and rest ; and 4 - rejecting carceral design - based solutions or practices . Healing Justice is not just a framework for policing but can reimagine maternal mortality rates , COVID - 19 , medical malprac - tice , housing inequity , and many other design challenges . Healing Justice is a design intervention with many possibilities to transform how design practitioners have built solutions for intricate problem spaces . Black Womxn Flourish , a design collective based in Balti - more , Maryland , uses a Healing Justice framework to create tools for the well - being of Black Womxn [ 13 ] . Through a community - led design process , the group embodies health practice by centering celebration , trust , collaboration , pleasure , and joy [ 13 ] . They have re - imagined the well - being of Black Womxn through meditation , sound healing , breath - work , and other non - western practices as just a few tools [ 13 ] . Colonialism and white supremacy are ingrained in policing and thus there is a need to disassociate from these sys - temic legislation and policies . Healing Justice decolonizes design and creates room for joy and pleasure in the process . Afrofuturism is a cultural movement that constructs liberatory and equitable futures for all marginalized individuals , and has emerged as a valuable theoretical engagement in HCI and design [ 36 , 62 ] . Building futures for all requires addressing systemic racism , generational traumas , violence , and other inequities . Thus , engag - ing with a Healing Justice framework provides practitioners , cre - ators , and others using Afrofuturism to critically consider how to incorporate holistic wellness and community - based safety ap - proaches to enforce accountability among all people . 5 . 2 Critiques of Afrofuturism Afrofuturism is not always perfect . Scholar André Brock critiques Afrofuturism for cultural productions that are too utopian and not taking into account how Black people enact joy in technology [ 11 ] . Instead , Brock ofers a counter to this perspective of Black technoculture that centers on how Black life and joy are enacted across technology [ 11 ] . We agree with this criticism that the practice of Afrofuturism should be centered on current Black technological production . By applying an Afrofuturist Feminism approach , we accounted for these criticisms . Afrofuturist Feminism draws from the intersec - tions of Afrofuturism and Black Feminism . Rankin and Irish note that Black Feminist Thought in HCI , especially in game design [ 53 ] , “disrupts design approaches because it centers Black women as the focal point while pushing against Whiteness and White supremacy " given the intersection of race and gender that shape Black women’s lives . Afrofuturist Feminism similar to the application of Black Fem - inist Thought , Feminism and social justice in HCI explicitly call out intersecting systems of power , more explicitly those that deter marginalized populations from participating in technology design and its ownership [ 6 , 27 , 53 ] . Afrofuturist Feminism pulls from iden - tity politics , lived experiences , power , and Black futures scholarship [ 49 , 50 ] . As seen in our fndings , although participants experienced challenges with imagining near futures due to historical experi - ences with traumas or violence from police , tenets of Afrofuturist Feminism allowed for a creative reimagining of what it means to center joy in imagining beyond current societal circumstances . 5 . 3 Afrofuturist Feminism Design Activities As we described earlier , the participant workbooks included a range of materials and resources from defnitions to readings , examples , and even design activities . Throughout the post - survey and ses - sions , individuals expressed difculty parsing through complex materials . Five of the 10 participants chose to draw or use other forms of communication outside of writing , which correlated to an individual’s time . Materials should be concise and ofer more room for refection and abolitionist visioning . Author Marc Lam - ont Hill defnes an abolitionist vision in We Still Here : Pandemic , Policing , Protest , and Possibility . Hill states , “an abolitionist vision is about more than dismantling the prison . It is about building a world where we work together to meet each other’s needs , a world in which every living being has access to safety , self - determination , freedom , and dignity " [ 41 ] . Hill’s statement provides an example of how projects around policing and protests should be grounded in collectivism . Conducting research projects around topics like policing requires studies that ofer collective research spaces . Conciseness is essential when introducing new terms or ideas and describing concepts like Afrofuturist Feminism and Healing Justice in workshops . For future studies , the information will need to be more easily accessible to allow participants to think expansively about such concepts as they relate to Black Futures and safety . When developing content for workshops , it is essential to ensure that content is concise and will enable individuals to be their whole creative selves without many restrictions . This desire to create materials that will allow individuals to be their true abolitionist selves also requires more HCI research grounded in joy and building equitable futures . 5 . 4 Black Joy as a Design Practice There is also a critical need to disconnect trauma from our research practice and perhaps steer towards joy and pleasure when contex - tualizing experiences of historically marginalized groups [ 38 ] . Har - rington and Dillahunt’s paper , “Eliciting Tech Futures Among Black Young Adults : A Case Study of Remote Speculative Co - Design " , no - ticed that participants’ design futures rarely incorporated themes of Black joy and instead hinged on trauma , inequities , and disparities [ 36 ] . This study established that youth derived speculative futures from their current experiences of being Black and Hispanic in a city that has historically experienced oppression and had a histor - ically tumultuous relationship with law enforcement . Although 481 DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia Brooke Bosley , Christina N . Harrington , Susana M . Morris , and Christopher A . Le Dantec utopian in form , these futures and the technologies that accompa - nied them still incorporated dystopian elements . Participants of these workshops discusses many of the multi - layered problems of policing in their environment , but discussed wanting to exist and imagine futures where these were not constant . Similarly , from our design workshops we found that the community Block party that was inspired by Beyoncé’s 2018 Coachella performance acted as a tool of joy and healing . The group visualized a community party with meditations and relaxation areas , motivational speakers like Roxanne Gay , barbecue , and dancing . Their solutions illustrate that tools for Healing Justice do not have to be reliant on technology . In the block party example , healing was apparent in the act of having a community celebration that would create moments of joy , relax - ation , motivation , and self - care . Workshop attendees demonstrated that Healing Justice could be imagined through programming and centering joy around the neighborhood . Black joy visualized in design was community put into practice . During the workshop , we had periods of refection where it was time to counter discussions with joy . We started the sessions with prompts like “what brings you laughter ? " . Participants felt comfortable sharing videos , images , and even personal stories that felt joyful and were critical about the ways we build and design joy . After completion of our study participants were not just compen - sated fnancially , but everyone received a specialized ten - minute guided meditation on Black joy recorded by Black Joy Yoga founded by Ciera Lewis , a group that centers on rest and healing . These prac - tices were our way of centering Black joy throughout the practice , in more in - person workshops we would have worked at ingraining these moments within the study . If more studies are seeking to design around joy there needs to be less focus on traumatic experi - ences and more ways to fuel periods of joy including the format and actual questions of the study . The literature on Civic Engagement , Afrofuturism , and Heal - ing Justice was foundational in building a study that tackled these racially systemic issues . As more researchers engage with Healing Justice and joy centered on Black communities , producing work - shop materials that allow participants’ fuidity and expression is critical . Findings from the co - design workshops and workbooks were critical in addressing our research questions and gaps in pre - vious literature in the feld . First , although concepts like Healing Justice or Afrofuturist Feminism were unfamiliar and needed to be concise , participants were already engaging in these concepts throughout their lives . Second , Black joy should not be linked di - rectly to experiences of trauma but give participants room to apply these concepts organically . Last , tenets of joy are untapped areas in HCI literature ; therefore , work around self - advocacy provides a start to the feld . 5 . 5 Self - Advocacy as a Tenet of Joy Although there is little research around Healing Justice and the tenets of joy , work on self - advocacy ofers a practical starting point to building out this literature . Defned as representing a person’s views or interests [ 24 ] , it can also act as a form of pleasure or joy . Two pieces of HCI literature ofer foundational insight on self - advocacy as a tenet of joy . First is the term Celebratory Technology introduced by Andrea Grimes Parker in describing new research directions around food [ 34 ] . The term can be extrapolated to not just focus on food , but creativity and pleasure are essential components in the forming of technology . Similarly , Le Dantec and Asad explore self - advocacy among cy - clists around the city of Atlanta [ 4 ] . They found that the cyclists were not only describing bicycling as a form of joy and well - being , but advocacy also meant they were able to ofer suggestions and in - sights on the city’s infrastructure in terms of biking [ 4 ] . The process of self - advocacy can be seen as making way for new possibilities and shaping change . Throughout , the study individuals shared how self - advocacy for Black Lives took place in classrooms , work , online and other environments . Black Feminists Charlene Carruthers and adrienne maree brown describe these actions as not only creating room for possibilities but making way among systems and places that countless ignore you due to perceptions and beliefs [ 12 , 17 ] . By collectively advocating for a community or oneself , joy is formed by envisioning a future where you see yourself liberated . It is also of importance to note that our analysis did not consider the socioeconomic status of participants . The decision not to collect or analyze this data was made due to the authors considering how experiences with racial bias among Black Americans and police does not hinge on income or class as seen with the deaths of Botham Jean in Dallas , Texas and Tamir Rice in Cleveland , Ohio . Healing Justice is a framework rooted in economic justice which suggests that people should have have access to a creative and productive life beyond their economics [ 18 ] , thus we did not choose to identify or defne workshop participants by their economic status in order to acknowledge their humanity and the need for this work beyond a damage - centered lens . 6 CONCLUSION The study set out to understand the attributes and features of tools that help Black communities heal from police brutality . The design workshops and workbooks incorporated methods of Healing Justice as an extension of Afrofuturist Feminism to help facilitate these conversations . The study revealed that research around joy and healing are areas of potential within the feld of HCI . We found that design solutions for traumatic situations rarely incorporate joy as a theme and that lived experiences play a critical part in what individuals deem as possible . Four themes were consistent among the participants 1 - Defunding and abolishing police as a design solution ; 2 - Boundaries as an act of self - care ; 3 - Black joy outside of trauma ; and 4 - Lived experiences impacted designs . We argue that Healing Justice and Afrofuturist Feminism are essential meth - ods in creating workshops and workbooks tackling systemic and institutional structures and Black joy should not be tied directly to traumatic experiences , but instead given room to form organically . As designers seek to create interventions to complex problems like policing , we need more approaches that work through a Healing Justice framework .
