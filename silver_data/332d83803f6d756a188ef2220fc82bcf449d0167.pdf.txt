We investigated a stochastic epidemic model with the metapopulation approach in which patches represent municipalities . Contagion follows a stochastic compartmental model for munici - palities ; the latter , in turn , interact with each other through recurrent mobility . As a case of study , we consider the epidemic of COVID - 19 in Brazil performing data - driven simulations . Properties of the simulated epidemic curves have very broad distributions across diﬀerent geographical locations and scales , from states , passing through intermediate and immediate regions down to municipality levels . Correlations between delay of the epidemic outbreak and distance from the respective capital cities were predicted to be strong in several states and weak in others , signaling inﬂuences of multiple epidemic foci propagating towards the inland cities . Responses of diﬀerent regions to a same mit - igation protocol can vary enormously implying that the policies of combating the epidemics must be engineered according to the region’ speciﬁcity but integrated with the overall situation . Real series of reported cases conﬁrm the qualitative scenarios predicted in simulations . Even though we restricted our study to Brazil , the prospects and model can be extended to other geographical organizations with heterogeneous demographic distributions . I . INTRODUCTION Theoretical and computational toolboxes used and developed by physicists over decades and , in particu - lar , those of equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics have found an inexhaustible source of applica - tions in complexity [ 1 – 4 ] attaining an apex with the rais - ing of network science at late 1990s [ 5 ] . Epidemic models , which are intimately related with nonequilibrium phase transitions [ 6 ] , running on the top of networks soon be - came one of the most imminent ﬁelds of interdisciplinary physics [ 7 – 9 ] with many applications on real epidemic scenarios lead by physicists [ 10 – 12 ] . The pandemic of coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) has been marked by a wide discussion heavily grounded on data - driven epi - demic modeling , again with outstanding contributions lead by physicists [ 13 – 16 ] . Since COVID - 19 outbreak was reported in Wuhan , Hubei province , China , at the end of December 2019 , the scientiﬁc community has turned its attention to un - derstanding and combating this novel threat [ 13 , 14 , 17 – 19 ] . A characteristic of this infectious disease , caused by the pathogen coronavirus SARS - CoV - 2 , is the high transmission rate of individuals without signiﬁcant symp - toms [ 19 , 20 ] who traveled unrestrictedly and spread COVID - 19 through all continents except Antarctica . Ef - forts to track the transmission from Wuhan to the rest of mainland China and world relied on mathematical mod - eling [ 13 , 14 , 18 , 21 , 22 ] , which were soon extended to other countries [ 23 – 25 ] , using the metapopulation ap - proach [ 26 – 28 ] . In this modeling , the population is grouped in patches representing geographic regions and the epidemic contagion obeys standard compartmental models [ 29 ] within the patches , while mobility among them promotes the epidemic to spread through the whole population . Metapopulation approaches , which were ini - tially conceived in ecology contexts [ 30 ] , have been used for many epidemic processes [ 26 – 28 , 31 – 34 ] and allow a geographical resolution absent in standard compartmen - tal models [ 29 ] . One remarkable feature of the metapopu - lation approach is its capability to integrate the epidemic modeling in diﬀerent regions into a single framework , in which correlation between epidemic waves in diﬀerent re - gions can be investigated . We are interested on the geographical variability and impacts of an emerging and highly contagious infections disease such as the COVID - 19 in continental scales and we chose the recent pandemics in Brazil as a case of study . Brazil is a country of continental territory with an area of 8 . 5 × 10 6 km 2 demographically , economically , and developmentally very heterogeneous . It is a federa - tion divided into 26 states and one Federal District , its capital city . States are divided into municipalities ; each state has its own capital city . The total number of mu - nicipalities is 5570 and , according to estimates of 2019 , the country population is approximately 210 million [ 35 ] . Striking characteristics of the Brazilian demography are the broad distributions of the rural and urban popula - tion fractions and urban population densities of munic - ipalities , which are important traits in epidemic model - ing [ 36 , 37 ] . Therefore , investigation of a pandemic and its consequences have necessarily to integrate the partic - ularities of each region , which can be reckoned with the metapopulation approach . In this work , we investigate a metapopulation model and applied it to the COVID - 19 epidemic spread in the Brazilian municipalities . At the time of submission , early June 2020 , the benchmark of 800 000 cases and 40 000 deaths was surpassed in Brazil , which became in this date the country with highest epidemic incidence and possi - bly a new worldwide epicenter of COVID - 19 [ 38 ] . At time of resubmission , mid October 2020 , the number of a r X i v : 2 0 11 . 03380v2 [ phy s i c s . s o c - ph ] 14 N ov 2020 2 cases had surpassed 5 . 5 millions with more than 150 000 deaths . The model is supplied by demographic and mo - bility data mined from public sources , which are used in the stochastic simulations . We quantify how diversiﬁed the epidemic can be across the country rather than try to accurately foresee outbreaks in speciﬁc locations . We determine the level of dispersion in the curves of the epi - demic prevalence in diﬀerent places within a hypothetical scenario of uniform mitigation measures . We take the sit - uation of 31 March 2020 as the initial condition , with foci in 410 municipalities , allowing to track the epidemics in all municipalities in a single integrated simulation . We predicted that the prevalence curves can vary enormously over geographical scales ranging from states down to mu - nicipalities . We also predicted that some states are char - acterized by outbreaks starting mainly in their capital cities , followed by epidemic waves propagating toward the countryside , while in other states there are multiple epidemic foci . Our results explain why policies of com - bating a countrywide pandemic should be simultaneously decentralized , in the sense that each locality has to con - sider its speciﬁcities , and integrated , since the fate of one region depends on the attitudes adopted by others . These qualitative behaviors have been conﬁrmed a posteriori . The remaining of the paper is organized as follows . The model is described in Sec . II while its computer imple - mentation and parameters are in Appendixes A and B , respectively . Model calibration using nowcasting is pre - sented in Sec . III while the detailed results are in Sec . IV . Some discussions and remarks are presented in Sec . V . In Sec . VI , we present a brief afterwords commenting the achievements of the model in forecasting the quali - tative countrywide behavior of the pandemics in Brazil ﬁve months after the predictions were made [ 39 ] . II . THE MODEL A . Metapopulation We consider a stochastic metapopulation model for the countrywide spread of the epidemic , in which a key in - gredient is recurrent mobility [ 28 ] whereby individuals travel to other patches but return to their residence re - currently . The population is divided into patches which represent the places of residence as schematically shown in Fig . 1a ) . Similar models have been used for modeling of COVID - 19 in Spain [ 16 , 24 , 25 ] . In particular , our model is inspired on a recent work [ 24 ] to investigate the COVID - 19 . We use a diﬀerent , continuous - time approach where geographical , demographical , and testing capacity speciﬁcities are included . As in general metapopulation models , a patch can represent a municipality , a neighbor - hood or any other demographic distribution of interest . Each patch is labeled by i = 1 , 2 , . . . , Ω , where Ω is the number of patches , and has a resident population ﬁxed in time given by N i . The inter - patch mobility rate is given by W ij deﬁned as the number of individuals that travel susceptible Exposed asymptomatic unconfirmed confirmed REMOVED a ) S e A U C R b ) FIG . 1 . Schematic representation of a ) metapopulation struc - ture and b ) epidemic transitions with their respective rates . Patches i and j of diﬀerent population sizes ( represented by the areas ) can interchange individuals with rates W ij and W ji . The epidemic events occur within patches under the hypoth - esis of well - mixed populations as illustrated in the zoom of patch l . Six compartments are used : susceptible ( S ) , exposed ( E ) , asymptomatic or presymptomatic ( A ) , unconﬁrmed ( U ) , conﬁrmed ( C ) , and removed ( R ) . The infection rate per con - tact λ X can be of three forms , depending on the infectious contacts : S and A ( λ A ) , S and U ( λ U ) , and S and C ( λ C ) . from i to j and return to i after a typical time T r . A patch j for which W ij > 0 is a neighbor of i . Diﬀerent forms of mobility , with their corresponding characteris - tic times , can be implemented . For the sake of simplicity , recurrent ﬂux of individuals per day ( T r = 1 d ) is used in the present work . Mobility within patches is not ex - plicitly considered . Instead , we assume the well - mixed population hypothesis [ 29 ] where an individual has equal chance to be in contact with any other in the same patch . B . Demography and contacts The average number of contacts per individual of patch i per unit of time is k i . Variations in the social distancing can be implemented by altering k i . Contacts are related to local mobility and are strongly correlated with the population density ξ i . Monotonic increase has been pro - posed [ 36 ] . We follow Ref . [ 24 ] and use a contact number modulated by k i ∝ f ( ξ i ) with f ( ξ ) = 2 − exp ( − aξ ) . To take into account the sparse demographic distribution of Brazil , we used the urban population density of each mu - nicipality to compute ξ i . Interactions between urban and rural populations are also explicitly considered through a symmetric 2 × 2 contact matrix C uu , C rr , and C ur = C ru , 0 ≤ C xy ≤ 1 , determining the contacts between urban ( u ) and rural ( r ) populations whose fractions are represented by ω i and 1 − ω i , respectively . The number of contacts in patch i is also modulated by k i ∝ g i = C uu ω 2 i + 2 ω i ( 1 − ω i ) C ur + ( 1 − ω i ) 2 C rr , ( 1 ) where the terms represent urban - urban , urban - rural , and rural - rural interactions from left to right . The contacts 3 are parameterized by their average number per individual (cid:104) k (cid:105) , such that k i = zg i f ( ξ i ) (cid:104) k (cid:105) , where z is a normaliza - tion factor , required by the relation (cid:80) i k i N i = N tot (cid:104) k (cid:105) and given by z = N tot (cid:80) Ω i = 1 f ( ξ i ) g i N i , ( 2 ) where N tot = (cid:80) i N i is the total population . C . Epidemic model The epidemic dynamics within the patches considers three noncontagious compartments which are : suscepti - ble ( S ) , that can be infected ; removed ( R ) , that repre - sents immunized or deceased individuals ; and exposed ( E ) that carries the virus but does not transmit it . Com - partments of contagious individuals are : asymptomatic ( A ) , that have not presented symptoms ; unconﬁrmed ( U ) , which are symptomatic but not yet identiﬁed by tests ; and conﬁrmed ( C ) , that have tested positive for COVID - 19 . The compartment A is actually a simpliﬁ - cation of the real situation . At least two relevant types of asymptomatic persons do exist : presymptomatic , that will develop symptoms at the end of the incubation pe - riod , and the truly asymptomatic , that becomes recov - ered without any signiﬁcant symptoms . There exist large uncertainties with respect to the fraction of individu - als who are truly asymptomatic [ 40 , 41 ] . According to the parameters used in this work ( see Appendix B ) , we have approximated 30 % of truly asymptomatic in com - partment A which lies within the interval reported else - where [ 40 ] . Due to the uncertainty of the available data , we also assume a same contagion rate for both types of asymptomatic individuals which are hereafter treated as a single compartment . The epidemic transitions obey a SEAUCR model , in which susceptible individuals be - come exposed by contact with contagious persons ( A , U , or C ) with rates λ A , λ U , and λ C , respectively . Ex - posed individuals spontaneously become asymptomatic with rate µ A , while the latter transitions to unconﬁrmed ( presymptomatic ) , conﬁrmed , or removed ( truly asymp - tomatic ) states happen with rates β C , β U , and β R , re - spectively . Finally , unconﬁrmed or conﬁrmed individuals are removed from the epidemic process ( via recovery or death ) with rate α R . The transition U → C has rate α C that may depend on the number of unconﬁrmed cases n U i . For a small n U i the conﬁrmation rate is constant α ( 0 ) C , as - suming that any municipality has the minimal resources for testing . The number of conﬁrmed cases is limited by the ﬁnite testing capacity per inhabitant , ζ . We assume a simple monotonic function α C = α ( 0 ) C 1 + α ( 0 ) C n U i ζN i . ( 3 ) The transition E → U was not included since most studies agree that the asymptomatic or presymptomatic condi - tion is a central characteristic of COVID - 19 [ 19 , 40 – 42 ] . The contact of conﬁrmed individuals is reduced to bk i with b < 1 . Figure 1b ) shows a schematic representation of the epidemic events . Individuals residing in i can move to neighbors j fol - lowing a stochastic process with rates R i / T r where R i is the population fraction of i that moves recurrently ; the destination j is chosen proportionally to W ij . Symp - tomatic ( U or C ) individuals do not leave their residence patches but if the transitions to U or C happen out of his / her residence they return with rate 1 / T r , as do the individuals in other epidemic states . Infection , healing and other transitions follow Poisson processes with the corresponding rates . Details of the computer implemen - tation , using an optimized Gillespie algorithm [ 43 ] , are given in the Appendix A . D . Initial condition The initial condition is a major hurdle for the accu - rate forecasting of a pandemic due to high underscore and delays in reporting . First studies of the COVID - 19 Wuhan outbreak estimated that undocumented in - fections were the source of at least 79 % of documented cases [ 19 ] . This number can be larger depending on the testing policies [ 44 , 45 ] . The investigated scenario was the beginning of the pandemics in Brazil when testing policies and data availability at municipality level were still very premature . We assume a simple linear corre - lation between the increase in the number of conﬁrmed cases of COVID - 19 reported by the oﬃcial authorities and infected cases ( E , A , and U ) in each municipality . We used 31 March 2020 as the initial condition . Let ˜ n conf i ( t ) and ˜ n rem i ( t ) be the number of conﬁrmed and re - moved ( recovered plus deceased ) cases of COVID - 19 in each municipality i [ 38 ] of Brazil at day t . Let t − 1 cor - respond to 24 March , t 0 to 31 March , and t 1 to 4 April 2020 . These data are provided in supplementary material ( SM ) [ 46 ] . The initial condition at t 0 is ˜ n C i ( t 0 ) = ˜ n conf i ( t 0 ) − ˜ n rem i ( t 0 ) ˜ n U i ( t 0 ) = ˜ n conf i ( t 1 ) − ˜ n conf i ( t 0 ) ˜ n A i ( t 0 ) = 2 (cid:2) ˜ n conf i ( t 1 ) − ˜ n conf i ( t 0 ) (cid:3) ˜ n E i ( t 0 ) = 8 (cid:2) ˜ n conf i ( t 1 ) − ˜ n conf i ( t 0 ) (cid:3) ˜ n R i ( t 0 ) = 12˜ n conf i ( t − 1 ) , ( 4 ) where ˜ n X i is the number of individuals in patch i and state X . The last equation means that essentially all in - dividuals who were infected one week before are currently removed . Since we are far from herd immunity at t 0 , this choice is irrelevant . This approach , based on the hypoth - esis that the increase of reported cases is correlated with local transmission , is a way to reduce the eﬀects of un - derreporting . The prefactors were chosen together with the parameter α ( 0 ) C to ﬁt both the initial increase ( ﬁrst two weeks of March ) of the total number cases and of mu - nicipalities with conﬁrmed cases under a weak mitigation 4 0 4 8 12 16 20 days 2 × 10 4 4 × 10 4 6 × 10 4 c on f i r m e d ca s e s noneweakmoderatedata 0 4 8 12 16 20 days 1000 2000 3000 nu m b e r o f c iti e s M = 0 M = 0 . 4 M = 0 . 8 data b ) a ) FIG . 2 .

The last one is consistent with the estimates of the Google Community Mobility Reports for Brazil within this time window [ 47 ] ; see Figs . 2 and 3 . E . Mitigation strategies Diﬀerent mitigation strategies are studied by uniformly reducing the inter - patch mobility and contact by fac - tors ( M , K ) , i . e . , W ij → ( 1 − M ) W ij , for j (cid:54) = i , and k i → ( 1 − K ) k i . We investigate three diﬀerent scenar - ios : none , weak , and moderate mitigations represented by ( M , K ) = ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 . 4 , 0 . 3 ) , and ( 0 . 8 , 0 . 5 ) , respectively . We do not tackle the regime of suppression or strong miti - gation that could drop the epidemic drastically . Averages were evaluated over 10 independent simulations . F . Remarks on parameter choices The extensive set of parameters is aimed to reproduce the essence of the epidemic spreading at a countrywide level but not to track accurately the epidemic outbreak in every state or municipality . We specially assume uni - form and constant control parameters for reduction of inter - municipality movement and contacts as well as the testing rates . This is surely not the real case . Each fed - erative state or municipality has its own mitigation and testing policies that are very heterogeneous . So , assum - ing uniformity and ﬁtting the overall data at a country level , it is possible to infer in which regions the epidemic is evolving faster or slower than the average . Finally , our initial condition is a guess driven by data but still limited . The level of underreporting is known to be high , and broad ranges of values have been reported [ 19 , 44 , 45 ] . The description of the complete set of epidemiological parameters , the initial conditions , mobility and demo - graphic data are given in Appendix B . III . NOWCASTING AND MODEL CALIBRATION Irrespective of the heterogeneous testing approaches among states [ 38 ] , we assume that essentially all munic - ipalities had capacity to detect COVID - 19 in the ﬁrst hospitalized patients and , therefore , the number of mu - nicipalities with positive cases is expected to be an ob - servable much less prone to the eﬀects of underreporting than the number of conﬁrmed cases at the beginning of the pandemics in Brazil . Figure 3 compares the evolution of municipalities with conﬁrmed cases between 1 and 22 April 2020 obtained in simulations with diﬀerent mitiga - tion measures and real data for each Brazilian state and also for the whole country . Weak mitigation provides the best agreement with the reported data whereas devia - tions start to appear after three weeks . The weak mit - igation parameters ( M , K ) = ( 0 . 4 , 0 . 3 ) , which ﬁt better the overall data for Brazil , also perform well for most of the states in this time window and especially those with higher incidence of COVID - 19 in the period , which lead the averages over the country . However , some states ( AC , AM , PA , PE , PI , and RR - abbreviations for Brazilian federative states are given in Fig . 3 ) were more consis - tent with the simulations without mitigation while others ( PB , PR , and RN ) were nearer to a moderate mitigation . No tuning with respect to speciﬁc places was used and , consequently , it does not reproduce accurately the num - ber of reported cases for all federative states due to the diversiﬁed testing and social distancing policies across diﬀerent states and municipalities , in contrast with the uniformity hypothesis of the present study . IV . GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS OF EPIDEMIC PREVALENCE The role of inter - municipality traﬃc is investigated re - ducing the contacts by 30 % and varying the mobility . The total number of cases changes very little since the leading contribution comes from local transmission in municipalities with larger incidence while the number of municipalities with conﬁrmed cases , shown in Fig . 2b ) , depends signiﬁcantly on the inter - municipality traﬃc re - strictions . These results conﬁrm the epidemiological con - cept that reducing long - distance travelling contributes to delaying the outbreak onset in diﬀerent places , but alters little the countrywide epidemic prevalence [ 48 ] , as discussed in the context of COVID - 19 spreading in China [ 13 , 49 ] and Spain [ 25 ] , for example . From now on , generic predictions under the aforemen - tioned hypothetical scenarios are discussed . We stress that these predictions , whose time window spans after the resubmission time , were simulated in April 2020 [ 39 ] . High variability of the epidemic outbreaks ( intensity , du - ration and delays ) can be observed through all geograph - ical scales .

Simulations and observations of the number of municipalities with conﬁrmed cases of COVID - 19 for the 26 federative states of Brazil in the ﬁrst three weeks of simulations . Data for the whole country are shown in the bottom right corner . Simulations were performed using none , weak , and moderate mitigations with parameters ( M , K ) = ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 . 4 , 0 . 3 ) , and ( 0 . 8 , 0 . 5 ) , respectively . scale dispersion in our simulations is remarkable . At the state level , the time when the outbreak reaches its maxi - mum epidemic prevalence , the epidemic peak , varies con - siderably as shown in Figs . 4a ) and 4b ) , where the epi - demic prevalences for all states are shown as function of time for a weak mitigation . Let T and ρ be the time and prevalence of the epi - demic peak , considering both unconﬁrmed and conﬁrmed individuals . According to the simulations with weak mitigation , the ﬁrst state to reach the peak would be CE ( T CE ≈ 34 d ) , followed closely by SP and AM ( T SP ≈ T AM ≈ 36 d ) . The respective prevalences would be ρ CE ≈ 3 . 6 % , ρ SP ≈ 4 . 9 % , and ρ AM ≈ 5 . 0 % . The state with highest epidemic prevalence would be RJ with ρ RJ ≈ 7 . 0 % at T RJ ≈ 40 d . The epidemic peak would happen later ( T MA = 71 d ) , with maximum less intense ( ρ MA ≈ 2 . 3 % ) and the curve broader for the MA state . The MA case is particularly interesting because whereas the peak for the state would happen last , for its capital city S˜ao Luis it would occurs at day 41 slightly earlier than the average peak for Brazil , which would be at day 44 in this scenario . These numbers should not be quan - titatively compared with the real reported cases . Firstly , the conﬁrmed cases correspond to a small fraction of the total of cases that depends on testing rate , an unknown variable in our study , and curves for ρ C are much broader and have the peak postponed to later times . Secondly , the uniform and constant mitigation and testing scenar - ios do not correspond to reality . A spatially more reﬁned analysis is done comparing im - mediate and intermediate geographical regions of a same federative state , which are determined by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geograﬁa e Estat´ıstica ( IBGE ) [ 50 ] . An im - mediate region is a structure of nearby urban areas with intense interchange for immediate needs such as purchas - ing of goods , search for work , health care , and education . An intermediate region agglomerates immediate regions preferentially with the inclusion of large metropolitan ar - eas [ 50 ] laying thus between immediate regions and fed - erative states . In Brazil there are 133 intermediate and 510 immediate regions . Municipalities in diﬀerent feder - ative states do not belong to the same immediate regions even if they have strong ties . The broad variability of epidemic outbreaks observed at the federative state level is repeated at higher resolutions of geographical aggrega - tion . Figures 4c ) to i ) show the multi - scale structure of the outbreaks within the state of MG . They com - pare the epidemic prevalences of diﬀerent intermediate regions , followed by the next scale with all immediate regions belonging to the pair of intermediate ones pre - senting the epidemic peak ﬁrst and last in Figs . 4d ) and e ) . Finally , the highest resolution with curves for munici - palities within the respective immediate regions with the earliest and latest maxima are shown in Figs . 4f ) to i ) . A large dispersion through the 13 intermediate regions of the MG state is seen in Fig . 4c ) . The times and preva - lence values at the peak diﬀer by factors 2 and 6 , respec - tively , between the regions that attain the maximum ﬁrst and last .

SM [ 46 ] for distinct mitigation strategies , showing that the more intense the mitigation the more heterogeneous are the curves across the country . Stepping down to im - mediate regions , a similar behavior is found in Figs . 4d ) and e ) . The intermediate and immediate regions of Belo Horizonte , that include the capital city and are by far the most populous regions of this state , lead the averages over state and intermediate regions , respectively , blurring the actual prevalence in other localities . Variability is still large within immediate regions as shown in Figs . 4f ) to i ) with the epidemic prevalence ( shaded plots ) at dif - ferent municipalities of a same immediate region . This pattern is repeated for other federative states : only the dispersion amplitude varies . This multi - scale nature for CE , RJ , RS , and SP states are respectively provided in Figs . S4 , S5 , S6 , and S7 of the SM [ 46 ] . Variability of time , prevalence , and width τ ( outbreak duration ) of the epidemic peak throughout immediate re - gions are shown in the box plots of Fig . 5 for simulations with a weak mitigation . Box plots for none and moder - ate mitigations are qualitatively similar and presented in Figs . S8 and S9 of the SM [ 46 ] . One can see that federa - tive states with smaller territorial areas , such as SE , RN , and RJ , tend to have smaller dispersions of the peak time while those with larger and more sparsely connected ter - ritories , as AM , MT , and MS , have larger dispersions and outliers . We also have states with larger but better con - nected territories such as SP , PR , and RS , for which the dispersion is signiﬁcant but not characterized by outliers . Irrespective of the more cohesive outbreak patterns , the 7 epidemic peaks in immediate regions of the SP state , for example , could take more than twice as long as the peak at the capital city . Conversely , the outbreaks in the RJ state would be less desynchronized than in its neighbors , MG and SP , with the latest immediate region reaching the epidemic peak only 50 % later than the capital city Rio de Janeiro , in this scenario . The space - time progression of the epidemic presents complex patterns as shown in Figure 6a ) to g ) , where color maps with the prevalences of symptomatic cases in each municipality of Brazil are shown with intervals of three weeks for simulations using weak mitigation ; see Figs . S10 , and S11 of the SM [ 46 ] for other scenarios . Full evolutions for all investigated mitigation parameters are provided in Movies S1 , S2 , and S3 of the SM [ 46 ] . Epidemic waves propagating on average from the coast at east , where the most populated regions are , to in - land can be seen at a country level . Moreover , when the epidemic is losing strength in the coast , the inland re - gions are still facing high levels of epidemic prevalence . Maps and movies suggest that the epidemic starts in the more populated places , usually the largest metropolitan regions , and spreads out towards the countryside . This is quite clear in the SP state , where the focus begins in its capital city and moves westward into the countryside . However , other states as PR and RS follow a diﬀerent pattern with multiple foci evolving simultaneously . We analyzed the correlation between time T of the epi - demic peak in the prevalence curves of immediate regions and their distances D from the capital city of the respec - tive state . Figures 6i ) - k ) show scatter plots of D vs T for three typical correlation patterns found in the simu - lations . The remaining states are given in Fig . S12 of the SM [ 46 ] . The SP state presents a strong correlation with Pearson coeﬃcient r = 0 . 69 , statistically signiﬁcant with p - value less than 10 − 7 . For PR , no statistical correlation is observed . Finally , MG has a moderate correlation with Pearson coeﬃcient r = 0 . 47 , but statistically signiﬁcant with p - value of 10 − 5 . We classiﬁed the states accord - ing to the correlation between T and D in three groups : not signiﬁcant for which the p - value is larger than 0 . 02 ; strong correlation that has statistical signiﬁcance with p < 0 . 02 and r > 0 . 6 ; and moderate correlation with p < 0 . 02 and r < 0 . 6 . The results are summarized in Fig . 6h ) where the map shows states colored according to their classiﬁcation . The structure does not change for other mitigation approaches . The complete set of Pear - son coeﬃcients and p - values are given in Fig . S12 of the SM [ 46 ] . States in the north ( RR , RO , AP , AC , AM , PA , and TO ) have few immediate regions distributed in large territories and are less connected . Thus , lack of correla - tions is not surprising . Moderate correlations in states as MG , BA , and GO , with large but better connected territories are due to the existence of multiple important regions that play the role of regional capitals . However , PR is an extreme case with many and well connected immediate regions but total lack of correlations with the capital city , Curitiba . V . DISCUSSION The wide territorial , demographic , infrastructural di - versities of large countries as Brazil demand modeling of a pandemic with geographical resolution higher than the usual compartmental epidemic models , which can be achieved using the metapopulation framework . We de - veloped a stochastic metapopulation model and applied it to the COVID - 19 spreading in Brazilian municipali - ties . Performing simulations with diﬀerent hypothetical mitigation scenarios and considering the integration of regions through inter - municipality recurrent mobility , we have identiﬁed a high degree of heterogeneity and desyn - chronization of the epidemic curves between the main metropolitan areas and other inland regions . The di - versity of outcomes is observed in several geographical scales , ranging from states to immediate regions , that enclose groups of nearby municipalities with strong eco - nomic and social ties . The intenser the mitigation atti - tudes , the more remarkable are the diﬀerences . Moderate or strong correlations between the delay of the epidemic peak in the interior regions and distance to the capi - tal cities of the respective state were observed for most states with well connected immediate regions . However , one exception was the PR state where there are diverse epidemic foci evolving apparently independently of its capital city . Our simulations suggest that uniform mitigation mea - sures are not the optimal strategy . In a municipality where the peak without interventions would happen quite later than the capital city of its state , it would delay even more if strong mitigation measures are adopted syn - chronously with the capital . Nevertheless , such a place probably would have to extend the mitigation for much longer periods since once the epicenters of epidemics start to relax their restrictions , the viruses will circulate fast , reaching these vulnerable municipalities with most of population still susceptible . This is the actual current situation in Brazil at moment of resubmission . The so - cial and economic impacts could be higher . On the other hand , an eventual collapse of the local heath system , a central question of the COVID - 19 pandemic combat - ing [ 24 ] , in the countryside regions could also occur after the larger metropolitan areas were under control , rais - ing the possibility of unburdening the local healthy care system . In fact , the desynchronization of the epidemic curves and consequently of the health - system collapse could be an asset in designing optimal resource alloca - tions . One could prevent rapid expansion of the epidemic through smaller municipalities ﬂattening the curves as much as possible in the main metropolitan regions . Be - yond the positive consequences for their own health sys - tems , this attitude would have the positive side eﬀect of delaying outbreaks in the countryside . Our study shows that countryside regions are not safe in the medium - term but could have precious additional time to prepare them - selves . 8 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 30 60 90 T ( d a y s ) 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 60 90 120 T ( d a y s ) 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 D ( km ) 30 60 90 T ( d a y s ) a ) b ) c ) d ) e ) f ) g ) h ) i ) j ) k ) FIG . 6 . a - g ) Color maps presenting the evolution of the prevalence of symptomatic cases ( U and C ) for Brazil in a simulation with a weak mitigation using parameters ( M , K ) = ( 0 . 4 , 0 . 3 ) .

AFTERWORDS There is an interval of ﬁve months between conceiving the ﬁrst version of the present work [ 39 ] and this ﬁnal submission . As emphasized throughout the paper , our aim was to simulate hypothetical scenarios rather to do an accurate forecasting of real epidemic curves . There - fore , qualitative behaviors predicted in the simulations can now be confronted with the real series observed a posteriori . Several qualitative aspects predicted in sim - ulations were indeed observed in real data . Maybe the most remarkable one is the conﬁrmation of the multi - scale nature of the epidemic curves presented in Fig . 4 of the main text and Figs . S4 to S7 of SM [ 46 ] . Figure 7 presents the epidemic incidences ( new cases per capita over a week ) for intermediate regions of three states pre - senting typical behaviors observed in simulations . The scenario of propagation starting from east coast towards inland , with a considerable delay for the epidemic peak in the latter , shown in Fig . 6 was also observed . Other interesting phenomena were also veriﬁed in real data as , for example , the unusual curve for the MA state and the multifocal spreading in some states as PR , MG and GO . Lets consider in more details the SP state shown in Fig 7a ) , the one with highest number of COVID - 19 cases in Brazil . One can see a moderate dispersion for peak occurrence time while in the capital city S˜ao Paulo it happened considerably earlier . This picture is the same drawn in Fig . S7a ) of the SM [ 46 ] . For the state of RJ , shown in Fig . 7b ) , the real data , with an exception for the intermediate region of Petrop´olis , are remarkably similar to simulations ( see Fig . S5a ) of the SM [ 46 ] ) , where inter - mediate regions peaks approximately synchronously with the intermediate region of Rio de Janeiro . We are not able to provide a speciﬁc reason for the diﬀerent behav - ior of Petrop´olis . The incidence curves for the CE state , one of the ﬁrst and more intensely impacted places by COVID - 19 in Brazil and shown in Fig . 7c ) , are remark - ably heterogeneous with Fortaleza reaching the maxi - mum much earlier and Cret´eus much later than the other intermediate regions . The incidence curve for the whole CE state is very broad meaning that diﬀerent regions rule the state’ curve at diﬀerent times , a scenario in al - most perfect consonance with the simulation predictions shown in Fig . S4 of SM [ 46 ] . We can also see signiﬁcant dispersion for immediate regions’ curves within a same intermediate region , as illustrated for Sobral in Fig . 7d ) . Intermediate region of Cret´eus is composed only by two intermediate regions and does not illustrate the point as well as Sobral does . The maximum incidence also varied considerably as , once more , predicted in simulations . Quantitatively , a hypothetical scenario ﬁtting better more regions lies between weak and moderate mitiga - tions . However , as one could guess , diﬀerent hypotheti - cal scenarios works better at distinct moments and places conﬁrming that quantitative forecasting and even now - casting is a very dedicated issue . Appendix A : Computer implementation The computer implementation of the epidemic model follows the Gillespie methods based on Ref . [ 43 ] . Deﬁnitions . We deﬁne n X ji as the number of individuals in state X ( = S , E , A , U , C , or R ) within the patch i that comes from patch j such that ˜ n X i = (cid:80) j n X ji is the number of individuals in patch i that are in state X . Thus , the number of residents of i in state X at patch i is n X ii and of nonresidents is given by ˜ n X i − n X ii . Also , ˜ n i = (cid:80) X ˜ n X i is the total number of individuals and ˜ n ii = (cid:80) X ˜ n X ii the 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36 39 epidemic week 0 10 20 30 40 n e w c a s e s p e r 100 k i nh a b . a ) S˜ao Paulo SorocabaBauruMar´ıliaP .

Epidemic week 12 correspond to March 15 - 21 , 2020 . number of residents in the patch i . Finally , the total number of individuals in the compartment X is N X = (cid:80) Ω j = 1 ˜ n X i . We have that W ii = N i − (cid:80) j (cid:54) = i W ij is the population of patch i that does not leave it . The population fraction moving recurrently from i to j is R ij = W ij (cid:80) l W il . ( A1 ) Thus , R i = (cid:80) j (cid:54) = i R ij and R ii = 1 − R i are , respectively , the population fractions that move or not from patch i . General structure of the simulation . We divide the sim - ulation in two big groups : mobility and epidemic events . The total rate of inter - patch mobility is D tot = T − 1 r (cid:88) i ˜ n ii R i + T − 1 r (cid:88) i ( ˜ n i − ˜ n ii ) , ( A2 ) in which the ﬁrst term represents the individuals leaving from and the second returning to their patches of resi - dence . The epidemic transitions T and their respective total rates Γ T are deﬁned in Table I . The infection rate in a patch i is given by Θ i = k i ˜ n S i ˜ n i (cid:0) λ A ˜ n A i + λ U ˜ n U i + bλ C ˜ n C i (cid:1) , ( A3 ) while the total rate of epidemic events is E tot = (cid:80) T Γ T . In each time step , we select one mobility or epidemic TABLE I . Total transition rates for diﬀerent types of epidemic events . T Γ T T Γ T E → A µ A N E A → U β U N A A → R β R N A U → R α R N U U → C α C N U C → R α R N C S → E (cid:80) Ω i = 1 Θ i event with probabilities P mob = D tot / ( D tot + E tot ) and P epi = 1 − P mob , respectively , and the time is increased by δt = −(cid:104) δt (cid:105) ln η where (cid:104) δt (cid:105) = 1 / ( D tot + E tot ) and η is a pseudo random number uniformly distributed in the interval ( 0 , 1 ] . Inter - patch mobility events . If a mobility event was chosen we proceed as follows . i ) Choose the patch i from where an individual will leave proportionally to the total mobility rate of the patch , which occurs with probability Q i = ˜ n ii R i + ( ˜ n i − ˜ n ii ) (cid:80) j [ ˜ n jj R j + ( ˜ n j − ˜ n jj ) ] ( A4 ) ii ) Choose the state X of the individual of patch i that will move with probability P X i = ˜ n X i (cid:80) Y ˜ n Y i . ( A5 ) 10 iii ) Select if the individual to move is resident or nonresi - dent with probabilities n X ii / ˜ n X i and 1 − n X ii / ˜ n X i , respec - tively . iv ) If the individual is resident and not symptomatic ( S , E , A or R ) , the destination patch j is chosen with probability R ij / ˜ R i . If he / she is symptomatic , stays in the resident patch ( j = i ) . The movement is imple - mented as n X ij → n X ij + 1 and n X ii → n X ii − 1 . v ) If the individual to move is a nonresident , one patch j is chosen with probability n X ji / ( ˜ n X i − ˜ n X ii ) and the movement is implemented as n X ji → n X ji − 1 and n X jj → n X jj + 1 . Epidemic events . If an epidemic event was chosen we proceed as follows . i ) One of the transitions T is chosen with probability P T = Γ T (cid:80) T Γ T . ( A6 ) ii ) If T = S → E , then we choose a patch i with proba - bility Θ i / (cid:80) Ω j = 1 Θ j . Then , one patch j is chosen with probability n S ji / ˜ n S i and the populations are updated as n S ji → n S ji − 1 and n E ji → n E ji + 1 . Notice that both resident ( i = j ) or nonresident ( i (cid:54) = j ) are considered in this rule . iii ) If T is a spontaneous transition of the form X → Y then a patch i is chosen with probability ˜ n X i / N X and the patch j of residence is chosen with probability n X ji / ˜ n X i . Then n X ji → n X ji − 1 and n Y ji → n Y ji + 1 . This algorithm spends too much time with mobility of susceptible and removed individuals since they can exist in very large number for long times . We implemented an optimization performing the mobility of susceptible and removed in discrete times of 0 . 5 d . So , instead of moving one susceptible individual at a time step , we move n S ii R ij from i to j at once and those who were not infected while visiting patch j , return to i after 0 . 5 d . The same is done for removed individuals . The simulations yield the same results as the exact procedure within the statistical uncertainties . Appendix B : Parameters for a data - driven approach Mobility . Mobility parameters were extracted from public sources . Local commuting C ( 1 ) ij was estimated from the national census data of 2010 provided by IBGE [ 52 ] as the number of people that daily commute among municipalities to work or study . We excluded from the dataset those travels corresponding to more than 250 km , which are reckoned by airline travel data . Commuting data lacking destinations were included , as - suming proportionality to the complete - information por - tion of the dataset ; see [ 53 ] for details . For the sake of generality , the recurrent ﬂux is a function W ( 1 ) ij = F ij ( C ( 1 ) ij ) . We use the simplest case F ij ( x ) = x . Air transportation data were obtained from the Agˆencia Na - cional de Avia¸c˜ao Civil ( ANAC ) [ 54 ] with the statis - tics of direct ﬂights of 2014 considering the main nearby metropolitan region as the origin and destination of pas - sengers . Using boarding and landing statistics of passen - gers , one - connection ﬂights were inferred and the num - ber of passengers C ( 2 ) ij ﬂying daily from i to j was esti - mated [ 55 ] . In order to construct a recurrent mobility with ﬂights , we assume W ( 2 ) ij = ( C ( 2 ) ij + C ( 2 ) ji ) / 2 , which represents an eﬀective ﬂux . We do not have estimates for duration of long - range travels . However , this does not aﬀect the current model since the homogeneous mix - ing hypothesis within the patches means that only the number of individuals that stay part of the time in two diﬀerent patches actually matters and not who traveled . The total recurrent mobility is W ij = W ( 1 ) ij + W ( 2 ) ij ; we assume that it occurs daily , i . e , T r = 1 d since both com - muting and air travel data were obtained with this time resolution . Epidemiological parameters . We used epidemiological parameters based on Ref . [ 24 ] which were mined from analyses of early COVID - 19 epidemic spreading on Hubei province China [ 17 , 20 , 23 ] . The total time in the ex - posed and asymptomatic compartments was taken as µ − 1A + β − 1U = 5 . 2 d [ 17 ] . We used µ − 1A = β − 1U = 2 . 6 d . The time for a symptomatic individual be removed was estimated as α − 1 R = 3 . 2 d [ 20 , 23 ] . For the truly asymp - tomatic individuals , we used the same recovering time of the presymptomatic ones , such that β − 1R = β − 1U + α − 1R . The infection rates λ C = λ U = λ A = 0 . 06 d − 1 [ 13 , 24 , 56 ] and average number of contacts (cid:104) k (cid:105) = 13 were estimated to reproduce the scaling of Brazilian very early exponen - tial growth , ∼ exp ( 0 . 3 t ) , in reported cases of COVID - 19 ; see Fig . S13 in the SM [ 46 ] . These parameters provide an eﬀective infection rate λ (cid:104) k (cid:105) = 0 . 78 that represents an op - timistic estimate nearer to the lower bounds estimated in other studies of COVID - 19 [ 20 , 23 , 24 , 57 ] . The contact of the individuals who were conﬁrmed for COVID - 19 was depleted to a fraction b = 0 . 3 of their regular contacts . The conﬁrmation rate 1 / α ( 0 ) C = 10 d was calibrated to - gether with the initial conditions to ﬁt the amplitude of conﬁrmed case curves after 31 March 2020 and also the total number of municipalities with conﬁrmed cases in a weak mitigation scenario . This is approximately twice the incubation time implying that symptomatic individ - uals may not be tested even if tests are available . Up to 23 April 2020 , Brazil had performed less than 1400 tests per million inhabitants [ 38 ] . Assuming a time window of 35 d for testing , we have approximately ζ = 1 / 40 000 d − 1 per inhabitant . Due to the testing targeted only to severe cases of respiratory syndromes adopted in Brazil to the date of investigation , the transition from asymp - 11 tomatic to conﬁrmed was neglected setting β C = 0 ; note that the model can easily include such a transition if the testing scenario changes . Demographic parameters . Each patch represents a mu - nicipality with resident population given by IBGE us - ing estimates of 2019 [ 35 ] , while the respective fractions of rural and urban populations were obtained from the IBGE census of 2010 [ 52 ] . The population density was determined using urban areas , obtained from high reso - lution satellite images , provided by Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecu´aria ( EMBRAPA ) [ 58 ] . Both frac - tion and density of urban population , and , consequently , the number of contacts have broad distributions as can be seen in Fig . S13 of the SM [ 46 ] . These are key features to enhance the accuracy of the predictions be - yond large metropolitan centers . Parameter a that con - trols the function f ( x ) was taken as a = 1 / (cid:104) ξ (cid:105) where (cid:104) ξ (cid:105) = 2791 inhabitants / km 2 is the average urban popu - lation density of Brazil . The rural - urban contact matrix was chosen as C uu = C rr = 1 and C ru = 0 . 5 . This last choice only assumes that urban - rural contacts are signif - icantly smaller than urban - urban or rural - rural interac - tions . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Marcelo F . C .
