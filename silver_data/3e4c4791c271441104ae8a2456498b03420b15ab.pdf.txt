We used all - atom 2 - dimensional well - tempered metadynamics computer simulations to sample the release of phosphate from filaments with unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to study residues that gate release . Dissociation of phosphate from Mg 2 + is rate limiting and associated with an energy barrier of 20 kcal / mol , consistent with experimental rates of phosphate release . Phosphate then diffuses in an internal cavity toward a gate formed by R177 recognized in prior computational studies and cryo - EM structures . The gate is closed when R177 hydrogen bonds with N111 and is open when R177 forms a salt bridge with D179 . Most of the time interactions of R177 with other residues 2 occludes the phosphate release pathway . Machine learning analysis reveals that the occluding interactions fluctuate rapidly . These occluded states have not yet been documented in cryo - EM reconstructions . ( 150 words ) Significance Statement The protein actin assembles into filaments that participate in muscle contraction and other cellular movements . An ATP bound to the actin monomer is hydrolyzed rapidly during filament assembly , but the γ - phosphate dissociates slowly from the filament . We used molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the slow release process . Separation of phosphate from Mg 2 + in the active site is rate limiting owing to a large free energy barrier 20 kcal / mol . Release of phosphate from the protein requires opening a gate in the actin molecule formed by interaction of the sidechains of arginine 177 and asparagine 111 . Surprisingly , the simulations revealed other interactions of the sidechain of arginine 177 that occlude the release pathway most of the time but have not been observed in cryo - EM structures . ( 124 words ) Introduction Living cells recycle actin molecules countless times by assembly and disassembly of filaments that they use for cellular movements and physical support of the cell and its plasma membrane . During each cycle of assembly , actin molecules with bound Mg - ATP from the cytoplasm ( 1 ) incorporate at one of the two ends of a filament ( largely the fast - growing “barbed” end ) ( 2 ) and undergo a conformational change that flattens the twisted actin monomer ( 3 - 5 ) . Flattening repositions residues in the active site and activates the ATPase activity of the subunit about 42 , 000 - fold ( 6 , 7 ) with a half time of 2 s , producing ADP and an H 2 PO 4 – ion , henceforth called phosphate ( P i ) , to form an intermediate , Mg - ADP - P i - actin . The reaction occurs by either a dissociative pathway , where the ß - g - phosphate bond breaks prior to the addition of lytic water , or a concerted mechanism , where the g - phosphate bond breaks concurrently with the addition of lytic water ( 6 , 8 - 15 ) . Although hydrolysis releases free energy , the structures of ATP - and Mg - ADP - P i - actin subunits are identical ( 4 ) . The free g - phosphate escapes into solution very slowly with a half time of 6 min ( 16 ) . Filaments with ADP - actin subunits differ those with ATP or ADP - P i - actin subunits in stiffness , ( 17 - 21 ) affinities for regulatory proteins such as cofilin , ( 22 , 23 ) and the response to stresses ( 24 , 25 ) . 3 In spite of ever higher resolution structures of actin filaments , now extending to < 2 . 5 Å resolution ( 26 , 27 ) , the mechanism of slow phosphate release is still in question . Wriggers and Schulten ( 28 ) concluded from steered molecular dynamics ( SMD ) simulations that phosphate is released from monomeric actin by a pathway from the active site to a “backdoor” near methylhistidine HIC73 in subdomain 1 ( SD1 ) . They limited their analysis to an assumed a predefined pathway and applied an external force to pull phosphate along to exit actin . Along this path the phosphate interacts with several residues including S14 , G74 , G158 , H161 and V159 . The rate limiting step in their simulations was dissociation of phosphate from the divalent cation in the active site , assumed to be Ca 2 + rather than the physiological Mg 2 + . Cryo - EM structures of actin filaments with bound AMPPNP ( an ATP analog ) - , ADP - P i - , and ADP - actin filaments nucleotides suggested a possible exit gate formed by R177 , N111 , and HIC73 , which was closed in the ADP - P i - actin structure and open in the ADP - actin structure . A possible mechanism is that as phosphate dissociates from the Mg 2 + ion , a hydrogen bond ( H - bond ) between S14 and G74 breaks making SD2 more flexible and favoring rotation of the side chain of HIC - 73 to open the exit gate . On the other hand , the N111 - R177 exit gate was closed in higher resolution cryo - EM structures of ADP - P i - , and ADP - actin filaments ( 26 , 27 ) . We use well - tempered metadynamics ( WT - MetaD ) ( 29 - 32 ) biased free energy sampling and unbiased molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations to investigate the release of P i from Mg - ADP - P i - actin filaments . We find a 20 . 5 kcal / mol free energy barrier associated with breaking the bond between Mg 2 + and the H 2 PO 4 – ion , which is in good agreement with the experimental time scale for P i release according to a simple transition state theory estimate . Once free from Mg 2 + , P i diffuses through an internal cavity to a gate formed by the side chain of R177 in subdomain 3 . Three different hydrogen bonding interactions of R177 explain the three different states of channel connected to the exterior . Formation of a hydrogen - bond between the side chains of R177 and N111 in subdomain 1 closes the gate . Alternately , the sidechain of R177 can bend toward the interior of the protein and form hydrogen bonds with H161 and P109 , which also occludes the channel . Formation of a hydrogen bond with H73 and a salt bridge with D179 opens the gate on the channel . During unbiased MD simulations , actin spends most of the time in the occluded state but also visits the closed and open states . The residence time in the occluded and closed states slows phosphate release , but it is not the rate - limiting step in our simulations . 4 Results Preparation of a pentameric ADP - P i actin filament for MD simulations . We used both well - tempered metadynamics ( WT - MetaD ) and unbiased MD simulations to investigate the release of P i from a subunit in a short , ADP - P i - actin filament with five subunits named from the barbed end A0 - A4 ( Fig . 1A ) . We focused on the middle subunit A 2 within the accessible time in all the simulations . We prepared these pentamers as follows : Starting a 13 - subunit section of the Chou ( 4 ) cryo - EM structure of the ADP - P i - actin filament ( PDB 6DJN ) , Zsolnay et al . carried out computational solvation and equilibration ( 33 ) , which produced a filament with altered subunits on the ends and a core of conventional subunits in the occluded state ( defined below ) with helical parameters similar to the cryo - EM structure . We took five conventional subunits from the core of the 13 - mer filament and further equilibrated the system with energy minimization and a 10 ns simulation with a constant number of particles , pressure , temperature ( NPT ) ( Fig 1A ) . This resulted in flattening of the terminal subunits at the barbed end and partially twisting the of the terminal subunits at the pointed end . The central subunit A2 was flattened with an occluded phosphate release pathway , described in detail below . We used this structure as the initial structure in the unconstrained MD simulations . The altered conformations of the subunits flanking subunit A2 may influence the release of phosphate , so we carried out four additional constrained simulations with restraints to maintain the flattened state of the terminal subunits flanking the central subunit . The initial structure for the constrained simulations was prepared by using steered MD to drive all the subunits into the flattened state ( as detailed in the Methods section , with subsequent WT - MetaD results given in the Supplementary Materials ) . Well Tempered - MetaD simulations . During WT - MetaD simulations , the dihedral angles of all five subunits were more stable in restrained pentamer , with the central subunit A2 remaining flattened like a subunit in the core of an actin filament ( Fig . 1C ) . In four independent simulations of unrestrained and four simulations of restrained filaments , phosphate used similar pathways to move from the active site next to the ß - phosphate of ADP out of the protein next to R177 , commonly called the " backdoor " pathway ( Fig . 1B ) . Furthermore , the potentials of mean force ( PMFs , i . e . , free energy curves ) as a function of the distance between P i and the Mg 2 + ion were similar in the restrained and unrestrained filaments ( Fig . 1D ) . This results section therefore 5 focuses on simulations with unrestrained subunits but also notes similar results of simulations with retrained subunits . The potential of mean force as phosphate is released by the “backdoor” pathway . We calculated the potential of mean force ( PMF ) as a function of the distance between P i and the Mg 2 + ion in the active site by averaging the free energy profiles of 6 independent unbinding trajectories for both the unrestrained and restrained filaments ( Fig . 1C ) . The error bars in Fig . 1 ( d ) are standard errors representing the uncertainty in the PMF measurements . The small variability indicates consistency between different simulation trials , whose energy profiles are separately shown in Supplementary Fig . S1 . The small variance between individual release trajectories and PMF also suggests that the P i release pathway is stable . Moreover , the gentle biasing potential that we added to the system did not introduce any artifact or spurious mechanism in the simulations . The plot in Fig . 1D reveals two energy barriers in the release pathway : a high barrier of ~ 20 . 5 kcal / mol close to the bound state , and another of ~ 5 . 0 kcal / mol near the unbound state . Furthermore , the PMF profile is quite similar in the simulations with restrained subunits . The difference between the PMFs from unrestrained and restrained systems is within the simulation error . Based on the positions of these energy barriers in the PMF , phosphate proceeds in three distinct stages . Stage 1 , breaking the coordination between P i and Mg 2 + . The first step of the release process involves the loss of coordination between phosphate and the Mg 2 + ion , which is associated with the energy barrier located close in distance from the bound state in Fig . 1D . The deep energy basin at the bound state indicates strong interaction between P i and Mg 2 + . In addition to the coordination between P i and Mg 2 + , our simulations revealed stabilizing interactions between P i in the nucleotide - binding site and the protein . P i forms hydrogen bonds with S14 and Q137 in the initial equilibrium structure ( Fig . 2D ) . During the simulations , Q137 adopted a new rotameric state ( Fig 2E ) to form hydrogen bonds with the side chain of H136 reoriented away from the P i . The distance between P i and Mg 2 + increased only after disruption of the interaction between Q137 and P i ( Supplementary Fig . S2 and Supplementary Video 1 ) . The coordination between water molecules and P i changed in both unbiased and WT - MetaD simulations . The number of waters coordinated with Mg 2 + was estimated using a 6 continuous switch function with a 3 Å cutoff ( see Supplementary Materials for more details ) . On the time scale of the unbiased MD simulations , the coordination number fluctuates in a relatively wide range ( 2 . 3 ~ 4 . 2 ) ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . Figs . 2B and 2 C illustrate the cases in simulations where Mg 2 + coordinates with three or four water molecules . Fig . 2A compares the PMF of the P i - Mg 2 + distance with the water coordination number of Mg 2 + calculated from one WT - metaD trajectory . The PMF profile has a deep energy well at a P i - Mg 2 + distance of 3 . 4 Å with 3 . 2 waters coordinated with Mg 2 + , indicating the most stable bound structure for P i . Phosphate and Mg 2 + dissociate above the high energy barrier at separations greater than 4 . 3 Å . At a coordination of ≥4 . 2 waters the coordination between P i and Mg 2 + breaks , allowing the separation of P i and Mg 2 + . This mechanism was observed in all simulated trajectories ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . Stage 2 , diffusion in the cavity . After leaving the nucleotide - binding site , P i diffuses in a cavity ( Fig . 3B ) , which we delinated by probing with a detection radius of 4 . 2 Å , comparable in size to phosphate ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . ADP and Mg 2 + occupy one end of the “C” - shaped cavity with the R177 gate at the other end ( Fig . 3B ) . In between phosphate diffuses between the sensor loop ( residues 71 – 77 ) and residues E107 and A108 , where it can form hydrogen bonds with the backbone atoms of G74 and A108 ( Fig . 3C ) . The relatively flat free energy profile after the breaking the coordination between Mg 2 + and P i indicates a lack of strong interactions during this stage ( Fig . 1 ( c ) ) . Stage 2 , diffusion in the cavity . After leaving the nucleotide - binding site , P i diffuses in a cavity ( Fig . 3B ) , which we delineated by probing with a detection radius of 4 . 2 Å , comparable in size to phosphate ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . ADP and Mg 2 + occupy one end of the “C” - shaped cavity with the R177 gate at the other end ( Fig . 3B ) . In between phosphate diffuses between the sensor loop ( residues 71 – 77 ) and residues E107 and A108 , where it can form hydrogen bonds with the backbone atoms of G74 and A108 ( Fig . 3C ) . The relatively flat free energy profile after the breaking the coordination between Mg 2 + and P i indicates a lack of strong interactions during this stage ( Fig . 1C ) . 7 Stage 3 , opening the backdoor . To exit the actin subunit , P i must overcome a second barrier thought to be formed at least in part by the side chain of R177 . In cryo - EM structures ( PDB 6DJN , 8A2S , 8D17 ) , the side chain of R177 forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of N111 and H161 , and the backbone of P109 , creating a barrier to P i release ( Fig . 4A , Table 2 ) . This has been called the R177 closed state . Crystal structures of actin monomers ( 34 ) and a cryo - EM structure of the pointed end of the ADP - actin filament ( 35 ) have the gate open with a salt bridge between R177 and the sidechain of D179 but no hydrogen bonds with N111 or P109 ( Fig . 4E , Table 2 ) . This is the open state . Our WT - MetaD and long unbiased MD simulations showed that the hydrogen - bonding interactions of R177 with HIC73 , P109 , N111 , H161 and D179 fluctuate on a nanosecond ( ns ) time scale , visiting not only the open and closed states defined above but also multiple configurations that also block phosphate release without a hydrogen bond between R177 and N111 ( Figs . 4C - D , Table 2 ) . We call these configurations occluded states . We used free energy profiles ( Fig . 5C ) to choose the cutoffs for the bonding distances to define four states of the phosphate gate based on distances between the side chains . The distance between two residues is determined as the distance between the closest pair of atoms involved in the formation of a hydrogen bond or a salt bridge . The specific atoms participating in these interactions can be found in Table 2 , and a more detailed definition is provided in the Supplementary Materials . Trajectories of unbiased MD simulations show how the protein fluctuates among these three states : closed D occluded D open ( Figs . 5A - B ) . Closed state : In the closed state , the distance between R177 and N111 ( D R177 - N111 ) is < 3 . 53 Å and R177 also forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone of P109 . Fig . 4A shows these hydrogen bonds and Fig . 4B shows that molecular surfaces occlude the channel for phosphate release . Open state : The distances of R177 to its potential hydrogen - bonding partners are D R177 - P109 > 3 . 8 Å , D R177 - HIC73 > 3 . 57 Å , D R177 - H161 > 3 . 66 Å and D R177 - D179 < 3 . 40 Å ( Fig . 4E ) . Without a hydrogen bond between N111 and R177 , N111 is reoriented to hydrogen bond with E107 and located further from R177 , accounting for much of the separation . Thus , in the open state R177 forms a salt bridge with D179 but does not form hydrogen bonds with P109 , H73 or H161 and leaves open the pore for phosphate to escape ( Fig . 4F and Supplementary Video 2 ) . 8 Wide - open state : In this configuration with D R177 - N111 > 13 . 7 Å and R177 forms a salt bridge with D179 . In both the open and wide - open states the back door is open , creating a pore larger than the size of phosphate between the interior and exterior of the actin subunit ( Fig . 4F ) . In our simulations P i consistently moved towards the side chain of R177 as it exited from the protein and was fully released ( Fig . 4D and Supplementary Video 2 ) . This is likely an electrostatic interaction between negatively charged P i and positively charged R177 as shown by the charge distribution in Fig . 4F . Occluded states : We define the occluded state as all configurations of the R177 hydrogen - bonding network other than the three states defined above . These include states with one or more rapidly fluctuating hydrogen - bonds between R177 and HIC73 , P109 and / or H161 but not an electrostatic interaction with D179 ( Fig . 5C - D ) . N111 forms a hydrogen bond with E107 rather than R177 . Analysis of the molecular surfaces shows that the pathway for phosphate between the interior cavity and the exterior of the actin subunit is blocked ( Fig . 4B ) . During both types of MD simulations starting in the occluded state , the occluded state is the most heavily populated . However , the subunits in available cryo - EM structures of filaments are either in the closed or open states ( Table 2 ) . To investigate whether freezing during preparation for cryo - EM might reconfigure the R177 hydrogen - bonding network , we changed the temperature during unbiased simulations . Starting in the closed state , lowering the temperature from 322°K to 77°K over 40 ns or alternating the temperature between 322° K to 77° K ( a common strategy for finding states with minimal energy ) did not change the hydrogen bonds of R177 ( Figs . 6B - C ) . Starting with the occluded state , the distance between R177 and N111 decreased ( Fig . 6D ) , indicating a transition towards the closed state . These simulations suggest that the closed state is more stable than the occluded state at lower temperatures and may explain the absence of the occluded state in frozen samples . Additional occluded and wide - open states . Both types of MD simulations revealed a dynamic hydrogen - bonding network in the phosphate release channel giving rise to multiple metastable states that may be difficult to define based solely on cryo - EM structures and by inspection of that data . To search for overlooked or more obscure states we used a machine learning method called 9 state predictive information bottleneck ( SPIB ) ( 36 ) to identify metastable states automatically from the high - dimensional MD trajectories . SPIB builds upon the Information Bottleneck ( IB ) principle ( 37 ) and aims to derive a concise yet informative representation of an input source with respect to a target variable . Notably , SPIB incorporates a dynamic learning process during training , enabling the acquisition of a discrete - state representation of the system . We calculated the pairwise distances between atoms from R177 and other residues ( listed in Table 3 ) from the unbiased trajectories for use as the input for SPIB to learn the discrete - state representation . SPIB defined not only the single closed and open states we identified based on cryo - EM structures , but also identified multiple substates corresponding to the occluded and wide - open states defined by our inspection ( Supplementary Table . S1 ) . Specifically , SPIB state 1 closely matched our definition of the closed state , exhibiting the same hydrogen bond network . None of the SPIB states 3 - 6 had a hydrogen bond between R177 and N111 or the salt bridge between R177 and D179 , so they align with our occluded conformations . SPIB states 8 and 9 defined by SPIB also agree with our definition of the wide - open conformation with the D R177 - N111 > 13 . 7 Å and R177 forms a salt bridge with D179 . Two of the states identified by SPIB ( 2 and 7 ) were mixtures of conformations from two of our states . Among the conformations belonging to SPIB state 2 , around half are the open state as we defined ( D R177 - P109 > 3 . 8 Å , D R177 - HIC73 > 3 . 57 Å , D R177 - H161 > 3 . 66 Å and D R177 - D179 < 3 . 40 Å ) . The other half of the SPIB state 2 conformations are occluded states . Similarly , in SPIB state 7 about half of the conformations belong in the occluded state , while the other half belong to the wide - open state . The fast transitions among these conformations may explain why SPIB groups them together in states 2 and 7 . Transitions among the four states of the gate . During long unbiased MD simulations , hydrogen bonds between R177 and formed and dissociated on a nanosecond time scale ( Figs . 5A , 5B ) . Transitions from the closed state to the open state and back always involve the occluded state as the intermediate . Thus , the closed state only transits to the occluded state . The occluded state is the most heavily populated and rarely transits to the closed or open state , so it dominates in blocking phosphate release . The open state is four times more likely to transit to the occluded 10 state than the wide - open state , while the wide - open state has similar probabilities of transiting to the open and the occluded state . Discussion The release of phosphate ( P i ) from ADP - P i - actin filaments is a critical step in the polymerization cycle of actin . We used enhanced free energy sampling methods and all - atom MD simulations to investigate the mechanism of P i release from internal ADP - P i subunits in actin filaments at the atomic level . We confirmed previous studies proposing a " back door " route for P i release ( 4 , 28 ) and characterized the energy barriers along the pathway . Our WT - MetaD and unbiased MD simulations revealed that P i release is a three - step process involving two energy barriers and four main states of the release pathway . Dissociation of phosphate from Mg 2 + . The high barrier associated with dissociation of phosphate from Mg 2 + determines the overall slow rate of the reaction . Initially , the change in coordination between Mg 2 + and water molecules , along with the conformational changes near the nucleotide - binding site , destabilizes the interaction between Mg 2 + and P i , leading to the dissociation of P i . This process makes the largest contribution to the overall PMF for the pathway and only occurs after disruption of the interaction between phosphate and Q137 . Experimentally , after hydrolysis , dissociation of inorganic phosphate proceeds at a rate of 0 . 003 s - 1 ( 38 ) for interior subunits at room temperature . Assuming that subunit flattening increases ATP - hydrolysis 40 , 000 fold ( 6 , 7 ) , and subunits at the barbed end are progressively flattened as they acquire neighboring subunits ( 33 ) , most of the phosphate release reactions occur in interior subunits at the barbed end . This slow rate implies an energy barrier of ~ 21 kcal / mol , assuming a transmission coefficient of unity in the Eyring transition state theory equation . In our simulations , an energy barrier of 20 . 5 ± 0 . 6 kcal / mol separates the P i - Mg bound state from the P i - Mg unbound state , the highest energy barrier during the release process . The agreement between this quantity and the experimentally derived energy barrier provides strong evidence that the breaking of coordination between Mg 2 + and P i is the rate - limiting step during P i release . Other interactions in the active site accompany the dissociation of P i from Mg 2 + , including rearrangement of several residues to disrupt their interactions with P i and the coordination between Mg 2 + and water molecules . These factors collectively contribute to the high energy barrier in the PMF profile for the P i release . 11 We were unable to simulate the reverse process , rebinding of P i to the active site , due to the high entropy barrier that must be overcome . Therefore , we followed work using similar methods to study ligand unbinding ( 39 - 42 ) , and refer to the free energy profiles obtained from these simulations as an approximate potential of mean force , PMF . Although specialized methods can be used to overcome this limitation ( 43 ) , further research is needed to explore this possibility in - depth . Mugnai and Thirumalai reported a stepwise hydration of Mg 2 + in their simulation of phosphate release from a myosin motor and suggested that this is a universal mechanism to trigger the release of phosphate ( 44 ) . In our simulations , the coordination number of water molecules around Mg 2 + fluctuates on a relatively short time scale , but the release of P i only occurs when four water molecules coordinate with the magnesium ion . Internal movements of phosphate and fluctuations in the gate controlling phosphate release . After dissociation from Mg 2 + , P i diffuses through a channel near HIC73 in subdomain 1 ( SD1 ) of the actin subunit , where it encounters a second , lower energy barrier associated with the transition of the R177 gate from the occluded state to the open state to release phosphate . The exit gate is closed or occluded most of the time , but when the protein fluctuates into the open state , P i moves towards the R177 gate and dissociates from the protein . During four 1 µs unbiased MD simulations , the R177 gate opened multiple times ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . We did not observe multiple transitions between all metastable states in the MD time courses in Fig . 4 G , suggesting that none of these simulations achieved complete sampling of conformational probability of the backdoor gate . These dynamics are also reflected in the relatively low energy barrier for the final stage of the release process on the PMF profile ( Fig . 1D ) . Therefore , opening and closing the backdoor gate may affect the relative rate of P i release from the actin subunits in different confirmations along the filament but does not determine the overall slow rate of P i release . The occluded state revealed by our MD simulations dominates structure in the filament . In the occluded state , R177 does not hydrogen bond with N111 , its partner in the closed state . Instead , R177 participates in a rapidly rearranging network of hydrogen bonds stabilizing conformations that block the pathway for phosphate to dissociate from actin . Remarkably , this state is not captured by current cryo - EM data . However , the occluded state may rearrange to the closed state during freezing . 12 Comparisons with other work . A preprint recently posted by Oosterheert et al . ( 45 ) reported MD simulations to investigate the mechanism of phosphate release from internal subunits in ADP - P i - actin filaments . They used an enhanced sampling protocol to explore possible pathways of phosphate release and identified pathways with gates formed by R177 or R183 . Using WT - MetaD , we found that the R177 backdoor pathway is the dominant pathway for P i release , consistent with Oosterheert’s mutagenesis and biochemical experiments and MD simulations of similar systems by others ( 28 , 44 ) . We did not observe phosphate trajectories toward R183 , which may have been produced by conventional MetaD , depending on the reaction coordinates chosen ( 46 ) . Incomplete sampling noted above may explain why shorter unbiased MD simulations reported by Oosterheert et al . did not sample the fully open state of the backdoor gate ( 45 ) . Oosterheert et al . also report the breaking the R177 and N111 hydrogen bond in shorter unbiased MD simulations , but the full opening of R177 was only observed in their steered MD simulation where they drove the configuration of the central subunit to the barbed - end configuration . Thus , the fully open state has a lower probability than other metastable states , but it is accessible by unbiased MD . Oosterheert et al . reported a 3 . 6 Å resolution reconstruction of the barbed end of an ADP - actin filament with the backdoors on the internal subunits closed by hydrogen bonds between R177 and N111 . However , rearrangement of the hydrogen bonding network of the terminal subunit left a 5 Å gap between residues N111 and R177 , which may allow phosphate release . Instead , N111 interacts with E107 . It is noteworthy that we include a quantitative calculation of the large energy barrier for water - assisted dissociation of phosphate from Mg 2 . This value agrees with the overall rate of phosphate release from actin filaments , so we conclude that it is the rate limiting step in the pathway . Oosterheert et al . did not calculate energy barriers , so they were unaware of this point and concluded “…the P i release rate from F - actin is controlled by steric hindrance through the backdoor rather than by the disruption of the ionic bond between P i and Mg 2 + at the nucleotide - binding site . ” Summary . Our study provides new insights into the mechanism of P i release from actin filaments at an atomic level as well as a quantitative identification of the rate limiting step . Our findings may also have important implications for understanding how actin filaments function in 13 various cellular processes such as cell motility and cytokinesis . The results further demonstrate the ongoing value of enhanced sampling methods combined with all - atom MD simulations and machine learning for investigating complex biomolecular processes at the atomic level . Methods and Materials System and simulation setup The system was constructed using a 5 - mer section of interior subunits from the ADP - Pi 13 - mer simulations performed in Zsolnay PNAS 2020 with an updated Charmm36m force field ( 47 ) and phosphate parameters generated with cgenff ( 48 ) . To generate the 13 - mer system in Zsolnay PNAS 2020 , 13 ADP - P i - F - actin subunits ( PDB 6DJN ) were patterned according to the rise and twist parameters reported in Chou & Pollard ( PNAS 2019 ) . The system was solvated using the autosolvate plugin in VMD ( 49 ) to add a TIP3P water box with a minimum separation of 11 Å between the protein and the periodic boundary . The autoionize plugin in VMD was used to neutralize the system and bring the solvent to a salt concentration of 100 mM KCl . The system was minimized , heated , and equilibrated with a series of constraints detailed in Zsolnay PNAS 2020 . The system underwent a 320 ns unconstrained equilibration . To construct the 5 - mer system , five subunits from the interior of the 13 - mer system ( subunits 5 to 9 ) were selected after the unconstrained equilibration of 320 ns . All water molecules within 8 Å of the subunits were included in the selection . Autosolvate and autoionize were used to fill the remainder of the solvation box to guarantee a separation of 11 Å between the protein and the periodic boundary and a neutral system with 100 mM KCl . The initial structure was subjected to energy minimization and the minimization was terminated when the maximum force is smaller than 1000 . 0 kJ / mol / nm . After energy minimization , the system was equilibrated with an NPT ensemble for 10 ns with a 2 fs integration step . The Parrinello - Rahman barostat ( 50 ) and Bussi - Parrinello velocity rescaling thermostat ( 51 ) were used to simulate the constant NPT ensemble at temperature 310 K and pressure 1 bar . The conformations of the terminal subunits at both ends changed during this process . All simulations used to study the release process were performed with the same constant NPT ensemble . Simulations were performed by using GROMACS 2020 . 4 compiled with PLUMED 2 . 4 . The data generated from the simulations were analyzed by VMD ( 49 ) , PyMol ( 52 - 54 ) and Python library MDanalysis ( 55 , 56 ) , and an in - house Python script . 14 We define the four subdomains of an actin molecule as : subdomain 1 ( SD1 ) : residues 1 to 32 , 70 to 144 , and 338 to 375 ; ( SD2 ) : residue 33 to 69 ; ( SD3 ) : residue 145 to 180 , 270 to 337 ; ( SD4 ) : residue 181 to 269 . The center of mass of the Cα atoms of each subdomain were used to compute a dihedral angle SD2 - SD1 - SD3 - SD4 . Metadynamics simulation The timescale for the release of P i , which occurs over several minutes , is orders of magnitude longer than the timescale accessible through MD simulations , which typically run on the microsecond scale at best . To overcome this limitation and sample this rare event , we used WT - MetaD ( 29 - 32 ) to accelerate the release process . Unlike a conventional metadynamics ( MetaD ) simulation , which has convergence issues , WT - MetaD decreases the height of Gaussian bias according to the existing biasing potential and has demonstrated convergence properties ( 30 , 49 ) . The choice of reaction coordinates is critical for the success of MetaD simulations . MetaD can enhance the sampling of rare events only when chosen reaction coordinates ( or collective variables , CVs ) provide a good representation of the process of interest . In this study , we employed two reaction coordinates to perform our WT - MetaD simulation : the distance between Mg 2 + and the center of mass ( COM ) of P i , denoted as d Mg - Pi , and the distance between the COM of the backbone R177 and the COM of P i . denoted as d R177 - Pi . The selection of these reaction coordinates was informed by both general intuition and previous studies of phosphate release . The cryo - EM structure indicates that the position of Mg 2 + does not change after the release of P i . Therefore , the distance between Mg 2 + and P i can be considered a good reaction coordinate as it indicates how far P i is from its binding position . The equilibrium structure from an unbiased MD simulation presents a cavity inside the central actin subunit ( Fig . 3 ) . The cavity has the shape of a channel with the side chain R177 situated at its end in the closed state . It is natural to expect that after breaking the coordination with Mg 2 + , P i can diffuse in the cavity . Previous studies based on structure also indicate the important role of R177 in the release process . These factors motivated us to use the P i - R177 distance , which is defined as the COM of P i and the COM the backbone of R177 , as the second RC . To make the RC less noisy , we only considered the backbone of R177 and avoided accounting for the fluctuation of its side chain . 15 To estimate the free energy profile ( i . e . , PMF ) , we took the approach suggested in Ref . ( 31 ) where the samples with microscopic coordinate ' from WT - MetaD is each associated with a reweighting factor : ) ( ' ) = - ! ( # ( $ ) , ' ) ( ) ( ' ) ( 2 ) Where . ( / ) is the bias 0 ( 1 ) is usually referred to as a time - dependent bias offset . The term 0 ( 1 ) can be estimated “on the fly” in the MetaD using the form : 0 ( 1 ) = ∫ 34 [ - * ! ( # , ' + ∆ ' ) / . ! / − - * ! ( # , ' ) / . ! / ] ( 3 ) where Δ t is the time interval between successive bias depositions . The unbiased estimation of an observable can be calculated as : 〈9 ( ' ) 〉 01234 # 56 = 〈8 ( $ ) 9 ( $ ) 〉 " # $ % & ' 〈9 ( $ ) 〉 " # $ % & ' ( 4 ) Next , the PMF can be calculated by ; ( / ) = − < ; = > ? 〈 @ ( / − / ( ' ) ) 〉 01234 # 56 . Noted that since here / can be any observable and is not necessary to be the reaction coordinate 4 , the free energy profiles of other variables of interest can also be obtained . The choice of MetaD parameters of a WT - MetaD simulation includes the biasing factor , biasing frequency and bias height and the variance of the Gaussian bias . In our simulations , the biasing factor was set to be 10 , the bias height was set to be 1 kcal / mol and the biasing frequency is set to be 5000 MD steps . These parameters were chosen to ensure that the biasing potential was not added too aggressively while still being able to accelerate the release process . The variances of Gaussian bias were set to be 0 . 05 Å and 0 . 5 Å separately for d Pi - Mg and d Pi - R177 and these values were determined by half of the variance of these variables in a 50 ns unbiased MD simulation .

Orange stars indicate energy basins , and green shaded areas depict regions where hydrogen bonds or salt bridges form between corresponding residue pairs .

For example , the R177 - N111 distance has three distinct basins in the energy landscape . The basin around 2 . 5 Å , is associated with the hydrogen bond between R177 and N111 . The other basins at 8 . 5 Å and 16 . 0 Å represent interactions that stabilize the system such as hydrogen bonds with other residues . Fig . 6 .

( " ) # 1 − ' ( ! ( " ) $ % ! ∈ ' Here r 0 is set to be 3 Å and the summation is over all atoms of water molecules . Distance between residues H - bonds can form between distinct atom pairs from two residues during the course of a simulation . To characterize the H - bonds networks between residues , we monitored the smallest distance between atoms that participate in forming hydrogen and electrostatic bonds . The distance between two residues I and J reported in our study is defined by : * ( ) * = , - . + ∈ ( , - ∈ * / + ) - Where / + ) - is the distance between atom i and j , which belong to residue I and J separately and participate in forming H - bonds ( listed in Table 2 ) . Transition probability between different conformations of backdoor gate To estimate the transition probability between states , we first label each frame according to our definition of the open , occluded , open and wide - open states . Then , we went through four unbiased trajectories and counted the number of transitions between states . Then the number of transitions is recorded as element of transition matrix T . To obtain probabilities , we normalize the matrix by dividing each element in the transition matrix by the total count of transitions from the corresponding state . This step ensures that the matrix represents a valid probability distribution . State Predict Information Bottleneck SPIB utilizes a neural network with an encoder and decoder structure to effectively cluster the high - dimensional MD trajectories into metastable states . The neural network is trained to extract only the essential information from past trajectories , which is crucial for accurately predicting the future state of the system . During the training process , the network learns a discrete - state representation , focusing specifically on the motion associated with state - to - state transitions . For our specific implementation , we selected a deep neural network as the encoder to effectively capture the nonlinear relationship among the input variables . The training dataset comprised 24 pairwise distances between atoms involved in forming the H - bond network around R177 . Default hyperparameters were employed , and a time delay of 3 ns was chosen to filter out fast dynamic . Initial Structure Preparation for constrained simulations We used Steered - MD ( SMD ) to create the initial structures for constrained simulations , with all subunit dihedral angles being driven to - 3° . We first applied harmonic restraints with a force constant of 5000 kJ / mol / radian 2 on the dihedral angles of all subunits . The center of harmonic restraints moves to - 3 . 01 radians in 10 ns with a constant velocity . Then we fixed the centers of harmonic restraints and linearly decreased or increased the force constant between 5000 kJ / mol / radian 2 and 100 kJ / mol / radian 2 with a 20 ns period . This relaxation process helped the system better find the local minimum . Fig . S6 shows how the center and the force constant change during the simulation of preparing the initial structure . After the SMD simulations , the restraint on the central subunit was removed , and a 100 ns simulation was initialized to further equilibrate the system . The initial structure was picked from the frame with the central unit dihedral angle being closest to - 3° during the last equilibrium phase . Supplemental Table Table S1 .

In the first 10 ns , the center of harmonic potential gradually approached the target dihedral angle ( - 3° ) with a constant velocity and the force constant was kept at a constant of 5000 kJ / mol / radian 2 . Subsequently , the center of the harmonic potential was fixed , and its force constant oscillated linearly between 5000 kJ / mol / radian 2 and 100 kJ / mol / radian 2 a period of 20 ns . Fig . S7 .
