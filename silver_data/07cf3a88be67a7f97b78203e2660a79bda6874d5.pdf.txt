The function of this coat is to sort proteins in the membrane and to contribute to membrane deformation . This can result in transport of sequestered cargo in a clathrin - coated vesicle or segregation of proteins in a clathrin - coated membrane patch . Clathrin sorts proteins at the plasma membrane , at endosomal membranes , and in the trans - Golgi network for organelle biogenesis as well as in numerous special - ized pathways with physiological relevance ( Figure 1 ) . The latter include secretory granule formation , antigen presentation , virus maturation , glucose transporter sequestration , and synaptic vesicle generation . Clathrin was the ﬁrst such membrane coat described , and its characterization deﬁned the prototype for membrane coat function that applies to other intracellular coats such as COPI , COPII , retromer complexes , and ESCRTs . All of these self - assembling coats are recruited to mem - branes , often through intermediary proteins ( adaptors , in the case of clathrin ) that interact with membrane components . Self - assembly of the coat organizes the adaptor components , which in turn concentrate the membrane com - ponents and exclude components that cannot associate with the coat ( Figure 2 ) . Similar to clathrin , COP complexes form coated vesicles , whereas retromer assembly creates membrane domains and tubules , and ESCRT assem - bly sequentially generates sorting domains and causes vesicle invagination , all of which contribute to membrane protein sorting . This reductionist view of intracellular coat formation has deﬁned general principles of membrane trafﬁc as well as principles required for membrane bending and budding . Notably , however , each of these coats operates in very distinct intracellular pathways , and their unique properties confer a remarkable diver - sity of function . Moreover , the conventional concept of clathrin as a vesicle coat protein is apparently only one limited view of its 17 . 2 Brodsky Changes may still occur before final publication online and in print A nnu .

Retrograde transport pathways 1 , 2 , and 3 are described in the text . intracellular functions . Novel intracellular functions have been revealed through new in - formation about the biochemistry and diversity of the clathrin heavy and light chain subunits , as well as through analysis of the cellular effects of both clathrin depletion from mammalian cells and genetic deletion from yeast , Dictyostelium , and worms . These include novel functions in bacterial infection and cytokinesis , which arise from clathrin interaction with actin and microtubules , as well as a novel function in human glucose metabolism acquired through genetic diversity of the human clathrin heavy chain subunit , which produces a second iso - form of clathrin . The focus of this review is to revisit and update clathrin biochemistry and genetics and to consider the diverse cellular functions of clathrin in this context . How diversiﬁcation of clathrin function is relevant to pathways of human health and disease is also addressed . BIOCHEMICAL AND GENETIC DIVERSITY OF CLATHRIN PROTEINS The clathrin protein is composed of three trimerized heavy chain subunits that can self - assemble into a polyhedral array on membranes ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . The most well - characterized form of clathrin has bound light chain subunits . Clathrin heavy chains ( CHCs ) are present in all eukaryotes analyzed ( Wakeham et al . 2005 ) . The clathrin light chain ( CLC ) subunit is more difﬁcult to identify in distant eukaryotic species . With the emergence of vertebrates , separate gene duplications gave rise to two CHCs and two CLCs ( see Table 1 for human gene names www . annualreviews . org • Diversity of Clathrin Function 17 . 3 Changes may still occur before final publication online and in print A nnu .

(cid:6) Clathrin - coated pits morph into coated vesicles , and scission from the membrane is mediated by dynamin and actin .

(cid:7) Clathrin triskelia are uncoated by concerted action of Hsc70 and the auxillin / GAK proteins in an ATP - dependent reaction .

The two CHCs , now named for their encoding human chromosomes ( 17 and 22 ) , form the basis of two distinct clathrins , both of which contribute to protein sorting into coated membrane vesicles or domains at different intracellular locations ( Figure 1 ) . The well - characterized isoform CHC17 clathrin is involved in many intracellular membrane trafﬁc pathways including receptor - mediated endo - cytosis , lysosome biogenesis , and endosomal sorting . CHC17 is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues . CHC22 clathrin , in contrast , mediates a very deﬁned step in retrograde transport from endosomes to the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) . In muscle , in which its expression is highest , CHC22 controls transport pathways that inﬂuence targeting of the GLUT4 glucose transporter , and it plays the same role in fat ( Vassilopoulos et al . 2009 ) . The low level of CHC22 in other tissues also contributes to 17 . 4 Brodsky Changes may still occur before final publication online and in print A nnu . R e v . C e ll D e v . B i o l . 2012 . 28 .

CB28CH17 - Brodsky ARI 13 July 2012 19 : 19 intracellular retrograde transport ( Esk et al . 2010 ) . The two vertebrate genes encoding CLCs produce CLCa and CLCb ( formerly called LCa and LCb in the literature ) , both of which are characterized by neuronal splicing variants . In cells , CLCa and CLCb associate exclusively with CHC17 and are involved in its function and stability , and they do not bind CHC22 clathrin ( Liu et al . 2001 ) . Biochemistry and Structure of the CHC17 Clathrin Heavy Chain Structural and biochemical analysis of clathrin has focused on the CHC17 isoform . The CHC22 isoform , which is 85 % identical in protein sequence to CHC17 , has distinct biochemical properties ( described below ) . The sequences of nonvertebrate clathrins are suf - ﬁciently divergent from CHC17 that they are equally CHC22 - like in sequence ( Wakeham et al . 2005 ) . However , the functional clathrin studied in yeast , worms , Dictyostelium , and Drosophila consists of CHCs with bound CLC subunits , which makes them more similar to CHC17 . CHC comprises two structural elements that have been suggested as shared features of membrane - associated proteins in eukaryotic cells : a long α - solenoid region and a single β - propeller domain . Other coat proteins and some nuclear pore complex proteins comprise different combinations of these two structural domains ( Field et al . 2011 ) . The CHC17 α - solenoid region consists of eight repeats of a structural motif of 10 helices of 10 – 12 residues connected by loops ( Figure 3 ) ( Ybe et al . 1999 ) . The motif is designated as a clathrin heavy chain repeat ( CHCR ) and a recent alignment of CHCRs in bovine clathrin heavy chain is available in the online supple - ment to Wilbur et al . ( 2010b ) . The CHCRs form the ankle , distal leg , and proximal leg segments , and the C - terminal end of CHCR7 contributes to trimerization ( Ybe et al . 2007b ) . The trimerization domain also comprises a helical tripod that extends from CHCR7 below the triskelion vertex toward the cell membrane ( Fotin et al . 2004b ) . The vertex itself is puckered ( Figure 3 ) , which gives the CHC17 Terminal domain ( TD ) residues 1 – 330 115 Å Linker + ankle residues 331 – 838 Distal leg residues 839 – 1073 Kneeresidues 1074 – 1197 1675 1 331 543 CHC17 CHC22 692 839 985 1134 1280 1429 839 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1074 1198 15761640 Terminaldomain Linker Ankle Distal leg Knee Proximal leg TxD 483 331 1576 Proximal leg residues 1198 – 1575 Trimerization domain ( TxD ) residues 1576 – 1675 Hub residues 1074 – 1675 4 90° 1 2 3 Figure 3 Structural features of clathrin heavy chains .

The four numbered sites on the terminal domain structure represent binding sites for interacting proteins based on Lemmon & Traub ( 2012 ) . At the bottom , the predicted domain structure of CHC22 is aligned with CHC17 , and the amino acid boundaries of the eight clathrin heavy chain repeats ( CHCR 0 – 7 ) in CHC17 are delineated .

Interestingly , Vps41 is re - ported to be a self - assembling protein in yeast that interacts with the AP3 adaptor molecule ( Darsow et al . 2001 ) .

The terminal domain ( TD ) of CHC17 is a seven - bladed β - propeller , connected to CHCR0 of the ankle , by a linker region ( Figure 3 ) . Recently , Lemmon & Traub ( 2012 ) comprehensively reviewed the interactions between the TD and clathrin - binding proteins , including descrip - tions of structural details and binding motifs . The main partners for the TD are adaptors and accessory proteins , which interact with four dif - ferent sites on the TD . One of the TD - binding motifs is known as a clathrin box ( generalized as L (cid:2) X (cid:2) [ DE ] ) . Two small molecule inhibitors of TD - accessory protein interaction , Pitstops 1 and 2 , interfere with clathrin box binding and were shown in cocrystals to bind between TD blades ( von Kleist et al . 2011 ) ( see section on Tools to Study Clathrin ) . An additional binding site for adaptors is localized between CHCR1 and CHCR2 ( Knuehl et al . 2006 ) in the ankle domain . Formation of clathrin lat - tices from recombinantly expressed fragments suggests that the combination of TD binding and ankle binding by adaptors contributes to lattice assembly through multimerization ( Greene et al . 2000 ) . Clathrin Light Chains and Their Inﬂuence on Binding Partners The CLCs are unstructured until bound to CHCs . Their binding interface was deﬁned by mutagenesis and molecular dynamic mod - eling ( Chen et al . 2002 ) and conﬁrmed by cryoelectron microscopy localization ( Fotin et al . 2004b ) . Three key tryptophan residues in mammalian CLCs mediate CHC interaction , and mutation of these contact residues in ei - ther subunit disrupts their interaction . The CLCs bind along the proximal leg segment up through CHCR7 ( Figure 3 ) with variable knee interaction ( Figure 4 ) ( Wilbur et al . 2010b ) . The CLC C termini stabilize trimerization ( Ybe et al . 2007b ) The CLCs attenuate self - assembly of triske - lia in vitro at physiological pH , and this likely contributes to their function in vivo . CLC has two different conformations when bound to CHC , one that extends from the trimerization domain to the bend in the knee , and the other retracted from the knee ( Figure 4 ) ( Wilbur et al . 2010b ) . The extended CLC is associated with a “straighter” knee that is not compatible with lattice assembly , which suggests that CLC retraction from the knee regulates its bending and ﬁne - tunes assembly ( Figure 4 ) . Consis - tent with this mechanism , CLC undergoes a conformational change during pH - induced as - sembly and a pH - sensitive salt bridge , which mediates CLC - knee interaction , was identiﬁed by mutagenesis ( Wilbur et al . 2010b ) . Adap - tor binding overcomes assembly inhibition by CLC at physiological pH , by contributing to CHC rearrangement , possibly changing the local environment to induce CLCs to change conformation . CLCs are stable subunits of the CHC17 triskelion , and there is no evidence that they actively detach from CHC17 in the cell , though they may be removed by proteolysis . CHC17 triskelia puriﬁed from brain have one CLC bound per CHC . Proteomics suggests that CHCs may not be saturated by CLCs in every tissue ( Girard et al . 2005 ) , but these data have not yet been veriﬁed by other methods . 17 . 6 Brodsky Changes may still occur before final publication online and in print A nnu .

CB28CH17 - Brodsky ARI 13 July 2012 19 : 19 Depletion of CLCs by siRNA from mam - malian cells does not have a measurable effect on the receptor - mediated endocytosis of trans - ferrin and epidermal growth factor ( Huang et al . 2004 , Poupon et al . 2008 ) . However , CLCs are required for uptake of some G - protein - coupledreceptors ( Ferreiraetal . 2012 ) . As negative regulators of clathrin assembly , CLC may be dispensable for uptake of mem - brane that remains ﬂexible with certain cargo , but CLC contribution to triskelion rigidity may be required for uptake of less forgiving cargo .

( a ) Domain structures and alignment of CLCa and CLCb . EED are the three negatively charged amino acids that regulate clathrin assembly within the 22 - residue consensus ( CON ) sequence shared by CLCa ( residues 28 – 49 ) and CLCb ( residues 20 – 41 ) . This sequence includes the binding site for Hip proteins . Other features shared by the two CLCs include an EF - hand that binds calcium ( Ca 2 + ) , the heavy - chain - binding region ( HC ) , neuronally expressed inserts ( N ) , and a calmodulin - binding domain ( CBD ) . CLCa has a unique region ( Hsc70 ) that stimulates Hsc70 activity in vitro , and CLCb has a unique serine phosphorylation site ( P ) .

CB28CH17 - Brodsky ARI 13 July 2012 19 : 19 Both vertebrate CLCs have neuronal splic - ing variants that acquire short hydrophobic se - quences at their C termini ( 18 or 30 residues in CLCa and 18 residues in CLCb ) , which also introduce new cysteines ( Jackson et al . 1987 ) . The neuronal inserts are located in a region that potentially could inﬂuence conformation at the triskelion vertex . The inserted sequences account for the extra molecular mass charac - teristic of brain CLCs , and for their propensity toformintramoleculardisulﬁdebonds ( Parham etal . 1989 ) , whichmakesitdifﬁculttoassignthe identity of CLCa or CLCb isoforms by molec - ular mass alone . To date , no signiﬁcant physiological differ - ences have been documented for CLCa and CLCb , though they have only 60 % identity and “a - ness and b - ness” are highly conserved in vertebrates . CLCa and CLCb have very dif - ferent ratios of expression in different tissues , withLCadominantinlymphoidtissueandLCb dominant in brain . Their distinct biochemical properties include a unique target site for serine phosphorylation near the CLCb N terminus , and a region in CLCa that stimulates Hsc70 activity in vitro , which indicates a potential for differential function ( Figure 4 ) ( Brodsky et al . 1991 ) . Both CLCs bind calcium and confer cal - cium sensitivity on in vitro clathrin assembly . Thelongeststretchofsharedsequencebetween CLCa and CLCb is 22 residues near their N termini , which starts with negatively charged residues responsible for CLC binding to the CHC knee .

The C - terminal region of Hip1R also binds cor - tactin ( Le Clainche et al . 2007 ) . Mammalian Hip1R is an extended homodimer , and does not heterodimerize with Hip1 , which is also an obligate homodimer ( Wilbur et al . 2008 ) . Lack of heterodimerization is consistent with distinct phenotypes resulting from deletion of either Hip1 - or Hip1R - encoding genes ( Bradley et al . 2007 ) . Structures of the coiled - coil and THATCH regions of Hip1 are known ( Brett et al . 2006 , Wilbur et al . 2010b , Ybe et al . 2007a ) . The coiled - coil region has char - acteristic , less - ordered areas that are targets for binding proteins , which include CLCs , HIPPI ( Hip protein interactor ) , androgen receptor , huntingtin protein and , Pan1p ( AP180 - CALM homolog ) for Sla2p ( Boettner et al . 2012 ) . CLC binding to the coiled - coil domains of Hip1 or Hip1R induces a conformation change in the Hip proteins ( Figure 5 ) , such that their afﬁnity for actin is reduced considerably ( Figure 5 ) ( Wilbur et al . 2008 ) . This activity is reproduced fully by the CLC consensus peptide , and the N terminus of yeast CLC also negatively regulates interaction between Sla2p and actin ( Boettner et al . 2011 ) . If Hip proteins are depleted , actin is not targeted properly to clathrin lattices . However , actin binding and CLC binding to Hip proteins seem to be mutually exclusive . A proposed sequence of events , consistent with existing data , is that Hip proteins are recruited to clathrin - coated membranes via CLC then dissociate from CLC and bind membranes through CLC - independent interactions in the vicinity of the clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) neck , where they can then inﬂuence actin dynamics . In the case of a forming CCV , this would exclude Hip - actin interactions from the lattice itself but focus them where they contribute to scission , as seen in electron micrographs ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . 2001 ) ( Figure 5 ) . The CHC22 Clathrin Isoform , a Second Form of Human Clathrin The CHC22 protein is expressed and func - tional in human cells and tissues , and its pat - tern of evolution reveals conservation of char - acteristic signature residues that are different from those found at the same positions in CHC17 , which indicates a conserved function ( Figure 3 ) . However , the gene encoding CHC22 clathrin is a pseudogene in mice , lost in both laboratory and wild mouse strains ( Wakeham et al . 2005 ) . In humans , CHC22 performs the critical , tissue - speciﬁc role of targeting of the GLUT4 transporter to the insulin - responsive GLUT4 storage compart - ment ( GSC ) that regulates GLUT4 expres - sion during postprandial glucose metabolism . GLUT4 targeting is mediated by CHC17 in murine cells , so CHC22 clathrin ﬁlls a spe - cial , species - restricted niche in humans . Bio - chemical characterization of CHC22 clathrin is still in a nascent stage ( Liu et al . 2001 , Vas - silopoulos et al . 2009 ) . The hub fragment of the molecule behaves as a trimer , and recent micro - graphs show that CHC22 forms a triskelion ( K . Sakamoto , S . Vassilopoulos , R . Roth , J . Heuser , and F . M . Brodsky , unpublished research ) . CHC22 binds the AP1 , AP3 , and GGA2 forms of adaptors , all of which are associated with en - dosomal sorting pathways . Under normal cir - cumstances of cellular expression , CHC22 does not bind the plasma membrane adaptor AP2 or CLCs , and it is not detected on the mitotic spindle ( Esk et al . 2010 ) . Nor does it interact with CHC17 in cells . Even in cell types where itismostabundant ( muscleandHeLa ) , CHC22 is expressed at eight - to tenfold lower levels than CHC17 .

And , in yeast two - hybrid as - says , CHC22 binding to CLC can be detected , though their interaction is not observed in cells . CHC22 cellular function has been analyzed in HeLa and in human muscle and fat cells us - ing siRNA depletion . These studies , expanded upon in the next section , deﬁne a role in late endosomal sorting and formation of the GSC . Depletion of CHC17 causes loss of CHC22 by proteomic analysis , so it has been suggested that the two might interact ( Borner et al . 2006 ) , butthereisstrongbiochemical evidenceagainst their interaction ( Liu et al . 2001 ) . A likely ex - planation of the proteomics is that CHC22 is localized to an intracellular endosomal com - partment that depends on CHC17 function for its formation . Loss of membranes for CHC22 to bind would reduce its intracellular stabil - ity . Yeast two - hybrid analysis identiﬁed sorting nexin 5 ( SNX5 ) as a binding partner for the hub domain of CHC22 in the equivalent re - gion that binds CLC on CHC17 ( Towler et al . 2004 ) . Lack of CLC association with CHC22 in cells suggests that CHC22 assembly is regu - lated differently from CHC17 . CHC22 is encoded within a multigenic re - gion that is deleted in individuals with Di - George syndrome and velocardiofacial syn - drome , who are obligate heterozygotes for one wild - type chromosome 22 ( Meechan et al . 2007 ) . The equivalent region is inverted in the mouse genome ( Botta et al . 1997 ) , and the displaced gene for CHC22 has degenerated into a pseudogene . In humans , genetic varia - tion of CHC22 is more extensive than that of CHC17 ( P . NormanandF . M . Brodsky , unpub - lished observation ) . Thus the genetic signature of CHC22 is typical of a gene that is still under - going selection , consistent with its recent ap - pearance during vertebrate evolution . Biochemistry of Clathrin Assembly , Disassembly , and Nanomaterial Potential Assembly of puriﬁed CHC17 clathrin ( with bound CLCs ) into a polyhedral basket is triggered in vitro by low pH or addition of calcium , both nonphysiological conditions , or by interaction with adaptors . In the early 1980s , the Edelhoch group published several studies characterizing the effects of salts , ionic strength , and chaotropic agents on clathrin self - assembly in vitro ( e . g . , Nandi & Edelhoch 1984 ) . This somewhat - forgotten body of literature is a treasure trove of information for those interested in the nanomaterial potential of clathrin , as well its basic biochemical behavior . Recently , in silico models of clathrin assembly have been developed that recapit - ulate assembly behavior and eventually will be applicable to predicting key interactions that regulate assembly ( see http : / / www . cell . com / biophysj / supplemental / S0006 - 3495 % 2810 % 2900721 - 6 for a movie of this simula - tion ; den Otter et al . 2010 ) . These simulations make reasonable assumptions about the ener - getics of interactions between triskelion legs , though all we know presently is that binding constants are weak ( in the micromolar range ) ( Wakeham et al . 2003 ) . In silico models predict that changing the triskelion pucker angle at the vertex would destabilize a ﬂat lattice and make it energetically favorable to repair the lattice with a curved conformation ( den Otter & Briels , 2011 ) . In a cell , pucker could conceivably be altered by CLC changes at the trimerization domain and / or knees , or by cargo interaction with adaptors beneath the clathrin TDs . In a lattice , the knees and TDs are situated below each vertex ( Fotin et al . 2004b ) . Whether the transition from a ﬂat lattice to a curved lattice to a fully coated bud occurs by internal rearrangement from hexagons to pentagons or by addition of triskelia at the edge is not resolved . However , it is clear from recent elegant in vitro reconstitution experiments that the energetics of clathrin assembly alone are sufﬁciently favorable to cause formation of coated vesicles from large liposomes ( Dannhauser & Ungewickell 2012 ) . In the cell , clathrin assembly also recruits lipid - modifying proteins to assist vesiculation , and CCVs require dynamin for scission from the plasma membrane . 17 . 10 Brodsky Changes may still occur before final publication online and in print A nnu .

This reaction is carried out by Hsc70 , also called the uncoating ATPase , and is facilitated by the DNAJ - domain - containing proteins auxilin and GAK ( Yim et al . 2010 ) . Cryoelectron microscopy studies of puriﬁed auxilinbindingtobasketsofpuriﬁedclathrinlo - calize auxilin binding to the region underneath the vertex , and biochemical studies suggest in - teraction between Hsc70 and a peptide in CHC that is C - terminal to the trimerization domain ( Fotin et al . 2004a , Rapoport et al . 2008 ) . ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 bound in this region po - tentially could alter triskelion pucker and put strain on the lattice to cause the destabilization suggested by in silico models . The issue of how many ATPs must be hydrolyzed to induce dis - assembly and the precise sequence of molecu - larinteractionsduringuncoatingisnotresolved ( Bockingetal . 2011 , Rothnieetal . 2011 ) . Three studies have also suggested a role for CLC in uncoating through independent inﬂuence on hsc70 and auxillin activity ( DeLuca - Flaherty et al . 1990 , Ferreira et al . 2012 , Schmid et al . 1984 ) , though uncoating CHC17 can occur without CLC ( Ungewickell et al . 1995 ) . CLC could potentially inﬂuence uncoating through their inﬂuence on knee conformation beneath a lattice vertex . The molecular regulation of CHC22 uncoating has not yet been deﬁned . Because of its remarkable self - assembly properties , there is interest in exploiting clathrin as a nanomaterial ( Schoen et al . 2011 ) . It has been proposed that clathrin could serve as a platform for organizing chemical reactions between linked moieties to promote enzymatic reactions or form nanobatteries . In this context , understanding the principles of self - interaction that drive clathrin assembly will have value for designing synthetic self - assembling systems that resemble clathrin morphology . CLATHRIN - MEDIATED MEMBRANE TRAFFIC PATHWAYS IN CELLS Clathrin ( CHC17 ) forms several types of structures on the cytoplasmic face of cellular membranes . At the plasma membrane , these include classic coated pits and budded coated vesicles with diameters of 80 – 200nm as well ﬂat lattices ( sometimes called “plaques” ) . The latter are observed on the basal surface of an attached cell ( Saffarian et al . 2009 ) at sites of integrin - substrate interaction ( De Deyne et al . 1998 ) , and can be induced by immobilization of ligands for receptors that are normally internalized in CCVs ( Takemura et al . 1986 ) . In the TGN , clathrin coats are observed at the ends of emanating tubules and also on CCVs ( Klumperman 2011 ) , which suggests that CCVs pinch off from tubules as well as from larger compartments ( Mogelsvang et al . 2004 ) . On early endosomes , clathrin forms coated regions adjacent to retromer - coated regions , and both appear to be sorting patches for targeting cargo into retromer - generated tubules ( Johannes & Popoff 2008 ) . On late endosomal membranes , clathrin also forms a sorting patch with a bilayered appearance that initiates ESCRT component recruitment and assembly ( Raiborg et al . 2002 ) . The adaptors that recruit clathrin to membranes determine the location of clathrin assembly and the type of cargo that is accumulated in the clathrin - coated structures formed ( Figure 2 ) . In this section , the regulation and cellular functions of these sorting stations are discussed . Adaptor Proteins , Assembly Nucleation , Scission , and Uncoating Adaptors for clathrin recruitment provide speciﬁcity to the clathrin coat . Their struc - tures , functions , and cargo speciﬁcities have been characterized extensively , and both are described in detail in contemporaneous review articles ( Kelly & Owen 2011 , McMahon & Boucrot 2011 , Reider & Wendland 2011 ) . Here , the general features are summarized . The “classical” adaptors , AP1 and AP2 , are heterotetramers comprising two subunits of ∼ 100 kDa ( γ & β 1 or α & β 2 ) , one subunit of ∼ 50 kDa ( μ 1 or μ 2 ) , and one subunit of ∼ 20 kDa ( σ 1 or σ 2 ) . The 100 - kDa subunits are divided into core and appendage domains www . annualreviews . org • Diversity of Clathrin Function 17 . 11 Changes may still occur before final publication online and in print A nnu .

The α - , β - , and γ - appendage domains also bind clathrin ( Edeling et al . 2006 , Knuel et al . 2006 ) . The core domains of the 100 - kDa subunits bind the μ and σ subunits , which together bind cargo and phosphoinositides . The monomeric proteins known as GGA ( for Golgi - localized , γ - ear - containing , ARF - binding proteins ) also serve as clathrin adaptors ( Robinson & Bonifacino2001 ) . Theseproteinsare ∼ 100kDa and have a C - terminal domain with homology to the γ - appendage ( GAE ) , a central domain ( GAT ) that binds ARF1 , and an N - terminal domain ( VHS ) that binds cargo with a DXXLL motif . The combined VHS and GAT domains also recognize ubiquitin on cargo and interact with ubiquitin - sorting machinery . The hinge segment between the GAE and GAT domains binds clathrin via clathrin box sequences . The appendage domains of GGAs and APs bind multiple accessory proteins that enhance the lipid - binding and cargo - binding speciﬁcities of these adaptors . They also recruit BAR domain – containing proteins that contribute to membrane deformation , as well as lipid kinases and phosphatases . These diverse accessory proteins can compete with each other and with clathrin for appendage binding during coat formation ( Edeling et al . 2006 ) . A growing family of clathrin - associated sorting proteins ( CLASPs ) has been identiﬁed ( see table in Reider & Wendland 2011 ) , several members of which comprise all four functions of AP1 , AP2 , and GGAs ( clathrin binding , cargo binding , lipid binding , and accessory protein binding ) . Other CLASPs and indeed other heterote - trameric adaptor - like complexes ( AP3 , AP4 , andAP5 ) lackoneormoreofthefourfunctions . AP3canbindclathrin , butthisinteractionisnot detected consistently in mammalian cells , and in yeast , Ap3 binds Vps41 , a different CHCR - containing protein ( Darsow et al . 2001 ) . AP4 and AP5 adaptors do not bind clathrin , but one AP5 - interacting protein , SPG11 , has predicted homology to clathrin ( Hirst et al . 2011 ) . Many studies have addressed the dynamics of clathrin - coated pit nucleation and budding using time - lapse total internal reﬂection ﬂuo - rescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . The very ﬁrst of these studies indicated that there are favorable sites for clathrin recruitment and CCV budding ( Gaidarov et al . 1999 ) . Subsequent studies indi - cated that some sites of clathrin recruitment are productive for CCV budding and others are not ( Kirchhausen 2009 , Mettlen et al . 2009 ) . For - mation of endocytic coated vesicles relies on the membrane recruitment of AP2 and its interac - tion with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which induces a con - formational change in AP2 to promote cargo binding ( Antonescu et al . 2011 , Cocucci et al . 2012 , Kelly & Owen 2011 ) . Single - molecule imaging suggests this interaction has to be ac - companied by clathrin recruitment , such that successful coat formation is a cooperative pro - cess ( Cocucci et al . 2012 ) . There is evidence that some of the CLASPs ( e . g . , DAB2 ) that share all AP functions can sustain coated pit formation without AP2 ( Mulkearns & Cooper 2012 ) . Others require interaction with AP2 ( e . g . , β - arrestin ) ( Laporte et al . 2000 ) . The CLASPs FCHo1 and FCHo2 contain BAR do - mainsthatrecognizelipidswithashallowcurve . Though proposed as universal coated pit nucle - ators , there remains some debate as to how the FCHO proteins contribute to coated pit initi - ation ( Cocucci et al . 2012 , Henne et al . 2010 , Nunez et al . 2011 , Umasankar et al . 2012 ) . Nucleation of clathrin assembly by AP1 adaptors at the TGN requires membrane - associated GTP - bound ARF1 . Studies in yeast indicate that this process also involves sequen - tial recruitment of PtdIns ( 4 ) - kinase and GGA2 prior to AP1 binding ( Daboussi et al . 2012 ) . This sequence could generate CCVs budding at the same site that incorporate different cargo or direct shared cargo into CCVs of different types . The evidence that cargo plays an impor - tant role in early stages of clathrin coat forma - tion at both the plasma membrane and TGN is strong ( Hirst et al . 2007 , Liu et al . 2010 ) . Thus , a successful clathrin coat forms by cooperation between adaptors and clathrin at the outset , en - hanced by cargo . 17 . 12 Brodsky Changes may still occur before final publication online and in print A nnu .

CB28CH17 - Brodsky ARI 13 July 2012 19 : 19 Since nucleation of clathrin assembly at the membrane involves adaptor interaction with phosphoinositides , clathrin uncoating is triggered by lipid phosphatases or lipid turnover , in addition to the action of hsc70 and DNAJ - domain containing proteins . No - tably , endophilin plays a role in uncoating by recruiting the phosphatase synaptojanin to the plasma membrane to hydrolyze PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which is bound by the AP2 adaptor ( Milosevic et al . 2011 ) . Levels of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 are also inﬂuenced by RME - 6 acting as a GEF to stim - ulate Rab5 - mediated turnover of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 during uncoating of endocytic CCVs ( Se - merdjieva et al . 2008 ) . At endosomes , the DNAJ - domain - containing protein RME - 8 , which interacts with ESCRTs , also plays a role in CHC17 clathrin uncoating ( Shi et al . 2009 ) . It became evident from the Shibire mu - tation in Drosophila that dynamin activity is required for the scission of CCVs from the synaptic plasma membrane ( Koenig & Ikeda , 1989 ) . Dynamin structure and its biochemical and chemical properties were reviewed recently by Schmid & Frolov ( 2011 ) , and the physio - logical and cellular functions were reviewed by Ferguson & De Camilli ( 2012 ) . Dynamins are self - assembling GTPases of ∼ 100 kDa that in - teract with membranes and form ringed struc - tures . They are members of a larger family of dynamin - like proteins that participate in mem - brane ﬁssion at multiple intracellular sites . Dy - namin ( three forms in mammals and one in worms and Drosophila ) assembles at the neck of a budded endocytic CCV in neuronal and non - neuronal cells . Subsequent hydrolysis of GTP induces a conformational change that promotes vesicle scission . Genetic deletion ex - periments in mice have conﬁrmed a role for dy - namin in CCV scission at neuronal synapses , and mutiple TIRF studies reveal a burst of dynamin recruitment to budding CCVs just prior to scission ( e . g . , Taylor et al . 2011 ) . The role of dynamin in the scission of CCVs in yeast or forming at mammalian intracellular membranes is less clear . It appears that dy - namins can participate in CCV budding from the TGN but may not be essential for this pathway . Receptor - Mediated Endocytosis , Phosphorylation , and Signaling The role of CCVs in receptor - mediated endocytosis was postulated with the discovery of these structures in Roth & Porter’s ( 1964 ) classic morphological studies of yolk uptake in mosquito oocytes . The accumulation of evidence for this function over the ensuing 48 years is overwhelming . CCVs mediate both ligand - dependent and constitutive uptake of receptors . The former are generally receptors that signal in response to ligand binding and the latter include receptors for nutrients such as transferrin . During constitutive endocytosis , the clathrin - binding hinge regions of the α , β 2 , and β 1 subunits of AP2 and AP1 are phosphorylated on serine residues when these adaptors are cytosolic . Dephosphorylation allows clathrin binding and occurs prior to CCV formation ( Wilde & Brodsky 1996 ) . The regulatory kinase is not established , but phos - phatase 2A is associated with CCVs and can dephosphorylate these subunits ( Ricotta et al . 2008 ) . Two CCV - associated serine / threonine kinases are implicated in regulation of cargo binding . AAK1 phosphorylation of threonine 156 in the μ 2 subunit enhances AP2 binding to cargo , and its activity is stimulated by clathrin assembly ( Ricotta et al . 2008 ) . The clathrin - binding kinase CVAK104 is present in the endocytic pathway and the TGN and inﬂuences SNARE protein trafﬁc ( Borner et al . 2007 , D¨uwel & Ungewickell 2006 ) . Dephos - phorylation of the μ 2 subunit of AP2 , which reduces its cargo afﬁnity , contributes to CCV uncoating and is stimulated by displacement of AAK1 from AP2 through competition by the Rab5 GEF RME - 6 ( Semerdjieva et al . 2008 ) . In ligand - gated , receptor - mediated en - docytosis , several phosphorylation pathways regulate uptake upon ligand - induced signal - ing . CHC17 is phosphorylated at tyrosines 1477 and 1487 by SRC - family kinase activity downstream of ligand engagement of receptor www . annualreviews . org • Diversity of Clathrin Function 17 . 13 Changes may still occur before final publication online and in print A nnu .

CB28CH17 - Brodsky ARI 13 July 2012 19 : 19 tyrosine kinases ( e . g . , EGF - receptor and NGF - receptor ) ( Beattie et al . 2000 , Bonazzi et al . 2011 , Wilde et al . 1999 ) or T cell recep - tors and B cell receptors ( Crotzer et al . 2004 , Stoddart et al . 2002 ) . Studies with inhibitors suggested that CHC17 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are required for uptake of T cell receptors ( Crotzer et al . 2004 ) . This observation , and the fact that clathrin appears to be increased at the plasma membrane under conditions that promote phosphorylation , led to the hypothesis that CHC17 phosphorylation might temporarily inhibit budding of CCVs and stabilize clathrin - coated pits . Notably , coated pits are observed at the edges of Fc - receptor signaling domains , where SRC - family kinases are activated ( Wilson et al . 2000 ) , and at bacterial - host cell contacts where SRC - family kinases also phosphorylate clathrin ( Bonazzi et al . 2011 ) . In the case of bacterial interaction , these stable coated pits are exploited by the organism to organize actin , which mediates infectious uptake or adhesion ( see next section ) . In the case of signaling receptors , CHC17 phosphorylation followed by dephospho - rylation could synchronize endocytosis and attenuate or enhance signaling by clearance into endosomes . Receptor phosphorylation induced by ligand binding can regulate adaptor interactions by altering cytoplasmic tail recog - nition , as for EGF receptor ( Chen et al . 1989 ) . For G - protein - coupled receptors ( Laporte et al . 2000 ) , ligand - induced phosphorylation of associated β - arrestin recruits the AP2 adap - tor . Thus ligand - induced receptor signaling inﬂuences receptor internalization by several pathways , which in turn attenuate or alter re - ceptor signaling ( Sorkin & von Zastrow 2009 ) . Endosomal Sorting and Retrograde Transport Clathrin participates in pathways of endosomal sorting and rapid recycling after cargo accesses early endosomes . The involvement of clathrin in recycling to the plasma membrane has been a matter of debate , as techniques for interfer - ence with clathrin function are blunt tools for probing what is likely a delicately balanced pathway . The recent characterization of a dy - namic pool of G - clathrin associated with recy - cling transferrin receptors suggests that there is at least some clathrin - mediated , rapid recep - tor recycling ( recycling pathway in Figure 1 ) ( Zhao & Keen 2008 ) . G - clathrin is so called be - causeitisdetectedasgyratingsignalsofclathrin ( labeled by CLCa - GFP ) , possibly on tubules , in the vicinity of endosomes . G - clathrin colocal - izes with GGA1 and is distinct from pathways destined for late endosomes and lysosomes . AP1 - associated clathrin at other tubules ema - nating from early endosomes is implicated in retrograde transport of TGN38 / TGN46 pro - teins to the TGN ( retrograde 1 pathway in Figure 1 ) ( Bonifacino & Rojas 2006 ) . Forcargo tobesortedintotubulesafterentryintoanearly endosome , it is associated with clathrin - coated patches that are localized adjacent to patches of retromer components that induce tubule for - mation ( Johannes & Popoff 2008 ) . Clathrin is involved in sorting cargo from late endosomes to the TGN via retrograde pathways 2 and 3 in Figure 1 ( Shields & Piper 2011 ) . In human cells , the CHC22 isoform of clathrin functions in this sorting station ( Figure 1 ) , possibly in both pathways , through interaction with the AP1 and GGA2 adaptors . In mice , which are lacking CHC22 , this sorting step is mediated by CHC17 , but in human cells , CHC22 competes with CHC17 for binding to late endosomal membranes and contributes to retrograde sorting of mannose - 6 - phosphate re - ceptorandShigatoxin ( Esketal . 2010 ) . Because CHC22 is present in tenfold - lower amounts than CHC17 , these observations indicate preferential speciﬁcity for CHC22 function in this step . CHC22 interaction with SNX5 ( Towler et al . 2004 ) may contribute to CHC22 membrane localization and its ability to com - pete locally with CHC17 . Thus , CHC22 could operate adjacent to retromer sorting patches , as observed for CHC17 on early endosomes . Multivesicular bodies form by ESCRT - induced invagination of late endosomal membrane during degradation of ubiquiti - nated proteins ( Henne et al . 2011 , Hurley & 17 . 14 Brodsky Changes may still occur before final publication online and in print A nnu .

F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y . CB28CH17 - Brodsky ARI 13 July 2012 19 : 19 Hanson 2010 ) . In this pathway , ubiquitinated cargo is concentrated by interaction with the ESCRT0 component ( Hrs in mammals , vps27 in yeast ) , which recruits CHC17 clathrin into a bilayered coat . It has been proposed that the cooperative coassembly of ESCRT0 and clathrin facilitates cargo capture . To date , the morphological conﬁguration of proteins in the bilayered clathrin - containing coat has not yet been established . If clathrin is forming a typical lattice , the other layer of the coat may comprise sequestered ESCRT0 or equivalent components ( Shields & Piper 2011 ) . CHC22 Clathrin and Formation of the GLUT4 Storage Compartment The increased expression of CHC22 in hu - man myoblasts and adipocytes as they differ - entiate correlates with a tissue - speciﬁc role for the late endosome - to - TGN retrograde sorting pathway in these cell types ( Liu et al . 2001 , Vas - silopoulos et al . 2009 ) . This pathway is essential for sorting the GLUT4 glucose transporter to the insulin - responsive GSC and CHC22 deple - tionfrommusclecellspreventsformationofthe GSC . Release of GLUT4 from the GSC to the plasma membrane upon insulin signaling clears glucose from the bloodstream , after a meal , and imports glucose into muscle and fat ( Bryant et al . 2002 ) . The location of CHC22 - mediated intracellularsortingsuggeststhatCHC22isnot presentontheGLUT4 - containingvesiclesthat are released to the plasma membrane from the GSC but that CHC22 action is fundamental to sorting GLUT4 to the GSC in humans . Defects in GLUT4 membrane trafﬁc are associated with type 2 diabetes . In some insulin - resistant patients with type 2 diabetes , the GSC is expanded owing to an inability to release GLUT4 in response to insulin ( Garvey et al . 1998 ) . We have observed in three such patients that the expanded GSC is decorated with CHC22 clathrin ( Figure 6 ) ( Vassilopou - los et al . 2009 ) . This may reﬂect excessive recruitment of CHC22 by the accumulated GLUT4 cargo via accumulation of the AP1 and GGA adaptors that sort GLUT4 and bind CHC22 . There is also a possibility that excessive CHC22 assembly , or some defect in CHC22 uncoating , could lead directly to inappropriate GLUT4 sequestration . The gene for CHC22 in mice is a pseudo - gene , and based on many studies of GLUT4 trafﬁc in mouse adipocytes , it seems that CHC17 clathrin operates in sorting GLUT4 to the GSC in mice ( Bogan 2012 ) . When CHC22 is introduced as a transgene expressed in muscle and fat , it competes with mouse CHC17 , as it does in human cells . In the muscle of these transgenic animals , GLUT4 and other proteins that function with it in the GSC , such as VAMP2 and the insulin - regulated amino peptidase IRAP , accumulate in an expanded in - tracellular compartment . This expanded GSC resembles that seen in the insulin - resistant type 2 diabetic patients ( Figure 6 ) . GLUT4 surface expression on muscle is also reduced in the CHC22 - transgenic mice , and their blood glucose is elevated compared with wild - type mice . Thus , CHC22 more efﬁciently se - questers GLUT4 in the GSC of the transgenic mice , which upsets the normal balance of their CHC17 - mediated targeting pathway . These observations emphasize the sensitive nature of the GSC , which is formed or released by shift - ing dominance of endocytosis , exocytosis , and targetingpathways ( Bryantetal . 2002 ) . CHC22 perturbation of GLUT4 function in the trans - genic mice further conﬁrms its role in GLUT4 transport in humans ( Vassilopoulos et al . 2009 ) . One question is whether that role is fa - vorable or unfavorable , although phylogenetic analysis indicates that properties of CHC22 are conserved in those vertebrates that express it ( humans , other primates , dogs , and chick - ens ) ( Wakeham et al . 2005 ) ( Figure 3 ) . Having CHC22 to package GLUT4 into a GSC may help animals that eat large , glucose - containing meals by expanding their GSC capacity . Mice , which feed by chronic nibbling , may not need a robust GSC and , in fact , may be better off with - out it and without CHC22 . For early humans , when meals were less easy to come by , CHC22 regulation of GSC formation could have been favorable .

Trans - Golgi Network and Golgi Functions of Clathrin There are multiple well - deﬁned roles for clathrin in the TGN , ranging from sorting lysosomal enzymes to contributing to mat - uration of secretory granules by removal of constitutively expressed proteins ( Figure 1 ) ( Brodsky et al . 2001 ) . While CCVs do not mediate intra - Golgi sorting or transport , recent studies have implicated clathrin in Golgi - complex integrity .

CB28CH17 - Brodsky ARI 13 July 2012 19 : 19 after drug - induced fragmentation ( Radulescu et al . 2007 ) and fragmentation during mitosis ( Radulescu & Shields 2012 ) . This may be the result of a requirement for clathrin - mediated membrane trafﬁc to deliver needed proteins that mediate Golgi - stack fusion . Alternatively , clathrin could be playing an as - yet - undeﬁned role in promoting Golgi - complex assembly . INTERACTIONS WITH THE ACTIN AND TUBULIN CYTOSKELETON The multivalency of the clathrin triskelion and the formation of the clathrin lattice en - able clathrin to contribute to the organization of both the actin and tubulin cytoskeletons . These clathrin - cytoskeleton interactions rep - resent novel functions for clathrin that extend beyond its conventional role as an organizing coat protein that forms vesicles or patches to sort cargo . Clathrin as an Actin Organizer The clathrin - actin connection , mediated by Hip ( Sla2p ) proteins binding to CLCs , con - tributes to conventional clathrin - mediated en - docytosis and to a role for the clathrin lattice in organizing actin at larger membrane interfaces , including those formed during bacterial and vi - ral infection . Actin plays an indispensable role in yeast clathrin - mediated endocytosis , which must counteract membrane tension imposed by the yeast cell wall ( Boettner et al . 2012 ) . The role of actin in mammalian CCV - mediated en - docytosis has been much debated . In polarized mammalian cells , or when tension is applied to mammalian cell membranes , clathrin - mediated endocytosis is dependent on actin and the avail - ability of CLC to interact with Hip proteins ( Boulant et al . 2011 ) . In both yeast and mam - malian cells , CLC is needed to recruit Hip pro - teins to a forming coated vesicle , but the inﬂu - ence of Hip proteins on actin dynamics occurs at a late stage of vesicle invagination . During CCV invagination , there must be a switch be - tween Hip - CLC binding and Hip - membrane binding to localize actin binding by Hip pro - teinsatthevesicleneck ( Figure 5 ) ( Wilburetal . 2008 ) . The nature of this switch is not com - pletely clear . But in Dictyostelium , Hip1R phos - phorylation , involving epsin , is required for actin activity during endocytosis ( Brady et al . 2010 ) . The switch may also be a function of clathrin assembly because Hip proteins bind to aCLCsequence ( Chen & Brodsky2005 ) , which is exposed by conformational changes that oc - cur during assembly . When dissociated from CLC , Hip likely cooperates with other actin regulators that are recruited to the CCV neck .

Although endocytosis of transferrin and epidermal growth factor receptor from mem - branes without high surface tension can pro - ceed in the absence of CLC ( Huang et al . 2004 , Poupon et al . 2008 ) , electron microscopy of actin localization during mammalian CCV for - mation shows consistent presence of actin at the CCV neck ( Collins et al . 2011 ) . Thus , CLC , Hip , and actin are likely to be routine players in mammalian CCV - mediated endocytosis , as they are in yeast . At the ends of coated tubules in the TGN , interactions between CHC17 at the edge of the coat and the CYFIP proteins , which are part of an actin - organizing complex , contribute to actin - based extension of tubules ( Anitei et al . 2010 ) . Several studies suggest a role for the clathrin lattice in actin organization that is distinct from recruitment for vesicle scission . During cellular invasion by Listeria or pedestal formation by enteropathic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) , clathrin and actin accumulate at the pathogen host interface , whichfarexceedsthesizeofaconven - tional CCV . Listeria internalization and EPEC binding are accompanied by SRC - family kinase phosphorylation of CHC . This modiﬁcation is required for actin accumulation and also de - pends on CLC and Hip proteins ( Bonazzi et al . 2011 ) ( Figure 6 ) . Electron microscopy shows that the pathogen - host interface comprises clathrin - coated pits but no vesicles . Thus CHC phosphorylation may stabilize clathrin - coated pits at sites of infection , where they can serve as platforms for actin organization , which can lead to organism internalization or to adhesion followed by pedestal formation . Uptake of large viral particles also requires clathrin and actin and may occur through a similar mechanism ( Cureton et al . 2010 ) . The im - munological synapse represents another large membrane interface at which actin recruit - ment is clathrin dependent ( Calabia - Linares et al . 2011 ) . Ligand engagement of T cell receptors ( and B cell receptors ) that participate in forming such interfaces induces clathrin phosphorylation ( Crotzer et al . 2004 , Stoddart et al . 2002 ) , so phosphorylated CHC17 may also function as an actin organizer in this context . CHC17 clathrin has been implicated in cell migration , but whether this involves conventional membrane trafﬁc and / or actin - organizing functions has not yet been clariﬁed fully . Overexpression of CLCb in tissue culture cells reduces migration , and overexpression of mutant CLCb that cannot bind Hip enhances migration ( Saffarian et al . 2009 ) . Depletion of CHC from cells inhibits migration , and Ezratty et al . ( 2009 ) ascribed this to inhibition of in - tegrin endocytosis and interference with focal - adhesionturnover . CHC17hasalsobeenimpli - cated in recruitment of the Scar / Wave complex totheplasmamembraneduringlamellopodium formation ( Gautier et al . 2011 ) . Thus clathrin is poised to play multiple roles in cell migration that remain to be deﬁned . Clathrin Interaction with Microtubules and Cell Cycle Function In mammalian cells , CHC17 clathrin localizes to the mitotic spindle ( Figure 6 ) ( reviewed in Royle 2012 ) . Spindle - associated clathrin is not membrane bound . Instead , CHC17 forms a complex with the microtubule - binding pro - tein TACC3 and the ch - TOG protein , both of which have roles in microtubule growth and stabilization . CHC17 binding to TACC3 de - pends on TACC3 phosphorylation by Aurora A kinase , which is activated at the onset of mito - sis . During normal cell division , CHC22 is not associated with the mitotic spindle ( Esk et al . 2010 ) ( Figure 6 ) . The TACC3 - ch - TOG - CHC17 complex plays a role in stabilizing kinetochore ﬁbers . ( Royle 2012 ) . These ﬁbers , which extend from the kinetochore to the centrosome , function in chromosome segregation and are composed of bundled microtubules . Protein bridges be - tween microtubules within these bundles are reduced in the absence of CHC17 ( Royle 2012 ) . The TACC3 - ch - TOG - CHC17 com - plex is also present at centrosomes and , dur - ing early mitosis , contributes to centrosome 17 . 18 Brodsky Changes may still occur before final publication online and in print A nnu .

Clathrin has been observed on spindles of human , rat , mouse , pig , frog , and plant cells . However , TACC3 is less conserved than clathrin in the eukaryotic lineage and ch - TOG is variable in its domain structure between species . Thus the microtubule stabilization role for CHC17 may be a true case of moonlight - ing that emerged by recent evolution . TACC3 binding to CHC17 is similar to the imprint of adaptor binding , which suggests that evolution - ary changes in existing binding sites generated speciﬁcity for TACC3 . Though the phylogeny and function of the TACC3 - ch - TOG - CHC17 complex is not fully deﬁned , its roles in spin - dle microtubule stabilization and centrosome integrity indicate that the complex functions at multiple phases of the cell cycle . CHC17 also plays a role in endosomal membrane trafﬁc during mitotic cell expansion and abscission , a process in which CHC22 is implicated as well ( Foraker et al . 2012 , Royle 2012 ) . TOOLS TO STUDY CLATHRIN : INHIBITORS AND TAGS There are a variety of inhibitors of clathrin function , but none are absolutely reliable or globally applicable to all investigations ( as reviewed by McMahon & Boucrot 2011 ) . Chemical treatments such as acidiﬁcation , potassium depletion , hypotonic shock , and chlorpromazine or small molecule inhibitors such as Brefeldin A , Dynasore , Dyngo - 4A , and Pitstops that can be added to cells have the advantage that they function shortly after the diffusion across the plasma membrane . They also have the disadvantage of potential pleiotropic effects . This is more worrisome in the case of chemical treatments . The Pitstops are relatively new small molecule inhibitors designed to inhibit clathrin TD binding to a clathrin box motif ( von Kleist et al . 2011 ) . These are potent inhibitors of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . However , their effects on nonendocytic functions of clathrin , and the possibility of unforeseen pleiotropic effects , are not fully characterized , as these compounds have become available for use only recently . There are some puzzling aspects of the Pitstops’ effects , reviewed in Lemmon & Traub ( 2012 ) . While Dynasore ( Macia et al . 2006 ) and Dyngo - 4A ( Harper et al . 2011 ) effec - tively target dynamin , users must be aware that dynamin also plays a role in other membrane trafﬁc pathways that do not involve clathrin . Effective depletion of CHC17 , CLC , and CHC22 by siRNA ( or shRNA ) ( Esk et al . 2010 , Royle & Lagnado 2006 ) , or deple - tion of AP2 for more speciﬁc focus on the endocytic clathrin pathway ( Huang et al . 2004 ) , requires 48 – 72 hours to overcome long protein half - lives ( Brodsky 1985 ) . Within this time , cells can potentially compensate for the lost pathway , though clathrin - mediated endocytosis is dramatically reduced by CHC17 and AP2 depletion . Expression of dominant - negative fragments of clathrin is effective but limited by stoichiometric expression require - ments and protein turnover times ( Liu et al . 1998 ) . Clathrin deletion mutants in yeast , Drosophila , worms , and Dictyostelium provide non - mammalian systems in which to study clathrin function , with the same caveat that compensatory pathways might arise . Therearethreenon - chemicalapproachesto cellular inactivation of clathrin - mediated pro - cesses within a short time frame . The ﬁrst was the development of temperature - sensitive al - leles in yeast , which have been reproduced in worms and mammalian cells ( Lemmon et al . 1991 , Neumann - Staubitz et al . 2010 , Sato et al . 2009 , Seeger & Payne 1992 ) . Secondly , mam - malian cell lines and Drosophila have been engineered to express modiﬁed CLCs that can be crosslinked by cell - permeable bivalent compounds ( Foraker et al . 2012 , Moskowitz et al . 2003 ) or by light exposure ( Heerssen et al . 2008 ) . These treatments effectively in - hibit clathrin activity , but their use is limited to cells or organisms that permanently express the modiﬁed CLCs .

This strategy also depends on using permanently transfected cell lines . Clathrin dynamics are studied widely in cells expressing CLCa with a GFP tag at the N ter - minus . Tracking CLCa - GFP has been infor - mative about the relative dynamics of clathrin assemblies at the plasma membrane and the rel - ative recruitment of accessory proteins . How - ever , three issues should be considered in inter - preting results using this construct . First , we do notyetknowthefunctionaldifferencesbetween CLCa and CLCb , so a potentially skewed view of clathrin behavior might result from studying CLCa only . Second , the GFP tag is appended to the N terminus , which has dual functions in controlling clathrin assembly and binding to Hip proteins . A study comparing GFP - tagged CLCa with biochemically ﬂuorescinated CLCa showed that their in vivo dynamics were differ - entandthatCLCa - GFPdidnothavetheability to control in vitro clathrin assembly ( Hoffmann et al . 2010 ) . Third , using CLCs as an example , Doyon et al . ( 2011 ) showed that altering levels of expression of exogenous protein constructs can change their observed behavior . Studies of other tagged CCV components should take similar concerns into account . ROLES FOR CLATHRIN IN HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE Historical interest in the relevance of clathrin - mediated endocytosis to human disease traces back to the work of Brown , Goldstein , and An - derson . They showed that mutant low - density lipoprotein receptors that are defective in adap - tor recognition for sequestration in CCVs are a genetic cause of hypercholesterolemia and heart disease ( Goldstein et al . 1985 ) . CHC17 clathrinisanessentialproteinthatishighlycon - served . No human diseases have yet emerged with genetic defects in CHC17 or either CLC . Although anecdotal , this survey could be taken as evidence that defects in these proteins might be lethal . In contrast , genetic defects or expres - sion changes in many adaptors and CLASPs , though not AP1 or AP2 , are associated with a variety of neurological syndromes ( reviewed in McMahon & Boucrot 2011 ) . These asso - ciations are not surprising because clathrin plays a major role in synaptic vesicle recycling , and there are many neuron - speciﬁc variants of CLASPs . As mentioned above , CHC22 clathrin has more polymorphic variants than CHC17 in the human population . Given the critical role of CHC22 in human glucose metabolism , it is conceivable that some of these variants might have an association with type 2 diabetes . Min - imally , CHC22 has potential as a diagnostic marker of expanded GLUT4 compartments that occur during insulin resistance ( Figure 6 ) ( Vassilopoulos et al . 2009 ) . CHC22 clathrin has been observed at higher - than - normal levels in regeneratingmuscle ( Towleretal . 2004 ) , which implicates CHC22 - mediated membrane trafﬁc and its role in glucose metabolism in recovery from muscle injury . Clathrin - mediated pathways play a role in both the etiology of infectious disease and immune - system function . Clathrin - mediated endosomal sorting targets Class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) and their accessory proteins ( invariant chain and HLA - DM ) to the intracellular endocytic compartment where they bind pathogen peptides for presentation to T cells ( Liu et al . 1998 ) . Some pathogens evade the immune response by targeting immune receptors for ubiquitination , which results in receptor downregulation by clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Randow & Lehner 2009 ) . Other pathogens use clathrin - mediated pathways for cell infection including viruses and bacteria , as mentioned above . Clathrin plays a role in intracellular HIV maturation and in assembly of other retroviral particles ( Zhang et al . 2011 ) . For these viruses , incorporation of cytosolic clathrin during budding is proposed to con - tribute to the organization of viral proteins for efﬁcient proteolytic processing . Also critical to the success of HIV infection is clathrin - mediated sorting of the Nef gene product , which binds clathrin adaptors and causes downregulation of Class I MHC and CD4 17 . 20 Brodsky Changes may still occur before final publication online and in print A nnu .

Clathrin - mediated pathways are linked inti - mately to oncogenesis and to amyloid forma - tion in neurodegenerative diseases . Disruption of clathrin - mediated pathways affects the local - ization of both substrates and enzymes in the membrane - associated proteolytic pathways for amyloid generation and Notch processing , as well as clearance of pathogenic products ( Huse & Doms 2001 , Lambert & Amouyel 2011 , Prox et al . 2011 , Sorensen & Conner 2010 ) . Overex - pression of Numb , a CLASP involved in Notch trafﬁcking , is associated with breast cancer pro - gression ( Pece et al . 2011 ) . Additionally , many oncogenes are trafﬁcked by clathrin - mediated pathways , so changes in these pathways can also inﬂuence tumorogenesis . For example , the β 1 - subunit of AP1 is a reported tumor suppres - sor gene ( Peyrard et al . 1994 ) . Furthermore , chromosomal translocations that link CHC17 to oncogenic partners occur in rare B cell and T cell lymphomas ( Blixt & Royle 2011 ) . Lastly , the unconventional functions of clathrin and Hip proteins in centrosome and spindle integrity , actin organization , and nu - clear translocation impinge on pathways of cell cycle control , metastasis , and transcriptional regulation , all of which contribute to oncoge - nesis and tumor progression . In this context , there are intriguing hints of nuclear roles for clathrin and Hip proteins . CHC monomers are reportedtobindnuclearp53andinﬂuencegene transcription , whereas Hip1 can bind andro - gen receptor and also is translocated to the nu - cleus ( Borlido et al . 2009 , Ohmori et al . 2008 ) . Hip1 is overexpressed in metastatic breast and prostate cancer and can induce tumorogene - sis , but it is not yet clear whether these effects are related to the clathrin - associated or nuclear functions of Hip1 ( Hyun & Ross 2004 ) . Fur - ther characterization of the roles of clathrin - mediated pathways in human physiology not only will lead to better understanding of dis - ease mechanisms but also might reveal speciﬁc clathrin - binding interactions to target for de - velopment of therapeutics . CONCLUSION Clathrin’s multimeric properties and ability to self - assemble enable its conventional func - tion as a sorting coat to organize receptors and bend lipids . These properties also enable an actin - organizing function and microtubule - stabilizing function that diversify clathrin’s roles in cells as well as make clathrin a prime candidate for exploitation as a nanomaterial . Further diversiﬁcation of clathrin function arose by gene duplication in vertebrates , lead - ing to a second form of CHC with a speciﬁc role in human glucose metabolism and poten - tial signiﬁcance for type 2 diabetes . The gene duplication leading to CLC diversity likely di - versiﬁes clathrin function further , and under - standing the functions of the different forms of CLCs is one of the next frontiers in clathrin biology ( see below ) . Lastly , conventional and diversiﬁed clathrin functions have signiﬁcance for infectious disease , cancer , and metabolism as well as heart and neurological disease . FUTURE ISSUES 1 .
