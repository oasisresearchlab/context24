Schlüsselwörter : Wachstumsfaktoren , Minipig , Platelet - rich Plasma Introduction Platelet - rich plasma ( PRP ) has gained importance in the treatment of various osteopathies in human and animals [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , since the α - granules of the platelets are rich in growth factors such as the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) and transforming growth factor β ( TGF - β ) , which play a key role in tissue healing [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] . In vivo studies have shown that growth factors are present during the healing of osseous defects and fractures [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] . However , the role of growth factors , their localization and their specific characteristics are dis - cussed controversially [ 1 ] , [ 10 ] . Some of the bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) , which belong to the su - perfamily of the TGF - β , have the potential to induce formation of new bone [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] . In vivo studies have also revealed the influence of TGF - β on the healing of fractures [ 13 ] . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) is stored and secreted by endothelium and osteoblasts and plays a major role in angiogenesis during repair of osseous defects [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , whereas platelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ) is released from the platelets during the formation of haematoma and stimulates the migration of osteoblasts and mesenchymal progenitor cells [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] . The knowledge about the existing growth factors in platelet - rich plasma ( PRP ) and their osteoinductive char - acteristics make the use of PRP produced from patient’s own blood in a point of care device a possible successful method to provide a sustained release of growth factors and promote bone healing . Despite the increased interest in the mini - pig in experi - mental medicine [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] and especially in ortho - pedics [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] little is known about the presence and concentration of growth factors for this species . The aim of the present investigation was to study the concentra - tion of platelets and of selected growth factors in PRP preparations of minipigs in order to characterize it as a possible autologous source of growth factors . Our findings identified an increase in the concentration of the growth factors in PRP for this animal model . Materials and methods Animals Eighteen to thirty months old , 25 – 35 kg Goettinger minipigs ( n = 16 ) were used in this study . The use of the animals was approved by the local Animal Care and Use Committee of the Heinrich - Heine - University and local government Duesseldorf , Germany ( protocol number : 50 . 05 - 230 - 78 / 06 ) . A priori power analysis was per - formed . This resulted in a sample size of 16 for a power of 80 % with a p value of 0 . 05 determining significance . Preparation of platelet - rich plasma PRP was prepared from whole blood collected under an - aesthesia from the jugular vein of each mini - pig . Anaes - thesia was performed using intravenous 0 . 5 g thiopental ( Inresa Arzneimittel GmbH , Freiburg , Germany ) after in - tramuscular sedation with 0 . 5 mg / kg atropine ( Atropin - sulfat , B Braun , Melsungen , Germany ) , 5 mg / kg azaperon ( Stresnil , Janssen - Cilag GmbH Neuss , Germany ) and 10 mg / kg ketamin ( Ketavet , Pharmacia GmbH , Karlsruhe , Germany ) . PRP was prepared using the centrifugation based “Gravitional - Platelet - Systems GPS ® II Platelet Separation System” ( Biomet Biologics , Warsaw , IN , USA ) . Two syringes were filled with 6 ml of citrate anticoagulant ( Anticoagulant Citrate Dextrose Solution , Biomet Biologics ) and 54 ml of whole blood each . The mixture was centri - fuged for 15 min at 3200 rpm and the platelet - poor plasma ( PPP ) was separated from the PRP . To obtain the necessary autologous thrombin for the activation of the thrombocytes , two 10 ml syringes were filled with 7 ml whole blood and centrifuged for 2 . 5 min at 3200 rpm . The resulting 4 ml supernatant containing the autologous thrombin was mixed with 1 ml of 10 % calcium chloride . The PRP was activated by mixing the thrombin solution with the PRP in a ratio of 1 : 10 . Immediate clotting of the solution within 2 min proved the activation of the plate - lets . The resulting activated PRP was used for further in - vestigations . Blood was collected for plasma and serum 2 / 8 GMS Interdisciplinary Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery DGPW 2014 , Vol . 3 , ISSN 2193 - 8091 Jungbluth et al . : Concentration of platelets and growth factors in platelet - rich . . . samples , in an EDTA and a serum separator tube respect - ively . Subsequently the serum was allowed to clot for 30 min at room temperature . The plasma and serum samples were then harvested after centrifugation for 15 min at 3 , 200 rpm . Aliquots of activated PRP , plasma and serum were conserved at - 80°C for further measure - ments of growth factors . Determination of platelet concentrations in whole blood and PRP The platelets concentrations in inactivated PRP and native EDTA blood were analyzed in an automatic counter ( ADVIAs 120 , Bayer Diagnostics GmbH , Leverkusen , Germany ) using veterinary software adapted to pig blood cells . Determination of growth factors concentrations in plasma and PRP To determine the concentrations of TGF - β1 , BMP - 2 , BMP - 7 and VEGF in plasma and activated PRP , respectively in serum and activated PRP for PDGF - bb , the appropriate ELISA tests ( Quantikine ® ELISA - Kits ; R & D Systems Min - neapolis , MN , USA ) were used as recommended by the manufacturer . With the exception of porcine TGF - β1 , all other ELISAs were validated for human samples only . Monoclonal antibodies specific for the growth factors were used as capture antibodies and the horseradish - peroxidase - linked polyclonal antibodies directed against the growth factors served as detection antibodies . Diluted plasma / serum and PRP samples or standards with de - creasing concentrations of recombinant growth factors were added into the plates which were incubated for two hours at room temperature . Subsequently , the plates were washed and the detection antibodies were added to the plates for two hours . After a further washing step the peroxidase activity was measured , using tetramethyl - benzidine as a substrate . After 30 min the reaction was stopped by adding an acid solution , and the absorbance at 450 nm was recorded photometrically by a multilabel plate reader ( Victor X3 , Perkin - Elmer , Rodgau , Germany ) . Growth factor concentrations were calculated based on the standard curve obtained with recombinant standard growth factors and results were expressed in pg / ml . The minimum detectable dose was settled at 11 pg / ml for BMP - 2 and BMP - 7 , 9 pg / ml for VEGF and 15 pg / ml for TGF - β1 and PDGF - bb . The fold increasing between the non - enriched and the enriched preparations was calcu - lated by dividing the mean values of the enriched samples by the mean values of the corresponding non - enriched groups . Statistical analysis The statistical analysis was performed using a commer - cially available software program ( SPSS 19 . 0 , SPSS Inc . , Chicago , IL , USA ) . Mean values ( n = 16 ) and standard de - viations were calculated for each parameter . For the statistical comparisons between the non - enriched and PRP groups , the unpaired t - test was used . For correlation analysis of growth factors concentration with platelet counts , linear regression was performed between the X and Y axis using Statistica 7 . 1 ( Statistica for Windows , version 7 . 1 , http : / / www . statsoft . com ) . A p value < 0 . 05 was considered significant . Results Platelet concentration in PRP Platelet concentrations in freshly collected EDTA blood varied inter - individually between 198 and 522 x 10 3 / mm 3 ( mean 401 . 75±79 . 25 ) platelets . In the PRP samples the platelet concentration increased significantly ( p < 0 . 01 ) and ranged between 995 and 3 , 330 x 10 3 / mm 3 ( 1 , 869 . 9±511 . 1 ) platelets ( Figure 1 ) . On average a 4 . 65 - fold concentration increase could be measured . Figure 1 : Quantification of platelets in EDTA - blood and inactivated platelet - rich plasma of minipigs .

In con - trast to BMP - 2 variable amounts of BMP - 7 ranging from 72 . 2 to 178 . 5 pg / ml ( 83 . 2±25 . 7 ) were determined in plasma . The concentration of BMP - 7 in PRP samples varied between 84 and 433 pg / ml ( 125 . 2±83 . 7 ) , result - ing in a 1 . 5 - fold increase in comparison to plasma ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 2B ) . TGF - β1 in plasma of native blood showed a range between 1 , 187 and 22 , 015 pg / ml ( 5 , 606±5 , 669 ) and varied in PRP between 23 , 625 and 46 , 745 pg / ml ( 39 , 637±6 , 014 ) . Hence , the concentration of TGF - β1 in - creased significantly ( p < 0 . 01 ) by 7 . 1 - fold in PRP com - pared to plasma of native blood ( Figure 2C ) .

Each point on the graph represents an individual mini - pig value . samples VEGF could be measured ( range 23 . 1 to 221 . 7 pg / ml ; mean 70 . 9±49 . 1 ) achieving an increase of 7 . 2 ( p < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 2D ) . Evident levels of PDGF - bb in serum of native blood were measured in 11 of 16 samples and varied between 44 and 535 pg / ml ( 152 . 8±183 . 42 ) . On the other hand , all PRP samples contained variable PDGF - bb concentrations ( range 8 , 619 to 22 , 577 pg / ml ; 15 , 795±4 , 118 ) , resulting in a 103 . 3 - fold increase ( p < 0 . 01 ) in comparison to plasma ( Figure 2E ) . Excepting the BMP - 7 concentration which did not correl - ate with the platelet count ( r = 0 . 12 , p > 0 . 05 ) , a positive correlation was found between platelets and the concen - trations of BMP - 2 ( r = 0 . 62 , p < 0 . 001 ) ( details not shown ) , TGF - β1 ( r = 0 . 85 , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 3A ) , VEGF ( r = 0 . 46 , p < 0 . 01 ) ( details not shown ) and PDGF - bb ( r = 0 . 9 , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 3B ) . Discussion Using a systematic approach we monitored the concen - tration of platelets and selected growth factors in plasma / serum versus PRP in minipigs . Several studies examined the effects of PRP in various orthopedic exper - imental approaches in minipigs [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] . After morphological examination some of the groups re - ported beneficial effects such as enhancement of bone formation and osseointegration of dental implants [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 26 ] whereas others did not observed significant effects [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 27 ] of the PRP . The beneficial effects of the PRP rely probably on the delivery of increased concentration of growth factors . However , a detailed ex - amination of platelets and growth factors concentration in the PRP preparations used in these studies was not performed making a conclusion regarding the effects of PRP in this species difficult . Despite the increasing use of PRP in veterinary medicine , its cellular as well as the molecular composition is not defined for most of the animal species . Recently the concentration of platelets and selected growth factors was reported in canine conditioned plasma [ 28 ] as well as in horse PRP [ 29 ] . In minipigs , we obtained comparable amounts of TGF - β1 and PDGF - bb with the horse [ 29 ] but higher concentrations in comparison with the ones in dogs [ 28 ] , indicating that the plasma enrichment and activation methods influence the amounts of available growth factors . In the present study , the platelet concentrations in PRP samples of minipigs increased significantly in comparison to whole blood assuming an increased concentration of growth factors . Our findings showed that indeed the in - crease in the platelet count resulted in increased concen - trations of the growth factors in PRP supporting the pre - viously reported correlation between platelet count and concentration of platelet derived growth factors [ 5 ] . The level of BMP - 2 , BMP - 7 , TGF - β1 , VEGF and PDGF - bb elev - ated to 17 . 6 , 1 . 5 , 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 and 103 . 3 fold in activated PRP in comparison to the correspondent non - enriched preparations in our study . Except the BMP - 7 , all other parameters tested correlated significantly with the platelets count . These findings are in accord with Sund - man et al . [ 30 ] who demonstrated that human TGF - β1 and PDGF concentrations correlate with the platelet count supporting their presence in the α - granules of the plate - lets [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 31 ] . Additionally , we proved that also BMP - 2 and VEGF level correlated with the platelet counts . Wahlstrom et al . showed that PDGF , TGF - β , and VEGF were present in all platelet preparations but the levels varied in a pH dependent fashion [ 32 ] . They also found out that BMP - 2 was only detected in acidic preparation ( pH 4 . 3 ) suggesting that the platelets release substantial amounts of BMP - 2 only under conditions of low pH , the milieu associated with the critical initial stage of fracture healing [ 32 ] . These results show that the release of such factors is a multifactorial phenomenon with specific pe - culiarities for each molecule and might explain our mod - est elevation of BMP - 7 in PRP and its lack of correlation with the platelet count . 5 / 8 GMS Interdisciplinary Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery DGPW 2014 , Vol . 3 , ISSN 2193 - 8091 Jungbluth et al . : Concentration of platelets and growth factors in platelet - rich . . . The absence of validated commercial animal specific kits for the detection of growth factors might explain why such parameters are not yet characterized for experimental animals . Interestingly , although some of the ELISA tests used were validated for human use only they seemed to provide reliable results with mini - pig samples since comparable values with the one from humans were ob - tained [ 30 ] indicating that they are highly cross - reactive with the porcine growth factors which are assumed to be very similar with the human ones . The specific physiological effects of the growth factors are well defined . BMPs induce the differentiation of ma - ture mesenchymal stem cells into bone - and cartilage - forming cells . BMP - 2 and BMP - 7 belong to the TGF - β su - perfamily of proteins and have been shown to be benefi - cial in the treatment of a variety of bone - related condi - tions including delayed union and non - union [ 33 ] . In contrast to the delivery of recombinant BMP - 2 and BMP - 7 , PRP with its autologous origin does not cause any risk of allergies and graft versus host reactions [ 26 ] . TGF - β family of cytokines has been intensively studied [ 34 ] . TGF - β is produced in platelets and macrophages [ 35 ] and can act as a paracrine as well as an autocrine growth factor . The most important functions of TGF - β seem to be on one hand chemotaxis and mitogenesis of osteo - blasts [ 36 ] and on the other inhibition of the formation of osteoclasts and bone resorption [ 37 ] . VEGF is stored and secreted by endothelium and osteoblasts and plays a major role in angiogenesis during repair of fractures [ 14 ] . PDGF is released from the platelets during the formation of haematoma and stimulates the migration of osteoblasts and mesenchymal progenitor cells [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] . Conclusion Taken together , the sufficient number of samples as well as the optimal enrichment in the number of platelets in PRP in comparison to native blood allowed us to docu - ment also an increase in the concentration of growth factors . In conclusion the preparation and application of PRP represents an easy method to provide autologous growth factors during surgery in experimental models in minipigs . Due to its autologous origin PRP is an attractive alternative to synthetic preparations without the risk of hypersensitivity and graft reactions versus host reactions .
