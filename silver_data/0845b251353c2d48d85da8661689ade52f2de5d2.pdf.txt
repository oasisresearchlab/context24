Many spectroscopic studies have been performed in solution , but studies on single actin filaments have just begun . Here , we show that the time course of polymerization of individual filaments consists of a polymerization phase and a sub - sequent steady - state phase . During the steady - state phase , a treadmilling process of elongation at the barbed end and shortening at the pointed end occurs , in which both components of the process proceed at approximately the same rate . The time correlation of length fluctuation of the filaments in the steady - state phase showed that the polymerization – depolymerization dynamics follow a diffusion ( stochastic ) process , which cannot be explained by simple association and dissociation of monomers at both ends of the filaments . T o date , there have been many physico - chemical studies of actin polymerization , all of which have been performed in solution . These studies have demonstrated that the polymer - ization of actin consists of nucleation and growth followed by a steady - state phase , where fragmentation and annealing of filaments may also occur . The average kinetics and thermodynamics of the overall process , and essential elements of these processes , have been experimentally clarified and theoretically formulated 1 , 2 . Electron microscopy showed that in common with microtubules , actin fila - ments have a structural polarity , such that the kinetics of polymer - ization and depolymerization at the two ends of the filaments are different 2 – 6 . The end of the filaments at which the polymerization rate is higher is called the ‘barbed end’ . The other end is referred to as the ‘pointed end’ . After steady - state polymerization is attained , a treadmilling process is thought to occur 7 . Filament assembly occurs at the barbed end of filaments , whereas depolymerization occurs at the pointed end . This process ensures that the filament maintains a constant average length . The treadmilling process has been exam - ined experimentally in solution 7 , 8 . When the rate of polymerization is greater than the rate of ATP hydrolysis , ATP - bound actin molecules should cap the ends of the filaments 8 . Depending on whether each end of the actin filaments is capped by ATP - bound actin ( ATP cap ) or ADP - bound actin ( ADP cap ) , the dynamics of the filaments are predicted to be dif - ferent , resulting in so - called ‘dynamic instability’under appropriate conditions 8 , 9 . However , in contrast to microtubules 10 , 11 , such a dynamic instability has not yet been demonstrated experimentally with actin filaments . Thus , the examination of whether such a dynamic process occurs with actin is still a challenging problem . In the 1980s , it became possible to visualize single actin fila - ments under the fluorescence microscope through labelling with rhodamine – phalloidin ( Rh – Ph ) 12 or by directly labelling actin with a fluorescent dye , fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) , and stabilizing the filament with phalloidin 13 . Phalloidin is added to suppress the depolymerization of actin filaments so that they can be imaged at extremely low actin concentrations . This technique is very useful for stable and clear visualization of filaments under a conventional fluorescence microscope , without disturbance of background fluo - rescence 14 , 15 . Using this technique , we have previously examined the polymerization process of single actin filaments 16 . In the present study , we have used actin directly labelled with a fluorescent dye . This overcomes the disadvantage of using phal - loidin , which suppresses depolymerization . In addition , we have used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy , which enabled us to study not only the polymerization process , but also the depolymerization process of individual actin filaments under standard polymerization conditions . This technique was recently applied to a study on the polymerization process of single actin fil - aments in the presence of the Arp2 / 3 complex 17 , 18 . Here , not only do we demonstrate the treadmilling process on single actin fila - ments , but we also extend previous studies by identifying new aspects of the polymerization – depolymerization dynamics of actin . Results Direct observation of the polymerization process of single actin filaments . Figure 1 shows direct observation of the actin ( Ca ) poly - merization process , which was induced by the addition of poly - merization buffer ( potassium chloride and magnesium chloride ) . Although all the filaments examined were still short at 6 min after the addition of salts ( Fig . 1a ) , most had elongated by more than 10 µ m and the total number of filaments had increased after a further 34 min ( Fig . 1b ) . It is clear that most of the filaments grew gradu - ally with time ( Fig . 1c – q ) . Transverse Brownian movement of actin filaments was suppressed by addition of methylcellulose , although longitudinal Brownian movement was not . It seems that there are two types of filament : those that elongated significantly ( Fig . 1 , white arrows ) and those that did not ( Fig . 1 , arrowheads ) . For the initial 30 min of observation , approximately 12 % of the filaments showed no elongation ( 0 . 7 µ M G - actin ( Ca ) ; n = 212 ) . This may be attributed to adhesion of ( or interference with ) the fil - ament ends to the glass surface and / or entanglement with methyl - cellulose , as the proportion of actin filaments that did not elongate detectably was not as high in our previous experiments with Rh – Ph 16 , in which methylcellulose was not included . Next , we examined the time course of change in the total length of individual actin filaments after the addition of salts at 0 . 3 µ M ( Fig . 2a ) , 0 . 5 µ M ( Fig . 2b ) and 0 . 7 µ M ( Fig . 2c ) actin . It is clear that the polymerization process of each filament consists of a polymeriza - tion phase and a subsequent steady - state phase ( Fig . 2c ) . These two phases were not easily distinguishable at lower actin concentrations . © 2002 Nature Publishing Group articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 4 SEPTEMBER 2002 www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 667 It is notable , especially in Fig . 2c , that the time at which the steady - state phase began varied between filaments . In both phases , all the actin filaments displayed small fluctuations in length . We did not observe any filaments that only underwent depolymerization or displayed any dynamic instability 10 , 11 , as previously observed for microtubules . Occasionally , a large change in length , as a result of head - to - tail annealing of two filaments 4 ( longer than a few microns ) , was observed . However , these data were not used for the analysis described below , as we focused on the polymerization – depolymer - ization dynamics at both ends of the filaments . We did not observe spontaneous fragmentation of actin filaments , as observed in the presence of gelsolin 16 . Generally , a fluorescence image of an actin filament ( that is , an intensity profile along the filament ) is not uniform . Indeed , we detected fluorescent blobs at fixed positions on the filaments ( Fig . 1 , yellow arrows ) . Using a blob as a fiducial marker , we measured the length of the filament portions on each side of the fluorescent mark - er ( Fig . 2d ) . These measurements show that after the steady - state phase was attained , the filament continued growing at one end , whereas it began to shorten correspondingly at the other end . We assign the former as the barbed end and the latter as the pointed end , on the basis of the known difference in critical concentration for the two ends of the filament . This result demonstrates that the treadmilling process can occur on an individual actin filament . Among the data at 0 . 7 µ M actin ( Ca ) , we found seven examples that had a bright marker sufficient for quantitative analysis of the poly - merization process at each end of the filament . At the steady - state phase , the polymerization rate averaged over these seven cases was + 0 . 069 ± 0 . 037 µ m min − 1 ( ± standard deviation , S . D . ) at the fast - growing end ( barbed end ) , − 0 . 062 ± 0 . 051 µ m min − 1 at the slow - growing end ( pointed end ) and 0 . 006 ± 0 . 062 µ m min − 1 for the total length of the filaments . This confirms that on average , the growing rate at the barbed end was compensated by the shortening rate at the pointed end . However , the growing and the shortening rates did not necessarily coincide with each other in each filament , at least within the time range we examined ( 8 – 30 min ) . As a control , the time course of length change in a single actin filament at steady state in the presence of phalloidin was deter - mined ( Fig . 2e ) . Phalloidin was added to a final concentration of 150 nM , which is equal to the actin concentration and higher than the dissociation constant of phalloidin to actin ( 17 nM ) 19 . Estimation of the polymerization rate of actin ( Ca ) during the polymerization phase . To determine the relationship between the polymerization rate and actin concentration , we analysed the change in length of actin filaments for 6 min after commencing microscopic observation . This represents the polymerization rate of actin during the initial polymerization phase ( Fig . 2 ) . We failed to record the earliest initial phase of polymerization ; however , the polymerization rate estimated from our measurements is reliable , as linear extrapolation of our data passes through the origin ( zero length at time zero ) . The change in length was measured at 1 - min intervals for the ini - tial 6 - min observation period ( Fig . 2 ) . The data is presented as a his - togram , showing the distribution of the change in length at three dif - ferent concentrations of actin ( Fig . 3a – c ) . Thus , the polymerization rate obtained from the average distribution and the S . D . from the width of the distribution are estimated as 0 . 13 ± 0 . 30 µ m min − 1 , 0 . 35 ± 0 . 38 µ m min − 1 and 0 . 49 ± 0 . 46 µ m min − 1 at 0 . 3 , 0 . 5 and 0 . 7 µ M actin , respectively . The relationship between the polymerization rate and the actin concentration is summarized in Fig . 3d . On the basis that an actin filament of 1 µ m in length consists of 400 monomers , polymerization and depolymerization rate constants were estimated to be 6 . 1 × 10 6 M − 1 s − 1 and 0 . 85 s − 1 , respectively . The critical concen - tration for polymerization was determined as 0 . 14 µ M ( see Table 1 ) . Analysis of length fluctuation of actin ( Ca ) .

Fluctuations not only occurred during the polymerization phase ( where the length of the filaments increased steadily ) , but also dur - ing the steady - state phase ( where the average length of the fila - ments was almost constant ) . To examine whether this fluctuation in length could also provide information on the dynamics of poly - merization – depolymerization , we analysed the relationship between time and the fluctuation of length . The change in length during various time intervals , termed the correlation time , τ , was measured in the steady - state phase ( Fig . 4a ) . If the fluctuations in length are caused solely by random error in the measurements , then they should be independent of τ . To confirm the above hypothesis , we examined the effect of phal - lotoxin , which is expected to suppress the length change caused by depolymerization . In fact , the addition of phalloidin significantly reduced the fluctuation in length ( Fig . 2e ) . Furthermore , as expected , the width of the distribution of length fluctuation seemed to be almost independent of τ ( Fig . 4b ) . This suggests that the width of the distribution obtained for the phallotoxin - labelled actin filaments may represent the degree of error in the length measurements . By contrast , the width of the distribution of length fluctuation obtained for actin filaments without phallotoxin increased coordi - nately with τ , whereas the average of the distribution was almost zero , implying that the steady - state phase had been attained ( Fig . 4c ) . Polymerization dynamics of actin ( Mg ) . The same polymerization properties described above for actin ( Ca ) have also been shown for actin ( Mg ) 20 . In contrast to actin ( Ca ) , the resolution of length meas - urements was lower because of the lower contrast of the fluorescence image . This is probably attributable to a large background fluores - cence originating from a large number of short filaments , because nucleation occurs more easily with actin ( Mg ) . Fluorescence images of polymerized filaments taken 7 and 35 min after the addition of salts showed that the filament density seems to be higher than that of actin ( Ca ) , even if the actin concen - tration was less than half ( compare Fig . 5a with Fig . 1 ) . Furthermore , the polymerization rate constant was 1 . 0 × 10 7 M − 1 s − 1 , approximately twice that of actin ( Ca ) , and the depolymerization rate constant was 0 . 6 s − 1 ( Fig . 5b ) . The critical concentration was 0 . 064 µ M ( see Table 1 ) . Next , we analysed the length fluctuation of actin ( Mg ) filaments once the steady - state phase had been achieved ( Fig . 5c ) . As observed in Fig 5c , d , the degree of length fluctuation of actin ( Mg ) was larger than that of actin ( Ca ) ( note that the width ( S . D . ) of the distribution in Fig . 5d is greater than that in Fig . 4c ) . Polymerization dynamics of single actin filaments follow a diffusion process . We examined the polymerization and depolymerization dynamics of single actin filaments by analysing the distribution of the length fluctuation during the steady - state phase ( Figs 4c , 5d ) . If the fluctuation in length is a result of errors in measurement , it must be independent of τ . However , if it originates from the stochastic process of actin polymerization and depolymerization at both ends of the filaments , the square of the distribution width ( S . D . ) must be proportional to τ ( see ref . 21 , chapter 4 ) and its analysis will provide information on the polymerization – depolymerization dynamics , as described below . To examine this mechanism , we obtained a rela - tionship between ( S . D . ) 2 and τ , as shown in Fig . 6 .

To maintain the same conditions that were used for the above experiments without phallotoxin , the proportion of TMR - labelled actin was adjusted to 10 % of total . Additionally , G - actin ( Ca ) was added to a final concentration of 140 nM , a criti - cal concentration for polymerization ( see Table 1 ) , to match the background fluores - cence noise of samples without phallotoxin ( see Discussion ) . Here , the filament length was measured between 77 and 107 min after the observation cell was pre - pared . Actin and phalloidin were used at 0 . 15 µ M . © 2002 Nature Publishing Group articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 4 SEPTEMBER 2002 www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 669 obtained the same relationship for the phallotoxin - labelled actin filaments under different levels of background fluorescence noise ( Fig . 6a ) . The line describing the relationship between ( S . D . ) 2 and τ did not pass through the origin , but intersected with the y axis for both kinds of actin ( Ca or Mg ) . Thus , the relationship between ( S . D . ) 2 and τ could be expressed as ( S . D . ) 2 = ( S . D . 0 ) 2 + ατ , where α is a constant . We considered that the constant term , ( S . D . 0 ) 2 , is attributable to a measurement error caused by the spatial resolution , which depends on the contrast of the fluorescence image of actin filaments . It is understandable that the S . D . 0 value of phallotoxin - labelled actin filaments was smaller ( Figs 4b , 6a ) if we consider that the con - trast of the fluorescence image was much higher . To ensure the validity of this explanation , we examined the length fluctuation of phallotoxin - labelled actin filaments at different levels of background fluorescence noise by adding 10 % - labelled ( Fig . 6a , open triangles and squares ) or 50 % - labelled ( Fig . 6a , closed triangles ) G - actin ( Ca ) . We confirmed that the value of S . D . 0 increased as the contrast of filament fluorescence image decreased ( through an increase in the background fluorescence noise ) . Thus , we conclude that the reason why the value of S . D . 0 for actin ( Mg ) ( Fig . 6b ) was larger than that for actin ( Ca ) ( Fig . 6a ) is that the contrast of fluores - cence image of actin ( Mg ) filaments was worse than that of actin ( Ca ) . Discussion Treadmilling of actin filaments was first introduced as a theory by Wegner 7 in 1976 . Since then , the process has been studied exten - sively , although only in solutions containing many actin filaments . Here , we have shown through direct examination that the tread - milling process also occurs at the level of individual actin filaments . We observed that continuous elongation at the barbed end and shortening at the pointed end occurred on individual actin fila - ments during the steady - state phase ( Fig . 2d ) . We also demonstrat - ed that dynamic instability , as observed in microtubules 10 , 11 , does not occur , at least in pure actin filaments . Here , we formulate the theoretical basis for the linear relation - ship between ( S . D . ) 2 and τ obtained by analysis of the length fluc - tuation ( Fig . 6 ) 21 . Assuming that the length fluctuation of actin fil - aments is caused by the stochastic process of association and disso - ciation of actin , the existence probability of actin filaments of length x , at time t , P ( x , t ) , ( 0 ≤ P ( x , t ) ≤ 1 ) , is determined by the fol - lowing differential equation , ( 1 ) where k + and k − are a polymerization and a depolymerization rate constant , respectively , C is the concentration of the polymer - ization unit ( in the simplest case , actin monomers ) coexisting with the filaments , and a is an effective length of polymerization and depolymerization unit ( in the simplest case , a represents an effec - tive length of an actin subunit in the filament , that is , 2 . 7 nm ) . When we distinguish the barbed end and the pointed end , k + = k B + + k P + and k − = k B − + k P − , where k B ( P ) + and k B ( P ) − are the poly - merization and depolymerization rates at the B ( P ) - end , respec - tively . Also , note that the present model does not explicitly take into account the heterogeneous state of actin subunits in the fila - ments coupled with ATP hydrolysis ( see below ) . Equation 1 is reduced to equation 2 ( see below ) , which is the equivalent of a diffusion equation . Here , we expand the P ( x + a ) and P ( x − a ) terms in equation 1 with the Taylor series at x , assuming a < < x and remain the first three terms up to those containing a 2 . ( 2 ) The first term and the second term in the right side of the equation are attributed to diffusion and net polymerization ( flow term ) , respectively . The proportionality coefficient in the first term corresponds to the diffusion coefficient D , which appears in the diffusion equation , as ( 3 ) Note that C in the steady - state phase must be C 0 , that is , the critical concentration for polymerization of actin when the polymerization unit is an actin monomer . The fact that ( S . D . ) 2 was proportional to τ ( Fig . 6 ) demonstrates that the polymerization – depolymerization dynamics at both ends D = 12 a 2 ( k + C + k – ) ∂ P ( x , t ) ∂ t ∂ 2 P ( x , t ) ∂ x 2 ∂ P ( x , t ) ∂ x = 12 ( k + C + k – ) ( k + C – k – ) a 2 – a 2 ∂ P ( x , t ) ∂ t = { k – P ( x + a ) – k + CP ( x ) } + { k + CP ( x – a ) – k – P ( x ) } F r equen cy d 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 a n = 223 S .

D . ) 2 = 2 D τ = a 2 ( k + C 0 + k − ) τ . This is because we have confirmed that the steady - state phase has been attained , so that the flow term in the right side of equation 2 can be neglected ( k + C = k − at C = C 0 ) . Thus , we can estimate the kinetic constants for polymerization and depolymerization during the steady - state phase from the slope of the relationship shown in Fig . 6 . The slight positive slope of the ( S . D . ) 2 versus τ relationship observed in the phallotoxin - labelled filaments ( Fig . 6a ) is attributable to a gradual lowering of the fluo - rescence contrast of the image through photo - bleaching . Thus , the large slope observed in the absence of phallotoxin may include this effect , but it is negligible . To obtain the polymerization and depolymerization rate con - stants during the steady - state phase , the values of C 0 obtained above , 0 . 14 µ M for actin ( Ca ) and 0 . 064 µ M for actin ( Mg ) ( Figs 3d , 5b ) were used . Assuming that the value of a is 2 . 7 nm , the values of k + and k − have been estimated as 1 . 8 × 10 8 M − 1 s − 1 and 25 s − 1 for actin ( Ca ) ( Fig . 6a ) and 4 . 5 × 10 8 M − 1 s − 1 and 29 s − 1 for actin ( Mg ) ( Fig . 6b ) , respectively . Unexpectedly , the values were 30 – 45 times larger than those obtained from the polymerization phase . The results of our analysis are summarized in Table 1 and a possible reason for such a discrepancy is discussed below . 1 min 1 min 1 min 2 min 2 min 3 min a 350 300 250 200 150 100 0 50 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 50 40 30 20 10 0 = 23 min b c 200 150 100 50 0 = 9 min 120 100 0 80 60 40 20 = 24 min 160 120 0 80 40 = 13 min 80 60 0 40 20 70 60 0 50 40 30 10 20 16 0 12 8 4 F r equ en cy F r equen cy F r equen cy = 9 min = 1 min = 5 min = 3 min – 2 – 1 0 1 2 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 = 1 min Length fluctuation ( µ m ) Length fluctuation ( µ m ) Length fluctuation ( µ m ) Figure 4 Frequency of actin ( Ca ) filament length fluctuation in a steady - state phase . a , A schematic illustration of how to measure the frequency of length fluctu - ation .

As shown in Table 1 , the kinetic constants were consistent , except for those estimated from the analysis of the length fluctuation at steady state on the basis of the diffusion process . The latter was approximately 40 times larg - er than the others . Also , note that the critical concentration for actin ( Ca ) obtained in the present study was smaller than that for actin ( Ca ) in which polymerization was induced by calcium 6 . This is probably because in our experiments , calcium attached to actin ( Ca ) monomers can exchange with free magnesium after the addition of salts ( potassium chloride and magnesium chloride ) , so that actin ( Ca ) may have partly been transformed into actin ( Mg ) . There are several possible reasons for the apparent discrepancy between the kinetic constants described above : first , the kinetic constants obtained in the steady - state phase may be intrinsically different from those obtained in the initial phase of polymeriza - tion . As previously reported 9 , the ratio of ADP - type to ATP - type actin at both ends of the filaments is larger in the steady - state phase than in the initial phase of polymerization . It is known that the depolymerization velocity of ADP - actin is an order of magnitude higher than that of ATP - actin , at least at the barbed end 6 . Second , the annealing of actin fragments may be responsible , as for the large polymerization rate that must be balanced by the depolymerization rate in the steady - state phase . As previously reported , the annealing rate constant is comparable to the polymerization rate ( 10 7 M − 1 s − 1 , ref . 22 ; for qualitative data , see ref . 4 ) . This suggests that a poly - merization unit may not be a monomer alone , but an average of monomers , oligomers and fragments . In addition , the size of the depolymerization unit may be different from that of the polymer - ization unit described above . Third , the size of a polymeriza - tion – depolymerization unit , a , may not necessarily indicate a size of a monomer , an oligomer and a fragment of actin , as described above . Rather , it may represent an effective size of a unit involved in cooperative ( consecutive ) polymerization and depolymerization , implying that each cycle of polymerization and depolymerization is F r equen cy F r equen cy F r equen cy d a 7 min 35 min = 7 min 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 80 = 1 min = 13 min 50 40 30 20 10 0 c 60 70 80 90 0 5 10 15 20 25 b 0 1 0 P o l y m e r i z a t i on v e l o c i t y ( µ m m i n – 1 ) F il a m en t l e ng t h ( µ m ) Actin concentration ( µ M ) Time ( min ) Length fluctuation ( µ m ) Length fluctuation ( µ m ) Length fluctuation ( µ m ) 0 . 8 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 – 2 0 – 1 1 2 – 2 0 – 1 1 2 – 2 0 – 1 1 2 Figure 5 Analysis of the polymerization dynamics of actin ( Mg ) . a , Fluorescence micrographs show polymerized filaments 7 min and 35 min after the addition of salts .

In fact , the treadmilling ( cooperative ) process occurs through the coupling of polymerization with ATP hydrolysis on actin , which may be equiv - alent to dynamic instability for actin . Whatever the mechanism , one plausible way to account for the large ( 40 × ) rate constants is through a difference in the effective size of a . If a is approximately six times larger than that of actin monomers , using equation 3 , a 2 becomes 36 times larger , which is a close approximation of the 40 × values . To clarify the polymerization – depolymerization dynamics at each end of the filaments , we need more detailed analysis of length change , with higher spatio - temporal resolution after distin - guishing the barbed end and the pointed end . Significantly , the usual methods used to monitor the average process of polymerization and depolymerization may miss the annealing process discussed above . For example , the fluorescence intensity of pyrene is very sensitive to the polymerization and depolymerization of monomers , but insensitive to the annealing of fragments . This may explain why , on the basis of analysis of incor - poration of pyrene - labelled actin into the filaments in the steady - state phase , Brenner and Korn 23 obtained the kinetic constants con - sistent with those obtained from the polymerization phase , but did not find a discrepancy similar to that found in this study . Thus , the single - filament analysis of actin polymerization has not only demonstrated the treadmilling process on single actin filaments , but has also identified a new aspect of polymeriza - tion – depolymerization dynamics by making it possible to analyse fluctuations in length at steady state . The present results indicate that the polymerization – depolymerization dynamics of pure actin filaments are not as ‘dynamic’ as those of microtubules . However , because actin is a central component of the cytoskele - ton , a wide variety of actin - specific dynamic processes exist . It will be important to investigate the effects of various actin - bind - ing proteins on the polymerization phase and the length fluctua - tions of actin filaments at steady state . We infer that the dynamic properties of polymerization and depolymerization of pure fila - ments may allow actin to perform different dynamic functions in different cell types , through interactions with cell - specific regula - tory proteins . Methods Preparation of actin G - actin ( Ca ) was prepared from rabbit muscle according to Spudich and Watt 24 , except that the tropomyosin – troponin complex was removed before preparing acetone powder , as previously desctibed 4 . G - actin ( Ca ) was solubilized in2mM Tris - HCl at pH8 . 0 , 0 . 1mM calcium chloride , 0 . 1 mM ATP ( Boehringer Ingelheim , Ingelheim , Germany ) and 2mM sodium azide . The concentra - tion of actin was determined from ultraviolet absorption ( UV 2000 , Shimadzu , Japan ) with A 1 % 290 = 6 . 3 cm − 1 . Labelling of actin with fluorescent dye was performed by incubating 1 . 7mgml − 1 F - actin in a solu - tion containing 0 . 1M potassium chloride , 0 . 2mM magnesium chloride , 0 . 1mM ATP , 10mM MOPS at pH7 . 0 and 100 µ M tetramethylrhodamine - 5 - maleimide ( TMR - 5 - MA ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) dissolved in dimethylformamide ( DMF ; Sigma , St Louis , MO ) for 2h at room temperature . TMR - 5 - MA ( 20mM ) dissolved in DMF was slowly added to the F - actin solution with continuous stir - ring . TMR - labelled F - actin was centrifuged at 411 , 000 g for 45min at 8 ° C . The pellet was then dis - solved in and dialysed against 20mM PIPES at pH6 . 8 , 0 . 1mM ATP and 0 . 1mM calcium chloride overnight at 2 ° C . After centrifugation at 411 , 000 g for 20min at 2 ° C , the fluorescent dye was removed from the G - actin solution by Sephadex G - 25 column chromatograpy . The concentration of TMR was estimated from the molar extinction coefficient at 550 nm , 96 , 900M − 1 cm − 1 ( Molecular Probes ) . The concentration of labelled G - actin ( Ca ) was determined by subtracting 0 . 208 × A 550 from the A 290 value . The molar ratio of the label to actin was estimated to be > 96 % . TMR - labelled G - actin ( Mg ) was pre - pared by incubating labelled G - actin ( Ca ) in 0 . 2mM EGTA ( Dojindo , Kumamoto , Japan ) , 0 . 1mM ATP , 20mM PIPES at pH6 . 8 and 0 . 1mM magnesium chloride for 60min at 0 ° C 25 before centrifuga - tion at 350 , 000 g for 1h at 2 ° C . The supernatant was used as labelled G - actin ( Mg ) . Pyrenyl – actin was prepared as previously described 26 . Experimental conditions For microscopic examination , the in vitro polymerization of actin was initiated by addition of poly - merization buffer ( final concentrations : 30mM potassium chloride , 2mM magnesium chloride , 4 mM ATP , 20mM MOPS at pH7 . 0 , 10mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) and 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) methylcellulose ) at 27 ° C . This solution was then immediately transferred to a glass coverslip before microscopic exami - nation . The proportion of TMR - labelled actin was maintained at 10 % . It has been confirmed that at this labelling ratio , the polymerization rate and critical concentration in solution are unchanged 18 . For examination in solution , polymerization of actin ( Ca or Mg ) containing 10 % pyrenyl – actin was initiated in a cuvette by adding the polymerization buffer , with or without methylcellulose . Fluorescence intensity was measured at 27 ° C in a fluorescence spectrophotometer ( F - 4500 , Hitachi , Tokyo , Japan ) . We confirmed that methylcellulose does not affect the average polymerization proper - ties of actin in solution ( Table1 ) . When the effect of phallotoxin was examined , the phallotoxin ( phalloidin or phallacidin ; Sigma ) was added after the polymerization of actin ( Ca ) ( 10 % TMR - labelled ) was complete . The length of phallotoxin - labelled actin filaments was measured after a 1 : 10 dilution of the solution against the polymerization buffer containing 0 . 14 µ M G - actin ( Ca ) ( the criti - cal concentration for polymerization ) , of which either 10 % or 50 % was labelled with TMR as back - ground fluorescence noise . Here , we examined not only phalloidin , but also phallacidin , because the stabilizing properties of phallacidin for actin filaments seemed to be stronger than those of phalloidin ( see ref . 16 ) . Optical system Fluorescently labelled single actin filaments were visualized by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy 27 ( IX70 , Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) , which illuminates to a depth of only ∼ 150nm below the coverslip . Samples were illuminated with a green laser ( µ - Green model 4301 - 050 ; Uniphase , San Jose , CA ) . After 100 video frames ( duration 3s ) were superimposed by using a digital image processing sys - tem ( DIPS , Hamamatsu Photonics , Hamamatsu , Japan ) , the length of actin filaments was measured . The distance between adjacent pixels was 0 . 128 µ m , to which the spatial resolution was limited . 0 10 20 30 0 . 8 1 0 . 05 Time ( min ) 0 a 0 10 20 30 40 1 2 Time ( min ) 0 b 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 ( S .

After actin filaments were stabilized with phalloidin , 0 . 14 µ M G - actin ( Ca ) , of which 10 % ( open triangles ) or 50 % ( closed triangles ) was TMR - labelled , was added to produce a fluorescence background noise . Open squares represent 0 . 15 µ M phallacidin – actin ( Ca ) , where ( S . D . ) 2 = 0 . 00041 τ + 0 . 015 .
