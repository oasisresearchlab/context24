Statistical mechanics of complex networks Re´ka Albert * and Albert - La´szlo´ Baraba´si DepartmentofPhysics , UniversityofNotreDame , NotreDame , Indiana46556 ( Published 30 January 2002 ) Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society . Frequently cited examples include the cell , a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions , and the Internet , a network of routers and computers connected by physical links . While traditionally these systems have been modeled as random graphs , it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks are governed by robust organizing principles . This article reviews the recent advances in the ﬁeld of complex networks , focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics . After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks , the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools , covering random graphs , small - world and scale - free networks , the emerging theory of evolving networks , and the interplay between topology and the network’s robustness against failures and attacks .

For example , the cell is best described as a com - plex network of chemicals connected by chemical reac - tions ; the Internet is a complex network of routers and computers linked by various physical or wireless links ; fads and ideas spread on the social network , whose nodes are human beings and whose edges represent various social relationships ; the World Wide Web is an enormous virtual network of Web pages connected by hyperlinks . These systems represent just a few of the many examples that have recently prompted the scien - tiﬁc community to investigate the mechanisms that de - termine the topology of complex networks . The desire to understand such interwoven systems has encountered signiﬁcant challenges as well . Physics , a major beneﬁ - ciary of reductionism , has developed an arsenal of suc - cessful tools for predicting the behavior of a system as a whole from the properties of its constituents . We now understand how magnetism emerges from the collective behavior of millions of spins , or how quantum particles lead to such spectacular phenomena as Bose - Einstein condensation or superﬂuidity . The success of these mod - eling efforts is based on the simplicity of the interactions between the elements : there is no ambiguity as to what interacts with what , and the interaction strength is uniquely determined by the physical distance . We are at a loss , however , to describe systems for which physical distance is irrelevant or for which there is ambiguity as to whether two components interact . While for many complex systems with nontrivial network topology such ambiguity is naturally present , in the past few years we have increasingly recognized that the tools of statistical mechanics offer an ideal framework for describing these interwoven systems as well . These developments have introduced new and challenging problems for statistical physics and unexpected links to major topics in condensed - matter physics , ranging from percolation to Bose - Einstein condensation . Traditionally the study of complex networks has been the territory of graph theory . While graph theory ini - tially focused on regular graphs , since the 1950s large - scale networks with no apparent design principles have been described as random graphs , proposed as the sim - plest and most straightforward realization of a complex network . Random graphs were ﬁrst studied by the Hun - garian mathematicians Paul Erdo˝s and Alfre´d Re´nyi . According to the Erdo˝s - Re´nyi model , we start with N nodes and connect every pair of nodes with probability p , creating a graph with approximately pN ( N 2 1 ) / 2 edges distributed randomly . This model has guided our thinking about complex networks for decades since its introduction . But the growing interest in complex sys - tems has prompted many scientists to reconsider this modeling paradigm and ask a simple question : are the real networks behind such diverse complex systems as the cell or the Internet fundamentally random ? Our in - tuition clearly indicates that complex systems must dis - play some organizing principles , which should be at some level encoded in their topology . But if the topology of these networks indeed deviates from a random graph , we need to develop tools and measurements to capture in quantitative terms the underlying organizing prin - ciples . In the past few years we have witnessed dramatic ad - vances in this direction , prompted by several parallel de - velopments . First , the computerization of data acquisi - tion in all ﬁelds led to the emergence of large databases on the topology of various real networks . Second , the increased computing power allowed us to investigate networks containing millions of nodes , exploring ques - tions that could not be addressed before . Third , the slow but noticeable breakdown of boundaries between disci - plines offered researchers access to diverse databases , allowing them to uncover the generic properties of com - plex networks . Finally , there is an increasingly voiced need to move beyond reductionist approaches and try to understand the behavior of the system as a whole . Along this route , understanding the topology of the interac - tions between the components , i . e . , networks , is un - avoidable . Motivated by these converging developments and cir - cumstances , many new concepts and measures have been proposed and investigated in depth in the past few years . However , three concepts occupy a prominent place in contemporary thinking about complex net - works . Here we deﬁne and brieﬂy discuss them , a discus - sion to be expanded in the coming sections . Small worlds : The small - world concept in simple terms describes the fact that despite their often large size , in most networks there is a relatively short path between any two nodes . The distance between two nodes is deﬁned as the number of edges along the short - est path connecting them . The most popular manifesta - tion of small worlds is the ‘‘six degrees of separation’’ concept , uncovered by the social psychologist Stanley Milgram ( 1967 ) , who concluded that there was a path of 48 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 acquaintances with a typical length of about six between most pairs of people in the United States ( Kochen , 1989 ) . The small - world property appears to characterize most complex networks : the actors in Hollywood are on average within three co - stars from each other , or the chemicals in a cell are typically separated by three reac - tions . The small - world concept , while intriguing , is not an indication of a particular organizing principle . In - deed , as Erdo˝s and Re´nyi have demonstrated , the typi - cal distance between any two nodes in a random graph scales as the logarithm of the number of nodes . Thus random graphs are small worlds as well . Clustering : A common property of social networks is that cliques form , representing circles of friends or ac - quaintances in which every member knows every other member . This inherent tendency to cluster is quantiﬁed by the clustering coefﬁcient ( Watts and Strogatz , 1998 ) , a concept that has its roots in sociology , appearing under the name ‘‘fraction of transitive triples’’ ( Wassermann and Faust , 1994 ) . Let us focus ﬁrst on a selected node i in the network , having k i edges which connect it to k i other nodes . If the nearest neighbors of the original node were part of a clique , there would be k i ( k i 2 1 ) / 2 edges between them . The ratio between the number E i of edges that actually exist between these k i nodes and the total number k i ( k i 2 1 ) / 2 gives the value of the clus - tering coefﬁcient of node i , C i 5 2 E i k i ~ k i 2 1 ! . ( 1 ) The clustering coefﬁcient of the whole network is the average of all individual C i ’s . An alternative deﬁnition of C that is often used in the literature is discussed in Sec . VI . B . 2 ( Barrat and Weigt , 2000 ; Newman , Strogatz , and Watts , 2000 ) . In a random graph , since the edges are distributed randomly , the clustering coefﬁcient is C 5 p ( Sec . III . F ) . However , in most , if not all , real networks the clustering coefﬁcient is typically much larger than it is in a compa - rable random network ( i . e . , having the same number of nodes and edges as the real network ) . Degree distribution : Not all nodes in a network have the same number of edges ( same node degree ) . The spread in the node degrees is characterized by a distri - bution function P ( k ) , which gives the probability that a randomly selected node has exactly k edges . Since in a random graph the edges are placed randomly , the major - ity of nodes have approximately the same degree , close to the average degree ^ k & of the network . The degree distribution of a random graph is a Poisson distribution with a peak at P ( ^ k & ) . One of the most interesting de - velopments in our understanding of complex networks was the discovery that for most large networks the de - gree distribution signiﬁcantly deviates from a Poisson distribution . In particular , for a large number of net - works , including the World Wide Web ( Albert , Jeong , and Baraba´si , 1999 ) , the Internet ( Faloutsos et al . , 1999 ) , or metabolic networks ( Jeong et al . , 2000 ) , the degree distribution has a power - law tail , P ~ k ! ; k 2 g . ( 2 ) Such networks are called scale free ( Baraba´si and Al - bert , 1999 ) . While some networks display an exponential tail , often the functional form of P ( k ) still deviates sig - niﬁcantly from the Poisson distribution expected for a random graph . These discoveries have initiated a revival of network modeling in the past few years , resulting in the introduc - tion and study of three main classes of modeling para - digms . First , random graphs , which are variants of the Erdo˝s - Re´nyi model , are still widely used in many ﬁelds and serve as a benchmark for many modeling and em - pirical studies . Second , motivated by clustering , a class of models , collectively called small - world models , has been proposed . These models interpolate between the highly clustered regular lattices and random graphs . Fi - nally , the discovery of the power - law degree distribution has led to the construction of various scale - free models that , by focusing on the network dynamics , aim to offer a universal theory of network evolution . The purpose of this article is to review each of these modeling efforts , focusing on the statistical mechanics of complex networks . Our main goal is to present the the - oretical developments in parallel with the empirical data that initiated and support the various models and theo - retical tools . To achieve this , we start with a brief de - scription of the real networks and databases that repre - sent the testing ground for most current modeling efforts . II . THE TOPOLOGY OF REAL NETWORKS : EMPIRICAL RESULTS The study of most complex networks has been initi - ated by a desire to understand various real systems , ranging from communication networks to ecological webs . Thus the databases available for study span sev - eral disciplines . In this section we review brieﬂy those that have been studied by researchers aiming to uncover the general features of complex networks . Beyond a de - scription of the databases , we shall focus on three robust measures of a network’s topology : average path length , clustering coefﬁcient , and degree distribution . Other quantities , as discussed in the following sections , will again be tested on these databases . The properties of the investigated databases , as well as the obtained expo - nents , are summarized in Tables I and II . A . World Wide Web The World Wide Web represents the largest network for which topological information is currently available . The nodes of the network are the documents ( web pages ) and the edges are the hyperlinks ( URL’s ) that point from one document to another ( see Fig . 1 ) . The size of this network was close to one billion nodes at the end of 1999 ( Lawrence and Giles , 1998 , 1999 ) . The in - terest in the World Wide Web as a network boomed after it was discovered that the degree distribution of the web pages follows a power law over several orders of magnitude ( Albert , Jeong , and Baraba ´ si , 1999 ; Kumar 49 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 et al . , 1999 ) . Since the edges of the World Wide Web are directed , the network is characterized by two degree dis - tributions : the distribution of outgoing edges , P out ( k ) , signiﬁes the probability that a document has k outgoing hyperlinks , and the distribution of incoming edges , P in ( k ) , is the probability that k hyperlinks point to a certain document . Several studies have established that both P out ( k ) and P in ( k ) have power - law tails : P out ~ k ! ; k 2 g out and P in ~ k ! ; k 2 g in . ( 3 ) Albert , Jeong , and Baraba´si ( 1999 ) have studied a subset of the World Wide Web containing 325 729 nodes and have found g out 5 2 . 45 and g in 5 2 . 1 . Kumar et al . ( 1999 ) used a 40 - million - document crawl by Alexa Inc . , obtaining g out 5 2 . 38 and g in 5 2 . 1 ( see also Kleinberg et al . , 1999 ) . A later survey of the World Wide Web to - pology by Broder et al . ( 2000 ) used two 1999 Altavista crawls containing in total 200 million documents , obtain - ing g out 5 2 . 72 and g in 5 2 . 1 with scaling holding close to ﬁve orders of magnitude ( Fig . 2 ) . Adamic and Huber - man ( 2000 ) used a somewhat different representation of the World Wide Web , with each node representing a separate domain name and two nodes being connected if any of the pages in one domain linked to any page in the other . While this method lumped together pages that were on the same domain , representing a nontrivial ag - gregation of the nodes , the distribution of incoming edges still followed a power law with g indom 5 1 . 94 . Note that g in is the same for all measurements at the document level despite the two - years’ time delay be - tween the ﬁrst and last web crawl , during which the World Wide Web had grown at least ﬁve times larger . However , g out has a tendency to increase with the sample size or time ( see Table II ) . Despite the large number of nodes , the World Wide Web displays the small - world property . This was ﬁrst re - ported by Albert , Jeong , and Baraba´si ( 1999 ) , who found that the average path length for a sample of 325 729 nodes was 11 . 2 and predicted , using ﬁnite size scaling , that for the full World Wide Web of 800 million nodes that would be a path length of around 19 . Subse - quent measurements by Broder et al . ( 2000 ) found that the average path length between nodes in a 50 - million - node sample of the World Wide Web is 16 , in agreement with the ﬁnite size prediction for a sample of this size . Finally , the domain - level network displays an average path length of 3 . 1 ( Adamic , 1999 ) . The directed nature of the World Wide Web does not allow us to measure the clustering coefﬁcient using Eq . ( 1 ) . One way to avoid this difﬁculty is to make the net - work undirected , making each edge bidirectional . This was the path followed by Adamic ( 1999 ) , who studied the World Wide Web at the domain level using a 1997 Alexa crawl of 50 million web pages distributed among 259 794 sites . Adamic removed the nodes that had have only one edge , focusing on a network of 153 127 sites . While these modiﬁcations are expected to increase the clustering coefﬁcient somewhat , she found C 5 0 . 1078 , orders of magnitude higher than C rand 5 0 . 000 23 corre - sponding to a random graph of the same size and aver - age degree . B . Internet The Internet is a network of physical links between computers and other telecommunication devices ( Fig . TABLE I . The general characteristics of several real networks . For each network we have indicated the number of nodes , the average degree ^ k & , the average path length l , and the clustering coefﬁcient C . For a comparison we have included the average path length l rand and clustering coefﬁcient C rand of a random graph of the same size and average degree .

Faloutsos et al . ( 1999 ) have studied the Internet at both levels , concluding that in each case the degree distribution follows a power law . The inter - domain topology of the Internet , captured at three dif - ferent dates between 1997 and the end of 1998 , resulted in degree exponents between g Ias 5 2 . 15 and g Ias 5 2 . 2 . The 1995 survey of Internet topology at the router level , containing 3888 nodes , found g Ir 5 2 . 48 ( Faloutsos et al . , 1999 ) . Recently Govindan and Tangmunarunkit ( 2000 ) mapped the connectivity of nearly 150 000 router inter - faces and nearly 200 000 router adjacencies , conﬁrming the power - law scaling with g Ir . 2 . 3 [ see Fig . 3 ( a ) ] . The Internet as a network does display clustering and small path length as well . Yook et al . ( 2001a ) and Pastor - Satorras et al . ( 2001 ) , studying the Internet at the do - main level between 1997 and 1999 , found that its clus - tering coefﬁcient ranged between 0 . 18 and 0 . 3 , to be compared with C rand . 0 . 001 for random networks with similar parameters . The average path length of the In - ternet at the domain level ranged between 3 . 70 and 3 . 77 ( Pastor - Satorras et al . , 2001 ; Yook et al . 2001a ) and at the router level it was around 9 ( Yook et al . , 2001a ) , indicating its small - world character .

Movie actor collaboration network A much - studied database is the movie actor collabo - ration network , based on the Internet Movie Database , which contains all movies and their casts since the 1890s . In this network the nodes are the actors , and two nodes have a common edge if the corresponding actors have acted in a movie together . This is a continuously expand - ing network , with 225 226 nodes in 1998 ( Watts and Stro - gatz , 1998 ) , which grew to 449 913 nodes by May 2000 ( Newman , Strogatz , and Watts , 2000 ) . The average path length of the actor network is close to that of a random graph with the same size and average degree , 3 . 65 com - pared with 2 . 9 , but its clustering coefﬁcient is more than 100 times higher than a random graph ( Watts and Stro - gatz , 1998 ) . The degree distribution of the movie actor network has a power - law tail for large k [ see Fig . 3 ( b ) ] , following P ( k ) ; k 2 g actor , where g actor 5 2 . 3 6 0 . 1 ( Bara - ba´si and Albert , 1999 ; Albert and Baraba´si , 2000 ; Ama - ral et al . , 2000 ) . D . Science collaboration graph A collaboration network similar to that of the movie actors can be constructed for scientists , where the nodes are the scientists and two nodes are connected if the two scientists have written an article together . To uncover the topology of this complex graph , Newman ( 2001a , 2001b , 2001c ) studied four databases spanning physics , biomedical research , high - energy physics , and computer science over a ﬁve - year window ( 1995 – 1999 ) . All these networks show a small average path length but a high clustering coefﬁcient , as summarized in Table I . The de - gree distribution of the collaboration network of high - energy physicists is an almost perfect power law with an exponent of 1 . 2 [ Fig . 3 ( c ) ] , while the other databases display power laws with a larger exponent in the tail . Baraba´si et al . ( 2001 ) investigated the collaboration graph of mathematicians and neuroscientists publishing between 1991 and 1998 . The average path length of these networks is around l math 5 9 . 5 and l nsci 5 6 , their clustering coefﬁcient being C math 5 0 . 59 and C nsci 5 0 . 76 . The degree distributions of these collaboration networks are consistent with power laws with degree ex - ponents 2 . 1 and 2 . 5 , respectively [ see Fig . 3 ( d ) ] . E . The web of human sexual contacts Many sexually transmitted diseases , including AIDS , spread on a network of sexual relationships . Liljeros et al . ( 2001 ) have studied the web constructed from the sexual relations of 2810 individuals , based on an exten - sive survey conducted in Sweden in 1996 . Since the edges in this network are relatively short lived , they ana - lyzed the distribution of partners over a single year , ob - taining for both females and males a power - law degree distribution with an exponent g f 5 3 . 5 6 0 . 2 and g m 5 3 . 3 6 0 . 2 , respectively . F . Cellular networks Jeong et al . ( 2000 ) studied the metabolism of 43 or - ganisms representing all three domains of life , recon - structing them in networks in which the nodes are the FIG . 3 .

Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 substrates ( such as ATP , ADP , H 2 O ) and the edges rep - resent the predominantly directed chemical reactions in which these substrates can participate . The distributions of the outgoing and incoming edges have been found to follow power laws for all organisms , with the degree ex - ponents varying between 2 . 0 and 2 . 4 . While due to the network’s directedness the clustering coefﬁcient has not been determined , the average path length was found to be approximately the same in all organisms , with a value of 3 . 3 . The clustering coefﬁcient was studied by Wagner and Fell ( 2000 ; see also Fell and Wagner , 2000 ) , focusing on the energy and biosynthesis metabolism of the Escheri - chia coli bacterium . They found that , in addition to the power law degree distribution , the undirected version of this substrate graph has a small average path length and a large clustering coefﬁcient ( see Table I ) . Another important network characterizing the cell de - scribes protein - protein interactions , where the nodes are proteins and they are connected if it has been experi - mentally demonstrated that they bind together . A study of these physical interactions shows that the degree dis - tribution of the physical protein interaction map for yeast follows a power law with an exponential cutoff P ( k ) ; ( k 1 k 0 ) 2 g e 2 ( k 1 k 0 ) / k c with k 0 5 1 , k c 5 20 , and g 5 2 . 4 ( Jeong , Mason , et al . , 2001 ) . G . Ecological networks Food webs are used regularly by ecologists to quantify the interaction between various species ( Pimm , 1991 ) . In a food web the nodes are species and the edges repre - sent predator - prey relationships between them . In a re - cent study , Williams et al . ( 2000 ) investigated the topol - ogy of the seven most documented and largest food webs , namely , those of Skipwith Pond , Little Rock Lake , Bridge Brook Lake , Chesapeake Bay , Ythan Estuary , Coachella Valley , and St . Martin Island . While these webs differ widely in the number of species or their av - erage degree , they all indicate that species in habitats are three or fewer edges from each other . This result was supported by the independent investigations of Montoya and Sole´ ( 2000 ) and Camacho et al . ( 2001a ) , who showed that food webs are highly clustered as well . The degree distribution was ﬁrst addressed by Montoya and Sole´ ( 2000 ) , focusing on the food webs of Ythan Estuary , Silwood Park , and Little Rock Lake , considering these networks as being nondirected . Although the size of these webs is small ( the largest of them has 186 nodes ) , they appear to share the nonrandom properties of their larger counterparts . In particular , Montoya and Sole´ ( 2000 ) concluded that the degree distribution is consis - tent with a power law with an unusually small exponent of g . 1 . 1 . The small size of these webs does leave room , however , for some ambiguity in P ( k ) . Camacho et al . ( 2001a , 2001b ) ﬁnd that for some food webs an exponen - tial ﬁt works equally well . While the well - documented existence of key species that play an important role in food web topology points towards the existence of hubs ( a common feature of scale - free networks ) , an unam - biguous determination of the network’s topology could beneﬁt from larger datasets . Due to the inherent difﬁ - culty in the data collection process ( Williams et al . , 2000 ) , this is not expected anytime soon . H . Phone call network A large directed graph has been constructed from long - distance telephone call patterns , where nodes are phone numbers and every completed phone call is an edge , directed from the caller to the receiver . Abello , Pardalos , and Resende ( 1999 ) and Aiello , Chung , and Lu ( 2000 ) studied the call graph of long - distance tele - phone calls made during a single day , ﬁnding that the degree distributions of the outgoing and incoming edges followed a power law with exponent g out 5 g in 5 2 . 1 . I . Citation networks A rather complex network is formed by the citation patterns of scientiﬁc publications , the nodes standing for published articles and a directed edge representing a ref - erence to a previously published article . Redner ( 1998 ) , studying the citation distribution of 783 339 papers cata - loged by the Institute for Scientiﬁc Information and 24 296 papers published in Physical Review D between 1975 and 1994 , has found that the probability that a pa - per is cited k times follows a power law with exponent g cite 5 3 , indicating that the incoming degree distribution of the citation network follows a power law . A recent study by Va´zquez ( 2001 ) extended these studies to the outgoing degree distribution as well , ﬁnding that it has an exponential tail . J . Networks in linguistics The complexity of human languages offers several possibilities for deﬁning and studying complex networks . Recently Ferrer i Cancho and Sole´ ( 2001 ) have con - structed such a network for the English language , based on the British National Corpus , with words as nodes ; these nodes are linked if they appear next to or one word apart from each other in sentences . They have found that the resulting network of 440 902 words dis - plays a small average path length l 5 2 . 67 , a high clus - tering coefﬁcient C 5 0 . 437 , and a two - regime power - law degree distribution . Words with degree k < 10 3 decay with a degree exponent g , 5 1 . 5 , while words with 10 3 , k , 10 5 follow a power law with g . . 2 . 7 . A different study ( Yook , Jeong , and Baraba´si , 2001b ) linked words based on their meanings , i . e . , two words were connected to each other if they were known to be synonyms according to the Merriam - Webster Dictio - nary . The results indicate the existence of a giant cluster of 22 311 words from the total of 23 279 words that have synonyms , with an average path length l 5 4 . 5 , and a rather high clustering coefﬁcient C 5 0 . 7 compared to C rand 5 0 . 0006 for an equivalent random network . In ad - dition , the degree distribution followed had a power - law 53 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 tail with g syn 5 2 . 8 . These results indicate that in many respects language also forms a complex network with organizing principles not so different from the examples discussed earlier ( see also Steyvers and Tenenbaum , 2001 ) . K . Power and neural networks The power grid of the western United States is de - scribed by a complex network whose nodes are genera - tors , transformers , and substations , and the edges are high - voltage transmission lines . The number of nodes in the power grid is N 5 4941 , and ^ k & 5 2 . 67 . In the tiny ( N 5 282 ) neural network of the nematode worm C . el - egans , the nodes are the neurons , and an edge joins two neurons if they are connected by either a synapse or a gap junction . Watts and Strogatz ( 1998 ) found that , while for both networks the average path length was approximately equal to that of a random graph of the same size and average degree , their clustering coefﬁcient was much higher ( Table I ) . The degree distribution of the power grid is consistent with an exponential , while for the C . elegans neural network it has a peak at an intermediate k after which it decays following an expo - nential ( Amaral et al . , 2000 ) . L . Protein folding During folding a protein takes up consecutive confor - mations . Representing with a node each distinct state , two conformations are linked if they can be obtained from each other by an elementary move . Scala , Amaral , and Barthe´le´my ( 2001 ) studied the network formed by the conformations of a two - dimensional ( 2D ) lattice polymer , ﬁnding that it has small - world properties . Spe - ciﬁcally , the average path length increases logarithmi - cally when the size of the polymer ( and consequently the size of the network ) increases , similarly to the behavior seen in a random graph . The clustering coefﬁcient , how - ever , is much larger than C rand , a difference that in - creases with the network size . The degree distribution of this conformation network is consistent with a Gaussian ( Amaral et al . , 2000 ) . The databases discussed above served as motivation and a source of inspiration for uncovering the topologi - cal properties of real networks . We shall refer to them frequently to validate various theoretical predictions or to understand the limitations of the modeling efforts . In the remainder of this review we discuss the various the - oretical tools developed to model these complex net - works . In this respect , we need to start with the mother of all network models : the random - graph theory of Erdo˝s and Re´nyi . III . RANDOM - GRAPH THEORY In mathematical terms a network is represented by a graph . A graph is a pair of sets G 5 $ P , E % , where P is a set of N nodes ( or vertices or points ) P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P N and E is a set of edges ( or links or lines ) that connect two elements of P . Graphs are usually represented as a set of dots , each corresponding to a node , two of these dots being joined by a line if the corresponding nodes are connected ( see Fig . 4 ) . Graph theory has its origins in the eighteenth century in the work of Leonhard Euler , the early work concen - trating on small graphs with a high degree of regularity . In the twentieth century graph theory has become more statistical and algorithmic . A particularly rich source of ideas has been the study of random graphs , graphs in which the edges are distributed randomly . Networks with a complex topology and unknown organizing prin - ciples often appear random ; thus random - graph theory is regularly used in the study of complex networks . The theory of random graphs was introduced by Paul Erdo˝s and Alfre´d Re´nyi ( 1959 , 1960 , 1961 ) after Erdo˝s discovered that probabilistic methods were often useful in tackling problems in graph theory . A detailed review of the ﬁeld is available in the classic book of Bolloba´s ( 1985 ) , complemented by Cohen’s ( 1988 ) review of the parallels between phase transitions and random - graph theory , and by Karon´ski and Ruc´inski’s ( 1997 ) guide to the history of the Erdo˝s - Re´nyi approach . Here we brieﬂy describe the most important results of random - graph theory , focusing on the aspects that are of direct relevance to complex networks . A . The Erdo˝s - Re´nyi model In their classic ﬁrst article on random graphs , Erdo˝s and Re´nyi deﬁne a random graph as N labeled nodes connected by n edges , which are chosen randomly from the N ( N 2 1 ) / 2 possible edges ( Erdo˝s and Re´nyi , 1959 ) . In total there are C @ N ( N 2 1 ) / 2 # n graphs with N nodes and n edges , forming a probability space in which every real - ization is equiprobable . An alternative and equivalent deﬁnition of a random graph is the binomial model . Here we start with N nodes , every pair of nodes being connected with prob - ability p ( see Fig . 5 ) . Consequently the total number of edges is a random variable with the expectation value E ( n ) 5 p @ N ( N 2 1 ) / 2 # . If G 0 is a graph with nodes P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P N and n edges , the probability of obtaining it by this graph construction process is P ( G 0 ) 5 p n ( 1 2 p ) N ( N 2 1 ) / 2 2 n . FIG . 4 . Illustration of a graph with N 5 5 nodes and n 5 4 edges . The set of nodes is P 5 $ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 % and the edge set is E 5 $ $ 1 , 2 % , $ 1 , 5 % , $ 2 , 3 % , $ 2 , 5 % % . 54 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 Random - graph theory studies the properties of the probability space associated with graphs with N nodes as N ! ‘ . Many properties of such random graphs can be determined using probabilistic arguments . In this respect Erdo˝s and Re´nyi used the deﬁnition that almost every graph has a property Q if the probability of having Q approaches 1 as N ! ‘ . Among the questions addressed by Erdo˝s and Re´nyi , some have direct relevance to an understanding of complex networks as well , such as : Is a typical graph connected ? Does it contain a triangle of connected nodes ? How does its diameter depend on its size ? In the mathematical literature the construction of a random graph is often called an evolution : starting with a set of N isolated vertices , the graph develops by the successive addition of random edges . The graphs ob - tained at different stages of this process correspond to larger and larger connection probabilities p , eventually obtaining a fully connected graph [ having the maximum number of edges n 5 N ( N 2 1 ) / 2 ] for p ! 1 . The main goal of random - graph theory is to determine at what connection probability p a particular property of a graph will most likely arise . The greatest discovery of Erdo˝s and Re´nyi was that many important properties of ran - dom graphs appear quite suddenly . That is , at a given probability either almost every graph has some property Q ( e . g . , every pair of nodes is connected by a path of consecutive edges ) or , conversely , almost no graph has it . The transition from a property’s being very unlikely to its being very likely is usually swift . For many such prop - erties there is a critical probability p c ( N ) . If p ( N ) grows more slowly than p c ( N ) as N ! ‘ , then almost every graph with connection probability p ( N ) fails to have Q . If p ( N ) grows somewhat faster than p c ( N ) , then almost every graph has the property Q . Thus the probability that a graph with N nodes and connection probability p 5 p ( N ) has property Q satisﬁes lim N ! ‘ P N , p ~ Q ! 5 H 0 if p ~ N ! p c ~ N ! ! 0 1 if p ~ N ! p c ~ N ! ! ‘ . ( 4 ) An important note is in order here . Physicists trained in critical phenomena will recognize in p c ( N ) the critical probability familiar in percolation . In the physics litera - ture the system is usually viewed at a ﬁxed system size N and then the different regimes in Eq . ( 4 ) reduce to the question of whether p is smaller or larger than p c . The proper value of p c , that is , the limit p c 5 p c ( N ! ‘ ) , is obtained by ﬁnite size scaling . The basis of this proce - dure is the assumption that this limit exists , reﬂecting the fact that ultimately the percolation threshold is inde - pendent of the system size . This is usually the case in ﬁnite - dimensional systems , which include most physical systems of interest for percolation theory and critical phenomena . In contrast , networks are by deﬁnition inﬁ - nite dimensional : the number of neighbors a node can have increases with the system size . Consequently in random - graph theory the occupation probability is de - ﬁned as a function of the system size : p represents the fraction of the edges that are present from the possible N ( N 2 1 ) / 2 . Larger graphs with the same p will contain more edges , and consequently properties like the ap - pearance of cycles could occur for smaller p in large graphs than in smaller ones . This means that for many properties Q in random graphs there is no unique , N - independent threshold , but we have to deﬁne a threshold function that depends on the system size , and p c ( N ! ‘ ) ! 0 . However , we shall see that the average degree of the graph ^ k & 5 2 n / N 5 p ~ N 2 1 ! . pN ( 5 ) does have a critical value that is independent of the sys - tem size . In the coming subsection we illustrate these ideas by looking at the emergence of various subgraphs in random graphs . B . Subgraphs The ﬁrst property of random graphs to be studied by Erdo˝s and Re´nyi ( 1959 ) was the appearance of sub - graphs . A graph G 1 consisting of a set P 1 of nodes and a set E 1 of edges is a subgraph of a graph G 5 $ P , E % if all nodes in P 1 are also nodes of P and all edges in E 1 are also edges of E . The simplest examples of subgraphs are cycles , trees , and complete subgraphs ( see Fig . 5 ) . A cycle of order k is a closed loop of k edges such that every two consecutive edges and only those have a com - mon node . That is , graphically a triangle is a cycle of order 3 , while a rectangle is a cycle of order 4 . The av - erage degree of a cycle is equal to 2 , since every node has two edges . The opposite of cycles are the trees , which cannot form closed loops . More precisely , a graph is a tree of order k if it has k nodes and k 2 1 edges , FIG . 5 . Illustration of the graph evolution process for the Erdo˝s - Re´nyi model . We start with N 5 10 isolated nodes ( up - per panel ) , then connect every pair of nodes with probability p . The lower panel of the ﬁgure shows two different stages in the graph’s development , corresponding to p 5 0 . 1 and p 5 0 . 15 . We can notice the emergence of trees ( a tree of order 3 , drawn with long - dashed lines ) and cycles ( a cycle of order 3 , drawn with short - dashed lines ) in the graph , and a connected cluster that unites half of the nodes at p 5 0 . 15 5 1 . 5 / N . 55 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 and none of its subgraphs is a cycle . The average degree of a tree of order k is ^ k & 5 2 2 2 / k , approaching 2 for large trees . Complete subgraphs of order k contain k nodes and all the possible k ( k 2 1 ) / 2 edges—in other words , they are completely connected . Let us consider the evolution process described in Fig . 5 for a graph G 5 G N , p . We start from N isolated nodes , then connect every pair of nodes with probability p . For small connection probabilities the edges are isolated , but as p , and with it the number of edges , increases , two edges can attach at a common node , forming a tree of order 3 . An interesting problem is to determine the criti - cal probability p c ( N ) at which almost every graph G contains a tree of order 3 . Most generally we can ask whether there is a critical probability that marks the ap - pearance of arbitrary subgraphs consisting of k nodes and l edges . In random - graph theory there is a rigorously proven answer to this question ( Bolloba´s , 1985 ) . Consider a ran - dom graph G 5 G N , p . In addition , consider a small graph F consisting of k nodes and l edges . In principle , the random graph G can contain several such subgraphs F . Our ﬁrst goal is to determine how many such sub - graphs exist . The k nodes can be chosen from the total number of nodes N in C Nk ways and the l edges are formed with probability p l . In addition , we can permute the k nodes and potentially obtain k ! new graphs ( the correct value is k ! / a , where a is the number of graphs that are isomorphic to each other ) . Thus the expected number of subgraphs F contained in G is E ~ X ! 5 C Nk k ! a p l . N k p l a . ( 6 ) This notation suggests that the actual number of such subgraphs , X , can be different from E ( X ) , but in the majority of cases it will be close to it . Note that the subgraphs do not have to be isolated , i . e . , there can exist edges with one node inside the subgraph but the other outside of it . Equation ( 6 ) indicates that if p ( N ) is such that p ( N ) N k / l ! 0 as N ! 0 , the expected number of sub - graphs E ( X ) ! 0 , i . e . , almost none of the random graphs contains a subgraph F . However , if p ( N ) 5 cN 2 k / l , the mean number of subgraphs is a ﬁnite number , denoted by l 5 c l / a , indicating that this function might be the critical probability . The validity of this ﬁnding can be tested by calculating the distribution of subgraph num - bers , P p ( X 5 r ) , obtaining ( Bolloba´s , 1985 ) lim N ! ‘ P p ~ X 5 r ! 5 e 2 l l r r ! . ( 7 ) The probability that G contains at least one subgraph F is then P p ~ G . F ! 5 ( r 5 1 ‘ P p ~ X 5 r ! 5 1 2 e 2 l , ( 8 ) which converges to 1 as c increases . For p values satis - fying pN k / l ! ‘ the probability P p ( G . F ) converges to 1 . Thus , indeed , the critical probability at which almost every graph contains a subgraph with k nodes and l edges is p c ( N ) 5 cN 2 k / l . A few important special cases directly follow from Eq . ( 8 ) : ( a ) The critical probability of having a tree of order k is p c ( N ) 5 cN 2 k / ( k 2 1 ) ; ( b ) The critical probability of having a cycle of order k is p c ( N ) 5 cN 2 1 ; ( c ) The critical probability of having a complete sub - graph of order k is p c ( N ) 5 cN 2 2 / ( k 2 1 ) . C . Graph evolution It is instructive to look at the results discussed above from a different point of view . Consider a random graph with N nodes and assume that the connection probabil - ity p ( N ) scales as N z , where z is a tunable parameter that can take any value between 2 ‘ and 0 ( Fig . 6 ) . For z less than 2 3 / 2 almost all graphs contain only isolated nodes and edges . When z passes through 2 3 / 2 , trees of order 3 suddenly appear . When z reaches 2 4 / 3 , trees of order 4 appear , and as z approaches 2 1 , the graph con - tains trees of larger and larger order . However , as long as z , 2 1 , such that the average degree of the graph ^ k & 5 pN ! 0 as N ! ‘ , the graph is a union of disjoint trees , and cycles are absent . Exactly when z passes through 2 1 , corresponding to ^ k & 5 const , even though z is changing smoothly , the asymptotic probability of cycles of all orders jumps from 0 to 1 . Cycles of order 3 can also be viewed as complete subgraphs of order 3 . Complete subgraphs of order 4 appear at z 52 2 / 3 , and as z continues to increase , complete subgraphs of larger and larger order continue to emerge . Finally , as z ap - proaches 0 , the graph contains complete subgraphs of all ﬁnite order . Further results can be derived for z 52 1 , i . e . , when we have p } N 2 1 and the average degree of the nodes is ^ k & 5 const . For p } N 2 1 a random graph contains trees and cycles of all order , but so far we have not discussed the size and structure of a typical graph component . A component of a graph is by deﬁnition a connected , iso - FIG . 6 . The threshold probabilities at which different sub - graphs appear in a random graph . For pN 3 / 2 ! 0 the graph consists of isolated nodes and edges . For p ; N 2 3 / 2 trees of order 3 appear , while for p ; N 2 4 / 3 trees of order 4 appear . At p ; N 2 1 trees of all orders are present , and at the same time cycles of all orders appear . The probability p ; N 2 2 / 3 marks the appearance of complete subgraphs of order 4 and p ; N 2 1 / 2 corresponds to complete subgraphs of order 5 . As z ap - proaches 0 , the graph contains complete subgraphs of increas - ing order . 56 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 lated subgraph , also called a cluster in network research and percolation theory . As Erdo˝s and Re´nyi ( 1960 ) show , there is an abrupt change in the cluster structure of a random graph as ^ k & approaches 1 . If 0 , ^ k & , 1 , almost surely all clusters are either trees or clusters containing exactly one cycle . Although cycles are present , almost all nodes belong to trees . The mean number of clusters is of order N 2 n , where n is the number of edges , i . e . , in this range when a new edge is added the number of clusters decreases by 1 . The largest cluster is a tree , and its size is proportional to ln N . When ^ k & passes the threshold ^ k & c 5 1 , the structure of the graph changes abruptly . While for ^ k & , 1 the greatest cluster is a tree , for ^ k & c 5 1 it has approxi - mately N 2 / 3 nodes and has a rather complex structure . Moreover for ^ k & . 1 the greatest ( giant ) cluster has @ 1 2 f ( ^ k & ) # N nodes , where f ( x ) is a function that de - creases exponentially from f ( 1 ) 5 1 to 0 for x ! ‘ . Thus a ﬁnite fraction S 5 1 2 f ( ^ k & ) of the nodes belongs to the largest cluster . Except for this giant cluster , all other clusters are relatively small , most of them being trees , the total number of nodes belonging to trees being Nf ( ^ k & ) . As ^ k & increases , the small clusters coalesce and join the giant cluster , the smaller clusters having the higher chance of survival . Thus at p c . 1 / N the random graph changes its topol - ogy abruptly from a loose collection of small clusters to a system dominated by a single giant cluster . The begin - ning of the supercritical phase was studied by Bolloba´s ( 1984 ) , Kolchin ( 1986 ) , and Luczak ( 1990 ) . Their results show that in this region the largest cluster clearly sepa - rates from the rest of the clusters , its size S increasing proportionally with the separation from the critical probability , S } ~ p 2 p c ! . ( 9 ) As we shall see in Sec . IV . F , this dependence is analo - gous to the scaling of the percolation probability in inﬁnite - dimensional percolation . D . Degree distribution Erdo˝s and Re´nyi ( 1959 ) were the ﬁrst to study the distribution of the maximum and minimum degree in a random graph , the full degree distribution being derived later by Bolloba´s ( 1981 ) . In a random graph with connection probability p the degree k i of a node i follows a binomial distribution with parameters N 2 1 and p : P ~ k i 5 k ! 5 C N 2 1 k p k ~ 1 2 p ! N 2 1 2 k . ( 10 ) This probability represents the number of ways in which k edges can be drawn from a certain node : the probabil - ity of k edges is p k , the probability of the absence of additional edges is ( 1 2 p ) N 2 1 2 k , and there are C N 2 1 k equivalent ways of selecting the k end points for these edges . Furthermore , if i and j are different nodes , P ( k i 5 k ) and P ( k j 5 k ) are close to being independent ran - dom variables . To ﬁnd the degree distribution of the graph , we need to study the number of nodes with de - gree k , X k . Our main goal is to determine the probabil - ity that X k takes on a given value , P ( X k 5 r ) . According to Eq . ( 10 ) , the expectation value of the number of nodes with degree k is E ~ X k ! 5 NP ~ k i 5 k ! 5 l k , ( 11 ) where l k 5 NC N 2 1 k p k ~ 1 2 p ! N 2 1 2 k . ( 12 ) As in the derivation of the existence conditions of subgraphs ( see Sec . III . B ) , the distribution of the X k values , P ( X k 5 r ) , approaches a Poisson distribution , P ~ X k 5 r ! 5 e 2 l k l kr r ! . ( 13 ) Thus the number of nodes with degree k follows a Pois - son distribution with mean value l k . Note that the ex - pectation value of the distribution ( 13 ) is the function l k given by Eq . ( 12 ) and not a constant . The Poisson dis - tribution decays rapidly for large values of r , the stan - dard deviation of the distribution being s k 5 A l k . With a bit of simpliﬁcation we could say that Eq . ( 13 ) implies that X k does not diverge much from the approximative result X k 5 NP ( k i 5 k ) , valid only if the nodes are inde - pendent ( see Fig . 7 ) . Thus with a good approximation the degree distribution of a random graph is a binomial distribution , P ~ k ! 5 C N 2 1 k p k ~ 1 2 p ! N 2 1 2 k , ( 14 ) which for large N can be replaced by a Poisson distribu - tion , P ~ k ! . e 2 pN ~ pN ! k k ! 5 e 2 ^ k & ^ k & k k ! . ( 15 ) Since the pioneering paper of Erdo ˝ s and Re ´ nyi , much work has concentrated on the existence and uniqueness FIG . 7 . The degree distribution that results from the numerical simulation of a random graph . We generated a single random graph with N 5 10 000 nodes and connection probability p 5 0 . 0015 , and calculated the number of nodes with degree k , X k . The plot compares X k / N with the expectation value of the Poisson distribution ( 13 ) , E ( X k ) / N 5 P ( k i 5 k ) , and we can see that the deviation is small . 57 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 of the minimum and maximum degree of a random graph . The results indicate that for a large range of p values both the maximum and the minimum degrees are determined and ﬁnite . For example , if p ( N ) ; N 2 1 2 1 / k ( and thus the graph is a set of isolated trees of order at most k 1 1 ) , almost no graph has nodes with degree higher than k . At the other extreme , if p 5 $ ln ( N ) 1 k ln @ ln ( N ) # 1 c % / N , almost every random graph has a minimum degree of at least k . Furthermore , for a sufﬁ - ciently high p , respectively , if pN / ln ( N ) ! ‘ , the maxi - mum degree of almost all random graphs has the same order of magnitude as the average degree . Thus , despite the fact that the position of the edges is random , a typi - cal random graph is rather homogeneous , the majority of the nodes having the same number of edges . E . Connectedness and diameter The diameter of a graph is the maximal distance be - tween any pair of its nodes . Strictly speaking , the diam - eter of a disconnected graph ( i . e . , one made up of sev - eral isolated clusters ) is inﬁnite , but it can be deﬁned as the maximum diameter of its clusters . Random graphs tend to have small diameters , provided p is not too small . The reason for this is that a random graph is likely to be spreading : with large probability the number of nodes at a distance l from a given node is not much smaller than ^ k & l . Equating ^ k & l with N we ﬁnd that the diameter is proportional to ln ( N ) / ln ( ^ k & ) ; thus it depends only logarithmically on the number of nodes . The diameter of a random graph has been studied by many authors ( see Chung and Lu , 2001 ) . A general con - clusion is that for most values of p , almost all graphs with the same N and p have precisely the same diameter . This means that when we consider all graphs with N nodes and connection probability p , the range of values in which the diameters of these graphs can vary is very small , usually concentrated around d 5 ln ~ N ! ln ~ pN ! 5 ln ~ N ! ln ~ ^ k & ! . ( 16 ) Below we summarize a few important results : • If ^ k & 5 pN , 1 , a typical graph is composed of isolated trees and its diameter equals the diameter of a tree . • If ^ k & . 1 , a giant cluster appears . The diameter of the graph equals the diameter of the giant cluster if ^ k & > 3 . 5 , and is proportional to ln ( N ) / ln ( ^ k & ) . • If ^ k & > ln ( N ) , almost every graph is totally connected . The diameters of the graphs having the same N and ^ k & are concentrated on a few values around ln ( N ) / ln ( ^ k & ) . Another way to characterize the spread of a random graph is to calculate the average distance between any pair of nodes , or the average path length . One expects that the average path length scales with the number of nodes in the same way as the diameter , l rand ; ln ~ N ! ln ~ ^ k & ! . ( 17 ) In Sec . II we presented evidence that the average path length of real networks is close to the average path length of random graphs with the same size . Equation ( 17 ) gives us an opportunity to better compare random graphs and real networks ( see Newman 2001a , 2001c ) . According to Eq . ( 17 ) , the product l rand ln ( ^ k & ) is equal to ln ( N ) , so plotting l rand ln ( ^ k & ) as a function of ln ( N ) for random graphs of different sizes gives a straight line of slope 1 . In Fig . 8 we plot a similar product for several real networks , l real log ( ^ k & ) , as a function of the net - work size , comparing it with the prediction of Eq . ( 17 ) . We can see that the trend of the data is similar to the theoretical prediction , and with several exceptions Eq . ( 17 ) gives a reasonable ﬁrst estimate . F . Clustering coefﬁcient As we mentioned in Sec . II , complex networks exhibit a large degree of clustering . If we consider a node in a random graph and its nearest neighbors , the probability that two of these neighbors are connected is equal to the probability that two randomly selected nodes are con - nected . Consequently the clustering coefﬁcient of a ran - dom graph is C rand 5 p 5 ^ k & N . ( 18 ) According to Eq . ( 18 ) , if we plot the ratio C rand / ^ k & as a function of N for random graphs of different sizes , on a log - log plot they will align along a straight line of slope 2 1 . In Fig . 9 we plot the ratio of the clustering coefﬁcient of real networks and their average degree as a function of their size , comparing it with the prediction of Eq . ( 18 ) . The plot convincingly indicates that real net - works do not follow the prediction of random graphs . The fraction C / ^ k & does not decrease as N 2 1 ; instead , it appears to be independent of N . This property is char - FIG . 8 . Comparison between the average path lengths of real networks and the prediction ( 17 ) of random - graph theory ( dashed line ) .

G . Graph spectra Any graph G with N nodes can be represented by its adjacency matrix A ( G ) with N 3 N elements A ij , whose value is A ij 5 A ji 5 1 if nodes i and j are connected , and 0 otherwise . The spectrum of graph G is the set of ei - genvalues of its adjacency matrix A ( G ) . A graph with N nodes has N eigenvalues l j , and it is useful to deﬁne its spectral density as r ~ l ! 5 1 N ( j 5 1 N d ~ l 2 l j ! , ( 19 ) which approaches a continuous function if N ! ‘ . The interest in spectral properties is related to the fact that the spectral density can be directly linked to the graph’s topological features , since its k th moment can be written as 1 N ( j 5 1 N ~ l j ! k 5 1 N ( i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i k A i 1 , i 2 A i 2 i 3 ﬂ A i k i 1 , ( 20 ) i . e . , the number of paths returning to the same node in the graph . Note that these paths can contain nodes that were already visited . Let us consider a random graph G N , p satisfying p ( N ) 5 cN 2 z . For z , 1 there is an inﬁnite cluster in the graph ( see Sec . III . C ) , and as N ! ‘ , any node belongs almost surely to the inﬁnite cluster . In this case the spec - tral density of the random graph converges to a semicir - cular distribution ( Fig . 10 ) , r ~ l ! 5 H A 4 Np ~ 1 2 p ! 2 l 2 2 p Np ~ 1 2 p ! if u l u , 2 A Np ~ 1 2 p ! 0 otherwise . ( 21 ) Known as Wigner’s law ( see Wigner , 1955 , 1957 , 1958 ) or the semicircle law , Eq . ( 21 ) has many applications in quantum , statistical , and solid - state physics ( Mehta , 1991 ; Crisanti et al . , 1993 ; Guhr et al . , 1998 ) . The largest ( principal ) eigenvalue , l 1 , is isolated from the bulk of the spectrum , and it increases with the network size as pN . When z . 1 the spectral density deviates from the semicircle law . The most striking feature of r ( l ) is that its odd moments are equal to zero , indicating that the only way that a path comes back to the original node is if it returns following exactly the same nodes . This is a salient feature of a tree structure , and , indeed , in Sec . III . B we have seen that in this case the random graph is composed of trees . IV . PERCOLATION THEORY One of the most interesting ﬁndings of random - graph theory is the existence of a critical probability at which a giant cluster forms . Translated into network language , the theory indicates the existence of a critical probability p c such that below p c the network is composed of iso - lated clusters but above p c a giant cluster spans the en - tire network . This phenomenon is markedly similar to a percolation transition , a topic much studied both in mathematics and in statistical mechanics ( Stauffer and Aharony , 1992 ; Bunde and Havlin , 1994 , 1996 ; Grim - mett , 1999 ; ben Avraham and Havlin , 2000 ) . Indeed , a percolation transition and the emergence of a giant clus - ter are the same phenomenon expressed in different lan - guages . Percolation theory , however , does not simply re - produce the predictions of random - graph theory . Asking questions from a different perspective , it addresses sev - eral issues that are crucial for understanding real net - works but are not discussed by random graph theory . Consequently it is important to review the predictions of FIG . 9 . Comparison between the clustering coefﬁcients of real networks and random graphs . All networks from Table I are included in the ﬁgure , the symbols being the same as in Fig . 8 . The dashed line corresponds to Eq . ( 18 ) . FIG . 10 .

Quantities of interest in percolation theory Consider a regular d - dimensional lattice whose edges are present with probability p and absent with probabil - ity 1 2 p . Percolation theory studies the emergence of paths that percolate through the lattice ( starting at one side and ending at the opposite side ) . For small p only a few edges are present , thus only small clusters of nodes connected by edges can form , but at a critical probability p c , called the percolation threshold , a percolating cluster of nodes connected by edges appears ( see Fig . 11 ) . This cluster is also called an inﬁnite cluster , because its size diverges as the size of the lattice increases . There are several much - studied versions of percolation , the one presented above being ‘‘bond percolation . ’’ The best - known alternative is site percolation , in which all bonds are present and the nodes of the lattice are occupied with probability p . In a manner similar to bond perco - lation , for small p only ﬁnite clusters of occupied nodes are present , but for p . p c an inﬁnite cluster appears . The main quantities of interest in percolation are the following : ( 1 ) The percolation probability P , denoting the prob - ability that a given node belongs to the inﬁnite clus - ter : P 5 P p ~ u C u 5 ‘ ! 5 1 2 ( s , ‘ P p ~ u C u 5 s ! , ( 22 ) where P p ( u C u 5 s ) denotes the probability that the cluster at the origin has size s . Obviously P 5 H 0 if p , p c . 0 if p . p c . ( 23 ) ( 2 ) The average cluster size ^ s & , deﬁned as ^ s & 5 E p ~ u C u ! 5 ( s 5 1 ‘ sP p ~ u C u 5 s ! , ( 24 ) giving the expectation value of cluster sizes . Because ^ s & is inﬁnite when P . 0 , in this case it is useful to work with the average size of the ﬁnite clusters by taking away from the system the inﬁnite ( u C u 5 ‘ ) cluster ^ s & f 5 E p ~ u C u , u C u , ‘ ! 5 ( s , ‘ sP p ~ u C u 5 s ! . ( 25 ) ( 3 ) The cluster size distribution n s , deﬁned as the prob - ability of a node’s having a ﬁxed position in a cluster of size s ( for example , being its left - hand end , if this position is uniquely deﬁned ) , n s 5 1 s P p ~ u C u 5 s ! . ( 26 ) Note that n s does not coincide with the probability that a node is part of a cluster of size s . By ﬁxing the position of the node in the cluster we are choosing only one of the s possible nodes , reﬂected in the fact that P p ( u C u 5 s ) is divided by s , guaranteeing that we count every cluster only once . These quantities are of interest in random networks as well . There is , however , an important difference be - tween percolation theory and random networks : perco - lation theory is deﬁned on a regular d - dimensional lat - tice . In a random network ( or graph ) we can deﬁne a nonmetric distance along the edges , but since any node can be connected by an edge to any other node in the network , there is no regular small - dimensional lattice in which a network can be embedded . However , as we dis - cuss below , random networks and percolation theory meet exactly in the inﬁnite - dimensional limit ( d ! ‘ ) of percolation . Fortunately many results in percolation theory can be generalized to inﬁnite dimensions . Conse - quently the results obtained within the context of perco - lation apply directly to random networks as well . B . General results 1 . The subcritical phase ( p , p c ) When p , p c , only small clusters of nodes connected by edges are present in the system . The questions asked in this phase are ( i ) what is the probability that there exists a path x $ y joining two randomly chosen nodes x and y ? and ( ii ) what is the rate of decay of P p ( u C u 5 s ) when s ! ‘ ? The ﬁrst result of this type was obtained by Hammersley ( 1957 ) , who showed that the probability of a path’s joining the origin with a node on the surface , ] B ( r ) , of a box centered at the origin and with side length 2 r decays exponentially if P , ‘ . We can deﬁne a correlation length j as the characteristic length of the exponential decay P p @ 0 $ ] B ~ r ! # ; e 2 r / j , ( 27 ) where 0 $ ] B ( r ) means that there is a path from the origin to an arbitrary node on ] B ( r ) . Equation ( 27 ) in - dicates that the radius of the ﬁnite clusters in the sub - critical region has an exponentially decaying tail , and the correlation length represents the mean radius of a ﬁnite cluster . It was shown ( see Grimmett , 1999 ) that j is equal to 0 for p 5 0 and goes to inﬁnity as p ! p c . FIG . 11 . Illustration of bond percolation in 2D . The nodes are placed on a 25 3 25 square lattice , and two nodes are connected by an edge with probability p . For p 5 0 . 315 ( left ) , which is below the percolation threshold p c 5 0 . 5 , the connected nodes form isolated clusters . For p 5 0 . 525 ( right ) , which is above the percolation threshold , the largest cluster percolates . 60 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 The exponential decay of cluster radii implies that the probability that a cluster has size s , P p ( u C u 5 s ) , also decays exponentially for large s : P p ~ u C u 5 s ! ; e 2 a ( p ) s as s ! ‘ , ( 28 ) where a ( p ) ! ‘ as p ! 0 and a ( p c ) 5 0 . 2 . The supercritical phase ( p . p c ) For P . 0 there is exactly one inﬁnite cluster ( Burton and Keane , 1989 ) . In this supercritical phase the previ - ously studied quantities are dominated by the contribu - tion of the inﬁnite cluster ; thus it is useful to study the corresponding probabilities in terms of ﬁnite clusters . The probability that there is a path from the origin to the surface of a box of edge length 2 r that is not part of the inﬁnite cluster decays exponentially as P p @ 0 $ ] B ~ r ! , u C u , ‘ # ; e 2 r / j . ( 29 ) Unlike the subcritical phase , though , the decay of the cluster sizes , P p ( u C u 5 s , ‘ ) , follows a stretch exponen - tial , e 2 b ( p ) s ( d 2 1 ) / d , offering the ﬁrst important quantity that depends on the dimensionality of the lattice , but even this dependence vanishes as d ! ‘ , and the cluster size distribution decays exponentially as in the subcriti - cal phase . C . Exact solutions : Percolation on a Cayley tree The Cayley tree ( or Bethe lattice ) is a loopless struc - ture ( see Fig . 12 ) in which every node has z neighbors , with the exception of the nodes at the surface . While the surface and volume of a regular d - dimensional object obey the scaling relation surface } volume 1 2 1 / d , and only in the limit d ! ‘ is the surface proportional with the volume , for a Cayley tree the number of nodes on the surface is proportional to the total number of nodes ( i . e . , the volume of the tree ) . Thus in this respect a Cayley tree represents an inﬁnite - dimensional object . Another argument for the inﬁnite dimensionality of a Cayley tree is that it has no loops ( cycles in graph - theoretic lan - guage ) . Thus , despite its regular topology , the Cayley tree represents a reasonable approximation of the topol - ogy of a random network in the subcritical phase , where all the clusters are trees . This is no longer true in the supercritical phase , because at the critical probability p c ( N ) , cycles of all order appear in the graph ( see Sec . III . C ) . To investigate percolation on a Cayley tree , we as - sume that each edge is present with probability p . Next we discuss the main quantities of interest for this system . ( a ) Percolation threshold : The condition for the exis - tence of an inﬁnite path starting from the origin is that at least one of the z 2 1 possible outgoing edges of a node is present , i . e . , ( z 2 1 ) p > 1 . There - fore the percolation threshold is p c 5 1 z 2 1 . ( 30 ) ( b ) Percolation probability : For a Cayley tree with z 5 3 , for which p c 5 1 / 2 , the percolation probability is given by ( Stauffer and Aharony , 1992 ) P 5 H 0 if p , p c 5 1 2 ~ 2 p 2 1 ! / p 2 if p . p c 5 1 2 . ( 31 ) The Taylor series expansion around p c 5 12 gives P . 8 ( p 2 12 ) , thus the percolation probability is pro - portional to the deviation from the percolation threshold P } ~ p 2 p c ! as p ! p c . ( 32 ) ( c ) Mean cluster size : The average cluster size is given by ^ s & 5 ( n 5 1 ‘ 3 3 2 n 2 1 p n 5 3 2 1 1 2 2 p 5 3 4 ~ p c 2 p ! 2 1 . ( 33 ) Note that ^ s & diverges as p ! p c , and it depends on p as a power of the distance p c 2 p from the perco - lation threshold . This behavior is an example of critical phenomena : an order parameter goes to zero following a power law in the vicinity of the critical point ( Stanley , 1971 ; Ma , 1976 ) . ( d ) Cluster size distribution : The probability of having a cluster of size s is ( Durett , 1985 ) P p ~ u C u 5 s ! 5 1 s C 2 ss 2 1 p s 2 1 ~ 1 2 p ! s 1 1 . ( 34 ) Here the number of edges surrounding the s nodes is 2 s , from which the s 2 1 inside edges have to be present and the s 1 1 external ones absent . The fac - tor C 2 ss 2 1 takes into account the different cases that FIG . 12 . Example of a Cayley tree with coordination number z 5 3 . All of the nodes have three edges , with the exception of those on the surface , which have only one edge . The ratio between the number of nodes on the surface and the total number of nodes approaches a constant , ( z 2 2 ) / ( z 2 1 ) , a property valid only for inﬁnite - dimensional objects . The aver - age degree approaches ^ k & 5 2 as the size of the tree goes to inﬁnity , a property held in common with random trees ( see Sec . III . B ) . 61 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 can be obtained when permuting the edges , and the 1 / s is a normalization factor . Since n s 5 ( 1 / s ) P p ( u C u 5 s ) , after using Stirling’s formula we obtain n s } s 2 5 / 2 p s 2 1 ~ 1 2 p ! s 1 1 . ( 35 ) In the vicinity of the percolation threshold this ex - pression can be approximated as n s ; s 2 5 / 2 e 2 cs with c } ~ p 2 p c ! 2 . ( 36 ) Thus the cluster size distribution follows a power law with an exponential cutoff : only clusters with size s , s j 5 1 / c } ( p 2 p c ) 2 2 contribute signiﬁcantly to cluster averages . For these clusters , n s is effec - tively equal to n s ( p c ) } s 2 5 / 2 . Clusters with s @ s j are exponentially rare , and their properties are no longer dominated by the behavior at p c . The no - tation s j illustrates that as the correlation length j is the characteristic length scale for the cluster di - ameters , s j is an intrinsic characteristic of cluster sizes . The correlation length of a tree is not well deﬁned , but we shall see in the more general cases that s j and j are related by a simple power law . D . Scaling in the critical region The principal ansatz of percolation theory is that even the most general percolation problem in any dimension obeys a scaling relation similar to Eq . ( 36 ) near the per - colation threshold . Thus in general the cluster size dis - tribution can be written as n s ~ p ! ; H s 2 t f 2 ~ u p 2 p c u 1 / s s ! as p < p c s 2 t f 1 ~ u p 2 p c u 1 / s s ! as p > p c . ( 37 ) Here t and s are critical exponents whose numerical value needs to be determined , f 2 and f 1 are smooth functions on [ 0 , ‘ ) , and f 2 ( 0 ) 5 f 1 ( 0 ) . The results of Sec . IV . B suggest that f 2 ( x ) . e 2 Ax and f 1 ( x ) . e 2 Bx ( d 2 1 ) / d for x @ 1 . This ansatz indicates that the role of s j } u p 2 p c u 2 1 / s as a cutoff is the same as in a Cayley tree . The general form ( 37 ) contains as a special case the Cayley tree ( 36 ) with t 5 5 / 2 , s 5 1 / 2 , and f 6 ( x ) 5 e 2 x . Another element of the scaling hypothesis is that the correlation length diverges near the percolation thresh - old following a power law : j ~ p ! ; u p 2 p c u 2 n as p ! p c . ( 38 ) This ansatz introduces the correlation exponent n and indicates that j and s j are related by a power law s j 5 j 1 / sn . From these two hypotheses we ﬁnd that the per - colation probability ( 22 ) is given by P ; ~ p 2 p c ! b with b 5 t 2 2 s , ( 39 ) which scales as a positive power of p 2 p c for p > p c ; thus it is 0 for p 5 p c and increases when p . p c . The average size of ﬁnite clusters , ^ s & f , which can be calcu - lated on both sides of the percolation threshold , obeys ^ s & f ; u p 2 p c u 2 g with g 5 3 2 t s , ( 40 ) diverging for p ! p c . The exponents b and g are called the critical exponents of the percolation probability and average cluster size , respectively . E . Cluster structure Until now we have discussed cluster sizes and radii , ignoring their internal structure . Let us now consider the perimeter of a cluster t denoting the number of nodes situated on the most external edges ( the leaf nodes ) . The perimeter t s of a very large but ﬁnite cluster of size s scales as ( Leath , 1976 ) t s 5 s 1 2 p p 1 As z as s ! ‘ , ( 41 ) where z 5 1 for p , p c and z 5 1 2 1 / d for p . p c . Thus below p c the perimeter of a cluster is proportional to its volume , a highly irregular property , which is neverthe - less true for trees , including the Cayley tree . Another way of understanding the unusual structure of ﬁnite clusters is by looking at the relation between their radii and volume . The correlation length j is a measure of the mean cluster radius , and we know that j scales with the cutoff cluster size s j as j } s j 1 / ns . Thus ﬁnite clusters are fractals ( see Mandelbrot , 1982 ) be - cause their size does not scale as their radius to the d th power , but as s ~ r ! ; r d f , ( 42 ) where d f 5 1 / sn . It can also be shown that at the perco - lation threshold an inﬁnite cluster is still a fractal , but for p . p c it becomes a normal d - dimensional object . While the cluster radii and the correlation length j are deﬁned using Euclidian distances on the lattice , the chemical distance is deﬁned as the length of the shortest path between two arbitrary sites on a cluster ( Havlin and Nossal , 1984 ) . Thus the chemical distance is the equivalent of the distance on random graphs . The num - ber of nodes within chemical distance l scales as s ~ l ! ; l d l , ( 43 ) where d l is called the graph dimension of the cluster . While the fractal dimension d f of the Euclidian distances has been related to the other critical exponents , no such relation has yet been found for the graph dimension d l . F . Inﬁnite - dimensional percolation Percolation is known to have a critical dimension d c , below which some exponents depend on d , but for any dimension above d c the exponents are the same . While it is generally believed that the critical dimension of per - colation is d c 5 6 , the dimension independence of the critical exponents is proven rigorously only for d > 19 ( see Hara and Slade , 1990 ) . Thus for d . d c the results of inﬁnite - dimensional percolation theory apply , which pre - dict that 62 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 • P ; ( p 2 p c ) as p ! p c ; • ^ s & ; ( p c 2 p ) 2 1 as p ! p c ; • n s ; s 2 5 / 2 e 2 u p 2 p c u 2 s as p ! p c ; • j ; u p 2 p c u 2 1 / 2 as p ! p c . Consequently the critical exponents of inﬁnite - dimensional percolation are t ‘ 5 5 / 2 , s ‘ 5 1 / 2 , and n ‘ 5 1 / 2 . The fractal dimension of an inﬁnite cluster at the percolation threshold is d f 5 4 , while the graph dimen - sion is d l 5 2 ( Bunde and Havlin , 1996 ) . Thus the char - acteristic chemical distance on a ﬁnite cluster or inﬁnite cluster at the percolation threshold scales with its size as l ; s 2 / d f 5 s 1 / 2 . ( 44 ) G . Parallels between random - graph theory and percolation In random - graph theory we study a graph of N nodes , each pair of nodes being connected with probability p . This corresponds to percolation in at most N dimen - sions , such that each two connected nodes are neigh - bors , and the edges between graph nodes are the edges in the percolation problem . Since random - graph theory investigates the N ! ‘ regime , it is analogous to inﬁnite - dimensional percolation . We have seen in Sec . IV . C that inﬁnite - dimensional percolation is similar to percolation on a Cayley tree . The percolation threshold of a Cayley tree is p c 5 1 / ( z 2 1 ) , where z is the coordination number of the tree . In a random graph of N nodes the coordination number is N 2 1 ; thus the ‘‘percolation threshold , ’’ denoting the connection probability at which a giant cluster appears , should be p c . 1 / N . Indeed , this is exactly the probability at which the phase transition leading to a giant compo - nent appears in random graphs , as Erdo˝s and Re´nyi showed ( see Sec . III . C ) . Compare the predictions of random - graph theory and inﬁnite - dimensional percolation , some of which reﬂect a complete analogy : ( 1 ) For p , p c 5 1 / N • The probability of a giant cluster in a graph , and of an inﬁnite cluster in percolation , is equal to 0 . • The clusters of a random graph are trees , while the clusters in percolation have a fractal structure and a perimeter proportional with their volume . • The largest cluster in a random graph is a tree with ln ( N ) nodes , while in general for percolation P p ( u C u 5 s ) ; e 2 s / s j [ see Eq . ( 28 ) in Sec . IV . B ] , suggesting that the size of the largest cluster scales as ln ( N ) . ( 2 ) For p 5 p c 5 1 / N • A unique giant cluster or an inﬁnite cluster appears . • The size of the giant cluster is N 2 / 3 ; while for inﬁnite - dimensional percolation P p ( u C u 5 s ) ; s 2 3 / 2 , thus the size of the largest cluster scales as N 2 / 3 . ( 3 ) For p . p c 5 1 / N • The size of the giant cluster is (cid:132) f ( p c N ) 2 f ( pN ) (cid:133) N , where f is an exponentially decreasing function with f ( 1 ) 5 1 . The size of the inﬁnite cluster is PN } ( p 2 p c ) N . • The giant cluster has a complex structure containing cycles , while the inﬁnite cluster is no longer fractal , but compact . All these correspondences indicate that the phase transition in random graphs belongs in the same univer - sality class as mean - ﬁeld percolation . Numerical simula - tions of random graphs ( see , for example , Christensen et al . , 1998 ) have conﬁrmed that the critical exponents of the phase transition are equal to the critical exponents of inﬁnite - dimensional percolation . The equivalence of these two theories is very important because it offers us different perspectives on the same problem . For ex - ample , it is often of interest to look at the cluster size distribution of a random network with a ﬁxed number of nodes . This question is answered in a simpler way in percolation theory . However , random - graph theory an - swers questions of major importance for networks , such as the appearance of trees and cycles , which are largely ignored by percolation theory . In some cases there is an apparent discrepancy be - tween the predictions of random - graph theory and per - colation theory . For example , percolation theory pre - dicts that the chemical distance between two nodes in an inﬁnite cluster scales as a power of the size of the cluster [ see Eq . ( 44 ) ] . However , random - graph theory predicts [ Eq . ( 16 ) ] that the diameter of an inﬁnite cluster scales logarithmically with its size ( see Chung and Lu , 2001 ) . The origin of the apparent discrepancy is that these two predictions refer to different regimes . While Eq . ( 44 ) is valid only when the inﬁnite cluster is barely formed [ i . e . , p 5 p c and ^ k & 5 1 ] and is still a fractal , the prediction of random - graph theory is valid only well beyond the per - colation transition , when ^ k & @ 1 . Consequently , by using these two limits we can address the evolution of the chemical distance in an inﬁnite cluster ( see Cohen et al . , 2001 ) . Thus for a full characterization of random net - works we need to be aware of both of these complemen - tary approaches . V . GENERALIZED RANDOM GRAPHS In Sec . II we have seen that real networks differ from random graphs in that often their degree distribution follows a power law P ( k ) ; k 2 g . Since power laws are free of a characteristic scale , these networks are called ‘‘scale - free networks’’ ( Baraba´si and Albert , 1999 ; Bara - ba´si , Albert , and Jeong , 1999 ) . As random graphs do not capture the scale - free character of real networks , we need a different model to describe these systems . One approach is to generalize random graphs by constructing a model that has the degree distribution as an input but is random in all other respects . In other words , the edges connect randomly selected nodes , with the constraint that the degree distribution is restricted to a power law . The theory of such semirandom graphs should answer similar questions to those asked by Erdo˝s and Re´nyi and percolation theory ( see Secs . III , IV ) : Is there a thresh - old at which a giant cluster appears ? How do the size and topology of the clusters evolve ? When does the 63 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 graph become connected ? In addition , we need to deter - mine the average path length and clustering coefﬁcient of such graphs . The ﬁrst step in developing such a theory is to identify the relevant parameter that , together with the network size , gives a statistically complete characterization of the network . In the case of random graphs this parameter is the connection probability ( see Sec . III . A ) ; for percola - tion theory it is the bond occupation probability ( see Sec . IV ) . Since the only restriction for these graphs is that their degree distribution follow a power law , the exponent g of the degree distribution could play the role of the control parameter . Accordingly , we study scale - free random networks by systematically varying g and see if there is a threshold value of g at which the net - works’ important properties abruptly change . We start by sketching a few intuitive expectations . Consider a large network with degree distribution P ( k ) ; k 2 g , in which g decreases from ‘ to 0 . The av - erage degree of the network , or equivalently , the num - ber of edges , increases as g decreases , since ^ k & ; k max 2 g 1 2 , where k max , N is the maximum degree of the graph . This is very similar to the graph evolution process described by Erdo˝s and Re´nyi ( see Sec . III . C ) . Conse - quently we expect that , while at large g the network consists of isolated small clusters , there is a critical value of g at which a giant cluster forms , and at an even smaller g the network becomes completely connected . The theory of random graphs with given degree se - quence is relatively recent . One of the ﬁrst results is due to Luczak ( 1992 ) , who showed that almost all random graphs with a ﬁxed degree distribution and no nodes of degree smaller than 2 have a unique giant cluster . Mol - loy and Reed ( 1995 , 1998 ) have proven that for a ran - dom graph with degree distribution P ( k ) an inﬁnite cluster emerges almost surely when Q [ ( k > 1 k ~ k 2 2 ! P ~ k ! . 0 , ( 45 ) provided that the maximum degree is less than N 1 / 4 . The method of Molloy and Reed was applied to random graphs with power - law degree distributions by Aiello , Chung , and Lu ( 2000 ) . As we show next , their results are in excellent agreement with the expectations outlined above . A . Thresholds in a scale - free random graph Aiello , Chung , and Lu ( 2000 ) introduce a two - parameter random - graph model P ( a , g ) deﬁned as fol - lows : Let N k be the number of nodes with degree k . P ( a , g ) assigns uniform probability to all graphs with N k 5 e a k 2 g . Thus in this model it is not the total number of nodes that is speciﬁed—along with the exponent g —from the beginning , but the number of nodes with degree 1 . Nevertheless the number of nodes and edges in the graph can be deduced , noting that the maximum degree of the graph is e a / g . To ﬁnd the condition for the appearance of a giant cluster in this model , we insert P ( a , g ) into Eq . ( 45 ) , ﬁnding as a solution g 0 5 3 . 478 75 . . . . Thus when g . g 0 the random graph al - most surely has no inﬁnite cluster . On the other hand , when g , g 0 there is almost surely a unique inﬁnite clus - ter . An important question is whether the graph is con - nected or not . Certainly for g . g 0 the graph is discon - nected as it is made of independent ﬁnite clusters . In the 0 , g , g 0 regime Aiello , Chung , and Lu ( 2000 ) study the size of the second - largest cluster , ﬁnding that for 2 < g < g 0 the second - largest cluster almost surely has a size of the order of ln N ; thus it is relatively small . However , for 1 , g , 2 almost surely every node with degree greater than ln ( N ) belongs to the inﬁnite cluster . The second - largest cluster has a size of order 1 , i . e . , its size does not increase as the size of the graph goes to inﬁnity . This means that the fraction of nodes in the inﬁnite clus - ter approaches 1 as the system size increases ; thus the graph becomes totally connected in the limit of inﬁnite system size . Finally , for 0 , g , 1 the graph is almost surely connected . B . Generating function formalism A general approach to random graphs with given de - gree distribution was developed by Newman , Strogatz , and Watts ( 2001 ) using a generating function formalism ( Wilf , 1990 ) . The generating function of the degree dis - tribution , G 0 ~ x ! 5 ( k 5 0 ‘ P ~ k ! x k , ( 46 ) encapsulates all the information contained in P ( k ) , since P ~ k ! 5 1 k ! d k G 0 dx k U x 5 0 . ( 47 ) An important quantity for studying cluster structure is the generating function for the degree distribution of the nearest neighbors of a randomly selected node . This can be obtained in the following way : a randomly selected edge reaches a node with degree k with probability pro - portional to kP ( k ) ( i . e . , it is easier to ﬁnd a well - connected node ) . If we start from a randomly chosen node and follow each of the edges starting from it , then the nodes we visit have their degree distribution gener - ated by kP ( k ) . In addition , the generating function will contain a term x k 2 1 [ instead of x k as in Eq . ( 46 ) ] be - cause we have to discount the edge through which we reached the node . Thus the distribution of outgoing edges is generated by the function G 1 ~ x ! 5 ( k kP ~ k ! x k 2 1 ( k kP ~ k ! 5 1 ^ k & G 0 8 ~ x ! . ( 48 ) The average number of ﬁrst neighbors is equal to the average degree of the graph , z 1 5 ^ k & 5 ( k kP ~ k ! 5 G 0 8 ~ 1 ! . ( 49 ) 64 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 1 . Component sizes and phase transitions When we identify a cluster using a burning ( breadth - ﬁrst - search ) algorithm , we start from an arbitrary node and follow its edges until we reach its nearest neighbors . We record these nodes as part of the cluster , then follow their outside edges ( avoiding the already recorded nodes ) and record the nodes we arrive at as next - nearest neighbors of the starting node . This process is repeated until no new nodes are found , the set of identiﬁed nodes forming an isolated cluster . This algorithm is implicitly incorporated into the generating function method . The generating function , H 1 ( x ) , for the size distribution of the clusters reached by following a random edge satisﬁes the iterative equation H 1 ~ x ! 5 ( k kP ~ k ! @ H 1 ~ x ! # k ( k kP ~ k ! 5 xG 1 @ H 1 ~ x ! # . ( 50 ) Here kP ( k ) is proportional to the probability that a random edge arrives at a node with degree k , and @ H 1 ( x ) # k represents the k ways in which the cluster can be continued recursively ( i . e . , by ﬁnding the nearest neighbors of a previously found node ) . If we start at a randomly chosen node then we have one such cluster at the end of each edge leaving that node , and hence the generating function for the size of the whole cluster is H 0 ~ x ! 5 x ( k P ~ k ! @ H 1 ~ x ! # k 5 xG 0 @ H 1 ~ x ! # . ( 51 ) When there is no giant cluster present in the graph , the average cluster size is given by ^ s & 5 H 0 8 ~ 1 ! 5 1 1 G 0 8 ~ 1 ! 1 2 G 1 8 ~ 1 ! . ( 52 ) This expression diverges when G 1 8 ( 1 ) 5 1 , indicating the appearance of a giant cluster . Substituting the deﬁnition of G 0 ( x ) we can write the condition of the emergence of the giant cluster as ( k k ~ k 2 2 ! P ~ k ! 5 0 , ( 53 ) identical to Eq . ( 45 ) derived by Molloy and Reed ( 1995 ) . Equation ( 53 ) gives an implicit relation for the critical degree distribution of a random graph : For any degree distribution for which the sum on the left - hand side is negative , no giant cluster is present in the graph , but degree distributions that give a positive sum lead to the appearance of a giant cluster . When a giant cluster is present , H 0 ( x ) generates the probability distribution of the ﬁnite clusters . This means that H 0 ( 1 ) is no longer unity but instead takes on the value 1 2 S , where S is the fraction of nodes in the giant cluster . We can use this to calculate the size of the giant cluster S as ( Molloy and Reed , 1998 ) S 5 1 2 G 0 ~ u ! , ( 54 ) where u is the smallest non - negative real solution of the equation u 5 G 1 ( u ) . Since we are dealing with random graphs ( although with an arbitrary degree distribution ) , percolation theory ( see Sec . IV ) indicates that close to the phase transition the tail of cluster size distribution , n s , behaves as n s ; s 2 t e 2 s / s j . ( 55 ) The characteristic cluster size s j can be related to the ﬁrst singularity of H 0 ( x ) , x * , and at the phase transition x * 5 1 and s j ! ‘ . Using a Taylor expansion around the critical point , we ﬁnd that H 0 ( x ) scales as H 0 ~ x ! ; ~ 1 2 x ! a as x ! 1 , ( 56 ) with a 5 12 . This exponent can be related to the exponent t by using the connection between n s and H 0 ( x ) , ob - taining t 5 a 1 2 5 52 , regardless of degree distribution . Thus close to the critical point the cluster size distribu - tion follows n sc ; s 2 5 / 2 , as predicted by inﬁnite - dimensional percolation ( Sec . IV . F ) , but now extended to a large family of random graphs with arbitrary degree distribution . 2 . Average path length Extending the method of calculating the average num - ber of nearest neighbors , we ﬁnd the average number of m th neighbors , z m 5 @ G 1 8 ~ 1 ! # m 2 1 G 0 8 ~ 1 ! 5 F z 2 z 1 G m 2 1 z 1 , ( 57 ) where z 1 and z 2 are the numbers of nearest and next - nearest neighbors . Using this expression , we can derive an approximative relation for the average path length of the graph . Let us start from a given node and ﬁnd the number of its nearest , next - nearest , . . . , m th neighbors . Assuming that all nodes in the graph can be reached within l steps , we have 1 1 ( m 5 1 l n ~ m ! 5 N , ( 58 ) where n ( m ) is the number of m th neighbors of the ini - tial node . To estimate the average path length , we can replace n ( m ) with z m , obtaining 1 1 ( m 5 1 l z m 5 N . ( 59 ) As for most graphs N @ z 1 and z 2 @ z 1 , we obtain l 5 ln ~ N / z 1 ! ln ~ z 2 / z 1 ! 1 1 . ( 60 ) A more rigorous method exists in the case of connected tree graphs ( Ambjorn , Durhuus , and Jonsson , 1990 ; Burda , Correia , and Krzywicki , 2001 ) , yielding that the average pathlength of connected trees with power - law degree distribution scales as N ( g 2 2 ) / ( g 2 1 ) , where g is the degree exponent . Although this scaling has a different functional form , for g approaching 2 the dependence on the system size becomes very weak and practically indis - tinguishable from a logarithmic dependence . 65 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 C . Random graphs with power - law degree distribution As an application of the generating function formal - ism , Newman , Strogatz , and Watts ( 2001 ) consider the case of a degree distribution of type P ~ k ! 5 Ck 2 g e 2 k / k for k > 1 , ( 61 ) where C , g , and k are constants . The exponential cutoff , present in some social and biological networks ( see Amaral et al . , 2000 ; Jeong , Mason , et al . , 2001 ; Newman 2001a ) , has the technical advantage of making the distri - bution normalizable for all g , not just g > 2 , as in the case of a pure power law . The constant C is ﬁxed by normalization , giving C 5 @ Li g ( e 2 1 / k ) # 2 1 , where Li n ( x ) is the n th polylogarithm of x . Thus the degree distribu - tion is characterized by two independent parameters , the exponent g and the cutoff k . Following the formal - ism described above , we ﬁnd that the size of an inﬁnite cluster is S 5 1 2 Li g ~ ue 2 1 / k ! Li g ~ e 2 1 / k ! , ( 62 ) where u is the smallest non - negative real solution of the equation u 5 Li g 2 1 ( ue 2 1 / k ) / @ uLi g 2 1 ( e 2 1 / k ) # . For graphs with purely power - law distribution ( k ! ‘ ) , the above equation becomes u 5 Li g 2 1 ( u ) / @ u z ( g 2 1 ) # , where z ( x ) is the Riemann z function . For all g < 2 this gives u 5 0 , and hence S 5 1 , implying that a randomly chosen node belongs to the giant cluster with probability converging to 1 as k ! ‘ . For graphs with g . 2 this is never the case , even for inﬁnite k , indicating that such a graph contains ﬁnite clusters , i . e . , it is not connected , in agreement with the conclusions of Aiello , Chung , and Lu ( 2000 ) . The average path length is l 5 ln N 1 ln @ Li g ~ e 2 1 / k ! / Li g 2 1 ~ e 2 1 / k ! # ln @ Li g 2 2 ~ e 2 1 / k ! / Li g 2 1 ~ e 2 1 / k ! 2 1 # 1 1 , ( 63 ) which in the limit k ! ‘ becomes l 5 ln N 1 ln @ z ~ g ! / z ~ g 2 1 ! # ln @ z ~ g 2 2 ! / z ~ g 2 1 ! 2 1 # 1 1 . ( 64 ) Note that this expression does not have a ﬁnite positive real value for any g , 3 , indicating that one must specify a ﬁnite cutoff k for the degree distribution to get a well - deﬁned average path length . Equations ( 60 ) and ( 63 ) reproduce the result of ﬁnite size scaling simulations of the World Wide Web , indicating that its average path length scales logarithmically with its size ( Albert , Jeong , and Baraba´si , 1999 ) . But do they offer a good estimate for the average path lengths of real networks ? In Sec . II we saw that the prediction of random - graph theory is in qualitative agreement with the average path lengths of real networks , but that there also are signiﬁcant devia - tions from it . It is thus important to see if taking into account the correct degree distribution gives a better ﬁt . In Fig . 13 we compare the prediction of Eq . ( 63 ) with the average path length of a real network by plotting A ( l 2 1 ) 2 B as a function of the network size N , where A 5 log @ Li g 2 2 ( e 2 1 / k ) / Li g 2 1 ( e 2 1 / k ) 2 1 # and B 5 log @ Li g ( e 2 1 / k ) / Li g 2 1 ( e 2 1 / k ) # , and we use the cutoff length k as obtained from the empirical degree distribu - tions . For directed networks we used the g out values . For random networks with the same N , g , and k as the real networks , the A l 2 B values would align along a straight line with slope 1 in a log - linear plot , given by the dashed line on the ﬁgure . The actual values for real net - works obey the trend , but they seem to be systematically larger than the prediction of Eq . ( 63 ) , indicating that the average path lengths of real networks are larger than those of random graphs with power - law degree distribu - tion . This conclusion is further supported by the last three columns of Table II , which directly compare the average path lengths of real networks with power - law degree distribution l real , with the estimates of random - graph theory l rand , and with scale - free random - graph theory l pow . We can see that the general trend is for l real to be larger than both l pow and l rand , an indica - tion of the nonrandom aspects of the topology of real networks . D . Bipartite graphs and the clustering coefﬁcient The clustering coefﬁcient of a scale - free random graph has not yet been calculated in the literature , but we can get some idea of its general characteristics if we take into account that scale - free random graphs are similar to Erdo˝s - Re´nyi random graphs in the sense that their edges are distributed randomly . Consequently the clustering coefﬁcients of scale - free random graphs con - verge to 0 as the network size increases . It is worth noting , however , that some of the real - world networks presented in Sec . II , for example , the collaboration networks , can be more completely de - scribed by bipartite graphs ( Newman , Strogatz , and Watts , 2001 ) . In a bipartite graph there are two kinds of FIG . 13 . Comparison between the average path lengths of real scale - free networks and the prediction ( 63 ) of scale - free ran - dom graphs ( dashed line ) . For each network we have plotted A ( l 2 1 ) 2 B as a function of N , where A and B are given in the text . The networks included in the ﬁgure , indicated by their number in Table I or Table II , are small s , I . 12 ; large s , I . 13 ; small h , I . 10 ; medium h , I . 11 ; large h , II . 13 ; small d , II . 6 ; medium d , I . 2 ; small v , I . 6 ; large v , I . 8 ; large d , II . 7 ; , , I . 9 ; x , I . 3 ; medium l , II . 1 ; large , l II . 3 . 66 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 nodes , and edges connect only nodes of different kinds . For example , the collaboration network of movie actors is in fact a projection of a bipartite actor - movie graph , in which the two types of nodes are the actors and movies , and an edge connects each movie with the actors playing in it ( see Fig . 14 ) . The same approach is applicable to the collaborations between scientists ( where scientists and papers are the two types of nodes ) and metabolic networks ( where nodes can be the substrates or reac - tions ) . The generating function method can be general - ized to bipartite graphs ( see Newman , Strogatz , and Watts , 2001 ) , and it results in a nonvanishing clustering coefﬁcient inherent to the bipartite structure , C 5 1 1 1 ~ m 2 2 m 1 ! ~ n 2 2 n 1 ! 2 m 1 n 1 ~ 2 n 1 2 3 n 2 1 n 3 ! , ( 65 ) where m n 5 ( k k n P a ( k ) and n n 5 ( k k n P m ( k ) . In the actor - movie framework , P a ( k ) represents the fraction of actors who appeared in k movies , while P m ( k ) means the fraction of movies in which k actors have appeared . The prediction of Eq . ( 65 ) has been tested for several collaboration graphs ( Newman , Strogatz , and Watts , 2001 ) . In some cases there is excellent agreement , but in others it deviates by a factor of 2 from the clustering coefﬁcient of the real network . Consequently we can conclude that the order present in real networks is not due solely to the deﬁnition of the network , but an as yet unknown organizing principle . VI . SMALL - WORLD NETWORKS In Secs . II and III . A we saw ( Table I , Figs . 8 and 9 ) that real - world networks have a small - world character like random graphs , but they have unusually large clus - tering coefﬁcients . Furthermore , as Fig . 9 demonstrates , the clustering coefﬁcient appears to be independent of the network size . This latter property is characteristic of ordered lattices , whose clustering coefﬁcient is size inde - pendent and depends only on the coordination number . For example , in a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions ( i . e . , a ring of nodes ) , in which each node is connected to the K nodes closest to it ( see Fig . 15 ) , most of the immediate neighbors of any site are also neighbors of one another , i . e . , the lattice is clustered . For such a lattice the clustering coefﬁcient is C 5 3 ~ K 2 2 ! 4 ~ K 2 1 ! , ( 66 ) which converges to 3 / 4 in the limit of large K . Such low - dimensional regular lattices , however , do not have short path lengths : for a d - dimensional hypercubic lat - tice the average node - node distance scales as N 1 / d , which increases much faster with N than the logarithmic increase observed for random and real graphs . The ﬁrst successful attempt to generate graphs with high cluster - ing coefﬁcients and small l is that of Watts and Strogatz ( 1998 ) . A . The Watts - Strogatz model Watts and Strogatz ( 1998 ) proposed a one - parameter model that interpolates between an ordered ﬁnite - dimensional lattice and a random graph . The algorithm behind the model is the following ( Fig . 15 ) : ( 1 ) Start with order : Start with a ring lattice with N nodes in which every node is connected to its ﬁrst K neighbors ( K / 2 on either side ) . In order to have a sparse but connected network at all times , consider N @ K @ ln ( N ) @ 1 . ( 2 ) Randomize : Randomly rewire each edge of the lattice with probability p such that self - connections and duplicate edges are excluded . This process introduces pNK / 2 long - range edges which connect nodes that oth - FIG . 14 . A schematic representation of a bipartite graph , such as the graph of movies and the actors who have appeared in them . In this small graph we have four movies , labeled 1 to 4 , and eleven actors , labeled A to K , with edges joining each movie to the actors in its cast . The bottom ﬁgure shows the one - mode projection of the graph for the eleven actors . After Newman , Strogatz , and Watts ( 2001 ) . FIG . 15 . The random rewiring procedure of the Watts - Strogatz model , which interpolates between a regular ring lattice and a random network without altering the number of nodes or edges . We start with N 5 20 nodes , each connected to its four nearest neighbors . For p 5 0 the original ring is unchanged ; as p increases the network becomes increasingly disordered until for p 5 1 all edges are rewired randomly . After Watts and Stro - gatz , 1998 . 67 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 erwise would be part of different neighborhoods . By varying p one can closely monitor the transition be - tween order ( p 5 0 ) and randomness ( p 5 1 ) . This model has its roots in social systems in which most people are friends with their immediate neighbors—neighbors on the same street , colleagues , people their friends introduce them to . However , every - body has one or two friends who are a long way away— people in other countries , old acquaintances—who are represented by the long - range edges obtained by rewir - ing in the Watts - Strogatz model . To understand the coexistence of small path length and clustering , we study the behavior of the clustering coefﬁcient C ( p ) and the average path length l ( p ) as a function of the rewiring probability p . For a ring lattice l ( 0 ) . N / 2 K @ 1 and C ( 0 ) . 3 / 4 ; thus l scales linearly with the system size , and the clustering coefﬁcient is large . On the other hand , for p ! 1 the model converges to a random graph for which l ( 1 ) ; ln ( N ) / ln ( K ) ; and C ( 1 ) ; K / N ; thus l scales logarithmically with N , and the clustering coefﬁcient decreases with N . These limit - ing cases might suggest that large C is always associated with large l , and small C with small l . On the contrary , Watts and Strogatz ( 1998 ) found that there is a broad interval of p over which l ( p ) is close to l ( 1 ) yet C ( p ) @ C ( 1 ) ( Fig . 16 ) . This regime originates in a rapid drop of l ( p ) for small values of p , while C ( p ) stays almost unchanged , resulting in networks that are clus - tered but have a small characteristic path length . This coexistence of small l and large C is in excellent agree - ment with the characteristics of real networks discussed in Sec . II , prompting many to call such systems small - world networks . B . Properties of small - world networks The pioneering article of Watts and Strogatz started an avalanche of research on the properties of small - world networks and the Watts - Strogatz ( WS ) model . A much - studied variant of the WS model was proposed by Newman and Watts ( 1999a , 1999b ) , in which edges are added between randomly chosen pairs of sites , but no edges are removed from the regular lattice . This model is somewhat easier to analyze than the original Watts - Strogatz model because it does not lead to the formation of isolated clusters , whereas this can happen in the origi - nal model . For sufﬁciently small p and large N this model is equivalent to the WS model . In the following we shall summarize the main results regarding the prop - erties of small - world models . 1 . Average path length As we discussed above , in the Watts - Strogatz model there is a change in the scaling of the characteristic path length l as the fraction p of the rewired edges is in - creased . For small p , l scales linearly with the system size , while for large p the scaling is logarithmic . As dis - cussed by Watts ( 1999 ) and Pandit and Amritkar ( 1999 ) , the origin of the rapid drop in l is the appearance of shortcuts between nodes . Every shortcut , created at ran - dom , is likely to connect widely separated parts of the graph , and thus has a signiﬁcant impact on the charac - teristic path length of the entire graph . Even a relatively low fraction of shortcuts is sufﬁcient to drastically de - crease the average path length , yet locally the network remains highly ordered . An important question regarding the average path length is whether the onset of small - world behavior is dependent on the system size . It was Watts ( 1999 ) who ﬁrst noticed that l does not begin to decrease until p > 2 / NK , guaranteeing the existence of at least one shortcut . This implies that the transition p depends on the system size , or conversely , there exists a p - dependent crossover length ( size ) N * such that if N , N * , l ; N , but if N . N * , l ; ln ( N ) . The concept of the crossover size was introduced by Barthe´le´my and Amaral ( 1999 ) , who conjectured that the characteristic path length scales as ( see Fig . 17 ) l ~ N , p ! ; N * F S N N * D , ( 67 ) where F ~ u ! 5 H u if u ! 1 ln ~ u ! if u @ 1 . ( 68 ) Numerical simulations and analytical arguments ( Bar - rat 1999 ; Barthe´le´my and Amaral , 1999 ; Newman and Watts , 1999a ; Argollo de Menezes et al . , 2000 ; Barrat and Weigt , 2000 ) concluded that the crossover size N * scales with p as N * ; p 2 t , where t 5 1 / d and d is the dimension of the original lattice to which the random edges are added ( Fig . 18 ) . Thus for the original WS model , deﬁned on a circle ( d 5 1 ) , we have t 5 1 , the onset of small - world behavior taking place at the rewir - ing probability p * ; 1 / N . It is now widely accepted that the characteristic path length obeys the general scaling form FIG . 16 . Characteristic path length l ( p ) and clustering coef - ﬁcient C ( p ) for the Watts - Strogatz model . The data are nor - malized by the values l ( 0 ) and C ( 0 ) for a regular lattice . A logarithmic horizontal scale resolves the rapid drop in l ( p ) , corresponding to the onset of the small - world phenomenon . During this drop C ( p ) remains almost constant , indicating that the transition to a small world is almost undetectable at the local level . After Watts and Strogatz , 1998 . 68 R .

( 70 ) Newman , Moore , and Watts ( 2000 ) have calculated the form of the scaling function f ( u ) for the one - dimensional small - world model using a mean - ﬁeld method that is exact for small or large values of u , but not in the regime in which u . 1 , obtaining f ~ u ! 5 4 A u 2 1 4 u tanh 2 1 u A u 2 1 4 u . ( 71 ) They also solved for the complete distribution of path lengths within this mean - ﬁeld approximation . The scaling relation ( 69 ) has been conﬁrmed by exten - sive numerical simulations ( Newman and Watts , 1999a ; Argollo de Menezes et al . , 2000 ) , renormalization - group techniques ( Newman and Watts , 1999a ) , and series ex - pansions ( Newman and Watts , 1999b ) . Equation ( 69 ) tells us that although the average path length in a small - world model appears at ﬁrst glance to depend on three parameters— p , K , and N —it is in fact entirely deter - mined by a single scalar function f ( u ) of a single scalar variable . Note that both the scaling function f ( u ) and the scaling variable u 5 pKN d have simple physical in - terpretations . The variable u is two times the average number of random links ( shortcuts ) on the graph for a given p , and f ( u ) is the average of the fraction by which the distance between two nodes is reduced for a given u . Several attempts have been made to calculate exactly the distribution of path lengths and the average path length l . Dorogovtsev and Mendes ( 2000a ) studied a simpler model that contains a ring lattice with directed edges of length 1 and a central node that is connected with probability p to the nodes of the lattice by undi - rected edges of length 0 . 5 . They calculated exactly the distribution of path lengths for this model , showing that l / N depends only on the scaling variable pN , and the functional form of this dependence is similar to the nu - merically obtained l ( p ) in the WS model . Kulkarni et al . ( 1999 ) calculated the probability P ( m u n ) that two nodes separated by a Euclidian distance n have a path length m . They have shown that the average path length l is simply related to the mean ^ s & and the mean square ^ s 2 & of the shortest distance between two diametrically opposite nodes ( i . e . , separated by the largest Euclidian distance ) , according to l N 5 ^ s & N 2 1 2 ^ s 2 & L ~ N 2 1 ! . ( 72 ) Unfortunately calculating the shortest distance between opposite nodes is just as difﬁcult as determining l di - rectly . 2 . Clustering coefﬁcient In addition to a short average path length , small - world networks have a relatively high clustering coefﬁcient . The WS model displays this duality for a wide range of the rewiring probabilities p . In a regular lattice ( p 5 0 ) the clustering coefﬁcient does not depend on the size of the lattice but only on its topology . As the edges of the network are randomized , the clustering coefﬁcient re - mains close to C ( 0 ) up to relatively large values of p . FIG . 17 .

Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 The dependence of C ( p ) on p can be derived using a slightly different but equivalent deﬁnition of C , intro - duced by Barrat and Weigt ( 2000 ) . According to this deﬁnition , C 8 ( p ) is the fraction between the mean num - ber of edges between the neighbors of a node and the mean number of possible edges between those neigh - bors . In a more graphic formulation ( Newman , Strogatz , and Watts , 2001 ) , C 8 5 3 3 number of triangles number of connected triples . ( 73 ) Here triangles are trios of nodes in which each node is connected to both of the others , and connected triples are trios in which at least one is connected to both oth - ers , the factor 3 accounting for the fact that each triangle contributes to three connected triples . This deﬁnition corresponds to the concept of the ‘‘fraction of transitive triples’’ used in sociology ( see Wasserman and Faust , 1994 ) . To calculate C 8 ( p ) for the WS model , let us start with a regular lattice with a clustering coefﬁcient C ( 0 ) . For p . 0 , two neighbors of a node i that were connected at p 5 0 are still neighbors of i and connected by an edge with probability ( 1 2 p ) 3 , since there are three edges that need to remain intact . Consequently C 8 ( p ) . C ( 0 ) ( 1 2 p ) 3 . Barrat and Weigt ( 2000 ) have veriﬁed that the deviation of C ( p ) from this expression is small and goes to zero as N ! ‘ . The corresponding expres - sion for the Newman - Watts model is ( Newman , 2001e ) C 8 ~ p ! 5 3 K ~ K 2 1 ! 2 K ~ 2 K 2 1 ! 1 8 pK 2 1 4 p 2 K 2 . ( 74 ) 3 . Degree distribution In the WS model for p 5 0 each node has the same degree K . Thus the degree distribution is a delta func - tion centered at K . A nonzero p introduces disorder in the network , broadening the degree distribution while maintaining the average degree equal to K . Since only a single end of every edge is rewired ( pNK / 2 edges in total ) , each node has at least K / 2 edges after the rewir - ing process . Consequently for K . 2 there are no isolated nodes and the network is usually connected , unlike a random graph which consists of isolated clusters for a wide range of connection probabilities . For p . 0 , the degree k i of a vertex i can be written as ( Barrat and Weigt , 2000 ) k i 5 K / 2 1 c i , where c i can be divided into two parts : c i 1 < K / 2 edges have been left in place ( with probability 1 2 p ) , while c i 2 5 c i 2 c i 1 edges have been rewired towards i , each with probability 1 / N . The probability distributions of c i 1 and c i 2 are P 1 ~ c i 1 ! 5 C K / 2 c i 1 ~ 1 2 p ! c i 1 p K / 2 2 c i 1 ( 75 ) and P 2 ~ c i 2 ! 5 C pNK / 2 c i 2 S 1 N D c i 2 S 1 2 1 N D pNK / 2 2 c i 2 . ~ pK / 2 ! c i 2 c i 2 ! e 2 pK / 2 ( 76 ) for large N . Combining these two factors , the degree distribution follows P ~ k ! 5 ( n 5 0 f ( k , K ) C K / 2 n ~ 1 2 p ! n p K / 2 2 n ~ pK / 2 ! k 2 K / 2 2 n ~ k 2 K / 2 2 n ! ! e 2 pK / 2 ( 77 ) for k > K / 2 , where f ( k , K ) 5 min ( k 2 K / 2 , K / 2 ) . The shape of the degree distribution is similar to that of a random graph . It has a pronounced peak at ^ k & 5 K and decays exponentially for large k ( Fig . 19 ) . Thus the topology of the network is relatively homogeneous , all nodes having approximately the same number of edges . 4 . Spectral properties As discussed in Sec . III . G , the spectral density r ( l ) of a graph reveals important information about its topol - ogy . Speciﬁcally , we have seen that for large random graphs r ( l ) converges to a semicircle . It comes as no surprise that the spectrum of the Watts - Strogatz model depends on the rewiring probability p ( Farkas et al . , 2001 ) . For p 5 0 the network is regular and periodical ; consequently r ( l ) contains numerous singularities [ Fig . 20 ( a ) ] . For intermediate values of p these singularities become blurred , but r ( l ) retains a strong skewness [ Figs . 20 ( b ) and ( c ) ] . Finally , as p ! 1 , r ( l ) approaches the semicircle law characterizing random graphs [ Fig . 20 ( d ) ] . While the details of the spectral density change considerably with p , the third moment of r ( l ) is con - sistently high , indicating a high number of triangles in the network . Thus the results summarized in Fig . 20 al - low us to conclude that a high number of triangles is a basic property of the WS model ( see also Gleis et al . , 2000 ) . The high regularity of small - world models for a FIG . 19 . Degree distribution of the Watts - Strogatz model for K 5 3 and various p .

VII . SCALE - FREE NETWORKS The empirical results discussed in Sec . II demonstrate that many large networks are scale free , that is , their degree distribution follows a power law for large k . Fur - thermore , even for those networks for which P ( k ) has an exponential tail , the degree distribution signiﬁcantly deviates from a Poisson distribution . We have seen in Secs . III . D and VI . B . 3 that random - graph theory and the WS model cannot reproduce this feature . While it is straightforward to construct random graphs that have a power - law degree distribution ( Sec . V ) , these construc - tions only postpone an important question : what is the mechanism responsible for the emergence of scale - free networks ? We shall see in this section that answering this question will require a shift from modeling network topology to modeling the network assembly and evolu - tion . While at this point these two approaches do not appear to be particularly distinct , we shall ﬁnd that there is a fundamental difference between the modeling ap - proach we took in random graphs and the small - world models , and the one required to reproduce the power - law degree distribution . While the goal of the former models is to construct a graph with correct topological features , the modeling of scale - free networks will put the emphasis on capturing the network dynamics . That is , the underlying assumption behind evolving or dy - namic networks is that if we capture correctly the pro - cesses that assembled the networks that we see today , then we will obtain their topology correctly as well . Dy - namics takes the driving role , topology being only a by - product of this modeling philosophy . A . The Baraba´si - Albert model The origin of the power - law degree distribution ob - served in networks was ﬁrst addressed by Baraba´si and Albert ( 1999 ) , who argued that the scale - free nature of real networks is rooted in two generic mechanisms shared by many real networks . The network models dis - cussed thus far assume that we start with a ﬁxed number N of vertices that are then randomly connected or re - wired , without modifying N . In contrast , most real - world networks describe open systems that grow by the continuous addition of new nodes . Starting from a small nucleus of nodes , the number of nodes increases throughout the lifetime of the network by the subse - quent addition of new nodes . For example , the World Wide Web grows exponentially in time by the addition of new web pages , and the research literature constantly grows by the publication of new papers . Second , network models discussed so far assume that the probability that two nodes are connected ( or their connection is rewired ) is independent of the nodes’ de - gree , i . e . , new edges are placed randomly . Most real net - works , however , exhibit preferential attachment , such that the likelihood of connecting to a node depends on the node’s degree . For example , a web page will more likely include hyperlinks to popular documents with al - ready high degrees , because such highly connected documents are easy to ﬁnd and thus well known , or a new manuscript is more likely to cite well - known and thus much - cited publications than less - cited and conse - quently less - known papers . These two ingredients , growth and preferential attach - ment , inspired the introduction of the Baraba´si - Albert model , which led for the ﬁrst time to a network with a power - law degree distribution . The algorithm of the Baraba´si - Albert model is the following : ( 1 ) Growth : Starting with a small number ( m 0 ) of nodes , at every time step , we add a new node with m ( < m 0 ) edges that link the new node to m different nodes already present in the system . ( 2 ) Preferential attachment : When choosing the nodes to which the new node connects , we assume that the probability P that a new node will be connected to node i depends on the degree k i of node i , such that P ~ k i ! 5 k i ( j k j . ( 78 ) After t time steps this procedure results in a network with N 5 t 1 m 0 nodes and mt edges . Numerical simula - tions indicated that this network evolves into a scale - invariant state with the probability that a node has k edges following a power law with an exponent g BA 5 3 ( see Fig . 21 ) . The scaling exponent is independent of m , the only parameter in the model . B . Theoretical approaches The dynamical properties of the scale - free model can be addressed using various analytic approaches . The continuum theory proposed by Baraba ´ si and Albert FIG . 20 .

As these methods are often used interchange - ably in the subsequent section , we brieﬂy review each of them . Continuum theory : The continuum approach intro - duced by Baraba´si and Albert ( 1999 ) and Baraba´si , Al - bert , and Jeong ( 1999 ) calculates the time dependence of the degree k i of a given node i . This degree will in - crease every time a new node enters the system and links to node i , the probability of this process being P ( k i ) . Assuming that k i is a continuous real variable , the rate at which k i changes is expected to be propor - tional to P ( k i ) . Consequently k i satisﬁes the dynamical equation ] k i ] t 5 m P ~ k i ! 5 m k i ( j 5 1 N 2 1 k j . ( 79 ) The sum in the denominator goes over all nodes in the system except the newly introduced one ; thus its value is ( j k j 5 2 mt 2 m , leading to ] k i ] t 5 k i 2 t . ( 80 ) The solution of this equation , with the initial condition that every node i at its introduction has k i ( t i ) 5 m , is k i ~ t ! 5 m S t t i D b with b 5 1 2 . ( 81 ) Equation ( 81 ) indicates that the degree of all nodes evolves the same way , following a power law , the only difference being the intercept of the power law . Using Eq . ( 81 ) , one can write the probability that a node has a degree k i ( t ) smaller than k , P @ k i ( t ) , k # , as P @ k i ~ t ! , k # 5 P S t i . m 1 / b t k 1 / b D . ( 82 ) Assuming that we add the nodes at equal time intervals to the network , the t i values have a constant probability density P ~ t i ! 5 1 m 0 1 t . ( 83 ) Substituting this into Eq . ( 82 ) we obtain P S t i . m 1 / b t k 1 / b D 5 1 2 m 1 / b t k 1 / b ~ t 1 m 0 ! . ( 84 ) The degree distribution P ( k ) can be obtained using P ~ k ! 5 ] P @ k i ~ t ! , k # ] k 5 2 m 1 / b t m 0 1 t 1 k 1 / b 1 1 , ( 85 ) predicting that asymptotically ( t ! ‘ ) P ~ k ! ; 2 m 1 / b k 2 g with g 5 1 b 1 1 5 3 ( 86 ) being independent of m , in agreement with the numeri - cal results .

Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 As the power law observed for real networks de - scribes systems of rather different sizes , it is expected that a correct model should provide a time - independent degree distribution . Indeed , Eq . ( 85 ) predicts that as - ymptotically the degree distribution of the Baraba´si - Albert model is independent of time ( and subsequently independent of the system size N 5 m 0 1 t ) , indicating that , despite its continuous growth , the network reaches a stationary scale - free state . Furthermore , Eq . ( 85 ) also indicates that the coefﬁcient of the power - law distribu - tion is proportional to m 2 . All these predictions are con - ﬁrmed by numerical simulations ( see Fig . 21 ) . Master - equation approach : The method introduced by Dorogovtsev , Mendes , and Samukhin ( 2000a ; see also Kullmann and Kerte´sz , 2001 ) studies the probability p ( k , t i , t ) that at time t a node i introduced at time t i has a degree k . In the Baraba´si - Albert model , when a new node with m edges enters the system , the degree of node i increases by 1 with a probability m P ( k ) 5 k / 2 t ; other - wise it stays the same . Consequently the master equa - tion governing p ( k , t i , t ) for the Baraba´si - Albert model has the form p ~ k , t i , t 1 1 ! 5 k 2 1 2 t p ~ k 2 1 , t i , t ! 1 S 1 2 k 2 t D p ~ k , t i , t ! . ( 87 ) The degree distribution can be obtained as P ~ k ! 5 lim t ! ‘ S ( t i p ~ k , t i , t ! D Y t . ( 88 ) Equation ( 87 ) implies that P ( k ) is the solution of the recursive equation P ~ k ! 5 H k 2 1 k 1 2 P ~ k 2 1 ! for k > m 1 1 2 / ~ m 1 2 ! for k 5 m , ( 89 ) giving P ~ k ! 5 2 m ~ m 1 1 ! k ~ k 1 1 ! ~ k 1 2 ! , ( 90 ) very close to Eq . ( 86 ) obtained using the continuum theory . Rate - equation approach : The rate - equation approach , introduced by Krapivsky , Redner , and Leyvraz ( 2000 ) , focuses on the average number N k ( t ) of nodes with k edges at time t . When a new node enters the network in the scale - free model , N k ( t ) changes as dN k dt 5 m ~ k 2 1 ! N k 2 1 ~ t ! 2 kN k ~ t ! ( k kN k ~ t ! 1 d k , m . ( 91 ) Here the ﬁrst term accounts for the new edges that con - nect to nodes with k 2 1 edges , thus increasing their de - gree to k . The second term describes the new edges connecting to nodes with k edges turning them into nodes with k 1 1 edges , decreasing the number of nodes with k edges . The third term accounts for the new nodes with m edges . In the asymptotic limit N k ( t ) 5 tP ( k ) and ( k kN k ( t ) 5 2 mt , leading to the same recursive equation ( 89 ) , as predicted by the master - equation approach . The master - equation and rate - equation approaches are completely equivalent and offer the same asymptotic results as the continuum theory . Thus for calculating the scaling behavior of the degree distribution they can be used interchangeably . In addition , these methods , not using a continuum assumption , appear more suitable for obtaining exact results in more challenging network models . C . Limiting cases of the Baraba´si - Albert model The power - law scaling in the Baraba´si - Albert model indicates that growth and preferential attachment play important roles in network development . But are both of them necessary for the emergence of power - law scal - ing ? To address this question , two limiting cases of the Baraba´si - Albert model have been investigated , which contain only one of these two mechanisms ( Baraba´si and Albert , 1999 ; Baraba´si , Albert , and Jeong , 1999 ) . Model A keeps the growing character of the network without preferential attachment . Starting with a small number of nodes ( m 0 ) , at every time step we add a new node with m ( < m 0 ) edges . We assume that the new node connects with equal probability to the nodes al - ready present in the system , i . e . , P ( k i ) 5 1 / ( m 0 1 t 2 1 ) , independent of k i . The continuum theory predicts that k i ( t ) follows a logarithmic time dependence , and for t ! ‘ the degree distribution decays exponentially , following [ Fig . 22 ( a ) ] P ~ k ! 5 e m exp S 2 k m D . ( 92 ) The exponential character of the distribution indicates that the absence of preferential attachment eliminates the scale - free character of the resulting network . Model B starts with N nodes and no edges . At each time step a node is selected randomly and connected with probability P ( k i ) 5 k i / ( j k j to a node i in the sys - tem . Consequently model B eliminates the growth pro - cess , the number of nodes being kept constant during the network evolution . Numerical simulations indicate that while at early times the model exhibits power - law scaling , P ( k ) is not stationary ( Fig . 22 ) . Since N is con - stant and the number of edges increases with time , after T . N 2 time steps the system reaches a state in which all nodes are connected . The time evolution of the individual degrees can be calculated analytically using the continuum theory , indi - cating that k i ~ t ! . 2 N t , ( 93 ) assuming N @ 1 , in agreement with the numerical results [ Fig . 22 ( b ) ] . Since the continuum theory predicts that after a tran - sient period the average degree of all nodes should have the same value given by Eq . ( 93 ) , we expect that the 73 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 degree distribution becomes a Gaussian around its mean value . Indeed , Fig . 22 ( b ) shows that the shape of P ( k ) changes from the initial power law to a Gaussian . Motivated by correlations between stocks in ﬁnancial markets and airline route maps , a prior model incorpo - rating preferential attachment while keeping N constant was independently proposed and studied by Amaral et al . ( 1999 ) . The failure of models A and B to lead to a scale - free distribution indicates that growth and preferential at - tachment are needed simultaneously to reproduce the stationary power - law distribution observed in real net - works . D . Properties of the Baraba´si - Albert model While the Baraba´si - Albert model captures the power - law tail of the degree distribution , it has other properties that may or may not agree with empirical results on real networks . As we discussed in Sec . I , a characteristic fea - ture of real networks is the coexistence of clustering and short path lengths . Thus we need to investigate whether the network generated by the model has a small - world character . 1 . Average path length Figure 23 shows the average path length of a Baraba´si - Albert network with average degree ^ k & 5 4 as a function of the network size N , compared with the average path length of a random graph with the same size and average degree . The ﬁgure indicates that the average path length is smaller in the Baraba´si - Albert network than in a random graph for any N , indicating that the heterogeneous scale - free topology is more efﬁ - cient in bringing the nodes close than is the homoge - neous topology of random graphs . We ﬁnd that the av - erage path length of the Baraba ´ si - Albert network increases approximately logarithmically with N , the best ﬁt following a generalized logarithmic form l 5 A ln ~ N 2 B ! 1 C . ( 94 ) Recent analytical results indicate that there is a double logarithmic correction to the logarithmic N dependence , i . e . , l ; ln ( N ) / lnln ( N ) ( Bolloba´s and Riordan , 2001 ) . In Fig . 23 we also show the prediction of Eq . ( 60 ) for these networks , using the numerically determined num - ber of nearest and next - nearest neighbors . While the ﬁt is good for the random graph , Eq . ( 60 ) systematically underestimates the average path length of the Baraba´si - FIG . 22 .

( 60 ) underlies the fact that the to - pology of the network generated by the Baraba´si - Albert model is different from the topology of a random net - work with power - law degree distribution ( Sec . V ) . The dynamical process that generates the network intro - duces nontrivial correlations that affect all topological properties . 2 . Node degree correlations In random - graph models with arbitrary degree distri - bution ( see Aiello et al . , 2000 and Newman , Strogatz , and Watts , 2001 ) , the node degrees are uncorrelated . Krapivsky and Redner ( 2001 ) have shown that in the Baraba´si - Albert model correlations develop spontane - ously between the degrees of connected nodes . Let us consider all node pairs with degree k and l connected by an edge . Without loss of generality we as - sume that the node with degree k was added later to the system , implying that k , l since , according to Eq . ( 81 ) , older nodes have higher degree than younger ones , and for simplicity we use m 5 1 . Denoting by N kl ( t ) the number of connected pairs of nodes with degree k and l , we have dN kl dt 5 ~ k 2 1 ! N k 2 1 , l 2 kN kl ( k kN ~ k ! 1 ~ l 2 1 ! N k , l 2 1 2 lN kl ( k kN ~ k ! 1 ~ l 2 1 ! N l 2 1 d k 1 . ( 95 ) The ﬁrst term on the right - hand side accounts for the change in N kl due to the addition of an edge to a node of degree k 2 1 or k that is connected to a node of de - gree l . Since the addition of a new edge increases the node’s degree by 1 , the ﬁrst term in the numerator cor - responds to a gain in N kl , while the second corresponds to a loss . The second term on the right - hand side incor - porates the same effects as the ﬁrst applied to the other node . The last term takes into account the possibility that k 5 1 ; thus the edge that is added to the node with degree l 2 1 is the same edge that connects the two nodes . This equation can be transformed into a time - independent recursion relation using the hypotheses ( k kN ( k ) ! 2 t and N kl ( t ) ! tn kl . Solving for n kl we ob - tain n kl 5 4 ~ l 2 1 ! k ~ k 1 1 ! ~ k 1 l ! ~ k 1 l 1 1 ! ~ k 1 l 1 2 ! 1 12 ~ l 2 1 ! k ~ k 1 l 2 1 ! ~ k 1 l ! ~ k 1 l 1 1 ! ~ k 1 l 1 2 ! . ( 96 ) For a network with an arbitrary degree distribution , if the edges are placed randomly , n kl 5 n k n l . The most im - portant feature of the result ( 96 ) is that the joint distri - bution does not factorize , i . e . , n kl (cid:222) n k n l . This indicates the spontaneous appearance of correlations between the degrees of the connected nodes . The only case in which n kl can be simpliﬁed to a factorized expression is when 1 ! k ! l , and n kl becomes n kl . k 2 2 l 2 2 , ( 97 ) but even then it is different from n kl 5 k 2 3 l 2 3 , as ex - pected if correlations are absent from the network . This result offers the ﬁrst explicit proof that the dynamical process that creates a scale - free network builds up non - trivial correlations between the nodes that are not present in the uncorrelated models discussed in Sec . V . 3 . Clustering coefﬁcient While the clustering coefﬁcient has been much inves - tigated for the Watts - Strogatz model ( Sec . VI . B . 2 ) , there is no analytical prediction for the Baraba´si - Albert model . Figure 24 shows the clustering coefﬁcient of a Baraba´si - Albert network with average degree ^ k & 5 4 and different sizes , compared with the clustering coefﬁ - cient C rand 5 ^ k & / N of a random graph . We ﬁnd that the clustering coefﬁcient of the scale - free network is about ﬁve times higher than that of the random graph , and this factor slowly increases with the number of nodes . How - ever , the clustering coefﬁcient of the Baraba´si - Albert model decreases with the network size , following ap - proximately a power law C ; N 2 0 . 75 , which , while a slower decay than the C 5 ^ k & N 2 1 decay observed for random graphs , is still different from the behavior of the small - world models , where C is independent of N . 4 . Spectral properties The spectral density of the Baraba´si - Albert model is continuous , but it has a markedly different shape from the semicircular spectral density of random graphs ( Far - kas et al . , 2001 ; Goh , Kahng , and Kim , 2001 ) . Numerical simulations indicate that the bulk of r ( l ) has a triangle - like shape with the top lying well above the semicircle and edges decaying as a power law ( Fig . 25 ) . This power - FIG . 24 .

Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 law decay is due to the eigenvectors localized on the nodes with the highest degree . As in the case of random graphs ( and unlike small - world networks ) , the principal eigenvalue , l 1 , is clearly separated from the bulk of the spectrum . A lower bound for l 1 can be given as the square root of the network’s largest degree k 1 . The node degrees in the Baraba´si - Albert model increase as N 1 / 2 ; hence l 1 increases approximately as N 1 / 4 . Numeri - cal results indicate that l 1 deviates from the expected behavior for small network sizes , reaching it asymptoti - cally for N ! ‘ . This crossover indicates the presence of correlations between the longest row vectors , offering additional evidence for correlations in the Baraba´si - Albert model . The principal eigenvalue plays an important role in the moments of r ( l ) , determining the loop structure of the network . In contrast with the subcritical random graph ( i . e . , p , 1 / N ) , where the fraction of loops be - comes negligible , in a Baraba ´ si - Albert network the frac - tion of loops with more than four edges increases with N , and the growth rate of the loops increases with their size . Note that the fraction of triangles decreases as N ! ‘ ( Bianconi , 2000b ; Gleiss et al . , 2001 ) . While for random graphs r ( l ) follows the semicircle law ( Wigner , 1955 , 1957 , 1958 ) , deriving a similarly simple expression for small - world ( see Sec . VI . B . 4 ) and scale - free networks remains a considerable challenge . VIII . THE THEORY OF EVOLVING NETWORKS The Baraba´si - Albert model discussed in the previous section is a minimal model that captures the mechanisms responsible for the power - law degree distribution . Com - pared to real networks , it has evident limitations : it pre - dicts a power - law degree distribution with a ﬁxed expo - nent , while the exponents measured for real networks vary between 1 and 3 ( see Table II ) . In addition , the degree distribution of real networks can have non - power - law features such as exponential cutoffs ( see Amaral et al . , 2000 ; Jeong , Mason , et al . 2001 ; Newman 2001b , 2001c ) or saturation for small k . These discrep - ancies between the model and real networks led to a surge of interest in addressing several basic questions of network evolution : How can we change the scaling ex - ponents ? Are there universality classes similar to those seen in critical phenomena , characterized by unique ex - ponents ? How do various microscopic processes , known to be present in real networks , inﬂuence the network topology ? Are there quantities beyond the degree distri - bution that could help in classifying networks ? While the community is still in the process of answering these questions , several robust results are already available . These results signal the emergence of a self - consistent theory of evolving networks , offering unprecedented in - sights into network evolution and topology . A . Preferential attachment P ( k ) A central ingredient of all models aiming to generate scale - free networks is preferential attachment , i . e . , the assumption that the likelihood of receiving new edges increases with the node’s degree . The Baraba´si - Albert model assumes that the probability P ( k ) that a node attaches to node i is proportional to the degree k of node i [ see Eq . ( 78 ) ] . This assumption involves two hy - potheses : ﬁrst , that P ( k ) depends on k , in contrast to random graphs in which P ( k ) 5 p , and second , that the functional form of P ( k ) is linear in k . The precise form of P ( k ) is more than a purely academic question , as recent studies have demonstrated that the degree distri - bution depends strongly on P ( k ) . To review these de - velopments we start by discussing the empirical results on the functional form of P ( k ) , followed by the theo - retical work predicting the effect of P ( k ) on the net - work topology . 1 . Measuring P ( k ) for real networks The functional form of P ( k ) can be determined for networks for which we know the time at which each node joined the network ( Jeong , Ne´da , and Baraba´si , 2001 ; Newman 2001d ; Pastor - Satorras et al . , 2001 ) . Such dynamical data are available for the co - authorship net - work of researchers , the citation network of articles , the actor collaboration network , and the Internet at the do - main level ( see Sec . II ) . Consider the state of the network at a given time , and record the number of ‘‘old’’ nodes present in the net - work and their degrees . Next measure the increase in the degree of the ‘‘old’’ nodes over a time interval D T , much shorter than the age of the network . Then , accord - ing to Eq . ( 78 ) , plotting the relative increase D k i / D k as a function of the earlier degree k i for every node gives the P ( k ) function . Here D k is the number of edges FIG . 25 . Rescaled spectral density of three Baraba´si - Albert networks having m 5 m 0 5 5 and various sizes N : solid line , N 5 100 ; long - dashed line , N 5 300 ; short - dashed line , N 5 1000 . The semicircle law corresponding to random graphs is drawn for comparison . The isolated peak corresponds to the largest eigenvalue , which increases as N 1 / 4 . Inset : the edge of the spec - tral density decays as a power law . After Farkas et al . ( 2001 ) . 76 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 added to the network in the time D T . We can reduce ﬂuctuations in the data by plotting the cumulative distri - bution k ~ k ! 5 ( k i 5 0 k P ~ k i ! . ( 98 ) As Fig . 26 shows , the obtained P ( k ) supports the ex - istence of preferential attachment . Furthermore , it ap - pears that in each case P ( k ) follows a power law , i . e . , P ~ k ! ; k a . ( 99 ) In some cases , such as the Internet ( Jeong , Ne´da , and Baraba´si , 2001 ; Pastor - Satorras et al . , 2001 ) , the citation network ( Jeong , Ne´da , and Baraba´si , 2001 ) , Medline , and the Los Alamos archive ( Newman , 2001d ) we have a . 1 , i . e . , P ( k ) depends linearly on k as assumed in the Baraba´si - Albert model . For other networks the depen - dence is sublinear , with a 5 0 . 8 6 0 . 1 for the neuroscience co - authorship and the actor collaboration networks ( Jeong , Ne´da , and Baraba´si , 2001 ) . 2 . Nonlinear preferential attachment The effect of a nonlinear P ( k ) on the network dy - namics and topology was explained by Krapivsky , Red - ner , and Leyvraz ( 2000 ) . Replacing linear preferential attachment [ Eq . ( 78 ) ] with Eq . ( 99 ) in a directed net - work model , Krapivsky , Redner , and Leyvraz calculate the average number N k ( t ) of nodes with k 2 1 incoming edges at time t by the rate - equation approach ( see Sec . VII . B ) . The time evolution of N k ( t ) follows dN k dt 5 1 M a @ ~ k 2 1 ! a N k 2 1 2 k a N k # 1 d k 1 , ( 100 ) where M a ( t ) 5 ( k a N k ( t ) is the a th moment of N k ( t ) . In Eq . ( 100 ) the ﬁrst term accounts for new nodes that connect to nodes with k 2 1 edges , thus increasing their degree to k . The second term describes new nodes con - necting to nodes with k edges , turning them into nodes with k 1 1 edges and hence decreasing the number of nodes with k edges . The third term accounts for the con - tinuous introduction of new nodes with a single outgoing edge . Depending on the value of a , distinct phases have been identiﬁed : ( a ) Sublinear case ( a , 1 ) : In this regime in the long - time limit M a ( t ) satisﬁes M a ( t ) 5 m t , with a pre - factor 1 < m 5 m ( a ) < 2 . Substituting M a ( t ) and N k into Eq . ( 100 ) , we obtain the degree distribution P ~ k ! 5 m k a ) j 5 1 k S 1 1 m j a D 2 1 . ( 101 ) This product can be expanded in series , and the result is a stretch exponential in which a new term arises whenever a decreases below 1 / l , where l is an arbitrary positive integer . ( b ) Superlinear preferential attachment ( a . 1 ) : In this regime Eq . ( 100 ) has no analytical solution , but its discretized version can be used to determine recur - sively the leading behavior of each N k as t ! ‘ . For a . 2 a ‘‘winner - takes - all’’ phenomenon emerges , such that almost all nodes have a single edge , con - necting them to a ‘‘gel’’ node that has the rest of the edges of the network . For 3 / 2 , a , 2 the num - ber of nodes with two edges grows as t 2 2 a , while the number of nodes with more than two edges is again ﬁnite . Again , the rest of the edges belong to the gel node . In general for ( l 1 1 ) / l , a , l / ( l 2 1 ) the number of nodes with more than l edges is ﬁ - nite even in inﬁnite systems , while N k ; t k 2 ( k 2 1 ) a for k < l . In conclusion , the analytical calculations of Krapivsky , Redner , and Leyvraz demonstrate that the scale - free na - ture of the network is destroyed for nonlinear preferen - tial attachment . The only case in which the topology of the network is scale free is that in which the preferential attachment is asymptotically linear , i . e . , P ( k i ) ; a ‘ k i as k i ! ‘ . In this case the rate equation leads to P ~ k ! ; k 2 g with g 5 1 1 m a ‘ . ( 102 ) This way the exponent of the degree distribution can be tuned to any value between 2 and ‘ . 3 . Initial attractiveness Another general feature of P ( k ) in real networks is that P ( 0 ) (cid:222) 0 , i . e . , there is a nonzero probability that a FIG . 26 . Cumulative preferential attachment for ( a ) the cita - tion network ; ( b ) the Internet ; ( c ) the neuroscience scientiﬁc collaboration network ; ( d ) the actor collaboration network . In all panels the dashed line corresponds to linear preferential attachment , and the solid line to no preferential attachment . After Jeong , Ne´da , and Baraba´si ( 2001 ) . 77 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 new node attaches to an isolated node ( Jeong , Ne´da , and Baraba´si , 2001 ) . Thus in general P ( k ) has the form P ~ k ! 5 A 1 k a , ( 103 ) where A is the initial attractiveness of the node i ( Dor - ogovtsev , Mendes , and Samukhin , 2000a ) . Indeed , if A 5 0 , a node that has k 5 0 can never increase its connec - tivity according to Eq . ( 78 ) . However , in real networks every node has a ﬁnite chance to be ‘‘discovered’’ and linked to , even if it has no edges to start with . Thus the parameter A describes the likelihood that an isolated node will be discovered , such as a new article’s being cited the ﬁrst time . Dorogovtsev , Mendes , and Samukhin ( 2000a ) gave an exact solution for a class of growing network models using the master - equation approach ( see Sec . VII . B ) . In their model at every time step a new node is added to the network , followed by the addition of m directed edges pointing from any node in the network to prefer - entially chosen nodes . The probability that a node will receive an incoming edge is proportional to the sum of an initial attractiveness and the number of incoming edges , i . e . , P ( k in ) 5 A 1 k in . The calculations indicate that the degree distribution follows P ( k ) ; k 2 g with g 5 2 1 A / m . Consequently initial attractiveness does not destroy the scale - free nature of the degree distribution ; it only changes the degree exponent . These results agree with the conclusion of Krapivsky , Redner , and Leyvraz ( 2000 ) , who ﬁnd that the power law P ( k ) is preserved for a shifted linear P ( k ) , since the effect of the initial attractiveness diminishes as k ! ‘ . A generalization of the Dorogovtsev - Mendes - Samukhin model ( Dorogovt - sev , Mendes , and Samukhin , 2000b ) allows for the ran - dom distribution of n r edges and an initial degree n of every new node . These changes do not modify the as - ymptotically linear scaling of the preferential attach - ment ; thus this model also gives a power - law degree dis - tribution with g 5 2 1 ( n r 1 n 1 A ) / m . B . Growth In the Baraba´si - Albert model the number of nodes and edges increases linearly in time , and consequently the average degree of the network is constant . In this section we discuss the effect of nonlinear growth rates on the network dynamics and topology . 1 . Empirical results The ability of networks to follow different growth pat - terns is supported by several recent measurements . For example , the average degree of the Internet in Novem - ber of 1997 was 3 . 42 , but it increased to 3 . 96 by Decem - ber of 1998 ( Faloutsos et al . , 1999 ) . Similarly , the World Wide Web has increased its average degree from 7 . 22 to 7 . 86 in the ﬁve months between the measurements of Broder et al . ( 2000 ) . The average degree of the co - authorship network of scientists has been found to con - tinuously increase over an eight - year period ( Baraba´si et al . , 2001 ) . Finally , comparison of metabolic networks of organisms of different sizes indicates that the average degree of the substrates increases approximately linearly with the number of substrates involved in the metabo - lism ( Jeong et al . , 2000 ) . The increase of the average de - gree indicates that in many real systems the number of edges increases faster than the number of nodes , sup - porting the presence of a phenomenon called accelerated growth . 2 . Analytical results Dorogovtsev and Mendes ( 2001a ) studied analytically the effect of accelerated growth on the degree distribu - tion , generalizing the directed model with the asymptoti - cally linear preferential attachment of Dorogovtsev , Mendes , and Samukhin ( 2000a ; see also Sec . VIII . A ) . In this model , at every step a new node is added to the network , which receives n incoming edges from random nodes in the system . Additionally c 0 t u new edges are distributed , each of them being directed from a ran - domly selected node to a node with high incoming de - gree , with asymptotically linear preferential attachment P ( k in ) } A 1 k in . The authors show that accelerated growth , controlled by the exponent u , does not change the scale - free nature of the degree distribution , but it modiﬁes the degree exponent , which now becomes g 5 1 1 1 1 1 u . ( 104 ) While the model of Dorogovtsev and Mendes ( 2001a ) is based on a directed network , Baraba´si et al . ( 2001 ) discuss an undirected model motivated by measure - ments on the evolution of the co - authorship network . In the model new nodes are added to the system with a constant rate , and these new nodes connect to b nodes already in the system with preferential attachment P i 5 b k i ( j k j . ( 105 ) Additionally , at every time step a linearly increasing number of edges ( constituting a fraction a of the nodes that are present in the network ) are distributed between the nodes , the probability that an edge is added between nodes i and j being P ij 5 k i k j ( 8 s , l k s k l N ~ t ! a . ( 106 ) Here N ( t ) is the number of nodes in the system and the summation goes over all nonequal values of s and l . As a result of these two processes the average degree of the network increases linearly in time , following ^ k & 5 at 1 2 b , in agreement with the measurements on the real co - author network . The continuum theory predicts that the time - dependent degree distribution displays a crossover at a critical degree , k c 5 A b 2 t ~ 2 1 2 at / b ! 3 / 2 , ( 107 ) 78 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 such that for k ! k c , P ( k ) follows a power law with ex - ponent g 5 1 . 5 and for k @ k c the exponent is g 5 3 . This result explains the fast - decaying tail of the degree distri - butions measured by Newman ( 2001a ) , and it indicates that as time increases the scaling behavior with g 5 1 . 5 becomes increasingly visible . An equivalent model , pro - posed by Dorogovtsev and Mendes ( 2001c ) , was able to reproduce the two separate power - law regimes in the distribution of word combinations ( Ferrer i Cancho and Sole´ , 2001 ) . C . Local events The Baraba´si - Albert model incorporates only one mechanism for network growth : the addition of new nodes that connect to the nodes already in the system . In real systems , however , a series of microscopic events shape the network evolution , including the addition or rewiring of new edges or the removal of nodes or edges . Lately several models have been proposed to investigate the effect of selected processes on the scale - free nature of the degree distribution , offering a more realistic de - scription of various real networks . Any local change in the network topology can be obtained through a combi - nation of four elementary processes : addition or re - moval of a node and addition or removal of an edge . But in reality these events come jointly ; for example , the rewiring of an edge is a combination of an edge removal and addition . Next we brieﬂy review several studies that address in general terms the effects of local events on network topology . 1 . Internal edges and rewiring A model that incorporates new edges between exist - ing nodes and the rewiring of edges was discussed by Albert and Baraba´si ( 2000 ) . Starting with m 0 isolated nodes , at each time step we perform one of the following three operations : ( i ) With probability p we add m ( m < m 0 ) new edges . One end of a new edge is selected randomly , the other with probability P ~ k i ! 5 k i 1 1 ( j ~ k j 1 1 ! . ( 108 ) ( ii ) With probability q we rewire m edges . For this we randomly select a node i and remove an edge l ij connected to it , replacing it with a new edge l ij 8 that connects i with node j 8 chosen with probabil - ity P ( k j 8 ) given by Eq . ( 108 ) . ( iii ) With probability 1 2 p 2 q we add a new node . The new node has m new edges that with prob - ability P ( k i ) are connected to nodes i already present in the system . In the continuum theory the growth rate of the degree of a node i is given by ] k i ] t 5 ~ p 2 q ! m 1 N 1 m k i 1 1 ( j ~ k j 1 1 ! . ( 109 ) The ﬁrst term on the right - hand side corresponds to the random selection of node i as a starting point of a new edge ( with probability p ) or as the end point from which an edge is disconnected ( with probability q ) . The second term corresponds to the selection of node i as an end point of an edge with the preferential attachment present in all three of the possible processes . The solution of Eq . ( 109 ) has the form k i ~ t ! 5 @ A ~ p , q , m ! 1 m 1 1 # S t t i D 1 / B ( p , q , m ) 2 A ~ p , q , m ! 2 1 , ( 110 ) where A ~ p , q , m ! 5 ~ p 2 q ! S 2 m ~ 1 2 q ! 1 2 p 2 q 1 1 D , B ~ p , q , m ! 5 2 m ~ 1 2 q ! 1 1 2 p 2 q m . ( 111 ) The corresponding degree distribution has the gener - alized power - law form P ~ k ! } @ k 1 k ~ p , q , m ! # 2 g ( p , q , m ) , ( 112 ) where k ( p , q , m ) 5 A ( p , q , m ) 1 1 and g ( p , q , m ) 5 B ( p , q , m ) 1 1 . Equation ( 112 ) is valid only when A ( p , q , m ) 1 m 1 1 . 0 , which , for ﬁxed p and m , translates into q , q max 5 min $ 1 2 p , ( 1 2 p 1 m ) / ( 1 1 2 m ) % . Thus the ( p , q ) phase diagram separates into two regions : For q , q max the de - gree distribution is given by Eq . ( 112 ) , following a gen - eralized power law . For q . q max , however , Eq . ( 112 ) is not valid , but numerical simulations indicate that P ( k ) approaches an exponential . While a power - law tail is present in any point of the scale - free regime , for small k the probability saturates at P @ k ( p , q , m ) # , a feature seen in many real networks [ Figs . 3 ( b ) and ( d ) ] . In addition , the exponent g ( p , q , m ) characterizing the tail of P ( k ) for k @ k ( p , q ) changes continuously with p , q , and m , predicting a range of exponents between 2 and ‘ . The realistic nature of P ( k ) was conﬁrmed by successfully ﬁtting it to the degree dis - tribution of the actor collaboration network ( Albert and Baraba´si , 2000 ) . 2 . Internal edges and edge removal Dorogovtsev and Mendes ( 2000c ) consider a class of undirected models in which new edges are added be - tween old sites and existing edges can be removed . In the ﬁrst variant of the model , called a developing net - work , c new edges are introduced at every time step , which connect two unconnected nodes i and j with a probability proportional to the product of their degrees [ as in Eq . ( 106 ) ] , an assumption conﬁrmed by empirical measurements on the co - authorship network ( Baraba ´ si 79 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 et al . , 2001 ) . It is assumed that c can be tuned continu - ously , such that c . 0 for a developing and c , 0 for a decaying network . The continuum theory predicts that the rate of change of the node degrees has the form ] k i ] t 5 k i ~ t ! E 0 t k j ~ t ! dt j 1 2 c k i ~ t ! F E 0 t k j ~ t ! dt j 2 k i ~ t ! G F E 0 t k j ~ t ! dt j G 2 2 E 0 t k j 2 ~ t ! dt j , ( 113 ) where the summation over all nodes ( j k j has been ap - proximated by an integral over all introduction times t j . The ﬁrst term on the right - hand side incorporates linear preferential attachment , while the second term corre - sponds to the addition of c new edges . Every node can be at either end of the new edge , and the probability of a node i becoming an end of the new edge is propor - tional to the product of its degree k i and the sum of the degrees k j of all other nodes . The normalization factor is the sum of all products k i k j with i different from j . In the asymptotic limit the second term can be ne - glected compared with the ﬁrst term in both the numera - tor and denominator , and Eq . ( 113 ) becomes ] k i ] t 5 ~ 1 1 2 c ! k i ~ t ! E 0 t k j ~ t ! dt j , ( 114 ) which predicts the dynamic exponent ( 81 ) as b 5 1 1 2 c 2 ~ 1 1 c ! ( 115 ) and the degree exponent as g 5 2 1 1 1 1 2 c . ( 116 ) The limiting cases of this developing network are c 5 0 when the familiar Baraba´si - Albert values b 5 1 / 2 and g 5 3 are obtained , and c ! ‘ , when b ! 1 and g ! 2 . In the decaying network at every time step u c u edges are removed randomly . The decrease in the node de - grees due to this process is proportional to their current value , so Eq . ( 114 ) applies here as well , the only differ - ence being that now c , 0 . A more rigorous calculation accounting for the fact that only existing edges can be removed conﬁrms that the end result is identical with Eqs . ( 115 ) and ( 116 ) , only with negative c . The limiting value of c is 2 1 , since the rate of removal of edges cannot be higher than the rate of addition of new nodes and edges , leading to the limit exponents b ! 2 ‘ and g ! ‘ . D . Growth constraints For many real networks the nodes have a ﬁnite life - time ( for example , in social networks ) or a ﬁnite edge capacity ( Internet routers or nodes in the electrical power grid ) . Recently several groups have addressed the degree to which such constraints affect the degree distri - bution . 1 . Aging and cost Amaral et al . ( 2000 ) suggested that while several net - works do show deviations from the power - law behavior , they are far from being random networks . For example , the degree distribution of the electric power grid of southern California and of the neural network of the worm C . elegans is more consistent with a single - scale exponential distribution . Other networks , like the ex - tended actor collaboration network , in which TV ﬁlms and series are included , have a degree distribution in which power - law scaling is followed by an exponential cutoff for large k . In all these examples there are con - straints limiting the addition of new edges . For example , the actors have a ﬁnite active period during which they are able to collect new edges , while for the electrical power grid or neural networks there are constraints on the total number of edges a particular node can have , driven by economic , physical , or evolutionary reasons . Amaral et al . propose that in order to explain these de - viations from a pure power law we need to incorporate FIG . 27 . Deviation from a power law of the degree distribu - tion due to adding ( a ) age and ( b ) capacity constraints to the Baraba´si - Albert model . The constraints result in cutoffs of the power - law scaling . After Amaral et al . ( 2000 ) . 80 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 aging and cost or capacity constraints . The model stud - ied by them evolves following growth and preferential attachment , but when a node reaches a certain age ( ag - ing ) or has more than a critical number of edges ( capac - ity constraints ) , new edges cannot connect to it . In both cases numerical simulations indicate that while for small k the degree distribution still follows a power law , for large k an exponential cutoff develops ( Fig . 27 ) . 2 . Gradual aging Dorogovtsev and Mendes ( 2000b ) propose that in some systems the probability that a new node connects to a node i is not only proportional to the degree k i of node i , but it also depends on its age , decaying as ( t 2 t i ) 2 n , where n is a tunable parameter . Papers or actors gradually lose their ability to attract more edges , the model assuming that this phaseout follows a power law . The calculations predict that the degree distribution de - pends on the exponent n : power - law scaling is present only for n , 1 , and the degree exponent depends on n ( Fig . 28 ) . Moreover , when n . 1 power - law scaling com - pletely disappears , the degree distribution approaching an exponential . E . Competition in evolving networks The Baraba´si - Albert model assumes that all nodes in - crease their degree following a power - law time depen - dence with the same dynamic exponent b 5 1 / 2 [ Eq . ( 81 ) ] . As a consequence , the oldest nodes have the high - est number of edges , since they had the longest lifetime to accumulate them . However , numerous examples indi - cate that in real networks a node’s degree and growth rate do not depend on age alone . For example , on the World Wide Web some documents acquire a large num - ber of edges in a very short time through a combination of good content and marketing ( Adamic and Huberman , 2000 ) , and some research papers acquire many more ci - tations than their peers . Several studies have offered models that address this phenomenon . 1 . Fitness model Bianconi and Baraba´si ( 2001a ) argue that real net - works have a competitive aspect , as each node has an intrinsic ability to compete for edges at the expense of other nodes . They propose a model in which each node is assigned a ﬁtness parameter h i which does not change in time . Thus at every time step a new node j with a ﬁtness h j is added to the system , where h j is chosen from a distribution r ( h ) . Each new node connects with m edges to the nodes already in the network , and the prob - ability of connecting to a node i is proportional to the degree and the ﬁtness of node i , P i 5 h i k i ( j h j k j . ( 117 ) This generalized preferential attachment ensures that even a relatively young node with a few edges can ac - quire edges at a high rate if it has a high ﬁtness param - eter . The continuum theory predicts that the rate of change of the degree of node i is ] k i ] t 5 m h i k i ( k h j k j . ( 118 ) Assuming that the time evolution of k i follows Eq . ( 81 ) with a ﬁtness - dependent b ( h ) , k h i ~ t , t i ! 5 m S t t i D b ( h i ) , ( 119 ) the dynamic exponent satisﬁes FIG . 28 . The dependence of the degree exponent g on the aging exponent n in the model of Dorogovtsev and Mendes ( 2000b ) . The points are obtained from simulations , while the solid line is the prediction of the continuum theory . After Dor - ogovtsev and Mendes ( 2000b ) . FIG . 29 . Time dependence of the degree k h ( t ) , for nodes with ﬁtness h 5 0 . 3 , 0 . 6 , and 0 . 9 . Note that k h ( t ) follows a power law in each case and the dynamic exponent b ( h ) , given by the slope of k ( t ) , increases with h . After Bianconi and Baraba´si ( 2000a ) . 81 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 b ~ h ! 5 h C with C 5 E r ~ h ! h 1 2 b ~ h ! d h . ( 120 ) Thus b is described by a spectrum of values governed by the ﬁtness distribution ( Fig . 29 ) . Equation ( 119 ) indi - cates that nodes with higher ﬁtness increase their degree faster than those with lower ﬁtness . Thus the ﬁtness model allows for late but ﬁt nodes to take a central role in the network topology . The degree distribution of the model is a weighted sum of different power laws , P ~ k ! ; E r ~ h ! C h S m k D C / h 1 1 , ( 121 ) which depends on the choice of the ﬁtness distribution ( see Sec . VIII . G . 2 ) . For example , for a uniform ﬁtness distribution Eq . ( 120 ) gives C 5 1 . 255 and b ( h ) 5 h / 1 . 255 , and the degree distribution is P ~ k ! ; k 2 C 2 1 ln ~ k ! , ( 122 ) i . e . , a power law with a logarithmic correction . The ﬁt - ness model can be extended to incorporate additional processes , such as internal edges , which affect the expo - nents , a problem studied by Ergu¨n and Rodgers ( 2001 ) . 2 . Edge inheritance A different mechanism that gives individuality to the new nodes is proposed by Dorogovtsev , Mendes , and Samukhin ( 2000c ) . They build on the evolving directed - network algorithm introduced in their earlier paper ( Dorogovtsev , Mendes , and Samukhin , 2000a ) , this time assuming that the degree of the new nodes is not con - stant but depends on the state of the network at the time the new node is added to the system . Speciﬁcally , every new node is assumed to be an ‘‘heir’’ of a randomly chosen old node , and it inherits a fraction c of the old node’s incoming edges ( i . e . , a fraction c of the nodes that point to the parent node will also point to the heir ) . The parameter c is assumed to be distributed with a prob - ability density h ( c ) . The time - dependent degree distribution for uniformly distributed c indicates that the fraction of nodes with no incoming edges increases and tends to 1 asymptotically . The distribution of nonzero incoming edges tends to a distribution P ~ k in , k in (cid:222) 0 ! 5 d k in & ln ~ ak in ! , ( 123 ) where d . 0 . 174 and a . 0 . 84 . F . Alternative mechanisms for preferential attachment It is now established that highly connected nodes have better chances of acquiring new edges than their less - connected counterparts . The Baraba´si - Albert model re - ﬂects this fact by incorporating it explicitly through pref - erential attachment ( 78 ) . But where does preferential attachment come from ? We do not yet have a universal answer to this question , and there is a growing suspicion that the mechanisms responsible for preferential attach - ment are system dependent . However , recently several papers have offered promising proposals and models that shed some light on this issue . The unifying theme of these models is that while a preferential attachment is not explicitly introduced , the mechanisms used to place nodes and edges effectively induce one . The diversity of the proposals vividly illustrates the wide range of micro - scopic mechanisms that could effect the evolution of growing networks and still lead to the observed scale - free topologies . 1 . Copying mechanism Motivated by the desire to explain the power - law de - gree distribution of the World Wide Web , Kleinberg et al . ( 1999 ) and Kumar et al . ( 2000a , 2000b ) assume that new Web pages dedicated to a certain topic copy links from existing pages on the same topic . In this model , at each time step a new node is added to the network , which connects to the rest of the nodes with a constant number of directed edges . At the same time a ‘‘proto - type’’ node is chosen randomly from the nodes already in the system . The outgoing edges of the new node are distributed in the following way : with probability p the destination of the i th edge is selected randomly , and with probability 1 2 p it is taken to be the destination of the i th edge of the prototype node . This second process increases the probability of high - degree nodes’ receiving new incoming edges . In fact , since the prototype nodes are selected randomly , the probability that a Web page with degree k will receive a new hyperlink is propor - tional to ( 1 2 p ) k , indicating that the copying mecha - nism effectively amounts to a linear preferential attach - ment . Kumar et al . prove that the expectation of the incoming degree distribution is P ~ k in ! 5 k 2 ( 2 2 p ) / ( 1 2 p ) ; ( 124 ) thus P ( k ) follows a power law with an exponent that varies between 2 ( for p ! 0 ) and ‘ ( for p ! 1 ) . 2 . Edge redirection Although inspired by a different mechanism , the growing network with the redirection model of Krapiv - sky and Redner ( 2001 ) is mathematically equivalent with the model of Kumar et al . ( 2000a , 2000b ) discussed above . In this model at every time step a new node is added to the system and an earlier node i is selected uniformly as a possible target for attachment . With probability 1 2 r a directed edge from the new node to i is created ; however , with probability r the edge is redi - rected to the ancestor node j of node i ( i . e . , the node at which i attached when it was ﬁrst added to the network ) . When the rate - equation approach ( Sec . VII . B ) is ap - plied , the number of nodes N ( k ) with degree k evolves as 82 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 dN ~ k ! dt 5 d k 1 1 1 2 r M 0 ~ N k 2 1 2 N k ! 1 r M 0 @ ~ k 2 2 ! N k 2 1 2 ~ k 2 1 ! N k # . ( 125 ) The ﬁrst term corresponds to nodes that are just added to the network . The second term indicates the random selection of a node to which the new node will attach . This process affects N ( k ) if this node has a degree k 2 1 [ in which case its degree will become k , increasing N ( k ) ] or k [ in which case N ( k ) decreases by one ] . The normalization factor M 0 is the sum of all degrees . The third term corresponds to the rewiring process . Since the initial node is chosen uniformly , if redirection does oc - cur , the probability that a node with k 2 1 preexisting edges will receive the redirected edge is proportional to k 2 2 , the number of preexisting incoming edges . Thus redirection also leads to a linear preferential attach - ment . This rate equation is equivalent with Eq . ( 100 ) with an asymptotically linear attachment P ( k ) ; k 2 2 1 1 / r . Thus this model leads to a power - law degree distribution with degree exponent g 5 1 1 1 / r , which can be tuned to any value larger than 2 . 3 . Walking on a network The walking mechanism proposed by Va´zquez ( 2000 ) was inspired by citation networks . Entering a new ﬁeld , we are usually aware of a few important papers and fol - low the references included in these to ﬁnd other rel - evant articles . This process is continued recursively , such that a manuscript will contain references to papers dis - covered this way . Va´zquez formulates the corresponding network algorithm in the following way : We start with an isolated node . At every time step a new node is added that links with a directed edge to a randomly se - lected node , and then it follows the edges starting from this node and links to their end points with probability p . This last step is repeated starting from the nodes to which connections were established , until no new target node is found . In fact , this algorithm is similar to the breadth - ﬁrst search used in determining the cluster structure of a network , with the exception that not all edges are followed , but only a fraction equal to p . In the special case of p 5 1 one can see that nodes of high de - gree will be more likely to acquire new incoming edges , leading to a preferential attachment P ( k ) 5 ( 1 1 k ) / N . Consequently , the degree distribution follows a power law with g 5 2 . If p varies between 0 and 1 , numerical simulations indicate a phase transition : for p , p c . 0 . 4 the degree distribution decays exponentially , while for p . p c it has a power - law tail with g very close to 2 , the value corresponding to p 5 1 . Thus , while the model does not explicitly include preferential attachment , the mechanism responsible for creation of the edges induces one . 4 . Attaching to edges Perhaps the simplest model of a scale - free network without explicit preferential attachment was proposed by Dorogovtsev , Mendes , and Samukhin ( 2001a ) . In this model at every time step a new node connects to both ends of a randomly selected edge . Consequently the probability that a node will receive a new edge is di - rectly proportional to its degree ; in other words , this model has exactly the same preferential attachment as the Baraba´si - Albert model . It readily follows that the degree distribution has the same asymptotic form as the Baraba´si - Albert model , i . e . , P ( k ) ; k 2 3 . The evolving network models presented in this section attempt to capture the mechanisms that govern the evo - lution of network topology ( see Table III ) , guided by the information contained in the degree distribution . Less is known , however , about the clustering coefﬁcients of these models . Notable exceptions are the models of Baraba´si et al . ( 2001 ; see also Sec . VIII . B ) and Dor - ogovtsev , Mendes , and Samukhin ( 2001a ; see also Sec . VIII . F ) . The clustering coefﬁcient of the model of Bara - ba´si et al . displays a complex behavior as the network increases , ﬁrst decreasing , going through a minimum , then increasing again , while the model of Dorogovtsev , Mendes , and Samukhin ( 2000d ) has a constant asymptotic clustering coefﬁcient . These results suggest that evolving network models can capture the high clus - tering coefﬁcients of real networks . G . Connection to other problems in statistical mechanics The modeling of complex networks has offered fertile ground for statistical mechanics . Indeed , many advances in our understanding of the scaling properties of both small - world and evolving networks have beneﬁted from concepts ranging from critical phenomena to nucleation theory and gelation . On the other hand , there appears to be another close link between statistical mechanics and evolving networks : the continuum theories proposed to predict the degree distribution can be mapped , often ex - actly , onto some well - known problems investigated in statistical physics . In the following we shall discuss two such mappings , relating evolving networks to the Simon model ( Simon , 1955 ; see Amaral et al . , 2000 ; Bornholdt and Ebel , 2001 ) and to a Bose gas ( Bianconi and Bara - ba´si , 2001b ) . 1 . The Simon model Aiming to account for the wide range of empirical distributions following a power law , such as the fre - quency of word occurrences ( Zipf , 1949 ) , the number of articles published by scientists ( Lotka , 1926 ) , the popu - lations of cities ( Zipf , 1949 ) , or the distribution of in - comes ( Pareto , 1898 ) , Simon ( 1955 ) proposed a class of stochastic models that result in a power - law distribution function . The simplest variant of the Simon model , de - scribed in terms of word frequencies , has the following algorithm : Consider a book that is being written and has reached a length of N words . Denote by f N ( i ) the num - ber of different words that each occurred exactly i times in the text . Thus f N ( 1 ) denotes the number of different words that have occurred only once . The text is contin - 83 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 ued by adding a new word . With probability p , this is a new word . However , with probability 1 2 p , this word is already present . In this case Simon assumes that the probability that the ( N 1 1 ) th word has already ap - peared i times is proportional to if N ( i ) , i . e . , the total number of words that have occurred i times . As noticed by Bornholdt and Ebel ( 2001 ) , the Simon model can be mapped exactly onto the following net - work model : Starting from a small seed network , we record the number of nodes that have exactly k incom - ing edges , N k . At every time step one of two processes can happen : TABLE III . Summary of the mechanisms behind the current evolving network models . For each model ( beyond the Baraba´si - Albert model ) we list the concept or mechanism deviating from linear growth and preferential attachment , the two basic ingre - dients of the Baraba´si - Albert model , and the interval in which the exponent g of the degree distribution can vary .

( b ) With probability 1 2 p a directed edge between two existing nodes is added . The starting point of this edge is selected randomly , while its end point is selected such that the probability that a node be - longing to the N k nodes with k incoming edges will be chosen is P ~ class k ! } kN k . ( 126 ) To appreciate the nature of this mapping , we need to clarify several issues : ( 1 ) While Eq . ( 126 ) represents a form of the ‘‘rich - get - richer’’ phenomenon , it does not imply preferential attachment [ Eq . ( 78 ) ] as used in various evolving network models . However , Eq . ( 78 ) implies Eq . ( 126 ) . Thus the Simon model describes a general class of stochastic processes that can result in a power - law distribution , appropriate to capture Pareto and Zipf’s laws . ( 2 ) The interest in evolving network models comes from their ability to describe the topology of complex net - works . The Simon model does not have an underly - ing network structure , as it was designed to describe events whose frequency follows a power law . Thus network measures going beyond the degree distribu - tion , such as the average path length , spectral prop - erties , or clustering coefﬁcient , cannot be obtained from this mapping . ( 3 ) The mapping described above leads to a directed network with internal edges , different from the Baraba´si - Albert model . However , it is close to the model proposed by Dorogovtsev , Mendes , and Sam - ukhin ( 2000a , 2000b ) discussed in Sec . VIII . A . 3 , with the only difference being that here the initial attractiveness is present only for the isolated nodes . Since Eq . ( 126 ) corresponds to an asymptotically linear preferential attachment , a correspondence can be made with the model of Krapivsky , Redner , and Leyvraz ( 2000 ) as well . 2 . Bose - Einstein condensation Bianconi and Baraba´si ( 2001b ) show the existence of a close link between evolving networks and an equilib - rium Bose gas . Starting with the ﬁtness model intro - duced in Sec . VIII . E . 1 , the mapping to a Bose gas can be done by assigning an energy e i to each node , determined by its ﬁtness through the relation e i 52 1 b ln h i , ( 127 ) where b 5 1 / T plays the role of inverse temperature . An edge between two nodes i and j , having energies e i and e j , corresponds to two noninteracting particles , one on each energy level ( see Fig . 30 ) . Adding a new node l to the network corresponds to adding a new energy level e l and 2 m new particles to the system . Half of these par - ticles are deposited on the level e l ( since all new edges start from the new node ) , while the other half are dis - tributed between the energy levels of the end points of the new edges , the probability that a particle lands on level i being given by P i 5 e 2 be i k i ( e 2 be i k i . ( 128 ) The continuum theory predicts that the rate at which particles accumulate on energy level e i is given by ] k i ~ e i , t , t i ! ] t 5 m e 2 be i k i ~ e i , t , t i ! Z t , ( 129 ) where k i ( e i , t , t i ) is the occupation number of level i and Z t is the partition function , deﬁned as Z t 5 ( j 5 1 te 2 be j k j ( e j , t , t j ) . The solution of Eq . ( 129 ) is k i ~ e i , t , t i ! 5 m S t t i D f ( e i ) , ( 130 ) where the dynamic exponent f ( e ) satisﬁes f ( e ) 5 e 2 b ( e 2 m ) , m plays the role of the chemical potential , satisfying the equation FIG . 30 . Fitness and mapping between the network model and the Bose gas : ( a ) On the left we have a network of ﬁve nodes , each characterized by a ﬁtness h i . Equation ( 127 ) assigns an energy e i to each h i ( right ) . An edge from node i to node j corresponds to a particle at level e i and one at e j . The network evolves by adding a new node ( dashed circle , h 6 ) , which con - nects to m 5 2 other nodes ( dashed lines ) , chosen following Eq . ( 78 ) . In the gas this results in the addition of a new energy level ( e 6 , dashed ) populated by m 5 2 new particles ( s ) , and the deposition of m 5 2 other particles to energy levels to which the new node is connected ( e 2 and e 5 ) . ( b ) In the ﬁt - get - rich ( FGR ) phase we have a continuous degree distribu - tion , the several high - degree nodes linking the low - degree nodes together . In the energy diagram this corresponds to a decreasing occupation number with increasing energy . ( c ) In the Bose - Einstein condensate the ﬁttest node attracts a ﬁnite fraction of all edges , corresponding to a highly populated ground level and sparsely populated higher energies . After Bi - anconi and Baraba´si ( 2001b ) . 85 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 E deg ~ e ! 1 e b ( e 2 m ) 2 1 5 1 , ( 131 ) and deg ( e ) is the degeneracy of the energy level e . Equation ( 131 ) suggests that in the t ! ‘ limit the occu - pation number , giving the number of particles with en - ergy e , follows the familiar Bose statistics n ~ e ! 5 1 e b ( e 2 m ) 2 1 . ( 132 ) The existence of the solution ( 130 ) depends on the functional form of the distribution g ( e ) of the energy levels , determined by the r ( h ) ﬁtness distribution ( see Sec . VIII . E . 1 ) . Speciﬁcally , if Eq . ( 131 ) has no non - negative solution for a given g ( e ) and b , we can observe a Bose - Einstein condensation , indicating that a ﬁnite fraction of the particles condens on the lowest energy level [ see Fig . 30 ( c ) ] . This mapping to a Bose gas predicts the existence of two distinct phases as a function of the energy distribu - tion . In the ﬁt - get - rich phase , describing the case of uni - form ﬁtness discussed in Sec . VIII . E . 1 , the ﬁtter nodes acquire edges at a higher rate than older but less ﬁt nodes . In the end the ﬁttest node will have the most edges , but the richest node is not an absolute winner , since its share of the edges ( i . e . , the ratio of its edges and the total number of edges in the network ) decays to zero for large system sizes [ Fig . 30 ( b ) ] . The unexpected out - come of this mapping is the possibility of Bose - Einstein condensation for T , T BE , when the ﬁttest node ac - quires a ﬁnite fraction of the edges and maintains this share of edges over time [ Fig . 30 ( c ) ] . A representative ﬁtness distribution that leads to condensation is r ( h ) 5 ( 1 2 h ) l with l . 1 . The temperature in Eq . ( 127 ) plays the role of a dummy variable , since if we deﬁne a ﬁxed distribution r ( h ) , the existence of Bose - Einstein condensation or the ﬁt - get - rich phase depends only on the functional form of r ( h ) and is independent of b . Indeed , b falls out at the end from all topologically relevant quantities . As Dorogovtsev and Mendes ( 2001b ) have subsequently shown , the existence of Bose - Einstein condensation can be derived directly from the ﬁtness model , without em - ploying the mapping to a Bose gas . While the condensa - tion phenomenon appears to be similar to the gelation process observed by Krapivsky , Redner , and Leyvraz , ( 2000 ) in the case of superlinear preferential attach - ment , it is not clear at this point if this similarity is purely accidental or if there is a deeper connection be - tween the ﬁtness model and the ﬁtness - free superlinear model . IX . ERROR AND ATTACK TOLERANCE Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance for errors ( Albert , Jeong , and Baraba´si , 2000 ) . For example , relatively simple organisms grow , persist , and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or envi - ronmental interventions , an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic and genetic network ( Jeong et al . , 2000 ; Jeong , Mason , et al . , 2001 ) . Complex communication networks display a high degree of robustness : while key components regularly malfunc - tion , local failures rarely lead to loss of the global information - carrying ability of the network . The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of their underlying network struc - ture . But could the network topology , beyond redun - dancy , play a role in the error tolerance of such complex systems ? While error tolerance and robustness almost always have a dynamical component , here we shall focus only on the topological aspects of robustness , caused by edge and / or node removal . The ﬁrst results regarding network reliability when subjected to edge removal came from random - graph theory ( Moore and Shannon , 1956a , 1956b ; Margulis , 1974 ; Bolloba´s , 1985 ) . Consider an ar - bitrary connected graph H N of N nodes , and assume that a p fraction of the edges have been removed . What is the probability that the resulting subgraph is con - nected , and how does it depend on the removal prob - ability p ? For a broad class of starting graphs H N ( Mar - gulis , 1974 ) there exists a threshold probability p c ( N ) such that if p , p c ( N ) the subgraph is connected , but if p . p c ( N ) it is disconnected . This phenomenon is in fact an inverse bond percolation problem deﬁned on a graph , with the slight difference ( already encountered in the evolution of a random graph ) that the critical probabil - ity depends on N . As the removal of a node implies the malfunctioning of all of its edges as well , node removal inﬂicts more damage than edge removal . Does a threshold phenom - enon appear for node removal too ? And to what degree does the topology of the network determine the net - work’s robustness ? In the following we shall call a net - work error tolerant ( or robust ) if it contains a giant clus - ter comprised of most of the nodes even after a fraction of its nodes are removed . The results indicate a strong correlation between robustness and network topology . In particular , scale - free networks are more robust than random networks against random node failures , but are more vulnerable when the most connected nodes are targeted ( Albert , Jeong , and Baraba´si , 2000 ) . A . Numerical results In the ﬁrst study comparing the robustness of the Erdo˝s - Re´nyi random graph and a scale - free network generated by the Baraba´si - Albert model , Albert , Jeong , and Baraba´si ( 2000 ) investigated networks that have the same number of nodes and edges , differing only in the degree distribution . Two types of node removal were considered . Random perturbations can cause the failure of some nodes ; thus the ﬁrst mechanism studied was the removal of randomly selected nodes . The second mecha - nism , in which the most highly connected nodes are re - moved at each step , was selected because it is the most damaging to the integrity of the system . This second choice emulates an intentional attack on the network . 86 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 Let us start from a connected network , and at each time step remove a node . The disappearance of the node implies the removal of all edges that connect to it , dis - rupting some of the paths between the remaining nodes ( Fig . 31 ) . One way to monitor the disruption of an ini - tially connected network is to study the relative size of the largest cluster that remains connected , S , and the average path length l of this cluster , as a function of the fraction f of the nodes removed from the system . We expect that the size of the largest cluster will decrease and its average path length increase as an increasing number of nodes are removed from the network . 1 . Random network , random node removal We start by investigating the response of a random network to the random removal of its nodes [ see Fig . 32 ( a ) , h ] , looking at the changes in the relative size of the largest cluster S ( i . e . , the fraction of nodes contained in the largest cluster ) and its average path length l as an increasing number of nodes are randomly removed . As expected , for a random network , the size S of the largest cluster decreases from S 5 1 as f increases . If only the removed nodes were missing from the largest cluster , S would follow the diagonal corresponding to S 5 1 for f 5 0 and S 5 0 for f 5 1 . While for small f , S follows this line , as f increases the decrease becomes more rapid , indicating that clusters of nodes become isolated from the main cluster . At a critical fraction f c , S drops to 0 , indicating that the network breaks into tiny isolated clusters . These numerical results indicate an inverse per - colation transition . Indeed , percolation theory can be used to calculate the critical fraction f c ( Sec . IX . B ) . The behavior of the average path length l also con - ﬁrms this percolationlike transition : it starts from a value characteristic of an unperturbed random graph , in - creases with f as paths are disrupted in the network , and peaks at f c [ Fig . 32 ( c ) , ﬁlled squares ] . After the network breaks into isolated clusters , l decreases as well , since in this regime the size of the largest cluster decreases very rapidly . When f is small we can use the prediction of random - graph theory , Eq . ( 16 ) , indicating that l scales as ln ( SN ) / ln ( ^ k & ) , where ^ k & is the average degree of the largest cluster ( Sec . IV . G ) . Since the number of edges decreases more rapidly than the number of nodes during node removal ( the disruption of each node inducing the disruption of several edges ) , ^ k & decreases faster with increasing f than SN , and consequently l increases . However , for f . f c the prediction of percolation theory becomes valid , and Eq . ( 44 ) indicates that l no longer depends on ^ k & and decreases with S . 2 . Scale - free network , random node removal While a random network undergoes an inverse perco - lation transition when a critical fraction of its nodes are randomly removed , the situation is dramatically differ - ent for a Baraba´si - Albert network [ Figs . 32 ( b ) and ( d ) , square datapoints ] . Simulations indicate that while the size of the largest cluster decreases , it reaches 0 at a higher f . At the same time , l increases much more slowly than in the random case , and its peak is much less prominent . The behavior of the system still suggests a percolation transition , but analytical calculations indi - cate that this is merely a ﬁnite size effect , and f c ! 1 for a scale - free network as the size of the network increases ( Sec . IX . B ) . In simple terms , scale - free networks display an exceptional robustness against random node failures . 3 . Preferential node removal In the case of an intentional attack , when the nodes with the highest number of edges are targeted , the net - work breaks down faster than in the case of random node removal . The general breakdown scenario again follows an inverse percolation transition , but now the critical fraction is much lower than in the random case . FIG . 31 . Illustration of the effects of node removal on an ini - tially connected network . In the unperturbed state the distance between nodes A and B is 2 , but after two nodes are removed from the system , it increases to 6 . At the same time the net - work breaks into ﬁve isolated clusters . FIG . 32 .

After Albert , Jeong , and Baraba´si ( 2000 ) . 87 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 This is understandable , since at every step the highest possible number of edges are removed from the system . Again , the two network topologies respond differently to attacks ( Fig . 32 , circular datapoints ) : the scale - free network , due to its reliance on the highly connected nodes , breaks down earlier than the random network . In conclusion , numerical simulations indicate that scale - free networks display a topological robustness against random node failures . The origin of this error tolerance lies in their heterogeneous topology : low - degree nodes are far more abundant than nodes with high degree , so random node selection will more likely affect the nodes that play a marginal role in the overall network topology . But the same heterogeneity makes scale - free networks fragile to intentional attacks , since the removal of the highly connected nodes has a dra - matic disruptive effect on the network . B . Error tolerance : analytical results The ﬁrst analytical approach to calculating the critical threshold for fragmentation , f c , of a network under ran - dom node failures was developed by Cohen et al . ( 2000 ) . An alternative approach was proposed independently by Callaway et al . ( 2000 ) . Cohen et al . ( 2000 ) argue that for a random network with a given degree distribution , f c can be determined using the following criterion : a giant cluster , with size proportional to the size of the original network , exists if an arbitrary node i , connected to a node j in the giant cluster , is also connected to at least one other node . If i is connected only to j , the network is fragmented . If we assume that loops can be neglected ( true for large fragmented systems ) and use the Baye - sian rules for conditional probabilities ( see Cohen et al . , 2000 ) , this criterion can be written as ^ k 2 & ^ k & 5 2 . ( 133 ) Consider a node with initial degree k 0 chosen from an initial distribution P ( k 0 ) . After the random removal of a fraction f of the nodes , the probability that the degree of that node becomes k is C k 0 k ( 1 2 f ) k f k 0 2 k , and the new degree distribution is P ~ k ! 5 ( k 0 5 k ‘ P ~ k 0 ! C k 0 k ~ 1 2 f ! k f k 0 2 k . ( 134 ) Thus the average degree and its second moment for the new system follows ^ k & 5 ^ k 0 & ( 1 2 f ) and ^ k 2 & 5 ^ k 02 & ( 1 2 f ) 2 1 ^ k 0 & f ( 1 2 f ) , allowing us to rewrite the criterion ( 133 ) for criticality as f c 5 1 2 1 ^ k 02 & ^ k 0 & 2 1 , ( 135 ) where f c is the critical fraction of removed nodes and ^ k 02 & , ^ k 0 & are computed from the original distribution before the node removal . As a test of the applicability of Eq . ( 133 ) , let us re - move a fraction f of the nodes from a random graph . Since in the original graph k 0 5 pN and k 02 5 ( pN ) 2 1 pN ( see Sec . III . C ) , Eq . ( 135 ) implies that f c 5 1 2 1 / ( pN ) . If in the original system ^ k 02 & / ^ k 0 & 5 2 , mean - ing that pN 5 ^ k & 5 1 ( the familiar condition for the ap - pearance of the giant cluster in a random graph ) , the above equation indicates that f c 5 0 , i . e . , any amount of node removal leads to the network’s fragmentation . The higher the original degree ^ k 0 & of the network , the larger the damage it can survive without breaking apart . The critical probability is rather different for a scale - free networks . If the degree distribution follows a power law P ~ k ! 5 ck 2 g , k 5 m , m 1 1 , . . . , K , ( 136 ) where m and K . mN 1 / g 2 1 are the smallest and the larg - est degree values , respectively , using a continuum ap - proximation valid in the limit K @ m @ 1 , we obtain ^ k 02 & ^ k 0 & ! u 2 2 g u u 3 2 g u 3 H m if g . 3 m g 2 2 K 3 2 g if 2 , g , 3 K if 1 , g , 2 . ( 137 ) We can see that for g . 3 the ratio is ﬁnite and there is a transition at f c 5 1 2 1 g 2 2 g 2 3 m 2 1 ( 138 ) ( see Fig . 33 ) . However , for g , 3 Eq . ( 137 ) indicates that the ratio diverges with K . For example , in the case 2 , g , 3 , f c 5 1 2 1 g 2 2 3 2 g m g 2 2 K 3 2 g 2 1 ( 139 ) ( Fig . 33 ) , and thus f c ! 1 when N ! ‘ , true also for g , 2 . This result implies that inﬁnite systems with g , 3 do not break down under random failures , as a spanning FIG . 33 . The fraction of nodes in a giant cluster S as a function of the fraction of randomly removed nodes for scale - free ran - dom networks with g 5 3 . 5 ( 3 ) and g 5 2 . 5 ( s , h , n ) . In the latter case three different system sizes were used , with corre - sponding largest degree values K : s , K 5 25 ; h , K 5 100 ; n , K 5 400 . The different curves illustrate that the fragmentation transition exists only for ﬁnite networks , while f c ! 1 as N ! ‘ . After Cohen et al . ( 2000 ) . 88 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 cluster exists for arbitrarily large f . In ﬁnite systems a transition is observed , although the transition threshold is very high . This result is in agreement with the numeri - cal results discussed in the previous subsection ( Albert , Jeong , and Baraba´si , 2000 ) indicating a delayed and very small peak in the l curve for the failure of the Baraba´si - Albert model ( having g 5 3 ) . Callaway et al . ( 2000 ) investigate percolation on gen - eralized random networks , considering that the occupa - tion probability of nodes is coupled to the node degree . The authors use the method of generating functions dis - cussed in Sec . V . B and generalize it to include the prob - ability of occupancy of a certain node . The generating function for the degree distribution , corresponding to Eq . ( 46 ) in Sec . V . B , becomes F 0 ~ x ! 5 ( k 5 0 ‘ P ~ k ! q k x k , ( 140 ) where q k stands for the probability that a node with degree k is present . The overall fraction of nodes that are present in the network is q 5 F 0 ( 1 ) , which is also equal to 1 2 f where f is the fraction of nodes missing from the system . This formulation includes the random occupancy ( or conversely , random failure ) case as the special case of uniform occupation probability q k 5 q . The authors consider random networks with a trun - cated power - law degree distribution P ~ k ! 5 H 0 for k 5 0 Ck 2 g e 2 k / k for k > 1 . ( 141 ) The exponential cutoff of this distribution has the role of regularizing the calculations in the same way as the larg - est degree K in the study of Cohen et al . ( 2000 ) . In the case of uniform occupation probability q corre - sponding to the random breakdown of a fraction f 5 1 2 q of the nodes , the critical occupation probability fol - lows q c 5 1 2 f c 5 1 Li g 2 2 ~ e 2 1 / k ! Li g 2 1 ~ e 2 1 / k ! 2 1 . ( 142 ) Here Li n ( x ) is the n th polylogarithm of x , deﬁned as Li n ( x ) 5 ( k 5 1 ‘ x k / k n . This expression is similar to Eqs . ( 138 ) and ( 139 ) derived by Cohen et al . ( 2000 ) . In the case of inﬁnite network size we can take k ! ‘ , and the expression for the critical occupation probability be - comes q c 5 1 z ~ g 2 2 ! z ~ g 2 1 ! 2 1 , ( 143 ) where z ( x ) is the Riemann z function deﬁned in the region x . 1 ; thus this expression is valid only for g . 3 . Since z ( x ) ! ‘ as x ! 1 , q c becomes zero as g ap - proaches 3 , indicating that for inﬁnite scale - free net - works even inﬁnitesimal occupation probabilities can ensure the presence of an inﬁnite cluster . C . Attack tolerance : Analytical results In the general framework of Callaway et al . ( 2000 ) , an intentional attack targeting the nodes with the highest degree is equivalent to setting q k 5 u ~ k max 2 k ! 5 H 1 if k < k max 0 if k . k max . ( 144 ) This way only the nodes with degree k < k max are occu - pied , which is equivalent to removing all nodes with k . k max . The number of removed nodes can be increased by lowering the value of k max . Callaway et al . ( 2000 ) cal - culate the fraction of nodes in the largest cluster S as a function of f and k max ( Fig . 34 ) . This ﬁgure is in agree - ment with the results of Albert , Jeong , and Baraba´si ( 2000 ) indicating that scale - free networks become frag - mented after a small fraction f c of highly connected nodes is removed . It also indicates that a small percent - age of the most highly connected nodes can contain nodes with surprisingly low degree , agreeing also with the ﬁnding of Broder et al . ( 2000 ) that the World Wide Web is resilient to the removal of all nodes with degree higher than 5 . The theoretical framework of Cohen et al . ( 2000 ) can also be extended to the case of intentional attack on a scale - free network with degree distribution ( 136 ) ( Co - hen et al . , 2001 ) . Under attack two things happen : ( a ) the cutoff degree K is reduced to a new value K ˜ , K , and ( b ) the degree distribution of the remaining nodes is changed . The new cutoff can be estimated from the re - lation ( k 5 K ˜ K P ~ k ! 5 ( k 5 K ˜ ‘ P ~ k ! 2 1 N 5 f , ( 145 ) which for large N implies K ˜ 5 mf 1 / ( 1 2 g ) . ( 146 ) FIG . 34 . Fraction of nodes in a spanning cluster in a scale - free random network with all nodes of degree greater than k max unoccupied : s , g 5 2 . 4 , h , g 5 2 . 7 ; n , g 5 3 . 0 . The solid lines are the analytical prediction . Upper frame : as a function of f . Lower frame : as a function of the cutoff k max . After Callaway et al . ( 2000 ) . 89 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 The removal of a fraction f of the most connected nodes results in a random removal of a fraction f ˜ of edges from the remaining nodes . The probability that an edge leads to a deleted node equals the fraction of edges belonging to deleted nodes , f ˜ 5 ( k 5 K ˜ K kP ~ k ! ^ k 0 & 5 f ( 2 2 g ) / ( 1 2 g ) , ( 147 ) for g . 2 . We can see that in the limit g ! 2 any nonzero f will lead to f ˜ ! 1 and thus to the breakdown of the whole network . Even in a ﬁnite network , where the up - per cutoff of Eq . ( 145 ) is K . N , in the limit g 5 2 , f ˜ 5 ln ( Nf / m ) , thus very small f values can lead to the de - struction of a large fraction of the edges . Since for random node deletion the probability of an edge’s leading to a deleted node equals the fraction of deleted nodes , Cohen et al . ( 2001 ) argue that the net - work after undergoing an attack is equivalent to a scale - free network with cutoff K ˜ that has undergone random removal of a fraction f ˜ of its nodes . Replacing f with f ˜ and K with K ˜ in Eq . ( 135 ) , we obtain the following equation for K ˜ : S K ˜ m D 2 2 g 2 2 5 2 2 g 3 2 g m F S K ˜ m D 3 2 g 2 1 G . ( 148 ) This equation can be solved numerically to obtain K ˜ as a function of m and g , and f c ( m , g ) can then be de - termined from Eq . ( 146 ) . The results indicate that a breakdown phase transition exists for g . 2 , and f c is very small for all g values , on the order of a few percent . An interesting feature of the f c ( g ) curve is that it has a maximum around g 5 2 . 25 . It is not surprising that smaller g values lead to increased vulnerability to at - tacks due to the special role the highly connected nodes play in connecting the system . However , Cohen et al . ( 2001 ) argue that the cause of the increased susceptibil - ity of high g networks is that for these even the original network is formed by several independent clusters , and the size of the largest cluster decreases with increasing g . Indeed , the results of Aiello , Chung , and Lu ( 2000 ; see also Sec . V ) indicate that for 2 , g , 3 . 478 the original network contains an inﬁnite cluster and several smaller clusters of size at most ln N , and for g . 3 . 478 the origi - nal network has no inﬁnite cluster . D . The robustness of real networks Systematic studies of the error and attack tolerance of real networks are available for three systems highly rel - evant to science and technology . 1 . Communication networks The error and attack tolerance of the Internet and the World Wide Web was investigated by Albert , Jeong , and Baraba ´ si ( 2000 ) . Of the two networks , the Internet’s ro - bustness has more practical signiﬁcance , as about 0 . 3 % of the routers regularly malfunction ( random errors ) , and the Internet is occasionally subject to hacker attacks targeting some of the most connected nodes . The re - sults , based on the latest map of the Internet topology at the interdomain ( autonomous system ) level , indicate that the average path length on the Internet is unaf - fected by the random removal of as many as 60 % of the nodes , while if the most connected nodes are eliminated ( attack ) , l peaks at a very small f [ Fig . 35 ( a ) ] . Similarly , the large connected cluster persists for high rates of ran - dom node removal , but if nodes are removed in the at - tack mode , the size of the fragments that break off in - creases rapidly , the critical point appearing at a very small threshold , f c I . 0 . 03 [ Fig . 35 ( c ) ] . The World Wide Web study was limited to a subset of the web containing 325 729 nodes , the sample investi - gated in Albert , Jeong , and Baraba´si ( 1999 ) . As the World Wide Web is directed , not all nodes can be reached from all nodes , even for the starting network . To resolve this problem , only distances between nodes that had a path between them were included in the av - erage distance between nodes . Second , directed net - works cannot be separated into clusters unambiguously : two nodes can be seen as part of the same cluster when starting from a certain node , yet they appear to be in separate clusters when starting from another . Hence the number of independent clusters was ambiguous , but the largest cluster could still be determined . Third , when simulating an attack on the World Wide Web , the nodes with the highest number of outgoing edges were re - moved , since k out can be readily obtained by looking at a web document , while k in can only be determined from FIG . 35 . The relative size S ( a ) , ( b ) and average path length l ( c ) , ( d ) of the largest cluster in two communication networks when a fraction f of the nodes are removed : ( a ) , ( c ) Internet at the domain level , N 5 6209 , ^ k & 5 3 . 93 ; ( b ) , ( d ) subset of the World Wide Web ( WWW ) with N 5 325 729 and ^ k & 5 4 . 59 . h , random node removal ; s , preferential removal of the most connected nodes . After Albert , Jeong , and Baraba´si ( 2000 ) . 90 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 a map of the whole web . Despite these methodological differences , the response of the World Wide Web is simi - lar to that of the undirected networks : after a slight ini - tial increase , l remains constant in the case of random failures [ Fig . 35 ( b ) ] , while it increases for attacks . The network survives as a large cluster under high rates of failure , but under attack the system abruptly falls apart at f cw 5 0 . 067 [ Fig . 35 ( d ) ] . 2 . Cellular networks Cellular networks can be subject to random errors as a result of mutations or protein misfolding , as well as harsh external conditions eliminating essential metabo - lites . Jeong et al . ( 2000 ) studied the responses of the metabolic networks of several organisms to random and preferential node removal . Removing up to 8 % of the substrates , they found that the average path length did not increase when nodes were removed randomly , but it increased rapidly upon removal of the most - connected nodes , attaining a 500 % increase with the removal of only 8 % of the nodes . Similar results have been ob - tained for the protein network of yeast as well ( Jeong , Mason , et al . , 2001 ; see also Vogelstein , Lane , and Le - vine 2000 ) . 3 . Ecological networks As a result of human actions or environmental changes , species are deleted from food webs , an issue of major concern for ecology and environmental science . Sole´ and Montoya ( 2001 ) studied the response of the food webs discussed in Sec . II to the removal of species ( nodes ; Montoya and Sole´ , 2000 ) . The authors measured the relative size S of the largest cluster , the average size ^ s & of the rest of the species clusters , and the fraction of species becoming isolated due to the removal of other species on whom their survival depended ( secondary ex - tinctions ) . The results indicate that random species re - moval causes the fraction of species contained in the largest cluster to decrease linearly . At the same time the values of ^ s & remain 0 or 1 , and the secondary extinction rates remain very low ( smaller than 0 . 1 ) even when a high fraction of the nodes is removed . The estimate of Eq . ( 135 ) for the critical fraction at which the network fragments gives f cfail values around 0 . 95 for all networks , indicating that these networks are error tolerant . How - ever , when the most connected ( keystone ) species are successively removed , S decays quickly and becomes zero at f cattack . 0 . 2 , while ^ s & peaks . The secondary ex - tinctions increase dramatically , reaching 1 at relatively low values of f ( f . 0 . 16 for the Silwood Park web ) . The results presented in this section offer a simple but compelling picture : scale - free networks display a high degree of robustness against random errors , coupled with a susceptibility to attacks . This double feature is the result of the heterogeneity of the network topology , en - coded by the power - law degree distribution . While we focused on two measures only , S and l , it is likely that most network measures will show distinct behavior for scale - free and random networks . The types of disturbances we considered were static , that is , the removal of a node affected other nodes only in the topological sense . However , in many networks there is a dynamical aspect to error tolerance : the re - moval of a node could affect the functionality of other nodes as well . For example , the removal of a highly con - nected router on the Internet will redirect trafﬁc to other routers that may not have the capacity to handle the increased trafﬁc , creating an effective denial of ser - vice . Thus in many systems errors lead to cascading fail - ures , affecting a large fraction of the network . While little is known about such events , Watts ( 2000 ) has re - cently shown that the network topology makes a big dif - ference under cascading failures as well . He investigated a binary model in which the state of a node changed from off to on if a threshold fraction of its neighbors were on . In this model the probability that a perturba - tion in an initially all - off state will spread to the entire network can be connected to the existence of a giant cluster of vulnerable nodes . Using the method of gener - ating functions , Watts ( 2000 ) showed that scale - free ran - dom graphs are much less vulnerable to random pertur - bations than are Erdo˝s - Re´nyi random graphs with the same average degree . It is often assumed that the robustness of many com - plex systems is rooted in their redundancy , which for networks represents the existence of many alternative paths that can preserve communication between nodes even if some nodes are absent . We are not aware of any research that would attempt to address this issue in quantitative terms , uncovering the degree to which re - dundancy plays a role . X . OUTLOOK The ﬁeld of complex networks is rapidly evolving . While the potential for new and important discoveries is high , the ﬁeld has attained a degree of coherence that made a review necessary and appropriate . The fact that the obtained results have reached a critical mass is best illustrated by the amount of work that had to be omitted from this review for lack of space . Being forced to make a choice , we focused on the mechanisms and models that describe network topology . In the following we brieﬂy discuss some results that could not be covered in this approach but that are important for the ﬁeld . In many ways work in these areas is as important as the work covered so far . A . Dynamical processes on networks Most networks offer support for various dynamical processes , and often the topology plays a crucial role in determining the system’s dynamical features . The range of possible dynamical processes is wide . Watts ( 1999 ) studied the impact of clustering on several processes , including games , cooperation , the Prisoner’s Dilemma , cellular automata , and synchronization ( see also Lago - Ferna ´ ndez et al . , 2001 ) . Wang and Chen ( 2001 ) have shown that the inhomogeneous scale - free topology plays 91 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 an important role in determining synchronization in a complex network , but search and random walks in com - plex networks is also a much investigated topic ( Huber - man et al . , 1998 ; Kleinberg , 2000 ; Adamic et al . , 2001 ; Bilke and Peterson , 2001 ; Burda et al . , 2001 ; Walsh , 2001 ) . Modeling dynamics on a ﬁxed topology is legiti - mate when the time scales describing the network topol - ogy and the dynamical process superposed to the net - work differ widely . A good example is Internet trafﬁc , whose modeling requires time resolutions from millisec - onds up to a day ( Crovella and Bestavros , 1997 ; Will - inger et al . , 1997 ; Sole´ and Valverde , 2001 ) , compared with the months required for signiﬁcant topological changes . Similarly , within a cell the concentrations of different chemicals change much faster than the cellular network topology ( Savageau , 1998 ; Schilling and Pals - son , 1998 ; Elowitz and Leibler , 2000 ; Gardner et al . , 2000 ) , which is shaped by evolution over many genera - tions . The network structure plays a crucial role in deter - mining the spread of ideas , innovations , or computer vi - ruses ( Coleman , Menzel , and Katz , 1957 ; Valente , 1995 ) . In this light , spreading and diffusion has been studied on several types of networks regular ( Kauffman , 1993 ; Keeling , 1999 ) , random ( Solomonoff and Rapoport , 1951 ; Rapoport , 1957 ; Weigt and Hartmann , 2001 ) , small - world ( Moukarzel , 1999 ; Newman and Watts , 1999a , 1999b ; Moore and Newman , 2000a , 2000b ; New - man , Moore , and Watts , 2000 ; Kuperman and Abram - son , 2001 ) , and scale - free ( Johansen and Sornette , 2000 ; Bilke and Peterson , 2001 ; Tadic´ , 2001b ; Watts , 2000 ) . A particularly surprising result was offered recently by Pastor - Satorras and Vespignani ( 2001a , 2001b ) , who studied the effect of network topology on the spead of disease . They showed that while for random networks a local infection spreads to the whole network only if the spreading rate is larger than a critical value l c , for scale - free networks any spreading rate leads to the infection of the whole network . That is , for scale - free networks the critical spreading rate reduces to zero , a highly un - expected result that goes against volumes of particles written on this topic . When the time scales governing the dynamics on the network are comparable to that characterizing the net - work assembly , the dynamical processes can inﬂuence the topological evolution . This appears to be the case in various biological models inspired by the evolution of communities or the emergence of the cellular topology ( Slanina and Kotrla , 1999 , 2000 ; Bornholdt and Sneppen , 2000 ; Hornquist , 2001 ; Jain and Krishna , 2001 ; La¨ssig et al . , 2001 ) . In the current models these systems are often not allowed to ‘‘grow , ’’ but they exist in a sta - tionary state that gives room for diverse network topolo - gies ( Slanina and Kotrla , 1999 , 2000 ) . Interestingly , these models do not lead to scale - free networks in the station - ary state , although it is known that cellular networks are scale free ( Jeong et al . , 2000 ; Wagner and Fell , 2000 ; Jeong , Mason , et al . , 2001 ) . Thus it is an open challenge to design evolutionary models that , based on selection or optimization mechanisms , could produce topologies similar to those seen in the real world . In general , when it comes to understanding the dy - namics of networks , as well as the coupling between the dynamics and network assembly , we are only at the be - ginning of a promising journey ( Strogatz , 2001 ) . So far we lack simple organizing principles that would match the coherence and universality characterizing network topology . Due to the importance of the problem and the rapid advances we have witnessed in describing network topology , we foresee it as being a rapidly growing area . B . Directed networks Many important networks , including the World Wide Web or metabolic networks , have directed edges . In di - rected networks , however , not all nodes can be reached from a given node . This leads to a fragmented cluster structure in which the clusters are not unique , but de - pend on the starting point of the inquiry . Beyond some general aspects , little is known about such directed net - works , but important insights could emerge in the near future . A promising step in this direction is the empirical study of the cluster structure of the World Wide Web ( Broder et al . , 2000 ) , ﬁnding that the web can be parti - tioned into several qualitatively different domains . The results indicate that 28 % of the nodes are part of the strongly connected component , in which any pair of nodes is connected by paths in either direction . Another 23 % of the nodes can be reached from the strongly con - nected component but cannot connect to it in the other direction , while a roughly equal fraction of the nodes have paths leading to the strongly connected component but cannot be reached from it . As several groups have pointed out , this structure is not speciﬁc to the World Wide Web but is common to all directed networks , rang - ing from cell metabolism to citation networks ( Newman , Strogatz , and Watts , 2000 ; Dorogovtsev , Mendes , and Samukhin , 2001b ) . Most network models ( including small - world and evolving networks ) ignore the network’s directedness . However , as the World Wide Web measurements have shown , incoming and outgoing edges could follow differ - ent scaling laws . In this respect , the Baraba´si - Albert model ( Baraba´si and Albert , 1999 ) explains only the in - coming degree distribution , as , due to its construction , each node has exactly m outgoing edges ; thus the out - going degree distribution is a delta function ( Sec . VII . A ) . While several models have recently investigated directed evolving networks , obtaining a power law for both outgoing and incoming edges ( Krapivsky , Rodgers , and Redner , 2001 ; Tadic´ , 2001a , 2001b ) . The generic fea - tures of such complex directed models could hold fur - ther surprises . C . Weighted networks , optimization , allometric scaling Many real networks are weighted networks , in con - trast with the binary networks investigated so far , in which the edge weights can have only two values 0 and 1 92 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 ( absent or present ) . Indeed , in social networks it is often important to assign a strength to each acquaintance edge , indicating how well the two individuals know each other ( Newman , 2001b , 2001c ) . Similarly , cellular net - works are characterized by reaction rates , and the edges on the Internet by bandwidth . What are the mechanisms that determine these weights ? Do they obey nontrivial scaling behavior ? To what degree are they determined by the network topology ? Most answers to these ques - tions come from two directions : theoretical biology and ecology , concerned with issues related to allometric scal - ing , and random resistor networks ( Derrida and Vanni - menus , 1982 ; Duxbury , Beale , and Moukarzel , 1995 ) , a topic much studied in statistical mechanics . Allometric scaling describes the transport of material through the underlying network characterizing various biological systems . Most of these systems have a branching , tree - like topology . The combination of the tree topology with the desire to minimize the cost of transportation leads to nontrivial scaling in the weights of the edges ( West et al . , 1997 ; Enquist et al . , 1998 , 1999 ) . In a more general context , Banavar and collaborators have shown that when the aim is to minimize the cost of transportation , the optimal network topology can vary widely , ranging from treelike structures to spirals or loop - dominated highly interconnected networks ( Bana - var et al . , 1999 , 2000 ) . Beyond giving systematic methods and principles to predict the topology of transportation networks , these studies raise some important questions that need to be addressed in the future . For example , to what degree is the network topology shaped by global optimization , or the local processes seen in scale - free networks ? There are fundamental differences between transportation and evolving networks . In transportation models the network topology is determined by a global optimization process , in which edges are positioned to minimize , over the whole network , some predeﬁned quantity , such as cost or energy of transportation . In contrast , for evolving networks such global optimization is absent , as the decision about where to link is del - egated to the node level . However , this decision is not entirely local in scale - free networks either , as the node has information about the degree of all nodes in the network , from which it chooses one following Eq . ( 78 ) , the normalization factor making the system fully coupled . The interplay between such local and global optimization processes is far from being fully under - stood ( Carlson and Doyle , 1999 , 2000 ; Doyle and Carl - son , 2000 ) . While edge weights are well understood for trees and some much - studied physical networks , ranging from river networks ( Banavar et al . , 1997 ; Rodrı´guez - Iturbe and Rinaldo , 1997 ) to random resistor networks ( Der - rida and Vannimenus , 1982 ; Duxbury , Beale , and Moukarzel , 1995 ) , little work has been done on these problems in the case of small - world or scale - free net - works . Recently Yook et al . ( 2001 ) have investigated an evolving network model in which the weights were added dynamically , resulting in unexpected scaling be - havior . Newman ( 2001b ) has also assigned weights to characterize the collaboration strength between scien - tists . These studies make an important point , however : despite the practical relevance and potential phenom - enological richness , the understanding of weighted net - works is still in its infancy . D . Internet and World Wide Web A few real networks , with high technological or intel - lectual importance , have received special attention . In these studies the goal is to develop models that go be - yond the basic growth mechanisms and incorporate the speciﬁc and often unique details of a given system . Along these lines much attention has focused on devel - oping realistic World Wide Web models that explain ev - erything from the average path length to incoming and outgoing degree distribution ( Adamic and Huberman , 1999 ; Flake et al . , 2000 ; Krapivsky , Rodgers , and Redner , 2001 ; Tadic´ , 2001a ) . Many studies focus on the identiﬁ - cation of web communities as well , representing clusters of nodes that are highly connected to each other ( Gib - son et al . , 1998 ; Adamic and Adar , 2000 ; Flake et al . , 2000 ; Pennock et al . , 2000 ) . There is a race in computer science to create good Internet topology generators ( Paxson and Floyd , 1997 ; Comellas et al . , 2000 ) . New Internet protocols are tested on model networks before their implementation , and protocol optimization is sensitive to the underlying net - work topology ( Labovitz et al . , 2000 ) . Prompted by the discovery that the Internet is a scale - free network , all topology generators are being reviewed and redesigned . These studies have resulted in careful investigations into what processes could contribute to the correct topology , reafﬁrming that growth and preferential attachment are necessary conditions for realistic Internet models ( Me - dina et al . , 2000 ; Palmer and Steffan , 2000 ; Jeong , Ne´da , and Baraba´si , 2001 ; Pastor - Satorras et al . , 2001 ; Yook , Jeong , and Baraba´si , 2001b ) . In addition , an interesting link has recently been found ( Caldarelli et al . , 2000 ) to river networks , a much - studied topic in statistical me - chanics ( see Banavar et al . , 1999 ; Dodds and Rothman 2000 , 2001a , 2001b , 2001c ) . E . General questions The high interest in scale - free networks might give the impression that all complex networks in nature have power - law degree distributions . As we discussed in Sec . II , that is far from being the case . It is true that several complex networks of high interest for the scientiﬁc com - munity , such as the World Wide Web , cellular networks , the Internet , some social networks , and the citation net - work , are scale free . However , others , such as the power grid or the neural network of C . elegans , appear to be exponential . Does that mean that they are random ? Far from it . These systems are best described as evolving networks . As we have seen in many examples in Sec . VIII , evolving networks can develop both power - law and exponential degree distributions . While the power - law regime appears to be robust , sublinear preferential 93 R . Albert and A . - L . Baraba´si : Statistical mechanics of complex networks Rev . Mod . Phys . , Vol . 74 , No . 1 , January 2002 attachment , aging effects , and growth constraints lead to crossovers to exponential decay . Thus , while evolving networks are rather successful at describing a wide range of systems , the functional form of P ( k ) cannot be guessed until the microscopic details of the network evo - lution are fully understood . If all processes shaping the topology of a certain network are properly incorporated , the resulting P ( k ) often has a rather complex form , de - scribed by a combination of power laws and exponen - tials . In critical phenomena we are accustomed to unique scaling exponents that characterize complex systems . In - deed , the critical exponents are uniquely determined by robust factors , such as the dimension of the space or conservation laws ( Stanley , 1971 ; Ma , 1976 ; Hohenberg and Halperin , 1977 ) . The most studied exponents in terms of evolving networks are the dynamic exponent b and the degree exponent g . While the former character - izes the network dynamics , the latter is a measure of the network topology . The inseparability of the topology and dynamics of evolving networks is shown by the fact that these exponents are related by the scaling relation ( 86 ) ( Dorogovtsev , Mendes , and Samukhin , 2000a ) , un - derlying the fact that a network’s assembly uniquely de - termines its topology . However , in no case are these ex - ponents unique . They can be tuned continuously by such parameters as the frequency of internal edges , rewiring rates , initial node attractiveness , and so on . While it is difﬁcult to search for universality in the value of the exponents , this does not imply that the exponents are not uniquely deﬁned . Indeed , if all processes contribut - ing to the network assembly and evolution are known , the exponents can be calculated exactly . But they do not assume the discrete values we are accustomed to in criti - cal phenomena . Some real networks have an underlying bipartite structure ( Sec . V . D ) . For example , the actor network can be represented as a graph consisting of two types of nodes : actors and movies , the edges always connecting two nodes of different types . These networks can be de - scribed as generalized random graphs ( Newman , Stro - gatz , and Watts , 2001 ) . It is important to note , however , that both subsets of these bipartite graphs are growing in time . While it has not yet been attempted , the theoreti - cal methods developed for evolving networks can be generalized for bipartite networks as well , leading to coupled continuum equations . We expect that extending these methods , whenever appropriate , would lead to a much more realistic description of several real systems . The classical thinking on complex networks , rooted in percolation and random - graph theory ( see Aldous , 1999 ) , is that they appear as a result of a percolation process in which isolated nodes eventually join a giant cluster as the number of edges increases between them . Thus a much - studied question concerns the threshold at which the giant cluster appears . With a few exceptions ( Callaway et al . , 2001 ) , evolving networks do not follow this percolation picture , since they are connected from their construction . Naturally , if node or edge removal is allowed , percolation - type questions do emerge ( Sec . IX ) . F . Conclusions The shift that we have experienced in the past three years in our understanding of networks was swift and unexpected . We have learned through empirical studies , models , and analytic approaches that real networks are far from being random , but display generic organizing principles shared by rather different systems . These ad - vances have created a proliﬁc branch of statistical me - chanics , followed with equal interest by sociologists , bi - ologists , and computer scientists . Our goal here was to summarize , in a coherent fashion , what is known so far . Yet we believe that these results are only the tip of the iceberg . We have uncovered some generic topological and dynamical principles , but the answers to the open questions could hide new concepts and ideas that might turn out to be just as exciting as those we have encoun - tered so far . The future could bring new tools as well , as the recent importation of ideas from ﬁeld theory ( Burda et al . , 2001 ) and quantum statistics ( Bianconi , 2000a , 2001 ; Bianconi and Baraba´si , 2001b ; Zizzi , 2001 ) indi - cates . Consequently this article is intended to be as much a review as a catalyst for further advances . We hope that the latter aspect will dominate .
