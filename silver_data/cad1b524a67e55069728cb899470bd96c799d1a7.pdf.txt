Drubin 1  Rockefeller University Press Introduction The human body consists of hundreds of different isogenic cells in diverse differentiated states , each adapted to carry out a spe - cific function . Previous studies focused largely on gene expres - sion changes that underlie differentiation ( Gifford et al . , 2013 ) and govern cell specification ( Kreitzer et al . , 2013 ) . Here , using clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) as a model , we developed a system to study how cell structures and processes are modified for the specific needs of different cell types during differentiation . CME leads to the internalization of receptor – ligand complexes and nutrients through a multistep pathway involving sequential recruitment of proteins that each perform a different function . At a late stage , the GTPase dynamin is recruited to the neck of the clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) , where it mediates clathrin - coated ves - icle ( CCV ) scission from the plasma membrane ( PM ; McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ; Robinson , 2015 ) . Over the last decade , growing evidence suggested that the timing of endocytic protein recruit - ment to the PM , as well as the morphology of clathrin - coated structures ( CCSs ) , vary from one cell type to another ( Fujimoto et al . , 2000 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ; Doyon et al . , 2011 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ; Grove et al . , 2014 ) . However , cell line variability caused by cancer mutations and genomic instability , and the practice of overexpressing fluorescent fusion proteins , made it unclear whether differences in CME properties reflected programmed changes that support the new function of the differentiated cell , or reflected a nonphysiological phenotype caused by cell pathol - ogy ( Drubin and Hyman , 2017 ) . Here we developed an isogenic cell system to address such questions and gained new insights into programmed changes that adapt CME for the specific needs of different cell types . Results Endocytic site dynamics and morphology change upon stem cell differentiation Previously , studies of the dynamics and morphology of CME sites were confounded by the fact that different studies used cultured cells derived from different species and tissues , complicating understanding of sources of variation . Additionally , these stud - ies used tissue culture cells derived from cancers , and they used overexpressed fluorescent fusion proteins to investigate protein © 2018 Dambournet et al .

To circumvent these problems , we genome - edited a parent human embryonic stem cell ( hESC ) line to express fluorescent protein fusions of CME proteins at endogenous levels , and differentiated them into different cell types , allowing us to compare CME dynamics and morphology in isogenic cells of distinct differentiated states . We made in - frame fusions of TagRFP - T and EGFP to the genes encoding clathrin light chain A ( CLTA ) and dynamin2 ( DNM2 ) , respectively , using zinc - finger nucleases ( ZFNs ) and CRI SPR / Cas9 , respectively ( Fig . 1 A ) . We determined that both clathrin alleles were successfully targeted , whereas only one DNM2 allele was tagged . Clathrin protein expression levels were similar in the genome - edited hESCs as compared with nonedited parental cells , whereas we observed an ∼ 50 % reduction in dynamin protein lev - els in the edited cells compared with the parental cells ( Fig . 1 D ) . Taking advantage of the pluripotent property of the hESCs , we differentiated them into two cell types , fibroblasts , a cell type derived from the mesoderm , and neuronal progenitor cells ( NPCs ) , a cell type derived from the ectoderm ( Fig . 1 , A and D ) . Next , we quantitatively analyzed CME dynamics in the three cell types by combining total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIR FM ) with automated particle tracking using a two - color association program ( Aguet et al . , 2013 ; Hong et al . , 2015 ) . As dynamin is recruited near the end of the CME pathway and marks release of the vesicle from the PM , only clathrin tracks joined by dynamin were considered to represent bona fide CME events , as opposed to CCVs derived from other membranes and “visiting” the TIR FM field ( Hong et al . , 2015 ) . Our analyses showed dramatic differences in endocytic dynamics between the three cell types . In hESCs , clathrin mostly appeared as diffraction - limited spots that recruited dynamin ( Fig . 1 B and Video 1 ) . Larger , more static struc - tures were less frequent . By comparison , large , apparently static , clathrin structures were more prominent in fibroblasts ( Video 2 ) . Interestingly , although the clathrin structures in the fibroblasts appeared stable , dynamin was repeatedly recruited to their edges , and we observed the apparent formation and release of CCVs from the structures ( arrowhead in Video 2 ) . These observations indicate that these long - lived clathrin Figure 1 . Endocytic dynamics in three isogenic cell types .

In NPCs , however , clathrin and dynamin appeared only as dynamic , discrete colocalized puncta . Their lifetimes—defined as the time the proteins are present on the PM—were significantly shorter . The lifetimes of clathrin and dynamin were 40 ± 1 and 30 ± 1 s , respectively , for NPCs , as compared with 75 ± 2 . 5 and 45 ± 2 , or 65 ± 3 and 50 ± 3 s , in hESCs and fibroblasts , respectively ( mean ± SEM ; Fig . 1 C and Video 3 ) . As a consequence of this highly dynamic , uniform behavior , the productivity , defined as the number of clathrin tracks associated with dynamin per time per area , was much greater in NPCs as compared with hESCs and fibroblasts ( 0 . 05 ± 0 . 005 compared with 0 . 02 ± 0 . 004 and 0 . 01 ± 0 . 002 tracks ⋅ μm −2 ⋅ min −1 , respectively ) . Platinum replica EM of unroofed cells was used to determine the ultrastructure of clathrin at the PM in the three different cell types ( Fig . 2 A ) . We categorized clathrin structures as flat , curved , or spherical , corresponding to the stages of CME , as defined pre - viously ( Sochacki et al . , 2017 ; Fig . 2 A ) . In both the hESCs and NPCs , as expected , we observed mainly spherical structures with a similar size ( Fig . 2 C ) . No flat structures were observed in NPCs . In hESCs , the flat structures were small and likely represent the CCP initiation stage ( Fig . 2 , A – C ) . Of note , EM images revealed a dense actin cortex in both hESCs and NPCs , which might cover some flat structures , causing us to underestimate their occur - rence ( full image of these cells in Figs . S1 and S2 ) . In fibroblasts , the flat and curved clathrin structures were dramatically differ - ent : the curved clathrin structures were about two times larger and asymmetric , and occasionally clustered together ( Fig . 2 , A – D ; and Fig . S3 ) . These interesting structures correlate well with observations in TIR FM , where clathrin appeared first as large structures that gave rise to several smaller structures when DNM2 was recruited . The flat structures were often connected to curved and spherical clathrin structures , as previously observed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts ( Lampe et al . , 2014 ) . Together , these results show that the morphology and dynamics of CME proteins are dis - tinctly specified for each defined cell type . We next compared rates of endocytic uptake of labeled trans - ferrin ( Tf ) in the three cell types . Although clathrin appeared to be the least dynamic in fibroblasts , it appeared that these cells internalize more Tf compared with hESCs and NPCs ( Fig . 2 E ) . However , fibroblasts might express more receptors on the PM . To account for this possibility , we normalized the amount of Tf taken up to the amount of Tf bound to receptors on the cell sur - face at time 0 ( Fig . 2 F ) . Interestingly , the fraction of the bound material that was internalized was lower in fibroblasts com - pared with the hESCs and NPCs ( Fig . 2 E , right graph ) . We com - pared the endocytic uptake rates of Tf in WT ( unedited ) hESCs and in the genome - edited hESCs and found that the rates were indistinguishable , which indicates that CME is not perturbed in the edited cells . Collectively , these data show that clathrin lattice structures on the PM are remodeled during stem cell differentiation and that the endocytic internalization process is differentiated between the three cell types . AP2 regulates CCS dynamics and size Because each cell type is characterized by a specific gene expres - sion pattern , and because our model avoids genetic variability , we made in - frame fusions of tagGFP2 to the gene encoding the μ2 sub - unit of the clathrin adaptor AP2 , as described previously ( Fortian et al . , 2015 ; Hong et al . , 2015 ) . As we differentiated the hESCs into fibroblasts and NPCs , we found that AP2 levels at endocytic sites changed during differentiation to these two cell types . The AP2 levels at endocytic sites decreased threefold in NPCs compared with hESCs , and increased twofold in fibroblasts compared with hESCs ( Fig . 3 A and Video 4 ) . Interestingly , AP2μ2 expression lev - els were similar in hESCs and NPCs , but were elevated in fibro - blasts ( Figs . 1 D and 3 B ) . We hypothesized that AP2μ2 expression levels might influence CME site structure and dynamics , espe - cially because experimental lowering of AP2 levels previously was shown to reduce CCV diameter ( Miller et al . , 2015 ) . To test this hypothesis , we partially depleted AP2μ2 using a validated siRNA ( Boucrot et al . , 2015 ) in fibroblasts ( Fig . 3 , C – E ; and Video 5 ) . In AP2μ2 - depleted fibroblasts , the large clathrin structures disap - peared ( Fig . 3 C ) . In addition , clathrin lifetimes decreased ( 60 ± 0 . 6 s in AP2 - depleted cells compared with 80 ± 1 . 6 s in control cells ; Fig . 3 D ) , and we observed a dramatic increase in CME productiv - ity ( Fig . 3 E ) . Together , these results reveal that during fibroblast differentiation , AP2 expression levels increase , which contributes to formation of the large , static clathrin structures . Likewise , we infer that reduction of AP2 expression during NPC differentiation promotes formation of uniformly small and highly dynamic CME sites . To regulate endocytic dynamics and structure , the cell finely tunes the expression of core CME components . Actin functions in CME in a cell type – dependent manner In platinum replica EM , we observed that all clathrin structures , even the flat structures in hESCs and NPCs , were associated with actin filaments , as observed previously in mouse melanoma cells ( Collins et al . , 2011 ; Fig . 2 A ) . In mammalian cells , different effects of actin depolymerizing and stabilizing drugs on CME dynam - ics have been observed in different cell lines and cell contexts , showing a disparity in the actin requirement for CME ( Fujimoto et al . , 2000 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ; Brady et al . , 2010 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ; Cheng et al . , 2012 ; Taylor et al . , 2012 ; Grassart et al . , 2014 ) . Here , to determine whether actin dependence is a product of cell fate , we treated the three isogenic cell types with Latrunculin A ( LatA ) and Jasplakinolide ( Jasp ) , actin depolymerizing and stabi - lizing drugs , respectively ( Videos 6 and 7 ) . We analyzed the effect of these drugs on the CME productivity , clathrin and dynamin lifetimes , and CCP stabilization ( Fig . 4 , A and B ; Fig . S4 , A – C ; and Table 1 ) . Dramatic differences in drug effects were observed , which may relate to differences in the actin cortex observed in EM ( Figs . S1 , S2 , and S3 ) and light microscopy ( unpublished data ) . Overall , endocytosis in hESCs and NPCs responded to LatA treatment similarly : the productivity decreased and clathrin and dynamin were stabilized for most CCPs , with a shorter lifetime when endocytic events were productive . Interestingly , in NPCs , Jasp had the same effects as LatA , except that it did not affect endocytic lifetimes . However , in hESCs , Jasp treatment resulted in a twofold increase in CME productivity as well as a slight Dambournet et al . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis in differentiation Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201710084 3304 increase in clathrin and dynamin lifetimes , but it did not stabilize CCPs . In contrast , in fibroblasts , clathrin and dynamin lifetimes were unaffected by LatA and Jasp treatment , but LatA resulted in an increase in CME productivity , whereas Jasp treatment dra - matically increased the number of large clathrin structures and stabilized CCPs ( Fig . S4 D , Fig . 4 C , and Table 1 ) . The variety of effects of the actin drugs on the different cell types indicates that actin performs different functions at different stages of CME in the different cell types . In NPCs , actin is required for vesicle scis - sion by DNM2 , as found previously in some tissue culture cells Figure 2 . Ultrastructure of clathrin lattices in the three cell types .

In hESCs , however , actin was required for both early and late stages of CME . However , Jasp treatment increased CME productivity , perhaps through the stabilization of short actin filaments that could recruit actin - binding endocytic proteins or aid in Arp2 / 3 activation at early stages of CME ( Bubb et al . , 2000 ) . In fibro - blasts , we observed that the large clathrin structures are often close to focal adhesions ( unpublished data ) . The effect of actin drugs in fibroblasts might therefore be associated with the stabi - lization of focal adhesions in LatA - and Jasp - treated cells ( Zamir et al . , 2000 ; Hoffman et al . , 2006 ) , although the increase in CME productivity in LatA - treated fibroblasts might result from desta - bilization of clustered curved clathrin structures . Phosphoinositide ( PI ) - 3 kinase modulates receptor - mediated endocytosis We hypothesized that rewiring of signal transduction pathways during cell differentiation leads to differences in cell signaling that contribute to the distinct CME site structures and dynam - ics for each of the three cell types . The PI - 3 kinase pathway is associated with activation and signaling of a variety of receptors including EGF receptor and G - protein – coupled receptors ( Sorkin and von Zastrow , 2009 ) . We treated each of the cell types with the PI - 3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 ( LY ; Gharbi et al . , 2007 ) and observed dramatic differences ( Fig . 5 A , Video 8 , and Table 1 ) . In all three cell types , LY treatment induced a dramatic decrease in clathrin and dynamin lifetimes at the PM for the dynamic CME sites ( Fig . 5 D ) . In hESCs , but not NPCs or fibroblasts , we also observed a twofold increase in the occurrence of stabilized CCPs , though not a decreased CME productivity ( Fig . 5 , B and C ) . Interestingly , the effects of PI - 3 kinase inhibition in hESCs are similar to those reported after depletion of the PI - 3 kinase C2α in Cos7 cells ( Posor et al . , 2013 ) . In NPCs , the CME productiv - ity decreased dramatically , whereas it increased in fibroblasts . Here , our results establish that the requirement for PI - 3 kinase in CCP maturation differs between the three different isogenic Figure 3 .

Because downstream effectors of the PI - 3 kinase path - way have recently been shown to play an important role in CME ( Liberali et al . , 2014 ; Reis et al . , 2015 ) , future studies are required to determine which of the downstream effectors or lipid modi - fications affect CME in each cell type , and whether the differ - ential effects observed are a result of differences in PI - 3 kinase isoforms present in the three cell types or indirect effects at other trafficking steps , such as at endosomes . Discussion As cells differentiate , essentially every aspect of their physiology and structure becomes adapted to their new state . To date , studies have almost exclusively focused on the gene expression changes that underlie differentiation rather than on how cell structure and function are adapted . Here , we used genome - edited human stem cells to study how cellular processes are altered during differentiation in isogenic cells . We genome - edited hESCs and used cell differentiation protocols to create an isogenic set of cells to uncover cell type – specific mechanistic differences in CME . Previously , CME dynamics had been studied in a variety of nonisogenic cell lines representing different cell types and spe - cies . These cell lines were almost always derived from cancers and are therefore characterized by chromosome instability and associated phenotypic variation . These uncontrolled variables in cell physiology and structure , and the practice of overexpressing Table 1 .

Here , we developed a system that allowed us to determine how various previously made observations fit together in a coherent , physi - ologically relevant manner as cells differentiate , and to identify the underlying , developmentally regulated basis for establishing the new cell phenotypes . Clathrin dynamics and morphology are adapted upon cell differentiation Our use of isogenic cells of three different types for this study enabled us to demonstrate that the ubiquitous process of CME is versatile and can be adapted to the specifications required in each new cell type . Clathrin dynamics are dramatically differ - ent in NPCs and fibroblasts , cells that arise from different lin - eages , ectoderm and mesoderm , respectively , and have different roles within the body . It is interesting to speculate about why CME might have different characteristics in different cell types . NPCs are highly motile cells that give rise to neurons and glial cells , both of which produce highly elongated structures during differentiation . Perhaps extensive PM remodeling by dynamic CME is required for high cell motility and / or production of the elongated structures . In contrast , fibroblasts have low motility and interact tightly with the extracellular matrix through focal adhesions . Focal adhesions are known to participate in forma - tion and stabilization of large clathrin plaques ( Ezratty et al . , 2009 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . Furthermore , fibroblasts respond to chemical and mechanical signals during wound healing and can be differentiated into specialized cells depending on substrate stiffness ( Engler et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly , clathrin plaques are suggested to serve as hubs for cell signaling by specific receptors such as LPAR ( lysophosphatidic acid receptor ; Leyton - Puig et al . , 2017 ) . These observations raise the possibility that in fibroblasts , Figure 5 . The PI - 3 kinase pathway plays a cell type – specific role in CME .

Clathrin - mediated endocytosis in differentiation Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201710084 3308 large clathrin plaques sense mechanochemical cues for efficient cellular responses . Recently different clathrin assembly models have been pro - posed : a constant curvature model , a constant area model , and a flat - to - curved transition model , which depends on the AP2 / clathrin ratio ( Heuser , 1980 ; Avinoam et al . , 2015 ; Lampe et al . , 2016 ; Bucher et al . , 2018 ) . Interestingly , we found in isogenic cells that clathrin ultrastructure varies dramatically from one cell type to another . Based on our results , it seems that the pro - pensity for clathrin structures to evolve from flat to curved struc - tures may be different in fibroblasts compared with hESCs or NPCs . In NPCs , clathrin structures appear to start as small , flat structures , with the coat area growing as the curvature of the future vesicle increases . This observation is consistent with the models proposed by Bucher et al . ( 2018 ) and Scott et al . ( 2018 ) . However , in fibroblasts , most of the flat structures are larger and are connected to domed and / or spherical structures ( Fig . 2 , B and D ) . These structures raise the possibilities that either new clath - rin molecules are recruited at the edge of these flat structures , where they assemble directly into curved structures , or the flat clathrin lattice rearranges into curved structures . Another pos - sibility is that “activation” of the AP2 complex , by sufficient load - ing of AP2 - bound receptors within the clathrin lattice , induces a change in conformation of clathrin , and then the bending of the PM ( Dannhauser and Ungewickell , 2012 ; Dannhauser et al . , 2015 ; Kadlecova et al . , 2017 ; Fig . 2 D ) . These two possibilities are not exclusive , as it has been proposed recently that membrane bending can occur either as clathrin assembles at the PM or after its assembly ( Scott et al . , 2018 ) . Because optimal growth conditions ( media and substrate ) dif - fer for each cell type , it was possible that differences observed were a result of these differences rather than the distinct differ - entiated states of the cells . In fact , the growth conditions and dif - ferentiated states are intimately connected . Nevertheless , we did grow fibroblasts on matrigel and in separate experiments tested mTESR medium on the fibroblasts , and observed similar dynam - ics and morphology compared with growth in the normal media and on their normal substrate . AP2 levels at CME sites dictate CCV architecture and dynamics Our studies revealed that differentiation is accompanied by a dramatic change in AP2 expression . We found that AP2 is up - regulated during fibroblast differentiation and is elevated compared with hESCs and NPCs . Our knockdown study provided direct evidence that elevated AP2 levels are responsible of the for - mation of large clathrin plaques , as knocking down AP2 expres - sion eliminated plaques and increased dynamics . The presence of smaller , more highly curved clathrin structures in NPCs , which have significantly lower AP2 levels , seems consistent with the idea posited by Bucher et al . ( 2018 ) that curvature is promoted by higher clathrin / AP2 ratios and the demonstration by Miller et al . ( 2015 ) that lower AP2 levels decrease CCV diameter . Although AP2 is a key component of the endocytic machinery , it is likely that additional endocytic proteins are differentially regulated during differentiation into different cell types . Thus , further studies will be needed to identify the components responsible for the dynamics differences between the hESCs and the NPCs , especially because , based on the differential drug sensitivity , we hypothesize that the actin cytoskeleton might play an unex - pected role during early stages of CME in hESCs . A general approach for investigation of how cellular processes are adapted during differentiation Pluripotent stem cells have the ability to differentiate into essen - tially any cell type , offering an opportunity to determine how cellular processes become adapted for the functions and proper - ties of different cell types . Studies of how cellular processes are modified during stem cell differentiation eliminate confounding effects caused by genetic variability and chromosome instability because the resulting cells are isogenic , have normal physiology , and have normal karyotypes . This approach allowed us to dis - cover programmed changes in protein expression and endocytic site ultrastructure and dynamics . Furthermore , the insertion of a fluorescent protein coding sequence at the endogenous locus in stem cells by genome editing eliminates cell - to - cell expression variability and overexpression effects caused by random plas - mid integration . Extension of this approach promises to make possible determination of how many additional cellular pro - cesses are adapted during differentiation , and to identify the key factors involved . Materials and methods Cell culture hESCs ( WIBR3 , National Insitutes of Health stem cell registra - tion 0079 ) were cultured as previously described ( Soldner et al . , 2009 ; Hockemeyer et al . , 2011 ) . In brief , hESCs were maintained on a layer of inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts in hESC medium ( DMEM / F12 ; Lifetech ) supplemented with 20 % Knock - Out Serum Replacement ( Lifetech ) , 1 mM glutamine ( Lifetech ) , 1 % nonessential amino acids ( Lifetech ) , 0 . 1 mM β - mercaptoeth - anol ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 1 , 000 U / ml penicillin / streptomycin ( Life - tech ) , and 4 ng / ml FGF2 ( Lifetech ) . Cultures were passaged every 7 d with collagenase type IV ( 1 . 5 mg / ml ; Lifetech ) and gravita - tional sedimentation by washing three times in wash medium ( DMEM / F12 ; Lifetech ) supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum ( Lifetech ) , and 1 , 000 U / ml penicillin / streptomycin ( Lifetech ) . Cell lines were tested for mycoplasma infection every month . Differentiation into NPCs and fibroblasts hESCs were differentiated into NPCs and fibroblasts as previ - ously described ( Chiba et al . , 2015 ) . NPC differentiation Cells were cultured under feeder free conditions on matrigel - coated plates in mTESR1 medium ( Stem Cell Technologies ) . The dual SMAD inhibition protocol for the differentiation of hESCs into NPCs was adapted from Chambers et al . ( 2009 ) . In brief , hESCs were cultured for 10 d with increasing amounts of N2 medium ( 50 % DMEM / F12 ; Lifetech ) , 50 % Neurobasal Medium ( Lifetech ) , 0 . 75 % BSA ( wt / vol ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , N2 Supplement ( Lifetech ) , 20 ng / ml insulin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 1 mM glutamine ( Lifetech ) , 1 , 000 U / ml penicillin / streptomycin ( 25 % , 50 % , 75 % ; Lifetech ) supplemented with KOSR medium ( hESC medium without FGF ) , Dambournet et al . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis in differentiation Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201710084 3309 100 ng / µl Noggin ( R & D Systems ) , and 10 µM SB431542 ( Tocris ) . NPCs were maintained in N2 medium supplemented with 25 ng / ml FGF2 ( Lifetech ) and 40 ng / ml EGF ( R & D Systems ) . Fibroblast differentiation For the formation of embryonic bodies , hESC colonies were grown on ultralow attachment plates ( Corning ) in fibroblast medium ( DMEM / F12 ; Lifetech ) supplemented with 15 % fetal bovine serum ( Lifetech ) , 1 mM glutamine ( Lifetech ) , 1 % nones - sential amino acids ( Lifetech ) , and penicillin / streptomycin ( Life - tech ) . After 9 d , embryonic bodies were transferred to tissue cul - ture dishes coated with 0 . 2 % gelatin and maintained in fibroblast medium ( Ahfeldt et al . , 2012 ) . Gene targeting in hESCs Cas9 and single guide RNAs were expressed using the pX330 plasmid ( Cong et al . , 2013 ; Ran et al . , 2013 ) . The CLTA genes were targeted as previously described using a paired ZFN that targets exon 7 and cuts precisely at the stop codon ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ; Hong et al . , 2015 ) . TAL ENs targeted exon 7 and were designed to cut the AP2M1 gene locus at a site corresponding to residue 236 of the AP2 μ subunit ( Hong et al . , 2015 ) . The design of donor plasmids and ZFNs was described previously ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ) . The DNM2 gene was targeted at exon 22 using CRI SPR / Cas9 and 5′ - CCT GCT CGA CTA GGC CTC GA - 3′ as a guide RNA , which cuts in the immediate vicinity of the stop codon . 1 – 2 × 10 7 hESCs were electroporated with 5 µg of each ZFN / TAL EN ( or 10 µg of pX330 Cas9 plasmid ) and 40 µg of donor plasmid . Cells were sorted out by an Influx sorter ( BD Bioscience ) for GFP and / or RFP fluorescence 72 h after electroporation . Clonal populations were isolated and characterized as previously described ( Dambournet et al . , 2014 ) . TIR FM and live - cell imaging 48 h before imaging , hESCs and NPCs were seeded onto Matrigel - coated glass coverslips and fibroblasts onto gelatin - coated coverslips . TIR FM images were captured using Meta - Morph software on an Olympus IX - 81 microscope outfitted with an APON 60× / 1 . 49 NA TIR FM oil objective and an ORCA - R2 cam - era ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) . Cells were imaged in their appropri - ate media and kept at 37°C during imaging . A DV2 image splitter ( MAG Biosystems ) was used to separate GFP and RFP emission signals . Time - lapse videos were obtained with 500 - ms exposure times , at 2 - s intervals , and with 4 – 6 - min duration . Tf uptake assay using a flow cytometer The Tf endocytosis assay was modified from Grassart et al . ( 2014 ) . In brief , hESCs , NPCs , and fibroblasts were seeded on a 24 - well plate 2 d before the analysis . After 30 min in serum starvation medium ( HBSS + BSA ) , cells were incubated with 20 µg / ml Tf – Alexa Fluor 647 at 37°C . Cells were then transferred to ice , and surface - bound Tf – Alexa Fluor 647 was removed using ice - cold acid buffer ( HBSS , 0 . 5 % acetic acid , and 0 . 5 M NaCl ) for 45 s . The cell culture medium was then neutralized by extensive washes with DMEM - BSA . Cells were collected using EDTA - Trypsin , washed , and fixed in cold 4 % PFA . Intracellular fluorescence of Tf – Alexa Fluor 647 was quantified by a flow cytometer ( LSR Fortessa ; BD Bioscience ) . Results in Fig . 1 F were normalized to the surface expression of Tf receptor , evaluated by incubation of the cells with Tf – Alexa Fluor 647 on ice for 30 min . Drug perturbations Before imaging , cells were treated with appropriate culture media containing 0 . 01 % ( vol / vol ) DMSO , 1 µM Jasp , 0 . 1 – 1 µM LatA , or 10 µM LY . Of note , fibroblasts were more sensitive than NPCs and hESCs to LatA treatment , so we used 100 nM LatA instead of 1 µM , consistent with previous findings that LatA has a dose - dependent effect on endocytosis ( Grassart et al . , 2014 ) . Image analysis We tracked the positions of the fluorescent spots in each chan - nel over time using the detection and tracking portions of the cmeAnalysis software ( Aguet et al . , 2013 ) . We wrote a script in Matlab to extract the x - y coordinates for use in a custom - written program that associates , classifies , and plots corresponding GFP and RFP tracks ( Hong et al . , 2015 ) . Only clathrin - and DNM2 - associated tracks were considered as bona fide endocytic events . Track output was then inspected individually to correct for asso - ciation errors . Only tracks that appeared and disappeared during the lifetime of the acquisition ( i . e . , 121 frames , 4 min ) were sub - jected to lifetime analyses . The programs are available for down - load in the online supplemental material . Unroofing and EM Cells were prepared as described for live - cell imaging . Cells were washed in stabilization buffer ( 70 mM KCl , 30 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 3 mM EGTA [ all from Sigma - Aldrich ] ) . The cells were then unroofed using a 10 - ml syringe with a 22 - gauge , 1 . 5 - in needle with 2 % PFA ( EM Sciences ) diluted in stabilization buffer . Cells were then transferred and fixed for 20 min in 2 % glutaraldehyde ( EM Sciences ) . Transmission EM of platinum cell membrane replicas was performed as previously described ( Sochacki et al . , 2017 ) . RNAi and Western blot experiments Fibroblasts were transfected with the corresponding siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . A nontargeting siRNA pool ( siRNA control ; ON - TAR GETplus SMA RTpool siRNA 4 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ; Grassart et al . , 2014 ) and Stealth HSS101955 against AP2μ2 ( Invitrogen ; Boucrot et al . , 2015 ) were used for depletion experiments . RNAi knockdown efficiency was verified by Western blot , and cells were imaged 72 h after transfection . Cells were lysed in lysis buf - fer ( 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and protease inhibitor ) and loaded onto an acrylamide gel for SDS - PAGE followed by immunoblotting . Blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C with primary anti - bodies and subsequently incubated in the dark at room tempera - ture with secondary antibodies . Membranes were scanned on an Odyssey infrared imager ( LI - COR Biosciences ) . Quantification of protein bands was performed using Image Studio ( version 3 . 1 ) .
