This polar auxin transport 34 predominantly relies on PIN - FORMED ( PIN ) auxin exporters . Hence , PIN polarization 35 is crucial for development , but its evolution during the rise of morphological complexity 36 in land plants remains unclear . Here , we performed a cross - species investigation by 37 observing the trafficking and localization of endogenous and xenologous PINs in two 38 bryophytes , Physcomitrium patens and Marchantia polymorpha , and in the flowering 39 plant Arabidopsis thaliana . We confirmed that the GFP fusion did not compromise the 40 auxin export function of all examined PINs by using radioactive auxin export assay 41 and by observing the phenotypic changes in transgenic bryophytes . Endogenous PINs 42 polarize to filamentous apices , while xenologous Arabidopsis PINs distribute 43 symmetrically on the membrane in both bryophytes . In Arabidopsis root epidermis , 44 bryophytic PINs show no defined polarity . Pharmacological interference revealed a 45 strong cytoskeleton dependence of bryophytic but not Arabidopsis PIN polarization . 46 The divergence of PIN polarization and trafficking is also observed within the 47 bryophyte clade and between tissues in individual species . These results collectively 48 reveal a divergence of PIN trafficking and polarity mechanisms throughout land plant 49 evolution and a co - evolution of PIN sequence - based and cell - based polarity 50 mechanisms . 51 52 53 Key words : Arabidopsis , evolution , Marchantia , Physcomitrium , PINs , polarization , 54 protein trafficking 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 Introduction 65 Auxin is a crucial regulator of polarity and morphogenesis in land plants ( Kato et al . , 66 2018 ; Leyser , 2018 ; Mockaitis and Estelle , 2008 ; Smit and Weijers , 2015 ; Yu et al . , 67 2022 ) . The auxin gradients and local maxima within tissues coordinate a broad 68 spectrum of plant development , ranging from embryogenesis to organ formation and 69 tropisms ( Friml , 2021 ; Vanneste and Friml , 2009 ) . The establishment of the auxin 70 gradient relies dominantly on directional auxin transport driven by the efflux carriers , 71 PIN - FORMEDs ( PINs ) . In different tissues , specific PINs are polarized at different 72 plasma membrane ( PM ) domains , thus directly driving the directionality of auxin flow 73 ( Adamowski and Friml , 2015 ) . Therefore , given the essential impact of auxin flow in 74 various developmental processes , the function and polarization of PIN proteins are 75 crucial for maintaining the correct pattern of plant growth and patterning ( Sauer and 76 Kleine - Vehn , 2019 ) . 77 PINs are found in all land plants and can be traced back to charophytic green 78 algae ( Skokan et al . , 2019 ; Viaene et al . , 2013 ) . The functional conservation of PINs 79 in the auxin transport has also been demonstrated by exogenously expressing PINs 80 from the green algae Klebsormidium flaccidum ( K . flaccidum ) , the moss 81 Physcomitrium patens ( P . patens ) , and the angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana in 82 transgenic plants and in heterologous systems ( Skokan et al . , 2019 ; Zourelidou et al . , 83 2014 ) . Additionally , when xenologous PINs from charophytes or Arabidopsis are 84 overexpressed in P . patens , the transgenic plants show growth inhibition that 85 resembles auxin deprivation phenotypes ( Lavy et al . , 2016 ; Skokan et al . , 2019 ; Tao 86 and Estelle , 2018 ; Viaene et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , these observations support the idea 87 that PIN - mediated polar auxin transport may govern plant development since the 88 emergence of land plants . 89 PIN polarity regulations have been extensively investigated in the angiosperm 90 Arabidopsis . Canonical PINs , featuring a long central hydrophilic loop ( HL ) between 91 two transmembrane domains , are delivered via the ER - Golgi vesicle trafficking 92 pathway to the plasma membrane ( PM ) . De - polymerization of actin filaments induces 93 the accumulation of PIN - labelled small intracellular puncta near the PM , but with no 94 apparent PIN polarity defect ( Geldner et al . , 2001 ; Glanc et al . , 2018 ; 2019 ) . 95 Microtubules are involved in the cytokinetic trafficking of PINs , but are not required for 96 the polarity establishment or maintenance at the PM of non - dividing cells ( Geldner et 97 al . , 2001 ; Glanc et al . , 2019 ; Kleine - Vehn et al . , 2008b ) . Notably , the disruption of both 98 cytoskeletal networks delays but does not abolish AtPIN2 polarization in Arabidopsis 99 epidermal cells ( Glanc et al . , 2019 ) . This suggests that the cytoskeletal networks are 100 involved , but not strictly essential for PIN polar trafficking , while other mechanisms 101 contribute to the PIN polar localization . PINs are known to undergo constitutive cycles 102 of endocytosis and recycling , which is modulated by auxin itself ( Narasimhan et al . , 103 2021 ; Narasimhan et al . , 2020 ) ; this process is essential for their polar distribution 104 ( Doyle et al . , 2015 ; Kleine - Vehn et al . , 2011 ) . 105 The Phosphorylation of specific sites within the HL region has been 106 demonstrated to be a critical determinant for PINs’ apical - basal polarization in 107 Arabidopsis epidermis . A serine / threonine kinase , PINOID ( PID ) , phosphorylates 108 specific sites on AtPIN2 and leads to its apical localization ( Friml et al . , 2004 ) . In 109 contrast , when phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) de - phosphorylates AtPIN2 , which counteracts 110 the PID - dependent phosphorylation , and thus guides the delivery of AtPIN2 to the 111 basal domain of epidermal cells ( Michniewicz et al . , 2007 ) . The phosphorylation sites 112 targeted by different kinase families are crucial for polar localizations and functions of 113 PINs , and most sites are highly conserved within Arabidopsis canonical PINs 114 ( Zwiewka et al . , 2019 ) . Since PINs are present in all land plants , one can hypothesize 115 that the phosphorylation - based polarity regulation may have been established since 116 the emergence of early land plants . However , it has never been clarified whether these 117 phosphorylation sites are evolutionary conserved in early land plants . 118 The PIN polarization has been observed in the early - divergent moss , P . patens , 119 which grows as filamentous protonemata , and its endogenous PpPINA - GFP shows a 120 polar localization at the tip of protonema cells ( Bennett et al . , 2014 ; Viaene et al . , 2014 ) . 121 However , the polar localization of PpPINA - GFP is not robust in other species . When 122 PpPINA - GFP is expressed in Arabidopsis root epidermal cells , where AtPIN2 - GFP 123 presents a clear apical localization , PpPINA - GFP is mislocalized at both basal and 124 apical sites ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . Furthermore , PINs from the liverwort , Marchantia 125 polymorpha ( M . polymorpha ) , and from the green algae , K . flaccidum , are also 126 mislocalized in root epidermal cells of Arabidopsis ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . These 127 distinctive PIN localizations in different species suggest that mechanisms for PINs 128 trafficking and polarization may have diversified after the emergence of land plants . 129 Despite the profound significance of PIN polarization and the resulting directional 130 auxin transport for land plant development , PIN trafficking and polarization 131 mechanisms are mainly derived from the angiosperm model Arabidopsis thaliana . 132 Here we investigated PIN trafficking / polarization mechanisms from an 133 evolutionary perspective . We show that canonical PINs from bryophytes P . patens , M . 134 polymorpha , and Arabidopsis present high conservation in their transmembrane 135 domains and phosphorylation sites . Endogenous PIN - GFPs show different localization 136 patterns in various developmental contexts , suggesting tissue - specific PIN 137 polarization mechanisms . Cross - species investigation revealed that xenologous PINs 138 can traffic to the PM but fail to enrich at the polar domains revealing species - specific 139 mechanisms for PIN polarization . This notion was further verified by different 140 dependency of cytoskeletons for the polarization of Arabidopsis PINs and bryophytic 141 PINs . Overall , our results highlight that PINs trafficking and polarization mechanisms 142 underwent complex evolution during the gradual rise of morphological complexity in 143 land plants . 144 145 Results 146 Phosphorylation sites are highly conserved between bryophytic and 147 Arabidopsis PINs 148 To dissect the conservation between bryophytic and Arabidopsis PINs , we first 149 performed a phylogenetic analysis . The coding sequence of the single canonical PIN , 150 MpPINZ , from M . polymorpha , three canonical PINs , PpPINA - PpPINC , from P . patens , 151 and five canonical PINs , AtPIN1 - AtPIN4 and AtPIN7 , from Arabidopsis were subjected 152 to MEGA X program ( Kumar et al . , 2018 ) for the phylogenetic study . Bryophytic PINs 153 are categorized in one group , and the MpPINZ is closer to Arabidopsis PINs than 154 PpPINs are ( Figure 1A ) . Arabidopsis AtPIN1 and AtPIN2 were identified with clear 155 polarity at the PM that plays crucial role in embryogenesis , organ formation , and tropic 156 growth ( Krecek et al . , 2009 ; Omelyanchuk et al . , 2016 ) . The phylogenetic tree showed 157 that both AtPIN1 and AtPIN2 are equally close to bryophytic PINs , while AtPIN2 was 158 extensively investigated for its polarization in roots ( Abas et al . , 2006 ; Glanc et al . , 159 2018 ; Kleine - Vehn et al . , 2008a ) , thus we first picked AtPIN2 as our reference for 160 further alignment analyses . The identity index of coding amino acid sequences 161 showed that full - length AtPIN2 has around 50 % identity with each bryophytic PIN 162 ( Figure 1B ) . Since the transmembrane domains show a high similarity between all 163 examined PINs , we suspected that central HLs are more divergent . Surprisingly , the 164 identity index for only the HL region of AtPIN2 presented over 40 % identity with 165 MpPINZ ( 45 % ) , PpPINA ( 42 % ) , and PpPINB ( 43 % ) ( Figure 1B ) . The identity index of 166 full - length AtPIN1 and HLs showed similar results as AtPIN2 ( Supplemental Figure 1 ) . 167 The overview of coding sequences for all examined PINs revealed highly 168 conserved transmembrane domains at N - terminus and C - terminus , connected by a 169 less conserved HL region ( Figure 1C ) . Because the polarization of AtPIN2 is tightly 170 associated with its phosphorylation status on the HL , we used AtPIN2 as a reference 171 to search for and highlight these experimental - identified phosphorylation sites 172 ( Barbosa et al . , 2018 ; Sukumar et al . , 2009 ; Zhang et al . , 2010 ) . Comparing to 173 transmembrane domains , despite of a relatively lower conservation in their HLs , the 174 four identified phosphorylation sites are fully conserved between Arabidopsis PINs and 175 bryophytic PINs ( Figure 1D ) , which suggests that the PIN phosphorylation might be 176 evolutionarily conserved for the regulation of their intracellular localization . 177 178 The hydrophilic loops in AtPIN2 , PpPINA , and MpPINZ are less conserved 179 To dissect how conserved between Arabidopsis PINs and bryophytic PINs is in their 180 protein structures , we next performed structural prediction and alignment . Structures 181 predicted by the Alphafold2 program resemble newly resolved structures of AtPIN1 182 and AtPIN8 ( Supplemental Figure 2 ) ( Jumper et al . , 2021 ; Ung et al . , 2022 ; Yang et 183 al . , 2022 ) , supporting that the structure prediction is reliable . Therefore , to compare 184 the structures of well - investigated polarized AtPINs , we predicted the structures of 185 AtPIN1 and AtPIN2 by Alphafold2 and aligned their predicted structures in ChimeraX 186 ( Jumper et al . , 2021 ; Pettersen et al . , 2021 ) . The structural conservation was 187 presented in almost perfect alignment of transmembrane domains while their HL 188 regions showed similar patterns ( Figure 2A , close arrowheads ) with two extra random 189 loops in AtPIN2 ( Figure 2A , open arrowheads ) . We next aligned the structure of AtPIN2 190 with PpPINA and MpPINZ . The transmembrane domains are highly conserved with 191 nearly perfect alignments , but the HLs are less conserved that only one loop showed 192 partial similarity ( Figure 2B , close arrowheads ) . Note that to reveal the conservation 193 and phosphorylation sites clearly , the orientation of protein structures presented in 194 Figure 2A and 2B - E were rotated in different angles . In general , bryophytic PINs 195 possess loosen and larger loops compared to AtPIN2 ( Figure 2B - 2E ) . The predicted 196 structures were shown individually with the annotated phosphorylation sites that are 197 indicated in Figure 1D ( Figure 2C - 2E ) . The structural conservations in transmembrane 198 domains imply that ancestry bryophytic PINs may traffic to the PM through the same 199 delivery pathways as Arabidopsis PINs , whereas the loosen loops with conserved 200 phosphorylation sites suggest a deviation from conserved regulation for their 201 polarization . 202 203 GFP - fused PIN proteins possess auxin export activity 204 The sequence and structural analyses between Arabidopsis PINs and bryophytic PINs 205 revealed high conservation in sequence , phosphorylation sites , and structures of 206 transmembrane domains . Thus , we next would like to investigate whether bryophytic 207 PINs are delivered to the PM with polar domain enrichment as Arabidopsis PINs . To 208 achieve this , we first generated PINs with GFP - fused into an equivalent position of 209 AtPIN1 , AtPIN2 , PpPINA , and MpPINZ as shown in Figure 3A ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . To 210 verify the auxin export function of these GFP - fused PINs , we subcloned each GFP - 211 fused PIN gene into a moss vector , where each PIN - GFP gene was driven by an 212 inducible XVE promoter ( Kubota et al . , 2013 ) . We generated transgenic moss plants 213 carrying different XVE : : PIN - GFPs separately , and we used these transgenic lines to 214 perform the auxin export assay . In brief , the overexpression of PIN - GFPs were 215 induced for 3 days , followed by a radioactive auxin H 3 - IAA treatment for 24 hours . The 216 radioactive tissues were then washed twice and were incubated in fresh growth 217 mediums for another 24 hrs . The culture medium was collected for H 3 scintillation 218 detection ( Lewis and Muday , 2009 ) . The wild - type moss plants were taken along as 219 an internal control to show the basal exportation of H 3 - IAA by endogenous PpPINs . In 220 comparison to the wild - type , all examined PIN - GFP plants showed higher amount of 221 radioactive auxin in the culture medium , indicating their auxin export activities ( Figure 222 3B ) . 223 Additionally , the function of PIN - GFPs was also confirmed in the growth 224 changes caused by PIN - GFPs overexpression in both P . patens . and M . polymorpha . 225 During early development , P . patens gradually transits its filamentous protonemata 226 from thicker / shorter chloronema cells with perpendicular division planes to 227 thinner / longer caulonema cells with oblique division planes ( Rensing et al . , 2020 ) . In 228 the previous study , PpPINA , PpPINB , and PpPIND overexpression has been 229 demonstrated to inhibit the protonema transition ( Viaene et al . , 2014 ) . Here we 230 showed that overexpression of PpPINA - , AtPIN1 - , and AtPIN2 - GFP led to similar 231 defects in this chloronema - caulonema transition with a shorter cell length of the 232 subapical cell and a smaller division angle ( Figure 3C - 3E ) . The wild - type M . 233 polymorpha has prostrate thalli ; however , with the overexpression of either MpPINZ - 234 GFP or AtPIN - GFPs , the thallus grew more vertically , as apparent from the side view 235 ( Figure 3F ) , phenocopying the auxin deficient phenotype ( Kato et al . , 2017 ) . The 236 angles between the thallus and the horizontal agar were measured to quantify the 237 vertical growth ( Figure 3G ) . The overexpression of MpPINZ - GFP caused the most 238 striking phenotype , but the overexpression of AtPIN - GFPs also resulted in a vertical 239 growth that showed significant differences from the wild - type . Our results show that all 240 PIN - GFPs can export auxin in the moss system and cause phenotypic changes in both 241 P . patens and M . polymorpha upon overexpression . 242 243 Endogenous PINs present different localization patterns in different types of 244 tissue 245 To observe the PpPINA - GFP localization in P . patens , we used a stable moss 246 transgenic line carrying the native promoter controlled PpPINA genomic DNA - GFP 247 fusion ( pPINA : : PpPINA - GFP ) where GFP was inserted in the same position as we 248 verified . The moss P . patens has a filamentous protonema stage and a leafy 249 gametophore stage in its life cycle . The initial protonema cell was newly regenerated 250 from a detached leaf , and the elongated protonema was imaged from a 6 - days - old 251 moss colony . PpPINA - GFP localized at the PM of the protonema tip with a clear 252 polarity in both initial and elongated protonemata ( Figure 4A ) . To examine whether the 253 polar localization of PpPINA - GFP appears in complex tissues composed of multiple 254 cell layers as well , we observed its localization in gametophytic leaves . In young 255 gametophytic leaves , PpPINA - GFP showed clear basal - apical polarization along the 256 leaf axis with notable corner enrichment ( Figure 4A ) , whereas in mature leaves 257 PpPINA - GFP was evenly distributed on the PM ( Supplemental Figure 3 ) . We also 258 analyzed another endogenous P . patens PpPINB , fused with GFP and driven by its 259 endogenous promoter . Notably , PpPINB - GFP did not show visible polarity at the tip of 260 protonema , but more even PM distribution with an increased intracellular signal 261 ( Supplemental Figure 4 ) . The difference between the localization of PpPINA - GFP and 262 PpPINB - GFP suggests different trafficking and polarization pathways for different PINs 263 co - existing in the same cell already in bryophytes . 264 The divergence of PpPINA - GFP polarity in filamentous protonema cells and in 265 gametophytic leaves made us wondering if this tissue - specific polarization of PINs is 266 conserved in other bryophytes . To achieve this , we looked at another bryophyte , the 267 liverwort M . polymorpha that produces gemmae as the asexual reproductive progenies 268 consisted of multiple cell layers . After water imbibition , single - cellular rhizoids emerge 269 from the large rhizoid precursor cells on epidermis of a gemma ( Shimamura , 2016 ) . 270 To analyze the subcellular localization of the sole canonical PIN , MpPINZ , in M . 271 polymorpha , we generated a p35S : : MpPINZ - GFP transgenic line . Interestingly , 272 MpPINZ - GFP localized on the PM with small intracellular puncta and with no apparent 273 polarity in all gemma epidermal cells ( Figure 4B , right panel ) . However , when gemmae 274 were stimulated to grow rhizoids , the signal of MpPINZ - GFP accumulated at the 275 protrusion site of emerging rhizoids in the rhizoid precursor cells ( Figure 4B , yellow 276 arrowheads ) . Later after their emergence , MpPINZ - GFP was polarized at the tip of 277 young rhizoids ( Figure 4B ) , whereas the signal diminished when the rhizoids 278 elongated . 279 The localization of PpPINA - and MpPINZ - GFP in filamentous and complex 280 tissues suggests distinct polarity recognition mechanisms for bryophytic PINs in 281 different tissue types . To examine if Arabidopsis PINs show similar polar patterns as 282 bryophytic PINs in different types of tissues , we observed pPIN2 : : AtPIN2 - GFP line in 283 filamentous root hairs and complex epidermal cells . As previously described , AtPIN2 - 284 GFP showed apical localization in epidermal cells ( Figure 4C ) ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . 285 Since the polarity of bryophytic PINs in their original species mainly appeared at the 286 tip of filamentous tissues , we focused on the localization of AtPIN2 - GFP in initial and 287 elongated root hairs , respectively . AtPIN2 - GFP revealed a polar localization at the tip 288 of initial root hairs ( Figure 4C ) . However , the polarity of AtPIN2 - GFP signals diminished 289 in the elongated hairs ( Figure 4C ) . The different polarity patterns of PINs in different 290 types of tissue support the notion that regulations of PIN polarization are specialized 291 in different cellular profiles and in different developmental contexts . 292 293 Xenologous PINs are PM localized with no defined polarity 294 Since bryophytic and Arabidopsis PINs demonstrated tissue - and development - 295 specific polarity regulations , we wonder if the conserved phosphorylation sites in the 296 HL are sufficient to drive the polarization of xenologous PINs in other species . To 297 achieve this , we observed the same moss XVE : : PIN - GFPs transgenic lines we 298 generated for the auxin export assay , carrying PpPINA - , AtPIN1 - , and AtPIN2 - GFP , 299 respectively . In protonemata , AtPIN1 - GFP showed an even distribution on the PM and 300 cell division plane without apparent polarity at the tips , and displayed numerous small 301 intracellular puncta , whereas the PpPINA - GFP signal presented the same polarization 302 as driven by its endogenous promoter ( Figure 4A , 5A , and 5D ) . AtPIN2 - GFP under the 303 same induction condition showed much lower intensity but resembled AtPIN1 - GFP 304 localization patterns , we thus took AtPIN1 - GFP as representative images 305 ( Supplemental Figure 5 ) . A short - term induction of XVE : : AtPIN1 - GFP was performed , 306 and it showed no difference in the localization , which verified that the localization 307 patterns of AtPIN1 - GFP were not caused by overexpression ( Supplemental Video 1 ) . 308 To investigate whether these features are conserved in bryophytes , we 309 introduced AtPIN1 - GFP driven by the 35S promoter into M . polymorpha . In gemma 310 epidermal cells , the AtPIN1 - GFP showed a non - polar PM localization with high 311 cytosolic signals ( Supplemental Figure 6A ) . In emerging rhizoids , AtPIN1 - GFP did not 312 show visible polar localization in rhizoid precursor cells ( Supplemental Figure 6B ) . In 313 young rhizoids , where MpPINZ - GFP showed clear tip polarization , AtPIN1 - GFP was 314 evenly distributed on the PM with homogenized cytosolic signals ( Figure 5B and 5D ) . 315 Since our results indicated that Arabidopsis AtPIN1 - GFP in examined 316 bryophytes are delivered to the PM with no visible polarity , we next addressed whether 317 Arabidopsis trafficking machinery can polarize bryophytic PINs . To analyze bryophytic 318 PINs , we observed the protein localization at epidermal cells of transgenic Arabidopsis 319 lines expressing pPIN2 : : AtPIN2 - , PpPINA - , and MpPINZ - GFP ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . As 320 previously described , AtPIN2 - GFP showed apical localization in the epidermal cells , 321 while PpPINA - GFP localized at both the apical and basal sides and MpPINZ - GFP 322 mainly localized at the basal side with some lateral residence . ( Figure 5C and 5E ) 323 ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . These data thus support that the machinery driving PIN proteins 324 to the PM through a generally conserved cellular trafficking pathway , whereas the PIN 325 polarization is specialized in different species . 326 327 Cytoskeletal networks are important for the polarization of bryophytic PINs 328 The diversification of PIN polarities in different plant species and tissues suggests that 329 plant cells might utilize various machineries to deliver and maintain PIN proteins to the 330 target side on the PM . To verify this , we examined the necessity of the cytoskeletal 331 networks in the polarization of bryophytic PINs and AtPIN2 in their original species . 332 We depolymerized actin filaments or microtubules by treating plant tissues with 333 Latrunculin B ( LatB ) or Oryzalin ( Ory ) , respectively . In P . patens , the abolishment of 334 actin filaments resulted in the hyper - polarization of PpPINA - GFP , where PpPINA - GFP 335 accumulated at a focal locus to the very tip of the cell ( Figure 6A and 6C ) . The 336 disruption of microtubules resulted in less accumulation of PpPINA - GFP at the tip of 337 protonemata , and the PpPINA - GFP appeared to be detached from the PM ( Figure 6A 338 and 6C ) . The changes of PpPINA - GFP localization in response to drug treatments 339 demonstrated the requirement of cytoskeletal networks for PpPINA - GFP polarization 340 in filamentous tissues . 341 In M . polymorpha , we used the same pharmacological interference to 342 investigate whether the MpPINZ - GFP polarization in young rhizoids relies on the 343 cytoskeletal networks . MpPINZ - GFP remains polarized at the tip when actin filaments 344 were disrupted , while the disruption of microtubules resulted in the dislocation of the 345 polarized MpPINZ - GFP ( Figure 6B and 6C ) . These results collectively demonstrate 346 the diversification on cytoskeletal dependency for PINs polarization within the 347 bryophyte clade . 348 In Arabidopsis , the disruption of actin filaments by LatB resulted in an increasing 349 appearance of AtPIN2 - GFP signals in the cell interior , while the Ory treatment caused 350 a minor effect on AtPIN2 - GFP localization ( Figure 6D ) . Upon cytoskeleton disruption , 351 the apical polarization of AtPIN2 - GFP in epidermal cells was still evident ; suggesting 352 that in contrast to the dependency of cytoskeletal networks for the bryophytic PINs , 353 the polarization of Arabidopsis PINs mainly relies on other trafficking or polarity 354 retention mechanisms . Again , these results reinforce the notion that mechanisms 355 underlying PIN polarization have been expanded and specifically diversified in 356 different species . 357 358 359 Discussion 360 361 Evolution of sequence - specific determinants of PIN polarity 362 In flowering plants , as exemplified by Arabidopsis , the five PM - localized canonical 363 PINs show different polarities in different developmental and tissue contexts , thus 364 mediating directional auxin fluxes and generating asymmetric auxin distribution for 365 plethora of developmental processes ultimately shaping the plant form . Originating 366 from a single PIN auxin transporter , such as found in simple filamentous streptophyte 367 algae ( Skokan et al . , 2019 ) , PIN family radiated during evolution into PINs showing 368 different expression and localization patterns and mediating many developmental and 369 physiological functions . 370 Ectopic co - expression of PINs in the same cell type such as AtPIN1 and AtPIN2 371 in root epidermis can lead to diverse polarity patterns ( AtPIN1 – basal ; AtPIN2 – apical ) , 372 thus demonstrating simultaneous presence of multiple polarity mechanisms in those 373 cells ( Wisniewska et al . , 2006 ) . In this study , we showed that in bryophytes , as 374 exemplified by the moss P . patens , PpPINA and PpPINB endogenously expressed in 375 protonemata filaments , present different localization patterns ( Figure 4 and 376 Supplemental Figure 4 ) . PpPINA shows tip - focused PM localization , whereas PpPINB 377 can be found more spread on the PM and also intracellularly . Whereas , the functional 378 importance of this difference remains unclear , it clearly shows that already in 379 bryophytes , parallel polarity / trafficking mechanisms exists in the same cells , to which 380 different PINs can be recruited , presumably based on specific sequence - based signals . 381 Notably , the sequence alignment between the HL regions of PpPINA and 382 PpPINB showed 90 . 31 % identity , suggesting that these signals are presumably 383 encoded within the 10 % difference regions . Further analysis of the differences 384 between PpPINA and PpPINB or AtPIN1 and AtPIN2 would help to identify the 385 sequence signals for PIN polarity regulations . Despite the identity of the sequence - 386 based signals remain unclear , our observations show that cellular polarity mechanisms 387 and PIN sequence - based polarity signals , which are crucial for diverse developmental 388 roles in flowering plants , started to diversify already in bryophytes . 389 390 Context - specific determinants of PIN polarity 391 It is well known from Arabidopsis that the same PINs show different localization 392 patterns in different contexts ( Vieten et al . , 2005 ) . For example , AtPIN2 is apicalized 393 in epidermal cells , while it is localized on the basal side of young cortex cells ( Kleine - 394 Vehn et al . , 2008a ) . The observations imply that different cell types possess specific 395 trafficking pathways for the same PIN protein . In line with this , our results show that in 396 filamentous cells , e . g . , protonemata in P . patens , rhizoids in M . polymorpha , and root 397 hairs in Arabidopsis , endogenous PIN proteins are polarized at the tip of apical cells 398 ( Figure 4A - 4C ) . Notably , MpPINZ - GFP and AtPIN2 - GFP signals were diminished 399 when the rhizoids or root hairs elongated , and the PpPINA - GFP was polarized only in 400 young gametophytic leaves but the pattern dispersed in mature leaves . These data 401 collectively demonstrate that PIN polarity is differentially regulated in different 402 developmental contexts . 403 In complex tissues with multiple cell layers , unlike in filamentous tissues , the 404 PM - localized MpPINZ - GFP did not show polarity in thalli , while PpPINA - GFP and 405 AtPIN2 - GFP presented polar localization at the apical - basal domain of the cells 406 ( Figure 4A - 4C ) . This data shows that PIN polarity and trafficking mechanisms have 407 evolved with specific modifications in different tissues and cell types , in both 408 angiosperms and early - diverging land plants . This likely reflects different requirements 409 for directional auxin transport in different developmental contexts , and it implies a co - 410 evolution of PIN sequence - based signals and cell type - specific polar sorting and 411 trafficking mechanisms . 412 413 Diversification of PIN trafficking and polarity mechanisms during land plant 414 evolution 415 The core mechanisms for auxin biosynthesis , auxin signaling , and PIN - mediated auxin 416 transport are evolutionary conserved across land plants ( Blazquez et al . , 2020 ; Kato 417 et al . , 2018 ; Sauer and Kleine - Vehn , 2019 ) . However , bryophytes and vascular plants 418 diverged around 450 million years ago and emerged different types of tissues and 419 organs , it is not clear how conserved the PIN polarity regulation is under such drastic 420 changes during land plant evolution . Our cross - species studies revealed that 421 xenologous PINs , such as Arabidopsis PINs in bryophytes and bryophytic PINs in 422 Arabidopsis , are able to traffic to the PM ( Figure 5 ) , which suggests that all canonical 423 PINs can be recognized by the general protein transport machinery in other species . 424 Interestingly , when the Arabidopsis PINs are ectopically expressed in 425 bryophytes , they fail to form any specific polarity , whereas bryophytic PINs remain in 426 apical - basal domains in Arabidopsis epidermis ( Figure 5 ) . These observations may 427 hint an evolutionary loss of some regulatory motifs for PIN polarization that are 428 presence in bryophytic PINs but absence in Arabidopsis PINs . In line with this , the 429 overall coding sequences of bryophytic PINs are longer than Arabidopsis PINs , and 430 the extra sequences are positioned in their HLs , the main regulatory regions for PIN 431 polarization . Our study thus demonstrates that PINs polarity mechanisms are not 432 conserved throughout plant evolution . 433 This notion was also verified by the differences in cytoskeleton requirements 434 for PIN polarization between bryophytes and angiosperms . The polarity of bryophytic 435 PINs was disrupted when cytoskeletal networks are depolymerized , while Arabidopsis 436 AtPIN2 was not affected ( Figure 6 ) . This finding suggests a gradual shift in the 437 dependence of PIN polarity and trafficking from the cytoskeleton - dependent pathways 438 towards the cytoskeleton - independent pathways along the land plant evolution . 439 Overall , our results demonstrate that different plant species evolved specialized 440 pathways to deliver PINs and maintain their polarity at the PM . This is likely linked to 441 an increasing repertoire of auxin transport developmental roles adopted with 442 increasing morphological complexity during land plant evolution . 443 444 Methods 445 446 Plant growth and transformation 447 Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized and grown on 1 / 2 MS plates . After a two - 448 day stratification at 4  C , seedlings were grown under the long - day condition ( 16 hours 449 light , 8 hours dark ) at 22  C with 100 - 120 µmol photons m - 2 s - 1 white light . For P . patens , 450 all transgenic and WT plants were cultured on BCD medium plates in a growth 451 chamber at 24  C under the long - day condition ( 16 hours light , 8 hours dark ) with 452 35µmol photons m - 2 s - 1 white light . For M . polymorpha , WT and all transgenic plants 453 were cultured on 1 / 2 B5 plates in a growth chamber under the long - day condition ( 16 454 hours light , 8 hours dark ) at 22  C with 50 - 60 µmol photons m - 2 s - 1 white LED light . 455 All transgenic plants used in this study are listed in Supplemental Table 1 . P . 456 patens transgenic plants pPINA : : PINA - GFP has been generated and verified as 457 previously reported ( Viaene et al . , 2014 ) , and the inducible overexpression 458 XVE : : AtPIN1 - GFP , XVE : : AtPIN2 - GFP , and XVE : : MpPINZ - GFP lines were generated 459 as described in previous studies ( Tang et al . , 2020 ; Yamada et al . , 2016 ) . In brief , the 460 Gransden 2004 WT moss plants were freshly propagated and transformed via the 461 PEG - mediated transformation ( Nishiyama et al . , 2000 ) . The transformants were 462 selected under Hygromycin ( 20µg / mL ) , and two independent transgenic lines were 463 selected for imaging and analysis . 464 p35S : : MpPINZ - , AtPIN1 - , and AtPIN2 - GFP M . polymorpha plants were 465 generated via the Agrobacterium transformation method described before ( Kubota et 466 al . , 2013 ) . In brief , the apical meristemic region of each two - week - old Takaragaike - 1 467 ( Tak - 1 ) thallus was removed and further cut into four pieces . After culturing on 1 / 2 B5 468 with 1 % sucrose agar plates for 3 days , the cut thalli were transferred to 50ml 0M51C 469 medium with 200 µM acetosyringone ( 4 ' - Hydroxy - 3 ' , 5 ' - dimethoxyacetophenone ) in 470 200ml flasks with 130 rpm agitation to coculture with OD 600 = 1 density agrobacteria 471 harboring the target construct for another 3 days . The transformed thalli were washed 472 and plated on 1 / 2 B5 plates with proper antibiotic selection . Independent T1 lines were 473 isolated , and G1 lines from independent T1 lines were generated by sub - cultivating 474 single gemmalings , which emerged asexually from a single initial cell ( Shimamura , 475 2016 ) . The next generation of G1 , called the G2 generation , was used for analyses . 476 Arabidopsis transgenic lines bearing bryophytic PIN - GFPs under AtPIN2 promoter 477 control were generated and used as in a previous study ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . For root 478 imaging , seeds were sown on 1 / 2 Murashige – Skoog ( MS ) medium plates and kept at 479 4°C for 2 days and moved to the growth chamber to culture vertically for another 4 480 days . 481 482 Plasmid construction 483 Plasmids and primers for construction and genotype confirmation are listed in 484 Supplemental Table 2 . For transgenic lines with inducible overexpression by moss , the 485 insertion site of the GFP gene into the HL was indicated in Figure 3A , and the PIN - 486 GFP regions were amplified from previously generated plasmids ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) 487 by PCR and cloned into the gateway entry plasmid pENTR / D - TOPO ® as the 488 manufacturer suggested . The fragments were sub - cloned into the pPGX8 vector , 489 which contains a p 35S driven β - estradiol inducible XVE cassette ( Floriach - Clark et al . , 490 2021 ; Kubo et al . , 2013 ; Nakaoka et al . , 2012 ) via a Gateway ® LR reaction ( Invitrogen ) 491 as the manufacture’s recommendation . 492 To generate a p35S : : MpPINZ - , AtPIN1 - , and AtPIN2 - GFP construct , the cDNA 493 of the target fragment containing proper GFP insertion were amplified with the primers 494 listed in Supplemental Table 2 . The amplified fragments were cloned into the 495 pENTR / D - TOPO ® vector ( Invitrogen ) with the protocol supplied by the manufacturer . 496 Plasmids with target genes were further sub - cloned into the pMpGWB102 vector 497 containing a 35S promoter ( Ishizaki et al . , 2015 ) by the Gateway ® LR reaction 498 ( Invitrogen ) as the manufacturer’s recommendation . 499 500 Microscopy 501 For moss observation , protonemata were cultured in glass - bottom dishes covered by 502 BCD agar medium for 6 – 7d . The live - cell imaging was then performed on a Leica 503 SP8X - SMD confocal microscope equipped with a hybrid single - molecule detector 504 ( HyD ) and an ultrashort pulsed white - light laser ( WLL ; 50 % ; 1 ps at 40 MHz frequency ) . 505 The Leica Application Suite X was used as a software platform , and imaging was 506 conducted with a HC PL APO CS2 40x / 1 . 20 water immersion objective . The following 507 settings were used : scan speed of 400 Hz , resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels and 508 standard acquisition mode of the hybrid detector . The time - gating system was 509 activated to avoid the autofluorescence emitted from chloroplasts . For the filament 510 growth assay , the imaging dish was applied with FM4 - 64 ( Invitrogen ) solution for 10 - 511 30 mins , and the 10x objective lens was used . 512 For Marchantia observation , gemmae were picked from a gemma cup and 513 transferred into a 24 - well plate with 500 µl liquid 1 / 2 B5 medium . After culturing in the 514 growth chamber for 24 hours , gemmae from each sample were transferred and 515 observed on a slide under Leica Stellaris 8 system with HyD detectors and the 516 ultrashort pulsed white - light laser ( WLL ; 70 % ; 1 ps at 40 MHz frequency ) . The Leica 517 Application Suite X was used as a software platform , and imaging was conducted with 518 an HC PL APO CS2 40x / 1 . 20 water immersion objective . The following settings were 519 used : scan speed of 400 Hz and resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels . For GFP - containing 520 images , a 488nm white light laser was selected , and the detection range was set 521 between 500nm to 525nm . The tau - gating model , harvesting photons with 1 . 0 - 10 . 0ns 522 lifetime , was used for all Marchantia imaging to avoid autofluorescence emitted from 523 the chloroplasts . For the surface section ( rhizoid precursor cell observation ) , a 5 µm - 524 thick section was set using the z - section method with auto - optimization spacing to 525 capture rhizoids’ protrusion . 526 For Arabidopsis root imaging , 4 - day - old seedlings of each indicated genotype 527 were used for fluorescence imaging . After treatment in the liquid MS medium supplied 528 with indicated chemicals , seedlings were carefully mounted on a slice with growth 529 medium and then placed into a chambered coverslip ( Lab - Tek ) for imaging . For the 530 root hair imaging , a 3 µ m Z - projection image with 1 µ m step was taken around the 531 medium plan of the root hair . All fluorescence imaging was performed using a laser 532 scanning confocal microscopy ( Zeiss LSM800 , 20x air lens ) . The default setting for 533 GFP detection was applied with 488nm excitation and 495 - 545nm emission . 534 535 Images quantification 536 All images were analyzed by Fiji ( ImageJ , https : / / imagej . net / software / fiji / ) . For the 537 polarization patterns at the tip of filaments in P . patens , a line with 5 px thickness was 538 plotted along the PM as depicted in Figure 4 and Figure 5 . The representative images 539 for the DMSO control and drug treatments , obtained from the same imaging settings , 540 were used to draw the line , and the mean intensity along the line was shown . For the 541 moss phenotype analysis , mosses bearing inducible PIN - GFP were cultivated in the 542 imaging dish for 5 days , followed by 1 µM β - estradiol induction for another 3 days . The 543 cell outlines were stained with FM4 - 64 for 10 - 30 mins . The line drawing function in Fiji 544 was used to measure the length of subapical cell , and the line was depicted between 545 the middle points of the two cell division planes . The angle measurement function was 546 applied to examine the angle between the first cell division plane and horizontal cell 547 outline for the division angle measurement . 548 549 Genomic DNA isolation 550 The genomic DNA of transformants was isolated by the cetyltrimethylammonium 551 bromide ( CTAB ) gDNA extraction ( Schlink and Reski , 2002 ) . In brief , moss tissues 552 were harvested from one full plate and were ground in liquid nitrogen . The ground 553 tissues were then mixed and were incubated with a CTAB buffer , followed by the 554 addition of chloroform . After centrifugation , the supernatant was collected and was 555 precipitated with isopropanol at - 20°C for one hour . 556 557 Pharmacological treatments 558 To depolymerize microtubules and actin filaments , we used oryzalin ( Sigma ) and 559 latrunculin B ( Sigma ) to treat plants . The concentration and duration of treatment for 560 different plants have been given in numbers , and the conditions we used have been 561 shown to efficiently depolymerize cytoskeletal networks in different species ( Baluska 562 et al . , 2001 ; Baskin et al . , 1994 ; Glanc et al . , 2019 ; Oda et al . , 2009 ; Vidali et al . , 2009 ) . 563 For P . patens , the chemical was diluted in a liquid BCD medium and was applied to 564 the imaging dishes before imaging . 565 For M . polymorpha , G2 gemmae from transgenic plants were transferred into 566 each well of a 24 - well plate containing 500 µl liquid 1 / 2 B5 medium and cultured in the 567 growth chamber for 16 hours . The chemicals were diluted directly into the medium 568 prior to imaging at the time indicated in the text . Based on previous studies , the 569 concentration of Ory ( Era et al . , 2013 ) and LatB ( Otani et al . , 2018 ) were selected . 570 For Arabidopsis , 4 - days - old seedlings were submerged into the liquid MS medium 571 supplied with chemicals and then transferred to another agar medium for imaging . 572 0 . 1 % DMSO ( Duchefa ; 10 mM dimethylsulfoxide ) was used as control for all 573 treatments . 574 575 P . patens auxin export assay 576 The auxin export assay performed with transgenic moss plants was modified based 577 on the protocol developed for Arabidopsis seedlings ( Lewis and Muday , 2009 ) . In brief , 578 7 - days - old fresh tissues were transfer to liquid BCDAT growth medium with 1µM β - 579 estradiol induction for another 4d with gentle shaking , followed by 3 H - IAA treatment 580 with a final concentration of 10 nM for 24 hrs . The radioactive tissues were then 581 washed twice with sterile H 2 O , and were cultivated in fresh BCDAT medium for another 582 24 hrs . The cultivated medium was then collected to mix with ScintiVerse BD cocktail 583 ( Fisher , SX18 - 4 ) in 1 : 30 ( v : v ) , and the export of auxin was measured by the 584 Scintillation counter ( Beckman , LS6500 ) . 585 586 M . polymorpha thallus growth assay 587 G2 gemmae were transferred onto 1 / 2 B5 agar plates and grew for 10 days . Gemmae 588 were imaged under a dissecting microscope ( SZN71 , LiWeng , Taiwan ) with a CCD 589 camera ( Polychrome M , LiWeng , Taiwan ) . For measuring the vertical growth angle , an 590 agar cube with an individual plant was cut out from the plate and placed in the middle 591 of a slide . The slide was put on the surface of a laminar flow at a fixed distance to the 592 edge , and images were taken by an HTC U11 cell phone camera . The growth angle 593 was further measured by using ImageJ ( https : / / imagej . net / software / fiji / ) . 594 595 Phylogenetic analysis 596 The phylogenetic analysis for full length amino acid sequences of all examined PINs 597 was carried out in MEGA X program ( Kumar et al . , 2018 ) and the results were imported 598 into iTOL ( https : / / itol . embl . de / ) for visual illustration . The evolutionary history was 599 inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method and JTT matrix - based model with 600 default settings ( Jones et al . , 1992 ) . The alignment and identity index were produced 601 by online CLUSTAL alignment program with default settings . 602 603 Funding 604 This work was supported by the ERC grant ( PR1023ERC02 ) to H .
