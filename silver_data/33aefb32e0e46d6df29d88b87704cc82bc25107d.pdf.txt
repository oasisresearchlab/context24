Feedback mech - anismsunderlyingtheseprocessesandtheirmodulationbysignalingeventsandreciprocalcross - talks remain poorly understood . Here we show that antigen stimulation of mast cells triggers cyclic changes in the concentration of actin regulatory proteins and actin in the cell cortex that can be manifested in either spatial pattern . Recruitment of FBP17 and active Cdc42 at the plasma membrane , leading to actin polymerization , are involved in both events , whereas calcium oscil - lations , whichcorrelatewithglobal ﬂ uctuations of plasmamembrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , are tightly linked to standing oscillations and counteract wave propagation . These ﬁ ndings demonstrate the occurrence of a calcium - independent oscillator that controls the collective dynamics of factors linking the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane . Coupling between this oscillator and the one underlying global plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and calcium oscillations spatially regu - lates actin dynamics , revealing an unexpected pattern - rendering mechanismunderlyingplasticchangesoccurringinthecorticalregionofthecell . curvature | pattern formation | plasticity | GTPase | frequency A ctin waves have emerged as important cell oscillators that may impact cell polarity ( 1 , 2 ) , motility ( 3 – 6 ) , and division ( 7 ) . Another prominent example of rhythmic cell activity is the oscillations of cytosolic calcium , a second messenger that has also been implicated in these actin - dependent processes , although its precise involvement remains debated ( 8 – 11 ) . Calcium oscillations are most strikingly observed in excitatory or secretory cells , but can occur in all cells in response to hormones or growth factors stimulation ( 12 ) . Though such oscillations provide an attractive mechanism to encode information with frequency and amplitude ( 13 , 14 ) , calcium oscillation - speci ﬁ c functions remain elusive , partially because of the dif ﬁ culty in dissecting the effects of cal - cium oscillations from those due to sustained calcium elevations . Considering that rhythmic changes of actin and calcium are likely to have overlapping function in the regulation of fundamental cellular events , here we have investigated their potential coupling in mast cells , a model system where stimulus - evoked changes in cytosolic calcium and actin dynamics have been extensively docu - mented ( 15 ) . We report the occurrence of both actin waves and actin oscillations in an activity - dependent manner , and the cou - pling of actin oscillations but not of waves with calcium oscillations . Our results suggest that calcium oscillations , rather than elevation of calcium levels per se , are key factors responsible for the con - version of actin waves into actin oscillations . Thus , calcium oscil - lations , coupled to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 oscillations , can be used speci ﬁ cally to regulate actin dynamics . Results and Discussion Oscillations and Waves of FBP17 , Actin , and Cdc42 . We ﬁ rst charac - terized the dynamic actin rearrangements elicited by multivalent antigen cross - linking of Fc receptors on the mast cell surface . Cortical actin in mast cells is represented by a thick and dense network of actin bundles ( 16 ) . To capture events proximal to assembly sites at the plasma membrane , we imaged FBP17 , a potent membrane - associated activator of N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization ( 17 – 19 ) , by total internal re - ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) . Antigen stimulation produced a striking appearance of FBP17 hotspots in the eva - nescent ﬁ eld either as recurring waves of hotspots ( Fig . 1 A and B ; Movie S1 ) or as oscillations ( Fig . 1 C and D ; Movie S2 ) . The propagation of the waves was due to the sequential formation of new spots at the front of the cluster and disappearance at the back ( Fig . 1 B ) , with the center of mass of the cluster moving at an average speed of 0 . 87 μ m / s ( n = 70 ) and a maximum speed of 1 . 8 μ m / s . During oscillations , hotspots also formed and disassembled sequentially , but the centers of mass of the hotspot ensemble were relatively stationary ( Fig . 1 D ) . Strictly speaking , oscillations were in fact oscillatory standing waves , although to avoid confusion be - tween the two events , we refer to them as standing oscillations . The periodicity of the two patterns were comparable , with cycles of 29 . 4 ± 5 s ( n = 12 ) or 31 . 4 ± 4 . 4 s ( n = 16 ) for standing oscillations and traveling waves , respectively . Oscillations and waves were also observed for actin , as reported both by LifeAct - EGFP ( Fig . 2 A and C ; Movie S3 ) and EGFP - N - WASP ( Fig . 2 B ) . These cyclic changes did not require the over - expression of FBP17 but were dependent of the polymerization of actin . Addition of latrunculin , which blocks actin polymerization , to cells with traveling waves completely abolished wave propa - gation ( Fig . 2 D ; Movie S3 ) . Antigen stimulation in the presence of latrunculin also failed to trigger oscillations or waves ( Fig . S1 A ) . Thus , although the peak of actin was delayed by ∼ 3 – 6 s compared with that of FBP17 ( Fig . 2 C ) , an actin - dependent positive feedback mechanism was required for pattern initiation and propagation . Biochemical studies have demonstrated the activation of the small GTPase Cdc42 in mast cells in response to antigen stim - ulation ( 20 ) . Cdc42 is a key regulator of actin dynamics , whose reported effectors in mediating such regulation include N - WASP and the FBP17 homologs Toca1 ( 21 ) and CIP4 ( 22 ) . We have now demonstrated that FBP17 as well is a Cdc42 effector , be - cause puri ﬁ ed FBP17 binds to the active form of Cdc42 , i . e . , to GTP γ S - bound Cdc42 or to a constitutively active Cdc42 mutant ( Fig . 2 E ) . Thus , we examined whether the activation of Cdc42 in response to stimulation occurred in pulses . TIRFM analysis of a ﬂ uorescent activity sensor of Cdc42 ( 23 ) revealed that antigen stimulation of mast cells induced the rapid translocation of this Authorcontributions : M .

Importantly , waves of active Cdc42 over - lapped with FBP17 waves both temporally and spatially ( Fig . 2 G ; Movie S4 ) , although the appearance of the ﬂ uorescence within the waves was diffuse for Cdc42 and punctate for FBP17 . These ﬁ ndings strongly support a role of transient local activation of Cdc42 in facilitating the recruitment and polymerization of FBP17 at the plasma membrane . Oscillations but Not Waves Are Coupled to Calcium Oscillations . Stand - ing oscillations of FBP17 were strictly stimulation - dependent . They started as early as minutes after the beginning of the stimulus ( Fig . 3 A ) and were observed up to an hour . In contrast , FBP17 waves occasionally occurred spontaneously without stimuli , although these spontaneous waves had slightly longer periods ( 40 . 6 ± 10 . 5 s , n = 9 ) than stimulus - evoked waves ( 31 . 4 ± 4 . 4 s , n = 16 ; P < 0 . 005 , Student t test . These differences led us to speculate that standing oscillations may require additional factors relative to traveling waves . Antigen stimulation of RBL - 2H3 cells frequently induces cy - tosolic calcium oscillations ( 24 , 25 ) , whose time of onset relative to the stimulus , and duration , are heterogeneous ( Fig . S2 ) . In all cells where FBP17 oscillations occurred ( n = 12 ) , oscillatory cal - cium spikes were also detected , as shown by the calcium sensor GCaMP3 ( 26 ) ( Fig . 3 A ; Movie S5 ) . Fourier transforms of both oscillations revealed a precisely matching frequency component ( Fig . 3 A ) , whereas the phases were roughly anticorrelated ( Fig . 3 C ) . However , the elevation of cytosolic calcium alone was not suf ﬁ cient to induce FBP17 recruitment , and regulated calcium dynamics was required for oscillations of FBP17 . Presence of thapsigargin ( which depleted intracellular calcium stores ) during antigen stimulation completely abolished both calcium oscil - lations and FBP17 oscillations ( Fig . S1 B ) . Calcium oscillations often started after a broad and prolonged calcium peak due to depletion of intracellular stores ( Fig . 3 A ) , but this initial calcium elevation did not induce FBP17 recruitment ; rather , in many cases , this corresponded to a decrease in the FBP17 intensity ( Figs . 3 A and 4 ) . In addition , the rise and fall of the FBP17 signal during each oscillation occurred when calcium level remained in the baseline ( Fig . 3 C ) . These ﬁ ndings suggested that calcium itself was unlikely to be the rate - limiting step in the regulation of the FBP17 oscillations , and that factors linking both calcium and FBP17 may be responsible for their identical frequency . Calcium oscillations can be coupled with oscillations of IP 3 via a feedback loop that involves the calcium - dependent hydrolysis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by phospholipase C ( 12 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which is con - centrated in the plasma membrane , plays a major role in the recruitment and activation at this membrane of actin regulatory proteins and thus in actin nucleation ( 27 ) ; it is also thought to have a direct role in the membrane recruitment of FBP17 ( 17 , 18 ) . To determine whether PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 links calcium spikes to FBP17 oscillations , levels of this phosphoinositide in the plasma membrane were monitored by TIRFM using mRFP - PH PLC δ , a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 reporter . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 started to oscillate after an anti - gen stimulation - dependent initial PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 drop . This initial drop was shown to be due to the activation of phospholipase C ( 28 ) , which is consistent with an absence of FBP17 recruitment in this initial phase of stimulation . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 oscillations were cell - wide ( Fig . 3 B ) and anticorrelated with calcium oscillation , Fig . 1 .

Thus , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 may represent a key upstream factor that coordinates calcium and FBP17 / actin oscillations . Though calcium oscillations with matching frequencies were observed in all cells with FBP17 oscillations ( n = 12 ) , demon - strating a tight coupling between the two processes , they only occurred in 21 % of the cells with FBP17 waves ( 5 of 24 cells ) . Of the other cells in this group ( n = 19 ) , 53 % had no detectable calcium ﬂ uctuations ( n = 10 ; e . g . , Fig . S3 A and B before stim - ulation ) and 47 % had intermittent and weak calcium pulses whose frequencies did not match those of the FBP17 waves ( n = 9 ; e . g . , Fig . S3 B after stimulation ) . This lack of strong coupling between calcium oscillations and traveling waves of FBP17 adds further evidence for the lack of a direct cause – effect relationship between levels of cytosolic calcium and FBP17 recruitment to the cell cortex . Consistent with the dissociation between traveling waves and calcium oscillations , there were no global PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 oscillations or local PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 waves ( as detected by the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 reporter mRFP - PH PLC δ ) in cells with traveling waves . Dynamic turnover of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , resulting in changes too shallow to be revealed by mRFP - PH PLC δ , may occur at waves , likely coordinated by cycles of phosphorylation / dephosphorylation by PI4P 5 - kinases and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phosphatases , respectively . Importantly , however , the feedback loop involving FBP17 , Cdc42 , and actin can apparently act independently from that controlling cell - wide calcium oscil - lations , which involves the activation of phospholipase C and results in detectable PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 oscillations ( Fig . 5 ) . Interconversion Between Oscillations and Waves . To determine whether these different actin dynamic spatial patterns ( oscil - lations and waves ) re ﬂ ect heterogeneity of the cell population or differential activity states of the cell , we examined if they can interconvert within the same cell . Cells that displayed spontane - ous FBP17 waves with little or no calcium pulses were stimulated with antigen , to elicit calcium / PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 oscillations . In cells that generated robust calcium oscillations ( Fig . 4 A ) , FBP17 waves became synchronized into a cell - wide standing oscillatory pattern after a brief pause ( Fig . 4 B ; Movie S6 ) .

S3 A and B , respectively ) , indicating the coupling with calcium oscillations may be necessary for the conversion . A switch of the FBP17 ﬂ uorescence signal from traveling waves to standing oscillations and vice versa could also occur spontane - ously during the poststimulation period ( Fig . S3 C ; Movie S7 ) . When this occurred , bursts of standing FBP17 oscillations cor - related with bursts of calcium oscillations , which were instead absent during periods of FBP17 waves . Thus , robust oscillations of calcium that correlate with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 oscillations appear to convert a traveling wave into a cell - wide standing oscillation . How can the presence of global calcium / PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 oscillations change the dynamic spatial pattern of actin ? During standing oscillations , i . e . , when cell - wide PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 oscillations are ob - served , cyclic changes of FBP17 ﬂ uorescence intensities in the evanescent ﬁ eld ( Fig . 4 C ) were contributed both by oscillation of the punctate signal ( Fig . 4 D ) , re ﬂ ecting cycles of assembly and disassembly of FBP17 hot spots , and by oscillations of the diffuse signal ( Fig . 4 E ) , re ﬂ ecting global FBP17 binding to the mem - brane that correlates with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels . In contrast , only the punctate signal , but not the global diffuse signal , underwent ﬂ uctuations during waves , when the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 signal detectable by mRFP - PH PLC δ does not oscillate . The wave to oscillation transition precisely matched the onset of cell - wide oscillations of the diffuse plasma membrane - associated FBP17 ﬂ uorescence ( Fig . 4 ) . Though both standing oscillations and traveling waves involve coordinated bindings and dissociations of FBP17 , Cdc42 , and actin at the membrane , the directionality of wave propagation may require signi ﬁ cant asynchrony between factors that control assembly ( at the front of the wave ) and factors that control dis - sociation ( at the back of the wave ) ( 29 ) . Such spatially restricted dynamic changes will be overridden by a cell - wide diffuse signal that acts upstream .

Concluding Remarks . Feedback regulatory loops underlying oscil - lations or waves have been increasingly recognized as important factors in the organization of signaling events ( 30 ) . The oscillatory nature of the recruitment and assembly of actin regulatory proteins and actin , via the control of reversible and low - af ﬁ nity interactions , may facilitate the occurrence of adaptive modi ﬁ cations in the actin cortex and the plasma membrane . This plasticity may be particu - larly important following stimulation — an event that involves dra - matic cell shape changes , actin reorganization , regulated secretion , and compensatory endocytosis ( 15 ) . In this context , it is important to note that calcium oscillations induced by stimulation in mast cells and other secretory cells were shown to correlate with oscil - latory bursts of secretion ( 31 – 33 ) . Interestingly , FBP17 is an F - BAR domain - containing protein ( 34 ) that can participate in en - docytosis ( 35 , 36 ) . Though feedback regulatory mechanisms me - diated by Cdc42 activation and actin polymerization are involved in the collective events described here , irrespective of their spatial pattern , they can be coupled to , or decoupled from , those underlying calcium oscillations , resulting in either standing oscillations or traveling waves ( Fig . 5 ) . The integration of dis - tinct oscillatory systems may be of general importance in ﬁ ne - tuning cell plasticity by spatially controlling membrane and cy - toskeleton dynamics . Methods Materials .

GST - FBP17 ( 17 ) was previously described . Cell Culture and Transfection . RBL - 2H3 cells were maintained in monolayer cultures and harvested with trypsin - EDTA ( Life Technologies ) 3 – 5 d after passage . Transient transfections were carried out on cells in suspension using program X - 01 of the Amaxa electroporator ( Lonza ) . After transfection , cells were plated at subcon ﬂ uent densities in 35 - mm Petri dishes with coverglass bottoms ( MatTek ) and sensitized with anti - DNP IgE at 0 . 4 μ g / mL overnight . Typically cells were cultured for 12 – 24 h and washed twice in buffered saline solution [ 135 mM NaCl , 5 . 0 mM KCl , 1 . 8 mM CaCl 2 , 1 . 0 mM MgCl 2 , 5 . 6 mM glucose , 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 4 ) ] containing 1 mg / mL BSA before imaging ; they were subsequently transferred to a homemade heated microscope stage maintained at 37 °C through a bipolar temperature controller ( Har - vard Apparatus ) .

GST fusion proteins ( Cdc42 wt , Cdc42 G12V , and FBP17 ) were bacterially expressed and puri ﬁ ed using Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads ( Amersham Biosciences ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . GST - Cdc42 WT and Cdc42 G12V were eluted from the beads and incubated with fresh beads to reach saturation of the bead capacity . For nucleotide loading , these GST - Cdc42 – loaded beads were incubated in buffer A ( PBS plus 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 ) with 2 . 5 mM GTP , GDP , or GTP γ S at 30 °C for 20 min . Beads were then washed twice with buffer A , and the supernatant was removed . For in vitro binding , the GST tag of FBP17 was removed using PreScission protease ( Amersham Biosciences ) , and fresh beads were used to remove free GST and uncleaved GST - FBP17 . Cleaved FBP17 ( 0 . 5 – 1 mg / mL , 200 μ L ) was incubated with GST - Cdc42 beads loaded with nucleotides in buffer A with 0 . 1 % Triton X at 4 °C for 2 h . Then , beads were washed once with buffer A + 0 . 25 % Triton X and twice with buffer A + 0 . 1 % Triton X . Total protein was eluted with SDS / PAGE sample loading buffer .
