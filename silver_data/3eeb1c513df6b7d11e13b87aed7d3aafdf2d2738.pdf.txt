Pediatricians’ information - seeking be - haviors are not well characterized . The goal of this study was to characterize quantitatively the information - seek - ing behaviors of general pediatricians and specifically compare their use of computers , including digital librar - ies , before and after an educational intervention . Methods . General pediatric residents and faculty at a US Midwest children’s hospital participated . A control ( year 1 ) versus intervention group ( year 2 ) research de - sign was implemented . Eligible pediatrician pools over - lapped , such that some participated first in the control group and later as part of the intervention . The interven - tion group received a 10 - minute individual training ses - sion and handout on how to use a pediatric digital library to answer professional questions . A general medical dig - ital library was also available . Pediatricians in both the control and the intervention groups were surveyed using the critical incident technique during 2 6 - month time periods . Both groups were telephoned for 1 - to 2 - minute interviews and were asked , “What pediatric question ( s ) did you have that you needed additional information to answer ? ” The main outcome measures were the differ - ences between the proportion of pediatricians who use computers and digital libraries and a comparison of the number of times that pediatricians use these resources before and after intervention . Results . A total of 58 pediatricians were eligible , and 52 participated ( 89 . 6 % ) . Participant demographics be - tween control ( N (cid:1) 41 ; 89 . 1 % ) and intervention ( N (cid:1) 31 ; 70 . 4 % ) were not statistically different . Twenty pediatri - cians were in both groups . Pediatricians were slightly less likely to pursue answers after the intervention ( 94 . 7 % vs 89 . 2 % ) ; the primary reason cited for both groups was a lack of time . The pediatricians were as successful in finding answers in each group ( 95 . 7 % vs 92 . 7 % ) , but the intervention group took significantly less time ( 8 . 3 minutes vs 19 . 6 minutes ) . After the intervention , pediatricians used computers and digital libraries more to answer their questions and spent less time using them . Conclusion . This study showed higher rates of phy - sician questions pursued and answered and higher rates of computer use at baseline and after intervention com - pared with previous studies . Pediatricians who seek an - swers at the point of care therefore should begin to shift their information - seeking behaviors toward computer re - sources , as they are as effective but more time - efficient .

D uring physicians’ professional workdays , many clinically important patient care ques - tions arise and go unanswered . 1 – 3 Rates of information needs vary from 0 . 013 to 5 . 044 questions per patient encounter . 4 The information needs of internists , family practitioners , and general practitio - ners have been the most studied . 1 – 3 , 5 – 10 These studies have found that patient care questions can be orga - nized into a limited number of generic question cat - egories and often are related to pharmacy and infec - tious diseases . 2 , 11 – 14 The information needs and seeking behaviors of general pediatricians have not been as well charac - terized . Pediatricians have been included in some studies , but their specific needs have not been char - acterized as a distinct group . Much of the research describing pediatric information needs is disease based or directed toward specific populations . 15 – 17 A recent literature - based needs assessment defined 171 common problems encountered by general pediatri - cians in the United States , which was then used to develop a pediatric digital library on the Internet . 18 Digital libraries are organized collections of digital information , on the Internet , that are built and cu - rated so that visitors can easily answer questions . Information resources at the point of care , includ - ing computers , have a positive impact on physician decision making 19 , 20 at reduced cost . 21 Unfortu - nately , numerous obstacles to using evidence - based information have been identified , 22 but the lack of time is one of the most common . 15 , 19 , 23 Computers , including Medline searching and using the Internet , can be potentially time - efficient , but they have been used infrequently to answer clinical questions in the past . 1 – 3 , 5 – 7 , 9 , 10 , 24 The goal of this study was to characterize quanti - tatively the information - seeking behaviors of general pediatricians and to compare the use of computers , including a pediatric digital library and a general medical library , to seek answers to questions before and after an educational intervention designed to encourage computer use . METHODS A control group versus an intervention group research design was implemented over 2 years ( Fig 1 ) .

Copyright © 2004 by the American Acad - emy of Pediatrics . 64 PEDIATRICS Vol . 113 No . 1 January 2004 by on February 21 , 2006 www . pediatrics . org Downloaded from dents at The University of Iowa were eligible to participate . Eli - gible pediatrician pools overlapped , such that some participated first in the control group and later as part of the intervention . Although it would have been preferable to have no overlap in the groups , having 20 physicians who experienced the control condi - tion before the intervention should have acted to decrease rather than increase any observed differences . The control condition was designed to gain a measure of any changes that might have occurred by the measurement process alone , whereas the inter - vention condition included the influences of the measurement process and the intervention . Hence , if there were a change cre - ated by the control condition , then one would expect that it would reduce rather than increase the observed differences . The pediatricians worked on the general and subspecialty in - patient wards and outpatient clinics and also provided telephone coverage at night and on weekends . Consent to participate was implied by the pediatricians’ returning of a 6 - question baseline demographic survey that included level of training , amount of computer use , activities for which the computer is used , and attitudes of information source quality and accessibility assessed by Likert scales . The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board . During year 1 ( control group , November 1999 – May 2000 ) , en - rolled pediatricians were surveyed using a modification of the critical incident technique . 25 This was a 9 - question , semistructured telephone survey that we developed and pilot - tested . The main question was , “Think back to last night ( or clinic today ) . What question ( s ) did you have last night ( or today ) for which you needed additional information to answer ? ” Other questions asked included whether an answer to the question was pursued , why it was or was not pursued , was an answer found , what information sources were used , and the amount of time spent answering the question . They were not asked when in the process of patient care the answer was sought . A pediatrician’s question was broadly defined as any professional inquiry that the pediatrician wished to verbalize . The telephone surveys took 1 to 2 minutes to complete , which is similar to other studies ( MH Ebell , JW Ely , personal communication , February 5 , 2003 ) . Trained research assistants telephoned 2 to 6 pediatricians each weekday using a predeter - mined calling list . On the basis of call schedules , the calling list was created monthly by 1 researcher ( D . M . D . ) . Pediatricians were contacted after being on call or at spaced intervals throughout the month . A pediatrician could be contacted up to 3 times per month . The pediatricians were unaware when they would be contacted . During year 2 ( intervention group , December 2000 – May 2001 ) , enrolled pediatricians received a 10 - minute personalized train - ing session on how to use a pediatric digital library ( www . generalpediatrics . com ) to answer professional questions that might arise during a workday . GeneralPediatrics . com uses a prob - lem - based organization to link to authoritative professional and layperson information on the Internet that is not otherwise or easily obtainable . In the training sessions , the pediatricians were given a general overview and then guided though the contents of the digital library using sample questions from specific examples gathered during the baseline evaluation ( eg , “Is this anemia caused by iron deficiency ? ” “Which tests do I order to find out ? ” ) They were also shown site - wide navigation such as accessing searching functions or navigating between similar information on the professionals’ and patients’ pages . The pediatricians could ask questions at anytime . All information that was included in a 1 - page handout that summarized the training session was in - cluded in the training , plus any other additional information requested . A tour of the pediatric digital library has been adapted from these training sessions ( www . generalpediatrics . com / Tour . html ) . The pediatricians were again surveyed using the same telephone survey instrument . The intervention group also had MDConsult ( www . mdconsult . com ) , a general medical digital li - brary , freely accessible to them through the institution . It was not available to the control group . MDConsult offers online use of several paper - based medical textbooks , including Nelson’s Text - book of Pediatrics 26 and the Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases . 27 MDConsult’s availability was publicized to the inter - vention group through institutional electronic and paper mailings . Personal training sessions and online help were also offered to MDConsult users by the institution . The demographic and telephone survey forms were then coded using a predetermined coding schema into a Microsoft Excel database . Physicians’ questions were entered verbatim . Statistical analysis was performed using SAS statistical software ( SAS Insti - tute Inc , Cary , NC ) and included frequencies , (cid:1) 2 and 2 - tailed t tests , and Wilcoxon rank sum tests with (cid:2) set at 0 . 05 . RESULTS A total of 58 pediatricians were eligible , and 52 participated ( 89 . 6 % ; 41 residents and 11 faculty ) . The control group participation rate was 89 . 1 % ( number eligible to participate : 46 ) , and the intervention group rate was 70 . 4 % ( number eligible to participate : 44 ) . Eligible pediatrician pools overlapped with 20 pediatricians in both groups . The 2 groups did not differ by level of training , self - reported computer use , attitudes regarding information source quality and accessibility , or work locations ( P (cid:1) . 7469 ) . Fig 1 . Schema of study design . ARTICLES 65 by on February 21 , 2006 www . pediatrics . org Downloaded from A total of 808 telephone contacts were made ; 607 pediatrician questions were gathered from those con - tacts . There were 320 questions in the control group ( 52 . 7 % ) and 287 questions in the intervention group ( 47 . 3 % ) . The number of questions per telephone con - tact ranged from 0 to 5 . The range of total questions reported by a pediatrician was 0 to 33 . The questions came from inpatient wards ( 58 . 8 % ) , outpatient clinics ( 28 . 7 % ) , telephone calls ( 9 . 1 % ) , and other venues ( 3 . 4 % ) . The pediatricians pursued answers to 559 ques - tions ( 92 . 1 % ) . The control group pursued answers to 94 . 7 % questions , and the intervention group pursued answers to 89 . 2 % questions ( P (cid:1) . 0124 ) . The pedia - tricians pursued answers for patient care ( 81 . 4 % ) , their own learning ( 9 . 3 % ) , curiosity ( 4 . 1 % ) , and to answer someone else’s question ( 3 . 2 % ) . They did not pursue answers because of inadequate time ( 75 % ) and resource inconvenience ( 8 . 3 % ) . The pediatricians were successful in finding an answer 94 . 4 % of the time . The control group was successful 95 . 7 % of the time , and the intervention group was successful 92 . 7 % of the time ( P (cid:1) . 13 ) . The pediatricians were asked whether finding an answer affected care of the patient whom they were seeing . Pediatricians believed that finding an answer af - fected that patient’s care 71 . 8 % of the time , whereas 25 . 9 % believed that it did not affect care ; there was no significant differences between the groups ( P (cid:1) . 89 ) . Overall , the pediatricians spent an average of 14 . 4 minutes per question pursuing an answer ( standard deviation [ SD ] : 32 . 3 ) . The control group spent an average of 19 . 6 minutes ( SD : 41 . 6 ) , and the interven - tion group spent an average of 8 . 3 minutes ( SD : 12 . 8 ) . With the use of the Wilcoxon rank sum test , the difference between the groups was statistically sig - nificant ( P (cid:2) . 001 ) . Pediatricians averaged 1 . 2 resources used per question , or a total of 738 resources for all questions . The information resources are shown in Table 1 . The number of distinct resources was not calculated as a resource could be 1 or more people and names were not asked . Informal consultations with faculty , hand - books , textbooks , and computer resources were the most common resources used by both groups . Sta - tistical testing of differences between the control and intervention groups was conducted for the 3 major categories ( people , paper , and computers ) . Comput - ers were used 14 . 5 % of the time by the control group and 21 . 1 % of the time by the intervention group , demonstrating a statistically significant increase in computer use ( P (cid:1) . 0446 ) . In addition , the interven - tion group used paper - based resources less often ( P (cid:1) . 001 ) . Overall , pediatricians were as successful using a computer to find answers as using other information resources ( P (cid:1) . 6782 ) . The mean number of minutes spent per question using each information resource is shown in Table 2 . Overall , formal consultations , Medline searches , and textbooks took the most time , whereas using a hand - book or MDConsult took the least time . The average time required to answer questions using both paper and computer resources was less in the intervention group ( P (cid:1) . 04 and P (cid:1) . 01 , respectively ) . DISCUSSION Pediatricians’ information needs and information - seeking behaviors are not well characterized . After a Medline search ( 1966 to present ) , this is the first study that begins to describe objectively pediatri - cians’ information - seeking behaviors . The goal of this study was to characterize quantitatively the in - formation - seeking behaviors of general pediatricians and to compare the use of computers , including a pediatric digital library and a general medical li - brary , to seek answers to questions before and after an educational intervention designed to encourage computer use . Our study had a higher rate of physicians re - porting pursuing and answering questions when compared with internists , family practitioners , and TABLE 1 .

Previous studies have shown that rates of questions elicited , pursued , and answered vary by study participants , the definition of a question , and the investigational methods used . 4 , 9 , 28 Practitioner motivation for pursuing or not pursuing questioning has also been explored . 6 Direct observation and self - reporting studies have found that between 36 % and 82 % of clinical questions are pursued and 54 % to 88 % are answered . 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 Ebell and White ( unpublished data ) found that compared with directly observed questions , the number of self - reported physician questions was lower , but the questions had similar success rates and content com - position . The present study included resident physi - cians who have less clinical experience and would need to look up answers more often than practicing pediatricians . It seems likely that our sample , con - taining a range of pediatrician experience levels , may have displayed heterogeneous information needs . For example , faculty in this study reported having fewer total questions on average than the residents ( 6 . 3 vs 9 . 2 ; data not shown ) . Unfortunately , the sub - group sample size precluded testing a hypothesis related to information seeking and level of experi - ence . More than half of the questions also came from inpatient wards , where the patient acuity and imme - diacy requiring answers may be higher ; these rea - sons may account for the higher rate of pursued and answered questions . Pediatricians believed that finding an answer af - fected that patient’s care 71 . 8 % of the time . Those questions not considered important to a patient’s care may have been more general ( eg , What are the components of Larson’s syndrome ? What is the sur - gical technique for X ? ) and therefore were sought for personal learning rather than in reference to a spe - cific patient . The pediatricians used a wide variety of resources to answer their questions . The pediatricians report using paper resources the most frequently in both groups . After the intervention , there is a diminution of paper resource usage and a significant increase in computer usage ( from 14 . 5 % to 21 . 1 % ) . Ely et al 2 reported for family practitioners that paper resources are most commonly used for answering questions ( 57 % ) , and people and computers account for 36 % and 2 % , respectively . This is similar to other studies of internists , family practitioners , and general prac - titioners in which computer resources comprise only a small percentage of the resources used . 1 – 3 , 5 – 7 , 9 , 10 , 24 Reasons for the increased computer use are probably multifactorial , including that resident pediatricians are younger than other populations studied and therefore are more facile with using computers ; that computer and Internet resources are more ubiqui - tous than in the past ; and that during the 2 years of the present study , the pediatricians gained experi - ence and success in using computers and digital libraries to answer questions and therefore used them again subsequently . The pediatricians may also have gotten busier during the study period and therefore had less time to pursue answers to ques - tions regardless of the resource used . This may ex - plain why after the intervention the physicians pur - sued questions less often and paper - based efficiency also increased . Overall , digital library use ( GeneralPediatrics . com and MDConsult ) went from 0 . 8 % to 11 % after the intervention , with both digital libraries having sta - tistically significant increases . We believe that the availability of MDConsult may have decreased the observed use of GeneralPediatrics . com because it contained familiar information resources and was easier to access . MDConsult being a general medical digital library offers several well - known paper - based pediatric textbooks . Using MDConsult may indicate a trend in which pediatricians are using familiar resources in a new way via online access . GeneralPediatrics . com provides access to informa - tion that is not available or not easily obtainable in paper , and the resource offerings may be less famil - iar to the pediatricians despite the training . Finally , accessing MDConsult was much easier for the pedi - atricians as it was integrated into their electronic TABLE 2 .

ARTICLES 67 by on February 21 , 2006 www . pediatrics . org Downloaded from medical record system , which many of the pediatri - cians remained logged into throughout their clinical day . Accessing GeneralPediatrics . com required an additional log - in beyond logging into the electronic medical record system , because of an institutional policy of monitoring and attempting to limit individ - ual usage of the Internet . We believe that the training that the pediatricians received showcased how a pe - diatrician could use a computer to answer clinically relevant questions in a time - efficient manner regard - less of the resource used . There are a number of barriers to answering clin - ical questions . A recent study cited 59 different ob - stacles , with inadequate time to search for informa - tion being one of the most important . 22 Other studies have shown similar results . 1 , 19 , 22 One study reported that 12 minutes was the average time spent seeking information to a single question . 5 Another study that found MEDLINE searches took 27 minutes and text - books took 5 minutes . 29 Our study also found that inadequate time was the major reason that questions were not pursued . The intervention group spent less time pursuing questions , with computers having the greatest time decrease ( 28 . 8 minutes vs 6 . 6 minutes ) . Success at finding answers was the same as for other information resources , but computer resources in - cluding digital libraries were more time efficient . Computers are not a panacea . However , they can systematically and quickly search through large vol - umes of information with searches easily refined and resubmitted . For pediatricians to practice optimally , they need authoritative information resources to be as convenient as coatpocket handbooks . The devel - opment of digital libraries designed for pediatri - cians’ information needs , coupled with continuous Internet access computer technologies , should allow pediatricians to have information resources inte - grated into their workflow at the point of care . The ultimate beneficiaries are the children and families who look to their pediatricians to provide quality health care . Limitations of this study include the selection of pediatricians from a single academic center and the reliance on reported rather than observed behavior . Pediatricians in a community setting may display different information - seeking behaviors , and these results may not be generalizable to these settings . An ongoing study that includes community pediatri - cians may allow direct comparisons with the present results . ( John W . Ely , personal communication , Feb - ruary 5 , 2003 ) . Rates of questions elicited , pursued , and answered vary by the definition of a question and the investigational methods used . 9 The Haw - thorne effect ( a distortion of research results caused by the response of subjects to the special attention that they receive from researchers 30 ) by participating in a research study and receiving any intervention may have caused the pediatricians either to discount questions as being unimportant or to add value to other questions . We found that the time required to answer a question using both computer and paper resources was less in the intervention group . If the intervention had an impact on efficiency , we ex - pected it to be displayed in the computer - but not the paper - based resources , so it is uncertain why paper - based efficiency went up in the intervention group . CONCLUSIONS This study showed higher rates of physician ques - tions pursued and answered and higher rates of computer use at baseline and after intervention com - pared with previous studies . Pediatricians who seek answers at the point of care therefore should begin to shift their information - seeking behaviors toward computer resources , as they are as effective but more time - efficient . As point - of - care information access is improved through deployment of wireless networks and computers and an increased number of com - puter information resources become available , this behavior change should become easier and more widespread for pediatricians in all venues . It is hoped that the ultimate result will be improved pa - tient care . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was supported by Robert Wood Johnson Generalist Faculty Scholars Grant ( 036813 ) .

Accessed June 24 , 2002 OBESITY EPIDEMIC AMONG PETS “A major survey , the National Companion Animal Study , supported by Hills Pet Nutrition and conducted by researchers at Hills and the veterinary college of the University of Minnesota , gathered information on 31 484 dogs and 15 226 cats in 52 private veterinary practices in 1995 . . . . Dr Kirk said that reports of body condition collected in the study showed 28 to 30 % of all animals were overweight . For middle - aged animals , from 4 to 7 years old , however , one out of every two were overweight . Researchers at Purina say that their private surveys of vets suggest that 50 % of pets are overweight . . . . Dr Christine Storts , a veterinarian , said , ‘Rarely do we see an animal that is at the right weight . I think obesity in dogs and cats is an extension of obesity in people . ’” Gorman J .
