Altogether , this work provides major insights into the molecular mechanisms driving membrane deformation in a cellular context . Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs proteins | Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein - interacting protein | amphiphysin | huntingtin interacting protein B udding of transport intermediates from cellular membranes is an energetically unfavorable process that involves a variety of molecular machines . Protein coats , membrane - sculpting domains such as ENTHs ( epsin N - terminal homology ) and BARs ( Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ) , enzymes that translocate or modify lipids , actin nucleating promoting factors ( NPFs ) , and molecular motors par - ticipate in membrane deformation ( 1 ) . Much information has been learned about how these proteins function in vitro . However , little is known about how they effectively bend the lipid bilayer in vivo . Clathrin and actin - dependent endocytic budding from the plasma membrane ( PM ) is one of the best - characterized mem - brane traf ﬁ c events , which requires more than 30 proteins ( ref . 2 and references therein and ref . 3 ) . A comprehensive description of the sequence of events leading to the generation of endocytic vesicles was ﬁ rst elucidated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Fig . 1 A ) . Live - cell ﬂ uorescence microscopy in yeast has shown that cla - thrin and the early module composed of the scaffolding protein Ede1 / Eps15 and the F - BAR ( FCH - BAR ) protein Syp1 / FCHO1 / 2 ( Fer / Cip4 homology domain only proteins 1 and 2 ) are the ﬁ rst to arrive at the endocytic sites ( 4 – 10 ) . Up to 90 s later , the in - termediate coat module formed by the yeast epsins Ent1 / 2 and the HIP1R ( huntingtin interacting protein - related ) homolog Sla2 is recruited to the patch ( 4 , 9 , 11 , 12 ) . The late coat components , such as the clathrin adaptor Sla1 , and the NPFs Las17 / WASP ( Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ) and Pan1 immediately fol - low ( 9 , 11 , 13 ) . Actin polymerization is initiated a few seconds later ( 11 ) on arrival of Bzz1 / syndapin and Vrp1 / WIP ( WASP - interacting protein ) , two proteins that modulate the activity of the NPFs ( 13 ) . After an initial stage of actin - dependent corralled motility , the endocytic coat initiates a slow movement into the cytosol , which re ﬂ ects the elongation of a tubular invagination capped by a hemispherical clathrin coat ( 11 , 14 – 16 ) . Initiation of the inward movement coincides with the recruitment of the third NPF , the myosin - I Myo5 , and initiation of massive actin poly - merization ( 11 , 13 , 14 , 17 ) . Arrival of the amphiphysins Rvs161 / 167 precedes scission of the vesicles , which travel rapidly into the cytosol while still attached to actin ( 4 , 18 , 19 ) . The myosin - I ATPase and actin nucleating promoting activity ( NPA ) are es - sential to power the slow inward movement of the coat , which also requires the NPA of Las17 . In addition , Las17 and Pan1 play a function earlier in the process ( 13 , 14 ) . The need for different NPFs and their exact role in the process are not well - understood . Fluorescence live - cell imaging has established the basis for the molecular models explaining clathrin and actin - dependent en - docytosis ( 20 – 22 ) . However , the resolution offered by the most sophisticated versions of this technique is insuf ﬁ cient to detect changes in the morphology of the lipid bilayer coupled to the dynamics of endocytic proteins ( 23 , 24 ) . Thus , for instance , it is unknown when membrane curvature emerges with respect to the recruitment of endocytic factors . Quantitative immuno - EM ( QIEM ) has shown that the primary endocyticpro ﬁ les in yeastaretubular invaginations of up to 180 nm in length ( 16 ) . Statistical analysis of the length of the invaginations labeled for different proteins shows that early endocytic factors are signi ﬁ cantly more represented in the shortest invaginations com - pared with the late components , indicating that the length of the invagination can be used as a parameter to describe its age ( 16 ) . In this work , we use QIEM to introduce the temporal dimension to the ultrastructural study of endocytic budding . Combined statisti - cal analysis of parameters de ﬁ ning the shape of the endocytic pro ﬁ les and the localization of immunogolds labeling 18 key en - docytic proteins builds up a comprehensive and dynamic map of the endocytic machinery coupled to membrane deformation , with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution . In addition , we inves - tigate the morphology of endocytic pro ﬁ les after interfering with key pieces of the endocytic machinery . Altogether , our data de ﬁ ne the time window when membrane curvature ﬁ rst appears with re - spect to the recruitment of endocyticproteins and showthat actinis required to elongate the incipient invaginations but not initially bend the lipid bilayer . Strikingly , we also ﬁ nd that clathrin does not play an essential structural role to maintain the cohesion of the endocytic coat in yeast or shape the endocytic invaginations . Finally , we show that constriction and growth of the endocytic Author contributions : F . - Z . I . and M . I . G . designed research ; F . - Z . I . performed research ; M . I .

Results and Discussion Initial Bending of the PM Does Not Require Actin or Clathrin Poly - merization and Coincides with the Recruitment of Vrp1 and Bzz1 . We have previously used QIEM to describe the localization of immunogolds labeling nine endocytic proteins along PM invagi - nations of increasing length ( 16 ) . In that study , images of immu - nogolds labeling each endocytic protein were acquired under transmission electron microscope , and the length of the associated invaginations ( IL ) was recorded ( 16 ) . Statistical comparison of the average IL for each protein showed that this parameter can be used to describe the age of the endocytic pro ﬁ le ( 16 ) . Here , we used this approach to de ﬁ ne when membrane curvature emerges with respect to the recruitment of the endocytic factors . We rea - soned that proteins with similar disassembly dynamics recruited at different time points before or at emergence of membrane cur - vature should have similar IL distributions ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 A ) . However , this parameter should signi ﬁ cantly increase for proteins sequentially recruited during the elongation of the pro ﬁ les ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 A ) . We extended our analysis to a total of 18 proteins to cover the complete time window of endocytic budding ( Fig . 1 A ) . The factors analyzed in the current work included the components of the early module Ede1 and Syp1 ( 6 – 8 , 10 ) ; Ent1 / 2 and Sla2 , which arerecruitedafter clathrinand slightlybefore Sla1 , Pan1 , and Las17 ( 4 , 9 , 11 , 12 ) ; Bzz1 and Vrp1 , which arrive about 10 s later ( 13 ) ; and ﬁ nally , the Arp2 / 3 complex , Sac6 , and Cap1 , which arerecruited with actin and disassembledafter theendocytic patch has moved inside the cell ( 4 , 11 , 17 , 19 ) ( Fig . 1 A ) . Ultrathin sections from chemically ﬁ xed yeast expressing HA - tagged versions of these proteins were prepared and labeled with a monoclonal anti - HA and gold - labeled secondary antibodies ( immunogolds ) . Images from 120 immunogolds in association with PM invaginations were collected for each protein ( Fig . 1 B ) , and the IL was measured for every immunogold ( Fig . 1 C ) . In addition , a number of parameters describing the position of the immunogold with respect to the invagination were recorded for ulterior analysis ( Fig . 1 C ) . Statistically signi ﬁ cant differences among the IL distribution for different proteins were detected using a general linear model ( GLM ) ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 B ) . All previously examined proteins ( 16 ) were included in the analysis as references after assessing the reproducibility of the method - ology ( Material and Methods ) . The overall comparison of the IL distributions showed a good correlation between the dynamics of the proteins at the endocytic patch ( Fig . 1 A ) and the presence of labeling on invaginations of increasing length ( Fig . 1 D and SI Appendix , Fig . S1 B and C ) . Only small deviations from the expected behavior were detected for Sla2 and Bbc1 ( Fig . 1 D and SI Appendix , Fig . S1 B and C ) ( 16 ) , B A IL = Invagination length GDPM = gold distance to PM GDLB = gold distance to lipid bilayer GDIT = gold distance to IT GDIT = GDPM – IL GRP = gold relative position GRP = GDPM / IL C AC T I N S C I SS I O N M Y O / W A SP C O A T E AR L Y D * * * * * * * * * Scission Early Coat Myo / WASP Actin IL 100 50 IL < 100 IL < 50 Fig . 1 . The invagination length can be used as a parameter to de ﬁ ne the age of the endocytic pro ﬁ les . ( A ) Proposed cortical dynamics of endocytic proteins included in the current statistical analysis based on or inferred from live - cell imaging ( ref . 2 and references therein ) . The proteins are grouped in modules ( 4 , 7 ) represented in different colors . The timing of clathrin recruitment with respect to the early module is not well - de ﬁ ned ( 4 – 10 ) . The exact time at which the Arp2 / 3 complex is recruited with respect to other endocytic proteins is controversial ( 13 , 17 ) . Yeast proteins and their respective mammalian homologs are shown in bold and regular types , respectively . Time 0 corresponds to scission ( 18 ) .

Interestingly , Vrp1 , which is recruited ∼ 20 s before scission and halfway between the latest coat com - ponents and the actin module ( 13 ) ( Fig . 1 A ) , did not show sig - ni ﬁ cant differences with Sla1 , Pan1 , Ent1 / 2 , Las17 , or clathrin ( Chc1 ) , whereas it signi ﬁ cantly differed from actin ( Act1 ) , Sac6 , Abp1 , and Cap1 ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 B ) . These data indicated that the recruitment of Vrp1 either immediately follows or prompts membrane curvature . Consistent with Bzz1 arriving im - mediately after Vrp1 ( 13 ) , Bzz1 had an IL distribution closest to the IL distribution of Vrp1 ( Fig . 1 D and SI Appendix , Fig . S1 B ) , but it showed more similarities to the actin module ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 B ) . These data framed our study within a time window of maximum 20 s before scission ( Fig . 1 A ) , and they indicate that the clathrin coat remains ﬂ at for up to 90 s after its recruitment to the PM . Because we did not analyze immunogolds associated with ﬂ at PM , events occurring before the recruitment of Vrp1 were nec - essarily invisible to our analysis . In this context , the differences observed for the IL distribution for the early module components Ede1 and Syp1 most likely re ﬂ ected their early departure from the endocytic sites rather than their early arrival ( 6 – 9 ) ( Fig . 1 A and D and SI Appendix , Fig . S1 A and B ) . Bzz1 releases the inhibition imposed on Las17 by Sla1 ( 13 ) , and binding of Vrp1 to Myo5 is essential for the myosin to develop its NPA ( 13 , 25 , 26 ) . To test if actin polymerization triggered by Vrp1 and / or Bzz1 might prompt initial membrane curvature , the en - docytic pro ﬁ les were examined in cells expressing Sla1 - HA treated with either the actin monomer sequestering drug Latrunculin A ( LatA ) ( 27 ) or DMSO . QIEM showed striking differences for the IL distributions of Sla1 - HA in LatA and DMSO - treated cells ( Fig . 2 A – C and SI Appendix , Table S1 ) . Consistent with actin poly - merization sustaining the slow inward movement of the coat ( 11 ) , less than 20 % of the Sla1 - HA labeling was associated with inva - ginations longer than 40 nm in LatA - treated cells compared with 80 % in mock - treated cells ( Fig . 2 C ) . LatA does not preclude as - sembly of the coat at the PM , which was shown by ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( 4 , 5 , 15 ) , but the resolution of this technique is in - suf ﬁ cient to discern the bending state of the underlying mem - brane . Our analysis showed that signi ﬁ cant labeling for Sla1 - HA was associated with shallow invaginations in actin - poisoned cells . They were bona ﬁ de endocytic structures , because they were also labeled with immunogolds against clathrin ( Fig . 2 A ) . These results showed that actin polymerization was critical for growth of the endocytic invaginations , but it was not strictly required to initiate membrane curvature . In agreement , invaginations shorter than 40 nm were poorly labeled for actin and actin - binding proteins compared with the endocytic coat components ( 16 ) ( Fig . 1 D and SI Appendix , Fig . S2 ) . Clathrin polymerization was classically considered a driving force bending the lipid bilayer ( 28 , 29 ) , and its role as a scaffold for cargo adaptors is widely accepted ( 30 ) . We have previously shown that the endocytic coat components , including clathrin , form a 40 - nm hemisphere around the tip of the endocytic inva - ginations ( 16 ) . QIEM analysis of other components of the en - docytic coat module , such as the epsins Ent1 / 2 or the HIP1R homolog Sla2 , also con ﬁ rmed this view . More than 85 % of the immunogolds labeling the coat components were at less than 40 nm from the invagination tip [ GDIT ( gold distance to the in - vagination tip ) < 40 nm ] and had GRPs ( gold relative position ) close to one ( Fig . 1 C , parameter de ﬁ nition , Fig . 3 , and SI Ap - pendix , Fig . S3 and Tables S2 and S3 , GDIT ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that assembly and subsequent bending of the cla - thrin coat might be suf ﬁ cient to generate curvature . To test this hypothesis , we analyzed the morphology of endocytic invagina - tions labeled for Sla1 - HA in chc1 Δ and WT yeast ( Fig . 2 D – F ) . Surprisingly , depletion of clathrin did not signi ﬁ cantly alter the length of the Sla1 - HA – labeled invaginations or their morphology in any other obvious respect ( Fig . 2 D – F ) . Interestingly , the analysis of the different positional parameters ( parameter de ﬁ - nition in Fig . 1 C ) for Sla1 - HA did not reveal major changes in its localization on depletion of clathrin ( SI Appendix , Table S1 ) . This ﬁ nding suggested that clathrin does not play an essential structural role in yeast to de ﬁ ne the morphology or size of the endocytic coat , but rather , it might have a regulatory function ( 4 , 31 , 32 ) . Suf ﬁ cient concentration of membrane - sculpting BAR and ENTH domains held by scaffolding proteins , such as Ede1 , Pan1 , or Sla1 , might be suf ﬁ cient to initiate membrane curvature by steric crowding mechanism ( 33 ) . Initial Actin Polymerization Builds a Branched Actin Network That Caps the Endocytic Coat and Moves with It as the Invagination Elongates . We showed that actin polymerization was not re - quired to sustain initial PM bending , but it was critical for elon - gation of the endocytic invaginations . Accordingly , invaginations longer than 40 nm show signi ﬁ cant labeling for actin ( 16 ) . This D M S O La t A - Sla1 - HA A CHC 1 c h c 1 - Sla1 - HA D - Chc1 B C E F Fig . 2 .

PNAS | Published online September 4 , 2012 | E2589 C E LL B I O L O G Y P N A S P L U S labeling is initially scattered over a dark ribosome - free area about 50 - nm thick that surrounds the endocytic coat . Then , it extends to the neck as the pro ﬁ le elongates , and it ﬁ nally splits into basal and apical pools on invaginations longer than 110 nm ( 16 ) ( Fig . 4 A ) . To gain insight into the architecture of the endocytic actin struc - tures , we analyzed the localization of proteins controlling its or - ganization . These proteins included Sac6 / ﬁ mbrin , which bundles actin ﬁ laments ( 34 ) , the Arp2 / 3 complex , which nucleates and branches actin ( 35 , 36 ) , and Cap1 / capping protein , which binds to the barbed , fast - growing ends of the ﬁ laments and prevents their growth ( 37 , 38 ) . Similar to actin , labeling for Sac6 and Cap1 was scattered around the invagination tip and spread to the base as the pro ﬁ le elongated ( Figs . 3 and 4 A and SI Appendix , Fig . S4 ) . However , no obvious bimodal distribution could be observed for Sac6 or Cap1 in the longest pro ﬁ les ( Fig . 4 A ) . Interestingly , a closer inspection of the labeling pattern for Cap1 indicated that the immunogolds were not randomly distributed , but rather , they seemed to be associated with the rims of the ribosome - free area , the coat , and the base of the invaginations ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5 ) . This Cap1 distribution suggested the presence of actin ﬁ laments with multiple polarities . Similar to other members of the actin module , labeling for Arc15 initially appeared covering the endocytic coat ( Figs . 3 and 4 A ) . However , as the pro ﬁ les elongated , Arc15 did not spread to Fig . 3 . Localization of immunogolds labeling endocytic proteins on PM invaginations of increasing length .

S4 and Table S2 ) . Thus , on invaginations longer than 110 nm , no labeling for Arc15 was detected close to the basal PM ( GRP < 0 . 3 ) , whereas more than 30 % of the actin labeling was found within this area ( Figs . 3 and 4 A and SI Appendix , Table S3 , GRP ) ( 16 ) . Over 90 % of the Arc15 labeling always appeared at less than 70 nm from the in - vagination tip ( GDIT < 70 nm ) ( Fig . 3 and SI Appendix , Fig . S4 C and Table S3 , GDIT ) , suggesting that a cap of branched actin ﬁ laments might initially form , which then moves together with the endocytic coat as the pro ﬁ le elongates . Interestingly , the endocytic coat component Sla2 showed no signi ﬁ cant differences with Arc15 for any of the positional parameters analyzed , in - cluding the distance to the lipid bilayer [ SI Appendix , Table S4 , GDLB ( gold distance to the lipid bilayer ) ] . The immunogolds against Sla2 - HA were , on average , at 22 . 74 ± 17 . 85 nm from the lipid bilayer , similar to the actin - binding proteins and signi ﬁ - cantly different from the coat components , which had a GDLB close to 10 nm ( SI Appendix , Tables S3 and S4 ) . This localization was consistent with the proposed role of Sla2 / HIP1R working as a linker between the endocytic coat and actin ( 32 , 39 , 40 ) . It was proposed that a strong actin network stabilized by the Arp2 / 3 complex and Sac6 and cross - linked to the coat through Sla2 is important for force transduction during membrane invagination ( 20 ) . Consistent with this view , deletion of Sla2 caused a very signi ﬁ cant decrease in the IL ( SI Appendix , Fig . S6 ) . Compared with the WT , sla2 Δ cells accumulated shallow and short invagi - nations surrounded by a thick electron - dense area that was heavily labeled for actin ( SI Appendix , Fig . S6 ) . Translocation of F - BAR Proteins to the Invagination Neck Correlates with Its Constriction . The observation that the Arp2 / 3 complex only occupies the tip of endocytic invaginations longer than 70 nm suggested a possible change in the mechanism of elongation of the pro ﬁ les at this point . Accordingly , we detected important changes in the relative position ( GRP ) of several endocytic proteins at IL 70 nm using the Mann – Whitney Wilcoxon test ( MWW ) test . The most signi ﬁ cant change in the GRP was ob - served for Bzz1 ( SI Appendix , Table S2 ) . Labeling for this protein initially occupied the invagination tip , where it colocalized with the endocytic coat and Las17 ( Figs . 3 and 4 B and SI Appendix , Table S3 , GRP ) . In longer pro ﬁ les , Bzz1 progressively moved to meet Myo5 at the invagination base ( Figs . 3 and 4B and SI Appendix , Figs . S3 and S4 and Table S3 , GRP ) . Interestingly , the MWW test also evidenced the displacement of the other F - BAR protein Syp1 at this point ( SI Appendix , Table S2 ) .

PNAS | Published online September 4 , 2012 | E2591 C E LL B I O L O G Y P N A S P L U S pro ﬁ les ( IL < 70 nm ) , the GRP for Syp1 was close to one , identical to the GRP of the coat protein Sla1 ( Figs . 3 and 4 B and SI Appendix , Table S3 , GRP ) . In longer pro ﬁ les ( IL ≥ 70 nm ) , Syp1 spread to the intermediate area of the invagination , where it colocalized with Las17 ( 16 ) ( Figs . 3 and 4 B and SI Appendix , Fig . S4 C and Table S3 , GRP ) . Although the variation in GRP for Syp1 was milder than the variation observed for Bzz1 , its phys - iological relevance was corroborated by the observation that Ede1 , a protein that physically interacts with Syp1 and shows identical dynamics at the endocytic patch ( 7 , 10 ) , behaved sim - ilarly ( Figs . 3 and 4 B and SI Appendix , Fig . S4 C and Tables S2 – S4 ) . In agreement with the membrane - sculpting activity of F - BAR proteins ( 10 , 41 ) , we observed that their assembly around the invagination neck correlated with the constriction of the pro ﬁ les . Whereas more than 90 % of the invaginations shorter than 70 nm were U - shaped , most of the longest pro ﬁ les exhibited an ω - contour ( Figs . 1 B and 5 A and B ) . Thus , the narrowest diameter along the invagination neck ( D min ) progressively de - creased from 59 . 24 ± 13 . 52 nm ( IL < 60 nm ) to 39 . 79 ± 11 . 44 nm ( IL > 120 nm ) ( Fig . 5 C ) , whereas the diameter at the base of the endocytic coat ( D 40 ) or the level of the basal PM ( D PM ) remained constant ( Fig . 5 C ) . To investigate which BAR protein might promote constriction , we compared their localization . We found that the constriction relative position [ CRP ; CRP = constriction distance to the PM ( CDPM ) / IL ] was 0 . 30 ± 0 . 09 and did not signi ﬁ cantly change as the pro ﬁ le elongated ( Fig . 5 D ) . Comparison of the CRP with the GRP of the BAR proteins indicated maximum coincidence with Bzz1 , especially in the longest pro ﬁ les ( Fig . 5 E and F and SI Appendix , Table S5 ) . However , a signi ﬁ cant pool of Syp1 labeling also concentrated at this position when invaginations were shorter than 110 nm ( Fig . 5 E ) . No obvious overlap with Rvs167 could be detected ( Fig . 5 E and F and SI Appendix , Table S5 ) . Consistent with a role of Syp1 and Bzz1 in the constriction of the invagination neck , we observed that the percentage of ω - shaped pro ﬁ les longer than 70 nm dropped from 71 % in WT cells to 48 % and 45 % in bzz1 Δ and syp1 Δ strains , respectively ( Fig . 5 G and H ) . Further - more , depletion of Syp1 caused a very signi ﬁ cant increase in the D min of invaginations longer than 70 nm ( from 46 ± 12 nm in the WT to 55 ± 15 nm in syp1 Δ cells ) ( Fig . 5 G and I ) . Depletion of Bzz1 had a milder effect on this parameter ( Fig . 5 G and I ) . Myosins - I Are Required for Elongation and Constriction of Endocytic Pro ﬁ les . The rearrangement of endocytic factors observed at IL 70 nm suggested that the Las17 NPA might be inhibited at this point . On invaginations longer than 70 nm , Las17 lost contact with its activator Bzz1 and spread to the neck to meet two inhibitors , Syp1 and Bbc1 ( 8 , 13 , 16 ) ( Fig . 4 B and SI Appendix , Fig . S3 ) ( 16 ) . However , we have previously shown that Myo5 associates with the base of invaginations longer than 50 nm and the tip of pro ﬁ les longer than 110 nm ( 16 ) . To de ﬁ ne which pool of myosin provided the predominant NPA in long pro ﬁ les ( IL > 70 nm ) , we analyzed the position of its coactivator Vrp1 ( 13 ) . Interestingly , Vrp1 exhibited a bimodal distribution , which did not change as the pro ﬁ les elongated ( Figs . 3 and 4 C and SI Appendix , Table S2 , GRP ) . On short invaginations , a signif - icant fraction of the Vrp1 labeling colocalized with the basal Myo5 ( Fig . 4 C ) . On pro ﬁ les longer than 110 nm , Vrp1 and Myo5 showed no signi ﬁ cant difference for any of the positional parameters ( Fig . 4 C and SI Appendix , Table S6 ) . Together with previous observations ( 4 , 13 , 14 , 42 ) , our data strongly suggested that , after an initial burst of actin polymerization induced by Las17 and Pan1 on the endocytic coat , Myo5 / Vrp1 take over to localize the predominant NPA at the base of the pro ﬁ les . In the longest invaginations , a new burst of actin polymerization ignited by Myo5 / Vrp1 on the tip might participate in vesicle ﬁ ssion ( SI Appendix , Fig . S7 ) . In addition to actin polymerization , the myosin - I ATPase is essential to sustain the slow movement of the coat into the cy - tosol ( 13 ) . However , unlike actin polymerization , the molecular motor is most likely not required to sustain the corralled move - ment of the coat observed before the arrival of the myosin ( 13 – 15 , 17 ) . To characterize the corralled vs . slow inward movement and the function of the myosin ATPase at the ultrastructural level , we analyzed the morphology of Sla1 - HA – labeled endocytic pro ﬁ les in a double myosin - I deleted strain ( myo3 Δ myo5 Δ ) expressing either the WT MYO5 or a mutant bearing the E414V substitution in a conserved residue of the ATPase active site ( 43 ) .

The myo3 Δ myo5 - E414V strain accumulated endocytic invaginations of about 70 nm cov - ered by the ribosome - free area ( Fig . 6 A – C ) . The data indicated that building of the actin cap branched by the Arp2 / 3 complex might cause the corralled movement and promote growth of invaginations shorter than 70 nm , whereas the myosin ATPase would be required for farther directed elongation of the pro ﬁ les . Interestingly , we also noticed that the invaginations in the my - osin - I mutant were predominantly U - shaped ( Fig . 6 A ) , in - dicating that either the mechanochemical activity of Myo5 was directly required for the constriction of the invaginations and / or the elongation of the pro ﬁ les powered by the molecular motor was necessary for the F - BAR proteins to translocate to the in - vagination neck . Consistent with the ﬁ rst hypothesis , we found that the basal pool of Myo5 colocalized with the position of the constriction ( MWW , P > 0 . 02 ) . However , consistent with the second possibility , QIEM showed that , unlike Syp1 in the WT strain ( Figs . 1 B and 3 , Syp1 ) , the F - BAR protein failed to move from the tip to the neck of the invaginations in the myosin ATPase mutant ( Fig . 6 D – F ) . Conclusions Altogether , our data provide detailed positional information on 18 proteins coupled to membrane deformation during endo - cytic budding from the PM in a cellular context . Combining immunogold labeling , high - resolution transmission EM , and statistics allowed for description of changes in the membrane topography coupled to the dynamics of endocytic proteins , with a resolution down to 7 nm ( SI Appendix , Tables S3 , GDLB , and S4 , GDLB ) . Such resolution has not yet been reached by emerging techniques using correlative EM and ﬂ uorescence microscopy , which were recently applied to the study of endo - cytic budding in yeast ( 18 ) . Those EM approaches used high - pressure freezing and freeze substitution to ﬁ x yeast , and they probably preserve the ultrastructure of endocytic pro ﬁ les better than chemical ﬁ xation ( 18 , 41 ) . However , immunolabeling of en - docytic structures on these samples is inef ﬁ cient ( 44 ) , and therefore , it is not feasible at the moment to use this technique to apply a statistical analysis of positional parameters describing the dynamics of a comprehensive set of endocytic proteins at the ultrastructural level . Thus , our methodology offers a good com - promise to describe changes in the topography of the lipid bi - layer coupled to the dynamics of endocytic proteins . In any case , our ﬁ xation protocol may slightly distort the endocytic struc - tures , and therefore , care should be taken not to conclude that our measurements exactly re ﬂ ect the morphology of the endo - cytic invaginations and the position of the proteins involved in the budding process . In the future , the use of cryo - EM of vit - reous sections will help de ﬁ ne the exact morphology of the endocytic invaginations . Live imaging studies have been the key to initially de ﬁ ne the functional modules involved in the process , both in yeast and mammals ( 3 , 4 ) . Our ultrastructural analysis has now con ﬁ rmed the existence of some modules at a higher resolution and un - veiled higher levels of complexity for others ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 ) . Thus , we have con ﬁ rmed that the components of the early module or the endocytic coat ( 4 , 12 ) show nearly indistinguish - able behaviors for any of the parameters analyzed in our study ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 and Tables S2 and S4 ) , and therefore , they can also be considered as functional modules at the ultrastruc - tural level . Our analysis has also helped de ﬁ ne their function by describing their dynamics at much higher resolution and cou - pling them to membrane deformation ( Fig . 7 and SI Appendix , Fig . S3 ) . However , we found that the components of the pre - viously de ﬁ ned WASP / Myo and actin modules have a much more complex behavior , which could not be anticipated by other techniques ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 ) . The data presented here provide valuable information regarding when and where physi - ological interactions occur , which signi ﬁ cantly helps to re ﬁ ne the current models explaining the process ( Fig . 7 ) .

Yeast cells were ﬁ xed using 4 % formaldehyde and 0 . 4 % glutaraldehyde and processed for immuno - EM as previously described ( 16 ) . For LatA treatment , cells were concentrated by ﬁ l - tration to 2 × 10 8 cells / mL and then incubated with 200 μ M LatA in DMSO or an equivalent amount of DMSO for 20 min at 26 °C before ﬁ xation . For immunolabeling , anti - HA rat monoclonal antibody 3F10 from Roche or anti - actin rat monoclonal antibody MAC237 ( Abcam ) were used as primary anti - bodies , and 12 - nm gold - conjugated anti - rat IgG antibody ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) was used as secondary antibody . Clathrin la - beling was performed as described ( 16 ) using 20 - nm gold - conjugated anti - bodies . Ultrathin sections were examined using a Tecnai Spirit transmission electron microscope ( FEI Company ) at 120 kV accelerating voltage . Micro - graphs were acquired at 100 , 000 × magni ﬁ cation using a CCD camera ( MegaView III ; Olympus ) and the image acquisition analySIS software ( Olym - pus ) . The speci ﬁ city of the anti - HA labeling on PM invaginations was assessed as described ( 16 ) for the least abundant protein at the endocytic patch ( Las17 ) and the most transiently recruited protein ( Rvs167 ) ( 16 ) . The maximum esti - mated distance from the epitope to the gold particle is 20 – 30 nm ( 45 ) . Statistical Analysis of the Immunogold Distribution . All statistical analyses were performed using SAS System v9 . 2 ( SAS Institute ) . Comparison of proteins with respect to the different parameters describing the position of the immunogolds labeling them was performed using either a nonpara - metric MWW ( 46 ) or a GLM ( 47 ) . To test for the reproducibility of the im - munolabeling patterns , labeling for Abp1 - HA and Sla1 - HA was repeated and compared with previously published data ( 16 ) . Student t tests showed no signi ﬁ cant differences between these data and the published immu - nogold populations for any of the parameters analyzed ( P > 0 . 02 ) , in - dicating that the results are independent of the strain background or the experimental handling . Bins of equal lengths were used to depict the frequency of gold particles according to the invagination length . Cutoffs at 70 and 110 nm were used to depict the changes in the distribution of endocytic proteins along the PM invaginations . The most appropriate cutoffs were de ﬁ ned by comparing the population of immunogolds ac - cording to the GRP that was associated with invaginations of different lengths using the MWW test . The cutoffs showing the most signi ﬁ cant differences were used . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . We thank M . Cid and V . Robles ; M . Pons for technical assistance ; M . Borras and V .
