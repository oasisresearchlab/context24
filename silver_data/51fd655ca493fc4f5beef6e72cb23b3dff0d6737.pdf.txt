In animal models of LGI1 - dependent autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy ( ADTLE ) , Kv 1 channels are downregulated , suggesting their crucial involvement in epileptogenesis . The molecular basis of Kv 1 channel - downregulation in LGI1 knock - out mice has not been elucidated and how the absence of this extracellular protein induces an important modification in the expression of Kv 1 remains unknown . In this study we analyse by immunofluorescence the detailed modifications in neuronal Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 distribution throughout the hippocampal formation of LGI1 knock - out mice . We show that Kv 1 downregulation is not restricted to the axonal compartment , but also takes place in the somatodendritic region and is accompanied by a drastic decrease in Kv 2 expression levels . Moreover , we find that the downregulation of these Kv channels is associated with an important increase in bursting patterns . Finally , mass spectrometry uncovered key important modifications in the Kv 1 interactome that highlight the epileptogenic implication of Kv 1 downregulation in LGI1 knock - out animals . 1 . Introduction The delayed rectifying Kv 1 channels which mediate low voltage - activated K + currents are key regulators of neuronal excitability , affecting action - potential ( AP ) threshold and firing patterns . [ 1 2 3 ] Functional plasticity in neurons involves dynamic changes in the expression and subcellular distribution of potassium channels at distinct neuronal compartments . [ 4 ] Kv 1 channels are formed by homomeric or heteromeric co - assembly of four alpha subunits with auxiliary subunits . [ 4 ] A subset of Kv 1 subunits , namely Kv 1 . 1 3 ( KCNA1 ) , Kv 1 . 2 ( KCNA2 ) and Kv 1 . 6 ( KCNA6 ) are responsible for the  - dendrotoxin (  - DTX ) sensitive D - type current and these Kv subunits are present in axonal and synaptic compartments [ 5 6 ] as well as at axonal initial segments . [ 7 8 ] Gain - or loss - of - function , inherited or de novo missense variants of these subunits lead to neurological disorders which display extensive clinical heterogeneity . [ 9 10 11 12 ] LGI1 is a secreted extracellular glycoprotein 13 which is associated with Kv 1 channels . [ 14 15 16 ] Mutations in the LGI1 gene often result in the inhibition of its secretion [ 13 17 ] which underlies hyperexcitability in Autosomal Dominant Lateral Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ( ADLTE ) . Also , the production of LGI1 - autoantibodies promotes neuronal excitability and epilepsy in LGI1 - dependent autoimmune limbic encephalitis . In both genetic and autoimmune disruption of LGI1 function , a significant decrease in total , as well as plasma membrane , Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 is observed . [ 8 18 19 ] This decrease may underlie the increase in neuronal excitability in ADLTE [ 8 ] and precedes the previously described [ 20 ] perturbation in AMPA / NMDA receptors ratio . [ 21 8 ] An additional secretion - defective LGI1 mutation was recently found to induce Kv 1 . 1 downregulation underlying neuronal hyperexcitability and irregular spiking in the CA1 pyramidal cells . [ 22 ] Although LGI1 is part of the Kv 1 - associated proteome [ 14 15 16 23 ] , how the absence of an extracellular glycoprotein leads to the downregulation of Kv 1 subunits has not yet been elucidated . LGI1 binds to the proteolytically - inactive transmembrane ADAM family members ADAM11 , 22 and 23 [ 24 25 26 ] and Kv 1 is a constituent of the ADAM22 - associated proteome [ 20 ] . While ADAM22 [ 17 ] as well as Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 C - terminal tails , directly interact with PSD95 / 93 via PDZ domains [ 27 ] , the interplay between ADAM , PSD95 / 93 and Kv1 subunits is complex . PSD93 ( DLG2 ) , but not PSD95 ( DLG4 ) [ 28 14 ] nor ADAM22 [ 14 ] , is important for Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 channel localisation and clustering at 4 axonal initial segments . [ 5 ] Also , PDZ interaction domains of Kv 1 are crucial for surface expression but not axonal targeting . [ 6 ] In this study we unveil the molecular mechanisms by which the absence of LGI1 triggers a decrease in the expression and mislocalization of several potassium channels at different cellular loci throughout the hippocampal formation . The use of mass spectrometry uncovered key modifications in the Kv 1 interactome that highlight the epileptogenic implication of Kv1 downregulation . We finally show that complex bursting patterns dominate in Lgi1 - / - CA3 pyramidal neurons , and that this is associated with a substantial decrease in the somatodendritic Kv 2 channels that are known to participate in modulating spike bursting patterns . [ 29 ] 2 . Results 2 . 1 . Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 expression in Lgi1 - / - We have previously shown that Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 subunits were massively downregulated in LGI1 knock - out mice ( Lgi1 - / - ) total brain extracts and that , in this genetic background , Kv 1 . 1 was almost absent from axonal initial segments of hippocampal and cortical neurons [ 8 ] . In the light of the major enrichment of LGI1 in the hippocampal formation [ 23 ] , we compared by Western blot the downregulation level of Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 subunits in total brain homogenate as well as in hippocampal extracts ( Figure 1 and 2 ) . We observed that the decrease in expression of Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 in total brain ( Figure 1a ) ( Kv 1 . 1 WT 1 . 00 ± 0 . 07 vs Kv 1 . 1 Lgi1 - / - 0 . 72 ± 0 . 08 , p = 0 . 047 ; Kv 1 . 2 WT 1 . 00 ± 0 . 05 vs Kv 1 . 2 Lgi1 - / - 0 . 52 ± 0 . 04 , p = 1 . 03 x 10 - 7 ) was less severe than in hippocampus ( Figure 1b , Kv 1 . 1 WT 1 . 00 ± 0 . 05 vs Kv 1 . 1 Lgi1 - / - 0 . 55 ± 0 . 03 , p = 1 . 33 x 10 - 7 ; Kv 1 . 2 WT 1 . 00 ± 0 . 04 vs Kv 1 . 2 Lgi1 - / - 0 . 38 ± 0 . 02 , p = 1 . 73 x 10 - 13 ) . 5 In order to address Kv 1 expression and distribution profile , we investigated , the detailed comparative immunofluorescence staining of Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 in the hippocampal formation in both WT and Lgi1 - / - backgrounds . It is noteworthy that conventional immunohistochemical techniques could render the epitopes of Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 inaccessible to antibodies , especially in slices from prefixed brain , precluding the detection of these channels particularly in the AIS of hippocampal neurons [ 30 ] . In our hands , this proved to be the case , since Kv 1 . 1 was not detected in the absence of antigen retrieval protocols ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information ) . The use of the same antibody on organotypic slices [ 31 ] or using mild fixation conditions in thin slices [ 21 ] could facilitate epitope access . Due to the tortuosity of the AIS in CA3 , we chose to use 50  m thick sections and therefore , employing antigen retrieval techniques [ 32 33 ] and addressed Kv 1 . 1 ( Figure 1c - h ) and Kv 1 . 2 ( Figure 2c - h ) distribution . In addition to the previously reported decrease in Kv 1 expression in the AIS ( Figure 1e and Figure 2e ) , we observed an overall decrease in all hippocampal strata ( CA1 , CA3 and DG ) ( Figure 1c , d , g and Figure 2c , d , g ) with a more prominent decrease of Kv 1 . 2 versus Kv 1 . 1 . Interestingly , we observed that in parvalbumin ( PV ) positive interneurons , the expression levels of both Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 subunits were not affected , ( Figure 1f , h and Figure 2f , h ) suggesting that Kv 1 expression levels in PV + cells are not regulated by LGI1 . 2 . 2 . Characterization of Kv1 . 2 antibodies In order to address changes in Kv 1 . 2 proteome between WT and Lgi1 - / - , we generated a polyclonal antibody directed against a C - terminal peptide sequence and performed immunoprecipitations followed by mass spectrometry analysis . As shown in Figure S2a Supporting Information , this antibody recognizes Kv 1 . 2 from brain extracts as well as 6 recombinant pHLuorin - tagged full length Kv 1 . 2 but not Kv 1 . 1 expressed in HEK cells . However , the band recognized in wild - type mice brain extracts was still present in Kv 1 . 2 knock out extracts ( Figure S2b Supporting Information ) suggesting that this antibody can cross - react , in native tissues , with closely homologous Kv 1 isoforms . Due to the significant sequence homology between the target peptide sequence in other Kv 1 family members ( Figure S3a , Supporting Information ) , we verified whether at higher protein concentrations , the antibody can recognize other Kv 1 family members . As shown in Figure S3b , c Supporting Information , the antibody showed cross - reactivity with GST fusion proteins containing C - terminal sequences of Kv 1 . 1 and to a lesser extent Kv 1 . 3 but not Kv 1 . 4 . These results indicate that depending on the abundance of the Kv 1 isoform , the used antibody can cross reacts with other closely related and significantly homologous Kv 1 family members . 2 . 3 Kv 1 - associated proteome in WT versus Lgi1 - / - brain homogenate The capacity of our antibody to recognize Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 allows us to address the consequences of the absence of LGI1 on the modification of the proteome associated with these hetero - multimeric potassium channels . Kv 1  ( KCNA1 and 2 ) subunits as well as other Kv  1 ( KCAB1 ) and  2 ( KCAB2 ) were equally recovered except Kv 1 . 6 ( KCNA6 ) that was less immunoprecipitated ( - 32 , 8 % ) from Lgi1 - / - extracts ( Table S1 , and Supplementary sheet ) . The comparison between Kv 1 partners in WT and Lgi1 - / - reveals intriguing findings , suggesting a dynamic interplay of protein interactions . Certain partners are lost in the absence of LGI1 , while new partners are acquired , highlighting the remodelling of Kv 1 interaction networks . Furthermore , the analysis indicates that the interaction with specific partners is enhanced , indicating a potential compensatory mechanism , while the association with other partners is diminished . 7 2 . 3 . 1 . Lost Kv 1 partners in Lgi1 - / - samples : The most striking observation was that the landscape of the Kv 1 links with the cytoskeleton shows major rearrangements ( Supplementary Tables 2 , 3 , Figure S4 Supplementary Information and Supplementary sheet ) . The association with ACTC Actin ( alpha cardiac muscle 1 ) , the most abundant Kv 1 partner from WT extracts is lost in the Lgi1 - / - samples . This actin isoform was shown to be widely expressed in the hippocampus and other brain structures . [ 34 ] In addition to actin , the co - immunoprecipitation of myosin 10 and the intermediate filament vimentin as well as the actin remodelling protein CYFP2 ( cytoplasmic FMR1 Interacting Protein 2 also known as PIR12 ) [ 35 36 ] are completely disrupted in Lgi1 - / - . Interestingly , CYFP2 is linked to mTORC signalling [ 37 ] and was shown to be involved in epileptic encephalopathy and intellectual disability . [ 38 ] The perturbations in membrane expression and cytoskeletal links of Kv 1 are also reflected by the loss of interaction of Kv 1 with the following partners : i - the membrane - associated phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate binding protein GSDMA , that has pore forming properties and is involved in cell death [ 39 ] , ii - the deltex E3 ubiquitin - protein ligase and regulator of Notch signalling DTX1 , iii - the multi - modular scaffolding protein RANB9 that is implicated in actin cytoskeletal rearrangement [ 40 ] and the integration of a variety of cell surface receptor signalling through intracellular targets [ 41 ] , iv - The PM / ER cholesterol transporter and phosphatidylserine binding protein [ 42 ] ASTRA that may indicate a change in the lipidic environment of Kv 1 . Although a similar function was attributed to ASTRA and B , the decrease of interaction with Kv 1 is restricted to ASTRA , ASTRB remaining stable , v - the NEB2 ( spinophilin ) [ 43 ] , a PDZ - domain containing F - actin binding and phosphatase recruiter scaffolding protein . NEB2 is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 [ 43 ] that controls serine / threonine dephosphorylation of several membrane proteins such as ion channels and certain G - protein coupled 8 receptors [ 44 ] and is enriched in postsynaptic compartments [ 45 ] where it is involved in modulating spine maturation and morphology . [ 46 ] In accordance with this latter observation , the association of Kv 1 with PP2BB is also lost in Lgi1 - / - samples . PP2BB is a regulatory subunit of the activity - dependent serine / threonine - protein phosphatase calcineurin and plays an essential role in intracellular Ca 2 + - mediated signal transduction . With PP1 , it plays a regulatory role in Kv 2 . 1 ( see later for the description of Kv 2 decrease ) phosphorylation modulating its activity , membrane clustering and internalisation with key effects on the control of neuronal excitability [ 47 44 ] . Interestingly , the interaction of NEB2 with actin is modulated by doublecortin ( DCX ) [ 48 ] and we found that this protein is acquired as a new partner of Kv 1 in Lgi1 - / - samples . Intriguingly , a specific loss of association with PSD93 but not with its twin PSD95 ( DLG4 ) or other MAGUKs is observed in Lgi1 - / - . We therefore investigated by Western blot and immunofluorescence whether the loss of association with PSD93 is accompanied by a decrease in its total expression level . As shown in Figure 3 , PSD93 expression levels were severely downregulated in Lgi1 - / - samples with a more prominent decrease in total brain homogenates ( PSD93 WT 1 . 00 ± 0 . 03 vs PSD93 Lgi1 - / - 0 . 46 ± 0 . 04 , p = 1 . 40x10 - 11 ) ( Figure 3a ) compared to hippocampal extracts ( PSD93 WT 1 . 00 ± 0 . 05 vs PSD93 Lgi1 - / - 0 . 68 ± 0 . 05 , p = 6 . 10x10 - 5 ) ( Figure 3b ) . A closer look at the subcellular distribution of PSD93 indicates that this decrease was not restricted to the AIS ( Figure 3e , f ) and was observed also in the stratum radiatum ( SR ) and stratum lucidum ( SL ) of CA3 ( Figure 3c , d ) . Finally , the association of Kv 1 with the myelin proteolipid protein ( MYPR ) , a major determinant in the formation and maintenance of the multilamellar structure of myelin is also lost in Lgi1 - / - . All these molecular signatures indicate a drastic change in Kv 1 membrane and sub - membrane 9 associated complexes and corroborate the significant downregulation of membranous Kv 1 . [ 8 ] 2 . 3 . 2 . New Kv 1 partners in Lgi1 - / - samples : In parallel to the loss of all the above mentioned membranous , sub - membranous and cytoskeletal links of Kv 1 , we found that , in Lgi1 - / - ( Table S3 ) , Kv 1 engages novel molecular interactions and shows association with the microtubule associated protein doublecortin ( DCX ) and with the GTPases Septin 6 and 7 that are involved in actin and microtubule cytoskeleton organization , membrane trafficking , vesicle transport and exocytosis as well as the assembly of scaffolding platforms . [ 49 50 ] Interestingly , Septin 6 has been shown to be localized at the neck of dendrites [ 51 ] , suggesting a potential reorganisation of Kv 1 localization . In addition , we found that in Lgi1 - / - samples , Kv 1 is associated with the calcium sensor Copine 6 that regulates structural plasticity of spines . Despite the loss of interaction with actin , Kv 1 in Lgi1 - / - acquires association with the filamentous protein and actin - crosslinking MARCS ( Myristoylated alanine - rich C - kinase substrate ) . The acquirement of Kv1 association with VAMP2 , syntaxin1A , synaptogyrin 3 , Copine1 , synapsin as well as dynamin 3 ( DYN3 ) indicate the presence of Kv 1 in vesicular compartments and suggest an increase in channel endocytosis . This is corroborated by the fact that neuronal activity blockade was shown to induce synaptic clustering of post - synaptic DYN3 [ 52 53 54 ] and that TTX - induced neuronal activity blockade induces a reduction of the Kv1 - mediated DTX - I sensitive current . 55 Also , it has been shown that activity - dependent Kv 1 . 2 endocytosis from distal apical dendrites is mediated by dynamin3 in CA3 pyramidal . [ 56 ] Therefore , the acquirement of DYN3 association with Kv 1 may be the read out of this mechanism . Since Kv1 levels are reduced in Lgi1 - / - , the association of Kv 1 with DYN3 might reflect a mechanism of Kv 1 retrieval at the dendritic level . This hypothesis is corroborated by the acquired Kv 1 10 association in Lgi1 - / - with annexin A2 ( ANXA2 ) which is a membrane - associated pleiotropic calcium - dependent phospholipid binding protein involved in several aspects of cell biology related to calcium signalling and endocytosis . ANXA2 is enriched in lipid rafts [ 57 ] and its secretion is activity - dependent . [ 58 ] It has been shown to be primarily present in GABAergic interneurons [ 58 ] and is overexpressed in pathological neuronal and glial reactions . [ 59 ] Therefore , its presence in the Kv 1 interactome in Lgi1 - / - background may be linked to the observed astrogliosis in these animals . In addition to the perturbation of Kv 1 cytoskeletal links , Kv 1 transit from ER / Golgi to plasma membranes seems also to be affected since the association of Kv 1 with the Golgi adaptors AP3S1 and AP1B1 [ 60 ] is disrupted . These adaptor proteins are known to play a crucial role in sorting the cargo destined to plasma membranes , neurites and nerve terminals . [ 61 62 ] An ER population of Kv 1 seems to be particularly prominent in Lgi1 - / - samples . This conclusion is driven by the fact that in Lgi1 - / - , Kv 1 is associated with LRRC59 and RPN1 . LRRC59 is an ER mRNA receptor known to participate in coupling translation and ER membrane insertion of transmembrane - domain containing proteins [ 63 ] and RPN1 ( dolichyl - diphosphooligosaccharide - protein glycosyltransferase subunit 1 is involved in early glycosylation steps of nascent proteins . The association with the receptor of activated protein C kinase 1 ( RACK1 ) , PKC  ( KPCG ) , the cAMP - dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit beta ( KAPCB ) and the adenylate cyclase activator LANC2 [ 64 ] may reflect a change in phosphorylation - mediated dynamic balance and stability of Kv 1 membrane expression . [ 65 ] Finally , the acquisition of association with L - lactate dehydrogenase B chain ( LDHB ) may indicate a functional modulation of channel activity since LDBH is part of the oxydoreductase complex and is involved in NAD metabolism which is important in Kv 1 . 2 activity modulation . [ 66 ] In parallel to this 11 association , Kv 1 coimmunoprecipitated with the voltage - dependent anion - selective channel protein 1 ( VDAC1 ) that binds sphingolipids , cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine and is involved in apoptosis and energy metabolism . 2 . 3 . 3 . Significant changes in the association of some Kv 1 partners in Lgi1 - / - samples : Among Kv 1 partners that were immunoprecipitated from both wild type and Lgi1 - / - extracts , those that varied less than ± 20 % were considered stable . ADAM22 ( Disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain - containing protein 22 ) association was by far the most affected partner with over 60 % decrease followed by DLG4 ( PSD95 ) > DLG1 ( SAP97 ) > DLG3 ( SAP102 ) with > 50 % , > 44 % and 40 % decrease respectively . Although both ADAM22 and ADAM23 co - immunoprecipitated Kv 1 . 2 from pre - enriched LGI1 - associated complexes [ 67 ] , ADAM23 was totally absent from our immunoprecipitations from both WT and Lgi1 - / - samples . Previous immunoprecipitations using anti - C - terminal Kv 1 . 2 antibodies also did not show association with ADAM23 . [ 14 ] Whether the absence of ADAM23 is the result of epitope accessibility in Kv 1 / ADAM23 complexes or reflects a real molecular organisation is still to be addressed . Beside these partners that show decreased partnership with Kv 1 , an important increase in channel association with several key proteins was observed . The biggest increase in interaction ( > 127 % ) is observed for 14 - 3 - 3  ( Ywhag ) . This increase is accompanied by a > 55 % augmentation of interaction with 14 - 3 - 3  . The second important increase ( > 77 % ) concerned the vesicle - associated membrane protein - associated protein A ( VAPA ) but not VAPB that remains rather stable . VAPA / B are tether proteins of membrane contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and the plasma membrane ( PM ) [ 68 ] rich in AKAPs , kinases , Rabs and non - vesicular lipid transfer 12 proteins ( i . e ASTRA , ASTRB [ 69 ] ) . VAPA / B possess a large number of common interactors , however , a specific interactome of each VAP exists yet without a clear functional discrepancy significance . [ 68 ] The reason for the selective change in VAPA remains obscure , however , it may be related to the observed increase in the ER population of Kv 1 and suggests that LGI1 is involved in the presence of Kv 1 channels at ER / PM contact sites . Whether the increase in VAPA levels is linked to the increase in Kv 1 association with ER proteins needs further investigations . In parallel to these differences , there was a significant increase of association with the cytosol aminopeptidase AMPL and the leucine - rich repeat and transmembrane domain - containing protein 2 ( LRTM2 ) , which are involved in axon guidance . It is interesting to note that while the interaction of Kv 1 with PP2BB is lost , the one with PP2BA increases by > 34 % . In parallel to the interaction with Septin 6 and 7 mentioned earlier , an increase of interaction with Septin 11 was observed . Septin 11 ( SEP11 ) , is enriched post - synaptically at the neck of dendritic spines at GABAergic synapses . [ 70 ] This observation suggests a reorganisation in the dendritic localisation of Kv 1 . Among the partners with increased association with Kv 1 , we found WD repeat - containing protein 26 ( WDR26 ) which is a G - beta - like negative regulator of MAPK pathway , which haploinsufficiency induces among other symptoms intellectual disability and seizures . [ 71 ] Interestingly , the LGI1 EPTP domain shows sequence homology with WD40 sequences [ 25 ] and may reflect a particular propensity of Kv1 subunits to interact with some WD40 motif - containing proteins . This finding supports the above mentioned suggestion for the existence of changes in the phosphorylation - mediated dynamic balance and stability of Kv 1 membrane expression [ 65 ] in Lgi1 - / - . In parallel to the acquired association with endocytotic markers mentioned earlier , the association of Kv 1 with syntaxin1B was also increased . 13 2 . 4 . Kv 2 expression is decreased in Lgi1 - / - Homo - tetrameric Kv 2 delayed - rectifier potassium channels are widely expressed though hetero - oligomers can occur in some cells . [ 72 ] VAPA / B interact with Kv 2 . 1 and Kv 2 . 2 channel subunits [ 73 ] and induce the formation of channel clusters . [ 72 ] At PM / ER contact sites , Kv 2 clusters constitute trafficking hubs where membrane protein insertion and retrieval take place . [ 74 ] As we observed an increase of VAPA association with Kv 1 in Lgi1 - / - and a loss of Kv 1 association with the VAPA interaction partner ASTRA , we undertook to investigate whether Kv 2 expression in Lgi1 - / - was modified . As shown in Figure 4a and b , Kv 2 . 1 expression was specifically and drastically reduced in hippocampus ( Kv 2 . 1 WT 1 . 00 ± 0 . 05 vs Kv 2 . 1 Lgi1 - / - 0 . 45 ± 0 . 04 , p = 1 . 00 x 10 - 9 ) compared to total brain homogenates ( Kv 2 . 1 WT 1 . 00 ± 0 . 09 vs Kv 2 . 1 Lgi1 - / - 1 . 01 ± 0 . 12 , p = 0 . 97 ) where no difference was observed . Kv 2 channels provide a major component of somatodendritic potassium currents and occur at the neuronal surface either in conducting freely - diffusing forms or non - conducting clusters . [ 75 ] These channels are involved in the dynamic modulation of excitability during periods of high neuronal activity . [ 75 76 ] In addition , a decrease in Kv 2 . 1 expression leads to an increase in the propensity of neurons to exhibit complex spike bursting . [ 29 ] In order to get more insight into potential modification in the expression of Kv 2 . 1 in the Lgi1 - / - hippocampal formation , we performed immunohistochemical staining of Kv 2 . 1 in hippocampal slices . As described earlier [ 77 ] , Kv 2 . 1 was mostly enriched in the CA1 compared to the CA3 ( Figure 4c ) . We found that in Lgi1 - / - , the expression level of Kv 2 . 1 in the CA3 was severely decreased ( Figure 4c , e ) . A closer look at the distribution of this channel in the CA3 shows also considerable decrease of expression in the stratum oriens ( SO ) and stratum pyramidale ( SP ) ( Figure 4d , f ) and that AIS labelling was severely diminished ( Figure 4f - h ) . In order to get more insight into the nature of the decrease in Kv 2 . 1 14 staining , we analysed the following four distinct staining parameters , either in global staining or at the AIS : i ) cluster density ii ) normalized immunoreactivity of the clusters iii ) cluster surface and iv ) cluster volume . As shown in Figure 4e and Figure 4h , cluster density was the only staining parameter that showed significant decrease in the global analysis or at the AIS . This fully converges with the previously reported dispersion of Kv 2 . 1 clusters in response to increased neuronal activity . [ 44 78 ] 2 . 5 . Functional correlate of changes in Kv 1 & Kv 2 expression levels and interactome changes We and others have previously shown that LGI1 is particularly enriched in the CA3 hippocampal subregions [ 79 80 23 ] and that it expression is crucial in controlling neuronal excitability in CA3 pyramidal neurons . [ 8 81 82 ] Moreover , LGI1 - dependent autoimmune limbic encephalitis is coincident with focal CA3 hippocampal atrophy in human patients [ 83 ] . It has also been pointed out that a decrease in somatodendritic D - type potassium currents [ 84 85 86 87 88 ] and a weak expression of Kv 2 channels [ 29 ] could promote the appearance of bursting patterns in hippocampal neurons . Although we have previously characterized the intrinsic excitability in CA3 pyramidal neurons in cultured hippocampal slices from Lgi1 - / - mutant mice [ 8 ] , it has been shown that cultured hippocampal slices develop , with time , spontaneous epileptiform - like activity . [ 89 ] In order to examine LGI1 deficiency - mediated modification in excitability independently from potential artefacts induced by slice culture conditions , we examined intrinsic excitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons from acute slices . To examine changes in excitability at the CA3 hippocampal level , we performed current clamp recordings from CA3 pyramidal neurons of WT and their Lgi1 - / - littermates ( Figure 5a , b ) . Similar to organotypic slices , we observed a marked increase of the excitability in CA3 pyramidal 15 neurons from Lgi1 - / - defined by a pronounced decrease in the rheobase ( WT = 119 ± 20 pA vs Lgi1 - / - = 45 ± 4 pA ; p = 5x10 - 6 , Mann - Whitney U test ) and a significant reduction of the latency to the first spike at the rheobase current ( WT = 482 ± 40 ms vs . Lgi1 - / - = 341 ± 30 ms ; p = 0 . 007 , Mann - Whitney U test ) ( Figure 5c , d , e ) . Neither the AP half - width ( WT = 1 . 22 ± 0 . 02 ms vs . Lgi1 - / - = 1 . 20 ± 0 . 02 ms ; p = 0 . 55 , Two samples t - test ) , nor amplitude ( WT = 90 . 10 ± 0 . 93 mV vs . Lgi1 - / - = 92 . 61 ± 1 . 00 mV ; p = 0 . 07 , Two samples t - test ) were modified ( Figure 5f - h ) . This is consistent with previous observations showing that the broadening of AP due to the loss or pharmacological inhibition of Kv 1 . 1 is only noticeable in presynaptic but not in somatic APs . [ 90 ] Interestingly , we observed a proportion of CA3 pyramidal neurons that exhibit spike bursts at the rheobase ( Figure 5i , j ) . Although this kind of firing pattern has been previously described [ 91 29 ] in WT cells , the proportion of neurons exhibiting bursts was substantially larger in Lgi1 - / - mice compared to their WT littermates ( WT bursting cells = 6 . 67 % , [ 2 / 30 cells ] vs . Lgi1 - / - bursting cells = 48 . 57 % , [ 17 / 35 cells ] ; p = 0 . 0003 Fisher’s exact test ) ( Figure 5k , l ) . In order to address bursting propensity and based on a previous work that focused on this type of firing pattern in CA3 pyramidal neurons [ 29 ] , we performed a different set of experiments in which neurons were challenged with either 300 pA or 600 pA current injection pulses ( 0 . 5ms ) . The proportion of cells bursting at 300pA was significantly larger in Lgi1 - / - mice ( WT = 12 . 5 % [ 1 / 8 cells ] vs . Lgi1 - / - 87 . 5 % [ 7 / 8 cells ] ; p = 0 . 01 Fisher’s exact test ) and virtually all the Lgi1 - / - cells challenged with 600 pA current injections exhibited a bursting pattern ( WT = 12 . 5 % [ 1 / 8 cells ] vs . Lgi1 - / - 100 % [ 8 / 8 cells ] ; p = 0 . 001 Fisher’s exact test ) ( Figure 5m - o ) . 3 . Discussion In this study we combined immunofluorescence and mass spectrometry experiments to address modifications in Kv 1 distribution and interactome in Lgi1 - / - . It was previously 16 reported that Kv 1 channels undergo a severe downregulation in mice lacking LGI1 [ 8 ] as well as upon in vivo hippocampal infusion of LGI1 antibodies . [ 21 ] In this study , we performed a detailed immunohistochemical analysis of Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 expression at the Lgi1 - / - hippocampus . The use of antigen retrieval techniques , a necessary condition to reveal Kv 1 immunoreactivity at the AIS of hippocampal neurons [ 92 ] , allowed an accurate and reliable analysis of modifications of the Kv 1 expression pattern at the cellular and subcellular levels . To our knowledge , this is the first time that Kv 1 expression at the AIS is evaluated in fixed brains of Lgi1 - / - mice . In addition to previous observations on Kv 1 downregulation at the AIS , we uncovered an important overall decrease in all neuronal compartments . This finding reflects more adequately the massive decrease in Kv 1 expression measured in Western blots since the reduction of Kv 1 population in the AIS cannot account for the > 50 % overall decrease . The stable expression of Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 in PV + interneurons is consistent with the finding that the electrophysiological properties of PV interneurons were unchanged in Lgi1 - / - [ 19 ] , and that deleting LGI1 in PV + interneurons did not influence seizure susceptibility . [ 93 ] Mass spectrometry analysis of Kv 1 - associated complexes in Lgi1 - / - revealed intricate molecular changes in the Kv 1 interactome . Besides the major impact on the Kv1 association with the cytoskeletal network , the significant modification in Kv 1 association with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins may be an important readout of the perturbations associated with the absence of LGI1 . 14 - 3 - 3 are homo / hetero multimeric cytosolic phospho - proteins that are highly expressed in brain and implicated in cell signalling pathways . 14 - 3 - 3  mutations have been shown to be associated with several brain disorders such as epileptic encephalopathy [ 94 95 ] as well as febrile seizures . [ 96 ] Also , 14 - 3 - 3  plays a pivotal role in oligodendrocytic apoptosis and neuroinflammation . [ 97 ] Recently , it was shown that ADAM22 phosphorylation ( S 832 ) stabilizes its interaction with 14 - 3 - 3 17 proteins (  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  ) and protects it from endocytosis . [ 98 ] Of note , the loss of interaction of 14 - 3 - 3 with non - phosphorylated ADAM22 does not influence ADAM22 association with LGI1 , Kv 1 . 2 or PSD95 . It is therefore tempting to speculate that in Lgi1 - / - mice , a homeostatic cell response aiming at stabilizing membrane Kv 1 drives an increase in ADAM22 / 14 - 3 - 3 / Kv 1 . 2 association . Further investigation of the Kv 1 phospho - proteome is still necessary to ascertain these suggestions . An additional important perturbation was the sharp reduction in the expression level of PSD93 in whole - brain and hippocampal homogenates , with a prominent reduction at the AIS of CA3 pyramidal neurons . Although PSD93 is one of the major constituents of LGI1 [ 67 99 ] and ADAM22 - associated complexes [ 20 ] , it poorly associates with Kv 1 . 2 in whole brain extracts . [ 14 ] The observed specific loss of interaction with PSD93 is consistent with the previously published data showing that PSD93 but not PSD95 [ 28 14 ] nor ADAM22 [ 14 ] is important in Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 channel localisation and clustering at AIS . [ 5 ] The selective decrease in PSD93 expression contrasts with the reported stability of PSD95 in the Lgi1 - / - background [ 100 ] and shows that the association of Kv 1 with PSD93 but not SAP97 , SAP102 nor PSD95 is dependent on the presence of LGI1 . Interestingly , RhoA activity has been shown to be significantly increased in Lgi1 - / - . [ 101 ] Also , RhoA activity mediates spine morphological and functional plasticity [ 102 103 ] and may therefore be linked to the observed actin cytoskeleton remodelling . Interestingly , PSD93 phosphorylation by RhoA was recently shown to decrease its binding to ADAM22 and to increase PSD93 heterodimerization with PSD95 . [ 99 ] The only partner of Kv 1 that interacts with PSD95 / PSD93 and that is specifically lost in our immunoprecipitations from Lgi1 - / - tissue is the plasma membrane calcium ‐ transporting ATPase 4 ( AT2B4 / PMCA4 ) that was shown to be enriched in lipid - rafts . [ 104 ] AT2B4 interaction with PSD95 / 93 has been shown to increase with neuronal excitability and 18 glutamate release . [ 105 ] This increase in excitability leads to the activation of NMDA receptors and triggers AT2B4 selective internalization . [ 106 ] In addition to these observations , it is known that the activity of AT2B4 is inhibited by 14 - 3 - 3  [ 107 ] which interacts with and modulate the expression of the LGI1 - binding partner ADAM22 . Despite that the protein expression level of AT2B4 did not show any significant difference between WT and Lgi1 - / - samples ( Figure S5 Supplementary Information ) the loss of PSD93 co - immunoprecipitation with Kv 1 in Lgi1 - / - may partially reflect the loss of Kv 1 association with AT2B4 . Since LGI1 was shown to regulate PSD95 - mediated AMPA and NMDA receptor levels in neurons [ 100 ] , it may be suggested that , in the Lgi1 - / - epileptic model , a hyperexcitability - driven increase of interaction between PSD95 and AT2B4 could be blocked by the expected increase in RhoA - mediated PSD95 / PSD93 interaction . Of note , it was recently reported that the truncation of the MAGUK binding domain of ADAM22 induces a massive reduction in hippocampal PSD95 expression levels . [ 20 ] In line with these observations , the loss of PSD93 co - immunoprecipitation with Kv 1 in Lgi1 - / - may be the result of a RhoA - kinase phosphorylation of PSD93 and a concomitant delocalization of the PSD95 / PSD93 complex . Further analysis is still necessary to understand the specificity of the seemingly key disruption of PSD93 association with Kv 1 complexes in Lgi1 - / - . The most abundant partner of Kv 1 that we find in Lgi1 - / - is the glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( G3P ) ( Table S3 , Figure S6 ) which is found with an emPAI ( 1 . 64 ± 0 . 34 ) close to the emPAI value of actin ( 2 . 12 ± 0 . 0 ) in wild type tissue ( Table S2 , Figure S6 ) . G3P is a moonlighting protein involved in several regulatory pathways including synaptic transmission and intermembrane trafficking . [ 108 ] The second most abundant acquired interaction partner is the fatty - acid binding protein FABP7 which is involved in the uptake of fatty acids and serves as a cellular chaperone of lipophilic 19 molecules . This protein is expressed in astrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells ( OPCs ) [ 109 110 ] and has been shown to regulate dendritic morphology and excitatory synaptic function of cortical neurons . [ 111 ] This observation is in line with the potential expression of Kv 1 . 2 in astrocytes . [ 112 ] Interestingly , among the newly acquired partners we found PCMD2 ( protein - L - isoaspartate O - methyltransferase domain - containing protein 2 ) a member of the L - isoaspartyl O - methyltransferases ( PIMT ) protein family , known to repair natural protein damage . [ 113 114 115 116 ] The presence of this protein in Kv 1 - associated complexes may suggest that at least some of its components may be under repair and imply a higher level of protein damage / recycling than in WT tissue . The presence of synapsin 2 ( SYN2 ) and the voltage - dependent anion - selective channel protein 1 ( VDAC1 ) in the Kv 1 interactome of Lgi1 - / - corroborates this hypothesis since these proteins have been identified as major endogenous substrates for PIMT . [ 116 ] The association with the ATPase - dependent chaperone T - complex protein 1 subunit delta ( TCPD ) is in line with this interpretation and may highlight attempts for recovery from damage . This protein localises to dendrites and is involved in microtubule organisation in dendrites . [ 117 ] Trafficking pathways associated with Kv 1 also seem to have been affected in Lgi1 - / - tissue , as the presence of AP1 - and AP3 - associated coat protein PACS1 decreased by > 29 % and the association with PSD1 ( Cytohesin 1 ) , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ARF6 involved in neuron projection development , protein trafficking and cytoskeletal rearrangements [ 118 ] , decreased by > 38 % . All these results underscore the complex nature of Kv 1 interactions , where the absence of LGI1 leads to a complex rewiring of protein partnerships , resulting in both gains and losses that intricately modulate the network dynamics and underly a complex deleterious phenotype in the Lgi1 - / - mouse . 20 In parallel to the direct observations driven by mass spectrometry analysis , we report for the first time a massive reduction in Kv 2 in Lgi1 - / - . In addition to the crucial role of Kv 1 channels in tuning the excitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons [ 119 ] , its decrease at the somatodendritic compartment may trigger an increased after - depolarization . [ 84 ] Moreover , the reduction in Kv 2 expression may cause an increase in dendritic calcium spikes . These two different mechanisms could act synergistically facilitating bursting . [ 84 ] 29 ] Our results are also in agreement with other described forms of increased excitability in Lgi1 - / - mice [ 120 19 121 ] , and with the observed increase in excitability upon the treatment of slices with LGI1 antibodies . [ 122 81 82 ] The importance of Kv 2 downregulation in perturbing excitability in LGI1 deficiency is also highlighted by the fact that restoring Kv 1 . 1 expression in secretion - deficient LGI1 W183R neurons does not fully rescue the mice life span . [ 22 ] Further investigations are needed to address whether LGI1 is directly implicated in modulating Kv 2 expression levels and whether Kv 1 downregulation is parallel to or consequent to Kv 2 downregulation . In the light of the concomitant decrease in Kv 1 and Kv 2 expression levels , we addressed the intrinsic excitability properties of CA3 pyramidal neurons of Lgi1 - / - . We and others have previously shown that LGI1 is particularly enriched in CA3 hippocampal subregion [ 79 80 23 ] and that LGI1 is crucial in controlling neuronal excitability in CA3 pyramidal neurons . [ 8 81 123 ] Moreover , LGI1 antibody - mediated limbic encephalitis is coincident with focal CA3 hippocampal atrophy in human patients . [ 83 Although we have previously characterized the intrinsic excitability in pyramidal CA3 neurons of Lgi1 - / - cultured hippocampal slices [ 8 ] , it has been proposed that cultured hippocampal slices spontaneous develop epileptiform activity . [ 89 ] To eliminate a potential bias introduced by the use of organotypic cultures , and to gain further 21 understanding of the mechanisms underlying LGI1 deficiency - mediated epilepsy , we analysed intrinsic excitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons from acute slices . We observed an increase in neuronal burst firing propensity and intrinsic excitability defined as a decrease in the rheobase and a shortened latency to the first spike . This gain in excitability converges with the decrease in Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 as well as Kv 2 described throughout this study , and is in accordance with the crucial role of Kv 1 channels in tuning CA3 pyramidal neurons excitability [ 119 ] and the implication of dendritic D - type potassium currents [ 84 ] and Kv 2 channels [ 29 ] in the promotion of bursting patterns in hippocampal neurons . The presented results are also in agreement with other described forms of increased excitability in Lgi1 - / - mice [ 120 22 121 ] , and with the observed increase in excitability upon the treatment of slices with LGI1 antibodies . [ 122 81 123 ] Expectedly , there was no change in AP waveform since the broadening of the AP due to the loss or pharmacological inhibition of Kv 1 . 1 is only noticeable in presynaptic , but not in somatic APs . [ 90 ] Although these promising results deserve further investigation , it is widely accepted that synchronized bursting is the cellular substrate for interictal spikes , which , in turn , constitute a hallmark of epilepsy . [ 124 125 ] Given the high degree of recurrent connectivity in the CA3 hippocampal region [ 126 127 ] , it is tempting to propose a cellular landscape in which the abnormally increased burst firing , in combination with a lower firing threshold in Lgi1 - / - CA3 pyramidal neurons , triggers the epileptogenic phenotype observed in Lgi1 - / - mice . 4 .

Cell membranes were harvested by a 30 min centrifugation at 16000 x g and resuspended in lysis buffer for protein analysis . Biochemical sample preparations and immunoprecipitations : Wild type and Lgi1 − / − [ 130 ] ( the original Lgi1 − / − mice strain was a generous gift from Stéphanie Baulac , ICM , Paris , France ) mice total brains or hippocampi ( 15 - 16 days ) were extracted , snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at - 80°C until use . Homogenisation ( 1 ml / brain ) was performed in HB buffer ( 20 mM Na phosphate pH 7 . 4 , 30 mM NaCl containing phosphatase inhibitors ( Pierce TM ) and protease inhibitors ( Complete , Roche Diagnostics GmbH ) and nuclei were eliminated by 900 x g centrifugation . Supernatants were either directly processed for SDS - PAGE analysis and Western blot or solubilized for immunoprecipitation in HB supplemented with 1 % CHAPS at 5 mg / ml and subjected to 100 . 000 x g ultracentrifugation . The solubilised material from both wildtype and Lgi1 - / - samples was precleared with rProtein A Sepharose Fast Flow ( Cytiva ) and immunoprecipitated in triplicates using the polyclonal anti - Kv 1 . 2 antibody ( 3 - 5 µg / immunoprecipitated sample ) . Immunoprecipitated samples were washed three times with HB containing 0 . 5 % CHAPS before denaturation . Samples were then analysed either by SDS - PAGE and Western blot or by mass spectrometry . C3HeB / FeJ Kcna2 mice brains ( P10 ) ( Kv 1 . 2 - / - ) and their wild type littermates [ 56 ] were extracted and deep frozen in dry ice then transferred to - 80°C and stored until use . Homogenisation and analysis by Western blot were performed as described for WT and Lgi1 - / - samples . Mass spectrometry : Samples were treated and analyzed as in . [ 23 ] Briefly , immunoprecipitated proteins were concentrated and analyzed by mass spectrometry 25 using a hybrid Q - Orbitrap mass spectrometer ( Q - Exactive , Thermo Fisher Scientific , United States ) coupled to nanoliquid chromatography ( LC ) Dionex RSLC Ultimate 3000 system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , United States ) . All raw data files generated by MS were processed to generate mgf files and screened against the Swissprot database ( Swissprot version june 2019 , ( 560 , 118 sequence ) , with the taxonomy Mus musculus , using the MASCOT software ( www . matrixscience . com , version 2 . 3 ) . The database was searched in the decoy mode and emPAIs automatically calculated by the MASCOT algorithm . All samples were analysed in triplicates . For each antibody , background interactomes obtained with non - immune antibodies were subtracted using an Excel script . Keratins , ribosomal proteins , DNA binding proteins , mitochondrial proteins , transcriptional proteins and immunoglobulins were excluded from the list of candidates . Candidates with emPAI < 0 . 1 were not interpreted . Functional properties of candidate proteins were classified using the pantherdb web site ( www . pantherdb . org ) ( Supplementary sheet ) . The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE [ 131 ] partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD043649 . Immunohistofluorescence staining of fixed brains : Fixed brains of P14 - P16 C57BL / 6 wild - type mice or Lgi1 - / - littermates of either sex were sliced and stained as described in . [ 23 ] For Kv 1 . 1 and Kv 1 . 2 staining , an antigen retrieval process was applied as in . [ 33 32 ] Image analysis : image analysis was performed as described in . [ 23 ] Briefly , AnkyrinG staining was used to measure the immunoreactivity of Kv 1 . 1 , Kv 1 . 2 , Kv 2 . 1 and PSD93 ascribable to the AIS . For 3D quantification in confocal images , 3D objects counter [ 132 ] and 3D ROI manager [ 133 ] were integrated into custom - written FIJI scripts available 26 upon reasonable request . In the sake of clarity in Figure 3e , the PSD93 signal corresponding to the AIS was extracted by using the “Clear Outside” method in ImageJ after using the thresholded AnkyrinG signal as a 3D selection . Acute Slice preparation : All experiments were performed in accordance with the European and institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals ( Council Directive 86 / 609 / EEC and French National Research Council ) and approved by the local authority ( Préfecture des Bouches - du - Rhône , Marseille ) . Mice of either sex were used in this study . Postnatal ( P14 ) WT or Lgi1 - / - mice were deeply anesthetized in isoflurane ( 3 % in oxygen , 2 L / min ) and decapitated . After brain removal , the brains were immersed in oxygenated ( 95 % O 2 , 5 % CO 2 ) ice - cold low - calcium artificial CSF ( aCSF ) containing the following ( in mM ) : 125 NaCl ; 2 . 5 KCl ; 1 . 25 NaH 2 PO 4 ; 0 . 5 CaCl 2 ; 2 MgCl 2 ; 26 NaHCO 3 ; 10 D - Glucose ; pH 7 . 4 . Horizontal slices ( 350µm ) were cut in a vibratome ( Leica VT1200S ) in oxygenated ice - cold low - calcium aCSF . Afterwards , slices were transferred and kept at least 1h at RT in oxygenated aCSF containing the following ( in mM ) : 125 NaCl ; 2 . 5 KCl ; 0 . 8 NaH 2 PO 4 ; 26 NaHCO 3 ; 3 CaCl 2 ; 2 MgCl 2 ; 10 D - Glucose ; pH 7 . 4 . Electrophysiology and data analysis : Whole - cell recordings of visually identified CA3 pyramidal neurons were performed in a temperature controlled ( 30°C ) chamber superfused with oxygenated aCSF . Borosilicate patch pipettes ( 3 - 5 MΩ ) were pulled on a DMZ - Universal Puller ( Zeitz Instruments ) and filled with an internal solution containing ( in mM ) : 120 K - gluconate ; 20 KCl ; 10 HEPES ; 0 . 1 EGTA ; MgCl 2 ; 2 Na 2 ATP ; 0 . 3 NaGTP ; pH 7 . 4 ; 290 - 300 mOsm . Recordings were made in current clamp mode with a multiclamp 700B amplifier ( Molecular Devices ) and pClamp10 software . 27 Recordings were acquired at 10 kHz and filtered at 3 kHz . Neurons with a resting membrane potential > - 55mV were discarded from the final analysis . Intrinsic excitability was assessed by injecting a range of 0 . 8s current pulses ( ranging from - 50 to 250 pA ; 10 pA / step ) and counting the number of spikes . Input – ouput curves were determined and rheobase was defined as the minimal current eliciting at least one action potential . To study bursting propensity , depolarizing current injections of 0 . 5s ( 300 or 600 pA ) were applied every 2 s . Bursts were scored when ≥ 2 APs appeared in the same response showing progressively smaller amplitude and longer duration . [ 29 ] To analyse the proportion of cells exhibiting complex bursts , only cells showing bursts at the rheobase current injection were considered . To study burst propensity , only cells exhibiting bursts when challenged with either 300 pA or 600 pA depolarizing pulses were defined as positive . AP parameters ( AP half - width and AP amplitude ) were extracted from the first spike in the rheobase . To prevent synaptic contamination 3mM kynurenate and 100µM picrotoxin ( both from SIGMA ) were systematically added to the aCSF . Cells were held at ~ - 70 mV during experiments and recordings were not corrected for liquid junction potential . All data were analyzed using ClampFit ( Molecular Devices ) . Data are presented as mean ± SEM . Mann – Whitney U test , Two samples T - test , and Fisher’s exact test were used for comparisons . Normality tests were applied before the use of the Mann - Whitney U test or Two samples t - test . Figure legends Figure 1 . Kv 1 . 1 expression is reduced in Lgi1 - / - mice .
