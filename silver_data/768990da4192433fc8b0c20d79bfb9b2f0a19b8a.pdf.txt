However , the study of single - cell spatial metabolomics in undecalcified bones faces several significant challenges , such as the fragility of bone which often requires decalcification or fixation leading to the degradation or removal of lipids and other molecules and . As such , we describe a method for performing mass spectrometry imaging on undecalcified spine that is compatible with other spatial omics measurements . In brief , we use fresh - freeze rat spines and a system of carboxyl methylcellulose embedding , cryofilm , and polytetrafluoroethylene rollers to maintain tissue integrity , while avoiding signal loss from variations in laser focus and artifacts from traditional tissue pro - cessing . This reveals various tissue types and lipidomic profiles of spinal regions at 10 µm spatial resolutions using matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization mass spectrometry imaging . We expect this method to be adapted and applied to the analysis of spinal cord , shedding light on the mechanistic aspects of cellular heterogeneity , development , and disease pathogenesis underlying different bone - related conditions and diseases . This study furthers the methodology for high spatial metabolomics of spines , as well as adds to the collective efforts to achieve a holistic understanding of diseases via single - cell spatial multi - omics . The spinal column , or vertebral column , is important in both structure and function in many organisms , including humans 1 . The main components of the spinal column are the spinal cord , vertebrae , intervertebral discs 2 , muscle , and blood vessels , which combine to enable communication between the brain and the body for sensory and motor function 3 . There are several lay - ers to the spinal cord , including the grey matter in the inner part of the spinal cord and white matter in the outer part 4 . Grey mat - ter of the spinal cord contains nuclei involved in sensory and motor functions and the white matter contains the tracts of ax - ons , known as the ascending tracts and descending tracts 5 . In - formation is in the spinal cord is carried either to the brain via ascending tracts or to the motor neurons via descending tracts . 5 The vertebrae of the spinal column are bones that surround and protect the spinal cord and roots 6 . There are many diseases or injuries that affect the spinal column , often resulting in changes or loss in function ( s ) due to its importance and complexity 7 , 8 . These dysfunctions vary in severity and are broadly categorized as mechanical , neuropathic , or medical 8 and include spina bi - fida 9 , scoliosis 10 , rheumatoid arthritis 11 , osteoporosis 12 , and spi - nal cord injury ( SCI ) 13 . SCI is characterized by neurological dysfunction and may or may not include damage to the rest of the spinal column 14 . Depending on the nature of the trauma and the location within the spine at which the trauma occurred , SCI due to trauma to the spinal column differs in severity 15 . Whether the SCI is chronic or not , there are many associated conditions 14 . Notably , even acute SCI can cause dysregulation of cardiovascular function due to the loss of sympathetic con - trol 14 . Because of the importance and possible dysfunctions of the spine , it is necessary to have ways to study the spine . The spine may be imaged in humans for diagnostic purposes , which may be accomplished via several modalities of various sensitivities and resolution 16 . The most common is x - ray radi - ography 17 , which quickly ( sec - min ) provides information for a m 2 sized areas compared to other related modalities 18 and pro - vides radiographic information about bone structures in a non - static context such as mobility 19 or bending radiography 20 , 21 . Computed tomography ( CT ) involves reconstructing the inter - nal structures of the body from a collection of X - ray data taken from hundreds or more angles 22 , 23 – 25 . Both X - ray radiography and CT share the risks of high radiation exposure , especially for higher - resolution images 26 . Another form of imaging is nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , which defines soft tissues and neural elements 27 and can non - invasively create an image without applying radiation 28 , 29 through the use of dyes 30 . The above methods of imaging can be performed in living organ - isms , but lack discrete molecular resolution , which is critical in understanding healthy and diseased ( dys ) function . Some meth - ods may be more suited for discrete molecular information , al - beit at the cost of imaging are , include Raman spectroscopy 31 , infrared spectroscopy 32 , and mass spectrometry imaging 33 , which use spectral information at exact spatial locations to create an image with varying levels of specificity . To determine discrete metabolomic profiles of critical spinal cord regions , we use matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization mass spectrom - etry imaging ( MALDI MSI ) , which is a label - free imaging method that uses a laser to desorb / ionize molecules that have been co - crystallized in a small organic matrix 34 . Because this ionization method relies on the use of a laser , most of the ion - ized molecules come from the sample surface 34 . Because of the sensitivity and power of MSI , it can provide orthogonal infor - mation that could not be acquired via MRI or CT alone , such as the spatial location of lipids 35 , glycans 36 , peptides 37 , 38 , pro - teins 39 – 41 , and metabolites 42 – 44 in tissues . Previously , MALDI MSI been applied to diseases 45 – 47 , dysfunction 48 , develop - ment 49 , trauma 50 , 51 , drug discovery and development 52 – 54 , etc . by using animal 46 – 55 and human 45 , 55 , 56 models , demonstrating its utility and importance . Prior work on fresh - frozen tissue was performed by separating the spinal cord from the surrounding bone , then using desorp - tion electrospray ionization ( DESI ) MSI 57 – 59 , secondary ion mass spectrometry ( SIMS ) MSI 60 , 61 , or MALDI MSI 60 , 62 . As such , we have aimed to image non - decalcified , fresh frozen spi - nal cord while it is still surrounded by the corresponding bone and muscle to best preserve and visualize its native metabolic features . In brief , the MALDI MSI workflow requires success - ful tissue preparation for data acquisition , making methods for tissue preparation an important area of research in the field 63 , 64 . Sectioning the tissue to a thickness of approximately 8 - 12 µm 65 , with thinner sections resulting in a better signal - to - noise ratio , 66 is a major requirement of MALDI MSI . For this reason , a method for sectioning the spinal column without disturbing its native chemical architecture is necessary . Commonly , the spi - nal column is decalcified before sectioning to soften the bone , but decalcification interferes with the endogenous metabo - lites 67 . Methods for sectioning bone have been previously ac - complished 68 – 72 , and we aim to develop subsequent methods to apply this approach to the spinal column . The spinal column is difficult to section to an 8 - 12 µm thickness because there are multiple tissue types of different densities and hardness being cut at a single time . Often , the sectioned spinal column does not maintain spatial integrity if cut and manipulated as loose tissue . Here , we demonstrate a method of performing MALDI MSI on fresh frozen , unfixed , undecalcified spinal columns at 10 µm spatial resolution . To do this , we use a cryotape - based method for sectioning the spinal column , including the spinal cord with surrounding bone and soft tissues intact . We compare the sec - tioning results with and without our approach to demonstrate the benefit of our approach with the goal of maintaining spatial and structural integrity of the spinal column during tissue prep - aration . This method is developed as a subsequent method of bone sectioning for MALDI MSI 68 , 72 to be applied to the spinal column . EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Chemicals . Chemicals were purchased by Thermo Fisher and used without further purification unless otherwise speci - fied . Tissue Preparation . All procedures were approved by the University of California Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in accordance with the guide - lines and policies of the Animal Center . Spines were harvested from Sprague Dawley female rats , aged 3 months ( 89 days ) and euthanized with an overdose of carbon dioxide , with the strain code 400 sourced from Charles River . The spines were frozen using an isopentane - dry ice slurry and stored at - 80°C . When specified , spines were embedded and frozen in carboxymethyl cellulose ( CMC ; EMD Millipore Corp . , Burlington , MA ) . The tissue was sectioned to 10 µm using Cryofilm type 2C ( 9 ) tape ( SECTION - LAB Co . Ltd . , Yokohama Kanagawa , Japan ) and a cryostat ( Leica Biosystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) while at - 20 ˚C . The tissue in CMC was held in the cryostat using an optimal cutting temperature compound ( Fisher HealthCare , Houston , TX ) . After sectioning , the tape with tissue was adhered to a slide prepared with copper tape ( SECTION - LAB Co . Ltd . ) and ZIG 2 - way glue ( Kuretake Co . , Ltd . , Nara , Japan ) before being heat - fixed at 37 ˚C . Tissue was used immediately after sectioning . Staining . H & E staining ( Abcam plc . , Cambridge , UK ) was performed at ~ 20 ˚C ( room temperature ) as previously de - scribed , with minor alterations to the previous procedure to avoid damage to the glue and tape 73 . In brief , the tissue was in - cubated in hematoxylin , rinsed in water , incubated in bluing re - agent , rinsed , and incubated in Eosin for contrast . Tissue was then coversliped with glycerol wet mount medium ( Rs ' Science ) for microscopic imaging using an EVOS™ M7000 Imaging System ( brightfield , 20x objective ; Invitrogen , Waltham , MA ) was used for microscopy imaging . Matrix Application . 1 , 5 - Diaminonaphthalene ( DAN , To - kyo Chemical Industry Company Ltd . , Tokyo , Japan ) matrix ( 20mg / mL in tetrahydrofurane ) was applied using an HTX M3 + sprayer ( HTX Technologies , LLC , Chapel Hill , NC ) . Important parameters include : 40 ˚C nozzle , gas pressure w as 15 nitrogen psi , 50 µL / min solvent flow rate , and a 2 mm track spacing for 5 passes . MALDI Q - TOF MSI . A timsTOF fleX dual source MALDI mass spectrometer ( Bruker Scientific , Billerica , MA ) was used for the MALDI MSI experiments . Each experiment was per - formed in positive mode with a 10 µm 2 or 30 µm 2 raster width as described in subsequent figure captions . A detailed descrip - tion of the method is available in the supplemental information section ( SI table S1 ) . In brief , 150 shots were fired in a single burst , the global attenuator value was set to 0 % , the local laser power was set to 88 % , and the m / z range acquired was m / z 50 to 2000 . The laser was manually focused using Galvano offset , moving the laser in the X and Y direction by up to 80 µm in each to compensate for the height of the tape . Data Analysis . An internal , quadratic calibration of m / z val - ues was performed using common lipids ( [ PC ( 26 : 0 ) + H ] , ( [ PC ( 32 : 0 ) + H ] , ( [ PC ( 32 : 0 ) + Na ] , ( [ PE ( 36 : 1 ) + H ] , ( [ PC ( 34 : 2 ) + H ] , ( [ PC ( 36 : 1 ) + Na ] ) within DataAnalysis ( Bruker Scientific ) . Putative lipid identification was performed using the LIPID MAPS database 74 . All MALDI MSI ion images were created using SCiLS Lab Version 2023 ( Bruker Scientific ) with total ion count normalization . Average spectra were created by manually segmenting different regions using SCiLS Lab . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Sectioning Workflow – Tape Method Figure 1 .

( I ) Data analysis is performed using a variety of soft - ware packages to create lipid profiles of major spinal regions . Figure was made using Biorender . Our goal was to develop a method for performing MALDI MSI on fresh frozen , unfixed , undecalcified spinal column ( Figure 1 ) . Ultimately , any tissue distortion or degradation will prevent high quality and reproducible spatial analysis by MALDI MSI or other imaging modalities . First , we embed and froze the un - decalcified fresh - frozen spinal column in 2 . 6 % CMC at - 80 ˚C to preserve the chemical architecture of the tissue and protect the edges during sectioning . Spinal column is complex and con - tains diverse components which will not remain intact as a co - hesive section once sectioned from the tissue block , but by add - ing tape , the section is reinforced such that a single , cohesive piece can be maneuvered . This reinforced spinal section can be manipulated similarly to other tissues , such as brain or kidney , enabling 10 µm sectioning . We apply conductive copper tape across the entire ITO coated glass slide and press the copper tape uniformly onto the slide using a razor blade . A thin and uniform layer of ZIG 2 - way glue is added across the slide for adhering the tape and tissue . The addition of excess glue or air bubbles prevent laser focusing during MALDI MSI analysis . Additionally , if the glue is not dry , the glue layer often becomes uneven perhaps from the PTFE roller or other physical interac - tions . The slide is then cooled for at least 30 seconds to prevent heat fixation prior to tape adherence . One adhered , we gently use a PTFE roller to remove air bubbles , facilitating a consistent and flat surface for MALDI MSI . Finally , the slide is coated in DAN matrix and MALDI MSI is performed . Although we use DAN as a MALDI matrix , other matrices can be used with this method with minor adjustments to sprayer methods Figure 2 . H & E stained section of undecalcified , unfixed , fresh - frozen spinal column under different conditions for both transverse and sagittal sections showing bone , bone marrow , muscle , nerves , grey matter , and white matter ( SI Figure 1 ) . In brief , we assessed the effects of CMC embedding and use of cryotape for both transverse ( A ) and sagittal cuts ( B ) . In general , we found that CMC embedding and the use of the cryotape preserved the tissue adequately ( left column ) . Cryotape was required for preserving the vertebra for both transverse ( A . 1 and A . 3 ) and sagittal ( B . 1 and B . 3 ) sections , while CMC embedding preserved the muscle tissue surrounding the spinal cord for both transverse ( A . 2 and A . 4 ) and sagittal ( B . 2 and B . 4 ) sections . The above procedure has several variables that were tested and optimized to determine their effects on tissue integrity , using H & E staining as a metric . Here , we compare the sections with and without the use of a cryotape as well as with and without CMC embedding to assess the effects of each step . H & E stain - ing shows the severity of vertebrae cracking and tissue rear - rangement or destruction during sectioning . Overall , the spinal column sectioned using cryotape resulted in less bone cracking and tissue degradation than the equivalent sections , sectioned without cryotape ( Figure 2 ) . Additionally , embedding in CMC resulted in fewer cracks within the vertebrae when compared to non - embedded tissue , albeit this effect was not as significant as seen with use of the cryotape . Moreover , CMC serves a second - ary benefit as the tape often gets caught on the blade when CMC is not present ( Figure B . 3 ) . Although the cryotape has reduced the cracking and tissue degradation , there are some cracks that can be addressed in future experiments . Largely , the tissue re - mains intact as is evident in the clean boundaries shown by the H & E staining ( Figure 2 ) . Spinal column sections without cryotape resulted tissue rear - rangement and loss due to the fragility of the undecalcified bone and the innate separation between various tissue types through - out the spinal column . Various areas within the spinal column are not directly connected , so they move independently of each other . The tape directly adheres to the tissue , maintaining the integrity and spatial arrangement of the spinal cord . Addition - ally , the tape prevents the tissue from curling , which contributes to bone cracking and spatial rearrangement of the tissue , since it must be uncurled during slide adherence . The tissue blocks embedded in CMC allowed for a flat surface to adhere the entire piece , while the unembedded tissue has loose tape edges around the tissue that often caught on the blade during sectioning , re - sulting in additional artifacts . As such , the use of cryotape and CMC embedding preserves the most tissue content . Although other embedding media were not directly tested , they should be compatible with the use of cryofilm . Figure 3 . Use of a PTFE roller resulted in fewer air bubbles and , thus , fewer imaging artifacts . ( A ) H & E stain of a sagittal , undecal - cified fresh - frozen spinal column embedded in CMC adhered to the slide using forceps without direct tissue contact . The presence of air bubbles between tape and glue is indicated by dark gray shadows . ( B ) An H & E stained tissue section adhered using a PTFE roller prior to heat fixation . ( C ) An H & E stained tissue section adhered using a PTFE roller after heat fixation , resulting in significant tissue degradation . ( D ) Example ion image of a sagittal spinal cord that was adhered using forceps as opposed to a roller ( E ) . The tape is thin and flexible , making it difficult to adhere to the tape uniformly and resulting in the presence of air bubbles that will negatively affect MALDI MSI . To address this , we tried both pressing the tape to the glue with forceps and using a PTFE roller . In brief , the forceps were used to press the tape to the glue without directly touching the tissue , as direct contact by forceps would result in tissue damage . However , this resulted in air bubbles from inadequate tape adherence . Using a PTFE roller , however , resulted in fewer air bubbles , likely because a more uniform pressure could be applied to a larger area at a sin - gle time ( Figure 3 ) . Like other artifacts , air bubbles can be problematic for high spatial resolution MALDI MSI because any tissue above an air bubble is at a different height than the surrounding tissue , and thus , a different laser focus . This results in areas where the peak intensities are significantly lower or al - together absent ( Figure 3D ) . We found that the PTFE roller must be used before heat fixation because the warm tissue will smear ( Figure 3C ) , unlike when the tissue is still at - 20 ˚C ( Fig - ure 3B ) . Using a PTFE roller successfully removes air bubbles with minimal damage to the tissue because the PTFE roller acts as a flat surface to apply consistent pressure across the tape and PTFE does not stick to tissue . Figure 4 . Average mass spectrum for each region within the spinal column ( n = 3 ) with lines pointing to the respective region . The averaged mass spectrum is shown for each region ( left ) and enlarged spectra covering the lipid region ( right ) . On average , we detected 54 lipids in positive ion mode , with a majority being phosphatidylcholines ( PC ; SI Table S2 ) , which is typical of positive ion mode . Although not performed , this sampling method is compatible with negative ion mode . The average mass spectrum for each tissue type shows a difference in ion composition ( Figure 4 ) . For instance , the bone marrow has an abundance of [ PC ( O - 34 : 1 ) + H ] + , [ PC ( O - 34 : 1 ) + Na ] + , [ PC ( 34 : 1 ) + K ] + lipids , while the muscle is characterized by [ PC ( 34 : 2 ) + K ] + . Lipids play vital roles in a variety of cellular structures and processes because they are indispensable ele - ments of myelin , cellular membranes , and vesicles that enable intracellular trafficking . In addition , lipids are involved in met - abolic processes for energy production and are implicated in in - flammations and bone - related diseases 75 . Largely , we are de - tecting membrane lipids , such as sphingomyelin ( SM ) and phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) lipids . 76 Differences in lipid content may be a result of different cell types or cell shapes within these regions . 77 – 80 For these reasons , we believe it is important to study the spinal lipidome . While there are discrete differences between tissue regions , the reproducibility of these profiles is notable ( SI Figure S1 ) . To demonstrate the localization of these lipids , we picked the top discriminators of each region ( Figure 5 ) . Figure 5 . The major components of the spinal column can be visualized using MALDI MSI . such as intervertebral discs and blood vessels ( A . 2 , B . 2 , m / z 725 . 5557 , lipid [ SM ( 34 : 1 ; O2 ) + Na ] + ) , white matter ( A . 3 , B . 3 , m / z 746 . 6041 , lipid [ PC ( O - 34 : 1 ) + H ] + ) , bone marrow ( A . 4 , B . 4 , m / z 768 . 5857 , lipid [ PC ( O - 34 : 1 ) + Na ] + ) , muscle ( A . 5 , B . 5 , m / z 796 . 5243 , lipid [ PC ( 34 : 2 ) + K ] + ) , grey matter ( A . 6 , B . 6 , m / z 834 . 5967 , lipid [ PC ( 38 : 3 ) + Na ] + ) , nerves ( A . 7 , B . 7 , m / z 853 . 6529 , lipid [ SM ( 42 : 1 ; O2 ) + K ] + ) . The sagittal cut results in a larger section than the transverse cut ( Figure 5 ) , making it more difficult to uniformly apply to the slide . This resulted in some taller regions of tape where the laser was less focused than it was during data collection of surround - ing areas on the tissue ( Figure 5B . 1 ) . Note , the sections in Fig - ure 3E and and Figure 5B . 1 are the same tissue slide and data set , with different ions and colors . The ions chosen for Figure 5 represent sphingomyelin ( SM ) and phosphatidylcholine lipids ( PC ) , which are the two most common lipid classes in the outer cellular membrane . 76 SM lipids are abundant in myelin sheaths , which electrically insulate nerve cell axons . 81 [ SM ( 34 : 1 ; O2 ) + Na ] + ( green , Figure 5 ) is a sphingomyelin lipid that localizes to the intervertebral disc and blood vessels in both the transverse and sagittal cuts . Interesting , this lipid has been known to accumulate in the glomeruli of diabetic and high - fat diet fed mice , 82 perhaps indicating that it may have a functional role in wildtype spinal cord , but a dysregulation or protective function in other organs . Another sphingomyelin lipid , [ SM ( 42 : 1 ; O2 ) + K ] + , localizes to nerves ( teal , Figure 5 ) , and could be a necessary component in neuronal membranes 83 . SM lipids are , indeed , relevant to human health , 84 demonstrated by their role in diabetes , 82 , 85 , 86 coronary artery disease , 87 , 88 Parkin - son’s disease , 89 cancer , 90 – 92 and Niemann - Pick disease , 93 and mapping them to specific functional regions may help decipher discrete SM functional roles . Additionally , [ PC ( 38 : 3 ) + Na ] + lo - calizes to the grey matter ( yellow , Figure 5 ) and is also detected in lower abundance within the bone marrow and muscle . More - over , [ PC ( O - 34 : 1 ) + H ] + was detected within both the white mat - ter and bone marrow ( blue , Figure 5 ) and its sodiated form only within the bone marrow ( pink , Figure 5 ) , perhaps indicating a difference in salt content . [ PC ( 34 : 2 ) + K ] + ) lipid ( red , Figure 5 ) is localized mainly to the muscle , with some presence in the bone marrow . This is a significant lipid to detect because PC ( 34 : 2 ) is thought to be a biomarker for metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) , which is related to an increased risk of diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ) . 94 , 95 Figure 6 . MALDI MSI layered ion images of undecalcified fresh - frozen spinal columns transversely cut from three different adult rats , normalized by total ion count . ( A ) Spinal column cut transversely with a raster width of 30 µm . ( B ) Spinal column cut trans - versely with a raster width of 10 µm and minimal surrounding muscle included in MALDI MSI . ( C ) Spinal column cut transversely with a raster width of 30 µm . We aimed to assess spines from several rats at various points in the lumbar region to compare the ions in different tissue types . Three undecalcified fresh - frozen spinal columns from three dif - ferent adult rats resulted in ion images that showed consistent localization of the same six ions based on the spatial location of the tissue types ( Figure 6 ) . The MALDI MSI layered ion images of the spinal columns cut in the transverse direction ( Figure 6 ) show the same ions but result in images that appear slightly dif - ferent overall . For instance , there appears to be more or less of any given tissue type and overall size in a section , each of which are from various places in the spine of three different rats ( Fig - ure 6 ) . This is expected to be the case because the spinal col - umns have been sectioned at varying places within the spinal column for each spinal column and some tissue types are more or less present at different points throughout the spinal column . For example , some areas are more densely packed with nerves than other areas , which results in a higher abundance of ions from that tissue type . These drastic changes , even at small step sizes down the spinal column demonstrate why spatial analysis is important . While slight differences within cell types and states are present , the ions used to discriminate the each spinal cord feature are robust in the fact that even slight differences in depth do not affect their localizations to specific tissue types . For instance , [ SM ( 34 : 1 ; O2 ) + Na ] + most notably localizes to the intervertebral disc and blood vessels ( Figure 6A ) , while [ PC ( O - 34 : 1 ) + Na ] + is primarily present in the bone marrow of two of the spines ( Figure 6A , 6B ) , but it is has a difference in abun - dance in the white matter of each spine . [ PC ( O - 34 : 1 ) + Na ] + is more abundant in the white matter of the third spine , demon - strating a difference in the relative abundance of , perhaps , a spe - cific cell type ( Figure 6C ) . This lipid was less abundant in the spine shown in figure 6A , and rarely present in the spine in fig - ure 6B . We expect this difference to be due to the sections being taken from different areas in the lumbar region of the three mice . The three spines have a different abundance and spatial location for [ SM ( 34 : 1 ; O2 ) + Na ] + because it appears to represent the presence of blood vessels 96 and intervertebral discs 97 in the lumbar tissue , which are not consistent in the lumbar region as a function of length 96 . [ PC ( 32 : 1 ) + H ] + is known to be common in biological tissue 98 – 101 and is shown here to be located in the nerves surrounding the white matter in the spinal cord ( Figure 5H , 5N , 6 ) . Finally , [ PC ( 32 : 1 ) + H ] + , [ PC ( O - 34 : 1 ) + H ] + , [ PC ( 34 : 2 ) + K ] + , and [ PC ( 38 : 3 ) + Na ] + remained consistent in spatial location across the three spines . We expect this to be due to each of these lipids having the same function across the three rats and throughout the lumbar region . CONCLUSION Using MALDI mass spectrometry imaging ( MSI ) on undecal - cified fresh - frozen spinal column allows us to see the differ - ences in chemical composition and create images of the native spinal column across several tissue types without the assistance of labels , staining , etc . Using H & E staining and MALDI MSI to visualize the resulting sections , we found that our method helps maintain the spatial and structural integrity of the spinal column , ensuring that single - cell data accurately represents the in vivo cellular environment . This method can be applied to study genetic diseases and structural defects , by comparing the biomolecules present in disease states versus non - diseased tis - sue , and observing the biomolecular changes during develop - ment or due to traumatic injuries . This method allows for the precise sectioning of undecalcified fresh - frozen spinal columns , providing a valuable tool for studying the spinal column and related diseases . The ability to section undecalcified spinal col - umn should allow for spatial analysis of biomolecules at a sin - gle cell level within the spinal column without the interaction or degradation associated with decalcifying bones . Analyzing native bone tissue metabolism at the single - cell level will lead to insights into bone physiology and pathophysiology , as well as potential applications in regenerative medicine and therapeu - tic development for bone - related disorders .
