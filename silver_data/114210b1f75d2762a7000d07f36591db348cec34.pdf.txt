To test whether environmental cues induce seasonal changes in electrophysiological characteristics of song control neu - rons , we measured in vitro intrinsic neuronal activity in the song control nucleus RA of adult male song sparrows ( Melospiza melodia ) in both the fall non - breeding and spring breeding seasons . We found that RA neurons in spring - captured birds show a more than threefold increase in spontaneous W ring rate compared to those from fall - cap - tured birds . We conclude that environmental cues are su Y - cient to induce seasonal changes in electrophysiological properties of song control neurons , and that changes in these properties may underlie seasonal changes in song behavior .

The neural substrates that control reproductive behavior often undergo a functional reorganization , facilitating enhanced perfor - mance ( Tramontin and Brenowitz 2000 ; Brenowitz 2004 ) . These phenomena are observed in all vertebrate taxa , but one of the best - studied and most pronounced examples occurs in singing behavior and the song - control system in adult songbirds ( Fig . 1a , Nottebohm 1981 ; Tramontin and Brenowitz 2000 ; Ball et al . 2004 ; Brenowitz 2004 ) . Song is a learned vocalization used to attract mates , defend territories , and recognize mates or territorial J .

During the breeding season , song production , stereotypy and duration increase ( Tramontin and Brenowitz 2000 ; Ball et al . 2004 ; Brenowitz 2004 ) . Accompanying these behav - ioral changes , several song nuclei expand , some through incorporation of new neurons and some through the growth of pre - existing neurons . These morphological and behav - ioral changes are mediated by steroid hormones and can be mimicked in captive birds by manipulating photoperiod and plasma testosterone ( T ) concentration ( Nottebohm 1981 ; Tramontin and Brenowitz 2000 ; Ball et al . 2004 ; Brenowitz 2004 ) . Only recently have seasonal changes in electrophys - iological properties begun to be studied in avians . Research has generally focused on either how auditory stimuli are di V erentially processed between seasons in wild - caught birds or seasonal - like conditions in laboratory - housed birds ( Lucas et al . 2002 ; Del Negro and Edeline 2002 ; Del Negro et al . 2005 ; Lucas et al . 2007 ) , or on how seasonal - like changes in the electrophysiological properties of song con - trol nuclei might contribute to creating more stereotyped song ( Park et al . 2005 ) . Speci W cally , one change recently discovered is that the spontaneous activity of neurons in the pre - motor song - control nucleus RA ( Fig . 1a ; robust nucleus of the arcopallium ; nomenclature used here follows Reiner et al . 2004 ) increases when adult male Gambel’s white - crowned sparrows ( Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii ) are exposed to breeding - season photoperiod and systemic T levels ( Park et al . 2005 ) . To test whether environmental cues alone induce similar changes in neural activity in wild birds , we studied adult male song sparrows ( Melospiza melodia ) in the fall non - breeding season and in the spring breeding season . Song sparrows are closely related to the white - crowned sparrows used in laboratory studies ( Carson and Spicer 2003 ) . Sea - sonal changes in song sparrow song behavior , song nucleus structure , and endocrinology parallel those observed in labo - ratory - manipulated white - crowned sparrows ( Wing W eld and Hahn 1994 ; Smith et al . 1997a ; Tramontin and Brenowitz 1999 ; Tramontin et al . 2001 ; Brenowitz 2004 ; Per W to et al . 2004 ; Thompson and Brenowitz 2005 ; Soma 2006 ) . More - over , song sparrows in western Washington state remain on their territories all year round , enabling study of the same population across seasons ( Wing W eld and Hahn 1994 ) . In both species , song structure becomes more stereotyped , and plasma T levels , song nucleus volumes , and RA soma areas increase compared to non - breeding condition birds ( Smith Fig . 1 A Simpli W ed schematic of the avian song control system . HVC and RA are part of the descending motor circuit necessary for song pro - duction . RA projects to the brainstem motoneurons that control the muscles involved with respiration and the sound production organ , the syrinx .

D Histogram of W ring rate distributions in fall and spring J Comp Physiol A 123 et al . 1997a ; Tramontin et al . 2001 ; Brenowitz 2004 ) . Both species are age - limited song learners ( Marler and Tamura 1964 ; Marler and Peters 1987 ; Nordby et al . 2002 ) . After capturing a song sparrow in the W eld , we quickly returned to the laboratory , prepared brain slices and mea - sured the intrinsic spontaneous activity of RA neurons . Fir - ing rates of RA neurons from birds caught in the spring were higher than in the fall . This is the W rst demonstration of seasonal change in any electrophysiological property in the song system of a non - captive bird . Comparison of sea - sonal di V erences in song sparrow RA spontaneous activity to those measured in wild - caught and captive individuals of other species in comparable physiological states reveal sim - ilar changes in W ring rates , suggesting common underlying ionic and endocrine mechanisms . Methods Animals All procedures used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Uni - versity of Washington . We collected W ve adult male song sparrows ( Melospiza melodia ) using mist nets at W eld sites in Washington State during the autumn non - breeding sea - son ( early October 2005 , late September and early October 2006 ) , and W ve more during the spring breeding season ( late March 2006 ) , as in Smith et al . ( 1995 ) and Tramontin et al . ( 2001 ) . We transported the birds to the laboratory and created acute brain slices from the birds within 12 h of cap - ture . We used the in vitro acute brain slice preparation to ensure that the electrical activity recorded was intrinsic to the neuron . After sacri W ce , we visually con W rmed the pres - ence and state of growth of the testes to ensure that the birds were male and that the testes were regressed in the fall and large in the spring . Electrophysiology Preparation of brain slices Methods for preparing slices have been described else - where ( Park et al . 2005 ) . Brie X y , each animal was anesthe - tized with iso X urane , euthanized by decapitation and the brain rapidly dissected into ice - cold , oxygenated arti W cial cerebral spinal X uid ( ACSF ) , containing ( in mM ) 119 NaCl , 2 . 5 KCl , 1 . 3 MgSO 4 , 2 . 5 CaCl 2 , 1 NaH 2 PO 4 , 16 . 2 NaHCO 3 , 11 D - glucose , and 10 HEPES , osmolarity adjusted to 310 – 320 mOsm with sucrose . Parasagittal brain slices ( 300 (cid:1) m thick ) were prepared using a Vibratome , and slices were stored at room temperature submerged in bub - bled ACSF in which HEPES was replaced with equiosmo - lar NaHCO 3 . All chemicals were obtained from Sigma – Aldrich ( St Louis , MO , USA ) . Electrophysiological recording Recording methods have been described elsewhere ( Park et al . 2005 ; Solis and Perkel 2006 ) . Recordings were car - ried out at least 60 min after slices were collected . For recording , a slice was submerged in a small chamber per - fused with ACSF maintained at 30°C and containing 150 (cid:1) M picrotoxin ( Sigma ) and 1 mM kynurenic acid ( Sigma ) . Single - unit extracellular recordings were obtained from neurons within a region that could be reliably identi - W ed as RA using trans - illumination . Only well - isolated spikes with high signal - to - noise ratios were studied ( all waveforms had a signal - to - noise ratio of ¸ 3 ) . Recording electrodes were made from pulled borosilicate glass pipettes ( WPI , Sarasota , FL , USA ) with tips broken to a resistance of 3 – 6 M (cid:2) and W lled with 0 . 9 % NaCl . Extracel - lular potentials were ampli W ed 10 £ using an Axoclamp 2B ampli W er ( Axon Instruments , Foster City , CA , USA ) and ampli W ed a further 100 £ using a Brownlee model 410 ampli W er ( Brownlee Precision , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . The W ltered signals ( low - pass W ltered at 3kHz ) were then digi - tized at 20kHz with a Digidata 1322A ( Axon Instruments ) and stored on a PC using pCLAMP 9 ( Axon instruments ) . Data analysis Data analysis methods have been more fully described else - where ( Park et al . 2005 ; Solis and Perkel 2006 ) . Brie X y , spontaneous spike trains were analyzed o V - line using a cus - tom written program in IGOR ( Wavemetrics , Lake Oswego , OR , USA ) by Michele M . Solis and David J . Per - kel , and with pCLAMP 9 ( Axon Instruments ) . To ensure that spike - events were single units , we analyzed the spike amplitude and waveform . Only well - isolated spikes with high signal - to - noise ratios were studied ( Fig . 1b ) . The spontaneous activity was observed for at least W ve minutes and the W ring rate was obtained by dividing the number of spikes observed by the duration of the recording . Brain histology and morphometry At the end of the recording , we W xed each slice overnight in 4 % paraformaldehyde solution in 0 . 1 M PB at 4°C . The slices were then brie X y washed with 0 . 1 M PB , cryopro - tected in 30 % sucrose in 0 . 1 M PB , and re - sectioned to a thickness of 50 (cid:1) m using a freezing microtome . We mounted sections on slides and stained them with cresyl violet . We then measured the area of 100 somata in RA by tracing their diameters , using a random systematic sampling method ( Tramontin et al . 1998 ) . Neurons were distinguished J Comp Physiol A 123 from glia by having one round nucleolus , a well - de W ned nuclear envelope , nongranular cytoplasm , and / or an obvi - ous axon hillock ( Goldman and Nottebohm 1983 ; Smith et al . 1995 , 1997a , b ; Tramontin et al . 1998 ) . Hormone assay We collected blood from wing veins into a heparinized microhematocrit tube and stored it on ice until centrifuga - tion . Blood was successfully obtained from all birds at sac - ri W ce and from some birds in the W eld ; we did not collect enough plasma from two spring birds to accurately test T concentration . Plasma was harvested and stored at ¡ 20°C for subsequent steroid radioimmunoassay ( RIA ) . To mea - sure circulating T , we followed the RIA protocol of Tramontin et al . ( 2001 ) , using a Coat - a - Count RIA kit ( Diagnostic Products Corp . , Los Angeles , CA , USA ) . The minimum detectable plasma T concentration was 0 . 2 ng / ml . Birds with undetectable T levels were treated as having concentrations of 0 . 2 ng / ml for statistical analysis . We note that circulating steroid hormone levels are not necessarily identical to those in the brain parenchyma , due to local neu - rosteroid synthesis ( Schlinger and London 2006 ) . Statistics Fall W ring rates measured by pooling cells across all birds did not approximate a normal distribution , so we tested sta - tistical signi W cance using a Mann – Whitney U test . The nonparametric Kolmogorov – Smirnov two - sample test ( K – S test ) was used for comparison of the cumulative fre - quency distributions between spring and fall W ring rates . An alpha level of 0 . 05 was used . To compare W ring rates between di V erent species and manipulations ( Fig . 3 ) , we used a non - parametric Kruskal – Wallis ANOVA followed by Dunn’s Multiple Comparison test . If W ring rates are instead analyzed by calculating a mean W ring rate for each individual bird , the resulting distributions pass a normality test , and we therefore used a t test . Soma area distributions were normally distributed , and we used a t test to determine signi W cance . We compared plasma T concentrations using an ANOVA and a Tukey’s Multiple Comparison test . Results We recorded 40 single units from W ve male song sparrows captured in the fall , and 48 single units from W ve male song sparrows captured in the spring . RA units were spontane - ously active in vitro ( Fig . 1B ) , as previously described in zebra W nches ( Mooney 1992 ; Spiro et al . 1999 ; Solis and Perkel 2006 ) , and white - crowned sparrows ( Park et al . 2005 ) . To ensure that the spontaneous activity was an intrinsic property of recorded neurons , the bathing solution contained the glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid ( 1 mM ) and the GABA A receptor antagonist picrotoxin ( 150 (cid:1) M ) . Additionally , the in vitro slice preparation removed the cell bodies of many excitatory a V erents to RA . RA neuron W ring rates changed seasonally ; neurons dis - charged at low rates in the fall , and considerably faster in the spring ( Fig . 1C , D ; Table 1 ; P < 0 . 0001 , U = 354 . 0 , 40 fall units , 48 spring units ) . A cumulative distribution analy - sis further demonstrated that spring W ring rates were higher compared to the fall ( Fig . 2A ; P < 0 . 001 , D = 0 . 5 , 40 fall units , 48 spring units ) . If seasonal changes are compared by calculating the mean W ring rate for each bird , spring W ring rates continue to be signi W cantly higher than those in the fall ( Fig . 2B , P < 0 . 0005 , t = 6 . 505 , df = 8 ) . Fall T levels and RA neuronal soma sizes were low , and spring T levels and soma sizes were signi W cantly higher ( Table 1 ; P < 0 . 05 for both ; t = 2 . 374 df = 8 for soma area ; F = 7 . 186 for T levels ) , replicating previous work ( Smith et al . 1997a ; Tramontin et al . 2001 ) . Spring plasma T levels measured at the time of sacri W ce were signi W cantly lower than those measured at capture ( Table 1 ; P < 0 . 05 ) , but both sets of measurements are in the physiological range of spring - captured birds ( Smith et al . 1997a ; Tramontin et al . 2001 ; Soma et al . 2004 ) . Discussion We found that RA spontaneous activity was high during the spring breeding season , and low during the fall non - breed - ing season . These changes in W ring rates were temporally correlated with previously reported di V erences in song Table 1 Values are mean § SEM ; in the “Number” column , values not in parentheses are total number of units recorded , and values in parenthe - ses are numbers of animals Within columns , values with di V erent superscripts di V ered signi W cantly from each other . In the spring , plasma T levels at capture di V er signi W cantly from levels at sacri W ce , but both sets of measurements were in the physiological range of spring - captured birds ( Smith et al . 1997a ; Tramontin et al . 2001 ) . We note that the minimum detectable plasma T level was 0 . 2 ng / ml ( see “Methods” ) , and that in both this and previous studies the plasma T levels of wild birds captured in the fall were near or below the T detection limit ( Smith et al . 1997 ; Tramontin et al . 2001 ; Soma et al . 2004 ) Season Number Spontaneous W ring rate ( Hz ) Mean soma size ( (cid:1) m 2 ) Plasma T at sacri W ce ( ng / ml ) Plasma T at capture ( ng / ml ) Fall 40 ( 5 ) 1 . 3 § 0 . 2 a 82 . 8 § 7 . 4 a 0 . 20 § 0 . 07 a N / A Spring 48 ( 5 ) 4 . 7 § 0 . 6 b 103 . 9 § 4 . 9 b 0 . 94 § 0 . 28 b 8 . 35 § 4 . 0 J Comp Physiol A 123 stereotypy , plasma T concentration , and song nucleus vol - ume and neuronal attributes ( Smith et al . 1997a ; Tramontin et al . 2001 ; Soma et al . 2004 ; Thompson and Brenowitz 2005 ) . This is the W rst demonstration of seasonal change in any electrophysiological property in the song system of a non - captive bird . To determine the generality of our results we compared the W ring patterns observed here to those found in wild - caught and captive individuals of other species in compa - rable physiological states . We generally W nd the same pat - tern : birds in non - breeding condition have slow spontaneous W ring rates , while birds in breeding condition have higher spontaneous W ring rates ( Fig . 3 ) . Spontaneous W ring rates from song sparrows and a spotted towhee ( Pipilo maculates ; unpublished data , JM ) captured in the wild in fall and Gambel’s white - crowned sparrows exposed in the laboratory to nonbreeding conditions ( data from Park et al . 2005 ) were slow . Spring - caught song sparrows , laboratory - manipulated white - crowned spar - rows exposed to breeding photoperiod and hormonal con - ditions , and laboratory zebra W nches ( Taeniopygia guttata ; data from Solis and Perkel 2006 ) in breeding con - dition all had signi W cantly faster spontaneous W ring rates than non - breeding condition birds ( P < 0 . 01 , KW = 104 . 4 , sample numbers noted in Fig . 3 ) . These similar changes in RA spontaneous W ring rate seen in both wild and labora - tory - manipulated birds suggest common underlying endo - crine and ionic mechanisms , and illustrate the complementary nature of comparative laboratory and W eld studies ( Brenowitz and Beecher 2005 ) . Though laboratory environments provide greater control of relevant variables compared to the W eld environment experienced by wild animals , it is necessary to demonstrate that the phenome - non studied in the laboratory mimics that found in the wild ( e . g . , Smith 1996 ; Fusani et al . 2005 ) . This is espe - cially important for a phenomenon like seasonal plastic - ity , since environmental ( Wing W eld and Kenagy 1991 ; Moore et al . 2004 ; Per W to et al . 2004 ; Per W to et al . 2005 ) and social cues ( Wing W eld and Kenagy 1991 ; Tramontin et al . 1999 ; Sartor and Ball 2005 ) can be di Y cult to repro - duce in the laboratory ( Wing W eld and Kenagy 1991 ; Fusani et al . 2005 ) . Thus , this study’s W nding that changes in spontaneous W ring rates occurs in wild - caught song sparrows validates and extends the laboratory manipula - tions and species used to study mechanisms and func - tional consequences of seasonal plasticity of the adult song system ( Ball et al . 2004 ; Brenowitz 2004 ; Park et al . 2005 ) . Why do W ring rates , soma sizes and nucleus volumes change between the breeding and non - breeding seasons ? One hypothesis is that decreasing W ring rates and soma sizes reduce the energetic demands imposed by the song control nuclei outside the breeding season , a time of year when song is not used for mate attraction and the use of song for territorial defense is relaxed or absent . Maintain - ing the song nuclei in their fully grown state with high spontaneous activity in at least RA increases the metabolic demands imposed by the song system ( Wennstrom et al . 2001 ) . Much of the energetic cost imposed by the brain is due to processes that enable spiking activity ( Ames 2000 ; Attwell and Laughlin 2001 ; Lennie 2003 ) . Decreasing spontaneous activity of RA neurons outside the breeding season would decrease these energetic costs . The conse - quent decrease in song stereotypy , duration , and rate at this time of year can be tolerated due to the absence of mating and reduced or absent territoriality . This hypothesis pre - dicts that spontaneous activity in RA is in some way func - tionally related to song production , and thus song should change along with spontaneous activity , whether seasonal or developmental . This prediction is supported by the pres - ent study , where changes in spontaneous activity tempo - rally correlate with known changes in song stereotypy and RA soma size ( Smith et al . 1997a ; Tramontin et al . 2001 ) , and studies of seasonal - like plasticity in the laboratory , where hormone - induced changes in spontaneous activity temporally correlate with changes in song stereotypy and Fig . 2 RA W ring rates are faster in the spring than in the fall . A Cumu - lative frequency distributions of W ring rates recorded in fall and spring captured birds ( see text for statistical signi W cance ) . B Firing rates ana - lyzed by calculating a mean W ring rate for each bird , instead of pooling cells from all birds as in all other analyses . Horizontal lines indicates mean W ring rate of all birds caught in that particular season . Di V erent letters denote signi W cant di V erences J Comp Physiol A 123 RA soma size in white - crowned sparrows ( Smith et al . 1995 ; Tramontin et al . 2000 ; Park et al . 2005 ) . Similar relationships between spontaneous activity and song char - acteristics are observed in the developing zebra W nch , where spontaneous activity ( Adret and Margolish 2002 ) , soma size ( Bottjer et al . 1986 ; Konishi and Akutagawa 1985 , 1990 ; Adret and Margolish 2002 ) , and song stereo - typy ( Adret and Margolish 2002 ) all increase with age . In adult canaries ( Serinus canarius ) , similar seasonal or hor - monally - induced changes in song ( Nottebohm et al . 1986 ; Nottebohm et al . 1987 ) and anatomy ( Nottebohm 1981 ; Canady et al . 1988 ) have been reported . Spontaneous activity in RA , however , has not been investigated in canaries . Though spontaneous activity is only one of many electrophysiological properties of a neuron , it has been shown in other systems to be directly related to a neuron’s intrinsic excitability ( Häusser et al . 2004 ; Gittis and du Lac 2006 ) , and can in X uence how a neuron responds to synap - tic input ( Häusser et al . 2004 ; Loewenstein et al . 2005 ) . Thus , recording spontaneous activity is a useful tool for studying neuronal excitability ( Häusser et al . 2004 ; Gittis and du Lac 2006 ) , but further work in seasonally - breeding birds is needed to relate spontaneous activity to other elec - trophysiological and morphological properties in RA , and to further delineate its functional relevance to song produc - tion . Finally , seasonal changes in song control neuron elec - trophysiology are likely not limited to either spontaneous activity or the nucleus RA , and this will be explored in future studies .
