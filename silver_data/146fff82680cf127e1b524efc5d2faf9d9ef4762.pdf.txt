Vol . 214 No . 2 197 – 213 www . jcb . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201601025 Introduction Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that carry bioactive protein and RNA cargoes and are secreted upon fusion of mul - tivesicular late endosomes ( MVEs ) with the plasma membrane ( PM ; Théry , 2011 ; Raposo and Stoorvogel , 2013 ) . Exosomes control various cellular and organismal functions , including immune cell communication , coagulation , and Drosophila mating behavior ( Aharon et al . , 2008 ; Mittelbrunn et al . , 2011 ; Aatonen et al . , 2014 ; Choudhuri et al . , 2014 ; Corrigan et al . , 2014 ) . In cancer , exosome secretion can promote tumor growth , angiogenesis , and metastasis and alter the tumor microenvi - ronment ( Bobrie et al . , 2012 ; Peinado et al . , 2012 ; Kucharze - wska et al . , 2013 ; van Balkom et al . , 2013 ; Costa - Silva et al . , 2015 ; Hoshino et al . , 2015 ) . Recent studies have demonstrated secretion of exosomes by diverse cell types ( Théry , 2011 ; EL Andaloussi et al . , 2013 ) and identified key regulators of MVE docking and fusion with the PM , including Ral1 , Rab35 , Rab27 , and synaptotagmin - 7 ( Hsu et al . , 2010 ; Ostrowski et al . , 2010 ; Bobrie et al . , 2012 ; Hoshino et al . , 2013b ; Hyenne et al . , 2015 ) . Deregulation of Rab27 and Rab35 in cancer suggests that cancer cells may de - velop mechanisms to control exosome secretion ( Hendrix et al . , 2010 ; Dong et al . , 2012 ; Ho et al . , 2012 ; Allaire et al . , 2013 ) . Exosomes can also be regulated earlier in the endocytic traffick - ing pathway . Thus , receptor ubiquitination , ceramide synthesis , or recruitment of adaptor molecules can regulate intraluminal vesiculation and cargo content ( Trajkovic et al . , 2008 ; Sor - kin and von Zastrow , 2009 ; Baietti et al . , 2012 ; Hyenne et al . , 2015 ) . However , the molecular mechanisms that control and promote exosome secretion are still poorly understood . Cortactin is an actin - binding protein that is overexpressed in many tumors and controls diverse branched actin - dependent processes , including cell motility , invasion , and membrane traf - ficking ( Kirkbride et al . , 2011 ) . In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma , cortactin overexpression is associated with decreased patient survival ( Schuuring et al . , 1992 ; Schuuring , 1995 ; Rodrigo et al . , 2000 , 2009 ; Yuan et al . , 2003 ) . Recently , we identified cortactin as a key regulator of late endosomal trafficking ( Sung et al . , 2011 ; Kirkbride et al . , 2012 ; Hong et al . , 2015 ) . Cortactin also regulates invadopodia , which are branched actin - rich PM sites of matrix degradation and MVE docking sites ( Kirkbride et al . , 2011 ; Hoshino et al . , 2013b ) . Here , we report that cortactin levels control the number of exosomes secreted from cancer cells . We confirm a role for cortactin in late endosomal trafficking ( Kirkbride et al . , 2012 ; Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that influence cellular behavior and enhance cancer aggressiveness by carrying bioactive molecules . The mechanisms that regulate exosome secretion are poorly understood . Here , we show that the actin cytoskeletal regulatory protein cortactin promotes exosome secretion . Knockdown or overexpression of cortactin in cancer cells leads to a respective decrease or increase in exosome secretion , without altering exosome cargo content . Live - cell imaging revealed that cortactin controls both trafficking and plasma membrane docking of multivesicular late endosomes ( MVEs ) . Regulation of exosome secretion by cortactin requires binding to the branched actin nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex and to actin filaments . Furthermore , cortactin , Rab27a , and coronin 1b coordinately control stability of cortical actin MVE docking sites and exosome secretion . Functionally , the addition of purified exosomes to cortactin - knockdown cells rescued defects of those cells in serum - independent growth and invasion . These data suggest a model in which cortactin promotes exosome secretion by stabilizing cortical actin - rich MVE docking sites .

Mechanistically , we find that cortactin , coronin1b , and Rab27a coordinately con - trol actin stability at invadopodial cortical MVE docking sites ( Hoshino et al . , 2013b ) and exosome secretion . Functionally , cortactin - knockdown ( KD ) cell defects in serum - independent growth and invasion are rescued by addition of purified exo - somes . These data indicate that control of branched actin dy - namics is a critical regulatory point for exosome secretion . Results Cortactin regulates exosome secretion To test whether cortactin controls exosome secretion , we down - regulated or overexpressed cortactin protein in SCC61 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells by expressing spe - cific targeting shRNAs or by overexpression of mouse cortactin ( Fig . S1 , A and B ) . To collect exosomes , cells were cultured in Opti - MEM media for 48 h , followed by sequential differential centrifugation of the conditioned media ( Thery et al . , 2006 ) . Opti - MEM contains growth factors , so it sustains cell growth while avoiding contamination with exosomes from serum . Con - sistent with our previous finding that cortactin does not affect cell proliferation in a growth factor – replete environment ( Clark et al . , 2009 ) , cortactin KD did not affect cell number or viability after 48 h in Opti - MEM ( Fig . S1 , C and D ) . To distinguish between microvesicles ( MVs ; ≥ 1 µm in size ) and exosomes ( 40 – 100 nm ) , the respective 10 , 000 g and 100 , 000 g fractions were analyzed by NanoSight nanoparti - cle tracking analysis ( NTA ; Fig . S1 , E – I ; and Fig . 1 , A – C ) . We did not observe differences in the mean number or size of MVs purified from control and cortactin KD cells ( Fig . S1 , E – I ) . In contrast , NTA of the exosome fractions revealed a de - crease in the number of exosomes secreted by cortactin - KD cells ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . Re - expression of mouse wild - type ( WT ) cortactin in human - specific cortactin shRNA - expressing cells ( see Fig . 5 B ) fully rescued exosome secretion ( Fig . 1 B , KD1 / WT cells ) . Finally , we found that cortactin overexpres - sion significantly increases exosome secretion ( Fig . 1 B , OE ) . There was no difference in the NTA - calculated mean exosome vesicle size ( Fig . 1 C ) . Analysis of exosome preparations by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ; Fig . 1 , D – F ) con - firmed the significant decrease in the number of exosomes secreted from cortactin - KD cells without an effect on vesi - cle size ( Fig . 1 , D – F ) . To characterize further the exosome fraction , we performed Western blot ( WB ) analyses . As expected , the vesicles were positive for the exosome markers TSG101 , CD63 , and Flotillin1 and negative for the Golgi marker GM130 ( Fig . 1 G ) . In addition , the exosomes were positive for several proteins whose trafficking is regulated by cortactin : the matrix metalloproteinases MMP9 and MT1 - MMP ( Clark et al . , 2007 , 2009 ; Clark and Weaver , 2008 ) and EGFR ( Fig . 1 H ; Timpson et al . , 2005 ) . Because the vesicles were loaded on WB based on equal cell number , KD fractions showed decreased intensity of exosome cargo bands ( Fig . 1 , G – I ) . Cortactin - KD or overexpression likewise decreased or increased exosome secretion by HT1080 fibrosar - coma or MDA - MB - 231 cells , respectively ( Fig . S1 , J – O ) . These data indicate that the level of cortactin expression significantly regulates exosome secretion in cancer cells , both in the positive and negative direction . Cortactin does not control exosome cargo composition To determine whether cortactin controls exosome protein cargo composition , shotgun proteomics was performed on an equal number of exosomes purified from SCC61 - control and cortactin - KD cells . The results were filtered and collated using IDPicker with a target peptide false discovery rate of 5 % and requiring a minimum of two distinct peptides and six spectra per protein identification . This yielded a 4 % protein false discovery rate for the nine MudPIT samples ( three biological replicates each for control , cortactin - KD1 and KD2 exosomes ) . Gene Ontology in UniProt database was used to classify the common exosome proteins ( Fig . 2 A ) . Of the 2 , 102 identified proteins , 2 , 065 were found to be common among all of the three conditions ( Fig . 2 B ) . Comparison of protein abundance was evaluated by spec - tral counting using QuasiTel software ( Li et al . , 2010 ) , which predicted statistically significant differences in the spectral count numbers for detected proteins between control and KD exosomes for only 22 out of the 2 , 102 proteins ( Table S1 ) . Be - cause QuasiTel bases part of its significance estimate on spec - tral count variability across biological replicates , only proteins demonstrating sufficient consistency in detection enable confi - dent quantitative comparisons . Thus , if a substantial number of differentially packaged proteins exist , they are below our abil - ity to reliably quantitate them using this technology platform . As a measure of variability , the coefficient of variation within a group of biological replicates was examined for control and KD - derived exosomes ( Table S1 ) . As expected , proteins with lower spectral counts have higher coefficient of variation values . We also performed WB analyses for candidate proteins , com - paring equal numbers of control and cortactin - KD exosomes ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . As expected from the spectral count analysis , there were no significant differences in EGFR levels in the exo - some preparations . In addition , although our Quasitel analysis identified collagen I and MMP2 as potentially significantly dif - ferent cargoes between control and KD exosomes ( Table S1 ) , they were present at equivalent levels by WB analysis . Notably , MMP2 is a bona fide exosome component as it is not present in the supernatant of conditioned media after 100 , 000 g centrif - ugation to pellet exosomes ( Fig . 2 E ) . These data suggest that cortactin controls exosome number , but not cargo content . Cortactin regulates MVE trafficking Secretion of exosomes could be regulated at several points , in - cluding exosome biogenesis within early endosomes and traf - ficking and secretion of MVEs . Previously , we showed that cortactin - KD cells have a defect in late endosomal ( LE ) traffick - ing and accumulate enlarged LE / lysosomal ( Lys ) compartments ( Sung et al . , 2011 ; Kirkbride et al . , 2012 ; Hong et al . , 2015 ) . Here , we confirmed that SCC61 cortactin - KD cells contain en - larged LE / Lys hybrid organelles by TEM of 50 - nm cell sections ( Fig . 3 A ; Kirkbride et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , we observed in - tact MVE in both control and cortactin - KD cells ( Fig . 3 A ) . We also observed a few vacuole - like structures ( Fig . 3 A and Fig . S2 D , marked with a “V” in KD cell images ) , which in KD cells could represent endosomes that are unable to form intraluminal vesicles ( Baietti et al . , 2012 ; Ghossoub et al . , 2014 ) . To test this possibility , MVE were labeled by allowing control and KD cells to bind and endocytose anti - CD63 antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase before fixation , development with DAB , and processing for TEM . In both control and cortactin - KD cells , DAB staining was concentrated in MVE structures but did not Cortactin promotes exosome secretion • Sinha et al . 199 label the empty vacuoles ( Fig . S2 , A – D ) . These data suggest that the empty vacuoles are not pre - MVE structures and that cortactin is unlikely to affect exosome biogenesis . To further examine the role of cortactin in exosome bio - genesis , we used a light microscopy assay in which expres - sion of Rab5a Q79L promotes enlargement of early - to - late transitioning endosomes ( Stenmark et al . , 1994 ; Baietti et al . , 2012 ) . Within those enlarged endosomes , intraluminal vesicle accumulation is easily visualized by immunostaining for the exosome marker CD63 ( Baietti et al . , 2012 ; Ghossoub et al . , 2014 ) . Analysis of confocal images revealed that control and cortactin - KD cells had an equivalent percent of GFP - Rab5a Q79L - positive endosomes filled with luminal CD63 ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . Together with our finding that cortactin affects the num - ber , but not cargo content , of exosomes ( Figs . 1 and 2 and Fig . S1 ) and that MVEs are present in cortactin - KD cells ( Fig . 3 A and Fig . S2 , A – D ) , these data indicate that cortactin does not affect exosome biogenesis . Figure 1 .

JCB • Volume 214 • NumBer 2 • 2016 200 In both the GFP - RabQ79L experiments ( Fig . 3 B ) and in separate immunostaining experiments ( Fig . 3 , D – F ) , cort - actin - KD cells exhibited enlarged CD63 - positive endosomal structures but did not change the total cell area occupied by CD63 - positive compartments . In addition , confocal imaging of cells expressing GFP - CD63 and the exosome cargo mCherry - MMP9 revealed that MMP9 localized within CD63 - positive endosomes in both control and cortactin - KD cells ( Fig . S3 A ) . These data suggest that cortactin affects MVE traffick - ing downstream of exosome biogenesis , such as transport to or docking at the PM . To determine whether cortactin controls MVE transport , we analyzed the dynamics of GFP - CD63 – positive endosomes by confocal imaging . We found that many GFP - CD63 – positive endosomes were transported to and from the cell periphery in fast , directional movements consistent with microtubule - based transport ( Fig . S3 B and Video 1 ) . Dynamic tracking analy - sis revealed that cortactin - KD cells contained fewer moving GFP - CD63 – positive endosomes compared with control cells ( Fig . S3 , B and C ) . In contrast , a similar number of moving GFP - CD63 – positive endosomes was observed in cortactin - OE and control cells . To analyze MVE speed , diffusion coefficients ( mean square displacement / time , D ) were calculated for indi - vidual endosomes . For both fast - moving ( > 3 µm 2 / s ) and slow - moving ( < 3 µm 2 / s ) endosomes , there was no significant differ - ence in D among control , KD , or overexpressed cells ( Fig . S3 , D and E ) . Although KD cells have a decrease in the number of moving endosomes , the lack of effect of cortactin OE on MVE transport while affecting exosome secretion suggests that cortac - tin controls an additional step in the exosome secretion pathway . In addition to MVE transport , exosome secretion could be affected by alterations in MVE docking or fusion with the Figure 2 . Cortactin does not control exosome cargo selection .

To test this possibility , total internal reflection fluores - cence ( TIRF ) microscopy was performed to visualize MVE docking at the basal surface of cells . TIRF microscopy of cells immunostained with an antibody against CD63 revealed that both cortactin - KD and Rab27a - KD cells exhibited a reduced number of MVEs at the cell – substrate interface compared with control cells ( Fig . 4 , A and B ; and Fig . S4 A ) . Note that the large CD63 - positive endosomes in the center of cortactin - KD cells are likely immature LE / Lys hybrid organelles , as previ - ously characterized ( Kirkbride et al . , 2012 ) . Conversely , cort - actin - overexpressed cells exhibited an increased number of CD63 - positive puncta at the cell – substrate interface . To further examine MVE docking , live TIRF microscopy was performed on cells expressing GFP - CD63 ( Fig . 4 , C – E ; Fig . S4 B ; and Videos 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ) . Because docked vesicles are immobile , live TIRF microscopy imaging is ideal to assess alterations in vesicle docking . Rab27a - KD cells were used as a positive control , because the role of Rab27a in MVE dock - ing was recently defined using this approach ( Ostrowski et al . , 2010 ) . In cells expressing GFP - CD63 , the profile of CD63 - positive endosomes present at the basal surface was similar to that of immunostained cells , with a decrease in cortactin - and Rab27a - KD cells and an increase in cortactin - overexpressed cells compared with control ( Fig . 4 C ) . Furthermore , analysis of movies revealed that Rab27a - and cortactin - KD cells exhibited a decrease in both the percentage and number of MVEs that were immobile for ≥ 5 s ( Fig . 4 , D and E ; and Videos 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ) . Conversely , cortactin - overexpressed cells exhibited no increase in the percentage of immobile MVEs ; however , be - cause of the overall increase in the number of MVEs at the PM , Figure 3 .

JCB • Volume 214 • NumBer 2 • 2016 202 cortactin - overexpressed cells exhibited a large increase in the number of immobile MVEs per cell . In separate experiments using a deeper TIRF angle to allow tracking of MVE movement near the plane of the membrane ( Ostrowski et al . , 2010 ) , indi - vidual MVE movement was tracked and diffusion coefficients were calculated for each MVE as a measurement of motility ( Videos 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 ; and Fig . S4 , C and D ) . As previously re - ported ( Ostrowski et al . , 2010 ) , MVE motility in the TIRF field was significantly increased in Rab27a - KD cells , indicating a docking defect ( Fig . S4 D and Video 9 ) . Similarly , MVE motil - ity was increased in cortactin - KD cells compared with control cells . Although the MVE in cortactin - overexpressed cells were slightly less mobile than control cell MVEs ( Fig . S4 D ) , the dif - ference was not statistically significant , potentially because of the very low mobility of MVEs in both cell types . Overall , these data indicate that cortactin controls MVE docking at the PM . Interaction of cortactin with the Arp2 / 3 complex and F - actin is critical for exosome secretion Cortactin is a unique branched actin regulator that controls actin dynamics by linking the actin nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex to actin filaments via its N terminus ( Kirkbride et al . , 2011 ) . Cort - actin also binds diverse cytoskeletal , membrane trafficking , and signaling proteins at its C terminus . To understand the molecu - lar mechanism by which cortactin controls exosome secretion , we performed a structure – function analysis of cortactin binding interactions required for exosome secretion . shRNA - insensitive WT cortactin or cortactin proteins with mutations in the binding sites for the Arp2 / 3 complex ( W22A ) , actin filaments ( Δ 4RP ) , or SH3 domain – binding partners ( W525K ) or in the Src phos - phorylation sites ( 3Y ; Huang et al . , 1998 ; Weed et al . , 2000 ; Kin - ley et al . , 2003 ; Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) were expressed in cortactin - KD1 cells ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . The number of exosomes secreted by each cell type was quantitated by NanoSight NTA ( Fig . 5 C ) . Expression of WT cortactin , SH3 domain ( W525K ) , or Src phosphorylation site ( 3Y ) mutants fully rescued exosome secretion by KD cells . However , expression of Arp2 / 3 complex ( W22A ) or actin filament ( Δ 4RP ) binding mutants did not res - cue KD cell defects , suggesting that cortactin controls exosome secretion through regulating branched actin dynamics . Consis - tent with this hypothesis , inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex with the drug CK - 666 reduced exosome secretion at concentrations that do not affect cell viability ( Fig . 5 , D and E ) .

Cortactin promotes exosome secretion • Sinha et al . 203 Cortactin , Rab27a , and coronin 1b coordinately control cortical branched actin dynamics and exosome secretion Invadopodia are branched actin - rich structures that are reg - ulated by cortactin and can serve as docking sites for MVEs ( Kirkbride et al . , 2011 ; Hoshino et al . , 2013b ) . Our TIRF exper - iments revealed that both Rab27a and cortactin control MVE docking , presumably by different mechanisms , respectively tethering MVE to existing docking sites ( Ostrowski et al . , 2010 ) and creating new docking sites via branched actin assembly ( Kirkbride et al . , 2011 ) . To test this model , we knocked down Rab27a in cortactin - overexpressed cells and quantitated the rate of exosome secretion ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . Contrary to our expec - tation that loss of Rab27a should reverse the enhanced exosome secretion of cortactin - overexpressed cells , we found no change in exosome secretion . These data suggest that cortactin over - expression may compensate for the lower Rab27a levels and potentially work in the same process . Although control of actin assembly has not been highly studied for Rab27a , Rab27a has been reported to regulate both cortical and endosome - associated actin ( Desnos et al . , 2003 ; Kimura et al . , 2010 ; Yokoyama et al . , 2011 ; Singh et al . , 2013 ) . Notably , two studies demonstrated that Rab27a can control lo - calization of the actin - binding protein coronin to actin assem - blies ( Kimura et al . , 2010 ; Yokoyama et al . , 2011 ) . Because coronin directly antagonizes cortactin at actin branch points ( Cai et al . , 2008 ) , such a mechanism could explain compensa - tory interactions between cortactin and Rab27a . To test whether Rab27a controls coronin localization to invadopodial branched actin assemblies , control , Rab27a - KD , cortactin - overexpressed , and cortactin - overexpressed / Rab27a - KD cells were cultured on FITC - fibronectin ( FN ) / gelatin plates before immunostaining for the common epithelial isoform coronin 1b ( Fig . 7 , A – C ) . Invadopodia are evident as actin - rich puncta that colocalize with dark degraded matrix areas ( Weaver , 2008 ) . As we previ - ously reported ( Hoshino et al . , 2013b ) , Rab27a - KD decreased Figure 6 . Cortactin overexpression compensates for Rab27a loss .

Consis - tent with previous studies of endosome and phagosome actin ( Kimura et al . , 2010 ; Yokoyama et al . , 2011 ) , Rab27a - KD cells had increased intensity of coronin 1b at the remaining inva - dopodial actin puncta ( Fig . 7 , B and C ) . This increase did not occur in cortactin - overexpressed Rab27a - KD cells , suggest - ing that cortactin antagonizes coronin binding to invadopodial branched actin . Consistent with that model , cortactin - KD cells immunostained for coronin 1b exhibited increased coronin flu - orescence intensity at invadopodia , despite no change in actin fluorescence intensity ( Fig . 7 C ; and Fig . S5 , B – D ) . Likewise , KD of coronin 1b in Rab27a - KD cells led to increased cortactin fluorescence intensity at invadopodia , without affecting actin intensity ( Fig . S5 , E – H ) . Coronin 1b - KD in Rab27a - KD cells also led to an increase in both invadopodia activity ( Fig . S5 I ) and exosome secretion ( Fig . 6 B ) . To test whether Rab27a and cortactin affect invadopodial actin stability , control , Rab27a - KD , cortactin - overexpressed and cortactin - overexpressed Rab27a - KD cells were transiently transfected with the actin marker EGFP - F - Tractin . 10 µM latrunculin A was added to cells , and live TIRF microscopy was performed ( Video 10 ) . Because latrunculin A prevents new actin polymerization by sequestering monomeric actin ( Mor - ton et al . , 2000 ) , only disassembly of dynamic actin structures Figure 7 .

Cortactin promotes exosome secretion • Sinha et al . 205 is observed ( Hong et al . , 2015 ) . EGFP - F - Tractin fluorescence was rapidly lost over time in control cells , with a t 1 / 2 of actin intensity loss of 39 s ( Fig . 7 F and Video 10 ) . Invadopodial actin disassembled faster in Rab27a - KD cells than in control cells ( t 1 / 2 = 14 s ) . In both cortactin - overexpressed and cortactin - overexpressed Rab27a - KD cells , the invadopodial actin was much more stable and did not fully disassemble by the end of the movie ( Fig . 7 F and Video 10 ) . Because Rab27a controls coronin localization to invadopodia ( Fig . 7 , A – C ) , we also tested whether coronin KD could reverse the rapid actin dis - assembly that occurs in Rab27a - KD cells . Indeed , KD of coro - nin 1b in Rab27a - KD cells led to more stable actin dynamics , with a similar disassembly rate to that of control cells ( Fig . 7 F ) . These data demonstrate that Rab27a and cortactin coordinately promote cortical actin stability and exosome secretion ; coronin antagonizes these activities . Cortactin - dependent cancer phenotypes are controlled by exosomes Cortactin controls diverse oncogenic traits , including serum and anchorage independence and cellular invasiveness ( Timpson et al . , 2007 ; Weaver , 2008 ; Clark et al . , 2009 ; Kirkbride et al . , 2011 ) . To test the contribution of exosome secretion to cort - actin function in cancer cell aggressiveness , we tested whether adding ultracentrifuge ( UC ) - purified exosomes to cortactin - KD cells could rescue defects in serum independent growth and invasion . For serum - independent growth , control and cortac - tin - KD1 cells were incubated for 4 d in serum - free , growth factor – free media in the presence or absence of 50 µg / ml exo - somes purified from control or cortactin - KD1 cells , before cell counting . This exosome concentration was chosen based on a previous range of 25 – 100 µg / ml shown to modulate cell pro - liferation and migration ( Lee et al . , 2013 ) and represents 35 × 10 8 exosomes per well . As a positive control , Rab27a - KD cells were also tested ( Ostrowski et al . , 2010 ; Bobrie et al . , 2012 ) . As previously reported ( Clark et al . , 2009 ) , cortactin - KD cells proliferate less than control cells under serum - independent con - ditions ( Fig . 8 A , left ) . Consistent with an important role for exosomes in serum - independent growth , Rab27a - KD cells also proliferated less than control cells ( Fig . 8 A , right ) . However , in the presence of UC exosomes , defects in serum - independent growth of cortactin - or Rab27a - KD cells were fully rescued ( Fig . 8 A ) . Consistent with our data that cortactin primarily con - trols exosome number and not cargo content ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) , exo - somes purified from cortactin - KD cells rescued cortactin - KD cell defects to the same extent as an equivalent concentration of control exosomes . Likewise , 50 µg / ml UC - exosomes purified from control or Rab27a - KD cells had equivalent bioactivity . For invasion , 50 µg / ml control or KD UC exosomes was mixed with control or cortactin - KD cells and added to the top of Matrigel - coated Transwell invasion chambers . The protein - ase inhibitor GM6001 was used as a positive control to prevent invasion of control cells ( Fig . 8 B , left ) . After 48 h , cell inva - sion to the bottom of the filter was assessed . Similar to serum independence , defects in Transwell invasion of cortactin - KD and Rab27a - KD cells were equivalently rescued by exosomes derived from either control or KD cells ( Fig . 8 B ) . Because UC preparations of exosomes can contain pro - tein aggregates ( Thery et al . , 2006 ) , we further purified UC exosomes by density gradient ( DG ) sedimentation into a 5 – 40 % iodixanol gradient . WB analysis revealed that exosomes were primarily present in fraction 7 ( Fig . 8 C , DG exosomes ) , consistent with their expected density of ∼ 1 . 11 g / ml ( Greening et al . , 2015 ) . NTA analysis revealed a similar peak size of DG exosomes to that of UC exosomes , although with a slightly more narrow size distribution ( Fig . 8 D ) . TEM images of negatively stained DG exosomes confirmed typical exosome morphology and revealed less background staining than UC exosomes ( com - pare Fig . 8 E to Fig . 1 D ) . To determine whether DG exosomes could rescue se - rum - independent growth defects similarly to UC exosomes , cortactin - KD cells were cultured in serum free media in the presence of various concentrations of UC or DG exosomes for 96 h . Based on the numbers of UC exosomes purified from 48 h conditioned medium , we estimate that control cells secrete ∼ 40 – 50 exosomes per cell per hour ( Fig . 1 B ) . This estimate does not account for exosome uptake by cells or loss during purification . Based on that rate , we calculated that control cells should se - crete ∼ 120 × 10 6 exosomes over a period of 96 h ( Fig . 8 F ) . Hence , we treated cortactin - KD cells with doses ranging from 12 × 10 6 to 120 × 10 6 exosomes for the 96 - h assay ( Fig . 8 G ) . MV were used as a negative control and tested at the highest dose . Serum - independent growth defects of KD cells were fully rescued by coincubation of cells with either UC or DG exo - somes at both the 84 × 10 6 and 120 × 10 6 vesicle concentrations . By contrast , there was no effect of MVs purified from the same conditioned media ( Fig . 8 G ) . Similarly , both UC and DG exo - somes rescued Transwell invasion defects of KD cells , whereas MVs had no effect ( Fig . 8 H ) . Although there was a trend to - ward increased efficacy of UC exosomes in this assay , the dif - ferences were small and not statistically significant . Because the Opti - MEM media that we use to prepare conditioned me - dium and thus exosomes contains growth factors , we also tested whether exosomes purified from growth factor – free media with a 70 min UC step can rescue serum - independent growth of cort - actin - KD cells . Indeed , exosomes purified this way did rescue serum - independent growth , at similar concentrations to UC or DG exosomes purified from Opti - MEM ( Fig . 8 , compare I and G ) . We also tested whether the key invadopodial protein - ase MT1 - MMP is an essential exosome cargo for promoting Transwell invasion . Cortactin - KD cells were incubated with UC exosomes purified from either control or MT1 - MMP - KD cells in Transwell invasion chambers . Surprisingly , we found equivalent activity of control and MT1 - MMP - KD exosomes in rescuing cortactin - KD cell Transwell invasion ( Fig . 8 , J and K ) . These data suggest that other exosome cargoes are either more important or compensate for MT1 - MMP function in this assay . Discussion Secreted exosomes control multiple aspects of cellular func - tion and communication ( Théry , 2011 ; Raposo and Stoorvogel , 2013 ; Yáñez - Mó et al . , 2015 ) . However , the current understand - ing of cellular and molecular mechanisms that control exo - some secretion is limited . We find that the cytoskeletal protein cortactin controls secretion of exosomes but has little effect on their cargo content . Live imaging revealed that cortactin con - trols both LE trafficking and MVE docking . Structure – function analyses identified binding of cortactin to the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments as critical for exosome secretion . Further investigation revealed that cortactin , Rab27a , and coronin 1b coordinately control branched actin dynamics at cortical inv - adopodial MVE docking sites and exosome secretion ( Fig . 9 ) .

Cortactin promotes exosome secretion • Sinha et al . 207 Functionally , purified exosomes fully rescue cortactin - KD cell defects in serum - independent growth and Transwell invasion . Exosome secretion occurs when MVEs fuse with the PM . An alternative fate for exosomes is degradation after MVE fu - sion with lysosomes . How the balance between secretion and degradation is regulated is unclear . We previously found that in - vadopodia are key docking sites for MVEs and that the number of invadopodia can control the number of exosomes secreted from cells ( Hoshino et al . , 2013b ) . In this new study , we in - vestigated the role of cortactin , which regulates branched actin assembly on both late endosomes ( Hong et al . , 2015 ) and at invadopodial MVE docking sites ( Hoshino et al . , 2013b ) . Our studies with KD cells indicate that cortactin controls both the number of moving MVEs and the number of PM docking sites , whereas overexpression of cortactin only affects MVE dock - ing . The trafficking data ( Fig . S3 ) together with our previous studies ( Sung et al . , 2011 ; Kirkbride et al . , 2012 ; Hong et al . , 2015 ) suggest that cortactin plays an essential role in LE matu - ration , such that cortactin loss leads to LE / Lys dysfunction and decreased numbers of MVEs that can be trafficked to the PM . Because cortactin - overexpressed cells did not affect MVE traf - ficking and only regulated MVE docking , we focused on that phenotype for further in - depth studies . We found that control of branched actin assembly is critical to create MVE docking sites . Numerous membrane trafficking pathways are controlled by Rab GTPases ( Stenmark , 2009 ) . Among them , Rab27a is a critical MVE docking factor ( Ostrowski et al . , 2010 ) . Rab27a also regulates peripheral capture and docking of other LE / Lys organelles , such as melanosomes and T cell granules ( Hume et al . , 2001 ; Marks and Seabra , 2001 ; Wu et al . , 2001 ; Jordens et al . , 2006 ; Ménasché et al . , 2008 ) . As Rabs function through mul - tiple effectors , it is likely that the process of exosome secretion requires multiple events . For example , the synaptotagmin - like proteins Slp4 and Slp2a control exosome secretion from HeLa cells and T cell granule exocytosis ( Ménasché et al . , 2008 ; Os - trowski et al . , 2010 ) and likely link Rab27a - bound organelles to the PM . Likewise , Rab27a binding to MyoVa allows off - load - ing of LE / Lys organelles from microtubules to peripheral actin assemblies ( Hume et al . , 2001 ; Marks and Seabra , 2001 ; Wu et al . , 2001 ; Jordens et al . , 2006 ) . Our data indicate that Rab27a has an additional function in docking , which is to regulate actin dynamics at cortical docking sites by preventing coronin 1b localization ( Fig . 9 ) . This might occur by the GDP - form of Rab27a sequestering coronin ( Kimura et al . , 2010 ) , whereas the GTP form promotes tethering via SLPs ( Ostrowski et al . , 2010 ) . The role of cortical actin in vesicle docking and fusion is not well understood ( Eitzen , 2003 ; Cingolani and Goda , 2008 ) . On one hand , cortical actin must be disassembled for vesicles to access and bind the PM ( Porat - Shliom et al . , 2013 ) . On the other hand , actin meshworks are known to promote vesicle docking ( Eitzen , 2003 ) . Cortical actin docking sites may cap - ture vesicles by connecting to other cytoskeletal elements , in - cluding unconventional myosins carrying vesicles or by linking to microtubules , which are major vesicle transport highways . They may also act as signaling platforms that facilitate vesi - cle docking and fusion by creating specialized lipid domains ( Fratti et al . , 2004 ; Regazzi , 2007 ; Gabel et al . , 2015 ) . Invado - podia have all of these features : dynamic actin assembly , mi - crotubule capture , and concentration of phosphoinositides , lipid raft components , and other signaling molecules ( Murphy and Courtneidge , 2011 ; Hoshino et al . , 2013a ) . At this point , the full mechanism of how dynamic invadopodial actin promotes MVE docking is not clear ; however , our data indicate that actin stabilization is a key regulatory point . Structure – function analysis of cortactin revealed that binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments is critical for control of exosome secretion . These data are consistent with our finding that molecules that regulate actin stability also control exosome secretion . Surprisingly , neither the Src phosphoryla - tion sites nor the SH3 binding domain of cortactin were nec - essary for exosome secretion . Although these moieties could be considered regulatory sites , Src phosphorylation of cortac - tin has been shown to regulate actin dynamics in breast cancer cell invadopodia through binding of cofilin and Nck1 ( Oser et al . , 2009 , 2010 ; Kirkbride et al . , 2011 ) . In addition , the SH3 domain of cortactin binds key invadopodia regulators N - WASp Figure 9 . Model for regulation of exosome secre - tion by cortactin , Rab27a , and coronin . ( A ) Cortical branched actin helps create MVE docking sites , such as invadopodia ( Hoshino et al . , 2013b ) at the PM . ( B ) Cortactin stabilizes branched actin ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) , which enhances MVE docking . ( C ) Coronin antagonizes cortactin at actin branch points ( Cai et al . , 2008 ) , leading to destabilization of actin branches and fewer MVE docking sites . Rab27a opposes this antagonism by inhibiting coronin bind - ing to invadopodia - associated actin ( Fig . 6 , C – E ) , potentially by sequestration ( Kimura et al . , 2010 ; Yokoyama et al . , 2011 ) . JCB • Volume 214 • NumBer 2 • 2016 208 and dynamin ( Kirkbride et al . , 2011 ) , and we previously found that inhibition of N - WASp reduces both invadopodia formation and exosome secretion ( Hoshino et al . , 2013b ) . As N - WASp and dynamin have numerous protein and phospholipid binding partners ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ; Ferguson and De Ca - milli , 2012 ) , we speculate that cortactin is not essential in our cells to recruit them to invadopodia ; however , it is likely that these cortactin - binding interactions are key in many cells , de - pending on the signaling and cytoskeletal state . Cortactin is known to regulate aggressive cancer cell traits , including tumor growth , cancer cell invasion and motil - ity , and serum - and anchorage - independent growth ( Kirkbride et al . , 2011 ) . The mechanisms by which cortactin controls many of these functions are unclear but could involve in situ control of cytoskeletal motility structures , secretion , or signaling ( Kirk - bride et al . , 2011 ) . Our finding that cortactin - KD cell defects in serum - independent growth and Transwell invasion can be rescued by incubation with physiological levels of purified exo - somes suggests that regulation of exosome secretion may be a key mechanism by which cortactin promotes tumor aggressive - ness . Thus , exosomes could contribute growth and angiogenic factors to promote tumor cell survival and in vivo growth as well as proteinases or extracellular matrix molecules to promote cel - lular invasiveness ( Hoshino et al . , 2013b ; Wendler et al . , 2013 ; Sung et al . , 2015 ; Young et al . , 2015 ) . Our MT1 - MMP - KD ex - periments suggest that MT1 - MMP is not an essential exosome cargo for invasion through Matrigel , but that does not rule out activities of other proteinases . Indeed , multiple cargoes may act synergistically to promote exosome - induced phenotypes . An important future direction will be to fully explore the contribu - tion of exosome secretion and specific exosome cargoes to the promotion of tumor aggressiveness by cortactin . In summary , cortactin promotes exosome secretion from cancer cells by regulating branched actin stability . Our data sug - gest that modulation of branched actin dynamics is a critical control point for MVE docking and exosome secretion .

Isolation of exosomes from conditioned medium SCC61 and HT1080 cells were cultured to 80 % confluence for 48 h in Opti - MEM ( except for Fig . 5 D , which was for 24 h , or for Fig . 7 I , which used DMEM for 48 h ) . Conditioned media was subjected to serial centrif - ugation to respectively sediment live cells ( 300 g for 10 min ) , dead cells ( 2 , 000 g [ 4 , 000 rpm in Ti45 rotor ] for 30 min ) , microvesicles ( 10 , 000 g for 30 min [ 9 , 300 rpm in Ti45 ] ) , and UC exosomes ( 100 , 000 g [ 30 , 000 rpm in Ti45 ] for 18 h or 70 min ) . For further purification of UC exosomes by density gradient , a discontinuous iodixanol gradient was prepared . Solutions ( 40 % wt / vol , 20 % wt / vol , 10 % wt / vol , and 5 % wt / vol ) of io - dixanol were made by diluting OptiPrep ( 60 % wt / vol aqueous iodixanol ; Axis - Shield PoC ) with 0 . 25 M sucrose / 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , from the bottom to the top of a 14 × 89 – mm polyallomer tube .

Imaris image processing software ( Bitplane ) was used to track CD63 - positive MVEs from the confocal images to determine mean squared displacement of each MVE . A defined area located away from the nuclear region of each cell was selected for analysis ( see represen - tative tracks within the areas in Fig . S3 B ) . Endosomes > 2 µm in size were excluded from the analysis . The autoregressive model algorithm was used and the tracks were generated . Diffusion coefficients ( D ; given as micrometers squared ) were calculated from the tracks . For TIRF live - cell imaging , cells were plated on dishes coated with 25 µg / ml fibronectin . After 24 h , images were captured every 100 ms for 30 s . For the shallow TIRF movies , imaging was per - formed with a standard laser angle to observe only fluorescence present at the cell – substrate interface , whereas for the deeper TIRF movies , the depth of penetration was calculated to be up to 1 µm from the PM using fluorescent 5 - μμ bead standards ( FS05F ; Bangs Laboratories ) . For TIRF imaging of fixed immunostained cells , im - ages were captured with a standard laser angle to observe CD63 puncta present at the cell – substrate interface . Secondary antibodies for cortactin and CD63 were tagged with Alexa Fluor 546 and 488 , respectively . For visualizing actin turnover at invadopodia , cells tran - siently transfected with eGFP - F - Tractin were treated with 10 µM latrunculin A ( L5163 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) and TIRF images were cap - tured every 20 ms for 2 min . TIRF image analysis . For all TIRF analyses of MVEs , the center of the cell was excluded by drawing a circle , such as that as shown in Fig . 4 A . The remaining area , which is ∼ 15 – 20 µm from the cell pe - riphery , was used for the analysis . For quantification of docked MVEs in TIRF fixed - cell experiments , automated thresholding in Speckle Tracker plugin in Fiji was used to identify MVEs . Thresholding was based only on intensity not on vesicle size . MVE number and cell area data were exported to Excel for calculation of MVE number / area . For shallow TIRF movies , the levels for all movies were all reduced to the same level to lower nonspecific background . Then automated thresh - olding in Speckle Tracker plugin in Fiji was used to identify MVEs . Mobile MVEs were defined as MVE that had a change in x , y coordi - nates . Immobile MVEs defined in the graph were those that were im - mobile for ≥ 5 s . In deeper TIRF movies , MVEs were manually selected using Speckle Tracker plugin feature . The data generated was further processed using Count Speckle Displacement plugin in Fiji to deter - mine the number of MVEs as well as calculate diffusion coefficients . For analysis of actin turnover in invadopodia from TIRF movies , Im - ageJ plugin Intensity versus time monitor was used to determine actin fluorescence intensity at invadopodia for 4 × 4 – pixel areas . A separate 4 × 4 – pixel area outside of each invadopodia was selected to determine the background fluorescence intensity . The specific invadopodia actin fluorescence intensity was determined by subtracting the neighboring cytoplasmic background intensity from the total invadopodia actin fluorescence intensity . The data were then normalized to the frame at which Latrunculin A was added . GraphPad Prism version 6 was used to plot the data and nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine the half - life of actin fluorescence intensity decay . Serum - independent growth assay On day 1 , 25 , 000 cells were seeded in six - well dishes in medium con - taining serum . The next day , cells were washed three times with PBS . Se - rum - free media with or without the addition of exosomes was then added . After 4 d , cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer . Transwell invasion assay 25 , 000 cells were seeded on the top of BD Biocoat Matrigel - coated invasion chambers ( 8 . 0 - µm pore size for 24 - well plates ) in the presence of 2 . 5 % exosome - depleted serum in DMEM on both sides of the filter . When added , exosomes derived from control or KD cells were added together with the cells on the topside of the filter . 48 h later , cells were removed from the top of the filter using cotton swabs before staining for cells that had migrated to the bottom of the filter ( Hematology stain - ing kit ; Richard Allen Scientific ) . Five bright - field images per insert were taken using an Eclipse TE2000 - E microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with a 20× Plan - Fluor 0 . 3 NA objective . Cells per image were counted and averaged per replicate . Invadopodia assay 50 , 000 cells were seeded on 35 - mm MatTek dishes coated with 10 µM FITC - FN / 2 % cross - linked gelatin , prepared as previously described ( Clark and Weaver , 2008 ) . Cells were cultured in invadopodia media ( 1 : 1 ratio of DMEM and RPMI media containing 10 % FBS [ HyClone ] , 5 % Nuserum [ Gibco ] , and 20 ng / ml EGF [ Invitrogen ] ) for 18 h be - fore fixing and immunostaining . Cells were fixed with 4 % PFA for 10 min , permeabilized using 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in 3 % BSA for 10 min , blocked with 3 % BSA for 20 min . Cells were then incubated overnight with anti - coronin 1b ( 1 : 250 ) at 4°C . The next day , cells were incu - bated with Rhodamine - Phalloidin ( 1 : 2 , 000 ) and secondary Alexa Fluor 633 ( 1 : 500 ) for 1 h at room temperature . Invadopodia plates were then mounted in antifade mounting reagent before imaging . Functional inv - adopodia , indicated by dark holes in the fluorescent matrix ( FITC - FN ) colocalized with actin puncta , were analyzed for absolute intensity of coronin 1b or actin within a boxed area of 4 × 4 pixels surrounding the actin puncta . A similar procedure was done for cortactin immunostain - ing , except that the cells were plated on Alexa Fluor 633 / FN and the secondary antibody for cortactin was conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 . EM For negative staining of purified exosomes , Formvar carbon film – coated grids ( FCF - 200 - Cu ; Electron Microscopy Sciences ) were washed in double distilled water , followed by 100 % ethanol . For each step , excess liquid was removed by wicking with filter paper . 10 - µl samples were added to grids for 5 min . Grids were immediately stained with 2 % phosphotungstic acid , pH 6 . 1 , for 20s and allowed to dry over - night . Grids were imaged using a FEI Tecnai T12 TEM ( 120 kV LaB6 source ) , Gatan cryotransfer stage , and AMT XR41 - S side - mounted 2K × 2K CCD camera , 2102 SC . All exosome images were collected at 50 , 000× with an Advanced Microscopy Techniques CCD camera . TEM of whole unlabeled cells was performed as previously de - scribed ( Kirkbride et al . , 2012 ) . For visualization of CD63 - positive MVEs , SCC61 control and cortactin - KD1 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with anti - CD63 antibody ( ab8219 ; Abcam ) labeled with HRP ( Z 25054 ; Molecular Probes ) . Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed for 1 h in 3 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate ( NaCaC ) buffer . After several washes in 0 . 1 M NaCaC , cells were in - cubated with DAB ( EMS Chemical ) in 0 . 05 M Tris - HCl at pH 7 . 6 . The JCB • Volume 214 • NumBer 2 • 2016 210 enzymatic reaction was started by adding H 2 O 2 to a final concentra - tion of 0 . 01 % and allowed to proceed for 30 min . The cells were washed three times with 0 . 05 M Tris - HCl buffer . After a brief wash with water , cells were washed three times with 0 . 1 M NaCaC buffer . The cells were then postfixed with 1 % osmium tetroxide in 0 . 1 M NaCaC buffer , then washed with 0 . 1 M NaCaC buffer . Next , cells were scraped and pelleted , resuspended in 0 . 1 M NaCaC buffer , and washed with water . The cells were then incubated with 1 % uranyl acetate ( en bloc ) for 10 min . Next , cells were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series ( 30 % , 50 % , 75 % , 85 % , and 95 % ) for 15 min each . Cells were further dehydrated with 100 % ethanol and propylene oxide ( PO ) . After this , cells were infiltrated with a 3 : 1 mixture of PO and epoxy resin for 30 min then 1 : 1 ratio of PO and resin for 1 h and subsequently overnight . The next day , samples were infiltrated with 1 : 3 mixture of PO and resin followed by six changes of pure resin for 36 h . Then the pellet was embedded for 48 h in epoxy resin at 60°C . Sections ( 70 nm ) were collected on copper grids and cells were counterstained with 2 % uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead ci - trate . Samples were imaged on FEI / Tecnai 12 electron microscope at various magnifications . Mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography MS / MS analysis Shotgun proteomic analysis of purified exosomes was performed by first resuspending the exosomes in LDS sample buffer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , resolving the proteins ∼ 1 cm using a 10 % Novex precast gel , and then performing in - gel tryptic digestion to recover peptides . The peptides were analyzed via MudPIT ( Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology ) essentially as described earlier ( MacCoss et al . , 2002 ; Martinez et al . , 2012 ) . In brief , digested peptides were loaded onto a biphasic precolumn consisting of 4 cm of reversed - phase ( RP ) material followed by 4 cm of strong cation - exchange material . Once loaded , the column was placed in line with a 20 - cm RP analytical column packed into a nanospray emitter tip directly coupled to a linear ion trap mass spectrometer ( LTQ ) . A subset of peptides was eluted from the strong cation - exchange material onto the RP analytical via a pulse of volatile salt , separated by an RP gradient and then ionized directly into the mass spectrometer where both the intact masses ( mass spectrometry [ MS ] ) and fragmentation patters ( MS / MS ) of the peptides were collected . The peptide spectral data were used to query a protein database using Sequest ( Yates et al . , 1995 ) and the resulting identifications were collated and filtered using IDPicker ( Ma et al . , 2009 ) and Scaffold ( http : / / www . proteomesoftware . com ) . Relative protein abundances and statistical significance of differences were evaluated via spectral counting techniques using the Quasitel program ( Li et al . , 2010 ) . Quasitel uses a quasi - Poisson likelihood model to obtain multiple testing corrected p - value calculations , based on both spectral count consistency across biological replicates and the magnitude of the differences between experimental and control groups ( Li et al . , 2010 ) . Protein groups were classified using UniProt database and a Venn diagram was made using Microsoft Excel for Mac 2011 , version 14 . 4 . 8 . Data analysis and statistics For both quantitated data and representative images from experi - ments , the n value and independent experiment numbers are listed in the figure legends . For nonquantitated WBs ( e . g . , checking knock - down or overexpression ) , they were generally performed a single time . All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22 , and graphs were generated in Prism GraphPad version 5 or 6 . All data were first tested for normality using a Kolmogorov – Smirnov normality test . Parametric data were analyzed by a two - tailed t test and plotted with bar graphs showing mean ± standard error ( SE ) or scatterplots showing the mean . Data that were nonparametric were analyzed by Mann – Whitney U test and plotted using box and whis - kers plots , where the median is shown as a line , the box indicates 25 – 75th percentile , and the whiskers indicate 5 – 95th percentile or scatterplots showing the median .
