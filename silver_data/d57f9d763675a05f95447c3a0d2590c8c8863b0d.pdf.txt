We really appreciate your consideration of our manuscript . We were able to recompose more sophisticated figures with Mr . Andreas Schober ( CTR - Editorial Office ) suggestions . Following his suggestions , we revised our manuscript and adjusted the legends to the new figures . We hope that the figures and the edited manuscript have improved in such a manner that it can now be considered acceptable for publication . On behalf of all the authors , I would like to ask you to consider our revised manuscript entitled ”Podocin is translocated to cytoplasm in Puromycin Aminonucleoside Nephrosis rats and in poor prognosis patients with IgA nephropathy” for publication in Cell and Tissue Research as an original research article . In this pathology study we investigated about glomerulonephritis , focusing on podocyte injury . All study participants provided informed consent , and the study design was approved by our institute’s ethics review board . Glomerulonephritis produces various symptoms and also has different reactions to treatments . We focused on the staining gap of podocytes proteins : podocin and synaptopodin . Our results showed that the podocin and synaptopodin staining pattern was different , especially in irreversible glomerulonephritis , and we also found that podocin was translocated to the cytosol of podocytes by endocytosis . We feel that the findings from this study will be of special interest to the readers of Cell and Tissue Research .

Podocyte injury results in progressive 31 glomerular damage and accelerates sclerotic changes , although the exact 32 mechanism of podocyte injury is still obscure . We focused on the staining gap 33 ( podocin gap ) defined as the staining difference between podocin and synaptopodin , 34 which are normally located in the foot process . In puromycin aminonucleoside 35 nephrosis rats , the podocin gap is significantly increased ( p < 0 . 05 ) and podocin is 36 translocated to the cytoplasm on days 7 and 14 but not on day 28 . Surprisingly , the 37 gap is also significantly increased ( p < 0 . 05 ) in human kidney biopsy specimens of 38 poor prognosis IgA nephropathy patients . This suggests that the podocin gap could 39 be a useful marker for classifying the prognosis of IgA nephropathy and indicating 40 the translocation of podocin to the cytoplasm . Next , we found more evidence of 41 podocin trafficking in podocytes where podocin merged with Rab5 in puromycin 42 aminonucleoside nephrosis rats at day14 . In immunoelectron microscopy , the 43 podocin positive area was significantly translocated from the foot process areas to 44 the cytoplasm ( p < 0 . 05 ) on days 7 and 14 in puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis 45 rats . Interestingly , podocin is also translocated to the cytoplasm in poor - prognosis 46 human IgA nephropathy . 47 In this paper , we demonstrated that the translocation of podocin by 48 endocytosis could be a key traffic event of critical podocyte injury and that the 49 podocin gap could indicate the prognosis of IgA nephropathy . 50 Page 3 of 37 Cell and Tissue Research 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w 51 Page 4 of 37 Cell and Tissue Research 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w [ Introduction ] 52 Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells constituting an essential part of 53 the glomerular filtration barrier . Their interdigitated foot processes , connected by a 54 slit diaphragm ( SD ) , together with fenestrated endothelial cells and an intervening 55 basement membrane , form the filtration barrier . The importance of podocyte 56 integrity in the pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome is best illustrated by the 57 identification of human diseases causing mutations in genes encoding nephrin , 58 podocin , and CD2AP that span and stitch together foot processes of neighboring 59 podocytes ( 1 – 3 ) . 60 In the podocyte , podocin localizes in the SD , where it is assumed to act as 61 an intercellular scaffold protein , assembling SD components in lipid raft associated 62 microdomains ( 4 , 5 ) . Podocin is a membrane - attached protein and it is predicted to 63 form a hairpin - like structure , with both N - and C - terminuses residing in the 64 cytoplasm ( 6 ) . NPHS2 mutations cause several diseases with an interference of 65 podocin intercellular trafficking ( 7 ) . 66 In mammalian cells , endocytosis is mediated via two principal routes , i . e . 67 clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) and clathrin - independent , raft - mediated 68 endocytosis ( RME ) ( 8 ) . CME targets proteins to the early endosome , a sorting 69 station directing vesicles to either recycling or degradation . Besides this classic 70 CME pathway , RME has recently been the focus of intensive research , uncovering 71 the new concept that the microdomain itself behaves as a vehicle for 72 internalization . RME is generally defined by its clathrin independence , cholesterol 73 sensitivity , and a typical morphology of smooth invaginations ( 9 ) . 74 Shono et al . demonstrated that podocin co - localizes with the coxsaxie virus 75 and adeno virus receptor ( CAR ) and with ZO - 1 at the tight junction between foot 76 Page 5 of 37 Cell and Tissue Research 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w processes in puromycin aminonucleoside ( PA ) nephrosis ( PAN ) rat kidneys and 77 podocin facilitated the coalescence of lipid rafts containing CAR , and makes 78 dynamic cytoskeletal arrangement ( 10 ) . They also demonstrated that podocin and 79 CAR exhibit a diffuse punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm in both proteins’ 80 co - transfected COS - 7 cells . 81 Regarding PAN , the intraperitoneal injection of PA to rats is an 82 experimental model characterized by massive proteinuria and by marked 83 morphological changes in podocytes , including the effacement of foot processes 84 their focal adhesion with Bowman’s capsules and the focal detachment from the 85 GBM ( 11 – 13 ) . Thus , PA - induced nephrosis is regarded as an experimental model of 86 human nephrotic syndrome and glomerulosclerosis . 87 In this paper , we have demonstrated that podocin is translocated to the 88 cytoplasm by endocytosis in both the PAN rat model and in poor - prognosis human 89 immunoglobulin A nephropathy ( IgAN ) specimens using the difference in the 90 staining of podocin and synaptopodin ( synpo ) . This novel approach shows that 91 podocin is translocated to the cytoplasm in the human nephropathy specimens and 92 may help advance the understanding of podocin endocytosis . 93 94 Page 6 of 37 Cell and Tissue Research 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w [ Materials & Methods ] 95 Antibodies Antibodies Antibodies Antibodies 96 The monoclonal mouse anti - synaptopodin antibody ( Progen , Heidelberg , 97 Germany ) , Alexa 488 conjugated donkey anti - rabbit IgG antiserum ( Invitrogen , 98 California , USA ) , Alexa 555 conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG antiserum ( Invitrogen , 99 California , USA ) , mouse monoclonal Rab5 antibody ( # 50523 Abcam , Japan ) and 100 the 5 nm colloidal - gold - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG antiserum ( heavy and 101 light ) ( BB international , Cardiff , UK ) were purchased for immunohistochemistry 102 and / or immunoelectron microscopy . Polyclonal rabbit anti - podocin antiserum has 103 been described previously ( 6 ) . 104 105 Experimental animals Experimental animals Experimental animals Experimental animals 106 Adult male Sprague - Dawley rats ( weighing about 200 g ) were obtained 107 from Sankyo laboratory service ( Tokyo , Japan ) . 108 For PAN , a single dose ( 15 mg / 100 g BW ) of PA ( Sigma , St . Louis , USA ) 109 was injected intraperitoneally into the rats to induce a nephrotic state , as 110 described previously ( 14 , 15 ) . These rats were housed under specific pathogen free 111 ( SPF ) conditions using individual metabolic cages with free access to standard 112 chow and drinking water . 24 - hour urine was collected once a week throughout the 113 experiments . Urinary albumin , urinary total protein , and creatinine were 114 measured by the same methods as clinical examination . All experiments were 115 performed according to the guidelines of the Committee on Animal Experiments of 116 Juntendo University , Tokyo , Japan . 117 Three rats per group were sacrificed at 0 , 4 , 7 , 14 , and 28 days after PA 118 injection . After the rats were anesthetized with Pentobarbital sodium ( 100 mg / kg , 119 Page 7 of 37 Cell and Tissue Research 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma , Osaka , Japan ) , they were perfused via the 120 abdominal aorta with a PLP fixative buffer ( 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0 . 1 M lysine ) . 121 After perfusional fixation , the kidneys were removed and processed for 122 immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy . Tissue slices were filled in 123 Tissue - Tek O . C . T . compound ( Sakura Finetek , USA ) , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and 124 then stored at −80 °C prior to immunofluorescence . 125 126 Human Tissue Samples Human Tissue Samples Human Tissue Samples Human Tissue Samples 127 For specimens of human IgA nephritis , tissue samples were obtained from 128 the samples of diagnostic renal biopsies performed at Juntendo University Hospital 129 with the permission of the Ethics Committee on Human Research of Juntendo 130 University Faculty of Medicine . We investigated the samples from four groups of 131 four patients , IgAN - good , IgAN - relatively - good ( IgAN - r - good ) , IgAN - relatively - poor 132 ( IgAN - r - poor ) , IgAN - poor , who had IgA nephropathy diagnosed according to the 133 second guideline of IgA nephropathy ( 16 ) . As control human samples , we used 134 biopsy samples from patients with minor glomerular abnormalities ( N = 4 ) . 135 136 ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence 137 For the immunofluorescent staining of rat kidneys , 4 µm thick sections on 138 sillan - coated slide glass were washed in PBS and incubated with a blocking 139 solution . A double immunofluorescent staining for podocin and synpo was then 140 performed and the secondary antibodies were incubated . 141 Human kidney biopsy specimens were stored at −80 ˚C for 142 immunofluorescence . The 4 µm thick sections were fixed with cold acetone for 5 143 min , washed with PBS , incubated with a blocking solution , and then a double 144 Page 8 of 37 Cell and Tissue Research 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w immunofluorescent staining for podocin and synpo was performed using the same 145 methodology as with the PAN rats . These sections were photographed under a 146 confocal laser microscope ( Olympus FV1000 , Tokyo , Japan ) . 147 To examine the podocin gap , or the staining gap between the area of 148 podocin and synpo , at least 50 mid - sections of podocin and synpo areas were 149 carefully measured using a digitizer KS - 400 Imaging System as described 150 previously ( 17 ) and the podocin gap was calculated using the following formula : 151 podocin gap ( % ) = ( podocin fluorescent staining area − synpo fluorescent staining 152 area ) / area of each glomerulus × 100 . 153 154 Immunoelectron microscopy Immunoelectron microscopy Immunoelectron microscopy Immunoelectron microscopy 155 Animals were perfused with physiological saline and subsequently with a 156 PLP fixative . The perfused kidneys were cut into small pieces , and immersed in the 157 same fixative for 30 min . The samples were dehydrated with a graded series of 158 ethanol and embedded in an LR - white resin ( London Resin , Berkshire , UK ) ( 18 ) . 159 Ultrathin gold sections of the LR - white - resin - embedded samples were produced 160 with a diamond knife and transferred to nickel grids ( 150 mesh ) that had been 161 coated with a Formvar membrane . After blocking with a 1 % normal goat serum in 162 PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) , the sections were incubated overnight with the anti - podocin 163 antiserum ( 1 : 50 ) diluted with 1 % BSA in PBS at 4 ˚C for 12 hours . Subsequently 164 they were incubated with colloidal - gold - conjugated secondary antibodies ( BBI , 165 Cardiff , UK ) diluted 1 : 100 with 1 % BSA in PBS for one hour at room temperature , 166 contrasted with 4 % uranyl acetate for 5 min , and observed with an H7100 167 transmission electron microsope ( Hitachi High - Technologies , Tokyo , Japan ) . The 168 primary antibodies were omitted from the incubation solution as a negative control , 169 Page 9 of 37 Cell and Tissue Research 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w and no non - specific staining of the secondary antibody was found in the kidney 170 sections . 171 To confirm the alteration of localization of podocin in PAN rats , pictures 172 from at least 15 podocyte cell bodies from each day were taken after an 173 immunoelectron microscopic study . The immunogold podocin particles in the 174 podocyte cell body were counted . 175 To examine the localization of podocin in human IgAN , tissues were taken 176 with needle biopsy . Small cortical pieces were incubated in a PLP fixative buffer 177 for a few hours and embedded in LR - white , the same as with the rat kidney tissues . 178 179 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis Statistical analysis Statistical analysis 180 All values are means + SEM . Statistical significance ( defined as P < 0 . 05 ) 181 was evaluated using Stat View followed by the Fisher’s paired least significant 182 difference t test . 183 184 [ Results ] 185 PAN rats showed significant proteinuria 186 A single intraperitoneal injection of PAN produces overt proteinuria on 187 days 4 to 28 ( Fig . 1 ) . We compared the levels of proteinuria at each time point from 188 day 0 . All time points , or days 4 , 7 , 14 , and 28 , showed significant proteinuria ( p < 189 0 . 001 ) . On day 28 , the levels of proteinuria had decreased from the peak levels 190 observed on day 14 . 191 192 PAN rats showed a difference in the staining of podocin and synpo on days 7 and 193 14 194 Page 10 of 37 Cell and Tissue Research 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w Although on days 4 and 7 the expression of podocin and synpo were 195 decreased , they were recovered on days 14 and 28 ( Fig . 2a - e ) . The expression of 196 podocin seemed to follow a linear pattern ( similar to the glomerular basement 197 membrane : GBM type ) on days 4 and 7 , and a podocyte cell body pattern on days 198 14 and 28 . On the other hand , the linear staining of synpo did not change during 199 the period from day 4 to 28 . On day 0 , the staining pattern of podocin and synpo 200 were almost matched ( Fig . 2a ) . On days 7 – 14 , the area of podocin seemed to be 201 translocated to the cell body area from the foot process area , however synpo stayed 202 in the foot process area ( Fig . 2c , d ) . 203 On day 28 their merged area was relocated to the foot process area ( Fig . 204 2e ) . To confirm the difference of the podocin - synpo area , we calculated the podocin 205 gap ( ref . materials and methods ) with the use of computer software by subtracting 206 the synpo area from the podocin area , and dividing the total by the glomerulus 207 area ( Fig . 2f ) . On days 7 – 14 the podocin gap was significantly increased ( p < 0 . 05 ) 208 and on day 28 the area returned to the same size as measured on day 0 . 209 210 Podocin was translocated to the cytoplasm of PAN rats at day 14 211 In the immunoelectron microscopy of PAN rats , immunoreactive podocin 212 was recognized by gold particles ( Fig . 3a , b , c : low magnification ×8000 – 20000 , 3a’ , 213 b’ , c’ : high magnification ×10000 – 50000 ) . On day 0 , podocin was recognized at the 214 slit diaphragm insertion sites of foot processes ( Fig . 3a , day 0 ) . On day 7 , the 215 structure of the slit diaphragm was destroyed and the podocin was translocated to 216 the cell bodies of the podocytes ( Fig . 3b , day 7 ) . On day 14 , through staining , 217 podocin was seen in the vesicular structures in the cell bodies of podocytes ( Fig . 3c , 218 day 14 ) . This data indicates that the podocin was translocated to the cell body , 219 Page 11 of 37 Cell and Tissue Research 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w likely by endocytosis . 220 By counting the number of gold particles in the cytoplasm of the podocytes , we 221 could detect significantly more podocin in the cytoplasm on days 7 and 14 , as 222 compared to day 0 ( Fig . 3d , p < 0 . 05 ) . 223 224 The podocin gap was significantly increased in IgAN - poor prognosis specimens 225 Each of the four IgAN groups consisted of four samples that were stained 226 with podocin and synpo ( Fig . 4a - e ) . In the IgAN - good group , the podocin and synpo 227 stained areas were consistently similar to day 0 in PAN rats ( Fig . 4b , IgAN - good ) . 228 In the IgAN - r - good group the level of expression was decreased , but both of them 229 were merged completely ( Fig . 4c , IgAN - r - good ) . In the IgAN - r - poor group , there 230 was no evident change from the IgAN - good group ( Fig . 4d , IgAN - r - poor ) . 231 Surprisingly , in the IgAN - poor group , podocin was stained in the cell bodies of 232 podocytes and there was a clear difference in the staining pattern between podocin 233 and synpo . This result suggests the translocation of podocin to the cytoplasm . We 234 also measured the podocin gap in each human biopsy sample from IgAN ( Fig . 4f ) 235 using the previously mentioned software . The podocin gap was not altered in the 236 IgAN - r - good and IgAN - r - poor groups when compared to the control group . However , 237 in the IgAN - poor group it was significantly increased ( p < 0 . 05 ) when compared to 238 the area of the IgAN - r - good group , indicating that podocin translocated to the cell 239 bodies of podocytes . 240 241 Podocin was translocated to the cytoplasm in IgAN poor prognosis specimens 242 Next we performed immunoelectron microscopy using an anti - podocin 243 antibody in kidney biopsy specimens of minor glomerular injury and IgAN - poor 244 Page 12 of 37 Cell and Tissue Research 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w specimens ( Fig . 5a - c ) . Podocin was located in the SD area of the control specimen . 245 On the other hand , in the IgAN - poor biopsy specimens , the structure of the foot 246 processes was destroyed and podocin was translocated to cytoplasm area ( Fig . 5b , c , 247 IgAN - poor ) . 248 249 Podocin was translocated to the cytoplasm by the endocytosis pathway 250 As we mentioned above before , at day14 of PAN rats podocin was 251 translocated to the cell body area from foot processes . To check this translocation 252 mechanism , we stained PAN rats specimens at day 14 with podocin and Rab5 253 ( early endosome marker ) ( Fig . 6a , b ) . Several podocytes were merged with Rab5 and 254 this result indicated that podocin was translocated to cytoplasm by the endocytosis 255 pathway . 256 257 Podocin was not translocated to the cytoplasm in minimal change disease 258 We evaluated the podocin gap in human minimal change disease ( MCD ) 259 biopsy specimens . Podocin and synpo merged clearly and no podocin gap could be 260 detected in MCD ( Fig . 7 ) . 261 Page 13 of 37 Cell and Tissue Research 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w [ Discussion ] 262 In this paper , we demonstrated that podocin was translocated from the SD 263 area to the cytoplasm area by the endocytosis pathway in PAN rats and in the 264 IgAN - poor prognosis group . We defined the podocin gap as follows : the difference in 265 the staining pattern between podocin and synpo , which are foot processes proteins . 266 Podocin is especially prevalent in the SD , but synpo is located beside actin bundles 267 in the foot processes ( 21 ) . As we demonstrated before , synpo is a critical protein for 268 podocytes and for organizing their structure ( 22 ) . In the absence of synpo , the 269 podocytes lose essential stress fibers and their cell bodies shrink so as to resemble 270 a fibroblast . On the other hand , SD proteins were naturally translocated from SD 271 to the cytoplasm , and keep its structure ( 23 ) . Within a diseased condition , the 272 endocytosis system of SD proteins may become damaged and the damage may 273 accelerate podocyte injury . Thus , we hypothesize that the difference of localization 274 between podocin and synpo may occur during podocyte injury . During proteinuria 275 conditions , the difference between the localization of podocin and synpo was 276 significantly more evident than during normal conditions . To focus on the podocin 277 gap , we checked the localization of podocin , and therefore we also demonstrated 278 that podocin was translocated to the cytoplasmic area with immune - electron 279 microscopy . Although podocin was traslocated to the cytoplasm , it does not 280 correlate to the level of proteinuria . Actually the podocin gap was not found in 281 either MCD , IgAN - r - good or IgAN - r - poor specimens . We estimated that the 282 translocation of podocin happened in severe podocyte injury . 283 Soda et al . reported that double knocked - out dynamin - 1 and - 2 mice , 284 synaptojanin knocked - out mice , and triple endophilin - 1 , - 2 , and - 3 knocked - out mice 285 showed significant proteinuria and foot process effacement ( 24 ) . They further 286 Page 14 of 37 Cell and Tissue Research 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w demonstrated that synaptojanin and endophilin , which are functional partners of 287 dynamin in synaptic vesicle endocytosis at neural synapses , were critically 288 implicated in the development of the permeability barrier of kidneys . This paper 289 indicated that the system of endocytosis in the podocytes is a critical phenomenon , 290 and that it is tightly connected to proteinuria and foot process effacement further 291 worsening the podocyte injury ( these knocked - out mice displayed a lethal kidney 292 failure ) . 293 Recent evidence suggests that endocytosis may play a vital role in the 294 internalization and recycling of nephrin ( 25 ) . Phosphorylation ( 26 ) and the 295 stimulation of high glucose ( 25 ) may initiate nephrin endocytosis and depends on 296 CIN / RukL , the homologue of CD2AP ( 27 ) . Focusing on endocytosis , Qin et al . 297 demonstrated that a raft - mediated endocytic pathway internalizes nephrin ( 28 ) , 298 and Godel et al . demonstrated that the trafficking of podocin is dependent on the 299 raft - mediated , non - conventional endocytic pathway ( 29 ) . This seems to be 300 consistent with the suggestion for endocytic trafficking of other prohibitin - domain 301 proteins ( 30 ) . Intriguingly , the podocin - related protein flotillin - 1 defines a clathrin - 302 independent endocytic pathway ( 31 ) , which could lead to the hypothesis that 303 podocin not only assembles members of the slit diaphragm but also orchestrates its 304 internalization via a self - defined pathway ( 29 ) . In this study , we demonstrated 305 that podocin merged with Rab5 in PAN rats at day 14 . At the same time the 306 podocin gap was significantly elevated , indicating that podocin was translocated to 307 the cytoplasm by the endocytosis pathway . Because Rab5 is a typical CME marker , 308 it shows evidence that podocin was interacts with the CME pathway . 309 The Wiggins group demonstrated that a single dose of PA caused 310 podocytes depletion that results in minor glomerular sclerosis ( 32 ) . As a podocyte 311 Page 15 of 37 Cell and Tissue Research 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w injury model we used PAN rats with a single peritoneal PA injection with the same 312 methods of Wiggis’ group . For our model of podocyte injury , we used PAN rats 313 prepared with a single peritoneal PA injection , just as Wiggis’ group used for their 314 experiment . PA induces oxidant injury in cells via the xanthine oxidase pathway , 315 and it was used as a similar model of MCD and focal segmental nephron sclerosis 316 in human ( 33 ) . We evaluated PAN rats samples , which showed podocytes 317 detachment and glomerular sclerosis . Clinically , MCD does not show such podocyte 318 change without foot process effacement ( FPE ) , so we used this model as a 319 podocytes injury model . We also tried to stain the podocin gap in human MCD , 320 however , there was no difference in the podocin and synpo staining ( Fig . 7 ) . 321 Recently , two papers demonstrated that FPE has been interpreted as a 322 protective response of podocytes in danger of detachment ( 34 , 35 ) . This FPE is 323 observed typically in MCD and in other glomerulonephritis . Similarly , PAN rats 324 and IgAN patients also show these pathological findings . The point is that the 325 podocin gap was observed only on PAN day 7 , 14 and IgAN - poor . These 326 pathological findings show severe glomerular damage and podocytes injury . 327 Compared to FPE , the podocin gap was only seen in severe conditions , we thought 328 it could be a predictive factor to assess the IgAN . 329 IgAN is the most common primary glomerulonephritis . An often insidious 330 progression to end - stage kidney disease in 25 – 40 % of cases is accompanied by the 331 development of glomerulosclerosis ( 36 ) . It is characterized by the mesangial 332 deposition of IgA , associated with mesangial cell proliferation and mesangial 333 matrix expansion . In addition to these common histologic abnormalities , other 334 glomerular abnormalities , such as segmental sclerosis , crescent formation , and 335 adhesion to the bowman capsules , are detected . Other indicators , such as the 336 Page 16 of 37 Cell and Tissue Research 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w number of podocytes per glomerulus might serve as a parameter of podocyte injury 337 and provide prognostic information for patients with IgAN ( 37 ) . Lemley et al . 338 reported that podocytopenia is associated with increasing disease severity in IgAN 339 ( 38 ) . The clinical course of IgAN is variable . The prevalence of clinically silent 340 IgAN may be surprising high ; in a Japanese study , 16 % of donor kidneys had 341 glomerular IgA deposits and nearly 2 % exhibited mesangioproliferative changes 342 with C3 deposits characteristic of IgAN ( 39 ) . Mesangial IgA is exclusively of the 343 IgA1 subclass and is deficient in galactose ( 40 ) . Besides these findings , the 344 proceeding mechanisms of IgAN are still obscure . Therefore , we focused on the 345 difference in pathological characterizations of IgAN . On this basis , we divided 346 IgAN samples into 4 categories , following the indicators of Japan Committee of 347 IgAN 2002 , and assessed each specimen . Only the poor prognosis specimens 348 showed a significant difference in the podocin gap , and this showed a translocation 349 of podocin to cytoplasm by endocytosis . Based on these results , we hypothesize that 350 podocin traffic may lead to severe podocyte injury or may happen in severely 351 injured podocytes . With these results , we postulate that podocin traffic may also 352 predict the prognosis of an IgAN disease course . 353 When evaluating IgAN , the patient ' s samples are very important for 354 estimating their prognosis , however at present we do not have a specific staining 355 reference . If endocytosis is more fully understood , the movement of some proteins 356 may be the key to knowing the turning point between reversible change and 357 irreversible change . 358 In the future , the role of podocin traffic may help shed light on the 359 mechanism of podocyte injury and indicate a medical approach to prevent the 360 advancement of the disease course . 361 Page 17 of 37 Cell and Tissue Research 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w [ Acknowledgement ] 362 AcknowledgmentsAcknowledgmentsAcknowledgmentsAcknowledgments 363 We thank Ms .
