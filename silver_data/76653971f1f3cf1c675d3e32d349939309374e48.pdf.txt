Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is the major uptake pathway in resting cells 1 , but several clathrin - independent endocytic routes exist in parallel 2 , 3 . One such pathway , fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) , is not constitutive but triggered upon activation of certain receptors , including the β 1 adrenergic receptor 4 . FEME activates promptly following stimulation as endophilin is pre - enriched by the phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 - bisphosphate - binding protein lamellipodin 4 , 5 . However , in the absence of stimulation , endophilin foci abort and dis - assemble after a few seconds . Looking for additional proteins involved in FEME , we found that 20 out of 65 BAR domain - containing proteins tested colocalized with endophilin spots . Among them , FBP17 and CIP4 prime the membrane of resting cells for FEME by recruiting the 5 ′ - lipid phosphatase SHIP2 and lamellipodin to mediate the local production of phosphati - dylinositol - 3 , 4 - bisphosphate and endophilin pre - enrichment . Membrane - bound GTP - loaded Cdc42 recruits FBP17 and CIP4 , before being locally deactivated by RICH1 and SH3BP1 GTPase - activating proteins . This generates the transient assembly and disassembly of endophilin spots , which lasts 5 – 10 seconds . This mechanism periodically primes patches of the membrane for prompt responses upon FEME activation . Fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) requires the stimulation of cargo receptors by their ligands to trigger the prompt budding of endocytic carriers from the plasma membrane 3 . FEME carriers are defined as cytoplasmic , clathrin - negative , endophilin - positive assemblies ( EPAs ) . The pre - recruitment of endophilin A ( subfamily comprising A1 , A2 and A3 in human ) into discrete foci on the plasma membrane before receptor activation may enable FEME to be very responsive to cargo activation 6 . If endophilin is not pre - enriched , FEME does not take place and cargo receptors either accumulate at the cell surface or enter cells through other alternative pathways 3 , 4 . Endophilin binds to the plasma mem - brane through its Bin1 / amphiphysin / Rvs161 / 167 ( BAR ) domain but is concentrated at endocytic sites by lamellipodin , which itself binds to locally produced phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ) 4 , 5 . In the absence of stimulation , the foci abort and disassemble after a few seconds and new ones form nearby ( Supplementary Video 1 ) . This is reminiscent to clathrin - coated pits that frequently abort if they are not stabilized by cargoes and fail to reach a critical size 7 . However , the spatially localized clus - tering of endophilin ( which is prominent at the leading edge ) and abortion ahead of FEME activation and endocytic carrier building suggest , instead , an active mechanism . To identify proteins that regulate FEME , we performed pull - down assays using recombinant SRC homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains of endophilin A1 to A3 and rat brain lysates and identified the binding partners by mass spectrometry ( Supplementary Fig . 1a and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Although known interactors , such as dynamin and synaptojanin were detected , several BAR domain - containing proteins were identified . This prompted us to test the binding of the endophilin A2 SH3 domain to all BAR proteins con - taining putative endophilin - binding proline - rich motifs 8 in their primary sequences . We found that endophilin bound to RhoGAP interacting with CIP4 homologues protein 1 ( RICH1 ; also called nadrin - 1 ) , SH3 domain - binding protein 1 ( SH3BP1 ) , Arf - GAP with coiled - coil , ANK repeat and PH domain - containing pro - tein 1 ( ACAP1 ) , Arf - GAP with SH3 domain , ANK repeat and PH domain - containing protein 1 ( ASAP1 ) and SLIT - ROBO Rho GTPase - activating protein 1 ( srGAP1 ) , srGAP2 and srGAP3 but not to the other BAR proteins tested ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . The lack of binding of endophilin A2 SH3 domain to protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons proteins 1 – 3 ( PACSIN1 – 3 ; also called syndapin 1 – 3 ) in HEK293 cell extracts suggests poten - tial differences in tissue - specific complexes or post - translational modifications ( in particular phosphorylation ) between brain and non - neuronal tissues . Together with the previously known binding of endophilin to oligophrenin - 1 ( OPHN1 ) 9 and bridging integrator 2 ( Bin2 ) 10 , this suggested that several BAR domain proteins in addi - tion to endophilin could be involved in FEME . A role for several of them during the invagination of EPAs in the absence of a dense pro - tein coat would be coherent with their capacity to sense and induce membrane curvature and functions in local actin nucleation 11 – 13 . To test this , we cloned 65 BAR proteins known in human ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) and tested for their colocalization with endogenous endophilin foci at the leading edge of resting cells , FBP17 and CIP4 recruit SHIP2 and lamellipodin to prime the plasma membrane for fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis Laura Chan Wah Hak 1 , 5 , Shaheen Khan 1 , Ilaria Di Meglio 1 , 6 , Ah - Lai Law 2 , Safa Lucken - Ardjomande Häsler 3 , Leonor M .

We used BSC1 cells , as all but three of the BAR proteins tested ( FAM92B , PACSIN1 and proline - serine - threonine phosphatase - interacting protein 1 ( PSTPIP1 ) ) are expressed in the kidney , their tissue of origin ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Each enhanced green fluorescent protein ( eGFP ) - tagged construct was titrated down to achieve low expression , and colo - calization with endogenous endophilin staining was measured on confocal microscope images using line scans ( Supplementary Figs . 3 and 4a – c ) . To minimize artefactual colocalization , we used the membrane - bound probe CAAX - eGFP as a negative control and applied the stringent criterion that both endophilin and the BAR protein candidate must be enriched on discrete puncta over their surrounding signals ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . Thus , any endophilin foci being located within diffuse BAR protein signals that extend beyond a punctum ( such as Arfaptin 1 - 2 , protein interacting with C kinase 1 ( Pick1 ) , RICH2 or GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase ( GRAF1 ) ) were scored negative . Overall , out of the 65 BAR proteins tested , 20 colocalized with high significance ( P < 0 . 01 ) with endophilin ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Figs . 3 and 4a – c ) . Interestingly , only amphiphysin , Bin1 , Bin2 , Islet cell auto - antigen 1 - like protein ( ICA1 - L ) , RICH1 , SH3BP1 , OPHN1 , ASAP1 and PSTPIP1 were detected on more than 50 % of the foci . Formin - binding protein 17 ( FBP17 ) , Cdc42 - interacting protein 4 ( CIP4 ) , sorting nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) , nostrin , PACSIN1 to PACSIN3 and srGAP1 to srGAP3 were detected on a subset of puncta , suggesting that they either marked a subgroup of endophilin spots or a different timing of recruitment . It is important to note that , among the BAR pro - teins identified , only Bin1 , RICH1 , SH3BP1 , ASAP1 , FBP17 , CIP4 , PACSIN2 , srGAP1 and srGAP2 are expressed in most human tis - sues ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) , suggesting a potential tissue - specific role for the other candidates . Conscious of the possible artefacts induced by expressing eGFP - tagged transgenes , albeit at the low - est possible levels , we validated the colocalization of the candidates for which commercial antibodies were available . We confirmed that endogenous Bin1 , CIP4 , RICH1 , ASAP1 , SNX9 , PACSIN2 and srGAP1 colocalized to various extent with endogenous endophilin in BSC1 cells and also in human normal diploid retinal pigmented epithelial ( hTERT - RPE1 ) cells ( Fig . 1b ) . Activation of several receptors including the β 1 adrenergic recep - tor ( β 1 - AR ) triggers FEME 4 . Stimulation of cells with β 1 - AR agonists induces the prompt ( < 10 s ) formation of FEME carriers that con - tained endogenous β 1 - AR but not clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) cargoes , such as transferrin ( Fig . 1c , d and Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . Following longer incubation times ( > 30 min ) , endogenous β 1 - AR internalized and accumulated into lysosome - associated membrane glycoprotein 1 ( LAMP1 ) - positive endosomes in an endophilin - dependent but AP2 - independent manner ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . 4f ) , confirming that FEME and not CME was the main endocytic pathway for β 1 - AR 4 , 14 . Even though Bin1 and amphiphysin colocalized on most endophilin spots at the leading edge , their double knockdown ( DKD ) did not affect β 1 - AR uptake , suggesting that they were either redundant or not involved in the internalization of this particular cargo . By contrast , despite their colocalization on less than 50 % of the endophilin foci , FBP17 and CIP4 were required for the uptake of β 1 - AR ( Fig . 1c , d and Supplementary Fig . 4e ) . FBP17 , CIP4 and transducer of Cdc42 - dependent actin assembly protein 1 ( TOCA - 1 ) form a subgroup of the F - BAR protein family , having a similar domain organization comprising F - BAR , HR1 ( also called Ras exchange motif ( REM ) ) and SH3 domains . We found that , as for several other BAR protein subfamilies , FBP17 , CIP4 and TOCA - 1 can heterodimerize through their BAR domains ( Supplementary Fig . 1c , d ) , suggesting redun - dancy or cooperation in their functions . FBP17 and CIP4 are involved in CME and are recruited at late stages of clathrin - coated pit formation 15 – 17 , as well as into oscillating waves on the plasma membrane 18 , 19 . Their role in β 1 - AR uptake and their clustering into spots on the leading edge of resting cells ( Figs . 1b and 2a ) suggested an additional role in FEME . FBP17 and CIP4 did not bind to β 1 - AR and were not recruited on budded FEME carriers ( Figs . 1e and 2b ) . The inhibition of β 1 - AR uptake in FBP17 and CIP4 - depleted cells ( F + C DKD ) was consis - tent with the strong reduction ( 89 . 3 ± 4 . 7 % ) of FEME carrier forma - tion upon receptor activation ( Fig . 2c ) . By contrast , overexpression of FBP17 or CIP4 , but not of TOCA - 1 , increased the formation of EPAs by over twofold upon stimulation ( Fig . 2d ) . These were pro - ductive FEME carriers , as measured by receptor interaction with endophilin ( using the proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) ) and β 1 - AR uptake ( Fig . 2e , f ) . The stimulatory effect was phosphatidylinosi - tol - 3 - OH kinase ( PI3K ) and endophilin dependent ( Fig . 2e , f and Supplementary Video 3 ) , consistent with the FEME mechanism . The recruitment of endophilin was strongly reduced ( 86 . 3 ± 5 . 2 % ) in F + C DKD cells and was significantly increased in FBP17 or CIP4 - overexpressing cells ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Consistent with their nucleating activity , they were recruited 8 ± 4 s before the flashes of endophilin ( Fig . 2g , h and Supplementary Videos 4 and 5 ) . This explains their low degree of colocalization in fixed samples ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Upon receptor activation , the frequency of spot nucleation increased by over twofold , but the duration of CIP4 or endophilin and their order of arrival did not change ( Fig . 2h ) . By contrast , β 1 - AR was only recruited to endophilin spots upon activation . CIP4 overexpression boosted the frequency of spot nucleation and prolonged the spot duration ( Fig . 2h ) , which explains the increase in FEME observed in this condition ( Fig . 2d – f ) . Thus , we concluded that FBP17 and CIP4 were upstream of endophilin and were required to recruit it in tran - sient puncta and to prime the membrane of resting cells for FEME . FBP17 and CIP4 were recently found to bind to SH2 domain - containing inositol 5 ′ - phosphatase 1 ( SHIP1 ) and SHIP2 in mast cells and to precede them by ~ 5 s on the membrane 19 . In fibroblasts , SHIP2 is known to be recruited to the leading edge and to hydro - lyse PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 into PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 within seconds 20 . We con - firmed that FBP17 and CIP4 bound to the ubiquitously expressed SHIP2 and found that they colocalized with it at the leading edge in BSC1 cells ( Fig . 3a , b ) . CIP4 was still recruited to the leading edge in the absence of SHIP1 and SHIP2 but not the other way around . Double depletion of SHIP1 and SHIP2 was performed because of the expression of SHIP1 in the kidney ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) , which could compensate SHIP2 depletion . FBP17 and CIP4 also bound to lamellipodin and recruited it to the leading edge ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Systematic depletion and overexpression of the various play - ers revealed that FBP17 and CIP4 recruit SHIP2 and lamellipo - din , which then enrich endophilin at the leading edge of resting cells ( Fig . 3d – f ) . We found that SHIP2 was functionally upstream of lamellipodin , suggesting that local PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 production was required in addition of FBP17 and CIP4 binding to stabilize lamellipodin . Inhibiting SHIP2 not only strongly reduced the fre - quency and duration of the priming spots in resting cells but it also blocked the recruitment of β 1 - AR by endophilin into FEME carriers ( Fig . 3g – j and Supplementary Video 6 ) . FBP17 , CIP4 and TOCA - 1 are Cdc42 effectors that bind to the active ( GTP - loaded ) form through their REMs 21 , 22 . Inhibiting Cdc42 using ML141 or secramine or by overexpressing a domi - nant - negative form was sufficient to strongly reduce endogenous CIP4 recruitment to the leading edges , even in cells depleted of endophilin ( Fig . 4a – e ) . Inhibiting Cdc42 also hindered the recruit - ment of SHIP2 , lamellipodin and endophilin to the leading edge , placing active Cdc42 upstream of them all . CIP4 recruitment to the leading edge was narrowed down to its REM domain ( Fig . 4f – h ) , as only truncated constructs containing this motif were recruited to the leading edge in FBP17 + CIP4 + TOCA - 1 TKD cells ( to avoid the recruitment of the transgenes by heterodimerization through the BAR domain of endogenous proteins ) . Inhibiting Cdc42 prevented NATurE CELL BIoLogy | VOL 20 | SEPTEMBER 2018 | 1023 – 1031 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 1024 Letters Nature Cell Biology C AAX e G F P A r f ap t i n1 A r f ap t i n2 F A M 92 B I C A 69 I C A 1 - L P I C K 1 T uba T uba - li k e A m ph B i n1 B i n2 B i n3 E ndo A 1 E ndo A 2 E ndo A 3 E ndo B 1 E ndo B 2 R I CH 1 R I CH 2 S H 3 BP 1 O P HN 1 G R A F 1 G R A F 2 APP L1 APP L2 A C AP 1 A C AP 2 A C AP 3 ASAP 1 ASAP 2 ASAP 3 S N X 1 S N X 2 S N X 4 S N X 5 S N X 6 S N X 7 S N X 8 S N X 9 S N X 18 S N X 30 S N X 32 S N X 33 F BP 17 C I P 4 T O C A - 1 PA C S I N 1 PA C S I N 2 PA C S I N 3 PS T P I P 1 PS T P I P 2 N o s t r i n G AS 7 F CH S D 1 F CH S D 2 F CH o1 F CH o2 F E R F ES s r G AP 1 s r G AP 2 s r G AP 3 H M H A 1 I R S p53 I R T KS P i n k ba r M I M ABBA - 1 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 S po t s po s i t i v e f o r BA R p r o t e i n s ( % ) N S BAR N - BAR F - BAR BAR - PH BAR - PX I - BAR P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P = 0 . 0006 P = 0 . 0036 P = 0 . 0051 P = 0 . 1529 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S 55 35 35 35 55 C on t r o l A P 2 E ndo T K D B i n1 A m ph + B i n1 F B P 17 C I P 4 T O C A - 1 F + C D K D F + C + T T K D 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 NS N S 4 min ( in EPAs ) 30 min ( in LAMP1 + ) P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P = 0 . 002 P = 0 . 051 NS N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S N S 1 S 11 β 1 - A R up t a k e ( % o f c on t r o l ) RNAi NS 01 00 .

FBP17 and CIP4 cluster the 5 ′ - phosphatases SHIP1 and SHIP2 as well as lamellipodin through their SH3 domains ( step 2 ) . Lamellipodin is further stabilized by PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , which is locally produced by SHIP1 / 2 . Endophilin is recruited and concentrated by lamellipodin ( step 3 ) . From there , pre - enriched endophilin mediates prompt FEME carrier formation upon cargo activation . In the absence of cargo activation , the FEME priming complex disassembles ( step 4 ) upon local Cdc42 deactivation by the GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) RICH1 and SH3BP1 .

Thus , active Cdc42 recruits FBP17 and CIP4 to prime cells for FEME . Intriguingly , acute inhibition ( 2 min ) of Cdc42 induced the paradoxical hyperactivation of FEME in the first few minutes 4 , but longer incubation ( > 10 min ) inhibits it ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . This suggested that cycles of activation and inhibition of Cdc42 were required for the transient and periodic recruitment of FBP17 and CIP4 in foci . Among the BAR proteins that bind to endophilin and colocalize with it at the leading edges are RICH1 , SH3BP1 and OPHN1 ( Fig . 1a , b and Supplementary Figs . 1 – 3 ) , which are GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) for Cdc42 23 – 25 . Overexpression of RICH1 , SH3BP1 or OPHN1 , but not that of their GAP - mutated forms , inhibited endophilin recruitment in resting cells , whereas the depletion of RICH1 and SH3BP1 ( R + S DKD ) enhanced the phenotype ( Fig . 5a – c and Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . However , CIP4 and lamellipodin were still recruited to the leading edge of resting R + S DKD cells . RICH1 required FBP17 and CIP4 but not lamel - lipodin or endophilin for its recruitment to the leading edge ( Fig . 5b and Supplementary Fig . 5c , d ) . This is consistent with the binding of RICH1 , SH3BP1 and OPHN1 to FBP17 ( Supplementary Fig . 5e ) and CIP4 ( ref . 24 ) . Akin to CIP4 overexpression , the upregulation of endophilin foci by R + S DKD primed cells to produce more FEME carriers containing β 1 - AR upon stimulation ( Fig . 5d – g ) . Together , this implies a model in which a negative - feedback loop consisting of local Cdc42 inactivation by GAPs terminates the local clustering of FBP17 or CIP4 , SHIP2 , lamellipodin and endophilin ( Fig . 5h ) . This creates short - lived membrane patches that are primed to bud FEME carriers that abort in the absence of receptor activation . The finding that discrete patches of the plasma membrane are primed for FEME but rapidly abort and disassemble in the absence of receptor stimulation explains the promptness to form endocytic carriers upon activation . When a receptor is activated , it is recruited to pre - existing endophilin patches that rapidly become FEME carri - ers . Thus , FEME shares some similarities with CME in the genera - tion of unproductive and abortive events in the absence of receptor activation or stabilization 7 . However , the pre - enrichment mecha - nism reported here differs from endophilin recruitment at the latest stages ( just before scission ) of clathrin - coated pits or interleukin - 2 receptor - β ( IL - 2R - β ) - containing vesicles 26 . It may be that more copies of endophilin are required during FEME than the 10 – 20 molecules that recruit dynamin at the neck of forming CME or clath - rin - independent endocytosis carriers 26 , 27 . The finding that active Cdc42 is required for FEME priming raises the question of poten - tial similarities in the mechanism to that of other Cdc42 - dependent clathrin - independent endocytosis , such as the GRAF1 - mediated clathrin - independent carrier ( CLIC ) pathway , which is also promi - nent at the leading edges 28 – 30 and relies on the BAR proteins IRSp53 and PICK1 ( ref . 31 ) . Even though Cdc42 is involved in both pro - cesses , it acts later during the CLIC pathway , localizing onto surface - detached carriers and mediating their intracellular maturation 32 , instead of operating upstream during endocytic protein recruitment . The early arrival of F - BAR proteins to endocytic sites of shal - low curvatures has been reported during CME where F - BAR domain - only protein 1 ( FCHo1 ) and FCHo2 prime the pathway 33 . Mechanistically , the preceding of F - BAR proteins ( FBP17 and CIP4 ) from N - BAR proteins ( endophilin , RICH1 and SH3BP1 ) is consis - tent with their preference for different membrane curvatures and membrane tensions 27 , 34 and possibly aids their temporal segregation . The presence of multiple N - BAR proteins will probably expand the cargo possibilities of the pathway . Strikingly , CIP4 , lamellipodin , SHIP2 , SH3BP1 and endophilin are all overexpressed in various can - cers 35 – 39 , suggesting a potential role for FEME in tumour formation . Finally , the potential colocalization of endophilin with several BAR proteins other than the ones followed up in this study ( Fig . 1a ) opens the possibility that endophilin could be recruited by different mechanisms , perhaps in a cell - type - specific or cargo - specific man - ner to prime cells for FEME . For example , the binding of srGAP3 to lamellipodin 40 suggests an alternative option to endophilin recruit - ment to Robo axon guidance receptors or other srGAP - dependent receptors . Other BAR proteins probably perform additional roles other than recruiting endophilin during FEME .

After the incubation periods at 37 °C , cells stimulated as described above were quickly washed once with 37 °C pre - warmed PBS to removed unbound ligands and fixed with pre - warmed 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 37 °C . Fixed cells were then washed three times with PBS and once with PBS supplemented with 50 mM NH 4 Cl to quench free paraformaldehyde . Cells were then permeabilized ( 0 . 05 % saponin ) , immunostained and imaged as described below . Antibodies . The following antibodies were used for immunostaining or immunoblotting : anti - endophilin A2 clones H - 60 and A - 11 ( rabbit polyclonal sc - 25495 and mouse monoclonal sc - 365704 , respectively , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti - β 1 - AR ( rabbit polyclonal , ab3442 , AbCam , for immunostaining or PA1 - 049 , Thermo Scientific , for western blotting ) , anti - lamellipodin ( mouse monoclonal clone H - 5 , sc - 390050 , Santa Cruz , and rabbit polyclonal , HPA020027 , Atlas Antibodies ) , anti - CIP4 ( mouse monoclonal clone 21 , sc - 135868 , Santa Cruz ) , anti - Bin1 ( rabbit polyclonal , GTX103259 , GeneTex ) , anti - RICH1 ( rabbit polyclonal , A304 - 689A , Bethyl Labs ) , anti - SNX9 ( mouse monoclonal clone 2F1 , ab118996 , AbCam ) , anti - PACSIN2 ( rabbit polyclonal , AP8088b , Abgent ) , anti - srGAP1 ( mouse monoclonal clone 5D2 , H00057522 - M03 , Abnova ) , anti - ASAP1 ( mouse monoclonal clone P7Q , sc - 81896 , Santa Cruz ) , anti - SHIP2 ( mouse monoclonal clone 3E6 , H00003636 - M01 , Novus Biological , or rabbit monoclonal clone C76A7 , 2839 , Cell Signaling Technologies ) , anti - α - adaptin clone 8 ( mouse monoclonal , 610501 , BD Bioscience ) , anti - GAPDH clone 14C10 ( rabbit polyclonal , 2118 , Cell Signaling Technologies ) , anti - LAMP1 ( mouse monoclonal clone H4A3 - c , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank or rabbit polyclonal D2D11 , 9091 , Cell Signaling Technologies ) , anti - eGFP ( rabbit polyclonal , ab290 , AbCam , or mouse monoclonal clones 7 . 1 and 13 . 1 , 11814460001 , Roche ) , anti - Myc tag clone 71D10 ( rabbit monoclonal , 2278 , Cell Signaling Technologies ) . Primary antibodies were used at 0 . 1 – 1 μ g ml − 1 for immunoblotting and 0 . 1 – 2 μ g ml − 1 for immunofluorescence . The following secondary antibodies were used : Alexa Fluor - 488 ( A - 11001 ) and Alexa Fluor - 555 ( A - 21422 ) goat anti - mouse IgG , Alexa Fluor - 488 ( A - 11008 ) and Alexa Fluor - 555 ( A - 21428 ) goat anti - rabbit IgG ( all from Thermo Scientific ) , and goat anti - mouse IgG - HRP conjugate ( 1706516 ) and goat anti - rabbit IgG - HRP conjugate ( 1706516 ) from Bio - Rad . See Supplementary Table 4 for full antibody details . Immunostaining , PLAs , laser scanning confocal fluorescent microscopy and analysis . Fixed samples were permeabilized ( 0 . 05 % saponin ) and immunostained ( primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 5 % BSA ) . In some experiments , phalloidin - Alexa Fluor - 647 ( 8940 , Cell Signaling Technologies ) was added with secondary antibodies . PLAs were performed using Duolink PLA technology ( kit DUO92101 , Sigma ) , following instructions given by the manufacturer . The coverslips were mounted with DABCO anti - fade agent on glass slides and imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope ( TCS Sp5 AOBS , Leica ) equipped with a × 63 objective . For Alexa Fluor - 488 , the illumination was at 488 nm and emission was collected between 498 and 548 nm ; for Alexa Fluor - 555 , the laser illumination was at 543 nm and emission was collected between 555 and 620 nm ; for Alexa Fluor - 647 and DRAQ5 , the laser illumination was at 633 nm and emission was collected between 660 and 746 nm . The percentages of colocalization of BAR proteins with endophilin spots located at the leading edge of cells were determined using Volocity 6 . 0 . The levels of CIP4 eGFP - tagged constructs at the leading edges of cells were measured on masks covering a total of at least 100 - μ m long ( ~ 2 - μ m wide ) of the leading edge of at least three cells from three independent experiments using Volocity 6 . 0 . Live - cell confocal fluorescent microscopy . Just before live - cell imaging , the medium of cells grown on MatTek dishes was changed to α - MEM without phenol red , supplemented with 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , and 5 % FBS and placed into a temperature - controlled chamber on the microscope stage with 95 % air : 5 % CO 2 and 100 % humidity . Live - cell imaging data were acquired using a fully motorized inverted microscope ( Eclipse TE - 2000 , Nikon ) equipped with a CSU - X1 spinning disk confocal head ( UltraVIEW VoX , Perkin - Elmer ) using a × 60 lens ( Plan Apochromat VC , 1 . 4 NA , Nikon ) under the control of Volocity 6 . 0 ( Improvision ) . Digital images ( 14 bit ) were obtained with a cooled EMCCD camera ( 9100 - 02 , Hamamatsu ) . Four 50 - mW solid - state lasers ( 405 , 488 , 561 and 647 nm ; Crystal Laser and Melles Griots ) coupled to individual acousto - optic tuneable filters were used as the light source to excite eGFP , Alexa Fluor - 488 , TagRFP - T , Alexa Fluor - 555 and Alexa Fluor - 647 , as appropriate . Rapid two - colour time lapses were acquired at 500 - ms to 2 - s intervals , using a dual ( 525 / 50 ; 640 / 120 , Chroma ) emission filter , respectively . The power of the lasers supported excitation times of 50 ms in each wavelength and the acousto - optic tuneable filters allowed minimum delay ( ~ 1 ms ) between two colours ( for example , the delay between green and red for each timepoint ) , which was an important factor to assess the colocalization between markers . Plasma membrane isolation . Cell surface protein isolation , excluding intracellular proteins , was performed as in ref . 4 , by selective biotinylation using a cell - impermeable cleavable biotinylation reagent ( sulfo - NHS - SS - biotin ) , followed by the purification of surface proteins by affinity - purified NeutrAvidin agarose resin ( 89881 , Thermo Scientific ) . Statistics and reproducibility . The samples sizes and statistical tests were selected based on previous studies with similar methodologies . Sample sizes were not determined using statistical methods . All experiments were independently repeated at least three times , giving similar results . For all figures , results shown are the mean ± standard error of the mean ( s . e . m . ) . Statistical testing was performed using Prism 6 ( GraphPad Software ) . Comparisons of data in Figs . 1a , 2e , f and 3j ( middle and right panels ) , 4g , 5c and 5g ( middle ) were performed by one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with Tukey’s multiple comparison test . Comparisons of all other data were performed by two - way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test . P < 0 . 01 was considered significant . Reporting Summary .
