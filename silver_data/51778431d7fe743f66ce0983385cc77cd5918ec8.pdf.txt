Although the neural underpinnings of creativity have been studied over decades , very little is known about neural mechanisms of the cre - ative process that relates to numerical problem solving . In the present study , we employed a numerical analogical reasoning task with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) to investigate the neural correlates of divergent production of rules in numerical analogical reasoning . Participants performed two tasks : a multiple solution analogical reasoning task and a single solution analogical reasoning task . Results revealed that divergent production of rules involves signiﬁcant activations at Brodmann area ( BA ) 10 in the right middle frontal cortex , BA 40 in the left inferior parietal lobule , and BA 8 in the superior frontal cortex . The results suggest that right BA 10 and left BA 40 are involved in the generation of novel rules , and BA 8 is associated with the inhibition of initial rules in numerical analogical reasoning .

Introduction Creativity plays an important role in every day work and life . For instance , 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . . . . + 100 = ? Regular solving strate - gies involve adding gradually the numbers from the beginning through the end . Alternately , a creative strategy might involve cal - culating 1 + 100 = 101 , 2 + 99 = 101 , 3 + 98 = 101 , . . . . . . , 49 + 52 = 101 , 50 + 51 = 101 . . . . . . The total number of pairs is 50 , so the answer would be 50 × 101 = 5050 . In recent years , there has been increasing interest in the nature and neurocognitive mechanisms of creativ - ity ( Arden , Chavez , Grazioplene , & Jung , 2010 ; Dietrich & Kanso , 2010 ) . Neuroimaging studies have found that creative problem solving involves prefrontal ( e . g . , Fink et al . , 2009 ; Green , Kraemer , Fugelsang , Gray , & Dunbar , 2012 ; Zhang , Liu , & Zhang , 2014 ) , pari - etal ( Fink et al . , 2009 ; Siebörger , Ferstl , & von Cramon , 2007 ) , temporal ( Chávez - Eakle , Graff - Guerrero , García - Reyna , Vaugier , & Cruz - Fuentes , 2007 ; Fink et al . , 2009 ) , and visual brain regions ( e . g . , Howard - Jones , Blakemore , Samuel , Summers , & Claxton , 2005 ) . The vast majority of these studies employ verbal tasks , rather than numerical stimuli . In contrast to verbal processing , number pro - cessing involves different mental representations ( Dehaene , 2005 ) ∗ Corresponding author . E - mail address : qrzhang @ swu . edu . cn ( H . Zhang ) . and different neural mechanisms ( Jia et al . , 2011 ; Cohen - Kadosh et al . , 2005 ; Piazza , Mechelli , Butterworth , & Price , 2002 ; Richland , Zur , & Holyoak , 2007 ; Zhong et al . , 2011 ) . Some researches have uncovered the difference and similarities in the ability of number representation ( Brannon , 2002 ; Condry & Spelke , 2008 ) between the humans and non human animals , adults and infants / pre - school children in numerical magnitude ( Brannon , 2006 ) , approximate system ( DeWind , Adams , Platt , & Brannon , 2015 ) , abstractness ( Condry & Spelke , 2008 ) , judgement ( Brannon , 2002 ) , reason ( Feigenson , Dehaene , & Spelke , 2004 ) , and analogy ( Cantlon , Safford , & Brannon , 2010 ; Lewis , Jaffe , & Brannon , 2005 ) . Those studies have provided new insights into cognitive development of numerical problem solving . Recently , several imaging studies have suggested that parietal cortex is associated with the men - tal manipulation of numerical quantities ( Dehaene , Piazza , Pinel , & Cohen , 2003 ) , posterior parietal cortex is responsible for spatial and integrative properties in numerical cognition ( Roitman , Brannon , & Platt , 2012 ) , and inferior frontal cortex is recruited for abstract processing of numbers in children ( Cantlon et al . , 2009 ) . While numerical , calculation , and math abilities have been well localized to the parietal lobes , only one study , to date , has compared brain regional differences between a cohort of academic mathemati - cians and matched academic controls ( Aydin et al . , 2007 ) . These researchers found increased gray matter density in bilateral inferior parietal lobes and left inferior frontal gyrus of the mathematicians , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . biopsycho . 2016 . 03 . 011 0301 - 0511 / © 2016 Elsevier B . V . All rights reserved . X . Wu et al . / Biological Psychology 117 ( 2016 ) 170 – 178 171 as well as a signiﬁcant correlation ( r = 0 . 84 ) between years in aca - demic service and right parietal gray matter density . However the relationship between mathematical reasoning and creative prob - lem solving remains unknown , particularly within normal human subjects not expert in mathematics . Outstanding questions include : what regions of the brain are associated with numerical creativ - ity , and what are the neural underpinnings of numerical creative problem solving ? The purpose of the present study was to eluci - date brain regions responsible for divergent processing of rules in numerical analogical reasoning . Analogical reasoning has been linked to creativity ( Green et al . , 2012 ) . This association is hypothesized to relate to the ﬁnding that a mental leap between two analogues often leads to sud - den insight into problem solving ( Holyoak & Thagard , 1997 ) . Prior studies have suggested that analogical reasoning recruits rostro - lateral prefrontal cortex for relational integration ( Luo et al . , 2003 ; Watson & Chatterjee , 2012 ) and mapping and inference processes ( Krawczyk , McClelland , Donovan , Tillman , & Maguire , 2010 ) , and frontopolar cortex for distant semantic associations ( Green et al . , 2012 ) . A recent fMRI study further examined ﬂuid intelligence of analogical reasoning using number strings , letter strings and poly - gon strings ( Geake & Hansen , 2010 ) . In this study , participants were asked to make a “yes” or “no” response to the truthfulness of analogical reasoning statements ( i . e . , 123 → 124 , 876 → 976 ) . Their results showed that analogical reasoning involving number , let - ter , and polygon strings all involved signiﬁcant activation in the prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex when ﬂuid analogical reason - ing was compared with non - ﬂuid analogical reasoning . However , participants in Geake and Hansen’s study were only required to make identiﬁcation for a given number / answer among plausible answers , rather than generate different numbers / answers by par - ticipant themselves . More importantly , the purpose of their study was not directly related to neural mechanisms of the creative pro - cess in numerical processing . Creativity refers to the generation of ideas that are both novel and useful ( e . g . , Mayer , 1999 ) . Divergent thinking has been consid - ered to be a core component of creativity ( Guilford , 1967 ; Torrance , 1974 ) . A classic divergent thinking paradigm of numerical analog - ical reasoning ( Hofstadter , 1995 ) involves participants generating several answers / solutions to a numerical problem based on differ - ent analogical reasoning rules . It is apparent that multiple solution analogical reasoning tasks mainly involve divergent thinking of numerical rules . In contrast , single solution analogical reasoning tasks involve non - divergent processing of numerical rules . Thus , multiple solution analogical reasoning and single solution ana - logical reasoning might be represented in different brain regions . The neural activity pattern from direct contrast between the two types of tasks might be a measure for crucial components of neu - ral circuits underlying divergent production of rules in numerical analogical reasoning . Based on previous ﬁndings , including : 1 ) pre - frontal cortex involvement in both distant associations in verbal analogical reasoning and the identiﬁcation of numerical abstract relations ( Geake & Hansen , 2010 ; Green et al . , 2012 ; Howard - Jones et al . , 2005 ) , and 2 ) frontopolar cortex involvement with remote semantic relatedness of verbal processing in divergent thinking , we hypothesized that the prefrontal cortex would be crucial to neu - ral circuits underlying divergent production of rules in numerical analogical reasoning . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Participants Twenty college students ( 11 female and 9 male ; mean age : 22 years ; age range : 19 – 25 years ) were included in the study and paid for their participation . All participants were right - handed ( deter - mined by the Handedness Test before the experiment ) , and had no history of neurological or psychiatric illness . The study was approved by Human Participants Review Committee of the Uni - versity Brain Imaging Center . All participants signed the informed written consent before participating in the study . 2 . 2 . Design and materials In order to examine the neural basis of divergent production of rules , we utilized a classic divergent thinking paradigm with numerical analogical reasoning ( Hofstadter , 1995 ) . In Hofstadter’s paradigm there are several answers / solutions to a numerical diver - gent problem based on different analogical reasoning rules . In the present study , numerical analogical reasoning tasks were divided into two conditions : single solution tasks and multiple solution tasks . For example , when a stimulus trial of the single solution ana - logical reasoning task was presented ( Fig . 1A ) , there was only one correct answer “8” . In contrast , when a stimulus trial of the mul - tiple solution analogical reasoning task was presented ( Fig . 1B ) , there were three possible correct answers “4” , “3” and “2” . Each of the answers / solutions corresponds to a speciﬁc rule . The rule corresponded to a relation between digits in an analogy pair of a numerical analogical reasoning task . In the ﬁrst example , the answer “8” is arrived at according to the rule regarding the visual location between digits : next to the center most digit - pair . In the second example , the answer “4” is arrived at according to the rule regarding the visual location relation between digits : also next to the centermost digit - pair . However , the answer “3” or “2” is arrived at according to the rule regarding the abstract quantity rela - tion between digits : just greater than the smallest digit - pair or the smallest even number . Three different conditions were used to investigate the neural bases of numerical divergent thinking in analogical reasoning : the single solution analogical reasoning task , the multiple solution ana - logical reasoning task , and a recognition task . The format of the analogical reasoning tasks in our study was “ AB : : C ? ” , and a prompt indicated the type of a task to be solved above each stimulus trial . There was only one answer in the single solution analogical reason - ing task . For example , in the stimulus trial of analogical reasoning task ( Fig . 1A ) , “8” was the only correct answer . In contrast , there were two , or more than two , answers in the multiple solution ana - logical reasoning task . For example , “4” , “3” and “2” were possible correct answers of the numerical analogical reasoning task ( Fig . 1B ) . Each answer of the analogical reasoning tasks corresponded to a speciﬁc rule . To prevent participants from using repeatedly the same rules to solve all the tasks , we designed experimental tasks so that participants had to use a large number of different abstract quantity rules to complete the multiple solution analogical reason - ing task , apart from visual location relations appearing once in each of the multiple solution analogical reasoning tasks . Similarly , visual location relations appeared in each of the single solution analogical reasoning tasks . Recognition tasks , as baseline , had a similar format to the analogical reasoning tasks . The difference here was that par - ticipants were requested to identify whether the ﬁrst three items ( A , B , C ) had the same digit or not . For example , a baseline stimu - lus ( Fig . 1C ) asked participants to respond “yes” , as the ﬁrst three items included the same digit “4” . 120 stimulus trials were used in our experiment . Each condition included 40 trials . In the scanning sessions , each stimulus trial was presented in random order in an event - related design . Each stimulus trial lasted ten seconds , and there was a 200 ms ﬁxation cross presented before each stimulus . Before scanning , participants practiced the tasks in order to familiarize themselves with the experimental protocol . Partic - ipants would not proceed to formal experiment unless they successfully completed three consecutive trials performing the 172 X . Wu et al . / Biological Psychology 117 ( 2016 ) 170 – 178 Fig . 1 . Examples of experimental materials ( A ) Stimuli were used in the single solution analogical reasoning task . ( B ) Stimuli were used in the multiple solution analogical reasoning task . ( C ) Stimuli were used in recognition task as baseline . correct rules under each condition in the practice tasks . In the scan - ning session , participants held a keypad with two buttons in each hand . They were instructed to press the left button on the key - pad with their left hand as soon as possible when they had the answer / solution to the analogical reasoning tasks . In contrast to the single solution analogical reasoning task , the multiple solution analogical reasoning task required participants to press the left but - ton with their left hand when they had two answers / solutions . For recognition tasks , participants were required to press the left but - ton with their left hand when they identiﬁed the same number in the ﬁrst three items or press the right button on the keypad with their right hand when there was not a number match in the ﬁrst three items . After scanning , participants completed a questionnaire with paper and pen in order to examine answers / solutions generated in their mind while in the scanning session . The questions were the same stimulus trials as presentation during scanning . Partici - pants were required to recall their answers generated during the scanning . 2 . 3 . MRI acquisition Scanning was performed on a 3 . 0 T Siemens Trio system equipped with a standard birdcage head coil . Participants were placed in the scanner in a supine position with their right index ﬁnger positioned on the response buttons on a keypad . Earplugs were used to dampen scanner noise . Visual stimuli were presented through a projector onto a screen in the bore of the scanner . Par - ticipants viewed the stimuli through a mirror mounted to the head coil . Structural images were acquired using a standard 3D T1 - weighted sequence for each participant to provide anatomical reference ( 1 × 1 × 1 mm 3 ) . Functional images were collected using a gradient - echo planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence . In each volume , we used an interleaved slice mode to cover the whole brain , 32 slices were acquired axially and each slice thickness was 0 . 9 mm . Each volume was acquired with a repetition time ( TR ) of 2000 ms and echo time ( TE ) of 30 ms , ﬁeld of view ( FOV ) of 220 × 220 mm , a ﬂip angle of 90 ◦ , matrix size of 64 × 64 , and the spatial resolution of 3 . 4 × 3 . 4 × 4 mm 3 . 2 . 4 . Data analyses The data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 ( SPM 8 : Welcome Department of Cognitive Neuroscience , UK ) in MATLAB 7 . 1 ( Mathworks ) . Slice timing correction was done before spatial processing . The functional image volumes were spatially realigned and coregistered to anatomical image volume , and then segmented and normalized to the standard brain template of the Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) ( Evans et al . , 1993 ) . Finally , the images were spatially smoothed by an 8 mm full width half - Maximum ( FWHM ) Gaussian kernel ( Worsley & Friston , 1995 ) . Individual analysis was performed using the general linear model . The BOLD signal was modeled as a canonical hemodynamic response function . The contrasts of interest were examined after estimation of condition effects at each voxel . Our contrasts included comparisons of the single solution analogical reasoning task versus the baseline task , the multiple solution analogical reasoning task versus the baseline task , and the multiple solution analogical rea - soning task versus the single solution analogical reasoning task . Each contrast produced a statistical parametric map . The resulting activations were computed by a voxelwise intensity threshold of p < 0 . 001 uncorrected and a cluster size of a minimum of ten con - tiguous voxels . These individual contrast images were then entered into a second - level analysis using a random - effect model ( Worsley , Evans , Marrett , & Neelin , 1992 ) . Activations that were within clus - ters of ten or more contiguous voxels and above the false discovery rate ( FDR ) ( Benjamini & Hochberg , 1995 ) corrected at a statistical threshold of p < 0 . 01 were considered to be signiﬁcant . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Behavioral data During the scanning , reaction time and completion rates were recorded . After scanning , participants completed a ques - tionnaire to recall and record their answers and rules while they were in the scanning session . This questionnaire revealed what solutions were generated in the participants’ mind dur - ing the scanning session of the experiment . This information contributed to subsequent analyses of reaction time and com - pletion rate . Statistical analyses ( Repeated ANOVA ) of behavioral data indicated signiﬁcant differences in the mean reaction time for performing the multiple solution analogical reasoning task ( M = 7538 ms , SEM = 325 ms ) , the single solution analogical rea - soning task ( M = 3020 ms , SEM = 169 ms ) and the baseline task ( M = 2958 ms , SEM = 147 ms ) , F ( 2 , 19 ) = 227 . 7 , P < 0 . 001 , (cid:2) 2 = 0 . 92 . Post - hoc multiple tests showed that there was no signiﬁcant dif - ference between the single solution analogical reasoning task and the baseline task ( M = 3020 ms , SEM = 169 ms vs . M = 2958 ms , SEM = 147 ms , p = 0 . 62 , (cid:2) 2 = 0 . 005 ) . And the differences were sig - niﬁcant between the multiple solution analogical reasoning task and the baseline task ( M = 7538 ms , SEM = 325 ms vs . M = 2958 ms , SEM = 147 ms , p < 0 . 001 , (cid:2) 2 = 0 . 93 ) as well as the multiple solution analogical reasoning task and the single solution analogical reason - ing task ( M = 7538 ms , SEM = 325 ms vs . M = 3020 ms , SEM = 169 ms , p < 0 . 001 , (cid:2) 2 = 0 . 92 ) . In addition , there were signiﬁcant differences in completion rate for performing the multiple solution analogical reasoning task ( M = 88 % , SEM = 1 . 5 % ) , the single solution analogical reasoning task ( M = 90 % , SEM = 2 . 1 % ) and the baseline task ( M = 98 % , SEM = 0 . 2 % ) . F ( 2 , 19 ) = 13 . 14 , p < 0 . 001 , (cid:2) 2 = 0 . 87 . Post - hoc multiple tests showed that differences were signiﬁcant between the single solution analogical reasoning task and the baseline task ( M = 90 % , SEM = 2 . 1 % vs . M = 98 % , SEM = 0 . 2 % , p < 0 . 005 , (cid:2) 2 = 0 . 84 ) .

M = 90 % , SEM = 2 . 1 % , p = 0 . 37 , (cid:2) 2 = 0 . 01 ) . This suggested that the multiple solution analogical reasoning task involved more mental operations , resulting in longer reaction times and lower completion rates . 3 . 2 . Neuroimaging data Three comparisons of experimental conditions were performed to examine the neural network underlying numerical divergent thinking in analogical reasoning tasks ( Table 1 ) . The ﬁrst compar - ison was the single solution analogical reasoning task versus the baseline task . This comparison revealed that the cognitive oper - ation of the single solution analogical reasoning task involved signiﬁcant activations within the left superior frontal gyrus ( BA 6 : x = − 8 , y = 20 , z = 56 ) , left middle frontal gyrus ( BA 10 : x = − 46 , y = 54 , z = − 12 ) , right postcentral gyrus ( BA 3 : x = 31 , y = − 25 , z = 45 ) , left precuneus ( BA 7 : x = − 5 , y = − 55 , z = 40 ) , right precuneus ( BA 7 : x = 22 , y = − 61 , z = 52 ) , left superior temporal gyrus ( BA 41 : x = − 39 , y = − 31 , z = 4 ) , right middle occipital gyrus ( BA 37 : x = 53 , y = − 61 , z = − 8 ) and right caudate ( x = 5 , y = 17 , z = 0 ) . The second analysis compared the multiple solution analogical reasoning task versus the baseline task . This comparison revealed that the cognitive operation of the multiple solution analogical rea - soning task involved signiﬁcant activations in left superior frontal gyrus ( BA 8 : x = − 22 , y = 24 , z = 40 ) , right superior frontal gyrus ( BA 8 : x = 29 , y = 30 , z = 44 ) , left middle frontal gyrus ( BA 10 : x = − 5 , y = 61 , z = 8 ) , right medial frontal gyrus ( BA 10 : x = 5 , y = 51 , z = − 16 ) , right postcentralgyrus ( BA 3 : x = 36 , y = − 17 , z = 48 ) , left middle tem - poral gyrus ( BA 21 : x = − 59 , y = − 4 , z = − 20 ) , right inferior temporal gyrus ( BA 20 : x = 53 , y = − 24 , z = − 24 ) , left parahippocampal region ( BA 28 : x = − 22 , y = − 21 , z = − 20 ) and right middle occipital gyrus ( BA 18 : x = 29 , y = − 99 , z = − 4 ) . The neural activity patterns involved with direct comparison between the multiple solution analogical reasoning task and the single solution analogical reasoning task might reﬂect crucial neu - ral components of divergent production of rules in numerical analogical reasoning . Therefore , we performed a third contrast of the multiple solution analogical reasoning task versus the single solution analogical reasoning task . This comparison revealed that the cognitive operation of the multiple solution analogical rea - soning task involved signiﬁcant activations in left superior frontal gyrus ( BA 8 : x = − 29 , y = 24 , z = 52 ) , right superior frontal gyrus ( BA 8 : x = 36 , y = 27 , z = 44 ) , left middle frontal gyrus ( BA 10 : x = − 5 , y = 61 , z = 8 ) , right middle frontal gyrus ( BA 10 : x = 36 , y = 45 , z = 30 ) , right postcentral gyrus ( BA 3 : x = 39 , y = − 24 , z = 48 ) , left inferior parietal lobule ( BA 40 : x = − 49 , y = − 58 , z = 44 ) , right middle tem - poral gyrus ( BA 39 : x = 49 , y = − 61 , z = 28 ) , right parahippocampal region ( BA 28 : x = 24 , y = − 10 , z = − 21 ) and right middle occipital gyrus ( BA 18 : x = 29 , y = − 98 , z = − 4 ) . The comparison contrast , of the single solution analogical reasoning task versus the multiple solution analogical reasoning task , involved signiﬁcant activation in left precuneus ( BA 7 : x = − 5 , y = − 60 , z = 50 ) . In order to examine whether task difﬁculty affected neural activ - ity , we performed a covariance analysis . Due to the fact that reaction time is often considered to be a cue to measure the difﬁculty of an experimental task , we entered reaction time as a covariate of no interest to reveal whether or not activations of regions were dependent upon task difﬁculty . When reaction time was entered as a covariate in the analysis , the comparison between the mul - tiple solution task and the single solution task showed signiﬁcant activations of speciﬁc brain regions ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) , which were the same as analyses conducted with reaction time not entered as a covariate . This analysis revealed that activation of the key regions , including BAs 10 , 40 and 8 were task speciﬁc , and not evoked by task difﬁculty ( Stephan et al . , 2003 ) . 4 . Discussion Numerical representation and mechanisms represent a cogni - tive and neural system that is different from verbal and pictorial processing ( Dehaene , 2005 ; Jia et al . , 2011 ; Cohen - Kadosh et al . , 2005 ; Piazza et al . , 2002 ; Richland et al . , 2007 ; Zhong et al . , 2011 ) . In particular , the creative process in numerical problem solving might involve diverse key components within this neural network . In the present study Hofstadter’s numerical analogical reasoning paradigm was used to examine neural mechanisms of numerical creative problem solving . Our experimental results revealed that , when the multiple solution analogical reasoning task was com - pared with the single solution analogical reasoning task , there were signiﬁcant activation in the right middle frontal cortex ( BA 10 ) , the left inferior parietal lobule ( BA 40 ) , and the superior frontal cortex ( BA 8 ) . The results suggest that , while the right BA 10 and left BA 40 are involved in the generation of novel rules , BA 8 is associated with the inhibition of initial rules in numerical analogical reasoning . The results of the present study have replicated previous studies of neural correlates of general numerical processing ( Jia et al . , 2011 ; Cohen - Kadosh et al . , 2005 ; Piazza et al . , 2002 ; Richland et al . , 2007 ; Zhong et al . , 2011 ) . More importantly , they have extended the body of existing knowledge to the neural mechanisms of creativity in numerical processing . There are both commonalities and differences between the sin - gle solution task and the multiple solution task . When viewed from the perspective of cognitive components involved , the sin - gle solution task of numerical analogical reasoning involves at least : number recognition ( Piazza et al . , 2002 ) , number magni - tude ( Dehaene , 1997 ) , number comparison ( Cohen - Kadosh et al . , 2005 ) , relational encoding , relational mapping , rule discovery , and 174 X . Wu et al . / Biological Psychology 117 ( 2016 ) 170 – 178 Fig . 2 . Cortical acitivity during divergent production of rules in numerical analogical reasoning tasks . This is cortical acitivity during divergent production of rules in numerical analogical reasoning . Regions of signiﬁcant activations are associated with performance in the multiple solution analogical reasoning task versus the single solution analogical reasoning task when reaction time was entered as a covariate . Planes are axial section . The signiﬁcance thresholds are P < 0 . 01 FDR - corrected with an extent threshod of 10 contiguous voxels . Functional maps shown at axial section are overlaid on the T1 - weighted images . answer output ( Bunge , Wendelken , Badre , & Wagner , 2005 ; Prat , Mason , & Just , 2012 ) . In contrast , the multiple solution task of numerical analogical reasoning not only involves number recogni - tion , number magnitude , number comparison , relational encoding , relational mapping , rule discovering , and answer output , but also requires participants to ﬁnd out a novel rule after they have the initial path to a solution . Thus , the generation of a novel rule along with the inhibition of an initial rule is unique , and critical to the multiple solution analogical reasoning task . Therefore , the con - trast between the multiple solution task and the single solution task reﬂects neural activity patterns underlying the generation of a novel rule , along with the inhibition of an initial rule . When viewed from the perspective of solutions appearing in two types of tasks , the solutions of the single solution task embody visual location relations ; on the contrary , the solutions of the multiple solution task embody abstract quantity relations and a visual location rela - tion . Thus , the contrast between the multiple solution task and the single solution task appears to reﬂect neural activity patterns of the brain provoked by abstract quantity relations . Previous stud - ies have demonstrated that abstract representation can lead to the generation of creative products in problem solving ( Ward , Smith , & Finke , 1999 ) . More importantly , visual location relations , belong - ing to shallow or physical processing , fall into the category of close associations in mental representations ; however , abstract quantity relations , belonging to deep or semantic processing , fall into the category of distant associations in mental representations . Accord - ing to theories of creativity , the formation of remote associations can initiate novel and appropriate solutions to a problem ( Mednick , 1962 ; Torrance , 1974 ) . Thus , it is plausible that the generation of a novel rule is carried out by the formation of remote associations in mental representations . Our neuroimaging data suggests that the formation of novel rules involves right BA 10 . This ﬁnding is consistent with previous studies of the creative process ( Bhattacharya , Gibson , & Doty , 2005 ; Chávez - Eakle et al . , 2007 ; de Souza et al . , 2010 ; Kowatari et al . , 2009 ; Shamay - Tsoory , Adler , Aharon - Peretz , Perry , & Mayseless , 2011 ) . For example , an fMRI study investigated the role of seman - tic distance in generating analogical solutions ( Green et al . , 2012 ) . In their 4 - term analogical reasoning tasks there were two types of relatedness based on semantic distance . Close semantic distance word - pairs involved the same conceptual category , for example , “blindness : sight : deafness : ? ” . In contrast , remote semantic dis - tance word - pairs were in two different conceptual categories , for example , “blindness : sight : poverty : ? ” . The experimental results showed that the left frontopolar cortex ( BA 9 / 10 ) along with several other regions was activated under remote semantic distance condi - tion relative to close semantic distance condition . Moreover , the left frontopolar cortex ( BA 9 / 10 ) covaried parametrically with increas - ing semantic distance . The researchers suggested that activation X .

Four regions showing signiﬁcant activations are associated with performance in the multiple solution analogical reasoning task versus the single solution analogical reasoning task when reaction time was entered as a covariate .

Functional maps shown at sagittal and coronal sections are overlaid on the T1 - weighted images . in the left frontopolar cortex ( BA 9 / 10 ) mediated the formation of remote semantic associations between distant semantic concepts . In the present study , we examined numerical divergent thinking in analogical reasoning . According to creativity principles , gener - ating a novel rule is mainly based on the formation of remote associations in mental representation ( Mednick , 1962 ; Torrance , 1974 ) . The ﬁrst solution to the multiple solution analogical rea - soning task participants used was based upon the rule of visual location relations . The second solution they often used was the rule of abstract quantity relations . Unlike visual location relations , involving close associations based on shallow or physical process - ing , abstract quantity relations likely involve remote associations based on deep or semantic processing . Such remote associations are in accordance with previous studies ( Green et al . , 2012 ; Howard - Jones et al . , 2005 ) , and are interpreted to lead to the formation of a novel rule in numerical analogical reasoning . Therefore , our 176 X . Wu et al . / Biological Psychology 117 ( 2016 ) 170 – 178 results suggested that the right middle frontal cortex ( BA 10 ) plays an important role in the generation of novel rules by the formation of such remote associations . The correspondence of activation in BA 10 between the Green et al . study and our experiment could serve to corroborate this region as important to more generalized formation of novel rules across both verbal and numeric domains . Consistent with lateralized ﬁndings of prior studies , verbal stimuli tasks are associated with greater activation in the left prefrontal cortex ( Bunge et al . , 2005 ) , while numerical tasks are associated with greater activation in the right cortex ( Gazzaniga & Hillyard , 1971 ) , although symbolic numerical abilities ( verbal counting and mathematic ) also have been noted to recruit regions within the left hemisphere ( e . g . , Chassy & Grodd , 2011 ) . The current ﬁnding is also consistent with an fMRI study of story composition ( Howard - Jones et al . , 2005 ) . In that study , participants were asked to generate creative stories , using unrelated words in different categories involved in the formation of remote seman - tic associations . Signiﬁcant neural activity was found in only one region : the right medial frontal cortex ( BA 10 ) . This is similar to the formation of remote associations for novel rules in numerical analogical reasoning . Although those researchers employed a ver - bal task , the story generation task was associated with activation within the right hemisphere to complete holistic rearrangement of ideas ( Katz , 1978 ; Levy - Agresti & Sperry , 1968 ) . Their results have further supported that notion that right BA 10 is a key com - ponent of neural networks underlying the generation of novel rules by the formation of remote associations in divergent thinking tasks ( including numerical analogies ) . It is worth noting that researchers have recently found that the left inferior parietal lobule ( BA 40 ) is recruited during production of remote semantic associations ( Bechtereva et al . , 2004 ; Sohn , Ursu , Anderson , Stenger , & Carter , 2000 ) . For example , Benedek et al . ( 2014 ) found that the left inferior parietal cortex ( BA 40 ) was activated while participants generating new ideas compared with the retrieval of old ideas . The researchers suggested that activation in this region was involved with ﬂexible integration of knowledge for the construction of new ideas . In another study , when partic - ipants generated a story using a word list of different semantic categories , the results showed signiﬁcant activation at BA 40 of the left inferior parietal cortex ( Bechtereva et al . , 2004 ) . The authors argued that BA 40 was responsible for remote semantic associations among irrelevant words in different categories . Moreover , Aydin et al . ( 2007 ) used voxel - based morphometry approach to examine the gray and white matter density differences in mathematicians and control participants . They found that gray matter density in the bilateral inferior parietal lobules and left inferior frontal lobe of the mathematicians was signiﬁcantly increased relative to the control participants . These regions of the brain are involved in arithmetic processing , especially the inferior parietal lobule , which has been implicated in high - level mathematic reasoning requiring visuospa - tial representation , creation of mental imagery , and manipulation of three - dimension objects . Their results suggested that increased gray matter density in these cortical regions ( e . g . , the inferior pari - etal BA 40 and the inferior frontal gyrus ) related to mathematic thinking ( Aydin et al . , 2007 ) . We infer that the left inferior parietal BA 40 is implicated in “ﬂexible integration of knowledge for the construction of new ideas” as suggested by Benedek et al . On the whole , it is likely that BA 10 and BA 40 are key components of a cortical network contributing to the formation of remote semantic associations for new rules or ideas . The superior frontal cortex ( BA 8 ) is hypothesized to be asso - ciated with initial rule inhibition in the present study , as this cognitive skill is necessary to minimize interference from prepo - tent responses ( i . e . , the ﬁrst solution ) when looking for the second solution . Inhibition has been recognized as an important cogni - tive process in cognitive conﬂict and task switching paradigms ( DiGirolamo et al . , 2001 ; Friedman & Miyake , 2004 ; Milham , Banich , & Barad , 2003 ; Miyake et al . , 2000 ) . For example , the results of an fMRI study of the Stroop phenomenon ( Milham et al . , 2002 ) showed increasing neural activity in the superior frontal cortex ( BA 8 ) associated with inhibiting word meaning under conﬂict condi - tions . Interestingly , activation in the superior frontal cortex ( BA 8 ) was observed in our results , and this region may be recruited to inhibit the interference of the initial rule in numerical analog - ical reasoning . We interpret our results as consistent with this ﬁnding : to ﬁnd a second solution , participants had to inhibit the initial rule of the ﬁrst solution . This is further supported by evi - dence supporting the notion that the superior frontal cortex is involved in suppressing an invalid or inappropriate selection in an unrelated - analogy ( Bunge et al . , 2005 ; Krawczyk et al . , 2010 ; MacDonald , Cohen , Stenger , & Carter , 2000 ) and inhibits or rejects no - go responses in go / no - go tasks ( Konishi et al . , 1999 ; Liddle , Kiehl , Smith , 2001 ) . Finally , activation in the parahippocampus ( BA 28 ) was observed in our study . The parahippocampus and hippocampus have been related to novel encoding in previous studies ( Grady et al . , 1995 ; Stern et al . , 1996 ; Tulving , Markowitsch , Kapur , Habib , & Houle , 1994 ) . Positron emission tomography studies showed increasing blood ﬂow in the parahippocampus and hippocampus to be associated with novelty encoding of new pictures compared with repeated pictures ( Tulving et al . , 1994 ) and identiﬁcation of novel faces compared with old faces ( Grady et al . , 1995 ) . For example , when participants were required to indicate which pic - tures were presented previously and which pictures were new , signiﬁcant activation under new picture stimulus condition was observed in the adjacent parahippocampus and posterior portion of the hippocampus ( Stern et al . , 1996 ) . In our study , when partic - ipants generate a novel rule , it was mapped from the ﬁrst analogy pair to the second analogy pair for a new answer’s number . Our neuroimaging results further supported this proposition . That is , involvement of the parahippocampus may be associated with pro - cessing of a new answer’s number while the novel rule is mapped in numerical analogical reasoning . In addition , there were activations in the left middle frontal cor - tex ( BA 10 ) , the middle occipital cortex ( BA 18 ) , and postcentral cortex ( BA 3 ) in the contrasts of our results : the single solution analogical reasoning task minus the baseline , the multiple solu - tion analogical reasoning task minus the baseline , and the multiple solution analogical reasoning task minus the single solution ana - logical reasoning task . Activation of these regions of the brain is associated with basic numerical processing in the analogical rea - soning task . Activation in the left prefrontal lobe , especially BA 10 is consistent with relational integration in general analogical rea - soning ( Bunge et al . , 2005 ; Luo et al . , 2003 ; Prat et al . , 2012 ; Watson & Chatterjee , 2012 ; Wendelken , Nakhabenko , Donohue , Carter , & Bunge , 2008 ) . Previous studies have found the parietal ( postcen - tral BA 3 ) cortex to be associated with modality - speciﬁc activity such as number comparison ( Cohen - Kadosh et al . , 2005 ) , arithmetic operation ( Dehaene , 2005 ; Ischebeck et al . , 2006 ) , number series completion tasks ( Zhong et al . , 2011 ) , numerical inductive reason - ing ( Jia et al . , 2011 ) and counting ( Piazza et al . , 2002 ) . Moreover , the middle occipital cortex ( BA 18 ) is responsible for spatial processing and picture - speciﬁc processing ( Renier et al . , 2010 ; Vandenberghe et al . , 1996 ) . The middle temporal gyrus ( BA 39 ) serves to facili - tate the production of visual number form in numerical processing ( Dehaene & Cohen , 1995 ) . It is apparent that involvement of such neural networks is necessary to carry out basic components of numerical representation in analogical reasoning . There were several limitations of this study . First , the partici - pants were comprised of a well - educated , young cohort , with no neurological or psychiatric diagnoses . The generalizability of these ﬁndings to other cohorts must await support from larger studies X . Wu et al . / Biological Psychology 117 ( 2016 ) 170 – 178 177 with broader demographic characteristics . It should be noted , how - ever , that mathematical reasoning , analogy , and creativity , would be most beneﬁcial to individuals pursuing academic careers ; thus this initial study obtained within a college cohort provides a strong foundation upon which future studies might build . Second , we limited our study to mathematical creativity , and contrasting the neural activations found in our study directly to those obtained with verbal analogies would signiﬁcantly strengthen the inferences made regarding the central role of BA 10 in generation of a novel rules , formation of remote associations , and rule representation . In actuality , divergent production of rules is likely to be complex and multitudinous . Future studies which combine mathematical , visuospatial , and verbal analogies will help to determine the spe - ciﬁc neural components that are central to creative rule production across domains . Finally , we are limited in examining functional activations in isolation from structural components that have been associated with both creativity ( Jung , Mead , Carrasco , & Flores , 2013 ) , and numerical ability ( Aydin et al . , 2007 ) . We have made some inferences regarding structure - function relationships ; how - ever , simultaneous analysis of both structure and function , within the same cohort , would tend to strengthen such inferences . In summary , we have established a relationship between the production of new rules in numerical analogical reasoning and acti - vation within a network of brain regions that conform to those observed in verbal analogies ( BA 10 ) , production of remote seman - tic associations ( BA 40 ) , and inhibition of prepotent responses ( BA 8 ) . While the results were speciﬁc to the rule production of numerical analogies , previous empirical results would support the notion that this network of brain regions is involved , more gen - erally , in the production of divergent analogies across domains . Future studies involving broader demographic cohorts and utiliz - ing tasks across multiple analogy domains ( verbal , mathematical , visuo - spatial ) , should help to determine whether such neural net - works are domain general or whether they are speciﬁc to the domain in which the participant is producing creative divergent analogies .
