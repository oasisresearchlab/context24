Previous studies have identiﬁed that the frontal , parietal , and occipital cortex in the cognitive control network selectively activated in response to chunk tightness , however , functional localization strategy may overlook the interaction brain regions . Based on the notion of a global brain network , we proposed that multiple specialized regions have to be interconnected to maintain goal representation during the course of chunk decomposition . Therefore , the present study applied a beta - series correlation method to investigate interregional functional connectivity in the event - related design of chunk decomposition tasks using Chinese characters , which would highlight critical nodes irrespective to chunk tightness . The results reveal a network of functional hubs with highly within or between module connections , including the orbitofrontal cortex , superior / inferior parietal lobule , hippocampus , and thalamus . We speculate that the thalamus integrates information across modular as an integrative hub while the orbitofrontal cortex tracks the mental states of chunk decomposition on a moment - to - moment basis . The superior and inferior parietal lobule collaborate to manipulate the mental representation of chunk decomposition and the hippocampus associates the relationship between elements in the question and solution phase . Furthermore , the tightness of chunks is not only associated with diﬀerent processors in visual systems but also leads to increased intermodular connections in right superior frontal gyrus and left precentral gyrus . To summary up , the present study ﬁrst reveals the task - modulated brain network of chunk decomposition in addition to the tightness - related nodes in the frontal and occipital cortex . 1 . Introduction Problem solving is a higher - order cognitive process and intellectual function in order to adapt ﬂexibly to the changing and complex envi - ronment ( Goldstein and Levin , 1987 ) . In psychology , this phenomenon is characterized by suddenly and abruptly moving from a state of not knowing how to solve a problem to a state of knowing how to solve it ( Metcalfe , 1986 ; Shen et al . , 2018 ) . The moment that suddenly came up ∗ Corresponding authors at : Gansu Provincial Key Laboratory of Wearable Computing , School of Information Science and Engineering , Lanzhou University , No . 222 South Tianshui Road , Lanzhou , Gansu 730000 , China .

Chunk decomposition , which refers to decomposing a uni - ﬁed chunk into component elements , is a particular example of mental representation ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 ; Luo et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , we aim to investigate the cognitive pattern underlying chunk decomposi - tion using functional neuroimaging technique . In the study of chunk decomposition , the most famous one is the matchstick arithmetic which is made up of a false arithmetic statement https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . neuroimage . 2021 . 118826 .

NeuroImage 247 ( 2022 ) 118826 with roman numerals ( e . g . , Ⅰ , Ⅱ , Ⅲ , Ⅳ ) , arithmetic operations ( + , − ) and an equal sign ( = ) constructed out of matchsticks ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 ) . During the experiment , participants are required to transform the initial false statement into a true arithmetic equation by moving a single stick . For example , problem solvers are easy to transform the equation ‘ Ⅱ = Ⅲ + Ⅰ ’ to ‘ Ⅲ = Ⅱ + Ⅰ ’ whereas are diﬃcult to trans - form the statement ‘ Ⅵ = Ⅷ + Ⅲ ’ to ‘ Ⅺ = Ⅷ + Ⅲ ’ . That is be - cause ‘ Ⅲ ’ is a loose chunk consisting of meaningful small chunks ( ‘ Ⅱ ’ and ‘ Ⅰ ’ ) , nevertheless , ‘ Ⅴ ’ and ‘ Ⅹ ’ are tight chunks because the to - be - removed parts ( ‘ \ ’ and ‘ / ’ ) are not meaningful chunks . However , the lack of trial variation in the matchstick roman arithmetic makes it im - possible to guarantee reliable neuroimaging analyses . To solve the issue , Luo and Knoblich ( 2007 ) developed a series of functional magnetic res - onance imaging ( fMRI ) , eye - movement recordings , event - related poten - tial ( ERP ) , and combined fMRI and ERP studies of chunk decomposition using Chinese characters as the materials . Previous neuroimaging researches have revealed three major ﬁnd - ings of chunk decomposition in problem solving . First , chunk decompo - sition recruits the cognitive control network , including the anterior cin - gulate cortex , the inferior frontal junction , the pre - supplementary motor area , and the lateral prefrontal cortex ( Huang et al . , 2015 ; Tang et al . , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 2013 ) . Second , the early visual cortex which may serve to the inhibition of automatic perceptual chunking was observed as a deactivation during chunk decomposition ( Luo et al . , 2006 ; Wu et al . , 2009 ) . Third , the activation of the hippocampus in chunk decompo - sition establishes novel or non - salient associations between seemingly irrelevant information ( Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ; Luo and Niki , 2003 ; Shen et al . , 2018 ) . In short , brain regions mentioned above during chunk decomposition are involved in special executive , perceptual , and remote association . Researchers in the ﬁeld of chunk decomposition with Chinese char - acters tended to employ the functional localization strategy to iden - tiﬁed disconnected / segregative brain activation and deactivation that is the specialization of brain regions during the course of chunk de - composition . However , the functional localization strategy fails to ac - count for interactions or functional integration among diﬀerent brain regions . Hence , deciphering the secret of whole - brain interaction from the perspective of a global brain network is quite essential for chunk decomposition . Inspired by the idea of the global neuronal workspace ( GNW ) model ( Dehaene et al . , 1998 ) that highlights the interconnec - tion of multiple brain systems through a network of neurons ( global workspace ) ( Mashour et al . , 2020 ) , we draw on its idea that the whole - brain network is grouped into two main computational spaces , the one is the processing network and the other is the global workspace . According to this idea , we also treat the brain as a set of special - ized processors and integrative processors in the light of the role of nodes ( local & connector hub ) . As a result , we have paved the way for investigating the whole - brain interaction pattern during chunk decomposition . To model the cognitive pattern of chunk decomposition , we con - struct a network based on correlation of a series of beta - values in an event - related design , which is ﬁtted to the evoked activity in each trial as a separate covariate in the general linear model ( GLM ) ( Gottlich et al . , 2015 ) . In this way , we can examine the interplay of diﬀerent brain re - gions executing chunk decomposition tasks and regions crucial for net - work integration . After all , previous research of regional brain activation during chunk decomposition did not provide exact information whether activated areas actually integrate distinct brain modules . In fact , the hu - man brain is composed of modular functional networks ( Bertolero et al . , 2015 ) , which comprise local hubs ( mediating within - network commu - nication ) and connector hubs ( integrating communication between net - works ) ( Bertolero et al . , 2018 ; Hwang et al . , 2017 ) . In neuroscience , specialized cortical functions are believed to rely on so - called local hubs ( Guimera and Amaral , 2005 ) . More complex functions , especially cog - nitive ones , require the cooperation of multiple local networks through so - called connector hubs ( Bertolero et al . , 2015 ) . Accordingly , we em - Fig . 1 . Experimental paradigm . Participants were instructed to remove the rad - ical or stroke from the Chinese character . ( A ) The levels of chunk decomposi - tion . Three levels of chunk decomposition were determined by the spatial re - lationship between the target characters and their to - be - removed parts . The paradigm / stimuli shown in the formal experiment is actually white on a black background . The reason why they are marked as green , blue and purple in the Fig . 1 is to distinguish the diﬃculty of tasks so as to be more intuitive . ( B ) The design of an easy trial . A central asterisk lasted for 1000 ms at the beginning of the trial . During the subsequent question phase , the target character and the to - be - removed parts appear on the screen for up to 8000 ms ( or until a response key was pressed ) . Subsequent to a ﬁxation delay of 1000 ms , the answer char - acter was presented for up to 3000 ms or until a response was collected . The ﬁnal black screen during the inter - trial - interval varied randomly from 2500 to 4000 ms . ploy graph - theoretic measures to estimate local and connector hub prop - erties of chunk decomposition . Furthermore , this study also probes the cognitive state of chunk decomposition , namely perceptual processing and cognitive processing . In this study , we introduced three diﬃculty levels ( loose / easy , in - termediate , and tight / hard ) of chunk decomposition with Chinese char - acters ( Fig . 1 A ) which were classiﬁed based on the spatial relationship between to - be - removed parts and characters . During the scanning , par - ticipants were instructed to mentally decompose the Chinese charac - ter chunk to make up a solution with the help of cues . For example , participants made an eﬀort to decompose the strokes ‘ (cid:2) ’ ( er , meaning two ) from the question character ‘ (cid:2) ’ ( jia , meaning clip ) to get the new target character ‘‘ ' ‘«’ ( huo , meaning ﬁre ) in the hard condition . What’s more , this cueing way prevents participants from inferring from rele - vant solutions themselves and adopts the instructed way of reconstruct - ing . Consequently , it can also ensure the stability of creative thinking and provide the possibility to delineate the neural mechanism of cog - nitive pattern and state corresponding to the diﬃculty level of chunk decomposition . As mentioned above , the chunk decomposition task requires ma - nipulate mental representation of Chinese characters in a goal - directed way , we thus hypothesize that the decomposing chunk will promote the brain to form a large - scale integration network , which could not be cap - tured by the functional localization strategy . With respect to the eﬀect of chunk tightness , a cognitive control network widely distributed has been revealed by a parametric design , but it would be of great inter - est to investigate the diﬀerence of measures relevant to functional net - works . Previous studies found network integration increase in response to the demand of cognitive eﬀorts during an n - back working memory task ( Kitzbichler et al . , 2011 ; Vatansever et al . , 2015 ) , so we would pre - dict that the tightness of chunk may result in high levels of long - range or intermodular connections . 2 J . Pang , H . Guo , X . Tang et al . NeuroImage 247 ( 2022 ) 118826 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Participants Twenty - two students ( 11 females ; aged 19 - 26 years ) were recruited in this study as paid volunteers . All of them were right - handed , had nor - mal or corrected - to - normal vision , and reported no history of neurologi - cal or psychiatric disorders . The study was approved by the institutional review board of Beijing Normal University Imaging Center for Brain Re - search , and all participants signed informed consent forms before the experiment . 2 . 2 . Materials Chinese characters that carry multiple information ( e . g . , ortho - graphic , semantic information ) constitute a spatial rather than a phono - logical system , and compose of strokes and radicals . That is why Chinese characters are ideal examples of perceptual chunks ( Luo et al . , 2006 ) . In the study , three diﬃculty levels of chunk decomposition were employed ( Fig . 1 A ) and the levels of chunking were classiﬁed based on the spatial relationship between to - be - removed parts and characters . In the easy condition ( Level 1 , loose ) , the perceptual subcomponents of the chunk were spatially separated . As is shown in Fig . 1 A , the loose chunk ‘ (cid:2) ’ ( di , meaning land ) encompasses two spatially independent subcomponents ‘ (cid:3) ’ ( tu , meaning soil ) and ‘ (cid:3) ’ ( ye , meaning also ) , just like the roman numeral ‘ Ⅲ ’ consisting of ‘ Ⅱ ’ and ‘ Ⅰ ’ in the Introduction section , wherein the question character ‘ (cid:2) ’ can be decomposed into ‘ (cid:3) ’ by removing the radical ‘ (cid:3) ’ . In contrast , to - be - removed parts were peripherally adjacent to and embedded in Chinese characters in the medium - diﬃcult ( Level 2 , intermediate ) and hard condition ( Level 3 , tight ) , respectively . For instance , removing the stroke ‘ (cid:4) ’ ( pie , meaningless character ) periph - erally adjacent to the Chinese character ‘ (cid:5) ’ ( fa , meaning tired ) can gen - erate the solution ‘ (cid:6) ’ ( zhi , meaning of ) , and taking out the strokes ‘ (cid:2) ’ ( er , meaning two ) embedded in the question character ‘ (cid:2) ’ ( jia , mean - ing clip ) can laboriously get the new target character ‘ (cid:2) ’ ( huo , mean - ing ﬁre ) , just like it is hard to decompose the tight roman numeral ‘ Ⅴ ’ into ‘ \ ’ and ‘ / ’ . The word frequency eﬀect and stroke number eﬀect of Chinese characters also inﬂuence the brain cognition ( Kuo et al . , 2003 ; Lee et al . , 2004 ) . However , Yu and Cao ( 1992 ) have demonstrated that stroke number aﬀects the reaction time of recognizing Chinese char - acters only if the number of strokes is greatly diﬀerent . To eliminate these factors , all Chinese characters as experimental materials are high frequency and have similar stroke numbers . 2 . 3 . Procedure During the scan , participants were required to decompose strokes or radicals from Chinese characters ( Question Phase ) to make up new char - acters ( Answer Phase ) . The three diﬀerent levels of tasks were presented via an LCD projector onto a mirror placed in front of the participant in the scanner . In the question phase of Fig . 1 B , the left is Chinese charac - ters and the right is strokes or radicals which were connected by a minus sign . Participants had 8 s to think of a new character by removing a part of the original character and they were asked to press a response button as soon as they generated an answer . Next , they need to judge whether their answer was the same as the character displayed on the subsequent screen within 3 s . Besides , the resting interval among each trial was ran - domly arranged from 2 . 5 to 4 s . There were 30 trials for each level of stimuli and 30 trials with no requirement to decompose characters as a baseline condition . Additionally , there were other 90 ﬁller trials which served to keep the attention of participants , and that required chunking processes . Therefore , a total of 210 trials were randomized into the 5 sessions that each lasted 10 min . 2 . 4 . fMRI data acquisition and preprocessing Brain imaging data were obtained using a 3 - Tesla Siemens TIM scan - ner with a standard radiofrequency head coil at the State Key Labora - tory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning , Beijing Normal University . Blood oxygen level - dependent ( BOLD ) images were acquired in an inter - leaved fashion with a T 2 ∗ - weighted gradient - echo echo - planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence ( 30 axial slices , 4 mm slice thickness , 0 . 8 mm slice gap , repetition time = 2000 ms , echo time = 30 ms , ﬁeld of view = 200 mm × 200 mm , 90° ﬂip angle ) . Further , high - resolution structural im - ages for spatial referencing were acquired using a T 1 - weighted 3D gradient - echo pulse sequence ( voxel dimensions 1 . 33 × 1 . 33 × 1 . 33 mm , 128 sagittal slices , repetition time = 2530 ms , echo time = 3 . 39 ms , ﬁeld of view = 256 mm × 256 mm , 8° ﬂip angle ) . Image preprocessing was conducted using the Statistical Para - metric Mapping software ( SPM8 , Wellcome Department of Cogni - tive Neurology , UCL , London , UK , http : / / www . ﬁl . ion . ucl . ac . uk / spm ) ( Friston et al . , 1994 ) . For preprocessing , the ﬁrst four volumes of each run were discarded to avoid a potential T 1 - equilibration eﬀect , and remaining images were corrected for slice acquisition - dependent time shifts . Then , the images within each run were corrected for head mo - tion using rigid - body translation , co - registered with the corresponding T 1 - weighted image , and spatially normalized ( 3 - mm isotropic voxels ) into the Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) space . Finally , the nor - malized images were smoothed with an 8 - mm Gaussian kernel full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) and high - pass ﬁltered with a 128 - s cutoﬀ pe - riod . 2 . 5 . Overview The general schematic for multiple specialized regions interconnect - ing is illustrated in Fig . 2 . After preprocessing , a whole brain atlas de - rived from the Human Brainnetome Atlas ( Fan et al . , 2016 ) was used to divide the brain into 246 regions . Then , a series of beta - values for each region on the basis of a GLM was extracted to estimate the condition - speciﬁc network using beta - series correlation . Inspired by the idea of the global workspace theory , the cognitive pattern underlying the chunk de - composition with three conditions ( easy , intermediate , and hard ) was modeled by assessing participation coeﬃcient and within - community degree based on condition - speciﬁc global brain network . Finally , the network - based statistic method was applied to localize subnetworks which are signiﬁcant diﬀerences among diﬀerent conditions . In the fol - lowing subsections of “Materials and Methods ” , these methods were de - scribed in more detail . 2 . 6 . Network construction The functional connectivity between brain regions was es - tablished via beta - series correlation , which allows investigat - ing interregional functional connectivity in event - related fMRI data using the BetA - Series COrrelation software ( BASCO v2 . 0 , https : / / www . nitrc . org / projects / basco / ) . A detailed introduction of the methods used in this toolbox and its functionality can be found in Gottlich et al . ( 2015 ) . This approach was ﬁrst introduced by Rissman et al . ( 2004 ) and allows investigating inter - regional functional connectivity in event - related fMRI data . The method is implemented on the basis of a general linear model where the evoked brain activity in each trial is modeled by a separate covariate time - locked to the stimulus onset . The results in a series of beta - values for each voxel were related to a given experimental condition and the functional connectivity was derived from correlating beta - series ( Gottlich et al . , 2015 ) . More importantly , most of researches using this method have found a lot of eﬀective ﬁndings ( Antonucci et al . , 2020 ; Göttlich et al . , 2017 ; Ye et al . , 2011 ) . Firstly , the Brainnetome Atlas was used to deﬁne the 246 nodes ( rep - resenting some distinct collections of brain tissue ) in the study because it 3 J . Pang , H . Guo , X . Tang et al . NeuroImage 247 ( 2022 ) 118826 Fig . 2 . A general schematic for multiple specialized regions interconnecting . was the atlas that met all of the following advantages : 1 ) it establishes a priori , biologically valid brain parcellation scheme of the entire cortical and subcortical gray matter into subregions showing a coherent pattern of anatomical connections , 2 ) it provides detailed characterizations of the structural and functional connectivity patterns for these , and 3 ) it de - codes brain functions by establishing those tasks and contrasts that acti - vated the respective area above chance in previous task - based functional neuroimaging studies ( Fan et al . , 2016 ) . Secondly , subject - level analysis was conducted based on GLM for each of the 246 ROIs . Subject - speciﬁc GLM was modeled by entering trial type - speciﬁc regressors ( easy , in - termediate , and hard ) , each convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function and included six motion regressors and their deriva - tives . Further , 246 ROIs’ vectors of beta - values were obtained for each trial type - speciﬁc per subject . Then , the trial type - speciﬁc functional connectivity was acquired by correlating the trial type - speciﬁc beta - coeﬃcient vectors using the Pearson correlation . Finally , the functional 4 J . Pang , H . Guo , X . Tang et al . NeuroImage 247 ( 2022 ) 118826 connectivity was normalized using an arc - hyperbolic tangent transform for network - statistics , yielding three trial type - speciﬁc ( easy , intermedi - ate , and hard ) 246 × 246 connectivity matrices per subject . 2 . 7 . Cognitive pattern modeling To model the cognitive pattern in chunk decomposition , the idea of the global neuronal workspace model is adopted . The model con - sists of two main computational spaces , the one is a specialized and modular processing network , and the other is a global workspace . The modular processing subnetwork is characterized by highly local connec - tions with speciﬁc cognitive functions , and the global workspace plays a part in interconnecting the multiple specialized processing subnetwork ( Dehaene and Changeux , 2011 ; Dehaene et al . , 1998 ) . In the graph the - ory analysis , the local hub and the connector hub derived from the node role approach ( Bertolero et al . , 2018 ) show a close match with the nature of the modular processing subnetwork and the global workspace . Local hubs that are ideally wired for segregated processing refer to having many connections within their own communities , however , connector hubs which are ideally wired for integrative processing have connec - tions diversely distributed across communities ( Bertolero et al . , 2018 ; Bertolero et al . , 2017 ; Guimera and Amaral , 2005 ) . Due to similar role in the global brain network , the connector hub and the local hub in the node role approach can be used to model the global workspace and the processing network , respectively . Therefore , the node role approach is also eﬀective for identifying the cognitive pattern of chunk decomposi - tion with Chinese characters . Hubs ( a component of a network with a high - degree node ) were calculated as originally deﬁned by Guimera and Amaral ( 2005 ) . In a weighted and undirected graph with 𝑛 nodes and 𝑚 edges , the strength of a node is given by 𝑘 𝑖 = ∑ 𝑗 𝑀 𝑖𝑗 where 𝑀 𝑖𝑗 is the edge weight between 𝑖 and 𝑗 in the correlation matrix 𝑀 . The modularity ( Q ) can be written as 𝑄 = 1 2 𝑚 ∑ 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗 ( 𝑀 𝑖𝑗 − 𝛾𝑝 𝑖𝑗 ) 𝛿 ( 𝑐 𝑖 , 𝑐 𝑗 ) Here , γ is the resolution parameter , 𝑝 𝑖𝑗 is the probability of nodes 𝑖 and 𝑗 connected in a random null network 𝑝 𝑖𝑗 = 𝑘 𝑖 𝑘 𝑗 2 𝑚 and 𝑐 𝑖 is the community to which node 𝑖 belongs 𝛿 ( 𝛼 , 𝛽 ) = { 1 𝑖𝑓 𝛼 = 𝛽 0 𝑖𝑓 𝛼 ≠ 𝛽 After obtaining communities ( referring to functional blocks in the organization of brain networks ) , the participation coeﬃcient ( PC ) can be calculated . The PC of node 𝑖 is deﬁned as 𝑃 𝐶 𝑖 = 1 − 𝑁 𝑀 ∑ 𝑠 = 1 ( 𝐾 𝑖𝑠 𝐾 𝑖 ) 2 where 𝑁 𝑀 is the total number of communities , 𝐾 𝑖 is the sum of 𝑖 ’s edge weights and 𝐾 𝑖𝑠 is the sum of 𝑖 ’s edge weights to community 𝑠 . The participation coeﬃcient of a node is therefore maximal if its edges are uniformly distributed among all the modules and 0 if all of edges are within its own module . Finally , the within - community degree ( WMD ) is deﬁned as follows : WM D 𝑖 = 𝑘 𝑖 − ̄𝑘 𝑠 𝑖 𝜎 𝑘 𝑠 𝑖 where 𝑘 𝑖 is the number of edges between node 𝑖 and other nodes in community 𝑠 𝑖 , ̄𝑘 𝑠 𝑖 is the average of 𝑘 over all of nodes in community 𝑠 𝑖 , Table 1 Accuracy and reaction time of the baseline and decomposi - tion conditions , with standard deviation in parentheses . Accuracy Reaction time Baseline 97 . 42 % ( 5 . 24 % ) 864 . 42ms ( 194 . 26ms ) Easy 96 . 97 % ( 7 . 90 % ) 1222 . 02ms ( 246 . 08ms ) Intermediate 94 . 39 % ( 7 . 08 % ) 1844 . 68ms ( 408 . 18ms ) Hard 86 . 21 % ( 11 . 09 % ) 2765 . 27ms ( 686 . 24ms ) and 𝜎 𝑘 𝑠 𝑖 is the standard deviation of 𝑘 in 𝑠 𝑖 . The WMD measures how well - connected node 𝑖 is to other nodes in the community . The ﬁnal participation coeﬃcient and within - community degree of each subject were the mean of those values across a range of net - work sparse costs ( 0 . 05 - 0 . 15 at 0 . 01 intervals ) ( Caterina et al . , 2012 ; Power et al . , 2011 ) . The hubs were eventually identiﬁed by PC and WMD , wherein WMD identiﬁed hubs , and then PC classiﬁed hub type ( Meunier et al . , 2010 ; Yong et al . , 2009 ) . Some investigators deﬁned a local hub according to a high WMD ( 1 . 5 - 2 . 5 ) and a low PC , while a high WMD and a high PC ( 0 . 3 - 0 . 8 ) can be deﬁned as a connector hub ( Cohen and D’Esposito , 2016 ; Guimera and Amaral , 2005 ) . Be - cause of diﬀerences in the networks and the methods , we adjusted the range of high PC and WMD accordingly . All graph theory analyses were executed with Bertolero’s Python code ( https : / / github . com / mb3152 / brain _ graphs ) that used the iGraph library ( Bertolero et al . , 2018 ) . In order to examine which hubs contribute more to information inte - gration , the average PC and WMD were calculated in each gyrus . A one - way within - subjects analysis of variance ( rmANOVA ) was performed to detect diﬀerences among three levels of chunk decomposition . Then , the post - hoc comparisons ( Bonferroni corrected ) were applied across the gyri with diﬀerences . In this way , a new insight was provided for chunk decomposition to explore the segregation and integration of in - formation processing . 2 . 8 . Network - based statistic To further localize connectivity in which brain region pair was signif - icant diﬀerence among three experimental conditions , a network - based statistic ( NBS , https : / / sites . google . com / site / bctnet / comparison / nbs ) approach was employed ( Zalesky et al . , 2012 ; Zalesky et al . , 2010 ) . The NBS is a non - parametric multiple comparison procedure for identifying the diﬀerences of structural and functional network . In brief , a primary component - forming threshold 3 . 8 ( d . f . = 21 , p < 0 . 001 , uncorrected ) was ﬁrst applied to the t statistic ( one - tailed paired t - test ) and there - fore formed a set of supra - threshold edges . Any connected components included in the set of supra - threshold edges were conducted based on breadth - ﬁrst search ( Ahuja et al . , 1994 ) and the number of edges they comprised , or their size , was stored ( Zalesky et al . , 2010 ) . This identi - ﬁed all the possible connected components or subnetworks in the uncor - rected level . Next , to correct p value for each component , an empirical null distribution of maximal connected component size was derived us - ing a non - parametric permutation approach ( 10000 permutations ) . Fi - nally , networks that were signiﬁcant at a corrected level of p < 0 . 05 were reported . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Behavioral results For the baseline and decomposition conditions , behavioral perfor - mances are shown in Table 1 . A repeated - measures analysis of vari - ance was conducted to examine the participants’ accuracy ( ACC ) and the reaction time ( RT ) of the correct solutions among these conditions . The results showed highly signiﬁcant eﬀects on the ACC ( 𝐹 ( 3 , 84 ) = 29 . 28 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) and RT ( 𝐹 ( 3 , 84 ) = 171 . 87 , 𝑃 < 0 . 001 ) . Post - hoc com - parisons ( Bonferroni corrected ) demonstrated that participants per - 5 J . Pang , H . Guo , X . Tang et al . NeuroImage 247 ( 2022 ) 118826 Fig . 3 . Behavioral performance .

Our results showed that there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in easy versus intermediate ( ACC : 𝑝 = 0 . 007 ; RT : 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) , and intermediate versus hard ( ACC : 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ; RT : 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . The ACC between baseline and loose chunk condition was not signiﬁcant ( 𝑃 = 0 . 525 ) but their RT reached statistical signiﬁcance ( 𝑃 < 0 . 001 ) . 3 . 2 . Characterization of cognitive pattern To further characterize the cognitive pattern of chunk decomposi - tion , a graph theory approach was used to identify connector & local hub brain regions , which may drive activity within the network and thus be a critical neural mechanism in creative thinking . According to accepted criteria and network characteristics , a high PC was consid - ered greater than 0 . 3 and a high WMD was considered greater than 0 . 2 ( Meunier et al . , 2009 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Generally , most of the hubs located in the thalamus ( Tha ) , the hippocampus ( Hipp ) , the orbitofrontal gyrus ( OFC ) , and the supe - rior / inferior parietal lobe ( SPL / IPL ) ( Fig . 4 A ) are overlapped regardless of the tightness of the Chinese character chunk , whereas a few hubs in - cluding the medio ventral occipital cortex ( MVOcC ) , the lateral occipital cortex ( LOcC ) , and the fusiform gyrus ( FuG ) ( Fig . 4 B ) slightly shifted . The MVOcC as a connector hub in the easy condition shifts to a periph - eral node in the intermediate and hard conditions . The LOcC transfers from local hub in the easy condition through local hub with the interme - diate condition gradually to peripheral node in the hard condition . Also , the FuG diverts from peripheral node in the easy condition to connector hub in the intermediate and hard conditions . In the easy condition , the connector hubs ( 𝑃 𝐶 ≥ 0 . 3 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑊 𝑀𝐷 ≥ 0 . 2 ) were mainly concentrated in the medio ventral occipital cortex and thalamus ; the local hubs ( 𝑃 𝐶 < 0 . 3 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑊 𝑀𝐷 ≥ 0 . 2 ) were observed in the superior frontal gyrus ( SFG ) , orbitofrontal cortex , superior / inferior parietal lobule , insular gyrus ( INS ) , lateral occipital cortex and hip - pocampus ( Fig . 4 A , see also Supplementary Fig . 2A ) . Similarly , most of the connector hubs were located in the fusiform gyrus , hippocampus and thalamus ; the local hubs included the or - bitofrontal cortex , superior temporal gyrus ( STG ) , superior / inferior parietal lobule and lateral occipital cortex in the intermediate condition ( Fig . 4 A , see also Supplementary Fig . 2B ) . In the hard condition , the middle frontal gyrus ( MFG ) , fusiform gyrus , precuneus ( Pcun ) , and thalamus were identiﬁed as the con - nector hubs ; the local hubs were found in the orbitofrontal cor - tex , precentral gyrus , superior / inferior parietal lobule and hippocam - pus ( Fig . 4 A , see also Supplementary Fig . 2C ) .

Finally , we examined the information processing style in PC and WMD using a one - way rmANOVA .

Post - hoc comparisons found that there were signiﬁcant diﬀer - ences in right SFG ( 𝑃 < 0 . 05 , corrected ) and left PrG ( 𝑃 < 0 . 05 , cor - rected ) between easy and intermediate conditions , and there was a sig - niﬁcant diﬀerence in right SFG ( 𝑃 < 0 . 001 , corrected ) between easy and hard condition ( Table 2 ) .

The negative network ( Easy > Hard , abbreviated as E > H ) con - sisted of eight edges ( see Table 3 for details ) comprised the bilateral superior frontal gyrus , bilateral superior parietal lobule , and bilateral paracentral lobule ( PCL ) . Further , no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found in easy versus intermediate or intermediate versus hard . 6 J . Pang , H . Guo , X . Tang et al . NeuroImage 247 ( 2022 ) 118826 Fig . 4 .

Discussion In the present study , we employed a network analysis approach based on beta - series correlation in an event - related design to inves - tigate the interregional functional connectivity of chunk decomposi - tion . The results show that multiple brain systems distributed in tha - lamus , hippocampus , orbitofrontal gyrus , superior and inferior parietal lobe form a global network to accomplish the chunk decomposition process , and nodes in visual system , such as medio ventral occipital cortex , lateral occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus , respond in accor - dance with chunk tightness . Moreover , chunk tightness also leads to increased intermodular connections in superior frontal gyrus and pre - central gyrus . Taken together , we ﬁrst report that chunk decomposition processes integrate information available in a network of dissociable regions . Previous researches based on the functional segregation strategy in chunk decomposition can only detect the activation of brain regions as - sociated with diﬀerent levels of stimulation but not brain regions com - monly involved in the cognitive tasks . To this end , our work makes up for this defect and comprehensively reveals the interregional network of chunk decomposition . Bertolero et al . ( 2018 ) has suggested that con - nector hubs integrate information and subsequently tune their neigh - bors’ connectivity to be more modular , and yet local hubs perform seg - regated processing . We thus propose that the thalamus , as connector hub across diﬀerent conditions of chunk decomposition , relays infor - mation across diﬀerent modular of the brain . Although the thalamus is traditionally regarded as a passive relay station of information from sen - sory organs or subcortical structures to the cortex , it has been recently suggested as an integrative hub ( corresponding to connector hub ) for information processing within the modular functional networks of the brain ( Brandt and Dieterich , 2019 ) . For example , a meta - analysis of the BrainMap database demonstrates that the thalamus is involved in multi - ple cognitive functions , which mediate interactions between high - level cognitive processes ( Hwang et al . , 2017 ) . 7 J .

In contrast to the integrative hub of thalamus , the hippocampus may play an important role in the formation of new associations between problems and solutions in the process of chunk decomposition . The hip - pocampus has been found to form associative relationships between events at a conceptual as well as spatial level ( Sharpe et al . , 2019 ) . In addition , the hippocampus appears to bind elements of a context together to form a holistic spatial representation , which can facilitate action selection regardless of whether these representations are crucial to the current demands of the task ( Matus - Amat et al . , 2004 ; Rudy and Sutherland , 1989 ; Sharpe et al . , 2019 ) . Shen et al . ( 2018 ) has shown that the hippocampus serves critical roles in establishing novel task - related semantic or episodic associations in problem solving . Moreover , the sub - cortical regions , hippocampus and thalamus , were observed as hubs in all conditions , which corroborates that the thalamus and hippocampus are structurally and functionally inter - connected ( Schleifer et al . , 2019 ) . During chunk decomposition , the hippocampus and thalamus play an important role in association and coordination , respectively . The or - bitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) may track the mental representation of chunk decomposition on a moment - to - moment basis . According to a theory related to OFC proposed by Wilson et al . ( 2014 ) , the state of a task com - prises of all relevant information , which would determine the eﬀect of diﬀerent actions on the next state of the task . For example , in a simple Go / No - go task , OFC neurons’ activity change at each phase within a trial ( Schoenbaum and Eichenbaum , 1995 ) , which reﬂects the OFC’s role in directing actions on diﬀerent context . During the course of the chunk decomposition task , the trials with diﬀerent conditions were randomly presented , and the task is relatively novel to participants , consequently , OFC contributes to direct participants to make appropriate decisions in a particular trial . These three discussed brain areas are ﬁrst time reported in the study of chunk decomposition among three conditions , and we also put for - ward a framework to understand the underlying cognitive mechanism . As to posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) , we speculate that the speciﬁc role is mental manipulation the element of chunks in a goal - directed way . Among the obtained brain regions in the study , SPL is mainly in - volved in spatial shifting ( Caspari et al . , 2018 ; Koenigs et al . , 2009 ; Vandenberghe et al . , 2001 ) . Researches have shown that IPL is in - volved in spatial relational processing ( Ackerman and Courtney , 2012 ; Seydell - Greenwald et al . , 2017 ; Zimmermann et al . , 2019 ) . Also , Wendelken ( 2014 ) conducted a meta - analysis on how posterior parietal cortex contributes to reasoning and found that reasoning - related acti - vation concentrated in the IPL . In a word , these ﬁndings in this study 8 J . Pang , H . Guo , X . Tang et al . NeuroImage 247 ( 2022 ) 118826 Table 3 The positive network and negative network were found in chunk decomposition .

The nomenclature of brain regions see in http : / / atlas . brainnetome . org / bnatlas . html . show that these segregative regions as an integrative system performed the chunk decomposition task . Especially , the thalamus relays informa - tion about the execution instructions of the chunk decomposition to both the OFC and the PPC , subsequently allowing these regions to carry out choice behavior under the inﬂuence of the hippocampus . Moreover , hubs’ shift mainly occurred in the visual ﬁeld , and the trend of shift gradually evolved from the primary visual cortex to the high - level visual processing ( Fig . 4 B ) . This phenomenon reﬂects the conversion from perceptual processing to cognitive processing during chunk decomposition when the tightness of chunk increases . The hubs of easy and intermediate conditions in the visual cortex contribute to simple visuospatial processing . Studies have shown that occipital lobe is a primary visual cortex specializing for diﬀerent visual tasks , such as visuospatial processing , motion perception and color discrimination ( Stensaas et al . , 1974 ; Watanabe et al . , 2011 ) . The FuG is a brain region involved in high - level visual processing , speciﬁcally face perception and word recognition ( Allison et al . , 1994 ; Kanwisher et al . , 1997 ) . Further , Luo et al . ( 2006 ) has suggested that the higher visual areas rearrange simple features into a diﬀerent perceptual chunk . As the tightness of Chinese character chunk increases , more eﬀorts are required to decom - pose chunk , which may exceed the visuospatial processing ability of the primary visual cortex . Accordingly , a higher visual area , FuG , is mobi - lized to transform chunk . In addition , FuG as a connector hub in the intermediate and hard conditions would communicate with more brain regions with higher cognition function due to the increasing of tightness of chunk . Furthermore , the modular approach also captured the signiﬁcant dif - ference of information processing style in PC identiﬁed in right superior frontal gyrus and left precentral gyrus . We found that chunk tightness signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced modular segregation and integration in inhibi - tion and lexical , which was mainly contributed by segregation of right SFG and integration of left PrG respectively . This evidence indicates that the brain network modules became more integrated when cognitive task diﬃculty increasing . Hu et al . ( 2016 ) has provided evidence that a spe - ciﬁc role of the right SFG is to the control of impulsive response , namely inhibitory control . Because the intermediate / hard condition is an eﬀort - ful task , the perceptual processing has to be suppressed and transformed into cognitive processing to generate a ﬁnal solution . Lexical processing during unusual input conditions ( real - word lists and syntactic speech ) was found in the PrG ( Friederici et al . , 2000 ; Wang et al . , 2007 ) . As a result , PrG for understanding the meaning of Chinese characters re - cruits multi - module collaborative processing and frequent information integration in the intermediate condition . The functional connectivity between the superior parietal lobule and the left inferior temporal gyrus in the positive network may break up ex - isting chunks into component elements . Studies have shown that left ITG is a possible neural substrate of the putative orthographic lexicon that contains the written forms of words ( Rapcsak and Beeson , 2004 ) and is a specialized region for the processing of written words ( Nobre et al . , 1994 ) . Moreover , the ITG is recruited for demanding feature decisions suggesting that it might be important for the top - down allocation of ef - fort to match current environmental demands ( Davey et al . , 2016 ) . In the present study , the hard condition required participants to remove strokes embedded in Chinese characters rather than radicals , so partici - pants cannot rely on perceptual processing and have to think deeply the spatial relationship between the to - be - removed part and Chinese char - acter from orthographic system . Further , the functional connectivity be - tween SPL and left ITG extracts the to - be - removed strokes in the spatial structure of Chinese character and converts them into new component elements . Of particular interests in the study is a goal - directed subnetwork con - sisting of functional connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex and the superior / inferior parietal lobule , the left middle frontal gyrus , the left precentral gyrus . The discovery that was not captured by the applica - tion of functional segregation is the distinct diﬀerence from the previous research on chunk decomposition with Chinese characters . The multiple regions interconnection of functional integration strategy is ﬁrst intro - duced to chunk decomposition , and naturally we catch the marvelous subnetwork . The MFG is one of the secondary language areas implicated in nuances of language expression such as semantics , grammar , syntax ( Brown et al . , 2006 ; Gohel et al . , 2019 ; Wang et al . , 2008 ) and is promi - nently engaged in the storage of spatial information for language switch - ing ( Leung et al . , 2002 ; Sierpowska et al . , 2018 ) . More importantly , pre - vious evidences have shown that the left hemispheres of those regions play a vital role in semantic cognition ( Gonzalez Alam et al . , 2019 ; Kuo et al . , 2001 ) . Furthermore , Liu and Zhang ( 2000 ) have demon - strated that the essence of mental storage of Chinese characters is the mental representation of the connection between the Chinese character’s orthographic system and its meaning . As we discussed earlier , chunk de - composition in the hard condition requires orthographic checking ( spa - tial relationship ) . Hence , the left MFG and the left PrG may contribute to recall the meaning of the tight Chinese characters causing by ortho - graphic system , that is , chunk decomposition with the tight Chinese characters has also dual structure . As we mentioned above , the OFC can facilitate choice behavior in distinct spaces associated with that particu - lar task ( Sharpe et al . , 2019 ) . Thus , the goal - directed subnetwork mod - ulates the whole positive network to guide mental manipulation . Given the diﬃculty of the tight chunks , we speculate that the goal - directed subnetwork might maintain a highly eﬃcient cognitive state or even an optimal state of cognition to solve problems . In the present study , we have discussed the cognitive pattern and the perceptual / cognitive processing during chunk decomposition . No - tably , one limitation of this study was that participants didn’t generate the key solution for chunk decomposition by themselves rather than decomposed chunk with the help of predeﬁned hints . This approach ensures that participants systematically manipulate information during chunk decomposition , but it also restricts the applicability of the conclu - sions ( Huang et al . , 2015 ) . After all , it is well suited for neuroimaging research especially event - related design , which requires clearly deﬁned the accurate onset times and durations . Although the cognitive function of the brain is sensitive to the external task , these situations may be compensated by strict control of key cognitive components and reliable 9 J . Pang , H . Guo , X . Tang et al . NeuroImage 247 ( 2022 ) 118826 data extraction . Therefore , the conclusions obtained from an externally cued task could partially elucidate the mechanism of spontaneous activ - ity during chunk decomposition . 5 . Conclusions In the study , we extend the cognitive mechanism of chunk decompo - sition from an integrative perspective . The global task - modulated brain network consists of spatially disturbed brain areas including the thala - mus , hippocampus , orbitofrontal cortex , superior and inferior parietal lobule , which forms a framework of chunk decomposition . We propose that the thalamus functions as an integrative hub to relay information across diﬀerent hubs while the orbitofrontal cortex represents the con - current mental states during the course of chunk decomposition . The posterior parietal cortex , including superior and inferior parietal lobule , serves to mentally manipulate the chunking elements in a goal - directed manner and the associations between elements in the question and so - lution phase would be established by the hippocampus . Furthermore , the tightness of chunks is not only associated with diﬀerent processors in visual systems but also leads to increased intermodular connections in right superior frontal gyrus and left precentral gyrus . Taken together , the present study ﬁrst reveals the functional network of chunk decom - position in addition to the tightness - related nodes in the frontal and occipital cortex .
