Given that most health care facilities rely on daily symptom screening as the primary method to identify SARS - CoV - 2 among health care workers , here , we aim to determine how demographic , occupational , and clinical variables influence SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity among health care workers . Methods We designed a cross - sectional survey of HCWs for SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity conducted from May 15th to June 30th 2020 at a 418 - bed academic hospital in Orange County , California . From an eligible population of 5 , 349 HCWs , study participants were recruited in two ways : an open cohort , and a targeted cohort . The open cohort was open to anyone , whereas the targeted cohort that recruited HCWs previously screened for COVID - 19 or work in high - risk units . A total of 1 , 557 HCWs completed the survey and provided specimens , including 1 , 044 in the open cohort and 513 in the targeted cohort . Demographic , occupational , and clinical variables were surveyed electronically . SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity was assessed using a coronavirus antigen microarray ( CoVAM ) , which measures antibodies against eleven viral antigens to identify prior infection with 98 % specificity and 93 % sensitivity . Results Among tested HCWs ( n = 1 , 557 ) , SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity was 10 . 8 % , and risk factors included male gender ( OR 1 . 48 , 95 % CI 1 . 05 – 2 . 06 ) , exposure to COVID - 19 outside of work ( 2 . 29 , 1 . 14 – 4 . 29 ) , working in food or environmental services ( 4 . 85 , 1 . 51 – 14 . 85 ) , and working in COVID - 19 units ( ICU : 2 . 28 , 1 . 29 – 3 . 96 ; ward : 1 . 59 , 1 . 01 – 2 . 48 ) . Amongst 1 , 103 HCWs not previously screened , seropositivity was 8 . 0 % , and additional risk factors included younger age ( 1 . 57 , 1 . 00 - 2 . 45 ) and working in administration ( 2 . 69 , 1 . 10 – 7 . 10 ) .

BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 330 Background Protecting health care workers ( HCWs ) during the coro - navirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic is essential to mounting an effective response , as outbreaks among this population could potentially cripple health care delivery . Current case identification relies on symptom and temperature screening with follow - up testing by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) quantitative reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) . This approach underestimates disease prevalence by missing cases of asymptomatic infection and false negatives due to suboptimal timing , flawed specimen collection , or low viral load [ 1 , 2 ] . Given the importance of asymptomatic persons in the trans - mission of SARS - CoV - 2 , estimated to account for 59 % of overall transmission , including 24 % from asymptom - atic persons and 35 % from pre - symptomatic persons [ 3 ] , identification of risk factors that may augment identifi - cation of asymptomatic infection in HCWs is crucial to protecting patients and the health care system [ 1 ] . Serologic testing can help to determine the true preva - lence of COVID - 19 by identifying previously infected persons who had minimal symptoms so were missed by the current testing paradigm [ 4 , 5 ] . Multiple COVID - 19 seroprevalence studies have been performed in differ - ent populations but are limited by low specificity in low - prevalence populations or potential selection bias from the use of convenience sampling , with estimated serop - revalence of comparable populations during the study period ranging from 1 . 0 to 11 . 2 % [ 6 – 11 ] . Estimated sero - prevalence among HCW varies widely , with some stud - ies finding similar or even lower prevalence compared to the surrounding community , but most studies noting a significant proportion of asymptomatic infections [ 8 , 12 – 18 ] . Risk factors for SARS - CoV - 2 infection amongst HCW were initially extrapolated from studies of hospitalized patients with severe disease that may not be generaliz - able to the population at large [ 19 ] . Previous studies to identify risk factors amongst HCWs were performed in early outbreak setting prior to current infection con - trol practices so may not be currently applicable [ 20 , 21 ] . More recent studies have conflicting results as to whether occupational exposures confer an increased risk of SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity and may be limited by sub - optimal performance of the assays upon external valida - tion , heterogeneity in the study populations , and lack of control for confounding due to the use of univariate anal - yses [ 22 – 25 ] . This study measured SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity amongst 1 , 557 HCWs at the University of California - Irvine Health , a 418 - bed academic medical center in Orange County , California , from May 15th to June 30th 2020 , using a novel coronavirus antigen microarray ( CoVAM ) . This CoVAM utilizes 11 SARS - CoV - 2 IgG and IgM antigens to determine prior infection with 98 % specificity and 93 % sensitivity based on validation in 91 rt - PCR - positive cases and 88 pre - pandemic negative controls . The CoVAM also is used to distinguish SARS _ CoV - 2 infection from prior infection with other human coronaviruses [ 26 ] . This performance and level of valida - tion compares favorably to other serologic assays based on a single antigen [ 27 , 28 ] , and the predictive model based on multiple antigens outperformed models based on any single antigen during validation of the COVAM [ 26 ] . A multivariable analysis was used to probe associa - tions among demographic , clinical , and occupational risk factors and SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity among HCWs . Methods Study design , setting , and population The study , a prospective cohort study , with the first time point presented here as a cross - sectional analy - sis , was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California - Irvine under Protocol HS 2020 – 5818 . All 5 , 349 employees who worked in the hos - pital were eligible . Universal daily symptom and tem - perature screening was initiated on April 14 , 2020 , with subsequent immediate rt - PCR testing for any HCW with symptoms or fever or disclosure of a confirmed or sus - pected COVID - 19 contact . A primary study site in the main hospital building of University of California Irvine Health ( Orange , California , USA ) was open from May 15 to May 29 , 2020 to all employees who provided elec - tronic consent ( open enrollment cohort ) . In addition , all employees who had been tested for SARS - CoV - 2 by rt - PCR at the primary study site due to symptoms or pos - sible exposure , or who provided direct patient care in COVID - 19 clinical units or similar control units , were invited via email and provided electronic consent to participate at a secondary study open from May 15 to June 30 , 2020 ( targeted enrollment cohort ) . This second cohort was included to enrich the study for HCW with COVID - 19 infection , symptoms , or exposure . Conclusion SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity is significantly higher than reported case counts even among HCWs who are meticulously screened . Seropositive HCWs missed by screening were more likely to be younger , work outside direct patient care , or have exposure outside of work .

BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 330 Study procedures Participants were given a unique study identifier and a mobile phone link to a Research Electronic Data Cap - ture ( REDCap , Vanderbilt University , Nashville , TN ) survey to collect data on demographic , clinical , and occupational risk factors ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . At the primary study site , participants then underwent capil - lary blood collection via fingerstick using a disposable lancet into microfuge capillary tubes ( BD Microtainer ) . After centrifugation at 1500 x g for 10 min , supernatant plasma was collected , frozen , and transported for labora - tory analysis ( for testing for SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies on the CoVAM ) . At the secondary study site , participants underwent phlebotomy into gold - top tubes ( BD Bio - sciences , San Jose , CA ) for centrifugation and collec - tion of serum , from which an aliquot was frozen at 0 C° and transported for laboratory analysis ( for testing for SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies on the CoVAM ) . All specimens were labeled with unique identifiers accessible only via a secure key . Laboratory assay The CoVAM includes 67 antigens from respiratory viruses , including 11 antigens from SARS - CoV - 2 ( Sino Biological U . S . Inc . , Wayne , PA ) . Antigens were printed onto microarrays in quadruplicate , probed with serum specimens and secondary antibodies for IgM and IgG , and imaged to determine background - subtracted median fluorescence intensity [ 29 – 31 ] . Briefly , CoVAM data for each specimen were compared with 91 rt - PCR - positive cases with blood collected ≥ 7 days ( range 7 – 50 , median 11 ) post - symptom onset and 88 pre - pandemic controls with blood collected prior to November 1 , 2019 , which were split randomly into 70 % training set and 30 % testing set for model development . Based on IgM and IgG anti - bodies against the 11 SARS - CoV - 2 antigens on the array , a logistic regression model was trained on positive and negative controls in the training set to determine optimal weighted combinations of reactive antigens to calculate composite SARS - CoV - 2 antibody titers that discrimi - nate the two groups , with reactivity thresholds selected to achieve maximum sensitivity while maintaining ≥ 98 % specificity . The model was tested on the testing set and achieved 92 . 7 % sensitivity and 97 . 7 % specificity for detecting prior SARS - CoV - 2 infection based on compos - ite IgM or IgG positivity [ 26 ] . A detailed description of the development and validation of the CoVAM has been previously published [ 26 ] . Statistical analysis The prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity was calcu - lated in the study population as the proportion of HCWs who were classified as seropositive , and the prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity was calculated within categories of each demographic , clinical and occupa - tional risk factor and compared to the study population by expressing as odds ratio ( OR ) with 95 % confidence interval . In order to assess the associations between clini - cal and occupational risk factors and seropositivity , mul - tivariable logistic regression models were constructed to control for potential confounding due to demographic and health - related factors associated with both occupa - tional exposure and underlying risk for seropositivity ; potential covariates were chosen by the authors based on known association with COVID - 19 epidemiology and relevance to occupational health . We included in the model demographic variables ( age , gender , and race / eth - nicity ) and health - related covariates ( asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , diabetes mellitus , hyper - tension , self - reported smoking or vaping ) which have known associations with COVID - 19 epidemiology [ 32 ] , in addition to known COVID - 19 exposure outside of work and occupation - related variables of interest ( self - reported role , location , and contact with COVID - 19 patients ) . A targeted cohort was included in addition to the open cohort in order to gain data on healthcare workers who may be more prone to exposure - those in high - risk areas ( e . g . ICU healthcare workers ) , a particu - lar interest to this study . Health - and occupation - related exposures were selected based on bivariate associations with seropositivity using a p < 0 . 1 criterion for inclusion and added to the model in a forward stepwise regres - sion . The final model for clinical and occupational risk factors was adjusted for age ( quartiles ) , gender , race / eth - nicity ( Asian , White , Latino , Black , and Mixed / other / not reported ) , known COVID - 19 exposure outside of work , and workplace role , location , and COVID - 19 patient con - tact . Adjusted analyses were conducted among the entire sample and the same model was applied to the subgroup of HCWs not tested previously via rt - PCR . Model fit was evaluated using the Hosmer - Lemeshow goodness - of - fit test and C - statistic . All analyses were conducted using R software v4 . 0 . 3 ( R Consortium for Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) . Results SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity in the study population From an eligible population of 5 , 349 HCWs , 1 , 841 ( 34 . 4 % ) consented to participate , including 1 , 108 in the open enrollment cohort and 733 in the targeted enroll - ment cohort . Of the targeted cohort , 343 had been tested by rt - PCR for COVID - 19 , 237 worked in a COVID - 19 unit and 153 worked in a matched control unit of similar acuity . A total of 1 , 557 HCWs completed the survey and provided blood specimens to be analyzed by CoVAM , including 1 , 044 in the open enrollment cohort and 513 in the targeted cohort . Page 4 of 11 Schubl et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 330 SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity was 10 . 8 % in the overall HCW cohort ( Table 1 ) . Seropositivity was 17 . 7 % amongst the 419 HCWs who had been tested by rt - PCR previously , and 8 . 0 % among the 1 , 138 HCW who had not . Seroposi - tivity in the targeted versus open enrollment cohorts matched closely the seropositivity among HCWs tested previously versus not tested by rt - PCR respectively . Of the 413 HCW tested by rt - PCR , results were available for 360 HCWs , among these 38 were PCR + and 322 PCR - , with 36 ( 94 . 7 % ) of the PCR + testing seropositive whereas 30 ( 9 . 3 % ) of the PCR - were seropositive , higher than the 8 . 0 % seropositivity rate of those not tested by rt - PCR ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Potential demographic risk factors identified by bivari - ate analysis included age , gender , race / ethnicity , and co - morbid conditions , as well as confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 Table 1 Association between demographic and health - related characteristics and SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity of HCW study population and subgroups All HCWs ( n = 1 , 557 ) Not tested by rt - PCR ( n = 1 , 138 ) Tested by rt - PCR ( n = 419 ) HCWs , n ( % ) COVID - 19 AB preva - lence , n ( % ) OR ( 95 % CI ) 1 HCWs , n ( % ) COVID - 19 AB preva - lence , n ( % ) OR ( 95 % CI ) 1 HCWs , n ( % ) COVID - 19 AB preva - lence , n ( % ) OR ( 95 % CI ) 1 Total 1557 ( 100 ) 165 ( 10 . 6 ) 1138 ( 100 ) 91 ( 8 . 0 ) 419 ( 100 ) 74 ( 17 . 7 ) Age quartiles ( y ) 18 – 31 418 ( 26 . 8 ) 49 ( 11 . 7 ) 1 . 17 ( 0 . 82 – 1 . 66 ) 311 ( 27 . 3 ) 33 ( 10 . 6 ) 1 . 57 ( 1 . 00 - 2 . 45 ) 107 ( 25 . 5 ) 16 ( 15 . 0 ) 0 . 77 ( 0 . 41 – 1 . 38 ) 32 – 38 382 ( 24 . 5 ) 41 ( 10 . 7 ) 1 . 02 ( 0 . 69 – 1 . 47 ) 257 ( 22 . 6 ) 22 ( 8 . 6 ) 1 . 10 ( 0 . 65 – 1 . 79 ) 125 ( 29 . 8 ) 19 ( 15 . 2 ) 0 . 78 ( 0 . 43 – 1 . 36 ) 39 – 43 377 ( 24 . 2 ) 35 ( 9 . 3 ) 0 . 83 ( 0 . 55 – 1 . 21 ) 275 ( 24 . 2 ) 15 ( 5 . 5 ) 0 . 60 ( 0 . 33 – 1 . 03 ) 102 ( 24 . 3 ) 20 ( 19 . 6 ) 1 . 19 ( 0 . 66 – 2 . 07 ) 49 – 73 380 ( 24 . 4 ) 40 ( 10 . 5 ) 0 . 99 ( 0 . 67 – 1 . 43 ) 295 ( 25 . 9 ) 21 ( 7 . 1 ) 0 . 85 ( 0 . 50 – 1 . 38 ) 85 ( 20 . 3 ) 19 ( 22 . 4 ) 1 . 46 ( 0 . 80 – 2 . 59 ) Gender Female 1073 ( 68 . 9 ) 100 ( 9 . 3 ) 0 . 66 ( 0 . 48 – 0 . 93 ) 781 ( 68 . 6 ) 57 ( 7 . 3 ) 0 . 75 ( 0 . 48 – 1 . 18 ) 292 ( 69 . 7 ) 43 ( 14 . 7 ) 0 . 53 ( 0 . 32 – 0 . 90 ) Male 482 ( 31 . 0 ) 64 ( 13 . 3 ) 1 . 48 ( 1 . 05 – 2 . 06 ) 355 ( 31 . 2 ) 33 ( 9 . 3 ) 1 . 28 ( 0 . 81 – 1 . 99 ) 127 ( 30 . 3 ) 31 ( 24 . 4 ) 1 . 87 ( 1 . 11 – 3 . 13 ) Other 2 2 ( 0 . 1 ) 1 ( 50 . 0 ) - 2 ( 0 . 2 ) 1 ( 50 . 0 ) - 0 ( 0 ) - - Race / Ethnicity Asian 608 ( 39 . 0 ) 70 ( 11 . 5 ) 1 . 17 ( 0 . 84 – 1 . 62 ) 415 ( 36 . 5 ) 26 ( 6 . 3 ) 0 . 68 ( 0 . 42 – 1 . 07 ) 193 ( 46 . 1 ) 44 ( 22 . 8 ) 1 . 93 ( 1 . 16 – 3 . 24 ) White 457 ( 29 . 4 ) 46 ( 10 . 1 ) 0 . 92 ( 0 . 64 – 1 . 31 ) 336 ( 29 . 5 ) 32 ( 9 . 5 ) 1 . 33 ( 0 . 84 – 2 . 07 ) 121 ( 28 . 9 ) 14 ( 11 . 6 ) 0 . 52 ( 0 . 27 – 0 . 94 ) Latino 286 ( 18 . 4 ) 27 ( 9 . 4 ) 0 . 86 ( 0 . 54 – 1 . 30 ) 232 ( 20 . 4 ) 18 ( 7 . 8 ) 0 . 96 ( 0 . 55 – 1 . 61 ) 54 ( 12 . 9 ) 9 ( 16 . 7 ) 0 . 92 ( 0 . 41 – 1 . 90 ) Black 29 ( 1 . 9 ) 3 ( 10 . 3 ) 0 . 97 ( 0 . 23 – 2 . 80 ) 25 ( 2 . 2 ) 2 ( 8 . 0 ) 1 . 00 ( 0 . 16 – 3 . 46 ) 4 ( 1 . 0 ) 1 ( 25 . 0 ) 1 . 56 ( 0 . 08 – 12 . 39 ) Mixed / Other / Not reported 177 ( 11 . 4 ) 19 ( 10 . 7 ) 1 . 02 ( 0 . 60 – 1 . 65 ) 130 ( 11 . 4 ) 13 ( 10 . 0 ) 1 . 32 ( 0 . 68 – 2 . 38 ) 47 ( 11 . 2 ) 6 ( 12 . 8 ) 0 . 65 ( 0 . 24 – 1 . 50 ) Comorbidities Any comorbidities 370 ( 23 . 8 ) 41 ( 11 . 1 ) 1 . 07 ( 0 . 73 – 1 . 54 ) 258 ( 22 . 7 ) 18 ( 7 . 0 ) 0 . 83 ( 0 . 47 – 1 . 39 ) 112 ( 26 . 7 ) 23 ( 20 . 5 ) 1 . 30 ( 0 . 74 – 2 . 22 ) Asthma or COPD 155 ( 10 . 0 ) 16 ( 10 . 3 ) 0 . 97 ( 0 . 54 – 1 . 62 ) 114 ( 10 . 0 ) 9 ( 7 . 9 ) 0 . 98 ( 0 . 45 – 1 . 92 ) 41 ( 9 . 8 ) 7 ( 17 . 1 ) 0 . 96 ( 0 . 38 – 2 . 13 ) Diabetes mellitus 67 ( 4 . 3 ) 10 ( 14 . 9 ) 1 . 51 ( 0 . 71 – 2 . 89 ) 45 ( 4 . 0 ) 3 ( 6 . 7 ) 0 . 82 ( 0 . 19 – 2 . 30 ) 22 ( 5 . 3 ) 7 ( 31 . 8 ) 2 . 30 ( 0 . 85 – 5 . 68 ) Hypertension 172 ( 11 . 0 ) 18 ( 10 . 5 ) 0 . 98 ( 0 . 57 – 1 . 61 ) 118 ( 10 . 4 ) 5 ( 4 . 2 ) 0 . 48 ( 0 . 17 – 1 . 10 ) 54 ( 12 . 9 ) 13 ( 24 . 1 ) 1 . 58 ( 0 . 77 – 3 . 06 ) Smoking or vaping 37 ( 2 . 4 ) 4 ( 10 . 8 ) 1 . 02 ( 0 . 30 – 2 . 61 ) 24 ( 2 . 1 ) 2 ( 8 . 3 ) 1 . 05 ( 0 . 17 – 3 . 63 ) 13 ( 3 . 1 ) 2 ( 15 . 4 ) 0 . 84 ( 0 . 13 – 3 . 23 ) COVID - 19 ex - posure outside of work 58 ( 3 . 7 ) 12 ( 20 . 7 ) 2 . 29 ( 1 . 14 – 4 . 29 ) 28 ( 2 . 5 ) 5 ( 17 . 9 ) 2 . 59 ( 0 . 85 – 6 . 47 ) 30 ( 7 . 2 ) 7 ( 23 . 3 ) 1 . 46 ( 0 . 56 – 3 . 39 ) 1 Odds ratios ( OR ) are unadjusted , comparing the selected group to the entire HCW population 2 OR for Other gender omitted due to small sample size ( n < 5 ) Ab : antibody , HCW : health care worker , CI : confidence interval , rt - PCR : reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction , COPD : chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Page 5 of 11 Schubl et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 330 exposure outside the hospital ( Table 1 ) . No significant effect of age was noted among HCWs overall ; however , a non - significant increase in seropositivity was observed for younger HCWs who were not previously tested by rt - PCR . Male gender was associated with increased sero - positivity , whereas race / ethnicity and co - morbidities were not . Confirmed COVID - 19 exposure outside the hospital was the most significant demographic risk factor for seropositivity . Impact of occupational risk factors on SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity The multivariate model included the non - occupational covariates discussed above , in addition to role and location within the hospital ( Table 2 ) . The Hosmer - Lemeshow goodness - of - fit test was non - significant ( p = 0 . 55 ) and area under the receiver - operating char - acteristic curve showed moderate discriminant ability ( C - statistic = 0 . 62 ) . Among roles within the hospital , only HCWs work - ing in food services or environmental services showed significantly increased seropositivity ( OR 4 . 85 ) as com - pared to the overall HCW population , and the effect was restricted to those not tested by rt - PCR . Similarly , working in administration was associated with increased seropositivity ( OR 2 . 69 ) only amongst HCWs not tested by rt - PCR . Among locations in the hospital , working in COVID - 19 units was associated with increased seroposi - tivity ( OR 2 . 28 for ICU , 1 . 59 for ward ) , whereas working in labor and delivery units was associated with decreased seropositivity ( OR 0 . 24 ) . COVID - 19 patient contact and participation in aerosol - generating procedures on these patients were not associated with seropositivity ( OR 0 . 70 ) . Correlation of COVID - 19 symptoms with seropositivity A separate multivariable model was constructed that included non - occupational covariates discussed above , in addition to symptoms of COVID - 19 , but not includ - ing occupational covariates ( Table 3 ) . Overall , multiple symptoms , specifically fatigue ( OR 1 . 77 ) , myalgias ( OR 1 . 76 ) , fever ( OR 1 . 67 ) , chills ( OR 1 . 79 ) , and anosmia were associated with increased seropositivity , with the strongest association observed for anosmia ( OR 5 . 34 ) . No association between symptoms and seropositivity was observed for HCW who were not previously tested by rt - PCR ( i . e . not previously identified by occupational screening ) . Discussion This study provides several insights into the relationships between non - occupational and occupational risk factors and COVID - 19 seropositivity among HCWs ( Fig . 1 ) . The study hospital was able to maintain infection prevention best practices consistent with guidance from the U . S . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , including continuous , ample availability of PPE through - out the pandemic , which is relevant to the question of whether these measures fully prevent in - hospital trans - mission of SARS - CoV - 2 . Exposure to COVID - 19 outside of work was a greater risk factor for seropositivity than any occupational exposure other than working in food or environmental services . The HCW roles associated with the greatest odds of seropositivity did not involve direct patient care . Nurses , who have the most direct and sus - tained patient contact , were not at significantly increased odds . The only locations associated with increased sero - positivity were the dedicated COVID - 19 ICU and floor units . The operating room , an area of great concern due to intubation of multiple patients , was not associ - ated with increased risk . Performing aerosol - generating procedures on known COVID - 19 patients was also not significantly associated with seropositivity , which is reas - suring given that perceived risk of transmission during these procedures can delay patient care . Stratification of HCWs based on whether or not they were tested previously by rt - PCR yielded several addi - tional insights into the strengths and weaknesses of universal symptom screening . The study hospital was conducting universal symptom screening of all HCWs during the study period , and HCW who screened posi - tive were captured in the subgroup tested by rt - PCR ; those HCW who did not screen positive for symptoms and were not tested by rt - PCR but were found to be sero - positive likely reflect asymptomatic infections or lack of reporting of symptoms . Although the hospital’s man - datory occupational health screening was only imple - mented one month prior to this study , relatively few COVID - 19 infections would have occurred prior to this screening based on the local prevalence of COVID - 19 ( Fig . 2 ) . The association between COVID - 19 symptoms and seropositivity was restricted to HCW tested previ - ously by rt - PCR , indicating that universal screening was effective in identifying symptomatic infections among the HCW in the study population . Younger HCWs who were COVID - 19 - seropositive were more likely to be missed by occupational screening , which is consistent with the increased prevalence of minimally symptomatic infection among younger individuals [ 33 ] . Decreased seropositivity among HCW in labor and delivery units may be due to increased vigilance amongst HCW who care for pregnant patients or low disease prevalence among these patients . Exposure to COVID - 19 outside of work was associated with increased odds of seropositivity among HCWs not previously tested by rt - PCR , indicating that these expo - sures were not being universally reported during screen - ing as they should have prompted rt - PCR testing .

The overall seropositivity rate was 10 . 8 % in this study , but the 8 . 0 % seropositivity amongst HCW not previously identified by screening , which matches the seropositivity in the open enrollment cohort , is most appropriate for comparison to com - munity prevalence to avoid the enrichment effect of the targeted enrollment cohort .

This large discrepancy is likely explained in part by the waning of PCR positivity over time , as viral shed - ding is short - term whereas seropositivity is relatively sustained . Whereas more recent seroprevalence stud - ies show a lower increase compared to case counts , our result is most comparable to early seroprevalence stud - ies prior to significant local outbreaks of COVID - 19 that have found larger disparities between seropositivity rates and case counts [ 6 – 10 , 16 ] . Subsequently , a community study sampled 2 , 979 random participants in Orange County from July 10 through August 16 , 2020 and found a seropositivity rate of 11 . 5 % ( 95 % CI : 10 . 5 – 12 . 4 % ) using an updated version of the CoVAM with a more stringent threshold for seropositivity [ 34 ] . The seroprevalence esti - mates imply that HCWs have SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity similar to the surrounding community ( although sero - positivity in both studies is much higher than prevalence based on public health case reporting confirmed by rt - PCR testing ) , with the caveat that the two studies were performed during different time periods . The findings of this study are largely consistent with recently published studies of SARS - CoV - 2 seroposi - tivity among HCWs [ 22 – 25 ] . In particular , the lack of association of either race / ethnicity or co - morbidities with seropositivity in our study is consistent with these prior HCW studies and differs from a prior community study that did observe such associations [ 35 ] . This study provides additional insight compared to prior studies by examining specific roles in the hospital and controlling for multiple likely sources of confounding . For example , nurses had significantly elevated seropositivity in bivari - ate analyses ( unadjusted OR [ CI ] = 1 . 52 [ 1 . 10 – 2 . 10 ] ) but this finding did not persist after adjusting for work loca - tion ; in contrast , null associations between seropositivity and roles without direct patient care became significant and positive after adjusting for location ( unadjusted OR [ CI ] for administrative = 1 . 08 [ 0 . 66 , 1 . 69 ] ; food / environ - mental = 1 . 54 [ 0 . 62 – 3 . 29 ] ) . Strengths of this study include the validated test per - formance of the CoVAM , which compares favorably to currently available single - antigen assays ; the large sample size with inclusion of 34 . 4 % of HCW at the hospital ; and the use of multivariable analysis to control for confound - ing . The weaknesses of this study include the non - ran - dom enrollment methodology as the targeted enrollment cohort was invited from groups expected to have higher Fig . 2 Epidemiologic context of HCW study with respect to community prevalence and hospital burden of COVID - 19 . This study was performed be - tween May 15th to June 30th , 2020 ( top graph ) , a period in which total cases in Orange County were on a rise ( bottom graph ) . Key events for the Univer - sity Hospital system are outlined in the bottom Page 9 of 11 Schubl et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 330 seroprevalence and the open enrollment cohort was sub - ject to self - selection , which both could lead to sampling bias . Also , different blood sampling methodology was used in the open and targeted enrollment cohorts due to institutional interest in banking specimens from the lat - ter group . The subgroup analysis based on prior rt - PCR testing was used to control for the heterogeneous sam - pling , as prior testing was the primary driver of increased prevalence in the targeted enrollment cohort . When the study population is stratified based on method of recruit - ment ( Supplementary Tables 1 – 3 and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , the results are largely similar to stratification based on rt - PCR testing ( Tables 1 , 2 and 3 ; Fig . 1 ) . Conclusion The results of this study have several implications for the local and global responses to the COVID - 19 pandemic . The finding of a significantly increased SARS - CoV - 2 prevalence by serology as compared with rt - PCR pro - vides evidence that the reported counts of confirmed COVID - 19 cases are significant underestimates . The observations that HCWs who are younger , work in non - patient care roles , or have COVID - 19 exposure outside of work are more likely to have COVID - 19 seropositivity without prior testing indicates that screening and vacci - nation efforts targeting these groups can be particularly effective . While we do not observe an association of aero - sol - generating procedures with SARS - CoV - 2 seropositiv - ity in the context of adequate availability and presumably appropriate use of PPE , we do observe increased sero - positivity in COVID - 19 units , but this may potentially be related to geographical factors other than patient care given that caring for COVID - 19 patients was not a sig - nificant risk factor . Further studies are needed to confirm these observations . Of note , this study was performed prior to the avail - ability of vaccines against SARS - CoV - 2 , which is now required for workers in most healthcare facilities . While these early pandemic observations are therefore less rel - evant to the current epidemiology of the COVID - 19 pan - demic in healthcare facilities , they can be used to inform the hospital epidemiology response to future epidemics of viral respiratory infections .
