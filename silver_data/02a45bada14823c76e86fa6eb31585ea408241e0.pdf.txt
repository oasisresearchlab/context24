Methods At least 1000 people were followed up with phone calls or self‑report in a mobile application within 7 days after vaccination . Local and systemic reactogenicities were reported overall and by subgroups . Results The presence of one or more local and systemic adverse effects after the first dose of vaccines was 58 . 9 % [ ( 95 % Confidence Intervals ) : 57 . 5 – 60 . 3 ) ] and 60 . 5 % ( 59 . 1 – 61 . 9 ) , respectively . These rates were reduced to 53 . 8 % ( 51 . 2 – 55 . 0 ) and 50 . 8 % ( 48 . 8 – 52 . 7 ) for the second dose . The most common local adverse effect reported for all vaccines was pain in the injection site . During the first week after the first dose of vaccines , the frequency of the pain for Sinopharm , AZD1222 , Sputnik V , and Barekat was 35 . 5 % , 86 . 0 % , 77 . 6 % , and 30 . 9 % , respectively . The same rates after the second dose were 27 . 3 % , 66 . 5 % , 63 . 9 % , and 49 . 0 % . The most common systemic adverse effect was fatigue . In the first dose , it was 30 . 3 % for Sinopharm , 67 . 4 % for AZD1222 , 47 . 6 % for Sputnik V , and 17 . 1 % for Barekat . These rates were reduced to 24 . 6 % , 37 . 1 % , 36 . 5 % , and 19 . 5 % , in the second dose of vaccines . AZD1222 had the highest local and systemic adverse effects rates . The odds ratio of local adverse effects of the AZD1222 vaccine compared to the Sinopharm vaccine were 8 . 73 ( 95 % CI 6 . 93 – 10 . 99 ) in the first dose and 4 . 14 ( 95 % CI 3 . 32 – 5 . 17 ) in the second dose . Barekat and Sinopharm had the lowest frequency of local and systemic adverse effects . Compared to Sinopharm , systemic adverse effects were lower after the first dose of Barekat ( OR = 0 . 56 ; 95 % CI 0 . 46 – 0 . 67 ) . Reactogenicity events were higher in women and younger people . Prior COVID‑19 infection increased the odds of adverse effects only after the first dose of vaccines . * Correspondence : Mohammad Hassan Emamian emamian @ shmu . ac . ir Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 15 Enayatrad et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 150 Conclusions Pain and fatigue were the most common reactogenicities of COVID‑19 vaccination . Reactogenicities were less common after the second dose of the vaccines . The adverse effects of AZD1222 were greater than those of other vaccines . Keywords Vaccine reactogenicity , Sinopharm , Sputnik V , AZD1222 , COVIran Barekat Background The COVID - 19 pandemic has caused significant mor - tality and morbidity worldwide , and until now , vaccina - tion has been the most effective and promising strategy to control the spread of this disease [ 1 , 2 ] . More than 250 vaccine production projects for COVID - 19 have been launched worldwide since 2020 [ 3 ] . According to a recent World Health Organization ( WHO ) report , 176 vaccines are in clinical , and 199 vaccines are in the preclinical development phases . However , at least 27 vaccines have been clinically used or approved against SARS - CoV - 2 [ 4 ] and as of 12 January 2022 , nine vaccines have been authorized for emergency use by WHO [ 5 ] . The most common adverse effects of the vaccines include pain , swelling , redness at the injection site and fever , chills , headache , myalgia , fatigue , nausea , and joint pain as systemic adverse effects [ 6 ] . These reac - togenicity events usually last 12 h to less than 7 days ; in rare cases , they continue up to a month after vac - cination [ 7 , 8 ] . The local and systemic adverse effects are common but usually mild and self - limiting . Most of these reactions should resolve within a few days [ 9 , 10 ] . However , they may be dangerous and cause fear in some cases . Besides , concerns about the adverse effects of COVID - 19 vaccines may influence people’s decision to accept or reject the vaccine [ 11 , 12 ] . COVID - 19 vaccination was performed based on age groups from older to younger and prioritized high - risk groups . Many countries have commenced their vaccination program , prioritizing those most at risk due to the limited number of available vaccines [ 7 ] . In Iran , COVID - 19 vac - cination was started for high - risk groups , with Sinopharm , Sputnik V , AZD1222 , and COVIran Barekat vaccines in high - risk groups and rolled out to other population groups . It is essential to determine the adverse effects of new COVID - 19 vaccines . The WHO has developed guide - lines [ 13 ] for safety signal detection after vaccination and recommended it in a different setting . This study was performed based on this protocol and aimed to investigate the local and systemic adverse effects in an Iranian group of vaccinated individuals . Methods Study design and participant This prospective observational study evaluated the reactogenicity adverse effects of COVID - 19 vaccines , including Sinopharm ( inactivated vaccine ) , Sputnik V ( a human adenovirus vector - based vaccine ) , AZD1222 ( a chimpanzee adenovirus vector - based vaccine ) , and COVIran Barekat ( Inactivated vaccine ) , based on WHO protocol [ 13 ] . This study was performed in seven cities in Iran ( Shahroud , Rasht , Zahedan , Sanandaj , Birjand , Ker - man , and Mashhad ) and its protocol has been published previously [ 14 ] . The study population included all eligi - ble individuals who received one of the different types of COVID - 19 vaccine according to the Iranian guidelines for COVID - 19 vaccination . Signing the written informed consent by people vaccinated with the first dose of COVID - 19 vaccines at one of the vaccination centers participating in the study was considered as inclusion cri - teria . Exclusion criteria were included : individuals who were already vaccinated with any COVID - 19 vaccines before study enrolment , and unable to comply with study procedures . Participants had the right to withdraw from the study for any reason at any time . The necessary information , including contact infor - mation , demographic characteristics , and history of underlying diseases ( diabetes , hypertension , immunode - ficiency , cancer , chronic heart disease , and respiratory , renal , hepatic , neurological , and psychiatric diseases ) were collected during enrolment . Also , all the details of the injected vaccine , including the vaccine brand , vac - cination date , and the vaccine’s batch number , were recorded in the designed registration system . Weight and height were also self - reported , and obesity was defined as a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) equal to or more than 30 kg / m 2 . Data collection This study used telephone calls and electronic methods ( mobile application and web pages ) to collect data for at least 1000 participants of each vaccine . The local and sys - temic reactions after vaccination were recorded on days 1 to 7 after each dose of the vaccine . A reminder SMS was sent if the participants did not report the adverse effect data to the application by 16 : 00 . If the data were not entered after the SMS , the trained experts actively followed and recorded the occurrence of adverse effects using telephone calls . For participants who were reluc - tant to use the web application , all data were collected by daily phone calls . Participants could also enter free Page 3 of 15 Enayatrad et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 150 textual reports about their post - vaccination experience and adverse events . In order to minimize loss to follow - up rate , the participants were contacted by phone up to twice a day . If they could not be reached , their next kin was followed up , and finally , if none of these worked , the call of that day was recorded as missed . A participant was considered lost to follow up after two unsuccess - ful attempts to contact them by phone , followed by one unsuccessful attempt to contact their next of kin . Outcomes The main objective of this study was to estimate the reac - togenicity within 7 days after each COVID - 19 vaccine dose , and the primary outcome was the proportion of individuals who reported local or systemic adverse effects within 7 days of the first and second vaccine doses . The local and systemic reactogenicities included pain at the injection site , redness , swelling , induration , warmness , itching , fever , nausea , malaise , chills , headache , joint pain , myalgia , and fatigue . The severity of reactogenici - ties was also assessed for every reaction by asking about the extent to which adverse effects interfere with the par - ticipant’s daily activities . Statistical analysis The proportion of systemic and local adverse effects within 7 days of vaccination was calculated and reported with 95 % confidence intervals . Observed - to - expected analyses were performed for systemic reactogenici - ties using the collected data for the 3 days before vac - cination . The duration ( in days ) was calculated for each type of event and their mean and standard deviation were reported . Separate logistic regression models were conducted for each vaccine dose to calculate and com - pare the odds ratio ( OR ) of local and systemic adverse effects while adjusting for age , sex , BMI , comorbidities and prior COVID - 19 disease . The significance level was considered ≤ 0 . 05 . Results Out of 4639 people who received the first dose of vac - cines from April 7 , 2021 , to January 11 , 2022 , 2908 ( 62 . 7 % ) received the second dose . The participants com - pleted follow up in 7 days after vaccination with each dose of vaccines . The mean age of those who received the first dose was 46 . 7 ( Standard Deviation [ SD ] : 18 . 5 ) years . The age and sex distribution of participants is provided in Table 1 . Participants in the Sinopharm and Barekat groups had higher mean ages than other vaccine groups . The mean BMI of participants was 25 . 5 ( SD : 4 . 3 ) , which was higher in those receiving the Barekat [ 26 . 6 ( SD : 4 . 2 ) ] compared to participants receiving other vaccines ( Table 1 ) . Considering that the enrolment was started with high - risk groups and those with a history of underlying dis - eases , the prevalence of underlying diseases was high in participants with 62 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 61 . 2 – 64 . 0 ) having a his - tory of underlying diseases . Among first - dose recipients , 58 . 9 % ( 95 % CI 57 . 5 – 60 . 3 ) had one or more local adverse effects , and 60 . 5 % ( 95 % CI 59 . 1 – 61 . 9 ) had one or more systemic adverse effects . Among second - dose recipients , 53 . 1 % ( 95 % CI 51 . 2 – 55 . 0 ) had one or more local adverse effects , and 50 . 8 % ( 95 % CI 48 . 8 – 52 . 7 ) had one or more systemic adverse effects . The frequency of one or more local and systemic adverse effects was also highest in the first dose of the AZD1222 vaccine . Except for local adverse effects in Barekat recipi - ents , the frequency of local and systemic adverse effects was lower after the second dose of vaccines compared to the first dose ( Table 1 ) . The observed systemic adverse effects were significantly higher than the expected rates . As depicted in Fig . 1 , even on the 7th day after vaccina - tion , the ratio of observed to expected systemic reacto - genicities is high ( nearly four ) , and its lower bounds are higher than one . Figures 2 and 3 present the local and systemic adverse effects in different vaccine brands in 7 days after the first and second doses of vaccines . The most common local adverse effect reported in all vaccines was pain at the injection site , and the most common systemic adverse effect in all vaccines was fatigue . Most adverse effects had lower frequency after the second dose of vaccines . The systemic adverse effects were higher in each dose in the first 24 h after injection ( Fig . 3 ) . Except for redness , itching , and bruising , a similar pattern was also present for local adverse effects ( Fig . 2 ) . Compared to Sinopharm and Barekat , AZD1222 and Sputnik V had a higher fre - quency of local and systemic adverse effects ( Table 2 , Figs . 2 and 3 ) . The average days with at least one local adverse effect after receiving all vaccines’ first and second doses was 1 . 81 and 1 . 05 days , respectively . It was higher for AZD1222 than other vaccines . Moreover , the average number of days with pain in injection site in the first and second doses were higher than other adverse effects . The average days with at least one systematic adverse effect in individuals after receiving the first and second doses of all vaccines were 3 . 71 and 2 . 87 days , respectively . Again , it was higher for AZD1222 than other vaccines . Also , the average number of days with fatigue in the first , and fever in the second dose were higher than other adverse effects ( Table 3 ) . Compared to Sinopharm , both local and systemic adverse effects of AZD122 and Sputnik vaccines were higher after the first or second doses . The systemic adverse effects of Barekat were lower than Sinopharm Page 4 of 15 Enayatrad et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 150 ( OR = 0 . 56 , 95 % CI 0 . 46 – 0 . 67 ) while its local adverse effects were similar to Sinopharm ( P value : 0 . 969 ) after the first dose of vaccines . In the second dose , while the systemic adverse effects of Barekat were similar to Sin - opharm ( P value = 0 . 443 ) , its local adverse effects were higher than Sinopharm ( OR = 2 . 98 , 95 % CI 2 . 29 – 3 . 87 ) . There were no significant differences between the local and systemic adverse effects of AZD1222 and Sputnik vaccines for the second doses . Local and systemic adverse effects of Barekat were lower than AZD1222 and Sputnik in both doses of vaccines ( Table 4 ) . Except for systemic adverse effects after the second dose of vaccines , local and systemic adverse effects decreased with an increase in age . All local and systemic adverse effects were higher in female participants . Prior COVID - 19 disease increased the odds of local and systemic adverse effects only after the first dose of vaccines . Among the comorbidities , allergy and hypertension increased the odds of local adverse effects after the first dose of vaccines . Allergy , cardiac diseases , and cancers increased the odds of sys - temic adverse effects after the first dose of vaccines . Can - cers were the only comorbidity that increased the odds of systemic adverse effects after the second dose of vaccines ( OR = 1 . 87 , 95 % CI 1 . 25 – 2 . 80 ) , as shown in Table 4 . Multiple Logistic regression results for the odds of local and systemic side effects after the first dose of vaccines are shown in Table 5 . All local and systemic adverse effects were higher in female participants and decreased with an increase in the age of participants . The odds of redness , induration , itching and swelling were higher in obese par - ticipants . Prior COVID - 19 disease increased the odds of pain at injection site and systemic adverse effects except for nausea and fever . Headache was lower in participants with comorbidities ( OR = 0 . 81 , 95 % CI 0 . 69 – 0 . 96 ) . In another multiple logistic regression models the asso - ciated factors with local and systemic adverse effects after the second dose of vaccines were investigated and pre - sented in Table 6 . The results were almost similar to the above findings for the first dose . All local and systemic adverse effects were higher in female participants . Except for warmness , itching and swelling , other local and sys - temic adverse effects decreased with an increase in age . Comorbidities only increased the odds of pain at injection site ( P value = 0 . 048 ) and were not associated with other local and systemic adverse effects . Obesity only increased the odds of redness after the second dose of vaccines . Prior COVID - 19 disease increased the odds of pain at injection site and all systemic adverse effects except nausea .

BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 150 the Barekat vaccine was lower than the other three vaccines , and the malaise , chills , headache , and myal - gia interfered more with people’s daily activities than other adverse effects . Besides , these side effects were reported more in the first dose of AZD1222 ( Fig . 4 ) . Discussion In this study , performed in several cities in Iran , the local and systemic reactogenicities of the COVID - 19 vaccines were investigated . AZD1222 and Sputnik had highest local and systemic adverse effects frequency , while most adverse effects were the lowest in Barekat recipients . Except for AZD1222 , the incidence of local and sys - temic adverse effects was mild to moderate and did not interfere with the daily activities of most individuals . The adverse effects in the second dose were less than in the first . Similar to our findings other studies reported a higher rate of reactogenicity after the first dose of Astra - Zeneca [ 15 , 16 ] and Sputnik V [ 17 ] . Adverse events after the first dose of Janssen vaccine were also higher than its second dose [ 16 ] . However , in some studies [ 8 , 18 – 20 ] , it has been shown that adverse effects in the second dose were more than in the first dose . This could be due to the nature of the vaccines used , the response of the indi - vidual’s immune system , the study methods and location , and age and sex differences between studies . Consider - ing our results and the findings of a systematic review and meta - analysis study [ 21 ] , it can be confirmed that first dose of adenovirus vectored vaccines is more reac - togenic than the second one . For the mRNA and protein subunit vaccines , the opposite is true . For the Sinopharm , we also find similar results to AZD1222 and Sputnik regarding comparing adverse effects in two doses of vac - cines . This finding was similar to the results of another study in the UAE [ 22 ] . However , in another inactivated vaccine ( Barekat ) , the frequency of at least one local adverse effect was higher after the second dose , and for the systemic adverse effects , the difference between the two doses was not significant . This pattern was similar to the results of another study on CoronaVac , which is an inactivated COVID - 19 vaccine [ 23 ] . It seems that the pain in injection site , which was higher after the second dose of the Barekat vaccine , caused a higher frequency of at least one local adverse effect after the second dose of Barekat . Considering the limited evidence for reac - togenicity events of the Barekat vaccine , more studies with a higher sample size are needed to justify the above findings . Another study in Turkey [ 24 ] , showed a higher incidence of reactogenicities after the second dose of Covaxine ( an inactivated vaccine similar to Barekat ) and a lower incidence of reactogenicities after the second dose of Covishield . After each dose , the most commonly reported reac - tions were pain at the injection site and fatigue , followed by malaise in all vaccines . Various studies [ 8 , 17 , 25 – 31 ] showed that pain at the injection site is the most com - mon local reactogenicity reported . Also , studies con - ducted in the third phase of the clinical trials [ 32 , 33 ] indicated that pain at the injection site was reported as the most common complication . Moreover , injection site pain has been commonly reported as a local reaction in other COVID - 19 vaccines [ 34 ] .

BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 150 Fig . 4 The severity of adverse effects in the first days after the first and second doses of COVID‑19 vaccines Page 12 of 15 Enayatrad et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 150 Adverse effects after the AZD1222 vaccination were higher than other vaccines . Other studies also showed similar findings [ 8 , 30 , 35 ] . It is believed that the high local and systemic adverse effects of AZD1222 might be because it is a non - reproducible adenovirus carrier vac - cine and uses a protein similar to the protein produced by the SARS - CoV2 virus following a natural infection [ 36 , 37 ] . Lower frequency of adverse effects after vaccination with Barekat and Sinopharm can be attributed to their nature , which are inactivated vaccines . Many other stud - ies [ 21 – 24 , 35 ] also reported a lower frequency of local and systemic adverse effects in recipients of inactivated vaccines . Differences in vaccine platforms and structures , immunogenicity , and mechanism of action are the main reasons for the discrepancy between the reactogenicities of COVID - 19 vaccines . This study found that pain at the injection site and fatigue were the most common local and systemic adverse effects of the Sinopharm vaccine , which was con - sistent with studies carried out in the Czech Republic [ 38 ] , Iraq [ 35 ] , China [ 39 ] , and the United Arab Emirates [ 31 ] . The most common adverse effects of the Sputnik V vaccine were also pain at the injection site and fatigue . In a clinical trial conducted in Russia [ 7 ] , this vaccine’s most common adverse effects were pain at the injection site , fever , and chills . Also , in a study conducted on health workers [ 17 ] , it was shown that pain at the injection site and fatigue were the most common adverse effects of Sputnik V and these reactogenicities were significantly more common in women and young people . In the cur - rent study , similar to other vaccines , the most common adverse effects of Barekat were pain at the injection site and fatigue . Several risk factors related to local and systemic adverse effects after vaccination were identified in the present study . These risk factors include younger age , female sex , and BMI greater than 30 kg / m 2 . These find - ings are similar to the findings of studies carried out in the Czech Republic [ 36 ] , Netherlands [ 40 ] , Iraq [ 35 ] , the United Kingdom [ 8 ] , Saudi Arabia [ 27 ] , Jordan [ 28 , 41 , 42 ] , India [ 29 ] as well as the findings of the third phase of several clinical trials [ 32 , 33 , 43 ] . However , a study in Saudi Arabia [ 25 ] showed that the reactogenicities were higher in men than women , possibly due to the high pro - portion of men participating in that study [ 43 ] . The female gender was considered a significant risk factor for adverse effects following vaccination . Women generally have more robust immune responses than men [ 43 ] . Hence , they are more likely to have frequent and severe adverse effects . This difference may be related to genetic or hormonal differences between women and men [ 44 ] . In this study , allergy , hypertension , cardiac diseases and cancer were the underlying diseases that increased the odds of adverse effects . Other studies in Iraq [ 35 ] and the Netherlands [ 40 ] showed that asthma , hypertension , dia - betes , and respiratory diseases are significant risk factors for post - vaccination adverse effects . Similarly , food and / or drug allergies and chronic diseases were associated with a higher frequency of post - vaccination side effects [ 45 – 47 ] . On the other hand , in a study done in France [ 26 ] , no association was observed between disease his - tory and vaccines’ reactogenicity . Although most stud - ies showed a positive association between the presence of chronic diseases and reactogenicities , the underlying mechanisms are unclear . Interaction of vaccines with medications used , different immunological responses , better reporting and perceptions of adverse effects , and lower tolerance to adverse effects ( in the case of can - cers ) are among the proposed mechanisms which should be investigated exclusively . The differences in the age groups , vaccine brands , prevalence of comorbidities , and sample size may be the reasons for the difference in stud - ies’ results . Our results showed that prior COVID - 19 infection increased the odds of local and systemic adverse effects only after the first dose of vaccines . A study in Mexico on people who received the BNT162b2 vaccine [ 48 ] , and another on BNT162b2 , mRNA - 1273 and Ad26 . COV2 . S vaccines [ 20 ] also reported similar findings . Higher T - cell and antibody responses in participants with a history of COVID - 19 infection may be the reason for this finding . It has been shown that T - cell responses and anti - spike anti - bodies were higher after the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine in people with prior COVID - 19 infection com - pared to infection - naive people . These responses were similar after two doses of the vaccine in infection - naive people and people with prior COVID - 19 infection [ 49 ] . In fact , the first vaccine dose boosts the immune responses in people with prior COVID - 19 infection , while the second vaccine dose results in little increase in immune responses [ 50 ] . Finally , other studies reported a higher frequency of adverse effects in participants with prior COVID - 19 infection [ 8 , 35 , 40 , 51 , 52 ] . In the current study , most reported local and systemic adverse effects were mild to moderate in severity . In a clinical trial [ 32 ] on the AZD1222 vaccine and another study in Saudi Arabia [ 25 ] , it was observed that the sever - ity of adverse effects was mild to moderate . Also , in other studies on the Sinopharm vaccine [ 28 , 29 , 31 , 41 ] , the adverse effects have been mild . The severity of local and systemic adverse effects is influenced by the nature of the vaccines [ 28 ] , the number of doses received , and the age and gender of participants . Page 13 of 15 Enayatrad et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 150 The present study has various strengths , including using a standard protocol provided by WHO , active daily contact and direct monitoring of the study’s implementa - tion , comparing four different vaccines , and using online methods and telephone calls to report adverse effects . However , the sample size for the second dose of Barekat did not reach 1000 participants , which might be a limita - tion of the current study . As another limitation , the par - ticipants’ weight and height did not measure and were based on self - reporting . Conclusions In this study , adverse effects after vaccination ( both sys - temic and local ) often had the highest incidence in 1 to 2 days after vaccination and reached their lowest level at the end of the first week . Besides , pain at the injection site and fatigue were the most common reactogenicities of COVID - 19 vaccination . However , most local and sys - temic adverse effects were not severe and did not inter - fere with people’s daily activities . AZD1222 and Sputnik had higher adverse effects frequencies than Sinopharm and Barekat vaccines . Furthermore , younger age , female gender , some comorbidities , and prior COVID - 19 infec - tion were associated with higher reactogenicities .
