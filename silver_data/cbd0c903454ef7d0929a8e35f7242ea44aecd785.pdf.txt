Saskia Schröter , Sabrina Beckmann and Hans Dieter Schmitt * Neurobiology , Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry , Göttingen , Germany Coat complexes are important for cargo selection and vesicle formation . Recent evidence suggests that they may also be involved in vesicle targeting . Tethering factors , which form an initial bridge between vesicles and the target membrane , may bind to coat complexes . In this review , we ask whether these coat / tether interactions share some common mechanisms , or whether they are special adaptations to the needs of very speciﬁc transport steps . We compare recent ﬁndings in two multisubunit tethering complexes , the Dsl1 complex and the HOPS complex , and put them into context with the TRAPP I complex as a prominent example for coat / tether interactions . We explore where coat / tether interactions are found , compare their function and structure , and comment on a possible evolution from a common ancestor of coats and tethers . Keywords : vesicle trafﬁcking , coat complexes , protocoatomer , coated vesicles , tethering complex INTRODUCTION In eukaryotic cells , vesicles pass material from one membrane compartment to the other . The cells use elaborate systems of cytoplasmic factors to control the luminal content as well as membrane constituents of the diﬀerent vesicles ( Rothman and Orci , 1992 ) . Factors on the cytosolic side of vesicles and target membrane also impose directionality to the transport process . This is achieved through the recognition of the cargo by cargo receptors at the donor membrane and through the correct identiﬁcation of the vesicle at the target membrane . Both cargo and vesicle recognition are controlled by small GTPases . GTPases of the ARF family control the cargo selection by coat complexes , while GTPases of the Ypt / Rab family are required for the fusion of vesicles with the appropriate target membrane ( Behnia and Munro , 2005 ) . The main players during vesicle formation are coat complexes . They consist of soluble proteins and are recruited from the cytosol by cargo molecules . The coat formation leads to the bending of the donor membrane and , ﬁnally , vesicle release . Members of the SNARE family of membrane proteins are among these cargo molecules ( Kuehn et al . , 1998 ; Rein et al . , 2002 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) . They are the actual catalysts of membrane fusion ( Söllner et al . , 1993 ) . Thus , SNARE proteins have two roles , one in vesicle formation and one in vesicle fusion . The packaging of speciﬁc SNAREs into vesicles is one important means to convey vesicle identity and ensure the fusion at the correct target membrane : Each transport step in the cell uses a speciﬁc set of SNAREs ( McNew et al . , 2000 ) . The formation of helical bundles from SNAREs on vesicle and target membrane provides the energy to fuse the apposed membranes . However , SNAREs are not suﬃcient to guarantee that vesicles ﬁnd their right target membrane ( Brandhorst et al . , 2006 ) . Instead , additional components are recruited , often by the combined action of SNAREs and GTPases . These so - called tethering factors are thought to mediate the ﬁrst contact between membranes that are bound to fuse ( Cao et al . , 1998 ; Whyte and Munro , 2002 ) . They bind to proteins on opposite membranes , and at least some of these tethering factors also can bind speciﬁc phospholipids directly . Whether Schröter et al . Coat / Tether Interactions the tethering factors in fact form bridges between two diﬀerent membranes and thus represent real tethers has not been shown for all putative tethering factors ( Brunet and Sacher , 2014 ) . All SNAREs share a strongly conserved core structure , and the tetrameric SNARE complexes assemble mostly in a 3 : 1 ratio from three SNAREs on the target membrane and one SNARE on the vesicle membrane . Compared to SNAREs , the tethering factors are a much more heterogeneous group of proteins . In particular , the number of subunits making up multisubunit complexes ranges from 3 to 10 and cannot be identiﬁed by conserved sequence motifs or easily recognized by Hidden Markov model proﬁles , as is the case for SNARE proteins ( Kloepper et al . , 2007 ) . Some Golgi - associated tethering factors are homodimers made up of long coiled – coil proteins ( Yu and Hughson , 2010 ) . Tethering factors ( or complexes ) interact with SNAREs and / or GTPases to control the speciﬁcity of vesicle fusion . In recent years , however , a number of papers came out where evidence was presented that tethering complexes can also interact with coat complexes ( Trahey and Hay , 2010 ; Angers and Merz , 2011 ) . This indicates that cells may use the coats not only for vesicle budding , but they may also keep them as stick - on labels that carry address information . Beside the coat / tether interactions discussed below in more detail , evidence was presented for a number of other coat / tether interactions . Most of them involve interactions of the COPI coat and diﬀerent Golgi tethering factors : In yeast , the Trs120p subunit of Golgi tether TRAPP II co - puriﬁes with the COPI subunit α - COP , while experiments with the homologous subunit of the mammalian TRAPP II complex showed interaction with γ - COP but not ε - COP ( Yamasaki et al . , 2009 ) . γ - COP in yeast ( Sec21p ) is also the interacting partner of the intra - Golgi COG tethering complex ( Suvorova et al . , 2002 ) . Analogously , β - COP co - puriﬁes with Cog3 from mammalian cells ( Zolov and Lupashin , 2005 ) . A non - COPI / tether interaction was observed in mammalian cells , where the TGN - localized tether Rab6IP1 ( Rab6 interacting protein 1 ) interacts with the retromer component SNX1 ( sorting nexin 1 ; Wassmer et al . , 2009 ) . An overview of currently known coat / tether interactions is given in Figure 1 . This review explores whether coat / tether interactions were a fundamental feature of primordial tethering complexes in early eukaryotic cells , or whether they developed independently . We will focus on three prominent coat / tether interactions for our analyses : The interaction of ( i ) the COPI coat and the Dsl1 complex involved in Golgi to ER retrograde transport , ( ii ) the AP - 3 coat and the HOPS complex , an interaction that mediates direct transport of transmembrane proteins of the limiting vacuolar membrane from the trans - Golgi to the lysosome . We will put our ﬁndings into context with the interaction of ( iii ) the COPII coat and the TRAPP I complex , which is required for ER to Golgi forward transport ( recent evidence in fact calls into question the classiﬁcation of TRAPP complexes as tethers , as discussed later ) . Table 1 lists the constituents of the coats and tethers mentioned , and some of their properties and interaction partners . TIMING AND FACTORS OF VESICLE COAT REMOVAL The uncoating of vesicles is initiated during or shortly after scission of the newly formed vesicles , either by the recruitment of uncoating factors or by inactivating GTPases that control the coat formation . Clearly , the presence of a complete coat would prevent the SNARE - mediated fusion of the vesicles with the target membrane . It is thus crucial to examine what is known about the uncoating processes in transport steps , and how this may interplay in a timely manner with a possible recognition of the vesicle through its coat . The removal of coat elements is best studied for clathrin , where the disassembly of the triskelia is catalyzed by the ATPase Hsp70 . The uncoating enzyme is recruited to the vesicle by a co - chaperone with binding sites for clathrin and Hsp70 , either neuronal auxilin 1 or the ubiquitously expressed GAK / auxilin 2 ( Ungewickell et al . , 1995 ; Greener et al . , 2000 ) . In clathrin - coated endocytic AP - 2 vesicles , where adaptor proteins ( AP - 2 ) and cargo can be analyzed by TIRF ( total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ) microscopy , the removal of the clathrin cage and the adaptor layer may happen independently ( Rappoport et al . , 2006 ) . A large part of the clathrin disappears from vesicles shortly after scission , before the vesicles move away from the plasma membrane ( Massol et al . , 2006 ; Mattheyses et al . , 2011 ) . Auxilin is recruited in a burst , shortly before the coat formation is complete ( Massol et al . , 2006 ) . This observation could point toward a simple stochastically driven loss of the coat . An alternative interpretation , however , is that the observed heterogeneity of the kinetics is due to diﬀerent populations of clathrin - coated vesicles . Diﬀerences in the persistence of the coat may reﬂect diﬀerences in cargo and in the sites to which the vesicles are headed . AP - 1 and AP - 3 dependent intracellular transport is more diﬃcult to analyze . Three - dimensional time - lapse movies had to be recorded for AP - 1 and AP - 3 vesicles , and their lifetime is comparable to that of AP - 2 vesicles ( Kural et al . , 2012 ) . The apparently heterogeneous disassembly behavior of the clathrin cage makes it rather unlikely that clathrin is typically involved in vesicle recognition through tethers at the target membrane . Currently , no evidence exists that the clathrin cage is recognized by tethers or used for recognition at the target membrane , even though this is not a conclusive argument to rule out such a function . The adaptor complexes on the other hand are candidates for coat / tether interactions ; and indeed one example of such an interaction has been reported , as discussed later . Initial evidence for an early removal of the COP coats came from the analysis of factors that stimulate the activity of small GTPases required for coat and vesicle formation . The stimulation of their low intrinsic GTPase activity inactivates them and induces their release from the membrane ( Pucadyil and Schmid , 2009 ) . In the case of the COPII coat , this activation is achieved by the fully assembled coat itself , where components of the inner and the outer layer of the coat act synergistically on the small GTPase Sar1p ( Antonny et al . , 1997 ) . In contrast , the GTPase Arf1p that is required for COPI coat assembly is activated by proteins that can sense the curvature of the vesicle Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 2 May 2016 | Volume 4 | Article 44 Schröter et al .

Both ﬁndings , however , were interpreted in a way that COPI and COPII vesicles lose their coat quite early after ﬁssion . However , more recent ﬁndings suggest that these results may not fully reﬂect the physiologically occurring processes . Mutations in subunits of the Dsl1 complex or the HOPS complex as well as mutations in the corresponding SNAREs led to the accumulation of large amounts of coated vesicles ( Angers and Merz , 2009 ; Zink et al . , 2009 ) , suggesting that the tethering complexes are involved in uncoating . In addition , CHO cells depleted of a COG subunit accumulate COPI - coated vesicles ( Zolov and Lupashin , 2005 ) . These results indicate that vesicles still carry their coat when they arrive at the target membrane , and that coat / tether interactions are possible in vivo . The recently determined structure of the COPI coat revealed that the building blocks of the coat , the triads , are connected by those domains that are the binding sites for Dsl1p of the Dsl1 tethering complex . The µ - domain of δ - COP at some linkages , or ε - COP and the C - terminus of α - COP at others ( Andag and Schmitt , 2003 ; Zink et al . , 2009 ; Hsia and Hoelz , 2010 ; Dodonova et al . , 2015 ; Suckling et al . , 2015 ) . This indicates that the Dsl1 complex may be involved in the removal of triads from the vesicle , possibly by competitively binding COPI complexes at these connection sites thus disassembling the coat units . Further proof for this is required since uncoating could not be reconstituted in vitro so far . Interestingly though , these ﬁndings suggest that the timed coat removal of COPI vesicles diﬀers from that of clathrin coats , at least in yeast : The coat of COPI vesicles appears to be released only after vesicle recognition on the target membrane . Comparable COPII clusters were only observed in COPII budding mutants , and not in mutants with fusion defects ( Shindiapina and Barlowe , 2010 ) . More precisely , the mutation of the COPI tether Uso1p did not lead to accumulation of coated COPII vesicles . However , independent evidence indicates that COPII vesicles may remain partially coated : COPII vesicles that are formed by permeabilized NRK cells carry more than 55 % of the inner COPII shell and 15 % of the outer COPII shell ( Cai et al . , 2007 ; Bentley et al . , 2010 ) . Vesicles produced in vitro by permeabilized yeast cells also retain most of their coat , as determined for subunits from the inner and outer shell ( Lord et al . , 2011 ) . The results support the hypothesis that coats or partially present coats on vesicles may be used for identiﬁcation at the target membrane ( Trahey and Hay , 2010 ) .

If the tethering indeed involves their interaction with the vesicle coat , then the tethering complexes should either be localized at the target membrane , or they must be recruited to it during the tethering process . The Dsl1 complex and its mammalian counterpart , the syntaxin 18 or NRZ complex ( Aoki et al . , 2009 ; Civril et al . , 2010 ) , are in a very tight complex with the ER - localized SNAREs , and visualization of their constituents gave a pattern consistent with an ER localization ( Figure 2A ; Reilly et al . , 2001 ; Hirose et al . , 2004 ; Arasaki et al . , 2006 ; Aoki et al . , 2009 ; Meiringer et al . , 2011 ) . For additional details on the more complex functional aspects of the mammalian ZW10 complex , see Schmitt ( 2010 ) . Similarly , the HOPS complex localizes to the target membrane of AP - 3 vesicles , the lysosome , but also to late endosomes or multivesicular bodies ( MVB ) ( Nakamura et al . , 1997 ; Cabrera et al . , 2010 ) . This reﬂects the fact that the HOPS is involved in diﬀerent transport steps : ( i ) homotypic lysosome / lysosome fusion , ( ii ) late endosome ( MVB ) / lysosome fusion and ( iii ) the fusion of AP - 3 coated vesicles with the lysosome ( Bowers and Stevens , 2005 ) . This begs the question how the speciﬁc localization of tethers is determined . RECRUITMENT FACTORS OF TETHERS ( 1 ) : SNAREs None of the tethers discussed here has subunits that carry a transmembrane domain . In fact , only a few homodimeric coiled - coil Golgi tethers like giantin are integral membrane proteins ( Gillingham and Munro , 2003 ) . Therefore , the sites that the Dsl1 , HOPS , and TRAPP complexes are recruited to are determined by additional factors on the surface of the membranes . Here , a very interesting interaction comes into play : Both the Dsl1 and the HOPS complex were shown to bind single SNAREs via N - terminal domains that lie in front of the SNARE domains . In case of the Dsl1 complex , these are the N - terminal domains of the Q b - SNARE Sec20p and the Q c - SNARE Use1p ( Ren et al . , 2009 ; Diefenbacher et al . , 2011 ; Meiringer et al . , 2011 ) . Both domains do not show any sequence similarities to other N - terminal domains of SNARE proteins and were not predicted to contain either a lipid binding domain , a longin or H abc α - helical domain . Surprisingly , the formation of only one of these two connections is still suﬃcient for cell viability ( Kraynack et al . , 2005 ; Tripathi et al . , 2009 ) . Ren et al . ( 2009 ) also observed binding to the fully assembled SNARE complex , while Meiringer et al . ( 2011 ) observed very ineﬃcient binding of the full set of SNAREs to the Dsl1 complex in vitro . Instead , they found that the lipid - anchored R - SNARE Ykt6p may act as an acceptor for Sec22p , the R - SNARE that associates with the Q - SNAREs at the ER .

Coat / Tether Interactions FIGURE 2 | Models for the interaction of the Dsl1 and HOPS complexes with COPI or AP - 3 coats . ( A ) The structure of the Dsl tethering according to the structures determined by the Hughson lab ( Ren et al . , 2009 ; Tripathi et al . , 2009 ) . Dsl1p binds COPI coat via an unstructured lasso domain ( Andag and Schmitt , 2003 ; Ren et al . , 2009 ; Schmitt , 2010 ; Suckling et al . , 2015 ) at the sites where the coat triads connect ( Dodonova et al . , 2015 ) . They may represent the sites where coat depolymerization begins . ( B , C ) Two different tethering modes of the HOPS complex at the surface of the lysosome ( Cabrera et al . , 2010 ) . The arrangement of subunits as shown here was determined by negative stain EM of different HOPS constructs ( Kuhlee et al . , 2015 ) . ( C ) Depicts the HOPS complex as a tether bridging two membranes very much like in homotypic lysosome - lysosome fusion . At the surface of the multivesicular body , however , the Vps41 subunit can bind to the curved membrane via its curvature - sensing ALPS domain . In this conformation , the binding site for the δ - subunit of the AP - 3 complex is masked ( C ) . At the surface of the ﬂat lysosome , in contrast , the ALPS domain cannot bind efﬁciently to the membrane , ( i ) due to lower curvature of the membrane and , ( ii ) , since the ALPS motif is phosphorylated by the Yck3 kinase ( B ) . For the interaction with the membrane , HOPS has to rely solely on the interaction of Vps41p with GTP - bound Ypt7p and on the ability of other HOPS subunits to bind to acidic lipids ( not illustrated here ; Behrmann et al . , 2014 ; Orr et al . , 2015 ) . Importantly , in this conﬁguration the δ - subunit of the AP - 3 complex has access to its binding site at the Vps41p subunit , a double leucine motif marked as LL in this Figure . By using this speciﬁc binding mode , Golgi - derived AP - 3 coated vesicles preferentially bind to HOPS complexes at the surface of the lysosome thereby avoiding fusion with endosomes . The Sly1 proteins may act as additional potential recruiting factors for the Dsl1 / NRZ complexes . They are members of the Sec1 / Munc18 - like protein family ( SM ) , which cooperate with SNAREs during vesicle fusion . The Sly1 proteins act in transport between ER and Golgi , and there is evidence that Sly1p is required for retrograde transport ( Reilly et al . , 2001 ; VanRheenen et al . , 2001 ; Li et al . , 2005 ) . It associates with the tethering complex in yeast and mammalian cells to varying degrees . It may do so indirectly through its interaction with the SNAREs ( Hirose et al . , 2004 ; Kraynack et al . , 2005 ; Li et al . , 2005 ) . The HOPS complex also binds to individual SNARE proteins , and contains a stably associated SNARE interacting SM protein ( Seals et al . , 2000 ) . It binds the Q a - SNARE Vam3p via its N - terminal H abc - domain , and the Q c - SNARE Vam7p via the PX lipid - binding domain ( Krämer and Ungermann , 2011 ; Lobingier and Merz , 2012 ; Lürick et al . , 2015 ) . In addition , the HOPS complex can interact with partially or fully assembled bundles of the SNARE domains ( Baker et al . , 2015 ; Lürick et al . , 2015 ) . This interaction is mediated by the stable HOPS subunit Vps33p , a member of the Sec1 / Munc18 protein ( SM ) family . Vps33p , unlike other SM proteins like Vps45 and Munc18 , is not able to recognize the N - terminal peptide or the H abc domain of Vam3p on its own , and requires Vps16p in addition to fulﬁll this task ( Lürick et al . , 2015 ) . The same subunit plus Vps18p is involved in binding of the PX - domain of Vam7p ( Krämer and Ungermann , 2011 ) . In summary , both the Dsl1 and the HOPS complexes are able to bind to individual SNAREs as well as assembled SNARE complexes ( Ren et al . , 2009 ; Krämer and Ungermann , 2011 ; Lobingier and Merz , 2012 ; Baker et al . , 2015 ) . This suggests that their function lasts across the SNARE zippering process , possibly by acting as SNARE complex assembly factors ( Baker et al . , 2015 ) . As mentioned above , SNAREs are promiscuous , so additional recruiting factors are needed . In fact , the tethering complex / SNARE interactions may not be essential for the actual tethering step ( Hickey and Wickner , 2010 ) , since the HOPS complex can rely on GTPase or direct binding to lipids for the docking of membranes , as discussed in the next paragraph . RECRUITMENT FACTORS OF TETHERS ( 2 ) : SMALL GTPases AND LIPIDS Another class of proteins that are both key to membrane identity and act as recruiting factors for tethering complexes are the small GTPases of the Ypt / Rab family . For the Dsl1 complex - dependent retrograde transport , the Spang lab has used a YPT1 ( Rab1 ) knock - out strain to show that this GTPase is not only required for forward transport , but is also involved in Golgi - ER retrograde transport in yeast ( Kamena Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 5 May 2016 | Volume 4 | Article 44 Schröter et al . Coat / Tether Interactions et al . , 2008 ) . Mammalian cells express a much larger set of Ypt / Rab GTPases , and the retrograde transport is regulated by a specialized small GTPase Rab18 . Evidence for an involvement of Rab / Ypt GTPase in the tethering process of COPI vesicles in mammalian cells was presented recently by Gillingham et al . ( 2014 ) who identiﬁed the Dsl1 / NRZ complex as an eﬀector of Rab18 . For the HOPS complex - dependent tethering to vacuolar membranes , the small Ypt / Rab GTPase Ypt7p was shown to be more important than the interaction of HOPS with SNAREs ( Hickey et al . , 2009 ; Hickey and Wickner , 2010 ) . In fact , the HOPS complex is an eﬀector of Ypt7p , since it preferentially binds to the GTP - bound form of this small GTPase ( Price et al . , 2000 ) In addition , the HOPS complex can bind to the membrane directly via the head groups of phosphoinositides and other acidic lipids ( Stroupe et al . , 2006 ; Behrmann et al . , 2014 ; Orr et al . , 2015 ) . The HOPS complex seems to be ideally suited as a tether since it carries two diﬀerent Ypt7 - binding subunits , Vps39p and Vps41p ( also known as Vam6p and Vam2p ; Price et al . , 2000 ; Brett et al . , 2008 ) . Both are positioned at the opposing ends of its elongated structure ( Bröcker et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , the HOPS complex can form a bridge between late endosomes or multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) on one side and the lysosome on the other side by interacting with Ypt7 GTPases on the opposing membranes ( Ho and Stroupe , 2015 ) . Besides this two - armed tethering mode , the lysosome - localized HOPS complex can also act as a receptor for AP - 3 vesicles via Apl5p , the δ - adaptin - like subunit of the AP - 3 coat ( Rehling et al . , 1999 ; Angers and Merz , 2009 ; Figure 2B ) . This tethering mode requires the presence of Ypt7p only on the target membrane . Transport via the AP - 3 - coated vesicles is involved in a special transport route between Golgi and lysosome , by which yeast cells avoid fusion of vesicles carrying lysosome - bound membrane proteins with multivesicular bodies . In yeast , this is achieved by direct vesicular transport from the Golgi to the lysosome via AP - 3 vesicles . A typical cargo for this step is the enzyme alkaline phosphatase ( ALP , Pho8p ) . Some other cargo proteins are themselves part of the targeting machinery , like the SNAREs Vam3p and Nyv1p and the lipid - anchored Type I casein kinase Yck3p ( Cowles et al . , 1997 ; Ostrowicz et al . , 2008 ) . The AP - 3 transport route prevents these proteins from being internalized by the MVBs or from becoming active at the surface of endosomes . How can the HOPS complex switch between the diﬀerent tethering modes ? One obvious possibility is through posttranslational modiﬁcations . The phosphorylation of the HOPS complex changes the dependence of HOPS on Ypt7 - GTP for its tethering function ( Brett et al . , 2008 ; Cabrera et al . , 2009 ; Ho and Stroupe , 2015 ) . Recent in vitro experiments with liposomes clearly showed that the phosphorylated HOPS requires Ypt7 - GTP for tethering , while non - phosphorylated HOPS complex is active if Ypt7 - GDP is present on both membranes ( Zick and Wickner , 2012 ; Ho and Stroupe , 2015 ) . This antagonistic relationship between phosphorylation and the GTP / GDP status suggests that the phosphorylation adjusts the balance between the diﬀerent membrane recruitment modes for HOPS . Signiﬁcantly , the enzyme that phosphorylates the HOPS complex was mentioned above already as cargo of the AP - 3 pathway . This membrane - anchored kinase , Yck3p , depends on this transport route for its proper localization to the lysosome ( Sun et al . , 2004 ; LaGrassa and Ungermann , 2005 ) . At the same time , Yck3p was shown to be as equally required for proper functioning of the AP - 3 pathway as the subunits of the AP - 3 coat ( Anand et al . , 2009 ; Cabrera et al . , 2009 ) . A clue as to how Yck3p can mechanistically bring about the switch in tethering modes of the HOPS complex came when Christian Ungermann’s lab identiﬁed the phosphorylation sites and the AP - 3 binding site within HOPS . Both are located in the N - terminal part of the Ypt7p - interacting subunit Vps41p ( Cabrera et al . , 2009 , 2010 ) . The binding site for the AP - 3 subunit Apl5p lies in front of the putative β - propeller domain ( Cabrera et al . , 2010 ) , while the phosphosites lie within an α - helical region that is adjacent to the opposite end the putative β - propeller ( Cabrera et al . , 2009 ) . This means that the phosphosites and the Apl5p - binding site come close to each other in the Vps41 protein and thus may aﬀect each other directly ( The same region is also involved in the binding of Ypt7p ) . The α - helical region was predicted to constitute a so - called ArfGAP1 lipid packing sensor or amphipathic lipid packing sensor ( ALPS ) motif ( Drin et al . , 2007 ) . Phosphomimetic mutations in this domain prevent membrane binding in vivo and in vitro ( Cabrera et al . , 2009 , 2010 ) . The binding to small liposomes is also prevented when Vps41p is pre - incubated with Apl5p ( Cabrera et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , the N - terminus of Vps41p can adopt two conformations , one in which Vps41p binds to the membrane directly ( without the help of Ypt7p ) and does not allow binding of the AP - 3 coat . In the second conformation , phosphorylation of the ALPS motif prevents binding to the membrane and exposes the AP - 3 binding site . Two factors favor the transition on the ﬁrst conformation to the second : the low curvature of the lysosomal membrane and the presence of the Yck3p on the surface of the lysosome . According to the model proposed by Cabrera et al . ( 2010 ) , transition between these two states occurs after the recruitment of endosomes / MVBs to the lysosome . Since the endosomes / MVBs have a diameter of 100 nm ( Luhtala and Odorizzi , 2004 ; Balderhaar and Ungermann , 2013 ) , the membrane curvature is low and Yps41p can bind directly to it , while the AP - 3 binding site is masked ( Figure 2C ) . After fusion with the lysosome , Vps41p loses its contact with the ﬂat lysosomal membrane , the ALPS motif can be phosphorylated , thereby lowering the aﬃnity of the ALPS domain for membranes even more . As a consequence , the binding site for the AP - 3 complex becomes accessible . This ensures that the coat / tether interaction occurs only at the surface of the lysosome . Thus , the yeast cells use a sophisticated mechanism to prevent AP - 3 vesicles from fusing with MVBs . They turn a two - armed tether , which links the membranes of MVB and lysosome , to a monovalent tether that uses a coat complex as additional linker to the second membrane .

Coat / Tether Interactions CONSERVATION OF COAT / TETHER INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YEAST AND MAMMALIAN CELLS The interaction between COPI and Dsl1p was ﬁrst described in 2001 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Andag et al . , 2001 ; Reilly et al . , 2001 ) . An unstructured domain within the largest subunit of the Dsl1 complex , Dsl1p itself , is required for the binding to the COPI coat ( Andag and Schmitt , 2003 ; Ren et al . , 2009 ) . This so - called lasso domain is exposed at the tip of the whole complex approximately 20 nm above the membrane surface ( Ren et al . , 2009 ) and binds to δ - COP and α - COP via tryptophan - containing binding motifs ( Andag and Schmitt , 2003 ) . The structure of a δ - COP fragment in complex with such a W × W motif was recently determined by Suckling et al . ( 2015 ) . Another subunit of the Dsl1 complex , Tip20p , may also contribute to COPI binding ( Diefenbacher et al . , 2011 ) . Curiously , all homologs of Dsl1p from aquatic fungi , from plants and metazoans are lacking the lasso domain ( Hirose et al . , 2004 ; Schmitt , 2010 ) . Instead , in mammalian cells an additional protein called UVRAG is required for the interaction of the COPI coat with the NRZ complex ( He et al . , 2013 ) . UVRAG was hitherto known for its role in endosomal transport and autophagy as part of the Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase complex II . According to the new data , it is able to bind phosphoinositides , and it can bind to RINT - 1 , the mammalian homolog of Tip20p , to perform an additional role in Golgi - ER transport ( He et al . , 2013 ) . The UVRAG homolog in yeast , Vps38p , is involved vacuolar protein sorting , and it has not been found to act at the ER or to be involved in autophagy ( Kihara et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , the mechanism of COPI / ER tether interaction diﬀers between yeast and mammalian cells , but it is found , in variation , across species boundaries . The binding of AP - 3 vesicles to the Vps41p HOPS subunit was discovered by Rehling et al . ( 1999 ) . Angers and Merz later showed that the whole HOPS tethering complex , and not just the Vps41p subunit alone , is involved in the interaction ( Angers and Merz , 2009 ) . In metazoans , the phenotypes of AP - 3 and HOPS mutants are quite similar , indicating that the proteins act in a similar pathway ( Zlatic et al . , 2011a ) . There are , however , several discrepancies : ( i ) Unlike those from mammalian cells , AP - 3 vesicles in yeast do not carry an outer cage layer consisting of clathrin . ( ii ) The units from mammalian HOPS are found to associate with AP - 3 adaptor proteins as well as clathrin subunits ( Zlatic et al . , 2011b ) . ( iii ) AP - 3 vesicles in yeast and mammalian cells are destined for the lysosome . They form , however , at diﬀerent organelles , the late Golgi in yeast and a tubular early endosome in mammalian cells ( Dell’Angelica , 2009 ) . ( iv ) In mammalian cells , the HOPS complex is recruited to sites of AP - 3 vesicle formation , while in yeast it is recruited to the target membrane of the AP - 3 vesicles , the lysosome as well as the late endosomes . ( v ) Most relevant for the context of this review is that Vps41 from metazoans lacks the motif for AP - 3 binding and the ALPS domain for lipid binding ( Cabrera et al . , 2010 ) . However , a direct TGN to late endosome transport route for lysosomal proteins was recently described that does not require clathrin or the AP - 1 adaptor complex . The vesicles that mediate this transport carry hVps41 and the SNARE VAMP7 ( Pols et al . , 2013 ) . This shows a considerable diversiﬁcation in HOPS complex recruitment , but nevertheless its tethering function appears to have remained conserved . TETHERS AND COATS SHARE STRUCTURAL MOTIFS The last paragraphs have focused on functional interactions between coats and tethers , and have found an , if not ubiquitous , but notable range of interactions . Intriguingly , not only the interactions found in several transport routes speak for an interconnection between coats and tethers . Additionally , recently solved protein structures have revealed a surprising correspondence in structural motifs between coats and tethers . The protocoatomer architecture , an N - terminal 7 - bladed β - propeller followed by extended α - solenoids or α - zigzag linker , is found in many subunits of coat complexes ( i . e . , clathrin , Sec13p , Sec31p , α - COP and β ′ - COP ) as well as in nuclear porins ( ter Haar et al . , 1998 ; Fath et al . , 2007 ; Lee and Goldberg , 2010 ) . This β - α - fold architecture seems to be common to proteins that can bend membranes ( Devos et al . , 2006 ) . Remarkably , the β - α - fold motif was also predicted for subunits of some multisubunit tethering complexes , for most of the HOPS subunits ( including Vps3p and Vps8p from the related CORVET complex ) and the NAG subunit of the mammalian Dsl1 / NRZ complex ( Nickerson et al . , 2009 ; Civril et al . , 2010 ; Figure 3 ) . Experimental proof for its occurrence in tethers was obtained for the Vps18 subunit of the HOPS complex ( Behrmann et al . , 2014 ) . The β - propellers of clathrin heavy chains and of COPI subunits are oriented toward the membrane ( Kirchhausen and Harrison , 1984 ; Dodonova et al . , 2015 ) . Similarly , the β - propellers of the HOPS subunits Vps41p and Vps18p were shown to bind to lipids ( Cabrera et al . , 2010 ; Behrmann et al . , 2014 ) . In the Dsl1 complex of yeast the Dsl3 / Sec39 protein , a long a - solenoid , is also oriented with its N - terminus towards the membrane ( Ren et al . , 2009 ) . This would also position the β - propeller present in the mammalian Dsl3 / Sec39 homolog NAG ( neuroblastoma ampliﬁed gene ) close to the membrane ( Civril et al . , 2010 ) . Since NAG shares all structural elements with another protein , ROD , that acts together with ZW10 and a third component in the recruitment of microtubules to the kinetochore , the β - α architecture must be an ancient property of the Dsl3 / NAG proteins ( Civril et al . , 2010 ; Schmitt , 2010 ) . Fungi very likely lost the β - propeller encoding region from the corresponding gene ( Schmitt , 2010 ) . Recently , an additional similarity between COPI and HOPS / CORVET subunits was noted . At the C - termini of Vps11p , Vps18p , Vps8p , Vps39p , mammalian Vps41p and α - COP from many diﬀerent species , Zn 2 + - binding RING domains were detected ( Nickerson et al . , 2009 ; Balderhaar and Ungermann , 2013 ; Kaur and Subramanian , 2015 ) . For Vps11p , Vps18p , Vps8p , and α - COP the importance of this domain has been proven ( Eugster et al . , 2000 ; Nickerson et al . , 2009 ; Zink et al . , 2009 ) . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 7 May 2016 | Volume 4 | Article 44 Schröter et al . Coat / Tether Interactions FIGURE 3 | Predicted and observed arrangement of structural protocoatomer elements in subunits of coat and tethering complexes . The protocoatomer was identiﬁed as a potentially membrane - curving protein module in proteins of the nuclear pore complex and coat complexes ( Devos et al . , 2006 ) . Blue color indicates β - propellers or WD40 repeats , while α - solenoids are indicated by red color . RING like domains ( yellow ) were found near the C - termini of α - COP and several subunits of the HOPS and CORVET complexes ( Vps39p as shown above and in Vps8p , Vps11p and Vps18p ; Nickerson et al . , 2009 ; Kaur and Subramanian , 2015 ) . According to the protocoatomer theory , the β - α arrangement indicates a common evolutionary origin of coat complexes . Its occurrence in tethering complexes may indicate that they also share a common origin with subunits of the coat and nuclear pore complexes . The domain organization of coat complexes was deduced from the structural data ( Fath et al . , 2007 ; Lee and Goldberg , 2010 ) . For NAG , the boundaries of the domains were depicted as determined by Civril et al . ( 2010 ) . The Dsl3 / Sec39 protein is positioned below its mammalian homolog NAG ( neuroblastoma ampliﬁed gene ) in a region where both share some sequence similarities . The diagrams illustrating the domain organization and speciﬁc binding sites of the HOPS subunits were depicted as proposed by Nickerson et al . ( 2009 ) . ALPS , amphiphilic lipid - packing sensor ; RING , Really Interesting New Gene ; WD40 , 40 residue long repeat that ends with a tryptophan—aspartic acid motif ; NAG , neuroblastoma ampliﬁed gene . These common features between coat proteins and tethers make the hypothesis conceivable that the coats and tethers were more alike in an ancient eukaryote , where both formed a proteinaceous layer at the surface of intracellular membranes . From that , they diversiﬁed and developed either to the cage - forming proteins around the vesicle , or a layer of vesicle - capturing proteins at the target membrane . TRAPP I / COPII INTERACTIONS One of the best characterized coat / tether interactions is that between the TRAPP I complex and COPII coat ( Yu et al . , 2006 ; Cai et al . , 2007 ) . The ability to bind vesicle coats and its apparent steady - state Golgi localization suggested that the TRAPP I complex acts as a COPII vesicle tether ( Kim et al . , 2006 ) . Recently , evidence has accumulated that the complex acts upstream of tethering . In general , the TRAPP 1 complex shows a quite distinct behavior and structural features compared to the Dsl1 and HOPS complexes : ( i ) TRAPP I is recruited to free COPII vesicles ( Cai et al . , 2007 ) . It appears Golgi - localized at steady state since COPII vesicles fuse with their target membrane very quickly ( Wang J . et al . , 2015 ) . ( ii ) There is no direct evidence for an interaction between the TRAPP I complex and SNAREs , even though many genetic interactions of a bet3 mutation with SNARE - encoding genes have been described ( Sacher et al . , 2000 ) . ( iii ) The TRAPP I complex is an activator ( GEF ) of the ER - Golgi - speciﬁc Rab / Ypt - GTPase Ypt1p ( Jones et al . , 2000 ; Wang et al . , 2000 ) , rather than a GTPase eﬀector like for instance Vps41p of the HOPS complex . Accordingly , the TRAPP I complex does not need Ypt1p for its recruitment to vesicles . The following observations indicate that the TRAPP I complex acts before the actual tethering step . The TRAPP I subunit Bet3p binds to the same site at the COPII subunit Sec23p that is also the binding site for Sar1p , the GTPase that triggers coat formation ( Cai et al . , 2007 ; Lord et al . , 2011 ) . Notably , Bet3p and Sar1p are later displaced by the casein kinase Hrr25p ( Lord et al . , 2011 ) . This kinase is activated by Ypt1p on the vesicles ( Wang J . et al . , 2015 ) , and phosphorylation of Sec23p and Sec24p by Hrr25p is required though not suﬃcient for uncoating ( Lord et al . , 2011 ) . The phosphorylation state of Sec23p determines whether the coat subunit is ready for vesicle fusion or vesicle formation ( Murakami et al . , 1999 ; Dudognon et al . , 2004 ; Lord et al . , 2011 ; Bhandari et al . , 2013 ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings suggests that the TRAPP I binding represents an intermediate step of vesicle maturation that occurs well before the actual tethering step , and that the complex is released before COPII vesicles reach the Golgi membrane . The function of the TRAPP 1 complex rather appears to lie in determining the directionality of transport . A more likely tether for COPII vesicles is the coiled - coil homodimer tether Uso1p / p115 ( Waters et al . , 1992 ; Cao et al . , 1998 ; Allan et al . , 2000 ) . This tether is also activated by Ypt1p / Rab1 ( Allan et al . , 2000 ) , and binds to the SNAREs rbet1 and sec22b ( Wang T . et al . , 2015 ) . Since Bet1p and Sec22p are present on opposing membranes in yeast ( Parlati et al . , 2000 ) , Uso1p / p115 may bridge the gap between the membranes by Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 8 May 2016 | Volume 4 | Article 44 Schröter et al . Coat / Tether Interactions interacting with single SNAREs at the vesicle and the target membrane ( Grabski et al . , 2012 ) . CONCLUSIONS To summarize , Dsl1 / NRZ and HOPS complexes are representatives of tethering complexes that interact with coats . Both contain protocoatomer - like subunits . This indicates that these two tethers could be derived from primordial coat complexes . In ancestral eukaryotic cells , both donor and acceptor membranes may have been covered by diﬀerent coats and fusion may have been initiated by the direct contact between them . During evolution , one of these coats acquired and improved its capability to induce membrane curvature , while the other with preference for ﬂat membranes developed into a tethering factor . In line with this theory , the HOPS complex can bind to ﬂat and curved membranes in a regulated manner , but it cannot induce curvature ( Cabrera et al . , 2010 ) . The Dsl1 / NRZ complex , in contrast , is a mixture of protocoatomer and CATCHR subunits . Notably , those two tethering complexes that share some coat characteristics are able to bind coats . Since these interactions were not conserved in metazoans or require additional binding partners , it is not clear whether the coat / tether interactions described here represent remainders of an ancient fusion mechanism , or whether fungi simply reinvented this tethering mode . The fact that they are still in operation and can be used for speciﬁc targeting purposes indicates that coat / coat contacts could indeed be considered as a part of an ancient fusion mechanism . This notion is in line with the organellar paralogy model ( Dacks and Field , 2007 ) . Coat / tether interaction can be useful in preventing premature mixing of diﬀerent transport routes ( Cabrera et al . , 2010 ) or to keep membrane domains , where COPI vesicles arrive , separated from those where COPII vesicles form ( Zink et al . , 2009 ) . Of course , more research has to be done to ﬁnd whether other coat / tether interactions have specialized functions . At least one example exists where the p115 tether is involved in the regulation of COPI coat formation at the Golgi ( Guo and Linstedt , 2013 ) . The structure determination of other tethering factors will be extremely helpful in determining whether they too share motifs with coats .
