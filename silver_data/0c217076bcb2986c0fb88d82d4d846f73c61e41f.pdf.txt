This study presents a novel approach for quantitative assessment of the individual 20 infection risk of susceptible subjects exposed in indoor microenvironments in the presence of an 21 asymptomatic infected SARS - CoV - 2 subject . The approach allowed the maximum risk for an 22 exposed healthy subject to be evaluated or , starting from an acceptable risk , the maximum 23 .

We applied the proposed approach to four distinct scenarios for a prospective 24 assessment , highlighting that , in order to guarantee an acceptable individual risk of 10 - 3 for 25 exposed subjects in naturally ventilated indoor environments , the exposure time should be 26 shorter than 20 min . The proposed approach was used for retrospective assessment of 27 documented outbreaks in a restaurant in Guangzhou ( China ) and at a choir rehearsal in Mount 28 Vernon ( USA ) , showing that , in both cases , the high attack rate values can be justified only 29 assuming the airborne transmission as the main route of contagion . Moreover , we shown that 30 such outbreaks are not caused by the rare presence of a superspreader , but can be likely 31 explained by the co - existence of conditions , including emission and exposure parameters , leading 32 to a highly probable event , which can be defined as a “superspreading event” . 33 34 Keywords : SARS - CoV - 2 ( COVID - 19 ) assessment ; virus airborne transmission ; indoor ; ventilation ; 35 coronavirus . 36 37 1 . Introduction 38 The airborne transmission of a virus and the consequent contagion risk assessment is a complex 39 issue that requires multidisciplinary knowledge . It is necessary to understand the characteristics 40 and mechanisms behind the generation of respiratory microdroplets 1 , 2 , the survival of viruses in 41 microdroplets 3 , the transport of microdroplets and human exposure to them 4 , and the airflow 42 patterns that carry microdroplets in buildings 5 . Expiratory human activities generate virus - 43 carrying microdroplets that are small enough to remain aloft in air during exhalation , talking , and 44 coughing 2 , 6 , 7 . Atomization occurs in the respiratory tract , and droplets are expelled at high speed 45 during expiration 8 , 9 . Toques of liquid originating from different areas of the upper respiratory 46 tract are drawn out from the surface and broken into droplets of different sizes 10 . The findings of 47 .

In the past , backward 52 calculation was used to estimate the emission of an infected subject based on retrospective 53 assessments of infectious outbreaks only at the end of an epidemic 15 – 18 . This led to the definition 54 of emission values for each virus regardless of the type of respiratory act and the metabolic 55 activity of the infected subject . Recently , the authors presented an approach to evaluate the viral 56 load emitted by infected individuals with a view to provide new predictive capacities , not currently 57 available 19 . This approach , based on the oral viral load and the infectivity of the virus , takes into 58 account the effect of other parameters such as inhalation rate , type of respiratory activity , and 59 activity level , to estimate the quanta emission rate . This value provides key information for 60 engineers and indoor air quality experts to simulate airborne dispersion of diseases in indoor 61 environments . Indeed , the use of exposure risk models in closed environments 20 , 21 makes it 62 possible to estimate contagion starting from the emission values of a contagious subject . 63 The overall approach of emission and exposure modelling represents an essential tool to be 64 applied in enclosed spaces , and can support air quality experts and epidemiologists in the 65 management of indoor environments during an epidemic for both prospective and retrospective 66 assessments . 67 In this paper we apply a novel approach that takes into account the characteristics of the emitting 68 subject , the microenvironment , and the exposed subject to calculate the probability of infection 69 and the individual risk , for both prospective and retrospective assessments of airborne infectious 70 transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . In the case of prospective assessment , various exposure scenarios in 71 .

Materials and methods 75 To evaluate both prospective and retrospective assessments of the airborne transmission of SARS - 76 CoV - 2 , we used a four - step approach to quantify the probability of infection , i . e . the ratio between 77 infected cases and the exposed population due to exposure in a microenvironment where a SARS - 78 CoV - 2 infected subject is present . The four steps of the proposed approach are : i ) evaluation of 79 the quanta emission rate ; ii ) evaluation of the exposure to quanta concentration in the 80 microenvironment ; iii ) evaluation of the dose of quanta received by an exposed susceptible 81 subject ; and iv ) estimation of the probability of infection on the basis of a dose – response model . 82 The simulations of the probability of airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 were performed 83 applying a Monte Carlo method 22 . Further they adopted the infection risk assessment typically 84 implemented to evaluate the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and to predict the risk 85 of these diseases to the public 17 , 20 , 21 . 86 Once the probability of infection was obtained , an approach to evaluate the individual infection 87 risk , i . e . a parameter that also takes into account how likely the probability of infection can occur , 88 was also implemented . Individual risk can be easily compared to an acceptable risk , i . e . a target 89 reference risk that could be suggested by agencies and regulatory authorities to control the 90 pandemic . In the following sections , the methodologies adopted to evaluate the probability of 91 infection based on the four step approach ( section 2 . 1 ) and the individual infection risk ( section 92 2 . 2 ) are described . The application of the proposed approach for prospective and retrospective 93 assessments is described in sections 2 . 3 and 2 . 4 . 94 .

A quantum is defined as the dose of 99 airborne droplet nuclei required to infect a susceptible person . The quanta emission rate ( ER q , 100 quanta h - 1 ) was evaluated as : 101 102 (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:2) · (cid:4) (cid:3) · (cid:6)(cid:2) · (cid:7) (cid:8) (cid:4) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11) · (cid:12)(cid:13) (cid:4) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11) (cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:6) ( 1 ) 103 where c v is the viral load in the sputum ( RNA copies mL - 1 ) , c i is a conversion factor defined as the 104 ratio between one infectious quantum and the infectious dose expressed in viral RNA copies , IR is 105 the inhalation rate ( m 3 h - 1 ) , N d is the droplet number concentration ( part . cm - 3 ) , and V d ( D ) is the 106 volume of a single droplet ( mL ) as a function of the droplet diameter ( D ) . The number and volume 107 of the droplets ( V d ) is determined on the basis of data obtained experimentally by Morawska et al . 108 ( 2009 ) 6 . 109 With reference to the SARS - CoV - 2 viral load in the mouth , researchers have recently found c v 110 values of up to 10 11 copies mL - 1 , which is also variable in the same patient during the course of the 111 disease 23 – 26 . In particular , Rothe et al . 24 reported a case of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in which 112 transmission appears to have occurred during the incubation period in the index patient . A high 113 viral load of 10 8 copies mL - 1 was found , confirming that asymptomatic persons are potential 114 sources of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Furthermore , Pan et al . 23 , in a study on 82 SARS - CoV - 2 infected 115 patients , found c v values in the range of 10 8 – 10 9 RNA copies mL - 1 , also in the previous days and in 116 the first days of onset of the disease . Consequently , the concentrations of the viral load in the 117 .

There are 123 currently no values available in the scientific literature for c i for SARS - CoV - 2 . Watanabe et al . 27 124 estimated the infectious doses of several coronaviruses on the basis of data sets challenging 125 humans with virus HCoV - 229E ( known as an agent of human common cold ) and animals with 126 other viruses ( e . g . mice with MHV - 1 , considered as a surrogate of SARS - CoV - 1 ) . On the basis of the 127 orders of magnitude of the infectivity conversion factors for the overall data sets , we assumed a c i 128 range between 0 . 01 and 0 . 1 . 129 The quanta emission rate calculation was performed for four different emission profiles ( which are 130 adopted in the risk evaluations described later ) evaluated as a combination of expiratory activities 131 and activity levels : ( i ) oral breathing during resting ; ( ii ) oral breathing during heavy activity ; ( ii ) 132 speaking during light activity ; and ( iv ) singing ( or loudly speaking ) during light activity . 133 Quanta emission rates were calculated using eq . ( 1 ) and applying a Monte Carlo method 22 in order 134 to take into account for the possible variation of the input data . To this end , probability density 135 functions characteristics of each parameter were considered . In particular , we considered normal 136 distributions for : ( i ) the log - transformed c v data ( average and standard deviation of log 10 ( c v ) equal 137 to 8 and 0 . 7 log 10 ( RNA copies mL - 1 ) , respectively ) ; and ( ii ) the infectious dose c i ( average and 138 standard deviation equal to 0 . 025 and 0 . 125 , respectively ) . A distribution of quanta emission rates 139 ( ER q ) , was obtained as a result of application of the Monte Carlo method ( Figure 1 ) , i . e . the 140 probability density function of ER q ( pdf q ) . 141 .

The quanta concentration at time t , n ( t ) , 144 in an indoor environment is based on the quanta mass balance proposed by Gammaitoni and 145 Nucci 20 , and can be evaluated as : 146 147 (cid:14)(cid:9)(cid:15)(cid:11) (cid:3) (cid:9)(cid:10) (cid:0) ·(cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:10)(cid:10)·(cid:13) (cid:16) (cid:17)(cid:14) (cid:6) (cid:18) (cid:9)(cid:10) (cid:0) ·(cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:10)(cid:10) (cid:19) · (cid:14) (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)·(cid:7) (cid:13) ( quanta m - 3 ) ( 2 ) 148 where IVRR ( h - 1 ) represents the infectious virus removal rate in the space investigated , n 0 149 represents the initial number of quanta in the space , I is the number of infectious subjects , V is the 150 volume of the indoor environment considered , and ER q is the quanta emission rate ( quanta h - 1 ) for 151 the specific disease / virus under investigation . The quanta concentration calculation adopted here 152 is based on the following hypotheses : the quanta emission rate is considered to be constant , the 153 latent period of the disease is longer than the time scale of the model , and the droplets are 154 instantaneously and evenly distributed in the room 20 . The infectious virus removal rate is the sum 155 of three contributions 28 : the air exchange rate ( AER ) via ventilation , the particle deposition on 156 surfaces ( k , e . g . via gravitational settling ) , and the viral inactivation ( λ ) . The deposition rate was 157 evaluated as the ratio between the settling velocity of super - micrometric particles [ roughly 158 1 . 0 × 10 - 4 m s - 1 as measured by Chatoutsidou and Lazaridis 29 ] and the height of the emission 159 source ( 1 . 5 m ) ; thus , k was 0 . 24 h - 1 . The viral inactivation was evaluated on the basis of the SARS - 160 CoV - 2 half - life ( 1 . 1 h ) detected by van Doremalen et al . 3 , thus λ was 0 . 63 h - 1 . 161 In the exposure scenarios tested with the prospective and retrospective approaches , to take the 162 variability of the input parameters into account , the indoor quanta concentration n ( t ) was 163 determined through eq . ( 2 ) , applying a Monte Carlo method that adopted the probability density 164 functions ( pdf q ) characteristic of quanta emission rates ( ER q ) . Since the probability density 165 .

The relative frequency at which a certain quanta concentration occurred for each 170 time step of simulation , i . e . the probability density function of the quanta concentration ( pdf n ) , 171 was also obtained as result of the Monte Carlo simulations . 172 2 . 1 . 3 Evaluation of the dose of quanta received by an exposed susceptible subject 173 The dose of quanta received by a susceptible subject exposed to a certain quanta concentration , 174 n ( t ) , for a certain time interval , T , can be evaluated by integrating the quanta concentration over 175 time as : 176 177 (cid:10) (cid:0) (cid:3) (cid:6)(cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:14)(cid:9)(cid:15)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:15) (cid:15) (cid:6) ( quanta ) ( 3 ) 178 It can be concluded from Eq . ( 3 ) that the dose of quanta received by a susceptible subject is 179 affected by the inhalation rate ( IR ) and subsequently by their activity level . As an example , for the 180 same exposure scenario [ i . e . identical n ( t ) and T ] , the dose of quanta received by subjects 181 performing at a light activity level ( IR = 1 . 38 m 3 h - 1 ; e . g . slowly walking ) is more than double that 182 received by people just sitting or standing ( IR = 0 . 54 m 3 h - 1 ) . For the dose , in the exposure 183 scenarios described in this paper , the Monte Carlo method was applied to eq . ( 3 ) considering the 184 probability density function of the quanta concentration ( pdf n ) , whereas the IR was considered as 185 a constant value ; thus , the probability density function of the dose ( pdf D ) was obtained for each 186 time step of the simulation . 187 .

Several dose – response models are available in the scientific literature for 190 assessing the probability of infection of airborne - transmissible pathogens 16 , 17 , including 191 deterministic and stochastic models , and threshold and non - threshold models . 192 The best - suited dose – response models for airborne transmission of pathogens are the stochastic 193 models . In particular , exponential models have been mostly adopted in previous studies because 194 of their suitability and simplicity 27 . Such models consider the pathogens as discrete bundles ( i . e . 195 quanta ) distributed in a medium ( e . g . saliva / sputum ) in a random manner described by the 196 Poisson probability distribution . When the medium is aerosolized , the pathogen distribution in the 197 aerosols , and hence their distribution in the air , also follows the Poisson probability distribution . 198 The complex Poisson summation equations can be simplified in an exponential equation 17 , 27 , 30 , i . e . 199 the exponential dose – response model , which evaluates the probability of infection , P I ( % ) , of 200 susceptible people as : 201 202 (cid:20) (cid:12) (cid:3) 1 (cid:18) (cid:22) (cid:16)(cid:17) (cid:0) (cid:3) (cid:18) (cid:19) ( % ) ( 4 ) 203 For a unit dose of quanta ( D q = 1 ) , the probability of infection P I is equal to 63 % , from which 204 derives the definition of “quantum” as the “amount of infectious material to infect 1 - e - 1 ( i . e . 63 % ) 205 of the people in an enclosed space” 13 , 20 . 206 In the exponential dose – response model , the variation of host sensitivity to the pathogen is not 207 considered . More complex models , such as the Beta - Poisson probability distribution , could take 208 this factor into account 17 , 27 , 30 ; nonetheless , in the present paper the differences in the exposed 209 population in terms of susceptibility to the virus will not be considered . 210 .

( 4 ) , also applying a Monte Carlo method . To this end , the probability density functions 212 of the dose of quanta ( pdf D ) obtained as a result of the Monte Carlo simulation on D q were 213 considered ; thus , a probability density function of P I was also obtained ( pdf P ) . 214 The probability of infection represents the ratio between the number of infection cases ( C ) and 215 the number of exposed susceptibles ( S ) . In retrospective analyses of documented outbreaks , the 216 known C / S ratio is typically defined as the “attack rate” . 217 2 . 2 The individual infection risk and the basic reproduction number 218 As stated above , the probability of infection ( P I ) is the expected number of infection cases in 219 relation to the number of exposed susceptibles ( C / S ratio ) . However , based on eqs . ( 2 - 4 ) , such 220 probability is strongly influenced by the probability density function of the dose ( pdf D ) , which is 221 influenced in turn by the probability density function of the quanta concentration ( pdf n ) and by 222 the probability density function of the quanta emission rate ( pdf q ) . In other words , for a given 223 exposure scenario ( microenvironment , ventilation , inhalation rate of the exposed subject , etc . ) the 224 probability of infection ( P I ) can assume different values on the basis of the rate of quanta emitted 225 by the infected subject : the lower the quanta emission rates , the lower the probability of infection 226 ( since all the other parameters affecting the exposure were considered to be constant values ) . 227 Thus , when evaluating the individual risk ( R ) of an exposed person , we should know both the 228 probability of infection ( P I ) and the probability of occurrence of such a P I value ( P P ) . The latter is 229 defined by the probability density function pdf P . Since the probability of infection ( P I ) and the 230 probability of occurrence P P are independent events , the individual infection risk , R , can be 231 evaluated as the product of the two terms : 232 233 (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:20) (cid:12) · (cid:20) (cid:20) ( % ) ( 5 ) 234 .

The maximum value of R in eq . ( 5 ) , i . e . 238 the mode of the pdf R , is of particular interest because it represents the most probable individual 239 risk for a healthy subject or , in other words , the highest probability of being infected . In a 240 conservative application of the proposed approach to estimate and reduce the risk of individuals 241 being together with an infected individual in an indoor environment , the maximum individual 242 infection risk must be less than an acceptable risk . 243 The US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) typically uses a target reference risk range of 10 - 4 244 to 10 - 6 for carcinogens in drinking water 31 , which is in line with World Health Organization ( WHO ) 245 guidelines for drinking water quality , which base guideline values for genotoxic carcinogens on the 246 upper bound estimate of an excess lifetime cancer risk of 10 - 5 32 . If the estimated lifetime cancer 247 risk is lower than 10 - 6 , the risk is considered acceptable , while risks above 10 - 4 are considered 248 unacceptable 33 . 249 The choice of an acceptable contagion risk for SARS - CoV - 2 is difficult and certainly questionable . 250 However , considering the mortality rate of SARS - CoV - 2 , this turns out to be an order of magnitude 251 lower than the corresponding value associated with carcinogenic diseases . For this reason , only for 252 discussion purposes , the value of 10 - 3 is taken as an acceptable risk reference for SARS - CoV - 2 . 253 For the purpose of managing an epidemic and keeping the infection under control , it is also 254 important to estimate the basic reproduction number of the infection , R 0 , which is calculated as 255 the ratio between the number of susceptible people infected ( C ) and the infected subject ( I ) . Thus , 256 R 0 can be easily evaluated by multiplying the infection probability , P I , by the number of exposed 257 susceptible individuals ( S ) . To control an epidemic , the R 0 value must be less than 1 . Therefore , in 258 .

In particular , 264 four emission profiles of the infected subject 6 and corresponding profiles of the healthy subjects 265 exposed were chosen . For the sake of simplicity , the simulations were run assuming that the 266 susceptible subjects remained in the microenvironment for the same length of time as the 267 infected subject ( i . e . the two subjects enter and leave the environment under test together ) . Each 268 indoor environment under investigation was tested for three different values of air exchange rate 269 ( AER ) . Table 1 presents a detailed summary of the four different indoor exposure scenarios 270 considered to evaluate the risk of airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . Scenario A consists of a 271 hospital room of 100 m 3 where a resting infected patient emits quanta in the room through oral 272 breathing , whereas the exposed susceptible subjects consist of a member of the medical staff in a 273 light exercise activity ( scenario A - 1 ) and another patient at rest ( scenario A - 2 ) . In scenario B , the 274 infection affects two subjects , both oral breathing during a sports activity in a 300 m 3 gym . 275 Scenario C concerns two subjects ( infected and healthy ) in light activity while speaking in a generic 276 300 m 3 office ( bank , post office , supermarket , shop , etc . ) . Finally , scenario D represents an 277 infected subject singing or speaking loudly in an 800 m 3 room with healthy subjects listening at a 278 sedentary activity level . 279 Table 1 - Description of the exposure scenarios tested in the prospective assessment . 280 Scenario A Scenario B Scenario C Scenario D .

Here , an index 284 case patient traveled from the Chinese epidemic epicenter , Wuhan , on 23 January 2020 and ate 285 lunch in a restaurant in Guangzhou , China , with his family on 24 January 2020 ( family A , 10 people 286 sitting at the same table ) . Later that day , the index patient experienced onset of fever and cough 287 and SARS - CoV - 2 infection was diagnosed . On the following days , nine other people were 288 diagnosed with SARS - CoV - 2 infection : four members from family A’s table and five other people at 289 .

No other customers seated at other tables or waiters were 290 infected . 291 The restaurant is a 5 - floor building without windows ; each floor has its own air ventilation system . 292 The third floor dining area , at which the index patient ate lunch , has a floor area of 145 m 2 , with 293 15 tables arranged with a distance between each table of about 1 m . A total of 91 people ( 83 294 customers , 8 staff members ) were in the room during that lunch . The exposure time was variable 295 for the customers : those seated at tables close to the index patient had exposure times of 296 53 minutes ( family B ) and 73 minutes ( family C ) . The ventilation and air conditioning situation is 297 reported in Lu et al . 34 . Five fan coil air - conditioning units are installed in the room and there is no 298 outdoor air supply ; thus , the ventilation relies only upon infiltration and natural ventilation . The 299 authors performed computational fluid dynamics analyses and tracer gas decay tests to obtain 300 more information about the possible air - flow pathway in the room , and to determine the air 301 exchange rate expected during that lunch . The analyses performed showed that , due to the 302 particular installation and use of the fan coils , the room can be divided into different air - flow 303 zones , with well - mixed conditions . The air - flow zone involving the table at which the index patient 304 sat also included the two tables at which the other five infected people sat ; and covered an area 305 of roughly 45 m 3 . The tracer gas decay tests revealed a low air exchange rate ( mostly due to the 306 absence of an outdoor air supply ) in the range of 0 . 56 – 0 . 77 h - 1 . 307 Therefore , on the basis of the available information , the retrospective assessment was applied to 308 this outbreak case , through eqs .

This case 316 was recorded on 10 March , in Mount Vernon ( Skagit County , Washington State , USA ) . In a 810 m 3 317 hall , 61 choir members ( out of a total of 121 regular members ) gathered to rehearse , aware of the 318 practices for the containment of contagion ( frequent hand washing and social distancing ) . None of 319 the members that attended had evident symptoms of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . There was hand 320 sanitizer at the front door and members refrained from the usual hugs and handshakes ; each 321 person brought their own sheet music . The event lasted from 6 : 30 pm to 9 : 00 pm ( about 2 . 5 322 hours ) . Within few days , 33 of the 61 participants ( 53 % ) were diagnosed with SARS - CoV - 2 323 infection , at least three were hospitalized , and two died 35 . 324 As pointed out by Hamner et al . 35 , the 2 . 5 - hour singing practice could have provided several 325 opportunities for droplet and fomite transmission ( e . g . members sitting close to one another , 326 sharing snacks , and stacking chairs at the end of the practice ) . Nonetheless , the abovementioned 327 voluntary measures put in place would not support the documented spread of the contagion . On 328 the contrary , the act of singing , itself , might have contributed to transmission through emission of 329 aerosols , which is affected by loudness of vocalization 19 . This is even more relevant considering 330 that attack rate of 53 . 3 % ( based on 33 confirmed cases ) could represent a conservative estimate , 331 since other 20 probable cases were mentioned by Hamner et al . 35 . 332 As regard the heating and ventilating system , limited information is available : the Fellowship Hall 333 is heated by a relatively new commercial forced - air furnace with supply and return air grills 334 situated high on a single wall . The furnace is installed to have both make - up and combustion air , 335 but it is not known how much fresh air was provided on that evening . During the entire rehearsal 336 no exterior doors were open . We applied a retrospective assessment to the case of the Skagit 337 .

Results and Discussions 341 3 . 1 Statistics of quanta emission rates 342 Figure 1 and Table 2 show the statistics relating to the quanta emission rates for the four emission 343 profiles considered in section 2 . 1 . As shown in Buonanno et al . 19 , there are large differences 344 between the emission profiles . Obviously the lowest values are found under the oral breathing 345 condition during resting ( median value of 0 . 36 quanta h - 1 ) , followed by the oral breathing 346 condition during heavy activity as the inhalation rate increases ( 2 . 4 quanta h - 1 ) , and reaching 4 . 9 347 quanta h - 1 for the increase in aerosol emitted during vocalization 6 and , finally , peaking during 348 singing / speaking loudly ( 31 quanta h - 1 ) . Indeed , the rate of particle emission during normal human 349 speech is positively correlated with the amplitude of vocalization 36 . 350 The probability density functions of the quanta emission rates ( P q ) were also determined . In 351 particular , the log - transformed ER q values obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations resulted in a 352 normal distribution ( Shapiro - Wilk test , p < 0 . 01 ) . Table 2 shows the average and standard 353 deviation values of the log 10 ( ER q ) . 354 We point out that the estimated values present two main uncertainty contributions clearly related 355 to the limited data currently available for the SARS - CoV - 2 : i ) a still low number of experimental 356 data for the viral load in the mouth , c v , of SARS - CoV - 2 infected subjects , ii ) unavailable infectivity 357 conversion factors , c i , for SARS - CoV - 2 ; indeed , as mentioned in the methodology section , the c i 358 parameter was estimated on the basis of data available for other coronaviruses challenging 359 humans ( only in the case of HCoV - 229E ) and animals ( for all other types of coronavirus ) . 360 .

In particular , the trends of different percentiles are reported . The example 372 shows that a person singing / speaking loudly in such a microenvironment can lead to a median n ( t ) 373 value after 2 hours equal to 0 . 027 quanta h - 1 ( with a 5 th – 95 th percentile range of < 0 . 002 – 374 0 . 38 quanta h - 1 ) . Such concentrations lead to a median dose of quanta received by the subject 375 exposed for 2 h in a sedentary activity equal to 0 . 029 quanta ( with a 5 th – 95 th percentile range of 376 < 0 . 002 – 0 . 42 quanta ) , then resulting in a median probability of infection , P I , of 2 . 8 % ( with a 5 th – 377 95 th percentile range of 0 . 2 % – 33 . 0 % ) . Thus , if higher quanta emission rates are considered , the 378 indoor quanta concentrations and the consequent probability of infection can be more than 10 - 379 fold the median values . 380 381 382 1E - 5 1E - 4 1E - 3 1E - 2 1E - 1 1E + 0 1E + 1 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 n ( quanta m - 3 ) time ( min ) 1st 5th 25th 50th 75th 95th 99th 1E - 5 1E - 4 1E - 3 1E - 2 1E - 1 1E + 0 1E + 1 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 D q ( quanta ) time ( min ) 0 . 1 % 1 . 0 % 10 . 0 % 100 . 0 % 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 P I ( % ) time ( min ) a ) b ) c ) .

Different percentiles are reported . 385 In view of the application of a conservative approach that could be essential to reduce the risk of 386 contagion in indoor environments , using the highest quanta concentration and probability of 387 infection values can be misguiding . Indeed , the probability of occurrence of such high values is 388 extremely low . Thus , as described in section 2 . 2 , a proper evaluation of the individual infection risk 389 ( R ) can be obtained by applying eq . ( 4 ) , i . e . multiplying the probability of infection ( P I ) by the 390 corresponding probability of occurrence ( P P ) . In Figure 3 the probability density functions of 391 individual infection risk ( pdf R ) , probability of infection ( pdf P ) , quanta concentration ( pdf n ) , and 392 dose of quanta ( pdf D ) after 2 hours of exposure are reported ( in terms of R , P I , n and D q values for 393 each percentile ) for the illustrative example discussed above ( i . e . scenario D , AER = 0 . 5 h - 1 ) . The 394 individual infection risk ( R ) presents a maximum value ( R max ) at the 85 th percentile ( 2 . 2 % ) due to a 395 probability of infection P I = 14 . 5 % and a probability of occurrence P P = 15 % . In other words , the R 396 value at the 85 th percentile is the most probable individual infection risk for a healthy susceptible 397 subject ( i . e . , the one with the highest chance of occurring ) . Due to the similarity of the probability 398 density functions of the four expiration activities resulting from the calculation of the quanta 399 emission rates ( log 10 ( ER q ) reported in Table 2 ) , the pdf R for all the exposure scenarios tested here 400 was similar to that of the exposure scenario shown in Figure 3 ( i . e . the R max value occurs in the 401 narrow range of 84 th – 90 th percentile ) . 402 Furthermore , as discussed in section 2 . 2 , the probability density function of the probability of 403 infection ( pdf P ) is mostly influenced by the probability density function of the quanta emission rate 404 ( pdf q ) when moving backwards in the four - step approach ; indeed , once the exposure scenario is 405 defined , all the parameters contributing to the calculation of P I ( ventilation , room volume , subject 406 .

Thus , for a simplified estimate of R max , the 407 simplest calculation can be applied ( instead of the Monte Carlo method ) by just adopting the 85 th 408 percentile of the quanta emission rate in the four - step calculation using eqs . ( 2 - 4 ) . 409 410 Figure 3 – Probability density functions of individual infection risk , probability of infection , quanta 411 concentration , and dose of quanta at t = 120 min for the illustrative example reported in Figure 2 ( exposure 412 scenario A with an air exchange rate of 0 . 5 h - 1 ) . The probability density functions are reported as quanta 413 concentration ( n ) , dose of quanta ( D q ) , probability of infection ( P I ) , and individual infection risk ( R ) for each 414 percentile . The maximum individual infection risk ( R max ) is 1 . 9 % and occurs at the 85 th percentile 415 ( P I = 14 . 5 % , P q = 15 % ) . 416 3 . 2 . 2 Estimate of the maximum individual risk versus exposure time in indoor environments 417 Figure 4 and Table 3 show the results of the Monte Carlo simulations for the four exposure 418 scenarios analyzed . The exposure time – risk relationships reported in Figure 4 are essential as they 419 can be used by choosing either the exposure time or the maximum risk R max as the independent 420 variable . In the first case , knowing the exposure time of the healthy subject in the environment in 421 question , the corresponding individual infection risk can be evaluated and then compared to an 422 1E - 04 1E - 03 1E - 02 1E - 01 1E + 00 1E + 01 0 . 01 % 0 . 10 % 1 . 00 % 10 . 00 % 100 . 00 % 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 D q ( qu an ta ) , n ( quanta m - 3 ) R , P I ( % ) i - th percentile R PI n Dq .

In the second case , once an acceptable infection risk has been imposed , 423 the corresponding maximum exposure time value can be easily assessed . The four scenarios are 424 examined assuming an acceptable risk value of 10 - 3 as discussed in section 2 . 3 . Since the maximum 425 value of individual risk occurs roughly at the 90 th percentile , the corresponding probability of 426 occurrence of the risk ( P P ) is 10 % ; thus , an acceptable individual infection risk of 10 - 3 will roughly 427 correspond to a probability of infection of P I = 1 % . For indoor environments characterized by high 428 crowding indexes a P I < 1 % is essential as it can assure a R 0 < 1 when crowded with up to 100 429 people . Therefore , assuring an individual infection risk of 10 - 3 also guarantees the control of the 430 epidemic with an R 0 < 1 for a maximum number of exposed healthy people S < 100 . 431 For the exposure scenario discussed above ( scenario D , AER = 0 . 5 h - 1 ) the maximum exposure time 432 to reach an accepted risk of R = 10 - 3 is very short ( 16 min ) ; this is due to the high viral load emitted 433 during singing or speaking loudly leading to high quanta concentrations despite the large volume 434 available . Obviously , the exposure time can increase with higher ventilation rates , e . g . reaching 435 38 min in the case of mechanical ventilation at 10 h - 1 . The crowding index of such an indoor 436 environment ( 800 m 3 ) ranges from 0 . 75 m 2 ( auditorium ) to 2 m 2 ( conference room ) per person 37 ; 437 thus , for a room height of 4 m a corresponding floor area of 200 m 2 will be available , then 438 resulting in a total number of people simultaneously present in the room ( S ) ranging from 100 439 ( conference room ) to 267 ( auditorium ) . Therefore , after 16 min of exposure in the case of natural 440 ventilation ( or 38 min in the case of mechanical ventilation with AER = 10 h - 1 ) , the value of R 0 will 441 be higher ( auditorium ) or equal ( conference room ) to 1 . Thus , in the management of the 442 epidemic , reducing the crowding index could be essential . Accepting higher R max values would 443 clearly increase the maximum exposure time ; indeed , in the case of R max = 10 - 2 , the exposure time 444 values would be 62 min and 392 min , for an AER equal to 0 . 5 h - 1 and 10 h - 1 , respectively .

The simultaneous reduction of both the quanta emission rate and the volume 449 compared to scenario D makes the maximum exposure times for an acceptable infection risk of 10 - 450 3 comparable to the previous case ( 15 min and 36 min for ventilation of 0 . 5 h - 1 and 10 h - 1 , 451 respectively ) . Additionally , in this case , the estimated exposure times would guarantee an R 0 < 1 452 with S < 100 subjects . 453 454 .

Finally , in exposure scenario B ( the gym with infected and 467 healthy subjects during heavy activity with oral breathing ) , although there is no vocalization in the 468 subject ' s activity , the high inhalation rate produces considerable ER q values , then increasing the 469 individual risk ; thus , in order to guarantee an acceptable infection risk of 10 - 3 the maximum 470 exposure times resulted quite short , i . e . 14 min and 29 min for 0 . 5 h - 1 and 10 h - 1 , respectively . 471 Thus , for all the scenarios investigated , the ventilation conditions strongly influence the risk ( or 472 the exposure time ) of the exposed subject : this difference increases as the accepted risk increases 473 as shown in the trends presented in Figure 4 . In contrast , if a lower risk was accepted ( i . e . 10 - 4 or 474 10 - 5 ) , increasing the air exchange rate is not leading to the significant reduction of the risk , and 475 local exhaust ventilation would be more effective . 476 Table 3 – Maximum exposure time ( min ) for the different exposure scenarios to reach an acceptable 477 maximum individual infection risk ( R max ) . 478 Exposure scenarios AER ( h - 1 ) Maximum individual infection risk ( R max ) 1×10 - 1 1×10 - 2 1×10 - 3 1×10 - 4 1×10 - 5 Scenario A - 1 - Hospital room Emitting subject : patient Exposed subject : Medical staff 0 . 5 2797 212 36 10 3 3 . 0 7968 600 56 11 3 10 . 0 22430 1727 157 17 3 Scenario A - 2 - Hospital room Emitting subject : patient Exposed subject : patient 0 . 5 8039 597 72 17 5 3 . 0 21739 1678 159 21 5 10 . 0 64333 4671 455 46 6 Scenario B – Gym Emitting subject : Exercising person 0 . 5 519 55 14 4 1 3 . 0 1500 110 16 4 1 .

The retrospective analysis applied to the restaurant in Guangzhou ( Figure 5a ) revealed that , 483 under the boundary conditions considered in the simulation ( in terms of room volume , ventilation , 484 number of exposed people ; see section 2 . 4 . 1 ) , a probability of infection ( P I ) after 1 hour of 485 exposure equal to the attack rate ( 45 % ) can be reached for a quanta emission rate of 486 ER q = 61 quanta h - 1 . This emission rate , for an emitting subject speaking during light exercise , 487 occurs at the 93 rd percentile of the probability density function of ER q ( P q ) . 488 Similarly , for the retrospective analysis applied to the Skagit Valley choir ( Figure 5b ) , in order to 489 reach an attack rate of 53 % after 2 . 5 hours of exposure under the simulation boundary conditions 490 reported in section 2 . 4 . 2 , a quanta emission rate of 341 quanta h - 1 is needed . Additionally , in this 491 case , such an emission rate occurs at the 92 nd percentile of the probability density function ( P q ) of 492 an infected subject while singing . 493 Therefore , for both the analyzed cases in the retrospective analyses , the required ER q values to 494 obtain the documented R e fall perfectly within the possible values of the emission profiles under 495 consideration ( i . e . speaking and singing / speaking loudly in light activity reported in Table 2 ) . 496 .

Indeed , the R values 498 for the restaurant at Guangzhou and the Skagit Valley choir were 3 . 2 % and 3 . 7 % , respectively – 499 more than one order of magnitude higher than the acceptable risk of 10 - 3 . In these two cases , an 500 individual risk of < 10 - 3 would have been obtained with a probability of infection P I = 1 . 3 - 1 . 4 % : 501 such a P I is not actually achievable by varying and optimizing the room ventilation ( e . g . 502 AER > 100 h - 1 would be required ) , and is achievable only by reducing the exposure time of the 503 susceptible subjects and the quanta emission rates . 504 505 Figure 5 – Quanta concentration ( n ) and probability of infection ( P I ) evaluated for the retrospective cases 506 applied at the documented outbreaks at ( a ) the restaurant in Guangzhou and ( b ) the Skagit Valley choir . 507 To summarize , the retrospective assessment of the two SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks investigated 508 demonstrate that the documented number of infected people can be explained by means of the 509 airborne transmission route ; indeed , the most probable of the expected events occurred . The 510 approach and consequent calculation reported here clearly highlights that the explanation of such 511 a high number of infected people does not necessarily require the presence of a superspreader in 512 the environment ( i . e . an infected person with the highest viral load , c v , and infectious dose , c i ) , but 513 0 % 10 % 20 % 30 % 40 % 50 % 60 % 70 % 80 % 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 0 30 60 90 120 150 P I ( % ) n ( quanta m - 3 ) time ( min ) n PI 0 % 10 % 20 % 30 % 40 % 50 % 60 % 70 % 80 % 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 0 20 40 60 P I ( % ) n ( quanta m - 3 ) time ( min ) n PI a ) b ) .
