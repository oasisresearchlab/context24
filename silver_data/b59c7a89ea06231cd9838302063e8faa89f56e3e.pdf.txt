Blanke 1 , 2 , 4 ✉ Helicobacter pylori ( Hp ) secrete VacA , a diffusible pore - forming exotoxin that is epidemiologically linked to gastric disease in humans . In vitro studies indicate that VacA modulates gastric epithelial and immune cells , but the in vivo contributions of VacA as an important determinant of Hp colonization and chronic infection remain poorly understood . To identify perturbations in the stomachs of C57BL / 6 or BALB / C mice that result specifically from extended VacA exposure , we evaluated the efficacy of administering purified toxin using automated infusion via surgically - implanted , intragastric catheters . At 3 and 30 days of interrupted infusion , VacA was detected in association with gastric glands . In contrast to previously - reported tissue damage resulting from short term exposure to Hp extracts administered by oral gavage , extended infusion of VacA did not damage stomach , esophageal , intestinal , or liver tissue . However , several alterations previously reported during Hp infection were detected in animals infused with VacA , including reduction of the gastric mucus layer , and increased vacuolation of parietal cells . VacA infusion invoked an immune response , as indicated by the detection of circulating VacA antibodies . These foundational studies support the use of VacA infusion for identifying gastric alterations that are unambiguously attributable to long - term exposure to toxin . Helicobacter pylori ( Hp ) chronically infects half the world’s population , and is a major risk factor for the develop - ment of gastric ulcer disease and cancer 1 – 3 . Hp transmission and colonization , which occur at a high rate during early childhood 4 – 8 , results in a protracted inflammatory microenvironment within the infected glands of the stomach 9 . However , because subjects are often unaware of their infection status until the emergence of clinical disease , relatively little is known about the natural history of Hp infection over extended periods of time , includ - ing the contributions of individual virulence factors to bacterial persistence and disease progression . The vacuolating cytotoxin ( VacA ) is the only known exotoxin secreted by Hp 10 , 11 . Although most Hp strains harbor the gene encoding VacA ( vacA ) , extensive human epidemiological data indicate that Hp strains with alleles encoding VacA with high cytotoxic activity in vitro , are associated with increased severity of gastric dis - ease 12 – 15 . In murine models , VacA is an important determinant of colonization 16 – 19 and persistence 16 . Cell cul - ture models have provided elegant insights into the consequences of VacA intoxication of epithelial cells , which include mitochondrial dysfunction and disruption of metabolic homeostasis 20 , 21 , the biogenesis of large intra - cellular vacuoles 22 – 24 , and , at higher concentrations , death by several distinct mechanisms 25 – 35 . However , under - standing these in vitro observations in the context of chronic Hp infection has been challenging , in part , because the biodistribution of VacA in the stomachs of Hp - infected individuals is poorly understood . As a diffusible toxin within the extracellular environment , VacA can presumably access gastric cells both directly at and distal to the site of Hp colonization . However , proximal and distal effects of VacA within the stomach are likely to be different , based , in part , on the concentration gradient of toxin established by the diffusion of following secretion into the extracellular environment . Notably , higher concentrations of VacA are required for toxin - dependent cell death , 1 Department of Pathobiology , College of Veterinary Medicine , University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , Urbana , Illinois , 61801 , USA . 2 Department of Microbiology , School of Molecular and Cellular Biology , University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , Urbana , Illinois , 61801 , USA . 3 Department of Veterinary Clinical Medicine , College of Veterinary Medicine , University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , Urbana , Illinois , 61801 , USA . 4 Carle Illinois College of Medicine , University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , Urbana , Illinois , 61801 , USA . ✉ e - mail : sblanke @ illinois . edu open 2 Scientific RepoRtS | ( 2020 ) 10 : 9307 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 020 - 65787 - 3 www . nature . com / scientificreports www . nature . com / scientificreports / than for toxin - mediated vacuole biogenesis or disruption of metabolic homeostasis 20 , 21 , 36 . In addition , at the site of Hp microcolony formation , VacA cellular activity is antagonized by CagA , an Hp effector injected directly into host cells via type IV secretion 37 – 44 . Previous in vivo studies of VacA action have involved the administration of a single or several doses of VacA - containing Hp extracts by oral gavage into mice , resulting in damage to gastric tissue , including loss of gland architecture , erosion , ulceration of the gastric epithelium , and infiltration of inflammatory cells within the lamina propria 45 – 49 . Although straightforward , delivery of toxin by oral gavage does not faithfully recapitulate gas - tric exposure to VacA during chronic Hp infection , in part , because the perpetual emptying of stomach contents pre - empts the study of chronic toxin exposure 50 , 51 . With the goal of overcoming this limitation , we assessed the efficacy of intragastric infusion to administer VacA , for extended and uninterrupted periods of time , directly into the stomach lumen of C57BL / 6 and BALB / C mice . Results Intragastric catheter implantation . The in vivo consequences of long - term exposure to VacA , which is secreted by Hp into the extracellular environment as a diffusible exotoxin during infection , are poorly under - stood . In this study , we examined the efficacy of infusing toxin , for periods of 3 or 30 days , into the stomachs of 5 – 6 week old , male and female C57BL / 6 mice , which have been used as an animal model for studying Hp infec - tion biology 52 – 55 . Prior to infusion , a sterile catheter ( Fig . S1 ) was surgically implanted into the stomach of each animal , and attached to the forestomach serosa ( Fig . S2 ) . The free end of the catheter was tunneled under the skin and exteriorized on the back of the mouse , just caudal to the neck , providing a direct , unobstructed access port to the stomach ( Fig . S2 ) . Following surgical catheter - implantation , animals were evaluated once every 2 h for the first 12 h , and then , once every 12 h for 2 weeks . Immediately following surgery , all animals exhibited visible and quantifiable stress , as indicated by a loss in body weight ( Fig . 1a ) and behavioral changes associated with pain ( sickness behavior ) , including visible alterations in movement , grooming , and responses to stimuli ( Fig . 1b ) . However , all behavioral modifications resolved within 5 days after surgery , and within 10 days , all animals had regained their original body weight . Based on these results , a two - week convalescent period between surgery and the commencement of infusion studies was adopted as standard practice . Intragastric infusion of VacA . C57BL / 6 mice were administered , by gastric infusion , either purified VacA in saline solution , or saline solution alone ( as the vehicle control ) , both of which had undergone acid - activation , as described under Materials and Methods . Infusion lines connected Luer ports , that had been surgically placed on the dorsum of each animal , to closed reservoirs containing the infusion solution ( Fig . S3 ) . Toxin prepara - tions were refreshed within the infusion reservoirs every 24 h . Preliminary observations revealed that , after 1 day within closed infusion reservoirs , VacA retained greater than 50 % of the toxin’s cellular activity ( as meas - ured by neutral red uptake ) , and between 25 – 50 % of the toxin’s original cellular activity after 7 days . Because Figure 1 . Post - surgical monitoring of animals following intragastric catheter implantation . ( a , b ) For the first 12 h following surgical catheter implantation , C57BL / 6 mice were monitored every 2 h for ( a ) body weight and ( b ) pain on a scale of 0 – 10 ( as evaluated by diminished mobility , grooming , and response to stimuli ) , and then thereafter every 12 h for 2 weeks . The data were combined from three independent surgical cohorts ( n = 3 ) , each performed in triplicate ( 9 animals total ) . Error bars represent standard error of the mean . ( c ) 2 weeks after surgical implantation of intragastric catheters , animals were euthanized , tissues were collected , paraffin embedded , and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) . The site of catheter placement into the forestomach was observed by light microscopy imaging of a cross - sectional , 5 μ m thick section . Images are representative of three independent surgical cohorts ( n = 3 ) each performed in triplicate ( 9 animals total ) . 3 Scientific RepoRtS | ( 2020 ) 10 : 9307 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 020 - 65787 - 3 www . nature . com / scientificreports www . nature . com / scientificreports / earlier papers had reported extensive and rapid gastric damage to the mice of mice administered single doses of VacA - containing bacterial extracts , we did not know prior to beginning these studies whether mice would toler - ate long - term , uninterrupted toxin infusion . Rather than risk the unnecessary use of animals to establish a dose response curve for an untested system , we chose instead to examine a single concentration of toxin ( 500 nM ) , which under in vitro conditions , robustly causes cellular changes , including vacuolation , mitochondrial dysfunc - tion , and autophagy induction 20 , 21 , 31 , 36 , 56 – 60 . The volume of toxin or vehicle infused was controlled by a peristaltic pump interfaced with a dedicated computer ( Fig . S4 ) . The infusion lines were situated to allow animals unimpeded movement , but without the opportunity to interfere with the tubing . VacA or saline vehicle was infused at rates and frequencies estimated to maintain approximately 95 % or 50 % gastric capacities for 3 - day and 30 - day periods , which we refer to as short - or long - term exposures , respectively ( Table 1 ) . At the end of each infusion period , animals were euthanized by CO 2 asphyxiation , followed by cervical dislocation . During the course of this study , none of the animals demonstrated detectable signs of stress or sickness . Moreover , system failures , such as leaks within the infusion lines , pump malfunctions , etc . , were not encountered . Detection of VacA within the stomachs of toxin - infused animals . The spatial and temporal dynam - ics of VacA distribution within the stomach during Hp infection are poorly understood . However , we speculated that the dispersal of this secreted , diffusible toxin is likely to mirror the gastric niche colonized by Hp . Studies of Hp biogeography within the stomachs of infected rodents 61 – 68 have revealed partitioning of the bacteria as free - swimming bacteria within the gastric mucus , microcolonies on the surface of gastric tissue , and microcol - onies associated with epithelial cells that line the stomach glands . Adopting a strategy of administering VacA by intragastric infusion , was based largely on the premise that the toxin delivered into the stomach lumen would diffuse and interact with gastric tissue and glands prior to emptying of gastric contents . Immunohistofluorescence ( IHF ) imaging of gastric tissue sections collected from animals infused with VacA , but not from animals infused with the vehicle control , revealed detectable green fluorescence , corresponding to VacA , extending from the lumi - nal side of the epithelium into the gastric glands ( Fig . 2 ) . These results support a conclusion that at least a portion of VacA , administered into the stomach lumen of catheterized mice , had accessed the gastric glands within the gastric mucosa . In future studies , we will characterize the bio - distribution and concentration of VacA within dis - crete locations in the upper GI , including the lumen , antrum , corpus , duodenum , and esophagus . Gross gastric damage is not detected in response to infused VacA . Earlier studies indicated that introduction of Hp extracts to the stomachs of mice by oral gavage caused damage to gastric tissue 45 – 49 . To address whether gross damage to gastric tissue also results from VacA administration by intragastric infusion , C57BL / 6 mice were infused with either purified VacA ( 500 nM ) or saline vehicle . Unexpectedly , analysis of H & E stained gastric tissue revealed an absence of gross damage associated with mice that had been infused with VacA for either 3 or 30 days ( Fig . 3a ) , similar to tissue collected from mice that had been infused with saline vehicle . The overall glandular structure was not markedly altered , as indicated by a regular alignment of basal - to - apical gastric epithelial cells ( Fig . 3a ) . We did not observe an influx of inflammatory immune cells that would normally accom - pany tissue damage ( Fig . 3a ) , although using IHF imaging , there was a very modest increase in monocyte - derived cells ( CD68 + cells ) in animals exposed to VacA ( Fig . 3b , c ) , consistent with the idea that VacA alone is not suf - ficient to elicit the localized inflammatory response characteristic of Hp - gastric infection . These data suggest that the substantial alterations and damage that had been previously reported in the gastric tissue of animals with short - term exposure to VacA - containing Hp extracts administered by oral gavage 45 – 49 , were not specifically attributable to VacA . infusion b target stomach capacity c experimental endpoint d initial bolus e initial bolus administration time f re - infusion volume g re - infusion adminitration time h interval between re - infusions i short - term 95 % 12h 200 µ l 5 min 50 µ l 1 min 30 min 1 day 3 days long - term 50 % 5 days 100 µ l 1 min 50 µ l 1 min 45 min 15 days 30 days Table 1 .

Vacuolation of parietal cells , which was one of the earli - est phenotypes associated with VacA function in vivo 46 , 49 , is synonymous with dysfunction , resulting in decreased acid production 69 . Within gastric tissue from mice infused with VacA for 3 days , we observed the presence of vacuolar structures within the cytosol of parietal cells , which were visible as areas of high pallor ( Fig . 4a , b ) . These results are consistent with earlier reports that vacuolar - like structures were reported in damaged gastric tissue of mice that had received Hp extracts 46 , 49 . Parietal cell vacuolation was also clearly visible in tissue prepared from animals infused for 30 days with VacA , although not so evident in animals infused with saline ( Fig . 4a ) . These observations were consistent with higher vacuolation scores within the tissue of animals administered VacA than those infused with saline ( Fig . 4b ) , although the differences were not statistically significant . Notably , several studies have shown that Hp can inhibit acid secretion by downregulating H + / K + ATPase expression in parietal cells 70 , 71 , and that Hp - dependent inhibition of acid production in isolated parietal cells has been associated with VacA production 72 . Although we did not examine whether toxin - dependent vacuolation of parietal cells was associated with decreased acid production in these studies , the presence of vacuolar structures can be an indica - tion of secretory dysfunction . VacA - dependent reduction in gastric mucus . Another important secretory function associated with gastric glands is the generation of gastric mucus , which is secreted by neck cells in the apical portion of the mucosa . In addition to shielding the surface of the gastric epithelium from the degradative stomach lumen , the thick gastric mucus likely functions as a barrier to Hp infection by inhibiting Hp penetration into the deeper recesses of the gastric glands , which would be expected to serve as a protective colonization niche . To evaluate if exposure to VacA affects the gastric mucus layer , stomach tissue from C57BL / 6 mice infused with either purified VacA ( 500 nM ) or saline vehicle was stained red with Periodic Acid Schiff ( PAS ) for detection of mucopolysac - charides , neutral mucins , and glycoproteins 73 . In order to control for variability between tissue section thickness , Figure 2 . Detection of VacA in mouse tissue . Two weeks after surgical implantation of intragastric catheters , C57BL / 6 mice were infused with saline or VacA ( 500 nM in saline ) for , as indicated , either 3 days ( target gastric capacity filled to 95 % ; referred to as short - term exposure ) , or 30 days ( target gastric capacity filled to 50 % ; referred to as long - term exposure ) . Animals were immediately euthanized upon completion of each infusion , and tissues were collected , fixed , and paraffin embedded . Sections of the stomach were cut to 5 μ m in thickness and stained for IHF imaging , using rabbit anti - VacA antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated secondary antibodies , Alexa Fluor 647 - conjugated wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ; stains mucus granules of gastric surface mucus - producing cells ) , and DAPI ( which stains nuclei ) . Images are representative of three independent infusion cohorts ( n = 3 ) , each performed in triplicate ( 9 animals total ) . 5 Scientific RepoRtS | ( 2020 ) 10 : 9307 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 020 - 65787 - 3 www . nature . com / scientificreports www . nature . com / scientificreports / the amount of PAS staining material was normalized to the depth of the gastric mucosa , measured as the distance between the luminal and basal sides of the tissue slice . These studies revealed visibly ( Fig . 5a ) and quantitatively ( Fig . 5b – d ) less PAS - staining in gastric tissues collected from mice that had been infused with VacA , as compared to mice infused with saline vehicle . To further validate our findings , gastric tissue sections that had been incubated with Alexa Fluor 647 - labeled wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) , which stains mucus granules of gastric surface mucus - producing cells 74 , were examined by confocal microscopy . Although tissue sections of approximately equivalent depth were analyzed , the WGA signal was normalized to the DAPI signal as an internal staining control . These experiments revealed visibly ( Fig . 5b ) and quantitatively ( Fig . 5e ) less fluorescence signal , corresponding to WGA , within gastric tis - sue from mice infused with VacA than animals infused with vehicle control . These data are consistent with an interpretation that VacA is sufficient to cause reduction of the gastric mucus layer , and suggest that VacA may modulate the function of mucus - producing neck cells . Indeed , in vitro studies have demonstrated that infection with VacA - producing strains of Hp results in the inhibition of mucin synthesis and secretion 75 . VacA - dependent in vivo gastric alterations extend beyond C57BL / 6 mice . All of the studies described above were conducted using C57BL / 6 mice . To evaluate whether VacA - dependent alterations in the stomachs of infused animals extend beyond C57BL / 6 mice , we examined the effects of short - and long - term VacA exposure in BALB / c mice , which have also been used to investigate Hp infection biology 53 , 76 . Similar to results described above for experiments conducted with C57BL / 6 mice , intragastric infusion of purified VacA to BALB / c Figure 3 . IHF analyses of gastric tissue from VacA - infused mice . Two weeks after surgical implantation of intragastric catheters , C57BL / 6 mice were infused with saline or VacA ( 500 nM in saline ) , as indicated , for either 3 days ( target gastric capacity filled to 95 % ; referred to as short - term exposure ) , or 30 days ( target gastric capacity filled to 50 % ; referred to as long - term exposure ) . Animals were immediately euthanized upon completion of each infusion , and tissues were collected , fixed , and paraffin - embedded .

Images in ( a ) and ( b ) are representative of those collected from three independent infusion cohorts ( n = 3 ) each performed in triplicate ( 9 animals total ) . ( c ) Data from studies described in ( b ) were quantified by comparing green fluorescence emission , corresponding to cell surface CD68 + , between gastric tissue collected from mock - and VacA - infused animals .

Statistical significance was determined at an alpha level of 0 . 05 , using a 2 - tailed paired t - test . 6 Scientific RepoRtS | ( 2020 ) 10 : 9307 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 020 - 65787 - 3 www . nature . com / scientificreports www . nature . com / scientificreports / mice for either 3 or 30 days revealed the absence of gross damage or infiltration of inflammatory immune cells within gastric tissue ( Fig . 3 ) . Moreover , VacA - dependent vacuolation of parietal cells was visible in BALB / c mice ( Fig . 4b ) , similar to that observed in C57BL / 6 mice . Long - term exposure to VacA does not result in detectable intestinal pathology . Because gastric contents are emptied from the stomach into the small intestine , we speculated that a portion of infused VacA might enter the intestinal tract during gastric emptying . To evaluate potential “downstream” consequences of VacA , we histologically analyzed entire intestinal tracts , prepared as “Swiss - Rolls” 77 ( Fig . 6a ) , from C57BL / 6 or BALB / C mice that had been infused with either purified VacA ( 500 nM ) or saline vehicle . Comparative analyses of H & E stained tissue , collected from animals exposed to either VacA or saline solution , revealed that there were not differences in villus and crypt lengths within the duodenum ( Fig . 6b , c ) and ileum ( Fig . 6f , g ) . Within the jejunum , villi lengths were modestly ( but significantly ) shorter in tissue collected from C57BL / 6 mice and BALB / c mice infused with VacA , relative to animals infused with saline solution ( Fig . 6d , e ) . Villus atrophy has been associated with a variety of conditions , including infections with rotavirus 78 , HIV and microsporidia 79 , and Giardia 80 . To our knowledge , Hp - associated intestinal villus shortening has not been previously reported , and it’s not clear whether the observed phenomenon is a direct or systemic host response to the action of infused VacA . Extended , uninterrupted exposure to VacA does not result in detectable esophageal pathology . Although mice and other rodents lack an emetic reflex due to both anatomic ( poor diaphragm musculature ) and neurogenic ( decreased phrenic nerve activity ) restrictions 81 , we were concerned that potential overfilling of the stomach during infusion might result in retrograde leakage of toxin from the stomach back into the esopha - gus , possibly resulting in esophageal damage . However , analysis of H & E stained esophageal tissue from animals infused with VacA indicated that the esophagi did not appear distended , the muscularis mucosa was intact and not enlarged , and gross abnormalities were not detected within the esophageal serosa ( Fig . S5 ) . The stratified squamous epithelium was the expected 5 – 7 layers thick , and , an appropriate layer of keratinized surface material was observed . The absence of observable alterations in esophageal tissue suggest that retrograde spillover of toxin from the stomach into the esophagus was minimal or absent . Intragastric VacA infusion does not result in extra - gastric pathology within liver , kidney , pan - creas , or lungs . Microscopic imaging of H & E stained tissue from livers of C57BL / 6 mice revealed that infu - sion of VacA ( 500 nM ) for either 3 or 30 days did not result in detectable structural changes or pathology to the hepatic architecture ( Fig . S6a ) . Visible differences were also not detected between kidney , pancreatic , or lung tissues collected from animals administered either VacA or saline vehicle ( Fig . S6b – e ) . Intragastric administration of VacA accompanies increased splenic activity . Microscopic imaging of H & E stained splenic tissue revealed that gastric infusion of VacA ( 500 nM ) resulted in an expansion of lym - phocytes , as indicated by increased presence of dark staining nuclei in the splenic white pulp ( Fig . 7a , b ) . Within Figure 4 . Vacuolation of parietal cells within gastric tissue from VacA - infused animals .

Animals were immediately euthanized upon completion of each infusion , and tissues were collected , fixed , and paraffin - embedded . Gastric sections ( 5 μ m in thickness ) were prepared from VacA - and saline mock - infused animals ( 3 different cohorts , each containing 3 animals , for a total of 9 animals from both VacA - and mock - infused animals ) by cutting along the greater curvature of the stomach , and then evaluated qualitatively ( a ) and quantitatively ( b ) for relative parietal cell vacuolation . ( a ) Representative light microscopy images of gastric tissue , with black arrows designating examples of intracellular vacuoles . ( b ) Data from the images described in part ( a ) were quantified on a scale from 0 – 4 ( vacuolation in 0 % of parietal cells ( 0 ) , < 25 % ( 1 ) , 25 – 50 % ( 2 ) , 50 – 75 % ( 3 ) , or > 75 % ( 4 ) of the gastric mucosa ) .

Error bars represent standard error of the mean . 7 Scientific RepoRtS | ( 2020 ) 10 : 9307 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 020 - 65787 - 3 www . nature . com / scientificreports www . nature . com / scientificreports / animals administered saline , we speculate that the increased splenic immune cell infiltrate at 30 days , relative to 3 days , reflect normal immune system maturation as mice age . IHF imaging revealed expansion of CD68 + cells , indicating an influx of monocytes and / or monocytic - derived cells ( Fig . 7c , d ) . Intragastric VacA infusion stimulates a humoral response . To evaluate whether intragastric infusion of VacA induced an adaptive humoral response , serum was collected from C57BL / 6 mice that had been adminis - tered either VacA ( 500 nM ) or the saline vehicle control . These studies revealed detectable IgG and IgM antibod - ies that were immuno - reactive against purified VacA in the sera of 7 of the 9 animals that had been infused with purified toxin for 30 - days ( but not 3 days ) ( Fig . 7e ) . These findings indicated that intragastric infusion of purified VacA resulted in a humoral response in most of the animals . Figure 5 . Gastric mucus within gastric tissue from VacA - infused animals .

The sections were evaluated ( a ) qualitatively for PAS staining , which stains mucus in tissue , by light microscopy imaging , and , ( c ) quantitatively by normalizing the distance of PAS staining from the apical surface of each section relative to ( d ) the total apical - to - basolateral mucosa depth .

However , unmasking the exact functional contributions of individual virulence factors to the colonization , survival , and dissemination of microbes during in vivo infection remains a challenge in the field of bacterial pathogenesis . This is especially true for secreted and diffusible bacterial exotoxins that can intoxicate host cells both proximal and distal to the immediate site of bacterial colonization within the host 82 . The most direct approach for experimentally evaluating the role of secreted bacterial toxins is to administer the toxin directly to the host , in the absence of infection . However , in vivo administration of toxins cannot always faithfully replicate infection conditions . For example , intestinal loop models used to study enteric toxins lack the normal motility and circulatory functions of the intestine 83 . Intravenous administration of toxins may not always accu - rately reflect the toxin dispersal and bio - distribution routes that normally occur during infection 84 . Finally , the use of single - dose toxin administration , for studying the outcome of acute intoxication , may not provide insights into the consequences of extended toxin exposure during chronic infection .

Two weeks after surgical implantation of intragastric catheters , C57BL / 6 mice were infused with either saline or VacA ( 500 nM in saline ) for either 3 days ( target gastric capacity filled to 95 % ; referred to as short - term exposure ) , or , 30 days ( target gastric capacity filled to 50 % ; referred to as long - term exposure ) . Animals were immediately euthanized upon completion of each infusion , and tissues were collected , fixed , and paraffin - embedded . Sections of the ( a , c ) spleen were cut to 5 μ m in thickness and stained with ( a ) hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) or ( c ) stained for CD68 using indirect immunofluorescence with Alexa - 488 conjugated secondary antibodies , and , DAPI which stains nuclei as a surrogate for cell number , for IHF imaging . Immune cell infiltration into the ( b ) splenic parenchyma was quantified by ( b ) digitally measuring the percentage of the spleen stained with nuclei , or , ( d ) the area of CD68 fluorescence area relative to the area of DAPI staining . ( e ) Purified VacA was immunoblotted using the sera from either 30 day saline or VacA infused mice as a primary antibody , with either anti - mouse IgG or IgM as a secondary antibody . Asterisks indicate nonspecific binding of the IgM antibody . Images are representative of three independent infusion cohorts ( n = 3 ) each performed in triplicate . Statistical significance was determined at an alpha level of 0 . 05 with pairwise comparisons of saline and VacA infused animals within a single timepoint with a 2 - tailed paired t - test .

In vivo infusion of bacterial toxins has been previously employed , perhaps most frequently for the administration of toxin - based therapeutics 85 – 87 . To experimentally examine the effects of acute toxin exposure in the absence of infection , investigators have used intraperitoneal 88 , intravenous 89 , and intestinal infusion 90 , usually for a period of several hours or less . In contrast , the 30 - day infu - sion period described here provides a more realistic opportunity to study the consequences of protracted expo - sure to VacA . To our knowledge , intra - gastric infusion has not been previously used to introduce bacterial toxins into the gastrointestinal tract . An important premise of administering VacA by infusion into the stomach lumen was that the toxin must diffuse and interact with gastric epithelial tissue . Although the bioavailability of VacA during Hp gastric infec - tion in vivo remains poorly understood , the distribution of VacA within the stomach should reflect the complex “biogeography” of Hp at and within gastric glands of infected mice . Congruent with this prediction , we detected VacA associated with the surface epithelium lining the stomach glands of the apical mucosa ( Fig . 2 ) , validating that VacA , when infused into the stomach lumen , navigates the thick mucus layer to access the gastric epithelium . Future work will be required to fully characterize the repertoire of cell types within individual glands that are tar - geted by VacA . Notably , a recent study reported the low - level and transient association of VacA with myeloid cells in mice administered toxin by oral gavage , suggesting that at least a portion of VacA within the gastric mucosa may access the lamina propria 16 . These findings are consistent with a large body of work indicating that VacA interacts with and modulates both epithelial and non - epithelial cells 9 , 10 , 91 . The bioavailability of VacA within the gastric environment during Hp infection is poorly understood , but is likely shaped by several factors , including regulation of VacA expression , and secretion of mature toxin to access the extracellular environment during infection . Several studies have indicated that high salt concentrations within the extracellular environment increase both transcription of vacA 92 as well the levels of VacA within the exoproteome of Hp 93 , a finding that may be germane to the association between high salt diets and increased stomach cancer risk . In addition , exotoxin diffusion is increasingly being recognized as an important determinant of concentration - dependent modulation of the infection microenvironment 94 . The findings here that infused VacA interacts with gastric tissue and modulates several gastric functions previously associated with Hp infection , provides the framework for future studies to establish dose - dependent and cell - type specific alterations attrib - utable uniquely to VacA . Indeed , we are particularly interested in examining potential VacA - dependent gastric alterations at toxin concentrations lower than those at which cell death is observed . In our in vitro studies , we have noted VacA dependent alterations , including vacuolation , mTORC1 inhibition , and autophagy induction at concentrations 10 – 100 fold - lower than those required for cell death . This work will ultimately be most informa - tive when complemented by parallel efforts to define the in vivo distribution and availability of VacA during Hp infection . Strikingly , our studies here did not reveal the gross tissue damage that had been earlier reported in mice that had received , by oral gavage , boluses of VacA - containing Hp extracts 45 – 47 , 49 We speculate that the toxin prepara - tions used in earlier studies may have included pro - inflammatory components not present in our VacA prepa - rations , such as lipopolysaccharide , urease , and the neutrophil activating protein ( NAP ) . Even in the absence of tissue damage , our data indicated that infused VacA was sufficient to induce a humoral immune response , con - sistent with previous reports that oral immunization of mice with purified VacA protected animals from infection with cytotoxin producing strains of Hp 45 , 95 . While gross damage was not detected within VacA - infused animals , several gastric alterations previously associated with Hp infection were detected , including a significant reduction in the gastric mucus layer ( Fig . 5 ) . Notably , a decrease in gastric mucus in animals infected with Hp 64 , 96 or orally gavaged with Hp extracts 46 had been earlier reported . Because our studies revealed infused VacA associated with glands at the apical side of the gastric mucosa , which is enriched with mucus - secreting neck cells , we conjecture that VacA may directly mod - ulate mucus production by intoxication of these cells . A prominent consequence of VacA cellular intoxication is an overall reduction in host cell biosynthetic metabolism , resulting from toxin - mediated mitochondrial dys - function 20 , 21 , 31 , 36 , 97 , 98 . The resulting depletion in cellular energy is sensed by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) 21 , resulting in a global cellular shift to catabolic metabolism . Because mTORC1 directly regulates protein translation , we speculate that pruning of the gastric mucus layer during Hp infection may result from VacA - dependent attenuation of mucin biosynthesis , which would be consistent with previous work sug - gesting that mucin synthesis is affected during Hp infection , rather than mucin secretion and release into the extracellular milieu 99 . Although the ramifications of VacA - dependent inhibition of gastric mucus are not clearly understood , one possibility is that thinning of the mucus layer may promote deeper penetration of bacteria into the gastric glands as a privileged colonization site . We also observed parietal cell vacuolation exclusively in animals infused with purified VacA . Reduction in stomach acidity , or hypochlorhydria , is a hallmark of chronic human infection with toxigenic strains of Hp , and is associated with Hp gastric disease 100 , 101 , and eradication of Hp infection restores normal parietal cell ultrastruc - ture and function 102 , 103 . In animal models , VacA - dependent parietal cell dysfunction and loss of acid production has been reported in isolated gastric glands from mice 102 and guinea pigs 104 . While the implications of VacA tar - geting of parietal cells are not fully understood , reduced acidity of the stomach is likely to promote chronic gastric infection of Hp , which are not acidophilic . While the studies described here focused on VacA - dependent alterations of the gastric epithelium , future work will also examine immune cell modulation in the stomachs of mice administered toxin by intragastric infusion . In vitro studies have revealed that VacA targets and alters the function of immune cells , and in particular myeloid cells and T lymphocytes 105 . VacA - mediated Interference with T cell activation occurs by both channel - dependent and - independent mechanisms 106 . Future studies to evaluate whether these two independent mechanisms also exist in vivo will be facilitated by gastric infusion of mutant forms of VacA lacking membrane channel activity . 11 Scientific RepoRtS | ( 2020 ) 10 : 9307 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 020 - 65787 - 3 www . nature . com / scientificreports www . nature . com / scientificreports / In summary , results from these studies support the efficacy of intragastric infusion for studying the effects of extended , uninterrupted administration of VacA into the stomachs of mice . Notably , VacA - dependent gastric alterations were manifested early ( after only 3 days of infusion ) , and were generally maintained , as some effects remained after 30 days of infusion . Extended studies throughout the different life stages of experimental animals ( i . e . adolescence , sexually mature , socially mature , aged , etc . ) , will be required to fully understand the dynamics , longevity , and reversibility of VacA - dependent modulation of the gastric environment . Notably , intragastric infu - sion is scalable to accommodate higher numbers of animals , as well as other small rodent species . In addition , the programmable interface bestows a high degree of flexibility for examining a broad array of alterations resulting from VacA exposure in vivo , including dose - dependent , toxin - specific modifications to host cell transcriptomes and proteomes , as well as cell - specific responses to chronic VacA exposure . Materials and Methods Animal care . All experiments involving the use of live vertebrate animals were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals , and , with the approval of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( Protocol # 15239 ) . C57BL / 6 mice , bred in - house , and BALB / C mice ( purchased from Jackson Laboratory , Bar Harbor ME ) , were housed in a climate - controlled ( 23 °C , 55 % humidity ) , animal care unit with a 12 h : 12 h light : dark cycle . Animals were fed a standard commercial rodent diet ( Envigo , Indianapolis , IN ) and allowed access to food and water ab libitum . C57BL / 6 mice were sibling - mated in trios ( 2 females and 1 male ) , and the pups were weaned at 22 days of age . Experimental procedures were commenced when animals were 5 – 6 weeks old . After surgical placement of the intragastric catheter , animals were housed singly for the duration of the studies . Analgesia . Mice were administered pre - operative analgesia of carprofen ( 5 mg / kg ; Zoetis , NJ ) , buprenor - phine ( 0 . 05 mg / kg ; Par Pharmaceuticals , NJ ) , and cefazolin ( 20 mg / kg ; West - Ward Pharmaceutical , TN ) . Animals were also administered post - operative analgesia of buprenorphine ( 0 . 05 mg / kg ) , 2 and 24 h after surgery . All medications were dispensed subcutaneously on the right flank of each animal . Surgical placement of intragastric catheter . Following the induction and maintenance of anesthesia with isoflurane ( 5 % induction , 1 . 5 % maintenance , in 100 % O 2 , Henry Schein , NY ) , the ventral abdomen , left thorax , and dorsal cervical area of mice were aseptically prepared for surgery . To each animal in dorsal recum - bency , a midline celiotomy ( 1 cm ) was performed just caudal to the xiphoid process . The stomach was gently exteriorized from the abdominal cavity using DeBakey forceps . Pre - sterilized polyurethane intragastric cathe - ters were custom - ordered ( 8 cm long , 0 . 6 mm inner diameter , 1 . 0 mm outer diameter ; Norfolk Medical , Access Technologies , Skokie Illinois ) with an unattached 23 G , 0 . 5” blunt Luer needle , and were passed through a 0 . 75 cm diameter polyethylene terephthalate ( Dacron ) suture disk , and positioned 0 . 5 cm from the distal end of the slit valves . The catheters were inserted into the greater curvature of the forestomach by puncturing the gastric serosa with a 29 G 3 . 5” spinal needle ( BD Biosciences , NJ ) within the catheter and were adhered to the gastric serosa by application of a single drop ( ~ 10 µ L ) of sterile internal cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive ( GLUture , Norfolk Medical , Skokie Illinois ) to the suture disk . The free - end of the intragastric catheter was passed through and then adhered to the body wall with a 14 G I . V . catheter ( BD Biosciences ) using sterile cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive applied onto the suture disc . Subsequent to exteriorization of the free end of the intragastric catheter from the left subcutane - ous space to the dorsal cervical region , all incisions were closed with 5 – 0polyclactin suture on a taper point needle ( Ethicon , Sommerville , NJ ) . The external intragastric catheter was connected to a Luer port , capped , and secured to the dorsal skin by 2 – 3 simple interrupted sutures . Post - surgical monitoring . Mice were monitored for body weight and pain every 2 h for the first 12 h fol - lowing surgery , and then every 12 h for the ensuing 2 – 3 weeks . Pain was assessed on a 0 – 10 scale ( 0 = no pain , 10 = severe pain ) by assessing for normal mouse behavior ( movement , grooming , piloerection , posture , eye position ) , and surgery - related stressors ( dehiscence , inflammation , infection ) . Purification of VacA . Helicobacter pylori ( Hp ) 60190 ( cag PAI + , vacA s1 / m1 ; ATCC 49503 ) was cultured in bisulfite / sulfite - free Brucella ( BSFB ) broth ( 4 mL , 0 . 5 % NaCl , 0 . 2 % β - cyclodextrin , 0 . 1 % dextrose ( all from Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) , and , 1 % peptone , 1 % tryptone , and 0 . 2 % yeast extract ( all from BD Bacto , NJ ) , overlaid on 2 % agar plates made of Ham’s F - 12 medium ( Sigma - Aldrich ) supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) ) , and incubated in a microaerophilic environment ( 10 % O 2 , 5 % CO 2 ) . After 48 h , the liquid culture phase was collected as a starter culture , and diluted 1 : 100 in fresh BSFB ( final 2 L ) supplemented with 5 µ g / mL vancomycin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and incubated on a shaker platform in a humidified , microaerophilic ( 10 % O 2 , 5 % CO 2 ) , 37 °C incubator . After 48 h , Hp cultures were centrifuged ( 5 , 000 × g , 4 °C , 30 min ) , the super - natants were collected , and VacA was precipitated by adding solid ammonium sulfate ( Fisher Scientific ) to 90 % saturation ( 662 g / L ) at 4 °C with constant stirring . After 4 h , the precipitated material was collected by centrifuga - tion ( 5 , 000 × g , 4 °C , 30 min ) and dissolved in “wash buffer” ( 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , pH 7 . 0 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , and then dialyzed at 4 °C in the wash buffer ( 200 times the volume of the precipitate solution ) , with four buffer changes spanning 12 h , using 50 kDa molecular weight cutoff ( MWCO ) dialysis tubing ( Spectra / Por 6 RC , Spectrum Labs , City , ST ) . The dialyzed solution was cleared of any remaining insoluble material by centrifugation ( 5 , 000 × g , 4 °C , 30 min ) , and the supernatant was further cleared by filtration using a 0 . 22 μ M MWCO filtration funnel ( Stericup , EMD Millipore , City , ST ) . The VacA - containing soluble fraction was loaded onto an anion exchange column ( DEAE Sephacel , GE healthcare , City , ST ) pre - equilibrated with wash buffer . After washing the column with 3 bed volumes of wash buffer , VacA was eluted from the resin with wash buffer supplemented with 0 . 2 M NaCl and collected in 1 mL fractions . The purity of VacA within each fraction was assessed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie Staining ( G - 250 Coomassie Brilliant Blue ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . Fractions containing VacA without additional visible 12 Scientific RepoRtS | ( 2020 ) 10 : 9307 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 020 - 65787 - 3 www . nature . com / scientificreports www . nature . com / scientificreports / protein bands were combined and dialyzed for 12 h ( with 4 buffer changes ) at 4 °C in saline ( 0 . 9 % NaCl , at 200 times the volume of the purified VacA ) , using 50 kDa MWCO dialysis tubing . Following dialysis , purified VacA was filter - sterilized using a 0 . 22 μ m pore syringe filter , aliquoted into single use vials , and stored at − 20 °C . The total protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) assay ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The presence of VacA was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using rabbit VacA antiserum that was generated in - house with New Zealand white rabbits , as described below under “Polyclonal VacA antibody production” . Acid activation of VacA . Immediately prior to infusion , VacA was activated by mixing 10 % ( v / v ) HCl ( 0 . 3 M ) to purified toxin , and then incubated at 37 °C , as described 107 . After 30 min , the solution was neutralized by adding NaOH ( 0 . 3 M ) at an equivalent volume as the HCl added , and diluted to the final infusion concentra - tion with sterile saline ( 0 . 9 % NaCl ) . Polyclonal VacA antibody production . Animal usage was conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals , and , was approved by the IACUC at the University of Illinois , Urbana - Champaign ( Protocol # 15019 ) . Two female New Zealand white rabbits ( 10 – 12 weeks old ; KBL ( NZW ) Charles River , Wilmington MA ) were co - housed within a climate - controlled ( 23 °C , 55 % humidity ) University of Illinois animal care unit with a 12 h : 12 h light : dark cycle . Animals were fed a standard commercial rabbit diet ( Envigo , Indianapolis , IN ) and allowed access to food and water ab libitum . For immu - nization and blood collection , animals were sedated with acepromazine ( 1 mg / kg ) . Animals were immunized with purified VacA ( 1 mL , 0 . 5 mg / mL ) , in a 1 : 1 v / v emulsion with the adjuvant Titer Max Gold ( Sigma Aldrich ) , by subcutaneous injection at 5 separate sites on the haunches of the animals . Three secondary immunizations , consisting of purified VacA ( 1 mL , 0 . 5 mg / mL ) in a 1 : 1 v / v emulsion with incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant ( Thermo Fisher ) , were given at 2 - week intervals . Three booster immunizations , consisting of purified VacA ( 1 mL , 0 . 5 mg / mL ) in a 1 : 1 v / v emulsion with incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant , were given at 3 - week intervals , beginning 3 weeks after beginning serum collections . Following a titer test bleed conducted 5 weeks after the primary immunization , production bleeds were conducted every 2 weeks . Production bleeds of no more than 1 % of the animal’s weight of whole blood were collected from the central ear artery into serum - separating vacutainers ( BD Biosciences , NJ ) . After 19 weeks , a terminal cardiac blood collection was performed while animals were anesthetized under ketamine ( Med Vet International , Mettawa , IL ) ( 50 mg / kg ) and xylazine ( Sigma Aldrich ) ( 10 mg / kg ) anesthesia , followed by euthanasia with pentobarbital ( 100 mg / kg ) . Whole blood was incubated at 4 °C for 24 h , then cen - trifuged ( 1 , 500 xg ) at 4 °C . After 15 min of centrifugation , serum supernatants were pooled , and sodium azide ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was added to a final concentration of 0 . 05 % , and aliquots were stored at − 20 °C . Antibody titers were evaluated by immunoblotting purified VacA with the anti - VacA sera . SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . Purified VacA protein was denatured using 2X Laemmli sample buffer ( Bio - Rad , CA ) supplemented with 10 % β – mercaptoethanol ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , boiled , and resolved using SDS - PAGE . VacA was visualized after staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue . For immunoblotting , proteins were electro - transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF , Biorad ) membranes , probed with anti - VacA polyclonal primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) conjugated secondary antibodies ( Cell Signaling , MA ) and visualized by chemiluminescence ( SuperSignal West Femto / Pico Maximum Sensitivity Substrate ; ThermoFisher ) . Images were acquired using a ChemiDoc XRS + system ( Bio - Rad ) and data were processed with ImageLab soft - ware ( Bio - Rad , version 4 . 1 , NJ ) . Intragastric infusion . Following recovery from surgery , mice were connected to infusion line tubing via the dorsally - placed Luer port ( Fig . S2 ) . Infusion solutions were drawn from sterile , 25 mL reservoirs , and delivered to mice through polyurethane and silicone tubing using a peristaltic pump ( BT100 - 2J , Langer Instruments ) . For these studies , both purified VacA and the vehicle control were acid activated Short - term infusions were con - ducted for three days , and consisted of an initial bolus administered at 40 μ L / min for 5 min , and then afterwards dispensed every 30 min for a duration of 1 min , and at a rate of 40 μ L / min . Long - term infusions were conducted for thirty days , and consisted of an initial bolus administered at 100 μ L / min for 1 min , and then dispensed after - wards every 45 min for a duration of 1 min , and at a rate of 50 μ L / min . Every 24 h during an infusion series , imme - diately following a scheduled re - infusion administration , the system was paused , the lines were disconnected , and residual toxin was drawn out of the lines and reservoir using positive pressure . The reservoirs were filled , the lines were primed with fresh toxin , and the system was restarted ( < 5 min exchange time ) . At the completion of each infusion period , the infusion system was stopped and the lines were disconnected , and animals were placed in a separate clean cage for CO 2 asphyxiation , with death confirmed by cervical dislocation . Detection of VacA antibodies within mouse sera . Following immunoblotting of purified VacA , full - lane length PVDF membranes were incubated in a 1 : 1000 dilution of sera collected from infusion animals overnight at 4 °C . After primary antibody incubation , the membranes were washed with 0 . 1 % TBS - T , and incu - bated in either anti - mouse IgG or IgM , conjugated to HRP ( IgG - HRP : Cell Signaling Technology ; IgM - HRP : Thermo Fisher ) . Full blots were visualized simultaneously by incubating each blot in equal concentrations of chemiluminescence substrate ( SuperSignal West Femto / Pico Maximum Sensitivity Substrate ; ThermoFisher ) . Images in each experimental replicate were acquired together under identical exposure conditions using a ChemiDoc XRS + system ( Bio - Rad ) , and data were processed with ImageLab software ( Bio - Rad , version 4 . 1 , NJ ) . Paraffin embedded tissue processing . The stomach , intestines , esophagus , spleen , and liver were col - lected from euthanized animals and immediately fixed in Bouin’s fixative ( 15 : 5 : 1 saturated picric acid ( Sigma ) : 40 % formalin ( Sigma ) in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer : glacial acetic acid ( Fisher Scientific ) ) at room temperature for 4 h . The intestines were prepared from the proximal duodenum to the distal ileum , using the “Swiss Roll” 13 Scientific RepoRtS | ( 2020 ) 10 : 9307 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 020 - 65787 - 3 www . nature . com / scientificreports www . nature . com / scientificreports / method 77 , 108 . Following extensive washing in PBS pH 7 . 4 , all tissues were paraffin embedded , and tissue sections were cut to 5 – 7 μ m thick using a microtome ( Leica RM 2255 rotary microtome , Germany ) , and then applied to microscope slides with a positively charged surface coating ( Globe Scientific , NJ ) . The slides were dried overnight at 37 °C , and stored at room temperature . H & E and PAS staining . Paraffin - embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized and stained in Gills 1 hema - toxylin ( Sigma ) and Eosin ( Sigma ) , or PAS ( EM Biosciences , PA ) , and counterstained in Mayer’s hematoxylin ( Sigma ) . Stained slides were mounted in CytoSeal mounting medium ( Thermo Fisher ) , a coverslip was added , and the slides were allowed to dry . Slides were imaged by light microscopy , digitized by scanning ( NanoZoomer , Hamamatsu , Japan ) , and analyzed using the NDP . view2 software ( Hamamatsu ) . Fluorescence microscopy . Paraffin - embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized and hydrated with tap water . Heat - induced antigen retrieval was performed by incubating slides in citrate antigen retrieval buffer ( 10 mM sodium citrate , 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 , pH 6 . 0 ) at 100 °C . After 20 min , the slides were allowed to cool to room temperature , rinsed with Tris buffered saline ( TBS ; 50 mM Tris - Cl , 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 5 ) , and then per - meabilized by incubating the presence of in 0 . 25 % TritonX - 100 in TBS at room temperature . After 10 min , the slides were blocked by incubating at room temperature in the presence of 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in SeaBlock blocking buffer ( Thermo Fisher ) . After 60 min , the slides were then incubated at 4 °C in the presence of primary antibody ( the specific antibody was diluted in 1 % BSA in TBS , as indicated for each specific experiment ) . After overnight incubation , slides were rinsed with TBS and subsequently incubated in Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibody diluted in 1 % BSA / TBS at room temperature . After 60 min , slides were rinsed with TBS and incubated in DAPI ( 0 . 5 µ g / ml DAPI in PBS ) at room temperature . After 15 min , slides were washed with TBS , mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent ( Thermo Fisher ) , and sealed with a coverslip . All fluores - cently stained tissues were imaged using a Nikon A1 laser confocal microscope . Images were deconvoluted using AutoQuantX , with the fixed point - spread function ( PSF ) ( non - blind ) theoretical PSF program , consisting of a total of 20 iterations with 20 intervals and the noise level set to low ( 2 ) . Statistical analysis . All infusions were performed using three independent replicate blocks , with three rep - licate animals per block . Data were tested for normality using a Shapiro - Wilk normality test . Datasets that failed to reject the null hypothesis ( P value > 0 . 05 ) were analyzed by a parametric Student’s t - test for pairwise compari - sons . Datasets that rejected the null hypothesis ( P value < 0 . 05 ) were analyzed by a nonparametric Student’s t - test for pairwise comparisons . For pairwise comparisons , significance was determined using a 2 - tailed distribution , paired t test . For multiple comparisons , significance was determined using a one - way ANOVA with the Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons . Unless otherwise indicated , statistical significance was signified by an alpha level threshold of 0 . 05 . Error bars represent standard error of the mean ( SEM ) . Graphpad Prism ( version 6 . 01 ) was used for all statistical analyses . Received : 22 November 2019 ; Accepted : 4 May 2020 ; Published : xx xx xxxx References 1 . Wu , C . Y . et al .
