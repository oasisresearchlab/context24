the ratio of tangential to normal stiffness , k t / k n , determines the response ( Fig . 3a ) , which becomes nearly universal for large k t / k n . A spring network model ( Fig . 3b ) with m ¼ 1 ( similar to the models studied in refs 21 – 25 ) can be used to estimate the elastic moduli in the teardrop domain . Using a criterion proposed in ref . 20 , a crossover from a single peak to two peaks is predicted at k t = k n < 0 : 3 ; in agreement with our numerical ﬁndings ( Fig . 3a ) . We note that , in practice , the expected value of k t / k n for realistic granular matter should satisfy 2 / 3 , k t / k n , 1 ( this follows from the Cattaneo – Mindlin model 26 for the contact of elastic spheres ) , which is well above the threshold for obtaining one peak . Here , unless otherwise noted , we use k t / k n ¼ 0 . 8 . The reduced anisotropy ( for sufﬁciently large k t / k n ) is due to the horizontal projections of the static frictional forces , which compensate for the lack of normal contact forces , and can prevent the opening of horizontal contacts 27 , as indicated by the extended linear range in the presence of friction ( Fig . 1d ) . In other words , static friction acts to retain an ‘effective connectivity’ between the grains when the horizontal contacts are open ( as inside the teardrop ) , and render the system more isotropic than one would have anticipated in the absence of friction ( but not exactly isotropic ) . Hence , for sufﬁciently large m ( and realistic k t / k n ) , the response is single - peaked . On the other hand , when m is small ( or F ext large ) , sliding occurs , which increases the anisotropy and leads to a crossover to a two - peaked response . This crossover is shown as a function of F ext ( for m ¼ 0 . 2 ) in Fig . 1b , and as a function of m ( for F ext ¼ 15 mg ) in Fig . 3c . Polydisperse systems ( with a uniform distribution of radii in the interval [ R 2 d · R , R ] ) , where d is a measure of the polydispersity , and R denotes the maximal particle radius , exhibit qualitatively similar behaviour to that described above . The main difference is that the range of values of F ext for which the response is linear in F ext , as well as the range of F ext for which a single peak is obtained , decreases with increasing polydispersity , see Fig . 4a . Because the disorder in these systems induces ﬂuctuations ( which are not present in ordered systems ) , the results presented in Fig . 4a were smoothed by a convolution with a gaussian in the horizontal ( x ) direction : 1 ﬃﬃﬃ p p w e 2 ð x = w Þ 2 with w ¼ 6 R ; and averaged over several realizations of the disorder ( typically ﬁve ) . Our results on the effect of F ext , m and the degree of polydispersity on the crossover are summarized in a schematic phase diagram , Fig . 4b . The diagram enables us to interpret several recent experi - mental studies of the response of granular materials to a localized force 8 – 12 , 16 , 18 ; different experiments correspond to different regions in this diagram . A single - peaked response was observed in experi - ments on disordered three - dimensional ( 3D ) packings 15 , 17 with small applied forces ( a few times the particle weight ) , whereas multiple peaks were observed in experiments on ordered 3D packings 10 , where forces of a few thousand times the particle weight were applied . These peaks faded away for deeper systems . Experi - ments in 2D systems using photoelastic particles typically use a rather large applied force ( F ext < 150 mg in refs 8 , 9 ) , required to obtain a signiﬁcant photoelastic effect . The interparticle forces in the nominally ordered case are reproduced qualitatively even with frictionless particles 17 ; however , the introduction of friction improves this agreement to an essentially quantitative level .

The mechanical properties of soft biological tissues are essential to their physiological function and cannot easily be duplicated by synthetic materials . Unlike simple polymer gels , many biological materials— including blood vessels 1 , mesentery tissue 2 , lung parenchyma 3 , cornea 4 and blood clots 5 — stiffen as they are strained , thereby preventing large deformations that could threaten tissue integrity . The molecular structures and design letters to nature NATURE | VOL 435 | 12 MAY 2005 | www . nature . com / nature 191 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group principles responsible for this nonlinear elasticity are unknown . Here we report a molecular theory that accounts for strain - stiffening in a range of molecularly distinct gels formed from cytoskeletal and extracellular proteins and that reveals universal stress – strain relations at low to intermediate strains . The input to this theory is the force – extension curve for individual semi - ﬂexible ﬁlaments and the assumptions that biological networks composed of these ﬁlaments are homogeneous , isotropic , and that they strain uniformly . This theory shows that systems of ﬁlamentous proteins arranged in an open crosslinked mesh invariably stiffen at low strains without requiring a speciﬁc architecture or multiple elements with different intrinsic stiffness . The ﬁlamentous architectures of two representative strain - stiffening networks—namely , neuronal intermediate ﬁlaments ( the major cytoskeletal element of axons ) and ﬁbrin protoﬁbrils ( the fundamental polymers forming blood clots ) —are shown in Fig . 1 . These networks have large solvent - ﬁlled spaces , and their ﬁlaments are only gently curved between points of intersection . Stiffness , quantiﬁed by the shear moduli of a variety of biopolymer networks , is plotted as a function of applied strain in Fig . 2 . Other studies have reported similar strain - stiffening in crosslinked actin 6 , 7 , keratin 8 and cytoplasmic gels 6 . The systems that we consider vary over orders of magnitude in stiffness and in the strains they tolerate : neuroﬁlament networks can be deformed over 400 % before failing , whereas actin networks rupture at strains of 20 % . The response of a single elastic ﬁlament to an applied force has been the subject of much study 9 – 15 . This force - response is domi - nated by entropy : because there are many curled - up conﬁgurations and only one that is perfectly straight , stretching a ﬂexible ﬁlament reduces its conformational entropy and thus produces an opposing force . The ensuing elastic behaviour of semiﬂexible polymers is inherently nonlinear , as even modest strains pull the constituent ﬁlaments nearly straight , in marked contrast with conventional rubbers 16 . Polymer theory distinguishes three types of ﬁlaments , character - ized by two length scales : the persistence length l p ( the typical length scale for the decay of tangent – tangent correlations ) and the contour length L c . A ﬁlament is considered ﬂexible when l p , , L c , and rigid when the opposite holds . Completely ﬂexible ﬁlaments exhibit a purely entropic elastic response , whereas rigid ﬁlaments display no entropic elasticity . Most biologically relevant ﬁlaments are in a third intermediate category : semiﬂexible ﬁlaments with l p and L c of comparable magnitude . These ﬁlaments do not form loops and knots , yet they are sufﬁciently ﬂexible to have signiﬁcant thermal bending ﬂuctuations . In networks , the relevant contour length is the distance between network junction points or crosslinks , which we also call L c below . A theory for the force - response of such semiﬂexible ﬁlaments and the corresponding network shear modulus has been proposed 12 . This model is based on an energy functional of the form E ¼ ð L c 0 d z k 2 j u 00 j 2 þ f 2 j u 0 j 2 (cid:2) (cid:3) ð 1 Þ where z is the projected coordinate along the end - to - end vector , k is the bending stiffness ( related to the persistence length as k ¼ k B T l p ) and f is the applied force . u ( z ) describes the deviation of the ﬁlament from its straight conformation . The length L ¼ L ( f ; L c ) of the end - to - end vector is calculated to harmonic order in u ( z ) using the equipartition theorem 17 and the geometric relation between con - tour length and u ( z ) . The result is most conveniently expressed in terms of the scaled difference between the extension at force f and that at zero force d ~ L ¼ L ð f ; L c Þ 2 L ð 0 ; L c Þ L 2c = l p ¼ 1 p 2 X 1 n ¼ 1 J n 2 ð n 2 þ J Þ ð 2 Þ where J ¼ f L 2c = kp 2 is a dimensionless force ( see the inset to Fig . 3 ) . The scaling force k p 2 = L 2 c is the threshold force for the Euler buckling instability in thin cylinders 18 , 19 . Equation ( 2 ) can be inverted to yield a force – extension relation that , like the worm - like chain model applied to DNA 9 – 11 , diverges as f , ð L 2 L c Þ 2 2 as L ! L c . To get from the force – extension curve of single ﬁlaments to the Figure 2 Dynamic shear storage moduli measured at different strain amplitudes for a series of crosslinked biopolymer networks . The real part , G 0 , of the storage modulus reduces to the shear modulus G at zero frequency . Data shown are G 0 ( at 10rads 2 1 ) values for F - actin , ﬁbrin , collagen , vimentin and polyacrylamide , and shear modulus G for ﬁbrin and neuroﬁlaments , plotted as a function of the dimensionless strain g . Dynamic shear moduli were measured in a strain - controlled rheometer ( RFS - II , Rheometrics ) , which applies a sinusoidally varying strain with controllable maximal strain amplitude and computes the elastic storage moduli from the amplitude and phase shift of the resulting stress . Dataanalysisintheproprietarysoftwareassumesthatthestressresponseisalsoa sinusoidalfunction , butin thenonlinearrangeofstrainsthis relationship is notstrictly true and the resulting stress function deviates from a sinusoid by having a sharper peak at maximal stress . To determine if this complication perturbs the reported strain - stiffening results , we alsocomputed G bymeasuringstress atconstantlyincreasingstrains byusing the steady rate function of the RFS - II , which imposes a constant increase in strain ( 5 % s 2 1 ) and reports the resulting stress at very small strain increments ( , 0 . 1 % ) . The steady strain data overlap those from an oscillatory measurement of G 0 for the same sample of ﬁbrin , verifying that oscillatory measurements accurately report the magnitude of strain stiffening under the conditions of our experiments .

We consider a model isotropic network in which pairs of crosslink points ( nodes ) are connected by links composed of independent semi - ﬂexible ﬁlaments . We assume that no torques are exerted at nodes so that ﬁlaments stretch or compress but do not bend in response to forces . We also assume that the network is sufﬁciently random that the ﬁlaments are isotropically distributed in the absence of stress . We allow for a distribution of end - to - end separations between nodes , with an average equal to L ( f ¼ 0 ; L c ) , where L ð f ¼ 0 ; L c Þ ¼ L c ð 1 2 L c = 6 l p Þ is the equilibrium end - to - end length of a polymer segment with a total contour length L c . In response to external stresses , network nodes will displace and ﬁlaments will stretch or compress , that is , the network will strain . Under strain , the position R 0 a of node a in the unstrained network will transform to a new position R a ¼ L ~ a R 0 a where L ~ a is the local ( not necessarily symmetric ) Cauchy deformation tensor . In random networks such as those we consider , L ~ a will in general depend on a , that is , deformations will be non - afﬁne . We make the simplifying assumption that deformations are afﬁne , and take L ~ a ¼ L ~ inde - pendent of a . Although there is no a priori reason to believe the afﬁne approximation is valid , recent theoretical and experimental studies suggest that it is a good approximation for densely cross - linked ﬁlaments of high molecular weight 20 – 22 . As all forces are transmitted by links , and the force on each link is determined by its length , we can calculate the nonlinear stress tensor by averaging the force per area exerted by a single link over all magnitudes and directions of r . The result is j Tij ¼ r det L ~ f ðj L ~ r jÞð L il r l Þð L jk r k Þ j L ~ r j (cid:4) (cid:5) P ð r Þ where r is the number of links per unit volume and the average is over the probability distribution P ( r ) for separations r . This stress tensor measures the force per unit area of the deformed sample and is symmetric . We consider only the volume - conserving simple shear defor - mation produced in standard rheometers characterized by : L ~ ¼ 1 0 g 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 BB @ 1 CCA In this case , the shear modulus is related to the xz - component of the stress tensor via G ð g Þ ¼ j xz ð g Þ = g . To evaluate the shear modulus , we specify the bond probability distribution and force law f ( L ) . The simplest model is one in which f ( L ) is determined byequation ( 2 ) and the distribution function sets the distance between all nodes equal to the relaxed end - to - end length L ( f ¼ 0 ; L c ) of the links , all of which we assume have the same contour length L c . In this model , no new lengths are introduced by the averaging process , and the curve of shear modulus versus strain exhibits a universal scaling similar to that of the force – extension curve onto which data described by it will collapse . Figure 3 plots experimentally measured shear moduli G scaled by their value G 0 at zero strain versus strain g normalized by the strain g 4 at which G ¼ 4 G ( 0 ) . The value of 4 is arbitrarily chosen as the degree of stiffening that most systems examined exhibit before failure . The data collapse approximately onto the universal curve at modest strains , suggesting that the initial strain - stiffening in biopolymer networks is dominated by entropic effects that are well captured by our theory . The theory developed thus far concerns only the low strain regime where entropic elasticity dominates . Figure 3 shows that at high strains departures from the theory become apparent , presum - ably because entropy alone does not capture all the physics of these systems . We now modify the model to address these deviations , assuming that they arise from enthalpic contributions to f ( L ) , which we describe by introducing a stretch modulus K , measuring the longitudinal compliance of our previously inextensible ﬁlaments ( K ¼ 1 ) . The force – extension relation , equation ( 2 ) , for ﬁnite K becomes L K ð f ; L c Þ ¼ 1 þ f K (cid:6) (cid:7) L f 1 þ f K (cid:6) (cid:7) ; L c (cid:6) (cid:7) where L ( f ; L c ) is deﬁned by equation ( 2 ) . The persistence length and the stretch modulus of a rod are not independent : for a cylindrical tube of radius r they are related through 23 l p = K ¼ r 2 = 4 k B T . The restriction that all ﬁlaments have the same end - to - end length is also not realistic , even if they have the same contour length . Crosslinking of thermally undulating ﬁlaments creates local pair - wise node separations that differ from the zero - force end - to - end lengths of the ﬁlaments . By generalizing the classical theory of elasticity of crosslinked ﬂexible polymers , we take the distribution function of end - to - end lengths of ﬁlaments in our network to be the equilibrium distribution of end - to - end lengths of semiﬂexible inextensible ﬁlaments of contour length L c ( ref . 24 ) : P ð r Þ ¼ 2 l p L 2c X 1 n ¼ 1 ð p n Þ 2 ð 2 1 Þ n þ 1 exp 2 l p ð p n Þ 2 L c 1 2 r L c (cid:6) (cid:7) (cid:8) (cid:9) An important consequence of having distributed lengths in this manner is that the network’s ﬁlaments no longer individually experience zero force ( as they do for a distribution with all lengths equal to the mean ) : some are stretched while others are compressed relative to their relaxed length . As a consequence , bulk mechanical equilibrium at zero isotropic stress will occur not at zero strain but at an isotropic strain described by a deformation tensor L 0 ; ij ¼ L 0 d ij . The deformation L 0 is determined by the condition that the isotropic part of the stress tensor j I d ij vanishes . The angular average in the expression for the stress tensor in the presence of isotropic deformations is calculated to yield j I ð L 0 Þ ¼ r 3 L 20 ð L c 0 d r r P ð r Þ f ð L 0 L ð f ¼ 0 ; L c ÞÞ ¼ 0 as the condition determining L 0 . This equation is solved numeri - cally for particular parameter values . L 0 is not an extra parameter — it is determined by the force – extension relation and the distribution function , both of which are functions of the persistence length , the Figure 3 Scaled modulus – strain curves for various biopolymer networks compared to theory and the scaled force – extension relation for a semiﬂexible polymer .

The extended theory makes speciﬁc predictions about how strain - stiffening scales with network density , and we test this by ﬁtting to a series of modulus - strain curves for ﬁbrin at different mass concentrations . Figure 4 shows the experimental data and the theoretical curves . The persistence length was experimentally deter - mined to be 0 . 5 m m by computing the length scale for the decay of tangent – tangent correlations based on digitized microscopic images of ﬁbrin ﬁlaments such as those in Fig . 1 . The mesh size y of an isotropic network of polymers is calculated from the mass per unit length of polymer , l , and the mass density , c . The number of links per unit volume is r ¼ l / cL c ¼ 3 / ( y 2 L c ) . We assume that y < L c so that r ¼ 3 / y 3 . As r , y and L 0 are all determined by the mass concentration , our model has only one free parameter , the stretch modulus K . The best - ﬁt values for K from Fig . 4 are of the order of 50 – 100 pN , very close to the elastic - rod estimate of K ¼ 4 k B Tl p / r 2 for a rod of radius r ¼ 10 nm and l p ¼ 0 . 5 m m . For all parameter values considered , L 0 is smaller than , but of the order of , one , implying a small isotropic compression due to the asymmetric character of the single ﬁlament force – extension relation ( see the inset to Fig . 3 ) . As force rises steeply for extensions but remains relatively ﬂat for compressions , stretched ﬁlaments con - tribute more to the residual stress after crosslinking , and the net - work as a whole will shrink . Nonlinear elasticity , and speciﬁcally strain - stiffening , is generic to any network composed of semiﬂexible ﬁlamentous proteins . The degree of strain - stiffening can exceed tenfold increases in shear moduli under strains as small as 20 % . The strain at which stiffening becomes signiﬁcant depends strongly on the persistence length of the ﬁlament . Stiffer ﬁlaments , like F - actin or collagen , stiffen at a few per cent strain whereas more ﬂexible ﬁlaments like vimentin stiffen only at larger strains , approaching 100 % . The functional form of strain - stiffening at intermediate strain is generic for all semiﬂexible systems , but the maximal degree of strain - stiffening depends on such molecular details as the compliance of ﬁlaments to extension . Likewise , the strain at which the networks rupture also depends on the nature of the chemical bonds holding the ﬁlaments together . These results have implications for cytoskeletal and other bio - polymer networks . They suggest that the design of artiﬁcial bioma - terials to replace tissues such as the arterial wall , whose function requires nonlinear elastic response 1 , could be facilitated by using polymers of stiffness and mesh size appropriate to produce strain - stiffening at the required range of deformations . Using this non - linear passive elasticity , biological systems like the cytoskeleton can actively manipulate their stiffness by local contraction of the network using motor proteins . The inherent strain - stiffening of semiﬂexible polymer networks is only a starting point for the designs that have evolved to endow biological materials with their mechanical properties . Many strain - stiffening tissues have strikingly ordered stiff ﬁlaments co - assembled with an amorphous matrix . Variation of ordered elements in harder material like bone or wood provides other mechanisms to create nonlinear elasticity . The signiﬁcance of the present work is that it shows such geometrical ordering is not required to produce the high degree of strain - stiffening that is an essential aspect of the elasticity of isotropic networks of crosslinked semiﬂexible polymers .
