The prevailing paradigm for WASP regulation invokes allosteric relief of autoinhibition by diverse upstream activators . Here we demon - strate an additional level of regulation that is super - imposed upon allostery : dimerization increases the afﬁnity of active WASP species for Arp2 / 3 complex by up to 180 - fold , greatly enhancing actin assembly by this system . This ﬁnding explains a large and apparently disparate set of observations under a common mechanistic framework . These include WASP activation by the bacterial effector EspFu and a large number of SH3 domain proteins , the effects on WASP of membrane localization / clustering and assembly into large complexes , and cooperativity between different family members . Allostery and dimerization act in hierarchical fashion , enabling WASP / WAVE proteins to integrate different classes of inputs to produce a wide range of cellular actin responses . INTRODUCTION Dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton are an integral part of many cellular processes including migration , adhesion , establishment and maintenance of polarity , and vesicle trafﬁcking ( Chhabra and Higgs , 2007 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . Defects in cytoskeletal structure and dynamics contribute to a variety of diseases , including cancer , developmental disorders , immunodeﬁciencies , and bacterial / viral infection ( Munter et al . , 2006 ; Ochs and Thrasher , 2006 ; Yamazaki et al . , 2005 ) . Actin dynamics are regu - lated both spatially and temporally by a wide array of extracellular signals . Members of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family play central roles in processing these signals to control actin architecture and rearrangements ( Chhabra and Higgs , 2007 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Stradal and Scita , 2006 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . WASP proteins exert their function by controlling the ubiquitous actin nucleation factor , Arp2 / 3 complex . The family includes WASP , the widely ex - pressed neuronal - WASP ( N - WASP ) , and several Scar / WAVE proteins ( Campellone et al . , 2008 ; Linardopoulou et al . , 2007 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . WASP proteins are themselves regulated by numerous diverse signals , including Rho family GTPases , phospholipids , kinases , many SH3 domain - containing proteins , and both bacterial and viral pathogen proteins ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . Integration of these signals results in the precise spatial and temporal control over actin dynamics that is necessary for cell organization and function . The prevailing model for WASP regulation invokes inhibitory intramolecular contacts between the regulatory GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) and the activity - bearing VCA domain of the pro - tein ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ; Leung and Rosen , 2005 ; Papayan - nopoulos et al . , 2005 ; Pollard , 2007 ; Stradal and Scita , 2006 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . These autoinhibitory interac - tions block VCA stimulation of Arp2 / 3 complex . WASP activators relieve autoinhibition allosterically by disrupting the GBD - VCA contacts , enabling the VCA to activate Arp2 / 3 complex . An analogous mechanism involving intermolecular inhibition of the VCA has also been proposed for regulation of WAVE proteins ( Eden et al . , 2002 ) . The allosteric model originally derived from studies of N - WASP activation by Cdc42 , a Rho family GTPase ( Kim et al . , 2000 ; Miki et al . , 1998 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . Structural and biophysical studies have shown that it can explain the regulation of WASP and N - WASP by many ligands , including Cdc42 , PIP 2 ( but see below ) , kinases / phosphatases , SH2 domain - containing proteins , and bacterial pathogen proteins ( Kim et al . , 2000 ; Prehoda et al . , 2000 ; Cheng et al . , 2008 ; Leung and Rosen , 2005 ; Peterson et al . , 2004 ; Torres and Rosen , 2003 ) . However , many reported observations on WASP proteins are not readily explained by allostery alone . First , although a single repeated element in the pathogen protein EspFu / TccP can mod - estly activate WASP by displacing the GBD from the VCA , multi - repeat fragments result in much stronger stimulation of Arp2 / 3 complex ( see below and Garmendia et al . , 2006 ; Sallee et al . , 2008 ) . Second , the ability of WASP proteins to stimulate Arp2 / 3 complex can be increased by numerous SH3 - containing ligands , which bind the large ( (cid:2) 125 residues ) , structurally disordered proline - rich domain that connects the GBD to the VCA ( Taken - awa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . It is difﬁcult ( albeit not impossible ) to 426 Molecular Cell 32 , 426 – 438 , November 7 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . envision how SH3 binding to this long , ﬂexible loop could desta - bilize the GBD - VCA domain to which it is attached . Third , while the isolated WASP VCA can activate Arp2 / 3 complex , the fusion of the VCA to dimeric glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) is a much stronger activator ( Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ) . Fourth , direct and indirect clustering of WASP proteins at membranes in vitro and in vivo can increase Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly , indepen - dent of obvious allosteric rearrangements ( Castellano et al . , 1999 ; Papayannopoulos et al . , 2005 ; Rivera et al . , 2004 ; Yarar et al . , 2007 ) . Finally , WASP and N - WASP are often reported to function within large assemblies that are organized around mul - tivalent adaptor proteins ( Ho et al . , 2004 ; Tehrani et al . , 2007 ; Yarar et al . , 2007 ) . In vitro , incorporation of N - WASP into these assemblies can increase activity toward Arp2 / 3 complex independent of obvious allosteric drivers ( Tehrani et al . , 2007 ) or sensitize the system toward allosteric activation ( Ho et al . , 2004 ) . These various observations suggest that an important mechanism or mechanisms of regulating the activity of WASP proteins toward Arp2 / 3 complex , in addition to allostery , remain to be discovered . Here we show that dimerization of active WASP species provides an additional layer of regulation beyond allostery . VCA dimers bind Arp2 / 3 complex in 1 : 1 fashion ( two VCAs per Arp2 / 3 ) with 100 - to 180 - fold higher afﬁnity than VCA monomers . This ﬁnding leads to a hierarchical model for WASP / WAVE regulation in which an inner layer of allostery controls VCA access and an outer layer of dimerization ( or more generally oligomerization ) signiﬁcantly enhances potency toward Arp2 / 3 complex . This model provides a common mechanistic framework that explains the wide range of apparently disparate data on WASP regulation listed above . Probabilistic arguments illustrate how oligomeriza - tion can enhance the dimerization effect to control WASP activity and potentiate the effects of allosteric inputs , explaining the prevalence of large assemblies throughout WASP biology . RESULTS Dimerization Increases VCA Afﬁnity for Arp2 / 3 Complex by More Than 100 - Fold Higgs and Pollard reported that in pyrene - actin assembly assays a GST fusion of the WASP VCA has a much greater activity to - ward Arp2 / 3 complex than the isolated VCA ( Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ) . GST forms very high - afﬁnity dimers in solution ( K D < 1 nM , data not shown ) , and these authors suggested that dimeric VCA might have higher activity than monomer . As shown in Figure 1A , this effect is also observed for the N - WASP and WAVE1 VCAs , whose GST fusions have much greater activity than monomers . This effect is due to dimerization rather than attachment to GST , since puriﬁed GST : GST - VCA heterodimers have much lower activity than homodimer ( see Figure S1 available online ) . Further , chemically crosslinked WASP VCA ( xlWASP VCA ) and the rapa - mycin - mediated heterodimer of FKBP - VCA and mTOR - VCA ( Banaszynski et al . , 2005 ) show activity comparable to GST - VCA ( Figure 1B ) . Most assays of Arp2 / 3 activation reported in the lit - erature have been performed in 50 mM KCl buffer . Under these conditions , 10 – 100 nM concentrations of WASP family VCAs produce signiﬁcant activation of Arp2 / 3 complex . However , at physiologic salt ( 150 mM KCl ) , the activity of N - WASP VCA is substantially reduced and WASP and WAVE1 VCAs are virtually inactive , while GST - VCAs retain substantial activity ( Figures 1B and 1C and data not shown ) . Thus , dimerization of the VCA element appears to be a general mechanism of increasing activ - ity of WASP family proteins toward Arp2 / 3 complex that is likely important under physiologic conditions . We next asked how dimerization increases VCA activity . One possibility was that ﬁlament barbed end binding by one V region ( Co et al . , 2007 ) increased the local F - actin concentration relative to the second VCA and its bound Arp2 / 3 complex . However , a GST - VCA mutant impaired in barbed end binding has activity comparable to wild - type ( Figure S2 ) , arguing against this model . Instead we asked whether the nature of the Arp2 / 3 - VCA interac - tion is changed when VCA is dimeric . Current models of active Arp2 / 3 invoke only a single VCA - binding site in the complex ( Chhabra and Higgs , 2007 ; Goley and Welch , 2006 ; Pollard , 2007 ; Stradal and Scita , 2006 ) . We determined the stoichiometry of the complex between GST - WASP VCA dimers and Arp2 / 3 using two different methods . In sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation experiments ( Figure 2A and Figure S3 ) , GST - WASP VCA and Arp2 / 3 had their expected masses of 73 . 7 kDa ( calculated dimer mass , 70 . 2 kDa ) and 208 kDa ( calculated mass , 224 kDa ) when analyzed separately . For mixtures with GST - VCA : Arp2 / 3 ratios greater than 2 : 1 ( in monomer units ) , we observed two species , consistent with the GST - WASP VCA dimer ( experimental mass , 73 . 9 kDa ) and a 2 : 1 complex of GST - WASP VCA and Arp2 / 3 ( experimental mass , 286 kDa ; calculated mass , 294 kDa ) . The experimentally derived masses correspond well to the calculated masses , and the data clearly do not support the presence of a 2 : 2 complex of GST - WASP VCA and Arp2 / 3 ( calculated mass , 518 kDa ) . Analyzing the data , explicitly accounting for complex association also yielded a high - afﬁnity 2 : 1 complex ( see the Supplemental Data ) . When experiments were performed at a GST - VCA : Arp2 / 3 ratio of 1 . 4 : 1 , the smaller species was not observed and the sedimentation coefﬁcient of the larger species decreased , suggesting a mixture of free Arp2 / 3 and the 2 : 1 complex . We also measured the mass of the complex using multiangle static light scattering , which yielded a value of 302 kDa ( Figure 2B ) , again indicating 2 : 1 stoi - chiometry . Thus , by two independent analytical methods we ﬁnd that a VCA dimer binds a single Arp2 / 3 complex . We used a ﬂuorescence competition binding assay to mea - sure the afﬁnities of VCA monomers and GST - VCA dimers for Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 2C and Figure S4 ) ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) . The afﬁnities for monomer VCAs are similar to those reported previously , ranging from 1 . 6 to 4 . 4 m M ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ; Zalevsky et al . , 2001 ) . Thedimers allhadsubstantially higher afﬁnity , between 9 and 29 nM , when data were ﬁt to a model with 2 : 1 stoichiometry of GST - VCA to Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 2C and Figure S4 ) . This corresponds to an increase in afﬁnity of 100 - , 150 - , and 180 - fold for WASP , WAVE1 , and N - WASP , respectively . Increased afﬁnity is also manifest in vivo . Small amounts of Arp2 / 3 can be precipitated with Ni 2 + - afﬁnity resin from HEK293 cells coexpressing His 6 - tagged FKBP - VCA and Flag - tagged mTOR - VCA , but dimerization of the VCAs with rapamycin increasestheprecipitatedArp2 / 3bymorethan 3 - fold ( Figure2D ) . This effect requires two VCAs in the rapamycin - mediated Molecular Cell Hierarchical Regulation of WASP / WAVE Proteins Molecular Cell 32 , 426 – 438 , November 7 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . 427 complex , as His - tagged FKBP precipitates mTOR - VCA but very little Arp2 / 3 under similar conditions . To test whether increased afﬁnity is sufﬁcient to account for the increased actin assembly activity of the dimers , we mea - sured the activities of N - WASP VCA and GST - N - WASP VCA at a range of concentrations ( Figure S5 ) . At saturation , the kinetics of actin assembly and concentration of ﬁlament barbed ends produced by monomer and dimer are essentially identical , similar to observations with the WASP VCA ( Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ) . This suggests that differences at lower concentrations are principally due to the differences in VCA afﬁnity for Arp2 / 3 complex ( which will not have an effect at saturation ) . As de - scribed in the Supplemental Data ( see also Figure S6 ) , kinetic simulations of actin assembly using a previously reported model ( Zalevsky et al . , 2001 ) lead to the same conclusion . These combined data show that dimerization represents a general mechanism of increasing the activity of WASP family VCAs by greatly enhancing their afﬁnity for Arp2 / 3 in a 2 : 1 complex . How does dimerization increase afﬁnity of the VCA for Arp2 / 3 complex ? Dimerization does not induce structural changes in the Figure 1 .

Without rapamycin , 100 nM mTOR - WASP VCA + 100 nM FKBP - WASP VCA has activity comparable to 200 nM WASP VCA ( data not shown ) .

An alterna - tive mechanism stems from behavior of the cortactin protein , which can bind Arp2 / 3 complex simultaneously with VCA pep - tides , utilizing an element analogous to the A region of the VCA ( termed NtA ) ( Figure S8 and Weaver et al . [ 2002 ] ) . Thus , Arp2 / 3 complex appears to have two binding sites for A region peptides , one favored by VCA and one favored by cortactin , that can be engaged simultaneously . In the context of a VCA dimer , the cortactin site could be engaged by the second VCA , increasing afﬁnity . To test this possibility , we examined the interactions of rhodamine - NtA ( rNtA ) with Arp2 / 3 complex in the presence of competitors ( Figure 2E ) . Unlabeled NtA potently displaces rNtA from Arp2 / 3 complex ( K D = 17 nM ) , but monomeric VCA is much less effective ( Figure 2E ) . Thus , the cortactin site on Arp2 / 3 Figure 2 .

( F ) Cartoon model of ( VCA ) 2 binding to two distinct sites on Arp2 / 3 complex . The cartoon does not show the exact location of the sites on Arp2 / 3 but merely the presence of two binding sites , both of which are engaged by di - VCA materials . Molecular Cell Hierarchical Regulation of WASP / WAVE Proteins Molecular Cell 32 , 426 – 438 , November 7 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . 429 complex binds NtA tightly but VCA only modestly . In contrast , di - meric xlWASP VCA displaces rNtA very effectively ( K D = 70 nM , similar to that derived from displacement of ﬂuorescent VCA ; Figure 2C ) . The simplest explanation for these data is that xlWASP VCA simultaneously engages both the canonical VCA and cortactin binding sites on Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 2F ) . Thus , dimerization of WASP increases afﬁnity for Arp2 / 3 complex by enabling multivalent binding . If the effect of dimerization applies to full - length WASP pro - teins , then ligands capable of assembling multiple active WASPs on a single scaffold should act as potent enhancers of activity . We note that thermodynamics dictates that since dimerization increases the afﬁnity of WASPs for Arp2 / 3 complex , Arp2 / 3 com - plex must identically increase the afﬁnity of WASPs for dimerizer molecules . Thus , such dimerizer - WASP - Arp2 / 3 assemblies should form in a highly cooperative fashion . To better understand the behavior of such systems , we modeled the activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by WASP in the presence of a bivalent ligand . This modeling predicted several characteristic features in a titra - tion of a dimerizing ligand into WASP ( Figure 3 and Figure S9 ) . First , for low WASP concentrations , a dimerizer can produce ac - tivity substantially above that of the corresponding VCA , due to the higher afﬁnity of the ( WASP ) 2 species for Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 3A ) . We refer to this phenomenon as ‘‘hyperactivation’’ throughout the text . Second , titration of a dimerizer into WASP will give a bell - shaped activity proﬁle , distinct from the mono - tonic increase in activity induced by a monomeric activator ( Fig - ure 3A ) . At low dimerizer concentration , little WASP is bound and activity is low ( Figure 3D , 1 ) . For intermediate concentrations , some dimerizer molecules engage two WASP molecules , and this high - afﬁnity ( WASP ) 2 species will have activity beyond that of the VCA ( Figure 3D , 2 ) . At high dimerizer concentration , most WASP is bound , but the probability of two WASP molecules engaging the same dimerizer molecule is low ( Figure 3D , 3 ) . Therefore , activity will be comparable to that of the monovalent activator or of the free VCA . Together , these effects produce a bell - shaped activity proﬁle . Analogous behavior is also ob - served in titrations involving a constitutively active WASP mutant Figure 3 . Modeling Predicts Unusual Behavior in Dimerizer Titrations The concentration of active Arp2 / 3 complex was modeled as a function of dimerizing WASP ligands with different properties . Here , ligand binding is concomitant with allosteric relief of autoinhibition . See Figure S9 for ligands binding to constitutively active WASP ligands .

Finally , a monovalent version of the dimerizer will compete for WASP binding , actively blocking dimerizer - induced hyperactivation ( Figures 3B and 3D , 4 , and Figure S9B ) . With these predictions in hand , we asked if dimerization might account for some of the unexplained WASP / N - WASP activation phenomena described in the Introduction . Dimerization Generates Interrepeat Cooperativity in WASP / N - WASP Activation by EspFu Enterohemorrhagic E . coli ( EHEC ) is an important food - borne hu - man pathogen that subverts the actin cytoskeleton of host cells during infection ( Campellone et al . , 2004 ; Garmendia et al . , 2004 , 2006 ) . EHEC induces ﬁlamentous actin ‘‘pedestals’’ at sites of bacterial attachment by injecting the proteins Tir and EspFu into the eukaryotic cytoplasm . Tir inserts into the plasma mem - brane beneath the bound bacterium and recruits EspFu , which in turn binds and activates N - WASP . EspFu is composed of an N - terminal translocation sequence followed by 2 to 7 . 5 repeats of 47 residues ( Campellone et al . , 2004 ; Garmendia et al . , 2004 , 2005 ) . We recently showed that a single repeat of EspFu ( 1R ) alloste - rically activates WASP / N - WASP by binding the GBD and releas - ing the VCA ( Cheng et al . , 2008 ) . However , two repeats ( 2R ) have signiﬁcantly greater activity ( Garmendia et al . , 2006 ; Sallee et al . , 2008 ) , even when normalized for total repeat concentration ( Figure 5A ) . Thus , repeats cooperatively promote actin assem - bly . Cooperativity does not involve interrepeat effects on the af - ﬁnity of EspFu for N - WASP , since isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) measurements show that 1R ( the fourth repeat ) and 2R C ( identical repeats four and ﬁve ) bind with indistinguishable afﬁn - ity but 2 - fold different stoichiometry ( K D = 35 ± 5 nM and 39 ± 2 nM , respectively [ Cheng et al . , 2008 ] , and data not shown ) to an autoinhibited C - terminal fragment of N - WASP ( N - WASP C , Figure S10 ) . We asked whether cooperativity arises from assem - bly of two active WASP proteins on 2R , producing a dimer with high afﬁnity for Arp2 / 3 complex . Titration of 1R into N - WASP C produces a monotonic increase in activity ( deﬁned in the Exper - imental Procedures ) approaching that of free VCA , as expected for a ligand that relieves autoinhibition ( Figure 4A ) . In contrast , titration with 2R produces a bell - shaped activity proﬁle with a peak well above that of free VCA ( Figure 4A ) . For 25 nM N - WASP C , activity increases rapidly as 2R is added , peaks at 50 nM 2R , then decreases as 2R is increased further and pla - teaus near 1 m M . The decrease in activity at high concentration is not due to nonspeciﬁc inhibition , as 500 nM 2R has no effect on VCA - mediated actin assembly ( data not shown ) . Moreover , the 1R and 2R titrations plateau at an activity near that of free VCA , suggesting that high concentrations of either fragment produce monomeric , allosterically activated N - WASP C . Similar behavior is observed using 2R C , which has a 3 - fold tighter afﬁnity for N - WASP C , and also for a titration performed at physiologic salt concentration ( Figure S11 ) . Hyperactivation of N - WASP C by 2R can be blocked by addi - tion of 1R , which competes with 2R for N - WASP C with compara - ble afﬁnity ( Figure 4B ) . As in the 2R titration , the ﬁnal activity in this 1R back titration is near that of free VCA . These data show that 1R is not merely a weaker activator than 2R ( cf . Figure 4A ) but rather can actively block hyperactivation by 2R . Together , these data support a model in which interrepeat cooperativity in EspFu results from dimerization of active N - WASP , yielding a higher potency activator of Arp2 / 3 complex . We next asked whether interrepeat cooperativity is important in pedestal assembly in mammalian cells . We used an N - terminal fragment of Tir , fused to fragments of EspFu , to bypass mem - brane recruitment of EspFu by Tir and allow direct analysis of ac - tin assembly activity in cells ( previously described in Cheng et al . , 2008 ) . A single repeat of EspFu consists of a 33 residue N - WASP binding element ( W ) and a 14 residue proline - rich segment ( P ) ( Cheng et al . , 2008 ) . We expressed Tir fusions containing no EspFu fragment ( Tir D C ) , WP ( = 1R ) , or WPW . Treatment of cells expressing WPW with intimin - expressing E . coli produced numerous clusters of Tir and F - actin coincident with bound bac - teria ( Figure 1D ) . In contrast , treatment of cells expressing WP generated clusters of Tir without associated F - actin , similar to Tir D C , indicating that the weaker activation of N - WASP by a single EspFu repeat observed in vitro is incapable of promoting detectable actin assembly in this cell - based assay . Thus , coop - erativity between EspFu - bound N - WASP proteins appears to be important in assembling actin in cells . A ﬁve repeat EspFu fragment ( 5R ) has a somewhat higher activity than 2R ( Figure 5A ) , such that the relative activities are 1R < < 2R C < 5R . Simple statistics can explain this effect ( see the Supplemental Data ) . If one compares different n - repeat con - structs at a ﬁxed total repeat concentration and low occupancy of repeats by N - WASP ( e . g . , [ N - WASP ] < K D , N - WASP ) , the relative concentration of ( WASP ) 2 complexes scales as ( n - 1 ) . Therefore , more repeats will give higher activity , potentially explaining the fact that , in most sequenced EHEC serotypes , EspFu has three or more repeats ( Garmendia et al . , 2005 ) . An analogous argu - ment suggests that higher - order oligomerization should gener - ally enhance the activity of WASP proteins by increasing the probability that two active species will be proximal ( see the Discussion ) . Our combined data on EspFu indicate that EHEC has evolved two mechanistically distinct but coupled activities to drive actin assembly : allosteric release of the N - WASP VCA and oligomerization of active N - WASP to increase potency toward Arp2 / 3 complex . Dimerization Contributes to Enhancement of WASP / N - WASP Activity by SH3 Domain Proteins More than 30 SH3 proteins have been reported to bind WASP , N - WASP , and / or the WAVEs ( see Takenawa and Suetsugu [ 2007 ] for a fairly complete list ) . These interactions occur through the 100 – 200 residue proline - rich region found in all family mem - bers . Many SH3 - containing ligands have been demonstrated to enhance the activity of WASP and / or N - WASP toward Arp2 / 3 complex in actin assembly assays in vitro , including Nck ( Rohatgi et al . , 2001 ) , Abi1 ( Innocenti et al . , 2005 ) , Grb2 , Fyn , PI 3 - kinase p85 , PLC g , WISH ( Fukuoka et al . , 2001 ) , FBP17 ( Tsu - jita et al . , 2006 ) , SNX9 ( Yarar et al . , 2007 ) , and PACSIN / syndapin ( see below ) . In virtually all cases , enhancement was achieved with ligands containing multiple SH3 domains . This multiplicity resulted from self - association of the ligands , multiple SH3 domains in the monomeric ligand , or the use of GST - SH3 fusions . Approximately 10 % of WASP is active in solution , even in the absence of allosteric activators ( Fukuoka et al . , Molecular Cell Hierarchical Regulation of WASP / WAVE Proteins Molecular Cell 32 , 426 – 438 , November 7 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . 431 Figure 4 .

Thus , oligomerization of WASP proteins through interactions with mul - tivalent SH3 - containing ligands might create dimers of active WASP . To separate relief of autoinhibition from dimerization / oligomer - ization , we generated a mutant of N - WASP C ( N - WASP C * , L232P in the GBD , Figure S10 ) , where autoinhibitory regulation is dis - rupted ( Devriendt et al . , 2001 ) . N - WASP C * has a nearly identical activity toward Arp2 / 3 complex as VCA alone ( data not shown ) and is not further activated by excess Cdc42 - GMPPNP ( data not shown ) . We then asked whether various SH3 proteins affect N - WASP C * stimulation of Arp2 / 3 complex . The ﬁrst was an SH3 - containing fragment of Nck ( Nck F ) . While Nck F has no effect on actin assembly through N - WASP C * , the GST - Nck F fusion in - creases activity substantially , hyperactivating the constitutively active mutant ( Figure 6A ) . GST - Nck F has no effect on activity of the isolated VCA . Hyperactivation of N - WASP C * requires Nck F dimerization , since GST : GST - Nck F heterodimers are largely inactive ( Figure S12 ) . Importantly , Nck F monomer can partially block enhancement by the GST - Nck fusion , strongly suggesting that monomer can bind N - WASP C * . Thus , binding without oligo - merization is insufﬁcient to produce hyperactivation . We next examined PACSIN2 , an N - WASP ligand from the PCH family , many of whose members bind and / or activate WASP proteins ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . PCH proteins contain an N - terminal F - BAR domain , which forms a constitutive homo - dimer , and a C - terminal SH3 domain ( Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . As with GST - Nck F , PACSIN2 hyperactivates N - WASP C * ( Figure 4C ) . A GST fusion of the PACSIN2 SH3 domain hyperactivates similarly , suggesting that this effect stems from the dimeric SH3 domain rather than particular properties of the PACSIN2 Figure 6 .

Analogous to the 2R fragment of EspFu , titration of PACSIN2 produces a bell - shaped activity pro - ﬁle ( Figure 4C ) . The degree of activation is not as high as with 2R , likely due to a lower afﬁnity for N - WASP ( see the Discussion ) . Again , hyperactivationisblockedbyexcessSH3monomeratcon - centrations that have no effect on N - WASP C * alone ( Figure 4D ) . These data show that even when autoinhibitory contacts are eliminated , dimeric SH3 domains can further increase the ability of N - WASP to stimulate Arp2 / 3 complex . This ﬁnding is consis - tent with a model in which dimeric / oligomeric WASP proteins assembled by SH3 dimers more potently activate the Arp2 / 3 complex than monomers . Thus , dimerization / oligomerization may be a signiﬁcant component of SH3 - mediated activation of WASP proteins . The Dimerization Effect Contributes to N - WASP Activation by PIP 2 The lipid PIP 2 ( phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ) , a known activator of WASP proteins ( Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ; Prehoda et al . , 2000 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) , binds to a basic peptide seg - ment ( B ) N - terminal to the GBD ( Prehoda et al . , 2000 ) . Prevailing mechanisms of N - WASP activation by PIP 2 focus on relief of inhibition ( Papayannopoulos et al . , 2005 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2001 ) . Indeed , PIP 2 can displace B - GBD from VCA ( Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ) , demonstrating that relief of autoinhibition is a component of PIP 2 - mediated activation of WASP proteins . Intriguingly , N - WASP proteins recruited to moving PIP 2 - rich vesicles have a high local density , such that their spacing ( < 5 nm [ Co et al . , 2007 ] ) is less than the spacing predicted between the SH3 do - mains in the PACSIN2 dimer ( (cid:2) 16 nm assuming a disordered F - BAR - SH3 linker ) ( Miller et al . , 1967 ) . This implies that high - density WASP molecules on PIP 2 vesicles may act as dimers and more potently activate Arp2 / 3 complex . A similar argument has recently been made for the Arp2 / 3 activator from Listeria monocytogenes , ActA , which is expressed at high density on the bacterial surface ( Footer et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , we asked whether the dimerization effect could contribute to PIP 2 - mediated activation . To separate relief of autoinhibition from the clustering of N - WASP on the surface of vesicles , we created a construct that fused the basic region to N - WASP C and deleted much of the GBD , creating a construct capable of binding PIP 2 but lack - ing allosteric regulation ( N - WASP BC * , Figure S10 ) . N - WASP BC * has a somewhat lower activity than free VCA ( Figure 4E ) , possi - bly due to inhibitory interactions of the basic region with Arp2 / 3 ( Suetsugu et al . , 2001 ) or the acidic region . However , addition of high - density PIP 2 vesicles ( 20 % mole fraction ) hyperactivates N - WASP BC * ( Figure 4E ) . Activation is dose dependent , with 2 m M PIP 2 producing substantially more activity than VCA alone . This concentration of PIP 2 does not affect activity of the free VCA ( data not shown ) . If hyperactivation is the result of bringing multiple VCA domains into close proximity , then the effect should be sensitive to PIP 2 density on vesicles . To test this possibility , we used vesicles with different PIP 2 densities to activate N - WASP BC * . These vesicles were used at concentrations of 2 m M PIP 2 in solution but at differing carrier lipid concentrations ( see scheme 1 in Figure 4F ) . Here , hyperactivation decreases with decreasing PIP 2 density , such that 8 % PIP 2 vesicles do not hyperactivate N - WASP BC * ( Figure 4F ) . To test if the loss of hyperactivation is simply due to increased carrier lipid , we mixed preformed 20 % PIP 2 vesicles and carrier vesicles . Since the vesicles do not fuse , the density of PIP 2 on individual vesicles does not change from the parent preparations , but total lipid concentrations can be matched to the density titration above ( see scheme 2 in Fig - ure 4F ) . In this experiment , hyperactivation is largely maintained , suggesting that the effect requires high PIP 2 density . A previous study showed that , at higher salt conditions , binding of N - WASP to vesicles was dependent on PIP 2 density ( Papayan - nopoulos et al . , 2005 ) . To distinguish activation due to vesicle binding from activation due to close proximity of VCAs on the ves - icle surface , we measured N - WASP binding to vesicles as a func - tion of PIP 2 density under conditions of the actin assembly assays ( see the Supplemental Data ) . We quantiﬁed the amount of N - WASP B ( Figure S10 ) that cosedimented with sucrose - loaded PIP 2 vesicles . As shown in Figure 4G andFigure S13 , binding does not decrease at reduced PIP 2 density and may even increase . Thus , PIP 2 vesicle binding and activation are not corre - lated in our system . Instead , the data are consistent with high potency activation of Arp2 / 3 by closely spaced VCAs on vesicles , aneffectthatislostwhenVCAsarespreadoutoveragreaterarea . Thiseffectofclusteringcould contributetothe activationofWASP proteins by PIP 2 and membrane localization in general . Cooperativity between N - WASP and WAVE1 through Heterodimerization WASP and WAVE proteins often have distinct localization and actin regulatory functions in vivo . However , during some processes , the two subfamilies colocalize and appear to control actin assembly cooperatively ( Bierne et al . , 2005 ; Unsworth et al . , 2004 ) . The WAVEs function within an assembly also con - taining Sra1 , Nap1 , Abi , and HSPC300 ( Eden et al . , 2002 ) . The isolated Abi protein can also bind and activate N - WASP through its SH3 domain ( Innocenti et al . , 2005 ) . We found that a trimeric subassembly containing Abi , HSPC300 , and WAVE1 has appreciable activity toward Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 6B ) . We asked whether this trimer , as a model for the activated WAVE complex pentamer , could produce a high - potency heterodimeric VCA through binding active N - WASP ( N - WASP BC * ) . Individually , trimer and N - WASP BC * have only weak activity , but a mixture of the two is highly active ( Figure 6B ) . This hyperactivation requires binding of trimer to N - WASP BC * , since it is not observed for mixtures of trimer with N - WASP VCA or WAVE1 VCA with N - WASP BC * ( Figure 6B ) . Hyperactivation also requires the presence of two VCAs in the complex , since itisnotobserved inamixture oftrimer withatrun - cated N - WASP lacking the VCA ( Figure S14 ) . Thus , formation of WAVE1 : N - WASP heterodimers can produce high - potency activation . This effect may allow cooperativity between N - WASP and WAVE . DISCUSSION Hierarchical Regulation of WASP / WAVE Proteins We have shown here that dimerization of WASP protein VCA el - ements increases afﬁnity for Arp2 / 3 complex by 100 - to 200 - fold Molecular Cell Hierarchical Regulation of WASP / WAVE Proteins 434 Molecular Cell 32 , 426 – 438 , November 7 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . due to bivalent VCA interactions with two distinct sites on the complex ( Figure 7 ) . Dimerization greatly increases WASP activity in vitro and can control actin assembly during bacterial infection . This effect provides a common mechanistic framework that can now explain the behaviors of a range of apparently disparate multivalent WASP family ligands . Three independent agents capable of interacting with multiple WASP proteins , EspFu , SH3 dimers , and PIP 2 - containing vesicles show similar activity proﬁles , which agree with three modeling predictions ( Figures 3 and 4 ) . First , each raises the activity of N - WASP well above that of its isolated VCA , indicating that they engage mechanisms distinct from allosteric relief of autoinhibition . Independence from allostery is also supported by data on SH3 proteins and PIP 2 , where hyperactivation is observed with constitutively active N - WASP mutants . For EspFu and SH3 proteins , the ability to hyperactivate depends critically on the presence of multiple WASP - binding sites ; monovalent proteins do not hyperactivate . Similarly , hyperactivation by PIP 2 is only observed for high - density vesicles , where VCAs are likely at sufﬁcient density to be - have as oligomers . Second , in titrations with multivalent EspFu and SH3 proteins , we observed bell - shaped activation of the N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 pathway . This shape is most pronounced for EspFu , which has only a single binding site on WASP ( the GBD ) and interacts with much higher afﬁnity . Finally , hyperactivation is eliminated by agents that disrupt WASP multimers—EspFu 2R by 1R , dimeric SH3 proteins by monomeric SH3 proteins , and dilution of PIP 2 within individual vesicles . Together , these data strongly support the notion that dimerization / oligomerization of WASP family proteins is a general and widely used mechanism of controlling WASP activity toward Arp2 / 3 complex . These ﬁndings lead to a hierarchical model for regulation of WASP / WAVE proteins ( Figure 7 ) . In this model , WASP activity is controlled by two mechanistically distinct processes . An inner layer of allostery controls accessibility of the VCA . In WASP , this occurs through autoinhibitory GBD - VCA interactions . In WAVE , this occurs through intersubunit interactions in the Sra1 / Nap1 / Abi / HSPC300 / WAVE assembly ( A . M . I . and M . K . R . , unpublished data ; Eden et al . , 2002 ) . For both WASP and WAVE , exposure of the VCA ( through presently unknown mechanisms for the latter ) produces a monomeric species with micromolar afﬁnity for Arp2 / 3 complex . This allosteric layer lies under a second layer of regulation , in which dimerization greatly increases afﬁnity for Arp2 / 3 complex . Thus , when WASP protein concentrations are low , dimerization can potently enhance activity toward Arp2 / 3 complex . Dimerization can occur through assembly by multiva - lent protein ligands and / or recruitment to high density at mem - branes . The system is genuinely hierarchical , since dimerization of completely autoinhibited WASP will not enable Arp2 / 3 stimu - lation . For example , the dimeric SH3 - containing N - WASP ligand , Toca - 1 , cannot activate the strongly inhibited N - WASP : WIP complex , except when Cdc42 partially relieves autoinhibition ( Ho et al . , 2004 ) . As detailed in the Supplemental Data , the sec - ond layer of regulation provided by dimerization will increase the inherent complexity afforded by the WASP allosteric switch . Higher - Order Oligomerization as a Probabilistic Potentiator of Allosteric Activation A large variety of data have shown that increasing the local den - sity of components of Arp2 / 3 regulatory pathways can increase actin assembly in vitro and in vivo . Membrane recruitment and complex formation through repetitive interaction modules ( e . g . , SH3 domains and proline - rich motifs ) produce Arp2 / 3 - dependent assembly of actin ﬁlament networks in cells and in biochemical reconstitutions ( Alto et al . , 2007 ; Castellano et al . , 2000 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Rivera et al . , 2004 ; Tehrani et al . , 2007 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ; Yarar et al . , 2007 ) . These complexes likely contain multiple WASP proteins . For example , PCH proteins cre - ate actin - coated membrane tubules by forming close - packed arrays on lipid surfaces that recruit N - WASP ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . We suggest that dimerization can explain enhanced actin assembly in these different systems . Dimerization increases the activity of N - WASP toward Arp2 / 3 complex even when the linker between VCAs is very long . In complex with EspFu 2R and PACSIN2 , the VCAs of active N - WASP are separated by at least 8 and 16 nm ( assuming ran - dom coil between the F - BAR and SH3 domains ) , respectively ( Cantor and Schimmel , 1980 ) . On PCH domain - induced mem - brane tubules , N - WASP is recruited by SH3 domains , which have an average spacing of (cid:2) 7 nM ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , within assemblies , VCA pairs should be capable of acting cooperatively in binding to Arp2 / 3 complex . Similar arguments hold for Arp2 / 3 activators at high density on membranes , such as N - WASP on rocketing vesicles ( Co et al . , 2007 ) or ActA on the surface of Listeria ( Footer et al . , 2008 ) . In a cluster containing n independently regulated WASP proteins , each with a probability P m of being allosterically acti - vated , the probability of at least two WASPs being active simul - taneously , P d , increases with n ( Figure 5B , relationship between P d , P m , and n given by Equation S25 , see the Supplemental Data ) . Allosteric activators act on such a cluster by increasing P m , changing activity ( as measured by P d ) according to a vertical Figure 7 . A Hierarchical Model for WASP / WAVE Regulation An inner layer of allostery controls accessibility of the VCA element . An outer layer of dimerization , or more generally oligomerization , controls afﬁnity of the active VCA for Arp2 / 3 complex . Molecular Cell Hierarchical Regulation of WASP / WAVE Proteins Molecular Cell 32 , 426 – 438 , November 7 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . 435 shift in Figure 5B . However , factors that simply increase the size of an assembly , n , will also serve as activators , causing a right - ward shift in Figure 5B . This effect is conceptually analogous to the enhanced activity observed upon increasing the number of WASP - binding repeats in EspFu at a ﬁxed total repeat con - centration ( Figure 5A ) ( see the Supplemental Data ) . In the case of assemblies , oligomerizing and allosteric inputs should show strong synergy . Finally , we note that this implies that larger complexes will have more activity toward Arp2 / 3 complex and thus more locally produced actin ﬁlaments . Taunton and colleagues have shown that the V region of N - WASP can bind ﬁlament barbed ends and that this interaction is necessary for attachment of actin net - works to moving membranes ( Co et al . , 2007 ) . They suggested that this effect could enable the actin network to capture , and thus locally concentrate , diffusing WASP proteins , resulting in localized signal ampliﬁcation . The dimerization effect that we have described here could act synergistically with this mecha - nism by enhancing Arp2 / 3 recruitment by the concentrated WASP proteins . At a molecular level , the two mechanisms sug - gest that membrane - bound WASP proteins associated with a dendritic array could have segregated functions , some binding barbed ends , others activating Arp2 / 3 . Such functional segrega - tion could also occur among VCAs in dimeric / oligomeric assem - blies . Together , these activities would give localized high - afﬁnity Arp2 / 3 activation while maintaining attachment of the network to membranes . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Generation of Materials Detailed expression and puriﬁcation procedures for all materials are provided in Table S1 and the Supplemental Data . Generally , proteins were expressed in E . coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) T1 R and puriﬁed using a combination of afﬁnity and conventional chromatographies . Actin Assembly Assays Allactinassemblyassaysexceptthoseusedforkineticmodeling ( seetheSup - plemental Data ) contained 4 m M actin ( 5 % pyrene labeled ) and 10 nM Arp2 / 3 complex in either KMEI or 150KMEI buffer , as indicated in the ﬁgure legends , and were performed as described ( Leung et al . , 2006 ) . KMEI contains 50 mM KCl ( 150 mM in 150KMEI ) , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , and 10 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 0 ) . Observation of hyperactivation required the use of freshly puriﬁed Arp2 / 3 complex . Relative activities of actin polymerization assays were quan - tiﬁed as t 50 ( VCA ) / t 50 , the time at which one half of the actin has polymerized ( t 50 ) in a VCA reference sample , divided by t 50 for the sample in question . Quantiﬁcation using ﬁlament barbed ends concentration produced qualita - tively identical results . Data shown in Figures 1 , 4 , 5 , and 6 are representative of at least two repeats of experiments . EspFu - Dependent Pedestal Assays For experiments involving actin assembly by EspFu , mouse ﬁbroblast - like cells were transfected with HA - Tir - EspFu fusions , treated with intimin - expressing E . coli for 3 . 5 hr , and then ﬁxed , permeabilized , and stained for Tir and F - actin as described ( Cheng et al . , 2008 ) . Arp2 / 3 Afﬁnity Measurements VCA and NtA afﬁnities for Arp2 / 3 complex were determined using a competi - tionbindingassaybasedontheﬂuorescenceanisotropyofrhodamine - labeled N - WASP VCA ( rVCA ) or rhodamine - labeled cortactin NtA ( rNta ) ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) . Anisotropy data were ﬁt to a full solution of equilibrium competi - tion binding ( see the Supplemental Data ) . Arp2 / 3 Pull - Downs HEK293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with plasmids encoding FKBP - WASPVCA - His 6 ( 2 . 0 m g , pCMV ) orHis 6 - FKBP ( 2 . 0 m g , pCMV ) and mTOR - WASP VCA - FLAG with a C - terminal FLAG tag ( 2 . 0 m g , pCMV ) . Cells were treated with 5 m M rapamycin or DMSO carrier , harvested by scrap - ing , and lysed in 0 . 05 % Triton - X in 50 mM Tris - Cl ( pH 7 . 5 ) with 50 mM NaCl . Each sample was a pool of six identical wells . Complexes retained on Ni - NTA agarose ( QIAGEN ) were detected by western blotting against Arp3 ( Arp3 [ A - 1 ] , Santa Cruz ) , FLAG - tag ( Anti - FLAG M2 , SIGMA ) , or His 6 - tag ( His - Probe [ H - 3 ] , Santa Cruz ) , visualized by goat anti - mouse IgG ( H + L ) - HRP conjugate ( Bio - Rad ) secondary antibodies . Data shown are representative of two independent experiments . Modeling of WASP / Dimerizer / Arp2 / 3 Equilibria We modeled the concentration of active Arp2 / 3 complex according to the binding equilibria for WASP , dimerizer , monomeric dimerizer , and Arp2 / 3 described by Equations S17 – S24 , which were solved iteratively .
