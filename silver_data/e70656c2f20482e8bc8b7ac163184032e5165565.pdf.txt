One of the only factors known to promote debranching of actin networks is the yeast homolog of glia maturation factor ( GMF ) , which is structurally related to the actin ﬁlament - severing protein coﬁlin . However , the identity of the molecular mechanism underlying debranch - ing and whether this activity extends to mammalian GMF have remained open questions . Results : Using scanning mutagenesis and total internal reﬂec - tion ﬂuorescence microscopy , we show that GMF depends on two separate surfaces for debranching . One is analogous to the G - actin and F - actin binding site on coﬁlin , but we show using ﬂuorescence anisotropy and chemical crosslinking that it instead interacts with actin - related proteins in the Arp2 / 3 complex . The other is analogous to a second F - actin binding site on coﬁlin , which in GMF appears to contact the ﬁrst actin subunit in the daughter ﬁlament . We further show that GMF binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex with low nanomolar afﬁnity and promotes the open conformation . Finally , we show that this debranching activity and mechanism are conserved for mammalian GMF . Conclusions : GMF debranches ﬁlaments by a mechanism related to coﬁlin - mediated severing , but in which GMF has evolved to target molecular junctions between actin - related proteins in the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin subunits in the daughter ﬁlament of the branch . This activity and mechanism are conserved in GMF homologs from evolutionarily distant species . Introduction The rapid assembly and disassembly of branched actin ﬁla - ment networks nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex is respon - sible for driving the locomotion of a wide variety of cellular structures [ 1 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex is a seven - subunit assem - bly consisting of two actin - like proteins and ﬁve unrelated pro - teins [ 2 , 3 ] . When bound to a nucleation - promoting factor ( NPF ) of the Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASp ) super - family , it is capable of nucleating a new actin ﬁlament [ 4 – 6 ] from theside of a preexisting mother ﬁlament [ 2 ] . Tomographic reconstructions of these branches show that the Arp2 / 3 com - plex is stably associated with junctions , positioned such that the two actin - like subunits , Arp2 and Arp3 , anchor the pointed end of the daughter ﬁlament [ 7 ] . This mechanism of Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation has been known for some time ; however , much less is known about branched network pruning and disassembly . For continuous growth and force generation , branched actin networks must be turned over as rapidly as they are polymer - ized . The actin ﬁlament - severing protein coﬁlin / ADF ( actin - depolymerizing factor ) plays one critical role in this process [ 8 – 10 ] . Coﬁlin binds cooperatively to actin ﬁlament sides and changes their twist by w 5 (cid:1) [ 11 – 14 ] . Severing occurs at the boundaries between coﬁlin - bound and unbound regions [ 15 ] . Coﬁlin also has been proposed to remove Arp2 / 3 complex branch junctions [ 16 , 17 ] . However , evidence suggests that this effect occurs via coﬁlin targeting the mother ﬁlament and not the Arp2 / 3 complex itself [ 17 ] . Coﬁlin is part of a larger superfamily of proteins called actin - depolymerizing factor homology ( ADFH ) proteins , which also includes twinﬁlin , Abp1 / drebrin , coactosin , and glia matura - tion factor ( GMF ) [ 18 ] . Although these other ADFH proteins have all been implicated in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics , their biochemical activities and genetic pheno - types are not as well understood as those of coﬁlin . GMF fam - ily proteins do not interact with actin but instead bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 19 – 21 ] . In reconstitution experiments , GMF isoforms from yeast and mammals inhibit actin nucleation stimulated by the Arp2 / 3 complex and the VCA domain of WASp - family proteins [ 19 , 21 ] . Remarkably , at much lower concentrations , yeast Gmf1 / Aim7 [ 22 ] removes daughter ﬁla - ments from their mothers without inducing severing events at other locations [ 19 ] . Thus , Gmf1 may sever at branch junc - tions . These observations have left many important questions unanswered : Is GMF’s debranching mechanism related to coﬁlin’s ﬁlament - severing mechanism ? Is debranching a conserved function ? How does GMF interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex ? To address these questions , we performed scanning muta - genesis of yeast Gmf1 to deﬁne surfaces important for its in vivo and biochemical functions . This analysis revealed that Arp2 / 3 complex binding and nucleation inhibition by GMF depend speciﬁcally on a surface that is analogous to the sur - face of coﬁlin that binds both actin monomer and ﬁlament , which we term ‘‘site 1 . ’’ Debranching requires an additional GMF surface that is analogous to a surface on coﬁlin that binds speciﬁcally to F - actin , which we term ‘‘site 2’’ [ 23 ] . We extended these analyses to mouse GMF g and determined that debranching is a conserved function . Furthermore , we found that a site 2 mutation in GMF g disrupts debranching without affecting inhibition of nucleation activity , just as was observed for this mutation in yeast Gmf1 . A combination of biophysical , modeling , and biochemical methods suggests that GMF prunes daughter ﬁlaments by a coﬁlin - related severing mechanism in which GMF uses site 1 to bind to actin - related proteins ( Arps ) in the Arp2 / 3 complex and site 2 to bind the ﬁrst actin subunit in the daughter ﬁlament . 4 These authors contributed equally to this work * Correspondence : goode @ brandeis . edu Results Site - Directed Mutagenesis of Gmf1 To dissect GMF function , we generated six gmf1 alleles based on homology to cof1 alleles that have strong defects in cell growth and actin binding . Subsequently , we generated an additional 11 alleles that target clusters of charged or strongly conserved residues in GMF . Thus , in total we mutated 38 res - idues on Gmf1 within 17 different alleles ( Figure 1A ; see also Table S1 available online ) . In yeast , deletion of GMF1 exacerbates the growth defects of a cof1 - 22 mutant , lowering the restrictive temperature from 37 (cid:1) C to 34 (cid:1) C . Expressing Gmf1 under the GMF1 pro - moter ( from a low - copy plasmid ) in the cof1 - 22 gmf1 D strain accelerates growth at 34 (cid:1) C ( Figure 1 ) . By expressing our Gmf1 mutants instead of wild - type , we identiﬁed six mutants that grew signiﬁcantly slower than a strain carrying wild - type GMF1 ( Figure 1B ; Table S1 ) . The mutated residues cluster in three distinct regions of the protein ( Figure 1C ) . The ﬁrst region , targeted by gmf1 - 17 ( p = 0 . 03 ) and gmf1 - 20 ( p < 0 . 01 ) , corresponds to the same surface as site 1 of Cof1 [ 8 ] ( Figures 1D and S1 ) . The second region , targeted by gmf1 - 101 ( p < 0 . 01 ) and gmf1 - 16 ( p < 0 . 01 ) , corresponds to the same surface as site 2 ( Figures 1D and S1 ) . The third region , targeted by gmf1 - 103 , resides on a surface - exposed b strand adjacent to gmf1 - 101 and is not part of either site . Debranching Activities of Mutant Gmf1 Proteins To better understand the activities that underlie GMF1 cellular functions , we puriﬁed the mutant Gmf1 proteins that showed defects in vivo . The mutant Gmf1 - 103 could not be puriﬁed ; thus , the growth defect may arise from a folding problem . The folding stabilities of other Gmf1 mutant proteins were similar to wild - type Gmf1 , except for Gmf1 - 17 and Gmf1 - 16 . These had about 8 (cid:1) C lower and 5 (cid:1) C lower denaturation midpoint temperatures ( T m ) , respectively ( Figure S2 ) . Note that these T m values are w 20 (cid:1) C higher than the growth tem - perature , and thus the proteins are most likely stable in vivo . We compared the debranching activity of these Gmf1 pro - teins using real - time total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy analysis of actin ﬁlament dynamics nucle - ated by yeast Arp2 / 3 complex and WASp VCA [ 19 ] . In reactions lacking Gmf1 , branched ﬁlaments were rapidly nucleated , and debranching events were rare ( Figure 2A ; 1 . 0 3 10 2 4 6 0 . 5 3 10 2 4 s 2 1 ) . We then performed this analysis in the presence of 20 nM Gmf1 or a mutant variant ( Figure 2B ) . At this concentration , debranching is readily detectable and subsaturating [ 19 ] , making the assay sensitive to differences in K i . As shown previously [ 19 ] , addition of wild - type Gmf1 accelerated the debranching rate by over 50 - fold ( Figures 2B and 2C ; 5 . 5 3 10 2 3 6 0 . 5 3 10 2 3 s 2 1 ) . Both site 1 mutants of Gmf1 were found to be defective in debranching to similar extents ( Gmf1 - 17 , 1 . 6 3 10 2 3 6 0 . 2 3 10 2 3 s 2 1 ; Gmf1 - 20 , 2 . 1 3 10 2 3 6 0 . 4 3 10 2 3 s 2 1 ; Fig - ure 2C ; Table S2 ) . Gmf1 - 101 was more strongly defective in debranching ( 7 3 10 2 4 6 2 3 10 2 4 s 2 1 ) . Gmf1 - 16 ( site 2 ) was A B C D Figure 1 .

Current Biology Vol 23 No 12 1038 not signiﬁcantly defective in debranching ( 3 . 9 3 10 2 3 6 0 . 8 3 10 2 3 s 2 1 ) . In addition to the mutants above , we puriﬁed Gmf1 - 4 , which is a serine - to - glutamate substitution , as it targets a site reported to be phosphorylated in mammalian GMF [ 20 ] . We also puriﬁed Gmf1 - 105 , because it targets a patch of acidic residues proximal to Gmf1 - 103 . Gmf1 - 4 debranched as efﬁ - ciently as wild - type Gmf1 ( Figure 2C ; Table S2 ; 5 . 0 3 10 2 3 6 0 . 8 3 10 2 3 s 2 1 ) , whereas Gmf1 - 105 debranched at a modestly reduced rate ( 2 . 6 3 10 2 3 6 0 . 5 3 10 2 3 s 2 1 ) , demonstrating that it is less impaired than any of the site 1 mutants . These results show a correlation between mutant deﬁciencies in comple - menting gmf1 D in vivo and in debranching in vitro . Inhibition of Nucleation by Arp2 / 3 Complex Depends on Site 1 of Gmf1 At higher concentrations , Gmf1 also binds to Arp2 / 3 complex in solution and inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated nucleation [ 19 – 21 ] . Therefore , we tested the mutant Gmf1 proteins for inhibition of nucleation by Arp2 / 3 complex . Wild - type Gmf1 robustly inhibited Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated nucleation ( Fig - ures 3A and 3B ) , whereas mutant Gmf1 proteins exhibited var - iable defects ( Figure 3B ; Table S2 ) . Gmf1 - 20 and Gmf1 - 17 , both of which target site 1 , were defective in Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition ( note that Gmf1 - 17 and Gmf1 - 20 saturate at different degrees of inhibition ; see Discussion ) . In contrast , Gmf1 - 16 and Gmf1 - 101 , both of which target site 2 , were not signiﬁ - cantly impaired in Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition . The results show that residues in site 1 are important for inhibition of nucleation by Arp2 / 3 complex . In contrast , site 2 does not appear to be important for inhibition of nucleation by Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 3B ) , but it is critical for debranching ( Figure 2C ) . Thus , Gmf1 - 101 uncouples debranching from Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation inhibition and suggests that debranching requires additional molecular interactions ( see Discussion ) . Curiously , our two pseudo - wild - type mutants ( Gmf1 - 4 and Gmf1 - 105 ) were strongly defective in nucleation inhibition ( Table S2 ) . This suggests that nucleation inhibition is not strongly correlated with in vivo defects and therefore that debranching may be the more important activity in yeast cells . Interestingly , Gmf1 - 16 showed no defects in nucleation inhibition or debranching despite causing strong defects in vivo ( Figure 1 ) , suggesting that this surface on Gmf1 may contribute to regulation and / or localization in vivo . Indeed , the analogous Cof1 - 16 site is implicated in PIP2 binding [ 25 ] . The mechanism of nucleation by Arp2 / 3 complex involves a number of steps , including a conformational change that brings the two Arp subunits into close proximity ( known as the ‘‘closed’’ conformation ) [ 26 ] . We used negative - stain elec - tron microscopy ( EM ) to directly image Gmf1 - GFP - bound Arp2 / 3 complex . Individual Arp2 / 3 complex particles were picked and classiﬁed ( Figure 3C ) . The class sums were used to determine the fraction of Arp2 / 3 complexes in three confor - mations ( Figure 3D ) . Without Gmf1 , 57 . 0 % of Arp2 / 3 complex particles were open , 13 . 7 % intermediate , and 29 . 2 % closed . Upon addition of Gmf1 - GFP , 70 . 2 % of the particles were open , 18 . 8 % intermediate , and 11 . 0 % closed ( Figure 3D ) . This is consistent with Gmf1 shifting the conformational distri - bution of Arp2 / 3 complex away from the closed and toward the open structure ( chi - square test , p < 0 . 01 ) . Mouse GMF g Inhibits Nucleation by Arp2 / 3 Complex and Promotes Debranching Debranching activity has thus far been demonstrated only for yeast Gmf1 . We therefore performed debranching assays using bovine Arp2 / 3 complex and puriﬁed Mus musculus GMF g [ 20 , 21 ] . This analysis revealed that GMF g indeed stim - ulates debranching ( Figure 4A ) , although it was less active than yeast Gmf1 . We then introduced an alanine substitution in GMF g at three residues ( R19A K20A K22A ) , corresponding to the yeast Gmf1 - 101 ( Figure 1A ) allele that was defective specif - ically in debranching .

GMF Interactions with the Arp2 / 3 Complex 1039 GMF g - 101 strongly abrogated debranching activity ( Fig - ure 4A ) , demonstrating a mechanistic parallel between yeast and mouse GMFs . We further compared the abilities of wild - type GMF g and mutant GMF g - 101 to inhibit Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated nucle - ation . GMF g and GMF g - 101 inhibited actin assembly by bovine Arp2 / 3 complex equally well ( Figure 4B ) . Therefore , mouse GMF g - 101 exhibits properties similar to those of its yeast counterpart : it is strongly impaired in debranching but shows normal nucleation inhibition activity . Remarkably , mouse GMF g could inhibit yeast Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 4C ) , providing further evidence that the nature of the interactions between Arp2 / 3 complex and GMF is conserved across phylo - genetic kingdoms . Binding of Gmf1 to Arp2 / 3 Complex Our ﬁnding that Gmf1 site 1 is critical for the debranching and nucleation inhibition functions points to a possible interaction between Gmf1 and one or both Arp subunits in the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Arp2 and / or Arp3 ) . Indeed , in coﬁlin , site 1 binds to actin in a cleft between subdomains I and III [ 27 ] , a region high - ly conserved among actin , Arp2 , and Arp3 [ 28 ] . To determine the stoichiometry of Gmf1 - Arp2 / 3 complex interactions , we performed multisignal sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation [ 29 ] . Here , sedimentation was fol - lowed using Raleigh interference signals and absorbance at 492 nm . Gmf1 was tagged with GFP ( referred to as Gmf1 - GFP ) [ 19 ] , providing a unique signal at 492 nm . From sedimentation velocity data for these two signals ( Figure S3 ) , diffusion - deconvoluted sedimentation coefﬁcient distributions , c ( s ) , were constructed for yeast Arp2 / 3 complex and Gmf1 - GFP separately ( Figure 5A ) . Free yeast Arp2 / 3 complex showed a sedimentation coefﬁcient of 9 . 4S ( Table S3 ) , similar to the 9 . 2S sedimentation coefﬁcient reported for bovine Arp2 / 3 complex [ 30 ] . Free Gmf1 - GFP sediments substantially more slowly than Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 5A ) , consistent with it being present as a monomeric species . Similar experiments were performed for mixtures of Gmf1 - GFP and Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( Figures S3D and S3E ) , and multicomponent spectrally and diffusion - deconvoluted sedimentation coefﬁcient distri - butions , c k ( s ) , were ﬁt for Arp2 / 3 complex and Gmf1 - GFP ( Figure 5B ) . These distributions show that Arp2 / 3 complex sediments more rapidly in the presence of Gmf1 - GFP ( Fig - ure 5B ; Table S3 ) , and that a portion of Gmf1 - GFP cosedi - ments with Arp2 / 3 complex . By optimizing the ratio of Gmf1 - GFP that cosediments with Arp2 / 3 complex in ﬁtting ( Figures S3F and S3G ) , we estimated the stoichiometry of Gmf1 - GFP association with Arp2 / 3 complex . This was performed for a range of Gmf1 - GFP con - centrations in the presence of approximately 700 nM Arp2 / 3 complex . The observed stoichiometries ( Table S3 ; Figure S3J ) indicate two binding sites for Gmf1 on Arp2 / 3 complex . In particular , a stoichiometry of two Gmf1 - GFPs per Arp2 / 3 com - plex is seen when 3 . 5 m M unbound Gmf1 - GFP is present . Sub - stoichiometric concentrations of Gmf1 - GFP bound Arp2 / 3 complex completely , consistent with the ﬁrst binding site having a K D tighter than 30 nM ( Figure S3H ) . At high Gmf1 - GFP concentrations , additional bound and free Gmf1 - GFP is observed ( Figure 5B ) , consistent with a second , lower - afﬁnity binding site . Assuming two asymmetric binding sites for GMF on Arp2 / 3 complex and using isotherms from effective particle theory [ 31 ] , the K D of the second Gmf1 - GFP binding site is esti - mated to be w 2 m M ( Figures S3I and S3J ; Table S3 ) . Next , we measured the Arp2 / 3 complex binding afﬁnities of selected Gmf1 mutants using the ﬂuorescence anisotropy of Gmf1 - GFP in the presence of yeast Arp2 / 3 complex . Gmf1 - GFP bound to Arp2 / 3 complex with a K D of 13 6 2 nM ( Fig - ure 5C ) . This is consistent with the high - afﬁnity association revealed by analytical ultracentrifugation . We then compared the abilities of untagged wild - type and mutant Gmf1 proteins to compete with Gmf1 - GFP for binding Arp2 / 3 complex by monitoring the decrease in anisotropy of Gmf1 - GFP . Competition with wild - type unlabeled Gmf1 demonstrated that it bound about as strongly as Gmf1 - GFP , A B C D Figure 3 .

Current Biology Vol 23 No 12 1040 with a K D of 10 6 3 nM ( Figure 5D ; Table S2 ) . Gmf1 - 16 ( 11 6 3 nM ) and Gmf1 - 101 ( 10 6 3 nM ) were unaffected in their ability to bind Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 5D ; Table S2 ) , suggesting that site 2 does not play a role in directly binding Arp2 / 3 complex . Conversely , Gmf1 - 20 ( 210 6 50 nM ) was strongly defective in binding ( Figure 5D ; Table S2 ) . However , Gmf1 - 17 , also in site 1 and defective in Arp2 / 3 inhibition , bound about as strongly as wild - type ( 10 6 4 nM ; Figure 5D ; Table S2 ) ( see Discussion ) . Gmf1 Interacts with Arp2 , Arp3 , and Arc40 Subunits of Arp2 / 3 Complex To identify Arp2 / 3 complex subunits ( Arcs ) directly contacting or in close proximity to GMF , we chemically crosslinked Gmf1 to Arp2 / 3 complex . Crosslinking between Arp2 / 3 complex subunits was prevented by decorating Gmf1 with N - hydroxy - sulfosuccinimide ( sulfo - NHS ) before mixing with Arp2 / 3 com - plex . A number of new bands were observed that were missing from an unreacted sample of Arp2 / 3 complex alone , unmodi - ﬁed Gmf1 alone , decorated Gmf1 alone , and Arp2 / 3 complex mixed with unmodiﬁed Gmf1 ( Figure 6A ) . Blotting with a Gmf1 antibodies revealed several new , high - molecular - weight ( MW ) bands of discrete sizes , consistent with crosslinking to the larger subunits of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 6B ) . Comparison of silver - stained intensity of reacted and unreacted samples of Arp2 / 3 complex showed that the unmodiﬁed Arp3 and ArpC1 / Arc40 bands have detectable decreases in intensity . Blotting with a Arp3 ( Figure 6C ) , a Arp2 ( Figure 6D ) , and a Arc40 ( Fig - ure 6E ) showed that the new higher - MW bands contained each of these proteins . In contrast , very little crosslinking was apparent when blotting with a Arc35 ( Figure 6F ) . The remaining Arp2 / 3 complex subunits did not show detectable decreases in intensity and were not further explored . From these data , we conclude that there are GMF binding sites on , or proximal to , Arp2 , Arp3 , and Arc40 . Intriguingly , these sub - units are the same ones that bind VCA [ 30 , 33 – 35 ] , and we observed that VCA can compete with GMF for binding to Arp2 / 3 complex in a ﬂuorescence anisotropy - based assay ( Figure S4 ) . These results are also consistent with competitive Arp2 / 3 complex binding observed between Schizosaccharomyces pombe VCA and GMF [ 21 ] . Discussion To address the mechanistic and structural basis for GMF’s effects , we have performed a biochemical characterization , which leads to a model for its mechanism and interaction with both free Arp2 / 3 complex and Arp2 / 3 complex in the context of a ﬁlament branch junction . Although our study focused on yeast Gmf1 , we extended the key ﬁndings to mammalian GMF homologs . This suggests that these Arp2 / 3 complex regulatory functions and mechanisms are widely conserved . Below , we consider each of these conclusions . GMF Site 1 Interacts with the Arp2 / 3 Complex and Mediates Nucleation Inhibition Our model for GMF interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex is highly informed by previous work on coﬁlin . The two actin binding sites allow each coﬁlin molecule to bind two adjacent subunits in an actin ﬁlament [ 12 – 14 , 17 , 36 ] . These interactions lead to severing and creation of ends that accelerate disas - sembly [ 10 , 37 ] . Coﬁlin also uses site 1 to bind G - actin ( at the barbed end of the monomer ) and inhibit nucleotide exchange [ 27 , 38 , 39 ] . Two of our Gmf1 mutants ( Gmf1 - 17 and Gmf1 - 20 ) were designed to mimic mutations in site 1 that disrupted coﬁlin binding to G - actin ( Figures 1 and S1 ) [ 23 ] . Both of these mutants disrupted the ability of Gmf1 to inhibit nucleation by Arp2 / 3 complex in solution ( Figure 3 ) . Because Gmf1 binds strongly to Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 5 ; K D 10 – 13 nM ) but lacks detectable afﬁnity for monomeric actin ( [ 19 ] ; S . B . P . , unpub - lished data ) , these results suggest that Gmf1 inhibits nucle - ation by binding to the Arp subunits Arp2 and / or Arp3 in a manner similar to how coﬁlin interacts with G - actin . Consistent with this view , Gmf1 - 20 was defective in binding Arp2 / 3 com - plex when measured by ﬂuorescence anisotropy ( Figure 5 ) . Gmf1 - 17 was not impaired in binding to Arp2 / 3 complex ( Table S2 ) , suggesting that this less - conserved part of the site 1 is not essential for the interaction ( Figure 5 ) or does not affect the binding site reported on by the ﬂuorescence anisotropy assay . Surprisingly , Gmf1 - 17 and Gmf1 - 20 also appear to affect nucleation inhibition in two different ways ( Figure 3B ) , Gmf1 - 17 by altering the K i of the Arp2 / 3 complex - Gmf1 inter - action , and Gmf1 - 20 by changing the activity level at satura - tion . However , our crosslinking data show that Gmf1 interacts with both Arp2 and Arp3 ( Figure 6 ) , and our analytical ultracen - trifugation data reveal that there may be two Gmf1 binding sites on the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 5 ) . The speciﬁc defects observed for Gmf1 - 20 and Gmf1 - 17 in nucleation inhibition may therefore reﬂect altered interactions with two qualita - tively distinct binding sites on the Arp2 / 3 complex , which differentially contribute to nucleation inhibition . Although this A B C Figure 4 . Mammalian GMF g Has Debranching and Nucleation Inhibition Activities Similar to Yeast Gmf1 ( A ) Debranching activities of mouse GMF g and GMF g - 101 .

GMF Interactions with the Arp2 / 3 Complex 1041 explanation is plausible , there are too many model parameters to allow quantitative interpretation of these surprising results at this time . Despite these uncertainties , a qualitative structural mecha - nism for inhibition of nucleation by GMF can be inferred by using known structures to impose the analogy of the coﬁlin site 1 interaction with actin on the GMF interaction with Arp2 or Arp3 . We constructed molecular models of this interaction by docking the GMF g structure onto the structure of bovine Arp2 / 3 structure [ 28 ] , using the structure of the twinﬁlin - actin complex [ 27 ] as a guide for positioning GMF g on the barbed ends of Arp2 and / or Arp3 ( Figure 7 ) . We constructed several versions of the model , including GMF bound to Arp3 or Arp2 in the inactive conformation of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 28 , 40 ] . When GMF is engaged with Arp3 ( Figure 7A ) , there are no addi - tional contacts ; when engaged with Arp2 , GMF is also in con - tact with ArpC1 / Arc40 ( Figure 7B ) . GMF may bind to both sites at higher concentrations , explaining why both interactions were detected in our crosslinking experiments ( Figure 6 ) . There are no major clashes in either of these models , with the exception of a few residues in the Arp3 cleft , which could presumably reposition upon GMF binding . Therefore , this model is consistent with our scanning mutagenesis , crosslink - ing , and analytical ultracentrifugation data . How does GMF binding inhibit nucleation ? Gmf1 appears to bind to the same subunits in the Arp2 / 3 complex as VCA , and it can be competed off of the Arp2 / 3 complex by the addition of VCA ( Figure S4 ) . Thus , GMF may inhibit nucleation by inter - fering with NPF effects on the Arp2 / 3 complex . Furthermore , our EM data suggest that GMF alters the Arp2 / 3 complex conformation , shifting the distribution of particles from the closed to the open conformation ( Figure 3 ) . This is similar to the proposed mechanism of Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition by coronin [ 26 ] . GMF Site 2 Is Required Speciﬁcally for Debranching If Gmf1 uses site 1 to interact with the barbed end of Arp2 or Arp3 , as we have modeled ( Figure 7 ) , then its site 2 would interact with the ﬁrst actin subunit of the daughter ﬁlament , which forms a long - pitch dimer with one of the Arps . We modeled the interaction of GMF site 2 with the ﬁrst actin A B C D Figure 5 .

Current Biology Vol 23 No 12 1042 subunits of the daughter ﬁlament using the EM structure of coﬁlin - decorated actin ﬁlaments as a guide [ 13 ] ( Figures 7D and 7E ) . This model is supported by our scanning mutagenesis results . Gmf1 - 101 lies in a surface that overlaps with the coﬁ - lin mutant Cof1 - 6 , which impairs F - actin but not G - actin bind - ing [ 41 ] . This contact was also highlighted as being critical to coﬁlin - F - actin interactions in a molecular dynamics simulation [ 36 ] . Gmf1 - 101 was severely defective in debranching but had a near wild - type ability to inhibit nucleation by Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( Figure 3 ) and showed normal binding to Arp2 / 3 complex in solution ( Figure 5 ) . These observations support our struc - tural model , which predicts that the surface perturbed by Gmf1 - 101 is positioned away from Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 7 ) and in contact with the ﬁrst daughter actin ( Figures 7D and 7E ) . In sum , our model proposes that GMF debranches ﬁla - ments through separate interactions with Arp3 and / or Arp2 , mediated by site 1 , and through interactions with actin medi - ated by site 2 ( Figure 7F ) . The mechanism of debranching therefore appears to be related to actin severing by coﬁlin . Coﬁlin binding to ﬁlaments stabilizes a conformation in which Figure 7 .

Arp2 / 3 subunits are colored as follows : Arp2 , red ; Arp3 , orange ; ArpC1 , green ; ArpC2 , aqua ; ArpC3 , magenta ; ArpC4 , dark blue ; ArpC5 , yellow . There are twoproposed sites , one interactingwith Arp3 ( A ) and one interacting with Arp2 and ARPC1 / Arc40 ( B ) . Details of the modeling are in Supple - mental Experimental Procedures . In both models , residues from the site 1 mutations Gmf1 - 17 ( light cyan spheres ) and Gmf1 - 20 ( light pink spheres ) contact Arp2 / 3 complex , but resi - dues from the site 2 mutation Gmf1 - 101 project away from the complex ( light green spheres ) . Arp2 / 3 complex subunit surfaces are rendered using a 4 A˚ Gaussian blur . ( C ) A model for GMF inhibition of actin nucleation mediated by WASp VCA domain and Arp2 / 3 complex . Inhibition is hypothesized to occur through competition between site 1 of GMF and the C helix of VCA ( represented by curvy white line ) for the same binding surface and through alteration of Arp2 / 3 complex conformation .

Arp2 / 3 complex subunit surfaces are rendered using an 8 A˚ Gaussian blur . Actin is shown in gray surface . ( F ) AmodelofGMF - induceddebranchingofactin ﬁlaments in which contacts made by both site 1 and site 2 are required . GMF binding to the Arp2 / ArpC1 binding site is shown as the contact site for simplicity . GMF engagement causes a conformational change ( white star ) , resulting in disassembly of the branch ( right side of arrow ) . actin subdomain 2 is partially displaced from the adjacent subunit , which may lead to severing [ 13 ] . Similarly in our model , GMF binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex at a branch junction requires partial displacement of subdomain 2 of the daughter ﬁlament actins from Arp2 and Arp3 . Thus , GMF may stabilize a struc - ture with weakened daughter ﬁlament - Arp2 / 3 complex inter - actions , leading to dissociation of the daughter ﬁlament . A ﬁnal point to consider is that while GMF is a dedicated debranching factor that does not sever ﬁlaments at other loca - tions , ultimately its functions must be considered alongside those of coﬁlin . Coﬁlin binds cooperatively to ﬁlament sides and induces severing events at the boundaries of coﬁlin - deco - rated and bare regions , leading to ﬁlament fragmentation [ 10 , 15 , 37 ] . At higher saturation , this decoration also appears to disrupt Arp2 / 3 complex binding , inducing debranching . In the cellular context , it seems likely that both factors contribute to debranching [ 16 , 17 ] . An important future goal will be to determine how GMF and coﬁlin inﬂuence each other and function together to regulate actin ﬁlament debranching and severing .
