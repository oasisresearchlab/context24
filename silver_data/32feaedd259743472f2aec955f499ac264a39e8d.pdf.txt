Stress was ﬁ rst named as the general adaptation syndrome to de ﬁ ne a process when the body confronts noxious agents . Nearly a century has passed since Hans Selye ﬁ rst introduced the word stress in 1936 , and this brilliant idea about stress has helped an entirely new ﬁ eld to be forged and attracted thou - sands of researchers to work on the biological mechanism of stress . Now stress is extended to the ﬁ eld of psychology and rede ﬁ ned as the presence of acute or persistent physiological or psychological threats to the organism that result in signif - icant strain on the body ’ s compensatory systems . In face of stress , the ﬁ rst reaction of the body is an alarm reaction , preparing the body to “ ﬁ ght or ﬂ ight , ” as was motivated by the emotional changes , such as fear ( ﬂ ight ) and anger ( ﬁ ght ) [ 1 , 2 ] . Nowadays , it is found that emotional stress a ﬀ ects the organism even more seriously , and most of the mental diseases are due to stress - induced emotional changes , which can induce signi ﬁ cant strains to the body . Folkman et al . proposed that there are two kinds of emotional changes [ 3 ] : the ﬁ rst is related to threat and fearful emotion , which motivates withdrawal and ﬂ ight behavior ; and the second is related to coping with the sit - uation , when the organism activates energy in the body to cope with the situation and show angry emotions . Thus , fear and anger are two basic emotions at stressful events : fear is the scariness at the threat , while anger is trying to cope with the stressful situation [ 4 ] . Lazarus proposed that stress depends on cognitive appraisals of situation [ 5 ] . He distinguished two kinds of appraisals : the ﬁ rst appraisal is unconscious and fast activating , which is related to harm and threat and induces fearful emotion to motivate avoid - ance and withdrawal ; the second is conscious and con - cerned with coping with the uncontrolled situation . In the face of threat , the organism was scared at ﬁ rst and showed fearful emotions ; then to cope with the threats , the organism collects energy in the body to “ ﬁ ght or ﬂ ight ” . Therefore , fear and anger usually come in a tan - dem at the stressful events [ 6 ] . Fear and anger are hard to be detached and are two sides of the same coin [ 5 ] . Lazarus suggested another stage of appraisal after coping with the situation ( called reappraisal ) . At this stage , an indi - vidual employs two kinds of reappraisals : problem - focused ( cognition ) , and emotion - focused . If the organism can cope successfully with the stressful situation , the organism will get positive emotions and be happy . If the organism failed to cope with the situation , the organism would get negative emotions and be sad . Therefore , a stressful event - induced emotion will go through “ fear - anger - joy or sadness ” emotion ﬂ ow . If the organism cannot overcome the stressful events , like the chronic stresses , some mental disorders will appear . The relations of the process with the emotional changes and some mental disorders were shown in our previous edi - torial . Therefore , when something happens , people will ﬁ rst evaluate whether it is dangerous ( fear / anger ) or not ( calm ) and next evaluate if they ﬁ t into our need ( happy / sad ) [ 7 ] . This hypothesis is exactly consistent with Lazarus ’ reap - praisal theory about happiness or sadness [ 5 ] : the happy HindawiNeural Plasticity Volume 2018 , Article ID 5382537 , 3 pages https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1155 / 2018 / 5382537 and sad emotion are related to the success or failure to cope with stressful situations . The mechanisms whereby external stressors a ﬀ ecting brain function have been the subject of extensive study over the past half a century . It is well known that the major function of NE is “ ﬁ ght ( anger ) or ﬂ ight ( fear ) ” [ 8 , 9 ] . The stress - induced neural plasticity undoubtedly a ﬀ ects the brain function and may prompt functional alternations in mental disorders . Indeed , stress - induced neuroplasticity plays a critical role in almost all of the mental disorders , and stress has become a synonym for diverse terms of neg - ative emotions , such as depression , anxiety . In previous special issues , we already collected 9 papers on stress - induced neural plasticity and some neuro - logical diseases . Because of its popularity , we were invited to hold this issue as the annual topic in 2018 , and we are glad to get 31 submissions , and 11 of which are accepted for publication . These reviews and experimental papers present more evidence about stress . In the experimental paper “ The Neural Basis of Fear Promotes Anger and Sadness Counteracts Anger , ” J . Zhan et al . probed into the relationships about basic emotions and reported that fear leads to anger . They tested this hypothesis with MRI and found that the selective involve - ment of di ﬀ erent brain regions in di ﬀ erent basic emotions might be the reason for the relationship between the basic emotions . For example , they found that the posterior insula ( PI ) is involved in sadness , while the anterior insula ( AI ) is involved in fear . Their interesting data helped explain the relationship between the basic emotions : fear - anger - sadness . In the review paper “ Persistent Stress - Induced Neuro - plastic Changes in the Locus Coeruleus / Norepinephrine System , ” O . Borodovitsyna et al . reviewed papers about neural mechanisms underlying stress , especially locus coer - uleus / norepinephrine system . In this paper , they reported how stress changes the structure and function of LC from a genetic , cellular , and neuronal circuitry / transmission per - spective . They further linked stress to altered LC function and pathogenesis of posttraumatic stress disorder . Chronic stress often induces neural plasticity in the brain at molecular , cellular level . In the experimental paper “ Recovery of Chronic Stress - Triggered Changes of Hippo - campal Glutamatergic Transmission , ” M . Lin et al . probed into the dynamic changes in excitatory transmission in the hippocampus and investigated the spontaneous recovery of spatial memory function and glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus after chronic stress . They found that chronic unpredicted mild stress transiently increased AMPA receptor GluA2 / 3 subunit expression , together with elevated PICK - 1 protein expression . They further probed into the spontaneous recovery after the stress is removed . In the experimental paper “ Metabolic Changes Associ - ated with a Rat Model of Diabetic Depression Detected by Ex Vivo 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in the Prefrontal Cortex , Hippocampus , and Hypothalamus , ” K . Liu et al . reported stress - induced depression in diabetic depression . They used magnetic resonance spectroscopy and immunohistochemistry to investigate the metabolic and pathological changes in the rat brain and found that the levels of glutamate decrease at depression , which are pos - sibly due to dysfunction of neurons and astrocytes . In the experimental paper “ Context and Time Matter : E ﬀ ects of Emotion and Motivation on Episodic Memory Overtime , ” Q . Sun et al . compared the reaction times about reward stimuli , punishment stimuli , and stressful stimuli in human subjects and found that stressful stimuli are highly arousing and can trigger more e ﬃ cient memory consolidation . In the experimental paper “ Direct Electrophysiological Mapping of Shape - Induced A ﬀ ective Perception , ” Y . Li et al . reported a very interesting behavior and ERP study about emotional arousal of pleasant and unpleasant stimuli . Consistent with Lazarus ’ s theory of two processing pathways of the brain about stressful stimuli and hedonic stimuli , they found that stressful stimuli , such as angry face , can induce faster and larger response in the earlier ERP responses , par - ticular P1 , N1 . In the experimental paper “ TLR4 - NF - ĸ B Signal Involved in Depressive - Like Behaviors and Cytokine Expression of Frontal Cortex and Hippocampus in Stressed C57BL / 6 and ob / ob Mice , ” Y . Wang et al . reported that elevated levels of cytokines such as interleu - kin - ( IL - ) 1 β , IL - 6 , and tumor necrosis factor - α ( TNF - α ) are closely associated with pathology of depression in obe - sity mice during stress processing . In the experimental paper “ Danshen - Honghua Amelio - rates Stress - Induced Menopausal Depression in Rats , ” S . Gu et al . reported neurotransmitter and sex hormone changes in an animal model of menopause depression . In addition , they found that a kind of Chinese herb can help treat menopause depression . This paper will help understand the pathogenesis of perimenstrual depression . In the experimental paper “ Language and Sensory Neural Plasticity in the Superior Temporal Cortex of the Deaf , ” M . Que et al . showed plausible neural pathways for auditory reorganization for deaf patients . They probed into the correlations of activations of the reorganized cor - tical areas with developmental factors and provided unique evidence towards the understanding of neural circuits involved in cross - modal plasticity . In the experimental paper “ Examination Stress Results in Attentional Bias and Altered Neural Reactivity in Test - Anxious Individuals , ” X . Zhang et al . studied the test stress in college students , using ERP ( event - related potentials ) . They found that test stress can induce functional perturba - tions of brain circuitry that reacts rapidly to test threat . In the experimental paper “ Relationship between Insulin Levels and Nonpsychotic Dementia : A Systematic Review and Meta - Analysis , ” Q . Pan et al . reported a spe - cial relationship about stress with dementia in human subjects . They found that dementia is related with insulin , which can induce a variety of neural plasticities , such as apoptosis in neurons , thus cognitive functions , such as learning and memory . Collectively , these studies demonstrate that stress can induce many critical changes in many mental disorders . We hope that this special issue will stimulate interests in the ﬁ eld of the mechanism of stress inducing the neural plasticity and 2 Neural Plasticity will help achieve a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism of stress - induced mental disorders .
