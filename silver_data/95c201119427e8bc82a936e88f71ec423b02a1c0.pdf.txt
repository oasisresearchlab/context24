Pollard , Yale University , New Haven , CT , and approved November 25 , 2009 ( received for review October 2 , 2009 ) Myosin - Is are molecular motors that link cellular membranes to the actin cytoskeleton , where they play roles in mechano - signal trans - duction and membrane trafficking . Some myosin - Is are proposed to act as force sensors , dynamically modulating their motile proper - ties in response to changes in tension . In this study , we examined force sensing by the widely expressed myosin - I isoform , myo1b , which is alternatively spliced in its light chain binding domain ( LCBD ) , yielding proteins with lever arms of different lengths . We found the actin - detachment kinetics of the splice isoforms to be extraordinarily tension - sensitive , with the magnitude of tension sensitivity to be related to LCBD splicing . Thus , in addition to reg - ulating step - size , motility rates , and myosin activation , the LCBD is a key regulator of force sensing . We also found that myo1b is sub - stantially more tension - sensitive than other myosins with similar length lever arms , indicating that different myosins have different tension - sensitive transitions . ATPase ∣ kinetics ∣ optical tweezers ∣ single molecule ∣ molecular motor Tension sensing by myosin motors is important for numerous cel - lular processes , including control of force and energy utilization in contracting muscles ( 1 ) , transport of cellular cargos ( 2 , 3 ) , detection of auditory stimuli ( 4 ) , and control of cell shape ( 5 ) . Myosins have evolved different tension sensitivities tuned for these diverse cellular tasks ( 6 ) , thus it is important to determine the mechanisms and regulation of force sensing within the myosin superfamily . We recently demonstrated that the widely expressed myosin - I isoform , myo1b , is exquisitely sensitive to tension ( 7 ) . Myo1b transitions from a low duty - ratio to a high duty - ratio motor at very low opposing forces ( < 1 pN ) . Evidence suggests that tension sensing occurs as stress on actomyo1b prevents the rotation of the myo1b lever arm , which inhibits ADP release and subsequent ATP binding and actin detachment ( 2 , 7 , 8 ) . Myo1b is alternatively spliced during development and in various tissues within its LCBD , which is the region of the motor that acts as the lever - arm ( 9 ) . Splicing yields proteins with six ( myo1b a ) , five ( myo1b b ) , or four ( myo1b c ) nonidentical calmodulin - binding IQ motifs that are spliced such that the fourth IQ motif exists as a hybrid with IQ - 5 or IQ - 6 in the two shorter isoforms ( Fig . 1 ) . The LCBD is a key mechanical component in the force production pathway ( 10 , 11 ) , so alterna - tive splicing may be a mechanism to tune the mechanical proper - ties of myo1b to varied physiological needs without changing basal ATPase kinetic or cargo - binding properties of the motor . Indeed , myosins II and V have different sized LCBDs and display different force sensitivities ( 2 , 8 ) . Therefore , we tested the pos - sibility that alternative splicing regulates the tension sensitivities of recombinant myo1b splice isoforms . Because characterization of myosins with different length LCBDs provides an opportunity to better define the molecular basis of force sensing in all myo - sins , we also investigated the mechanical properties of a construct that contains a single IQ motif ( myo1b IQ ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Results Step and Substep Sizes of Myo1b Splice Isoforms . Single actomyosin interactions were acquired using the three - bead configuration ( 12 , 13 ) , in which a single actin filament , suspended between two beads held by separate optical traps , is brought close to the surface of a pedestal bead that is sparsely coated with myo1b . Myo1b proteins were site - specifically attached to the streptavidin - coated pedestal beads via a biotinylation tag posi - tioned directly C - terminal to the LCBD ( 14 ) . Step sizes of the myo1b proteins were determined at low trap stiffnesses ( ∼ 0 . 022 pN ∕ nm ) to minimize stress on the actomyo1b during the working stroke . A low ATP concentration ( 1 μ M ) was used in the step - size measurements to prolong actin attachments , allowing for clear identification of unitary interactions and pre - cise determination of step sizes ( 7 ) . A stage - position feedback system was also used to decrease low - frequency vibrations that were previously apparent in long actin attachments ( 7 ) ( Fig . S1 ) . The myo1b working - stoke occurs in two substeps , with the first and second substeps most likely accompanying phosphate and ADP release , respectively ( 7 , 15 ) . Thus , we recorded working stroke displacements 50 ms after attachment and 50 ms before detachment and plotted distributions of total and substep sizes ( Fig . 2 A ) . We also determined average step sizes by ensemble averaging the time courses of unitary interactions ( Fig . 2 B ) ( 8 ) . Ensemble averages created by synchronizing interactions at their start times report the displacement of the first substep , Myo1b IQ Myo1b c Myo1b b Myo1b a 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 / 5 6 1 2 3 4 / 6 1 Biotin Biotin Biotin Biotin Motor Motor Motor Motor Myo1ba HGTQARKERR RLKDEARNKH AIAVIWAFWL GSKARRELKR LKEEARRKHA VAVIWAYWLG LKVRREYRKF FRA 863 Myo1bb HGTQ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The distributions of steps and substeps of individual interac - tions are well described by broad Gaussian distributions that center on values that are similar to the average displacements obtained by ensemble averaging ( Fig . 2 ) . Subpopulations are not apparent in the distributions , so the ensemble averaged traces are likely reporting the mean behavior of the unitary events . The standard deviations of the distributions of the first substeps are broader than the second substeps ( Fig . 2 A , Table S1 ) . This broad - ening is likely due to variability in the positions on the actin filaments to which myosins bind prior to the first substep . Total step and substep sizes are not linearly related to the number of IQ motifs in the constructs ( Fig . 3 ) , as found for other myosins ( 16 ) . Total step size of myo1b c is significantly larger than myo1b IQ ( p < 0 . 0001 , unpaired two - tailed t - test ) , but total myo1b b displacements are smaller than myo1b c ( p ¼ 0 . 090 ) , even though myo1b b binds an additional calmodulin ( 14 ) . If we assume that the LCBDs of myo1b IQ and myo1b c act as rigid lever arms , the slope of a line drawn between their total steps would predict a step size of ∼ 15 nm for myo1b b , which is 1 . 7 - fold larger than experimentally determined . A projection of the actual myo1b b step - size to this line results in the prediction that myo1b b has an LCBD with an effective length of ∼ 3 IQ motifs ( Fig . 3 , dashed line ) . Projection of the myo1b a step size to the same line predicts an LCBD length of ∼ 5 IQ motifs . Thus , as measured under the low - load conditions of the experiment , it appears that the IQ - 5 and the first half of IQ - 6 introduce a structural feature into the LCBD that decreases the effective lever arm size .

Force - Dependent Actin - Detachment Kinetics . We measured the force - dependence of actomyo1b attachment durations using a feedback system that applies a dynamic load to the actomyo1b to keep the actin near its isometric position ( Fig . 4 ) ( 7 , 13 ) . Experiments were performed in the presence of 50 μ M ATP to ensure that the rate of ATP binding did not limit the rate of detachment ( 7 , 17 ) . Long attachment durations at higher forces are apparent in the time traces of all four myo1b proteins , but it is clear that the shorter isoforms have shorter attachment durations ( Fig . 4 ) . Attachment durations of myo1b a , myo1b b , and myo1b c in - creased until a plateau was reached , at which point the attach - ment durations appear to be force - independent ( Fig . 4 ) . The force at which this plateau is reached increases with decreasing number of IQ motifs . The attachment durations of myo1b IQ are substantially less force - dependent , and a plateau is not as appar - ent over the range of forces probed in these experiments . We modeled actomyo1b detachment with force - dependent ( k g ) and force - independent rates ( k i ) : Attached → k g Detached k i ↓ Detached and the force dependence of the detachment rate ( k det ) was calculated as k det ð F Þ ¼ k g 0 e − F · d det kT þ k i [ 1 ] where k g 0 is the rate of k g in the absence of force , F is force , k is the Boltzmann constant , T is temperature , and d det is the distance parameter , which reports the distance to the transition state of the force - sensitive step and is a measure of force sensitivity ( 7 , 18 ) . Since the attachment durations are expected to be exponen - tially distributed at each force ( Eq . 1 ) , we fit the data and deter - mined the confidence limits using a maximum likelihood routine that uses a modified exponential probability distribution function ( see Methods ) . We globally fit the four attachment - duration datasets to determine isoform - specific values for d det with the assumption that k g 0 and k i are the same for the four pro - teins ( Fig . 4 ) . The best fit d det values for the four myo1b constructs are dif - ferent and are linearly related to the number of IQ motifs ( Fig . 3 ) . The effect of these differences on the force dependencies is clearly illustrated via plots of k det versus force ( Fig . 4 ) and via plots of the dependence of attachment lifetime on splice isoform and force ( Fig . 5 ) . Myo1b a , myo1b b , and myo1b c are extraordi - narily force - sensitive , with k det decreasing 10 - fold within < 0 . 25 pN of resisting force ( Fig . 4 ) . Myo1b IQ is substantially less force - sensitive , requiring > 2 . 5 pN resisting force to obtain a 10 - fold decrease in k det . The best fit value of k g 0 ( 0 . 51 ð(cid:1) 0 . 11 Þ s − 1 ) from the global fit is within ∼ 2 - fold of the rate of ADP release in the absence of load as measured by biochemical methods ( 1 . 0 s − 1 , 22 °C ) ( 17 ) , and the value obtained for k i ( 0 . 011 ðþ 0 . 0025 ∕ − 0 . 0017 Þ s − 1 ) is within twofold of the value determined previously for myo1b b ( k i ¼ 0 . 021 s − 1 ) ( 7 ) .

However , use of a stage feedback system that effectively removes this noise did not eliminate the force - independent pathway or dramatically affect the rate of k i . Thus , we investigated whether this pathway is the result of the basal detachment of myo1b from actin . The rate of detachment of myo1b IQ from pyrene - labeled actin was measured in the absence of force by stopped - flow kinetics ( Fig . S2 ) . The detachment rate in the presence of ADP ( k off ¼ 0 . 015 (cid:1) 0 . 00011 s − 1 ) is remarkably similar to the best fit value obtained for k i ð 0 . 011 ðþ 0 . 0025 ∕ − 0 . 0017 Þ s − 1 ) , and is fourfold faster than in the absence of nucleotide ( k off ¼ 0 . 0036 (cid:1) 0 . 00036 s − 1 ) . Therefore , we identify the force - independent detachment pathway ( Scheme 1 ) as the dissociation of myo1b in an ADP - like state from actin . Discussion The key finding of these studies is that myo1b splice isoforms have significantly different force - dependent kinetics of actin detachment , and the d det values are linearly related to the number of IQ motifs ( Fig . 3 ) . The d det values are larger than the average displacements of the second substep ( Fig . 3 ) , indicating that the force - sensitive transition is not on a coordinate that is in line with this substep displacement . Interestingly , the d det values for myo1b IQ and myo1b c are comparable in size to their overall step sizes ( Fig . 3 ) , suggesting that for these constructs , the force - sensitive transition has a trajectory similar to the overall power - stroke . The overall step sizes of myo1b a and myo1b b are smaller than the d det values ( Fig . 3 ) , yet if the step sizes of myo1b a and myo1b b followed the same step - size trend as myo1b IQ and myo1b c , the values of the overall step sizes and distance para - meters would be similar . We propose that in the presence of load , myo1b IQ and myo1b c dwell in a strong - binding state with an ADP - like affinity in which the lever arm has not rotated , and the force - sensitive transition requires the rotation of the lever arm with a magnitude that is similar to the overall step size . This mechanism is different from what has been found for myosin II ( 8 ) and myosin V ( 2 ) , which have d det values that correlate well with the size of their ADP - release - coupled substeps . Thus , despite the similarity of myo1b ’ s two - step working stroke to myosins II and V , myo1b likely dwells in a different conformational state under load which results in increased force sensitivity . We do not know why d det values for myo1b a and myo1b b are larger than their overall step sizes ( Fig . 3 ) . The IQ motifs spliced into myo1b a and myo1b b do not contain the isoleucine - glutamine or arginine - glycine pairs of residues that have been shown to con - tribute to the binding of the C - and N - terminal lobes of calmod - ulin , and binding measurements show that calmodulin affinities for these motifs are weaker than for the canonical motifs ( 14 ) . However , stoichiometry measurements show that myo1b b binds five calmodulins and myo1b a binds 5 – 6 calmodulins at the cal - modulin concentrations used in our experiments ( 20 μ M ) ( 14 ) . Nevertheless , weak calmodulin binding to the spliced IQ motifs may indicate an unusual LCBD structure , which may result in the shorter than expected step sizes at low loads . It is unlikely that the structural features introduced via splicing result in increased step sizes with load ( which might lead to larger d det values ) , as plots of the second substep size as a function of force do not show load - dependent step - size increases for any of the constructs ( Fig . S3 ) . Rather , splicing may introduce a “ hook ” or a “ bend ” in the LCBDs of myo1b a and myo1b b that may amplify torsional motions of the LCBD that are on the path to the transition state but are not apparent in the displacement measurements ( 19 – 21 ) . Further structural and mechanical characterizations of the LCBD are required to resolve this issue . Our results indicate that alternative splicing increases the range of force sensitivities of the proteins translated from the myo1b gene . Given the very long actin - attachment lifetimes of myo1b under low loads ( < 1 pN , Fig . 4 ) , we propose that myo1b ’ s function is to generate and sustain tension for extended periods of time , rather than to rapidly transport cellular cargos . Alterna - tive splicing tunes the mechanical properties of myo1b for diverse mechanical challenges , while maintaining the protein ’ s basal kinetic and cargo - binding properties . These results highlight the crucial role of the LCBD in defining the force sensitivity of myosins . These results also reinforce the finding that there is diversity in the mechanisms of force sensing within the myosin superfamily ( 2 , 8 , 13 ) . Materials and Methods Proteins and Reagents . Myo1b expression constructs were prepared as described ( 14 ) . All myo1b splice isoform constructs were truncated after the final IQ motif in the light chain binding domain ( Fig . 1 ) . An additional nonnative construct ( myo1b IQ ) consisting of the motor and first IQ motif was also prepared . A 15 - amino acid AviTag sequence for site - specific biotinylation and a FLAG sequence for purification were inserted at the C termini of the four constructs ( 14 , 22 ) . Myo1b constructs were expressed and purified from Sf9 cells that were coinfected with virus containing recombinant myo1b and calmodulin as described ( 23 ) . Concentrated protein was site - specifically biotinylated with 20 μ g ∕ ml biotin ligase in the presence of 10 mM MgATP and 50 μ M biotin at 30°C for 1 h . Free biotin and ATP were removed by MonoQ column chromatography and dialysis . Protein integrity was assessed by a standard motility assay ( 14 , 24 ) . The same protein preparations were used to acquire step sizes and distance parameters , thus thelower myo1b b step size isnot the results of inadvertent switching of isoforms . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared as described ( 25 ) . Actin concen - trations were determined by absorbance at 290 nm , ε 259 ¼ 26 ; 600 M − 1 cm − 1 . Actin for transient kinetics experiments was labeled with pyrenyl iodoaceta - mide ( pyrene - actin ) and gel filtered ( 26 ) . All actin was stabilized with a molar equivalent of phalloidin ( Sigma ) . Calmodulin was expressed in bacteria and purified as described ( 27 ) . Single - Molecule Measurements . Single - molecule interactions were recorded using the three - bead assay geometry in a dual - beam optical trap system as described ( 7 , 13 ) . Beads and motility chambers were prepared as described in SI Text . Trap stiffnesses were ∼ 0 . 022 pN ∕ nm . N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) myosin - II beads were captured in separate optical traps , and bead - actin - bead dumbbells were assembled by contacting the trapped beads with single actin filaments . Bead - actin - bead assemblies were pretensioned to ∼ 2 . 5 pN and lowered onto the surface of a pedestal using a piezoelectric stage controller to scan for actomyo1b interactions . Upon observation of interactions , data were digitized with a 2 kHz sampling rate for 6 – 10 min intervals .

Force dependence of attachment lifetimes of the myo1b splice isoforms . Attachment lifetimes ( 1 ∕ k det ) of the four myo1b protein constructs were calculated using the values obtained from the MLE fit of the data in Fig . 4 to Eq . 1 .

PNAS ∣ January 12 , 2010 ∣ vol . 107 ∣ no . 2 ∣ 701 B I O C H E M I S T RY experiments were performed in KMg 25 ( 10 mM Mops , 25 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT ) . The force dependence of actomyo1b attachment lifetimes was measured using a feedback system that applies a dynamic load to the actomyo1b to keep the actinfilament near its isometric position during the myosin working stroke as described ( 7 , 13 ) . Briefly , changes in the force on the bead attached to the pointed end of the actin filament ( transducer bead ) were fed through an analog integrating feedback amplifier to an acousto - optic deflector , which changed the position of the laser trap on the bead bound to the barbed end of the actin filament ( motor trap ) until the position of the trans - ducer bead was restored to its original position . The response time of the feedback loop in the absence of interactions was adjusted to 50 ms for each bead - actin - bead assembly . To control low - frequency stage - position fluctuations , an additional infra - red laser beam ( λ ¼ 830 nm , Point - Source ) was installed on the same beam path as the trapping laser , with the exception that after being collected and collimated by the condenser objective , the laser light was directed to a separate 4 - quadrant photodiode . We monitored the position of the pedestal on which the myo1b is attached , and controlled the x - axis ( i . e . , the long axis of the actin filament ) of the stage position using an analog integrating feedback amplifier . By incorporating this stage feedback system into our ex - periments , we can reduce fluctuations of the stage due to drift or mechanical vibration , thus reducing the noise in our force traces ( Fig . S1 ) . The start and endpoints of actomyo1b attachments were determined as described in SI Text . The best values for the parameters described in Eq . 1 were found using a maximum likelihood routine utilizing a modified exponential decay probability distribution function ( 28 ) . The log likelihood was minimized with a Nelson - Mead downhill simplex routine ( 28 ) . The function was sufficiently complex that the minimization had to be frequently restartedin order tofindthetrueglobalminimum . The restartalgorithmwas modified from an annealing routine sometimes used for multiple parameter fits ( 28 ) . The combination of these two algorithms allowed for a rapid con - vergence to the global minimum of the log likelihood function . Confidence intervals for each uniquely determined parameter were found by simulating thedatawithabootstraproutine ( 28 ) . Wegenerated 1 , 000suchdatasetsand independently fit them for all of the relevant parameters . In order to calcu - late the confidence interval of 90 % for a given parameter , the boundaries were determined in which 45 % of the simulated data were contained on either side of the value of the parameter from the actual data . The maximum and minimum confidence interval were then calculated from the upper and lower boundaries , respectively . Actomyo1b Dissociation Experiments . The detachment rates of myo1b IQ from pyrene - actin were determined with an Applied Photophysics ( Surrey , U . K . ) SX . 18MV stopped - flow fluorometer in the absence and presence of 25 μ M ADP . A 400 nm long - pass filter ( Oriel ) was used to monitor pyrene ( λ ex ¼ 365 nm ) fluorescence . Dissociation experiments were performed by mixing 0 . 5 μ M pyrene - actomyo1b IQ with 50 μ M unlabeled actin ( final concen - trations after mixing ) . Times courses of averaged experimental transients were fitted to a single exponential function using the software supplied with the stopped - flow . Reported errors are the standard error of the fit . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . We thank Tianming Lin for outstanding technical assistance , and Dr . Yale E . Goldman for helpful discussions .
