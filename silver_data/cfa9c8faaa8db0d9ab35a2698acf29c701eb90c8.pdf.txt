Purpose : Sodium fluorescein ( ‘fluorescein’ ) is the most commonly used diagnostic ophthalmic dye for clinical assessment of the ocular surface . An increase in fluorescein staining presents after the use of certain multi - purpose solutions ( MPS ) and contact lenses , which is a clinical phenomenon known as solution induced corneal staining ( SICS ) . The clinical relevance and mechanisms underpinning fluorescein staining however is conflicting in the literature . Currently a number of studies indicate fluorescein localises within cells that are healthy and metabolically active , in contrast to conventional thought that fluorescein staining of MPS treated cells is indicative of cellular toxicity ; however the precise mechanism underpinning fluorescein internalisation is unknown . The aim of this doctoral thesis was thus to investigate novel biological mechanisms mediating fluorescein uptake and to determine the chemical inducers of increased fluorescein staining . Methods : Spectrofluorimetry was used to analyse the fluorescence intensity of various fluorescein solutions and of tear samples after fluorescein application to the ocular surface . For assessment of fluorescein uptake in cell cultures exposed to test MPS , fluorescence microscopy was performed ; subsequently a high content analysis ( HCA ) microscopy methodology developed in this thesis , was used to enumerate fluorescein fluorescence intensity . The physiological state of cell cultures treated with a number of MPS and fluorescein were also assessed using propidium iodide ( PI ) , Caspase - 3 antibody for apoptosis analysis , metabolic activity assays and confocal microscopy . Endocytosis , macropinocytosis , and receptor - mediated uptake , mechanisms which previous to this work have not been investigated in association with SICS and fluorescein uptake , were studied using chemical inhibitors and serum starvation in cell culture , and then analysed by HCA . To study the hyperfluorescence inducing properties of MPS components , surfactant Tetronic 1107 ( an MPS surfactant component typically overlooked and not investigated as an inducer of SICS ) and Triton X - 100 ( a surfactant not found in MPS ) were exposed to cell cultures and after fluorescein treatment , were analysed by HCA ; metabolic activity assessment of identically treated cultures were also performed . Similarly , HCA and metabolic activity measurements were also performed in cell cultures treated with MPS biocides PHMB and Polyquaternium - 1 ( PQ - 1 ) . Results : Fluorescein fluorescence intensity was not affected by temperature , by alkali solvents , or by different MPS formulations ; concentration remains the primary factor by which fluorescein intensity is affected . It was seen that after 1 % w / v fluorescein instillation on the ocular surface , fluorescein concentration in tear samples significantly decreased within the first minute and decreased to as little as 0 . 0001 % w / v after 10 minutes . Fluorescence microscopy and HCA techniques revealed that on treatment with Biotrue® ( Bausch + Lomb , referred to as P - PQ1 - 1107 ) and ReNu Sensitive Multi - purpose Solution® ( Bausch + Lomb , referred to as P - 1107 ) , fluorescein uptake increased in cell cultures , as typically seen clinically . Also typically seen clinically , cell cultures treated with Opti - free Replenish® ( Alcon ; PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 ) and Complete Revitalens® ( AMO ; PQ1 - Alex - 904 ) did not induce hyperfluorescence . Significantly , only those cells treated with PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 exhibited an increase in PI and loss of metabolic activity . Additionally , given that no significant Caspase - 3 staining in all test MPS cells was seen by fluorescence microscopy and blebbing was only observed by confocal microscopy in P - PQ1 - 1107 treated cells , increased fluorescein hyperfluorescence is unlikely to be related to apoptosis . Study of various biological internalisation mechanisms revealed that dynamin ( a protein associated with endocytosis ) inhibition in P - PQ1 - 1107 or P - 1107 treated cells significantly decreases fluorescein uptake with no detrimental effect to cell metabolic activity . Interestingly , on quantifying fluorescein uptake in surfactant treated cells , a significant increase in hyperfluorescence was measured with only Tetronic 1107 at concentration 1 % w / v with no significant effect on cellular metabolic activity . In contrast , cell culture treatment with biocides PHMB , and PQ - 1 did not induce increased fluorescein uptake comparable to MPS P - PQ1 - 1107 or P - 1107 ; metabolic activity assays revealed that this is likely attributed to the decrease in cell metabolic activity exhibited with these biocides . Conclusions : The differential fluorescein staining associated clinically with four varied MPS was also seen in an unique in vitro model , allowing the subsequent study of the SICS phenomenon and the fundamental basis of fluorescein uptake . Using this in vitro model , it was seen that fluorescein internalisation is associated with the protein dynamin in healthy , metabolically active cells , and is unlikely to be mediated by apoptosis . Moreover , fluorescein uptake is induced by surfactant Tetronic 1107 and not biocides PHMB or PQ - 1 , which is in contrast to the popular belief that increased hyperfluorescence is induced by the biocide component of MPS . 18 Declaration No portion of the work referred to in the thesis has been submitted in support of an application for another degree or qualification of this or any other university or other institute of learning .

Background to thesis The fluorescent topical dye sodium fluorescein ( often referred to as fluorescein only ) is used to assess the integrity and health of the ocular surface . Once fluorescein is instilled on the eye , corneal and conjunctival staining ( or ‘hyperfluorescence’ ) is observed using a slit - lamp biomicroscope . The occurrence of fluorescein hyperfluorescence is typically associated with poor ocular health . In association with certain multi - purpose solutions ( MPS ) and contact lenses , ocular hyperfluorescence increases : a phenomenon known as solution induced corneal staining ( SICS ) . Although there are a number of hypotheses proposed for the mechanism underpinning such increased hyperfluorescence , it is in fact poorly understood . Given that fluorescein is the primary ophthalmic diagnostic dye used clinically , it is vital to fully understand the mechanisms underpinning fluorescein hyperfluorescence so as to improve clinical understanding of fluorescein staining and to better understand the relevance of SICS . There are three overall aims to this work , the first being to investigate how the ocular surface affects the intensity of fluorescein fluorescence . The second was to study the biological mechanisms underpinning fluorescein uptake in cell culture , and finally to identify chemical inducers of increased hyperfluorescence . The specific aims were : 1 . To identify potential physiochemical characteristics that may affect fluorescein fluorescence staining on the ocular surface . 2 . To develop an in vitro model of SICS that with exposure to MPS exhibits the same differential fluorescein fluorescence responses as demonstrated by these MPS clinically . 3 . To develop a method by which SICS can be quantified as a means to analyse the effect of MPS on fluorescein uptake in cells . 4 . To further study the association between hyperfluorescence and cellular health . 24 5 . To elucidate a specific uptake mechanism underpinning fluorescein staining . 6 . To identify , if any , a single MPS component responsible for increased hyperfluorescence . 1 . 2 . Thesis overview This thesis is organised into seven chapters . Chapters three through to six are formatted using the alternative journal thesis format in preparation for future publication : each of these chapters includes an abstract , introduction , methods , results and discussion section . A summary of each chapter is described below : Chapter 1 – Introduction to thesis aims and review of the current literature . Chapters 2 - This section details the standard and already established protocols regularly used throughout the thesis . Chapter 3 – This chapter describes the various methods explored for fluorescein quantification in cell culture , and explains the principal choice to use high content analysis ( HCA ) . Chapter 4 – Fluorescein at various concentrations and temperatures , interaction with varied pH and MPS were investigated as possible contributors to the fluorescence intensity of fluorescein observed on the ocular surface . These are evaluated using spectrofluorimetry and a novel method developed for the quantification of fluorescein concentration on the ocular surface . Chapter 5 - Murine fibroblasts ( L929 cells ) and human corneal cells ( HC cells ) are used to study the variable effects of different MPS on fluorescein uptake , and explore its effects on cellular health using necrosis , apoptosis and metabolic activity assays . Dynamin - dependent uptake is explored as a method of cellular fluorescein internalisation . Furthermore , non - ionic surfactants Tetronic 1107 and Triton X - 100 are investigated in both cell lines as hyperfluorescence inducers . 25 Chapter 6 – Change in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation , receptor mediated uptake and macropinocytosis are investigated as further mechanisms underpinning fluorescein uptake . The effect of biocides PHMB and Polyquaternium - 1 on cellular metabolic activity and fluorescein uptake are also studied . Chapter 7 - This chapter summarises the overall findings and limitations of this thesis , and discusses future work required in this field . 26 1 . 3 . The cornea and its function The cornea is a transparent dome - like structure on top of the iris , lens and anterior chamber , and accounts for approximately two - thirds of the eye refractive power ( Jacob 2016 ) . The cornea receives its nutrients from tear , aqueous and the perilimbal vasculature , and its oxygen from the atmosphere by tear film , and also by perilimbal capillaries . The layers of the cornea are organised into epithelium , Bowman’s membrane , stroma , Dua’s layer , Descemet membrane , and endothelium ( Jacob 2016 ) ; these layers can be seen in Figure 1 . Figure 1 : Layers of cornea structure : ( a ) Epithelium ( b ) Bowman’s Membreane ( c ) Stroma ( d ) Dua’s layer ( e ) Descemet’s membrane ( f ) Endothelium . Image taken from Mastering Endothelial Keratoplasty ( Jacob 2016 ) . Epithelium 1 . 3 . 1 . The corneal epithelium , along with the tear film , is integral in maintaining a smooth refractive surface , and provides a mechanical barrier to pathogens . It is made up of non - keratinised , stratified , squamous epithelial cells , five to seven layers thick . The outermost layer consists of two to three layers of fully differentiated superficial cells tasked with maintaining tear film stability by secreting glycocalyx . Loss of glycocalyx causes a loss of tear stability , and a breakdown of the ocular optical system ( Delmonte & T . K . Kim 2011 ) . The surface area of superficial cells varies with type of measurement used , where using specular microscopy the mean area has been measured as 628 . 2 ± 13 . 4 µm 2 ( Tsubota et al . 27 1996 ) whereas by confocal microscopy , mean area was measured as 913 ± 326 µm 2 ( Mustonen et al . 1998 ) . The corneal epithelium however changes proportionally to continuous wearing time of extended wear soft contact lenses ( Tsubota et al . 1996 ) . The layer underneath the superficial layer is comprised of wing cells , two to three layers thick , named so due to its morphology . These are less flat than the superficial cell layer , and are in an intermediate state of differentiation . Basal cells , a single layer of columnar epithelium 20µm tall , located beneath the layer of wing cells , are the only cells that have the mitotic ability to differentiate into wing and superficial cells ( Jacob 2016 ; Delmonte & T . K . Kim 2011 ) . The epithelium layers can be seen in Figure 2 . Figure 2 : Illustration of the layers of the corneal epithelium . ( A ) Superficial cells ( B ) Wing cells ( D ) Basal cell . Image taken from Figure taken from Mastering Endothelial Keratoplasty ( Jacob 2016 ) . Epithelial cell turnover 1 . 3 . 2 . It is suggested that equilibrium between mitosis , cellular migration and shedding of epithelial cells is integral in epithelial regeneration . The corneal epithelium regenerates every 7 to 14 days , where daughter cells differentiate into wing cells and migrate to the surface ( Jacob 2016 ) . Bowman’s membrane 1 . 3 . 3 . The Bowman’s membrane is an acellular structure measuring 10µm thick , which lies between the basal corneal epithelium and the anterior stroma . It is composed of predominately collagen types I and III , which are continuous with the anterior stroma and 28 helps maintain the shape of the cornea . It also acts as a barrier to trauma . However , it does not possess the ability to regenerate and it will form a fibrous scar on injury ( Jacob 2016 ) Stroma 1 . 3 . 4 . The stroma constitutes 90 % of the total corneal thickness , and is predominately composed of collagen fibrils types I , III , V and VI ( Jacob 2016 ) . The stroma contains approximately 200 - 250 bundles of collagen fibres , called lamellae ( Delmonte & T . K . Kim 2011 ) . Transparency and biomechanical strength of the stroma relies on the precise organisation of lamellae , and are arranged using uniform and regular spacing ( Jacob 2016 ) . Scattered within the lamellae there are highly metabolically active cells called keratocytes . These cells are integral to maintaining the extracellular matrix environment ( also required for stromal transparency ) ( Delmonte & T . K . Kim 2011 ) by synthesising collagen and proteoglycans of the stroma ( Jacob 2016 ) . Keratocytes also contain a soluble protein called “crystallins” that further contribute to maintaining corneal transparency ( Delmonte & T . K . Kim 2011 ; Jester et al . 1999 ) . Dua’s layer 1 . 3 . 5 . This layer is a tough , well - defined acellular lining between the stroma and the Descemet’s membrane measuring 10 . 15±3 . 6µm thick ( Dua et al . 2013 ) . It is composed of thicker fibrils than those in the stroma , and are composed in 5 – 8 lamellae of predominantly type I collagen that run in longitudinal , transverse , and oblique directions ( Jacob 2016 ; Dua et al . 2013 ) . Its recent discovery will potentially influence corneal surgery where it has been suggested that it can be used to generate tissue for endothelial transplant in the instance of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty ( DALK ) ( Dua et al . 2013 ) . Descemet’s membrane 1 . 3 . 6 . This is a separate layer between the Dua’s layer and the endothelium , and measures approximately 8 - 10µm thick . It primarily comprises of collagen types III and VIII contributing to the elasticity of this layer along with glycoproteins fibronecton , laminin and 29 thrombospondin . This membrane has been deposited by endothelial cells derived from the neural crest ( Tuft & Coster 1990 ; Jacob 2016 ) . The endothelium 1 . 3 . 7 . The corneal endothelium is a monolayer of hexagonal cells ( sometimes described as a “honey - comb like mosaic” ; ( Delmonte & T . K . Kim 2011 ) ) that lines the posterior corneal surface , and is approximately 10µm thick at birth . The cells flatten in adulthood , and thickness reduces to 4µm . Human endothelial cells are arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with no mitotic activity , although the reason for this is unknown . Nevertheless , the endothelium barrier is permeable enough to mediate the osmotic gradient required for the deturgesced state of the stroma . Change in endothelial cell morphology can detrimentally contribute to endothelial cell ability to deturgesce the cornea ( Delmonte & T . K . Kim 2011 ) . 1 . 4 . Ocular dyes Within ocular healthcare Rose Bengal , Lissamine Green B and sodium fluorescein ( fluorescein ; abbreviated to FL throughout thesis ) are three commonly used dye used to detect ocular lesions or diseases . Lissamine Green B is a synthetic organic acid made up of two amino phenyl groups ( Norn , 1973 ) . Rose Bengal is a chemical derivative of fluorescein ( Romanchuk 1982 ) , where fluorescein itself is a xanthene product of resorcinol and pthalic anhydride first demonstrated by von Baeyer in 1871 . Chemical structures of FL , Rose Bengal and Lissamine Green B are shown in Figure 3 . 30 Figure 3 : Molecular structures of Sodium fluorescein ( left ) , Rose Bengal ( centre ) and Lissamine Green B ( right ) ( J . Kim 2000 ) . Rose Bengal 1 . 4 . 1 . Kim describes that the use of Rose Bengal did not become popular within the ophthalmic community until 1933 when a common Rose Bengal staining pattern in keratoconjunctivitis patients was recognised ( J . Kim 2000 ) . Several studies show that Rose Bengal does not stain healthy cells , but dead or degenerated cells ( Norn 1967 ; Norn 1969 ; Norn 1970 ) . Interestingly , the interaction of Rose Bengal and tear proteins have shown certain proteins could bind to and subsequently block Rose Bengal uptake in cell culture , however it is unlikely that the same extent of protein - Rose Bengal binding would occur on the ocular surface ( Tseng & Zhang 1995 ) . Rose Bengal has been used to study dry eye ( as reviewed in Doughty 2013b ) , but has also been used to characterise unstable tear film ( Lee & Tseng 1997 ) , and as an aid in locating cells for impression cytology ( Doughty 2013a ) . Lissamine Green B 1 . 4 . 2 . The Lissamine Green B ( Lissamine Green ) clinical staining profile is similar to that of Rose Bengal demonstrated by ( Norn 1973 ) although it should be noted that Rose Bengal induces more irritation of the ocular surface compared to Lissamine Green ( Khurana et al . 1991 ; Machado et al . 2009 ) . Lissamine Green has been shown to similarly stain dry eye patients comparable to Rose Bengal ( Machado et al . 2009 ) , utilised to stain the bulbar conjunctiva ( Manning et al . 1995 ) and marginal conjunctiva ( Doughty et al . 2004 ) . 31 Both Lissamine Green and Rose Bengal are available as sterile strips impregnated with 1 . 5mg of the compound . However , given Rose Bengal has shown to cause more discomfort more often than any other vital dye , Lissamine Green is the preferred dye to study ocular health ( J . Kim 2000 ; Korb et al . 2008 ) . In fact , the Association of British Dispensing Opticians ( ABDO ) , reports that due to the “discomfort and stinging on insertion " , Lissamine Green has replaced Rose Bengal as the preferred conjunctival stain and Rose Bengal is no longer available in the UK ( McNamee 2012 ) . Sodium fluorescein 1 . 4 . 3 . The molecular formula of fluorescein is C 20 H 10 O 3 Na 2 , with a molecular weight of 376 . 27 g / mol . It is a disodium salt and is available as a red / orange crystalline powder ; nevertheless , at 15°C it has 50 % solubility in water ( Romanchuk 1982 ) . As later discussed , there are many ophthalmic uses for fluorescein but it is not limited to the area . It is applied to a plethora of diverse disciplines such as oceanography to tract currents in and marine biology to determine skin damage in fish ( Hart et al . 2003 ; Livengood et al . 2013 ; Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . 1 . 5 . Fluorescence profile of Fluorescein Fluorescein is a fluorescent molecule . A fluorescent compound has its own excitation and absorption spectra causing each dye to emit fluorescence at a specific wavelength . FL can be excited at 480 - 500nm which then fluoresces green between 500 - 600nm ( Noga & Udomkusonsri 2002 ) . The maximum excitation and emission wavelengths however are reported as 490nm and 530nm ( Romanchuk 1982 ) . Molecular basis of fluorescence emission 1 . 5 . 1 . When fluorescent molecules are exposed to certain wavelength of light , the absorbed light causes fluorphores to enter a higher singlet electronic state ( S 1 or S 2 ) from its ground state ( S 0 ) . As fluorophores return to S 0 , a photon is emitted , which is detected at a longer but 32 lower energy wavelength than its excitation wavelength ; this is observed as fluorescence . Fluorescence is typically illustrated by a Jablonski diagram as shown in Figure 4 . Figure 4 : Jablonski diagram adapted from Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy ( Lakowicz 2013 ) . 1 . 6 . Factors affecting fluorescein fluorescence on the ocular surface Clinically , fluorescein is available as single sterile use solution vials of 1 % or 2 % Minims ( Chauvin Pharmaceutical Ltd by Bausch + Lomb ) or as 1mg sodium fluorescein Fluorets . Upon administering fluorescein to the eye , there are several factors that need to be considered such as concentration , pH , length of exposure and number of applications .

Maximum fluorescence can be achieved at 0 . 001 % w / v concentration of fluorescein , although there are discrepancies in the literature regarding the specific concentration ( Romanchuk 1982 ; Nichols et al . 2012 ) . Fluorescein concentration however demonstrates a non - linear relationship with fluorescence , which is typically taken into consideration in clinical practice ( Romanchuk 1982 ; Ossewaarde - Van Norel et al . 2002 ; Shotton & Habeeb 1955 ; Tan et al . 2013 ) . Fluorescein nevertheless exhibits self - or concentration quenching , where quenching occurs above concentrations that induce the maximum fluorescence ( Romanchuk 1982 ) . The process of quenching is a reversible loss of fluorescence , and is a Internal S 0 S 1 S 2 Fluorescence Absorption Absorption 33 unique property of fluorescent compounds ( Lichtman & Conchello 2005 ) . There are several possible mechanisms by which quenching can occur such as Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer ( FRET ) , or contact quenching ; these mechanisms of quenching have been used in the development of oligonucleotides and peptides probes , and of molecular beacons to target specific nucleic acids and peptides ( Marras et al . 2002 ; Johansson & Cook 2003 ; Crisalli & Kool 2011 ; Marras 2006 ) . Other mechanisms of quenching include collisional quenching ( Eftink & Ghiron 1976 ) , and charge transfer quenching ( Föll et al . 1990 ) . Fluorescein in high concentrations will appear yellow whilst in more dilute concentrations it will appear green . This is because at higher concentrations , the maximum emission spectrum is shifted towards a longer wavelength ( Romanchuk 1982 ) . Fluorescein fluorescence intensity can also be reduced by simple absorbance - based quenching , demonstrated by Rose Bengal as the quencher in a study by Doughty ( Doughty 2014 ) . There is little information in the literature regarding the concentration of fluorescein on the ocular surface . Peterson and colleagues have tested four different fluorescein instillation methods : 1 % Minim , 2 % Minim , a single drop of saline on a fluoret , and fluoret moistened with saline with the excess shaken off ( Peterson et al . 2006 ) . Quenching was observed with all fluorescein instillation methods , however levels of “useful fluorescence” were achieved by 1 % minim and the moistened fluoret quicker than 2 % minim and the fluoret moistened with a single drop of saline only . Although it was identified that fluorescein application with 1 % Minim achieved the greatest intensity , the specific concentration of fluorescein available on the ocular surface at the time of viewing was not quantified ( Peterson et al . 2006 ) . However in a different study by Glasgow , after 22mM fluorescein application and fluorescein intensity measurement in corneal cells removed by cytology , fluorescein was seen to quench from 1 to 16 minutes after instillation of fluorescein . This was observed despite fluorescein concentration having decreased below the quenching threshold in the 34 tear film ( Glasgow 2016 ) . Further study of fluorescein concentration on the ocular surface is required to understand the physiochemical properties of fluorescein at the time of clinical observation . pH 1 . 6 . 2 . Fluorescein absorption and emissions spectra are affected by the pH of its environment ( Romanchuk 1982 ) . At an acidic pH , fluorescein will fluoresce a blue / green whereas at an alkali pH , it will fluoresce yellow ( Romanchuk 1982 ) . It has been reported that fluorescence intensity increases with pH of solution where on reaching pH 8 , it will start to decrease , whilst others reported this at pH 6 ( Shotton & Habeeb 1955 ) . Between pH 7 and 8 , an effect on its absorption or emission spectra is not detected ( Romanchuk 1982 ) . On the ocular surface , fluorescein is subjected to the ocular surface tear fluid . The average pH on the ocular surface tear fluids in normals vary across studies ( pH 6 . 93 ± 0 . 24 as reported by ( Norn 1988 ) , and pH 7 . 83 ± 0 . 1 as reported by ( Chen & Maurice 1990 ) , and also over the course of the day ( Coles & Jaros 1984 ) ) . However , it does not exhibit the acidic or slightly alkali conditions that have been reported to cause significant changed in fluorescein absorption or emission spectra . Length of exposure to Fluorescein 1 . 6 . 3 . Due to its quenching properties , fluorescein fluorescence intensity is likely dependent on the time of observation of the ocular surface after application . However , the duration of time the ocular surface is exposed to fluorescein also has an effect on the intensity seen . The study by Hickey and colleagues investigated this aspect by exposing the eyes of rabbits to 100µl of 2 % fluorescein for various lengths of time : 15 seconds , 30 seconds , 1 minute and 4 minutes ( Hickey et al . 1973 ) . On causing injury to the cornea , maximum fluorescein intensity had been reached after 15 seconds of fluorescein exposure . Moreover , on measuring intensity after 48 hours , by which point full recovery from injury had been achieved , fluorescence was lost only for those stained for 15 seconds . This suggests that 15 35 seconds of exposure is a sufficient length of time to detect injury as well as minimise staining of healthy corneal epithelium . Number and layering of fluorescein application 1 . 6 . 4 . The intensity of fluorescence seen on the ocular surface is also affected by the number of times fluorescein is applied ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . The process of sequential fluorescein instillations has been investigated in six subjects who exhibited staining in preliminary experiments ( stainers ) and one control subject who exhibited no staining in preliminary experiments ( non - stainers ) ( Josephson & Caffery 1992 ) . A solution of 2 % fluorescein was sequentially applied 7 times over a 28 - minute period in all seven subjects , and examined by one examiner using a cobalt blue filter and number 12 Wratten yellow enhancement filter . This process was repeated every 2 hours over a total of 12 hours . All stainers exhibited staining at all time - points , with increased incidence of staining observed at the first of the instillations ( at 0800am ) , although the amount and area of staining differed . Some subjects who did show sequential staining , also underwent overnight patching of the eye , which did not influence the incidence of staining in these corneas ( Josephson & Caffery 1992 ) . However , the mechanism for this increase in corneal staining is not understood ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . Furthermore , the ‘thickness’ of the dye also causes variation in staining seen . In this sense , the term ‘thickness’ refers to the amount of dye that layers on top of the eye . This factor is affected by the composition and quantity of tear fluid ( Eliason & Maurice 1990 ) . Morgan and colleagues give an example of this where exaggerated blinking can rectify the initial lack of fluorescence in a patient as this causes the dye to dissipate and overcome the quenching effect ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . The most common ophthalmic uses of fluorescein are discussed below . 36 1 . 7 . Ophthalmic application of Fluorescein Pfluger in 1882 demonstrated breaks in corneal epithelium by use of sodium fluorescein , and this saw its introduction into the ophthalmic community ( J . Kim 2000 ) . Now , due to its spectral and synthetic chemistry properties , it is one of the most utilised fluorescent dyes in scientific research ( Lavis et al . 2007 ) . TBUT 1 . 7 . 1 . Fluorescein is frequently used to confirm symptomatic dry eye by analysis of the tear break up time ( TBUT ) . It is used as a measurement of tear stability but is not a reflection of aqueous quantity in tears ( Murube 2003 ) . The classic method of assessing TBUT is to apply sodium fluorescein into the eye and to analyse the break up pattern using a slit - lamp ( Pult & Riede - Pult 2012 ) . The Schirmer’s test ( ST ) designed by Otto Schirmer in 1903 is another method of diagnosing dry eye , which further allows the quantification of lacrimal secretion ( Murube 2003 ) . Although ST does have poor sensitivity in detecting dry eye condition , this can be overcome by analysis of fluorescein meniscus time ( FMT ) instead . FMT is a measurement of the rate of tear meniscus formation ( Kallarackal et al . 2002 ) . It was concluded that FMT is a more sensitive method for assessing tear production in comparison to ST ( Kallarackal et al . 2002 ) . It is interesting to note that TBUT , nonetheless , is the most sensitive method in detecting the stability of lacriminal tears ( Kallarackal et al . 2002 ) . Retinal and iris angiography 1 . 7 . 2 . In addition , fluorescein is used in iris angiography as a means of exposing ocular pathologies such as glaucoma , retinal vascular occlusions and tumour , a few examples amongst many ( Brancato et al . 1997 ) . This also indirectly but confidently allows analysis of retinal circulation ( Brancato et al . 1997 ; Rechtman et al . 2009 ) . Retinal ( fundus ) angiography is also a major use of fluorescein , which is used to assess vascular flow of the retinal vessels in diabetes ( Sakata et al . 2007 ) and in some forms of age - related maculopathy ( Rosenfeld et al . 2006 ; Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . 37 Epithelial permeability 1 . 7 . 3 . Moreover , as a research tool , fluorescein is used to assess epithelial permeability that may occur as a result of soft contact lens wear ( McNamara et al . 1998 ) and use of toxic drugs and preservatives ( Joshi et al . 1996 ) . It is found that any subsequent trauma is highlighted by the uptake of fluorescein that occurs as a consequence of an increase in cell permeability ( Joshi et al . 1996 ) . As such , epithelial barrier function is relative to permeability of the corneal epithelium to fluorescein ( P dc ) ( McNamara et al . 1998 ) . 1 . 8 . Corneal staining with Fluorescein Practice dictates fluorescein is most commonly used as a stain to assess corneal integrity ( K . W . Ward 2008 ) . The term ‘staining’ refers to the hyperfluorescence observed on application of fluorescein and subsequent illumination with cobalt blue light ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . Ocular staining is commonly associated with corneal epithelial defects ( Maldonado - Codina et al . 2013 ; Tabery 1992 ) , such as with ocular disease ( Jie et al . 2008 ; McMonnies 2007 ) , following trauma ( for example alkali burns or corneal abrasions ) ( Wipperman & Dorsch 2013 ; Fante & Trobe 2014 ; S . A . Wilson & Last 2004 ; Smally et al . 1992 ; Scarlett & Gee 2007 ) and with certain MPS and contact lens wear combinations ( Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ; Carnt , Willcox , et al . 2007 ) . Corneal staining observed in non - contact lens wearers is typically referred to as ‘background staining’ : of 102 non - contact lens wearers examined , 79 % of corneas exhibited some form of staining when using the CCLRU photographic grading scale ( discussed in more detail in Section 1 . 8 . 1 ) in a study by Dundas and colleagues ( Dundas et al . 2001 ) . In another study , it was similarly seen that the median staining grade of 16 non - contact lens wearers was 0 . 5 using a 0 to 4 grading scale ( Schwallie et al . 1997 ) . Observation of fluorescein of the ocular surface is typically performed using a standard white - bulb slit - lamp biomicroscope . A blue filter is used to minimise the wavelength of spectral radiation from the white bulb to better match fluorescein excitation wavelengths , 38 and an additional barrier filter ( yellow ) is used to optimise viewing fluorescein fluorescence at 510 - 520nm . An example of ocular surface staining with and without a yellow filter can be seen in Figure 5 ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . Figure 5 : Corneal surface observed using a slit lamp biomicroscope without ( A ) and with ( B ) a yellow barrier filter ; adapted from Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 . Grading systems 1 . 8 . 1 . Corneal surface fluorescence ( CSF ) is classified according to several parameters that include shape , intensity and location of fluorescence ; a summary of which can be found in Table 1 . A B 39 Table 1 : Classification of CSF with key descriptors ; adapted from Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 . Grading systems have been developed for CSF to classify its severity specifically for contact lens wearers ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . Staining can be assigned according to the Efron scale , which consists of single values : the increase from 0 to 4 represents an increase in severity ( Efron 1998 ) . This can be seen in Table 2 . Table 2 : Efron grading scale , adapted from Efron 1998 . The type , extent and depth of staining can also be scored according to the Cornea and Contact Lens Research Unit ( CCLRU ) grading system . Again , each variable is assigned a grade from 0 to 4 depending on severity ( Table 3 ) . This scale has been used to determine staining amongst healthy individuals so as to differentiate from pathological corneal Mucin balls Dimple veil SICS Foreign body Smile Superior epithelial 3 & 9 Intensity Coalescent Coalescent Punctate or diffuse Coalescent Calescent or diffuse Coalescent Punctate or diffuse Shape Circular Circular Annular or circular Linear Arcuate or band Arcuate Patch Location Any corneal area Commonly central or mid - peripheral All corneal areas , sometimes with central sparing Any corneal area Inferior Superior Nasal and / or diffuse Grade Definition Interpretation 0 Normal No tissue changes 1 Trace Clinical action not required 2 Mild Clinical action may be required 3 Moderate Clinical action usually required 4 Severe Clinical action urgently required 40 staining ( Dundas et al . 2001 ) . It was found that 79 % of the corneas tested showed some degree of staining ( Dundas et al . 2001 ) . Table 3 : CCLRU grading scale , adapted from Jalbert et al . 1999 . 1 . 9 . Solution induced corneal staining ( SICS ) The term ‘stain’ or ‘staining’ refers to the ocular surface fluorescence seen , and again this is commonly associated with corneal epithelial defects ( Maldonado - Codina et al . 2013 ; Tabery 1992 ) . SICS however is described as a discrete , superficial punctate staining of the corneal epithelium ( L . W . Jones & D . A . Jones 2001 ) . One of the first cases of solution induced corneal staining ( SICS ) demonstrated was in 2002 by Jones and his team . They found superficial punctate staining with the use of polyaminopropyl / polyhexamethylene biguanide ( PHMB ) preserved solution ReNu Multiplus® ( Bausch + Lomb ) in Pure Vision ( balafilcon A ) contact lenses ( Bausch + Lomb ) ( L . Jones et al . 2002 ) . Staining can take on an annular pattern where it concentrates in the peripheral cornea , or it can spread evenly across the cornea ( Fonn 2010 ) . Such staining is readily observed on application of soft contact lenses that have been stored in certain MPS ( Bandamwar et al . 2010 ; Garofalo et al . 2005 ) . A number of clinical studies have been performed to document the effects of Grade Type Extent Depth 0 Absent Absent Absent 1 Micropunctate 1 - 15 % surface involvement Superficial epithelial involvement 2 Macropunctate 16 - 30 % surface involvement Stromal glow present within 30seconds 3 Coalescent macropunctate 31 - 45 % surface involvement Immediate localised stromal glow 4 Coalescent patch 1mm or greater in size 46 % or greater surface Immediate diffuse stromal glow 41 various contact lens solutions and contact lens materials on fluorescein fluorescence as discussed below . Since 2002 , many studies have been conducted exhibiting the SICS phenomenon ( Garofalo et al . 2005 ; Bandamwar et al . 2010 ; Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ) . Some of these studies were extensive such as the IER Matrix Study ( Carnt , Willcox , et al . 2007 ) and the Andrasko Staining Grid ( Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ) . Corneal Staining Grid 1 . 9 . 1 . Andrasko and colleagues have documented the effects of SICS in the presence of various MPS and contact lens material combinations ( Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ) in the Andrasko Staining Grid ( accessible at www . staininggrid . com ) . This staining grid is regularly updated , and as of July 2017 the most recent staining grid can be seen in Figure 6 . Contact lenses were pre - soaked in the test MPS overnight and were then inserted into subjects for 2 hours of wear . For corneal staining assessment , sodium fluorescein ( 0 . 6mg FUL - GLO ophthalmic strip ) was instilled into each eye and examined using a cobalt filter and a yellow Wratten number 12 filter . Corneal staining was then graded in 5 corneal regions : central , superior , inferior , nasal and temporal . This was then averaged to assign a staining area percentage to each eye . To determine an overall average staining area percentage for each MPS and lens combination , the eye with the maximum staining area for each subject was then averaged with the worst eye of all other subjects . The Andrasko Corneal Staining Grid is uniquely colour coded , where each colour represents the severity of staining observed . For instance , green represents insignificant staining of less than 10 % of the cornea , yellow represents 10 - 20 % staining and staining of above 20 % is represented as the colour red . Widespread staining suggests a change in contact lens care should be considered . As seen in Figure 6 , PHMB - based MPS such as Biotrue® , ReNu Fresh® and ReNu Sensitive Multi - purpose solution® cause the most 42 staining in both Hydrogel and Silicone - Hydrogel contact lenses . For example , staining was observed in as large as 73 % of the corneal surface with MPS ReNu Fresh® and Purevision Hydrogels . In contrast , Polyquad / Aldox solutions ( for example Opti - Free Replenish® and Opti - Free Express® ) cause insignificant staining in all contact lens materials tested , where the maximum area of staining of 7 % was observed . However , it must be acknowledged that the data represents only 2 hours of lens wear , and the results of this study may not be indicative of long - term MPS / lens wear . Figure 6 : The Andrasko Corneal Staining Grid accessed 11 July 2017 ( www . staininggrid . com ) . Dillehay and colleagues however question the statistical and clinical relevance of the methodology and data analysis used in the work by Andrasko ( Dillehay et al . 2007 ) . The statistical work performed by Dillehay in 2007 indicate that the colour coded version of the staining grid should be interpreted with caution , as their statistical analysis consistently demonstrated higher corneal staining for only ReNu Fresh® ( previously known as ReNu Branded Solutions Private Label Solutions Unisol 1 4 Saline Clear Care 4 OPTI - FREE ® EXPRESS 1 OPTI - FREE ® RepleniSH 1 OPTI - FREE ® PureMoist 1 Biotrue 3 Renu Fresh 3 Renu Sensitive 3 Complete MPS 2 Aquify 4 Walmart MPS ( Renu M + ) Target MPS ( Renu M + ) CVS MPS ( Renu M + ) Walgreen MPS ( Renu M + ) Acuvue 5 2 1 % 1 % 2 % 5 % 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % Proclear 6 1 % 1 % 1 % 2 % 1 % 28 % 57 % 23 % 6 % 12 % 61 % 54 % 53 % 42 % Soﬂens 3 66 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % 52 % 73 % 32 % 17 % 8 % 66 % 62 % 63 % 56 % Acuvue Advance 5 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % 9 % 13 % 4 % 12 % 2 % 16 % 13 % 12 % 12 % Acuvue Oasys 5 2 % 1 % 3 % 5 % 2 % 1 % 9 % 5 % 4 % 3 % 12 % 8 % 13 % 10 % Bioﬁnity 6 2 % 2 % 3 % 2 % 1 % 17 % 4 % 2 % 2 % 2 % 4 % 3 % 3 % 2 % Purevision 3 2 % 1 % 4 % 7 % 3 % 46 % 73 % 43 % 15 % 21 % 71 % 76 % No Testing Planned No Testing Planned O2 Optix 4 2 % 1 % 2 % 5 % 1 % 21 % 24 % 7 % 3 % 3 % 41 % 28 % 28 % 24 % Night & Day 4 2 % 1 % 2 % 3 % 1 % 17 % 24 % 11 % 1 % 3 % 36 % 24 % 26 % 22 % Updated : August 19 , 2011 H 2 O 2 POLYQUAD / ALDOX PHMB / Polyquaternium BIGUANIDES ( PHMB ) H y d r og e l S ili c on e - H y d r og e l s Trademarks : 1 Alcon ; 2 AMO ; 3 Bausch & Lomb ; 4 Novartis ; 5 Johnson & Johnson ; 6 CooperVision Staining Zone Color Codes under 10 % 10 % to 20 % over 20 % Andrasko Staining Grid Percentage of Average Corneal Staining Area at 2 Hours Data Courtesy of : www .

Figure 7 : “Statistically - based Corneal Staining Grid Analysis of the Dataset of Andrasko and Ryen” Data Accessed May 27 , 2007 from www . staininggrid . com , taken from Dillehay et al . 2007 . The Institute for Eye Research ( IER ) matrix study 1 . 9 . 2 . The IER matrix study , conducted in 2007 , followed groups of 40 subjects for 3 months of lens wear . Each group was tested a combination of MPS and silicone hydrogel lens , where 16 different combinations were tested . Corneal staining was then graded from 0 to 4 in the central , superior , inferior , nasal and temporal zones of the cornea at baseline , two weeks , one month and finally at three months : 0 signifies no staining , 1 = ≤ 5 % , 2 = 6 to 10 % , 3 = 16 - 30 % and 4 = > 30 % . The results of this work are shown in Figure 8 . Each percentage is representative of patients who exhibited SICS per month . 44 Direct comparisons between the Andrasko Corneal Staining Grid and The IER Matrix study cannot be made as the area of staining in the Andrasko Corneal Staining grid is assessed after only 2 hours of lens wear . Nevertheless , long - term use of Opti - Free Express® and Opti - Free Replenish® was seen to cause a greater SICS response in combination with Acuvue® Oasys™ , O 2 Optix™ , and PureVision® lenses , in contrast to short - term wear of 2 hours . That is , the combination of Polyquad / Aldox based MPS was seen to induce more corneal staining with a larger range of silicone hydrogel lenses than PHMB - based AQuify® MPS . Figure 8 : IER Matrix Study data ; percent of patients per month ( taken from Carnt et al . 2007 ) . 1 . 10 . Multi purpose solutions ( MPS ) composition Different MPS will cause varying levels of staining , suggesting that the various components of MPS may be responsible for this . Components of MPS include preservatives , buffers , surfactants and chelating or wetting agents ( Sorbara et al . 2009 ) . Future work , however , could benefit from a thorough analysis of different combinations of MPS components and their effect on staining . 45 Preservatives 1 . 10 . 1 . To avoid adverse effects ( Alfonso et al . 2006 ; Joslin et al . 2007 ) , MPS contain preservatives such as polyquaternium - 1 ( PQ - 1 ) , polyaminopropyl / polyhexamethylene biguanide ( PHMB ) ( Sorbara et al . 2009 ) or benzalkonium chloride ( BAK ) ( Richardson et al . 1977 ) . Not only do preservatives provide antimicrobial activity in the bottle , but they also deter decomposition of active compounds in solution ( Noecker 2001 ) . The afore - mentioned preservative based MPS are more commonly used over hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) based solutions due to convenience and low costs ( Woods et al . 2007 ) . H 2 O 2 is not any less an effective antimicrobial agent when compared to PQ - 1 or PHMB , and as it is utilised in lieu of lens - solution incompatibilities , it still plays an important role in lens care ( Papas et al . 2007 ) . There are two methods of neutralising H 2 O 2 giving rise to one - step and two - step systems . The one - step neutralisation system is achieved by either catalytic platinum , or by the release of catalase in form of a tablet , both of which can be located within the contact lens storage case ( Hiti et al . 2005 ) . Two - step systems require soaking in a second catalytic solution 10 minutes prior to lens wear . Each system has been tested for its antimicrobial activity , and it was found that a one - step system undergoes neutralisation too rapidly and as such , a two - step system for storage and disinfection ( against Acanthamoeba specifically ) has been recommended ( Hiti et al . 2005 ) . Biguanides have been recognised as potent antimicrobial agents from as early as 1946 by Curd and Rose , and as such has given rise to polymeric hexamythelene biguanides such as PHMB . It has been found that as polymer length increases , so does its microbial activity ( Broxton et al . 1983 ) . PHMB binds to the bacterial envelope and displaces the otherwise stabilizing Ca 2 + , which leads to a loss of transport , biosynthetic and catabolic capability ( Gilbert & Moore 2005 ) . Also possessing antimicrobial activity is Polyquaternium - 1 . It is a 46 quaternary ammonium compound that causes perturbation of bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and of the outer - membrane in Gram - negative bacteria ( Gilbert & Moore 2005 ; Codling et al . 2003 ) . It has been reported that by simply excluding the preservative component in MPS , or switching to use of a MPS with a different preservative , can alleviate symptoms of SICS ( L . W . Jones & D . A . Jones 2001 ) . This suggests that it could play an integral role in explaining the mechanism of SICS . Surface - active agents ( Surfactants ) 1 . 10 . 2 . Cleansing the lens before disinfection is highly recommended by practitioners ( Christie & Meyler 1997 ) . For use in hydrogel lenses , there are two main types of cleaners . Enzymatic cleaners cause breakdown and subsequent removal of proteins , where surfactant ( daily ) cleaners remove and cleanse lenses of lipids and mucus ( Christie & Meyler 1997 ) . Surfactants are also traditionally used as wetting agents with the expectation that they are adsorbed on the lens and are subsequently increasing the wettability of the lens surface ( Lin & Svitova 2010 ) . Surfactant molecules , which possess polar and non - polar components , form micelles in aqueous solutions at concentrations above what is called the critical micelle concentration ( CMC ) ( Cui et al . 2008 ) . Micelles typically from spherical complexes with a dry non - polar hydrophobic core and a polar hydrophilic exterior ( Long et al . 2015 ) . Despite lens care systems being divided into surfactant cleaners , single - purpose disinfecting solutions or multi - purpose solutions , it was seen that all solutions that contain surface - active ingredients are the most effective in protein / spoliation removal ( Franklin 1997 ) . The efficacy of cleaning ability of a lens care solution however does vary with surfactant . Typical examples of surfactants are poloxamers such as Pluronic® , and poloxamines such as Tetronic® , both of which are block copolymers constituted by 47 poly ( ethylene oxide ) and poly ( propylene oxide ) ( PEO and PPO respectively ) . Block co - polymers typically exhibit increased ability to form micelle - like structures in comparison to common surfactants ( Sandez - Macho et al . 2015 ) . Examples of these surfactants can be seen in Figure 9 and Figure 10 where in contrast to Tetronics® , Pluronics® are linear in shape . The effect of the cleaning capabilities of MPS containing Pluronic® and Tetronic® surfactants investigated in an in vitro model was seen to increase with surfactant molecular weight : Tetronic® 1304 > 904 , and Pluronic® 127 > 87 ( Franklin et al . 2013 ) . Figure 9 : Structure of poloxamer Pluronic® F127 ( Ivanova et al . 2000 ) Figure 10 : Structure of poloxamine Tetronic® 1107 ( Flor et al . 2010 ) Chelating agents 1 . 10 . 3 . The most commonly used chelating agent in MPS is ethylene diamine tetra - acetic acid ( EDTA ) . EDTA is a chelating agent that sequesters metals such as calcium to act synergistically with the preservatives in MPS , enhancing antimicrobial activity of lens care solutions ( Christie & Meyler 1997 ; Bartlett 2013 ) . 1 . 11 . SICS and toxicity The word ‘toxic’ is used rather liberally to describe the corneal staining fluorescence associated with MPS and is sometimes used in spite of a lack of damage to the cornea . Even though the data regarding the aetiology behind SICS is inconclusive and requires 48 clarifying , there are some studies that have been able to identify products that are responsible for SICS using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) ( Tchao et al . 2002 ) . Begley et al . ( 1994a ) investigated possible toxicity of two different MPS , a PHMB - based solution ( ReNu® Multi - purpose solution ) and a one - step a H 2 O 2 system ( AOsept® ) , in 85 hydrogel contact lens wearers ( Begley et al . 1994a ) . It was found that generally ReNu® caused more staining that AOsept® . Nevertheless , as staining was not severe enough to stop contact lens wear , Begley et al . were hesitant to assign any significance of the staining found to successful hydrogen lens wear . Furthermore , testing on rabbit corneas was undertaken with lenses soaked in either a polyquaternium - based solution ( Optifree Express® ) , ReNu® Multi - purpose solution ( PHMB - based ) , AOsept® or saline as a control . Again , ReNu® Multi - purpose solution showed the most effect on the corneal tissue and this was identified by use of SEM ( Begley et al . 1994b ) . Nevertheless , there is much ambiguity surrounding the issue . For example , the studies discussed are demonstrating the elevated toxicity of PHMB based solution in comparison to others . However , in vitro studies show polyquaternium - 1 based solutions are more cytotoxic ( McCanna et al . 2008 ; Wright & Mowrey - McKee 2005 ) . As stated by Lim et al . ( 2009 ) , caution should be used when predicting clinical responses from data gathered in vitro ( Lim et al . 2009 ) . Care should also be taken when comparing data from various studies . They highlight that even if the same MPS are tested across the studies of interest , cytotoxicity measurements will vary if different cell lines and tests / assays / methods are used ( Lim et al . 2009 ) . One study has shown that SICS that can typically be seen with fluorescein , Rose Bengal and Lissamine Green , can also be visualised without ( Maldonado - Codina et al . 2013 ) . The punctate staining seen is reported to be the same size as an individual epithelial cell . This 49 suggests that the localised areas of fluorescence are in fact individual cells ( Maldonado - Codina et al . 2013 ) . The particular phenomenon of SICS needs to be investigated much more thoroughly , extending the studies to include the several other components that are also present in MPS . 1 . 12 . Mechanisms of cellular fluorescence Surface pooling 1 . 12 . 1 . Surface pooling occurs where fluorescein accumulates within depressions of the corneal epithelium ; the formation of ‘mucin balls’ is an example of this ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ; Pritchard et al . 2000 ; Millar et al . 2003 ) . Little is known regarding the composition of these spherical bodies but they are currently described as a unique form of tear debris ( Pritchard et al . 2000 ) . They are typically 50µm in size and as they reside between the back surface of a hydrogel contact lens and the corneal epithelium , they are immobilized here ( Millar et al . 2003 ) . On removal of the contact lens and subsequent application of fluorescein , the dye is said to pool within the depression caused by the mucin balls ( Szczotka - Flynn et al . 2011 ) . It has also been suggested that the mechanism of surface pooling can be attributed to the ‘dimple veil’ effect that occurs in rigid lens wearers ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . The trapping of air bubbles cause indentations on the corneal surface and causes pooling of the dye ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ; Szczotka - Flynn et al . 2011 ) . However , surface pooling does not account for the punctate staining found in non - contact lens wearers as stated by Jones and Jones ( L . W . Jones & D . A . Jones 2001 ) . Furthermore , excessive blinking or irrigation does not remove the punctate stain and therefore surface pooling over irregularities such as indentations is unlikely ( Mokhtarzadeh et al . 2011 ; G . Wilson et al . 1995 ; Bandamwar et al . 2012 ) . 50 Uptake by dead cells 1 . 12 . 2 . Conventionally , fluorescein was thought to enter a cell when membrane integrity was comprised through lysis . Thus , this theory dictated that only damaged cells would be stained . However , in contrast to these previous beliefs , fluorescein does in fact stain healthy cells in addition to damaged cells ( J . Kim 2000 ; Hickey et al . 1973 ) . It has been suggested that staining of a seemingly healthy cell may not be indicative of an adverse reaction , but may actually be a part of normal cell growth . This is suggested because cells undergo desquamation , and through mitotic or apoptotic processes are regenerated ( Brautaset et al . 2008 ) . Further explanations include the movement of fluorescein from a damaged cell to healthy cells through transmembrane tight junctions ( Romanchuk 1982 ) . Loss of cell junction integrity 1 . 12 . 3 . Tight junctions form a continuous intercellular barrier between epithelial cells and separate tissue spaces , and so selectively regulate the movement of solutes across the epithelium ( J . M . Anderson & Van Itallie 2009 ) . The tight junctions themselves are made up of a protein complex of transmembrane and cytoplasmic proteins ( Hartsock & Nelson 2008 ) , and this forms a high resistance barrier ( Cavet et al . 2012 ) . Impact of MPS on this barrier function can be determined by analysing the expression of the tight junction proteins mentioned ( Cavet et al . 2012 ) . Damage to , or loss of , cell junction integrity is thought to enable fluorescein to permeate the corneal epithelium ( Feenstra & Tseng 1992 ) . This phenomenon is also known as the ingress model . 1 . 13 . New theories of fluorescein staining Active transport as a mechanism of fluorescein staining 1 . 13 . 1 . In presence of MPS ReNu Multiplus® , recent research suggests that fluorescein staining is seen in metabolically active , viable cells only ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . Fluorescence microscopy and high content analysis showed fluorescein stained cells rarely also stained with propidium iodide , a necrosis marker . This phenomenon was observed in murine 51 fibroblasts , epithelial ( Vero ) and telomerase - immortalised human corneal epithelial ( hTCEpi ) cells . This in support of further findings that fluorescein staining is actually an active process . That is , fluorescein uptake into cells required active and viable cells . Active transport , by definition , is an ATP requiring process . ATP is mainly generated from glucose catabolised using three pathways : glycolysis , tricarboxylic acid ( TCA or Krebbs ) cycle , and oxidative phosphorylation with the latter process generating large amounts of ATP by ATP synthase ( Bonora et al . 2012 ) . Briefly , murine fibroblasts were incubated with ReNu Multiplus® and fluorescein at 37°C , and were subsequently washed and observed at 4°C ( a temperature where active transport is suppressed ) , to show no change in the proportion of hyperfluorescent cells for up to 100 minutes . This was however in contrast to cells washed and observed at 37°C , where a significant decline in hyperfluorescence was seen . Similarly , temperature was also seen to affect fluorescein entry into cells where only 3 . 1±0 . 8 % of MPS - treated exhibited hyperfluorescence when treated with fluorescein at 4°C compared to 54 . 9±7 . 0 % at 37°C ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . These findings are additionally in support of a number of studies that show fluorescein localises within the cells using confocal microscopy ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ; Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) , and impression cytology ( Mokhtarzadeh et al . 2011 ) . Preservative associated transient hyperfluorescence ( PATH ) hypothesis 1 . 13 . 2 . Preservative associated transient hyperfluorescence ( PATH ) is a radically alternative hypothesis proposed for SICS , and is said to provide an explanation for the MPS related transient corneal hyperfluorescence observed ( Bright et al . 2012 ) . A liposome - based model of the corneal epithelial surface was used to investigate the interaction of preservatives ( PHMB and PQ - 1 ) , fluorescein and cellular membrane components . It was shown that free fluorescein molecules ( FL 2 - ) did not associate with liposomes in contrast to fluorescein - tagged PHMB and PQ - 1 . Significantly , free fluorescein associated with liposomes in the presence of PHMB . Clinically , it is thus suggested that PHMB associates to the human 52 corneal epithelial surface anionic / zwitterionic sites , which then mediates a temporary association of FL 2 - molecules . It is this association of fluorescein to the corneal epithelium that is then observed as hyperfluorescence . It was additionally suggested that PQ - 1 may also mediate fluorescein to the corneal epithelium surface , however due to the disruption caused to membrane integrity by PQ - 1 and the weak association of FL 2 - to PQ - 1 , fluorescence signal may not be clinically visible ( Bright et al . 2012 ) . Hyperfluorescence in apoptotic cells 1 . 13 . 3 . Recent research also indicates hyperfluorescent cells may be apoptotic ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) . Apoptosis is also known as programmed cell death , which allows the organism to control cell number and tissue size ( Hengartner 2000 ) . Live , dead and apoptotic corneal epithelial cells were identified after treatment with various stress stimuli ( preservative , hypertonicity , hypotonicity , scratch and alkaline wounding ) and fluorescein ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) . A greater level of fluorescein fluorescence was seen in apoptotic cells across all treatments , including control ( PBS ) treated cells whereas necrotic cells exhibited low levels of fluorescence . This work suggests clinical hyperfluorescence is representative of apoptotic but still viable cells , and that fluorescein can be used as a probe for apoptotic epithelial cells . This work was conducted using Hoechst 33342 , PI and Annexin - V to stain for individual cells , necrotic cells and apoptotic cells respectively . Briefly , Annexin V is a marker for phosphatidylserine ( PS ) ; PS is translocated from the inner plasma membrane to the cell surface early - on in the execution phase of apoptosis ( Boersma et al , 2005 ) . The localisation and presence of the fluorescence of stained cells observed by fluorescence microscopy was then used to identify the physiological status of each cell . However , as the Annexin - V used was conjugated to a red fluorophore , this may have interfered with any red fluorescence exhibited by PI , causing difficulties in measuring genuine apoptosis ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) . 53 In this thesis however , the association between hyperfluorescence and apoptosis was investigated using the downstream protease of the apoptosis pathway : cleaved ( thus activated ) Caspase - 3 . Caspase - 3 , also known as an executioner or effector caspase , exists as a procaspase dimer when inactive , which prevents accidental activation of the apoptosis pathway . Executioner caspases ( such as caspase - 3 , - 6 , and - 7 ) are activated when the large and small subunits of the procaspase dimer are cleaved , bringing the active sites together to produce a functional protease . This activation is performed by initiator caspases , ( such as caspase - 2 , - 8 , - 9 and - 10 in mammals ) and are activated by dimerization induced by upstream signalling events . Once a single executioner caspase has been activated , it can go on to cleave and activate further executioner caspases , forming a feedback loop for the apoptosis pathway ( Riedl & Shi 2004 ; J . Li & Yuan 2008 ; McIlwain et al . 2013 ) . 1 . 14 . Mechanisms of extracellular uptake In this thesis , active uptake of fluorescein was investigated . Phagocytosis , endocytosis and macropinocytosis are a few of the mechanisms that mediate the uptake of extracellular material into the cell . Phagocytosis is specifically the uptake of large particles , typically > 0 . 5µm . In Metazoa , phagocytosis is primarily utilised by specialised phagocytic cells such as macrophages and neutrophils , for the uptake and degradation of infectious components contributing to the immune response . In lower organisms , phagocytosis is used to acquire nutrients ( Martinet et al . 2009 ) . Endocytosis however is the uptake of proteins , lipids , extracellular ligands and soluble molecules in endocytic vesicles . Endocytosis can be categorised into clathrin - dependent , caveolin - dependent and clathrin / caveolin - independent mechanisms ( Doherty & McMahon 2009 ) . The various mechanisms and pathways of endocytosis are shown in Figure 11 . Endocytosis and macropinocytosis are discussed in further detail below . 54 Figure 11 : Mechanisms of endocytosis ( Mayor & Pagano 2007 ) Clathrin - dependent endocytosis 1 . 14 . 1 . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is the uptake of materials using lattice - like clathrin coated vesicles , and is utilised by all known eukaryotic cells . The clathrin protein , once recruited to the sites of vesicle budding and after vesicle formation , is recycled back into the cytoplasm for reuse in the next cycle of clathrin - mediated uptake . This form of endocytosis regulates surface expression of proteins , samples the cell’s environment for growth and guidance cues , brings nutrients into cells , controls the activation of signalling pathways , retrieves proteins deposited after vesicle fusion , and turns over membrane components by sending components for degradation in lysosomes ( McMahon & Boucrot 2011 ) . For inhibition of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , targeting specific interaction domains of nucleation and clathrin - pit formation are advised . Potassium depletion , monodansylcadaverine ( MDC ) , phenylarside oxide ( PAO ) , cytosolic acidification , hypertonic shock using sucrose , and chlorpromazine have also been used as clathrin - mediated endocytosis inhibitor , yet with pleiotropic effects ( McMahon & Boucrot 2011 ) . 55 Dynamin , a multi - domain protein containing a GTP - ase module , is essential to clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Kirchhausen et al . 2008 ; Macia et al . 2006 ) and interacts with several actin - binding proteins ( Jeng & Welch 2001 ; Orth et al . 2002 ; Kessels et al . 2001 ) . Although the precise mechanism of dynamin is still unclear , a number of studies indicate that it is a mechanochemical enzyme , assembling at the neck of a budding vesicle resulting in membrane fission and vesicle formation ( Preta et al . 2015 ; Kirchhausen et al . 2008 ; Macia et al . 2006 ) . Dynasore is utilised as a reversible inhibitor of dynamin ( Tsai et al . 2009 ; Hernaez & Alonso 2010 ; Barrias et al . 2010 ) , and was used throughout the work in Chapter 5 . This “small interfering molecule” was identified by Macia and colleagues in 2006 whom propose that dynasore inhibits clathrin - mediated endocytosis by acting on two discrete steps : the transition from half formed ( “U” ) pit to fully formed ( “O ) pit , and the subsequent fully formed pit to endocytic vesicle ( Macia et al . 2006 ) . However , as dynamin has also been identified in a number of other pathways ( McMahon & Boucrot 2011 ; Hinshaw 2000 ) , it indicates that dynamin inhibition using dynasore is not specific to clathrin - mediated endocytosis only ( McMahon & Boucrot 2011 ) . Further to this , dynasore has been shown to effect cellular processes involving cholesterol , lipid rafts and actin ( Preta et al . 2015 ) , with the latter more generally associated with several types of endocytosis ( Jeng & Welch 2001 ) . Caveolin dependent endocytosis 1 . 14 . 2 . Endocytic pathways independent of the clathrin protein , such as caveolin dependent endocytosis , was discovered when inhibition of clathrin - dependent endocytosis did not affect the uptake of a number of other types of cargo . There are three types of mammalian caveolin proteins : caveolin - 1 and - 2 are found primarily in non - muscle cells ( with the exception of neurons and leukocytes ) in contrast to caveolin - 3 , which is muscle specific ( Doherty & McMahon 2009 ) . Chemical inhibitors of caveolin dependent ( and lipid - raft dependent - endocytosis ) typically target cholesterol ; for example , inhibition of cholesterol 56 biosynthesis by statins , extraction of cholesterol from the plasma membrane using cyclodextrins , use of filipin and nystatin to sequester cholesterol within the plasma membrane and modification of cholesterol with cholesterol oxidase ( Smart & R . Anderson 2002 ; Ivanov 2008 ) . Clathrin - and Caveolin - independent pathways 1 . 14 . 3 . Extracellular fluid , SV40 virions ( Damm et al . 2005 ) as well as receptors for a number of molecules ( Kirkham & Parton 2005 ) have been shown to be internalised by endocytic events independent of clathrin - and caveolin - 1 endocytosis ( Doherty & McMahon 2009 ) . Additionally , GPI - linked proteins typically undergo endocytosis via a cholesterol - dependent but clathrin - independent pathway ; these associated endosomes are known as GPI - AP - enriched early endosomal compartments ( GEECs ) ( Sabharanjak et al . 2002 ) . In Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells , stably transfected FR α is taken up by the GEEC pathway , which has been shown to be downstream of clathrin - independent carriers ( CLICs ) ( Sabharanjak et al . 2002 ) . This is referred to as a CLIC / GEEC pathway ( Doherty & McMahon 2009 ) and was shown to be tubular ( or “ring shaped” ) in morphology when viewed by EM in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts ( MEFs ) ( Kirkham & Parton 2005 ) . On disruption of the CLIC / GEEC pathway , internalisation of GPI - linked proteins occurs via clathrin - mediated endocytosis instead ( Sabharanjak et al . 2002 ) , although it is unclear whether cargo is delivered to the correct destinations ( Doherty & McMahon 2009 ) . Inhibition of CLIC / GEEC effector proteins such as Cdc42 , Arf1 and GRAF1 , will significantly reduce uptake of cargo ( Nonnenmacher & Webber 2011 ) . Macropinocytosis 1 . 14 . 4 . Bulk and non - specific uptake of extracellular liquid is otherwise known as macropinocytosis , while the mechanisms of uptake described above can be defined as pinocytic ( Doherty & McMahon 2009 ) . First observed in 1931 , macropinocytosis is the earliest understood mechanism of the eukaryotic endocytic pathways ( Kerr & Teasdale 2009 ) . The activation of receptor tyrosine kinases causes a global rise in actin - 57 polymerisation at the cell surface . Rho GTP - ases and phosphoinositide 4 , 5 - bisphosphate initiate actin - polymerisation by activating WASp / Scar proteins . The assembly of Arp2 / 3 complex with an actin monomer onto a pre - existing actin filament are co - ordinated by these proteins . The newly extended actin filament pushes the plasma membrane into a planar membrane ruffle and eventually fuses back with the plasma membrane encapsulating large volumes of fluid while doing so . The mechanism behind the folding back of the ruffles to form macropinosomes is however not fully understood ( Kerr & Teasdale 2009 ) . There are three major inhibitors of macropinocytosis known : agents that target sodium - proton exchange , F - actin polymerisation and phosphoinositide metabolism . These inhibitors can also be used to inhibit phagocytosis ( Ivanov 2008 ) . Throughout the work in Chapter 5 , the sodium - proton exchange inhibitor 5 - ( N - ethyl - N - isopropyl ) amiloride ( EIPA ; a more potent analogue of inhibitor Amiloride ) was used to inhibit membrane ruffling associated with macropinosome formation ( Fretz et al . 2006 ; Kerr & Teasdale 2009 ) . The mechanism by which sodium - proton exchange inhibitors ( such as Amiloride and its analogues ) inhibits macropinocytosis is unknown , but research indicates that macropinocytosis is inhibited by a decrease in cytosolic pH affecting GTPase activation and actin assembly by Amiloride / EIPA action ( Koivusalo et al . 2010 ) . 1 . 15 . Cell culture Developing an in vitro ocular cell based alternative has its benefits in that it can provide species - specific responses , which in turn allows a good basis for clinical predictions ( Kruszewski et al . 1997 ) . Over the last 20 years , corneal cell culture models have been rapidly developed and used to study areas of interest such as corneal response to ophthalmic drugs ( Ranta et al . 2003 ) . In these instances , adherent cells are used , which require an attachment surface . This is typically a tissue culture plastic treated by electric ion discharge for a net negative charge . To further aid cell attachment , surfaces can be 58 treated with a matrix product such as collagen type IV , fibronectin or laminin ( Freshney 2006 ) . In contrast to adherent cells , suspension cell lines do not require treated tissue - culture vessels ; an example of a suspension cell line is lymphocytes ( HL60 cells ) . Models can utilise primary ( cells isolated from donor tissue ) or continuous cell cultures ( cultures that exhibit extended lifespan by chemicals or viruses , also known as transformed or immortalised ) from a range of species . Continuous cell lines typically have a number of advantages over the primary in that the isolation of tissues , subsequent harvesting and purification of cells is not required ( Hornof et al . 2005 ) . Although these cells remain stable for a many passages and can thus provide a large number of cells per experiment in contrast to primary cells , their gene expression profile may significantly change from the native cells ( Tian et al . 2004 ) . Primary cell cultures 1 . 15 . 1 . Primary cultures are difficult to use for in vitro modelling due to their short life span and biological variability ( Toropainen et al . 2001 ) . Studies into obtaining epithelial cells from various parts of the cornea have shown that human ocular limbal epithelium grows better than the peripheral ocular epithelium ( Ebato et al . 1988 ) , whereas the peripheral ocular epithelium grows better than the central corneal epithelium ( Ebato et al . 1987 ) . Human primary corneal cells have been used to study the effect of endogenous basement membrane components ( such as laminin and fibronectin ) on cell attachment ( Ohji et al . 1994 ; Ohji et al . 1993 ) , the proliferative effects of conditioned media and growth factors ( Pancholi et al . 1998 ) and to study toxicity effects of natural tear substitutes ( Geerling et al . 2001 ) . Human corneal epithelial cells ( HCEpiC ) is an example of a primary culture . A disadvantage of such a primary cell line is that these cells will normally only survive a maximum of two passages ( Toropainen et al . 2001 ) . It shows a very low transepithelial 59 electrical resistance ( TEER ) value of 144 Ω / cm 2 , and so even though it forms stratified structures and desmosomal junctions similar to the in vivo situation , its poor epithelial barrier function makes it unsuitable for permeability studies ( Hornof et al . 2005 ) . Transformed cell cultures 1 . 15 . 2 . There are many methods by which primary cells lines may be immortalised . Primary human corneal epithelial cells infected with Adeno 12 - SV40 hybrid virus or transfected with plasmid RSV - T ( Kahn et al . 1993 ) produced HCE - T cells ( transformed human corneal epithelial cell line ) . Dependent on culture conditions , this cell line will grow in a monolayer or in stratified layers . However , abnormal organisation of wing cells in the mid - corneal zone and basal cells can cause problems especially as the significance of such organization is not clear in vivo ( Toropainen et al . 2001 ) . Human corneal epithelial cells immortalised by SV40 infection however exhibits the typical cobblestone - like appearance ( Araki - Sasaki et al . 1995 ) . Primary corneal epithelial cell lines have also been immortalised with transfection of tetracycline - responsive human papilloma virus ( HPV ) 16 - E6 / E7 and exhibit typical corneal cell morphology ( Mohan et al . 2003 ) . Another example of immortalised cell culture are telomerase - immortalised human corneal epithelial cell line ( hTCEpi ) , developed by infection with human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) ( Robertson et al . 2005 ; Gipson et al . 2003 ) . When immortalised with hTERT , the cell line life span increases , exhibits genetic stability and maintains the ability to differentiate ( Morales et al . 2003 ) . Nevertheless , special consideration needs to be observed depending on the application of its use : for instance , although hTERT cells have not shown to induce ( by itself ) cell transformation , it is recommended to proceed with applications such as cell therapy with caution ( Milyavsky et al . 2003 ) . Keratocytes ( fibroblastic cells ) have also been developed to grow continuously as monolayers , and have been seen to form tight barriers between cells ( Niederkorn et al . 60 1990 ; Goskonda et al . 1999 ) . This particular cell culture was however derived from rabbit , and such cells are referred to as SIRC - cells ( Statens Seruminstitut rabbit corneal cells ) . A number of transport and permeability studies have been performed with this cell line ( Dey et al . 2004 ; Talluri et al . 2009 ; Tak et al . 2001 ) . 3 - D corneal models 1 . 15 . 3 . The primary advantage of a 3 - D corneal model is the ability to replicate in vivo environments much more closely than monolayer cultures ( Rönkkö et al . 2016 ) . A number of models have been developed ( Rönkkö et al . 2016 ) , with the first being in 1999 ( Griffith et al . 1999 ) . This very first model of immortalised human corneal cells comprised of the epithelium , stroma and endothelium , which exhibited typical corneal morphology , biochemical marker expression , transparency , ion and fluid transport , and gene expression ( Griffith et al . 1999 ) . However , building such models are technically complex and time - consuming for the limited number of assays they offer ( Rönkkö et al . 2016 ) . Nevertheless , these limitations are being addressed in the form of commercially available 3D models . For example , EpiCorneal™ by MatTek Corporation have developed a tissue model of normal human corneal epithelial cells cultured to form a stratified , squamous epithelium ( https : / / www . mattek . com / products / epicorneal / ; accessed 30 July 2017 ) . More recently , Wang and colleagues have developed a 3 - D corneal tissue model with epithelium , stroma and innervation with the purpose of further understanding the interaction between corneal innervation and corneal tissues ( S . Wang et al . 2017 ) . This particular model however utilises a silk scaffolding system in contrast to the typical collagen based models ( S . Wang et al . 2017 ; Reichl et al . 2004 ; Suuronen et al . 2004 ) . Such silk - based innervated corneal tissue models may be used in addition to animal models for the study of drug development , disease intervention and investigation of corneal physiology ( S . Wang et al . 2017 ) . L929 cell line 1 . 15 . 4 . L929 is a murine fibroblast cell line , where fibroblasts can be found in many types of tissues such as tendon , ligament and skin ( Theerakittayakorn & Bunprasert 2011 ) . L929 61 cells specifically come from fibroblast connective and adipose tissue of a 100 - day old C3H / An male mouse ( ECACC No . 85011425 Mouse C3 ) . Cell lines such as this are useful models as they can consistently provide large volumes of cells for an extensive period of time . L929 cells are routinely used for across many fields of research due to their ability to reproduce and their biological responses ( Thonemann et al . 2002 ) . It is a cell line popular for material biocompatibility testing ( Brétagnol et al . 2008 ; Serrano et al . 2005 ; Zange & Kissel 1997 ) , drug cytotoxicity testing ( Nordin et al . 1991 ; Faria et al . 2009 ) and cell biology studies ( Theerakittayakorn & Bunprasert 2011 ) . The cells can be grown to 80 - 90 % confluency in 2 - 3 days , and this makes them cost efficient and a reproducible cell line . General drawbacks of cell culture models 1 . 15 . 5 . The obvious drawbacks are the ease by which microbial contamination can occur , as well as the accumulation of necrotic cells and depletion of nutrients in the growth medium . Although these are regularly seen in a working tissue culture laboratory , using a sterile technique and robust protocols , their occurrences can be controlled . The main drawback of cell culture models is that they will never replicate perfectly the in vivo interactions of test subjects and the different corneal cell types and layers ( Zhao et al . 2006 ) . 62 1 . 16 . Summary The literature reviewed demonstrates that fluorescein fluorescence as a result of MPS interaction on the corneal surface is poorly understood , with recent studies contradicting the conventional cytotoxicity argument typically used to explain the SICS phenomenon . Staining grid studies such as those conducted by Andrasko et al ( Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ) and Carnt et al ( Carnt , Willcox , et al . 2007 ) report different findings of MPS component accountability towards SICS . It is proposed the that PHMB based MPS induce increased corneal hyperfluorescence ( Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ) , however the study by Carnt et al indicates PQ - 1 based MPS may in fact be responsible ( Carnt , Willcox , et al . 2007 ) . It is also unclear to what extent the physiochemical properties of fluorescein may be effecting the interpretation of fluorescein staining on the ocular surface at the time of observation . In order to improve patient care and to further our understanding of clinical hyperfluorescence , it is vital to understand the chemical basis underpinning MPS - related hyperfluorescence . There are a number of proposed mechanisms of fluorescein hyperfluorescence ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) , however recent research indicates that fluorescein localises within the cytoplasm of individual cells ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ; Bakkar et al . 2014 ; Mokhtarzadeh et al . 2011 ) . The previous work conducted by this laboratory suggests fluorescein hyperfluorescence is an energy requiring process ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) , although the specific mechanism underpinning fluorescein internalisation is unknown . This active transport theory is in contrast to a number of already proposed mechanisms ( for example , the passive mechanism surface pooling and the ingress model as discussed in Section 1 . 12 ) and as such requires further investigation . 63 The overall aims of this work were thus to ( 1 ) explore the physiochemical properties of fluorescein fluorescence , ( 2 ) investigate active transport mechanisms related to fluorescein internalisation and finally ( 3 ) to study the hyperfluorescence inducing capabilities of major MPS components . Chapter 2 Routine methods and protocols 65 2 . 1 . Introduction Described below in detail are the general standard methods and materials used throughout this work . This includes a description of the cell lines used throughout the thesis , the tissue culture methods employed and description of subsequent treatment with MPS , fluorescein and DNA binding dyes . As described , the effect of test treatments was measured by metabolic activity assay or fluorescence microscopy . In some instances fluorescein intensity or cellular uptake were measured by fluorimeter or high content analysis ( HCA ) respectively . Finally , an overview of the statistical analysis applied is described . Chapters 3 through to 6 each contain a separate “Materials and Methods” section describing the specific experimental protocols used . 2 . 2 . Cell lines Murine fibroblast L929 cells ( ECACC No . 85011425 ) were purchased from The European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures ( ECACC UK ) . Human corneal ( HC ) cells were grown from corneas donated by the Manchester Eye Bank ( NHS Blood and Transplant , UK ) . Corneas were pre - consented for research in the case of unsuitability for transplantation ( for example , in the case of low endothelial cell count or incomplete medical history ) . Corneas ( male aged 72 and aged 59 ) were received suspended in maintenance medium . 2 . 3 . Cell culture medium and reagents Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) with High Glucose ( Gibco , UK ) supplement with Fetal Bovine Serum ( 10 % ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) and L - Glutamine , 200mM ( 4mM ) ( Gibco , UK ) , further referred to as growth medium , was used for both L929 and human corneal cell ( HC ) lines . To detach L929 cells from plastic surface , 0 . 25 % Trypsin - EDTA ( Life Technologies , UK ) was used , and 0 . 05 % Trypsin - EDTA in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline ( PBS ; ThermoFisher , UK ) was used for HC cell 66 detachment ; PBS was used to wash attached cells . CTS™ Synth - a - Freeze™ ( Gibco , UK ) , a protein - free liquid cryopreservation medium , was used to for cell cryopreservation . 2 . 4 . Tissue Culture Common Practice All cell lines were maintained in humidified incubators at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Tissue culture ( TC ) flasks used were 25cm 2 and 75cm 2 ( Corning , Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) , and multi - well plates used included 24 and 96 well white , clear bottom plates ( Corning , Sigma Aldrich , UK ) and 96 well black , clear bottom plates ( Greiner Bio - one , UK ) . L929 cell culture passaging 2 . 4 . 1 . Once L929 cells reached 80 - 90 % confluency , cells were washed with PBS ( 5ml ) . Trypsin EDTA ( 5ml ) was used for 5 minutes to detach the cells from the flask . Detached cells were quenched using growth medium ( 10ml ) . Cells and growth medium were then centrifuged at 700rcf for 5minutes . After centrifugation , the supernatant was disposed of and pellet was suspended in growth medium to be seeded at the desired density . Cells were passaged every 2 days in this way . Corneal cell culture and passaging 2 . 4 . 2 . Corneal cells were grown from human corneal explants following protocol adapted from Khan et al , 1993 ( Kahn et al . 1993 ) , and is described in 2 . 4 . 3 . 1 . Human corneal epithelial cells usually appear to have a cobblestone morphology ( Ryeom et al . 2000 ) . Growth on tissue culture plastic can however induce a flatter morphology , and as such collagen coating is required for a more rounded morphology ( Gospodarowicz et al . 1978 ) . Substrate stiffness is also an important factor in modulating appropriate cellular differentiation ( Cozzolino et al . 2016 ) . This model at first exhibited both an epithelial and fibroblast growth from segmented explants in collagen coated wells . Fibroblast growth dominated and outgrew epithelial cell population , which was likely aided by serum - containing growth medium ( Kahn et al . 1993 ) . These cells are used throughout this thesis , and are further referred to as human corneal ( HC ) cells . 67 Figure 12 : Corneal cells grown from explants . Typical epithelial morphology ( arrow ) and fibroblast morphology ( circle ) was seen after 7 days of growth ( left ) . 14 day after growth , fibroblast morphology outgrew all cells with typical epithelial morphology ( right ) . Collagen coating 2 . 4 . 3 . Collagen from calf skin ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) was diluted to 0 . 01 % using dH 2 O and used to coat multi - well plates and TC flasks at room temperature overnight at 100µl / cm 2 . Corneal cell growth from Corneas 2 . 4 . 3 . 1 . Corneas were revived using growth medium in single tissue culture dishes for 7 days , changing the growth medium once . Cornea was then segmented into 8 pieces . 4 segments were placed epithelial side down into a well of a collagen coated 6 well plate . Each segment was allowed to adhere to the surface at room temperature for 20 minutes before pipetting a drop of growth medium to each segment , and incubating at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 for 2 nights . Thereafter , growth medium ( 3ml ) was added to each well and cell growth was evaluated every 2 nights . Once cells proliferated away from each corneal segment , segments were removed . Growth medium was changed in wells every 2 nights until 80 % confluency was reached . Passaging human corneal cells 2 . 4 . 3 . 2 . Human corneal cells were washed with PBS ( 1ml ) before treating with 0 . 05 % Trypsin EDTA ( 1ml ) for 4 minutes at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Once cells had detached from the well , 10 % FBS in PBS ( 2ml ) was added to Trypsin EDTA / cell suspension to neutralise . 7 day growth 14 day growth 68 Suspension was centrifuged at 300rcf for 5 minutes . Supernatant was removed , and pellet was re - suspended in growth medium . Cells were seeded using into tissue culture flasks at 1x10 4 cells / cm 2 .

Frosty freezing container and then transferred to liquid nitrogen storage after 24 hours . Thawing cells 2 . 4 . 5 . A cryovial was removed from liquid nitrogen storage , and transported to tissue culture hood on dry ice . Immediately , it was placed in a 37°C water bath , and defrosted until a small piece of ice remained . Under sterile condition , cells were transferred into a 15ml falcon tube . Drop wise , pre - warmed growth medium was added to the falcon tube of cells and then transferred to T25 flask . After overnight attachment at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 , spent growth medium was removed and replaced with fresh growth medium . 2 . 5 . MPS and fluorescein treatment of cells Cells treated with MPS 2 . 5 . 1 . The MPS used throughout this thesis are Bausch + Lomb ( Kingston upon Thames , UK ) solutions Biotrue® and ReNu Sensitive Multi - purpose solution® ( previously known as ReNu Multipurpose solution ) , Opti - Free RepleniSH® ( Alcon ; Surrey , UK ) and Complete Revitalens® ( AMO ; High Wycombe , UK ) . A summary of MPS components can be seen in Table 4 . These solutions clinically exhibit a range of fluorescein staining as seen in www . stainingrid . com by Andrasko and colleagues ( Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ) , as well as in studies by Jones et al , 2002 and Kilvington et al , 2010 ( L . Jones et al . 2002 ; Kilvington et al . 2010 ) . Solutions were stored according to manufacturers instructions at room 69 temperature and out of direct sunlight , and were replaced after three months of opening . Cells were seeded using growth medium into 24 well plates at 1x10 5 cells / ml ( 1ml per well ) , or into 96 well plates at 2 . 5x10 4 cells / 100µl , and were grown overnight . After overnight incubation , growth medium was removed and cells were then incubated with MPS ( 1ml in 24 well plate , 100µl in 96 well plate ) for 2 hours . Fresh growth medium was added to control cells for the same 2 hours . Table 4 : MPS formulations . MPS are referred to by biocide and surfactant combinations .

Fluorescein treatment of cells 2 . 5 . 2 . A 0 . 1 % w / v fluorescein ( Fluorescein Sodium Salt ; Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) solution was first prepared in PBS . This was then diluted using PBS 1 : 10 to make a 0 . 01 % w / v solutions . This was filtered using a 0 . 22 µ m filter . After MPS , and growth medium treatment for 2 hours , solutions were removed and cells were incubated with fluorescein ( 0 . 01 % w / v in PBS unless otherwise stated , 1ml or 100µl dependent on well size ) for 10 minutes .

Plates were taken for quantitative or qualitative analysis by HCA ( Section 2 . 9 ) or microscopy ( Section 2 . 7 ) respectively . Cell staining with DNA - binding dyes 2 . 5 . 3 . In the instance of nuclei and necrosis identification , Hoechst 33342 and Propidium Iodide ( PI ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) , at final concentrations 0 . 2mg / ml and 0 . 01mg / ml respectively , were incubated with fluorescein for 10 minutes at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . All solutions were prepared using PBS and filtered using a 0 . 22 µ m filter . 2 . 6 . Metabolic activity assay This quantitative colorimetric assay measures living mammalian cells only by reduction of 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide , commonly known as MTT , to formazan ( Mosmann 1983 ) ( Figure 13 ) . The absorption of solubilised formazan is proportional to metabolic activity and in turn is proportional to cell viability . Absorption can be measured using wavelengths anywhere between 540 and 690nm . After conducting a wavelength scan to find optimum wavelength , formazan absorption was read at 555nm throughout this thesis . Figure 13 : Reduction of MTT to formazan . Cells were cultured in 96 well plates , and treated with test treatments , and incubation periods were dependent on assay . In appropriate wells , cells were then treated with 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein for 10 minutes at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . All treatments were then removed N N + N N Br - N S CH 3 CH 3 N N NH N N S CH 3 CH 3 HBr + 2H + 71 and replaced with thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) prepared using growth medium at a final concentration of 0 . 5mg / ml , and was incubated for 2 hours at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Subsequently , growth medium and MTT were removed and the remaining formazan was solubilised with 100µl of Dimethyl Sulfoxide ( DMSO ; Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) . Absorbance was then recorded at 555nm . The absorbance value of each test treatment was expressed as a ratio of the median absorbance value of the appropriate control . The median metabolic activity of each test treatment was then expressed as a percentage of the appropriate control with the associated median 95 % confidence intervals . 2 . 7 . Microscopy Microscopy images were captured using the methods described below . All microscopy images were processed using ImageJ , accessed using FIJI ( Schindelin et al . 2012 ) . Confocal microscopy 2 . 7 . 1 . A Leica TCS SP8 AOBS inverted gSTED microscope using a 40x / 1 . 3 HC PL APO ( Oil ) objective and 1x confocal zoom was used to take confocal slice images . The confocal settings were set as pinhole 1 . 12 airy unit , scan speed 400Hz unidirectional , and format 1024 x 1024 . Fluorescein stained cells were acquired using the 488nm excitation laser line . Snapshot fluorescence microscope 2 . 7 . 2 . Widefield fluorescence images were captured on an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope using a 10x / 0 . 3 UPlanFL N or 20x / 0 . 45 LUC PlanFL N ( Ph1 ) objective , and an Orca ER camera ( Hamamatsu ) through CellSens software ( Olympus ) . Specific band pass filter sets ( λ Emission / λ Excitation ) for Hoecsht 33342 ( 350 / 50 / 460 / 50 ) , fluorescein ( 480 / 40 / 535 / 50 ) and PI staining ( 560 / 55 / 645 / 75 ) were used to prevent bleed through from one channel to another . 72 2 . 8 . Fluorescein fluorescence intensity measurement by spectrofluorimetery Fluorescein at various concentrations and in various solvents was aliquoted into 96 well plates ( 100µl per well ) , using appropriate blanks as a control . That is , the solvent used to prepare fluorescein in solution constitutes an appropriate blank control . Fluorescein was excited at 485nm , and emission was recorded at 520nm using Fluostar microplate reader ( BMG Labtech GMBH , Ortenburg , Germany ) . The gain was automatically adjusted per plate to allow for optimum signal amplification . Fluorescein intensities are reported as the median value of intensities recorded in Arbitrary Units ( AU ) , unless otherwise stated . 2 . 9 . Analysis of fluorescein uptake using High Content Analysis ( HCA ) The high content analysis ( HCA ) system is a high throughput automated fluorescence imaging platform that utilises image analysis algorithms to rapidly provide qualitative and quantitative information of multiple parameters from large volumes of bioimages ( Johnston 2008 ; Shariff et al . 2010 ) . HCA was performed using the platform located at the laboratory of Imagen Therapeutics Ltd ( Manchester , UK ) . Image acquisition 2 . 9 . 1 . Fluorescein fluorescence intensity was measured in clear bottomed , black walled 96 well plates using the Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS Reader , and the accompanying HCS Studio Cell 2 . 0 Analysis Software ( Cellomics , ThermoFisher ) . Cells were visualised using the ArrayScan ™ automated Observer Z1 inverted microscope ( Zeiss ) with transmitted light and fluorescence using XF53 filter wheel . High - resolution images were taken using a CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Orca ER ) with a 5x / 0 . 25 Fluar objective . Images of fluorescein stained cells were taken using 0 . 033 seconds exposure across all experiments . One field of view was taken per well , with multiple wells per treatment tested , to enable quick data collection . An ice pack was kept on top of the plates as they were imaged to limit fluorescein loss from cells . 73 Image analysis 2 . 9 . 2 . Image analysis was conducted using the ArrayScan HCS Reader software ( Cellomics , ThermoFisher ) , and the built in biopplication ‘Compartmental Analysis’ was used . To measure the fluorescence pixel intensity , the algorithm first identified cell nuclei by Hoecsht 33342 staining , which was adjusted to ensure the boundary of each nucleus was correctly identified . The number of cells imaged was identified this way . The space surrounding the nuclei was then adjusted to correctly identify individual cells and exclude cell debris . The mean pixel intensity of fluorescein stained cells in this space was then measured using the built in algorithms for biological analysis . This allowed the mean pixel intensity of every cell in a treatment across multiple wells to be curated . This data was then reported as the median or mean value of fluorescein intensity in Arbitrary Units ( AU ) . 2 . 10 . Statistical analysis All data was presented and analysed using GraphPad Prism version 7 . 00 for Mac OS X ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla California , USA ) unless otherwise stated . Unless otherwise specified , data was analysed by non - parametric Kruskal - Wallis ANOVA and Dunn’s multiple comparison post - hoc tests , and values were typically expressed as the median and the associated median lower 95 % CI ( confidence interval ) – upper 95 % CI limits . In some instances as stated , data was analysed using a 2 - way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test or by Mann - Whitney test . Three levels of significance were set to * p = 0 . 05 , * * p = 0 . 01 and * * * p ≤ 0 . 001 across all tests . 74 Chapter 3 Development of methods for fluorescein quantification in cell culture experiments . 75 3 . 1 . Abstract Purpose : To develop a method by which to quantify fluorescein fluorescence in cell culture . Methods : Murine fibroblasts were treated with MPS formulations and fluorescein before fluorescence quantification by fluorescence microscopy and ImageJ , flow cytometry and high content analysis ( HCA ) . Each method was analysed to determine the most predictive of fluorescence intensity typically observed by both hyperfluorescence and non - hyperfluorescence inducing MPS clinically . Results : Fluorescein quantification by ImageJ and flow cytometry requires manual thresholding ; that is , user must determine a level of hyperfluorescence . Although flow cytometry was seen to provide a high throughput method by which to quantify hyperfluorescence in cell culture , not all MPS formulations could be tested using this system , thus limiting the scope of this work . Fluorescein quantification by HCA however allows numerical analysis of fluorescence intensity induced by all test formulations , where the data can then be statistically analysed . Conclusion : Due to the high throughput nature of HCA equipment and having experienced no compatibility issues with MPS test formulations and this system , it was determined that HCA would be used to quantify cellular uptake of fluorescein . 76 3 . 2 . Introduction Fluorescein hyperfluorescence ( ‘staining’ ) can be observed clinically on the ocular surface using slit - lamp biomicroscopy and then is typically analysed using various semi - quantitative grading systems ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . The assessment of fluorescein intensity is a critical step in observing solution induced corneal staining ( SICS ) , which is a type of fluorescein staining observed after use of certain contact lens and multi - purpose solutions ( MPS ) . It has been assumed by many studies that more intense fluorescein staining , or ‘hyperfluorescence’ , is associated with poorer ocular health , although there is little evidence for a correlation of this increased hyperfluorescence with damaged or dying cells . For example , PHMB - based MPS are most commonly associated with SICS ( Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ; Carnt , Willcox , et al . 2007 ; L . Jones et al . 2002 ; Lebow & Schachet 2003 ; Pritchard et al . 2003 ; Garofalo et al . 2005 ) . However , a number of in vitro studies show it is PQ - 1 - based MPS , solutions typically not associated with increased hyperfluorescence , that cause notable membrane disruption and increased membrane permeability ( Tchao et al . 2002 ) , decreases in cellular viability and in some instances , necrosis ( Choy et al . 2012 ; Wright & Mowrey - McKee 2005 ; Dutot et al . 2008 ; Dutot et al . 2010 ) . Quantification of fluorescein hyperfluorescence in cell culture has previously been carried out in response to MPS ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) and stress stimuli ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) . Confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to evaluate fluorescein uptake in response to various stress stimuli ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) , and although this provides a wealth of qualitative information ( for example , providing insight into fluorescein localisation and health of fluorescein stained cells ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ; Bakkar et al . 2014 ) , it is dependent on the equipment and microscopy settings used to capture each image , making comparisons between such studies difficult . For example , in the Bandamwar et al . study , images were processed using ImageJ software and fluorescein uptake was quantified and 77 categorised into low , moderate and hyper - fluorescence intensities ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) . However the threshold values that were used to assign these intensity categories are unclear . Similarly the use of ‘ready made’ software and subsequent analysis of hyper - fluorescence to study fluorescein staining , such as in the study by Peterson et al on the anterior eye , ( Peterson et al . 2006 ) also results in uncertainties about the real levels of fluorescein , which can cause difficulties with data reproducibility and comparisons . Flow cytometry , in contrast to fluorescence microscopy , is a method that can rapidly provide both quantitative , and in some instances qualitative , information on thousands of fluorophore labelled cells , where fluorophores are often conjugated to an antibody of interest . Briefly , using a sheath of isotonic fluid creating a laminar flow , cells in suspension are drawn through an interrogation point . At this interrogation point , a beam of monochromatic light illuminates each cell and the emitted light and the respective wavelengths of each fluorophore are isolated by a series of filters and dichroic mirrors . These light signals are amplified using photomultiplier tubes , digitised for analysis , and presented either as a histogram or as a 2 - dimensional dot - plot ( Macey 2007 ) . Flow cytometry can be used for cytokine quantification ( Prussin & Metcalfe 1995 ) , to study lymphocyte division ( Lyons & Parish 1994 ) and in cancer research , as a tool to diagnose abnormal DNA content , or RNA / haematological cancers ( Barlogie et al . 1983 ) . In ophthalmology it has been used to study the biocidal effects of MPS formulations . For example anti - ameobal efficacies ( Borazjani & Kilvington 2005 ) , apoptosis in human conjunctival cells ( Dutot et al . 2010 ) and cytotoxicity in human corneal - limbal epithelial cells ( Lim et al . 2009 ) all in response to a number of MPS formulations , have been studied using flow cytometry . However , to date flow cytometry appears not to have been used to quantify fluorescein fluorescence intensity . 78 Recently in this laboratory , high content analysis ( HCA ) was used to quantify fluorescein uptake by cells ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . HCA is a high throughput automated fluorescence imaging platform that utilises image analysis algorithms to rapidly provide qualitative and quantitative information of multiple parameters from large volumes of bioimages ( Johnston 2008 ; Shariff et al . 2010 ) . HCA , also referred to as high content screening ( HCS ) , is a useful tool in drug discovery and development ( Giuliano et al . 1997 ; Giuliano et al . 2003 ; Bertelsen & Sanfridson 2005 ; Grove & Ghosh 2006 ) . It has been used to study receptor internalisation ( Conway et al . 1999 ) and acetylation of the cytokeratin cytoskeleton ( Drake et al . 2009 ) . In previous work in this laboratory , HCA was utilised to measure the effect of ReNu MultiPlus® MPS on fluorescein uptake , and it was found that cells treated with this MPS also showed increased fluorescein staining in cells , similar to the findings reported clinically for this solution ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . Fluorescein fluorescence intensities were reported using the ‘ % High - CircSpotAverage area’ feature provided by the accompanying HCA software . This specific feature however provides no information on the actual intensity values of individual fluorescein stained cells . This quantification step thus requires further work . Throughout this thesis , the aim was to investigate the biological mechanisms underpinning , and chemical inducers contributing to , fluorescein uptake in murine fibroblasts ( L929 cells ) and human corneal ( HC ) cells . The development of a robust method to quantify fluorescein intensity was vital . Therefore , in this chapter fluorescence microscopy with Image J analysis , flow cytometry and a high content analysis ( HCA ) platform were each explored to identify the best method of fluorescein fluorescence quantification for later planned in vitro studies . 79 3 . 3 . Methods and Materials Fluorescein quantification by fluorescence microscopy and Image J analysis 3 . 3 . 1 . Fluorescein treated cell culture preparation for fluorescence microscopy 3 . 3 . 1 . 1 . Cultured L929 cells ( ECACC No . 85011425 ) were grown overnight in growth medium at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 in 24 well plates as described in Section 2 . 5 . Briefly , growth medium was aspirated and MPS associated with hyperfluorescence , ReNu Sensitive Multi - purpose solution® ( Bausch + Lomb , UK ) ( hereafter referred to as P - 1107 ) , was added to cells and incubated for 2 hours ; growth medium was used as a control treatment . All solutions were then aspirated and replaced with 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein ( Fluorescein Sodium Salt , Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline ( PBS ; ThermoFisher , UK ) ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) and 0 . 2mg / ml Hoechst 33342 ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) in PBS ( to identify cell nuclei ) for 10 minutes . All wells were then washed with cold PBS and the plates were incubated at 4°C ( to prevent loss of fluorescein from cells ) until image acquisition . Image acquisition by fluorescence microscopy 3 . 3 . 1 . 2 . Widefield fluorescence images were captured as described in Section 2 . 7 . 2 . Briefly , fluorescence microscopy images were acquired using an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope with a 20x / 0 . 45 LUC PlanFL N ( Ph1 ) objective . Images were captured using an Orca ER camera ( Hamamatsu ) through CellSens software ( Olympus ) . Specific band pass filter sets ( λ Emission / λ Excitation ) for Hoecsht 33342 ( 350 / 50 / 460 / 50 ) and fluorescein ( 480 / 40 / 535 / 50 ) were used to prevent any bleed through between channels . Image analysis using ImageJ software 3 . 3 . 1 . 3 . Fluorescence microscopy images were assessed using ImageJ software accessed through the FIJI distribution package ( Schindelin et al . 2012 ) . The particle threshold feature available on ImageJ was manually adjusted to allow the software to count the number of cells per image . This was found to be more difficult for cells with irregular morphology ( e . g . murine fibroblast ) , and so the particle threshold was set manually with every image to 80 ensure the maximum numbers of cells were included in all analyses ( Figure 14 ) . ImageJ was then instructed to generate the mean pixel intensity of each cell . Figure 14 : Screenshot example of thresholding process using FIJI software . Thresholding feature is accessed Image > Adjust > Threshold ( A ) . Once thresholding feature is active , it can be manually adjusted to maximise number of cells used in subsequent pixel intensity measurements ( B ) . A B 81 Methods to present data acquired from Image J analysis 3 . 3 . 1 . 4 . All data generated in ImageJ software was transferred to GraphPad Prism version 7 . 00 for Mac OS X ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla California , USA ) for further processing and plotting . A number of ways to present the pixel intensity data from each image were then explored : ( 1 ) Report cells above the modal intensities for each treatment . All pixel intensities were sorted to display those from the smallest to largest pixel intensity . The number of cells exhibiting fluorescence above the modal intensity were counted , and reported as exhibiting increased hyperfluorescence . ( 2 ) Identify the average pixel intensity of a select few bright cells , and report any other cells that were within the standard deviation ( SD ) of this value . Firstly , six cells per treatment that exhibited increased hyper - fluorescence was identified ‘by eye’ . Cells exhibiting increased hyperfluorescence were defined as cells that appeared brighter than the overall fluorescein stained cellular population in the image . The average pixel intensity ± SD was then calculated and referred to as the ‘increased hyperfluorescence range’ . All cells exhibiting fluorescence within this range were reported as displaying increased fluorescein uptake . ( 3 ) Determine a threshold above which cells are considered to be exhibiting increased hyperfluorescence . All pixel intensities were sorted from the smallest to largest pixel intensity . The top 10 , 25 and 50 % of the brightest cells ( i . e . those exhibiting the greatest mean pixel intensity ) were reported as displaying increased fluorescein uptake . Flow cytometry 3 . 3 . 2 . Fluorescein treated cell culture preparation for flow cytometry 3 . 3 . 2 . 1 . L929 cells were cultured overnight in 24 well plates as described in Section 2 . 5 . 1 . Cells were then incubated with media control , or with the MPS Biotrue ( Bausch + Lomb , UK ; hereafter referred to as P - PQ1 - 1107 ) , P - 1107 ( both of which have been associated with 82 hyperfluoresence clinically ) , Opti - free Replenish ( Alcon ) and Complete Revitalens ( AMO ) ( referred to as PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 respectively , and both of which clinically do not cause hyperfluorescence ) for 2 hours . Cells were then treated with 0 . 0001 % w / v fluorescein for 10 minutes , as saturation of fluorescence was seen with concentrations of fluorescein greater than using this flow cytometry platform . Cells were then detached using 500µl 0 . 25 % Trypsin - EDTA , pelleted and resuspended in cold PBS at 1x10 6 cells / ml . Cells were stored in 1 . 5ml Eppendorf tubes and kept on ice prior to flow cytometry analysis . Data acquisition and presentation 3 . 3 . 2 . 2 . Samples were loaded onto the imaging cytometer ImageStream ®X Mark II ( AMNIS® Imaging Flowcytometers by Merck , UK ) at 300 cells per second . This particular flow cytometry platform also captures an image of each cell that passes through , however this information was not required for our analysis . The fluorescence intensity of fluorescein stained cells were collected from Channel 2 and were measured using a 488nm laser with band pass filters 480 / 560nm . Using the accompanying IDEAS® software package , the fluorescence exhibited by cells alone ( auto - fluorescence from media treated cells only ) was subtracted from the fluorescein fluorescence profiles of cells treated with media control , P - 1107 and P - PQ1 - 1107 . PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 treated cells could not be analysed due to degradation of samples . This was most likely due to the cytotoxic effect of these solutions . 83 Figure 15 : Screengrab of IDEAS® software package . Both qualitative ( cell images ) and quantitative information can be collected using this software ; FITC - ( in orange ) represents auto - fluorescence and FITC + ( yellow ) represents fluorescein stained cells . High content analysis ( HCA ) 3 . 3 . 3 . Fluorescein treated cell culture preparation for HCA 3 . 3 . 3 . 1 . L929 cells were treated with varying solutions of MPS and media control as described above and in Section 2 . 5 . Cells were additionally treated with 0 . 2mg / ml Hoechst 33342 and 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein ( both solutions prepared in PBS ) for 10 minutes . Cells were washed with cold PBS with this being carried out within 5 minutes after fluorescein incubation and kept cold prior to HCA . Image acquisition 3 . 3 . 3 . 2 . Fluorescein fluorescence intensity was measured in clear bottomed , black walled 96 - well plates using the Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS Reader , and the accompanying HCS Studio Cell 2 . 0 Analysis Software ( Cellomics , ThermoFisher ) . Cells were visualised using the ArrayScan ™ automated Observer Z1 inverted microscope ( Zeiss ) with transmitted light and fluorescence using XF53 filter wheel . High - resolution images were taken using a CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Orca ER ) with a 5x / 0 . 25 Fluar objective . Fluorescein stained cells images were taken using 0 . 033 seconds exposure across all experiments . One field of 84 view was taken per well , with multiple wells per treatment tested , to enable quick data collection . An ice pack was kept on top of the plates as they were imaged to minimise fluorescein loss from cells . Image analysis 3 . 3 . 3 . 3 . Image analysis was carried out using the ArrayScan HCS Reader software ( Cellomics , ThermoFisher ) , and the built in bioapplication ‘Compartmental Analysis’ was used . To measure the fluorescence pixel intensity , the algorithm first identified cell nuclei by Hoecsht 33342 staining , which was adjusted to ensure the boundary of each nucleus was correctly identified . The number of cells imaged was identified this way . The space surrounding the nuclei was then adjusted to correctly identify individual cells and exclude cell debris . The mean pixel intensity of each pixel in fluorescein stained cells in this space was then measured using the built in algorithms for biological analysis . This allowed the mean pixel intensity of every cell in a treatment across multiple wells to be calculated , hereafter referred to as ‘fluorescence intensity’ . Figure 16 : Example of ArrayScan HCS Reader software identifying cell boundaries . ( A ) Initial identification of cell boundaries ( outlined in blue ) . ( B ) Software identifies cells that are larger than expected ( outlined in red ) and cells that are in close proximity and therefore recognised as one individual cell ( outlined in yellow ) ; software can now be adjusted accordingly . A B 85 Presentation of data acquired from HCA 3 . 3 . 3 . 4 . Two methods for presenting fluorescein fluorescence intensities were explored : ( 1 ) The fluorescence intensities of all treatments expressed as a ratio of media control treated cells only . The mean fluorescence intensity per treatment was first calculated . The mean fluorescence after each MPS treatment was then divided by the mean fluorescence intensity of the media control treated - cells only . This generated a ratio of what was referred to as increased hyperfluorescence . ( 2 ) The fluorescence intensity of each treatment reported as the median fluorescence value of the cell population . The fluorescence intensity of each cell in the cell population per treatment was curated from the smallest to largest pixel intensity value . The median fluorescence intensity was then reported per treatment . Effect of cell confluency on fluorescein uptake when measured by HCA 3 . 3 . 3 . 5 . The effect of cell confluency was briefly investigated using L929 cells . Cells were counted and seeded into a 96 well plate at 1000 cells / well , 500 cells / well , 250 cells / well and 62 . 5 cells / well in growth medium ( 100µl per well ) . This was performed in duplicate and cells were incubated at 37°C overnight . Growth medium was then aspirated and cells were treated with 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein and 0 . 2mg / ml Hoechst 33342 ( both prepared in PBS ) for 10 minutes at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Treatment solutions were removed , and washed with cold PBS before fluorescein quantification by HCA . 3 . 4 . Results and Discussion Fluorescein quantification by fluorescence microscopy and Image J analysis 3 . 4 . 1 . Image analysis using Image J software 3 . 4 . 1 . 1 . The first step required for ImageJ analysis of fluorescent images was identification of each cell in the image . However , cells that were situated closely together could not be identified as individual cells or were omitted from the analysis all together . Examples of this can be seen in Figure 17 : groups of cells were mistakenly identified as one individual cell ( red 86 A B C D circles ) where individual cells were identified as more than one cell ( red rectangles ) or some cells were not identified at all ( yellow rectangles ) . These types of inaccuracies occurred consistently in all images analysed . As such , cellular boundaries had to be identified manually and could not be applied across images due to the variation in cell morphology . A weakness of this method is that it relies on extensive manual input , and so is time - consuming and potentially subjective . Figure 17 : Fluorescence microscopy images processed using ImageJ . ( A ) and ( C ) respectively show fluorescence microscopy images of cultured L929 cells treated with media control or P - 1107 followed by 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein . ( B ) and ( D ) Cells were identified by particle threshold analysis . Images were acquired using 20x magnification and are representative of several fields of view and experiments . Scale bars represent 100µm . After boundary identification , the mean pixel intensity was measured for each cell as seen in Figure 18 . Of the cells measured for fluorescence intensities , an overall increase was observed in P - 1107 cells . Notably , each histogram began with a large peak for the lowest of the pixel intensities measured , which represents the ‘background’ lowest level of fluorescence for each treatment . To eliminate this background fluorescence would require further processing of the fluorescence microscopy images . It is likely that this in turn 87 would also affect the intensities measured in the remaining cell population and so may no longer accurately represent fluorescence captured . Figure 18 : The mean pixel intensities of fluorescein treated cells . ( A ) and ( B ) respectively show the mean pixel intensities of L929 cells treated with media control or P - 1107 , followed by 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein . Various methods to present data acquired from ImageJ analysis 3 . 4 . 1 . 2 . The total number of cells analysed for pixel intensity in P - 1107 treated cells was 350 L929 cells , and 259 L929 cells after treatment with media control . The results for the various methods of analysing the data are described below . ( 1 ) Report cells above the modal intensities for each treatment The modal pixel intensity was identified , and the number of cells exhibiting fluorescence above this was quantified and taken to indicate numbers exhibiting increased hyperfluorescence ( Table 5 ) . This method indicates 220 media control treated cells exhibit increased hyperfluorescence whereas P - 1107 exhibits 222 cells showing increased 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 0 50 100 150 Mean pixel intensity ( AU ) N o . o f c e ll s 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 0 10 20 30 40 50 Mean pixel intensity ( AU ) N o . o f ce ll s A B 88 hyperfluorescence ; this is only a slight and arguably insignificant increase compared to media control . This is in contrast to the findings of Bakkar et al whom using an in vitro model showed 27 . 1±3 . 0 % of ReNu MultiPlus® MPS ( similar in formulation to P - 1107 ) treated L929 cells exhibited increased fluorescein uptake compared to only 5 . 7±1 . 1 % of control treated L929 cells ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . It is also in contrast to an extensive clinical study demonstrating that P - 1107 induces increased hyperfluorescence above that of the control saline treatments ( Andrasko Corneal Staining Grid accessible at www . staninggrid . com ) ( Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ) . Furthermore , this finding suggests that the majority of the cells within the image field of view exhibit increased hyperfluorescence , which does not match what can be seen in Figure 17A and C . It was concluded that reporting the modal intensity of each treatment does not accurately represent the effects of each treatment . Table 5 : Quantifying the number of hyperfluorescent cells as those presenting above the modal pixel intensity . ( 2 ) Identify the average pixel intensity of a select few bright cells , and report any other cells that were within the standard deviation ( SD ) of this value Firstly , six cells were selected from each treatment that exhibited increased hyperfluorescence . The average pixel intensity was then calculated and referred to as the ‘increased hyperfluorescence range’ . The ranges calculated were 22 . 67 ± 1 . 03 AU and 53 . 29 ± 4 . 98 AU for media control and P - 1107 treated cells respectively . The number of cells within this increased hyperfluorescence range per population was quantified ( Table Total no . of cells No . of cell at modal intensity No . of cells above modal intensity Media control 259 39 220 P - 1107 350 128 222 89 6 ) . The number of P - 1107 treated cells within this range was 17 whereas only 10 media control treated cells fell within its respective range . Although this is more in line with previous findings ( that is fewer media control treated cells exhibit hyperfluorescence that P - 1107 treated cells ) the number of cells calculated for P - 1107 once again does not correlate with what can be seen in Figure 17C . Furthermore , the increased hyperfluorescence range of each population differs with the treatment , which introduces a variable that cannot be standardised across treatments . We concluded that this method of data analysis also does not accurately reflect the effect of each treatment . Table 6 : Quantifying the number of hyperfluorescent cells as those presenting within hyperfluorescence range . ( 3 ) Determine a threshold above which cells are considered to be exhibiting increased hyperfluorescence The brightest pixel intensity measured in the media control treatment was 25 AU , whereas this was 60 AU for P - 1107 treated cells ( Figure 18 ) . The top 10 , 25 and 50 % of the brightest media control and P - 1107 treated cells are show in Table 7 . These thresholds could be applied across experiments allowing for a standardised method with which to analyse fluorescence data . However given that these are arbitrary hyperfluorescence thresholds applied to define increased fluorescein uptake , this method still requires a manual decision to identify the threshold that is the most representative of the true increased hyperfluorescent population .

The number of increased hyperfluorescent cells per image is highly dependent on the ‘rule’ applied using ImageJ analysis . As this method of fluorescein quantification does not accurately define the number of cells per image , and a method of threshholding could not be agreed upon , other methods of fluorescein uptake quantification were explored , such as flow cytometry . Flow cytometry 3 . 4 . 2 . The total number of cells measured per sample was 5000 cells . The mean fluorescence intensity of media control treated L929 cells after background subtraction was 152907 AU where 10 . 2 % of the cell population was eliminated as exhibiting autofluorescence . The mean fluorescence intensity after background subtraction with P - 1107 and P - PQ1 - 1107 treatments was 218726 AU and 191302 AU respectively . Of the cell populations , 13 % and 22 . 7 % were respectively eliminated as exhibiting autofluorescence . Figure 19 : Fluorescence of L929 cells treated with media control , P - 1107 and P - PQ1 - 1107 and fluorescein ( left to right ) .

However fluorescence levels after MPS PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 treatment could not be assessed using this equipment , as they became viscous after trypsinisation ( presumably due to a cytotoxic effect of the two solutions ) , and would have caused damage to the flow cytometer if used . With this method of fluorescein quantification , the proportion of increased hyperfluorescent cells would have to be manually determined through a ‘gating’ process . That is , the threshold above which cells considered to be exhibiting increased fluorescein uptake would be required to be manually inputted into the software . A further weakness of this method is that adherent cells , including L929 cells , must be detached from the tissue culture plastic surface . Normally such cells only undergo detachment for further passaging . It cannot be determined whether this additional detachment step affects the fluorescein distribution within the cells , and hence the levels of fluorescence measured . Additionally , cells treated with solutions such as PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 could not be successfully detached from the flask by trypsinisation , limiting the applicability of this method . High content analysis ( HCA ) microscopy platform was therefore next explored as a potentially more suitable method for fluorescein quantification after all treatments . High content analysis by ArrayScan 3 . 4 . 3 . ( 1 ) Fluorescence expressed as a ratio of the average intensity of media control treated cells only On averaging the fluorescence intensity of all treatments , fluorescence intensities were expressed as a ratio of the average intensity of media control treated cells ( n = 5 wells ) . It was seen that P - 1107 ( n = 6 wells ) and P - PQ1 - 1107 ( n = 6 wells ) treated cells respectively 92 exhibited a 5 . 2 and 11 . 0 fold increase in fluorescein uptake , which are both MPS clinically associated with an increase in hyperfluorescence . Treatment with PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 ( n = 6 wells ) and PQ1 - Alex - 904 ( n = 6 wells ) exhibited a decrease in fluorescein uptake compared to media control ( 0 . 004 and 0 . 01 fold ‘increase’ in fluorescence compared to media control respectively ) , and both of these MPS are clinically associated with minimal ocular hyperfluorescence ( Figure 20 ) . This method of data processing however does not provide information about the intensity of fluorescence per treatment . It also requires data processing that may be difficult and time consuming for larger assays . Figure 20 : Fold increase in fluorescence intensity of MPS treated cells relative to media control . ( 2 ) Fluorescence reported as the median fluorescence value of the population On presenting the same data as the median fluorescence intensity of each treatment where the error bars represent the lower 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) and upper 95 % CI , a similar trend in fluorescence was observed . Statistical significance was determined using non - parametric Kruskal Wallis ANOVA and post - hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison test , and significance was set to * p = 0 . 05 , * * p = 0 . 001 and * * * p ≤ 0 . 0001 . Compared to the media control ( 1 . 5 AU ( 1 . 3 - 1 . 8 AU ) ) , the median fluorescence intensities significantly increased with P - 1107 and P - PQ1 - 1107 treatments ( 8 . 8 AU ( 7 . 6 - 10 . 6 AU ) ; p < 0 . 0001 and 7 . 3 AU ( 4 . 9 - 10 AU ) ; p = 0 . 0002 respectively ) . The median fluorescence intensities decreased with P - 1107 P - P Q 1 - 1107 P Q 1 - A l d ox - 1304 P Q 1 - A l e x - 904 0 5 10 15 Treatment F l u o re s ce n ce a s a r a t i o o f m e d i a c o n t r o l 93 PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 treatments ( 0 AU ( 0 - 0 AU ) and 0 AU ( 0 - 0 AU ) respectively ; p < 0 . 0001 in both instances ) ( Figure 21 ) . This method of data presentation enables a representative quantification of the fluorescence intensities measured without further processing of the data . It was agreed that fluorescence intensities that were significantly greater that the media control would be defined as exhibiting increased hyperfluorescence . A limitation of HCA however is that it does not allow the co - staining of propidium iodide ( PI ) and fluorescein as there is an overlap is their emission profiles . This resulted in inaccurate assessment of PI staining in cell populations ( data not shown ) and as such , necrosis could not be measured in the same population as fluorescein treated cells using this method .

Effect of cell confluency on fluorescein uptake when measured by HCA 3 . 4 . 3 . 1 . The effect of cell confluency on fluorescein uptake was investigated using L929 cells . Only cells in the field of view of the HCA camera were counted using Hoechst 33342 staining . The number of cells counted by HCA after overnight growth at the various starting seeding densities is shown in Table 8 . The fluorescein fluorescence intensity per M e d i a c o n t r o l P - 1107 P - P Q 1 - 1107 P Q 1 - A l d ox - 1304 P Q 1 - A l e x - 904 0 5 10 15 Treatment F L ﬂu o re s ce n ce i n t e n s i t y p er ce ll ( AU ) * * * * * * * * * * * * 94 cell was measured ( n = 2 wells ) and is presented as the mean intensity ( ±95 % CI ) in Figure 22 . Notably , as the total cell count increased from 89 to 137 , intensity decreased from 202 . 8 AU ( ± 27 . 8 AU ) to 84 . 6 AU ( ± 8 . 9 AU ) . This was found to statistically significant when analysed using a non - parametric Kruskal Wallis ANOVA and post - hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison test ( p < 0 . 001 ) . These data suggest that seeding density effects fluorescein quantification , seen by the non - linear relationship between fluorescence and number of cells at total cell count 137 . However , this investigation was performed at very low seeding densities and exhibits a large overlap in 95 % CI of the fluorescence intensities measured at the lowest seeding densities . Further work using larger seeding densities is required to understand this non - linear relationship between cell confluency and fluorescence intensity . For the purposes of this thesis , seeding densities were kept uniform across wells and assays to allow accurate comparisons between treatments and reduce variability between experiments . Assays were carried out on cells that reached between 80 and 90 % confluency after overnight growth ; an example of this is shown in Figure 23 .

Conclusion A summary of the methods explored are shown in Table 9 . It was determined that HCA and subsequent analysis using median fluorescence intensities would be the most appropriate method for presenting such data . This is because fluorescein uptake can be quantified without additional processing or optimisation such as establishing a hyperfluorescent threshold , in contrast to fluorescence microscopy / Image J and flow cytometry . To this end , throughout this thesis the mean fluorescence of each cell is curated per treatment and is then reported as the median fluorescence intensity of the treatment cell population . In some instances , it is also presented as a fluorescence intensity histogram . Table 9 : Summary of fluorescence quantification methods .

Abstract Purpose : To investigate whether clinical hyperfluorescence of sodium fluorescein ( ‘fluorescein’ ) is affected by temperature , pH , MPS and concentration using in vitro experiments . Method : Using spectrofluorimetry , the intensity of fluorescein solutions ranging between 1x10 - 4 % and 2 % w / v at 37°C and 4°C were measured . Fluorescence intensity was similarly measured for fluorescein prepared in PBS at pH 5 , 7 9 and 11 , and in MPS Biotrue® , Bausch + Lomb ( P - PQ1 - 1107 ) , ReNu Sensitive Multi - purpose solution® , Bausch + Lomb ( P - 1107 ) , Opti - Free Replenish® , Alcon ( PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 ) , and Complete Revitalens® , AMO ( PQ1 - Alex - 1304 ) . Finally , tear film samples after addition of 1 % w / v fluorescein were collected using microcapillary tubes . The concentration of fluorescein in these tear samples was elucidated from fluorescence intensity values measured by spectrofluorimetry . Results : Fluorescein intensity retained its non - linear relationship with fluorescein at high concentrations at the temperatures investigated . However , fluorescein intensity decreased with decreasing pH but was unaffected by MPS . Measuring the intensity of fluorescein in tear samples , the concentration of fluorescein on the ocular surface rapidly decreased from initial 1 % w / v instillation to as little as 0 . 001 % w / v over a 10 minute period . Conclusions : The observed fluorescein fluorescence on the ocular surface is unlikely to be affected by variables such as temperature , pH or by interactions with residual MPS from contact lens wear . Fluorescein fluorescence however exhibits quenching at high concentrations but quickly reduces after the first minute . 99 4 . 2 . Introduction Sodium fluorescein ( FL ; C 20 H 10 Na 2 O 5 ) , more generally known as fluorescein , is a fluorescent compound with a molecular weight of 376 . 27g / mol ( Romanchuk 1982 ) . It is used in various disciplines ranging from molecular biology ( e . g . for labelling lipoproteins ) ( Petrache et al . 2016 ) to pollution research ( water tracer experiments ) and forensic science ( Seidl et al . 2016 ) . It is used in ophthalmology as an ocular surface diagnostic tool and is typically used to assess the integrity of the conjunctiva ( Eliason & Maurice 1990 ) , corneal epithelium ( Dumbleton 2002 ) and tear film ( Lievens et al . 2006 ) . Fluorescein fluoresces bright green between 500 - 600nm with an absorption wavelength that peaks in the blue region of the visible spectrum between 480 and 500nm ( Noga & Udomkusonsri 2002 ) . The optimal excitation and emission wavelengths for fluorescein are reported as 490nm and 530nm respectively ( Romanchuk 1982 ) . Fluorescein fluorescence intensity demonstrates a non - linear relationship with concentration , which is referred to as self - or concentration dependent quenching ( Romanchuk 1982 ; Ossewaarde - Van Norel et al . 2002 ; Shotton & Habeeb 1955 ; Tan et al . 2013 ) . That is , fluorescein fluorescence intensities increase with increasing fluorescein concentration until it reaches a maximum fluorescence . This point at which quenching occurs varies amongst studies ( Umberger & LaMer 1945 ; Van Duuren 1963 ) as noted by Romanchuk . With further increases in concentration , fluorescence intensity then decreases . The pH also affects the fluorescence intensity of fluorescein . This is because fluorescein exists in neutral , cationic , monoanionic and dianionic forms in solution where each species has a different spectral property ( Figure 24 ) ( Smith & Pretorius 2002 ; Sjöback et al . 1995 ) . However , the literature surrounding the relative effects of pH on fluorescein fluorescence intensity is conflicting . For example , fluorescence intensity has been reported to decrease with pH 8 and above ( Romanchuk 1982 ) . Doughty suggests that such findings may be due to artefacts of internal quenching and goes on to demonstrate that fluorescein intensity 100 decreases in acidic environments ( Doughty 2010 ) . This is consistent with the knowledge that fluorescein fluoresces in high - pH forms of the compound ( i . e . monoanionic and dianionic forms ) ( Lakowicz 2013 ) . Figure 24 : Chemical structures of fluorescein ( Sjoback et al . 1995 ) A limited number of studies have also explored the effect of temperature on fluorescence intensity . Using absorptions studies , it has been demonstrated that 0 . 0005 % w / v fluorescein remains stable at temperatures above 60°C ( Smith & Pretorius 2002 ) . In line with this , another investigation demonstrated no change in fluorescence with 0 . 1 , 0 . 01 and 0 . 001 % w / v solutions when measured after boiling under reflux ( Shotton & Habeeb 1955 ) . In contrast , temperature dependent changes in fluorescence intensity have also been demonstrated . With decreasing temperature , fluorescence emission of a 0 . 05 % w / v fluorescein solution was seen to shift towards shorter wavelengths and maximum intensity 101 was observed at room temperature ( Jenness 1929 ) . To accurately interpret clinical hyperfluorescence it is vital to understand how temperature may affect fluorescein fluorescence intensity . This also applies to cell culture models used to study clinical hyperfluorescence , where fluorescein is subjected to temperatures of 37°C for varying lengths of time ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ; Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) . In particular , the in vitro model used in our previous work and indeed the model we intend to implement in the future , requires an additional step where fluorescein treated cells are held at 4°C . With the current literature however , it is unclear to what extent temperature affects fluorescein fluorescence intensity . One type of corneal staining which is commonly observed in clinical practice is solution induced corneal staining ( SICS ) ( L . Jones et al . 2002 ; Bandamwar et al . 2010 ; Garofalo et al . 2005 ; Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ; Carnt , Willcox , et al . 2007 ) . Soft contact lens and solution combinations have been reported to produce a clinical hyperfluorescence response which has been mainly attributed to PHMB - containing MPS solutions ( Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ) . MPS / MPS components leech from certain contact lens materials at varying rates into the surrounding areas ( Tanti et al . 2011 ) , which may account for the differential hyperfluorescent responses observed . However , it is unknown to what extent MPS interaction with fluorescein affects the fluorescence intensity observed . For ocular surface evaluation , fluorescein is typically introduced onto the ocular surface as solutions prepared as 1 % or 2 % w / v , or using a filter strip impregnated with 1mg / ml fluorescein . Subsequently , ocular fluorescein staining , or ‘hyperfluorescence’ , is checked for using a slit - lamp biomicroscope enhanced with a yellow filter ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . Since topical applications of fluorescein are not performed in a precise quantitative manner , and because tear film characteristics vary between patients , the 102 concentration of fluorescein present at the ocular surface is likely to vary . After application , the concentration is likely to decrease due to dilution with the tear film and drainage from the ocular surface and little is known to what extent fluorescein concentration contributes to the intensity of ocular staining observed . Currently , only one study has investigated this . Glasgow and colleagues used fluorescence microscopy to demonstrate that fluorescein intensity increases with tear film turnover , and goes on to show that fluorescein fluorescence quenches within cellular bodies for as long as 16 minutes ( Glasgow 2016 ) . With the purpose of furthering our understanding of how fluorescein interacts with the ocular surface and the tear film , we aim to investigate the effect of temperature , pH and various MPS formulations on fluorescein fluorescence intensity as well as how the concentration of fluorescein changes on the ocular surface over time using a spectrofluorimetry technique . 103 4 . 3 . Methods and Materials Fluorescein fuorescence measurements using spectrofluorimetery 4 . 3 . 1 . In this work , the fluorescence intensity of fluorescein ( Fluorescein Sodium Salt , Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) at various concentrations , pH and temperatures using a Fluostar microplate reader ( BMG Labtech GMBH , Ortenburg , Germany ) was investigated . All solutions were aliquoted into a 96 well plate at 100µl per well and measured in triplicate unless otherwise stated . The change in fluorescein fluorescence intensity in the tear film over time was also investigated . Tear samples ( see Section 4 . 3 . 2 for further details ) were aliquoted into 384 well plates , 20µl per well . All solutions were excited at 485nm and fluorescence emission was recorded at 520nm . The gain was automatically adjusted for optimum signal amplification per plate . All fluorescence intensities are reported as the median fluorescence intensity of the replicates performed ( unless otherwise stated ) , and fluorescence intensities are reported in Arbitrary Units ( AU ) . The effect of temperature on fluroescein fluorescence 4 . 3 . 1 . 1 . The effect of temperature was first measured in the following range of fluorescein concentrations : 1x10 - 4 , 5x10 - 4 , 1x10 - 3 , 2x10 - 3 , 5x10 - 3 , 1x10 - 2 , 2x10 - 2 , 5x10 - 2 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 2 , 0 . 5 , 1 , 1 . 5 and 2 % w / v and were prepared in Dulbecco’s PBS ( PBS ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) . The fluorescence intensities of these solutions were measured at room temperature ( the laboratory temperature was measured as 22°C + / - 2°C by thermometer ) and after 40 minutes at 37°C in a humidified incubator ( Heracell 240 , ThermoFisherScientific ) , and 4°C on ice . PBS was used as a blank control and used to correct the raw fluorescence intensity values measured . The effect of pH on fluorescein fluorescence 4 . 3 . 1 . 2 . Fluorescein concentrations 0 . 001 , 0 . 002 , 0 . 02 , 0 . 1 , and 0 . 2 % w / v were prepared in PBS . Each concentration was then corrected to pH 5 , 7 , 9 and 11 using 0 . 25M HCl and 0 . 25M 104 NaOH . Respective PBS solutions were used as blank controls and used to manually correct the raw fluorescence intensity values measured in fluorescein solutions . The effect of MPS interactions on fluorescein fluorescence 4 . 3 . 1 . 3 . In a previous study by this laboratory , fluorescein was used at concentration 0 . 01 % w / v , which was a high enough concentration of fluorescein to study fluorescein uptake in cell culture ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . It has also been shown that various MPS formulations cause differential hyperfluorescence responses on the ocular surface and in cell culture . As such , the effects of 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein prepared in MPS formulations P - PQ1 - 1107 , P - 1107 , PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 , all of which are commercially manufactured to a neutral pH . The main components of these MPS formulations are shown in Table 10 . Fluorescence intensities of MPS solutions were also measured to manually correct the fluorescence intensity of fluorescein / MPS solutions . Table 10 : MPS formulations .

Tear samples from two volunteers in the research team ( student and supervisor ) were collected by a GOC registered member of the immediate research team ( a different supervisor ) , and in view of the very limited clinical work required and that both subjects gave implicit consent , and were fully informed of the nature of the work given their proximity to the project , it was decided not to formally apply to the ethics committee for approval . Collection of tear samples 4 . 3 . 2 . 1 . To determine the change in fluorescein concentration over time after a typical application of fluorescein to the ocular surface , a single drop of a 1 % w / v fluorescein Minims® ( Chauvin Pharmaceutical Ltd by Bausch + Lomb ) ( 10mg / ml ) was applied to the lower conjunctiva of two subjects . After application , a 10µl capillary tube ( Drummond MicroCaps ) was used to collect approximately 2µl of tears at 1 , 5 , and 10 minutes via capillary action ( Figure 25 ) . Samples were collected from both the right and left eye of each subject . As much care as possible was taken not to stimulate a reflex tear response by touching the conjunctival surface . Samples were then stored overnight at - 18°C . For analysis using spectrofluorimetry , tear samples were thawed at room temperature , and were dispensed from capillary tubes using the provided bulb dispenser . Figure 25 : Example of tear collection . 106 Calibration using known concentrations of fluorescein 4 . 3 . 2 . 2 . Using a 2 % w / v fluorescein Minims® ( Chauvin Pharmaceutical Ltd by Bausch + Lomb ) , fluorescein concentrations between 2 % w / v and 3 . 125x10 - 9 w / v were prepared using PBS . All fluorescein solutions were excited at 485nm and emission was recorded at 520nm . All solutions were measured in triplicate and PBS was used as blank control with which to correct the raw fluorescence intensities . A Guassian curve was subsequently fitted to these data ( R square 0 . 89 ) as seen in Figure 26 . Using JMP® statistical software , the peak , critical point , and growth rate values of the fitted curve were generated . These were 72961 , - 2 . 83 , and - 1 . 40 respectively . These values were later used in a Guassian prediction model to calculate concentrations of fluorescein from fluorescein fluorescence intensities . Figure 26 : Mean fluorescence intensity of known concentrations of fluorescein ; error bars represent standard deviation . 10 - 20 10 - 15 10 - 10 10 - 5 10 0 10 5 0 15000 30000 45000 60000 75000 log Fluorescein ( % w / v ) F L ﬂu o re s ce n ce i n t e n s i t y ( AU ) 107 Determing fluorescein concentration from tear samples 4 . 3 . 2 . 3 . Samples collected from two individuals were diluted 1 : 20 using PBS and aliquoted into wells of 384 well plates at 20µl per well . Samples were excited at 485nm and fluorescence emission was recorded at 520nm . PBS was used as a blank control . Immediately after , samples were diluted a further 1 : 20 in PBS ( 1 : 400 dilution of original sample ) and fluorescence was measured again . From measured fluorescence intensities , unknown fluorescein concentrations in collected tear samples were calculated . This was achieved using the following Gaussian prediction model where a = 72961 ( peak value ) , b = - 2 . 83 ( critical point ) and c = - 1 . 40 ( growth rate ) : 𝒇 𝔁 = 𝒂 𝐞𝐱𝐩 − 𝔁 − 𝒃 𝟐 𝟐 𝒄 𝟐 Two values are predicted using this model , one from the ascending side of the curve and the other from the descending side of the curve . In the instance of a decrease in fluorescence between the 1 : 20 and 1 : 400 diluted samples , fluorescein concentration would be calculated from the ascending side of the curve . It should follow that this is due to a decrease in fluorescein concentration . Conversely , for an increase in fluorescence , fluorescein concentration would be calculated from the descending side of the curve . This would indicate that samples were undergoing quenching . However , all fluorescence intensities measured in the tear samples decreased with additional dilution . Therefore , using the fluorescence intensities measured from tear samples diluted 1 : 20 in PBS , fluorescein concentrations were determined using the ascending side of the curve . To account for the dilution factor , the initial calculated concentration was multiplied by 20 .

All data were expressed as the median fluorescence intensity value ( and the associated lower 95 % confidence interval - upper 95 % confidence interval ) , unless otherwise stated . These data were then analysed using 2 - way ANOVA and post - hoc Tukey’s comparisons tests . Non - parametric data were analysed using Kruskal - Wallis ANOVA and post - hoc multiple Dunn’s comparison tests as stated . Statistical significance was set to * p = 0 . 05 , * * p = 0 . 01 and * * * p ≤ 0 . 001 across all tests . 109 4 . 4 . Results Temperature has no effect on fluorescein fluorescence intensities 4 . 4 . 1 . The fluorescence intensities of all concentrations tested at room temperature , 4°C and 37°C is shown in Figure 27A – C respectively . Fluorescence is reported as the median intensity ( and the associated lower 95 % CI limit – upper 95 % CI limit ) , and is expressed in Arbitrary Units ( AU ) . At room temperature , on reaching an optimum of 57046 ( 56710 - 58658 ) at 0 . 02 % w / v fluorescein , the fluorescence intensities of fluorescein demonstrated a non - linear relationship with concentration . That is , as the concentration of fluorescein increased from 0 . 02 % w / v , fluorescence intensity decreased . The overlap of 95 % confidence intervals of fluorescein concentrations 0 . 01 % and 0 . 05 % with that of 0 . 02 % fluorescein suggests that the fluorescence intensities of 0 . 01 % and 0 . 05 % are not significantly different from that exhibited by 0 . 02 % . The median fluorescence intensities of 0 . 01 % and 0 . 05 % fluorescein were 55305 ( 55298 - 57851 ) and 54604 ( 54242 - 56760 ) respectively . This indicates that the optimum fluorescence intensity is likely to be between fluorescein concentrations 0 . 01 % and 0 . 05 % w / v . The overlap of all temperatures at which fluorescence intensities were measured are shown in Figure 27 . The overlap in the confidence intervals of all fluorescein concentrations at room temperature , 4°C and 37°C seen in Figure 27D indicates temperature does not significantly affect fluorescence intensity . 110 Figure 27 : Fluorescein intensity at various concentrations and temperature ; n = 3 wells .

The same non - linear trend with fluorescein concentration and intensity was seen for the pH range investigated . The median fluorescein intensities of fluorescein at pH 5 , 7 , 9 and 11 is shown in Table 11 . At all concentrations of fluorescein investigated , fluorescence significantly decreased with an increase in acidity ( Figure 28 ) . The median fluorescence intensities of all concentrations of fluorescein measured at pH 5 significantly decreased from that measured at pH 7 ( p < 0 . 0001 in all instances ) ; median fluorescence intensities and associated confidence intervals ( CI ) are reported in Arbitrary Units : AU , and can be seen in Table 11 . For example , from pH 7 to pH 5 , the median fluorescence intensity of 0 . 0001 % fluorescein decreased from 29307 ( 29183 - 31309 ) to 1040 ( 1035 - 1082 ) . Overall increases in median fluorescence intensities were also observed from pH 7 to pH 11 at all concentrations of fluorescein tested ( p < 0 . 0001 , p < 0 . 0001 , p = 0 . 004 , p < 0 . 0001 , p < 0 . 0001 and p < 0 . 0001 for 0 . 001 % , 0 . 002 % , 0 . 01 % , 0 . 02 % , 0 . 1 % and 0 . 2 % w / v fluorescein concentrations respectively ) . These data were analysed using 2 - way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test . Together these data suggest that fluorescein intensity is quenched in weakly acidic environments . There is also statistical evidence to support that fluorescence intensity increases with increasing pH . 112 Table 11 : Median fluorescence intensities of fluorescein solutions at various pH .

Fluorescein and PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 caused a statistical but small increase in median fluorescence intensity ( 58964 ( 58954 - 58976 ) ; p = 0 . 03 ) , as shown in Figure 29 . When further analysed using a Mann - Whitney test , the difference was calculated as 2099 where the 90 % CI of the difference was 2024 - 2382 AU , which was found to be non - significant . These data show that these varying MPS formulations do not affect fluorescein intensities . Figure 29 : Fluorescence intensities of fluorescein in various MPS formulations ; n = 3 wells .

Fluorescein concentration decreases rapidly over time on the ocular surface 4 . 4 . 4 . Fluorescein fluorescence intensities decreased considerably over 10 minutes in both subjects and in both eyes ( Figure 30 ) .

Fluorescence intensities continued to decrease to 3556 AU and 2401 AU in the right and left eye respectively in the following 5 minutes .

The concentrations determined from the intensities of fluorescein in tear samples were calculated and are shown in Table 12 . The mean ( lower 95 % CI limit – upper 95 % limit ) fluorescein concentrations after 1 , 5 and 10 minutes of fluorescein application were 0 . 036 % ( - 0 . 007 - 0 . 079 % ) , 0 . 004 % ( - 0 . 003 - 0 . 011 % ) and 0 . 0001 % ( 0 . 0009 - 0 . 003 % ) respectively as seen in Figure 31 . The mean fluorescein concentration determined at 10 minutes was statistically different to that at 1 minute ( p = 0 . 0134 ) . However , no statistical difference was observed between mean fluorescein concentrations measured at 1 and 5 minutes ( p = 0 . 35 ) , and 5 and 10 minutes ( p = 0 . 61 ) when analysed by Kruskall - Wallis ANOVA and the post - hoc Dunn’s multiple comparisons test . These data show that fluorescein fluorescence , and consequently fluorescein concentration , decreases rapidly over time .

Discussion Ocular surface staining ( hyperfluorescence ) is typically observed with the application of fluorescein . Both the pH and concentration of fluorescein solutions have been implicated in affecting the intensity and interpretation of clinical hyperfluorescence ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . This study was conducted to investigate the impact of concentration , pH and temperature on the interpretation of such ocular hyperfluorescence using the laboratory technique of spectrofluorimetery . Furthermore , the concentration of fluorescein on the corneal surface at the time of observation by eye care practitioners , and the change in fluorescein concentration over time , is unknown . To investigate this , the concentration of fluorescein available at the ocular surface was elucidated from tear samples . In summary , fluorescein does not appear to be affected by the range of temperatures investigated and retains its non - linear relationship with high concentrations of fluorescein and fluorescence intensity . However , fluorescence intensity over a range of fluorescein concentration decreases significantly in association with acidic pH . These levels , however , would not normally be encountered at the ocular surface . It was also observed that 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein fluorescence intensity is unaffected by interaction with various MPS formulations . Finally , it was demonstrated that fluorescein concentration at the ocular surface rapidly reduces over a 10 minute period from 1 % w / v to as little as 0 . 0001 % w / v . An increase in temperature from room temperature ( Figure 27A ) to 37°C ( Figure 27C ) had no effect on the relative fluorescence intensities of the fluorescein solutions tested . Similarly , no effect in fluorescence intensities was observed on reducing the temperature of all fluorescein solutions from room temperature ( Figure 27A ) to 4°C ( Figure 27B ) . Given that the ocular surface temperature is 35 . 1°C ( ±0 . 64°C ) ( Abreau et al . 2016 ) , our data suggest that the intensity of corneal hyperfluorescence would be unaffected by ocular surface temperature . However , the literature surrounding the effect of temperature on 117 fluorescein intensity is sparse and conflicting . The effects observed in this study are in line with that demonstrated by Smith and Pretorius ( Smith & Pretorius 2002 ) and Shotton and Habeeb ( Shotton & Habeeb 1955 ) , both of whom show that fluorescein fluorescence intensity remains stable even at temperatures reaching as high as boiling point . Yet , it is in contrast to a study by Jenness ( Jenness 1929 ) who reports maximum intensity is observed at room temperature only . Fluorescein solutions in this latter study however , were prepared using ethyl alcohol , and thus perhaps altering the chemistry of fluorescein molecules in solution . Given that the solutions in this work and that of Smith and Pretorius , and Shotton and Habeeb were prepared in buffered saline solutions ( Smith & Pretorius 2002 ; Shotton & Habeeb 1955 ) , this may account for the difference in findings . The data presented in this study also confirm that temperature changes as part of experimental protocol in cell culture models will have no effect on the resultant fluorescein fluorescence intensities measured . In particular , the in vitro model used throughout this thesis uniquely requires holding cells at 4°C for fluorescein uptake analysis . This is due to a previous study which shows that fluorescein uptake and efflux from cells can be prevented at such a temperature ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . In cell culture , fluorescent dyes are frequently used , however in most instances the prevalence of fluorescence observed by fluorescence microscopy is sufficient . An example of this is propidium iodide ( PI ) that chelates to cellular DNA through permeable plasma membrane and effects a fluorescent amplification , which allows identification of non - viable cells ( Cummings & Schnellmann 2001 ) . In the instance of hyperfluorescence studies using in vitro models however , accurate measurement of the intensity of fluorescein fluorescence is vital . Notably , an optimum fluorescence of 57046 AU ( 56710 - 58658 AU ) was observed at 0 . 02 % w / v fluorescein after which fluorescence decreases ( Figure 27 ) . This non - linear 118 relationship between high concentrations of fluorescein and fluorescence intensity is a well known phenomenon reported in a number of studies ( Romanchuk 1982 ; Ossewaarde - Van Norel et al . 2002 ; Shotton & Habeeb 1955 ; Tan et al . 2013 ) . This is indicative of the concentration of fluorescein available at the ocular surface at the point of observation , where extremely high concentrations of fluorescein will exhibit low levels of fluorescence when observed . This loss of fluorescence is more commonly known as quenching and indeed is a common property of fluorescent compounds regularly used as an investigative tool in protein folding studies ( Basak & Chattopadhyay 2014 ; Zhuang et al . 2000 ; Spampinato et al . 2007 ; Petersson et al . 2014 ) . Fluorescein is said to undergo self - quenching ( Romanchuk 1982 ) , which involves mechanisms such as self - absorption , polymer formation and resonance energy transfer ( Glasgow 2016 ) . Romanchuk notes that this point of quenching however differs amongst studies ( Romanchuk 1982 ) with concentrations ranging from 0 . 037 % ( Van Duuren 1963 ) to 0 . 0037 % ( Umberger & LaMer 1945 ) . In this study , although the optimum fluorescence intensity was measured at 0 . 02 % , a statistical overlap in confidence intervals was measured at 0 . 01 % , 0 . 02 % and 0 . 05 % . This suggests that the concentration at which quenching begins may more broadly range between 0 . 01 % and 0 . 05 % . The reported thresholds of fluorescein concentration dependent decrease in fluorescence have also been compiled in a study by Ben Glasgow ( Glasgow 2016 ) , which range between 2 % ( Webber et al . 1987 ) and 0 . 0037 % ( Umberger & LaMer 1945 ) . The disparity of quenching thresholds in these studies may be attributed to differences in equipment and the emission / excitation wavelengths used to study fluorescein intensity , the solvent used to prepare fluorescein solutions in and , as fluorescein is also prone to light degradation ( Shotton & Habeeb 1955 ) , differences in light exposure . 119 In the present work , fluorescence intensity was shown to decrease at the weakly acidic pH 5 at all concentrations of fluorescein investigated ( Figure 28 ) . In aqueous solutions , fluorescein occurs in neutral , cationic , anionic , and dianionic forms making fluorescein a pH dependent fluorophore ( Sjöback et al . 1995 ) . We also observed that fluorescein solutions at pH 7 to 11 exhibit a small yet statistically significant increase in intensities from that exhibited at pH 5 . Although there is conflict within the literature with respects to the effects of pH on fluorescein intensity , our findings are in line with a study by Doughty 2010 that shows a decrease in fluorescence intensity at acidic pH using a 0 . 00002 % w / v fluorescein solution ( Doughty 2010 ) . This is in contrast to findings that fluorescence quenches at pH solutions of 8 and above ( Romanchuk 1982 ) . It is not clear in the literature why these findings are conflicting . Doughty suggests that there is no real evidence to support the findings that fluorescence declines with increased pH providing artefacts of internal - quenching are avoided ( Doughty 2010 ) . Doughty and colleagues further suggest that fluorescein at concentrations equal to and above 0 . 008 % w / v may confuse the interpretation of pH effects on fluorescence intensities due to its ability to undergo self - quenching ( Doughty 2010 ) . Our data strongly indicate that acidic pH decreases the fluorescence intensity of fluorescein regardless of the concentration of fluorescein tested . Nevertheless , as our work investigates the effect of pH on fluorescein at concentrations 0 . 01 % - 0 . 2 % w / v , a wider range of concentrations could be investigated in the future to explore this further . With respect to the effects of ocular pH on clinical hyperfluorescence , reports of ocular surface pH vary . For example , the pH of tear fluid has been measured as 7 . 83 ± 0 . 1 ( Chen & Maurice 1990 ) as well as 6 . 93 ± 0 . 24 ( Norn 1988 ) . Nevertheless given that ocular pH consistently remains between 6 and 8 ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) , the data in this study indicate that the resultant observed hyperfluorescence is unlikely to be affected 120 by ocular pH . It also unlikely to be affected by the slight increase in pH that occurs over the course of the day , and with age ( Coles & Jaros 1984 ) . For example , the mean pH of the ocular surface in women under and over the age of 40 has been shown to increase from 7 . 03 ± 0 . 09 to 7 . 13 ± 0 . 19 respectively ( Coles & Jaros 1984 ) . Although a study by Norn ( 1988 ) reports no significant changes in pH with age or sex , it does report that pH varies with ocular pathology ( Norn 1988 ) . For example , the pH of the conjunctival fluid was found to be more alkali in patients with lacrimal stenosis patients and keratitis ( 7 . 13 ±0 . 28 and 71 . 4 ± 0 . 28 respectively ) compared to the pH of normal persons ( 6 . 93 ± 0 . 24 ) ( Norn 1988 ) . However , given that these pH changes do not reach levels equal to or below pH 5 , it is unlikely that such pathologies would affect the intensity of fluorescein fluorescence on the ocular surface . In clinical practice , fluorescein is typically applied to the ocular surface using neutral solutions of 1 % w / v and 2 % w / v Minims® ( Bausch + Lomb ) prepared in purified water or by ophthalmic strips containing 1mg of fluorescein and wetted with saline . This work demonstrates that neutral solutions of fluorescein do not affect fluorescence intensities . It thus follows that these methods of fluorescein applications do not have a pH dependent effect on the intensity of ocular hyperfluorescence . The quenching exhibited at acidic pH does however provide vital information pertaining to the cellular localisation of fluorescein . Studies have shown that fluorescein associates with individual cells on the corneal epithelium ( Mokhtarzadeh et al . 2011 ) and using in vitro models it has been shown to localise within the cell body ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ; Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) . The pH of the cytoplasm in mammalian cell is approximately 7 . 1 – 7 . 3 ( Spitzer & Vaughan - Jones 2003 ) , however the pH varies within organelles . For example , a lysosome ( a late stage endosome ) is capable of maintaining an environment of pH ≤ 5 ( Mindell 2012 ; Canton & Grinstein 2015 ) . Given that fluorescein is thought to localise within cells ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ; 121 Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) , and that the data in this study indicate that fluorescein fluorescence intensity reduces at low pH , it is unlikely that fluorescein localises in organelles that exhibit acidic environments . It is worth noting that the emission and excitation spectra of fluorescein are dependent on the respective wavelengths used to investigate them . The maximum fluorescence of fluorescein is emitted at 530nm when excited at 480nm ( Romanchuk 1982 ) . In this work , fluorescein was excited using wavelength 485nm and fluorescence emission was captured at wavelength 520nm . Studies of absorption spectra have shown that neutral to alkaline solutions have a defined peak between 485nm and 490nm whereas slightly acidic solutions have a defined peak between 440nm and 470nm . As such either band of wavelengths can be used as an excitation wavelength for fluorescein ( Doughty 2010 ) . It has also been reported that fluorescein intensity measurements are much less sensitive to pH when measured at 440nm rather than 490nm ( Canton & Grinstein 2015 ) . Future study of fluorescein intensities should include investigation of the spectral range of emission and excitation wavelengths to fully understand the effects of pH on fluorescence intensity . It was seen that MPS formulations have little to no effect on fluorescein intensity when combined with 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein in comparison to the intensity of 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein prepared in PBS only ( Figure 29 ) . The hyperfluorescence effects of various lens / MPS combinations are well documented in a number of studies as a phenomenon known as solution induced corneal staining ( SICS ) ( Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ; Carnt , Willcox , et al . 2007 ) . A study by Tanti et al , 2011 demonstrated the MPS is released from the contact lens material and into its surrounding environment ( Tanti et al . 2011 ) . It was observed that both lens material and solution formulation impact the rate at which MPS is released ( Tanti et al . 2011 ) and it was hypothesised in this work that residual MPS may 122 interact with fluorescein to affect its fluorescence intensity in the eye . That is , those MPS associated clinically with increased hyperfluorescence may also increase the intensity of fluorescence in solution . Given that fluorescein fluorescence intensity was largely unaffected by MPS , these data suggest that hyperfluorescence on the ocular surface is not merely an effect of the fluorescein and MPS interaction . Furthermore , given that all MPS formulations are buffered to a neutral pH ( Tang et al . 1996 ; López - Alemany & Montés i Micó 1998 ) our data indicate that the pH of MPS formulations is unlikely to be a contributing factor to the ocular fluorescence observed clinically . On measuring the concentration of fluorescein collected from the tear meniscus , we observed the fluorescein concentration rapidly decreasing over time from the initial application . Within the first minute of fluorescein application , the concentration decreased from 1 % w / v to a mean concentration of 0 . 036 % w / v . In a separate experiment , we also showed that fluorescein exhibits quenching at concentrations above 0 . 02 % w / v in our initial experiments ( Figure 27 ) ( although there was no statistically significant difference in optimum fluorescence between 0 . 01 - 0 . 05 % ) , which would suggest that the fluorescein is these tear samples likely to be quenching during the first minute after application . This could not be confirmed however as the original tear samples were immediately diluted 1 : 20 to allow for subsequent intensity measurements . We further observed that fluorescein concentration continued to decrease over the next 4 to 9 minutes , exhibiting mean concentrations of 0 . 004 % and 0 . 0001 % respectively ; these concentrations did not exhibit quenching in our laboratory experiments ( Figure 27 ) . This suggests that ocular staining observed during the first minute of fluorescein instillation using a 1 % Minim may be affected by fluorescein quenching , and practitioners should be advised to wait for this period of time before assessing their patients ( Peterson et al . 2006 ) . However , eye care practitioners typically use wetted ophthalmic strips , differing to Minims® in the amount of 123 fluorescein delivered to the eye i . e . 1mg / ml versus 10 or 20 mg / ml , which would in turn affect the intensity and amount of staining observed and indeed the amount of time before quenching subsided ( Peterson et al . 2006 ) . The difference in the volumes and concentrations of fluorescein applied , by both Minims® and ophthalmic strip , and their respective effects on fluorescein concentration in the tear film using the methodology developed in this work would be interesting to investigate in the future . A study by Peterson and colleagues has indeed investigated four different fluorescein instillation methods using various models of slit - lamps and barrier filters ( Peterson et al . 2006 ) . The instillation methods tested were 1 % minim , 2 % minim , fluoret wetted with one single drop of saline solution and a fluoret wetted with saline with the excess shaken off . It was found that the 1 % minim and the wetted fluoret with the excess shaken off were the two methods that caused fluorescein to reach ‘useful levels of fluorescence’ in ~ 20 seconds , lasting for ~ 160 seconds . Using a 2 % minim , and fluoret wetted with a single drop of saline took between 2 . 2 and 2 . 7 times longer than the former methods , and lasted 1 . 2 to 1 . 4 times longer . It was thus suggested that the former methods were the most clinically appropriate forms of fluorescein instillations . These findings differ to the ones of this study in that we see quenching of our samples for the first minute after initial fluorescein application . This may be due to the differences in the methods used to study fluorescein fluorescence : in the study by Peterson , emitted fluorescence was measured in 8 - bit gray scale of images taken over 20mm 2 of the interpalpeberal aperture whereas our samples were measured from small volumes of tear film using a spectrofluorimeter . With the spectrofluorimetry method used in this work , it also has to be taken into consideration that the gain ( fluorescence signal amplification ) was automatically adjusted per plate and thus some discrepancy in fluorescence intensities measured across experiments is expected . For future analysis , the gain adjustment would be manually set across 124 experiments to allow for direct comparisons . It is also acknowledged that these conclusions are derived from a small sample size ( 2 subjects only ) and additional collections of tear samples are required to reinforce the data in this work . Clinically , the volume of fluorescein applied is subject to the clinician and method of application . In this study fluorescein was topically instilled onto the ocular surface using a single drop from a 1 % w / v Minims® . This concentration surpasses what is reported to exhibit quenching in the literature and in this work ( Doughty 2010 ; Romanchuk 1982 ) . When an ophthalmic strip is used , the volume of fluorescein applied to the ocular surface can range from 15µl to 30µl ( Mooi et al . 2017 ) . Given that the average volume of the tear meniscus and the mean tear flow is reported as 7 . 2µl ( Eter & Göbbels 2002 ) and 2µl / min ± 0 . 5 ( Goebbels 2000 ) respectively , fluorescein introduction to the ocular surface by ophthalmic strip can flood and destabilise the tear film ( Mooi et al . 2017 ) . The extent to which fluorescein floods the tear film is arguably also affected by the various patient characteristics such as the volume of the tear menisci tear flow and ocular surface pathologies such as dry eye ( Scherz et al . 1974 ; Eter & Göbbels 2002 ) . The exact volumes used in our experiments are however unknown and we did not set out to understand the tear film stability effects of fluorescein . To accurately assess the effect of fluorescein volume on fluorescein concentration , this variable should be more closely regulated and made uniform in future experiments e . g application using a micropipette . The rapid decrease in fluorescein fluorescence and concentration observed in the samples could be attributed to tear turnover . Given that blinking plays an important role in maintaining a dynamic balance by redistribution and drainage of tears ( Palakuru et al . 2008 ) , subjects were instructed to blink as normal . Although this was not measured in our subjects , on average an individual will blink 17 times per minute ( Bentivoglio et al . 1996 ) . 125 In the instance of an overloaded tear film , for example on introducing fluorescein onto the ocular surface , the blink output usually increases ( Palakuru et al . 2008 ) and the drainage rate is larger than in a normal tear film ( Zhu & Chauhan 2005 ) . This may have additionally contributed to the rapid decrease in fluorescein fluorescence observed . It is also possible that the loss of fluorescein fluorescence in the tears may also be a direct result of fluorescein uptake into the cellular body , a mechanism demonstrated in a number of studies ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ; Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) . Recently one study has investigated the change in fluorescence intensity of fluorescein on the ocular surface and reports a release of self - quenching fluorescence in tear samples over time ( Glasgow 2016 ) . Using fluorescence lifetime confocal imaging performed on tears instilled with 22mM fluorescein ( equivalent to 0 . 83 % w / v ) , the fluorescence lifetime of tears was found to be 1 . 2ns from a mean of three samples . After 5 minutes , this increased to 3 . 7ns with a 7 - fold increase in fluorescein fluorescence intensity . This increase in fluorescence intensity was attributed to a rapid tear turnover . This is in line with our findings fluorescein quenching was also released by 5 minutes , however the specific point at which quenching subsided completely is still unknown in this study . This could be determined in future by analysing tear samples collected at time points between 1 and 5 minutes . The mean fluorescence lifetimes ( ± standard deviation ) of corneal epithelial cells removed by membrane cytology were also investigated by Glasgow and were found to be 0 . 84±0 . 31ns ( n = 4 ) at 5 minutes and 1 . 4±0 . 6ns ( n = 12 ) at 16 minutes . Significantly , fluorescence remained quenched in epithelial cells beyond the time frame of clinical observation ( 16 minutes ) despite the fact that the fluorescein concentration in tears decreased beneath the quenching threshold ( Glasgow 2016 ) . This suggests that fluorescence analysis of tears is indicative of fluorescein on the ocular surface but 126 evaluation of fluorescein within epithelial cells are required to best understand the effects of fluorescein concentration on clinical hyperfluorescence . In this study , it was noted that the fluorescein concentration and fluorescence in the samples collected from the right eye of Subject 2 were considerably less than the other samples collected . This could have been due to reflex tearing , diluting the fluorescein present . Reflex tearing is usually accompanied by protective reflex lid closing ( Murube 2009 ) , although this behaviour was not obvious on collection . Methods that do not cause discomfort in individuals or require taking tear samples should thus be investigated for future experiments . An example of this is a ‘non - touch’ fluorophotometry method employed by Eter and Göbbels where fluorescence was evaluated with the aim to determine tear volume and tear secretion ( Eter & Göbbels 2002 ) . An alternative method for fluorescein quantification on the ocular surface , as described in Begley et al 2013 , is microscopy and pixel intensity quantification ( Begley et al . 2013 ) . In this instance , corneal fluorescence was evaluated using various pixel intensity distribution statistics generated from the images taken . However as fluorescein concentration depletes over time resulting in rapid loss of fluorescence intensity , fluorescence may be difficult to image . Glasgow indeed describes an insufficient signal for reliable lifetime imaging at below 20nM ( Glasgow 2016 ) . Fluorescence may also be difficult to image and quantify due to concentration induced quenching effects without a well - established quenching threshold . Another possible explanation for this stark difference is that that the volumes of fluorescein added to subjects may not have been not uniform , causing varied fluorescein fluorescence measured from the tear samples . Future work in investigating the physiochemical properties of fluorescein would be to next study using an in vivo model . A typically less invasive alternative to in vivo animal studies 127 however are 3D in vitro models of the human corneal epithelium ( HCE ) ; the use of HCE models do not compromise the overall cellular morphology of the corneal epithelium . A study by Meloni and colleagues use such a model ( purchased from SkinEthic® Laboratories [ Nice , France ] ) to study the early signs of ocular irritation in response to various tear substitutes ; it allowed Meloni and colleagues to study the cellular viability ( using MTT tests ) , occludin expression , and perform histology ( Meloni et al . 2009 ) . Nevertheless , the lacrimal gland processes were missing from this model , and as such , washing - out or diluting of solutions on the model did not occur ( Meloni et al . 2009 ) . It is however interesting to note that an in vitro eye model has been developed to replicate blink and tear turnover rate and is currently used in conjunction with contact lens testing ( Phan et al , 2016a ; Phan et al , 2016b ) , and thus such models / equipment and protocols could be incorporated into 3D cell culture work . In the context of the work in this thesis , as fluorescein fluorescence intensity is affected by its concentration / dilution by tears , HCE models such as this would be have to be modified to include tear turnover . 4 . 6 . Conclusions In summary , this work has demonstrated that pH and temperature do not affect fluorescein fluorescence in solution . It was also found that MPS interactions with fluorescein solutions do not alter fluorescein fluorescence as typically seen with the SICS phenomenon . Fluorescein concentrations between 0 . 01 - 0 . 05 % w / v resulted in maximum fluorescence whilst those above 0 . 05 % w / v caused quenching . Quantification of fluorescein concentration at the ocular surface in two subjects revealed that the concentration decreased rapidly over time . The effect of quenching diminished after 1 minute following fluorescein application using a 1 % Minim . 128 Chapter 5 Cellular fluorescein hyperfluorescence is dynamin - dependent and is increased by Tetronic 1107 treatment 129 5 . 1 . Abstract Purpose : The aim of this study was to investigate the biological mechanisms underpinning fluorescein ( ‘sodium fluorescein’ ) uptake in cell culture , and to identify the hyperfluorescence - inducing components in multi - purpose solution ( MPS ) formulations . Methods : Differential fluorescein uptake and cell viability ( by propidium iodide staining ) was observed using fluorescence microscopy in murine fibroblasts ( L929 cells ) treated with MPS formulations known to clinically increase hyperfluorescence : Biotrue® by Bausch + Lomb ( P - PQ1 - 1107 ) , ReNu Sensitive Multi - purpose solution® by Bausch + Lomb ( P - 1107 ) , and those observed to exhibit limited hyperfluorescence : Opti - Free Replenish® by Alcon ( PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 ) , and Complete Revitalens® by AMO ( PQ1 - Alex - 904 ) . Fluorescein uptake was quantified using high content analysis ( HCA ) and cell viability was additionally investigated using MTT assays in L929 cells and human corneal ( HC ) cells . Apoptosis was also investigated in all MPS treated L929 cells using apoptosis marker Caspase - 3 and confocal microscopy . To further investigate the mechanism underpinning fluorescein internalisation , P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 treated L929 and HC cells were treated with dynasore , a reversible inhibitor of GTP - ase dynamin , a protein implicated in a number of endocytic pathways ; fluorescein uptake and cell viability were then studied . Fluorescein uptake in L929 and HC cells were also quantified after treatment with Tetronic 1107 , a non - ionic surfactant present in hyperfluorescence inducing MPS formulation , and Triton X - 100 , a similarly non - ionic surfactant compound typically used in the laboratory . Results : Using this in vitro model , an increase in hyperfluorescence was quantified in P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 treated cells , which correlated with the increase in fluorescein uptake observed by fluorescence microscopy in L929 cells . Similarly , a limited uptake of fluorescein was also quantified by HCA as was observed with fluorescence microscopy 130 after treatment with PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 . The same fluorescein uptake profiles were also observed in HC cells . Propidium iodide ( PI ) uptake in PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 treated cells suggested necrotic cells do not mediate fluorescein uptake , which was later confirmed using MTT assays , and in BKC ( necrosis inducer ) treated cells . The data also indicates that fluorescein uptake is likely to be unrelated to apoptosis . On investigating fluorescein internalisation , dynasore treated cells reduced fluorescein uptake in otherwise MPS induced hyperfluorescent cells with no detrimental effect on cell viability , indicating fluorescein uptake is in part dynamin - dependent in both cell lines . Finally , 1 % w / v Tetronic 1107 treated cells ( the concentration of surfactant found in P - PQ - 1107 and P - 1107 ) caused an increase in fluorescein uptake with no detrimental effect on cell viability . Conclusions : To conclude , increased hyperfluorescence is mediated by active , viable cells only and is unlikely related to apoptosis . These data also indicate fluorescein uptake is an internalisation process mediated , in part , by GTP - ase dynamin . Finally , the surfactant component of hyperfluorescence inducing MPS Tetronic 1107 at 1 % ( w / v ) was observed to cause increased fluorescein uptake , which was in some instances similar to that typically observed with hyperfluorescence inducing MPS . 131 5 . 2 . Introduction Fluorescein is frequently used as a fluorescent marker in cell biological research , and also as an ocular surface diagnostic tool in human and veterinary ophthalmology . In particular , fluorescein is used to investigate the integrity of the corneal and conjunctival surfaces and when hyperfluorescence ( staining ) is observed , it is commonly assumed to indicate dead or damaged cells ( G . Wilson et al . 1995 ; Tabery 1992 ; Tabery 2003a ; Tabery 2003b ) . However , very few studies have investigated the cellular basis for this hyperfluorescent staining , and in fact it may reflect the occurrence of one ( or more ) physiological changes in corneal tissues , which may be unrelated to cellular damage ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ; Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . Corneal staining is typically observed with pre - existing ocular disease such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca ( dry eye ) ( Jie et al . 2008 ; McMonnies 2007 ) , following trauma such as alkali burns or corneal abrasions ( Wipperman & Dorsch 2013 ; Fante & Trobe 2014 ; S . A . Wilson & Last 2004 ; Smally et al . 1992 ; Scarlett & Gee 2007 ) , contact lens wear , and with the use of certain contact lens care solutions ( Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ; Carnt , Willcox , et al . 2007 ) . Many diverse mechanisms have been proposed for ocular surface fluorescein hyperfluorescence , and it remains unclear whether increased fluorescein intensity is localised on the corneal surface , within or between epithelial cells , or within the stroma . One hypothesis is that fluorescein accumulates in a depression in the epithelial tissues , resulting in a local increase in the thickness of the tear film that is then observed as increased fluorescence ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . Another hypothesis is that an increase in tissue permeability caused by structurally compromised tight junctions allows for extracellular fluorescein movement through the epithelium which is then observed as an increase in fluorescence ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . It has further been suggested that fluorescein can be internalised by epithelial cells 132 ( Mokhtarzadeh et al . 2011 ; Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) , and it is the increased localisation of fluorescein within the cell body that is observed as hyperfluorescence . In recent years many reports have described the phenomenon of solution induced corneal staining ( SICS ) associated with soft contact lens wear ( Efron 2013 ; L . Jones et al . 2002 ; Bandamwar et al . 2010 ; Garofalo et al . 2005 ; Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ; Carnt , Willcox , et al . 2007 ; Carnt et al . 2009 ; Carnt , Jalbert , et al . 2007 ; Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ; K . W . Ward 2008 ) . SICS presents as superficial corneal and conjunctival staining , which is consistent with single cells or clusters of cells appearing brighter than adjacent cells ( Maldonado - Codina et al . 2013 ) . The intensity is greatest 1 - 2 hours following exposure to certain soft lens / multipurpose solution ( MPS ) combinations ( Bandamwar et al . 2010 ; Garofalo et al . 2005 ; Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ; Lebow & Schachet 2003 ) . An MPS is a single step formulation used to both clean and disinfect re - useable contact lenses between wearing periods . These solutions characteristically contain a surfactant cleaner ( e . g . a poloxamine block copolymer such as Tetronic 1107 ) , a biocide such as Polyhexamethylene biguanide ( PHMB ) or Polyquaternium - 1 ( PQ1 ) and a buffering agent ( e . g . citrate , phosphate , or borate ) . Clinical and laboratory studies on SICS have explored several potential mechanisms . It has been suggested that SICS is the result of MPS - induced cellular damage and a number of in vitro , studies have shown certain lens and / or MPS induce notable decreases in cellular viability , and in some cases necrosis , ( Choy et al . 2012 ; Wright & Mowrey - McKee 2005 ; Dutot et al . 2008 ; Dutot et al . 2010 ) , although there is little evidence demonstrating these links between toxicity and fluorescein hyperfluorescence . More broadly , although the term ‘toxic’ has been readily used to describe the SICS phenomenon , it is not clear if any cellular damage has occurred when hyperfluorescence is observed in vivo . For example , exposure to PHMB - based MPS , most commonly associated with SICS ( Andrasko & Ryen 133 2008 ; Carnt , Willcox , et al . 2007 ; L . Jones et al . 2002 ; Lebow & Schachet 2003 ; Pritchard et al . 2003 ; Garofalo et al . 2005 ) , resulted in no histological change when observed using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) ( Tchao et al . 2002 ) . Conversely , after exposure to PQ - 1 - based MPS , typically not associated with increased hyperfluorescence , both membrane disruption and increased membrane permeability was observed ( Tchao et al . 2002 ) . It has been suggested that SICS is a benign phenomenon which is not indicative of dead or damaged cells ( Bright et al . 2012 ) . One possibility is that PHMB mediates the association of fluorescein with the corneal epithelial surface , and this radically - different explanation is known as the ‘preservative - associated transient hyperfluorescence’ ( PATH ) hypothesis ( Bright et al . 2012 ) . It is noteworthy that studies of MPS - associated hyperfluorescence predominately focus on the effects of biocides , and there is little exploration of the potential hyperfluorescence - inducing effects of any other MPS component such as surfactants . Clinical studies of combined contact lens and MPS induced hyperfluorescence have been summarised in the Andrasko Corneal Staining Grid ( Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ) ( accessible at www . staininggrid . com ) . Briefly , MPS formulations were tested in conjunction with contact lenses of varying materials , and the performance of each combination was assessed for corneal staining after 2 hours of lens wear . PHMB - based MPS in particular were found to be associated with increased corneal staining . Given the clinical absence of hyperfluorescence with some lens / solution combinations but the marked response with others , the successful in vitro modelling of SICS potentially provides a useful tool to investigate a ) the biological basis of the interaction of epithelial cells with fluorescein and b ) a basic understanding of the clinical SICS response . A convincing laboratory model of SICS should exhibit similar hyperfluorescence responses to those observed clinically . This laboratory has previously developed such models 134 utilising multiple cell types and has shown that fluorescein is taken into the cell resulting in hyperfluorescence in response to treatment with a single MPS ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . This previous work also demonstrated that internalisation and efflux of fluorescein by cells are both energy dependent processes ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . The present study aimed to validate the cell culture model of SICS by confirming that the presence or absence of hyperfluorescence associated with clinical use of four different MPS is replicated in our model system . Additionally , it was an aim to clarify the likely mechanisms underlying SICS by investigating whether any hyperfluorescence caused by these solutions is associated with increased apoptosis or endocytosis . There are numerous endocytic pathways that involve dynamin ( a GTPase protein ) and the actin cytoskeleton . These components in particular are integral to the invagination of the plasma membrane and the movement of endocytic vesicles ( that contain extracellular materials ) into the cell ( Jeng & Welch 2001 ) . Endocytosis is an energy dependent process that has yet to be explored as a mechanism of fluorescein uptake into cells . Dynamin is a GTPase implicated in several endocytic pathways , and has also been linked to actin cytoskeleton activity ( Jeng & Welch 2001 ; Doherty & McMahon 2009 ) . Both processes are integral to vesicle formation and uptake of extracellular materials into the cell body . Dynasore is a well - known inhibitor of dynamin ( Tsai et al . 2009 ; Barrias et al . 2010 ; Yamada et al . 2009 ; Macia et al . 2006 ) , and so this was used to investigate dynamin - associated endocytic pathways as a potential mechanism for fluorescein uptake . Finally , it was also an aim identify the component ( s ) of MPS responsible for inducing hyperfluorescence . 135 5 . 3 . Materials and Methods Cell culture 5 . 3 . 1 . Human corneal ( HC ) cells were obtained from human corneal explants provided by Manchester Eye Bank . Briefly , HC cells were grown from segmented sections of corneal explants in wells pre - coated for 1 hour with 0 . 01 % calf - skin type I collagen ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) prepared in Dulbecco’s PBS ( PBS ) ( ThermoFisher , UK ) . This protocol was adapted from Kahn et al , 1993 ( Kahn et al . 1993 ) . Murine fibroblasts ( L929 cells ) ( ECACC No . 85011425 , UK ) and HC cells were maintained at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) containing 4500mg - L glucose ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) supplemented with 10 % v / v fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) and 4mM L - glutamine ( Gibco by Life Technologies , UK ) , referred to hereafter as ‘growth medium’ . For HC cells , all tissue culture flasks and plates had been pre - coated for 1 hour with 0 . 01 % calf - skin type I collagen in PBS . Cells were maintained until they had grown to approximately 80 % confluency , before rinsing with PBS and treating with 0 . 25 % trypsin - EDTA ( Life Technologies , UK ) for L929 cells or 0 . 05 % trypsin - EDTA in PBS for HC cells . After cell detachment , trypsin - EDTA was neutralised by addition of equal volumes of growth medium . For experiments , cells were seeded in 24 - well plates ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) at a density of 1x10 5 cell / well for fluorescence microscopy , or in 96 well plates ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) at 2 . 5x10 4 cells / well for high content analysis ( HCA ) or cell viability experiments , and in CELLview TM glass bottom dishes ( Greiner Bio - One , UK ) at 5x10 4 cells per chamber for confocal microscopy . In all cases , cells were used in experiments after overnight growth . Cell treatment with MPS , BKC , or MPS components 5 . 3 . 2 . MPS formulations were obtained commercially , based on their differential association with fluorescein hyperfluorescence clinically , and their main biocide and surfactants components ( shown in Table 1 ) . MPS known to cause hyperfluorescence were : ReNu 136 Sensitive Multi - purpose solution® and Biotrue® ( Bausch + Lomb ) referred to as P - 1107 and P - PQ1 - 1107 respectively . MPS investigated which do not cause hyperfluorescence were : Complete RevitaLens® ( AMO ) referred to as PQ1 - Alex - 904 , and Opti - Free Replenish® ( Alcon ) referred to as PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 . In later experiments a 10 % w / v solution of Tetronic 1107 ( BASF , New Jersey , USA ) was prepared in borate buffer ( 0 . 6 % boric acid , 0 . 1 % borax ) ; borate buffer was used as this is the buffering system in use in P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 formulations . Solution of 10 % w / v Tetronic 1107 was then further diluted to 1 % ( the concentration used in those MPS ) and also 0 . 1 % in borate buffer prior to addition to cells . A 1 . 25 % solution of Triton X - 100 ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) was diluted in PBS to produce 0 . 125 % , 0 . 0125 % , and 0 . 00125 % solutions . Finally 0 . 01 % w / v benzalkonium chloride ( BKC ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) was prepared in PBS . For cell treatment after overnight growth , media was removed from each well and the various MPS , Tetronic 1107 or Triton X - 100 solutions were added , before incubation for 2 hours at 37°C . BKC solution was added for 10 minutes at 37°C ( a sufficient exposure time to induce necrosis in all cells ) . Effects were compared with cells treated with growth medium alone , hereafter referred to as ‘media control’ , or an appropriate control . Fluorescein staining 5 . 3 . 3 . After treatment , test formulations were aspirated and cells were incubated with 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein ( Fluorescein Sodium Salt , Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) in PBS for 10 minutes at 37°C . Hoecsht 33342 , at a final concentration of 0 . 2mg / ml in PBS , was added to each well to enable total cell numbers to be assessed ( necessary for subsequent fluorescence intensity analysis ) . For some experiments , propidium iodide ( PI ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) , at a final concentration of 0 . 01mg / ml in PBS , was also incubated with the cells for 10 minutes to identify lysed cells . On removal from the incubator , plates were kept on ice , and the cells were washed three times with cold PBS . This is because we had previously shown that use of cold temperature for observation of treated cells was necessary to prevent efflux of 137 fluorescein over time ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . Cells remained on ice until microscopy or high content analysis ( HCA ) , with this being carried out within 5 minutes after fluorescein incubation . Metabolic activity assays ( MTT ) 5 . 3 . 4 . HC or L929 cells growing in 96 well plates were treated with test formulations , before aspiration and replacement with growth medium containing 0 . 5mg / ml thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) , and subsequent incubation for 2 hours at 37°C . Growth medium containing MTT was then aspirated , and insoluble formazan was solubilised using 100µl of DMSO ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) , followed by assessment of absorbance at 555nm . Caspase - 3 immunofluorescence 5 . 3 . 5 . L929 cells growing in 24 well plates were treated with MPS and fluorescein as described above . Cells were then stained using an antibody for cleaved Caspase - 3 ( New England BioLabs , UK ) , following the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , cells were fixed for 10 minutes at room temperature in 3 . 7 % w / v paraformaldehyde ( Alfa Aesar , UK ) . A blocking buffer , ( 5 % Normal Goat Serum ( New England BioLabs , 5425 ) and 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) in PBS ) was then applied for 60 minutes at 37°C . The blocking buffer was aspirated and the primary antibody was diluted 1 : 400 in 1 % BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) supplemented with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 in PBS ( an antibody dilution buffer ) , and applied overnight at 4°C . Plates were washed three times by adding 1ml PBS and incubating for 5 minutes before the addition of Alex Fluor 594 conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG secondary antibody ( ThermoFisher Scientific , UK ) ( diluted 1 : 250 in antibody dilution buffer ) , and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 2 hours . Each well was washed by aspiration , and addition of a further 1ml PBS for 5 minutes , before observation using widefield fluorescent microscopy ( Olympus IX83 ) . 138 Evaluation of dynamin - associated fluorescein staining 5 . 3 . 6 . Cells in 96 - well plates were treated with MPS formulations or media for 2 hours and then rinsed with serum free growth medium before addition of 160µM dynasore monohydrate ( dynasore ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) for a further 30 minutes . This concentration and time of dynasore treatment was determined after fluorescence microscopy analysis of pHRodo® Red conjugated transferrin pHRodo ( 25µg / ml prepared in Live Cell Imaging Solution ; both acquired from Molecular Probes® by Life Technologies , UK ) uptake in L929 cells treated with 40µM , 80µM and 160µM of dynasore for 30 minutes , 1 hour and 2 hours ( data not shown ) . The dynasore stock solution contained 0 . 1 % DMSO , and a vehicle control was used in which cells were treated with serum free growth medium containing 0 . 1 % DMSO . After aspiration , cells were incubated with 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein and washed as stated above . Fluorescein uptake was quantified using HCA . High content analysis ( HCA ) 5 . 3 . 7 . Quantification of fluorescein uptake was carried out using the Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS Reader , and the accompanying HCS Studio Cell 2 . 0 Analysis Software . Cells were visualised using the ArrayScan ™ automated Observer Z1 inverted microscope ( Zeiss ) with transmitted light and fluorescence using an XF53 filter wheel . High - resolution images were taken using a CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Orca ER ) with a 5x / 0 . 25 Fluar objective . Images of fluorescein stained cells were taken using 0 . 033 seconds exposure for all experiments . One field of view was taken per well , with multiple wells per treatment as stated were tested to enable quick data collection . Samples were maintained at 4°C during imaging to limit fluorescein loss from cells . Using a built in bioapplication , and adjusting for cell type , the mean pixel intensity of each cell was measured per treatment . The median fluorescence intensity value was reported in Arbitrary Units ( AU ) ( median lower 95 % CI limit - upper 95 % CI limit ) . 139 Fluorescence and Confocal microscopy 5 . 3 . 8 . Widefield fluorescent images of L929 cells were collected on an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope using a 10x / 0 . 3 UPlanFL N , or 20x / 0 . 45 LUC PlanFL N ( Ph1 ) objective and captured using an Orca ER camera ( Hamamatsu ) through CellSens software ( Olympus ) . Confocal images of L929 and HC were collected on a Leica TCS SP8 AOBS inverted gSTED microscope using a 40x / 1 . 3 HC PL APO ( Oil ) objective . The confocal settings were set as pinhole 1 . 12 airy unit and scan speed 400Hz unidirectional . Images were processed using ImageJ software . Statistical analysis 5 . 3 . 9 . All fluorescein fluorescence intensity data are presented as the median intensity values , and error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) . Metabolic activities are presented as a percentage of the appropriate control and the associated 95 % CI , calculated using the median metabolic activity values . In all instances , data were analysed using non - parametric Kruskal - Wallis ANOVA and Dunn’s multiple comparison post - hoc tests . The level of statistical analysis was set to * p = 0 . 05 , * * p = 0 . 01 and * * * p ≤ 0 . 001 for all tests . Table 13 : MPS formulations .

Results Fluorescein hyperfluorescence in vitro is increased by the same MPS formulations 5 . 4 . 1 . associated with SICS L929 cells treated for 2 hours with P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 ( MPS formulations both associated with hyperfluorescence clinically ) showed increased fluorescein uptake compared to the media control , and minimal evidence of PI staining ( confirming a lack of cell death ) . Those commercial formulations associated clinically low fluorescein hyperfluorescence ( PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 ) also caused low fluorescein hyperfluorescence in our in vitro model , although increased PI staining was observed after treatment with these two solutions , suggesting increased necrosis ( Figure 32A ) . In order to obtain quantitative data , fluorescein uptake was quantified using HCA in L929 cells and HC cells . It was found that fluorescein intensity was not normally distributed and so median values were calculated using lower 95 % CI – upper 95 % CI . The median fluorescence intensities after treatment of L929 cells with P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 were significantly greater than those for media control ( 84 . 5 ( 78 . 2 - 92 . 3 ) , 119 . 1 ( 111 . 1 - 126 . 5 ) and 61 . 7 ( 50 . 1 - 71 . 8 ) respectively ) . However after treatment with PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 the fluorescence intensity was significantly less than that for media control ( 10 . 2 ( 9 . 5 - 10 . 8 ) and 0 ( 0 - 0 ) ( Figure 32B ) . Similar results were obtained for HC cells . The fluorescence intensities in HC cells after P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 treatment significantly increased when compared to media control ( 655 ( 641 . 3 - 676 . 5 ) , 509 . 9 ( 492 . 8 - 524 . 6 ) and 187 . 5 ( 180 . 8 - 192 ) respectively ) whereas those treated with PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 exhibited a decrease in fluorescence intensities ( 78 ( 73 . 2 - 85 . 1 ) and 66 ( 62 . 4 - 71 . 2 ) respectively ) ( Figure 32C ) .

We next examined whether metabolic activity might correlate with increased fluorescein uptake . In initial control experiments , it was confirmed that treatment with cytotoxic levels of BKC results in necrosis ( as confirmed by PI staining ) and minimal fluorescein staining in L929 cells ( Figure 33A ) . In subsequent MTT assays BKC treated L929 cells showed just 4 . 4 % ( 4 - 6 . 6 % ) metabolic activity compared to media control ( p = 0 . 005 ) . Similarly PQ1 - Alex - 904 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 + FL treated cells showed 6 . 4 % ( 5 - 7 . 7 % ) activity of the control ( p < 0 . 00 1 ) . PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 + FL also underwent a decrease in metabolic activity but this was not statistically different from media control . N o significant c hange in metabolic activity relative to control for treatment with fluorescein alone and after P - PQ1 - 1107 or P - 1107 treatment was observed ( Figure 33 B ) . Consistent with data for L929 cells , metabolic activity in HC cells decreas ed significantly after BKC treatment to 8 . 6 % ( 4 . 5 - 9 . 6 % ) of control ; ( p = 0 . 003 ) . PQ1 - Alex - 904 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 + FL decreased to 9 . 6 % ( 8 . 9 - 11 . 1 % ) and 4 . 7 % ( 4 . 4 - 7 . 3 % ) of control respectively ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) . PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 ( 13 . 7 % ( 11 . 5 - 15 . 1 % ) ; p = 0 . 005 ) and PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 + FL decreased to 13 . 7 ( 11 . 5 - 15 . 1 % ) and 20 . 8 % ( 14 . 1 - 12 . 61 % ) of control respectively ( p ≤ 0 . 03 ) . No significant change in metabolic activity was seen after treatment with fluorescein alone , or after treatment with P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 ( Figure 33 C ) . 143 Figure 33 : ( A ) Fluorescein and propidium iodide staining after BKC treatment in L929 cells ; n = 3 wells .

L929 cells and HC cells treated with media control and MPS associated with increased hyperfluorescence , P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 , were examined by confocal microscopy . Membrane blebbing ( which can be a hallmark of apoptosis ) was observed in P - PQ1 - 1107 treated cells only . Given that membrane blebbing was not observed with media control or P - 1107 treated cells , these data suggest apoptosis may be unrelated to hyperfluorescence ( Figure 34A ) . To examine further , L929 cells treated with various MPS formulations and with fluorescein were examined for apoptosis , by immunostaining for cleaved caspase - 3 , a downstream protease utilised in the apoptosis pathway ( J . Li & Yuan 2008 ; McIlwain et al . 2013 ) . With all MPS treatments , no evidence of caspase - 3 staining above that already found for media control was evident ( Figure 34B ) , confirming that fluorescein hyperfluorescence appears to be unrelated to apoptosis . 145 Figure 34 : ( A ) Confocal microscopy images of L929 and HC cells treated with P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 and stained with 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein .

Dynasore treatment resulted in decreased fluorescein intensity both for control cells and for all hyperfluorescence - inducing MPS formulations ( Figure 35A ) . The median fluorescence intensities ( and associated confidence intervals ) decreased in media control , P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 treated cells from 297 . 6 ( 294 . 5 - 300 . 1 ) , 477 ( 471 . 7 - 481 . 8 ) and 399 . 2 ( 395 - 404 ) to 247 . 6 ( 245 . 2 - 250 . 2 ) , 282 . 5 ( 279 . 8 - 285 . 1 ) and 126 . 5 ( 123 . 8 - 128 . 9 ) following dynasore treatment , respectively . The same effect was also seen in HC cells , with a significant decrease in dynasore treated cells compared to no dynasore treatment ( Figure 35B ) . Cells under the same conditions were also analysed for metabolic activity by MTT assays . There was no significant change in metabolic activity in dynasore treated cells relative to media + FL treatment across both L929 and HC cells ( Figure 35C and D respectively ) . Together these data suggest MPS - related hyperfluorescence involves dynamin - dependent pathways . 147 Figure 35 : Dynamin inhibition in ( A ) L929 cells ; n = 8 wells ; typical data shown .

As the two solutions causing increased fluorescein hyperfluorescence were the only ones to contain Tetronic 1107 , whether this surfactant alone might cause hyperfluorescence was tested . This was tested above and below its critical micelle concentration ( CMC ) ( CMC = 0 . 49 % w / v at pH 7 . 4 ( Chiappetta et al . 2008 ) ) . L929 and HC cells were treated with Tetronic 1107 at 0 . 1 % , 1 % and 10 % w / v , prepared in borate buffer , for 2 hours before fluorescein treatment . Fluorescein fluorescence intensity in L929 cells increased with 0 . 1 % , 1 % and 10 % w / v Tetronic 1107 compared to both borate buffer ( carrier control ) and media control ( p < 0 . 0001 in all instances ) ( Figure 36A ) . There was a small but significant increase in fluorescence intensity after 1 % Tetronic 1107 treatment to 642 . 5 ( 632 . 5 - 653 . 3 ) compared to cells treated with P - PQ1 - 1107 at 604 . 5 ( 584 - 621 . 4 ) ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . As expected the median fluorescence intensity decreased with PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 treatments when compared to both borate buffer and media control ( p < 0 . 0001 in all instances ) . In HC cells , 1 % w / v Tetronic 1107 treatment significantly increased the median fluorescein fluorescence intensity to 227 . 3 ( 215 . 2 - 238 . 8 ) as compared with borate buffer ( carrier control ) treatment and media control , which resulted in fluorescence intensity of 73 . 8 ( 60 . 8 - 87 . 5 ) and 0 ( 0 - 0 ) respectively ( p < 0 . 0001 in both instances ) . The mean fluorescence ( lower 95 % CI – upper 95 % CI ) measured for media control was 6 . 24 ( 4 . 8 - 7 . 6 ) , indicating fluorescein uptake did occur in media control treated cells . The fluorescence intensity found for 1 % w / v Tetronic 1107 also significantly exceeded the intensity measured for PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 , PQ1 - Alex - 904 , 0 . 1 % w / v and 10 % w / v Tetronic 1107 , however were less than the median fluorescence intensity values found for P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 ( p < 0 . 0001 in all instances ) ( Figure 36B ) . 149 The effect on fluorescein fluorescence of treatment with the generic surfactant Triton X - 100 was also measured in HC cells . The CMC for Triton X - 100 occurs between 0 . 2mM and 0 . 9mM , which is equivalent to 0 . 125 to 0 . 563 % ( v / v ) . Fluorescein fluorescence intensities after 1 . 25 % , 0 . 125 % and 0 . 0125 % Triton X - 100 treatment were significantly less that that found after PBS ( carrier control ) treatment of HC cells ; ( p < 0 . 0001 in all instances ) . The fluorescence intensity after 0 . 00125 % Triton X - 100 treatment of HC cells was comparable to that of PBS treated cells ( p > 0 . 0009 ) , indicating any effect of hyperfluorescence observed after 0 . 00125 % Triton X - 100 treatment was a result of the carrier control . Treatment with 0 . 00125 % and 0 . 0125 % Triton X - 100 significantly increased fluorescein fluorescence intensity to 307 . 8 ( 298 - 313 . 5 ) and 244 . 6 ( 240 . 8 - 249 . 6 ) respectively relative to media control ( 212 . 8 ( 207 . 9 - 216 . 5 ) ) whereas after treatment with 0 . 125 % and 1 . 25 % Triton X - 100 ( concentrations above its CMC ) a decrease in fluorescein fluorescence intensity to 32 . 5 ( 31 . 2 - 34 . 8 ) and 22 . 6 ( 22 . 4 - 22 . 8 ) respectively was observed ( p < 0 . 0001 in all instances ) . Together these data suggest that increased fluorescein uptake associated with P - PQ - 1107 and P - 1107 may be caused by Tetronic 1107 , in particular when formulated at 1 % ( w / v ) , and that this effect may be found for other surfactants . Evaluation of metabolic activity in surfactant treated cells 5 . 4 . 6 . Finally , the effects of Tetronic 1107 and Triton X - 100 on cell metabolic activity was examined to confirm that the effect of surfactants was not mediated simply through increased cellular activity . It was found that 0 . 1 % , 1 % , and 10 % w / v Tetronic 1107 treatments followed by 0 . 01 % fluorescein resulted in no significant change in metabolic activity compared to media control for L929 cells ( p > 0 . 9999 in all instances ) . Similarly , no significant change in metabolic activity relative to media control was observed in HC cells ( p ≥ 0 . 6 ) ( Figure 36D and E respectively ) . 150 The effect of Triton X - 100 on HC cell metabolic activity was also measured . N o significant change in metabolic activity relative to media control was observed with fluorescein only , PBS + FL , 0 . 00125 % and 0 . 0125 % Triton X - 100 + FL treatments ( p > 0 . 999 in all instances ) . However , with 0 . 125 % and 1 . 25 % Triton X - 100 treatment metabolic activity significantly decreased compared to media control to 1 . 9 % ( 1 . 7 - 2 % ) and 1 . 5 ( 1 . 2 - 2 % ) respectively ; ( p = 0 . 01 and p = 0 . 003 respectively ) ( Figure 36E ) . Given that Triton X - 100 at 0 . 125 % and 1 . 25 % demonstrated a significant decrease in both metabolic activity and in fluorescence uptake , and the converse was shown true at concentrations 0 . 00125 % and 0 . 0125 % , this further confirms earlier findings suggesting only metabolically active cells display increased hyperfluorescence . 151 Figure 36 : ( A ) Role of MPS surfactants in increasing fluorescein uptake in L929 and ( B ) HC cells quantified by HCA ; n = 6 , n = 5 for L929 with P - PQ1 - 1107 and HC with 10 % Tetronic 1107 .

Discussion An in vitro model to investigate the biological basis for fluorescein hyperfluorescence on the corneal surface , using both murine fibroblasts and human corneal ( HC ) cells has been developed in this work . This approach made use of the well - characterised clinical effects of different contact lens MPS on fluorescein hyperfluorescence ( known as SICS ) . Several studies previously proposed that fluorescein hyperfluorescence involves the direct uptake of fluorescein into corneal epithelial cells ( Mokhtarzadeh et al . 2011 ; Kuwayama et al . 2002 ; Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) and this mechanism was the focus of this current work . Previously in this laboratory , it was shown that fluorescein uptake into mammalian cells was temperature dependent , and increased after exposure to ReNu Multiplus® MPS , which contains the surfactant Tetronic 1107 ( and twice the concentration of PHMB ) as in P - 1107 ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . In the present study , the effects of MPS known to increase or decrease hyperfluorescence clinically , and the biological basis for fluorescein uptake were examined . Notably fluorescein quantification was performed in the present study using a high content analysis ( HCA ) platform which measures the level of fluorescence of each cell . Only one other study has attempted to quantify fluorescein levels in cultured cells ( in that case using conventional fluorescence microscopy ) ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) . It was seen that the MPS formulations which are known to increase hyperfluorescence on the ocular surface ( P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 ) ( L . Jones et al . 2002 ; Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ; Tilia et al . 2012 ) both cause increased fluorescein hyperfluorescence in L929 fibroblasts and HC cells . Conversely PQ1 - Alex - 904 or PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 resulted in little or no fluorescein staining , once again in line with the clinically observed effects of these solutions ( Kilvington et al . 2010 ; Tilia et al . 2012 ) . It is possible that the interaction of a contact lens material itself with the MPS ( and potentially with the corneal epithelium ) may contribute to the hyperfluorescence observed clinically . However this finding that the clinically observed effects of these four MPS on hyperfluorescence can be reproduced in a 153 simple cell culture model without the presence of a lens material , suggests that SICS may primarily reflect the biochemical effects of the MPS . Different contact lens materials may additionally moderate levels of the MPS components able to reach the corneal surface . It was further confirmed quantitatively that non - viable necrotic cells ( following BKC treatment ) are unable to take up fluorescein ( such cells typically all stained with PI ) . This was consistent with previous findings by this laboratory ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) , and with those of Bandamwar and colleagues who reported minimal fluorescein fluorescence in non - viable human corneal limbal epithelial ( HCLE ) cells ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) . Interestingly MPS formulations P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 , both of which are associated with clinical hyperfluorescence , produced little PI staining and no significant changes in metabolic activity . Conversely , increased PI staining and loss in metabolic activity were found after treatment with the MPS formulations PQ1 - Alex - 904 and PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 , both of which are clinically associated with low levels of fluorescence . These findings suggest strongly that in contrast with the previously held view that fluorescein hyperfluorescence reflects ‘toxicity staining’ , fluorescein staining in fact indicates an absence of cytotoxicity . When a clinician observes ‘staining’ on the ocular surface , it is therefore not indicative of dead cells but rather indicates metabolically fully functional cells . However nonetheless the presence of MPS increases fluorescein staining in these otherwise healthy cells . In the later stages of our study , the processes - presumably stimulated by MPS P - PQ - 1107 and P - 1107 – may be responsible for this hyperfluorescence were examined . Although it was shown that hyperfluorescence did not correlate with necrosis , it was possible that cells taking up fluorescein were undergoing apoptosis . However , notably none of the test MPS formulations resulted in increased staining for Caspase - 3 , which is a 154 vital downstream protease in the apoptosis pathway ( J . Li & Yuan 2008 ; McIlwain et al . 2013 ) . Interestingly , blebbing ( a morphological change of the cell membrane associated with apoptosis ( Mills et al . 1998 ; Ziegler & Groscurth 2004 ) ) was consistently seen in P - PQ1 - 1107 treated cells . However such morphological change was not observed with P - 1107 treatment even though both formulations are known to increase hyperfluorescence in vitro and in vivo . These data further suggest apoptosis is unrelated to hyperfluorescence . These recent findings are in contrast to a study by Bandamwar and colleagues ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) , who investigated the effect of toxic levels of PHMB on fluorescein staining . However the latter study involved staining for the early apoptotic marker Annexin V tagged with a red fluorophore for cells co - stained with the red fluorescent stain PI . The two stains were differentiated based only on cellular location of red fluorescence , and ‘background’ staining with PI may have been difficult to distinguish from Annexin V staining . This laboratory previously found that fluorescein uptake and egress from the cell are active processes , which are inhibited at low temperature ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . This was investigated this further here by directly inhibiting dynamin - dependent pathways in L929 and HC cells using dynasore , a reversible inhibitor of dynamin . Dynasore treatment caused a decrease in fluorescein uptake for both control and MPS - treated cells . Dynamin is a GTPase protein implicated in a number of energy dependent endocytic pathways ( Doherty & McMahon 2009 ; Conner & Schmid 2003 ) and interacts with several actin - binding proteins ( Orth et al . 2002 ; Kessels et al . 2001 ; Jeng & Welch 2001 ) ; previous to this work , dynamin has not been investigated in association with fluorescein internalisation . These data suggest dynamin and its associated actin binding proteins are directly involved and contribute to the active internalisation of fluorescein by the cell . It was also found that metabolic activity is unaffected by treatment with dynasore , in line with earlier findings 155 that only viable cells can mediate fluorescein uptake . However , as fluorescein uptake was not completely inhibited by dynasore , it is possibly that other endocytic or active pathways independent of dynamin may contribute to some extent to uptake . Finally , this work examined which components of the two MPS which increase fluorescein uptake may be responsible for increasing the active internalisation of fluorescein . Previous studies of MPS - associated hyperfluorescence focus on the effects of biocides . However in this work , the potential hyperfluorescence - inducing effects of surfactants were investigated . The non - ionic surfactant Tetronic 1107 is common to both MPS associated with increased hyperfluorescence , but is not present in the two MPS that do not increase fluorescein uptake . It was observed that hyperfluorescence intensity increases significantly after treatment with 1 % ( w / v ) Tetronic 1107 ( the concentration found in P - PQ - 1107 and P - 1107 ) , and in L929 cells reaches a comparable level to that found after both P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 treatment . A smaller increase in fluorescein uptake was also found for L929 cells treated with 0 . 1 % and 10 % Tetronic 1107 . These data suggest Tetronic 1107 plays a key role in the hyperfluorescence caused by these MPS . Tetronic 1107 typically forms polymeric micelles which are more stable and less damaging to the lipid bilayer when compared to the typical surfactant micelle ( Sandez - Macho et al . 2015 ) . Tetronic 1107 , at all concentrations tested , caused no significant change in metabolic activity , consistent with other reports ( Rey - Rico et al . 2011 ) . Tetronics are also otherwise known as block copolymers . As polymeric micelles can readily encapsulate and solubilise otherwise poorly water - soluble drugs , block copolymers are widely studied for their drug delivery properties ( Alakhov et al . 1996 ; Harada & Kataoka 1998 ; Cammas et al . 1997 ) . The internalisation pathway of polymeric micelles and associated drug compounds remains unclear in the literature . However , a number of studies report polymeric micelle uptake is time - , pH - , energy - , and temperature - dependent ( Allen et al . 1999 ; Luo et al . 2002 ) , and report 156 localisation to several cytoplasmic organelles ( Savic et al . 2003 ) . Interestingly , it has been proposed that polymeric micelle uptake is also mediated by endocytosis ( Allen et al . 1999 ; Luo et al . 2002 ; Savic et al . 2003 ) . This finding that Tetronic 1107 may be responsible for MPS stimulation of fluorescein hyperfluorescence , may therefore be directly linked to the evidence for the role of dynamin - dependent processes ( which include endocytosis ) as a key mediator of fluorescein hyperfluorescence . In contrast , the surfactant Triton X - 100 does not induce increased fluorescein uptake in HC cells when used at levels above its CMC . These data suggest the mechanism for Tetronic 1107 induced hyperfluorescence may be specific to this block copolymer , and cannot be replicated with the similarly non - ionic surfactant Triton X - 100 . Triton X - 100 is often used to permeate cell membranes for protein extraction and prolonged exposure to this surfactant is known to cause lysis ( Koley & Bard 2010 ) . Thus it is perhaps unsurprising that also above its CMC , a significant decrease in metabolic activity is observed , which may counteract any increase in hyperfluorescence , once again in line with previous findings that non - viable and non - metabolically active cells exhibit minimal hyperfluorescence . Although PHMB - based MPS in most cases are associated with ocular staining ( as seen in the Andrasko Corneal Staining Grid ; www . staininggrid . com ) , in light of these current findings , the surfactant present may perhaps be more predicative of clinical hyperfluorescence . This study is the first to investigate the effects of surfactants on fluorescein uptake , and these findings suggest that hyperfluorescence could be attributed to the surfactant component in MPS formulations . Although interactions of the other MPS components in these solutions and the presence of a contact lens may contribute to the overall hyperfluorescence , these data suggest Tetronic 1107 or other surfactant effects on 157 active uptake processes in the cells is central to SICS . More broadly these findings suggest that active dynamin - dependent processes may be a key component of corneal fluorescein hyperfluorescence caused by a variety of stimuli . 5 . 6 . Conclusions These findings suggest that increased fluorescein hyperfluorescence is a marker for healthy metabolically active cells , and the absence of fluorescein staining is indicative of cytotoxicity . The uptake of fluorescein into the cell body appears to involve dynamin - associated processes . Increased fluorescein hyperfluorescence after MPS exposure is associated with the surfactant Tetronic 1107 , especially when present at 1 % ( w / v ) . This in vitro model might be used to screen potential solution formulations and components to predict fluorescein staining on the ocular surface , and to also investigate their implications on corneal health . 158 Chapter 6 Investigation of active transport mechanisms contributing to fluorescein hyperfluorescence and of the chemical effects of biocides on fluorescein uptake 159 6 . 1 . Abstract Purpose : To investigate receptor mediated uptake , mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and bulk fluid endocytosis as novel biological mechanisms contributing to hyperfluorescence in cell culture , and to explore the chemical effects of biocides on cell viability and fluorescein uptake . Methods : L929 cells were treated with oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler DNP and fluorescein to evaluate the effect of increased metabolic activity ( and loss of ATP production ) on fluorescein uptake . Receptor mediated uptake in murine fibroblasts was assessed by starving cells of serum overnight before treating with 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein . Fluorescein uptake was then quantified in both instances using high content analysis ( HCA ) . A further biological mechanism investigated was macropinocytosis in both L929 and human corneal ( HC ) cells . Fluorescein uptake and FITC - conjugated dextran uptake ( a marker used to identify macropinocytosis ) was assessed in MPS treated human corneal ( HC ) cells using fluorescence microscopy . Similarly , pHRodo® Red Dextran , MPS and EIPA ( a macropinocytosis inhibitor ) were used to investigate fluorescein uptake by macropinocytosis in L929 cells . Finally , the effect of the biocides PHMB and PQ - 1 on cell viability was tested at concentrations present in the test MPS formulations used throughout this work , and their impact on hyperfluorescence was evaluated using HCA . Results : Fluorescein uptake was unaffected by overnight serum starvation and by DNP treatment . Macropinocytosis was not increased by hyperfluorescence - inducing MPS , but surprisingly was found to be elevated by those MPS that have not been found to increase hyperfluorescence ( PQ1 - Alex - 904 and PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 ) . This was further confirmed with the finding that the macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA did not reduce hyperfluorescence after P - PQ1 - 1107 treatment . PHMB and PQ - 1 both caused a large decrease in metabolic 160 activity for all concentrations tested , and was reflected by limited fluorescein uptake across all biocide concentrations tested . Conclusions : Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is not required for fluorescein uptake , and the lack of effect of serum starvation on fluorescein uptake suggests fluorescein uptake is unlikely to be a specific receptor - mediated endocytic process . In association with hyperfluorescence inducing MPS , macropinocytosis does not contribute to increased fluorescein uptake after MPS - treatment . Finally the biocides PHMB and PQ - 1 alone do not appear to be the components responsible for mediating fluorescein uptake in hyperfluorescence inducing MPS formulations ( confirming once again that cells do not show increased fluorescein uptake similar to those hyperfluorescence inducing formulations in response to a toxic stimulus ) . 161 6 . 2 . Introduction Sodium fluorescein ( ‘fluorescein’ ) has many applications , with these exploiting its fluorescent properties . Uses include determining skin damage in fish ( Livengood et al . 2013 ) , detecting trace amounts of blood in forensic science ( Cheeseman & Dimeo 1995 ; Martin & Cahill 2004 ) and an ocular surface diagnostic tool in ophthalmology . In particular , fluorescein is used to assess conjunctival and corneal integrity ( Lofstrom 2005 ; Dumbleton 2002 ; Holden et al . 2001 ) by topically applying a small volume of an aqueous solution of fluorescein ( 1mg / ml or 2mg / ml ) to the ocular surface . Staining of the ocular surface ( ‘hyperfluorescence’ ) is conventionally interpreted to be indicative of poor ocular health ( G . Wilson et al . 1995 ; Tabery 1992 ; Tabery 2003a ; Tabery 2003b ) . One type of hyperfluorescence often seen in practice occurs with certain soft contact lens and multi - purpose solutions ( MPS ) combinations known as solution induced corneal staining ( SICS ) ( Andrasko & Ryen 2008 ; Carnt , Willcox , et al . 2007 ; L . Jones et al . 2002 ) . Although some progress has been made in underpinning the biological and chemical basis of SICS , the precise mechanism ( s ) for fluorescein uptake and hyperfluorescence inducing activities of major MPS components are yet to be defined . There are a number of hypotheses proposed for hyperfluorescence on the ocular surface . It has previously been suggested that fluorescein pools in the impressions of the epithelial tissue and in the tear film which results in an increase in observed hyperfluorescence ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . Another proposed mechanism is that hyperfluorescence is the increase in fluorescein moving freely throughout the spaces between cells referred to as the ingress model ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . A hypothesis that has been investigated more recently is that fluorescein taken into epithelial cells and hyperfluorescence reflects the internalisation of fluorescein in the cell body ( Mokhtarzadeh et al . 2011 ; Bakkar et al . 2014 ; Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) . 162 MPS are sterile single - use formulations used to disinfect and store re - usable contact lenses . A number of studies report cytotoxic effects of certain contact lens solutions ( Choy et al . 2012 ; Wright & Mowrey - McKee 2005 ; Dutot et al . 2008 ; Dutot et al . 2010 ) . It is suggested that hyperfluorescence associated with the use of certain MPS is a result of cellular damage although two previous studies suggest SICS does not reflect cytotoxicity ( Tchao et al . 2002 ; Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . In Chapter 5 , using propidium iodide ( PI ) ( a fluorescent necrosis marker ) and metabolic activity assays , it was demonstrated that two MPS associated with minimal hyperfluorescence clinically , similarly result in minimal hyperfluorescence in cell culture and also cause necrosis . Conversely , two MPS typically associated with an increase in hyperfluorescence clinically also caused hyperfluorescence in cell culture , though with minimal necrosis . It has further been suggested that hyperfluorescence is an indicator of apoptosis ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) . A study by Bandamwar and colleagues ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) demonstrated an increase in hyperfluorescence in apoptotic human corneal limbal epithelial ( HCLE ) cells . Apoptosis in this study was identified by localisation of fluorescence of the apoptosis marker Annexin V tagged with a red fluorophore in cells also treated with red fluorescent necrosis marker PI . However , ‘background’ staining of PI may have interfered with the red fluorescence observed for Annexin V , making it difficult to measure any genuine apoptosis . This is in contrast to the findings in Chapter 5 , where murine fibroblasts treated with both hyperfluorescence inducing and non - hyperfluorescence inducing MPS did not exhibit markers of apoptosis above that of the control . A study from this laboratory previously reported that fluorescein uptake and release is temperature dependent and thus involves active transport ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . By definition , active transport mechanisms ( including endocytosis and exocytosis ) are energy dependent , ATP requiring processes . The compound 2 , 4 - dinitrophenol ( DNP ) is known to 163 increase metabolic rate ( Vaughan et al . 2012 ; Scheindlin 2008 ) by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation and reducing ATP synthesis ( Desquiret et al . 2006 ; Joel et al . 1967 ; Sibille et al . 1995 ) . To investigate the relationship between hyperfluorescence and active transport mechanisms , fluorescein uptake in DNP - treated cells was additionally measured . As also previously shown in Chapter 5 , fluorescein uptake is associated with dynamin - mediated processes , a GTP - ase protein that has been implicated in a number of endocytic pathways ( Doherty & McMahon 2009 ) . After treatment with those MPS associated with increased hyperfluorescence ( P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 ) and dynasore ( a dynamin inhibitor ) in both murine fibroblasts and HC cells , a significant decrease in fluorescein uptake was observed . However hyperfluorescence is not entirely dependent on these processes suggesting that other routes of fluorescein uptake exist . Receptor - mediated endocytosis is also an energy dependent process , where molecules such as transferrin and lipoproteins complexes ( for example low density lipoproteins [ LDL ] ) are internalised when bound to unique receptors on the cell surface ( Schwartz 1995 ; Ciechanover et al . 1983 ) . Serum ( fetal bovine serum [ FBS ] or fetal calf serum [ FCS ] ) , which is a key constituent of cell culture medium , contains such proteins and growth factors . Various aspects of cell growth and physiology contribute to the distribution of receptors in cells ( Ciechanover et al . 1983 ) . For example , transferrin in serum - supplemented growth medium may affect the number ( J . H . Ward et al . 1982 ) and distribution ( Klausner et al . 1983 ) of transferrin receptors . Serum is thus often omitted or used at a much lower concentration when preparing cell cultures for uptake assays so as not to influence the overall endocytic measurement ( Soraj et al . 2012 ; Commisso et al . 2014 ; Fielding et al . 2012 ; Hernaez & Alonso 2010 ) . To investigate whether fluorescein is internalised via receptor - mediated endocytosis , hyperfluorescence was measured in cells cultured in serum free media . The assumption was that following maintenance under serum - free conditions , any receptors being utilised by fluorescein 164 would not be blocked by any competing serum - component . Thus should receptor - mediated uptake occur , a higher fluorescein uptake for serum - free maintained cells would be expected relative to cells grown in the presence of growth medium containing serum . A further biological mechanism studied in this work was macropinocytosis , the bulk uptake of fluids from the extracellular environment . Although macropinocytosis is a dynamin independent process , it has been shown that dynasore can prevent membrane ruffling typical of this uptake mechanism ( Preta et al . 2015 ) . Therefore , in this study macropinocytosis as an additional pathway for fluorescein entry into cell in the absence of dynamin inhibitor ( dynasore ) was investigated . Dextran is frequently used as a marker molecule for macropinocytosis ( Falcone et al . 2006 ) , and so the relative effects of FITC - conjugated dextran ( 10kDa ) uptake in MPS treated cells were measured . Additionally , the chemical 5 - ( N - ethyl - N - isopropyl ) amiloride ( EIPA ) , a more potent analogue of the well - known macropinocytosis inhibitor Amiloride ( Meier et al . 2002 ; West et al . 1989 ) , was used to investigate whether inhibition of macropinocytosis might reduce fluorescein uptake . It is noteworthy that previous to this study , receptor - mediated uptake , macropinocytosis and the effect of oxidative phosphorylation on hyperfluorescence have not been investigated as biological mechanisms underpinning MPS induced fluorescein . MPS formulations typically comprise a number of generic classes of compounds , including surfactants ( for example Tetronics® ) , biocides such as PHMB and Polyquaternium - 1 ( PQ - 1 ) and buffers ( borate , phosphate or citrate ) . In addition to the further studies of the mechanism underlying hyperfluorescence , the potential importance of MPS biocides in mediating the ability of MPS to increase hyperfluorescence was also investigated . Current applications of the broad spectrum antimicrobial PHMB ( Carmona - Ribeiro & de Melo Carrasco 2013 ) range from swimming pool sanitation ( Kusnetsov et al . 1997 ) to use as an 165 anti - microbial mouthwash ( Rosin et al . 2001 ) . PHMB also acts against some fungi and protozoa where it is typically used to treat Acanthamoeba keratitis ( Gray et al . 1994 ) . PQ - 1 , a quaternary ammonium compound related to the preservative BKC , again primarily acts against bacteria with reports of limited activity against Acanthamoeba castellanii ( Codling et al . 2003 ) . Biocides are often considered to be the main hyperfluorescence - inducing component in an MPS formulation . Indeed , Andrasko and colleagues report that clinical hyperfluorescence increases with those MPS containing biocide PHMB ; this is presented in the Andrasko Staining Grid ( accessible at www . staininggrid . com ) . Similarly , Carnt et al have demonstrated an increase in clinical hyperfluorescence with biocide PQ - 1 based solutions ( Carnt , Willcox , et al . 2007 ) . However , using an in vitro model it was previously demonstrated in Chapter 5 that fluorescein uptake is induced in solutions containing Tetronic 1107 , a non - ionic surfactant found in hyperfluorescence - inducing MPS . It was also reported that only metabolically active and viable cells exhibit increased hyperfluorescence ( Chapter 5 ) . Therefore , in this study fluorescein uptake a result of MPS biocide induced cytotoxicity in cell culture was investigated . Interestingly , clinical hyperfluorescence is often reported as the result of the biocide component in an MPS , although the ability of individual biocides to cause hyperfluorescence at concentrations relevant to those found in MPS formulations has not been directly investigated ; thus in this work , biocides were investigated at concentrations relevant to those found in four different MPS , two of which are associated with clinical hyperfluorescence . To summarise , using the unique in vitro model developed in this thesis , the purpose of this study was to a ) study active transport processes including receptor - mediated uptake and macropinocytosis as biological mechanisms underpinning hyperfluorescence and ( b ) investigate the relationship between cellular viability and fluorescein uptake as an effect of MPS biocides PQ - 1 and PHMB . 166 6 . 3 . Methods and Materials Cell culture 6 . 3 . 1 . HC cells were obtained from human corneal explants provided by Manchester Eye Bank . Briefly , HC were grown from segmented sections of corneal explants in wells pre - coated for 1 hour with 0 . 01 % calf - skin type I collagen ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) in Dulbecco’s PBS ( PBS ) ( ThermoFisher , UK ) . This protocol was adapted from Kahn et al , 1994 ( Kahn et al . 1993 ) . Murine fibroblasts ( L929 cells ) ( ECACC , UK ) and HC cells were maintained at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) containing 4500mg - L glucose ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) supplemented with 10 % v / v fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) and 4mM L - glutamine ( Gibco by Life Technologies , UK ) , referred to hereafter as ‘growth medium’ . For HC cells , all tissue culture flasks and plates had been pre - coated for 1 hour with 0 . 01 % calf - skin type I collagen in PBS . Both cell types were maintained until growth had reached approximately 80 % confluency , and were then rinsed with PBS and treated with 0 . 25 % trypsin - EDTA ( Life Technologies , UK ) for L929 cells or 0 . 05 % trypsin - EDTA in PBS for HC cells . After cell detachment trypsin - EDTA was neutralised by addition of equal volumes of growth medium . For experiments , cells were seeded in 24 - well plates ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) at a density of 1x10 5 cell / well for fluorescence microscopy or in 96 well plates ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) at 2 . 5x10 4 cells / well for high content analysis ( HCA ) or cell viability experiments using growth medium . In all cases cells were used in experiments after overnight growth . In the instance of serum starvation , L929 cells were cultured overnight using FBS free growth medium . Cell treatment with MPS 6 . 3 . 2 . MPS formulations were obtained commercially based on their differential association with clinical fluorescein hyperfluorescence , and their main biocide and surfactant components . Cells were treated with MPS formulations for 2 hours at 100 % v / v concentration . MPS investigated which are known to cause hyperfluorescence were : ReNu Sensitive Multi - 167 purpose solution® ( Bausch + Lomb ) referred to as P - 1107 and Biotrue® ( Bausch + Lomb ) referred to as P - PQ1 - 1107 . MPS investigated which do not cause hyperfluorescence were : Complete RevitaLens® ( AMO ) referred to as PQ1 - Alex - 904 and Opti - Free Replenish® ( Alcon ) referred to as PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 . The main biocide and surfactant components in these MPS can be seen in Table 14 . Effects were compared with cells treated for 2 hours with growth medium ( media control ) , or borate buffer ( carrier control ) . Borate buffer was prepared using 0 . 6 % boric acid and 0 . 1 % borax in distilled water . Table 14 : MPS formulations . Cell treatment with fluorescein 6 . 3 . 3 . After treatment with test solutions / MPS formulations , cells were incubated with 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein ( Fluorescein Sodium salt ; Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) in PBS for 10 minutes at 37°C . Hoechst 33342 ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) , at a final concentration of 0 . 2mg / ml in PBS , was added to each well to enable identification of all the nuclei in each cell population as required for high content analysis ( described below in Section 6 . 3 . 8 ) . On removal from the incubator , cells were kept cold and washed three times with cold PBS .

Cells were kept on ice until high content analysis ( HCA ) or fluorescence microscopy with this being carried out within 5 minutes from the end of treatment ( described in Sections 6 . 3 . 8 and 6 . 3 . 9 respectively ) . Cell treatment with DNP 6 . 3 . 4 . L929 cells were treated with a 100µM solution of 2 , 4 - dinitrophenol ( DNP ; Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) prepared in growth medium and 10 % DMSO to aid compound solubilisation . For cell treatment , media was removed from each well after overnight growth and 100µM DNP was added for 15 minutes at 37°C . Effects on cell metabolic activity were then compared with cells treated with growth medium only ( media control ) . Cell treatment with FITC - dextran , EIPA , and pHRodo 6 . 3 . 5 . Fluorescein isothiocyanite ( FITC ) conjugated dextran ( 10000 MW ; Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) was used as a fluid - phase marker to identify macropinosomes in L929 cells treated with test MPS formulations . After treatment with media or MPS formulations as described in 6 . 3 . 2 , FITC - dextran was prepared in PBS and added to cells at a final concentration of 0 . 5mg / ml for 10 minutes at 37°C . Cells were then washed three times with cold PBS , and kept cold prior to fluorescence microscopy ( described in Section 6 . 3 . 9 ) . In subsequent experiments , the effect of fluorescein uptake in HC cells treated with macropinocytosis inhibitor 5 - ( N - Ethyl - N - Isopropyl ) - Amiloride ( EIPA ; Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) was investigated . A solution of 50µM EIPA was prepared in growth medium and 0 . 06 % DMSO . HC cells were treated with MPS P - PQ1 - 1107 for 2 hours at 100 % v / v and then 50µM EIPA for 30 minutes at 37°C . To detect macropinocytosis , pHRodo® Red Dextran ( Molecular Probes® by Life Technologies , UK ) prepared in Live Cell Imaging Solution ( Molecular Probes® by Life Technologies , UK ) was then added to cells at a final concentration of 20µg / ml for 10 minutes at the same time as fluorescein addition . Cells 169 were subsequently washed three times with cold PBS , and kept cold prior to fluorescence microscopy ( described in Section 6 . 3 . 9 ) . Fluorescein uptake and extent of macropinocytosis in EIPA treated cells were compared to cells treated with P - PQ1 - 1107 only . Cell treatment with MPS components 6 . 3 . 6 . In later experiments , L929 cells were treated for 2 hours at 37°C with 0 . 00005 % , 0 . 00013 % and 0 . 001 % w / v solutions of Cosmocil® CQ PHMB ( Lonza , USA ) , and 0 . 00001 % , 0 . 0001 % , 0 . 0003 % and 0 . 001 % w / v solutions of Polyquaternium - 1 ( PQ - 1 ; Stratech Scientific Ltd , UK ) prepared in borate buffer . Cells were then treated with 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein as described in Section 6 . 3 . 3 and fluorescein uptake was quantified using HCA as descibed in Section 6 . 3 . 8 . Metabolic activity assays ( MTT ) 6 . 3 . 7 . Cells growing in 96 well plates were treated with test formulations , before aspiration and replacement with media containing 0 . 5mg / ml thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) , and subsequent incubation for 2 hours at 37°C . Media containing MTT was then aspirated , and insoluble formazan was solubilised using 100µl of DMSO ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) , followed by assessment of absorbance at 555nm . High content analysis ( HCA ) 6 . 3 . 8 . Quantification of fluorescein uptake was carried out using the Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS Reader , and the accompanying HCS Studio Cell 2 . 0 Analysis Software . Cells were visualised using the ArrayScan ™ automated Observer Z1 inverted microscope ( Zeiss ) with transmitted light and fluorescence using an XF53 filter wheel . High - resolution images were taken using a CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Orca ER ) with a 5x / 0 . 25 Fluar objective . Images of fluorescein stained cells were taken using 0 . 033 seconds exposure for all experiments . One field of view was taken per well , with multiple wells per treatment tested to enable quick data collection . Samples were incubated at 4°C as they were imaged to 170 limit fluorescein loss from cells . Using a built in bioapplication and adjusted for cell type , the mean pixel intensity of each cell was measured per treatment . The median fluorescence intensity value was then reported in Arbitrary Units ( AU ) ( median ( lower 95 % CI limit - upper 95 % CI limit ) ) . Fluorescence microscopy 6 . 3 . 9 . Widefield fluorescent images were collected on an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope using a 10x / 0 . 3 UPlanFL N , or 20x / 0 . 45 LUC PlanFL N ( Ph1 ) objective and captured using an Orca ER camera ( Hamamatsu ) through CellSens software ( Olympus ) . All images were acquired sequentially and using the appropriate filters to ensure no bleed through the channels . Images were processed using ImageJ software . Statistical analysis 6 . 3 . 10 . All fluorescein fluorescence intensity data are presented as the median ( lower 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) – upper limit 95 % CI ) , where error bars represent 95 % CI . Metabolic activities are presented as a percentage of the appropriate control and the associated 95 % CI , calculated using the median metabolic activity values . All data were analysed using non - parametric Kruskal - Wallis ANOVA and Dunn’s multiple comparison post - hoc tests unless otherwise stated . The level of statistical analysis was set to * p = 0 . 05 , * * p = 0 . 01 and * * * p ≤ 0 . 001 for all tests . 6 . 4 . Results Investigation of biological mechanisms underpinning hyperfluorescence 6 . 4 . 1 . Fluorescein uptake is unaffected by DNP , an oxidative phosphorylation 6 . 4 . 1 . 1 . uncoupler Initially the effect of DNP treatment on fluorescein uptake by L929 cells were examined . L929 cells treated with DNP exhibited a statistically significant increase in metabolic activity relative to media control ( 130 . 5 % ( 110 . 5 - 149 . 6 % ; p = 0 . 04 ) ( n = 8 wells for both treatments ) suggesting a successful uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation . A large but 171 statistically non - significant decrease in metabolic activity was observed with BKC ( which is known to cause necrosis ) ( n = 6 wells ) ( 3 . 4 % ( 2 . 4 - 3 . 8 % ) p = 0 . 14 ; Figure 37 ) . The mean number of cells after treatment with media control was 607 cells ( 505 - 709 cells ) ( n = 3 wells ) whereas the mean number of cells treated after treatment with DNP decreased to 317 cells ( 267 - 366 cells ) ( n = 3 wells ) . The median fluorescein intensities and associated lower 95 % CI – upper 95 % CI ( reported in AU ) measured with media control and DNP treatments were 13 . 91 ( 13 . 8 - 14 ) and 14 . 3 ( 14 . 2 - 14 . 4 ) respectively ( Figure 38 ) . Using the Mann - Whitney statistical test , the fluorescence intensity after DNP treatment was statistically greater than that exhibited by media control treated cells ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , however this difference ( and associated 95 % CI ) was extremely small ( 0 . 41 ( 0 . 40 - 0 . 60 ) . The data set acquired for fluorescein fluorescence ( Figure 38 ) is much larger than that collected for metabolic activity ( Figure 37 ) . For example , due to the nature of each assay , an average of 317 cells , and thus an average of 317 fluorescence intensity data points , were collected for DNP treated cells in comparison to 8 data points of absorbance values in similarly DNP treated cells . Therefore , it is likely that this accounts for the statistically significant increase in fluorescence intensity , although small , ( Figure 38 ) compared to the large , yet statistically less significant , change in metabolic activity ( Figure 37 ) . More importantly , the statistical significance calculated for fluorescence intensity values are unlikely to be related to the statistically significant increase exhibited in metabolic activity . Thus , it is unlikely that fluorescein uptake is affected by small increases in metabolic activity ( and the associated loss of ATP production ) induced by DNP . 172 Figure 37 : Effect of DNP and BKC on L929 cell metabolic activity ( n = 8 wells in both instances ) .

L929 cells were grown overnight in serum free media before fluorescein treatment to investigate receptor - mediated uptake as a potential mechanism of fluorescein uptake . All fluorescein intensity values are reported as the median fluorescence intensity in Arbitrary Units ( AU ) and associated lower 95 % CI - upper 95 % CI . Fluorescein uptake in L929 cells treated overnight with serum free media was not statistically different to that demonstrated by overnight treatment with media control ( 439 . 7 ( 427 - 450 . 2 ) and 401 . 7 ( 355 . 6 - 450 ) respectively ; p = 0 . 77 ) . This suggests fluorescein uptake is unlikely to be a receptor - mediated process . As expected , an increase in fluorescein uptake was observed in L929 cells treated with MPS formulations P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 and minimal fluorescence intensities were measured in PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 treated cells compared to media control ( p < 0 . 0001 in all instances ) . Similarly , the same trend in fluorescence intensities was also observed in comparison to serum free media treated cells ( p < 0 . 0001 in all instances ) . As seen in Table 15 , the respective mean number of cells per field of view cultured in serum free media was comparable to that for media control , indicating that serum deprivation did not have a detrimental effect on L929 cell survival .

FITC conjugated dextran was used to explore the association of macropinocytosis and fluorescein uptake . HC cells were treated with Hoechst 33342 to identify individual cells and with FITC - Dextran , a marker for macropinocytosis ( Figure 40 ) . Interestingly , an increase in dextran uptake was observed with the non - hyperfluorescence inducing MPS PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 compared to media control , evidenced by the increase in the number of cells exhibiting green fluorescence ( Figure 40 ) . Nevertheless , dextran uptake in cells treated with hyperfluorescence inducing MPS P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 appeared to be a little more than that observed for media control treated cells , but was not comparable to the increase in dextran uptake observed with PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 .

To confirm that macropinocytosis was not associated with increased hyperfluorescence , fluorescein uptake was tested in L929 cells treated with hyperfluorescence inducing MPS P - PQ1 - 1107 and macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA . Using pHRodo® Red Dextran as a marker for macropinocytosis , it was confirmed that EIPA decreased macropinosome formation as seen by the loss of red fluorescence in Figure 41D . However , on fluorescein addition to P - PQ1 - 1107 and EIPA treated cells , no change in fluorescein uptake was observed as seen by the extent of green fluorescence apparent in Figure 41F compared to cells treated with P - PQ1 - 1107 only ( Figure 41E ) . These data together suggest increased fluorescein uptake caused by hyperfluorescence inducing MPS is not a macropinocytosis associated process .

A large but statistically non - significant decrease in metabolic activity was observed in borate buffer + FL treated cells ( 26 . 8 % ( 25 . 2 - 28 . 9 % ) ; p > 0 . 9999 ) . The metabolic activity of all concentrations of PQ - 1 + FL treated cells were statistically comparable to carrier control borate buffer + FL treated cells ( p > 0 . 9999 , p > 0 . 9999 , p > 0 . 9999 and p = 0 . 17 with increasing concentrations of PQ - 1 ) .

These losses in metabolic activity exhibited with PHMB were however not statistically different to the metabolic activity of media control treated cells ( p = 0 . 49 , p = 0 . 34 and p = 0 . 3 respectively ) .

Fluorescein uptake in borate buffer ( carrier control ) treated cells was significantly less than that in media control treated cells ( 52 . 1 ( 45 . 1 - 60 . 2 ) and 182 . 8 ( 178 . 6 - 187 . 2 ) respectively ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . As expected , the fluorescence intensities of PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 treated cells were significantly less than that demonstrated by both media control and borate buffer treatments , and fluorescein uptake in cells treated with P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 was signficantly greater than that observed in media control and borate buffer treated cells ( p < 0 . 0001 in all instances ) . The median fluorescence intensity increased when L929 cells were treated with 0 . 00001 % and 0 . 0001 % PQ - 1 ( the concentration of PQ - 1 in hyperfluorescence inducing MPS P - PQ1 - 1107 ) to 336 . 7 ( 324 . 2 - 348 ) and 322 ( 314 . 2 - 329 . 4 ) respectively from that exhibited by both borate buffer and media control treatments ( p < 0 . 0001 in all instances ) . With increasing PQ - 1 concentrations 0 . 0003 % and 0 . 001 % PQ - 1 , concentrations found in PQ1 - Alex - 904 and PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 formulations respectively , the fluorescence intensities were significantly less than that exhibited with media control ( 16 ( 15 . 1 - 16 . 7 ) ; p < 0 . 0001 and 128 . 1 ( 126 . 8 - 129 . 3 ) ; p = 0 . 002 respectively ) . Fluorescein intensity of 0 . 0003 % PQ - 1 treated cells was also significantly less than the carrier control borate buffer ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . Interestingly however , the highest concentration of PQ - 1 tested ( 0 . 001 % w / v ) exhibited an increase in fluorescence intensity compared to its carrier control ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . Nevertheless , the fluorescence intensities of cells treated with all concentrations of PQ - 1 tested were significantly less than that demonstrated by hyperfluorescence inducing 180 formulations P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 , and were greater than that exhibited by these MPS formulations associated with low levels of hyperfluorescence ( p < 0 . 0001 all instances ) . Given that a decrease in metabolic activity was observed in cells identically treated with PQ - 1 ( Section 6 . 4 . 3 ) , it is perhaps unsurprising that these data indicate that PQ - 1 alone cannot cause the levels of hyperfluorescence typically observed with P - PQ1 - 1107 . It is also unlikely to be the only component that causes the loss of hyperfluorescence associated with PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 .

In this instance , fluorescein uptake in borate buffer treated cells was significantly greater than that demonstrated by media control treated cells ( 341 . 9 ( 317 . 7 - 369 . 1 ) and 48 . 3 ( 46 - 50 . 6 ) ; p < 0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 45 ) . With 0 . 00005 % and 0 . 00013 % PHMB , concentrations found in hyperfluorescence inducing MPS P - 1107 and P - PQ1 - 1107 respectively , the median fluorescein intensities were statistically greater than that observed in media control treated cells ( 345 . 5 ( 336 . 5 - 354 . 8 ) and 428 . 9 ( 410 . 2 - 445 . 4 ) respectively ; p < 0 . 0001 in both instances ) . The fluorescence intensity of 0 . 00005 % and 0 . 00013 % PHMB treated cells were also statistically greater than but similar to that exhibited by carrier control treated cells ( p = 0 . 001 and p = 0 . 006 respectively ) suggesting an effect of the carrier control at these concentrations of PHMB . At the highest PHMB concentration of 0 . 001 % PHMB however , fluorescence intensity signficantly decreases exhibiting fluorescence intensity values less than both media and carrier control ( 0 . 29 ( 0 . 25 - 0 . 35 ) ; p < 0 . 0001 in both instances ) . As expected , fluorescein uptake in cells treated with P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 was greater than that in cells treated with media control and borate buffer , and PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 treated cells exhibited a significant decrease in intensity ( p < 0 . 0001 in all instances ) . Fluorescein uptake in cells treated with PHMB ( at all concentrations ) were statistically less than that demonstrated by cells treated with hyperfluorescence inducing formulations P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 , but were greater than that exhibited by cells treated with formulations PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 ( p < 0 . 0001 in all instances ) . The minimal hyperfluorescence observed with PHMB treatments is in line with the decrease in metabolic activities measured ( as seen in Section 6 . 4 . 3 . 2 ) and with previous finding that 182 only metabolically active cells exhibit increased hyperfluorescence . These data strongly indicate that PHMB alone cannot cause the levels of hyperfluorescence typically observed with P - 1107 or P - PQ1 - 1107 .

Discussion Various biological and chemical triggers of hyperfluorescence were investigated to improve understanding of clinical ocular staining . In previous work it was found that hyperfluorescence is a mechanism associated with GTP - ase dynamin , which has been implicated in a number of ATP - requiring endocytic processes . This in line with earlier findings from this laboratory which show that fluorescein uptake is an active and energy dependent process ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . However , hyperfluorescence appeared not to be dependent on dynamin - associated mechanisms alone , and so the ATP requirement of fluorescein uptake mechanisms using DNP as well as receptor - mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis as further biological mechanism of fluorescein uptake were explored . Given that a number of studies implicate biocides as the components responsible , in this work the hyperfluorescence inducing abilities of biocides PHMB and PQ - 1 as an effect of their respective cytotoxicity capabilities was also studied . Fluorescein internalisation as a function of metabolic activity and ATP production was investigated in L929 cells . Cells treated with DNP indeed demonstrated an increase in metabolic activity as seen in Figure 37 , suggesting a successful uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation . In brief , DNP acts a protonophore moving protons across lipid bilayers . This creates a leak in the inner mitochondrial membrane destroying the proton gradient and bypasses the requirement for ATP - synthase and consequently , energy from the gradient is dissipated as heat instead of generating ATP ( Desquiret et al . 2006 ; Joel et al . 1967 ; Sibille et al . 1995 ) . DNP is used in a range of disciplines . For example , it has been used to explore metabolic rates in bobwhite quails ( Dominguez et al . 1993 ) and in skeletal muscle cells ( Vaughan et al . 2012 ) , to inhibit bacterial adhesion to surfaces ( Paul 1984 ; Jain et al . 2007 ) and has recently been discovered to be a neuroprotective compound ( Freitas - Correa et al . 2013 ) . It is nevertheless best known for its ability to reversibly inhibit the coupling of oxygen uptake to phosphorylation and generation of high - energy phosphate bonds , first 184 described by Loomis and Lipmann ( Loomis & Lipmann 1948 ) . The chemical DNP was commonly used as a weight loss drug in the 1930’s and became known as a treatment for obesity . However due to increasing reports of serious side effects ( for example , hepatic / renal damage and ‘dinitrophenol cataracts’ ) , the substance was banned in 1938 from further use ( Colman 2007 ) . Although previously MPS were assumed to cause hyperfluorescence due to their toxicity , this laboratory previously demonstrated cellular activity is fundamental for fluorescein hyperfluorescence ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . However the loss of ATP production associated with DNP treatment studied here did not have an effect on cellular hyperfluorescence , and the median fluorescence intensity of DNP treated L929 cells was similar to that exhibited by the media control ( Figure 38 ) . This was also despite the loss of cells with DNP treatment . These data suggest that an ATP requirement for fluorescein uptake is not rate limiting . Indeed , varied energy requirements for the uptake of large and small particle containing vesicles into peritoneal macrophages have been reported by Casley - Smith ( 1969 ) . Inhibiting cell activity with low temperatures and metabolic poisons ( such as DNP ) was seen to prevent cells internalising large , and even groups of small , particles and vesicles ; the uptake of small particles into vesicles and the subsequent internalisation into cells was however unaffected ( Casley Smith 1969 ) . The metabolic activity of DNP treated cells in this instance could not be measured alongside fluorescein quantification and the exact increase in metabolic activity and loss in ATP production is unknown . In future work , the ATP production of DNP and media control treated cells could be investigated more closely using , and quantified , for example , using a luciferase assay . This would also perhaps provide insight into the size of vesicles fluorescein is utilising during internalisation . 185 L929 cell cultures were also grown overnight in serum free media and subsequently treated with 0 . 01 % w / v fluorescein to study receptor - mediated uptake as a biological mechanism of hyperfluorescence . Fluorescein uptake in serum free media treated cells however was not comparable to cells treated with formulations associated with increased fluorescein uptake nor the formulations associated with minimal fluorescein uptake ( Figure 39 ) . Most significantly , little change was seen in the median fluorescein intensity of serum free media treated cells when compared to media control . Given that endocytic assays typically utilise cell cultures starved of serum to maximise receptor - mediated uptake of the components being measured , these data suggest uptake of hyperfluorescence may be unrelated to receptor - mediated endocytic process . It was not presumed that fluorescein binds to a ‘fluorescein specific’ receptor , but rather that it may be capable of binding to receptors which are available for other naturally - occurring ligands . In a broader biological context , indeed a large number of atypical ligands act on receptors in a nonspecific manner , which impedes with the binding of the usual ligand of with the receptor ( Lalanne & Francois 2015 ; Mora 2015 ) . An example of this is immune ligand detection of a T - cell receptor , which must bind specific peptides from amongst a large number of non - specific peptides ( Dittel et al . 1999 ) . In future , inhibitors of receptor - mediated endocytosis ( exposure to hypertonicity , cytoplasmic acidification , phenylarsine oxide or primary amines ) and measurement of LDL uptake as described by Bradley and colleagues ( Bradley et al . 1993 ) could be used to study this mechanism of uptake further . These data nevertheless also strongly indicate that hyperfluorescence is most likely a consequence of specific interactions with MPS components or formulations . Notably , the differential responses in fluorescein uptake induced by MPS formulations could not be replicated with serum deprivation . In this in vitro model , cells undergo a 2 - hour treatment with MPS at 100 % concentration , in line with the transient SICS phenomenon where 186 maximum clinical staining is observed between 2 and 4 hours ( Garofalo et al . 2005 ) , or between 1 and 2 hours post lens wear ( Bandamwar et al . 2010 ) . It is also in keeping with clinical study of hyperfluorescence that was performed with multiple MPS and contact lens combinations by Andrasko and colleagues , seen in the Andrasko Corneal Staining Grid ( www . stainggrid . com ) . During this incubation step in this model , cells are devoid of proteins and various growth factors typically provided by serum supplemented growth medium . As seen in previous work in Chapter 5 , fluorescein uptake is dependent on cell viability . The primary functions of serum are to provide ( a ) growth factors and hormones for cell growth and proliferation ( b ) transport proteins carrying hormones , minerals , trace elements and lipids , ( c ) attachment and spreading factors such as the components of extracellular matrix and ( d ) stabilising and detoxifying factors needed to maintain pH or to inhibit proteases ( Gstraunthaler 2003 ) . By culturing cells in serum - free media it is possible that other cellular processes have also been affected in turn affecting cellular ability to mediate fluorescein uptake . Prolonged serum deprivation has indeed shown to induce apoptosis in various cell lines ( Rawson 1991 ; Lindenboim et al . 1995 ; Mills et al . 1998 ; Rühl et al . 1999 ; Kues et al . 2002 ; Kues et al . 2000 ) , and has seen to reduce cell survival and increase DNA fragmentation in bovine and porcine cell lines ( Gibbons et al , 2002 ) . It is typically used to induce quiescent status of donor cells for nuclear cloning however given that serum also reduces cell viability more desirable synchronisation methods are being investigated ( Hayes et al . 2005 ) . Nevertheless , the mean number of cells of serum starved cells were comparable to the mean number of cells cultured in serum - supplemented growth medium ( media control ) suggesting serum starvation did not have a detrimental effect on cell growth . Basal growth medium also contains other components that aid cell growth ; for example : glucose that is a primary source of energy , amino acids which are compulsory for 187 protein synthesis , vitamins acting as co - enzymes or prosthetic groups in cell metabolism processes , and inorganic salts which are required for cell growth ( Yang & Xiong 2012 ; Arora 2013 ) . To confirm this in the future however , cell viability measurements such as MTT assays or live / dead fluorescence microscopy assays ( using Hoechst 3342 and propidium iodide ) could be used . Bakkar et al demonstrated that fluorescein uptake is an energy dependent process ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) and previous findings in this thesis indicate that it is in part associated with dynamin - dependent processes ( Chapter 5 ) . Macropinocytosis is also an energy - dependent but dynamin - independent process for the uptake of fluids , and was investigated as an additional biological mechanism of hyperfluorescence . Markedly , in HC cells treated with hyperfluorescence inducing MPS , there was little evidence of macropinocytosis when investigated using FITC - dextran ( Figure 40 ) . These data suggest that fluorescein uptake associated with hyperfluorescence inducing MPS formulations is unrelated to macropinocytosis . This was additionally confirmed in EIPA and fluorescein treated L929 cells ( Figure 41 ) . However , with PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 , formulations associated with low levels of hyperfluorescence , an increase in dextran uptake above the media control was observed ( Figure 40 ) . Together these data suggest that macropinocytosis in this instance is affected by MPS but unrelated to fluorescein uptake . The visualisation and quantification of macropinosomes using fluorescently labelled dextran ( Saeed et al . 2010 ; J . T . H . Wang et al . 2010 ; Soraj et al . 2012 ) has been used to identify macropinocytosis as an important pathway that drives cancer cell proliferation and growth , and has been linked to the oncogene - stimulated internalisation of serum albumin ( Commisso et al . 2013 ; Commisso et al . 2014 ) . In this study , dextran with the molecular weight 10kDa in the forms of FITC - dextran and pHRodo® Red Dextran was used ( Figure 188 40 and Figure 41 respectively ) . There is some literature however that indicates size of dextran fluid - phase markers may influence their endocytic pathway . In particular , it is suggested that 70kDa dextran is a better probe for macropinocytosis whereas 10kDa ( or smaller ) sized dextran are better for general fluid - phase endocytosis ( both micropinocytosis and macropinocytosis ) ( L . Li et al . 2015 ) . However , having observed no change in fluorescein uptake in L929 cells treated with macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA , these data strongly indicate hyperfluorescence is indeed unrelated to this pathway . To build on the findings in this study , in the future larger dextran molecules would be used in these macropinocytosis studies to ensure this specific endocytic pathway was accurately assessed . Furthermore , dextran and fluorescein uptake would be quantified by high content analysis to provide quantitative as well as qualitative information . The relationship of cellular viability and fluorescein uptake in biocide treated murine fibroblasts was next examined . Due to the association of increased clinical staining with PHMB containing MPS however , PHMB has often been implicated as the hyperfluorescence - inducing component in MPS . One study by Bandamwar and colleagues ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) demonstrated hyperfluorescence in human corneal limbal epithelial cells using 0 . 001 % w / v PHMB ( approximately 10 times the concentration typically found in MPS ) . PHMB has also been implicated in inducing hyperfluorescence by an alternative mechanism referred to as the preservative associated transient hyperfluorescence ( PATH ) hypothesis ( Bright et al . 2012 ) . This hypothesis suggests that PHMB adsorbs onto to corneal epithelial surface that mediates a secondary association of fluorescein molecules to the same sites ; the localisation of PHMB / fluorescein complexes on the cell surface is then observed as hyperfluorescence . Bright and colleagues nevertheless also argue that PQ - 1 may mediate fluorescein molecules to the cellular surface in a similar manner ( albeit exhibiting a weaker fluorescein signal than PHMB - 189 mediated fluorescein ) . This is in keeping with reports of clinical hyperfluorescence with PQ - 1 containing MPS formulations by Carnt and colleagues ( Carnt , Willcox , et al . 2007 ) . On investigating the metabolic activity and fluorescein uptake in L929 cell exposed to 0 . 0001 % w / v PQ - 1 ( the concentration in hyperfluorescence inducing MPS P - PQ1 - 1107 ) , the fluorescein intensity was not comparable to the levels of hyperfluorescence seen with P - PQ1 - 1107 ( Figure 44 ) . Similarly , at PHMB concentrations of 0 . 00005 % and 0 . 00013 % w / v , which are found in hyperfluorescence inducing formulations P - 1107 and P - PQ1 - 1107 respectively , fluorescein uptake was not comparable to those demonstrated by P - 1107 and P - PQ1 - 1107 ( Figure 45 ) . Moreover , given that the median fluorescence intensities of 0 . 00005 % and 0 . 00013 % w / v PHMB were very similar to that demonstrated by the carrier control borate buffer , it could be argued that the fluorescence observed is an effect of the carrier control alone . The fluorescein fluorescence intensity data acquired for PHMB and PQ - 1 treated cells at these concentrations are in keeping with our previous findings pertaining to metabolic activity : increased fluorescein uptake , such as that induced by MPS P - PQ1 - 1107 or P - 1107 , is associated with healthy , metabolically active cells . It is also unlikely that PQ - 1 alone is responsible for the minimal fluorescence intensities exhibited with PQ1 - Alex - 904 and PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 . With PQ - 1 concentration 0 . 0003 % w / v , the concentration of PQ - 1 found in MPS PQ1 - Alex - 904 , no fluorescein uptake was observed above the media or carrier control treatments . This is in line with the minimal fluorescence observed clinically with MPS PQ1 - Alex - 904 . However , with a further increase in PQ - 1 concentration to 0 . 001 % , found in MPS formulation PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 also typically associated with minimal hyperfluorescence , the median fluorescence intensity was greater than the carrier control . However a loss of metabolic activity in 0 . 001 % PQ - 1 treated L929 cells , comparable to necrosis inducer BKC , was measured 190 ( Figure 42 ) . These findings are in contrast to our previous work that fluorescein uptake is unrelated to necrosis . This suggests that concentrated solutions of PQ - 1 may utilise unconventional fluorescein uptake mechanisms compared to other MPS components or formulations , similar to the alternative PATH hypothesis . Further investigation into the hyperfluorescence inducing properties of PQ - 1 is required to fully understand its underlying mechanism . Note the metabolic activity of cells measured seen in Figure 42 is not directly comparable to those cells used to quantify fluorescein fluorescence intensities ( seen in Figure 44 ) . To this end , assuming that this concentration of PQ - 1 consistently causes a similar loss of metabolic activity seen in Figure 42 , these findings suggest that high concentrations of PQ - 1 may have greater fluorescein uptake capabilities despite the loss of metabolic activity than all other concentration of PQ - 1 , and indeed PHMB . This is perhaps due to the different interaction mechanisms employed , where PQ - 1 has been shown to intercalate into the biomembrane structure whereas PHMB adsorbs onto the surface ( Horner et al . 2015 ) . The relative extent of cytotoxicity of these biocides against mammalian cells appears uncertain . The cytotoxicity of PHMB - based MPS ReNu® Multi - purpose solution and PQ - 1 based MPS Opti - Free® Express ( amongst other solutions ) on rabbit corneas was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy . Compared to the saline control and compared to all other MPS tested , the ReNu® Multi - purpose solution induced significant physiological changes to the corneal epithelium ( Begley et al . 1994b ) . In contrast , a number of in vitro studies however also report increased toxicity with PQ - 1 based solutions ( McCanna et al . 2008 ; Mowrey - McKee et al . 2002 ; Tchao et al . 2002 ) emphasising the discrepancies in in vitro and in vivo toxicity studies . The effects of biocidal activity of these biocides are nevertheless much clearer . The biocidal activity of PHMB - based MPS are greater than PQ - 1 : a very recent biocidal efficacy study was 191 performed on Gram - negative organisms associated with corneal infiltrative using PHMB - and PQ - 1 - containing MPS . Overall , MPS containing PHMB ( and those containing Alexidine , an alternative biocide found in some MPS formulations ) demonstrated greater biocidal activity than PQ - 1 and MAPD ( myristamidopropyl dimetthylamine ) - based solutions ( Callahan et al . 2017 ) . This is in line with the findings of Groemminger and colleagues whom also report PHMB - based solutions demonstrate greater activity against Staphlacoccus aureus and Fusarium solani than PQ - 1 based solutions ( Groemminger et al . 2007 ) . Metabolic activity measurement could not be performed for cells also being analysed for fluorescein uptake , and this is a limitation of this study . This is due to the design of the fluorescein uptake assay : fluorescein treated cells are repeatedly washed with cold PBS before analysis to reduce fluorescein efflux ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) , and performing a metabolic activity assay after this would not be an accurate representation of cell viability . Live / dead using Hoechst 33342 and PI staining could not be performed using HCA as a bleed - through in the green ( fluorescein ) and red ( PI ) channels had been observed . Furthermore , varying effects on fluorescein uptake were observed with borate buffer treatment , at times exhibiting fluorescence less than the media control as seen in Figure 44 , and other times exhibiting fluorescence more than the media control , seen in Figure 45 . Loss of fluorescein is typically a consequence of the washing step , therefore future work would include optimising this step to reduce the variability in fluorescence intensities measured for borate buffer / fluorescein treated cells . 192 6 . 6 . Conclusions In conclusion , mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is not required for increased fluorescein uptake , and increased hyperfluorescence is unlikely to be a receptor - mediated or macropinocytic process . PHMB and PQ - 1 at low concentrations can cause limited increased hyperfluorescence , though not to the levels apparent after treatment with the hyperfluorescence - inducing MPS formulations P - PQ1 - 1107 or P - 1107 . 193 Chapter 7 Conclusions , Limitations and Future work 194 7 . 1 . Overall conclusions It has long been in practice that fluorescein hyperfluorescence is indicative of poor ocular health . Fluorescein fluorescence intensity itself however is widely known to be affected by concentration ( Romanchuk 1982 ) , although the literature surrounding other variables such as pH and temperature and fluorescein intensity is conflicting and inconsistent . There is also currently little information regarding how fluorescein intensity may affect clinical observations on the ocular surface . Solution induced corneal staining occurs with exposure to certain contact lens / MPS combinations , where increased fluorescence is typically described as a result of MPS toxicity . It is however unclear whether ' MPS toxicity ' is directly related to an increase in fluorescein uptake . The mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon are also unclear . One mechanism increasingly explored is that fluorescein fluoresces from within the cell body , in contrast to the current theories of surface pooling and the ingress model ( Morgan & Maldonado - Codina 2009 ) . A radically alternative theory , known as the PATH ( preservative associated transient hyperfluorescence ) hypothesis , proposes that an increase in hyperfluorescence is mediated by the biocide component of the MPS formulation ( Bright et al . 2012 ) . The hyperfluorescence inducing abilities of individual components however have not been thoroughly investigated . Therefore , the aims of this research were to ( 1 ) to develop a method to quantify fluorescein hyperfluorescence in cell culture , ( 2 ) investigate variables that may affect the fluorescence of fluorescein at time of observation , and determine the concentration of fluorescein available at the ocular surface ( 3 ) identify biological mechanism ( s ) underpinning fluorescein uptake in cell culture and ( 4 ) investigate MPS components for their respective hyperfluorescence inducing abilities . 195 Developing a method to quantify fluorescein hyperfluorescence in cell culture 7 . 1 . 1 . Using high content analysis ( HCA ) the fluorescein uptake in a cell population was quantified per cell as described in Chapter 3 . This method developed to quantify the fluorescein fluorescence builds on the previous work by Bakkar where hyperfluorescence is expressed as a percentage of the total population ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) . Before the study in 2014 by Bakkar and colleagues ( Bakkar et al . 2014 ) , HCA by ArrayScan had not been used for the purpose of fluorescein hyperfluorescence quantification , and fluorescein hyperfluorescence was typically investigated using fluorescence microscopy and pixel intensity quantification . When the latter method was explored as a possible methodology for fluorescein quantification in this thesis , it was found to be inaccurate and time - consuming . Fluorescein quantification by flow cytometry was also explored alongside fluorescein quantification by HCA . As it is unclear however to what extent trypsination ( required to transfer normally adherent cells to the flow cytometer ) affects cellular ability to hyper - fluoresce , an advantage of using HCA to quantify hyperfluorescence is that cells remain attached to the tissue plastic . HCA allows for collection of large quantities of data with minimal subsequent processing of the data collected similar to flow cytometry , reducing human error and increasing throughput . Investigating variables that may affect the fluorescence of fluorescein on the 7 . 1 . 2 . ocular surface As seen in Chapter 4 , variables such as pH and temperature are unlikely to affect the intensity of fluorescence observed on the ocular surface . Notably , MPS formulations of varying surfactant and biocide composition do not affect fluorescein fluorescence intensity , and is comparable to the fluorescence intensity of fluorescein prepared in PBS . Consistent with the literature , fluorescein concentration was identified as the main variable that affects the intensity of fluorescein ( Romanchuk 1982 ) , where concentrations above 0 . 05 % w / v 196 fluorescein in this work exhibited quenching of fluorescence intensity . To investigate the concentration of fluorescein available at the ocular surface at time of observation , a novel method to elucidate the concentration of fluorescein in the tear film was developed . After fluorescein application using a 1 % Minims in 2 subjects , the concentration of fluorescein rapidly decreased over a 10 minute period . Using this instillation method , these data from 2 subjects indicate fluorescence is quenched for at least 1 minute after initial fluorescein instillation . However , this work would benefit from a large clinical study before discussing these findings in a clinical setting . Identifying biological mechanism ( s ) underpinning fluorescein uptake in cell culture 7 . 1 . 3 . Those MPS associated with increased levels of clinical hyperfluorescence , P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 , also exhibited increased fluorescein uptake in both murine fibroblasts and in human corneal cells . Also demonstrated in these two cell lines was the minimal hyperfluorescence of those MPS clinically associated with low levels hyperfluorescence ( PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 ) . Most significantly , increased hyperfluorescence was demonstrated in viable , metabolically active cells only . Notably , the minimal hyperfluorescence exhibited with solutions PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 and PQ1 - Alex - 904 was found to be associated with the loss of cellular metabolic activity . Furthermore , contrary to a recent suggested theory ( Bandamwar et al . 2014 ) , it was also identified that hyperfluorescence is unrelated to apoptosis . With respects to the clinical application and interpretation of hyperfluorescence , this work strongly indicates that the conventional view of ‘hyperfluorescence is indicative of cell death or MPS toxicity’ requires reviewing . The reports that fluorescein uptake is an energy dependent process was also investigated , and was identified as a dynamin - associated process ( Chapter 5 ) . Dynamin is implicated in a number of endocytic pathways responsible for uptake of cargo from the cellular cytoplasm . Dynamin however is typically unrelated to macropinocytosis , an endocytic 197 pathways for bulk - fluid uptake , and was indeed not associated with MPS induced fluorescein uptake when investigated using fluorescently tagged dextran . Interestingly , an increased macropinocytic response to those MPS formulations typically associated with minimal hyperfluorescence , PQ1 - Alex - 904 and PQ1 - Aldox - 1304 , was observed . These data indicate that macropinocytosis is induced on exposure to certain MPS unrelated to increased fluorescein uptake . Not only this , the works in these studies suggest that oxidative phosphorylation is not rate limiting to fluorescein uptake , and that it is also unaffected by serum starvation indicating hyperfluorescence is likely unrelated to receptor mediated endocytosis ( Chapter 6 ) . Investigating MPS components for their respective hyperfluorescence inducing 7 . 1 . 4 . abilities MPS formulations P - PQ1 - 1107 and P - 1107 are both associated with increased hyperfluorescence , and also both comprise of non - ionic surfactant Tetronic 1107 at concentration 1 % w / v . At this concentration , Tetronic 1107 was seen to increase hyperfluorescence in both murine fibroblasts and human corneal cells with minimal effect on cell metabolic activity , seen in Chapter 5 . When PHMB and PQ - 1 were also tested ( in Chapter 6 ) , it was seen that hyperfluorescence increased at low concentrations however not to the extent of those hyperfluorescence inducing MPS P - PQ1 - 1107 or P - 1107 . These data suggest that hyperfluorescence inducing abilities of MPS formulations are most likely an effect of the surfactant component , and not the biocides as previously thought . 7 . 2 . Limitations The background fluorescein intensity often induced saturation in the images taken of the cell population and so this model required washing steps . This introduced variability , which was reduced but not eliminated by controlling the volumes of PBS used to wash the cells . The model is also highly sensitive to temperature and thus all experiments were performed on ice . In the instances of HCA fluorescein quantification , 96 well plates were 198 kept cold by using an ice press on the surface of the plate during analysis reducing the variability introduced by temperature fluctuations . Additionally due to the high - throughput nature of this method , thousands of cells could be analysed rapidly at once further minimising the variability caused by temperature . However , in the instance of fluorescence microscopy cells could not be kept cold when on the microscopy stage . This was a limitation of the microscopy equipment available . A temperature - controlled stage however would help reduce the amount of fluorescence lost over time in the future . Necrosis assays ( using PI ) , and fluorescein uptake assays could not be performed concurrently in the same cell populations due to the overlap in green ( fluorescein ) and red ( PI ) spectrums on the HCA equipment used throughout this work . That is , the cell viability of the cells from which fluorescein fluorescence intensities were recorded could not be measured . Alternatively , MTT assays in parallel to fluorescein quantification assays were regularly performed instead . However , this was also limiting as MTT assay measurements could not be performed of the same cells that were being measured fluorescein uptake . Finally , the borate buffer and the MPS components used in this work were obtained commercially . For example , the PHMB is a Cosmocil 20 % v / v solution , which may not be the same PHMB solution used in our test MPS formulation . The variation in commercially and industrially available MPS components needs further investigation . 7 . 3 . Future work This work has established an in vitro model where the effects of MPS formulations and fluorescein uptake can be studied . Using this in vitro model , investigation of further MPS formulations and MPS components in the future would allow the building of a database that could potentially be used to predict the performance of MPS on the corneal surface . This may be of interest to practitioners and industrial researchers alike . Further 199 development of the model , so as to more closely replicate clinical fluorescein uptake , would see a multi - layer cell model using cells cultured from the cornea , with a working lacrimal component . Additionally , given that not only MPS formulations but also lens materials contribute to SICS , continued development of the model in this work would incorporate lens material into these studies . The GTP - ase dynamin has been found to be associated with fluorescein uptake . However , dynamin is also known to associate with actin filaments , and both are implicated in a number of endocytic pathways . Further investigation into the precise dynamin related mechanisms , and the relationship of such mechanisms with fluorescein uptake , is an area for future work . This could be investigated using a combination of endocytic pathways inhibitors , or by using cellular knockouts of specific mechanisms . Finally , the surfactant Tetronic 1107 was found to be a hyperfluorescence - inducing component . Interactions of this compound and mammalian cells , its absorption into various contact lens materials , and additionally the mechanism behind increased fluorescein uptake induced by Tetronic 1107 is to be next investigated . Furthermore , literature and clinical studies regarding SICS could be re - analysed with these findings in mind : surfactants are likely the hyperfluorescence inducing components in MPS formulations , and not biocides such as PHMB or PQ - 1 . 7 . 4 . Summary The main outcomes of this work were ( 1 ) development of a robust quantitative method that emulates clinical hyperfluorescence in cell culture , ( 2 ) development of a unique method to elucidate the concentration of fluorescein on the ocular surface ( 3 ) correlating those MPS associated with minimal hyperfluorescence with loss of cell viability ( 4 ) identification of dynamin as a protein associated with fluorescein uptake , and ( 5 ) identification of surfactant 200 Tetronic 1107 as the hyperfluorescence inducing component , in contrast to biocides PHMB and PQ - 1 . 201 References Abreau , K . et al . , 2016 .
