Methods : Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) tests were obtained from the Catalan Agency for Quality and Health Assessment . Overall , 7 , 203 , 663 SARS - CoV - 2 tests were performed , of which 491 , 819 were positive ( 6 . 8 % ) . We collected epidemiological data including age - group incidence , diagnostic effort , and positivity rate per 100 , 000 population to analyze the relative results for these epidemiological characteristics . Results : Despite a great diagnostic effort among children , with a difference of 1 , 154 tests per 100 , 000 population in relation to adults , the relative incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 for < 18 years was slightly lower than for the general population , and it increased with the age of the children . Additionally , positivity of SARS - CoV - 2 in children ( 5 . 7 % ) was lower than in adults ( 7 . 2 % ) , especially outside vacation periods , when children were attending school ( 4 . 9 % ) . Conclusions : A great diagnostic effort , including mass screening and systematic whole - group contact tracing when a positive was detected in the class group , was associated with childhood SARS - CoV - 2 incidence and lower positivity rate in the 2020 - 2021 school year . Schools have been a key tool in epidemiological surveillance rather than being drivers of SARS - CoV - 2 incidence in Catalonia , Spain .

Schools for Childhood COVID - 19 Surveillance INTRODUCTION On 13 th March 2020 , the government of Catalonia , Spain , ordered the closure of schools in an eﬀort to contain the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) ( 1 ) . A total of 1 , 565 , 478 students from 5 , 492 Catalonian schools were forced to remain at home during the ﬁrst pandemic wave , and the schools were not reopened until the beginning of the 2020 - 2021 academic year on 14 th September 2020 . Non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) , following the protocol launched by the Department of Education of the Catalonian Government ( 2 ) , were implemented in the educational setting from the beginning of the school year : hand - washing , mandatory mask use for children older than 5 , social distancing , organization of children and teachers into bubble groups whenever possible in order to maintain , as far as possible , the same groups of individuals to facilitate contact tracing , and enhanced ventilation in the classroom by keeping doors and windows open , along with other public health practices , such as screening and quarantine the whole group whenever a positive was detected . In fact , it has been demonstrated that all of these measures are essential to mitigate the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in schools ( 3 – 7 ) . However , clusters of SARS - CoV - 2 infection have been detected in any number of educational centers . Although educators seemed to play a central role in in - school transmission networks ( 8 ) , the role of the schools in the SARS - CoV - 2 transmission among children ( 9 ) , and the impact of the school closures on children and their parents ( 10 , 11 ) , remain at the center of public debate worldwide . In fact , closing schools interrupts learning and has a signiﬁcant negative impact on society as a whole and on children’s health and well - being , potentially leading to inequity issues and a loss of years of life ( 12 ) . The incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections in educational settings seems to be a reﬂection of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission at the community level ( 13 , 14 ) . A study performed in Canada comparing school - related cases and outbreaks of COVID - 19 to those in the general population detected more than seventy school clusters , but the weekly incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in the schools was always lower than the incidence in the whole population , and the authors concluded that schools were not a signiﬁcant driver of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission ( 15 ) , mainly when compared to households ( 16 ) . Additionally , a recent study suggests that children in the age - group of 0 - 9 years do not have substantial rates of SARS - CoV - 2 infection during school attendance and are unlikely to play a substantial role in the spread of the infection ( 17 ) . Hence , to measure the role of schools in COVID - 19 transmission , we examined and analyzed the childhood ( < 18 years of age ) COVID - 19 incidence in Catalonia ( Spain ) during the ﬁrst 36 weeks of the 2020 - 2021 school - year ( 14 th September - 31 st May ) , including Christmas ( 22 nd December - 10 th January ) and Easter ( 29 th March - 5 th April ) holidays , in comparison to the incidence of COVID - 19 in adults . METHODS Data Description Catalonia is an autonomous region in north - eastern Spain with 7 , 653 , 845 inhabitants ( 1 , 384 , 382 under 18 years of age ) . We obtained public data on the total tested and conﬁrmed SARS - CoV - 2 cases in Catalonia , provided by the Catalan Agency for Quality and Health Assessment ( AQuAS ) that had downloaded the original data from the Catalan Epidemiological Surveillance Network’s clinical microbiological laboratories ( 18 ) . No additional data were available . A conﬁrmed COVID - 19 case was deﬁned as any individual testing SARS - CoV - 2 positive by molecular assays [ polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) or transcription - mediated ampliﬁcation ( TMA ) ] or rapid antigen testing ( RAT ) ( PANBIO COVID - 19 by ABBOTT© ) in a respiratory specimen which has a sensitivity of 98 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 93 . 2 – 99 . 8 % ) and a speciﬁcity of 99 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 98 . 6 – 100 . 0 % ) in symptomatic patients , according to the company information . RAT has only been available since 23 rd October 2020 ( 7th week of the school - course ) in primary care settings . All the close contacts of the conﬁrmed cases were tested , mainly with PCR . Nevertheless , in the schools , all the classroom contacts were tested by PCR and not by RAT . This study used aggregated public health data from the health surveillance system to investigate the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 among children . No personal or identiﬁable data were collected ; thus , the institutional research board waived the requirement for parental and / or patient informed consent . This information was critical for supporting health - policy recommendations on easing COVID - 19 lockdown measures and allowing children to return to school safely . This was identiﬁed as a public health priority and as part of the public health response to the COVID - 19 pandemic in Catalonia . The results have been used to provide an evidence base for informing national guidance and public health policy to help protect children and staﬀ in educational settings . Data Analysis In Spain , the educational system for those under 18 years has four educational levels . A ﬁrst non - compulsory stage that corresponds to nursery education ( 0 – 5 years ) is divided into two cycles , kindergarten ( 0 – 3 years ) and pre - school ( 3 – 5 years ) . The second stage is the elementary education ( 6 – 11 years ) , which is compulsory , and it is followed by secondary education ( 12 – 16 years ) . The fourth stage is non - compulsory and comprises the high - school education ( 16 – 18 years ) , intermediate vocational training , intermediate professional plastic arts and design courses , and intermediate sports courses ( 19 ) . According to these stages , and including adults as an independent control group , we focused our research on age - group incidence ( cases per 10 5 population ) , diagnostic eﬀort ( tests per 10 5 population ) , and positivity , deﬁned as the quotient between positive SARS - CoV - 2 tests ( cases ) and the total of SARS - CoV - 2 tests performed , given as a percentage : Frontiers in Pediatrics | www . frontiersin . org 2 September 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 754744 Perramon et al . Schools for Childhood COVID - 19 Surveillance positivity ( % ) = number of conﬁrmed cases / number of tests performed ( 1 ) If an individual was tested at diﬀerent times for the same clinical episode , delimited by the maximum incubation period for the SARS - CoV - 2 infection , we deﬁned the following dates : when all the tests were negative , we considered the date of the ﬁrst test performed in the clinical episode ; and when a test was positive , we relied on the date of that test regardless of the previous negative results in the same episode . Each episode counted once to analyze the dynamics of the epidemic . For each of the variables ( i . e . , incidence , diagnostic eﬀort , and positivity ) and age - groups , we assessed its relative value with regards to that of the general population . These relative variables allow for a rapid identiﬁcation of those values above the average ( < 1 ) and those below ( < 1 ) . In addition , we performed a one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) test to explore diﬀerences in the number of the diagnostic tests performed per 10 5 population , incidence of cases ( cases per 10 5 population ) , and positivity between the diﬀerent age - groups . The one - way ANOVA returns the p - value for a group of data . It tests the hypothesis that the diﬀerent samples tested are drawn from populations with the same mean . A p - value below 0 . 05 indicates that the hypothesis is rejected with a 95 % signiﬁcance level . Holidays and school periods were shared by children of all educational stages until higher education ( 20 ) . The vacation periods considered for testing were between 21 st December 2021 and 10 th January 2021 for Christmas , and between 27 th March and 5 th April 2021 for Easter holidays . To analyze the infections associated with the school - closure periods for holidays , and considering an average period of 7 days between the infection and the diagnosis ( approximately 5 days until symptoms onset and 2 days from symptoms onset to the doctor’s appointment in Catalonia ) ( 21 , 22 ) , the incidence and positivity were deﬁned between 28 th December 2020 ( i . e . , one week after the beginning of the Christmas holidays ) and 17 th January 2021 ( i . e . , one week after returning to school ) . For the Easter holidays this period was deﬁned as between 3 rd and 12 th April 2021 . Epidemiological Context Schools re - opened in Catalonia on 14 th September 2020 after a long closure period , starting 13 th March 2020 . This reopening occurred in a context in which the average 14 - day cumulative incidence was around 180 – 190 cases per 10 5 population , and the most prevalent SARS - CoV - 2 Pangolin lineage was B . 1 . 177 with other minor lineages . To mitigate the risk of transmission , a set of NPIs was established : ( 1 ) face masks were mandatory in all educational centers for children older than 5 , ( 2 ) natural ventilation and hand hygiene in the classrooms and common spaces were recommended , ( 3 ) infants and adolescents were clustered into bubble - groups ( mainly restricted to classmates ) in all educational centers with no interactions with other groups in the center , and ( 4 ) whenever a positive case was detected , the whole group was screened and , whatever the result of the SARS - CoV - 2 tests , the whole group was quarantined for 10 days . In addition , several mass screening campaigns were carried out in educational centers located in high incidence areas . Furthermore , during the analyzed period , the regional government introduced other community NPIs to reduce the global incidence of COVID - 19 , as shown in Supplementary Table 1 ( 23 ) . Eventually , on 9 th May 2021 , the Spanish Government relaxed some of the previous interventions and allowed mobility throughout the country . RESULTS Diagnostic Effort During the study period , 1 , 654 , 099 SARS - CoV - 2 tests were performed in the population < 18 years , representing 1 . 2 tests per person , and 91 , 857 of them were positive ( 5 . 5 % ) . RAT was used for testing in the 34 . 4 % of the 0 – 5 year - old children , 20 . 2 % of the 6 – 11 y - old , and 19 . 6 % of 12 – 17 y - old . Furthermore , 5 , 554 , 060 SARS - CoV - 2 tests were performed in the adult population , representing less than one test performed per person ( 0 . 9 ) , and 400 , 506 of them were positive ( 7 . 2 % ) . The diagnostic eﬀort during the analyzed period was generally greater in children than in adults ( yellow and black lines in Figure 1A , respectively ) , with a diﬀerence of 1 , 335 tests per 10 5 population between children and adults . For the three diﬀerent waves of the pandemic occurring since mid - September 2020 ( weeks of the school - year : 1 – 11 , 14 – 24 , and 26 - 35 ) , the mean children / adults test ratios per 10 5 population per week were : 1 . 87 ( 3 , 910 / 2 , 086 ) , 0 . 97 ( 3 , 228 / 3 , 326 ) , and 1 . 63 ( 2 , 995 / 1 , 839 ) , respectively . However , this diagnostic eﬀort largely varied , especially among children , during the study period ( see Figure 1A ) . Apart from vacation time , the diagnostic eﬀort was clearly greater in all the children’s age groups , particularly for the 12 – 17 years old with a mean of 4 , 925 tests per 10 5 population ( light blue line of Figure 1A ) vs . 2 , 355 tests per 10 5 population for adults . Only during 14 weeks of the study period ( between week 11 and 23 , and during week 30 ) was the diagnostic eﬀort among the 0 - 5 years - old lower than for the adults , with a mean of − 1 , 051 tests per 10 5 population . Four of these 14 weeks were holidays . At Christmas ( approximately weeks 15 – 17 ) , tests were mainly performed on adults , with this the period having the lowest number of tests for children , and yielding a mean diﬀerence of − 806 tests per 10 5 population compared to adults . Age - Group Incidence Sars - CoV - 2 incidence in children was slightly higher than the incidence in adults for most of the study - period , with a mean diﬀerence of 21 cases per 10 5 population ( yellow and black lines in Figure 1B , respectively ) . This diﬀerence was above the mean during the third wave ( weeks 30 – 34 ) , with a diﬀerence of 27 cases per 10 5 population . However , during these weeks , just after the Easter holidays , the diagnostic eﬀort diﬀerence between children and adults was higher , as shown in Figure 1A ( a mean diﬀerence of 1154 tests per 10 5 population between children and adults in this period ) . SARS - CoV - 2 incidence was directly associated with the age of the children : averages of 248 , 175 , and 118 cases per 10 5 population for the group of 12 – 17 , 6 – 11 , and 0 – 5 years old , respectively , for the study - period . Otherwise , the evolution of incidence for all age - groups followed a similar pattern .

Holiday periods are marked in gray . A 7 - day running average was calculated . Relative Diagnostic Effort and Incidence Among the Childhood Age Groups Figure 2 shows that relative values of tests per 10 5 population among children with respect to the value among the general population were higher compared to the adult relative values during the entire period ( mean diﬀerence of 0 . 37 ) , except during weeks 12 - 18 . In fact , relative diagnostic eﬀort among children was almost twice that among adults ( means 1 . 61 / 0 . 86 ) in the ﬁrst 11 weeks of the school year . Older children ( 12 - 17 years ) were the most tested age - group ( mean of 1 . 9 relative diagnostic eﬀort ) in contrast to pre - school children ( 1 . 1 ) , children in elementary school ( 1 . 3 ) , and adults ( 0 . 9 ) . However , during holiday periods these ﬁgures were completely diﬀerent , with an average of 1 . 03 relative diagnostic eﬀort in the group of 12 – 17 , compared to 0 . 62 , 0 . 66 , and 1 . 05 for children aged 0 – 5 , 6 – 11 , and adults , respectively . Regarding the relative SARS - CoV - 2 incidence ( Figure 2B ) , this was slightly higher in children than in adults with a mean diﬀerence of 0 . 15 , except during the holiday periods ( − 0 . 19 relative incidence ) . Adolescents ( 12 – 17 years ) had the highest relative incidence throughout the study period , with , on average , 1 . 5 and 1 . 1 relative values for the school period and holidays , respectively . Among children of less than 5 years of age , Frontiers in Pediatrics | www . frontiersin . org 4 September 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 754744 Perramon et al .

Line colors correspond to : kindergarten and pre - school children ( 0 – 5 , green ) , elementary school children ( 6 – 11 , red ) , secondary school children ( 12 – 17 , blue ) , adults ( black ) , and the average for all children ( yellow ) . For each age group , the variables are presented relative to the general population ( i . e . , value in the age group divided by the value in the general population ) . Holiday periods are marked with gray bands . despite the higher relative diagnostic eﬀort , with a mean of 1 , incidence was clearly lower than for the general population ( on average , 0 . 69 relative incidence ) . Positivity Rate During the ﬁrst 11 weeks of the school year , positivity among children ( yellow line ) remained clearly below the positivity among adults ( black line ) , with percentages around 5 % or even lower for younger children . This indicates , at least in part , that the higher incidence for the 12 – 17 years - old age group could be explained by a greater eﬀort at diagnosis . In contrast , after a long weekend ( week 12 ) and during the Christmas holidays ( weeks 15 - 17 ) , the positivity rate for all childhood age groups increased substantially , as shown in Figure 3 , because of a lower diagnosis eﬀort ( see Figures 1A , 2A ) .

Schools for Childhood COVID - 19 Surveillance population during the entire study period and separating school periods and holidays . Even though the relative number of daily tests among children was signiﬁcantly higher ( p < 0 . 001 ) than among adults during the study period ( Figure 4A , with a mean value of 1 . 19 and 0 . 96 for < 18 years and adults , respectively ) , the relative incidence presented similar values , being on average 1 . 03 for children and 0 . 99 for adults ( Figure 4B ) . As a consequence , positivity was lower ( p < 0 . 001 ) among children ( Figure 4C , with a mean of 0 . 94 and 1 . 04 for < 18 years and adults , respectively ) . We also analyzed separately the school period and the holidays and diﬀerent age - groups among children . Relative tests decreased considerably for all the children’s age groups when the schools were closed ( mean values for school period / holidays : 0 . 97 / 0 . 67 , 1 . 09 / 0 . 69 , 1 . 62 / 0 . 99 for 0 – 5 , 6 – 11 , 12 – 17 years , respectively ) , but this was not observed in the adults , who had a similar relative number of tests in the two periods ( 0 . 95 / 1 . 05 , Figures 4D , G ) . On the other hand , there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence ( p < 0 . 001 ) between the tests performed within the diﬀerent age groups during the school period , except for children 0 – 5 years old when compared to adults ( p = 0 . 37 ) . In contrast , during the holidays , there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence ( p < 0 . 001 ) between the tests performed within the diﬀerent age groups during the school period , except for children aged 0 – 5 compared to children 6 – 11 years old ( p = 0 . 83 ) , and for older children ( 12 – 17 years ) in comparison to adults ( p = 0 . 45 ) . Moreover , the relative incidence among children increased considerably with the age of the cohort in both analyzed periods , being clearly lower than that observed in adults ( mean values 0 . 97 and 1 . 05 in average during the school period and holidays , respectively ) among kindergarten children ( 0 . 70 and 0 . 55 , Figures 4E , H ) . Evidently , during the holidays , the lower number of tests performed substantially decreased the relative incidence among children . Furthermore , it is noteworthy that incidence within diﬀerent age groups during the school period was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent ( p < 0 . 005 ) . Nevertheless , performing the same analysis for the holidays , children aged 12 – 17 showed a non - signiﬁcant diﬀerence when compared to adults ( p = 0 . 2 ) . Finally , relative positivity was smaller for all the children’s age groups when compared to the relative positivity among adults during the school period ( averages of 0 . 76 , 0 . 98 , 0 . 91 , 1 . 05 for each age group represented in Figure 4F from left to right ) , but it was clearly higher among children when the schools were closed ( 1 . 09 , 1 . 49 , 1 . 28 , 0 . 97 ) mainly due to a decrease in the diagnostic eﬀort ( Figure 4I ) . It is of note that , during both the school period and holidays , positivity in all groups diﬀered from each other signiﬁcantly ( p < 0 . 001 ) . DISCUSSION This study shows that , while schools were opened and NPIs were implemented according to the protocol published by the Department of Education of the Catalonian Government ( 2 ) , COVID - 19 incidence among children was similar to that for the adults , but higher among adolescents . However , childhood positivity for SARS - CoV - 2 always remained lower due to the greater diagnostic eﬀort , with the systematic testing of whole groups after detection of a positive case and several mass screening campaigns in educational settings . In fact , given the typical mild course of the SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children , with a high percentage of asymptomatic cases , the results of this study show the importance of systematic screening in schools whenever a positive case is reported . The huge increase in SARS - CoV - 2 positivity among children during the holidays in comparison with adults is clearly associated with a signiﬁcant under - diagnosis of pediatric cases during these periods . In contrast , the lower positivity during school periods , with values closer to the objectives of the World Health Organization of 5 % , highlights the increase in the diagnostic rate among children biasing their global incidence . The mean child - adult SARS - CoV - 2 incidence ratio was , for the three waves of the pandemic in Catalonia , 1 . 05 , 0 . 98 , and 1 . 25 ( see Supplementary Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material ) , respectively . However , if the same diagnostic eﬀort were assumed for all the age groups by considering that any positivity rate higher than 5 % denotes an under - diagnosis proportional to the distance of the positivity to this baseline ( 24 ) , the ratio for the three waves would have been 0 . 61 , 1 . 01 and 0 . 97 , respectively . Thus , the incidence among children was in general lower than for adults and only in the second wave , after the Christmas holidays , was the incidence slightly higher . Moreover , there are clear diﬀerences in the incidence in children attending kindergarten or elementary schools ( 0 – 11 years ) , and adolescents in secondary / high schools ( 12 – 17 years ) ( 10 , 25 ) . Positivity rates per age group suggest that the former group did not play a signiﬁcant role in SARS - CoV - 2 dissemination in Catalonia probably due to their lower susceptibility to the virus and lesser capacity to transmit it ( 3 ) . These diﬀerences between younger children and teenagers have also been observed elsewhere ( 9 , 10 , 26 , 27 ) , also recently in our setting ( 28 ) . Regarding the inﬂuence of Spain’s COVID - 19 vaccine rollout , adult vaccination started on the 27 th of December 2021 , and the coverage ( full vaccination ) went from 0 . 84 % at the end of January 2021 to 17 . 53 % at the end of the study period ( see Supplementary Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material ) . Considering the age < 69 years , which is the age - group of active employees , only 5 . 45 % were fully vaccinated by the end of May 2021 , while 23 . 52 % had received at least the ﬁrst dose of a vaccine . Moreover , essential workers , such as teachers and staﬀ working in educational centers , were vaccinated with the Oxford / AstraZeneca© vaccine with a scheduled interval of 12 weeks between the ﬁrst and the second dose . In particular , in Catalonia , the second dose of the vaccine began to be administered to essential workers on 27 th May 2021 ( 29 ) . Therefore , considering the rollout procedure , the incidence among children during the last part of the analyzed period was probably not aﬀected by the vaccination of teachers and other school workers . At school week 16 , the ﬁrst SARS - CoV - 2 cases related to the B . 1 . 1 . 7 lineage ( Alpha variant ) ( 30 ) were detected in Catalonia , co - circulating then with the more prevalent B . 1 . 177 lineage . The prevalence of the Alpha variant increased to 17 % by week 22 ( 31 ) . At week 34 , the ﬁrst cases caused by the more Frontiers in Pediatrics | www . frontiersin . org 7 September 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 754744 Perramon et al . Schools for Childhood COVID - 19 Surveillance transmissible B . 1 . 617 . 2 lineage ( Delta variant ) were detected , and the percentage of this variant among randomly selected positive samples reached 10 – 20 % in the last week of this study period ( 30 th May 2021 ) ( 32 ) . Since the novel SARS - CoV - 2 variants seem to be characterized by greater transmissibility and have become the most prevalent viruses ( 11 ) , schools are a perfect scenario for monitoring the pandemic among children and key to initiating contact - tracing studies among students’ families . In this sense , these studies should yield improved understanding of the rates of secondary cases after a child is found positive in a class . We did not detect any signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the last weeks of the study period regarding the presence of these more transmissible genetic variants with the incidence and positivity of SARS - CoV - 2 . However , relative incidence was much higher in adolescents than in previous weeks , but this fact was directly associated with the greater diagnostic eﬀort in the last weeks of the analyzed period , as shown in Figure 2 . Our study has some notable strengths . Firstly , this is a population - based study with data provided by the AQuAS , which downloaded them from the reference Catalan Epidemiological Surveillance Network of all the clinical microbiological laboratories of the region . Secondly , we combined three epidemiological characteristics to improve interpretation of the evolution of the childhood COVID - 19 pandemic during the school year , and to collect not only the symptomatic cases but also to be able to detect the asymptomatic children with SARS - CoV - 2 infection diagnosed through systematic whole - group testing after detection of a positive case , reinforced with several mass screening campaigns in the schools . And ﬁnally , we analyzed our results according to the school stages and holiday periods to permit us to diﬀerentiate the epidemiological characteristics for diﬀerent scenarios both in the school and at home . In fact , this analysis could help to improve public health policies in the future of the pandemic . However , our study has some limitations . Firstly , we do not know the percentage of asymptomatic children in the study period . Nevertheless , we found a correlation ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) between diagnostic eﬀort and positivity because of the testing protocols in the schools : the greater the diagnostic eﬀort , the lower the positivity . Secondly , we do not know the exact percentage of students and teachers who strictly followed the NPIs at each educational center . Thirdly , we cannot disaggregate the eﬀect of NPI measures implemented in the community which could aﬀect the dynamics of adults and children in a diﬀerent manner and that were not constant throughout the course . Nevertheless , the epidemiological diﬀerences between children and adults in scholar vs . holiday periods reported in this study are expected to be mainly caused by whether the schools were open or not in these two periods . Fourthly , as described before , the percentage of younger children ( under 5 ) tested by RAT was higher than in older age - groups . This is likely because they were mostly tested out of the school contact tracing studies , and therefore incidence in this age - group could be underestimated . Finally , childhood SARS - CoV - 2 incidence during the school year has not been demonstrated to be a determining factor in the levels of community transmission , but mitigation measures , mainly NPIs applied at the educational centers , could have been crucial to obtaining such a favorable outcome . Studies of the seroprevalence of IgG against SARS - CoV - 2 in school personnel and students have been published , together with information from their partners , to determine whether the prevention measures applied in the centers were eﬀective in controlling transmission . These studies did not detect SARS - CoV - 2 infections in children attending day - care during the onset of the second wave of the pandemic ( 5 ) . The same conclusions were obtained in other studies carried out in Luxembourg ( 13 ) and in the United States ( 4 ) , in which prevention measures were used to prevent transmission in educational centers . In fact , outbreaks of COVID - 19 in educational settings seem rare , and the incidence of infections in these centers reﬂects that of the general population at the community level ( 33 ) . Another example of a multicenter seroprevalence study conducted in schools , in France , also demonstrated that SARS - CoV - 2 seropositive children were more likely than seronegative children to have been exposed to a laboratory - conﬁrmed COVID - 19 living adult , suggesting that intrafamily transmission was more plausible than transmission within daycare centers ( 34 ) . However , the appearance of new genetic variants of SARS - CoV - 2 , such as the alpha variant which was ﬁrstly detected in the United Kingdom , has shown that they have greater transmissibility in all age groups , but without being associated with higher mortality ( 30 ) . In a recent article , three childhood education centers with SARS - CoV - 2 variant B . 1 . 1 . 7 and related domestic outbreaks were investigated . Despite the creation of bubble groups to control transmission , the cases occurred in almost all groups , and also among people without close contact . The secondary attack rates for children were similar to those for adults ( 35 ) . In conclusion , this study shows that due to the screening campaigns and NPI measures implemented , schools have been a key tool in epidemiological surveillance , and not drivers of the SARS - CoV - 2 incidence , in Catalonia , Spain . In addition , they have been a crucial element for the detection of cases in an age - group population with a higher percentage of asymptomatic cases .
