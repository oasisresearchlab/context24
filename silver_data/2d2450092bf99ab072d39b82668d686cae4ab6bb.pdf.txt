Keywords : equine , oocyte maturation , equine growth hormone , cytoskeleton distribution Implications As successful in vitro fertilization has not yet been well established in horses , efﬁcient techniques for invitrooocyte maturation are crucial to deﬁne culture conditions that pro - mote oocyte maturation competence and to provide new strategies to improve the efﬁciency of assisted reproductive technologies ( ART ) in horses . This study emphasizes the importance of using equine growth hormone to mature equine oocytes invitro and its important role on the cytos - keleton distribution that may accelerate advances in ART . It also provides strong evidences of a potential role of eGH in reproductive function for oocyte development procedures invitroin horses . Introduction In horses , invitromaturation ( IVM ) rates of equine oocytes differ between laboratories ; this may be partially owing to inappropriate methods for oocyte selection , poor in vitro culture conditions or both ( Hinrichs and Williams , 1997 ; Hinrichs , 2010 ) . In addition , there is limited information regarding developmental competence and speciﬁc require - ments during IVM of equine oocytes recovered from abattoir - derived ovaries ( Dell’Aquila etal . , 1997 ) . - E - mail : gabriel . pereira @ ufpel . edu . br , gpereira @ ucdavis . edu 1493 Growth hormone ( GH ) , an important regulator of female reproduction in mammals , plays an important role in ovarian function , follicular growth and steroidogenesis ( Hull and Harvey , 2001 ) . Recently , Shirazi etal . ( 2010 ) reported a positive effect of GH added invitroto mature ovine oocyte that resulted in 73 % of hatched blastocyst development . Insulin - like growth factor - I ( IGF - I ) has also been known for stimulating oocyte maturation and promoting blastocyst development in several species , such as rabbits ( Yoshimuraetal . , 1994 ) , bovine ( Matsui etal . , 1995 ) and sheep ( Guler etal . , 2000 ) ; therefore , those ﬁndings demonstrated that IGF - I is critical for embryo culture . In horses , IGF - I is known to promote nuclear and cytoplasm maturation of invitromatured equine oocytes ( Carneiro etal . , 2002 ) . The interaction between GH and IGF - I is important , as IGF - I has been shown to play an important role in ovarian function in humans and animal models ( Erickson etal . , 1989 ) . Studies in our laboratory demonstrated that more equine oocytes resumed meiosis in the presence of eGH and IGF - I in the IVM system after 30 h of culture in serum - free culture medium ( Pereira etal . , 2006 and 2012 ) . Reports of horse oocyte development have focused on evaluating changes in chromatin conﬁguration ( Hinrichs etal . , 1993 ; Siddiqui etal . , 2009 ) , mitochondrial organiza - tion ( Torner etal . , 2007 ) , as well as nuclear and cytoplasmic changes during oocyte maturation ( Carneiro et al . , 2002 ) . However , there is limited evidence on whether cytoskeleton distribution remains intact after IVM of equine oocytes cul - tured with additional growth factors . In fact , the number of in vitro matured equine oocytes used to evaluate oocyte development and organelle distribution is so minimal that it is difﬁcult to determine oocyte integrity and viability using various treatment groups as an experimental design . In most studies , maturation rates have been based on the number of oocytes that developed to metaphase II ( M - II ; Choi etal . , 2002 ; Hinrichs etal . , 2005 ) . Assessments of the migration of cortical granules , formation of meiotic spindle and integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane have been used as indicators of oocyte maturity and integrity ( Tremoleda et al . , 2001 ; Carneiro et al . , 2002 ; Siddiqui et al . , 2009 ) . However , for an oocyte to achieve maturity , none of these parameters alone is a true indicator of oocyte competence for fertilization . To the best of our knowledge , there are no reports on the cytoskeleton structure of equine oocytes after the addition in vitro of eGH and its interaction with IGF - I , gonadotropins ( FSH and LH ) , estradiol ( E 2 ) and fetal calf serum ( FCS ) . We hypothesize that the limited success achieved with IVM of horse oocytes is partly because of abnormalities asso - ciated with cytoskeleton structures , which inﬂuence cell viability and fertilization potential . The main objective of this research was to investigate the effects of eGH and its interaction with IGF - I , gonadotropins , E 2 and FCS on the integrity of cytoskeletal organization following IVM . Materials and methods This experiment was conducted in the Southern Brazil ( latitude 27 8 28 0 S , longitude 51 8 55 0 W ) , from November to December , during the physiological breeding season . All chemicals used were purchased from Sigma Chemicals Company , St . Louis , MO , USA , unless otherwise indicated in the text . Collectionofcumulus – oocytecomplexes ( COCs ) Fresh equine ovaries were obtained from a slaughterhouse located 20 min from EMBRAPA Research Center , RS , Brazil , and immediately transported in warmed saline solution to the laboratory in an insulated container at 25 8 C to 30 8 C . A total of 144 ovaries were used to conduct this study , and the interval between ovary collection from the slaughter - house and retrieval of COCs ranged from 2 to 4 h . Tunica albuginea from the ovaries selected for oocyte aspiration were stripped and follicular ﬂuid from each follicle , 30 mm in dia - meter was aspirated with an 18 G needle connected to a 35 - ml syringe . After 20 min of sedimentation , the pellet was collected using a Pasteur pipette and placed into 100 - mm Petri dishes . All recovered COCs were evaluated for their morphology and structural integrity using a dissecting stereomicroscope and classiﬁed as being compact ( having a tight , complete compact multilayer of cumulus cells ) , expanded ( having granular or expanded layers of cumulus cells ) and partially or completely denuded ( having a partial or no cumulus cells , or only corona radiata , surrounding the oocytes ; Hinrichs and Williams , 1997 ) . We decided to use only compact COCs with homogeneous cytoplasm having a lower mitotic competence in comparison with expanded oocytes , we used only compact COCs in this experiment to test whether different supple - mentation of maturation media would be effective in improving the maturation rate of equine oocytes invitro . CultureofCOCsTheCOCsintended for incubation with maturation media were randomly allocated to each treatment group ( , 8 to 12 COCs per group ) . eGH ( NHPP ; Harbor - UCLA , CA , USA ) was diluted in tissue culture media - 199 ( TCM - 199 ) and used at a concentration of 400 ng / ml ( Pereira etal . , 2012 ) for invitro procedures . IGF - I was also diluted in TCM - 199 and used at 200 ng / ml , in accordance with a study by Carneiro et al . ( 2001 ) . Base medium was composed of TCM - 199 , 1 mg / ml bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , 100 IU / ml penicillin G and 50 m g / ml streptomycin sulfate . The medium was ﬁltered through a 0 . 22 m m pore diameter ﬁlter into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and allowed to equilibrate for at least 1 h under 5 % CO 2 in air before being used as the base culture medium . The COCs were washed four times in maturation medium before culture . This study comprised two experiments as described below . Both experiments undergoing IVM were cultured for 30 h at 38 . 5 8 C in air with 5 % CO 2 , as described below . Experiment1 : EffectofeGHandIGF - IonequineCOCs COCs were cultured for 30 h and randomly assigned to one of ﬁve experimental groups as follows : ( 1 ) base medium ( control ) ; ( 2 ) 400 ng / ml eGH ; ( 3 ) 200 ng / ml IGF - I ; ( 4 ) 400 ng / ml eGH 1 200 ng / ml IGF - I ; and ( 5 ) eGH 1 200 ng / ml IGF - I and 200 ng / ml anti - IGF - I ( GR11T ; Calbiochem , San Diego , CA , USA ) antibody . We decided to investigate the effect of eGH using Pereira , Lorenzo , Carneiro , Ball , Pegoraro , Pimentel and Liu 1494 neutralizing anti - IGF - 1 antibodies in the presence of IGF - I to rule out any toxic effect on their interactions . This ﬁrst experiment was replicated six times . Experiment2 : EffectofeGH , E 2 , FSH , LHandFCSon equineCOCsEquineCOCs were randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups : ( 1 ) base medium ( control ) ; ( 2 ) eGH ; ( 3 ) eGH 1 1 mg / ml E 2 , 5 IU / ml porcine FSH ( Catalogue # 915 ; Sioux Biochemical Inc . , Sioux Center , IA , USA ) , 10 IU / ml of equine LH , and 100 mg / ml heat - inactivated FCS ; and ( 4 ) eGH 1 FSH 1 LH 1 FCS at the same concentration cited above . The second experiment was replicated ﬁve times . OocyteprocessingandstainingAfterIVM , cumulus cells were removed with 1 % hyaluronidase in DPBS - w / o solution for 1 min and mechanically stripped with a microcapillary glass pipette . Oocytes were permeabilized by treatment with medium M ( 0 . 5M PIPES , 25 mM magnesium chloride , 0 . 01 % aprotinin , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 50 % deuterium oxide , 1 mM taxol and 0 . 1 % Triton - X - 100 in DPBS - w / o ) , a gly - cerol - based microtubule - stabilizing solution for 1 h at 39 8 C and ﬁxed in 2 % solution of paraformaldehyde in PBS - w / o . After ﬁxation , they were maintained in paraformaldehyde at 4 8 C for 2 days and stored in blocking solution ( 0 . 2 % of sodium azide , 1 mg / ml of polyvinyl alcohol and 100 mM of glycine in PBS - w / o ) until immunoﬂuorescent staining . Microﬁlaments , microtubules and chromatin assessment were evaluated as described ( Tremoleda etal . , 2001 ) , with some modiﬁcations as given below . Microtubules were labeled ﬁrst by incubating the oocytes with a primary anti - body against microtubules ( dilution 1 : 250 , monoclonal anti - a - tubulin , Sigma ; T - 5168 ) for 90 min at 37 8 C . Then , oocytes were washed three times in a PBS containing 1 % Triton - X - 100 in DPBS - w / o and 5 mg / ml BSA before being incubated for 1 h in block solution . Next , oocytes were exposed to a secondary antibody conjugated with AlexaFluor 555 ( dilution 1 : 250 , goat anti - mouse IgG ( # A21422 ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) ) for 1 h at 37 8 C . Microﬁlaments were stained by oocyte incubation with AlexaFluor 488 Phalloidin ( 15 IU / ml , goat anti - mouse IgG 1 ( # A21121 ; Molecular Probes ) ) for 1 h at 37 8 C . Finally , to enable chro - matin visualization , oocytes were evaluated by counter - staining with TO - PRO 3 - iodide ( 1 m g / ml ( # T3605 ; Molecular Probes ) ) for 15 min at 37 8 C . Each step of immunolabeling of equine oocytes was performed in a dark chamber and followed by washing for 1 h in block solution . After immunostaining , oocytes were placed on glass microscope slides with a space between the coverslip , ﬁlled with 25 m l drop of antifade mounting medium ( # H1300 ; Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA , USA ) and sealed with clear ﬁngernail polish . Laser - scanning confocal microscopy was performed using a Bio - Rad MRC 1024 ES equipped with a Krypton – argon ion laser . Laser - scanning microscope equipped with three excitation ﬁlter sets of 488 / 555 / 650 nm were engaged simultaneously to excite AlexaFluor 488 Phalloidin , AlexaFluor 555 and TO - PRO - 3 iodide ( 650 nm ) for visualization of microﬁlaments , microtubules and chromatin detection , respectively . Each oocyte was fully observed with optical sections of 0 . 1 to 2 . 0 m m intervals . InterpretationofresultsDescriptiveanalysesofcytoskeleton integrity were used to determine the oocyte maturation rate upon culture condition as described earlier in the manuscript . All the parameters described below remained constant for all oocytes observed in this study . Assessment of oocyte integrity was evaluated by the conﬁguration of the spindle , alignment of the chro - mosomes in the equatorial plane , and the amount and location of ﬂuorescent microtubules and microﬁlaments in the oocyte . Oocytes in germinal vesicle ( GV ) stage were classiﬁed by having a diffuse appearance of their chromatin and weakly labeled microtubules and microﬁlaments dis - tributed uniformly throughout the ooplasm . Metaphase - I ( M - I ) oocytes were characterized by the presence of highly condensed chromosomes , microtubules were radially elongated around the chromosomes and microﬁlaments were distributed throughout the oocyte . Metaphase - II ( M - II ) oocytes were char - acterized by the presence of well - organized chromosomes aligned along a second meiotic spindle , microtubules observed at the spindle and microﬁlament distribution concentrated in the cortex of the oocyte were classiﬁed as oocyte reaching M - II stage of development . Abnormal oocytes were characterized by the presence of a disorganized or disperse spindle elements or accumulation of microtubules mass near the condensed chromatin arrangements . StatisticalanalysesThedifferencesinoocyte maturation were carried out by the x 2 and Fisher’s exact tests . Cytoskeleton distribution was merely descriptive and used to evaluate maturation status of equine oocytes after IVM . Statistical analysis was realized using Minitab 14 software ( Minitab Inc . , State College , PA , USA ) and differences were considered signiﬁcant when P < 0 . 05 . Results From recovered oocytes , 360 ( 80 . 5 % ) were classiﬁed as compact , 52 ( 11 . 6 % ) were classiﬁed as degenerated and 35 ( 7 . 9 % ) were classiﬁed as expanded . After selection , 301 oocytes with compact cumulus cells were used in the experiment . We observed a lower number of evaluated oocytes ( 55 % ) used for ﬁnal interpretation of the results owing to the fact that equine oocytes were preserved in block solution , transported to University of California , Davis , USA , and recovered from the eppendorf microtubes for staining and further confocal evaluation . Chromatin conﬁguration at the GV stage showed a diffused appearance without any visible organization into distinct chromosomes . Oocytes in the GV stage displayed a complex network of microtubules distributed uniformly throughout the ooplasm . Oocytes that had progressed to metaphase of the ﬁrst meiotic division showed individual chromosomes as aggregated dots of condensed chromatin . A complete Effect of eGH on IVM of equine oocytes 1495 rearrangement of the microtubules was observed after GV breakdown ( GVBD ) that displayed radial - like microtubules in close association with the recent condensed chromosomes ( Supplementary Figure S1a , b ) . Oocytes that reached meta - phase of the second meiotic division showed compact chro - mosomes aligned along the equatorial plane of the spindle structure . Metaphase - II oocytes had a classic symmetrical barrel - shaped structure , with chromosomes aligned along the equatorial plane and microtubules forming a clear spin - dle ( Supplementary Figure S1c , d ) . Abnormal spindle struc - tures were associated with lack of chromosomes and an accumulation of a microtubular mass near the condensed chromatin . Microtubules appeared to be detached from the spindle poles and spread into the ooplasm ( Supplementary Figure S1e , f ) . When microﬁlaments were analyzed , oocytes at GV stage showed a distribution throughout the subcortical region of the ooplasm ( Supplementary Figure S2a ) . Microﬁlaments appeared as a layer immediately beneath the plasma membrane and as discrete foci on the cortical region as oocytes progress to maturity ( Supplementary Figure S2b , c ) . Abnormal actin ﬁlaments distribution was observed as an irregular mass close to the con - densed chromatin ( Supplementary Figure S2d ) . Cytoskeleton conﬁguration was used to provide the basic description of cytoskeleton modiﬁcation during IVM , and to determine the maturation status of each oocyte for its ﬁnal interpretation . Experiment1 : EffectsofeGHandIGF - IonequineCOCs A total of 169 COCs were cultured in vitro , but only 85 oocytes were stained . Overall , the percentage of 10 . 6 % , 40 . 0 % , 17 . 6 % and 31 . 8 % oocytes were classiﬁed as abnormal , GV , M - I and M - II stages of development , respec - tively . The addition of eGH , IGF - I and eGH 1 IGF - I in the base medium had no signiﬁcant effect on the percentage of equine oocytes reaching M - II compared with the control group , whereas the highest maturation rates ( 36 . 3 % ) were observed when eGH alone was added into maturation medium . The highest percentage of GV oocytes was observed when the eGH and IGF - I ( 9 / 17 ; 52 . 9 % ) were added in maturation medium . In this experiment , only 10 . 6 % ( 9 / 85 ) COCs evaluated showed the presence of abnormal chroma - tin conﬁguration with dispersed chromosomes . Data are presented in Table 1 . Experiment2 : EffectofeGH , E 2 , FSH , LHandFCS onequineCOCsAtotalof132COCs were matured in vitro , but only 82 oocytes were stained . Overall , the percentage of 11 . 0 % , 31 . 7 % , 26 . 8 % and 30 . 5 % oocytes were classiﬁed as abnormal , GV , M - I and M - II stages of development , respec - tively . More ( P , 0 . 05 ) oocytes reached M - II stage after maturation in the presence of eGH , E 2 , FSH , LH and FCS than the control group ( 11 / 30 ; 36 . 7 % v . 3 / 17 ; 17 . 6 % , respec - tively ) . However , no difference ( P . 0 . 05 ) was observed when COCs were treated with eGH , E2 , FSH , LH and FCS compared with eGH alone . Incubation with eGH alone had the highest maturation rate ( 40 . 0 % , 8 / 20 ) when compared with control ( 3 / 17 ; 17 . 6 % ) ( P , 0 . 05 ; Table 2 ) .

Data from ﬁve replicates were pooled . Pereira , Lorenzo , Carneiro , Ball , Pegoraro , Pimentel and Liu 1496 investigated in this study . The results showed that eGH added in the presence of E 2 , gonadotropins and FCS had a positive effect on nuclear maturation compared with equine oocytes cultured invitro without additional growth factors . The addition of eGH to an IVM media containing hormones promotes nuclear maturation and cytoplasmic segregation during the maturation of equine oocytes invitro . In the current study , we found that eGH in the presence of IGF - I added to IVM media caused no change in the percen - tage of equine oocytes reaching M - II ( 35 . 29 % ) compared with the control group ( 21 . 43 % ) ; however , the highest maturation rates ( 36 . 36 % ) were observed when eGH alone was added into culture . Hinrichs and Williams ( 1997 ) repor - ted that equine oocytes with compact cumulus cells are not competent to mature in vitro ; however , expanded oocytes have a high meiotic competence . In contrast , Carneiro etal . ( 2002 ) observed that compact equine oocytes were able to mature in the presence of IGF - I and gonadotropins invitro . In previous studies , we have demonstrated that the addition of eGH to media containing IGF - I signiﬁcantly increased the maturation of equine oocytes to M - I and M - II stages of development when compared with control ( Pereira et al . , 2006 , 2012 ) . Carneiro et al . ( 2001 , 2002 ) used an IVM system in the presence of IGF - I and observed an improved cytoplasmic maturation on the basis of the migration of cortical granules to the periphery of horse oocytes and an increased cleavage rate after parthenogenetic activation . IGF - I has been reported to stimulate bovine oocyte matura - tion and fertilization invitro ( Lorenzo etal . , 1994 ) , and to promote rabbit blastocyst development ( Herrler etal . , 1998 ) . Moreover , the effects of eGH could be possibly mediated by IGF - I in equine oocytes matured invitro . We also observed in our study that compact COCs were effective for maturation under culture with eGH associated with E 2 , FSH , LH and FCS . The percentage of oocytes cultured with eGH in the presence of E 2 , FSH , LH and FCS signiﬁcantly increased the number of oocytes reaching M - II stage ( 36 . 67 % ) compared with oocytes in the control group ( 17 . 65 % ) . The low maturation rate observed in the control group may be partly explained by the absence of serum in the media containing COCs . Thus , the addition of hormones and factors into IVM might suggest an important role to trigger oocyte maturation invitro . However , when eGH was added alone into IVM , maturation rates were similar com - pared with the addition of eGH to an IVM media containing hormones ( 40 . 0 % v . 36 . 7 % , respectively ) . Marchal et al . ( 2003 ) reported a signiﬁcant increase in the percentage of oocytes reaching M - II ( 43 % ) when eGH and equine - luteinizing hormone ( eLH ) were used in vitro to promote equine oocyte development . Gonadotropins are the main regulators of nuclear maturation of oocytes invivo ; however , recent observations suggest that gonadotropins are only part of a complex system of autocrine and paracrine factors that may inﬂuence oocyte competence . In agreement with Marchal etal . ( 2003 ) , we also observed a maturation rate of 40 . 0 % in oocytes reaching M - II stage when eGH was added into culture . The present study showed that microtubules and micro - ﬁlaments play an important role on the distribution of com - ponents of the cytoskeleton that can facilitate nuclear maturation and cytoplasmatic segregation of horse oocytes cultured in vitro . We observed that cytoskeleton changes were more evident in the majority of oocytes matured in the presence of eGH , E 2 , gonadotropins and FCS group . Siddiqui et al . ( 2009 ) reported rates of 89 % of oocytes reaching M - I and M - II stages of development on the basis of nuclear conﬁguration , spindle morphology and cytoskeleton organi - zation using ﬂuorescent probes to evaluate horse oocytes collected in vivo from human chorionic gonadotropin - stimulated mares . The results from the present study are in agreement with a report ( Tremoleda et al . , 2003 ) that described cytoskeletal changes of equine oocytes before fertilization by intracytoplasmic sperm injection and also in equine embryos . In our study , oocytes in GV stage displayed a complex of microtubule networks distributed uniformly throughout the ooplasm , and the chromatin conﬁguration had a diffused appearance without any visible organization into distinct chromosomes . Similar observations have also been descri - bed in GV mouse oocytes where cytoplasmic microtubules began to extend into the subcortical regions of the ooplasm when meiotic progression toward GVBD occurred ( Messinger and Albertini , 1991 ) . In contrast , goat and pig oocytes showed no microtubule distribution in early GV stage , although they become apparent in the meiotic spindle during the later meiotic stages ( Kim etal . , 1997 ; Sui etal . , 2005 ) . A complete rearrangement of the cytoplasmic micro - tubules was observed after GVBD that displayed radial - like microtubules in close association with condensed chromo - somes . Oocytes that had progressed to the metaphase of the ﬁrst meiotic division showed individual chromosomes visible as aggregated dots of condensed chromatin . This ﬁnding is associated with the development of meiotically competent oocytes and the phosphorylation of centrosomes in other mammalian species ( Sui etal . , 2005 ) . Viable oocytes in the current study showed microtubules at the meiotic spindle as a symmetrical barrel - shaped structure with chromosomes aligned along its center . Our description of the meiotic spindle of horse oocytes at M - II stage was very similar to that reported for other species such as cows ( Kim et al . , 2000 ) and pigs ( Ma et al . , 2003 ) . In horses , Goudet et al . ( 1997 ) and Tremoleda et al . ( 2001 ) also reported similar microtubule organization that was also concentrated in the meiotic spindle surrounding the aligned chromosomes . The presence of disorganized microtubules at the meiotic spindle seen in the present study has also been described in women oocytes ( Li etal . , 2006 ) . Damage to microtubule organization results in depolymerization of the meiotic spindles in mammalian oocytes , leading to an irreversible process that results in chromosomal abnormalities after fertilization , such as aneuploidy and polyploidy ( Wang and Sun , 2006 ) . Mammalian oocytes that are atypical in the progression of meiotic maturation displayed aberrant con - ﬁgurations of microtubules and abnormal chromosome Effect of eGH on IVM of equine oocytes 1497 morphology ( De La Fuente , 2006 ) . Recently , Siddiqui et al . ( 2009 ) reported a rate of 11 % of atypical equine oocytes recovered in vivo showing apparent abnormalities of the microtubules organization . In agreement with reports on mouse oocytes , we also observed that a few oocytes ( around 10 % ) had a scattered and disorganized aggregation of chromatin and microtubules . Oocytes reaching M - II stage showed the distribution of microﬁlaments with a stained layer of actins observed immediately beneath the plasma membrane . In the present study , we observed the presence of strands of microﬁla - ments within the zona pellucida ; a similar pattern has been described as part of transzonal processes extending from the cumulus cells , which is thought to be essential to the pro - duction of a developmentally competent female gamete ( Allworth and Albertini , 1993 ) . Conclusions In summary , the present study provides a description of microtubules , microﬁlaments and chromatin conﬁguration on compact horse oocytes after culture with additional growth factors invitro . On the basis of the results described in this study , we conclude that the use of eGH in the pre - sence of E 2 , gonadotropins and FCS has a positive effect on the proportion of oocytes reaching M - II stage of compact equine oocytes during 30 h of culture invitro . These obser - vations suggest a synergistic interaction between eGH , gonadotropins , E 2 and FCS in nuclear maturation and cytoskeleton segregation of equine oocytes . These ﬁndings emphasize that further studies at the molecular level are needed to understand different oocyte handling procedures invitroin horses .
