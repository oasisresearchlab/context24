Received : 24 July 2018 ; Accepted : 16 August 2018 ; Published : 20 August 2018 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:1) (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7) Abstract : Colon cancer is one of the most common cancer types . Its positive correlation with general obesity has led to increasing amounts of research focusing on the role of adipokines in colon cancer development . Apelin is a peptide released by adipose tissue that could affect many cellular processes connected with carcinogenesis . In this study , we examined the role of apelin in the motility regulation of colon cancer cells . We showed that the effect of four different apelin peptides increased the ability of cancer cells to migrate and invade examined cells trough inﬂuencing migratory protrusions formation and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement . Additionally , using confocal microscopy , we noticed that apelin stimulated the proteolytic activity of cancer cells , especially increasing the level of membrane - type 1 matrix metalloprotease . Taken together , apelin increased the movement of colon cancer cells through several possible mechanisms . Moreover , better understanding the process through which apelin regulates cancer development is still necessary to the creation of novel anti - cancer therapy .

Introduction Colon cancer is an aggressive disease that continues to have a considerable impact on global health . According to predictions , the number of colon cancer cases will continue to grow in the next years , especially in the young adult group [ 1 , 2 ] . Moreover , strong evidence shows that colorectal cancer is positively correlated with obesity . There are few plausible mechanisms that explain this correlation , including insulin resistance , chronic inﬂammation and altered levels of growth factors or adipokines [ 3 ] . For this reason , studies examining colon cancer biology and its correlation with obesity , which could help ﬁnd new and more effective diagnostic and therapeutic targets , are still necessary . Apelin is a secreted peptide , synthetized as a 77 - amino acid precursor called preproapelin , which belongs to the adipokine family . Preproapelin may generate several active fragments : a 36 - amino acid peptide corresponding to the sequence 42 – 77 ( apelin - 36 ) , a 17 - amino acid peptide consistent with the sequence 61 – 77 ( apelin - 17 ) and a 13 - amino acid peptide equivalent to the sequence 65 – 77 ( apelin - 13 ) , which are the most common forms of apelin [ 4 ] . This latter fragment may also undergo pyroglutamylation at the level of its N - terminal glutamine residue , which results in its protection from exopeptidase degradation . This form of apelin— [ Pyr1 ] apelin - 13 , was identiﬁed as the major apelin variant in human plasma [ 5 ] . Both apelin ( APLN ) and its receptor ( APLNR , APJ ) have been implicated as key regulators of central and peripheral responses to multiple homeostatic perturbations . For a long time , apelin was thought to only a role in the regulation of cardiovascular function , angiogenesis , ﬂuid homeostasis and energy metabolism [ 6 , 7 ] . However , recent ﬁndings showed that Cells 2018 , 7 , 113 ; doi : 10 . 3390 / cells7080113 www . mdpi . com / journal / cells Cells 2018 , 7 , 113 2 of 17 apelin may be a possibly important proangiogenic factor in cancer [ 8 ] . Increasing number amount of data also suggest , that that apelin might be a potential anti - cancer therapeutic target [ 9 ] . APLN levels increased in non - small cell lung cancer samples in comparison to normal lung tissue and high apelin levels were related to poor overall patient survival [ 10 ] . Higher expression levels of APLN and APJ were also detected in hepatocellular carcinoma tumours [ 11 ] and in human colon adenomas and adenocarcinomas in comparison to healthy tissue [ 12 ] . Exogenous apelin had anti - apoptotic effects on colon cancer cells [ 12 ] , whereas in human colon cancer cell lines , this peptide stimulated proliferation through the JAG - 1 / Notch3 signalling pathway [ 13 ] . Cell migration plays a significant role in many physiological and pathological processes , such as embryogenesis , wound healing , angiogenesis and metastasis . One of the main factors involved in the regulation of cell movement is actin cytoskeleton [ 14 ] . Actin is a conservative protein , implicated in many different processes , such as muscle contraction , cell motility , adhesion and maintenance of shape [ 15 , 16 ] . The organisation of the actin cytoskeleton is regulated by multiple actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) , which regulate the dynamic balance between monomeric and polymerized ( filamentous ) form of actin . This proportion may be disturbed in cancer cells [ 17 ] . One of the ABPs is cofilin , which interacts with both monomeric and filamentous actin . This protein affects the dynamic remodelling of actin cytoskeleton and can act in two ways : severing actin filaments and increasing depolymerization speed by augmenting the dissociation of monomers from actin filaments [ 18 ] . Some data also indicated that cofilin influenced by apelin could stimulate the migration of lung cancer cells [ 19 ] . To allow cancer cell growth and metastasis , it is necessary to reorganize and degrade the barrier constituted by the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) via appropriate proteases , such as matrix metalloproteases ( MMPs ) [ 20 ] . Some data indicated that apelin stimulated the migration of several types of cancer cells , like human lung adenocarcinoma [ 19 ] , gastric cancer [ 21 ] and oral squamous cell carcinoma [ 22 ] . Moreover , apelin can affect the invasion of breast cancer cells by inducing the expression of MMP - 1 [ 23 ] , and in the case of gastric cancer cells , MMP - 1 and MMP - 9 levels were elevated [ 21 ] . However , no data focus on the effect of apelin on MMPs - dependent colon cancer cell migration . Therefore , the aim of our studies was to analyse if apelin is able to regulate the migration and invasion abilities of parental LS180 colon cancer cell line and the EB3 , 3LNLN and 5W sublines , which have different migration abilities [ 24 ] . Moreover , several possible mechanisms of action were analysed . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Chemicals and Reagents Antibodies to ezrin and coﬁlin were from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) . Antibodies to GAPDH were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc . , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) . Antibody to MT1 - MMP was from Merck Millipore ( Darmstadt , Germany ) . Horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated secondary antibodies were from Cell Signalling Technology ( Danvers , MA , USA ) . The secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor ® 488 goat anti - rabbit immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) , Phalloidin Alexa Fluor ® 568 and Hoechst 33342 were from Invitrogen ( Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . [ Pyr1 ] apelin - 13 ( pQRPRLSHKGPMPF ) , apelin - 13 ( QRPRLSHKGPMPF ) , - 17 ( KFRRQRPRLSHKGPMPF ) and - 36 ( LVQPRGSRNGPGPWQGGRRKFRRQRPRLSHKGPMPF ) were from Bachem ( Bubendorf , Switzerland ) , and ML221 was from Sigma . Matrigel™ was from Corning ® ( New York , NY , USA ) . 2 . 2 . Cell Culture The human colorectal carcinoma cell line LS180 was obtained from Deutsche Krebsforschungzentrum , Heidelberg , Germany . The selected cell lines EB3 , 3LNLN and 5W were obtained from the Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy , Polish Academy of Sciences in Wroclaw , Poland . As previously described , the EB3 cell line was received through in vitro selection of LS180 cells . Cell lines 3LNLN and 5W were obtained by in vivo selection of EB3 cells in mice that metastasized to the lymph nodes and Cells 2018 , 7 , 113 3 of 17 liver , respectively [ 25 ] . All cell lines were confirmed by LGC Cell Line Authentication Service . Cells were cultivated in MEM - α medium ( Corning ® ) containing 10 % FBS ( Sigma ) , 2 mM glutamine ( Sigma ) and antibiotics ( 100 U / mL penicillin , 100 µ g / mL streptomycin ) ( Sigma ) in tissue culture flasks at 37 ◦ C under humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 and passaged twice a week using 0 . 25 % trypsin / 0 . 05 % EDTA solution ( IITD PAN , Wroclaw , Poland ) . 2 . 3 . Proliferation Analysis Twenty - four hours after cell seeding onto 96 - well plates ( 3 × 10 3 cells ) , apelin peptides ( 100 nM ) in MEM - α medium were added into the cells and incubated in IncuCyte ZOOM Kinetic Live Cell Imaging System ( Essen Biosciences Inc . , Ann Arbor , MI , USA ) for 72 h . The images were taken every 24 h . The results are presented as a proliferation rate ( percent of conﬂuence in given time to percent of conﬂuence in time zero ) . The experiments were performed three times and each independent experiment consisted of three measurements . 2 . 4 . Migration and Invasion Assay Cell migration and invasion assays were performed using Transwell™ ﬁlters ( PET membrane with 8 µ m pore size ) ( BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) in 24 - well plates . Twenty - four hours after seeding on 6 - well plates cells were starved in serum - free MEM - α medium for 6 h . Next , cells were seeded ( 5 × 10 4 cells ) in serum - free MEM - α supplemented with apelin peptides ( 100 nM ) or ML221 ( 100 nM ) directly onto rehydrated Transwell™ insert for migration assay or coated with Matrigel™ ( 0 . 5 mg / mL in serum - free MEM - α medium ) for invasion assay . The lower part of the well was ﬁlled with MEM - α medium containing 20 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 5 nM EGF or 50 % FBS and 5 nM epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , used as a chemoattractant for migration and invasion assays , respectively . After 24 h , non - migrating cells were removed , the cells migrated through the ﬁlter were ﬁxed with 4 % formaldehyde , stained with Hoechst 33342 ( Invitrogen ) and counted using a ﬂuorescent microscope Olympus IX70 ( Olympus , Tokio , Japan ) . The score of migrated or invaded cells was obtained by counting cells that migrated or invaded through the Transwell™ ﬁlters from whole insert area . The results are provided as a relative migration or invasion factor ( % of control ) , where control cells are presented as a 100 % . The experiments were performed three times and each independent experiment consisted of three replicates . 2 . 5 . Cytosolic Fraction Isolation The cytosolic fraction of the cells was prepared as described by Malicka - Błaszkiewicz and Roth [ 26 ] . Brieﬂy , the cells were grown in tissue culture dishes with apelin peptides ( 100 nM ) or ML221 ( 100 nM ) for 24 h , then were gently washed three times with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , scraped with a tissue culture cell scraper and suspended in freshly made monomeric actin stabilizing buffer A ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 and 0 . 25 M sucrose ) . Then , the cells were centrifuged in 1000 × g , 5 min at 4 ◦ C and homogenized in 3 volumes of ice - cold monomeric actin stabilizing buffer A with a Dounce homogenizer on ice . After ultracentrifugation of homogenates in 105 , 000 × g , 1 h and 4 ◦ C , supernatants used as a cytosolic fraction were collected and frozen in − 80 ◦ C . All experiments were performed in triplicates . 2 . 6 . Actin Polymerization State Determination The actin polymerization state was evaluated by measurement of the inhibition of DNase I bovine pancreas [ 26 ] . The concentration of monomeric ( G ) actin was analysed directly in the cytosolic fraction of the cells . The concentration of total ( T ) actin was determined in diluted cytosolic fraction with monomeric actin stabilizing buffer A without sucrose . This step was critical for completely depolymerizing ﬁlamentous ( F ) actin . The amount of F - actin was calculated by subtracting the amount of G actin from the total actin ( F = T − G ) . The actin polymerization state was determined as the ratio of F - actin to G - actin ( F : G actin ) . One unit of DNase I inhibitor ( actin ) was the concentration of actin that Cells 2018 , 7 , 113 4 of 17 decreases the activity of 20 mg of DNase I by 10 % under standard assay conditions [ 26 ] . The results are presented as units of DNase I inhibitor per mg of a sample protein . The experiments were performed three times . 2 . 7 . Cell Extracts Isolation Twenty - four hours after cell seeding onto 6 - well plates apelin peptides ( 100 nM ) or ML221 ( 100 nM ) were added into the cells and incubated in MEM - α medium for the next 24 h . After cells were lysed on ice with RIPA lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS and 1 mM EDTA ) , supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors cocktails ( Sigma ) and collected with a cell scraper . After three frozen - thawed cycles and centrifugation in 12 , 000 × g , 10 min , at 4 ◦ C , supernatants were collected and used for further analysis . 2 . 8 . Western Blotting Assay The protein concentration in cell extracts was determined using the Bradford procedure [ 27 ] . Samples with identical protein quantity ( 30 µ g ) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate – polyacrylamide gel ( 10 % acrylamide / bis ) electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes ( GE Healthcare , Chicago , IL , USA ) . After transfer , total protein analysis was performed using Ponceau S staining . Target proteins were probed with specific antibodies and detected using Western blotting Luminol Reagent ( Bio - Rad ) under ChemiDoc ( Bio - Rad ) and analysed with Image Lab software ( ver . 6 . 0 , Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) . The experiments were performed three times . Image Lab software was used for densitometry analysis of protein bands . 2 . 9 . Fluorescent Staining Twenty - four hours after cell seeding onto sterile coverslips in 24 - well plates , apelin peptides ( 100 nM ) or ML221 ( 100 nM ) were added into the cells for next 24 h . Then , cells were ﬁxed with 4 % formaldehyde and permeabilized using 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . After blocking with 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , cells were incubated with speciﬁc primary antibodies overnight at 4 ◦ C . Next , the cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with Phalloidin Alexa Fluor ® 568 , Hoechst 33342 and secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor ® 488 for 1 h in room temperature . After washing with PBS , coverslips were mounted in Dako ® cytomatic ﬂuorescent mounting medium ( Dako ) . The localization of proteins was analysed using a confocal laser scanning microscope , Leica SP8 , with LasX 3 . 3 . 0 software ( Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) . Images were processed using ImageJ 1 . 52d software ( ImageJ , Bethesda , MD , USA ) [ 28 ] . Blebs quantiﬁcation was calculated as a percent of cells forming blebs for 100 cells per condition and presented as a percent of control . The experiments were performed three times . The number of MT1 - MMPs positive signals was calculated for 30 cells per condition using ImageJ software and quantitative analysis of focal adhesion protocol [ 28 , 29 ] and presented as a percent of control . 2 . 10 . Fluorescent - Substrate Degradation Assay The experiment was performed using a previously described protocol [ 30 ] . Sterile coverslips coated with poly - L - lysine ( BD Biosciences ) were washed with PBS and incubated with 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde for 15 min in room temperature . Coverslips were washed with PBS and coated with FITC - conjugated gelatine ( Invitrogen ) for 10 min . After washing with PBS , coverslips were incubated with sodium borohydride for 1 min and washed again with PBS . To determine the proteolytic activity , cells were seeded onto prepared coverslips ( 5 × 10 4 cells ) and grown with apelin peptides ( 100 nM ) or ML221 ( 100 nM ) for 24 h . Cells were ﬁxed with 4 % formaldehyde and stained with Phalloidin Alexa Fluor ® 568 for ﬁlamentous actin detection . Images were collected using an Olympus IX70 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) with FLUOVIEW FV1000 software ( Olympus , Tokio , Japan ) . Images were analysed through quantiﬁcation of darker areas lacking ﬂuorescence , which reﬂected increased activity of ECM degrading proteases using ImageJ software [ 28 ] . The results Cells 2018 , 7 , 113 5 of 17 were calculated as a percent of cells digesting gelatine and then presented as a percent of control . The experiments were performed three times . 2 . 11 . Statistical Analysis All data are shown as a mean ± standard deviations ( SD ) and their signiﬁcance was determined using Student’s t test . The signiﬁcance test was set at p < 0 . 05 ( * ) , p < 0 . 01 ( * * ) or p < 0 . 001 ( * * * ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Apelin Increases Proliferation , Migration and Invasion of Colon Cancer Cells Some studies indicated that apelin could stimulate cell proliferation [ 23 , 31 ] . Thus , we examined the proliferation rate of colon cancer cell lines : parental LS180 and sublines : EB3 , 3LNLN and 5W , which were shown to present different migratory potential [ 24 ] . Four apelin peptides were tested : [ Pyr1 ] apelin - 13 ( pA13 ) , apelin - 13 ( A13 ) , apelin - 17 ( A17 ) and apelin - 36 ( A36 ) . Based on bibliographical data [ 12 ] and our studies ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) , we selected 100 nM concentration for all apelin peptides , displaying no cytotoxic effect on examined cells , that was able to influence cellular processes . There was no effect of apelin on cell proliferation after 24 h . Therefore , all experiments were performed for that time . Moreover , apelin peptides increased the proliferation rate of tested cells measured for 48 h or 72 h ( Figure 1A ) . Apelin could be also involved in cancer cell migration [ 19 , 21 , 22 ] . Therefore , we examined migration abilities of colon cancer cell lines . We tested four apelin peptides , as well as the APJ receptor antagonist ML221 . In Transwell™ migration assay apelin peptides stimulated cell motility in all cell lines , whereas ML221 decreased it ( Figure 1B ) . The total number of migrating cells in all cell lines is presented in Supplementary Figure 2A . Apelin was also shown to modulate the invasiveness of melanoma cells and to induce its metastasis to lymph nodes [ 32 ] . Therefore , the effect of apelin on invasion abilities of colon cancer cells was analysed using Transwell™ invasion assay ( Figure 1C ) . Apelin peptides stimulated the invasion of all tested cells trough Matrigel™ , imitating the invasion through ECM , whereas ML221 showed a decrease ability to invade . The total number of invading cells of all cell lines was shown in Supplementary Figure 2B . Cells 2018 , 7 , 113 6 of 17 Figure 1 .

Cells 2018 , 7 , 113 7 of 17 3 . 2 . Apelin Stimulates Blebs Formation in Colon Cancer Cells All examined cells were characterized by rounded morphology and speciﬁc spherical migratory protrusions formation . There are several publications presenting the connection between blebbing and the migration potential of cells [ 33 , 34 ] . These protrusions—called blebs—are typical of cells using ameboid type movement [ 35 ] . Moreover , to evaluate if apelin peptides could inﬂuence blebs formation , ezrin , a marker of blebs protrusions and ﬁlamentous actin were stained using immunocytochemistry ( Figure 2A ) . Fluorescent staining showed increased number of cells forming blebs after apelin peptides stimulation . To conﬁrm this result , cells forming blebs were counted ( Figure 2B ) . Apelin peptides treatment increased the number of cells creating protrusions in LS180 , EB3 and 3LNLN cell lines . In LS180 and EB3 cells , ML221 acted in the opposite way by decreasing the number of cells . Additionally , we visualized the effect of apelin on blebs formation in viable cells . For this reason , parental LS180 cells were transfected with LiveAct ® plasmid enabling the visualization of ﬁlamentous actin as red ﬂuorescence , therefore highlighting the cytoskeleton structure of the cells , including migratory protrusions . The incubation of tested cells with apelin ( representative for apelin - 36 ) resulted in increased blebs formation ( Supplementary Movie 1B ) , whereas stimulation with ML221 was characterized by the complete blockage of protrusions creation ( Supplementary Movie 1C ) in comparison with non - treated cells ( Supplementary Movie 1A ) . Moreover , to verify the differences in ezrin levels observed during ﬂuorescent staining , the level of this protein was analysed using Western blotting ( Figure 2C ) . It came across as apelin elevated the level of ezrin , and APJ antagonist ML221 decreased it , in all cell lines tested , excluding 3LNLN cell line . These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed by densitometric analysis ( Figure 2D ) . Blebs formation is often connected with apoptosis [ 36 ] . According to many studies apelin may prevent apoptosis [ 37 , 38 ] ; therefore , we examined if apelin could prevent staurosporin ( STS ) - induced apoptosis of colon cancer cells using Annexin V - FITC and propidium iodide assay ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . Our results showed no ability of apelin to prevent STS - induced apoptosis , as well as no pro - apoptotic effect due to the fact that the apoptotic process has not been enhanced by apelin .

Apelin Inﬂuences Actin Polymerisation State and the Level of Coﬁlin One of the major steps in cell movement is migratory protrusions formation . This process is based on actin rearrangement involving actin polymerisation [ 34 ] . Therefore , the polymerisation Cells 2018 , 7 , 113 9 of 17 state of cytoplasmic actin was examined in LS180 and sublines . Apelin peptides treatment increased the ratio of ﬁlamentous ( F - actin ) to monomeric ( G - actin ) actin in all cytoplasmic fractions of colon cancer cells used ( Figure 3A ) . This result suggests that increased levels of ﬁlamentous actin after apelin stimulation could be connected with increased migration abilities . However , an increased F : G actin ratio after ML221 treatment was also noticed . Elevated levels of ﬁlamentous actin could be associated with altered level of some actin - binding proteins involved in cytoskeleton reorganisation . Coﬁlin is a multifunctional protein regulating actin dynamics [ 39 ] . Decreased levels of coﬁlin after ML221 treatment were observed in all tested cells ( Figure 3B ) . These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed by densitometric analysis ( Figure 3C ) . Figure 3 . Effect of apelin on actin polymerisation and level of coﬁlin .

Apelin Effects the Proteolytic Abilities of Colon Cancer Cells Invasiveness of cancer cells is usually connected with their ability to degrade the extracellular matrix by proteolytic enzymes [ 20 ] . Therefore , the inﬂuence of apelin peptides and ML221 on the proteolytic activity of colon cancer cells was examined using gelatine - FITC degradation assay ( Figure 4A ) . FITC - conjugated gelatine presented as a green background . Black dots reﬂect areas digested by colon cancer cells’ proteases . Stimulation with apelin peptides resulted in an increased number of black areas in all cell lines . Next , digested areas reﬂecting proteolytic activity of cells were counted ( Figure 4B ) . Our data indicated that apelin peptides elevated proteolytic activity in all cell lines shown as a percent of cells digesting gelatine . Figure 4 .

Metalloproteases are one of the main groups of enzymes involved in degradation and remodelling of ECM , promoting invasion and metastasis [ 40 ] . Previous studies showed that apelin could induce Cells 2018 , 7 , 113 11 of 17 the expression of matrix metalloproteases in gastric cancer cells [ 21 ] . Therefore , the inﬂuence of apelin peptides on the level of MT1 - MMP , which belongs to the family of membrane - anchored MMPs , was determined using immunocytochemistry [ 41 ] . Apelin stimulation resulted in slightly increased levels of MT1 - MMP ( Figure 5A ) , which was conﬁrmed by quantiﬁcation of the number of MT1 - MMP positive signals ( Figure 5B ) . Figure 5 .

Discussion Many studies have indicated that adipose tissue could be involved in the development of obesity - related disorders . Fat storage is not the only function of adipose tissue ; it also secrets biologically Cells 2018 , 7 , 113 12 of 17 active compounds regulating metabolic homeostasis , such as adipokines [ 42 ] . These adipose tissue - derived peptides regulate several physiological processes , including energy balance , appetite regulation , insulin sensitization , inflammatory response and vascular homeostasis [ 43 ] . Thus , under obesity , the increased secretion of adipokines leads to metabolic disturbances that could play role in further disorder development , including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases [ 42 ] . The correlation between carcinogenesis and increased body mass index suggests that obesity plays an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis [ 3 ] . Apelin , which belongs to the adipokines family , also plays a role in obesity . In a group of obese female children , apelin - 12 plasma levels were signiﬁcantly increased in comparison with non - obese patients [ 44 ] . Moreover , in obese men with colon cancer , the level of plasma apelin - 12 was also increased [ 45 ] . Nevertheless , tumour - associated apelin , instead of serum apelin levels , is closely connected with more advanced clinical features , including tumour differentiation and distant metastases in the case of gastric cancer [ 21 ] . Moreover , apelin peptides increased migration and invasion abilities of several types of cancer , including lung adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer [ 19 , 21 , 22 ] . However , the mechanism of apelin’s action in colon cancer is still unknown . In our study , we examined the inﬂuence of apelin peptides on colon cancer cell motility . To achieve this goal , we used four cell lines with different migratory potential : parental LS180 colon cancer cell line , selected in vitro from parental cell line EB3 and selected in vivo from EB3 , 3LNLN and 5W cell lines , that metastasized to the lymph nodes and to the liver , respectively [ 25 ] . Various apelin peptides have been used in many studies ; however , controversies have emerged concerning the activity or type of these peptides . Due to this fact , we examined and compared four apelin peptides : [ Pyr1 ] apelin - 13 , apelin - 13 , - 17 and - 36 . All these peptides are present in human serum and are able to activate the apelin receptor APJ [ 46 ] . As an additional control , we used APJ functional antagonist ML221 , which binds to the receptor and blocks the possibility of linking apelin and activating APJ [ 47 ] . Based on bibliographical data [ 12 ] and our results , we selected 100 nM concentrations of all apelin peptides and as well as ML221 , which has no cytotoxic effect on in vitro cell cultures , and are able to inﬂuence cellular processes . First , we examined the effect of apelin peptides on migration and invasion abilities . Migration assay revealed , that all apelin peptides stimulate migration in all cell lines . Similar results were obtained when examining apelin - 13 inﬂuence on lung adenocarcinoma A549 migration abilities . Apelin also contributed to lung adenocarcinoma resistance to chemotherapy - induced inhibition of cell metastasis [ 19 ] . Therefore , we checked the invasion facilities of tested cells after apelin treatment . In this case cells were seeded into Matrigel™ - coated Transwell™ inserts , to imitate the invasion of cancer cells through ECM . These results resembled those obtained with the migration test . The same ﬁndings were obtained by Feng et al . , who observed that apelin increased the invasion rate of gastric cancer cells by upregulation of several cytokines known to facilitate tumour progression , such as BMP - 2 , IL1 and IL6 . Nevertheless the type of apelin was not speciﬁed [ 21 ] . Migration of cells is connected to the creation of migratory protrusions . Typical structures in cells characterized with a rounded morphology are blebs . These actin - rich structures can occur anywhere on the plasma membrane [ 48 ] . Several publications have presented the connection between blebbing and the migration potential of cells [ 33 , 34 ] . The experimental induction of blebs formation in non - invasive cells resulted in increased ability of these cells to invade into 3D matrices . Moreover , bleb - associated cell motility is connected with multiple molecular mechanisms including actin - mediated bleb retraction [ 49 ] . Since the examined colon cancer cells are able to form blebs protrusions [ 35 ] , we investigated whether apelin stimulation inﬂuenced their formation . We used immunocytochemistry to visualise ezrin and ﬁlamentous actin . Ezrin belongs to the ABPs and is an actin - membrane linker , essential for several cellular processes , including cell shape determination , adhesion and motility [ 50 ] . It localizes in migratory protrusions [ 34 ] . Therefore , we used ezrin as a marker of blebs . Our observations suggest , that apelin peptides increased the number of cells forming blebs . These implications were conﬁrmed ( except in the 5W cell line ) by quantifying the number of blebbing cells . We also visualized ﬁlamentous actin in viable parental colon cancer cells . The movie Cells 2018 , 7 , 113 13 of 17 shows the dynamic process of protrusions creation after apelin treatment . Moreover , the differential number of cells forming blebs caused by apelin stimulation resulted in altered ezrin levels . All these ﬁndings indicate that apelin peptides may increase migration abilities by affecting protrusion activity . Migratory protrusion formation is usually connected with actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and recruitment of actin - binding proteins [ 34 ] . Moreover , increased migration abilities of colon cancer cells are connected with a larger F - to G - actin ratio [ 24 ] . For this reason , we examined the actin polymerisation state in the cytoplasmic fraction of colon cancer cells incubated with apelin . We focused on test based upon simple enzyme - inhibitor reaction . The speciﬁc feature of G - actin to inhibit DNAse I allows us to quantitatively count the ratio of F - actin to G - actin and statistically elaborate the inﬂuence of apelin on this parameter . Moreover , the ratio of F : G actin was examined in cytosol—the most dynamic fraction of cell , what was important for examining the dynamic reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton after apelin treatment . In colon cancer cells apelin peptides increased F : G actin ratio , which suggests that apelin shifted the actin balance onto actin polymerisation in tested cells . These ﬁndings are consistent with previous results ; intense blebs formation after apelin treatment is correlated with actin polymerisation . However , even more intense effect on F : G actin ratio was observed after APJ antagonist stimulation . To explain these observations , we checked the level of coﬁlin . This actin - binding protein is involved in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement [ 51 ] . The connection with apelin - 13 and coﬁlin was previously revealed by Lv et al . In human lung adenocarcinoma cells , this peptide induced cell migration through PAK - 1 / coﬁlin - dependent pathway [ 19 ] . We observed an increase in the F : G ratio after APJ antagonist treatment , which could be due to disorders in actin organisation caused by the decrease in coﬁlin level . A similar effect was observed by Popow - Wo´zniak et al . , who examined the inﬂuence of constitutively inactive coﬁlin on migration and actin dynamics of LS180 cells . Cells expressing constitutively inactive coﬁlin were characterized by elevated actin polymerization state , as well as decreased ability to migrate . The authors suggested that it could be connected with the inability to depolymerize the actin ﬁlament as a result of a reduced amount of monomeric actin in favour of ﬁlamentous actin . Perturbations in actin dynamics explain the decreased migration abilities of colon cancer cells [ 52 ] . Invasion of cancer cells is tightly connected with its proteolytic abilities . Cancer cells secrete proteases that degrade ECM , clearing the way for the metastasis [ 53 ] . Therefore , we checked the effect of apelin on proteolytic enzyme activity in colon cancer cells . For this purpose , we decided to use FITC - conjugated gelatine assay . Our results suggested that apelin increased the number of cells degrading gelatine , which was also conﬁrmed quantitatively . One of the group of enzymes , that play a key role in metastasis by degrading ECM is the metalloproteases . MT1 - MMP ( MMP - 14 ) may degrade the ECM composed of different components , including collagens type - I , - II and – III , ﬁbronectin , vitronectin , laminin - 1 , ﬁbrin , aggrecan , versican , perlecan , casein , nidogen , serpins and tenascin - C [ 53 – 55 ] . Only four members of the MMPs ( MMP - 1 , MMP - 8 , MMP - 13 and MT1 - MMP ) can degrade ﬁbrillar collagens in their triple - helical domain which leave the molecules thermally unstable so that they unwind to form gelatine after which they can be degraded by other members of the MMP family . However , MT1 - MMP is also able to degrade gelatine [ 56 ] . Due to the fact that we observed the effect of apelin treatment on proteolytic activities in FITC - conjugated gelatine assay and in gastric cancer cell lines where apelin treatment stimulated the protein level of MMPs [ 21 ] , we visualised MT1 - MMP - membrane - anchored MMP using immunocytochemistry . This MMP localised as small dots on the cell membrane surface , thus we were able to count the number of ﬂuorescent spots . Our ﬁndings revealed that apelin peptides increased the number of MT1 - MMP positive signals . All these data suggest that apelin peptides increase colon cancer cell migration through stimulation of proteolytic enzyme activity . APJ antagonist ML221 , used in our study as an additional control , revealed interesting ﬁndings . Incubation of colon cancer cells with APJ antagonist resulted in decreased migration and invasion , as well as a reduced number of cells forming blebs . This opposite effect in comparison to apelin treatment indicated that inhibition of apelin receptor and its downstream signalling may affect the Cells 2018 , 7 , 113 14 of 17 capability of cancer cells to migrate . In line with our results it is a small evidence that ML221 decreased migration and invasion abilities of cholangiocarcinoma cell lines . Moreover , it also reduced tumour growth in vivo [ 54 ] . The opposite effect of ML221 obtained during migration and invasion assay was not observed pending proteolytic activity examination . Many studies and our research indicate that apelin peptides inﬂuence some cellular processes , such as proliferation , migration and invasion . However , the mechanism of its action is still unknown . It could be the result of the presence of more than one apelin receptor . The most known and established apelin receptor is APJ , which belongs to the G protein - coupled receptor family [ 6 ] . This huge family includes more than 700 proteins , including 200 orphan receptors [ 55 ] . All of them are 7 - transmembrane proteins sharing several structural features . Since Tatemoto et al . found apelin as a ligand for orphan APLNR [ 4 ] , several mechanisms including signalling pathways were examined [ 7 ] . The latest data indicated that the orphan G protein - coupled receptor 25 also could be activated by apelin in non - mammalian vertebrates [ 56 ] . This new ﬁnding suggests that orphan receptors could be still potentially activated by apelin . Interestingly , APJ antagonist ML221 could also inhibit other receptors , including kappa opioid or the benzodiazepinone receptors [ 47 ] . Thereupon , the data are still inconsistent and controversial and it could be difﬁcult to examine mechanism of apelin’s action . As such , further studies are needed . 5 . Conclusions In summary , our studies indicate that apelin increases the migration and invasion abilities of colon cancer cells by several possible mechanisms . Here , for the ﬁrst time , we examined and compared a panel of four different apelin peptides in all experiments . All tested peptides displayed similar activity , which can be connected with sharing the same sequence on the C - end of their structure . Overall , apelin stimulated migratory protrusions formation , and affected actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and the proteolytic abilities of examined cells . These ﬁndings indicate that there is a connection between apelin and carcinogenesis and cancer spreading . The inﬂuence of tumour environment , including adipose tissue secreting apelin , on colon cancer development could be an interesting future research area and a promising target for the establishment of novel anti - cancer therapy .
