This “imprinting” behavior is an example of infant learning and is elicited by visual and / or auditory cues . Visual information of imprinting stimuli in chicks is ﬁrst processed in the visual Wulst ( VW ) , a telencephalic area corresponding to the mammalian visual cortex , congregates in the core region of the hyper - pallium densocellulare ( HDCo ) cells , and transmitted to the intermediate medial mesopallium ( IMM ) , a region similar to the mammalian association cortex . The imprinting memory is stored in the IMM , and activities of IMM neurons are altered by imprinting . Imprinting also induces functional and structural plastic changes of neurons in the circuit that links the VW and the IMM . Of these neurons , the activity of the HDCo cells is strongly inﬂu - enced by imprinting . Expression and modulation of NR2B subunit - containing N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors in the HDCo cells are crucial for plastic changes in this circuit as well as the process of visual imprint - ing . Thus , elucidation of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the plastic changes that occurred in the HDCo cells may provide useful knowledge about infant learning . Key words : chick imprinting , neural activation , NR2B subunit , visual Wulst . Introduction Newborn precocial birds , such as geese , ducks , and chickens can memorize the shapes and calls of their parents , and follow them . Interestingly , they can show the same behavior against a non - parental object , including non - living objects if they are appropriately displayed . This special behavior , called “imprinting” , is an important form of childhood learning ( Lorenz 1937 ) . Lorenz reported that when goslings saw the experi - menter as the ﬁrst thing at hatching , they immediately memorized his ﬁgure and imprinted to him . This imprinting behavior can even last into adulthood . Therefore , imprinting behavior has features that distin - guish it from general learning and memory : high learn - ing efﬁciency and robust memory retention . The imprinting memory of nestlings can only be acquired within a limited period after hatching , called the “critical period” ( known also as “sensitive period” ) . In general , neurons in the juvenile brain exhibit high activity and plasticity . Children have a high capacity to adapt to their external environment , and a strong abil - ity to acquire new functions and skills . Neural plasticity in infancy has been studied in the visual ( Wiesel & Hu - bel 1965 ; Antonini & Stryker 1993 ) and somatosensory ( Van Der Loos & Woolsey 1973 ; Woolsey & Wann 1976 ) cortices . However , cellular and molecular mech - anisms of learning in infancy have not yet been fully clariﬁed , because the number of available animal mod - els is limited . Among them , imprinting behavior in chicks is a suitable model for investigating the neural basis of plastic changes that occur during juvenile learning . Most physiological and histological analyses investi - gating neural changes during visual imprinting have focused on the intermediate medial mesopallium ( IMM ; previously referred to as the intermediate medial hyper - striatum ventrale ) , a telencephalic region that has a similar function to the mammalian association cortex * Author to whom all correspondence should be addressed .

The IMM was necessary for acqui - sition and retention of imprinting memory , and a lesion of the IMM inhibited these processes of imprinting ( Horn et al . 1983 ; Johnson & Horn 1986 ) . Spontane - ous ﬁring rates in IMM neurons were higher in strongly imprinted chicks than weakly imprinted chicks ( Brad - ford & McCabe 1994 ) . The IMM neurons responding to the imprinting stimuli increased in number ( Mclen - nan & Horn 1992 ; Horn et al . 2001 ) and the amplitude of responses was elevated after imprinting ( Brown & Horn 1994 ; Nicol et al . 1995 ) . These physiological studies suggest that imprinting alters the neural activity of a subset of neurons in the IMM to enhance transduction of speciﬁc information , and reduce trans - duction of irrelevant information . Exposure to the imprinting stimulus increased expression of both mRNA and the products of immediate early genes , cFos , zenk , and Arc / arg3 . 1 in IMM neurons ( McCabe & Horn 1994 ; Suge et al . 2010 ; Yamaguchi et al . 2010 ) . In addition , increases in the phosphorylation of the myristoylated alanine - rich C kinase substrate and in the activation of calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II in the IMM were found to be induced by imprinting ( Sheu et al . 1993 ; Solomonia et al . 2005 ) . Imprinting also enhanced the expression of neural cell adhesion molecules , microtubule - associated protein 2 , and clathrin heavy chain ( Solomonia et al . 1997 ; Solo - monia et al . 1998 ; Yamaguchi et al . 2008 ) . Several morphological studies reported that imprinting induced an increase in the size of the postsynaptic density of spine synapses and elongation of the synaptic apposi - tion zone in the IMM ( Bradley et al . 1981 ; Horn et al . 1985 ) . These reports indicate that visual imprinting enhances neural activity , facilitates synaptic transmis - sion , and changes synapse morphology in the IMM . Telencephalic neural networks essential for visual imprinting What is the mechanism of perception and processing of visual information about imprinting stimulus ? Birds possess two parallel pathways for processing visual information ( Fig . 1A ) . In one of the circuits , called the tectofugal pathway , visual information from the retina is transmitted to the nucleus rotundus in the thalamus via the optic tectum , and then sent to a telencephalic region called the entopallium ( traditionally referred to as the ectostriatum ) ( Deng & Rogers 1999 ; Mey & Thanos 2000 ) . The tectofugal pathway is regarded as a neural circuit essential for recognition of colors , shapes , and motions of objects ( Hodos & Karten 1970 ; Watanabe 1996 ; Luksch et al . 1998 ) . Another neural circuit for processing visual informa - tion is the thalamofugal pathway , which includes the ( A ) ( B ) Fig . 1 . Two visual pathways and the visual Wulst - intermediate medial mesopallium ( VW - IMM ) circuit . ( A ) Diagram of the tectofu - gal and thalamofugal pathways in the chick brain ( sagittal view ) . In the tectofugal pathway ( red lines ) , visual information is con - veyed from the retina to the entopallium in the telencephalon via the optic tectum and nucleus rotundus ( Rot ) in the thalamus . The VW receives afferent connections from the retina via the nucleus dorsolateralis anterior of the thalamus ( DLA ) and this constitutes the thalamofugal pathway ( blue lines ) . ( B ) The neural pathway from the interstitial nucleus of the hyperpallium apicale ( IHA ) to the IMM . The visual information is transmitted in this order : the rostral part of the hyperpallium densocellulare ( HDR ) , the core region of the HD ( HDCo ) , and the periventricular part of the HD ( HDPe ) . These neural connections , named the VW - IMM circuit , are essential for the process of imprinting . ª 2012 The Authors Development , Growth & Differentiation ª 2012 Japanese Society of Developmental Biologists Neural basis of imprinting behavior 199 visual Wulst ( VW ) of the telencephalon . The VW exhib - its some similarities with the mammalian visual cortex ( Reiner et al . 2004 ) . This pathway is known to be important for visual learning ( Mey & Thanos 2000 ) , although partial destruction of this circuit including the VW does not block vision in chicks ( McCabe et al , 1981 ) . It is reported that the VW plays a crucial role in the process of visual imprinting based on the results obtained with in vivo optical recordings ( details are described below ) as well as lesion experiment ( Maeka - wa et al . 2006 ) . The interstitial nucleus of the hyperpal - lium apicale ( IHA ) , located in the dorsal part of the VW , receives afferent connections from the retina via the nucleus dorsolateralis anterior of the thalamus ( DLA ) ( Karten et al . 1973 ; Watanabe et al . 1983 ) . The affer - ent neural connections from the nidopallium and arco - pallium ( formerly referred to as the archistriatum , which is partially similar to the amygdala ) into the VW have also been reported ( Deng & Rogers 2000 ) . The IMM receives afferent connections from several brain regions , such as the optic tectum , hippocampus , amygdala , and some areas in the nidopallium ( Bradley et al . 1985 ; Davies et al . 1997 ) . The information inte - grated in the IMM is mainly transmitted to the amyg - dala , then to a dopaminergic nucleus , the medial striatum ( MSt , formerly referred to as the lobus parol - factorius ) ( Bradley et al . 1985 ; Davies et al . 1997 ; Schnabel et al . 1997 ; Csillag 1999 ; Matsushima et al . 2001 ; Metzger et al . 2002 ) . The amygdala and MSt are crucial for imprinting ( Lowndes et al . 1994 ; Izawa et al . 2001 ) , and some regions of the nidopallium receive input from the dopaminergic neurons of the MSt ( Schnabel et al . 1997 ; Metzger et al . 2002 ) . Thus , although the afferent pathways into the VW and the efferent pathways from the IMM are well deﬁned , the anatomical connection between the VW and IMM were only recently clariﬁed . A recent study revealed the neural circuit from the VW to IMM , essential for the process of memory for - mation in imprinting ( Nakamori et al . 2010 ) . Using his - tological analysis with biotinylated dextran amine , an anterograde tracer , and cholera toxin subunit B ( CTb ) , a retrograde tracer , it is found that in the VW , visual information reached the rostral part of the hyperpallium densocellulare ( HDR ; Fig . 1B ) . Information then con - verged on excitatory neurons in the ventrocaudal region of the VW . This region is considered to be the output area of the VW , and is named the core region of the HD ( HDCo ) . HDCo neurons project to the peri - ventricular part of the HD ( HDPe ) , the caudal area of the telencephalon near the hippocampus , by sending long axons through the HD layer . In addition , HDPe neurons send afferent ﬁbers into the IMM . The neural pathway of the opposite direction from the IMM to VW is not observed except for bidirectional pathways between the HDCo and HDPe . The physiological activity of this neural circuit ( the VW - IMM circuit ) was demonstrated using multiple - site optical imaging techniques with acute brain slices . Sagittal brain slices were prepared from P1 chicks and subjected to optical imaging of neural activity . Slices were attached to the bottom of a plastic chamber and stained with a voltage - sensitive merocyanine - rhoda - nine dye , NK2761 ( Kamino et al . 1981 ; Salzberg et al . 1983 ; Obaid et al . 1985 ) . The optical signals were recorded using a photodiode array with 464 channels ( Miyakawa et al . 2003 ; Momose - Sato et al . 2004 ) . When the HDR region was electrically stimulated , the optic signal was transmitted to the IMM via the HDCo and HDPe . Pharmacological analysis using selective antagonists for glutamate receptors revealed the exis - tence of glutamatergic synapses in the HDCo and HDPe . These anatomical and physiological studies indicate that visual information is ﬁrst transmitted into the IHA layer of VW , processed in the VW , then gath - ered to the HDCo neurons , and ﬁnally conveyed to IMM neurons via HDPe cells . Neural changes induced by visual imprinting In contrast to IMM neurons , the physiological role of VW neurons on visual imprinting was demonstrated only recently . Lesions of HDCo neurons with restricted injection of ibotenic acid resulted in impaired visual imprinting . These results suggest that information pro - cessing through the VW - IMM circuit , which depends on activities of HDCo neurons , is crucial for the suc - cess of visual imprinting . Traditional stimuli for imprinting chicks or ducks in the laboratory include stuffed hens , balls or boxes , which are typically rotated , illuminated , and presented in conjunction with parental calls ( Horn 2004 ) . A sim - pler presentation method of imprinting stimuli was required to investigate the molecular and behavioral mechanism of the imprinting process . Computer - gen - erated moving images such as a red circle or a blue square on a monitor could imprint chicks ( Maekawa et al . 2006 ) . In each training session , a chick was placed in a running wheel connected to a custom - made computer system , and exposed to a horizontally - moving image on a liquid crystal display ( Fig . 2A ) . An imprinting training that lasted more than 20 - min caused chicks to approach the training stimulus ( Fig . 2B ) . In addition , chicks were more likely to follow an image that had the same color but a different shape , com - pared with the training stimulus . On the other hand , imprinted chicks did not approach different colored images , and sometimes even actively avoided them , ª 2012 The Authors Development , Growth & Differentiation ª 2012 Japanese Society of Developmental Biologists 200 T . Nakamori et al . regardless what kind of shape the image was . Thus , these ﬁndings indicated that color is the most important factor for discriminating an imprinted two - dimensional image . Without training , chicks neither approached nor escaped from a speciﬁc image . These results indicate that new neural circuits are organized in the brain of imprinted chicks , which are necessary for responding to relevant stimulus for eliciting imprint - ing behavior . The effects of imprinting on neural activity in the VW were investigated using in vivo intrinsic optical imaging techniques ( Maekawa et al . 2006 ) . Intrinsic imaging was performed using a differential video acquisition system via a charge - coupled device camera ﬁtted to the tandem lens of the microscope ( Ratzlaff & Grinvald 1991 ) . The neural response of the VW to colored mov - ing images on a monitor located within the chick’s visual ﬁeld was detected . This image was the same as that used for the previous behavioral experiments . In un - imprinted chicks , responses were observed in a wide area of the VW , irrespective of the color of the presented images ( Fig . 3A left ) . In chicks that were imprinted to a blue square , the peaks of response to the blue stimulus were detected in both the anterior and posterior parts of the VW , and the response in the middle area of the VW was smaller than that of the untrained chicks ( Fig . 3A right ) . Moreover , in these chicks , the response to a red image ( a novel stimulus ) was detected only in the posterior region . The anatom - ical evidence of the neural circuit in the VW described above suggests that the anterior and posterior response areas may correspond to the HDR and IHA , respectively . In addition , these results suggest that the area responding to color stimuli in imprinting is reﬁned so that visual information related to the imprinting stim - ulus can be accurately transmitted to HDCo cells . Visual imprinting concomitantly induces structural changes in neural networks from the IHA to HDR , enhancing signal transduction relevant to imprinting stimuli and reducing other activity . And it is possible that imprinting alters transmission efﬁciency of visual information through affecting the activity of inhibitory neurons in the VW , as in the case for the visual cortex plasticity ( Fagiolini & Hensch 2000 ; Morales et al . 2002 ) . Additional study is required to clarify this point . Conducting in vivo optical imaging of neural activity in the VW - IMM circuit beyond the HDCo is technically challenging , because the HDCo and IMM are located in the deep layer of the telencephalon . Therefore , neu - ral activity in the VW - IMM circuit was examined using acute brain slices ( Nakamori et al . 2010 ) . Electrical stimulation at HDR of slices prepared from un - imprinted post hatching day 1 ( P1 ) chicks reared in quasi - dark induced signal transduction from the VW to the IMM via the HDCo ( Fig . 3B ) . In contrast , the signal did not propagate in P7 slices prepared from un - imprinted chicks reared in the same condition . The reason for this impairment of signal transduction assessed by optical recordings is not clear . The signal might become too weak to be detected by this method . Since selective neuronal cell death or axon loss were not observed , alteration of the structure of dendrites , decreased number of synapse or decreased synaptic function of HDCo cells might affect the signal transduction . On the other hand , in P7 slices prepared ( A ) ( B ) Fig . 2 . Demonstration of visual imprinting in chicks . ( A ) Experi - mental apparatus used to quantify imprinting behavior . Horizon - tally moving images are presented on a liquid crystal monitor . Chicks are individually placed in the running wheel , and the num - ber of forwards and backwards rotations is recorded . ( B ) Repre - sentative behavioral patterns of imprinted chicks . After training , chicks approached the image that was the same color as the training stimulus , and avoided other - colored images . ª 2012 The Authors Development , Growth & Differentiation ª 2012 Japanese Society of Developmental Biologists Neural basis of imprinting behavior 201 from imprinted chicks after being trained at P1 , although the total response area to an electrical stimu - lation was smaller than P1 slices , a reﬁned signal transduction linking the VW and IMM was observed . Chicks exhibited imprinting behavior when the training was performed between P1 and P4 , but not beyond P4 ( Nakamori et al . 2010 ) . Accordingly , in this para - digm , the critical period of imprinting lasted at least from P1 to P4 , closing at P5 . Considering this fact , these results indicate that the signal transduction from the VW to IMM is facilitated during the critical period but weakens thereafter , when chicks are reared in quasi - dark conditions . However , once imprinting mem - ory was consolidated , signal transduction was limited in the VW - IMM circuit and neural activity of the path - way was maintained even after the critical period ( Fig . 4A ) . The precise location of activated neurons cannot be determined using optical imaging methods because of the limited resolution . To resolve this problem , histo - logical analysis at the cellular level was performed . The immediate early gene cfos was used as a marker for activated neurons . CTb was injected in the HDPe to enable the identiﬁcation of HDCo cells at the time of histological analysis . Chicks were trained at P1 , and re - exposed to the same stimulus at P7 . Histological analysis revealed that the activated HDCo cells upon re - exposure to the stimulus at P7 expressed both cFos and CTb . The number of double - positive cells was higher in chicks imprinted at P1 compared with un - imprinted chicks . In addition , an increase in the number of activated cells was observed in the HDPe and IMM , downstream of the HDCo in the neural cir - cuit . In contrast , imprinting had no effect on the induc - tion of cFos in the DLA and dorsal VW , afferent to the HDCo . These results suggest that changes in activity of the HDCo neurons play a pivotal role in the activa - tion of the VW - IMM circuit and in visual imprinting . Changes in the efﬁciency of synaptic transmission may underlie this plastic change in HDCo neurons . To clar - ify this point , it is necessary to understand the effects of imprinting on the expression of neurotransmitters and their receptors , which participate actively in the synaptic transduction . ( A ) ( B ) Fig . 3 . Observation of neural plastic changes induced by imprinting using in vivo and in vitro optical imaging techniques . ( A ) Diagram of signals detected by in vivo optical imaging of the visual Wulst ( VW ) . Intrinsic optical signals are obtained when chicks watch colored images on the monitor . In untrained chicks , the response patterns to both blue and red squares are similar , extending from the interstitial nucleus of the hyperpallium apicale ( IHA ) to the rostral part of the hyperpallium densocellulare ( HDR ) ( blue and red arrows ) . In chicks trained with a blue square , strong responses to the blue stimulus were detected in the IHA and HDR , while the responses in the inter - mediate area of these two regions were small . In contrast , the area responsive to the red square was restricted to the IHA . ( B ) In optical imaging analysis with acute brain slices , we can observe sequential changes of membrane potential from the VW to the IMM ( red area ) , which are induced by electrical stimulation of the HDR . This reﬂects signal transduction from the VW to the IMM ( black arrow ) in P1 chicks . In untrained P7 chicks , the similarly evoked signal cannot be conveyed beyond the core region of the hyperpallium densocellu - lare ( HDCo ) . However , in P7 chicks that experienced imprinting training at P1 and retained imprinting memory , reﬁned signal transduc - tion linking the VW and IMM is observed . ª 2012 The Authors Development , Growth & Differentiation ª 2012 Japanese Society of Developmental Biologists 202 T . Nakamori et al . Roles of neurotransmitters and their receptors in neural changes induced by imprinting The roles of various neurotransmitters and their recep - tors in imprinting have mainly been analyzed by mea - suring released neurotransmitters during imprinting and by examining the inhibitory effects of receptor antagonists on learning . It has been reported that imprinting potentiates the release of noradrenalin , glu - tamate , acetylcholine , gamma - aminobutyric acid , and taurine in the IMM ( Davies et al . 1983 ; Tsukada et al . 1999 ; McCabe et al . 2001 ; Meredith et al . 2004 ) . Imprinting also enhanced the number of VW cells expressing a neuropeptide , cholecystokinin ( CCK ) . In addition , an inhibitor of cholecystokinin receptor was found to disturb memory formation ( Maekawa et al . 2007 ) . Most cells expressing CCK were glutamatergic neurons and cFos positive CCK neurons were increased by imprinting training . Moreover , visual train - ing after closure of the critical period did not increase neurons that were double - positive for CCK mRNA and cFos products . These results indicate that the activa - tion of CCK cells in the VW is crucial for the acquisi - tion of visual imprinting . The search for the roles of N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors ( NMDAR ) , one of the subtypes of glutamate receptors , is important for elucidating the molecular mechanism of plastic changes in the HDCo , because NMDAR - dependent synaptic modiﬁcation , such as long - term potentiation , is widely considered to represent the underlying mechanism of learning and memory ( Malenka & Nicoll 1999 ) . It is known that the activity of NMDARs in the IMM is enhanced after imprinting ( McCabe & Horn 1991 ; McCabe & Horn 1988 ) , and that treatment of the IMM with NMDAR antagonist inhibits the formation of imprinting memory ( McCabe et al . 1992 ) . NMDARs are heteromeric assemblies of NR1 and NR2 subunits . Functional dif - ferences between NMDARs arise from differences in NR2 subunits . In mouse and rat , NR2B - containing NMDARs ( NR2B / NR1 ) outnumber NR2A - containing NMDARs ( NR2A / NR1 ) early in development , but the ratio of NR2B to NR2A reduces with age ( Watanabe et al . 1993 ; Monyer et al . 1994 ; Sheng et al . 1994 ) . In the chick HDCo , NR2B expression dominated NR2A in P1 , but the NR2A subunit became the major NR2 component of NMDARs at P7 ( Nakamori et al . 2010 ; Fig . 4B ) . These ﬁndings suggest that the expression level of the NR2B subunit restricts the duration of the critical period . Since the NR2B / NR1 exhibits a longer excitatory postsynaptic potential than NR2A / NR1 , it is optimal for detecting synaptic coincidence ( Monyer et al . 1994 ) . Thus , it is predicted that during the ﬁrst few days after hatching in chicks , neural activation and memory acquisition would be facilitated due to the dominance of NR2B / NR1 expression . Are expressions of NR2 subunits changed by imprinting ? Expression of NR2B was increased after imprinting training at P1 , and then decreased with age . In contrast , expression of NR2A was not changed immediately after imprinting training . As the switching of expression from NR2B to NR2A proceeded devel - opmentally , NR2A expression was found to be more enhanced in imprinted compared with un - imprinted chicks at P7 . In addition , when NMDARs or NR2B / NR1 in HDCo cells were inhibited with antagonists during imprinting training , not only memory acquisition but also enhancement of the VW - IMM circuit was impaired . These results indicate that postsynaptic NR2B / NR1 in HDCo cells is essential for the process of imprinting and activation of neurons in the VW - IMM ( A ) ( B ) Fig . 4 . Developmental and experience - dependent neural changes in chicks . ( A ) Chicks can be imprinted only before P4 . The critical period of imprinting in our system is considered to end at P4 . During the critical period , the VW - IMM circuit is acti - vated . The width of response area decreases with age . Imprinting maintains activity in the visual Wulst - intermediate medial mes - opallium ( VW - IMM ) circuit even after the critical period . ( B ) In the core region of the hyperpallium densocellulare ( HDCo ) at P1 , NR2B is dominant over NR2A , and imprinting training increases NR2B expression . The expression of NR2B decreases with age , and NR2A becomes the major component of the N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors ( NMDAR ) . ª 2012 The Authors Development , Growth & Differentiation ª 2012 Japanese Society of Developmental Biologists Neural basis of imprinting behavior 203 circuit . We hypothesize that imprinting stimuli elevate intracellular Ca 2 + concentration in HDCo cells through activation of NR2B / NR1 . In addition , we propose that the increment of intracellular Ca 2 + changes the mor - phology of synapses and enhances the efﬁciency of synaptic transmission . Consequently , neural activation of the VW - IMM circuit can be induced . In this way , robust memory can be acquired even with a short training period . Conclusion Our experimental evidence suggests that the process of visual imprinting involves remodeling of neural net - works in the VW and activation of HDCo neurons . In addition , we demonstrated that the activity of postsyn - aptic NR2B / NR1in HDCo cells was essential for both the acquisition and retention of imprinting memory . However , the mechanism by which the process of imprinting activates NR2B / NR1 and the cellular and molecular outcomes of this activation remain unclear . To elucidate this issue , it will be necessary to investi - gate the role of NR2B / NR1 on neural plastic changes at the single cell level , and to investigate the effects of modiﬁed NR2B / NR1 expression on memory acquisi - tion and storage . Real - time observation of neural activity during learn - ing may be an ideal method for understanding neural plastic changes induced by learning . Imprinting stimuli induce structural and functional changes of neural net - works within a brief time - period . In particular , changes in the activity of HDCo cells are considered to be criti - cally important for the acquisition of imprinting mem - ory . Thus , in vivo recording of HDCo cells during the process of imprinting learning could provide an oppor - tunity to observe neural changes in real - time . We previously conducted in vivo recording of neural responses to visual stimuli ( Maekawa et al . 2006 ) , and demonstrated plastic changes of neural activity in HDCo cells in acute brain slices ( Nakamori et al . 2010 ) . Additional electrophysiological techniques combined with our in vivo recording system may be a valuable next step . References Antonini , A . & Stryker , M . P . 1993 .
