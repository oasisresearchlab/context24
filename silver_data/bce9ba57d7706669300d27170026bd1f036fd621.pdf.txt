Prior studies are unclear about whether oral or written communication is the most advantageous to support creative activities within virtual teams and especially those who interact within MUVEs ( Dennis & Williams , 2003 ; Paulus , 2000 ) . In our research , 66 students were asked to perform a creative task in a MUVE , in groups of 3 people . The comparison of their performance , according to the communication modalities , suggests that oral communication triggers more numerous and original ideas . Author Keywords Creativity ; multi - user virtual environment ; computer mediated communication . ACM Classification Keywords Experimentation ; performance ; measurement . PROBLEM STATEMENT AND HYPOTHESIS Multi - User Virtual Environments and Collaborative Virtual Environments ( CVE ) are interesting topics at a time when teleworking is democratized in most professional sectors . Teams are increasingly geographically distant , which lead them to work across time and space ( Bell & Kozlowski , 2002 ; Maznevski & Chudoba , 2000 ) . The impact of such environments in collaborative activities has been the subject of various research in cognitive psychology and ergonomics , especially on learning tasks ( Benford , Greenhalgh , Rodden & Pycock , 2001 ; deNoyelles & Kyeong - Ju Seo , 2012 ; Vosinakis & Koutsabasis , 2013 ) and information retrieval ( González - Ibáñez , Haseki , & Shah , 2013 ) . Some studies on the use of MUVE in collaborative creative tasks point out the advantage of virtual environments ( such as Second Life ) in problem solving activities requiring creativity ( Cornelius , Nguyen , Hayes , & Makena , 2013 ; Ferguson , 2011 ; Larach & Cabra , 2010 ) . But still very few studies have , to our knowledge , analyzed the impact of communication modalities of MUVE in collaborative creative tasks . A current challenge in today’s society is to satisfy an increasing need for creativity and innovation . Creative teams have to remain competitive , by regularly coming up with new ideas , concepts or products . Many authors agree on a definition of creativity , namely the ability to produce observable ideas that are both original and adapted to the context ( Amabile , 1996 ; Bonnardel , 2002 ; Isaken , Murdock , Firestein & Treffinger , 1993 ; Lubart , 1994 ; Lubart et al . , 2003 ; Sternberg , 1999 ) . From the first tests measuring creativity , such as the ‘Torrance test of creative thinking’ ( TTCT , Torrance , 1976 ) , to more recent models of creativity , such as the ‘multivaried approach’ to creativity ( Lubart , 2005 ) , divergent thinking is the main ability involved in creative cognitive processes we can measure to predict individual and team creative potential . Divergent thinking is the ability to generate a large amount of ideas when confronting a problem , which would increase the probability of reaching creative ideas ( Guilford , 1956 ) . As in most Computer Mediated Communication ( CMC ) , exchanges between users in a virtual environment may occur in three distinct modalities : text , audio and image ( Anderson & Elloumi , 2004 ) , as well as combinations of thereof like in videos ( i . e . audio and image ) . Groupware ( GW ) , is the name given to software designed to support collaboration of distant groups ( Kalika , Reix , Fallery , & Rowe , 2011 ) . Such groupware can provide the users with rich CMC including some or all of the following communication modalities : video , audio , text , image , sketch , documents sharing and joint authoring . Some authors have already performed experiments studying design activities of groups interacting with video - conferencing GW ( Vyas , Van Der Veer , Nijholt , & Heylen , Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page .

CVEs have the potential to include all synchronous and asynchronous types of CMC , providing richer communication than traditional electronic collaboration methods ( Davis , Murphy , Owens , Khazanchi , & Zigurs , 2009 ) . But for now , technical constraints , such as network restrictions , compatibility problems or screen resolution , make the textual modality ( electronic writing ) still the most used communication mode in virtual environments and , broadly , in CMC . Since the 1990s , Internet communication platforms and electronic writing have been increasingly used . In a virtual environment , many benefits are associated with this form of digital written communication ( Alwi , Adams & Newton , 2012 ) : it allows people to rethink and evaluate written ideas before posting them , to go back to exchanged messages and so to clarify the meaning of formulations that could cause problems of interpretation . With similar arguments , the " writing " , which consists in getting participants from one group produce their ideas in written form , is proposed as an efficient method to generate new ideas in creative design tasks ( VanGundy , 1984 ; Paulus & Yang , 2000 ) . However , virtual worlds are specific virtual environments where the presence of avatars can simulate modalities of oral communication , such as visualization of the participants , their locations and their non - verbal communication ( gestures , eye - contact , and facial expressions ) . If this type of rich communication may be beneficial , according to some authors , the proliferation of visual information conveyed by both images and text , is likely to cause interference and cognitive overload ( Mayer , 2003 ; Paulus , 2000 ) . So the question is whether written communication or oral communication is the most appropriate in virtual environments . Oral communication could be the source of most immediate exchanges , which is possibly more effective . By comparing the impact of written and oral communication modalities , our research will hopefully contribute to increasing knowledge and proposing principles to assist in the design and optimization of MUVE dedicated to collaborative creative activities . In this paper , we present an experiment that explores the impact of different communication modalities within MUVE on collective creative performance . METHODOLOGY In this study , 66 students ( age : M = 19 . 4 , SD = 1 . 6 ) enrolled in psychology license were invited to perform a creative task , in groups of 3 people , according to the brainstorming paradigm ( Osborn , 1957 ) . Participants had 25 minutes to generate a maximum of ideas to reduce traffic jams in Aix - en - Provence city ( France ) . They were placed in identical separate rooms and met as avatars in a virtual environment created within Second Life , replicating a meeting room . The 22 groups were divided according to two conditions where communication modalities varied :  Written Communication by instant messaging system ( WC ) : 11 groups  Oral Communication by audio chat system ( OC ) : 11 groups Before beginning the task , participants were asked to read a tutorial and to perform simple tasks in the virtual environment , in order to learn the main procedures they would have to use during the experiment . At the end of the experiment , we identified ‘unique’ ideas generated by analyzing records of the 22 creative sessions . An idea was considered as unique , and was noted as such , when it was cited for the first time in a single group session . By doing so , an idea can only be generated once in a group , but two groups can generate the same idea , which allow us to compute the occurrence frequency of an idea within the tested population ( i . e . statistical originality ) and the number of unique ideas generated by each group ( i . e . its fluency ) . RESULTS When analyzing results , we focused on two dependent variables , which correspond to divergent thinking cues :  The number of unique ideas generated by each group ( fluency ) .  The average statistical originality of unique ideas generated by the group ( originality ) . A first t - test allowed us to observe that OC groups generated significantly more ideas ( M = 25 . 09 , SD = 7 . 33 ) than WC groups ( M = 15 . 45 , SD = 3 . 32 ) ; t ( 20 ) = - 3 . 97 , p < . 001 ( Figure 1 ) . Figure 1 : Number of ideas generated by groups in WC vs OC . A second t - test allowed us to observe that OC groups generated ideas with significantly higher originality ( M = 0 . 62 , SD = 0 . 08 ) than WC groups ( M = 0 . 55 , SD = 0 . 07 ) ; t ( 20 ) = - 2 . 22 , p < . 05 ( Figure 2 ) . Figure 2 . Average originality of ideas generated by groups in WC vs . OC . DISCUSSION The analysis of productions gathered during a creative task within a MUVE allowed us to show that the chosen mode of communication ( oral vs . written ) impacts groups’ creative performance . Oral communication seems to trigger more numerous and original ideas . A first interpretation is that written communication promotes cognitive interference ( Dennis & Williams , 2003 ) . Thus , when participants read the ideas of other participants , their flow of ideas may be interrupted in a particular category ( Baruah & Paulus , 2011 ) . As written communication requests more cognitive resources than oral communication ( Bourdin & Fayol , 1994 ) , high - level processes that are involved in a problem - solving activity or creative design would be more difficult to execute . However , the superiority of oral communication can be surprising if we compare our results with those of previous experiments analyzing creative performance differences in classic brainstorming ( face - to - face meeting with oral communication ) vs . electronic brainstorming ( distant meeting with written communication on instant messaging ) . In these experiments , electronic brainstorming seemed to trigger more numerous ideas than classic brainstorming ( Dennis & Williams , 2003 ; DeRosa , Smith , & Hantula , 2007 ; Paulus , Kohn , Arditti , & Korde , 2013 ) . Therefore , we have to question the reason of the superiority of oral communication in CVE . The partial anonymity induced by the CVE could be a line of thought even if findings suggest that there is no clear superiority in the creative performances when group members are anonymous . Indeed , anonymous groups seem to produce similar amount of ideas , with similar originality and quality compared to groups with identified members ( Connolly , Jessup , & Valacich , 1990 ; Kahai , Sosik , & Avolio , 2003 ) . Authors rather observed changes in the dynamic of communication , such as more participation in the discussion , more criticism toward ideas generated by others , and less satisfaction in anonymous groups ( Haines , Hough , Cao , & Haines , 2014 ; Shepherd , Briggs , Reinig , Yen , & Nunamaker Jr , 1995 ) . To further analyze OC issues in CVE we will compare , in future experiments , the creative outputs of groups communicating only orally ; but this time , half of them will work in " face - to - face " condition while the other half will meet in a CVE . Our aim will be to analyze the impact of para - linguistic cue loss on creative performances and group dynamic . REFERENCES 1 . Amabile , T . M . ( 1996 ) . Creativity in context .
