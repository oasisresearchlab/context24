Folate receptor α ( FR α ) is a folate - binding protein overexpressed on ovarian and several other epithelial malignancies that can be used as a target for imaging and therapeutic strategies . The goal of this study is to improve historical data that lack specific information about FR α expression in rare histological subtypes , primary disease versus metastatic foci , and recurrent disease . Methods . FR α expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on 186 primary and 27 recurrent ovarian tumors , including 24 pairs of samples obtained from the same individuals at diagnosis and at secondary debulking surgery . For 20 of the 186 primaries , simultaneous metastatic foci were also analyzed . FR α staining was analyzed in light of disease morphology , stage , grade , debulking status , and time from diagnosis to recurrence and death . Results . FR α expression was apparent in 134 of 186 ( 72 % ) primary and 22 of 27 ( 81 . 5 % ) recurrent ovarian tumors . In 21 of 24 ( 87 . 5 % ) matched specimens , recurrent tumors reflected the FR α status detected at diagnosis . Metastatic foci were similar to primary tumors in FR α staining . FR α status was not associated with time to recurrence or overall survival in either univariate or multivariable analyses . Conclusion . FR α expression occurs frequently , especially in the common high - grade , high - stage serous tumors that are most likely to recur . New findings from this study show that FR α expression is maintained on metastatic foci and recurrent tumors , suggesting that novel folate - targeted therapies may hold promise for the majority of women with either newly diagnosed or recurrent ovarian cancer . © 2007 Elsevier Inc .

Keywords : Folate receptor ; Ovarian cancer Introduction The folate receptor alpha ( FR α ) is a glycosylphosphatidyl - inositol - linked protein that is overexpressed in several epithelial malignancies , including ovarian , renal , lung , and breast cancers [ 1 ] . While the function of FR α in tumors is unclear , in the kidney it serves as a high - affinity salvage receptor that retrieves folate from the filtrate and returns it via transcytosis to the blood [ 2 ] ; in the brain , it likely concentrates folate in cerebrospinal fluid [ 3 ] . Expression of FR α in normal tissues is restricted to the apical surfaces of polarized epithelial cells [ 4 ] , where it is not exposed to the blood stream . Unlike the more ubiquitously expressed reduced folate carrier and proton - coupled folate transporter that regulate folate homeostasis , FR α allows internalization of folic acid that has been conjugated to low molecular weight com - pounds , proteins , or nanoparticles [ 5 ] . This property has implica - tions for targeting of chemotherapeutic drugs , cytotoxic viruses , or imaging agents to FR α - expressing cells . FR α is an attractive candidate for targeted biologic therapy of ovarian cancer [ 6 , 7 ] . It is reported to be expressed in the majority of non - mucinous epithelial ovarian tumors at levels 10 - to 100 - fold higher than its normal expression in the kidney and on lung and breast epithelial cells [ 8 ] . In addition , FR α is a tumor anti - gen , with 70 % of women with ovarian or breast cancer showing Available online at www . sciencedirect . com Gynecologic Oncology 108 ( 2008 ) 619 – 626 www . elsevier . com / locate / ygyno ⁎ Corresponding author .

The tumor specificity and high levels of FR α expression and the potential to boost immunity to tumors with FR α - specific approaches have generated significant enthusiasm for testing strategies targeting FR α in ovarian cancer patients . For example , MORAb - 003 , a humanized , high - affinity monoclonal antibody against FR α based on the murine LK26 clone , is currently undergoing phase II testing in ovarian cancer patients after showing cell - mediated cytotoxicity , complement - dependent killing , and non - immune mediated , FR α - dependent inhibition of growth under folate - limiting conditions [ 10 ] . What is unknown in attempting to apply novel FR α - based therapeutics is the FR α - expression status of tumors with more rare histologies , the stability of expression of FR α across the multiple sites of disease typically present at diagnosis in ovarian cancer and whether FR α expression is lost or maintained with disease recurrence . In addition , although one investigative team has stated that FR α overexpression is an indicator of platinum resistance in ovarian cancer , the study was small and performed in the pre - taxane era [ 11 ] . We performed this study to define the extent of FR α ex - pression in ovarian cancers of different histologies , grades , and stages and to determine whether FR α status was associated with time to recurrence and overall survival . In addition , we examined multiple metastatic sites from a subset of patients with advanced disease at diagnosis as well as matched samples from patients at diagnosis and subsequent recurrence . Methods Tissues studied Ovarian cancer specimens from women who had surgery at Mayo Clinic Rochester between June 15 , 1991 and June 15 , 2005 were eligible for inclusion in the study . Invasive tumors encompassing serous , endometrioid , clear cell , muci - nous , or mixed morphologies were selected prior to retrieval of any clinical information . Borderline tumors and non - epithelial malignancies were excluded . The specimens chosen for the study were similar to all available patients in this time period in terms of patient age , stage of disease , and grade . There was a difference between the sample set and all available samples in the distribution of tumor morphologies . This was caused by oversampling the rare morphologies , which resulted in ∼ 56 % of the primary tumors studied ( compared to 70 % of all eligible epithelial malignancies ) having serous morphology . The demographic characteristics ofpatientsrepresentedin thisstudyareshown inTable 1 . A totalof 186 cancers from womenwith newly diagnosed ovarian cancer and27samples of recurrent disease comprise the main sample . In addition , FR α expression was analyzed in concomitant primary versus metastatic sites from the initial surgery in a subset of20patientswithstageIIIC orIVdiseasefrom the groupof186primary samples . To examine FR α expression on metastatic foci , paraffin - embedded tumors from the following locations were selected as available : fallopian tube , pelvic sidewall , abdominal wall , omentum , small and large intestine , appendix , spleen , liver , diaphragm , and various lymph nodes . Finally , 24 patients ( again , representingasubsetofthe186primaryand27recurrentsamples ) hadsubsequent secondary debulking surgery from which tissue samples were available , allowing analysis of matched pairs of primary tumors and recurrent disease following chemotherapy . Patients provided informedconsentbasedoninstitutionalpolicy at the time of their cancer diagnosis . This retrospective , minimal risk study was reviewed and approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board . Collection of histologic and clinical data Hematoxylin and eosin - stained slides from the initial surgery were reviewed by a gynecologic pathologist ( GLK ) to confirm disease morphology and grade . Tumors were graded 1 – 4 , representing well - differentiated , moderately differen - tiated , poorly differentiated , or undifferentiated , respectively . Pathology reports and medical records were reviewed to confirm disease staging , which was defined using FIGO guidelines [ 12 ] . The clinical course of the disease was followed for each patient using the medical record . Endpoints represent dates of recurrence , death or dates of last contact . Sample preparation Samples were examined for FR α expression by assessing triplicate 0 . 6 mm coresofformalin - fixed , paraffin - embeddedtumorsintissuemicroarrays ( TMAs ) orslidesmadefromafullparaffinblock . Afteragynecologicpathologistselected appropriate regions of each tumor for core removal , TMAs were manually constructed as described [ 13 ] .

An additionalnegative control was liver tissue on each TMA . Positive controls were ovarian cancer specimens ( not included in this study ) that had previously been identified as expressingFR α usingapolyclonalantibody [ 15 ] . Afterwashingtheslides , signals were detected using the mouse MACH3 system ( Biocare Medical , Walnut Creek , CA ) . Slides were counterstained with Modified Schmidt ' s Hematoxylin and permanently mounted . Image capture and analysis Slides were archived using digital imaging performed using a Bliss “ Virtual Microscopy ” microscope and computer system ( Bacus Laboratories , Lombard , IL ) . The staining intensity ( strong , moderate , weak , or negative ) ( Fig . 1 ) and proportion of FR α - positive cells among the malignant cells were scored inde - pendently on the digital images by two observers who were blinded to all clinical outcome data . For 10 of the 212 samples ( 4 . 7 % ) , divergent scores were obtained . These were reconciled by jointly reviewing the cores in question and coming to a consensus . The proportion of cells positive for FR α expression was categorized into quartiles : N 75 % positive , 51 – 75 % positive , 26 – 50 % positive , and b 25 % positive . Analysis was performed on three cores or slides for the majority ( 56 % ) of patients ; 4 – 12 samples were available for 20 % and b 3 samples for 24 % of the patients . Tumor sampleswere definedas negativewhen there was noevidenceof FR α staining on any examined sample from a given individual . If staining was observed , the patient was classified as having a FR α - positive tumor . Statistical analysis Student ' s t - test for age and Chi - square or Fisher ' s Exact tests for categorical data were used to compare demographic parameters in FR α - positive and FR α - negative tumors . Kaplan – Meier analysis was used to determine whether survival differed between patients with FR α - positive and FR α - negative tumors or different characteristics at diagnosis such as disease stage , grade , tumor morphology , or optimal debulking status ( defined as no tumor nodule N 1 cm remaining ) . Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to evaluate whether individual or multiple factors including FR α status were correlated with time to recurrence or survival . Statistical tests were two sided using a significance level of 5 % . Results Patient and tumor characteristics The median time from diagnosis to date of last contact or death forthe186patientswithnewlydiagnoseddiseasewas43 . 7months ( range of 0 . 2 to 178 months ) , with 122 women in the study being deceased and 64 alive at last follow - up . 159 patients ( 85 . 5 % ) had optimal debulking surgery ; 26 patients ( 14 % ) had unresected tumor larger than 1 cm and 1 patient ' s debulking status could not be determined . Chemotherapy was given to 159 patients ( 85 . 5 % ) ; 18 patients ( 14 with stage I disease ) received no chemotherapy ( 9 . 7 % ) and treatment for 9 patients ( 4 . 8 % ) was unknown . Of the 159 patients who received chemotherapy , 74 . 8 % received a pla - tinum agent in combination with a taxane . The remaining patients , generally those diagnosed before mid - 1994 , received cyclopho - sphamide and a platinum agent . The primary tumors analyzed in this sample set are representative of the typical clinical presen - tation of epithelial ovarian cancer in the distribution of the stage at diagnosis , grade , and patient age [ 16 , 17 , 12 ] ( Tables 1 and 2 ) ; more patients with non - serous tumors were included than would be expected in the population . Folate receptor expression in primary cancers Overall , 72 % ( 134 of 186 ) of patients with newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer had tumors that were positive for FR α expression ( Table 2 ) . Stromal cells were clearly FR α - negative ( Fig . 1 ) . Epithelial cells were uniformly negative in 52 ( 28 % ) patients . Of the positively staining tumors , 123 samples demon - strated moderate or strong FR α expression and only 11 ( 8 . 2 % ) had uniformly weak staining tumors . Scoring extent of positive cells , 80 patients ( 59 . 7 % ) had N 75 % of the cells positive , 36 patients ( 26 . 9 % ) had between 51 % and 75 % of the epithelial Fig . 1 . Weak , moderate , and strong FR α expression . Shown are representative cores of ovarian cancer tissues on TMAs that were scored with weak ( A ) , moderate ( B ) , and strong ( C ) FR α expression after immunohistochemistry using FBP343 antibody . Note that the tumor stroma is negative and malignant epithelial cells are largely positive .

R . Kalli et al . / Gynecologic Oncology 108 ( 2008 ) 619 – 626 cells positive , 10 patients ( 7 . 5 % ) had between 26 % and 50 % of the epithelial cells positive , and 8 patients ( 6 % ) had no more than 25 % of the epithelial cells positive . Because of the low numbers of available tumors with less common morphologies , we compared serous tumors to all other morphologies com - bined , a design with 85 % power to detect a difference of 20 % in the proportion of patients with FR α - positive tumors . Serous tumors were more likely to be FR α - positive than all other morphologies combined ( 81 . 7 % versus 59 . 8 % positive , respec - tively , p b 0 . 001 ) , with 66 . 7 % of endometrioid ( 26 of 39 ) and 63 . 3 % of clear cell ( 19 of 30 ) tumors and only two of nine mucinous tumors expressing FR α . Similarly , high - grade tumors ( 75 . 8 % positive ) were more likely than low - grade tumors ( 48 % positive ) to express FR α ( p = 0 . 004 ) . Tumors from patients with advanced stage disease were slightly more likely to express FR α ( p = 0 . 203 ) ( Table 2 ) . Primary versus simultaneous metastatic foci In considering FR α as a therapeutic target , we examined its expression on primary tumors and concomitant metastatic foci . Thus , twenty patients with stage IIIC or IV disease were selected for additional study . Three to twelve different tumor sites , all obtained at initial surgery , were scored from each of these pa - tients . In this sample , 18 of the 20 patients had tumors that expressed FR α ( see Table 3 for tumor morphology ) . FR α stain - ing was evident in 109 of the 110 sections examined for these 18 patients . Only one of these patients , with a clear cell tumor , had discrepant results . Specifically , of the three blocks available from her disease , there was strong staining in two sites , the ovary and the right para - aortic lymph node , but no staining in a biopsy of malignant material on the right pelvic peritoneum . The other two patients in this subset of 20 individuals had tumors that were uniformly negative for FR α expression , with 13 of 13 slides showing no evidence of staining . FR expression in primary versus recurrent disease To determine whether FR α expression changes after expo - sure to chemotherapy , we analyzed matched samples from the 24 patients in the sample set of 186 women who had multiple surgeries at Mayo Clinic . The median time between surgeries was 23 months ( range 6 – 83 months ) . Therefore , this subset of patients with recurrent disease included both individuals with longer disease - free periods , good performance status , and Table 3 Tumor morphologies of the samples used in the two subset analyses Primary and synchronous metastatic foci Histology FR α + , n ( % ) FR α − , n ( % ) Serous 12 ( 60 ) 0 Endometrioid 1 ( 5 ) 1 ( 5 ) Clear cell 3 ( 15 ) 0 Mucinous 1 ( 5 ) 1 ( 5 ) Mixed 1 ( 5 ) 0 Total 18 ( 90 ) 2 ( 10 ) Matched primary and recurrent disease Histology FR α status at diagnosis / recurrence , n ( % ) + / + − / − + / − − / + Serous 15 ( 62 . 5 ) 3 ( 12 . 5 ) 1 ( 4 . 2 ) 1 ( 4 . 2 ) Endometrioid 1 ( 4 . 2 ) 0 0 0 Clear cell 1 ( 4 . 2 ) 1 ( 4 . 2 ) 0 0 Mixed 0 0 0 1 ( 4 . 2 ) Total 17 ( 70 . 8 ) 4 ( 16 . 7 ) 1 ( 4 . 2 ) 2 ( 8 . 3 ) Fig . 2 .

Again , most samples expressed abundant FR α ( Fig . 2 ) , with 18 of 24 ( 75 % ) primary and 19 of 24 ( 79 . 2 % ) recurrent samples being positive . 17 patients ( 70 . 8 % ) had tumors that expressed FR α throughout the course of disease ( see Table 3 for tumor histology ) . Four patients ( 16 . 7 % ) had tumors that did not express FR α at either diagnosis or recur - rence . Interestingly , 2 patients who had tumors that were negative for FR α expression at diagnosis showed strong staining for FR α at recurrence , including one patient who had two subsequent debulking surgeries , both of which yielded tumors that were strongly positive . Only one patient with an initially FR α - positive tumor at diagnosis lost FR α expression at recurrence . Patient outcomes Disease recurrence was experienced by 117 patients ( 62 . 9 % ) , while 66 patients ( 35 . 5 % ) remain free of disease and 3 indi - viduals are lost to follow - up . Univariate analysis showed that advanced disease stage , serous morphology ( compared to all other morphologies combined ) , high - grade , and sub - optimal debulking were all associated with a higher risk of disease recurrence . FR α status was not associated with time to recur - rence as a univariate variable or after adjusting for disease stage , morphology , grade , and debulking status ( Table 4 ) . Similarly , when patients with fewer than 50 % of malignant cells positive for FR α expression were grouped with the FR α - negative sam - ples in order to assess the effect of the highest levels of FR α expression , no association could be found between FR α ex - pression and time to recurrence as a univariate variable or after adjusting as above ( data not shown ) . A similar analysis was performed for overall survival ( Table 4 ) . Again , advanced stage , serous morphology , high - grade , and sub - optimal debulking were all significantly associated with an increased risk of death as univariate variables . The improved prognosis conferred by having a tumor of non - serous morphology appears to be driven by the endometrioid tumors . When assessing only tumor mor - phology , serous tumors have significantly worse prognosis than Table 4 Effect of patient characteristics on time to disease recurrence and overall survival Time to recurrence Univariate Multivariable Hazard ratio ( 95 % CI ) p value Hazard ratio ( 95 % CI ) p value Advanced stage ( III – IV ) 6 . 84 ( 3 . 55 – 13 . 2 ) b 0 . 001 4 . 94 ( 2 . 49 – 9 . 81 ) b 0 . 001 High grade ( 3 – 4 ) 4 . 28 ( 1 . 87 – 9 . 77 ) b 0 . 001 2 . 17 ( 0 . 91 – 5 . 21 ) 0 . 082 Serous morphology 2 . 63 ( 1 . 76 – 3 . 93 ) b 0 . 001 1 . 48 ( 0 . 96 – 2 . 28 ) 0 . 079 Sub - optimal debulking 2 . 48 ( 1 . 50 – 4 . 10 ) b 0 . 001 1 . 63 ( 0 . 97 – 2 . 73 ) 0 . 064 FR α + 1 . 21 ( 0 . 79 – 1 . 84 ) 0 . 38 0 . 90 ( 0 . 58 – 1 . 39 ) 0 . 63 Time to death Univariate Multivariable Hazard ratio ( 95 % CI ) p value Hazard ratio ( 95 % CI ) p value Advanced stage ( III – IV ) 2 . 96 ( 1 . 79 – 4 . 90 ) b 0 . 001 2 . 26 ( 1 . 31 – 3 . 90 ) 0 . 003 High grade ( 3 – 4 ) 3 . 42 ( 1 . 59 – 7 . 35 ) 0 . 002 2 . 77 ( 1 . 24 – 6 . 19 ) 0 . 013 Serous morphology 1 . 74 ( 1 . 20 – 2 . 52 ) 0 . 004 1 . 01 ( 0 . 67 – 1 . 53 ) 0 . 96 Sub - optimal debulking 2 . 52 ( 1 . 56 – 4 . 08 ) b 0 . 001 2 . 13 ( 1 . 29 – 3 . 50 ) 0 . 003 FR α + 1 . 02 ( 0 . 68 – 1 . 52 ) 0 . 92 0 . 86 ( 0 . 57 – 1 . 31 ) 0 . 49 Fig . 3 .

This is consistent with the effect of serous versus endometrioid tumor morphology on outcome in a study of stage III patients [ 20 ] . However , this is not maintained after adjusting for stage , grade , FR α expression , and debulking status [ HR 1 . 23 ( 95 % CI 0 . 70 , 2 . 15 ) , p = 0 . 47 ] . FR α status did not impact survival as a univariate variable or in multivariable analyses . Kaplan – Meier plots showed no statistically significant differences based on FR α status , although there was a modest trend towards earlier recurrence with FR α - positive tumors that was not reflected in the survival data ( Fig . 3 ) . Discussion We analyzed FR α expression in a cohort of women with ovarian cancer who were treated at our institution with rigorous surgical debulking followed by chemotherapy when indicated by their disease stage and debulking status . We examined the extent of FR α expression in 186 primary and 27 recurrent ovarian cancers , including matched samples from 24 patients who had primary and secondary debulking surgeries at our institution . In addition , we examined primary disease and con - comitant metastatic disease in a subset of 20 patients . We show that 134 of 186 ( 72 % ) primary tumors and 22 of 27 ( 81 . 5 % ) recurrent tumors were positive for FR α expression , that syn - chronous metastatic disease has similar characteristics to the primary tumor , and that FR α expression is commonly main - tained in recurrent disease . These observations support the use of FR α - targeted strategies in most women with both newly diagnosed and recurrent ovarian cancer . The data also suggest that immunohistochemical analysis of FR status at initial biopsy can guide the decision whether to use an FR α - targeted therapy upon recurrence . We also analyzed whether FR α expression was associated with outcome . While FR α staining was more prevalent in women with aggressive disease ( high - grade , serous morphol - ogy ) , we did not detect an association between FR α expression and overall survival . This is similar to the findings of Toffoli et al . , who analyzed the survival of 99 ovarian cancer patients who had been treated with a platinum agent between 1990 and 1995 [ 11 ] . Given the common expression of FR α on aggres - sive ovarian cancers ( i . e . only 20 high - stage , high - grade serous tumors lacked FR α expression in this study ) , very large sample sizes will be required to accrue sufficient numbers of patients with FR α - negative tumors for statistically meaningful com - parisons . This makes analysis of the impact of FR α expression in ovarian cancer rather more difficult than in breast and uterine cancers ; in these diseases , with strong FR α expression in a smaller proportion of patients , FR α expression is a negative prognostic factor [ 21 , 22 ] . The Toffoli study concluded that high FR α expression was a predictor of cisplatin resistance in a subset of 58 women with N 2 cm residual disease after surgery . Our analysis showed no interaction of FR α staining and debulking status . Moreover , we saw no relationship between FR α expression and time to dis - ease recurrence , a commonly accepted surrogate for responsive - ness to initial chemotherapy [ 12 , 17 , 16 ] . While the function of FR α in cancers is not fully understood , folates are critical metabolites for nucleotide synthesis and meth - ylation reactions , so it is logical to propose that rapidly dividing cells may realize a growth advantage when this folate transporter is upregulated . Several lines of evidence support this idea . Spe - cifically , overexpression of FR α in osteosarcoma [ 23 ] or NIH / 3T3 [ 24 ] cells allows increased growth in folate - limited medium and formation of larger NIH / 3T3 tumors in vivo [ 25 ] . Down - regulating FR α using antisense strategies decreased the prolif - eration rate of breast cancer cell lines and increased their sensi - tivity to doxorubicin [ 26 ] , and intracellular anti - FR α antibodies reduced the ability of ovarian cancer cell lines to proliferate and to grow in soft agar [ 27 ] . In human disease , it is plausible that the tumor microenvironment creates local folate - deficient areas in which FR α - positive cells could have a growth advantage . Regardless of the physiological role for FR α in malignant tumors , its tumor - specific overexpression and ability to interna - lize folate - conjugates suggest that the majority of women with epithelial ovarian cancer may benefit from strategies targeting FR α . These strategies include use of anti - FR α antibodies [ 10 ] or folic acid - conjugates to localize drugs [ 28 – 30 ] , imaging com - pounds [ 31 – 33 ] , Tcells [ 34 , 35 ] , nanoparticles [ 36 ] , or oncolytic viruses [ 37 ] to FR α - expressing tumors . Besides these efforts , we have recently shown that FR α may have potential as a target for immunotherapeutic approaches in ovarian cancer . FR α is a tumor - associated antigen that induces detectable immune re - sponses in 70 % of patients with breast and ovarian cancer [ 9 ] . The presence of endogenous immune reactivity raises the pos - sibility that the immune response could be further enhanced by vaccines targeting the FR α . Other groups have reported using PCR or radioligand bind - ing assays to analyze FR α expression in ovarian cancer cell lines [ 38 , 39 ] or small numbers of ovarian tumor specimens [ 40 , 41 , 8 ] . The strengths of our study include the use of a large cohort of 186 patients with newly diagnosed , previously un - treated ovarian cancer . Unlike a previous report addressing the association of FR α expression and outcome [ 11 ] , the majority of these patients received optimal debulking surgery and com - bination chemotherapy that included a taxane . Another strength is the extensive follow - up available and complete clinical an - notation of these specimens due to the retrospective nature of the study . We utilized formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded tis - sues archived through the Mayo Clinic Tissue Registry , which has systematically preserved surgical specimens since the early 1900s . Immunohistochemistry was chosen because it is efficient for large numbers of samples ( especially when tissue micro - arrays are utilized ) , allows examination of malignant epithelial cells without microdissection , and avoids specificity concerns in radioligand binding assays such as non - malignant cells ( for example , activated macrophages that would also bind radio - labeled folic acid ) contributing to the signal . Nevertheless , studies assessing FR α expression by other methodologies such as direct protein measurement , including quantitative detection of shed FR α in serum , may have different results . A limitation to the study is that FR α expression occurs frequently , espe - cially in the common high - grade , high - stage serous tumors that are most likely to recur . In addition , because the less common 624 K . R . Kalli et al . / Gynecologic Oncology 108 ( 2008 ) 619 – 626 morphologies that ultimately showed less FR α expression were oversampled , this retrospective study cannot be used to estab - lish the prevalence of FR α + tumors in ovarian cancer patients ; in other words , our observed proportion of FR α - positive tu - mors of 72 % is likely an underestimate of true prevalence . Prospective studies of FR α expression and its association with outcome would be required to confirm these results . It is clear , however , that the small number of ovarian cancer patients with tumors that do not express this tumor marker makes it difficult to assess FR α expression as an independent factor potentially influencing outcome . In summary , the common expression of FR α on primary and synchronous metastatic disease as well as on recurrent disease suggests that FR α - based therapeutic strategies may be helpful for most women with ovarian cancer , whether newly diagnosed with disseminated disease or experiencing disease recurrence . A number of strategies to take advantage of this observation are being pursued , with several folate - targeted drugs currently un - dergoing testing in clinical trials .
