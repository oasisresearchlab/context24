J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 1 Risk factors , presentation , and course of COVID - 19 in a large , academic long - term care 1 facility 2 3 Abstract 4 Objective : To describe clinical characteristics , and risk factors associated with COVID - 19 in 5 long - stay nursing home residents . 6 Design and Participants : Retrospective cohort study ( 3 / 16 / 2020 - 5 / 8 / 2020 ) . 7 Setting : Academic long - term chronic care facility ( Boston , MA ) 8 Participants : Long - term care residents 9 Methods : Patient characteristics and clinical symptoms were obtained via electronic medical 10 records and Minimum Data Set . Staff residence was inferred by zip codes . COVID - 19 infection 11 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing using nasopharyngeal swabs . Residents 12 were followed until discharge from facility , death , or up to 21 days . Risk of COVID - 19 infection 13 were modeled by generalized estimating equation to estimate the relative risk and 95 % 14 confidence intervals of patient characteristics and staff community of residence . 15 Results : Overall 146 of 389 ( 37 . 5 % ) long - stay residents tested positive for COVID - 19 . At the 16 time of positive test , 66 of 146 ( 45 . 5 % ) residents were asymptomatic . In the subsequent illness 17 course the most common symptom was anorexia ( 70 . 8 % ) , followed by delirium ( 57 . 6 % ) . During 18 follow - up 44 ( 30 . 1 % ) of residents with COVID - 19 died . Mortality increased with frailty ( 16 . 7 % 19 in pre - frail , 22 . 2 % in moderately frail , and 50 . 0 % in frail ; p < 0 . 001 ) . The proportion of residents 20 infected with COVID - 19 varied across the long - term care units ( range : 0 - 90 . 5 % ) . In adjusted 21 models male sex ( RR : 1 . 80 , 95 % CI , 1 . 07 , 3 . 05 ) , bowel incontinence ( RR : 1 . 97 , 95 % CI 1 . 10 , 22 3 . 52 ) , and staff residence remained significant predictors of COVID - 19 . For every 10 % increase 23 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2 in the proportion of staff living in a high prevalence community , the risk of testing positive 24 increased by 6 % ( 95 % CI , 1 . 04 , 1 . 08 ) . 25 Conclusions and Implications : Among long - term care residents diagnosed with COVID - 19 , 26 nearly half were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis . Predictors of COVID - 19 infection 27 included male sex , bowel incontinence and staff residence in a community with a high burden of 28 COVID - 19 . Universal testing of patients and staff in communities with high COVID - 19 rates is 29 essential to mitigating outbreaks . 30 31 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 Introduction 32 The COVID - 19 pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus ( SARS - Cov - 2 ) has had a marked 33 impact on every sector of society , with long - term care facilities and nursing homes bearing a 34 disproportionate amount of disease burden and mortality . 1 , 2 In 2019 1 . 4 million persons , or 35 approximately 3 % of the United States’ population aged 65 years or older , resided in long - term 36 care facilities . Presently in the United States forty percent of all COVID - 19 related deaths have 37 occurred among nursing home residents , 3 with at least six states reporting more than half of 38 deaths are in these facilities . 4 The World Health Organization reported a similar proportion of 39 fatalities in Europe from long - term care facilities . 5 Thus understanding the presenting clinical 40 symptoms , clinical course , and predictors of COVID - 19 within long term care facilities is 41 paramount to crafting an informed societal response to this pandemic . 42 43 Limited information exists on the presenting characteristics and clinical course of COVID - 19 in 44 long - term care residents . 6 Epidemiologic studies suggest that many persons infected with 45 COVID - 19 do not develop symptoms : among 200 randomly selected community dwellers , 30 % 46 had evidence of antibodies to COVID - 19 despite reporting no symptoms . 7 Aging can affect 47 common disease presentations , and older adults often present with atypical symptoms . 48 Additional challenges are posed when long - term care residents with advanced dementia have an 49 impaired ability to communicate their symptoms . A better understanding of the presenting 50 symptoms and clinical course of COVID - 19 in this vulnerable population may hasten diagnosis , 51 which is critical to prevent the rapid , unintended spread of disease in this setting . 52 53 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 Factors related to transmission of COVID - 19 within long - term care facilities are also not well 54 understood . Media attention has suggested that COVID - 19 transmission in NHs may be related 55 to poor quality of care , 8 but patient and staff characteristics are likely to affect disease burden . 56 For example , behavioral symptoms of dementia , such as wandering , could increase the risk of 57 transmission . Also , residents with advanced dementia typically require assistance with toileting 58 and feeding , demanding close personal contact with direct care staff . Staff who live in a 59 neighborhood more severely affected by COVID - 19 may then inadvertently increase the risk of 60 transmission among these residents . 61 62 The objective of this study was to describe the presenting clinical characteristics and outcomes of 63 long - term care residents affected by COVID - 19 in a large , academic long - term care facility . 64 Further , we described variation in the prevalence of COVID - 19 infection across units , and we 65 identified patient and staff characteristics associated with COVID - 19 infection . We 66 hypothesized that patient characteristics , such as wandering , and staff residence ( i . e . , living in a 67 community with a high burden of COVID - 19 ) , would be associated with testing positive for 68 COVID - 19 . 69 70 Methods 71 Study Population : This study was conducted in an approximately 500 bed academic long - term 72 care facility in the Boston area . During the study period , there were eight long - term care units , 73 licensed as a long - term chronic care hospital ( LTCH ) . In addition , the facility housed one 74 medically complex acute care unit , and a sub - acute rehabilitation unit which are excluded from 75 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 this study . A no - visitor policy took place on March 12 , 2020 , with screening of staff symptoms 76 upon facility entry . Staff were instructed to wear masks beginning March 25 , 2020 . This study 77 was approved by the Institutional Review Board at [ removed for double - blind review ] . Neither 78 patients nor the public were involved in the design , or conduct , or reporting , or dissemination 79 plans of our research . 80 81 All consecutive patients in the facility tested for COVID - 19 between March 16 , 2020 and May 8 , 82 2020 were included in the study . Between March 16 , 2020 and April 10 , 2020 COVID - 19 tests 83 were ordered based on clinical suspicion of the disease or exposure to a confirmed case . Between 84 April 11 , 2020 and April 17 , 2020 , universal testing was implemented and every resident in the 85 facility was tested for COVID - 19 . Patients who tested negative were re - tested based on clinical 86 suspicion of the disease or known exposure to confirmed cases . We excluded residents with a 87 positive COVID - 19 test prior to admission to the facility ( n = 16 ) , patients on the sub - acute 88 rehabilitation unit ( n = 32 ) , and patients in the medically complex acute care unit ( n = 17 ) . 89 90 COVID - 19 testing : Data on the name , dates , and test results of patients receiving the polymerase 91 chain reaction test for COVID - 19 was prospectively collected in a facility log . Testing was 92 obtained by clinical staff within the facility using nasopharyngeal swabs and processed at an 93 affiliated hospital with most results available within 24 hours . 94 95 Clinical Presentation : Using the facility’s electronic medical records ( EMR ) , we reviewed 96 nursing , nutrition , and medical provider notes to identify clinical symptoms on the calendar day 97 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 the first positive test was ordered and the three preceding days , including of cough , anorexia , 98 vomiting , or diarrhea . Delirium , either documented by a geriatrician or reported as an acute 99 change in mental status or lethargy , was noted . Fever , defined as any recorded temperature of 100 greater than or equal to 100 o Fahrenheit , was documented from the vital sign reports . 101 102 We obtained information on clinical symptoms and outcomes following a positive test , including 103 vomiting , diarrhea , delirium , and anorexia . The total number of calendar days with fever , the 104 need for supplemental oxygen , hospitalization , and falls ( during the three days before testing or 105 any time during follow - up ) were recorded . Symptoms were evaluated until death , or until 21 106 calendar days following the first positive test or end of study follow - up ( May 8 , 2020 ) . 107 108 Resident Characteristics : We collected information on resident characteristics including 109 demographics such as age , sex , and race using the MDS assessment between December 2019 and 110 February 2020 . The MDS is a federally mandated clinical assessment completed on all nursing 111 home residents at the time of admission and quarterly thereafter . 9 Information on clinical 112 characteristics including cognitive function , as measured by the validated Cognitive Performance 113 Scale ( CPS ) , 10 functional characteristics , body mass index ( BMI ) , and behavioral symptoms , 114 were also obtained . A Frailty index ( range 0 - 1 , 1 indicates more severe frailty ) was calculated 115 using 35 items from the MDS , using a standard deficit accumulation approach . 11 Variables used 116 in construction of the frailty index include comorbidities , functional activities of daily living , 117 sensory impairment , weight loss and cognition . 118 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 Staff Community of Residence : Staff typically provide care on a single unit , and rarely float 119 between units . We obtained a list of the home zip codes for all nurses and personal care 120 assistants . Zip codes were used to determine the rate of COVID - 19 infection in each staff 121 member’s community of residence . Rates of infection were obtained from publicly available 122 websites through May 7 , 2020 . 12 - 14 A community was considered to have a high infection rate if 123 the rate was in the top decile of COVID - 19 rates for the state of Massachusetts ( ≥ 1 , 277 124 cases / 100 , 000 persons ) . Staff members represent a total of 368 persons with 91 distinct zip 125 codes . The aggregated distribution and range of COVID - 19 cases in the state and community 126 where staff members live is listed in Appendix 1 . 127 128 Statistical Analysis : We described resident characteristics overall , and according to COVID - 19 129 testing results , comparing with Chi - 2 or t - tests for categorical and continuous variables , 130 respectively Among patients who tested positive , we described clinical characteristics at 131 presentation and clinical outcomes , including all - cause mortality . The clinical characteristic 132 results were stratified by frailty status , categorized by calculated frailty index 11 : Pre - frail ( < 0 . 25 ) , 133 mildly frail ( 0 . 25 - 0 . 34 ) , or moderate - severely frail ( ≥ 0 . 35 ) . A statistical comparison of clinical 134 characteristics as categorical variables was done using a Chi - square test . In a sensitivity analysis , 135 we excluded residents who were diagnosed near the end of the study period and without the 136 opportunity for 21 days of follow - up . 137 138 The proportion of residents testing positive for COVID - 19 virus was calculated on each of the 139 eight , LTC units . Demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients on each unit was 140 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 aggregated , regardless of COVID - 19 status . We classified units as having a high burden of 141 COVID - 19 disease if > 50 % of residents were affected , a moderate burden if 5 - 50 % of residents 142 were affected , and a low burden if < 5 % of residents were affected by disease . Comparison of 143 resident characteristics and staff residence by unit were done using a one - way analysis of 144 variance ANOVA . As a sensitivity analysis , we repeated our analyses including only those who 145 died or had 21 days of follow up ( Appendix 2 ) . 146 147 Finally , we developed a regression model of COVID - 19 infection using the modified Poisson 148 concept 15 , with estimation of relative risks and associated 95 % confidence intervals by 149 generalized estimating equations ( GEE ) using a log link function . Both patient characteristics 150 and aggregated staff residence data were used to model outcome of a positive COVID - 19 test . 151 Characteristics were entered into bivariate models , and those that were significant at the p ≤ 0 . 10 152 level were entered into the final model . Analyses were performed using Stata version 16 . 0 153 ( StataCorp LLC , College Station , TX ) and SAS version 9 . 4 ( SAS Institute Inc . , Cary , NC ) . 154 Results 155 During the study period , 389 residents received 620 tests for COVID - 19 ( mean 1 . 6 , range 1 - 6 156 tests ) . The mean ( Standard Deviation ; SD ) age of the study population was 86 . 8 ( 9 . 0 ) years . 253 157 ( 65 . 7 % ) residents were female , and 37 ( 9 . 6 % ) identified as having non - white race . 146 residents 158 ( 37 . 5 % ) had one or more positive tests for COVID - 19 . Characteristics of residents are listed in 159 Table 1 , according to COVID - 19 test results . Residents who tested positive for COVID - 19 were 160 younger ( 85 . 0 years versus 87 . 9 years ) and more likely to be male and non - white . Residents who 161 tested positive for COVID - 19 were also more likely to have severe cognitive and functional 162 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 impairment , and behavioral symptoms , as compared with residents who tested negative for 163 disease . 164 165 At the time of the positive test , 35 ( 24 . 1 % ) of residents had cough , 31 ( 21 . 4 % ) residents had a 166 fever , 26 ( 17 . 9 % ) residents had vomiting , 9 ( 6 . 2 % ) residents had diarrhea , and 26 ( 17 . 9 % ) had 167 anorexia ( Table 2 ) . Other symptoms that were reported in less than 5 % of residents included red 168 eyes , abdominal pain , sore throat , tachycardia , shortness of breath , or unsteady gait . Delirium 169 was documented in 18 . 6 % of residents at the time of the positive test . Sixty - six residents ( 45 . 5 % ) 170 were asymptomatic at the time of the positive test . Clinical symptoms at the time of presentation 171 were similar according to frailty status with the exception that fever was more common in 172 residents with mild ( 28 . 9 % ) or moderate to severe frailty ( 26 . 9 % ) as opposed to pre - frail 173 residents ( 4 . 9 % , p = 0 . 01 ) . 174 175 The most common clinical symptoms reported during follow up were anorexia ( 71 . 0 % ) and 176 delirium ( 57 . 9 % ) . Fifty - eight residents ( 40 . 0 % ) developed an oxygen requirement , and 22 177 residents ( 15 . 1 % ) experienced a fall during the three days before diagnosis or during follow - up . 178 The mean number of days of fever was 1 . 8 ( range 0 - 9 ) . Nine residents ( 6 . 5 % ) were hospitalized . 179 Twenty - one ( 15 . 0 % ) residents remained asymptomatic during follow up , and an additional 8 . 8 % 180 residents had no symptom except anorexia during follow - up . During a median follow up time of 181 21 days , 44 ( 30 . 1 % ) of residents with COVID - 19 disease died . The proportion of residents who 182 died from COVID - 19 increased as frailty severity increased ( 16 . 7 % in pre - frail , 22 . 2 % in 183 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 moderately frail , and 50 . 0 % in frail ; p < 0 . 001 ) . Results were similar when we restricted our 184 analysis to residents with the opportunity for 21 days of follow - up ( Appendix 2 ) . 185 186 The proportion of residents infected with COVID - 19 varied across the long - term care units 187 ( range : 0 - 90 . 5 % , Table 3 ) Units with a high burden of disease had more residents of younger 188 age , severe cognitive impairment , and behavioral symptoms . Units with a high burden of disease 189 were more likely to have staff members that lived in a community with a high rate of COVID - 19 190 infection . 191 192 In unadjusted models , eight resident characteristics were significant predictors of COVID - 19 193 disease including younger age and wandering ( Table 4 ) . The proportion of staff living in a 194 community with a high rate of COVID - 19 was also a significant predictor of testing positive 195 ( RR : 1 . 06 , 95 % CI 1 . 05 , 1 . 08 ) . In the adjusted model , two clinical characteristics were associated 196 with an increased risk of testing positive for COVID - 19 : male sex ( RR : 1 . 80 , 95 % CI , 1 . 07 , 3 . 05 ) 197 and bowel incontinence ( RR : 1 . 97 , 95 % CI 1 . 10 , 3 . 52 ) . Staff residence was a significant 198 predictor of disease : for every 10 % increase in the number of staff who live in a high prevalence 199 community , the risk of testing positive for COVID - 19 increased by 6 % ( 95 % CI , 1 . 04 , 1 . 08 ) . 200 201 202 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 Discussion : 203 This retrospective cohort study of a large , long - term care facility underscores the devastating 204 effect this virus may have in long - term care facilities and nursing homes . More than forty 205 percent of long - term care residents who were COVID - 19 positive were asymptomatic at the time 206 of testing and many never developed any symptoms . Among those presenting with symptoms , 207 cough , fever , and delirium were most common , and 44 ( 30 . 1 % ) residents died . Across the long - 208 term care units , there was considerable variation in the burden of infected residents . Predictors 209 of testing positive for COVID - 19 included male sex , bowel incontinence and a greater proportion 210 of staff members living in a community with a high rate of COVID - 19 infection . 211 212 Our results demonstrate that even in a frail , long - term care population , the prevalence of 213 asymptomatic carriers of COVID - 19 is substantial ( 45 . 5 % ) . In a study of 89 nursing home 214 residents in Washington State , 56 % of residents who tested positive for COVID - 19 were 215 asymptomatic at diagnosis , but only 3 / 27 residents ( 11 . 1 % ) remained asymptomatic one week 216 after diagnosis using a prospective symptom survey . 6 We found a slightly greater proportion of 217 residents remained asymptomatic over 3 weeks : 15 . 0 % were asymptomatic and an additional 218 8 . 8 % experienced only transient anorexia . Without universal testing , asymptomatic residents 219 would go undiagnosed and may continue to spread the disease . It is challenging to prevent 220 spread of the virus in LTC given the high prevalence of moderate to severe cognitive 221 impairment . Often , these patients are unable to adhere to infection control guidelines ( e . g . 222 frequent handwashing , mask wearing ) , or safely isolate themselves . Ideally , residents with 223 behavioral symptoms and COVID - 19 should be managed in a designated unit . 224 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 Among symptomatic patients , delirium was one of the most common presenting clinical 225 symptoms of COVID - 19 infection . Atypical presentations of other infectious diseases , such as 226 delirium with urinary tract infections , have been well described in frail , older adults and LTC 227 residents . Case reports of atypical presentations of COVID - 19 include delirium as a presenting 228 symptom , 16 - 18 and a high prevalence of delirium has been reported among COVID - 19 patients in 229 Intensive Care Units . 19 A case - series of hospitalized patients from Wuhan , China with COVID - 230 19 infection reported 7 . 5 % experienced impaired consciousness or delirium . 20 In the Washington 231 nursing home study , 25 % 21 of residents had altered mental status at the time of diagnosis . 6 232 Although we found a higher overall prevalence of delirium in our study ( 55 . 9 % at any time 233 during illness ) , we suspect delirium was underreported . We also found that falls were prevalent . 234 Increased surveillance of delirium and falls in the NH using standardized tools may be beneficial 235 to clinicians , administrators , and policy makers interested in the mitigating morbidity of COVID - 236 19 within a facility . 237 238 Previous reports suggest that COVID - 19 transmission in nursing homes may be associated with 239 poor quality of care 8 or shortages of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) . Our facility 240 implemented the same infection control procedures across all long - term care units , yet we found 241 that the prevalence of COVID - 19 disease varied widely . Predictors of testing positive for 242 COVID - 19 included male sex and bowel incontinence . There have been a number of theories 243 proposed for why men are more vulnerable , including androgen promotion of TPRSS2 , a serine 244 protease that promotes SARS - CoV2 penetration into host cells , 22 X - linked genetic differences 23 , 245 or differences in the innate and adaptive immune function between men and women . 23 Direct 246 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 care staff must have close , prolonged contact to assist patients with bowel incontinence , which 247 may place these residents at greatest risk . 248 249 The community where staff lived was also a significant predictor of disease . A recent study of 250 surveillance testing among more than 15 , 000 staff members from Assisted Living Facilities and 251 SNFs found that 92 . 4 % of staff who test positive for COVID - 19 were asymptomatic at the time 252 of testing . 24 Thus , staff members who reside in a community with a high burden of COVID - 19 253 may inadvertently expose nursing home residents . Two recent studies are consistent with our 254 findings : the strongest factors associated with COVID - 19 outbreaks in nursing home facilities 255 was larger facility size and geography . 25 , 26 To put our findings in context , in a facility with 50 256 direct care staff , for every 5 staff members who live in a community with a high burden of 257 COVID - 19 , each resident’s risk of contracting COVID - 19 increases by 6 % . Rates of COVID - 19 258 in the communities where staff resided reflect a broad prevalence comparable to Massachusetts 259 state data ( Appendix 1 ) , and it is unlikely that single zip code outliers were responsible for our 260 results . Together , these findings suggest that community prevalence of COVID - 19 remains a 261 major risk factor for nursing home outbreaks , and thus efforts directed toward mitigating 262 outbreaks in nursing homes must additionally consider the broader community which they 263 belong to . 264 265 There are weaknesses of our study . First , data on clinical characteristics was collected from 266 retrospective chart review , and we suspect underreporting of some symptoms . Second , we did 267 not have comprehensive staff testing during the study dates to directly determine COVID - 19 268 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 status . We chose to collect zip code information on nurses and personal care attendants as the 269 largest group of employees with direct patient contact . It is possible that some staff members 270 had exposures apart from their local communities . Third , during the beginning of our study 271 period , nurses and care attendants rarely worked on multiple units ; however , during the later 272 weeks of the study , staff illness necessitated some movement between units . This was kept to a 273 minimum , and as most of our cases took place in the earlier half of the study it was less likely to 274 influence results . Fourth , our model to predict COVID - 19 disease aggregated staff exposure at 275 the level of the unit . The third and fourth limitation may result in some misclassification of staff 276 residence . This should bias our results to the null , so the true association between staff residence 277 and COVID - 19 infection may be higher . Finally , our results are from a single , academic facility . 278 Our patient population is older and has a greater burden of comorbidities than most community 279 nursing homes . The overall census of our facility is equivalent to several nursing homes . 280 Although resident characteristics differ across units , staffing is independent on each unit and 281 infection control and admission policies are standardized across all units . Thus , our finding of 282 differential infection prevalence across units strongly suggests that other nursing home residents 283 who require a high level of care and live in a community with a high burden of COVID - 19 are 284 vulnerable . 285 286 Conclusions and Implications 287 First , given the large number of asymptomatic carriers , universal testing of long - term care 288 residents is strongly recommended . Second , standardized quick assessments for delirium may be 289 useful in identifying early cases of COVID - 19 . Third , special attention should be given to 290 residents with bowel incontinence , as the close , direct contact required to care for these residents 291 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 may confer particularly high risk for the virus . Finally , because the community where staff live 292 was a significant predictor of COVID - 19 disease , early testing of direct patient care staff is 293 recommended . As part of early response to the pandemic some cities and health systems offered 294 alternative housing for health care workers . Allowing nursing home care workers to take 295 advantage of such opportunities may be a strategy to reduce community exposure and potential 296 introduction into the facility . Lastly , many states are now recommending universal testing of all 297 nursing home workers , who provide direct patient care . Facilities with limited resources could 298 consider prioritizing testing for staff in neighborhoods where COVID - 19 is most prevalent . 299 300 In summary , despite the abundant precautionary measures initiated in a well - resourced LTC 301 facility , COVID - 19 disease was prevalent in many of the LTC units . More than 40 % of infected 302 residents were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis , and many never developed symptoms . 303 Male sex , bowel incontinence , and the community where staff lived were predictors of COVID - 304 19 infection . Improved strategies to detect and mitigate spread of COVID - 19 within long - term 305 care facilities are urgently needed . We hope that our findings and implications will be 306 informative as these strategies are being developed . 307 308 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 16 Table 1 .
