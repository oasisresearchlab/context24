Six Feet Apart : Online Payments During the COVID - 19 Pandemic OMAR SHAIKH ∗ , Georgia Institute of Technology , USA CASSANDRA UNG , Block , Inc , USA DIYI YANG , Georgia Institute of Technology , USA FELIPE CHACON , Block , Inc , USA Since the COVID - 19 pandemic , businesses have faced unprecedented challenges when trying to remain open . Because COVID - 19 spreads through aerosolized droplets , businesses were forced to distance their services ; in some cases , distancing may have involved moving business services online . In this work , we explore digitization strategies used by small businesses that remained open during the pandemic , and survey / interview small businesses owners to understand preliminary challenges associated with moving online . Furthermore , we analyze payments from 400K businesses across Japan , Australia , United States , Great Britain , and Canada . Following initial government interventions , we observe ( at minimum for each country ) a 47 % increase in digitizing businesses compared to pre - pandemic levels , with about 80 % of surveyed businesses digitizing in under a week . From both our quantitative models and our surveys / interviews , we find that businesses rapidly digitized at the start of the pandemic in preparation of future uncertainty . We also conduct a case - study of initial digitization in the United States , examining finer relationships between specific government interventions , business sectors , political orientation , and resulting digitization shifts . Finally , we discuss the implications of rapid & widespread digitization for small businesses in the context of usability challenges and interpersonal interactions , while highlighting potential shifts in pre - existing social norms .

We needed to keep our talent on payroll but also needed to close due to the risk of COVID . We had to figure something out , fast . ” - P2 As COVID - 19 infections initially spread around the world , from early to mid 2020 , small busi - nesses were forced to re - evaluate how to transact in a rapidly changing environment [ 2 ] . With multiple regions around the world enforcing business - related restrictions [ 34 ] , sellers were faced with unprecedented challenges when adjusting their business models to continue taking payments . ∗ Work completed during an internship at Block .

H C ] 29 A p r 2022 CSCW ’22 , Virtual Shaikh et al . Furthermore , both COVID - 19 infection rates and restrictions varied substantially across regions : Australia enforced strong travel bans and mandatory stay - at - home restrictions despite relatively low COVID - 19 rates , while some regions in the United States enforced little to no restrictions in spite of soaring COVID - 19 rates . Variations in COVID - 19 rates , along with corresponding policy , likely determined if businesses could remain open . Online stores offer a potential alternative to businesses affected by COVID - 19 . By offering ser - vices and goods online , businesses can avoid the physical limitations associated with COVID - 19 transmission . Analogous works on understanding and augmenting physical experiences with digiti - zation ( in response to the pandemic ) are far - ranging , looking at education [ 13 , 44 , 71 ] , independent musicians , theatres [ 9 ] , and cattle markets [ 55 ] . These works highlight both benefits and challenges associated with moving activities online . Small businesses , however , are especially unique , since they already face challenges with digitization . For example , older customers may be apprehensive of foreign digital payment methods [ 89 ] deployed at these businesses . Furthermore , specific service sectors may have difficulty finding appropriate ways to digitize their services . With the COVID - 19 pandemic , some businesses may have been forced to digitize despite usability concerns . Small busi - nesses must also independently deploy and solve issues with their digital payment infrastructure , unlike significantly larger online shopping services . Understanding the degree to which different business sectors were affected by the pandemic will help quantify the digitization shift , and may provide insight into better serving future concerns ( beyond COVID - 19 ) raised by the necessity to move online . The adoption of digital payment techniques may also vary based on region - dependent factors . Prior work shows that , although government interventions are effective at minimizing the trans - mission of COVID - 19 , adherence to these interventions depends on pre - existing social factors [ 86 ] . For example , region and political orientation may both affect adherence to social - distancing orders [ 6 , 29 ] , further influencing the adoption of digitization . Because inter - and intranational responses to COVID - 19 vary significantly , understanding what factors correlate with different increases in digitization also sheds light on the effect of government interventions in the context of small business . Finally , many regions were simply unprepared for COVID - 19 , having little infrastructure in place to handle interventions for slowing transmission [ 77 ] . Motivated by these concerns , our work aims to understand the effects of the COVID - 19 pandemic on business digitization , via three research questions . We start with a comprehensive analysis of the preliminary reasons behind small business’ moving online via qualitative studies . Specifically , we examine if policy interventions and / or COVID - 19 caused a digitization shift , while documenting early challenges from businesses . RQ1 : How has the pandemic caused small businesses to digitize , and do they face any preliminary usability challenges with digitization ? After establishing causes and challenges associated with small business digitization , we then quantify and compare digitization internationally via quantitative methods . Prior international cultural differences associated with adopting technological infrastructure [ 47 ] may reflect on COVID - 19 digitization and its associated challenges . Therefore , to understand digitization at an international scale , we focus on when businesses digitized with respect to COVID - 19 surges , and quantify differences in digitization across several countries . RQ2 : Have COVID - 19 rates predicted digitization shifts through a large duration ( 11 / 2019 - 7 / 2021 ) of the pandemic ? If so , do these changes differ at an international level ? To obtain finer grained relationships affecting digitization , our RQ3 builds on RQ2 by taking a closer look at the effect of specific state - level factors ( e . g . policy ) and business sectors on digitization , 2 Online Payments During the COVID - 19 Pandemic CSCW ’22 , Virtual during the initial COVID - 19 surge ( March 2020 ) . Specifically , we will dive deeper into a case - study of the United States , where a majority of our survey sample resides . RQ3 : How have different intranational government interventions and regional factors in the United States affected initial digitization for distinct small business sectors ? Overall , understanding how businesses adopted digital infrastructure in response to the pandemic may help identify challenges associated with moving online . Furthermore , characterizing and quantifying the scale of digitization during the COVID - 19 pandemic will highlight the potential impact of improving technological infrastructure to support small businesses . Broadly , our work highlights the following implications for the design and adoption of online payment systems : ( 1 ) Almost all studied regions have seen a significant and rapid increase in the initial adoption of digital payment techniques following interventions . Businesses cited proactiveness , with respect to changing interventions , as a reason behind early adoption . The magnitude of adoption also correlates with interventions and pre - existing social factors . ( 2 ) Rapid digitization can alienate both businesses and customers . Hybrid digitization strategies ( e . g . appointments , gift cards ) —that combine an in - person and online experience—are a potential solution for various business sectors and customer demographics . ( 3 ) Businesses , especially in service oriented sectors , strongly value interpersonal interactions with customers . Hybrid payment interactions have also allowed businesses to stay in touch with customers , while offering a personalized experience . Despite significant early adoption , businesses are still experimenting with strategies that promote interpersonal interactions . 2 BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK 2 . 1 Trends in Payment Digitization Although monetary interactions originate from the exchange of physical tokens , transactions are becoming increasingly digital . The advent of online banking , mobile wallets , and eCommerce technologies have catalyzed a transition from transactions that relied largely on cash towards increasingly digital exchanges [ 51 , 70 ] . These technologies are enabling users to interact with their personal finances in novel ways . By moving to a digitally grounded payment system , users can easily analyze prior payment history , recover / record transactions [ 64 ] , and send money to other individuals almost instantaneously [ 90 ] . Furthermore , the advent of digitized wallets allows users to decouple themselves from large financial institutions ( i . e . , “unbanking” ) , and rely on digital wallets ( like Venmo and Cash App ) to store their income [ 67 ] . Digital payment wallets , for example , are increasing in popularity around the world . Mobile payment systems like M - Pesa are already acting as a bank for some individuals [ 49 ] . Some mobile payment wallets , like Venmo and Cash App , are also issuing physical cards that allow users to directly utilize their balances in a mobile wallet , further incentivizing a transition away from traditional banking systems [ 80 , 88 ] . Although research in understanding the adoption speed of digital payment systems remains somewhat limited , work on the active utilization of payment technologies—like QR codes [ 52 ] , NFC [ 5 ] , the design and development of digital wallets [ 83 ] , and the use of mobile payment systems [ 61 ] —have highlighted both technical benefits and challenges associated with adopting payment digitization [ 51 , 66 ] . In our work , we extend the analysis of digitization internationally , looking at relationships between COVID - 19 rates and businesses moving online through the entire duration of the pandemic ( RQ2 ) . Furthermore , we aim to measure the rise of digital payments between businesses and consumers caused by COVID - 19 , focusing on specific periods of time that caused accelerated adoption of digital payment technologies in the United States ( RQ3 ) . 3 CSCW ’22 , Virtual Shaikh et al . 2 . 2 Digital Payments and Usability A potential drawback of switching from traditional cash payments to digital mediums are challenges associated with usability . Mustafa et al . [ 58 ] and Ibtasam et al . [ 38 ] highlight how digitization has potential to improve economic empowerment for women in patriarchal communities ; however , they also outline current usability problems that hinder the adoption of mobile money in these communities . Finally , digitization itself may also alienate individuals who are used to analog modes of payment [ 37 , 63 , 78 ] . Vines et al . [ 89 ] , for example , explores how elderly users find physical cheques a valuable mode of payment , and how the deprecation of cheques in the UK may initially affect general usability . On the other hand , payment providers are quick to emphasize the speed and ease of digital payments : digitized transactions simply require a swipe , tap , or click and are more secure [ 11 , 20 , 45 , 62 ] . Prior work on understanding the usability limitations of physical payments highlights issues related to accounting ( e . g . , counting the right amount change ) [ 39 ] , transportation , and safety . Furthermore , the prevalence of smartphones has enabled low - income communities to take advantage of mobile wallets . Banks—with relatively low penetration , safety concerns , and inconvenience—pose significant usability roadblocks ( compared to mobile phones ) in these communities [ 65 , 68 ] . Usability benefits also extend to online delivery services ( which use digital payments ) , potentially providing healthier food choices to communities in “food deserts”—regions where healthy food choices are scarce [ 28 ] . These aforementioned works are contextualized in a pre - COVID - 19 world . The pandemic , how - ever , has narrowed options for usable payments ; because the virus can spread through aerosolization [ 7 ] and potentially via physical currency [ 8 ] , sellers and buyers may find themselves in situations where in - person payments are not safe , rendering prior payment methods unusable . In some regions , restrictions on gathering size and dine - in restaurants spurred the adoption of digital payment options [ 2 ] . As a result , payment processing services like Mastercard have noticed a significant increase in digital and contactless payments driven by COVID - 19 [ 50 ] . To continue making payments usable , sellers may have had to adopt alternative payment acceptance methods ; to this end , our work briefly touches on cases where COVID - 19 forced some sellers to switch despite usability benefits lost from traditional cash transaction methods ( RQ1 , RQ2 ) . 2 . 3 International Variations Related to COVID - 19 In this work , we study all countries supported by a financial services company that provides optional digitization offerings to small businesses ; specifically , we analyze digitization in the US , GB , CA , JP , and AU . However , these countries have key variations that may cause differences in adopting digital payment techniques . In all of these countries , restrictions on gathering , stay at home mandates , business closures , and restrictions on international travel were all implemented in the early stages of the pandemic [ 34 ] . While the US , GB , CA , and AU enforced these safety measures through fines , JP just had these measures as recommendations [ 33 ] . Although COVID - 19 government interventions generally appeared early , international stringencies have varied significantly through the current duration of the pandemic [ 34 ] . From a fiscal perspective , each of the countries we studied had some sort of small business loan available , along with strategies for assistance to those who are unemployed . AU , JP , GB , and CA also had strong employment protection policies in place . For example , AU had the JobKeeper and JobSeeker initiatives that encouraged businesses to retain employees by paying $ 1 , 500 bi - weekly per employee to businesses [ 36 ] . Canada had the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program which covered up to 75 % of an employees’ salary for up to 3 months [ 18 ] . Similarly , GB offered the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme [ 69 ] , which initially allowed employers to claim 80 % of an employees salary in grants , or £2500 per month . Finally , in late April , Japan provided approximately 4 Online Payments During the COVID - 19 Pandemic CSCW ’22 , Virtual two - thirds of an employees wage if they were placed on furlough . In contrast , the US has the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP ) , which was targeted towards assisting businesses as a whole , instead of individual employees ( i . e . no direct wage subsidy programs ) [ 18 ] . Finally , international cash circulation rates also varied substantially prior to COVID - 19 . Thomas et al . [ 84 ] estimates that a majority of consumer transactions in Canada ( 57 % ) and United Kingdom ( 52 % ) were completed via “non - cash” methods . The United States sees similarly high levels ( 45 % ) of non - cash methods , while Australia and Japan see relatively lower rates ( 35 % and 14 % respectively ) . In our work , we suspect that these policy and regional variations may indirectly result in international differences in digitization . Through RQ2 , we quantify shifts in digitization and compare these shifts across countries , testing if significant digitization variations exist internationally . 2 . 4 Social Implications of COVID - 19 Prior work raises concerns about current and long - term social implications related to COVID - 19 , discussing topics like socioeconomic instability , elevated stress levels , disruption in K - 12 education , widespread uncertainty regarding the future of COVID - 19 , and long - term separation from family and loved ones [ 19 , 60 , 76 , 91 ] . A result of the COVID - 19 pandemic is increased psychological distress : McGinty et al . [ 54 ] compared levels and symptoms of psychological distress and loneliness in US adults between April 2020 and 2018 , finding increases in 2020 related to the spread of the COVID - 19 virus . Complementing this work , Saha et al . [ 75 ] analyzed increased mental health concerns caused by COVID - 19 , gauging the psychosocial effects of COVID - 19 on Twitter compared to 2019 . Social implications also apply to computer - mediated interactions : the virtualization of communication raises issues like “Zoom Fatigue , ” where reported exhaustion has increased due to frequent teleconference interactions [ 10 ] . Like prior psychosocial work , we also analyze the impact of COVID - 19 on behavioral changes . However , we focus on changes caused by the pandemic in the context of digital payment tech - nologies , looking at the immediate effects of initial government interventions in the United States ( RQ3 ) . Because the impact of COVID - 19 is region - dependent , we also aim to study digitization internationally , where restrictions have varied throughout the duration of the pandemic ; and where COVID cases have increased and decreased at different rates ( RQ2 ) . 2 . 5 Strategies for Moving Businesses Online Businesses can utilize various strategies to move their business online . In our work , we contextualize digitization through a pre - defined set of strategies . Although we aim to make these techniques generalizable , we note that they are inspired by services provided by the financial service company studied in this work . These strategies allow sellers to transition much or all of their payment flow to be contactless , minimizing risk of virus transmission . We analyze the adoption of these techniques as a whole ; in future work , we hope to understand specific scenarios where each of these distinct strategies are best utilized in the context of the COVID - 19 pandemic . In this work , however , we measure digitization through the use of only one of the following strategies ; specifically , a seller is considered to be “digitized” if they adopt at least one of the following in response to the pandemic or a government intervention . 2 . 5 . 1 Digital Delivery Services . One strategy for offering digital services involves the use of de - livering services and food to customers , through a mobile app . Example services that cater to restaurants , like Uber Eats , DoorDash , and GrubHub , have garnered significant attention since the start of the pandemic [ 81 ] . Complementary services that cater to retail , like Instacart , have also gained traction [ 40 ] . Sellers can adopt these techniques to offer contact - free delivery . For example , employees of delivery services can provide customers with the option to leave a delivered good at 5 CSCW ’22 , Virtual Shaikh et al . ( a ) Business Sector ( b ) Country Code Fig . 1 . Distribution of N = 993 surveyed businesses across Sector and Country their doorstep ; using delivery services allows customers to both minimize in - person interactions and reduce points of contact . 2 . 5 . 2 Online Catalogs and Menus . Another strategy associated with the growth of online commerce is the use of online menus and catalogs . These menus allow users to browse and order products offered at a business in a digital medium . Unlike delivery services , online catalogs and menus can be utilized when physically visiting a store . In some instances , users can also order through the digital menu itself . Sellers can display QR codes that link to menus or catalogs , reducing contact for both employees and customers by eliminating the need to touch a physical menu . 2 . 5 . 3 Digitally Assisted Curbside Pickup . In contrast to delivery services , some businesses offer curbside pickup , allowing users to pick up goods after ordering them online . Users can place an order online , then visit the business in person , where staff will bring the order to the curbside . Curbside pickup offers sellers a flexible method for continuing to take payments near their physical store , while decreasing opportunities for contact by limiting in - store interactions . 2 . 5 . 4 Invoicing Digitized Payments . Another feature that comes with the above techniques for digitizing payments is the ability to easily track and monitor payment history for sellers and customers [ 41 ] . All the aforementioned techniques come integrated with the ability to send digital invoices to customers’ personal devices , allowing sellers to retrieve , track , and analyze sent invoices . This enables both sellers and customers to record - keep payments in a contactless fashion . 3 DATASET COLLECTION OVERVIEW 3 . 1 Initial Dataset Source To collect our data , we partnered with Block Inc . , a financial services company . We specifically use data from Square ( a Block Inc . product ) . Square provides businesses with methods to digitize payments ( outlined in Section 2 . 5 ) . Our research focuses on small businesses using these digitization offerings , with small businesses being defined based on the U . S Small Business Administration ( SBA ) [ 4 ] as having less than 500 employees and generating less than 7 . 5 million USD in income [ 4 , 27 ] . When using our data , we followed privacy guidelines established by the company’s internal policies , accessing personally identifiable information only when necessary ( to contact businesses for surveys and interviews ) . From the financial services company , we first identified target businesses that remained active before and throughout a year of the pandemic . We also limited our target businesses to countries 6 Online Payments During the COVID - 19 Pandemic CSCW ’22 , Virtual ( a ) Digitization responses caused by the pandemic . The orange bar represents the subset of sellers who digitized specifically because of COVID related restrictions .

Other Businesses that do not fall into the aforementioned categories casual use , transportation , leisure and entertainment , charities , etc . Table 1 . Categorization of small business sectors , along with examples that fall into each categorization that were supported by the financial services company during this duration : United States ( US ) , Australia ( AU ) , Great Britain ( GB ) , Japan ( JP ) , and Canada ( CA ) . To identify active businesses , we selected sellers that took more than 1 . 5 payments per week on average between March 2019 and March 2021 , excluding federal holidays . Data on payment frequency was also made available through the financial services company . The March 2019 and March 2021 activity time - frame allowed us to select businesses that remained active one year before / after the initial COVID - 19 case surge in March 2020 1 . Our initial sample— after filtering for activity—consisted of about 400 , 000 businesses . From each of these businesses , we collected data on the business type , number of daily transactions , and the transaction medium ( i . e . if the transaction was completed digitally through the items listed in Section 2 . 5 , completed physically via a card , or through cash ) . All analysis in this work is derived from these initial businesses—for the next subsections , we cover how we construct subsets tailored towards each RQ . 1 Although we select for active businesses during this time - range , we still collect all payments , even if they were before / after the date ranges used to test for activity 7 CSCW ’22 , Virtual Shaikh et al .

Business names are anonymized for peer review . 3 . 2 Data for RQ1 : Surveys and Interviews for Digitization Challenges & Causes 3 . 2 . 1 Surveys . Using an email campaign , we reached out to a random sample of 20 , 000 sellers from the initial ≈ 400 , 000 ( described in Section 3 . 1 ) that remained active before / throughout the pandemic ; email addresses were collected through the financial services company’s database . Consisting of several multiple choice questions , our survey focused on understanding how payments were accepted during the pandemic . We asked about specific methods ( from Section 2 . 5 ) sellers used in their own business , reasons for switching to digital payment methods , and the speed of the transition itself . We also included optional free response questions asking for further feedback or observations about the speed and challenges associated with business digitization . Survey responses were anonymous at the individual level : respondents were not asked to input information about their name , gender , age , etc . We did , however , collect information about business sector , along with contact emails , directly through the financial services company’s internal database . Specific questions , along with details related to the survey platform , can be found in Appendix A . Our 993 respondents represented over 848 cities across 74 states / provinces and 4 countries ( US , AU , GB , CA ) . Respondents were distributed across several sectors as defined in Table 1 and highlighted in Figure 1 . We did not compensate individuals for responding to our survey . 3 . 2 . 2 Interviews . Alongside our survey , we also conducted semi - structured interviews with sellers who were in contact with the financial services company we study . We found these businesses either through their prior contact , or through a hot - line set up for businesses to contact the financial services company . We used a mixture of purposeful and convenience sampling to identify businesses whose characteristics were of interest to our work [ 73 ] . In all , we recruited 5 individuals who ran ( or helped run ) a small businesses that reported digitizing during the pandemic . These businesses were active for at least a year before the pandemic , and remained open ( or reopened ) after initial government interventions . To gain a global perspective , we interviewed business from all countries that supported digital payments ( AU , US , CA , JP ) , except for Great Britain . An overview on each business , along with their corresponding spokesperson , can be found in Table 2 . Each interview was about 30 to 50 minutes , and participants were compensated 50 USD for their time . Interviews were conducted either over the phone ( audio - only ) , or through video conferencing , depending on the preference of the spokesperson . We developed questions ( in Appendix A ) for our semi - structured interviews from our survey findings . During our interviews , we found that our participants often answered these questions before we asked them , so we only posited unanswered questions . Furthermore , if interviewees highlighted important information not included in our questions , we asked for clarifications on those observations . Limitations . Our initial survey dataset is subject to limitations : surveyed digitized sellers are potentially more likely to respond to an email , resulting in response bias . Furthermore , our survey was conducted in English , targeted towards English - speaking countries ( US , AU , GB , CA ) , since our 8 Online Payments During the COVID - 19 Pandemic CSCW ’22 , Virtual clustering methods ( Section 4 . 1 ) support only English . Finally , because of our interview sampling technique ( convenience sampling ) , our interviewees are not representative of all small businesses . 3 . 3 Data for RQ2 : International COVID - 19 Levels and Digitization Rates For our each of our countries ( Australia , Japan , Canada , Great Britain , and the United States ) present in our active businesses , we collected two different data subsets to answer when and how digitization levels changed with respect to COVID - 19 rates across countries . 3 . 3 . 1 Does COVID - 19 Predict Digitization ? First , we aim to quantitatively understand if COVID - 19 rates predicted digitization through the duration of the pandemic . We collect daily business digitization rates between 11 / 2019 and 7 / 2021 , for all selected businesses active during 1 year of the pandemic ( discussed in Section 3 . 1 ) : we select this entire time span to cover all past COVID - 19 surges , as seen in Figure 5 . Alongside business digitization share , we collect new 7 - day lagging COVID - 19 cases . Weekly national COVID - 19 case data is sourced from Max Roser and Hasell [ 53 ] . 3 . 3 . 2 Quantifying Initial Changes in Digitization . Next , we aim to understand how large of an initial digitization shift each country experienced , with respect to a control duration . We collect business digitization rates from a smaller timespan , using 11 / 2018 – 6 / 2019 as a control , and 11 / 2019 – 6 / 2020 as a treatment — 8 non - overlapping months of data for each group . We use these dates since initial interventions and COVID surges occurred at the midpoint of our selected time - frame ( in March 2020 ) . In Section 4 . 2 , we describe our experimental setup that utilizes this data . Fig . 3 . Data for RQ3 : Overall share of busi - nesses that have accepted an online pay - ment at a weekly level in the United States , compared between 2019 and 2020 . Limitations . For RQ2 , we only utilize data at an inter - national level , and do not collect business categories or segment payments by state / province due to limited ob - servations and dataset noise . Furthermore , a potential limitation of our international digitization datasets are a lack of coverage across digitization techniques : in Japan specifically , the financial services company we study sup - ported only digital invoices early in the pandemic ( March 2020 ) , and added additional features later . Although this work aggregates all digitization techniques , a potential avenue for future work ( discussed in Section 8 ) involves understanding the use of different digitization strategies . 3 . 4 Data for RQ3 : Digitization Rates and Intranational Factors for The United States For RQ3 , we use a subset of digitization data similar to Quantifying Initial Changes in Digitization from RQ2 ( 3 . 3 . 1 ) , but focus entirely on the United States instead of internationally . Unlike RQ2 , we stratify our data at the state and business category level , since we aim to identify relationships between business sectors and interventions in each state . We limit our analysis to the United States ( intranational / statewide level ) instead of a international / countrywide level for two reasons . 2 • A majority of our sellers ( > 80 % ) from both our survey and our initial set of 400 , 000 businesses reside in the United States . Segmenting datasets from other countries at an intrantional level 2 We also revisit these reasons / limitations in the discussion ( Section 8 . 8 ) . 9 CSCW ’22 , Virtual Shaikh et al .

Summary of Data Collection and Methodology . First , we qualitatively identify challenges and causes for digitization ( RQ1 ) . Next , we quantify international shifts in digitization and understand how they correlate with COVID - 19 ( RQ2 ) . Finally , we focus on the United States to better understand the role of regional factors ( interventions , political orientation , business sectors , etc . ) on digitization ( RQ3 ) . would yield sample - size problems ; further segmentation into business sectors would also be prohibitive . • Comprehensive collections of intranational intervention data were limited to a small subset of countries , which included the United States . Intersecting this subset with the list of countries supporting digitization techniques ( US , AU , GB , CA , JP ) left us with only the United States . State - level Factors & Intervention Data . After quantifying initial digitization shifts , we aim to explain potential regional factors in the U . S . that contribute to digitization . First , we collect intrana - tional government intervention data : to identify the type and enforcement date of interventions , we utilized the OxCRGT dataset [ 34 ] . OxCRGT consists of statewide and international data on policy interventions across federal and state governments . The dataset includes 18 indicators that highlight the “stringency” of an intervention . Among these indicators , OxCRGT provides several values that affect small business digitization , like government limitations on gathering size , and enforced restrictions on movement ( i . e . , stay - at - home mandates ) . We describe a subset of relevant values used in our work in Table 3 . Alongside these indicators , the dataset highlights specific dates when indicator values changed—for example , increases in gathering size and business closure values indicate the enforcement of policy interventions . We also collect COVID - 19 intensities and population density data for each state , in order to control for external effects that may also cause increases in digitization . For COVID - 19 intensities , we use data curated by The New York Times [ 3 ] , normalizing new cases per 500 , 000 people in a specified state . Finally , statewide population density data is collected from the 2010 US Census [ 85 ] . 4 METHODS Figure 4 summarizes our methodological approaches ; at a high level , we surface challenges and causes related to digitization through surveys and interviews ( RQ1 ) , quantify and compare digi - tization at an international scale ( RQ2 ) , and understand the effects on digitization across policy and business sector for small businesses in the US ( RQ3 ) . In all , our methods aim to paint a broad quantitative and qualitative picture of the digitization shift catalyzed by COVID - 19 . 10 Online Payments During the COVID - 19 Pandemic CSCW ’22 , Virtual 4 . 1 RQ1 : Identifying Challenges and Causes Related to Digitization Clustering Open - ended responses . To identify broader themes in our survey , we cluster open - ended responses . 38 % ( 380 ) of our 993 respondents provided open - ended responses to questions in our survey . To identify main topics associated with these open - ended responses , we first automatically cluster responses using natural language processing techniques . For our clustering techniques , we converted each open - ended response into a semantic representation vector , using SentenceBERT [ 72 ] . Next , we clustered these vectors with KMeans clustering , using SSE ( sum of squared errors ) to evaluate various values of 𝑘 ( Figure 10 , in Appendix ) . Using 𝑘 = 15 , we identified initial themes and manually recategorized misclassifications , merging clusters into 4 broader groups . 4 . 2 RQ2 & RQ3 : Quantifying Digitization with an Interrupted Time Series Model For both RQ2 & RQ3 , we aim to quantify the shift in digitization . Though RQ2 focuses on digi - tization across countries ( internationally ) , and RQ3 focuses on digitization in the United States ( intranationally ) , we use the same quasi - experimental methodology to identify if digitization shifts ( during 11 / 2019 – 6 / 2020 ) were significant compared to a control time - span ( 1 / 2018 – 6 / 2019 ) . Prior work on understanding effects on social media for COVID - 19 , along with research on applying inter - rupted time series models to study social network activity , motivated our approach [ 21 , 22 , 74 , 75 ] . Furthermore , utilizing a control dataset at a region level allows us to control for geographic factors and seasonality trends within these regions , adjusting for external effects on payment transactions . By highlighting the effects of digitization on an experimental and control time span , we can make claims about the effect of COVID - 19 on the rate of digitization . Bucketing Payments . First , we bin payments from sellers in a selected region into daily buckets— where each bucket corresponds to a single set of counts . Businesses are counted as “digitized” at a specific point in time , if they have taken at least one payment per day using a strategy discussed in Section 2 . 5 . These strategies are also the same as those covered in our Background section and our surveys ( delivery services , curbside pickup , online catalogs and menus ) . We also split payment digitization rates into two periods : 𝑃 𝑝𝑟𝑒 , and 𝑃 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 , indicating the payments before or after a split point . For RQ2 , we select March 1 as a split point , since interventions generally appear in these countries after this date [ 34 ] . For RQ3 , we utilize our collected intervention data to identify a split point at the first COVID - 19 related intervention in a state . General Interrupted Time Series Model . We aim to compare digitization interruptions across regions ( countries and states ) to understand if some countries digitized significantly more than others in response to the pandemic . To quantify the initial digitization shift , we utilize an interrupted time series ( ITS ) strategy [ 14 ] to identify if business digitization increased significantly following an intervention . Using ITS allows us to account for changes due to policy interventions even in the presence of temporal trends . Importantly , ITS regresses on temporal variables from the dataset as part of the inference process , instead of assuming independence between pre - and post - intervention periods . ITS uses a binary variable 𝛿 ( 𝑡 > 𝜏 ) to indicate if a data point 𝑦 𝑡 occurs after a post intervention period ( i . e . , if 𝑦 𝑡 falls into 𝑃 𝑝𝑟𝑒 or 𝑃 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 ) . In our ITS models , 𝑦 𝑡 corresponds to the count of digitizing sellers at day 𝑡 . For our underlying probability distribution function 𝑓 , we use the Poisson distribution ; however , we include an offset term 𝑙𝑜𝑔 ( 𝑁 ) to account for the total number of active businesses 𝑁 in a given day 𝑡 . We include 𝑎 𝑡 to regress on time , adjusting for potential seasonality trends . Finally , 𝑧 indicates if the data belongs to the control or treatment group . RQ2 International ITS . For RQ2’s ITS model , we include interaction terms to model increases across countries 𝑐 . 11 CSCW ’22 , Virtual Shaikh et al . 𝑦 𝑡 ∼ 𝑎 𝑡 + 𝛿 ( 𝑡 > 𝜏 ) · 𝑧 · 𝑐 ( 1 ) 𝑙𝑜𝑔 ( 𝑦 𝑡 ) = 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1 · 𝑎 𝑡 + 𝛽 2 · 𝛿 ( 𝑡 > 𝜏 ) + 𝛽 3 · 𝛿 ( 𝑡 > 𝜏 ) · 𝑧 + 𝛽 4 · 𝛿 ( 𝑡 > 𝜏 ) · 𝑧 · 𝑐 + 𝑙𝑜𝑔 ( 𝑁 ) ( 2 ) RQ3 United States ITS . For RQ3’s ITS model , we extend the model in RQ2 to include shifts across 𝑏 business categories , and replace 𝑐 country for 𝑠 state to model intranational variations . 𝑦 𝑡 ∼ 𝑎 𝑡 + 𝛿 ( 𝑡 > 𝜏 ) · 𝑧 · 𝑠 · 𝑏 ( 3 ) 𝑙𝑜𝑔 ( 𝑦 𝑡 ) = 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1 · 𝑎 𝑡 + 𝛽 2 · 𝛿 ( 𝑡 > 𝜏 ) + 𝛽 3 · 𝛿 ( 𝑡 > 𝜏 ) · 𝑧 + 𝛽 4 · 𝛿 ( 𝑡 > 𝜏 ) · 𝑧 · 𝑠 + 𝛽 5 · 𝛿 ( 𝑡 > 𝜏 ) · 𝑧 · 𝑠 · 𝑏 + 𝑙𝑜𝑔 ( 𝑁 ) ( 4 ) 4 . 3 RQ2 : Highlighting General International Digitization Trends Granger Causality : Using COVID - 19 Rates to Predict Digitization . To understand if COVID - 19 levels and digitization rates correlate internationally , we use Granger’s causality analysis [ 30 ] , a technique grounded in econometrics . Granger’s causality assumes that if a time series 𝑋 causes another time series 𝑌 , then changes in 𝑋 will occur consistently ahead of changes in 𝑌 . If lagging time series 𝑋 behind 𝑌 results in 𝑋 predicting changes in 𝑌 , Granger’s causality test will highlight a significant correlation between 𝑋 and 𝑌 . Granger’s causality test also assumes that time series data is stationary ( i . e . , does not have underlying seasonal trends ) ; we utilize the Dickey - Fulller test [ 26 ] to ensure our tested time series data is stationary . Finally , correlation from Granger’s test does not imply causation ; instead , it indicates that one time series dataset has predictive information regarding another time series dataset . In the context of testing RQ2 , we look for correlations between weekly changes in COVID rates ( 𝑋 ) and changes in share of digitized businesses ( 𝑌 ) . To obtain 𝑋 and 𝑌 , we transform our original time series data , which consists of COVID cases / M and digitization share at day 𝑡 . To account for weekend trends , we smooth our digitization data : first , we group our data by week 𝑤 , then use a difference transformation ( subtracting week 𝑤 − 1 from week 𝑤 ) . Our time series data then represents the weekly change in COVID cases or digitization . An added benefit of grouping and the difference transformation is a potential removal of seasonality trends , which satisfies a requirement of the Granger causality test . Results from the Dickey - Fuller test show that all time series pairs 𝑋 and 𝑌 for our selected regions have 𝑝 < . 05 , reinforcing that our transformed data is stationary ( without seasonality ) and appropriate for Granger’s causality test . 4 . 4 RQ3 : Interventions and Digitization in The United States Linear Regression : Identifying Relationships between State - level Factors and Digitization . Govern - ment interventions consist of various factors that make up the stringency of the response itself . To understand what elements of stringency may have played a role in the initial set of mandates outlined by state - level governments , we utilize subfactors from the OxCRGT dataset as independent variables to predict digitization rates in a state . All variables are documented in Table 3 . Specifically , we select values for each regression variable ( Table 3 ) from the initial week that mandates were enforced in a selected state . Our dependent variable is the average digitization rate in a state from the initial mandate to 6 / 2020 . As part of the regression , we also include control variables for the political orientation of a state ( using Republican vote - share during the 2020 election ) , the COVID intensity at the time an intervention was enforced , and the weighed population density of a state . Prior work indicates that adherence to mandates may be dependent on the political polarization in the United States [ 6 , 48 ] ; by including political orientation , we aim to understand if this effect also exists for digitization . For COVID intensity , we include a predictor 12 Online Payments During the COVID - 19 Pandemic CSCW ’22 , Virtual Dependent Variable Definition Post - mandate Digitization Proportion of digital businesses in a state after initial intervention .

Definitions of variables used in our linear regression to understand state - level factors that contribute to digitization ( Section 4 . 4 ) . Each of these variables communicates a different type / level of restriction , or relevant contextual factor . Italicized control variables are not included in the original OxCRGT dataset . Our regression is formulated as : PostMandateDigitization = 𝛼 + (cid:205) 𝑛 ∈ factors 𝛽 𝑛 Factors 𝑛 . for the average number of cases in the last 7 days immediately before the mandate per 10 , 000 people , sourced from The New York Times [ 3 ] . We also include a log - scaled weighed population density predictor as another control . Instead of using the raw population density from the census data , we weigh population density by population concentration in each census tract at a state - level , following methodology from how the US Census analyzes metro - level population concentrations to understand urbanization [ 92 ] . Using weighed densities allows us to account for potential population density skews caused by states with large , sparsely populated rural areas . Finally , we re - scale all bounded variables to between [ 0 , 1 ] , log - scale unbounded variables , and perform linear regression on these variables to predict the average post - mandate for a state . 5 RQ1 RESULTS : BUSINESS DIGITIZATION SURVEY & INTERVIEWS In this section , we answer RQ1—identifying challenges and causes associated with digitization— through a survey analyses and interviews with small businesses . 5 . 1 Survey Findings The pandemic catalyzed the transition to digitization for a significant proportion of sellers . 25 . 2 % of sellers from our survey responded that the pandemic forced them to find methods to digitize their payment transactions . Excluding sellers that already had a digital presence , businesses that moved online due to the pandemic accounted for 46 . 6 % of the responses . Several respondents , 13 CSCW ’22 , Virtual Shaikh et al . who did not rely on digitization prior to the pandemic , highlighted the usefulness of adopting digitization techniques : " Digital invoicing has been a big help ! I’m able to send the customer a digital invoice after service is performed then they pickup their system from our secured weather proof pickup box outside our door . " - Retail One respondent noted that they would’ve moved to online payments earlier during the pandemic given its success at their business . “I would have launched an online order site earlier if I would have predicted it’s success and had the time . ” - Food & Drink We also asked users how quickly they had to digitize due to the pandemic , and if a stay - at - home mandate was the cause of their transition . Excluding businesses that already had a digital presence , 79 . 3 % noted that they needed to switch payment transaction methods in less than a week ( Figure 2 ) ; 22 . 7 % reported that a stay - at - home mandate specifically caused them to digitize payments . Finally , of businesses that adopted new techniques because of the pandemic , 78 . 4 % indicated that they would continue to offer digital payment services after the pandemic was over . Although some businesses were affected by the pandemic , others were not required or able to change much about their payment flow to remain open . One respondent observed that the lack of change was due to the business sector ; some sectors , like the medical field or service - oriented businesses , may not require as drastic a shift as other sectors : “Medical field , nothing really changed other than putting payments in my hand . ” Several other respondents whose businesses were already working in services like tele - medicine or online mental health consulting highlighted a similar trend , while other businesses started offering online counterparts for the in - person offerings . “I own a [ n ] [ online ] mental health practice and the pandemic increased the utilization of our services . ” - Health Care & Fitness Because some business sectors are tightly coupled to digitized or non - digitized techniques , changing payment methods may be a significant challenge . For service sectors , adjusting to a digital medium posed usability problems to potential customers . Some businesses already had a digital presence that grew in usage due to the pandemic . 46 . 1 % of all respondents already had a digital presence set up before the pandemic , utilizing a spectrum of digitization techniques . One respondent highlighted their transition from physical to digital receipts / invoices . “I use the invoice feature and the online store a lot more now . . . it has allowed us to be completely contactless . ” - Retail Another respondent also highlighted an increased use in digitization ; however , they highlight usability problems related to adopting digitized payments for older individuals , an observation reflected in Vines et al . [ 89 ] . To remain contactless , sellers might be required to teach users how digital or online payments work . “We were already adopters of digital / card payments before the pandemic , so it was not a challenging transition for us . However , many older customers needed to be educated ; that was the biggest challenge . ” - Retail Although digitization is promoted as an option for making payments more secure , some businesses noted that customers have a general distrust of taking payments online . “Still some members of the public are worried of scams and take online payments as a risk . [ ANON ] appears very secure but we have to adapt when clients don’t want to “risk” online payments . ” - Retail 14 Online Payments During the COVID - 19 Pandemic CSCW ’22 , Virtual Theme P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 Started digitizing during COVID - 19 ( limited online presence before ) ✗ ✗ ✓ ✓ ✓ Experimented with online product line throughout COVID - 19 ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Experienced usability issues with older individuals ✓ ✓ ✗ ✓ ✓ Highlighted interventions as a direct cause for digitization ✓ ✓ ✓ ✗ ✓ Will continue using digital payment techniques after COVID - 19 ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Digital offerings will become main source of revenue ✗ ✗ ✗ ✓ ✗ Table 4 . Summary of themes in interviews . In general , we noticed that some respondents simply switched over to their pre - existing digital infrastructure . A few sellers mentioned that having these options set up allowed for a transition into a post - pandemic payments world . “Having [ digitization ] in place already enabled us to continue seamlessly into the pandemic . We already offered delivery , shipping and pickup , so , fortunately for us , we were already ahead of that curve . ” - Food & Drink Businesses relied on several digitization techniques to remain online , and most plan to continue using them after the pandemic . Of the first three digitization strategies 3 documented in Section 2 . 5 ( Digital Delivery Services , Online Catalogs and Menus , and Digitally Assisted Curbside Pickup ) , 54 . 2 % of businesses relied on more than one strategy . Furthermore , of businesses that started using digitization because of the pandemic , 86 . 3 % of businesses plan to continue using at least 1 strategy that they adopted beyond the COVID - 19 pandemic ; that is , businesses that previously didn’t use digital payment acceptance techniques will offer them after the pandemic . 5 . 2 Interview Findings Older and Younger Generations . All our participants independently highlighted a divide be - tween younger and older generations when adopting digital payment technologies because of the pandemic . P1 highlighted issues related to trust , along with general usability concerns raised by older individuals when using eCommerce sites . However , alongside these concerns , P1 highlighted how digitization also allowed her to offer appointment oriented services ( scheduled digitally ) , catering to clientele who preferred an in - person experience when shopping for clothes . P2 also highlighted an analogous problem for dining experiences – delivery services are often challenging for older individuals to navigate . In these cases , both P2 and P4 discussed instances where younger relatives would order online on behalf of older individuals as a form of gifting . Business sectors , like in our survey , also appeared to affect how businesses moved online . P3 , for example , talked about how his specific sector ( a bar serving craft beer ) attracted a younger customer demographic , resulting in reduced usability issues for his online store . Beyond business sector , P3 also independently raised Japan’s younger generation’s rapidly changing cultural norms as a factor behind changes in digitization . “Before the pandemic , [ digitization ] already started with credit cards . You could see [ our customers ] felt cool pulling out that card , which was a new thing . I saw this more and more : like guy on a date . It’s like boom , card – that was the cool move . COVID just accelerated that trend here . ” - P3 3 We did not survey for Digital Invoicing , since using any of the other strategies implies use of invoicing . 15 CSCW ’22 , Virtual Shaikh et al . When we asked P3 how these norms shifted over time , P3 highlighted how digital payment techniques were starting to become more convenient over the last decade , and were integrating useful point systems . We revisit these qualities—digitizing social norms through online gifting , point systems , etc . during COVID - 19—in our discussion . Interventions and Proactiveness . Digitization occurred immediately at the start of the pan - demic , for all our interviewed businesses . Following initial restrictions and surges in COVID - 19 cases , moving online was not a gradual process . Interviewed businesses shifted online immediately during the first surge , in preparation for future uncertainty . P2 , for example , highlighted how moving online was a robust solution to the 2nd lockdown in Australia . “It’s not enough for a business to operate as usual . You always have keep finding ways to adapt , grow and challenge the norm . We asked – what will this mean for us , not only in the current landscape , but in the future “normal” , whatever that might be . ” - P2 While discussing online payments , participants also highlighted how online options complemented ( and never replaced ) their in - store experience ; moving online helped businesses extend their offerings and prepare for future uncertainty : “ [ Our online store ] hasn’t become our main line of business . I mean , we’re a bar , by any means . But it’s definitely enabled us to do things that we’d normally be able to do without it . ” - P3 . Experimenting with Going Online . For some of our interviewed businesses , the role of online stores and digital payments were and are still in flux . Although businesses digitized early in response to interventions , their offerings shifted in response to ( 1 ) what was scalable online and ( 2 ) what customers wanted while in lockdown . During P5’s interview , P5 brainstormed ideas on digitizing social interactions through a podcast , replicating some of the in - person characteristics of a bar . All interviewed businesses discussed how their catalogs were experimentally refined during the duration of lockdowns and stay - at - home orders . They specifically highlighted how , despite experimentation , there’s a distinctly different experience between the online store and the in - person experience . Specifically , P1 and P5 mentioned how in - person experiences allow businesses to easily personalize a shopping experience to a given customer , building loyalty . P1 also discussed how scheduling in - person appointments online is a potential middle - ground between both experiences . Alongside scheduling appointments , P1 discussed her interactive online store , where she integrating 3D maps of her physical business in her catalog . Beyond experimenting with online catalogs , P3 tried different digitization techniques , offering delivery at the start of the pandemic . However , logistical issues with delivering food resulted in P3 scheduling pickups instead . Although 4 of our 5 participants indicated that online stores served to complement in - person interactions , P4 pivoted his Makerspace from offering in - person services to goods on an online store . He mentioned that his online store may become a main source of revenue following the pandemic , even when full in - person operations resume . 6 RQ2 RESULTS : INTERNATIONAL COVID - 19 DIGITIZATION In this section , we aim to analyze relationships between COVID - 19 rates and international differ - ences in digitization ( RQ2 ) , highlighting the scale of observations from RQ1 . To this end , we ask if COVID - 19 predicts digitization from all regions in our dataset between 11 / 2019 and 7 / 2021 . Then , we quantify the initial digitization shift in these regions , comparing differences internationally . 6 . 1 COVID - 19 Rates and Digitization Through the Duration of the Pandemic Since the onset of the COVID - 19 pandemic , rates of COVID have varied both over time and across regions . Qualitatively , this observation can be seen in Figure 5 , where local maximas in COVID - 19 16 Online Payments During the COVID - 19 Pandemic CSCW ’22 , Virtual Fig . 5 . COVID - 19 cases / M people and Share of Digitized Businesses from all Supported Countries . Selected Local Maxima for case rates are indicated using a dashed grey line . Qualitatively , changes in COVID - 19 rates do not appear to correlate with changes in digitization ( aside from 1st surge ) . JP AU US CA GB 𝑙𝑎𝑔 𝑝 val . 𝐹 stat . 𝑝 val . 𝐹 stat . 𝑝 val .

Results for Granger causality test on changes in new COVID cases / M ( 𝑋 ) causing changes in businesses digitizing ( 𝑌 ) , for varying lags ( 1 week to 4 weeks ) applied to 𝑋 . No setting for lag yields statistically significant results at reasonable 𝑝 values . Therefore , we fail to reject our null hypothesis ( lagged COVID - 19 cases do not explain changes in digitization ) . rates generally do not correspond to increases in digitization . Granger’s causality test quantitatively confirms these observations : results on time series pairs representing changes in COVID rates and digitized businesses are shown in Table 5 . We fail to reject our null hypothesis ( lagged COVID - 19 cases do not explain changes in digitization ) ; for any setting of lag between 1 to 4 weeks , COVID - 19 rates are not predictive of digitization share through the current duration of the pandemic . Our Granger Causality test indicates that COVID - 19 fluctuations occurring throughout the pandemic do not affect digitization . From these results , we suspect that sellers digitized early in the pandemic . As highlighted in our surveys & interviews , when COVID cases surged again , sellers already had digital infrastructure to handle accepting payments . In Section 7 , we revisit relationships between COVID - 19 rates and digitization , analyzing payments in the U . S . 6 . 2 International Variations on Digitization We hypothesized that cultural and policy variation would have an effect on digitization internation - ally : different countries are more / less digitally averse than others . As mentioned in our background 17 CSCW ’22 , Virtual Shaikh et al . ( Section 2 . 3 ) , a noteworthy example is Japan : historically , Japan’s dependence on cash has remained significantly higher than most countries’ [ 87 ] , so we expected a lower digitization rate in this region compared to others . Qualitatively , we find this trend reflected in digitization despite changes in COVID - 19 rates throughout the pandemic ( Figure 3 ) . Throughout the pandemic , digitization in Japan appears lower than all other countries , even though COVID rates are generally higher in Japan than in Australia ( even though AU saw a higher shift in digitization ) . Even though Japan’s digitization rates are lower , we still see nearly a 50 % increase in digital businesses from our ITS model , compared to our 2018 - 2019 control . Fig . 6 . Increase in Log Odds ( 𝛾 from all state - level ITS Models ) after March 2020 for US , AU , and JP . All countries are significantly different from one another ( JP < AU = GB < US < CA , 𝑝 < . 025 , two - tailed 𝛾 from ITS ) . In Figure 6 , we highlight the summed interaction pa - rameters ( from our ITS model ) for the interruption in JP , AU , US , GB , and CA , along with corresponding con - fidence intervals . Converting the 𝛾 log - coefficients to relative % changes ( using an 𝑒 𝛾 transform ) results in a 48 . 64 % , 57 . 2 % , 58 . 3 % , 67 . 4 % , 71 . 12 % increase in digitization for JP , AU , GB , US and CA respectively . Each of these relative changes have statistically significant differences except for AU and GB , with Japan having the smallest interruption and the CA having the largest ( compared to pre - intervention time spans . ) 7 RQ3 RESULTS : UNITED STATES CASE STUDY , INITIAL DIGITIZATION In Section 6 , we looked at international digitization , find - ing that businesses generally digitized early in the pan - demic ( instead of alongside COVID - 19 surges ) , and at sig - nificantly different rates . In this section , we dive deeper into early digitization , quantifying increases in the United States following initial COVID - 19 interventions . We use an interrupted time series technique [ 14 ] ( Section 4 . 2 ) alongside a linear regression ( Section 4 . 4 ) to identify the effect of noteworthy regional factors ( i . e . , stay - at - home mandates , restrictions on gatherings , political polarization ; subset described in Table 3 ) on the adoption of online payments . Finally , we highlight differences in digitization across business sectors . 7 . 1 Increases in Digitization Following Mandates Following government intervention , a significant number of sellers actively began using digitization to continue taking payments . Qualitatively , this trend is visible on a national level : Figure 3 highlights an increase in share of digitized businesses during the range of dates where government interventions were initially enforced . The absolute percent increase in national digitization before and after all initial government response is 9 % ( from Figure 3 ) . However , because the United States did not enforce a national mandate , we limit statistical tests in this section to the state - level . Because of the lack of federal mandates , we examine statewide intervention effects on digitization . For our interrupted time series models , we noticed that all states had an overall significant change in digitization compared to the 2019 control group , with the 𝛾 median interruption across significant states at 0 . 65 ( corresponding to a relative 93 . 5 % increase of digitizing merchants ) ; an overview of statewide variations can be seen in Figure 7 . This digitization occurs very quickly : our ITS regression models indicate that all increases in significant states occur within a timeframe of 3 weeks following interventions , then stabilize . 18 Online Payments During the COVID - 19 Pandemic CSCW ’22 , Virtual Fig . 7 . Increase in Log Odds ( 𝛾 from all state - level ITS Models ) after March 2020 Business and Gathering Mandates for all business sectors , compared to March 2018 – 2019 control group .

OLS Regression on Predicting Post - Mandate Digitization Rates After Initial Mandate Enforcement . Adjusted 𝑅 2 ≈ . 856 . All interlabel correlations are negligible , except for Republican Vote Share and Weighed Population Density ( 𝑅 2 = . 63 ) . * * denotes 𝑝 < 0 . 05 , * * * denotes 𝑝 < 0 . 01 These quantitative results align with our initial survey findings : a majority of respondents attributed digitization to the presence of an intervention , and were forced to digitize in less than a month . Our ITS model quantifies the significance and speed of this interruption identified in our surveys , finding that the enforcement of government mandates—a result of the COVID - 19 pandemic—may cause an increase in digitization . However , the variation between overall statewide digitization ( 𝛾 : 0 . 65 ± . 15 std , also seen in Figure 7 ) indicates that other underlying factors behind government intervention are affecting the adoption of digital payment techniques . We explore these interactions ( between state - level factors and digitization ) in the next section . 7 . 2 Relationships Between State Level Factors and Digitization To understand how underlying policy intervention factors affect digitization , we use several regional factors to predict statewide increases in digitization using a linear regression model . Of the documented factors ( in Table 3 ) , restrictions on gatherings , the political orientation of the state , population density , pre - mandate digitization , and COVID intensity are significant at 𝑝 < . 05 in our regression model . 19 CSCW ’22 , Virtual Shaikh et al . For the restrictions on gatherings variable , the OxCRGT dataset distinguishes the degree of the requirement itself , categorizing government response into 4 levels of varying stringency . An example of the least ( 1 ) and most ( 4 ) stringent requirements are quoted below . “ Beginning March 13 , 2020 , all public and private gatherings in the State of Illinois of 1 , 000 or more people are cancelled for the duration of the Gubernational Disaster Proclamation . A public or private gathering does not include normal school or work attendance . ” – Illinois , Level 1 Restriction ( > = 1000 people ) “ Effective March 28 , 2020 , at 5 : 00 P . M . , all non - work related gatherings of 10 persons or more , or non - work related gatherings of any size that cannot maintain a consistent six - foot distance between persons from different households , are prohibited . ” – Alabama , Level 4 Restriction ( > = 10 people ) According to our linear regression model ( Table 6 ) , if all other factors are held constant , recommend - ing the restriction of gatherings results in a ≈ 1 % increase in digitization ( coef / 4 to account for rescaling ) . Incrementing the stringency of gathering restrictions results in further ≈ 1 % increases in digitization . Interestingly , we find that other restrictions ( like restrictions on internal movement ) are not significantly correlated with digitization ; we suspect that , because restrictions on gatherings generally came earlier than restrictions on movement [ 34 ] , sellers may have been more proactive in digitizing given signs of the pandemic progressing . When / if states later enforced a stay - at - home requirement , some businesses were already prepared to take payments online . Another significant independent variable in our regression is Republican Vote Share from the 2020 election . We suspect that this factor is significant due to urbanization ( measured by Weighed Population Density ) correlating with the political orientation of a state—urbanized regions may be more receptive to adopting digital payment techniques [ 57 ] . Furthermore , precautionary COVID responses appear to be a partisan issue : Gollwitzer et al . [ 31 ] finds that in the presence of stay - at - home orders , adherence to social distancing measures is strongly related to political affiliation . Our model reflects a similar finding : a 1 % increase ( holding all other factors constant ) in Republican Vote Share results in ≈ - 11 % decrease in digitization . Finally , facial coverings and workplaces closing do not contribute to the predicted change in digitization . At a state - level , facial coverings were generally not mandated at the onset of the pandemic . For workplaces closing , we expected a decrease in digitization since businesses would be closed entirely ; we leave further qualitative and quantitative validation to future work . Fig . 8 .

Pseudo 𝑅 2 ≈ . 69 . 7 . 3 Relationships Between Business Category and Digitization Our survey results from RQ1 suggest a relationship between business sector and challenges as - sociated with digitization . One respondent implied how service sector work requires in - person interaction , limiting the effectiveness and usability of payment digitization . Qualitatively , trends across sectors are visible at the national level : Figure 8 highlights the same payments as Figure 3 , segmented across selected business sectors . Some sectors , like Food & Drink and Retail , reflect a significant increase in digitization over the span of initial mandates , while other sectors like Professional Services & Home and Repair highlight a low or reduced share of digitizing businesses . Quantifying the significance of digitization at the state level through our ITS models ( results in Table 7 ) highlights similar trends . Overall , all states have significantly higher rates of digitization following an initial mandate compared to their 2019 control period . However , the number of significant states , along with increases in digitization , varies substantially with business sector . Food and Drink related businesses , for example , see significant increases in 50 states , while Home and Repair related businesses see significant increases in only 18 states . Similar to findings discussed in RQ1 , our state - level quantitative analyses reinforce hypotheses raised by our survey participants . Service sectors may not be able to digitize effectively due to the mode of the service itself . A noteworthy exception to this trend is the Healthcare and Fitness sector ; compared to other service oriented sectors ( Professional Services and Home & Repair ) , Healthcare and Fitness sees a substantially higher % increase . We further discuss reasons behind why these differences exist , along with avenues for future work , in our discussion section ( Section 8 ) . 8 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION In our work , we study how small businesses reacted in response to the COVID - 19 pandemic . Specifically , we analyze how these businesses move their services online when adhering to social distancing and government mandates . We contextualize moving online ( i . e . , digitization ) through the use of several strategies , and study how the adoption of these strategies as a whole changed based on both policy and pre - existing social factors . Compared to prior work , we complement a user survey with a large - scale international quantitative analysis of digitization that occurred due to COVID - 19 , analyzing tens of millions of payments from over 400 , 000 businesses . From our mixed - method approach , we contribute several findings across our research questions , adding to prior work [ 9 , 13 , 44 , 55 ] focusing on understanding the adoption of digitization caused by COVID - 19 . Our research findings are summarized in Table 8 . In this section , we further discuss implications with respect to the surprising scale and speed of business digitization observed in this 21 CSCW ’22 , Virtual Shaikh et al . Research Question Summarized Findings RQ1 : Digitization Causes / Challenges • 46 . 4 % of businesses cited COVID - 19 as initial reason to digitize . • About 80 % proactively moved online , in under one month . • 76 . 4 % will continue using digitization adopted during pandemic ; however , they are experimenting with the role of digital payments . • Service oriented sectors face more challenges with digitization ( consulting , makerspaces , etc . ) , compared to goods ( e . g . retail ) . • Older customers were apprehensive , citing trust and safety issues ; digital gifting norms offer a solution . • Cultural norms associated with cash ( in Japan ) slowed digitization ; however , these norms are shifting because of COVID - 19 . RQ2 : International Digitization • In general , international COVID - 19 rates did not correlate with digitization , except for 1st surge—evidence for early digitization . • At minimum , all countries saw a 47 % increase following initial COVID - 19 surge , compared to a non - COVID timespan . • Countries digitized at different rates : JP < AU = GB < US < CA . RQ3 : U . S . Digitization Case Study • All states saw significant digitization increases ( 93 . 5 % compared to non - COVID timespan ) following initial mandates . • Restrictions on gatherings , political orientation , initial COVID - 19 intensity positively correlate with state - level digitization . • Different business sectors digitized at significantly different rates : Food & Drink > Retail > Health Care > Misc . Services • Health Care & Fitness ( e . g . Telehealth ) showed exceptional in - creases ( 89 % compared to non - COVID ) as a service sector . Table 8 . Summary of findings for research questions . work . Importantly , these implications may generalize beyond COVID - 19—our work highlights a potentially long - lasting shift in how payments are accepted around the world . 8 . 1 Small Business Proactiveness and Early Digitization Interestingly , we found that only early government interventions and early surges in COVID - 19 cases correlated with digitization shifts . After these interventions , businesses maintained levels of digitization , regardless of subsequent shifts in COVID - 19 rates . From our findings in RQ3 , we noticed that restrictions on gatherings—which often preceded stay - at - home mandates—were the only significant restriction ( 𝑝 < . 05 ) in our model when predicting digitization . We suspect that early restrictions caused small business to move online , potentially in preparation for more severe government interventions . Proactiveness is also reflected internationally : we noticed that as COVID - 19 rates fluctuated around the world , digitization only saw a single inflection point early ( March 2020 ) in the pandemic . Following March 2020 interventions and the initial COVID - 19 maxima , businesses stayed digitized even as some regions saw COVID - 19 rates decrease substantially . Weatherproofing for Future Interventions . Our surveys and interviews expand on our quantitative observation regarding early digitization . Businesses discussed moving online quickly in anticipation of changing interventions . To summarize , about 80 % of surveyed businesses transitioned in under a week . Furthermore , interviewed businesses cited digitization as a form of “weatherproofing ; ” because of the uncertainty regarding changing interventions , having any alternative form of 22 Online Payments During the COVID - 19 Pandemic CSCW ’22 , Virtual accepting payments was critical to remaining open . In the event of future government mandated lockdowns or public health risks , businesses would be well prepared to continue taking payments . Experimenting with the Role of Digital Payments After Early Digitization . Although businesses shifted online early , our quantitative results do not capture how businesses continued experimenting with their digital offerings as restrictions varied . For our interviewed and surveyed sellers , however , moving online was an iterative process . Digitization did occur early for these small businesses ; however , feedback from customers caused businesses to shift what digitization techniques they used . We suspect that given initial usability concerns , businesses experimented ( and are still experimenting ) with their newly digitized stores . Furthermore , businesses are still in the process of identifying the specific role digital payments play in the context of their in - person offerings . 8 . 2 Potential Interactions Between Social Factors and Digitization Current Social Norms and Digitization . Another finding of our work highlights potential interac - tions between pre - existing social norms and the digitization of a region . We find two examples where pre - existing social factors appear to correlate with digitization : political polarization and a cultural reliance on cash . In the United States , political orientation appears to affect digitization : increases in GOP vote share from the 2020 election correlate with decreases in digitization . Prior work also highlights the effect of adherence to mandates ( specifically social distancing ) in the context of political polarization [ 31 ] . In our work , we show that political orientation transfers to proactive digitization ; although digitization itself was never mandated , the adoption of digitization still correlates with the political orientation of a state . These implications are also reflected internationally . From our brief analysis in Section 6 , we found that Japan’s digitization lagged behind other countries . We suspect that Japan’s pre - existing social norms ( and correspondingly high cash circulation [ 59 ] ) prevented digitization at the same scale as seen in other countries . Mainwaring et al . [ 47 ] qualitatively studies how pre - existing social factors are a potential cause for relatively high use of cash - based transactions ( in 2015 , only 18 % of payments in Japan were cashless , according to estimates from the World Bank [ 59 ] ) . The specific factors that Mainwaring et al . [ 47 ] studies are meiwaku and tokushita . To summarize , avoiding meiwaku means avoiding commotion : paying by card—especially for a small expense – might require entering a PIN code , or waiting for a transaction to be approved . On the other hand , achieving tokushita means achieving some personal gain for a transaction , potentially through a loyalty program . Our work provides quantitative evidence that supports conclusions drawn in Mainwaring et al . [ 47 ] regarding meiwaku and tokushita ; despite surges in COVID - 19 cases , digitization in Japan was significantly lower compared to other countries . We suspect that these social norms—intertwined with Japan’s dependence on cash—limited overall digitization . Implications : Shifting Social Norms during COVID - 19 . Although pre - existing norms appear to affect digitization , these norms appear to be shifting in response to the pandemic . Despite digitization differences across regions , every location studied in our quantitative analyses ( RQ2 , RQ3 ) still saw significant increases in business moving online . Furthermore , digitized businesses are not reverting to traditional payment acceptance techniques , even in regions where government interventions were relaxed , or where COVID - 19 levels decreased significantly from their peaks . Another shifting norm—increased online gifting—concerns the usability gap between older and younger generations . In the next section we discuss this usability gap along with its exacerbation in the context of COVID - 19 ; furthermore , we highlight how shifting online payment norms and how specific digitization techniques can address these challenges . 23 CSCW ’22 , Virtual Shaikh et al . 8 . 3 On Digitization’s Generational Usability Challenges One implication for our work concerns usability and digitization across age groups . Because of the COVID - 19 pandemic , some businesses were forced to digitize regardless of usability issues . In these situations , usability problems for customers did not simply disappear ; small businesses used a range of techniques to mitigate these issues . One specific usability concern—raised by both our interviewees and survey respondents—relates to trust and safety . Trust and Safety . For customers , this meant adapting to potentially foreign and “untrustworthy” payment methods when businesses decided to go online . Even before the onset of COVID - 19 , Vines et al . [ 89 ] highlights how older users were negatively affected by the deprecation of cheques in Britain . From our survey , we find that forced digitization may also result in older customers being apprehensive or left behind . We also find that some businesses highlight customers’ distrust of digital payments , exacerbated by the pandemic ; this finding also reinforces conclusions from Vines et al . [ 89 ] , Kaye et al . [ 41 ] , and Tam et al . [ 82 ] , who note general security and privacy concerns when moving documentation for personal finances online . Importantly , trust concerns may signal towards a wider mismatch between values of digitization strategies and older users [ 43 ] . From our findings , we worry that these concerns have been realized at a larger scale ; in the context of our work , the speed at which businesses moved their operations online alienated users who may have preferred traditional payment mediums . We also suspect that some of these effects are also reflected in Japan’s digitization rates . Compared to the remaining countries studied in this work , Japan’s small business population is significantly older [ 1 ] , and may be averse to digitization . Despite these concerns , interviewed small businesses highlighted shifting norms and experimenting with different digital payment techniques as potential solutions . Implications : Bridging the Usability Gap . In our survey and interviews , businesses mentioned increasing efforts aimed towards educating older users , following their shifts online . Although di - rectly educating users is a potential solution , businesses also utilized diverse digitization techniques to address trust and safety concerns . One shifting payment norm , highlighted in our qualitative analysis ( RQ1 ) , is increased gifting from online stores . Instead of directly purchasing goods or services from an online store , individuals can purchase these items on behalf of others through gifting . Businesses discussed using these digitization techniques to bridge usability gaps across generations . Specifically , younger and more technologically savvy individuals would order / gift items on behalf of older relatives . Gifting , however , fully removes an individual from a payment transaction loop . To address this , businesses also highlighted the usefulness of online appointments . Older individuals who were hesitant to input information online have the option to schedule a visit , then pay in person . These hybrid interactions may serve as a bridge between fully online payments popularized during COVID - 19 , and traditional in - person interactions that older individuals are more familiar with . Beyond trust and safety implications , emphasizing hybrid digital / physical payment techniques may help customers meet directly with staff , facilitating interpersonal interactions . Enumerating design challenges for older users is an active research area . Coleman et al . [ 24 ] and Lindsay et al . [ 46 ] , for example , highlight how participatory design sessions can inspire features that engage older individuals . Similarly , these techniques can be extended to online businesses . 8 . 4 Facilitating Interpersonal Interactions with Digitized Small Businesses A key issue raised by interviewed and surveyed businesses is the lack of interpersonal interactions between customers and business staff when digitizing payments . Though interpersonal interactions are core to the usability of payments for older individuals , businesses still highlighted a lack of 24 Online Payments During the COVID - 19 Pandemic CSCW ’22 , Virtual interaction , intrinsic to building loyalty and offering personalization to customers . Online stores might have the potential to increase the range of customers visiting a businesses ; these weaker ties are undeniably useful , especially for career related support [ 32 ] . However , building stronger ties 4 —through close relationships between customers and business owners—is a potential challenge . Implications Raised by Small Businesses . Through interviews and surveys , we’ve gleaned po - tential solutions towards facilitating interactions with staff . Businesses highlighted options like digital podcasts created by staff , or interactive catalogs that allowed users to digitally “visit” their physical stores . A key design distinction raised by these businesses—in the context of generational usability—is an emphasis on the interactions with customers and the business itself . For example , gifting might allow older individuals to continue purchasing items from digitized businesses ; how - ever , these individuals are detached from personalization offered by staff . Although businesses are experimenting with solutions that increase staff - customer interpersonal interactions , these solutions are still in their infancy . Because businesses moved online with unprecedented scale and speed , future research on payment technology systems should continue towards observing and facilitating interactions between staff and customers—especially due to their widespread reduction caused by COVID - 19 . For example , integrating digital conversational agents [ 42 ] that cater to cus - tomer personalities [ 93 , 94 ] may provide some personalization lost through physical interpersonal interactions . We suspect that business owners may have had “strong ties” with customers before the onset of the COVID - 19 pandemic ; these ties were threatened upon digitization . This might explain why hybrid interactions are seeing some success ; maintaining strong ties relies on a diverse range of communication channels [ 16 , 35 ] . Identifying methods to build and maintain strong ties for small businesses ( beyond early - stage hybrid interactions ) is an avenue for future work . 8 . 5 Digitization and Usability Across Business Sectors In contrast to prior work , we also focus on potential usability issues from businesses across different sectors in the United States . To summarize RQ3 , while all 50 states in the United States saw significant increases in digitization for Food and Drink sectors , only 18 saw significant increases in online payment methods for Home and Repair sectors . From our surveys , we noticed that service - oriented sectors may have struggled to digitize compared to businesses that sold goods . In one case , we interviewed a business ( P4 ) that pivoted from a service - oriented nature , to one focused on goods . In contrast , one service - oriented sector—Health Care and Fitness—continued to perform better than we expected . From RQ3 ( Section 7 ) , we found that Health Care and Fitness saw 47 states with significant increases . In these states , the average relative increase in digitization neared 90 % , significantly higher than professional / home - repair services ( Table 7 ) . Furthermore , survey respondents noticed that telehealth usage increased over the duration of the COVID - 19 pandemic . Implications : Learning from Health Care & Fitness’ Relative Success . We suspect that the ex - ceptional increases in Health Care , compared to other service - oriented sectors , are due to its amenability to digitization . Telemedicine and eHealth related technologies ( subcategories of health - care and fitness ) are generally cost - effective to adopt , having minimal infrastructure requirements ; furthermore , providing digital offerings improves usability for customers who cannot afford the cost of health care delivery [ 25 ] . In contrast , Home and Repair services did not need to digitize due to the hands - on nature of their sector ; since people are staying at home due to the pandemic , performing home and repair services on your own might simply be more accessible ( instead of risking a COVID - 19 infection ) . 4 Granovetter [ 32 ] broadly defines “strong ties” as relationships where individuals can directly relay immediate trust and support—through some form of bonding social capital [ 17 ] —to eachother . 25 CSCW ’22 , Virtual Shaikh et al . Interestingly , Bhat et al . [ 15 ] reports the presence and shift in the dynamics of digitized inter - personal interactions between patient - doctors in the Global South during COVID - 19 . In our work , interviewed / surveyed service businesses either notice no change in payment dynamics , or pivot entirely to a sector where interpersonal interactions are not as critical ( e . g . P4 moving from a Mak - erspace to Retail ) . Unlike with goods - oriented businesses , maintaining interpersonal interactions between staff and customer are core to accessing the service itself—extending beyond building loyalty or offering personalization . Identifying how service oriented sectors beyond telehealth might incorporate interpersonal interactions is an important design implication for digital payment infrastructure . Findings from transitioning physical courses online [ 12 ] can potentially be applied to sectors that are currently difficult to digitize ( Home & Repair ) , though future work is necessary . 8 . 6 Implications for Low Income Communities Rapid digitization does have its risks . For example , although digitized telehealth services have the potential to provide specialized medical knowledge to rural areas [ 56 , 79 ] , these services are sometimes affected by availability issues and technical difficulties [ 23 ] . Availability issues might be exacerbated in low - income communities that do not have reliable access to the internet . Furthermore , a significant proportion of low - income individuals are unbanked , relying on cash - based transactions [ 68 ] . By transitioning to digitized services , businesses are potentially becoming unusable to these individuals . The significant scale of international digitization observed in our work emphasizes these risks . Continuing to accept cash—or designing accessible financial systems that empower unbanked communities to interact with digital payment infrastructure—is critical to ensuring access as more businesses move online . 8 . 7 Future Work Understanding Customer Preferences . An avenue for future work involves understanding if cus - tomers prefer digital or physical sales in regions where businesses have reopened safely . Our work highlights the proportion of businesses that utilize digital techniques to remain open , not customers . Although we suspect that continued digitization of sellers might indicate a consumer preference for digital payments , more work needs to be conducted in this area . As regions approach normalcy , understanding if customers continue preferring digitization in these regions will shed light on changing payment mediums after the pandemic . Understanding the Use of Different Digitization Strategies . In this work , we group all digitization techniques together and do not differentiate between , for example , online menus and delivery services . However , we found that the adoption of digitization techniques overall might be dependent on a variety of different factors ; therefore , understanding where and why specific techniques were successful is important avenue for future work . Because social factors appear to influence digitization , different digitization strategies may be amenable to different pre - existing social norms . Permanence of Digital Payments . Because our preliminary survey respondents indicated that they already had digitization infrastructure in place , we initially suspected that the initial wave of digitization in March and April of 2020 had been driven by businesses that were already on the verge of digitizing anyway . However , we would have expected the rate of digitization to have slowed or decreased from the pre - COVID - 19 level . Qualitatively , however , after a small bit of pullback immediately in the months after March and April , the rate of digitizations appears to have largely resumed its gradual rise—well ahead of where it would have been without the pandemic . Although our survey findings indicate that businesses will continue using adopted digital techniques beyond the pandemic , understanding if / how these sentiments change deserves further attention . 26 Online Payments During the COVID - 19 Pandemic CSCW ’22 , Virtual 8 . 8 Limitations Analysing Policy Variations Beyond the US . Collecting fine - grained policy level data while con - trolling for federal regulations is a significant , resource intensive challenge . We were able to find a comprehensive dataset for subnational interventions and corresponding data on small businesses in only the United States . Other policy datasets were at a national level , or incomplete . Furthermore , as seen in Figure 1 , a majority of small businesses in our dataset were located within the United States ; separating users into subnational segments from under - covered countries was prohibitive . If these datasets are collected , future work can address these limitations by analyzing how these policies affected digitization , similar to Section 7 . 2 . Finer - Grained Policy Responses in the United States . One limitation of our work is the use of state - level regulations as a proxy for overall government response . However , some city - level responses vary significantly from state - level regulations , affecting digitization in these subregions . Potential future work might take a closer look at a specific set of cities or regions where policy interventions are accessible at a finer resolution . Understanding how different interventions affected digitization in geographically close regions may shed more light on what makes an intervention successful . Focusing on Businesses That Closed . Our work focuses on a sample of businesses that remained open throughout the pandemic . Looking at the adoption of digital payment techniques for busi - nesses that have closed permanently may potentially raise a different set of usability and adoption challenges . Identifying these challenges might inspire solutions that help potentially closing busi - nesses remain open . Furthermore , identifying discrepancies between strategies adopted by closed and open businesses may help inform struggling businesses . Observational Study . Finally , although we adopt a quasi - experimental setup and include control variables in our models , our study is still observational ; we cannot claim that COVID - 19 directly caused any of the phenomena documented in our work . However , we carefully considered and included control variables that accounted for temporal and geographic trends , making our work stronger than a purely correlational study .
