A R T I C L E S NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 5 | NUMBER 8 | AUGUST 2003 711 Differing modes of tumour cell invasion have distinct requirements for Rho / ROCK signalling and extracellular proteolysis Erik Sahai 1 and Christopher J . Marshall 1 , 2 Rho family GTPases regulate the cytoskeleton and cell migration and are frequently overexpressed in tumours . Here , we identify two modes of tumour - cell motility in 3D matrices that involve different usage of Rho signalling . Rho signalling through ROCK promotes a rounded bleb - associated mode of motility that does not require pericellular proteolysis . This form of motility requires ezrin , which is localized in the direction of cell movement . In contrast , elongated cell motility is associated with Rac - dependent F - actin - rich protrusions and does not require Rho , ROCK or ezrin function . Combined blockade of extracellular proteases and ROCK negates the ability of tumour cells to switch between modes of motility and synergises to prevent tumour cell invasion . To metastasize , tumour cells must cross tissue boundaries . This requires increased cell motility driven by remodelling of the cytoskele - ton and cell contacts with the extracellular matrix 1 . The Rho family of small GTPases , of which the best studied members are Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA 2 , are key regulators of both cell adhesion and the cytoskele - ton . When bound to GTP , these proteins recruit a range of target pro - teins that regulate the cytoskeleton . Rac1 promotes the formation of large membrane protrusions called lamellipodia that drive the motil - ity of many cell types 3 . Active RhoA and RhoC can recruit the ROCK ( also known as Rho kinase ) family of kinases that phosphorylate a range of cytoskeletal proteins , thereby promoting the formation of actin stress fibres and the generation of contractile force 4 , 5 . ROCK also phosphorylates the ezrin / radixin / moesin - family proteins that link the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane 6 ; consistently , the localiza - tion of ezrin is dependent on Rho activity 7 . Cdc42 signalling promotes the formation of actin - rich microspikes , which sense chemotactic gra - dients , and orientates the microtubule - organizing centre ( MTOC ) and Golgi apparatus during polarized cell movements 2 . There is increasing evidence that Rho proteins become deregulated by overex - pression in tumours , and in some cases this correlates with progres - sion of the disease 8 – 10 . Furthermore , increased expression of RhoC is required for the experimental metastasis of A375 melanoma cells 11 . Although it is probable that aberrant regulation of Rho proteins contributes to metastasis by promoting cell motility , little is known about the function of Rho in cells moving in a 3D environment similar to that found in tumours . To delineate the roles of Rho family proteins in tumour cell motility and invasion , we have investigated how tumour cells migrate through a 3D matrix . Strikingly , we find a corre - lation between the way cells migrate and their sensitivity to inhibition of Rho or ROCK function .

Tumour cells can over - come inhibitors that target a particular mode of motility by switching to a different mode . However , we find that a combination of inhibitors which interferes with both modes of motility results in a synergistic decrease in tumour cell invasion . RESULTSDistinct modes of motility have different requirements for Rho and ROCK activity The ability of five cell lines to invade into Matrigel ( a matrix consisting of collagen IV , laminin and some growth factors 12 ; see Methods ) was determined in the presence of either TAT - C3 ( ref . 13 ) , which inacti - vates RhoA , RhoB and RhoC , or Y27632 ( ref . 14 ) , which inhibits ROCKI and ROCKII ( details of the cell lines are given in Table 1 ) . Inhibition of either Rho or ROCK almost completely blocked the inva - sion of A375m2 and LS174T cells and significantly reduced the inva - sion of WM266 . 4 cells . In contrast , BE cells were unaffected by Y27632 treatment and only moderately inhibited by TAT - C3 , whereas neither treatment affected the invasion of SW962 cells . Simultaneous blockade of both Rho and ROCK function had a similar effect to inhibition of Rho alone , confirming that Y27632 and TAT - C3 are effectively inhibit - ing the same pathway . Table 2 shows the relative proportion of cells invading to different depths . There is no overall correlation between the requirement for Rho or ROCK for cell invasion and the depth to which cells invade . While analysing these experiments , we observed that the different cell lines had strikingly different morphologies when moving through the Matrigel . To investigate this further , we plated cells in serum - free media on top of a thick ( 500 – 1000 - µ m ) layer of Matrigel . After 24 – 36 h , the tumour cells that had migrated into Matrigel were imaged using confocal microscopy and their 3D morphology was reconstructed . BE and SW962 cells were elongated , with numerous small F - actin - rich spikes ( Fig . 1a ) . In contrast , LS174T and A375m2 cells were very rounded , with localized patches rich in F - actin and small membrane blebs ( Fig . 1a , arrows ) . Occasionally , we observed several cells invading the Matrigel together as large rounded aggregates ( data not shown ) . The rounded morphology of A375m2 and LS174T cells was also observed in cells on top of the Matrigel , but contrasted sharply with their more elongated morphology on a rigid 2D substrate coated with a thin layer ( 10 – 20 µ m ) of Matrigel ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . A thin layer of Matrigel is much more rigid than a thick layer because it is closely associated with the inflexible plastic . These data suggest that a pliable extracellular matrix favours a rounded tumour cell morphology . The formation of membrane blebs in A375m2 cells was not affected by treatment with 50 µ M zVAD - fmk , which prevents apoptosis by blocking caspase activity , demonstrating that the mem - brane blebs were not an indication of apoptosis ( data not shown ) . In contrast to the other cell lines we studied , cultures of WM266 . 4 exhib - ited a mixed morphology . Approximately 60 % of WM266 . 4 cells had a rounded morphology with occasional membrane blebs , whereas the rest had an elongated morphology with F - actin - rich protrusions ( Fig . 1a ) . Significantly , both elongated and rounded WM266 . 4 could invade Matrigel and moved similar distances . However , after blockade of Rho or ROCK function , only elongated cells were able to invade ( data not shown and see Fig . 5 ) . The mixed morphologies observed in WM266 . 4 cells were not a result of the cell line being a mixed popula - tion , because single - cell clones derived from the parental WM266 . 4 cells also exhibited both morphologies ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1b ) . Similar morphologies were observed in cells invading collagen I matrices and growth - factor - reduced Matrigel , indicating that the morphology of the cells observed is primarily the result of the 3D environment and not growth factors contained in matrix ( data not shown ) . Indeed , our attempts to switch the morphol - ogy of these cells in Matrigel by using different growth factors ( for example , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , platelet - derived growth fac - tor ( PDGF ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) ) were unsuc - cessful ( data not shown ) . These results demonstrate a direct correlation between the cell lines whose invasion is blocked by inhibi - tion of Rho or ROCK signalling and cells that move with a rounded bleb - associated morphology ( Table 1 ) . To determine if the different cell morphologies observed in cells invading Matrigel were seen in an in vivo tumour environment , we used derivatives of the cell lines expressing green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) . Pools of BE or A375m2 cells in which 20 – 30 % of the cells expressed GFP were grown as sub - cutaneous tumours in nude mice . Once the tumours reached 1 cm diameter they were excised , fixed and then imaged without physical sectioning . Optical sectioning by confo - cal microscopy followed by 3D reconstruction of the cell morphology revealed that similar to our in vitro observations , BE cells had an elon - gated shape with many elongated protrusions ( Fig . 1b ) . In contrast , A375m2 cells were often rounded and had bleb - like structures ( Fig . 1b ) . We also co - stained the tumour samples for active caspase - 3 ( ref . 15 ) , which is present only in apoptotic cells . The cells with mem - brane blebs were clearly negative for active caspase - 3 ( Fig . 1b ) , indicat - ing that they were not apoptotic . Similar results were also obtained with LS174T cells ( data not shown ) . These data demonstrate that dif - ferent tumour cell morphologies observed are not an in vitro artefact , but reflect different tumour cell morphologies found in vivo . RhoA and ROCK signalling promote rounded cell motility Next , we investigated the effect of modulating Rho or ROCK signalling on the morphology of A375m2 and BE cells in a 3D environment . These cell lines were chosen because they have striking rounded and elongated morphologies , respectively , and are easily transfected . Treatment of A375m2 cells with TAT - C3 or Y27632 resulted in a loss of bleb - like structures and in some cases promoted the formation of membrane protrusions ( Fig . 2a , middle ) , suggesting that the rounded morphology and blebs are dependent on Rho or ROCK function . Similar results were obtained in LS174T cells ( data not shown ) , although treatment of BE cells with either TAT - C3 or Y27632 did not affect the formation of elongated actin - rich protrusions ( Fig . 2a , bot - tom ) . To investigate the effect of activating Rho or ROCK signalling we used parental non - metastatic A375 cells ( A375p ) 11 . These cells have a less rounded morphology with fewer blebs than the metastatic A375m2 cells ( Fig . 2a , top ) , indicating that there is a correlation between rounded cell morphology and metastatic potential . Overexpression of RhoC , which promotes the invasion of these cells in vitro and their ability to metastasize in vivo 11 , or constitutively active RhoA G14V promoted a rounded morphology in A375p cells ( Fig . 2a , top ) . In addition , this was prevented by Y27632 treatment ( Fig . 2a , top ) , suggesting that ROCK functions downstream of Rho . Consistently , expression of an active ROCKI mutant ( ROCK - ∆ 3 ) resulted in a rounded cell morphology with large numbers of mem - brane blebs ( Fig . 2a , top ) . These data demonstrate that Rho – ROCK signalling is necessary for a round morphology with bleb - like struc - tures and that activation of Rho – ROCK signalling promotes this mor - phology and antagonizes the formation of elongated protrusions . Blockade of Rac1 function through expression of the constitutively GDP - bound Rac mutant , Rac1 T17N , had little effect on the rounded morphology of A375m2 cells but inhibited the formation of elongated © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup A R T I C L E S NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 5 | NUMBER 8 | AUGUST 2003 715 cell protrusions in BE and WM266 . 4 cells ( Fig . 2a and data not shown ) . Indeed , the invasion of all three cell lines was reduced by expression of Rac1 T17N ( data not shown ) . As elongated protrusive movement does not require Rho or ROCK signalling , whereas rounded blebbing movement requires this path - way , we investigated whether these different requirements for Rho – ROCK signalling were reflected in the levels of RhoA activation . Pull - down assays that capture only the active GTP - bound form of RhoA 11 were used to compare RhoA activity between the two melanoma and two colon carcinoma cell lines with different modes of motility . We found that LS174T and A375m2 cells , which have a rounded morphology , have high levels of RhoA activity when com - pared with BE and WM266 . 4 cells , which exhibit either a completely or partially elongated morphology ( Fig . 2b ) . We then tested if increasing the level of Rho - ROCK signalling in cells with elongated morphology would change their morphology and allow them to move in a rounded blebbing fashion . Transfection of BE or WM266 . 4 cells with either RhoA G14V or ROCK - ∆ 3 resulted in loss of the elongated polarized morphology ( Fig . 2c and data not shown ) . The effect of overexpressing RhoA G14V was blocked by Y27632 treatment , indicating that ROCK is required downstream of Rho to promote a rounded cell morphology . A similar proportion of cells transfected with RhoA G14V or ROCK - ∆ 3 were invasive , compared with control cells ( Fig . 2c , d ) , although the depth to which cells transfected with ROCK - ∆ 3 invaded was slightly reduced ( data not shown ) . In contrast , activation of Rho signalling in BE cells in a 2D environment completely inhibits their motility 16 . These results demonstrate that cell - intrinsic factors , such as the activ - ity of RhoA or ROCK , influence the mechanism of cell motility through a 3D matrix . Analysis of rounded cell movement To visualize cells migrating in a 3D matrix , we performed time - lapse confocal microscopy on A375m2 cells expressing GFP . A375m2 cells moved without elongated protrusions but had many bleb - like struc - tures that were very rapidly remodelled ( Fig . 3a and see Supplementary Information , Movie 1 ) . Not all the cells were motile in the time - lapse studies : this is probably caused by the lack of chemo - attractant gradient once the cells have entered the Matrigel and the rel - atively short time period of analysis . Time - lapse analysis over a longer time demonstrated that even during translation of cell movement , A375m2 cells maintain a rounded morphology ( Fig . 3b and see Supplementary Information , Movie 2 ) . During translation we esti - mated that the cell speed was ~ 5 µ m h − 1 ; however , over longer periods of time the net speed was ~ 2 µ m h − 1 . The motility of A375m2 cells in a 3D matrix contrasted sharply with their behaviour on a 2D substrate ; furthermore , their motility on a 2D substrate was not blocked by Y27632 treatment ( see Supplementary Information , Movies 3 and 4 ) .

Therefore , we investigated if particular molecules and cellular structures were orientated in the direction of cell movement . Previous studies have shown that cells moving in an elongated ‘mesenchymal’ manner adopt a polarized morphology towards the chemoattractant . In particular , the Golgi apparatus and MTOC are orientated towards the front of the cell 2 and phosphatidyli - nositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PtdInsP 3 ) is produced in lamellipodia at the leading edge of cell 17 , 18 . Preliminary analysis showed that A375m2 cells begin to enter Matrigel after 6 – 12 h , whereas BE cells take 12 – 24 h ( data not shown ) . Therefore , we analysed the distribution of these components 8 h after plating A375m2 cells on Matrigel and 16 h after plating BE cells . To visualize the Golgi apparatus , we used an antibody to the Golgi protein β - coatomer 19 . This revealed that the Golgi appara - tus was orientated in the direction of movement in BE cells , but not in A375m2 cells ( Fig . 4a ) . The pleckstrin - homology ( PH ) domain of protein kinase B ( PKB ) / Akt , which binds PtdInsP 3 , was fused to GFP and used to localize PtdInsP 3 within the cell . In agreement with previ - ous results , we found that the PH domain of PKB localized to the ends of cell protrusions and sites of cell – cell contact in BE cells ( Fig . 4a ) 17 .

These results suggest that cells moving with a rounded morphology are not polarized in the direction of movement in the same way as cells with an elongated morphology . RhoA – ROCK signalling promotes the formation of large focal com - plexes containing integrins , paxillin and vinculin 2 , and the influences the distribution of ezrin in cells cultured in a 2D environment 7 . Therefore , we investigated the localization of these proteins in cells entering Matrigel . Integrin β 1 was localized to patches all over the sur - face of A375m2 cells ( Fig . 4a ) . In addition , it was localized to bleb - like structures orientated towards the Matrigel in approximately 30 % of invading cells ( Fig . 4a , yellow arrowhead ; cells are invading Matrigel in an upwards direction ) . Inhibition of Rho or ROCK signalling did not affect the localization of integrin β 1 to the cell surface in A375m2 cells ; however , it was not found in blebs , as these were no longer formed . Integrin β 1 was distributed throughout the cell surface in BE cells ( Fig . 4a ) . Interestingly , in A375m2 cells , the focal adhesion protein paxillin was more uniformly distributed and not specifically localized with integrin β 1 or in membrane blebs ( Fig . 4a ) . The distribution of ezrin in A375m2 cells was highly asymmetric , with the majority con - centrated in one or two discrete patches in 52 % of control cells ( Fig . 4a , yellow arrowhead ) but in less than 10 % of TAT - C3 - or Y27632 - treated cells . These patches of localized ezrin were orientated towards the Matrigel into which the cells were invading ( Fig . 4a ) . In contrast , ezrin was localized around the main body of BE cells and not in the protrusions orientated in the direction of movement . We next tested if interfering with ezrin function affected the ability of A375m2 cells to invade Matrigel . Cells were transfected with an ezrin truncation construct ( residues 1 – 310 ) that has previously been shown to interfere with the function of endogenous ERM proteins 20 . A375m2 cells trans - fected with ezrin 1 – 310 had a reduced ability to invade Matrigel when compared with control cells ( Fig . 4B ) ; however transfection of BE cells with ezrin 1 – 310 had no effect . Interference with integrin β 1 function inhibited the motility of all cell lines tested ( data not shown ) . These results demonstrate that in rounded cell motility , ezrin is localized in the direction of cell movement in a Rho - and ROCK - dependent man - ner and is required for cell movement . Rounded motility does not require pericellular proteolysis It was recently demonstrated that amoeboid tumour cell motility can occur even after inhibition of extracellular proteases , including matrix metalloproteases ( MMPs ) 21 . To test if the rounded form of motility we observe requires extracellular proteases , we performed cell invasion assays in the presence of a cocktail of protease inhibitors : GM6001 ( MMP inhibitor ) , leupeptin ( serine and cysteine protease inhibitor ) , aprotinin ( serine protease inhibitor ) and calpeptin ( calpain inhibitor ) . We found that these inhibitors did not affect cell viability . The ability of LS174T and A375m2 cells to invade Matrigel was slightly increased by the addition of protease inhibitors ( Table 3 ) .

The switch to a rounded mode of motility suggested that the sensitivity of these cell lines to inhibition of ROCK would be increased in the presence of protease inhibitors . To test this , we combined treatment with Y27632 and protease inhibitors . The combination of protease inhibitors with Y27632 markedly reduced the invasion of BE and WM266 . 4 cells . This reduction was sig - nificantly greater than that caused by Y27632 alone ( Table 3 ) . The invasive capacity of SW962 was reduced by protease inhibitors ( Table 3 ) and was further diminished by addition of Y27632 , whereas Y27632 alone had little effect . Taken together , these results demonstrate that when pericellular proteolysis is blocked some tumour cells switch to a rounded mode of motility that requires ROCK function . DISCUSSION In this study , we distinguish modes of cell motility through 3D matri - ces by their requirement for Rho – ROCK signalling . Rounded blebbing movement requires Rho – ROCK signalling , whereas elongated protru - sive movement does not . Furthermore , the morphologies of cells growing in vivo in a tumour are consistent with these different modes of motility . Rounded tumour cell motility is associated with small bleb - like protrusions ; these blebs are similar to those observed during apoptosis , indeed apoptotic membrane blebs are also dependent upon ROCK function 13 . We hypothesize that contractile force generated by Rho – ROCK signalling generates hydrostatic pressure , generating bleb - like protrusions in all directions . In contrast to elongated motility , the Golgi apparatus is not orientated in the direction of motility during rounded cell movement . Directionality of movement arises because contacts with the extracellular matrix are made more efficiently in a particular direction , possibly through localized concentrations of chemoattractants . These contacts may function as anchors to enable the translation of cell movement in this direction . In support of this model , we find molecules involved in connecting the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix , such as integrin β 1 and ezrin , are concentrated in the direction of movement . Ezrin may link cell – matrix contacts made to the actin cytoskeleton . The absence of vinculin and paxillin from membrane blebs suggests that the kinds of adhesive complexes formed are distinct from focal adhesions observed on 2D substrates 21 . The rounded motility we observed has similarities to the amoeboid movement of HT1080 tumour cells previously reported 22 : both lack obvious pseudopods and do not require extracellular proteases . Our studies with HT1080 cells confirmed that their invasion does not require extracellular proteases and we found that they are markedly inhibited by blockade of Rho or ROCK function . These findings are consistent with our observations that motility driven by Rho or ROCK does not require extracellular proteolysis . We speculate that the actin contractile ring observed during amoeboid movement may be regu - lated by ROCK and hence that amoeboid tumour cell movement may be sensitive to Y27632 treatment . The elongated mechanism of motil - ity used by BE and SW962 cells is probably the same as that used by mesenchymal cells and most likely predominates in carcinomas that undergo an epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition 23 . The elongated F - actin - rich structures we observe are very similar to previously described Src - and FAK - dependent invadopodia 24 . We propose that Rho – ROCK signalling promotes metastasis by favouring rounded blebbing - associated motility of tumour cells . This hypothesis is supported by the following observations : metastatic A375m2 cells that overexpress RhoC 11 show increased numbers of membrane blebs when compared with the non - metastatic parental cells . Thus , there is a correlation between rounded motility and metastatic potential . A study of metastatic mammary carcinoma cells noted increased linear translational movement of rounded cells lack - ing any extended protrusions in vivo 25 . These cells express elevated levels of ROCKII , compared with non - metastatic controls 26 . Consistently , other studies have shown that inhibition of ROCK reduces the invasive behaviour of tumour cells in vivo 27 , 28 , most prob - ably through a reduction in rounded tumour cell movement . Therefore , therapies that target Rho or ROCK function are likely to be most effective at preventing the invasive behaviour of tumour cells that use rounded motility . We are investigating whether there are his - tological markers that may reflect the mode of cell motility used by a tumour and potentially its sensitivity to inhibition of RhoA or ROCK signalling . The ability of tumour cells to switch between modes of motility may limit the effectiveness of agents aimed at reducing the invasion of tumour cells . Inhibition of Rho or ROCK function is not effective against cells moving with an elongated morphology and may result in selection for cells that use this mode of motility . Conversely , inhibition of extracellular proteases does not affect tumour cells moving with rounded cell morphology and causes elongated cells to switch to this mode of movement . This may account for the limited efficacy of MMP inhibitors in clinical trials 29 . Simultaneous inhibition of both modes of motility markedly reduces tumour cell invasion in vitro and we hypothesize that combining agents which target Rho – ROCK function and extracellular proteases may be an effective strategy in vivo 30 . METHODS Cell culture , transfection and plasmids . BE , LS174T , SW962 and WM266 . 4 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection . A375P and A375m2 cells were a gift from R . Hynes ( Howard Hughes Medical Institute , MIT ) . Cells were routinely maintained in DMEM containing 10 % donor calf serum . Transfections were performed using Fugene 6 ( 1 815 091 ; Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) . Briefly , cells were seeded at 50 % confluency in 6 - well plates 16 h before transfection . Immediately before transfection , cells were transferred into OptiMEM ( 31985 - 047 ; Invitrogen , Paisley , UK ) . DNA ( 1 µ g ) was mixed with 100 µ l OptiMEM and 6 µ l Fugene 6 15 min before addition of the mix to the cells for 6 h . Y27632 ( Tocris , Avonmouth , UK ) was used at 10 µ M ; TAT - C3 ( described in ref . 13 ) was used at 500 nM ; GM6001 ( # 364205 ; Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) was used at 20 µ M ; calpeptin ( # PI - 101 ; Plymouth Meeting , Biomol ) was used at 10 µ M ; aprotinin ( # A3428 ; Sigma , Poole , UK ) was used at 10 µ g ml − 1 ; leupeptin ( # L2884 ; Sigma ) was used at 10 µ g ml − 1 . Elongation fac - tor 1 α ( EF ) promoter - driven - RhoA G14V and EF - Rac1 T17N are described 31 ; EF - RhoC is described 32 ; pCAGG - ROCK - ∆ 3 is described 33 ; EGFP - N1 is from Clontech ( Basingstoke , UK ) ; EGFP - N1 – ezrin 1 – 310 is gift from R . Lamb ( Institute of Cancer Research , London , UK ) and EGFP – Akt - PH domain is a gift from J . Downward ( Cancer Research UK , London ) 17 . Pull - down assays to analyse RhoA activity were performed as described 34 . Matrigel assays . For qualitative analysis , a layer of Matrigel containing growth factors ( 1 ng ml − 1 EGF , 15 ng ml − 1 IGF - 1 , 12 pg ml − 1 PDGF and 2 . 3 ng ml − 1 transforming growth factor β ( # 356230 ; BD Biosciences , Oxford , UK ) was pre - pared on a normal tissue - culture dish . Routinely , the thickness of the layer was 500 – 1000 µ m . Cells were then plated on top of the Matrigel in serum - free DMEM . After 6 – 8 h or 24 – 36 h , cells were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde / PBS and the cells that had invaded the Matrigel were analysed by indirect immunofluo - rescence microscopy using a Bio - Rad MRC1024 confocal microscope ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) . For quantitative assays , 100 µ l of Matrigel lacking growth factors was prepared in a Transwell ( # 3422 ; Costar ) with 8 - µ m pores . After 24 h of transfection or TAT - C3 treatment , or after 2 h ofY27632 treatment , approx - imately 30 , 000 cells were seeded on the opposite side of the Transwell from the Matrigel . The cells were allowed to adhere for 4 h before filling the lower cham - ber of the Transwell dish ( which contain the cells ) with serum - free DMEM and the upper chamber with 10 % DCS / DMEM , except for LS174T cells when 1 % DCS / DMEM was used . Tris - buffered saline was used as a vehicle control for © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup A R T I C L E S NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 5 | NUMBER 8 | AUGUST 2003 719 TAT - C3 treatment and Y27632 was re - added after approximately 36 h . After 3 days , the cells were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde / PBS and stained with propidium iodide to label nucleic acids . By taking optical sections with a Bio - Rad MRC1024 confocal microscope , the proportion of cells that had invaded spe - cific distances into the Matrigel was determined . For time - lapse microscopy , the cells were prepared in a similar manner to that used for qualitative analysis , except that MatTek ( Ashland , MA ) glass - bottomed dishes were used . These were then inverted and placed on a Tokai Hit heated stage for time - lapse confo - cal microscopy . Immunofluorescence microscopy . After fixation , cells were permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 / PBS , washed three times with PBS and incubated with Texas - Red – Phalloidin ( # T17471 , used at 1 : 100 ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) and ToPro3 ( # T3605 ; Molecular Probes ) for 1 h before three further washes PBS and mounting . For cells or tumour samples that were stained with anti - bodies , the procedure was essentially as above , except that a primary antibody was used in place of phalloidin and a further step was added to allow subse - quent incubation with secondary antibodies . Primary antibodies were as fol - lows : Active caspase 3 ( # 9661S ; Cell Signalling , Beverly , MA ) , ezrin ( # 610603 ; BD Bioscience ) , paxillin ( # P13520 ; Transduction Labs ) , integrin β 1 ( # sc - 13590 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , cortactin ( UBC7901 - 80 ; Europa Bioproducts ) . Secondary antibodies were from Jackson Stratech . Xenografts . 10 6 tumour cells were injected sub - cutaneously into the flank of male MF1 nude mice . Tumours were removed when they were approximately 1 cm in diameter and then fixed in 4 % Formaldehyde / PBS . The tumour was then cut into small pieces ( roughly 1 - mm cubes ) and imaging and indirect immuno - fluorescence microscopy was performed . For confocal microscopy analysis , sam - ples were placed under a coverslip for analysis with an oil immersion objective .
