One statistic from this category , which we refer to as motif - role fingerprints , differs from global subgraph counts in that the number of subgraphs in which each node participates is counted . As with global subgraph counts , it can be important to distinguish between motif - role fingerprints that are ‘structural’ ( induced subgraphs ) and ‘functional’ ( partial subgraphs ) . Here we show mathematically that a vector of all functional motif - role fingerprints can readily be obtained from an arbitrary directed adjacency matrix , and then converted to structural motif - role fingerprints by multiplying that vector by a specific invertible conversion matrix . This result demonstrates that a unique structural motif - role fingerprint exists for any given functional motif - role fingerprint . We demonstrate a similar result for the cases of functional and structural motif - fingerprints without node roles , and global subgraph counts that form the basis of standard motif analysis . We also explicitly highlight that motif - role fingerprints are elemental to several popular metrics for quantifying the subgraph structure of directed complex networks , including motif distributions , directed clustering coefficient , and transitivity . The relationships between each of these metrics and motif - role fingerprints also suggest new subtypes of directed clustering coefficients and transitivities . Our results have potential utility in analyzing directed synaptic networks constructed from neuronal connectome data , such as in terms of centrality . Other potential applications include anomaly detection in networks , identification of similar networks and identification of similar nodes within networks .

Introduction Complex relational systems from different domains , such as biology , sociology or economics , can be systematically analyzed using their network representations . A network ( also known as a graph ) is composed of nodes and edges , where nodes represent the entities in the system and edges represent the relationships between these entities . Depending on the type of represented relations , the node pairs that form the edges can have a certain ordering , in which case the resulting network is called directed . For example , in networks of biological neurons and synapses ( also known as neuronal connectomes [ 1 ] ) , the nodes correspond to individual neurons , while directed edges between the nodes ( typically ) represent the existence of chemical synapses that enable communications between neurons [ 2 ] . The wiring patterns of networks cast light on the functional mechanisms of the analyzed complex systems , and therefore , network structure analysis is gaining increasing interest from different disciplines . However , many network analysis problems are computationally intractable [ 3 ] . Therefore , the only available solutions are based on approximations to the exact solutions of these problems . Network properties that describe different wiring characteristics of networks are used for this purpose . For example , given two networks without any labeling on the nodes , the problem of finding all the node pairs that have identical wiring patterns in the two networks is a computationally intractable problem . However , this problem can be simplified by computing the degrees ( i . e . , the number of neighbors a node has ) of all nodes and using the degree statistics to compare the nodes . Even if the resulting matches are not guaranteed to have identical wiring patterns , these matches would extensively reduce the size of the search space . The search space can be reduced even further by computing other network properties that capture different types of interaction patterns ; e . g . , using the similarities of clustering coefficients that measure the tendency of nodes to form triangular interactions [ 4 ] . Different subgraphs of a network can be obtained from different subsets of its nodes and edges . Many of the network properties are indeed dependent on the subgraph properties of the networks ; e . g . , clustering coefficient is defined based on three - node subgraphs of a network in which all nodes are connected with each other forming a triangle . In a connected subgraph , all nodes are reachable from any of the other nodes in the subgraph . A subgraph is induced ( also known as node induced ) if it is enforced that all the edges between the chosen subset of nodes are included in the subgraph . The subgraphs that do not carry the induced property are called partial ( also known as edge induced ) subgraphs . For example , a 3 - node clique contains 3 different two - path subgraphs ( two - path subgraphs are those that Motif - Role - Fingerprints in Directed Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 December 8 , 2014 2 / 25 contain 3 nodes and 2 edges ) when partial subgraph properties are considered . However , such a graph does not contain any two - path subgraphs when induced subgraph properties are considered . Triangular patterns in networks are commonly utilized to analyze the network topology . In undirected networks , the clustering coefficient of a node is calculated by dividing the number of triangles around the node by the number of different pairs of its neighbors [ 5 ] . Average clustering coefficient explains the clustering ( triangulation ) within a network by averaging the clustering coefficients of all its nodes . Extension of clustering coefficient to directed networks is not trivial since there are two different types of triangular directed subgraphs ; one being a cyclic subgraph ( m 5 5 in Figs . 1 and 2 ) and the other being an acyclic subgraph ( m 5 9 in Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Based on the counts of the four distinct node roles on these two subgraphs ( i . e . , r ~ 11 , 14 , 17 and 18 in Figs . 1 and 2 ) , the definition of clustering coefficient has been extended to the directed case [ 4 , 6 ] . A different metric for quantifying network clustering known as transitivity is calculated by considering every possible combination of three nodes in a network , and counting how many of these triads are mutually connected by three edges , normalized by the number of triads with at least two edges [ 7 ] . It is similar to clustering coefficient but unlike that metric , it is not an average of local node - specific clustering . Transitivity is typically used for undirected networks rather than directed ones , but an expression for directed transitivity is given in [ 8 ] . Recent work on network properties use the statistics of all observable connected subgraph configurations as detailed descriptors of the wiring in networks [ 9 , 10 ] . Network motifs were originally defined as the partial subgraph patterns of a network that appears more frequently than expected from a ’null - hypothesis’ network model that preserve the input network’s degree distribution , or other statistical properties [ 9 , 11 – 15 ] . Network motifs are defined for both directed and undirected networks , covering all observable subgraphs patterns on sets of nodes ranging in dimension from 2 to n . Network motifs have been used to analyze network structures of a wide - range of networks , such as those of the neuronal connectome of C . elegans [ 16 – 20 ] . Practically , network motif analyses are performed with 3 - node subgraph patterns due to the high computational cost of null model generation step for larger subgraphs ; all directed 3 - node subgraph patterns are illustrated in Fig . 1 . Another group of network properties that are based on subgraph counts have been studied in the context of graphlets —these are small , connected , non - isomorphic and induced subgraphs of a large network [ 10 ] . There are three major differences between network motifs and graphlets : 1 . network motifs account for partial subgraphs while graphlets are based on induced subgraphs ; 2 . network motifs are dependent on a given null network model while graphlets are completely independent from any null hypotheses ; and 3 . graphlets are defined only for undirected graphs while network motifs are defined also for directed graphs . Motif - Role - Fingerprints in Directed Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 December 8 , 2014 3 / 25 The number of times that each graphlet appears in a network describes the network’s topology [ 10 ] . Currently , the most advanced method for describing the topology of an undirected network is based on the dependencies between different graphlets [ 21 ] . Subgraph properties are not only useful for describing the topology of networks , but they can also be utilized for describing the local wiring around nodes . For instance , degree describes the wiring around a node by counting the number of edges touching the node . Replacing edges with subgraphs of each kind in this definition , the local wiring around a node can be described by the number of subgraph patterns that the node participates in . While these subgraph statistics on nodes can be computed without imposing any orientations on the subgraphs [ 8 , 22 ] , a node’s role in the network can be characterized more accurately by introducing such orientation constraints based on the symmetries within the subgraphs [ 23 – 25 ] . For example , as illustrated in Figure 1 of [ 23 ] , and Fig . 1 here , there are 30 unique motif - roles on the 3 - node directed subgraph configurations . Przulj [ 25 ] identifies the orbits ( i . e . , the nodes that have identical wiring patterns within graphlets ) of all 2 - to 5 - node graphlets and uses these orbits to describe the wiring around a node by defining graphlet degree , which is the number of graphlets that touch a node at an orbit . Furthermore , the vector containing the graphlet degrees of all 73 orbits of 2 - to 5 - node graphlets is termed the graphlet degree vector and successfully applied for identifying the wiring similarities between the nodes of a network , and also , between the nodes of different networks [ 26 , 27 ] . It has been argued that analysis of neuronal connectome data will need to take into account node - referenced heterogeneity [ 28 – 30 ] , such as measured by Fig . 1 . All 13 three - node connected motifs and all 30 three - node connected motif - roles . A directed network is assumed . The numerical label for each motif ( denoted with the label m ) is identical to that used in [ 9 ] . Each distinct motif - role within each motif is denoted by different colours , and the numerical label next to each node . The numerical label provided for each motif - role is represented by the label r in the text and in Fig . 2 , where r ~ 1 , . . . , 30 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 . g001 Motif - Role - Fingerprints in Directed Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 December 8 , 2014 4 / 25 Fig . 2 . Formulae for counting the three - node motif - role fingerprints . The first column depicts the 9 distinct roles on functional motifs . Each row shows each three - node motif in which the corresponding role appears ( indexed by m ~ 1 , . . . 13 ) , and the plurality d r with which motif - role r appears within motif m ( see Methods ) . Motif - Role - Fingerprints in Directed Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 December 8 , 2014 5 / 25 graphlet degree . Another possible application is in the analysis of genetic networks [ 31 ] . The terminology on subgraph properties is not well - defined , with some studies using the terms ‘‘subgraphs’’ , ‘‘network motifs’’ and ‘‘graphlets’’ interchangeably . In order to avoid confusion , we use the term ‘‘ functional motifs ’’ to represent the partial subgraph properties ( e . g . , network motif properties defined in [ 9 ] ) , and ‘‘ structural motifs ’’ to represent the induced subgraph properties ( e . g . , graphlet properties defined in [ 10 , 25 ] ) in a consistent manner with [ 8 ] . Structural motifs quantify anatomical building blocks , whereas functional motifs represent elementary processing modes of the networks [ 22 ] . This distinction between structural and functional subgraph properties have different implications for neuronal networks : structural motifs describe all synapses amongst a specific subset of neurons . In contrast , functional motifs can describe , for example , potential patterns of actual synaptic activations occurring ( near ) simultaneously amongst a specific subset of neurons . It is expected to observe correlation between structural and functional subgraph properties to some extent . Even though this is the case , the wiring characteristics that can be captured by these two types of subgraphs differ . For example , a node’s importance in the networks as a ‘broker’ ( e . g . , r ~ 16 in Fig . 2 ) can only be captured by structural motifs since functional motifs consider also the cases that the node appears as roles r ~ 17 , 18 or 19 ( Fig . 2 ) . In these cases , the reference node is not a broker because of the edge between the two other nodes . For both structural and functional motifs , we consider four different types of subgraph frequency derived network properties , as follows : N Global Metrics : These metrics aim to describe the topology of an entire network . - Motif Counts : A network’s topology can be described by the number of subgraphs that appear in the network . We use the term motif counts to represent these networks statistics . Different from the original definition of network motifs [ 9 ] ( but consistent with usage in [ 8 ] ) , our motif statistics are independent of any comparison to null - hypothesis network model . For a given network , the corresponding motif counts form a M dimensional vector , each value representing the count for one of the M subgraphs . - Motif - Role Counts : A network’s topology can also be described in terms of the roles within subgraphs . We use the term motif - role counts to represent the number of times that a given motif role appears in a network . Motif - role counts can be directly obtained by scaling the motif counts depending on the number of times the motif - role appears within the corresponding subgraph . For a given Black filled circles indicate the nodes in motif m that play motif - role r ( see also Fig . 1 ) . The equations shown for each role , r , are the entries of the functional motif - role fingerprint matrix , F R , ( r , 1 : N ) , where 0 denotes the Hadamard product , 1 is an N | 1 unit column matrix , I is the N | N identity matrix , and R : ~ A 0 A T is the matrix of reciprocal edges . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 . g002 Motif - Role - Fingerprints in Directed Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 December 8 , 2014 6 / 25 network , the corresponding motif - role counts form an L dimensional vector , each value representing the number of times one of the L node roles appears in the network . N Node - referenced Metrics : These metrics aim to describe the local topology around a node in the network . - Motif Fingerprints : The wiring around a node in a network can be described by the number of subgraph patterns that it participates in , independent of the position ( i . e . , the role ) on these subgraphs . Such statistics have been termed motif fingerprints [ 8 , 22 ] . For each of the N nodes in a given network , the corresponding motif fingerprints are M dimensional vectors , each value corresponding to count of one of the M subgraphs that the node participates in . - Motif - Role Fingerprints : The wiring around a node in the network can be described at a finer detail by the number of subgraphs that touches the node at a specific orientation ( i . e . , on a node - role within the subgraph ) . We term such statistics as motif - role fingerprints . For each of the N nodes in a given network , the corresponding motif - role fingerprints are L dimensional vectors , each value corresponding to the number of subgraphs that touches a node at one of the L node - role positions . In this study , we explore the relationships between all these different types of subgraph statistics ( see Fig . 3 ) . First , we present efficient ways of calculating the functional motif - role fingerprints of a given directed network . Second , we show that structural motif statistics can be derived from functional motif statistics and vice versa . This transformation enables efficient computation of structural motif - fingerprints which are computationally more expensive to obtain . Third , we show that the motif - role fingerprints are the most fundamental and informative of all the other subgraph metrics . We identify the transformations that derive all other subgraph statistics ( i . e . , motif fingerprints , motif - role counts , motif counts ) from the motif - role fingerprints . Fourth , we discuss the relationships between motif - role fingerprints and directed clustering coefficients and transitivities , and show how these can be derived from motif - role fingerprints . Finally , we illustrate applications of these transformations on the neuronal connectome of c . elegans . Results and Discussion While exploring the relationships between different subgraph properties , we assume a directed network with N nodes . The adjacency matrix representation of a network ( A ) is an N | N matrix , where A½ i , j (cid:2) is 1 when there exists a directed edge from node i to node j , and otherwise 0 . We label each of the M ~ 13 connected three - node motifs with the index m ~ 1 , . . . , 13 according to the classification introduced by [ 9 ] —see Fig . 1 . When structural motifs of a directed network are considered , there are L ~ 30 different motif - roles , which we label with the index r ~ 1 , . . . , 30 , as illustrated in Fig . 1 . However , when considering the functional Motif - Role - Fingerprints in Directed Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 December 8 , 2014 7 / 25 motifs , these 30 motif - roles induces on 9 distinct roles—see Fig . 2 . The ordering of our labels is determined by these roles , and hence is non - sequential when depicted in Fig . 1 . Calculating Functional Motif - Role Fingerprints We introduce two L | N matrices , S R and F R , where the elements of the i – th column of these matrices is the transpose of the 1 | L vector that denotes the structural motif - role fingerprints and functional motif - role fingerprints , respec - tively , in which node i participates . Fig . 2 lists equations that can be used to efficiently obtain all elements of the matrix F R , in terms of the adjacency matrix , A . Further explanation on the computation of functional motif - role fingerprints is provided in the Methods section . Fig . 3 . Dependencies between metrics that count three - node directed subgraphs .

We extend the distinction between structural and functional motifs , and show that the motif - role fingerprints of these two types of motifs can be derived from each other . The mathematical relationship between structural and functional motif - role fingerprints can be conveniently expressed as F R ~ M SR ? FR S R , ð 1 Þ where M SR ? FR is an invertible L | L upper - triangular matrix , in which element ( i , j ) indicates how many copies of functional motif - role i are contained in structural motif - role j ( see Equation ( 27 ) in Methods ) . The fact that this matrix is invertible is important for numerical calculation of structural motif - role fingerprints . Although expressions for functional motif - role fingerprints can be efficiently calculated ( see above and Fig . 2 ) , it is more difficult to derive simple expressions for structural motif - role fingerprints . Instead , the inverse relationship S R ~ M { 1 SR ? FR F R , ð 2 Þ where M { 1 SR ? FR is given by Equation ( 28 ) in Methods , enables the structural motif - role fingerprint vector to be obtained without directly using the adjacency matrix . Moreover , the fact that M SR ? FR is invertible means that a unique structural motif - role fingerprint vector exists for any given functional motif - role fingerprint vector . Motif - Fingerprints and Global Motif Counts from Motif - Role Fingerprints We now introduce the motif - fingerprint matrices , S and F , each of size M | N , where the elements of the i – th column of these matrices denote the total number of structural motifs and functional motifs respectively in which node i participates [ 22 ] . The entries in the motif - fingerprints matrix can be trivially obtained from the motif - role fingerprints as follows : F ( m , 1 : N ) ~ X k [ Qm F R , ( k , 1 : N ) , m ~ 1 , : : , M , ð 3 Þ S ( m , 1 : N ) ~ X k [ Qm S R , ( k , 1 : N ) , m ~ 1 , : : , M , ð 4 Þ where Q m is the set of motif - role indices corresponding to motif index m . These sets can be readily identified in Fig . 1 . The relationship between structural and functional motif fingerprints can be expressed as Motif - Role - Fingerprints in Directed Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 December 8 , 2014 9 / 25 F ~ M S ? F S , ð 5 Þ where M S ? F is a 13 | 13 upper - diagonal invertible matrix in which element ( i , j ) indicates how many copies of functional motif i are contained in structural motif j ( see Equation ( 31 ) in Methods ) . Various methods exist for obtaining motif counts within networks , as reviewed by [ 32 ] . Here , we state how such counts for three - node motifs can be calculated from motif fingerprints . We introduce the length M vectors S and F , where the elements of each vector ( S m and F m , m ~ 1 , . . . , M ) denote the total number of structural motifs and functional motifs , respectively . Obtaining the global motif counts from the motif fingerprints is a simple matter of summing the fingerprints for all nodes , and dividing by three , since each global motif appears in the fingerprint of exactly three nodes : S > ~ 1 3 S 1 , F > ~ 1 3 F 1 , ð 6 Þ where we also have Fig . 4 . Structural motifs and motif - roles decompose into functional motifs and motif - roles . Illustration of the difference between structural and functional motifs and motif - roles . When counting structural motifs in a network , the connectivity between each set of three nodes is considered . In this case , if the nodes form motif m ~ 3 , then this counts as one instance of structural motif m ~ 3 , and no instances of structural motifs 1 or 2 . However , the same subgraph provides one instance each of functional motifs m ~ 1 , m ~ 2 , and m ~ 3 ( see also Fig . 1 in [ 22 ] for a similar illustration ) . Consequently , there are no more structural motifs in total than the number of combinations of three nodes . However , this is not the case for functional motifs , since the same set of three nodes can contain multiple functional motifs . The same decomposition occurs for motif - roles . In the example in this figure , a single instance of structural motif - role r ~ 24 decomposes into one instance each of functional motif - roles r ~ 13 , r ~ 16 and r ~ 24 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 . g004 Motif - Role - Fingerprints in Directed Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 December 8 , 2014 10 / 25 F > ~ M S ? F S > : ð 7 Þ Similarly to motif - role fingerprints , the existence of an invertible matrix for converting between functional and structural motifs implies that a unique structural motif or motif - fingerprint vector exists for any given functional motif or motif fingerprint vector . Directed Clustering Coefficients & Transitivities from Motif - Role Fingerprints We now consider directed clustering coefficients and directed transitivities , and demonstrate how they are simple derivatives of motif - role fingerprints . We begin by defining two length N vectors ; the first is the total number of closed directed triangles in which each node participates , V ~ F R , ( 11 , 1 : N ) z F R , ( 14 , 1 : N ) z F R , ( 17 , 1 : N ) z F R , ( 18 , 1 : N ) ~ 3 ( F 5 , ( 1 : N ) z F 9 , ( 1 : N ) ) , ð 8 Þ and the second is the total number of potential triangles in which each node may participate , T ~ 2 ( F R , ( 10 , 1 : N ) z F R , ( 13 , 1 : N ) z F R , ( 16 , 1 : N ) ) : ð 9 Þ The total directed clustering coefficient per node as derived by [ 4 ] may be expressed as the 1 | N vector C D ~ V (cid:3) T , ð 10 Þ where (cid:3) indicates Hadamard division . In any instance where division by zero occurs , we set the corresponding term of the result vector to zero . Because V cannot be written in terms of functional motif fingerprints ( since roles are integral to the definition of the various directed clustering coefficients ) , it is clear that finding specific functional motif - roles is a necessary step in finding the directed clustering coefficient . The global mean directed clustering coefficient is (cid:2) C D ~ C D 1 = N 0 ð 11 Þ ~ ( V (cid:3) T ) 1 = N 0 , ð 12 Þ where N 0 is the count of all nodes i for which T i = 0 . The transitivity of an undirected network is defined as the ratio of the total number of three - node subgraphs with three edges , to one third of the total number of pairs of edges that share a node [ 7 ] . Consequently , transitivity Motif - Role - Fingerprints in Directed Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 December 8 , 2014 11 / 25 measures the fraction of potential closed ‘triangles’ in a network that actually do form closed triangles . Generalization to a definition of directed transitivity was given by [ 8 ] . This can be re - expressed in terms of elements from the functional motif - role matrices as T D ~ ( V1 ) = ( T1 ) , ð 13 Þ or , unlike (cid:2) C D , in terms of functional motif counts as T D ~ 3 ( F 5 z F 9 ) 2 ( F 1 z F 2 z F 4 ) : ð 14 Þ In addition to the total directed clustering coefficient , [ 4 ] also described four sub - types of directed clustering coefficient , both on a per - node basis and as a global network average ( see also [ 6 ] ) . These arise from the four motif - roles that exist within the two closed - triangle motifs with no reciprocal edges , i . e . motifs 5 and 9 . In [ 4 ] these four types are referred to as ‘in’ , ‘out’ , ‘middleman’ and ‘cycle’ . Here we express these subtype clustering coefficients in terms of motif - role fingerprint vectors as C 2 { sink ~ 0 : 5 F R , ( 11 , 1 : N ) (cid:3) F R , ( 10 , 1 : N ) , ð 15 Þ C 2 { source ~ 0 : 5 F R , ( 14 , 1 : N ) (cid:3) F R , ( 13 , 1 : N ) , ð 16 Þ C Relay ~ F R , ( 17 , 1 : N ) (cid:3) F R , ( 16 , 1 : N ) , ð 17 Þ C Cycle ~ F R , ( 18 , 1 : N ) (cid:3) F R , ( 16 , 1 : N ) : ð 18 Þ The factors of 0 . 5 arise from the two possible edges that can be added to motif - roles 10 and 13 to form closed directed feed - forward triangles . We note that a comparison of the relative abundance of specific functional motif - role fingerprints for nodes of a given degree , with those in an in - or out - degree - preserving null - hypothesis network is equivalent to a comparison between elements of C vectors in the two networks . This is because a degree - preserving null - hypothesis network ensures that counts of motif - roles 10 , 13 and 16 do not change . On the other hand , the utility of per - node clustering coefficients is that normalisation enables comparisons between nodes with different degrees within the original network . The situation is different for structural motif - roles ; a null - hypothesis network will not have the same counts of structural motif - roles 10 , 13 and 16 as the original network , which suggests there is possible utility in defining directed structural clustering coefficients , as alternatives to those of [ 4 ] . This discussion also suggests that additional sub - type directed clustering coefficients could be of interest . For example , the 3 - feedforward clustering Motif - Role - Fingerprints in Directed Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 December 8 , 2014 12 / 25 coefficient : C 3FF ~ ( V { F R , ( 18 , 1 : N ) ) (cid:3) ( T { F R , ( 16 , 1 : N ) ) : ð 19 Þ The global mean directed clustering coefficients are trivially obtained in the same way as the global mean directed clustering coefficient , i . e , (cid:2) C subtype ~ C subtype 1 (cid:2) N subtype , 0 : ð 20 Þ The different subtypes of clustering coefficient introduced by [ 4 ] suggest analogous forms of directed transitivity : T 2 - sink ~ 0 : 5 F R , ( 11 , 1 : N ) 1 (cid:2) F R , ( 10 , 1 : N ) 1 ~ 0 : 5 F 5 = F 4 ð 21 Þ T 2 { source ~ 0 : 5 F R , ( 14 , 1 : N ) 1 (cid:2) F R , ( 13 , 1 : N ) 1 ~ 0 : 5 F 5 = F 1 ð 22 Þ T Relay ~ F R , ( 17 , 1 : N ) 1 (cid:2) F R , ( 16 , 1 : N ) 1 ~ F 5 = F 2 ð 23 Þ T Cycle ~ F R , ( 18 , 1 : N ) 1 (cid:2) F R , ( 16 , 1 : N ) 1 ~ 3 F 9 = F 2 ð 24 Þ T 3FF ~ ( V { F R , ( 18 , 1 : N ) ) 1 (cid:2) ( T { F R , ( 16 , 1 : N ) ) 1 ~ 3 F 5 = ( 2 F 1 z F 2 z 2 F 4 ) : ð 25 Þ In the first of the two equations for cycle transitivity , we have been able to arbitrarily choose one of the three roles for motif 2 in the denominator , since when summed over all N , the results are identical for all three roles . The last expression , for 3 - feedforward transitivity , quantifies the total fraction of possible non - cyclic directed closed triangles that exist in a network . Remarks on Undirected Networks The transitivity of a directed network without regard to the direction of the edges could potentially be of interest . Given that S i is the number of structural motif counts of type m ~ i , let C U ~ S 5 z S 6 z S 9 z S 10 z S 11 z S 12 z S 13 . The undirected transitivity can be written as Motif - Role - Fingerprints in Directed Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 December 8 , 2014 13 / 25 T U ~ C U C U z 13 ( S 1 z S 2 z S 3 z S 4 z S 7 z S 8 ) , ð 26 Þ where C U is the total number of closed triangles in a network written in terms of structural motifs counts . This result is equivalent to that of the standard definition of transitivity for an undirected network [ 7 , 33 ] , if the directed adjacency matrix was converted to undirected . Examples : Application to analysis of the C . elegans neuronal connectome As an example application , we calculated the structural and functional motif - role fingerprints for the C . elegans hermaphrodite and male neuronal networks . The results are shown in Table 1 , which enumerates the motif role fingerprints for neuron AVAR in the hermaphrodite . As mentioned , it is straightforward to derive the global subgraph ratio metrics ( i . e . , average directed clustering coefficients and directed transitivities ) from motif - role fingerprints , as indicated in the bottom right part of Fig . 3 . As described above , consideration of motif - role fingerprints led us to define six directed transitivities and six directed average clustering coefficients . Fig . 5 compares each of these transitivities and clustering coefficients for the two C . elegans neuronal networks , with those that result from in and out degree - preserving randomization of the C . elegans connectivity matrix . In each case , 20 randomized networks were created ( we found that this was many more than were necessary to obtain consistent and significant changes in all metrics ) , and their transitivities and average clustering coefficients are plotted . Our value of 0 . 22 for the directed clustering coefficient of the source role ( C 2 { source ) is consistent with result published in [ 17 ] , as is our value for the corresponding randomized network of 0 . 076 ) but none of the other directed clustering coefficients were mentioned in [ 17 ] . We observe that the C . elegans hermaphrodite chemical synapse network is between 1 . 2 and 3 . 3 times more transitive or clustered ( depending on the specific metric ) than degree - preserving randomizations of the network ( ratios were calculated with respect to the mean of the statistics for all network randomiza - tions ) . This result is consistent with previous evaluations of clustering coefficient for this network ( e . g . , [ 17 ] ) . It is also clear , however , that among all the metrics , cycles have the smallest ratio , for both directed transitivity and average directed clustering coefficient . This is also consistent with prior analysis , such as that obtained via standard directed motif analysis — see Figure 7 in [ 17 ] . We also found that the male has higher ratios than the hermaphrodite , ranging from 2 . 1 to 3 . 9 times more transitive or clustered than the corresponding null hypothesis networks . It is potentially of interest ( both for C . elegans , and any other neuronal network data ) to consider whether functional significance can be inferred from this form of Motif - Role - Fingerprints in Directed Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 December 8 , 2014 14 / 25 analysis of directed clustering coefficient and transitivities . We expect , however , that analysis of motif - role fingerprints will likely be more revealing . Next , we aim to identify particular network nodes that participate in an overabundance of some specific role , compared to a randomized network . A simple example that illustrates the utility of obtaining motif - role - fingerprints is as follows . For the C . elegans hermaphrodite , we obtained 20 randomized networks , and identified the individual neuron that participated in the greatest number of each of the 30 roles , above the mean obtained in the randomized network . For many of the roles , we observed that the highly ranked neuron according to this metric had a high in and / or out degree . So next , we scaled by the Table 1 .

In this manner , we observed that neuron RIAL participates in 234 separate instances of functional motif - role 20 , whereas in the corresponding randomized networks , RIAL on average participated in 53 . 3 instances of functional motif - role 20 . This can be explained statistically , since RIAL participates in 9 reciprocal edge pairs to and from other neurons , and the our randomization algorithm does not preserve reciprocal degree , only in and out - degree . A case of a neuron participating in an overabundance of a role that does not include reciprocal edges is that of neuron FLPR , and role 14 . In the C . elegans network , FLPR participates in 80 instances of functional motif - role 14 . The mean number of participations in the randomized networks , however , is only 14 . 75 . Since motif - role 14 involves two outward edges from the reference node , and an edge between the two destination nodes , the motif - role analysis suggests that a role of neuron FLPR is to influence pairs of nodes that are themselves connected . These few examples illustrate one of the potential applications for motif - role fingerprints : to identify interesting or anomalous nodes within a directed network so that further analysis or experimentation can be carried out on that node or its neighbors . Fig . 5 . Directed transitivities and average clustering coefficients for two directed C . elegans chemical synapse networks , and randomisations of those networks . Circles show each of the six directed transitivities and six directed clustering coefficient values for the C . elegans hermaphrodite and male networks . Dots show comparison points obtained from each of 20 degree - preserving randomizations of the two connectivity matrices . Clearly the male exhibits higher transitivity and clustering than the hermaphrodite , according to all 12 statistics , but both real networks are more transitive / clustered than corresponding null - hypothesis networks . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 . g005 Motif - Role - Fingerprints in Directed Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 December 8 , 2014 16 / 25 Future Extensions and Applications In order to account for heterogeneity in network structure and node types , we have derived mathematical relationships that we expect to be useful when motif distributions need to be characterised , either structurally or functionally , on a node - participation basis , rather than relative to the entire network . We have demonstrated that a hierarchy of relevant metrics exist , with summary metrics such as transitivity derived from richer and more informative vector statistics . The dependencies between each metric discussed are summarized in Fig . 3 . We now discuss some anticipated applications and extensions of this work . Analysis of Neuronal Connectome Data and Synaptic Polarities Although the neuronal network of the nematode worm , C . elegans , is the only complete neuronal network obtained to date [ 17 ] , network analysis will soon be required for the large neuronal network data sets that result from new experimental techniques currently under rapid development [ 28 , 34 ] . Indeed , new methods have already resulted in a second partial neuronal network for the C . elegans male [ 19 ] , and we used resulting network data in this paper . In previous work on motifs applied to neuronal networks , it was observed that combining topological data with data on the functional role of neurons in C . elegans ( sensory , motor or interneuron ) allows a richer analysis of motif distributions with greater relevance to understanding than does describing structural motifs alone [ 18 ] . Both the work of [ 18 ] , and the analysis of motifs in [ 16 , 17 , 22 ] , however , characterized the hermaphrodite C . elegans neuronal network only in terms of overall abundance of each kind of motif , and did not study the number of motifs of each kind in which individual neurons participate . This is also the case for the analysis of the male posterior neuronal network reported by [ 19 ] . One possible direction is to use motif - roles to quantify the centrality of particular neurons within a network , such as by extending the work of [ 35 ] to take roles into account . We anticipate that sophisticated analyses of directed complex neuronal network in future will make use of node - referenced role information , such as that provided by motif - role fingerprints discussed in this paper . Analysis of topological roles in neuronal connectome data could also be supplemented by physiological information , such as the polarity ( excitatory or inhibitory ) of synapses [ 30 ] . This could be modelled as signed edges , and motif - roles generalised to Signed - motif - roles . Subgraphs with More Than Three Nodes We note that the concept of motif - role fingerprints , either functional or structural , can be extended to arbitrary numbers of nodes per subgraph . For motifs with more than three nodes , however , the number of motif - role types becomes very large , which means that obtaining expressions for each element of F R is more difficult . For example , it is known that for four - node subgraphs , there are 199 different connected directed subgraphs . We have not counted how many unique roles there are within each of these , but obviously there are at most a total Motif - Role - Fingerprints in Directed Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 December 8 , 2014 17 / 25 of 4 | 199 motif - roles for 4 - node subgraphs . Calculation of M S R ? F R would also be tedious . Still , it need only be carried out once . Although we leave this calculation for future work , we note that if this matrix was unknown , but alternative methods for finding both functional and structural motif - role fingerprint counts were available , then M S R ? F R can readily be derived empirically using data from random directed networks . We have used this method to obtain the matrix M S ? F ( and its inverse ) for the case of 4 - node global motifs . This was achieved using the Matlab software package known as the Brain Connectivity Toolbox , made available in association with [ 8 ] , which provides code for obtaining global functional and structural motif counts for 4 - node connected subgraphs . Extension to Weighted Network Edges The definition of motifs ( in the global sense ) has previously been extended to incorporate information about edge weights [ 36 ] . The resulting metric was referred to as subgraph intensity . It is potentially useful to extend this idea to motif - roles , and perhaps it will be as simple as replacing the binary adjacency matrix A with a weighted adjacency matrix W in the equations shown in Fig . 2 . However , we leave consideration of this possibility for future work . Possible use in role detection and detection of similar nodes and similar networks There has been recent interest in automatic discovery of network roles , and nodes that are structurally similar , and algorithms have been developed for achieving this [ 37 ] . The methods described in [ 37 ] are flexible in the sense that many different network statistics can be provided as inputs from which roles are identified . There is strong potential for including motif - role fingerprints as a subset of the network statistics used in such algorithms . If , in the future , many large connectome datasets become available , it may be potentially interesting to assess the resulting networks for overall similarity , or to search for similar nodes within or across networks .

Notation for Functional Motif - Role Fingerprints in Fig . 2 For a network with N nodes , we denote the N | N binary directed adjacency matrix as A ( A i , j [ f 0 , 1 g V i , j ) . We assume that diag ( A ) ~ 0 , i . e there are no self - connections . In the formulae listed in Fig . 2 , we make use of the matrix R : ~ A 0 A > , which is a binary matrix where each 1 indicates a reciprocal edge between two nodes . Motif - Role - Fingerprints in Directed Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114503 December 8 , 2014 18 / 25 The symbol 0 denotes the Hadamard ( or Schmur ) product , which is equivalent to term by term multiplication of two matrices of the same size . Although some of the formulae can be rewritten in terms of the diag ( : ) operator ( e . g . F R , ( 30 , 1 : N ) ~ diag ( R 3 ) ) , we have aimed to show that all elements of F R can be obtained with no more than two N | N matrix multiplications and two Hadamard products , thus avoiding unnecessary multiplications . Since there are three nodes in each motif , there can be no more than 3 role types for each motif ; there are less in some instances where more than one node has the same role . Consequently , the figure also shows the number of nodes , d r , within each motif that play role r , and we have P Lr ~ 1 d r ~ 3 M . For completeness , we note that in our notation the matrix products A 1 and A > 1 provide expressions for the out - degrees and in - degrees of each node , while R 1 provides an expression for the total number of reciprocal edges in which each node participates . Also , we have AA > as the ‘Co - citation matrix’ [ 38 ] and A > A as the ‘bibliographic coupling matrix’ [ 38 ] . Converting structural to functional motif - role fingerprints and vice - versa The following 30 | 30 matrix enables conversion from structural motif - role fingerprints , S R to functional motif - role fingerprints , F R , as expressed in Equation ( 1 ) .

To make this relationship explicit , we introduce the following 13 | 3 matrix composed from the elements of F R ( denoted as F R , k , k ~ 1 , . . . , 30 ) to explicitly denote which functional roles are associated with which functional motifs : F M R ~ F R , 1 F R , 2 0 F R , 3 F R , 4 F R , 5 F R , 6 F R , 7 F R , 8 F R , 9 F R , 10 0 F R , 11 F R , 12 F R , 13 F R , 14 F R , 15 0 F R , 16 F R , 17 F R , 18 F R , 19 F R , 20 0 F R , 21 0 0 F R , 22 F R , 23 F R , 24 F R , 25 F R , 26 0 F R , 27 F R , 28 F R , 29 F R , 30 0 0 0 BBBBBBBBBBBBB BB BBBBBBBBBBBBB @ 1 CCCCCCCCCCCCC CC CCCCCCCCCCCCCA ð 33 Þ The i – th row in F M R indicates motif i , i ~ 1 , . . . , 13 . A zero appears for any motif in which more than one node plays the same role . Where F M R has three non - zero elements , they all have the same value , which is equal to the total number of functional motifs corresponding to that row . Where it has two elements , one element is twice the other , where the element multiplied by 2 is that indicated by d r ~ 2 in Fig . 2 . Similarly , where there is one element , it is multiplied by 3 as indicated by d r ~ 3 in Fig . 2 . We also introduce S MR to denote the equivalent matrix for structural motifs . The total count of structural or functional motifs in a network can be trivially obtained from S MR and F MR respectively by S > ~ 1 3 S MR 1 3 ð 34 Þ F > ~ 1 3 F MR 1 3 , ð 35 Þ where 1 3 is a unit 3 | 1 column matrix .
