We show that the spectrum of ﬂuctuations of the number of vertices with a given degree is Poissonian . These mesoscopic ﬂuctuations are strong in the large - degree region , where P ( k ) < ∼ 1 / N ( N is the total number of vertices in a network ) , and are important in networks with fat - tailed degree distributions . 05 . 10 . - a , 05 - 40 . - a , 05 - 50 . + q , 87 . 18 . Sn Fluctuations in ﬁnite systems , which vanish in the in - ﬁnite system limit , is a basic topic of mesoscopic physics . The study of these ﬂuctuations is an exciting ﬁeld of con - densed matter physics [ 1 , 2 ] , where small objects attract much attention . Despite the fast recent progress in the statistical physics of networks [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] , the ﬁnite - size eﬀects in networks are surprisingly poorly studied . However , real networks , as a rule , are small objects , and their ﬁniteness is a factor of primary importance . Impressive results ob - tained for inﬁnite nets often turn out to be incorrect if we take into account the ﬁniteness of networks ( see de - tailed discussion in Refs . [ 6 , 7 ] ) . For example , the abso - lute random - damage stability of inﬁnite networks with fat - tailed degree distributions and the absence of an epi - demic threshold in these nets ( that is , their absolute dis - ease vulnerability ) vanish in ﬁnite - size networks [ 8 ] . The ﬁniteness of networks with fat - tailed degree distri - butions cutoﬀs the tails of the degree distributions ( see , e . g . , Refs . [ 9 , 10 , 11 ] ) . In this communication we consider another mesoscopic eﬀect which is clearly observable in empirical data . We describe ﬂuctuations of the number of vertices N ( k ) with a given number of connections k in a network . k is called degree , or , not quite rigorously , connectivity of a vertex . We consider a simple equilib - rium situation , where the total numbers of vertices N and edges L in a network are constant , and comment a more complex case of ﬂuctuations in growing networks ( see calculations in Ref . [ 10 ] ) . Our general results are formulated as follows : for any k , the ﬂuctuations of N ( k ) are described by the Pois - son distribution . These ﬂuctuations are of primary im - portance in the large - degree range , where the average h N ( k ) i < ∼ 1 . A random network is , actually , a statistical ensemble G which includes numerous members g ∈ G [ 11 , 12 ] . These are diﬀerent particular realizations of the network . Each member g enters into the ensemble with its statistical weight Π ( g ) . When empirical researchers study a single realization of an ensemble , they measure N ( k ) , i . e . the number of vertices of a degree k in this realization . If they have a possibility to investigate the complete ensemble , they can obtain the distribution of the ﬂuctuations of N ( k ) at any k , that is P ( N ( k ) ) . In particular , the ﬁrst mo - ment of this distribution provides the degree distribution : h N ( k ) i = NP ( k ) . So , studying only one member of the ensemble or a few ones , one can ﬁnd the degree distribu - tion only approximately . There is a speciﬁc network construction , where ﬂuc - tuations of N ( k ) are absent by deﬁnition . These are so called “labeled random graphs with a given degree se - quence” [ 13 ] from graph theory , which are , loosely speak - ing , the maximally random graphs with a given sequence { N ( k ) } , P k N ( k ) = N . Consequently , in this situation , P ( k ) = N ( k ) / N . These graphs are extensively used in numerous applications [ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 ] , and , of course , the absence of ﬂuctuations is related only to their N ( k ) . So that , this is an exception . Here we study ﬂuctuations in the dynamically con - structed networks that are equivalent to the random graphs with a given degree sequence in the thermody - namic limit , where ﬂuctuations vanish . Let us consider an equilibrium random network with a ﬁxed number of vertices N in which all vertices are statistically indepen - dent . Let a full set of probabilities { P ( k ) } , k = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . that a vertex has degree k be given , but the total number of edges in particular members of this ensemble be not ﬁxed . Taking into account the statistical independence of vertices we arrive at a standard combinatorial problem . So , a probability that a sequence { N ( k ) } ( P k N ( k ) = N ) is realized in a member of the ensemble has the following form : P ( { N ( k ) } ) = N ! Y k [ P ( k ) ] N ( k ) N ( k ) ! . ( 1 ) This is a polynomial distribution from which the bino - mial form of the distribution of the numbers N ( k ) ( the ﬂuctuation spectrum of N ( k ) ) directly follows : P ( N ( k ) ) = (cid:18) N N ( k ) (cid:19) P ( k ) N ( k ) [ 1 − P ( k ) ] N − N ( k ) , ( 2 ) This form , for suﬃciently large networks , results in the Poisson spectrum of the ﬂuctuations : 1 P ( N ( k ) ) = e −h N ( k ) i h N ( k ) i N ( k ) N ( k ) ! , ( 3 ) which in turn approaches the Gaussian form P ( N ( k ) ) ∼ = 1 p 2 π h N ( k ) i exp (cid:26) − [ ( N ( k ) − h N ( k ) i ] 2 2 h N ( k ) i (cid:27) . ( 4 ) when h N ( k ) i ≫ 1 ( or P ( k ) ≫ 1 / N ) while the ratio [ N ( k ) − h N ( k ) i ] / p h N ( k ) i is ﬁxed , that is when relative ﬂuctuations are small . Note that these general results are valid both for directed and undirected networks . Now , let the number L of edges in the realizations of an ensemble be ﬁxed . In this event , the combinatorics at ﬁnite N turns out to be slightly more complex , and we use a more convenient approach for suﬃciently large net - works . We consider ﬂuctuations in the dynamically con - structed equilibrium networks ( with the ﬁxed number of vertices and edges ) that are equivalent to the above net - works with a ﬁxed L ( and to the random graphs with a given degree sequence ) in the thermodynamic limit , where ﬂuctuations vanish . Let us remind the construc - tion and a standard statistical mechanics formalism [ 12 ] which allows easy calculation of averages . ( 1 ) The ensemble includes all graphs with a given num - bers of vertices , N , and edges , L . ( 2 ) The stationary statistical weights of the realizations are a limiting result of the following process . Ran - dom ends of randomly chosen edges are rewired to preferentially chosen vertices at a rate f ( k i ) , where the rate depends on the degree k i of a target vertex . The function f ( k ) and the mean degree k = 2 L / N determine the structure of this random network . ( For brevity , here we consider undirected networks and do not discuss multiplication of edges . This will not inﬂuence our results . ) The resulting statistical weights in this en - semble are products Π ( g ) ∝ Q Ni = 1 p ( k i ) , where p ( k > 0 ) = k − 1 Y q = 0 f ( q ) , p ( 0 ) = 1 . ( 5 ) At large N , the asymptotic expression for the partition function Z = P g ∈ G Π ( g ) of the ensemble is Z ( { p ( ˜ k ) } , N , L ) ∼ (cid:18) k ex 2 s (cid:19) L [ Φ ( x s ) ] N . ( 6 ) where Φ ( x ) = X k p ( k ) k ! x k , ( 7 ) and x s is given by the equation k = x s Φ ′ ( x s ) / Φ ( x s ) . With this partition function , the following standard statistical mechanics relations are valid : C 1 ( k ) = h N ( k ) i = δ ln Z ( { p ( ˜ k ) } , N , L ) δ ln p ( k ) , C 2 ( k , k ′ ) = h N ( k ) N ( k ′ ) i − h N ( k ) ih N ( k ′ ) i = δ 2 ln Z ( { p ( ˜ k ) } , N , L ) δ ln p ( k ) δ ln p ( k ′ ) , ( 8 ) and so on for the higher cumulants C n ( k 1 , . . . k n ) which contain higher order products of N ( k ) . Substituting Eqs . ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) into Eq . ( 8 ) readily shows that at suﬃciently large N , when h N ( k ) i ≪ N , ( 1 ) C n ( k 1 , . . . k n ) is nonzero only if k 1 = k 2 = . . . = k n , so there is no correlation between numbers of vertices of diﬀerent degrees , and that ( 2 ) all the cumulants are equal : C n ≥ 1 ( k ) = C 1 ( k ) = h N ( k ) i = NP ( k ) . The latter is the characteristic property of the Poisson distribution . Consequently , the spectrum of the ﬂuctua - tions of N ( k ) is Poissonian , and we again arrive at the same expressions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) as for networks with ﬂuc - tuating L . This universal result does not depend on the speciﬁc parameters of the model which can be easily gen - eralized . l n N ( k ) ln N [ 1 / ( γ−1 ) ] ln k ln N ( 1 / γ ) FIG . 1 . Typical ( schematic ) log - log plot of the num - ber N ( k ) of vertices of degree k in a scale - free network ( one realization ) . γ is the exponent of the degree dis - tribution . The ﬂuctuations are observable in the region ( 1 / γ ) ln N < ∼ ln k < ∼ [ 1 / ( γ − 1 ) ] ln N . The ﬂuctuations of N ( k ) vanish in the thermodynamic limit if k is ﬁxed . On the other hand , the ﬂuctuations are strong in the region of large degrees where h N ( k ) i < ∼ 1 , that is P ( k ) < ∼ 1 / N . The condition P ( k m ) = 1 / N deter - mines the lower boundary k m of this region . The position of the cut - oﬀ of the fat - tailed degree distribution may de - pend on many factors . In general terms , the maximum possible degree of the cut - oﬀ k c is determined by the ﬁnite size of the network : N R ∞ k c dkP ∞ ( k ) ∼ 1 , where P ∞ ( k ) is the degree distribution of the corresponding inﬁnite 2 network ( note the discussion of the complex problem of the cut - oﬀ position in Ref . [ 11 ] ) . k c is an estimate of the maximum vertex degree in a network and so is the upper boundary of the region , where the strong ﬂuctuations are observable . In so - called scale - free networks , where P ∞ ( k ) ∝ k − γ , the strong ﬂuctuations should be seen in the broad region ( 1 / γ ) ln N < ∼ ln k < ∼ [ 1 / ( γ − 1 ) ] ln N ( see Fig . 1 ) . One should note that in equilibrium networks , the fat - tailed regime can be realized only starting from some threshold value of the mean degree [ 12 ] . Below this threshold , a size - independent cut - oﬀ of the degree distri - bution sharply narrows the region of strong ﬂuctuations . The Poisson spectrum of ﬂuctuations of N ( k ) in equi - librium networks is a natural consequence of the statisti - cal independence of their vertices . In models of growing networks ( e . g . , see Refs . [ 18 , 19 , 20 ] ) , the ﬂuctuations of N ( k ) were calculated only in a small degree region and were found to be Gaussian [ 10 ] . The interesting region of strong ﬂuctuations in growing nets ( and in the Simon model [ 21 ] ) is not studied yet . Although the problem is open , we suggest that the complete ﬂuctuation spectrum of growing networks does not diﬀer essentially from the spectrum of the ﬂuctuations in equilibrium networks . In summary , we have shown that the ﬂuctuation spec - trum of the number of vertices of a given degree is Poissonian in equilibrium networks . These ﬂuctuations are a prominent mesoscopic eﬀect and are seen in the large - degree region of empirical degree distributions . As a rule , empirical researchers try to avoid ﬂuctuations by passing to cumulative distributions . But ﬂuctuations are interesting , and the simple ﬂuctuations of N ( k ) that we have considered is only a very particular type of ﬂuctu - ations in networks . We hope to attract the attention of empirical researches to this problem . S . N . D . was partially supported by the project POCTI / 1999 / FIS / 33141 . A . N .
