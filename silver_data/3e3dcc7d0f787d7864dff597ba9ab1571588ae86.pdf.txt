D . Washington State University December 2010 Chair : Nehal I . Abu - Lail , Ph . D . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) has been used to probe some of the biophysical properties of virulent and avirulent Listeria . In the first study , the relationship between the pathogenic L . monocytogenes in vitro adhesion to a model inert surface and their in vivo virulence was investigated . Our results indicated that the nanoscale adhesion forces quantified between eight L . monocytogenes strains that varied in their virulence and silicon nitride in water were logarithmically correlated with strains’ virulence . In the second study , the relationship between adherence and virulence was investigated across the genus Listeria . In addition , the heterogeneities in the adhesion measurements were quantified and correlated with the ex vivo bacterial adhesion and the in vivo virulence . Our results indicated that virulent Listeria species v were characterized by significantly larger adhesion energies to silicon nitride compared to those of the avirulent species . The heterogeneities in the femto - Joule adhesion energies quantified between bacterial strains and silicon nitride in water increased as the magnitudes of adhesion energies increased and as the virulence of the bacterial strains investigated increased . In the third study , the relationship between the nano - mechanical properties of bacterial cells and surface biopolymers and bacterial virulence was investigated for L . monocytogenes virulent and avirulent strains . Our results indicated that the virulent strains were characterized by more flexible biopolymers , longer and denser biopolymer brushes and thus more rigid bacterial cells compared to the avirulent strains . Our last study investigated in details the means by which a pathogenic L . monocytogenes strain survives under chemical stress . We as well investigated the relationship between the bacterial adhesion energies quantified for individual L . monocytogenes cells and the adhesion energies quantified for lawns of L . monocytogenes cells under chemical stress . Our results indicated that L . monocytogenes cells adapt well in all pH conditions investigated ( pH 5 to pH 9 ) . Contact angle measurements on lawns of L . monocytogenes cells indicated that the bacterial surface was always hydrophilic irrespective of the pH conditions of growth . Finally , the femto - Joule scale interaction energies of L . monocytogenes calculated from AFM measurement scaled linearly with macroscale surface adhesion energies estimated using the thermodynamic - based approach . vi Table of Contents Page Acknowledgement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . iii Abstract . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . iv List of Tables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . xiv List of Figures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . xvi List of Figures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . xvi Chapter 1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 1 . 1 Problem Statement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 1 . 2 Research Objectives . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 1 . 3 Literature Review . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 1 . 3 . 1 The Genus Listeria . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 1 . 3 . 1 . 1 Listeria monocytogenes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 1 . 3 . 2 Bacterial Pathogenicity and Virulence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16 1 . 3 . 2 . 1 Virulence of L . monocytogenes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19 1 . 3 . 3 Measurements of Bacterial Interactions and Properties . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 1 . 3 . 3 . 1 AFM Quantification of Bacterial Adhesion Forces to Surfaces . . . . . . . . 21 1 . 3 . 3 . 2 AFM Quantification of Bacterial Adhesion Energies to Surfaces . . . . 25 vii 1 . 3 . 3 . 3 AFM Quantification of Bacterial Cells’ Elasticity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29 1 . 3 . 3 . 4 AFM Quantification of the Elasticity of Bacterial Surface Biopolymers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31 1 . 3 . 3 . 5 AFM Quantification of the Heterogeneity in Bacterial Surface Biopolymers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33 1 . 3 . 4 Models Used to Quantify Bacterial Properties and Interactions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34 1 . 3 . 4 . 1 Hertz Model of Contact Mechanics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34 1 . 3 . 4 . 2 Steric Model of Electrosteric Repulsions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37 1 . 3 . 4 . 3 Statistical Thermodynamic Models of Polymer Elasticity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39 1 . 3 . 5 Statistical Analysis of AFM data . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 1 . 4 Organization of the Dissertation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43 1 . 5 .

Examples on issues in which bacterial involvement can be beneficial are environmental bioremediation 2 , solid - state fermentation 3 , and microbial fuel cell energy applications 4 . Examples on issues in which bacterial involvement can be harmful are contamination of drinking water supplies 5 , food poisoning 6 , dental plague 7 , corrosion 8 and bacterial infections 9 . The abilities of bacteria to contribute to these various processes largely depend on their ability to survive , proliferate and stick efficiently to a wide array of inert and biotic surfaces and in a wide spectrum of environmental conditions 1 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 . While many research efforts were extensively focused on studying the macroscale attachment of bacteria to different surfaces , a fundamental understanding of the role of certain 2 factors on bacterial properties and interactions as bacteria cross strains , species , to even genus is largely missing . For example , researchers have explored in details the role of surface proteins in virulence of Listeria species 6 , 11 , 12 . However , a thorough understanding of how these surface proteins influence the adherence of Listeria species to inert and biotic surfaces or the role of these proteins in controlling some of the bacterial biophysical properties such as mechanical properties or charge distributions on the bacterial surfaces are largely missing . The current methodology of investigating bacterial properties , interactions and virulence is largely focused on investigating a well defined microbial system . This means that a study will generally use a single bacterial strain or few bacterial mutants and then quantify their properties and interactions to certain surfaces under fixed environmental conditions . This methodology limits the applicability of the results of the study to only the experimental system investigated . Such approach severely hinders our ability to predict and control bacterial adhesion and virulence . However , it has to be noted that the approach above is largely influenced by the complexity of the bacterial surface and interactions system . Research studies were always focused on decoupling the effect of various chemical , physical or biological factors on bacterial properties , interactions and virulence . Examples on the factors that influence bacterial properties , interactions and virulence are the characteristics of the bacterial cell including the bacterial surface composition of biopolymers 13 , the heterogeneity of charge distribution on bacterial 3 surface 14 , the motility of the cell 15 , the growth phase of the cell 16 , the cell mechanical properties 17 , and the hydrophobicity of the bacterial surface 18 . In addition , the properties of the substrate to which bacteria will attach to such as the substrate charge 19 , roughness 1 , and wettability 20 are equally important . Finally , the environmental conditions under which the bacterial adhesion or virulence processes are taking place such as temperature 6 , pH 21 , ionic strength 22 , and the presence of chemical factors such as antibiotics 23 in the bacterial growth media have a large influence on the success of the processes . In addition to the limits of the approach used in the studies discussed above , most of studies performed to investigate bacterial adhesion and virulence were carried using macroscale systems 1 . Although macroscopic investigations of bacterial properties , interactions and virulence are important to certain applications ( i . e . prevention of biofilms ) , macroscopic studies are limited in their resolution and in their abilities to fundamentally understand the first initial main steps leading to biofilm formation or virulence . For examples , a biofilm study addresses the behavior of an ensemble of bacterial cells , making it difficult to appreciate how single cells may contribute to the overall process . To overcome the methodology limitations outlined above , I designed and planned my experiments such as commonalities between various bacterial strains that belong to one species or to various species across a genus can be investigated . This approach has an edge over current 4 methodologies by allowing trends and relationships to be developed across bacterial strains of different origin . Second , my experiments were all carried at the nanoscale and in well controlled environments . Nanoscale measurements of bacterial properties and interactions are relatively new methodologies that offer unique ways to developing a fundamental understanding to the initial steps involved in the bacterial adhesion process . Not only that , such studies allow the contributions of single cells to the overall process to be quantified and to be compared as well to other cells in the same bacterial population . Revealing heterogeneities among cells that belong to a certain bacterial population is very important to designing better tools to predict and control bacterial adhesion and virulence processes . For all the papers in this dissertation , bacterial strains that belong to the genus Listeria were chosen as our model bacteria for five main reasons . First , the genus Listeria is only composed of six species . Those species are L . monocytogenes , L . ivanovii , L . innocua , L . welshimeri , L . seeligeri and L . grayi 6 , 24 . Because of the limited number of species that belong to the genus , bacterial strains that represent all the species that belong to the Listeria genus can be investigated . This is important as it will allow us to generalize findings across species that belong to a certain genus . With the exception of Listeria monocytogenes , one strain per other Listeria species was investigated . Second , the genus Listeria incorporates both pathogenic and non - pathogenic bacterial species . L . monocytogenes and L . ivanovii are the pathogenic ones with the 5 difference that the later one is only pathogenic in animals and the other four species ( L . innocua , L . welshimeri , L . seeligeri , L . grayi ) are non - pathogenic 6 , 24 . In addition , although L . monocytogenes are classified as pathogenic Listeria species , not all its strains are virulent . Therefore , I have worked in this thesis with eight L . monocytogenes species that gradually vary in their virulence . This is important to investigate how biophysical properties of bacterial strains vary as a function of virulence with a species and across various species that belong to a genus . Third , Listeria are Gram - positive bacteria . As most Gram - positive bacterial cells , the surface of L . monocytogenes is composed of mixture of proteins and carbohydrates , called peptidoglycans which are significantly different to Gram - negative bacterial cells 7 . While the polysaccharides properties of Gram - negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli JM109 and Pseudomonas putida KT2442 are well documented in the literature 25 - 27 , the peptidoglycan properties of Gram - positive bacteria have been rarely reported 23 . The limited literature on Gram - positive bacterial cells makes the findings of this dissertation unique and useful to many researchers working in the filed . Fourth , as food - borne pathogens , Listeria species are widely distributed around us and known for their resiliency and smart - adaptation strategies in the environment 6 , 28 - 39 . For example , L . monocytogenes are known for their ability to survive in temperatures as low as 1 o C 37 , 38 , in presence of high - salt concentrations as high as 10 % NaCl 6 , 39 and in wide range of pH values ( pH 4 to 9 . 5 ) 28 , 39 . Their unique adaptation strategies and the wide range of 6 environmental conditions they survive in represent them as an ideal set of bacteria to investigate role of environmental stress on their properties and adhesion to surfaces . Finally , Listeria in general and L . monocytogenes species in particular are microbes of interest for the several researchers in the Department of Microbiology and Veterinary Pathology at Washington Sate University . This was particularly important as we were able to get a wide spectrum of bacterial strains and in some instances mutants of some strains as well . 1 . 2 Research Objectives With the use of L . monocytogenes strains that vary in their virulence level and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) as the primary investigation tool , the first goal of my research ( Chapter 2 ) was to improve our understanding of the relationship between the nanoscale adhesion of L . monocytogenes to a model inert surface of silicon nitride and the microbe’s virulence . Although the intracellular path of L . monocytogenes to infection is well understood for an organism 40 , the extracellular path involving bacterial attachment to inert surfaces followed by bacterial survival and growth is poorly understood 41 . Since bacterial attachment to inert surfaces ex vivo is considered as the first step towards infection , the question of how L . monocytogenes in vitro adhesion to inert surfaces affect their in vivo virulence needed to be answered 42 . To investigate this relationship , I measured the nanoscale adhesion of eight L . monocytogenes strains that vary in their in vivo virulence level to a model inert surface of silicon nitride using AFM . The 7 adhesion forces quantified were then correlated with the in vivo virulence of these strains quantified by the lethal dose required to kill 50 % of mice in research study ( LD50 ) . The LD50 values for the strains used were previously determined by other group 43 . Our results indicated the presence of a logarithmic relationship between L . monocytogenes virulence represented by LD50 and the bacterial nanoscale adhesion to silicon nitride . This part of my study suggested that variations observed in the adhesion forces measured between the surface biopolymers of L . monocytogenes strains that vary in their virulence and silicon nitride could be attributed to variations in surface compositions and surface properties among the strains tested 44 , 45 . The large magnitudes of the standard deviations quantified for the interaction forces measured between the L . monocytogenes strains used in the study above and silicon nitride AFM tips were the motive behind the study in Chapter 3 . The large standard deviations are commonly viewed by researchers as an error in the measurements and largely interpreted as a lack of reproducibility in the measurements . This is not true when it comes to AFM bacterial adhesion measurements to inert surfaces . Large standard deviations in AFM bacterial adhesion measurements reflect mainly the heterogeneous dynamic nature of the bacterial surface . Bacterial surfaces are composed of many types of biopolymers including proteins , polysaccharides and peptidoglycans 46 - 50 . The studies shown in Chapter three had three main research goals . First , investigate heterogeneities in bacterial adhesion energies quantified between bacterial cells a 8 model inert surface of silicon nitride in water at four levels . Level one was to map the surface heterogeneities in bacterial adhesion energies quantified between silicon nitride and different locations on a single L . monocytogenes cell surface . Level two was to investigate heterogeneities in the adhesion energies quantified between silicon nitride and cells that belonged to one bacterial strain type ( i . e . L . monocytogenes EGDe ) and grown in identical conditions but were taken from different cultures . Level three was to investigate heterogeneities in the adhesion energies quantified between silicon nitride and bacterial cells that belonged to one species ( L . monocytogenes ) but different strains ( 19112 , 19115 , 19118 , 1002 , 874 , 15313 , HCC25 , and EGDe ) . Level four was to investigate heterogeneities in the adhesion energies quantified between silicon nitride and bacterial cells that represented all species of the Listeria genus ( L . monocytogenes , L . ivannovii , L . innocua , L . welshimeri , L . seeligeri , L . grayi ) . Second , quantify the heterogeneities observed in the adhesion energies . Two ways were tested for their ability to quantify the heterogeneities . The first heterogeneity index ( HI 1 ) was defined as the ratio of the standard error of mean for a given data set to the maximum standard error of mean quantified for all sets of data that belong to a certain treatment . The second heterogeneity index ( HI 2 ) was defined as the ratio of the standard deviation for a given data set to the maximum standard deviation quantified for all sets of data that belong to a certain treatment . The third goal of Chapter three was to test for the presence of a relationship between bacterial virulence estimated 9 by LD50 and bacterial adherence estimated by femto - Joule energies and the heterogeneity measures developed above . I hypothesized that heterogeneities in bacterial surface biopolymers can be correlated with bacterial adherence and virulence . This part of my thesis suggested that spatial variations on the cell surface are not important in quantifying adhesion energies between bacterial cells and inert surfaces . In comparison , spatial variations in the adhesion energies were evident between cells that belonged to a single strain but cultured separately . The results of this chapter also indicated that heterogeneities in bacterial adhesion energies can be quantified . The heterogeneity indices defined were found to be well correlated with bacterial macroscopic measures such as virulence . This study is the first in the literature that attempted to quantify heterogeneities in bacterial adhesion energies at four levels . The results of this study are expected to be transferable to other AFM adhesion measurements on microbes , viruses , or mammalian cells . The heterogeneities observed in the adhesion affinities between the AFM silicon nitride cantilever and the bacterial surface biopolymers reflect more than a distribution in the types of the biopolymers displayed on the bacterial surface . Such heterogeneities further represent possible differences in bacterial surface biopolymer size and conformational properties . In Chapter 4 , I investigate the role of the mechanics of bacterial surface biopolymers as they contribute to the overall mechanics of the bacterial cell as well as to the bacterial cell in vivo 10 virulence . To investigate bacterial cell overall mechanical properties , nano - indentation measurements were performed on bacterial cells that varied in their virulence using a sharp rigid nano - indenter . The data obtained was fit to the Hertz model of contact mechanics to quantify the Young’s modulus of the cell . Two forms of Hertz model were used 51 , 52 . The first form assumes that the bacterial cell has an infinite thickness and the second one takes into account the bacterial thickness and the rigidity of the substrate to which bacteria attach to . In addition to the overall mechanics of the cell , the conformational properties of bacterial surface biopolymers were quantified from stretching single bacterial biopolymers . The force required to stretch biopolymers to a certain distance was fit to entropic - based statistical mechanical random walk formulation models of polymer chain elasticity 53 . This part of my thesis indicated that the virulent L . monocytogenes strains exhibited a more rigid surface at cellular level compared to the avirulent strains . In comparison , the virulent strains exhibited more flexible surface biopolymers compared to the avirulent strains at the molecular level . It is most likely that the flexible surface biopolymers collapse onto the bacterial surface , leading to a more rigid surface overall . In addition to investigating bacterial mechanics and adherence as a function of virulence , I was interested in exploring at the nanoscale how bacterial strains respond to various stress environments , especially chemical stress . Previously , researchers have hypothesized that the high frequency of large outbreaks caused by L . monocytogenes is due to their increased ability to 11 survive and adapt well in harsh environments 32 , 33 , 36 , 42 , 54 , 55 . Researchers also hypothesized that one of the ways bacteria survive by is by attaching well to surfaces 1 . Combined , survival and adherence in harsh environments were further hypothesized to allow bacteria to still be virulent in such conditions 1 , 32 , 42 . While the ability of L . monocytogenes to attach to a wide variety of surfaces and to survive irrespective of the surrounding conditions in vivo and in vitro has been well documented in the literature 6 , 33 , 34 , 55 , 56 , the molecular mechanisms by which bacterial surface biopolymers control the bacterial adhesion to surfaces under various environmental conditions are largely missing . Due to the lack of such fundamental studies , my goal of Chapter 5 of the thesis was to investigate the role of environmental pH conditions on properties and interactions of L . monocytogenes to surfaces . With the use of AFM , the adhesion energies which govern the interactions between a pathogenic strain of L . monocytogenes ( ATCC 51776 ) individual cells grown at various pH conditions ( pH 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 ) and a model surface of silicon nitride in water were quantified . In addition , the surface hydrophobicity of the microbe as a function of the various pH conditions of growth was measured using contact angel measurements . Finally , interaction energies ( called work of adhesion ) of L . monocytogenes calculated from AFM measurement were compared to the work of adhesion values quantified by a thermodynamic - based harmonic mean ( HM ) model from contact angle measurements quantified on L . monocytogenes multilayers of cells grown under variable pH conditions . Our 12 results indicated that the strongest work of adhesion of L . monocytogenes individual cells to silicon nitride in femto - Joule were found for L . monocytogenes cells grown in a brain heart infusion broth ( BHIB ) media adjusted to a pH value of 7 . Contact angle measurements of L . monocytogenes cells grown under all pH conditions tested revealed that the cell surfaces are dominated by hydrophilic groups . When compared , the work of adhesion quantified between silicon nitride and individual L . monocytogenes cells using AFM agreed well in magnitudes and in trends with those estimated from contact angle measurements performed on layers of L . monocytogenes cells . Finally the femto - Joule work of adhesion quantified from AFM measurements are directly correlated with the femto - Joule work of adhesion estimated based on thermodynamic approaches . Such correlation indicates that AFM measurements of bacterial adhesion to inert surfaces using individual cells can be used to predict the macroscale adhesion behavior of multilayers of cells . This systematic approach is the first in the literature that attempted to measure and correlate work of adhesion between inert surfaces and individual or multilayers of cells under similar environmental conditions and for the same bacterial strain . The AFM approach provided here for quantification of adhesion energies between bacteria and inert surfaces can be used to quantify work of adhesion between varieties of surfaces under controlled aqueous environments . 13 1 . 3 Literature Review This dissertation aims at describing the relationship between the properties of bacterial surfaces biopolymers and bacterial cells abilities to survive in various environments , to adhere to inert surfaces and to cause virulence . To achieve our goal , AFM was mainly used to measure interaction forces between surface biopolymers of Listeria bacterial cells that varied in their virulence or grown at different environmental conditions and a model surface of silicon nitride in water . Silicon nitride was chosen as our model inert surface because they are characterized by a surface charge similar to each of soil and glass 25 . Both soil and glass are substrates to which L . monocytogenes frequently attaches to in nature 57 and during food processing 58 . We chose to perform our measurements in water because water is the main solvent used in the food processing industries and the main solvent used in preparing foods 59 . In addition to quantifying the adhesion strengths between bacteria and inert surfaces , the elastic properties of bacterial cells and biopolymers were estimated from modeling various parts of the AFM force measurements . Statistical tools were always used to quantify whether certain parameters such as adhesion force and mechanical properties were different among various treatments investigated . Basic definitions of terms used in the thesis , background on model bacteria used and basis of theoretical models applied are given below . 14 1 . 3 . 1 The Genus Listeria The genus Listeria is classified into six main species by means of numerical taxonomic and chemical studies , as well as recent DNA homology and 16S rRNA cataloging studies 6 , 24 . Those species are L . monocytogenes , L . ivanovii , L . innocua , L . seeligeri , L . welshimeri and L . grayi 24 . All Listeria species are Gram - positive , non - spore - forming , usually non - capsulated , facultatively anaerobic rods and wide spread in the environment 6 , 15 , 24 . The optimum temperature of growth is between 30 o C and 37 o C . However , Listeria growth can still get detected at 4 o C within a few days 24 . When grown at temperatures between 20 o C and 28 o C , Listeria species are motile by means of flagella , but at 37 o C they markedly reduce the production of their flagella 6 , 24 . Among the genus Listeria , L . monocytogenes is the species most often implicated with human listeriosis and isolated from infected individuals and contaminated RTE ( ready to eat ) foods 60 . Listeria species are divided on the basis of two lines of descent , L . monocytogenes and its closely related five species 24 . Although L . monocytogenes is the Listeria species known as a significant human and animal pathogen , L . ivanovii and L . seeligeri are occasionally associated with human infections 6 , 24 . L . ivanovii is nevertheless mainly responsible for abortion in sheep 24 . Although associated with human infections , L . seeligeri is generally classified as a non - pathogenic Listeria species 24 . In general , Listeria strains can be classified according to their 15 surface molecules such as somatic ( O ) and flagellar ( H ) antigens , called serotypes 6 , 24 . Thirteen serotypes are known for L . monocytogenes : 1 / 2a , 1 / 2b . , 1 / 2c , 3a , 3b , 3c , 4a , 4ab , 4b , 4c , 4d , 4e and 7 6 , 24 . Although stereotyping antigens are shared among Listeria species , non L . monocytogenes species fall in unique or limited numbers of serotypes . For example , L . grayi do not share stereotyping antigens from all other Listeria species 24 . L . ivanovii strains are all serovars 5 , while L . innocua , L . seeligeri and L . welshimeri are within serovars 5 , 6a and 6b 24 . Moreover , genomics studies indicated that L . monocytogenes genome with respect to virulence encoded exceptionally large number of surface proteins ( 4 . 7 % of whole genome ) 61 . Proteomics studies in literature detailed that a total of 30 protein species were unequivocally identified in cell wall extracts between L . monocytogenes EGD - e ( 19 proteins ) and L . innocua CLIP11262 ( 11 proteins ) 24 . 1 . 3 . 1 . 1 Listeria monocytogenes L . monocytogenes was first recognized as Bacterium monocytogenes causing listeriosis in laboratory rabbits and guinea pigs by Murray et al . in 1926 62 . Later , Nyfeldt isolated the bacterium first from an infected human . Pirie renamed the bacterium as current name , Listeria monocytogenes in 1940 6 . In addition to listeriosis , L . monocytogenes was shown to be responsible for sever and fatal infections including encephalitis , meningitis , septicemia and intrauterine 63 . Since periodic listeriosis has been occurred in workers in contact with diseased 16 animals , interest in the L . monocytogenes grew rapidly among food manufacturers and government . L . monocytogenes is currenlty considered among the most resilient food - borne pathogens that are present in the environment 6 . L . monocytogenes is a Gram - positive , non - spore forming , facultative intracellular bacterium that is widely distributed in nature and contaminates read - to - eat ( RTE ) foods 64 . L . monocytogenes is well characterized by their ability to survive in wide range of environmental conditions such as temperature , pH and ionic concentrations 6 , 28 , 37 - 39 . For example , L . monocytogenes survived in commercial cheese brine ( 23 . 8 % NaCl , pH 4 . 9 ) stored at 4 o C for 259 days 65 . L . monocytogenes exhibits motility below 30 o C via flagella , but at temperatures above 30 o C such as those in vivo , they lose their motility 28 , 61 , 65 . The isolated cell wall of L . monocytogenes is composed of 20 % lipids , 40 % common amino acids , 6 % amino sugars , 29 % neutral sugars , and 5 % phosphate ( all percentages are on the basis of dry cell mass ) 42 , 66 . Taxonomy - wise , L . monocytogenes are divided into 13 serovars known to cause human listeriosis by serological types on the basis of somatic and flagellar antigens 24 . From the serovars of L . monocytogenes , only three antigenic groups ½a , ½b , and 4b are the most common serovars causing human listeriosis 67 . 1 . 3 . 2 Bacterial Pathogenicity and Virulence Pathogens are defined as bacteria that result in harmful effects on their host organisms 17 upon living on or in that host 7 . Since host and bacteria modify their activities and functions against each other , the relationship between the host and the pathogen is dynamic 7 , 68 . The outcome of the host and pathogen relationship depends on the pathogenicity of bacteria , ability of bacteria to produce diseases in the host and depends on the resistance or susceptibility of the host to the bacterium 7 , 68 . Virulence is a quantitative measure of bacterial pathogenicity and often refers to the relative ability of bacteria to cause diseases 7 . Bacterial virulence can be determined by quantifying the invasiveness of the pathogen in a host of interest and by pathogen toxigenicity 7 . Pathogens invade hosts using virulence factors . Virulence factors are molecules ( proteins or toxins ) expressed by pathogens to enable the pathogen to do one or more of the following four functions . First , allow the pathogen to adhere to the host cells . Second , allow the pathogen to evade the immune system of the host or inhibit the immune system of the host . Third , allow the pathogen to enter and exit from host cells . Finally , allow the pathogen to obtain nutrition from the host 68 . In vivo virulence is usually expressed as the bacterial dose ( number of bacterial cells ) inflicting a pathological response on a small animal within a given period of time 43 , 69 . It is common to quantify virulence by the bacterial lethal dose required to kill 50 % of animals in a given study ( LD50 ) . Usually virulence is quantified using mice . Generally , mice that belong to a certain age group are allowed to acclimatize for 1 week . Mice are then inoculated with 0 . 1 ml 18 aliquots of appropriate dilutions of bacteria . Two control mice groups are treated in parallel as well . One group is generally inoculated with 0 . 1 ml sterile saline and one group is not injected at all . After two weeks approximately , all surviving mice are euthanized and one mouse per group is necropsied and cultured from the spleen for bacterial growth . The LD50 for each strain is then calculated . Besides mice , chicken embryos 70 and human carcinoma cells are also used to quantify virulence 71 . Chicken embryos are generally incubated for a week at 37°C with high humidity for 7 days prior to infection with bacterial pathogens . Eggs are then examined in order to discard those that lacked a viable embryo . A 100 µl of bacterial inoculum is then injected under the chorioallantoic membrane through a small window that is made in the air sac end of an egg . Embryos are frequently checked for the presence of an intact blood network , the sign for live embryos . Embryos that died within 24 hours of inoculation are generally assumed to have suffered lethal trauma during the inoculation 70 . Carcinoma cell lines are generally inoculated with bacterial suspensions adjusted to obtain a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 100 bacteria per cell . Infected cells are further incubated for 18 hours with a buffer medium containing a bacterial biocide to kill extracellular bacteria . At various times during this 18 hours period , cells are washed three times with buffer and lysed by cold distilled water . A viable count of the intracellular bacteria is then performed to quantify virulence . Although the in - vivo tests provide a quantitative measure of virulence , their dependence on experimental animals testing could be 19 prohibitive to investigators due to high costs associated with the experiments . 1 . 3 . 2 . 1 Virulence of L . monocytogenes Consumption of contaminated food by L . monocytogenes can cause infectious diseases such as fatal listeriosis and meningitis 70 , 72 especially in pregnant women , elderly and immuno - compromised patients . Although the main steps in the route to infection are still unclear , the association of L . monocytogenes with several large food borne outbreaks strongly suggests that the contaminated food is the primary source of the infection 6 . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , L . monocytogenes is responsible for approximately 2 , 500 illnesses and 500 deaths , and is the leading cause of pathogen - related food - borne recalls in the United States 73 . As a result of the associated high mortality rate among those at risk , the U . S . Department of Agriculture’s and the U . S . Food and Drug Administration established zero tolerance policies for the L . monocytogenes in RTE foods 74 . Over the years many factors have been proposed to affect the pathogenicity of L . monocytogenes including surface components and growth environmental conditions 6 , 75 . Recently , research studies identified several cell - surface proteins of L . monocytogenes that are largely involved in the attachment of the bacterium to host cell surfaces and further in the invasion of host cells by the bacterium . Internalin A ( InlA ) is the first identified surface protein of L . monocytogenes that mediates bacterial internalization by interacting with E - cadherin 20 receptors to cross the intestinal barrier 6 . Both proteins 60 and 104 aid in the attachment of L . monocytogenes to intestinal cells 11 , 12 . listeriolysin - O ( LLO ) mediates the escape of L . monocytogenes from host immunity by perforation of macrophage phagosomes 76 . In addition , the growth of environmental conditions was found to play a role in controlling the virulence and adhesion strengths of L . monocytogenes to surfaces 32 , 42 . For example , environmental pH was shown to regulate the expression and activity of virulence and adhesive factors in L . monocytogenes such as hemolysin , listeriolysin - O ( LLO ) , P60 and flagellin 32 , 42 . Another example is given by the fact that the virulence of L . monocytogenes EGD grown under refrigeration temperature ( 4 o C ) increased in intravenously inoculated mice 75 . These studies indicate that the virulence of L . monocytogenes might be controlled by extrinsic factors such as environmental conditions . 1 . 3 . 3 Measurements of Bacterial Interactions and Properties Bacterial interactions and properties have an important role in many aspects of bacteriology 50 . Bacterial properties vary significantly during the bacterial life cycle 13 , 77 . Such variations lead to significant differences in the bacterial behaviors as a function of growth 13 , 77 . Bacterial interactions to other surfaces are important to bacterial survival in harsh environments , to controlling the initial phases of bacterial infections 50 and to the formation of bacterial biofilms . Bacterial interactions and properties are mediated by diverse network of bacterial 21 surface molecules or biopolymers such as exopolysaccharides , proteins , lipopolysaccharides , lipoteichoic acids , lectins , pili and fimbriae 78 , 79 . The ratios of these constituents on the bacterial surface largely depends on the bacterial genus and on the growth and environmental conditions used to grow bacteria 78 , 79 . The high diversity in types of bacterial surface biopolymers generally results in difficult to predict bacterial interactions and properties . Over the years , traditional approaches such as microscopy , microbiology , immunology and molecular biology approaches have been used to identify surface constituents of bacteria , to image structure of bacterial cell wall and to measure bacterial interactions to surfaces 79 . Although such approaches are useful , they can not be used to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of bacterial adhesion to surfaces . The ability of AFM to quantify bacterial properties such as bacterial size , roughness and mechanics and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of bacterial adhesion to surfaces in real time and in real environments gives it an edge over the traditional biological macroscopic techniques . In addition , the ability of AFM to observe the dynamic response of bacteria to certain environments with a sub - nanoscale resolution is fascinating 80 . The use of AFM to quantify bacterial properties and interactions will be discussed in the sections below . 1 . 3 . 3 . 1 AFM Quantification of Bacterial Adhesion Forces to Surfaces When the AFM tip is brought into contact with a bacterial cell , biopolymers from the 22 bacterial surface will physically adsorb to the AFM tip 46 . As the AFM tip is retracted away from the bacterial surface , the bacterial surface biopolymer start to fall off the AFM tip . The force required to break the biopolymers off the AFM tip is called the pull - off force and is equivalent to the adhesion force and represents the sum of all interaction forces between the bacterial surface biopolymers and the AFM cantilever 26 , 46 , 81 . Figure 1 . 1A shows an example on a retractions curve that consists of multiple peaks with arrows indicating individual adhesion events . Each peak in the retraction curve has two coordinates ( pull - off distance , pull - off force ) . The pull - off distance indicates the location at which the cantilever contacted a bacterial surface biopolymer chain or multiple chains . In AFM measurements , bacterial adhesion forces generally represent the interactions between many bacterial surface biopolymers and the AFM tip . This is mainly due to the high grafting density of bacterial surface biopolymers contacting the AFM tip 25 , 82 . The pull - off force indicates the magnitude of force necessary to separate the bacterial biopolymers from the cantilever surface . The adhesion force is equal to the pull - off force in magnitude and opposite in sign 46 . The ability of AFM to quantify the interaction forces between a wide array of Gram - negative and Gram - positive bacteria , and various inert and biotic surfaces were explored by many investigators in the literature 25 , 27 , 47 , 77 , 79 , 83 - 87 . The inert surfaces investigated are silicon nitride , silicon rubber , mineral surfaces , mica , glass , polystyrene and Teflon 25 , 27 , 77 , 79 , 84 - 87 . The 23 biotic surfaces investigated are lectin concanavalin A and saliva - coated enamel 47 , 83 . Several example studies which used the AFM to quantify bacterial adhesion forces to surfaces are discussed below . First , studies in the literature that have looked at how bacteria adapt to environmental stress at the nanoscale will be discussed . For example , an increase in the nanoscale forces measured between Pseudomonas putida KT2442 and silicon nitride cantilevers was reported as the ionic strength of the environment increased from that of pure water to 1 M KCl 47 . Another example is given by Chandraprabha et al . , the adhesion forces between Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and silicon nitride were measured in a range of pH solutions that varied from pH 2 . 2 to pH 7 . 9 . The adhesion force decreased as the pH of solution increased , of which maximum adhesion was observed at pH 2 . 2 88 . Second , studies that quantified bacterial interaction to biotic surfaces will be discussed . For example , the strength of the specific interactions of immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) and protein A ( PA ) on the surface of live Staphylococcus aureu s bacteria was quantified in terms of adhesion forces . The authors indicated that the strength of the lignad - receptor specific bond is 64 ± 28 pN , usually rupturing at a distance of 74 ± 40 nm 89 . Another example is given by van der Mei et al . , adhesion forces were measured as a function of surface delay time between a saliva - coated enamel and Streptococcus mitis , S . sanguinis , S . sobrinus and S . mutans 83 . For all four Streptococcus strains , the streptococcal adhesion forces increased from about 0 . 7 nN to 10 . 3 nN respectively when the contact time 24 between cell surfaces and salivary films on enamel was increased from 0 to 120 sec . In addition , both the initial and final adhesion forces were stronger for initial colonizers of tooth surfaces ( S . mitis , S . sanguinis ) than for later , more cariogenic , strains ( S . sobrinus , S . mutans ) 83 . Third , studies that investigated the interactions between bacteria and materials that are not commonly used in manufacturing AFM probes are discussed . For example , interaction forces measured between Candida parapsilosis , immobilized on an AFM cantilever , and a silicon rubber biomaterial or Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm were quantified in MES [ 2 - ( N - Morpholino ) ethanesulfonic Acid ] buffer . The authors showed that attractive interactions of C . parapsilosis cells with silicon rubber substrate ( 4 . 3 ± 0 . 25 nN ) were stronger than those with the P . aeruginosa biofilm 85 . Another example is given by Ong et al . , interaction forces were measured between E . coli immobilized tip and mica , glass , hydrophilic glass , hydrophobic glass , polystyrene and Teflon ( listed according to increasing order of hydrophobicity ) in Tris buffer . The authors showed that the surface hydrophobicity of the material enhanced the strengths of bacterial adhesion to the surface 83 . Finally , studies that quantified the interactions between bacteria and inert surfaces are discussed . For example , interaction forces between nine S . mitis strains and silicone nitride AFM tip were examined in deionized water ( DI water ) or in a 0 . 1 M KCl . Although two of S . mitis strains showed opposite adhesion trends compared to other strains , the adhesion forces of S . mitis tended to be slightly stronger in 0 . 1 M KCl than in DI water 90 . In 25 addition , the adhesion forces of S . mitis strains were inversely correlated with the bacterial water contact angles . The authors suggested that the high hydrophobicity of S . mitis surfaces in water could stimulate dehydration of the relatively hydrophilic silicone nitride AFM tips , of which dehydration would be a driving force for adhesion 90 . Another example is given by Abu - Lail et al . , adhesion forces between native or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) - treated E . coli JM109 and silicon nitride AFM tip were quantified in DI water to evaluate the role of lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) in controlling the bacterial adhesion to inert surface 25 . After EDTA treatment , ~ 80 % of LPS were removed from the surface of E . coli . Such reduction in the bacterial surface LPS resulted in approximately 81 % reduced adhesion forces to the silicon nitride model inert surface compared to the native E . coli 25 . Many other examples can be found in the literature . For more information , please refer to these reviews 79 , 91 - 95 . 1 . 3 . 3 . 2 AFM Quantification of Bacterial Adhesion Energies to Surfaces The second methodology that could potentially be employed to quantify bacterial interactions to surfaces using AFM is to compute the bacterial adhesion energy measured between bacterial surface biopolymers and the AFM tip 94 , 96 . Although rarely reported in the literature 96 , the use of adhesion energy as a measure of bacterial interactions offers a unique and comprehensive alternative way to the use of nanoscale adhesion forces for the following two reasons . First , the criterion used to compute bacterial adhesion energy is well defined and thus 26 can be generalized between all AFM users . As a result of such uniform criterion , the adhesion energy analysis can be easily automated and its results can be compared among microbes . Second , the adhesion energy represents a comprehensive measure of all the interactions measured between the bacterial surface biopolymers and the surface of interest . For example , although it is difficult to determine the adhesion forces for some areas on the distance - force profile shown in Figure 1 . 1B and C ( circled area ) , the adhesion energy can be easily computed to cover the entire interactions regime . 27 Figure 1 . 1 . Examples on retraction curves measured between AFM silicon nitride cantilevers and L . monocytogenes 51776 cells in water . Figure ( A ) shows an example on a retraction curve where all pull - off force peaks could be easily identified . Black arrows 28 indicate each peak on the curve . Figures ( B ) and ( C ) , however , show examples on retraction curves where it is difficult to identify the peaks corresponding to interaction forces as marked by black circles . In all Figures , the gray shadowed areas represent the work of adhesion or adhesion energy . The grey arrows at the top of curve in Figure ( A ) indicate the bounds of integration where the adhesion energy was computed using equations 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 . The adhesion energy can be computed as the area under the retraction curve with the baseline taken at zero force ( grey shaded areas in Figures 1 . 1A , B and C ) . In general , force and energy are correlated such as 96 : ∫ − = 2 1 h h Fdh E ( 1 . 1 ) where E is the adhesion energy , F is the pull - off force , and h is the separation distance between the bacteria and the surface . The negative sign was used to convert pull - off forces into adhesion forces . To calculate the adhesion energy , the integral in equation 1 . 1 is evaluated using the Trapezoidal rule ( equation 1 . 2 ) 97 . ) ] ( 2 ) ( ) ( [ 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 n h h k h F h F h F n h h Fdh n k h h − + + + − ≈ ∑ ∫ − = ( 1 . 2 ) In equation 1 . 2 , 1 h and 2 h were taken as the first and last distance points at which the retraction curve crosses the zero force axis ( Figure 1 . 1A ) , n was equal to the number of data points collected per retraction force curve in the integral interval and varied from one curve to another . In computing the integral in equation 1 . 2 , a uniform grid is always used 98 . 29 Among the examples of literature studies used to quantify bacterial interactions in terms of bacterial energy , two are discussed below . First , AFM nonspecific interactions measured between a Staphylococcus aureus bacterium and each of two materials ( silica and polystyrene ) in an electrolyte solution were quantified in terms of both adhesion forces and adhesion energies . The authors showed that the strength of the adhesion bond was 38 ± 4 pN and 52 ± 9 pN for glass and polystyrene , respectively . Likewise , the average energies necessary to completely separate S . aureus from glass or polystyrene were 1 . 5 ×10 − 18 J and 2 . 3 ×10 − 18 J , respectively . Both nanoscale adhesion forces and attoscale adhesion energies predicted larger interactions strengths between S . aureus and polystyrene compared to those with glass 96 . Second , interactions between Shewanella oneidensis and goethite ( - FeOOH ) were quantified under aerobic and anaerobic solutions 98 . The authors showed that energy values [ in attojoules ( 10 - 18 joules ) ] measured between S . oneidensis and goethite under anaerobic conditions were two to five times compared to those measured under aerobic conditions . The higher adhesion strengths found under the anaerobic conditions were attributed to the expected effects of electrons transferred from the bacterium to the mineral under anaerobic conditions 96 . 1 . 3 . 3 . 3 AFM Quantification of Bacterial Cells’ Elasticity The overall nanomechanical properties of bacterial cells can be quantified using AFM nanoindentation - force measurements . Since the AFM tip is much more rigid ( Young’s modulus 30 > 30 GPa ) 99 compared to the bacterial samples ( Young’s modulus < 200 MPa ) 23 , 51 , it can be used as an indenter . When a force ; usually in the nN range , is applied on the bacterial surface using the AFM tip as an indenter , the indenter pushes the bacterial surface biopolymer brush to a certain distance called the indentation distance ; usually measured in nm . The force applied to the indenter has no effect on the indenter used 23 , 51 , 100 . When theoretical models such as the Hertz model of contact mechanics are applied to the recorded nanoindentation - force curves , the bacterial cell Young’s modulus of elasticity can be estimated as will be discussed later 52 , 101 . The Young’s modulus also called as the elastic modulus is specific for the material under load and has the dimensions of force per unit surface area , pressure units . Several examples on studies from the literature that used the AFM nanoindentation - force measurements to evaluate the Young’s modulus of bacterial cells are discussed below . The elastic moduli of E . coli JM109 cells were estimated in three different polar solvents . The authors found that the Young’s modulus of bacteria was greatest in the least polar solvent , with values of 182 ± 34 . 6 , 12 . 8 ± 0 . 1 , 0 . 8 ± 0 . 3 MPa in methanol , water , and formamide , respectively . Similarly , Young’s moduli of Shewanella putrefaciens CIP 8040 measured in 0 . 1 M KNO 3 solution at two pH values ( 4 and 10 ) using a silicon nitride cantilever as an indenter were found to be 210 and 37 kPa , respectively 51 . Another example is given by measurements of the elastic modulus of Staphylococcus aureus before and after treatment with chitooligosaccharide in air 23 . The 31 nanoindentation - force measurements revealed a reduction in cell wall stiffness after chitooligosaccharide treatment from 95 . 4 ± 2 . 6 MPa to 88 . 2 ± 5 . 5 MPa . 1 . 3 . 3 . 4 AFM Quantification of the Elasticity of Bacterial Surface Biopolymers Elastic properties of biopolymers can be estimated by applying biopolymer stretching models to the force - extension curves obtained by AFM during the extension of a biological polymer 102 . At zero force , polymer chains exist in coiled state to maximize their conformational freedom ( entropy ) . Extension of a relaxed chain generates an opposing force that reduces the chain entropy 53 . This entropic elasticity of bacterial surface biopolymers can be described using statistical thermodynamic polymer elasticity models in terms of Kuhn length from freely joint chain ( FJC ) model ( Figure 1 . 2A ) or persistence length from worm like chain ( WLC ) model ( Figure 1 . 2B ) 46 , 103 . 32 ( A ) ( B ) D L k1 L k2 L k3 L kn L kn - 1 L kn - 2 D L p1 L p2 ( A ) ( B ) D L k1 L k2 L k3 L kn L kn - 1 L kn - 2 D L p1 L p2 Figure 1 . 2 . Schematics show the different elastic models of polymers stretching . Figure ( A ) shows a freely jointed chain ( FJC ) and Figure ( B ) shows a wormlike chain ( WLC ) . In the schematics , D is the stretching length in solvent and the local stiffnesses of the chains are represented by the Kuhn length ( L k ) in FJC model and the persistence length ( L p ) in WLC model . Using AFM to quantify the elasticity of bacterial surface biopolymers has been well documented in the literature . For example , the persistence length of the surface biopolymers of Pseudomonas putida KT2442 in water spanned a range of 0 . 154 nm to 0 . 28 nm indicating that bacterial surface polymers are very flexible 26 , 46 . In another study , differences in the conformational properties of the surface polysaccharides of a wild type Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus rhamnosus mutant CMPG5413 impaired in adherence , biofilm formation and polysaccharide production 47 were probed in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) . 33 The results indicated that the polysaccharides of the CMPG5413 mutant were approximately twice as rigid as the wild - type strain polysaccharides with 1 . 7 ± 0 . 3 nm of Kuhn length . In a third study , the elasticity of surface biopolymers on Sacchrmoyces cerevisiae and S . carlsbergensis were quantified using a lectin - modified tip in sodium acetate buffered solution ( pH 4 . 75 ) 104 . The S . carlsbergensis showed typical segment length values for its surface polysaccharides ( 0 . 5 nm ) with rupture distance of ~ 100 nm while the S . cerevisiae showed relatively longer persistence lengths ( ~ 0 . 56 nm ) with longer rupture distance of ~ 400 nm . The authors concluded that only mannan chains were stretched on S . carlsbergensis , while the entire mannoproteins were stretched on S . cerevisia 104 . 1 . 3 . 3 . 5 AFM Quantification of the Heterogeneity in Bacterial Surface Biopolymers It is not surprising to observe large standard deviations when measuring adhesion forces between bacterial surface biopolymers and an AFM tip . The large standard deviations observed in AFM measurements mainly reflect the differences in the molecular weights , chemical natures , elasticity and spatial charge distributions of bacterial surface biopolymers 92 . The observed heterogeneities thus indicate more than a distribution in the types of the biopolymers displayed on the bacterial surface . Heterogeneities in the adhesion of bacterial surface lipopolysaccharides to an inert surface were well documented in the literature compared to adhesion of pure polysaccharides to model inert surfaces 92 . The adhesion forces between surface biopolymers of 34 Pseudomonas putida KT2442 and silicon nitride AFM tip were probed in DI water . The average adhesion force was 460 ± 1300 pN and the Kuhn length of the polysaccharides spanned a range from 0 . 154 to 0 . 45 nm 46 . In addition to AFM experiments , a size exclusion chromatography study of freeze dried P . putida KT 2442 biopolymers has shown broad spectrum of peaks indicating that the bacterial surface biopolymers span a range of molecular weight 46 . In comparison , AFM stretching of pure dextran polysaccharides resulted in 100 ± 20 pN adhesion force to the silicon nitride cantilever and a Kuhn length of 0 . 6 ± 0 . 05 nm 92 . The adhesion forces quantified and the Kuhn lengths estimated for the bacterial polysaccharides indicates large heterogeneities compared to the values obtained for the pure dextran polysaccharides probed by AFM in DI water . 1 . 3 . 4 Models Used to Quantify Bacterial Properties and Interactions 1 . 3 . 4 . 1 Hertz Model of Contact Mechanics Quantitative information on bacterial elasticity can be estimated from modeling the measured force - indentation data using both the classic Hertz ( Figure 1 . 3A ) and the modified Hertz ( Figure 1 . 3B ) models of contact mechanics 46 , 52 . Hertz proposed the simplest force law ( classic Hertz model ) to approximate the actual sphere - plane interactions under the following assumptions 51 , 52 , 100 , 105 , 106 . The contact surface is finite in thickness compared to the sphere radii and of which contact surface is elastic and non - adhesive . Although adhesive forces are 35 present at all compressive contact loads , the adhesive component may be neglected when the load is sufficiently high compared to attraction 106 . The classic Hertz model , therefore , describes the indentation of a non - deformable sphere indenter ( the AFM silicon nitride tip ) into an infinitely deformable elastic half space ( the bacterial surface ) . Figure 1 . 3 . Schematics of the indentation experiments using ( A ) classic Hertz model and ( B ) modified Hertz model . In the schematics , F is the applied indentation force , δ is the indentation distance in the bacterial cell resulting upon applying a force F on the cell and R is the radius of the indenter ( AFM tip ) . Note that the size of the indenter and the thickness of the bacteria and substrate are drawn not to scale for clarity purposes . The curve is an example on force - indentation data measured on L . monocytogenes 51776 . The dashed grey line is ( A ) classic Hertz model fit to the force - indentation data , while the solid black lines is ( B ) modified Hertz model fit to the data . 36 According to the classic Hertz model , the indentation force ) ( F applied by a non - deformable sphere indenter ( the AFM silicon nitride tip ) required to indent a distance ) ( δ into an infinitely deformable elastic half space ( the bacterial surface ) is given by : 2 / 3 2 / 1 2 ) 1 ( 3 4 δ ν R E F − = ( 1 . 3 ) where E is the Young’s modulus of bacterium , R is the radius of the spherical indenter taken as 40 nm ( the average of manufacturer reported range of values for tip radius ) , and ν is the Poisson ratio of the bacterium 100 or gelatin film 107 taken as 0 . 5 . Young’s modulus of the bacterium is the only fitting parameter in equation 1 . 3 . In comparison , Dimitriadis et al . have developed the modified Hertz model to take into account the effect of finite thickness of the indented sample ( bacterial cell in our case ) by adding a modification to the classic Hertz model described by equation 1 . 3 . The modified Hertz model describes the indentation force ( F ) applied by a non - deformable sphere indenter ( the AFM silicon nitride tip ) and required to indent a distance ( δ ) into a deformable elastic half space ( the bacterial surface ) of a finite thickness by 52 : ⎥⎦ ⎤ ⎢⎣ ⎡ ⎟ ⎟⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎜⎝ ⎛ + + ⎟ ⎟⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎜⎝ ⎛ + − + − × − = 4 0 2 30 4 0 3 0 2 30 3 2 2 0 0 2 / 3 2 / 1 2 5 3 16 15 4 8 4 2 1 ) 1 ( 3 4 χ β π α π α χ β π α π χ π α χ π α δ ν R E F ( 1 . 4 ) where t R / δ χ = , t is the thickness of the bacterial cell , and the constants α 0 and β 0 are 37 functions of the sample Poisson ratio ( v ) and depend on whether or not the sample indented was bonded to the substrate beneath it or not .

The force per unit area between two surfaces , only one of which is coated with polymer , has been modeled following the work of Alexander 108 and de Gennes 109 . This model was further modified by Butt et al . 110 to describe the forces between a spherical AFM tip and a flat surface by integrating the force per unit area over the tip surface . When fit the approach distance - force data ( Figure 1 . 4 ) , the model can be used to estimate the bacterial surface biopolymer brush thickness and the grafting density of the bacterial surface biopolymers . ) / 2 ( 50 23 L h Exp RTL K F B St π − Γ = ( 1 . 7 ) 38 where k B is Boltzmann constant , T is temperature , R is the tip radius taken as reported by the manufacturer ( 40 nm ) , Γ is the grafted polymer density in the brush layer ( m - 2 ) and reflects how much of the surface is covered by polymers , h is the distance between the two surfaces , and L is the equilibrium height of the polymer brush layer 111 .

The two most commonly models used to describe biopolymer chain elasticity are the freely jointed chain ( FJC ) and the wormlike chain ( WLC ) models 46 , 112 . In FJC , the polymer chain is considered as equal , independent and freely rotating segments in any direction . The FJC model takes into account entropic effects only and the local stiffness of the chain represented by the Kuhn length ( L k ) . The force needed to stretch a FJC to a length D is given by 26 : ⎟⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎜⎝⎛ − = − c k B FJC L D L L T k F 1 , ( 1 . 8 ) 7 5 3 1 875 1539 175 297 5 9 3 ⎟⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎜⎝⎛ + ⎟⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎜⎝⎛ + ⎟⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎜⎝⎛ + ⎟⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎜⎝⎛ = − c c c c L D L D L D L D L ( 1 . 9 ) Where k B is the Boltzmann constant , T is absolute temperature , L c is the polymer contour length , D is the stretching length in solvent , L - 1 is the inverse Langevin function . According to WLC , the polymer chain is an intermediate between a rigid rod and a flexible coil and considered to be continuously curved in random directions . The WLC model takes into account the local stiffness of the chain in terms of the persistence length ( L P ) and the long - range flexibility . The force ( F WLC ) required to stretch a WLC chain to a length D is given by 40 46 : ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦⎤ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣⎡ − ⎟⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎜⎝⎛ − + − = 4 1 1 4 1 2 c c p B WLC L D L D L T k F ( 1 . 10 ) Where k B is the Boltzmann constant , T is absolute temperature , L c is the biopolymer contour length taken as the total length of the polymer chain . The WLC model is usually applied to a portion of the retraction data 26 . While both models can predict the entropic biopolymer elasticity , the FJC model is preferred for studying polysaccharides’ elasticities and the WLC model is preferred for studying the elasticities of stiffer biopolymers such as proteins and DNA 26 , 53 , 113 , 114 . However , irrespective of the model used to quantify biopolymer elasticity , both models predict similar biopolymer elasticities . The Kuhn length estimated by the FJC is usually twice that of the persistence length estimated for the same chain using the WLC 53 . Comparison between the measured force data and the elastic models allows us to estimate the elasticity of bacterial surface biopolymers . 1 . 3 . 5 Statistical Analysis of AFM data With no exception , AFM studies of nanoscale bacterial adhesion to surfaces always demonstrate large variations as evident from large standard deviations in the quantified mean of 41 the adhesion force for any data set 46 , 112 . Such range of adhesion affinities and magnitudes is not surprising because bacterial surfaces are known to comprise many types of biopolymers . One way to understand therefore any given set of data and whether statistical significant variations are present among certain treatments is to use statistical tools . First , the distributions in the adhesion forces quantified between bacteria and surfaces under certain environmental conditions can be fit to dynamic peak function model to quantify the most probable adhesion event in the distribution . For example , it have shown previously that both normal and Gamma distribution functions were capable of describing the distribution of adhesion affinities measured between lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) macromolecules of E . coli JM109 and the AFM tip 25 . Other statistical models such as bimodal 25 , 46 , normal 115 , log - normal 116 , and Poisson distribution 117 can also be used to describe the heterogeneity in nanoscale bacterial adhesion measurements and to minimize the effect of biopolymer heterogeneity on predicting bacterial adhesion to surfaces . Second , statistical information and statistical analysis are essential for proper analysis and interpretation of experimental results , explanations of variations in the experimental data , or prediction of trends of experimental data 118 . Examples on the statistical measures used to represent a given data set of bacterial interactions with surfaces are the mean , mode , standard deviation of the mean , range , median and the standard error of the mean . The mean , median and 42 mode are all estimates to find middle of a set of data . The standard deviation is the average distance between the actual data and the mean . The standard error of the mean is the standard deviation of the sample mean estimate of a population mean . In addition , the ability of theoretical models to fit the experimental data obtained by AFM is often judged by the value of the coefficient of correlation or coefficient of determination ( r 2 ) . r 2 describes the proportion of variability in a data set that is accounted for by the statistical model . It provides a measure of how well future outcomes are likely to be predicted by the model . Mathematically , r 2 is defined as the ratio of the sum of squares of the differences between actual values ( i y ) and values predicted by theoretical models ( i f ) called as the residual sum of squares to the sum of squares of the differences between actual values ( i y ) and the mean of the actual values ( y ) , proportional to the data variance . ∑ ∑ − − = i i i i i y y f y r 2 2 2 ) ( ) ( ( 1 . 11 ) Finally , statistical analysis is often used in comparative studies for proper interpretation of the experimental results . For example , we use pair - wise multiple comparison tests to determine if the adhesion strength is different among different virulent strains investigated or to compare a certain parameter across all strains tested . The non - parametric group comparisons Dunn’s ranks test available in Sigma Stat 2 . 03 ( Jandel Scientific ) is usually applied to the data . 43 1 . 4 Organization of the Dissertation This dissertation represents manuscripts that I have written during the course of my Ph . D . Chapter 2 is a manuscript that has been published in Colloids and Surfaces B : Biointerfaces 73 , 237 – 243 ( 2009 ) , entitled “A Correlation between the Virulence and the Adhesion of Listeria monocytogenes to Silicon Nitride : an Atomic Force Microscopy Study” by B . - J . Park , T . Haines and N . I . Abu - Lail . My goal during this study was to improve our understanding of the relationship between the nanoscale adhesion of L . monocytogenes to a model inert surface of silicon nitride and the microbe’s pathogenicity . To investigate this relationship , we measured the nanoscale adhesion of eight L . monocytogenes strains that vary in their virulence level to a model inert surface of silicon nitride using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . Nanoscale adhesion forces were then correlated with in vivo virulence measurements of the same strains performed in mice 43 . We showed that AFM was capable of distinguishing nanoscale adhesion strengths between the eight L . monocytogenes strains that varied in their virulence and silicon nitride . In addition , our results suggested the presence of a logarithmic relationship between L . monocytogenes virulence represented by the 50 % lethal dose of mice and their nanoscale adhesion to silicon nitride . Such relationship can be used as a design criterion to develop better tools that can be used in distinguishing virulent and avirulent L . monocytogenes cells . The stronger adhesion observed for the higher virulence strains might be a way for virulent strains to survive better in the 44 environment . Finally , the molecular approach taken in investigating the relationship between L . monocytogenes adhesion and virulence is a new research methodology that was proven to have a high resolution in quantifying nanoscale attachment differences among various strains tested and thus can lead to a better fundamental understanding of the bacterial adhesion and virulence relationships . I performed all the experiments and analyzed the data with an undergraduate student Travis Haines . The manuscript is written by me and Dr . Nehal I . Abu - Lail . Chapter 3 is entitled “Heterogeneities in the adhesion energies measured between pathogenic and non - pathogenic Listeria and silicon nitride probed using atomic force microscopy” by B . - J . Park and N . I . Abu - Lail . This chapter is to be submitted soon to the journal of Advanced Microscopy Research . My first goal during this study was to quantify the adhesion energies that govern the interactions between Listeria and a model surface of silicon nitride in water at four different cellular levels . These levels were cellular , strain , species and genus levels as discussed before . My second goal was to investigate the heterogeneities in bacterial adhesion energies using two indices based on standard deviation and standard error of mean . My third goal was to test for the presence of a relationship between bacterial virulence estimated by lethal dose required to kill 50 % of mice in a study ( LD50 ) and bacterial adherence estimated by femto - Joule energies and the heterogeneity measures defined above . Our results indicated that the heterogeneity indices increased as the adhesion energy of a particular cell 45 increased . At the species level , the adhesion energies quantified between cells that belonged to the L . monocytogenes species but varied in the strain type from avirulent to virulent strains and silicon nitride correlated linearly with both heterogeneity indices used . The adhesion energies and the heterogeneity indices correlated logarithmically as well with the LD50 ; an indicator of strain in vivo virulence . Our results thus indicate that as the virulence of L . monocytogenes strains increases , their adhesion energies and heterogeneities increase as well . Finally , at the species level , our results clearly indicate that pathogenic Listeria species are more heterogeneous compared to the non - pathogenic species of Listeria . To our knowledge , this is the first study that attempted to quantify heterogeneities in AFM adhesion energy measurements on cells . The methodology introduced here will be applicable to nanoscale heterogeneity investigations of other types of bacteria , viruses and mammalian cells . I designed the experiments for this study in conjunction with Dr . Nehal I . Abu - Lail and performed the experiments and analyzed the data with Dr . Nehal I . Abu - Lail . The manuscript is written by Dr . Nehal I . Abu - Lail and me . Chapter 4 is a manuscript that has been published in Soft Matter , 6 , 3898 - 3909 ( 2010 ) entitled “Variations in the Nanomechanical Properties of Virulent and Avirulent Listeria monocytogenes ” by B . - J . Park and N . I . Abu - Lail . My goal during this study was to investigate the role of the mechanics of bacterial surface biopolymers as they contribute to the overall mechanics of the bacterial cell as well as to the bacterial cell in vivo virulence . To investigate 46 bacterial cell overall mechanical properties , nano - indentation measurements were performed on bacterial cells that varied in their virulence using a sharp rigid nano - indenter . In addition , the crucial role played by bacterial surface biopolymers in bacterial elasticity was investigated . Understanding the elasticity of bacterial cells is challenging due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the bacterial cell wall composition . Motivated by this challenge , we combined existing models of cellular elasticity with insights from single molecule biophysics to shed the light in a comprehensive manner on Gram - positive bacterial cell elasticity . Our results indicated that the virulent L . monocytogenes strains exhibited a more rigid surface at cellular level compared to the avirulent strains as indicated by the higher Young’s moduli values estimated using the classic and modified Hertz models . At the molecular level however , the virulent strains exhibited more flexible surface biopolymers compared to the avirulent strains . Finally , when repulsive steric forces measured between the AFM tip and the bacterial surface biopolymers of L . monocytogenes were modeled by steric repulsion model , biopolymer brushes of virulent strains were longer and more crowded with surface molecules compared to those of avirulent strains’ . Applying scaling relations developed for grafted polyelectrolytes to our experimental data implied that the biopolymer brushes of L . monocytogenes strains investigated are charged . Collectively , our observations indicated that the conformational properties of the bacterial surface biopolymers and their surface densities and charge played an important role in 47 controlling the overall bacterial cell elasticity . In addition , our data suggested possible differences in the nanomechanical properties of virulent and avirulent strains of L . monocytogenes . I performed the experiments and analyzed the data . This manuscript is written by me and edited by Dr . Nehal I . Abu - Lail . Chapter 5 is entitled “The Role of the pH Conditions of Growth on the Bioadhesion of Individual and Lawns of Pathogenic L . monocytogenes Cells” by B . - J . Park and N . I . Abu - Lail . This manuscript is ready to be submitted to the Journal of Colloid and Interface Science . My goal during this study was to investigate the role of the environmental pH conditions in controlling the in vitro adhesion of L . monocytogenes to inert surfaces . To investigate how variations in pH conditions of growth affect L . monocytogenes properties and adhesion to a model inert surface , adhesion energies ( called work of adhesion ) governing the interactions of pathogenic individual L . monocytogenes cells grown under variable pH conditions ( pH 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 ) and a model inert surface of silicon nitride in water were quantified by AFM . Similarly , contact angles measurements were used to quantify the surface tensions of multilayers of bacterial cells grown as described above . The work of adhesion governing the interactions between L . monocytogenes multilayers of cells and silicon nitride in water were calculated using the thermodynamic properties of bacteria , substrate and the medium estimated using the contact angle measurements . Finally the work of adhesion quantified using individual cells or 48 multilayers of cells were compared . Our results using both approaches indicated that the strongest work of adhesion that bind L . monocytogenes to silicon nitride were found for L . monocytogenes cells grown in a media adjusted to a pH value of 7 . When compared , the work of adhesion quantified between silicon nitride and individual L . monocytogenes cells using AFM agreed well in magnitudes and in trends with those estimated from contact angle measurements performed on layers of L . monocytogenes cells . The AFM approach provided here for quantification of work of adhesion between bacteria and inert surfaces can be used to quantify work of adhesion between varieties of surfaces under controlled aqueous environments . I designed the experiments for this study in conjunction with Dr . Nehal I . Abu - Lail and performed the experiments and analyzed the data . This manuscript is written by me and edited by Dr . Nehal I . Abu - Lail . Finally , I summarized my work and the main conclusions as well as recommendations for future studies in Chapter 6 . 49 1 . 5 . References 1 . An , Y . H . ; Friedman , R .

Despite being pathogenic at the species level , L . monocytogenes in fact comprises a diversity of strains from pathogenic ones that can result in disease and / or mortality to others that are relatively avirulent . The main goal of the current study was to answer the question on whether enhanced binding or attachment of L . monocytogenes to inert surfaces bears any relationship to pathogenicity in food - borne isolates . To answer this question , the nanoscale adhesion forces of eight L . monocytogenes strains that vary in their pathogenicity levels to a model surface of silicon nitride were quantified using atomic force microscopy . The strains used were the highly pathogenic ( EGDe , 874 , 1002 , ATCC 19115 ) , the intermediate pathogenic ( ATCC 19112 , ATCC 19118 ) , and the non pathogenic ( ATCC 15313 and HCC25 ) . Our results indicate that the average nanoscale adhesion ( in nN ) and the 50 % lethal dose ( LD50 ) of strain virulence quantified in mice are logarithmically correlated according to : ( nN ) = - 0 . 032 ln ( LD50 ) + 1 . 040 , r 2 = 0 . 96 . Such correlation indicates that nanoscale adhesion could potentially be used as a design criterion to distinguish between virulent and avirulent L . monocytogenes strains . Finally , stronger adhesion of virulent strains to inert surfaces modeled by silicon nitride might be a way for pathogenic strains to survive better in the environment and thus increase their likelihood of infecting animals or humans . 69 Keywords L . monocytogenes , Adhesion , AFM , Virulence , Bacteria , Interaction forces 70 2 . 1 Introduction Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram positive food - borne human and veterinary pathogen that is widely distributed in the environment 1 . Listeria monocytogenes can cause an array of fatal infections such as listeriosis and meningitis 2 . As a result of the associated high mortality rate among those at risk , the U . S . Department of Agriculture’s and the U . S . Food and Drug Administration established zero tolerance policies for the pathogen in ready to eat foods 3 . Despite being pathogenic at the species level , L . monocytogenes comprises a diversity of strains with some that are virulent and others that are relatively avirulent 4 . In fact , from 13 known serovars of L . monocytogenes , only three ( ½ a , ½ b , and 4b ) account for more than 90 % of human and animal infections 5 . Among these pathogenic serovars , antigenic groups ½ a and ½ b dominate reports of L . monocytogenes in food while serovar 4b strains dominate isolates causing human listeriosis 5 . Excluding host - risk factors , the heterogeneity in the pathogenicity of L . monocytogenes strains among the above three lineages is well documented 5 . Because of the heterogeneity among virulent strains of L . monocytogenes , researchers have developed various criteria to discriminate between virulent and avirulent strains 6 , 7 . Early methods for assessing L . monocytogenes virulence included in vivo bioassays 4 , 8 , 9 and in vitro cell assays 10 , 11 . While in vivo bioassays provide a measurement of all virulence determinants of L . monocytogenes , their dependence on receptors and costs associated with experimental animals 71 testing could be prohibitive . In vitro cell assays offer a low cost alternative but are often slow , and at times variable 4 . Finally , assays dependent on specific proteins 12 and genes 4 as targets for virulence determination on L . monocytogenes have not been suitable because they target virulent vectors that are consistently found in both virulent and avirulent strains . To add to the complexity of predicting L . monocytogenes virulence , virulence differences between isolates could not be matched with differences in their origins 13 , 14 . In addition , published literature indicates that although L . monocytogenes can show strain diversity with respect to resistance to antimicrobial factors , virulence , and attachment to surfaces , no group differences are usually observed between the two key serovars , 4b and ½ 14 . For example , it is not understood why particular strains of L . monocytogenes have an advantage over other strains of adhering better to foods and therefore become naturally selected as clinical isolates 15 . Therefore , applying higher resolution tools such as atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to correlate the virulence of L . monocytogenes with their adhesion to surfaces could lead to establishing design criteria that can be used to predict L . monocytogenes virulence . To establish human and animal virulence , L . monocytogenes and similar to many bacterial strains rely on interacting with their potential hosts in a specific manner utilizing ligand - receptor interactions mechanism 16 . The in vivo mechanism of host infection by L . monocytogenes has received much attention from researchers and an impressive amount of data 72 has contributed to considering this bacterium as one of the best understood intracellular pathogens 17 . Although the intracellular path of L . monocytogenes to infection is among the best understood for an organism 17 , the extracellular path involving bacterial attachment to inert surfaces followed by bacterial survival and growth is poorly understood 18 . Shedding the light on how L . monocytogenes interact non - specifically with inert surfaces is a key factor to understanding how they contaminate foods and surfaces , the process that can be considered as the first crucial ex vivo step in their successful route to establishing infections 19 . The main goal of the present study is to improve our understanding of the relationship between the nanoscale adhesion of L . monocytogenes to a model inert surface of silicon nitride and the microbe’s pathogenicity . To investigate this relationship , we measured the nanoscale adhesion of eight L . monocytogenes strains that vary in their virulence level to a model inert surface of silicon nitride using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . Nanoscale adhesion forces were correlated with in vivo virulence measurements of the same strains tested in mice . The use of AFM to investigate microbial interactions with surfaces has been well documented in the literature for both Gram - negative and Gram - positive bacteria 20 - 28 . Owing to its high lateral and vertical resolutions and its ability to image and quantify microbial interactions in a liquid environment that mimics real world environment 29 , AFM studies provide unique tools that can lead to a significantly better fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that control 73 bacterial adhesion , virulence , and survival in the environment . 2 . 2 Materials and Methods 2 . 2 . 1 Bacterial Cultures . Eight Listeria monocytogenes strains that vary in their virulence were used in our experiments ( Table 2 . 1 ) . All strains used were obtained from Dr . Mark Lawrence at the Department of Basic Sciences at Mississippi State University , MS . All strains were activated by growing for twelve hours at 30 ˚ C on a shaker rotating at 150 rpm in brain heart infusion broth ( BHIB ) adjusted to a pH value of 6 . 0 using 2N HCl 30 . Following the 12 hours , 1 % of activated culture was transferred into 20 ml of BHIB and grown at the conditions above until the late exponential phase of growth . Cells were harvested when the absorbance for each strain at 600 nm reached a constant value that correlated well with the number of single colonies enumerated on brain heart infusion agar plates incubated at 30 o C for 24 hours .

Prior to AFM measurements , bacterial cells grown until late exponential phase of growth and centrifuged twice at 5525g for 10 minutes were attached to gelatin - coated mica disks according to the procedure detailed elsewhere 31 . Briefly , a mica disk ( Ted Pella , Inc . Redding , CA ) was cleaved five times on both sides to obtain fresh surfaces . The mica disk with fresh surfaces was then gelatin - coated by dipping into a gelatin solution prepared by dissolving 0 . 5 g of gelatin ( Sigma G6144 ) in 100 ml ultra - pure deionized water ( DI ) at 60 o C and then cooled to 40 o C . The gelatin - coated mica disk was allowed to air - dry overnight by standing on its edge on a paper towel . After drying , a 20 µ l aliquot of bacterial suspension was pipetted onto the gelatin - coated disk and allowed to stay there for 10 minutes for the bacteria to physically adsorb on the gelatin at room temperature . The disks were then rinsed gently with DI water and used directly for the AFM measurements . 2 . 2 . 3 Atomic Force Microscopy Force Measurements . All AFM force measurements were performed with a PicoForce™ Scanning Probe Microscope with Nanoscope IIIa controller and extender module ( Veeco Inc . , Santa Barbara , CA ) under water . We have chosen to perform our measurements under water since we are interested in quantifying how L . monocytogenes strains attach to inert surfaces . Water is the main solvent used in the food processing industries and the main solvent used in preparing foods 32 . Silicon nitride cantilevers ( DNP - S , Veeco Inc . , Santa Barbara , CA ) were used in all experiments as our model surface because they are characterized 75 by a surface charge similar to each of soil and glass 33 . Both soil and glass are substrates to which L . monocytogenes frequently attaches to in nature 34 and during food processing 35 . The force constant of each cantilever was determined prior to force measurements from the power spectral density of the thermal noise fluctuations in DI water 36 . On average , the spring constant was found to be 0 . 061 ± 0 . 008 N / m ( n = 9 ) . Prior to force measurements , L . monocytogenes images captured using TappingMode™ under DI water at a scan speed of 1 Hz at a resolution of 256 pixels per line and 256 lines per image were used to locate the cells , ensure the cells population homogeneity and appropriate morphology . Once a bacterial cell had been located via topographical scanning , the oscillation of the cantilever was stopped , and the extending and retracting deflection - displacement curves measured between the bacterial surface biopolymers and the silicon nitride cantilever were captured under water using the AFM software . Force measurements were made on a bacteria - free area of the gelatin - coated mica disk before and after making the measurement on a bacterial cell . Equality of the measurements ensured that the tip properties had not been altered by contact with the bacterial surface biopolymers . For each strain type , at least nine cells from three different cultures were examined . For each bacterial cell , the point and shoot feature of the AFM software was used to locate fifteen spots to cover most of the bacterial cell surface to perform force measurements ( Figure 2 . 1A ) . Retraction curves were measured at a rate of 580 nm / sec to 76 minimize the hydrodynamic drag forces 37 and a resolution of 4096 points . When analyzed , the retraction curves were considered individually because of the complex and heterogeneous nature of interactions observed between the bacterial surface biopolymers and the AFM silicon nitride cantilever . 2 . 2 . 4 Analysis of Retraction Curves . Retraction curves are generally used to quantify bacterial adhesion strength , elasticity of bacterial biopolymers , interaction specificity , and homogeneity of the bacterial surface biopolymers 38 . Here we focus on using retraction curves to quantify bacterial adhesion to a model surface . Figure 2 . 1B shows an example on a retractions curve that consists of multiple peaks with arrows indicating adhesion events . Each peak in the retraction curve has two coordinates ( pull - off distance , pull - off force ) . The pull - off distance indicates the location at which the cantilever contacted the bacterial surface biopolymer chain . The pull - off force is equivalent to the adhesion force and represents the sum of all interaction forces between the bacterial surface biopolymers and the AFM cantilever . The baseline for each peak was taken at zero force and only peaks that had magnitudes larger than 0 . 025 nN were counted . The 0 . 025 nN value was chosen as the force limit since it represents the minimal force that could be clearly identified with the resolution of our microscope . 77 A ) Distance ( µ m ) 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 P u ll - O ff F o r c e ( n N ) - 0 . 4 0 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 F D B ) 78 Figure 2 . 1 .

C ) Examples on retraction curves measured on the eight individual L . monoc ytogenes strains with variable number of peaks in each curve . 2 . 2 . 5 Modeling of Retraction curves : Statistical Distributions of Adhesion Affinities . The adhesion affinities between the AFM silicon nitride cantilever and the bacterial surface biopolymers ( | pull - off forces | ) were distributed over a wide range due to the heterogeneous 79 nature of the bacterial surface macromolecules . Log - normal probability distribution function with four fitting parameters was applied to the adhesion affinity data . The log - normal asymmetric probability peak distribution is described as the single - tailed probability distribution of any random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed 39 . The log - normal distribution of the adhesion forces ( F ) is described by ⎟⎟⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜⎝ ⎛ − + = 2 2 2 ) / ( ln exp ) , , , ( d c F b a d c b a f ( 2 . 1 ) Where a is the intercept of the log - normal distribution , b is the amplitude of the distribution and predicts the maximum probability of occurrences , c is the adhesion force with the maximum probability , and d is a fitting parameter that indicates the width of the distribution function . Sigma Plot version 10 . 0 ( Systat software , Inc . , 2006 ) was used to automatically estimate the fitting parameters and the quality of the fit for all data sets . 2 . 2 . 6 Statistical Description of AFM Data . Statistical tests were used to determine if the adhesion strength is different among different virulent strains investigated . The non - parametric group comparisons Dunn’s ranks test available in Sigma Stat 2 . 03 ( Jandel Scientific ) was applied to the data . 80 2 . 3 Results and Discussion 2 . 3 . 1 Distribution of Adhesion Affinities . With bacterial surfaces that are known to comprise many types of biopolymers , it is not surprising that a range of adhesion affinities and magnitudes for the silicon nitride tip was observed for the eight strains of L . monocytogenes tested ( Table 2 . 2 , Figure 2 . 2 ) . With no exception , AFM studies of nanoscale bacterial adhesion to surfaces always demonstrate large heterogeneity as evident from large standard deviations in the mean of the adhesion force 40 , 41 . Since the heterogeneity in bacterial adhesion measurements is a fact that researchers in this community have to deal with , implementing statistical tools to potentially minimize the heterogeneity effects on the measurements can be useful . Several statistical models were tested for their ability to describe such distributions and thus minimize the heterogeneity effect on the adhesion measurements . When compared with normal , gamma , bimodal , Gaussian , logistic and Lorentzian peak distribution functions , the log - normal peak distribution function with four fitting parameters was the best to fit the distributions of adhesion forces measured on all strains investigated ( data not shown ) . The quality of the log - normal peak distribution function to fit our data was judged by the coefficient of correlation ( r 2 ) values which were always higher than 0 . 94 for all eight strains tested . Based on the log - normal fitting results , the distribution of adhesion affinities tends to become wider as the virulence of the strains increases . This is apparent from the increase in the 81 area under the tail of the asymmetric log - normal distribution fits as the virulence of the strain increases ( Figure 2 . 2 ) . In addition , as virulence of L . monocytogenes strains increased , it was observed that the probability of measuring higher adhesion forces increased as well .

Histograms showing the distribution of adhesion affinities measured between eight L . monocytogenes surface biopolymers and silicon nitride in water . Solid lines indicate 83 the log - normal peak function fits to the adhesion forces distribution data . The probabilities of adhesion events were normalized by the total number of adhesion events measured for each particular strain ( Table 2 . 2 ) . Insets show the probability histograms for the number of peaks observed per individual retraction curve for all retraction curves analyzed . For example , Figure 2 . 1B indicates 5 peaks per curve . Previously , we showed that other peak dynamic statistical models including gamma and normal distributions were better suited to fit the distribution affinities of the Escherichia coli JM109 lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) for the AFM silicon nitride tip when compared to the log - normal peak function 33 . Differences in the surface chemistry of the surfaces of the Gram - negative E . coli JM109 and the Gram - positive L . monocytogenes could be responsible for these observations 33 . 2 . 3 . 2 Nanoscale Adhesion Forces Measured between L . monocytogenes Strains and Silicon Nitride . Nanoscale adhesion measured between the AFM cantilever and bacterial surface is mostly the result of the adhesion of the bacterial surface biopolymers to the cantilever 21 , 33 , 42 . In general , bacterial surface is crowded with surface molecules 21 , 43 . The high grafting density of molecules on the bacterial surface allows generally multi - molecules to interact with the AFM cantilever at one point . When the cantilever is pulled away from the bacterial surface , these molecules start to fall off the AFM cantilever resulting in more than one adhesion peak in the retraction data ( example : five peaks in Figure 2 . 1B ) . As can be seen from insets in Figure 2 . 2 , 5 - 10 multiple peaks were usually recorded in the retraction data for all eight strains tested . In few 84 cases , a single peak was observed . Figure 2 . 1C shows examples on retraction curves with multiple peaks measured on each of the eight L . monocytogenes strains investigated in the current study . Pair - wise statistical tests were used to determine if adhesion forces measured between the biopolymers of the eight L . monocytogenes strains and silicon nitride were significantly different from one another . All 28 combinations of pairs among the eight different L . monocytogenes strains were tested . The differences in the median values among the adhesion forces for each L . monocytogenes strain tested were significantly greater than would be expected by chance except for four cases . The adhesion forces measured in water on ATCC 19112 were not significantly different from those measured on ( ATCC 19115 , 1002 , and 874 ) and the adhesion forces measured in water on ATCC 19115 were not different from those measured on 874 ( Dunn rank sum tests , Bonferroni adjustment , α = 0 . 05 / 28 = 0 . 0018 , p > 0 . 05 ) . Since measured nanoscale adhesion forces between silicon nitride cantilever and biopolymers of the eight L . monocytogenes strains spanned a range of forces as can be seen from Figure 2 . 2 , the arithmetic mean , mode , median and range were quantified and compared for the adhesion force data ( Table 2 . 2 ) . The results in Table 2 . 2 indicate that the although median values of the adhesion forces measured on the eight L . monocytogenes strains tested were slightly lower than the arithmetic mean values , they followed the same trend . It is also clear from Table 2 . 2 that 85 as the virulence of the strains increases , the range of adhesion forces also increases , indicating that the probability of measuring higher forces on such strains also increases with virulence . Variations observed in the adhesion forces measured between the surface biopolymers of L . monocytogenes strains that vary in their virulence and silicon nitride could be attributed to variations in surface compositions and surface properties among the strains tested 15 , 44 . Although beyond the scope of this paper , recent genetic studies have indicated significant differences in the composition of surface proteins of virulent and avirulent species of L . monocytogenes 45 . Genetic differences in the composition of Listeria virulent and avirulent species support our idea that the abundance of L . monocytogenes surface proteins probably have a role in the ability of this bacterium to survive in diverse environments and to interact with a large variety of inert surfaces in addition to their well established role in establishing virulence 46 . When compared to literature studies , observing sub - nN adhesion forces on average similar to those measured on L . monocytogenes strains is not uncommon . Examples from the literature include sub - nN forces measured by AFM using silicon nitride cantilevers on Pseudomonas putida KT2442 in water 21 , Klebsiella terrigena in 0 . 25 mM potassium phosphate solution adjusted to pH 6 . 8 47 , and Burkholderia cepacia G4 in 1 mM phosphate buffered silane 48 . Irrespective of the fact that the forces measured in this study were in the sub - nN , statistical significant differences were recorded between most pairs investigated . This is not the case , 86 however , for all AFM adhesion measurements reported in the literature on bacteria including ones with much larger adhesion forces . For example , insignificant differences were recorded between streptococcus mutants LT11 and IB03987 and an AFM silicon nitride cantilever coated with a laminin film at pH 5 . 8 according to the sign test of median values 49 . Magnitudes of adhesion forces are largely dependent on the bacterial type investigated and its surface composition , bacterial physiochemical properties , the substrate properties to which adhesion forces are measured , and the environmental solution in which interactions are being measured . Therefore , extreme caution should be taken when adhesion forces measured using AFM between different bacterial strains to substrates with variable properties in different solutions are to be compared . 2 . 3 . 3 Correlation between L . monocytogenes Virulence and Nanoscale Adhesion . To investigate the relationship between L . monocytogenes virulence represented by the lethal dose required to kill 50 % of mice in an animal model study ( LD50 ) and nanoscale adhesion , the average and median values of all measured nanoscale adhesion forces between silicon nitride and the L . monocytogenes strain of interest were quantified ( Table 2 . 2 ) . Average adhesion forces is considered by many in the literature as a good representative of adhesion force affinities since it represents a comprehensive quantitative measure with error bars of the range of forces measured between bacterial surface biopolymers and silicon nitride 47 , 48 , 50 , 51 . In addition , we have also 87 used the median values as another correlation measure between nanoscale adhesion forces and virulence . Figure 2 . 3 shows that the estimated virulence of eight L . monocytogenes ( Table 2 . 2 ) and their average and median nanoscale adhesion forces to an inert surface of silicon nitride were correlated . As the virulence of L . monocytogenes increased ( lower LD50 values ) 4 , the nanoscale average adhesion forces measured between silicon nitride and L . monocytogenes surface biopolymers increased logarithmically where mean adhesion force ( nN ) = - 0 . 032 ln ( LD50 ) + 1 . 04 , r 2 = 0 . 96 . When compared among 97 equations provided by TableCurve v1 . 11 ( Jandel Scientific ) , the logarithmic equation was the best to explain the relationship between adhesion forces and virulence of L . monocytogenes investigated ( data not shown ) . Similarly , when the adhesion forces median values were used , a similar logarithmic correlation was obtained where median adhesion force ( nN ) = - 0 . 026 ln ( LD50 ) + 0 . 871 , r 2 = 0 . 88 . Our data is suggestive of the presence of a logarithmic correlation between the virulence and nanoscale adhesion of L . monocytogenes to silicon nitride irrespective of whether mean or median values were used as the statistical measures of nanoscale adhesion forces . Such relationship could be previewed as preliminary direct evidence on the possibility of using nanoscale adhesion measurements as a way to distinguish virulent and avirulent strains of L . monocytogenes . 88 LD50 ( # ) 1e + 6 1e + 7 1e + 8 1e + 9 1e + 10 1e + 11 1e + 12 A dhe s i on F o r c e ( n N ) 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 Mean Median Figure 2 . 3 . The relationships between L . monocytogenes virulence represented by the 50 % lethal dose ( LD50 ) and both the average and the median of the nanoscale adhesion forces measured between individual eight L . monocytogenes surface biopolymers and silicon nitride in water . The error bars on the mean values represent the standard error of mean . The solid line is the regression fit of the mean data and is described by : mean adhesion force ( nN ) = - 0 . 032 ln ( LD50 ) + 1 . 04 , r 2 = 0 . 96 . The dashed line is the regression fit of the median data and is described by : median adhesion force ( nN ) = - 0 . 026 ln ( LD50 ) + 0 . 871 , r 2 = 0 . 88 . In comparison , reports in the literature correlating virulence of L . monocytogenes with their macroscale adhesion have been conflicting . For example , results obtained on the ability of 36 isolates of L . monocytogenes to form biofilms on a food - grade stainless steel surface showed that there were no correlations between the degree of initial attachment to stainless steel and strain serotype or source but that attachment was enhanced when the cells produced extracellular 89 fibrils 52 . The conclusions from the study raised an important question that we attempted to answer here on whether enhanced binding of L . monocytogenes to inert surfaces bears any relationship to pathogenicity 52 . On the contrary , other reports in the literature were able to qualitatively correlate macroscale attachment and virulence of L . monocytogenes . For example , the macroscale attachment of a 101 strains of L . monocytogenes isolated from food samples and from patients with listeriosis to polystyrene and stainless steel surfaces showed that clinical strains were less adherent to inert surfaces compared to food strains 19 . The results of this report qualitatively show that the macroscale attachment of strains to inert surfaces decreased as virulence increases . Such results contradict our results of increased nanoscale attachment as virulence increased . The opposite trends observed in correlating the virulence of L . monocytogenes with both macroscale and nanoscale attachment studies point to potential important differences in the mechanisms governing bacterial adhesion at macroscales and nanoscales . Finally , eighty L . monocytogenes isolates were screened for their abilities to form biofilms in an attempt to determine the link between biofilm formation and disease incidence for L . monocytogenes 53 . The results of this study showed statistically significant differences in biofilm formation among strains with variable phylogenetic divisions but not among strains of variable serotypes . Increased biofilm formation was observed in Division II strains ( serotypes 90 1 / 2a and 1 / 2c ) , which are not normally associated with food - borne outbreaks . In addition , biofilm formation was also correlated well with the ability of cells to produce expopolysaccharides 53 . Collectively , the examples above indicate the inability of research studies performed at the macroscale to provide consistent relationships between the macroscale attachment to inert surfaces and virulence of L . monocytogenes represented by the pathogen ability to cause disease , strain type , source , or serotype . Such inconsistency raises the need to apply higher resolution tools to finding such correlations . The logarithmic correlation obtained in this study between nanoscale adhesion of L . monocytogenes to inert surfaces and strain virulence is a first step towards such research improvements . 2 . 4 Conclusions The nanoscale adhesion strengths of eight L . monocytogenes strains that vary in their virulence to a model surface of silicon nitride were quantified using AFM . To explain and predict the heterogeneities observed in the nanoscale adhesion measurements , log - normal dynamic probability distribution model was used to fit the adhesion distribution of adhesion affinities . We showed that AFM was capable of distinguishing nanoscale adhesion strengths between eight L . monocytogenes strains that varied in their virulence and silicon nitride . In addition , our results suggest the presence of a logarithmic correlation between L . monocytogenes virulence 91 represented by the 50 % lethal dose of mice and their nanoscale adhesion to silicon nitride . Such relationship between nanoscale adhesion of L . monocytogenes to an inert surface of silicon nitride and virulence can be used as a design criterion to develop better tools that can be used in distinguishing virulent and avirulent L . monocytogenes cells . The stronger adhesion observed for the higher virulence strains might be a way for virulent strains to survive better in the environment and thus increase their likelihood of being virulent to animals and humans . Finally , molecular approach taken in investigating the relationship between L . monocytogenes adhesion and virulence is a new research methodology that was proven to have a high resolution in quantifying nanoscale attachment differences among various strains tested and thus can lead to a better fundamental understanding of the bacterial adhesion and virulence relationships . 2 . 5 Acknowledgements We would like to thank Prof .

First , adhesion energies were quantified spatially on surfaces of individual bacterial cells ( the cell level ) . Second , adhesion energies were quantified between silicon nitride and bacterial cells that belong to an individual Listeria strain but taken from three different cultures ( the strain level ) . Third , adhesion energies were quantified between silicon nitride and bacterial cells that belong to an individual Listeria species type but vary in the strain type ( the species level ) . Finally , adhesion energies were quantified between silicon nitride and bacterial cells that belong to the Listeria genus but vary in the species type ( the genus level ) . The heterogeneities in the adhesion energies were quantified using two indices . The first heterogeneity index ( HI 1 ) was defined as the ratio of the standard error of mean for a given data set to the maximum standard error of mean quantified for all sets of data that belong to a certain cellular level . The second heterogeneity index ( HI 2 ) was defined as the ratio of the standard deviation for a given data set to the maximum standard deviation quantified for all sets of data that belong to a certain cellular level . The heterogeneity indices were shown to increase as the adhesion energy of a particular cell increased . At the species level , the adhesion energies quantified between cells that belonged to the L . monocytogenes species but varied in the strain 104 type from avirulent to virulent strains and silicon nitride correlated linearly with both heterogeneity indices used . The adhesion energies correlated as well with the lethal dose required to kill 50 % of mice in a study ( LD50 ) ; an indicator of strain in vivo virulence . The heterogeneity indices correlated well with LD50 of the strains investigated . Our results thus indicate that as the virulence of L . monocytogenes strains increases , their adhesion energies and heterogeneities increase . Finally , at the species level , our results clearly indicate that pathogenic Listeria species are more heterogeneous compared to the non - pathogenic species of Listeria . Our results also indicate that such heterogeneities increased when increase in the adhesion energies quantified between cells and silicon nitride . To our knowledge , this is the first study that attempted to quantify heterogeneities in adhesion energies quantified between bacterial cells and inert model surfaces in water at four different cellular levels . The methodology introduced here will be applicable to nanoscale heterogeneity investigations of other types of bacteria , viruses and mammalian cells . Keywords Adhesion energy , AFM , Femto - Joule , Listeria , Heterogeneity , Species and Bacteria . 105 3 . 1 Introduction Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) has been widely employed in the investigations of microbial surfaces’ properties and interactions 1 - 4 . In general , interactions upon approach and retraction of a bare AFM cantilever 5 , 6 or a chemically 7 , 8 or biologically 9 - 12 functionalized AFM cantilever to another bacterial or inert surface gets recorded . The data are then analyzed for the adhesion strengths between the two surfaces of interest , of which one of them at least as a bacterial cell 5 - 12 . The strength of bacterial interactions can be reported in terms of bacterial adhesion forces in nano - Newton ( nN ) 1 - 3 , 5 - 8 , 11 , 12 or bacterial adhesion energies in femto - Joules ( fJ ) 9 , 10 , 13 . Although both ways have been reported in the literature 1 - 3 , 5 - 13 , the use of adhesion forces to represent bacterial adhesion is much more common in the literature . While quantifying bacterial adhesion forces at the nanoscale is especially important when ligand - receptor interactions governing the specific interactions of microbes to host mammalian cells or tissues are of interest , we have chosen to report the strength of bacterial adhesion to a model surface of silicon nitride in water using the adhesion energy . Although rarely reported in the literature 9 , 10 , 13 , the use of adhesion energy as a measure of bacterial interactions offers a unique and comprehensive alternative way to the use of nanoscale adhesion forces for the following two reasons . First , to compute the adhesion energy , the area under the retraction curve has to be calculated . As a result of such uniform criterion , the adhesion energy analysis can be easily 106 automated and bacterial interaction results can be compared among different research groups and across various microbes . Second , the adhesion energy represents a comprehensive way to quantify all the interactions measured between the bacterial surface biopolymers and the surface of interest . However , irrespective of whether adhesion forces or adhesion energies were used to report on the bacterial adhesion to surfaces quantified using AFM , the data usually suffers from large variations that make data interpretation generally challenging 14 . Heterogeneities in AFM measurements of bacterial adhesion can be of chemical , physical , biological or practical origins 2 , 3 , 14 , 15 . For example , cells might vary from each other significantly depending on their growth conditions 9 , 16 - 18 and AFM tip may contact different molecules on the bacterial surface in a stochastic manner 15 , 19 - 22 . To describe heterogeneities in AFM measurements of bacterial adhesion , several statistical tools and methods have been used in the literature . Examples include reporting the adhesion data using more than one statistical measure such as the mean , mode , median , and standard deviation of the population of adhesion affinities 23 , 24 and fitting the distributions of the adhesion affinities to different dynamic peak functions 6 , 24 , 25 . In addition , researchers started to investigate the whole bacterial surface by performing bacterial measurements on a grid of the bacterial surface 7 , 8 , 19 , 26 . What is generally still lacking are studies in which a larger number of cells that belong to different cultures and a larger number of 107 bacterial strains and species are being investigated to generalize the AFM findings of interest . The main limiting reason though behind the lack of such studies is the long experimental time needed for the measurements and further for the analysis . Motivated by the lack of studies in the literature in which heterogeneities in AFM bacterial adhesion measurements are investigated for a large number of cells , strains and species , we performed the following study . The adhesion energies were quantified using AFM between a model inert surface of silicon nitride and a wide array of Listeria cells that belonged to different Listeria species . We have systematically investigated magnitudes and heterogeneities in the adhesion energies at four different levels ( cellular , strain , species and genus levels ) . The heterogeneities were quantified using a new approach that depends on normalizing the error in the measurements with respect to each other . To perform our measurements across bacterial cells that represent a whole genus , the genus Listeria was chosen due to the limited number of species that belong to the genus 27 , 28 . The heterogeneities were then correlated with the virulence and adherence capacities of the different strains investigated . The Listeria genus is again unique in that perspective because it contains both virulent and avirulent species as will be discussed below . To our knowledge , this is the first study that quantifies the adhesion energies and their heterogeneities for bacterial cells that represent all species of a whole bacterial genus . The present taxonomic position the genus Listeria is compromised of the following six 108 species : L . monocytogenes , L . innocua , L . seeligeri , L . welshimeri , L . ivanovii and L . grayi 28 . The genus Listeria is closely related to Lactobacillus and Bacillus and more distantly related to Streptococcus and Staphylococcus 28 . Among all the Listeria species , the L . monocytogenes is the only one that is capable of causing human infections while L . ivanovii is capable of causing animal infections 29 . The other Listeria species are non - pathogenic species 29 . Due to the health risks associated with L . monocytogenes infections 30 , the virulence mechanisms of this Listeria species are well studied 31 . L . monocytogenes has thirteen recognized serotypes 32 . However , only L . monocytogenes isolates that have been classified as ½ a , ½ b or 4b were found to cause infections and thus are important in public health studies 33 . 3 . 2 Materials and Methods 3 . 2 . 1 Bacterial Cultures . Table 3 . 1 lists all the Listeria bacterial strains investigated in this study . Listeria cells of strain of interest were activated by growing in brain heart infusion broth ( BHIB ) adjusted to a pH value of 6 . 0 using 2N HCl for twelve hours at 30 ˚ C on a shaker rotating at 150 rpm 16 . Following the 12 hours , 1 % of activated culture was transferred into 20 ml of BHIB and grown at the conditions above until the late exponential phase of growth . 3 . 2 . 2 Immobilization of L . monocytogenes for AFM Measurements . Prior to AFM measurements , Listeria cells grown until late exponential phase of growth and centrifuged twice at 5525g for 10 minutes were attached to gelatin - coated mica disks according to the procedure 109 detailed elsewhere 34 . Briefly , a mica disk ( Ted Pella , Inc . Redding , CA ) was cleaved five times on both sides to obtain fresh surfaces . The mica disk with fresh surfaces was then gelatin - coated by dipping into a gelatin solution prepared by dissolving 0 . 5 g of gelatin ( Sigma G6144 ) in 100 ml ultra - pure deionized water ( DI ) at 60 o C and then cooled to 40 o C . The gelatin - coated mica disk was allowed to air - dry overnight by standing on its edge on a paper towel . After drying , a 20 µ l aliquot of bacterial suspension was pipetted onto the gelatin - coated disk and allowed to stay there for 10 minutes for the bacteria to physically adsorb on the gelatin at room temperature . The disks were then rinsed gently with DI water and used directly for the AFM measurements . 3 . 2 . 3 AFM Force Measurements . All AFM force measurements were performed with a PicoForce™ Scanning Probe Microscope with Nanoscope IIIa controller and extender module ( Veeco Inc . , Santa Barbara , CA ) under water . Silicon nitride cantilevers ( DNP - S , Veeco Inc . , Santa Barbara , CA ) were used in all experiments as our model surface . Silicon nitride cantilevers ( DNP - S , Veeco Inc . , Santa Barbara , CA ) were chosen as our model surface because they are characterized by a surface charge similar to each of soil and glass 6 . Both soil and glass are substrates to which pathogenic and non - pathogenic Listeria strains frequently attaches to in nature 35 , 36 and during food processing 37 - 44 . The force constant of each cantilever was determined prior to force measurements from the power spectral density of the thermal noise fluctuations in DI water 45 , 46 . We have chosen to perform our measurements under water since 110 we are interested in quantifying how Listeria adhere to inert surfaces used in food industries where water is considered as the main solvent 47 , 48 . Contamination of food is considered as the first step towards L . monocytogenes and L . ivanovii infections 49 - 51 . Prior to force measurements , bacterial cell images captured using TappingMode™ under DI water at a scan speed of 1 Hz at a resolution of 256 pixels per line and 256 lines per image were used to locate the cells , ensure the cells population homogeneity and appropriate morphology . Once a bacterial cell had been located via topographical scanning , the oscillation of the cantilever was stopped , and the extending and retracting deflection - displacement curves measured between the bacterial surface biopolymers and the silicon nitride cantilever were captured under water using the AFM software . Force measurements were made on a bacteria - free area of the gelatin - coated mica disk before and after making the measurement on a bacterial cell . Consistency of the measurements ensured that the tip properties had not been altered by contact with the bacterial surface biopolymers . In our experiments , at least ten cells from two to three different cultures were examined . On each cell investigated , the point and shoot feature of the AFM software was used to select fifteen locations on the bacterial surface to perform force measurements except for measurements which were performed for investigations at the cell level 24 . For the cell level particular case , adhesion energies were measured between bacterial surface biopolymers and the silicon nitride cantilever using grids that varied from one location at the 111 center of the bacterial cell to as many as 32 locations that spanned the whole bacterial cell surface . Retraction curves were measured at a rate of 580 nm / sec to minimize the hydrodynamic drag forces 24 and a resolution of 4096 points . 3 . 2 . 4 Analysis of Retraction Curves . Retraction curves were individually analyzed to quantify the femtoscale adhesion energy ( fJ = 1×10 - 15 J ) between bacterial cell surface biopolymers and silicon nitride in water . The adhesion energy was computed for each individual curve as the area under the force - distance curve with the baseline taken at zero force . In general , force and energy are correlated such as 13 : ∫ − = 2 1 h h Fdh E ( 3 . 1 ) Where E is the adhesion energy , F is the pull - off force , and h is the separation distance . The negative sign was used to convert pull - off forces into adhesion forces . To calculate the adhesion energy , the integral in equation 3 . 1 was evaluated using the Trapezoidal rule ( equation 3 . 2 ) 13 . ) ] ( 2 ) ( ) ( [ 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 n h h k h F h F h F n h h Fdh n k h h − + + + − ≈ ∑ ∫ − = ( 3 . 2 ) In equation 3 . 2 , n was equal to 4096 , the number of data points collected per retraction force curve and the bounds of integration ( h 1 and h 2 ) were taken as the first and last distance points at which the retraction curve crosses the zero force axes ( gray arrows in Figure 3 . 1 ) and varied 112 from one curve to another . In computing the integral in equation 3 . 1 , a uniform grid was always used 13 . Figrue 3 . 1 . Example on a retraction curve measured between AFM silicon nitride cantilever and L . monocytogenes EGDe in water . The gray shadowed area represents the work of adhesion or adhesion energy . The grey arrows at the top of curve indicate the bounds of integration where the adhesion energy was computed using equations 3 . 1 and 3 . 2 . 3 . 2 . 5 Quantifying the Heterogeneity in Adhesion Energy Measurements . The heterogeneities in the adhesion energies were quantified using two indices . The first heterogeneity index ( HI 1 ) was defined as the ratio of the standard error of mean for a given data set to the maximum 113 standard error of mean quantified for all sets of data that belong to a certain cellular level . The second heterogeneity index ( HI 2 ) was defined as the ratio of the standard deviation for a given data set to the maximum standard deviation quantified for all sets of data that belong to a certain cellular level . At the strain level , at least 10 cells from two to three different cultures were investigated . For each cell , 15 curves that span the whole cell surface were used to quantify the adhesion energy of the cell to silicon nitride in water . A standard deviation of the 15 measurements taken on each cell and the standard error of mean were calculated . The cells then get ranked from the one with the lowest standard deviation ( the least heterogeneous cell ) to the one with the highest standard deviation ( the most heterogeneous cell ) . HI 2 was then defined as the standard deviation obtained for each cell divided by the standard deviation obtained for the most heterogeneous cell . At the strain level , because a fixed number of curves was always used to quantify the adhesion energies , HI 1 and HI 2 were the same . Similarly , at the species level , when different strain types were investigated for the L . monocytogenes species , the standard deviation and the standard error of mean for all adhesion energies quantified on at least 10 cells ( number of curves varied from 150 to 390 curves ) were calculated . The strains were then ranked in ascending order from the strain with the lowest standard deviation to that with the highest standard deviation and from the strain with the lowest standard error of mean to that with the highest standard error of mean . The most heterogeneous strain type was the same for both types 114 of heterogeneity measures . The HI 1 and HI 2 were defined as the ratio of standard error of mean and the standard deviation of a particular strain to that of the strain with the largest standard deviation and standard error of mean , respectively . Finally , at the genus level , when different species types were investigated for the Listeria genus , the standard deviation and the standard error of mean for all adhesion energies quantified on at least 10 cells ( number of curves varied from 150 to 390 curves ) were calculated . The species were then ranked in ascending order from the species with the lowest standard deviation to that with the highest standard deviation and from the species with the lowest standard error of mean to that with the highest standard error of mean . The most heterogeneous species type was the same for both types of heterogeneity measures . The HI 1 and HI 2 were defined as the ratio of the standard error of mean and the standard deviation and of a particular species to that of the species with the largest standard deviation and standard error of mean , respectively . In our results , the HI 1 and HI 2 ratios were multiplied by a 100 to indicate percentages of relative heterogeneities among cells , strains or species compared . 3 . 2 . 6 Statistical Description of AFM Data . The heterogeneity in the adhesion energy measurements was quantified in terms of the standard deviation of a data set . The standard deviation ( σ ) of a distribution of adhesion energy data with N points is given by the square root of the sample variance as shown in equation ( 3 . 3 ) 52 . 115 ∑ = − = N i i E E N 1 2 ) ( 1 σ ( 3 . 3 ) Where E i is adhesion energy of point in the distribution of adhesion energies in fJ and E is the mean of the adhesion energy values for all the population given as : N E E N i i ∑ = ( 3 . 4 ) The standard deviation is a widely used measure of the variability or dispersion from the mean value of the data in a distribution . It is easy to compute algebraically and low standard deviation value indicates the data points in the distribution are close to the mean and a high standard deviation indicates that the data is spread out over a large range of values . The standard error of mean ( σ M ) represents the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean and is given by : N M σ σ = ( 3 . 5 ) Equation ( 3 . 5 ) does not assume a normal distribution and indicates that the larger the sample size , the smaller the standard error of the mean , the more statistically representative the data are 53 . Statistical tests were used to determine if adhesion energies quantified between bacterial surface biopolymers and silicon nitride in water varies across different locations on the cell , among different cells that belonged to a certain strain type , among different strains that belonged to a species types or among different species that belonged to a genus . The non - parametric group 116 comparisons Kruskal - Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks ( ANOVA ) available in Sigma Plot 11 . 0 ( Jandel Scientific ) was applied to the data to compare if the differences among the median values between many ( three or more ) groups were statistically different ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Similarly , the Mann - Whitney Rank Sum Test available in Sigma Plot 11 . 0 ( Jandel Scientific ) was applied to the data to compare if the differences among the median values between two groups were statistically different ( p < 0 . 05 ) . 3 . 3 Results 3 . 3 . 1 Heterogeneities in Adhesion Energies Probed at Cellular level . Adhesion energies were measured between silicon nitride cantilevers and individual Listeria bacterial cells in water . The dependence of the adhesion energies on the location measurement on the bacterial cell was investigated for bacterial cells that represent all Listeria species ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . For each cell investigated , force measurements were performed on the center of the cell ( one measurement ) as well as at various locations that spanned the whole cell surface . Successively , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 and 15 measurements were performed on each cell surface to investigate if more than one force measurement is needed to represent the adhesion energies between a bacterial cell surface and silicon nitride in water . For the L . monocytogenes 19118 cell , 28 and 32 measurements were also performed . Figure 3 . 1 is a series of box plots that show our results on cells that represent seven L . monocytogenes bacterial strains and on cells that represent the other five types of Listeria species . 117 L . monocytogenes 15313 Number of Points Investigated Per Cell Surface 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 A dhe s i on E ne r g y ( f J ) 0 . 00 0 . 04 0 . 08 0 . 12 0 . 16 L . monocytogenes 19118 Number of Points Investigated Per Cell Surface 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 A dhe s i on E ne r g y ( f J ) 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 35 L . monocytogenes 19112 Number of Points Investigated Per Cell Surface 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 A dhe s i on E ne r g y ( f J ) 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 35 L . monocytogenes 19115 Number of Points Investigated Per Cell Surface 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 A dhe s i on E ne r g y ( f J ) 0 . 00 0 . 04 0 . 08 0 . 12 0 . 16 0 . 20 0 . 24 L . monocytogenes 1002 Number of Points Investigated Per Cell Surface 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 A d he s i on E ne r g y ( f J ) 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 35 0 . 40 L . monocytogenes 874 Number of Points Investigated Per Cell Surface 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 A d he s i on E ne r g y ( f J ) 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 35 0 . 40 0 . 45 L . monocytogenes EGDe Number of Points Investiagted Per Cell Surface 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 A dhe s i on E ne r g y ( f J ) 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 35 L . innocua 415 Number of Points Investigated Per Cell Surface 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 A dhe s i on E ne r g y ( f J ) 0 . 00 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 0 . 04 0 . 05 0 . 06 L . grayi 700545 Number of Points Investiagted Per cell Surface 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 A dhe s i on E ne r g y ( f J ) 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 35 L . welshimeri LMB0082 Number of Points Investiagted Per Cell Surface 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 A d he s i on E ne r g y ( f J ) 0 . 00 0 . 03 0 . 06 0 . 09 0 . 12 0 . 15 0 . 18 L . seeligeri RM308 Number of Points Investigated Per Cell Surface 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 A d he s i on E ne r g y ( f J ) 0 . 00 0 . 04 0 . 08 0 . 12 0 . 16 0 . 20 L . ivanovii LMB1380 Number of Points Investiagted Per cell Surface 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 A dhe s i on E ne r g y ( f J ) 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 0 . 10 0 . 12 0 . 14 0 . 16 0 . 18 Figure 3 . 2 . Each Figure shows box plots collected for adhesion energies measured on individual bacterial cells . On each cell investigated , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 and 15 force 1 4 6 12 15 24 28 118 measurements were made successively on various locations on the cell surface as shown in the images at the bottom of Figure 3 . 2 . Figures are shown for 7 strains of L . monocytogenes and one representative strain of each of the other five types of Listeria species . The L . monocytogenes strains are arranged from low virulent strain ( 15313 ) to the highest virulent strain ( EGDe ) . The tapping mode images at the bottom of the Figure show point and shoot AFM maps of the locations of force measurements performed on one L . monocytogenes 19118 cell ; the only cell that was investigated as well using 24 and 28 force measurement points . On each image , the white crosses indicate the force measurements . The arrows plotted indicate the sequence of the measurements . The red circle indicates the point at which the last force measurement was performed . The number at the corner of the image indicates the number of force measurements performed on the cell surface . The dimensions of the image shown are 800 nm in width , 3 µ m in length and 200 nm in height . Each box plot shows data collected on one cell . The boundaries of the box plot are the lower ( Q1 ) and upper ( Q3 ) quartiles of the adhesion energy values reported on one cell from all retraction curves analyzed . The error bar on the box represents the minimum and maximum adhesion energy values reported on one cell from all retraction curves analyzed ; i . e the range of the adhesion energy measurements . The line in the box indicates the median value of the adhesion energy or the second quartile ( Q2 ) . The circular dots surrounding any box are outlier values in the adhesion energy values quantified per cell . Figure 3 . 2 shows that for any strain investigated , a range of adhesion energies is generally obtained . Figure 3 . 2 shows that as the number of points investigated on the cell surface increases , the range of adhesion energy values obtained increases as well . When the data collected on each cell using a variable number of force measurements were compared , our results indicated that the adhesion energy values are 119 statistically similar irrespective of the species or strain type investigated ( Kruskal - Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks , p > 0 . 05 ) . For all cells investigated , the differences in the median values among the treatment groups were not great enough to exclude the possibility that the difference is due to random sampling variability ; there is not a statistically significant difference ( p > 0 . 05 ) . Our results thus indicate that few sample measurements on any bacterial cell will be sufficient to quantify the adhesion energy between a bacterial cell and a model surface such as silicon nitride . Furthermore , our results indicate that heterogeneities in the bacterial surface composition of the cell are not sufficient to lead to heterogeneities in the adhesion energy measurements between a bacterial cell and a surface of interest . Based on our results , all the measurements after were performed using a constant grid of 15 points of force measurements on any bacterial cell investigated . Our choice of 15 force measurements per cell was just to collect enough data for comparison purposes . 3 . 3 . 2 Heterogeneities in Adhesion Energies Probed at Strain level . Bacterial strains that represent all Listeria species were investigated for heterogeneities in the adhesion energies quantified between different bacterial cells that belong to one Listeria strain and silicon nitride in water . Adhesion energies were measured between silicon nitride cantilevers and at least ten cells taken from two or three different cultures of each Listeria strain investigated ( Figure 3 . 3 ) . For each cell investigated , force measurements were performed on 15 locations that spanned the 120 whole cell surface . Therefore , 15 adhesion energy values were collected on each cell .

Each Figure shows a series of box plots that represent adhesion energies quantified between silicon nitride and different cells that belonged to a certain Listeria strain in water . Number of cells investigated per strain varied from 10 cells to 26 cells . 121 Seven bacterial strains of L . monocytogenes were investigated and arranged according to virulence in the Figure from the least virulent ( 15313 ) to the most virulent ( EGDe ) . In addition , five different strains that represent other Listeria species were investigated . In each box plot , columns with same filling represent cells that were cultivated from one culture . Up to three shades of boxes are shown to indicate cells taken from three different cultures . The measurements collected on each cell were represented by a box plot . The adhesion energy values collected on each cell were statistically similar between cells as discussed above ( Kruskal - Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks , p > 0 . 05 ) . Box plots were then constructed for all cells investigated per strain . For example , 10 cells were investigated for the L . monocytogenes 19118 strain . These cells come from three different cultures . Each cell is represented by one box , thus Figure 3 . 3 L . monocytogenes 19118 has ten boxes that represent the ten cells . When compared statistically , the adhesion energy values measured on each cell was statistically different from adhesion energies measured on different cells . The differences in the median values among the treatment groups are greater than would be expected by chance ; there is a statistically significant difference ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) . This was true irrespective of whether cells were cultivated from one culture or from different cultures . This was as well true for all cells investigated irrespective of their strain type . Our results thus indicate that adhesion energy measurements should be performed on more than one bacterial cell taken from different cultures to obtain statistically representative bacterial adhesion measurements at the nanoscale . 122 The number of cells to investigate will vary depends on the purpose of the measurements . In general , the number of cells chosen to investigate should be sufficient to obtain statistically representative quantitative bacterial adhesion measurements . The heterogeneities in the adhesion energies probed at the strain level were quantified for all cells investigated . As described in the methodology section , a heterogeneity index was calculated for each cell . Note that because a constant grid of 15 locations was selected to perform force measurements on any cell surface irrespective of the strain type , the values of HI 1 and HI 2 were similar . Therefore in Figure 3 . 4 , the X - axis was labeled as “Heterogeneity Index” without a subscript number . To calculate the HI value for each cell , the standard deviation and the standard error of mean of all adhesion energies collected on each cell ( 15 values ) were computed . The cells were then ranked in an ascending order from the cell with the lowest standard deviation ( the least heterogeneous ) to the cell with the highest standard deviation ( the most heterogeneous ) . HI was then calculated for each cell as the standard deviation of the cell multiplied by hundred divided by the highest standard deviation reported for all cells that belong to one strain . Each scatter graph in Figure 3 . 4 shows the relationship between the HI values and the average adhesion energy values for all cells that belong to one strain . A constant relationship that can predict all the trends in the scatter graphs shown in Figure 3 . 4 was not found . However , the heterogeneity index was observed to increase in general in all the scatter graphs in Figure 3 . 4 123 with the increase in the adhesion energies reported on the cell . It has to be noted as well that the HI values for all cells investigated span the whole range from 0 - 100 indicating that cells vary in their heterogeneity levels quite a bit ( Figure 3 . 4 ) .

A series of scatter graphs of which each represents the relationship between the heterogeneity index quantified for a number of cells that belonged to one Listeria strain and the average adhesion energy quantified for all adhesion energies measured on each cell investigated . The error bars represent the standard error of mean in the adhesion energies quantified for each cell . 3 . 3 . 3 Heterogeneities in Adhesion Energies Probed at the Species Level . Adhesion energies quantified between L . monocytogenes various strains and silicon nitride in water were investigated for L . monocytogenes strains that vary in their virulence from low virulent strains to highly virulent strains ( Table 3 . 1 ) . Seven different L . monocytogenes strains were investigated . The strains were ranked in virulence according to the value of their bacterial lethal dose required to kill 50 % of mice in a study ( LD50 ) 54 . For each L . monocytogenes strain investigated , at least 10 cells were investigated . On each cell , 15 force measurements were performed . The average of all the adhesion energies collected per strain ( at least 150 values ) was calculated . Figure 3 . 5 shows the relationship between the adhesion energies quantified for all L . monocytogenes strains and their corresponding LD50 values . As can be seen from the Figure , a logarithmic linear relationship is found . When compared among 97 equations provided by TableCurve v1 . 11 ( Jandel Scientific ) , the logarithmic equation was the best model to explain the relationship between adhesion forces and virulence of L . monocytogenes investigated ( data not shown ) . This finding indicates that as the in vivo virulence of the L . monocytogenes strain increases , their in 125 vitro adherence to inert surfaces as indicated by the femto - Joule adhesion energies increases as well . This finding is consistent with our previously reported results which indicated the presence of a similar relationship between the adhesion forces that govern the interactions of L . monocytogenes with silicon nitride in water and the strains LD50 24 . 126 Table 3 . 1 : A summary of all Listeria strains investigated in this study , their adhesion energies to silicon nitride in water ( E ) , the standard deviation of all adhesion energy measurements per strain ( σ )  the standard error of mean of all adhesion energy measurements per strain ( M σ ) , HI1 and HI2 values based on the standard error of mean and the standard deviation values , respectively . Shadowed rows indicate pathogenic Listeria strains while white - filled rows indicate non - pathogenic strains . For the non - pathogenic strains , there are no LD50 values because these strains are incapable of killing mice .

The relationship between L . monocytogenes virulence represented by the 50 % lethal dose ( LD50 ) and the average femto - Joule adhesion energy measured between L . monocytogenes surface biopolymers and silicon nitride in water . The error bars represent the standard error of mean in the adhesion energy measurements on all cells that belonged to a L . monocytogenes strain . The solid line is the regression fit of the data described by : adhesion energy ( fJ ) = - 0 . 0098 ln ( LD50 ) + 0 . 3297 , r 2 = 0 . 89 . The heterogeneities in the adhesion energies probed at the species level were quantified for all strains investigated . As described in the methodology section , two heterogeneity indices were calculated for each strain . The first heterogeneity index ( HI 1 ) is based on standard error of mean values and the second heterogeneity index ( HI 2 ) is based on the standard deviation values . Note that the standard deviation and the standard error of mean values were calculated for all 128 adhesion energy values collected on all the cells that belonged to one L . monocytogenes strain . After that , strains were ranked in an ascending order according to the calculated values of the standard deviation and the standard error of mean for each strain . According to our results , the strain that had the highest standard deviation was the same strain that had the highest standard error of mean ( the most heterogeneous strain , L . monocytogenes EGDe ) . The HI 1 and HI 2 values were then calculated for each L . monocytogenes strain as the standard error of mean or the standard deviation of the strain multiplied by hundred divided by the highest standard error of mean or standard deviation reported for L . monocytogenes EGDe . The defined and computed heterogeneity indices for all L . monocytogenes strains investigated were then correlated with two main active operations of bacterial cells to find out if a relationship did exist . The first operation was bacterial adhesion process and second operation was bacterial virulence . Figures 3 . 6A and 3 . 6B show the relationship between HI 1 and HI 2 and the adhesion energy measured in femto - Joule between bacterial cells and silicon nitride in water . As can be seen from the Figures , a linear relationship was found between the heterogeneity measures and bacterial adhesion energy to inert surface . The slopes of the linear relationships shown were positive indicating that heterogeneity increases as the adhesion energy increases . The HI 1 values defined on the basis of standard error of mean were better correlated with the adhesion energy values in comparison to the HI 2 values obtained on the basis of the standard 129 deviation . Similarly , Figures 3 . 6C and 3 . 6D show the relationship between HI 1 and HI 2 and the bacterial virulence quantified by the LD50 values . As can be seen from the Figures , a logarithmic relationship was found between the heterogeneity measures and bacterial virulence . The slopes of the linear relationships shown were negative indicating that heterogeneity increases as LD50 values decreases or virulence increases . The HI 1 values defined on the basis of standard error of mean were better correlated with the bacterial virulence LD50 values in comparison to the HI 2 values obtained on the basis of the standard deviation . Our results thus indicate that the use of the standard error of mean to quantify and describe heterogeneities in bacterial adhesion measurements is preferred over the standard deviation . This indicates as well that effect of heterogeneities in predicting differences in bacterial adherence or virulence properties among different strains can be minimized by performing more measurements . 130 Figure 3 . 6 .

Adhesion energies quantified between cells that represent all six types of Listeria various species and silicon nitride in water were investigated for both virulent and avirulent species ( Table 3 . 1 ) . For each Listeria strain investigated , adhesion energies between silicon nitride and at least 10 cells in water were quantified . On each cell , 15 force measurements were performed . The average , standard deviation and standard error of mean of all the adhesion energies collected per strain ( at least 150 values ) were calculated . All 12 strains were then ranked in an ascending order from those with lowest to highest in standard error of mean as well as in standard deviation . As described in the methodology section , the values of HI 1 and HI 2 were then computed by normalizing the values of each strain standard deviation and standard error of mean over the maximum standard error of mean and standard deviation values reported for all strains ( that of L . monocytogenes EGDe ) . As can be seen from Table 3 . 1 , the Listeria virulent strains were associated with higher values for both heterogeneity indices compared to the avirulent strains . For the virulent strains , the values of HI 1 and HI 2 were 80 . 1 ± 15 . 5 and 82 . 2 ± 12 . 3 , respectively while for the avirulent strains , the values of HI 1 and HI 2 were 52 . 5 ± 16 . 3 and 65 . 8 ± 20 . 6 , respectively . Our findings here with regard to virulent and avirulent Listeria species are 132 consistent with our findings above which were obtained for the virulent and avirulent strains that belonged to the L . monocytogenes species . The adhesion energies quantified for all Listeria species were investigated to check if the virulent and avirulent species vary in their adhesion energies to inert surfaces . Figure 3 . 7 shows the distribution of adhesion energies collected for all virulent and avirulent strains . As can be seen from the Figure , adhesion energies spanned a range for both virulent and avirulent species . However , the distribution of the adhesion energies for the avirulent species was narrower compared to that of the virulent species . This is to be expected we have already observed that the virulent species are more heterogeneous compared to the avirulent species . To describe the distribution of the adhesion energies observed in Figure 3 . 7 , the log - normal dynamic peak function was fit to the data ( solid lines in Figure 3 . 7 ) . The ability of the log - normal dynamic peak function to fit the data was judged by the values of r 2 which were 0 . 97 and 0 . 99 for the avirulent and virulent species respectively . According to the log - normal function , the most probable adhesion energy values for all virulent and avirulent Listeria species were 0 . 142 and 0 . 071 fJ , respectively . The values of the most probable adhesion energies obtained above were very comparable to the arithmetic mean values of the adhesion energy population data . The mean of all adhesion energies quantified between silicon nitride and virulent and avirulent Listeria species in water were 0 . 132 and 0 . 072 fJ , respectively . When all the adhesion energy values 133 quantified between silicon nitride and virulent and avirulent Listeria species in water were compared , the results were significantly different ( Mann - Whitney Rank Sum Test , p < 0 . 001 ) . The difference in the median values between the adhesion energies of the virulent and avirulent species is greater than would be expected by chance ; there is a statistically significant difference .

Solid lines indicate the log - normal peak function fits to the distribution of adhesion energies . 134 3 . 4 Discussion 3 . 4 . 1 Spatial Heterogeneities on a Single Bacterium Surface . For long time , AFM measurements of bacterial cell properties and interactions were mostly carried at the center of the bacterial cell or on 5 - 10 randomly selected locations on the top of the bacterial cell 1 , 5 , 25 , 55 . When analyzed , approach curves were considered to be more homogenous and thus generally averaged 2 while retractions curves were generally looked at individually due to the complexity of interactions displayed in those curves 24 . When retractions curves are analyzed for adhesion forces or adhesion energies , the standard deviation values reported were generally large 56 . With bacterial cell surfaces known to be compromised of a wide variety of surface molecules 57 , a question on how important it is to map the whole bacterial cell surface to statistically represent the bacterial surface properties or interactions remained to be answered . In an attempt to address this question , researchers in the microbial cells community started to map microbial surface properties and interactions using grids that represent the whole cellular surface . Examples include mapping the surface charge distribution and the adhesion nanoscale forces of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a COOH - terminated AFM cantilever under various pH conditions using a 16 × 16 grid over a 250 nm 2 area 7 , adhesion force maps of the biodegrading bacteria Rhodococcus erythropolis 20S - E1 - c to hydrophobic terminated AFM cantilever 58 , mapping of single heparin - binding haemagglutinin adhesion ( HBHA ) on the surface of living 135 Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterial cells using an AFM tip decorated with heparin molecules using a 1024 force measurements on 50 nm 2 area 59 , mapping the adhesion forces between Streptococcus mutans and laminin films in buffered solutions adjusted to pH values of 5 . 8 or 6 . 8 using a 32 × 32 grid over areas less than a 1 µm 2 23 and mapping of zero - force heights and mechanical properties of Shewanella putrefaciens using a 10×10 force - volume grid recorded using a silicon nitride cantilever in a 100 mM NaNO 3 with neutral pH 60 . Although the studies above are very interesting , a question on how large the size of the grid needs to be to statistically represent the bacterial surface remains to be answered . In this study , we have attempted to answer that question using a systematic approach and by investigating 12 different bacterial strains . We varied the size of the grid on the bacterial cell from one point to 32 points in certain occasions and for each grid , the adhesion energies in femto - Joule between the bacterial cell surface biopolymers and silicon nitride AFM cantilever in water were calculated . Our results indicated that the size of the grid did not influence the overall adhesion energy quantified between the bacterial cell and silicon nitride in water for the 12 strains investigated . Therefore , mapping cell surfaces might be important for studies that involve determination of the location of certain ligands or receptors 59 and in studies seeking fundamental understanding of the role of localized charge domains on controlling bacterial adhesion to surfaces 61 . However , for studies that aim at quantifying the bacterial adhesion to inert surfaces specifically , a low number of 136 measurement points on the bacterial cell surface seems to be sufficient to represent the individual cell surface . 3 . 4 . 2 Cell - Cell Heterogeneities . Due to the time associated with performing AFM experiments on bacterial cells , a limited number of bacterial cells are generally investigated in AFM experiments . Quite often , around 10 cells per treatment condition are generally investigated 55 , 62 , 63 . What is not generally reported is whether cells investigated belonged to the same culture or not and how important it is to investigate cells from different cultures to obtain statistically meaningful AFM data . With few exceptions 12 , 15 , 25 , variations from cell to cell are usually not discussed in the literature . Generally , the data collected from all cells get addressed in a comprehensive manner and a histogram that represents variability in the measurements is generally reported for the ensemble of cells 6 , 64 , 65 . In this study , we asked the question of how bacterial adhesion energy measurements vary from one cell to another and between cells that shared the same culture or cultivated from different cultures . To address the questions above , we cultivated 10 - 26 cells from two to three different cultures for each of the 12 Listeria strains investigated . Our results indicate for all strains investigated that cells vary significantly in their properties even if they were taken from the same culture . They do vary as well when they belong to different cultures . Our results thus indicate that it is very important in AFM measurements of bacterial properties and interaction to investigate bacterial cells from different cultures . Our 137 results are consistent with a previous study in which the authors concluded that investigating bacterial cells from different cultures is more important to the reliability of the bacterial adhesion measurements than investigating variable number of locations on bacterial cell surfaces with less cultures 56 . Cell to cell variability might even become more important to account for in clinical investigations where specific growth conditions of bacterial cells are not controlled . 3 . 4 . 3 Strain - Strain Heterogeneity . Studies that utilize AFM to probe of the behavior of a single bacterial strain 3 , 66 , 67 or the differences in behavior between a wild - type bacterial strain and a mutant - strain derived from the wild - type strain 68 - 71 are commonly reported in the literature . Investigating a range of bacterial strains using AFM is a difficult task because it requires significant time for data collection and analysis . AFM in its current technology is not well suited for investigations of a large number of cells and strains . In this study , we attempted to investigate the differences in adhesion energies between seven bacterial strains that belong to a certain species ( L . monocytogenes ) . These strains however did vary in their in vivo virulence characteristics . The adhesion energies quantified between L . monocytogenes strains that varied in virulence and silicon nitride in water correlated well with the LD50 values reported for the strains in mice . Previously , we have shown a similar correlation using adhesion forces 24 . Our results suggest that virulent strains are more capable of attaching to inert surfaces in vitro compared to avirulent strains . Enhanced binding of L . monocytogenes to inert surfaces is thus 138 related to the microbe pathogenicity . Stronger adhesion between virulent L . monocytogenes and inert surfaces is considered as the first step in the microbe’s route to infection 29 . Studies in the literature correlating virulence of L . monocytogenes with their macroscale adhesion to inert surfaces such as stainless steel 72 and polystyrene 57 have been conflicting . Heterogeneity in the virulence of L . monocytogenes has been observed in several in vivo ( mice ) and in vitro ( cell culture ) studies , but in most cases a clear correlation between the level of virulence and the origin or type characteristics of the strain could not be established 31 . Such studies points towards the important role of high - resolution studies such as AFM in quantifying bacterial adhesion to inert surfaces and in determining possible relationships between bacterial adherence and virulence . However , one barrier to overcome in AFM measurements is the interpretation of AFM force measurements . Large variations in the AFM forces are commonly reported in the literature 56 . In general , researchers report standard deviation , median , mean , range , number of data points and histograms of their data to showcase the large variations in the data 24 . Researchers sometimes go beyond basic statistical analysis in efforts to describe the heterogeneities observed in the AFM data . Examples include fitting the distribution histograms of AFM adhesion forces or energies to dynamic peak fitting functions such as Gaussian , normal , Poisson and Weibull functions 6 , 12 , 24 , 25 , 56 . Although using all the statistical tools above is interesting and useful , it does not address how strains compare in their heterogeneities to each other . In this study , we 139 have defined two heterogeneity indices that can be used to determine how each strain compares to another strain in heterogeneity . To check how useful are the heterogeneity measures defined in describing the heterogeneity in the adhesion energy data obtained for different L . monocytogenes strains , we have attempted to relate them to macroscale bacterial properties or unit operations such as virulence and adherence . Although reasonably good relationships were found between both heterogeneity indices and femto - Joule adhesion energies quantified using AFM and LD50 values quantified from mice virulence assays ( Figure 3 . 5 ) , the relationships found using the heterogeneity index defined on the basis of standard error of mean values ( HI 1 ) were of higher quality . Such observation indicates that investigating a larger number of cells per strain is going to give a better representative results and can be used thus to point to statistically significant conclusions . Our results that suggest the presence of a relationship between heterogeneity indices and virulence and adherence of L . monocytogenes strains agree well with previously published reports . First , virulent strains of L . monocytogenes are known for their ability to express a larger set of surface proteins compared to avirulent strains 31 . For example , it is well accepted that virulent L . monocytogenes strains express listeriolysin - O ( LLO ) , a surface protein that is known as a virulence vector for L . monocytogenes and has a specific role in the microbe internalization 140 route in vivo while avirulent L . monocytogenes strains such as ATCC 15313 does not express LLO 54 . As the surface of a microbe increases the variety of proteins displayed on its surface , the heterogeneities in adhesion measurements will be expected to increase . Similarly , if the microbe expresses more molecules of its surface , the number of molecules that will interact with an AFM cantilever will increase leading to a higher adhesion energies quantified . Therefore , more proteins on the surface of L . monocytogenes will lead to larger adhesion . The expression of more surface virulence vectors on the virulent L . monocytogenes strains compared to the avirulent strains leads to more heterogeneities and correlate with the microbe ability to be virulent . Several studies in the literature realized the importance of investigating various types of bacterial strains to generalize conclusions . For example , AFM adhesion forces were measured between silica and three other metal oxides and five different Gram - negative bacterial strains including Escherichia coli strains with well known lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) structures , Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains that differ in extracellular polysaccharides ( EPS ) production and Burkholderia cepacia 73 . According to the authors , no correlation was found between the average adhesion forces measured using AFM and macroscopic adhesion tests performed using the five strains of bacteria . However , when only the 5 % strongest adhesion forces from the AFM data were considered , a good correlation was found between the nanoscale and macroscale adhesion tests . In another study , the distribution in adhesion force measurements was described 141 using a Weibull analysis 56 . Adhesion forces were measured between AFM tips that varied in geometry , chemistry or biology and a waterborne pathogen , Raoultella terrigena ATCC33527 , pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus 835 and Lactobacillus crispatus probe and a urogenital pathogen S . aureus MN8 . The authors concluded that the Weibull distribution is a useful new way in describing the heterogeneities in AFM adhesion force data 56 . In a third study , the adhesion of nine O - antigen expressing E . coli strains and three control strains that lacked O - antigen to an antimicrobial peptide cecropin P1 were quantified in controlled buffer solution 74 . According to the authors , a relationship was found between the strength of adhesion forces measured by AFM and the length of the bacterial LPS molecules 74 . 3 . 4 . 4 Species - Species Heterogeneities . To our knowledge , this is the first study in the literature that probes bacterial cells representative of all species of a bacterial genus at the nanoscale level . The genus Listeria was chosen for this purpose because it is only compromised of six species . This allows us to investigate how representative strains of each species vary among each other in their femto - Joule adhesion energies to inert surface of silicon nitride in water . One question that we aimed at answering was do virulent and avirulent species of Listeria share similar adhesion characteristics to inert surfaces . The strains investigated were thus grouped into two sub - categories according to their virulence . Most of the L . monocytogenes strains and the L . ivanovii strain were placed in the virulent category . Other Listeria species including those of seeligeri , 142 grayi , welshemeri and innocua were placed in the avirulent category . L . monocytogenes ATCC 15313 known as avirulent L . monocytogenes strain was also added to the avirulent strains investigated ( Table 3 . 1 ) . When compared , the adhesion energies of all virulent species were approximately twice the adhesion energies of the avirulent species . The higher adhesion energies reported for the virulent species were also associated with larger heterogeneities as indicated by larger HI 1 and HI 2 values for the virulent species compared to the avirulent species . This is consistent with our findings on L . monocytogenes strains alone which indicated that as the virulence of a strain increased , the adhesion and heterogeneities in adhesion measurements increased as well . Our findings here are consistent with variations in the surface composition of virulent and avirulent Listeria species . For example , L . monocytogenes EGDe encodes a total of 133 surface proteins which accounts for approximately 4 . 7 % of the coding capacity of the whole bacterium genome . In comparison , 22 . 6 % of cell - surface protein encoding genes are absent from L . innocua CLIP 11262 , whereas only 9 . 5 % of the total L . monocytogenes genes are absent from L . innocua , indicating that the main differences between these two species lie in their surface protein composition . The abundance of the virulent L . monocytogenes surface proteins in comparison to the avirulent L . innocua is probably a key contributor to the larger heterogeneity observed for the virulent species compared to the avirulent species . The larger surface protein 143 composition as well is likely related to the ability of the virulent species to interact with a large variety of inert and biotic surfaces 75 . According to DNA homology values as well as to 16S rRNA cataloguing results , Listeria species can be classified into two categories with all Listeria species being closely related and differs from L . grayi 76 , 77 . This can be the reason for why L . grayi showed higher femto - Joule adhesion energies ( 0 . 12 fJ ) compared to all the other avirulent Listeria species ( Table 3 . 1 ) . When compared , both L . monocytogenes and L . ivanovii can cause animal infections and are typical facultative parasites , L . monocytogenes can infect a wide range of animal species , including mammals and birds while L . ivanovii has a narrower host range , being pathogenic mostly for ruminants 31 . The fact that L . ivannovi are of lower virulence abilities compared to L . monocytogenes is consistent with our findings that indicate that virulent Listeria species are characterized by larger adhesion energies compared to less - virulent species . As can be seen from Table 3 . 1 , the adhesion energy of L . ivanovii to silicon nitride in water is lower than the adhesion energies reported for all virulent L . monocytogenes strains to silicon nitride in water ( Table 3 . 1 ) . To describe the heterogeneities observed for virulent and avirulent species , we applied a log - normal dynamic peak function to our data ( Figure 3 . 7 ) . The model was able to fit the adhesion energy data measured for virulent and avirulent species very well . We have chosen the log - normal peak function because it is known to be well suited for measurements that show more 144 or less a skewed distribution such as AFM data in general and bacterial adhesion AFM measurements in particular . Skewed distributions are common when the variations in the measurements are large . Often biological mechanisms include log - normal distributions with bacterial growth , latent periods to acquire infections and survival periods after people are diagnosed with cancer are few examples 78 . We have previously shown the ability of the log - normal model to fit the distribution of bacterial adhesion forces quantified by AFM 24 . Other models that have been used in the literature to describe distributions in AFM data include the normal , Gaussian , Gamma and Weibull models 6 , 24 , 56 , 73 . 3 . 4 . 5 Magnitudes of Adhesion Energies Quantified for Listeria species . In our study , adhesion energies quantified ranged from 0 . 039 fJ for L . inncoua 415 to 0 . 168 fJ for L . monocytogenes EGDe . In the literature , few studies have quantified the adhesion of bacteria to surfaces in terms of adhesion energies . When compared to such studies , the magnitudes of adhesion energies quantified between Listeria species and silicon nitride in water agreed well with the reported adhesion energy values for other bacterial species . For example , the interactions between Shewanella oneidensis and goethite in aerobic solutions were found to be between 0 . 026 fJ after 5 minutes of contact time between the two before the AFM measurements 79 . Another example is given by the interaction energies quantified between non - co - aggregating pairs of Actinomyces naeslundii 147 which were found to be 0 . 146 fJ and 0 . 233 fJ in 22 o C and 40 o C , respectively 80 . 145 3 . 4 . 6 Remarks on Sources of Heterogeneity in AFM Bacterial Adhesion Measurements . Although AFM measurements of bacterial interactions to surfaces are really interesting , interpreting them can be challenging due to the large variations generally reported in the adhesion forces or energies quantified between bacteria and surfaces . The sources of heterogeneities in the AFM measurements can be physical , chemical , biological , and practical sources . Physical heterogeneities can arise from the fact that the AFM cantilever can interact with variable surface molecules every time . Bacterial surfaces are known to be composed of many types of surface molecules including lipopolysaccharides , glycoproteins , lipids , surface proteins , and sometimes even an extra layer of extracellular polysaccharides 57 . The complexity of the bacterial surface is a main reason of the heterogeneities observed in the AFM adhesion energy measurements 75 , 81 , 82 . Physical heterogeneities can also arise from variable contact areas between the AFM tip and the bacterial surface at different force measurements . Note that the AFM tip is large in size compared to the size of the bacterial surface biopolymers and thus will most likely contact a number of bacterial surface biopolymers rather than contacting one biopolymer chain 25 . Depending on the types , charges and hydrophobicity of the molecules the AFM tip contacts , the strength of the adhesion interactions will be variable 15 . The actual contact area between the bacterium and the AFM tip will also depend on the applied load as well as on the size of the asperities on the bacterial surface and on the tip . Physical contact as well between 146 the bacterial molecules and the AFM cantilever deviates from the definition of continuum surfaces . The interactions generally reflect the nature of specific molecules on the bacterial surface . An AFM tip can contact many molecules at once as well as can contact a single molecule in more than one specific way . The heterogeneity is thus largely affected by the stochastic nature of the behavior of bacterial surface biopolymers . The use of colloidal AFM probe was shown to reduce the heterogeneities observed in bacterial adhesion measurements compared to when a nanoscale size tip was used . The authors suggested that the continuum averaging of the adhesion forces over larger molecules when the colloidal tip was used resulted in lower adhesion variations compared to the localized adhesion forces obtained using a sharp AFM tip 73 . Chemical heterogeneities are the result of the different types of biopolymers that are present on the bacterial surface . A cell is generally composed of many types of biopolymers that may vary in their chemical composition 57 . The molecules might as well vary in their conformational properties with time and thus display or hide certain chemical groups from their surfaces . For example , annotation of the first L . monocytogenes genome ( strain EGDe ) predicted a total of 2 , 853 proteins , among which were 133 surface proteins that were precisely classified according to their different anchoring systems and potential structural domains 83 . Biological heterogeneities may arise from differences between cells . Cells vary from each other in the types 147 of molecules they express on their surfaces . Although in our experiments , the phase at which cells were cultivated and the ways by which cells were washed and treated prior to AFM measurements were tightly controlled , cells were still different . It is well known that cells produce different molecules at different stages of growth 84 . Therefore , if cells happen to be marginally different in their phase at the time of cultivation , they will behave differently . Finally , practical problems such as signal to noise ratio , funny - shaped adhesion peaks and statistical processing could all lead to heterogeneities in the AFM measurements . 3 . 5 Conclusions AFM was successfully used to quantify the heterogeneities in the adhesion energies of bacterial cells that belonged to various types of Listeria to a model surface of silicon nitride in water at four different levels . In addition , the adhesion energies were correlated with the bacterial cells virulence properties . Our results indicated that spacial variations in the adhesion energies quantified at the single cell level were not important in determining the adhesion energy for a particular cell to silicon nitride . Our results however indicated that cell - cell variability was evident irrespective of the bacterial strain investigated and cells varied among each other even when they were cultivated from a single culture . Heterogeneities in the adhesion energies were found to increase as the adhesion energy quantified for a specific cell increased as well . Adhesion energies quantified for cells that belonged to different L . monocytogenes strains that 148 varied in their virulence were found to logarithmically correlate with the strain in vivo virulence . The heterogeneities quantified for the different L . monocytogenes strains were shown to correlate linearly and logarithmically with the strength of adhesion energy and with the strain virulence , respectively . For the first time in the literature , we have probed as well the adhesion energies between bacterial cells that represent all species of a bacterial genus ( Listeria ) and silicon nitride model surface in water . Our results indicated that all virulent species of Listeria were characterized by larger adhesion energies to silicon nitride and by more heterogeneous energies as well compared to the avirulent strains . The ability of AFM adhesion energies to distinguish virulent from avirulent cells and species can be utilized to design better tools to classify pathogenic Listeria species from non - pathogenic Listeria species . Finally , the approach developed here to quantify heterogeneities in bacterial adhesion measurements can be used to describe heterogeneities in other AFM interaction measurements on viral cells , mammalian cells and even single molecules . 3 . 6 Acknowledgements We would like to thank Prof .

The nanomechanical properties of the various L . monocytogenes strains were quantified in terms of Young’s moduli of cells . To estimate Young’s moduli , the classic Hertz model of contact mechanics and a modified version of it that takes into account substrate effects were used to fit the AFM nanoindentation - force measurements collected while pushing onto the bacterial surface biopolymer brush . When compared , the classic Hertz model always predicted higher Young’s moduli values of bacterial cell elasticity compared to the modified Hertz model . On average , the modified Hertz model showed that virulent strains are approximately twice as rigid ( 88 . 1 ± 14 . 5 kPa ) as the avirulent strains ( 47 . 3 ± 7 . 6 kPa ) . To quantify the conformational properties of L . monocytogenes ’ strains surface biopolymers , two models were used . First , the entropic - based , statistical mechanical , random walk formulation , the wormlike chain ( WLC ) model was used to estimate the elastic properties of the bacterial surface molecules . The WLC model results indicated that the virulent strains are characterized by a more flexible surface biopolymers as indicated by shorter persistence lengths ( L p = 0 . 21 ± 0 . 08 nm ) compared to the avirulent strains ( L p = 0 . 24 ± 0 . 14 nm ) . Second , a steric model developed to describe the repulsive forces measured between the AFM tip and bacterial surface biopolymers indicated that the virulent strains are characterized by crowded and longer biopolymer brushes compared to those of the avirulent strains . Finally , scaling relationships developed for grafted polyelectrolyte brushes indicated L . monocytogenes strains’ biopolymer brushes are charged . Collectively , our data 166 indicate that the conformational properties of the bacterial surface biopolymers and their surface densities play an important role in controlling the overall bacterial cell elasticity . Keywords Elasticity , Hertz model , AFM , Young’s modulus , Nanoindentation , Steric model , WLC model , L . monocytogenes , and Scaling relationships . 167 4 . 1 Introduction Listeria monocytogenes are Gram - positive food - borne bacteria responsible for an array of infectious diseases including fatal listeriosis 1 , 2 . L . monocytogenes are motile via flagella below 30 o C , but at temperatures above 30 o C such as those in vivo , they lose their motility and their mechanical properties adapt to their intracellular life functions 3 - 5 . The overall mechanical properties of L . monocytogenes are largely affected by their cell wall composition 6 . The cell wall of L . monocytogenes is composed of 20 % lipids , 40 % common amino acids , 6 % amino sugars , 29 % neutral sugars , and 5 % phosphate . All percentages are on the basis of dry cell mass 7 , 8 . The role of bacterial cell wall composition and molecules in controlling the biological 9 and chemical 10 properties of L . monocytogenes has been well documented in the literature . However , the role of bacterial cell wall molecules in controlling the mechanical properties of virulent and avirulent L . monocytogenes is still lacking . The mechanical properties of Gram - positive bacterial cells are generally affected by the osmotic pressure of the cell 11 , 12 , the rigidity of cellular membrane 13 - 15 , and the biopolymer composition of bacterial surface 16 - 18 . The contribution of each of the above three factors to the overall cell mechanical properties will largely depend on the environmental conditions in which bacteria reside 19 , 20 . The overall nanomechanical properties of bacterial cells can be quantified using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) nanoindentation measurements . The use of AFM as a powerful tool to probe elastic properties of Gram - negative bacterial cells such as Escherichia coli JM109 and Shewanella putrefaciens is well documented in the literature 20 - 26 . However , the use of AFM to probe the elasticity of Gram - positive bacterial cells has been rarely reported . A demonstration of the use of AFM to probe the elasticity of Gram - positive bacterial cells reported on Staphylococcus aureus before and after treatment with chitooligosaccharide in air 27 . The 168 nanoindentation results revealed a reduction in cell wall stiffness after chitooligosaccharide treatment . Similarly , AFM was used to probe the elasticity of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains in PBS buffer 28 . The results of the later study showed that the CMPG5413 mutant impaired in adherence , biofilm formation , and polysaccharide production was approximately twice as rigid as the LGG wild - type strain . In addition to quantifying the overall elastic modulus of the bacterial cell , the elastic properties of bacterial surface biopolymers can be quantified using entropic - based statistical mechanical random walk formulation models of chain elasticity 29 . The two most commonly models used to describe biopolymer chain elasticity are the freely jointed chain ( FJC ) and the wormlike chain ( WLC ) models 30 , 31 . While both models can predict entropic biopolymer elasticity , the FJC model is preferred for studying polysaccharides’ elasticities and the WLC model is preferred for studying the elasticities of stiffer biopolymers such as proteins and DNA 29 , 32 - 34 . However , irrespective of the model used to quantify biopolymer elasticity , both models predict similar biopolymer elasticities . The Kuhn length estimated by the FJC is usually twice that of the persistence length estimated for the same chain using the WLC 29 . In this study , since more than half of the cell wall of virulent L . monocytogenes is composed of proteins 8 and since the peptidoglycans layer on L . monocytogenes is considered to be composed of stiff molecules , the WLC was chosen to be used in the current study 35 . Finally , the conformational properties of the bacterial surface biopolymer brush can be quantified using a model developed to describe steric interactions measured between the AFM tip and a high - density polymer surface 36 , 37 . When fit to the approach distance - force data , the model can be used to estimate the bacterial surface biopolymer brush thickness and the grafting density of the bacterial surface biopolymers . 169 In this study , we are interested in quantifying the elastic properties of virulent and avirulent L . monocytogenes model strains . In addition , we are interested in investigating the crucial role played by bacterial surface biopolymers in bacterial elasticity . Understanding the elasticity of bacterial cells is challenging due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the bacterial cell wall composition . Motivated by this challenge , we will combine existing models of cellular elasticity with insights from single molecule biophysics to shed the light in a comprehensive manner on Gram - positive bacterial cell elasticity . 4 . 2 Materials and Methods 4 . 2 . 1 Bacterial Cultures . Four Listeria monocytogenes strains that vary in their virulence were used in our experiments ( Table 4 . 1 ) . All strains used were obtained from Dr . Mark Lawrence at the Department of Basic Sciences at Mississippi State University , MS except for the ATCC 51776 which was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) 38 . All cells were grown at 30 ˚ C and 150 rpm in brain heart infusion ( BHI ) broth adjusted to a pH value of 6 . 0 using 2 N HCl solution for 12 hours to activate the cells 39 . After activation of cells , 1 % of culture was transferred into triplicate of 20 ml of BHI broth and grown at the same conditions above and harvested when they reached the late exponential phase of growth . 4 . 2 . 2 Immobilization of L . monocytogenes for AFM Measurements . Prior to AFM measurements , bacterial cells grown until late exponential phase of growth and centrifuged twice at 5100 rpm for 10 minutes were attached to gelatin - coated mica disks 40 . Briefly , a mica disk ( Ted Pella , Inc . ) was cleaved five times on both sides to obtain fresh surfaces and then gelatin - coated by dipping into a gelatin solution prepared by dissolving 0 . 5 g of gelatin ( Sigma G6144 ) in 100 ml ultra - pure deionized water at 60 o C and then cooled to 40 o C . The gelatin - coated mica disks were allowed to air - dry overnight by standing on edge on a paper towel . After drying , a 20 170 µ l aliquot of bacterial suspension was pipetted onto the gelatin - coated disk and allowed to stand for 10 minutes for the attachment to occur between the bacteria and the gelatin at room temperature . The disks were then rinsed gently with DI water and used directly . 4 . 2 . 3 Atomic Force Microscopy . All AFM experiments were performed with a PicoForce™ scanning probe microscope with Nanoscope IIIa controller and extender module ( Veeco Inc . , Santa Barbara , CA ) . Silicon nitride cantilevers ( DNP - S , Veeco Inc . , Santa Barbara , CA ) were used in all experiments . The force constant of each cantilever was determined at the beginning of each experiment from the power spectral density of the thermal noise fluctuations in DI water 41 . On average , the spring constant was found to be 0 . 07 ± 0 . 01 N / m ( n = 6 ) . Prior to force measurements , L . monocytogenes were imaged in TappingMode™ under DI water . Real - time images were used to locate the cells , ensure the cells population homogeneity , and correct morphology . We have chosen to perform our measurements under water since we are interested in quantifying how L . monocytogenes mechanical properties vary in vitro . Water is the main solvent used in the food processing industries and the main solvent used in preparing foods 42 , both of which are considered as two common processes during which L . monocytogenes strains contaminate food . Contamination of food is considered as the first step towards L . monocytogenes infections 43 . 4 . 2 . 4 AFM Force Measurements . For all strains investigated , fifteen cells from three different cultures were examined . For each bacterial cell , force measurements were performed on fifteen locations selected using the point and shoot feature of the AFM software to cover all bacterial cell surface . In general , AFM measures forces between bacterial surface biopolymers and the AFM cantilever in a cycle that consists of an approach curve recorded upon the probe approaching the surface ( Figure 4 . 1A , raw data ) and a retraction curve recorded upon the probe 171 is moving away from the surface ( Figure 4 . 1D , converted data ) . Approach and retraction curves were measured at a rate of 580 nm / sec to minimize the hydrodynamic drag forces 44 and a resolution of 4096 points . When analyzed , the approach curves were averaged because of the minimal variation observed between individual curves . Retraction curves however , were considered individually due to observed heterogeneity in the measured forces .

A ) A typical approach curve measured between the AFM tip and the bacterial surface biopolymer brush of ATCC 51776 . The curve is shown as raw data in terms of the relationship between piezo displacement ( h ) and cantilever deflection ( d ) . The d 0 value represents the deflection offset that was subtracted from all deflection data prior to conversion of the raw deflection data to force data . B ) This curve represents the change in slope of the curve in Figure 4 . 1A as a function of piezo displacement . Note that the contact point between the tip and the bacterial surface biopolymer brush was taken as the initial value at which the slope of this curve changed from zero ( h o = - 110 nm ) . C ) The force - indentation file that results from the treatments done in Figures 4 . 1A and 4 . 1B as described in the methods section . This curve is an example of curves fitted to the classic and modified Hertz models . D ) A typical AFM retraction curve measured between L . monocytogenes ATCC 51776 surface biopolymers and silicon nitride . The solid gray line represents the zero force baseline . Finally , the dotted grey lines that show up on the retraction curve represent the portions of the retraction curves being stretched . AFM approach raw piezo position - deflection data files ( example in Figure 4 . 1A ) were converted to force - indentation files ( example in Figure 4 . 1C ) as described previously 20 , 21 . It is worth mentioning though that the contact point between the tip and the bacterial surface biopolymers ( h 0 ) was defined following the approach taken by Mahaffy et al . as the point at Separation Distance ( nm ) 0 300 600 900 F o r c e ( n N ) - 1 . 0 - 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 Retraction Curve Baseline D ) 174 which the force curve initially changed its slope ( Figure 4 . 1B ) 45 . The deflection offset ( d o ) and the piezo displacement offset ( h o ) were subtracted from deflection and piezo displacement values ( Figure 4 . 1A ) , respectively . To create a force – indentation curve ( Figure 4 . 1C ) , the compliance of the sample is taken into account . On a stiff sample , the slope of the compliance region of the force – indentation curve is expected to be 1 , but this slope is < 1 for soft biological samples . The indentation depth is the difference between the separation distance that would be obtained ( between the tip and the sample ) on a hard surface compared to the separation distance obtained for a soft sample , and is defined by : δ = ( h − h o ) − ( d − d o ) ( 4 . 1 ) Cantilever deflection is converted to force ( F ) using Hooke’s law , with the knowledge of the spring constant of the cantilever , K c , as F = K c ( d − d o ) ( 4 . 2 ) Precise determination of the contact point ( h o ) between an AFM tip and a soft biological surface such as the bacterial biopolymer brush has been a proven to be a challenging task for all researchers working with soft samples . This is mainly because the contact point will be largely affected by the force applied by the cantilever on the surface being studied , the heterogeneity in the mechanical properties of the surface indented , and the nature of interactions between the tip and the surface of interest . The later is mainly problematic if strong attractive forces were observed upon approach between the tip and the sample . In our case , the bacterial surfaces studied ( data not shown ) and the AFM tips used are negatively charged leading to a net of repulsive forces between the tip and the bacterial surfaces 46 . The repulsive forces are mainly the result of electro - steric forces with a minimal contribution from Derjaguin - Landau - Verwey - Overbeek ( DLVO ) interactions 47 . The nature of the forces leading to repulsive forces upon 175 approach is not a factor in determining the contact point . The magnitude of the repulsive forces are important however , and taken into account in our methodology for determining the contact point . Finally , to address the first two effects on the contact point , we applied approximately constant loads to our bacterial surfaces across all indentation measurements . To describe heterogeneity effects , we have indented the bacterial surface on fifteen locations that cover the entire bacterial surface . 4 . 2 . 5 Thickness of Thin Gelatin Film . To measure the thickness of the gelatin film coating the mica surface , gelatin films were carefully scored with a razor blade tip , removing only the gelatin film . The gelatin film thickness was determined from cross - sectional analysis of AFM height images taken at the boundary between the scratched and non - scratched regions as the difference in heights between that of the gelatin layer and that of the reference mica surface . The average height of the gelatin film was found to be 47 . 2 ± 5 . 7 nm ( n = 2 ) . 4 . 2 . 6 Elasticity of Bacterial Cells . Quantitative information on bacterial elasticity can be obtained from modeling the measured force - indentation data ( Figure 4 . 1C ) using both the classic Hertz ( equation 4 . 3 , Figure 4 . 3A ) and the modified Hertz ( equation 4 . 4 - 4 . 6 , Figure 4 . 3B ) models of contact mechanics 20 , 48 . According to the classic Hertz model , the indentation force ( F ) applied by a non - deformable sphere indenter ( the AFM silicon nitride tip ) required to indent a distance ( δ ) into an infinitely deformable elastic half space ( the bacterial surface ) is given by : 2 / 3 2 / 1 2 ) 1 ( 3 4 δ ν R E F − = ( 4 . 3 ) where E is the Young’s modulus of bacterium , R is the radius of the spherical indenter taken as 40 nm ( the average of manufacturer reported range of values for tip radius ) , and ν is the Poisson ratio of the bacterium 21 or gelatin film 49 taken as 0 . 5 . Young’s modulus of the bacterium is the only fitting parameter in equation 4 . 3 . In comparison , the modified Hertz model adds a 176 modification to the classic Hertz model described by equation 4 . 3 such that the indentation force ( F ) applied by a non - deformable sphere indenter ( the AFM silicon nitride tip ) required to indent a distance ( δ ) into a deformable elastic half space ( the bacterial surface ) of a finite thickness is given by 48 : ⎥⎦⎤ ⎢⎣⎡ ⎟⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎜⎝⎛ + + ⎟⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎜⎝⎛ + − + − × − = 4 0 2 30 4 0 3 0 2 30 3 2 2 0 0 2 / 3 2 / 1 2 5 3 16 15 4 8 4 2 1 ) 1 ( 3 4 χ β π α π α χ β π α π χ π α χ π α δ ν R E F ( 4 . 4 ) where H R / δ χ = , H is the thickness of the bacterial cell , and the constants α 0 and β 0 are functions of the sample Poisson ratio ( v ) and depend on whether or not the sample indented was bonded to the substrate beneath it or not . When the sample is not bonded to the surface , α 0 and β 0 are given by 48 : ν ν α − − − = 1 2 3 347 . 0 0 , ν ν β − − = 1 2 5 056 . 0 0 ( 4 . 5 ) and when the sample is bonded to the substrate , they are given by : ν ν ν α − + − − = 1 3442 . 1 4678 . 1 2876 . 1 2 0 , ν ν ν β − + − = 1 5164 . 1 0277 . 1 6387 . 0 2 0 ( 4 . 6 ) Note that both the classic and modified Hertz models are only valid for elastic surfaces in contact and do not take into account tip - surface adhesion . Therefore , since all approach curves measured in the current study between the AFM tip and the bacterial surface biopolymer brush displayed only repulsive interactions , the Hertz models could be applied with no problems . 4 . 2 . 7 Elasticity of Bacterial Surface Biopolymers . At zero force , polymer chains exist in coiled state to maximize their conformational freedom ( entropy ) . Extension of a relaxed chain generates 177 an opposing force that reduces the chain entropy 29 . This entropic elasticity of bacterial surface biopolymers can be described using statistical thermodynamic polymer elasticity models such as the Wormlike Chain ( WLC ) 50 . According to WLC , the polymer chain is an intermediate between a rigid rod and a flexible coil and considered to be continuously curved in random directions . The WLC model takes into account the local stiffness of the chain in terms of the persistence length ( L P ) and the long - range flexibility ( see inset in Figure 4 . 6A for description ) . The force ( F chain ) required to stretch a WLC chain to a length D is given by 30 : ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ ⎤ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ ⎡ − ⎟⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎜⎝⎛ − + − = 4 1 1 4 1 2 c c p B chain L D L D L T k F ( 4 . 7 ) Where k B is the Boltzmann constant , T is absolute temperature , L c is the biopolymer contour length taken as the total length of the polymer chain . The WLC model is usually applied to a portion of the retraction data ( grey dotted lines in Figure 4 . 1D ) 30 . These portions represent the force required to stretch a biopolymer chain to a distance D . In fitting the force - extension data , L p values were limited to those larger than 0 . 154 nm ( C - C bond length ) . 4 . 2 . 8 Determination of Biopolymer Brush Layer Thickness and Grafting Density . A model developed for grafted polymers at relatively high surface coverage was used to model steric interactions between the AFM tip and L . monocytogenes surface biopolymers . The force per unit area between two surfaces , F St , only one of which is coated with polymer , has been modeled following the work of Alexander 51 and de Gennes 52 . This model was modified by Butt et al . 53 to describe the forces between a spherical AFM tip and a flat surface by integrating the force per unit area over the tip surface , to produce the interaction force : ) / 2 ( 50 23 L h Exp RTL K F B St π − Γ = ( 4 . 8 ) 178 Where k B is Boltzmann constant , T is temperature , R is the tip radius taken as reported by the manufacturer ( 40 nm ) , Γ is the grafted polymer density in the brush layer ( m - 2 ) and reflects how much of the surface is covered by polymers , h is the distance between the two surfaces , and L is the equilibrium height of the polymer brush layer 47 . 4 . 2 . 9 Scaling Relationships for Grafted Polyelectrolyte Brushes . The steric model described above was developed for uncharged polymer brushes 47 . However , bacterial biopolymer brushes such as those on L . monocytogenes are frequently charged ( data not shown ) and can be modeled as grafted polyelectrolyte brushes . For uncharged polymer brushes , scaling theories developed based on self consistent field theory predict that the brush layer height ( L ) is proportional to Γ 1 / 3 51 . The behavior of charged polymer brushes deviates substantially from this relationship , especially at low ionic strengths such as those investigated here in water . To account for the behavior of charged polymer brushes , electrostatic blob models were developed 54 . Blob models account for excluded volume effects resulting from chain expansions due to interactions between the charged chains ( electrostatic , van der Waals , and steric ) , and some blob models can also be made to account for the elasticity of the biopolymers . For polyelectrolytes , the brush layer thickness was related to the excluded volume ( ν ) , the contour length of the polymer brush ( L c ) , the grafting density of the polymer brush ( Γ ) , and the Kuhn segment length ( L k ) through the relation L ~ L c ( ν Γ / L k ) 1 / 3 . The contour length is in turn related to the brush height . For the purpose of applying the grafted polyelectrolyte scaling relationship to the biopolymers of L . monocytogenes , we assumed that the polymer contour length would be related to the brush height , and the relationship L c = 1 . 25L was used . We could not use the L c values estimated from application of the WLC model to the AFM data because these “contour lengths” ( L c values ) represent the contour length of some region of the polymer chain that was stretched 47 . The AFM 179 tip may have come into contact with the polymer chain anywhere along its length ( i . e . , not necessarily at the end ) , and these contour length values will most likely represent the lengths of shorter sections of the chains , rather than the whole chain molecules . The arbitrary factor that we assumed ( 1 . 25 ) does not affect the observed relationships between contour length , polyelectrolyte grafting density and Kuhn length 47 . The excluded volume interaction parameter accounts for chain interactions . A version of the Daoud - Cotton model that was corrected for polymers attached to a spherical surface was used to calculate the excluded volume parameter ( ν ) 55 3 1 3 1 3 5 1 1 ν ⎟ ⎟⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎜⎝ ⎛ Γ + = ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ + k B c B L a kL a L ( 4 . 9 ) where k is a constant whose value is close to unity and a B is the bacterial strain radius estimated from 15 AFM images of bacterial individual cells taken under tapping mode in water . Values of L k were considered as twice those of L P values obtained from the application of the WLC model to the AFM retraction curves 29 , where an average L p value was found for each strain . L and Γ were obtained from applying the steric model ( equation 4 . 8 ) to AFM approach curves . 4 . 2 . 10 Statistical Description of AFM Data . The non - parametric group comparisons Mann - Whitney Rank Sum Test available in Sigma Stat 2 . 03 ( Jandel Scientific ) was applied to the measured data to determine if statistical variations were present between the two strains tested . Pair - wise multiple comparison procedure ( The Tukey test ) was sued to compare a certain parameter across all strains tested . The classic and modified Hertz , WLC , and steric models abilities to fit the experimental data were judged based on the estimated values of r 2 ( the coefficient of determination , often used to judge the adequacy of a regression model ) using the TableCurve fitting program ( Windows , version 1 . 11 , Jandel Scientific ) . 180 4 . 3 Results and Discussion 4 . 3 . 1 Thickness and Grafting Density of Bacterial Surface Biopolymer Brush . The presence of bacterial surface biopolymers caused electro - steric repulsions between the bacterium and the AFM tip . These forces were modeled using equation 4 . 8 ( Figure 4 . 2A ) to estimate the bacterial surface biopolymer brush thickness and grafting density ( Table 4 . 1 ) . The height of the bacterial surface biopolymer brush was longer for the virulent strains ( 176 . 5 ± 40 . 6 nm ) compared to the avirulent strains ( 137 . 2 ± 14 . 4 nm ) . Pair - wise multiple comparison procedure ( Tukey test ) indicated that the variations in the bacterial surface biopolymer brush thicknesses are statistically significant among strains that belong to different virulence categories ( p < 0 . 05 ) and not - statistically different among strains that belong to the same virulence category ( p > 0 . 05 ) . Similarly , the grafting density of the bacterial surface biopolymer brush was larger on the virulent strains ( 2 . 49 × 10 16 ± 0 . 36 × 10 16 biopolymers / m 2 ) compared to the avirulent strains ( 1 . 59 × 10 16 ± 0 . 19 × 10 16 biopolymers / m 2 ) ( Table 4 . 1 ) . Pair - wise multiple comparison procedure ( Tukey test ) indicated that the variations in the bacterial surface biopolymer grafting densities are statistically significant among strains that belong to different virulence categories ( p < 0 . 05 ) and not - statistically different among strains that belong to the same virulence category ( p > 0 . 05 ) . Larger grafting densities of virulent cells agree well with genetic studies that indicate that virulent L . monocytogenes strains have more proteinacious surfaces compared to avirulent L . monocytogenes strains 56 - 60 . 181 Distance ( nm ) 0 30 60 90 120 150 Fo r ce ( n N ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Virulent Strain 51776 Virulent Strain EGDe Avirulent Strain 15313 Avirulent Strain HCC25 Steric Model B ) 182 Figure 4 . 2 .

Grafting densities resulted from fitting the steric model to the approach curves collected on Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans were estimated to be between 3 . 4×10 16 and 7 . 1×10 16 moleules / m 2 37 . Previously , we have showed that the brush thickness and grafting density of surface molecules of E . coli JM109 46 and Pseudomonas putida KT2442 47 in water were 242 nm and 3 . 5×10 15 moleules / m 2 and 440 nm and 1 . 6×10 15 moleules / m 2 , respectively . Qualitatively , the steric model results are in good agreement with the cell heights obtained from tapping mode imaging results ( Table 4 . 1 ) . If one compares the two types of measurements , it is interesting to find that the height of the internal structural components of the cell taken as the difference between the height estimated from the tapping mode images minus the polymer brush thickness estimated from the steric model is relatively independent of the strain type ( Table 4 . 1 ) . However , the biopolymer brush layer thickness is a function of the L . monocytogenes strain type . 4 . 3 . 2 Scaling Relations for Grafted Polyelectrolyte Polymer Brushes . The steric model discussed above assumes the polymer brush modeled to be neutral 47 which is not the case for most bacterial surfaces 61 . For neutral polymer brushes on a solid surface , short - range intermolecular repulsion causes the chains to partially stretch in the direction normal to the grafting surface 51 . Polyelectrolyte polymer brushes such as those on the bacterial surface also stretch in the direction normal to the grafting surface , but the stretching is caused primarily by electrostatic interactions in the layer instead of short - range repulsion between individual units of the molecule 54 . To investigate whether the charge of the L . monocytogenes polymer brushes play an important role in their conformation , we applied both scaling relationships developed for 185 charged and uncharged brushes to our experimental data ( Figures 4 . 2B and 4 . 2C ) . For uncharged polymer brushes , scaling relationships predict that the polymer brush layer height can be correlated with Γ 1 / 3 51 . Figure 4 . 2B shows that the scaling relationship developed for the uncharged polymer brushes was quite satisfactory for our data ( r 2 = 0 . 85 ) . For charged polymer brushes , scaling relationships correlate the polymer brush height with L c ( Γ ν ) 1 / 3 L k - 1 / 3 . The polyelectrolyte model accounts for excluded volume interactions between adjacent “blobs” of the polymer chain and also accounts for the elastic properties of the polymers . Figure 4 . 2C shows that the scaling relationship developed for grafted polyelectrolyte brushes is in excellent agreement with our data ( r 2 = 1 . 0 ) . The validity of the polyelectrolyte scaling relationship confirms that the biopolymer brush layer on the surface of L . monocytogenes is charged . Our results here agree well with our previous study on Pseudomonas putida KT2442 which reported that the surface of P . putida KT2442 is charged as the scaling relationships developed for the grafted polyelectrolyte brushes fits the experimental data very well 47 . 4 . 3 . 4 Elasticity of Thin Gelatin Film . Prior to indentation measurements , L . monocytogenes cells were immobilized by adsorption on thin gelatin films . As a control , the elasticities of these thin gelatin films in water were determined using both the classic ( equation 4 . 3 , Figure 4 . 3A ) and modified Hertz ( equations 4 . 4 and 4 . 5 , Figure 4 . 3B ) models 48 ( Figure 4 . 4 ) . 186 Figure 4 . 3 . Schematics of the indentation experiments using A ) classic Hertz model and B ) modified Hertz model . In the schematics , F is the applied indentation force , δ is the bacterial cell indentation distance resulting upon applying the indentation force , and R is the radius of the indenter ( AFM tip ) . Note that the size of the indenter and the thickness of the bacteria and substrate are drawn not to scale for clarity purposes . Our results indicate that the Young’s modulus value obtained using the classic Hertz model ( 64 . 4 ± 6 . 5 kPa , n = 225 , r 2 = 0 . 98 ± 0 . 01 ) was three times that estimated using the modified Hertz model ( 21 . 9 ± 2 . 2 kPa , n = 225 , r 2 = 0 . 99 ± 0 . 00 ) ( results are statistically different , p < 0 . 05 , Mann - Whitney Rank Sum Test ) . The higher Young’s modulus value obtained using the classic Hertz model is not real and reflects mainly the contribution of the rigid mica ( E = 137 GPa ) to the gelatin film elasticity . Mica is the substrate lying below the thin gelatin film . However , when the thickness of the gelatin film was taken into account , the modified Hertz model predicted much lower elasticity values that agree well with values reported in the literature for relatively thick gelatin films ( > 1 µ m ) 49 . This comparison indicates that modified Hertz model is more appropriately suited to study the elasticity of soft samples that have a thickness lower than 1 µ m compared to the classic Hertz model .

The solid and dashed lines are the classic and modified Hertz models fits to the force - indentation data . 4 . 3 . 5 Elasticity of Virulent and Avirulent L . monocytogenes Cells . The elasticities of virulent and avirulent L . monocytogenes cells were determined from the indentation - force data using both the classic and modified Hertz models ( Table 4 . 1 ) . When the classic Hertz model was used to fit the indentation - force data measured on cells in water ( Figure 4 . 5 ) , virulent strains were found to be more rigid ( 97 . 6 ± 16 . 5 kPa , n = 450 , r 2 = 0 . 97 ± 0 . 02 ) compared to avirulent strains ( 52 . 4 ± 8 . 4 kPa , n = 450 , r 2 = 0 . 98 ± 0 . 02 ) . Pair - wise multiple comparison procedure ( Tukey test ) indicated that the variations in the Young’s moduli values are statistically significant among strains that belong to different virulence categories ( p < 0 . 05 ) and not - statistically different among strains that belong to the same virulence category ( p > 0 . 05 ) .

The solid black lines are the modified Hertz model fits to the force - indentation data while the dashed grey lines are the classic Hertz model fits to the data . To apply the modified Hertz model to the indentation - force data , the heights of the bacterial cells need to be accounted for . To estimate each bacterial strain height , we used AFM tapping mode to capture images of fifteen randomly selected cells of each of the virulent and avirulent strains of L . monocytogenes . The images were analyzed for their height using the cross - sectional offline feature available in the AFM software . Our results showed that virulent and avirulent L . monocytogenes strains have comparable heights ( 375 ± 70 nm , 367 ± 38 nm , n = 30 , respectively , Table 4 . 1 ) ( results are not statistically different , ( p = 0 . 081 > 0 . 05 , Mann - Whitney Rank Sum Test ) . When the modified Hertz model was used to fit the indentation - force data measured on cells in water ( equations 4 . 4 and 4 . 5 , Figure 4 . 5 ) , virulent strains were found to be more rigid ( 88 . 1 ± 14 . 5 kPa , n = 450 , r 2 = 0 . 98 ± 0 . 02 ) compared to avirulent strains ( 47 . 3 ± 7 . 6 189 kPa , n = 450 , r 2 = 0 . 98 ± 0 . 01 ) . Pair - wise multiple comparison procedure ( Tukey test ) indicated that the variations in the Young’s moduli values are statistically significant among strains that belong to different virulence categories ( p < 0 . 05 ) and not - statistically different among strains that belong to the same virulence category ( p > 0 . 05 ) . When the results of the classic and modified Hertz models were compared , the modified Hertz model always estimated relatively smaller Young’s moduli values compared to those obtained by the classic Hertz model . The slight differences in the values of Young’s moduli estimated using both models on three out of the four strains studied were not great enough to exclude the possibility that such differences are the result of random sample variability ( results are not statistically different , p = 0 . 097 , Mann - Whitney Rank Sum Test ) . Differences in the Young’s moduli values estimated for the avirulent ATCC 15313 strain using both models were statistically significant ( p = 0 . 016 , Mann - Whitney Rank Sum Test ) . The smaller Young’s moduli values obtained using the modified Hertz model are mainly the result of taking into account the bacterial cell thickness and thus minimizing the stiffening effect that can be observed in the classic Hertz model due to the underlying mica substrate . However , differences in Young ' s moduli values of bacterial cells estimated using both two models were not as profound as differences in the Young ' s moduli values of the gelatin film estimated using both models ( Figures 4 . 4 and 4 . 5 ) . This can be attributed to the combined effect of the relatively thick bacterial cell that makes it less affected by the substrates below and to the cushioning effect of the relatively thin gelatin film that separates bacterial cells from the rigid mica . The relatively small standard deviation values associated with the estimated Young’s moduli values are a strong indicator of the reproducibility of the indentation measurements and evidence on the consistency of Young’s moduli values among cells cultivated from independent 190 cell cultures . In addition , such small standard deviations indicate that the investigated sample size was statistically sufficient to represent the Young’s modulus of the bacterial surface . When compared , Young’s moduli values estimated for virulent strains spanned a larger range compared to those estimated for the avirulent strains . This larger range is expected due to the more heterogeneous proteinacious surface of virulent strains compared to avirulent strains as indicated by genetic studies 56 . When the steric repulsions measured between the AFM tip and the L . monocytogenes cell surface biopolymers were modeled using the steric model developed for grafted polymers at relatively high surface coverage 47 , brush thicknesses of L . monocytogenes virulent and avirulent strains were found to be less than 200 nm ( Figure 4 . 2 , Table 4 . 1 ) . In our experiments , applied forces to indent the bacterial cell wall were only sufficient to indent distances less than a 150 nm ( smaller than brush thickness estimated by the steric model ) ( Figures 4 . 2 and 4 . 5 ) . This indicates that indentation forces applied were used mainly to compress of the outer biopolymers’ brush of the cell wall . However , this does not mean that the role of membrane rigidity or cell turgor pressure is ignored in the estimated Young’s moduli values . We can think of the turgor pressure and the cytoskeleton elements lying beneath the membrane’ surface as additional substrate layers that can result in stiffening effects similar to those contributed by gelatin and mica . The results of the current study showed that virulent strains ( ATCC 51776 and EGDe ) were approximately twice as rigid as the avirulent strains ( ATCC 15313 and HCC25 ) . Our results correlate well with current knowledge of the surface structure of virulent and avirulent strains of L . monocytogenes in general . Genetic studies performed on L . monocytogenes strains indicate that virulent strains are characterized by a more proteinacious surface in comparison to avirulent strains 57 - 60 . The higher stiffness observed for the virulent L . monocytogenes strains compared to 191 the avirulent strains agrees well with our steric model results . The steric model indicated that the virulent L . monocytogenes strains were characterized by approximately 60 % higher grafting densities compared to the avirulent strains , leading to stiffer surfaces . Note that the thicknesses of internal structures of the avirulent strains are slightly longer than those of the virulent strains . At a constant indentation distance , this would mean that the estimated Young’s moduli for virulent strains will be potentially subjected more to the stiffening effects of the internal cellular structures compared to the Young’s moduli estimated for the avirulent strains . Previously , we have shown that the adhesion of L . monocytogenes bacterial biopolymer brush to silicon nitride AFM tips is positively correlated with L . monocytogenes strain virulence 62 . Extra stiffness for virulent L . monocytogenes strains compared to avirulent strains could therefore be implicitly correlated with the increased adhesion capabilities of the AFM tip to the virulent bacterial biopolymer brush compared to the biopolymers of the avirulent brush . Variations in the composition of the bacterial surface biopolymers can be a key factor in determining the mechanical properties of bacterial cells . Previously , AFM force measurements performed on pathogenic E . coli strain ( EAEC 042 pet ) and disperin knockout mutant of the same E . coli strain ( EAEC 042 aap ) indicated that the wild - type strain has a more rigid surface compared to the mutant that lacks disperin 22 . The Young’s moduli values of the L . monocytogenes strains obtained in the current study compare well with previously reported Young’s moduli values obtained for other bacterial strains using the classic Hertz model 20 , 26 , 28 . For example , Young’s moduli of Shewanella putrefaciens CIP 8040 measured in 0 . 1 M KNO 3 solution at two pH values ( 4 and 10 ) using a silicon nitride cantilever as an indenter were found to be 210 and 37 kPa , respectively 26 . Compared to the above study which was performed in 0 . 1 M KNO 3 , our study was performed under water . As the ionic strength of the media increases , 192 bacterial surface biopolymers were shown to collapse on the bacterial surface leading to a stiffer overall bacterial surface compared to a softer swollen bacterial surface expected in water ( lower ionic strength ) 47 . Another example is given by the study on probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG ( LGG ) and its derived mutant ( strain CMPG5413 ) . Young’s moduli of the wild and mutant strains were measured in PBS buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) using oxide - sharpened micro - fabricated silicon nitride cantilever . The mutant strain ( 184 ± 40 kPa ) appeared to be two times softer compared to the wild strain ( 300 ± 63 kPa ) . The authors suggested that different surface compositions resulted in the varied nanomechanical properties 28 . 4 . 3 . 6 Elasticity of Bacterial Surface Biopolymers . The WLC model of polymer elasticity was used to quantify the conformational properties of bacterial surface biopolymers ( equation 4 . 7 ) . Figures 4 . 6A through 4 . 6D show representative examples of how the WLC model was used to fit the force ( F ) needed to stretch a biopolymer chain to a certain distance ( D ) on the investigated virulent and avirulent strains of L . monocytogenes . It has to be noted here that the WLC model was only applied to 45 % and 51 % of the retraction data measured on the virulent and avirulent strains respectively . This is mainly because the WLC model is only applicable to stretching single molecule chains . The slightly higher chance for pulling single biopolymer chains on the avirulent strains compared to the virulent strain could be explained by the fact that their surfaces are less crowded by biopolymers as observed from the steric model fits ( Table 4 . 1 ) . 193 A ) Distance ( nm ) 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Fo r ce ( n N ) 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 Virulent Strain 51776 WLC Model D L P L P D L P L P DDD L P L P A ) Distance ( nm ) 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Fo r ce ( n N ) 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 Virulent Strain EGDe WLC Model B ) 194 Distance ( nm ) 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Fo r ce ( n N ) 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 Avirulent Strain 15313 WLC Model C ) Distance ( nm ) 0 100 200 300 400 500 Fo r ce ( n N ) 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 Avirulent Strain HCC25 WLC Model D ) 195 Persistence Length ( nm ) 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 P r ob a b ili t y o f O cc u r e n ces 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 Virulent Strain 15313 Virulent Strain EGDe Avirulent Strain 15313 Avirulent Strain HCC25 E ) Figure 4 . 6 .

Each solid line represents the fitting results of the WLC model to a stretching event of a bacterial surface biopolymer or a part of it and is characterized by its own values of persistence and contour lengths . Circles represent the experimental data . The inset on part A shows a schematic of a WLC chain . E ) Probability histogram that shows the distribution of persistence length values estimated using WLC model for all strains investigated . Based on our steric model grafting densities’ results and by assuming that the whole AFM tip surface ( sphere ) is in contact with the bacterial biopolymer brush , we can estimate that ~ 321 and 501 molecules of the bacterial surface biopolymers will be in contact with the AFM tip at one point of time for the avirulent and virulent strains , respectively . However , this scenario is not 196 always the case . As the cantilever retracts away from the bacterial surface biopolymer brush , biopolymers fall from the cantilever and single molecules can be stretched by the cantilever occasionally . Peaks that represent pulling of more than one molecule were determined as peaks with large force magnitudes and thus were excluded from the WLC analysis . Stretching single molecules usually requires forces on the order of few hundred pN 32 , 34 . If larger forces were observed , it is usually a strong indication that more than one chain was pulled by the AFM cantilever . The likelihood of pulling only single molecules would have been increased if the cantilever was tagged with a specific protein . However , in that case , we would be only probing the role of that specific protein on bacterial cell elasticity . Using bare silicon nitride cantilevers to stretch bacterial surface biopolymers increases the likelihood of pulling different molecules on the bacterial surface and thus more representative of the role of bacterial cell wall molecules on bacterial cell elasticity . In addition , the WLC model might fail to fit the data if the biopolymer chain was stretched beyond its contour length . Note that the WLC model ( equation 4 . 7 ) has a singularity at D = L c . Other statistical thermodynamic models of polymer elasticity such as extensible wormlike chain ( WLC + ) can be used in such cases 29 . Fitting the retraction data with the WLC + model may could have resulted in more data fits , however , WLC + requires much more extensive data analysis as it requires the use of numerical techniques to extract fitting parameters from the data 29 . The ability of the WLC model to fit approximately half the data does not imply that model is inapplicable to our data . It is however implying that only a subset of the data satisfies the model requirements and that subset fit the model very well . The persistence lengths of biopolymer chains taken from 15 cells of each strain estimated using the WLC model ranged from 0 . 16 nm to 0 . 60 nm ( mean 0 . 21 ± 0 . 08 nm , n = 197 296 ) for virulent strains and between 0 . 16 nm to 0 . 95 nm ( mean 0 . 24 ± 0 . 14 nm , n = 521 ) for avirulent strains ( Figure 4 . 6E ) . On average , the persistence length estimated for the virulent strains was lower than that estimated for the avirulent strains , indicating the presence of more flexible chains on the surfaces of virulent strains ( the differences in the median values among the treatment groups are greater than would be expected by chance ; there is a statistically significant difference ( p = 0 . 028 ) , Kruskal - Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks ) . The range of persistence lengths measured on all investigated L . monocytogenes strains indicates the heterogeneity of the biopolymers composing the bacterial surface 31 . The contour lengths ranged between 128 nm and 1810 nm ( mean 617 . 7 ± 296 . 0 nm ) for virulent strains and between 85 nm and 1280 nm ( mean 471 . 9 ± 200 . 3 nm ) for avirulent strains . The contour lengths estimated for the virulent strains were on average longer than those estimated for the avirulent strains . Pair - wise multiple comparison procedure ( Dunn’s method ) indicated that the contour lengths of surface biopolymers are statistically different among strains that belong to different levels of virulence ( p < 0 . 001 ) and are not statistically different among strains that belong to the same virulence category . Our contour length estimates are in good agreement with our longer brush thicknesses obtained using the steric model for the virulent strains compared to the avirulent strains ( Table 4 . 1 ) . Although contour lengths can be used as an indication on how far biopolymers extend from the bacterial surface , their estimated values are greatly affected by the distance at which the cantilever contacted the biopolymer chain 30 , 63 . Figure 4 . 6E shows that almost 71 % and 64 % of the biopolymer chains composing the virulent and avirulent strains’ surfaces were extremely flexible as they could be fitted with a persistence length between 0 . 16 nm and 0 . 21 nm , which is slightly higher than the C - C bond length ( 0 . 154 nm ) . Although all strains shared the presence of flexible polymers on their surface , 198 30 % of the biopolymer chains of the avirulent L . monocytogenes strains were stiff and had persistence lengths longer than 0 . 4 nm compared to only 11 % of the biopolymer chains of virulent L . monocytogenes strains . The estimated persistence lengths of the surface biopolymers of L . monocytogenes are similar to values observed for other bacterial surface biopolymers in the literature . For example , we have shown previously that the persistence length of the surface biopolymers of Pseudomonas putida KT2442 in water spanned a range of 0 . 154 nm to 0 . 28 nm indicating that bacterial surface polymers are very flexible 30 , 31 . In another study , when the WLC was used to quantify the elasticities of the surface biopolymers of the yeast strain Sacchrmoyces cerevisiae stretched using a lectin - modified tip , a range of persistence length values ( 0 . 03 to 0 . 56 nm ) were necessary to fit the retraction data with rupture lengths that are less than a 400 nm . The authors suggested that the range of persistence lengths observed is indicative of the fact that both oligosaccharides and polypeptide chains of the manno - proteins were stretched on S . cerevisiae . Note that in this study , unrealistic persistence length values were necessary to fit some of the data 64 . In a third study , the WLC model was applied to the AFM force - distance stretching profiles measured for E . coli surface biopolymers . The authors combined the AFM sawteeth signature force profiles observed in the retraction data and the WLC theoretical predictions of chain elasticity to predict the presence of two unique proteins on the bacterial surface 65 . In biopolymers with known structure , composition , and contour length , all the force - extension data can be normalized by the contour length of the biopolymer 50 . In the current study , the retraction data measured on both virulent and avirulent cells could not be normalized by the estimated contour lengths . Our inability to normalize the retraction data by a fixed contour length value indicates that the AFM cantilever stretched a wide array of bacterial surface biopolymers 199 and was not limited to a specific biopolymer type on the bacterial surface . 4 . 4 Implications for L . monocytogenes Nanomechanical Properties . Our results indicated that the virulent L . monocytogenes strains exhibited a more rigid surface at cellular level compared to the avirulent strains as indicated by the higher Young’s moduli values estimated using the classic and modified Hertz models . At the molecular level however , the virulent strains exhibited more flexible surface biopolymers compared to the avirulent strains . Finally , when repulsive steric forces measured between the AFM tip and the bacterial surface biopolymers of L . monocytogenes were modeled ( equation 4 . 8 ) , biopolymer brushes of virulent strains were longer and more crowded with surface molecules compared to those of avirulent strains’ . Applying scaling relations developed for grafted polyelectrolytes to our experimental data implied that the biopolymer brushes of L . monocytogenes strains investigated are charged . Collectively , our observations indicate that the conformational properties of the bacterial surface biopolymers and their surface densities and charge play an important role in controlling the overall bacterial cell elasticity . In addition , our data is suggestive of the presence of possible differences in the nanomechanical properties of virulent and avirulent strains of L . monocytogenes . 4 . 5 Acknowledgements We would like to thank Prof .

First , the work of adhesion was quantified for individual L . monocytogenes cells using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . Second , contact angle measurements combined with a thermodynamic - based harmonic mean model were used to quantify the work of adhesion for lawns of L . monocytogenes cells . In both cases , the work of adhesion was probed for pathogenic L . monocytogenes cells cultured cells under variable pH conditions of growth that ranged from pH 5 to pH 9 . Our results indicated that L . monocytogenes cells were able to grow under all investigated pH conditions ; indicating that the bacterial cells survived and adapted well to the chemical stresses applied . For all pH conditions investigated , we observed a transition in the generation time , physiochemical properties and bioadhesion for cells cultured in media adjusted to pH 7 of growth . In media with pH 7 , the generation time for the bacterial cells was lowest , the specific growth rate constant was highest , the cells were the most polar and bioadhesion magnitudes to silicon nitride in water for both individual and lawns of cells were highest as well . When compared , the work of adhesion values quantified between silicon nitride and lawns of L . monocytogenes cells ( HM W adh ) were linearly correlated with the work of adhesion values quantified between silicon nitride and individual L . monocytogenes cells ( AFM W adh ) according to : 2883 . 0 ) ( 1214 . 1 ) ( + × = fJ AFM W fJ HM W adh adh , r 2 = 0 . 923 . Such correlation indicates that AFM measurements of bacterial adhesion to inert surfaces using individual cells can be used to predict the macroscale adhesion behavior of lawns of cells . 211 5 . 1 Introduction Listeria monocytogenes are facultative intracellular , Gram - positive food - borne bacteria that are widely distributed in the environment 1 and can cause infectious diseases including fatal listeriosis and meningitis 2 - 4 . During food processing , harsh conditions such as low pH 5 , 6 , low and high temperatures 7 , 8 and high salt concentrations 9 , 10 are often used for food preservation or process sanitation at the same time or in sequence . L . monocytogenes are known for their ability to tolerate such harsh environments 9 , 11 , 12 . As a result , they remain residents of the microbial flora on those surfaces for months to decades . The efficacy of L . monocytogenes in causing large outbreaks is largely due to their ability to survive well in harsh environments . Similarly , once entered a human or an animal body via digestion of contaminated water or food , L . monocytogenes can invade the body through the gastrointestinal tract and further travel through the blood stream 10 , 13 . The in vivo route of L . monocytogenes to infection reflects the bacterial cells remarkable ability to adapt to a wide range of mammalian cells hostile environments with variable pH magnitudes 14 . Although very little is known with regards to the molecular mechanisms that explain L . monocytogenes resiliency and ability to survive in various environmental pH conditions in vivo , it is known that the L . monocytogenes adaptation protocols are associated with induced variations in the synthesis of certain cell components , especially proteins 15 , 16 . Previous studies have shown that L . monocytogenes secreted many novel proteins in response to acidic conditions . Such proteins were required for the bacteria to face lethal conditions 17 . In addition , external pH conditions were shown to control the expression of virulence and adhesive factors in L . monocytogenes such as extracellular hemolysin , listeriolysin O ( LLO ) , P60 and flagellin 18 , 19 . Although the role of changes in L . monocytogenes surface composition of virulence 212 vectors on the ability of the pathogen to be virulent is well studied under variable acidic conditions 15 , 17 , the role of these surface proteins and molecules in controlling the adhesion of L . monocytogenes to surfaces in vitro is not well understood . When bacterial cells in general attach to each other on a surface , they form well - structured cell cluster organization , named a biofilm . Biofilms are less sensitive to harsh environmental conditions 19 . Therefore , in vitro adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to inert surfaces and their in vivo attachment to biotic hosts can be considered as essential steps for their survival and successful route to establishing infections in environments with variable chemical conditions 19 . To improve our knowledge of how L . monocytogenes change their adhesion to inert surfaces under variable chemical conditions , the bioadhesion of L . monocytogenes to a model inert surface of silicon nitride was quantified in terms of work of adhesion for individual and lawns of L . monocytogenes cells using AFM and contact angle measurements , respectively . Silicon nitride was chosen as our model inert surface because it is characterized by a surface charge similar to each of soil and glass 20 . Both soil and glass are substrates to which L . monocytogenes frequently attaches to in nature 21 and during food processing 22 . To introduce chemical stresses , cells were grown under various pH conditions of growth ( pH = 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 ) . This pH range was chosen to mimic the acidity of environments in which L . monocytogenes can survive ex vivo and in vivo 23 , 24 . Ex vivo , L . monocytogenes can grow and survive in pH environments that range between 4 and 9 . 5 25 . In vivo , L . monocytogenes can grow and survive in pH environments that range between 2 - 3 . 5 in the stomach and 7 ~ 8 in the intestine 26 . The powerful use of AFM to probe the femto - Joule ( fJ ) work of adhesion that governs the interactions between bacterial cells and surfaces in liquid environments is evident in the literature 27 - 29 . The use of contact angle measurements to quantify the interfacial free energy 213 required for bacteria to adhere to surfaces is also described in the literature 30 - 32 . Although quantifying the work of adhesion between individual L . monocytogenes cells and model surfaces is important to detailing the mechanisms of bacterial survival in vitro under variable chemical conditions , a concern on whether such measurements will be able to predict how lawns of L . monocytogenes behave at the macroscale is always valid . Therefore , to bridge the gap between the two types of measurements , work of adhesion was quantified between individual L . monocytogenes cells grown in media adjusted to five different pH conditions and silicon nitride in water using AFM and using macroscale contact angle measurements combined with a thermodynamic - based harmonic mean model for lawns of L . monocytogenes cells . To our best knowledge , this study is the first in the literature to compare work of adhesion values on individual and lawns of cells under variable chemical conditions . 5 . 2 Materials and Methods 5 . 2 . 1 Bacterial Cultures . Pathogenic Listeria monocytogenes American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) 51776 was used in the current study 33 , 34 . The strain was activated by growing for twelve hours at 30 ˚ C on a shaker rotating at a 150 rpm in brain heart infusion broth ( BHIB ) adjusted to a pH value of 6 . 0 using 2N HCl 35 . Following the 12 hours , 1 % of the activated culture was transferred into 20 ml of BHIB adjusted to different pH values ( 5 . 0 , 6 . 0 , 7 . 0 , 8 . 0 and 9 . 0 ) using 2N HCl or 2N NaOH . Cells were harvested when the absorbance for each strain at 600 nm reached a constant value that correlated well with the number of single colonies enumerated on brain heart infusion agar plates incubated at 30 o C for 24 hours . For each pH condition tested , the log - transformed growth curve was collected and the specific growth rate constant ( µ , hour - 1 ) was quantified as the slope of the exponential phase data on the bacterial kinetics plot of the cell density in colony forming units ( CFU / ml ) versus time . The generation time was then calculated 214 as ln ( 2 ) / µ ( hour ) . 5 . 2 . 2 Contact Angle Measurements . Prior to contact angle measurements , 20 ml of bacterial cells suspended in BHIB growth media and grown as described above at the pH of interest were harvested and washed twice by centrifugation at 5525 g for 10 min each round . The collected bacterial pellet was then re - suspended in a 100 ml of filtered DI water . The 10 mL of bacterial solution was then filtered on a cellulose acetate filter ( pore diameter , 0 . 45 μ m , Sartorius , Aubagne , France ) using negative pressure . Bacterial densities on the membrane filters were determined to be between 1 × 10 7 – 5 × 10 7 cells per mm 2 . Such densities corresponded to 40 ~ 200 layers of bacteria covering the filter membrane . The bacterial density was determined by correlating the UV absorbance at 600 nm with the counted number of bacterial cells on a polycarbonate black membrane ( pore diameter 0 . 2 μ m , Whatman , Inc . , Clifton , N . J . ) under fluorescence microscopy according to procedures detailed elsewhere 36 . To establish constant moisture content , the filters with bacteria on them were placed in a Petri - dish on the surface of 1 % ( wt / vol ) agar prepared by dissolving Bacto agar ( Difco , Detroit , Michigan ) in filtered DI - water water containing 10 % ( vol / vol ) glycerol 37 . Drying time for L . monocytogenes lawns was determined to be ~ 40 min . The drying time is defined as the time required time for the water contact angles to reach a plateau and indicates that the cellular exterior moisture is evaporated while the cells are not dehydrated 38 . Prior to contact angle measurements , L . monocytogenes lawns prepared as described above were imaged by ContactMode AFM in air to ensure that the area of liquid drop was large enough compared to the roughness of the bacterial lawns . Using image processing software from Digital Instruments / Veeco , the mean surface roughness ( R a ) of the bacterial lawn was calculated as ∑ = − = n i i a Z Z n R 1 1 , where n is the total number of data points , Z i is the height of i th point , Z is the mean height 39 . The roughness values of bacterial 215 laws with 10 7 cells / mm 2 densities were measured over several areas that ranged from 10 × 10 , 20 × 20 , 30 × 30 to 50 × 50 µm 2 with a fixed pixel of 256 pixels per line and 256 lines per image . Roughness values were similar independent of the size of the areas over which they were quantified . On average , the surface roughness of bacterial lawns was 95 . 1 ± 3 . 1 nm ( n = 4 ) which was much smaller compared to the area occupied by the liquid drop of 2 µL volume ( equivalent to a radius of 1 . 45 mm ) applied on the bacterial lawns surface . The size of the drop is at least 15000 larger than the roughness of bacterial lawns . To quantify the contact angles of L . monocytogenes cells grown at various pH conditions , two probing liquids characterized with different polarities ( Table 5 . 1 ) were used . The liquids used were ultrapure water ( 18 . 2 M Ω ·cm resistivity , Millipore Mili - Q Plus , Billerica , MA ) and diiodomethane ( 99 % pure , Alfa Aesar , Ward Hill , MA ) . The contact angles of the bacterial lawns were quantified using the sessile drop technique 40 with a KR Ű SS DSA100 drop shape analysis system ( KR Ű SS GmbH , Hamburg , Germany ) . For each measurement , a 2 μ L droplet’ volume of the liquid of interest was used . For each liquid used , at least 30 measurements were performed . All measurements were made at room temperature and at ambient humidity .

Prior to AFM force measurements , bacterial cells grown until late exponential phase of growth in media adjusted to the pH condition of interest and centrifuged twice at 5525g for 10 minutes were attached to gelatin - coated mica disks according to the procedure detailed elsewhere 44 - 46 . All AFM force measurements were performed with a PicoForce™ Scanning Probe Microscope with a Nanoscope IIIa controller and extender module ( Veeco Inc . , Santa Barbara , CA ) under water . We have chosen to perform our measurements under water since we are interested in quantifying how L . monocytogenes strains attach to inert surfaces in vitro . Water is the main solvent used in the food processing industries and the main solvent used in preparing foods 47 . Silicon nitride cantilevers ( DNP - S , Veeco Inc . , Santa Barbara , CA ) were used in all experiments . The force constant of each cantilever was determined prior to force measurements from the power spectral density of the thermal noise fluctuations in DI water 48 . On average , the spring constant was found to be 0 . 065 ± 0 . 019 N / m ( n = 6 ) and and the maximum force on the sample surface was kept constant at 6 . 5 nN using the deflection trigger mode in the Veeco operating system . Prior to force measurements , L . monocytogenes images captured using TappingMode™ under DI water at a scan speed of 1 Hz at a resolution of 256 pixels per line and 256 lines per image were used to locate the cells , ensure the cells population homogeneity and appropriate morphology . Once a bacterial cell had been located via topographical scanning , the oscillation of the cantilever was stopped and the extending and retracting deflection - displacement curves measured between the bacterial surface biopolymers and the silicon nitride cantilever were captured using the AFM software . Force measurements were made on a bacteria - free area of the gelatin - coated mica disk before and after making a measurement on a bacterial cell . Equality of the measurements ensured that the tip properties had not been altered by contact with the 217 bacterial surface biopolymers . For each pH treatment of bacterial cells , at least fifteen cells from three different cultures were examined . For each bacterial cell , the point and shoot feature of the AFM software was used to locate fifteen spots on the bacterial surface to perform force measurements . Retraction curves were measured at a rate of 580 nm / sec to minimize the hydrodynamic drag forces 49 and at a resolution of 4096 points . 5 . 2 . 4 Analysis of Retraction Curves . Retraction curves were considered individually because of the complex and heterogeneous nature of interactions observed between the bacterial surface biopolymers and the AFM silicon nitride cantilever . Bacterial adhesion was quantified from the retraction curves in terms of bacterial work of adhesion in femto - Joules ( fJ ) . For each retraction curve , the work of adhesion was computed as the area under the retraction force - distance curve with the baseline taken at zero force ( Figure 5 . 1 ) . In general , force and work are correlated such as 50 : ∫ − = 2 1 ) ( h h adh Fdh AFM W ( 5 . 1 ) where W adh ( AFM ) is the work of adhesion quantified using AFM measurements , F is the pull - off force , and h is the separation distance . The negative sign was used to convert pull - off forces into adhesion forces . To quantify the work of adhesion , the integral in equation 5 . 1 was evaluated using the Trapezoidal rule ( equation 5 . 2 ) 50 . ) ] ( 2 ) ( ) ( [ ) ( 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 n h h k h F h F h F n h h Fdh AFM W n k h h adh − + + + − − ≈ − = ∑ ∫ − = ( 5 . 2 ) In equation 5 . 2 , 1 h and 2 h were taken as the first and last distance points at which the retraction curve crosses the zero force axis ( Figure 5 . 1 ) , n was equal to the number of data points collected per retraction force curve in the integral interval and varied from one curve to 218 another . In computing the integral in equation 5 . 1 , a uniform grid was always used 50 .

Example of an AFM retraction curve measured between a silicon nitride AFM cantilever and L . monocytogenes surface biopolymers in water . The gray shadowed area represents the work of adhesion or adhesion energy in fJ . The black arrows at the top of the curve indicate the bounds of integration where the adhesion energy was computed using equations 5 . 1 and 5 . 2 . 5 . 2 . 5 Interfacial Free Energy Calculations . For two surfaces at equilibrium and in contact , the net free energy of adhesion between the two surfaces can be described as a function of apolar and polar free energies . Free energies are related to the surface tension components of the two surfaces . The various surface tension components of the bacterial cell can be calculated from the contact angle measurements done on bacteria using the thermodynamic - based harmonic - mean ( HM ) model ; which was first proposed by Wu 51 . The HM model has been used in the literature to approximate interactions of low energetic phases with apolar ( dispersion , d γ ) and polar ( non - h 1 h 2 219 dispersion , p γ ) surface tension components ( equation 5 . 3 ) . The p γ is assumed to refer to all polar forces between the solid and liquid phases including dipole - dipole , dipole - induced dipole and hydrogen - bonding forces 52 . This model is useful for hydrophilic polysaccharides 53 and proteins 54 which are the major components of bacterial surfaces 55 .

The liquid components in equation ( 5 . 3 ) are known while the two unknowns in equation ( 5 . 3 ) are the interfacial tension components of the solid ( ds γ and ps γ ) , bacteria in our case . To quantify the solid components , contact angles have to be measured using two probing liquids , as described earlier in the contact angle measurements section . 5 . 2 . 6 Macroscopic Work of Adhesion . The obtained interfacial tensions for bacteria ( b ) , substrate ( s , silicon nitride in our study ) and liquid ( water , w ) allows for the calculation of the Gibbs free energy change upon adhesion ( adh G ∆ , mJ / m 2 ) between bacteria and silicon nitride in water as : 56 ( ) A G sw bw bs adh γ γ γ − − = ∆ ( 5 . 4 ) Where A is the contact area in m 2 between bacteria and silicon nitride . To calculate the area , the tip was considered as a paraboloid with a radius of curvature of 40 nm as provided by the manufacturer . The area of contact was estimated as 2 a A π = , where a is the contact radius calculated based on Hertz theory of contact mechanics and given by equations 5 . 5 and 5 . 6 57 , 58 . 220 3 / 1 ⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎝⎛ = K RF a l ( 5 . 5 ) 1 2 2 ] ) 1 ( ) 1 ( [ 3 4 − − + − = b b s s E E K ν ν ( 5 . 6 ) Where l F is the externally applied loading force taken as 6 . 5 nN . The applied force was always kept constant in our experiments using the deflection trigger mode . s E and b E are the elastic moduli of silicon nitride and bacterium taken as 155 GPa 59 and 101 kPa 45 , successively , s ν and b ν are Poisson’s ratios of silicon nitride and bacterium taken as 0 . 27 59 and 0 . 5 45 , successively . The resulting value of the area of contact using equations 5 . 5 and 5 . 6 was 4 . 02 x 10 - 14 m 2 . Going back to the basic principles of thermodynamics , the change in the Gibbs free energy is defined as the amount of energy available to do work 41 , 60 . Therefore , the macroscopic work of adhesion quantified between lawns of L . monocytogenes cells and silicon nitride in water is given by : adh adh G W ∆− = ( 5 . 7 ) The interfacial surface tension components shown in equation 5 . 4 can be calculated using the HM model ( equations 5 . 8 to 5 . 10 ) as shown below 61 : ⎥⎦⎤ ⎢⎣⎡ + − + = ds db d s d b ds db dbs γ γ γ γ γ γ γ 4 ( 5 . 8 ) ⎥⎦⎤ ⎢⎣⎡ + − + = ps pb ps pb ps pb pbs γ γ γ γ γ γ γ 4 ( 5 . 9 ) Pbs dbs bs γ γ γ + = ( 5 . 10 ) bw γ can be calculated analogically by replacing the “ s ” in the equations above by “ w ” while sw γ can be calculated by replacing the “ b ” in the equations above by “ w ” . Note that the Padh W and 221 dadh W can be calculated using equations 5 . 4 and 5 . 7 , however by using the polar or dispersive surface tension components , respectively in equation 5 . 4 . 5 . 3 Results and Discussion 5 . 3 . 1 Survival of L . monocytogenes under Chemical Stress . Although it is known that L . monocytogenes can survive in pH conditions from 4 . 0 to pH 9 . 5 25 , we could not observe significant growth of L . monocytogenes under pH 5 nor above pH 9 . However , as can be seen from Figures 5 . 2A and 5 . 2B , L . monocytogenes cells were able to grow well in all pH conditions investigated ( pH 5 to 9 ) . The cells varied in their kinetics of growth . First , the lag time varied from 3 hours at pH 5 and pH 6 to 2 hours at pH 7 and pH 8 to 4 hours at pH 9 . The longer lag times observed at the acidic and alkaline conditions indicate that the cells under extreme conditions had a tougher time adapting to the environment of growth . Similar durations for lag phases were also observed in the literature for L . monocytogenes cultured at 30 o C in various pH conditions with 2 . 64 and 0 . 64 hours reported for cells cultured in media adjusted to pH 5 . 5 and 7 . 4 , respectively 62 . Second , the specific growth rate constant taken as the slope of the data in Figure 5 . 2B for cells during the exponential phase of growth indicates that kinetics of bacterial growth are fastest for cells grown in media adjusted to pH 7 compared to media adjusted to other investigated pH conditions ( Figure 5 . 2C ) . This is also reflected by the lower generation time needed to double the number of bacterial cells when they were cultured in media with pH 7 compared to media with higher or lower pH conditions ( Figure 5 . 2D ) . As can be seen from Figures 5 . 2C and 5 . 2D , a transition in the generation time and in the specific growth rate constant was observed for cells cultured in media adjusted to pH 7 . Interestingly , pH 7 is considered in the literature as the optimal pH condition for growth 63 , 64 and motility 65 of Listeria species as well as for production of Listeria virulence factors such as heamolysin 63 and 222 listeriolysin O 18 . Our results demonstrated that L . monocytogenes has a pH - dependent acid tolerance response system .

Although rarely reported in the literature 27 , 28 , the use of the work of adhesion as a measure of bacterial interactions is unique for the following two reasons . First , the criterion used to compute bacterial work of adhesion is well defined and thus work of adhesion values computed for 223 various microbes can be compared . Second , the work of adhesion computed is independent of the shape of the adhesion force peaks or the user choice of the resolution of adhesion forces . The distribution of the work of adhesion values quantified between the AFM silicon nitride cantilevers and the bacterial surface biopolymers of pathogenic L . monocytogenes ATCC 51776 grown at five different pH values are shown in Figures 5 . 3A - 3E . The distribution of the work of adhesion mainly reflects the heterogeneity of the bacterial surface biopolymers 66 . With no exception , AFM studies on bacterial adhesion to surfaces always demonstrate large heterogeneity as evident from large standard deviations in the mean of the reported adhesion data 66 . Since bacterial surfaces are known to comprise many types and chemical functionalities of biopolymers 66 , it is not surprising that a range of work of adhesion values for the silicon nitride tip were observed for the L . monocytogenes cells under all conditions investigated . To describe the heterogeneity in the distribution of the work of adhesion values , the log - normal dynamic peak function with four fitting parameters was used to fit the data in Figures 5 . 3A through 5 . 3E . The quality of the fits was judged by the coefficient of correlation ( r 2 ) values which were always higher than 0 . 975 ± 0 . 030 for all pH conditions tested . According to Figure 5 . 3 , the log - normal model predicted a transition in the most probable work of adhesion value at pH 7 ( 0 . 21 fJ ) compared to 0 . 14 ± 0 . 03 fJ for higher or lower pH conditions . The log - normal function as well predicted a wider distribution of data for work of adhesion values measured for cells cultured in media with pH 7 . Previously , we have shown that a more heterogeneous data is generally associated with a more - complicated bacterial surface composition 45 and a higher grafting density of bacterial surface biopolymers 46 . This is consistent with a study in the literature that indicated that the composition of surface proteins of clinical and environmental L . monocytogenes strains was acid - regulated and significantly decreased as the cultures were grown 224 at pH 5 compared to pH 7 19 . The same study indicated that the macroscale adhesion of the various L . monocytogenes strains investigated to polystyrene plates decreased as the pH of growth was changed from 7 to 5 19 . The heterogeneities reported in the work of adhesion values quantified on single L . monocytogenes cells are consistent with heterogeneities reported in the cell lag - phase and generation times among individual L . monocytogenes cells cultured under fixed environmental conditions ( pH 4 . 4 - 7 . 4 ) 62 . Growth data collected using optical density measurements at 600 nm for single L . monocytogenes cells placed in a 96 - well micro - titer plate and grown at six different pH levels ( 7 . 4 , 6 . 0 , 5 . 5 , 5 . 0 , 4 . 7 and 4 . 4 ) indicated that heterogeneities in the lag - phase were best described using a Weibull distribution while heterogeneities in the generation times were best described using a normal distribution 62 .

The probabilities of occurrences of the work of adhesion values were normalized by the total number of work of adhesion events measured for each investigated pH condition . Solid lines indicate the log - normal dynamic peak function with four parameters fits to the data . According to the log - normal function , the probability of observing a certain work of adhesion value is given by : ) 2 ) / ln ( exp ( ) ( 2 2 d c W b a W P − + = where a is the intercept of the log - normal fit to the data , b is the amplitude of the histogram , c is the most probable work of adhesion value and d refers to the width of the distribution . The values of a , b , c , d and r 2 for pH 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 are given sequentially as ( a : 4 . 005 , 3 . 082 , 3 . 113 , 3 . 501 and 3 . 72 ) , ( b : 0 . 51 , 0 . 63 , 0 . 48 , 0 . 61 and 0 . 48 ) , ( c ( fJ ) : 0 . 13 , 0 . 13 , 0 . 21 , 0 . 18 and 0 . 11 ) , ( d : - 0 . 14 , 0 . 04 , 1 . 32 , 0 . 32 and 0 . 44 ) and ( r 2 : 0 . 985 , 0 . 995 , 0 . 923 , 0 . 979 and 0 . 992 ) . In addition to the distribution of the work of adhesion values investigated in Figure 5 . 3A - 3E , the overall work of adhesion of silicon nitride to L . monocytogenes cells grown at 226 various pH values was determined by quantifying the mean , median , mode , standard deviation and range for all the adhesion data collected under a specific pH value ( Table 5 . 2 ) . Pair - wise statistical tests were used to determine whether pH of the growth media played a significant role on the work of adhesion values measured between the biopolymers of L . monocytogenes and silicon nitride in water . All 10 combinations of pairs were tested . The differences in the median values among the work of adhesion values measured on L . monocytogenes tested were significantly greater than would be expected by chance except for three cases ( Dunn rank sum tests , p < 0 . 001 ) . The work of adhesion values measured on cells grown at pH 5 were not significantly different from those grown at pH 6 and pH 9 as well as the work of adhesion values measured on cells grown at pH 6 were not significantly different from those grown at pH 9 ( Dunn rank sum tests , p > 0 . 05 ) .

Irrespective of the statistical measure that was used to describe the distribution of the work of adhesion values quantified between L . monocytogenes surface biopolymers grown at various pH growth conditions and 227 silicon nitride in water , the work of adhesion was at its maximum for cells grown in BHIB adjusted to a pH of 7 . 0 and at its minimum for cells grown in media adjusted to either the extreme alkali ( pH 9 ) or the extreme acidic ( pH 5 ) conditions investigated ( Figure 5 . 4A , Table 5 . 3 ) . The decreased adhesion observed at pH 5 and 9 is most likely due to a decrease in the surface concentration of biopolymers , especially proteins . Proteomics studies on pathogenic L . monocytogenes EGDe strain indicated that up to 65 % and 67 % of 693 proteins were repressed upon culturing the microbe at pH 4 and pH 10 compared to culturing the microbe at pH 7 ( control ) 15 . Modified surface compositions of bacterial proteins might lead to altered adhesion between the microbe and inert surfaces 19 . In another study , growing L . monocytogenes strains ( EDG - e , X - Li - mo , 500 and 111 ) in pH 5 resulted in down - regulation in the expression of flagellin compared to the same strains grown in pH 7 ( control ) . The lower concentration of flagellin proteins for cells grown in pH 5 resulted in a lower cell adhesion to polystyrene compared to cells grown in pH 7 and with a higher concentration of flagellin proteins 19 . Another study also showed that the number of L . monocytogenes ScottA cells attached to N - Buna rubber and stainless steel decreased after cultivation at pH 5 . 5 compared to cells cultured at pH 7 probably due to a reduction in the surface concentration of proteins 67 . 228 pH 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 W o r k o f A dhe s i on ( f J ) 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 AFM HM Model A ) W adh ( AFM ) ( fJ ) 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 W a dh ( CA ) ( f J ) 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 B ) Figure 5 . 4 .

Note that ps ds s γ γ γ + = . 5 . 3 . 4 Contact Angles of L . monocytogenes Lawns of Cells as a Function of the pH Conditions of Growth . The physiochemical surface properties of the surface of L . monocytogenes as a function of the pH of the growth media were determined by contact angle measurements 30 - 32 , 69 . To determine the thermodynamic properties of the L . monocytogenes surfaces , diiodomethane and water were chosen as the apolar and polar liquids , respectively ( Table 5 . 1 ) 70 . The average contact angle values on L . monocytogenes tested ranged from 34 . 4 o to 43 . 2 o for water and from 63 . 2 o to 66 . 5 o for diiodomethane . Water contact angles can be used as a qualitative indication of the cell surface hydrophobicity . According to Vogler 71 , hydrophobic surfaces exhibit water contact angles higher than 65 o , while lower values of contact angles indicate that the surfaces are hydrophilic . In this study , the obtained contact angles of water indicated that all L . monocytogenes were hydrophilic irrespective of the pH of the growth media . According to Table 5 . 1 , L . monocytogenes was found to be mostly hydrophilic when cultured at pH 7 and mostly hydrophobic when cultured at pH 8 . Silicon nitride is also hydrophilic ( Table 5 . 1 ) . Therefore , since silicon nitride is hydrophilic , adhesion is expected to be highest when the cells are mostly hydrophilic . Therefore , at pH 7 , the work of adhesion was at its highest due to a combination of a possible increase in the bacterial surface concentration of biopolymers and to 230 an increased hydrophilicity of the bacterial surface . Although the contact angle values of L . monocytogenes were rarely reported in literature , the water contact angle values measured in this study are similar to those previously reported 72 , 73 . For example , water contact angles for L . monocytogenes Bof415 and LO28 were reported as 37 . 5 o and 35 . 8 o when grown until their late - exponential phase of growth in BHIB at 20 o C 72 . In another study , the water contact angles for L . monocytogenes 994 were 37 . 8 ± 2 . 1 o when grown overnight in Tryptic soy broth ( TSB ) at 25 o C 73 . Although the authors did not mention the pH values of their growth media , the fresh BHIB and TSB growth media will have pH values of 7 . 4 ± 0 . 2 and pH 7 . 3 ± 0 . 2 , successively according to the manufactures . It should be noted here that the contact angle values are largely dependent on bacterial species 72 , 74 , strains 73 , growth phase 72 , growth temperature 72 , preparation of bacterial lawns 75 and on the liquids used to measure the contact angles 37 , 74 , 75 . Therefore , extreme caution should be taken when comparing the contact angles measured by different research groups in the literature . 5 . 3 . 5 Quantification of the Surface Tension Components of L . monocytogenes Lawns of Cells and Silicon Nitride . The surface tension components of L . monocytogenes lawns of cells grown at different pH conditions and the silicon nitride substrate were calculated according to the HM model ( equation 5 . 3 ) ( Table 5 . 3 ) . In addition , the polarity of the cell ( χ ) expressed as s p γ γ χ = was calculated for all pH conditions tested and for the probing liquids used ( Table 5 . 3 ) . Our results indicated that L . monocytogenes cells grown at different pH conditions of growth varied slightly in their polarity with the polarity being the least for cells grown in media adjusted to pH 7 . Because the dispersive ( d s γ ) and polar ( p s γ ) surface tension components are 231 sensitive to the surface chemistry of the cell , variations observed in polarities are most likely the result of changes in the bacterial surface composition of biopolymers as they get cultured in various pH conditions 52 . They may also reflect the change in the composition of the apparent surface functional groups on the bacterial surface biopolymers 76 due to expected variations in the conformation of bacterial surface molecules as the pH of the environment changes 77 . According to the studies of Wu 61 , the work of adhesion will be favored between surfaces of equal polarity values 61 . In the current study , the polarity of silicon nitride ( χ = 0 . 42 ) was closest to the polarity of cells grown in media adjusted to a pH value of 7 ( χ = 0 . 58 ) . Therefore , the adhesion of L . monocytogenes to silicon nitride is expected to be more favorable for cells grown in media with pH 7 compared to cells grown in media adjusted to other pH values 78 . 5 . 3 . 6 The Role of the pH of Growth Media on the Femto - Joule Work of Adhesion Values Quantified for Lawns of L . monocytogenes Cells . To calculate the work of adhesion governing the macroscale interactions between lawns of L . monocytogenes cells and silicon nitride , the surface tension components of bacteria and silicon nitride ( Table 5 . 3 ) were used to calculate the surface free energies between bacteria - water , bacteria - silicon nitride and silicon nitride - water ( equations 5 . 8 , 5 . 9 and 5 . 10 ) 61 . The computed surface free energies were then used to estimate the work of adhesion per unit area required to bind lawns of L . monocytogenes cells to a silicon nitride surface while immersed in water ( equations 5 . 4 and 5 . 7 ) . The work of adhesion values per unit area were converted to femto - Joule work of adhesion by multiplying these values by the area ( A ) of contact between the bacterial cells and silicon nitride taken as 4 . 02 x 10 - 14 m 2 ( equations 5 . 5 and 5 . 6 ) . 232 Table 5 . 4 : A summary of the work of adhesion values quantified between silicon nitride and bacterial cells grown under various pH conditions both using AFM and the HM model ( equations 5 . 2 and 5 . 7 , respectively ) . The dispersion and polar components of the work of adhesion measured using contact angles between L . monocytogenes cells grown at various pH values and silicon nitride in water are also given . pH 5 pH 6 pH 7 pH 8 pH 9 AFM , adh W ( fJ ) ( equations 5 . 1 and 5 . 2 ) 0 . 117 0 . 129 0 . 265 0 . 175 0 . 108 HM W dadh ( fJ ) ( equation 5 . 4 , 5 . 7 , 5 . 8 and 5 . 10 ) 0 . 044 0 . 046 0 . 022 0 . 031 0 . 022 HM W padh ( fJ ) ( equation 5 . 4 , 5 . 7 , 5 . 9 and 5 . 10 ) 0 . 361 0 . 394 0 . 549 0 . 487 0 . 375 HM W adh ( fJ ) ( equation 5 . 4 , 5 . 7 , 5 . 8 , 5 . 9 and 5 . 10 ) 0 . 405 0 . 441 0 . 571 0 . 518 0 . 397 HM W G adh − = ∆ ( fJ ) ( equations 5 . 4 and 5 . 7 ) - 0 . 405 - 0 . 441 - 0 . 571 - 0 . 518 - 0 . 397 For all investigated pH conditions , the HM model predicted positive values for the work of adhesion indicating that adhesion between bacteria and silicon nitride in water is a thermodynamically favorable process ( Table 5 . 4 ) . The strongest work of adhesion was found for L . monocytogenes cells grown in a media with pH 7 ( adh W = 0 . 571 fJ ) , while the weakest work of adhesion was found at pH 9 condition of growth ( adh W = 0 . 397 fJ ) , relatively close to the work of adhesion at pH 5 condition of growth ( adh W = 0 . 405 fJ ) ( Figure 5 . 4A , Table 5 . 4 ) . According to thermodynamics , adhesion of L . monocytogenes should be energetically more favorable as the surface free energies of solid surfaces decrease 78 . This indicates that the macroscale attachments between L . monocytogenes lawns of cells and silicon nitride in water are more favorable when the cells were grown under pH 7 compared to other higher or lower pH values ( Table 5 . 4 ) . Our findings are consistent with a prior study which indicated that the number of attached cells of L . monocytogenes decreased as the solid surface free energy of the cells 233 increased in water 74 . Furthermore , the contribution of dispersive and polar components to the work of adhesion was calculated using equation 5 . 4 , 5 . 7 , 5 . 8 , 5 . 9 and 5 . 10 . For all tested pH conditions of growth , both calculated dispersive work of adhesion ( dadh W ) and the polar work of adhesion ( padh W ) were positive . The dadh W values ranged from 0 . 022 fJ to 0 . 046 fJ and the padh W values ranged from 0 . 361 fJ to 0 . 549 fJ ( Table 5 . 4 ) . The relatively weak dispersive work of adhesion quantified between L . monocytogenes and silicon nitride in water indicated that the polar ( short - range ) interactions became more important than dispersive interactions after physical contact between the cantilever and the bacterial surface has occurred 56 . 5 . 3 . 7 Comparison of the Work of Adhesion Values Computed between Silicon Nitride and Individual or Lawns of L . monocytogenes Cells . The work of adhesion values quantified between the surface biopolymers of individual or lawns of L . monocytogenes cells grown under various pH conditions and silicon nitride in water were compared using AFM and contact angle measurements , respectively ( Tables 5 . 2 and 4 , Figure 5 . 4B ) . When compared , both approaches predicted the highest work of adhesion for cells cultured in a media adjusted to pH 7 ( Figure 5 . 4A ) . Note that according to the second law of thermodynamics , any system thrives to minimize its free energy . Thus at pH 7 , conditions of growth provide the conditions needed to drive L . monocytogenes to highest stability as the Gibbs free energy values were at their minimum ( Table 5 . 4 ) . As can be seen from Figure 5 . 4B , a linear correlation exists between the two types of work of adhesion ( 288 . 0 ) ( 121 . 1 ) ( + × = fJ AFM W fJ HM W adh adh , r 2 = 0 . 923 ) . As can be seen from the relationship above , the macroscale approach predicted larger work of adhesion values in comparison to the AFM approach . In addition , an offset was observed between the two approaches’ estimates of the work of adhesion . The offset error might be caused by inaccuracies associated with contact angle measurements . For example , the contact angles are affected by the 234 structure 79 , thickness 80 and moist content 75 of bacterial lawn and the presence of macroscopic gas pockets 81 . In comparison , AFM excludes such effects prior to direct force measurements between the AFM tip and single bacterial cell molecules as both surfaces are fully immersed in the liquid . 5 . 4 Conclusions The femtoscale adhesion energies which govern the interactions between individual or lawns of pathogenic L . monocytogenes grown at various pH conditions ( pH 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 ) and a model surface of silicon nitride in water were quantified using AFM and contact angle measurements , respectively . Our results indicated that the strongest and the weakest femto - Joule work of adhesion were reported between silicon nitride and L . monocytogenes cells grown in media adjusted to pH 7 and pH 5 or pH 9 , respectively . The highest work of adhesion observed at pH 7 can be attributed to an increase in the bacterial surface concentration of biopolymers and to an increase in the hydrophilicity of the bacterial cells . Our contact angle measurements and thermodynamic analysis indicated that the surfaces of L . monocytogenes cells grown in pH 7 were the most polar . The transition in the magnitudes of the work of adhesion at pH 7 was associated with a better survival rate of L . monocytogenes cells at pH 7 conditions of growth compared to other pH conditions investigated . Although our study indicates that L . monocytogenes cells are characterized by acid - responsive systems , the cells survival and adhesion were at their highest when cultured in pH 7 while their adhesion at other condition was significantly reduced . This adds to the known pH 7 interesting effects on L . monocytogenes functions including being considered as the optimal pH condition for growth 63 , 64 , motility 65 and production of Listeria virulence factors such as heamolysin 63 and listeriolysin O 18 . Our results thus indicate that biofilm formation and inert surface contamination will be delayed if samples 235 were stored in low or high acidic conditions 19 . Finally , the femto - Joule work of adhesion of L . monocytogenes calculated using AFM on individual cells and thermodynamics on lawns of cells were linearly correlated . This is very important as it indicates that AFM measurements of the work of adhesion can be possibly used to predict the adhesion behavior and strength of lawns of bacterial cells under controlled aqueous environments . 5 . 5 Acknowledgments We would like to thank Prof .

Our studies combined were focused on investigating the potency of biophysical bacterial properties to be used as distinguishing factors between virulent and avirulent bacteria . In the first study ( Chapter 2 ) , the relationship between L . monocytogenes in vitro adhesion to a model inert surface and their in vivo virulence was investigated . Our results indicated that the relationship between the nanoscale adhesion forces quantified between eight L . monocytogenes strains and silicon nitride in water and the strains’ in vivo virulence were best described by a logarithmic function . Such relationship can be used as a design criterion to develop better tools that can be used in distinguishing virulent and avirulent L . monocytogenes cells . In the second study ( Chapter 3 ) , we were interested in further exploring of whether the relationship observed between bacterial adhesion to inert surfaces and bacterial virulence in Chapter two can be extended to strains that belong to more than one species . We were as well interested in quantifying the effects of heterogeneities in adhesion measurements on our predictions of useful relationships . Our results indicated that virulent Listeria strains that belonged to different species were characterized by significantly larger adhesion energies compared to avirulent Listeria species . This was consistent with our findings from Chapter two using strains that belonged to L . monocytogenes only . We also found that the heterogeneities in the femto - Joule adhesion energies quantified between bacterial strains and silicon nitride in water increased as the magnitudes of adhesion energies increased and as the virulence of the 247 bacterial strains investigated increased . This observation was mainly attributed to the fact that virulent strains are characterized by biopolymer brushes that are more heterogeneous , denser and display a wide array of biopolymers compared to avirulent strains . In the third study ( Chapter 4 ) , the relationship between the nano - mechanical properties of bacterial cell and surface biopolymers and bacterial virulence was investigated for L . monocytogenes virulent and avirulent strains . Our results indicated that the virulent strains were characterized by more flexible biopolymers , longer and denser biopolymer brushes and more rigid bacterial cells compared to the avirulent strains . Collectively , our results indicated that the conformational properties and charge of the bacterial surface biopolymers play an important role in controlling the overall bacterial cell elasticity . Our last study ( Chapter five ) investigated in details the means by which a pathogenic L . monocytogenes strain survives under chemical stress . We as well investigated the relationship between the bacterial adhesion energies quantified for individual L . monocytogenes cells and the adhesion energies quantified for lawns of L . monocytogenes cells . Our results indicated that L . monocytogenes cells adapt well to chemical stress . The cells were able to grow in all pH conditions investigated ( pH 5 to pH 9 ) . The cells were able as well to attach firmly to a model inert surface of silicon nitride irrespective of their pH condition of growth . Our results indicate that the strongest femto - Joule scale adhesion energies of L . monocytogenes were found for L . monocytogenes cells grown in a media with pH 7 and the weakest adhesion energies were found at acidic ( pH 5 ) and alkali ( pH 9 ) conditions of growth . At the macroscale , the pathogen adapted well to chemical stress as well . Contact angle measurements on lawns of L . monocytogenes cells indicated that the bacterial surface was always hydrophilic irrespective of the pH conditions of growth . Theoretical thermodynamic calculations predicated that the microbe will adhere well to 248 silicon nitride under all pH conditions with the strongest adhesion energies calculated for microbes grown in media adjusted to a pH 7 . Finally , the femto - Joule scale interaction energies of L . monocytogenes calculated from AFM measurement scaled linearly with macroscale surface adhesion energies estimated using the thermodynamic - based approach . Our results thus indicate that AFM measurements on individual cells can be valid predictors of the behavior of lawns of bacterial cells . In summary , our results combined have pointed to major differences in the biophysical properties of virulent and avirulent bacterial cells and species . We have shown that virulent cells are characterized by longer , denser and more charged biopolymer brushes compared to avirulent cells . Such brushes facilitate the interactions between bacterial cells and other inert surfaces leading to higher adhesion magnitudes . The biopolymer brush characteristics described above lead to more heterogeneous measurements as well . The stronger adhesion observed for the higher virulence strains might be a way for virulent strains to survive better in the environment and thus increase their likelihood of being virulent to animals and humans . The AFM studies shown here are a step forward towards better fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that control Listeria adhesion , virulence and survival in the environment . The approaches developed in this thesis are applicable to other AFM studies of microbes , viruses and mammalian cells as well . Finally , molecular approach taken in investigating the relationship between L . monocytogenes adhesion and virulence is a new research methodology that was proven to have a high resolution in quantifying nanoscale attachment differences among various virulent and avirulent strains tested and thus can lead to a better fundamental understanding of the bacterial adhesion and virulence relationships . 249 6 . 2 Recommendations for Further Studies During the course of my study , several uncovered issues needed to be addressed in more details . The purpose of this part of Chapter 6 is therefore to identify and discuss the need for further research . A brief discussion of these issues is presented below with some interesting preliminary results . 6 . 2 . 1 . Decoupling of Bacterial Adhesion Forces into Specific and Non - Specific Forces . The initial adhesion of a microbe to a surface is suggested to be controlled by long range ( van der Waals and electrostatic ) interactions 1 , which could be modeled by the Derjaguin - Landau - Verwey - Overbeek ( DLVO ) theory 2 . However the DLVO predicted values are many orders of magnitude smaller than those predicted from AFM force data . The discrepancies are due to the fact that the adhesive forces measured between bacteria and surfaces include the combined effects of van der Waals and electrostatic forces , hydrogen bonding , steric interactions , and perhaps ligand - receptor type bonds 3 - 7 . While it can be difficult to relate the measured forces to their individual components , application of a Poisson statistical analysis on AFM pull - off data can allow for an accurate estimation of the non - specific ( long - range colloidal ) and specific ( chemical or short - range forces such as hydrogen bonding ) forces between the bacterial surface biopolymers and bare or functionalized AFM tips 3 , 8 , 9 . According to the Poisson model , the mean ( F µ ) and the variance ( 2 F σ ) of all the adhesion forces measured between bacterial surface biopolymers and a model surface are correlated according to : 0 2 F F F i i F F − = µ σ ( 6 . 1 ) 250 In equation 6 . 1 , i F and o F are the specific and non - specific components of the adhesion force . A linear regression of the line that passes through data points in a plot of 2 F σ versus F µ for all cells investigated can be used to compute the values of the specific and non - specific forces . In one of my preliminary studies , nanoscale interactions measured using AFM between L . monocytogenes cells grown in media with pH 7 and a model surface of silicon nitride in water were decoupled into specific and non - specific components using the Poisson statistical model approach described above 3 , 8 , 9 . Briefly , a linear regression through the scatter plot that relates the mean and the variance of the adhesion forces was used to determine the specific and non - specific components of the overall adhesion force ( Figure 6 . 1 ) . As can be seen from Figure 6 . 1 , the specific forces ( 0 . 226 nN ) and nonspecific forces ( 0 . 236 nN ) governing the adhesion of L . monocytogenes to silicon nitride ( F µ = 0 . 527 nN ) were of very similar magnitudes . The estaimted non - specific adhesion forces from the Poisson model were compared to theoretical predictions of these forces using soft - particle DLVO colloidal theory 5 , 10 . The net non - specific adhesion force was calculated to be 0 . 236 nN as the sum of van der Waals ( 0 . 061 nN ) and electrostatic forces ( 0 . 175 nN ) between bacterial and silicon nitride at the closest distance of approach taken as 0 . 3 nm 3 . Our preliminary findings indicate that the Poisson model estimates of the non - specific forces agree well with soft - particle DLVO theory predictions of the same forces . Next , specific and non - specific forces will be calculated using soft - particle DLVO and results will be compared to Poisson model estimates of these forces for L . monocytogenes cells grown in various pH values as well as for all virulent and avirulent Listeria species to see if both types of species vary in the type of forces that dominate their interactions to model inert surfaces . 251 Figure 6 . 1 . A scatter plot that shows the relationship between the mean and the variance of adhesion forces quantified between L . monocytogenes cells grown in media adjusted to a pH value of 7 and silicon nitride in water . The error bars represent the standard error of mean . The solid line represents the linear regression fit to the data that was used to calculate the specific and non - specific components of the adhesion , with resulting parameters being , the specific force , F i = 0 . 226 nN , the intercept ( - F i F o ) = - 0 . 053 nN 2 , and the non - specific force ( F o ) = 0 . 236 nN . r 2 for the application of the Poisson distribution to this data was 0 . 92 . 6 . 2 . 2 Contribution of Flagella to the Overall Bacterial Adhesion to Inert Surfaces . Generally , there are three main ways by which bacterial flagella can contribute to bacterial pathogenesis . The flagella can serve as adhesins to tether bacteria to host cells much like fimbrial adhesins . For example , the flagella of entero - pathogenic E . coli contribute to the microbe adhesion to epithelial cells in a manner that is independent of motility 11 . The flagella can also serve as a motility device targeting bacteria to specific areas of the gastrointestinal tract as demonstrated for Helicobacter pylori . Colonization of the stomach by H . pylori is dependent 252 on the spatial orientation of motile bacteria within the pH gradient of the gastric mucus 12 . Finally , the flagellum can serve as a secretion apparatus for virulence factors , similar to a type III secretion system . For example , Yersinia enterolitica secrets a virulence - associated phospholipase A and YlpA through the flagellar apparatus 13 . While the above studies have proposed a various ways of flagellar contributions to bacterial pathogenesis , very little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which L . monocytogenes flagella play a role in controlling bacterial adhesion to inert surfaces , the first step in the route of pathogens to infections . L . monocytogenes produces four to six peritrichous flagella per cell , of which a filament consists of thousands of one major subunit , flaA - encoded flagellin monomers ( 30 . 44 kDa ) 14 , 15 . The flagellin is produced and assembled at the cell surface when L . monocytogenes grows between 4 o C and 30 o C , while its production is markedly reduced at 37 o C . Therefore , L . monocytogenes strains are generally not motile in vivo at physiological temperature , 37 o C . However it was reported that the flagella contribute to L . monocytogenes adhesion and invasion of human intestinal epithelial Caco - 2 cells at 37 o C after the cells were grown at 30 o C 14 . In addition 20 strains among 100 human clinical isolates of L . monocytogenes appeared to be still motile at 37 o C 14 . In another study in literature , the analysis of L . monocytogenes surface proteins indicated that the flagellin could be involved in the adhesion process 15 . In another study , a flagellin down - regulated L . monocytogenes strain could not adhere to a polystyrene surface , whereas the wild type strain did adhere onto the surface 15 . These results suggest that the flagellum is used as an adhesion molecule . On the contrary , other reports in the literature indicate that the flagella proteins do not function as adhesins to enhance the adhesion of L . monocytogenes to targeted host cells while motility is important for tissue culture invasion 16 , 17 . For example , the flagellated but non - motile L . monocytogenes strain did not adhere to or 253 invade human epithelial cells more efficiently than the non - flagellated strain 17 . Another example is given by Lemon et al . 16 , compared to wild - type L . monocytogenes , flagellum - minus and paralyzed - flagellum mutants were defective in biofilm development . Motivated by the limited knowledge in the literature on the exact role of flagella in contributing to bacterial adhesion of bacteria to inert surfaces , I planed to evaluate at a molecular level , the role of flagella contributing to bacterial adhesion to surfaces . In one of my preliminary studies , interactions between L . ivanovii 13287 flagella and a model surface of silicon nitride were measured using AFM ( Figure 6 . 2 A and B ) in water . As can be seen from Figure 6 . 2 . B , the force curve has a regular saw - tooth pattern ( characteristic fingerprint of proteins ) that reflects the sequential unfolding of individual protein domains by AFM 18 . More measurements need to be performed and analyzed to improve our understating of the mechanisms by which the flagella contribute to cell adhesion and invasion . The magnitude of the adhesion of the flagella to silicon nitride will be compared to the overall adhesion of the microbe to the silicon nitride surface to check if the flagella contribution is significant . Further , comparison between the nanoscale adhesion of flagella to silicon nitride to the macroscale role of flagella in bacterial attachment and biofilms formation will improve our understanding of the role of flagella in controlling bacterial adhesion to inert surfaces . 254 Distance ( µ m ) 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 Fo r ce ( n N ) - 0 . 3 - 0 . 2 - 0 . 1 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 Approach Retraction ( B ) Figure 6 . 2 ( A ) A tapping mode image of L . ivanovii 13287 flagella taken in water .

Research over the years was focused on understanding the role of proteins in the in vivo mechanisms of attachment of L . monocytogenes to host cells , invasion of host cells and spread of microbes from the host cells to cause infections 19 - 23 . Although the mechanisms by which surface proteins of L . monocytogenes usually attack mammalian cells are important , the mechanisms by which proteins and carbohydrates of L . monocytogenes help them to successfully attach to inert surfaces are equally important in controlling L . monocytogenes infections and disease outbreaks . Therefore I focused this study on understanding the particular role of surface proteins and carbohydrates on the adhesion of L . monocytogenes to inert surfaces . In a preliminary work , the interaction forces between L . monocytogenes and a model surface of silicon nitride were measured via atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) in water . Three various compositions of L . monocytogenes surface biopolymer were investigated . The first one was the native surface of L . monocytogenes . The second one was L . monocytogenes cells after partial removal of their surface proteins and carbohydrates via ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) treatment . The third surface composition was that of L . monocytogenes cells of which only surface proteins were selectively removed via Trypsin treatment . Colorimetric assays were used to measure the concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates for the wild - type cells and for cells after EDTA and trypsin treatments . The EDTA treatment removed 48 % of proteins and 29 % of carbohydrates from L . monocytogenes surfaces while the trypsin treatment removed 99 % of proteins and 9 % of the carbohydrates . The composition of proteins and carbohydrates of L . monocytogenes were reported using a normalized ratio of proteins to carbohydrates ( P / C ) . Our preliminary results indicated that the adhesion forces ( F ad ) are positively correlated with the P / C ratio on the bacterial surface ( F ad ( nN ) = 0 . 019 × P / C + 0 . 159 , r 2 = 0 . 95 ) ( Figure 6 . 3 ) . Our results 256 indicated that the bacterial surface proteins contributed more to the total adhesion of L . monocytogenes to silicon nitride compared to the surface carbohydrates .
