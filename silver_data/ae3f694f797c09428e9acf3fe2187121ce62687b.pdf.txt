Carver Charitable Trust The tubular endolysosomal network is a quality control system that ensures the proper delivery of internalized receptors to specific subcellular destinations in order to maintain cellular homeo - stasis . Although retromer was originally described in yeast as a regulator of endosome - to - Golgi receptor recycling , mammalian retromer has emerged as a central player in endosome - to - plasma membrane recycling of a variety of receptors . Over the past decade , information regarding the mechanism by which retromer facilitates receptor trafficking has emerged , as has the identifica - tion of numerous retromer - associated molecules including the WASH complex , sorting nexins ( SNXs ) and TBC1d5 . Moreover , the recent demonstration that several SNXs can directly interact with retromer cargo to facilitate endosome - to - Golgi retrieval has provided new insight into how these receptors are trafficked in cells . The mechanism by which SNX17 cargoes are recycled out of the endosomal system was demonstrated to involve a retromer - like complex termed the retriever , which is recruited to WASH positive endosomes through an interaction with the COMMD / CCDC22 / CCDC93 ( CCC ) complex . Lastly , the mechanisms by which bacterial and viral pathogens highjack this complex sorting machinery in order to escape the endolysosomal system or remain hidden within the cells are beginning to emerge . In this review , we will high - light recent studies that have begun to unravel the intricacies by which the retromer and associ - ated molecules contribute to receptor trafficking and how deregulation at this sorting domain can contribute to disease or facilitate pathogen infection .

Receptor endocytosis and subse - quent sorting in endosomes are major pathways to preserve cellular homeostasis . Integral membrane proteins and their associated macro - molecules are internalized via endocytosis . They can be further deliv - ered to lysosomes for degradation , or targeted to the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) or the plasma membrane for reuse ( Figure 1 ) . These processes , known as endosomal protein sorting , are essential for a wide array of physiological functions , including nutrient uptake , devel - opmental and neural signaling , as such , genetic defects in these pro - cesses have been linked with pathologies such as neurological disorders and diabetes 1 , 4 , 5 . One of the best - characterized protein complexes regulating endo - somal sorting is the evolutionarily conserved retromer complex , which was first identified in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2 decades ago 6 . Retromer is a coat complex that assembles on endosomes , and mediates the transport of receptors that traverse the endosomal com - partment on their way to an ultimate physiologic destination such as the plasma membrane or the TGN , and are thus referred to as “ cargo ” proteins . The core of retromer is the VPS35 - VPS26 - VPS29 heterotri - mer , which is conserved from yeast to human ( Table 1 ) . Since the core complex is able to recognize certain cargo , it was termed the cargo - selective complex ( CSC ) . Retromer functions together with a large number of accessory proteins to package cargo into tubular or vesicu - lar structures for transport to the TGN or plasma membrane . Although the role of retromer in endosomal sorting is well estab - lished , recent work has identified additional retromer - dependent and retromer - independent trafficking pathways , and revealed their func - tions in development and human disease ( Figure 1 ) . Several novel reg - ulators , including TBC1d5 , TBC1d23 , the WASH actin regulatory complex , and the recently described COMMD / CCDC22 / CCDC93 ( CCC ) and retriever complexes have been identified and characterized ( Table 1 ) . Accumulating evidence suggests that sorting nexin ( SNX ) proteins , in addition to binding to membranes play a critical role in cargo selection . In this review , we focus on these newly identified endosomal sorting machineries , and summarize the current under - standing of their roles in endosomal trafficking and retrograde vesicu - lar transport . We also discuss how viral and bacterial pathogens exploit endosomal trafficking pathways to promote their replication during infection . We do not intend to discuss every aspect of endoso - mal sorting due to space limitations , and interested readers are referred to excellent reviews published elsewhere 1 , 4 , 5 , 7 . 2 | TBC1D5 REGULATION OF RECEPTOR TRAFFICKING Study of classic coat proteins including the clathrin / adaptor protein , COPI and COPII ( coat protein complex I or II ) , has revealed that small GTPases are essential for the formation of coated vesicles 8 – 11 . Simi - larly , the endosomal - localized Rab7a GTPase is required for the mem - brane recruitment of the retromer CSC , and this role is conserved in yeast , plants and mammals 12 – 19 . TBC1d5 is a member of the FIGURE 1 Representative trafficking pathways of transmembrane receptors . Transmembrane proteins are internalized into early endosomes via endocytosis . Maturation of early endosomes into late endosomes leads to protein degradation via lysosome . Some proteins are delivered to the plasma membrane or to the TGN with the assistance of retromer , retriever , WASH , CCC and a variety of SNX proteins , thus escaping lysosomal degradation . At the TGN , TBC1d23 and associated proteins are responsible for receiving endosomal vesicles WANG ET AL . 579 Tre2 - Bub2 - Cdc16 ( TBC ) family , and was first identified through its association with retromer in yeast - 2 - hybrid and immunoprecipitation experiments 19 , 20 . Both human and worm TBC1d5 function as GTPase - activating proteins ( GAP ) for Rab7a , catalyzing GTP hydroly - sis and thus , inactivating Rab7a 21 , 22 . Over - expression of TBC1d5 was shown to decrease the amount of Rab7a - GTP and reduce the amount of VPS35 on endosomes 19 . Therefore , TBC1d5 was initially proposed to inhibit retromer trafficking ; recent evidence , however , suggests that TBC1d5 is more than an inhibitory factor for retromer . Among all the known endogenous regulators of retromer , TBC1d5 displays the highest affinity toward retromer 21 . TBC1d5 forms a stable complex with retromer , with a dissociation constant of 220 to 450 nM 21 , 23 . Such an affinity is comparable to that measured between VPS29 and VPS35 ( ~ 200 nM ) , and is at least one order of magnitude higher than the affinity between retromer and its other binding partners , such as SNX3 , VARP , Rab7a or the WASH complex subunit FAM21 16 , 21 , 23 – 26 . TBC1d5 harbors a TBC domain on its N - terminus , and a largely disordered C - terminus . The TBC domain medi - ates the interaction with retromer , through contacting both VPS35 and VPS29 21 . A loop from TBC1d5 binds to a conserved hydrophobic pocket on VPS29 , and a second loop may interact with the N - terminus of VPS35 . Interestingly , a VPS35 mutant unable to associate with TBC1d5 did not localize properly to endosomes , suggesting that TBC1d5 may play a role in recruiting VPS35 to endosomal membrane 14 , 21 . The tight association between TBC1d5 and retromer is akin to the Sec23 - Sec24 complex in the COPII coat . Similar to TBC1d5 , Sec23 is a GAP for the Sar1 GTPase . The interaction between Sec23 and Sar1 is needed for the recruitment of the COPII coat to ER ( endo - plasmic reticulum ) membranes , at least in an in vitro reconstitution system 10 , 11 . GTP hydrolysis of Sar1 , promoted by Sec23 , is believed to be essential for the maturation of COPII vesicles and coat disas - sembly . Past studies have provided mechanistic insights into the for - mation process of the COPII coat , and recognition of the analogy between the retromer and COPII systems may help to understand how retromer - coated vesicles are formed . Recently , Steinberg et al have revealed a novel role for both ret - romer and TBC1d5 in regulating the activation and subcellular locali - zation of Rab7a 27 . They found that Rab7a resides on multiple subcellular organelles in addition to the interface between EEA1 + sorting endosomes and LAMP1 / 2 + late endosomes / lysosomes . These include the TGN , endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial mem - branes . In the absence of either retromer or TBC1d5 , Rab7a - GTP levels substantially increase and Rab7a accumulates over the lyso - somal domains , which results in decreased Rab7a mobilization , deple - tion of inactive Rab7a from other subcellular organelles and defective membrane turnover . Intriguingly , whereas we previously showed that TBC1d5 was critical for the recycling of integrin alpha 5 and CI - MPR , Steinberg et al showed that loss of TBC1d5 did not impact the recy - cling of the retromer cargoes CI - MPR ( cationic mannose 6 phosphate receptor ) or GLUT1 . The exact reason for the discrepancy remains unclear , but could involve either the way in which the knockout cells were generated or how the trafficking assays were performed . TBC1d5 also plays a role in autophagy , a process in which cellular components are selectively targeted and degraded 27 – 30 . Studies by Dikic et al showed that TBC1d5 switches between endosomes and autophagosomes 28 , 29 . More recently , the Debnath group extended this study and showed that this switch could modulate retromer func - tion under different physiological conditions such that metabolic stress leads to the association TBC1d5 with autophagosomes , pro - moting the recycling of GLUT1 and glucose uptake 30 . 3 | SORTING NEXIN PROTEINS SNX proteins are characterized by the presence of a particular and highly conserved phox - homology ( PX ) domain and participate in vari - ety of cellular activities 31 , 32 . S . cerevisiae and human genomes encode 10 and 33 SNXs , respectively 31 . Although PX domains are capable of TABLE 1 Conservation of genes encoding endosomal protein sorting machinery in model organisms Homosapiens Musmusculus Daniorerio Drosophilamelanogaster Caenorhabditiselegans Arabidopsisthaliana Dictyostelium Saccharomycescerevisiae Retromer √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ TBC1d5 √ √ √ √ √ √ √ SNX - BAR √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ SNX3 √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ SNX27 √ √ √ √ √ SNX17 √ √ √ √ √ WASH √ √ √ √ √ a √ CCC √ √ √ √ √ b √ √ Retriever √ √ √ √ √ c √ √ TBC1d23 √ √ √ √ √ a Four homologs of WASH complex components have been reported in C . elegans ( WASH , Strumpellin , SWIP and CCDC53 ) . A possible FAM21 C . elegans homolog ( C05G5 . 2 ) , which is also conserved in other nematode species , could also be identified . However , it remains to be determined whether these proteins associate with each other to form a functional WASH complex and regulate endosomal receptor trafficking in nematodes . b C . elegans has CCC subunits : 3 homologs of CCDC93 ( C16A11 . 2 , C31E10 . 6 , C31E10 . 5 ) , no homologs of CCDC22 and one COMMD gene homolog ( T28F2 . 2 ) . It remains to be determined whether these proteins associate with each other and function in endosomal receptor trafficking . c C . elegans has a possible retriever subunit , F26G1 . 1 , which according to blast is more similar to VPS35L than to VPS35 ; interestingly , no VPS26C homolog is apparently present . 580 WANG ET AL . contacting PtdIns ( 3 ) P , recent studies reveal that certain PX domains can also interact with phosphoinositides other than PtdIns ( 3 ) P , and can also interact with a variety of proteins 31 . With endosomes being the major organelle enriched with PtdIns ( 3 ) P , the functions of SNXs have been most extensively investigated in this subcellular compartment . In addition to the PX domain , SNXs often possess other domains , including BAR ( Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ) , FERM ( protein 4 . 1 / ezrin / radixin / moesin ) and SH3 domains 31 . The presence of these additional domains allows SNX proteins to be divided into 5 subfamilies : SNX - PX , SNX - BAR , SNX - FERM , SNX - PXA - RGS - PXC and SNX - MIT 31 . Sev - eral SNXs from 3 different subfamilies have been the focus of recent studies : SNX3 of the SNX - PX subfamily , SNX1 / 2 / 5 / 6 of the SNX - BAR subfamily and SNX27 and SNX17 of the SNX - FERM subfamily ( Figure 2A ) . These SNXs associate with retromer or the recently iden - tified retriever complex , and mediate distinct endosomal trafficking pathways . Remarkably , recent studies have revealed that these SNXs play a central role in cargo recognition , in addition to binding phos - phatidylinositides ( PtdIns ) ( Figure 2B ) . SNX3 ( SNX - PX subfamily ) contains only one structural domain , the PX domain , which binds to PtdIns ( 3 ) P ( Figure 2 ) . SNX3 is required for endosome - to - TGN retrieval of Wntless in human , worm and fly 33 , 34 . In S . cerevisiae , Grd19p / SNX3 is also needed for cargo traf - ficking from endosomes to the TGN 35 . Burd et al found that retromer is recruited to the endosomal membrane through both Rab7a and SNX3 , and in vitro the recruitment depends on the presence of a transmembrane cargo , DMT1 , on the liposome 17 . More recently , a crystal structure of the quaternary VPS35 - VPS26 - SNX3 - DMT1 tail complex revealed that SNX3 binds at the interface of VPS35 and VPS26 36 . Upon binding to SNX3 , VPS26 undergoes a conformational change in its cargo - binding motif , which allows recognition of the DMT1 tail by both VPS26 and SNX3 . Thus , the SNX3 / retromer com - plex integrates 2 different activities : membrane binding and cargo recognition . Unlike SNX3 , the SNX - BAR proteins possess an additional BAR domain , which can sense membrane curvature and induce membrane tubulation 31 , 32 . The SNX - BAR proteins can target to endosomes through coincidence detection of membrane curvature and PtdIns . Members of the SNX - BAR subfamily , SNX1 or SNX2 , form a heterodi - mer with SNX5 or SNX6 in cells ( Figure 2B ) . Intriguingly , although the PX domains of SNX1 and SNX2 bind to PtdIns ( 3 ) P , the PX domain of SNX6 interacts with PtdIns ( 4 ) P 37 . Such an interaction may facilitate the dissociation of SNX - BAR - coated vesicles from motors at the TGN 37 . Interestingly , whereas a wealth of earlier studies 38 – 40 FIGURE 2 Domain organization and functional modes of select SNXs . A , Domain structures of retromer and retriever - associated SNXs . All SNXs share a conserved PX domain . SNX - BAR and SNX - FERM subfamilies possess a BAR or FERM domain , respectively , C - terminal to the PX domain . Within the SNX - FERM subfamily , SNX27 features a unique N - terminal PDZ domain whereas SNX17 has a unique C - terminal tail . B , Distinct cargo recognition modes of SNXs . Representative cargo proteins are listed under the cartoon . SNX3 interacts with both VPS35 and VPS26 subunits of retromer , and cargo recognition is achieved through cooperative action of SNX3 and VPS26 . SNX - BAR may directly bind to cargo such as CI - MPR and IGF1R . The PDZ domain of SNX27 recognizes a subset of cargo proteins independent of retromer ; however , interaction with VPS26 enhances the affinity of SNX27 for cargo . SNX17 may bridge cargo with retriever through simultaneous interaction with cargo and VPS26C WANG ET AL . 581 suggested that the retromer CSC associates with CI - MPR for its endosome - to - TGN transport , 2 recent studies indicate that SNX5 and SNX6 interact with the cytoplasmic tails of CI - MPR ( and IGF1R ) , inde - pendent of retromer ( Figure 2B ) 41 , 42 . Even more surprisingly , these studies also showed that deletion of SNX1 / 2 / 5 / 6 , but not VPS35 , leads to a pronounced defect in CI - MPR trafficking 41 , 42 . The exact reasons for these discrepancies remain unclear , but given that both SNX3 and retromer bind to DMT1 , SNX - BAR and retromer may rec - ognize the CI - MPR tail through an analogous mechanism 36 . Future studies will be necessary to address how CI - MPR and IGF1R are rec - ognized and transported . Lastly , 2 members of the SNX - FERM subfamily , SNX27 and SNX17 , have been shown to be critical for recycling of numerous cell surface proteins ( Figure 2 ) . In addition to the PX domain , both SNX27 and SNX17 contain a FERM domain , which recognizes NPxY / NxxY motifs found in a variety of proteins including growth factor receptors , solute carriers and integrins 43 . Although SNX27 contains a unique PDZ domain at its N - terminus , SNX17 does not harbor this domain , but instead possesses a unique C - terminal polypeptide sequence . Intriguingly , it is these 2 unique regions that determine the cargo selectivity of these 2 SNXs . The PDZ domain of SNX27 binds directly to VPS26 and cargo proteins with PDZ - binding motifs including glu - cose transporter GLUT1 and the β 2 - adrenergic receptor ( β 2AR ) 44 – 48 . Thus , SNX27 mediates cargo recycling through a retromer - dependent manner . In contrast , SNX17 utilizes its unique C - terminal tail to inter - act with DSCR3 ( VPS26C ) of the retriever complex ( see below ) , whereas its FERM domain binds to NPxY / NxxY motif - containing cargo proteins such as β 1 integrin 49 . As a result , SNX17 mediates the recycling of α 5 β 1 integrin in a retromer - independent , retriever - dependent manner . Collectively , through association with retromer or retriever , SNXs provide cargo specificity and help to establish diverse endosomal trafficking pathways . 4 | WASH COMPLEX The WASP family promotes actin nucleation via the Arp2 / 3 complex , to facilitate cell migration / invasion , cell - cell adhesion , endocytosis / phagocytosis , cytokinesis and intracellular membrane transport 50 , 51 . WASH1 shares the conserved VCA ( verprolin connecting and acidic ) domain ( also known as the WCA domain ) with other members of the WASP family , including WASP / N - WASP and WAVE 50 – 52 . In cells , WASH1 tightly associates with 4 other proteins , including FAM21 ( WASHC2 ) , Strumpellin ( WASHC5 ) , Strumpellin and WASH1 - interacting protein ( SWIP or WASHC4 ) and CCDC53 ( WASHC3 ) ( Figure 3A ) 53 – 55 . The WASH complex is conserved in many eukaryotic taxa , including some unicellular organisms , but is not found in the yeast S . cerevisiae ( Table 1 ) . Although some controversy exists , in general , depletion of individual subunits impacts the stability of the other subunits . For example , mouse embryonic fibroblasts lack - ing WASH show a dramatic effect on CCDC53 stability and incorpora - tion with the remaining complex members , whose levels are also diminished 56 . FAM21 is comprised of a head domain ( ~ 220 amino acids ) , which is necessary to interact with other members of the WASH complex , and an extended C - terminal tail containing 21 repeats of a novel acidic motif ( L - F - [ D / E ] 3 - 10 - L - F ) , termed the LFa motif 25 , 55 . The FAM21 tail has been suggested to function as an endosomal sig - naling hub recruiting numerous proteins , including the actin - capping protein CapZ , ANKRD50 , FKBP15 , TBC1d23 , RME - 8 and the CCC complex ( Figure 3A ) 25 , 55 , 57 – 63 . WASH1 predominantly localizes to endosomes , but can be also found associated with other organelles and even within the nucleus 64 . In the cytosol , WASH complex - mediated actin polymerization has been observed to function in several distinct endosomal recycling pathways : ( 1 ) endosome - to - Golgi retrieval of CI - MPR , 54 which also requires retromer , SNX3 and SNX - BAR proteins ; ( 2 ) endosome - to - cell surface recycling of the transferrin receptor ( TfnR ) , the β 2 - adrenoceptor ( β 2AR ) , the glucose transporter GLUT1 , the copper transporter ATP7A and α 5 β 1 integrin 53 , 56 , 60 , 65 – 67 . Interestingly , whereas recycling of TfnR , β 2AR , ATP7A and GLUT1 requires retro - mer activity , recycling of α 5 β 1 is retriever - dependent ( see below ) . ( 3 ) WASH complex is also involved in epidermal growth factor recep - tor ( EGFR ) delivery to lysosomes 68 . It should be noted that currently no evidence supports that retromer or retriever is directly required for the delivery of cargo to the degradation pathway . SNX6 appears to be needed for EGFR degradation , which may or may not be related to retromer activity 69 . ( 4 ) Finally , the WASH complex can also associate with BLOC - 1 ( biogenesis of lysosomal organelles complex - 1 ) , but the significance of this interaction remains to be determined 70 , 71 . How does the WASH complex function to promote trafficking in such diverse pathways ? Most of our understanding is derived from the better - characterized retromer - WASH pathway . In conjunction with SNX proteins , retromer mediates both endosome - to - TGN retrieval , and endosome - to - plasma membrane recycling . The WASH complex directly associates with retromer through an interaction between the LFa motif of FAM21 and VPS35 25 , 57 . Knockdown of VPS35 in cells decreases the amount of endosomal - localized WASH complex ; however , a significant amount of the WASH complex is still present on endosomes in VPS35 - KO cells , suggesting that the WASH complex can localize to endosomes in both a retromer - dependent and - independent manner 25 , 49 , 57 . Current data suggests a model by which WASH - mediated actin polymerization promotes retromer trafficking : ( 1 ) endosome - bound proteins are recognized by specific combinations of retromer and SNXs ; ( 2 ) retromer recruits the WASH complex through a direct interaction ; ( 3 ) the WASH complex is activated through ubiquitination or other yet to be characterized mechanisms , promoting actin polymerization via Arp2 / 3 complex recruitment and activation . A combination of the action of BAR domains , motor pro - teins and actin polymerization leads to the formation of tubular struc - tures ; ( 4 ) subsequently , actin polymerization , together with the activity of the dynein - dynactin complex , kinesin microtubular motor and / or Dynamin II , promotes the fission of tubular structures ; ( 5 ) ulti - mately , tubular vesicles carrying various cargo proteins are delivered to their final destinations ( Figure 3B ) . In addition to functioning in retromer - dependent receptor trafficking , the WASH complex may function in retromer - independent pathways through similar mecha - nisms ( Figure 3C ) . For instance , the SNX17 - retriever complex recog - nizes a different subset of endosomal cargo ( see below ) . These proteins associate with the WASH complex , which may help to form 582 WANG ET AL . FIGURE 3 Function of the WASH complex in retromer - and retriever - mediated trafficking . A , Organization of the WASH complex and some of its associated proteins . Whereas CCC and CapZ interact with FAM21 fragments containing amino acids 448 - 631 and 1010 - 1067 ( as indicated ) , respectively , other proteins either bind to multiple regions of FAM21 or the exact interacting regions are not fully defined . For instance , VPS35 binds to many LFa repeats of FAM21 , with highest affinity toward those at the C - terminal end of the tail . B , A model depicting the role of WASH complex in regulating retromer - mediating trafficking . Increasing concentration of cargo ( step I ) leads to membrane recruitment of the retromer - SNX27 complex ( step II ) , which , in turn , recruits the WASH complex ( step III ) . WASH - mediated actin polymerization could promote the organization of retromer endosomal subdomains ( step IV ) and formation of retromer tubules ( step V ) . WASH could also function to assist the scission of tubular structures together with other proteins , such as dynamin II ( step VI ) . C , a model depicting the role of WASH complex in regulating retriever - mediating trafficking . SNX17 binds to cargo protein on the membrane , and WASH is recruited to membrane in a retromer - dependent manner ( steps I and II ) . WASH and SNX17 in turn recruit CCC ( step III ) , and retriever complexes ( step IV ) . Similar to its role in retromer trafficking , WASH - mediated actin polymerization could promote the formation of SNX17 / cargo / CCC / retriever endosomal subdomains ( step V ) , vesicle budding ( step VI ) , and vesicle scission ( step VII ) . D , A mutation in VPS35 ( D620N ) diminishes the interaction of the WASH1 complex with the retromer , and impairs retromer - mediated cargo trafficking WANG ET AL . 583 discrete endomembrane subdomains and to facilitate vesicular scis - sion through actin polymerization . The following evidence supports the role of the WASH complex in both the formation of retromer tubules , and subsequent scission . First , in mouse embryonic fibroblasts devoid of WASH1 , a collapse of the endolysosomal network to the perinuclear region was observed 56 . There was no F - actin accumulation on the collapsed structures and only re - expression of wild - type WASH1 , but not a VCA - deleted mutant , could restore the normal architecture of the endolysosomal system , F - actin accumulation and receptor trafficking 56 . Second , in WASH1 - knockdown cells , cargo - laden tubules have been observed suggestive of a defect in actin - dependent tubule scission 54 . Third , recycling β 2AR is localized in a subset of tubular endosome microdo - mains , which do not include degrading receptors and bulk recycling proteins 66 . Recycling of β 2AR requires both SNX27 and retromer 44 , 45 . WASH , but not other WASP family members , including WASP , N - WASP and WAVE , is concentrated on β 2AR tubules 66 . Finally , a muta - tion in VPS35 ( D620N ) , that is associated with early onset Parkinson ' s Disease ( PD ) was shown to diminish the interaction of the WASH1 complex with retromer and impact vesicular trafficking from the late endosome as well as impair autophagy 72 – 77 ( Figure 3D ) . Interestingly , gain - of - function mutations in the FAM21 - associated molecule , RME - 8 , which is involved in coordinating the activity of the WASH complex with the tabulating activities of SNXs 63 , were identified in patients with PD and Lewy body pathology 78 . Thus , perturbation of receptor trafficking from the retromer subdomain seems to be a common mechanism contributing to the development of PD . Due to the importance of WASH - mediated actin polymerization in endosomal trafficking , its activity must be tightly regulated , as is the case for other WASP proteins . Indeed , although recombinant WASH1 is active toward Arp2 / 3 in vitro , the assembly of WASH1 into the pentameric complex inhibits this activity 55 . Interestingly , the WASH complex has structural similarity to the WAVE complex , which pro - motes actin polymerization at the leading edge of migrating cells 55 , 57 . Several distinct mechanisms , including small GTPase Rac , phospho - lipids and phosphorylation are known to activate the intrinsically inac - tive WAVE complex 79 . Similarly , mammalian WASH complex can be activated through TRIM27 - mediated poly - ubiquitination ( K63 linked ) on WASH1 at lysine 220 80 . Of note , this lysine residue lies within what would be the meander region of WAVE , and thus , ubiquitination at this residue might activate WASH1 by disrupting an inhibitory fold surrounding the VCA . More recently , USP7 , a deubiquitinase that interacts with TRIM27 and the MAGE - L2 cargo adaptor protein , was shown to be required to not only prevent TRIM27 from ubiquitin - mediated degradation , but also regulates WASH1 activity by control - ling the level of ubiquitination 81 . Interestingly , the gene - encoding USP7 is mutated in Autism - spectrum disorders , and the same has been noted for MAGE - L2 , suggesting that aberrant WASH1 regula - tion may be involved in the pathology of these neurological dis - eases 81 . Lastly , it should be pointed out that TRIM27 and MAGE - L2 are not ubiquitously expressed , thus the identification of signaling mechanisms contributing to the activation of WASH in cells devoid of these molecules remains to be determined . Emphasizing the importance of the WASH complex in develop - ment and human diseases is the observation that mutations in the complex lead to multiple neurological disorders . A mutation in the gene - encoding SWIP ( P1019R ) has been observed in patients with non - syndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability ( ID ) and results in diminished levels of Strumpellin and other members of the WASH complex 82 , 83 . In addition , mutations in Strumpellin have been found in patients with autosomal - dominant hereditary spastic paraple - gia ( HSP ) , but these mutations do not impact WASH complex assem - bly or endosomal localization , and thus might either be impacting WASH1 activity directly or could result from other unappreciated cel - lular functions of Strumpellin 55 , 84 , 85 . Lastly , a splice - site mutation in Strumpellin was recently observed in Ritscher - Schinzel / 3C syndrome , which among its clinical features includes ID 86 . Although other WASH complex components were not assessed , this splice - site mutation leads to an 8 - fold reduction in Strumpellin transcript and an approxxi - mately 60 % loss of Strumpellin protein . The mechanism by which WASH deregulation contributes to the pathology of ID syndromes remains to be determined , but likely involves the regulation of vesicle recycling of proteins involved in neuronal maturation , survival or func - tion during brain development . 5 | RETRIEVER COMPLEX It is of interest that WASH also regulates the recycling of SNX17 cargoes including the integrin α 5 β 1 , EGFR , LDLR and Notch ligand Jag1 87 – 92 . However , how SNX17 couples trafficking of its cargos to WASH - regulated subdomains remained a mystery until very recently 49 , 93 . Through a series of proteomic and functional studies it was uncovered that SNX17 interacts with C16orf62 , DSCR3 and VPS29 , among other proteins ( Figure 2B ) . C16orf62 is a distant homo - log of VPS35 , and has thus been named VPS35L 49 . DSCR3 , on the other hand , is predicted to have a fold analogous to VPS26 , and has been named VPS26C 49 94 . VPS35L , VPS26C and VPS29 form a stable trimeric complex , and co - elute following size - exclusion chromatogra - phy 49 . Due to the similarity with retromer , this new complex has been named “ retriever . ” Knockdown or deletion of VPS35 results in a sub - stantial loss of VPS26A , while VPS35L deletion results in depletion of VPS26C ; interestingly , VPS29 is depleted primarily upon loss of VPS35 and not VPS35L 49 . Importantly , despite the similarities between the retromer and retriever complexes , it is not known whether Rab proteins might also participate in the endosomal recruit - ment of the retriever complex like they do for the retromer complex . However , it is tempting to speculate that mechanisms regulating ret - romer recruitment might also operate to control retriever recruitment because both retromer and retriever share the VPS29 subunit that interacts with the Rab7a GAP TBC1d5 . Significantly , loss of retriever components ( VPS35L and VPS26C ) resulted in defective retrieval of SNX17 cargo from the endo - some 49 , 60 . The mechanism by which SNX17 coupled to the retriever was revealed when a highly conserved 4 amino acid sequence in the C - terminus of SNX17 was found to be necessary and sufficient to interact with VPS26C and recruit SNX17 to endosomes where WASH and the CCC complexes reside 49 . Thus , WASH sits at the nexus of 2 major recycling pathways coordinating both SNX17 and SNX27 cargo retrieval ( Figure 3 ) . 584 WANG ET AL . 6 | CCC COMPLEX Although a role for COMMD1 in regulating copper homeostasis in dogs and mice had been known for some time , the cellular mechanism was unclear 95 . The explanation for this phenotype emerged when COMMD1 was found to associate with CCDC22 and CCDC93 , 2 uncharacterized proteins found to interact with a specific region of the FAM21 C - terminal tail . This interaction is responsible for the recruitment of the CCC complex to endosomes 57 , 60 . Loss of CCC complex components , as well as loss of the retromer subunit VPS35 or SNX27 , lead to impaired endosome to plasma membrane recycling of the copper transporter ATP7A , indicating that CCC is required for recycling of at least certain retromer / SNX27 cargoes 60 . Interestingly , a splice - site mutation in CCDC22 was identified as the causative mutation for X - linked ID in 2 families , a phenotype that resembles defects of WASH function in humans 96 – 98 . Patients with this muta - tion showed a substantial loss of CCDC22 protein , which also impacted the levels of CCDC93 and resulted in the loss of COMMD1 from endosomes . Consistent with the idea that the CCC complex is involved in regulating copper transport , patients harboring CCDC22 mutations showed disturbances in copper handling that are similarly seen in animal models of COMMD1 loss . Another prototypical SNX17 cargo is the LDL receptor ( LDLR ) and other members of this receptor family 99 . Interestingly , mice lack - ing COMMD1 in hepatocytes showed high levels of LDL and choles - terol , which was also observed in patients with CCDC22 deficiency and in patients with Strumpellin mutations associated with ID 99 . Significantly , in mice and cells lacking COMMD1 , the surface levels of LDLR were diminished , suggestive of a recycling defect . In addition , WASH deficiency also resulted in LDLR trafficking defects resulting in LDLR accumulation in lysosomes . In aggregate , studies of both CCC - and WASH - deficient states suggest that defective LDLR trafficking resulting in reduced cell surface expression likely accounts for the increased cholesterol and LDL levels seen in patients . Consistent with a broader role for the CCC in SNX17 - dependent recycling , integrins were also found to be dependent on the CCC complex for proper traf - ficking 49 . Thus , the studies to date indicate that the CCC complex is recruited to endosomes by the FAM21 subunit of WASH and is required for recycling events mediated by retriever / SNX17 as well as retromer / SNX27 . However , the exact mechanism by which it partici - pates in these sorting events remains to be determined . 7 | TBC1D23 In addition to the generation of endosomal vesicles , recent work also provides insights into the mechanisms by which endosomal vesicles are captured by the TGN 61 , 100 . Interestingly , another member of the TBC family , TBC1d23 , plays a critical role in the process . Unlike TBC1d5 , TBC1d23 is apparently catalytically inactive due to muta - tions in key residues important for its GAP activity ( Figure 4A ) . TBC1d23 also harbors a Rhodanese - like domain , which can be found in eukaryotic proteins such as protein phosphatases and ubiquitin FIGURE 4 Function of TBC1d23 in endosomal sorting . A , Domain organization of TBC1d23 and TBC1d5 . Although both proteins possess a TBC domain , TBC1d5 , but not TBC1d23 , is catalytically active . B , A model depicting the function of TBC1d23 in tethering endosomal vesicles with TGN . Left : The WASH and WDR11 complexes decorate endosome - derived vesicles , and TBC1d23 is localized at the TGN through its interaction with Goglin - 97 / 245 . Right : Interaction between TBC1d23 and FAM21 or the WDR11 complex allows tethering and subsequent fusion of endosomal vesicles with the TGN WANG ET AL . 585 ligases , and a C - terminal domain that bears little similarity with other proteins ( Figure 4A ) . The Golgi apparatus has a specific set of proteins , called golgins , which are able to capture vesicles from endosomes , endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi itself 101 , 102 . Among them , golgin - 97 and golgin - 245 are responsible for receiving endosome - derived vesicles . Shin et al found that TBC1d23 bridges the interaction between golgin - 97 , golgin - 245 and endosomal vesicles 61 . The TBC domain of TBC1d23 binds to a conserved region of golgin - 97 and golgin - 245 , and the C terminus binds to FAM21 ( Figure 4B ) . Critically , deletion of TBC1d23 , or deletion of both golgin - 97 and golgin - 245 leads to defective endosome - to - Golgi trafficking of CI - MPR and TGN46 61 . Thus , TBC1d23 links WASH - coated endosomal vesicles to the TGN during endosome - to - TGN retrieval . In addition to golgin - 97 , golgin - 245 and the WASH complex , TBC1d23 also interacts with a trimeric complex consisting of WDR11 , FAM91A1 and C7orf75 ( Figure 4B ) 61 , 100 . Similar to the WASH com - plex , the WDR11 complex associates with vesicles derived from endo - somes , but not with the TGN 100 . The interaction between the WDR11 complex and TBC1d23 is proposed to promote the tethering of vesicles to the TGN ; however , the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated . Intriguingly , homozygous mutation in TBC1d23 has been recently linked with pontocerebellar hypoplasia , a developmental dis - order characterized by impaired growth of the pons and cerebellum , furthering emphasizing the importance of vesicular trafficking in neu - ronal development and function 103 , 104 . 8 | MANIPULATION OF ENDOSOMAL PROTEIN SORTING BY PATHOGENS Given the importance of endosomal sorting pathways for cellular homeostasis and other cellular functions , these pathways emerge as opportune targets by a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens 105 . Pathogens target key sorting protein machineries , such as retromer , SNX proteins and the WASH complex , to promote cellular entry and replication during infection , and to evade degradation . For instance , the envelope glycoprotein of the HIV type - 1 and the tyrosine kinase - interacting ( Tip ) protein of the herpesvirus saimiri bind directly to ret - romer during viral infection 106 , 107 . Human papillomavirus type 16 , and the effector IncE of Chlamydia trachomatis , target to SNX27 and SNX5 / SNX6 , respectively 108 – 110 . The WASH - FAM21 complex is required by Vaccinia Virus for cellular entry and subsequent intracellu - lar transport 111 , 112 . Among all cases , 2 bacterial proteins , RidL and IncE , have been most extensively studied . Biochemical , structural and cellular studies have collectively revealed not only important bacteria - host interactions , but have also uncovered important , but previously less appreciated host regulatory mechanisms . FIGURE 5 Mechanisms of interference of endosomal trafficking by bacterial effector proteins RidL and IncE . A , Model showing how RidL subverts retromer - dependent transport . Left : TBC1d5 is required for retromer - dependent endosomal trafficking . TBC1d5 interacts with both VPS35 and VPS29 . Right : During Legionella pneumophila infection , RidL replaces TBC1d5 , and likely VARP ( not shown ) , to block retromer - mediated trafficking . In contrast with TBC1d5 , RidL interacts only with VPS29 . B , Model showing how IncE inhibits SNX - BAR - dependent transport . Left : SNX - BAR complex mediates endosome - to - TGN transport of certain proteins , such as CI - MPR . Right : Bacterial effector protein IncE interacts with the PX domain of SNX5 / SNX6 , and may inhibit their association with cargo proteins 586 WANG ET AL . Legionella pneumophila is the causative agent of Legionnaires ' dis - ease . During infection , these bacteria reside in a special membrane compartment known as the Legionella - containing vacuole ( LCV ) , 113 which delivers nearly 300 different proteins , known as effectors , to exploit various host functions including vesicle transport . The effector RidL appears to target to retromer and interfere with retromer func - tion , which has been shown to restrict intracellular growth of L . pneumophila 114 . RidL is a large protein with over 1100 amino acids , but lacks sequence homology to known proteins . The interaction between RidL and retromer is mediated by the N - terminal 200 amino acids of RidL and the VPS29 subunit of retromer 23 , 115 , 116 . RidL con - tacts VPS29 with a dissociation constant of approximately 200 nM , similar to the affinity between TBC1d5 and VPS35 / VPS29 23 , 116 . Structural and biochemical studies reveal that both RidL and TBC1d5 bind to a highly conserved hydrophobic surface of VPS29 , opposite to the VPS35 - binding surface 20 , 23 , 115 , 116 . Remarkably , both RidL and TBC1d5 , and likely VARP , interact with VPS29 through a conserved P - L / I motif 23 , 24 , 116 . Outside of this motif , these 3 proteins bear little sequence similarity . In fact , RidL and TBC1d5 have opposite main chain directions in their aligned regions 116 . Consistent with structural analysis , RidL competes with TBC1d5 and VARP in vitro and in vivo 23 , 116 . Thus , RidL interferes with retromer trafficking by out - competing critical endogenous regulators ( Figure 5A ) . In addition to retromer , the N - terminus of RidL also associates with the endosomal lipid PtdIns ( 3 ) P , which aids in the recruitment of RidL together with retromer 116 . Despite these studies , functions of the C - terminus of RidL remain unclear 117 . Since many multiple - domain Legionella effec - tors have related functions in each of their domains , RidL likely regu - lates endosomal trafficking through other mechanisms , such as post - translational modifications of retromer or related proteins . Another pathogenic protein that has been extensively character - ized is the Chlamydial effector protein IncE 110 , 118 – 121 . Chlamydiae infection leads to human blindness , respiratory and genital tract dis - eases . Chlamydiae replicates within a unique membrane - bound com - partment , termed the inclusion . IncE is one of the effector proteins localized on the inclusion membrane , which specifically interacts with SNX5 / SNX6 and inhibits retromer - and SNX5 / SNX6 - mediated endo - somal trafficking 110 . Structural studies from 3 different groups revealed that IncE binds to a conserved hydrophobic groove in the PX domain of SNX5 118 – 120 . Although the exact inhibitory mechanisms exerted by IncE remain to be determined , 2 observations indicate that IncE may function through interfering with the interaction between SNX5 and its cargo , such as IGFR1 and CI - MPR ( Figure 5B ) 118 – 120 . First , a SNX5 mutant unable to bind to IncE shows decreased binding to IGFR1 and CI - MPR 120 . Second , overexpression of IncE reduces co - localization of CI - M6PR with VPS35 , and inhibits the delivery of CI - MPR to the TGN 118 . Therefore , 2 distinct types of bacteria utilize diverse mechanisms to interfere with endosomal sorting . 9 | CONCLUSIONS The last several years have seen remarkable progress in the field of endosomal sorting . In addition to the well - established retromer - dependent trafficking pathway , retriever is found to mediate retromer - independent endosomal trafficking . Remarkably , retriever shows a certain degree of homology to retromer , including complex organization , protein sequences and interaction with SNXs . Addition - ally , several novel protein machineries have been identified and char - acterized to regulate endosomal sorting including the WASH complex , TBC1d5 , TBC1d23 , the CCC complex and WDR11 . The identification of these complexes has allowed the dissection of the mechanistic details of retromer membrane recruitment , cargo recognition , vesicu - lar transport and vesicle tethering with target membranes . Despite this progress , many key questions remain to be answered in the field including but not limited to : 1 are there other complexes that function similar to retromer and retriever ? 2 what is the exact role of the WASH and CCC complexes in retromer and retriever - mediated traf - ficking ? 3 since endosomal proteins can be targeted to both the plasma membrane and the TGN , how are specific trafficking routes selected ? 4 why do viral and bacterial pathogens target endosomal trafficking pathways ? Undoubtedly , answers to these questions will lead us to a better understanding of endosomal receptor trafficking and their functions in organismal development and human disease .
