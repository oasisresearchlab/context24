However , fusion pores have not been observed and thus proved in live cells . Its regulatory mechanisms and functions remain poorly under - stood . With super - resolution STED microscopy , we observed dynamic fusion pore behaviors in live ( neuroendocrine ) cells , including opening , expansion , constriction , and closure , where pore size may vary between 0 and 490 nm within 26 milliseconds to sec - onds ( vesicle size : 180 – 720 nm ) . These pore dynamics crucially determine the efﬁciency of vesicular cargo release and vesicle retrieval . They are generated by competition between pore expansion and constric - tion . Pharmacology and mutation experiments sug - gest that expansion and constriction are mediated by F - actin - dependent membrane tension and cal - cium / dynamin , respectively . These ﬁndings provide the missing live - cell evidence , proving the fusion - pore hypothesis , and establish a live - cell dynamic - pore theory accounting for fusion , ﬁssion , and their regulation . INTRODUCTION Fusion and ﬁssion , which mediate many biological processes , such as exocytosis , endocytosis , intracellular trafﬁcking , cell divi - sion , fertilization , and viral entry , are thought to involve a mem - brane pore for releasing vesicular contents and for membrane scission ( Lindau and Alvarez de Toledo , 2003 ; Chernomordik and Kozlov , 2008 ; Saheki and De Camilli , 2012 ; Alabi and Tsien , 2013 ; Wu et al . , 2014 ; Antonny et al . , 2016 ; Chang et al . , 2017 ) . Four lines of evidence collected in the last half of the century sup - port this view . First , electron microscopy ( EM ) at synapses shows pore - like structures thought to reﬂect fusion or ﬁssion ( Ceccarelli et al . , 1973 ; Heuser and Reese , 1981 ; Miller and Heuser , 1984 ; Koenig and Ikeda , 1989 ; Shupliakov et al . , 1997 ; Watanabe et al . , 2013 ) . However , using EM , it is difﬁcult to determine whether the structure is for fusion , ﬁssion , on the way to expan - sion or closure , or formed by unknown mechanisms . Second , postsynaptic or amperometric current time course , which reﬂects transmitter release , diffusion , and postsynaptic or amperometric current generation , may imply fusion pore dynamics ( Chow etal . , 1992 ; Albillosetal . , 1997 ; Wangetal . , 2003 ; AlabiandTsien , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2016 ) . Third , ﬂuorescently tagged vesicular pro - teins , lipids , or quantum dots loaded into vesicles are released with different kinetics , implying different fusion pore dynamics ( Aravanis et al . , 2003 ; Taraska et al . , 2003 ; Zhang et al . , 2009 ) . Different sizes of ﬂuorescent dyes can be differentially loaded into vesicles , implying different fusion or ﬁssion pore sizes ( Taka - hashi et al . , 2002 ; Vardjan et al . , 2007 ) . A vesicle - like cavity is sometimes observed after content release in PC12 cells , implying a fusion pore that does not collapse ( Taraska et al . , 2003 ) . Fourth , conductance measurements may estimate < (cid:1) 5 nm fusion or ﬁssion pore for < (cid:1) 1 m m vesicles ( Albillos et al . , 1997 ; Klyachko and Jackson , 2002 ; He et al . , 2006 , 2009 ) . However , this estimate assumes a cylindrical geometry with a constant length , solution conductance , and membrane conductance while pore size changes . These assumptions are not veriﬁed , and pores > (cid:1) 5 nm are usually beyond the conductance measurement limit . The above studies lead to a widely held view , referred to here as the ‘‘metastable narrow - pore theory , ’’ that fusion forms a nar - row pore that either closes rapidly to limit the speed and the extent of releasing vesicular cargoes ( kiss - and - run ) or expands irreversibly until ﬂattened ( full collapse ) to promote release , and ﬁssion requires forming a narrow pore wrapped by dynamin or dynamin - like proteins for membrane scission ( Lindau and Al - varez de Toledo , 2003 ; Saheki and De Camilli , 2012 ; Alabi and Tsien , 2013 ; Wu et al . , 2014 ; Antonny et al . , 2016 ; Chang et al . , 2017 ) . Pore regulation under this framework is thought to deter - mine fusion and ﬁssion efﬁciency . However , fusion or ﬁssion pores have not been directly observed and thus proved in any live cells . Tools for direct pore observation in live cells are needed to prove the fusion / ﬁssion pore hypothesis , various hy - pothesized pore behaviors , and the underlying mechanisms and functions . 934 Cell 173 , 934 – 945 , May 3 , 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc . Recently , fusion - generated vesicularly shaped proﬁles were observed with stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) microscopy in neuroendocrine cells containing (cid:1) 300 nm vesicles ( Zhao et al . , 2016 ) , raising the possibility of seeing a fusion pore in live cells . However , the study did not examine or report a fusion pore . Here , we performed STED imaging at (cid:1) 60 nm resolution every 26 – 300 ms , which represents one of the highest spatiotemporal resolution for live - cell membrane structures ( except single - parti - cle tracking and ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy ) ( Lager - holm et al . , 2017 ) . We visualized fusion pore dynamics in live cells for the ﬁrst time , providing the missing live - cell visualization evidence proving the existence of fusion and ﬁssion pore . To our surprise , the metastable narrow - pore theory could not account for live - cell data . Instead , fusion instantly ( < 26 ms ) or slowly opens a pore between 0 and 490 nm , which is two orders of magnitude wider than previously thought ( < (cid:1) 5 nm ) , yet is metastable and does not ﬂatten as full - collapse fusion . Fusion pores of 0 – 490 nm can constrict and close instantly or slowly . Dynamic opening , expansion , constriction , and closure of 0 – 490 nm pores determine fusion and ﬁssion efﬁciency , or the rate of releasing contents and retrieving vesicles . Such dynamic behaviors reﬂect the net outcome of competition between pore expansion and constriction . Expansion involves actin - depen - dent membrane tension , whereas constriction involves calcium and dynamin , as suggested by pharmacology and mutation ex - periments . These ﬁndings establish a live - cell pore theory with extremely dynamic pore behaviors and novel underlying mecha - nisms and functions governing fusion and ﬁssion . RESULTS Observing Fusion Pores in Live Cells Bovine chromafﬁn cells were overexpressed with EGFP or mNeonGreen attached to phospholipase C delta PH domain ( PH G ) , which binds to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ( PIP 2 ) at the plasma mem - brane ( PM ) cytosolic - facing leaﬂet and thus labels PM ( Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . With Atto 532 ( A532 ) in the bath , whole - cell 1 s depolarization ( (cid:3) 80 to + 10 mV , depol 1 s ) ( Figure 1A ) induced calcium currents ( ICa ) , capacitance changes reﬂecting exo - endocytosis ( Figure 1B ) , and A532 spots surrounded by PH G - labeled rings that reﬂected A532 / PH G diffusion from bath / PM to fusion - generated U - proﬁles ( Figure 1C ) ( Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . While PH G rings without A532 may appear due to hemi - fusion ( Zhao et al . , 2016 ) , we focused on fusion pores and thus excluded hemi - fusion from the analysis in this study , unless mentioned otherwise . Images in Figure 1C were obtained at the XY plane with a ﬁxed Z plane near the cell’s bottom under the STED microscope ( XY / Z ﬁx imaging ) . The PH G - labeled ring diameter ( 346 ± 8 nm , 102 rings , 7 cells ) was similar to the vesicle diameter ( Albillos et al . , 1997 ) . We rescanned these structures at the STED XZ plane every 50 nm along y axis ( XZ / Y stack imaging , X , 12 – 15 m m ; Z , 1 – 2 m m ; Y , 1 – 5 m m ; XY resolution , (cid:1) 60 nm ; Z resolution , (cid:1) 150 – 200 nm ; (cid:1) 5 – 23 s / stack ) , conﬁrming these structures as PH G - labeled U - proﬁles ( PH - U ) ( Figure 1D ) . 25 % ± 3 % of PH - U ( 267 PH - U , 21 cells ) showed visible pores ( called Pore v ) ( Figures 1D , 1E , and 1H , left ) . The remaining PH - U pores were permeable to A532 , but not visible ( called Pore noV ) ( Figures 1F – 1H , right ) , because they were smaller than the STED resolution ( (cid:1) 60 nm ) . The PH G line proﬁle across Pore v ( Figure 1E ) , but not Pore noV ( Figure 1G ) , was V shaped with a full - width half - maximum ( W H ) of179 ± 12nm ( 65 – 490nm , 67Pore v ) ( Figure1I ) . Simulationshows thatPore v W H faithfullyreﬂectsporediameterwhenaporeislarger than the STED resolution ( Figure S1 ) . XY - plane images recon - structed from XZ / Y stack images at the pore’s Z plane showed an oval / round pore ( W H : 184 ± 12 nm , n = 67 ) ( Figure 1E ) similar to the corresponding XZ - plane Pore v , conﬁrming the observation of Pore v . As expected from a pore’s geometry , PH - U ’s neck and Pore v were ﬁlled with A532 with a similar shape at both the XZ plane and the XY plane ( Figures 1D , 1E , and 1H , left ) . As the PH - U diameter ranged from 180 to 720 nm ( Figure 1I ) , Pore v W H increased ( Figure1J ) , buttheratiobetweenPore v W H and PH - U diameter ( Pore v / U ) remained similar ( mean : 41 % ± 2 % , 67 Pore v ) ( Figure 1K ) . We noticed large variation in Pore v ’s W H from near 0 up to the PH - U diameter at a similar PH - U diameter ( Figures 1J and 1K ) , a ﬁnding that might reﬂect multiple mecha - nisms in controlling Pore v ( see Results later ) . Four additional sets of evidence further indicated Pore v as the fusion pore . First , when mCLING - A488 ( membrane - binding ﬂuo - rophore - cysteine - lysine - palmitoyl group attached with Atto 488 ) was added in the bath ( Revelo et al . , 2014 ) , it inserted into PM , diffused into , and thus labeled the fusion - generated U - proﬁle , together with overexpressed PH - mCherry ( Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . Pore v ’s W H measured from mCLING - A488 and PH - mCherry was similar ( 153 ± 6 nm vs . 178 ± 5 nm , 8 pores / 8 cells ) ( Fig - ure 2A ) , indicating that Pore v is independent of PIP 2 detection . Second , vesicleswereloadedwithﬂuorescentfalseneurotrans - mitter FFN511 via bath application ( Figure 2B ) ( Gubernator et al . , 2009 ) . Depol 1 s induced PH - U with Pore v that released FFN511 ( Figure 2C , n = 8 ) , indicating Pore v as the fusion pore for releasing FFN511 . IncellsoverexpressedwithNPY - mTurquoise2 ( NPY - mT ) inside granules and PH G ( Figure 2D ) , depol 1 s induced PH - U with Pore v that released NPY - mT ( Figure 2E , n = 4 ) , indicating Pore v as the fusion pore for releasing vesicular contents . Third , EM revealed U - proﬁles with pores of 12 – 430 nm during KCl - induced depolarization ( 92 ± 12 nm , 53 pores , (cid:1) 800 cell cross sections ) ( Figures 2F and 2G ) , similar to the STED - measured Pore v range . Thediameterforpores > 60nm ( 152 ± 18nm , 25pores ) wassimilar to the STED - measured Pore v at (cid:1) 60 nm resolution . All U - proﬁles didnotcontainadensecore ( n = 53 ) ( Figures2Fand2G ) , suggest - ing that the dense core is released via a pore narrower than the densecore . Fourth , therapidPore v opening describedbelowindi - cates fusion pore opening . Rapid Fusion Pore Opening To visualize pore dynamics , we performed STED XZ scanning of PH G / A532every 26 – 300 ms per frame with the Y - focal plane ﬁxed ( XZ / Y ﬁx scanning ) . In 1 , 183 cells subjected to 1 depol 1 s at the whole - cell conﬁguration ( 1 , 183 XZ / Y ﬁx scans ) , depol 1 s induced 236 PH - U having a clear outline and containing a A532 spot ( Fig - ures 2H and 2I ) . We selected PH - U with a clear outline ( Figure S2 ) , because Pore v was evident only at Y - focal planes with clear outline , as revealed by XZ / Y stack imaging ( Figure 1D ) . Among 236 PH - U with clear outlines , 51 ( 49 cells ) showed Pore v ( W H : 142 ± 6 nm ) ( Figures 2H and S3A ) . Pore v was Cell 173 , 934 – 945 , May 3 , 2018 935 identiﬁed as having a V - shape PH G ﬂuorescence line proﬁle , the amplitude of which was > 3 times the standard deviation before fusion ( Figure S3A ) . This large amplitude was not observed at Pore noV ( n = 185 ) ( Figures 2I and S3B ) or without PH - U s ( 300 cells randomly selected ) ( Figure S3C ) . Most ( 43 / 51 ) Pore v was observed simultaneously with A532 spot at their ﬁrst appear - ance , as imaged every 100 – 300 ms ( n = 18 ) , 46 ms ( n = 21 ) or 26 ms ( n = 4 ) , indicating rapid fusion pore opening ( Figures 2H and S3A ) . PH - U at 26 – 46 ms after fusion was much dimmer than at later times ( Figures 2H and 3A ) because of slow PH G diffusion into the U - proﬁle ( see also Zhao et al . [ 2016 ] ) . Pore Expansion , Constriction , Closure , or Unchanged While most ( 43 / 51 ) Pore v were observed at the fusion onset ( Fig - ures 2H and 3A ) , some ( 8 / 51 ) were observed at (cid:1) 0 . 5 – 4 s after fusion ( e . g . , Figure 3B , summarized in 3F ) , suggesting slow Figure 1 .

See also Figure S1 . pore expansion from an A532 - permeable Pore noV to Pore v . This was not due to movements along the y axis , because during XY / Z ﬁx imaging ( Figure 1C ) , U - pro - ﬁles did not move at the XY plane ( 102 events , 7 cells ) ( Figure S4A ) ( see also Chiang et al . [ 2014 ] ) . At the ﬁrst frame Pore v was observed , Pore v reached the maximal size , which was less than the U - proﬁle diameter ( 51 Pore v ) ( Figures 3A – 3E ) . After Pore v appears , it ( 51 pores , 49 cells ) may change in four patterns ( Figure 3F ) : ( 1 ) constriction until pore not visible ( < 60 nm ) , but permeable to A532 ( 17 pores ) ( Figure 3A ) , ( 2 ) pore constriction and closure ( impermeable to A532 , 11 pores ) ( Figure 3C ) , ( 3 ) maintaining a similar size ( nine pores ) ( Figure 3D ) , and ( 4 ) disappearance ( 14 pores ) ( Figure 3E , see Figure S4B for schematic drawing ) , due to rapid U - proﬁle shrinking ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ; Wen et al . , 2016 ) that precluded further analysis . We did not observe Pore v dilation until ﬂattening . After Pore v constricted and closed ( Figure 3C ) , but not just constricted ( Figure 3A ) , A532 spot ﬂuorescence ( excited strongly ) decreased to baseline , due to pore closure that pre - vented bleached A532 ( by strong excitation ) from exchanging with bath ﬂuorescent A532 ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ; Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . A similar A532 spot ﬂuorescence decrease was observed 936 Cell 173 , 934 – 945 , May 3 , 2018 when Pore noV closed ( Figure S4C ) . The A532 ﬂuorescence decrease is not due to a constricted pore smaller than A532 molecule size ( (cid:1) 1 . 2 nm ) ( Erickson , 2009 ) , because after the spot ﬂuorescence decrease , bath application of an acid solution cannot quench the pH - sensitive VAMP2 - EGFP or VAMP2 - pHluorin overexpressed at the same spot , indicating that the spot is impermeable to the smallest molecules like H + and OH (cid:3) , and thus is closed ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ; Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . Pore Expansion and Constriction Speed Since Pore v reached the maximum at their ﬁrst appearance as imaged every 26 ms , dividing Pore v W H by 26 ms yielded a pore expansion rate of > 8 . 9 ± 1 . 0 nm / ms ( n = 4 ) ( Figure 3A ) , the ﬁrst direct measurement of the pore expansion rate . This represents the fastest rate , because delayed expansion ( Fig - ure 3B ) was not included . With 26 ms resolution , the true value Figure 2 .

See also Figures S2 , S3 , and S6 . is underestimated . If within 26 ms , pores are ﬁrst small , and then expand rapidly , as implicated in some pore conductance or amperometric measurements ( Lindau and Alvarez de Toledo , 2003 ) , it is beyond our detection resolution . Pore v could constrict to < 60 nm rapidly ( < 46 – 300 ms , 18 pores ) ( Figures 3C and 5D ) or slowly ( 1 – 20 s , 10 pores ) ( Fig - ure 3A ) . The fastest Pore v constriction was observed within one 46 ms frame from visible to non - visible , yielding a constriction rate of > 3 . 3 ± 0 . 2 nm / ms ( Figure 3C , n = 7 ) . Pore constriction rate was not correlated with the preceding pore expansion rate ( Figure S4D ) , suggesting that expansion and constriction are controlled by different mechanisms . Mechanisms of Constriction and Expansion Since calcium and dynamin trigger and mediate fusion pore closure ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ; Zhao et al . , 2016 ) , we wondered whether they constrict fusion pores . We ﬁrst examined Pore v constriction within (cid:1) 20 s after Pore v was observed , which should be minimally inﬂuenced by the initial pore expansion at the fusion onset . As the ICa density ( ICa divided by the cell membrane capacitance ) increased , the percentage of Pore v that subse - quently constricted and / or closed ( Constrict % , e . g . , Figures 3A and 3C ) increased signiﬁcantly ( Figure 4A ) , suggesting that high calcium inﬂux facilitates constriction . Similarly , replacing bath calcium with strontium ( Sr 2 + ) signiﬁcantly reduced Pore v constrict % ( Figures 4B and 4C , XZ / Y ﬁx imaging ) and thus Pore v Cell 173 , 934 – 945 , May 3 , 2018 937 closure ( see results later ) . Sr 2 + also signiﬁcantly increased the percentage of depol 1 s - induced PH - U with a Pore v ( Pore v % ) , as detected with XZ / Y stack imaging of PH G / A532 every 5 – 23 s , during which Pore v should be converted to Pore noV if constriction occurs ( Figures 4D and 4E ) . These results suggest that calcium inﬂux facilitates Pore v constriction . Similarly , dynasore reduced Pore v constrict % ( Figures 4B and 4C , XZ / Y ﬁx imaging ) ; dynasore or overexpressed dynamin dominant - negative mutant , Dynamin 1 - K44A , increased Pore v % detected with XZ / Y stack imaging every 5 – 23 s ( Figures 4D and 4E ) , suggesting that dynamin may constrict Pore v . Depol 1 s - induced capacitance jumps were similar in control , dynasore , or overexpressed dynamin 1 - K44A ( Figure S5A ) , suggesting that dynamin does not play a major role in regulating release induced by depol 1 s . XZ / Y ﬁx imaging every 26 – 300 ms showed that Sr 2 + and dyna - sore increased Pore v % at the beginning of fusion ( Figure 4F ) , suggesting that calcium / dynamin - dependent constriction may Figure 3 .

Consistently , Pore v % at the beginning of fusion decreased as the ICa density increased from (cid:1) 26 to (cid:1) 61 pA / pF in control cells ( Figure 4G , XZ / Y ﬁx ) , suggesting that strong calcium inﬂux facilitates constric - tion and thus may compete with pore expansion at the beginning of fusion . Interestingly , Pore v % at the beginning of fusion was lower when the ICa density was very low , (cid:1) 9 pA / pF ( Figure 4G , bell shaped ) , supporting a role of calcium in pore expansion . It is likely that high cal - cium inﬂux initiates strong constriction to overcome calcium - dependent initial pore expansion , resulting in Pore v % reduction at higher ICa density ( Figure 4G ) . While only one data point is consistent with calcium in pore expansion , multiple sets of data measured every 26 – 300 ms or 5 – 23 s at and after fusion onset in different ICa density or in Sr 2 + ( Figures 4A – 4G ) suggest that high calcium inﬂux facilitates pore constriction at and after fusion onset . To determine whether membrane tension facilitates pore expansion ( reviewed in Alabi and Tsien [ 2013 ] ) , we increased the bathosmolarityfrom310 ( control ) to650mOsm , which decreases cell volume , reduces membrane tension , and inhibits U - proﬁle shrinking in chromafﬁn cells ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ; Tsujita et al . , 2015 ; Wen et al . , 2016 ) . Increased osmolarity reduced the Pore v % from (cid:1) 25 % – 56 % to (cid:1) 13 % – 16 % in the presence of Ca 2 + ( bath ) , Sr 2 + , or dynasore ( Figure 4H , XZ / Y stack imaging ) and increased the Pore noV percentage correspondingly ( Figure S5B ) . Thus , even with Sr 2 + or dynasore to inhibit constriction ( Figures 4B – 4F ) , reducing membrane tension inhibited pore expansion 938 Cell 173 , 934 – 945 , May 3 , 2018 Figure 4 .

The increasedosmolaritydid not signiﬁcantlyaffectde - pol 1 s - induced capacitance jump ( Figure S5C ) or the hemi - fusion events ( FiguresS5DandS5E ) , suggestingthatincreasedosmolar - ity does not signiﬁcantly affect release induced by depol 1 s . Filamentous actin ( F - actin ) maintains PM tension ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ; Tsujita et al . , 2015 ; Wen et al . , 2016 ) . In chromafﬁn cells , Latrunculin A ( Lat A ) disrupts F - actin polymerization , re - duces membrane tension , and mimics the increased bath osmo - larity ( reducing membrane tension ) in inhibiting shrink fusion ( for details , see Wen et al . [ 2016 ] ) . Lat A decreased the Pore v % at the beginning of fusion in the absence or presence of Sr 2 + or dyna - sore ( Figure 4I , XZ / Y ﬁx imaging ) , suggesting that F - actin - depen - dent membrane tension is needed for pore expansion . Taken together , these results ( Figures 4A – 4I ) suggest that calcium / dynamin - dependent pore constriction competes with F - actin / tension - dependent pore expansion , the net outcome of which generates various pore dynamics ( Figure 4J ) . Further sup - porting this suggestion , dynamin 2 - EGFP ( or dynamin 1 - EGFP ) puncta were present at the PM , as labeled with A532 ( Figure 4K ) ( Zhao et al . , 2016 ) , and were associated with most NPY - mT - labeled granules docked at the PM ( 108 / 144 granules , 12 cells ) ( Figure 4K , left ) . Lifeact - TagGFP2 - labeled F - actin was also asso - ciated with PM and docked NPY - mT - labeled granules ( 57 / 61 granules , 8 cells ) ( Figure 4K , right ) ( Gabel et al . , 2015 ; Wen et al . , 2016 ) . 1 - 5 dynamin 2 - mTurquoise2 puncta surrounded PH G - labeled Pore v induced by depol 1 s ( 32 / 32 Pore v , 9 cells ) ( Figure 4L , XZ / Y stack imaging ) . Thus , dynamin may physically surround large Pore v for constriction . Pore Dynamics Decide Exo - and Endocytosis Efﬁciency A532 and PH G diffusion into PH - U s was much faster through Pore v than through Pore noV ( Figures 5A – 5C ) . Similarly , for gran - ules loaded with FFN511 ( Figure 2B ) , FFN511 release through PH G - labeled Pore v was (cid:1) 12 times faster than through Pore noV ( Figures 5D – 5F ) . These results suggest that larger / faster pore expansion releases transmitters and exchanges contents / lipids more rapidly . Inhibiting constriction with Sr 2 + or dynasore increased the Pore v % ( Figures 4E and 4F ) , shortened the time of A532 and PH G diffusion into U - proﬁles ( Figure 5G ) , blocked fusion pore closure ( Figure 5H ) , and inhibited capacitance - measured whole - cell endocytosis ( Figure 5I ) . These results suggest that pore constriction limits vesicular cargo release and exchange with the bath solution , but serves as a prerequisite step for fusion pore closure and endocytosis . Redeﬁning Kiss - and - Run Concept : Pore Size and Release Rate Pore v closure ( Figure 3C ) predicts rapid / complete content release , in contrast to a popular notion that kiss - and - run mostly involves rapid closure of a narrow fusion pore to limit release ( re - viewed in Alabi and Tsien [ 2013 ] ; Wu et al . [ 2014 ] ; Chang et al . [ 2017 ] ) . To test this prediction , we performed confocal cell - bot - tom XY / Z ﬁx imaging of NPY - EGFP overexpressed in the vesicu - lar lumen with Alexa 647 ( A647 ) in the bath . We used confocal im - aging , as STED was not needed and bleaching was less . Depol 1 s induced NPY - EGFP spot release , accompanied by sudden A647 spot appearance at the same location ( Figures 6A – 6E , 218 spots , 28 cells ) , due to A647 diffusion into the fusion - generated U - proﬁle ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ) . A647 spots ( under strong excita - tion ) changed in three patterns ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ) : ( 1 ) spot dimming while spot size remained unchanged , termed ‘‘close fusion’’ ( U - proﬁle pore closure ) ( Figure 6A ) , ( 2 ) persistent spot presence , termed ‘‘stay fusion’’ ( U - proﬁle with an open pore ) ( Figure 6B , left ) , and ( 3 ) spot shrinking until undetectable , termed ‘‘shrink fusion’’ ( U - proﬁle shrinking and merging with PM ) ( Fig - ure 6B , right ) . Close fusion ( after closure ) is impermeable not only to A647 but also to the smallest molecules like H + and OH - ; and the U - proﬁle size may change before pore closure or during stay fusion ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ) . Consistent with previous studies ( Taraska et al . , 2003 ; Perrais et al . , 2004 ) , NPY - EGFP spot release could be rapid ( < 2 s ) ( Fig - ures6A and6B ) , slow ( Figure 6C ) , partial , or negligible ( Figure 6D ) ( summarized in Figure 6E , 218 spots , 28 cells ) . NPY - EGFP release was sometimes preceded by a ﬂuorescent increase ( Figures 6C and 6D ) , due to pore opening that increased the ve - sicular lumen pH and thus the pH - sensitive EGFP ﬂuorescence ( Taraska et al . , 2003 ) . 95 % ( 90 out of 95 ) of close fusion events detected with A647 imaging released NPY - EGFP completely and mostly ( C ) Constrict % ( mean + SEM ) of Pore v in control ( 35 cells , 37 Pore v ) , Sr 2 + ( 7 cells , 8 Pore v ) , or DnS ( 12 cells , 13 Pore v ) . * p < 0 . 05 ; * * p < 0 . 01 ; * * * p < 0 . 001 ( t test , compared to control , applies to all bar graphs ) .

See also Figure S5 . 940 Cell 173 , 934 – 945 , May 3 , 2018 rapidly ( < 2 s ) with a 20 % – 80 % decay time similar to non - close fusion , which included stay and shrink fusions ( Figures 6A , 6B , and 6E ) . Thus , like non - close fusion , most close fusion involves a pore much larger than the (cid:1) 4 nm EGFP molecule ( Palm et al . , 1997 ) . The remaining 5 % of close fusions did not release NPY - EGFP , but was permeable to A647 before closure ( Figures 6D , left , and 6E ) . 9 % ( 11 / 123 ) of non - close fusions released NPY - EGFP slowly ( 6 – 12 s ) ( Figures 6C and 6E ) , and 0 . 8 % ( 1 / 123 ) of non - close fusions partially released NPY - EGFP ( Figures 6D , right , and 6E ) . The slow or partial release of non - close fusions was due to stay fusion ( Figures 6C and 6D , right ) . Thus , both close fusion and non - close fusion occasionally limited content release , consistent with studies showing small fusion pore conductance and slow or partial release mostly at low frequencies ( Alabi and Tsien , 2013 ; Wu et al . , 2014 ) . We concluded that close fusion mostly involved a pore much larger than the 4 nm EGFP for rapid / complete release . Close fusion , which may open and close Pore v within hun - dreds of milliseconds ( Figure 3C ) ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ) , can approach the speed of ultrafast endocytosis , an endocytic form thought to take < (cid:1) 100 ms , but involves membrane invag - ination , large pit and bulk endosome formation at non - release sites of synapses ( Watanabe et al . , 2013 ) . It is beyond the scope of the present work to determine whether ultrafast endocytosis occurs in our system . Figure 5 .

DISCUSSION The fusion pore hypothesis has been accepted , but not proved with direct live - cell visualization . The metastable - narrow - pore theory is thought to govern fusion via a metastable narrow pore ( < (cid:1) 5 nm ) that either closes ( kiss - and - run ) or expands until ﬂattened ( full - collapse ) ( reviewed in Alabi and Tsien [ 2013 ] ; Wu et al . [ 2014 ] ) . Regulation of release is often attributed to regulation of kiss - and - run and full - collapse , thought to limit and facilitate release , respectively . By observing fusion - generated U - proﬁles with a pore that releases vesicular contents in live chromafﬁn cells ( Figures 1 , 2 , and 5D ) , we provide the missing live - cell evidence proving the fusion - pore hypothesis . Our results establish a dynamic - pore theory ( Figure 4J ) that offers signiﬁcant advances over the narrow - pore theory , as detailed below . We found that the metastable pore size range ( 0 – 490 nm ) ( Fig - ures 1 and 2 ) is two orders of magnitude wider than previously thought ( < (cid:1) 5 nm ) . A large dynamic range of pores between 0 to 490 nm or between 0 and the vesicle width ( Figures 1J and 1K ) can expand , constrict , and / or close at various rates ranging from near 0 to > 8 . 9 nm / s ( Figure 3 ) , resulting in diverse pore dynamics that generates diverse rates of content release and vesicle retrieval ( Figures 5 and 6 ) . These dynamic pore behaviors result from competition between expansion and constriction , involving actin - dependent membrane tension and calcium / dynamin ( Fig - ure 4 ) , respectively , to provide powerful expansion and constric - tion forces . The pore may disappear because of U - proﬁle shrink - ing that merges the U - proﬁle with the PM ( Figure 3E ) ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ; Wen et al . , 2016 ) . If the U - proﬁle shrinks such that its depth is smaller than its pore , it literally becomes a full - collapse fusion ( Figure S4B ) . This scenario , although beyond our detection limittotest , mayreconcilethe apparentdifferencebetween shrink fusion and full - collapse fusion . These complex pore behaviors Cell 173 , 934 – 945 , May 3 , 2018 941 cannot be accounted for by the narrow - pore theory . We therefore suggest a dynamic - pore theory to account for our results and many years of published data interpreted under the narrow - pore theory . The dynamic - pore theory ( Figure 4J ) advances the nar - row - poretheory in three aspects . First , the metastable porerange increasesfrom < (cid:1) 5nmto < (cid:1) 490nmortothevesiclewidth , andit serves as the decision point not just for subsequent closure and collapse , but for expansion , constriction , closure , no change , and disappearance via U - proﬁle shrinking ( Figure S4B ) . Second , the release rate does not simply depend on narrow pore closure or full - collapse , but on competition between expansion and constriction that generates various sizes of pores at diverse rates . Third , F - actin - dependent tension and calcium / dynamin mediate expansionandconstriction , respectively , assuggestedfromphar - macological and mutation experiments . The dynamic - pore theory redeﬁnes kiss - and - run concept and how fusion pore controls release . Traditional kiss - and - run , which involves mostly rapid closure of a narrow pore to limit the extent andrateofrelease ( AlabiandTsien , 2013 ; Wuetal . , 2014 ) , isrede - Figure 6 .

Kiss - and - run ( close fusion ) is not the only fusion mode that canlimitrelease . Non - kiss - and - run , partic - ularly stay fusion , may also limit release via a narrow pore ( Figures 5 and 6 ) . Conse - quently , decades of studies that interpret rapid / complete release , pores beyond conductance measurement resolution of (cid:1) 3 – 5 nm , or release of (cid:1) 20 nm quantum dots as full - collapse fusion , and otherwise as kiss - and - run , may be subject to errors ( Albillos et al . , 1997 ; Klyachko and Jack - son , 2002 ; Taraska et al . , 2003 ; Lindau and Alvarez de Toledo , 2003 ; He et al . , 2006 ; Doreian et al . , 2008 ; Zhang et al . , 2009 ; Alabi and Tsien , 2013 ; Wu et al . , 2014 ; Chang et al . , 2017 ) . With overwhelming observations of rapid / complete release and / or large pores attributed to full - collapse , kiss - and - run may be signiﬁcantly underestimated , and thus may be more widespread than previously recognized . Supporting this possibility , kiss - and - run in chromafﬁn cells is a major endocytic mechanism ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ; Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . Pore conductance measurements reveal that kiss - and - run can involve a pore larger than the detec - tion limit , (cid:1) 3 – 5 nm , which may generate rapid / complete release in mast cells ( Spruce et al . , 1990 ) , chromafﬁn cells ( Ale´s et al . , 1999 ) , and calyx of Held nerve terminals ( He et al . , 2006 ) . The vol - ume occupied bythevesicle inPC12cells maysometimes remain after releasing a large luminal protein , tissue plasminogen acti - vator , implying kiss - and - run or stay fusion with a large pore ( Taraska et al . , 2003 ) . Knowing that close fusion does not necessarily limit content release , decades of studies that interpret different extents and rates of release as kiss - and - run and non - kiss - and - run fusion are no longer accurate . Based on the correlation between the directly measured pore size and the rate of FFN511 release or 942 Cell 173 , 934 – 945 , May 3 , 2018 PH G / A532 diffusion into fusing U - proﬁles ( Figure 5 ) , we suggest that diverse release rates and their regulation reported in previ - ous studies reﬂect regulation of fusion pore dynamics under the dynamic - pore theory . Consistent with this suggestion , cate - cholamine release rate is correlated with the fusion pore conduc - tance ( Albillos et al . , 1997 ; Ale´s et al . , 1999 ) . Different fre - quencies of nerve stimulation induce differential release of catecholamine and neuropeptides in chromafﬁn cells , implying that fusion pore dynamics may regulate release in physiological conditions ( Fulop et al . , 2005 ) . Compared to the narrow - pore theory where release is either limited by narrow pore closure or facilitated by full - collapse , the dynamic - pore theory offers more accurate control of content release by regulating pore size and expansion rate in a much larger dynamic range . Furthermore , the dynamic - pore theory de - couples the control of release with endocytosis , whereas the narrow - pore theory links inhibition and facilitation of release to rapid kiss - and - run and classical endocytosis ( following full - collapse ) , respectively . Thus , it is advantageous for cells to employ dynamic - pore mechanisms to control release and endo - cytosis independently and accurately . Since Pore v / U remained similar and did not exceed 100 % in U - proﬁles ranging from 180 to 720 nm ( Figure 1K ) , our results may apply to smaller vesicles . Indeed , even for (cid:1) 30 – 40 nm U - proﬁles in neurons , pores as large as 5 – 40 nm were observed ( Heuser and Reese , 1981 ; Watanabe et al . , 2013 ; Wen et al . , 2016 ) . If our results apply to synapses containing 30 – 50 nm ves - icles , release of an (cid:1) 20 nm quantum dot , which was attributed to full - collapse fusion ( Zhang et al . , 2009 ) , could be mediated by kiss - and - run . Kiss - and - run at synapses might thus be more abundant than previously thought . Verifying this implication would be an important future research direction . F - actin facilitates content release ( Berberian et al . , 2009 ) and dynamin limits release ( Tsuboi et al . , 2004 ; Trexler et al . , 2016 ) , implicating regulation of fusion pores by F - actin and dynamin ( Tsuboi et al . , 2004 ; Berberian et al . , 2009 ; Trexler et al . , 2016 ) . Direct pore visualization combined with pharmacological manip - ulation and mutation suggests that F - actin provides membrane tension to expand the pore and dynamin constricts the pore ( Figure 4 ) . Dynamin was proposed to expand ( Graham et al . , 2002 ; Anantharam et al . , 2011 ; Trexler et al . , 2016 ) or stabilize the fusion pore ( Holroyd et al . , 2002 ; Tsuboi et al . , 2004 ; Trexler et al . , 2016 ) , although neither proposal was supported by direct pore - dynamics evidence . Pore - dynamics imaging sug - gests that dynamin surrounds and constricts 65 – 490 nm pores , which counteracts pore expansion ( Figure 4 ) . A new model may be needed to account for dynamin wrapping and constriction of large pores , given that current models only ac - count for (cid:1) 5 – 20 nm narrow pores ( Antonny et al . , 2016 ) . Constricting the large pore of U - proﬁles or membrane invagi - nations is an essential endocytic step toward forming a narrow pore for ﬁssion , but is poorly understood . Here , we visualized constriction of 65 – 490 nm pores , showed the involvements of calcium / dynamin in constriction , and found that constriction is crucial in mediating endocytosis , closing fusion pores , and limiting cargo release ( Figures 3 , 4 , and 5 ) . These ﬁndings may be of general signiﬁcance , because calcium / dynamin - depen - dent pore constriction may contribute to mediating calcium / dy - namin - dependent endocytosis , calcium / dynamin - dependent fusion pore closure , and dynamin - dependent receptor - medi - ated endocytosis widely observed in endocrine cells , neurons , and non - secretory cells ( Saheki and De Camilli , 2012 ; Wu et al . , 2014 ; Chiang et al . , 2014 ; Antonny et al . , 2016 ) . Calcium binding with synaptotagmins triggers fusion pore opening and facilitates initial fusion pore opening within (cid:1) 5 nm , as detected with pore conductance measurements ( Sce - pek et al . , 1998 ; Segovia et al . , 2010 ) . Consistent with this ﬁnding , we observed an increase of Pore v % ( Figure 4G ) as the ICa density increased from a very low value to a medium level , at which constriction force was not maximal ( Figure 4A ) . It is likely that calcium may facilitate both expansion and constric - tion , but favor expansion and constriction at low and high ICa , respectively . Calcium sensors , such as calmodulin and syn - aptotagmin 1 , which are involved in endocytosis ( reviewed in Wu et al . [ 2014 ] ) , are candidates for mediating calcium - dependent constriction . The technique and theory presented here provide an imaging tool and new theoretical foundation to study pore dynamics of many processes , such as exocytosis , endocytosis , intracellular trafﬁcking , fertilization , and viral entry . Although our STED reso - lution is (cid:1) 60 nm , pore resolution may reach (cid:1) 40 nm , because PH G was attached to the PM cytosolic leaﬂet , which was the pore membrane outer leaﬂet ( for details , see STAR Methods and Figure S6 ) . With (cid:1) 40 – 60 nm resolution per 26 – 300 ms , we could not examine 0 – 40 nm fusion pore within milliseconds of fusion , during which small - molecule transmitters are often released ( Chang et al . , 2017 ) . Improving spatiotemporal resolu - tion will be crucial in overcoming this problem in the future . In summary , we visualize fusion and ﬁssion pore dynamics in live cells and establish a dynamic - pore theory with novel pore dynamics , underlying mechanisms , and key functions accounting for fusion , endocytosis , and their regulations . We redeﬁne the kiss - and - run concept and suggest reinterpreting release and fusion pore data in previous studies with the dynamic - pore theory . Our results suggest that calcium and dy - namin act in mediating large - pore constriction , which is essential for endocytosis , fusion pore closure , and counteracting F - actin / tension - dependent pore expansion . These ﬁndings may be of widespread applicability , given that pore dynamics mediate many biological processes , including exocytosis , endocytosis , intracellular trafﬁcking , cell - cell or organelle - organelle fusion / di - vision , fertilization , and viral entry .

W . Treuth and Sons , Inc . ) were used to prepare primary chromafﬁn cell culture , which are widely used for the study of exo - and endocytosis ( Lindau and Alvarez de Toledo , 2003 ; Wu et al . , 2014 ) . METHOD DETAILS Chromafﬁn cell culture We prepared primary bovine adrenal chromafﬁn cell culture as described previously ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ) . Fresh adult ( 21 - 27 months old ) bovine adrenal glands ( from a local abattoir ) were immersed in pre - chilled Locke’s buffer on ice containing : NaCl , 145 mM ; KCl , 5 . 4 mM ; Na2HPO4 , 2 . 2 mM ; NaH2PO4 , 0 . 9 mM ; glucose , 5 . 6 mM ; HEPES , 10 mM ( pH 7 . 3 , adjusted with NaOH ) . Glands were perfused with Locke’s buffer , then infused with Locke’s buffer containing collagenase P ( 1 . 5 mg / ml , Roche ) , trypsin inhibitor ( 0 . 325 mg / ml , Sigma ) and bovine serum albumin ( 5 mg / ml , Sigma ) , and incubated at 37 (cid:4) C for 20 min . The digested medulla was minced in Locke’s buffer , and ﬁltered through a 100 m m nylon mesh . The ﬁltrate was centrifuged ( 48 xg , 5 min ) , re - suspended in Locke’s buffer and re - centrifuged until the supernatant was clear . The ﬁnal cell pellet was re - suspended in pre - warmed DMEM me - dium ( GIBCO ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( GIBCO ) . Electroporation and plating Cells were transfected by electroporation using Basic Primary Neurons Nucleofector Kit ( Lonza ) , according to the manufacturer’s protocol and plated onto poly - L - lysine ( 0 . 005 % w / v , Sigma ) and laminin ( 4 m g / ml , Sigma ) coated glass coverslips . The cells were incubated at 37 (cid:4) C with 9 % CO2 and used within 5 days . Plasmids and ﬂuorescent dyes The PH - EGFP ( phospholipase C delta PH domain attached with EGFP ) was obtained from Dr . Tamas Balla . NPY - EGFP and PH - mCherry were purchased from Addgene . Lifeact - TagGFP2 was purchased from Abidi ( Germany ) . NPY - mTurquoise2 ( NPY - mT ) construct was created by replacing the EGFP tag of NPY - EGFP with mTurquoise2 ( Addgene ) . PH - mNeonGreen construct was created by replacing the EGFP tag of PH - EGFP with mNeonGreen ( Allele Biotechnology ) ( Shaner et al . , 2013 ) . Both PH - EGFP and PH - mNeonGreen are abbreviated as PH G . Dynamin 2 - mTurquoise2 construct was created by replacing the EGFP tag of dyna - min 2 - EGFP ( Addgene ) with mTurquoise2 ( Addgene ) . Dynamin 1 - K44A - mRFP was purchased from Addgene . For imaging , the dye concentration in the bath solution was : Atto 532 ( A532 , Sigma ) , 30 m M ; Alexa 647 ( A647 , Sigma ) , 30 m M . For experiments using membrane - binding ﬂuorophore - cysteine - lysine - palmitoyl group attached with Atto 488 ( mCLING - A488 , Synaptic Systems ) , before imaging was performed , 0 . 5 m M mCLING - A488 was added into the bath solution for 10 min and then washed out . For FFN511 ( Abcam ) imaging , cells were bathed with FFN511 ( 5 - 10 m M ) for 3 min and images were performed after washing out FFN511 in the bath solution . Overexpression of PH G or NPY - EGFP did not signiﬁcantly affect the basic properties of exo - and endocytosis , because 1 ) whole - cell capacitance measurements and imaging show robust exo - and endocytosis , and similar percentages of close - fusion and non - close - fusion as control ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ; Zhao et al . , 2016 ) , and 2 ) U - proﬁle’s pore could also be resolved by imaging extracellularly applied mCLING - A488 or by EM ( Figure 2 ) . Electrophysiology At room temperature ( 20 - 22 (cid:4) C ) , whole - cell voltage - clamp and capacitance recordings were performed with an EPC - 10 ampliﬁer together with the software lock - in ampliﬁer ( PULSE , HEKA , Lambrecht , Germany ) ( Lindau and Neher , 1988 ; Chiang et al . , 2014 ) . The holding potential was (cid:3) 80 mV . For capacitance measurements , the frequency of the sinusoidal stimulus was 1000 - 1500 Hz with a peak - to - peak voltage % 50 mV . The bath solution contained 125 mM NaCl , 10 mM glucose , 10 mM HEPES , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 4 . 5 mM KCl , 0 . 001 mM TTX and 20 mM TEA , pH 7 . 3 adjusted with NaOH . The pipette ( 2 – 4 M U ) solution contained 130 mM Cs - glutamate , 0 . 5 mM Cs - EGTA , 12 mM NaCl , 30 mM HEPES , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM ATP , and 0 . 5 mM GTP , pH 7 . 2 adjusted with CsOH . These solutions pharmacologically isolated calcium currents . For stimulation , we used a 1 s depolarization from the holding potential of (cid:3) 80 mV to + 10 mV ( depol 1 s ) . We used this stimulus , because it induces robust exo - endocytosis as reﬂected in capacitance recordings ( Figure 1B ) ( Engisch and Nowycky , 1998 ; Perrais et al . , 2004 ; Chiang et al . , 2014 ) . STED imaging STED images were acquired with Leica TCS SP8 STED 3 3 microscope that is equipped with a 100 3 1 . 4 NA HC PL APO CS2 oil immersion objective and operated with the LAS - X imaging software . Excitation was with a tunable white light laser and emission was detected with hybrid detectors . In time - gated STED mode , PH - EGFP and A532 were sequentially excited at 470 and 532 nm , res - pectively , with the 592 nm STED depletion beam , and their ﬂuorescence collected at 475 - 525 nm and 540 - 587 nm , respectively . Cell 173 , 934 – 945 . e1 – e5 , May 3 , 2018 e2 PH - mNeonGreen and A532 were sequentially excited at 485 and 540 nm , respectively , with the 592 nm STED depletion beam , and their ﬂuorescence collected at 490 - 530 nm and 545 - 587 nm , respectively . mCLING - A488 and PH - mCherry were sequentially excited at 488 and 570 nm , respectively , with the 660 nm STED depletion beam , and their ﬂuorescence collected at 504 - 555 nm and 575 - 650 nm , respectively . For three - color STED imaging with 592 nm STED depletion laser , dynamin 2 - EGFP ( or Lifeact - TagGFP2 ) , NPY - mT , and A532 were excited at 488 nm , 442 nm , and 540 nm , respectively , and their ﬂuorescence collected at 493 - 535 nm , 447 - 482 nm , and 545 - 587 nm , respectively . PH - mNeonGreen and FFN511 ( or dynamin 2 - mTurquoise2 or NPY - mTurquoise2 ) were sequentially excited at 505 and 442 nm , respectively , with the 592 nm STED depletion beam , and their ﬂuorescence collected at 510 - 587 nm and 447 - 490 nm , respectively . The excitation power for A532 was 10 % of the maximum , at which ﬂuorescent A532 can be bleached within a few seconds . This feature was used to distinguish whether the fusion pore is closed or not , because pore closure prevents bleached A532 ( caused by strong excitation ) from exchange with ﬂuorescent A532 in the bath , resulting in A532 spot ﬂuorescence decay ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ) . In contrast , an open pore would not cause A532 spot ﬂuorescence decay , because an open pore allows for continuous exchange of bleached A532 in the U - proﬁle with ﬂuorescent A532 in the bath ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ) . STED imaging generally causes more photobleaching and phototoxicity . Severe phototoxicity could cause loss of the whole - cell giga seal during patch - clamp recording ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ) . We avoided severe phototoxicity by applying only one depol 1 s and im - aging for only (cid:1) 30 - 40 s per cell . With this setting , we have not noticed signiﬁcant differences in the exo - and endocytosis properties obtained under confocal and STED imaging conditions ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ; Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . For imaging of PH G and A532 , contin - uous exchange of bleached PH G or A532 with ﬂuorescent ones from non - imaging areas lessened the photobleaching problem . STED scanning modes STED images were acquired at the cell bottom with the XY ( parallel to the coverslip ) or XZ ( perpendicular to the coverslip ) scanning mode ( Figure 1A ) . For XY / Z ﬁx scanning ( Z focal plane was ﬁxed at (cid:1) 100 - 200 nm above the cell bottom ) , images were acquired every 200 - 300 ms at 15 nm per pixel in an XY area of (cid:1) 10 - 15 m m x (cid:1) 10 - 15 m m ( Figure 1C ) . Most experiments were performed at the XZ / Y ﬁx scanning mode at the cell bottom , at which images were acquired every 26 - 300 ms at 15 nm per pixel in an XZ area of 19 . 4 m m x 0 . 7 - 1 . 5 m m , with a ﬁxed y axis location ( e . g . , Figure 3 ) . We used 300 ms per XZ frame at the beginning of this project , but used 46 - 100 ms as we realized the importance of catching fast events with fast imaging rates . Sometimes , we used 26 ms per XZ frame to determine the maximal rate of pore expansion . To reconstruct 3 - D structure of fusion - generated U - proﬁles , XZ images ( x axis , 12 - 15 m m ; Z axis , 1 - 2 m m ) were also acquired alone y axis every 50 nm for 1 - 5 m m ( XZ / Y stack scanning , collected within (cid:1) 5 - 23 s ) . The STED resolution for imaging PH G ( PH - EGFP or PH - mNeonGreen ) in our conditions was (cid:1) 60 nm on the microscopic X - and y axis ( parallel to cell - bottom membrane or coverslip ) , and (cid:1) 150 - 200 nm on the microscopic Z axis . The probability of observing a PH - U - proﬁle with clear outline during a XZ / Y ﬁx scan after depol 1 s was (cid:1) 0 . 2 ( observing 236 U - proﬁles from 1183 XZ / Y ﬁx scans after depol 1 s ) . STED images were deconvolved using Huygens software ( Scientiﬁc Volume Imaging ) . STED pore closure identiﬁcation During XZ / Y ﬁx imaging , A532 was excited at a high laser power so that ﬂuorescent A532 can be bleached with a time constant of 1 . 5 - 3 . 5 s . Pore closure was identiﬁed as the gradual dimming of the A532 spot ﬂuorescence to baseline during XZ / Y ﬁx PH G / A532 imaging . Figure 3C shows an example for Pore v constriction and closure , and Figure S4C shows an example for Pore noV closure . A532 ﬂuorescence dimming is due to pore closure that prevents bleached A532 ( by strong excitation ) from exchange with a large reservoir of ﬂuorescent A532 ( very small molecule , (cid:1) 1 . 2 nm ) in the bath . This is not due to a narrow pore smaller than A532 molecule size , because after spot dimming , bath application of an acid solution cannot quench the pH - sensitive VAMP2 - EGFP or VAMP2 - pHluorin overexpressed at the same spot , indicating that the spot is impermeable to H + or OH - , the smallest molecules , and thus is closed ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ; Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . Furthermore , the closure time course calculated from spot dimming matches approximately with whole - cell endocytosis time course ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ) , and inhibition of dynamin by dynamin inhibitors , dyna - min dominant - negative mutant dynamin 1 - K44A , or dynamin knockdown blocks not only whole - cell endocytosis but also pore closure detected with the spot dimming method ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ; Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . These results further conﬁrm that spot dimming under strong excitation reﬂects pore closure . Confocal image acquisition Imaging with A647 and NPY - EGFP were performed with an inverted confocal microscope ( TCS SP5II , Leica , Germany , 100 3 oil objective , numerical aperture : 1 . 4 ) , where A647 ( 30 m M in bath , Sigma ) and NPY - EGFP were excited by a Diode laser at 640 nm ( maximum power : 40 mW ) and an Argon laser at 488 nm ( maximum power : 50 mW ) , respectively . The 640 nm laser was set at 50 % of the maximum power , which could bleach A647 inside the U - proﬁle within a few seconds once the U - proﬁle closed ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ) . The 488 nm laser was set at 1 . 5 - 2 % to avoid signiﬁcant bleaching of NPY - EGFP . A647 ﬂuorescence was collected with a photomultiplier at 650 - 720 nm , whereas NPY - EGFP , at 498 - 580 nm . Both excitation and ﬂuorescence collection were done simul - taneously at the XY / Z ﬁx scanning mode at the cell bottom . Confocal imaging area was (cid:1) 70 - 160 m m 2 at the XY plane with a ﬁxed Z axis focal plane (cid:1) 100 - 200 nm above the cell - bottom membrane . Images were collected every 10 - 33 ms at 50 - 70 nm per pixel at the XY / Z ﬁx scanning mode . e3 Cell 173 , 934 – 945 . e1 – e5 , May 3 , 2018 Fusion mode identiﬁcation during confocal imaging During confocal imaging of A647 ( strong excitation , 50 % maximal power ) and NPY - EGFP ( weak excitation : 1 . 5 % – 2 % maximal po - wer ) at the cell - bottom , we identiﬁed fusion modes based on A647 imaging as characterized in detail in our recent study ( for details , see Chiang et al . [ 2014 ] ) . In brief , close - fusion was identiﬁed if after A647 spot appeared , the spot A647 ﬂuorescence intensity ( F 647 ) decayed to baseline with a time constant more than 2 s ( (cid:1) 2 - 5 s ) while the spot W H did not change . Another form of fusion , the U - shrink fusion , in which the fusion - generated U - proﬁle shrinks until undetectable , could also cause F 647 decay to baseline ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ) . However , this differs from U - proﬁle pore closure in two aspects . First , the decay time constant of most U - shrink events is < 1 . 7 s ( e . g . , Figure 6B ) ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , a decay time constant of > 2 s is a safe criterion for identifying fusion pore closure ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ) . Second , U - shrink fusion is accompanied by a reduction of A647 spot W H , whereas close - fusion is not ( Figures 6A and 6B ) ( Chiang et al . , 2014 ) . These two criteria allowed us to clearly identify close - fusion from shrink - fusion . For stay - fusion , A647 spot persisted , and F 647 did not decay to baseline during our recording time of (cid:1) 30 s . Electron microscopy Bovine chromafﬁn cells were stimulated for 90 s using a solution containing 70 mM KCl , 60 mM NaCl , 10 mM glucose , 10 mM HEPES , 2 mM CaCl 2 , and 1 mM MgCl 2 ( pH 7 . 3 , adjusted with NaOH ) . The cells were then immediately ﬁxed with 2 % glutaraldehyde , 2 % para - formaldehyde and 4 % tannic acid in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer pH 7 . 4 for 15 min , followed by the same ﬁxative without tannic acid for additional 15 min . The cells were washed ﬁrst with a solution of 100 mM glycine in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 min at room temperature , and then with just 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate . After , post ﬁxation with 1 % OsO 4 for 1 hour on ice , the samples were then gradually dehydrated with increasing pure solutions of ethanol ( 50 % , 70 % ) , staining with 2 % Uranyl acetate in 70 % of ethanol for 30 min and continuing with dehydration ( 85 % , 95 % , 100 % ) . Lastly , inﬁltration and embedding with Embed - 812 . The embedded sam - ples were sectioned on an ultramicrotome with thicknesses of 70 - 90 nm . The resulting sections were placed on 200 mesh pioloform coated index grid . Single images were collected at up to 73 , 000X magniﬁcation on a JEOL JEM - 200CX , 120kV electron microscope with an AMT XR - 100 CCD . Simulation Simulation ( in Figure S1 ) was done in Igor Pro ( WaveMetrics ) . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES Data selection For every cell recorded with a pipette under the whole - cell conﬁguration , the data within the ﬁrst 2 min at the whole - cell conﬁguration were used , which avoided rundown of endocytosis ( gradual disappearance of endocytosis ) as previously reported under the whole - cell conﬁguration for a long time ( Smith and Neher , 1997 ; Chiang et al . , 2014 ) . Cells expressed with PH G ( or PH - mCherry ) were used for examining pore dynamics . The criteria for selecting PH - U s for pore analysis during XZ / Y ﬁx scanning are described in Figure S2 and its legends . Visible pores of PH - U - proﬁles ( Pore v ) containing A532 at the XZ frame are identiﬁed based on two criteria : 1 ) the U - proﬁle pore is visible as judged by eyes and A532 spot is inside the U - proﬁle , and 2 ) the F PH line proﬁle across the pore region shows a V - shape valley with an amplitude at least three times larger than the standard deviation of the same F PH line proﬁle before fusion ( e . g . , Figure S3 ) . The V - shape valley amplitude of the F PH line proﬁle was measured as shown in Figure S3A ( see ‘Amp’ in Figure S3A ) . For STED XZ / Y stack analysis of fusion percentages and confocal image analysis of close - fusion and non - close fusion , cells with less than 5 fusion events were not used , which avoided large ﬂuctuations from individual cells and thus improved the accuracy of the per - centage measurement . STED image analysis and pore measurements STED images were analyzed with ImageJ and LAS X ( Leica ) . While U - proﬁles labeled with PH , but ﬁlled with no A532 may appear due to hemi - fusion ( Zhao et al . , 2016 ) , we only analyzed U - proﬁles labeled with PH and ﬁlled with A532 throughout the work , except those shown in Figures S5D and S5E . Pores labeled with PH G , PH - mCherry , or mCLING - A488 at the XZ plane were identiﬁed based on the image and the ﬂuorescence intensity line proﬁle . We ﬁrst identiﬁed the ﬂuorescently labeled U - proﬁles with an open pore , the edge of which was continuous with the plasma membrane ( e . g . , Figures 1D , 1E , 2H , and 3 ) . As judged from the intensity line proﬁle , the ﬂuorescence intensity on the edge of the pore was usually higher than the plasma membrane ( e . g . , Figures 1D and 1E ) , due to a denser membrane area and thus more PH G molecules within our STED resolution limit ( XY : 60 nm ; Z : 150 - 200 nm ) ( see simulation data in Figure S1 ) . The intensity line proﬁle in the pore region should show a valley with a peak at least three times larger than the baseline ﬂuctuation ( standard de - viation ) in the non - pore region ( for detail , see Figures S3A – 3C ) . The full - width - half - maximum ( W H ) of the valley of the intensity line proﬁle across the pore was proportional to the pore diameter , as shown with simulation ( Figure S1 ) . Thus , pore W H faithfully reﬂects pore diameter . During XZ / Y ﬁx scanning , some depol 1 s - induced PH - U - proﬁles were out of the Y ﬁx focal plane , as the outline of the U - proﬁle was vague or unclear ( e . g . , Figure S2B ) . These out - of - focus U - proﬁles were not included for analysis . The criteria for the selection of the U - proﬁle are described in detail in Figure S2 and its legend . Cell 173 , 934 – 945 . e1 – e5 , May 3 , 2018 e4 STED pore resolution Although our STED resolution is (cid:1) 60 nm , the resolution on the pore diameter may reach (cid:1) 40 nm , because the pore diameter measured from PH G attached to PM c ( cytosolic leaﬂet , pore outer leaﬂet ) was longer than the actual pore diameter ( measured from the inner membrane leaﬂet ) by (cid:1) 20 nm . The 20 nm value was approximately equal to 2 times the distance between PM c and PM e ( PM extracellular leaﬂet ) , which was 7 . 3 ± 0 . 1 nm ( electron microscopic estimate , n = 20 cells ) ( Figure S6 ) , plus the (cid:1) 4 nm EGFP molecule size ( Palm et al . , 1997 ) . Supporting this estimate , the PH - mCherry - labeled pore W H was 26 ± 2 nm larger than the pore W H labeled with mCLING - A488 that binds to PM e , the pore membrane inner leaﬂet ( n = 8 , paired t test , p < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 2A ) . Confocal image analysis Confocal images were analyzed with ImageJ and LAS X ( Leica ) . The ﬂuorescence intensity from an area covering the ﬂuorescence spot was measured at every image frame . The full - width - half - maximum ( W H ) was measured from intensity proﬁles of 1 - 4 lines across the spot center . Fusion - generated U - proﬁles may change in seven patterns , which are grouped into three categories : 1 ) the U - proﬁle is maintained while its size may remain unchanged , enlarge , or shrink to some extent , termed stay - fusion , 2 ) the stay fusion is followed by pore closure , termed close - fusion , and 3 ) the U - proﬁle shrinks until undetectable , leading to U - proﬁle merging with the plasma membrane , termed shrink - fusion ( for detail , see Chiang et al . [ 2014 ] ) . Statistical tests Data were expressed as mean ± s . e . m . Replicates are indicated in results and ﬁgure legends . N represents the number of cells , pores , or U - proﬁles as indicated in results and ﬁgure legends . The statistical test used is t test or ANOVA . Although the statistics were per - formed based on the number of cells , pores , and U - proﬁles , each group of data were replicated from at least four primary chromafﬁn cell cultures . Each culture was from at least two glands from one bovine . In several experimental groups , PH - U number was around or slightly more than 10 . However , the statistical test was highly signif - icant . Furthermore , our conclusions did not rely on a single statistical test , but on statistical tests in multiple conditions that consol - idate our conclusions . For example , both Figures 4E and 4F show that Sr 2 + and dynasore increased Pore v % ; reduction of Pore v % by the increased osmolarity was repeatedly shown in the presence of calcium , Sr 2 + , or dynasore ( Figure 4H ) ; reduction of Pore v % by Lat A was repeatedly shown in the presence of calcium , Sr 2 + , or dynasore ( Figure 4I ) . In 123 non - close - fusion events , only one released NPY - EGFP partially ( Figure 6E ) , indicating the rareness of partial release from non - close - fusion . However , we observed 11 non - close - fusion events that released NPY - EGFP very slowly ( time constant : 6 - 12 s ) ( Figure 6E ) . Thus , the rare partial release seems an extension of very slow release . Furthermore , partial release is consistent with the observation of fusion without releasing vesicular contents ( Taraska et al . , 2003 ) . e5 Cell 173 , 934 – 945 . e1 – e5 , May 3 , 2018 Supplemental Figures Figure S1 .

PoreW H ismeasured asthe full - width - half - maximum of the ﬂuorescence valley across the pore , as labeled . ( E – G ) Similar to panel D , except that the diameter of the U - proﬁle’s pore is 100 nm ( E ) , 75 nm ( F ) , and 0 nm ( G ) . Fluorescence at the pore region and the side ( arrows in panel G ) of the U - proﬁle is higher than that ( triangles in panel G ) at the plasma membrane area away from the U - proﬁle . This is due to a denser membraneareaand thusdenser ﬂuorescentmoleculeswithinourSTED resolution limit ( X : 65nm ; Z : 150nm ) . Notethattheﬂuorescentmoleculenumberperunit membrane area is the same at the U - proﬁle and at the plasma membrane . ( H ) U - proﬁle pore W H plotted versus the pore diameter ( D pore ) . The line has a slope of 1 . W H overestimated the real D pore when the D pore is smaller than the STED resolution , 65 nm . Thus , a measured W H larger than 65 nm should not overestimate the pore diameter . W H is measured from the ﬂuorescence line proﬁle across the pore center , as shown in ( D ) – ( F ) . Conclusion1 : Porediametermeasuredfromthefull - width - half - maximum ( W H ) ofthelineproﬁlefaithfullyrecordstherealporediameterwhentheporediameteris larger than STED resolution ( 65 nm , Figure S1H ) . Since our experimentally measured pore diameter was all larger than 65 nm , the experimentally measured pore diameter should not signiﬁcantly overestimate the real pore size . Conclusion2 : AttheXZplane , despitethesameﬂuorescentmoleculenumberperunitmembraneareaatthe U - proﬁleandtheplasmamembrane , U - proﬁleatthe poreregion neartheplasma membrane oratthesideofthe U - proﬁleisbrighter . Thisisbecausewithinourresolution - limited area ( X : 65nm , Z : 150nm ) , thereare more membrane and thus more ﬂuorescent molecules in areas where the vesicle is attached to the plasma membrane and in about the center of the U - proﬁle membrane , where even the membrane 150 nm south or north in the Z axis direction can contribute to generate ﬂuorescence . Figure S2 . Criteria for Selection of PH G - Labeled U - Proﬁles for Pore Analysis during XZ / Y ﬁx Scanning , Related to Figures 2 and 3 ( A ) Twodepol 1s - inducedPH G - labeled U - proﬁles ( i , ii ) usedforporeanalysis . ThePH G ﬂuoresence ( F PH ) fromthelineacrossthe U - proﬁlecenterisshown . Theline proﬁle in panel i is enlarged , where A 1 is the amplitude of the peak ﬂuorescence of one side of the U - proﬁle membrane , and A 2 is the maximal ﬂuorescence difference between the peak membrane ﬂuorescence and the lowest ﬂuorescence level at the center of the U - proﬁle . The U - proﬁles were used for pore analysis because A 2 / A 1 is larger than 0 . 6 . Weused this criterion to select U - proﬁles for pore analysis . U - proﬁle i and ii were both accepted for pore analysis because their A 2 / A 1 is > 0 . 6 . ( B ) SimilararrangementsasinpanelA , butfortwodepol 1s - inducedPH G - labeled U - proﬁlesnotacceptedforporeanalysis , becauseA 2 / A 1 inF PH lineproﬁleisless than 0 . 6 ( the U - proﬁle is not at the focal plane of the y axis location ) . Criteriausedforselectionof U - proﬁlesforporeanalysisduringXZ / Y ﬁx scanning . IfA 2 / A 1 obtainedfromF PH lineproﬁles , suchasthoseshowninFigureS2A - B , is > 0 . 6 , the U - proﬁle is used for further pore analysis . Otherwise , the U - proﬁle is not at the focal plane and thus is not used for pore analysis . The reason we used this criteria is that XZ / Y stack scanning showed that the U - proﬁles at a y axis location not at the center of the U - proﬁle was blurred with higher ﬂuorecenceatthe U - proﬁlecenterascomparedtothosewiththeyaxislocationacorssthecenterofthe U - proﬁle . Forexample , inFigure1D , theoutlineofPH - U - proﬁles at the y axis of 50 - 150 nm is clearly more blurred as compared to that at the y axis of 250 nm ; consequently , A 2 / A 1 at the y axis of 50 - 150 nm was < 0 . 6 , indicating that the focal plane of these images was not at the U - proﬁle center . Similarly , in Figure 1F , the outline of PH - U - proﬁles at the y axis of 50 - 100 nm is clearlymore blurred ascomparedtothatatthey axisof 200nm ; consequently , A 2 / A 1 atthe yaxisof 50 - 100nm was < 0 . 6 , indicating thatthefocalplane ofthese imageswasnotatthe U - proﬁlecenter .

Ifthepore remains opened , A532ﬂuorescence remains unbleached despite strong excitation ( e . g . , Figures 3A and 3D ) , because bleached A532 continuously exchanged with ﬂuorescent A532 in the bath via the opened pore .

Thedatawereﬁtwithalinearregression linewithacorrelationcoefﬁcientof0 . 08 ; p = 0 . 71fortheANOVAtestofthelinearregression ﬁt , indicating no apparent correlation between the rate of constriction and expansion . The mean expansion rate was calculated as the maximal Pore v divided the time needed from fusion to the maximal Pore v . The mean constriction rate was calculated as the maximal Pore v divided by the time needed to constrict to Pore noV . These calculations reﬂected the mean rate , which is different from the maximal expansion rate or constriction rate at any given time point shown in Figures 3A and 3C .

Data collected at 300 ms / frame were not used . For data collected at 26 and 46 ms / frame , if the constriction or expansion rate is faster than 26 and 46 ms / frame , we divided the rate by 4 and by 2 , respectively , to mimic the rates measured at 100 ms / frame . This explains in part why the rate of constriction and expansion shown here was smaller than those shown in Figures 3A and 3C . The data did not include Pore v of U - proﬁles that shrank subsequently after fusion , because shrinking obscured detection of Pore v . Figure S5 .
