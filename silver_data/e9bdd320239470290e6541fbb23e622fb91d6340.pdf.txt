A FIJI macro automatically generated 11 lines perpendicular to the filopodia / protrusion and an intensity profile was plotted for each .

For double Gaussian fitting the width of the filopodia / protrusion was measured as the distance between the two outer FWHM points ( i . e . furthest left to furthest right ; + to + ) , whereas for single Gaussian it was simply the FWHM ( + to + ) .

The FRAP recovery curve was calculated for each IRSp53 sample and then averaged across ( n = 11 ) samples to produce the black curve . Error bars denote standard error . The red curve shows the fitted curve using maximum likelihood estimates from the 2 - pool model ( A ) and 4 - pool model ( C ) . ( B ) and ( D ) show the region demarcated by blue box in ( A ) and ( C ) respectively . The R 2 value was obtained by comparing the FRAP recovery curve and the fitted curve between 6 to 16 seconds . From the FRAP recovery curves in ( B ) and ( D ) , we can tell that the 2 - pool model does not fit well and exhibit underfitting especially at the initial stages following photobleaching . Thus , the 4 - pool model is more apt to explain the dynamics of IRSp53 protein . Figure S7 Supplementary movie S1 .
