Disorders arising from mutations on the X chromosome are typically characterized by affected males and unaffected carrier females . In contrast , EFMR spares transmitting males and affects only carrier females . Aided by systematic resequencing of 737 X chromosome genes , we identiﬁed different protocadherin 19 ( PCDH19 ) gene mutations in seven families with EFMR . Five mutations resulted in the introduction of a premature termination codon . Study of two of these demonstrated nonsense - mediated decay of PCDH19 mRNA . The two missense mutations were predicted to affect adhesiveness of PCDH19 through impaired calcium binding . PCDH19 is expressed in developing brains of human and mouse and is the ﬁrst member of the cadherin superfamily to be directly implicated in epilepsy or mental retardation . EFMR ( MIM 300088 ) is a condition characterized by seizure onset in infancy or early childhood ( 6 – 36 months ) and cognitive impairment . The disorder is sex - limited , with the phenotype being restricted to females . Males are apparently spared , with normal cognitive function and absence of seizures . Evidence for the trait being due to a gene on the X chromosome derives from the pattern of inheritance and from genetic linkage to Xq22 ( ref . 1 ) . EFMR is recognizable in multi - generational pedigrees by the unique sex - limited expression pattern , wherein affected females are connected through unaffected trans - mitting males 1 – 3 . We ascertained ﬁve new families carrying EFMR on the basis of their inheritance pattern , electroclinical features and gene localization to Xq22 ( ref . 4 and S . M . , unpublished data ) . To identify the under - lying genetic defect , we resequenced 737 genes from the Vertebrate Genome Annotation ( VEGA ) database in probands from three families . We identiﬁed a single nonsense nucleotide change 2012C 4 G ( S671X ) in the PCDH19 gene in family 3 ( Fig . 1 ) . Families 1 and 2 initially did not show any changes . Subsequent comparative sequence analysis of the annotated PCDH19 ORF revealed that it was incomplete , consistent with a previous report 5 . We annotated the complete 3 , 447 - bp ORF of PCDH19 , which consists of six exons . The full - length , processed PCDH19 mRNA is 9 , 765 nt long , with exon 2 alternatively spliced Received 5 October 2007 ; accepted 11 March 2008 ; published online 11 May 2008 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / ng . 149 1 Department of Genetic Medicine , Level 9 Rieger Building , Women’s and Children’s Hospital , 72 King William Road , North Adelaide , South Australia 5006 , Australia . 2 School of Paediatrics and Reproductive Health , University of Adelaide , Adelaide , South Australia 5005 , Australia . 3 Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , Wellcome Trust Genome Campus , Hinxton , Cambridge CB10 1SA , UK . 4 School of Molecular & Biomedical Science , University of Adelaide , Adelaide , South Australia 5005 , Australia . 5 Epilepsy Research Centre and Department of Medicine , University of Melbourne , Level 1 Neurosciences Building , Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital , Austin Health , Banksia Street , Heidelberg West , Victoria 3081 , Australia . 6 Department of Paediatrics , University of Melbourne , Royal Children’s Hospital , Flemington Road , Parkville , Victoria 3052 , Australia . 7 Program in Neurogenetics and Neurobehavioral Genetics , Neurology Department and Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Behavior , David Geffen School of Medicine , University of California at Los Angeles , Los Angeles , California 90095 - 1769 , USA . 8 Molecular Neurogenetics Unit , Center for Human Genetic Research , Massachusetts General Hospital , 185 Cambridge Street , Boston , Massachusetts 02114 , USA and Department of Genetics , Harvard Medical School , 77 Avenue Louis Pasteur , NRB 0330 , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 , USA . 9 Department of Neurology , Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center , 6 Weizmann Street , Tel Aviv 64239 , Israel . 10 Department of Neurology , Schneider Children’s Medical Center , Petaq Tikvah 49202 , Israel . 11 Metabolic Neurogenetic Clinic , Wolfson Medical Center , 62 HaLohamim Street , Holon 58100 , Israel . 12 AstraZeneca , 1800 Concord Pike , Wilmington , Delaware 19803 , USA . 13 Northern Ireland Regional Genetics Service , Belfast City Hospital , Lisburn Road , Belfast BT9 7AB , Northern Ireland , UK . 14 These authors contributed equally to this work .

Sequencing of the entire PCDH19 ORF identiﬁed a missense change 1322T 4 A ( V441E ) in family 1 , a nonsense change 253C 4 T ( Q85X ) in family 2 , a frameshift change 2030 _ 2031 insT ( L677fsX717 ) in family 4 and a frameshift change 357delC ( I119fsX122 ) in family 5 . Finally , we identiﬁed a frameshift change 1091 _ 1092insC ( P364fsX375 ) in the original EFMR - bearing family ( family 6 , ref . 1 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . In summary , we identiﬁed PCDH19 nucleotide changes in all six families bearing EFMR that we studied . Another unique nucleotide change ( 1671C 4 G , N557K ) was identiﬁed by screening a cohort of 87 females that included both isolated and familial cases with epilepsy and varying degrees of mental impairment . We found that the nucleotide change in this small family , with two affected girls with epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder , arose de novo in their carrier father on the grandmaternal X chromosome ( Fig . 1 , family 7 ) . All seven nucleotide changes ( Fig . 2a ) segregated with the clinical phenotype in the respective families ( Fig . 1 ) and were not present in 250 male probands from families with putative X - linked mental retardation or in 750 control ( 350 male and 400 female ) X chromo - somes . Further , we did not detect any other potentially deleterious nucleotide changes in probands from the three families in any of the other 736 X - chromosome genes sequenced ( data not shown ) . Taken together , the predicted loss of function of all seven PCDH19 changes ( see below ) , the high degree of conservation of the residues affected by the two missense changes ( Fig . 2a , b ) and our PCDH19 mRNA studies ( see below ) strongly support PCDH19 as the gene whose mutation causes EFMR . Moreover , PCDH19 is located at Xq22 ( Ensembl database ) within the original linkage region 1 . EFMR locus homo - geneity in these families has now been molecularly deﬁned , and the combined lod score with markers in the Xq22 region reached 11 . 9 ( refs . 1 , 4 and S . M . , unpublished data ) . Among the seven families bearing EFMR studied , there were two ( of 68 ) carrier females who had been classiﬁed ( at the time of the original assessment ) as unaffected . Therefore , the estimated penetrance of the known EFMR mutations in females was 4 90 % . PCDH19 was expressed predominantly in neural tissues and at different developmental stages . By RNA blot analysis using a PCDH19 - speciﬁc probe , we detected a transcript size of approximately 9 . 8 kb from various areas of the male and female adult human brain ( Fig . 2c and below ) . We also identiﬁed PCDH19 mRNA expression in primary skin ﬁbroblasts . This allowed us to examine the consequences of the PCDH19 mutations 253C 4 T , Q85X ( family 2 ) and 2012C 4 G , S671X ( family 3 ) on the stability of their respective mRNAs . Both mutations introduce a premature termination codon ( PTC ) into the PCDH19 mRNA . Such PTC - containing mRNAs are usually recognized by the nonsense - mediated decay ( NMD ) surveillance complexes and Family 1 1322T > A V441E Family 4 2030 _ 2031insT L677fsX717 Family 6 1091 _ 1092insC P364fsX375 Family 2 253C > T Q85X Family 5 357delCl119fsX122 Family 7 1671C > G N557K Family 3 2012C > G S671X 190 2 160 2 200 290 300 130 140 2 2 3 60 70 5 2 2 2 2 3 380 390 300 310 4 9 8 5 4 4 2 5 3 3 3 3 11 6 6 18 8 7 150 4 2 2 8 EFMR EFMR carrier Miscarriage Figure 1 Mutations in PCDH19 cause EFMR .

We found that the PTC mutations in family 2 ( Fig . 2d ) and family 3 ( data not shown ) led to PCDH19 mRNA degradation by NMD . Inhibition of translation by cycloheximide treatment of skin ﬁbroblast cells preserved the PTC mutation – containing mRNA ( Fig . 2d ) . The absence of mutant PCDH19 mRNAs could not be attributed to skewing of X - inactivation . We conﬁrmed random X - inactivation in DNA isolated from blood and skin ﬁbroblast cultures of each affected female available ( data not shown ) , in agreement with previous data 1 . PCDH19 encodes a 1 , 148 – amino acid protein belonging to the protocadherin d 2 subclass of the cadherin superfamily of cell - cell adhesion molecules . PCDH19 contains a signal sequence , six extra - cellular cadherin ( EC ) repeats , a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic region with conserved CM1 and CM2 domains ( Fig . 2a ) . The biological role of the PCDH19 protein is not known . However , members of the protocadherin family are predomi - nantly expressed in the nervous system 7 , 8 and are postulated to be involved in the establishment of neuronal connections and in signal transduction at the synaptic membrane 9 , 10 . PCDH10 , also a d 2 protocadherin , is required for growth of striatal axons and thala - mocortical projections 11 . Usher syndrome type 1 , involving combined hearing loss and blindness , was the ﬁrst human disorder to be associated with mutations in a PCDH gene ( PCDH15 ) 12 . Mutations in PCDH19 have now been associated with epilepsy and mental retardation . All mutations identiﬁed in this study were located in the large PCDH19 extracellular domain ( Fig . 2a ) containing the cadherin repeats , which facilitate cell - cell interactions . We predict ﬁve of these mutations to be complete loss - of - function mutations as a consequence of NMD degradation of their respective PTC - containing mRNAs ( Fig . 2d and data not shown ) . Given the similarity among the clinical phenotypes associated with all seven PCDH19 mutations , it is reason - able to suggest that the remaining two mutations , missense mutations leading to V441E and N557K substitutions , also lead to loss of PCDH19 function . The N557K mutation affects an invariant aspar - agine residue within the EC5 domain ( Fig . 2a , b ) . The equivalent asparagine residue of EC1 of classical cadherins ( for example , Asn100 of N - cadherin 13 ) and protocadherins ( for example , Asn101 of Pcdh a 14 ) is essential for calcium binding and thus for the adhesive function of the EC1 domain 13 , 14 . The valine residue at position 441 ( in EC4 , or the equivalent of Val96 in EC1 of N - cadherin 13 or Val97 in EC1 of Pcdh a 14 ) is also highly conserved ( Fig . 2b ) and in close proximity to the calcium - binding site 13 , 14 . We speculate that both PCDH19 missense variants adversely affect PCDH19 adhesive func - tion through impaired calcium binding . To investigate the expression of PCDH19 in the developing mouse and human central nervous system ( CNS ) , we performed in situ hybridization analysis . In mice , Pcdh19 had widespread expression in both the embryonic and adult brain , including the developing cortex and hippocampus ( Fig . 3 and Supplementary Note online ) , which is Family 5 l119fsX122 Family 2 Q85X EC1 EC2 EC3 EC4 EC5 EC6 TM E2 CM1 CM2 Family 7 N557K Family 4 L677fsX717 Family 6 P364fsX375 Family 1 V441E Family 3 S671X δ 2 PCDHs δ 1 PCDHs δ 2 PCDHs δ 1 PCDHs 1 23 129 238 [ kb ] C e r ebe ll u m C e r eb r a l c o r t e x M edu ll a S p i na l c o r d O cc i p i t a l po l e F r on t a l l obe T e m po r a l l obe P u t a m en A m y gda l a C auda t e nu c l eu s C o r pu s c a ll o s u m H i ppo c a m pu s B r a i n ( w ho l e ) T ha l a m u s 9 . 5 7 . 5 4 . 4 9 . 5 7 . 5 9 . 5 7 . 5 346 453 563 678 705 716 763 901 936 956 972 1448 * * PCDH19 V441E Ca 2 + binding site Ca 2 + binding site Q85X Fibroblast gDNA Fibroblast cDNA Fibroblast cDNA after cycloheximide treatment N557K PCDH17PCDH10PCDH18PCDH8 PCDH19PCDH17PCDH10PCDH18PCDH8 PCDH9PCDH7PCDH alpha 4 PCDH gamma B4 PCDH beta 15 Mouse PCDH19 Dog PCDH19 Chicken PCDH19 Zebrafish PCDH19 PCDH19 PCDH11X / Y PCDH9PCDH7PCDH alpha 4 PCDH gamma B4 PCDH beta 15 Mouse PCDH19 Dog PCDH19 Chicken PCDH19 Zebrafish PCDH19 [ kb ] 9 . 5 7 . 5 4 . 4 a b c d Figure 2 Structure and expression analysis of PCDH19 .

In human tissue , in addition to PCDH19 , we also investigated the expression pattern of PCDH11X and PCDH11Y , two paralogous protocadherin genes , whose expression and function we speculate to be relevant to EFMR ( see Fig . 4 and below ) . Each of the three PCDH genes was expressed in developing cortical plate , amygdala and subcortical regions and in the ganglionic eminence ( Fig . 4 ) . However , PCDH11X / Y expression showed a marked sexual dimorphism in the caudate nucleus : virtually absent expression in the male and high expression in the female ( Fig . 4a – c ) . Additionally , closer inspection of the amygdala showed that PCDH19 was expressed in lateral nuclei , whereas PCDH11X / Y was more medial . Typically , in most X - linked dominant conditions , males are more severely affected and often die prenatally . In EFMR , the transmitting males are apparently normal ( that is , without epilepsy or intellectual disability ) , but with some obsessive traits reported anecdotally 4 . Previous hypotheses to explain the EFMR expression pattern 1 con - sidered either a dominant negative effect of the mutant protein in carrier females ( for example , similar to that of the C - terminally truncated P - cadherin in malignant melanoma 15 ) or the presence of a compensatory or rescue factor in males . The dominant negative effect of mutant PCDH19 is unlikely , based on our NMD results ( see above ) , and PCDH19 does not have a Y - chromosome paralog to provide male rescue . Sexually dimorphic expression and function 16 , 17 of PCDH19 and / or relevant compensatory genes is also a possibility . We propose an alternative hypothesis , based on the identity of the EFMR gene , that invokes functional rescue by a related , but nonparalogous , protocadherin gene in males . The PCDH19 gene is subject to X inactivation ( Supplementary Figs . 2 and 3 online ) . Therefore , hemizygous transmitting males will have a homogeneous population of PCDH19 - negative cells , whereas affected females are likely to be mosaics comprising PCDH19 - negative and PCDH19 – wild type cells . Such tissue mosaicism may scramble cell - cell communication , which manifests clinically as EFMR . A similar mechanism was proposed for the craniofrontonasal syn - drome CFNS ( MIM 304110 ) 18 . We hypothesize that the absence of PCDH19 function in males may potentially be compensated for by the related but nonparalogous protocadherin gene PCDH11Y , a Y - chro - mosome gene that is expressed in human brain 19 , 20 . PCDH11Y has an X chromosome paralog , PCDH11X , that has strong sequence similar - ity 19 . However , the differences in brain expression patterns between these two genes may account for differential ability to compensate for absence of PCDH19 . The potential role of PCDH11Y ( and that of its paralog PCDH11X ) in the EFMR phenotype will need to be addressed in the future by engineering the appropriate animal models . Cadherins are a large family of genes with crucial functions in human brain 21 . Our data directly implicate the protocadherin gene family in epilepsy and intellectual disability . On the basis of our observations , molecular diagnosis will result in wider recognition of EFMR , especially in smaller families and single cases , with important consequences for counseling .

The clinical details of families 1 – 4 have been reported 4 . The proband in family 5 ( IV . 2 ) experienced multiple seizures in the ﬁrst year of life and has severe learning disabilities , no speech , and behavioral disturbances ( S .

Family 7 was ascertained on the basis of one sister having infantile seizures and Asperger’s syndrome and the other having epilepsy and mild intellectual disability ( I . E . S . and S . F .

Human brain MTN blots II and V ( Clontech ) were hybridized per the manufacturer’s instructions with a probe containing nucleotides 2884 – 3257 of the human PCDH19 ORF . The 374 - bp PCR product ( see Supplemen - tary Table 1 online for PCR primer sequences ) was labeled with radio - active [ 32 P ] dCTP ( Perkin Elmer ) using the Megaprime DNA labeling system ( GE Healthcare ) . RT - PCR analyses . Total RNA was extracted from ﬁbroblast cells with the RNeasy Mini kit ( Qiagen ) and treated with DNase I ( Qiagen ) . About 2 m g of RNAwas primed with 1 m g of random hexanucleotides and subjected to reverse transcription for 90 min at 42 1 C using Superscript II ( Invitrogen ) . The efﬁciency of the reaction was tested by PCR using primers speciﬁc to the ubiquitously expressed ESD gene . cDNAs were ampliﬁed with Taq DNA polymerase ( Roche ) and speciﬁc single - stranded DNA primers for 35 cycles ( denaturation , 94 1 C for 30 s ; annealing , at speciﬁc melting temperature for each pair of primers for 30 s ; extension , 72 1 C for 30 s ) . PCR products were separated on an agarose gel stained with 1 % ethidium bromide . Tissue culture of primary skin ﬁbroblast lines . A 3 - mm skin biopsy excised from the upper arm was cut ﬁnely and transferred to a tissue culture ﬂask . The biopsy was cultured in RPMI - 1640 , 20 % FCS ( supplemented with 4 mM L - glutamine , 0 . 017 mg / ml benzylpenicillin ) and grown at 37 1 C , with 5 % CO 2 . Once established , ﬁbroblasts were cultured in RPMI - 1640 , 10 % FCS ( supplements as above ) . Cycloheximide treatment of skin ﬁbroblast cell lines . Primary ﬁbroblast cells were seeded at 1 (cid:1) 10 4 per cm 2 in RPMI - 1640 , 10 % FCS , and incubated with 50 m g / ml cycloheximide ( Sigma ) or medium alone for 6 h . Fibroblasts were harvested using a sterile cell scraper ( TPP ) , then washed once in PBS before total RNA extraction and processing to cDNA as described above .

Human tissue was obtained from the Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders at the University of Maryland and was treated as previously described 22 . Five brains were used , ranging in gestational age from 16 to 20 weeks , with known post mortem intervals from 1 to 2 h . For probe preparation , we performed cDNA synthesis using Superscript III ( Invitrogen ) from RNA of the inferior frontal gyrus of a 20 - gestational - week fetus ( RNeasy Mini kit , Qiagen ) and ampliﬁed two nonoverlapping cDNA transcripts for both PCDH11X / Y and PCDH19 using Platinum Taq Polymerase ( Qiagen ) . Two probes for PCDH11X / Y were designed to recognize all PCDH11X and PCDH11Y isoforms . The PCR primer sequences used for generating the two probes and the PCDH19 probe are provided in Supplementary Table 1 . In situ hybridization and image analysis were performed as previously described 22 . Nonoverlapping probe sets for both genes conﬁrmed the same expression pattern .
