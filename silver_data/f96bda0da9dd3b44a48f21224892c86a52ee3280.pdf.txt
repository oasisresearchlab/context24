As the virus spreads through human society , the social networks of conﬁrmed cases can provide us with crucial new insights on this question . Methods : Based on the epidemiological reports of 235 COVID - 19 cases in Nanjing , we constructed a social contact network for the epidemic . By analyzing the structure of this network , we explored the transmission characteristics of the epidemic , to provide evidence - based explanations for its transmission . Results : In our constructed transmission network , more than half ( 95 / 165 , 57 . 58 % ) of patients were found not to have transmitted the infection , with only 15 ( 9 . 10 % ) source patients accounting for more than a third of the contagion ( 60 , 36 . 36 % ) , suggesting that the transmission of COVID - 19 varies per individuals . Patients in the 31 to 50 age group were the main source of infectious clusters , with females playing a more active role in passing on the infection . Network component analysis identiﬁed nine components with disproportionate concentrations of inﬂuential patients , accounting for 49 . 09 % ( 81 ) of the patients and 59 . 09 % ( 78 ) of epidemiological network contacts . Family aggregation may favor disease transmission , and parenthood is the relationship with the highest infection risk within the family cluster . In addition , some speciﬁc public places , such as chess and card parlors , were found to be notable hotspots for community infection . Conclusion : This study presents the evolution of the urban epidemic from the perspective of individual - level and socially interactive processes . This real - world evidence can help to increase public awareness of the epidemic , formulate countermeasures , and allocate limited public health resources for urban management . Keywords : COVID - 19 , social network , contact tracing data , urban epidemic , Nanjing INTRODUCTION Even though Chinese authorities never let their guard down since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) crisis and the current prevention and control measures are implemented soundly in China , the resurgence of the epidemic has been noted in various cities across the country . Therefore , it is important to understand the evolution of the epidemic in a city if we are to mitigate its risk . On this issue , the social and urban fundamental principles of the transmission of Wang et al . COVID - 19 Epidemic Embedded Social Network COVID - 19 deserve our attention ( 1 ) . In the case of such infectious diseases , the virus is transmitted among people through their social contacts ( 2 ) . From this perspective , the evolution of an urban epidemic can be seen to be the same as the formation of social contact networks among those with the virus . In this way , analyzing the social contact networks of conﬁrmed cases helps to identify the transmission characteristics of COVID - 19 in cities ; this is of vital importance in formulating countermeasures and in allocating limited public health resources for urban management ( 3 ) . Since the outbreak of COVID - 19 , many mathematical models of disease transmission have been used to predict the evolution of urban epidemics and to design interventions ; these have included regression models , Susceptible - Infected - Recovered ( SIR ) models , and their evolutionary branch models ( 4 – 6 ) . Furthermore , other variables were added to expand the explanatory scope of these models . For instance , to counter the wide dissemination of false information related to the epidemic , researchers appends individual communicating willingness and forgetting eﬀects to the Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Recovered ( SEIR ) model to study the mechanisms by which public opinion is formed , disseminated , and polarized ( 7 ) . In addition , many advanced statistical techniques , such as Bayesian analysis , have been used in the study of epidemics ( 8 ) . The use of multiple models enriches the research in this ﬁeld . However , the above studies mostly focus on either predicting or retroﬁtting the epidemic situation , while failing to show the dynamics of disease transmission from the perspective of individual level ( 9 ) . For this reason , prediction results using mathematical modeling can sometimes be very diﬀerent from the actual numbers that are subsequently reported ( 10 , 11 ) . Therefore , exploration of the microscopic spread mechanisms of viruses is urgently needed . Understanding the changes in the network itself and the role of human adaptive behavior in the process of disease transmission can provide eﬀective insight into the spread of viruses in a real - life network ( 12 ) . Previous studies of the epidemic pattern of infectious diseases , considering the contact network have demonstrated the potential of social network analysis in explaining the real - world phenomena . For example , using dynamic bipartite graphs to simulate smallpox outbreaks in urban social networks , Eubank et al . found that these outbreaks can be contained by a strategy of targeted vaccination combined with early detection without resorting to mass vaccination of the population ( 13 ) . Block et al . adopted a social network approach to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of distancing strategies designed by network topology to demonstrate that a strategic reduction of contact through social networks strongly enhances the eﬀectiveness of social distancing measures while keeping risks low ( 14 ) . A consideration of the heterogeneity of contact patterns in epidemics by Li et al . used a contact network model to more realistically simulate two stages of the COVID - 19 outbreak on the “Diamond Princess” cruise ship ( 15 ) . All the studies above used diﬀerent contact network models to explain the outbreak more accurately , however , the network models used in these studies are generally based on theory or simulation and lack disease transmission data from the real world . To understand the evolution , prevention , and control of the epidemic , it is vital to analyze the spatial and temporal co - occurrence of conﬁrmed cases ( 9 ) . The support of real - world disease transmission data ensures the accuracy and eﬃcacy of non - pharmacological interventions ( 12 ) . In addition to macro - level prevention and control measures , it is also important to provide guidance and regulation on individual behavior , which requires information on the spread of infection through social contact ( 9 ) . Encouragingly , the spatiotemporal information contained in daily case reports , including the relationship between diﬀerent cases and their movement trajectories , provides an important source of real - world data on the evolution of urban epidemics at the individual level ( 16 ) . For COVID - 19 , some researchers have used real - world case data to conduct studies of contact networks . By analyzing empirical , interpersonal , and physical contact networks using mobile device data in the city of Portland , Oregon , the impact of these diﬀerent network topologies on the spread of COVID - 19 was identiﬁed ( 17 ) . Using contact tracing information of 135 and 143 conﬁrmed patients with COVID - 19 in Tianjin and Chengdu , respectively , from January 21 to February 22 , 2020 , researchers were able to trace the transmission source and contacts , assess the current situation of transmission and prevention and provide evidence for the response and control of the COVID - 19 epidemic in other regions in the world ( 3 ) . These studies deepen our understanding of epidemic transmission and help us to formulate targeted measures based on scientiﬁc analysis of transmission networks . This study collected all conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases published in Nanjing , China , from July 20 to August 26 , 2021 , a total of 235 cases . By constructing the social contact networks of these cases based on their records , this paper explores the structural characteristics of the COVID - 19 transmission network . We attempt to explain these characteristics using factual evidence to provide a scientiﬁc basis for increasing public awareness and formulating prevention and control measures . METHODS Data Source On July 20 , 2021 , a new local wave of COVID - 19 was identiﬁed in Nanjing , which spread to more than 20 cities in Beijing , Hunan , Anhui , Liaoning , and other provinces . Previously , there had been no local cases of COVID - 19 in the city for more than a year . Investigations revealed that the source of the virus was an inbound ﬂight from Russia ; a cleaner was infected , which subsequently resulted in community transmission in the city . The speciﬁc and unique primary patient clariﬁes the evolution of the epidemic in this case . Since August 26 , Nanjing has reported 235 cases of COVID - 19 . However , there were no new conﬁrmed cases for the 2 weeks from August 13 to 26 . For this reason , we believe that this wave of the epidemic was a complete transmission event involving the whole process of emergence , development , and extinction . This event is a perfect candidate from which to gain relevant empirical evidence on urban epidemic evolution . Nanjing is the epicenter of this outbreak , and the epidemiological investigation reports were quickly communicated by the Nanjing Health Commission .

All the samples in this study are collected from the oﬃcial websites of the Nanjing Health Commission from July 20 to August 26 , 2021 . Structured information about the samples is available in the Supplementary Materials section . Study Design First , we extracted relevant demographic and spatiotemporal information from individual records in the reports published by the city’s oﬃcial health committee to build a structured dataset that included sex , age , household location , occupation , activity tracking , the relationship between cases , and time of deﬁnite diagnosis . Second , we constructed the transmission network using the following two steps . First , each patient was represented as a node , with their medical record number provided by the daily bulletins used as a unique identiﬁcation number . Then , the epidemiological contacts among cases were identiﬁed and represented as directional edges emanating from a “source patient” to a “target patient” to link those nodes . Based on the information about household location , place of employment , activity track , and social relationship , we determined the spatial and temporal co - occurrence of conﬁrmed cases , which suggested the existence of the epidemiological contacts among them . In this way , we hypothesized that the ﬁrst conﬁrmed cases are the source of infection for their spatial and temporal co - occurrence persons . Cases without a clear exposure history were scattered outside the transmission network and were not part of it . Third , we visualized and analyzed the constructed network . We imported the adjacency matrix of the network into Gephi software ( Version 0 . 9 . 2 ) ; the Force atlas layout and Fruchterman Reingold layout in Gephi software were applied to visualize the transmission network . We analyzed the network attributes generated by Gephi using MS Excel to explain the transmission characteristics of the infection network in the context of known facts . Then , the social relationships among cases were embedded in the network to provide further insight on infection spread . Measures We performed a conventional demographic analysis of the study data that were also the basis of our network research . Then , we analyzed the transmission network in three ways : whole network , nodes and components , and social relations . Some studies have shown that network attributes are closely related to the spread of COVID - 19 in the network ( 18 , 19 ) . Insight into social relationships among conﬁrmed cases could help identify the high - risk Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 3 June 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 879340 Wang et al .

COVID - 19 Epidemic Embedded Social Network TABLE 2 | The calculation result of whole network measures . Measure Result Number of nodes 165 Number of edges 132 Network density 0 . 005 Mean path length 1 . 600 RESULTS Demography As shown in Figure 1 , 47 new conﬁrmed cases were reported on July 27 , the highest daily total since July 20 . The number of new daily cases decreased and did not exceed two after August 5 . No new cases were reported from August 13 and the total number of conﬁrmed cases stabilized at 235 . Figure 2 shows the age and gender distribution of the study data . Of the total 235 conﬁrmed cases , 95 ( 40 . 43 % ) were male and 140 ( 59 . 57 % ) were female . They ranged in age from 4 months to 87 years , with an average age of 43 . 12 years . Most cases ( 71 / 235 ; 30 . 21 % ) were found in the 41 – 50 age range . The number of female cases in this age group was signiﬁcantly larger than that of male cases , while there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in other age groups . Whole Network In our constructed transmission network , there were 165 ( 70 . 21 % ) nodes related to 165 conﬁrmed cases with epidemiological contact with others . The remaining 70 ( 29 . 79 % ) nodes were isolated patients without clear epidemiological contact information . The number of network edges was 132 , that was , 132 pairs of contact relationships existed between 165 patients . Our network density was measured as 0 . 005 and the mean path length between the patients was 1 . 600 ( Table 2 ) . Nodes and Components Table 3 shows the summary statistics of node attributes . There were 95 ( 57 . 58 % ) nodes with zero outdegrees , which means that these 95 patients did not infect other people . Of those remaining , 70 ( 42 . 42 % ) nodes had an outdegree range of 1 ∼ 7 and were the source of infection to 132 ( 80 % ) targets . Among these source patients , 15 individuals had infected more than two people , and these collectively led to 36 . 36 % of all secondary infections in the network . There were 40 ( 24 . 24 % ) patients with an indegree centrality measure of zero , therefore , having no epidemiological contact with a source patient . The number of patients who had an indegree of one respectively corresponding to a source patient was 121 ( 73 . 33 % ) . The remaining four ( 2 . 42 % ) patients had an indegree of more than one , implying multiple sources were identiﬁed for each of them . Most contagions occurring in this epidemic round were one on one . The range of betweenness was 1 ∼ 26 for 25 ( 15 . 15 % ) patients , and they played a bridging role in the transmission of infection . Disproportionately , 140 ( 84 . 85 % ) patients with zero betweenness centrality did not bridge the transmission . As shown in Table 4 , women had a higher mean outdegree and a higher betweenness than men ( 0 . 990 vs . 0 . 529 , 1 . 113 vs . 0 . 265 respectively ) . Patients ranging in age from 31 to 50 also had a higher outdegree , indicating that this age group was the main factor causing the seeding of clusters . Most of the age group had a high value of betweenness centrality . However , it was relatively low in the 41 to 50 age group , which means that people in this age group seldom serve as a bridge of infectious transmission . It is interesting to note that all patients older than 70 years had zero outdegrees and betweenness ; therefore , they did not infect other people in this outbreak . The aggregate network consisted of 39 components , most of which occurred between July 25 to 28 ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . The peak production of the components took place on July 26 . Components were not occurring consecutively , rather , they were mostly simultaneous over time . Of these 39 components , nine components , each consisting of six or more nodes , accounted for 49 . 09 % ( 81 ) of patients and 59 . 09 % ( 78 ) of epidemiological contacts in the network . All patients who had higher outdegree and betweenness centrality measures ( ranking 97 . 5 or more ) featured disproportionately in the nine components . The identiﬁed network component structure highlights that not all infections were directly transmitted from the primary patients to many target patients , but predominantly through inﬂuential patients with high outdegree or betweenness who transmitted the infection from them ( Table 5 ) . Social Relations Figure 3 shows the embedded social relations of the dynamic contact network . Three time points were identiﬁed to represent the network structure : the early period ( July 24 ) , the outbreak period ( July 27 ) , and the epilog period ( August 12 ) . The early period network was loose , with the spread of infection mainly due to family contact . During the outbreak period , community transmission increased , and several clusters appeared . In the epilog period , clusters continued to develop based on those formed in the previous stage , with few new large clusters developing , which indicates that the control measures taken were eﬀective . Infection through contact between colleagues or friends was found to be more frequent than in the initial two stages of the epidemic . As shown in Figure 4 , of the 165 patients in the transmission network , 56 ( 33 . 94 % ) patients were infected through family clusters , involving 37 households . In Figure 3 , these patients form a cluster of three or more nodes , showing the clustering characteristics of a “small world” ( 20 ) . In a family cluster , parentage is the relationship with the highest infection risk , as 58 . 93 % of contagions occurred between parents and children . By contrast , only 17 . 86 % of contagion was transmitted between couples . A total of 52 ( 31 . 52 % ) patients were infected through community living . Most cases were caused by contact with Lukou airport employees in the community , including talking with neighbors , shopping at supermarkets , and playing mahjong . Furthermore , some speciﬁc public places deserve our attention , especially chess and card parlors , which became hotspots for Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 5 June 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 879340 Wang et al .

A quarter of patients infected in the community were exposed through playing mahjong . Only 16 ( 9 . 70 % ) cases were infected by colleagues or friends . About 41 ( 24 . 85 % ) patients had unclear infection pathways because their records did not provide enough information to trace the full transmission chains . DISCUSSION Demographic data show that most COVID - 19 cases in Nanjing were middle - aged and female . The number of female cases was signiﬁcantly larger than that of males in the 41 to 50 age group , while there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in other age groups . The hotspot population of this outbreak was the cleaning staﬀ at Nanjing Lukou Airport who were mostly females aged between 41 to 50 , which may account for the diﬀerences described above in age and gender distribution . The network density was very low at only 0 . 005 , indicating that the transmission network was loosely connected . In this case , each edge is closely related to the connectivity of the network , and cutting oﬀ some connections may break the network up into several isolated sub - networks . The low network density provides hard evidence of the reliability of social distancing . From this , avoiding unnecessary social contact during an epidemic will help to limit the spread of the virus to a small group of people . A calculation of mean path length indicated that on average any source and target patients in the network could be reached by crossing 1 . 6 steps . This suggests that the transmission of infection is limited to less than two steps on average . From a social network perspective , the dynamics of the infection transmission are closely related to the concept of path lengths , which indicates the number of network steps needed to connect two nodes . A short mean path length will facilitate the spread of the virus on the network . Consequently , one aim of social distancing should be increasing the average network distance between individuals by smartly and strategically manipulating the structure of interactions ( besides the general reduction of contact ) ( 14 ) . The fact that while more than half ( 95 , 57 . 58 % ) of the patients did not transmit infection , only 15 ( 9 . 10 % ) source patients , accounted for more than a third of contagion ( 60 , 36 . 36 % ) , suggests an individual - level variation in the transmission of COVID - 19 . A study found that the estimate of the degree of heterogeneity can be biased downward by small sample size or under - reporting of zero - class events but are not biased upward by any of the factors considered ( 21 ) . From this , the actual result might be more disproportionate than it is now since many patients were excluded from the network . Similar transmission patterns are reported in other areas in China , such as Shenzhen where 8 . 9 % of the cases caused 80 % of all infections and Hunan where 80 % of secondary infections were traced back to 15 % of primary infections ( 22 , 23 ) . The similarity in these results suggests that our ﬁndings may apply universally within the population . The individual - level variation in the transmission of COVID - 19 indicated by our network analysis methods serves as a reminder to Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 6 June 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 879340 Wang et al .

Except for the minority of inﬂuential source patients such as super - spreaders , bridging patients who transmitted the infection from these inﬂuential source patients were crucial in the development of a transmission network , for example , patient 30 ( P30 ) with a high betweenness centrality measure of 26 . Figure 5 shows the transmission chain involving P30 ; she was infected by her daughter - in - law ( P28 ) who had been in contact at a gym with a cleaner at Nanjing Lukou Airport and subsequently transmitted infection to six other individuals at a chess and card parlor . P83 , one of the six target patients , then transmitted the infection directly or indirectly to six other Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 9 June 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 879340 Wang et al . COVID - 19 Epidemic Embedded Social Network individuals . In this transmission chain , P30 acted as a bridge to diﬀuse the virus from the source to the city community and was responsible for 12 secondary infections . Even though susceptible people may never have had contact with primary patients , they could establish connections with them through these inﬂuential bridging patients and unwittingly become a similar transmission bridge to spread the virus . These actors may not spread the infection to many contacts , but their bridging characteristic accelerates transmission in the community ( 24 ) . This is particularly the case for cross - community bridges , for example , taxi or ride - hailing drivers who travel around the city . To reduce the transmission eﬃciency of the virus around the network , we should not only contain the source but also focus on bridges on the critical transmission path . In our study , patients in the 31 to 50 age group were the main force behind seeding the clusters , with females playing a more active role in bridging the infection , possibly reﬂecting the close community ties between them . Public health authorities could prioritize both these individuals and the clusters for rigorous containment and adopt control measures to the transmission characteristics of speciﬁc actors . Further study is required to determine what social and behavioral characteristics of these groups result in these diﬀerences . Analysis of the network components highlights that their formation and development play a decisive role in the scale of the transmission network . As nine components made up the majority ( 59 . 09 % ) of the total transmission contacts , it is clear that a few major components constitute the main body of the network . In addition , inﬂuential patients ( with higher outdegree or betweenness ) are predominantly found in these major components , which may mean that inﬂuential patients connecting as small components may contribute to much of the transmission events when compared to sole inﬂuencers or superspreaders ( 25 , 26 ) . Therefore , to limit the size of the network , it is necessary to prevent cases from forming a giant component in the contact network and restrain the formation and development of several major components , that is , to avoid the occurrence of cluster infections in practice . Family aggregation may favor disease transmission and parentage is the relationship with the highest infection risk within a family cluster . The family has speciﬁc importance in the context of infectious disease dynamics ( 27 ) . Several epidemiological studies have reported that a substantial amount of COVID - 19 transmission occurs within households ( 28 , 29 ) . Family is the basic clustering unit of any society , and it is diﬃcult for family members to eﬀectively isolate themselves from other members . Good hygiene awareness and habits for family members are essential during the normalization stage ( 30 ) . The study shows in - house quarantine is not eﬀective , therefore , building temporary housing units to quarantine suspected infections is necessary to limit the spread . In addition , community infection cannot be ignored , particularly in public places such as chess and card parlors , which were infection hotspots in this outbreak . Mahjong , a popular pastime among older Chinese people , is usually played close to each other in crowded , poorly ventilated rooms . Furthermore , the elderly is a high - risk group , who are vulnerable to the virus ( 31 ) . In one instance , P30 , a 60 - year - old female , frequently visited a chess and card parlor from July 16 to 20 , during which time she transmitted the virus from her daughter - in - law to six other people . Therefore , such densely crowded places with frequent close contact need to be managed and controlled . As discussed earlier , as the majority of individuals do not contribute to transmission , there is beneﬁt in preventing relatively rare superspreading events . Identifying factors and the characteristics of settings , such as chess and card parlors that could lead to these outbreaks , will play a key role in designing eﬀective control strategies ( 32 , 33 ) . Routine temperature checks and Health Code veriﬁcation should be required for anyone seeking to enter these places to prevent admission to suspected virus carriers , and the number of visitors should be restricted to limit personnel aggregation . In addition , it is worth noting that most patients had used taxis or ride - hailing . Moreover , two of the reported cases were taxi drivers . Due to the nature of this occupation , drivers usually have a wide urban mobility range , and they can easily spread the virus across a region . Hence , the management department should impose more strict epidemic prevention regulations for taxis and ride - hailing , requiring drivers to disinfect , ventilate their vehicles , and protect their health . We also noticed that some patients ( 41 , 24 . 85 % ) had an inconclusive infection pathway into the network . An unbroken transmission chain plays an important role in epidemic prevention and control ( 34 ) . For example , by constructing transmission chains , researchers found that the spread of COVID - 19 in the northern region of Italy had occurred earlier than February 20 , 2020 , when the ﬁrst COVID - 19 case was conﬁrmed in the Lombardy region ( 35 ) . This highlights the fact that contact tracing eﬀorts should be further improved in China . Due to data limitations , there are still some shortcomings in this study . The contact network only can capture part of the dynamic transmission process of COVID - 19 as contact relationships were not fully reported in some cases . Therefore , future studies can conduct relevant analyses based on more complete and comprehensive data that can be acquired from other database sources . Of course , this requires a lot more eﬀort in epidemiological investigations . From this , we suggest that the exposure history of each infected individual is recorded as completely as possible by health administrators and a uniform format is developed for daily reports to show structured data . In the process , attaching great importance to privacy protection is required . Policymakers should develop a standard for processing and releasing such data . Also , the privacy rights holders should be provided with the opportunity to participate in the negotiation . These eﬀorts can assist in tracing integrated transmission networks and improving awareness of these in COVID - 19 epidemics . CONCLUSION By constructing and analyzing the contact networks of conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases , we show the evolution of the epidemic in the city from the perspective of individual - level and social interaction processes . Our study indicates that virus transmission is closely Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 10 June 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 879340 Wang et al . COVID - 19 Epidemic Embedded Social Network related to urban life and social interaction , which suggests more attention should be focused on fundamental social and urban factors in the transmission of COVID - 19 , and not only the biological features of the virus itself . Evidence from real - world examples is used to explain this to help increase public awareness of the epidemic , formulate countermeasures , and allocate limited public health resources for urban management .
