Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 128876 Summary Eukaryotic cells use multiple routes for receptor internalization . Here , we examine the topographical relationships of clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytic structures on the plasma membranes of leukemia - derived mast cells . The high affinity IgE receptor ( Fc e RI ) utilizes both pathways , whereas transferrin receptor serves as a marker for the classical clathrin - mediated endocytosis pathway . Both receptors were tracked by live - cell imaging in the presence or absence of inhibitors that established their differential dependence on specific endocytic adaptor proteins . The topology of antigen - bound Fc e RI , clathrin , dynamin , Arf6 and Eps15 - positive structures were analyzed by 2D and 3D immunoelectron microscopy techniques , revealing their remarkable spatial relationships and unique geometry . We conclude that the mast cell plasma membrane has multiple specialized domains for endocytosis . Their close proximity might reflect shared components , such as lipids and adaptor proteins , that facilitate inward membrane curvature . Intersections between these specialized domains might represent sorting stations that direct cargo to specific endocytic pathways . Key words : Fc e RI , Endocytosis , CME , CIE , Arf6 , Eps15 , Mast cell Introduction The endocytosis field has reached an important and critical stage , as several decades of work have led to new appreciation of the complex network of adaptor proteins involved in classical clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) ( Traub , 2009 ) , as well as the intimate relationship between receptor internalization and signal transduction ( Sorkin and von Zastrow , 2009 ) . In addition , there is now abundant evidence for clathrin - independent ( CIE ) receptor internalization pathways ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ; Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) . These alternative pathways mediate the endocytosis of receptors important in immune regulation , such as the IL - 2R a and c c cytokine receptors ( Lamaze et al . , 2001 ; Sauvonnet et al . , 2005 ) . The spatial relationships and interconnectivity between the various players in the CME and CIE pathways is of keen interest . Prior evidence suggests that the endocytic efficiency and / or route for specific receptors depends on complex factors such as aggregation state ( Andrews et al . , 2009 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ; Mellman and Plutner , 1984 ) or ligand dose ( Sigismund et al . , 2005 ) . The best - known example of a receptor that utilizes both CME and CIE pathways is the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ( Sigismund et al . , 2005 ; Sorkin and von Zastrow , 2009 ) . For the CME pathway alone , at least four distinct and interactive mechanisms converge to regulate EGFR uptake , endosomal signaling and degradation ( Goh et al . , 2010 ) . Another class of receptors that utilize multiple internalization pathways is the immunoreceptor tyrosine - based activation motif ( ITAM ) - containing superfamily of immunoreceptors , which includes T - cell antigen receptors ( TCRs ) , B - cell antigen receptors ( BCRs ) and activating Fc receptors ( Martı´nez - Martı´n et al . , 2011 ) . For example , BCRs and high affinity IgE receptors ( Fc e RI ) can take the alternative internalization pathway in cells that are conditionally depleted of clathrin ( Fattakhova et al . , 2006 ; Stoddart et al . , 2005 ) . The general characteristics of CIE pathways include : ( 1 ) sensitivity to cholesterol depletion ; ( 2 ) dependence on dynamin and actin ; ( 3 ) association with lipid rafts ; and ( 4 ) potential involvement of other components , such as Arf6 , Eps15 and epsin , RhoA and / or flotillin - 1 ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ; Glebov et al . , 2006 ; Lamaze et al . , 2001 ; Naslavsky et al . , 2004 ; Radhakrishna and Donaldson , 1997 ; Sigismund et al . , 2005 ; Stoddart et al . , 2005 ) . Clathrin - independent carriers have been described as uncoated tubular or ring - shaped structures ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) . The ‘rip - flip’ technique ( Sanan and Anderson , 1991 ) , which yields well - preserved membrane sheets that can be labeled with immunogold and imaged by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , has not yet been fully exploited for its unique view of the plasma membrane – cytoplasm interface . Here , TEM is combined with live - cell imaging and electron tomography to reveal the close proximity of endocytic machinery that is shared or distinct to the two pathways . Our focus is the endocytic route ( s ) taken by antigen - stimulated Fc e RI in rat basophilic leukemia cells . We show that Fc e RI signaling patches are bordered by distinct topographic features , including multiple coated pits and Arf6 - positive structures that appear to be dome - shaped from the cytoplasmic view . These structures are often abutted or connected through membrane projections . Expression of dominant - negative dynamin blocks Fc e RI internalization Research Article 4913 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e through both clathrin - dependent and - independent pathways , consistent with strong dynamin labeling of both Arf6 and clathrin invaginations . The multi - functional adaptor protein Eps15 is found on novel tubule - like membrane structures , as well as being partially colocalized with receptors and Arf6 . The marked curvature of membrane labeled for Arf6 and Eps15 suggests that these topographical features might represent a reservoir of lipids and other components needed for endocytic budding . Results Fc e RI is internalized through clathrin - dependent and - independent pathways RBL - 2H3 ( ‘RBL’ ) cells are derived from rat leukemia cells and retain many characteristics of mucosal mast cells , including surface expression of 200 , 000 – 300 , 000 Fc e RI molecules . In vivo , Fc e RI typically exists in a stable complex with allergen or pathogen - specific IgE acquired from circulating immunoglobulin pools . Here , cultured RBL cells were pre - incubated for 2 – 24 hours with either unconjugated or fluorescent monoclonal anti - dinitrophenol ( DNP ) IgE , followed by buffer exchange . Endocytosis of the IgE – Fc e RI complex was stimulated by crosslinking with polyvalent antigen ( DNP – BSA or DNP – colloidal - gold ) ( Fattakhova et al . , 2006 ; Molfetta et al . , 2009 ; Wilson et al . , 2000 ; Xue et al . , 2007 ) . Fig . 1A illustrates the remarkable redistribution of crosslinked Fc e RI into dark regions of membrane ( Wilson et al . , 2000 ) that are typically bordered by clathrin - coated vesicles ( arrows ) . For over a decade , we have noted that these sites often contain multiple buds in various stages of vesicle formation , ranging from flat clathrin arrays to mature vesicles ready for fission . When cells are stimulated by DNP – gold , the nanoparticles are often found in coated vesicles ( Fig . 1B ) , providing solid evidence for Fc e RI entry into coated pits . Despite our own repeated observations of Fc e RI in coated pits , Fattakhova and colleagues ( Fattakhova et al . , 2006 ) challenged the role of the clathrin pathway in the uptake of IgE receptors by using siRNA methods to knockdown clathrin and adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) . To evaluate the relative importance of the CME pathway to antigen - stimulated Fc e RI internalization , we compared colocalization of fluorescent IgE – Fc e RI with GFP – clathrin ( Fig . 1C , D ) , to that of Alexa Fluor 555 ( AF555 ) - tagged transferrin with GFP – clathrin . These live - cell imaging experiments were performed at 16 ˚ C to slow endocytosis and improve the chances of capturing coincidence between GFP – clathrin and IgE – AF555 . These representative images show examples of clathin – Fc e RI colocalization ( yellow arrows , Fig . 1D ) , as well as examples of clear separation of clathrin and Fc e RI in antigen - stimulated cells ( Fig . 1C , D , red and green arrows ) . The plot in Fig . 1E shows a statistical evaluation of IgE and clathrin colocalization ( Pearson’s coefficient R 5 0 . 33 ) , as well as transferrin and clathrin ( R 5 0 . 53 ) . Although the colocalization of Fc e RI with clathrin is less robust than of transferrin , the combined results of EM and live - cell imaging are consistent with at least partial utilization of the CME pathway . RNA silencing methods were next used to achieve . 90 % knockdown of clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) ( 4 days siRNA ; Fig . 1F ) . We combined live - cell imaging and flow cytometric assays ( Fig . 1G – I ) to evaluate the impact of CHC knockdown on Fc e RI internalization . Controls are shown in Fig . 1G , where the z - stack composite illustrates the typical punctate intracellular distribution of receptors internalized from the cell surface of antigen - stimulated RBL cells ; red vesicles mark the uptake of AF555 – transferrin and green vesicles mark endocytosed Alexa Fluor 488 ( AF488 ) - tagged IgE – Fc e RI . As shown in supplementary material Movie 1 , both red and green fluorescent puncta decorate the cell interior ; yellow spots indicate endosomal vesicles containing both cargos . By comparison , the z - stack composite image in Fig . 1H ( and the associated supplementary material Movie 2 ) shows that transferrin uptake , but not Fc e RI , was blocked after siRNA - mediated CHC knockdown . Fig . 1I reports results of a flow cytometry assay for Fc e RI internalization , based upon an acid - stripping protocol to remove surface - exposed IgE . These data show that the kinetics of receptor uptake are unchanged after CHC knockdown . Taken together , Fig . 1G – I demonstrate that crosslinked Fc e RI can efficiently take an alternative route for endocytosis if the clathrin pathway is blocked . We note that additional features are often associated with borders of Fc e RI signaling patches , indicated by dotted red outlines in Fig . 1A . Given that these structures lack the honeycomb structure typical of clathrin assemblies and contain abundant gold - labeled Fc e RI , we hypothesized that they represent alternative endocytic carriers . Arf6 is required for Fc e RI endocytosis The small GTPase Arf6 is localized to endosomes ( as shown by immuno - labeling of ultrathin sections ; Peters et al . , 1995 ) , and it is implicated in multiple processes associated with receptor endocytosis and recycling ( Donaldson , 2003 ; Donaldson and Radhakrishna , 2001 ) . To test the possibility that Arf6 is directly or indirectly involved in Fc e RI endocytosis , RBL cells were transiently transfected with either wild - type Arf6 – GFP or a constitutively active , fluorescent form of Arf6 ( Arf6 - Q67L – CFP ) . Surface Fc e RI was loaded with IgE – AF555 , crosslinked with polyvalent antigen ( DNP24 – BSA ) and incubated for various intervals at 37 ˚ C . At the end of the incubation period , cells were rapidly chilled , transferred into ice - cold acidic buffer , to strip IgE – AF555 from any Fc e RI remaining on the cell surface , and imaged by confocal microscopy . Results in Fig . 2A , B show that cells expressing Arf6 - Q67L – CFP ( cyan arrow , Fig . 2B ) had markedly diminished uptake of IgE – Fc e RI ( red arrows , Fig . 2A ; supplementary material Fig . S1D ) by comparison to untransfected cells ( white arrow , Fig . 2B ) . Control experiments shown in the supplemental material demonstrated that IgE binding in cells expressing wild - type or mutant Arf6 – CFP was not altered ( supplementary material Fig . S1A , B ) , and also confirm that antigen - stimulated Fc e RI uptake was normal in cells with elevated levels of wild - type Arf6 ( transfected with wild - type Arf6 – CFP ) ( supplementary material Fig . S1C ) . We next sought insight into the role of Arf6 at the plasma membrane by TEM imaging of immunogold - labeled membrane sheets prepared from transfected cells ( Fig . 2C – F ; supplementary material Fig . S2A , B ) . Results showed that Arf6 was markedly enriched in roughly circular structures , often 200 – 400 nm in diameter . The Ripley’s bivariate statistical test was applied to confirm colocalization of anti - GFP 6 - nm gold ( labeling Arf6 ) and 10 - nm - ligand - coated gold bound to Fc e RI b ( Fig . 2G – J ) . We note that Arf6 - labeled structures are often connected by bridge - like structures to coated vesicles ( arrow , Fig . 2E ) or occasionally encompass or border clathrin - coated membrane ( arrows , Fig . 2F and supplementary material Fig . S2C , D ) . In order to determine whether the close association between Arf6 - positive Journal of Cell Science 126 ( 21 ) 4914 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e structures and clathrin is dependent on receptor activation , we scored over 600 similar features in resting and antigen - treated cells . Results are summarized in supplementary material Fig . S2E ; almost 40 % of Arf6 structures were in close proximity to clathrin in resting cells , increasing to , 60 % in antigen - stimulated cells . On the basis of the expectation that membrane features mediating CIE should be invaginated , EM grids bearing immunogold - labeled Arf6 membranes were next examined by electron tomography . Fig . 3 provides 3D reconstructions of Arf6 - positive structures from resting cells ( Fig . 3B , C ) and antigen - stimulated cells ( Fig . 3E , F , H , I ; supplementary material Movies 3 , 4 ) ; aspects are from the top ( Fig . 3B , E , H ) , at a 30 ˚ angle ( Fig . 3C , F , I ) or side ( Fig . 3K ) . The corresponding 2D TEM image is shown on the left for all three reconstructions ( Fig . 3A , D , G ) . Locations of gold nanoparticles in these images are represented by red spheres . Arrows point to clathrin - coated membrane near or within these structures . These images provide the first 3D views of Arf6 structures as seen from the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane . Remarkably , they show that Arf6 structures can appear as full domes ( Fig . 3A – F ) or as ‘donuts’ ( Fig . 3G – I ) . At present , we Fig . 1 .

( I ) Internalization assay of Fc e RI by flow cytometry on cells treated or not with anti - clathrin siRNA . Cells were primed with fluorescent IgE and stimulated with DNP24 – BSA . Endocytosis was measured by flow cytometry using acid stripping to distinguish the fraction of surface versus internalized receptors . Scale bars : 100 nm ( A ) , 50 nm ( B ) , 1 m m ( C , D , G , H ) . Fc e RI endocytosis in mast cells 4915 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e cannot distinguish between the possibility that the donut - like features indicate an intermediate structure associated with the CIE process or the alternative possibility that they represent domes whose center has collapsed during sample preparation . Importantly , analysis of multiple Arf6 - positive structures revealed that the height of these structures ranged from 150 – 300 nm ( averaging , 200 nm ) , with a curvature index of , 0 . 0025 ( Fig . 3J ) . Dynamin as a critical player for Fc e RI endocytosis Dynamin facilitates the final stages of vesicle formation , by acting as a ‘pinch - ase’ during the fission step ( Schmid and Frolov , 2011 ) and was previously implicated in Fc e RI endocytosis ( Fattakhova et al . , 2006 ) . Data in Fig . 4A confirm that the transient expression of dominant - negative dynamin ( DYN - K44A ) , but not expression of wild - type dynamin ( WT DYN ) , blocks the antigen - stimulated uptake of fluorescent IgE as measured by flow cytometry of acid - stripped RBL cells . Electron micrographs in Fig . 4B , E show the relative distribution of wild - type dynamin with respect to labels for Fc e RI and clathrin . We point out that there is strong dynamin labeling at the periphery of coated pits , a view that is uniquely possible in the rip - flip method , consistent with prior reports ( Damke et al . , 1994 ; Sundborger et al . , 2011 ) ( see supplementary material Movie 5 ) . It suggests that dynamin recruitment to the edges of forming Fig . 2 . Arf6 is required for Fc e RI endocytosis . ( A , B ) RBL cells transiently transfected with Arf6 - Q67L – CFP were primed with IgE – AF555 and then stimulated with DNP24 – BSA for 10 minutes at 37 ˚ C . Remaining surface IgE – AF555 was then removed by acid stripping prior to fixation with PFA and imaging .

( G – J ) Ripley’s bivariate statistical co - clustering test corresponding to images shown in C – F , respectively . Scale bars : 10 m m ( A , B ) , 100 nm ( C – F ) . Journal of Cell Science 126 ( 21 ) 4916 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e vesicles is a step that precedes the assembly of the dynamin ‘collars’ described by others ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . These dynamin - labeled peripheral projections are particularly dramatic features of coated pits and flat arrays in cells whose endocytosis is stalled by expression of DYN - K44A – CFP ( Fig . 4C , D ) . Consistent with these observations , cells stably expressing DYN - K44A – eGFP show an accumulation of dynamin puncta at the cell surface ( supplementary material Movie 7 ) in comparison to cells stably expressing wild - type DYN – eGFP ( supplementary material Movie 6 ) . In addition , dynamin and Fc e RI labeling was observed together in irregular round membrane structures . Colocalization in these features was confirmed using the Ripley’s test for Fc e RI with both wild - type and mutant dynamin , although the dynamin labeling was typically denser in the cast of the mutant ( Fig . 4G , H ) . Arrows in Fig . 4E , F point to the dynamin gold label that marks projections extending from the edges . On the basis of the similarity of these round features to Arf6 - labeled structures , it seemed likely that they represented the same entity . To address this , we performed both live - cell imaging and triple - labeling TEM experiments . RBL cells were doubly transfected with wild - type monomeric Kusabira orange 2 Fig . 3 . 2D TEM images and 3D reconstructions of Arf6 endocytic structures . ( A , D , G ) TEM images of a membrane sheet from RBL cells transiently transfected with WT Arf6 ( 6 nm gold ) , primed with IgE ( A ) and then stimulated with DNP - gold ( 10 nm gold ) for 2minutes at 37 ˚ C ( D , G ) .

Fc e RI endocytosis in mast cells 4917 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e ( mKO2 ) - tagged Arf6 and wild - type DYN – eGFP , primed with Pacific Blue 410 ( PB410 ) - tagged IgE , and examined by confocal imaging either before or after crosslinking of Fc e RI with DNP24 – BSA . Results are shown in Fig . 5 . In resting cells ( Fig . 5A ) , both Arf6 and dynamin mostly showed a diffuse distribution . At 2 minutes after stimulation of Fc e RI , both Arf6 – mKO2 and DYN – eGFP were found in puncta with marked overlap . Even at this early stage of Fc e RI aggregation , discrete puncta contain all three fluorescent proteins ( IgE – PB410 , Arf6 – mKO2 , DYN – eGFP ) . By 5 minutes of antigen stimulation , numerous puncta showed overlap ( arrowheads in intensity plots ) . This conclusion was confirmed in membrane sheets labeled for the same three proteins in Fig . 5D , E ( Fc e RI , blue ; Arf6 , red ; dynamin , green ) . One notable observation is the concentration of dynamin ( green spheres ) primarily on the periphery or base . These images strongly suggest that these highly invaginated structures are linked to the clathrin - independent internalization of Fc e RI . Eps15 – a required adaptor protein for Fc e RI internalization through CME and CIE , and a marker for highly curved membranes We next focused on additional strategies to differentiate between clathrin - mediated and clathrin - independent endocytic pathways in mast cells . On the basis of work by Paolini and colleagues ( Molfetta et al . , 2009 ) implicating the Eps family of proteins in IgE receptor endocytosis , we double - labeled membrane sheets from activated mast cells for Fc e RI and the endocytic adaptor protein , Eps15 . Rip - flips were prepared after 2 – 5 minutes of exposure to antigen . Results were striking , showing several distinct patterns : ( 1 ) densely labeled Eps15 membrane adjacent to , but poorly mixed with , clustered Fc e RI ( Fig . 6A , B and supplementary material Fig . S3F , G ) ; or ( 2 ) coincident labeling of Fc e RI , Eps15 and Arf6 on both dome - like ( Fig . 6C and supplementary material Fig . S3K ) and tubular ( supplementary material Fig . S3I – J ) structures . Tubular Eps15 structures were striking features on RBL membranes ( Fig . 6D ) . Like Arf6 , Fig . 4 . Dynamin is essential for Fc e RI endocytocis . ( A ) RBL cells transiently transfected with WT or K44A dominant - negative dynamin were primed with IgE – AF488 and then stimulated with DNP24 – BSA for 10 minutes at 37 ˚ C . Cells were then acid stripped prior to fixation with PFA and the percentage of internalized Fc e RI was measured by flow cytometry . ( B , F ) Electron micrographs of membrane sheets showing 6 nm gold - labeled dynamin WT or K44A , and 10 - nm - gold - ligand bound Fc e RI after 3 minutes stimulation at 37 ˚ C .

Journal of Cell Science 126 ( 21 ) 4918 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e Eps15 - labeled structures are often adjacent to coated pits ( Fig . 6A , B ; supplementary material S3H , J ) . IgE receptor internalization was next evaluated in cells transfected with either wild - type or dominant - negative Eps15 – eGFP fusion proteins ( WT Eps15 – eGFP or Eps15 - DIII – eGFP , respectively ) . A null version ( Eps15 - D3 D 2 – eGFP ) served as a negative control . Results are reported in the Fig . 6I – K and in supplementary material Fig . S3D – F . We found that wild - type Eps15 – eGFP overexpression resulted in accumulation of bright fluorescent objects at the cell periphery ( green , Fig . 6I ) . These punctate structures remain in contact with the plasma membrane , based upon confocal z - stack reconstructions ( supplementary material Movie 8 ) . Uptake of both receptors was normal in cells expressing either wild - type Eps15 ( Fig . 6I ) , or the null version ( Eps15 - D3 D 2 ; supplementary material Fig . S3A , C ) . Expression of Eps15 - DIII – eGFP dramatically blocked transferrin uptake and partially blocked antigen - stimulated Fc e RI internalization ( Fig . 6J ) . Partial block of Fc e RI internalization is consistent with previously published results showing that triple knockdown of Eps15 , Eps15R and epsin are required to ablate Fc e RI endocytosis ( Molfetta et al . , 2009 ) . We also noted a large increase in the incidence of flat clathrin arrays on membranes prepared from cells Fig . 5 . Arf6 and dynamin colocalize upon Fc e RI crosslinking .

We do not yet know the identity or function of these pools of Eps15 . We speculate that they represent nucleation sites where Eps15 and associated F - BAR proteins associate with specific lipids needed to form invagination cups for one – or perhaps both – internalization pathways . Consistent with this intriguing notion , the 3D tomographic reconstructions show that heavily labeled Eps15 structures are highly curved ( Fig . 7 ; supplementary material Movie 9 , 10 ) . They extend inwardly to almost the same degree as Arf6 - positive structures , with a maximum height of 200 nm ( Fig . 7G ) and a curvature index of up to 0 . 0028 per nm . Fig . 6 .

Journal of Cell Science 126 ( 21 ) 4920 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e Pitstop2 blocks CME and CIE in mast cells Our evidence for spatial relationships between Arf6 , Eps15 and clathrin structures suggest that Fc e RI signaling patches represent ‘sorting stations’ for internalization by the two complimentary pathways . To investigate further the relationship between these endocytosis pathways , we evaluated the ability to block receptor uptake with the inhibitor Pitstop2 ( von Kleist et al . , 2011 ) . This compound was originally described as a specific CME inhibitor , based upon its direct association with clathrin terminal domain ( TD ) and on in vitro evidence that it inhibits formation of the complex between the clathrin TD and amphiphysin . A recent article by Donaldson and colleagues indicates that Pitstop2 also blocks CIE , raising the possibility that this drug has other common or distinct targets in the endosome sorting process ( Dutta et al . , 2012 ) . Given that the original characterization of Pitstop2 was performed in HeLa cells , we first established conditions for blocking of transferrin internalization in these cells ( 60 m M Pitstop2 ; Fig . 8A – C ) . In RBL cells , 30 m M Pitstop markedly diminished both transferrin and IgE – Fc e RI uptake ( Fig . 8E ) with essentially a complete block of internalization for both receptors at 60 m M ( Fig . 8F ) . Fig . 8G – I show z - stack reconstructions of fluorescent IgE - labeled Fc e RI puncta in control ( Fig . 8G ) and Pitstop2 - treated cells ( Fig . 8H , I ) . Supplementary material movies 11 , 12 show that Fc e RI aggregates are internalized within minutes after antigen - mediated crosslinking in control cells . These aggregates are largely trapped on the cell surface when cells are pre - treated with Pitstop2 before antigen addition . Discussion Upon aggregation by IgE and polyvalent antigens , Fc e RI redistributes to distinctive plasma membrane ‘signaling patches’ that recruit tyrosine kinases , adaptor proteins and other components to propagate the signaling cascade ( Wilson et al . , 2000 ; Wilson et al . , 2001 ; Wilson et al . , 2004 ) . By documenting that the signaling - competent Fc e RI is also spatially related to key proteins controlling both clathrin - mediated and clathrin - independent endocytosis pathways , we infer that the signaling patches are also the locations for sorting of Fc e RI into endocytic carriers . This is a critical connection because the duration of signaling at the plasma membrane is directly linked to the rate at which receptors are internalized . We also confirm that Fc e RI endocytosis by both routes is dependent upon dynamin ( Fattakhova et al . , 2006 ) and show that , although the CME pathway can be utilized by aggregated Fc e RI , it is unlikely to be the major route . Fc e RI internalization is blocked by Pitstop2 , a reagent that has been recently shown to affect both pathways ( Dutta et al . , 2012 ; Lemmon and Traub , 2012 ) . What triggers the internalization of Fc e RI and other closely related immunoreceptors ? On the basis of the mutagenesis studies of Metzger and colleagues , Fc e RI cytoplasmic tails lack specific endocytic sorting signals ( Mao et al . , 1993 ; Mao et al . , 1991 ) . Instead , the extent of aggregation is the key criteria regulating the internalization of Fc e RI ( Andrews et al . , 2009 ) . This is a feature shared with glycolipids , such as gangliosides and glycosphingolipids , whose endocytosis by several routes can be Fig . 7 . 2D TEM images and 3D reconstructions of Eps15 structures . ( A , D ) TEM images of a membrane sheet from RBL - 2H3 cells labeled with an anti - Eps15 antibody ( 10 nm gold ) , primed with IgE and then stimulated with DNP - gold ( 5 nm gold ) for 10 minutes at 37 ˚ C .

Fc e RI endocytosis in mast cells 4921 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e activated by crosslinking ( Oliver et al . , 2007 ; Torgersen et al . , 2001 ) . Linked to aggregation state is the recruitment of ubiquitin ligases , such as Cbl ( Wilson et al . , 2002 ) , that catalyze ubiquitylation of receptors and / or associated cytosolic partners . Subsequent steps in the process include recruitment of ubiquitin - binding proteins that serve both distinct and overlapping functions for both CME and CIE pathways . ( Hurley and Wendland , 2002 ; Paolini and Kinet , 1993 ; van Bergen en Henegouwen , 2009 ) . Parallels can be found in the epidermal growth factor receptor literature . For example , Sigismund et al . ( Sigismund et al . , 2005 ) proposed that Cbl - mediated ubiquitylation of clathrin - associated endocytic machinery is favored at low ligand doses of EGF , whereas ubiquitylation of EGFR itself is substantial only at high ligand doses where endocytosis ‘switches’ to a non - clathrin pathway . Consistent with ubiquitylation being a driver of Fc e RI endocytosis , we found Eps15 to be colocalized with Fc e RI ( Fig . 6C ; supplementary material Fig . S3H – K ) as well as in distinctive , highly curved membrane areas near receptor signaling patches ( Fig . 6A , B ; supplementary material Fig . S3F , G ) . Eps15 and its family members , Eps15R and Eps15b , are modular proteins that bind mono - ubiquitylated peptides through their UIM domains and are themselves substrates for mono - ubiquitylation ( reviewed in Polo , 2012 ) . Their EH domains interact with other EH domain proteins ( EHDs ) , multiple adaptors ( Epsin1 , STAM , Stonin2 , Numb , synaptojanin ) and phosphatidylinositols ( reviewed in van Bergen en Henegouwen , 2009 ) , whereas their coiled - coil domains mediate oligomerization and capture cargo ( Parachoniak and Park , 2009 ) . Their DPF motifs permit association with adaptins of Fig . 8 . Pitstop2 blocks CME and disturbs CIE of Fc e RI . ( A – C ) HeLa cells , used as a control cell line , were stimulated with Tfn – AF555 in the absence ( A ) or the presence of Pitstop2 at 30 m M ( B ) or 60 m M ( C ) . Transferrin uptake is blocked when using Pitstop2 at 60 m M . ( C ) .

Journal of Cell Science 126 ( 21 ) 4922 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e AP1 and AP2 complexes ( van Bergen en Henegouwen , 2009 ) . Molfetta and colleagues showed that triple knockdown of Eps15 , Eps15R and epsin is needed to ablate Fc e RI internalization ( Molfetta et al . , 2009 ) , which suggests there is partial overlap of their function . Because of heavy Eps15 labeling of tubules near clathrin pits and partial colocalization with Arf6 , we speculate that Eps15 and related proteins provide a reservoir of curved bilayer available to enhance endocytic budding efficiency for both CME and CIE pathways . This concept is consistent with results in cells expressing the dominant - negative form of Eps15 ( Eps15DIII – eGFP ) , where there is a preponderance of flat clathrin arrays and a block in Fc e RI uptake ( Fig . 6J , K ; supplementary material Fig . S3D , E ) . Arf6 , shown here to be required for Fc e RI endocytosis , might be exerting its control through local lipid remodeling . The characteristic dome - like regions that label heavily for Arf6 could be hot spots for the activity of its effectors , phospholipase D and phosphatidylinositol 5 - kinase , and the production of the lipid products phosphatidic acid and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( reviewed in ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ) ) . The observation that Arf6 - Q67L strongly labels these domes is consistent with prior evidence showing that GTP - loaded Arf6 is capable of inserting its N - terminal amphipathic helix into lipid monolayers , preferentially loading onto ( and reinforcing ) positive membrane curvature ( Pasqualato et al . , 2001 ) . Understanding the complex interplay between lipids and proteins in the regulation of endocytosis might be best approached through modern systems biology analytical methods ( Ramanan et al . , 2011 ; Zwang and Yarden , 2009 ) . Here , we point out that these relationships appear to be orchestrated in a spatially integrated manner that requires both mixing and lateral communication . Nossal and Zimmerberg have proposed that ENTH domains in epsin and its relatives can bend membranes by inserting into the inner leaflet ( Nossal and Zimmerberg , 2002 ) ; epsin is a primary binding partners of Eps15 . Once a patch of curved membrane is created , clathrin and other adaptors could move in to provide stability . Even higher degrees of curvature associated with neck constriction have additional requirements , such as dynamin and structurally similar proteins like the EHD ATPases ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ) . Because Eps15 does not follow cargo into coated vesicles ( Cupers et al . , 1998 ) , we propose that endocytic vesicles could begin the budding process from the reservoir of curved membrane created by Eps15 and its binding partners . Rather than displacing this critical machinery , they might move laterally in a fluid process that is suggested by the tubular bridges seen in Fig . 6A , B and Fig . 7A , D . Testing of this hypothesis will require sophisticated single - molecule imaging techniques in live cells , where the time - resolved diffusion process can be directly observed . It will be a challenge to capture the dynamics of sorting and lipid remodeling within the confinements of the Fc e RI signaling patch , where receptor motion is expected to be severely restricted by diffusion barriers and by adaptor - mediated trapping . Materials and Methods Reagents and cell culture RBL - 2H3 and stable transfectants were maintained in MEM ( Invitrogen ; Carlsbad , CA ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , penicillin - streptomycin and L - glutamine . Affinity purified anti - DNP IgE was prepared in house as described previously ( Liu et al . , 1980 ) . Fluorescent IgE conjugates were created using N - hydroxysuccinimide esters of chromophores ( Invitrogen ; Carlsbad , CA ) . Monoclonal antibodies to anti - clathrin heavy chain were purchased from Calbiochem ( San Diego , CA ) and anti - GFP antibodies were from Invitrogen . Secondary antibodies were from Jackson Laboratories . Fluorescent transferrin was from Invitrogen . Primary antibodies directed against mKO2 and Fc e RI b were purchased from MBL International Corporation ( # PM051 ) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology , respectively . siRNA experiments Anti rat CHC ( # E - 090659 - 00 - 0005 ) and non - targeting ( NT ) ( # D - 001910 - 10 - 05 ) siRNA were purchased from Thermo Scientific . RBL cells were incubated with either anti - CHC or NT siRNA at 1 m M in Accel delivery media ( Thermo Scientific ) following the manufacturer’s recommendations . After 72 , 96 and 120 hours , cells were lyzed in RIPA buffer and analyzed by western blotting . Flow cytometric internalization assay RBL - 2H3 cells were primed in suspension by 2 hour incubation at 37 ˚ C with 2 m g / ml Alexa - Fluor - 488 or Alexa - Fluor - 555 - tagged IgE – DNP in MEM plus 10 % FBS . Cells were then pelleted and washed once with HBSS . After washing , cells were stimulated for defined intervals with the indicated doses of DNP – BSA . Samples were then split into two , and one sample for each condition was subjected to a light acid strip by a 10 - minute incubation at 4 ˚ C in 0 . 5 M NaCl and 0 . 2 M acetic acid ( pH 2 . 7 ) to remove any surface - accessible fluorescent IgE . All samples were then fixed by a 20 - minute incubation in 2 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature in PBS , and IgE fluorescence levels were measured by flow cytometry . The ratio of the acid - stripped and non - stripped samples for each condition was then used to calculate the percentage of internalized IgE – Fc e RI . Transient and stable transfection RBL - 2H3 cells were transfected using an Amaxa device ( Lonza ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Stable transfectants were obtained using the appropriate selective agent . Arf6 – CFP - encoding plasmids were from Addgene ( no . 11382 , no . 11386 and no . 11387 ) and dynamin – eGFP - encoding plasmids were from Sandra Schmid ( Scripps Institute , San Diego , Ca ) ; the design of Eps15 – eGFP - encoding plasmids isas describedpreviously ( Benmerahet al . , 1998 ) . The Arf6 – mKO2 - encoding plasmid was constructed by gene fusion PCR between wild - type Arf6 and mKO2 and then sub - cloned into the directional topo vector pcDNA 3 . 1 from Invitrogen . Fluorescence microscopy For live - cell microscopy , cell monolayers were cultured in eight - well Lab - Tek chambers ( Nunc , Rochester , NY ) 24 hours before experiments and primed with IgE – AF488 , IgE – AF555 or IgE – PB410 . Confocal imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM 510 META system equipped with a 63 6 1 . 4 N . A . oil objective . For fluorescence studies , cells were cultured on glass coverslips , treated with polyvalent ligand or drugs as described in figure legends , then fixed for 20 minutes in 2 % paraformaldehyde . Samples were mounted on slides in Prolong Gold ( Invitrogen ) anti - fade reagent prior to imaging . Preparation of plasma membrane sheets , gold labeling for TEM , tomography and image analysis Membrane sheets were prepared as described ( Wilson et al . , 2007 ) . In brief , cells were plated on 15 - mm round , clean glass coverslips 24 and cultured overnight . After defined periods of incubation at 37 ˚ C with or without stimuli , cells on the coverslips were fixed in 0 . 5 % paraformaldehyde for 7 minutes at room temperature . Coverslips were then immersed in ice - cold HEPES buffer ( 25 mM HEPES pH 7 , 25 mM KCl , 2 . 5 mM magnesium acetate ) and inverted onto dry Formvar and poly - L - lysine - coated nickel electron microscopy grids . Pressure was applied to the coverslip for 20 seconds by bearing down with a cork . The coverslips were lifted , leaving sections of the upper cell surface adherent to the poly - L - lysine - coated grid . Membranes were further fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde ( 10 minutes at 4 ˚ C ) . After washing , antigens on the cytoplasmic membrane face were labeled by incubating sequentially with primary antibodies and gold - conjugated secondary reagents . Samples were post - fixed with 2 % glutaraldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature , processed for TEM analysis and 2D images were acquired on a Hitachi H7500 transmission electron microscope . Statistical analysis Digital TEM images were analyzed with a FIJI ( ImageJ ) plugin ( Particle Picker ) customized to find and count coordinates of two sizes of gold particles ( Zhang et al . , 2006 ) . Ripley’s K bivariate function was utilized to evaluate co - clustering using the gold code for MATLAb ( Wilson et al . , 2004 ; Zhang et al . , 2006 ) . The Pearson’s pixel intensity correlation over space coefficients of 2D bi - color confocal images were calculated using the Coloc _ 2 plugin of FIJI . Electron tomography and image analysis Tomographic tilt series ( approximately 2 70 to + 70 ˚ , every 2 ˚ ) were acquired on a Tecnai G2 F20 ( FEI Company ) equipped with an energy filter ( zero - loss , Gatan Inc . ) using a 2020 advanced tomography holder ( Fishione Instruments ) . The data Fc e RI endocytosis in mast cells 4923 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e was collect using SerialEM ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) . Prior to reconstruction , the images were processed for noise reduction and feature enhancement with 150 iterations of curvature anisotropic diffusion ( Whitaker and Xue , 2001 ) as implemented in the CoAn package ( Volkmann and Hanein , 1999 ) . 3D reconstructions were generated using alignment and backprojection algorithms implemented in the IMOD package ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) . Segmentation of membrane compartments was achieved using the watershed algorithm ( Volkmann , 2002 ) after application of 30 6 iterative median filtering ( van der Heide et al . , 2007 ) . The positions of the different sized gold labels were separately extracted using a 3D version of the reduced representation template - matching algorithm ( Volkmann , 2004 ) . Surface and volume representations were generated using Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . Average curvatures were estimated by fitting an ellipsoid to the surfaces of the protruding domes .
