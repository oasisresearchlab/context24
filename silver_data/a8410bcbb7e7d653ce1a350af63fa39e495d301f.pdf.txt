Our understanding of IDPs , however , falls far behind that of well - structured proteins . X - ray crystallography and electron microscopy have no practical application for IDPs because intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) hamper crystallization and are too thin to be visualized by electron microscopy . Nuclear mag - netic resonance ( NMR ) spectrometry is so far most instrumental in the structural analysis of IDPs 4 , 5 but provides only distance restraints between amino - acid ( aa ) residues separated by < 2 nm . To comple - ment NMR short - range structural information and estimate the overall dimensions of IDPs , small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) is used 6 . However , both are ensemble - averaging methods that can - not examine individual conformations and their populations . To mitigate this problem , computational ensemble generation of disor - dered conformations is attempted by simulations 7 , 8 or using statisti - cal distribution of coil conformations from structure databases 9 , 10 . Single - molecule Förster resonance energy transfer spectroscopy , which can resolve structural and dynamic heterogeneity , can be used for the structural analysis of chemically denatured proteins and IDPs 11 – 13 . Nevertheless , the donor and acceptor have to be in close proximity ( less than about 10 nm ) . Thus , we still lack versatile tech - niques enabling simultaneous and temporal assessment of both local ( even with semiresidue resolution ) and overall structures of IDPs . Here we explored the potential of HS - AFM 14 , 15 for structural and dynamics analysis of IDPs . All imaging experiments were performed in amplitude modulation mode , where a cantilever was vertically oscillated at its resonant frequency of around 1 MHz in buffer solution . The cantilever free oscillation amplitude and the set point amplitude were set at appropriate values so that the loss of cantilever’s oscillation energy per tap was adjusted to be 2 – 3 k B T on average ( k B , Boltzmann constant and T , room temperature in kelvin ) ( Supplementary Note 1 ) . This energy , which is considered to be transferred to the specimen , is partitioned into many degrees of freedom in the specimen and dis - sipates quickly into solution . As demonstrated previously for an IDP , the facilitates chromatin transcription ( FACT ) protein , HS - AFM can visualize the thin and flexible structure of IDRs 16 , 17 . These studies , along with numerous previous HS - AFM studies performed on struc - tured proteins , for example , refs . 18 – 21 , have ruled out possible effects of the tip - sample contact on the structural properties and function of the protein under study . The present study on various IDPs shows that HS - AFM can identify the fully disordered regions and the bor - der between disordered and folded regions , at the near residue level . Moreover , it provides information on the structural transition dynam - ics and the structural nature of transiently folded conformations . Structural analysis of PQBP - 1 constructs We first imaged polyglutamine tract binding protein - 1 ( PQBP - 1 ) and its four deletion constructs with shorter IDRs placed on mica , at 13 . 1 – 23 . 8 frames per second ( fps ) using HS - AFM ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ) . The HS - AFM video ( Supplementary Video 1 ) revealed that wild - type ( WT ) PQBP - 1 has a small globule at one end and a long flexible , thin structure ( that is , IDR ) ( Fig . 1b , top ) , consistent with previous NMR data 22 . The N - terminal seg - ment ( 1 – 47 ) , for which no NMR data are available , appeared to be part of the globule containing the ordered WW domain ( 48 – 81 ) .

Noda 4 , Mamoru Sato 5 , Marina Lotti 6 , Mineyuki Mizuguchi 7 , Sonia Longhi 3 ✉ and Toshio Ando 1 ✉ Intrinsically disordered proteins ( IDPs ) are ubiquitous proteins that are disordered entirely or partly and play important roles in diverse biological phenomena . Their structure dynamically samples a multitude of conformational states , thus rendering their structural analysis very difficult . Here we explore the potential of high - speed atomic force microscopy ( HS - AFM ) for character - izing the structure and dynamics of IDPs . Successive HS - AFM images of an IDP molecule can not only identify constantly folded and constantly disordered regions in the molecule , but can also document disorder - to - order transitions . Moreover , the number of amino acids contained in these disordered regions can be roughly estimated , enabling a semiquantitative , realistic descrip - tion of the dynamic structure of IDPs .

To measure the two - dimensional ( 2D ) end - to - end distance ( R 2D ) of the IDRs , the direct distance D between the N - terminal globule and the C - terminal end was measured , followed by measurements of the N - terminal globule height H 1 and the C - terminal end height H 2 . R 2D was estimated as R 2D = D − H 1 / 2 − H 2 / 2 ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Note 2 ) . The estimated values of 〈 R 2D 〉 , 〈 H 1 〉 and 〈 H 2 〉 of PQBP - 1 ( 1 – 214 ) were independent of the imaging rate within the tested range ( 6 . 7 – 50 fps ; Extended Data Fig . 1 and Supplementary Table 2 ) , indi - cating no notable structural deformation of the molecule by its con - tact with the tip . Moreover , in WT PQBP - 1 the C terminus position was circularly distributed around the WW domain ( Fig . 2a ) , and a c d b f 265 1 48 WWD PRD CTD 82 104 164 134 114 190 214 1 1 1 1 WT PQBP - 1 ( 1 – 265 ) PQBP - 1 ( 1 – 214 ) PQBP - 1 ( 1 – 164 ) PQBP - 1 ( 1 – 134 ) PQBP - 1 ( 1 – 114 ) 184 aa 133 aa 83 aa 53 aa 33 aa 164 1 . 07 s 3 . 74 s 4 . 53 s 19 . 54 s 22 . 31 s 22 . 44 s 1 . 37 s 18 . 48 s 23 . 06 s W T P Q BP - 1 ( 1 – 265 ) P Q BP - 1 ( 1 – 214 ) P Q BP - 1 ( 1 – 164 ) P Q BP - 1 ( 1 – 134 ) P Q B P - 1 ( 1 – 114 ) 18 . 09 s 18 . 30 s 22 . 11 s 1 . 83 s 6 . 26 s 6 . 80 s 0 10 20 30 10 20 30 40 R 2D ( nm ) 0 180 360 N u m be r o f f r a m e s 0 40 R 2D ( nm ) 0 160 320 N u m be r o f f r a m e s 10 20 30 0 40 R 2D ( nm ) 0 200 400 N u m be r o f f r a m e s PQBP - 1 ( 1 – 214 ) N = 1 , 753 , Mol = 4 〈 R 2D 〉 = 14 . 4 nm s . e . m . = 0 . 14 nm 0 10 20 30 40 R 2D ( nm ) 0 130 260 N u m be r o f f r a m e s WT PQBP - 1 ( 1 – 265 ) N = 1 , 360 , Mol = 4 〈 R 2D 〉 = 17 . 2 nm s . e . m . = 0 . 09 nm PQBP - 1 ( 1 – 164 ) N = 1 , 190 , Mol = 3 〈 R 2D 〉 = 11 . 0 nm s . e . m . = 0 . 04 nm PQBP - 1 ( 1 – 134 ) N = 1 , 178 , Mol = 3 〈 R 2D 〉 = 9 . 3 nm s . e . m . = 0 . 07 nm 10 20 30 0 40 R 2D ( nm ) 0 200 400 N u m be r o f f r a m e s PQBP - 1 ( 1 – 114 ) N = 925 , Mol = 4 〈 R 2D 〉 = 7 . 1 nm s . e . m . = 0 . 02 nm 0 1 2 3 H 1 ( nm ) 0 250 500 N u m be r o f f r a m e s WT PQBP - 1 ( 1 – 265 ) WWD N = 1 , 360 , Mol = 4 〈 H 1 〉 = 1 . 9 nm s . e . m . = 0 . 002 nm e 0 1 2 3 H 2 ( nm ) 0 350 700 N u m be r o f f r a m e s WT PQBP - 1 ( 1 – 265 ) Tail - end N = 1 , 360 , Mol = 4 〈 H 2 〉 = 0 . 5 nm s . e . m . = 0 . 005 nm D R 2D H 2 H 1 / 2 H 2 / 2 Mica H 1 P 2 P 1 Fig . 1 | Structural features of PQBP - 1 constructs revealed by HS - AFM imaging . a , Domain diagrams of five PQBP - 1 constructs containing IDRs ( light blue ) , folded WWD ( grey ) and the N - terminal segment not investigated with NMR ( yellow ) . b , HS - AFM images and schematized molecular features of PQBP - 1 constructs .

The averaged absolute values of displacements in the x direction were nearly identical to those in the slow scan ( y ) direction ( Fig . 2c ) . Since the HS - AFM images were captured during tip scanning relative to the sample stage from the − x to + x direction , these data showing no directional bias in the C terminus displacements ascertain no effect of tip - molecule contact on the IDR motion . Besides , the autocorrelation functions of time series of R 2D showed no correlation of its change over time even when the HS - AFM images were captured at 50 fps , suggesting no impediment of the mica surface and tip to IDR diffusional motion on this time scale ( Fig . 2d – f ) .

NATurE NANOTECHNOLOGY | VOL 16 | FEBRUARY 2021 | 181 – 189 | www . nature . com / naturenanotechnology 184 Articles NATurE NANoTEcHNology where L represents the contour length of a chain 24 . For an unstruc - tured polypeptide chain , L = ( N aa – 1 ) × 〈 d aa 〉 , where N aa is the number of aa contained in the chain and 〈 d aa 〉 is the average distance between two adjacent aa , with the most likely value of 〈 d aa 〉 being 0 . 36 nm ( ref . 25 ) . The L p values estimated for these constructs were 1 . 16 , 1 . 15 , 1 . 11 , 1 . 35 and 1 . 45 nm in the order of decreasing construct length . The chain conformations of these IDRs are very likely to be affected to some extent by their confinement to the liquid – mica interface because of their prominently flexible nature . To assess this influence , we performed SAXS measurements in solution ( that is , not on mica ) using four IDRs of PQBP - 1 ( 82 – 265 , 82 – 214 , 82 – 164 and 82 – 134 ) , yielding values of radius of gyration 〈 R g 〉 of 3 . 62 ± 0 . 05 , 3 . 10 ± 0 . 18 , 2 . 69 ± 0 . 04 and 2 . 14 ± 0 . 04 nm , respectively ( red circles in Fig . 3n , Extended Data Fig . 2 and Supplementary Table 3 ) . In Gaussian chains , 〈 R 2D2 〉 is theoretically identical to 2 × 〈 R 3D2 〉 , where R 3D is the end - to - end distance in solution , and the value of 〈 R 3D2 〉 / 〈 R g2 〉 is 6 . 0 when L » L p ( ref . 26 ) . Therefore , we expect 〈 R 2D2 〉 / 〈 R g2 〉 ≈ 12 . 0 . However , the 〈 R 2D2 〉 / 〈 R g2 〉 values of the fully disordered IDRs were considerably larger than 12 . 0 ( 20 . 0 on average ) , indicat - ing that the mica surface expands the IDR 2D dimensions roughly by a factor ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 20 = 12 p I ≈ 1 . 3 . Its possible cause could be frictional forces locally exerted from mica against fast Brownian motion of the IDR chain , which would increase the IDR chain’s undulation wavelength and / or decrease the undulation amplitude , resulting in swelling of its 2D dimensions 27 . Structural analysis of autophagy proteins Next , we imaged autophagy proteins containing longer IDRs , Atg1 ( D211A kinase - dead mutant ) and Atg13 ( Fig . 3 and Supplementary Videos 2 and 3 ) . The IDR of Atg1 ( D211A ) showed a double - Gaussian distribution of R 2D ( Fig . 3h ) , suggesting interactions between the IDR and the dead kinase domain , in agreement with phosphoryla - tion of the IDR by the N - terminal kinase domain of the WT protein ( Extended Data Fig . 3b ) . The IDR of Atg13 exhibited temporarily appearing and disappearing small globules ( Fig . 3d , 9 . 2 and 30 . 0 s ) , resulting in a double - Gaussian distribution of R 2D ( Fig . 3l ) . Since the four small regions within the IDR ( red bars in Fig . 3c ) are known to interact with Atg1 or Atg17 ( ref . 28 ) , the small globules probably cor - respond to these regions . The 〈 R 2D 〉 values in the longer IDR states of Atg1 and Atg13 were 20 . 5 ± 1 . 42 and 28 . 1 ± 4 . 62 nm ( Fig . 3h , l ) , respectively , and remained nearly unchanged upon pH increase from 6 to 8 for both proteins and upon modification of both salt type and concentration for Atg1 ( Fig . 3i , m ) . In contrast , the 〈 R 2D 〉 values in the shorter states varied ( Extended Data Figs . 3 and 4 and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 ) . Since the IDRs in the longer states are considered to be fully disordered , we estimated their L p values using ( N aa , 〈 R 2D 〉 ) = ( 255 , 20 . 5 nm ) for Atg1 and ( N aa , 〈 R 2D 〉 ) = ( 477 , 28 . 1 nm ) for Atg13 , yielding L p of 1 . 18 and 1 . 17 nm , respectively . These ‘measured L p values’ close to each other are also close to those of the IDRs in the PQBP - 1 constructs . The height of the C - terminal end of Atg13 was 0 . 5 ± 0 . 2 nm ( mean ± s . d . ) ( Fig . 3k ) . Structural analysis of N TAIL Next , we observed the C - terminal domain of the measles virus ( MeV ) nucleoprotein ( N TAIL ) . Its Box1 ( 401 – 420 ) and Box2 ( 486 – 502 ) regions were previously shown to correspond to a molecular recognition element 29 , 30 of helical nature ( α - MoRE ) in equilibrium among completely unfolded and folded helical conformations 30 – 34 . We used N TAIL constructs fused at their N or C terminus to green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) or thioredoxin ( Trx ) to impede the oth - erwise very fast diffusion of N TAIL . N TAIL - GFP ( Fig . 4a ) showed a thin and flexible tail - like structure and a C - terminal GFP globule with mean height of 3 . 2 nm ( ref . 35 ) ( Fig . 4d , g and Supplementary Video 4 ) . The IDR showed a temporarily appearing and disap - pearing small globule at the N terminus corresponding to Box1 ( Fig . 4d ) . Except for this , the IDR was observed to be fully disordered ( with mean height of 0 . 4 − 0 . 5 nm ) ( Extended Data Fig . 5a ) . Box2 was indiscernible due to its close proximity to GFP but appeared in the images of Trx - N TAIL ( Extended Data Fig . 6 , and Supplementary Fig . 1 and Supplementary Video 5 ) . The R 2D histogram of the IDR in N TAIL - GFP showed a single Gaussian peak at 11 . 6 ± 0 . 1 nm ( Fig . 4h and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , consistent with the very small population of Box1 in the higher state , as observed in both N TAIL - GFP ( Fig . 4k ) and N TAIL - Trx ( Extended Data Fig . 7f , i and Supplementary Video 6 ) , and the large popula - tion of Box2 in the higher state as observed in Trx - N TAIL ( Extended Data Fig . 6e ) . From 〈 R 2D 〉 = 11 . 6 nm and N aa = 88 in the IDRs span - ning 421 – 485 and 503 – 525 , L p was estimated to be 1 . 16 ± 0 . 02 nm , a value close to those described above . HS - AFM images of N TAIL - Trx also gave similar 〈 R 2D 〉 values at pH 6 . 0 and 7 . 0 ( 11 . 2 ± 0 . 1 and 11 . 1 ± 0 . 1 nm , respectively ) ( Extended Data Fig . 7e , h ) , yielding L p values around 1 . 06 nm . However , HS - AFM images of Trx - N TAIL gave a slightly smaller value , 〈 R 2D 〉 = 10 . 1 ± 0 . 1 nm ( Extended Data Fig . 6d ) , resulting in a smaller L P value ( 0 . 86 ± 0 . 02 nm ) , possibly due to an increased order propensity of Box1 induced by interaction with the adjacent Trx . To gain more insights into the structural transitions of Box1 and Box2 , we measured their height H 2 . The H 2 histograms of Box1 in N TAIL - GFP and N TAIL - Trx ( at pH 6 . 0 and 7 . 0 ) , as well as that of Box2 in Trx - N TAIL , showed double - Gaussian peaks at 0 . 8 and 1 . 1 nm ( Fig . 4k , Extended Data Figs . 6e and 7f , i and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 ) . Moreover , despite the single Gaussian distribution of R 2D , these H 2 distributions were correlated with the corresponding R 2D distributions ( Fig . 4n and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , suggesting that the IDR length partly changes due to order – disorder transitions in these globules . The order propensity of Box1 and Box2 was estimated from the population ratios ( K e ) between their higher and lower states , yielding K e = 0 . 19 – 0 . 28 ( depending on the pH value ) and K e = 1 . 91 ( at pH 6 . 0 ) , respectively ( Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 ) . The H 2 value of 0 . 8 nm is larger than the height of fully disordered regions , indicating that Box1 and Box2 are both partially ordered , even in their lower height states . The H 2 value of 1 . 1 nm is identical to the diameter of a single α - helix , suggesting that Box1 and Box2 are α - MoREs , consistent with previous studies 29 , 32 . From these features , the dynamic structure of N TAIL could be sketched ( Fig . 4q ) . Power law for 〈 R 2D 〉 In the above observations , we used proteins with IDR boundaries previously identified at the residue level . The 〈 R 2D 〉 values of these IDRs in their fully disordered state were plotted against N aa ( Fig . 3n ) , together with a data point ( N aa , 〈 R 2D 〉 ) = ( 121 , 14 . 3 ± 0 . 18 nm ) obtained by our previous HS - AFM study for a fully disordered IDR in unphosphorylated FACT protein 17 .

The resistance of the N - terminal 27 – 99 region of PNT to proteolysis in the presence of trifluoroethanol 37 ( a secondary structure stabi - lizer 33 , 34 ) , cannot be rationalized from the NMR studies , thus suggest - ing the existence of a large - scale structure undetectable by NMR . To shed light onto this issue , we imaged a PNT segment ( 1 – 229 ) fused to GFP ( PNT - GFP , Fig . 4b ) . PNT - GFP exhibited a thin and flexible tail - like structure with a temporarily appearing and disappearing small globule at the N - terminal end , together with the C - terminal GFP ( Fig . 4e and Supplementary Video 7 ) . In addition , a small glob - ule close to GFP could be occasionally detected ( middle panel in Fig . 4e ) , very probably corresponding to α 4 . The R 2D histogram of the IDR was best fitted to a double Gaussian with peaks at 8 . 9 ± 0 . 33 and 14 . 3 ± 9 . 26 nm ( Fig . 4i ) . The mean height of the IDR was 0 . 4 – 0 . 5 nm , in both metastable shorter and longer states ( Extended Data Fig . 5b ) , indicating that the IDR is fully disordered even on disorder - to - order transition of the small globule . Unlike R 2D , the H 2 histogram of the N - terminal small globule undergoing transitions was best fitted to a single Gaussian with a peak at 1 . 1 ± 0 . 003 nm ( Fig . 4l ) . To estimate N aa in the IDR , we used both the power law 〈 R 2D 〉 = 1 . 16 × N aa 0 . 52 and 〈 L p 〉 = 1 . 18 nm as obtained above , yielding N aa = 52 and 129 from the power law , and N aa = 54 and 128 from 〈 L p 〉 for the shorter and longer states , respectively . Therefore , the number of aa contained in the small globule is roughly estimated to be 175 and 100 for the shorter and longer tail states , respectively ( α 4 does not much affect the estimate ) . The number around 100 suggests that α 1 / 2 , α 3 ( 87 – 93 ) and the IDR segment between them ( 38 – 86 ) are contained in the small globule in both longer and shorter IDR states . Therefore , the region encompassing the N ter - minus and helix α 3 always forms a compact structure , explaining the resistance to proteolysis of the N - terminal segment extending to aa 99 . The number around 175 suggests that the structural transitions between the two states mainly occur by association and dissocia - tion between the N - terminal compact structure and the acidic IDR ( 124 – 168 ) ( Fig . 4r ) . Note that 〈 H 2 〉 = 1 . 1 nm possibly corresponds to the height of α - helices contained in the small globule . Structural analysis of Sic1 Finally , using Sic1 - GFP ( Fig . 4c ) we studied this IDP that possesses a propensity to adopt a collapsed chain - like form 38 . Sic1 - GFP exhib - ited a thin and flexible tail - like structure with a temporarily appear - ing and disappearing small globule at the N - terminal end , together with the C - terminal GFP ( Fig . 4f and Supplementary Video 8 ) . The R 2D histogram for the IDR was best fitted to a double Gaussian with peaks at 12 . 2 ± 0 . 66 and 20 . 5 ± 2 . 14 nm ( Fig . 4j ) . The IDR is fully disordered in both shorter and longer states , as judged from its mean height of 0 . 4 – 0 . 5 nm in both metastable states ( Extended Data Fig . 5c , d ) . The H 2 histogram for the N - terminal small globule undergoing transitions was best fitted to a double Gaussian with peaks at 0 . 9 ± 0 . 05 and 1 . 3 ± 0 . 28 nm ( Fig . 4m ) . The height differ - ence ( 0 . 4 nm ) between the two states is small , compared to the large difference ( 8 . 3 nm ) between the two 〈 R 2D 〉 values , suggesting that the partially folded state has a flattened , collapsed structure , consis - tent with a previous study 38 . As done above for PNT - GFP , we esti - mated N aa contained in the shorter and longer IDRs ; we obtained N aa = 95 and N aa = 259 from the power law and N aa = 95 and N aa = 255 from 〈 L P 〉 = 1 . 18 nm for the shorter and longer states , respectively . Therefore , from the total number of aa contained in Sic1 ( 284 ) , the number of aa contained in the small globule was estimated to be about 30 and 190 for its lower and higher states , respectively . The large number around 190 indicates that as much as about 65 % of the whole protein is loosely folded , with only the remaining C - terminal region ( encompassing about 95 aa ) being fully extended . The remarkable difference between 30 and 190 indicates that a large seg - ment containing about 160 residues undergoes a transition between fully unstructured and loosely folded conformations ( Fig . 4s ) . The folding propensity derived from the H 2 distribution ( K e = 1 . 6 ) is close to that estimated from the R 2D distribution ( K e = 1 . 5 ) . Order propensity and structural transition dynamics From all K e values obtained above , we can infer , for all small globules undergoing transitions , the following relative order propensity : PNT > Box2 ( N TAIL ) > Sic1 » Box1 ( N TAIL ) ( Fig . 4q – s and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 ) . Disorder predictions failed to detect these subtle differences ( Supplementary Figs . 4 and 5 ) , underlining the importance of experimental analysis of order – disorder transitions . The order propensity and the transiently ordered structures very probably dictate key features in binding of these IDPs to their targets ( Supplementary Note 4 ) . Next , we calculated autocorrelation functions G ( τ ) for time - series H 2 ( t ) or R 2D ( t ) data of these IDPs to estimate the order - to - disorder and disorder - to - order transition rates ( k OD and k DO , respectively ) . The rate constants can be expressed as k OD = λ / ( 1 + K e ) and k DO = λ K e / ( 1 + K e ) , where λ ≡ k OD + k DO is the decay rate of G ( τ ) . All G ( τ ) were best fitted to single exponential functions ( Fig . 2g – m ) . Time correlations in the G ( τ ) for R 2D ( t ) ( Fig . 2k , m ) reflect the order – disorder transitions , because Brownian undulation motion of constantly disordered IDRs in PQBP - 1 constructs is too fast to appear in G ( τ ) ( Fig . 2d – f ) . In fact , in Sic1 the G ( τ ) for H 2 ( t ) and R 2D ( t ) were nearly identical ( Fig . 2l , m ) . In contrast to the widely varying lifetime of the ordered state ( 0 . 16 – 1 . 89 s ) among these IDPs , the lifetime of disordered state does not vary much ( 0 . 49 – 0 . 94 s ) ( Fig . 4q – s and Supplementary Table 6 ) . refinement of mica effect , power law and L p SAXS data of non - canonical IDPs obtained by truncation of foldable proteins yielded ν = 0 . 54 , despite their hydrophobic nature 39 . SAXS data of chemically denatured proteins yielded ν = 0 . 598 ( ref . 40 ) , indicating that chemically denatured proteins are more extended than native IDRs 11 , 41 and behave as polymer chains in good solvent ( theoretically ν = 0 . 6 , ref . 23 , or 0 . 588 , ref . 42 ) . In contrast , 〈 R g 〉 ver - sus N aa plots for 72 naturally occurring IDPs without permanent secondary structures were found to be largely scattered 43 , possibly due to residual structure leading to varied compactness . In fact , this inference is corroborated by detailed structural analyses for some of the 72 IDPs 44 – 48 ( Supplementary Note 5 ) . Here we should empha - size that unlike SAXS , our HS - AFM method can single out IDRs in the fully disordered state even when they undergo disorder – order transitions . We here selected ten tau - protein constructs that are not much affected by the extended repeat domains and phosphor - mimic mutation 47 . Then , we combined those 〈 R g 〉 data with those of the four PQBP - 1 constructs herein reported . Fitting this data set to a power law yielded 〈 R g 〉 = ( 0 . 25 ± 0 . 038 ) × N aa0 . 53 ± 0 . 028 ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . A very close power law ( 〈 R g 〉 = 0 . 254 × N aa0 . 522 ) was previously obtained for several IDRs from their theoretical 〈 R g 〉 values calcu - lated using the coil database 49 . This agreement prompted us to use these 14 experimental ( N aa , 〈 R g 〉 ) data to quantitate more accurately the expansion effect of the mica surface on 〈 R 2D 〉 , while assuming that this effect is independent of N aa . The measured 〈 R 2D 〉 values of the IDRs ( in the longer state when undergoing transitions ) were converted to corresponding 〈 R g 〉 values as 〈 R g 〉 = 〈 R 2D 〉 / ( 2 ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p I u ) , where u is the expansion factor . Then , these nine ( N aa , 〈 R g 〉 ) data sets containing the parameter u were combined with the above 14 SAXS data sets of ( N aa , 〈 R g 〉 ) . Finally , the combined data were fitted to a power law , yielding u = 1 . 24 ± 0 . 01 and a fitted curve of 〈 R g 〉 = ( 0 . 26 ± 0 . 02 ) × N aa0 . 52 ± 0 . 015 , from which all data points only slightly deviated ( Extended Data Fig . 8a ) . From the 〈 R g ( u ) 〉 values at u = 1 . 24 for the nine IDRs , their L p values in solution were cal - culated ( Supplementary Table 8 ) , yielding 〈 L p 〉 = 0 . 78 ± 0 . 06 nm . Similar L p values can be found in various IDPs 12 , 13 , 43 ( Extended Data Fig . 8b and Supplementary Table 9 ) . NATurE NANOTECHNOLOGY | VOL 16 | FEBRUARY 2021 | 181 – 189 | www . nature . com / naturenanotechnology 187 Articles NATurE NANoTEcHNology Despite the rather small deviations of data points from the power laws of 〈 R g 〉 = 0 . 26 × N aa0 . 52 and 〈 R 2D 〉 = 1 . 16 × N aa0 . 52 , it is advised to avoid generalization of these power laws or the mean L p values of 0 . 78 nm in solution and 1 . 18 nm on mica to all naturally occurring IDRs in their fully disordered state . Indeed , they cannot be applied to IDRs with a high charge density , a large fraction of charged resi - dues ( FCR ) or largely segregated oppositely charged residues char - acterized by large values of κ ( Supplementary Note 6 and Extended Data Fig . 9 ) . The global structure of IDRs has been indeed shown to be modulated by electrostatic effects , that is a high charge den - sity swells the volume of an IDR 11 , 50 , whereas a combination of large FCR and large κ values results in protein compaction 51 , 52 . All IDPs randomly chosen in this study do not possess high charge densities or large values of FCR and κ ( Supplementary Table 10 ) ; their charge densities ( ρ ) range between – 0 . 087 and + 0 . 038 . Small charge densi - ties | ρ | ≤ 0 . 1 are often seen in numerous naturally occurring IDRs ( 50 . 9 % of all IDRs deposited in the Database of Protein Disorder , Extended Data Fig . 9 ) . Although the aa sequence and composition of an IDR modulate its conformational sampling at various extents , we resorted to use the power law and the mean L p value on mica to make a rough estimate of N aa encompassed by the fully disordered IDRs contained in PNT and Sic1 . The delineation from this N aa esti - mation of the global structure of PNT and its transitions appear to be consistent with the domain diagram given by the recent NMR analysis of PNT 36 and with its proteolytic pattern 37 . In the case of Sic1 , the reliability of our quantitative estimation of its global struc - ture and transitions cannot be assessed because structural informa - tion is currently limited . With the above - mentioned caveats , the power laws and mean L p values on mica and in solution obtained above appear to be useful for semiquantitative delineation of the structure and dynamics of IDPs , especially taking into account the current paucity of more useful means for this analysis . Conclusion HS - AFM imaging of IDPs on mica can distinguish fully and par - tially disordered regions as well as fully ordered regions at the near residue level , without fragmentation of the entire chain into shorter pieces . Moreover , HS - AFM imaging can provide not only length and height distributions for distinct regions in an IDP but also information on the structural nature of the transiently folded structures ( for example , α - helix and flattened , collapsed structure ) and their order propensity and transition dynamics . Thus , HS - AFM imaging is an extremely powerful technique for characterizing IDPs , in particular allowing resolving conformational heterogeneity and avoiding the complications arising from ensemble averaging . Thus , when all molecular features revealed by HS - AFM are com - bined with the folded local structure given by NMR , the combined information allows a quantitative delineation of the structural and dynamic characters of IDPs , in a more realistic manner compared to the pictures depicted individually , as demonstrated for PNT .

The DNA encoding full - length PQBP - 1 was inserted into a pGEX6P - 1 plasmid that was used to transform the Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) strain . Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0 . 5 mM isopropyl β - d - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . PQBP - 1 was expressed as a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - fusion protein . After cultivation , BL21 ( DE3 ) cells were collected by centrifugation . The cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 7 . 0 ) and 2 mM dithiothreitol . After cell lysis by sonication and removal of insoluble cell debris by centrifugation , the supernatant was applied to a glutathione sepharose 4B column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiothreitol . After washing the column with the same buffer , the GST fusion protein was eluted from the column by adding 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 5 ) , 50 mM NaCl and 10 mM reduced glutathione . To obtain PQBP - 1 , the GST fusion protein was cleaved with a recombinant rhinovirus 3C protease ( PreScission protease , GE Healthcare ) . The cleavage mixture was passed through the glutathione sepharose 4B column to remove GST and 3C protease . PQBP - 1 with shorter IDRs and four IDR segments were obtained in the same manner as the full - length PQBP - 1 . These constructs , including WT PQBP - 1 , were finally purified by reverse phase high - performance liquid chromatography using a 5C8 - AR - 300 column or a Protein - R column ( Nacalai Tesque ) , followed by dialysis against 20 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 7 . 0 ) . The molecular mass of PQBP - 1 and its fragments was confirmed by matrix - assisted laser desorption – ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry . Preparation of Atg1 and Atg13 . Expression and purification of Atg1 ( D211A ) were performed using the baculovirus expression system and tandem chromatography as reported previously 28 . The DNA encoding C - terminal His 6 - tagged full - length Atg13 was inserted into a pET11a plasmid ( Novagen ) that was used to transform the E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) strain . Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0 . 1 mM IPTG . After cultivation , BL21 ( DE3 ) cells were collected by centrifugation . The cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 500 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole , 5 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 5 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitor cocktail ( Nacalai ) . After cell lysis by sonication and removal of insoluble cell debris by centrifugation , the supernatant was applied to a Ni - NTA column ( Qiagen ) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 500 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole . After washing the column with the same buffer , the protein was eluted from the column by adding 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 100 mM NaCl and 200 mM imidazole . Eluents were further purified by gel filtration using a HiLoad 26 / 60 Superdex 200 PG column ( GE Healthcare ) and 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 150 mM NaCl as elution buffer . Purified Atg1 ( D211A ) and Atg13 were concentrated using Centriprep ( molecular cutoff of 50 , 000 Da ) ( Millipore ) and then stored at − 80 °C . Preparation of GFP - fused proteins . The constructs encoding the GFP fusion proteins used in this study have been already described 53 . They all encode for proteins consisting of an N - terminally hexahistidine tagged IDP ( N TAIL , PNT or Sic1 ) , followed by a linker of 14 residues containing the tobacco etch virus protease cleavage sequence ( Glu - Asn - Leu - Tyr - Phe - Gln - Gly - Ser ) and the GFP , in this order ( Fig . 4a – c ) . The E . coli strain Rosetta ( DE3 ) pLysS ( Novagen ) was used for expression of GFP fusions . Expression and purification were carried out as already described 53 except that immobilized metal affinity chromatography was performed by supplementing both equilibration and elution buffer with 1 M NaCl to get rid of contaminating DNA . Eluents were further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 HR 16 / 60 column ( GE Healthcare ) and 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM NaCl as elution buffer . Proteins were concentrated using Centricon Plus - 20 ( molecular cutoff of 10 , 000 Da ) ( Millipore ) and then stored at − 20 °C . Preparation of Trx - fused N TAIL . The thioredoxin - 6His - N TAIL ( Trx - 6His - N TAIL ) construct was generated as follows . The sequence encoding N TAIL followed by two stop codons was subcloned by Gateway technology from an entry clone , whose sequence had been checked by DNA sequencing 54 , into the Gateway expression vector pETG - 20A ( a gift from A . Geerlof , EMBL ) by LR reaction ( a recombination reaction between attL and attR sites ) . In this construct , the Trx - 6His and N TAIL moieties are separated by a linker ( LYKKAGS ) encoded by the Attb1 cloning site borne by the pETG - 20A vector . To obtain an N TAIL fusion protein only differing for the position of the Trx tag , we designed a construct ( referred to as N TAIL - 6His - Trx ) bearing the same Attb1 - encoded sequence between the 6His tag and Trx . Since another Attb1 cloning site is also present in the cloning vector ( pDEST14 , see below ) , the Attb1 sequence added between the 6His tag and Trx was mutated ( in italics in the primer sequences given below ) in such a way that it could not be recognized by the LR enzyme while still encoding the same linker as WT attb1 . The coding sequence of N TAIL was PCR amplified using the same entry clone bearing the N TAIL coding sequence as above 54 , and primers Attb1 - SD - NT ( GTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTAATAATTTTGTTTAACTTTAAGAA GGAGATATACATATGTCGACTACTgaggacaagatcag ) and NT - link ( GT CATGGTACCATGATGATGATGATGGTGCATATGGCCA GAACCAGAACCGTCTAGAAGATTTCTGTCATTG ) . The coding sequence of Trx was PCR amplified using pETG - 20A as template and primers link - TRX ( CCATCATCATCATCATGGTACCATG AAGccTGTAtAAgAAg GCgGGtagc AGCGATAAAATTATTCACC ) and TRX - stop - Attb2 ( ACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTttattaGGCCAGGTTAGCGT CGAGGAAC ) . After DpnI digestion , 1 µ l of each of the first two PCR product were mixed and then used as template in a third PCR amplification with primers attL1a ( ACCTGTTCGTTGCAACAAATTGATGAGCAATGCTTTTTTATAATGC CAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGC ) and attL2a ( TTTTGACTGATAGTGACCTGTTCGTTGCAACAAATTGATAAGCAA TGCTTTCTTATAATGCCCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGG ) 55 . The third PCR amplification allows to ( 1 ) fuse the first two PCR products , ( 2 ) insert a 6His tag ( underlined in the above primer sequences ) and the Attb1 - encoded linker between N TAIL and Trx and ( 3 ) add Attl1a and Attl2a sequences , respectively , at the 5 ′ and 3 ′ end of the PCR product required for the subsequent cloning step by LR reaction . The product of the third PCR was then inserted into the Gateway vector pDEST14 by LR reaction and checked by DNA sequencing . A detailed description of the two fusion proteins is provided in Supplementary Fig . 1 . The E . coli strain T7pRos 54 was used for expression of Trx - N TAIL and N TAIL - Trx fusion proteins . Cultures were grown overnight to saturation in LB medium containing 100 µ g ml − 1 ampicillin . An aliquot of the overnight culture was diluted 1 : 25 in LB medium and grown at 37 °C . At an optical density ( OD 600 ) of 0 . 7 , IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0 . 5 mM , and the cells were grown at 37 °C for 3 h . The induced cells were collected by centrifugation ( 6 , 000 g for 20 min at 4 °C ) and resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 , 500 mM NaCl , 20 mM Imidazole , 1 mM PMSF ) , supplemented with 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 of lysozyme , 10 µ g ml − 1 of DNase I and protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . After a 20 - min incubation with gentle agitation , the cells were disrupted by sonication ( using a 750 W sonicator and three cycles of 30 s each at 45 % power output ) . Following the removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 14 , 000 g for 30 min , the supernatant was applied onto a Ni ( II ) - loaded 5 - ml His - Trap high - performance column ( GE Healthcare ) previously equilibrated in buffer A . The affinity resin was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A containing 1 M NaCl . After this step , the affinity column was connected in tandem to a Superdex 75 16 / 60 column ( GE Healthcare ) pre - equilibrated in NaP 10 mM , NaCl 200 mM pH 7 buffer . The two connected columns were eluted first using 20 ml of buffer A containing 500 mM imidazole and subsequently using 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7 , containing 200 mM NaCl . The fractions containing the recombinant protein were collected , lyophilized and stored at − 20 °C . For both proteins , mass spectrometry analysis yielded a value that fits perfectly with the expected molecular mass for a form in which the initial methionine has been cleaved off . SAXS analysis . SAXS measurements were performed at 23 °C with a BioSAXS - 1000 system ( Rigaku ) mounted on a MicroMx007HF X - ray generator ( Rigaku ) . A PILATUS100K detector ( DECTRIS ) at a distance of 462 mm from the sample , was used to measure scattering intensities . The IDR segments of PQBP - 1 ( 82 – 134 , 82 – 164 , 82 – 214 and 82 – 265 ) in 10 mM phosphate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 ) were used for SAXS measurements . Circular averaging of the scattering intensities was carried out to obtain one - dimensional scattering data I ( q ) as a function of q ( q = 4 π sin θ / λ , where 2 θ is the scattering angle and λ is the X - ray wavelength 1 . 5418 Å ) by using the program SAXSlab ( Rigaku ) . The I ( q ) data were processed by using the software applications embedded in the ATSAS package 56 . The radius of gyration R g and forward scattering intensity I ( 0 ) were estimated from the Guinier plot of I ( q ) in the smaller angle region of qR g < 1 . 3 . The molar mass of the IDR segments were estimated by comparing I ( 0 ) / c ( where c is the protein concentration ) of the IDR segments to that of ovalbumin , or estimated from Q R ( ref . 57 ) . To correct interparticle interference , I ( q ) data were collected at three different protein concentrations ( 10 , 8 and 6 mg ml − 1 for 82 – 134 and 82 – 164 ; 5 , 3 and 0 . 3 mg ml − 1 for 82 – 214 ; 14 , 10 and 8 mg ml − 1 for 82 – 265 ) . Because the intensity profile of 82 – 134 , 82 – 164 and 82 – 265 did not indicate a concentration effect , the correction for interparticle interference was not applied . The 82 – 214 fragment exhibited weak self - association at 5 and 3 mg ml − 1 . Therefore , a diluted sample ( 0 . 3 mg ml − 1 ) was used for structural analysis . SAXS data are summarized in Extended Data Fig . 2 and Supplementary Table 3 . HS - AFM observation . The procedure for HS - AFM observation of protein dynamics at the single - molecule level has already been described 58 . In brief , a glass sample stage ( diameter , 2 mm ; height , 2 mm ) with a thin mica disc ( 1 mm in diameter and 0 . 05 mm thick ) glued to the top by epoxy was attached onto the top of the Z scanner by a drop of nail polish . A freshly cleaved mica surface was prepared by removing the top layers of mica using Scotch tape . Then a drop ( 2 μ l ) of the diluted sample ( around 3 nM ) was deposited onto the mica surface . After an incubation of about 3 min , the mica surface was rinsed with 20 μ l of an observation buffer shown below for each sample to remove floating samples . The sample stage was then immersed in a liquid cell containing around 60 μ l of the same observation buffer . HS - AFM observation was performed in the tapping mode using a laboratory built apparatus 14 , 15 . The short cantilevers used are custom - made by Olympus ; resonant frequency , around 1 MHz in water ; quality factor , about 2 in water ; spring constant , 0 . 1 – 0 . 15 N m − 1 . The cantilever’s free oscillation amplitude A 0 and set point amplitude A s were set at 1 – 2 nm and around 0 . 9 × A 0 , respectively , NATurE NANOTECHNOLOGY | www . nature . com / naturenanotechnology Articles NATurE NANoTEcHNology so that the loss of cantilever’s oscillation energy per tap was adjusted to be 1 – 3 k B T on average . The imaging rate , scan size and the pixel size for each sample are described in the main text and Supplementary Information . The observation buffers used for the respective IDPs are as follows : PQBP - 1 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 6 . 0 Atg1 20 mM KCl and 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 6 . 0 20 mM KCl and 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 0 20 mM KCl and 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 50 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 Atg13 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 6 . 0 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 0 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 FACT - 10SA 50 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 and 0 . 5 % glycerol ( vol / vol ) N TAIL - GFP 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 6 . 0 N TAIL - Trx 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 6 . 0 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 0 Trx - N TAIL 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 6 . 0 PNT – GFP 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 6 . 0 Sic1 - GFP 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 6 . 0 Analysis of AFM images . To measure topographical parameters ( R 2D , H 1 and H 2 ) , we used a pixel search software program that we had made for a previous HS - AFM study 59 . This program is opened to the public at the following web site : https : / / elifesciences . org / content / 4 / e04806 / article - data # fig - data - supplementary - material . First , AFM images are briefly pretreated ( mostly flattened for scan line non - horizontality ) by our AFM - specific data acquisition software . From an AFM image , the operator roughly finds an end region of IDR and then clicks the mouse pointer at a molecule - free position on the surface that appears very close to the end region . Then , the pixel search program automatically finds a pixel position ( x , y ) having the largest height Z , by searching over n × n pixels around the operator - specified pixel position ( the value of n is appropriately chosen , typically n = 5 ) . The height H ( H 1 or H 2 ) is obtained by subtracting the average height of the substrate surface from the z value . The same procedure is repeated at the other end of the IDR . From the obtained two sets of ( x , y ) coordinates , the direct distance D between the two pixels is calculated , which is followed by a calculation of R 2D value as R 2D = D − H 1 / 2 − H 2 / 2 . The autocorrelation functions G ( τ ) of time - series data x ( n Δ t ) of R 2D and H 2 were calculated as G τ ð Þ  X N � h n ¼ 1 x n Δ t ð Þ � ^ μ ½  x n þ h ð Þ Δ t ð Þ � ^ μ ½  = X N n ¼ 1 x n Δ t ð Þ � ^ μ ½  2 ; where τ ≡ h Δ t and ^ μ is the mean value of x ( n Δ t ) ( n = 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . , N ) .

NATurE NANOTECHNOLOGY | www . nature . com / naturenanotechnology Articles NATurE NANoTEcHNology Extended Data Fig . 5 | Height of fully disordered IDrs contained in three IDP - GFP fusions . To make sure that the IDRs under analysis are fully disordered , HS - AFM images showing longer IDRs were chosen . a , N TAIL - GFP . b , PNT - GFP . c , Sic1 - GFP . d , Height of IDR in Sic1 - GFP as a function of its distance from the N - terminus . AFM images of Sic1 - GFP molecules showing IDR longer than 25 nm were chosen in this height analysis to ensure that the IDR under analysis was formed upon order - to - disorder transition of the N - terminal small globule . The height of IDR was measured as a function of the distance from the N - terminal globule with a bin width of 2 . 5 nm . The height values for different frames and molecules measured within the bin width at each lateral distance were averaged and the mean height was plotted together with s . e . m . The mean height of the N - terminal end ( 0 . 8 nm ) is slightly smaller than the height of peak 1 ( 0 . 9 nm ) shown in Fig . 4m in the main text . This is due to the relatively large bin width ( 2 . 5 nm ) of the lateral distance used in this analysis .

NATurE NANOTECHNOLOGY | www . nature . com / naturenanotechnology Articles NATurE NANoTEcHNology Extended Data Fig . 8 | refinement of expansion effect of mica on the 2D dimensions of IDr and power law for 〈 R g 〉 . a , 〈 R g 〉− N aa relationship for 23 data . The 10 data plotted with the red circles are those from the study by Mylonas et al . for tau protein constructs 47 , with phosphor - mimic constructs and those largely affected by the extended repeat domain 43 , 49 having been removed here . The constructs herein analyzed are tau ht40 , tau K32 , tau K16 , tau ht23 , tau K27 , tau K17 , tau K44 , tau K10 , tau K25 , and tau K23 . The data plotted with the blue circles are those from the present SAXS study for four segments of PQBP - 1 IDR ( 82 − 265 , 82 − 214 , 82 − 164 , and 82 − 134 ) . The nine data plotted with the green circles are those of ( N aa , 〈 R 2D 〉 / ( 2 ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p u I ) at u = 1 . 24 ) of the five PQBP - 1 constructs , Atg1 , Atg13 , FACT protein and N TAIL ( 〈 R 2D 〉 data highlighted with orange color in Supplementary Table 8 are used ) . The value of u were determined by fitting all 23 data to a power law , 〈 R g 〉 = β g × N aa ν , in which the parameter u was contained in the nine data as one of the variables to be determined . The black solid line indicates the best fitting result ; u = 1 . 24 , β g = 0 . 26 nm , and ν = 0 . 52 . b , 〈 R g 〉− N aa relationship for 37 data . The 37 data points include 14 data found from literature search ( black circles ; Supplementary Table 9 ) and those 23 data shown in ( a ) . Fitting of the 37 data points to a power law , 〈 R g 〉 = β g × N aa ν , yielded β g = 0 . 260 ± 0 . 021 nm and ν = 0 . 524 ± 0 . 015 ( black line ) . NATurE NANOTECHNOLOGY | www . nature . com / naturenanotechnology Articles NATurE NANoTEcHNology Extended Data Fig . 9 | Statistics of charge - associated parameters for many naturally occurring IDrs . a , 2D plot of ( N aa , ρ ) ( ρ , charge density ) of naturally occurring IDRs whose information is deposited in the Database of Protein Disorder that gathers information of IDRs that have been confirmed to be disordered . The paired values ( N aa , ρ ) of 1 , 011 IDRs are plotted in this graph . Half of these data points ( 50 . 9 % ) are within the range of | ρ | ≤ 0 . 1 . Note that shorter IDRs are enriched in the database , reflecting the fact that short IDPs tend to be more experimentally characterized than longer IDRs . b , Histogram of κ for the IDRs contained in the database ; IDRs with N aa ≤ 19 were omitted . Each bar of the histogram is divided into four regions according to the value of fraction of charged residues ( FCR ) . The CIDER software program ( opened to public use ) was used to calculate the values of κ and FCR ( see Supplementary Note 6 ) . c , Scatter diagram of ( FCR , κ ) for the IDRs contained in the database ; IDRs with N aa ≤ 19 were omitted . The points shown in red ( 4 . 5 % ) correspond to IDRs that meet the combined condition of κ ≥ 0 . 35 & FCR ≥ 0 . 3 that is considered to be required for the appearance of a distinct volume compaction effect of oppositely charged residues 52 . It would be plausible that a volume compaction effect could be manifest even for IDRs possessing a FCR value less than ( for example ) 0 . 25 , when they have a very large value of κ . To depict such a possibility , the red line is drawn ( κ × FCR = 0 . 35 × 0 . 30 ) . It should be kept in mind however that this is just tentative and awaits future experimental confirmation .
