Forssman antigen , a neutral glycosphin - golipid carrying five monosaccharides , was localized in epithelial MDCK cells by the immunogold tech - nique . Labeling with a well defined mAb and protein A - gold after freeze - substitution and low temperature embedding in Lowicryl HM20 of aldehyde - fixed and cryoprotected cells , resulted in high levels of specific labeling and excellent retention of cellular ultrastruc - ture compared to ultra - thin cryosections . No Forssman glycolipid was lost from the cells during freeze - substitution as measured by radio - immunostaining of lipid extracts . Redistribution of the glycolipid between membranes did not occur . Forssman glycolipid , abun - dantly expressed on the surface of MDCK II cells , did not move to neighboring cell surfaces in cocultures with Forssman negative MDCK 1 cells , even though M ORPHOLOGICAL observations have provided sig - nificant contributions to our present understand - ing of the metabolic processing , the intracellular trafficking , and the function of membrane lipids . However , since many such studies have depended on fluorescent lipid analogues as the principal probe ( van Meer , 1989 ; Pagano , 1990 ) , the resolution was mostly limited to that of the light microscope . In contrast to several very successful immuno - cytochemical localization procedures for proteins ( Hayat , 1989 ; Verkleij and Leunissen , 1989 ) , methods for the reli - able and reproducible immunolocalization of lipids at the electron - microscopic level have not been developed . Such methods should meet the same criteria required for protein localization i . e . , maintenance of antigenicity , immobiliza - tion of antigens , accessibility of antigens , and preservation of overall cellular structure . Proteins can be fixed by alde - hydes without severe loss of antigenicity in many cases . The major technical problem with lipids has not been the lack of well - defined antilipid antibodies ( Feizi , 1985 ) , but the fact that lipids are not immobilized by routine fixatives . This causes their extraction when the tissue is dehydrated with or - ganic solvents during embedding procedures . A number of antibodies has been characterized to recog - nize glycolipids , and the presence of these lipids on the cell surface has allowed the use of pre - embedding methods for © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 91 / 11 / 1009 / 11 $ 2 . 00 TheJournal ofCell Biology , Volume 115 , Number4 , November 1991 1009 - 1019 (cid:9) 1009 they were connected by tight junctions . The labeling density on the apical plasma membrane was 1 . 4 - 1 . 6 times higher than basolateral . Roughly two - thirds of the gold particles were found intracellularly . The Golgi complex was labeled for Forssman as were en - dosomes , identified by endocytosed albumin - gold , and lysosomes , defined by double labeling for cathepsin D . In most cases , the nuclear envelope was Forssman positive , but the labeling density was 10 - fold less than on the plasma membrane . Mitochondria and peroxi - somes , the latter identified by catalase , remained free of label , consistent with the notion that they do not re - ceive transport vesicles carrying glycosphingolipids . The present method of lipid immunolabeling holds great potential for the localization of other antigenic lipids . their immunolabeling . Pre - embedding labeling in combina - tion with plastic embedding ( Stern and Bretscher , 1979 ; Nichols et al . , 1987 ; Seybold et al . , 1989 ) , freeze - etch label - ing ( Tillack et al . , 1983 ; Rock et al . , 1990 ) , and fracture - label ( Barbosa and Pinto da Silva , 1983 ) have provided us with insights in the surface distribution of glycolipids on cells and on liposomes . In contrast , attempts to reveal the in - tracellular distribution of glycolipids have been largely re - stricted to the immunofluorescence level . Indirect immuno - fluorescence staining on semi - thin frozen sections ofMDCK cells has shown that the Forssman glycolipid is not restricted to the apical plasma membrane but mainly occurs intracellu - larly ( Hansson et al . , 1986 ) . Similar observations have been reported in other cell types ( Tanaka and Leduc , 1956 ) and for other lipids ( Symington et al . , 1987 ) . Attempts to define the intracellular locations of glycolipids at the electron mi - croscopic level have not been very successful ( Boddingius and Dijkman , 1989 ; Kanai et al . , 1990 ) . To determine the subcellular distribution of the Forssman glycolipid in MDCK cells at the EM level , we have tried to avoid the problem of lipid extraction in two ways . First , we have taken the most obvious route ofcircumventing dehydra - tion by the use ofthawed ultrathin cryosections . For proteins this is presently the most widely applied and successful pro - cedure for immuno - EM localization . In this method , sec - tions are cut at low temperature from tissue that has been fixed and infused with a concentrated sucrose solution as a cryoprotectant ( Tokuyasu , 1980 ) . In a second approach we dehydrated the tissue by freeze - substitution . This procedure , when applied to nonfixed tis - sue , has been shown successful in making embedding com - patible with lipid retention ( Humbel and Milller , 1984 ; Weibull and Christiansson , 1986 ) and preservation of pure lipidic structures ( Verkleij et al . , 1985 ) . However , tissue and cell fixation by rapid freezing often induces serious freezing damage . Only a few micron at the very surface of the speci - men retains a good ultrastructure without visible ice crys - tals . Larger samples can only be frozen without ice crystal formation after cryoprotection or by the technically rather demanding technique of high pressure freezing ( Moor , 1987 ) . Therefore , rather than using fresh - frozen material , we have combined parts of the cryo - ultramicrotomy and the freeze - substitution procedures by using aldehyde - fixed cells infused with a cryoprotectant for freeze - substitution embed - ding in Lowicryl HM20 . While cryosections were found to suffer from extraction of the Forssman glycolipid ( low labeling ) and partial reloca - tion from membranes over the section , the novel hybrid tech - nique resulted in excellent preservation of the ultrastructure together with highly efficient and accurate localization of the glycolipid . Materials and Methods Cell Culture MDCK strain I and H cells were grown on 24 . 5 - mm diameter Transwell filters ( Costar Data Packaging Corp . , Cambridge MA ) as described before ( van Meer et al . , 1987 ) . Instead ofperforming thecell culture inthe original six - well cluster dishes , the filter holders were suspended in 20 - mm high polypropylene rings . Six of these were placed into a 150 - mm diameter dish containing 100 ml of growth medium , supplying a sixfold larger volume of basal medium per filter . Cells were plated at a density of 3 . 5 x 10 , cells / cm2 and used after 3 - 4 d . Under these conditions , a monolayer of MDCK II cells contained ( 5 . 0 t 0 . 5 ) x 106 cells ( n = 12 ; three experi - ments ) and 129 t 1 ( n = 2 ) nmol phospholipids . This cell density of ( 1 . 1 t 0 . 1 ) x 106 cells / cm2 and the phospholipid composition were identical to those on cellulose ester filters ( Hanssonet al . , 1986 ) . The present cell den - sity in Transwells is twofold higher than when these had been suspended in a six - well cluster dish ( van Meer et al . , 1987 ) suggesting that in the latter situation the medium supply on the basolateral aspect ofthe Transwells was limiting . Immunoreagents The antibody against the Forssman glycolipid , 33B12 , was a gift of A . Son - nenberg ( Central Laboratory ofthe Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) and is a rat monoclonal of the IgG2c sub - class which binds to protein A - Sepharose . The antibody reacts with the ter - minal sugar sequence GaINAc al - 3 GaINAc and is specific for Forssman ( Sonnenberg et al . , 1986 ) . The antibody against cathepsin D was a gift of K . von Figura ( Georg August Universitat , G6ningen , Germany ) ( Giesel - mannetal . , 1983 ) . The anticatalase antibody was raised againsta two times crystallized bovine catalase ( product number C - 100 , Sigma Chemical Company , St . Louis , MO ) and was affinity purified . BSA coupled to 5 - nm gold particles ( BRAG ) ' and protein A - gold complexes ( PAG ) of different size classes were prepared by the tannic acid - citrate method ( Slot and Geuze , 1985 ) . 1 .

Biology , Volume 115 , 1991 Endocytosis ofBSA - Gold Filter - grown MDCK II cells were washed twice with serum - free medium and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in the medium containing BSAG ( 013520 v5 ) on both sides of the cell monolayer . Cells were rinsed quickly with cold 0 . 1 M Pipes buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) and fixed for freeze - substitution . Radio - immunolabeling ofForssman Glycolipid on Thin Layer Chromatograms Cellular lipids were extracted by a one - phase extraction ( Rose and Ok - lander , 1965 ) to avoid loss of Forssman glycolipid into the water phase of a two - phase extraction ( Sonnenberg et al . , 1986 ) . Lipid classes were sepa - rated by thin layer chromatography ( TLC ) on aluminum - backed silica sheets ( SG 60 , Merck , Darmstadt , FRG ) in chloroform / methanol / water 60 : 35 : 8 ( vol / vol ) , after the plates had been prerun in the same solvent sys - tem . The TLC sheet was developed over a distance of45 mm and dried un - der a hair - drier ( 30 min ) . A band of 20 nun in the middle of the TLC sheet containing the Forssman glycolipid ( retention factor of 0 . 3 - 0 . 4 , Hansson et al . , 1986 ; Sonnenberg et al . , 1986 ) was cut out and labeled with the anti - Forssman antibody as described by Magnani et al . ( 1987 ) . The chromato - gram was soaked for 1 min into hexane containing 0 . 4 % poly - isobutyl - methacrylate ( 300K M . W . , Aldrich , Brussels , Belgium ) diluted from a 2 . 5 % stock in chloroform . After drying under the hair - drier for 15 min , the sheet was blocked in blotto ( 5 % milk powder [ wt / vol ] in 50 mM Tris / HCl , pH 7 . 8 , 2 mM CaC12 ) for 30 min . Subsequently , it was placed onto a glass support slightly smaller than the TLC sheet and then in a petri dish lined with wet filter paper . After careful application to the silica surface of an antibody dilution in blotto ( 60 pl / cm2 ) , the petri dish was slowly rocked back and forth horizontally for 60 min at room temperature . The sheet was then washed 4x by dipping into blotto for 1 min , after which it was in - cubated for 60 min with " ' I - protein A . Washes were repeated for 4 x 1 min in blotto and 2 x 1 min in ice - cold PBS . The TLC sheet was air - dried . Forssmanglycolipid was located on x - ray film , exposedat - 70°C . Radioac - tivity was determined by excising the bands from the aluminum sheet and gamma - counting . The corresponding area froma lane whereno lipid extract had been applied served as a blank . Cryo - ultramicrotomy and Immunogold Labeling MDCK cells , grown to confluency in 3 . 4 - cm petri dishes , were fixed for 1 h with 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 4 , onice . Cells were scraped from the petri dish and embedded as a pellet in 10 % gelatin in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer at 37°C . After solidification at 4°C the gelatin was postfixed with 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde at 4°C . Small blocks of - 1 mm , were cut , infiltrated with 2 . 3 M sucrose , mounted on LKB specimen stubs , and frozen in liquid nitrogen ( LKB Instruments , Inc . , Gaithersburg , MD ) . Ultrathin cryosections were cut at - 100°C on a Leica / LKB V with cryo - attachment . Frozen sections were transferred to carbon - coated Formvar grids , immunogold labeled and stained as described before ( Slot et al . , 1988 ) . Thawed sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti - Forssman and subsequently with 12 nm PAG ( 013520 = 0 . 2 ) . Sections were observed and photographed in a Jeol 1200EX electron microscope at 80 kV . Freeze - Substitution andLow Temperature Embedding Transwell filters with a confluent monolayer of MDCK cells were rinsed shortly with 0 . 1 M Pipes buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) and fixed for 1 h in 2 % parafor - maldehyde in 0 . 1 M Pipes on ice . Cells were cryoprotected by immersing the filters for 30 min in 30 % glycerol containing 1 % paraformaldehyde in 0 . 1 M Pipes or 2 . 3 M sucrose . The filters were cut in small squares of Nl mm2 . Several squares were mounted on top of a LKB specimen stub . Glycerol - protected samples were frozen in liquid propane ( - 180°C ) and sucrose - protected samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen . Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen before use . Frozen samples were transferred ( under liquid nitrogen ) into the Reichert Cs - auto freeze - substitution unit . Freeze - substitution was carried out at - 90°C in methanol supplemented with 0 . 5 % uranyl acetate for at least 36 h . After raising the temperature to - 45°C at a rate of 5°C / h and several washes with pure methanol , the samples were infiltrated with Lowicryl HM20 . Infiltration was done in the following graded series of Lowicryl - methanol mixtures : 1 : 1 for 2 h , 2 : 1 for 2 h , pure Lowicryl for 2 h , and pure Lowicryl overnight . The samples were transferred , inside the Reichert Cs - 1010 auto , to a flat embedding mold filled with pure Lowicryl HM20 and poly - merized by UVlight at - 45°C for 2 d . ImmunogoldLabeling ofLowicryl Sections Ultrathin Lowicryl sections were cut perpendicular to the filters with a Leica / LKB III ultramicrotome . The sections were placed on carbon - coated Fornwargrids and labeled according to the following procedure . Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the sections for 20 min on a drop of 5 % FCS in 20 mM Tris , 130 mM NaCl , pH 8 . 2 . Sections were incubated at room temperature with anti - Forssman diluted in 0 . 1 % BSA in 20 mM Tris , 130 mM NaCl , pH 8 . 2 ( BSA / Tris ) , for 1 h . After rinsing three times for 10 min with BSA / Tris the sections were incubated with PAG for 1 h and rinsed three times for 10 min with BSA / Tris , two times for 5 min with Tris , and three times for 10 min withbidistilled water . In double - labeling experi - ments , the last step was followed by fixation of the sections for 10 min with 1 % glutaraldehyde in bidistilled water and blocking with 0 . 02 % glycine in Tris buffer before labeling with the second antibody and PAG of a different size . Sections were stained for 7 min with 3 % uranyl acetate and for 4 min with Reynolds lead citrate ( Reynolds , 1963 ) . Sections were observed and photographed in a Jeol 1200EX electron microscope at 60 kv . Results Preservation of the Cellular Forssman Glycolipid during Freeze - Substitution Radio - immunolabeling of glycosphingolipids after separa - tion by TLC proved to be a reliable method for quantitation of the Forssman antigen in lipid extracts of MDCK II cells ( Fig . 1 ) . Only the Forssman band was detected on exposed films ofthe complete TLC sheet . An accurate standard curve was obtained for the labeling intensity as a function of the amount of cellular lipids applied to the TLC sheet ( Fig . 1 A ) . Under the present growth conditions , 105 MDCK II cells contain - 25 pmol of Forssman glycolipid ( Hansson et al . , 1986 ) . For studying possible loss of cellular lipids dur - ing freeze - substitution , three filters with a confluent mono - layer ofMDCK II cells ( 3 d ) were cut from their holders and subjected to the freeze - substitution procedure . Subsequent - ly , their lipids were extracted and a defined fraction of each extract , equivalent to 2 x 10 5 cells , was subjected to TLC together with extracts from control filters . Quantitation ofthe radioactivity after immunostaining showed that the Forss - man antigen had been completely retained during the freeze - substitution procedure ( 103 t 15 % , Fig . 1 ) . Lanes contain - ing the lipid extract from 2 x 10 5 MDCK I cells yielded blank values . Densitometry of linearly exposed films gave identical results ( data not shown ) . Morphology To mimic as closely as possible the morphology ofan epithe - lium in vivo , MDCK cells were grown on permeable sup - ports . The preparation of ultrathin cryosections of MDCK cells grown on filters turned out to be a cumbersome proce - dure . The cryosectioning often resulted in rupture ofthe cells from the filters , and wrinkled sections . In addition , large empty vacuoles were often observed . In contrast , prefixed and cryoprotected MDCK cells showed excellent overall morphology after freeze - substitution and low temperature embedding in Lowicryl HM20 ( Fig . 2 ) . Extended mono - layers of intact cells on the filter were obtained , in which many large and small vacuoles exhibited internal vesicles and membrane structures . The MDCK cells were nicely polarized , expressing microvilli on the apical plasma mem - van Genderen et al . Localization ofForssrnan Glycolipid by Immuno - BM Figure 1 .

Immunogold Labeling Labeling of ultrathin cryosections with the antibody against Forssman and PAG resulted in a sparse labeling of the apical plasma membrane ( Fig . 3 A ) . Beside the plasma membrane many intracellular organelles were labeled ( Fig . 3 B ) , in - cluding the Golgi complex , electron - lucent , electron - dense , and multivesicular vesicles . However , beside this organelle - associated labeling we often observed gold labeling spread over the cytoplasm and the nucleus ( Fig . 3 B ) on cryosec - 101 1 Figure 2 .

This labeling was probably due to ex - traction and relocation of the Forssman glycolipid during section thawing and the immuno - incubations , since control sections , labeled with an irrelevant antibody , were negative . Identical observations were made on filter grown cells ( data not shown ) . Immunogold labeling of the Forssman antigen on Lowi - cryl sections of freeze - substituted MDCK cells resulted in a dramatic increase of specific label ( Fig . 4 ) . This increase was not due to the omission of the glutaraldehyde fixation since postfixation of sections with glutaraldehyde in the double - labeling procedures did not reduce subsequent label - ing with anti - Forssman ( see Fig . 6 ) . Background labeling over the nuclear matrix was far less than 0 . 1 % of the total number of gold particles per cell . Both the apical and the basolateral plasma membrane were heavily labeled . Quanti - tation showed that the labeling density , expressed as gold particles per membrane length , was 1 . 4 times higher at the apical plasma membrane ( 1 . 12 t 0 . 09 ) than at the basolateral plasma membrane ( 0 . 81 t 0 . 03 ) ( Table I B ) . Mitochondria ( Figs . 4 and 5 A ) and peroxisomes ( Fig . 5 B ) were nega - tive for Forssman labeling . An average of < 1 gold particle / mitochondrion was found , which could be attributed to back - ground labeling . Peroxisomes were identified by double - labeling with an antibody against the peroxisomal marker catalase . Immuno - double - labeling showed that apart from incidental background labeling , all catalase - positive struc - tures observed ( n > 50 ) were negative for Forssman labeling ( Fig . 5 B ) . The negative mitochondria and peroxisomes in - dicate the high specificity of the Forssman labeling . Control experiments in which the primary antibody was omitted , or replaced by an irrelevantantiserum , showed no gold labeling . Intracellular labeling was found in the Golgi complex , in small vesicular and tubular structures underneath the plasma membrane , in vesicular structures throughout the cytoplasm , in larger electron - lucent and electron - dense structures often containing internal membrane structures ( Fig . 4 ) , and in the nuclear envelope ( Fig . 6 ) . The relative distribution of gold particles over the plasma membrane and intracellular mem - branes showed that - 66 % of the label was intracellular ( Table I A ) . The labeling densities in both the Golgi complex ( 0 . 38 f 0 . 4 ) and the nuclear envelope ( 0 . 10 f 0 . 02 ) were clearly lower than the plasma membrane ( Table I B ) . Lyso - somes ( and late endosomes ) , which were double labeled for cathepsin D , contained fairly large amounts ofthe Forssman glycolipid ( Fig . 6 ) . To discriminate between the biosynthetic Figure 4 .

From 14cells oftwo different sections 4 , 304 gold particles of 20 nm were counted directly from the screen in the electron micro - scope at low magnification . ( B ) The labeling density over membranes in the different compartments was calculated from the number of gold particles per corresponding membrane length . The membrane length is expressed as the number of intersections with a sampling grid in 54 , 000x micrographs . The spacing between the lines of the grid was 0 . 36 Fem .

After this incubation BSAG was found in small vesicles , in tubular and tubular - vesicular structures , in multivesicular structures , and in lysosomes ( Fig . 7 ) . Many BSAG positive small vesicles and Figure 5 . Electron micrographs of substitution - embedded MDCK strain II cells labeled for the Forssman glycolipid with 10 run PAG .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 115 , 1991 (cid:9) 1014 tubular - vesicular structures contained the Forssman glyco - lipid . In addition , vesicular structures positive for BSAG were observed that were negative for Forssman , while the opposite was also true ( Fig . 7 ) . In a double - labeling experi - ment , lysosomes as identified by anticathepsin D , were found to contain both BSAG and Forssman ( Fig . 7 ) . Finally , we tested whether Forssman glycolipid when ex - pressed on one membrane , would be able to equilibrate with membranes exposed to it . For this , MDCK II cells were cocultured with Forssman - negative MDCK I cells . Monolayers of MDCK I cells were indeed free of gold after immunolabeling for Forssman ( not shown ) . In mixed mono - layers of MDCK I and II cells , where functional tight junc - tions are formed between the two cell types ( van Meer et al . , 1986 ) , Forssman positive cells were found adjacent to nega - tive cells ( Fig . 8 ) . In areas ofclose contact between the cells , gold label could not be unequivocally assigned to the posi - tive cell . However , from areas where the lateral membranes were sufficiently separated , it can be concluded that redistri - bution of the Forssman glycolipid between apposed mem - branes during coculture or during the EM preparation proce - dure had not occurred . Discussion Forssman Antigen : Structure and Antigenicity The present study describes the immunolocalization of Forssman antigen in MDCK II cells . After its first definition as an antigen ( Forssman , 1911 ) , the molecule was chemically characterized 60 yr later as the five - sugar glycosphingolipid IV ' - GaINACa - Gb4Cer ( IUPAC - IUB nomenclature , 1977 ) or GaINAc al - 3 GaINAc , M - 3 Gal al - 4 Gal / 31 - 4 Glc / 31 - 1 Cer ( Siddiqui and Hakomori , 1971 ) . Although crossreactions of Figure 6 . Substitution - embedded MDCK strain II cells double la - beled for cathepsin D ( 15 nm PAG ) and the Forssman glycolipid ( 10 not PAG ) . The same results were obtained when changing the order of the antibodies or the sizes of the gold . Cathepsin D is present in lysosomes ( 1 ) together with the Forssman glycolipid . Small vesicular and tubular structures , the nuclear envelope ( ne ) and the basolateral membrane ( bl ) next to the filter ( f ) also contain the Forssman glycolipid , but no cathepsin D . Bar , 0 . 2 Am . anti - Forssman antibodies with other glycolipids have been reported , our antibody in MDCK cells most likely reacted with Forssman glycolipid exclusively . ( a ) The present 331312 monoclonal only recognized Forssman glycolipid in a lipid extract in which one other anti - Forssman antibody also reacted with shorter and longer glycolipid species ( Sonnen - berg et al . , 1986 ) . ( b ) In MDCK II lipid extracts run on full length ( 100 mm ) TLC sheets , 331312 stained Forssman glycolipid exclusively . ( c ) Neither of the three potentially crossreacting glycosphingolipids , a ceramide carrying four monosaccharides ( Gahmberg and Hakomori , 1975 ) , one van Genderen et al . Localization ofForssman Glycolipid by / mmuno - EM with seven and one with eight monosaccharides ( Slomiany and Slomiany , 1978 ) were chemically detected in MDCK II cells , whereas Forssman glycolipid constituted 20 - 40 mol of their neutral glycosphingolipids ( Hansson et al . , 1986 ; Nichols et al . , 1986a ; Niimura and Ishizuka , 1986 ) . ( d ) The closely related MDCK I cells , which lack Forssman glyco - lipid ( Hansson et al . , 1986 ) , showed no immunolabeling on TLC or sections ( Fig . 8 ) . ( e ) Finally , the presence of Forss - man activity on glycoproteins ( Slomiany et al . , 1982 ) was unlikely in MDCK II , as inununostaining of a protein blot of MDCK H cells was negative ( not shown ) . Validity ofthe Preparation andLabeling Procedure Our results demonstrate for the first time a reliable intracel - lular localization of a glycosphingolipid at the electron - microscopic level . The immunolocalization of the Forssman antigen combined a high specificity with an excellent mor - phological preservation . Freeze - substitution has been shown previously to result in the retention of most lipids and pro - teins ( Humbel and Killer , 1984 ; Weibull and Christiansson , 1986 ) . This could have been different for lipids containing hydrophilic sugar chains . However , it is demonstrated in the present study that during the preparation procedure the Forssman glycosphingolipid was quantitatively retained ( Fig . 1 ) . The increased labeling density on the plasma mem - brane , as compared to cryosections , points out that the freeze - substitution procedure preserves this glycolipid much better than the cryo - ultramicrotomy method . Morphological studies have also shown that freeze - substitution is capable of preserving pure lipidic structures ( Verkleij et al . , 1985 ) and lipid - rich organelles ( Ikeda , 1985 ) . Here we show that the Forssman glycolipid remained membrane associated , as it did not redistribute during the preparation and labeling procedures . Mitochondria and peroxisomes , Forssman negative membranes according to chemical criteria ( van Meer , 1989 ) , indeed remained free of label . In Figs . 4 , 6 , and 7 the gold label is clearly observed on both sides of the membranes . An interpretation that Forss - man glycolipid would be present in both bilayer leaflets does not fit the accepted view that glycosphingolipids are confined to the non - cytoplasmic leaflets of the membrane bilayers of cellular organelles ( Hakomori , 1981 , 1990 ; Thompson and Tillack , 1985 ) . This view is based on the observations that glycosphingolipids are expressed on the surface but not the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane , and on the local - ization of a number of glycosylation reactions in the lumen of the Golgi and of glycosphingolipid degradation in the lu - men of the lysosomes . Most likely , therefore , the random transmembrane gold distribution is due to folding of the pri - mary antibody or the protein A - gold . The fact that Forsman antigen is expressed on the outside of MDCK II cells ( van Meer et al . , 1986 ; Nichols et al . , 1986b , 1987 ) , while the surface of MDCK I cells within sub - micrometer distance from a positive MDCK II cell surface ( Fig . 8 ) remained Forssman negative , implies that during freeze - substitution the lipid not even exchanged between closely apposed surfaces . On Tight Junction Structure The absence of Forssman from the apical surface of an MDCK I cell that was connected to an MDCK H cell by tight 1015 Figure 7 . Substitution - embedded MDCK strain II cells which had endocytosed 5 nm BSAG for 1 h at 37°C . Sections were double - labeled for the Forssman glycolipid ( 10 rim PAG ) and cathepsin D ( 15 nm PAG ) . BSAG - containing endocytotic profiles often contain the Forssman glycolipid ( arrows in A and B ) but some BSAG positive vesicles are devoid of the Forssman glycolipid ( arrowheads in A and C ) . Dense lysosomes ( 1 ) and more electron - lucent lysosomes ( * ) , lysosomes defined by the presence of cathepsin D , contain BSAG and are labeled for the Forssman glycolipid . Bars , 0 . 2 um . junctions , confirms at the electron - microscopic level the no - tion from earlier light microscopic observations that lipids are unable to diffuse from the apical surface ofone epithelial cell to that of the next , even at a time scale of days ( Nichols et al . , 1986b ; van Meer et al . , 1986 ) . The novel observation that also the lateral surface ofthe MDCK I cell remained free of Forssman under these conditions demonstrates that a bar - rier for lipid diffusion between neighboring cells exists on both the apical and basolateral face ofthe tightjunction . To - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 115 , 1991 gether , these observations argue against the lipid model of tight junctions in its simple form ( Kachar and Reese , 1982 ; Pinto da Silva and Kachar , 1982 ) . Forssman Glycolipid on the Cell Surface Forssman antigen is abundant on the MDCK II cell surface ( van Meer et al . , 1986 ; Nichols et al . , 1986b ; 1987 ; Figs . 4 and 8 ) . Glycosphingolipids on the cell surface have been assigned a variety of functions in growth and differentiation , 1016 Figure 8 . Mixed monolayer of MDCK strain I and strain II cells after 3 d of coculture , immunolabeled for the Forssman glycolipid after substitution embedding . Positive and negative cells are found juxtaposed . Bar , 0 . 5 um . cellular interactions , and signal transduction . In each case , discrete glycosphingolipids would interact with ligands in solution or on apposed cell surfaces ( Curatolo , 1987b ; Hakomori , 1981 , 1990 ) . A specific function ofForssman an - tigen is suggested by the fact that it is expressed at defined stages of mouse embryogenesis and human cancer ( Kanai et al . , 1990 , and refs . therein ) . When present in significant amounts , glycosphingolipids change the physico - chemical properties of the membrane ( exoplasmic leaflet ) . Membrane rigidity increases due to in - termolecular hydrogen bonding between the glycosphingo - lipids , a capacity absent from most phospholipids ( Pascher , 1976 ; Thompson and Tillack , 1985 ; Curatolo , 1987a , b ) . The effect is fully expressed by the one - sugar ceramides , glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide . Prime examples are found in plasma membranes displaying extreme concen - trations of glycosphingolipids , like myelin ( Morell et al . , 1989 ) and apical plasma membranes of epithelia ( Simons and van Meer , 1988 ) , where these lipids account for roughly 30 - 35 mol % of the total lipids . The apical surface ofintesti - nal cells , and also MDCK cells , appears to be covered by glycosphingolipids ( Forstner et al . , 1968 ; Simons and van Meer , 1988 ) . Although the enrichment of ( glyco ) sphingolipids in the ap - ical plasma membrane , accompanied by a reduced percent - age of the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine , seems to be the most general feature of epithelial lipid polarity , the baso - lateral plasma membrane is by no means devoid of glyco - sphingolipids . The surface density ofthe species that consti - tute the bulk of the epithelial glycosphingolipids , notably glucosylceramide , is three - to fourfold reduced on the baso - van Genderen et al . Localization ofForssman Glycolipid by lmmuno - EM lateral surface ( Kawai et al . , 1974 ; Simons and van Meer , 1988 ) . Similarly , Forssman antigen , a bulk glycosphingo - lipid of MDCK II ( Hansson et al . , 1986 ; Nichols et al . , 1986a ; Niimura and Ishizuka , 1986 ) , has been located on both surfaces of MDCK II cells at the electron - microscopic level by preembedding inununogold labeling ( Nichols et al . , 1987 ) , which is now confirmed by immunogold labeling on sections of freeze - substituted MDCK II cells ( Figs . 4 and 8 ) . Chemical analysis of radiolabeled glycosphingolipids that had been shed from the two cell surfaces of MDCK II cells showed that Forssman glycolipid and glucosylceramide dis - played a twofold apical / basolateral enrichment relative to galactosylceramide . However , this work did not provide ab - solute numbers for the apical / basolateral ratio ofthe surface densities of either lipid ( Nichols et al . , 1988 ) . In the present study , we have found 1 . 8 times more gold particles on the api - cal than on the basolateral cell surface ( Table I A ) . The rela - tive surface area of the two domains in MDCK II cells grown under the present conditions has been measured to be 1 . 1 ( apical / basolateral ; Parton , R . , personal communication ) . From these numbers the density of gold particles on the api - cal surface as compared to that on the basolateral surface can be calculated to be 1 . 6 . This is in fair agreement with the rela - tive surface density of 1 . 4 that was measured independently by a direct count of gold particles per membrane length ( Table I B ) , and suggests an enrichment of Forssman glyco - lipid on the apical cell surface . However , it should be real - ized that extrapolation of the measured surface densities of gold particles to surface densities ofthe Forssman glycolipid requires a linear relationship between labeling and Forssman density , for the moment an unproven assumption . One of the potential pitfalls is that Forssman glycolipid tends to orga - nize in small clusters in the membrane and that the size of these clusters may depend on the membrane type ( see Rock et al . , 1990 and refs . therein ) . The quantitative potential of the method is one of the objects of our present studies . Intracellular Distribution ofForssman Glycolipid Two - thirds of the Forssman glycolipid was assigned to defined intracellular organelles ( Table I A ) . This refutes the general idea that glycosphingolipids would be typical plasma membrane components ( Hakomori , 1981 ; 1990 ; Thompson and Tillack , 1985 ; Curatolo , 1987b ) . Evidence for large in - tracellular pools of individual glycosphingolipids has al - ready been providedby immunofluorescence studies ( Tanaka and Leduc , 1956 ; Hansson et al . , 1986 ; Symington et al . , 1987 ) and biochemical studies ( Matyas and Morr6 , 1987 ) . The intracellular compartment in which the presence of Forssman glycolipid is most readily understood is the Golgi apparatus , for this is where the terminal glycosyltransferases are situated ( Paulson and Colley , 1989 ) . Forssman glycolipid was found in the Golgi stacks and in the trans - Golgi reticu - lum ( TGR ) . The TGR has been suggested to be the site of epithelial glycosphingolipid sorting ( Simons and van Meer , 1988 ) . Apical vesicles would bud from areas of the TGR membrane containing microdomains of glucosylceramide and other apically enriched glycosphingolipids , whereas vesicles destined for the basolateral domain would bud from glycolipid poor areas . Our present results do not provide a direct test for this hypothesis . More efficient labeling will be required for a statement on possible microdomains of Forss - man glycolipid in the TGR . 101 7 The localization ofForssman in organelles along the endo - cytic route as defined by the presence of endocytosed BSAG is consistent with what is known about lipid transport . The endosomal lipid composition generally seems very similar to that of the plasma membrane , suggesting that endocytosis does not select for or against specific lipids ( van Meer , 1989 ) . Some vesicles containing endocytosed BSAG were not labeled for Forssman ( Fig . 7 ) . This does not necessarily imply that these vesicles do not contain Forssman glycolipid . Even if a vesicle has the same Forssman content as the plasma membrane , there is a statistical chance that it re - mains unlabeled due to its small size ( see Figs . 4 and 7 ) . Small Forssman - containing structures , negative for BSAG , may be part of the biosynthetic pathway or may lack BSAG due to its inefficient uptake . The abundance of Forssman glycolipid in the internal membranes ofmultivesicular endo - somes and lysosomes ( as defined by colocalization with cathepsin D , Figs . 6 and 7 ) may imply that a large fraction of the intracellular Forssman does not participate in mem - brane recycling between endosomes and the plasma mem - brane . A significant level of Forssman labeling was observed in the nuclear envelope ( Figs . 4 and 6 , Table I B ) , implying the presence of Forssman in the ER . Recently we have observed significant and specific labeling of the nuclear envelope by an antibody against the glycosphingolipid galactosylcera - mide as well . The chemical presence of glycosphingolipids in the nuclear envelope and ER has been suggested by cell fractionation work ( discussed by Matyas and Morré , 1987 ) , but such results have always been subject to the criticism of possible cross - contamination of the fractions . The presence of glycosphingolipids in these membranes is rather unex - pected , because the general idea is that glycosphingolipids are transported by carrier vesicles only , and because a vesic - ular pathway between their site of synthesis , the Golgi , and the ER has not been described . Two possibilities for this pathway are vesicular transport back through the Golgi , or alternatively transport to the plasma membrane and via en - docytic membranes to the ER . Evidence for the latter pro - cess has been reported . After endocytosis of Simian Virus 40 , one third of the virus eventually reached the ER lumen without ever being apparent in the Golgi ( Kartenbeck et al . , 1989 ) . No Forssman labeling was observed in mitochondria and peroxisomes . This nicely illustrates the specificity of the labeling and the fact that lipid redistribution did not occur during the present study . This observation strongly supports the idea that glycosphingolipids are transported in the lumi - nal leaflet of carrier vesicles only and that mitochondria and peroxisomes do not take part in such vesicular exchange processes . Although mitochondria ) fractions have been found to contain glycosphingolipids ( e . g . , Matyas and Morré , 1987 ) , only the present method may be capable of discriminating between real content and contamination by other membranes . Future Prospects The present study demonstrates that it is now possible to localize antigenic lipid molecules in a reliable way even when they contain a hydrophilic sugar chain . This provides us with a new technique for addressing the intracellular dis - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 115 , 1991 tribution and traffic of lipids . Preliminary studies have shown that the method is applicable to antigenic lipids with short sugar chains . Also galactosylceramide has been la - beled , which will now allow for double - labeling of different lipids and the determination of their relative distribution . The first type of information obtained from lipid im - munolabeling is a qualitative discrimination between mem - branes which may or may not contain a certain lipid . With the present level of accuracy it will be possible to firmly es - tablish whether or not the unexpected presence of a certain lipid in an organelle after cell fractionation was due to con - tamination by other membranes . Examples of this are the proposed presence of glycosphingolipids in mitochondria ( Matyas and Morré , 1987 ) , and cardiolipin in the outer mito - chondria ) membrane ( Hovius et al . , 1990 ) . Secondly , as ap - parent from the different labeling densities for the various or - ganelles ( Table I B ) the method has quantitative potential . Obviously , the linearity ofthe labeling will have to be tested before the labeling density data can be translated to surface densities ofthe antigen . Eventually , it will be very important to test whether the method can be extended to study lateral heterogeneities in lipid distribution within a single organelle . These have been shown for proteins , which has been crucial in testing models ofprotein sorting ( Geuze et al . , 1987 ) . All in all , the present method of lipid immunolabeling appears highly promising for providing new insights into the cell bi - ology of lipids .
