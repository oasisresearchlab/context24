However , the factors that recruit the WRC to speciﬁc locations remain poorly understood . Here , we have identiﬁed a large family of potential WRC ligands , consisting of (cid:1) 120 diverse membrane proteins , including proto - cadherins , ROBOs , netrin receptors , neuroligins , GPCRs , and channels . Structural , biochemical , and cellular studies reveal that a sequence motif that deﬁnes these ligands binds to a highly conserved interaction surface of the WRC formed by the Sra and Abi subunits . Mutating this binding surface in ﬂies resulted in defects in actin cytoskeletal organi - zation and egg morphology during oogenesis , lead - ing to female sterility . Our ﬁndings directly link diverse membrane proteins to the WRC and actin cytoskeleton and have broad physiological and path - ological ramiﬁcations in metazoans . INTRODUCTION The actin cytoskeleton undergoes highly dynamic rearrange - ments , a process that is vital to all eukaryotic cells . Members of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family are ubiq - uitous regulators of actin cytoskeletal dynamics ( Campellone and Welch , 2010 ; Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ) . WASP proteins are deﬁned by a conserved C - terminal VCA ( Verprolin - homol - ogy , Central , Acidic ) sequence that stimulates the actin - nucle - ating activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex . The WASP family verprolin homologous protein ( WAVE ) is found in all eukaryotic kingdoms and plays a central role in many cellular processes , including adhesion , migration , division , and fusion ( Pollitt and Insall , 2009 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . In animals , WAVE pro - teins play diverse roles ranging from embryogenesis , neuron morphogenesis and plasticity , immune cell activation and chemotaxis , to cancer invasion and metastasis ( Pollitt and Insall , 2009 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . In cells , WAVE is constitutively incorporated into a conserved , heteropentameric complex of (cid:1) 400 kDa named the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) . This complex consists of the following ﬁve components : Sra1 / Cyﬁp1 ( or the ortholog PIR121 / Cyﬁp2 ) , Nap1 / Hem2 / Kette ( or the ortholog Hem1 ) , Abi2 ( or the orthologs Abi1 and Abi3 ) , HSPC300 / Brick1 , and WAVE1 / SCAR ( or the orthologs WAVE2 and WAVE3 ) ( Eden et al . , 2002 ) . Different WRC isoforms can be assembled from combinations of different orthologs of each component ( Taken - awa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . The structure of the WRC revealed that the complex can be viewed as two subcomplexes : a dimer formed by pseudosymmetric association of the two large , ho - mologous proteins Sra1 and Nap1 and a trimer formed by the N terminus of WAVE1 , Abi2 , and HSPC300 forming a four - helix bundle ( Figure 1A ) ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . Within the WRC , the activ - ity of WAVE toward the Arp2 / 3 complex is inhibited by intracom - plex sequestration of its VCA ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . In response to upstream signals , the WRC is both recruited to the membrane and triggered to release its inhibition of WAVE , which are coop - erative events that are required to achieve optimal activity ( Leb - ensohn and Kirschner , 2009 ; Padrick et al . , 2008 ; Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ) . Many WRC ligands have been described and mainly fall into four distinct classes based on their mechanism of interaction . The ﬁrst consists of small GTPases : Rac directly binds to Sra1 and activates the WRC by allosterically releasing the bound VCA ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) , and Arf can act cooperatively with Rac to promote WRC activation at membranes ( Koronakis et al . , 2011 ) . The second consists of acidic phospholipids ( phosphati - dylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate , PIP 3 , and perhaps others ) , which enhance WRC association with membranes likely via electrostatic interactions ( Oikawa et al . , 2004 ) . The third class contains various kinases , including Abl , Cdk5 , and ERK2 , which phosphorylate the WRC and may regulate its activity by destabi - lizing VCA sequestration or modulating its interactions with other Cell 156 , 195 – 207 , January 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 195 proteins ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . The fourth class contains multimodule scaffolding proteins , including IRSp53 , Toca1 , and WRP , which often utilize SH3 domains to interact with the proline - rich regions of Abi2 and WAVE1 and likely facil - itate membrane recruitment and clustering of the WRC ( Leben - sohn and Kirschner , 2009 ; Padrick et al . , 2008 ; Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . More recently , two single - pass transmembrane cell - adhesion proteins , protocadherin 10 ( PCDH10 ) and PCDH19 , were re - ported to interact with the WRC ( Nakao et al . , 2008 ; Tai et al . , 2010 ) . These proteins do not belong to any of the four known classes of WRC ligands ; therefore , we wondered whether they might represent a new class . Moreover , PCDH10 and PCDH19 are important to brain development ( Emond et al . , 2009 ; Uemura et al . , 2007 ) and are implicated in autism , epilepsy , and mental retardation ( Dibbens et al . , 2008 ; Morrow et al . , 2008 ) . PCDH10 also functions as a tumor suppressor in many cancers ( Ying et al . , 2006 ) . However , little is known about how these proteins—or the protocadherin family in general—signal down - stream . A detailed characterization of interactions of PCDH10 / 19 with the WRC and the actin cytoskeleton might provide valuable clues to the functions of these proteins and their many relatives in the protocadherin family . Here , through further biochemical studies of the PCDH10 / WRC interaction , we have identiﬁed a conserved peptide motif , the WRC interacting receptor sequence ( WIRS ) , that directly binds a conserved surface on the WRC both in vitro and in cells . We further identiﬁed (cid:1) 120 diverse transmembrane or membrane associated proteins that contain the WIRS motif , including proto - cadherins , ROBO proteins , netrin receptors , neuroligins , G - pro - tein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , and ion channels , among others . Disrupting the WIRS - binding surface of the WRC in ﬂies causes defects in actin organization and egg morphology during oogenesis , leading to female sterility , and also causes defects in optic lobe development . Together , our biochemical , structural , cellular , and genetic data reveal a highly conserved and wide - spread interaction motif that links diverse membrane proteins to the WRC and the actin cytoskeleton . RESULTS The WRC Binds to a Conserved Peptide Motif in the Cytoplasmic Tail of PCDH10 The initial reports describing an interaction between PCDH10 or PCDH19 and the WRC left two important questions unan - swered : ( 1 ) whether the interaction was direct and ( 2 ) which sequence ( s ) were responsible ( Nakao et al . , 2008 ; Tai et al . , 2010 ) . To begin addressing the ﬁrst question , we assembled recombinant WRC containing HSPC300 with two maltose - binding proteins ( MBPs ) fused in tandem to its N terminus ( 2MBP - D WRC , Figure 1A ) . Immobilized 2MBP - D WRC efﬁciently retained the puriﬁed cytoplasmic tail ( CT ) of PCDH10 ( Figures 1D and 1E ) . The PCDH10 tail and 2MBP - D WRC also coeluted during gel ﬁltration chromatography ( Figure S1A ) . Finally , isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) indicated 1 : 1 binding stoi - chiometry with a dissociation equilibrium constant ( Kd ) of 0 . 3 m M ( Figure S1B ) . These data indicate that PCDH10 CT directly binds the WRC . We next addressed the second question : which sequence ( s ) are responsible for the interaction ? Previous studies of Figure 1 .

PCDH10 and PCDH19 suggested two candidate elements : ( 1 ) the CM2 ( conserved motif 2 ) sequence , conserved throughout the d - protocadherin family to which both protocadherins belong , and ( 2 ) a more C - terminal region of the tail named the Nap1 - binding fragment ( NBF ) , proposed to interact with the Nap1 sub - unit of the WRC ( Figure 1A ) ( Nakao et al . , 2008 ) . We found that the CM2 motif is not required for direct binding ( Figure 1E ) . Instead , our sequence alignment of the d - protocadherins most closely related to PCDH10 revealed a conserved nine residue sequence , RSFSTFGKE , within the NBF element ( Figure 1B ) . A peptide containing this sequence directly bound the WRC and blocked the interaction with PCDH10 CT ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . The interaction was speciﬁcally abolished by mutation of the Figure2 .

In ( G ) , immobilized 2MBP - D WRC mutants selectively retained GST - PCDH10 CT . See also Figure S2 and Table S1 . conserved threonine to alanine ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . Thus , we conclude that this sequence is both necessary and sufﬁcient for binding the WRC . We then systemati - cally introduced point mutations to the PCDH10 CT throughout this conserved sequence and measured binding of the mutant proteins to the WRC . The results identiﬁed a weak six residue consensus motif , F - x - T / S - F - X - X ( F = preference for bulky hydrophobic residues ; x = any resi - due ; the X - X positions can accommodate single substitutions , but not all combina - tions of double substitutions , Figure 1E ) . We named this new motif WIRS ( Figure 1E ) . Crystal Structure of the WIRS / WRC Complex Reveals Binding Mechanism We next sought to determine where and how the WIRS motif binds to the WRC . For this , we determined the 2 . 43 - A˚ crystal structure of a complex cocrystallized from a variant of the WIRS - containing peptide ( WGAERSM * STFGKEKA , M * for selenomethionine , Figure 1B ) and a minimal inhibited WRC , which lacks the C terminus of Abi and the proline - rich region of WAVE , miniWRC ( Figure 2 and Table S1 ) ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . We observed electron density for eight residues of the bound WIRS peptide ( Figure 2B ) and as - signed the sequence unambiguously to RSM * STFGK , assisted by anomalous dispersion from the selenomethionine ( M * ) , which allowed us to resolve the pseudo - 2 - fold symmetry of the peptide about the ST sequence ( Figure 2B ) . The overall structure of the complex reveals several notable features of the interaction . First , the overall structure of the Cell 156 , 195 – 207 , January 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 197 peptide - bound miniWRC , including the VCA region of WAVE1 , is nearly identical to that of the apo form ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) with backbone root - mean - square deviation ( rmsd ) of 0 . 3 A˚ ( Figure S2 ) . This near identity suggests that WIRS binding per se may not activate the WRC ( see also below ) . Second , the STFG sequence forms a type - I b - turn , which contains a stereo - typical backbone hydrogen bond between the S7 carbonyl and G10 amide and additional backbone hydrogen bonds from the M * 6 carbonyl to the F9 and K11 amides ( Figure 2B ) . Third , the WIRS binds to a composite surface of the WRC , which is formed by both Sra1 and Abi2 ( Figures 2A , 2C , and 2D ) . Because Sra1 is part of the large Sra1 / Nap1 subcomplex and Abi2 is part of the Abi2 / WAVE1 / HSPC300 subcomplex , as suggested by topology of the WRC structure and biochemical reconstitution , Sra1 and Abi2 come together only when the WRC is assembled from these subcomplexes ( Chen et al . , 2010 ; Ismail et al . , 2009 ) . This means that the WIRS binds only to the fully assembled WRC . In agreement , the PCDH10 CT cannot bind WRC subcomplexes containing only Sra1 or Abi2 ( Figure 2F ) . Fourth , in contrast to previous suggestions based on immunoprecipitation data ( Nakao et al . , 2008 ) , no contacts are observed between the peptide and Nap1 . Finally , the structure of the WIRS binding surface clearly explains the speciﬁcity of the consensus WIRS motif , F - x - T / S - F - X - X , derived from the biochemical assays above . M * 6 ( the F 1 position ) packs against E1084 and L1090 of Sra1 and F9 of the WIRS . It acts as a ‘‘plug’’ that completes a deep hydro - phobic pocket that binds F9 , as described below ( Figure 2D ) , explaining the preference for large hydrophobic residues at the F 1 position . The side chain of S7 ( the x2 position ) is directed toward solvent and can be readily altered without affecting binding ( Figure 2D ) . The side chain of T8 ( the T / S3 position ) forms a network of hydrogen bonds bridging E1084 of Sra1 and R106 of Abi2 , with E1084 forming another hydrogen bond with the T8 amide ( Figure 2E ) . This network explains why only threonine and serine are tolerated at the third position in the WIRS sequence . The side chain of F9 ( the F4 position ) inserts into a deep and narrow hydrophobic pocket formed by Y923 , E1084 , L1086 , and L1090 of Sra1 and R106 , I109 , G110 , and T113 of Abi2 and is completed by M * 6 from the WIRS peptide ( Figures 2C and 2E ) . The aromatic ring of F9 stacks against that of Y923 of Sra1 and makes cation - p interactions with R106 of Abi2 ( Figure 2E ) . Together , these explain why phenylal - anine is strongly preferred at this position ( with tyrosine affording observable , but weaker binding ; Figure 1E ) . G10 and K11 ( the last X - X positions ) do not contact the WRC , allowing many res - idues at these positions ( data not shown ) . G10 adopts a left - handed conformation in order to position K11 to hydrogen bond with M * 6 . As this conformation is energetically favorable only for glycine , it is likely that other amino acids at position 10 would adopt different conformations , and the K11 / M * 6 hydrogen bond may not be generally observed . In support of the observed interactions , point mutations to the contact resi - dues on either Sra1 ( E1084A , L1090A , or Y923A ) or Abi2 ( R106A , R106M , or G110W ) all abolished binding to the PCDH10 CT ( Figures 2C and 2G ) . In contrast , changing a prox - imal residue ( Abi2 R107A ) that does not contact WIRS had no ef - fect ( Figures 2C and 2G ) . The WIRS Binding Surface Is Highly Conserved in Metazoans The WIRS binding surface is nearly 100 % conserved in meta - zoans , spanning from human to sponge , including all isoforms of Sra and Abi ( Figure 3 ) . This strongly suggests that WIRS / WRC interactions in general are vital to all animals . Indeed , puri - ﬁed Drosophila WRC ( 2MBP - dWRC ) also bound to the wild - type ( WT ) human PCDH10 CT , but not the mutant with a disrupted WIRS ( Figure 3D ) . Disrupting the binding surface on the Drosophila WRC ( 2MBP - dWRC AW , containing an Abi equivalent to human R106A / G110W ) also abolished the interaction ( Fig - ure 3D ) . Only a few such conserved surface patches exist on the WRC ( Figure 3C ) , including the Rac GTPase binding site on the opposite side of the complex ( data not shown ) ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . The WIRS binding site is conserved even in the WRCs of nonmetazoan choanoﬂagellates , but not in other WRC - expressing nonmetazoans , including protists , fungi , and plants ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . Choanoﬂagellates are considered to be the closest unicellular relatives to metazoans ( King et al . , 2008 ) , and some species have a multicellular stage in their life cycle ( Alegado et al . , 2012 ) . The only metazoan in which the WIRS binding surface is not conserved is the placozoan Tricho - plax adhaerens , which is arguably the simplest free - living animal whose phylogenetic classiﬁcation remains controversial ( Srivas - tava et al . , 2008 ) . Many Membrane Proteins Contain a WIRS in Their Cytoplasmic Regions We next searched the Swiss - Prot database ( Lane et al . , 2012 ) to ﬁnd other human proteins that might use WIRS motifs to bind the WRC . Given the relatively low sequence complexity of the WIRS motif itself , we limited the search to proteins resem - bling PCDH10—membrane or membrane - associated proteins in which the motif is ﬂanked by disordered sequences and thus not part of a folded domain . We further used sequence conser - vation as another criterion to increase our search stringency— we removed ligands whose WIRS motifs were found in less than four of the seven species : human , mouse , chicken , frog , zebraﬁsh , Drosophila , and C . elegans . Although these restric - tions may exclude some potential ligands , they should limit false positives ( Figure 4 ) . Using these criteria , we obtained 115 potential WIRS - contain - ing WRC ligands ( Table S2 ; see http : / / prodata . swmed . edu / WIRS / for unﬁltered results ) . Most of these are cell - cell adhesion proteins or receptors , but some are ion channels or scaffolding proteins . They include 15 members of the protocadherin - a family ( PCDH a ) , 9 other protocadherins , 4 neuroligins , 2 ROBO recep - tors , 3 netrin receptors , various GPCRs , and several ion channels . Many of these proteins are enriched in the nervous or immune systems , although others are widely expressed ( Table S2 ) . Of these , only ﬁve , including PCDH10 , PCDH19 , the netrin receptor DCC ( Bernadskaya et al . , 2012 ; Stavoe et al . , 2012 ) , the Slit receptor ROBO1 ( Bernadskaya et al . , 2012 ) , and the epithelial Na ( + ) channel ENaC ( Karpushev et al . , 2011 ) , have been previously shown to interact with the WRC biochemically or genetically . Furthermore , only a small number have been previously connected with the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig - ure 4 and Table S2 ) . 198 Cell 156 , 195 – 207 , January 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . To verify our search results , we puriﬁed GST - fused cyto - plasmic tails of 18 of these potential ligands and examined their interactions with the WRC using pull - down assays . We found that 13 of these tails , including Neuroligin - 1 , Neuroligin - 4X , ROBO1 , Cav1 . 3 , LRIG3 , PCDH8 , PCDH10 , PCDH12 , PCDH17 , PCDH18 , PCDH19 , PCDH a 6 , and FAT3 , bound the WT WRC , but not a mutant whose WIRS - binding surface was disrupted by mutations ( 2MBP - D WRC AW , containing R106A / G110W - Abi2 ; Figure 4 ) . Disrupting the WIRS binding surface did not affect WRC binding to Rac1 , suggesting that the point mutations only locally disrupted the WIRS - binding site . Therefore , we have identiﬁed a large and diverse class of WRC ligands . Figure 3 . WIRS Binding Surface Is Highly Conserved ( A and B ) Sequence alignments of representative organisms .

( D ) Coomassie - blue - stained SDS - PAGE gel shows that immobilized WT Drosophila WRC , but not a mutant with a disrupted WIRS binding surface ( AW for R118A / G122W - dAbi ) , selectively retained GST - PCDH10 CT ( WT ) , but not a mutant ( AA for T1002A / F1003A ) . WIRS - Containing Tails Have Various Effects on WRC Activity To understand the function of the WIRS / WRC interaction , we ﬁrst tested whether the cytoplasmic tail of PCDH10 ( PCDH10 CT ) could activate the WRC in Arp2 / 3 - mediated pyrene - actin assembly assays . Based on our crystal structure of the WIRS - bound WRC in which the VCA of WAVE1 remains sequestered and inhibited by Sra1 , we anticipated that PCDH10 or , more precisely , WIRS binding would not be sufﬁcient to activate the WRC . As antic - ipated , neither the WIRS peptide nor the PCDH10 CT increased activity of the WRC toward the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . Somewhat unexpectedly , however , in the presence of subsaturating concentrations of Rac1 , PCDH10 CT enhanced the ability of Rac1 to stimulate WRC activity ( Figure 5B ) , suggesting that the two ligands can act cooperatively . When the WRC was satu - rated by higher concentrations of Rac1 , PCDH10 CT could not enhance activity further ( Figure 5B ) . These data suggest that PCDH10 CT may act by modestly shifting the autoinhibitory equilibrium of the WRC . Such a shift could facilitate activation by Rac1 while providing only minimal ( below measurement threshold ) activation on its own ( Buck et al . , 2004 ) . This cooper - ative activation is reminiscent of the coactivation of the WAVE relative , N - WASP , by Toca1 and the GTPase Cdc42 ( Ho et al . , 2004 ) . Notably , the minimal WIRS peptide had no effect on Rac1 stimulation , indicating that ﬂanking sequences in the PCDH10 CT are needed for this activity ( Figure 5A ) . Cell 156 , 195 – 207 , January 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 199 We further tested seven additional cytoplasmic tails from the above - veriﬁed WIRS proteins ( Figure 5C ) and found that they have different effects on activity of the WRC . The tails of PCDH19 and PCDH12 were able to enhance Rac1 - mediated WRC activation , similar to that of PCDH10 . The tails of the other proteins either had no effect on activity or were slightly inhibitory . These data suggest that the activity of WIRS ligands is variable , with some merely binding the WRC and others further modu - lating its activity . WIRS Ligands Bind the WRC In Vivo Having shown that WIRS proteins directly bind to the WRC using puriﬁed recombinant proteins , we tested whether this interaction also occurred between endogenous proteins . We found that Figure 4 . Many WIRS Proteins Bind the WRC ( A ) WIRSligandsthatbindWRCinpull - downassays with WIRS highlighted in orange . See Table S2 for references . ( B and C ) Coomassie - blue - stained gels show proteins selectively retained by immobilized 2MBP - D WRC ( WT for wild - type , AW for R106A / G110W - Abi2 ) . ( B ) showsveriﬁedcytoplasmictailsof WIRS proteins , and ( C ) shows false positive WIRS ligands . Arrows denote bound proteins . Asterisks indicate protein bound to the WRC independent of the WIRS interaction . GST - Rac1 - GMPPNP is a positive control . See also Table S2 . recombinant GST - PCDH10 CT can pull down endogenous WRC from mouse brain lysate ( Figure 6A ) , which is consistent with previous results ( Nakao et al . , 2008 ) . Addi - tion of the WT WIRS peptide ( WIRS WT ) in this reaction completely blocked the inter - action , whereas the peptide with a disrup - ted WIRS motif ( WIRS AA ) had no effect . Further , an antibody targeting the acidic region of the WAVE1 VCA could coimmu - noprecipitate WRC and full - length PCDH10 from mouse brain lysate ( Fig - ure 6B ) . As above , this interaction was weakened by the WIRS WT peptide but , to a lesser extent , by the mutant WIRS AA peptide ( Figure 6B ) . Thus , consistent with our in vitro results using recombinant proteins , the interaction between endoge - nous PCDH10 and endogenous WRC is WIRS dependent . We next examined whether PCDH10 could speciﬁcally recruit the WRC to the plasma membrane in cells . We engi - neered a chimeric transmembrane recep - tor composed of the extracellular domain of CD16 , the transmembrane domain of CD7 , the cytoplasmic tail of PCDH10 , and a C - terminal mCherry tag ( CD16 - CD7 - PCDH10 CT - mCherry ) ( Kolanus et al . , 1993 ) . This chimeric receptor was expressed in NIH 3T3 cells also stably expressing Sra1 - YFP . Dynal beads coated with anti - CD16 antibodies were then added to cluster the receptors at discrete regions where the beads contact the cells . Confocal images of beads that successfully recruited and clustered the chimeric receptors showed enrichment of mCherry tag ( Fig - ure 6C , red channel ) . At the same receptor - enriched regions , we observed signiﬁcantly greater corecruitment of the WRC ( Fig - ure 6C , green channel ) for the wild - type receptor tail than for the mutant tail in which the WIRS motif was disrupted ( Figures 6C and 6D ) . This is consistent with the previous observations by Nakao et al . ( 2008 ) that PCDH10 recruits the WRC to cell - cell contact sites . We also examined two other proteins using the same assay , PCDH17 and Neuroligin1 . The PCDH17 tail , which 200 Cell 156 , 195 – 207 , January 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . bindsthe WRC withsimilar afﬁnity as thePCDH10tail ( Figure S3 ) , exhibited similar WIRS - dependent recruitment of the WRC ( Figure 6D ) . The Neuroligin - 1 tail , which binds the WRC (cid:1) 20 fold more weakly than PCDH10 ( Figure S3 ) , also recruited the assembly but with less statistical certainty ( p = 0 . 10 , Figure 6D ) . Thus , we posit that WIRS ligands are sufﬁcient and necessary to recruit the WRC in cells . Mutating the WIRS - Binding Surface Disrupts Oogenesis in Flies To explore the physiologic functions of the WIRS / WRC inter - action , we used Drosophila oogenesis as a model system and investigated the consequences of disrupting the WIRS binding site of the WRC . Previous studies had revealed that normal oogenesis in Drosophila depends on the functions of the WRC and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Zallen et al . , 2002 ) . During oogenesis , Drosophila ovaries produce egg chambers , which progressively mature through 14 morphologically distinct stages to become eggs competent for fertilization ( Bastock and St Johnston , 2008 ; Bilder and Haigo , 2012 ; Hudson and Cooley , 2002b ) . An egg chamber is mainly occupied by one oocyte and 15 nurse cells interconnected by actin - rich cytoplasmic bridges termed ring canals . The nurse cells provide nutrients and macromole - cules for the oocyte through the ring canals . At the end of stage 10 , the nurse cells start to contract and squeeze the cytoplasmic contents into the oocyte , a process termed ‘‘dumping , ’’ which requires cytoplasmic actin bundles to form a basket - like struc - ture that prevents nuclei from clogging the ring canals . Disrup - tion of this ‘‘dumping’’ process results in female sterility as previously shown for wave and arp 2 / 3 complex mutants ( Hudson and Cooley , 2002a ; Zallen et al . , 2002 ) . We recently reported similar results of female sterility in zygotically rescued abi mutant ﬂies , which also displayed a characteristic dumpless egg mutant phenotype ( Zobel and Bogdan , 2013 ) . To determine whether the WIRS - binding surface of the WRC ( and thus potentially a WIRS / WRC interaction ) plays a role during this process , we attempted to rescue normal oogenesis and female fertility by generating transgenic ﬂies that re - expressed Abi WT or a mutant with a disrupted WIRS binding surface ( dAbi - AW ) in an abi mutant background using site - speciﬁc F C31 - mediated integration ( Bischof et al . , 2007 ) . To drive efﬁcient expression in the maternal germline , we speciﬁcally generated pUASp transgenes ( Rørth , 1998 ) . We found that ubiquitous re - expression ( da - Gal4 ) of dAbi - AW rescued the dumpless egg phenotype and female sterility ( as shown by reduction of offspring number ) with signiﬁcantly less efﬁciency than did re - expression of dAbi - WT ( Figures 7A and 7B ) . The incomplete rescue by dAbi - WT was likely due to the weak maternal expression of ubiquitous da - Gal4 driver ( Rørth , 1998 ) ( Figures 7A and 7B ) . To understand whythe dAbi - AW rescued eggs were defective , we examined maturing egg chambers and found obvious Figure 5 .

First , the majority of the dAbi - AW rescued egg chambers were smaller and aberrantly shaped , a phenotype characteristic of defects in ‘‘dumping’’ ( Figure 7C , middle ) ( Hudson and Cooley , 2002b ) . Occasionally , we also observed an opposite phenotype repre - sented by spherical but larger egg chambers ( Figure 7C , bottom ) ; this phenotype was similarly found for kugelei ( kug , fat 2 ) female sterile mutants , suggestive of defects in egg cham - ber elongation rather than in ‘‘dumping’’ ( Gutzeit et al . , 1991 ; Viktorinova´ et al . , 2009 ) . Second , independent of the egg cham - ber size , the cortical actin cytoskeleton in nurse cells was sub - stantially reduced , resulting in formation of multinucleated nurse cells ( Figure 7C , yellow arrows ) . Free - ﬂoating ring canals are often observed in such nurse cells as previously observed for wave mutants ( Figure 7C , magenta arrowheads ) ( Zallen et al . , 2002 ) . Finally , we observed even more severe defects in the actin cytoskeleton in older stages ( stage 10B ) when actin - myosin - mediated contraction drives the dumping of the remaining cytoplasmic contents from the nurse cells into the oocyte . High - resolution structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) re - vealed that the actin bundles were properly organized in majority of the dAbi - WT rescued egg chambers at stage 10B but were severely disorganized in dAbi - AW rescued egg chambers ( Fig - ure 7D ) , likely due to the aforementioned defects in the cortical actin cytoskeleton . Thus , we propose that the WIRS / WRC inter - action may regulate actin cytoskeletal organization during oogenesis and that disrupting the WIRS interaction site of the WRC results in defective egg morphology and female sterility . The general importance of the WIRS / WRC interaction in biology is further supported by our additional observation that Figure 6 .

In this system , the WRC functions non - cell autonomously to regulate photo - receptor neuron axon targeting ( Stephan et al . , 2011 ) . Taken together , our data suggest that the WIRS / WRC interaction could have diverse and essential functions throughout development . DISCUSSION We have identiﬁed a consensus peptide motif , WIRS , that specif - ically binds to a unique surface formed by the Sra and Abi subunits of the WRC . Strict conservation of the binding surface suggests that this interaction is broadly important to metazoans . The WIRS motif deﬁnes a novel class of WRC ligands that contains (cid:1) 120 diverse membrane proteins . Our genetic data further show that mutating the WIRS binding site of the WRC in Drosophila disrupts actin cytoskeleton organization and egg morphology during oogenesis , leading to female sterility , and also disrupts development of the visual system . In summary , our data characterize a widespread and conserved interaction that may link numerous membrane proteins to the WRC and the actin cytoskeleton . Molecular Implications of the WIRS / WRC Interaction The WIRS binding surface is contributed by both the Sra and Abi subunits of the WRC and therefore is only present in the fully assembled complex . Consequently , the WIRS interaction is unique to the intact WRC and cannot occur with individual subunits or subcomplexes . This may have important functional implications because , in cells , individual WRC subunits may form complexes with other proteins . For example , Sra1 binds the fragile - X mental retardation syndrome protein FMRP , along with the translation initiation factor eIF4E , using an interaction surface that is normally buried within the WRC ( Chen et al . , 2010 ; Napoli et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , Abi has been shown to interact with other proteins independent of its assembly into the WRC , including another member of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein WASP and the Diaphanous - related formin ( Bogdan et al . , 2005 ; Ryu et al . , 2009 ) . Finally , the Nap1 ortholog Hem1 was suggested to exist in large complexes distinct from the WRC ( Weiner et al . , 2006 ) . These various complexes likely have distinct cellular functions . For example , the Sra1 - FMRP - eIF4E complex regulates mRNA localization and protein transla - tion , and the Abi complexes were shown to regulate the actin cytoskeleton in processes distinct from those regulated by the WRC ( Bogdan et al . , 2005 ; Napoli et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , the multisubunit nature of the WIRS binding site may provide a mechanism to speciﬁcally regulate the intact WRC . WIRS proteins can directly recruit the WRC to membranes ( Figures 6C and 6D ) , likely in cooperation with the other classes of WRC ligands . WIRS proteins may also have additional effects on the biochemical activity of the WRC . For example , we have demonstrated that , although the minimal WIRS motif does not activate the WRC , sequences ﬂanking the motif can potentiate ( as in PCDH10 ) or inhibit ( as in PCDH17 ) activity of the WRC in vitro ( Figure 5 ) . Therefore , WIRS proteins may exert different effects on the activity of the assembly , again likely in cooperation with other WRC ligands such as Rac1 or kinases . Alternatively , WIRS proteins could act as a scaffold and modulate WRC activ - ity by coordinately recruiting the complex and other ligands . For example , the cytoplasmic tail of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B could potentially corecruit cyclin - dependent kinase 5 ( Cdk5 ) ( Hawasli et al . , 2007 ) and the WRC to facilitate phosphor - ylation and consequent activation of WAVE ( Kim et al . , 2006 ) . In fact , many WIRS - containing proteins are thought to function as scaffolds , including APC , Ankyrin , WTX / Amer1 , Shroom , and Shank . Finally , many WIRS proteins are cell - cell adhesion recep - tors , which are often densely clustered at the plasma membrane ( Hartman and Groves , 2011 ) . Such clustering would locally concentrate the WRC , a process known to increase the activity of WASP proteins toward the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Padrick et al . , 2008 ; Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ) . Finally , WIRS / WRC interactions themselves are likely regu - lated . In fact , our data suggest that the WIRS motif ( F - x - T / S - F - X - X ) could be modulated by phosphorylation . High - afﬁnity binding requires Thr or Ser at the third position of the WIRS motif . No other residues examined are tolerated ( Figure 1E ) . Thus , it is likely that Thr / Ser phosphorylation at this position would block binding as well . Indeed , phosphorylation of various WIRS sites has been identiﬁed not only in global phosphoproteome studies but also by site - speciﬁc mutagenesis ( Hornbeck et al . , 2012 ) ( Ta - ble S2 ) . Together , these various mechanisms could bring a large range of regulatory dynamics to locally tune WRC activity and consequent actin assembly in vivo . Evolutionary Implications of the WIRS / WRC Interaction The conservation of the WIRS binding surface in virtually all metazoans suggests that the WIRS / WRC interaction is broadly important and unique to animals because it is absent from other eukaryotes , including protists , fungi , and plants . It is notable that the WIRS binding surface is found even in nonmetazoan choano - ﬂagellates , suggesting that WIRS / WRC interactions appeared more than 700 million years ago in an early ancestor that predates metazoans . Choanoﬂagellates are considered to be the closest living relatives to metazoans because they encode many metazoan - speciﬁc protein domains , including various cell adhesion molecules and proteins enriched in the nervous system ( Burkhardt et al . , 2011 ; King et al . , 2008 ) . Although choa - noﬂagellates are generally considered unicellular organisms , they can form simple colonies ( Alegado et al . , 2012 ) , leading to the possibility that the WIRS interaction arose to maintain multicellularity . However , this interaction may not be strictly necessary for multicellularity , as the WIRS binding surface is not found in the placozoan T . adhaerens , a primitive , amoe - boid - like metazoan that lacks tissues or organs but is made up of distinct cell types ( Srivastava et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , a signif - icant number of nonadhesion proteins also contain WIRS motifs , indicating that the WIRS interaction likely developed additional functions . In this study , we have limited our search to proteins whose WIRS motifs were conserved in four of seven representative species . Among the (cid:1) 120 WIRS proteins , some display high conservation of their WIRS motifs . These include netrin recep - tors and ROBO proteins , whose WIRS motifs are conserved from human to C . elegans , despite a signiﬁcant divergence in Cell 156 , 195 – 207 , January 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 203 the overall sequences of their cytoplasmic tails . The WIRS motifs of many other proteins , including protocadherins and neuroli - gins , are conserved in all vertebrates examined ( from human to zebraﬁsh ) . We note that , by using conservation as a criterion in our search , we may have missed other bona ﬁde WIRS ligands that are less conserved . Physiologic Implications of the WIRS / WRC Interaction We have demonstrated biological functions of WIRS / WRC inter - actions in animals by using Drosophila oogenesis as a model system . Defects observed by disrupting the WIRS binding surface , which resulted in defective egg morphology , disrupted actin cytoskeleton , and female sterility , resemble defects that arise from knocking out the WRC ( Hudson and Cooley , 2002a ; Zallen et al . , 2002 ; Zobel and Bogdan , 2013 ) , suggesting that the WIRS interaction plays a major role in regulating WRC function during oogenesis in ﬂies . Additionally , we observed that the WIRS binding site is also important to the WRC in its non - cell - autonomous function of regulating photoreceptor axonal targeting in developing optic lobes ( Figure S4 ) ( Stephan et al . , 2011 ) . We believe that many more WIRS - mediated regu - latory functions are yet to be discovered . In support of this assertion , Shen and colleagues have recently shown that , in C . elegans , WIRS - mediated interaction of the neuronal adhe - sion receptor SYG - 1 with the WRC regulates actin assembly at presynaptic sites in the neuromuscular junction of the egg - laying motor neuron HSN and consequently is critical in initi - ating both synaptogenesis and axonal branching ( Chia et al . 2014 [ this issue of Cell ] ) . We propose that WIRS / WRC interac - tions are of general and diverse importance to animals throughout development . Future studies are needed to reveal which speciﬁc WIRS - containing ligands are important to particular processes . Prior data in the literature suggest candidate WIRS proteins during oogenesis . Two membrane - associated proteins , P08630 ( Tec29 tyrosine kinase ) and Q9VCX1 ( locomotion defects pro - tein , Loco ) , both contain WIRS motifs and have been shown to regulate nurse cell dumping ( Pathirana et al . , 2001 ; Roulier et al . , 1998 ) . Loco was also found to regulate the cortical actin cytoskeleton in glia ( Schwabe et al . , 2005 ) . Our phenotypic anal - ysis also reveals an opposite oogenesis defect , which is similar to those observed in kugelei mutants deﬁcient for dFAT2 , another WIRS - containing protein ( Gutzeit et al . , 1991 ; Viktori - nova´ et al . , 2009 ) . It remains to be determined whether these proteins or others are directly linked to the WRC during this process . A variety of evidence also exists in the literature , suggesting functional roles of the WIRS interaction in other biological processes . In addition to PCDH10 and PCDH19 , the WIRS proteins DCC and ROBO and the epithelial sodium channel ENaC ( g subunit ) have been genetically linked to the WRC . DCC and ROBO differentially regulate the abundance and sub - cellular localization of the WRC to control the actin cytoskeleton in C . elegans embryonic epidermis ( Bernadskaya et al . , 2012 ) . The WRC and Rac1 were found to be essential in regulating the activity of ENaC ( Karpushev et al . , 2011 ) . Our data suggest that these genetic interactions may be due to direct physical in - teractions of WIRS motifs with the WRC . The functions of many other WIRS proteins , only a few of which have been previously linked to the actin cytoskeleton ( e . g . , glutamate receptor NR2B and the postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule Neuroligin1 ) , may also depend on an interaction with the WRC . As a notable example , a 21 amino acid sequence of the Neuroligin1 cytoplasmic tail harboring a WIRS motif ( PGIQPLHT FNTFTGGQNNTLP , WIRS underlined ) is required for presynaptic terminal maturation ( Wittenmayer et al . , 2009 ) . Although it is still very premature to link WIRS / WRC inter - actions to any disease , several cases are suggestive ( Table S2 ) . For example , seven cases of epilepsy and mental retarda - tion in females ( EFMR ) were reported to arise from truncations of the cytoplasmic tail of PCDH19 , all resulting in the loss of its WIRS motif ( Dimova et al . , 2012 ) . Additionally , partial truncation of the DCC cytoplasmic tail , along with its WIRS motif , caused congenital mirror movement in four affected members of a three generation Italian family ( Depienne et al . , 2011 ) . Finally , a point mutation ( S1359C ) that disrupts the WIRS site ( LDSFES , S1359 underlined ) in the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) protein was associated with three unrelated cases of hepatoblastoma ( Oda et al . , 1996 ) . Conclusions In summary , we have deﬁned and characterized a large family of potential WRC ligands unique to metazoans . A large and diverse set of membrane proteins comprises this class , many with important biological functions . Our ﬁndings provide a mecha - nistic framework to understand how these proteins signal down - stream to the actin cytoskeleton via direct interaction with the WRC and how their mutations may ultimately lead to disease . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES DNA constructs and peptides used in this study are listed in the Extended Experimental Procedures ( Table S3 ) . Protein Puriﬁcation Recombinant WRCs were generated as previously described ( Chen et al . , 2010 ; Ismailet al . , 2009 ) . GST - tagged cytoplasmic tails of different transmem - brane receptors were puriﬁed by glutathione afﬁnity chromatography or followed by ion exchange and size exclusion chromatographies . Crystallography Crystals of WIRS / miniWRC complex were grown under similar conditions as was the apo miniWRC ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) except that the hanging drops also contained (cid:1) 2 . 6mMseleno - WIRSpeptide . Thestructurewassolvedbymolec - ular replacement from the structure of the apo miniWRC , using the program suite PHENIX ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) and Coot ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) . Final coor - dinates are available from the RCSB with accession code rcsb082839 ( PDB ID 4N78 ) . Biochemical Assays GSTorMBPpulldownwasperformedbymixingbaitproteinsand5 - to10 - fold excess ofprey proteins withthe corresponding afﬁnitybeads . After incubation and washing , the bound proteins were eluted with reduced glutathione or maltose , respectively . Pyrene - actin assembly assays were performed as previously described ( Ismail et al . , 2009 ) . Coimmunoprecipitation was per - formed by mixing mouse brain lysate with anti - WAVE1 monoclonal antibody ( Sigma ) and protein A / G beads in the presence of different competitors . The bound proteins were eluted by incubation with peptide A ( Table S3 ) and analyzed by SDS PAGE followed by western blotting . 204 Cell 156 , 195 – 207 , January 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . Cellular Assays The bead clustering experiment was performed using NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing Sra1 - YPet and transiently transfected with CD16 - CD7 - CT - mCherry chimeric receptors ( Kolanus et al . , 1993 ) . Receptors were clustered usingananti - CD16monoclonalmouseantibody ( Invitrogen ) followedbyDynal beads coated with sheep - anti - mouse IgG ( Invitrogen ) . Fixed cells were imaged using confocal microscopy along z stacks to ﬁnd the beads with en - riched mCherry signals and were blind scored for enriched Ypet signals . Drosophila Genetics and Immunohistochemistry Transgenic ﬂies were prepared as previously described ( Stephan et al . , 2011 ) . UASt - dAbi 68E and UASp - dAbi 68E wild - type and mutant transgenes were generated by F C31 - integrase - mediated integration into the landing site M { 3xP3 - RFP . attP’ } ZH - 68E ( Bischof et al . , 2007 ) . The abi inserts were sequencedandclonedintopUASTattBrfAandpUASPattBrfA ( Drosophila Ge - nomics Resource Center , DGRC ) , respectively , by LR in vitro recombination ( Invitrogen ) . Brains of third instar larvae were dissected , stained as previously described ( Stephan et al . , 2011 ) , and blind scored after 3D reconstruction of confocal ﬂuorescent images . Egg chambers from dissected ovaries were stained and imaged as previously described ( Bogdan et al . , 2005 ) . In fertility assays , twofemalesofeach genotypewere mated withthreewild - typemales . The number of offspring was counted after 15 days . Identiﬁcation of WIRS Proteins The annotated Swiss - Prot database ( Lane et al . , 2012 ) was searched for hu - man sequences containing the consensus WIRS motif ( [ FMWYIL ] - x - [ TS ] - [ F ] ) . The identiﬁed sequences were ﬁltered to retain those whose WIRS ( 1 ) was cytoplasmic and ( 2 ) resided in disordered regions . Proteins with WIRS motifs existing in less than four representative animal species ( human , mouse , chicken , frog , zebraﬁsh , Drosophila , and C . elegans ) were ﬁnally removed .
