Allen , 1 Michael L . Dustin 1 * The specialized junction between a T lymphocyte and an antigen - presenting cell , the immunological synapse , consists of a central cluster of T cell receptors surrounded by a ring of adhesion molecules . Immunological synapse formation is now shown to be an active and dynamic mechanism that allows T cells to distinguish potential antigenic ligands . Initially , T cell receptor ligands were engaged in an outermost ring of the nascent synapse . Transport of these complexes into the central cluster was dependent on T cell receptor—ligand interaction kinetics . Finally , formation of a stable central cluster at the heart of the synapse was a determinative event for T cell proliferation . A critical event in the initiation of the adaptive immune response is the activation of T lympho - cytes . This is mediated by the interaction of T cell antigen receptors ( TCRs ) with their li - gands , major histocompatibility molecule – pep - tide complexes ( MHC - peptide ) ( 1 ) . Within sec - onds of MHC - peptide engagement , the TCR initiates a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade that triggers multiple branching signaling pathways ( 2 ) . These early signals may be sufficient to trigger some effector functions , such as killer T cell execution of target cells . In contrast , more complex functions , such as T cell proliferation , require TCR engagement and signaling for many minutes or hours . The mechanisms of sustained TCR engagement are , however , not well understood . Sustained TCR engagement , although es - sential for T cell activation , faces many bar - riers . First , TCR engagement is impeded by the small size of the TCR and MHC mole - cules . Large , abundant glycoproteins like CD43 and CD45 impose a steric barrier to the interaction of TCR and MHC ( 3 ) . Second , the TCR has a low affinity for antigenic MHC - peptide ( 4 , 5 ) . Third , the number of antigenic complexes on the antigen - presenting cell ( APC ) can be very low ( 6 ) . Lastly , the move - ment of T cells works against sustained rec - ognition of antigen ( 7 ) . These barriers are active throughout the time the T cell interacts with the APC . MHC - peptide strength plays an important role in sustained signaling and T cell com - mitment . T lymphocytes display a remark - able ability to evaluate differences in MHC - peptide complexes . Alteration of a single amino acid in an antigenic peptide can have significant and distinct biological effects on the T cell ( 8 ) . Such altered peptide ligands can be classified as strongly activating ( ago - nist ) , weakly activating ( weak agonist ) , in - hibitory ( antagonist ) , or inactive ( null ) ( 4 , 5 ) . The wide range of biological activities dis - played by altered peptide ligands has been correlated with the half - life ( t 1 / 2 ) of the TCR – MHC - peptide interaction ( 4 , 5 ) . This dis - crimination process is evident in early signal - ing events such as the phosphorylation of the TCR z chain and recruitment of the kinase ZAP - 70 to the TCR ( 9 ) . It is not known how these early events are related to the sustained signals that determine T cell commitment . Initial views of antigen - specific T cell junc - tions have revealed the formation of a special - ized contact , termed the immunological syn - apse ( 10 , 11 ) . The mature immunological syn - apse is defined by a specific pattern of receptor segregation with a central cluster of TCRs sur - rounded by a ring of integrin family adhesion molecules ( 11 ) . We hypothesize that the forma - tion of the immunological synapse provides a mechanism for sustained TCR engagement and signaling . We now report real - time imaging and quan - titative analysis of the formation of a functional immunological synapse . We show that T cell activation is reconstituted by MHC - peptide and an adhesion ligand , ICAM - 1 , in a glass - sup - ported planar bilayer . Dynamic interactions were further probed by fluorescence photo - bleaching recovery to assess the stability of complexes formed within the synapse . This quantitative analysis has revealed that immuno - logical synapse formation is a multistage pro - cess and provides new insights into how MHC - peptide number and TCR - ligand interaction kinetics are translated into T cell activation decisions . MHC - Peptide Capture and Clustering in the Immunological Synapse We first examined the kinetics and pattern of MHC - peptide accumulation in T cell junctions to determine whether specific stages in the for - mation of immunological synapse could be dis - cerned . We used two different E k - restricted model antigen systems , moth cytochrome c ( MCC ) and hemoglobin ( Hb ) . Using two inde - pendent TCR systems permitted us to compare , contrast , and confirm key observations . To provide a T cell activating system for optimal imaging of molecular interactions in the T cell junction , we replaced the APC with planar bilayers containing fluorescently la - beled MHC - peptide and ICAM - 1 ( 12 ) . The purified MHC - peptide and ICAM - 1 were an - chored to the bilayer in a manner that allows their free diffusion in the supported bilayer [ Web movies 1 and 2 ( 13 ) ] and thus their free rearrangement upon interactions with cellular receptors ( 14 , 15 ) . T cells were prepared from 2B4 or 3 . L2 TCR transgenic mice ( 16 ) , and the time course of contact development be - tween a 2B4 T cell and the planar bilayer was observed ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) [ Web movies 3 to 6 ( 13 ) ] . The contact area was defined by interference - reflection microscopy ( IRM ) , which allows visualization of close mem - brane apposition as dark areas . Patterns of receptor interactions were defined by fluores - cence images of MHC - peptide ( E k - MCC88 - 103 ) ( green ) and ICAM - 1 ( red ) rearrange - ment . In the first 0 . 5 min , T cells stopped migrating and a broad central zone of ICAM - 1 accumulation was established . This central zone was bordered by a ring of close apposition of the T cell membrane and planar bilayer ( darkest area of IRM image ) that was free of accumulated ICAM - 1 . MHC - peptide engagement by the TCR was detected at the same time only in the outer , closely apposed ring of the junction . This orientation of accu - mulated MHC - peptide and ICAM - 1 was in - side - out compared with that defined for the mature immunological synapse . This periph - eral TCR engagement was clearly functional based on the concurrent increase in cytoplas - mic Ca 2 1 [ Web movie 7 ( 13 ) ] . Over the next 5 min , the engaged MHC - peptides moved to the center of the junction to form a central cluster . This mature immunological synapse was then maintained for over an hour ( Fig . 1 ) . Although the density of accumulated MHC - peptide and ICAM - 1 reached maximal levels in 10 to 20 min ( Fig . 1 , C and E ) , the largest number of MHC - peptide complexes were en - gaged within 5 min and many were lost dur - ing formation of the central cluster ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . The pattern of ICAM - 1 and MHC - peptide complex accumulation was not al - 1 Center for Immunology and the Department of Pa - thology , Washington University School of Medicine , 660 South Euclid Avenue , St .

MHC - peptide movement was in - hibited by cytochalasin D , an inhibitor of actin - based transport . These images and quantitative data illustrated two stages in the formation of an immunological synapse . Stage 1 is junction for - mation with engagement of MHC - peptide com - plexes in an outer ring , and stage 2 is the transport of the accumulated MHC - peptide complexes into the central cluster . Sensitivity of Central Cluster Formation To determine the relation between initial MHC - peptide density in the bilayer and the final density of MHC - peptide in clusters , we prepared bilayers with constant ICAM - 1 density and varied agonist MHC - peptide densi - ty ( 14 ) . Immunological synapse formation was compared at high ( Fig . 2 , A to E ) and low density ( Fig . 2F ) of MHC - peptide and with a null MHC - peptide ( Fig . 2G ) . Low and high densities of agonist MHC - peptide triggered for - mation of well - organized immunological syn - apses whereas , as expected , null MHC - peptide did not . Comparison of T cell proliferation and the density of agonist MHC - peptide complexes in the central cluster reveals that optimal pro - liferation was obtained over a wide range of initial MHC - peptide complex densities ( Fig . 2 , H and I ) . Thus , full T cell activation correlated with formation of an immunological synapse with a threshold density of $ 60 molecules per square micrometer of accumulated MHC - pep - tide complexes . Importantly , 0 . 2 molecules per square micrometer , the lowest density of ago - nist MHC - peptide complex that triggers prolif - eration and synapse formation , was the equiv - alent of 100 to 200 MHC - peptide complexes per APC , the minimum number of complexes needed to stimulate T cell interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) production ( 17 ) . Thus , stages 1 and 2 of immu - nological synapse formation did not require a high MHC - peptide dose and were observed over the same range of MHC - peptide densities required for T cell activation . MHC - Peptide Strength and Central Cluster Formation To determine whether MHC - peptide clustering was related to the strength of the MHC - peptide complex , we loaded E k with well - characterized altered peptides of MCC and Hb ( Table 1 ) and tested for proliferation and immunological syn - apse formation ( 18 ) . The pattern and density of MHC - peptide and ICAM - 1 accumulation were analyzed ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . Null MHC - peptide complexes ( N72E ) did not accumulate in the junctions , nor did they stop T cell migration [ Web movies 8 to 12 ( 13 ) ] . In contrast , all other antigen types ( agonist , weak agonist , and an - tagonist ) stimulated MHC - peptide accumula - tion ( Table 1 and Fig . 3 , A and B ) [ Web movies 8 to 12 ( 13 ) ] . Like strong agonists , the weak agonists in both systems formed immunological synapses as defined by the ICAM - 1 accumula - tion pattern , cessation of migration , and central clusters of accumulated MHC - peptide com - plexes ( Table 1 and Fig . 3 , A and B , N72T ) [ Web movies 8 to 12 ( 13 ) ] . However , the den - sity of MHC - peptide complexes accumulated in the central cluster was lower than with the strong agonist ligands ( Table 1 ) . Antagonist peptides slowed T cell migration and stimulated accumulation of MHC - peptide complexes at the junctions ( Table 1 ) . However , antagonist peptides ( N72I and N72A ) did not stop T cell migration and also did not form bona fide im - munological synapses , which would require a ring of ICAM - 1 accumulation around a central cluster of engaged MHC ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) [ Web movies 8 to 12 ( 13 ) ] . The density of clustered MHC - peptide complexes and the pro - portion of cells forming immunological syn - apses correlated with proliferation in the 3 . L2 ( Fig . 3C ) and 2B4 [ Web Fig . 2 ( 13 ) ] systems . To determine whether the amount of MHC - peptide accumulated in the contacts was related to TCR affinity , we plotted the density of ac - cumulated MHC - peptide complexes against each of the three intrinsic interaction parameters determined by surface plasmon resonance : the association constant ( K a ) , the on - rate ( k on ) , and the t 1 / 2 ( ln2 / k off ) . This was done for each of six ligands for which all data were available . The use of both the 2B4 and 3 . L2 systems revealed that the correlation of K a or k on with accumu - lated MHC - peptide density was significant within each system , but poor between the two systems ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) . In contrast , the correlation of t 1 / 2 and accumulated MHC - pep - tide density was strong both within and across the two distinct TCR systems ( Fig . 3F ) . Thus , stage 2 , MHC - peptide transport , is dependent on the t 1 / 2 of the TCR interaction with the MHC - peptide complex . Role of CD4 in Immunological Synapse Formation CD4 plays an important role in TCR signaling , but the nature of its contribution is not clear ( 19 ) . To address the role of CD4 , we capitalized on the fact that 3 . L2 transgenic T cells can develop in the absence of CD4 . CD4 - deficient 3 . L2 T cells were prepared from 3 . L2 TCR transgenic mice . Unlike their CD4 - positive Fig . 1 .

L2 T cells displayed weak proliferation in response to pla - nar bilayers containing ICAM - 1 and the agonist MHC - peptide complex as compared with nor - mal 3 . L2 T cells ( 20 ) . They were also much less efficient at stopping and forming immunologi - cal synapses ( Fig . 4 , B compared with A ) [ Web movies 13 to 15 ( 13 ) ] . CD4 - negative 3 . L2 T cells interacting with an agonist MHC - peptide complex appeared most similar to CD4 - positive 3 . L2 T cells on antagonist MHC - peptide com - plexes in the failure to stop migration and the concomitant lack of mature immunological syn - apses . Similar results were obtained by treating the CD4 - positive 3 . L2 cells with a function blocking antibody to CD4 before plating on a bilayer with ICAM - 1 and agonist MHC - peptide complexes ( Fig . 4C ) [ Web movies 13 to 15 ( 13 ) ] . Thus , CD4 increases the efficiency of stage 1 of immunological synapse formation , particularly the process of stopping migration . Dynamics of MHC - Peptide Clusters To examine the dynamics of interaction be - tween TCR and MHC - peptide complexes in the immunological synapse , we performed fluorescence photobleaching recovery ( FPR ) experiments ( 21 , 22 ) . We first established the intrinsic dynamics of the TCR – MHC - peptide interaction using Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells expressing glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) – anchored 2B4 TCRs with bilayers con - taining fluorescently labeled MHC - peptide com - plexes . The CHO cells formed contacts with the bilayer in which MHC - peptide complexes ac - cumulated throughout the contact area—for ex - ample , there was no evidence of active cluster - ing ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . FPR was performed with an argon laser beam after the accumulated MHC - peptide complex density in the contacts reached a steady state ( 23 ) . The bleached junc - tions recovered to initial levels with a t 1 / 2 of 5 min ( Fig . 5 , C and D ) . Because the only mech - anism for fluorescence recovery in the junction was for the accumulated MHC - peptide com - plexes to disengage from the TCR , the recovery time course provided a measure of molecular turnover in the junction . In contrast , a markedly different result was observed on MHC - peptide complexes accumulated in the organized immunological synapse formed by 2B4 T cells . Recovery was followed out to 400 s where recovery of . 60 % was anticipated on the basis of exper - iments with 2B4 TCR CHO cells . However , no clusters demonstrated any significant recovery in the T cell junctions . Greater than 80 % of clusters displayed no detect - able recovery at all ( Fig . 5 , E and F ) . The bleaching pulse had no apparent effect on the activity of the T cell or on LFA - 1 engagement as determined by parallel im - aging of normal membrane ruffling and ICAM - 1 accumulation . This suggested that MHC - peptide molecules in the central clus - Fig . 2 .

These data define a third stage in sustained TCR engagement that we will refer to as “stabilization . ” Discussion To address mechanisms of sustained TCR en - gagement and fidelity of T cell activation , we examined MHC - peptide accumulation in the immunological synapse using two different TCR systems . We identified three stages for TCR engagement during the formation of a stable immunological synapse : junc - tion formation , MHC - peptide transport , and stabilization ( Fig . 6 ) . These stages led to a likely end point for productive TCR en - gagement : the formation of a stable central cluster . Cluster stabilization was equivalent to formation of a stable immunological syn - apse . The threshold density of clustered MHC - peptide complexes in forming an im - munological synapse was 60 molecules per square micrometer . Having a higher density of MHC - peptide complexes in the central cluster did not correlate with increased T cell proliferation . This indicates that the important event for T cell commitment is the creation of the stable immunological synapse . Thus , synapse formation may be the ultimate ( final ) stage in which the TCR participates in T cell activation . Monks et al . ( 11 ) were the first to describe the orga - nization of the immunological synapse in fixed cells , but MHC - peptide movement and cluster stability can only be assessed using live cells . Thus , our studies reveal dimensions in the formation of the immu - nological synapse that were not evident in earlier static images . The Immunological Synapse Overcomes Barriers to Sustained TCR Engagement Sustained engagement faces several barri - ers that are overcome by formation of the immunological synapse . ( i ) The barrier of the small size of the TCR and MHC - pep - tide complexes in relation to large glyco - proteins is overcome by forcing a ring of T cell membrane against the substrate early in the synapse formation process . Close apposition was maintained as the captured MHC - peptide complexes were transported to the center of the synapse . ( ii ) The barrier of low affinity is overcome by the tight apposition of this ring of membrane to the substrate that confines the interaction to an attoliter ( 10 2 18 liter ) volume ( 24 ) . ( iii ) The barrier of rare MHC - peptide complexes is overcome by actively concentrating avail - able complexes by greater than 100 - fold in the center of the synapse . This concentra - tion may have been accomplished by active cytoskeletal transport of engaged TCRs that associate with the actin cytoskeleton after interaction with MHC - peptide com - plexes ( 25 ) . The concentration of MHC - peptide complexes in the central cluster may also drive formation of TCR – MHC - peptide oligomers that could account for the cluster stabilization stage ( 5 , 26 ) . ( iv ) Finally , the barrier of T cell migration is overcome by the cytoskeletal organization that is an integral part of synapse forma - tion . Directed migration is dependent on the formation of temporary attachments to the substrate that are moved rearward by the actin cytoskeleton ( 27 ) . In contrast , the organization of the immune synapse is ra - dially symmetric and inward directed , such that force vectors cancel and the cells re - Fig . 3 .

Thus , the immunological synapse organization is synonymous with the antigen - dependent stop signal ( 28 ) . MHC - Peptide Clustering Has Fidelity to Early Kinetic Discrimination Processes Our data also support a role for the immuno - logical synapse in the discrimination of po - tential antigenic ligands by the TCR . The TCR exhibits an exquisite specificity for its antigen as demonstrated by the significantly different biological outcomes induced by li - gands that differ by only a single amino acid . Examination of TCR interaction with MHC - peptide by a panel of altered peptide ligands showed a direct relationship between the pro - cess of immunological synapse formation and T cell proliferation . Furthermore , all densities of agonist MHC - peptide complexes that in - duced T cell proliferation also triggered a central cluster with greater than or equal to 60 molecules per square micrometer of accumu - lated MHC - peptide complexes . As the num - ber of accumulated MHC - peptide complexes was “locked in” in the final stage of immu - nological synapse formation , the T cell could thus set a specific threshold to determine whether to commit to the program of T cell activation . Given the discrete temporal stages of im - munological synapse formation , one possible mechanism for T cell discrimination of ligands is based on kinetic models ( 29 ) . Consistent with a kinetic model of T cell activation , we found that the t 1 / 2 of the TCR – MHC - peptide interac - tion correlates with the number of MHC - pep - tide complexes in the cluster . One process that may contribute to kinetic discrimination is the recruitment of p56 lck to the engaged TCR by CD4 . The time required to recruit CD4 to the engaged TCR may provide a kinetic window that determines the ability of antigenic pep - tide complexes to trigger early signals . In contrast , there is no evidence that CD4 par - ticipates directly in stabilizing the TCR – MHC - peptide interaction ( 30 ) . The formation of a cluster of MHC - peptide complexes , the size of which is determined by early kinetic discrimination , provides a link between early signaling and later T cell commitment . These aspects of MHC - peptide strength that determine TCR sensitivity may not only be restricted to kinetics . Although the t 1 / 2 of the MHC - peptide complex strongly correlat - ed with central cluster formation and biolog - ical response , it is possible that MHC - pep - tide – induced conformational change in the TCR may also be important ( 31 ) . A few MHC - peptide complexes can acti - vate a T cell through a process that consumes up to 100 TCRs for each MHC - peptide com - plex ( 32 ) . This observation is the basis of the “serial engagement” model for T cell activa - tion . Our results are consistent with these data , although we do not directly examine the movement or down - regulation of the TCR . We find that more MHC - peptide complexes are initially captured than are eventually in - corporated into the cluster ( Fig . 1 ) . On this basis , we speculate that the transport process that moves the MHC - peptide complexes is a barrier to cluster formation and that multiple TCRs may be consumed in the process of transporting a single MHC - peptide complex from the outer ring of the junction to the central cluster . This is consistent with the ob - servation that the transport of MHC - peptide complexes from the outer ring to the central Fig . 4 .

Thus , it is reasonable that it might take several TCRs , engaged in a serial manner , to move the MHC - peptide complexes the re - quired distance of ; 5 m m . We nevertheless propose that serial engagement is not an end point where TCRs are spent only in exchange for a transient signal . We show that engaged TCRs are invested in building the stable central cluster . The size of the central cluster relative to a threshold value would then determine longer - term events such as T cell proliferation . This quantitative analysis reveals how the formation of an immunological synapse pro - vides the machinery to integrate cell surface events into the T cell activation decision . Cen - tral cluster formation is based on a transport process sensitive to MHC - peptide strength and number . The intrinsically transient interaction of TCR and MHC - peptide complex is stabi - lized in the immunological synapse . The MHC - peptide complex must be of sufficient density and potency to attain the stable central cluster , to fully activate the T cell . Thus , building an immunological synapse provides a high - order molecular mechanism to assess MHC - peptide strength with respect to three stages of synapse formation : junction formation ( stopping ) , MHC - peptide transport , and cluster stabilization .

E k - GPI and ICAM - 1—GPI expressed in CHO and BHK cells were solubilized by probe sonication with buffered 1 % Triton X - 100 and were captured on 14 - 4 - 4 or YN1 / 1 agarose , respectively . Proteins were labeled with Oregon green and Cy5 for E k - GPI and ICAM - 1 ( Molec - ularProbesandAmersham ) . LabeledE k - GPIandICAM - 1 were eluted at high pH and were individually reconsti - tuted in phosphatidylcholine ( egg ) vesicles ( 33 ) . Molec - ular density was determined by immunoradiometric assays . Iodinated 14 - 4 - 4 and YN1 / 1 were used for E k - GPI and ICAM - 1—GPI , respectively . 13 .

We prepared planar bilayers by mixing the E k - GPI and ICAM - 1—GPI liposomes 1 : 1 before incubating them on clean glass ( 33 ) in a parallel - plate (cid:223)ow cell ( Bioptechs ; Butler , PA ) . The E k - GPI was loaded with peptides over 48 hours at 37¡C ( 34 ) . Loading of E k - GPI with MCC88 - 103 was directly assessed with the D4 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) speci(cid:222)c to this MHC - peptide complex ( 35 ) . Lower densities of ago - nist - loaded complexes were generated by mixing in the appropriate null peptide while keeping the total peptide concentration at 100 m M . Cells were injected into the warmed ( 37¡C ) (cid:223)ow cells at time zero and then (cid:223)ow was stopped for the duration of the exper - iment . Thus , any cell movement ( migration ) is active . The bilayers were imaged as described ( 23 ) . 15 . MHC - peptide complexes and ICAM - 1 are laterally mobile on APCs ( 10 , 36 ) . Regulation of lateral mo - bility of MHC - peptide complexes by cytoskeletal in - teractions augments some T cell responses , but is not essential for T cell activation ( 36 ) . 16 . Splenocytes from 2B4 TCR transgenic mice were cultured with 1 m M MCC88 - 103 peptide for 3 days . The cells were then expanded in media with IL - 2 ( 100 U / ml ) and used on day 7 . CHO cells expressing GPI - anchored 2B4 TCRs were cultured as described ( 37 ) . Splenocytes from 3 . L2 TCR transgenic mice , with or without CD4 , were depleted of CD8 - positive cells by using magnetic beads ( Dynal , Great Neck , NY ) and stimulated with 1 m M Hb64 - 76 peptide . The 3 . L2 CD4 2 / 2 TCR transgenic cells are selected on the H - 2 k haplotype in the thymus , and normal numbers of mature T cells emerge in the periphery . The pe - ripheral cells were either CD8 1 , which were depleted here , or double - negative cells , and both populations expressed the clonotypic TCR . 17 . C . V . Harding and E . R .

The cluster was exposed to a brief laser pulse to irreversibly bleach the (cid:223)uorophores , and the images were acquired with the cooled charge - coupled device camera . The recovery process is a function of both the kinetic rates for the receptor - ligand interaction and the ratio of accumulated (cid:223)uorescence to the density of free ligand molecules in the bilayer . Thus , these were matchedbetweensystemstobecompared . Thespeci(cid:222)c cluster (cid:223)uorescence intensity at a given time ( I t 5 cluster intensity 2 bilayer intensity ) divided by the (cid:223)uorescence intensity of ligands in the bilayer ( I b ) was plotted against time ( 23 , 38 ) . 23 .

FPR showed that 20 % of the 50 , 000 TCRs on 2B4 T cells were laterally mobile . Our analysis considers only mobile TCRs ( 39 ) . We assume that the surface area of the T cell is 500 m m 2 .

Side view of T cell forming an immunological syn - apse with an APC . Stage 1 : Junction for - mation . LFA - 1 anchors the central region of the nascent immuno - logical synapse , pro - viding a fulcrum for cytoskeletal protrusive mechanisms that force an outermost ring of T cell membrane into close apposition with the substrate . This allows TCR sampling of MHC - peptide complexes . Early signals from the TCR and CD4 stop migration . Stage 2 : MHC - peptide transport . This transport process required ; 5 min . We speculate that this is mediated by actin - based trans - port mechanisms . Stage 3 : Stabilization . The clustered MHC - peptide com - plexes were (cid:210)locked - in(cid:211) by an unknown mechanism . The organization of molecules after stage 3 is identical to that reported by Monks et al . ; however , they referred to the central cluster as a c - SMAC and the ring of LFA - 1 as a p - SMAC ( 11 ) . We include these domains in the de(cid:222)nition of the immunological synapse , which we observe as a central cluster within two concentric rings . The intermediate ring is enriched in LFA - 1—ICAM - 1 com - plexes , whereas the outermost ring of close membrane apposition lacks LFA - 1 / ICAM - 1 complexes , but promotes ef(cid:222)cient TCR—MHC - peptide inter - action in the nascent synapse .

Records measured along two ice cores from Summit in Central Greenland provide information about variations in atmo - spheric N 2 O concentration in the past . The record covering the past millennium reduces the uncertainty regarding the preindustrial concentration . Records covering the last glacial - interglacial transition and a fast climatic change during the last ice age show that the N 2 O concentration changed in parallel with fast temperature variations in the Northern Hemisphere . This provides important information about the response of the environment to global climatic changes . Nitrous oxide ( N 2 O ) is an atmospheric trace gas with a relatively long lifetime of about 120 years ( 1 ) . The main sources of N 2 O in preindustrial times have been tropical soils , the ocean in upwelling regions , and soils in temperate regions ( estimated contributions are 45 , 30 , and 25 % , respectively , but with high uncertainties ) ( 1 ) . The main sink is pho - todissociation in the stratosphere ( 1 ) . The atmospheric concentration of this greenhouse gas [ which , apart from water vapor , is third in importance after carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) and methane ( CH 4 ) ] reached 314 parts per billion by volume ( ppbv ) in 1998 ( 2 ) and increases by about 0 . 25 % per year ( 1 ) . Knowledge about the atmospheric N 2 O concentration be - fore 1976 comes mainly from ice core anal - yses ( 3 – 7 ) . Our record covering the past mil - lennium allows us to narrow the range of the preindustrial concentration . Records of CH 4 variations parallel to cli - matic oscillations have provided a wealth of information about the global significance of climatic oscillations and about the response of the environment to such variations ( 8 – 10 ) . Like CH 4 , N 2 O has an important source in the tropics [ wet forest soils and dry savannahs for N 2 O ; wetlands for CH 4 ( 1 ) ] , but in contrast to CH 4 it has an important oceanic source too . Therefore , we expect that our measurements , which cover time periods of drastic climate changes , will provide new information about environmental responses to those changes . We present examples from the last glacial - interglacial transition [ 16 . 5 to 10 . 5 thousand years before the present ( kyr BP ) ] and from a fast climate oscillation during the last ice age ( 37 . 0 to 32 . 5 kyr BP ) . The air trapped in polar ice samples was extracted with the melt - refreezing method used for CH 4 analyses ( 10 , 11 ) . The N 2 O concentra - tion of the extracted air was measured with a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector . Tests with bubble - free ice and standard gas ( the working standard was 304 6 4 ppbv ) confirmed that N 2 O can be extracted with the melt - refreezing method despite the high solubility of N 2 O in water ( 12 ) , if the freezing speed is kept low . The small sample size ( about 40 g ) allowed us to measure several samples per annual layer for samples from this millennium as well as one sample per annual layer for the transition from the last glacial epoch to the Holocene . Data presented in this study are not corrected for gravitational frac - tionation ( 13 ) . Samples for the first measurement series , covering the past 1000 years ( Fig . 1 ) , are from cores drilled at Summit ( central Green - land , 72°34 9 N , 37°38 9 W ) as part of the EU - ROCORE project and the Greenland Ice Core Project ( GRIP ) . The preindustrial N 2 O con - centration was relatively stable , with an av - erage of 270 6 5 ppbv for the time period between 1400 and 1750 A . D . Previously pub - lished data ( 3 – 6 ) are highly scattered and allow only a rough estimate of the preindus - trial concentration of between 260 and 285 ppbv ( Fig . 1 ) . An exception are the precise results by Machida et al . ( 7 ) covering the past 300 years . The low scatter of our measure - ments and the good agreement with the mea - surements by Machida et al . , which were performed with a dry extraction technique , as well as the good agreement with the direct measurements on atmospheric air ( 14 ) and firn air measurements from Antarctica ( 15 ) , indicate that our measurements for this time period are reliable and allow us to investigate changes in the atmospheric N 2 O concentration that occurred together with climatic changes in past climate epochs . In Fig . 2 , the N 2 O record for the transition period from the last glacial epoch to the Holo - cene measured along the GRIP ice core is com - pared with the GRIP records of oxygen isotope d 18 O ( 16 ) ( used as a proxy for temperature ) and CH 4 ( 8 , 17 ) . The N 2 O concentration increased 1 Climate and Environmental Physics , Physics Institute , University of Bern , Sidlerstrasse 5 , CH - 3012 Bern , Switzerland . 2 CNRS Laboratoire de Glaciologie et Ge«ophysique de l(cid:213)Environnement ( LGGE ) , Boı(cid:246)te Post - ale 96 , 38402 St Martin d(cid:213)He‘res Cedex , Grenoble , France . * Present address : Princeton University , Princeton , NJ 08544 , USA . † To whom correspondence should be addressed .
