The Theory of Planned Behavior ( TPB ) predicts an individual ' s intention to engage in a behavior at a specific time and place . It posits that individual behavior is driven by behavior intentions , where behavior intentions are a function of three determinants : an individual’s attitude toward behavior , subjective norms , and perceived behavioral control ( Ajzen , 1991 ) . Key Concepts and Dimensions Behavioral Intention This is a proxy measure for behavior . It represents a person ' s motivation in the sense of her or his conscious plan or decision to perform certain behavior ( Conner & Armitage , 1998 ) . Generally , the strong the intention is , the more likely the behavior will be performed . Attitude toward Behavior This refers to the degree to which a person has positive or negative feelings of the behavior of interest . It entails a consideration of the outcomes of performing the behavior . Subjective Norm This refers to the belief about whether significant others think he or she will perform the behavior . It relates to a person’s perception of the social environment surrounding the behavior . Perceived Behavioral Control This refers to the individual’s perception of the extent to which performance of the behavior is easy or difficult ( Ajzen , 1991 ) . It increases when individuals perceive they have more resources and confidence ( Ajzen , 1985 ; Hartwick & Barki , 1994 ; Lee & Kozar , 2005 ) Academic Technology Services A Division of Information Technology Services Memorial Library , Room 3010 • Mankato , MN 56001 Phone 507 - 389 - 6654 ( V ) • 800 - 627 - 3529 711 ( MRS / TTY ) • Fax 507 - 389 - 6115 An Affirmative Action / Equal Opportunity University . Adapted from ( Ajzen , 1991 ) Measurements Developing a measure utilizing the Theory of Planned Behavior is highly dependent upon the topic being considered . Measures should assess all main components of the theory : attitude toward behavior , subjective norms , perceived behavioral control , and intention . Typical measures follow a Likert - style format and can range in length from a few succinct questions to much longer and more comprehensive surveys . The article below describes how to construct a TPB questionnaire : ● Ajzen , I . Constructing a theory of planned behavior questionnaire .

This instrument assessed major constructs of TPB , as well as several sections dealing with such issues as general and racial self - esteem , academic self - efficacy , neighborhood living conditions , and after - school activities . ● The second paper described a conceptual model , based on the TPB , which explained how college students’ beliefs influence their intention to adopt mobile devices in their coursework . The questionnaire used in this research contained 30 items and measured the participants ' perceptions with a 7 - point Likert scales . The questionnaire can be found in Appendix A of the paper ( Cheon et . al . , 2012 ) . References 1 . Ajzen , I . ( 1985 ) . From intentions to action : a theory of planned behavior . In J .
