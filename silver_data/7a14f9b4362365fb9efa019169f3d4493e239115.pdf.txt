Whereas the mechanisms for both AEA biosynthe - sis and metabolism are fairly well established , the manner by which AEA is accumulated into cells remains controversial . The overwhelming majority of scientific reports indicate that this lipid neuromodulator is taken into cells via a facilitated process . Some reports have suggested that AEA uptake occurs by facilitated diffusion . Recent evidence indicates that AEA uptake may occur via endocytosis , contesting the premise that passive diffusion is the mechanism by which AEA transverses the plasma membrane .

The Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology , Purdue University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences , West Lafayette , Indiana , USA 25 introduction to the endocannabinoid field with an emphasis on the various proposed mechanisms for the cellular uptake of endocannabinoids and other related hydrophobic molecules . I . AEA and the Endocannabinoid System A . Discovery of endocannabinoids The psychotropic properties and medicinal uses of marijuana have been long - known . However , it was not until the 1970s that the plant’s active ingredient , D 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , was discovered ( Gaoni and Mechoulam , 1971 ) . For years , the mechanism by which THC exerts its physiological and psychoactive effects escaped scientists , until the discovery of the cannabinoid receptors , CB 1 and CB 2 , in the early - 1990s ( Matsuda et al . , 1990 ; Munro et al . , 1993 ) . These groundbreaking discoveries led to another—the identifi - cation of an endogenous CB receptor lipid ligand termed AEA ( Devane et al . , 1992 ) . Almost 20 years later , AEA remains under intense scientific investiga - tion . In addition , several other endocannabinoids have also been identified , including 2 - arachidonylglycerol ( 2 - AG ) ( Mechoulam et al . , 1995 ; Sugiura et al . , 1995 ) , virodhamine ( Porter et al . , 2002 ) , and noladin ether ( Hanus et al . , 2001 ) ( Fig . 2 . 1 ) . Below , we will focus on the endocannabinoid AEA , broadly covering its metabolism and signaling , and more specifically , the mechanism by which it is accumulated in cells . B . AEA synthesis AEA is the most well - characterized endocannabinoid . Unlike typical neu - romodulators , AEA is not presynthesized and stored in synaptic vesicles . Rather , the most generally accepted hypothesis is that AEA is synthesized NH NH 2 OH OH OH O O O O O O OH OH AEA 2 - AG Virodhamine Noladin Ether Figure 2 . 1 Endogenous cannabinoids . 26 Marla L . Yates and Eric L . Barker on - demand in a Ca 2 þ - dependent manner via N - archidonylphosphatidy - lethanolamine ( NAPE ) phospholipase D ( PLD ) ( Cadas et al . , 1997 ; Di Marzo et al . , 1994 ) . First , NAPE is formed by the transfer of an N - archidonyl group to a phosphatidylethanolamine moiety , although the precise enzymes involved in this process are currently under debate ( Jin et al . , 2007 ) . Then , upon demand , AEA is synthesized from its precursor NAPE . Originally , the cleavage of NAPE to AEA was thought to occur via the Ca 2 þ - dependent phospholipase D activity of NAPE - PLD . Yet , even though the recently cloned NAPE - PLD ( Okamoto et al . , 2004 ) is capable of generating AEA from NAPE , studies using NAPE - PLD - null transgenic mice indicate that this may not be the dominant enzyme responsible for AEA biosynthesis ( Leung et al . , 2006 ) ( for a recent review of this topic , see Okamoto et al . ( 2007 ) ) . In addition , other calcium - independent mechan - isms for AEA biosynthesis have been proposed ( Liu et al . , 2006 ; Simon and Cravatt , 2008 ; Vellani et al . , 2008 ) . C . AEA signaling Regardless of the precise mechanisms responsible for its biosynthesis , AEA is released into the extracellular space , where it is known to act on the cell - surface CB 1 and CB 2 receptors ( Felder et al . , 1993 ; Munro et al . , 1993 ) , among other potentially distinct targets ( Mackie and Stella , 2006 ) . AEA also acts as an endogenous agonist for the transient receptor potential vanilloid type - 1 ( TRPV1 ) receptor ( De Petrocellis et al . , 2001 ; Ralevic et al . , 2001 ; Ross , 2003 ; Smart et al . , 2000 ; Zygmunt et al . , 1999 ) . CB1 and CB2 receptor signaling . The cannabinoid receptors ( CB 1 and CB 2 ) are seven - transmembrane ( 7TM ) G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) that are predominantly coupled to G a i / o ( Matsuda et al . , 1990 ) , the inhibitory G protein subunit , but have also been shown to couple with G a s ( Jarrahian et al . , 2004 ) and G a q ( Lauckner et al . , 2005 ) . Activation of these receptors leads to dissociation of the G a i / o subunit from the G bg subunits , subsequent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase ( AC ) via G a i / o , and downregulation of cAMP production . CB 1 receptors are predominantly localized to the central nervous system ( CNS ) where AEA is released from postsynaptic neurons and signals in a retrograde fashion to bind CB 1 receptors located on the presynaptic axon termini ( Leung et al . , 2006 ) . CB 1 receptor activation leads to the opening of inwardly rectifying K þ channels ( Mu et al . , 1999 ) , closing of T - , N - , and P / Q - type voltage - gated Ca 2 þ channels ( Caulfield and Brown , 1992 ; Lovinger , 2008 ; Mackie and Hille , 1992 ; Twitchell et al . , 1997 ) , and the activation of various protein kinases ( Howlett , 2005 ) . Such anandamide - stimulated CB 1 receptor signaling controls the presynaptic release of neu - rotransmitters such as gamma - aminobutryic acid ( GABA ) , glutamate , and acetylcholine [ reviewed by Freund et al . ( 2003 ) and Lovinger ( 2008 ) ] . Organized Transport of AEA and Related Lipids 27 Unlike CB 1 receptors , the majority of CB 2 receptors are expressed in the periphery ( Klein et al . , 2000 ; Munro et al . , 1993 ) . Their activation does not modulate ion channel activity , but does lead to activation of protein kinases ( Guindon and Hohmann , 2007 ; Howlett , 2005 ) . Such CB 2 receptor sig - naling regulates the immune response , as well as fertility ( Huffman and Marriott , 2008 ; Klein et al . , 2000 ; Maccarrone , 2007 ) . Interestingly , a role for CB 2 receptors in the CNS has also recently been proposed ( Guindon and Hohmann , 2007 ) . However , the exact location and signaling events associated with these apparent nonperipherally localized CB 2 receptors is still under investigation . TRPV1 receptor signaling . AEA also has activity at the TRPV1 receptor , a member of the TRP family of ion channels ( Caterina et al . , 1997 ; Ralevic et al . , 2001 ; Ross , 2003 ; Smart et al . , 2000 ; Zygmunt et al . , 1999 ) . The TRPV1 receptor is a ligand - gated Ca 2 þ - permeable nonselective cation channel that is activated by multiple noxious stimuli , including heat , pro - tons , and capsaicin ( Caterina et al . , 1997 ) . AEA interacts with an intracellu - lar binding site on TRPV1 , stimulating channel activation and Ca 2 þ influx ( De Petrocellis et al . , 2001 ) . AEA - stimulated TRPV1 activation regulates the pain response , circulatory effects , and locomotor skills ( Ralevic et al . , 2002 ; Starowicz et al . , 2007 ) . Currently , the rationale for AEA activation of both TRPV1 and CB1 receptors , which seemingly elicit opposing signaling pathways , is unknown . D . AEA degradation FAAH - 1 and FAAH - 2 . Following uptake into cells , AEA is rapidly broken down into the metabolites arachidonic acid and ethanolamine via fatty acid amide hydrolase ( FAAH ) . Two human FAAH isoforms , which share approx - imately 20 % sequence identity , have been identified and are referred to as FAAH - 1 and FAAH - 2 , respectively ( Cravatt et al . , 1996 ; Wei et al . , 2006 ) . Both FAAH - 1 and FAAH - 2 are members of the large and varied amidase signature ( AS ) family of proteins ( Cravatt et al . , 1996 ; McKinney and Cravatt , 2005 ; Wei et al . , 2006 ) . Members of this family share a long stretch of sequence similarity known as the amidase signature . However , despite the conserved AS domain , a very diverse group of molecules is substrates for AS family member proteins ( McKinney and Cravatt , 2005 ) . When comparing the FAAH isoforms , both degrade primary fatty acid amides with equal activity ( Wei et al . , 2006 ) . Yet , FAAH - 1 has greater activity with regard to fatty acid taurines and fatty acid ethanolamides ( Wei et al . , 2006 ) . Although most AS family members are soluble proteins , both FAAH enzymes are integral membrane proteins that contain a single transmem - brane domain on their N - termini ( Cravatt et al . , 1996 ; Wei et al . , 2006 ) . We and others have used immunocytochemistry to localize FAAH to an 28 Marla L . Yates and Eric L . Barker intracellular location in , or around , the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( Giang and Cravatt , 1997 ; McFarland et al . , 2006 ) . However , the proposed orienta - tion of these two enzymes within the ER membrane is different ( Wei et al . , 2006 ) . The C - terminal catalytic domain of FAAH - 1 has been reported to have a cytoplasmic orientation as compared to FAAH - 2 , which exposes its C - terminus to the ER lumen ( Wei et al . , 2006 ) . Such altered arrangements of the FAAH enzymes within the membrane could be indicative of their respective substrate pools within a cell , however , this has yet to be determined ( Wei et al . , 2006 ) . Further comparisons reveal that the expression pattern of the two FAAH isoforms varies among tissues and across species ( Wei et al . , 2006 ) . FAAH - 1 has been cloned from various species , including humans , rats , and mice , whereas FAAH - 2 is apparently not expressed in murids ( McKinney and Cravatt , 2005 ; Wei et al . , 2006 ) . Throughout human tissues , FAAH - 1 and FAAH - 2 have similar expression levels overall , except that FAAH - 2 is the isoform predominantly expressed in the heart , whereas FAAH - 1 is prefer - entially expressed in the brain , testis , and small intestine ( Wei et al . , 2006 ) . E . Lipid rafts and the fate of AEA metabolites We have found that following AEA uptake and metabolism , the AEA metabolites arachidonic acid and ethanolamine are trafficked to caveolae or caveolin - rich membrane ( CRM ) domains ( McFarland et al . , 2004 ) ( Fig . 2 . 2 ) . Caveolae / CRM domains are specialized microdomains within the plasma membrane that are enriched in cholesterol , sphingomylein , arachidonic acid , plasmenylethanolamine , and the protein caveolin and are considered a subset of lipid rafts ( Brown and London , 2000 ; Pike et al . , 2002 ) . Because of their ordered structure relative to the rest of the plasma membrane ( Brown and London , 2000 ) , these microdomains are continually implicated in various cellular roles , such as the organization of proteins involved in various signal transduction pathways , including CB 1 receptor signaling ( Dainese et al . , 2007 ) . AEA metabolites can theoretically be used to form NAPE , the precursor to AEA , and thus , these CRM microdomains might serve as ‘‘warehouses’’ for on - demand AEA biosynthesis . Indeed , our group has previously reported that caveolae / CRM domains may serve as platforms for the biosynthesis of AEA , and potentially other endocannabinoids ( McFarland et al . , 2006 ) . When caveolae / CRM domain organization is disrupted , Ca 2 þ ionophore - stimulated AEA synthesis is decreased , indicating the potential importance of these microdomains in the biosynthesis of AEA ( Placzek et al . , 2008 ) . Additionally , NAPE - PLD and diacylglycerol - lipase , the respective major biosynthetic enzymes responsible for AEA and 2 - AG production , have been localized to CRM fractions ( Rimmerman et al . , 2007 ) . Organized Transport of AEA and Related Lipids 29 Taking into account the above data , one can propose the following model for AEA biosynthesis and degradation ( Fig . 2 . 3 ) : Following uptake , AEA is shuttled to the intracellularly localized FAAH , where it is degraded . The resulting metabolites arachidonic acid and ethanolamine are re - esterified and then shuttled to caveolae / CRM domains , where they are transformed into NAPE . Upon demand , NAPE is cleaved , and AEA is released into the extracellular space . Such a model is further supported by the localization of NAPE - PLD and diacylglycerol - lipase , the respective major biosynthetic enzymes responsible for AEA and 2 - AG production , to CRM fractions ( Rimmerman et al . , 2007 ) . In addition to potentially serving as the platform for endocannabinoid biosynthesis , our lab recently demonstrated a role for caveolae / CRM domains in the protein - mediated endocytic uptake of AEA ( McFarland et al . , 2004 , 2008 ) . This topic will be covered in more detail below . First , however , we will address why a lipophilic molecule , such as AEA , might 3000 A B C P M / m g p r o t e i n C P M / m g p r o t e i n 2000 1000 Fraction Fraction 1000 750 500 250 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Figure 2 . 2 Following uptake and catabolism by FAAH , the AEA metabolites arachi - donic acid and ethanolamine are trafficked to lipid rafts / caveolae .

The second fraction contains the detergent - resistant CRM domains / caveolae ( ▲ ) . The effect of the uptake inhibitor AM404 ( 100 m M ) ( ▪ ) and the FAAH inhibitor methyl arachidonyl fluoropho - sphonate ( 250 nM ) ( ▼ ) on the trafficking of AEA metabolites is also shown . Figure taken from McFarland et al . ( 2004 ) . 30 Marla L . Yates and Eric L . Barker require a specific protein - mediated uptake mechanism for efficient passage across the cell plasma membrane . II . AEA Transport Although the mechanisms for AEA biosynthesis , signaling , and degra - dation are relatively well defined , there is a great deal of controversy surrounding the process ( es ) controlling AEA transport across the cell mem - brane . Several hypotheses have been proposed over the years , including a model of passive diffusion ( Fasia et al . , 2003 ; Glaser et al . , 2003 ; Kaczocha Plasmamembrane Caveolae Transportinhibitors Intracellularmembrane Endocytosis AEA AEA AEA A E A Eth Eth E t h AA AA AA F A A H F AA H Figure 2 . 3 The caveolae - related endocytic uptake and trafficking of AEA metabolites to plasma membrane CRM domains . AEA binds a putative carrier protein located within plasma membrane caveolae . Following caveolae - related endocytosis , AEA is trafficked to the intracellularly localized FAAH enzyme . There , AEA is broken down into the metabolites arachidonic acid ( AA ) and ethanolamine ( Eth ) . The AEA metabolites are then trafficked back to the caveolae / CRM domains via an unknown mechanism , where they are possibly stored for the on - demand biosynthesis of new AEA molecules . Organized Transport of AEA and Related Lipids 31 et al . , 2006 ) . However , the majority of data suggest that AEA uptake is a protein - facilitated process ( Di Marzo et al . , 1994 ; Fegley et al . , 2004 ; Hillard et al . , 1997 ; Ligresti et al . , 2004 ; Maccarrone et al . , 2000 ; McFarland et al . , 2004 , 2008 ; Ortega - Gutierrez et al . , 2004 ; Rakhshan et al . , 2000 ) . We will focus on the evidence supporting the protein - facilitated uptake of AEA here including our own data that suggest a caveolae - related endocytic process for the cellular accumulation of AEA ( McFarland et al . , 2004 , 2008 ) . First , though , we will briefly explore the protein - mediated mechanisms respon - sible for transporting other extracellular lipids and long - chain fatty acid molecules , similar to AEA , across the plasma membrane . A . Fatty acid transporters Long - chain fatty acids are used by all cell types in various physiological processes and are emerging as potential modulators of specific diseases , including cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and obesity ( Bonen et al . , 2004 ; Coort et al . , 2007 ; Hamilton , 2007 ; Schwenk et al . , 2008 ) . However , besides lipogenic tissues ( liver , adipose tissue , lactacting mammary gland ) , all other cell types must obtain their fatty acids from exogenous sources , including cardiac tissue and muscle ( Jia et al . , 2007 ) . Hence , extracellular fatty acids must be capable of crossing the plasma membrane . After the fatty acid enters the cell , it is either activated by thioesterification to acetyl Co - A immediately at the membrane ( vectorial acylation ) ( Kampf and Kleinfeld , 2007 ; Watkins , 1997 ) or is shuttled to intracellular organelles and activated there ( Hamilton , 2007 ; Kampf and Kleinfeld , 2007 ; Zimmerman and Veerkamp , 2002 ) . Once activated , the cell can then use the fatty acid molecule in various metabolic pathways ( Jia et al . , 2007 ) . Previously , there has been debate as to whether long - chain fatty acids cross the cell membrane via a specific mechanism or by passive diffusion ( Bonen et al . , 2007 ; Doege and Stahl , 2006 ) . However , it is now believed that specific protein - mediated transport mechanisms do exist for the cellular accumulation of long - chain fatty acid molecules ( Abumrad et al . , 1998 ) . Two individual proteins and an entire protein family have emerged as potential key regulators of fatty acid transport across the plasma membrane : the plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein ( FABPpm ) , the fatty acid translocase ( FAT / CD36 ) , and the fatty acid transport protein ( FATP ) family ( Bonen et al . , 2007 ; Chabowski et al . , 2007 ; Doege and Stahl , 2006 ) . Whether these proteins work independently or in concert to transport fatty acids is unclear and controversial ( Bonen et al . , 2007 ; Chabowski et al . , 2007 ; Doege and Stahl , 2006 ) . Here , we will briefly review these established fatty acid transporters to set a precedent for the premise that AEA , a long - chain fatty acid ethanolamide , crosses the membrane via a protein - mediated process , rather than by simple diffusion . 32 Marla L . Yates and Eric L . Barker Plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein . FABPpm was the original reported candidate for the fatty acid transporters . This approximately 40 kDa protein , originally discovered by Stremmel and colleagues ( 1985 ) , is a peripheral membrane protein that has since been found to be identical to the mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase ( mAspAt ) ( Berk et al . , 1990 ; Isola et al . , 1995 ) . Apparently , this protein has different functions depending on its cellular localization to either the plasma membrane or mitochondria ( Holloway et al . , 2007 ) . Although the precise mechanism is unclear , there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that FABPpm plays a role in fatty acid transport ( Berk et al . , 1990 , 1997 ; Heather et al . , 2006 ; Isola et al . , 1995 ; Stump et al . , 1993 ; Turcotte et al . , 1999 ; Zhou et al . , 1995 ) . The assignment of a protein as a fatty acid transporter is based on several criteria ( Hui and Bernlohr , 1997 ) , and FABPpm has been observed to meet these criteria ( Berk et al . , 1990 , 1997 ; Heather et al . , 2006 ; Isola et al . , 1995 ; Stump et al . , 1993 ; Turcotte et al . , 1999 ; Zhou et al . , 1995 ) : ( 1 ) localization to the plasma membrane , ( 2 ) a selective and reversible high affinity for fatty acids , ( 3 ) an increase in saturable fatty acid transport during overexpression of the protein , and ( 4 ) a decrease in fatty acid transport after treatment with antibodies or siRNA targeting the protein . FABPpm localizes to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and is not a member of the cytosolic fatty acid binding protein ( FABP ) family , which at first , may be implied due to the name ( Stump et al . , 1993 ; Zhou et al . , 1995 ) . Overexpression of FABPpm in Xenopus laevis oocytes and in NIH - 3T3 fibroblasts in both cases corresponded to an increase in saturable fatty acid transport ( Isola et al . , 1995 ; Zhou et al . , 1992 ) . Likewise , alterations in the expression levels of FABPpm seem to generally correlate with the levels of fatty acid uptake required by different cell types ( Berk et al . , 1997 ; Heather et al . , 2006 ; Turcotte et al . , 1999 ) although changes in protein expression are not necessarily always propor - tionate to fatty acid transport ( Chabowski et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , treat - ment of cells with FABPpm - recognizing antibodies inhibits long - chain fatty acid uptake selectively ( Berk et al . , 1990 ; Zhou et al . , 1995 ) . Fatty acid translocase ( FAT / CD36 ) . The heavily glycosylated fatty acid translocase ( FAT ) was cloned by Abumrad and colleagues in 1993 , and was determined to have 85 % sequence similarity with the class B scavenger receptor protein CD36 ( Abumrad et al . , 1993 ) . Whereas FAT / CD36 has various cellular functions ( Febbraio et al . , 2001 ; Holloway et al . , 2008 ) , the protein has repeatedly been shown to also play a role in the translocation of fatty acids across the plasma membrane ( Abumrad et al . , 1999 ; Bonen et al . , 2007 ; Febbraio et al . , 2002 ; Rac et al . , 2007 ) . We will focus on that function here . Similar to FABPpm , FAT / CD36 meets the criteria defining a fatty acid transporter ( Abumrad et al . , 1999 ; Bonen et al . , 2007 ; Febbraio et al . , 2002 ; Hui and Bernlohr , 1997 ; Rac et al . , 2007 ) . FAT / CD36 has been isolated to Organized Transport of AEA and Related Lipids 33 the plasma membrane of various cell types and is believed to contain two transmembrane domains ( Rac et al . , 2007 ) . Recently , the cytoplasmic C - terminus was implicated in the localization of FAT / CD36 to the plasma membrane as well as the protein’s FAT activity ( Eyre et al . , 2007 ) . Both in vitro and in vivo studies show a positive correlation between expression levels of the 88 kDa FAT / CD36 and saturable and selective long - chain fatty acid uptake in adipocytes and myocytes [ reviewed by Abumrad et al . ( 1999 ) , Bonen et al . ( 2007 ) , Febrraio et al . ( 2002 ) ] . Treatment of cells with long - chain fatty acids increased FAT / CD36 expression , possibly via PPAR g - mediated transcriptional events ( Sfeir et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , treatment of human peripheral mono - nuclear blood cells with AEA , a proposed PPAR g agonist ( Bouaboula et al . , 2005 ; O’Sullivan , 2007 ) , was recently shown to increase CD36 mRNA and protein expression ( Malfitano et al . , 2007 ) . Such findings may indicate a role for FAT / CD36 in the uptake of AEA although to our knowledge , no detailed reports investigating this premise exist at this time . Fatty acid transport protein ( FATP ) family . Within the solute carrier family 27 ( SLC27 ) of proteins , there are six mammalian isoforms of fatty acid transport proteins ( FATPs1 – 6 ) , which are apparently identical to the six members of the very long - chain acyl - CoA synthetase ( VLACS ) protein family ( Jia et al . , 2007 ) . While FATPs are thought to participate in fatty acid transport , their roles are controversial and not well defined . FATPs are integral membrane proteins that contain one or more amino - terminal transmembrane domains ( Lewis et al . , 2001 ; Schaap et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , these family members contain two cytoplasmic - facing motifs found within the approximately 300 amino acid - long FATP signature sequence : an adenosine triphosphate / adenosine monophosphate ( ATP / AMP ) motif and an FATP / VLACS motif ( Stahl , 2004 ; Stahl et al . , 2001 ) . The ATP / AMP motif is important for both ATP binding and fatty acid transport whereas the FATP / VLACS motif is believed to be involved solely in fatty acid transport ( DiRusso et al . , 2008 ; Stahl , 2004 ; Stahl et al . , 2001 ; Stuhlsatz - Krouper et al . , 1998 , 1999 ) . The individual FATPs exhibit differ - ential tissue - and species - specific expression patterns , and this topic has been covered in more detail in several reviews Bonen et al . ( 2007 ) , Doege and Stahl ( 2006 ) , Ehehalt et al . ( 2006 ) , Stahl ( 2004 ) , Stahl et al . ( 2001 ) . FATPs have been characterized as FATPs based upon the observations that fatty acid transport increases with FATP expression levels and that these overexpressed proteins are localized at the plasma membrane ( DiRusso et al . , 2005 ; Ehehalt et al . , 2006 ; Stahl , 2004 ) . However , it was recently shown that overexpressed FATPs display cellular localizations distinct from their endogenous counterparts ( Jia et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , there is now debate as to whether these proteins are associated with the plasma membrane or the membrane of intracellular organelles ( Jia et al . , 2007 ; Pei et al . , 2004 ) . Obviously , if FATPs truly act as fatty acid ‘‘transporters , ’’ they must localize 34 Marla L . Yates and Eric L . Barker to the plasma membrane in native cells . The lack of such evidence has prompted some researchers to question what role , if any , that FATPs play in fatty acid transport ( Doege and Stahl , 2006 ; Jia et al . , 2007 ) . The fatty acyl CoA synthetase activity of FATP family members has stirred additional debate regarding the mechanism by which FATPs pro - mote fatty acid transport . As mentioned earlier , FATPs are apparently identical to the VLACS protein family members ( Jia et al . , 2007 ) and have long - and very long - chain ( i . e . , fatty acid chains > 18 carbons ) fatty acyl CoA synthetase activity ( Coe et al . , 1999 ; DiRusso et al . , 2005 ; Pei et al . , 2004 ) . This intrinsic enzyme activity , rather than serving an actual transporter function , has been proposed to be responsible for the FATP - driven translocation of fatty acids across the plasma membrane ( Jia et al . , 2007 ; Pohl et al . , 2004 ; Stahl , 2004 ) . The acylation of intracellular fatty acids prevents them from crossing the plasma membrane and reentering the extracellular space ( Watkins , 1997 ) . Therefore , FATPs could be promoting fatty acid transport , not by physically transporting the molecules across the membrane , but rather by essentially altering the concentration gradient along which the molecules move ( Ehehalt et al . , 2006 ) . The FATPs may ‘‘remove’’ the activated fatty acids from the intracellular pool of inactivated fatty acids that defines the concentration gradient driving the influx of inactivated fatty acids ( Ehehalt et al . , 2006 ) . Yet , in contrast to this hypothesis , several studies have recently used yeast overexpression studies to demonstrate that the acyl CoA synthetase activity of FATPs is distinguishable from their transport function ( DiRusso et al . , 2005 , 2008 ; Pei et al . , 2004 ) . B . Lipid transfer proteins StAR - related lipid transfer ( START ) protein family . The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein ( StAR ) - related lipid transfer ( START ) domain protein family is a class of proteins involved in the intracellular transfer of hydro - phobic ligands between membranes ( Soccio and Breslow , 2003 ; Wirtz , 2006 ) . In humans , there are 15 START domain protein family members ( StARD1 – 15 ) comprising six START domain subfamilies . Every START protein contains one C - terminal START domain con - sisting of approximately 210 amino acid residues ( Ponting and Aravind , 1999 ) . The structure of the START domain consists of a ‘‘helix - grip fold’’ comprised of a central nine - stranded antiparallel incomplete b - barrel sur - rounded by long N - terminal and C - terminal a - helices ( a 1 and a 4 ) in addition to two shorter a - helices ( a 2 and a 3 ) ( Iyer et al . , 2001 ; Tsujishita and Hurley , 2000 ) . The ligand - binding site lies within a hydrophobic tunnel composed of the b - sheet and a - helices 2 , 3 , and 4 ( Alpy and Tomasetto , 2005 ) . The C - terminal portion of the START domain ( a 4 ) may act as a lid atop this hydrophobic tunnel and appears to play an essential role in START domain function ( Alpy and Tomasetto , 2005 ; Arakane Organized Transport of AEA and Related Lipids 35 et al . , 1996 ; Feng et al . , 2000 ) . In addition to this START domain , different subfamily members contain other functional domains , including the Rho - GAP or thioesterase domains ( Alpy and Tomasetto , 2005 ; Soccio and Breslow , 2003 ) . While not verified , it has been suggested that the function of START proteins containing such additional domains is regulated in a lipid - dependent manner using the START domain as a ‘‘lipid sensor’’ ( Alpy and Tomasetto , 2005 ) . There are many proposed models for how START proteins transfer lipids from one membrane to another ( Alpy and Tomasetto , 2005 ; Miller , 2007 ) . However , most data regarding the original START protein , StAR , support a model whereby this protein transports cholesterol to the mito - chondria by acting exclusively at the outer mitochondrial membrane ( Alpy and Tomasetto , 2005 ; Miller , 2007 ) . Alpy and Tomasetto ( 2005 ) have thus applied this mechanism of action to the entire START protein family . In their model , a START protein accepts a lipid ligand by opening its C - terminal lid and dipping into a membrane source ( plasma , organelle , etc . ) ( Alpy and Tomasetto , 2005 ) . Once the lid closes , the START protein releases from the donor membrane , travels to another membrane , and then transfers the lipid to that acceptor membrane via the reverse of the above process ( Alpy and Tomasetto , 2005 ) . In addition , they note that while START proteins have only been reported to donate their lipid ligands to membrane acceptors , it is possible that they may also transfer lipids to protein acceptors , as well ( Alpy and Tomasetto , 2005 ) . C . Characteristics of AEA transport AEA accumulation has been observed in a wide variety of neuronal and nonneuronal cell types , including primary cortical neurons ( Di Marzo et al . , 1994 ; Ortega - Gutierrez et al . , 2004 ) , mouse Cath . a - differentiated ( CAD ) neuronal cells ( McFarland et al . , 2008 ) , primary rat cerebellar granule cells ( Hillard et al . , 1997 ) , rat basophilic leukemia ( RBL - 2H3 ) cells ( Ligresti et al . , 2004 ; Rakhshan et al . , 2000 ) , rat C6 glioma cells ( Ligresti et al . , 2004 ) , HeLa cells ( Day et al . , 2001 ) , 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes ( Thors et al . , 2007 ) , human endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) ( Maccarrone et al . , 2000 ) , two prostate cancer cell lines ( PC - 3 and R3327 AT - 1 ) ( Thors et al . , 2007 ) , and the intact retina ( Glaser et al . , 2005a ) . Many of these studies have character - ized AEA uptake as a rapid and saturable process that is temperature - dependent and independent of energy in the form of either ATP or ion gradients ( Di Marzo et al . , 1994 ; Fegley et al . , 2004 ; Hillard et al . , 1997 ; Ligresti et al . , 2004 ; Maccarrone et al . , 2000 ; McFarland et al . , 2008 ; Ortega - Gutierrez et al . , 2004 ; Rakhshan et al . , 2000 ) . Furthermore , there appears to be a structural requisite for AEA uptake ( reviewed by Reggio and Traore ( 2000 ) ) , and AEA accumulation can be pharmacologically inhibited , although the precise protein target ( s ) of these inhibitory compounds is 36 Marla L . Yates and Eric L . Barker unclear ( Fowler et al . , 2004 ) . Overall , such characteristics correspond well with a process of facilitated diffusion . However , despite there being a general consensus that AEA uptake occurs via a facilitated process ( Di Marzo et al . , 1994 ; Fegley et al . , 2004 ; Hillard et al . , 1997 ; Ligresti et al . , 2004 ; Maccarrone et al . , 2000 ; McFarland et al . , 2004 , 2008 ; Ortega - Gutierrez et al . , 2004 ; Rakhshan et al . , 2000 ) , there is debate regarding the exact proteins involved ( Hillard and Jarrahian , 2003 ) . In addition , other researchers have offered an alternative , passive diffusion - based model for AEA uptake ( Fasia et al . , 2003 ; Glaser et al . , 2003 ; Kaczocha et al . , 2006 ) . Below , we will summarize the various proposed models for the cellular accumulation of AEA . D . Proposed models for cellular AEA accumulation Passive diffusion model for AEA uptake . While the majority of studies charac - terize AEA uptake as a facilitated process ( Di Marzo et al . , 1994 ; Fegley et al . , 2004 ; Hillard et al . , 1997 ; Ligresti et al . , 2004 ; Maccarrone et al . , 2000 ; McFarland et al . , 2004 , 2008 ; Ortega - Gutierrez et al . , 2004 ; Rakhshan et al . , 2000 ) , a few studies have concluded that AEA crosses the plasma membrane via passive diffusion ( Fasia et al . , 2003 ; Glaser et al . , 2003 ; Kaczocha et al . , 2006 ) . These researchers suggest a model where no membrane protein carrier exists , but rather movement of AEA across the membrane is merely driven via its metabolism by FAAH and / or its sequestration by other intracellular binding proteins ( Fasia et al . , 2003 ; Glaser et al . , 2003 ; Kaczocha et al . , 2006 ) . Hillard and colleagues have suggested a model of intracellular AEA sequestration that simultaneously supports the passive diffusion of AEA across the cell membrane while explaining the characteristics of AEA uptake that are consistent with a process of facilitated diffusion ( Hillard and Jarrahian , 2003 ) . In this model , extracellular AEA can cross the plasma membrane along the concentration gradient un - aided by any protein carrier ( Hillard and Jarrahian , 2003 ) . Once across , AEA is believed to bind intra - cellular binding proteins and is thus removed from the pool of ‘‘free AEA , ’’ allowing for maintenance of the concentration gradient ( Hillard and Jarrahian , 2003 ) . In this hypothesis , AEA uptake would be saturated only once there are no available intracellular binding proteins . This model for the sequestration of intracellular AEA has been supported by observations that , at equilibrium , the intracellular concentration of AEA is actually higher than that in the extracellular space ( Deutsch et al . , 2001 ; Hillard and Jarrahian , 2000 ; Rakhshan et al . , 2000 ) . However , to our knowledge , there are no reports identifying a specific intracellular binding protein that plays a role in the AEA uptake process . Furthermore , although this model describes AEA uptake as a passive diffusion process , Hillard and colleagues do not refute the Organized Transport of AEA and Related Lipids 37 possible existence of a plasma membrane - localized protein carrier in certain cell types ( Hillard and Jarrahian , 2003 ) . Kaczocha et al . ( 2006 ) have proposed an alternative passive diffusion model for AEA uptake . They suggest that any saturating effects observed during initial AEA uptake are the result of the permeation of AEA through an unstirred water layer surrounding cells . These authors propose that the movement of AEA through this water layer around cells can mimic char - acteristics of facilitated transport when measured via standard kinetic assays ( Bojesen and Hansen , 2003 ; Kaczocha et al . , 2006 ) . As was discussed by Glaser et al . ( 2005b ) much of the contention between the facilitated and passive diffusion models for AEA uptake stem from the varying protocols used to study the process . The time points at which AEA uptake is measured seem to influence the characterization of the transport process as either a facilitated or passive diffusion event . Recently , a few reports have shown that initial AEA uptake kinetics are linear , and thus , suggest passive diffusion of AEA across the plasma membrane ( Glaser et al . , 2003 ; Kaczocha et al . , 2006 ; Sandberg and Fowler , 2005 ) . In these studies , researchers measured AEA uptake at time points less than 1 min ( Glaser et al . , 2003 ; Kaczocha et al . , 2006 ; Sandberg and Fowler , 2005 ) , as opposed to experiments determining steady - state uptake kinetics at time points ranging anywhere from 5 min to 40 h ( Dickason - Chesterfield et al . , 2006 ; Fegley et al . , 2004 ; Maccarrone et al . , 2000 ; McFarland et al . , 2008 ; Moore et al . , 2005 ; Rakhshan et al . , 2000 ) . It was argued that at early time points under 1 min , FAAH has not yet begun to metabolize AEA and therefore cannot influence transport or interfere with the analysis of AEA uptake kinetics ( Glaser et al . , 2003 ; Kaczocha et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , these initial measurements may better represent the mechanism by which extracellular AEA crosses the plasma membrane . However , in contrast to the results of these studies , not all measurements of initial AEA uptake ( time points < 5 min ) correspond to a model of passive diffusion ( Ligresti et al . , 2004 ) . Ligresti and colleagues ( 2004 ) found that at low concentrations , AEA uptake is saturable within 90 s in both RBL - 2H3 and C6 glioma cell lines , as well as in mouse brain synaptosomes from both wild - type and FAAH (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . Such discrepant results suggest that either AEA uptake is mediated by cell type - specific mechanisms or that the experimental variability within the assays has led to potentially artifactual results in some , or all , studies . Another source of experimental variability that has created debate regarding the mechanism for AEA uptake is the presence or absence of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in the assay buffer ( Glaser et al . , 2005b ) . Due to its lipophilic nature , AEA has a tendency to adhere to the extracellular cell surface and also to the plastic tissue culture plates most often used for the transport assays ( Karlsson et al . , 2004 ; Ligresti et al . , 2004 ; Ortega - Gutierrez et al . , 2004 ) . BSA is known to bind AEA ( Bojesen and Hansen , 2003 ) , but 38 Marla L . Yates and Eric L . Barker its use in uptake assays to prevent the nonspecific binding of AEA to plasticware and cells has been widely debated . Although the use of BSA in assay buffer does seem to affect AEA uptake ( Di Marzo et al . , 1994 ; Karlsson et al . , 2004 ; Ligresti et al . , 2004 ; Ortega - Gutierrez et al . , 2004 ) , Glaser et al . ( 2003 ) eloquently noted in a recent review that these results are interpreted very differently . Some researchers believe that BSA interferes with and prevents AEA uptake ( Di Marzo et al . , 1994 ; Ligresti et al . , 2004 ) and thus , choose to eliminate it from assay buffers . Yet , others insist that assays conducted in the absence of BSA result in artifactual data that support the mistaken characterization of AEA uptake as facilitated process ( Karlsson et al . , 2004 ; Ortega - Gutierrez et al . , 2004 ) . Karlsson et al . ( 2004 ) and Ortega - Gutierrez et al . ( 2004 ) demonstrated that not only does AEA bind to the wells of plastic tissue culture plates , but also this binding is temperature - dependent and blocked by supposed AEA uptake inhibitors in a dose - dependent manner , thus potentially mimicking a protein - facilitated uptake event . Today , there appears to be no clear resolution to the dilemma regarding the various protocols used to measure AEA uptake , whether concerning the inclusion of BSA in assay buffers or at what time points to measure AEA transport . Therefore , these issues remain as points of both internal and external conflict among many researchers in the field . Facilitated processes for AEA uptake . Whereas , as described above , there is some evidence to suggest a model of passive diffusion for AEA uptake , the vast majority of data suggest that AEA crosses the plasma membrane via a process of facilitated diffusion mediated by a specific , but unidentified protein ( Di Marzo et al . , 1994 ; Fegley et al . , 2004 ; Hillard et al . , 1997 ; Ligresti et al . , 2004 ; Maccarrone et al . , 2000 ; McFarland et al . , 2004 , 2008 ; Ortega - Gutierrez et al . , 2004 ; Rakhshan et al . , 2000 ) . At first , it may seem as though a lipophilic molecule such as AEA should not require additional assistance to cross the plasma lipid bilayer . However , as was summarized in the previous section , it is generally accepted that many lipids and fatty acid molecules are transported across the cell membrane via a protein - mediated event ( Abumrad et al . , 1998 ) . Yet , even those in agreement about a model of facilitated diffusion for AEA uptake debate the exact mechanism by which the protein - mediated process occurs . Some have argued for the existence of a plasma membrane - localized carrier protein that helps AEA transverse the plasma membrane ( Day et al . , 2001 ; Deutsch et al . , 2001 ; Hillard and Jarrahian , 2000 , 2003 ; Hillard et al . , 1997 ; Ligresti et al . , 2004 ; Rakhshan et al . , 2000 ) , whereas others have suggested an intracellular AEA - binding protein distinct from FAAH ( Fegley et al . , 2004 ; Hillard and Jarrahian , 2003 ; Hillard et al . , 2007 ) . Alternatively , our lab has demonstrated that AEA uptake can be mediated by a caveolae - related endocytic event ( McFarland et al . , 2004 , 2008 ) . Below , we will discuss these variations on the facilitated diffusion model proposed to explain AEA uptake . Organized Transport of AEA and Related Lipids 39 There is evidence to suggest that the movement of AEA across the plasma membrane is bidirectional , indicating the existence of a plasma membrane - localized carrier protein ( Gerdeman et al . , 2002 ; Hillard and Jarrahian , 2000 ; Hillard et al . , 1997 ; Ligresti et al . , 2004 ; Maccarrone et al . , 2002 ) . Several different cell lines , including cerebellar granule cells ( Hillard et al . , 1997 ) , human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) ( Maccarrone et al . , 2002 ) , and striatal neurons ( Gerdeman et al . , 2002 ) , are capable of AEA efflux . In HEK - 293 cells , the release of de novo biosynthe - sized AEA is significantly decreased by the AEA uptake inhibitor VDM11 ( Ligresti et al . , 2004 ) . Additionally , AEA transport has been shown to exhibit the trans effect of flux coupling ( Hillard and Jarrahian , 2000 ) . During this phenomenon , carrier proteins accumulate and orient themselves toward the extracellular space in response to accumulating intracellular AEA ( Hillard and Jarrahian , 2000 ) . Thus , AEA can be transported against the concentration gradient without requiring energy ( Hillard and Jarrahian , 2000 ) . However , the intracellular sequestration of AEA by a binding protein ( Hillard and Jarrahian , 2003 ) , a model described earlier , could also account for the observation that intracellular AEA concentrations can exceed those in the extracellular space ( Hillard and Jarrahian , 2003 ) . Initially , the synthesis and characterization of specific AEA uptake inhi - bitors further supported the model whereby AEA uptake occurred via a membrane - localized protein carrier ( Fig . 2 . 4 ) . However , it has since been determined that nearly all of these ‘‘specific’’ AEA uptake inhibitors also inhibit FAAH activity , to one extent or another ( Alexander and Cravatt , 2006 ; Dickason - Chesterfield et al . , 2006 ; Hillard et al . , 2007 ) . This revela - tion has created much debate as to whether such inhibitory compounds exert their effects via targeting of the putative transporter , FAAH , or both [ for a review of this topic , see Fowler et al . ( 2004 ) ] . Hence , such questions have led researchers to investigate the role that FAAH plays in AEA uptake . AEA uptake is driven by , but not necessarily dependent upon , FAAH activity ( Day et al . , 2001 ; Deutsch et al . , 2001 ; Fegley et al . , 2004 ; Hillard et al . , 2007 ; Ligresti et al . , 2004 ) . It is clear that FAAH activity stimulates AEA transport , presumably by maintaining the concentration gradient between the extracellular and intracellular AEA pools ( Day et al . , 2001 ; Ligresti et al . , 2004 ) . Overexpression of FAAH in mammalian cells enhances AEA uptake ( Day et al . , 2001 ) . These results are consistent with those from studies comparing AEA uptake in cells from transgenic FAAH (cid:2) / (cid:2) versus wild - type mice ( Ligresti et al . , 2004 ) . However , FAAH does not appear to be the only protein driving AEA uptake . For instance , although AEA uptake is heightened in wild - type mice , cells from FAAH (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice still display saturable and pharmacologically inhibitable AEA accumulation ( Fegley et al . , 2004 ; Ligresti et al . , 2004 ) . Likewise , our lab has found that HeLa cells , which are devoid of endogenous FAAH activity , still accumu - late AEA in a manner consistent with facilitated diffusion ( Day et al . , 2001 ) . 40 Marla L .

Organized Transport of AEA and Related Lipids 41 Furthermore , Hillard and colleagues ( 2007 ) have reported that while ‘‘specific’’ AEA uptake inhibitors inhibit FAAH activity , the associated reduction in AEA accumulation is not solely due to their prevention of AEA hydrolysis . Such data suggest that another protein , or group of proteins , is also responsible for mediating AEA uptake . Our lab has proposed a protein - mediated caveolae - related endocytic model for the cellular accumulation of AEA ( McFarland et al . , 2004 , 2008 ) . This model is consistent with the aforementioned hypotheses concerning the facilitated uptake of AEA as well as the intracellular seques - tration model put forth by Hillard and colleagues ( Hillard and Jarrahian , 2003 ; McFarland et al . , 2004 , 2008 ) . We have shown that the disruption of caveolae / CRM domain formation by the cholesterol - depleting compounds nystatin and progesterone inhibited AEA uptake by approximately 50 % in the RBL - 2H3 cell line ( McFarland et al . , 2004 ) ( Fig . 2 . 5 ) .

AEA uptake was assessed in RBL - 2H3 cells treated to inhibit caveolae - related endocytosis ( 25 m g / mL nystatin and 10 m g / mL progesterone , 200 m M genistein , 500 m M N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) , or 18 (cid:3) C temperature hold ( A ) . ( B ) Inhibition of clathrin - dependent endocytosis by removal of potassium from the assay buffer or treatment with 100 m M chlorpromazine ( CPZ ) did not affect AEA uptake . Figure taken from McFarland et al . ( 2004 ) . 42 Marla L . Yates and Eric L . Barker we showed that caveolae also appear to mediate AEA uptake in neuronal cells , as well ( McFarland et al . , 2008 ) . Small inhibitory RNA ( siRNA ) - mediated knockdown of dynamin 2 ( Dyn2 ) , a protein involved in both the distinct caveolae - related and clathrin - dependent endocytosis events , inhib - ited the uptake of the fluorescent AEA analog SKM 4 - 45 - 1 in mouse neuronal CAD cells ( McFarland et al . , 2008 ) . However , treatment of these cells with siRNA targeting the b 2 adaptin subunit of the clathrin - associated activator protein 2 complex ( AP2 ) , which is involved only in clathrin - dependent endocytosis , had no effect ( McFarland et al . , 2008 ) . The decrease in Dyn2 expression had no observable effect on either FAAH expression or activity suggesting that the disruption of caveolae - related endocytosis alone led to the decrease in AEA uptake ( McFarland et al . , 2008 ) . The caveolae - mediated endocytic uptake of AEA has been further sup - ported by other published reports ( Bari et al . , 2005a , b , 2006 ; Rimmerman et al . , 2007 ) . Recently , Rimmerman et al . ( 2007 ) showed that exogenously applied AEA localizes to lipid rafts . In 2005 , Bari and colleagues ( 2005a , b ) reported that following lipid raft / CRM domain disruption with the cholesterol - depleting agent methyl - b cyclodextrin , CB 1 receptor signaling increased by twofold in C6 glioma cells . These results indicate that inhibition of AEA uptake via the disruption of lipid rafts / CRM domains led to an increased availability of extracellular AEA for CB 1 receptor activation ( Bari et al . , 2005a , b ) . Additionally , other endocannabinoids may utilize CRM domains to enter the cell as disruption of lipid raft / CRM domain formation was also shown to decrease uptake of the endocannabinoid 2 - AG ( Bari et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly , these specialized plasma membrane microdomains have been previously implicated in the endocytic uptake of the long - chain fatty acid oleate ( Pohl et al . , 2002 ; Ring et al . , 2002 ) and the fatty acid - and AEA - binding protein albumin ( Vogel et al . , 2001 ) . In vascular endothelial cells , the caveolae - mediated transcytosis of albumin is apparently triggered by the binding of albumin to its receptor , gp60 ( Vogel et al . , 2001 ) . As AEA has an affinity for albumin ( Bojesen and Hansen , 2003 ) and has been shown to be transported in HUVECs ( Maccarrone et al . , 2000 ) , one could question whether AEA uptake into these cells is also dependent upon a caveolae - related endocytic process , as appears to be the case in other cell lines ( McFarland et al . , 2004 ) . Furthermore , one could also ask whether the caveolae - related endocytosis of AEA is dependent upon albumin binding its apparent caveolae - localized receptor . To our knowledge , there are no reports outlining such studies . In addition to providing evidence of a role for caveolae in AEA uptake , our data support the existence of a plasma membrane - localized AEA bind - ing protein ( McFarland et al . , 2008 ) . Knockdown of Dyn2 in CAD cells only affected the uptake of the fluorescent AEA analog SKM 4 - 45 - 1 and did not alter the apparent accumulation of radiolabeled AEA ( McFarland et al . , 2008 ) . SKM 4 - 45 - 1 , which is transported via the same mechanism as AEA , Organized Transport of AEA and Related Lipids 43 only fluoresces once inside the cell where the fluorescein moiety can be cleaved from anandamide by intracellular esterases ( Muthian et al . , 2000 ) . Therefore , we interpreted these results to suggest that using the radioactive uptake assay , one cannot discern between the association of AEA with the plasma membrane , possibly via a binding protein , and the actual internali - zation of AEA into the cell ( McFarland et al . , 2008 ) . Recently Moore and colleagues ( 2005 ) reported the development of the cell - impermeable high - affinity AEA uptake inhibitor LY2318912 . Although the parent compound , LY2183240 , has since been found to inhibit FAAH activity ( Alexander and Cravatt , 2006 ) , Moore et al . ( 2005 ) report that LY2318912 binds in a pharmacologically similar manner to cells both expressing and devoid of FAAH . These data suggest that this com - pound interacts with a target that is distinct from FAAH ( Moore et al . , 2005 ) . Perhaps the putative binding protein inferred from our data and discussed above is , in fact , the target of this unique AEA uptake inhibitor . As has been reviewed above , there is still much debate concerning the mechanism ( s ) by which AEA is accumulated in cells . However , the major - ity of data support a model for a protein - facilitated process ( Di Marzo et al . , 1994 ; Fegley et al . , 2004 ; Hillard et al . , 1997 ; Ligresti et al . , 2004 ; Maccarrone et al . , 2000 ; McFarland et al . , 2004 , 2008 ; Ortega - Gutierrez et al . , 2004 ; Rakhshan et al . , 2000 ) . New developments , including the synthesis of biotin - tagged AEA ( Fezza et al . , 2008 ) and several photoaffinity ligands for the putative AEA carrier protein ( Balas et al . , 2005 ; Moore et al . , 2005 ; Moriello et al . , 2006 ) , keep the debate surrounding AEA uptake alive and indicate that we may soon have a better understanding of this controversial process . E . Implications of pharmacologically altered AEA signaling There are an overwhelming number of implications for AEA and other endocannabinoids in various physiologically and pathophysiologically rele - vant human states including pain ( Hohmann and Suplita , 2006 ) , appetite ( Kirkham and Tucci , 2006 ) , reproduction ( Wang et al . , 2006 ) , mood and anxiety ( Witkin et al . , 2005 ) , the cardiovascular system ( Ashton and Smith , 2007 ) , alcoholism ( Rodriguez de Fonseca et al . , 2005 ) , spasticity ( Pertwee , 2002 ) , neurodegeneration ( Battista et al . , 2006 ) , and inflamma - tion ( Ashton , 2007 ) . In fact , these cited references are merely examples of the numerous reviews recently written on each representative topic . One way to alter AEA signaling , to achieve desirable health benefits , is to modulate its uptake into cells . As was noted by Moore et al . ( 2005 ) modulating AEA signaling in this way would be superior to modulation of AEA receptor signaling directly because inhibition of AEA uptake would allow for increased signaling only in areas where AEA was already present and physiologically active . Hence , the putative AEA - transport protein 44 Marla L . Yates and Eric L . Barker should prove to be a significant pharmacological target . To truly understand and pharmacologically exploit AEA signaling , we must continue to focus our efforts on better understanding the mechanism ( s ) governing AEA uptake in various cell types , as well as continuing the search for the putative and elusive AEA carrier protein ( s ) .
