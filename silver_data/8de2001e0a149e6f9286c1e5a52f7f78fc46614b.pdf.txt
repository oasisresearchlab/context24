Local self - amplifyingprocesses could enhance and stabilize the initial asymmetry in the distribution of axon / dendrite determinants , but the identity of these processes remains elusive . We here report that BDNF , a secreted neurotrophin essential for the survivaland differentiation ofmanyneuronal populations , servesas a self - amplifying autocrine factor in promoting axon formation in embryonic hippocampal neurons by triggering two nested positive - feedback mechanisms . First , BDNF elevates cytoplasmic cAMP and protein kinase A activity , which triggers further secretion of BDNF and membrane insertion of its receptor TrkB . Second , BDNF / TrkB signaling activates PI3 - kinase that promotes anterograde transport of TrkB in the putative axon , further enhancing local BDNF / TrkB signaling . Together , these self - amplifying BDNF actions ensure stable elevation of local cAMP / protein kinase A activity that is critical for axon differentiation and growth . axon initiation and growth | cAMP / protein kinase A elevation | neurotrophin autocrine loops | Trk redistribution T he most distinct cellular feature of the neuron is its polarized structure , consisting of a single long axon and many short and highly branched dendrites . This polarized structure is essential for two primary neuronal functions : the reception and integration of synaptic inputs at the dendrite , and the conduction and delivery of output signals to other cells via the axon . For the formation of this polarity , the postmitotic neuron may have inherited an asymmetry in the activity or distribution of speci ﬁ c cellular components that could trigger local axon / dendrite differentiation . Alternatively , extracellular environment may provide an asymmetric signal in the neuron that speci ﬁ es its polarity . Such a polarization process may also occur spontaneously , as shown by isolated embryonic hippo - campal neurons cultured on a uniform substrate ( 1 ) . These neu - rons undergo polarization through distinct stages — the formation of dynamic lamellipodia around the cell periphery ( stage 1 ) within a few hours after plating , the appearance of several neurites of similar morphology ( stage 2 ) after 12 – 16 h in culture , and differen - tiation of one axon and multiple dendrites ( stage 3 ) within 1 – 1 . 5 d . Recent studies have shown that local elevation of cAMP and protein kinase A ( PKA ) activity , acting through downstream ac - tivation of LKB1 and SAD kinases ( 2 – 4 ) , is a critical early event in axon initiation . In cultured developing hippocampal neuron , we also showed that extracellular applied BDNF promotes axon dif - ferentiation by elevating cAMP in the undifferentiated neurites ( 5 ) . In the present study , we further showed that endogenous BDNF in developing hippocampal neurons promotes axon initi - ation and growth by locally elevating and stabilizing cAMP / PKA activity through self - amplifying autocrine actions . As a member of the neurotrophin family , BDNF was initially identi ﬁ ed as a target - derived factor that promotes the survival of several populations of central neurons ( 6 – 9 ) . However , mRNAs of BDNF and its TrkB receptor coexist in the same neuron ( 10 , 11 ) , and antisense BDNF oligonucleotides ( 12 , 13 ) and anti - BDNF antiserum ( 14 , 15 ) could reduce the survival of cultured neurons , even as isolated single cells ( 13 ) . Thus , BDNF may act as an autocrine factor for maintaining neuronal survival during target - independent stages of development ( 16 ) . However , for rapid modulatory actions of BDNF on nerve growth ( 17 , 18 ) and syn - aptic function ( 19 ) , it remains unclear whether BDNF acts as an autocrine , paracrine , or target - derived factor , and whether the neuronal action of secreted BDNF is local or global . Previous studies have shown that local application of BDNF to the neurite of cultured hippocampal neurons triggers its differentiation into the axon ( 4 ) . Here , we show that axon development also depends on the secretion of endogenous BDNF , which acts as an autocrine rather than paracrine factor . Using BDNF conjugated to a pH - sensitive probe to monitor BDNF secretion , we found that extra - cellular BDNF can trigger BDNF secretion from the neurite by local elevation of cAMP / PKA activity . In addition , BDNF also promotes surface insertion of its receptor TrkB through cAMP / PKA activation and anterograde TrkB transport via PI3 - kinase ( PI3K ) activation , further amplifying the BDNF / TrkB signaling . These autocrine actions of BDNF are ampli ﬁ ed by nested positive - feedback loops , resulting in stable elevation of local cAMP / PKA activity required for axon development ( 4 ) . Results Secreted BDNF Acts as an Autocrine Factor for Axon Development . We ﬁ rst tested the hypothesis that the developing neuron secretes BDNF to promote its own axon development . The action of se - creted BDNF on cultured rat hippocampal neurons was disrupted by the addition of BDNF antibodies or TrkB - Fc , a soluble ligand for scavenging secreted BDNF , at 6 h after cell plating . Immu - nostaining of these neurons 2 d later showed that the percentage of neurons exhibiting axon formation was signi ﬁ cantly lower than those found in untreated cultures or in cultures treated with IgG - Fc or antibodies against NGF ( Fig . 1 A and B ) . Similar effects on axon differentiation were found when a membrane - permeable trk tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a or the PKA inhibitor KT5720 was added to the culture , whereas no effect was observed after adding K252b , an analog of K252a with poor membrane permeability . These results based on BDNF antibodies , TrkB - Fc , and K252a together support the notion that BDNF secreted from these neurons facilitates spontaneous axon differentiation via TrkB - and cAMP / PKA - dependent processes . We then tested whether BDNF acts as an autocrine or paracrine factor in promoting axon differentiation . The BDNF expression was down - regulated in a small population of neurons in these cultures by transfection with two speci ﬁ c siRNAs against BDNF translation [ BDNF - siRNA # 1 and # 2 ( 20 ) ; SI Materials and Methods ] , together with EGFP as a marker . We found a marked reduction of axon formation in BDNF - siRNA – expressing neurons but not in untransfected neurons in the same culture nor in neu - rons transfected with a scrambled form of siRNA ( Fig . 1 A and B ) . Furthermore , we found that BDNF also acts as an autocrine factor to promote axon growth in polarized neurons . This was shown by the ﬁ nding that 12 - h treatment with TrkB - Fc , K252a , KT5720 , or Author contributions : P . - L . C . , X . Z . , and M . - M . P . designed research ; P . - L .

Consistent with previous ﬁ ndings ( 17 , 21 ) , addition of puri ﬁ ed recombinant BDNF ( 50 ng / mL ) markedly increased axon growth ( Fig . 1 C and D ) . In contrast , axon / dendrite growth was not affected by the treatment with IgG - Fc , K252b , or a scrambled form of siRNA ( Fig . 1 C and D ) . cAMP Mediates BDNF - Induced BDNF Secretion . To monitor directly the process of BDNF secretion in developing neurons , we trans - fected cultured hippocampal neurons at 6 h after plating with a construct coding for BDNF conjugated with a pH - sensitive form of EGFP [ BDNF - pHluorin ( 22 ) ; SI Materials and Methods ] and monitored the secretion of BDNF - pHluorin by its ﬂ uorescence increase upon exocytic secretion to the extracellular space ( 23 ) . Bath addition of forskolin ( 20 μ M ) , which elevates cAMP by ac - tivating adenylate cyclase , or membrane - permeant cAMP analog Sp - cAMPS ( 50 μ M ) resulted in an increase in the BDNF - pHluorin ﬂ uorescence surrounding most neurites of unpolarized neurons ( stage 2 ) ( 1 ) in 14 – 24 h cultures ( Fig . 2 A1 and B1 ) , consistent with a previous study using ELISA in pituitary adenoma cell line ( 24 ) . In contrast , the same treatment of polarized neurons ( stage 3 ) ( 1 ) in 2 - d cultures increased BDNF - pHluorin ﬂ uorescence along the axon but not dendrites , with the highest accumulation in the distal axon ( Fig . 2 A2 and B2 ) . This increased ﬂ uorescence was due to secreted BDNF - pHluorin adhering to the cell surface or culture substrate , because it was completely eliminated by bath - applied membrane - impermeant ﬂ uorescence quencher bromophenol blue ( Fig . S1 ) ( 25 ) . Furthermore , forskolin - induced ﬂ uorescence in - crease was absent when KT5270 was present in the medium , in - dicating that this secretion was mediated by PKA . Thus , axon / dendrite differentiation is accompanied by a redistribution of cAMP / PKA - sensitive BDNF secretion toward the axon . Previous ELISA measurements have shown that neurotrophins can induce neurotrophin release via the regulated secretory pathway ( 26 , 27 ) . In this study we also performed ELISA on the supernatant of hippocampal cell cultures and found that BDNF secretion was signi ﬁ cantly elevated by bath addition of forskolin , Sp - cAMPS , or high K + , and this elevation was abolished by coaddition of KT5720 ( Fig . S2 ) . Furthermore , we examined the topography of BDNF - induced BDNF secretion in single de - veloping hippocampal neurons that expressed BDNF - pHluorin . Similar to that observed for Sp - cAMPS and forskolin , bath - applied BDNF ( 50 ng / mL ) increased BDNF - pHluorin ﬂ uorescence asso - ciated with all neurites in stage - 2 neurons ( Fig . 2 C1 and D1 ) , but with only the axon in stage - 3 neurons ( Fig . 2 C2 and D2 ) . No ﬂ uorescence increase was observed in the presence of KT5720 in both cases . The above study showed that BDNF - pHluorin ﬂ uo - rescence changes induced by forskolin and BDNF showed similar topography and PKA dependence , suggesting that BDNF may trigger BDNF secretion by increasing the cAMP level . This was tested by directly measuring the level of cAMP and PKA activity with ﬂ uorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) sensors indicator of cAMP using Epac ( ICUE ) and A - kinase activity reporter ( AKAR ) ( SI Materials and Methods ) , respectively . We found that bath - applied BDNF induced an elevation of cAMP and PKA activity in neurons expressing ICUE and AKAR ( Fig . 3 A and Fig . S3 ) , respectively , with a time course and magnitude similar to that induced by forskolin ( 28 ) . Furthermore , BDNF - induced cAMP / PKA elevation was present in all neurites of stage - 2 neu - rons but became localized to the axon in stage - 3 neuron ( Fig . 3 A2 ) , indicating a redistribution of BDNF - sensitive mechanism during neuronal polarization , similar to that found for forskolin - and BDNF - induced BDNF secretion . Thus , BDNF could trigger BDNF secretion by elevating cAMP / PKA activity . BDNF - Induced Local cAMP Elevation Triggers Axon Differentiation . To determine whether BDNF - induced BDNF secretion operates at a local or global level in the neuron , we applied BDNF to cul - tured hippocampal neurons with latex beads covalently coated with BDNF ( SI Materials and Methods ) . The beads were removed within a few minutes after the contact to avoid long - term nonspeci ﬁ c effects of the bead , as shown by the induction of ACh receptor clusters by positively charged beads in the muscle ﬁ ber ( 29 ) . We found that the cAMP level , as indicated by FRET signals from ICUE - transfected neurons , was elevated locally and persistently near the contact site within a few minutes after the bead contact with the neurite of stage - 2 neurons ( Fig . 3 A1 and A2 ) . Consistent with a previous report ( 28 ) , the cAMP level in noncontacted neurites of the same cell was reduced ( Fig . 3 A2 ) , indicating long - range inhibitory signaling . Furthermore , the BDNF - coated bead also induced a local elevation of pHluorin ﬂ uorescence at the site of bead contact in neurons expressing BDNF - pHluorin , with a time course consistent with cAMP / PKA - dependent BDNF secretion ( Fig . S4 ) . The cAMP / PKA elevation induced by either bath - or bead - applied BDNF was reduced by the presence of K252a but not A B C D Fig . 1 .

With the caveat that K252a may exert nonspeci ﬁ c effect , these results do suggest the involvement of Trk signaling ( Fig . 3 A3 ) . Consistent with the developmental transition in the topog - raphy of BDNF secretion ( Fig . 2 ) , BDNF - induced cAMP elevation was observed at the axon , not at dendrites ( Fig . 3 A2 ) . Thus , there were similar developmental changes in the topography of cAMP elevation and BDNF secretion . The localized cAMP elevation and BDNF secretion triggered by BDNF - coated beads suggests that BDNF - triggered secretion of BDNF could serve as a self - amplifying mechanism for maintaining a stable and localized cAMP elevation , which is required for axon speci ﬁ cation via PKA - dependent phosphorylation of LKB1 ( 4 ) and subsequent activation of a cascade of downstream effector enzymes [ e . g . , SAD kinases ( 2 , 3 ) ] . Furthermore , BDNF - coated bead could promote axon differentiation of stage - 2 neuron of the contacted neurite . When beads were manipulated into contact with the undifferentiated neurites of stage - 2 neurons , and the same neurons were re - examined 2 d later for axon formation ( Fig . 3 B1 ) , we found a signi ﬁ cantly higher incidence of axon formation for neurites contacted by forskolin - or BDNF - coated beads than for those coated with BSA ( Fig . 3 B2 ) . In contrast , we found no signi ﬁ cant effect on the FRET signal and axon initiation after the 3 - to 5 - min contact of the neurite with uncoated or BSA - coated beads . Thus , local exposure to BDNF or elevation of cAMP in - deed promotes local axon differentiation in these neurons . PKA - Dependent Surface Insertion of TrkB Receptor . Measurements of BDNF - pHluorin secretion showed a transition from uniform secretion over all neurites to a restricted secretion at the axon as the neuron becomes polarized . Immunostaining of surface TrkB with ectodomain - speci ﬁ c antibodies showed a similar redistri - bution of TrkB toward the axon ( Fig . 4 A1 ) . The speci ﬁ city of the TrkB antibodies used was con ﬁ rmed by Western blot assays in HEK293 cells , showing higher immunostaining for lysates from cells transfected with TrkB - expressing construct than from non - transfected control cells . To have a control for the membrane area of the neuron , we used the staining with rhodamine - conjugated Con A ( R - ConA ) , a plant lectin that binds to glucose and mannose residues of all cell surface glycoproteins . After normalization of the TrkB staining with that of R - ConA , we found that the highest TrkB staining intensity at the neurite tip of stage - 2 neurons was 121 % ± 14 % ( SEM , n = 13 ) of the mean intensity of tips of the same neuron ( as shown for neurites with ﬁ ve highest intensities ; Fig . 4 B1 ) . For stage - 3 neurons , however , the TrkB staining in - tensity at the axonal tip was 479 % ± 50 % ( SEM , n = 19 ) of the mean tip intensity ( Fig . 4 B2 ) . This topographic redistribution of TrkB could be due to either an increased rate of TrkB membrane insertion at the axon or increased traf ﬁ cking of TrkB precursor vesicles toward the axon , or both . It could also account for the restricted BDNF - induced secretion of BDNF - pHluorin at the distal axon of polarized neurons . Further studies showed that membrane insertion of TrkB could be regulated by BDNF and cytoplasmic cAMP . We found that treatment with either forskolin ( 20 μ M ) or BDNF ( 50 ng / mL ) for 3 h at 10 h after cell plating in the presence of the translational inhibitor cycloheximide ( 25 μ g / mL ) resulted in an elevated level of surface TrkB in stage - 2 neurons ( Fig . S5 A ) . The forskolin effect was abolished by the presence of KT5720 , whereas the BDNF effect was abolished by the presence of KT5720 , K252a ( but not K252b ) , or the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 ( Fig . S5 B ) . Similar ﬁ ndings were obtained in the absence of cycloheximide ( Fig . S6 A ) .

S6 B ) . These results are consistent with those found in retinal ganglion cells ( 30 ) and indicate that surface TrkB expression promoted by BDNF depends on cAMP / PKA and PI3 activities but not on protein synthesis . Furthermore , treatment with KT5720 , K252a ( but not K252b ) , or LY294002 alone lowered the surface TrkB expression ( Fig . S5 B ) , suggesting that constitu - tive surface TrkB expression is under the regulation of basal PKA and PI3K activities . Whether BDNF / cAMP signaling may act locally to regulate TrkB surface expression was further examined by plating stage - 2 neurons on substrates coated with stripes of membrane - permeable ﬂ uorescent cAMP analog ( F - cAMP ) or BDNF ( SI Materials and Methods ) . For all cells with their soma located at the stripe boundary , we compared the average immunostaining ﬂ uorescence of the surface TrkB at neurite tips “ on ” and “ off ” the stripe ( normalized by that of R - ConA staining ) and found a signi ﬁ cant preference for the surface TrkB to be expressed on neurites in contact with either F - cAMP or BDNF stripes ( Fig . S5 C ) . This preference was abolished by KT5720 and K252a , but not K252b ( Fig . S5 D ) . This is consistent with cAMP / PKA - dependent in - sertion of TrkB induced by F - cAMP or BDNF . By expressing a fusion construct of TrkB - GFP in these neurons , we further found that TrkB surface expression was locally increased within minutes after the contact with a BDNF - coated bead ( Fig . S5 E ) . This local TrkB increase was absent when the bead contact was made in the presence of LY294002 , TrkB - IgG , and K252a but was unaffected by IgG - Fc , KT5720 , or K252b , indicating that BDNF - induced accumulation of TrkB - GFP depends on TrkB and PI3K activity but not PKA activity . This ﬁ nding suggests that BDNF / TrkB sig - naling at the neuritic growth cone promotes anterograde transport of TrkB in a PI3K - dependent manner . PI3K - Dependent Anterograde TrkB Transport . Previous studies have shown that the retrograde transport of TrkA in sympathetic neu - rons depends on PI3K / Akt activity ( 31 , 32 ) . In this study , we found that in stage - 3 neurons overexpressing TrkB - GFP , bath - application of BDNF or forskolin for 4 h induced a marked preferential in - crease of TrkB - GFP in the axon ( Fig . S7 A ) , a process abolished by the presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 , indicating a BDNF / cAMP - dependent anterograde transport of TrkB in the nascent axon . Direct measurements of TrkB transport were made by using the method of ﬂ uorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) . The neurons were transfected with TrkB - GFP at 16 h after plating and examined 1 d later at stage 3 . The GFP ﬂ uorescence was photobleached at the axon shaft for a segment of ≈ 50 μ m , and ﬂ uorescence recovery at the most proximal and most distal 10 - μ m regions of the bleached segment was monitored ( Fig . S7 B1 ) . We found that in the nascent axon , the recovery rate at the proximal end was in general higher than that at the distal end ( Fig . S7 B1 ) , suggesting net anterograde transport of TrkB . In control neurons expressing TrkB - GFP , the half - time of ﬂ uorescence recovery ( t 1 / 2 ) at the proximal end was 57 ± 13 s ( SEM , n = 6 ) . Addition of BDNF reduced t 1 / 2 to 18 ± 9 s ( SEM , n = 6 ; Fig . S7 B2 ) , indicating accelerated anterograde TrkB transport , and this effect of BDNF remained in the presence of KT5720 ( t 1 / 2 = 21 ± 8 s , SEM , n = 6 ) . In contrast , inhibiting PI3K with LY294002 completely prevented the BDNF effect and further prolonged the recovery ( t 1 / 2 = 77 ± 15 s , SEM , n = 6 ; Fig . S7 B2 ) . Thus , BDNF / TrkB signaling triggers both PKA - dependent membrane insertion of TrkB as well as PI3K - dependent anterograde transport of TrkB . Discussion In this work , we found a rapid autocrine action of BDNF in axon development and delineated several positive - feedback mecha - nisms by which BDNF could elevate and stabilize local neuritic cAMP / PKA activity , which is known to promote axon differenti - ation and growth . As depicted in Fig . 5 , the initial trigger for axon differentiation may come from a gradient of extracellular polar - izing factors , an intrinsic cytoplasmic asymmetry in the postmitotic neuron , or stochastic ﬂ uctuation of cytoplasmic signals , all of which may cause a local cAMP elevation in one of the neurites of stage - 2 neurons . Local cAMP / PKA activity could induce local BDNF secretion and TrkB insertion into the plasma membrane that further enhance the autocrine action of BDNF . In addition , BDNF / TrkB signaling also elevates the PI3K activity that pro - motes anterograde TrkB transport , which further enhances sur - Fig . 3 .

These nested positive - feedback mechanisms enable the establishment of a stable cAMP / PKA activity locally in the neurite , resulting in its differ - entiation into axon , with accompanying accumulation of TrkB and BDNF secretion activity toward the nascent axon . This self - am - plifying autocrine action of BDNF remains in operation after axon speci ﬁ cation , promoting the accelerated growth of the axon . No - tably , these autocrine effects of BDNF are rapid posttranslational events independent of protein synthesis and are thus distinct from those that promote neuronal survival ( 15 , 16 , 33 ) . Over a longer time scale , feedback mechanisms involving transcriptional and translational regulators could also modulate the level of BDNF and TrkB expression in the neuron ( 34 – 36 ) . Whether and to what extent the latter participates in axon formation remain to be determined . As ﬁ rst pointed out by Ramon y Cajal more than a century ago ( 37 ) , developing neuritic processes resemble migrating cells , which can sense gradients of extracellular cues and become polarized as they undergo chemotactic migration . Such gradient sensing and cell polarization could be enhanced by local excitation via positive - feedback loops and global inhibition via long - range diffusible in - hibitor ( 38 ) . These two processes could also stabilize cytoplasmic asymmetry originated from stochastic ﬂ uctuation of polarity determinants , leading to spontaneous polarization of migrating cells in the absence of chemoattractants ( 39 ) . Positive - feedback loops mediated by PIP3 and Rho GTPase has been demonstrated in neutrophil polarization during chemotaxis ( 40 , 41 ) . In cultured hippocampal neurons , PI3K activity was highly localized to the tip of the newly speci ﬁ ed axon , and inhibitors of PI3K disrupted such localization and prevented neuronal polarization ( 42 ) . Because PI3K is a major downstream effector of BDNF ( 8 ) , the highly localized PI3K at the axonal tip could initially be triggered by the localized autocrine action of BDNF , and the PI3K / PIP3 / RhoGTPase feedback loop thus represents another positive - feedback loop in promoting PI3K - dependent TrkB anterograde transport shown in the present study ( Fig . S7 ) . Indeed , asymmetric PIP3 and Akt signaling was found to mediate chemotaxis of neu - ritic growth cones of Xenopus spinal neurons induced by a gradi - ent of BDNF ( 43 ) . Other activators of PI3K [ e . g . , shootin1 and Singar1 / 2 ( 44 , 45 ) ] resulting from asymmetric intrinsic or extrinsic factors could also serve as the initial trigger for the activation of PI3K . In the latter scenario , local elevation of PI3K could then induce local accumulation of TrkB in the neurite , leading to ele - vated BDNF / TrkB signaling and subsequent ampli ﬁ cation via both PI3K and cAMP / PKA pathways . The autocrine BDNF action links these two major signaling pathways via nested positive - feedback loops and ensures their activation for axon differentiation and growth . The initial trigger could occur as an induced or sponta - neous activation of one component in these nested positive - feed - back loops , and blocking the critical catalytic component in each loop ( TrkB , PKA , or PI3K ) could reduce ( but not completely abolish ) axon formation . We have observed a striking reorganization of BDNF / TrkB sig - naling toward the axon during the process of axon formation . This was shown by the transition of global BDNF secretion in stage - 2 neurons to localized BDNF secretion at the axon in stage - 3 neurons ( Fig . 2 ) , together with similar redistribution of surface TrkB ( Fig . 4 A1 ) . These are accompanied by spatially correlated changes in the constitutive cAMP / PKA activity toward the distal axon ( Fig . 4 A2 ) . Using FRET imaging of the PKA activity in AKAR - expressing hippocampal neurons , we found that in stage - 2 neurons the varia - tion of FRET signals at the neurite tips was small , and the neurite lengths were similar ( Fig . 4 B1 ) . In contrast , in stage - 3 polarized neurons , the PKA signals at the axon tip were much higher than those at dendritic tips , with the axon tip signal 330 % ± 7 % ( n = 10 ) of the mean value at dendrite tips ( Fig . 4 B2 ) . This indicates that neuronal polarization undergoes a transition from relatively uniform cAMP / PKA activities in undifferentiated neurites to a much higher cAMP / PKA activity at the distal axon , in line with the topographic transition of BDNF - induced BDNF secretion and TrkB surface 0 1 2 Axon ( n = 15 ) Dendrite ( n = 35 ) N1 N3 N2 N4 ( n = 10each ) F R E T ( no r m . ) 40 0 . 5 0 1 0 20 1 2 3 4 5 T r k B / R - C on A L e ng t h ( µ m ) 0 . 5 1 0 PKA Surf TrkB Stage2 Stage3 CFP YFP FRET AKAR ( P KA ) Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 2 Stage 3 T r k B R - C on A 0 . 2 1 . 70 . 0 1 . 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 80 120 160 200 ( µ m ) 0 2 4 0 40 80 120 Ax D1 D2 D3 D4 0 1 2 PKA Surf TrkB * * * * * F R E T ( n o r m . ) 0 0 0 1 2 3 A1 A2 B1 B2 Fig . 4 .

Nested positive - feedback mechanisms in autocrine BDNF / TrkB sig - naling . First , local elevation of cAMP / PKA activity resulting from intrinsic or extrinsic signals causes local secretion , which in turn further elevates local cAMP / PKA activity . Second , local cAMP / PKA activity causes local surface in - sertion of TrkB , further amplifying BDNF / TrkB signaling and enhancing local cAMP / PKA activity . Third , elevating BDNF / TrkB signaling activates PI3K ac - tivity , which promotes anterograde traf ﬁ cking of TrkB , further enhancing local surface insertion of TrkB and BDNF / TrkB signaling . 18434 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1115907108 Cheng et al . expression during axon formation . The localization of these cellular activities could be the consequence of the self - amplifying autocrine signaling of BDNF and directly associated with the process of axon speci ﬁ cation and the accelerated growth of nascent axons . A critical property of BDNF as an autocrine factor is that it is highly positively charged ( pI ≈ 9 ) . This allows immediate binding of secreted BDNF to the cell surface ( 26 ) or extracellular matrix near the secretion site . Localized action of secreted BDNF at the synapse plays a critical role in synapse - speci ﬁ c long - term modi - ﬁ cation ( 46 ) . In developing neuron , localized secretion allows local ampli ﬁ cation of autocrine signals , a critical step in breaking the cellular symmetry during axon / dendrite formation . Besides BDNF , other neurotrophin family members ( e . g . , NT3 ) may also serve similar self - amplifying autocrine functions in axon de - velopment . Mice lacking the gene that encodes CAPS2 ( Ca 2 + - dependent activator proteins for secretion 2 ) , a protein partici - pating in dense - core vesicle exocytosis and BDNF / NT - 3 release from parallel ﬁ bers of cerebellar granule cells , have shown de - velopmental de ﬁ cits , including fewer branched dendrites in Pur - kinje cells and loss of the intercrural ﬁ ssure ( 47 ) . This supports the notion that impairment of neurotrophin secretion causes differentiation defects in neurons . However , paracrine action of neurotrophin may also contribute in part to axon / dendrite de - velopment . The variability and limitation of the present experi - ments make it rather dif ﬁ cult to clearly differentiate between the autocrine and paracrine effects . In addition , no abnormality in axon development has been reported in mice with bdnf gene deletion ( 48 ) ; this could be attributed to compensatory effects of other factors or other neurotrophin family members of similar autocrine function . Further studies using primary neuron cultures from these knockout animals would help to determine whether such compensatory mechanisms exist in these neurons . Re - dundant actions of multiple factors may help to ensure the presence of local positive - feedback mechanisms for symmetry breaking during neuronal polarization .
