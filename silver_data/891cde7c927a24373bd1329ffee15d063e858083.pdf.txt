All rights reserved . DOI 10 . 1016 / j . ceb . 2008 . 06 . 001 Introduction The extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , which plays crucial roles in development , tissue homeostasis and disease , is a heterogeneous meshwork of ﬁbrillar and non - ﬁbrillar components . ECM can be assembled into elaborate struc - tures such as basement membranes , provide a scaffold for cell adhesion and migration , and regulate numerous cell functions by activating multiple signalling pathways at adhesion sites . A major fraction of the ECM is composed of collagens , laminins and other glycoproteins such as ﬁbronectin ( FN ) , which serve as substrates for different adhesion molecules including the heterodimeric cell sur - face receptors , integrins [ 1 ] . Importantly , these ECM components are secreted by cells as non - functional build - ing units , which are assembled into functional supramo - lecular structures in a highly regulated manner [ 2 – 4 ] . The functional properties of the FN ﬁbrillar matrix are diverse and represent a prime example of how ECM protein assembly functions . First , FN ﬁbrils possess bind - ing sites for multiple ECM components ( Figure 1 ) , which are used to orchestrate the assembly of several other ECM proteins , including collagen I and III , ﬁbulin - 1 , ﬁbrinogen , thrombospondin - 1 ( for a review see [ 5 ] ) , latent Transforming Growth Factor - b ( TGF - b ) binding protein - 1 ( LTBP - 1 ) [ 6 (cid:2) ] , decorin and biglycan ( Chen et al . , in press ) . Second , FN ﬁbrils provide structural support for cell adhesion at the same time as the adhesion receptors , most notably integrins , transduce signals that promote actin dynamics , cell migration , cell proliferation and apoptosis [ 2 , 3 ] . Finally , FN controls the availability of growth factors , for example by regulating their acti - vation from latent complexes as shown for TGF - b [ 7 (cid:2) ] . Therefore , it is not surprising that a constitutive FN gene ablation in mice has dramatic consequences in vivo that are characterized by severe mesodermal , vascular and neural tube defects leading to lethality at around embryo - nic day ( E ) 8 . 5 ( E8 . 5 ) [ 8 ] . FN is a modular protein , which consists of an array of type I , II and III domains and is characterized by several FN - speciﬁc features . FN is secreted as a disulﬁde - bonded dimer , and the dimerization seems to be required to assemble FN into a ﬁbrillar matrix ( see Figure 1 ; [ 9 ] ) . Furthermore , the FN gene can be alternatively spliced allowing the expression of up to 20 possible monomeric isoforms in man and up to 12 in mouse , which may result in an even larger variety of FN dimers [ 10 ] . Finally , FN exists in two forms ; cellular FN ( cFN ) , which is present in tissues where it is assembled into a ﬁbrillar matrix , and plasma FN ( pFN ) , which is produced by hepatocytes and is secreted into the blood where it remains in a non - ﬁbrillar , soluble form . Interestingly , in a recent report pFN was shown to diffuse into tissues where it is incorp - orated into the ﬁbrillar matrix [ 11 ] . The existence of ﬁbrillar cFN and soluble pFN largely results from the fact that the assembly of the FN ﬁbrils is a cell - driven process , in which integrins play a central role [ 12 ] . Integ - rins shift between a low afﬁnity ( also called inactive ) and a high afﬁnity ( active ) conformation [ 13 ] . In tissues , cells express activated integrins that immediately bind cFN that is secreted as a compact globular structure harbouring hidden , cryptic sites for binding other FN molecules . Binding is followed by generation of mechanical tension via the actin cytoskeleton , which leads to stretching of the bound FN molecule , unravelling of the cryptic ‘self - association’ sites and ﬁnally the binding to other FN molecules , resulting in a chain - reaction of self - assembly and ﬁbril formation [ 14 , 15 ] . In blood , however , haema - Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2008 , 20 : 502 – 507 www . sciencedirect . com topoietic cells express their integrins in an inactive con - formation , which prevents cells from binding pFN and assembling FN ﬁbrils . As soon as the blood cell integrins shift into the high afﬁnity conformation , for example when platelets are activated in response to a vascular injury , pFN is bound and assembled into ﬁbrils , which in the case of platelets are required for thrombus growth and stability [ 16 , 17 ] . To date , 11 different integrin heterodimers are reported to be capable of binding to FN ( see Figure 1 ) , and four of them , a 5 b 1 , a v b 3 , a 4 b 1 and a IIb b 3 trigger FN ﬁbril formation in vitro [ 18 , 19 ] . In addition , recent studies have implicated non - integrin cell surface receptors in FN binding and ﬁbrillogenesis [ 20 , 21 ] . In this review we will summarize the current knowledge about the function of FN – integrin interactions in the process of FN ﬁbril assembly and place it in the context of recent in vivo observations . RGD motif and synergy site : the central cell binding motifs of FN More than two decades ago , Ruoslahti and colleagues demonstrated that cell adhesion to FN depends on the RGD motif located in the 10th type III domain ( see Figure 1 ) [ 22 ] and that the RGD motif is bound by a 5 b 1 integrin [ 23 ] . Since then , several additional integ - rins were shown to bind to the RGD motif of FN , including all members of the a v subfamily , a 8 b 1 , a 9 b 1 and the platelet - speciﬁc a IIb b 3 integrin ( see Figure 1 ; [ 24 ] ; for a review , see [ 25 ] ) . Among the FN binding integrins , a 5 b 1 is considered of major importance for the formation of an elaborate meshwork of FN ﬁbrils . The a 5 b 1 integrins bind FN , then pull out from focal adhesions and translocate along actin stress ﬁbres towards the cell centre where they form a new adhesion structure called ﬁbrillar adhesions , in which FN ﬁbrils are aligned with a 5 b 1 integrins , F - actin ﬁlaments and multiple sig - nalling molecules [ 15 , 26 , 27 ] ( for a review , see [ 28 ] ) . Interestingly , loss of a 5 b 1 integrin expression in cells and ablation of the a 5 integrin gene in mice revealed that FN can still be assembled by the remaining FN binding integrins , most notably the a v integrin subfamily [ 29 – 31 ] . In line with these ﬁndings , a double knockout of the a v and a 5 integrin genes results in a complete ablation of FN ﬁbril formation [ 32 ] . FN ﬁbrils produced by a v - class integrins appear short and thick and often resemble the shape and dynamic of a v integrin containing focal adhesions that may be attributed to the inability of these integrins to move out from focal adhesions [ 29 , 33 ] . An interesting and still unanswered question is whether a v - mediated thick and short FN ﬁbrils co - exist with the ﬁne and thin a 5 b 1 - mediated FN ﬁbrillar meshwork in vivo . The co - existence of different types of FN ﬁbrils would provide tissues with qualitatively different FN matrices implicating different functional properties . Another feature of a 5 b 1 integrins is their requirement for a binding site in addition to RGD on FN , called the synergy region , for obtaining maximum binding afﬁnity . This binding site comprises the PHSRN minimal sequence and is located in the ninth type III module adjacent to the RGD motif ( see Figures 1 and 2 ) ; [ 34 – 37 ] . Recent studies showed that the synergy region is not in contact with the a 5 b 1 integrin bound to FN and propose an indirect function of the synergy region for the high The role of integrin binding sites in fibronectin matrix assembly in vivo Leiss et al . 503 Figure 1 Schematic depiction of the modular structure of fibronectin . FN consists of three different modules ( type I , blue ; type II , brown ; type III , green ) . The alternatively spliced extradomains B , A , and variable region ( V ) are shown in ochre . The dimer forms via two disulfide bonds at the C - terminus . Integrin binding sites are indicated . The N - terminal type I domains marked with a red asterisk harbour an IGD motif . Binding domains for FN , collagen , fibrin , heparin and bacteria are indicated . Note that the a 5 b 1 as well as the a IIb b 3 integrins require the synergy region to bind to the RGD motif [ 36 ] . Besides providing a high affinity binding site for a v b 3 , the iso DGR motif in the fifth type I repeat also mediates low affinity binding to a 5 b 1 [ 44 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . It is unclear whether the low affinity binding is relevant in vivo . www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2008 , 20 : 502 – 507 afﬁnity binding of a 5 b 1 to FN by optimally exposing the ﬂexible RGD motif [ 38 ] , or by inducing long range electrostatic steering [ 39 ] . Mutations in the synergy region reduce a 5 b 1 integrin - mediated FN matrix assem - bly [ 40 ] , which could result from a shift from a 5 b 1 to a v integrin engagement , as the latter does not require the synergy region for optimal FN binding [ 35 , 41 ] . The role of the synergy region in development and physiology is unknown but can be tested with engineered mice expres - sing FN with a mutated synergy region . The discovery of new a v integrin binding site ( s ) in the N - terminus of FN Since the addition of RGD - containing peptides to cul - tured cells abolishes assembly of FN ﬁbrils [ 42 ] , it was proposed that the RGD motif of FN is required for FN binding to integrins and subsequent FN matrix assembly to proceed . This notion was supported by in vivo studies that demonstrated that FN ﬁbrillogenesis can proceed in mice null for either a 5 or a v , while deletion of both genes dramatically reduced the amount of the FN matrix in vivo [ 32 ] . On the basis of this in vitro and in vivo work one would have predicted that a non - functional RGD motif in FN would abrogate binding to both a 5 b 1 and a v integrins making ﬁbrillogenesis impossible as shown in the a 5 / a v double null mice . This hypothesis was tested in mice and cells that express a FN molecule , in which the RGD motif was substituted with an integrin binding inactive RGE motif [ 43 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Homozygous FN - RGE mice ( FN RGE / RGE ) die early during embryonic development with severe defects in the posterior mesoderm but have normal quantities of FN ﬁbrils in anterior mesoderm - derived structures [ 43 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . This phenotype resembles that of a 5 - null mice [ 19 ] , which use a v integrins to assemble FN ﬁbrils and indicated that there is an unknown a v integrin binding site somewhere along the FN - RGE containing molecule . By using solid - phase binding assays and recom - binant , soluble a v b 3 integrins , this site was located at the N - terminal FN polypeptide and encompasses the N - terminal type I domains ( FN - I 1 – 9 fragment ; also called 70 kDa fragment of FN ) . The FN - I 1 – 9 fragment is known to inhibit FN assembly with similar efﬁciency as RGD peptides . The inhibitory effect of FN - I 1 – 9 was attributed to the high afﬁnity binding sites for FN , which block FN – FN interactions required to align and crosslink FNs into ﬁbrils ( for a review , see [ 12 ] ) . Interestingly , two reports located poten - tial integrin binding sites in the FN - I 1 – 9 fragment . Curnis et al . identiﬁed an Asn - Gly - Arg ( NGR ) sequence in FN - I 5 ( see Figures 1 and 2 ) , which is converted to a high afﬁnity binding site for a v b 3 integrin through the deamidation and rearrangement of the asparagine residue and the creation of an iso DGR sequence [ 44 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Isoaspartate formation is a well known , non - enzymatic process that can occur during ageing of ECM proteins in vivo and during isolation and storage of proteins and can readily be reverted by the enzymatic action of the protein L - isoaspartyl methyltransferase ( PIMT ) [ 45 ] . Mass spectrometric analysis of puriﬁed , long - term stored plasma FN demonstrates iso DGR in FN - I 5 ( Brian Hoffmann and Deane Mosher , personal communication ) , suggesting that spontaneous deamidation also occurs in FN in vitro . More - over , structural studies show that the NGR / iso DGR motif is extending in a loop - like structure from the core of the FN - I 5 domain into the periﬁbrillar matrix where it would be easily accessible to integrins ( see Figure 2 ) . While FN deamidation represents an intriguing and attractive mech - anismfor tissuestoswiftlyactivatebindingsitesfor a v b 3to FN and spatially and temporally regulate FN - mediated a v integrin signalling , it has not been formerly shown that FN deamidation indeed occurs in vivo . Furthermore , it is also not known how deamidation is regulated in vivo and whether it requires physical or chemical changes in tissues , for example shifts in temperature or pH , to occur . 504 Cell - to - cell contact and extracellular matrix Figure 2 Schematic representation of selected FN domain pairs drawn with the RasMol Molecular Visualisation Program ( http : / / www . dcs . ed . ac . uk ) . Depicted in blue and cyan are the type I modules 4 – 5 and 8 – 9 , respectively . The proposed integrin binding motifs IGD and NGR are marked in red . The type III modules 9 – 10 ( coloured in green ) harbouring the synergy site ( PHSRN ) and the RGD motif ( both shown in red ) . The type I module pairs were drawn with coordinates from residues 1 – 93 , PDB 1FBR [ 71 ] and residues 485 – 572 ( [ 46 ] , and Iain Campbell , personal communication ) . The type III domain pair was drawn with coordinates from residues 1327 – 1509 , PDB 1fnf [ 72 ] . Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2008 , 20 : 502 – 507 www . sciencedirect . com Millard et al . identiﬁed an Ile - Gly - Asp ( IGD ) sequence in four type I domains of FN - I 1 – 9 that stimulate the moto - genic activity of ﬁbroblast ( see Figures 1 and 2 ) [ 46 ] . Although it is likely that this function is mediated by integrins , neither direct binding of IGD motif - containing FN polypeptides to recombinant integrins nor their role in the assembly of FN - RGE by FN RGE / RGE cells has been tested . Despite the uncertainty regarding the exact binding motif for the a v integrin in FN - I 1 – 9 the presence of such a site offers an explanation for the severe defects in the posterior mesoderm of FN RGE / RGE mice . FN RGE / RGE embryos develop 11 – 13 somites , which represent the transition from the primitive streak - to tail bud - derived mesoderm [ 47 ] . The development and / or survival of the primitive streak - derived mesoderm may be due to the expression of a v integrins , which are low in tail bud mesoderm ( [ 48 ] , and Amparo Giro´s , Reinhard Fa¨ssler , Mercedes Costell , unpublished observation ) . Thus , the expression of a v integrins by the primitive streak meso - derm and the presence of a novel a v integrin binding site in the FN - I 1 – 9 make the anterior trunk independent of a 5 b 1 integrin . The variable region of FN Some integrin - interaction sites within the FN meshwork can be regulated by alternative splicing within three different regions of FN ( see Figure 1 ) . One of them is the variable - region ( v - region ) , which can give rise to ﬁve different FN splice variants in man . The majority of cFN harbours a v - region in both subunits , while pFN contains only one subunit with a v - region . The v - region can associate with the two non - RGD - binding integrins , a 4 b 1 and a 4 b 7 , both of which bind the two minimal sequences LDV and REDV [ 49 , 50 ] . Interestingly , the recruitment of FN by a 4 b 1 is able to induce FN assembly in vitro , which is independent of the interaction of a 5 b 1 with the RGD motif [ 18 ] . It is unclear whether a 4 b 1 - mediated FN ﬁbrillogenesis is relevant in vivo . Mice carrying a disrupted a 4 integrin gene display an embryo - nic lethal phenotype with multiple defects , most of which are also observed in mice lacking vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM ) , which together with MadCAM are counter receptors of the a 4 integrins [ 51 , 52 ] . a 4 - null mice also display a vascular defect that is due to impaired interaction of pericytes with FN , which severely com - promises their migration [ 53 ] . Whether this defect is caused by an inappropriate assembly of FN ﬁbrils or by the absent signalling of a 4 integrins is unclear but can be tested by introducing mutations into the integrin binding sequences of the v - region . The extra domains ( ED ) A and B The alternatively spliced extra domain A ( EDA ) and extra domain B ( EDB ) are exclusively present in cFN ( see Figure 1 ) . Their expression levels are high during development and they progressively decrease after birth [ 54 – 56 ] . In pathological situations including cancer , ath - erosclerosis , thrombosis and pulmonary ﬁbrosis the expression of ED - containing FN is reactivated [ 57 – 61 ] . The EDGIHEL sequence of the EDA can facilitate binding to a 4 b 1 and a 9 b 1 integrins [ 24 , 62 ] ( Figure 1 ) . While the in vivo role of the integrin binding site in EDA has not been determined yet , ablation of either the entire EDA or EDB allows normal development , while ablation of both extra domains ( EDA and EDB ) leads to embryo - nic lethality with multiple cardiovascular defects [ 63 (cid:2) , 64 , 65 ] . Since deposition of FN ﬁbrils in the mutant embryos was unaffected it is likely that the integrin binding site in EDA is not essential for assembling a FN matrix . Heparan sulfate binding sites FN has two heparin binding domains that mapped to the ﬁrst ﬁve type I domains ( FN - I 1 – 5 ) and the three type III domains preceding the v - region ( FN - III 13 – 15 ) , respect - ively [ 10 ] ( see Figure 1 ) . Both domains facilitate the binding of proteoglycan cell surface receptors , most nota - bly members of the syndecan family . Syndecan - 2 and syndecan - 4 promote FN assembly via at least two mech - anisms . Firstly , they activate kinases such as PKC a and FAK that trigger integrin clustering and focal adhesion assembly [ 20 , 66 , 67 ] , and secondly , they crosstalk with ligated a 5 b 1 integrins to activate small GTPases such as RhoA and Rac1 that are required to generate sufﬁcient force to unfold FN molecules for the formation of a ﬁbrillar matrix [ 68 – 70 ] . Whether the interaction of syn - decans with FN by itself is sufﬁcient to induce FN ﬁbril formation has not been examined . The search for novel integrin - binding sites in FN The identiﬁcation of novel a v integrin binding motifs in the N - terminus of FN raises the questions why the site ( s ) remained undetected for such a long time , and how many additional integrin binding sites are still to be discovered in FN . The discovery of the novel integrin - binding site ( s ) in the N - terminus of FN was hampered by the fact that they share the same ligand binding pocket in integrins with RGD , and thus can be efﬁciently blocked with soluble RGD - containing peptides . Furthermore , the N - terminal binding sites ( s ) of FN lie in a region that contains important other non - integrin binding sites including interaction sites for heparin , collagen , and , most importantly , for FN itself . Thus , the inhibitory effect of FN - I 1 – 9 is attributed to inhibition of ‘self association’ sites , rather than an occupation of cell - sur - face integrins . Recombinant FN - fragments as well as recombinant integrins are important tools , which are now available to perform ELISA - or Surface Plasmon Resonance - based binding studies to precisely map binding sites .

This paper describes mice engineered to express a FN with an RGE motif in FN - III 10 . The mutant mice die at around E10 and display an a 5 integrin - null phenotype with a shortened posterior trunk . They assemble FN through a v integrin binding to FN - I 1 – 9 . isoDGR peptides were shown to inhibit FN - RGE ﬁbril formation in vitro suggesting that a v integrins bind to the deamidated NGR in FN - I 5 ( see next reference ) . 44 .

ThispaperidentiﬁedisoDGRinFN - I 5 asbindingsiteforintegrins . Thestudy shows that NGR requires deamidation to isoDGR for integrin binding and that a v integrins bind with high and a 5 b 1 with low afﬁnity to isoDGR . 45 .

This paper shows that expression of a FN molecule lacking the extra domains A and B in mice leads to an embryonic lethal phenotype with an apparently normal deposition of mutant FN . The lethality is caused by multiple cardiac defects , which are not present in mice lacking only one extra domain suggesting that the extradomains somehow compensate each other during development . 64 .
