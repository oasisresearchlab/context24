Cytokinetic abscission requires actin - dependent microtubule severing Tamara Advedissian 1 , Stéphane Frémont 1 , and Arnaud Echard 1 , (cid:0) 1 Institut Pasteur , Université Paris Cité , CNRS UMR3691 , Membrane Traffic and Cell Division Unit , 25 - 28 rue du Dr Roux , F - 75015 Paris , France Cell division is completed by the abscission of the intercellular bridge connecting the daughter cells . Abscission requires the polymerization of an ESCRT - III cone close to the midbody to both recruit the microtubule severing enzyme spastin and scis - sion the plasma membrane . Contrary to the common assump - tion , we found that the microtubule and the membrane cuts are two separate events and are regulated differently . We uncovered that the F - actin disassembling protein Cofilin - 1 controls the dis - appearance of a transient pool of branched F - actin which is pre - cisely assembled at the tip of the ESCRT - III cone just before the microtubule cut . Functionally , Cofilin - 1 and Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched F - actin favor abscission by promoting local severing of the microtubules but do not participate later in the mem - brane scission event . Mechanistically , branched F - actin func - tions as a physical barrier that limits ESCRT - III cone elonga - tion and thereby favors stable spastin recruitment . Our work thus reveals that F - actin unexpectedly controls the timely and local disassembly of microtubules required for cytokinetic ab - scission .

After complete furrow ingression driven by an actomyosin ring [ 1 , 2 ] , the daughter cells are connected by an intercellular bridge ( ICB ) filled with microtubules ( MTs ) . At the center of the ICB , an electron - dense structure named the midbody is a major platform which recruits all known pro - teins required for cell separation also called abscission [ 3 - 5 ] . In particular , the ESCRT - III ( Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport III ) machinery [ 6 - 10 ] localizes at the midbody , and highly dynamic ESCRT - III filaments polymer - ize as a cone - like structure extending from the midbody to constrict the ICB membrane until the final cut [ 11 - 17 ] . This site of constriction has been named the " secondary ingres - sion " or " abscission site " or " constriction zone " and is usu - ally located at a distance of 1 - 2 µm from the midbody [ 18 - 22 ] . Scission of the ICB often occurs successively on both sides of the midbody , releasing a " midbody remnant " that can be later tethered and phagocytosed [ 23 , 24 ] . Cytokinetic ab - scission requires a profound remodeling of the cytoskeleton at the ICB . Notably , both MTs and actin filaments ( F - actin ) must be removed to allow the ICB cut since the presence of these cytoskeleton elements would prevent local mem - brane fusion [ 16 ] . In addition to mediating membrane scis - sion , the ESCRT - III machinery contributes to the clearance of MTs at the secondary ingression by recruiting the MT severing AAA - ATPase spastin through direct binding with the ESCRT - III subunit CHMP1B [ 13 , 25 - 27 ] . In parallel , sev - eral pathways control global F - actin levels within the ICB by either limiting F - actin polymerization —through RhoA inactivation by p50RhoGAP or PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 hydrolysis by OCRL1— or triggering F - actin depolymerization —through actin oxidation by MICAL1 [ 19 , 28 - 32 ] . While many stud - ies demonstrated that global F - actin disassembly within the ICB is critical for abscission , it remains unclear whether F - actin might also play , likely locally , a role in abscission . Indeed , depending on the studies , experimental depolymer - ization of F - actin after complete furrow ingression using drugs led either to no effect , or to ICB instability followed by the formation of binucleated cells or to abscission de - fects [ 13 , 14 , 33 , 34 ] . Importantly , if F - actin is required for ab - scission , it remains to be discovered why at the mechanistic level . Here , we found that the F - actin disassembling protein Cofilin - 1 participates in cytokinetic abscission by regulating a transient pool of Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched F - actin at the secondary ingression . These findings thus reveal an unex - pected function of Cofilin - 1 in late steps of cytokinesis , long after furrow ingression during which Cofilin - 1 is well known to favor F - actin turnover [ 35 - 41 ] . Surprisingly , Cofilin - 1 and Arp2 / 3 promote abscission by controlling the severing of the MTs but not the membrane scission that we found to occur much later . Thus , abscission requires two temporally distinct events , a MT cut and a membrane cut , that are regulated sep - arately . Furthermore , our work reveals a critical and specific role of F - actin in the ESCRT - III - and spastin - dependent MT severing step required for abscission . Results Cofilin - 1 and F - actin are transiently enriched at the sec - ondary ingression We recently obtained the quantitative proteome of midbody remnants from HeLa cells , that we termed the Flemmingsome [ 21 ] . This helped to reveal the function of several proteins in abscission ( e . g . Syndecan - 4 , syntenin , Cavin1 , Caveolin - 1 ) [ 21 , 22 ] and post - abscission midbody remnant tethering to cells ( e . g . BST2 / Tetherin ) [ 42 ] . Here , we noticed that Cofilin - 1 was found enriched by two - fold in the Flemmingsome compared to control fractions , which suggested a potential function of this actin binding protein in late cytokinetic steps ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) .

As previously described [ 43 ] , Cofilin - 1 was detected at the cleavage furrow in 71 . 8 % ± 3 . 4 % of the dividing cells ( N = 4 independent experiments , n = 15 - 43 cells per exper - iment ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Remarkably , a thus far overlooked pool of Cofilin - 1 was also present in the ICBs at later stages of cytokinesis . Cofilin - 1 indeed localized at the midbody in 60 . 6 % ± 5 . 4 % ( N = 4 , n = 22 - 42 ) of late ICBs without yet secondary ingression ( i . e . with no pinch of the tubulin staining on the side of the midbody ) ( Fig . 1a , top panels ) . Furthermore , in 71 . 2 % ± 7 . 9 % ( N = 4 , n = 15 - 19 ) of older ICBs with secondary ingression , Cofilin - 1 was de - tected at the midbody and / or , intriguingly , at the secondary ingression itself ( Fig . 1a bottom panels , arrowhead ) . The latter localization was observed in approximately 30 % of ICBs with secondary ingression ( Fig . 1b ) , suggesting that Cofilin - 1 is transiently recruited at the secondary ingression . We confirmed the localization of Cofilin - 1 at the secondary ingression in primary BMEL ( Bipotential Mouse Embryonic Liver ) progenitor cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . To reveal the dynamic behavior of Cofilin - 1 in late cytoki - netic steps , we monitored HeLa cells that stably expressed wild type or mutant versions of human Cofilin - 1 tagged with GFP ( Cofilin - 1 - GFP ) by time - lapse spinning disk mi - croscopy . We observed that both wild type and active , non - phosphorylable Cofilin - 1 mutant ( Cofilin - 1 - S3A - GFP ) , ex - hibited a transient recruitment at the secondary ingression ( Fig . 1c arrowhead and Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . In contrast , the phospho - mimetic mutant ( Cofilin - 1 - S3E - GFP ) , which is inactive and had a lower affinity for actin [ 44 - 47 ] , did not localize to ICBs ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . This result suggested that Cofilin - 1 recruitment at the secondary ingres - sion was dependent on the binding of activated Cofilin - 1 to F - actin . Consistently , live cell microscopy in cells that stably co - expressed Cofilin - 1 - GFP and the F - actin probe LifeAct - mCherry showed that Cofilin - 1 and F - actin appeared and dis - appeared simultaneously at the secondary ingression ( Fig . 1d , arrowhead and Supplementary video 1 ) . In addition , treating the cells with Cytochalasin D ( CytoD ) —a drug that inhibits F - actin polymerization— strongly reduced F - actin levels in the ICBs and the proportion of ICBs with Cofilin - 1 at the secondary ingression ( Fig . 1e and Supplementary Fig . 1f ) . We conclude that Cofilin - 1 and F - actin are tran - siently enriched together at the secondary ingression and that Cofilin - 1 recruitment depends on F - actin . Cofilin - 1 contributes to abscission by regulating F - actin depolymerization To investigate a potential function of Cofilin - 1 in abscission , we depleted Cofilin - 1 using siRNAs ( Fig . 2a ) and used time - lapse phase contrast microscopy to measure the time it took after furrow ingression to physically cut the ICB . In our depletion conditions , approximately 22 % of the dividing cells became binucleated ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . Consistent with previous reports [ 38 , 40 , 48 ] , a frac - tion of binucleated cells arose before ICB formation either from instability of the ingressing furrow or from misposi - tioning of the contractile ring ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . We also observed that approximately 40 % of the binucle - ated cells resulted from late regression of the ICB , a phe - nomenon never reported before . This often occurred at a time after normal abscission ( i . e . > 250 min ) , indicating cytokine - sis abortion consecutive to failed abscission upon Cofilin - 1 depletion ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . Importantly , abscis - sion was delayed in Cofilin - 1 - depleted cells that did not be - come binucleated ( Fig . 2b ) . Transient expression of wild type Cofilin - 1 - GFP rescued normal timing of abscission in Cofilin - 1 - depleted cells ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . 2c ) , indicating a specific function of Cofilin - 1 in abscission . Moreover , active Cofilin - 1 - S3A - GFP mutant restored correct timing of abscission whereas the inactive form , Cofilin - 1 - S3E - GFP , did not ( Fig . 2c ) , showing that Cofilin - 1 activa - tion and binding to actin are required for Cofilin - 1 function in abscission . To rule out that the abscission delay resulted from indirect effects due to long term depletion of Cofilin - 1 by siRNAs , we took advantage of a chemogenetic method recently devel - oped49 to acutely deplete Cofilin - 1 from the cytosol only in cytokinesis and after furrow ingression . Briefly , we generated a stable cell line that expressed both siRNA - resistant Cofilin - 1 - GFP and engineered anti - GFP nanobodies anchored to the outer membrane of mitochondria ( Fig . 2d ) . After depletion of endogenous Cofilin - 1 , removal of trimethoprim ( TMP ) from the medium activated the nanobodies and thus led to a rapid ( < 5 min ) and massive sequestration of Cofilin - 1 - GFP from the cytosol to the mitochondrial surface ( Fig . 2d ) . Interestingly , acute depletion of Cofilin - 1 - GFP from the cy - tosol , after furrow ingression , delayed abscission ( Fig . 2e , siCofilin - 1 - TMP ) as compared to control conditions ( Fig . 2e , siCofilin - 1 + TMP and siControl ± TMP ) , similar to what we observed upon long - term depletion . Thus , acute de - pletion of Cofilin - 1 demonstrated a novel function of Cofilin - 1 after furrow ingression in promoting cytokinetic abscission . To determine whether Cofilin - 1 participates in abscission through depolymerization of F - actin , as expected for an actin disassembly factor , we treated the cells with low doses of the actin polymerization inhibitor Latrunculin A ( LatA ) . Re - markably , the addition of low doses ( 20 nM ) of Latrunculin A did not perturb cytokinetic abscission in control cells but re - stored proper timing of abscission in Cofilin - 1 - depleted cells ( Fig . 2f ) . We conclude that the disassembly of F - actin by Cofilin - 1 is important for abscission . Cofilin - 1 controls the local disassembly of branched F - actin at the secondary ingression just before the MT cut We next investigated the nature of the pool of F - actin colocalizing with Cofilin - 1 at the secondary ingression and whether Cofilin - 1 controls its dynamics . In fixed HeLa cells , F - actin at the secondary ingression co - localized with the sub - unit ARPC2 of the Arp2 / 3 complex , a major nucleator of actin filaments , primarily in the form of branches growing off the sides of other filaments ( branched F - actin ) [ 50 - 54 ] ( Fig . 3a , arrowhead ) . The presence of ARPC2 at the secondary ingression was also observed in mouse BMEL cells Advedissian et al . | Cytokinetic abscission requires actin - dependent microtubule severing 3 c a f 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 Time after furrow ingression ( min ) C u m u l a t i v e f r a c t i on o f c e ll s t ha t c o m p l e t ed ab sc i ss i on siControl siCofilin - 1 p < 0 . 0001 n . s . n . s . n . s . n . s . n . s . siControl siCofilin - 1 WT S3A S3E GFP WT S3A S3E GFP p < 0 . 0001 b 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 Time after furrow ingression ( min ) C u m u l a t i v e f r a c t i on o f c e ll s t ha t c o m p l e t ed ab sc i ss i on siControl + TMP siControl - TMP siCofilin - 1 + TMP siCofilin - 1 - TMP n . s . p = 0 . 0002 p = 0 . 015 p < 0 . 0001 p < 0 . 0001 n . s . + DMSO Figure 2 kDa M ean ab sc i ss i on t i m e ( m i n ) siControl siCofilin - 1 0 100 200 300 400 p < 0 . 0001 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 Time after furrow ingression ( min ) siControl + GFP siControl + Cofilin - 1 WT - GFP siControl + Cofilin - 1 S3A - GFP siControl + Cofilin - 1 S3E - GFP siCofilin - 1 + GFP siCofilin - 1 + Cofilin - 1 WT - GFP siCofilin - 1 + Cofilin - 1 S3A - GFP siCofilin - 1 + Cofilin - 1 S3E - GFP C u m u l a t i v e f r a c t i on o f c e ll s t ha t c o m p l e t ed ab sc i ss i on M ean ab sc i ss i on t i m e ( m i n ) + Cofilin - 1 - GFP + Cofilin - 1 - GFP d 0 100 200 300 400 500 + TMP : Cofilin - 1 - GFP is cytosolic - TMP : Cofilin - 1 - GFP is delocalized onto mitochondria 5 min 120 min Tom20 - SNAP - nanobodychannel Cofilin - 1 - GFP channel - TMP + TMP - TMP C u m u l a t i v e f r a c t i on o f c e ll s t ha t c o m p l e t ed ab sc i ss i on 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 Time after furrow ingression ( min ) siControl siCofilin - 1 siCofilin - 1 siControl + LatA M ean ab sc i ss i on t i m e ( m i n ) M ean ab sc i ss i on t i m e ( m i n ) 0 100 200 300 400 0 100 200 300 400 500 + TMP + TMP - TMP - TMP siControl siCofilin - 1 + DMSO + LatA siCofilin - 1 siControl siCofilin - 1 siControl 35 15 25 Cofilin - 1 s i C o f ili n - 1 s i C on t r o l 35 40 55 GAPDH e Fig . 2 .

Advedissian et al . | Cytokinetic abscission requires actin - dependent microtubule severing 5 ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Time - lapse spinning disk mi - croscopy in HeLa cells further established that the Arp2 / 3 subunit GFP - ARPC4 co - localized with Cofilin - 1 at the sec - ondary ingression ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary video 2 ) . Remarkably , Cofilin - 1 and Arp2 / 3 appeared simultaneously at the secondary ingression , displayed a maximal recruit - ment 5 minutes before the MT cut and completely disap - peared at the same time as MTs were cut ( Fig . 3c , time 0 corresponds to the time of the MT cut to allow compar - ison between cells ) . Both Cofilin - 1 and ARPC4 remained only for approximately 15 minutes at the secondary ingres - sion ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . The localization of an - other Arp2 / 3 subunit ( ARPC5 ) at the secondary ingression and its disappearance at the time of the MT cut were con - firmed in mouse 3T3 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . Of note , Arp2 / 3 can nucleate linear actin filaments upon acti - vation by SPIN90 [ 55 ] . However , we did not detect SPIN90 together with Arp2 / 3 or F - actin at the secondary ingression ( Supplementary Fig . 3d ) . We conclude that the F - actin that transiently accumulates with Cofilin - 1 at the secondary in - gression ( Fig . 1d ) likely corresponds to branched actin fila - ments that disassemble concomitantly with the MT severing . We next investigated whether Cofilin - 1 regulates the assem - bly / disassembly of branched F - actin at the secondary ingres - sion . Upon Cofilin - 1 depletion , the endogenous Arp2 / 3 sub - unit ARPC2 was detected at the secondary ingression in a greater proportion of ICBs ( Supplementary Fig . 3e ) , sug - gesting that ARPC2 remained longer at this location in the absence of Cofilin - 1 . Consistent with this hypothesis , live cell imaging in cells stably expressing GFP - ARPC4 showed an increase in the mean residence time of ARPC4 at the sec - ondary ingression before the MT cut in Cofilin - 1 - depleted cells ( Fig . 3d ) . Of note , Cofilin - 1 acted locally since its depletion did not impact global F - actin levels in the ICB ( Supplementary Fig . 3f ) , in accordance with the recruit - ment of Cofilin - 1 at the secondary ingression in late steps of cytokinesis . Together , these results indicate the existence of a local pool of branched F - actin at the secondary ingression just before the MT cut and show that Cofilin - 1 controls the disassembly of branched F - actin at this location . Cofilin - 1 promotes abscission by favoring MT severing through ESCRT - III - mediated recruitment of spastin but does not impact the membrane cut occurring later Since Cofilin - 1 , Arp2 / 3 and F - actin all appear transiently at the sec - ondary ingression and Cofilin - 1 depletion perturbs Arp2 / 3 dynamics before the MT cut , we hypothesized that Cofilin - 1 may influence abscission by regulating MT severing . When we monitored the MT cut using fluorescent SiR - Tubulin and the membrane cut ( actual abscission ) using phase contrast microscopy in the same cells throughout cytokinesis , we no - ticed that these are two clearly separate events ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary video 3 ) . This was unexpected since MT severing at the secondary ingression and abscission are gen - erally thought to occur simultaneously —or almost simulta - neously— in cultured cells ( see discussion ) . In contrast , we found that the MT cut happened on average 90 min after fur - row ingression , whereas the membrane cut occurred on av - erage 185 min later , with a broader time distribution in con - trol cells ( Fig . 4b siControl ) . Of note , for each individual cell , the MT cut always preceded the membrane cut but there was no correlation between the timing of these two events , suggesting that they are not directly coupled ( Supplementary Fig . 3g ) . Interestingly , silencing Cofilin - 1 strongly delayed the MT cut compared to control cells ( Fig . 4b , left panel solid curves and middle panel ) . However , when we mea - sured , for each cell , the time elapsed between the MT cut and the membrane cut , we did not observe any differences be - tween the control - and Cofilin - 1 - depleted cells ( Fig 4b , right panel ) . These results indicate that the delay in abscission ob - served upon Cofilin - 1 depletion is fully explained by a delay in cutting the MTs and suggest that Cofilin - 1 does not play a role once the MTs are cut . To demonstrate whether Cofilin - 1 promotes abscission by controlling the MT cut , we used the drug Batabulin which was shown to efficiently depolymerize the stable MTs present in the ICB , except in the very central part of the midbody [ 13 ] ( Fig . 4c ) . As previously reported [ 13 ] , the addition of Batab - ulin after complete furrow ingression in control cells was compatible with cell progression up to final abscission ( deter - mined by phase contrast ) with no delay compared to DMSO - treated cells ( Fig . 4d ) . Remarkably , the abscission delay ob - served upon Cofilin - 1 depletion was fully rescued when MTs were depolymerized using Batabulin ( Fig . 4d ) . We conclude that Cofilin - 1 promotes abscission by favoring MT severing but is not involved in the subsequent steps leading to abscis - sion . We next investigated how Cofilin - 1 influences the MT cut re - quired for abscission . First , we observed that the transient Cofilin - 1 pool present at the secondary ingression precisely localized at the tip of the ESCRT - III cone labeled by the CHMP4B subunit in fixed control cells ( Fig . 5a ) . Since the tip of the cone corresponds to the place where spastin will sever the MTs , we then analyzed whether Cofilin - 1 deple - tion might perturb ESCRT - III and spastin behavior . The ki - netics of appearance of the CHMP4B cone was not altered upon Cofilin - 1 depletion ( Fig . 5b , Time T1 ) but it took significatively more time for the cones to eventually trig - ger the MT cut ( Fig . 5b , Time T2 ) . This suggested that Cofilin - 1 depletion perturbed spastin recruitment and / or ac - tivity . Strikingly , we observed that the mean intensity of CHMP1B —the ESCRT - III component that recruits spastin during cytokinesis— was decreased in late ICBs with sec - ondary ingression in Cofilin - 1 - depleted cells compared to control cell , but unchanged in earlier ICBs without secondary ingression ( Fig . 5c ) . As a consequence , the downstream re - cruitment of spastin was reduced in late ICBs with secondary ingression but was unaffected in earlier ICBs ( Fig . 5d ) . We thus conclude that Cofilin - 1 promotes abscission by control - ling local MT severing through CHMP1B - dependent spastin recruitment at the secondary ingression . 6 Advedissian et al . | Cytokinetic abscission requires actin - dependent microtubule severing v v b a c d MT cut Abscission siControl siCofilin - 1 p = 0 . 013 p = 0 . 0009 n . s . p = 0 . 049 p = 0 . 013 n . s . 0 min 170min 150 min 100 min 70 min 60 min 40 min - 20 min S i R - T ubu li n P ha s e c on t r a s t P ha s e c on t r a s t S i R - T ubu li n MT cut Membrane cut ( abscission ) v C u m u l a t i v e f r a c t i on o f c e ll s t ha t c o m p l e t ed M T c u t o r ab sc i ss i on 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 Time after furrow ingression ( min ) siControl siCofilin - 1 siCofilin - 1 siControl M e an t i m e ( m i n ) 0 100 200 300 400 D i ff e r en c e be t w een t he t i m e o f ab sc i ss i on and t he t i m e o f M T c u t ( m i n ) MT cut MT cut Abscission Abscission a b a b siControl siCofilin - 1 0 100 200 250 150 50 Figure 4 0 min Addition of DMSO 50 min 10 min P ha s e c on t r a s t S i R - T ubu li n * * 0 min Addition of Batabulin 50 min 10 min * * Time after furrow ingression ( min ) 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 C u m u l a t i v e f r a c t i on o f c e ll s t ha t c o m p l e t ed ab sc i ss i on 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 + DMSO siControl siCofilin - 1 siCofilin - 1 siControl + Batabulin M ean ab sc i ss i on t i m e ( m i n ) 0 100 200 300 400 500 + DMSO + Batabulin siCofilin - 1 siControl siCofilin - 1 siControl Fig . 4 .

We next wondered whether the presence of this actin pool was required for abscission . In normal fixed dividing cells , the Arp2 / 3 subunit ARPC2 localized pre - cisely at the tip of the ESCRT - III cone labeled by its subunit IST1 ( Fig . 6a ) . As expected , ARPC4 and F - actin transiently accumulated at the tip of the ESCRT - III cone a few min - utes before the MT cut ( Fig . 6b and Supplementary Fig . 4a , arrowheads ) . Functionally , preventing the formation of branched F - actin by adding the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor CK666 after furrow ingression resulted in delayed abscission compared to DMSO - treated cells ( Fig . 6c ) . Furthermore , Arp2 / 3 inhi - bition delayed the MT cut after ESCRT - III cone formation but left unchanged the time elapsed between the MT cut and the membrane cut ( Fig . 6d and Supplementary Fig . 4b ) , indicating that once the MTs are cut , abscission occurs nor - mally after Arp2 / 3 inhibition . The abscission delay due to Arp2 / 3 inhibition could be fully rescued by depolymerizing the MTs with Batabulin ( Fig . 6e ) , showing that branched F - actin specifically favors the MT cut during abscission . To get further mechanistic insights , we next investigated whether Arp2 / 3 inhibition changed the behavior of spastin at the secondary ingression . We recorded spastin dynamics during cytokinesis by taking advantage of an inducible cell line that expressed low levels of GFP - spastin [ 56 ] . In control cells , spastin first accumulated at the midbody , then local - ized as a cone on one side of the midbody —consistent with spastin being recruited by CHMP1B there— and eventually concentrated at the tip of the cone before the MT cut ( Fig . 7a and Supplementary video 4 ) . Arp2 / 3 inhibition led to a de - lay between the arrival of spastin at the cone and the MT cut ( Fig . 7a and Supplementary video 4 ) , in agreement with the observed delay in the MT cut ( Fig . 6d ) and with a greater proportion of ICBs with endogenous spastin detected at the abscission site upon Arp2 / 3 inhibition ( Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . Remarkably , the mean intensity of endogenous spastin ( as well as CHMP1B ) at the secondary ingression was not modified but spastin localization appeared more elongated ( Fig . 7b , top and bottom left panels and Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . Furthermore , we noticed that spastin abnormally accumulated at the constriction site far away from the mid - body in CK666 - treated cells as compared to DMSO - treated cells ( Fig . 7b , top and bottom right panels ) . Altogether , we conclude that the delay in the MT cut observed upon Arp2 / 3 inhibition is associated with an abnormal spastin distribution ( shape and distance from the midbody ) at the secondary in - gression . Since spastin is recruited by CHMP1B and concentrates at the tip of the ESCRT - III cone , these results led us to hypothesize that Arp2 / 3 may control the behavior of ES - CRTs at the secondary ingression . Consistently , abnormally long CHMP1B - positive cones were observed upon Arp2 / 3 inhibition ( Fig . 7c ) . These strikingly long CHMP1B - positive cones were also observed upon actin depolymeriza - tion ( Supplementary Fig . 4e ) , arguing that branched F - actin normally sets the dimension of the ESCRT - III cone that poly - merize from the midbody to the secondary ingression . To further investigate the role of Arp2 / 3 in restraining the ex - tension of the ESCRT - III cone , we simultaneously recorded in live cells Arp2 / 3 ( with mApple - ARPC4 ) , ESCRT - III ( with CHMP4B - GFP ) and MTs ( with SiR - Tubulin ) as a function of time upon CK666 addition . In randomly picked control ( DMSO - treated ) cytokinetic cells that displayed a pool of Arp2 / 3 at the tip of the ESCRT - III cone at the beginning of the movie ( time 0 ) , we observed a limited growth of the cone before MTs were severed ( Supplementary video 5 , Fig . 7d and Fig . 7e i - each black curve corresponds to an individual cell ) . MT severing occurred within approxi - mately 15 min ( Fig . 7e ii - ) , at a distance of approximately 2 µm from the midbody ( Fig . 7e iii - ) . In contrast , in cells treated with CK666 , we observed 1 ) a disappearance of the Arp2 / 3 pool at the tip of the cone and 2 ) an abnormal growth of the ESCRT - III cone due to ESCRT - III polymerization for an extended period of time before MT were eventually sev - ered ( Supplementary video 5 , Fig . 7f and Fig . 7e i - green curves ) . MT severing occurred typically 30 - 70 min after the addition of the drug ( Fig . 7e ii - ) , at a distance of approxi - mately 4 µm ( Fig . 7e iii - ) . In addition , ESCRT - III cones de - tached more frequently from the midbody in CK666 - treated cells ( 26 . 9 % , n = 52 ) compared to DMSO - treated cells ( 9 . 8 % , n = 41 ) ( Chi2 contingency test : p = 0 . 037 ) . We propose that the Arp2 / 3 - positive branched F - actin pool present at the tip of the ESCRT - III cone limits its extension , thereby prevent - ing the sliding of spastin along the ICB and favors productive MT severing close to the midbody . This likely explains why in the absence of Arp2 / 3 , MTs are not severed properly and thus abscission is delayed . Discussion We reveal here a role of Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched F - actin together with Cofilin - 1 in promoting cytokinetic abscission through the specific regulation of MT severing at the sec - ondary ingression . To characterize the function of Cofilin - 1 and Arp2 / 3 in ab - scission , we monitored the MT cut and the membrane cut in the same dividing cells and realized that these two events are far from being simultaneous or almost simultaneous , as gen - erally assumed . Reported measurements of abscission tim - ing in cultured cells give various mean values depending on the technique that is used , even for a single cell type such as HeLa cells : ( 1 ) time - lapse imaging of fluorescently labelled tubulin [ 18 , 27 , 32 , 57 - 62 ] ; ( 2 ) measurement of cytoplasmic ex - change of photoactivable proteins between the two daugh - ter cells , which ceases after abscission or at least when the ICB diameter is small enough [ 13 , 63 ] ; or ( 3 ) time - lapse vi - sualization of the physical cut of the ICB ( membrane cut ) using phase contrast microscopy [ 19 , 28 - 30 , 64 , 65 ] . The ob - servation that the MT cut and the membrane cut are two sep - arated events likely explains the discrepancy in the timing of abscission between studies reported in the literature .

Advedissian et al . | Cytokinetic abscission requires actin - dependent microtubule severing 11 Whether F - actin has a function in the final steps of cy - tokinesis , after furrow ingression , is a long - standing ques - tion . The fact that F - actin must be globally disassem - bled within the ICB to promote abscission is well estab - lished [ 19 , 28 , 29 , 32 , 33 ] . In contrast , an active role of F - actin in abscission , likely locally and / or transiently , is still debated . In a seminal study describing the constricting role of ESCRT - III at the secondary ingression , the addition of the F - actin polymerization inhibitor Latrunculin B after furrow ingres - sion did not alter the timing of abscission [ 13 ] . In contrast , adding the F - actin polymerization inhibitor Cytochalasin D after furrow ingression increased binucleated cells forma - tion due to bridge regression after midbody formation , in - dicating that F - actin is required for late ICB stability and / or completion of abscission [ 34 ] . Furthermore , incubation with Blebbistatin after furrow ingression prevented the formation of the secondary ingression , indicating a role of myosin II and , presumably , F - actin in this process [ 66 ] . Failure to see a role of F - actin in late cytokinetic steps in some studies likely stems from differences in drugs or doses that have been used . Of note , continuous incubation of dividing cells with CK666 did not result in binucleated cells , suggesting that Arp2 / 3 is not required for furrow ingression nor for ICB stability , but whether it perturbed abscission had not been in - vestigated [ 33 ] . Here , we used time - lapse phase contrast mi - croscopy to visualize the actual physical cut of the ICB and treated the cells with CK666 after furrow ingression . This approach demonstrated that branched F - actin promotes ab - scission . Based on our localization data and functional analysis , we further involved two actin partners , the Arp2 / 3 complex and the actin disassembling protein Cofilin - 1 , in cytokinetic ab - scission . Using live cell imaging , we discovered a previously overlooked , transient pool of Cofilin - 1 and Arp2 / 3 , which appear together at the secondary ingression 15 - 20 min be - fore severing of the MTs . Furthermore , the disappearance of Cofilin - 1 and Arp2 / 3 at the secondary ingression occurs simultaneously with the MT cut —according to our time - resolution of 5 min— suggesting that these two events are tightly coupled . A spike of F - actin at the secondary in - gression in late cytokinetic steps has been previously re - ported [ 34 , 66 ] . However , the nature of this actin pool , its rela - tionship with MT disassembly and its precise role in abscis - sion remained unknown . We speculate that this pool likely corresponds to the Arp2 / 3 - F - actin pool that we characterized here . Remarkably , this actin pool precisely assembles at the tip of ESCRT - III cones . Interestingly , two components of Arp2 / 3 ( ARPC3 and ARPC5L ) and Cofilin - 1 have been re - cently identified by mass spectrometry upon coimmunopre - cipitation with CHMP4B during cytokinesis [ 67 ] . These in - teractions , either direct or indirect , might account for the ob - served overlap of Arp2 / 3 and Cofilin - 1 with the ESCRT - III machinery at the secondary ingression . How Arp2 / 3 and F - actin transiently accumulate at the secondary ingression ? Our data argue that Arp2 / 3 is not ac - tivated by the SPIN90 —which promotes Arp2 / 3 - dependent linear F - actin [ 55 ] — suggesting that Arp2 / 3 nucleates branched F - actin at the secondary ingression . Future investigations will nevertheless be required to determine how Arp2 / 3 is activated to assemble branched F - actin at this site . Since Cofilin - 1 is continuously present with Arp2 / 3 and F - actin at the secondary ingression for 15 - 20 min before the MT cut , it is likely that a balance of Arp2 / 3 activators and Cofilin - 1 regulates branched F - actin turnover at this location . Consistent with the known function of Cofilin - 1 in controlling F - actin disassembly and dissociation of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin branches [ 47 , 68 - 72 ] , we found that Cofilin - 1 depletion increases the residence time of Arp2 / 3 at the secondary ingression but does not increase F - actin levels all over the ICB . This is in agreement with the discrete localization of Cofilin - 1 at the secondary ingression . Importantly , low doses of the F - actin depolymerization drug Latrunculin - A ( which has no effect on abscission in control cells ) rescues the abscission delay observed in Cofilin - 1 depleted cells . This local function of Cofilin - 1 contrasts with a global regulation of Arp2 / 3 and F - actin in the whole ICB by the oxidoreductase MICAL1 [ 29 , 73 ] , which is known to synergize with Cofilin - 1 to disassemble F - actin in vitro [ 74 - 76 ] . Thus , MICAL1 and Cofilin - 1 appear to play distinct role during cytokinetic abscission . Of note , Arp2 / 3 acutely disappears from the secondary ingression concomitantly with the MT cut . This could be explained by an increase in Cofilin - 1 activity or by the in - activation of Arp2 / 3 activators at the time of the MT severing . Mechanistically , we propose that Arp2 / 3 together with Cofilin - 1 controls the timing of abscission by favoring the severing of the MTs at the secondary ingression ( Fig . 8 ) . In Cofilin - 1 - depleted cells and in CK666 - treated cells , ei - ther the recruitment or the behavior of spastin is impaired . Upon Cofilin - 1 depletion , Arp2 / 3 accumulates longer and it takes more time for ESCRT - III cones to trigger the MT cut . This is associated with a reduction of CHMP1B at the ICB , which likely explains the observed defective recruit - ment of spastin and the delay in the MT cut . Thus , proper disassembly and / or turnover of Arp2 / 3 at the secondary in - gression is important for correct CHMP1B and spastin re - cruitment there , possibly by setting CHMP1B incorporation and favoring proper ESCRT - III cone polymerization . Con - versely , removing Arp2 / 3 by adding CK666 does not impair spastin recruitment but profoundly alters its behavior , which also results in delaying MT severing . Using live cell imag - ing , we found that spastin is first recruited at the midbody , then accumulates at the tip of the ESCRT - III cone where it promotes local MT severing . This is the first description of spastin dynamics during cytokinesis . Both CK666 and Cy - tochalasin D treatments have a striking effect on the geometry of the ESCRT - III cone , which grows continuously from the midbody over several micrometers for an extended period of time . As a consequence , spastin at the tip of the cone contin - uously progresses away from the midbody . We hypothesize that this does not give enough time for spastin to sufficiently depolymerize MT at a given location , which thus delays MT severing . At the mesoscopic level , we thus speculate that 12 Advedissian et al . | Cytokinetic abscission requires actin - dependent microtubule severing Fig . 8 . Model : control of cytokinetic abscission by Cofilin - 1 , Arp2 / 3 and branched F - actin - dependent MT severing . Both Cofilin - 1 and Arp2 / 3 promote abscission by regulating the cut of the ICB MTs at the secondary ingression . Cofilin - 1 controls the disassembly of a transient pool of Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched F - actin at the tip of the ESCRT - III cone at the secondary ingression just before the MT cut . In the absence of Cofilin - 1 , this pool stays longer and CHMP1B - dependent recruitment of spastin is reduced . In the absence of Arp2 / 3 , the ESCRT - III cone continuously extends away from the midbody which impairs stable spastin recruit - ment and leads to abscission defects due to delayed MT severing . We propose that Arp2 / 3 limits the extension of the ESCRT - III cone by acting as a physical barrier at the secondary ingression , thus favoring the MT cut . the branched F - actin meshwork acts as a physical barrier that blocks the abnormal extension of the ESCRT - III poly - mers . To our knowledge , the Arp2 / 3 pool at the tip of the ESCRT - III cone is the first reported regulatory component that sets the dimensions of the ESCRT - III cone , which ap - pears critical to control spastin activity . Altogether , these re - sults highlight the local requirement of Cofilin - 1 and Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched F - actin in abscission by controlling the correct recruitment and stability of the spastin pool at the sec - ondary ingression . In summary , our results unambiguously demonstrate a criti - cal role of the actin cytoskeleton in the late steps of cytokine - sis . Remarkably , branched F - actin and Cofilin - 1 were found to be specifically required for the MT cut . To our knowl - edge , this represents the first crosstalk between the actin and MT cytoskeleton via ESCRT polymers . We conclude that cy - tokinetic abscission can be divided into two distinct steps , a MT cut and a membrane cut , which are controlled by distinct molecular machineries .

Advedissian et al . | Cytokinetic abscission requires actin - dependent microtubule severing 13 Immunofluorescence and image acquisition HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and fixed either with paraformalde - hyde ( PFA ) 4 % for 20 min at room temperature or with ice - cold methanol for 2 - 3 min ( see Supplementary Table 1 ) . Cells were then permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 when necessary , blocked with PBS containing 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) and successively incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary ( see Supplementary Table 1 ) and secondary antibodies ( 1 : 500 , Jackson Laboratory ) diluted in PBS containing 1 % BSA before DAPI staining for 5min ( 0 . 5 mg / ml , Serva ) . Cells were mounted in Fluoromount G ( Southern Biotech ) . For endogenous staining of ARPC2 , cells were first fixed with 4 % PFA + 0 . 5 % Triton - X100 for 1 . 5 min before incubation with 4 % PFA for 15 min . Images were acquired with an inverted TiE Nikon microscope , using a x60 or a ×100 1 . 4 NA PL - APO objective lens and Meta - Morph software ( MDS ) driving either a CCD camera ( Photo - metrics Coolsnap HQ ) or a Retiga R6 CCD camera ( Teledyne Photometrics ) . Alternatively , images were acquired on an in - verted Nikon Eclipse Ti - E microscope equipped with a CSU - X1 spinning disk confocal scanning unit ( Yokogawa ) coupled to either a Prime 95S scientific complementary metal - oxide semiconductor ( sCMOS ) camera ( Teledyne Photometrics ) or a EMCCD Camera ( Evolve 512 Delta , Photometrics ) . Im - ages were then converted into RGB 8 - bit images using Im - ageJ software ( NIH ) and resampled to 300ppi using Adobe Photoshop ( bicubic method ) . Image and data analysis All images and videos were ana - lyzed with the Fiji software . Mean intensity values were ex - tracted from manually drawn ROIs for each channel of inter - est using Fiji and mean background intensity was subtracted . The scan lines were obtained using an ROI ( straight line ) , with a width corresponding to the bridge after subtraction of the background intensity . Intensity values were normalized to control condition or to the maximal intensity measured as in - dicated in the figure legends . Illustrations were created with BioRender . com . Time - lapse microscopy For time - lapse phase - contrast imaging , cells were plated for 48 hours on glass bottom 12 - well plates ( MatTek ) and put in an open chamber ( Life Imag - ing ) equilibrated in 5 % CO2 and maintained at 37 °C . Cells were recorded every 10 min for 48 hours using an inverted Nikon Eclipse TiE microscope with a ×20 0 . 45 NA Plan Fluor ELWD or a x40 0 . 95 NA PL - APO objectives controlled by Metamorph software ( Universal Imaging ) . To determine abscission times , we used the phase contrast channel and measured the time elapsed from the first image after complete furrow ingression until the occurrence of the membrane cut of the ICB , which is usually accompanied by a sudden change in orientation of the midbody . To determine the MT cut time , the culture medium was changed and 25 - 100 nM of fluores - cent SiR - tubulin ( SC002 , Spirochrome ) were added at least 6 hours before recording . We then measured both the MT cut and the membrane cut in the same cells , starting from com - plete furrow ingression up to the occurrence of the first cut of the microtubules on one side of the midbody visualized by the SiR - tubulin signal in the fluorescent channel . Drugs were added ( 2 µM Batabulin or 160 µM CK666 ) or washed - out ( 10 µM TMP = Trimethoprim ) after complete furrow ingression using two protocols : In Fig . 4d , 6d and 6e , mitotic cells were randomly picked and recorded for 24 hours every 10 min and drugs were added between timepoint 30 and 40 min , thus af - ter completion of furrow ingression ; In Fig . 2e and 6c , cells were synchronized by mitotic shake : from 80 % confluent flasks , a first mitotic shake was performed to remove debris and dead cells . One hour later , a second mitotic shake was performed to harvest mitotic cells . Metaphase cells were then plated on a collagen - coated glass surface and let to adhere at 37 °C . Next , the medium with or without drugs was changed and cells were recorded 60 min after replating every 10 min for 24 hours on randomly picked cells . Only cells with al - ready fully ingressed furrow were analyzed ( Fig . 2e , 6c ) . To visualize protein localization by time - lapse fluorescent mi - croscopy , cells were recorded with an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti - E microscope equipped with a CSU - X1 spinning disk con - focal scanning unit ( Yokogawa ) and with either an EMCCD ( Evolve 512 Delta , Photometrics ) or a Prime 95S sCMOS camera ( Teledyne Photometrics ) . Images were acquired with 100× 1 . 4 NA PL - APO or 60× 1 . 4 NA PL - APO VC objectives and MetaMorph software ( MDS ) . 25 - 100 nM of fluorescent SiR - Tubulin were added and incubated at least 6 hours be - fore recording . SNAP - Cell 647 - SiR substrate ( S9102S New England Biolabs ) was used to reveal SNAP - tag following the manufacturer’s instructions . For live cell experiment pre - sented Fig . 7a , 7d and 7f DMSO or 200µM CK666 was added between the first and the second timepoint after start - ing the acquisition .

Scale bar = 5 µm . Bottom : T1 and T2 ( min ) ± SD in indicated cells , n = 4 - 45 cells per condition , N = 4 independent experiments ( violin plots ) . Two - tailed unpaired Student t test with Welch’s correction . n . s . = non - significant ( p > 0 . 05 ) . ( c ) Top : Staining of endogenous spastin and Tubulin in ICBs with secondary ingressions . Spastin patterns can be classified in 3 categories : absent / diffuse , cone , dot at the secondary ingression only . Arrowhead : secondary ingression . Yellow arrowhead : spastin cone at the midbody side . Scale bars : 2 µm . Bottom : Percentage of ICBs with secondary ingression displaying each category of spastin localization in cells incubated with either DMSO or 200 µM CK666 for 2 hours . Mean ± SD , n = 13 – 21 cells per condition , N = 4 independent experiments . Two - way ANOVA with Sidak multiple comparisons test . Adjusted p - values are represented . ( d ) Mean fluorescence intensity of CHMP1B ( arbitrary units ) at the midbody ( late ICBs without secondary ingression ) or at the midbody + secondary ingression ( late ICBs with secondary ingression ) in cells treated with either DMSO or 200 µM CK666 for 2 hours . Mean ± SD , n = 8 - 21 cells per condition , N = 3 independent experiments ( violin plots ) . Intensities are normalized in each experiment to the mean intensity of DMSO - treated cells in late ICB without secondary ingression . One - way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons test . n . s . = non - significant ( p > 0 . 05 ) . ( e ) Left : Staining of endogenous CHMP1B and Tubulin in cells treated with either DMSO or 0 . 4 µM Cytochalasin D ( CytoD ) for 1 hour prior to fixation . Scale bars = 5 µm . Arrowhead : secondary ingression . Right : Distance d ( µm ) between the midbody center and the tip of the CHMP1B cone in indicated cells . Mean ± SD , n = 9 – 27 ICBs with a secondary ingression per condition , N = 3 independent experiments ( violin plots ) . Two - tailed unpaired Student t test .
