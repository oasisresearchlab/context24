This article is published with open access Abstract Genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) of quantitative electrocardiographic ( ECG ) traits in large consortia have identi ﬁ ed more than 130 loci associated with QT interval , QRS duration , PR interval , and heart rate ( RR interval ) . In the current study , we meta - analyzed genome - wide association results from 30 , 000 mostly Dutch samples on four ECG traits : PR interval , QRS duration , QT interval , and RR interval . SNP genotype data was imputed using the Genome of the Netherlands reference panel encompassing 19 million SNPs , including millions of rare SNPs ( minor allele frequency < 5 % ) . In addition to many known loci , we identi ﬁ ed seven novel locus - trait associations : KCND3 , NR3C1 , and PLN for PR interval , KCNE1 , SGIP1 , and NFKB1 for QT interval , and ATP2A2 for QRS duration , of which six were successfully replicated . At these seven loci , we performed conditional analyses and annotated signi ﬁ cant SNPs ( in exons and regulatory regions ) , demonstrating involvement of cardiac - related pathways and regulation of nearby genes . Introduction Quantitative electrocardiographic ( ECG ) traits have been well studied in large consortia , identifying over 130 sig - ni ﬁ cant loci . Some loci were associated with multiple traits . Nevertheless , these loci collectively explain only a small portion of the genetic variation of these traits [ 1 ] . Large GWAS meta - analyses on PR interval [ 2 , 3 ] , RR interval / heart rate [ 4 , 5 ] , QRS duration [ 6 , 7 ] , and QT interval [ 8 – 10 ] were based on HapMap imputations [ 11 ] . Testing ~ 2 . 5 million SNPs , these studies provided good coverage of common variation in the genome . SNPs with lower allele frequencies ( e . g . , minor allele frequencies between 1 and 5 % ) , however , are poorly covered [ 12 , 13 ] . * Jessica van Setten J . vanSetten @ umcutrecht . nl * Aaron Isaacs a . isaacs @ maastrichtuniversity . nl Extended author information available on the last page of the article . Supplementary information The online version of this article ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41431 - 018 - 0295 - z ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users . 1234567890 ( ) ; , : 1234567890 ( ) ; , : While HapMap included only 270 samples ( 30 trios and 90 unrelated samples ) from three continental populations [ 11 ] , the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 contains 2504 samples from 26 populations [ 14 ] . Larger reference panels cover a broader variety of haplotypes and , there - fore , increase the quality of imputation in a GWAS sample . Moreover , the number of observed SNPs also increases , expanding the number available for imputation . This has led to novel ﬁ ndings in non - ECG related studies [ 15 ] . In the current study , we meta - analyzed genome - wide data on four ECG traits in 30 , 000 predominantly Dutch samples . We tested over 19 million SNPs for association , which were imputed using the Genome of the Netherlands ( GoNL ) reference panel [ 16 ] . This dataset contains whole - genome sequencing data at 12x coverage collected in 250 families ( trios and parents with two offspring ) . Nearly all poly - morphic sites with a population frequency of more than 0 . 5 % are captured . This makes it one of the largest single popu - lation sequencing efforts worldwide and the trio design ensures very accurate haplotype phasing . These features and the good match with the predominantly Dutch cohorts , make this dataset well suited as a reference panel for imputation . Using this approach , we had two aims : ( 1 ) the discovery of novel loci associated with ECG traits , and ( 2 ) the ﬁ ne - mapping and functional annotation of known regions asso - ciated with ECG traits . We increased our SNP density almost seven - fold compared to previous studies based on HapMap , enabling us to study key signals in much ﬁ ner detail . Methods Individual cohort data Eight cohorts were included in the discovery phase of this study , totaling approximately 30 , 000 samples ( Supple - mentary Tables 1 and 2 , Supplementary Notes ) . Most study participants were Dutch with the exception of most parti - cipants of PROSPER ; this study included approximately 19 % samples of Dutch origin , while the remaining samples were of other European descent . All cohorts performed stringent quality control to exclude low - quality samples and SNPs prior to imputation and also post - imputation . Impu - tation was performed using 998 phased haplotypes from the Genome of the Netherlands Project release 4 as the refer - ence panel , encompassing 19 , 763 , 454 SNPs [ 16 ] . All genomic data in this manuscript is listed with respect to the hg19 ( build37 ) reference genome . We evaluated four phenotypes on the electrocardiogram : RR interval , PR interval , QRS duration , and QT interval . Seven out of eight cohorts contributed data to all four phenotypes ; NTR only had data on RR interval available . Samples of non - European descent and samples with miss - ing data were excluded , as well as individuals that ful ﬁ lled any of the exclusion criteria listed in Supplementary Table 3 . SNPs were individually tested for association with each trait using linear models . For all four phenotypes , we included age , sex , height , BMI , and study speci ﬁ c covari - ates ( for instance to correct for study site , relatedness , or population strati ﬁ cation ) as covariates . In addition , RR interval and hypertension ( in those cohorts that had data available on this measure ) were included as covariates for QT interval to reduce noise introduced by these factors . We chose these covariates to correspond with previously pub - lished GWAS on these four ECG traits . Quality control and meta - analysis Association results from all cohorts were collected at a single site and underwent quality control . SNPs with extreme values of beta ( > 1000 or < − 1000 ) , standard error ( SE ) ( > 1000 ) , or imputation quality ( < 0 . 1 or > 1 . 1 ) were removed and dis - tributions of beta , SE , and P - values were manually checked . We made QQ - plots to test P - value distributions , which were strati ﬁ ed by minor allele frequency and by imputation qual - ity . Aberrant subsets of SNPs ( usually with very low fre - quency ) were removed from downstream analyses . Inverse - variance ﬁ xed - effect model meta - analyses were conducted for all four traits using MANTEL [ 17 ] . For each individual GWAS , genomic in ﬂ ation factors ( lambda ) were calculated and , during meta - analysis , standard errors were adjusted accordingly to correct for population structure and technical errors . We did not correct for genomic in ﬂ ation after meta - analysis . SNP associations were considered sig - ni ﬁ cant if P ≤ 5 × 10 – 8 . Follow - up on known and novel loci For each locus , we tested the number of independent signals using the LD structure from GoNL in GCTA - COJO , which was designed to allow conditional analyses based on summary - level data [ 18 ] . Secondary hits had to ful ﬁ ll two criteria : ( 1 ) genome - wide signi ﬁ cant in the GWAS , and ( 2 ) P < 1 × 10 – 5 after conditioning to correct for multiple testing of 4757 signi ﬁ cant SNPs across all four traits . A novel locus for a trait was de ﬁ ned if the signi ﬁ cant SNPs , or SNPs within a distance of 1 Mb upstream and downstream of the signi ﬁ cant SNPs , had not been observed before in GWAS of the same trait . We performed a look - up of all novel loci in previous HapMap - based GWAS . Replication of novel loci in CHARGE We sought to replicate our ﬁ ndings in 13 independent cohorts taking part in the CHARGE consortium [ 19 ] Genome - wide association meta - analysis of 30 , 000 samples identi ﬁ es seven novel loci for quantitative . . . 953 ( Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 , Supplementary notes ) . Twelve studies ( TwinsUK , CHS , ARIC , KORA F3 , KORA S4 , JHS , AGES , BRIGHT , YFS , INGI - FVG , and INGI - CARL ) used 1000 Genomes Phase 1 as their imputation reference panel and a single study ( Inter99 ) provided only genotyped data . All studies contained samples of European ancestry , except for JHS , which consisted only of African - American samples . The summary - level results for all novel SNPs determined in the discovery analysis were combined in inverse - variance ﬁ xed - effects meta - analyses . A two - sided P - value ≤ 0 . 05 , in conjunction with a concordant effect direction , was considered signi ﬁ cant . In silico tests of possibly functional SNPs We looked up the functional annotations for all SNPs that reached genome - wide signi ﬁ cance in any of the four traits . First , we checked whether SNPs were potentially damaging to protein function , testing all non - synonymous SNPs in SIFT [ 20 ] and PolyPhen - 2 [ 21 ] . Second , we used GREAT [ 22 ] to identify biological pathways in which regulatory SNPs are involved , testing the index SNPs for all locus - trait associations . Lastly , we tested all signi ﬁ cant SNPs one by one for their possible effect on regulatory regions using RegulomeDB [ 23 ] . Results Meta - analysis detects novel loci We conducted a GWAS meta - analysis comprising eight cohorts that together encompassed approximately 30 , 000 samples . Over 19 million SNPs , imputed using the GoNL reference panel , were assessed for association with four quantitative ECG traits : RR , PR , QRS , and QT . Con - sidering all traits , we observed 52 locus - phenotype asso - ciations ( 17 for PR , 13 for QRS , 15 for QT , and 7 for RR ; Supplementary Figures 1 and 2 , Supplementary Table 4 ) . A locus was de ﬁ ned as an associated region ( containing one or more SNPs with P ≤ 5 × 10 – 8 ) that is located at least 1 Mb away from the next ( i . e . , if two associated SNPs are within 1 Mb , they belong to the same locus ) . Of these 52 loci , 45 have been observed before in large GWAS meta - analyses [ 2 – 4 , 7 – 9 ] and seven are novel ﬁ ndings ( Table 1 ) . Box 1 shows regional association plots and provides additional information on the seven novel loci . Imputation qualities of the index SNPs were 0 . 60 and 0 . 84 for the relatively rare KCNE1 and KCDN1 variants , respectively , and > 0 . 96 for the remaining common index SNPs . The variance explained by each of these variants ranges between 0 . 09 and 0 . 23 % . Fine - mapping of known loci For each locus , we tested if more than one independent signal was present ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Thirteen loci had suggestive evidence of having more than one inde - pendent signal ; four locus - phenotype associations had ﬁ ve or more independent signals . The SCN5A / SCN10A locus was the most outstanding locus with eleven independent signals for PR , and six for QRS . NOS1AP for QT contained seven independent signals . Replication in CHARGE For six out of seven novel loci , we were able to conduct look - ups of the index SNP or a proxy SNP in strong LD ( r 2 ≥ 0 . 89 ) in previous large - scale HapMap - based GWAS . These GWAS contained over 70 , 000 samples each , and included many of the Dutch cohorts from our current study . All six loci were associated with their respective traits ( P ≤ 0 . 004 ) . Next , we tested the seven novel loci for replication in 13 studies from the CHARGE consortium . In contrast to the HapMap look - ups , this replication was independent from the Dutch discovery sample . Results are shown in Table 1 . Allele frequencies were very similar to the dis - covery dataset , except for JHS , which consists of indivi - duals of African - American descent . Effect directions for all seven SNPs were concordant between our primary ﬁ ndings and replication , with effect sizes between 0 . 2 and 1 . 5 times those of the betas in the discovery study . Six of seven loci were replicated with P < 0 . 05 , three of which pass Bonfer - roni correction , accounting for seven tests . Functional SNPs in genes and regulatory regions All genome - wide signi ﬁ cant SNPs were tested in silico for their potential effect on gene expression and protein struc - ture . Ten loci contained , in total , 15 non - synonymous SNPs , which were tested using the prediction programs PolyPhen - 2 and SIFT . According to PolyPhen - 2 , three SNPs were pos - sibly damaging ( rs1805128 in KCNE1 for QT , rs12666989 in UFSP1 for RR , and rs2070492 in SLC22A14 for PR ) . SIFT predicted only one SNP to be damaging to a protein ( rs3746471 in KIAA1755 for RR ) . We used GREAT to test all 100 index SNPs from the four ECG traits combined for their biological function in cis - regulatory regions . Signi ﬁ cant GO - terms ( molecular function , biological process , and cellular component ) , human phenotypes , and disease ontologies are shown in Supplementary Table 5a – d . In total , these index SNPs mapped to 103 genes . Of 52 locus - phenotype associations , 34 contained sig - ni ﬁ cant SNPs that have a RegulomeDB score of 3 or better , 954 J . van Setten et al .

We observed 15 loci containing SNPs with scores of 1 ( likely to affect binding and linked to the expression of a gene target ) , 15 loci containing SNPs with a maximum score of 2 ( likely to affect binding ) , and four loci that have SNPs with a maximum score of 3 ( less likely to affect binding ) . Eighteen loci contained only SNPs with scores from 4 to 6 ( minimal binding evidence ) and 7 ( no data available ) . Discussion We imputed over 19 million SNPs using GoNL as the reference panel , and tested these SNPs for association with four traits in eight predominantly Dutch cohorts comprising roughly 30 , 000 samples . We observed 52 locus - phenotype associations , seven of which were novel ( Table 1 , Box 1 , Supplementary Table 4 ) . Discovery of loci associated with quantitative ECG traits We detected seven novel loci , three for PR interval , three for QT interval , and one for QRS duration ( Box 1 ) . No novel loci were found for RR interval , accounting for loci previously associated with either RR interval [ 4 ] or heart rate [ 5 ] . We replicated six out of seven novel loci utilizing 13 independent studies from the CHARGE consortium . Interestingly , the only variant that does not replicate is rs74640693 for PR interval , located close to PLN ( phos - pholamban ) . Variants in this gene have been consistently associated with various QRS measures [ 6 ] but not with PR interval . The gene transcribes the phospholamban protein , which is important in calcium signaling in cardiac muscle cells [ 24 ] . Although a Dutch - speci ﬁ c pathogenic mutation , p . Arg14del , in the PLN gene has been described [ 25 ] , it is unlikely that this mutation drives the association signal in our study because the allele frequency of SNP rs74640693 Box 1 Seven novel loci were identi ﬁ ed ; three for PR , three for QT , and one for QRS . Information and regional association plots are shown for every locus . Each SNP is plotted with respect to its chromosomal location ( hg19 , x - axis ) and its P - value ( y - axis on the left ) . The tall blue spikes indicate the recombination rate ( y - axis on the right ) at that region of the chromosome . We observed two independent signals at the KCND3 gene . The ﬁ rst signal consists of low - frequency SNPs ( MAF < 3 . 8 % , index SNP MAF = 2 . 4 % ) upstream of KCND3 ( top ) , while the second signal contains intronic SNPs with much higher allele frequencies ( index SNP MAF = 19 . 6 % , bottom ) . KCND3 encodes voltage - gated potassium channel subunit K v 4 . 3 . SNPs near KCND3 have been associated with P - wave duration and ST - T wave amplitude [ 29 ] , and with Atrial Fibrillation in the Japanese population [ 30 ] . It is thought that KCND3 overexpression may be involved in Brugada syndrome because of its direct interaction with KCNE3 . This gene inhibits KCND3 , and speci ﬁ c mutations in the latter gene lead to Brugada syndrome [ 31 , 32 ] . Moreover , it has been shown that mutations in KCND3 cause spinocerebellar ataxia [ 33 ] ( Fig . 1a , b ) . The association signal in this locus spans the NR3C1 gene , with the two genome - wide signi ﬁ cant SNPs located between NR3C1 and ARHGAP26 . Both SNPs are common , with MAFs of approximately 45 % . NR3C1 encodes the glucocorticoid receptor , which interacts with a wide variety of proteins , transcription factors , and other cellular compounds [ 34 ] . In mice , this gene is involved in cardiac development [ 35 ] , and overexpression causes ECG abnormalities [ 36 ] , which makes it likely that this is the gene underlying the association signal . ARHGAP26 encodes GRAF protein ( GTPase Regulator Associated with Focal Adhesion Kinase ) , which is required in speci ﬁ c exo - and endocytosis pathways [ 37 ] , but also for muscle development [ 38 ] . Mutations in this gene have been implicated in leukemia [ 39 ] ( Fig . 1c ) . Fig 1d : This locus has been associated previously with RR interval [ 4 ] , QT interval [ 8 , 9 ] , and QRS duration [ 7 ] . The index SNP has a MAF of 5 . 4 % and the association signals spans SLC35F1 and PLN . The latter gene encodes phospholamban , which is an important regulator of cardiac contractility [ 40 ] . SLC35F1 encodes a transporter protein that is highly expressed in the human brain [ 41 ] ( Fig . 1d ) . Although only one ( common , MAF = 32 . 2 % ) SNP reached genome - wide signi ﬁ cance , SNPs in strong LD with the index SNP span an area of almost 500 kb , covering many genes . This locus has been associated with QT interval previously [ 10 ] . Our most signi ﬁ cant SNP is located just downstream of ATP2A2 , a strong candidate gene in this region that encodes a SERCA Ca 2 + ATPase , which is involved in calcium transport in the human heart and under regulation of phospholamban [ 42 ] ( Fig . 1e ) . This locus spans ~ 300 kb in between two recombination hotspots . Signi ﬁ cant SNPs are in almost complete LD with each other , with minor allele frequencies of approximately 15 % . The locus spans two genes , SGIP1 and TCTEX1D1 . SGIP1 encodes a proline - rich endocytic protein that interacts with endophilin and is involved in energy homeostasis [ 43 , 44 ] . This gene is mainly expressed in the human brain [ 43 ] and has been associated with fat mass [ 45 ] . The TCTEX1D1 gene belongs to the dynein light chain Tctex - type family and has an unknown function ( Fig . 1f ) . The most signi ﬁ cant SNPs in this locus are located upstream of the NFKB1 gene , encoding the NF - kappa - B p105 subunit . SNPs in this locus are common ( MAF = 43 . 5 % ) . An indel in the promotor of this gene has been associated with coronary heart disease [ 46 ] and dilated cardiomyopathy [ 47 ] . This particular indel is in moderate LD with the index SNP in this locus ( r 2 in GoNL = 0 . 4 ) . NFKB1 is a transcription factor is involved in many immune - and tumor - related processes , and has been associated with ulcerative colitis [ 48 ] and bladder cancer [ 49 ] ( Fig . 1g ) . This locus contains a low frequency SNP ( MAF = 1 . 7 % ) with a large effect on QT interval . This SNP has been observed in GWAS before , but could not be replicated ( in this [ 8 ] and later studies [ 10 ] ) because it was poorly imputed so only cohorts that genotyped the SNP directly could be included [ 8 ] . KCNE1 encodes a voltage - gated potassium channel , and the index SNP encodes a pathogenic Asp to Asn amino acid substitution at position 85 of KCNE1 , causing long QT syndrome 5 [ 50 ] ( Fig . 1h ) . 956 J . van Setten et al . is similar in our samples ( 4 . 9 % ) compared to other samples of European ancestry ( 4 . 6 % in the 12 European CHARGE replication cohorts ) . Furthermore , the allele frequency of this SNP is ~ 5 times higher than that of the mutation and the SNP is located ~ 200 kb upstream of the PLN gene , so , therefore , not in LD with these mutations .

To con ﬁ rm that the lack of association was not caused by strand issues ( because rs74640693 is an A / T variant ) , we tested the nearby proxy SNP rs12210733 ( which is an A / G variant , r 2 = 0 . 89 ) in the CHARGE replication cohorts , and found it was also non - signi ﬁ cant . We looked up our top SNPs in previous , much larger , HapMap - based GWAS meta - analyses to determine why our SNPs were not identi ﬁ ed in those studies ( Table 1 ) . Two loci contained rare SNPs with MAF < 5 % . Low - frequency SNPs at KCND3 were not present in HapMap and could therefore not be tested . The functional SNP at KCNE1 was observed in a single cohort in a meta - analysis in 2009 , but this result could neither be replicated in other cohorts [ 9 ] , nor in later studies , because the imputation quality was too low . For common SNPs ( MAF > 5 % ) , it is much more dif ﬁ - cult to de ﬁ ne why they were not previously observed at genome - wide signi ﬁ cance . For many loci we may have better tags of the causal variants because our coverage is almost sevenfold greater . Indeed , the index SNPs at PLN ( PR ) , NFKB1 ( QT ) , and ATP2A2 ( QRS ) were not tested in previous studies . Nevertheless , for all SNPs , proxies with r 2 > 0 . 9 were available in the respective studies ( Table 1 ) . Common SNPs at KCND3 ( PR ) , NR3C1 ( PR ) , and SGIP1 ( QT ) were present in HapMap . Both proxies and directly imputed SNPs were at least nominally signi ﬁ cant in pre - vious studies ( P - values ranging from 10 – 3 to 10 – 6 ) with typically high imputation quality . In addition to the “ winner ’ s curse ” effect , we expect that higher quality imputation due to the considerably larger haplotype panel ( compared to HapMap ) and the ancestry matching between GoNL and our Dutch cohorts will improve the power to detect a true association signal , if present . Although combining multiple reference panels for imputation is becoming the new standard [ 27 ] , limitations to our study remain : ( 1 ) the GoNL reference panel may not contain suf ﬁ cient information on rare SNPs ; ( 2 ) the small sample size of individual cohorts may cause abnormal behavior of rare SNPs as a group , requiring us to remove that subset of SNPs ; or ( 3 ) the sample size or power of the overall study is still limited to detect rare variant associations . Fine - mapping of known loci Although we did not sequence the loci containing the known and novel signals , we have a much denser inter - rogation of these regions compared to previous ( HapMap - based ) studies . In an attempt to ﬁ ne map the signi ﬁ cant loci , we annotated all signi ﬁ cant SNPs with their predicted functional consequences . First , we used SIFT and PolyPhen - 2 to predict the effect of 15 non - synonymous SNPs that were associated with one of the ECG traits at genome - wide signi ﬁ cance . PolyPhen - 2 classi ﬁ ed three SNPs as possibly damaging and SIFT pre - dicted only one SNP to be damaging . These were non - overlapping , raising questions as to the actual effect of these SNPs on their respective genes . Functional studies should be pursued to test the direct effect of these SNPs on protein structure . Combining all index SNPs , we tested the function of those SNPs located in cis - regulatory regions using GREAT [ 22 ] . We identi ﬁ ed 100 independent SNP - trait associations , which mapped to 103 genes . Interestingly , we ﬁ nd hundreds of signi ﬁ cant nodes , of which the vast majority is related to cardiac functioning and heart disease ( Supplementary Table 5a – e ) . This shows that , indeed , many SNPs are located in cis - regulatory regions of genes that are critical in the functioning of the human heart , which implicates a regulatory function of these loci rather than a structural function changing the protein directly . One example is shown in Supplementary Figure 3 ; this ﬁ gure contains all signi ﬁ cant GO molecular function nodes . Most of these nodes are in the group of transporter activity , which includes all transmembrane channels that are known to be important for cardiac function . Because the GREAT pathways show that many SNPs probably have their effect on the trait due to gene regula - tion , we extracted all signi ﬁ cant SNPs from RegulomeDB to check which variants would likely affect binding in regulatory regions . A majority of loci contained at least one SNP that was expected to affect transcription factor binding ( Supplementary Table 6 ) . The score that is provided by RegulomeDB indicates that a SNP is likely ( or less likely ) located in a binding site . Interestingly , there are strong differences between loci in terms of the number of SNPs that may have a regulatory effect , and percentage of loci per trait that have a high score . For instance , seven out of 15 QT interval loci contains SNPs with a score of 1 , while only a single PR interval locus contains a SNP with this score . The SCN5A / SCN10A locus is strongly associated with PR interval ( best SNP P = 4 . 9 × 10 – 107 ) and contains over 450 signi ﬁ cant SNPs . Nevertheless , only six SNPs have a score of 2 or 3 , and none of the signi ﬁ cant SNPs have a score of 1 . However , many binding sites are tissue speci ﬁ c , and , therefore , testing SNPs with high scores systematically for their role in cardiac tissue could lead to more knowledge about their biological function . Conclusions Using the Genome of the Netherlands as imputation refer - ence panel , we identi ﬁ ed seven novel loci for quantitative 958 J . van Setten et al . ECG traits . Higher SNP density and higher imputation quality enabled us to annotate known loci , facilitating future studies to understand the biological effects of causal var - iants at many loci . Ultimately , combining imputation reference panels and increasing sample size for GWAS meta - analyses will continue to increase power for genetic discovery and novel target identi ﬁ cation . With many sequencing efforts ongoing and large population - based cohorts being genotyped ( such as UK Biobank , of which the ﬁ rst release data showed 46 novel loci for RR interval [ 28 ] ) , we can expect hundreds of novel loci for ECG phe - notypes in the near future .
