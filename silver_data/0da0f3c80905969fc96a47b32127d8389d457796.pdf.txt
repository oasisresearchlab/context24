Gomory , Alfred P . Sloan Foundation , New York , NY , March 26 , 2007 ( received for review October 27 , 2006 ) The impossibility theorems that abound in the theory of social choice show that there can be no satisfactory method for electing and ranking in the context of the traditional , 700 - year - old model . A more realistic model , whose antecedents may be traced to Laplace and Galton , leads to a new theory that avoids all impos - sibilities with a simple and eminently practical method , ‘‘the majority judgement . ’’ It has already been tested . T he theory of social choice concerns methods for amalgamating the appreciations or evaluations of many individuals into one collective appreciation or evaluation . It has two principal applica - tions . ( i ) Voting : electors in a democracy choose one among several candidates , or committee members decide on one among several courses of action . ( ii ) Jury decisions : judges evaluate competitors ( e . g . , figure skaters , gymnasts , pianists , wines , etc . ) and rank them or classify them by level of excellence . b The fundamental problem is to find a social decision function ( SDF ) whose inputs are messages of judges or voters and whose outputs are the jury or electoral decisions , usually rank - orderings of competitors and winners . Much of the theory of social choice has blurred the distinction between a judge’s complex aims , ends , purposes and wishes , in short , his or her preferences or utilities , and the messages he or she is allowed to send . c In the traditional model , consecrated by some seven centuries of use , d each individual judge’s or voter’s rank ordering of the com - petitors is at once his or her message and his or her preferences . Does it mean that the judge prefers this rank ordering above all others ; or , that the judge wishes the first competitor on his list to be the winner , the second to be the winner if the first is not , the third to be the winner if the first two are not , and so on down the list ; or , is the rank ordering required and chosen strategically by the judge given his or her ‘‘true’’ rank ordering . In the real world , a judge’s message is simply a message , nothing more . It depends on the judge’s preferences , but it is not and cannot be his or her preferences . In the real world , a judge’s or a voter’s preferences or utilities depends on a host of factors that include the decision ( or output ) , the messages of the other judges ( a judge or voter may wish to differ from the others , or on the contrary resemble the others ) , the social decision function that is used ( a judge may prefer a decision given by ‘‘democratic’’ function to one rendered by an ‘‘oligarchique’’ function , or the contrary ) , and the message he or she thinks is the right one ( a judge may prefer honest behavior , or not ) . Kenneth Arrow ( 5 ) , in the first deep theoretical analysis of the theory of social choice , uses the traditional model : each judge’s input message is a rank ordering , routinely interpreted to be a complete expression of his ‘‘preferences’’ ( strategic considerations are absent ) ; the output is a rank ordering and a winner ( the first - ranked competitor of the order ) . His celebrated ‘‘impossibil - ity’’ theorem shows that there exists no social welfare function ( SWF ) satisfying three reasonable properties for obtaining a deci - sion given any inputs ( unless there are only two competitors ) . Amartya Sen ( 6 ) models each judge’s inputs as a numerical ‘‘utility’’ over the competitors , i . e . , the judge assigns a real number to every competitor ; the output is a rank ordering whose utility to a judge is not specified . The model has theoretical interest but no practical significance because a voter’s individual utility is a much more complex concept . In any case , Arrow’s theorem emerges again unless the utilities are assumed to be comparable ( that bugbear of economists ! ) . The model used to prove the well known Gibbard – Satterthwaite ( 7 , 8 ) impossibility theorem assumes the output is a winner ( indeed , how could preferences be modelled if the output were a rank - ordering ? ) ; each judge has ‘‘true’’ preferences ex - pressed as a rank ordering ; but a judge’s input is a strategically chosen rank ordering . The theorem states that there exists no social choice function that makes it a dominant strategy for every judge to report his true preferences . Refined , extended , and reformulated in many variants , the traditional approach has continued to produce a host of related impossibility theorems . We add to this list a negative theorem of a new kind : a fundamental incompatibility between winners and rank orderings as outputs of the traditional model . It devolves from a simple observation : if the output is to be a rank ordering and inputs are interpreted as preferences , should not an individual’s input message be his preferences over rank orderings rather than a single rank ordering ? Given all of these negative results , it is not surprising that the debate over what method of voting should be used in practice goes on unabated . By and large , it may be said to pit the supporters of Lull ( alias Condorcet ) against those of Cusanus ( alias Borda ) , though some argue for a new method , ‘‘approval voting’’ ( 9 ) , and diverse hybrids are regularly proposed . We contend that ( i ) Arrow’s and all the other impossibility and incompatibility results show that the fundamental problem has no acceptable solution in the context of the traditional model . ( ii ) The traditionalapproachdoesnotadequatelymodelthemessagesorthepurposesofthejudgesandvoters . ( iii ) A new model is necessary . Practice , curiously enough , suggests a different formulation of the inputs . Olympic competitions in figure skating and gymnastics , wine competitions , competitions among pianists , flautists , or or - chestras , etc . , all use measures or grades . As Lord Kelvin pro - claimed , ‘‘If you cannot measure , your knowledge is meager and unsatisfactory . ’’ Indeed , Arrow ( 5 ) himself states ‘‘there are essen - tially two methods by which social choices can be made , voting , . . . and the market mechanism’’ ; the second uses a measure : price expressed in terms of money . A measure or grade is a message that has strictly nothing to do with a utility . A judge may dislike a wine and yet give it a high grade because of its merits ; he or she may also like a wine and yet , with great satisfaction , give it a low grade because of its demerits . A measure provides a common language , be it numerical , ordinal or Authorcontributions : M . B . andR . L . designedresearch , performedresearch , andwrotethe paper .

In this respect , Arrow’s theorem means that , without a common language , there can be no consistent collective decision . When the messages are grades expressed in a common language , then one method of classifying competitors , candidates , or alter - natives , the majority - grade , and one method for ranking them , the majority - ranking , emerge as the only ones that satisfy each of various desirable properties . They are compatible . Moreover , they best resist strategic manipulations of judges and voters under varying assumptions concerning the judges’ and voters’ preferences or utilities . The Traditional Model There are a finite set of competitors ( alternatives , candidates , performances , orcompetinggoods ) C (cid:1) { A , . . . , I , . . . , Z } andafinite set of n judges ( or voters ) J (cid:1) { 1 , . . . , j , . . . , n } . Each judge’s input message is a rank ordering of the competitors . Together , all of the input messages constitute a preference profile ( in keeping with traditional terminology we use the word ‘‘preference ( s ) ’’ as a synonym for rank orderings in this section ) . A SWF renders an output—a rank ordering—for any inputs or preference profile . Take A (cid:1) B to mean that a judge ranks A ahead of B , and A (cid:1) S B to mean that the SWF ( or ‘‘Society’’ ) ranks A ahead of B ; in examples an integer followed by a rank ordering is the number of judges sending that input message . Condorcet is the first to have realized the essential difficulty of the problem . Consider one of his examples with the 60 - judge preference profile : 23 : A (cid:1) B (cid:1) C 2 : B (cid:1) A (cid:1) C 17 : B (cid:1) C (cid:1) A 10 : C (cid:1) A (cid:1) B 8 : C (cid:1) B (cid:1) A . If majority rule decides the order between each pair of competitors separately , the result is A (cid:1) S B (cid:1) S C (cid:1) S A . This is the Condorcet paradox : no competitor is favored to all others . Arrow showed that this is an inescapable conundrum . He im - posed three conditions that any SWF should satisfy . ( i ) Unanimity : If every judge prefers competitor A to competitor B , i . e . , A (cid:1) B , then the SWF ranks A ahead of B , i . e . , A (cid:1) S B . ( ii ) Non - dictatorship : The input of no one judge can determine the output of the SWF whatever the inputs of all the other judges . ( iii ) Independence of irrelevant alternatives ( IIA ) : whether the SWF yields A (cid:1) S B or the contrary A (cid:2) S B depends only on the judges’ preferences between A and B . His theorem shows that , when there are at least three competitors , there is no SWF that satisfies the three conditions for all possible inputs of the judges . Nevertheless , people vote and judges rank , but how ? A judge accords k Borda - points to a competitor if k opponents are ranked below him . e A competitor’s Borda - score is the sum of his Borda points over all judges ; equivalently , it is the sum of the votes he receives in all pair by pair votes ( 11 ) . The Borda - ranking ranks the competitors by their Borda - scores , from highest to lowest ; the highest designates the Borda - winner . The Borda - ranking for Con - dorcet’s 60 - judge example is ( each competitor’s Borda - score is in parentheses ) : B ( 69 ) (cid:1) S A ( 58 ) (cid:1) S C ( 53 ) . Condorcet attacked Borda’s method . His argument was that , when there exists a Condorcet - winner , a competitor who has a majority against every other competitor , then he must be the winner , a property that Borda’s method violates , as the following 81 - judge example of Condorcet shows : 30 : A (cid:1) B (cid:1) C 1 : A (cid:1) C (cid:1) B 29 : B (cid:1) A (cid:1) C 10 : B (cid:1) C (cid:1) A 10 : C (cid:1) A (cid:1) B 1 : C (cid:1) B (cid:1) A . Here the Borda - ranking is B ( 109 ) (cid:1) S A ( 101 ) (cid:1) S C ( 33 ) , yet A is the Condorcet - winner . Suppose a profile is split into two parts and a method is applied to each to obtain solutions S 1 and S 2 that have an element in common . The method is join - consistent if it selects a solution from S 1 (cid:1) S 2 for the entire profile . Young ( 12 ) introduced this idea to characterize Borda’s method ( and positional methods ) . Saari ( 13 ) reinvented it and applied it to Condorcet’s example . Let the first part of the profile be 20 : A (cid:1) B (cid:1) C 28 : B (cid:1) A (cid:1) C , and the second part be 10 : A (cid:1) B (cid:1) C 10 : B (cid:1) C (cid:1) A 10 : C (cid:1) A (cid:1) B . 1 : A (cid:1) C (cid:1) B 1 : C (cid:1) B (cid:1) A 1 : B (cid:1) A (cid:1) C . Each line of the second part is a Condorcet - component , a perfect symmetry among the candidates . B is the clear winner of the first ; symmetry shows that all the candidates are tied in the second part ; join - consistency implies B is the winner for the entire profile . This result indicates that the Condorcet - winner , when he exists , is certainly not the candidate who should win in every case ! Borda’s method ( and any ‘‘positional’’ method ) avoids this difficulty be - cause the total number of points awarded to every competitor in a Condorcet - component is the same . Saari ( 14 ) then asserted that ‘‘all election difficulties’’ come from Condorcet - components and , to a lesser extent , from more intricate symmetries in the preference profiles ; and concluded , ‘‘the [ Borda - count ] applied to all n - candidates is the unique ranking which avoids all of the indicated problems . ’’ f However , is Borda’s method good for ranking , or for designating winners , or both ? Condorcet ( 15 ) proposed a method explicitly for ranking ( as was recognized by Young , ref . 16 ) . A voter contributes k Condorcet - points to an arbitrary rank ordering A (cid:1) S B (cid:1) S C (cid:1) S . . . (cid:1) S Z if his input agrees in k pair - by - pair comparisons . The Condorcet - count of the rank ordering is the sum of the Condorcet - points over all voters . The Condorcet - ranking is the ranking that maximizes the Condorcet - count . It ranks the Condorcet winner first , and the Condorcet - loser , a competitor who loses against every other com - petitor , last , when either exist . Is it good for ranking , or for designating winners and losers , or both ? Thetwooutputs , arank - orderingandawinner , haveusuallybeen treated as two sides of one coin : given a rank - ordering , the winner is the first - placed competitor ; given a mechanism for determining a winner , place him first then apply the mechanism to the remaining competitors and place that winner second , and continue . These are questionable practices . To see why , consider the preference profile 333 : A (cid:1) B (cid:1) C 333 : B (cid:1) C (cid:1) A 333 : C (cid:1) A (cid:1) B . The 999 judges constitute a Condorcet - component , and so cancel each other out . Borda and Condorcet agree on the winners : A , B , and C are tied . Condorcet ( reasonably ) says the three stated rank - orderings are tied for first ; Borda ( ridiculously ) , says that all six possible rank orderings are tied for first . Now , consider the same situation with one additional judge A (cid:1) C (cid:1) B . Borda ( reasonably ) declares A the winner and B the loser , but ( ridiculously ) the ranking A (cid:1) S C (cid:1) S B , because only one judge agrees with it , 666 partially agree , and 333 totally disagree . Condorcet ( reasonably ) declares the rankings A (cid:1) S B (cid:1) S C and C (cid:1) S A (cid:1) S B are tied : 333 agree and 667 partially agree . However , A and C should certainly not be tied as winners . e Laplace ( 10 ) justiﬁed the Borda - points by imagining that each judge wishes to assign a positive real score in some interval [ 0 , R ] to each competitor but is asked instead to rank them . Laplacecomputedtheaverageofthelowestpoints , ofthenexttolowest , onupto the highest , and found them to be proportional to the Borda points . f Saari ( 13 ) proposes ‘‘Instant - Borda - Runoff’’ to counter manipulation : namely , obtain the Bordaranking , dropthebottomcandidate , andrepeatuntilonecandidateremains . This method always elects the Condorcet winner when he exists . Balinski and Laraki PNAS (cid:1) May 22 , 2007 (cid:1) vol . 104 (cid:1) no . 21 (cid:1) 8721 A PP L I E D M A T H E M A T I C S E C O N O M I C S C I E N C E S Borda’s method is appropriate for designating winners and losers , Condorcet’s method is appropriate for designating rank orderings , a fact already appreciated by Young ( 17 ) . In fact , the situation is much worse : the two outputs cannot be reconciled . A SWF is winner – loser - unanimous if , whenever all voters rank a candidate first ( respectively , last ) , he is the winner ( the loser ) . It is choice - compatible if whenever all voters rank a candidate first ( respectively , last ) and a Condorcet - component is added to the profile , that candidate is the winner ( the loser ) . It is rank - compatible if , wheneverawinnerisremovedfromthesetofcandidates , thenew ranking on the remaining candidates agrees with original ranking . Borda’s method is choice - compatible but not rank - compatible ; Condorcet’s is rank - compatible but not choice - compatible . Theorem 1 ( Incompatibility ) . There exists no winner – loser - unanimous , choice - and rank - compatible method . Grading : The Basic Model A thorough investigation of practice shows that scores , measures , or grades have been invented to classify and to rank in an incredibly wide variety of circumstances . Practical people needing practical solutions have increasingly devised mechanisms to transform judges’ grades ( instead of rank orderings ) into a jury’s grades to determine final rank orderings . A set of grades ( e . g . , numbers from 0 to 20 , to 25 , or to 100 ; medal nominations from none to bronze , silver or gold ; letters from F to A ; or words or phrases from bad to excellent ) becomes , in effect , a common language used to assess performances , just as grades determine the standing of students in schools and universities . Formally , a common language (cid:2) is a set of grades (cid:1) , (cid:2) , etc . , that are strictly ordered . It may be finite or an interval of the real numbers . (cid:1) (cid:3) (cid:2) means that either (cid:1) is a higher grade than (cid:2) , in symbols , (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:2) , or (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:2) . There are a finite set of m competitors C (cid:1) { A , . . . , I , . . . , Z } and a finite set of n judges ( or voters ) J (cid:1) { 1 , . . . , j , . . . , n } . A problem is completely specified by an input or profile (cid:3) (cid:1) (cid:3) ( C , J ) : an m by n matrix of the grades (cid:3) ( I , j ) (cid:2) (cid:2) assigned by each of the judges j (cid:2) J to each of the competitors I (cid:2) C . A method of grading is a function F that assigns to any input or profile (cid:3) one output or final grade in the same language for every competitor F : (cid:2) m (cid:4) n 3 (cid:2) m . Designed to assign grades , it must satisfy certain basic properties . Axiom 1 . F is neutral : F ( (cid:3) (cid:3) ) (cid:1) (cid:3) F ( (cid:3) ) , for any permutation (cid:3) of the competitors ( or rows ) . Axiom 2 . F is anonymous : F ( (cid:3) (cid:4) ) (cid:1) F ( (cid:3) ) , for any permutation (cid:4) of the judges ( or columns ) . Axiom 3 . F is unanimous : If a competitor is given an identical grade (cid:1) by every judge , then F assigns him the grade (cid:1) . Axiom 4 . F is monotonic : If (cid:3) (cid:1) (cid:3)(cid:5) except that one or more judges give higher grades to competitor I in (cid:3) than in (cid:3)(cid:5) , then F ( (cid:3) ) ( I ) (cid:3) F ( (cid:3)(cid:5) ) ( I ) . Moreover , if all the judges give higher grades to competitor I in (cid:3) than in (cid:3)(cid:5) , then F ( (cid:3) ) ( I ) (cid:1) F ( (cid:3)(cid:5) ) ( I ) . Axiom 5 . F is independent of irrelevant alternatives ( IIA ) : if the grades assigned by the judges to a competitor I (cid:2) C in two profiles (cid:3) and (cid:3)(cid:5) are the same , then F ( (cid:3) ) ( I ) (cid:1) F ( (cid:3)(cid:5) ) ( I ) . A function f : (cid:2) n 3 (cid:2) that transforms a set of judge’s grades into a single grade will be called an aggregation function if it satisfies the following three properties : Y anonymity : f ( . . . , (cid:1) , . . . , (cid:2) , . . . ) (cid:1) f ( . . . , (cid:2) , . . . , (cid:1) , . . . ) ; Y unanimity : f ( (cid:1) , (cid:1) , . . . , (cid:1) ) (cid:1) (cid:1) ; and Y monotonicity : (cid:1) j (cid:4) (cid:2) j f f (cid:6) (cid:1) 1 , . . . , (cid:1) j , . . . , (cid:1) n (cid:7) (cid:4) f (cid:6) (cid:1) 1 , . . . , (cid:2) j , . . . , (cid:1) n (cid:7) and (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) (cid:2) 1 , . . . , (cid:1) n (cid:2) (cid:2) n f f (cid:6) (cid:1) 1 , . . . , (cid:1) n (cid:7) (cid:2) f (cid:6) (cid:2) 1 , . . . , (cid:2) n (cid:7) . Theorem 2 ( Possibility ) . A method of grading F satisfies the five axioms if and only if F ( (cid:3) ) ( I ) (cid:1) f ( (cid:3) ( I ) ) for every I (cid:2) C , for some one aggregation function f . The average or mean value function is the universally used aggregation function in practice , though sometimes highest and lowest grades are dropped . This means that the output language is almost always richer than the language of the input grades ( inputs are usually restricted to discrete levels ) . In conformity with most practical applications , the common language is parametrized as a subset of real numbers and whatever aggregation is used , small changes in the parametrization or the input grades should imply small changes in the output or the final grades . Hence , even if the initial language is finite , all possible parametrizations must be considered . It is thus natural to take the common language to be [ 0 , R ] for some positive real R ( as did Laplace ) , and impose : Axiom 6 . F ( and its aggregation function f ) is continuous . A social grading function ( SGF ) F is a method of grading that satisfies the six axioms of the basic model . Thus , F defines , and is defined by , a unique continuous aggre - gation function f . In the sequel , because a SGF and its aggre - gation function go hand in hand , properties are defined in terms of aggregation functions , theorems stated in terms of SGFs . Also , r (cid:1) ( r 1 , . . . , r n ) represents a competitor’s grades , super - scripts designate competitors . Enriching a language by embedding it into a real interval opens the door to many more methods of grading , but it will turn out that the aggregation functions that emerge as those that must be used are directly applicable in the seemingly more restrictive finite languages as well . Order Functions A judge of the jury knows the SGF ( equivalently , the aggregation function f ) that determines the final grades : what strategies will he use in the ‘‘game’’ of assigning his grades ? A judge undoubtedly wishes to give the grade he believes is the ‘‘right one ; ’’ he may , however , assign it so that the final grade is as close as possible to the ‘‘right one ; ’’ or , he may try to manipulate the outcome for extra - neous reasons ( as did a judge of the pairs figure skating in the 2002 Olympic games ) . This is why , in practice , highest ( one or two ) and lowest ( one or two ) grades are often eliminated . The ‘‘utility’’ of a judge j is a complicated function u j ( r * , r , f , (cid:2) ) , where r * (cid:1) ( r 1 * , . . . , r n * ) are the grades the judges believe are the right ones and r (cid:1) ( r 1 , . . . , r n ) , the grades they give . The util - ity of judge j might include a term (cid:8) (cid:1) r j * (cid:8) r j (cid:1) if he wished to grade honestly ; it might contain a term (cid:5) (cid:3) i (cid:9) j (cid:1) r i * (cid:8) r i (cid:1) if he wished that the other judges graded honestly ; it might include a term (cid:8) (cid:1) (cid:2) (cid:8) (cid:2) j * (cid:1) if he wished a language (cid:2) j * were used ; and it is often assumed to be ‘‘single - peaked , ’’ u j ( r * , r , f , (cid:2) ) (cid:1) (cid:8) (cid:1) r * j (cid:8) f ( r 1 , . . . , r n ) (cid:1) . In fact , judges’ utilities , judges’ beliefs , their beliefs about the others’ beliefs , etc . , are all completely unknown and change from one competition to another . The methods we develop depend only on what in practice can be known , as does Vickrey’s second price auction mechanism . So ( unlike ‘‘mechanism design’’ ) judges’ util - ities are never explicitly assumed . The methods that are singled out are nevertheless ‘‘strategy - proof’’ for large classes of reasonable ‘‘utilities ; ’’ when they are not , they best combat manipulability . Suppose that r is a competitor’s final grade . An aggregation function is strategy - proof - in - grading if , when a judge’s input grade is r (cid:10) (cid:11) r , any change in his input can only lead to a lower grade ; and 8722 (cid:1) www . pnas . org (cid:2) cgi (cid:2) doi (cid:2) 10 . 1073 (cid:2) pnas . 0702634104 Balinski and Laraki if , when a judge’s input grade is r (cid:8) (cid:12) r , any change in his input , can only lead to a higher grade . Strategy - proof - in - grading implies that it is a dominant strategy for a judge to honestly assign the grade he believes is the correct one , whenever the more a final grade deviates from the correct one the less he likes it ( ‘‘single - peaked preference , ’’ a reasonable assump - tion for most judges who grade ) . There is a class of SGFs that is easily seen to be strategy - proof : the order functions . The k th highest grade is called the k th - order function f k . Theorem 3 . The unique strategy - proof - in - grading SGFs are the order functions . They are ‘‘group strategy - proof - in - grading’’ as well . [ Moulin ( 18 ) proves a related technical result but in an entirely different context . ] The result holds without the continuity assumption and also when the language is finite . How can the effects of strategic manipulation be countered when judges’ appreciations or utilities are more complex ? To manipulate , a judge must be able to raise or to lower the final grade by raising orloweringthegradeheassigns . Insomesituations , ajudgecanonly change the final grade by increasing his grade , in others only by decreasing his grade . A judge who can both lower and raise the final grade has greater opportunity to manipulate . Theorem 4 . There exists no SGF that , for every profile of grades , prevents every judge from both increasing and decreasing the final grade . TheuniqueSGFsforwhichatmostonejudgemaybothincrease and decrease a final grade are the order functions . Given an aggregation function f and input grades r (cid:1) ( r 1 , . . . , r n ) , let (cid:6) (cid:8) ( f , r ) be number of judges who can decrease the final grade , (cid:6) (cid:10) ( f , r ) be the number of judges who can increase the final grade , and (cid:6) ( f , r ) (cid:1) (cid:6) (cid:8) ( f , r ) (cid:10) (cid:6) (cid:10) ( f , r ) . Define the manipulability of f , to be (cid:6) (cid:6) f (cid:7) (cid:7) max r (cid:1) (cid:6) r 1 , . . . , r n (cid:7) (cid:6) (cid:6) f , r (cid:7) . At worst , a judge can both increase and decrease the final grade , so (cid:6) ( f ) (cid:8) 2 n . In particular , when f is taken to be the arithmetic mean of the grades ( as does Borda’s method ) the manipulability is maximized , (cid:6) ( f ) (cid:1) 2 n . On the other hand , when f is the k th - order function , (cid:6) ( f ) (cid:1) n (cid:10) 1 . Theorem 5 . The unique SGFs that minimize manipulability are the order functions . Suppose that , after the members of a jury have assigned their grades , some judge wishes to revise his grade by assigning a grade closer to the final grade of the jury : more consensus for that final grade should confirm it . An aggregation function f is reinforcing when f ( r 1 , . . . , r k , . . . , r n ) (cid:1) r and r k (cid:11) rˆ k (cid:9) r or r (cid:9) rˆ k (cid:11) r k implies f ( r 1 , . . . , rˆ k , . . . , r n ) (cid:1) r . Theorem 6 . The unique reinforcing SGFs are the order functions . If every judge assigns a grade in a subset of the grades , then the final grade should belong to that subset . This may be seen as restricting outputs to the language of inputs , or generalizing una - nimity . Anaggregationfunction fconforms withtheassignedgrades if { r 1 , . . . , r n } (cid:3) S implies f ( r 1 , . . . , r n ) (cid:2) S . Theorem 7 . The unique SGFs that conform with the assigned grades are the order functions . The particular language used in grading should make no differ - ence in the ultimate outcomes . An aggregation function should give equivalent grades when one language is faithfully translated into another . This is the ‘‘meaningfulness’’ problem of measurement theory ( 19 ) in the context of a jury decision . An aggregation function f is language - consistent if f ( (cid:10) ( r 1 ) , . . . , (cid:10) ( r n ) ) (cid:1) (cid:10) ( f ( r 1 , . . . , r n ) ) for all increasing , continuous functions (cid:10) : [ 0 , R ] 3 [ (cid:5) R , R (cid:5) ] , (cid:10) ( 0 ) (cid:1) (cid:5) R , (cid:10) ( R ) (cid:1) R (cid:5) . Theorem 8 . The unique language - consistent SGFs are the order functions . This result depends crucially on the judges using a common language . When there is no common language , a judge’s only meaningful input is the order of his grades . An aggregation function f is preference - consistent if f ( r 1 , . . . , r n ) (cid:9) f ( s 1 , . . . , s n ) implies f ( (cid:10) 1 ( r 1 ) , . . . , (cid:10) n ( r n ) ) (cid:9) f ( (cid:10) 1 ( s 1 ) , . . . , (cid:10) ( s n ) ) , for all increasing , continuous functions (cid:10) j : [ 0 , R ] 3 [ (cid:5) R , R (cid:5) ] , (cid:10) j ( 0 ) (cid:1) (cid:5) R , (cid:10) j ( R ) (cid:1) R (cid:5) . Theorem 9 . ( Arrow’s Impossibility ) . There exists no preference - consistent SGF . This theorem shows that , to arrive at meaningful final grades , it is essential for judges to share a common language : otherwise , the road is barred by Arrow’s fundamental result . However , that only stands to reason : imagine the leaders of the world’s powers negotiating an agreement with no common language ( and no translators ) ! g The Majority - Grade The evidence supports the use of order functions when juries grade . There are many such functions . Different arguments single out one . Sir Francis Galton ( 23 ) had the key idea just one century ago , namely : ‘‘ [ The ] middlemost estimate , the number of votes that it is too high being exactly balanced by the number of votes that it is too low . Every other estimate is condemned by a majority of voters as being either too high or too low . . . The number of voters may be odd or even . If odd , there is one middlemost value . . . If the number of voters be even , there are two middlemost values , the mean of which must be taken . . . ’’ He erred in the even case . A middlemost aggregation function f , for r 1 (cid:9) . . . (cid:9) r n , is f (cid:6) r 1 , . . . , r n (cid:7) (cid:7) r (cid:6) n (cid:10) 1 (cid:7) / 2 when n is odd , and r n / 2 (cid:9) f (cid:6) r 1 , . . . , r n (cid:7) (cid:9) r (cid:6) n (cid:10) 2 (cid:7) / 2 when n is even . When n isodd , itistheorderfunction f ( n (cid:10) 1 ) / 2 . When n iseven , there are infinitely many ; in particular , f n / 2 and f ( n (cid:10) 2 ) / 2 are the upper - middlemost and lower - middlemost order functions . The middlem - ost interval is the r ( n (cid:10) 1 ) / 2 when n is odd , and [ r ( n (cid:10) 2 ) / 2 , r n / 2 ] when n is even . Whatever the parity of n , every grade other than a grade in the middlemost interval is condemned by an absolute majority of the judges as being either too high or too low . Theorem 10 . The unique aggregation functions that assign a final grade of r when a majority of judges assign r are the middlemost . Practical mechanisms of grading often eliminate extremes to counter cheaters , to guard against cranks , and to emphasize the significance of place in order rather than magnitude . A SGF counters crankiness h if for r 1 (cid:9) . . . (cid:9) r n , n (cid:9) 3 , its aggregation function f satisfies f ( r 1 , r 2 , . . . , r n (cid:8) 1 , r n ) (cid:1) f ( r 2 , . . . , r n (cid:8) 1 ) , where in going from left to right the highest and lowest grades have been dropped ( the two f s are , in fact , different , but expressing the idea in this manner simplifies notation ) . Iterating , f ( r 1 , r 2 , . . . , r n (cid:8) 1 , r n ) (cid:1) f ( r (cid:10) , r (cid:8) ) where [ r (cid:8) , r (cid:10) ] is the middlemost interval ( a point r (cid:8) (cid:1) r (cid:10) when n is odd ) . When a judge dislikes a final grade the further it departs from his ideal grade , it is a dominant strategy for him to assign his ideal g Properties close to language - and preference - consistency are known under different namesintheliteratureonmeasurementtheory ; inparticular , Theorems8and9areknown inoneguiseoranother ( 20 – 21 ) . Workonwelfarism ( 22 ) initiatedbySen ( 6 ) hasconsidered similar invariance properties . h ThewordhonorsGalton ( 23 ) , whowishedtoavoidgiving‘‘powerto‘cranks’inproportion to their crankiness . ’’ Balinski and Laraki PNAS (cid:1) May 22 , 2007 (cid:1) vol . 104 (cid:1) no . 21 (cid:1) 8723 A PP L I E D M A T H E M A T I C S E C O N O M I C S C I E N C E S grade . But judges may have different incentives . A judge may wish to either increase or decrease the final grade . The k th - order function allows n (cid:8) k (cid:10) 1 judges to increase the final grade and k to decrease it . It is desirable to thwart potential manipulation as much as possible . Letting (cid:11) be the probability a judge wishes to increase the grade and 1 (cid:8) (cid:11) that he wishes to decrease it , the probability of effective - manipulability of the aggregation function f is EM (cid:6) f (cid:7) (cid:7) max r (cid:1) (cid:6) r 1 , . . . , r n (cid:7) max 0 (cid:8)(cid:11)(cid:8) 1 (cid:11)(cid:6) (cid:10) (cid:6) f , r (cid:7) (cid:12) (cid:6) 1 (cid:5) (cid:11) (cid:7) (cid:6) (cid:8) (cid:6) f , r (cid:7) n . Theorem 11 . The unique aggregation functions that minimize the probability of effective - manipulability or that counter crankiness are the middlemost that depend only on the middlemost interval . Many physical measures have the property that equal intervals have the same significance : they are ‘‘interval measures’’ in the jargon of measurement theory . The grades invented to assign to competing skaters , pianists or politicians could be interval mea - sures , but more likely are not . As a grade approaches ‘‘perfection , ’’ each additional point often represents much more than an addi - tional point added to a middling grade ; and at the other end of the scale , the same phenomenon exists . It is reasonable to suppose that an interval measure exists in theory . In fact , points are routinely added and averaged , so treated as if they were interval measures . This is why some parametrizations attempt to linearize the lan - guage . It suffices to postulate the existence of much less to imply the existence of an interval measure . For example , suppose there exists a distance function d that measures the judge’s discontent : when the judge assigns the grade r and the final grade is s , his disutility is d ( r , s ) (cid:9) 0 . Thus , d satisfies : d ( r , r ) (cid:1) 0 , d ( r , s ) (cid:1) d ( s , r ) , and r (cid:12) s (cid:12) t implies d ( r , s ) (cid:10) d ( s , t ) (cid:1) d ( r , t ) . The last equation says that the improvement in a compet - itor’s performance in going from a grade of r to s plus the improvement in going from s to t equals that of going from r to t ; or , that the disutility of a judge who believes the grade should be r when the final grade is t equals his disutility when the final grade is s plus his disutility when he believes it should be s when the final grade is t . This accommodates the possibility that , for example , on a scale of 0 to 100 , d ( 98 , 99 ) (cid:1) 5 d ( 75 , 76 ) . Several arguments suggest that it is reasonable to assume that all the judges view changes in performances similarly : one judge teaches all others ; or , the rules impose by fiat that they do ; or , equity among the judges demands that their disutilities must be modelled identically . A SGF with aggregation function f maximizes welfare when the final grade f ( r 1 , . . . , r n ) (cid:1) r minimizes the total disutility of all of the judges , (cid:13) ( r ) (cid:1) (cid:3) j (cid:13) (cid:1) d ( r , r j ) . Theorem 12 . The unique aggregation functions that maximize welfare are the middlemost . Thus imposing an equity condition , namely , that judges compare performanceswiththesamemeasure , togetherwiththeassumption that the measure is a distance function , implies that the optimal mechanism must be a majority decision . A distance function is equivalent to the existence of an interval measure ( not necessarily compact ) . i Characterization : ASGF rewardsconsensus whenallof A ’sgrades strictly belong to the middlemost interval of B ’s grades implies that A ’s final grade is higher than B ’s final grade . The majority - grade f maj is the SGF defined by the order function f ( n (cid:10) 1 ) / 2 when n is odd , and by the lower - middlemost order function f ( n (cid:10) 2 ) / 2 when n is even . Theorem 13 . The unique middlemost aggregation function that rewards consensus is the majority - grade f maj . The Majority - Ranking A competitor bestowed a higher grade than another is naturally ranked higher in the order of the competitors than the other : grades imply orders . The essential incompatibility between the designation of winners ( or losers ) and rank orderings inherent to the traditional model ( Theorem 1 ) simply does not arise in the context of grades . On the other hand , although in some applications a complete ordering is not sought , e . g . , wine competitions , there are other applications , notably sports and elections , where an ordered list from first to last and a clear winner is absolutely necessary . When rank orderings are the principal goal instead of grades , the strategic behavior of the judges may change . A SGF is strategy - proof - in - ranking if for any judge j final grades r A (cid:12) r B opposed to the judge’s grades r jA (cid:11) r jB implies he can neither decrease B ’s final grade nor increase A ’s final grade ; and it is partially strategy - proof - in - ranking if any judge in the same situation can decrease B ’s final grade implies he cannot increase A ’s and if he can increase A ’s final grade implies he cannot decrease B ’s . Theorem 14 . There exists no SGF that is strategy - proof - in - ranking . The unique SGFs that are partially strategy - proof - in - ranking are the order functions . When the majority - grades of two competitors A and B differ , the one with the higher majority - grade ranks ahead of the other . When the majority - grades of two competitors are equal , no more useful information concerning these two competitors can be drawn from this grade . The majority - ranking ( (cid:1) maj ) between two competitors is deter - mined by : ( 1 ) If f maj ( A ) (cid:11) f maj ( B ) then A (cid:1) maj B . ( 2 ) If f maj ( A ) (cid:1) f maj ( B ) , the majority - grade is dropped from the grades of each of the competitors , and the procedure is repeated . Theorem 15 . The majority - ranking always ranks one competitor ahead of another unless the two are assigned an identical set of grades by the judges . The first - majority - grade of a competitor is the majority grade of the entire jury ; the second - majority - grade is the majority grade of the grades that remain after the first - majority grade has been dropped ; the i th majority grade is the majority grade of the grades that remain after the first i (cid:8) 1 majority grades have been dropped . A competitor’s majority - value is a vector of n components that assigns , in order , his first , second , third , . . . , n th - majority - grades . Theorem 16 . A (cid:1) maj B if and only if A’s majority - value is lexicograph - ically higher than B’s . The majority - value assigns a specific value to each competitor expressed in terms of the common language . It may be transformed into a rational number when the language is finite . For example , if the language has ten grades 0 , 3 , 5 , 6 , . . . , 11 , 13 ( Denmark’s school grades ; the absence of certain numbers is an attempt to linearize ) and a competitor receives the grades ( 7 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 ) , then his majority - value is 9 , 07100711 . Dividing by 1 . 01010101 rescales the final values so that the minimum is 0 , the maximum 13 , and a candidate assigned the same grade (cid:1) by all judges has a rescaled majority value of (cid:1) . Characterization : Given input grades r A (cid:1) ( r 1 A , . . . , r nA ) , r B (cid:1) ( r 1 B , . . . , r nB ) of two competitors , how should they be ranked ? Write A (cid:1) S B to mean A is ranked ahead of B , and A (cid:3) S B to mean either A is ahead of B or they are tied . If n (cid:9) 3 , the highest and the lowest grades are r ’s residual grades , its set of center grades is obtained by dropping the residual grades . A social ranking function ( SRF ) should satisfy several properties . It should be ( i ) monotone : if A (cid:3) S B and one judge raises the grade he gives to A then A (cid:1) S B . It should be ( ii ) decisive for the center grades : the ranking between A and B is the ranking determined by i Deﬁning (cid:10) ( s ) (cid:1) d ( R / 2 , s ) if s (cid:9) R / 2 and (cid:1) (cid:8) d ( R / 2 , s ) if s (cid:8) R / 2 implies d ( r , s ) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:10) ( r ) (cid:8) (cid:10) ( s ) (cid:1) . 8724 (cid:1) www . pnas . org (cid:2) cgi (cid:2) doi (cid:2) 10 . 1073 (cid:2) pnas . 0702634104 Balinski and Laraki the center grades unless that ranking is a tie ; in that case , the ranking is determined by the residual grades . Finally , it should ( iii ) reward consensus . Theorem 17 . The majority - ranking is the unique monotone SRF that is decisive for the center and rewards consensus . j The majority - ranking is IIA in the sense of Arrow : the order between two competitors depends only on their respective grades . Remark . This theory is not ‘‘cardinal’’ : adding grades is mean - ingless . Nor is it ‘‘ordinal’’ : a voter’s message depends on the particular words of the language that is used , so different common languages with the same number of words may lead to different rankings . And yet , a grade in a common language has an absolute meaning . Practice Jury Decisions . The majority grade and ranking are described in the new edition of the French ‘‘Bible’’ on wines ( 24 ) . They were tested in a wine competition , Les citadelles du vin , held June 15 – 17 , 2006 , in the Bordeaux region of France . A total of 1 , 247 different wines competed , 60 judges were organized in juries of five members ( sometimes fewer ) . As usual , judges completed the ‘‘Sensorial analysis tasting sheet for wine judging competitions’’ of the Organi - sationInternationaledelaVigneetduVin foreachwine : 14attributes of the wine were assigned points ( from 0 ‘‘bad’’ to 6 or 8 ‘‘excel - lent’’ ) ; their sum determined whether the wine was bestowed a gold , silver , bronze , or no medal at all . However , the sum misses the point ( 25 ) because it ‘‘has difficulty in detecting exceptional wines by overly favoring those that are ‘taste - wise correct . ’ ” Moreover , there is strong evidence showing that judges work ‘‘backwards , ’’ they first decidethegradetheywishtobestow , thenassignpointstoattributes whose sum yield the grade . The judges preferred to answer ‘‘For you , this wine is : ’’ with one of five descriptions that constituted the common language in this experiment : Excellent , Very good , Good , Average , or Mediocre . A preliminary evaluation of the experiment concludes : ‘‘The ‘majority - grade’ correctly distinguished . . . the wines , in accordance with the traditional objectives of wine com - petitions . Thissystemseemsbetteradaptedthanthe [ oldsystem ] . . . [ However ] , the scale of five levels—97 % of the grades were confined to three levels—should be extended” ( J . Blouin , personal communication ) . Voting . The majority ranking’s first - ranked candidate designates the winner of an election . Approval voting ( AV ) uses a common language of two words , 1 ‘‘approve’’ and 0 ‘‘disapprove . ’’ The majority - ranking with a 0 , 1 - language is the approval voting ranking , so AV is a special case of the majority - ranking . AV has been tested in a variety of settings , notably professional scientific societies . It was also tested ( 26 ) in parallel with the first round of the French presidential election of 2002 , when 16 candidates presented them - selves : voters were clearly happy to be able to express themselves better with AV than casting at most one solitary vote . The argu - ments for and against AV have been cast in the context of the traditional model and have not addressed the real problem . The only solid results assume ‘‘dichotomous preferences’’ ( 27 , 28 ) but ‘‘like’’ and ‘‘dislike’’ ( or the very different ‘‘for’’ and ‘‘against’’ ) is much too limited a language . Why do electors vote at all , when they hardly expect to determine the outcome ( 1 ) ? They feel the moral imperative to express themselves : whyelsedosomanycastblankvotes ? Aricherlanguage should encourage greater public participation . Exactly what com - mon language should be used in , say , a presidential election , is not a trivial choice . Perhaps it should be the grading system used in the nation’s educational system : from a low of F to a high of A in the U . S . , from 0 to 20 in France , or 0 to 13 in Denmark . Alternatively , an election of an official might ask each voter : ‘‘For you , this candidate is Exceptional , Accomplished , Capable , Average , Lim - ited , or Incompetent to undertake the high responsibilities of [ the office ] . ’’ The method was tested in the 2007 French presidential elections ( www . ceco . polytechnique . fr / jugement - majoritaire . html ) . Common Language . How to define a common language in general remains an open question , though in many applications ( e . g . , skating , diving , gymnastics , piano competitions ) languages already exist . Different applications naturally call for different common languages . Experimentation will be necessary to define a language ; and , as is true of any language , it will alter over time . The Les citadelles du vin experiment suggests that judges ( and voters ? ) shun the highest and lowest grades . It may be best to define a language with an even number of words in order to prevent voting in the middle , or not . The nature of the words or numbers used will illicit different voting and judging behavior : the words themselves matter ! The environment in which judging and voting take place may also . Just imagine , how would responsible voters behave were they to read Ramon Lull’s ( 3 ) solemn proclamation of 1299 before casting their ballots : . . . [ It ] is necessary to ascertain that in the election three things should be considered , of which the first is honesty and holiness of life , the second is knowledge and wis - dom , and the third is a suitable disposition of the heart . Each person having a vote in the chapter should take an oath by the holy gospels of God to consider these three things and to always elect the person in whom they are best [ embodied ] . 1 .
