INTRODUCTION Boundary objects ( BO ) ( Star 2010 ; Star & Griesemer 1989 ) are abstract or physical artefacts that reside in the interfaces between organisations or groups of people . They have the capacity to bridge perceptual and practical differences among communities and facil - itate cooperation by emerging mutual understanding ( Karsten et al . 2001 ) . They negotiate meaning between groups of people and pro - vide means to explain how and where communities , cultures and This is the space reserved for copyright notices . ASIS & T2014 , October31 - November5 , 2014 , Seattle , WA , USA Copyright notice continues right here . . . . information infrastructures are connected and disconnected . The theory of boundary objects was originally introduced by Star and Griesemer ( 1989 ) in their study on information practices at the Berkeley Museum of Vertebrate Zoology . They described boundary objects as translation devices and argued that shaping and mainte - nance of boundary objects is central to developing and maintaining coherence across communities . In a later text , Star ( 2010 ) empha - sized usefulness ( at particular levels of scale ) as a central premise of BOs and extended the contextualization of the BOs in the cy - cle of standardization ( making and collapse of standardised objects and systems ) , emergence of residual categories ( categories includ - ing not elsewhere categorized or none of the above , ) and the con - sequent surfacing of intermediary objects to facilitate cooperation . Studies have shown that different artefacts may function as BOs , in - cluding visual representations ( Henderson 1991 ) , cancer ( as a con - ceptual artefact ) ( Fujimura 1992 ) , technical standards , geographic information systems ( GIS ) ( Harvey & Chrisman 1998 ) , activities ( Macpherson et al . 2006 ) , group afﬁliations ( Lindberg & Czarni - awska 2006 ) and documents ( Østerlund 2008 ) . The concept of BO has been used in a broad variety of studies in different research communities from information systems and computer supported co - operative work research ( Lee 2007 ; Lutters & Ackerman 2007 ) to management ( Kuhn 2002 ) , archival science ( Yeo 2008 ) and library and information studies ( Albrechtsen & Ja - cob 1998 ; Lund 2009 ) . The original article from 1989 has been cited in Google Scholar almost 4500 times in January 2014 and 1388 times in Web of Science ( with 167 in 2012 compared to 53 in 2005 ) telling something about the inﬂuence of the theory . In addi - tion , a large corpus of literature discusses boundaries and boundary crossings using related concepts such as boundary spanning ( e . g . Carlile 2002 ; Gasson 2006 ; Levina & Vaast 2005 ) , boundary - work ( e . g . Faraj & Yan 2009 ) and boundary negotiating artifacts ( Lee 2007 ) . In information science research , BOs have been discussed in the context of document studies ( e . g . Huvila 2011 , 2012 ; Lund 2009 ) , information practices and work research ( e . g . Huvila 2013 ; McKenzie & Davies 2010 ) , knowledge organisation ( Albrechtsen & Jacob 1998 ; Jansen 2013 ) , community information ( e . g . West - brook & Finn 2012 ) and social informatics ( e . g . Fleischmann 2006 ; Worrall 2013b ) . The aim of this panel , representing scholars from different ar - eas of information science who have conducted empirical and the - oretical research guided by the theory of BOs , is 1 ) to provide an overview of and introduction to the state of the art of information science research informed by the theory for the researchers and practitioners participating the conference ; 2 ) to illustrate the vari - ety of studies and contexts in which the notion of BOs can be found useful in explicating connections between collections , cultures and communities ; and 3 ) to push forward the state of the art of BO - oriented information science research by discussing new empirical and practical areas of interest and the theory itself . 2 . LAYOUT OF THE PANEL The panel starts with a short presentation that introduces the con - cept of boundary objects and its origins to the audience . After the presentation , all panelists give a lightning talk of a case study of using BOs in different areas of information science research with a speciﬁc focus on the theoretical and practical beneﬁts of the ap - proach in the context of the speciﬁc study . After the lightning talks , the panelists are asked to give short , one minute reﬂections of how and in which area of research or practice they would push the state - of - the - art of BOs in the ﬁeld of information science . During the ﬁnal part of the panel , the audience is asked to join the discus - sion with panelists on BOs , their use and usefulness in information science and technology research . The discussion is led by the mod - erator and facilitated by a set of questions based on the panelists’ presentations . The presentations follow a double trajectory of exploring the use and usefulness of the notion of BOs in different areas of LIS research ( including Hourihan Jansen in knowledge organisation ; Worrall in social informatics and digital libraries ; Huvila , West - brook and McKenzie in the different context of information prac - tices , activities and behaviour ; and Anderson in the interface of IT and IS ) and the various signiﬁcant aspects and characteristics of informational BOs ( including Huvila : authorship ; McKenzie : tem - porality ; Worrall , Anderson : technology ; and Westbrook , Huvila , and Hourihan Jansen : authority , control ) in different areas of IS re - search . 3 . PANELISTS AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS Isto Huvila , Åbo Akademi University Isto Huvila discusses the notion of BOs in the context of his re - search of documentary practices in archaeology . His analysis shows how archaeological investigation reports function as devices of control and hegemony between different stakeholder groups in the ﬁeld of archaeology ( Huvila 2011 ) . The writing of a report is an act of attempting to seize control over the meaning and signiﬁcance of a particular archaeological site . The authorship of the report makes the document a particular type of BO and inﬂuences the ways how the boundaries are negotiated and traversed between communities ( Huvila 2012 ) . Dr . Isto Huvila is a senior lecturer in information and knowl - edge management at the School of Business and Economics , Infor - mation Studies , Åbo Akademi University in Turku , Finland and an associate professor at the Department of ALM ( Archival Studies , Library and Information Science and Museums and Cultural Her - itage Studies ) at Uppsala University in Sweden . His primary areas of research include information and knowledge management , infor - mation work , knowledge organisation , documentation , and social and participatory information practices . Huvila has given numer - ous invited talks and published broadly on the topics ranging from information work management , archaeological information man - agement , social media , virtual reality information issues to archival studies and museum informatics . Theresa Dirndorfer Anderson , University of Technology Sydney Theresa Anderson discusses boundary objects as a notion , which resides in the interface of human - computer interaction ( HCI ) , com - puter supported cooperative work ( CSCW ) and library and infor - mation science . Anderson has drawn on the concept to study sys - tems , people , projects and documents , using the BO as an analyt - ical tool for examining the ensemble of people , information and technology . She has , for example , studied how the concept can be applied to explicate the functioning of a research project ( Light & Anderson 2009 ) and , for instance , from a conceptual perspec - tive in the context of information science as a notion that can help to identify various types of informative artefacts as socio - material forms ( Anderson 2007 ) . Anderson ﬁnds the boundary ob - ject concept particularly fruitful for recognising informative arte - facts ( books , documents , records , citations or other informative rep - resentations ) as socio - material forms . She draws on notions of in - scription and alignment closely associated with the boundary ob - ject construct to position these representational devices as central actors in the structuring of practices and technologies as alignments of both material and discursive practice . In this way the focus turns from representation as mental activity to inscription as social ac - tivity . In her presentation she will discuss how the interdisciplinary contexts of the notion can be helpful in framing and reframing cen - tral concepts in information science research . Dr . Theresa Anderson is a senior lecturer and faculty member at the Centre for Creative Practice and Cultural Economy , Univer - sity of Technology Sydney . Her research explores the relationship between people and emerging technologies . She has a particular interest in examining ways information systems and institutional policies might better support creative and analytic activities . Eva Hourihan Jansen , University of Toronto Eva Hourihan Jansen presents new ﬁndings from ﬁeldwork she conducted at a career mentoring program for skilled immigrants to Canada throughout early 2014 . Her study focuses on a standard occupational classiﬁcation system used to deliver the program and is among few taking an ethnographic approach to research in clas - siﬁcation and knowledge organization . She approaches her study sensitized to concepts of culture , including boundary objects , with an interest in interpreting her participation in ﬁeldwork . Her con - tribution to the panel will be to interrogate the explanatory power of boundary objects in the context of this inquiry into standardized occupational classiﬁcation . Eva Hourihan Jansen is doctoral candidate at the Faculty of In - formation , University of Toronto . She is interested in what happens at the intersections of knowledge organization systems and infor - mation practices . Currently she is studying a standard occupational classiﬁcation system as a way toward understanding and articulat - ing ways that people relate to and make meaning with it in their workplace . Pam McKenzie , The University of Western Ontario Pam McKenzie discusses the ways that everyday tools such as cal - endars , planners , lists , and reminders function as temporal bound - ary objects ( McKenzie & Davies 2010 ; Yakura 2002 ) for orches - trating complex activities with multiple timelines . She shows that the creation and use of temporal BOs embeds considerable infor - mation management work : the categorization of temporal units , the development and communication of working taxonomies , and the documentation and management of temporally - related information . Studying temporal BOs shows how everyday 21st century home life is itself complex , shaped by institutional as well as domestic temporalities and requirements . Dr . Pam McKenzie is an Associate Professor in the Faculty of Information and Media Studies at The Univesity of Western Ontario . She is interested in social , material , temporal , textual , and interactional aspects of information creation , seeking , sharing , and use , in the intersections between information work and caring work , and in gendered and embodied information practices , spaces , and places . Her research focuses on the ways that individuals in local settings collaboratively engage in information practices and the ways that those practices are embedded in broader discursive and social contexts . Lynn Westbrook , University of Texas Dr . Westbrook is an Associate Professor in the University of Texas School of Information . She will share her research on the use of information documents as boundary objects between professional sets of authoritative responsibility for women in crisis . The for - mally crafted print materials distributed to " crime victims " in do - mestic violence situations explicitly and implicitly deﬁne levels of engagement for the government ( as an abstract entity ) and social network of service providers . Dr . Westbrook has published exten - sively on women in domestic violence contexts and is currently working on information issues in the cervical cancer experience . Adam Worrall , The Florida State University Adam Worrall will present on the use of the boundary object con - cept and theory in social and community informatics research , fo - cusing on his recent study exploring the roles of social digital li - braries as boundary objects within and across communities . He asks whether and how they support and facilitate ( a ) coherence among the existing communities that use them and ( b ) convergence of new , emergent communities , as users interact , translate mean - ings and understandings , and use the digital library as a boundary object . His ﬁndings identify three different roles in community co - herence and convergence that should be supported by social digital libraries : ( a ) establishing community and organizational structure ; ( b ) facilitating users sharing of information values ; and ( c ) build - ing and maintaining social ties , networks , and community culture ( Worrall 2013a , b , 2014 ) . Worralls contribution to the panel will be to explicate the power of boundary object theory alongside theories of community for studies of digital libraries and other information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) from a social and commu - nity informatics perspective . Adam Worrall is a Doctoral Candidate at the Florida State University School of Information . His research interests focus on studying information and information behavior within and around the social and sociotechnical contexts of ICTs . Worrall is complet - ing a case study of the roles of the LibraryThing and Goodreads digital libraries and online communities , as boundary objects , in the existing and emergent communities that use them , through a theo - retical and analytical framework of Stars boundary object theory , Strausss social worlds perspective , and Burnett and Jaegers theory of information worlds . 4 .
