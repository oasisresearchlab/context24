All4One : A Moderated Sketching Tool for Supporting Idea - Generation with Remote Users Daejeon , South Korea Hyelip Lee , Seungwoo Je , Andrea Bianchi KAIST Industrial Design department 3 ) However , current remote collaborations are not physical and not moderated . 1 ) Good brainstorming is highly visual and physical ( Kelly et al . , 2001 ) 2 ) Benefit of Moderated Brainstorming ( Oxley et al . , 1996 ; Chan et al . , 2016 ) 1 . Research Background Early stage of design Tangible sketch - supporting tools Computer - supported collaborative drawing tools Bly et al . , 1990 Tang et al . , 1991 Ishii et al . , 1992 Kasahara et al . , 2012 Yuill et al . , 2013 Zhao et al . , 2014 Rekimoto & Sciammarella , 2000 Schkolne et al . , 2001 Zhen et al . , 2013 Lee et al . , 2014 Leon et al . , 2014 Surface studio , Tilt Brush 2 . Related Works ClearBoard ( CHI 1992 ) 2 . Related Works : Collaborative drawing tool But , they are all peer to peer interaction without moderation skWiki ( CHI 2014 ) Many drawing sharing tools for remote and also co - located people Easier and intuitive interaction with digital 2D , 3D drawings ToolStone ( UIST 2000 ) Tangeo ( CHI 2013 ) 2 . Related Works : Tangible drawing tools CurationSpace ( 2016 ) Most of them are not for remote collaboration 3 .

All4One : Mobile sketching application Drawing Area Controller Whiteboard view Touch for Capturing Built - in Camera 3 . All4One : Whiteboard system • Whiteboard • HD webcam • A beam projector 3 . All4One : Tangible MarkerTools Soft Potentiometer Push Button Marker Box Flip Swipe Press Flip Scale Change Color Move 3 . All4One : Working Prototype • Four graduated students from industrial design department - aged 21 to 32 years old ( M24 . 7 , SD 4 , 7 ) • Icebreaking with short demo of All4One system • One brainstorming moderator One collocated participant Two remote participants • Voice chat was opened in the background of the system • Concept design – a toy for children in 30 minutes • Post workshop interview 4 . Workshop How this system can be used in real setting for boosting idea generation ? 5 . Result • Three complete ideas for a toy ( a car , a bear , a mobile ) • Drawings + Voice chat + hand written text + gesture ( moderator ) Moderator • Collected and compared diverse ideas • Used a marker pen to draw over projected sketches 5 . Result Moderator • Superimposed ideas from different participants to add details • Assigned implicit roles to the participants to redraw specific parts • Combined ideas in a single sketch 5 . Result Participants • One participant sketched on a paper than took a picture to share it . • The other participant took a picture of a real product and sent it . 5 . Result • Resembles brainsketching ( Wan Der Lugt , 2002 ) : Accumulation of ideas , Keep adding details 6 . Discussion and opportunities for design 6 . Discussion and opportunities for design • Moderator use mixed tools : pen , eraser and marker tools • Due to the design setting , the moderator did more than moderating , a composer of an orchestra . • Working history ( more control on revision history ) • Expressiveness of drawing tools • Automatic identifying users • Option to select synchronous / asynchronous collaboration modality 7 . Limitation and future work 1 ) It is hard to do the early design process using current remote tools . 2 ) Good Brainstorming is visual and physical ( Kelly et al . , 2001 ) Summary 3 ) A Moderator can facilitate idea generation ( Oxley et al . , 1996 ; Chan et al . , 2016 ) All4One _ remote moderated drawing system tangible tools for a moderator tablet for remote participants Leila Hyelip Lee hyelip . lee @ gmail . com # Appendix # Appendix # Appendix
