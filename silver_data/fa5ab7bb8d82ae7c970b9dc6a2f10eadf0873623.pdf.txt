Phylogenetic trees constructed using predicted amino acid sequences of putative proteins of coronavirus HKU1 ( CoV - HKU1 ) revealed that CoV - HKU1 formed a distinct branch among group 2 coronaviruses . Of the 14 trees from p65 to nsp10 , nine showed that CoV - HKU1 was clustered with murine hepatitis virus . From nsp11 , the topologies of the trees changed dramatically . For the eight trees from nsp11 to N , seven showed that the CoV - HKU1 branch was the ﬁrst branch . The codon usage patterns of CoV - HKU1 differed signiﬁcantly from those in other group 2 coronaviruses . Split decomposition analysis revealed that recombination events had occurred between CoV - HKU1 and other coronaviruses . Introduction It has been estimated that coronaviruses [ human coronaviruses 229E ( HCoV - 229E ) and OC43 ( HCoV - OC43 ) ] cause about 5 – 30 % of respiratory tract infec - tions . In late 2002 and 2003 , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) , caused by SARS coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) , has resulted in more than 750 deaths [ 12 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 22 – 24 ] . In early 2004 , a novel coronavirus associated with respiratory tract infections , human coronavirus NL63 ( HCoV - NL63 ) , was discovered [ 3 , 20 ] . As a result of a unique mechanism of viral replication , coronaviruses have a high frequency of recombination [ 9 , 10 , 13 , 14 ] . ∗ These authors contributed equally to the manuscript . 2300 P . C . Y . Woo et al . : Coronavirus HKU1 phylogeny and recombination Coronaviruses were divided into three groups , with HCoV - 229E and HCoV - NL63 being group 1 coronaviruses and HCoV - OC43 a group 2 coronavirus respec - tively [ 11 ] . For SARS - CoV , it was initially proposed that SARS - CoV constituted a distinct group of coronavirus [ 15 , 17 ] . However , after more extensive phylogenetic analysis , it was discovered that SARS - CoV probably represents a distant relative of group 2 coronaviruses [ 2 , 18 ] . Further in silico analysis also predicted that SARS - CoV could be a product of recombination between mammalian and avian coronaviruses [ 19 ] . Recently , we have described the discovery of a novel coronavirus associated with pneumonia , coronavirus HKU1 ( CoV - HKU1 ) [ 21 ] . Based on analysis of the putative chymotrypsin - like protease ( 3CL pro ) , RNA - dependent RNA polymerase ( Pol ) , helicase , hemagglutinin - esterase ( HE ) , spike ( S ) , envelope ( E ) , membrane ( M ) and nucleocapsid ( N ) , CoV - HKU1 is a member of group 2 coronaviruses . However , the origin of CoV - HKU1 is still unknown . In this study , we performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis of CoV - HKU1 . Possible recombination events were predicted and the origin of CoV - HKU1 discussed . Materials and methods The predicted amino acid ( a . a . ) sequences of p65 , conserved portions of nsp1 [ papain - like protease 1 ( PL1 pro ) , Appr - 1 - p processing enzyme family ( A1pp ) , papain - like protease 2 ( PL2 pro ) , hydrophobic domain 1 ( HD1 ) , and hydrophobic domain 2 ( HD2 ) ] , nsp2 – 7 , nsp9 – 13 , HE , S , E , M and N were extracted from the CoV - HKU1 genome sequence ( GenBank accession no . AY597011 ) [ 21 ] . The corresponding a . a . sequences of murine hepatitis virus ( MHV ) , HCoV - OC43 , bovine coronavirus ( BCoV ) , porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus ( PHEV ) , rat sialodacryoadenitis coronavirus ( SDAV ) and pufﬁnosis virus ( PV ) were extracted from complete genome sequences of MHV ( GenBank accession no . AF201929 ) , HCoV - OC43 ( GenBank accession no . AY585229 ) and BCoV ( GenBank accession no . NC 003045 ) , and sequences of PHEV , SDAV and PV available in GenBank . The a . a . sequence of HE of MHV was extracted from MHV strain JHM ( GenBank accession no . BAA00661 ) because the HE gene in MHV ( GenBank accession no . AF201929 ) stopped prematurely after the 97th a . a . Phylogenetic tree construction was performed using neighbour joining method with ClustalX 1 . 83 . The corresponding a . a . sequences of HCoV - 229E were used as outgroups , except for p65 and HE because these were not available in the genome of HCoV - 229E . For p65 and HE , the corresponding a . a . sequences in SARS - CoV and inﬂuenza C virus were used as the outgroups respectively . Phylogenetic trees were not constructed for p28 and the predicted hypothetical protein of ORF4 and ORF8 in CoV - HKU1 because no a . a . sequences that can be used as the appropriate outgroups can be found . The amino - terminal 800 a . a . residues of the S proteins in various group 1 coronaviruses [ porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( TGEV ) , HCoV - NL63 and HCoV - 229E ] , various group 2 coronaviruses ( PHEV , SDAV , MHV , HCoV - OC43 and BCoV ) , infectious bronchitis virus ( IBV ) ( a group 3 coronavirus ) , SARS - CoV and CoV - HKU1 were aligned using ClustalX 1 . 83 . The presence and positions of conserved cysteine residues in the various peptides were compared . Correspondence analysis was used to compare the codon usage pattern variation in the different genes among group 2 coronaviruses in a multidimensional space [ 5 ] . All available sequences of ORF 1ab , HE , S , M and N of MHV , HCoV - OC43 , BCoV , PHEV , SDAV , PV and SARS - CoV were downloaded from the GenBank ( Table 1 ) . Analysis of codon usage in these F i g . 1 ( c on t i nu e d ) 2302 P . C . Y . Woo et al . Coronavirus HKU1 phylogeny and recombination 2303 sequences and the corresponding ones in CoV - HKU1 was performed using CodonW ( http : / / www . molbiol . ox . ac . uk / cu / ) , with each gene represented as a 59 dimensional vector , representing the 59 possible sense codons . AUG , the only codon for methionine , UGG , the only codon for tryptophan , and the three stop codons were excluded . The ORF for E was excluded because the length of the gene was too short . To delineate the importance of recombination on the evolution of CoV - HKU1 , split decom - position analysis was performed . Deduced a . a . sequences of group 1 , 2 and 3 coronaviruses and SARS - CoV available in GenBank , that were homologous to 3CL pro , Pol , helicase , HE , S , ORF4 , E , M and N in CoV - HKU1 [ 21 ] , were retrieved . Split decomposition analysis was performed with SplitsTree version 3 . 2 [ 7 ] using Hamming correction and is presented with the same edge length . Results The genome organizations of CoV - HKU1 and other group 2 coronaviruses were shown in Fig . 1a . Phylogenetic trees using predicted a . a . sequences of putative pro - teins and polypeptides of CoV - HKU1 and other group 2 coronaviruses were con - structed ( Fig . 1b ) . The putative proteins and polypeptides included p65 , conserved portions of nsp1 ( PL1 pro , A1pp , PL2 pro , HD1 and HD2 ) , nsp2 - 7 , nsp9 - 13 , HE , S , E , M and N . All trees revealed that CoV - HKU1 formed a distinct branch among group 2 coronaviruses . Interestingly , of the 14 trees of p65 to nsp10 , nine ( 64 % ) ( p65 , HD1 , HD2 , nsp3 , nsp4 , nsp6 , nsp7 , nsp9 and nsp10 ) showed that CoV - HKU1 was clustered with MHV ( Fig . 1b ) . However , for the eight trees of nsp11 to N , seven ( 88 % ) showed that the CoV - HKU1 branch appeared as the ﬁrst branch among group 2 coronaviruses ( Fig . 1b ) . Comparison of the cysteine residues in the N - terminal 800 a . a . residues of S in CoV - HKU1 and those in the different groups of coronaviruses revealed that almost all the conserved cysteine residues in group 2 coronaviruses were present in CoV - HKU1 ( Fig . 2a ) , supporting that CoV - HKU1 is a member of group 2 coronaviruses . The number of ORF 1ab , HE , S , M and N sequences in the group 2 coron - aviruses used for correspondence analysis is shown in Table 1 . The results of the (cid:1) Fig . 1 .

Axis 1 and 2 explained 36 . 6 % and 19 . 3 % of the variations in codon usage respectively . For ORF 1ab , HE , S and M , the scores on axis 1 in group 2 coronaviruses other than CoV - HKU1 were clustered between − 0 . 16 and 0 . 28 and those in CoV - HKU1 were clustered between − 0 . 40 and − 0 . 24 ( Fig . 2b ) . For N , the scores on axis 1 in group 2 coronaviruses other than CoV - HKU1 were clustered between 0 . 48 and 0 . 57 and that in CoV - HKU1 was at 0 . 11 ( Fig . 2b ) . These indicated that the codon usage patterns in the genes in CoV - HKU1 differed signiﬁcantly from those in other group 2 coronaviruses . Coronavirus HKU1 phylogeny and recombination 2305 Table 1 .

No evidence of recombination was shown between the N of CoV - HKU1 and those of other group 2 coronaviruses . Discussion CoV - HKU1 is a distinct member of group 2 coronaviruses . It was conﬁrmed by both phylogenetic analysis of 22 protein coding regions ( Fig . 1b ) and analysis of the conserved cysteine residues in the amino - terminal of the S proteins ( Fig . 2a ) that CoV - HKU1 is a group 2 coronavirus . Furthermore , phylogenetic analysis of the 22 protein coding regions revealed that there were 10 – 54 % a . a . differences between a particular protein coding region in CoV - HKU1 and the corresponding region in the most closely related sequence , indicating that CoV - HKU1 is distinct from the other group 2 coronaviruses . This fact was further supported by results of correspondence analysis of codon usage ( Fig . 2b ) . Recombination events were common among CoV - HKU1 and other group 2 coronaviruses . Coronaviruses have high frequency of homologous RNA recom - bination , which has been observed in both tissue culture [ 10 , 14 ] and experi - mentally infected animals [ 8 ] . In split tree analysis , recombination events would result in reticulations instead of simple branching structures . As shown in Fig . 3 , recombination was particularly frequent in CoV - HKU1 and MHV as compared to other group 2 coronaviruses such as BCoV and HCoV - OC43 . The particular high recombination frequency in MHV [ 1 ] is in line with evidence of a lot of inter - strain recombination , as shown by the high number of reticulations in various ORFs of the different MHV strains ( Fig . 3 ) . Complete genome sequencing of additional CoV - HKU1 and further split tree analysis would shed light on whether CoV - HKU1 behaves more like MHV or BCoV and HCoV - OC43 . 2306 P . C . Y . Woo et al .

Split decomposition graph of 3CL pro , Pol , helicase , HE , S , ORF4 , E , M and N in the CoV - HKU1 genome Coronavirus HKU1 phylogeny and recombination 2309 CoV - HKU1 may have originated from a major recombination event and nu - merous minor recombination events among group 2 coronaviruses . In feline coro - navirus , the site of recombination has been pinpointed to a region of about 50 nucleotides in the M gene by multiple alignment [ 6 ] . As for recombination between different strains of MHV , in vitro studies have shown both variable sites and rates of recombination , with the S gene have a frequency three fold that of the polymerase gene [ 4 , 14 ] . In CoV - HKU1 , nine of the 14 phylogenetic trees constructed using deduced a . a . sequences of p65 to nsp10 showed that CoV - HKU1 was clustered with MHV ( Fig . 1b ) . Interestingly , the topologies of the phylogenetic trees changed dramatically from nsp11 . For the eight trees from nsp11 to N , seven revealed that the CoV - HKU1 branch appeared as the ﬁrst branch among the group 2 coronaviruses ( Fig . 1b ) ( P < 0 . 01 by chi - square test ) . A logical explanation was that a major recombination event has taken place in the region between nsp10 and nsp11 when CoV - HKU1 ﬁrst appeared . However , this recombination event was not evident in multiple alignment performed at the junction between nsp10 and nsp11 ( data not shown ) . This is because although CoV - HKU1 is more clustered with MHV from p65 to nsp10 , the difference in phylogenetic distances between CoV - HKU1 and MHV and those between CoV - HKU1 and BCoV / HCoV - OC43 is not marked ( Fig . 1b ) , in contrast to what was observed in feline coronavirus [ 6 ] . Furthermore , bootscanning analysis in the whole genome did not reveal any putative recombination break point ( data not shown ) . We speculate that this could be due to numerous minor recombination events between p65 and nsp10 , such as between p65 and nsp1 - PL1 pro , between nsp1 - PL2 pro and nsp1 - HD1 , between nsp4 and nsp5 , and between nsp5 and nsp6 . This has resulted in CoV - HKU1 being clustered with MHV in only nine of the 14 phylogenetic trees constructed using deduced a . a . from p65 to nsp10 , but four of the 14 trees with the CoV - HKU1 branch being the ﬁrst branch among the group 2 coronaviruses .
