A R T I C L E S Electron tomography reveals unbranched networks of actin filaments in lamellipodia Edit Urban 1 , 3 , Sonja Jacob 1 , 3 , Maria Nemethova 1 , Guenter P . Resch 1 , 2 and J . Victor Small 1 , 4 Eukaryotic cells can initiate movement using the forces exerted by polymerizing actin filaments to extend lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions . In the current model , actin filaments in lamellipodia are organized in a branched , dendritic network . We applied electron tomography to vitreously frozen ‘live’ cells , fixed cells and cytoskeletons , embedded in vitreous ice or in deep - negative stain . In lamellipodia from four cell types , including rapidly migrating fish keratocytes , we found that actin filaments are almost exclusively unbranched . The vast majority of apparent filament junctions proved to be overlapping filaments , rather than branched end - to - side junctions . Analysis of the tomograms revealed that actin filaments terminate at the membrane interface within a zone several hundred nanometres wide at the lamellipodium front , and yielded the first direct measurements of filament densities . Actin filament pairs were also identified as lamellipodium components and bundle precursors . These data provide a new structural basis for understanding actin - driven protrusion during cell migration . During development and in the adult eukaryotic organism , migratory cells are required to crawl between other cells and penetrate connective tissue lattices in their mission to create or repair organs , to defend against intruders or disseminate during tumour metastasis . They achieve this using lamellipodia and filopodia , which are thin ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 μm ) sheets and rods , respectively , that protrude from the cell , leading migration . The major structural elements are actin filaments , which in lamellipodia form networks and in filopodia are arranged in bundles 1 – 6 . Actin filaments in lamellipodia and filopodia are polarized , with their fast - growing ( plus ) ends oriented towards the membrane 4 , 6 , and protrusion is driven by the nucleation and polymerization of actin at the membrane interface 7 – 10 . A widely accepted scheme of how lamellipodia protrude is the dendritic nucleation model of actin polymerization 11 – 14 . An integral component of this pathway is the Arp2 / 3 complex 15 , 16 , an actin - nucleator that localizes to lamellipodia 10 , 16 and whose depletion , or lack of activation through missing cofactors , suppresses lamellipodia formation 17 – 20 . Evidence that Arp2 / 3 regu - lates protrusion was provided by the reconstitution of actin - driven motion in vitro , in a protein cocktail containing , amongst other components , Arp2 / 3 , actin and beads carrying the carboxy - terminal WA domain of N - WASP ( a Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ) 21 . In lamellipodia , the Arp2 / 3 complex is activated by the WAVE ( WASP - family verprolin - homologous protein ) complex downstream of Rac 22 , 23 , and cycles with actin in a treadmilling mode 10 , with the WAVE complex concentrated at the lamellipodium tip 19 , 24 . When the WA domain of WAVE or N - WASP was mixed with actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex in solution , branched filaments were formed 13 , 25 , 26 , with the Arp2 / 3 complex localized at the branch points 27 , 28 . Concomitant with these in vitro findings , electron microscope images of lamellipodia ( in detergent - extracted keratocytes and fibroblasts ) showed actin filaments in the anterior region that appeared to be branched 6 , 29 . Together , these results provided compelling support for the dendritic nucleation model 14 . One feature of the dendritic model is a constant branch angle of approxi - mately 70° . Conversely , by correlating protrusion rate and actin organization in melanoma and adenocarcinoma cells , we recently showed that there is a wide angular distribution of filament orientations in actively protruding lamellipodia 30 . However , because the images obtained were two - dimensional ( 2D ) projections of densely packed three - dimensional ( 3D ) filament net - works , the existence of filament branches could not be rigorously excluded . Three - dimensional analysis of filament interactions has recently become possible through advances in transmission electron microscope instru - mentation and computing power , which have resulted in the development of electron tomography 31 , 32 ( in combination with rapid freezing to avoid chemical fixation ) . It has been shown that actin filaments can be visualized in tomograms of rapidly frozen Dictyostelium discoideum cells , although the location of the regions imaged relative to motile activity was not known 33 . We now report the results of electron tomography on lamellipodia from ‘living’ cells plunge - frozen in vitreous ice and on cytoskeletons embedded in deep - negative stain . Our findings with fibroblasts , keratocytes and melanoma cells show that the actin filament networks in lamellipodia are not composed of branched arrays . The tomography data provide new information about filament densities and arrangements at the lamellipodium tip , requiring a re - assessment of how actin filament modulators such as the Arp2 / 3 complex regulate the formation of actin networks to drive protrusion . 1 Institute of Molecular Biotechnology , Dr Bohr Gasse 3 – 7 , Vienna 1030 , Austria and 2 Research Institute of Molecular Pathology , Dr Bohr Gasse 3 – 7 , Vienna 1030 , Austria . 3 These two authors contributed equally to the work . 4 Correspondence should be addressed to J .

A RT I C L E S RESULTS Lamellipodial actin filaments in fish fibroblasts are not branched Migrating goldfish ( Carassius auratus ) fibroblasts spread out thinly on a planar substrate and protrude lamellipodial segments , flanked by filopo - dia 34 . Two tomograms of lamellipodial segments from fibroblasts frozen live in vitreous ice are shown in Figure 1a , b . The thickness of the lamel - lipodium in the frozen cells was measured as 150 ± 20 nm . Actin filaments were clearly visible in the processed tomograms ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Information , Movie S1 ) and could be tracked up to a few hundred nanometres along their length ( Fig . 1c ) . From the tracking of over 400 filaments in the frozen samples , no evidence was found for actin filaments branching from the sides of other filaments . Individual filaments from the model in Figure 1c are highlighted in Figure 1d and e to show their variable orientation within the lamellipo - dium leaflet . Actin filaments were commonly found in pairs , showing a constant inter - filament spacing of 14 . 0 ± 1 . 4 nm that often extended to the membrane . In comparison , the spacing between filopodial filaments in the same tomograms was measured as 12 . 2 ± 1 . 3 nm ( Fig . 1b ) . The tracking data indicated that the actin filaments terminated close to the cell membrane , but not exclusively at the lamellipodium tip . Filament ends were located on the dorsal and ventral membrane of the lamellipo - dium over a 300 – 400 nm - wide zone behind the front ( Fig . 1c – e ) . To date , it has not been possible to combine rapid freezing for cryo - electron tomography with high - resolution live - cell imaging on the light microscope .

A RT I C L E S and structure can be achieved by combining fixation on the fluorescence microscope stage with the negative - staining method 30 , 35 . In this procedure , the cytoskeleton is exposed by the inclusion of Triton X - 100 in the fixation mixture 1 , 2 . We combined this approach with electron tomography to obtain complementary information about lamellipodial architecture . The use of high concentrations of negative stain ( 5 – 10 % ) , or the inclusion of polyvi - nylalcohol in the stain mixture , yielded optimal contrast at 300 kV and also resulted in less collapse of the lamellipodium network , compared with the lower stain concentrations ( 2 – 3 % ) employed for conventional transmission electron microscopy . In figure 2 , the lamellipodium segment correspond - ing to the tomogram was protruding at 0 . 8 μm min – 1 at the time of fixation ( Fig . 2a – d ; for cell overview , see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . After embedding in deep - negative stain , the lamellipodium thickness in the cytoskeletons was approximately 60 nm , corresponding to approximately half the thickness observed for the frozen cells . Compared with previous 2D projections of negatively stained lamellipodia , obtained by conventional transmission electron microscopy 30 , the exceptional contrast of the actin filaments in the tomogram sections allowed tracking of individual filaments up to 1 μm or more behind the lamellipodium tip . A total of 360 filaments were tracked ( see Methods ) through the tomo - gram ( Fig . 2f , g and Supplementary Information , Movie S2 ) , including 114 that merged into the filopodium precursor bundle ( Fig . 2g , blue ) . Single filaments diverged at various angles from the front region of the lamellipodium and were linear or gently curved and unbranched . Filament pairs extending up to the lamellipodium tip were also observed . As with frozen cells , the front ends of the actin filaments , assumed to be the plus ends ( Fig . 2g – j , red and yellow points ) were concentrated around the surface of the lamellipodium tip within about 200 nm of the cell front ( Fig . 2h – j ) , with some as far back as 450 nm . The ends of the filaments contained in the bundle were located within 100 nm of the tip ( Fig . 2g , inset ) . Filament counts ( Fig . 2k ) from this and other goldfish fibroblast cytoskeletons showed filament densities in lamel - lipodia ranging from a maximum of 120 – 170 filaments per μm at 200 nm from the lamellipodium tip , decreasing to 80 – 140 filaments at 800 nm . A comparison of the filament counts made from the frozen cells and the cytoskeleton preparations indicated that there was no detectable loss of filaments from cells arrested by aldehyde / Triton fixation ( Fig . 2k ) . We searched for branches in tomograms of negatively stained lamellipodia by scanning the tomograms in the z - axis at every filament intersection . Putative branches were difficult to find : among 220 points of close fila - ment intersection analysed within 200 nm of the cell front , only eight putative branch sites were detected . Architecture of fish keratocyte lamellipodia Fish keratocytes are well - suited to structural studies of the locomo - tive machinery in lamellipodia because of their rapid and continuous migration in a characteristic fan - like shape 5 , 6 , 29 , 36 . In our hands these cells responded adversely to blotting of the bathing liquid before freezing . a b c d e f g z = 24 z = 27 z = 29 z = 33 z = 37 Figure 3 Actin filaments overlap and do not form a dendritic array in keratocyte lamellipodia .

A RT I C L E S We therefore studied them after fixation , with or without detergent in the fixation cocktail . Keratocytes are rapidly arrested with mixtures of glutaraldehyde and Triton X - 100 , or glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde , without any detectable distortion in shape ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a – d ) . A tomogram section of the front part of a keratocyte cytoskeleton lamellipodium prepared in this way and then vitreously frozen is shown in Supplementary Information , Fig . S2e . Individual fila - ments could be traced for at least 200 nm inwards from their anterior ends ( Supplementary Information , Movie S3 ) and in all cases were linear and unbranched ( 230 filaments tracked ) . Cross - sections of such tomo - grams showed the lamellipodium network tapered down to the tip . In tomograms of keratocyte aldehyde / Triton cytoskeletons embedded in deep - negative stain ( for overview see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1b ) , we observed a remarkable preservation of actin filaments , whereby the established two - stranded helical array of actin subunits 37 was clearly visible ( Fig . 3 ) . For these samples , low - dose imaging was unneces - sary and tilt series could be obtained around two orthogonal axes , both of which contributed to the improved resolution . Actin filaments close to the cell edge were mainly single and could be tracked to their tips ( Fig . 3b ) . Although there was a collapse of the lamellipodium network along the z - axis after negative staining ( to approximately 50 % of the value for frozen cytoskeletons ) many filaments could be tracked unambiguously over dis - tances of more than 1 μm ( Figs 3 and 4 ) . In total , more than 800 filaments were tracked in the best six of more than ten tomograms of the central , leading region of trout keratocytes . The unexpected clarity and structural preservation of the actin fila - ments in the lamellipodial networks allowed a critical evaluation of filament intersections . During tracking , tomograms were repeatedly scanned in the z - axis in an attempt to find instances in which one filament appeared to abut the side of another filament ( Fig . 3c – g and Supplementary Information , Movies S4a , b and S5 ) . Apparent branch points in one z - section were almost exclusively found to be sites of fila - ment overlap when adjacent z - sections were scanned . From tracking analysis , no evidence was found for a branched filament array in kera - tocyte lamellipodia . Some ambiguous situations arose in which a branch could not be rigorously excluded , but these were extremely rare ( red points in Fig . 3a , b ; Supplementary Information , Movie S4a , b ) , amount - ing to less than 2 % of points of close filament intersection ( overlaps marked in blue , Fig . 3a , b ; Supplementary Information , Movie S4a , b ) . Reconstructed tomograms ( Fig . 4a , b ) , as well as cross - sections of plastic - embedded , unextracted keratocytes ( Fig . 4c ) , show that the lamellipodium in these cells tapered towards the tip over a terminal region , approximately 1 μm wide . Tracking of filament trajectories in the tomograms showed that the taper arose from a staggered distribution of filament plus ends over the terminal zone on the ventral and dorsal surfaces , resulting in a ventral fringe ( Fig . 4b ) . This fringe corresponds to the brush zone described by Svitkina and Borisy 29 . At the lamellipodium tip , most filaments appeared as single entities , suggesting that they are nucleated and elongated as single filaments , although filament pairs ( interfilament spacing 13 . 7 ± 1 . 5 nm ) as seen in fibroblasts , were also observed ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S3 ) . The lamellipodial filaments were not arranged in stratified layers ; those with plus ends at the dorsal surface could be traced rearwards to the ventral surface and vice versa , with varying steepness in the z - direction . Filament counts showed that there was a rise from approximately 150 fila - ments per μm at 100 nm to more than 300 filaments at 1 μm ( consistent with the tapering front ) , decreasing to approximately 250 filaments at 2 μm ( Fig . 4a ) . The distribution of filament number , with a peak around 1 μm from the tip , also correlated with thickness measurements of lamellipodia taken from plastic cross - sections ( Fig . 4c ) .

A RT I C L E S ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1c ) . A typical tomogram section of a lamellipodium front in a negatively stained Triton / aldehyde cytoskeleton is shown in Supplementary Information , Fig . S4a . The anterior filament tips , assumed to be the plus ends , were again observed at the surface of the network in a zone at the cell front , extending over the first 300 – 400 nm . Filament tracking revealed that branches at the sides of actin filaments were extremely rare ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S4b , c and Movie S6 ) . Counts of filament numbers in the five best tomograms ( from a total of 15 ) yielded filament densities in the same range as for fish fibroblasts ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S5 ) . Negatively stained lamellipodia of B16 melanoma cells ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1d ) revealed the same general arrangement of actin and filament densities as that observed in tomograms of fibroblasts ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S4e – g and Movie S7 ) . In a collection of eight tomograms , we found no evidence for a branched filament array . By scanning through the tomograms , the number of filaments identified ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S5 ) , was two - fold higher than previously estimated from 2D images of B16 cell lamellipodia 30 , 39 , highlighting the advantage of using tomography . In both fibroblasts and melanoma cells , the diagonal meshwork extended throughout the depth of the lamellipodium ( see Supplementary Information , Movies S6 and S7 ) . By transfecting the cells with a GFP - tagged Arp subunit ( p16 Arp ; ref . 10 ) , we could follow the fate of Arp2 / 3 in live cells throughout the fixation process . Fluorescence of GFP – p16 Arp was retained in the aldehyde / Triton cytoskeletons used for electron microscopy ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S6 ) . In plas - tic sections , the lamellipodia of 3T3 and B16 cells were in the order of 100 nm thick , did not taper and exhibited rounded profiles at their tips ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S4d , h ) . Actin filament pairs Whereas the lamellipodium front of keratocytes had a mostly uniform distribution of diagonal filament arrays , actin filaments in fibroblast and melanoma cell lamellipodia were more diversely organized . This diversity could be attributed in part to the collection of filaments into bundled arrays of varying orientation and dimension , and to the less continuous protrusive activity of lamellipodia in these cell types 30 . At the lamellipodium tip , actin filaments that converged into focal sites ( Fig . 5a ) occurred alone ( Fig . 5b ) , or appeared as pairs of closely parallel filaments ( Fig . 5b , c ) . As already noted , filament pairs were evident in both frozen ‘live’ cells ( Fig . 1 ) and in cytoskeletons embedded in nega - tive stain ( Fig . 2 ) . The same pairs converged into higher - order bundles , including microspikes and filopodia ( Fig . 5d , e ) , suggesting that they represent an assembly step in bundle formation . However , pairs were also observed in keratocyte lamellipodia ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S3 ) in which bundles do not form , indicating they are also an integral part of the lamellipodial machinery . DISCUSSIon We provide the first 3D images of lamellipodia from vitreously frozen , live cells , revealing the organization of actin filaments in vivo . Our find - ings show , contrary to the prevailing dendritic branching hypothesis , that actin filaments are unbranched in lamellipodia . We conclude that the appearance of branches in previous work 29 arises from the surface coating of overlapping filament arrays with platinum in lamellipodia that have suffered collapse and distortion during critical - point dry - ing . In conjunction with the revised tracking analysis of actin speckle flow in lamellipodia 40 , our tomographic analysis also demonstrates that the lamellipodium is a separate , protrusive entity that does not surf , as recently proposed 41 , on an extension of the lamella . Why do we not see branches in vivo corresponding to those seen in vitro with mixtures of actin , Arp2 / 3 and the WA domain of WAVE ? In vivo , WAVE occurs in a tightly - regulated multi - protein complex 22 , 22 that is only active in the presence of lipid , namely when docked onto the plasma membrane 42 . We propose that when the unregulated C - terminal fragment of WAVE is free in solution in vitro , it can bind promiscuously to , and activate , Arp2 / 3 associated with the sides of existing ‘mother fila - ments’ 11 to produce branched arrays . The origin of corresponding ‘mother filaments’ in vivo has remained enigmatic 43 , as has the mechanism of appropriate positioning of such untethered filaments at sites of protru - sion . The absence of branches in lamellipodia removes the requirement for ‘mother filaments’ in vivo ; rather , the Arp2 / 3 complex interacts with WAVE to nucleate an actin filament only at the membrane interface 22 , 42 , and thereafter dissociates to treadmill with actin 10 . We have attempted to localize the Arp2 / 3 complex by immunogold labelling and electron microscopy . Unfortunately , the fixation of cells with aldehyde / Triton mix - tures that resulted in good cytoskeleton ultrastructure and retention of the Arp2 / 3 complex was too strong to allow proper penetration and labelling with immunogold probes . Conversely , weaker fixation conditions , which allow more immunolabelling , resulted in poor structural preservation , precluding any accurate conclusions about where the Arp2 / 3 complex is d e a b * c Figure 5 Schemes of actin filament organization .

A RT I C L E S positioned in the lamellipodial network . Improvements in probes and labelling procedures will be necessary to define the positions of actin - associated complexes in the delicate actin filament assemblies in cells . Nevertheless , the tomography data rule out any frequent association of filament minus ends with the sides of other filaments , excluding a second - ary function of Arp2 / 3 complex in cross - linking the network . The latter function is likely served by cross - linking proteins , such as filamin and α - actinin , which localize to lamellipodia 3 , 44 – 46 . A new model for lamellipodium protrusion is summarized in Figure 6 . We propose that a mutual collaboration between nucleation and elon - gation factors determines the ultimate organization of the actin network and its subsequent fate . As first proposed by Mullins and co - workers 13 , we suggest that the Arp2 / 3 complex rides on the pointed end of actin filaments after nucleation initiated by the WAVE complex . As filaments elongate , they remain tethered to the WAVE complex in an ‘actoclampin’ - like mode 47 . After initiation of a filament by WAVE / Arp2 / 3 complexes , VASP ( vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ) oligomers that are cou - pled with , or become coupled to WAVE ( possibly via a mutual link with IRSp53 ; refs 48 , 49 ) , take over the role of tethered elongation 50 . After relinquishing a filament to VASP , the WAVE complex is freed for further nucleation events with the Arp2 / 3 complex . We speculate that actin pair formation is initiated via two possible routes : either by the association of plus ends elongating on VASP that merge by lateral flow and link through further VASP – VASP , VASP – actin or VASP – partner interactions 50 , 51 , 52 , or by nucleation and elongation by formins 52 that can also localize to lamellipodial tips 53 , 54 . We cannot exclude here the possibility that WAVE also collaborates with a formin in nucleation and elongation events . The filament pairs are presumably stabilized by a short actin cross - linker , such as fascin 55 , 56 . Our findings with different cell types suggest that the clustering of filament pairs is a major route through which microspike bundles and filopodia are generated from lamellipodia . This transition requires the recruitment of a specific set of signalling and structural components to generate the filopodial tip complex 57 , 58 . More than one cross - linker is probably involved in bundling actin filaments , as sug - gested by the reduction in filament spacing from 14 nm in the pairs to 12 nm in the bundles . In Drosophila melanogaster , a consolidation of actin filaments occurs during the transition to higher - order bun - dles ( leading to the development of bristles ) , and is associated with the sequential recruitment of forked , followed by fascin 59 . Whether or not an analogous , sequential recruitment of actin cross - linkers is involved dur - ing the lamellipodia – filopodia transition remains an open question . As already discussed , cross - linking of filaments to form a structural network requires further actin - binding proteins , such as filamin and α - actinin . Immunogold labelling for filamin shows that it is localized throughout the lamellipodium to within 100 nm of the tip 44 , 60 . The filament counts , taken together with the plus - end distributions , are consistent with the initiation of filaments from an anterior membrane zone and a graded distribution of filament lengths . From the filament density and the lamellipodium thickness , we estimate the average spacing between the plus ends of actin filaments at the membrane to be approximately 30 nm , close to the tip . Many short filaments should be expected if fila - ments were being continuously nucleated , but this was not observed . The movement of Listeria monocytogenes , once initiated , can continue without further nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex 61 . By analogy , we suggest that nucleation in actively protruding lamellipodia is engaged to fill vacant spaces on the membrane , resulting for example , from variable rates of lateral flow of filament plus ends 30 and local recruitment of filaments into bundles . Further analysis will be required to assess the fraction of filament renewal required to maintain the observed filament distributions and , in particular , to establish the initial steps in lamellipodia formation . It has generally been assumed that other actin - based processes , includ - ing endocytosis and intracellular pathogen motility , operate using branched actin filament arrays 43 , 62 . Future structural analysis by electron tomography should reveal if these processes mimic the lamellipodial machinery .

( c ) VASP molecules associated with the WAVE complex take over the role of filament elongation ( as oligomers ) through common binding partners , releasing WAVE for further nucleation events . ( d ) Some growing actin plus ends tethered by VASP oligomers and associated proteins come together by lateral flow in the membrane and ( e ) initiate the formation of a filament pair through recruitment of an actin - bundling protein ( X - linker ) . ( f ) Filament pairs could also be nucleated and elongated directly by formins ( a doublet making up one ring ) in combination with a bundling protein . Finally , long cross - linking proteins ( such as filamin and α - actinin ) stabilize the network by forming filament interconnections ( not shown ) . For clarity , the filament density in the scheme is lower than in the real cell . 434 nature cell biology VOLUME 12 | NUMBER 5 | MAY 2010 © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved .

M E T H O D S DoI : 10 . 1038 / ncb2044 METhoDS Cell culture , transfection and fixation . Goldfish fin fibroblasts ( line CAR ; No . CCL71 ; American Type Culture Collection ) were maintained as described 34 and transiently transfected using Superfect ( Qiagen ) with pEGFP – β - actin ( Clontech ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . The support films used for electron microscopy were coated with fibronectin ( 50μg ml – 1 in PBS ; Roche ) , before plat - ing . B16 cells were cultured and then transfected with mCherry – actin and GFP – p16 ArpC5 ( the Arp2 / 3 complex subunit , p16 ArpC5 , labelled with GFP ) 10 , as previously described 30 . For electron microscopy , the support films were coated with laminin ( 25 μg ml – 1 ; Sigma ) and the cells were used 2 – 3 h after plating . Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were maintained in high - glucose Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 1 % penicillin , 1 % streptomycin , 1 % glutamine and 10 % fetal calf serum ( PAA Laboratories ) at 37 °C . 3T3 cells were cultured to con - fluency overnight and split the next day onto grids pre - coated with poly - l - lysine ( 0 . 01 % ; Sigma ) in serum - free medium for 1 h at 37 °C . The cells were simultane - ously extracted and fixed with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( Fluka ) and 0 . 25 % glutaraldehyde ( Agar Scientific ) in cytoskeleton buffer ( 10mM MES buffer , 150mM NaCl , 5mM EGTA , 5mM glucose and 5mM MgCl 2 , at pH 6 . 1 ) . An initial fixation of 1 min in this mixture was followed by post fixation for 15 min in cytoskeleton buffer ( containing 2 % glutaraldehyde and 1μg / ml – 1 phalloidin ) , to stabilize the actin filaments . The grids were then stored in cytoskeleton buffer containing 2 % glutaraldehyde with 10μg / ml phalloidin at 4 °C , before processing for electron microscopy . Negative staining was performed in mixtures of 4 – 8 % sodium silicotungstate ( SST ) in a range of 4 - 8 % at ( pH 7 ) , containing 10 nm BSA ( bovine serum albumin ) - saturated gold colloid diluted 1 : 10 from a gold stock ( see below ) . For preparation of keratocytes , scales from freshly killed brook trout ( Salvelinus fontinalis ) were transferred to plastic cell culture dishes containing start medium 63 and rinsed three times . After a 3 – 5 days incubation at 10 o C , extended monolay - ers of cells formed around the attached scales . Cultures were treated with 1mM EGTA in running buffer for 30 min to release individual cells ( K . Anderson , Beatson Institute , Glasgow , personal communication ) , which were subsequently washed with PBS , treated with 0 . 05 % trypsin - EDTA and re - plated onto grids or coverslips . The grids were re - incubated at 10 o C for at least 2 h before experiments . For cytoskeletons , cells were simultaneously fixed and extracted for 1 min in a mixture of 0 . 75 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 25 % glutaraldehyde in cytoskeleton buffer , post - fixed for 15 min in cytoskeleton buffer containing 2 % glutaraldehyde and 1 μg ml – 1 phalloidin and then kept overnight in cytoskeleton buffer containing 2 % glutaraldehyde and 1 μg ml – 1 phalloidin . The grids were negatively stained in aqueous , 4 % sodium silicotungstate ( Agar Scientific ) at pH 7 , containing BSA - saturated colloidal gold . For some experiments , a staining mixture of 2 % silico - tungstate and 0 . 5 % polyvinylalcohol ( M r 30 , 000 ; Sigma ) was used . For intact cells , keratocytes were fixed in a mixture of glutaraldehyde ( 2 % ) and formaldehyde ( 3 % ) in cytoskeleton buffer . Preparation of samples for Cryo - electron microscopy . For cryo - electron micro - scopy of fish fibroblasts , cells were plated in growth medium 34 onto Quantifoil R1 / 4 perforated carbon film on 200 - mesh Au grids , and allowed to spread over - night . Just before freezing , individual grids were transferred to a drop of medium containing BSA - saturated colloidal gold , diluted 1 : 10 from a gold stock . The grid was transferred to forceps in a grid - plunging device ( Leica EM - GP ) , sup - plemented with 3 μl of medium and BSA - saturated colloidal gold , blotted and immediately frozen by plunge - freezing into liquid ethane . During mounting and blotting , the grid was held in a chamber with controlled humidity and was blotted automatically for 2 – 3 s with humidified Whatman No . 1 filter paper applied to the backside of the grid to avoid any contact with the cells . The BSA - saturated gold particle stock was prepared as follows : 10 nm colloidal gold ( BBInternational ) was diluted 1 : 40 into 200mM sodium phosphate and BSA was then added from a stock solution of 5 mg ml – 1 in 5mM sodium phosphate at a dilution of 1 : 20 . The buffered gold colloid was vortexed , incubated for at least 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 1 h at 20 , 000 g . The supernatant was discarded and the red pellet containing dispersed gold particles was resuspended in water and then recentrifuged . The final , concentrated suspension was stored as a stock at 4 o C . Keratocytes on Quantifoil grids were plunge - frozen after being fixed as intact cells or as cytoskeletons ( see above ) . The grids were transferred to a drop of cytoskeleton buffer containing BSA - saturated colloidal gold and then vitreously frozen as for the living fibroblasts . Correlated light microscopy and electron microscopy . Fish fibroblasts and kera - tocytes were processed for correlated light and electron microscopy , as described 35 . In brief , cells were plated onto Formvar - coated coverslips embossed with a gold grid pattern before being filmed and fixed on the light microscope . Light microscopy was performed at room temperature on an inverted Zeiss Axioscope equipped with epifluorescence optics using a ×100 total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) lens in wide - field mode , and a halogen lamp as a light source ( Zeiss ) . Time - lapse images were recorded on a Roper Micromax , 512×512 rear - illuminated , cooled CCD camera controlled by Metamorph software at intervals of 15 s . After fixation , the films were detached from the coverslips under buffer , inverted , and floated on the buffer cell - side down . The central square of an electron microscope grid ( 100 mesh Cu / Pd ) was positioned over the region occupied by the filmed cells using a micromanipulator under a dissecting microscope 35 . The film / grid combination was recovered with a piece of Parafilm , and the cells were rinsed and dried in negative stain containing the gold colloid . Plastic cross - sections were made of cells embedded in plastic , as previously described 64 . Electron tomography . Tilt series of negatively stained cytoskeletons on Formvar coated NHF - A finder grids ( Maxtaform ) , and vitreously frozen cytoskeletons on Quantifoil R1 / 4 perforated carbon film on 200 - mesh Au grids , were acquired on a FEI Tecnai F30 Helium ( Polara ) microscope , operated at 300 kV and cooled to approximately 80 K for both types of specimen . Automated acquisition of tilt series was driven by SerialEM 65 versions 2 . 7 . x and 2 . 8 . x . Typically , the tilt range was – 60 to + 60 using the Saxton tilt scheme based on 1° increments ( negative stain ) and 2° increments ( cryofixation ) from 0° tilt , at a defocus value of – 5 μm and – 10 μm for the negatively stained and cryofixation samples , respectively . The total electron dose for the cryofixation tilt series was less than 70 electrons per Å 2 , and zero - loss images were recorded on a Gatan MSC 2k camera using an energy filter with a slit width of 20 eV . For the negatively stained samples , tomograms were generated from two tilt series obtained around orthogonal axes ( unless oth - erwise stated ) and images were recorded on a Gatan UltraScan 4000 CCD camera . The primary on - screen magnifications used for image acquisition were ×27 , 500 for the negatively stained samples and ×20 , 500 for the cryofixation samples . Image analysis . Re - projections from the tilt series were generated using IMOD software from the Boulder Laboratory for 3D Electron Microscopy of Cells 66 , using the gold particles as fiducials for alignments and the simultaneous iterative recon - struction technique ( SIRT ) algorithm for re - projections of the cryo - data . Filaments were manually tracked and models generated , also using IMOD . A typical tomo - gram comprised a z - stack of 100 – 150 sections , each nominally 0 . 75 nm ( negative stain ) or 1 . 5 nm ( cryofixation ) thick so that one actin filament diameter was tra - versed in a stack of 5 – 10 sections . By scanning a tomogram in the z - axis , the centre of a filament at any particular point was marked . Filament axis points marked along individual filaments ( see Supplementary Information , Movie S4b ) were joined as open contours in IMOD to create the track . Depending on the filament length , tracks of single filaments contained 3 – 40 filament axis points . Tracking was performed independently by four of the authors . Filament overlaps and putative branches were assessed by repetitively scanning a tomogram stack up and down in the z - axis , to follow the course of individual filaments . An intersection was defined as a position where two filaments approached within a filament diameter in the z - axis . If the end of one filament terminated at the side of another filament at the same level in the z - axis , it was marked as a putative branch . For filament counts , vertical planes were generated in the tomograms at different distances from the lamellipodium front . The tomograms were scanned in the z - axis and all filaments that crossed the planes were marked and scored ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S5 ) . Filtering of the cryofixation tomograms in 3D was performed using the non - linear anisotropic diffusion filter , as previously described 67 . 63 . Anderson , K . S . & Small , J . V .

The scan starts at the ventral surface of the lamellipodium , moves in Z to the dorsal surface ( marked by gold particles ) and then returns to the ventral surface , with the tracked filaments superimposed , finally merging into the model . The tomogram was generated from a single axis tilt series . Movie S2 Scan through tomogram and the filament model corresponding to fish fibroblast lamellipodium and microspike bundle in Fig . 2f , g . The scan starts on the support film close to the ventral surface , traverses to the dorsal surface in Z and returns to the ventral surface with the tracked filaments superimposed . In the last part of the video , most of the filaments have been deleted leaving some selected filaments ( in purple ) and the filament plus ends ( yellow ) to show the mixed orientation of filaments and the distribution of plus ends at the surface of the network . The tomogram was generated from a single axis tilt series . Movie S3 Scan through tomogram of keratocyte cytoskeleton embedded in vitreous ice and corresponding to Fig . S2e . At the end of the scan in Z , filament tracks are superimposed and the model rotated to reveal filament arrangements . Movie S4a Scan through tomogram corresponding to the keratocyte lamellipodium in Fig . 3a . The scan starts at the ventral surface and finishes at the dorsal surface . The blue rings correspond to hollow spheres ( appearing as rings in the tomogram sections ) placed at intersections where filaments overlap . The red rings correspond to hollow spheres marking sites where one filament appears to terminate at the side of another filament . Movie S4b Scan of tomogram as in movie 4a but with the filament tracks ( appearing as green dashes ) superimposed to indicate tracking routine . The filament model ( Fig . 3b ) was created by joining the tracking points . Movie S5 Scan through section of tomogram corresponding to Fig . 3c - g , showing overlapping events . Movie S6 Scan through tomogram and the filament model of the lamellipodium of a 3T3 fibroblast corresponding to Supplementary Information , Fig . S4a . The scan starts at the dorsal surface of the lamellipodium network , moves in Z to the ventral surface . After zooming in , the tomogram is scanned once more and the tracked filaments superimposed , finally merging into the model . The tomogram was generated from tilt series around two axes . Movie S7 Scan through tomogram and the filament model of the lamellipodium of a B16 melanoma cell corresponding to Supplementary Information , Fig . S4e . The scan starts at the dorsal surface of the lamellipodium network , moves in Z to the ventral surface . After zooming in , the tomogram is scanned once more and the tracked filaments superimposed , finally merging into the model . The tomogram was generated from tilt series around two axes . © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved .
