Ye 1 , 2 , Stuart Cane 1 , 2 & Thomas J . Maresca 1 , 2 High - ﬁdelity transmission of the genome through cell division requires that all sister kinetochores bind to dynamic microtubules ( MTs ) from opposite spindle poles . The application of opposing forces to this bioriented conﬁguration produces tension that stabilizes kinetochore – microtubule ( kt – MT ) attachments . Deﬁning the magnitude of force that is applied to kinetochores is central to understanding the mechano - molecular underpinnings of chromosome segregation ; however , existing kinetochore force measurements span orders of magnitude . Here we measure kinetochore forces by engineering two calibrated force sensors into the Drosophila kinetochore protein centromere protein ( CENP ) - C . Measurements of both reporters indicate that they are , on average , under B 1 – 2 piconewtons ( pNs ) of force at metaphase . Based on estimates of the number of CENP - C molecules and MTs per Dro - sophila kinetochore and envisioning kinetochore linkages arranged such that they distribute forces across them , we propose that kinetochore ﬁbres ( k - ﬁbres ) exert hundreds of pNs of poleward - directed force to bioriented kinetochores .

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : 13221 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms13221 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 1 T he forces that act on the kinetochore ( kt ) and how they are transduced depend on the nature of kt – microtubule ( MT ) interactions and the identity and number of force producers . Early in mitosis , kinetochores predominantly associate with the sides of MTs . The forces produced by kinetochore - associated motors laterally interacting with MTs are transmitted into sliding chromosomes directionally within the spindle . The major kinetochore - associated force producers at this stage are the plus - end - directed centromere protein ( CENP ) - E and the minus - end - directed dynein each of which are capable of producing forces in the low pN range ( B 1 – 8 pNs ) 1 – 4 . While motor - mediated forces produced during lateral kt – MT interactions facilitate proper chromosome congression 5 , 6 , they are neither sufﬁcient to satisfy the spindle assembly checkpoint nor to support accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis 7 . Rather , these outcomes require the formation of stable end - on kt – MT attachments that are mediated by a conserved MT - binding complex in the outer kinetochore called the KMN ( KNL - 1 , Mis12 complex , Ndc80 complex ) network 8 . End - on attached kinetochores must be able to harness the forces produced by MT dynamics to move chromosomes . MT polymerization exerts forces ( B 3 – 4pN ) similar to those produced by kinetochore motors 9 , while depolymerization of a single MT has been estimated to produce forces up to 65pN ( ref . 10 ) , an order of magnitude higher than individual motors . Poleward pulling forces applied to end - on attached kinetochores contribute to prometaphase congression , metaphase oscillations and anaphase A movements 11 – 15 . When biorientation is established , opposing poleward forces produce tension across sister kinetochores that stabilizes kt – MT attachments and contributes to spindle assembly checkpoint satisfaction 16 – 18 . There is a surprising lack of consensus about the magnitude of force that is applied to the kinetochore despite the fact that it is one of the most important force - transducing structures in the cell . In principle , very low forces are sufﬁcient to move non - bioriented chromosomes if the only opposing force is the viscous drag of the cytoplasm 19 . Indeed , analyses of anaphase chromosome movements in insect meiotic and mitotic cells yielded force estimates below 1pN ( refs 19 , 20 ) . However , the forces required for moving mono - oriented chromosomes poleward in prometaphase amphibian cells were estimated to be considerably higher and ranged between B 10 and 75pN ( ref . 21 ) . The discrepancy is likely a result of polar ejection forces and steric hindrance from astral MTs opposing prometaphase but not anaphase chromosome movements . Prometaphase poleward movements are mainly driven by lateral sliding along MTs by kinetochore - associated dynein 22 , but differences in prometaphase ( 10 – 75pN ) and anaphase ( o 1pN ) forces cannot simply be attributed to dynein producing higher forces than is generated by depolymerizing kt – MTs during anaphase . To the contrary , a landmark study employing calibrated microneedles concluded that anaphase k - ﬁbres in insect spermatocytes produced up to 700 pN ( 50pN per MT ) of poleward directed force 23 . It is worth noting that 50pN per MT may be an overestimate since it was based on the assumption that only microtubules spanning the kinetochore and pole , estimated to be B 15 out of B 45 kt – MTs , could effectively produce force . It has subsequently been shown that kt – MTs do not need to be linked directly to the pole to exert forces on the kinetochore 24 – 26 . Nonetheless , for simplicity and consistency’s sake , the original suite of per MT force estimates 27 will be referred to from here onward when discussing Nicklas’ spermatocyte studies . While the 700pN stall force was measured in anaphase , this number may better reﬂect the magnitude of force applied to metaphase kinetochores since the application of opposing force with a microneedle more closely resembles the bioriented conﬁguration than the typical anaphase scenario . However , measuring forces at bioriented kinetochores has presented a signiﬁcant challenge . Researchers recently estimated that the mean pericentromeric tension at bioriented yeast kinetochores is 4 – 6pN per MT ( and per kinetochore since the budding yeast kinetochore binds one MT ) 28 . This value ﬁts reasonably well with in vitro optical trapping studies using puriﬁed budding yeast kinetochore proteins and isolated kinetochore particles that have reconstituted associations with single MT plus ends over forces ranging from B 2 to 9pN ( reviewed in Yusko and Asbury 29 ) . Although forces above 20pN have been theoretically inferred 30 and directly measured for kinetochore proteins attached to beads via extended linkers 31 . While a general consensus ( within an order of magnitude ) may be emerging for the forces that are applied to budding yeast kinetochores , experimental measurements in metazoans have diverged markedly . In contrast to earlier measurements of 700pN per kinetochore ( 50 pN per MT ) 23 , a more recent optical trapping study in meiotic insect cells and N C Sensor N C Sensor Internal sensor ( Experimental ) : Force applied to sensor F F F F A A A A H3 H3 H3 H3 H3 H3 c N C S en s o r N C S en s o r C - Terminal sensor ( Control ) : No force applied to sensor A A A A H3 H3 H3 H3 H3 H3 Ndc80 Complex KNL - 1 CENP - C N C Mis12Complex TagRFP - T CENP - A Nucleosome Histone H3 Nucleosome RFP FL - CENP - C 1 1411 82 990 Outer kt - binding DNA / centromere - binding ClaI restriction site 599 Force sensors a b Dm CENP - C intrinsic disorder profile 1 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 C on f i den c e sc o r e 0 200 400 600 800 1 , 000 1 , 200 1 , 400 Amino acid position Likely disordered ( above dashed line ) Likely ordered ( below dashed line ) Figure 1 | Construction of the CENP - C - based force sensors and the experimental design for force measurements .

Thus , existing estimates of end - on - attached kinetochore forces in animals span two orders of magnitude . Drosophila S2 cells are an excellent model system to study kinetochore forces as sister kinetochores are generally under equal opposing forces because bioriented chromosomes do not oscillate . Furthermore , most other well - studied kinetochores possess multiple linkages between the DNA and the outer kinetochore , but the Drosophila kinetochore appears to possess a single linker molecule—CENP - C 33 . In this study we aimed to address the substantial inconsistencies in kinetochore force estimates by inserting Fo¨rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) - and talin - vinculin - based force sensors into CENP - C since it is ideally positioned as a force - transducing kinetochore component in Drosophila . Live - cell measurements of the two reporters yielded comparable estimates ( B 1 – 2 pN ) of the average amount of force applied per CENP - C reporter molecule at metaphase . MT dynamics , but not dynein , contributed to force production within the measurable range of the FRET - based reporter at bioriented kinetochores . We conclude that metaphase k - ﬁbres exert hundreds of pNs and posit that depolymerizing kt – MT plus - ends are the dominant poleward - directed force producers at bioriented Drosophila kinetochores . The ﬁndings have implications for understanding the fundamental interplay between force and kinetochore structure , function and evolution . Results Measuring kinetochore forces with a FRET - based sensor . CENP - C constitutively localizes to the centromere throughout the cell cycle . It associates with centromeric DNA through its C terminus 34 – 36 and its N terminus binds directly to the outer kinetochore 37 , 38 while the rest of the protein , especially in Drosophila , is predicted to be highly disordered ( Fig . 1a , b ) . The behaviour of force reporters inserted into the central unstructured region of CENP - C were compared with negative controls in which the sensors were placed at the C terminus so that they would not be subjected to force ( Fig . 1c ) . Stable cell lines expressing each of the force reporters were used in all the experiments and there were no evident dominant negative effects to engineering CENP - C in the manners described . The ﬁrst CENP - C force reporter was built using a modiﬁed version of a spider - silk - based FRET sensor called TSMod ( tension sensor module ) 39 , comprised of the FRET pair mTurquoise2 and mVenus ﬂanking an elastic linker ( Fig . 2a ) . The application of force to TSMod leads to reduced FRET and , notably , the FRET sensor has been calibrated and shown to report on forces in the 1 – 6 pN range . Insertion of the TSMod reporter into CENP - C did not evidently disrupt its function as chromosome alignment was indistinguishable between control cells and cells treated with dsRNA targeting the 3 0 - untranslated region ( 3 0 - UTR ) of the CENP - C transcript to knockdown ( with B 50 – 60 % efﬁciency ) the endogenous CENP - C ( Fig . 2b ) .

Interphase cells , which do not have assembled kinetochores , were used as the no / low force condition while bioriented metaphase kinetochores were the higher force condition . First , the FRET emission ratio ( FRET signal / donor ( mTurquoise2 ) signal ) of the reporter was measured . A statistically signiﬁcant 7 % decrease ( P value o 0 . 005 ) in the FRET emission ratio was measured in metaphase compared with interphase cells expressing the internal TSMod ( Fig . 2d ; Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . The metaphase reduction in FRET was not a result of cell cycle effects on the behaviour of the reporter and was dependent on the internal positioning of the sensor as there was not a statistically signiﬁcant difference ( P value 4 0 . 05 ) in the FRET emission ratio of the C - terminal TSMod in interphase versus metaphase cells . While the reduction in FRET emission ratio indicated that the internally positioned TSMod was under greater tension in metaphase than in interphase , it was not feasible to estimate the magnitude of force applied to CENP - C from the change in the emission ratio as the reporter was originally calibrated based on changes in FRET efﬁciency . To overcome this limitation , acceptor photobleaching was applied to measure the FRET efﬁciency of the CENP - C TSMod reporters ( Fig . 3a ) . In this approach , the FRET efﬁciency is measured by quantifying the extent to which the ﬂuorescence intensity of the donor ( mTurquoise2 ) increases following photobleaching of the acceptor ( mVenus ) . In general agreement with the FRET emission ratio measurements , a statistically signiﬁcant B 12 . 5 % decrease ( P value o 0 . 005 ) in the FRET efﬁciency of the internal TSMod reporter was measured in metaphase ( 20 . 7 ± 0 . 5 % ( s . e . m . ) FRET efﬁciency ) compared with interphase ( 23 . 6 ± 0 . 6 % FRET efﬁciency ) while there was not a statistically signiﬁcant ( P value 4 0 . 05 ) change in the FRET efﬁciency of the C - terminal reporter ( Fig . 3b ; Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Chromosome biorientation was required to generate tension as the FRET efﬁciency of the internal TSMod at kinetochores associated with monopolar spindles following depletion of kinesin - 5 was indistinguishable from interphase measurements ( Fig . 3b ) . Importantly , there was negligible ( o 0 . 5 % ) or no detectable bleed - through from the TagRFP signal into any of the relevant channels used in the FRET - based imaging approaches ( Supplementary Fig . 1c , d ) . The live - cell FRET efﬁciency measurements compared remarkably well with the FRET efﬁciency – force estimation of the TSMod developed from single molecule calibrations 39 . Based on the published force estimation curve , the CENP - C - TSMod data are consistent with each CENP - C molecule experiencing forces below the limit of detection in interphase and , on average , B 1 . 2 – 1 . 4 pN at bioriented kinetochores ( Fig . 3c ) . MT dynamics contributes to metaphase force generation . The MT - stabilizing drug taxol was next used to assess the contribution of MT dynamics to kinetochore forces . Addition of greater than B 20 – 50 nm taxol to Drosophila S2 cells results in monopolar spindles , but bipolar spindles form more frequently in the presence of higher concentrations of taxol following depletion of the minus - end directed motor dynein 40 . Dynein heavy chain ( Dhc ) RNAi treatment exhibited the expected phenotype of a signiﬁcant increase in metaphase cells . While normal metaphase forces were measured at bioriented kinetochores in DMSO - treated cells following Dhc RNAi , addition of 500 nM taxol resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant ( P value o 0 . 05 ) increase in the FRET efﬁciency of the internal CENP - C - TSMod reporter at bioriented kinetochores in n . s .

Thus , MT dynamics , but not the minus - end - directed motor protein dynein measurably contribute to force production , within the range of detection of the internal CENP - C - TSMod reporter , at bioriented kinetochores . Measuring kinetochore forces with focal adhesion components . To corroborate the FRET - based measurements , a second CENP - C force reporter was designed based on the focal adhesion protein talin and its binding partner vinculin . Single molecule experiments with the talin rod ( TR ) domain demonstrated that the application of force to the molecule increased the number of associated vinculin head ( VH ) molecules purportedly by exposing vinculin binding sites in the TR domain ( Fig . 4a ) 41 . As with the TSMod reporter , the TR domain was inserted into either the middle of TagRFP - T - CENP - C to measure force or at the C terminus to serve as a negative control ( Fig . 1c ) . Cell lines were built that expressed both VH - EGFP and the CENP - C - TR force sensors based on the hypothesis that the application of force to the TR domain in CENP - C should increase the number of bound VH molecules ( Fig . 4b ) . As observed for the TSMod force sensor , insertion of the TR reporter into the middle of CENP - C did not disrupt its function as chromosome alignment was normal in CENP - C - TR - expressing cells depleted of endogenous CENP - C ( Fig . 4c ) . Importantly , VH - EGFP localized to kinetochores in a CENP - C - TR - dependent manner ( Fig . 4d ) . To quantify the number of VH molecules associated per TR domain , a ﬂuorescence correction ratio was determined before imaging the experimental conditions by imaging a reference CENP - C protein with an equal number of EGFP and TagRFP - T ﬂuorophores ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The correction ratio was then applied to the measured ﬂuorescence intensities of VH - EGFP and Tag - RFP - T - tagged CENP - C - TR , which were imaged using the identical imaging parameters as the reference conditions . Since the assay involved a two - component system and the VH - EGFP was distributed through the cytoplasm , nucleoplasm and centromeres during interphase , the low / no force condition was created by generating unattached kineto - chores through treatment with the MT - depolymerizing agent colchicine . The internal TR - reporter - associated with an average of B 0 . 9 ± 0 . 02 VH - EGFP molecules in colchicine - treated cells . There was not a signiﬁcant difference ( P value 4 0 . 05 ) between VH molecules bound per TR in colchicine - treated and metaphase cells expressing the C - terminal reporter although the mean number of VH molecules per TR was lower ( B 0 . 75 ± 0 . 03 ) for the C - terminal reporter .

Fluorescence measurements were not impacted by the fact that TagRFP - T and EGFP is a FRET pair as FRET was not detectable in either metaphase or colchicine - treated cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3b – d ) . In prior work , the number of VH molecules per TR domain was counted in the absence of force and after applying 2 or 12 pN to single TR molecules with a magnetic trap 41 . While these measurements were done in vitro rather than in living cells , we feel that the approach employed here is bolstered by the fact that a comparable number of VHs per TR was measured in vitro in the absence of applied force and in colchicine - treated cells expressing the internal TR reporter ( Fig . 4f ) . The measurement of B 1 . 3 VH molecule bound per internal TR domain in living cells is slightly below the average number of VH molecules bound to a TR domain under 2 pN of force applied in vitro ( Fig . 4f ) . Discussion The TSMod - and TR - based reporters indicated that each CENP - C molecule experiences , on average , B 1 – 2 pN of force at bioriented kinetochores . It is important to recognize that both the FRET efﬁciency measurements and VH counting numbers come from ensembles of molecules some of which are likely in a resting state and others that are in a tense state . Furthermore , since all the measurements are done in the presence of endogenous CENP - C it is possible that the load could be shared unequally between the tagged and untagged CENP - C molecules or distributed through a greater number of CENP - C molecules than are typically present . Thus , the 1 – 2 pN per CENP - C estimate by no means excludes that forces are differentially distributed through individual CENP - C linkages , and may even underestimate the magnitude of force that can be applied to CENP - C . Nevertheless , the average estimate provides a solid framework from which to parlay our experimental ﬁndings into a reasonable proposal for a physiologically relevant range of forces produced by individual kt – MTs and the k - ﬁbre as a whole . Our MT and k - ﬁbre estimates are based upon a generally accepted concept of the structural organization of the kinetochore ( reviewed in Rago and Cheeseman 42 ) , measurements of the number of CENP - C molecules 43 – 45 and kt – MTs 46 per Drosophila kinetochore , and the force per CENP - C molecule measured here ( Fig . 5 ) . The upper and lower limits of the proposal are deﬁned by the range of force per CENP - C ( 1 – 2 pN ) and previously reported Drosophila CENP - C counting experiments 43 – 45 based on a ﬂuorescent standard ( 12 – 31 per MT ) . In Drosophila , we posit that the force produced by a single MT at mature bioriented attachments is distributed between CENP - C molecules arranged as a set of parallel springs that connect to the MT through the Mis12 complex and the Ndc80 complex . It would therefore hold that the force a single MT generates would be the number of CENP - C molecules ( 12 – 31 ) multiplied by the force applied to each CENP - C molecule ( 1 – 2 pN ) meaning that , on average , a kt – MT exerts B 12 – 62 pN of poleward - directed force . The total force applied to the kinetochore would equal the force per MT multiplied by the number of MTs in the k - ﬁbre . Since there is an average of 11 microtubules bound to Drosophila S2 cell kinetochores 46 , we propose that a typical bioriented kinetochore in these metazoan cells experiences between B 135 and 680 pN of poleward - directed pulling forces . This magnitude of force differs signiﬁcantly from that measured in live - cell optical trapping experiments 32 , but largely agrees with the classic cell - based microneedle experiments in insect cells 23 , 27 as well as with the force estimate from a recent study combining experimentation and computational theory in mammalian cells 47 . We favor the interpretation that the depolymerizing kt – MT plus - end is the dominant poleward - directed force producer at bioriented Drosophila kinetochores for several reasons : ( 1 ) our estimate of up to 62pN per kt – MT nearly equals measurements of the maximum amount of force depolymerizing MT plus - ends generate in vitro 10 , ( 2 ) suppressing plus - end MT dynamics with 500 nM taxol reduces the amount of force at bioriented kinetochores . Prior work concluded that 1 m M taxol was necessary to fully suppress MT dynamics in S2 cells 40 ; unfortunately , sufﬁcient numbers of bioriented kinetochores could not be measured in 1 m M taxol . While the data indicate that dynein is not a major force generator at metaphase kinetochores , regulators aside from MTs may contribute since 500 nM taxol did not reduce the force to interphase levels . We cannot exclude the possibility ; however , that 500 nM taxol dampens but does not fully suppress MT dynamics . Interestingly , since kinetochore / centromere associated kinesin - 13 family members are capable of depolymerizing taxol - stabilized MT ends 48 , it would be worthwhile to further investigate the contribution of these motors to force generation at bioriented kinetochores . It is also noteworthy that just 10nM taxol is sufﬁcient to reduce kt – MT ﬂux by 4 90 % in S2 cells 49 and so our data do not rule out k - ﬁbre ﬂux as a contributor to metaphase force generation . Given that k - ﬁbres ﬂux and pull , and that polymerizing and depolymerizing MTs are present within the same kinetochore 50 , 51 , the relative contributions of kt – MT polymerization versus plus ( and perhaps minus ) - end depolymerization to kinetochore force transduction remains an open and important question , which has recently been investigated using FRET - based Ndc80 reporters in budding yeast 52 . We hypothesize that kt – MT plus - end depolymerization sets the maximum force applied to bioriented kinetochores and that FMT = FCENP - C X # CENP - C molecules per MT Low High FCENP - C 1 pN 2 pN # CENP - C per MT FMT 12 . 3 * 30 . 8 * * 12 . 3 pN 61 . 5 pN # kt - MTs + 11 11 Max Fkt 677 pN 135 pN Fkt = FMT X # kinetochore - microtubules CENCENP - C - C Mis12Mis12ComplexComplex Ndc80Ndc80ComplComplex A simple Drosophila kinetochore model : Linkages arranged as a set of parallel springs Figure 5 | An estimate of the magnitude of force applied to bioriented kinetochores . The Drosophila kinetochore is envisioned as linkages between the DNA and the kt – MT arranged as a set of parallel springs that distribute forces produced by MT dynamics through them . In Drosophila , the known path from the DNA to the MT is CENP - C , the Mis12 complex , and the MT - associating Ndc80 complex . For simplicity , Dm Spc105 / KNL - 1 has been omitted . The TSMod - and TR - based force sensors reported that each CENP - C molecule experiences , on average , B 1 – 2pN of force . If the poleward force produced by a kt – MT is equally distributed across the CENP - C linkages then , based on CENP - C counting experiments , each kt – MT could generate between B 12 and 62pN . Since there are 11 MTs bound to S2 cell kinetochores , if each kt – MT applies maximum poleward force then the total force applied to the kinetochore would be as high as 135 – 677pN . * Measured by Schittenhelm et al . 45 based on Cse4 standards from Joglekar et al . 43 * * Adjusted 2 . 5 - fold based on recalibrated ﬂuorescence measurements by Lawrimore et al . 44 þ Measured in Drosophila S2 cells by Maiato et al . 46 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms13221 6 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : 13221 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms13221 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications this limit must be highly conserved since it is derived , at its most fundamental level , from GTP hydrolysis 11 , 53 . Thus , kinetochores likely emerged and evolved in the presence of an evolutionarily ﬁxed maximum force generator—the depolymerizing kt – MT . A common evolutionary strategy to building a kinetochore appears to have involved distributing k - ﬁbre forces through a sufﬁcient number of linkages such that individual components are not subjected to very high forces that would denature them or damage the underlying DNA . Deﬁning the physical properties of force - transducing kinetochore components as well as how forces are transmitted across them will provide fundamental mechanical insights into kinetochore function , and cell division in general . Why would cell division in metazoan cells beneﬁt from having k - ﬁbres capable of applying hundreds of pNs to kinetochores when much lower forces are sufﬁcient to move chromosomes ? It is possible that the ability of k - ﬁbres to produce high forces allows for proper resolution of merotelic attachments in anaphase 54 or for segregating chromatids to plow through unexpected obstacles that may arise . However , because the measurements here are in close agreement with Nicklas’ estimates of the amount of force ( 30 pN per MT ) required to stabilize kt – MT attachments 27 , we propose that the application of hundreds of pNs to kinetochores is most critical before anaphase to stabilize the geometrical conﬁguration with the best segregation prospects—bioriented attachments . Methods Drosophila S2 cell lines . All cell lines were cultured in Schneider’s ( Life Technologies ) media supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum and 0 . 5 (cid:2) antibiotic - antimycotic cocktail ( Life Technologies ) , maintained at 25 (cid:2) C . Transgenic cell lines were generated by transfecting DNA constructs using the Effectene Transfection Reagent system ( Qiagen ) , following manufacturer protocol . Protein expression was conﬁrmed by ﬂuorescence microscopy . Cells were split in the presence of Blasticidin S HCl ( Fisher ) and / or Hygromycin ( Sigma ) to select for expressing cells . DNA constructs . The pMT - TagRFP - T - CENP - C construct was generated in mul - tiple steps : ( 1 ) CENP - C was ampliﬁed from the cDNA , with 5 0 SpeI and 3 0 SacII sites and inserted into pMT - V5 B vector ; ( 2 ) endogenous CENP - C promoter was ampliﬁed from genomic DNA with 5 0 XbaI site and 3 0 KpnI site and inserted into the above plasmid puriﬁed from dam - / dcm - Escherichia coli ; ( 3 ) TagRFP - T was ampliﬁed with 5 0 KpnI and 3 0 SpeI sites , and inserted between the promoter and CENP - C . Then , CENP - Cprom - TagRFP - T - CENP - C was ampliﬁed from the above construct with ﬂanking XbaI sites and inserted into pMT - V5 B vector puriﬁed from dam - / dcm - E . coli to generate pMT - CENP - Cprom - TagRFP - T - CENP - C . To generate the tension sensor module ( TSMod ) construct , mTurquoise2 and mVenus were ﬁrst inserted into pMT - V5 B vector between KpnI and SpeI sites , and NotI and SacII sites , respectively to build pMT - mTurquoise2 - mVenus . The spider silk DNA sequence with ﬂanking homology regions to mTurquoise2 / SpeI site ( 5 0 end ) and NotI / mVenus ( 3 0 end ) was synthesized ( Life Technologies ) and inserted between mTurquoise2 and mVenus in the pMT - mTurquoise2 - mVenus plasmid by Gibson assembly . To generate the CENP - C - TSMod construct , the TSMod was ampliﬁed from the above construct with primers upstream of mTurquoise2 and downstream of mVenus with ﬂanking ClaI sites , and inserted into pMT - CENP - Cprom - TagRFP - T - CENP - C puriﬁed from dam - / dcm - E . coli . To generate the control construct with the tension sensor in the C terminus of CENP - C , a ClaI site was engineered into a pMT - CENP - Cprom - TagRFP - T - CENP - C ( no stop codon ) construct by inserting annealed complementary oligos encoding a ClaI site ﬂanked by XbaI sites down - stream of CENP - C at the XbaI site and the TSMod was then inserted into this newly engineered ClaI site as the internal ClaI site in CENP - C was methylated . The CENP - C - TR construct was generated by amplifying talin rod domain ( aa 482 – 889 ) from chicken gizzard cDNA ( Zyagen ) with ﬂanking ClaI sites , and inserted into the pMT - CenpCprom - TagRFP - T - CENP - C construct described above . To generate the control construct , in which talin rod was at the 3 0 end of CENP - C , the rod domain was ampliﬁed with ﬂanking XbaI sites and inserted downstream of CENP - C . To generate the VH - GFP construct , the vinculin head domain ( aa 1 – 258 ) was PCR ampliﬁed from a vinculin - mVenus construct [ a gift from Martin Schwartz ( Addgene plasmid # 27300 ) ] with 5 0 KpnI and 3 0 XbaI sites and inserted into the pMT - V5 B vector with the EGFP sequence between the XbaI and SacII sites . The CENP - C promoter was then inserted upstream of the vinculin gene with ﬂanking KpnI sites to drive expression . Double - stranded RNA production . DNA templates for Dhc64C ( CG7507 ) , KLP61F ( CG9191 ) , and CENP - C 3 0 - UTR ( CG31258 ) were produced to contain B 500bp of complementary sequence ﬂanked by T7 promoter sequence . Double - stranded RNAs ( dsRNAs ) were synthesized overnight at 37 (cid:2) C from the DNA tem - plates using the T7 RiboMax Express Large Scale RNA Production System ( Promega ) following manufacturer protocol . For RNAi , media was aspired off semi - adhered cells at 25 % conﬂuence , replaced with 1ml of serum - free Schneider’s medium containing 20 m g of dsRNA , and after 1h , 1ml of fresh Schneider’s plus FBS was added to the wells and incubated for 2 ( Dhc , Klp61F ) or 4 ( CENP - C ) days at 25 (cid:2) C . Western blot . A total of 20 m g of protein was loaded onto a 10 % SDS – PAGE gel , run out , and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane on the Trans - Blot Turbo transfer system ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) for 15min . All antibodies were diluted in TBS with 0 . 1 % Tween and 5 % milk . The membrane was ﬁrst incubated with anti - CENP - C serum ( gift from Bibi Mellone ) at 1 : 7 , 500 , followed by anti - Ndc80 antibody ( made in house ) at 1 : 5 , 000 as a loading control . Guinea pig ( 703 - 035 - 155 ) and chicken ( 706 - 035 - 148 ) HRP secondary antibodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) , diluted at 1 : 5 , 000 , were used in conjunction with their respective primaries and imaged with a GBox system controlled by GeneSnap software ( Syngene ) . ImageJ was used to measure band intensities and the CENP - C signal was normalized to the Ndc80 loading control to determine the knockdown efﬁciency . Uncropped images of the western blots are shown in Supplementary Fig . 4 . FRET ratio imaging and analysis . Cells were allowed to adhere to acid - washed , concanavalin A ( Sigma - Aldrich ) coated coverslip ( Corning ) for exactly 1h , then assembled into a rose chamber containing Schneider’s media with drugs or solvent control , when appropriate and subjected to imaging at 25 (cid:2) C . Cells were imaged for a maximum of 1h on a TiE inverted microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with an iXON EMCCD camera ( Andor Technology ) using a 100 (cid:2) 1 . 4 numerical aperture Plan Apo violet - corrected series differential interference contrast objective ( Nikon ) . Metamorph software ( Molecular Devices ) was used to control the imaging system . For imaging the TagRFP - T - CENP - C - TSMod FRET reporter , mitotic cells were identiﬁed by the presence of paired sister centromeres and the absence of a nucleus , and the best focal plane was determined in the RFP channel . Sequential images of mTurquoise2 , mVenus and FRET were taken with equal exposure times . Background - corrected ﬂuorescence intensities for mTurquoise2 and FRET were measured in Metamorph software using region - in - a - region background subtraction by drawing concentric larger and smaller regions manually in MetaMorph around clusters of kinetochores / centromeres that were in focus . The reported FRET emission ratios represent the ratios of the background corrected FRET over the background corrected mTurquoise2 total intensities . The following equations were used : Backgroundsignal ¼ Integratedfluorescenceintensity largerarea (cid:3) Integratedfluorescenceintensity smallerarea LargerArea (cid:3) SmallerArea ð 1 Þ TotalIntensity ¼ Integratedfluorescenceintensity smallerarea (cid:3) Backgroundsignal (cid:2) SmallerArea ð Þ ð 2 Þ Bleed - through of the TagRFP - T into the CFP , YFP and FRET channels was measured by imaging TagRFP - T - a - tubulin - expressing cells under identical conditions as the FRET imaging experiments . Background corrected CFP , YFP , and FRET signals in MT - containing regions were then ratioed to the TagRFP signal from that region . Acceptor photobleaching FRET . Cells were seeded onto a Concanavalin A - coated acid - washed coverslip and allowed to adhere for 1h . For Dhc RNAi experiments , cells were incubated for 1h in taxol or 0 . 1 % DMSO after allowing them to adhere to the coverslips for 1h and imaging was done for a maximum of 60min following the 1h drug or DMSO treatment . Coverslips were then assembled into a rose chamber containing Schneider’s media ( containing 500nM taxol or 0 . 1 % DMSO where appropriate ) and imaged at 25 (cid:2) C . All images were collected using a TiE inverted microscope ( Nikon ) coupled with A1R laser scanning confocal system ( Nikon ) using a 60 (cid:2) 1 . 4 NA Plan Apo objective ( Nikon ) . Elements ( Nikon ) was used to control the imaging system . Best focal plane was determined by taking a single image using the 561nm laser . Single plane images were acquired using the 445 and 514nm lasers pre - and post - photobleaching . To photobleach the acceptor ﬂuorophore , a square region was drawn around a metaphase plate or interphase centromeres , and photobleached with the 514nm laser , using a 50mw laser at 55 % laser power . All image quantiﬁcations were done using Fiji Image J software . A region was drawn around individual kinetochores / centromeres in pre - and post - photobleach images to obtain the mTurquoise2 ( donor ) integrated intensity , which was corrected by subtracting the background signal obtained by placing the same sized region in the cytoplasm / nucleoplasm of the same cell . The following equation was applied to obtain the FRET efﬁciency : FRET eff ¼ 1 (cid:3) Intensity donor ð pre - bleach Þ Intensity donor ð post - bleach Þ All statistical analyses were performed using R or Prism . While mTFP1 was replaced with mTurquoise2 in the TSMod reporter used in this study , we feel that it NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms13221 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : 13221 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms13221 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 7 is appropriate to present a force estimate from our reporter that is based on the theoretical calibration of the original TSMod 36 because the two reporters exhibit identical zero - force FRET efﬁciencies and have comparable Fo¨rster radii . Bleed - through of the TagRFP - T into the CFP and YFP channels was measured by imaging TagRFP - T - a - tubulin - expressing cells under identical conditions as the acceptor photobleaching experiments . Background corrected CFP and YFP signals in MT - containing regions were then ratioed to the TagRFP signal from that region . Talin rod—vinculin imaging and analysis . Cells co - expressing CENP - C - TR and VH - EGP were seeded near full conﬂuency in 500 m l volume onto concanavalin A coated acid - washed coverslips . After 20min the volume was brought up to 2mls with fresh Schneider’s media ( þ 0 . 1 % DMSO or 25 m M colchicine ) and assembled into a rose chamber B 40min after seeding . For colchicine - treatments , the cells were treated with 25 m M colchicine for 60min before seeding them onto coverslips . The cells were then imaged on the microscope described above ( in ‘FRET ratio imaging and analysis’ ) between 45 and 90min post seeding . Mitotic cells were identiﬁed as described above and the best focal plane was determined in the RFP channel and sequential images of TagRFP - T and EGFP were taken with equal exposure times . Background - corrected ﬂuorescence intensities for TagRFP - T and EGFP were measured using region - in - a - region background subtraction as described above . To obtain the correction ratio , cells expressing TagRFP - T - CENP - C - EGFP and treated with 0 . 1 % DMSO were imaged before each experiment using identical imaging conditions as would be applied to the experimental conditions . Region - in - a - region background subtraction was applied to measure the ratio of GFP to RFP signal intensities ( the GFP signal was typically B 3 . 5 (cid:2) greater than that of RFP under the imaging conditions ) . Since TagRFP - T - CENP - C - EGFP has equal numbers of EGFP and TagRFP - T molecules , the correction ratio determined for that day was used to determine the number of VH molecules per TR in the experimental conditions by dividing the background corrected VH - EGFP to TagRFP - T - CENPC - TR ratio by the correction ratio . For example , if the correction ratio for a given day was measured to be 3 . 5 and the ( background corrected ) ratio of VH - EGFP to TagRFP - T - CENP - C - TR kinetochore signals was measured to be 7 then the number of VH per TR would be 2 . This method does not count the total number of TRs or VHs per kinetochore but rather the number of VH molecules per CENP - C - TR . To investigate if FRET was occurring between TagRFP - T tagged CENP - C - TR and VH - EGFP , cells were imaged on an Eclipse Ti - E inverted microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with a Borealis ( Andor ) retroﬁtted CSU - 10 ( Yokogawa ) spinning disk head and ORCA - Flash4 . 0 LT Digital CMOS camera ( Hamamatsu ) using a 100 (cid:2) 1 . 49 numerical aperture Apo differential interference contrast objective ( Nikon ) . Cells expressing either EGFP - a - tubulin or TagRFP - T - a - tubulin were imaged and background corrected signals from EGFP ( donor ) and TagRFP - T ( acceptor ) into the FRET channel ( GFP excitation , RFP emission ) in MT - containing regions were ratioed to the background corrected tubulin signal from that region to deﬁne the spectral bleed - through ( bt ) into the FRET channel ( B 6 % for EGFP , and B 12 % for TagRFP - T ) . TagRFP - T tagged CENP - C - TR and VH - EGFP expressing cells were then imaged under identical imaging conditions as the tubulin - expressing cells and corrected FRET ( cFRET ) was determined by subtracting the donor and acceptor bt from the background corrected raw FRET signal using the following equation : cFRET ¼ rawFRET (cid:3) EGFP bt (cid:3) TagRFPT bt The corrected FRET values were divided by the donor ( EGFP ) intensity and reported as a cFRET ratio .
