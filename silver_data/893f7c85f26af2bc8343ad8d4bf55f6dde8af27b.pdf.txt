Abstract 24 Small populations ( e . g . , hospitals , schools or workplaces ) are characterised by high contact 25 heterogeneity and stochasticity affecting pathogen transmission dynamics . The increased 26 availability of empirical individual contact data provides unprecedented information to 27 characterize such heterogeneity . However , these detailed data are usually collected over a 28 limited period , and can suffer from observation bias . We propose an algorithm to 29 stochastically reconstruct realistic temporal networks from individual contact data in health 30 care settings ( HCS ) and test this approach using real data previously collected in a long - term 31 care facility ( LTCF ) . 32 Our algorithm generates full networks from recorded close - proximity interactions , using 33 hourly inter - individual contact rates and information on individuals’ wards , the categories of 34 staff involved in contacts , and the frequency of recurring contacts . It also provides data 35 augmentation by reconstructing contacts for days when some individuals are present in the 36 HCS without having contacts recorded in the empirical data . Recoding bias is formalized 37 through an observation model , to allow direct comparison between the augmented and 38 observed networks . 39 The algorithm successfully reconstructed unobserved contacts , and was substantially more 40 accurate to reproduce network characteristics than random graphs . The reconstructed 41 networks reproduced well the assortativity by ward ( first – third quartiles observed : 0 . 54 – 0 . 64 ; 42 synthetic : 0 . 52 – 0 . 64 ) and the hourly staff and patient contact patterns . Importantly , the 43 observed temporal correlation was also well reproduced ( 0 . 39 – 0 . 50 vs 0 . 37 – 0 . 44 ) , indicating 44 that our algorithm could recreate a realistic temporal structure . The daily degree ( 10 . 8 – 14 . 7 45 vs 14 . 7 – 18 . 0 ) , density ( 0 . 07 – 0 . 08 vs 0 . 08 – 0 . 10 ) and global efficiency ( 0 . 39 – 0 . 43 ; 0 . 46 – 0 . 49 ) 46 were slightly overestimated . 47 To conclude , we propose an approach to generate realistic temporal contact networks and 48 reconstruct unobserved contacts from summary statistics computed using individual - level 49 interaction networks . This could be applied and extended to generate contact networks to 50 other settings using limited empirical data , to subsequently inform individual - based epidemic 51 models . 52 .

For diseases transmitted mostly via close - proximity interactions , the rate at 55 which individuals come into contact with each other is strongly correlated with the expected 56 spread of the disease across the population [ 1 ] . In large populations such as cities or countries , 57 contact structures can be approximated by grouping individuals into relatively broad 58 categories ( neighbourhood , age… ) , and assuming that contact rates are heterogeneous 59 between categories , but homogeneous within [ 2 , 3 ] . In small populations such as healthcare 60 institutions , schools , or workplaces however , disease transmission is affected by high contact 61 heterogeneity and stochasticity [ 4 ] . Capturing these characteristics requires a detailed , 62 individual - level description of contacts . 63 Contact networks are increasingly used to fully capture the interactions between individuals 64 in small populations [ 5 , 6 ] . These networks explicitly represent the links between all individuals 65 in such populations , as opposed to contact matrices which only capture average contact rates 66 between groups of individuals [ 7 , 8 ] . Temporal contact networks further capture the time - 67 changing nature of contacts , therefore representing individual interactions more accurately 68 than static networks [ 9 – 13 ] . Contact networks can be coupled with individual - based 69 mathematical models to help design effective interventions against the spread of infectious 70 diseases , since they enable the identification of highly connected individuals who can be 71 targeted to lead to the greatest impact on transmission [ 8 ] . Recently , empirical data collected 72 to build inter - individual temporal networks has become increasingly available . For example , 73 previous studies have used sensors to record close - proximity interactions between individuals 74 [ 14 , 15 ] , and contact tracing programs have relied on the integrated Bluetooth technology in 75 mobile phones [ 16 ] . 76 However , the detailed empirical data required to build temporal contact networks remain 77 subject to several limitations [ 17 , 18 ] . Even studies designed to collect such data are usually 78 limited in time , and may be subject to observation bias ; sensors might not be properly placed 79 to register contacts [ 19 ] , or individuals may disable Bluetooth on their mobile phones at 80 different times [ 16 ] . Due to the resulting missed contacts , the networks derived from these 81 data may only be partially observed . Transmission rates estimated using these partially 82 .

To validate this approach , we use close - proximity data 89 collected in a long - term care facility ( LTCF ) during the i - Bird study [ 1 ] . We compute summary 90 contact parameters from these data to generate reconstructed contact networks and compare 91 these synthetic contact networks with the observed i - Bird data . 92 .

This study took place in a rehabilitation and long - term care 96 facility ( LTCF ) from the beginning of July to the end of October 2009 . Over this period , each 97 participant ( patient or hospital staff ) was wearing an RFID sensor that recorded close - 98 proximity interactions ( CPIs , at less than 1 . 5m ) every 30 seconds . Here , we only used contacts 99 recorded between 27 July to 23 August 2009 ( included ) . This period corresponds to the weeks 100 between two sensor battery replacements and hence avoids interference due to loss of 101 contact . A temporal network of proximities was therefore available over 28 days with 102 information on individual ID and ward of affectation . 103 The hospital was structured into five wards : three neurological wards , one nutritional care 104 ward and one geriatric ward . Patients were systematically linked to a ward , whilst some staff 105 were mobile and not linked to a specific ward . For the purpose of this work , we consider here 106 that mobile staff belong to an “artificial” 6 th ward , to compute contact rates according to the 107 algorithm detailed below . Staff were divided into 13 professions : administrative , 108 animation / hairdresser , logistic , hospital service agent , porter , occupational therapist , 109 physiotherapist , other re - education , nurse , head nurse , care assistant , student / intern , and 110 physician . A total of 200 patients and 213 hospital staff were included and had contacts 111 recorded during the 28 days of study . 112 We used hospital staff schedules to determine the hourly presence of each staff . We 113 compared these schedules , as well as admission and discharge dates of patients , to the dates 114 and times when individuals had any contact recorded . Through this , we estimated that there 115 was on average no contact data recorded for 37 % ( standard deviation : 30 % ) of a patient’s 116 presence days , and 42 % ( sd : 38 % ) for staff ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . The raw i - Bird network , 117 measured directly from the sensors , is therefore an incomplete representation of the real 118 inter - individual proximity network over the period and underestimates the number of 119 contacts in the hospital . Interestingly , at the population level , there was no correlation 120 between the proportion of presence time during which contact data were recorded for a given 121 .

This algorithm generates a new synthetic network which notably 129 reconstructs contacts over days when individuals were known to be present in the hospital 130 but had no contact data recorded , which we consider to be a recording bias . The synthetic 131 network hence includes both the observed and unobserved parts of the empiric network . This 132 approach first involves the calculation of contact rates and durations between individuals , 133 stratified by the individuals’ ward , category ( patient , or staff profession ) , type of day ( weekday 134 or weekend ) and hour . The algorithm then reconstructs a new network , taking as input these 135 summary statistics as well as data on presence days for each individual in the facility . Each CPI 136 is generated stochastically , with individuals chosen in order to promote recurring contacts , 137 based on a probability estimated from the data . 138 139 Estimation of contact rates from the i - Bird data 140 Contact rates per hour ( h from 00h to 23h ) , category of individual ( C i , i . e . patient , or hospital 141 staff profession ) and ward W i are estimated from the data as : 142 𝑇 (cid:3035) , (cid:3030) (cid:3117) (cid:3050) (cid:3117) →(cid:3030) (cid:3118) (cid:3050) (cid:3118) = ∑ ∑ ∑ (cid:3023) (cid:3284) , (cid:3285) , (cid:3286) (cid:3263)(cid:3283) , (cid:3284) (cid:3286)(cid:3128)(cid:3117) (cid:3285)∈(cid:3252)(cid:3118)(cid:3272)(cid:3118) (cid:3284)∈(cid:3252)(cid:3117)(cid:3272)(cid:3117) ∑ (cid:3015) (cid:3252)(cid:3117)(cid:3272)(cid:3117) , (cid:3170) (cid:3263)(cid:3283)(cid:3287) (cid:3128) (cid:3117) ( 1 ) 143 where T h , c1w1  c2w2 is the average per - person contact rate at the hour h between individuals 144 from category C 1 belonging to the ward W 1 and individuals from category C 2 belonging to the 145 ward W 2 . For given hour h and individual i , N h , i is the number of instances of the hour h where 146 at least one contact was recorded for that individual . For example , if i had a contact recorded 147 on Tuesday 11 th August at 10h , and on Tuesday 18 th August at 10h , N 10 , i would be equal to 2 . 148 For two individuals i from C1W1 and j from C2W2 , V i , j , k indicates whether contacts have been 149 recorded on occurrence k : it equals 1 if i and j had at least one contact recorded at the instance 150 .

Finally , N h is the total number of instances of the hour h in 151 the full dataset and , for a given instance l of the hour h , N C1W1 , l is the number of individuals 152 from C 1 W 1 that had any contact recorded during that hour . 153 154 This estimation was conducted separately for contacts during weekdays and contacts during 155 weekends . 156 157 Estimation of recurring contacts 158 For each individual i , we calculate the probability of recurring contact for each day d between 159 the first ( d 0 ) and last ( d max ) days where a contact was recorded for i , according to 160 𝑝 (cid:3036) , (cid:3031) = | (cid:3022) (cid:3284) , (cid:3279) ∩(cid:3022) (cid:3284) , [ (cid:3279)(cid:3116) , (cid:3279) ] | | (cid:3022) (cid:3284) , (cid:3279) | ( 2 ) 161 Where U i , d is the set of unique individuals with whom i had a contact on day d , and U i , [ d0 , d ] is 162 the set of unique individuals with whom i had at least one contact on any day between the 163 first day d 0 and the current day d . For example , if i had a contact with four unique individuals 164 on day d , and previously had a contact with two of those on any day between d 0 and d , the 165 probability of recurring contact for day p i , d would be 2 / 4 = 0 . 5 . 166 167 We then calculated the mean probability of recurring contacts for individual i across all days 168 as 169 𝑝 (cid:3036) = ∑ (cid:3043) (cid:3284) , (cid:3279) (cid:3279)(cid:3288)(cid:3276)(cid:3299)(cid:3279)(cid:3128)(cid:3279)(cid:3116) (cid:2869)(cid:2878) ( (cid:3031) (cid:3288)(cid:3276)(cid:3299) (cid:2879)(cid:3031) (cid:3116) ) ( 3 ) 170 Finally , we calculated the mean probability of recurring contacts by individual category c 171 ( patient or staff ) as 172 𝑝 (cid:3030) = ∑ (cid:3043) (cid:3284) (cid:3284)∈(cid:3252) | (cid:3004) | ( 4 ) 173 Where C represents the set of individuals belonging to category c . 174 175 Generation of synthetic CPIs : number and individuals in contacts 176 For each hour of our period of interest , we estimate the number of contacts between 177 individuals present in the hospital during that hour , determined using the admission data and 178 staff schedule collected during the i - Bird study . We generate the number of individuals n from 179 category C 2 S 2 in contact with an individual i from category C 1 S 1 during an hour h by sampling 180 .

Before 181 selecting these n individuals , since contacts are generated dynamically , we check if i is already 182 included in the contacts of individuals from C 2 S 2 during h . If n’ individuals from C 2 S 2 have 183 already had a contact with i during h , we only select n = n - n’ new individuals from those 184 available , in order to avoid double counting . 185 186 These n individuals are selected by favouring contacts between individuals who have already 187 met at any other time previous to h . Let p c be the probability of a recurring contact for 188 category c ( patient or staff ) of the individual i . To determine the identity of the n individuals 189 in contact with i , we draw a random number r ~ Uniform ( 0 , 1 ) 190  If r ≤ p c , a recurring contact is generated : j is chosen among S , the subset of C 2 S 2 191 individuals who previously met i , according to probability p i  j : 192 𝑝 (cid:3036)→(cid:3037) = (cid:3015) (cid:3284)→(cid:3285) ∑ (cid:3015) (cid:3284)→(cid:3286) (cid:3286)∈(cid:3268) ( 5 ) 193 Where 𝑁 (cid:3036)→(cid:3037) is the number of previous contacts between i and j before hour h , and 194 𝑁 (cid:3036)→(cid:3038) is the number of previous contacts between i and each individual k belonging to 195 S . 196  Otherwise , the contact is not recurring : the individual j in contact is randomly and 197 uniformly chosen among S’ , the subset of C 2 S 2 individuals who have not yet met i . 198 199 Generation of contact durations 200 We generated the duration of contact between two individuals ( i from C 1 S 1 and j from C 2 S 2 ) 201 by sampling from a log - normal distribution . This distribution was calibrated using the mean 202 and variance of the duration of contact at the hour h between two individuals from C 1 S 1 and 203 C 2 S 2 , estimated from the data . 204 205 Observation bias process 206 As mentioned earlier , in any real - life data , it can be assumed that there are periods of non - 207 recording of CPIs ( bias in collection ) . For each individual in the observed network , we 208 identified the hours when they had no contact recorded . We then removed those individuals 209 on those hours before proceeding with the algorithm described above . Hence , the 210 reconstructed biased network and the observed network suffer from the same bias and are 211 comparable . 212 .

For comparison , we also generated 100 216 pseudo - random contact networks with observation bias , and 100 without . The latter networks 217 simulate contacts without taking into account the ward , staff category , and probability of 218 recurring contact in the calculation of contact rates and durations . At each contact , the 219 individual encountered is therefore chosen randomly from all those present in the hospital at 220 that time , regardless of whether or not the individual was previously encountered . 221 222 We implemented the algorithm in C + + with the repast HPC 2 . 3 . 0 library . All simulations were 223 performed on the Maestro cluster hosted by the Institut Pasteur . The networks were analysed 224 in R [ 27 ] , using the igraph package [ 28 ] . The relevant contact networks and analysis code are 225 available in the following GitHub repository : https : / / github . com / qleclerc / network _ algorithm . 226 227 Validation of the full reconstructed networks 228 For validation , we also applied the algorithm to each of the 100 reconstructed networks with 229 bias , to generate 100 new full reconstructed networks and confirm these “re - simulated 230 networks” were similar to the full reconstructed networks generated from the observed data . 231 232 .

The contact network is considered undirected , since contacts are assumed to be 237 reciprocal . Daily - averaged contact matrices built from these data are described in a previous 238 work [ 1 ] . 239 240 We first summarise the observed temporal network , comparing the total network and 241 subgraphs with only patient - patient , staff - staff , or patient - staff contacts ( Figure 1a - d ) . Table 242 1 provides the degree , global efficiency , density , transitivity , assortativity and temporal 243 correlation of these four networks . The mean degree of the total network per day is 12 . 99 244 ( standard deviation : 3 . 53 ) , which corresponds to the average number of unique contacts per 245 individual per day . In the subgraphs , the degree is highest in the patient - staff subgraph ( 8 . 09 ; 246 sd : 1 . 89 ) , although we still note a relatively important number of patient - patient contacts , 247 with a degree of 5 . 25 ( sd : 1 . 87 ) in the corresponding subgraph . The distribution of individual 248 degrees for all individuals and all days across the total network is heterogeneous , with a 249 squared coefficient of variation equal to 0 . 44 ( Figure 1e ) . The global efficiency of the total 250 network is 0 . 40 ( sd : 0 . 05 ) , meaning that on average the shortest path between any two 251 individuals has a distance of 2 . 5 ( whereby the shortest path between two individuals in direct 252 contact would be of distance 1 ) . As expected , the efficiencies are lower in the subgraphs , since 253 we remove individuals and hence increase the distance between those remaining ( patient - 254 patient : 0 . 25 ( sd : 0 . 08 ) , staff - staff : 0 . 32 ( sd : 0 . 10 ) , patient - staff : 0 . 31 ( sd : 0 . 05 ) ) . Densities in 255 the total network and subgraphs are relatively low ( < 0 . 1 ) , indicating that less than 10 % of all 256 possible connections between individuals in the network are actual observed connections . 257 258 Transitivity in the total network is high ( 0 . 37 ; sd : 0 . 02 ) , meaning that for any two individuals a 259 and b both in contact with the same third individual c , the probability that a and b are also in 260 contact is 0 . 37 . Transitivity is also high in the patient - patient and staff - staff subgraphs , but 261 this metric is not relevant for the patient - staff subgraph – it is impossible for a triangle of 262 .

Assortativity by degree is negative in the total network ( - 0 . 13 ; sd : 0 . 10 ) , indicating that 264 highly connected individuals are more likely to be in contact with less connected individuals . 265 It is also strongly negative in the patient - staff subgraph ( - 0 . 42 ; sd : 0 . 14 ) , reflecting the 266 expected disassortivity of healthcare contacts , where each staff member is in contact with 267 multiple patients , whilst each patient is contact with relatively few staff members . In the 268 patient - patient and staff - staff subgraphs , assortativity by degree is positive , as frequently 269 seen in social networks . 270 271 Table 1 : Summary of network characteristics for the observed total network , patient - patient 272 subgraph , staff - staff subgraph , and patient - staff subgraph .

This is 287 reflected in the assortativity by ward , which is systematically high ( > 0 . 45 ) and indicates that 288 individuals in a ward are always more likely to have contacts with other individuals in the same 289 ward than with individuals in other wards ( Table 1 ) . We also observe that contacts exist 290 between all grouped staff professions and patients in different wards , although the 291 distribution is heterogeneous ( Figure 2a - b ) . For example , the median number of wards with 292 which a care assistant ( orange ) is in contact with is two , while almost all porters ( yellow ) have 293 contacts with patients from all five wards ( Figure 2b ) . 294 295 Overall , contacts are relatively well maintained over time , as shown by the temporal 296 correlation coefficient of 0 . 47 ( sd : 0 . 11 , Table 1 ) . This corresponds to the average probability 297 that , between two subsequent days , an individual maintains the same number of unique 298 contacts , with the same individuals . This metric is highest in the patient - patient subgraph 299 ( 0 . 65 , sd : 0 . 07 ) and lowest in the patient - staff subgraph ( 0 . 35 , sd : 0 . 16 ) , indicating that 300 patients tend to have the same contacts with each other every day , whilst contacts amongst 301 healthcare workers often vary between subsequent days . This consistency over time is 302 reflected in the probability of recurring contacts ( mean probability : 0 . 78 for patients , 0 . 71 for 303 staff ) , although we note more variability amongst staff than patients ( Figure 2c ) . 304 305 All the characteristics described above differ between weekdays and weekends in the network 306 and indicate that there are fewer contacts during weekends ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . This 307 difference is reflected in the temporal correlation , which tends to be high when comparing 308 Sunday to Saturday , but low when comparing Saturday to Friday and Monday to Sunday , 309 indicating that the structure of the network changes the most between these timepoints 310 ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . 311 .

We expected that the characteristics of the reconstructed 334 networks with observation bias would be broadly similar to those of the observed i - Bird 335 network . Summary network characteristics are reported in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 336 4 . 337 338 The daily degrees in the reconstructed networks were slightly higher than the observed 339 network ( Figure 3a ) . Global efficiency was similar between the observed and reconstructed 340 networks , but slightly higher in the reconstructed network with bias ( Figure 3b ) . This is 341 because the algorithm with bias removed individuals from the network at times when they 342 did not wear their sensor during the study , hence reducing the average distance between 343 remaining individuals . For the same reason , the density of the reconstructed network with 344 bias was slightly higher than the observed ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . Transitivity was slightly 345 higher for the reconstructed network with observation bias than without , but lower than the 346 observed network in any case ( Figure 3c ) , as expected since the algorithm did not take into 347 account any element of transitivity when constructing synthetic networks . Finally , 348 assortativity by degree and by ward , as well as temporal correlation , were all well preserved 349 in the reconstructed networks ( Figure 3d - f ) . As a comparison , the random networks with or 350 without bias either substantially over - or under - estimated the values for all metrics compared 351 to the observed network ( Figure 3a - f ) , although we note that transitivity was similar to the 352 other synthetic networks ( Figure 3c ) . 353 354 .

The reconstructed networks with 356 observation bias exclude individuals from the network at times when they were known to not 357 wear their sensors . The random networks did not take into account the ward - level structure 358 of the contacts or the probability of recurring contacts . Boxplots for the observed network 359 show the distribution of values calculated for each day . Boxplots for all reconstructed and 360 random networks show the distribution of the median values calculated for each day across 361 100 networks . 362 363 The hourly distributions of numbers of unique patient - patient , staff - patient and staff - staff 364 contacts in the reconstructed network with bias align with those in the observed network 365 ( Figure 4a ) . Whilst these two networks are only partially observed since individuals in the i - 366 Bird study did not have contacts recorded during all their presence days , those unobserved 367 contacts are present in the reconstructed network without bias , leading to approximately 368 twice as many contacts in that network ( Figure 4a ) . Similarly , the random network without 369 bias which is only informed by the hourly distribution of patient - patient , staff - staff and 370 patient - staff contact rates is aligned with the reconstructed network ( Figure 4a ) . 371 372 .

This is because all networks sample their contact durations from a lognormal distribution 375 parameterised by the mean and variance estimated from the data , which puts less emphasis 376 on very short contacts of less than one minute ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . 377 378 379 Figure 4 : Comparison of network contact number and duration . a ) Distribution of number 380 of unique contacts per hour , separated by type of day ( weekday or weekend ) .

The variability across reconstructed networks was not 388 statistically significant for any metric ( Kruskal - Wallis test , p value > 0 . 05 ) except for 389 assortativity by degree ( p < 0 . 001 ) .

These re - simulated networks are similar to the full reconstructed 392 networks , indicating that our algorithm consistently recreates realistic networks and 393 reconstructs unobserved contacts ( Supplementary Figure 7 ) . However , the number of patient - 394 patient contacts in the re - simulated networks is slightly higher than in the reconstructed 395 networks ( Supplementary Figure 7 ) . 396 .

To test our algorithm , we used 28 days of CPI 400 data from the i - Bird study , which recorded contacts of staff and patients in a long - term care 401 facility . The observed i - Bird network was heterogeneous , with notably a strong assortativity 402 by ward , varying contact rates between different staff categories and patients , and different 403 contact structures on weekends compared to weekdays . Importantly , we observed temporal 404 correlation between subsequent days in the network , and we estimated that individuals were 405 generally more likely to have contacts with other individuals they previously met rather than 406 new individuals . We therefore informed our reconstruction algorithm with both contact rates 407 by hour , type of day ( weekday or weekend ) and staff category , and probabilities of recurring 408 contacts estimated for patients and staff using the i - Bird data . The resulting reconstructed 409 networks reproduced well the characteristics of the observed network , as well as the specific 410 distribution of unique contacts per hour . 411 412 Similarities between the observed and reconstructed networks 413 The i - Bird contact network was only partially observed , since contact data was missing on 414 average for 37 % of each patient’s presence days ( 42 % for staff ) . This could have occurred for 415 a number of reasons which we cannot distinguish , including depleted batteries , sensor 416 malfunction , or imperfect sensor - wearing compliance . However , since the average contact 417 rates of individuals did not correlate with the proportion of their presence time during which 418 no contact data were recorded ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) , it can be assumed that contact 419 patterns on unobserved days were similar to those on observed days . With that assumption , 420 we were able to reconstruct contacts at those times when individuals were present but had 421 no reported contact data . The resulting full reconstructed network is a valuable 422 representation of individual interactions , as it represents the “true” contact network , 423 compared to the i - Bird empirical network which was only partially observed . Although we 424 were inherently limited in our ability to validate this network since the real , fully observed 425 network was not available , we compared it to a re - simulated network which used the 426 .

The reconstructed and re - simulated 427 networks without bias were almost identical with regards to all the network metrics we 428 considered ( Supplementary Figure 7 ) , demonstrating the consistency of our algorithm to 429 reconstruct contacts . 430 431 To generate a reconstructed network directly comparable to the observed i - Bird data , we 432 included an observation process to only simulate contacts for individuals at hours when they 433 had contact data reported . This reconstructed network with bias and the observed network 434 had similar positive assortativity by ward , as expected since the input data captured the 435 contact structure by ward . The negative assortativity by degree was also similar , however we 436 noted variability between different networks generated independently by the algorithm 437 ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . Since the algorithm did not directly account for assortativity when 438 simulating networks , this similarity stems from our use of a recurring contact probability 439 coupled with the contact rates estimated by staff categories , resulting in a non - random 440 contact structure with regards to this metric . The hourly contact distribution of patient - 441 patient , staff - staff , and patient - staff contacts was also successfully reproduced by our 442 algorithm . 443 444 A key metric of interest here is temporal correlation , which indicates how conserved the 445 network structure is over time . This type of metric is useful to determine the efficiency of 446 disease spread across temporal networks over time [ 29 , 30 ] . Since our algorithm took into 447 consideration the probability of recurring contacts between individuals , our reconstructed 448 networks displayed similar temporal correlation as observed , whilst random networks 449 substantially underestimated this . This aspect is therefore an important strength of our 450 approach , compared to only using estimated average contact rates to construct synthetic 451 contacts . 452 453 Limitations of the algorithm 454 Density and global efficiency in the reconstructed network with bias were slightly higher than 455 in the observed network . This is a likely consequence of our observation process which forcibly 456 removed individuals from the network at times when they had no contacts recorded , hence 457 .

Simultaneously , there was still a need 458 at those times to generate some novel contacts between individuals who never previously 459 met , since the probability of recurring contacts was less than 1 . Combined , these elements 460 increased the overall connectivity amongst all individuals in the reconstructed network with 461 bias . Although this could facilitate disease transmission across these reconstructed networks 462 if they are used for such purpose [ 31 ] , the high assortativity by ward may counter this effect 463 by slowing down transmission across the entire healthcare facility . 464 465 Our algorithm did not specifically account for transitivity when recreating contacts . This is 466 likely why the resulting transitivity was similar to that of the random network and 467 underestimated the observed value ( Figure 3 ) . Similarly to density and global efficiency 468 mentioned above , any transitivity in the reconstructed network was likely an indirect 469 consequence of assortativity by ward , restricting the pool of available individuals to generate 470 contacts and leading to interconnectivity between individuals present in the same ward . In 471 any case , this may not substantially affect disease transmission simulated across these 472 networks , since previous work has shown that transitivity is a poor predictor of the total 473 number of individuals who would be infected across the network [ 31 ] . Whilst we could extend 474 our algorithm to consider transitivity when choosing the individuals to put in contact , we 475 decided not to do this here to maximise the generalisability of our approach by not requiring 476 such highly detailed contact data . 477 478 Information about patient temporary releases from the hospital ( e . g . , for weekends with their 479 families ) was not available in the i - Bird data , hence such events were not accounted for here , 480 although they may occur frequently in a LTCF . Consequently , the duration of hospital stays 481 may have been overestimated , leading to an overestimation of some contacts among 482 patients . Although this is negligible when comparing the observed and reconstructed network 483 with bias , this is likely why the re - simulated networks slightly overestimated the number of 484 patient - patient contacts compared to the full reconstructed network ( Supplementary Figure 485 7 ) . We expect that this overestimation would be absent in settings with more complete 486 information on individual presence , such as schools , workplaces , or acute care facilities . 487 488 Future work 489 .

However , contact structures are known to vary depending on the 491 setting investigated , even between different healthcare settings such as long - term or acute . 492 In addition , even though we had substantial data covering four weeks , it’s unclear how 493 representative this contact structure is for other time periods . Notably , our study period falls 494 in the middle of the summer , which is a holiday period in France and may have affected 495 contact patterns . A first important next step would therefore be to repeat this analysis using 496 data collected in a different setting such as acute care , over a different time period . Although 497 we do not expect that our algorithm will perform differently , the strengths and limitations we 498 have highlighted above may be more or less relevant in these different settings . For example , 499 in a setting with low transitivity , the fact that our algorithm underestimates this metric would 500 be less problematic . 501 502 Here we directly re - used patient admission and discharge data as well as staff schedules to 503 identify which individuals were present in the facility at each hour , and hence whom the 504 algorithm had to build contacts for . While this choice was coherent since our aim was to 505 compare the observed and reconstructed networks , a second possible extension of our work 506 would be to simulate the presence of individuals over time . This could be implemented by 507 extracting admission and discharge rates for each category of staff and patients and using 508 these values to recreate new presence times for individuals by sampling from relevant 509 probability distributions . This would allow us to further account for possible variability in the 510 structure of the population in the facility , and hence add further stochasticity in our algorithm . 511 512 Since contact data may only be available for short periods of time , a third question of interest 513 would be to understand the volume of data required to generate realistic temporal contact 514 networks using our algorithm . In our main analysis , we used the entire four weeks available 515 to both derive contact parameters and compare the reconstructed and observed networks . 516 For sensitivity , we also considered smaller timer periods to calculate the summary contact 517 parameters required by the algorithm ( Supplementary Figure 8 ) . As expected , this led to 518 variability amongst the reconstructed networks depending on the length of the period used . 519 In any case , the main risk of using only a short period of time is to miss out some contacts 520 between categories . For example , during a single week , by chance there may not be any 521 .

In that 523 case , the algorithm will systematically assume that such contacts never occur during the entire 524 period over which the reconstructed networks are generated and will therefore construct an 525 incomplete network . Therefore , it is essential for users to be confident that the data they use 526 include contact rates for all relevant categories in their setting and for typical representative 527 days . 528 529 As discussed above , taking into account the probability for contacts to be recurring instead of 530 assuming a uniform distribution is a key element of our approach . Here , we estimate the 531 average probabilities of recurring contacts as 0 . 71 for staff and 0 . 78 for patients , but we note 532 some individual variation in this value ( Figure 2 ) . In addition , our estimation here is made using 533 the entire observed contact networks , but this may be difficult in instances where only limited 534 data are available . For sensitivity , we investigated the impact of manually setting the 535 probabilities to 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 and 0 . 9 for both staff and patients ( Supplementary Figure 9 ) . This led 536 to important variations in assortativity by degree and temporal correlation compared to using 537 the estimated probability . A greater understanding of this recurring contact probability in 538 various settings would be helpful to improve the generalisability of our algorithm and will also 539 be useful more broadly to better understand contact heterogeneity . In healthcare settings , 540 this probability could likely be estimated without requiring complete contact data , using 541 information on staff schedules and patient ward allocation instead . 542 543 Deep learning algorithms such as graph convolutional networks ( GCN ) have become 544 increasingly popular to study contact networks , particularly in the context of infectious 545 disease transmission [ 32 – 36 ] . It would be interesting to compare the performance of these 546 approaches with our algorithm to estimate network characteristics and reconstruct 547 unobserved contacts . However , traditional GCN approaches do not account for temporal 548 dependencies between contacts such as the ones we observed in the i - Bird network where 549 the probability of recurring contacts plays a key role [ 37 , 38 ] . On the other hand , temporal 550 graph networks can capture this temporal dependency [ 39 , 40 ] , but require substantial 551 computational resources to be applied to a network such as i - Bird , with hundreds of 552 interactions recorded every 30 seconds during several weeks . Finally , deep learning methods 553 .

Democratising their use would therefore first require 554 new studies to collect close - proximity interaction data in different settings and time periods , 555 presenting further logistical challenges . 556 557 Implications 558 Our algorithm relied on computing summary statistics from an observed network , then using 559 these statistics to stochastically reconstruct contact networks . Such statistics could be derived 560 directly from other observed networks , as we have done here to validate our approach . In 561 that case , our approach to generate multiple reconstructed networks could be useful to 562 evaluate the impact of stochasticity on the contact structure in a given setting , instead of only 563 relying on a single observed network . Our approach could also be used to infer information 564 on potentially unobserved contacts and to predict realistic temporal dynamics over longer 565 time periods than the data collection . 566 567 Alternatively , summary contact statistics could be more simply collected from cross - sectional 568 surveys or even derived exclusively from individual schedules , which would not require a 569 detailed and costly follow - up using sensors . In this scenario , the only other data required 570 would be individual presence times , which should either be routinely available ( e . g . in 571 healthcare settings or schools ) or relatively easy to collect ( e . g . in workplaces ) . Although as 572 mentioned in the Limitations the amount of data our algorithm requires to generate realistic 573 networks is still unclear , our approach could ultimately be used to generate contact networks 574 from contact matrices . This would substantially facilitate research on the impact of contact 575 heterogeneity in various populations and settings . 576 577 To the best of our knowledge , this is the first proposed algorithm to generate temporal contact 578 networks by taking into consideration empirically measured contact rates based on close - 579 proximity sensors , while most available packages only construct static networks and rely on 580 hyperparameters [ 41 ] . These temporal networks could then be used within mathematical 581 models used to evaluate the potential impact of interventions against disease transmission 582 networks [ 9 – 12 ] . In particular , this could improve the wider applicability of individual - based 583 .
