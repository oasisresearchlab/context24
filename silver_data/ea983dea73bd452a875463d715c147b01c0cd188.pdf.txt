The adapted WHO Unity FFX protocol for COVID - 19 was implemented to gain an understanding of the clinical , epidemiological , virological , and household transmission dynamics of the ﬁrst cases of COVID - 19 infection detected in Juba , South Sudan . Methods Laboratory - conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases were identiﬁed through the national surveillance system , and an initial visit was conducted with eligible cases to identify all close contacts . Consenting cases and close contacts were enrolled between June 2020 and December 2020 . Demographic , clinical information and biological samples were taken at enrolment and 14 – 21 days post - enrolment for all participants . Results Twenty - nine primary cases and 82 contacts were included in analyses . Most primary cases ( n = 23 / 29 , 79 . 3 % ) and contacts ( n = 61 / 82 , 74 . 4 % ) were male . Many primary cases ( n = 18 / 29 , 62 . 1 % ) and contacts ( n = 51 / 82 , 62 . 2 % ) were seropositive for SARS - CoV - 2 at baseline . The secondary attack rate among susceptible contacts was 12 . 9 % ( 4 / 31 ; 95 % CI : 4 . 9 % – 29 . 7 % ) . All secondary cases and most ( 72 % ) primary cases were asymptomatic . Reported symptoms included coughing ( n = 6 / 29 , 20 . 7 % ) , fever or history of fever ( n = 4 / 29 , 13 . 8 % ) , headache ( n = 3 / 29 , 10 . 3 % ) and shortness of breath ( n = 3 / 29 , 10 . 3 % ) . Of 38 cases , two were hospitalised ( 5 . 3 % ) and one died ( 2 . 6 % ) . Conclusions These ﬁndings were used to develop the South Sudanese Ministry of Health surveillance and contract tracing protocols , informing local COVID - 19 case deﬁnitions , follow - up protocols and data management systems . This investigation demonstrates that rapid FFX implementation is critical in understanding the emerging disease and informing response priorities .
