While technological and human capabilities are all necessary for an effective KMS , much focus has been put on the technological than non - technological aspects of Knowledge Management ( KM ) . Technology positively enhances knowledge development but can also make skills obsolete . This study investigates the extent to which non - technological aspects of KM have been integrated in a KMS of a financial service organization and the impact of this integration on the KMS effectiveness . 90 employees participated in a case study and qualitative and quantitative data analysis was conducted . The results show that employee skills were not leveraged to guide customers , service offerings were below standards , operations were inflexible and idea generation and diffusion were limited . Correlation and regression tests confirmed that non - technological factors influence the KMS effectiveness . Keywords—knowledge management , technological aspects , non - technological aspects I . I NTRODUCTION Organisations are increasingly relying on Knowledge for competitive advantage and many have adopted knowledge management ( KM ) as a practice . While there has been much focus on technology as driver of Knowledge , many of the great knowledge concepts like , Starbucks customer experience , Amazon customer convenience and the Cique du Soleil concept had very little to do with technology and more focused on offering value to the customer [ 1 ] . This value is achieved through the realisation of the non - technological aspects of knowledge . The financial service industry is one of the fastest changing industries in the world . With pressure from shareholders to constantly improve bottom line , new companies entering into the market and challenging customers demanding faster response to their needs , financial service institutions require innovative personnel and knowledge systems to do business [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . However many Knowledge Management Systems ( KMS ) focus on the technological aspects . Non - technological aspects of KM such as culture , employee capabilities and training are often ignored . Limited research has been conducted to examine this problem in the financial sector . One financial institution , the subject of the present study has migrated to a new knowledge management system . The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which important non - technological aspects of KM have been integrated into this new Knowledge Management System ( KMS ) . This paper starts with a brief overview of the organization , then the literature review discussing various topics pertaining to knowledge and KM within the Financial Service Industry . There after the researchers present a research Model to guide this study and the research methodology adopted . The findings of this research are presented , analysed and conclusions drawn . II . O RGANIZATIONAL B ACKGROUND The research is a case study within a Financial Service Organization . The Organization has approximately 1500 employees and is located in South Africa . The organisation has been in operation since 1995 and sells a host of financial products such as : Short Term Loans , Secured Loans , Life Insurance , Short Term Insurance and Medical Aid . This organization is referred to in this study as X to ensure Page 1087 978 - 1 - 4799 - 4437 - 8 / 14 / $ 31 . 00 ©2014 IEEE 03 - 06 December 2014 , Dubai , UAE 2014 International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning ( ICL ) anonymity . Organization X recently implemented a KMS however it appears that the system is not operating effectively . Technical managers have realised that employees are reverting to manual processes and are despondent towards the technical system . There also appears to be a feeling that non - technological aspects of knowledge management , which in the past sustained the organisation , have been ignored . Hence the researchers set out to determine the extent of the integration into the KMS of non - technological aspects of KM . The following section reviews the literature and a research model is developed to guide this study . III . L ITERATURE REVIEW With the movement towards knowledge intensive organisations in the early 21st century , knowledge became the focus of many organizations [ 4 ] . Knowledge can be in Tacit or Explicit form . Tacit knowledge is what the knower knows , which is derived from experience and embodies beliefs and values [ 5 ] . Explicit knowledge is that knowledge held formally in the form of reports , equations , formulae and specifications and can be easily transmitted between individuals and teams . As organisations continue to experience business challenges , it has become imperative to manage their knowledge assets and activities . Abbreviations and Acronyms A . Knowledge Management KM activities are generally considered to involve the following tasks : composition of ideas ; searching ; acquisition / aggregation ; processing ; classification ; reviewing ; storing and sharing [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] . According to Nonaka [ 5 ] knowledge can be created through conversion of knowledge from tacit form to explicit form . It can also be created through greater social interaction through networks ( e . g . the ontological dimension ) . This is important for financial organisations where pockets of ideas , duplication and ineffective knowledge development have been reported [ 3 ] . Nonaka [ 5 ] states further that knowledge creation requires continuous commitment , autonomy , interaction with the external environment and feedback . Furthermore , the process of knowledge creation is challenging in that it also has many ethical and legal implications more especially where technology is involved . Knowledge management motivations and behaviours are intertwined with power relations , and self - interests of actors which result in unethical behaviours [ 7 ] . These unethical practices appear to be escalated by the widespread adoption of information technology . Land et al . [ 7 ] indeed cite several practical examples of fraudulent practices committed by those responsible for knowledge management with the aid of technology . Floridi [ 8 ] argues that evil and immoral behaviors may arise in the process of processing information or as a result of information deficiency . These relate to availability , accessibility , accuracy , accountability , plagiarism , privacy , and abuse of intellectual property . Other stages in the knowledge development circle involve effective diffusion and storage . Many barriers have been identified in the process of dissemination of knowledge [ 9 ] . These call for an effective Knowledge Management System . B . Knowledge Management Systems ( KMS ) A KMS facilitates the creation of knowledge and therefore consists of various KM initiatives , capabilities , tools and processes identified above . Some of these may be supported by technology while others not . Alavi and Leidner [ 10 ] argue that KMS are multi - faceted and that effective KMS involve far more than just technology as they encompass broad cultural and organisational issues . KMS therefore consists of both technological and non - technological aspects [ 11 ] . Most of the criticism surrounding KMS has been regarding the strong focus on technological aspects and lack of focus on the human and cultural aspects [ 12 ] , [ 1 ] . Researchers argue that innovation highlights the iterative character of innovation processes where non - technological aspects play a crucial role in getting the most of firms’ capacity for technological innovation [ 13 ] . The rapid changes and discontinuities in technologies or shift in the environment introduce new ways of working which could undermine the usefulness of embedded knowledge . Prahalad [ 14 ] therefore argues that competencies need to be developed rapidly and continuously to take advantage of new opportunities otherwise such discontinuities in technologies may change these competencies into rigidities . Stone [ 15 ] shows how the new technology can lead to deskilling . Following the above discussion , we define a KMS in the present study as that system conducting KM initiatives that are technologically and non - technologically based , designed to give decision makers the knowledge they need to make decisions and perform their tasks . In the following section we examine some technological and non - technological aspects of KM found in a KMS . C . Technological aspects of KM Technological aspects of KM include those KM initiatives or practices that are aided by technology . For instance there are KM initiatives to facilitate online learning , e . g . via the internet . Digital repositories host a plethora of existing knowledge which can be shared within the organization [ 16 ] . Technologies support knowledge gathering and knowledge storage . Functionality such as indexing , file formatting and Web 2 . 0 tools in general enhance the competencies of the users in retrieving , disseminating or externalizing knowledge . D . Non - technological aspects of KM Non - technological aspects of KM encompass those KM activities , initiatives or practices that are not driven by technology . There has been much debate about these initiatives and their output . Moore [ 17 ] argues these may result in various types of innovation : disruptive , application , experiential innovation , product leadership , customer intimacy , and operation excellence . Hollanders and Cruysen [ 18 ] state that they may include innovation outputs like intellectual property and outputs entrepreneurship . Most common cited examples are informal socialisation and Page 1088 978 - 1 - 4799 - 4437 - 8 / 14 / $ 31 . 00 ©2014 IEEE 03 - 06 December 2014 , Dubai , UAE 2014 International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning ( ICL ) brainstorming often developed without the aid of technology . Informal socialization between individuals leads to the development of personal relationships and new knowledge [ 19 ] . Strong socialisation with suppliers and customers enables the organizations to leverage the shared tacit knowledge to achieve competitive advantage [ 19 ] . Brainstorming sessions are also used to identify good ideas that lead to the development of new products and services . This study will focus mainly on the non - technological practices and some of those relevant to the financial service industry are discussed below [ 20 ] . 3 . 4 . 1 . Employee guidance of customers - Through differentiating themselves , service organisations are able to increase sales by retaining existing customers and recruiting new ones [ 20 ] . In an attempt to connect with customers , banks resort to clever marketing like : " We ' re a people ' s bank ; We care about you ; We ' re friendly " . Service differentiation is a challenging task within the financial service sector [ 21 ] . Firms need to comply with regulations , manage fraud ; and still offer the customer a personalized experience . Financial Institutions are thus reliant on the skills of their employees to differentiate them from their competitors [ 20 ] . An important skill required for employees is the ability to guide customers on making intelligent financial decisions [ 20 ] . 3 . 4 . 2 . Service offerings ( defining the type of customer / segmenting customers ) - Customisation involves developing the goods or services to satisfy the specific needs of the customer . To most clients bank product offerings are the same therefore banks would attempt to differentiate themselves through product and service offerings [ 20 ] . Two non - technological KM activities facilitating service offerings are : ability to define the customer and ability to segment customers . By identifying the characteristics of the customer , the organization is able to focus product offerings , market spend and service offerings . Once the customers are identified , they can then segment them based on similar characteristics [ 20 ] . Segmentation can be used to identify specific product or service offerings for different segments or to prioritise certain customers [ 20 ] . 3 . 4 . 3 . Culture ( A culture that encourages idea generation and idea diffusion ) - Culture has an impact on the degree of creativity and knowledge generated by an organization [ 22 ] . It uniforms the values , beliefs , rules , behaviour and norms of the organization [ 22 ] . An innovative culture introduces new changes to the practices and relationships [ 1 ] . Direct mail , internet and mobile marketing all leverage technology but the ideas are generated by individuals [ 23 ] . Idea generation is one non - technological aspects of KM and related to this is the ability to diffuse the ideas into actionable steps . Financial executives have observed that innovation happens within pockets across the organization and often the challenge is how to pull these together [ 3 ] , [ 23 ] . Based on the literature review above , the researchers developed a conceptual model below . Research Model As has been revealed in the literature review , employee competencies are a crucial component of an effective Knowledge Management system [ 10 ] . Employees can guide customers on making appropriate financial decisions and the effectiveness of such guidance may depend on their role , skills or abilities [ 20 ] . In addition , while firms provide similar product offerings , those that differentiate their services remain competitive [ 20 ] . Defining customers more strategically and ensuring proper customer segmentation opens up cross sell and increases sell opportunities . Also the successful implementation of a knowledge management system is determined by the extent the organizational culture is conducive to the collection and sharing of knowledge [ 10 ] . A conceptual model is presented below ( see Fig . 1 ) to guide the present study . In the model we argue that an effective KMS will consist of non - technological KM practices like proper guidance of customers by employees ; proper definition and segmentation of customers ( service offering ) and a culture of idea generation and diffusion . Therefore the extent to which these aspects are integrated in the KMS will contribute to its effectiveness . Fig . 1 . Research model We therefore hypothesize that : H1 : Proper guidance of customers by employees will significantly contribute to the effectiveness of the KMS H2 : Proper definition and segmentation of customers will significantly contribute to the effectiveness of the KMS H3 : A culture of idea generation and diffusion will significantly contribute to the effectiveness of the KMS These hypotheses were tested and the findings from the tests are discussed in the following section . IV . M ETHODOLOGY A single case study was conducted to investigate the extent to which non - technological aspects of knowledge are integrated into the Knowledge Management System of a Financial Service Organization . Mixed methods were adopted to collect and analyse the data . Data was captured using a questionnaire which was divided into five sections TABLE I . D ESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS Page 1089 978 - 1 - 4799 - 4437 - 8 / 14 / $ 31 . 00 ©2014 IEEE 03 - 06 December 2014 , Dubai , UAE 2014 International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning ( ICL ) namely ; demographical information , service differentiation , service offerings , culture and effectiveness of the KMS . The demographic section collected information such as length of service , role , employment type , department and technology experience . The section on employee competencies and service differentiation assessed the employee’s ability to guide the customer in making the appropriate financial decisions . The section on service offering assessed the employee’s understanding of customers and ability to segment them . The following section evaluated cultural aspects ( i . e . , the extent of idea generation and diffusion ) . The last section measured the effectiveness of the KMS . The effectiveness of a KMS may be measured in terms of product and service quality , productivity , innovative ability , customer / employee satisfaction , sharing of knowledge , return on investment or a combination of measures . In the present study a combination of measures were used e . g . the frequency of generating and implementing ideas ( non - technological ) , the effectiveness of the IT system used ( technological ) , and quality of service to customers ( competencies in handling customer queries ) . There were also four open questions ( A , B , C and D ) . Question A asked respondents about their market segment , Question B was about customer prioritization , Question C determined their understanding of the idea generation process and Question D determined how proactive they were in handling customers . The organization consists of approximately 1500 employees . A sample of 300 was selected using stratified sampling techniques . The researchers ensured that people playing the following key roles were involved ( i . e . , managers , team leaders , agents and specialists ) . A letter was sent to these participants requesting for their participation . V . F INDINGS AND DATA ANALYSIS A . Demographic Data 90 responses from 15 departments in total were obtained of which 11 were managers , 11 team leaders , 46 agents and 22 specialists . 20 % of the respondents were in employment for up to 1 year , 21 % for more than 1 year but less than 2 years , 27 % for 2 years but less than 5 years , and 18 % were employed for 5 years and above . Further statistical analysis was conducted and the results are represented in Table I . The constructs were measured on a Likert scale of 1 = lowest ( e . g . strongly disagree ) to 5 = highest ( strongly agree ) . The results in Table 1 suggest that employees possess competencies in a number of areas ( SD3 , SD4 , SD5 , SD8 , SD9 , SD12 and SD13 ) . However they still have to develop competencies in understanding competitor offerings ( SD6 ) , use screen guides ( SD10 ) and handling contract objections on the IT system ( SD11 ) . Spearman correlation analysis also confirmed close association between most measured variables . We therefore averaged the measures of each Employee Competencies N Mean Sd .

These average results indicate that while respondents agree that they possess most of the competencies measured , they did not agree firmly that they had abilities to define / segment customers ( service offering ) and also develop a culture of knowledge generation and diffusion ( the average results are just below 4 . 00 ) . Of the three independent factors , culture development scored the lowest . The KMS is generally perceived to be ineffective ( average , i . e . , AVEff is 2 . 45 which represents disagree ) . VI . D ISCUSSION OF RESULTS AND HYPOTHESIS The analysis of mean responses by role shows that managers , team leaders , agents and specialists agreed to a greater extent that they possess various skills in guiding customers although there is lack of competencies in SD6 , SD10 , and SD11 ( see Table I above ) . The qualitative results obtained through a thematic analysis also confirm this observation . When asked how proactive they were in engaging customers ( Question D ) , there were clearly positive and negative responses as shown in Table II below . TABLE II . POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE COMMENTS REGARDING ENGAGEMENT WITH CUSTOMERS Some of these responses clearly indicate that a number of activities are afterthoughts as the organisation appears to be more reactive than proactive . The comments also show the risks in their operations and knowledge management practices which could have ethical and legal implications . For instance too much unsolicited documentation sent out to customers and the many calls made which customers find irritating . There is therefore evidence of competencies but not in all the measured areas . We conducted a t - test to determine if employee competencies in guiding customers are influenced by the role in the organisation . We found that this is only true where sufficient training is provided on technical and products at the start of the role ( SD1 ) , sufficient training is provided on handling customer objections ( SD2 ) and where quality information is provided on the employee’s IT system ( SD13 ) . Therefore roles that developed competencies in technical , product and use of quality IT information would provide better guide to customers than others . However competencies in many other areas do not appear to differ by role . H1 : Proper guidance of customers will significantly contribute to the effectiveness of the KMS . In order to test this hypothesis , we run a regression analysis to measure the impact of the independent variables ( employee competencies , service offering and culture ) , on the dependent variable ( effectiveness of the KMS ) . The contribution of Competencies on the effectiveness of KMS is positive ( 0 . 319 ) and significant ( see Table III ) . Hypothesis1 is therefore supported . TABLE III .

Respondents do not seem to agree to a greater extent that employees have the ability to define and segment customers . The only service offering competencies they possess include understanding of the organisation’s customers ( SO20 ) , understanding why a customer may be declined for a service ( SO21 ) , and ability to explain to a customer why he / she is down sold ( SO22 ) . The responses to the question ( SO24 ) that measured whether customer can be segmented based on quality suggest a weak agreement ( 3 . 69 is below 4 . 00 which represents agree ) . When asked in which market segment their organisation was found ( see Question A in Table IV below ) , the following responses were obtained : TABLE IV . RESPONSES ON SEGMENTATION AND PRIORITISATION Question A - Explain in your own opinion which market segment Organisation X is found ? Question B - Explain how customers are prioritised and how the system facilitates this I do not know / N / A I don’t know , cannot comment and N / A Middle to low market / class Prioritised from Newest to oldest Positive Comments Negative comments We take costly risks to meet customer needs No , we are reactive Always assist customers with their needs But agents need to be trained Send reminders to customers We could be more proactive in regards to when we approach a customer Live up to our brand promises With all the information we have on the customer we could be more proactive especially with our repeating customers Return customer calls promptly Too much documentation and calls are made to customers which sometimes irritates them Save the customer the time to queue in the bank There is room for improvement . Department X and contract staff should get more sales training Offer critical advice No , customers need to confirm all the details and the system is not user friendly Our process is fast and efficient So many agents on the floor – some are very proactive , others less so Listen to customer queries and improve Sometimes customers are not engaged consistently across all agents and areas No , our consultants are not able to answer our customers’ queries efficiently Page 1091 978 - 1 - 4799 - 4437 - 8 / 14 / $ 31 . 00 ©2014 IEEE 03 - 06 December 2014 , Dubai , UAE 2014 International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning ( ICL ) Finance Prioritised oldest to Newest Mailing Prioritised by customer history Direct lending By personal information ( salaries / expenses ) Mailing , internet , SMS , calls By risk grades ; Cross sells upsells secured loan Customer that need faster services By risk grades Market to all Cross sells upsells secured loan Above average The system does not facilitate customer prioritisation Again this level of mixed responses to Question A suggests inability to define the segment precisely . When also asked how customers are prioritised and how the system facilitates the prioritisations ( Question B ) , again there were many different ways suggested which indicates lack of a clear strategy on prioritisation . One respondent clearly stated that “… this is an area that needs to be improved on within our department” . Therefore some respondents agreed while others did not agree that abilities to define / identify , segment and prioritize customers properly are possessed . There are other comments about service offerings in general which suggests some lack of flexibility in operation and failure to consider the changing dynamics of the business ( See Table V below ) . These comments again show the challenges resulting from over - dependency on the IT system for knowledge management : e . g . difficulty working with IT archived information ; lack of access to information due to IT system unavailability ; system back log causing delays ; failure of the IT systems to support investigations [ 9 ] , [ 8 ] . It also suggests lack of contingency planning for possible occurrence of IT failures . TABLE V . ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON SERVICE OFFERING We also conducted a t - test to determine whether ability to define and segment customers differ by role . There were no significant results suggesting that employee role does not have a significant effect on ability to define and segment customers . H2 : Proper definition and segmentation of customers ( Service Offering ) will significantly contribute to the effectiveness of the KMS Regression analysis results ( see Table III above ) show that measures of service offerings positively and significantly influence the effectiveness of the KMS . Therefore Hypothesis2 is supported . There exists a significant relationship between service offering and effectiveness of the KMS . Table I also indicates that measures of Culture have low scores . Responds feel to a very limited extent that they are encouraged to be innovative and to think of new ways to improve services ( see C30 ( 3 . 97 ) and C31 ( 3 . 73 ) are just below 4 . 00 , which represents agree ) . The questions determined the organizations ability to encourage idea generation and diffusion of ideas . Employees do not agree that idea generation and diffusion have been properly developed or integrated in the organisation’s KMS . They did not agree with Questions C33 while their agreement with C34 was also very weak ( 3 . 53 ) . Respondents were also asked if they understood the process to follow when they had innovative ideas ( Question C – do you understand what process to follow if you had an innovative idea ? ) . 60 % of the respondents did not know the process . Those who knew could only explain the steps up to the point where the idea is shared with the immediate manager ( see Table VI below ) . Some employees who generate ideas do not appear to receive feedback on their innovation . TABLE VI . RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS ON UNDERSTANDING OF THE INNOVATIVE PROCESS N / A ; No , I do not have an explanation on the process No comment No , one doesn’t always feel that your idea is taken into account . Or if it is used . Shared with your immediate line manager I only know to speak to my manager . It’s important to first investigate your facts , prove that your idea can result good productivity and then advise managers . The qualitative results also confirm that there is consensus that no formal process is in place for dissemination of ideas . Agents appear not to be engaged in idea generation and are not aware of the idea generation processes . This highlights the challenge the organisation is facing as agents who are normally in direct contact with the clients are not involved in generating ideas . The level of idea generation and diffusion is this organization was therefore found to be low . Earlier studies have emphasised that employees are a key source of idea generation since they interact with the customers on a daily basis and feedback 1 Currently the system does not facilitate customer prioritisation , and a manual process has been implemented to cater for this ( contact ability point of view ) . 2 Yes it does , but also find it difficult with archived information 3 The IT system is our only information system but gives us lots of problems , I think a new system is needed 4 Sometimes we have to depend on the IT system operators ] to assist and when they have a back log we have to wait on them . If we had access we would be able to perform certain functions . 5 no , the credit screen was taken away from Department Y giving us very little to work with 6 [ The IT system ] does provide lot of information , but not enough to do investigations . Other supporting systems will then be required 7 So many agents on the floor so this varies – some are very pro - active , others less so 8 No , our consultants are not able to answer our customers’ queries efficiently . 9 With the current technology yes but from an online perspective we have a lot of work to do 10 The firm needs accommodate customers’ needs and requests Page 1092 978 - 1 - 4799 - 4437 - 8 / 14 / $ 31 . 00 ©2014 IEEE 03 - 06 December 2014 , Dubai , UAE 2014 International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning ( ICL ) need to be provided to those generating the ideas [ 22 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 23 ] . We conducted a t - test to determine whether the roles of the respondent have significant influence on their ability to generate and diffuse ideas ( see Table VII below ) . TABLE VII .

Therefore the perceived ineffectiveness of the KMS can be attributed mainly by the lack of a strong culture of idea generation and diffusion . The qualitative results above indicated that many felt there was lack of clear procedures for idea generation and dissemination and some of those that generated ideas were not provided with feedback on their innovation . H3 is therefore supported . VII . CONCLUSION This study investigated the extent to which non - technological aspects of KM ( e . g . Employee guidance of customers , Service Offerings and development of an innovative culture ) have been integrated in a knowledge management system of a financial service organization and the impact of this integration on the KMS effectiveness . The results show limited integration of non - technological aspects in the KMS . Cultural aspects ( i . e . ability to encourage idea generation and diffusion ) in particular contribute the most to the effectiveness of the KMS . Idea generation and dissemination were found to be lacking in organisation X . Idea generation and diffusion need to be encouraged . Respondents also felt that some of the skills of the employees were not leveraged to guide customers and service offerings were not up to the expected standards . Also respondents felt that where some of these aspects were considered , this was as afterthoughts . Consequently , the KMS was perceived to be ineffective . The implications of our findings for financial institutions and KMS developers are that while IT is necessary , it is important to envision KMS not only in terms of IT requirements but also its non - technological aspects as these ensure the KMS effectiveness and can diminish potential risks in knowledge management resulting from adopting IT . The conceptual model developed in this study can be used by institutions to test the effectiveness of their KMS . REFERENCES [ 1 ] Villa , J . , and MacGregor , S .
