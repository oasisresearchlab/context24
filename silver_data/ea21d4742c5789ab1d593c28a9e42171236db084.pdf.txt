Burkhardt 1 Accepted December 8 , 1997 ; revised January 16 , 1998 This study investigates individual flexibility of foraging ants ( Pheidole dentata ) when the number ofnestmates is altered by establishing broodless and queenless colony fragments all originating from a single big colony . Scouts from small groups ( 5 to 15 ants ) behave like solitary foragers . They feed for long periods of time , they return slowly into the nest , and they recruit weakly . The ingested food is distributed by trophallaxis . Scouts from larger ( 20 - to 30 - ant ) fragments forage more socially . Feeding and return times are short and recruitment is strong . Later the food is always transported into the nest . Two alternative mechanisms are discussed to explain the differences in individual foraging behavior . For the first—individual flexibility—assumptions have to be made about the capabilities of the individual , its work repertoire , and decision making outside the nest . The second mechanism takes into account that ants are capable of perceiving CO - 2 concentration differences and that ant groups are more active at higher CO 2 concentrations . The organizational differences at the group level are explained simply by tempo differences in individual ants without making assumptions about individual capabilities . INTRODUCTION Ant colonies adapt to varying external influences such as food abundance or competitors by changing basic strategies ( e . g . , Bernstein , 1975 ; Wilson , 1976a ; Davidson , 1977 ) . Behavioral flexibility of individuals as well as age and caste polyethism enables a colony to adjust ( Holldobler and Wilson , 1990 ) . Individual ants set on specific tasks have to be capable of widening or of shifting their 1 Abt . Verhaltensphysiologie , Universitat Tubingen , Beim Kupferhammer 8 , 72070 Tubingen , Ger - many .

In order to test individual flexibility , research has been focused on the effect of an altered age structure ( e . g . , Ehrhardt , 1931 ) or the experimental removal of distinct castes like workers ( Gregg , 1942 ; Wilson , 1984 ) or of specific size classes ( Wilson , 1980 , 1983a ) . In all these experiments individual ants were capable of adapting to the manipulations by expanding or changing their work repertoire . Recently , the focus of research has been the influence of colony size on individual behavior ( Gordon , 1992 ; Gordon etal . , 1993 ; Herbers and Choin - iere , 1996 ) . Reliability theory predicts that extremely small colony sizes neces - sitate an individual ' s adoption of a wider array of tasks or a more precise execution of tasks since no backups are available ( Oster and Wilson , 1978 ; Bourke and Franks , 1995 ) . The studies showed that changes in individual and colony level behavior were a function of colony size . On the other hand , age polyethism , the age - based division of labor , might restrict profound switches in task allocation since the causal relationship between age and task could lead to rather fixed repertoires in age classes ( e . g . , Wilson , 1976 ; Tsuji , 1990 ; Tofts and Franks , 1992 ) . Furthermore , Robinson and Page ( 1988 ) showed that the genetic structure of an insect society plays an important role in the division of labor , challenging the view of eusocial insect societies consisting of behaviorally totipotent individuals . There is evidence that both mechanisms , namely , flexibility on an individ - ual level , on the one hand , and a multitude of specializations ( i . e . , age , caste , or genetic ) , on the other hand , could contribute to organizational adaptations of colonies [ for a discussion see Franks and Tofts ( 1994 ) versus Robinson et al . ( 1994 ) ] . Their relative importance , however , remains to be clarified . Thus the question arises in what way individuals can change their behavior and how this individual flexibility influences colony - level organization . In the present study colony fragments of different sizes , all sampled from the same mother colony , were used to test individual foraging behavior . Thus genetic and age differences are minimized by randomly assigning workers of the same colony to different subunits . Foraging behavior was chosen because the activities of foragers are directly dependent on the trophic needs of the colony ( Vowles , 1955 ; Wallis , 1962 ; Sorensen etal . , 1984 ) . Working with queenless and broodless fragments enables us to distinguish between the effects of the trophic need per individual ant and the trophic need per colony without the disproportionate influence of an egg - laying queen and her brood . Each forager ' s own trophic need should be roughly independent of colony size , whereas the trophic need per colony increases monotonically along with increasing colony size . Thus the forager should intensify her foraging effort as a function of the number of ants in the nest . Two prerequisites have to be met : ( 1 ) that the forager receives information about group size and ( 2 ) that the forager is capable of intensifying her effort to meet the higher trophic need of the group . An inten - 494 Burkhardt Individual Flexibility and Tempo in Pheidole dentate , the Influence of Group Size 495 sification of foraging on the scout ' s side could be accomplished by doing the task faster , i . e . , increasing tempo ( Leonard and Herbers , 1986 ) , or by reorga - nization of the task in involving other group members . Consequently the fol - lowing hypotheses are investigated . Individual foragers should change their behavior with changing group sizes . Alternatively , foragers should increase their tempo to meet the increased demands of larger groups . In addition , the impact of these individual adaptations on group - level behavior might differ consider - ably . MATERIALS AND METHODS One large , mature colony of Pheidole dentata collected from a garden in Durham , NC , was subdivided into 48 groups of sizes between 5 and 30 ants ( Table 1 ) .

Pheidole dentata is strictly dimorphic and both subcastes have distinct tasks in the colony ( Wilson , 1976b ) . Unequal numbers of experimental groups among the size classes were due to a limited ant supply . At least 75 individual ants were randomly assigned to each size class in order to balance chance differences in age distribution between groups [ e . g . , older ants have tasks mainly at the periphery of the nest , like foraging ( Wilson , 1976b ) ] . Accordingly , more groups ( up to 15 per size class ; see Table I ) were set up in the small colony fragments , thus balancing behavioral effects due to accidental deviations from the mean age distribution by a sufficient number of replicates . The ants were introduced into square containers ( 9 . 7 X 9 . 7 cm ) which contained a glass vial ( 2 drams ; half - filled with water sealed by cotton and wrapped with black paper ) , a thin layer of dirt and a food dish ( watch glass ) positioned in the corner farthest away from the entrance of the vial . The small area of the container ensured a higher detec - tion rate of the food even by single ants . In each feeding experiment an approximately 1 - mm 3 food pellet ( Bhatkar and Whitcomb , 1970 ) was introduced on the food dish . It was not easily retriev - able because the pellet stuck to the food dish . However , a single ant was capable of loosening it from the dish and of carrying it alone into the nest . The feeding experiments lasted for 30 min or until the food pellet had arrived in the nest , whichever came first . The food was removed if it was not transported into the nest 30 min after it was discovered by the scout . The experiments were con - ducted in a non - air - conditioned room with a natural day - night cycle at the time of highest activity in the colonies between 1700 and 1930 . The experimental groups were starved for 3 days prior to each observation . For each of the 48 colony fragments up to four experiments were done , if possible within the minimal 10 days . Statistical analyses were performed on the means for each group at each colony size using SAS ( 1987 ) software for PC . Means were used in order to avoid pseudoreplication ( Hurlburt , 1984 ) and because behavioral variation of specific individuals or among individuals of the same group could not be distinguished since individuals were not marked . The experiments were performed in a 4 - month period ( May to August ) . Therefore , the mean number of experimental days counted from the day of onset of exper - imentation ( variable " experience " ) was entered in the analysis as an indepen - dent variable . This was necessary in order to elucidate the influence of experi - ence on foragers since groups that were not yet experimentals were fed ad libitum nonetheless . Age was not assumed to be of primary importance because the experiments were conducted later than 18 days after the theoretical eclosion time of any ant ( the queenless " mother colony " was given a week to settle in the lab ; in addition , the experimental groups were given another 10 days after setup to settle in the test tubes ) . Beyond 18 days of age workers of P . dentata are involved exclusively in external tasks ( Wilson , 1976b ) . Therefore the propensity of any individual ant to forage should not change through time , at least scarcely as a result of age but possibly as a result of experience . In most cases a multiple 496 Burkhardt regression was employed , with group size and " experience " as independent variables . Generally , the interaction terms were not significant and are therefore not shown ; all other types of analyses are depicted under Results . Dead ants were continually replaced as soon as a decline in numbers was observed . If the mortality was higher than three , the observation prior to the day of the count was discarded . In instances where the mortality was excep - tionally high ( 70 % and higher ) , the ants were not replaced and the colony fragment was abandoned . After the introduction of the food pellet , a stopwatch was started and notes were taken continuously as soon as the first ant ( i . e . , scout ) had discovered the food . Frequently the scouts interrupted feeding and either sat on the food dish or walked around in an apparently random fashion but resumed feeding later . Thus the scout ' s total feeding time as well as the time she spent on the food dish without feeding was recorded . The return time to the nest was measured from the last feeding until the scout had entered the test tube . Since all ants entering or leaving the nest were noted , recruitment and the time until the maximum number of ants had left the nest could be deter - mined—both measured from the time the scout had entered the nest . In the majority of experiments the food pellet was eventually removed from the food dish by one or more ants and was then singly or jointly carried into the nest ( food transport ) . In addition to the retrieval of the entire food pellet , the ants ingested food at the dish and regurgitated to nestmates after returning into the nest . RESULTS The Scout as a Conveyer of Information or as a Carrier of Food Scouts of small groups generally spent more time away from the nest , i . e . , the time between the detection of the food until they entered the nest was longer for scouts from smaller colony fragments [ Table I ; F ( l , 45 ) = 117 . 0 , P < 0 . 0001 ] . Experience had a shortening influence on that period [ F ( l , 45 ) = 9 . 0 , P < 0 . 005 ; all F values from a multiple regression ] . Feeding time represented the largest proportion of the overall time spent away from the nest ( between 67 and 84 % ) , followed by return time ( 11 to 15 % ) and the time spent on the food dish without feeding ( 3 to 12 % ) . Scouts from larger groups fed a much shorter time than the ones from small groups [ Fig . 1 ; F ( l , 45 ) = 61 . 9 , P < 0 . 0001 ] . Experience of the individual had a significant shortening influence on the feeding time of the scout [ F ( l , 45 ) = 10 . 9 , P < 0 . 002 ] . While feeding the scout has to decide when to interrupt ingesting more food in order to convey the information of the food ' s locality to its nest mates . The time the scout spent on the dish without feeding is a measure of the inde - cisiveness or lack of urgency of the ant . Scouts of small groups permitted more time to elapse without feeding or running back to the nest [ Table I ; F ( l , 44 ) = Individual Flexibility and Tempo in Pheidole dentata , the Influence of Group Size 497 498 Burkhardt Fig . 1 . Feeding time and return time of the scout in relation to the size of colony fragments . Mean time ± 1 SE . 13 . 3 , P < 0 . 0007 ] . Feeding time and experience as additional independent variables in the model were not significant [ F ( l , 44 ) = 1 . 8 , P > 0 . 18 , and F ( l , 44 ) = 0 . 5 , P > 0 . 49 , respectively ] . This means that indeciveness of ants within group sizes was independent of feeding time and experience . The effec - tivity of the scout in conveying the information about the food source is rep - resented as the time the individual spent from its last contact with the food until the scout entered the nest . Scouts of small groups took longer to return to the nest than the ones from larger groups [ Fig . 1 ; F ( l , 45 ) = 20 . 9 , P < 0 . 0001 ] . Experience , however , did not have any influence on return time [ F ( l , 45 ) = 0 . 3 , P > 0 . 7 ] . The Nestmates in Response to the Scout ' s Signal A recruiting scout arouses the colony by laying a scent trail and frequently by conducting display behavior ( Szlep - Fessel , 1970 ) . Initial recruitment ( the first 0 . 5 to 1 min after the scout entered the nest ) is characterized by a sudden outflow of ants from the nest . Small groups showed lower proportionate recruit - ment than large groups . In colony fragments of 5 ants majors did not participate in the first recruitment wave and less than 13 % were recruited in 10 - and 15 - ant groups , whereas in large groups major recruitment reached up to 58 % ( Table I ; r s = 0 . 67 , P < 0 . 0001 ) . Likewise minor recruitment was correlated with group size ( Table I ; r s = 0 . 40 , P < 0 . 006 ) , but the recruitment level was higher , ranging from 33 to 55 % , than major recruitment ( z = 5 . 7 , P < 0 . 0001 ; Wilcoxon signed - rank test for paired samples ) . Individual Flexibility and Tempo in Pheidole denlata , the Influence of Group Size 499 Fig . 2 . The effect of group size on maximum recruitment levels of the group after the scout has entered the nest . Values are mean proportions ± 1 SE . Maximum recruitment is defined as the maximum percentage of ants that have left the nest in response to the scout ' s recruitment . A low percentage ( 13 and 26 % ) of the available majors in small groups was eventually recruited , whereas significantly more ( up to 64 % ) were recorded in larger groups ( r s = 0 . 54 , P < 0 . 0001 ) . In contrast , maximum minor recruitment was not influenced by group size ( r s = 0 . 16 , P > 0 . 28 ; Fig . 2 ) . Nevertheless , major recruitment never reached a level as high as that of the minors in the same nests ( z = 5 . 16 , P < 0 . 0001 ; Wilcoxon signed - rank test for paired samples ) . The time until maximum recruitment is reached represents a measure of the intensity of the scout ' s recruitment and the intensity of the nestmate ' s reaction to that scout ' s signal . The deployment of minors in small groups was slower than in large groups [ Table I ; F ( l , 45 ) = 7 . 88 , P < 0 . 0008 ] , whereas the period until max - imum major recruitment was reached was not affected by group size [ Table I ; F ( l , 45 ) = 2 . 4 , P > 0 . 13 ] . Many of the recruited ants never arrived at the food . Up to 71 % of the recruits were eventually feeding in large groups , whereas only about 40 % reached the food in small groups [ Table I ; F ( l , 45 ) = 17 . 2 , P < 0 . 0001 ] . The Retrieval of the Food Food transport—one or more ants carry the food pellet into the nest—was observed in only 28 . 6 % of the individual observations in groups of 5 ants and in 54 . 3 % of the individual observations in groups of 10 ants . All other size 500 Burkhardt classes transported the food in all experiments conducted ( x 2 — 90 . 4 , df = 5 , P < 0 . 0001 ) . However , more than 10 % , i . e . , 7 of 62 , food transports in small colony fragments ( 5 to 15 ants ) were carried out by the scout without first having recruited her nestmates , whereas in larger groups ( 20 to 30 ants ) only 1 of 68 food transports was accomplished by a scout alone without prior recruitment ( P < 0 . 03 , Fisher ' s exact test ) . DISCUSSION This study showed that a scout is influenced by the social milieu of her nest even when she forages alone , outside that nest . In larger groups foraging is organized socially . A scout tests the food briefly , returns quickly to the nest , and recruits a considerable proportion of her nestmates . The food is always transported into the nest ( Fig . 3 ) . This is similar to mature queenright colonies ( see Szlep - Fessel , 1970 ) . In contrast , small fragments tend to organize foraging solitarily . The scout feeds for a long time and , after returning slowly into the nest , distributes the ingested food by trophallaxis . Recruitment is slow and weak and a low proportion of recruits reaches the food . Food transport is rare or , alternatively , is performed by the scout alone without prior recruitment of nest - mates ( Fig . 3 ) . One explanation for these organizational differences lies in the individual flexibility of the scout . Accordingly , the decision for ingesting a maximum amount of food rather than optimizing information transfer to the nest would be made on an individual basis . Disturbances of other foragers arriving at the food might have interrupted the scout ' s feeding , especially in larger group sizes . They were not responsible for shorter feeding times , however , since a reanalysis of only those experiments in which the scout fed alone and undisturbed resulted Fig . 3 . Flow diagram : effect of group size on task distribution . in a virtually identical negative relationship between group size and feeding time ( r s = - 0 . 82 , P < 0 . 001 ; n = 24 ) . A further indication of the scout ' s behavioral flexibility in small groups is the food transport into the nest by the scout alone and without prior recruitment . However , it is as yet unclear how decision making is influenced by group size , keeping in mind that the scout does not have direct contact with the rest of that group at the instant of decision making . Furthermore , the experimental setup excluded genetic , developmental , or age differences be - tween group sizes . Only the internal needs possibly expressed through the num - ber of interactions with hungry nestmates prior to foraging could have deter - mined the actions of the scouts . Colony fragments were used in order to investigate colony size as the sole determinant of organizational change of the scout ' s foraging . An egg - laying queen and brood would have influenced colony hunger disproportionately , not only due to the queen ' s greater mass but also due to a possible effect of colony size on the intensity of the queen ' s egg - laying ( e . g . , Fewell et al . , 1991 ; but see Burkhardt , 1991a ) . In contrast , the queen ' s influence on the organization of foraging is minimal [ Burkhardt ( 199la ) on Pheidolepallidula ] or unclear [ see Berbers ( 1982 , 1983 ) and Herbers and Choin - iere ( 1996 ) on Leptothorax and Myrmica ] . An alternative explanation for the observed flexibility of scouts makes fewer assumptions about their individual capabilities . Although we find a complete reorganization of foraging behavior—highly social foraging is replaced by indi - vidual , solitary foraging—these colony - level changes can be brought about solely by tempo change of the colony members ( Fig . 3 ) . Long feeding times , long return times , and low recruitment intensity are due to a slowing of the individual and to weaker signaling . Even decision making might be slowed down as a result of a lack of urgency to , e . g . , return home . This simple mechanism can be exemplified by the recruitment of majors and minors . Majors ( in contrast to minors ) are recruited by tactile stimuli of highly excited scouts but to a lesser degree by the scouts ' pheromones ( Szlep - Fessel , 1970 ; Detrain and Pasteels , 1992 ) . In the present experiments secondary recruitment rarely involved tactile stimuli and thus majors were nearly exclusively recruited by the scouts in the first recruitment wave . Thus in the first minute after the scout entered the nest both minor and major recruitment correlated with group size . Since majors never failed to leave the nest after receiving tactile stimuli ( personal observation ) , their extremely low recruitment levels in small groups ( Table I ) can be put down to a lack of urgency in the scout ' s signaling ( often missing tactile stimuli ) . Max - imum minor recruitment , however , reached similar levels in small and large groups ( Fig . 2 ) , due to accumulating , secondary recruitment waves , especially in small groups . In contrast , major maximum recruitment continued to correlate with group size . Consequently , maximum recruitment of minors was reached faster in large groups , indicating either extremely strong signaling on the scout ' s side or faster signal processing on the receiver side . Thus recruitment of majors Individual Flexibility and Tempo in Pheidole dentata , the Influence of Group Size 501 was nearly exclusively dependent on the scout ' s actions , whereas minor recruit - ment was initially dependent on the scout ' s signals , but later on signals from other returning group members . A colonywide change of tempo would necessitate a priming of each indi - vidual in relation to group size . This could be accomplished by CO 2 . Ants have the sensory capacity to perceive a wide range of CO 2 concentrations ( Kleineidam and Tautz , 1996 ) . The activity of ants is directly influenced by the CO 2 con - centration within the nest ( Burkhardt , 1991b ; Lechner , 1995 ) . Low CO 2 levels in small colonies due to fewer ants metabolizing CO 2 result in low activities of ants and this overall slowing might be sufficient for a complete reorganization of foraging ( Fig . 3 ) . Generally , experience did not affect tempo of the scout , with the sole exception of feeding time . Individuals from colonies where experiments had been done weeks after setup fed a shorter time than comparable individuals where the experiments had been done shortly after setup . This might be due to familiarity and prior experience with the feeding procedures and with the nature of the food , so that the animals ingested the food faster without testing it in advance . Surprisingly , experience did not affect the time a scout spent on the food dish without feeding , nor did feeding time . This means that experienced ants spending shorter time on the food still seemed to have as many problems deciding when to return home as inexperienced ants feeding for longer periods of times . There was no effect of experience on the scout ' s returning time in her recruitment - run toward the nest . Generally , experience was thought to have a strong influence on the performance of the ant and , particularly , in short - range orientation , where the recollection of landmarks plays a substantial role in the homing of ants ( Sudd , 1960 ; Holldobler and Moglich , 1980 ) . In this study , however , running speed and linearity of the recruitment - run could not be dis - tinguished . These two parameters , however , tend to be negatively correlated since highly excited scouts from large colonies were often observed running in circles or in a direction away from home ( see also Wilson , 1975 ) . High exci - tation levels triggered by hunger or the quality of food usually result in high running speeds ( Hangartner , 1969 ; Szlep - Fessel , 1970 ) and therefore the scouts might make orienting mistakes due to that excitement ( e . g . , Schneirla , 1971 ; Oster and Wilson , 1978 ) . Theories of self - organization in social insects have received a lot of atten - tion recently ( Bonabeau et al . , 1997 ; Bourke and Franks , 1995 , and references therein ) . Their major advantage is that a minimum of assumptions about the individual ' s capabilities have to be made . Individuals exhibiting simple behavior interact and thereby complex collective behavior emerges . Here I propose one possible mechanism underlying the phenomenon of outward organizational change without making assumptions about individual capabilities relating to decision making . By changing tempo in individuals , profound changes in the 502 Burkhardt outward organization can be observed ( see also Leonard and Herbers , 1986 ) . Thus , e . g . , ants from incipient colonies might not be timid or risk averse due to ontogenic differences , but they might just be slower and more difficult to excite . The resulting advantages for colony survival might be substantial both for incipient colonies and for colonies that have been hit by catastrophies , but this setup ( queenless and broodless colony fragments ) is not suitable for address - ing the colony level consequences of tempo change . This has been done exten - sively elsewhere ( Leonard and Herbers , 1986 ; Herbers and Choiniere , 1996 ) . Through changing tempo in ant colonies , characteristics of collective behavior are changed without the influence of goal directed signals or behaviors ; in addi - tion , no task switching or reallocation of workers is necessary since tasks are just performed with different intensity . Naturally , the importance and generality of this mechanism for colony organization still have to be investigated . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I thank W . Schlund , S . Sommer , and M .
