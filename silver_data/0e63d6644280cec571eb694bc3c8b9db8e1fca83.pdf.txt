Stretch is known to stimulate intra - cellular biochemical events , but the inﬂuence of the rate at which stretch is applied has not been extensively investigated . Also , most studies of VSMC mechanotransduction use cell culture models not aligned in the direction of stretch . We aligned human VSMC in the direction of uniaxial stretch to examine the importance of strain rate and cell orientation . We demonstrate strain rate profoundly affects stretch - induced phos - phorylation of extracellular signal - regulated kinase ~ ERK ! 1 / 2 . Low strain rate induced dephosphorylation while physiologic and high rates increased phosphorylation . Dephosphorylation at low strain rate was dependent on cell orientation matching the strain ﬁeld . Pretreatment with GDP b S indicated G proteins are required for ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation at physiologic strain rate . Apyrase addition to scavenge extracellular ATP inhibited ERK1 / 2 regulation at low and physiologic strain rates . These results indicate strain rate and cell orientation are important components of mechanotransduction . © 2003 Biomedical En - gineering Society . @ DOI : 10 . 1114 / 1 . 1543935 # Keywords— Extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2 , Aligned cell culture , Cell orientation , G protein . INTRODUCTION Mechanical forces play a central role in the physiol - ogy of a variety of tissues . Responsiveness of vascular smooth muscle cells ~ VSMCs ! to mechanical cues is the basis of myogenic tone and the autoregulation of blood ﬂow . However , the complex nature of mechanical forces experienced in the vascular wall make elucidation of the intracellular events responsible for this function problem - atic . The rate at which a strain is applied is a fundamen - tal part of a mechanical stimulus . This component of mechanical force changes with blood pressure , heart rate , vascular wall elasticity , and other factors , but the inﬂu - ence of strain rate has not been extensively investigated . Smooth muscle cells in the media of arteries align in a predominantly circumferential direction . 33 This orienta - tion exposes the long axis of VSMCs to the greatest stretch with each cardiac cycle and permits VSMC con - traction to produce the maximum reduction in vessel diameter . In contrast , when cultured VSMCs are grown on deformable substrates and subjected to an applied cyclic strain ﬁeld , the cells align perpendicular to the greatest strain direction . 5 , 6 This cellular reorientation be - gins within several hours of the onset of stretch and is preceded by reorganization of the cytoskeleton . Experi - mental production of aligned cell cultures has been done mostly with ﬁbroblasts . Predominant methods include micropatterning of a two - dimensional surface 2 or the po - lymerization of a three - dimensional gel containing ﬁ - brous substrates on which cells will align ; 24 when the gel is placed under stress the ﬁbers align in the stretch di - rection . Combining these approaches , Simpson et al . 28 polymerized a thin gel of aligned collagen ﬁbers on a deformable substrate by drawing a solution of collagen across a surface in a single stroke with a cell scraper . Myocytes were then seeded on the surface and aligned in the direction of the collagen . Cells exhibited a rod - like morphology and formed a tissue - like organization . Little work has been performed examining the effect of stretch direction relative to the long axis of a cell . In the study by Simpson et al . , myocyte contractile protein turnover was differentially regulated by stretch direction . Stretch parallel to the long axis of the cell had no effect , but stretch perpendicular to the long axis reduced protein turnover and promoted protein accumulation . Mudera et al . 24 examined matrix protease expression in ﬁbro - blasts seeded in different regions of a three - dimensional collagen gel . The authors found expression of MMP1 , 2 , and 3 , which allow a cell to digest its surroundings presumably to align itself with a strain ﬁeld , were high - est in the nonaligned region of the gel .

The MAP kinase subfamily known as extracellular signal - regulated kinase ~ ERK ! 1 / 2 is activated by dual phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues and has been implicated in a variety of physiologic re - sponses . While traditionally associated with regulation of nuclear proteins in proliferating cells , in nonproliferating VSMC ERK1 / 2 is believed to be phosphorylate cytosolic proteins , which inﬂuence contraction . 4 MAP kinases have been shown to be activated by stretch in both vas - cular smooth muscle tissue 1 and cell culture 20 , 26 systems ; indeed , ERK1 / 2 is used as a stereotypical marker for cell responsiveness to mechanical forces . 10 Dephosphoryla - tion , and hence deactivation , of MAP kinases can be executed by members from all three families of protein phosphatases ~ tyrosine speciﬁc , serine / threonine speciﬁc , and dual speciﬁcity ! . 36 Tyrosine speciﬁc ~ PTP ! and serine / threonine speciﬁc ~ PPP and PPM ! protein phos - phatases are thought to be regulated by post - translational modiﬁcation and / or localization . 9 , 25 The dual speciﬁcity protein phosphatases acting on MAP kinases , MAP ki - nase phosphatases ~ MKP ! , are regulated at the level of transcription and can be induced by the MAP kinases they dephosphorylate , leading to the theory that MKP act as negative feedback regulators of MAP kinase cascades . 20 In this report , we investigated the effect of strain rate and cell alignment on ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation as an index of mechanotransduction in aligned human vascular smooth muscle cells . To distinguish the effects of strain magnitude from strain rate , cultures were stretched at several strain rates over a range of strain magnitudes . Results indicate strain rate has a profound effect on ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation with a slow rate inducing a dephosphorylation relative to unstretched controls . This dephosphorylation was dependent on smooth muscle cell orientation matching the strain ﬁeld and was partially inhibited by pretreatment with GDP b S . In contrast , higher strain rates produced an increased phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 , which was eliminated by GDP b S but only partially inhibited by nonalignment of the culture . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture VSMCs were harvested from the arteries of human umbilical cords by an enzyme digestion method . Fresh umbilical cords were collected from a local hospital , cleaned of exterior blood , and soaked in dissection buffer @ HBSS , 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin , 1 % fungizone ~ Irvine Scientiﬁc ! # for 2 – 3 h at 4 °C . After soaking , cords were transferred to a lami - nar ﬂow hood and the arteries removed while the tissue was bathed in fresh dissection buffer . The arteries were then cleaned of any attached ﬁbrous tissue , slit open to remove endothelium , and cut into 1 – 2 mm 2 squares for digestion . The tissue pieces were rinsed twice in cold digestion buffer ~ HBSS , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ! and transferred to a 250 mL bafﬂed Erlenmeyer ﬂask . Diges - tion was carried out in an isotemperature hood controlled at 37 °C on a shaker table rotating at 90 rpm with 5 % CO 2 air sterile ﬁltered into the overhead . The diges - tion solution consisted of digestion buffer supplemented with 200 U mL 2 1 of Collagenase IV and 2 U mL 2 1 of Elastase ~ Worthington ! . 2 – 2 . 5 g wet weight of tissue was digested in 50 mL of digestion solution for 4 h . The digested tissue was then ﬁltered through a 70 m m nylon cell strainer ~ Becton Dickinson ! to remove undigested material , centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min , then resus - pended in 7 . 5 mL of growth media @ DMEM ~ Irvine Sci - entiﬁc ! , 20 % FCS ~ Hyclone ! , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin # . The cells were transferred to a T - 25 tissue culture ﬂask ~ Falcon ! and grown in a humidiﬁed incuba - tor with a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere at 37 °C . Passage 0 cul - tures were grown at least two weeks with ﬂuid replace - ment every two to three days . VSCM cultures were expanded by trypsinization the same day cells became conﬂuent and were seeded into T - 75 tissue culture ﬂasks at a concentration of 1 3 10 4 cells cm 2 2 in 15 mL of growth media . Cultures were maintained for no more than eight passages . Cells exhibited typical morphology , hill - and - valley pattern typical of smooth muscle cultures , and stained positive for smooth muscle a - actin , smooth muscle myosin heavy chain , and h - caldesmon . Substrate Preparation for Cell Alignment The following technique improved upon one de - scribed in Simpson et al . 29 by application of uniaxial stretch to a thin gel of polymerized collagen . A stock collagen solution was produced by mixing , on ice , 250 m L 10 3 minimum essential medium ~ Irvine Scientiﬁc ! and 250 m L 200 mM HEPES ~ pH 7 . 0 , Sigma ! . To this was added 4 . 5 mg type - I collagen from solution ~ Becton Dickinson ! and mixed by gentle inversion . The solution was diluted to a volume of 5 mL with serum - free DMEM for a ﬁnal collagen concentration of 0 . 9 mg mL 2 1 . 0 . 5 mL of the stock solution was added to the center of a medical grade 13 . 5 cm 2 , 0 . 010 - in . - thick , si - lastic membrane ~ Specialty Manufacturing ! , preas - sembled in the uniaxial stretch device described below . The solution was spread over the surface with a cell scraper by back and forth motion only in the direction of desired alignment then transferred to a humidiﬁed incu - bator with a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere at 37 °C and allowed to polymerize for 30 min . To enhance the uniformity of cell alignment achieved by the original protocol , uniaxial stretch of 25 % of initial length was applied to the silastic membrane in the direction of desired alignment over another 30 min . After a 5 min rest period , excess col - 240 N . L . M C K NIGHT and J . A . F RANGOS lagen was removed . Final membrane surface area was 18 cm 2 with a ﬁnal collagen concentration in the thin gel of 17 – 20 m g cm 2 2 . The gel was then dried down onto the membrane overnight in a laminar ﬂow hood . The next day , dry gels were sterilized by UV irradiation for 25 min and rehydrated by incubation with serum - free DMEM for at least 1 h at room temperature . Suspended VSMCs were seeded onto the membranes in growth me - dia at a concentration of 5 3 10 4 cells cm 2 2 and cultured for 1 – 2 days . VSMC cultures were then serum deprived by ﬂuid replacement with quiescence media @ DMEM , 1 % BSA ~ Fraction V , Sigma ! , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin # and incubated for a further 2 – 3 days . To assess the impact of alignment on VSMCs , the alignment technique was modiﬁed to generate randomly aligned cultures . 0 . 5 mL of stock collagen solution was applied to 18 cm 2 silastic membranes and spread with a cell scraper in random directions and with circular motions . The gel was allowed to polymerize for 30 min , and remained in the incubator an additional 35 min but was not subjected to stretch . Other manipulations are as de - scribed above for the alignment technique . Validation of the alignment technique was performed by capturing digital phase - contrast micrographs ~ Nikon , Diaphot ; DVC model 1300 camera ! of cultures and making a quantitative measurement of alignment using software designed to measure mean orientation and angular devia - tion of lines within an image . 18 Application of Uniaxial Stretch Aligned smooth muscle cell cultures were generated and stretched in a uniaxial stretch device described in Clark et al . 3 Brieﬂy , substrate preparation and cell cul - ture were performed within a sterile enclosure on rect - angular , 0 . 010 - in . - thick silicone membranes held at each short end with stainless - steel clamps . A linear stepper motor ~ Anaheim Automation ! applied cyclic strain to one clamp assembly while the opposite clamp remained sta - tionary . Stretch was applied parallel to the direction of VSMC alignment . The system is capable of a variety of standard or specialized waveforms and allows for the independent control of strain and strain rate . Physiologic levels of strain and strain rate are within the operational parameters of the device . Substrate strain of various magnitudes and rates was delivered continuously during a stretch bout using a sawtooth wave form ~ Fig . 1 ! . The sawtooth waveform implemented was modiﬁed to accel - erate from , and decelerate to , zero speed over 5 % of the duration of stretch between turnaround points . This ‘‘dull’’ sawtooth was chosen to maximize the time ~ 90 % ! spent at a speciﬁed strain rate while not subjecting cells to a theoretically inﬁnite change in strain rate at the points in the pure sawtooth . Aligned VSMC cultures were rinsed once then covered with 1 mL of fresh qui - escence media then stretched continuously for 10 min at 37 °C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . A 10 min stimulus was chosen based on previous work showing a stretch - induced ERK activation plateau at 10 min , which lasted approximately 30 min before declining to sham values . 14 , 26 Protein Preparation and Western Blotting At the cessation of stretch , cultures were rinsed with ice cold PBS , lysed with SDS sample buffer ~ 62 . 5 mmol tris (cid:149) HCl , pH 6 . 8 , 2 % wt / vol SDS , 10 % glycerol , 20 % vol / vol b - mercaptoethanol , and 0 . 1 % wt / vol bromophe - nol blue , Sigma ! , boiled for 5 min , sheared with an insulin needle , and stored at 2 80 °C until analyzed . Equal volumes of sample were separated by SDS - PAGE on 12 % acrylamide running / 5 % stacking minigels . Gels were then equilibrated in transfer buffer ~ 192 mM gly - cine , 25 mM tris , 20 % methanol , Sigma ! for 15 min and electroblotted onto PVDF membranes ~ Immobilon P , Millipore ! . Following transfer , membranes were rinsed then incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer ~ 10 mM tris pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % tween - 20 , 5 % nonfat milk ! .

Stretch was applied continuously for 10 min . Continuous stretch at a given strain magnitude and rate resulted in a different number of cycles per unit time (cid:132) differ - ent frequencies (cid:133) for each stretch regime . 241 Strain Rate Mechanotransduction in Smooth Muscle ciﬁc for phosphorylated or total ERK1 / 2 ~ Cell Signaling Technologies ! were incubated for 1 h at room tempera - ture in blocking buffer at dilutions of 1 : 2500 and 1 : 1000 , respectively . Membranes were rinsed with wash buffer ~ 10 mM tris pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % tween - 20 ! six times for 5 min each then incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat antirabbit secondary antibody ~ Cell Signaling Technologies ! for 30 min in blocking buffer at a dilution of 1 : 2000 followed by another six washes . Phosphorylated and total ERK1 / 2 bands were visualized using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit ~ Pierce ! according to manufacturer instructions and ex - posed to ﬁlm ~ Fuji ! for 3 – 15 min . Films were digitized by scanning ~ AGFA Duoscan T2500 ! and densitometry was performed using Scion Image software . To account for variable total protein concentration in samples , the phosphorylated ERK1 / 2 signal was normalized to total ERK1 / 2 . To allow accurate comparison of different Western blots , unstretched sham pairs were run on all gels and their phosphospeciﬁc to total ERK1 / 2 ratios were deﬁned as 1 . 0 . ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation is ex - pressed as the ratio of phosphorylated to total ERK1 / 2 signals and is displayed as fold of a dedicated sham . Statistics All results are reported as the mean 6 SEM , normal - ized with respect to dedicated controls from each experi - ment . Data were ﬁrst evaluated by one - way analysis of variance ~ ANOVA ! , followed by the Bonferroni t - test for multiple comparisons . The relative impacts of strain rate and magnitude were analyzed by two - way ANOVA . A p , . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . RESULTS Validation of Cell Alignment Procedure Uniformity of VSMC alignment was quantiﬁed by analyzing digital images of cultures with an algorithm that calculates orientation and pattern of alignment . 18 To optimize the protocol , silastic membranes were prepared with magnitudes of 0 % , 25 % , and 50 % uniaxial stretch applied to the thin collagen gel after polymerization and before air drying and cell seeding . A fourth set of mem - branes was prepared according to the nonalignment pro - tocol . Membranes had different ﬁnal surface areas but the same concentration per cm 2 of collagen . VSMCs were seeded and cultured 2 days in growth media , and 2 days in quiescence media before images were taken . Fig - ure 2 shows a series of histograms indicating the fre - quency and distribution of angles measured on mem - branes prepared by the indicated variation on the alignment protocol and normalized to be representative of counts for a single membrane . Zero degrees was de - ﬁned as the direction of applied uniaxial stretch . All means were within 16° of zero and the standard devia - tion decreased with increasing strain . Figure 3 ~ A ! is a representative image of aligned VSMCs , and Fig . 3 ~ B ! shows a typical image of nonaligned cultures . Cells in FIGURE 2 . Distribution of cell orientation . Histograms of cell orientation in cultures prepared using different variations of the alignment protocol (cid:132) see the text (cid:133) . An automated software program measured line angle frequencies in phase contrast micrographs taken of four to eight cultures after cell seeding and culture for 4 days . Frequencies were normalized to be representative of counts from a single membrane . 242 N . L . M C K NIGHT and J . A . F RANGOS aligned cultures showed little variation in orientation over several ﬁelds of view . Nonaligned cultures exhibited local alignment but transitioned to variable orientation over several cell lengths . For all preparations of aligned VSMC cultures for stretch experiments , a collagen gel strain of 25 % was used . Greater strains did not produce signiﬁcant improvement in uniformity of alignment and put the membrane under such large tension that any imperfection in the manufacture or cutting of the mem - brane led to catastrophic tearing and loss of the culture . Bidirectional Regulation of ERK1 / 2 by Strain Rate Aligned human VSMC cultures were subjected to a matrix of dynamic stretch regimes representing average subphysiologic , physiologic , and superphysiologic strain rates and magnitudes . Aligned , quiescent cultures were stretched for 10 min and assayed for ERK1 / 2 phospho - rylation . The stretch device was programed to impose strain magnitudes of 5 % , 10 % , and 15 % strain and strain rates of 1 % s 2 1 , 10 % s 2 1 , and 50 % s 2 1 . Experiments were conducted at every combination of strains and strain rates ~ Fig . 4 ! . Phosphospeciﬁc ERK1 / 2 densitom - etry measurements were normalized to total ERK1 / 2 and expressed as a fold of unstretched sham controls . ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation in samples subjected to 1 % s 2 1 strain rate were signiﬁcantly lower than sham for all strain magnitudes ~ 0 . 76 6 0 . 10 at 5 % strain , p , 0 . 05 ; 0 . 54 6 0 . 06 at 10 % strain , p , 0 . 005 ; 0 . 72 6 0 . 09 at 15 % strain , p , 0 . 05 ) .

The relative impact of strain rate versus magnitude on ERK1 / 2 phosphoryla - tion was found with two - way analysis of variance . This analysis revealed strain rate , but not magnitude , had a signiﬁcant affect on stretch - induced ERK1 / 2 phosphory - lation ( p , 0 . 01 ) . There was also a signiﬁcant interaction between strain rate and magnitude inﬂuencing ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation ( p , 0 . 01 ) . Sham controls were not in - cluded as a group in the two - way ANOVA because the intent was to extract the relevant importance of strain rate and magnitude independent of the overall affect of stretch . All subsequent experiments designed to probe for mechanisms of strain rate mechanotransduction were per - formed at the physiologic strain magnitude of 10 % strain and compared unstretched sham controls and strain rates of 1 % s 2 1 and 10 % s 2 1 . Dependence of Strain Rate Mechanotransduction on Cell Alignment To determine if cell orientation in the strain ﬁeld affected mechanotransduction , nonaligned quiescent cul - tures were stretched at 10 % strain magnitude and strain rates of 1 % s 2 1 and 10 % s 2 1 for 10 min and assayed for ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation ~ Fig . 5 ! .

Comparison of aligned and nonaligned stretch samples showed a signiﬁ - cant increase at 1 % s 2 1 strain rate ( p , 0 . 002 ) and a signiﬁcant decrease in ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation for non - aligned cultures at 10 % s 2 1 strain rate ( p , 0 . 05 ) ~ cf . Figs . 4 and 5 ! . Participation of GTP Binding Proteins in Stretch Regulation of ERK1 / 2 G proteins are ubiquitous signaling molecules which have been shown to be activated by mechanical stimuli in other systems 11 – 13 and are important to many aspects of VSMC function . 30 GDP b S is a GDP analog which binds and inactivates G proteins by locking them in the GDP bound conformation . Aligned , quiescent cultures were preincubated with 900 m M GDP b S for 3 h ~ Ref . 19 ! before being stretched at 10 % strain magnitude and strain rates of 1 % s 2 1 and 10 % s 2 1 for 10 min and as - sayed for ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation ~ Fig . 6 ! .

Inhibition of Stretch Regulation of ERK1 / 2 by an ATP Hydrolyzing Enzyme To explore the role of ATP release and autocrine ac - tivity as a mechanism of mechanotransduction in VSMCs , cultures were treated with the ATP hydrolyzing enzyme apyrase during stretch .

Because apyrase treatment stimulated ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation in unstretched controls , the affect of apyrase treatment on stretch - induced ERK1 / 2 phospho - rylation was gauged by comparing stretched samples that had been normalized to their own ~ apyrase treated or untreated ! sham controls . This analysis revealed apyrase treatment completely blocked ERK1 / 2 dephosphorylation at 1 % s 2 1 ( p , 0 . 002 ) and partially inhibited ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation at 10 % s 2 1 ( p , 0 . 05 ) ~ cf . Figs . 4 and 7 ! . DISCUSSION This study demonstrates for the ﬁrst time that stretch - induced ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation in human VSMCs is strain rate sensitive ~ Fig . 4 ! . Further , a slow strain rate ~ 1 % s 2 1 ! causes dephosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 in a man - ner dependent on cell orientation in the strain ﬁeld ~ Fig . 5 ! . Previous studies have not explicitly considered strain rate when generating dynamic stretch regimes . The most popular cell straining system , the Flexercell unit , is typi - cally operated at constant frequency in an on / off cycle with an undeﬁned , and very high , strain rate in between stretched and relaxed states . 14 , 16 , 23 , 26 , 27 This unit also pro - duces a nonuniform strain ﬁeld . 8 These factors result in a highly nonuniform strain rate ﬁeld within a given sample that is also changed when different average strain mag - nitudes are applied . Conﬂicting results have been re - ported , which have been attributed to species variation , developmental state of source animals , or vascular bed source . 23 The current study addressed several possible sources of variability reported in the literature . It utilized a cell straining device that applied a uniaxial stretch and is capable of independent control of strain magnitude and rate . Human VSMCs from an arterial vessel were aligned parallel to the direction of stretch , comparable to in vivo conditions . Stretch regimes for this study were chosen to be representative of average subphysiologic , physiologic , and superphysiologic strain magnitudes and rates . A value of 10 % strain magnitude was chosen as physi - ologic based on a review of arterial mechanical proper - ties by Dobrin . 7 Physiologic strain rate ~ 10 % s 2 1 ! was determined by dividing the strain magnitude by the ap - proximate duration of the human cardiac cycle ~ ; 1 s ! . This value is appropriate as an average , but because the pulse wave form in vivo is composed of an initial rapid stretch ~ approximately 0 . 1 s ! followed by a slower relax - ation , the strain rate at any given time during the cardiac cycle may be as much as an order of magnitude higher or lower than this value . 17 Examination of VSMC cultures generated with the alignment technique revealed cultures organized into a tissue - like architecture . Cells grew side by side , their long axes in parallel , with cell orientation relatively in - variant over the whole surface of the culture ~ Fig . 3 ! . The difference between aligned and nonaligned VSMC cultures was only detectable on a length scale larger than the long axis of the cell . Nonaligned VSMC cultures organized into the same local architecture , but the long axis direction slowly changed over several cell lengths . Markers of VSMC differentiation ~ smooth muscle a - actin , smooth muscle myosin heavy chain , and h - caldesmon ! were expressed equally in aligned and non - aligned cultures and revealed equivalent cytoskeletal ar - chitecture ~ data not shown ! .

A previously unreported decrease in ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation was seen at the subphysiologic 1 % s 2 1 strain rate for all strain magnitudes . Physiologic and su - perphysiologic strain rates elicited an increase in ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation . This response saturated with increasing strain rate since no signiﬁcant difference between 10 % s 2 1 and 50 % s 2 1 strain rates were detected at any strain magnitude . However , strain magnitude may have a modulating effect on strain rate sensitivity . Two - way ANOVA tests for differences among groups when the groups have been subjected to two independently chang - ing variables , in this case strain rate and magnitude . The test assigns relative amounts of ‘‘responsibility’’ for the differences to each variable and / or an interaction be - tween the two . Two - way ANOVA on the data from the present study assigned a statistically signiﬁcant propor - tion of responsibility to strain rate for the observed dif - ferences in ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation state while strain magnitude was not . However , the interaction of the two variables also generated signiﬁcant differences among the groups . This may reﬂect the large range of strain rates versus a comparatively narrower range of strain magnitudes or the fact that a nonzero strain rate cannot be imposed without also generating a strain magnitude . Alternatively , coupled with the observation that physi - ologic strain magnitude elicited the greatest changes in ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation state ~ Fig . 4 ! , the ANOVA re - sults may also suggest that smooth muscle cells are most sensitive to strain rate changes when stretched near physiologic conditions . It should be noted that only VSMC cultures not subjected previously to frozen stor - age were used in this study . Cultures reanimated after frozen storage displayed uniform activation of ERK1 / 2 in response to stretch at all strain rates ~ data not shown ! . Alignment of smooth muscle cells in the strain ﬁeld is crucial to strain rate sensitivity . Examination of the ef - fects of stretch on nonaligned cultures showed the de - crease in ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation at 1 % s 2 1 strain rate had been eliminated . Further , ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation increased to a level equal with that at 10 % s 2 1 strain rate ~ Fig . 5 ! . Nonaligned cultures expressed the same VSMC markers as aligned cultures and were morphologically identical up to the scale of several cell lengths , suggest - ing biochemical pathways and cytoskeletal architecture are equivalent . This is supported by the ﬁnding of equal basal ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation levels in unstretched samples . The increases in ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation in nonaligned cultures ~ 1 . 47 6 0 . 20 and 1 . 51 6 0 . 15 fold sham ! are signiﬁcantly lower than the increase in phos - phorylation in aligned cultures stretched at 10 % s 2 1 strain rate ~ 1 . 94 6 0 . 19 fold sham ! . One explanation for this observation is the existence of dual mechanisms for strain magnitude and strain rate transduction . Stretching of VSMCs may activate one pathway leading to ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation independent of strain rate or magnitude and somewhat insensitive to cell orientation . Competing with this pathway may be another causing ERK1 / 2 de - phosphorylation , dominant at low strain rates , and com - pletely dependent on cell orientation matching the strain ﬁeld . Interestingly , PP2A , a serine / threonine speciﬁc phosphatase , can interact with microtubules , 31 possibly FIGURE 7 . Apyrase treatment to deplete extracellular ATP inhibits stretch - induced changes in ERK1 (cid:213) 2 phosphorylation . In (cid:132) A (cid:133) , aligned cultures were stretched for 10 min in the presence of 2 U mL (cid:192) 1 of Apyrase at 10 % strain magnitude and the indicated strain rates and assayed for ERK1 (cid:213) 2 phos - phorylation .

F RANGOS providing a link to the orientation dependence of ERK1 / 2 dephosphorylation . However , identiﬁcation of the protein phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylat - ing ERK1 / 2 awaits speciﬁc protein phosphatase inhibitor studies . ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation in nonaligned cultures was not signiﬁcantly different when stretched at both strain rates even though some VSMC in nonaligned cul - tures were oriented in the direction of stretch . This sug - gested the strain rate sensitive mechanism was overpow - ered by the more robust stretch - induced activation of ERK1 / 2 when cells were not stretched in an in vivo - like architecture . Both heterotrimeric and small G proteins are known to participate in pathways leading to ERK1 / 2 phospho - rylation . Pretreatment with the G - protein inhibitor GDP b S completely abolished the ERK1 / 2 activation ob - served at 10 % s 2 1 strain rate , suggesting heterotrimeric G proteins , small GTPases @ e . g . , p21ras ~ Ref . 20 ! # , or both , are members of the pathway . ERK1 / 2 dephosphorylation at 1 % s 2 1 strain rate was partially , but not signiﬁcantly , inhibited by GDP b S treatment . However , the power of our experimental system to detect a statistically signiﬁ - cant inhibition of 50 % was approximately 0 . 15 – 0 . 20 ~ a 100 % inhibition was excluded with a power of 0 . 70 ! , meaning a reasonable possibility of an undetected partial inhibition existed . A partial inhibition was consistent with three scenarios . First , the ERK1 / 2 dephosphorylat - ing pathway does not have a GTPase member and the partial inhibition was the result of a nonspeciﬁc interac - tion or impairment of cellular function . However , basal ERK1 / 2 was not signiﬁcantly affected by the treatment . Second , inhibition of the ERK1 / 2 deactivating pathway may be incomplete because of insufﬁcient GDP b S intra - cellular concentration or incubation times . Although the complete inhibition of ERK1 / 2 activation at high strain rates would argue against this possibility , if a G protein with a very low basal turnover rate were involved in the dephosphorylation pathway , it may explain a partial in - hibition . Third , one or more G proteins may play a re - dundant or otherwise noncritical role in ERK1 / 2 deacti - vation , which may represent the interaction between strain magnitude and strain rate sensitivity . This scenario includes the possibility that signaling molecules down - stream of G - protein activation were modulated through cross talk by mechanotransduction mechanisms not in - volving G proteins . In any case , the different sensitivity of strain and strain rate ERK1 / 2 regulation to orientation and inhibition implies the mechanical coupling , and per - haps primary mechanotransducer , were different . Hamada et al . 14 proposed ATP release and autocrine action on purinergic receptors as a mechanism for sens - ing stretch in VSMCs . Their study primarily examined cyclic stretch - induced ATP release and activation of JNK / SAPK , another member of the MAP kinase family . The authors concluded stretch caused ATP release and induced JNK / SAPK activation that was mediated by both autocrine dependent and independent mechanisms . The present study examined the effects of stretch induced ATP release on ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation by treatment with apyrase , a 45 – 50 kDa protein with ATP and ADP hydrolyzing activity . 15 Apyrase treatment of VSMCs stretched at 1 % s 2 1 strain rate abolished the deactivation of ERK1 / 2 found in untreated samples while ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation observed at 10 % s 2 1 strain rate was sig - niﬁcantly reduced . Interpretation of these results was complicated by the ﬁnding apyrase treatment signiﬁ - cantly increases basal ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation . In - creased basal ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation during apyrase treatment implied ATP was constitutively released and stimulated ERK1 / 2 dephosphorylation or that the pres - ence of apyrase somehow stimulated ERK1 / 2 in human VSMCs . Elimination of the ERK1 / 2 dephosphorylation at 1 % s 2 1 strain rate would support the former possibil - ity . However , the role of extracellular ATP as stimulatory for ERK1 / 2 dephosphorylation was contradicted by inhi - bition of ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation at 10 % s 2 1 strain rate , which suggested ATP release caused ERK1 / 2 activation as seen in other studies . 34 , 35 Basal release of ATP may be explained by the high ATP concentration gradient across the plasma membrane . Evidence of stretch - induced plasma membrane breaks or ‘‘porosity’’ 22 , 32 under physiological conditions suggests large amounts of ATP may exit the intracellular space during physiologic stretch due to increased plasma mem - brane permeability . Diffusion of ATP would be further enhanced with apyrase treatment by maintaining the ex - tracellular ATP concentration at near zero . Intracellular ATP depletion promoted by apyrase activity presents an - other mechanism of action of apyrase treatment . The inhibition of increased ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation observed at 10 % s 2 1 strain rate may be the result of depletion of ATP for the reaction on ERK1 / 2 and / or other kinases . However , elimination of ERK1 / 2 dephosphorylation at 1 % s 2 1 strain rate cannot be explained by this mecha - nism unless a kinase is required for this event . ATP depletion may also inhibit dephosphoryation if the path - way involved a high energy event such as protein syn - thesis . Indeed , synthesis of MAP kinase phosphatase - 1 ~ MPK - 1 ! , a phosphatase speciﬁc for ERK1 / 2 and other MAP kinases , is regulated at the transcriptional level and is activated by cyclic stretch within 8 min . 20 Thus , the exact role stretch - induced ATP release in this system is unclear . ERK1 / 2 phosphorylates the contraction regulatory protein caldesmon 1 and D’Angelo and Adam 4 showed ERK1 / 2 participated in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase during endothelin - 1 stimulated con - striction of artery segments , suggesting ERK1 / 2 has the ability to regulate VSMC contraction . However , Loufrani et al . 21 reported that isometric stretch - induced myogenic 247 Strain Rate Mechanotransduction in Smooth Muscle tone and ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation were mediated by separate pathways , and that force generation was inde - pendent of ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation . Similar to the re - sults in this study , Davis and Sikes 6 found the myogenic response to intraluminal pressure changes applied at dif - ferent rates could be described by a mechanism with both static - and rate - sensitive components , but did not measure ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation . Taken together with the results of this work , these studies suggest that when VSMCs are dynamically stretched , strain rate sensitivity of the myogenic response may be mediated by a pathway that also regulates ERK1 / 2 . However , because these re - sponses are sufﬁciently downstream of early mechan - otransduction events , this study cannot discern whether the strain rate sensitive pathway inﬂuences myogenic tone in parallel with ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation or acti - vates cellular systems that potentiate ERK1 / 2 regulation of contractility . In summary , this study has demonstrated the mecha - notransduction of strain rate in human VSMCs . The strain rate regulation of ERK1 / 2 also exhibited a depen - dence on cell orientation in the strain ﬁeld . The impor - tance of these previously unappreciated aspects of mechanotransduction may help explain conﬂicting data among other studies and prove useful in the design and interpretation of future work .
