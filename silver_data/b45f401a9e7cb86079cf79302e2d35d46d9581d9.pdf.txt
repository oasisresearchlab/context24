Making Spaces : How Design Workbooks Work William Gaver Interaction Research Studio Goldsmiths , University of London w . gaver @ gold . ac . uk ABSTRACT In this paper , I discuss design workbooks , collections of design proposals and related materials , both as a method for design and as a design methodology . In considering them as a method , I describe a number of examples of design workbooks we have developed in our studio and describe some of the practical techniques we have used in developing them . More fundamentally , I discuss design workbooks as embodiments of a methodological approach which recognises that ideas may emerge slowly over time , that important issues and perspectives may emerge from multiple concrete ideas , potentially generated by multiple members of a team , rather than being theory - driven , and that maintaining the provisionality and vagueness of early proposals can be useful in supporting a quasi - participatory design approach that allows participants to interpret , react to and elaborate upon the ideas they present .

General Terms Design INTRODUCTION In this paper , I discuss the creation , collection and use of design workbooks in our practice . Workbooks are collections of design proposals and other materials drawn together during projects to investigate options for design . They can be used at various points in the design process , but in this paper I will focus mainly on workbooks created during the early stages of projects . As I will describe , at din the turn from considering background research towards possible designs , are produced from an array of resources and using a range of techniques , describe design ideas to greater and lesser degrees of resolution , address a number of audiences , and take a variety of forms . What they share , I will suggest , is not just the description of a design space but its creation : through the multiplicity of design ideas they contain they implicitly suggest important issues , approaches and options that might be considered in designing for a given situation , and in their provisional nature show those ideas , approaches and options in the making and still malleable to change . Design workbooks can be considered as a design method , and I discuss some of the practical techniques we use in our team to develop them . More fundamentally , however , workbooks are also evidence of , and a tool for , a methodological approach which recognises that ideas may develop slowly over time , that important issues and perspectives may emerge from multiple concrete ideas , potentially generated by multiple members of a design team , rather than being theory - driven , and that when the provisionality of early ideas is maintained in their expression , design workbooks can support a quasi - participatory design approach as people interpret , react to and elaborate upon the ideas they present . Finally , design workbooks are also interesting for their own sake , as explorations of topics and approaches that extend beyond the eventual outcomes of design projects . This paper does not describe any particular workbook in enough detail to explore an associated design space in depth , but the illustrations I use may still be of interest for the domain - specific ideas they convey . Of course , the use of design workbooks is hardly unique to our practice 1 . Producing and collecting proposals in one form or another is a fundamental process in design work . My purpose in reflecting on our practice here is two - fold : first , I hope to help other designers reflect on their practices by articulating our own , and second , by sharing this way of working more broadly I hope to help in ‘dispelling the black art of design’ [ 13 ] to those working within other methodological traditions . 1 The proposals shown here were developed by various design teams with whom I have worked ; see the acknowledgements .

CHI 2011 • Session : Design Materiality May 7 – 12 , 2011 • Vancouver , BC , Canada 1551 TWO WORKBOOKS To ground the discussion , in this section I describe two early workbooks . These serve to illustrate the roles that workbooks can serve in the design process , and also some of the basic techniques that can be used in developing them . Later I will describe more recent examples , as I focus more closely on how workbooks can be constructed . The Alternatives Workbook The first workbook was compiled as part of a project on ‘information appliances’ , a then - voguish concept of computational products specialised to offer one or a few functions with simplicity and elegance ( e . g . [ 11 ] ) . Dissatisfied with current examples of what such devices might be like , I spent some holiday time putting together about a dozen very rough collages of alternative devices that explored a range of personal and idiosyncratic possibilities . The images were constructed from pictures of household goods scanned from a catalogue before leaving on holiday , and thus were extremely limited in range and quality . For example , Figure 1 shows the image used to introduce the idea of an ‘Objective View’ camera . This was an idea for a device that could be launched tens of meters into the air to capture an image of the user in his or her surroundings , counter - acting the normal self - centred view of whatever troubling situation might be bothering them . Constructed from a picture of a corkscrew arranged over one of a bowl , the notion was that the swirling tail might indicate flight , and the indentation of the bowl could suggest a data receiver . Though crude , images such as this one seemed to work well when accompanied by relatively extensive descriptions to convey ideas that were , at the time , relatively unusual . This sketchy , quickly - produced workbook first evoked a rather bemused response from my partner on the design team , but ultimately proved effective in generating discussion and design explorations of other possible devices . As these progressed we decided to capture them in a more visually finished workbook for circulation to our sponsoring collaborators . Though still relatively simple to produce , the images used in this workbook included a number of new features : background images , electronic displays superimposed on everyday objects , and wholly constructed elements , all of which reflected both a greater range of available visual resources and more time spent using software tools such as Photoshop™ to develop images . For example , Figure 2 shows part of the image used to accompany a proposal for Placeholders , small electronic screens that could present information in the home independently from the computers that might feed them . Though centred on an image of a postcard holder , similar to the everyday artefacts used in the first workbook , it is substantially augmented with a background image of a table and crockery , as well as constructed imagery of possible screen contents . The completed Alternatives workbook included ten proposals , each presented on a double - page spread in A4 landscape format , bound together to form a small booklet . We distributed the workbooks to our partners on the project and described the ensemble in a meeting and presentation before leaving them behind . This was a key event in the project : the workbook made clear a domain of interest and a style of work that clearly influenced the rest of the project ( for examples of later work , see [ 10 ] ) . In addition , the workbook itself became the subject of a publication in its own right [ 6 ] , in which we described the individual proposals and the overall design space they created . Perhaps most telling , for the purposes of this paper , was the argument that the proposals served similarly to a collection of prototypes , providing relatively concrete ‘devices’ that viewers could mentally simulate and critique as they might ones that were physically realised . WORKBOOKS IN THE DESIGN PROCESS As these examples indicate , workbooks can play an important role , both functionally and experientially , in early stages of the design process . In this section I treat them as a method for design , arguing for the benefits of making and using them . A Turning Point One of the most valuable roles for design workbooks is as a fulcrum in the transition from initial background research to the generation of designs to be developed . This stage of design is often a daunting one , when attention turns from the richness of an existing situation to the blank page of a design sketchbook . There are a number of ways to go wrong in making this turn . It can be tempting to develop ideas quickly and commit to the first one that seems satisfactory ; or , alternatively , design teams may become suspended in diffuse discussions of situations and general possibilities they offer . Design ideas can be trapped in iterative versions of the status quo , or dislocated by technical possibilities that may have little to do with the context for design . Design workbooks can help to overcome and even profit from many of these challenges . Figure 1 . The Objective View proposal from the first , in - house Alternatives workbook . Figure 2 . Detail of the Placeholder proposal from the second Alternatives workbook . CHI 2011 • Session : Design Materiality May 7 – 12 , 2011 • Vancouver , BC , Canada 1552 Buying Time Resolving to produce a workbook at the outset of a design process makes clear that the object of coming up with ideas is not to define a final design directly , but to understand the nature of problems and possibilities to be addressed in a given domain . This means that a given idea does not have to bear the full weight of a project ' s expectations , but there is still an obligation to act , and a requirement to concretise ideas , which are crucial in moving beyond vague notions of possibility . Considering whether specific proposals might work allows a clearer sense of promising design directions to be gained . In effect , workbooks are a tool in developing from initial research towards a brief for design . Design workbooks are a mechanism to compel ‘safe’ creative activity ( though often this encourages exploration of relatively ‘risky’ possibilities ) but they also have the advantage of ensuring that this does not happen too swiftly . This is particularly appropriate for research through design projects , where the responsibility is to create original perspectives and possibilities , without many of the time pressures of commercial design projects . Producing workbooks can take days , weeks , even months , particularly when care is taken over the quality of images and text within them . Both the time taken to create proposals , and their treatment as contributions to a collection of ideas rather than a representation of final designs , can help in avoiding premature commitment to particular notions or even broad design directions . Moreover , a side effect of the time and effort needed to produce workbooks is the tendency to filter out unpromising ideas and to allow broad themes to emerge and grow . Effort follows enthusiasm : there is a tendency to represent the most intriguing ideas first , during which time other ideas may lose interest while new ones , based on the first , start to develop . This filtering can happen within a team as well as individually as proposals are shared and discussed . In this way , the process of developing a workbook is not just a matter of producing a physical artefact but also the ideas within it and a shared ground within the design team . Externalising Ideas Using images and text to express design ideas often entails developing those ideas . Creating workbook proposals is not a matter of externalising internal visions : trying to turn an idea into a proposal often reveals just how woolly and incomplete that idea is , and in developing the proposal one is likely to be forced to resolve certain of the its details in order to proceed . As I will discuss later , the kinds of representations used in developing proposals can usefully maintain ambiguity and provisionality , so that not all—indeed , not many—details need be resolved . Nonetheless , the requirements of capturing a design idea in images and text can be useful in forcing its further consideration . Externalising ideas in the form of proposals acts as the first step towards realising them as independent entities , apart from their creator . Sometimes proposals can take on a life of their own , for example when the resources used to externalise them shape their details in unanticipated directions ( as , in an extreme instance , the limited images used in creating the first Alternatives workbook shaped those proposals ; see Figure 1 ) . Even when proposals develop in a way that conforms comfortably with the original notion behind them , their independent existence gives the designer an opportunity to view and assess them as if found rather than owned . Can I imagine this device / system / service existing in the world ? Would it be engaging ? What’s good about it ? What would be annoying ? Moving an idea into the world also allows it to be seen in an external context , whether literally against a setting used in depicting the proposal or implicitly in its relationship to other products , prototypes and proposals that surround it . This process of de - identification with design possibilities , and of integrating them with the world , is valuable in allowing them to be assessed independently from an individual designer ' s likes and dislikes . They emerge from their creator’s voice to take on their own , Projecting Futures Implicit in the move from appreciating an existing situation to considering possible designs is a turn from understanding the past and present towards anticipating possible futures . Most of our proposals are not ‘futuristic’ , instead exploring possibilities that could already have existed at the time of their creation . Nonetheless , they point to a future , even if it is a future differentiated from the present by their realisation , and invite viewers to imagine what that future might be like . Contrast with Design Scenarios Many techniques exist for exploring the potential futures of proposed systems , many of which can be grouped under the broad category of design scenarios ( e . g . [ 2 ] ) . Taking the form of storyboards , videos , or simple text descriptions , scenarios usually create narratives about people using the proposed system in different contexts . Design scenarios can be very useful in allowing designers to work out and communicate how they imagine the systems they propose would be used . Moreover , developing scenarios can be a useful mechanism for working out the details of designs , just as externalising design proposals can motivate the development of the ideas behind them . In practice , design scenarios often share two characteristics , however , that can limit their utility . First , the majority present largely positive accounts of the experience and effects of using the systems they consider . This is not surprising , given that the work to develop design scenarios is usually motivated by enthusiasm for the systems they describe , and , insofar as scenarios are to be used to communicate the possibilities to other stakeholders , their authors want to convey that enthusiasm effectively . But it can be unfortunate , because a focus on intended use can divert attention from potential problems or overlooked issues , some of which may even lead to new and more promising ideas ( c . f . [ 4 ] ) . The second characteristic that design scenarios often share is that of presenting a unitary vision of a proposed system’s future . By creating a detailed scenario of use , there is a tendency to collapse the CHI 2011 • Session : Design Materiality May 7 – 12 , 2011 • Vancouver , BC , Canada 1553 space of possibilities suggested by a design idea , curtailing a fuller exploration of its implications . Few of our design proposals include detailed scenarios of their intended use . Instead , they indicate what a system might do and establish , often implicitly , the ' needs ' it might address , usually without including details of how this would be achieved technically or accessed by an interface . In their reticence , they invite viewers to speculate about these prospects themselves . It is not uncommon for people seeing our proposals—including , importantly , ourselves—to generate multiple stories of how the devices they describe might be used . These stories may include dystopian possibilities as well as positive ones ( though rarely scenarios in which the devices are simply ignored ) , they may trace multiple , alternative paths , explore various technical and formal implementations , lead to suggestions for qualitatively different alternatives , and invoke different values ( e . g . aesthetic or ethical ) at different times . By avoiding the specification of detailed design scenarios , proposals can trigger speculation that opens the design space rather than closing it , which is often of great benefit in the early stages of design . Creating Design Spaces I have suggested that a single design proposal , when expressed with a requisite openness , can hint at a range of possibilities as it occasions people ' s speculation about the functions it might offer , how it might be realised , the circumstances in which it might be used , and the sorts of experiences and values it might serve . The power of design workbooks is in creating a much larger landscape for exploring such concerns by exploiting the combinatorial explosion of similarities and differences among many such proposals . Consider , for instance , the Alternatives Workbooks described earlier [ 6 ] . The proposals they contained included two proposals for how information might be displayed in the home , a suggestion for an audio - only city guide that might lead you on unusual routes to your destination , a proposal for an artificially - intelligent birdfeeder that would train local songbirds to sing tunes of the user’s choice , a device allowing people to influence their partners’ dreams , another that would allow people to exercise their psionic powers , and one that would allow people to transmit their voices directly into space , whether as a form of electronically augmented prayer , or in an attempt to capture the attention of passing aliens . Each of these proposals was potentially desirable and technically plausible , and indeed we later developed several of them further . Their real utility for the project , however , was in delineating a range of possibilities , technically , topically , and experientially , and in helping us to think about them ourselves and communicate them with our partners . For instance , the technologies they indicated ranged from displays and projectors to handheld devices , sensors , public displays , and so on . They simultaneously opened up a variety of technology we might consider , while implicitly suggesting that others , most notably those involving traditional arrangements of computers and monitors , were less interesting . In terms of topics , they brought into play issues of how information enters and is displayed in the home , how and why people navigate in the city , the importance of spirituality and non - traditional beliefs , our relationship with wildlife and each other , etc . If the differences among the Alternatives pointed to a range of options for further investigation , equally important was what they had in common . Most fundamentally , all of the Alternatives proposals explored forms of engagement marked by curiosity , exploration and wonder rather than by the utilitarian pursuit of tasks . By presenting relatively concrete examples of technologies expressing such values , they simultaneously allowed the inductive definition of a genre of design for ludic engagement and provided a number of quasi - existence proofs that such an approach might be possible and interesting . The notion of a ‘design space’ is a valuable metaphor for the way design workbooks can affect designers’ perceptions of possibility . On the one hand , insofar as the similarities amongst the proposals they contain allow them to be seen as an integrated collection , workbooks pick out a particular configuration of concerns from amongst the vast range of possibilities open to design . On the other hand , their differences imply a kind of dimensionality that allows for other ideas—room to move around a central set of concerns and among the particular possibilities suggested by the proposals . Of course , like any metaphor , the notion of a design space can be misleading . To begin with , variations among a reasonably sized set of proposals are not likely to reduce to a few dimensions , nor is it always useful , or even possible , to locate all proposals along all dimensions of contrast . One implication of this is that it is naive to think that simply looking in the ‘spaces’ between proposals can be a mechanism for generating new ideas . Instead , like a ‘landscape’ ( rather than abstract Euclidian space ) , there may be areas that are impenetrable or uninhabitable . One of the challenges of design , from this perspective , is to identify the areas within a design space that can be successfully developed . Design creates the spaces in which it operates . They do not pre - exist their manifestation , whether as undiscovered design ideas or as the abstract and rationalised parameter spaces that some of those who follow Simon [ 12 ] might suggest . Design workbooks are helpful in the process of elaborating a design space because in their multiplicity and simplicity they can allow the creation of a wide and complex territory relatively quickly , and in their provisionality they can invite the exploration of that space to discover particularly fertile areas within it . In sum , constructing design workbooks can be valuable in turning from appreciating what is towards speculating about what might be . They ease the pressure of designing the ‘right CHI 2011 • Session : Design Materiality May 7 – 12 , 2011 • Vancouver , BC , Canada 1554 thing’ [ 14 ] , allowing designers to consider a range of external options and imagine how these might evolve , and to create and explore a space of designs before choosing to develop a particular option . In the next part of this paper , I describe another two design workbooks before turning to a discussion of the techniques for constructing proposals in this way . TWO MORE WORKBOOKS The Alternatives workbooks used a fairly limited set of techniques in their construction , largely involving collage , product visualisation and textual descriptions . In this section I describe a pair of more recent workbooks to illustrate a number of other techniques we have used in developing design proposals , as material for a more detailed discussion of techniques to follow . Equator Workbook 1 The second two workbooks were produced in the course of developing designs within the Equator Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration , which brought together seven UK university groups to explore how computational technologies can blur the boundaries between electronic and physical worlds in everyday life ( www . equator . ac . uk / ) . Within Equator , our group focused on home technologies . With such an open - ended brief , an integral part of developing specific designs was to decide for ourselves how to orient to the home , what sorts of topics and activities our designs might address , the overall perspective we might take in addressing those topics and values , and the technologies that might help us do so . We set the stage with a Domestic Probes study of London households [ 8 ] , as well as through eclectic research into possible views on the home ranging from previous work in HCI , sociology and the arts to psychoanalytic accounts of the home , descriptions of the home as a hiding place for contraband , and popular news articles about unusual domestic activities . As our research matured , we moved to a phase of developing sketch proposals for the home in an improvised , inspiration - driven manner . The four members of the design team developed the proposals relatively independently , with frequent informal discussions in the studio to share ideas and coordinate development . After several months of developing our ideas we grouped the proposals into categories in a post hoc fashion , and gathered them together in a workbook of about 50 more - or - less distinct proposals and related treatments printed in A4 landscape format . The individual team members each had their own techniques and approaches for expressing design ideas , so proposals varied in their visual appearance and use of text ( see Figure 3 ) . An overall shared style did emerge , however . The images used a variety of resources : found imagery , diagrams , and computer - generated images that themselves ranged from the clearly hand - constructed ( e . g . Sailor’s Return on the bottom right of Figure 3 ) to the more impersonal ( e . g . Product Wars in the bottom centre ) . Nonetheless , the overall graphical style of this workbook is more open than the second Alternatives workbook , with more white space and a lack of background images . In addition , the spreads are looser , often juxtaposing images to a b c d e f Figure 3 . Proposals from Equator Workbook 1 . CHI 2011 • Session : Design Materiality May 7 – 12 , 2011 • Vancouver , BC , Canada 1555 provide multiple views on an idea rather than presenting a single visual scenario . The text of Equator Workbook 1 is also sparser than that of either Alternatives workbook . Many of the proposals include only a title and a line of explanation , with only a few using slightly longer explanations . For instance , the ‘Sailor’s Return’ proposal shown on the bottom right of Figure 3 recounts a short narrative : Gilbert comes home from sea and settles down to his first decent cup of his renowned Columbian coffee in 2 months . The neon sign outside the flat fizzles to life . “Gilbert’s back” , says Harry passing on his way to the Hope and Anchor . The text here conveys the essential idea of the proposal both technically and in terms of its most obvious intended social impact with humour and economy . Other proposals are much drier descriptions that leave the sociocultural implications implicit . For instance , the text accompanying the ‘Nonessential Object Autosort’ proposal at the top centre of Figure 3 reads : Step 1 : A network of sensors monitors room activity in order to determine a hierarchy of space . Step 2 : Place any non - essential objects— ornaments , curios , unwanted gifts etc—in the trolley . Step 3 : The trolley then moves the objects around the home and finds unused space for them to live . Finally , a number of proposals consisted only of a single image and title . For example , the proposal at the bottom centre of Figure 3 is simply entitled ‘Object Wars . ’ Such proposals point to a possible issue to be developed or situation to be explored while leaving both technologies and sociocultural implications completely unspecified . We produced Equator Workbook 1 as a resource for our in - house design work , but also to distribute to our partners from other universities to indicate the direction of our work , share ideas , and invite collaboration . One group reviewed the workbook page by page in a meeting , and later told us that their attention was particularly caught by a proposal that suggested measuring the “Net Weight of the Home” by recording the total mass of all items entering or leaving the premises , thus allowing inhabitants to track whether their home was gaining or losing weight over time . According to their accounts at the time , this inspired the group to investigate how to equip surfaces ranging from floors to shelves with load - sensors to enable tracking of objects upon them . Their research in this area in turn led our group to consider applications of load - tracking technologies , which led to our first tranche of prototypes produced in the project [ 5 ] . Equator Workbook 3 Several years were occupied in developing the designs and field trials that resulted from Equator Workbook 1 . As this phase ended we started to consider the new directions our design research might take . We did not feel the need to undertake more research on homes , given how much we had learned from our original research and through the field trials of the prototypes we had developed . Instead , the task was to develop new perspectives and approaches that might be productive for our designs . Once again , producing a workbook was an important stage in developing the ideas that eventually led to a set of new prototypes . Similarly to the first Equator workbook , this was produced over several months by the team working individually with occasional informal meetings to discuss progress . The workbook comprised about 40 pages in A5 portrait format , and was divided into four sections : ‘Tracking Objects In The Home’ , ‘Storage And Display : How Our Stuff Is Represented’ , ‘Links To The Outside World’ , and ‘Imaginary Extensions’ . Workbook 3 contrasts visually with Workbook 1 in using fewer diagrammatic treatments and including more contextualised images . More interesting for the sake of this discussion , however , is the way it mixes different presentations of ideas . Some of the pages ( e . g . , Figure 4a ) describe project ideas as was done in the earlier workbook . a b c d e Figure 4 . Pages from Equator Workbook 3 . CHI 2011 • Session : Design Materiality May 7 – 12 , 2011 • Vancouver , BC , Canada 1556 Other pages , in contrast , explore more general issues . Figure 4b , for instance , highlights the proportion of space in our homes dedicated to storage . Others show images of artworks we found inspiring or directly suggestive of possible designs . Figure 4c , for example , shows Ilya Kabokov’s ‘Paradise Under the Ceiling’ , which suggests that inaccessibility may lead to a sense of wonder [ 9 ] . Still other treatments show illustrations of technical equipment that are suggestive without being directly relevant . For instance , 4d shows samples of movie - making equipment helpful in considering dramatic presentations of stored objects . Finally , some images showed results of our own design explorations . Figure 4e , for example , shows photographs taken of seldom - considered details of one of our homes . Similar mixtures of general considerations , artistic landmarks , external resources , experiments and proposals were used to explore a variety of topics . Workbook 3 was again distributed to our project partners , but the primary intention in producing it was to advance our own design thinking . Over the following months , our development focused on one of the main themes of the workbook , having to do with the information thresholds of the home , culminating ultimately in the development of three deployed prototypes [ 7 ] . CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES The four workbooks illustrate a range of techniques for constructing design proposals . In this section , I reflect on our practice , both to share methods that have been effective and , in particular , as a way of articulating the implicit intentions behind expressing ideas in particular ways . Making Images Few design proposals are described in words alone . Images are invaluable in expressing ideas for several reasons . They afford communicating an object’s form or relationship with other components , as for example in Figure 3f . They allow a design to be appreciated both as an integrated whole and as a collection of more detailed parts , as in Figure 3c . Even if unable to fully convey complex ideas , images can serve as summaries or reminders , as in Figure 3d , or as shorthand representations of the basic issues , as in Figure 3e . Images also tend to compel a degree of resolution about details of design ideas , which entails benefits and risks . This applies not only to the specification of functional aspects of a design , but also to the emotional or aesthetic tone it might convey . On the one hand , the specificity of images can be useful in encouraging consideration of aspects that might otherwise be left vague or overlooked altogether . In addition , the concreteness of images allows the ideas they represent to be approached as if they have an autonomous reality , independent from a particular imagination , which is useful in developing a disinterested stance towards them . However , their concreteness and detail can be dangerous in encouraging ideas to be treated as fixed , leading to designers becoming reluctant to explore alternative concepts or forms , or alternatively to objections to general ideas based on particular treatments . One of the aims in creating images for proposals , then , is to achieve a useful balance between resolution and indication , between actualising a design idea and leaving it open to change . Collage and Found Images Existing images can be a useful resource in constructing design proposals . They are appealing both for pragmatic and expressive reasons . On the one hand , they offer an appealing alternative to other forms of image creation insofar as they only require selection rather than creation ( although a great deal of time may be spent finding and processing digital images , e . g . for use in collages ) . They can be used to imply that a proposed design might embody a similar form and scale , use similar materials , and perhaps involve similar technologies . In short , found images can sometimes be used as fairly literal representations of proposed designs . More interesting , however , is the use of found imagery as indicative rather than representative . Images carry with them a host of information about materials , styles , kinds of people and places , aesthetics and cost that vivify them beyond their literal depiction of form and scale , and this can all be used to indicate features of proposed designs . The images used in Figure 1 , for example , do not represent the intended appearance of an Objective View device , and it seems unlikely they would be interpreted as such . Instead , features of the image may trigger associations that can inform further design . The corkscrew’s ridged handle , for instance , might resemble a cloud , indicating that the camera is to be launched high overhead , while the curling blade might symbolise the radio waves that would beam an image to the waiting receiver / bowl , or perhaps look like flight lines tracing the device’s trajectory . Perhaps the corkscrew as a whole looks like a thundercloud , symbol of the stormy moods in which the device is to be used . Or perhaps it simply looks like a relatively high - priced gewgaw . Thoughts such as these , transient , speculative , hardly attended to , may be elicited by found imagery without requiring explication or commitment ; often , found images may be chosen simply for the unexpected , difficult to control connotations they carry . Collages build upon the suggestive potential of found imagery . They can be used relatively directly as building blocks to construct new images , but equally their power can lie in the combination and contrast of different parts . This can complicate the set of associations they make available , but equally , it can simplify interpretation by reinforcing some elements and not others . The Prayer Device ( Figure 5 ) , from the second Alternatives workbook , is an example of a collage , designed to form a single coherent image , which works in these ways . It was constructed by joining an image of a snorkel to part of an image of a floorlamp , whose glass shade has been inverted . Used to visualise a device that would transmit one’s voice to the heavens , the bowl suggests an upwards - facing transmitter ( rather than a source of illumination ) while the mouthpiece indicates not only a place that one might speak ( rather than breathe ) , but that speaking would be a intimate and potentially uncomfortable affair . CHI 2011 • Session : Design Materiality May 7 – 12 , 2011 • Vancouver , BC , Canada 1557 Found imagery can also be a useful resource in suggesting new ideas for design . Collecting , juxtaposing and relabeling ( c . f . [ 3 ] ) existing images while attending to their connotations and associations can be a fruitful source of inspiration . On these occasions , constructing proposals can merge with ideation itself . Diagrams and Renderings Found images and collage can lead to richly evocative images , but finding appropriate images can be difficult , and the results can lead in undesirable directions . A more controlled technique for constructing proposals is to produce imagery directly , in the form of diagrams , drawings and renderings at various degrees of finish . Most of the proposals in Figure 3 , from the first Equator workbook , are constructed in this way . They range from the fairly literal renderings of the Positive Action Channel Changer shown in 3c , in which the televisions’ audio signal would be monitored and the channel automatically changed in the case of inappropriate content , to the illustrations resembling cartoons ( 3e ) or caricatures ( 3f ) . The degree of detail of a diagram or rendering can be useful in indicating how developed a design is thought to be . Very simple , untextured , geometric renderings can give a basic indication of form and scale while clearly avoiding further commitment ( e . g . 3d ) . However , detailed renderings are not necessarily to be taken as resolved . For instance , the Nonessential Object Autosort system shown in 3b indicates the functional requirements of a robot designed to stow ‘non - essential’ possessions using a fairly detailed , but highly improbable , image—the exaggeration here ( as well as the title ) clearly indicating that the idea needs developing . Similarly , the warring appliances in 3e are detailed but intended to illustrate a concept , not an actual design , a fact which their absurdity as well as their lack of texture and background all help to indicate . Hybrid Images Often diagrams and renderings are used with found images . For instance , a photograph of an existing setting may be overlaid with a diagram of a system to be designed , the different styles of imagery clearly distinguishing the real from the imaginary . The Placeholder proposal in Figure 2 , for example combines a realistic backdrop with an image of a proposed device that itself combines collage with rendering . The simple block - and - clip picture - holder that represents the device’s base simultaneously indicates its small size and simple form as well as the casual flexibility and perhaps low cost it is intended to have , while the rendered screen above is a more literal interpretation of the digital content it might display . Similarly , the untitled proposal in Figure 3d suggests that we might install sensors into a room , which one of our participants devoted to the keeping of about twenty birds , and use the resulting data to somehow visualise the birds ' agitation as an indication of the household’s overall well - being . The notional nature of this proposal is conveyed by the use of only the most diagrammatic indication of the room and display , while photographs of birds indicate that they , at least , are real . Sketching While reviewing our workbooks and proposals to develop this paper , I found that sketches ( of the traditional , hand - generated sort ) almost never appear within them . This is somewhat surprising given that in our studio we all actively sketch ideas throughout the design process as a way of visualising possibilities , working out problems , and communicating with one another—as writers such as Buxton [ 1 ] have pointed out , sketching is a fundamental technique through which designers think . In fact , many of our workbook pages are the result of a sketching process , in which we use sketches to develop both the design ideas and their presentation . On reflection , there seems to be several reasons that we avoid reproducing sketches in our workbooks . First , they are too clearly authored to achieve the autonomy we require of them . Individual sketching styles are clearly identifiable , which makes merging proposals produced by different team members into an integrated collection difficult . In addition , traces of individual authorship may inhibit willingness to critique or suggest changes to the ideas they present , and this may be exacerbated when it is clear that a great deal of care has been put into their production . On the other hand , other methods of image generation also give evidence of the time taken to produce them , including the degree of conscious reflection about how to best represent an idea , that sketching may not indicate . Whereas sketches may be developed continuously from the first idea to the final drawing , other forms of production imply a pause for thought . In sum , the lack of sketches in our notebooks reflects the properties we desire for the proposals they include . Design proposals should convey ideas as independent entities , able to be considered as separate from their authors and as part of an integrated collection . In addition , proposals should clearly have matured beyond their first conception , yet retain a requisite degree of provisionality to bring the ideas into play for speculation , development and inspiration of new ideas . In short , design workbooks are neither sketchbooks nor specifications , but in between the two , and the techniques used to create them reflect this . Text Images are almost always used to convey design proposals , but text usually plays a significant role as well . The balance between text and imagery in clarifying ideas can vary widely . Sometimes images serve to illustrate proposals explained largely through text , while in other examples text merely clarifies how to read an image . I describe these Figure 5 . The Prayer Device is represented by a collage . CHI 2011 • Session : Design Materiality May 7 – 12 , 2011 • Vancouver , BC , Canada 1558 extremes separately to clarify the role that text plays and some of the writing techniques that are useful . Text as Primary In the Alternative workbooks , proposals relied on extensive text descriptions with images serving largely as illustrations to convey a sense of aesthetics and emotional tone . For example , the following text is from one of the proposals : Intimate View The objective nature of text , words , even video images is not only unsatisfactory for supporting distant love relationships , but even seems to interfere with the deeper , more subtle forms of interaction that create intimacy . The Intimate View seeks to build a visual connection between lovers , but constrained so that shared perceptions , rather than visual facts , become the object . This is achieved by transmitting images from a tiny macro camera , or personal scanner , worn on the body . By sharing only tightly focused portion of the local environment - - the veins of a leaf , a drop of water , the corner of one ' s smile - - the system would encourage partners to join together in a moment of highly focused mutual perception . Used playfully , aesthetically , or erotically , the device would permit rich new forms of loving communication to exist even over great distances . Like most of the Alternatives proposals , this text takes the form of a short essay . The first paragraph sets out a perspective and identifies a problem from this point of view . The second conveys the proposal itself , in terms of a desired effect and how this might be accomplished technically . The third suggests the anticipated implications of the system . These proposals may appear specific in the problems and solutions they describe , but they were intentionally written to be more ambiguous than they appear . For instance , they describe the technologies to be used in enough detail to seem plausible , but without over - specifying either a technical implementation or a particular interaction model . More fundamentally , important to the effect we tried to achieve was the tone we adopted in the writing . It is slightly over - earnest and yet deadpan , expressing a point of view clearly but without reflection or doubt . This adoption of an almost fictional voice—inspired in part by the artist Kabokov’s [ 9 ] presentation of proposals as the inventions of fictional teachers , brick - layers and plumbers—appears effective in encouraging readers to approach the ideas from a critical remove , much as the exaggerated images described earlier invite scepticism . Text as Subordinate Many of our design proposals are expressed primarily through images , with text serving mainly to clarify them . Captions , titles and labels may be used with extreme economy to great effect . For example , the Positive Action Channel Changer is explained using merely the title , a subheading ( ‘moderates programming output’ ) and two labels ( ‘Positive Action Listening Device’ and ‘Remote Commander Interface’ ) . These four phrases , in conjunction with the images , serve to communicate the proposal adequately within the design team , and moreover , by echoing a phrase used by one of the Probe participants , give an indication of the kind of person for whom the device is intended , and the values it is meant to support . Text is useful not only in explaining a proposed technology , but in setting its context and indicating the values that inform it . For example , the proposal for Products that Re - Advertise Themselves in Figure 4a contains a relatively lengthy description of how the system would operate , but also a simple caption : ‘Would reminders renew our relations with old possessions ? ’ that assumes a state of affairs ( we neglect old possessions ) , a set of values ( this neglect is undesirable ) and a proposed solution ( reminders ) , all in the form of a question inviting readers to think about their own position on the issues . In addition , text can be used to transform material uncovered from background research into design proposals in their own right . For instance , a collection of movie - making equipment shown in Figure 4c becomes a proposal with the addition of a caption : Observation technologies for the Smart Home include security systems , webcams , scanners and camera phones . Why not add other devices to these systems ? For example , lighting , flash , 3D scanners , scopes , tripods , rigs and special effects machines . Used in this way , simple captions can invite readers to extrapolate beyond the material included in a design proposal . Rather than pointing to a reified idea , proposals like these establish a starting point for further speculation , serving as seeds for further design work . DISCUSSION The different forms proposals take—the images and text used to construct them—can convey a great deal of information about their nuances and the ways they are to be approached . Humour , for instance , can open an idea for play without undermining the insight it suggests ( e . g . Figures 3b , e and f ) . Nonetheless , design workbooks also depend crucially on a community of practice that informs their interpretation and use . Many of the images and captions used in our proposals gain meaning within our team because they recall previous projects , conversations with volunteers , art and design work with which we are familiar , and cultural references that we share . Much as a conversation among old friends may be difficult for an outsider to comprehend , many of our proposals require explanation when used to communicate with project partners or the audiences for our design . Constructing design workbooks to rely on our community of practice has advantages , however . Most fundamentally , we share an understanding that everything in a design workbook should be addressed as a proposal : that is , as indicating a CHI 2011 • Session : Design Materiality May 7 – 12 , 2011 • Vancouver , BC , Canada 1559 direction and course of action for design . Increasingly , this applies to materials that we include in our workbooks that do not appear to be proposals at all . For example , the cut - away view of a house’s storage spaces in Figure 4b points to a direction for design to address the amount of ‘dead space’ this represents . The image of Kabakov’s ‘Paradise Under the Ceiling’ , in 4C , suggests finding ways to revivify stored possessions as objects of rarity and wonder . Finally , the movie - making equipment in 4D , and the snapshots of disused spaces in one of our homes in 4E , both serve as explorations of how this might be achieved . These implications and connections are only hinted at by the images and text of the workbook itself ; it is our established understanding of the role and purpose of workbooks that allows us to use them as they are intended . Design workbooks , in our group , also express and depend on an underlying methodological approach that stresses the importance of initial design explorations . Workbooks such as the ones described here often take weeks or months to construct . They defy the assumptions of brainstorming sessions as traditionally understood , in which valuable design ideas are thought to emerge from quick , uncritical sessions of free association . Instead , they reflect the labour and care we feel necessary to establish new design spaces successfully . At the same time , the workbooks we produce often contain dozens of proposals and treatments , the vast majority of which will not be developed . By serving as archives of a thought process that may extend over a long period , sketchbooks ensure that we do not discard unused ideas , but may return to them years later . Most fundamentally , then , the workbooks , and our profligacy with ideas , reflects the fact that what we value in the process is not just the specific ideas themselves , but the space of opportunities to which they give access . There can be problems in developing workbooks , of course . They are time - consuming to develop , and it can be seductive to over - produce them—that is , to craft their appearance beyond what is necessary to explore and convey a set of ideas . The proposals shown here were largely developed by experienced designers , but as Figure 1 indicates , they can also be realised effectively in a more amateurish style . In addition , workbooks are printed documents , which has several advantages ( portability , ease of annotation , the ability to control formality ) but means that representing dynamic interactions can be difficult ( though indications are still possible ) . Finally , the mix of resolution , openness and provisionality that makes the workbooks effective within our established design culture can make them confusing for outsiders . These potential pitfalls need to be negotiated as projects develop . More importantly , my description of developing myriads of proposals over long periods of time may make them appear unsuitable for commercial practice . This reflects our use of workbooks at the outset of open - ended research through design projects , when it is important to access a broad design space for investigation . In a commercial setting , however , such workbooks , developed across several projects , could be useful in establishing an ongoing sense of group identity , direction and style . We have also developed workbooks at later stages of projects , moreover , and for communicating ideas to participants and collaborators . Having already focused on a direction for design , our proposals tend to be fewer and more detailed , and the production time shorter , making these workbooks more similar to those that might be developed within commercial projects . Even in these more constrained situations , the commitment to multiplicity and provisionality the workbooks embody is useful in avoiding commitment to the first idea that seems feasible : workbooks still work to encourage exploration of rich and non - obvious spaces of opportunity .
