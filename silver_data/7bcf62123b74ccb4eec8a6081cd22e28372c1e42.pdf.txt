ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE . Recently , public attention has focused on the possibility that social network - ing sites such as MySpace and Facebook are being widely used to sexually solicit underage youth , consequently increasing their vulnerability to sexual victimization . Beyond anecdotal accounts , however , whether victimization is more commonly reported in social networking sites is unknown . PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS . The Growing up With Media Survey is a national cross - sectional online survey of 1588 youth . Participants were 10 - to 15 - year - old youth who have used the Internet at least once in the last 6 months . The main outcome measures were unwanted sexual solicitation on the Internet , deﬁned as unwanted requests to talk about sex , provide personal sexual information , and do something sexual , and Internet harassment , deﬁned as rude or mean comments , or spreading of rumors . RESULTS . Fifteen percent of all of the youth reported an unwanted sexual solicitation online in the last year ; 4 % reported an incident on a social networking site speciﬁ - cally . Thirty - three percent reported an online harassment in the last year ; 9 % reported an incident on a social networking site speciﬁcally . Among targeted youth , solicitations were more commonly reported via instant messaging ( 43 % ) and in chat rooms ( 32 % ) , and harassment was more commonly reported in instant messaging ( 55 % ) than through social networking sites ( 27 % and 28 % , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS . Broad claims of victimization risk , at least deﬁned as unwanted sexual solicitation or harassment , associated with social networking sites do not seem justiﬁed . Prevention efforts may have a greater impact if they focus on the psychosocial problems of youth instead of a speciﬁc Internet application , including funding for online youth outreach programs , school antibullying programs , and online mental health services . E XPLOSIVE GROWTH OF Internet use among young people 1 , 2 has been mirrored by increasing awareness of its potential positive 3 – 5 and negative impacts 6 – 8 on the health and development of children and adolescents . Recently , public concern 9 – 11 has focused on accounts of youth being sexually solicited and harassed on social networking sites , such as MySpace and Facebook . Some politicians and lawmakers are advocating measures to restrict youth access to social networking sites as a means of preventing online sexual exploitation of youth Internet users . 12 Beyond anecdotal accounts , however , whether social networking sites truly increase the risk of sexual solicitation and other forms of online victimization , including harassment , has not been empirically examined . Without empirical support , it is possible that parents and health professionals working with youth will be misdirected and wrongly informed about truly effective Internet safety measures . LEGISLATIVE ACTS TO CONTROL SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES The issue of sexual predators online has received much attention on Capital Hill . In one summer month of 2006 , 4 Congressional hearings were held on the subject , many resulting in calls for greater regulation and / or oversight of www . pediatrics . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1542 / peds . 2007 - 0693 doi : 10 . 1542 / peds . 2007 - 0693 ThecontentsofthisarticlearesolelytheresponsibilityoftheauthorsanddonotnecessarilyrepresenttheofﬁcialviewsoftheCentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention .

Copyright©2008bythe AmericanAcademyofPediatrics e350 YBARRA , MITCHELL by on April 20 , 2008 www . pediatrics . org Downloaded from social networking sites . 9 Congressman Michael Fitz - patrick ( R - PA ) introduced legislation that would require schools and libraries to restrict minors’ access to social networking sites , broadly deﬁned as sites that allow us - ers to create proﬁles or Web pages about themselves . 10 Claiming that social networking sites were the “virtual hunting ground for predators” ( as cited by ref 9 ) , Con - gressman Fitzpatrick named his bill the Deleting Online Predators Act . It passed the House with a sweeping ma - jority and was introduced into the Senate by Senator Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) as part of the Protecting Children in the 21st Century Act . 11 Discussions also have emerged from states attorneys general about the possibility of legal action against social networking sites to force them to introduce age veriﬁcation technology 9 to prevent chil - dren under the age of 16 or 18 years from posting proﬁles . Although some Web sites currently have mini - mum age requirements ( eg , MySpace restricts youth (cid:1) 14 years of age from having a proﬁle ) , they are largely reliant on self - report . There are potential challenges to both of these legislative and litigious initiatives , and useful discussion of them can be found elsewhere . 9 , 13 Of greatest importance however , is whether social net - working sites actually represent more of a risk to the safety of youth than other online venues so that restrict - ing access to them might noticeably reduce the preva - lence of Internet sexual solicitation and harassment among youth . In the absence of data , the rhetoric has the potential to redirect the attention of parents and health professionals from more risky online behaviors . TECHNOLOGY To understand the issues surrounding online sexual so - licitation and harassment , one needs to have a general understanding of how people known and unknown to youth , including in some cases sex offenders , can use these online communication technologies to target youth . A “chat room” is a place online where people gather to “chat . ” Most are open to anyone who wants to par - ticipate . Often the discussion is centered on speciﬁc sub - jects ( eg , depression , relationships ) . Communication oc - curs in real time because messages are visible to the other parties as soon as the writer hits the “enter” key . Although chat is viewed by all of the participants in the room , chatters can pair off for private talk . Many sites allow users to post proﬁles with photographs and per - sonal information , send photographs , and use Web cam - eras . Users create screen names , which can be a real name or a made - up name . Some chat rooms have rules and are monitored for compliance , but talk of sex in unmonitored teen chat rooms is common . 14 Youth can be targeted by unwanted sexual solicitation or harass - ment in chat rooms either publicly ( ie , with all of the other participants in the room ) or privately with some - one inviting the youth to a private “room . ” Chat rooms seem to be losing popularity among teenagers since 2000 ; in 2005 , 30 % of youth between the ages of 10 and 17 reported having been to a chat room in the previous year . 7 As noted by Wolak et al , “many youth describe chat rooms as unpleasant places attracting unsavory people , ” 7 ( p 7 ) suggesting that youth who visit chat rooms may not be representative of the rest of youth . “Instant messaging” ( IM ) is another real - time com - munication tool that allows 2 or more people who are using the same IM service to interact with each other in real time . Similar to chat rooms , to initiate a conversa - tion , senders type messages that appear real time in windows on the computer screens of both senders and receivers . In contrast to chat rooms , which are open to anyone , IM messages are sent through screen names , so the sender must know the screen name of the recipient to send the message . Some IM services have a member directory , where users can create proﬁles that can in - clude pictures and other information . These directories are searchable , and anyone with the same IM service can ﬁnd a person’s screen name and send them a message . Privacy settings can be set , however , to prevent mes - sages from unknown people . Thus , one’s privacy settings determine whether users can be contacted by strangers or only those who know them . Although more teenag - ers use e - mail , IMing is the Internet tool used most often to communicate with friends . 3 Indeed , an estimated 68 % of youth between the ages of 10 and 17 years of age used IM at least once in 2005 , as compared with 55 % in 2000 . 7 “Blogs” are online journals . People use them as dia - ries or to comment on speciﬁc topics . Blogs can include detailed descriptions of personal experiences and feel - ings . Some include contact information and many allow for readers to post responses , thus allowing for contact from both known and unknown people . Sixteen percent of youth between the ages of 10 and 17 years of age reported using a blog or online journal in 2005 . 7 “Social networking sites” integrate all of the commu - nication tools above . Users can create proﬁles that dis - play personal information and upload pictures and video similar to a blog . Communication can occur in real time using chat or IM capabilities or can be posted for users to read at their leisure , similar to e - mail or message boards . Proﬁles can be set to a private setting , thereby limiting access by unknown people or requiring a reader to know the person’s user name for them to send a message . Proﬁles also can be “public , ” thereby allowing anyone to send youth a message or view their proﬁle . Public pro - ﬁles also are searchable , which can allow anyone to identify people by searching on their name or other key words , such as town of residence . Some sites have user restrictions . For example , MySpace , the most popular social networking site , requires users to be at least 14 years of age , and proﬁles of youth under the age of 16 are automatically set to “private” so that they cannot be found with a general search . These communication tools are fast becoming a favorite among teenagers . A 2007 report by the Pew Internet and American Life Project 1 reveals that 55 % of youth 12 to 17 years of age use social networking sites . INTERNET VICTIMIZATION Recent research has highlighted the adolescent health issues represented by unwanted sexual solicitation and Internet harassment . 6 – 8 , 15 – 17 Unwanted sexual solicitation PEDIATRICS Volume 121 , Number 2 , February 2008 e351 by on April 20 , 2008 www . pediatrics . org Downloaded from occurs when youth are asked to engage in sexual talk or sexual behavior or to provide personal sexual informa - tion when they do not want to . An example from the Youth Internet Safety Survey - 2 7 is offered by a 15 - year - old boy : “A girl in her teens asked me to get naked on ‘cam’ but I just ignored her . ” Internet harassment is deﬁned by aggressive or embarrassing comments made to or posted about a youth online . As described by a 16 - year - old girl : “ Someone that I go to school with started spreading rumors about me by posting things in chat rooms and sending e - mails that were talking about me doing sexual things with all these different guys that were not true at all . I didn’t even know the guys . [ It happened ] because at one point I got mad and we had a confrontation . [ She ] was doing these things to get back at me—for revenge . ” Both types of online interpersonal victimization online are associated with emotional dis - tress and concurrent psychosocial problems , including depressive symptomatology and ofﬂine victimization ( eg , physical assault by peers ) . 6 – 8 , 15 – 17 Certainly , the pre - vention of these types of experiences is of great impor - tance . Whether recent suggestions to regulate or in other ways prevent youth from participating in social net - working sites are an important step in doing so has yet to be examined empirically . GAP IN THE LITERATURE Recent ﬁndings suggest that interpersonal victimization online similar to ofﬂine victimization , occurs within a conﬂuence of factors , including psychosocial problems , behavior problems online , and general Internet use characteristics . These ﬁndings also suggest that nuanced and complex analyses are appropriate when endeavor - ing to examine associated correlates . In this article , how - ever , we take a very simple , direct approach to examine whether social networking sites are related to increased risk for Internet victimization . We do so because we believe that underlying all of the policy and judicial initiatives , as well as media images and Internet safety messages targeted at parents , is a central , unanswered question : are social networking sites unhealthy for youth , as deﬁned by a place where Internet victimization is most likely to occur ? If they are not , the current messaging has the potential to distract parents and pro - fessionals working with youth from monitoring other , more concerning online behaviors . PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS The Growing up With Media Survey is a national survey of 1588 youth ages 10 to 15 years conducted August to September 2006 . 18 The survey protocol was reviewed and approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Institutional Review Board . The sample was obtained from the Harris Poll Online opt - in panel , 19 which is consistently comparable to data obtained from random telephone samples of the general populations when appropriate propensity and sample weights are applied . 20 – 23 Children were recruited through their par - ents who were members of the Harris Poll Online . Adults previously indicating having children in the household were randomly invited to participate , stratiﬁed by gen - der and age . Adults who responded to the invitation e - mail by clicking on a password - embedded link were taken to a Web site where eligibility was determined and informed consent obtained . Households were enrolled using a stratiﬁed random - sample design based on youth age and gender . After completing a brief survey , adults handed the survey to youth , who provided informed assent and completed their surveys . On average , adults took 5 minutes and youth took 21 minutes to complete their surveys . Youth received $ 15 gift certiﬁcates , and adults received $ 10 for participation . Random - digit dialing response rates typically seem higher than online response rates , because it is impossi - ble for online surveys to determine whether the e - mail has reached the intended recipient’s inbox ( as opposed to being ﬁltered out by spam ﬁlters ) and individuals who have not “picked up” their e - mail . The response rate for this online survey was calculated as the number of in - dividuals who started the survey divided by the number of e - mail invitations sent , less any e - mail invitations that were returned as undeliverable . The survey response rate , 26 % , is within the expected range of well - con - ducted online surveys . 24 , 25 Compared with the general US population of adults with children between the ages of 10 and 15 years , 26 households in the current survey were slightly more likely to report a postgraduate college degree and less likely to report Hispanic ethnicity and an household income of $ 75 000 or more ( Table 1 ) . Measures Two types of online interpersonal victimization were queried : unwanted sexual solicitation and Internet ha - rassment . Based on the Youth Internet Safety Sur - veys , 7 , 17 unwanted sexual solicitation was indicated if youth reported one of the following in the last year : ( 1 ) someone tried to get me to talk about sex online when I did not want to ; ( 2 ) someone online asked me for sexual information about myself when I did not want to tell the person ( eg , really personal questions , like what my body looks like or sexual things I have done ) ; or ( 3 ) someone asked me to do something sexual when I was online that I did not want to do . Internet harassment was indicated for youth who indicated in the last year that someone made a rude or mean comment to me online or someone spread rumors about me online , whether they were true or not . Youth also were asked whether anyone had made threatening or aggressive comments to them ; although this item is typically included in our deﬁnition of harassment , 27 , 28 it is not here because the follow - up question about where online the incident occurs was not programmed into the surveys . Youth reporting that any of these 5 online interper - sonal victimization experiences had happened to them were asked in follow - up “what they were doing” when the solicitations or harassments occurred . They were instructed to mark all of the activities that applied , in - cluding IM , chat rooms , social networking sites , e - mail , and online games . Categories were not exclusive and e352 YBARRA , MITCHELL by on April 20 , 2008 www . pediatrics . org Downloaded from reﬂected all of the different places where online youth were targeted in the previous year . Statistical Methods Data were weighted to reﬂect the population of adults with children ages 10 to 15 years old in the continental United States according to key demographic variables . 26 Then a propensity score weighting was applied . Propen - sity scores statistically adjust for respondents’ propensity to be online by comparing data on lifestyle factors with data collected on the same items from samples of ran - dom - digit dial telephone surveys . 18 , 21 , 29 , 30 Potential differ - ences in youth characteristics were tested for statistical signiﬁcance using the Pearson (cid:1) 2 statistic corrected for the survey design with Rao’s second - order correction converted into an F statistic . RESULTS All of the percentages reported in this section and dis - played in Tables 1 – 4 are weighted as described above . Numbers are unweighted and reﬂect the actual number of youth respondents . 31 As expected by survey design , half ( 48 % ) of the youth respondents were female ( Table 2 ) . Almost 1 ( 28 % ) in 3 youth were nonwhite . Seventeen percent of youth reported social networking sites as 1 of the 2 most TABLE 1 Sample Caregiver Demographic Characteristics Compared With National Population ( n (cid:1) 1588 ) Demographic Characteristic CPS 2005 , % UnweightedGuwMSample ( n (cid:2) 1588 ) , % Weighted GuwM Sample ( n (cid:2) 1588 ) , % EducationHighschool graduate or less 45 . 6 23 44 Some college 17 . 7 32 18 Associates degree 10 . 1 12 11 College 4 y 18 . 0 17 18 Postgraduate 8 . 6 16 9 Decline to answer NA (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) 1 Age according to gender , y a Male 28 – 39 15 . 1 6 12 Male 40 – 49 23 . 4 16 20 Male 50 – 55 5 . 9 13 5 Female 28 – 39 24 . 9 26 27 Female 40 – 49 25 . 9 24 31 Female 50 – 55 4 . 8 15 6 Race / ethnicity Hispanic 18 . 2 12 18 Black ( not Hispanic ) 11 . 9 12 12 All other ( not Hispanic ) 69 . 9 74 69 Decline to answer NA 1 1 RegionEast 21 . 2 25 20 South 31 . 6 29 32 Midwest 22 . 4 25 24 West 24 . 8 21 24 Household income $ 14999 or less 6 . 5 4 5 $ 15000 to $ 24999 7 . 7 8 7 $ 25000 to $ 34999 9 . 0 13 10 $ 35000 to $ 49999 14 . 1 15 14 $ 50000 to $ 74999 22 . 6 23 20 $ 75000 to $ 99999 15 . 9 14 16 $ 100000 or over 24 . 2 16 21 Decline to answer NA 7 7 Child in household 10 - to 12 - y - old male 23 . 8 25 24 10 - to 12 - y - old female 22 . 9 25 23 13 - to 15 - y - old male 28 . 3 25 28 13 - to 15 - y - old female 25 . 0 25 25 NAindicatesnotapplicable ; CPS , CurrentPopulationSurvey ; GuwM , GrowingupWithMedia .

PEDIATRICS Volume 121 , Number 2 , February 2008 e353 by on April 20 , 2008 www . pediatrics . org Downloaded from common activities that they engaged in when using the Internet . Fifteen percent of all of the youth reported being the target of unwanted sexual solicitation in the previous year . Thirty - four percent reported any of the three types of harassment queried ( Table 2 ) . Thirty - two and a half percent reported being targeted by either rude or mean comments or rumors online in the previous year . Due to a programming error , “threatening or aggressive” com - ments are not included in subsequent analyses . In both cases , signiﬁcantly more youth who reported that 1 of the 2 activities that they spent their most time online engaging in was IM , chat rooms , social networking sites , or playing games also reported online interpersonal vic - timization versus unaffected youth ( Table 3 ) . For exam - ple , compared with 31 % of youth who reported an unwanted sexual solicitation , 14 % of untargeted youth reported that social networking sites were 1 of their 2 most time - consuming activities online ( F ( 1 , 1584 ) (cid:2) 19 . 2 , P (cid:1) . 001 ) . An examination of locations online where youth re - ported online interpersonal victimization occurring ( Ta - ble 4 ) suggested an incomplete overlap with online ac - tivities most commonly reported by youth . For example , chat rooms were one of the least frequently cited activ - ities youth who were solicited and harassed reported engaging in frequently ( Table 3 ) yet chat rooms were one of the most commonly cited places where interper - sonal victimizations occurred ( Table 4 ) . Four percent ( n (cid:2) 66 ) of all of the youth reported an unwanted sexual solicitation on a social networking site . Among those who were targeted , Table 4 shows where online incidents were most commonly reported . Youth reporting unwanted solicitations in social net - working sites were signiﬁcantly more likely to be female ( 80 % ) than those solicited elsewhere ( 53 % ; F ( 1 , 1584 ) (cid:2) 6 . 7 , P (cid:2) . 01 ) . On the other hand , they were equally likely to report being targeted monthly or more often ( 29 % ) compared with youth solicited other places on - line ( 21 % ; F ( 1 , 584 ) (cid:2) 0 . 7 , P (cid:2) . 40 ) and were of similar ages ( solicited on social networking sites : 13 . 5 years ; solicited elsewhere : 13 . 4 years ; F ( 1 , 1584 ) (cid:2) . 04 , P (cid:2) . 85 ) . One ( 9 % n (cid:2) 130 ) in 10 youth reported being ha - rassed on a social networking site . Table 4 shows where youth reported being harassed among those who were targeted . As with unwanted sexual solicitation , youth reporting harassment on social networking sites were signiﬁcantly more likely to be female ( 66 % ) than those harassed elsewhere ( 48 % ; F ( 1 , 1584 ) (cid:2) 5 . 8 , P (cid:2) . 02 ) . They were equally likely to report being targeted monthly or more often ( 23 % ) than youth who were targeted elsewhere ( 23 % ; F ( 1584 ) (cid:2) . 002 , P (cid:2) . 97 ) . In contrast to solicitation , youth who were harassed in social networking sites were slightly but signiﬁcantly older on average ( 13 . 8 years ) than youth harassed other places online ( 13 . 1 years ; F ( 1 , 1584 ) (cid:2) 14 . 9 , P (cid:1) . 001 ) .

An important gap in this effort is an evaluation of victimization risk that social networking sites may pose to youth . With parents , politicians , law enforcement , and other professionals working with youth looking for answers , this study examines the relative report of on - line interpersonal victimization in social networking sites . Based on national data from 1588 youth between the ages of 10 and 15 years , our ﬁndings suggest that online interpersonal victimizations do not seem to occur to any greater degree and , in fact , seem to occur to a lesser degree in social networking sites than other places online where youth communicate with others . It should be noted that respondents in this survey are under the age of 16 years , exactly the group that is being focused on in legislative and litigious initiatives . Findings suggest that targeting social networking sites speciﬁcally may not be the best method of reducing the prevalence of online interpersonal victimization of children and younger adolescents . How Often Does It Actually Happen in Social Networking Sites ? Our ﬁndings suggest that 15 % of all youth report being targeted by unwanted sexual solicitation , 4 % in a social networking site speciﬁcally . Similarly , 32 . 5 % of youth report being harassed , either by threats or aggressive comments , or having rumors spread about them ; 9 % report being harassed while on a social networking site speciﬁcally . Youth are less likely to be targeted for un - wanted sexual solicitation in social networking sites than they are through IM and in chat rooms , however , and are less likely to be a target of harassment on social networking sites than they are through IM . The majority of IM sessions are opt - in conversations with people the youth know . Previous research suggests that many online interpersonal victimizations are perpe - trated by peers , 7 , 17 which is perhaps why the most com - mon place online where incidents occur is through IM . Given observations that talk of sex in unmonitored teen chat rooms is common , 14 it is unsurprising that sexual solicitations are commonly reported in chat rooms among targeted youth . Anyone can speak with anyone else who is in a public chat room . It is possible that these events occur between youth who are age - appropriately curious about sex 32 , 33 but lose control of the conversa - tion . It is important to understand that the Internet , like any environment , is complex and is made up of many different contexts . Youth are more or less likely to be targeted by someone they know or for speciﬁc types of victimization based on the context , but also based on their behavior . Professionals working to reduce youth victimization online would likely have a bigger impact if they focused on youth behavior rather than regulating speciﬁc contexts . Frequent incidents ( ie , monthly or more often ) of other unwanted sexual solicitation or harassment are equally likely to be reported on social networking sites as compared with all other places online . It is possible that the incidents are somehow different in nature , when a different measure is used ( eg , likelihood of inducing distress ) . However , at least in terms of intensity , inci - dents on social networking sites seem similar to other places online and , therefore , may be equally as serious or benign as other places . Girls are signiﬁcantly more likely than boys to report unwanted sexual solicitation and harassment episodes on social networking sites than all other places online . Harassment is more frequently reported by older youth on social networking sites compared with all other places , although no age differences were noted for un - wanted sexual solicitation . These noted differences are likely in part because older girls are more likely to have an online proﬁle , 1 and they are more likely to be tar - geted for unwanted sexual solicitation generally . 8 , 16 Older youth are more likely to have online proﬁles 1 and to be engaged in Internet harassment generally . 6 , 15 From a prevention and intervention perspective , social net - working sites seem to be effective places to reach older girls who may be demonstrating risky behaviors either in social networking sites as well as other places online . Previous research suggests that youth who have ever used IM and chat rooms in the last year are signiﬁcantly more likely to also report online interpersonal victimiza - tion , 6 – 7 , 15 – 17 and 1 recent national survey suggests that the general use of social networking sites is related to being harassed . 34 The current research supports these ﬁndings ( Table 3 ) but also highlights the importance of identifying where exactly online the victimization oc - curred ( Table 4 ) . Challenging Assumptions With Data Over and over , our assumptions about online interper - sonal victimization do not seem consistent with emerg - ing data . We assumed that the majority of sex crimes that originated online were perpetrated by adults who were deceptive about their true identity , including their age and sexual intentions . This portrayal is not consis - tent with the data , however . 35 Research suggests that , in the majority of cases referred to law enforcement ( 95 % ) , adult offenders are honest about being an adult , and in 79 % of the cases , they are honest about their intentions to have sex with the youth . 36 , 37 Moreover , among youth who meet their offender ofﬂine , 3 ( 73 % ) in 4 do so more than once . These characteristics describe a crime differ - ent from that typically assumed to be the stereotypical sex crime and one that requires a different approach to prevention and intervention . Similarly , we assumed that the conﬂuence of opportunities to share personal infor - mation , meet new people , and search for personal char - acteristics offered in social networking sites would create a particularly risky place for youth to be . The current ﬁndings suggest that this is not true and that prevention approaches might need to be repositioned . These data , along with other emerging research , highlight the im - portance of using data to inform prevention and safety measures . Limitations The current ﬁndings are the ﬁrst to examine the com - parative report of unwanted sexual solicitation and ha - PEDIATRICS Volume 121 , Number 2 , February 2008 e355 by on April 20 , 2008 www . pediatrics . org Downloaded from rassment occurring in social networking sites versus all of the other places youth visit online . However , ﬁndings should be examined within the conﬁnes of the limita - tions of the data . First , there are many underlying char - acteristics that would further illuminate frequencies of victimization reported here . For example , incidents that occur in environments where one’s identity is more easily hidden may be of a different quality than that occurring in environments where the person is required to have the user’s proﬁle name to communicate with him or her . Furthermore , it is possible that the use of privacy controls in places where they can be enacted ( eg , social networking sites ) may discriminate between tar - geted and untargeted youth . On the other hand , those who “friend” everyone may be more likely targeted . Future research should examine whether there are youth characteristics ( eg , emotional bond with caregiver or loneliness ) that increase the likelihood of engaging in self - protective ( eg , limiting proﬁle to known friends only ) or risk behaviors ( eg , talking about sex to un - known individuals ) online . Our measure of unwanted sexual solicitation does not discriminate between those incidents that do and do not progress further into an ofﬂine sex crime . It is possible that frequency of location online where these incidents occur may be different for these more serious incidents . Implications Pediatricians and Other Health Providers Current ﬁndings serve as a call to pediatricians to advo - cate for thoughtful and useful legislation that has the possibility of truly protecting the health and well being of youth . Social networking sites do not seem to increase one’s likelihood of unwanted sexual solicitation or In - ternet harassment over and above other places online . Time and money spent on proposed legislation and legal action aimed at these sites may have a greater impact if they are focused on other areas of prevention , such as funding for online youth outreach programs , school an - tibullying programs , and online mental health services . Pediatricians also should educate parents and children about what does ( and does not ) increase the likelihood of online interpersonal victimization , including an ad - monition to parents to not just focus on their child’s social networking site activity . They should help parents understand that it is less the technology and more a child’s psychosocial proﬁle and general online behavior ( eg , harassing others , meeting people in multiple differ - ent ways online , and talking with people known only online about sex 35 ) that is inﬂuential in explaining the likelihood of online interpersonal victimization . Parents Findings suggest that parents should not focus speciﬁ - cally on their children’s use of social networking sites exclusive to other activities online . They should instead be aware of with whom , where , and about what topics their children are talking online . It is not the Internet or a speciﬁc place online , per se , but rather online behav - iors and psychosocial problems that are most inﬂuential in explaining the likelihood of online interpersonal vic - timization . 38 Internet Operators One quarter of youth between the ages of 10 and 15 years reporting an unwanted sexual solicitation indicate that (cid:2) 1 incident occurred on a social networking site . This is a large enough percentage to suggest that Internet safety measures enacted on social networking sites could reduce the frequency of unwanted sexual solicitation online . An even larger impact might be realized through efforts aimed at improving Internet safety policies and youth behaviors on IM and in chat rooms as well ; mea - sures aimed at e - mail content and online gaming sites could also have an effect . All of the sites where people interact with each other online should allow users to control access to their personal information , as well as provide intuitive ways to stop and report any unwanted interaction quickly . For example , FaceBook and MySpace allow users to set their proﬁle to “private” to limit access to their information , and data suggest that most youth are engaging in self - protective activities ( an estimated 66 % of youth with online proﬁles limit access to it ) . 1 There should be an easy tutorial to educate users who are not enacting self - protective measures on how to do so . Going Beyond Sexual Predation More than twice as many youth in the survey report being harassed ( 32 . 5 % ) versus being solicited ( 15 % ) both on the Internet as a whole , as well as in social networking sites speciﬁcally . Internet education mes - sages should expand their focus to include harm reduc - tion messages about Internet harassment . CONCLUSIONS The majority of youth who are online are not targeted for unwanted sexual solicitation or Internet harassment , and the majority of youth who are targeted do not report it occurring in a social networking site . Thoughtful ap - proaches to prevention that focus on children’s behav - iors online ( eg , harassing others ) and their general psychosocial proﬁle ( eg , aggression problems or depres - sive symptomatology ) instead of particular technologies ( which will continue to evolve into new and more in - teractive applications ) are needed . Policy proposals that aim to reduce the vulnerability of youth to sexual vic - timization online should focus not on restricting access to certain types of online communication tools but in - stead on mental health interventions for vulnerable youth and Internet safety education that apply to all types of online communications .
