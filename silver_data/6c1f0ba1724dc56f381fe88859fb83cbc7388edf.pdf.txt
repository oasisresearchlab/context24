Feigenson * Section of Biochemistry , Molecular and Cell Biology , Cornell University , 201 Biotechnology Building , Ithaca , NY 14853 , USA Received 9 October 1998 ; received in revised form 21 December 1998 ; accepted 21 December 1998 Abstract In any lipid bilayer membrane , there is an upper limit on the cholesterol concentration that can be accommodated within the bilayer structure ; excess cholesterol will precipitate as crystals of pure cholesterol monohydrate . This cholesterol solubility limit is a well - defined quantity . It is a first - order phase boundary in the phospholipid / cholesterol phase diagram . There are many different solubility limits in the literature , but no clear picture has emerged that can unify the disparate results . We have studied the effects that different sample preparation methods can have on the apparent experimental solubility limit . We find that artifactual demixing of cholesterol can occur during conventional sample preparation and that this demixed cholesterol may produce artifactual cholesterol crystals . Therefore , phospholipid / cholesterol suspensions which are prepared by conventional methods may manifest variable , falsely low cholesterol solubility limits . We have developed two novel preparative methods which are specifically designed to prevent demixing during sample preparation . For detection of the cholesterol crystals , X - ray diffraction has proven to be quantitative and highly sensitive . Experiments based on these methods yield reproducible and precise cholesterol solubility limits : 66 mol % for phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) bilayers and 51 mol % for phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) bilayers . We present evidence that these are true , equilibrium values . In contrast to the dramatic headgroup effect ( PC vs . PE ) , acyl chain variations had no effect on the cholesterol solubility limit in four different PC / cholesterol mixtures . (cid:223) 1999 Elsevier Science B . V . All rights reserved .

Introduction Most eukaryotic cells contain membrane sterols and all vertebrates synthesize cholesterol [ 1 ] . In mammalian cells , as much as 90 % of all cholesterol can be found in the plasma membrane [ 2 ] . Estimates of the cholesterol content in animal cell plasma mem - branes have ranged between 25 mol % and 50 mol % [ 1 ] , implying that the interactions between cholesterol and other membrane components ( including other cholesterols ) might play a central role in establishing the properties of the membrane . Because pure cholesterol cannot form a bilayer , there must be an upper limit on the cholesterol con - centration that can be accommodated within any phospholipid bilayer . Any excess cholesterol will tend to precipitate from the membrane as crystals of pure cholesterol monohydrate . This cholesterol solubility limit is a well - de¢ned quantity : a ¢rst - order phase boundary in the phospholipid / cholester - 0005 - 2736 / 99 / $ ^ see front matter (cid:223) 1999 Elsevier Science B .

Determining this limit for a systematic series of phospholipid / choles - terol mixtures would inform studies on the nature of phospholipid ^ cholesterol interactions . Many re - searchers have sought to measure this solubility limit in a number of model systems [ 3 ^ 12 ] and though there is no shortage of published work on the sub - ject , no clear picture has emerged which can unify the disparate observations . In principle , this solubility limit should be straight - forward to determine : bilayer suspensions of increas - ing cholesterol content are prepared and each sample examined to determine the critical mole fraction of cholesterol at which crystals begin to form . In the initial stages of this study , we found that several methods ( e . g . , 90‡ light scattering , X - ray di¡raction , ultra¢ltration ) could be used e¡ectively to determine the point at which cholesterol crystals appear in dif - ferent phospholipid mixtures . But regardless of which detection method we used , it became clear that the reproducibility of these ‘straightforward’ sol - ubility limits was surprisingly poor . We were gradu - ally forced to conclude that the source of this varia - bility was heterogeneity in the samples themselves , caused by demixing between components during sample preparation . Indeed , Davis has reported dif - ¢culty in preparing homogeneous suspensions of phospholipid / cholesterol mixtures [ 13 ] , and it has long been suggested that artifacts arising from sam - ple preparation could explain the confusion which surrounds cholesterol solubility limits in bilayers [ 6 , 7 ] . In this study , we report the determination of sol - ubility limits for four di¡erent phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) / cholesterol mixtures and one phosphatidyletha - nolamine ( PE ) / cholesterol mixture . For all of the PC / cholesterol mixtures , these solubility limits are essen - tially indistinguishable , falling near 66 mol % choles - terol . In stark contrast , the cholesterol solubility lim - it in a phosphatidylethanolamine bilayer is only about 51 mol % . We will present evidence that these are the true , equilibrium solubility limits for choles - terol in each of these bilayers . Phospholipid / choles - terol demixing artifacts , which can obscure the true solubility limit in conventionally prepared samples , will be discussed as will two independent preparative methods which we have developed to avoid these artifacts . 2 . Materials and methods Phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , AL ) , cholesterol from Nu Chek Prep ( Elysian , MN ) . Purity ( s 99 % ) was con¢rmed by thin layer chromatography on washed , activat - ed silica gel plates ( Alltech Associates , Deer¢eld , IL ) , developing with chloroform / methanol / water = 65 : 25 : 4 for phospholipid analysis or with petroleum ether / ethyl ether / chloroform = 7 : 3 : 3 for cholesterol analysis . All solvents used were of HPLC grade . TLC plates were quantitated by charring and densi - tometry . Phospholipid stock solutions were quanti - tated by phosphate assay [ 14 ] . Aqueous bu¡er ( pH 7 . 0 , 5 mM PIPES , 200 mM KCl ) was prepared from puri¢ed water ( Milli - Q system , Millipore ) and ¢l - tered through a 0 . 1 W m ¢lter before use . FEP Te£on Oak Ridge centrifuge tubes were purchased from Nalge Company . One - mm , special glass X - ray capil - laries were purchased from Charles Supper ( Natick , MA ) . 2 . 1 . Liposome preparations 2 . 1 . 1 . Film deposition Components were codissolved in CHCl 3 and bulk solvent removed under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas , depositing a lipid ¢lm on the surface of a test tube . Any remaining solvent residue was removed by vacuum incubation for V 10 h at a measured pres - sure of V 30 mTorr . Deposited ¢lms were hydrated in aqueous bu¡er at room temperature and dispersed by vortexing for 1 min . Samples containing di16 : 0 - PC were hydrated and vortexed at 50‡C , before being cooled slowly to room temperature . All samples were sealed under argon after hydration . 2 . 1 . 2 . Lyophilization Components were codissolved in cyclohexane / methanol , 99 : 1 , and this solution was frozen in liquid nitrogen . The sample was placed in a vacuum desic - cator on water ice and bulk solvent was removed by sublimation under vacuum . After bulk solvent had been removed , the desiccator was warmed to room temperature and the vacuum incubation was contin - ued for V 10 h at V 30 mTorr . The voluminous lipid powders were hydrated , vortexed and sealed under argon in the same manner as the ¢lms . BBAMEM 77560 1 - 2 - 99 J .

Brie£y , lipids were codissolved in 10 ^ 100 W l of dichloromethane ( 0 . 1 % MeOH , 0 . 05 % H 2 O ) and then sprayed into vortexing bu¡er at re - duced pressure , rapidly vaporizing the solvent and precipitating the lipid mixture in an aqueous environ - ment . For sample preparation of mixtures containing di16 : 0 - PC , the bu¡er was maintained at 50‡C throughout the RSE procedure , before cooling to room temperature . All samples were sealed under argon immediately following RSE . 2 . 1 . 4 . Low - temperature trapping ( LTT ) This method will soon be described in detail else - where ( Huang and Feigenson , in preparation ) . Lipids were dissolved in CHCl 3 and the solvent removed under vacuum at V 30 mTorr for V 10 h . Lipids were re - dissolved in dry chloroform containing 1 % methanol , then frozen in liquid nitrogen . Samples were lyophilized at low temperature , carefully con - trolling the temperature so that the chloroform re - mains solid . After bulk solvent had been removed , the lipid powders were kept cool ( 3 20‡C ) during continued vacuum incubation ( V 12 h ) to remove residual solvent . Just before hydration , the sample was warmed to room temperature in a stirring water bath for 1 min , then bu¡er added to the dry powder . The suspension was immediately vortexed for 1 min . Samples containing di16 : 0 - PC were hydrated and vortexed at 50‡C . All samples were sealed under ar - gon following hydration . 2 . 2 . Cholesterol crystal detection The measurements described below were all made at room temperature ( 23 ^ 25‡C ) . 2 . 2 . 1 . Optical microscopy Optical microscopy was used to detect cholesterol crystals in lipid dispersions . A Zeiss IM35 micro - scope was used in either phase - contrast , bright¢eld , or polarized mode . A Nikon Fluor 100 U and a 40 U oil immersion objective were used . Typically , 10 W l of a 3 - mM lipid dispersion was viewed on a thin cover - glass . Images were captured and enhanced by a Dage MTI CCD - 72 camera ( Dage MTI , IN ) and viewed on a video monitor . 2 . 2 . 2 . Light scattering Ninety - degree light scattering was measured using a Hitachi £uorescence spectrophotometer ( model F - 3010 ) interfaced to a Macintosh computer . Samples were illuminated at 500 nm ( 1 . 5 - mm slit ; 500 - nm interference ¢lter ) with detection at 500 nm ( 1 . 5 - mm slit ) . About 1 . 5 ml of a 100 W M suspension was added to a cuvette with a masked stirbar . Scat - tered light intensity was averaged over 1 min . 2 . 2 . 3 . X - Ray di¡raction Hydrated liposome dispersions made by ¢lm dep - osition , lyophilization , or LTT were ¢rst pelleted at 1000 U g for 10 ^ 25 min ; dispersions made by RSE were pelleted at 20 000 U g for 15 min . The lipid sedi - ment was loaded into thin - walled 1 . 0 mm glass X - ray capillaries and further centrifuged in a buoyant sup - port apparatus [ 15 ] at 20 000 U g for 15 min to pro - duce a uniformly dense pellet . Typically , white lipid sediment ¢lled the bottom 4 ^ 8 mm of the capillary , with clear bu¡er above . Capillaries were sealed by para⁄n wax under argon gas . A typical sample con - tained about 1 . 5 mg of lipid . X - Ray di¡raction experiments were carried out at the A - 1 and F - 1 beamlines at the Macromolecular Di¡raction Facility at the Cornell High Energy Syn - chrotron Source ( MacCHESS ) . Samples were illumi - nated by an intense synchrotron X - ray beam , with a wavelength of 0 . 908 A(cid:238) , passing through a 0 . 2 - mm collimator . Di¡raction images were collected with a Princeton 2K CCD detector containing 2048 U 2048 41 - W m pixels [ 16 , 17 ] . At the sample - to - detector dis - tance of 280 mm , the wide dynamic range ( 16 bits ) and the resolution of the CCD detector allowed cap - ture of both the low - angle and wide - angle di¡raction patterns ( from 3 . 8 A(cid:238) to 110 A(cid:238) ) simultaneously on the same image . Depending on beam intensity and sam - ple density , the exposure time for hydrated samples varied from 10 to 80 s ; for dry samples , 0 . 5 to 3 . 0 s . Capillaries were mounted in a sample holder coupled to a computer - controlled stepping - motor stage which could move vertically or horizontally , perpendicular to the beam . Samples were scanned 2 ^ 3 mm along the capillary axis during exposure , using the stepping motor . This procedure reduces radiation damage to the lipid and achieves more rep - resentative sampling . Image ¢les were corrected for geometric distor - BBAMEM 77560 1 - 2 - 99 J . Huang et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1417 ( 1999 ) 89 ^ 100 91 tions introduced by the CCD camera . To transform the powder patterns into radial pro¢les of di¡raction intensity , each image was circularly integrated ( using the IMP program [ 18 ] provided by CHESS ) . The center of the beam and the tilt angle of the detector surface were precisely determined to prevent line broadening . Di¡raction peaks in Bragg spacing were calibrated using the Ca ( PS ) 2 line at 49 . 1 A(cid:238) as a standard [ 19 ] . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Detection methods We use the term M (cid:3) chol to refer to the critical bilayer mole fraction of cholesterol above which excess cho - lesterol precipitates as the monohydrate crystal . A variety of methods were used to determine this sol - ubility limit ; three of these are discussed below . 3 . 1 . 1 . Light microscopy The advantage of light microscopy is that choles - terol crystals and lipid vesicles can be identi¢ed by direct , visual observation . Each sample in a series is searched for crystals of cholesterol monohydrate , try - ing to determine the mole fraction of cholesterol above which cholesterol crystals are present . As a method for the determination of M (cid:3) chol , light micro - scopy was imperfect for three reasons . First , optical microscopy does not resolve crystals on a scale much smaller than 1 W m . Second , the quantity of crystals cannot be reliably estimated , due to variations in crystal size and thickness . Third , the nature of such a visual search makes it possible that cholesterol crystals will be missed in samples near M (cid:3) chol , even if multiple sample aliquots are examined . Therefore , light microscopy serves best as a supporting techni - que . Cholesterol crystals were identi¢ed mainly by their shape using bright¢eld microscopy . Although choles - terol crystals have strong birefringence , polarized light microscopy was not very useful for our pur - pose . In samples of cholesterol content just above M (cid:3) chol , the number and sizes of crystals are usually small . Rotation of polarized light by crystals was very weak in these samples , whereas birefringence from the plentiful lipid vesicles overwhelmed the ¢eld of view . 3 . 1 . 2 . 90‡ Light scattering Determination of M (cid:3) chol by 90‡ light scattering ex - ploits the di¡erences in size , structure and refractive index between cholesterol crystals and bilayer vesicles . For many phospholipid / cholesterol mix - tures , a sudden increase in signal intensity correlates with the appearance of cholesterol crystals by X - ray di¡raction ( data not shown ) . However , this method Fig . 1 . X - Ray di¡raction powder patterns for two di12 : 0 - PC / cholesterol mixtures prepared by LTT : ( a ) with M chol = 0 . 60 , only lipid la - mellar di¡raction is detected ; ( b ) with M chol = 0 . 73 , di¡raction from lipid lamellae as well as from cholesterol monohydrate crystals is detected . BBAMEM 77560 1 - 2 - 99 J . Huang et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1417 ( 1999 ) 89 ^ 100 92 does not work well with all preparations . We found that light scattering did not reveal M (cid:3) chol in mixtures of cholesterol with 16 : 0 , 18 : 1 - PE . 3 . 1 . 3 . X - Ray di¡raction Fig . 1a shows an X - ray di¡raction powder pattern for a di12 : 0 - PC / cholesterol mixture with M chol = 0 . 60 . The two , low - angle concentric rings are the ¢rst - and the second - order lamellar repeats . The radial pro¢le of di¡raction intensity is shown in Fig . 2a ; the peaks at 58 . 6 A(cid:238) and 29 . 3 A(cid:238) correspond to the ¢rst - and second - order lamellar repeats , respectively . The wide - angle data reveal a broad , di¡use peak centered at 4 . 85 A(cid:238) , as shown in Fig . 2b . Fig . 1b shows the powder pattern obtained for a di12 : 0 - PC / cholesterol mixture with M chol = 0 . 73 . The cholesterol composition in this sample exceeds the maximum solubility of cholesterol in a di12 : 0 - PC bilayer ( see below ) . Therefore , in addition to lamellar phase lipid , this sample also shows the di¡raction pattern characteristic of cholesterol monohydrate crystals [ 20 , 21 ] . The radial pro¢le of di¡raction in - tensity is shown in Fig . 2c . Peaks correspond to the main cholesterol monohydrate repeat at 33 . 94A(cid:238) ( ¢rst - order ) and 16 . 97 A(cid:238) ( second - order ) . Hereafter , we will refer to these as the 34 A(cid:238) and 17 A(cid:238) peaks . In the wide - angle region ( Fig . 2d ) , a number of sharp peaks are evident which are characteristic of choles - terol monohydrate , at spacings between 4 and 6 A(cid:238) . A broad 4 . 85 A(cid:238) peak , caused by lateral order within the bilayer ( Fig . 2b ) , gradually weakens and disappears with increasing cholesterol crystal content . This would seem to indicate that accumulation of choles - terol crystals can somehow disrupt lateral packing within the bilayer . An advantage of the X - ray di¡raction detection method is that it yields separate , characteristic sig - nals for lamellar phase lipid and cholesterol mono - hydrate . This also allows a quantitative measure of the amount of crystalline cholesterol in a sample , once a radial pro¢le of di¡raction intensity has been produced from the powder pattern . As Fig . 2c Fig . 2 . Radial pro¢les of di¡raction intensity for the mixtures shown in Fig . 1 .

Huang et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1417 ( 1999 ) 89 ^ 100 93 shows , the quantity of cholesterol crystals can be assessed through integration of either the 34 A(cid:238) , the 17 A(cid:238) , or the wide - angle peaks between 4 and 6 A(cid:238) . Although the 34 A(cid:238) peak is the strongest , it often overlaps with the second - order lamellar - repeat peak . Therefore , we generally use the 17 A(cid:238) peak as the quantitative indicator . This peak is sharp and the local background is relatively smooth and £at . We de¢ne the cholesterol crystal di¡raction intensity I c as I c (cid:136) (cid:137) I a (cid:133) 16 : 5 (cid:23)A ; 17 : 5 (cid:23)A (cid:134) 3 I baseline (cid:138) = I beam (cid:133) 1 (cid:134) where I a ( A , B ) is the average di¡raction intensity between A and B in Bragg spacing , I baseline is the background intensity near the 17 A(cid:238) peak I baseline (cid:136) (cid:137) I a (cid:133) 16 : 0 (cid:23)A ; 16 : 5 (cid:23)A (cid:134) (cid:135) I a (cid:133) 17 : 5 (cid:23)A ; 18 (cid:23)A (cid:134)(cid:138) = 2 (cid:133) 2 (cid:134) and I beam is an exposure factor I beam (cid:136) I a (cid:133) 90 (cid:23)A ; 100 (cid:23)A (cid:134) (cid:133) 3 (cid:134) The major sources of noise in I c were from nonrep - resentative sampling and inconsistent sample density . The signal - to - noise ratio was signi¢cantly improved by scanning the samples during exposure , and by pelleting samples in the capillaries with high speed centrifugation . 3 . 2 . Sample preparation and equilibrium 3 . 2 . 1 . Variable results by two conventional preparation methods In sets of samples prepared by either ¢lm deposi - tion or lyophilization , each individual experiment yielded an apparent M (cid:3) chol value . Unfortunately , the reproducibility between experiments was surprisingly poor ( Table 1 ) , and this variability far exceeded the uncertainty in the experimental measurements . For example , 26 separate experiments were performed on 16 : 0 , 18 : 1 - PC / cholesterol mixtures prepared by lyophilization , and the apparent M (cid:3) chol values ranged from 51 ^ 65 mol % cholesterol . 3 . 2 . 2 . Artifactual cholesterol demixing Fig . 3 shows the radial pro¢le of di¡raction inten - sity of a 16 : 0 , 18 : 1 - PC / cholesterol deposited ¢lm , at M chol = 0 . 60 , on a semi - logarithmic scale . This pattern shows a set of lamellar repeats together with a set of peaks which correspond to anhydrous cholesterol crystals [ 22 ] . This con¢rms that some cholesterol has demixed from the phospholipid , forming crystals of pure cholesterol . Fig . 4 shows the 17 A(cid:238) di¡raction intensity due to anhydrous cholesterol crystals as a function of cholesterol content for a set of 16 : 0 , 18 : 1 - PC / cholesterol deposited ¢lms . In this set of samples , anhydrous cholesterol crystals are present in every sample for which M chol s 0 . 45 .

The dispersions were incubated at room temperature for 7 days , with 2 min of vortexing each day , before being transferred to capillaries and subjected to Fig . 3 .

Although the true , equilibrium M (cid:3) chol value is 0 . 66 ( see Section 4 ) , cholesterol crystals were detected in samples with M chol as low as 0 . 51 . The same samples were examined again after incu - bating them at room temperature for 10 weeks fur - ther . As shown in Fig . 5 ( crosses ) , cholesterol crystal levels were slightly reduced , indicating that some cholesterol from the crystals had remixed with the lamellar phase lipid . Therefore , we sought to deter - mine whether mechanical stirring or heating might accelerate remixing . Two identical sets of 16 : 0 , 18 : 1 - PC / cholesterol dispersions were prepared by lyophi - lization and examined by light microscopy . Initially , the apparent M (cid:3) chol value was 0 . 52 for each set . The sample sets were then incubated under argon , at ei - ther 24‡C or 45‡C , with each sample constantly agi - tated by a small stirbar . Samples were £ushed with argon and resealed every 3 days . After 1 month of incubation , the sample sets were re - examined by light microscopy . The apparent M (cid:3) chol values had increased to about 0 . 57 or 0 . 60 for the sample sets incubated at 24‡C and 45‡C , respectively . The lipid was extracted and examined by TLC , and no signi¢cant breakdown was found . Although the majority of anhydrous cholesterol crystals were converted to monohydrate crystals after hydration , traces of anhydrous crystals were found in many of the mixtures prepared by ¢lm deposition or lyophilization , days after hydration .

Reproducible solubility limits by novel preparative methods Table 2 summarizes the results obtained in experi - ments based on the RSE and LTT methods of sam - ple preparation . Each M (cid:3) chol value listed in this table is the result of at least three replicate experiments by each preparative method . In contrast to the results obtained by either ¢lm deposition or lyophilization , experiments based on RSE or LTT yield reproduci - ble values of M (cid:3) chol which are , in every case , higher than the apparent M (cid:3) chol values in conventional prep - arations ( Table 1 cf . Table 2 ) . For every phospholip - id / cholesterol mixture which we have examined so far , the same M (cid:3) chol value is obtained by both RSE and LTT . Sample sets prepared by RSE and LTT showed no change in the apparent solubility limit even over V 10 weeks of incubation ( Fig . 7a ) . 3 . 3 . M (cid:3) chol Values for PC or PE bilayers Simply exchanging the PC headgroup for a PE headgroup has a dramatic e¡ect on the solubility limit , as shown in Fig . 7b . Cholesterol precipitates from bilayers of 16 : 0 , 18 : 1 - PE at a cholesterol con - centration 15 mol % lower than in bilayers of the PC analog . For the 16 : 0 , 18 : 1 - PE bilayer , M (cid:3) chol = 0 . 51 ( (cid:254) 0 . 01 ) . In contrast to the dramatic headgroup depend - ence , the cholesterol solubility limit in a PC bilayer seems to be insensitive to either increases or de - creases in bilayer thickness , as revealed by cholester - ol mixtures with di22 : 1 - PC ( Fig . 7c ) or di12 : 0 - PC ( Fig . 7d ) . For each of these two bilayers , M (cid:3) chol = 0 . 66 ( (cid:254) 0 . 01 ) . The quantitative plots of crystal di¡raction intensity were always more noisy for di22 : 1 - PC / cholesterol mixtures than for other mix - tures ( Fig . 7c cf . Fig . 7a , b , d , e ) . This may be due to physical separation between lamellae and crystals during centrifugation , caused by the considerable density di¡erence between cholesterol monohydrate and di22 : 1 - PC vesicles . However , in every experi - ment on di22 : 1 - PC / cholesterol , cholesterol mono - hydrate was only present in samples with M (cid:3) chol s 0 . 66 . Unlike the three other PCs discussed so far , di16 : 0 - PC forms gel - phase lamellae at room temper - ature . Nonetheless , at 24‡C ( Fig . 7e ) , the solubility limit of cholesterol in a di16 : 0 - PC bilayer is indistin - guishable from those observed in the other three PC mixtures : M chol = 0 . 66 ( (cid:254) 0 . 01 ) . 4 . Discussion The method of sample preparation is critical to the successful determination of true , equilibrium choles - terol solubility limits in phospholipid / cholesterol sus - pensions . Experiments based on either of two con - ventional preparative methods , ¢lm deposition or lyophilization , can produce apparent solubility limits which are not reproducible ( Table 1 ) . Both ¢lm dep - osition and lyophilization pass the phospholipid / cho - lesterol mixture through an intermediary solid state , either ¢lm or powder . Freeman and Finean reported that cholesterol crystals tend to precipitate from de - posited ¢lms of egg PC and cholesterol [ 6 ] . Other workers have also observed the formation of pure cholesterol crystals in anhydrous lipid mixtures [ 23 , 24 ] . We have observed this phenomenon in sev - eral phospholipid mixtures , both in deposited ¢lms ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) and lyophilized powders ( data not shown ) . X - Ray di¡raction identi¢es these cholesterol precipitates as crystals of anhydrous cholesterol , based on the characteristic di¡raction lines , e . g . , in the 7 ^ 11 A(cid:238) region . Buboltz has proposed that the e¡ects of solid - state demixing could persist in hy - drated samples [ 15 ] . Indeed , after hydration , this demixed cholesterol is very slow to remix ( Fig . 5 ) and transforms slowly to crystals of cholesterol monohydrate . Neither mechanical agitation nor heat - ing , over several weeks’ time , can bring about com - plete remixing of these artifactual crystals . The fact that the cholesterol crystals have some tendency to remix with the lamellar phase ( Fig . 5 ) demonstrates that these samples are not at equilibrium , and that the true equilibrium value of M (cid:3) chol is higher than the apparent M (cid:3) chol . Overall , solid - state demixing of cho - lesterol during conventional sample preparation has the e¡ect of producing variable , falsely low estimates of the cholesterol solubility limit . This may help to BBAMEM 77560 1 - 2 - 99 J . Huang et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1417 ( 1999 ) 89 ^ 100 97 explain the disparate M (cid:3) chol results that have been pub - lished in the literature [ 3 ^ 12 ] . The evidence we have presented demonstrates that phospholipid / cholesterol samples may not be at equi - librium when they are prepared by either ¢lm depo - sition or lyophilization . We have shown that non - equilibrium cholesterol crystals ( both monohydrate and anhydrous ) can be present in samples well below M (cid:3) chol . These particles of pure cholesterol have dem - ixed from the lamellar phase lipid , which means that the actual cholesterol concentration in the bilayer must be lower than the nominal composition . The actual bilayer composition is unknown , and changes continuously as the nonequilibrium cholesterol crys - tals slowly remix with the lamellar phase . Our attention has been focused on the true , max - imum solubility limit of cholesterol in hydrated phos - pholipid lamellae . Our observations are limited to the regime of high cholesterol content ( s 35 mol % ) . We have been concerned with the formation of artifactual crystals of pure cholesterol , which rep - resent an extreme of demixing . We have not exam - ined phospholipid / cholesterol mixtures of lower cho - lesterol content and we have not sought any evidence of demixing which does not produce pure cholesterol crystals . In our opinion , it remains an unanswered question , whether less extreme forms of artifactual demixing can occur in phospholipid / cholesterol mix - tures at lower cholesterol contents , or whether any such demixing would be reversible . For a discussion of the principles which may drive the demixing of components during conventional sample preparation , see Buboltz and Feigenson [ 15 ] . Cholesterol solubility limit experiments based on two novel preparative methods , RSE and LTT , seem to be free of demixing artifacts . These methods were designed to prevent demixing of lipids during sample preparation . Rapid solvent exchange does not pass the lipid mixture through an intermediary solid state , and so avoids any demixing that could be caused by complex solid - state phase behavior . In contrast , the strategy of low temperature trapping is to slow the kinetics of demixing . Mixtures are trapped in a well - mixed state by lyophilizing at low temperature . The following four points summarize our evidence that equilibrium results are obtained in experiments based on RSE or LTT . First , we could obtain reproducible M (cid:3) chol values by these prep - arative methods , but not by ¢lm deposition or lyo - philization ( Table 1 cf . Table 2 ) . Second , these two new methods are very dissimilar , employing com - pletely di¡erent strategies to prevent demixing , yet we obtain the same M (cid:3) chol values by either RSE or LTT ( Table 2 ) . Third , in every case , these solubility limits are higher than indicated by conventional preparations ( Table 1 cf . Table 2 ) , consistent with the elimination of a demixing artifact . Lastly , high cholesterol content bilayers prepared by RSE or LTT are stable . Even in samples which approach M (cid:3) chol , lamellar phase cholesterol remains in the bilayer and does not precipitate as crystals , even over pro - longed incubation up to 10 weeks ( Fig . 7 ) . Based on these four observations , we conclude that M (cid:3) chol values obtained by both RSE and LTT are the true , equili - brium values . It may well be that other methods of sample preparation , not examined in this work , can likewise yield reproducible , equilibrium values of M (cid:3) chol . It is notable that the true M (cid:3) chol values for PC or PE bilayers present a fairly simple picture . The head - group e¡ect is pronounced : exchanging a choline moiety for ethanolamine decreases the cholesterol solubility limit by about 15 mol % . In stark contrast , no acyl chain e¡ect could be observed in four di¡er - ent PC / cholesterol mixtures . A di22 : 1 - PC bilayer is nearly 40 % thicker than a di12 : 0 - PC bilayer [ 25 ] , yet the M (cid:3) chol values are essentially identical in these two membranes . Nor is M (cid:3) chol di¡erent in di16 : 0 - PC bi - layers . Thus , at room temperature , the interactions which determine M (cid:3) chol do not depend on whether the PC would form a gel or £uid bilayer in its pure state . Previously published cholesterol solubility limits have ranged between V 0 . 33 and V 0 . 66 for PC bi - layers [ 5 , 7 , 26 ] and between 0 . 35 and 0 . 40 for PE bilayers [ 11 ] . These studies have generally employed ¢lm deposition . In each of the studies which have reported a maximum incorporation of 66 mol % cho - lesterol , the samples have been sonicated [ 5 , 6 , 8 , 27 , 28 ] , whereas unsonicated preparations have generally produced lower apparent solubility limits of around 50 mol % cholesterol [ 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 ^ 10 , 29 ] . Some have concluded that the 66 mol % limit can only be achieved through sonication and is most likely a metastable state [ 6 ^ 8 ] . Our results clearly demonstrate that cholesterol may be stably incorpo - rated up to 66 mol % in multilamellar PC bilayers BBAMEM 77560 1 - 2 - 99 J . Huang et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1417 ( 1999 ) 89 ^ 100 98 without sonication . Cholesterol does not precipitate from these cholesterol - rich multilamellar bilayers , even over 10 weeks of incubation at room temper - ature ( Fig . 7a ) . The di¡erence in apparent M (cid:3) chol val - ues between unsonicated and sonicated ( convention - al ) preparations may imply that sonication can remix demixed cholesterol with the lamellar phase , possibly by disrupting or destabilizing cholesterol crystals . However , we have not studied this issue and can only speculate . It should be stressed that true , equilibrium values of M (cid:3) chol carry a clear and important thermodynamic meaning : at M (cid:3) chol , the chemical potential of choles - terol in the bilayer is equal to that of the monohy - drate crystal , W bilayerchol = W crystalchol . This is because the chemical potential of cholesterol in crystals of pure cholesterol monohydrate is a constant , W crystalchol . On the other hand , the chemical potential of cholesterol in a lipid bilayer , W bilayerchol ( M chol ) , is a function of its bilayer concentration . When M chol v M (cid:3) chol , cholesterol - satu - rated lamellar phase coexists with cholesterol mono - hydrate . Therefore , M (cid:3) chol is the cholesterol mole frac - tion at which the chemical potential of lamellar phase cholesterol becomes equal to that of the mono - hydrate crystal , i . e . , W bilayerchol = W (cid:3) chol . Such true , equilibrium values of M (cid:3) chol serve to com - pare the thermodynamics of mixing between choles - terol and other lipids in bilayers of di¡erent compo - sition . In a Monte Carlo simulation study [ 30 ] , we present a simple , microscopic interaction model of cholesterol ^ phospholipid mixing , containing a cho - lesterol multibody interaction term , which shows that the M (cid:3) chol values are most likely to occur near the discrete values of cholesterol concentration , 0 . 50 , 0 . 57 , and 0 . 67 , corresponding to phospholipid to cholesterol ratios of 1 / 1 , 3 / 4 and 1 / 2 , respectively . At these solubility limits , where the chemical poten - tial of cholesterol jumps steeply , cholesterol mole - cules form highly symmetrical regular distributions in bilayers . The physical origin of the multibody in - teraction might be related to the exposure of non - polar cholesterol to water at high cholesterol concen - tration , i . e . , the hydrophobic e¡ect [ 30 ] .
