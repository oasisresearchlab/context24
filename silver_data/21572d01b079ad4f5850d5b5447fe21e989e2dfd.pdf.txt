Membrane bending by actin polymerization Anders E Carlsson Actin polymerization provides driving force to aid several types of processes that involve pulling the plasma membrane into the cell , including phagocytosis , cellular entry of large viruses , and endocytosis . In endocytosis , actin polymerization is especially important under conditions of high membrane tension or high turgor pressure . Recent modeling efforts have shown how actin polymerization can give rise to a distribution of forces around the endocytic site , and explored how these forces affect the shape dynamics ; experiments have revealed the structure of the endocytic machinery in increasing detail , and demonstrated key feedback interactions between actin assembly and membrane curvature . Here we provide a perspective on these ﬁndings and suggest avenues for future research . Address Department of Physics , Washington University , One Brookings Drive , Campus Box 1105 , St .

Introduction Bending of internal and external membranes is essential for many cellular processes , including the formation of protrusions that explore the environment or drive cell migration , cytokinesis , internalization of molecules and organisms from outside the cell , and membrane trafﬁck - ing . Forces that bend the membrane include those from curvature - generating proteins ( CGPs ) that form a layer on the membrane , asymmetries between membrane leaﬂets , osmotic pressure , myosin activity , and actin polymeriza - tion . Actin - based forces are crucial for protrusion and cytokinesis , and they have been studied in detail via both experiments and modeling analysis [ 1 , 2 ] . Actin polymeri - zation is also important for generating pulling forces to drive several types of engulfment processes , usually work - ing in concert with CGPs . Actin is usually required when the force barrier is large , the engulfed object is large , or key proteins are missing . Endocytosis in mammalian cells requires actin under conditions that include tight substrate attachment [ 3 ] and increased membrane tension [ 4 , 5 ] . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis in yeast requires actin [ 6 ] . In phagocytosis , actin polymerization creates protru - sions around the target [ 7 ] , and is required for bead internalization [ 8 ] . Cellular entry of large virus particles , either spherical or elongated , requires actin polymeriza - tion [ 9 – 11 ] . Entry of apicomplexan parasites also requires actin in the host cell [ 12 ] . Finally , actin polymerization is important in vesicle trafﬁcking [ 13 , 14 ] . Here I review recent work treating the biophysical mecha - nisms by which actin polymerization aids endocytosis . To give an up - to - date account , I focus on papers published in the last two years ; Refs . [ 15 , 16 ] give more comprehensive reviews . There has been progress in understanding : ﬁrstly , the general mechanisms of pulling force generation by inhomogeneous actin polymerization ; secondly , how a spatial distribution of actin polymerization , in conjunction with CGPs , controls the shape of an invagination over time ; thirdly , how feedback between force and chemistry mod - ulates protein dynamics ; and ﬁnally , the types of additional mechanisms that assist actin polymerization in overcoming large force barriers or reduce these barriers . General mechanism of pulling force generation by actin polymerization A concise relationship between the spatial distribution of actin polymerization and the membrane forces gives useful perspective on the bending mechanisms . A focus of polymerization generates a center of pushing force surrounded by pulling forces , while a local polymerization ‘hole’ generates a center of pulling force surrounded by pushing forces ( see Figure 1 ) . Actin polymerization sur - rounding the hole drives retrograde ﬂow , which pulls the actin in the hole region backwards into the cell , creating the pulling force . Ref . [ 17 ] developed a quantitative relationship between polymerization and force , treating the actin network as an elastic medium with stiffness ( Young’s modulus ) E , bounded at the x (cid:1) y plane by a rigid membrane . Inhomogeneous actin polymerization was described by g ( x , y ) , the total extent of z - direction growth . For growth varying in the x - direction with wave - length L , g ( x , y ) = g 0 [ 1 + cos ( 2 p x / L ) ] , the actin force den - sity f a ( x , y ) was f a ð x ; y Þ ¼ 2 p g 0 E 3 L cos 2 p x L (cid:1) (cid:3) : ð 1 Þ For uniform polymerization ( L ! 1 ) , f a = 0 because the actin network treadmills into the cell ; unless it is attached Available online at www . sciencedirect . com ScienceDirect www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2018 , 50 : 1 – 7 to an internal organelle or to a substrate , this requires only enough force to overcome the viscous drag force , which is much smaller than membrane - bending forces . Thus forces are generated by differences in actin polymeri - zation from point to point . Since f a ( x , y ) is proportional to E , effective force generation requires a stiff actin net - work . Strong membrane attachments are also required in regions of pulling force . Dynamic control of membrane by actin polymerization forces Refs . [ 18 (cid:3) , 19 , 20 , 21 (cid:3) ] have examined how actin and CGPs jointly determine the membrane shape , using assumed spatial distributions of the actin - polymerization force . Equilibrium membrane conﬁgurations for z - direction actin forces were calculated by minimizing a continuum model of the free energy W : W ¼ Z S ½ 2 k ð C (cid:1) C 0 Þ 2 þ s (cid:4) dS þ P 0 V (cid:1) Z S f a zdS ð 2 Þ Here S is membrane area , k is the bending stiffness , C is the local curvature , C 0 is the preferred curvature imposed by CGPs , s is the membrane tension , P 0 is the turgor pressure , f a is the assumed actin force density , z is the displacement of the membrane , and V is the volume of the invagination . The ﬁrst three terms describe energy penalties for curvature different from the preferred value , pulling membrane area into the invagination , and creating volume against the osmotic pressure , while the last term describes the energy from actin polymerization . Addi - tional terms were used to describe actin forces in other directions and other contributions to the curvature energy . Several types of actin force distributions were treated . Refs . [ 20 , 21 (cid:3) ] treated pulling forces spread out over on a disk of radius 30 – 50 nm , balanced by an outer ring - shaped distribution of pushing force from actin polymerization ( see Figure 2a ) , as was proposed in Ref . [ 22 ] . Ref . [ 18 (cid:3) ] treated a central point pulling force ( Figure 2b ) . Ref . [ 19 ] treated a ring - shaped distribution of pulling forces . Refs . [ 19 , 20 , 21 (cid:3) ] also treated lateral forces ( Figure 2c ) , as sug - gested by Ref . [ 23 ] . For low or vanishing turgor pressure , the actin force made the difference between arrested invagination and com - plete budding [ 19 , 20 , 21 (cid:3) ] . The details differ from model to model . Ref . [ 20 ] found a ‘snap - through instability’ as a function of actin force at a membrane tension of 0 . 08 mN / m , in which a tube shape suddenly transforms to a vesicle attached by a long tether . The pushing force required to invaginate the membrane was 190 pN in an ‘actin - only’ model , and about 30 % less when CGPs were included . Since a polymerizing actin ﬁlament can probably generate a force of a few pN , these forces correspond to 50 – 100 growing ﬁlaments . On the other hand , Ref . [ 21 (cid:3) ] found that at a lower membrane tension of 0 . 02 mN / m , with coat proteins having the same stiffness as the membrane , actin 2 Cell architecture Figure 1 Slower local polymerization causes invagination Faster local polymerization drives protrusion Uniform polymerization produces no force Fo r ce D e n s i t y A c t i n P o l y m e r i z a t i on Actin network Cell membrane Current Opinion in Cell Biology Membrane bending by inhomogeneous actin polymerization .

Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2018 , 50 : 1 – 7 www . sciencedirect . com polymerization eliminates a snap - through instability as a function of coat - protein area ( Figure 3a ) . A similar effect occurred in calculations with a higher coat - protein stiffness , at a higher membrane tension of 0 . 2 mN / m . The actin forces required to overcome the lower mem - brane tension were less than 15 pN . Ref . [ 19 ] pre - dicted that a ‘pearling instability’ could assist vesicle pinch - off . Ref . [ 18 (cid:3) ] used a higher turgor pressure value of 1 MPa to treat endocytosis in yeast , using the balance of forces shown in Figure 3b . The turgor pressure dominated the force opposing invagination , and an actin force of about 3000 pN was required to form a vesicle . This force is larger than can be generated by the 100 – 150 growing ﬁlaments [ 24 (cid:3) ] at the endocytic site . The actin force led to neck constriction in the presence of spontaneous curva - ture from CGPs . Anisotropic CGPs were also found to stabilize the invagination . The disk / ring force distribution ( Figure 2a ) assumed in Refs . [ 20 , 21 (cid:3) ] is supported by a recent estimate of the actin force from measured membrane - deformation pro - ﬁles [ 17 ] . A force balance on the membrane was set up including contributions from membrane bending , mem - brane tension , turgor pressure , cell wall , and actin poly - merization . The ﬁrst four contributions were obtained from the measured proﬁles and a calculation of the cell - wall force . This allowed the actin - polymerization force density to be obtained . The pulling force distribution was spread out over a central disk of radius about 40 nm . It was balanced by a larger region of pushing forces , . The spatial distribution of actin polymerization required to generate this force proﬁle was obtained using an elastic - gel model of a growing actin network [ 17 ] . A ring - shaped distribution of actin growth , surrounding a disk of ‘passive’ actin attached to the membrane , pro - duced the required force distribution . This mechanism places stringent requirements on the actin gel , requiring a Young’s modulus (cid:5) 80 kPa , and growth forces > 10 pN per ﬁlament . The general mechanism assumed in several of these models , is supported by recent correlative light and electron - microscopy experiments , in which the mem - brane - binding regions of Sla2 ( yeast homolog of Hip1R ) , which links actin to the membrane , or the entire cross - linking protein Sac6 ( yeast ﬁmbrin ) , were deleted [ 25a ] . In Sla2 - mutated cells , actin patches formed at the mem - brane , but no bending was observed , consistent with Sla2 acting to transmit pulling forces from the actin network to the membrane . Deletion of the crosslinker Sac6 pre - vented or reduced membrane bending , consistent with the requirement of a stiff actin gel for successful endocy - tosis . A ring - shaped region of actin polymerization is also consistent with recent experiments [ 25b ] showing that a ring of the actin nucleation promoting factor ( NPF ) Las17 surrounds a Sla2 disk . Mechanochemical feedback loops and their effect on protein dynamics A stochastic 3D model of the actin network [ 24 (cid:3) ] treated protein dynamics and membrane deformation simulta - neously , building on previous work [ 26 ] . The network was grown explicitly in three dimensions from a preex - isting ring of the actin NPF Las17 and taken to be inﬁnitely rigid . A negative - feedback interaction was assumed , in which ﬁlament branching events can detach and inactivate a Las17 molecule from the membrane with ﬁnite probability . Pulling forces were assumed to turn on at a certain critical number of ﬁlaments and subunits . As in Ref . [ 18 (cid:3) ] it was found that actin polymerization was too weak to overcome commonly accepted turgor pres - sure forces . A smaller value was used , on the assumption that other factors provide the remaining force , or reduce the force requirements . This model reproduced the pulse behavior of NPFs and F - actin during CME in yeast , and explained the effects of several other mutations ( see Figure 3c ) [ 24 (cid:3) ] . It also predicted an increase in Las17 Actin membrane bending Carlsson 3 Figure 2 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Current Opinion in Cell Biology Assumed distributions of forces used to calculate effect of actin polymerization on vesicle budding .

( c ) Lateral forces . www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2018 , 50 : 1 – 7 count upon reduction of Las17 branching activity , which was conﬁrmed by measurements of the Las17 count . Recent work placing cells on curvature - inducing nano - pillars has clariﬁed mechanochemical interactions in endocytosis [ 27 (cid:3) ] . Proteins preferentially recruited to curved membrane regions included actin , the actin NPF cortactin , and the curvature - generating proteins clathrin and epsin . Because actin polymerization gener - ates membrane curvature , these ﬁndings imply that actin and membrane curvature constitute a positive - feedback loop . There are also negative - feedback loops connecting actin polymerization with membrane bending . For exam - ple , the curvature - generating protein FBP17 assists actin polymerization , but actin polymerization creates mem - brane tension that inhibits FBP17 assembly [ 28 ] . Factors that could increase actin polymerization forces or reduce the required force barrier in yeast The above calculations suggest that it is difﬁcult for polymerizing actin ﬁlaments to to overcome generally accepted turgor pressure values of 0 . 5 MPa or more in yeast . The following factors could either increase the force available , or reduce the force requirements . Lateral polymerization . The actin force estimates assume a branched network of actin ﬁlaments , as suggested by Ref . [ 29 ] , at ﬁxed orientations . However , the orientation of the ﬁlament tips during endocytosis is not known . The amount of force that can be generated by a ﬁlament increases if it is oriented nearly parallel to the membrane [ 30 ] . Ref . [ 31 ] showed that ﬁlaments polymerizing lat - erally into a wedge - shaped space between the membrane and the rest of the actin network could generate very large forces . This model is consistent with the ﬁnding [ 32 (cid:3) ] that newly polymerized actin is incorporated near the mem - brane , but does not explain why Arp2 / 3 complex assem - bles farther from the membrane than actin [ 32 (cid:3) ] . On the other hand , forces from the membrane onto ﬁlament tips will also bend them toward the plane of the membrane , increasing their force - generating potential . Motor activity . Inward motion of the membrane during endocytosis in yeast requires Type - I myosin motor activ - ity [ 33 ] , which could enhance the actin force in at least two ways . First , myosins could move along actin scaffolds while bound to the membrane , thus pulling the mem - brane out if the scaffold is oriented appropriately [ 34 – 36 ] . Recent work has measured forces associated with mem - brane - bound Type - I myosins [ 37 ] . Forces of about 1 pN could be generated parallel to a lipid bilayer ( Figure 4a ) ; they were limited by myosin diffusion in the bilayer . Such frictional forces can enhance vesicle scission [ 36 ] . Larger forces might be obtained in cells because membrane proteins could increase the myosin friction . Lateral forces can be converted to pulling forces by a ‘zippering effect’ 4 Cell architecture Figure 3 f = 15 pN 0 - 100 - 200 - 3 0 0 - 2 0 0 - 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 0 0 R ( nm ) Z ( n m ) σ σ f a Newly polymerized actin Actin Membrane Sla2 ∏ ( a ) ( c ) ( b ) Current Opinion in Cell Biology Simulation results .

Second , myosins simultaneously attached to the membrane and an actin ﬁlament barbed end , if appropriately oriented , could push the growing ﬁlament far enough away from the membrane to allow barbed end polymerization even against a large opposing force . Channel localization . Turgor pressure in yeast is regu - lated by channel proteins that control osmolyte outﬂow . Therefore a channel cluster might reduce the turgor pressure locally . The yeast glycerol channel Fps1 accu - mulates in patches [ 38 ] . In addition , the Kv3 . 3 channel ( in CHO cells ) is associated with actin polymerization [ 39 ] , and a similar association of channels with endocytic actin patches might occur in yeast . The effects of channel clusters at endocytic sites was explored by calculations of the osmolyte concentration proﬁle around a membrane patch with increased permeability [ 40 ] . The turgor pres - sure was reduced by a fraction determined by the ratio pa / D , where p is the enhanced permeability , a is the radius of the leaky region , and D is the osmolyte diffusion coefﬁ - cient . A cluster of 60 channels locally reduced the turgor pressure by 50 % , greatly reducing the force requirements for endocytosis . Smaller turgor pressure than is generally assumed . Mea - sured turgor pressure values are highly uncertain . The turgor pressure is often measured by increasing the exter - nal osmolyte concentration and evaluating at what point the cell membrane experiences zero net osmotic force . Since osmoregulation will increase the internal osmolyte concentration , this method may overestimate the turgor pressure . A recent rapid indentation method [ 41 ] over - came this limitation . This led to a turgor pressure of 0 . 2 MPa for budding yeast , considerably smaller than most measured values . However , purely mechanical measurements of the turgor pressure in ﬁssion yeast [ 42a ] have yielded values of over 1 MPa , and it is not clear how osmoregulation would affect these measurements . Conclusion Work over the past two to three years has solidiﬁed a general picture of the effects of actin polymerization on membrane bending during endocytosis . Actin pulling forces , in addition to overcoming mechanical barriers , can have characteristic effects on the dynamic shape of a forming vesicle . The forces can be generated by a preexisting chemical pattern of actin NPFs and attach - ment proteins . Actin also participates in feedback loops controlling protein dynamics . However , numerous ques - tions remain unanswered . For example , it is not known how the chemical pattern is formed in the membrane , and how its size is established . Possible mechanisms include a two - dimensional chemical instability , perhaps involving SH3 - domain containing proteins [ 42b ] , and a mechani - cally limited growth process analogous to that limiting the size of actin bundles [ 43 ] . The orientation of the growing actin ﬁlament tips , which determines their force - gener - ating capability , is not known . The geometric arrange - ment of Type - I myosins and actin ﬁlaments that gener - ates pulling force has not been established . The biophysical mechanisms underlying the negative - feed - back interaction between actin and the NPFs remain to be pinned down . Finally , the extent to which channels affect the turgor pressure at the endocytic site is unknown . Acknowledgements This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health under Grant No .
