The term ‘‘meta - analysis’’ was created before the concept of systematic review . It was coined by Glass in 1976 1 to deﬁne a pool of statistical procedures to combine the results of several studies addressing the same research question . The Cochrane Collaboration deﬁnes ‘‘systematic review’’ as the synthesis of the results of several primary studies using techniques which decrease the risk of both bias and random error . 2 The unit of research is not the individual , but the research study . Currently , meta - analysis is restricted to the data analysis of a systematic review . In theory , a systematic review can be applied to any research question , either on etiology ( e . g . , the associa - tion between body mass index and clinical outcome for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome 3 ) , diag - nosis ( e . g . , the assessment of diagnostic accuracy of urinary TIMP - 2 · IGFBP7 for acute kidney injury in adults 4 ) , progno - sis ( e . g . , high - ﬂow nasal cannula oxygen therapy in adults with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure 5 ) or any inter - vention , either preventive ( e . g . , prone position ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress 6 ) or therapeutic ( e . g . , the use of ﬁbrinolytics in acute myocardial infarction - - - AMI - 7 ) . The general objectives of a systematic review can be : 1 . The assessment of consistency ( or its absence , that is , presence of heterogeneity ) across the primary studies ; for instance , the treatment with ﬁbrinolytics in AMI was highly heterogeneous across 33 studies , being due mainly to the delay in using the drug . 7 2 . To obtain an overall estimator of an association . In the meta - analysis of ﬁbrinolytics , the pooled odds ratio - - - OR - - - was 0 . 83 , highly signiﬁcant ( p < 0 . 001 ) . 7 3 . To identify the subgroups where an exposure ( a test , treatment , etc . ) shows a higher or lower strength of association . Fibrinolytics increase AMI mortality in the short term ( ﬁrst 48 h ) , although it is widely outweighed in the long term . 7 Meta - analysis failed in identifying any subgroup at an increased risk of death in the short term . 8 4 . The assessment of quality of the primary studies to offer a guide for future studies on the subject . Stages The outline of a systematic review is as follows 9 : 1 . A research question based on a hypothesis . 2 . Selection of the study population ( primary studies ) : ( a ) Sources of data . ( b ) Search criteria and inclusion criteria . 3 . Data collection : assessment of the validity of primary studies and extraction of relevant data . 4 . Meta - analysis : ( a ) Statistical methods to combine data . ( b ) Assessment of heterogeneity in the pooled esti - mates . ( c ) Ascertainment of publication bias . Origin of the hypothesis It is important to remember that a basic principle of research is that a hypothesis cannot be proved using the sample which suggested it . This is very common in systematic reviews , where investigators read some studies , note that they are not consistent ( no ﬁrm recommendation can be derived from them ) and decide to carry out a systematic review , in which the studies which gave the idea are also included in the meta - analysis . This procedure caused in the past rejection of meta - analysis as a method of research by prestigious scientists . 10 The ideal situation is that the hypothesis would be orig - inated in a sort different of research . For instance , in the association between garlic intake and risk of cancer the idea was suggested by experimental studies on rats fed with a diet enriched in garlic 11 : this launched a search of epidemi - ologic studies in humans to assess the relationship . Selection of the study population Search of studies General strategies The reference population in a systematic review are all the researches carried out on a subject in the world . There are several strategies : 1 . To search all the available information , either published or not . To get unpublished studies is not easy . As an approach , a researcher can consult theses , grants and projects funded by agencies ( governmental and private ) , presentations at scientiﬁc meetings , interviews to spe - cialists on the topic , etc . This strategy tries to minimize publication bias . 446 M . Delgado - Rodríguez , M . Sillero - Arenas 2 . To search published studies only : it is the most common . It saves time and money versus the previous strategy . However , it is prone to publication bias , if the published studies do not represent all the performed researches . 3 . To use the original databases of the identiﬁed primary studies . Its main advantages are a better adjustment of confounding bias and assessment of interaction ( if an exposure changes its effect according to other variables ) . Its drawback is that some authors do not like to share their data . Search methods The most usual search methods , which should be used com - bined , are the next : 1 . To search in web repertories of journals . There are many , some of them specialized on some topics ( can - cer , toxicology , etc . ) , territories ( SCIELO , Latin - American countries ) , health professions ( CINAHL on nursing ) , etc . The most popular is PubMed ( US National Library ) , but it is not enough . EMBASE should also be searched out . Today the ISI Web of Knowledge ( Institute of Scientiﬁc Informa - tion , USA ) includes several databases and repertories of meetings and doctoral theses . SCOPUS ( Elsevier ) , which includes PubMed , EMBASE , conference proceedings and books , is a very important resource . The last two sources are free for all Spanish universities . 2 . A handsearch of the references of all primary stud - ies , editorial , reviews , etc . , identiﬁed in the electronic search , is compulsory . 3 . To interview investigators on the topic . It can help in identifying unpublished studies and to update published results . 4 . Other sources : proceedings of scientiﬁc meetings , national repertories of doctoral theses ( such as the Span - ish TESEO database ) , grey information ( such as reports made by governmental agencies ) , etc . These sources are mainly used to identify the variables associated with pub - lication bias . Inclusion criteria They should be established before knowing the results of the primary studies and applied by two researchers indepen - dently to avoid selection bias . 12 - - - 15 Some criteria may require to be judged to get the full publication and not the abstract only : 1 . Language : It is very common in native English authors to restrict their search to studies published in English . We , in our ﬁrst published meta - analysis on oral contra - ceptives and cervix cancer , selected studies published in the languages of America and Western Europe ( English , Spanish , Portuguese , French , German , and Italian ) . 16 Currently , this is not an acceptable conduct as publi - cation bias can be caused by language . If a report is found in another language it should be translated by a professional in scientiﬁc writing ( it is misleading other approaches , such as translation programs or native lay persons who do not know scientiﬁc language ) , although it increases the costs . If one researcher wants to carry out a review on the studies performed in one geographi - cal area could restrict the language ; e . g . , if the research question is on chemoprevention and risk of neoplasm , a search will give many reports written in Chinese . There are two options : to include a Chinese investigator or to focus on the studies done in Western countries ( as an additional inclusion criterion ) , as it is very unlikely that an American , French , etc . , author publishes his results in Chinese , Korean , etc . 2 . Type of design : In pooling clinical trials it is usual to restrict selection to randomized trials , due to their higher validity ( very common in the Cochrane Col - laboration ) . In meta - analyses of observational studies , ecological studies are commonly discarded by the unpre - dictable effects of ecological fallacy . 3 . Characteristics of exposure and outcome : Correct deﬁ - nitions of the exposure ( even treatments are variable in timing , dose , etc . ) and outcomes ( single or combined ) are needed for proper analyses . 4 . Type of publication : It should be centered on original reports . Reviews , letters , abstracts and editorials should be discarded , as the methods cannot be assessed ade - quately . 5 . Quality : This item requires evaluation of the full report and will receive attention in the next epigraph . Data collection Information on aspects relevant to quality of the research should be obtained before gathering quantitative data to be pooled in meta - analysis . It has been said that meta - analysis cannot improve the quality of original studies . Therefore , researchers should be aware from the beginning whether the results of a report are menaced by bias . Data gathering should be done by two reviewers independently , 13 - - - 15 as it is very unlikely that a published report allows to get a deﬁnite answer on many methodological aspects . They should dis - cuss their results if they are inconsistent . A third investigator will resolve the doubts . Researchers can also contact corre - sponding authors of primary studies for details not addressed in the published report and / or for an update of the results . Assessment of study quality Most researchers apply a published scale to assess the quality of a report . Most systematic reviews are based on clinical trials . The ﬁrst scale to grade quality of controlled clinical trials was confectioned by Thomas Chalmers et al . in 1981 17 ( four pages , 37 items ) . From then many scales ( > 60 ) have been developed for trials . The most used is that of Jadad et al . , 18 because of its simplicity : just three questions on randomization , blinding and withdrawals , scoring up to 5 points . The Jadad scale has been a standard in Cochrane reviews , demanding a score of at less 3 to include a study . We have many reservations about using a cutoff point on a scale to select a study . For example , suppose a study with adequate randomization , analysis of drop - outs , but not blinded , being the assessment of outcome inﬂuenced by a researcher when he knows the exposure status . The score according to Jadad’s scale will be 3 , but is subjected to bias . 9 That means that a likely biased study could be Systematic review and meta - analysis 447 considered as adequate . There are important reports on the consequences of adopting cutoff points in scales to select studies . Jüni et al . 19 used 25 scales to grade trials in the comparison of two types of heparin ( low molecular weight heparin and normal ) , classifying the studies as of low or high quality according to each scale : when they pooled the studies of low and high quality of each scale , they reached contradictory results ; with some scales high quality stud - ies yielded better results for low molecular weight heparins than for normal ones , and the contrary with other scales . The former leads to the fact that a quality question - naire must include speciﬁc questions on the main biases which menace a research question . It is relatively easy to develop a quality scale on trials . On observational designs the situation is very different . Standardization is difﬁcult . Nevertheless , many efforts have been made . Presently , two general questionnaires are applied for these designs . The ﬁrst is the Newcastle - Otawa scale 20 and the second is the STROBE statement 21 ; it should be remembered that they are general questionnaires , and that for a proper evaluation of bias , speciﬁc questions on the main limitations to be avoided should be added . For example , when we did our meta - analysis on oral contraceptive use and cervix cancer , we included questions on the main biases on this relationship . 22 Should be blinding applied in the assessment of study quality ? It is not needed according to the manual of the Cochrane . We do not share this opinion as there are in epidemiology an unsurmountable number of reports on information bias : how people can inﬂuence their answers by previous knowledge . Researchers can be inﬂuenced by countries ( USA is equal to Slovenia ? ) , institutions ( Harvard or Jaen ? ) , prestige of authors , etc . If the reviewers of qual - ity are pristine ( e . g . , students of epidemiology ) there is no problem ( it has been used in Harvard ) , but if the reviewer is an experienced researcher he should be blind to avoid bias . To do this use a scanner , digitize the paper , discard all the ﬁliations and proceed to evaluation . Could a researcher in a ﬁeld do a systematic review ? Of course . However , he may have privileged information on some studies and both study selection and quality assessment may be biased . It would be advisable in these situations that neutral data collectors , according to a written protocol , carry out these tasks . The usefulness of a quality questionnaire is not to obtain an overall quality score , but to get data on methodological details of a study , procedures applied to decrease bias , and so on . These data can be used later to justify heterogeneity among studies . Meta - analysis We will describe the methods for combining published stud - ies . ( If databases are pooled in one ﬁle , statistical analyses are conventional with the recommendation of including a new variable - - - the name of study - - - in multivariable models . ) This can be accomplished by several programs , speciﬁc for meta - analysis ( such as the Review Manager of the Cochrane , or Comprehensive Meta - analysis ) , or included in general sta - tistical programs ( SAS , R or S - Plus , SPSS , and Stata ) . We prefer the latter ones as they allow to do conventional anal - yses in the same database . Table 1 Notation of a study with binary variables ( exposure and outcome ) . Outcome + Outcome − Total Exposure + a b n 1 Exposure − c d n 0 Total m 1 m 0 n i Note : this notation can serve for several designs : ( a ) cohort , being n 1 i and n 0 i the exposed and the non - exposed , respectively ; ( b ) controlled trial , being n 1 i and n 0 i the experimental and con - trol groups ; or ( c ) case - - - control , being m 1 i and m 0 i the groups of cases and controls .

Equation Relative risk ( RR ) a / n 1 c / n 0 Variance of natural logarithm RR 1 a + 1 c − 1 n 1 − 1 n 0 Odds ratio ( OR ) a × d b × c Variance of natural logarithm OR 1 a + 1 b + 1 c + 1 d Risk difference ( RD ) R 1 − R 0 = an 1 − cn 0 Variance of RD R 1 ( 1 − R 1 ) n 1 + R 0 ( 1 − R 0 ) n 0 The main idea to pool data from several studies is the concept of weighted mean . Any mathematical procedure applied to combine data needs two ﬁgures from each study : a parameter ,  i , and a weight , w i . Then , a weighted average or pooled estimate is computed :  p = ( (cid:2) w i  i ) / (cid:2) w i . Methods for binary variables Most published meta - analyses deal with binary variables and follow the notation shown in Table 1 . In this table several parameters can be calculated : relative risk ( RR ) , odds ratio ( OR ) and risk difference ( RD ) . The equations to estimate them are detailed in Table 2 , where also the formulae to calculate their variances are given . The parameter most often estimated in meta - analysis is the OR , which conveys the same meaning of RR . One important difference between RR - OR and RD is that the former do not follow a lineal scale , but exponential . This means that a variance for RR and OR can only be estimated if logarithms are taken . The inverse of variance method ( IOV ) 23 In this situation the weight is the IOV of the parameter . If OR or RR is chosen , that means that the parameter to be pooled is the logarithm ( OR ) or logarithm ( RR ) . After pooling , the antilogarithm ( or exponentiation ) will be applied . Some statistical programs do by default the transformation , but others do not . The IOV method can be used for both raw data and multivariate - adjusted parameters . In Table 3 we reproduce a published meta - analysis 24 on the comparison between application of non - invasive ven - tilation and standard oxygen therapy in adults with acute hypoxemic non - hypercapnic respiratory failure . The IOV can be applied in two ways : as a ﬁxed - effects model FEM or a random - effects model ( REM ) . The FEM is 448 M . Delgado - Rodríguez , M .

On the contrary , the REM departs from the fact that not all the studies could be located , so meta - analysis pools a sample of studies . That is why in the weight of this model two terms are considered : one is the intra - study variance and the other is the sampling error , or between - study vari - ance , which increases the overall variance of the REM . If there is not sampling error the REM simpliﬁes to the FEM . The pooled RR with REM for example of Table 3 is 0 . 60 ( 95 % CI = 0 . 45 - - - 0 . 79 ) , p = 0 . 001 ; whereas the results with the FEM are RR = 0 . 75 ( 95 % CI = 0 . 66 - - - 0 . 85 ) , p < 0 . 0001 . The relative weights for each study in the two models are displayed in Table 4 . One relevant conclusion derived from the weights is that the relative inﬂuence of each study on the pooled RR changes ; e . g . , the heaviest study with the FEM is that of Lemiale , which has 1 . 5 times more inﬂuence than the study by Frat . With the REM the differences between the weights decrease and the two studies show a similar weight . That is thought to be serious limitations of the REM which gives more importance to small studies , more prone to publication bias ( see in Table 4 that the small studies have more weight in the REM ) . Another criticism raised with the REM is that while a standard error has a biological meaning ( is the root square of the variance : mean of the quadratic differences of the series regarding the mean ) , the between - study variance has no biological interpretation . 25 The method can very easily be computed with the statistical package Stata . 26 The commands related to meta - analysis are not included in the program , although they can be discharged free from the Stata website . The command which does all the above analyses is metan . For binary varia - bles metan works with 2 , 3 , or 4 variables . With 2 variables the 1st one is the parameter ( if OR / RR is the logarithm of them ) and the 2nd is the standard error ; with 3 , the 1st one is the parameter , the 2nd the lower limit of the CI , and the 3rd the upper limit ; and with 4 variables , metan assumes to work with raw data in the order of Table 1 : a ( exposed cases ) , b ( exposed non - cases ) , c ( non - exposed cases ) , and d ( non - exposed non - cases ) . If the FEM is demanded ﬁxedi should be written in the options , and randomi for REM . When logarithms are introduced ( 2 - - - 3 variables ) , the option eform yields OR / RR in the output . The default of the output of metan includes a forest plot , in which the parameter of each study is inside a box whose area is proportional to the weight of the study . The forest plot of the example of Table 3 is displayed in Fig . 1 . Mantel - Haenszel’s ( MH ) method 27 It is a procedure for raw counts ( as in Table 1 ) . The weight is the product of exposed non - cases by non - exposed cases divided by the sample size . It is appropriate when there is no confounding ( mainly randomized trials ) . With the command metan MH is the default with a FEM . If a REM is wanted , the term random must be speciﬁed in the options . This method is more adequate than the IOV when data are sparse ( low counts ) . One important fact to remember is that when a 0 count is found in exposed or non - exposed cases , metan adds 0 . 5 to each cell ( a default ) .

Peto’s method 28 It is also a method for raw data and uses the Peto’s OR in which the expected exposed cases ( versus the observed exposed cases , cell a in Table 1 ) in the exposed group is estimated using the incidence of cases in the whole study ( exposed plus non - exposed ) . It is a FEM and a REM is not available . It is appropriate for trials with a bal - anced design in the experimental and control groups , and when OR is close to 1 ; under other circumstances the method can yield biased results . 29 One of its advan - tages over the previous methods is to deal with 0 cases in the control group , although there are better methods using the Mantel - Haenszel’s method 30 ; they are imple - mented in the command mar , by Doménech ( Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona ) in his course on Systematic Reviews ( http : / / www . metodo . uab . cat / indexDesktop . htm ) , 9 but not in metan . In meta - analysis several statistical methods can be applied on the same database . This is a form of sensitivity analysis . If all of them agree it is reassuring . In the example , IOV , MH and Peto give similar ﬁgures ( results not shown ) . However , if disagreement is observed the assumptions of each method should be revised and taken into account for a decision . In this review we have not enough space to detail sensitivity analyses based on the correction of potential biases ; about confounding , more useful for meta - analysis of observational studies , the method is described in Ref . 9 . Methods for continuous outcomes That is the case , for example , of serum cholesterol levels after a treatment versus levels in a control group . In this situation the only method to be used is the IOV with its two options , FEM and REM . Here the command metan can works with 2 , 3 , 4 , or 6 variables . With 2 variables the 1st is the mean difference and the 2nd its standard error ; with 3 the order is mean difference , and its CI lower and upper limits ; for 4 variables the order must be the mean of the exposed group , its standard error , and the same for the non - exposed group ; and for 6 variables , mean of the exposed group , its lower and upper limits of the CI , and the same for the non - exposed group . The methods to estimate the pooled estimate are beyond the scope of this manuscript but a thorough review can be found elsewhere . 31 Cumulative meta - analysis It is to carry out a meta - analysis adding in each step a new study which are ordered by a continuous variable . In this way , the inﬂuence of a study on the previous estimate is seen . The most common cumulative meta - analysis is by date of publication : studies are ordered by their year of publica - tion ( from the past ) and the program does a meta - analysis adding each time a more recent study . A paradigmatic exam - ple is the meta - analysis by Lau et al . 7 on ﬁbrinolytics and mortality in AMI : it shows how a deﬁnite conclusion could have been reached in the 1980s , before the two megatrials ( GISSI - I , ISIS - 2 ) had been done , saving millions of deaths . Other common variables used in cumulative meta - analysis are rate of the outcome in the control group ( it is usual to see how the magnitude of effect decreases as the rate in the control group is higher ) , delay in applying an intervention , quality of the study , etc . It is useful to iden - tify variables which could explain heterogeneity among the studies . In Stata the command for cumulative meta - analysis is metacum . One important thing to remember is that the ana - lyst has to order the studies in the database ( commands 450 M . Delgado - Rodríguez , M . Sillero - Arenas Antonelli ( 2000 ) Delclaux ( 2000 ) Hilbert ( 2001 ) Ferrer ( 2003 ) Squadrone ( 2005 ) Squadrone ( 2010 ) Zhan ( 2012 ) Brambilla ( 2014 ) Frat ( 2015 ) Lemiale ( 2015 ) Jaber ( 201 6 ) ID Study 0 . 42 ( 0 . 16 , 1 . 07 ) 0 . 72 ( 0 . 45 , 1 . 14 ) 0 . 66 ( 0 . 47 , 0 . 91 ) 0 . 61 ( 0 . 46 , 0 . 80 ) 0 . 59 ( 0 . 45 , 0 . 77 ) 0 . 56 ( 0 . 43 , 0 . 73 ) 0 . 55 ( 0 . 42 , 0 . 71 ) 0 . 50 ( 0 . 39 , 0 . 64 ) 0 . 70 ( 0 . 58 , 0 . 84 ) 0 . 75 ( 0 . 65 , 0 . 87 ) 0 . 75 ( 0 . 65 , 0 . 85 ) RR ( 95 % CI ) 1 . 1 . 5 1 1 . 5 Figure 2 Cumulative meta - analysis , ﬁxed - effects model , of the example shown in Table 3 . sort and gsort ) . The options of this command are similar to metan . A cumulative meta - analysis of the data in Table 3 is displayed in Fig . 2 . In this situation the image conveys the meaning that the ﬁrst published studies obtained stronger associations than the later ones . In meta - analysis it is very usual to read : ‘‘a FEM was carried out and if heterogeneity was signiﬁcant a REM was applied’’ . This is an example of data torturing , and it is not serious , as investigators can select the model which agrees more with their beliefs . Heterogeneity and publication bias have a role in the election of the model ; therefore , after commenting these aspects , it will be addressed . Heterogeneity With any program every calculated pooled estimate is accompanied with a heterogeneity test . The procedure implemented by all programs to detect heterogeneity is the (cid:3) 2 of Cochran , 32 later named as Q . 33 It is a statistic which lacks statistical power and it is recom - mended that the signiﬁcance level should be at least 0 . 1 , instead of the classic 0 . 05 . Today , the parameter I , 2 the percentage of unexplained heterogeneity , is required in meta - analysis . 34 , 35 Metan provides these statistics in all analyses . The presence of heterogeneity leads to think that the pooled parameter is obtained from studies which reach different conclusions . Suppose that you are said that the mean tall of Africans is 1 . 75 , and that in Africa there are two races only , Watusis ( mean tall 2 m ) and Pygmeans ( mean stature 1 . 5 m ) , 50 % each ; under these conditions , if one travels to Africa he will ﬁnd that the mean stature he was said has no sense as there are two means . This is what happens when heterogeneity is detected : some studies may lead to different effect esti - mates . Thus , it is essential to identify the reasons behind it . To select variables which could explain heterogeneity , any researcher should be aware that they can be divided in two groups : 1 . Related to design : ( a ) The design itself : cohort studies sometimes do not yield the same results of case - control studies ; e . g . , in a meta - analysis on cholecystectomy and risk of colon cancer the association was only supported by case - control studies . 36 ( b ) Characteristics of the design : for instance , conceal - ment of allocation in randomized trials does not support the results with open randomization lists . 37 Validated questionnaires on diet do not yield the same results of non - validated ones on the associ - ation between ﬁber and colon cancer . 38 There are many other examples . 2 . Related to the study population ( a ) Characteristics of the exposure : for example , in the meta - analysis of Lau et al . , 7 the delay in treatment justiﬁed the heterogeneity . ( b ) Type of outcome : in the previous cited meta - analysis on cholecystectomy and risk of colon cancer the asso - ciation was appreciated for proximal colon cancer and not for distal cancer . 36 ( c ) Modiﬁers of the relationship between exposure and outcome : e . g . , Fine et al . 39 found that the efﬁcacy of pneumococcal vaccine was higher in hospitalized patients than for the general population . To explain heterogeneity several strategies of analysis can be applied : 1 . Stratiﬁed analysis : For instance , Bernal et al . 40 found a strong heterogeneity in their study on the associa - tion between vasectomy and prostate cancer . They did a stratiﬁed analysis dividing the studies in two groups : one dealing with detection bias appropriately ( peo - ple undergoing vasectomy are thoroughly explored ) and the remaining . The association was seen in studies not addressing detection bias . This sort of analysis requires enough number of studies in each strata ; it cannot be applied in meta - analysis with a low number of studies . The command metan allows to do stratiﬁed analysis with the option by . 2 . Meta - regression : It is the name for linear multivari - able regression analysis applied to meta - analysis . The dependent variable is the parameter of each study ( log - arithms when OR / RR are of interest ) . It could be done by common commands of Stata weighting the studies by their variance , although there is speciﬁc command for meta - analysis , metareg . We recommend its use , as it allows to do Monte - Carlo simulations ( permute option ) , very relevant when the number of studies is less than 10 and / or several variables are included in the model . For instance , we did it in a meta - analysis on estro - gen replacement therapy and risk of breast cancer , in which a highly signiﬁcant heterogeneity was present . The inclusion of two variables ( proportion of women receiv - ing long - term treatment - - - > 5 years - - - and proportion of current users ) in the model yielded an r 2 of 0 . 8 , i . e . the two variables justiﬁed an 80 % of the variability . 41 3 . Cumulative meta - analysis : as already said this procedure allows to see candidate variables to be included in a formal meta - regression analysis . Systematic review and meta - analysis 451 0 . 2 . 4 . 6 . 8 1 S t anda r d e rr o r - 2 - 1 0 1 2 Ln RR Funnel plot with pseudo 95 % c onfidence limits Figure 3 Funnel plot of the example of Table 3 . 4 . Inﬂuence analysis : this procedure tries to detect the study / ies causing heterogeneity . The analysis is repeated excluding the candidate studies . To detect them it is use - ful the forest plot given by default by metan , in which an outlier can be identiﬁed . Publication bias It is produced when the published studies do not represent all the researches carried out . Several determinants of pub - lication bias have been identiﬁed : type of funding , 42 conﬂict of interest , 43 preconception , 44 institution prestige , 45 lan - guage of the journal , 46 etc . , but two variables are the most inﬂuential : statistical signiﬁcance of the main result and sample size . 42 , 47 , 48 On these variables most of the common procedures to detect publication bias are based upon . The simplest procedure to assess publication bias is the funnel plot . In the past the graphic could be horizontal and vertical , using the standard error or sample size . Today all funnel plots are vertical : in x - axis the parameter of each study and in the y - axis the standard error of the parameter . To discard bias the image should be symmetrical around of a vertical axis drawn through the pooled effect estimate . The Stata command for this is metafunnel . The funnel plot of the example in Table 3 is shown in Fig . 3 . It is easy to see that there are studies with great ﬁgures of standard error on the left side , but not on the right , that is , the small studies suggest a stronger effect of non - invasive ventilation than the big ones . It is convenient to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of the presence of publication bias . Several procedures , based on regressions on different types of ﬁgures , are implemented in the command metabias of Stata : Begg , 49 Egger , 50 Harbord 51 and Peters . 52 According to simulation studies the best is that of Peters , although the most used is Egger . We have used metabias to assess the presence of publication bias ( or small - study effects as preferred for Egger ) in the example of Table 3 . The Egger test requires in the varlist of metabias the parameter ( remember the logarithm of OR / RR when they have been chosen ) and its standard error , whereas for Peters test the raw data ( cells a , b , c , d of Table 1 ) are needed . In the article of example 3 it is said that there is ‘‘no obvious publication bias’’ . The funnel plot is clearly asymmetrical ; furthermore , the signiﬁcant results for the tests of Egger Table 5 Questions to be considered in the election between a ﬁxed effects model ( FEM ) and a random effects model ( REM ) ( sources : 9 , 56 - - - 59 ) . Question 1 : the scope Can treatment ever achieve beneﬁt ? FEM Will the treatment produce beneﬁt ‘on average’ ? REM Question 2 : ‘universal sample’ Are you ‘sure’ that all the existing studies , either published or not , have been located ? Yes : FEM Not : REM Question 3 : differences in sample size Are there strong differences in sample size ( more than 5 : 1 ) in the studies ? Yes : Consider that the REM increases the inﬂuence of small studies , more prone to publication bias ; it may be better the FEM Not : REM Question 4 : number of the to be combined How many studies are to be pooled ? < 20 : REM if question 3 is answered negatively ≥ 20 : To take into account the previous questions before election Question 5 : sample size of most primary studies It is very high , e . g . , > 5000 participants ? Yes : Consider REM , as any minor difference in effect estimates would be highly signiﬁcant with FEM No : To take into account the previous questions before election Question 6 : heterogeneity Is there heterogeneity in pooled effect estimate ? Yes : If it is not explained by additional analyses ( see the text ) , the pooled estimate has no sense No : FEM Question 7 : publication bias Is there publication bias ? Yes : If it is possible , give stratiﬁed analyses by sample size ( either with the FEM or REM ) , assessing heterogeneity , and offer a tentative explanation for the differences No : See the other questions ( p = 0 . 002 ) and Peters ( p = 0 . 03 ) , not applied in the article , suggest the very opposite . Another procedure , the ‘‘trim and ﬁll’’ 53 , 54 requires a dif - ferent command , metatrim , also free in the Stata website . It is not very used , although , under asymmetry in a funnel plot , it allows to reconstruct a symmetrical image , assessing the consequences of bias . There are other procedures , some of them to assess the number of non - signiﬁcant studies needed to turn a signiﬁ - cant association into a non - signiﬁcant one ; if the number is high it is very unlikely that all of them could be unpublished , but if the number is low ( e . g . , 1 - - - 3 ) , the meta - analysis is 452 M . Delgado - Rodríguez , M . Sillero - Arenas Table 6 The AMSTAR scale for evaluating systematic reviews . 15 Item Question 1 Was an ‘‘a priori’’ design provided ? 2 Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction ? 3 Was a comprehensive literature search performed ? 4 Was the status of publication ( i . e . , grey literature ) used as an inclusion criterion ? 5 Was a list of studies ( included and excluded ) provided ? 6 Were the characteristics of the included studies provided ? 7 Was the scientiﬁc quality of the included studies assessed and documented ? 8 Was the scientiﬁc quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions ? 9 Were the methods used to combine the ﬁndings of studies appropriate ? 10 Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed ? 11 Were potential conﬂicts of interest included ? very sensitive to unpublished reports . 55 They are not imple - mented in Stata , although they can be run in the command mar , by Doménech . 9 Heterogeneity and publication bias are important regarding the election between a FEM and a REM in meta - analysis . In Table 5 we give an outline about how to proceed . 9 , 56 - - - 59 Finally , there are validated guidelines to evaluate a systematic review . 13 , 15 The protocol AMSTAR is detailed in Table 6 . 15 In the PRISMA statement the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta - analysis are detailed . 60 Remember that the quality of the infer - ence obtained by a meta - analysis is not better that the quality of the primary studies : if one meta - analyzes garbage the product will be meta - analyzed garbage , just garbage .
