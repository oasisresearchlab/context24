Stem cell therapies have shown promise in treating diabetic wounds with pre - clinical and clinical studies . However , little bibliometric analysis has been carried out on stem cells in the treatment of diabetic wounds . In this study , we retrieved relevant papers published from January 1 , 2003 , to December 31 , 2023 , from Chinese and English databases . CiteSpace software was used to analyze the authors , institutions , and keywords by standard bibliometric indicators . Our analy - sis findings indicated that publications on stem cells in the treatment of diabetic wounds kept increasing . The most prolific author was Qian Cai ( n = 7 ) and Mohammad Bayat ( n = 16 ) in Chinese and English databases , respectively . Institutions distribu - tion analysis showed that Chinese institutions conducted most publications , and the most prolific institution was the Chinese People’s Liberation Army General Hospital ( n = 9 ) and Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences ( n = 17 ) in Chinese and English databases , respectively . The highest centrality keyword in Chinese and English databases was “wound healing” ( 0 . 54 ) and “in vitro” ( 0 . 13 ) , respectively . There were 8 and 11 efficient and convincing keyword clusters produced by a log - likelihood ratio in the Chinese and English databases , respectively . The strongest burst keyword was “exosome” ( strength 3 . 57 ) and “endothelial progenitor cells” ( strength 7 . 87 ) in the Chi - neseandEnglishdatabases , respectively .

Furthermore , diabetes can lead to a variety of complications over time . One of the most common complications of diabetes is the development of chronic wounds , which are slow SkinResTechnol . 2024 ; 30 : e13665 . wileyonlinelibrary . com / journal / srt 1of11 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1111 / srt . 13665 2of11 MA ET AL . to heal and can lead to severe infections and amputations . Standard wound care typically involves cleaning the ulcer , removing dead tissue and debris , and applying a dressing . 4 , 5 However , even with meticulous wound care , ulcers in diabetic patients often fail to heal . Therefore , thereisaneedfornewtherapiesthatcanpromotehealingandprevent complications . In recent years , stem cells have been demonstrated to play a cru - cial role in tissue repair and regeneration , making them an attractive option in treating chronic wounds , including diabetic foot ulcers . 6 , 7 Stemcellsareatypeofcellthathasthepotentialtodifferentiateintoa varietyofothercelltypes , andtheclassificationsarebasedontheirori - gin and differentiation potential . For example , mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) areadultstemcellsthatcandifferentiateintovariouscelltypes involved in the healing process , such as endothelial cells , fibroblasts , and keratinocytes . 8 Adipose tissue - derived MSCs ( AMSCs ) were able to promote wound healing in diabetic mice . 9 Induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) are adult cells that have been reprogrammed to a pluripo - tent state , meaning they candifferentiate intoany celltype inthe body and can be used in regenerative medicine without the ethical concerns associated with embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) . 10 Previous studies also found the applications and prospects of iPSCs in animal wound healing models , including diabetic ulcers and limb ischemia . 11 Bibliometrics is one of the essential quantitative index evalua - tion methods , mainly based on the quantity and quality of academic publications , and makes objective evaluations via the characteristics of content and structure . 12 , 13 With the development of computer technology , large professional databases , and various software , for example , CiteSpace , helped to realizethe automation , intelligence , and visualization of bibliometrics and significantly improved the evalua - tion efficiency . CiteSpace software is run in a Java - based environment and was first created by Chen MeiChao , a professor from Drexel Uni - versity , United States . 13 , 14 The primary purpose of Citespace is to provide researchers with a graphical representation of the relation - shipsbetweendifferentscientificpapers , authors , andinstitutions . This can be extremely useful for reviewing key areas of research and iden - tifying current collaborators and research institutions . In this review , we use bibliometric analysis to summarize the advances in stem cell treatment of diabetic wounds . 2 METHODS 2 . 1 Data sources and search strategies The Chinese publications were obtained through the China National Knowledge Infrastructure ( CNKI ) database ( https : / / www . cnki . net / ) , Weipu database ( http : / / www . cqvip . com / ) , and WanFang database ( https : / / www . wanfangdata . com . cn / ) ; and the English publica - tions were obtained through the Web of Science Core Collection ( WoSCC ) database ( https : / / www . webofscience . com / ) , PubMed database ( https : / / pubmed . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / ) and Scopus database ( http : / / www . scopus . com ) . The search strategy was “ALL = ( stem cells ) AND ( ALL = ( wound ) OR ALL = ( ulcer ) ) AND ( ALL = ( diabetes ) OR ALL = ( diabetic ) ) ”forrelevantpublications , andthereferencetypewas “article or review . ” The published year span was from 2003 to 2023 . All data were acquired on January 1 , 2024 , to avoid the prejudice caused by the database update . The duplicated , unrelated , or editorial publications and case reports were removed . 2 . 2 Bibliometrics and visualization analysis The method was described in our previous study . 15 Downloaded the information of Chinese publication and English publications from the Chinese database and English database , respectively ; and saved them as Refwork format and plain text format , respectively . The presenta - tion of institutions have been modified to improve accuracy : ( a ) the different departments of the same institution were considered as one institution ; ( b ) the university and its affiliated hospitals were consid - ered as two institutions ; ( c ) the different names of the same institution ( such as the previous one and the current one ) were considered as one institution . Thedownloadedfileswerefirstrenamedasdownload _ * . txt , and then imported them into Citespace V6 . 2 . R2 for bibliometric anal - ysis . When mapping visualization knowledge figures , we followed the main process steps of CiteSpace , including time slicing , threshold - ing , modeling , pruning , merging , and mapping . The core concepts of CiteSpace include burst detection , betweenness centrality , and het - erogeneous networks , enabling timely visualization of research status , hotspots , and frontiers . Nodes in different maps represent authors , institutions , or keywords , respectively ; the larger node represents the more frequency . The connections between nodes represent close rela - tionship in studies ; the thicker line represents stronger relationship , the lighter line represents later relationship . The parameters were set as follows : ( 1 ) time slicing at one year per slice ; ( 2 ) the selection uses a modified g - index in each slice : k = 25 , which means that data were extracted on the top 25 results for each time slice ; ( 3 ) the node type was set as author , institution , source , and keyword , respectively ; ( 4 ) choosing “Pathfinder” and “Pruning the merged network” for Pruning parameters area to simplify the network andhighlightitsessentialstructuralfeaturesofkeywords , whilechoos - ing “Pruning the sliced network” for other information . The remaining parameters were the default settings . 3 RESULTS 3 . 1 Bibliometric analysis of the temporal distribution According to the search strategy , 370 , 101 , and 292 publications were retrieved from CNKI , Weipu , and Wanfang databases , respectively . Meanwhile , 876 , 1201 , and 696 publications were retrieved from WoSCC , Pubmed , and Scopus , respectively . After removing the dupli - cates , 146 and 636 publications on stem cell treatment of diabetic wounds were retrieved from Chinese and English databases between 2003 and 2023 . As shown in Figure 1 , the number of publications in MA ET AL . 3of11 FIGURE 1 The number of publications on stem cell in the treatment of diabetic wounds from 2003 to 2023 . the English database showed a generally growing trend over the last decade . While in the Chinese database , the number of publications exceeded 10 for the first time in 2010 , and the highest number was 27 in 2022 . 3 . 1 . 1 Bibliometric analysis of the author’s distribution The top five most prolific authors in both Chinese and English databases are shown in Table 1 . The most prolific ( n = 7 ) author in the Chinese database was Qian Cai from Lanzhou General Hospi - tal of Lanzhou Military Command , China . He mainly focuses on the effect of stem cells on wound repair in diabetic rats . The most prolific ( n = 16 ) author in the English database was Mohammad Bayat from ShahidBeheshtiUniversityofMedicalSciences , Iran . Hisprimaryfocus is combining photobiomodulation therapy and stem cells to improve wound healing in diabetic rats . Co - author analysis showed networks of authors who had co - authorship in Chinese ( Figure 2A ) and English databases ( Figure 2B ) ; the larger spot indicated more publications , the thicker line indicated more co - authorship , and the lighter line indi - catedlatercollaborativeyear . InChinesedatabases , therearesixmajor networks led by Qian Cai , Peisheng Jin , Xiaobing Fu , Dianbao Zhang , Tongbin Chu , and Meng Zhang , respectively . There are two major net - works in English databases , one from China led by Xiaobing Fu ; the other is an international group of researchers from the U . S . and Iran . 3 . 2 Bibliometric analysis of the institution’s distribution The top five most prolific institutions in both Chinese and English databases are shown in Table 2 . The Chinese People’s Liberation Army General Hospital was the most prolific ( n = 9 ) institution in the Chi - nese database and the third ( n = 13 ) in the English database . Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Iran , was the most prolific ( n = 17 ) institution in the English database . All institutions in the Chi - nese database were from China . In the English database , institutions from China had the most publications ( n = 218 ) , followed by the USA ( n = 190 ) and Iran ( n = 51 ) ( Table 3 ) . The degree score indicated the number of institutions that have collaborated with ; the institutions from Italy and England collaborated with more institutions ( n = 8 ) from other countries . The institutions from Germany had the highest centrality ( 0 . 78 ) , followedbyIran ( 0 . 67 ) andEngland ( 0 . 65 ) , whichindi - cated that research of these institutions had a higher impact in this field . Co - institution analysis showed networks of institutions that had collaborated in Chinese ( Figure 3A ) and English databases ( Figure 3B ) . In the Chinese database , most of these collaborations were limited to medicaluniversitiesandtheiraffiliatedhospitals . TheChinesePeople’s Liberation Army General Hospital had the highest degree ( n = 7 ) and centrality ( 0 . 01 ) . In English databases , most of these are international collaborations ; Harvard Medical School had the highest degree score ( n = 12 ) and centrality ( 0 . 15 ) . 3 . 3 Bibliometric analysis of co - occurring keywords The occurrence of high frequency and high centrality of keywords show the focus of most authors in a period , that is , the hot spots and frontiers of research . The top 10 keywords in both Chinese and English databases are shown in Table 4 . In Chinese databases , the highest frequency , highest degree , and highest centrality keywords were “diabetic foot” ( n = 43 ) , “stem cells” ( n = 17 ) , and “wound heal - ing” ( 0 . 54 ) , respectively .

The network of co - occurring keywords in Chinese and English databases is shown in Figure 4 . The clustered network analysis functions to summarize the co - occurring keywords by a scientific calculation method . The silhou - ette score above 0 . 7 is considered an efficient and convincing cluster . 16 There were 8 ( silhouette score = 0 . 9111 ) and 11 ( silhou - ette score = 0 . 8761 ) clusters produced by the log - likelihood ratio in Chinese and English databases , respectively ( Figure 5 ) . The clusters comprisedkeywordswithdifferentcolors ; the # 0clustercontainedthe largest number of keywords , and the overlap indicated the keyword belonged to more clusters simultaneously . Therefore , the diabetic foot was the primary concern in the Chinese database , while the collagen scaffold was the primary concern in the English database . The top 10 keywords with the strongest citation bursts are pre - sented in Figure 6 . The light blue line indicates the time interval , the blue line indicates the period when a keyword appeared , and the red line indicates the period when a keyword had a burst . These burst keywords were detected based on the increase in the frequency of the MA ET AL . 5of11 FIGURE 3 Bibliometric analysis of the institutions of publications from the Chinese ( A ) and English ( B ) databases .

The strongest ( strength 3 . 57 ) and latest ( from 2020 till now ) burst of keywords in the Chinese database was the “exosome . ” Exosomes can promote cell proliferation , reduce the inflammatory response , and promote new angiogenesis and wound healing ; therefore , they may play an essential synergistic role in stem cells treatment of diabetic wounds . In English databases , the strongest and latest burst of keywords were “endothelial progenitor cells” ( strength 7 . 87 ) and “diabetic wound” ( from 2019 till now ) , respectively . Endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) are a type of stem cell that can differentiate into endothelial cells , promote angiogenesis , and accelerate wound healing in diabetic patients . 4 DISCUSSION 4 . 1 Summary of findings Between 2003 and 2023 , 146 and 636 qualified Chinese and English publications were included in the final analysis , respectively . Overall , the number of publications in this field has risen annually . Researchers who had published more studies were more highly represented , sug - gestingtheirhighreputationinthefieldandthelikelihoodthattheywill generate in - depth discoveries regarding stem cells in the treatment of diabetic wounds . The most prolific authors were Qian Cai ( n = 7 ) and Mohammad Bayat ( n = 16 ) in Chinese and English databases , respec - tively . Institutions distribution analysis showed that most publications were conducted by Chinese institutions , and the most prolific institu - tionsweretheChinesePeople’sLiberationArmyGeneralHospital ( n = 9 ) and Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences ( n = 17 ) in Chi - neseandEnglishdatabases , respectively . Ascollaborationamongthese institutions was relatively limited , efforts to establish more robust relationships may help further advance this field . The highest central - ity keyword in Chinese and English databases was “wound healing” ( 0 . 54 ) and “in vitro” ( 0 . 13 ) , respectively . There were 8 and 11 effi - cient and convincing keyword clusters produced by a log - likelihood ratio in the Chinese and English databases , respectively . The strongest burst keywords were “exosome” ( strength 3 . 57 ) and “endothelial pro - genitor cells” ( strength 7 . 87 ) in the Chinese and English databases , respectively . 6of11 MA ET AL .

FIGURE 5 Bibliometric analysis of the keywords of publications from the Chinese ( A ) and English ( B ) databases . 4 . 2 Hot spots and frontiers 4 . 2 . 1 Mechanism studies In recent decades , the use of stem cells for the treatment of diabetic wounds has gained significant attention . Regarding the mechanisms of action , different types and sources of stem cells have been shown to work through different pathways . For example , MSCs can secrete vari - oussubstancessuchasgrowthfactorsandcytokines , participateinthe body’s regulation of immune response and promote angiogenesis ; in contrast , ESCs and iPSCs are pluripotent and self - renewing , have the potential to differentiate into various cell types in the body . MSCs can be found in various tissues , such as bone marrow , cord blood , and cord tissue , placental tissue , adipose tissue , etc . There - fore , MSCs can differentiate into osteoblasts , chondroblasts , and adipocytes under appropriate conditions . 8 MSCs are nutrient facto - ries that produce a wide variety of cytokines and growth factors , such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , transforming growth factor - β ( TGF - β ) , Angiopoietin - 1 ( Ang - 1 ) , and stroma - derived factors - 1 ( SDF - 1 ) . 17 , 18 Wu et al . found that in db / db mice treated with bone marrow MSCs ( BM - MSCs ) , VEGF , Ang - 1 , and keratinocyte - specific protein keratin were higher in wounds , and the growth of keratinocytes increased at the wound site . 19 Hou et al . found that the MSC - conditioned medium accelerated the migration and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells by regulating the chemokine receptors - relatedsignalingpathwayssuchasprotein - serine - threonine kinase ( AKT ) signaling pathway and extracellular signal - regulated kinases ( ERK ) signaling pathway in both in vivo and in vitro studies . 20 Furthermore , MSCs also have immunomodulatory functions , such as increasing the levels of anti - inflammatory factors IL - 10 and IL - 4 and decreasing the levels of TNF - α and IFN - γ . 21 In vitro studies have shown that MSCs can promote keratinocytes to participate in wound epidermis formation and regulate the local microenvironment . MSC - derived exosomes ( MSC - Exos ) , the major secretion products of the paracrine pathway of MSCs , are membranous vesicles released into the extracellular matrix after the fusion of intracellular vesicles with cell membranes . 22 Accumulated studies have shown that MSC - MA ET AL . 7of11 FIGURE 6 Top 10 keywords with the strongest citation bursts from the Chinese ( A ) and English ( B ) databases . Exos can not only show biotherapeutic efficacy similar to MSCs in the treatment of diabetic wounds but also have extra advantages . First , exosomes act as paracrine forms of stem cells to avoid immune rejec - tion , oncogenesis , and other side effects . It has been reported that exosomes can directly inhibit the activity of effector T cells , thus sup - pressing the immune response . 23 , 24 Second , exosomes can pass the blood - brainbarrierandplacentalbarrierandplayaroleinthemicroen - vironment thatstem cellscannotreach , whichindicatesthatexosomes have a more comprehensive application range than stem cell therapy alone , and can directly reach the target area through the barrier . 25 , 26 Third , the dose of MSC - Exos can be adjusted , which can easily be manually controlled during application . Exosomes can be personal - ized , adjusted dose and composition to deliver drugs to patients . 27 Fourth , MSC - Exos can enhance the therapeutic effect through gene modification , such as modifying cells through gene overexpression and using exosomes derived from the cells to provide potential drug delivery systems , or overexpressing some bioactive components in exosomes to promote wound healing . 28 Fifth , the regulation of MSC - Exos is more extensive , and can repair or prevent the damage caused by diabetic complications through multiple effects . 29 Human umbil - ical cord MSC - Exos can also improve type 2 diabetes by reversing peripheral insulin resistance and alleviating the destruction of islet cells . 30 IPSCs were first reported in 2006 , they can differentiate into all cell types in the three dermal layers , and terminally differentiated cells may promote diabetic wound healing through paracrine or direct cellular effects . 31 , 32 Kashpur et al . injected iPSC - derived fibroblasts into 3D tissues and found that they could grow into diabetic wounds and promote wound healing , indicating that iPSCs have the poten - tial to treat diabetic foot ulcers . 33 Recently , Gorecka et al . found that differentiation of neonatal fibroblast iPSCs into smooth muscle cells ( experimental group ) and delivery via collagen matrix can accelerate wound healing and wound bed neovascularization in mice with dia - betes . ComparedwithAMSCsinthecontrolgroup , smoothmusclecells in the experimental group remained on the wound bed 7 days after implantation and secreted higher levels of angiogenic cytokines to acceleratewoundclosure . Inaddition , thenumberofpro - inflammatory M1 macrophages decreased in the wound area of the experimen - tal group , while the number of pro - regenerative M2 macrophages increased . 34 Itohetal . showedthathumaniPSC - differentiatedsmooth muscle cells significantly improved in mice with lower limb ischemia . 35 These studies indicate that iPSCs are one of the ideal cell types for wound treatment . 4 . 2 . 2 Application studies Stem cell manipulation can help host cells homing to the wound site , mainly including increasing stem cell circulation , enhancing cell bind - ing to the wound site , promoting stem cell differentiation into target cells , andincreasingangiogenesis . 36 Promotingwoundneovasculariza - tion is by far the most important goal of wound healing because it is the limiting factor in promoting the wound healing process . Various advances in stem cell manipulation to achieve this goal are discussed below . A scaffold matrix can manipulate the stem cell microenvironment to enhance its ability to promote regeneration . Dash et al . found that scaffold collagen fiber density could improve cell regeneration by regulating the secretion function of iPSC - SMC . 37 Dense fibrous colla - gen increases the production of pro - healing cytokines , such as VEGF , IL - 8 , IL - 10 , TGF - β , and keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF ) , as well as endothelial cell proliferation and migration . Surface modification of scaffolds with bioactive polymers also affects the activity of stem cells . For example , adding laminin and hyaluronic acid increased cell sur - vival and promoted VEGF production in implanted cells . 38 In addition , intermolecular bonds in the scaffold microenvironment regulate cell proliferationanddifferentiationthroughphysicalactions . Forexample , MSC can differentiate into neurons , myoblasts , or osteoblasts when culturedinpolyacrylamidehydrogelsofvaryinghardness ( 0 . 1 – 25kPa ) ; The “softer” matrix ( 0 . 1 – 1 kPa ) was favorable for differentiation into neurogenic cells , while the “harder” matrix ( 8 – 17 kPa ) was favorable for differentiation into myogenic cells . 39 Recent studies in nanotech - nology also emphasize the importance of the physical properties of scaffolds , such as manipulating cell fate by regulating porosity 8of11 MA ET AL . to accelerate wound healing . 40 Therefore , changing the mechanical properties of the matrix helps the implanted stem cells to perceive mechanical , environmental factors , thus promoting cell migration and differentiation and accelerating wound healing at different stages . HypoxicpreconditioningcanenhancetheabilityofMSCtopromote angiogenesis and thus promote wound healing . Rosova et al . proposed that cells should be preconditioned with hypoxia before transplanta - tion to resist apoptotic stimulation when transplanted into an internal environment with severe hypoxia , such as ischemic tissue at chronic wounds or other injury sites . 41 Another advantage of hypoxic precon - ditioning of MSC is to maintain cell dryness and pluripotency , which is very beneficial in areas requiring tissue regeneration . Stem cells can be genetically modified to improve their regenera - tive and therapeutic potential . Using iPSCs creates opportunities for further genetic modification to correct congenital defects . Teo et al . proposedtouseZFN , TALEN , CRISPR , andothertechnologiestorepair diabetes - related mutant gene sequences in vitro and then transplant thembackintodiabeticpatients . 42 GeneticallycorrectiPSCsofelderly diabeticpatientsremove defective genesrelatedtodiabetesand aging and enhance the effect of autologous cell therapy . Song et al . found that the introduction of v - Myc into human AMSCs by lentivirus trans - fection could promote VEGF secretion and in vitro angiogenesis . 43 The preclinical study also confirmed that MSC could be safely geneti - cally modified by lentiviral vectors , produced high levels of VEGF , and promoted angiogenesis in an animal model of lower limb ischemia . 44 Nanotechnology can enhance the potential and differentiation of stem cells . Adipose stem cells implanted into photosensitive and biomimetic core - shell nanofiber scaffolds can differentiate into epi - dermal keratinocytes under light stimulation . 45 Nanoparticles can also be used to deliver genetic material to cells . Yang et al . developed a non - viral , biodegradable polymer nanoparticle that had VEGF gene to MSC and ESC - derived cells ; the treated stem cells significantly enhanced the generative ability of VEGF , cell viability , and ability to bind target tissues . In a mouse model of lower limb ischemia , it was further confirmed that the vascular density of MSC transmutation into the VEGF genome by biodegradable polymer nanoparticles was significantly higher than that of the control group , and muscle degen - eration and tissue fibrosis were reduced . 46 These results suggest that engineered stem cells based on biodegradable polymer nanoparti - cles effectively treat ischemic diseases and show potential for wound treatment . MSCsandiPSCsexertparacrineeffectsbysecretingsomenutrients to promote the therapeutic effect of transplanted cells , which con - sistsofsolublefactors ( e . g . , cytokines , chemokines , andgrowthfactors ) and insoluble extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) . More and more research has focused on using secretions in cellular supernatants , especially soluble factors isolated from insoluble EVs . EVs contain nucleic acids , pro - teins , andlipidsderivedfromcells , andfunctionasimportantmediators of intracellular interactions . 47 The production of EVs was affected by the microenvironment , cell density , cell age , culture system geometry , hypoxia , and mechanical stress . 48 Many studies have shown that EVs fromdifferentcellsourcescanpromoteskinwoundhealingbypromot - ingcollagensynthesisandangiogenesis . 49 – 51 Inaddition , EVshavealso been loaded onto tissue engineering scaffolds as bioactive molecules for wound healing . 52 A recent meta - analysis showed that EVs rich in non - coding RNA or microRNAs significantly affected diabetic wound healing and positive improvements in vascular density and number , scar width , and reepithelialization . 53 These results help promote the clinical transformation of MSC - EV . Furthermore , the EVs can modify therapeutic materialstoproduceapredictabledose - response effectin vivo and remain active after a long time of storage . 4 . 2 . 3 Clinical studies Previous studies showed that stem cell transplantation is even bet - ter than surgery in improving wound healing and reducing amputation ratesinpatientswithdiabeticfootulcers . 54 Inthetreatmentofdiabetic wounds , the main stem cell transplantation methods include systemic injection and local injection . Systemic intravenous infusion of stem cells helps relieve some systemic complications of diabetes but may lead to embolization of MSCs in the lung , while arterial injection may improve the survival rate of circulating MSCs , but increases the risk of invasiveness and complications . 55 , 56 Although direct local injection is relatively simple , this method is not so efficient . 19 Scaffolds contain - ingbiomaterialscanimprovetheefficiencyofstemcelltransplantation , meanwhile , promote wound healing directly . 57 On the other hand , depending on the source of stem cells , trans - plantation can be divided into autologous and allogeneic in clinical practice . Autologous stem cells include peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMNCs ) , bone marrow mononuclear cells ( BMMNCs ) , BM - MSCs , AMSCs , andanadiposetissue - derivedstromalvascularfraction ( SVF ) . Allogeneic stem cells are isolated from allogeneic sources such as the placenta , umbilical cord , and amniotic membrane . 58 Compared with animal studies , the clinical studies also showed that both autol - ogous and allogeneic stem cells can promote angiogenesis , immune regulation , matrix remodeling , and the production of regenerative cytokines without observing adverse effects . 59 , 60 Overall , stem cells may be effective and safe for treating diabetic wounds in clinical stud - ies . However , due to the small sample size in each study , the clinical diagnosis and treatment standard of stem cells in the treatment of dia - betic wounds has not been established yet , which is also one of the limiting factors restricting its clinical application . To solve this prob - lem , it is necessary to conduct in - depth basic research and clinical trials on the application in this field and establish a set of clinical stan - dards through perfect experimental design and strict and meticulous observation . 61 4 . 3 Strengths and limitations This scientometrics study is the first to our knowledge to have exploredresearchtrendsfocusedonstemcellsinthetreatmentofdia - betic wounds from both Chinese and English databases , which helps researchers quickly understand the research hot spots and future trends in this field . Since Chinese researchers conducted most studies , MA ET AL . 9of11 the literature in the Chinese and English databases covered a sub - stantial amount of data in this field , which ensured the results were highly reliable . However , this study also had some limitations . First , due to the limitation of the language and format that the bibliomet - rics software can recognize , the relevant publications might not be exhaustively identified . Second , there was a time limit for our litera - ture search . Stem cell therapy was first introduced to wound healing in the late 20th century , and the number of relevant publications was small . 31 , 62 Third , recently published studies may have been largely overlooked concerning their significance owing to the low citation frequency inevitably observed during the immediate period following publication . 5 CONCLUSION In the present study , we utilized scientometrics to analyze research on stem cells in the treatment of diabetic wounds in both Chinese and Englishdatabases . Ourresultsrevealedthisfield’shigh - impactauthors , institutions , journals , keywords , andhotspots . Followingtheincreasing incidences of DM and the health strategies in response to the grow - ing burden of DM , publications on DF have increased remarkably since 2016 . China leads the research on stem cells in the treatment of dia - betic wounds . The recent studies focus on the mechanism , application , and clinical studies . The hotspots of this field include MSCs , exosomes , and biomaterials . Our results indicated a method for future therapies and research on stem cells in the treatment of diabetic wounds .
