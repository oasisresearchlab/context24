RESEARCH ARTICLE Acsl , the Drosophila ortholog of intellectual - disability - related ACSL4 , inhibits synaptic growth by altered lipids Yan Huang 1 , Sheng Huang 1 , 2 , * , Sin Man Lam 1 , Zhihua Liu 1 , ‡ , Guanghou Shui 1 and Yong Q . Zhang 1 , § ABSTRACT Nervous system development and function are tightly regulated by metabolic processes , including the metabolism of lipids such as fatty acids . Mutations in long - chain acyl - CoA synthetase 4 ( ACSL4 ) are associated with non - syndromic intellectual disabilities . We previously reported that Acsl , the Drosophila ortholog of mammalian ACSL3 and ACSL4 , inhibits neuromuscular synapse growth by suppressing bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) signaling . Here , we report that Acsl regulates the composition of fatty acids and membrane lipids , which in turn affects neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) synapse development . Acsl mutant brains had a decreased abundance of C16 : 1 fatty acyls ; restoration of Acsl expression abrogated NMJ overgrowth and the increase in BMP signaling . A lipidomic analysis revealed that Acsl suppressed the levels of three lipid raft components in the brain , includingmannosylglucosylceramide ( MacCer ) , phosphoethanolamine ceramideandergosterol . TheMacCerlevelwaselevatedin Acsl mutant NMJs and , along with sterol , promoted NMJ overgrowth , but was not associated with the increase in BMP signaling in the mutants . These findings suggest that Acsl inhibits NMJ growth bystimulating C16 : 1fatty acyl production and concomitantly suppressing raft - associated lipid levels . KEY WORDS : Neuromuscular junction , ACSL , Long - chain acyl - CoA synthetase , Fatty acid , Lipid , Synaptic growth INTRODUCTION Lipids are essential membrane components that have crucial roles in neural development and function ( Davletov and Montecucco , 2010 ; Lauwers et al . , 2016 ) . Dysregulation of lipid metabolism underlies a wide range of human neurological diseases including neurodegeneration and intellectual disability ( Bazinet and Laye , 2014 ; Najmabadi et al . , 2011 ; Sivachenko et al . , 2016 ) . Acyl - CoA synthetase long - chain family member 4 ( ACSL4 ) is the first gene in fatty acid metabolism associated with non - syndromic intellectual disability ( Longo et al . , 2003 ; Meloni et al . , 2002 ) . ACSL4 protein has two variants : a ubiquitously expressed short form ( Kang et al . , 1997 ) , and a brain - specific long form that is highly expressed in the hippocampus , a crucial region for memory ( Meloni et al . , 2002 ) . Indeed , ACSL4 has been shown to play an important role in synaptic spine formation ( Meloni et al . , 2009 ) . However , it is unclear how mutations in ACSL4 lead to intellectual disability . There are 26 genes encoding acyl - CoA synthetases ( ACSs ) in humans . Each of the enzymes has distinct substrate preferences for fatty acid with various lengths of aliphatic carbon chains . In contrast , there are 13 ACS genes in the Drosophila genome ( Watkins et al . , 2007 ) . ACSs convert free fatty acids into acyl - CoAs for lipid synthesis , fatty acid degradation or membrane lipid remodeling ( Masheket al . , 2007 ) . Forexample , ACSL4 converts long - chain fatty acids ( LCFAs ; aliphatic tails longer than 12 carbons ) , preferentially arachidonic acid ( C20 : 4 ) , into LCFA - CoAsthat are incorporated into glycerol - phospholipids ( GPLs ) and neutral lipids in non - neuronal cells ( Golej et al . , 2011 ; Kuch et al . , 2014 ) . The mechanism of how fatty acids and fatty - acid - modifying enzymes affect lipid composition , and thereby modulate development processes , is beginning to be understood in lower model organisms ( Kniazeva et al . , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2011 ; Zhu et al . , 2013 ) . Synaptic growth is required for normal brain function such as learning and memory . Many neurological disorders including intellectual disability are associated with synaptic defects ( Zoghbi and Bear , 2012 ) . The Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) is a powerful system for studying the mechanisms that regulate synaptic growth ( Collins and DiAntonio , 2007 ; Deshpande and Rodal , 2016 ) . Drosophila Acsl , also known as dAcsl , is the ortholog of mammalian ACSL3 and ACSL4 ( Zhang et al . , 2009 ) . We have previously reported that Acsl affects axonal transport of synaptic vesicles and inhibits NMJ growth by inhibiting bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) signaling ( Liu et al . , 2011 , 2014 ) . However , how Acsl affects lipid metabolism and the role of Acsl - regulated lipid metabolism in synapse development are largely unknown . In the present study , we demonstrate that Acsl positively regulates the abundance of the LCFA palmitoleic acid ( C16 : 1 ) in the brain . Reduced levels of C16 : 1 in Acsl mutants led to NMJ overgrowth and enhanced BMP signaling . A lipidomic analysis revealed that mannosyl glucosylceramide ( MacCer ) , phosphoethanolamine ceramide ( CerPE , the Drosophila analog of sphingomyelin ) and ergosterol levels were increased in Acsl mutant brains . Genetic and pharmacological analyses further showed that the increased level of MacCer and sterol underlie the NMJ overgrowth in Acsl mutants in a pathway parallel to BMP signaling . These results indicate that Acsl regulates fatty acid and sphingolipid levels to modulate growth signals and NMJ growth , providing insight into the pathogenesis of ACSL4 - related intellectual disability . RESULTS Acsl enzymatic activity is required for NMJ development Three different mutations in ACSL4 have been identified in patients with non - syndromic intellectual disability that are linked to reduced enzymatic activity ( Longo et al . , 2003 ; Meloni et al . , 2002 ) , suggesting that the enzymatic function of ACSL4 is required for normal brain function .

Weak hypomorphic Acsl 8 / Acsl 05847 mutants display synaptic overgrowth with excess satellite boutons , whereas the strong hypomorphic Acsl 05847 / Acsl KO combination results in more severe NMJ overgrowth phenotype in anterior abdominal segments ( Fig . 1A – C , J – L ; Liu et al . , 2014 ) . We assessed whether the ACSL enzymatic activity is required for normal NMJ growth by treating wild - type larvae with the general ACSL inhibitor triacsin C and the ACSL4 - specific inhibitor rosiglitazone ( Kim et al . , 2001 ; Van Horn et al . , 2005 ) . These larvae showed more total boutons and satellite boutons upon treatment than that in control larvae ( Fig . 1G – I , J ) . Accordingly , neuronal overexpression of wild - type but not disease - causing mutant ACSL4 , rescued the NMJ overgrowth in Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 mutants ( Fig . 1D – J ) . These results demonstrate that Acsl enzymatic activity is required for inhibiting synapse growth at NMJ terminals . Acsl localizes at ER and peroxisomes in neurons and a subset of non - neuronal cells , respectively ACSs might provide acyl - CoAs for mitochondrial β - oxidation , peroxisomal oxidation or lipid synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , depending on which organelle that a specific ACS associates with ( Fig . 2H ; Coleman et al . , 2000 ; Ellis et al . , 2010 ; Mashek et al . , 2007 ) . Many studies have reported that both rat ACSL4 and Drosophila Acsl are enriched in the ER ( Lewin et al . , 2002 ; Meloni et al . , 2009 ; O ’ Sullivan et al . , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2009 ) , suggesting that they have a role in lipid synthesis . Indeed , both ACSL4 and Acsl positively regulate lipid biosynthesis ( Golej et al . , 2011 ; Kuch et al . , 2014 ; Zhang et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , ACSL4 is also enriched in peroxisomes of rat liver ( Lewin et al . , 2002 ) . To clarify the metabolic function of Acsl in the brain , we examined Acsl localization in various organelles of motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord ( VNC ) . The expression of Acsl – Myc driven by motor - neuronal OK6 - Gal4 overlapped completely with proteins tagged with the ER retention signal KDEL , but only partly overlapped with the mitochondrial marker mito - GFP , the peroxisomal marker GFP – SKL and the Golgi marker anti - GM130 ( Fig . 2A – D ″ ) . The ER location of Acsl suggests that Acsl primarily activates fatty acids for lipid synthesis in the nervous system . Notably , Acsl – Myc driven by ubiquitous act - Gal4 was highly expressed in peripheral nerves and a few Elav - negative non - neuronal cells in the VNC ( Fig . 1E , G ) , and weakly expressed in a subset of Elav - positive neurons ( Fig . 1E , F ) .

Given that LCFAs are β - oxidized predominantly in mitochondria , whereas β - oxidation of very - long - chain fatty acids ( VLCFAs ; with 20 and more carbon chains ) occurs exclusively in peroxisomes ( Wanders and Waterham , 2006 ) , it is possible that Acsl might channel VLCFAs into peroxisomal degradation in a few non - neuronal cells . Acsl regulates brain fatty acid composition Mammalian ACSL4 has a substrate preference for arachidonic acid ( C20 : 4 ) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( C20 : 5 ) ( Golej et al . , 2011 ; Kang et al . , 1997 ) . C20 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids are absent in Drosophila ( Shen et al . , 2010 ) . To further understand how Acsl affects the fatty acid metabolism , we analyzed fatty acids in third - instar larval brains of Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 mutants . The brain lobes of these mutants were smaller than those of wild type , and ubiquitous or neuronal overexpression of human ACSL4 fully restored the brain size ( data not shown ) . We examined fatty acid composition from brain lipid extracts by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry ( GC - MS ) ( Christie , 1989 ) . Most fatty acids are trans - esterified from neutral lipids and membrane glycerol - phospholipids ( GPLs ) but not sphingolipids , whereas a small fraction is esterified from free fatty acids due to their low levels in Drosophila ( Christie , 1989 ; Hammad et al . , 2011 ) . We analyzed the relative proportion of abundant LCFAs including palmitic acid ( C16 : 0 ) , palmitoleic acid ( C16 : 1 ) , stearic acid ( C18 : 0 ) , oleic acid ( C18 : 1 ) and linoleic acid ( C18 : 2 ) . Lauric acid ( C12 : 0 ) and myristic acid ( C14 : 0 ) were not examined in this study due to their low endogenous levels . The relative abundance of C16 : 1 and C18 : 2 was reduced , whereas that of C16 : 0 was increased in Acsl - mutant brains ( Fig . 3A , B ) . Overexpression of human ACSL4 by tub - Gal4 in Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 mutants restored C16 : 1 but not C18 : 2 levels ( Fig . 3C ) , suggesting that both Acsl and ACSL4 positively regulate C16 : 1 abundance in larval brains . Fatty - acid - CoAs are incorporated into lipids in the ER by various acyltransferases ( Coleman et al . , 2000 ) . We next investigated the levels of C16 : 1 - containing GPLs by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry ( HPLC - MS ) . The relative level of phosphatidylethanolamine ( PtdEth ) and phosphatidylcholine ( PtdChl ) species with C32 : 1 or C32 : 2 chains , which primarily contain fatty acyl C16 : 1 , were markedly decreased in Acsl mutant brains ( Fig . 3D ) , suggesting that Acsl positively regulates C16 : 1 level in brain GPLs . These alterations were rescued by ubiquitous expression of Acsl by tub - Gal4 but not neuronal elav - Gal4 ( Fig . 3D ) , suggesting that full restoration of C16 : 1 level in brain GPLs requires ubiquitous Acsl , consistent with the fact that endogenous Acsl is expressed in diverse systems ( Zhang et al . , 2009 ) . It is probable that Acsl acts in non - neuronal tissues to facilitate the incorporation of exogenous C16 : 1 into brain lipids . Reduced C16 : 1 in Acsl mutants contributes to synaptic overgrowth We speculated that if the reduction in C16 : 1 fatty acyls contributed to NMJ overgrowth in Acsl mutants , then supplementation of C16 : 1 should suppress the NMJ overgrowth . Because fatty - acid - CoAs are Fig . 2 . Acsl localizes at the ER in neurons but at peroxisomes in a subset of non - neuronal cells .

Free fatty acids are substrates of Acsl , thus supplementation of C16 : 1 might rescue the NMJ defects in weak hypomorphic mutants with residual Acsl activity ( Fig . 3L ) . Feeding larvae with 1 . 5 % C16 : 1 or C16 : 0 did not affect NMJ growth in either wild - type or strong hypomorphic Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 mutants ( Fig . 3F , J ; data not shown ) , in which the Acsl protein is undetectable in larval brains ( Liu et al . , 2014 ) . In contrast , feeding larvae of weak hypomorphic Acsl 8 / Acsl 05847 mutants with C16 : 1 but not C16 : 0 completely suppressed the NMJ overgrowth ( Fig . 3G – J ) , suggesting that a reduction in C16 : 1 level might contribute to synaptic overgrowth in Acsl mutants . We previously found that synaptic overgrowth in Acsl mutants is due in part to elevated BMP signaling , as evidenced by an increased level of phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic ( pMad ) , an effector of BMP signaling at the NMJ ( Liu et al . , 2014 ) . Here , we found that supplementation of C16 : 1 but not C16 : 0 abolished the increase in pMad level in Acsl 8 / Acsl 05847 mutants ( Fig . 3G ′ – I ′ , K ) , supporting the idea that the reduction in C16 : 1 level contributes to the increased BMP signaling in Acsl mutants . To confirm that the correct level of C16 : 1 is required for normal NMJ growth , we examined larvae with mutations that affect C16 : 1 production . The Drosophila stearoyl - CoA desaturase Desat1 catalyzes the desaturation of LCFA - CoAs to produce monounsaturated fatty - acid - CoAs . desat1 11 mutants ( a null mutation ) exhibit decreased levels of C16 : 1 and C18 : 1 and a correspondingly higher level of C16 : 0 and C18 : 0 in membrane GPLs ( Kohler et al . , 2009 ) . We found that hypomorphic desat1 11 / desat1 EY07679 and desat1 119 / desat1 EY07679 mutants survived to the third - instar larval stage and showed significant NMJ overgrowth . Expression of Desat1 from a transgenic genomic clone restored NMJ growth in the mutants to control levels ( Fig . 4A – F ; Fig . S1 ) , indicating that Desat1 inhibits motor neuron bouton formation . Given that both Desat1 and Acsl positively regulate C16 : 1 level ( Fig . 4G ) , we speculated that the two enzymes inhibit NMJ growth through a common genetic pathway . RNA interference of desat1 driven by tub - Gal4 resulted in mild NMJ overgrowth . Importantly , NMJ overgrowthupon desat1 knockdown wassignificantlyenhanced by a heterozygous mutation of Acsl 05847 / + ( Fig . 4H – K , P , Q ) . Moreover , Desat1 overexpression driven by act - Gal4 had no effect on bouton number compared with the act - Gal4 control , but significantly suppressed NMJ overgrowth and abolished the increase in pMad level in Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 mutants ( Fig . 4L – T ; Fig . S1 ) . These results demonstrate that Desat1 and Acsl act synergistically to regulate NMJ development , probably by maintaining the balance of fatty acids , especially C16 : 1 . Raft - related lipid levels are elevated in Acsl brains In addition to affect fatty acid composition , Acsl might modulate the composition of lipid classes by selective activation of different fatty acids in ER .

We analyzed 10 major membrane lipid classes , including four classes of GPLs , PtdEth , PtdChl , phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ) and phosphatidylserine ( PtdSer ) ; four classes of sphingolipids , ceramide ( Cer ) , ceramide phosphatidylethanolamine ( CerPE ) , glucosylceramide ( GlcCer ) and mannosyl glucosylceramide ( MacCer ) ; and two sterols , cholesterol and ergosterol . Results for each lipid class were normalized to the sum of tested lipids and are represented as the molar percentage ( mol % ) of total membrane lipid ( Fig . 5A ; Table S1 ) . Heat maps depicting ratios of lipid levels between the indicated genotypes were generated to assess changes in lipid abundance ( Fig . 5B , D , E ) . The level of PtdEth , the most abundant membrane lipid , was decreased in both Acsl 8 / Acsl 05847 and Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 larval brains . In contrast , the level of two sphingolipids , CerPE and MacCer , was significantly increased in Acsl mutants ( Fig . 5A ) . The MacCer level showed the greatest change in Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 mutants relative to the wild type ( 2 . 8 - fold increase ; Fig . 5B ; Table S1 ) . The level of ergosterol , the major sterol in Drosophila , was also increased in Acsl mutants ( Fig . 5A ) . Sphingolipids and sterols assemble into detergent - resistant membrane microdomains known as ‘ lipid rafts ’ ( Lingwood and Simons , 2010 ; Rietveld et al . , 1999 ) ; hence , the Fig . 4 .

The alteration in membrane lipid composition in Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 brains was rescued by ubiquitous or neuronal expression of Acsl under the control of tub - Gal4 and elav - Gal4 , respectively ( Fig . 5A ) , indicating that abnormal lipid composition is specifically caused by loss of Acsl . Given that fatty acid moieties in sphingolipids cannot be trans - esterified ( Christie , 1989 ) , they were not previously analyzed by the aforementioned GC - MS ( Fig . 3A – C ) . We therefore examined the fatty acid profile for MacCer and CerPE by HPLC - MS . Fatty acids in sphingolipids were longer and more saturated than those in GPLs ( Fig . 5D , E ) , consistent with previous reports ( Carvalho et al . , 2012 ; Rietveld et al . , 1999 ) . The levels of individual MacCer and CerPE species containing a 14 - carbon - sphingoid base ( abbreviated as d14 ) and a VLCFA acyl chain were markedly elevated ( Fig . 5D , E ) , with a concomitant increase in whole classes of MacCer and CerPE in Acsl mutants . Notably , MacCer containing a d14 : 1 base and a C24 fatty acid acyl chain ( d14 : 1 / C24 : 0 ; Fig . 5C ) showed the most significant increase in Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 mutants ( 17 . 68 fold ; Fig . 5D ; Table S1 ) . Taken together , Acsl positively regulates PtdEth level but negatively regulates the level of sphingolipids CerPE and MacCer , especially the VLCFA - containing sphingolipids , directly or indirectly . Increased levels of MacCer and sterol promote synaptic overgrowth in Acsl mutants A lipidomic analysis showed that the increase in MacCer level was the greatest in Acsl mutants in all lipid classes we examined ( Fig . 5A , B ) . Furthermore , the extent of increase in MacCer parallels the severity of NMJ overgrowth in different allelic combinations of Fig . 5 . Levels of raft - related lipids are increased in Acsl mutant brains .

In addition , a previous study has reported that raft - related lipids are required for normal synapse density and size in cultured hippocampal neurons ( Hering et al . , 2003 ) . We therefore investigated whether the elevation in MacCer caused NMJ overgrowth in Acsl mutants . Consistent with the lipidomic profiling ( Fig . 5A , B ) , MacCer level showed an obvious increase in Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 motor neuron NMJs ( Fig . 6L , L ′ , P ) ; this increase was abolished by ubiquitous or neuronal but not muscle expression of Acsl by Mhc - Gal4 ( Fig . 6M , M ′ , P ) . Neuronal expression of human ACSL4 by elav - Gal4 also abrogated the upregulation of MacCer in Acsl - mutant NMJs ( Fig . 6P ) . We next determined whether reducing the level of MacCer could suppress the NMJ overgrowth in Acsl mutants . MacCer is generated by the mannosyltransferase Egghead ( Egh ) and converted into the acetylglucosyl MacCer by the N - acetylglucosaminyl transferase Brainiac ( Brn ) ( Fig . 6R ; Wandall et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . We found that reducing MacCer level by egh 62d18 mutation or neuronal overexpression of brn by nSyb - Gal4 resulted in fewer and larger boutons at NMJs ( Fig . 6D , I , J , Q ) . Moreover , a heterozygous egh 62d18 / + mutation significantly suppressed MacCer elevation and NMJ overgrowth in Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 mutants , whereas a homozygous egh 62d18 mutation or brn overexpression driven by nSyb - Gal4 fully restricted the MacCer level and NMJ overgrowth in Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 mutants ( Fig . 6C – F , I , J , N – Q ) . For example , the bouton number and size in egh 62d18 ; Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 double mutants were similar to those of egh 62d18 single mutants ( Fig . 6I , J ) , indicating that synaptic overgrowth in Acsl mutants depends on the elevated MacCer level . A lipidomic analysis revealed that the ergosterol level was significantly increased whereas that of cholesterol was decreased in Acsl mutants ( Fig . 5A ) ; the sum of ergosterol and cholesterol was nonetheless higher ( 1 . 16 - fold in Acsl 8 / Acsl 05847 and 1 . 21 - fold in Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 ) than in wild type . Like MacCer , sterol is also a constituent of lipid rafts and plays a crucial role in synapse development ( Hering et al . , 2003 ; Mauch et al . , 2001 ; Rietveld et al . , 1999 ) ; thus , we determined whether sterol depletion could suppress the NMJ overgrowth in Acsl mutants .

Feeding control larvae ( Acsl KO / + ) with 20 mM M β CD resulted in fewer and larger boutons at NMJs , whereas NMJ overgrowth was fully suppressed in Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 mutants by M β CD treatment ( Fig . 6G – J ) . Thus , an excess of sterol might contribute to the NMJ overgrowth in Acsl mutants . These results together suggest that increased levels of raft - related MacCer and ergosterol underlie the NMJ overgrowth in Acsl mutants . Acsl regulates C16 : 1 and MacCer to inhibit synaptic growth in parallel genetic pathways The above results demonstrate that Acsl regulates the levels of C16 : 1 and MacCer to inhibit synaptic growth . We next investigated whether there is a mechanistic link between reduced C16 : 1 and increased MacCer in Acsl mutant brains . C16 : 1 acyl chains were very limited and below the detection limit in sphingolipid species ( Fig . 5D , E ) , suggesting that the reduction in C16 : 1 in Acsl mutants might not directly affect sphingolipid level . In addition , the synaptic staining of MacCer was largely normal in desat1 119 / desat1 EY07679 mutants with impaired activity in producing C16 : 1 - CoA ( Fig . 7L – N ) . Finally , unlike in egh 62d18 ; Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 double mutants , egh 62d18 ; desat1 119 / desat1 EY07679 double mutants showed more numerous and smaller synaptic boutons than egh mutants ( Fig . 7G – J ; Fig . S1 ) , suggesting that the NMJ overgrowth in desat1 mutants likely did not depend on the MacCer level . Although we could not exclude the possibility that the decrease in C16 : 1 might indirectly influence MacCer level , these results suggest that the increase in MacCer level in Acsl mutants might not result from a reduction in C16 : 1 . The above results suggest that the reduction of C16 : 1 in Acsl mutants is associated with an increase in NMJ growth - promoting BMP signaling ( Fig . 3G – K ) . To determine whether MacCer level also affects BMP signaling , we first analyzed the pMad level . Contrary to expectation based on reduced bouton number , pMad level was unchanged in Brn - overexpressing larvae whereas it was significantly increased in egh 62d18 mutants ( Fig . 7K ) . Furthermore , egh 62d18 mutation or brn overexpression did not efficiently suppress the pMad increase in Acsl KO / Acsl 05847 mutants Fig . 7 .

These results together show that restriction of NMJ overgrowth in Acsl mutants by reducing MacCer does not act through BMP signaling . BMP signaling is negatively regulated by Daughters against decapentaplegic ( Dad ) and Rab11 , a small GTPase involved in endosomal recycling . Loss - of - function mutations in dad or rab11 result in elevated BMP signaling and synaptic overgrowth ( Liu et al . , 2014 ; O ’ Connor - Giles et al . , 2008 ) . To clarify the relationship between MacCer and BMP signaling , we examined the effects of egh 62d18 mutation on NMJ growth in dad j1E4 and rab11 93Bi mutants . If the NMJ overgrowth in dad j1E4 and rab11 93Bi mutants depends on normal levels of MacCer , then egh 62d18 mutation would be expected to suppress NMJ overgrowth in these mutants to the level of egh 62d18 single mutants . However , total and satellite bouton numbers in both egh 62d18 ; dad j1E4 and egh 62d18 ; rab11 93Bi double mutants were significantly more than those observed in egh single mutants ( Fig . 7A – F , I , J ) . These data suggest that MacCer acts , at least in part , in a pathway parallel to BMP signaling to promote NMJ growth . Taken together , our findings reveal that Acsl orchestrates a genetic pathway that inhibits NMJ growth by enhancing C16 : 1 abundance but restricting MacCer level ( Fig . 7O ) . DISCUSSION A reduced level of C16 : 1 fatty acid contributes to NMJ overgrowth in Acsl mutants Like ACSL4 , Acsl primarily associates with the ER and facilitates fatty acid incorporation into lipids ( Golej et al . , 2011 ; Kuch et al . , 2014 ; Meloni et al . , 2009 ; Zhang et al . , 2009 ) ; impairment of Acsl activity reduces the abundance of its substrate LCFAs in lipids . Although we did not directly determine the substrate preference of Acsl , our fatty acid analysis suggests that both Acsl and ACSL4 positively regulate C16 : 1 abundance in Drosophila brain ( Fig . 3 ) . The two proteins also have conserved functions in other processes , such as lipid storage ( Zhang et al . , 2009 ) , axonal transport and synaptic development ( Liu et al . , 2014 , 2011 ) . The similar NMJ overgrowth in desat1 and Acsl mutants suggests that the normal fatty acid composition is essential for proper development of synapses . The rescue effect of C16 : 1 , together with the genetic interaction between Acsl and desat1 ( Figs 3 and 4 ) , indicates that reduced C16 : 1 contributes to NMJ overgrowth in Acsl mutants . We previously reported that the synaptic overgrowth in Acsl mutants is due in part to an elevation of BMP signaling resulting from defects in endocytic recycling and BMP receptor inactivation ( Liu et al . , 2014 ) . Endosomes are membrane compartments that are regulated by various membrane lipids ( van Meer et al . , 2008 ) , particularly the conversion between different PtdIns species , such as PI ( 3 ) P , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and so on ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Lauwers et al . , 2016 ; Kelley et al . , 2015 ) . Here , our findings suggest that increased BMP signaling in Acsl mutants is associated with an imbalance in fatty acid composition , specifically , a decrease in C16 : 1 . It is thus possible that proper fatty acid composition is necessary for the normal conversion and localization of endosomal lipids ( e . g . PtdIns species ) , affecting endosomal recycling and BMP receptor inactivation . Future studies will examine the regulation of specific fatty acids such as C16 : 1 in endosomal recycling and BMP signaling . Acsl regulates lipid class composition Acsl primarily associates with the ER in multiple cell types including motor neurons and participates in lipid synthesis ( Fig . 2A ; O ’ Sullivan et al . , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2009 ) . In Drosophila , most of acyl chains in GPLs are C16 and C18 LCFAs without VLCFAs ( Hammad et al . , 2011 ; Rietveld et al . , 1999 ) . In contrast , sphingolipids contain higher levels of VLCFAs than LCFAs as acyl chains ( Lingwood and Simons , 2010 ; Rietveld et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , most LCFA - CoAs are channeled into GPLs whereas VLCFA - CoAs are mainly incorporated into sphingolipids in Drosophila . We found , here , that Acsl positively regulates the production of C16 : 1 - containing GPLs , as well as the level of PtdEth , the most abundant GPL in the brain ( Figs 3 and 5 ) . Presumably , fatty acids that are less preferred by Acsl could be channeled into lipids by other ACSs , and might show increased abundance because of a compensatory mechanism in Acsl mutants , which could contribute to the elevation in VLCFA - containing sphingolipids ( Fig . 5D – E ) . In addition to ER localization , ACSL4 and Acsl also localize to peroxisomes in a few non - neuronal cells ( Lewin et al . , 2002 ; Fig . 1Q – Q ″ ) , suggesting a role for these proteins in the activation of VLCFAs for peroxisomal degradation . Indeed , in animal models and patients with impaired peroxisomal function , accumulation of VLCFAs or increased levels of lipid species with longer fatty acid chains is observed ( Chen et al . , 2010 ; Faust et al . , 2014 ; Wanders and Waterham , 2006 ) . Thus , a defect in peroxisomal VLCFA degradation might underlie the elevation in sphingolipid species with VLCFA chains in Acsl mutant brains ( Fig . 5 ) . Alternatively , Acsl might affect lipid composition through a pathway that is independent of fatty acid incorporation . For example , as degradation of sphingolipids occurs primarily within lysosomes ( Xu et al . , 2010 ) , a defect in lysosomal degradation might lead to an accumulation of sphingolipids and sterols in Acsl mutants . In addition , fatty acids and acyl - CoAs are ligands of many transcription factors ( Ellis et al . , 2010 ; Schroeder et al . , 2008 ) , and ACSL3 activates the transcription of lipogenic genes in rat hepatocytes ( Bu et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , Acsl might transcriptionally regulate genes encoding enzymes involved in the metabolism of lipids such as MacCer , CerPE and PtdEth . However , the detailed mechanism of how Acsl affects lipid class composition , especially the downregulation of raft - related MacCer and CerPE by Acsl in the nervous system , remains to be elucidated . Raft - related lipids promote synapse growth Our data showed that elevation of the raft - related lipids MacCer and sterol facilitate NMJ overgrowth in Acsl mutants ( Fig . 6 ) . Moreover , MacCer promotes bouton formation in a pathway parallel to BMP signaling , at least in part ( Fig . 7 ) . It is unclear how these raft - related lipids regulate synaptic growth . It is likely that MacCer and sterol might interact with raft - associated growth signaling pathways . Larval NMJ development is mediated by multiple growth factors and downstream signaling cascades ( Collins and DiAntonio , 2007 ; Deshpande and Rodal , 2016 ) , some of which are activated or modulated by membrane lipid rafts ( Allen et al . , 2007 ; Hryniewicz - Jankowska et al . , 2014 ) . For instance , Wingless ( Wg ) ( Wnt1 in mammals ) is a raft - associated protein ( Zhai et al . , 2004 ) that activates signaling pathways essential for NMJ growth and synaptic differentiation ( Packard et al . , 2002 ) . It is therefore possible that the level or activity of some raft - associated growth factors is increased in Acsl mutants , thereby promoting NMJ overgrowth . Further investigation is needed to dissect the regulatory mechanisms of raft - related lipids , particularly MacCer , in promoting synaptic growth and bouton formation . It also would be of interest to address how Acsl - regulated lipids regulate neurotransmission in conjunction with synapse development . 4042 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2016 ) 129 , 4034 - 4045 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 195032 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e MATERIALS AND METHODS Drosophila stains and genetics Flies were cultured on standard cornmeal medium at 25°C . w 1118 was used as the wild type .

The following fly lines were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center : UAS - desat1 , UAS - desat1 - RNAi , UAS - GFP - SKL , UAS - mito - GFP , elav - Gal4 , nSyb - Gal4 , tub - Gal4 , act - Gal4 , OK6 - Gal4 , Mhc - Gal4 , dad j1E4 and rab11 93Bi . Immunohistochemical staining Immunostaining of larval preparations was performed as previously described ( Liu et al . , 2011 , 2014 ) . Specimens were dissected in Ca 2 + - free HL3 saline . For most antibody stainings , samples were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 30 – 60 min , and washed in 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . For MacCer staining , specimens were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in cold PBS , incubated with undiluted mouse monoclonal anti - MacCer hybridoma supernatants ( Hans Wandall , Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine , University of Copenhagen , Denmark ) ( Wandall et al . , 2005 ) for 18 h at 4°C and detected with Alexa - Fluor - 568 - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgM ( 1 : 1000 ; Invitrogen ) . Other antibodies used were : rabbit anti - pMad PS1 ( 1 : 500 ; Peter ten Dijke , Leiden University , Leiden , Netherlands ) ( Persson et al . , 1998 ) , mouse anti - CSP ( 1 : 300 ; 6D6 , DSHB ) , rat anti - KDEL ( 1 : 300 ; ab50601 ; Abcam ) , rabbit anti - GM130 ( 1 : 500 ; ab30637 ; Abcam ) , mouse anti - Myc ( 1 : 300 ; CW0259B ; CWBIO ) , rabbit anti - Myc ( 1 : 200 ; M047 - 3 ; MBL ) , mouse anti - Elav ( 1 : 100 ; 9F8A9 , DSHB ) , rat anti - GFP ( 1 : 300 ; D153 - 3 ; MBL ) and FITC - conjugated anti - horseradish - peroxidase ( HRP ; 1 : 200 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . Primaryantibodieswere visualizedusing specific secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 , Cy3 ( both at 1 : 1000 ; Invitrogen ) or DyLight 649 ( 1 : 500 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . Imaging and data analysis Images were collected with an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope using a 40×1 . 42 NA or 60×1 . 42 NA oil objective and FV10 - ASW software , or with a Leicaconfocal microscope using a 40×1 . 25 NA oil objective and LAS AF software . All images of muscle 4 type Ib NMJ from abdominal segments A2 or A3 fora specific experiment were captured using identical settings for statistical comparison among different genotypes . Brightness , contrast and color were adjusted using Photoshop CS5 ( Adobe ) . NMJ features were quantified using ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . For quantification of NMJ morphological phenotypes , individual boutons were defined according to the discrete staining signal of anti - CSP antibody . Satellite boutons were defined as extensions of five or fewer small boutons emanating from the main branch of the NMJ terminals ( Liu et al . , 2014 ) . For quantification of bouton sizes , synaptic areas ( μ m 2 ) were measured by assessing HRP - positive boutons , and normalized to bouton numbers . For quantification of MacCer and pMad levels , mean intensities of fluorescence were measured within HRP - positive NMJs , and normalized to that of HRP . These NMJ features were measured by an experimenter that was blind to the genotype . Statistical comparisons were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 . Data of NMJ features are expressed as mean±standard error of the mean ( s . e . m . ) . Statistical significance between each genotype and the controls was determined by a two - tailed Student ’ s t - test , whereas multiple comparison between genotypes was determined by one - way ANOVA with a Tukey post hoc test . Asterisks above a column indicate comparisons between a specific genotype and control , whereas asterisks above a bracket denote comparisons between two specific genotypes [ ns , not significant ( P > 0 . 05 ) ; * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; * * * P < 0 . 001 ] . Fatty acid analysis Fifty third - instar larval brains from a specific genotype were dissected and lysed in cold PBS . Fattyacids were trans - esterified by 2 . 5 % sulfuric acid and methanol . Samples were heated in an 80°C water bath for 2 h and cooled to room temperature , then 2 ml 0 . 9 % sodium chloride and 1 ml hexane was added , extracting fatty acyl methyl esters for analysis ( Christie , 1989 ) . Pentadecanoic acid ( C15 : 0 ; Sigma ) was used as an internal standard . GC - MS analysis of fatty acids was performed as previously described ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . Gas chromatography was performed using a BPX - 70 column ( 30 m by 0 . 25 mm , 0 . 25 μ m thickness ) . Peaks were assigned by using mass spectrometry ( Turbomass ) to identify fatty acids by both the retention time and fragmentation pattern . Quantification of each fatty acids was performed by an ANOVA non - parametric Kruskal – Wallis sum - of - ranks test for four biological repeats for each genotype ( no asterisk denotes P > 0 . 05 ; * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 ) . Lipidomics of larval brain Lipids extraction from 10 third - instar larval brains was carried out following the protocols described previously ( Lam et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly , lipids were extracted with 750 μ l of a chloroform and methanol mix ( 1 : 2 , v / v ) and vortexed for 1 min . The samples were placed on a thermomixer and shaken at 1000 rpm for 1 h at 4°C , then 250 μ l of chloroform and 350 μ l of deionized water were added and vortexed ; the lower organic phase was collected after centrifuging at 7600 g for 2 min . Lipidomic analysis was performed on an Agilent 1260 HPLC system coupled with a triple quadrupole and ion trap mass spectrometer ( 5500Qtrap , Sciex ) ( Lam et al . , 2014 ) . Individual lipid species were quantified by referencing to spiked internal standards ( Avanti Polar Lipids , Alabaster , AL , and Echelon Biosciences , Inc . Salt Lake City , UT ) . For all HPLC - MS analyses , individual peaks were manually examined and only peaks above the limit of quantification and within the linearity range were used for quantification . Quantification of each lipid species was performed by an ANOVA non - parametric Kruskal – Wallis sum - of - ranks test for five biological repeats for each genotype ( no asterisk denotes P > 0 . 05 , * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 ) .
