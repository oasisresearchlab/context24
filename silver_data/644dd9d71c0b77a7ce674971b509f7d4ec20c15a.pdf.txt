VAN DE VEN ANDRE L . DELBECQ The Wharton School University of Wisconsin - Madison University of Pennsylvania RICHARD KOENIG , JR . Kent State University American Sociological Review 1976 , Vol . 41 ( April ) : 322 - 338 This paper classifies alternative mechanisms for coordinating work activities within organiza - tions into impersonal , personal and group modes . It investigates how variations and interactions in the use of these coordination mechanisms and modes are explained by task uncertainty , interdependence and unit size . Nine hypotheses that relate these three determining factors to the use of the three coordination modes are developed in order to test some key propositions of Thompson ( 1967 ) and others on coordination at the work unit or departmental level of organi - zation analysis . Research results from 197 work units within a large employment security agency largely support the hypotheses . The findings suggest that there are differences in degree and kind of influence of each determining factor on the mix of alternative coordination mecha - nisms used within organizational units . Basic to a theory of organizations is the premise that all organizations need coordina - tion . Coordination means integrating or link - ing together different parts of an organization to accomplish a collective set of tasks . Differ - ent levels of analysis and perspective have been taken to study coordination . Most or - ganization sociologists have studied manager - ial coordination at the organizational level of analysis ( e . g . , Blau , 1968 ; Thompson , 1967 ; Meyer , 1972 ; Hage , 1974 ; Heydebrand , 1973 ) . In this sense , mehcanisms for coor - dinating task roles within work units or de - * We are grateful to the Wisconsin Employment Security Division in the Department of Industry , Labor and Human Relations for support of this re - search .

Yet it is within work units or depart - ments where the majority of instrumental functions are performed ( Parsons , 1962 ) . Fur - ther , while many researchers have followed Weber ( 1947 ) by measuring the degrees of structural integration in terms of complexity , centralization , formalization or socialization , few ( Hage , 1974 ; Galbraith , 1970 ) have pur - sued the redirections offered by March and Simon ( 1958 ) and Thompson ( 1967 ) for con - ceptualizing and measuring processes of co - ordination . This paper will attempt to focus upon co - ordination processes and test some key propo - sitions of Thompson ( 1967 ) and others about coordination at the work unit level of organi - zation analysis . Three alternative modes for coordinating work activities will be presented ( impersonal , personal and group ) . The re - search will examine the extent to which task uncertainty , task interdependence and unit size predict variations in the use of the three modes of coordination . 322 This content downloaded from 193 . 140 . 42 . 142 on Fri , 1 Nov 2013 09 : 56 : 15 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions MODES OF COORDINATION IN ORGANIZATIONS 323 ALTERNATIVE MODES OF COORDINATION According to March and Simon ( 1958 ) , there are two general ways in which organiza - tions can be coordinated : ( 1 ) by programming or ( 2 ) by feedback . For our purposes , we will classify all forms of coordination by programming as an imper - sonal coordination mode . Coordination by programming is a clear construct exemplified by such integrating mechanisms as the use of pre - established plans , schedules , forecasts , formalized rules , policies and procedures , and standardized information and communication systems . The common element of each of these exemplary mechanisms is that a codified blueprint of action is impersonally specified . Departures from the blueprint are immediate - ly obvious and human discretion does not en - ter into the determination of what , where , when and how roles are to be articulated to accomplish a given set of tasks ( March and Simon , 1958 ) ; rather , roles and their articula - tion are formally prescribed in impersonal , standardized blueprints or action programs ( Thompson , 1967 ) . In addition , since these impersonal mechanisms of coordination are codified , once implemented their use requires minimal verbal communication between task performers ( Galbraith , 1970 ; 1973 ) . Coordination by feedback , however , is a less crystallized construct . Thompson ( 1967 : 56 ) defines coordination by feedback as mutual adjustments based upon new infor - mation . Two operational modes for develop - ing plans and making mutual adjustments are frequently used in organizations : a personal mode and a group mode . In the personal mode , individual role occupants serve as the mechanism for making mutual task adjust - ments through either vertical or horizontal channels of communication . In the group mode , the mechanism for mutual adjustment is vested in a group of role occupants through scheduled or unscheduled staff or committee meetings . Within the personal mode , patterns of ver - tical and horizontal communications have re - ceived much attention for evaluating coor - dination processes in organizational literature ( Hall , 1972 : 275 ) . The mechanisms for vertical communication are usually line managers and unit supervisors ( Thompson , 1967 ) . When horizontal channels are used , the linkage func - tion is assumed by an individual unit member who communicates directly with other role actors on a one - to - one basis in a non - hier - archical relationship . Alternatively , Lawrence and Lorsch ( 1967 ) suggest non - hierarchical coordination may be vested in a designated coordinator , integrator or project expeditor who has no formal authority over the indi - viduals whose activities require coordination . Within the group mode , Hage et al . ( 1971 ) make the distinction between scheduled and unscheduled meetings . The former is used for the more routine , usually planned communi - cations such as staff or committee meetings ; the latter is used for unplanned communica - tions , such as informal , impromptu con - ferences between more than two staff mem - bers about a work - related problem ( Hage , 1974 : 151 ) . In summary , three predominant modes are frequently used to coordinate work activities within an organization . Coordination by pro - gramming is exercised through an impersonal mode , while feedback or mutual adjustments occur through either personal ( vertical or hori - zontal ) channels or group ( scheduled or un - scheduled ) meetings . Simple observations and experiences in or - ganizational life suggest that each of the specific mechanisms for coordination in each mode are used often , and in various combina - tions , to achieve integration of a collective set of activities . The more interesting question , which we turn to now , is to identify which situational factors determine when one or a combination of these mechanisms are used . DETERMINANTS OF COORDINATION MODES Classically , impersonal and vertical mecha - nisms have been advocated as the most effi - cient and rational means for coordination , while use of horizontal communication mechanisms and group meetings are at vari - ance with prescribed administrative practice ( Fayol , 1949 ; Urwick , 1943 ; Weber , 1947 ) .

Further , research by organization sociologists ( e . g . , Rosengren , 1964 ; Blau , 1968 ; Carzo and Yanouzas , 1969 ; Tannenbaum , 1974 ) and social psychologists ( e . g . , Bavelas , 1950 ; Shaw , 1964 ) suggest there are potential benefits ( e . g . , efficiency , corrective feedback , speedy conflict resolu - tion and quality in task performance ) and costs ( e . g . , information omission , distortion , overload and low motivation ) in the use of any specific coordination mechanism . Thus , variations in the use of coordination mechanisms within organizations are not ex - plained solely by administrative prescriptions . There are a set of more fundamental factors which may explain the use of alternative mechanisms for coordination ; and this re - search will examine task uncertainty , inter - dependence and unit size . Task Uncertainty Task uncertainty refers to the difficulty and variability of the work undertaken by an organizational unit . Task variability has been operationalized as the number of work excep - tions encountered by a unit ( Perrow , 1967 ) . Alternatively , Hall ( 1972 ) measures variability as the sameness of work from day to day , the variety in methods and the repetitiveness of task processes . Task difficulty has been measured as the analyzability of the work and predictability of work methods . Alternative measures are : ( 1 ) the degree of complexity of the search processes ; ( 2 ) the amount of think - ing time to solve problems ( Perrow , 1967 ) ; ( 3 ) the extent to which task processes or interven - tions have knowable outcomes ( Thompson , 1967 ; Burns and Stalker , 1961 ) ; ( 4 ) the amount of time required before outcomes are known ( Lefton and Rosengren , 1966 ) . Taken together , task difficulty and variability con - stitute the major dimensions of task uncer - tainty at the work unit level . Research has found that if the work under - taken by an organizational unit is analyzable and non - variable , most of the task activities can be standardized and programmed ( Litwak , 1961 ; Hall , 1972 ; Perrow , 1970 ) . However , as the task increases in uncertainty , it becomes more difficult to coordinate by impersonal means . This can be due to a greater number of exceptional cases arising ( March and Simon , 1958 ; Thompson , 1967 ) or to encountering tasks more difficult to analyze . If the task is not well understood , then during the process of task execution there is learning which leads to changes in role allocations , schedules and priorities ( Galbraith , 1973 ; Perrow , 1967 ) . In the extreme case , a high level of uncertainty may require that mutual adjustments be ac - complished by group judgments ( Van de Ven and Delbecq , 1974 ) . This leads to the follow - ing hypotheses : A . Increases in the degree of task uncer - tainty for an organizational unit is as - sociated with 1 . a lower use of the impersonal coor - dination mode 2 . a greater use of the personal coordi - nation mode 3 . a significantly greater use of the group coordination mode . Task Interdependence Interdependence at the work unit level of analysis is the extent to which unit personnel are dependent upon one another to perform their individual jobs . Mohr ( 1971 ) defines in - terdependence as the extent to which work unit members have one - person jobs and the degree of collaboration required among unit members to produce or deliver the finished product or service of the unit . Thus , the fewer the one - person jobs and the greater the degree of task - related collaboration , the greater the interdependence . Pennings ( 1974 ) , however , points out that interdependence is a very difficult concept to define , both theoretically and empirically . For Pennings , the concept involves at least four different bases of interconnectedness between unit personnel : task ( the flow of work be - tween actors ) , role ( the position of actors en - This content downloaded from 193 . 140 . 42 . 142 on Fri , 1 Nov 2013 09 : 56 : 15 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions MODES OF COORDINATION IN ORGANIZATIONS 325 gaged in concerted action ) , social ( mutual needs or goals of actors ) and knowledge ( the differentiated expertise of actors ) . From this perspective , Mohr ' s ( 1971 ) definition and measures of task interdependence should be seen as focusing upon role interdependence . Thompson ( 1967 : 54 - 65 ) defines interde - pendence in terms of work flow and suggests that it be measured by focusing upon the flow of work , materials and objects between unit personnel . Hickson et al . ( 1969 ) have referred to this as " operations technology . " Building upon Thompson , a hierarchy of increasing levels of task interdependence between unit personnel can be determined by observing whether the work flow is ( 1 ) independent ( Thompson calls this " pooled " ) , ( 2 ) sequen - tial , ( 3 ) reciprocal or ( 4 ) in a team arrange - ment . Because the team arrangement is an ex - tension of Thompson ' s three work flow strate - gies , we will elaborate on the concept . Team work flow refers to situations where the work is undertaken jointly by unit person - nel who diagnose , problem - solve and collabo - rate in order to complete the work . In team work flow , there is no measurable temporal lapse in the flow of work between unit mem - bers , as there is in the sequential and recipro - cal cases ; the work is acted upon jointly and simultaneously by unit personnel at the same point in time . Examples of team work flow in organizational units include group therapy ses - sions in mental health units , a sports team playing a game and a group of research col - leagues designing a study as a " think tank . " ( See Appendix for further illustration and description of measurement procedures of the four alternative work flow strategies . ) Thompson ( 1967 : 54 - 65 ) theorized that a hierarchical relationship exists between the type of work flow interdependence : pooled must exist before sequential , and sequential must exist before reciprocal forms of inter - dependence . A similar hierarchy exists be - tween the type of coordination mechanisms ; with programming first , plans and schedules second and mutual adjustments third . As task interdependence increases , more elaborate co - ordination mechanisms are required to link or - ganizational units . Specifically , pooled inter - dependence causes standardization , sequential interdependence causes planning and schedul - ing and intensive interdependence causes mutual adjustments . For example , the simplest and least costly method of coordinating independent work flow in a unit is to specify impersonally the behaviors to be followed by each role actor in advance of their execution ( March and Simon , 1958 ) . However , Galbraith ( 1973 ) suggests that rules and plans have limited information processing capacities . As the unit members un - dertake tasks that require increasing amounts of collaboration ( e . g . , shifts in work flow from independent to sequential to reciprocal ) , an increasing need arises for hierarchy in ad - dition to impersonal coordination . In this case , recurring job situations are programmed , while exceptions are referred to higher levels of authority . This combination of mechanisms is functional within their limited capacities to process information . As the number of mutual adjustments increase , still more elaborate co - ordination mechanisms are required . Horizon - tal direct contact between unit members and group modes ( when a number of actors need simultaneous feedback to make adjustments ) will be added while the capacity and sophis - tication of impersonal and personal coordina - tion modes will be expanded . Although there is always a problem in mov - ing from an evolutionary theory to cross - sectional hypotheses , the key idea suggested by Thompson ( 1967 ) and Galbraith ( 1973 ) is that impersonal , personal and group coordina - tion modes are additive linkage mechanisms as work flow interdependence increases . This leads to the following hypotheses : B . Increases in work flow interdependence from independent to sequential to re - ciprocal to team arrangements will be associated with 1 . small increases in use of impersonal coordination mechanisms 2 . moderate increases in use of personal coordination mechanisms 3 . large increases in use of group coordi - nation mechanisms .

Many researchers have investigated the rela - tionship between total organization size and a number of structural dimensions ( see Child , 1973 for a review ) . In general , increases in size increase structural differentiation at decreas - ing rates ( Blau , 1971 : 204 ) . This produces a corresponding tradeoff between increasing the complexity and cost of coordination at the aggregate administrative level and decreasing the coordination burden within work units be - cause activities within units tend to become more homogeneous . However , the relationship between unit size and unit coordination is not clearly known . Small group researchers who have treated size as an independent variable have measured its effects on a number of properties relevant to coordination . As size increases : ( 1 ) group cohesiveness decreases and sub - group formation increases ( Miller , 1952 ; Jennings , 1960 ) ; ( 2 ) member participation decreases more mechanical methods are used to intro - duce information and more direct attempts are made to control the behaviors of partici - pants in reaching a solution ( Hare , 1962 : 240 ) ; ( 3 ) face - to - face techniques of leadership be - havior give way to more impersonal tech - niques of coordination ( Van de Ven , 1975 ) ; ( 4 ) demands on the leaders become more complex and numerous , and group members become more tolerant of highly structured and directive leadership ( Hemphill , 1950 ; Maas , 1950 ) . These research findings suggest the following hypotheses : C . An increase in work unit size is associ - ated with 1 . a decrease in use of group coordina - tion 2 . an increase in use of personal coordi - nation 3 . a significant increase in use of imper - sonal coordination mechanisms . The direction of the relationships between work unit size and the three coordination modes is therefore hypothesized to be in an opposite direction from that of task uncer - tainty and task interdependence . As task un - certainty and interdependence increase , the use of personal and group modes of coordina - tion will increase . The inverse of this direction of relationships is predicted for work unit size . RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Research Design The data reported here to test the hy - potheses were collected in 1972 in 16 district offices and the administrative headquarters of a large state employment security ( ES ) agency . ' The sample consisted of 197 formal work units ( officially designated in the organi - zation chart ) from the local and administra - tive levels of the ES agency . For research pur - poses , a formal work unit was defined as con - sisting of a supervisor and all non - supervisory personnel immediately reporting to the super - visor . Only stable and established work units were included in the sample . Work units in the transitionary stage ( due to supervisory turn - over , major changes in working operations , etc . ) were excluded . The data were collected by on - site administration of questionnaires to the supervisors and all members for each work unit . Questionnaires were completed by 197 unit supervisors and 880 unit personnel . Ad - ditionally , a standardized follow - up interview was conducted with each unit supervisor . Measurement Multiple - item indices as well as parallel in - dices were constructed to measure task uncer - tainty , task interdependence and unit size . Operational measures and procedures used to test the reliability and validity of the measures are presented in a Measurement Appendix . 1 A detailed description of the composition of state employment security agencies and of the work units within such an organization is available in Blau and Schoenherr ( 1971 ) and therefore needs no re - statement here .

" These questions were answered by re - spondents only after each coordination mech - anism was defined and clearly described . In addition , the unit supervisors were asked to qualitatively indicate the specific circum - stances when each coordination mechanism was used . Composite indices of impersonal , personal and group coordination modes then were constructed by averaging the items under the heading listed above . Organizational unit scores were obtained by assigning equal weights to responses of unit supervisors ( 1 / 2 ) and unit members ( 1 / 2 ) as discussed by Hage and Aiken ( 1967 : 76 - 7 ) .

A closer examination of the per - sonal coordination mechanisms , however , shows that as task uncertainty increases , the use of vertical communication channels re - mains invariant ; while the use of horizontal channels increases significantly . These results suppport the theoretical conclusions drawn by March and Simon ( 1958 ) , Thompson ( 1967 ) and Perrow ( 1970 ) that as the task encoun - tered by a unit becomes less analyzable and more variable , a greater number of mutual ad - justments are required among unit members . A clearer illustration of these relationships is presented in Figure 1 which shows a profile of the mean uses of the coordination mecha - nisms for the units that were classified into low , medium and high levels of task uncer - tainty ( as described in the Appendix ) . Figure 1 shows that as task uncertainty increases from low to high there are substantial de - creases in the use of impersonal rules and plans for work coordination , large increases in the use of horizontal communication channels and both scheduled and unscheduled group Table 2 .

However , the use of vertical hier - archy remains quite stable over the task uncer - tainty range . By definition , each of the units included in the sample had a supervisor , and the extent to which the supervisor is used to coordinate work activities within the unit does not appear to vary much with task uncer - tainty . The graph in Figure 1 suggests that as task uncertainty increases , horizontal channels and group meetings are substituted for , or increas - ingly replace , the impersonal mode of coor - dination . A substitution or tradeoff effect im - plies that the significant negative zero - order correlations between impersonal coordination and group meeting ( r = - . 32 ) and between im - personal coordination and horizontal com - munications ( r - - . 30 ) are explained by vari - ations in task uncertainty . One indicator of this " substitution effect " of task uncertainty is that the partial correlations between imper - sonal coordination and the other horizontal and group mechanisms should vanish when controlling for task uncertainty .

Indeed , the partial correlations between rules , plans and the other coordination mechanisms ( except ver - tical channels ) were all found to be near . 00 when controlling for task uncertainty . The in - terested reader can compute these partial cor - relations directly from Table 1 . These interesting findings indicate ( but do not demonstrate ) that the tradeoffs or nega - tive relationshps between impersonal coordi - nation and horizontal and group mechanisms are " explained " by task uncertainty . These cross - sectional indications of a substitution ef - fect of task uncertainty on the use of alterna - tive coordination mechanisms warrant further , more controlled laboratory research .

The profile of the average uses of the coordination mechanisms on task interdependence shown in Figure 2 , however , suggest that the relation - ships may not be linear . 3 Figure 2 shows that as task interdepen - dence increases , there is an overall greater use of all coordination mechanisms combined ( the grand mean ) .

Over Thompson ' s range of pooled , sequen - tial and reciprocal work flows are the relationships with coordination mechanisms concave or convex ? Alternatively , do pooled , sequential , reciprocal and team work flows , in that order , assume a Guttman - like scale of increasing interdependence as Thomp - son suggests ? Clearly , further research is needed to test for curvilinearity of the relationships and the Guttman - like characteristics of the work flow inter - dependence scale . dination mechanisms except impersonal rules and plans over the range from pooled to se - quential to reciprocal work flows . Thus , the only significant exception to Thompson ' s " ad - ditive " hypothesis in this study is the decrease in impersonal coordination mechanisms be - tween sequential and reciprocal work flows . Our extension of Thompson ' s work flows with the team arrangement provides a clue on the range over which the additive effect of interdependence holds . When moving from re - ciprocal to team work flows , there are in - creases in the average uses of all the coordina - tion mechanisms except for plans and hier - archy . Overall , therefore , with minor excep - tions , Thompson ' s additive hypothesis appears to hold up quite well at intensive levels of interdependence . Equally important is the hierarchical pat - tern in the use of coordination mechanisms that is apparent with variations in task uncer - tainty ( Figure 1 ) , interdependence ( Figure 2 ) and unit size ( Figure 3 ) . One of Thompson ' s ( 1967 : 57 ) key propositions is that under norms of rationality , organizations will struc - This content downloaded from 193 . 140 . 42 . 142 on Fri , 1 Nov 2013 09 : 56 : 15 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions MODES OF COORDINATION IN ORGANIZATIONS 331 = To Great 9 d Extent 8 _ ( U I To Much 7 - 0 Extent U ) i 6 _ Cd To Some S .

Profile of Coordination Mechanisms on Unit Size ture themselves so as to minimize coordina - tion costs . Although Thompson was referring to aggregate organization design , the data here suggest support for the same proposition at the work unit level . Impersonal , personal and group mechanisms are increasingly more cost - ly forms of coordination . Figures 1 - 3 show that impersonal rules and plans , being the least costly mechanisms to operate , are used the most . Horizontal channels and group meetings , being classically viewed as the most inefficient and costly mechanisms for coor - dination are used the least overall ; and as March and Simon ( 1958 ) suggest , their use in - creases significantly only at higher levels of task uncertainty and interdependence where mutual adjustments to task situations cannot be predetermined or programmed . Finally , the use of hierarchy , relative to other mecha - nisms , remains constant throughout as a coor - dination mechanism for dealing with excep - tions . Work Unit Size and Coordination The direction of the relationships between work unit size and coordination mechanisms are all in the hypothesized direction . Table 2 shows that as unit size increases , the use of impersonal coordination increases significant - ly ; the use of hierarchy increases , but to a smaller degree ; while the use of horizontal channels and group meetings remains invariant with work unit size . Figure 3 shows that over the range of unit size from 2 - 10 people , the findings are consis - tent with small group studies indicating that as size increases , more mechanical techniques are used to introduce information , and more direct leader attempts are made to control the behaviors of participants through hierarchy ( Hare , 1962 : 240 ) . However , beyond size 10 , the use of hierarchy decreases and even great - er use is made of rules , policies and pro - cedures to coordinate work activities . Beyond 10 people , an impersonalizing effect of large unit size appears to become prominent . This finding within work units at the micro - level parallels nicely with the macro - level findings by Blau ( 1970 ) and Hickson et al . ( 1969 ) that with increasing organization size , reliance on hierarchy decreases and formalization in - creases .

As tasks increase in uncertainty , mutual work adjustments through horizontal com - munication channels and group meetings are used in lieu of coordination through hierarchy and impersonal programming . This substitu - tion between alternative coordination mecha - nisms appears to be the major effect associ - ated with task uncertainty . Associated with increases in work flow in - terdependence among unit personnel is an ad - ditive use of all coordination mechanisms , ex - cept for impersonal rules and plans over the sequential - reciprocal work flow range . An in - creased use in all coordination mechanisms combined is also observed as interdependence increases . At intensive levels of work flow in - terdependence ( the team arrangement ) , Thompson ' s additive hypothesis continues to hold up quite well with the exception of a slight decrease in the use of hierarchy and a large decrease in the use of plans for coordi - nating activities within organizational units . Unit size , on the other hand , appears to have an impersonalizing effect on coordina - tion . As unit size increases , there is a greater use of impersonal coordination and of hier - archy . It is important to note that increases in size are not directly associated with a corres - ponding decreasing use of group coordination mechanisms as was hypothesized and then suggested by the zero - order correlations . The regression coefficients in Table 2 show that the use of horizontal communication channels and group meetings are invariant with respect to size . Further , as unit size increases beyond 10 people , the use of hierarchy decreases . It appears , therefore , that size has an imperson - alizing effect on the kind of coordination mechanisms used within a work unit . It must be recognized that the data do not warrant proof or disproof of the cause and effect relationships implied in the above dis - cussion . Future studies need to examine not only the degree of impact but also the dif - ferent kinds of impact of task uncertainty , task interdependence and work unit size on alternative coordination mechanisms . Finally , we evaluate the comparative strengths of the three independent variables in explaining variations in the coordination mechanisms . When comparing the relative weights of the standardized regression coeffi - cients across the columns in Table 2 , one is struck by the strength of the contributions of task uncertainty in explaining variations in the use of the coordination mechanisms within the work units and the overall insignificance of size . This finding is contrary to the conclu - sion drawn by Mohr ( 1971 : 452 ) that " 4the technological imperative has not been sup - ported " at the work unit level and supports the suggestions made by Hickson et al . ( 1969 : 395 ) , Fullan ( 1970 ) and Aldrich ( 1972 ) that technology has a greater influence than size at the work unit or " shop - floor " level . The coefficients of determination ( R2 ) in the far right column of Table 2 suggests that , while there is much room for improvement , the three situational factors are quite good predictors . Task uncertainty , interdependence and size , as a group , account for substantial variations in the use of all coordination mechanisms , except hierarchy . The use of ver - tical channels is not significantly explained by any of the independent variables . At the unit , level , hierarchy is structurally pre - established and it remains as the only stable mechanism of coordination while the use of all other mechanisms vary under different unit condi - tions . Of course , the findings presented here are limited to the work unit or departmental level within a large state employment security agency . To generalize the findings , future re - search is required to replicate this study in other organizations . To extend and make more complete our understanding of coordi - nation within organizations , future research should also examine the managerial level ( Par - sons , 1962 ) as the unit of analysis and investi - This content downloaded from 193 . 140 . 42 . 142 on Fri , 1 Nov 2013 09 : 56 : 15 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions MODES OF COORDINATION IN ORGANIZATIONS 333 gate the use of alternative mechanisms for co - ordination across work units and levels within organizations . APPENDIX MEASUREMENT OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES I . Index of Task Uncertainty Task uncertainty is defined as the difficulty and variability of the work that is under - taken by an organizational unit . In order to test for validity , two approaches were used to measure task uncertainty : a percep - tual questionnaire approach and a stan - dardized classification of tasks . A . Perceptual Questionnaire Approach Perceived task uncertainty was measur - ed in the questionnaire as the average response of all unit personnel to the fol - lowing eight questions : * 1 . To what extent is there a clearly de - fined body of knowledge or subject matter which can guide you in doing your work ? ( Unit X = 4 . 2 ; o = 2 . 4 ; Range = 1 - 10 ; Spv - Mbr Response r = . 50 ) 2 . During the course of your work , how often do you come across specific but difficult problems that you don ' t know how to solve , and you have to take some time to think through by yourself or with others before you can take any action ? ( Unit X = 5 . 3 ; o = 2 . 0 ; Range = 1 - 10 ; Spv - Mbr Re - sponse r = . 55 ) 3 . In general , how much actual " think - ing " time do you usually spend try - ing to solve such specific problems ? ( Unit X = 3 . 5 ; o = 2 . 3 ; Range = 1 - 10 ; Spv - Mbr Response r = . 56 ) 4 . In some jobs things are fairly pre - dictable . In others , you are often not sure what the outcome will be . What percent of the time would you say that you are generally sure what the results of your efforts will be ? ( Unit X = 3 . 8 ; o = 2 . 0 ; Range = 1 - 10 ; Spv - Mbr Response r = . 55 ) 5 . In terms of the major tasks you are assigned , on the average how long is it before you know whether your work effort is successful ? ( Unit X = 5 . 1 ; o = 1 . 7 ; Range = 1 - 9 ; Spv - Mbr Response r = . 66 ) 6 . How much variety in cases , claims , clients , or things do you generally en - counter in your normal working day ? ( Unit X = 6 . 8 ; o = 2 . 0 ; Range = 1 - 10 ; SpvMbr Response r = . 70 ) 7 . Regardless of the variety of cases , claims , or clients , to what extent are the activities or methods you follow in your work about the same for dealing with classes of categories of cases , claims , or clients ? ( Unit X = 4 . 8 ; o = 2 . 3 ; Range = 1 - 10 ; Spv - Mbr Response r = . 64 ) 8 . To what extent do people in this unit do about the same job in the same way most of the time ? ( Unit X = 4 . 6 ; o = 2 . 4 ; Range = 1 - 10 ; Spv - Mbr Re - sponse r = . 71 ) * Below each item is listed the mean , standard deviation and response range for all units , as well as the zero - order correlation between the response of the unit supervisor and the average responses of the unit members . B . Standardized Classification of Tasks Ap - proach In order to test the validity of the per - ceptual measurement approach , a classi - fication of tasks into levels of uncertain - ty ( i . e . , task difficulty and variability ) was used to measure task uncertainty in a standardized , non - perceptual way . The procedures for classifying the work of units into levels was a follows : 1 . All unit personnel were asked in the questionnaires to list the specific tasks they perform in a normal day , as well as the percent of time spent on each task . 2 . The population of tasks was edited for duplication and classified into levels of high , medium and low task difficulty and task variability .

The predominant task requiring the most time of personnel in each unit was then scored according to its level of task difficulty and variability . 4 . Individual scores on task difficulty and variability were then averaged for each unit to obtain the unit task uncertainty score . ( Unit X = 2 . 0 ; o = . 6 ; Range = 1 - 3 ) C . Reliability and Validity of Task Uncer - tainty 1 . Using coefficient alpha , the reliabil - ity of the perceptual task uncertainty measure is . 92 . 2 . The correlation between perceptual and classified indices of task uncer - tainty is . 84 . 3 . The correlation between the classi - fied task difficulty and classified task variability score is . 58 . Overall , then , these findings suggest good reliability for the perceptual index of task uncertainty , good content validity when comparing the perceptual and classified indices and substantial dis - criminant validity to the sub - indices of task difficulty and task variability con - tained within the composite task uncer - tainty index . [ I . Task Interdependence Index Task interdependence is defined as the work flow interconnectedness of unit per - sonnel in performing their individual jobs . In order to test for validity , two ap - proaches were used to measure task inter - dependence ; one is an extension of Thomp - son ' s ( 1967 ) work flows , and the other is based on Mohr ' s ( 1971 ) measures of task interdependence . A . Work Flow Interdependence Index Thompson ( 1967 ) presented three alter - native ways work can flow between units : pooled ( which we call indepen - dent ) , sequential and reciprocal . We added a fourth possible strategy , team work flow , in order to measure the al - ternative possible flows of work be - tween unit personnel . In the 197 inter - views with unit supervisors , the follow - ing questions were asked to measure work flow interdependence . Please indicate what percent of the total work within your unit flows in each of the ways as shown by this figure ( show work flow figure to supervisor ) , and as I will now describe . 1 . Independent Work Flow Case , where work and activities are performed by your immediate subordinates in - dependently and do not flow be - tween them . Work Enters Unit I - I11 Work Leaves Unit ( Unit X = 64 . 2 ; o = 30 . 5 ; Range = 0 - 99 ) 2 . Sequential Work Flow Case , where work and activities flow between your immediate subordinates , but only in one direction . Work Enters Work Leaves ( Unit X = 12 . 2 ; o = 20 . 7 ; Range = 0 - 99 ) 3 . Reciprocal Work Flow Case , where work and activities flow between your immediate subordinates in a re - ciprocal " back and forth " manner over a period of time . This content downloaded from 193 . 140 . 42 . 142 on Fri , 1 Nov 2013 09 : 56 : 15 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions MODES OF COORDINATION IN ORGANIZATIONS 335 Work Enters Work Leaves ( Unit X = 17 . 7 ; o = 22 . 5 ; Range = 0 - 99 ) 4 . Team Work Flow Case , where work and activities come into your unit and your immediate subordinates diagnose , problem - solve and collabo - rate as a group at the SAME TIME to deal with the work . Work Enters Work Leaves ( Unit X = 6 . 0 ; o = 9 . 1 ; Range = 0 - 99 ) For each work flow case that the unit super - visor said represented 30 percent of the work flow within the unit , a series of six questions was asked to validate the supervisor ' s response as well as to obtain qualitative understanding of unit processes in each work flow case . Following Thompson ' s ( 1967 ) suggestion , we assume that independent , sequential , recipro - cal and team work flows , in order , imply in - creasing levels of task interdependence in the form of a Guttman scale . Ideally , therefore , the responses of unit supervisor to each work flow case could be weighted to arrive at an overall measure of task interdependence . Un - fortunately , we cannot test the Guttman - like characteristics of such a scale directly because responses were forced to add up to 100 per - cent , which forces substitutions rather than additive responses . A more rudimentary measure of work flow interdependence is therefore being reported here . Independent , sequential , reciprocal and team work flow cases were assigned values of 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , respectively . The scaled value cor - responding to the most predominant work flow case in each unit is being used here as the measurement of task interdependence . B . Mohr Task Interdependence Index In order to test the validity of the Work - flow Interdependence Index , two ques - tions , which are based on Mohr ' s ( 1971 ) index , were asked of all unit personnel to measure task interdependence in a different way . The two questions were included in the questionnaire and an - swered along a ten - point scale : 1 . To what extent do the people in this unit have one - person jobs : that is , in order to get the work out to what extent do unit members indepen - dently accomplish their own assigned tasks ? ( Unit X = 3 . 6 ; o = 2 . 4 ; Range = 1 - 10 ; Spv - Mbr Response r = . 35 ) 2 . To what extent do all the unit mem - bers meet together to discuss how each task , case , or claim should be performed or treated in order to do the work in this unit ? ( Unit X = 3 . 3 ; o = 2 . 7 ; Range = 1 - 10 ; Spv - Mbr Re - sponse r = . 65 ) C . Reliability and Validity of Task Inter - dependence 1 . The correlation between the two items in the Mohr index is . 72 . 2 . The correlation between the work flow and Mohr independence indices is . 59 . 3 . In order to present some insight on the characteristics of the work flow index , listed below are the means and standard deviations of the Mohr in - dex on the four work flow cases .

Further , if the two indices measure the same construct , then the diagram above suggests that the work flow index violates the properties of a Guttman scale for independent and sequential work flow cases . A reverse of the two work flow cases would result in a systematic increase in the means of the Mohr scale from 2 . 5 ( sequential ) , 2 . 8 ( independent ) , 4 . 4 ( reciprocal ) , to 7 . 1 ( team work flow ) . This , however , is not an ade - quate test of the Guttman - like characteristics of the work flow in - dex . Clearly , further research on the measurement of interdependence is needed . III . Measurement of Unit Size Two approaches were also used to measure unit size : from organization charts and from organization records . A . Measure of Unit Size from Organization Charts The most conventional approach ( e . g . , Blau and Schoenherr , 1971 ; Hickson et al . , 1969 ; Hall , 1972 ) is a count of the number of people in the organization - usually from organization charts . To measure work unit size , we first con - structed up - to - date organization charts for each unit and verified them in the interviews with unit supervisors . The unit charts included , but distinguished between , full - time and part - time em - ployees . Work unit size was then mea - sured by adding each full - time employee as 1 and each part - time employee as ' / 2 in arriving at the total unit size . ( Unit X = 5 . 8 ; o = 3 . 7 ; Range = 1 - 21 ) B . Measure of Unit Size from Organization Fiscal Records To test the validity of the above ap - proach , data were obtained from the Budget and Fiscal Bureau of the agency on the number of equivalent positions salaried during the fiscal year in each unit . C . Validity of Unit Size Measure The correlation between the organiza - tion chart and fiscal records measures of size is . 97 , which is very good . However , if one only counts the number of full - time employees from the organization charts and does not include part - time employees , the correlation drops to . 81 , suggesting that it was important to in - clude and weigh by 1 / 2 part - time em - ployees in a measurement of unit size from organization charts in this employ - ment security agency . Questionnaire Administration The questionnaires were personally ad - ministered to all members of each work unit present at the time of the site visit by the research team . In all cases , the work unit supervisors completed the questionnaire . Re - spondents filled out the questionnaire only af - ter a member of research team verbally ex - plained the nature of the research study , the meaning of the questionnaire items and an - swered all questions respondents might have .

An available conference or testing room was used in order that respondents could leave their work stations and not be in - terrupted while completing the question - naires . A member of the research team was available at all times to answer questions while respondents completed the questionnaires .

REWARDS , RESOURCES , AND THE RATE OF MOBILITY : A NONSTATIONARY MULTIVARIATE STOCHASTIC MODEL * NANCY BRANDON TUMA Stanford University American Sociological Review 1976 , Vol . 41 ( April ) : 338 - 360 Most research on social mobility has concentrated either on identifying the causes of status attainment or on describing a population ' s movement over time by means of a stochastic ( usually Markov ) model . Viewing mobility as a semi - Markov process suggests that the rate of mobility is a proper object of explanation , and the status attainment literature suggests substan - tive determinants . In particular , I argue that the rate at which a person leaves a job declines with duration in the job and depends on initial levels of job rewards , stationary and changing individual resources , and on the distribution of rewards and resources in the social system . Results from testing the proposed model with data on 1609 jobs of 456 different Chicano men support most points of the argument . The sociological study of social mobility has had two major traditions . One tradition inquires into the causes of social attainment ; * I am grateful to Thomas Cdnnor , Michael Han - nan , Neil Henry and Alice Young for research sugges - tions ; to Harvey Choldin and Grafton Trout for sup - plying the data ; to Margaret Wright for programming aid ; to Stanford University for computer funds ; and to Michael Hannan , Anne McMahon , Carolyn Mullins and Alice Young for editorial comments . it seeks to identify the characteristics of indi - viduals , social positions and the social system that affect the allocation of scarce values like prestige and wealth ( see , e . g . , Rogoff , 1953 ; Blau and Duncan , 1967 ) . The second tradition examines the form of the social mobility pro - cess ; it tries to describe the way in which the movement of a population among social posi - tions unfolds over time ( see , e . g . , Prais , 1955a ; 1955b ; Blumen et al . , 1955 ) .
