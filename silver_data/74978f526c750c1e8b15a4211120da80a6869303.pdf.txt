Our results are in excellent agreement with recent computer simulations and reproduces important qualitatively interesting features observed in simulations of polymers of intermediate lengths . We also make a number of predictions that can be tested in a variety of concrete experimental realizations . The expected level of ﬁnite size ﬂuctuations in force - extension curves is also estimated . This study is relevant to mechanical properties of biological molecules . PACS numbers : 87 . 45 - k , 05 . 40 + j , 36 . 20 - r Many biologically important molecules , like DNA and Actin , are semi - ﬂexible polymers [ 1 ] . In recent years there have been experiments [ 2 ] which pull and stretch single molecules to measure elastic properties . For in - stance , one can study the “equation of state” of a semi - ﬂexible polymer by measuring its extension [ 3 ] as a func - tion of applied force . Alternatively one can tag the ends with ﬂuorescent dye [ 4 ] and determine the distribution of end - to - end distances . Such studies reveal a wealth of information about the mechanical properties of semi - ﬂexible polymers , which is of clear biological importance . Till a few years ago , studies of polymer molecules such as DNA were limited to samples containing large num - bers of molecules [ 5 ] . This made it hard to probe the elastic properties of individual DNA which are of vi - tal importance to biological processes such as protein - induced DNA bending [ 2 , 6 ] . It is only quite recently , due to advances in technology that single molecule stud - ies became feasible . In order to correctly interpret single molecule experiments which are now being performed , a good theoretical understanding of semi - ﬂexible poly - mers is essential . Quite apart from the biological interest , semi - ﬂexible polymers are of interest to physicists [ 7 , 8 ] . This paper is devoted to understanding the equilibrium statistical mechanics of single semi - ﬂexible polymers . Statistical mechanics of a single polymer molecule is dominated by ﬂuctuations because it is a system of ﬁ - nite size . It is only in the thermodynamic limit of ex - tremely long polymers that these ﬂuctuations about the mean die out . Due to the dominance of ﬂuctuations , the experimentally measured mean values for a semi - ﬂexible polymer crucially depend on the precise choice of the en - semble . For instance , one gets qualitatively distinct fea - tures in force - extension curves depending on whether the force or the extension is held constant in an experimental setup [ 9 , 10 ] . The most popular theoretical model for understanding semi - ﬂexible polymers is the Worm - Like Chain ( WLC ) [ 11 ] , which ignores self - avoidance and models the poly - mer as a framed space curve of ﬁxed total length L with an energy cost for bending and twisting . In order to in - terpret the experimental data , it would be useful to have a clear and complete understanding of the predictions of the WLC model . Such an understanding would reveal the strengths and deﬁciencies of the model in describing real polymers and could be used to improve the model . There do exist partial results [ 12 ] on the statistical me - chanics of the WLC model : some theoretical studies [ 1 ] investigate the ﬂexible limit of very long polymers ( long compared to the persistence length ; L > > L p ) . However experimental interest is not conﬁned to very long poly - mers . For example , experiments on Actin [ 4 ] deal with polymers of length L = 30 µm , which is only about twice the measured persistence length of L p = 16 . 7 µm . There is also theoretical work [ 12 ] on extremely short polymers . There is a clear gap in the present understanding of the WLC model for polymers of intermediate length . Our purpose in this paper is to ﬁll this gap . We present a solution of the WLC model and describe the equilibrium elastic properties expected from the model . Our solution is exact in the sense that the elastic properties can be determined to any desired accuracy . The main results of this paper are contained in the ﬁgures which show the force - extension relation and end - to - end distance distri - butions predicted by the WLC model . These predictions agree well with two independent computer simulations [ 12 , 9 ] ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) . WLC model with pure bend : A conﬁguration C of the polymer is described by a space curve ~ x ( s ) , with s the arc - length parameter ( 0 ≤ s ≤ L ) ranging from 0 to L , the contour length of the polymer . The tangent vector ˆ t = d ~ x / ds to the curve is a unit vector ˆ t . ˆ t = 1 ( 1 ) and the curvature of the polymer is given by κ = | d ˆ t / ds | . We will suppose that one end of the polymer is tethered to the origin ( ~ x ( 0 ) = 0 ) and the other end ~ x ( L ) = ~ r is tagged . As the polymer conﬁguration changes with ther - mal agitation , the location ~ r of its tagged end ﬂuctuates . The quantity we wish to compute is Q ( ~ r ) , which is the probability distribution for the location ~ r of the tagged end [ 9 ] . If the tagged end is pulled from ~ r to ~ r + d ~ r , Q ( ~ r ) changes and consequently , the free energy . This implies 1 that a force is needed to stretch the polymer . Thus Q ( ~ r ) is directly related to the force - extension relation of the polymer . To compute Q ( ~ r ) we need to sum over all poly - mer conﬁgurations C which end at ~ r , with a Boltzmann weight : Z = Σ C exp ( −E [ C ] / k B T ) , where the energy E associated with a conﬁguration C is E ( C ) = 12 A R L 0 dsκ 2 and A is the bending modulus . This is a standard count - ing problem in statistical mechanics and can be natu - rally addressed in the language of path integration [ 13 ] . However , not much progress has been made because of the diﬃculty [ 14 , 15 ] presented by the inextensibility con - straint ( 1 ) . The key to circumventing this diﬃculty is to consider [ 1 , 16 ] Brownian motion in the space of tan - gent vectors ( ˆ t ) rather than ( as is customary for ﬂexible polymers ) position vectors ~ x . The tangent vectors form a unit sphere ( See Eq . ( 1 ) ) and the problem reduces to studying Brownian motion on the unit sphere , which can be handled by standard operator techniques familiar from quantum mechanics . Let us suppose to begin with that the initial ( ˆ t A = d ~ xds | s = 0 ) and ﬁnal ( ˆ t B = d ~ xds | s = L ) tangent vectors are held ﬁxed . Q ( ~ r ) has the path integral representation N Z D [ ˆ t ( s ) ] e − 1 / k B T [ A / 2 R L 0 ( d ˆ t / ds ) 2 ds ] δ 3 ( ~ r − Z L 0 ˆ tds ) ( 2 ) where N is a normalisation constant . Instead of Q ( ~ r ) we focus on the quantity P ( z ) = R d ~ rQ ( ~ r ) δ ( r 3 − z ) , which is Q ( ~ r ) integrated over a plane of constant z . Note that P ( z ) and Q ( ~ r ) vanish when the modulus of their argu - ments exceeds L . The generating function of P ( z ) is de - ﬁned as ˜ P ( f ) = R L − L dz e fz / L p P ( z ) , where L p = A / k B T . Performing the elementary integrations involving δ - func - tions we ﬁnd that ˜ P ( f ) can be expressed as Z ( f ) / Z ( 0 ) , where Z ( f ) has the path integral representation Z ( f ) = N Z D [ ˆ t ( s ) ] e − L p / 2 [ R L 0 ( d ˆ t / ds ) 2 ds ] e [ f / L p R L 0 ˆ t z ds ] ( 3 ) Making the change of variable τ = s / L p , we arrive at the expression Z ( f ) = N Z D [ ˆ t ( τ ) ] e − R β 0 dτ [ 1 / 2 ( d ˆ t / dτ ) 2 − f ˆ t z ] ( 4 ) where β = L / L p . Eq . ( 4 ) can be interpreted as the path integral representation for the kernel of a quantum par - ticle on the surface of a sphere at inverse temperature β . Thus we can express Z ( f ) as the quantum amplitude to go from an initial tangent vector ˆ t A to a ﬁnal tan - gent vector ˆ t B in imaginary time β in the presence of an external potential − f cos θ : Z ( f ) = X n e − [ βE n ] ψ ∗ n ( ˆ t A ) ψ n ( ˆ t B ) . ( 5 ) Here { ψ n ( ˆ t ) } , is a complete set of normalized eigenstates of the Hamiltonian ˆ H = − ∇ 2 2 − f cos θ and E n are the corresponding eigenvalues . In this paper we focus on the situation where the boundary tangent vectors are unconstrained , i . e they are integrated over with uniform weight . For free boundary conditions the situation is spherically symmetric and Q depends only on r = | r | and not on ~ r and we can write Q ( r ) . The probability distribution for the end to end distance r is given by S ( r ) = 4 πr 2 Q ( r ) , as can be seen by integrating Q ( ~ r ) over a sphere of radius r . As we did above , we can integrate Q ( ~ r ) over a plane of ﬁxed z : P ( z ) = R d ~ rQ ( ~ r ) δ ( r 3 − z ) . P ( z ) is the probability dis - tribution for the z co - ordinate of the tagged end . Both S ( r ) and P ( z ) are experimentally accessible quantities and they are integrals of the spherically symmetric func - tion Q ( ~ r ) over two dimensional surfaces . Using tomo - graphic techniques ( reconstruction of a function from a knowledge of its integral over two dimensional slices ) one can deduce [ 17 ] the relation S ( r ) = − 2 rdP ( r ) / dr , where P ( r ) is P ( z ) with its argument replaced by r . For free boundary conditions ( 5 ) can be written as a“vacuum persistence amplitude” Z ( f ) = < 0 | exp − βH f | 0 > ( 6 ) where H f = − 12 ∇ 2 − f cos θ is the Hamiltonian of the rigid rotor [ 1 ] in a potential and | 0 > is the ground state of the free Hamiltonian H 0 = − 12 ∇ 2 . 1 2 3 4 - 2 - 1 . 5 - 1 - 0 . 5 G ( f ) f FIG . 1 . G ( f ) as a function of f for β = L / L p = 1 . Also plotted are approximate analytic forms valid in the small ( open circles ) and large ( ﬁlled circles ) force regimes . By choosing a basis in which H 0 is diagonal we ﬁnd that H is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix with diagonal elements H l l = l ( l + 1 ) / 2 and superdiagonal elements H l l + 1 = f ( l + 1 ) p 1 / ( ( 2 l + 1 ) ( 2 l + 3 ) ) . Upto this point the treatment is completely analytical . To evaluate Eq . ( 6 ) we need to use numerical methods . H f is really an inﬁnite matrix , but we truncate it to NXN size , numer - ically evaluate it ( using Mathematica [ 18 ] ) and adjust 2 the cutoﬀ N until the answer stabilizes to desired accu - racy . From this we deduce all the properties of the model , to an accuracy limited only by computational power . The form of G ( f ) = − 1 / β log Z ( f ) is shown in Fig . 1 along with physically motivated approximate analytical forms valid in the small ( G ( f ) = C 1 ( β ) f 2 ) and large ( G ( f ) = − f + √ f − log f / ( 2 β ) + C 2 ( β ) ) force regimes . More terms can be computed , but this already gives a fair ﬁt . From ˜ P ( f ) ( which is equal to Z ( f ) since Z ( 0 ) = 1 ) , it is possible to compute P ( z ) by performing the inverse Laplace transform . ( Numerically it is more convenient to use the inverse Fourier transform by going to imag - inary f ) . The results are shown in Figure 2 . For con - venience , we set L p = 1 so that β = L and plot all ﬁgures in terms of scaled variables , ζ = z / β , ρ = r / β . 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 0 . 25 0 . 5 0 . 75 1 1 . 25 1 . 5 P ( ζ ) ζ β = 1 β = 3 . 85 β = 10 FIG . 2 .

The distribution S ( ρ ) of scaled end - to - end dis - tances ρ = r / β for β = L / L p equal to 1 , 3 . 85 and 10 . Dots show simulation data taken from Ref . [ 9 ] . From the relation S ( ρ ) = − 2 ρ ddρ P ( ρ ) we compute the distribution of end - to - end distance . These are displayed in Fig . 3 . We have checked that these graphs quan - titatively agree ( to within the errors of the simulation data ) with the published plots of [ 12 ] . Notice that P ( ζ ) and S ( ρ ) both have a single maximum and the corre - sponding free energies have a single minimum . How - ever , for a range of β near 3 . 8 , Q ( ρ ) develops a dou - ble humped form , reﬂecting the existence of two stable free energy minima resulting in a “ﬁrst order transition” , where the quotes signify that this is not a true phase transition due to ﬁnite size eﬀects . This feature was ﬁrst noticed [ 9 ] in computer simulations of the WLC model . Our theoretical work conﬁrms the results of simulations presented in [ 9 ] . The form of Q ( ρ ) is plotted in Fig . 4 along with the results of computer simulations from [ 9 ] . 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 Q ( ρ ) ρ β = 1 β = 3 . 85 β = 5 FIG . 4 .

[ 10 ] are also plotted on the curve for β = 3 . 85 . 2 4 6 8 10 - 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 ζ− f FIG . 5 . The mean extension ¯ ζ as a function of f ( thick line ) for β = L / L p = 10 . Also shown on either side are the root mean square ﬂuctuations ( thin lines ) of the extension about its mean value . A property of direct experimental interest is the force - extension relation ( FER ) . We work in the constant f en - semble and in Fig . 5 plot the scaled mean extension ζ ( f ) 3 ( deﬁned by ζ = − ∂G ( f ) / ∂f ) . Since we are dealing with a system of ﬁnite size , we expect that the extension ζ will ﬂuctuate about its mean value ζ . The theoretically expected root mean square value of these ﬂuctuations ∆ ζ = q 1 / β∂ζ / ∂f of ζ is shown in Fig . 5 . These ﬂuctuations clearly vanish in the limit of inﬁnitely long polymers [ 1 ] . Although the WLC model has been known for around ﬁfty years [ 11 ] , there does not appear to be a closed form analytic solution in terms of elementary functions . This paper presents a numerical solution to the WLC , which , given the power of modern personal computers is as use - ful as an exact analytic form . Using the techniques out - lined in this paper one could work out the predictions of the WLC model to any desired accuracy , for example , experimental accuracy . Our work provides predictions of force - extension curves for all lengths which can be tested against experiments . All the quantities computed here ( Q ( ρ ) , P ( ζ ) , S ( ρ ) , ˜ P ( f ) , G ( f ) and FER ) are experimen - tally measurable . Here we brieﬂy go over the pertinent experimental realizations of some of these quantities . ( a ) Measurement of Q ( ρ ) : One can measure Q ( ρ ) by attach - ing a bead to one end of the molecule and conﬁning the bead in a stiﬀ optical trap and by recording the distri - bution of location of the other end ( tagged with dye ) by means of a CCD camera . ( b ) Measurement of P ( ζ ) : P ( ζ ) can be measured by recording the location of the free end of the molecule on a given ζ plane and focussing all the light from the particular ζ plane by using a confocal mi - croscope . In this paper we have used free boundary conditions for the tangent vectors . Other boundary conditions can also be handled as explained in [ 19 ] . The boundary con - ditions depend on the particular experimental setup . For example , if the tangent vectors at the ends are held ﬁxed one needs to use δ function weights rather than uniform ones . Choice of theoretical weights consistent with ex - perimental boundary conditions is particularly crucial in the context of short polymers . The FERs predicted by the model depend on the en - semble in which the calculation is done . Depending on the experimental situation one should use an ensemble in which one of z , r , ~ r or their conjugate forces f , f r , ~ f is held constant . As an example we display in Fig . 5 the FER in the constant f ensemble . The force extension relations in this ensemble are monotonic for all values of β . ( In contrast , the FER in the constant ρ ensemble is non - monotonic [ 9 ] in the β range where the function Q ( ρ ) is double humped . ) As mentioned earlier , since we are dealing with a ﬁnite system , which is not near the thermodynamic limit , equivalence between conjugate en - sembles is not assured [ 10 ] . This is due to ﬂuctuations around mean values which are not negligible for short polymers . Our analysis , being exact , correctly takes into account such ﬁnite size eﬀects . The pure bend WLC model has a single parameter β = L / L p and predicts not only a force extension relation but also the amount of theoretically expected noise on this curve . In an experi - ment one can expect to see this noise over and above any instrumental noise that may be present in the system . Self - avoidance is a feature present in real polymers , which has not been taken into account in this analysis . Such eﬀects are more important for ﬂexible polymers . Self - avoidance is diﬃcult to handle analytically and is one of the important directions for future work . We hope that the results of this paper will stimulate a detailed and quantitative comparison between the predictions of the WLC model and experiments , and lead to an improved understanding of the elasticity of semi - ﬂexible polymers .
