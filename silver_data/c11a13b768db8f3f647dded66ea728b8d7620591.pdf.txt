RESEARCH ARTICLE SUMMARY ◥ CELL BIOLOGY Abl and Canoe / Afadin mediate mechanotransduction at tricellular junctions Huapeng H . Yu and Jennifer A . Zallen * INTRODUCTION : The ability to sense and re - spond to mechanical force is an intrinsic prop - erty of cells that is critical for normal cell function and often deregulated in disease . Mechanical forces induce changes in protein conformation , localization , activity , and post - translational modification in vitro . An out - standing question is how mechanical signals modulate protein function and cell behavior in response to the physiological forces en - counteredbycellsinlivingorganisms . Tyrosine phosphorylation has long been recognized to be enriched at adherens junctions , which detect and transmit forces between epithe - lial cells , and can be directly enhanced by mechanical forces in vitro . However , whether mechanical forces influence tyrosine kinase signaling in vivo , and the consequences of this regulation for cell behavior , are not known . RATIONALE : An important step in the devel - opment of epithelial organs is the remodeling of cell adhesion in response to mechanical forces , which transforms epithelial sheets into diverse structures . Tricellular junctions ( TCJs ) where three cells meet are dynamical - ly assembled and disassembled during cell rearrangement and are predicted to be sites of increased tension during epithelial remod - eling , providing an opportunity to investigate how cells respondto mechanical forces . How - ever , the mechanisms that allow tricellular junctions to rapidly remodel under tension without disrupting epithelial continuity are not well understood . Identifying and char - acterizing proteins that localize to tricellular junctions under tension can provide insight into the mechanotransduction pathways that modulate cell adhesion in response to mech - anical forces in vivo . RESULTS : Using time - lapse imaging and a method to directly visualize tyrosine phospho - rylation in living embryos , we found that tyro - sine phosphorylation is increased at tricellular junctions in a tension - dependent fashion during Drosophila convergent extension . By screening a library of tagged proteins , we identified Canoe as a tyrosine - phosphorylated protein that local - izes to tricellular junctions under tension . Canoe recruitment to tricellular junctions dynami - cally correlated with changes in myosin local - ization , and Canoe rapidly dissociated from tricellular junctions when tension was released by laser ablation . The enrichment of Canoe at tricellular junctions required Abl - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Canoe at Y1987 , a conserved site in the Canoe actin - binding do - main . Decreasing Abl expression or mutating this tyrosine to an unphosphorylatable amino acid significantly reduced Canoe enrichment at tricellular junctions and disrupted tricel - lular adhesion in vivo . To determine whether the dynamic recruitment of Canoe to tricellu - lar junctions is important for cell rearrange - ment , we developed a “ vertex trap ” method to constitutively target Venus - tagged Canoe to tricellular junctions independently of me - chanical inputs . Stably anchoring Canoe at tricellular junctions aberrantly stabilized ad - hesion at four - way vertices and arrested cell rearrangement . These results suggest that Canoelevelsdynamicallymodulatethestrengthofcelladhesionattricellularjunctionstofa - cilitate cell rearrangement . CONCLUSION : These results identify a mech - anotransduction pathway that dynamically couples tricellular adhesion with mechanical forces during epithelial remodeling . Canoe recruitment to tricellular junctions requires actomyosin contractility and Abl - dependent phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine in the Canoe actin - binding domain . Loss of Canoe disrupts tricellular adhesion , and increasing Canoe levels at tricellular junctions slows or arrests cell rearrangement , influencing the rate of epithelial remodeling . In one model , Canoe could act as a mechanosensor , physically stretching under tension to expose a phos - phorylation site for Abl . Alternatively , ten - sion could enhance Abl activity or generate a unique configuration of actin or other mol - ecules at tricellular junctions that is recog - nized by Canoe . Tricellular junctions influence many processes required for epithelial devel - opment and homeostasis , including cell rear - rangement , cell division , stem cell self - renewal , and barrier function . A better understanding ofthecomposition , organization , and dynamic properties of tricellular junctions will provide insight into how these structures sense and integrate mechanical forces in epithelia . ▪ RESEARCH Yu et al . , Science 370 , 1060 ( 2020 ) 27 November 2020 1 of 1 The list of author affiliations is available in the full article online . * Corresponding author .

RESEARCH ARTICLE ◥ CELL BIOLOGY Abl and Canoe / Afadin mediate mechanotransduction at tricellular junctions Huapeng H . Yu and Jennifer A . Zallen * Epithelial structure is generated by the dynamic reorganization of cells in response to mechanical forces . Adherens junctions transmit forces between cells , but how cells sense and respond to these forces in vivo is not well understood . We identify a mechanotransduction pathway involving the Abl tyrosine kinase and Canoe / Afadin that stabilizes cell adhesion under tension at tricellular junctions in the Drosophila embryo . Canoe is recruited to tricellular junctions in response to actomyosin contractility , and this mechanosensitivity requires Abl - dependent phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine in the Canoe actin - binding domain . Preventing Canoe tyrosine phosphorylation destabilizes tricellular adhesion , and anchoring Canoe at tricellular junctions independently of mechanical inputs aberrantly stabilizes adhesion , arresting cell rearrangement . These results identify a force - responsive mechanism that stabilizes tricellular adhesion under tension during epithelial remodeling . A universal property of cells is the ability to detect and respond to mechanical stimuli such as the stiffness of the extra - cellular environment , shear and osmotic stress from fluid flow , and forces gene - rated by neighboring cells ( 1 , 2 ) . Mechanical forces influence cell fate , division , adhesion , and behavior ( 3 , 4 ) , and defects in cellular mechanotransduction pathways are implicated in many diseases , including deafness , athero - sclerosis , and cancer ( 5 , 6 ) . In epithelial tis - sues , adherens junctions are critical sites of force transmission between cells ( 7 – 9 ) and undergo dynamic assembly and disassembly undertensionduringcellrearrangement ( 3 , 4 , 7 ) . Interactions between several components of adherens junction complexes are stabilized by mechanical forces in vitro and in cultured cells and have been proposed to reinforce cell adhesion under tension ( 10 – 15 ) . How - ever , how adherens junctions sense and re - spond to mechanical forces in vivo , and how these processes influence dynamic cell behav - iors in tissues , are not well understood . Me - chanical forces are converted into biochemical changes in cells through a variety of mecha - nisms , including changesinproteinconforma - tion , localization , activity , interactions , and posttranslational modifications ( 1 , 2 , 9 ) . In par - ticular , tyrosine phosphorylation is enhanced at cell - cell and cell - matrix adhesions , two es - sential force - bearing structures within cells ( 16 , 17 ) . Tyrosine phosphorylation can be mod - ulated by mechanical force in vitro , with evi - dence for force sensing at the level of tyrosine kinases ( 18 – 22 ) and substrates ( 22 – 25 ) . How - ever , whether tyrosine kinase signaling is reg - ulated by mechanical forces in vivo , and the effects of this regulation on cell adhesion and epithelial remodeling , are not well understood . Tyrosine phosphorylation at tricellular junctions is tension sensitive To investigate whether tyrosine kinase signal - ing is regulated by mechanical forces in vivo , we analyzed the distribution of tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins in the Drosophila embryo . During convergent extension , epithe - lialcellsundergodirectionalcellrearrangementsinresponsetoplanarpolarizedactomyosincontractility ( 26 – 30 ) . We observed a tissue - wide pattern of phosphotyrosine during this process , with the highest levels of tyrosine phos - phorylation at tricellular adherens junctions where three cells meet ( Fig . 1A and fig . S1A ) . Tricellular adherens junctions are specialized structures that contain dedicated adhesion molecules ( 31 – 34 ) and are predicted to be sites of increased tension in epithelia ( 35 – 37 ) . Phos - photyrosine was more strongly enriched at tricellular junctions than the core adherens junction proteins E - cadherin and a - catenin or the membrane marker Spider - GFP ( Fig . 1 , B and G ; fig . S1 , H and I ; and table S1 ) . The enrichment of phosphotyrosine was further increased at four - way junctions that form as intermediates during cell rearrangement ( fig . S1 , BandC ) . Theseresults indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation is enhanced at sites where three or more cells meet . To investigate the dynamics of tyrosine ki - nase signaling at tricellular junctions , we developed a method to visualize tyrosine phosphorylation in living embryos . Fluorophore - conjugated monoclonal antibodies to phos - photyrosinewereinjectedintosyncytialembryos and retained in cells after cellularization , allowing direct visualization of tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins ( Fig . 1 , C to E , and movie S1 ) . Phosphotyrosine levels at tricellu - lar junctions were positively correlated with myosin II regulatory light chain fused to the green fluorescent protein ( MRLC - GFP ) , an in - dicator of cortical contractility ( Fig . 1 , D and I , and fig . S1E ) . Inhibiting myosin activity by njectingtheRho - kinaseinhibitorY - 27632 ( 27 , 30 ) rapidly depleted phosphotyrosine levels at tri - cellular junctions within 5 min of injection , ac - companied by an increase in phosphotyrosine levels at bicellular junctions ( Fig . 1 , F and H , and fig . S1 , FandG ) . Theacutereleaseoftension by Y - 27632 did not affect the overall level of tyrosinephosphorylationintheembryo ( fig . S1D ) , adherens junction integrity ( fig . S1 , H to K ) , or the integrity of tricellular junctions marked by the tricellular adherens junction protein Sidekick ( 31 – 34 ) ( fig . S1 , L to O ) , which is sen - sitive to actomyosin perturbations over longer time scales ( 32 ) . These results demonstrate that increased tyrosine phosphorylation at tricellu - lar junctions requires cytoskeletal tension . Canoe / Afadin is a tyrosine kinase substrate at tricellular junctions To investigate the molecular basis of tension - sensitive tyrosine phosphorylation at tricellu - lar junctions , we screened > 100 Venus - tagged proteins ( 31 ) to identify factors that colocalize with phosphotyrosine at tricellular junctions . This screen identified Canoe / Afadin , a con - served actin - binding protein that links cell surface receptors to the actomyosin cytoskel - eton in Drosophila and mammals ( 38 – 43 ) . A functional Canoe - Venus fusion expressed from the endogenous locus ( 31 ) was enriched at tri - cellular junctions in wild - type ( WT ) embryos ( Fig . 1G ) , consistent with previous findings ( 40 , 42 ) . Canoe - Venus localization at tricellu - lar junctions was highly dynamic , accumulat - ing and dissipating on a time scale of seconds ( movie S2 ) , and these changes were strongly correlated with changes in phosphotyrosine ( Fig . 1 , J to L , and fig . S2 , A to C ) . Canoe - Venus was tyrosine phosphorylated in embryonic ly - sates , although Canoe protein accounted for only a minority of tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins in the embryo ( fig . S2 , D , I , and J ) . Moreover , phosphotyrosine levels at tricel - lular junctions were significantly reduced in canoe R2 maternal mutants ( referred to as canoe mutants ) and these levels were restored by reintroducing wild - type N - terminally tagged Canoe protein ( fig . S2 , E to H ) . These results indicate that Canoe , or a Canoe - dependent pro - tein , is a substrate for tyrosine kinase signal - ing at tricellular junctions . Canoe / Afadin is a critical regulator of epi - thelial morphogenesis and animal viability in Drosophila and mammals ( 38 – 41 ) . However , although mammalian Afadin can influence tricellular adhesion under certain conditions in culture ( 42 ) , an in vivo requirement for Canoe / Afadin in regulating tricellular adhesion RESEARCH Yu et al . , Science 370 , eaba5528 ( 2020 ) 27 November 2020 1 of 7 Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Developmental Biology Program , Sloan Kettering Institute , New York , NY , USA . * Corresponding author . Email : zallenj @ mskcc . org has not been directly demonstrated . To address this , weanalyzedcelladhesioninCanoe - deficient embryos using E - cadherin and Sidekick - Venus to visualize bicellular and tricellular junctions , respectively . In WT embryos , cells were in close contact at tricellular junctions and Sidekick - Venus localization in all three cells appeared as a single spot by confocal microscopy , indi - cating strong adhesion ( Fig . 2A ) . By contrast , gaps in E - cadherin and Sidekick - Venus local - ization at tricellular junctions were detected in canoe mutants and canoe knockdown ( KD ) embryos that express a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) targeting canoe ( Fig . 2 , A , I , and K , and fig . S3 , A to C ) . Defects in E - cadherin lo - calization at tricellular junctions were first de - tected in stage 7 in Canoe - deficient embryos , when E - cadherin localization at bicellular junctions was largely intact . By contrast , de - fects in E - cadherin localization at bicellular junctions were not prevalent until stage 8 ( fig . S3 , Dto F ) . Theseresultsdemonstrateanearly , specific requirement for Canoe in regulating cell adhesion at tricellular junctions . Abl - dependent phosphorylation of Canoe is required for tricellular adhesion The correlation between Canoe and phospho - tyrosine localization at tricellular junctions , and the requirement for Canoe in maintain - ing tricellular adhesion , raise the possibility that Canoe is part of a tyrosine kinase signal - ing pathway that stabilizes cell adhesion at tricellular junctions . Consistent with this idea , injection of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor bosutinibrapidlydecreasedCanoelocalization at tricellular junctions ( fig . S4 , A to G ) and disrupted tricellular adhesion ( fig . S4 , H to J ) . Abl , a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is in - hibited by bosutinib in mammals ( 44 ) , has conserved functions in epithelial remodeling and phosphorylates a large number of sub - strates involved in actin organization , cell ad - hesion dynamics , and cell matrix attachment ( 45 – 49 ) . We therefore tested whether Abl is required for Canoe localization and function at tricellular junctions using a maternally expressed shRNA that effectively inhibits Abl expression and activity ( 48 , 49 ) . We found that Abl KD embryos displayed a significantly re - duced enrichment of Canoe and phospho - tyrosine at tricellular junctions ( Fig . 2 , B and C , and fig . S5 , A to E ) , as well as defects in tricellular adhesion that were similar to , but not quite as severe as , the defects in Canoe - deficient embryos ( Fig . 2 , I to K ) . These results demonstrate that Abl is required for Canoe localization and cell adhesion at tricellular junctions . Because Abl is a tyrosine kinase , we hy - pothesized that it could regulate Canoe local - ization and function by promoting Canoe tyrosine phosphorylation . In support of this model , Abl enhanced Canoe tyrosine phos - phorylation when coexpressed with Canoe in Drosophila S2R + cells ( fig . S6 , A and B ) .

RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE contains 47 tyrosines , making identifying the Abl target sites in Canoe a daunting task . To expedite this process , we performed a structure - function analysis to identify the minimal sequences required for Canoe function . A trun - cated protein that contains the N - and C - terminal domains of Canoe ( Canoe - NC ) , but lacks the central region including the PDZ domain that interacts with several cell - surface receptors ( 39 ) , localized correctly to tricellular junctions ( fig . S7 , A and D ) and fully rescued myosin localization in canoe mutants ( fig . S7 , E and F ) , a well - established readout for Canoe function ( 40 , 41 ) . By contrast , further deletion of the N - terminal domain of Canoe that binds to the Rap1 guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase ) ( 43 , 50 ) or the C - terminal domain that binds to F - actin ( 38 , 40 ) eliminated Canoe localization to tricellular junctions and rendered Canoe nonfunctional ( fig . S7 , A and D to F ) . More - over , tyrosine phosphorylation of Canoe - NC , but not the full - length protein , was signifi - cantly reduced in Abl KD embryos ( fig . S6C ) . Therefore , even though other tyrosine kinases can phosphorylate the nonessential Canoe cen - tral domain , Abl is required for the phospho - rylation of the minimal Canoe - NC protein that is fully functional during convergent exten - sion .

RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE Abl - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the Canoe - NC protein in S2R + cells was sig - nificantlyreduced bymutating the11 C - terminal tyrosines ( Canoe - NC 11YF ) , the last four tyrosines ( Canoe - NC 4YF ) , or the most C - terminal tyro - sine of Canoe ( Canoe - NC Y1987F ) , which is located in a predicted Abl target site ( L / I / V - Y - x - x - P ) ( 46 ) ( Fig . 2 , F and G , and fig . S6 , A to C ) . These findings indicate that Abl promotes the phos - phorylation of the C - terminal tyrosine of Canoe , which is conserved from worms to mammals . To determine whether tyrosine phosphoryl - ation is required for Canoe function , we tested whether full - length Canoe phosphovariants rescue the defects in canoe mutant embryos . Both WT Canoe and a full - length Canoe var - iantlackingtheN - terminaltyrosines ( Canoe 9YF ) localized correctly to tricellular junctions ( fig . S7 , A to D ) and fully rescued tricellular ad - hesion in canoe mutants ( Fig . 2K ) . By contrast , full - length Canoe proteins lacking the 11 C - terminal tyrosines ( Canoe 11YF ) or the most C - terminal tyrosine ( Canoe Y1987F ) were less enriched at tricellular junctions and failed to rescue tricellular adhesion and myosin localization in canoe mutants ( Fig . 2 , D , E , H , and K , and fig . S7 , A and D to F ) . Canoe Y1987F embryos had more severe defects in tricellular adhesion than did Abl KD embryos ( Fig . 2 , J and K ) , likely because of residual Abl expres - sion or the ability of other kinases to phos - phorylate the Canoe C - terminal domain . All Canoe phosphovariants localized correctly to bicellular junctions ( fig . S7 , A and B ) , indicat - ing that a general localization to adherens junctions in the absence of a selective enrich - ment at tricellular junctions is not sufficient for Canoe function . These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of the most C - terminal tyrosine of Canoe is necessary for its localiza - tion and function in vivo . Canoe localization to tricellular junctions is mechanosensitive Because Canoe is dynamically recruited to and stabilizes adhesion at tricellular junctions , we hypothesized that it could be part of a force - regulated mechanism that strengthens adhe - sion at tricellular junctions under tension . To test this model , we used three approaches to determine whether Canoe localization is regu - lated by force . First , we analyzed the relation - ship between Canoe and myosin localization at tricellular junctions in living embryos . Canoe - Venus localization to tricellular junc - tions was pulsatile ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) , a char - acteristic feature of contractile actomyosin networks ( 51 , 52 ) . Moreover , Canoe recruit - ment to tricellular junctions was strongly cor - related with changes in myosin localization , with no delaybetween Canoe - Venus and MRLC - mCherry recruitment by cross - correlation analy - sis ( Fig . 3C and movie S3 ) . Consistent with this relationship , the enrichment of Canoe at tri - cellular junctions was significantly reduced in stage 15 embryos that have less cortical myosin ( fig . S8 , A to C ) . By contrast , less Canoe protein was recruited with each myosin pulse in Abl KD embryos , even though myosin lo - calization and dynamics at tricellular junc - tions occurred normally ( fig . S5 , H to N , and movie S4 ) . Thus , Canoe recruitment corre - lates with bursts of myosin accumulation at tricellular junctions in WT embryos , and Canoe localization appears to be uncoupled from my - osin in the absence of Abl activity . To further investigate this model , we tested whetherCanoelocalizationtotricellularjunctions Yu et al . , Science 370 , eaba5528 ( 2020 ) 27 November 2020 4 of 7 Fig . 3 .

Embryos are stage 7 . Living embryos expressing endogenous Canoe - Venus are shown in all panels . Anterior is left ; ventral is down . Scale bars , 10 m m . RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE requires actomyosin activity . Reducing acto - myosin contractility by injecting a Rho - kinase inhibitor resulted in a rapid loss of Canoe - Venus from tricellular junctions within 5 min of injection and suppressed fluctuations in Canoe - Venus intensity ( Fig . 3 , D and E ; fig . S8 , D to F ; and movie S5 ) . By contrast , Rho - kinase inhibitor did not decrease , and in fact slightly increased , Canoe - Venus levels at bicellular junctions ( Fig . 3D and fig . S8 , G , I , and J ) . These results indicate that actomyosin con - tractility is not necessary for Canoe cortical localization but is required for the selective accumulation of Canoe at tricellular junctions . To directly test whether Canoe localization is regulated by mechanical force , we used laser ablation methods ( 30 , 35 ) to acutely release tension at individual tricellular junctions by severing one of the three connected bicellular junctions ( Fig . 3 , F and G , and movie S6 ) . To quantify the effects of releasing tension , we measured Canoe - Venus intensity at the tri - cellular junctions and bicellular junctions attached to the cut edge before and after ablation . To control for photobleaching , we analyzed Canoe - Venus intensity in cells lo - catedtwo or morecells away fromthe ablation site for comparison ( fig . S8H ) . Laser ablation led to a 23 ± 9 % ( mean ± SD ) decrease in Canoe - Venus intensity at tricellular junctions within 70 s after ablation , whereas Canoe - Venus localization at bicellular junctions was unaffected ( Fig . 3 , H and I ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that Canoe - Venus enrichment at tricellular junctions requires mechanical forces generated by actomyosin contractility . Dynamic Canoe localization to tricellular junctions is required for cell intercalation The findings that Canoe is recruited to tricel - lular junctions by tyrosine phosphorylation and actomyosin contractility raise two ques - tions . First , what is the physiological relevance of coupling Canoe recruitment with changes in myosin activity ? Second , does tyrosine phos - phorylation only regulate Canoe localization to tricellular junctions , or is it also required for Canoefunctionatthese sites ? To addressthese questions , we developed a method to target Canoeto tricellular junctionsindependentlyof endogenous mechanical inputs . This “ vertex trap ” method involved expressing VhhGFP4 ( VHH ) , a genetically encoded nanobody with high affinity for GFP ( 53 ) , fused to the C ter - minus of the tricellular junction protein Side - kick ( Sdk ) ( 32 – 34 ) . Sdk - VHH expression is predicted to recruit GFP - and Venus - tagged proteins to tricellular junctions through inter - actions with the localized nanobody ( Fig . 4B ) . The localization of Canoe - Venus was not sig - nificantly altered by Sdk - VHH expression in WT embryos ( Fig . 4 , A and E ) , and cell adhe - sion and myosin localization in these embryos occurred normally ( fig . S9 , A to E ) . By contrast , Sdk - VHH allowed Canoe - Venus to remain as - sociated with tricellular junctions when myosin activity was inhibited by Y - 27632 injection , a situation in which this enrichment is nor - mally lost in WT embryos ( Fig . 4 , A and F ) . Thus , the vertex trap system uncouples Canoe localization from cytoskeletal tension , provid - ing an opportunity to investigate the effects of eliminating Canoe mechanosensitivity on cell rearrangement . To investigate the effects of uncoupling Canoe localization from mechanical inputs , we performed time - lapse imaging of embryos expressing vertex - trapped Canoe . During con - vergent extension , epithelial cells undergo cell rearrangements that are driven by planar po - larized actomyosin contractility ( 26 – 30 ) . In a stereotypical cell rearrangement during this process ( 27 ) , tricellular junctions merge to form four - way vertices that subsequently resolve to form twonewtricellularjunctions , aprocessthat requires active remodeling of cell adhesion ( Fig . 4 , Cand I , and fig . S10A ) . Protein localization is highly dynamic during this process , with MRLC - mCherry and Canoe - Venus reproduci - bly dissociating from four - way vertices just before resolution ( Fig . 4C and fig . S10 , B and C ) . In embryos that express vertex - trapped Canoe , cells were frequently arrested at the four - way vertex stage , resulting in an increase in the average vertex duration time to 9 . 1 ± 0 . 7 min compared with 5 . 1 ± 0 . 4 min in WT embryos ( mean±SEM ) ( Fig . 4 , D , G , andI , andmovieS7 ) . Embryos that expressed vertex - trapped Canoe also often failed to complete resolution and displayed increased cell stretching , consistent with a reduction in cell rearrangement ( fig . S9 , F and G ) . Further increasing the levels of Canoe at tricellular junctions by coexpressing Sdk - VHH with overexpressed Canoe extended the vertex duration time to 17 . 8 ± 0 . 9 min , more thanthreetimeslongerthaninWTembryos ( Fig . 4H and movie S8 ) . By contrast , Abl KD embryos that recruited less Canoe to tricellular junctions accelerated vertex resolution , reducing the aver - age vertex duration time to 2 . 6 ± 0 . 2 min ( fig . S10 , D and E ) ( 48 ) . It was not possible to an - alyze vertex duration in Canoe - deficient em - bryos because of the widespread defects in tricellular adhesion . These results indicate that varying Canoe levels at tricellular junctions modulates the timing of cell rearrangement . We next tested whether tyrosine phosphoryl - ation is solely required for Canoe localization to tricellular junctions , or if it is also necessary for Canoe function at these sites . If tyrosine phosphorylation is only required to recruit Canoe to tricellular junctions , then trapping Canoe phosphovariants at these sites would be predicted to bypass the requirement for phosphorylation . Using the vertex trap assay , we found that Canoe 11YF - Venus , which lacks the 11 C - terminal tyrosines of Canoe including Y1987 , stabilizedcelladhesionatfour - cellvertices and delayed cell rearrangement to the same extent as WT Canoe ( Fig . 4H and movie S9 ) . By contrast , deleting the entire C - terminal re - gion of Canoe ( Canoe - D C ) , including the F - actin – binding domain , eliminated the effects of vertex - trapped Canoe on cell adhesion ( Fig . 4H and fig . S9 , H and I ) . Thus , tyrosine phos - phorylation is essential for Canoe localiza - tion to tricellular junctions but is not required for Canoe to stabilize adhesion at these sites when Canoe is targeted to tricellular junctions through a heterologous mechanism . Together , these results demonstrate that tyrosine phos - phorylation modulates Canoe levels at tricel - lular junctions , which influences the rate of cell rearrangement during epithelial remodeling . Discussion Here , we show that Canoe and Abl function in a mechanotransduction pathway that regu - lates dynamic changes in cell adhesion at tri - cellular junctions during epithelial remodeling . Canoe localization to tricellular junctions is acutely disrupted by laser ablation , demonstrat - ingthat Canoelocalizationisrapidlymodulated bymechanicalperturbation . Canoemechanosen - sitivity requires Abl - dependent phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine ( Y1987 ) in the Canoe actin - binding domain , and Canoe localization to tricellular junctions is required to stabilize tricellular adhesion . Conversely , constitutively anchoring Canoe at tricellular junctions ar - rests cell rearrangement , indicating that Canoe levels can tune the rate of junctional remodel - ing ( Fig . 4J ) . These results demonstrate that the mechanosensitivity of this critical junc - tional regulator is modulated by phosphoryl - ation of a single tyrosine residue and reveal an essential role of Canoe in coupling tricellular adhesion with mechanical forces during epi - thelial remodeling . Mechanical forces trigger a cascade of mo - lecular events in cells that translate biophysical signals into altered cellular behaviors . How - ever , the mechanosensors that directly change conformation under tension in vivo are not well defined . Cell surface receptors are well positionedtodetectforcesgeneratedbyneigh - boring cells , but Canoe localization and func - tion at tricellular junctions do not require the PDZ domain that mediates its interac - tion with known receptors ( 39 ) . One possi - bility is that the Canoe protein itself could act as a mechanosensor . Canoe is predicted to be anchored to the membrane through in - teractions with Rap1 and the actin cytoskel - eton ( 38 – 40 , 43 , 50 ) . Thus , cytoskeletal tension could stretch the Canoe protein and expose tyrosine 1987 to phosphorylation by Abl . Al - ternatively , Abl or its upstream activators could be regulated by tension during this process , because the activity of Abl and other tyrosine kinases such as Src and FAK has been shown Yu et al . , Science 370 , eaba5528 ( 2020 ) 27 November 2020 5 of 7 RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE to be regulated by tension in vitro ( 18 – 22 ) . In a third possibility , the regulation of Canoe by Abl could allow Canoe to detect force - induced changes in other molecules at tricellular junc - tions . Becausetyrosine1987isintheCanoeactin - binding domain , phosphorylation at this site could allow Canoe to recognize distinct actin structures at tricellular junctions , force - induced conformational changes in the cadherin - catenin complex ( 54 , 55 ) , or other specialized features of tricellular junction composition or geome - try ( 37 ) . Once recruited to tricellular junctions , Canoe could stabilize adhesion at these sites by reinforcing the connection between adherens junctions and the actomyosin cytoskeleton ( 40 – 42 ) . Abl tyrosine kinases influence many struc - tural changes that are driven by mechanical forces in tissues , including epithelial remod - eling , tissue invagination , axon guidance , and cell migration ( 45 , 46 ) . Abl has been shown to regulate a number of proteins that act at tension - bearing structures in cells in addi - tion to Canoe / Afadin recruitment to tricel - lular junctions , including vinculin localization ( 20 , 22 , 25 ) and b - catenin recycling ( 48 ) at bicellular junctions and regulation of mem - brane curvature by BAR - domain proteins ( 21 ) . Together , these results raise the possibility that Abl could transduce mechanical forces into a wide range of structural changes within cells . For example , during cell rearrangement , Abl could simultaneously stabilize tricellular adhesion by recruiting Canoe and destabilize bicellular adhesion by enhancing b - catenin turnover ( 48 ) , which could allow bicellular junc - tions to complete contraction before tricellular junctions are remodeled . Tricellular junctions serve many important roles in epithelial devel - opment and homeostasis , including modulating cell rearrangement ( 32 – 34 , 52 ) , orienting mitotic spindles ( 56 ) , balancing stem cell proliferation and differentiation ( 57 ) , and maintaining epi - thelial barrier function ( 58 ) . An understanding of how mechanical inputs affect the confor - mation , localization , activity , and interactions of proteins at tricellular junctions will provide insight into how these structures sense and integrate mechanical forces in epithelial tissues .
