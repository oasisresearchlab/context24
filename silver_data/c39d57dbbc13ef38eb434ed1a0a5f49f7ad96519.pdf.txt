Interaction between amyloid proteins and extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) , which are secreted by various cells , is known to promote the clearance of the proteins , but it is unclear whether EVs are involved in the formation and deposition of TTR amyloid in ATTRv amyloidosis . To clarify the relationship between ATTRv amyloidosis and EVs , serum - derived EVs were analyzed . In this study , we showed that cell - derived EVs are involved in the formation of TTR amyloid deposits on the membrane of small EVs , as well as the deposition of TTR amyloid in cells . Human serum - derived small EVs also altered the degree of aggregation and deposition of TTR . Furthermore , the amount of TTR aggregates in serum - derived small EVs in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis was lower than that in healthy controls . These results indicate that EVs contribute to the metabolism of TTR amyloid , and suggest that TTR in serum - derived small EVs is a potential target for future ATTRv amyloidosis diagnosis and therapy . Keywords : amyloidosis , transthyretin , extracellular vesicle , ATTRv amyloidosis , atomic force microscope INTRODUCTION Amyloidosis refers to a group of diseases in which insoluble proteins , called amyloids , are deposited in various organs , causing functional impairment ( Picken , 2020 ) . Amyloid is formed by the misfolding and aggregation of soluble proteins . Once formed , amyloid takes on a ﬁ brillar structure and is deposited outside the cell ( Sipe and Cohen , 2000 ; Picken , 2020 ) . The extracellular deposition of amyloid leads to destruction of normal tissue structure and cellular dysfunction ( Agostinho et al . , 2010 ; Merlini et al . , 2011 ) . Physical compression by amyloid deposition , oxidative stress , and abnormal mitochondrial function are thought to be the main mechanisms of cellular dysfunction ( Ando et al . , 1998 ; Buxbaum and Linke , 2012 ) . A variety of soluble proteins , including amyloid - β ( A β ) , α - synuclein ( α - syn ) , transthyretin ( TTR ) , β 2 - microglobulin ( β 2 - MG ) , and serum amyloid A ( SAA ) are aggregated and deposited in the body , Edited by : Chiara Porro , University of Foggia , Italy Reviewed by : Mauro Manno , National Research Council ( CNR ) , Italy Gefei Chen , Karolinska Institutet ( KI ) , Sweden * Correspondence : Hironori Kawahara kawahara @ med . kanazawa - u . ac . jp Rikinari Hanayama hanayama @ med . kanazawa - u . ac . jp Specialty section : This article was submitted to Cellular Biochemistry , a section of the journal Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences Received : 20 December 2021 Accepted : 22 February 2022 Published : 23 March 2022 Citation : Yamaguchi H , Kawahara H , Kodera N , Kumaki A , Tada Y , Tang Z , Sakai K , Ono K , Yamada M and Hanayama R ( 2022 ) ExtracellularVesiclesContribute to the Metabolism of Transthyretin Amyloid in Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis . Front . Mol . Biosci . 9 : 839917 . doi : 10 . 3389 / fmolb . 2022 . 839917 Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 839917 1 ORIGINAL RESEARCH published : 23 March 2022 doi : 10 . 3389 / fmolb . 2022 . 839917 causing amyloidosis ( Picken , 2020 ) . For example , A β and α - syn are predominantly deposited in the brain , A β aggregates are detected in patients with Alzheimer ’ s disease and are called senile plaques ( Hashimoto et al . , 2020 ) , and Lewy bodies , formed by the aggregation of α - syn , are deposited in the brains of patients with Parkinson ’ s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies ( Gomperts , 2016 ) . These are examples of localized amyloidosis , in which amyloid deposits are con ﬁ ned to the central nervous system . In systemic amyloidosis , such as reactive AA amyloidosis and hereditary ( variant ) transthyretin amyloidosis ( ATTRv amyloidosis ) , amyloid is deposited in multiple organs . Reactive AA amyloidosis , in which SAA is the amyloid precursor protein , is associated with secondary to chronic in ﬂ ammatory diseases and infections ( rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , tuberculosis , etc . ) . In hereditary ATTRv amyloidosis , TTR gene variant forms amyloid , which is deposited in multiple organs such as the peripheral nerves , gastrointestinal tract , heart , eyes , and kidneys ( Sekijima et al . , 2018 ) . TTR is mainly produced in the liver and exists as a tetramer in serum ; however , the dissociation of tetramers into a monomers is the rate - limiting step in amyloid formation ( Sekijima et al . , 2018 ) . TTR tetramers composed of variant TTR are more likely to dissociate into monomers than those composed of wild - type TTR ( Sekijima et al . , 2018 ; Yee et al . , 2019 ) . The most common variant in the causative TTR gene is the p . Val50Met ( Val30Met ; V30M ) variant , and the resulting mutated TTR is called V30M - TTR ( Yee et al . , 2019 ) . Acidic conditions also promote TTR amyloid formation in vitro ( Yee et al . , 2019 ) . Unlike A β , which is produced by neurons , TTR is not produced near the site of deposition of TTR aggregation or in the surrounding tissues . Furthermore , the mechanism of TTR aggregation and deposition in the body remains unknown . Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) are small membrane vesicles secreted by various cell and tissue types ( Kalluri and LeBleu , 2020 ) . EVs contain biological materials such as proteins , messenger RNA , and microRNA derived from the cells that produce them . Intercellular communication , such as the transport of pathogenic proteins , plays a major role in EVs , and the proteins and RNAs contained in EVs are useful biomarkers of several diseases ( Kalluri and LeBleu , 2020 ) . Notably , the addition of Schwann cell - derived EVs or mesenchymal stem cell - derived EVs to mouse models of diabetic neuropathy or mice that were physically subjected to peripheral neuropathy promoted nerve repair ( Dong et al . , 2019 ; Fan et al . , 2021 ) . In vitro , Neuro2a mouse neuroblastoma ( N2a ) cell - derived EVs ( N2a - EVs ) promote A β aggregation in EVs . In addition , A β aggregated on N2a - EVs is easily taken up by microglia and degraded ( Yuyama et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , continuous injection of N2a - EVs into mouse models of Alzheimer ’ s disease enhanced the phagocytosis of A β aggregates by microglia and reduced the amount of amyloid deposition in the brain ( Yuyama et al . , 2014 ) . Moreover , SAA and SAA oligomers present in plasma EVs also exhibit amyloid - enhancing - factor activity ( Tasaki et al . , 2010 ) . Human serum EVs ( S - EVs ) collected by ultracentrifugation contain TTR amyloid ( Tong et al . , 2017 ) ; however , it remains unknown whether EVs contribute to TTR aggregation , deposition , or clearance in hereditary ATTRv amyloidosis . In this study , we show that TTR aggregation is enhanced on EV membranes and that EVs promote cell deposition accompanied by TTR aggregation , even under non - acidic conditions . Furthermore , we observe a decrease in TTR in serum - derived EVs in patients with hereditary ATTRv amyloidosis , indicating that EVs could play an active role in TTR tissue deposition . MATERIALS AND METHODS Puri ﬁ cation of Serum Extracellular Vesicles Six patients with ATTRv ( V30M - TTR ) amyloidosis and six healthy controls provided serum samples in this study . The patients included three males and three females , whereas the healthy individuals were six males . The age of the patients was 56 – 75 , and that of the healthy controls was 22 – 40 . Serum was collected from patients after diagnosis and before the start of treatment for ATTRv amyloidosis . The duration of illness was 3 – 7 years at the time of blood sampling . All donors provided informed consent , and the study was approved by the Kanzawa University Ethics Committee Reference 2018 – 238 ( 3 , 029 ) . All serum samples were centrifuged at 3 , 000 ×g for 10 min and 10 , 000 × g for 30 min at 4 ° C , followed by micro ﬁ ltration with Millipore 0 . 22 μ m ﬁ lters . Filtrated serum ( 1 ml ) was reacted with MagCapture Exosome Isolation Kit PS ( MagCapture ) ( FUJIFILM Wako , Japan ) according to the manual . After the overnight reaction , puri ﬁ ed serum EVs were eluted with elution buffer and the EVs were saved ( FUJIFILM Wako ) . Eluted serum EVs were stored at 4 ° C until further use . The concentration of serum EVs was measured using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c , United States ) at 25 ° C . The number and size distribution of EV particles were measured via nanoparticle tracking analysis using a NanoSight LM10 instrument ( software NTA 3 . 1 ; Malvern Panalytical , United Kingdom ) after diluting the EVs 30 times with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . The particle numbers per frame used were 70 particles / frame for recording of S - EVs in Raw mode .

Absorbance spectra were obtained at 25 ° C using an Enspire Multimode plate reader ( PerkinElmer ) , and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm ( reference wavelength : 620 nm ) . According to the manual , the actual absorbance was obtained by subtracting the blank absorbance from the average absorbance at three points . Binding of EVs and Puri ﬁ ed TTR in Neutral Conditions and Extracellular Vesicles Labeling Each 30 μ l of puri ﬁ ed TTR in FCS - free DMEM ( WT - TTR or V30M - TTR , 0 . 4 mg / ml ) and cell line - derived EVs ( 40 μ g / ml ) were mixed in a PCR tube . The mixtures were incubated for 48 h at 37 ° C . Then , 15 μ L of each sample was used for western blotting analysis , and the remaining samples were diluted 100 times with reaction buffer and used for EV ELISA . The experiment was also conducted in serum EVs using the same procedure . For PKH - labeled EVs , 293T - EVs ( 3 μ g ) was incubated with 4x PKH26 Dye solution ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 15 min at room temperature according to the manual after both ultracentrifugation followed by MagCapture . PKH - labeled EVs was puri ﬁ ed by Exosome Spin Columns ( Thermo ) by centrifuging at 750 × g for 2 min . Immunocytochemistry Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously ( Kawahara et al . , 2008 ) . V30M - TTR in FCS - free DMEM was aggregated in acidic buffer for 3 days , and TTR aggregates were diluted in FCS - free DMEM ( ﬁ nal TTR concentration ; 1 . 0 μ g / ml ) . HEK293T cell was incubated with 10 % FCS - DMEM ( 500 μ l ) on gelatin coated 12 mm coverslips until they reached 50 % con ﬂ uence at 37 ° C . Then , the culture medium was replaced with fresh 2 % FCS - DMEM ( 500 μ l ) and 10 μ l of diluted aggregated TTR was added , and the cells were incubated at 37 ° C for 30 h . After incubation , the cells were washed with TBS - T and ﬁ xed with 4 % PFA for 15 min at room temperature . The cells were then washed , 2 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) was added to TBS - T , and cells were incubated with shaking for 30 min at room temperature .

The cells were washed with TBS - T , Streptavidin - Cy3 ( BioLegend , 405215 ) diluted 1 , 000 times with 2 % BSA in TBS - T , and incubated overnight at 4 ° C with shading . After incubation , the cells were washed with TBS - T and incubated with VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium with DAPI ( 5 μ g / ml ) ( VECTOR LABORATORIES , Unites states ) . Puri ﬁ ed V30M - TTR in FCS - free DMEM was also used . HEK293T cell was cultured as described above until they reached 90 % con ﬂ uence . The culture medium was then replaced with fresh 2 . 5 % FCS - DMEM ( 400 μ l ) . Puri ﬁ ed V30M - TTR in FCS - free DMEM ( 50 μ l , 2 . 0 mg / ml ) with 50 μ l of serum EVs ( 70 ng / ml ) or elution buffer ( MagCapture , FUJIFILM Wako , Japan ) were also spread on the cell lines , and cells were incubated at 37 ° C for 18 h . After incubation , the same procedure described above was performed to observe the ﬂ uorescence . For the uptake of 293T - EVs , HEK293T cell was cultured as described above until they reached 90 % con ﬂ uence . The culture medium was then replaced with fresh 2 . 5 % FCS - DMEM ( 400 μ l ) . Puri ﬁ ed TTR or V30M - TTR in FCS - free DMEM ( 50 μ l , 2 . 0 mg / ml ) with 50 μ l of PKH26 - labeled 293T - EVs ( 70 ng / ml ) or PKH26 - labeled 293T - EVs alone were also spread on the cell lines , and cells were incubated at 37 ° C for 24 h . After incubation , the same procedure described above was performed to observe the ﬂ uorescence using anti - aggregated TTR antibody , anti - mouse IgG , Biotin - linked antibody ( Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories , 715 - 065 - 150 ) , and Streptavidin - FITC ( BD Bioscience , 554060 ) . They were captured by BZ - X710 ( KEYENCE , Japan ) or FV10 - ASW ( Olympus ) and Quantitative analysis were performed using Hybrid Cell Count software according to the manual ( Keyenece , BZ - H3C ) . High - Speed Atomic Force Microscopy A laboratory - built high - speed atomic force microscope ( HS - AFM ) was used for the analysis , as described previously ( Ando et al . , 2013 ) . In brief , a glass sample stage ( diameter , 2 mm ; height , 2 mm ) with a thin mica disc ( 1 . 5 mm diameter and ~ 0 . 05 mm thickness ) glued to the top by epoxy was attached onto the top of a Z - scanner using a drop of nail polish . A drop ( 2 μ l ) of the serum EV solution from the healthy control group ( 1 . 8 × 10 9 particles / ml ) was deposited onto a freshly cleaved mica surface and left to sit for 3 min . This ensured that the S - EVs were nonspeci ﬁ cally immobilized on the mica surface . After rinsing the surface with either PBS buffer or acidic buffer ( pH 4 . 0 ) of 20 μ l , the sample stage was immersed in a liquid cell ﬁ lled with either PBS buffer or acidic buffer ( 60 μ l ) , and HS - AFM imaging was conducted in tapping mode . We used small cantilevers ( BL - AC10DS - A2 , Olympus , Tokyo ) with a spring constant , resonant frequency in water , and quality factor in water of ~ 0 . 1 N / m , ~ 0 . 5 MHz , and ~ 1 . 5 , respectively . The probe tip was grown on the original tip end of the cantilever through electron beam deposition using ferrocene . The cantilever ’ s free oscillation amplitude A 0 and set - point amplitude A s were set to ~ 2 nm and ~ 0 . 9 × A 0 , respectively . In some experiments , puri ﬁ ed V30M - TTR solution ( 5 μ L ) was injected into the observation buffer during HS - AFM imaging so that the ﬁ nal concentration of TTR was either 0 . 07 mg / ml or 0 . 25 mg / ml , as described previously ( Nonaka et al . , 2020 ) . Details of the HS - AFM imaging method are described elsewhere ( Uchihashi et al . , 2012 ) . Data analysis of HS - AFM images was performed as described previously ( Kori et al . , 2019 ; Kodera et al . , 2021 ) . Analysis of High - Speed Atomic Force Microscopy Images For analysis , HS - AFM images were pretreated with a low - pass ﬁ lter to remove spike noise and with a ﬂ atten ﬁ lter to render the overall xy - plane ﬂ at using a laboratory - built software , as described before ( Ngo et al . , 2015 ) .

Metabolism of TTR Amyloid by EVs measured semi - automatically using the following steps . First , the estimated highest point of a S - EV was selected manually . Second , the actual highest point was automatically determined by searching a 10 × 10 pixel area ( typically 40 × 40 nm 2 ) around the selected point . 2D correlation coef ﬁ cients were calculated between the HS - AFM images of the ﬁ rst frame and each of the frames within the region of interest ( ROI ) ( i . e . , the ﬁ rst frame is the reference ) ( Kori et al . , 2019 ) . The ROIs were set as rectangles that enclosed the spherical - shaped S - EVs ( typically 50 × 50 nm 2 ) . The 2D correlation coef ﬁ cient was calculated frame - by - frame for each ROI . The 2D correlation coef ﬁ cient r is de ﬁ ned as , r (cid:1) (cid:1) m (cid:1) n (cid:3) H mn − (cid:1) H (cid:4)(cid:3) R mn − (cid:1) R (cid:4) (cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:1) m (cid:1) n (cid:3) H mn − (cid:1) H (cid:4) 2 (cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:1) m (cid:1) n (cid:3) R mn − (cid:1) R (cid:4) 2 (cid:7) (cid:8) in which H mn and R mn are the heights at the pixel points ( m , n ) in the ROI to be analyzed and the ROI of the reference , respectively . Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8 . 4 . 3 . Statistical comparisons were performed as indicated in the ﬁ gure legends . p values ≤ 0 . 05 were considered to be statistically signi ﬁ cant , and those not signi ﬁ cant ( n . s . ) were indicated accordingly . Bar graphs are presented as the mean ± standard error ( S . E . ) . Two - sample tests were performed by Mann – Whitney ’ s U - test . Multiple comparisons were performed via one - way analysis of variance . No statistical methods were used to select N number . RESULTS Extracellular Vesicles Bind to Transthyretin and Promote Transthyretin Aggregation The majority of TTR is produced as a secreted protein in the liver ( Sekijima et al . , 2018 ) ; the presence of serum EVs containing TTR has also been reported ( Tong et al . , 2017 ) . To con ﬁ rm whether HepG2 cells contained TTR , immunoblotting was performed using HepG2 culture supernatants . TTR was detected in HepG2 - EVs ( Figure 1A ) . In HEK293T and NIH3T3 cells that did not produce TTR , TTR was not detected in either the supernatants or EVs ( Figure 1B ) . The particle size and distribution of EVs were similar among the three groups FIGURE 1 | HepG2 - derived EVs contain TTR whereas HEK293T - derived EVs or NIH3T3 - derived EVs do not .

A β , which is a major causative factor of Alzheimer ’ s disease , binds to the surface proteins of Neuro2a cell - derived EVs and promotes A β aggregation on EVs ( Yuyama et al . , 2012 ) . To investigate whether TTR , a major causative factor of ATTR amyloidosis ( which is the same type of amyloidosis as Alzheimer ’ s disease ) , interacts with the EV membrane surface , we analyzed the interaction using puri ﬁ ed TTR and EVs derived from HEK293T and NIH3T3 cells that do not produce TTR . HEK293T cell - derived EVs ( HEK293T - EVs ) or NIN3T3 cell - derived EVs ( NIH3T3 - EVs ) were mixed with puri ﬁ ed wild - type TTR ( WT - TTR ) or V30M - TTR then analyzed . First , immunoblotting was performed using samples that had been mixed with EVs or non - EVs and puri ﬁ ed TTR or FCS - free DMEM , then allowed to stand at 37 ° C for 48 h . In the mixed sample of V30M - TTR and EVs , multiple bands were detected ( Figure 2A ) . This result suggests that mixing of V30M - TTR and EVs resulted in the aggregation of TTR ( Figure 2A ) . The mixed sample of NIH3T3 - EVs and WT - TTR also showed slight banding . Multiple bands were not observed in the sample without EVs ( Figure 2A ) . Next , to con ﬁ rm the co - localization of EVs with TTR aggregates , we performed EV ELISA using the same samples as for immunoblotting . An increase in absorbance was observed in the mixed samples of EVs and TTR , with the highest absorbance in the mixed samples of NIH3T3 - EVs and V30M - TTR ( Figures 2B , C ) . The absorbance exhibited a minimal increase in the mixed samples of TTR and non - EVs . Under neutral conditions , EVs from TTR - non - producing cell lines bound to puri ﬁ ed TTR and promoted TTR aggregation . In addition , NIH3T3 - EVs showed a higher af ﬁ nity for TTR than HEK293T - EVs . FIGURE 2 | EVs are easily combined with puri ﬁ ed V30M - TTR .

Metabolism of TTR Amyloid by EVs TTR aggregation is promoted under acidic conditions ( Colon and Kelly , 1992 ) . EV - affected TTR aggregation was analyzed using the thio ﬂ avin T ( ThT ) assay . EVs or non - EVs , puri ﬁ ed WT - TTR or V30M - TTR , and acidic buffer were mixed and evaluated ( Figures 2D , E ) . WT - TTR showed a signi ﬁ cant increase in FI values in the presence of NIH3T3 - derived EVs . V30M - TTR showed an increasing trend in FI values in the presence of both NIH3T3 - derived and 293T - derived EVs , with 293T - derived EVs showing a signi ﬁ cant increase in FI values at 12 and 24 h . Overall , the FI values of V30M - TTR were higher than those of WT - TTR . NIH3T3 - EVs and V30M - TTR bound easily , even under acidic conditions , indicating that NIH3T3 - EVs are likely to promote the aggregation of TTR . Serum Extracellular Vesicles Contain Transthyretin and Transthyretin Aggregates , and Serum Extracellular Vesicles Bind to Puri ﬁ ed Transthyretin Reportedly , S - EVs recovered by ultracentrifugation contain TTR aggregates ( Tong et al . , 2017 ) . However , these S - EVs also contain many impurities . Some methods have been used to purify S - EVs , including a two - step puri ﬁ cation method using size exclusion FIGURE 3 | EVs derived from human serum contain TTR , and puri ﬁ ed TTR binds to the serum EVs .

Metabolism of TTR Amyloid by EVs chromatography in combination with the density gradient method ( Onódi et al . , 2018 ) . We have reported that EVs can be easily puri ﬁ ed by the MagCapture method to ensure their high purity ( Nakai et al . , 2016 ) . To investigate whether highly puri ﬁ ed S - EVs also contain TTR and TTR aggregates , S - EVs from healthy individuals were collected by MagCapture and analyzed using the same procedure as that used for cell line - derived EVs . The particle size of S - EVs was analyzed using a nanoparticle meter , which revealed a similar particle size and distribution to those of cell line - derived EVs ( Figures 1C , 3A ) . TTR with multiple molecular weights was detected in the immunoblot of S - EVs , as well as a small amount of TTR aggregates in the high purity S - EV ( Figure 3B ) . As cultured cell - derived EVs promoted TTR aggregation , we performed a similar analysis with serum - derived EVs . S - EVs or non - EVs were mixed with puri ﬁ ed TTR or TTR minus as controls . A ladder - like band was observed in the mixed sample of S - EVs and V30M - TTR , indicating that S - EVs promoted the aggregation of TTR ( Figure 3C ) . In addition , to investigate whether TTR aggregation occurred on the EV surface , EV ELISA was performed using the same samples as those used for immunoblotting . The absorbance increased in the mixed sample of TTR and S - EVs and was higher in V30M - TTR than in WT - TTR ( Figure 3D ) . However , the absorbance did not increase as much as when the cell line - derived EVs were mixed with puri ﬁ ed TTR ( Figures 2B , 3D ) . These ELISA results indicated that V30M - TTR was more easily aggregated on the surface of the S - EVs . As it is dif ﬁ cult to distinguish between S - EVs and lipoprotein impurities by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis ( NTA ) , it is recommended to combine NTA with microscopic analysis ( Bachurski et al . , 2019 ) . Hence , HS - AFM was used to visually analyze the binding of S - EVs to puri ﬁ ed TTR . S - EVs in PBS were ﬁ xed to the substrate and were ﬂ exibly ﬂ uctuated due to their presence in PBS ( Supplemental Figure S1 ) . S - EVs with a height of approximately 20 nm in the Z - axis were mainly observed by HS - AFM : The difference in the height of the S - EVs between Nanosight and HS - AFM was thought to be due to the fact that smaller particles diffuse faster and are preferentially anchored to the substrate , and that the core size of particles was small enough to be observed by HS - AFM , but was effectively estimated larger by the existence of molecules outside S - EVs in Nanosight ( Figure 3E ) . There have been reports of similar results , including one from our group ( Woo et al . , 2016 ; Lim et al . , 2020 , 2021 ) . Furthermore , the detection limit of NTA is about 60 nm ( Bachurski et al . , 2019 ) , and HS - AFM can detect smaller S - EVs that cannot be detected by NTA . The peak particle size in the X – Y axis was 8 . 2 nm ( Figure 3E ) . The binding of V30M - TTR to S - EVs was analyzed under acidic conditions . The height of the S - EVs immobilized on the substrate increased in a time - dependent manner and V30M - TTR - concentration - dependent manner ( Figure 3F ) . As the increase in the size of the EVs surface has resulted in a decrease in mobility and amplitude , the ﬂ uctuations were suppressed when S - EVs and V30M - TTR interacted with correlation coef ﬁ cients : Notably , the surface mobility of EVs appeared to reduce upon addition of TTR . This was con ﬁ rmed by the correlation coef ﬁ cient analysis for the shapes of S - EVs . Thus , the increase in the height of the S - EVs has resulted in a decrease in the surface mobility of S - EVs ( Figure 3G ) . These data suggest that puri ﬁ ed TTR binds to S - EVs and accumulated on EV membranes . Serum - Derived Extracellular Vesicles are Involved in Transthyretin Aggregation and the Deposition of Transthyretin Aggregates on Cells TTR aggregates are deposited on the outside of cells in the stroma . To investigate whether V30M - TTR aggregates were capable of being deposited on the cell periphery , V30M - TTR aggregates , puri ﬁ ed V30M - TTR , and S - EVs were added to the culture cells . First , to con ﬁ rm the pattern of extracellularly deposited V30M - TTR aggregates , a certain amount of V30M - TTR aggregates was added to HEK293T cells . As a result of analysis using TTR aggregate antibodies , almost no deposition signal was detected in cells incubated with S - EVs puri ﬁ ed by MagCaputre compared to those incubated with V30M - TTR aggregates ( Figure 4A ) . Next , we examined whether TTR was aggregated and deposited around the cells when puri ﬁ ed V30M - TTR was added to the cell lines . Speci ﬁ cally , 0 . 22 μ m of ﬁ ltered puri ﬁ ed V30M - TTR was added to HEK293T cells , and TTR aggregates deposited around the cells were detected by the same method , as shown in Figure 4A . V30M - TTR aggregates were not detected in V30M - TTR alone to the same extent as in S - EVs ( Figure 4A ) . However , when V30M - TTR and S - EVs were simultaneously added , cellular deposition of TTR aggregates was more pronounced than that under other conditions ( Figure 4B ) . As PKH - labeled EVs is also likely to observe impurities other than EVs ( Takov et al . , 2017 ) , the analysis was performed using 293T - EVs puri ﬁ ed and labeled by spin column after ultracentrifugation followed by MagCapture . V30M with 293T - EVs not only observed the presence of TTR aggregates but also increased EVs uptake ( Figure 4C ) . These data indicate that S - EVs promote cell deposition with aggregation of V30M - TTR . Amount of EV Markers and TTR Aggregates in Serum EVs Differ Between Patients and Controls In summary , our results showed that S - EVs contain TTR aggregates ( Figure 3B ) and that TTR aggregation is an important process in the pathogenesis of ATTR amyloidosis . Here , we investigated whether there is a difference in the amount of TTR aggregates and EV markers in S - EVs between patients with hereditary ATTRv amyloidosis and the healthy controls . First , we analyzed TTR aggregates by immunoblotting analysis of the EVs of patients with ATTRv amyloidosis and healthy individuals ( N = 6 ) . A higher rate of TTR tetramer and TTR aggregates was observed in the healthy controls ( Figure 5A ) . CD9 , a marker for EVs , had a high rate of low expression in healthy controls ( Figure 5A ) . Next , we performed EV ELISA to quantify the tendency of these TTR aggregates and EV markers . Patient and control serum samples were diluted 2 - fold or 16 - fold , and EV ELISA was performed using a ﬁ xed volume ( 100 µL ) of Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 839917 8 Yamaguchi et al . Metabolism of TTR Amyloid by EVs diluted serum . The absorbance was measured , and the amounts of TTR aggregates and CD63 in the serum EVs were compared . The absorbance of TTR aggregates increased to some extent in the control group , but hardly increased in the patient group ( Figure 5B ) . The absorbance of CD63 increased in both groups but was signi ﬁ cantly higher in the patient group than in the control group ( Figure 5B ) . The amount of TTR aggregates on S - EVs was signi ﬁ cantly lower in the patient group than in the healthy group , and the number of EV markers was signi ﬁ cantly higher in the patient group than in the healthy group . Taken together , as the uptake of EVs , which promote V30M - TTR aggregation , into cells was increased by the complex of V30M - TTR and EVs ( Figures 4A – C ) , increased EVs levels in ATTRv amyloidosis could enhance tissue deposition of TTR aggregates , which follows a decrease of TTR aggregates in the serum of patients with ATTRv amyloidosis ( Figure 5C ) .

Metabolism of TTR Amyloid by EVs DISCUSSION In this study , we showed that TTR present in the blood was also present in serum - derived EVs , and that V30M - TTR aggregation is promoted at the surfaces of membranes such as serum - derived EVs . V30M - TTR aggregation is particularly enhanced in the majority of patients with ATTRv amyloidosis . We also showed that monomeric TTR - V30M promoted aggregation and increased cell deposition in the presence of EVs , even under non - acidic conditions . Compared to healthy subjects , patients with ATTRv amyloidosis showed decreased TTR aggregates and increased EV markers .

Increasing the amount of EVs in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis could further promote this deposition . Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 839917 10 Yamaguchi et al . Metabolism of TTR Amyloid by EVs In amyloidosis , the aggregation of the major causative protein is promoted on the surface of the EV membrane , which is assumed to alleviate the pathological conditions ( Yuyama et al . , 2012 ; Falker et al . , 2016 ) . TTR variant , as a major causative protein , causes TTR aggregation and deposition on speci ﬁ c tissues ( Bezerra et al . , 2020 ) . In this study , we showed via atomic force microscopy that TTR aggregation is promoted by EVs and that TTR multimerizes on the surface of EVs . TTR forms a strong tetramer in serum ( Kanda et al . , 1974 ) and transports thyroxine and vitamin A through the binding region located in the central channel of the tetramer ( Saponaro et al . , 2020 ) . In ATTRv amyloidosis , variants such as V30M in TTR destabilize the tetrameric structure and facilitate aggregation ( Saraiva , 1995 ; Sekijima et al . , 2005 ) . In this study , the ThT assay and in vitro aggregation assay showed that V30M , a major variant of ATTRv amyloidosis , markedly enhanced TTR aggregation , even in the presence of EVs . The in vitro aggregation of TTR is hindered under neutral conditions and promoted under acidic conditions ( Colon and Kelly , 1992 ) . Interestingly , in the presence of EVs , TTR aggregation and cell deposition were promoted in this study , even under non - acidic conditions . The addition of puri ﬁ ed V30M monomer alone did not cause TTR aggregation , as was observed for the addition of EVs alone as a control , suggesting that EVs did in fact induce TTR aggregation . In Alzheimer ’ s disease , EVs remove A β , which is a toxic molecule in the brain ( Pérez - González et al . , 2020 ) . EV proteins accumulate in the brain plaque of patients with Alzheimer ’ s disease , suggesting their strong involvement in the pathogenesis of this disease ( Rajendran et al . , 2006 ) . The enhanced cellular deposition of TTR aggregates by EVs indicates that the EV - mediated tissue deposition of TTR aggregates may be involved in ATTRv amyloidosis as well as Alzheimer ’ s disease . In fact , the amount of EV markers in serum was signi ﬁ cantly higher in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis than in healthy subjects . This suggests that EVs may be actively involved in ATTRv amyloidosis . However , although TTR can be transported throughout the body by the bloodstream , TTR aggregate deposits are found in speci ﬁ c tissues . Various membrane proteins are present on the surface of EV membranes , where they act on speci ﬁ c cells ( Hoshino et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , it is possible that tissue - speci ﬁ c deposition of TTR amyloid is mediated by the EV pathway . A detailed analysis of TTR aggregation in the EV pathway will help further elucidate the pathogenesis of ATTRv amyloidosis . TTR has been implicated in dementia , whereby a lack of TTR can exacerbate cognitive impairment ( Sousa et al . , 2004 ) . With regard to Alzheimer ’ s disease in amyloidosis with dementia , reduced TTR levels have been detected in both the cerebrospinal ﬂ uid and plasma of patients with Alzheimer ’ s disease ( Han et al . , 2011 ; Saponaro et al . , 2020 ) and in subjects with mild cognitive impairment , becoming more pronounced as the disease progresses . A β , which is the major causative protein of Alzheimer ’ s disease , and TTR have also been analyzed molecularly . For example , TTR inhibits the primary and secondary nucleation of A β aggregation , restricting each the toxicity of A β oligomers and the proliferative ability of ﬁ brils ( Ghadami et al . , 2020 ; Gião et al . , 2020 ) , as well as the proteolytic activity of A β ( Saponaro et al . , 2020 ) . In other words , TTR can bind to A β and inhibit A β aggregation and toxicity , suggesting a protecting role for TTR in Alzheimer ’ s disease ( Schwarzman et al . , 1994 ) . As A β promotes aggregation at the surface of EV membranes ( Yuyama et al . , 2012 ) , it appears consistent with the phenomenon of TTR observed in this study . TTR is expressed in the choroid plexus in the brain ( Sakai et al . , 2017 ) in addition to the liver and A β is also expressed in EVs in serum across the brain blood barrier ( Lim et al . , 2019 ) , suggesting that A β and TTR can transfer ﬂ uidly through EVs . Thus , the targeting of A β degradation and A β aggregation inhibition in the brain via EVs and TTR could represent a new therapeutic candidate for Alzheimer ’ s disease . Therefore , it is necessary to further analyze the relationship between TTR and A β in EVs derived from the brain , in addition to EVs derived from the liver and other blood sources .
