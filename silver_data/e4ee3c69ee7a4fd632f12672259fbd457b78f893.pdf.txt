Although the mechanistic details of degradative sorting are well established , the events that define the export pathways remain poorly described 2 . The identification of sorting motifs in the cyto - solic tails of transmembrane proteins that provide the signature for export as well as the membrane remodelling complexes that recog - nise these signatures and drive packaging into transport carriers is central to the understanding of endosomal recycling 3 . Although the sorting motifs for endocytic and Golgi - directed transport are well known , those that control export from the endo - somal network are poorly understood 2 – 4 . The characterization of AP - 1 and the CCC ( CCDC22 , CCDC93 , COMMD ) complex 5 – 7 , Retromer and Retriever , and their associated sorting nexin ( SNX ) cargo adaptors 8 – 16 has identified some export motifs for the sorting of hundreds of integral proteins . However , additional sorting motifs are likely to be required and how their recognition is coordinated with membrane remodelling to form cargo - enriched transport car - riers remains largely unknown for the majority of the identified sorting motifs 17 , 18 . Here , we define the role of a SNX containing a carboxy - terminal Bin , Amphiphysin , Rvs ( BAR ) domain ( SNX – BAR ) membrane - remodelling complex in the sequence - dependent sorting of integral proteins 19 – 24 . Through structural and functional analyses , we iden - tify a sorting motif that is required for endosomal recycling through direct interaction with these SNX – BARs . Our study provides insight into an endosomal coat complex that couples sequence - dependent cargo recognition with the BAR domain - mediated biogenesis of tubulo - vesicular transport carriers . Results Structure of SNX5 bound to the CI - MPR . We recently observed a role for SNX5 , SNX6 and SNX32—a subset of SNX – BAR proteins—in the endosome sorting of the cation - independent mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor ( CI - MPR ) to the TGN 23 , 24 . To provide molecular insight into these observations ( Fig . 1a ) , we mapped the region of SNX5 necessary for CI - MPR binding . As noted by others 25 , protein alignment revealed a 38 - amino - acid insert in the PX domains of these SNX – BAR proteins , which is absent in the PX domain of SNX1 and SNX2—functionally related SNX – BAR proteins that form a heterodimeric complex with SNX5 ( ref . 20 ) but fail to associate with the CI - MPR ( Fig . 1a , b ) . CI - MPR binding could indeed be transferred from SNX5 to SNX1 by engineering a SNX1 – SNX5 switch chimera ( Fig . 1c ) . A green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - nanotrap screen of dele - tion mutants across the CI - MPR cytosolic tail ( covering residues 2328 – 2491 ) established that residues 2347 – 2375 were essential for the SNX5 and SNX6 association ( Fig . 1d ) . A peptide corresponding to these residues bound directly to the isolated SNX5 PX domain ( K d of approximately 25 μ M ; Fig . 1e ) and the corresponding domains of SNX6 and SNX32 ( K d of 24 μ M and 12 μ M , respectively ; Fig . 1e and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Next , we designed a fusion protein constituting the SNX5 PX domain coupled through a flexible linker to the CI - MPR sequence , crystallized the protein in two different crystal forms and determined Molecular identification of a BAR domain - containing coat complex for endosomal recycling of transmembrane proteins Boris Simonetti 1 , 6 , Blessy Paul 2 , 6 , Karina Chaudhari 3 , Saroja Weeratunga 2 , Florian Steinberg 4 , Madhavi Gorla 3 , Kate J .

Cullen 1 , 7 * Protein trafficking requires coat complexes that couple recognition of sorting motifs in transmembrane cargoes with bio - genesis of transport carriers . The mechanisms of cargo transport through the endosomal network are poorly understood . Here , we identify a sorting motif for endosomal recycling of cargoes , including the cation - independent mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor and semaphorin 4C , by the membrane tubulating BAR domain - containing sorting nexins SNX5 and SNX6 . Crystal structures establish that this motif folds into a β - hairpin , which binds a site in the SNX5 / SNX6 phox homology domains . Over sixty cargoes share this motif and require SNX5 / SNX6 for their recycling . These include cargoes involved in neuronal migration and a Drosophila snx6 mutant displays defects in axonal guidance . These studies identify a sorting motif and pro - vide molecular insight into an evolutionary conserved coat complex , the ‘Endosomal SNX – BAR sorting complex for promoting exit 1’ ( ESCPE - 1 ) , which couples sorting motif recognition to the BAR - domain - mediated biogenesis of cargo - enriched tubulo - vesicular transport carriers .

The CI - MPR peptide interacted with the SNX5 PX domain via a β - sheet augmentation , forming two anti - parallel β - strands ( β A and β B ) connected by a long flexible linker . Although the sequences and specific side - chain interactions are different , the bound CI - MPR structures resemble that of the IncE protein from Chlamydia trachomatis 26 – 28 ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , b ) . In both structures , the first β - strand consists of the residues 2349 VSYKYSK 2355 ( Fig . 2a , b ) . The key side chains of SNX5 that medi - ate binding include Arg103 , Met106 , Tyr132 and Phe136 . The Val2349 , Tyr2351 and Tyr2353 side chains in the β A - strand are in close contact with SNX5 , with Tyr2351 forming a stacking interac - tion with SNX5 Phe136 and Val2349 forming a hydrogen bond with SNX5 Arg103 . This mirrors a similar stacking interaction of Phe116 from IncE ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Arg103 from SNX5 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Val2349 , causing it to adopt a substantially different orientation to its pose in the IncE - bound SNX5 structure . The Y2351N and Y2351D mutations com - pletely disrupted the interaction , thus confirming the importance of the 2349 VSYKYSK 2355 residues ( Fig . 2c ) . Interestingly , the second β B - strand included a WLM sequence previously identified as necessary for CI - MPR endosome - to - TGN sorting 29 . There was a major difference in the register of this second β B - strand in the two crystal forms of SNX5 – CI - MPR ( Fig . 2a , b ) , which we confirmed by anomalous difference maps of the SeMet - labelled proteins to unambiguously place the CI - MPR Met2371 side chain ( Fig . 2d ) . The β B strand in Form 1 includes the residues 2369 WLMEEI 2374 , whereas in Form 2 it consists of 2368 EWLMEE 2373 . Therefore , Leu2370 in Form 1 engages a hydrophobic pocket com - posed of the CI - MPR side chains Tyr2351 and Tyr2353 , and the SNX5 side chains Tyr132 , Leu133 and Phe136 ; in Form 2 , the flip in the β B strand orientation results in CI - MPR Met2371 occupying this pocket ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Which of these peptide configurations is pre - ferred ? We theorized that mutation of either Leu2370 or Met2371 to an aspartate side chain would block the interaction with SNX5 , depending on which residue was most favoured . Neither mutation had a major effect on the binding affinity—determined by isother - mal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) experiments—although there was a reduced enthalpy of interaction , whereas mutation of the entire WLM sequence resulted in a larger reduction in binding affinity ( Fig . 2e and Supplementary Table 1 ) . This suggests that the two con - figurations of the β B strand are both equally able to sustain binding ; what is important is not the sequence per se but that a correctly positioned hydrophobic side chain is the main requirement ( either α′ 100 – 117 α″ 118 – 137 α 2 Helix Proline - rich strand 75 100 50 2 % o f t he t o t a l c e ll l ys a t e G F P G F P – S N X 1 G F P – S N X 5 G F P – S N X 6 G F P – S N X 32 G F P – S N X 2 300 aCI - MPR aGFP 25 GFP IP a b d 2 % o f t he t o t a l c e ll l ys a t e CI - MPR tail - GFP GFP IP G F P 2328 – 2491 2337 – 2491 2342 – 2491 2347 – 2491 2355 – 2491 aSNX5 Size ( kDa ) Size ( kDa ) Size ( kDa ) Size ( kDa ) aSNX6 aSNX1 aSNX2 aGFP 50 50 60 60 25 50 CI - MPR into SNX5SNX6SNX32 SNX5 ( F136D ) aSNX5 0 0 0 0 2 4 6 8 Molar ratio ∆ H ( kc a l m o l – 1 ) ( µ c a l s – 1 ) 1 2 – 1 – 2 – 2 – 4 – 6 10 20 30 40 aSNX6 aSNX1 aSNX2 aGFP 50 50 60 60 2 % o f t he t o t a l c e ll l ys a t e GFP – CI - MPR tail GFP IP Time ( min ) G F P 2328 – 2491 2328 – 2402 2328 – 2375 2328 – 2360 25 50 e c aCI - MPR 300 aGFP 75 100 50 25 2 % o f t he t o t a l c e ll l ys a t e G F P G F P – S N X 5 G F P – S N X 1 G F P – 5 PX - S N X 1 c h i m e r a GFP IP Vps5 S . cerevisiae Vps17 S . cerevisiae SNX1 Homo sapiens Snx6 D . melanogaster SNX - 6 C . elegans Snx5 D . rerio Snx5 M . musculus SNX5 H . sapiens SNX6 H . sapiens SNX32 H . sapiens 171339207132648489899084 Fig . 1 | Mapping the interaction between SNX5 and Ci - MPR . a , Co - immunoprecipitation of GFP - tagged SNX – BARs transiently transfected in HEK293T cells . b , Alignment of yeast Vps17 and Vps5 with SNX1 , SNX5 , SNX6 , SNX32 and SNX5 homologues from different species .

Notably , this site in the SNX5 – IncE complex is occupied by a valine side chain ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) .

We performed aspartate mutagenesis across the 2349 VSYKYSK 2355 and 2369 WLM 2371 sequences to identify a mutant that negated SNX5 / SNX6 binding while retaining AP - 1 / AP - 2 asso - ciation ( Fig . 3b ) . Quantitative western blot analysis revealed that the V2349D mutant conveyed a loss of SNX5 / SNX6 binding without a discernible effect on AP - 2 / AP - 1 binding ( Fig . 3b ) . Mutations of the β B - strand caused a minor loss of SNX5 / SNX6 binding , thus con - firming that the 2349 VSYKYSK 2355 motif constitutes the major con - tributor to the interaction ( Fig . 3b ) . To establish the 2349 VSYKYSK 2355 motif as the dominant element of the sorting signal , we generated a HeLa cell line knocked out for CI - MPR . Next , we incorporated a Val2349Asp mutation ( Fig . 3c ) into an expression construct encoding full - length CI - MPR ( Fig . 3d ) . In contrast to the expression of full - length wild - type CI - MPR , which displayed a steady - state enrichment at the TGN46 - and Golgin - 97 - labelled TGN , full - length CI - MPR ( V2349D ) failed to enrich in the TGN and displayed a more prominent endo - somal distribution ( Fig . 3e , f ) . This is consistent with the V2349D mutant retaining the ability to undergo endocytosis and transport from the TGN despite having a defect in retrograde transport . Confirming this , antibody uptake experiments established that both wild - type CI - MPR and the V2349D mutant underwent endo - cytosis , but only the V2349D mutant failed to undergo endosomal export , as defined by enrichment in the TGN ( Fig . 3g ) . Thus , the 2349 VSYKYSK 2355 sorting motif , alongside the 2369 WLM 2371 motif 29 , is required for the SNX5 / SNX6 - dependent endosome - to - TGN transport of the CI - MPR . SNX5 recognition of the CI - MPR sorting motif is required for endosomal export . We next examined the interaction of GFP - tagged SNX5 and an aspartate mutant of the key Phe136 residue ( F136D ; Fig . 4a ) with full - length CI - MPR . Although SNX5 dis - played CI - MPR binding , the GFP – SNX5 ( F136D ) mutant failed to interact in co - immunoprecipitation experiments ( Fig . 4b ) . Importantly , the GFP – SNX5 ( F136D ) mutant retained endosomal association and formed functional BAR - domain - mediated het - erodimers with SNX1 and SNX2 20 , 21 ( Fig . 4b , c ) . The loss of SNX5 and SNX6 expression in a knockout cell line results in the steady - state localization of the CI - MPR shifting from the TGN to periph - erally dispersed endosomes 23 , 24 . In this background , transduction of wild - type GFP – SNX5 rescued CI - MPR sorting , whereas GFP – SNX5 ( F136D ) expression failed to do so ( Fig . 4d – g ) . Overall , by identifying a sorting motif and revealing its mode of recognition by the SNX5 / SNX6 components of the SNX – BAR membrane tubulat - ing complex , these data establish the mechanistic basis of tubular - based endosome - to - TGN export of the CI - MPR . CI - MPR retrograde trafficking requires multiple features of SNX5 - containing heterodimers . SNX5 ( SNX6 and SNX32 ) form functional heterodimers with SNX1 ( and SNX2 ) through their BAR domains 20 , 22 . The resulting SNX1 – SNX5 heterodimers are associ - ated with the cytosolic leaflet of endosomes through multiple fea - tures of these organelles , including specific phosphoinositides and the sensing / induction of membrane curvature . To explore the rela - tionship between membrane association and CI - MPR sorting , we performed rescue experiments with previously validated mutants that perturb aspects of the membrane binding activity of the SNX1 – SNX5 heterodimer : SNX5 ( S226E ) displays a reduced ability to form heterodimers with SNX1 ( and SNX2 ) 31 , SNX1 ( K214A ) pre - vents association with phosphoinositides 19 ( the SNX5 PX domain does not bind phosphoinositides 32 ) , the BAR - domain - targeted SNX1 ( K429E : K430E : R431E ) triple mutant ( SNX1 ( KKR – EEE ) ) is unable to sense or induce membrane curvature 19 and the SNX1 ( M287E : F288E ) double mutant ( SNX1 ( Δ AH ) ) 22 has a defec - tive amphipathic helix required for membrane insertion ( Fig . 5a ) . Co - immunoprecipitations confirmed that SNX5 ( S226E ) dis - played a reduced interaction with SNX1 ( and SNX2 ) but , impor - tantly , had little - to - no effect on the CI - MPR association ( Fig . 5b ) . All of the SNX1 mutants retained SNX5 heterodimer formation and CI - MPR association ( Fig . 5c ) . When expressed in the SNX5 + SNX6 ( SNX5 + 6 ) knockout HeLa cell line , SNX5 ( S226E ) displayed a Fig . 4 | interaction between Ci - MPR and the hydrophobic groove of the SNX5 PX domain is required for Ci - MPR retrograde trafficking . a , CI - MPR peptide bound to the SNX5 hydrophobic groove highlighting Phe136 position . b , Co - immunoprecipitation of GFP - tagged SNX5 and SNX5 ( F136D ) transiently transfected in HEK293T cells ( left ) and a summary of the relative binding levels ( right ) .

The SNX5 ( SNX6 ) - dependent CI - MPR retrograde transport therefore requires the formation of heterodi - mers with SNX1 ( or SNX2 ) and association of the resulting SNX1 – SNX5 complex to the endosomal membrane through sensing of this organelle . With the SNX5 ( F136D ) mutant retaining heterodimer formation and maintaining a localization to endosomes ( Fig . 4c ) , cargo engagement does not seem to be the major driver for endo - somal association of the SNX1 – SNX5 complex . We speculate that cargo recognition may aid cargo clustering and the SNX1 – SNX5 complex as a pre - requisite for the biogenesis of tubular profiles and transport carriers ( Fig . 5g ) . SEMA4C and IGF1R bind to SNX5 through a similar mecha - nism . Do other cargo proteins utilize the same molecular mecha - nism for SNX5 / SNX6 - mediated endosomal sorting ? In addition to CI - MPR , IGF1R ( a receptor critical in malignant transformation ) and SEMA4C ( a plexin B2 receptor involved in axon guidance ) are two cell surface transmembrane proteins that interact with SNX5 24 . Co - immunoprecipitations of GFP – SNX5 and GFP – SNX5 ( F136D ) established that SNX5 binds to these proteins through the conserved CI - MPR binding site within the PX domain ( Fig . 6a ) . Truncation mutagenesis identified residues 731 – 755 of SEMA4C and residues 1275 – 1285 of IGF1R in SNX5 binding ( Fig . 6b , c ) . Using the cor - responding peptides , binding of SEMA4C and IGF1R to the PX domain of SNX5 was direct and with micromolar affinities ( K d of 26 and 15 μ M , respectively ) , which is comparable to those observed for CI - MPR ( Fig . 6d , e and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Although we were unable to obtain diffracting crystals for the SNX5 – IGF1R complex , crystals of the SNX5 PX domain with the SEMA4C sequence were grown and the structure was determined at a resolution of 2 . 45 Å ( Fig . 6f and Supplementary Table 2 ) . SEMA4C interacts with SNX5 via a similar anti - parallel β A - and β B - sheet augmentation , with the 734 VGYYYS 739 peptide making the first β - strand , followed by a tight turn ( residues 740 DGS 742 ) and then the Leu743 side chain engaging the hydrophobic pocket where Leu2370 or Met2371 are bound in the CI - MPR structures ( Fig . 6f ) . Immunoprecipitations of GFP - tagged SEMA4C cytosolic - tail mutants , probing for endogenous SNX5 association , confirmed that the 734 VGYYYS 739 sequence was required for the SNX5 – SEMA4C association ( Fig . 6g ) . In examining the sequence of the IGF1R peptide ( residues 1275 – 1285 ) , we noted a 1277 VSFYYS 1282 sequence very similar to the β A strand of SEMA4C and CI - MPR ( 734 VGYYYS 739 and 2349 VSYKYS 2355 , respectively ) . Immunoprecipitation using the wild - type GFP - tagged IGF1R tail and mutants targeting the 1277 VSFYYS 1282 sequence con - firmed that this is required for the SNX5 interaction ( Fig . 6h ) . In contrast to the role of SNX5 / SNX6 in the endosome - to - TGN transport of the CI - MPR , the role of these SNX – BARs in the sorting of the IGF1R is distinct 24 . Following ligand activation at the cell surface , the IGF1R undergoes internalization and enters the endosomal network for its SNX5 / SNX6 - dependent recycling to the cell surface . Thus , the internalized IGF1R in SNX5 and SNX6 double - knockout cells fails to engage the recycling itinerary and instead enters the lysosomal degradative pathway 24 . To extend this analysis into its functional role during endosome - to - plasma membrane recycling , we introduced the F1279D mutant into full - length IGF1R and confirmed that this displayed a clear loss of endogenous SNX5 binding ( Fig . 7a ) . We introduced wild - type IGF1R or IGF1R ( F1279D ) into an IGF1R - knockout HeLa cell line . Importantly , the mutation did not affect receptor function , as defined by the activation of ERK – MAPK following IGF - 1 stimu - lation ( Fig . 7b ) . Consistent with the 1277 VSFYYS 1282 sequence being a sorting motif , long - term IGF - 1 stimulation of IGF1R ( F1279D ) resulted in mis - sorting into the lysosomal degradative pathway ( Fig . 7c ) . In addition , IGF1R was degraded in the SNX5 and SNX6 double - knockout cells , and re - expression of SNX5 , but not of the SNX5 ( F136D ) mutant , rescued the IGF1R degradative fate and promoted cell surface recycling ( Fig . 7d , e ) . These data establish that SNX5 ( as well as SNX6 / SNX32 ) engage the cyto - solic tail of cargoes through the recognition of a ‘promiscuous’ β - hairpin structure .

We selected the following transmembrane proteins for further validation : ROBO1 , a receptor in axon guidance and neuronal precursor cell migration 33 ; TMEM230 , a protein linked to Parkinson’s disease 34 and GPR50 , a regulator of melatonin and TGF β signalling 35 . Immunoprecipitation of GFP - tagged SNX5 and the F136D mutant validated the Phe136 - dependent association to SNX5 ( Fig . 8b ) . Moreover , alignment of their cytosolic tails with CI - MPR , SEMA4C and IGF1R revealed the presence of the 1309 HTYGY 1313 , 40 IPYKA 44 and 317 IFFSG 321 sequences in ROBO1 , TMEM230 and GPR50 , respectively , which conform with a general Ф x Ω x Ф consensus motif for the β A strand ( Ф and Ω , hydrophobic and aromatic side chains , respectively ; Fig . 8c ) . A limitation of the interactome - based analysis is the reliance on sufficient interacting protein being retained through the immunoprecipitation methodology for identification and quanti - fication by LC – MS / MS , key determinants of which are the abun - dance of the interacting protein and its SNX5 binding affinity . To expand the cargoes and identify low - abundance and / or low - affinity cargoes , we designed a functionally orientated proteomic analysis to quantify how the altered cell surface proteome in SNX5 + 6 knock - out cells was rescued by wild - type SNX5 or SNX5 ( F136D ) . SNX5 + 6 knockout cells and knockout cells transduced with wild - type SNX5 or SNX5 ( F136D ) were subjected to surface biotinylation and TMT labelling to quantify the proteomic data ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . Of the transmembrane proteins that displayed decreased levels in the SNX5 + 6 knockout cells compared with the cells rescued with SNX5 , 61 were significantly depleted from the plasma membrane of cells expressing SNX5 ( F136D ) compared with the wild - type ( Fig . 8d and Supplementary Fig . 2d ) .

A Panther gene - ontology analysis revealed enrichment for proteins involved in ‘axonal guidance’ , ‘neuronal morphogenesis’ ( for example , L1CAM , ROBO1 , SEMA4C , PLXNA3 and CELSR2 ) and ‘cell migration’ ( for example , ITGA6 and ADAM17 ; Fig . 8e ) , and , importantly , sequence analysis revealed that 20 proteins contain a putative Ф x Ω x Ф motif in their cytosolic tails ( Fig . 8f ) . In vivo studies establish a role for Drosophila snx - 6 in axonal guidance . Finally , we considered the evolutionary conserved helix - turn - helix extension in the PX domain ( Fig . 1b ) and the aforemen - tioned gene - ontology analysis by examining axon guidance in the Drosophila embryonic central nervous system . We initially tested whether loss - of - function mutations in either snx1 or snx6 result in defects in axon guidance at the midline by examining late - stage embryos with markers to label all axons ( horseradish peroxidase ) or subsets of ipsilaterally projecting interneurons ( Fasciclin II , FasII ; Drosophila encode a single SNX5 / SNX6 ortholog , snx6 ) . Neither snx1 nor snx6 zygotic mutants resulted in dramatic defects in this coarse - level analysis ; however , Snx1 and Snx6 are maternally deposited ( https : / / flybase . org / ) , and this could potentially prevent the detection of phenotypes 36 . We turned to sensitized genetic backgrounds to analyse the roles for the Snx1 and Snx6 proteins more carefully . First , we analysed reducing snx1 and snx6 genes in embryos heterozygous for mutations in slit —the major mid - line repellent—and its neuronal receptor robo 37 ( Fig . 8g , i ) . In this background , a small percentage of FasII - positive axons abnormally cross the midline and mutations in other genes involved in midline guidance can modify this phenotype to reveal roles in promoting or inhibiting midline crossing 38 . Removing one copy of either snx1 or snx6 significantly attenuated the midline - crossing defects in this background , with a simultaneous reduction of both snx1 and snx6 leading to a greater reduction in ectopic crossing ( Fig . 8g , i ) . Next , we made use of a second genetic background where normal midline crossing of commissural axons is partially disrupted . In this case , expression of a truncated Frazzled receptor ( Fra ∆ C ) in a subset of commissural axons resulted in the failure of a small percentage of axons to cross the midline . Similar to the slit , robo background , mutations in other genes involved in midline guidance can modify this phenotype to reveal roles in either promoting or inhibiting midline crossing 39 . Midline crossing defects were not significantly altered for embryos in this background , which are heterozygous for either snx1 or snx6 , whereas a simultaneous reduction of both snx1 and snx6 led to a striking enhancement in the percentage of axons that failed to cross the midline ( Fig . 8h , j ) . Our preliminary genetic analysis is suggestive of a role of these snx genes in promoting the normal axonal growth across the midline . Discussion The BAR - domain - containing SNX5 and SNX6 drive the biogenesis of tubular profiles and tubulo - vesicular transport carriers through the formation of heterodimeric assemblies with SNX1 or SNX2 19 , 22 . Here , we establish that a conserved hydrophobic groove in the PX domains of SNX5 and SNX6 ( and presumably the related neuro - nal SNX32 ) associates with a Ф x Ω x Ф ( x ) n Ф motif present in the cytosolic tails of numerous integral proteins ( x , any amino acid ; n , variable linker region ) . Our study therefore establishes that SNX1 / SNX2 – SNX5 / SNX6 heterodimers co - ordinate sequence - dependent cargo recognition with the biogenesis of tubulo - vesicular transport carriers for cargo export from the endosomal network . The degradative capacity of lysosomes relies on the delivery of over 60 acid hydrolases from the biosynthetic pathway by means of membrane transport 40 . Their lysosomal delivery requires asso - ciation with the CI - MPR at the TGN 30 . Transport of the CI - MPR – hydrolase complex from the TGN is mediated by clathrin - coated Fig . 8 | identification of a Ф x Ω x Ф consensus motif for SNX5 - mediated cargo recruitment . a , Comparative interactome analysis of wild - type SNX5 versus the SNX5 ( F136D ) mutant across n = 3 independent experiments using a one - sample t - test and Benjamini – Hochberg false - discovery rate .

Following fusion with the endosome , expo - sure to the acidic environment leads to hydrolase dissociation of the CI - MPR – hydrolase complex , which moves into the lysosome and becomes enzymatically active following endosome – lysosome fusion 41 . For continued hydrolase delivery , the unbound CI - MPR is sorted from the endosome into tubulo - vesicular transport carriers for transport back to the TGN 42 , 43 . The details of this step in CI - MPR sorting have remained elusive 44 . A number of molecules have been implicated , including TIP47 and the Rab9 GTPase 45 , PACS - 1 ( ref . 46 ) , AP - 1 ( ref . 47 ) , AP - 5 ( ref . 48 ) and the Retromer complex 44 , but their a aCI - MPR aROBO1 aGFP aTMEM230 aSEMA4C SNX5 ( F136D ) R e l a i v e p r o t e i n s i gna l no r m a li z ed t o G F P SNX5 * * * * * * * * * * * * 2 % o f t he t o t a l c e ll l ys a t e G F P G F P – S N X 5 G F P – S N X 5 ( F 136 D ) 300 200 90 15 75 50 25 aGPR50 R O B O 1 T M E M 230 G P R 50 aSNX2 CI - MPR SEMA4C IGF1RROBO1 TMEM230 GPR50 150 100 50 0 aGFP 1 % o f t he t o t a l c e ll l ys a t e G F P G F P – S N X 5 G F P – S N X 5 ( F 136 D ) GFP IP 60 75 50 25 60 GFP IP d b e c – l og 10 [ P v a l ue ] log 2 [ Abundance ratio ( GFP – SNX5 ( F136D ) versus GFP – SNX5 ] ABCE1 SEMA4C TMEM230 IGF1R INSR GPR50 4 . 5 4 3 . 5 3 2 . 5 2 1 . 5 0 . 5 0 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 1 CI - MPR ROBO1 CLMN KCT2 SNX1 SNX2 Transmembrane interactors lost by the F136D mutant ABCC1 CI - MPR MRC2 IGF1R SLCO3A1 LRP8 SSR4 L1CAM ATP11A SLC9A6 EMR2TFRC IGSF3 SLC44A2 SLC6A6C3orf33 MUC16 CXCR4 SLC39A8PIEZO1 SIGMAR1 SLC22A5 ADAM17 HS6ST2 CD151 SLC6A9 SLC25A22 NPTNPODXL IFNAR1GOLIM4 GGT1 BTN3A3 CELSR2 SLC16A3 ITGA6 PLXNA3 ITGA5 RESDA1 MET SLC16A7 CELSR1 PTK7 ATP1B1 DISP1 CSPG4 ATP2B4 ROBO1 PTPRM PIEZO1 HLA - A MMP15 RFT1 TMX1 SLC7A1 SLC7A6 EMD DAG1 ATP2B1LPCAT1 CCDC47 log 2 [ Abundance ratio ( SNX5 + 6 KO + GFP – SNX5 ( F136D ) versus SNX5 + 6 KO + GFP – SNX5 ] – l og 10 [ P v a l ue ] Transmembrane proteins depleted from the cell surface of SNX5 + 6 KO cells and not rescued by GFP – SNX5 ( F136D ) Cell migration , motility and locomotion Viral entry into host cell Axon guidance Neuron - projection morphogenesis Positive regulation of cell adhesion Regulation of chemotaxis Neuron - projection development Regulation of cell migration Metal - ion homeostasis Cell - surface - receptor signalling pathway Gene ontology fold enrichment f 0 10 20 30 40 50 ABCC1 1520 - PIEZO1 2503 - SLC39A8 108 - L1CAM 1223 - LRP8 888 - PTPRM 1438 - SLCO3A1 693 - SIGMAR1 118 - IFNAR1 466 - ATP2B4 1092 - SLC7A1 98 - CELSR2 2917 - SLC7A6 110 - SLC44A2 354 - BTN3A3 482 - PLXNA3 1692 - ATP11A 11 - ATP2B1 1106 - DAG1 890 - ADAM17 807 - Φ x Ω x Φ Φ x Ω x Φ Carboxylic - acid transmembrane transport T G N AP - 1 SNX3 Retromer SNX17Retriever ESCPE - 1 SNX27Retromer AP - 5 PM Late endosome Recycling ( direct and / or via the ERC ) Recycling ( direct and / or via the ERC ) CI - MPR / IGF1R E a r l y endo s o m e IGF1R / CI - MPR ESCPE - 1 AP - 1 M a t u r a t i on AP - 1 YxxØ , [ DE ] xxxL [ LI ] CI - MPR AP - 5 ?

Our structural identification and validation of the sorting motif in the CI - MPR and its recognition by the SNX5 and SNX6 components of the SNX1 / SNX2 – SNX5 / SNX6 membrane tubulating complex has provided a detailed mechanistic framework on which to elucidate the early sorting steps of this important pathway . How this insight interfaces with existing models of CI - MPR sort - ing , most notably with regard to Retromer , remains controversial 44 . The yeast Retromer , identified in yeast as a coat complex involved in endosome - to - Golgi transport 8 , is a stable pentamer of two sub - com - plexes : a Vps26 , Vps35 and Vps29 heterotrimer , and a heterodimer of the SNX – BAR proteins Vps5 and Vps17 . In higher metazoans , the VPS26 – VPS35 – VPS29 heterotrimer 9 , 10 does not form a stable pentameric assembly with the corresponding SNX1 / SNX2 – SNX5 / SNX6 heterodimer ( SNX1 and SNX2 being Vps5 orthologs , with SNX5 and SNX6 being Vps17 orthologs ) 19 , 20 . Moreover , the human VPS26 – VPS35 – VPS29 heterotrimer can function independently of the SNX1 / SNX2 – SNX5 / SNX6 heterodimer in cargo sorting 23 , 24 , a conclusion recently extended in vivo through the endosomal sorting of planar cell polarity proteins in the Drosophila wing 49 . Although it cannot be excluded that a metazoan yeast - like pentameric Retromer complex may assemble under certain specific condition ( s ) , the divergence in the association and functional interaction between the two complexes would argue that such a pentameric complex may form only a minor functional population . In metazoans , the divergence away from the yeast pentameric complex has led to a refined nomenclature where the VPS26 – VPS35 – VPS29 heterotri - mer is referred to as Retromer 50 . The evolution of Retromer and the SNX1 / SNX2 – SNX5 / SNX6 complex into separate functional complexes is paralleled by Retromer acquiring a number of interactions with proteins not found in yeast , including sorting nexin - 27 ( SNX27 ) 13 , 14 , 51 , the actin polymerizing WASH complex 52 – 54 and ANKRD50 ( ref . 55 , 56 ) . Equally , the functional role of Retromer has expanded to include the sorting of hundreds of cargoes to the cell surface 2 . The evolution in diversity can now be extended to the SNX1 / SNX2 – SNX5 / SNX6 heterodimer . The extended helix - loop - helix cargo - binding groove in SNX5 and SNX6 is absent from yeast Vps17 ( Fig . 1b ) . This mode of sequence - dependent cargo recognition is therefore not a feature shared with the yeast pentameric Retromer . However , the conservation of the hydrophobic groove in Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila melano - gaster and Danio rerio ( Fig . 1b ) , indicates that an equivalent mode of sequence - dependent endosomal sorting is likely to exist across these organisms , a conclusion supported by our preliminary analy - sis of axonal guidance in Drosophila . A number of studies have highlighted the mammalian Retromer in the endosome - to - TGN transport of the CI - MPR 44 . Here , cargo selection is proposed to occur through the recognition of the 2369 WLM 2371 motif at an interface between VPS26 and the non - BAR - domain - containing sorting nexin SNX3 ( ref . 15 ) . Although structural evidence remains to be established , both Retromer and SNX3 can mediate CI - MPR transport in carriers that depend on the Golgin GCC88 for tethering at the TGN 57 . In contrast , SNX1 and SNX2 ( and by extension SNX5 and SNX6 ) mediate CI - MPR trafficking in car - riers dependent on the Golgin - 245 tether , leading to the proposal of two independent pathways for CI - MPR sorting to the TGN : a SNX3 – Retromer pathway 57 and a separate pathway dependent on SNX1 / SNX2 – SNX5 / SNX6 ( ref . 23 , 24 ) . In addition , AP - 1 and AP - 5 adap - tors mediate endosome - to - TGN CI - MPR transport 43 , 58 , 59 ( Fig . 8k ) . Disentangling the sequential versus concurrent relationship of these pathways will provide invaluable insight into the global organiza - tion of the endosome - to - TGN transport pathways . For the SNX1 / SNX2 – SNX5 / SNX6 coat complex , cargoes that are exported from the endosomal network through engaging SNX5 / SNX6 can be sorted to ( at least ) two distinct destinations : for IGF1R ( and numerous other cargoes ) a steady - state cell surface enrichment and a TGN - enrichment for the CI - MPR 23 , 24 ( Fig . 8k ) . Which prin - ciples govern how recognition of similar motifs by the same sorting complex ultimately lead to cargo sorting to the plasma membrane versus the TGN ? At present , we have no direct experimental data to address this fundamental question . However , von Zastrow and colleagues have documented that endosomal exit of two cargo pro - teins , β 2 - adrenergic receptor and Wntless , occurs through a shared tubular profile , although their steady - state enrichments are ulti - mately defined as the cell surface and TGN , respectively 60 . Although the mechanistic basis of these sorting events are distinct , sorting of the β 2 - adrenergic receptor and Wntless is Retromer - dependent 23 , 24 and the central problem is conceptually the same . Similar to the mechanism suggested for the β 2 - adrenergic receptor and Wntless 60 , we believe that the relative enrichment of the two cargoes is an important element in their sorting itineraries . Following activation , IGF1R enters the endosomal network from the cell surface while the majority of the CI - MPR undergoes continual rounds of TGN - to - endosome and endosome - to - TGN transport from maturing endo - somes . The relative enrichment of the two cargoes therefore reflects the maturation status of the endosome : endocytosed IGF1R ( and other cell surface cargoes ) will be enriched in newly formed endo - somes , whereas CI - MPR will be enriched in the ‘late’ endosomes . Tubular exit across the endosomal maturation pathway promoted by SNX1 / SNX2 – SNX5 / SNX6 will therefore display distinct cargo enrichments : early exit will favour IGF1R over CI - MPR , whereas later exit favours CI - MPR over IGF1R . If early exit promotes entry into cell surface recycling pathways ( either directly or via the endo - cytic recycling compartment ) and late exit promotes entry into ret - rograde transport pathways , then such a sorting ‘refinery’ would achieve differential sorting . Such sorting may not immediately result in the correct steady - state localization for all cargoes—for example , some IGF1R may reach the TGN—but the inter - connected nature of membrane trafficking pathways provides a route for cell surface delivery through re - secretion ( Fig . 8k ) . There is indeed evidence for cell surface cargoes , such as β 1 - integrin , being recycled through the TGN 61 . The presence of such ‘sub - refineries’ , including the TGN and the endocytic recycling compartment , would provide further plat - forms for differential sorting . Finally , the interaction between C . trachomatis effector IncE and SNX5 / SNX6 serves to manipulate host mechanisms to promote pathogen survival and replication in the intracellular environment of the host 26 , 62 . The secreted IncE is associated with the cytosolic face of the C . trachomatis inclusion body from where it recruits SNX5 and SNX6 , and overrides the normal endosome association of these SNX – BARs 2 , 62 . This leads to a defect in the CI - MPR endosome - to - TGN transport 26 – 28 , 62 . Our structural description of CI - MPR bind - ing to SNX5 / SNX6 and its resemblance to that of IncE establishes a molecular explanation for this phenotype . With the importance of CI - MPR recycling for hydrolase delivery and lysosomal degradative health , C . trachomatis may induce perturbation in this pathway to reduce the restrictive role of this organelle . Our analysis has identi - fied a number of signalling receptors that require SNX5 / SNX6 for their endosomal sorting , which are likely to provide insight into the significance of IncE - perturbed SNX5 / SNX6 trafficking . One way by which C . trachomatis secures survival of the host cell is by modulat - ing the MEK – ERK and PI 3 - kinase survival pathway downstream of EPHA2 receptor activation . This receptor is internalized with , and retained on , the maturing inclusion from where it triggers long - last - ing anti - apoptotic signalling 63 . It is tempting to speculate that the secreted IncE , by preventing the SNX5 / SNX6 - mediated transport of active signalling receptors away from the inclusion , may ensure retention of pro - survival signalling receptors during replication . Overall , we have identified a mechanism through which the endosome - associated SNX1 / SNX2 – SNX5 / SNX6 coat complex coordinates sequence - dependent cargo recognition with mem - brane remodelling to generate cargo - enriched tubulo - vesicular NAtuRe Cell BioloGy | VOL 21 | OCTOBER 2019 | 1219 – 1233 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 1231 Articles NATuRE CEll BiOlOgy transport carriers . We have provided evidence that this mechanism is required for the export of numerous cargoes from the endosomal network for onward transport to the TGN and the cell surface . To highlight this function and to reflect that the mammalian VPS26 – VPS35 – VPS29 Retromer and the SNX1 / SNX2 – SNX5 / SNX6 coat complex have functionally diversified , we propose to refer to the SNX1 / SNX2 – SNX5 / SNX6 coat complex as the ‘Endosomal SNX – BAR sorting complex for promoting exit - 1’ ( ESCPE - 1 ; Fig . 8k ) . We speculate that additional ESCPE complexes may function in sequence - mediated tubulo - vesicular - based endosomal sorting . online content Any methods , additional references , Nature Research reporting summaries , source data , statements of code and data availability and associated accession codes are available at https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41556 - 019 - 0393 - 3 .

Cell culture and transfection . The HeLa , HEK293T and RPE1 cell lines were originally sourced from the American Type Culture Collection . Authentication was from the American Type Culture Collection . We did not independently authenticate the cell lines . The parental HeLa cells used for the generation of all CRISPR - edited cell lines were mycoplasma tested , which revealed no contamination . Our HEK293T cell line also tested negative for mycoplasma contamination . No commonly misidentified cell lines were used . Cells were grown in DMEM medium ( Sigma - Aldrich ) supplemented with 10 % ( vol / vol ) FCS ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco ) , and grown under standard conditions . FuGENE HD ( Promega ) was used for transient transfection of DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions . For the isolation of CRISPR – Cas9 clonal lines , HeLa cells were transfected with pX330 plasmid coding for the genomic RNA ( gRNA ) of the gene of interest together with a puromycin - resistance - expressing plasmid . The cells were then subjected to puromycin selection for 24 h . The cells were subsequently resuspended using accutase ( BioLegend ) and diluted to 2 . 5 cells ml − 1 in Iscov’s modified Dulbecco’s medium ( Sigma - Aldrich ) supplemented with 10 % ( vol / vol ) FBS ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Next , 200 µ l was plated in the wells of 10 × 96 - well plates and the plates were screened for the presence of cell colonies after three weeks . The cell colonies were expanded and subjected to lysis and western blotting to determine the levels of the target proteins . The SNX5 + 6 double - knockout cell line used in this study was characterized previously ( clone13 in 23 ) ; the SNX1 + 2 double - knockout cell line used in this study was also characterized previously ( clone4 in 23 ) . The CI - MPR - knockout cell line was generated for this study using the following three gRNAs : 5 ′ - GCTTGTCCTGAGTTACGTGA - 3 ′ , 5 ′ - GTGTGCACTACTTTGAGTGG - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - GAGAAGGAAGACCTCCTCTG - 3 ′ . The IGF1R - knockout cell line was generated for this study using the following three gRNAs : 5 ′ - GATGATGCGATTCTTCGACG - 3 ′ , 5 ′ - GGTTGGGGAAGAGGTCTCCG - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - GGAGAACGACCATATCCGTG - 3 ′ . Generation of stable lentiviral RPE1 cell lines . The gene of interest was subcloned into the lentiviral vector pXLG3 for the generation of lentiviral particles . Lentiviral particles were produced and harvested in HEK293T cells . HeLa cells were transduced with near - to - endogenous levels of lentiviral particles to produce stably expressing cell lines . Transduced HeLa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % ( vol / vol ) FCS and penicillin / streptomycin and grown at 37 °C in a 5 % CO 2 incubator . Immunoprecipitation and quantitative western blot analysis . Cells were lysed in PBS with 1 % Triton X - 100 and protease inhibitor cocktail for western blotting . The protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and equal amounts were resolved on NuPAGE 4 – 12 % precast gels ( Invitrogen ) . Blotting was performed onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes ( Immobilon - FL , EMD Millipore ) , followed by detection using the Odyssey infrared scanning system ( LI - COR Biosciences ) . When using the Odyssey , we routinely performed western blot analysis where a single blot was simultaneously probed with antibodies against two proteins of interest ( distinct antibody species ) , followed by visualization with the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated to distinct spectral dyes . For the GFP - based immunoprecipitations , HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP constructs using polyethylenimine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer ( 50 mM Tris – HCl , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 and Roche protease inhibitor cocktail ) 48 h after transfection and subjected to GFP - trap ( ChromoTek ) or myc - tap ( ChromoTek ) beads . Immunoblotting was performed using standard procedures . Detection was performed on an Odyssey infrared scanning system ( LI - COR Biosciences ) using fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies . Biotinylation of cell surface proteins . For the surface biotinylation experiments , fresh Sulfo NHS - SS - Biotin ( cat . no . 21217 , Thermo Scientific ) was dissolved in ice - cold PBS at pH 7 . 8 at a final concentration of 0 . 2 mg ml − 1 . Cells were washed twice in ice - cold PBS and placed on ice to slow down the endocytic pathway . Next , the cells were incubated with the biotinylation reagent for 30 min at 4 °C , followed by incubation in TBS for 10 min to quench the unbound biotin . The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer and subjected to Streptavidin - bead - based affinity isolation ( GE Healthcare ) . TMT labelling and high pH reversed - phase chromatography . Samples were digested overnight with 2 . 5 µ g trypsin at 37 °C , labelled with TMT ten - plex reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and the labelled samples were pooled . The pooled sample was then dried by evaporation , resuspended in 5 % formic acid and desalted using a SepPak cartridge according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Waters ) . The eluate from the SepPak cartridge was again dried by evaporation and resuspended in buffer A ( 20 mM ammonium hydroxide , pH 10 ) before fractionation by high pH reversed - phase chromatography using an UltiMate 3000 liquid chromatography system ( Thermo Scientific ) . Briefly , the sample was loaded onto an XBridge BEH C18 column ( 130 Å , 3 . 5 µ m , 2 . 1 mm × 150 mm ; Waters ) in buffer A and the peptides were eluted with an increasing gradient of buffer B ( 20 mM ammonium hydroxide in acetonitrile , pH 10 ) from 0 – 95 % over 60 min . The resulting fractions were dried by evaporation and resuspended in 1 % formic acid before analysis by nano - LC – MS / MS using an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer ( Thermo Scientific ) . Nano - LC – MS / MS . The high pH reversed - phase fractions were further fractionated using an UltiMate 3000 nano - LC system in line with an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer ( Thermo Scientific ) . Briefly , peptides in 1 % ( vol / vol ) formic acid were injected onto an Acclaim PepMap C18 nanotrap column ( Thermo Scientific ) . After washing with 0 . 5 % ( vol / vol ) acetonitrile in 0 . 1 % ( vol / vol ) formic acid , the peptides were resolved on a 250 mm × 75 μ m Acclaim PepMap C18 reverse - phase analytical column ( Thermo Scientific ) over a 150 min organic gradient , using seven gradient segments ( 1 – 6 % solvent B over 1 min , 6 – 15 % solvent B over 58 min , 15 – 32 % solvent B over 58 min , 32 – 40 % solvent B over 5 min , 40 – 90 % solvent B over 1 min , held at 90 % solvent B for 6 min and then reduced to 1 % solvent B over 1 min ) with a flow rate of 300 nl min − 1 . Solvent A was 0 . 1 % formic acid and solvent B was aqueous 80 % acetonitrile in 0 . 1 % formic acid . The peptides were ionized by nano - electrospray ionization at 2 . 0 kV using a stainless steel emitter with an internal diameter of 30 μ m ( Thermo Scientific ) and a capillary temperature of 275 °C . All spectra were acquired using an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer controlled by Xcalibur 2 . 0 software ( Thermo Scientific ) and operated in data - dependent acquisition mode using an SPS - MS3 workflow . FTMS1 spectra were collected at a resolution of 120 , 000 , with an automatic - gain - control target of 200 , 000 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms . Precursors were filtered with an intensity threshold of 5 , 000 , according to the charge state ( to include charge states 2 – 7 ) and with monoisotopic precursor selection . Previously interrogated precursors were excluded using a dynamic window ( 60 s ± 10 ppm ) . The MS2 precursors were isolated with a quadrupole mass filter set to a width of 1 . 2 m / z . ITMS2 spectra were collected with an automatic - gain - control target of 10 , 000 , maximum injection time of 70 ms and CID collision energy of 35 % . For the FTMS3 analysis , the Orbitrap was operated at a resolution of 50 , 000 with an automatic - gain - control target of 50 , 000 and a maximum injection time of 105 ms . The precursors were fragmented by high - energy collision dissociation at a normalized collision energy of 60 % to ensure maximal TMT reporter - ion yield . Synchronous precursor selection was enabled to include up to five MS2 fragment ions in the FTMS3 scan . Data analysis . The raw data files were processed and quantified using Proteome Discoverer software v2 . 1 ( Thermo Scientific ) and searched against the UniProt human database ( downloaded 14 September 2017 ; 140 , 000 sequences ) using the SEQUEST algorithm . The peptide precursor mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm and MS / MS tolerance was set at 0 . 6 Da . Search criteria included oxidation of methionine ( + 15 . 9949 ) as a variable modification , and carbamidomethylation of cysteine ( + 57 . 0214 ) and the addition of the TMT ( + 229 . 163 ) to the peptide N termini and lysine as fixed modifications . The searches were performed with full tryptic digestion and a maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed . The reverse database search option was enabled and the data were filtered to satisfy a false - discovery rate of 5 % . The Perseus software platform was used for the statistical analysis of the proteomics datasets 64 . Immunofluorescence staining . Cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min , washed in PBS and then permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . The fixed cells were blocked in 1 % BSA and incubated in primary antibody and the respective secondary antibody ( Alexa Fluor ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) in 1 % BSA . NAtuRe Cell BioloGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATuRE CEll BiOlOgy For the aCI - MPR antibody uptake assay , HeLa cells were transferred to a well containing 3 ml ice - cold DHB ( DMEM supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 1 % ( vol / vol ) FCS ) for 15 min to stop the trafficking processes . Surface CI - MPR was labelled by incubation for 30 min in cold DHB containing an antibody targeting the extracellular domain of the receptor ( clone 2G11 ; MA1 - 066 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Coverslips were washed twice in ice - cold PBS , transferred to pre - warmed growth media and returned to the incubator for 40 min to allow uptake of the anti - CI - MPR to occur . The cells were then washed , fixed and immunostained . Image acquisition and analysis . Microscopy images were collected with a confocal laser scanning microscope ( SP5 AOBS , Leica Microsystems ) attached to an inverted epifluorescence microscope ( DMI6000 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . A × 63 1 . 4 NA ( numerical - aperture ) oil - immersion objective ( Plan Apochromat BL , Leica Biosystems ) and the standard SP5 system acquisition software and detector were used . Images were captured at room temperature as z stacks with photomultiplier tube detectors with a photocathode made of gallium - arsenide - phosphide ( Leica Microsystems ) for collecting light emission . The images were captured using Application Suite AF software ( version 2 . 7 . 3 . 9723 ; Leica Microsystems ) and then analysed with Volocity 6 . 3 software ( PerkinElmer ) . For colocalization studies , Pearson’s correlation colocalization coefficient was measured using the method of Costes to set automatic thresholds . For the quantification of CI - MPR tubules , an individual tubular profile was scored based on a length that was ≥ 3 µ m . Protein expression and purification . The constructs for bacterial expression of glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - tagged PX domains of human SNX5 ( residues 22 – 170 ) , SNX6 ( residues 26 – 170 ) and SNX32 ( residues 17 – 166 ) were described previously 27 . The genes encoding the human SNX5 PX domain ( residues 22 – 170 ) with C - terminal fusions of the CI - MPR sequence ( residues 2347 – 2377 ) or SEMA4C sequence ( residues 731 – 755 ) were codon optimized and synthesized by Genscript and cloned into pGEX4T - 2 . The GST - tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 codon plus supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics . Single colonies from cultures grown on lysogeny - broth ( LB ) agar plates were inoculated into 50 ml LB media supplemented with ampicillin ( 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 ) and chloramphenicol ( 0 . 034 mg ml − 1 ) , and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking . The following day , 30 ml from the overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 l LB media containing ampicillin ( 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 ) and chloramphenicol ( 0 . 034 mg ml − 1 ) , and incubated at 37 °C . The cells were cultured to an optical density of 0 . 7 – 0 . 8 at 600 nm and induced with 0 . 5 mM isopropyl - β - d - thiogalactopyranoside . The cultures were incubated with shaking overnight at 18 °C . The cells were harvested using a Beckman rotor JLA 8 . 1000 at 4 , 000 r . p . m . for 15 min at 4 °C . The pellets were resuspended in 10 ml lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 5 % glycerol , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 benzamidine and 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 DNase ) per litre of culture . The cells were subjected to cell disruption and further centrifugation using a Beckman rotor JA25 . 50 at 18 , 000 r . p . m . for 30 min at 4 °C . The soluble fractions were first purified using affinity chromatography with glutathione - sepharose and the GST tags were cleaved by thrombin while still bound to the column . The proteins were eluted in 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 5 % glycerol and 1 mM dithiothreitol , and then further polished using gel - filtration chromatography ( Superdex 75 , GE Healthcare ) in ITC buffer ( 50 mM HEPES pH 8 . 0 and 100 mM NaCl ) . The fractions corresponding to the respective proteins were then pooled and concentrated for ITC experiments or crystallization . ITC . All of the synthetic peptides used for the ITC experiments were purchased from Genscript . For the ITC experiments , the peptides were weighed and dissolved in ITC buffer to make a stock peptide concentration of 2 mM . The ITC experiments were performed at 25 °C on a MicroCal PEAQ - ITC instrument . The proteins were buffer exchanged into ITC buffer by gel filtration before the ITC experiments . Transmembrane cargo peptides at 750 μ M were titrated into 50 μ M PX domain samples . The binding data were processed using the MicroCal PEAQ - ITC analysis software with a single site - binding model to determine the stoichiometry ( n ) , binding constant ( K d ) , estimated heat of binding ( Δ H ) , Gibbs free energy ( Δ G ) and binding entropy ( Δ S ) . Three experiments were performed for each set of samples to determine the average ± s . e . m . for the thermodynamic quantities , except for the peptide mutations , SNX6 and SNX32 interaction experiments , where only single experiments were performed . For these single experiments , all experiments were performed using the same batch of protein to allow direct comparisons to be made . Protein crystallization and structure determination . The SeMet - labelled SNX5 – CI - MPR fusion protein was concentrated to 12 mg ml − 1 for crystallization . Four 96 - well crystallization hanging - drop screens were set up using a mosquito liquid handling robot ( TTP , LabTech ) at 20 °C in the UQ ROCX facility . After these 96 - well screens had been set up , the trays were incubated at 20 °C in a Rockimager storage hotel ( Formulatrix ) , where the drops were imaged at different time points for 21 d . Multiple hits were obtained and the best optimized conditions yielded two different crystal forms . Crystal form 1 ( spacegroup P2 1 2 1 2 1 ) was produced using 0 . 1 M MES pH 6 . 5 , 0 . 2 M ammonium sulphate , 30 % ( w / v ) PEG5000 MME , 15 % glycerol and 4 % ( v / v ) polypropylene glycol P400 . Crystal form 2 ( spacegroup C222 1 ) was produced using 0 . 1 M MES pH 6 . 5 , 0 . 2 M ammonium sulphate , 30 % ( w / v ) PEG5000 MME , 15 % glycerol and 3 % ( v / v ) ( ± ) - 2 - methyl - 2 , 4 - pentanediol . Both crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor plus 10 % glycerol before freezing in liquid nitrogen . Data were collected at the Australian Synchrotron MX2 Beamline , integrated with iMOSFLM 65 and scaled with AIMLESS 66 in the CCP4 suite 67 . The structures were initially solved by molecular replacement with PHASER 68 using the SNX5 – IncE crystal structure as the input model ( Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) accession code 5TGI ) 27 . The anomalous signals from the Se atoms were used to unambiguously assign the CI - MPR Met2372 side chain . The resulting models were rebuilt with COOT 69 , followed by repeated rounds of refinement with PHENIX 70 . The SNX5 – SEMA4C fusion protein was concentrated to 12 mg ml − 1 and crystals were grown in 25 % PEG3350 , 0 . 1 M Tris pH 8 . 0 , 20 mM ammonium sulphate and 10 mM barium chloride dihydrate , cryoprotected in 25 % glycerol and data were collected at the Australian Synchrotron MX1 Beamline . The structure was determined by molecular replacement using PHASER 68 and the resulting models were rebuilt with COOT 69 , followed by repeated rounds of refinement with PHENIX 70 . All structural figures were generated using PyMOL ( DeLano scientific ) . Genetics . The following Drosophila mutant alleles were used : slit 1 , robo 5 , snx1 ∆ 2 and snx5 / 6 ∆ . The following transgenes were used : UAS – Fra Δ C – HA and UAS – A5CD8 – GFP . The GAL4 driver used was eg - GAL4 . All crosses were carried out at 25 °C . Embryos were genotyped using balancer chromosomes carrying lacZ markers or by the presence of epitope - tagged transgenes . Drosophila embryo immunofluorescence and imaging . Dechorionated , formaldehyde - fixed , methanol - devitellinized embryos were fluorescently stained as previously described 39 . The following primary antibodies were used : mouse anti - 1D4 / FasII ( Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ; 1 : 100 ) , mouse anti - β - galactosidase ( Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ; 1 : 150 ) , rabbit anti - GFP ( Invitrogen , A11122 ; 1 : 500 ) and mouse anti - haemagglutinin ( Covance , 16B12 ; 1 : 250 ) . The following secondary antibodies were used : Alexa647 - conjugated goat anti - horseradish peroxidase ( Jackson Immunoresearch , 123 - 605 - 021 ; 1 : 500 ) , cyanine 3 - conjugated goat anti - mouse ( Jackson ; 1 : 1 , 000 ) and Alexa488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit ( Molecular Probes ; 1 : 500 ) . The embryos were mounted in 70 % glycerol in PBS . The phenotypes were analysed and images were acquired using a spinning disk confocal system ( PerkinElmer ) built on a Nikon Ti - U inverted microscope using a Nikon OFN25 × 60 , × 40 or × 10 objective with a Hamamatsu C10600 - 10B CCD camera and Yokogawa CSU - 10 scanner head with Volocity imaging software . The images were processed using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop software . Statistics and reproducibility . All of the quantified western - blot and confocal - colocalization data are the mean of at least three independent experiments . Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 7 ( GraphPad Software ) . The graphs represent the means and s . e . m . For all statistical tests , P < 0 . 05 was considered significant and is indicated by asterisks . Reporting Summary .

Sample size Sample size calculations were not preformed . All cell biology experiments were performed using at least 3 independent biological repeats . Analysis of cell - based phenotypes by confocal microscope was performed on in excess of 49 cells per experimental conditions . Quantification of Drosophila phenotypes was achieved from between 16 and 26 embryos ( exact numbers are defined in the appropriate Figure Legend ) . Data exclusions No data was excluded from any of the analyses reported in this study . Replication All experiments were performed using at least 3 independent biological repeats . All experiments shown were reproducible . For ITC experiments three experiments were performed for each set of samples to determine the average ± standard error of the mean ( SEM ) for thermodynamic quantities , except for the peptide mutations , SNX6 and SNX32 interaction experiments where only single experiments were performed . For these single experiments , all experiments were performed using the same batch of protein to allow direct comparisons to be made . Randomization Experimental groups were assembled such that controls and positive / negative experimental conditions were generated , processed and analysed in parallel . For examples , the data shown in Figure 4D were collected from the same experimental group . Blinding Blinding was not used in this study . Reporting for specific materials , systems and methods We require information from authors about some types of materials , experimental systems and methods used in many studies .

Validation Besides the technical validation from the manufacturers we independently validated the key antibodies used in this study namely those against SNX1 , SNX2 , SNX5 , SNX6 , CI - MPR and IGF1 - R antibodies . This validation was achieved through comparative and quantitative western analysis and immunofluorescent analysis of wild - type and CRISPR Cas9 gene - edited cells targeting the corresponding protein . For the other antibodies validation was either through the manufacturers validation sheet ( see detailed information above for the precise manufacturer and individual antibody ID ) or published validation by other research groups ( see reference list associated with the manuscript ) . Eukaryotic cell lines Policy information about cell lines Cell line source ( s ) HeLa , HEK - 293T and RPE1 cell lines were originally sourced from ATCC . Authentication Authentication was from the ATCC . We have not independently authenticated the cell lines . Mycoplasma contamination The parental HeLa cells used for generation of all CRISPR edit cell lines were mycoplasma tested , which revealed no contamination . Our HEK - 293T cell line has also been negatively tested for mycoplasma contamination . Commonly misidentified lines ( See ICLAC register ) No commonly misidentified cell lines were used . Animals and other organisms Policy information about studies involving animals ; ARRIVE guidelines recommended for reporting animal research Laboratory animals No laboratory animals were used in this study . Wild animals This study did not use wild animals . Field - collected samples This study did not use field - collected samples . Ethics oversight No ethical approval or guidance was required for this study as it did not involve the use of animals or human tissue samples .
