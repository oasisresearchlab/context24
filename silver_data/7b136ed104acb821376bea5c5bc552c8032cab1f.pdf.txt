ABSTRACT Virtual Reality ( VR ) environments are promising creativity support tools that can be designed to enhance factors related to the creative process such as immersion , engagement , and flow . However , it is still unclear how brain responses associated with creativity are influenced by VR . To address this gap , we collected EEG signals from 21 participants during a creative idea generation task in two conditions ; 2D Screen vs . 3D VR . The EEG power in the alpha ( 8 - 13 Hz ) , beta ( 13 - 30 Hz ) , and gamma ( 30 - 45 Hz ) frequency bands were compared . The results showed that participants experienced higher enjoyment , immersion , and temporal dissociation in the 3D VR condition . Additionally , a significant increase of oscillations in the high - frequency bands of beta and gamma was observed in VR . The findings suggest that VR can induce a more pronounced sense of flow that is associated with distinct brain activation patterns .

Due to its fundamental role in innovation , it directly impacts scientific , eco - nomic , and social domains [ 15 ] . Such creativity is necessary when no apparent satisfactory solution to a problem is in view . Here , the generation of original ideas is needed to break free from an existing sub - optimal situation , in favor of a potentially better one . Emerging technologies can enable new ways in which creative idea genera - tion is facilitated and enhanced , and the development of such digital creativity support tools has been hailed as a ‚Äôgrand challenge‚Äô in the field of human - computer interaction [ 25 ] . One technology that offers a particularly promising platform for supporting creative idea generation is Virtual Reality ( VR ) [ 15 , 18 , 27 , 32 ] . VR is an artificial 3D simulation of an environment and is be - lieved to engage cognitive processes similar to how people expe - rience the real world [ 16 ] . The potential of VR systems has been CHI EA ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Laura Josephine Hagedorn , Alwin de Rooij , and Maryam Alimardani investigated in various fields such as education [ 10 , 23 ] , training [ 22 , 36 ] , and entertainment [ 10 , 24 ] . However , relatively little is known about how VR can be used to support creative idea genera - tion [ 15 , 35 ] . One study by [ 18 ] suggests that the flexibility of VR for creating environments that are not constrained by real - world phys - ical limitations enables new forms of creative expression . Others have suggested that VR can also support creative idea generation because of its effect on the flow experience [ 20 ] , which subsumes concepts such as immersion [ 21 ] , enjoyment , and distorted time perception [ 29 ] . Specifically , [ 35 ] showed how designing wearable products in VR , compared to using pen - and - paper , induced more flow and resulted in more creative ideas . Similarly , [ 32 ] showed that receiving design instructions in VR , rather than during a lecture , could better support creative idea generation due to its positive effect on immersion . A currently understudied use of VR for supporting creativity is its potential for allowing the user to " be in " and " explore " an envi - ronment that otherwise would not be accessible [ 32 ] . For example , when generating creative ideas to save Venice from tourism , it can be useful to explore Venice itself , which might not be a viable option in real - life . VR can thus facilitate the production of creative ideas for solving problems that are bound to the physical environment . This often requires sensory exploration and integration of infor - mation from the surroundings to generate and evaluate new ideas [ 27 , 32 ] . The immersive feature of VR enables the user to search for new information in the environment [ 26 ] while experiencing an effective sensory - motor coupling enhanced by the experience of flow , especially when compared to more traditional digital tools such as 2D screens [ 35 ] . To effectively support creative idea generation through VR , it is crucial to monitor users‚Äô performance and mental states , such that VR - based interventions can be designed to provide nudges and help people to maintain a state that optimally supports their creative thinking . The first step in the development of such closed - loop VR systems is to investigate the potential of an objective measure - ment that can be tracked in real - time . Currently , assessments of creative idea generation are often conducted through self - reports or ratings by domain experts , and both measurements are highly subjective and only possible after the completion of the task [ 4 ] . An alternative approach is to record brain activity during creative tasks to examine underlying neurophysiological indicators of cre - ative idea generation [ 6 , 13 , 30 ] . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) is a particularly suitable measure for this purpose due to its high temporal resolution [ 30 ] as well as its accessibility and potential to be combined with VR . While several studies have previously investigated the neural mechanisms of creative idea generation [ 6 , 13 , 30 ] , very few have done this in combination with immersive VR environments . These studies often reported a positive correlation between alpha band activity ( 8 - 13 Hz ) and creative task performance [ 13 , 30 ] . How - ever , more recent studies employing EEG during creative tasks that demand externally oriented attention rather than internal focus , report brain activity changes in higher frequency ranges such as beta ( 13 - 30 Hz ) and gamma ( 30 - 45 Hz ) frequency bands [ 30 , 32 ] . Therefore , this study aimed to identify the brain activity compo - nents that are affected by creativity support tools such as immersive VR , which facilitate visual exploration of a simulated environment . We recorded the EEG brain activity of 21 individuals who worked on a creative idea generation task while interacting with a 360 ‚ó¶ virtual environment under two levels of immersion : when the envi - ronment was presented on a 2D Screen vs . when the subject viewed it in 3D using a VR head - mounted display . Using this approach , we aimed to answer the following research question : RQ : Is there a difference in alpha , beta , and gamma brain activity when people engage in creative idea generation in a virtual environment presented in 3D VR compared to a 2D screen ? 2 METHODS 2 . 1 Participants Twenty - one university students ( 15 females , 6 males , ùëÄ ùëéùëîùëí = 20 . 35 , ùëÜùê∑ ùëéùëîùëí = 2 . 34 ) participated in this study . All participants reported no or very little experience with VR . They received information about the study and consequently signed an informed consent form in accordance with the guidelines of the Research Ethics and Data Management Committee of Tilburg University . 2 . 2 EEG recording Brain activity was measured using the g . Nautilus EEG equipment ( g . tec Medical Engineering , Austria ) . The EEG signals were recorded via 16 electrodes according to the international 10 ‚Äì 20 system ( Fig - ure 2 ) . In this paper , we only report the measurements from the frontal brain area ( i . e . , F3 and F4 electrodes , shaded red in Figure 2 ) . The recording sampling rate was 250 samples per second . To minimize noise , a 48 - 52 Hz Notch filter was applied . Figure 2 : EEG brain activity was recorded by 16 electrodes distributed across the scalp . In this paper , the signals from the frontal electrodes F3 and F4 were analyzed . 2 . 3 Conditions In this study , the experiments were conducted using a within - subjects design , where participants experienced two experimental conditions in a counterbalanced order . 2D Screen Condition . In the Screen condition , participants sat in front of a 27 - inch monitor with a 1920 √ó 1080 resolution ( Full HD ) and interacted with a 360 ‚ó¶ video displayed on the screen . Virtual Reality and Creativity : How do Immersive Environments Stimulate the Brain during Creative Idea Generation ? CHI EA ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Figure 3 : The experiment protocol . The participants were able to change perspective and navigate the scene using a computer mouse but were not able to move or change their location in the video . Before the task started , EEG signals were collected in a baseline phase , in which participants watched a fixation cross on the screen . 3D VR condition . In the VR condition , participants wore a VR head - mounted display ( Oculus Quest ) and watched a 360 ‚ó¶ video ( a different video than the other condition , also counterbalanced ) in the 3D environment . Again , the participants were not able to change their location within the 3D environment but could move their head to look around and see the environment from different perspectives . Before the task , the same fixation cross as in the 2D screen condition was shown in the VR environment to record the baseline EEG while subjects were wearing the VR headset . This was to offset any potential noise that might have been registered in the recordings due to the placement of the headset . In the past , the effect of immersive VR was compared to a non - immersive pen - and - paper control condition [ 32 ] . However , in this study , we were interested in the effect of technology type as a creativity support tool . The 360 ‚ó¶ videos used in the 2D Screen condition were the same as the ones used for the 3D VR condition . Therefore , by comparing the 2D and 3D conditions , we intended to increase the reliability of measuring the effect of VR immersion on creative idea generation . 2 . 4 Creative idea generation task A common approach to test creative idea generation is to present participants with a problem statement and to ask them to generate as many creative ideas that might help solve the problem as they can [ 6 , 30 ] . The task used in this study started with a problem state - ment that was presented verbally and was related to the observable scenery in each condition . Subjects received time to generate cre - ative ideas in response to the problem statement while exploring the environment . Two problem statements were prepared for this research both re - lated to climate change issues . According to [ 7 ] , creativity requires a certain level of knowledge on a specific topic . Because of this , we chose a topic that we assumed participants were more or less equally informed about . Scenario 1 : In the first scenario , participants were shown a first - person view of a forest . The problem statement described that the forest is situated in the middle of two villages that want to engage in trade . The participant was asked to come up with ideas that enabled transport between the villages without destroying the forest . Scenario 2 : In the second scenario , participants were shown a first - person view of an island . It was stated that a rare species of lizards are living on this island , but that they are endangered by the rising sea levels . The participant was asked to come up with ideas for saving the lizards from going extinct . While choosing the two 360 ‚ó¶ videos 1 for this experiment , we mainly focused on visual content that included sufficient stimuli to enhance the creative thinking processes without overstimulating the participant through excessive movement or distracting informa - tion that is irrelevant to the problem statement ( e . g . , a forest with several trees and bushes in minimal movement , but no humans or animals . ) 2 . 5 Procedure Before the study , each participant received an information letter that held information about the general setup of the experiment . After signing the informed consent form , they provided their demo - graphic information . Next , they were seated in a comfortable chair in front of a computer screen to be prepared for EEG recording . the experimenter positioned the EEG cap on the participant‚Äôs head and applied conductive gel to improve the quality of signals . 1 Both videos were downloaded from https : / / www . storyblocks . com / .

CHI EA ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Laura Josephine Hagedorn , Alwin de Rooij , and Maryam Alimardani The experiment started with one of the two conditions ( 2D Screen or 3D VR ) in a counterbalanced order . Each condition en - tailed 3 phases : 1 ) a familiarization phase in which participants explored the environment before the task to inhibit the novelty effect , 2 ) an EEG baseline recording ( 2 - min ) gathering each individ - ual‚Äôs brain signals in the resting state before the task , and 3 ) the creative idea generation task , in which participants were asked to come up with creative ideas that help solve the stated problem . To reduce EEG artifacts generated by jaw movement , participants were instructed to hold ideas in their memory until they were signaled to report them . Each condition was segmented into 3 idea generation phases and 3 report phases ( Figure 3 ) . During the report phases , participants could " unload " their memory without disturbing the EEG recording . The reporting of ideas took place in 3 intervals of 20 seconds . The idea generation phases took place in three uneven parts lasting 30 , 60 , and 90 seconds , respectively . Therefore , the task in each condition lasted 4 minutes , consisting of a total of 3 minutes of creative idea generation and a total of 1 minute of idea reporting . These intervals were chosen based on several considerations . For instance , it has been shown that as participants iterate ideas in divergent thinking tasks , the originality of their ideas increases over time [ 3 ] . Besides that , it has been shown that time pressure can negatively affect creative idea generation [ 3 ] . Finally , the exact amount of seconds most appropriate for the segments was deter - mined through pilot testing 2 . After each condition , the participants were instructed to fill in a questionnaire about their experience . 2 . 6 Evaluation and Analysis To evaluate the impact of immersive environments on creative idea generation , we compared the two conditions ( 3D VR vs . 2D Screen ) using subjective and objective measures . For subjective measures , we obtained participants‚Äô scores on Temporal dissocia - tion , Immersion , and Enjoyment following [ 1 ] . Immersion refers to the experience of total engagement in the task and was measured using 4 items . Enjoyment refers to the pleasurable aspects of the interaction and was measured using 5 items . Temporal dissociation , which entailed 5 items , refers to distorted time perception and the inability to register the passage of time , i . e . , how fast time flew during the interaction . The item scores were aggregated per con - struct and compared between conditions . After the data distribution was checked for normality using the Shapiro - Wilk test , a paired t - test was applied to examine whether the scores on Temporal dis - sociation , Immersion , and Enjoyment were significantly different between the two conditions . In addition to this , Cohen‚Äôs d was used to measure the effect sizes . The analysis was performed in R . As for the objective measurement , we compared the neural re - sponses of participants between the two conditions . Following the literature on the neuroscience of creativity [ 30 , 32 ] , we were par - ticularly interested in EEG signal power changes in the frontal area of the brain in the frequency bands of alpha ( 8 - 13 Hz ) , beta ( 13 - 30 Hz ) , and gamma ( 30 - 45 Hz ) when participants engaged in the idea generation task using either 3D VR or 2D screen . The recorded EEG signals were first pre - processed using a bandpass 2 Subjects that participated in these tests did not participate in the experiment . filter and Independent Component Analysis ( ICA ) to clean the data from artifacts and eye blinking . Next , the two frontal electrodes F3 and F4 were selected and the time series from these two chan - nels were segmented in each condition to acquire the " pre - task baseline " and the " creative task " epochs . The signal power in the target frequency bands was calculated separately for baseline and task epochs using the spectopo function from EEGLAB [ 12 ] . Then , for each participant in each condition , the EEG band powers in the baseline were subtracted from the corresponding power in the task phase . This baseline - correction approach was implemented to address the inherent individual differences in the EEG signals and hence obtain the task - induced changes in the dependent vari - ables for each subject separately . This approach eventually created 3 frequency band power values ( alpha , beta , gamma ) , per electrode ( F3 and F4 ) , per condition ( 3D VR vs . 2D Screen ) , and per subject . The values were then compared between 2D Screen and 3D VR conditions for each frequency band at each EEG site ( i . e . , electrode ) separately . Since the obtained data did not follow a normal distri - bution , a paired Wilcoxon signed - rank test was applied . Also , since the comparison of band powers was repeated two times for the selected EEG channels ( repeated measures ) , the adjusted p - value for significance was set at . 05 / 2 = . 025 . 3 RESULTS 3 . 1 Questionnaire Figure 4 displays the distribution of questionnaire scores in the two conditions . The paired t - test showed that participants experienced a significantly higher Temporal dissociation ( t ( 20 ) = 4 . 9314 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 1585 ) , Immersion ( t ( 20 ) = 5 . 6934 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 3662 ) , and Enjoyment ( t ( 30 ) = 5 . 5247 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 3103 ) during the 3D VR condition than during the 2D Screen condition . Figure 4 : Questionnaire outcomes . Subjects reported signifi - cantly higher Temporal dissociation , Immersion , and Enjoy - ment when performing the idea generation task in 3D VR compared to the 2D Screen ( * * * * p < . 0001 ) . Virtual Reality and Creativity : How do Immersive Environments Stimulate the Brain during Creative Idea Generation ? CHI EA ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany 3 . 2 EEG data The distribution of the EEG frequency band power changes ( from resting - state baseline ) in the frontal brain region is demonstrated in Figure 5 . The paired Wilcoxon signed - rank test showed a significant difference in beta and gamma band activity between conditions in both F3 and F4 electrodes . When subjects performed the idea generation task in the 3D VR condition , there was a significant increase of beta ( V = 31 , p = . 0022 ) and gamma activity ( V = 20 , p = . 00035 ) in F3 as well as in F4 , where beta ( V = 29 , p = . 0016 ) and gamma ( V = 8 , p = . 00002 ) band power increased significantly compared to the 2D screen condition . The power changes in the alpha band were not significant in F3 ( p = . 029 ) , nor in F4 ( p = . 502 ) at the adjusted significance level of . 025 according to the Bonferroni correction [ 33 ] . Figure 5 : Distribution of EEG band powers . There was a sig - nificant increase of beta and gamma band activity ( compared to baseline ) in both F3 and F4 electrode locations when sub - jects completed the idea generation task in 3D VR compared to when they used 2D Screen ( * * p < . 01 , * * * p < . 001 , * * * * p < . 0001 ) . 4 DISCUSSION This research aimed to investigate the difference in brain activity when people performed a creative idea generation task in problem - related immersive virtual environments . EEG brain activity was recorded from 21 participants who generated creative ideas for a problem related to environmental preservation . During the task , participants could watch an immersive video of the environment related to the problem ( e . g . , a forest ) using either a 3D VR headset or a 2D computer screen . The results showed that participants expe - rienced significantly greater feelings of immersion , enjoyment , and time distortion , with a large effect size , when completing the task in the 3D VR condition than in the 2D screen condition . Addition - ally , the analysis of the EEG data showed significant increases in frontal beta and gamma band activity in the 3D VR condition . These findings suggest that VR can induce a more pronounced sense of flow with distinct brain activation patterns that are associated with heightened attention and sensory processing . These results are consistent with observations of [ 32 ] who also reported increased beta and gamma band activity in the subject group that received VR - based design instruction compared to the group that experienced lecture - based design training . Beta and gamma frequency bands represent fast brain responses that are generally associated with a state of alertness , outward attention , and high - level information processing [ 30 ] . Unlike alpha band ac - tivity that has been extensively reported as a common marker of creative thinking [ 13 , 30 ] , the correlation of beta and gamma fre - quency band increases with creative thinking is less commonly found . This is perhaps because most tasks designed to test creative idea generation in past studies draw strongly on internal cogni - tion , e . g . , memory search and mental imagery , to form relevant and coherent ideas . This contrasts with creative drawing or problem - solving tasks that are bound to the external environment , and rely on actively searching the environment to support idea generation . The high - speed neural processing in the gamma frequency band is considered a reflection of sensory processes and integration of information into conscious awareness [ 30 ] , which are both relevant for such creative idea generation . Additionally , increased activity in the gamma band has been associated with the state of flow [ 2 ] and aha ! moments [ 9 ] . This suggests that perceptually richer environ - ments such as VR can facilitate idea generation through attentional and multi - sensory integration processes that help the user to be " in the zone‚Äù . The findings of brain activity changes are complemented by the subjective reports , which revealed a significant difference in immersion , enjoyment , and temporal dissociation in the 3D VR condition . Feeling immersed is a central characteristic of a VR system , and the results show that the participants felt significantly more immersed in the 3D VR condition than in the 2D screen condition , which is in line with prior research [ 5 , 17 ] . Previous work suggests that immersive VR can positively impact the users‚Äô motivation , engagement [ 34 ] , and enjoyment [ 21 ] , which are factors known to have a positive effect on creative idea generation [ 8 ] . Time distortion , i . e . , the feeling of time flying , is seen as a characteristic of the flow state [ 11 , 29 ] and is closely linked to heightened enjoyment [ 29 ] . Indeed , all participants reported their experience in 3D VR as significantly more enjoyable than in the 2D Screen condition . But note that this could also relate to the novelty effect . It has been established in previous HCI literature that the interac - tion environment is an essential factor for creativity support tools [ 26 ] . Creative activities rely on motivation , knowledge resources , social interaction , and exploration of new media technologies [ 14 ] . Virtual reality offers a rich 3D immersive experience where users can freely brainstorm , visualize ideas and develop prototypes in a cost - effective manner [ 15 ] . Moreover , the context and design of the virtual environment is another key factor that can be used to support creativity [ 26 ] . VR represents a ‚Äúsafe space‚Äù , where individ - uals can make mistakes and therefore explore their ideas without consequences [ 26 ] . It can also be designed to provide clues ( i . e . , additional pieces of information ) and nudges to support creative idea generation [ 15 ] . By monitoring the brain activity of users in real time , it is possible to provide these clues and nudges in a more CHI EA ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Laura Josephine Hagedorn , Alwin de Rooij , and Maryam Alimardani timely fashion that would activate internal representations and stimulate creativity . In sum , this study contributes novel insights into the neural cor - relates of creative idea generation . It also demonstrates that using an immersive VR environment as a support tool for creative idea generation tasks could significantly enhance the user‚Äôs experience of immersion , flow , and enjoyment , which are all factors that have been associated with creative thinking in prior research . In this study , however , we did not examine the relationship between these enhanced factors , brain activity , and subjects‚Äô creative performance . In future research , we aim to employ subjective and objective met - rics ( such as expert ratings or analysis of semantic distance [ 19 ] ) to evaluate the quality of the generated creative ideas and estab - lish the relationships between brain activity patterns and creative thinking performance . More research is required to further address contradicting findings in past research , particularly the role of alpha band activity , in different creativity tasks supported by digital tools [ 13 , 30 , 31 ] . 5 CONCLUSION In this study , we investigated the effectiveness of immersive VR environments for supporting creative idea generation using sub - jective self - reports and objective measures of brain activity . The results showed that the participants felt more immersed and expe - rienced greater time distortion and enjoyment when they worked on a problem - based idea generation task in a 3D VR environment compared to a 2D computer screen . Additionally , the analysis of the EEG brain signals revealed a significant increase in frontal beta and gamma oscillations during the 3D VR condition , which have been associated with enhanced sensory processing and information integration in the previous neuroscience literature . To conclude , VR systems hold potential for enhancing creative idea generation as they offer immersive environments that promote the experience of flow . Using real - time measures of brain activity , it is possible to develop VR creativity support tools that monitor a user‚Äôs mental state and provide timely cues and nudges that stimulate creativity . 6 APPENDIX Previews of the videos that have been used for the experiment can be found at the following links : Scenario 1 : https : / / www . storyblocks . com / video / stock / 360vr - video - of - an - incline - in - a - forest - on - a - sunny - day - bfxhssjgrjxogo 4hjScenario 2 : https : / / www . storyblocks . com / video / stock / 360 - vr - video - waterscape - and - landscape - of - mauritius - ocean - shallow - water - and - black - rocks - on - the - coast - clouds - sailing - over - the - island - rujhglr3xj0qdlz57 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS In loving memory of my father , Georg Hagedorn , who introduced me to the world of ( computer ) science and always encouraged and inspired me through his natural skepticism and unique sense of humor .
