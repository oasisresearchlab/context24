Many cellular Ca 2 + - stimulated signalling cascades utilise the intermediate , calmodulin ( CaM ) . The Ca 2 + / CaM complex binds and activates a variety of enzymes , including members of the multifunctional Ca 2 + / calmodulin - stimulated protein kinase ( CaMK ) family . These enzymes control a broad range of cancer - related functions in a multitude of tumour types . Herein , we explore the cancer - related functions of these kinases and discuss their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention . Keywords : CaMKK ; CaMKI ; CaMKII ; CaMKIV ; anti - cancer drugs 1 . Introduction Ca 2 + is a major second messenger in cells and is essential for a variety of important signalling pathways . Alterations in intracellular Ca 2 + signalling regulate many biological processes , including gene transcription , exocytosis , the cell cycle , migration and apoptosis . Cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentrations rise in response to a variety of stimuli , which activate Ca 2 + - channels in the plasma membrane , or by release from intracellular stores . It is increasingly being realised that disruption of normal Ca 2 + signalling contributes to the development of tumourigenic phenotypes [ 1 ] , and aberrant Ca 2 + signalling has been implicated in each of the hallmarks of cancer originally identiﬁed by Hanahan and Weinberg [ 2 ] . Ca 2 + signals in the form of spikes or oscillations and is tightly regulated . The decoding of this is achieved by several downstream effectors , including calmodulin ( CaM ) . Binding of Ca 2 + dramatically changes the conformation of CaM and increases its afﬁnity for a large number of CaM - binding proteins , including the multifunctional CaM kinases ( CaMKK , CaMKI , CaMKII and CaMKIV ) . These multifunctional kinases are widely expressed and control a variety of cancer related functions in a range of cancer types . Their potential as targets for anti - cancer therapeutic intervention have recently begun to be appreciated . 2 . Structure and Regulation of Calcium / Calmodulin - Stimulated Protein Kinase ( CAMK ) Family Members 2 . 1 . CaMKK Ca 2 + / calmodulin stimulated protein kinase kinase ( CaMKK ) is a multifunctional protein kinase encoded by two genes ( CAMKK1 and CAMKK2 ) that produce CaMKK α or CaMKK β [ 3 ] , respectively . The CAMKK2 gene produces several splicing isoforms depending on cell type [ 4 , 5 ] . CaMKK α was Pharmaceuticals 2019 , 12 , 8 ; doi : 10 . 3390 / ph12010008 www . mdpi . com / journal / pharmaceuticals Pharmaceuticals 2019 , 12 , 8 2 of 29 originally identiﬁed in rat brain as an activating kinase for CaMKIV [ 6 ] and CaMKI [ 7 ] , and an additional β isoform was later identiﬁed [ 8 ] . CaMKK is primarily expressed in the brain , including the olfactory bulb , hypothalamus , hippocampus , dentate gyrus , cerebellum and amygdala , and at low levels in peripheral tissues ( such as the thymus , spleen , lung , and testis ) [ 9 – 11 ] . CaMKK phosphorylates CaMKI and CaMKIV [ 3 , 11 ] , AMP activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) [ 12 ] and protein kinase B ( PKB / Akt ) [ 13 ] . CaMKK , CaMKI and CaMKIV form a signalling pathway termed the Ca 2 + / CaM - dependent kinase cascade , which has been implicated in several cellular processes , including regulating dendritic spine morphology , hematopoietic stem cell maintenance , cell proliferation , apoptosis , glucose uptake , adipogenesis , and normal immune cell function [ 14 – 21 ] . Although CaMKK α and CaMKK β share high sequence homology ( Figure 1 ) and possess a common domain structure , with a catalytic domain adjacent to an autoregulatory domain containing an autoinhibitory region that overlaps with the CaM - binding region , they differ in their biochemical properties . Whilst CaMKK α requires Ca 2 + / CaM to relieve the autoinhibitory mechanism [ 22 ] , CaMKK β exhibits partially autonomous activity in the absence of Ca 2 + / CaM [ 8 , 11 ] , which is regulated by phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 β ( GSK3 β ) and cyclin - dependent kinase 5 ( CDK5 ) [ 23 ] . CDK5 phosphorylates CaMKK β at S137 , thereby priming CaMKK β for phosphorylation by GSK - 3 β at S129 and S133 [ 23 ] . Both CaMKK isoforms are partly inhibited following cAMP - dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) phosphorylation [ 24 , 25 ] , and PKA can phosphorylate CaMKK α on S52 , S74 , T108 , S458 , and S475 [ 25 ] , and CaMKK β on S100 , S495 and S511 [ 10 ] . The major site of autophosphorylation of CaMKK α is S24 [ 25 ] , and for CaMKK β is T482 [ 26 ] . T482 generates partial autonomous activity , which results in partial disruption of the autoinhibitory mechanism [ 26 ] . As CaMKK β is not dependent on rapid ﬂuxes in intracellular Ca 2 + for basal activity , it can respond to other stimuli of longer duration and can phosphorylate AMPK . 1 Figure 1 . Schematic representing the domain structure of CaMKK . There are two CaMKK isoforms— CaMKK α and CaMKK β . CaMKK consists of a unique N - terminal domain ( grey ) , a catalytic domain ( red ) which contains an ATP binding region , and a regulatory domain ( blue ) containing overlapping autoinhibitory and calmodulin ( CaM ) binding regions . Phosphorylation sites are indicated by green balls , with protein kinase A ( PKA ) phosphorylation sites indicated with red arrows . Binding of Ca 2 + / CaM to CaMKK α prevents phosphorylation at S52 , S74 , T108 , and S458 , but enhances phosphorylation at S475 [ 25 ] . Additionally , phosphorylation of CaMKK α on S74 , T108 and S458 negatively regulates activity [ 24 , 27 , 28 ] and phosphorylation of S458 blocks Ca 2 + / CaM binding . Pharmaceuticals 2019 , 12 , 8 3 of 29 2 . 2 . CaMKI The Ca 2 + / calmodulin - stimulated protein kinase I ( CaMKI ) family is composed of four members , which are coded for by four different genes : CAMK1 , PNCK , CAMK1G and CAMK1D , which produce CaMKI α , CaMKI β / Pnck , CaMKI γ / CLICK3 , or CaMKI δ / CKLiK , respectively . The PNCK gene produces several splicing isoforms depending on cell type and developmental stage [ 29 ] . The various isoforms of CaMKI are ubiquitously expressed at low levels [ 30 ] , and expressed at high levels in several brain regions , including the cortex , hippocampus , thalamus , hypothalamus , midbrain , and olfactory bulb , with each isoform exhibiting distinct spatiotemporal expression during neuronal development [ 31 , 32 ] . CaMKI has been implicated in the control of a variety of cellular functions , including long term potentiation , the control of synapsin in nerve terminals , axon / dendritic outgrowth and growth cone motility , aldosterone synthase expression , osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption and proliferation [ 32 – 39 ] . Similar to CaMKK , the four CaMKI isoforms share a common domain structure ( Figure 2 ) , with a catalytic domain adjacent to an autoregulatory domain containing an autoinhibitory region that overlaps with the CaM - binding region . Binding of Ca 2 + / CaM to CaMKI causes a conformational change that relieves the autoinhibition and allows phosphorylation by CaMKK ( T174 for CaMKI α ) , which is required for maximal CaMKI activity [ 40 , 41 ] . Additionally , once CaMKI δ is phosphorylated by CaMKK , it becomes resistant to protein phosphatases , which induces a ‘primed’ state , where it can more readily be activated in response to Ca 2 + signals than other CaMKI enzymes [ 42 ] . 1 Figure 2 . Schematic representing the domain structure of the CaMKI family . There are four CaMKI isoforms—CaMKI α , CaMKI β , CaMKI γ , and CaMKI δ , with each isoform sharing a similar structure . CaMKI consists of a unique N - terminal domain ( grey ) , adjacent to a catalytic domain ( red ) which contains an ATP binding region , and a regulatory domain ( blue ) containing overlapping autoinhibitory and calmodulin ( CaM ) binding regions . Phosphorylation sites are indicated by green balls . 2 . 3 . CaMKII The Ca 2 + / calmodulin - stimulated protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) family is encoded by four genes : CAMK2A , CAMK2B , CAMK2G , CAMK2D , which produce CaMKII α , CaMKII β , CaMKII γ , and CaMKII δ , respectively . Alternative splicing within the variable linker - region produces multiple Pharmaceuticals 2019 , 12 , 8 4 of 29 isoforms [ 43 ] . One or more members of the CaMKII family are found in every tissue . CaMKII α and CaMKII β are most highly expressed in neurons and are involved in regulating a variety of neuronal functions , including neurotransmitter synthesis and release , neurite extension , and synaptic plasticity that underlies learning and memory [ 44 – 48 ] . CaMKII has also been implicated in the regulation of non - neuronal processes , including fertilisation , the maintenance of vascular tone , osteogenic differentiation , normal cardiac function , apoptosis and excitotoxicity / ischaemic - induced cell death and cell proliferation [ 34 , 49 – 56 ] . Similar to the other CaMK family members , CaMKII subunits ( Figure 3 ) have an N - terminal catalytic domain , and a regulatory domain ( which contains autoinhibitory and CaM binding domains ) . In contrast to the other CaMK family members , CaMKII possesses a C - terminal association domain and associates into a multimeric form [ 57 ] . The crystalline structure of CaMKII α shows that it consists of two autoinhibited catalytic domains in a symmetric dimer . The regulatory domain is joined to the C - terminus of the catalytic domain [ 57 ] , which functions as a gate ( with T286 as its hinge ) , so that it blocks the protein substrate and adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) binding sites when CaMKII is autoinhibited and is ‘open’ following autophosphorylation at T286 . CaMKII is therefore comprised of six mutually inhibited dimers . 2 Figure 3 . Schematic representing the domain structure of the CaMKII family . There are four CaMKII isoforms—CaMKII α , CaMKII β , CaMKII γ , and CaMKII δ , with each isoform sharing a similar structure . CaMKII consists of a unique N - terminal domain ( grey ) , adjacent to a catalytic domain ( red ) which contains an ATP binding region , and a regulatory domain ( blue ) containing overlapping autoinhibitory and calmodulin ( CaM ) binding regions . Phosphorylation sites are indicated by green balls . All isoforms also contain a C - terminal association domain ( brown ) , which is involved in the formation of CaMKII multimers . CaMKII requires Ca 2 + / CaM for initial enzyme activity . Binding of CaM molecules to adjacent subunits within a holoenzyme allows autophosphorylation at T826 of one or both of these subunits to occur [ 58 ] . Autophosphorylation of T286 in CaMKII α ( T287 in CaMKII β , γ , and δ ) occurs rapidly and alters the afﬁnity for Ca 2 + / CaM and enzyme activity [ 59 , 60 ] . CaMKII phosphorylation at T286 generates an autonomously active kinase that remains active even following CaM dissociation . Phosphorylation at T286 can also regulate the function of CaMKII by altering its binding to speciﬁc subcellular locations [ 61 – 63 ] . Once CaMKII is Ca 2 + - independent , and Ca 2 + / CaM is no longer bound , Pharmaceuticals 2019 , 12 , 8 5 of 29 secondary sites within the CaM - binding site can be phosphorylated ( T305 / 306 in CaMKII α , and T306 / 307 in CaMKII β , γ , and δ ) [ 64 , 65 ] . Phosphorylation at these sites prevents CaM binding and CaMKII subsequently becomes insensitive to changes in Ca 2 + / CaM [ 66 ] . Other forms of post - translational modiﬁcation have also been demonstrated to alter CaMKII activity . Speciﬁcally , a pair of methionine residues ( M281 / 282 ) , present in the β , γ , and δ , but not α , isoforms [ 67 ] , can become oxidised and produce a conformational change in CaMKII , similar to that produced following T286 phosphorylation , leading to an autonomous activation of CaMKII [ 68 ] . However , not all CaMKII phosphorylation sites modulate Ca 2 + / CaM binding and kinase activity . Phosphorylation at several sites that have no direct effect on kinase activity , but alter molecular targeting , have been identiﬁed in vivo , including T253 , S279 and S314 [ 69 – 72 ] . 2 . 4 . CaMKIV Ca 2 + / calmodulin - stimulated protein kinase IV ( CaMKIV ) is encoded by the CAMK4 gene . Two different isoforms ( CaMKIV α and CaMKIV β ) are produced by alternative processing [ 73 , 74 ] . The CaMKIV expression pattern is similar to that of CaMKK β , with both primarily being expressed in the brain , however , CaMKIV is also present in immune cells , the testes and ovaries [ 9 , 16 , 75 , 76 ] . It is particularly enriched in cerebellar granule cells , and subsequently , has previously been referred to as CaMK - Gr . The CAMK4 gene also encodes calspermin , a Ca 2 + / CaM binding protein of unknown function that is exclusively expressed in spermatids in the testes [ 76 ] . CaMKIV has been implicated in the regulation of homeostatic plasticity , neurite outgrowth , fear memory , immune and inﬂammatory responses , the regulation of cyclic AMP element binding protein ( CREB ) and cell proliferation [ 34 , 77 – 81 ] . CaMKIV β is identical to CaMKIV α , except for the addition of 28 amino acids at the N - terminus . Similar to the other CaMK family members , CaMKIV has a catalytic domain adjacent to an autoregulatory domain containing an autoinhibitory region that overlaps with the CaM - binding region ( Figure 4 ) . CaMKIV requires Ca 2 + / CaM to become active , as well as phosphorylation of the conserved T in the activation loop ( T200 in human CaMKIV and T196 in the rat enzyme ) by CaMKK [ 82 ] , which generates an autonomously active kinase . Following this , CaMKIV then autophosphorylates at S12 and S13 , which enable Ca 2 + / CaM independent activity . Double S11A / S12A phospho - null mutants lack Ca 2 + / CaM - dependent basal activity and are unresponsive to CaMKK [ 83 ] , indicating that S12 and S13 mediate an intrasteric inhibition , and are essential for full activation of CaMKIV . Similar to T305 / 6 in CaMKII , phosphorylation of CaMKIV within the CaM binding region ( S336 in human CaMKIV and S332 in the rat enzyme ) prevents CaM binding and inactivates CaMKIV [ 84 ] . 2 Figure 4 . Schematic representing the domain structure of the CaMKIV family . The two CaMKIV isoforms—CaMKIV α and CaMKII β differ only at their N - terminus . CaMKIV consists of a unique N - terminal domain ( grey ) , adjacent to a catalytic domain ( red ) which contains an ATP binding region , and a regulatory domain ( blue ) containing overlapping autoinhibitory and calmodulin ( CaM ) binding regions . Phosphorylation sites are indicated ( green balls ) . Pharmaceuticals 2019 , 12 , 8 6 of 29 3 . The Role of CaMK Family Members in Cancer Due to their role as mediators of Ca 2 + - signalling , it is not surprising that the CaMK family members have been identiﬁed as being overexpressed or aberrantly activated in a wide variety of cancer types . Additionally , each have also been implicated in controlling cellular processes important in cancer - related functions , such as cell proliferation , apoptosis , motility and invasion . 3 . 1 . CaMKK Despite the restricted expression of CaMKK β in normal cells , it is overexpressed in several types of cancer compared to adjacent benign tissue ( Table 1 ) , including gastric tumours [ 85 ] , hepatocellular carcinoma [ 86 ] , high - grade gliomas [ 87 ] , ovarian [ 88 ] and prostate cancer [ 89 – 91 ] . Androgen stimulation of androgen - dependent and castration - resistant prostate cancer cell lines results in upregulation of CaMKK β [ 89 , 91 , 92 ] , indicating direct regulation by the androgen receptor . Subsequent studies have shown that CaMKK β is a key effector of the androgen receptor in stimulating glycolysis through the activation of AMPK and phosphofructokinase ( PFK ) , which drives anabolism and proliferation of prostate cancer cells [ 91 ] . Furthermore , CaMKK β expression increases with human prostate cancer progression and Gleason score [ 89 , 91 ] , and with tumour progression in a transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate ( TRAMP ) mouse model of prostate cancer [ 89 ] , suggesting that it may also play a role in prostate cancer progression . Increased CaMKK β expression also correlates with poor patient survival in additional tumour types ( Table 1 ) . High CaMKK β expression is associated with poor disease - free survival in hepatic cancer patients [ 86 ] , and poor overall survival in glioma patients [ 87 ] . These studies suggest that CaMKK β may be a useful prognostic marker for liver and brain cancers . Pharmaceuticals 2019 , 12 , 8 7 of 29 Table 1 .

Downregulation of CaMKK β expression using small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) or pharmacological inhibition inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation [ 89 , 91 , 92 , 107 ] , migration and invasion [ 92 ] . Conversely , CaMKK β overexpression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells increases cell migration , further supporting a role for CaMKK β overexpression in prostate cancer progression [ 92 ] . By contrast , Shima et al . showed that CaMKK β overexpression in LNCaP cells decreases cell proliferation and tumour growth in vivo [ 90 ] , indicating that further examination of the role of CaMKK β in prostate cancer cell proliferation is required . Downregulation or pharmacological inhibition of CaMKK β also decreases proliferation , migration and invasion of glioma [ 87 ] , gastric [ 85 , 108 ] and liver cancer [ 86 ] cells and expression of a dominant negative CaMKK mutant suppresses medulloblastoma cell migration [ 109 ] , suggesting that CaMKK activity is essential for this process . Taken together , these studies highlight the importance of CaMKK in controlling cancer cell proliferation and metastatic processes in a range of cancer types , indicating that its role in these functions is not cell - type speciﬁc , and also suggesting that CaMKK β may be a valid anti - cancer target for a variety of cancer types .

CaMKI The various CaMKI isoforms have been shown to be overexpressed in several different cancer subtypes ( Table 1 ) . CaMKI is more highly expressed in stage III and IV endometrial carcinomas , when compared to stage I and II , and is associated with proliferating cellular nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) - labelling , clinical state , histological grade , and the presence of invasion , indicating that CaMKI may play a role in endometrial carcinoma progression [ 94 ] . Expression of several of the speciﬁc CaMKI isoforms have also been examined in speciﬁc cancer types . For example , CaMKI γ / PNCK is overexpressed in a subset of primary breast cancers compared to benign mammary tissue [ 95 ] , and in clear renal cell carcinoma compared to adjacent non - tumour tissues [ 96 ] . Furthermore , a signiﬁcant correlation between PNCK expression and Fuhrman grade , tumour size , T and N stage was observed in these clear cell renal carcinoma samples , and high levels of PNCK is an independent predictor for poor patient survival [ 96 ] . CAMKID has also been identiﬁed as a potential prognostic marker in acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) , as high levels of CAMKID mRNA are associated with signiﬁcantly worse AML patient survival [ 93 ] . Unsurprisingly , CaMKI has been implicated in a variety of cancer - related cellular processes ( Table 2 ) . CaMKI controls the progression of MCF - 7 breast cancer of cells through G 1 [ 110 ] , potentially by regulating cdk4 and retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) phosphorylation , as overexpression of the kinase - inactive CaMKI K49A mutant prevents cdk4 activation and Rb hyperphosphorylation in WI - 38 ﬁbroblasts [ 17 ] . Indeed , knockdown of CaMKI expression in MV - 4 - 11 and Kasumi - 1 AML cells signiﬁcantly decreases cell proliferation and inhibits leukaemia development and prolongs the survival of AML xenografted mice [ 93 ] . By contrast , CaMKI overexpression does not affect leukaemia development , but overexpression of the kinase - inactive CaMKI K49E mutant signiﬁcantly decreases AML colony formation and increases mouse survival in AML transplantation studies [ 93 ] , demonstrating the importance of CaMKI activity in controlling cell proliferation . Similar to expression of a dominant negative CaMKK mutant , expression of a dominant negative CaMKI mutant signiﬁcantly decreases medulloblastoma cell migration [ 109 ] , highlighting the importance of the CaMKK - CaMKI cascade in this cellular process . Murine CKLiK is upregulated by the haematopoietic cell - speciﬁc ETS family transcription factor , PU . 1 , in murine erythroleukemia cells , and is involved in apoptosis [ 122 ] , suggesting that the human homolog of CKLiK may function in a similar fashion . These studies demonstrate that CaMKI can control cell proliferation , migration , and survival in medulloblastoma , breast and haematopoietic cancers , and therefore , may be a potential anti - cancer target for these cancer types . 3 . 3 . CaMKII Tumour cells express an entirely different spectrum of CaMKII isozymes than adult neuronal tissue or their non - transformed tissue counterparts . Eight distinct β , γ and δ CaMKII isozymes have been identiﬁed in human mammary tumour and neuroblastoma cell lines [ 123 ] . In addition to expression of these novel tumour variants , CaMKII is also overexpressed in a variety of cancer types ( Table 1 ) . CaMKII is more highly expressed in stage III and IV endometrial carcinomas when compared to stage I and II , and is associated with PCNA - labelling , clinical state , histological grade , and the presence of invasion , indicating that similar to CaMKI , CaMKII may play a role in endometrial carcinoma progression [ 94 ] . CaMKII is overexpressed in colon cancer compared to adjacent normal tissue and increases with poor differentiation [ 99 ] , and in primary breast cancer compared to adjacent normal breast , as well as in lymph node metastases [ 100 ] , indicating that CaMKII may play a role in cancer progression . In regards to speciﬁc isoforms , CaMKII γ is increased in AML patient blasts compared to normal peripheral blood cells [ 98 ] , in lung cancer compared to normal lung tissue [ 103 ] and is upregulated at diagnosis in chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) [ 97 ] . Additionally , CaMKII γ expression is increased in CML blasts resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors [ 97 ] , glioma cells resistant to the Fas agonistic antibody ( CH - 11 ) [ 124 ] and also in TRAIL - resistant melanoma cells [ 125 ] , suggesting that it may play a role in chemoresistance . Pharmaceuticals 2019 , 12 , 8 14 of 29 The single - nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) rs10023113 in CAMK2D is associated with poor survival of early - stage non - small cell lung cancer patients [ 104 ] , and high expression of CAMK2G in lung cancers is associated with signiﬁcantly worse overall survival in 3 different cohorts [ 103 ] . Additionally , breast cancer samples that express high levels of CAMK2 exhibit signiﬁcantly worse overall and distant metastasis - free survival compared to patients with low CAMK2 expression [ 100 ] . These studies suggest that CaMK2 genes are potential prognostic biomarkers for a range of cancer types . Furthermore , not only is CaMKII expression increased in a variety of cancer types , enhanced autophosphorylation at T286 is also frequently observed ( Table 1 ) . Increased T286 / 7 phosphorylation of CaMKII is noted in TRAIL - resistant melanoma cells [ 125 ] , lung cancer oncospheres [ 103 ] , osteosarcoma [ 101 , 102 ] , leukaemia stem cells [ 126 ] , AML patient blasts [ 98 ] , primary and metastatic breast tumours compared to normal adjacent breast tissue [ 100 ] and in metastatic gastric cancers compared to non - metastatic tissues [ 105 ] , indicating that enhanced CaMKII activity is a feature of cancers , and is also associated with metastatic disease . Each of the CaMKII isoforms has been implicated in the control of a variety of cancer - related functions . In vitro , CaMKII controls cellular differentiation in AML differentiation [ 98 ] and cell proliferation in smooth muscle cells [ 127 – 130 ] , lung cancer [ 111 ] , medullary thyroid cancer [ 112 ] , AML [ 98 ] , glioma [ 120 ] , T cell lymphoma [ 116 ] , osteosarcoma [ 101 ] , and colon [ 99 ] , gastric [ 113 ] and prostate cancers [ 114 ] . In vivo , CaMKII controls osteosarcoma [ 101 , 102 , 131 ] and T cell lymphoma [ 116 ] tumour growth . CaMKII is essential for metastatic processes , including cell migration and invasion in osteosarcoma [ 101 , 102 , 131 ] , glioma [ 118 – 120 ] , and gastric [ 105 , 113 ] , colon [ 99 ] , breast [ 100 ] , and prostate cancers [ 114 , 115 ] . CaMKII activity is essential for this process , as expression of a constitutively active ( H282R ) mutant enhances gastric cancer cell migration and invasion by upregulating matrix metalloproteinase - 9 ( MMP - 9 ) [ 105 ] . Furthermore , CaMKII γ has been implicated in tumourigenesis in a variety of cancer types . CaMKII γ deletion suppresses T cell lymphomagenesis in vivo [ 116 ] . CaMKII γ knockout mice develop fewer tumours , that are smaller than their wild - type counterparts , in a dextran sodium sulfate ( DSS ) and azoxymethane ( AOM ) model of colitis - associated tumourigenesis . Furthermore , only knockout in colonic tissue - resident cells , and not in bone marrow - derived immune cells , is involved in this suppressive effect [ 132 ] . By contrast , CaMKII γ overexpression increases colon proliferation rates , decreases cell death and increases distal colitis - associated cancer compared to control mice [ 132 ] . CaMKII γ − / − mice exhibit increased tumour number and volume in diethylnitrosamine ( DEN ) and DEN followed by tumour promotor models of hepatic cancer [ 133 ] . Additionally , CaMKII γ knockdown inhibits lung cancer tumourigenicity , and overexpression enhances tumourigenicity in vitro and in vivo [ 103 ] . Differentially phosphorylated CaMKII also controls different cellular functions . For example , dephosphorylation of CaMKII at T253 controls the metaphase - anaphase transition in neuroblastoma ( SHSY5Y ) and breast cancer ( MDA - MB - 231 ) cell lines [ 117 ] . Overexpression of wild - type or a T286 phospho - mimic mutant ( T286D ) of CaMKII α increases cancer cell proliferation [ 117 ] , migration and invasion [ 100 ] . By contrast , overexpression of a T253 phospho - mimic mutant ( T253D ) prevents cancer cell proliferation [ 117 ] . Taken together , these studies highlight the importance of CaMKII in controlling cancer cell proliferation and metastatic processes in a range of cancer types , indicating that its role in these functions is not cell - type speciﬁc but broadly applicable , and indicates that CaMKII may be a valid anti - cancer target for a variety of cancer types . 3 . 4 . CaMKIV Despite the restricted expression of CaMKIV in normal tissues , CaMKIV is overexpressed in several different types of cancer ( Table 1 ) . CaMKIV expression and activity is increased in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 106 ] , small cell lung cancer [ 111 ] , and is signiﬁcantly associated with clinical stage , myometrial invasion and clinical outcome in endometrial carcinoma [ 134 ] . Furthermore , Pharmaceuticals 2019 , 12 , 8 15 of 29 high CAMK4 expression is associated with signiﬁcantly worse overall survival for AML patients [ 93 ] , and in endometrial carcinoma [ 135 ] . As CaMKIV is expressed in immune cells , it is not surprising that it has been shown to regulate haematopoietic stem cell homeostasis [ 16 ] . Additionally , CaMKIV has been implicated in cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation . Decreasing CaMKIV expression inhibits AML development in vitro and in vivo [ 93 ] , and decreases hepatic cancer cell proliferation [ 86 ] . By contrast , overexpression of CaMKIV in AML cells arrests cells in G 0 / G 1 , in an activity dependent manner [ 121 ] , suggesting that CaMKIV may have cell line dependent effects , even within the same cancer subtype . 4 . The CaMK Family Are Potential Anti - Cancer Therapeutic Targets Due to the importance of CaMK family members in controlling cancer - related functions , their suitability as anti - cancer targets have begun to be explored . Several pharmacological inhibitors that inhibit the activity of these enzymes have been developed , and their usefulness as anti - cancer treatments in a variety of cancer types has been examined . 4 . 1 . STO - 609 7 - Oxo - 7H - benzimidazo [ 2 , 1 - a ] benz [ de ] isoquinoline - 3 - carboxylic acid ( STO - 609 , Figure 5 ) is a selective CaMKK antagonist that inhibits autophosphorylation of both CaMKK α and CaMKK β [ 136 ] , without any signiﬁcant effect on CaMKI and CaMKIV . However , at doses ~ 100 - fold higher than the half maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC 50 ) for CaMKK , CaMKII and myosin light chain kinase ( MLCK ) are also inhibited . Additionally , STO - 609 has been demonstrated to bind to and activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) [ 137 ] , indicating that STO - 609 may not be as CaMKK selective as initially believed . As CaMKK controls cancer cell proliferation , migration and survival in a variety of cancer types in vitro ( Table 2 ) , inhibiting CaMKK activity may be a valid anti - cancer therapeutic strategy in these cancer types . 3 Figure 5 . Structures of STO - 609 , KN - 62 , KN - 93 , berbamine dihydrochloride and bbd24 . Indeed , STO - 609 decreases AML [ 93 ] , prostate [ 89 , 91 ] , gastric [ 108 ] , hepatocellular [ 86 ] and ovarian cancer cell proliferation [ 88 ] in vitro , and induces apoptosis in ovarian [ 88 ] and gastric cancer lines [ 108 ] . Furthermore , treatment with STO - 609 signiﬁcantly reduces tumour burden in prostate and hepatocellular cancer mouse models in vivo ( Table 3 ) . Systemically administered STO - 609 decreases tumour growth , both as a single agent and additively in combination with AR inhibition , in a C4 - 2B prostate cancer xenograft model [ 91 ] , and in the DEN - induced hepatocellular carcinoma mouse model [ 86 ] , demonstrating that CaMKK inhibition is a valid strategy for the treatment of prostate and hepatic cancer , and based on the in vitro studies , may potentially be suitable for other cancer types , including AML , gastric and ovarian cancers . Intraperitoneal doses of STO - 609 up to 300 µ M / kg , or daily injections of 30 µ M / kg for 4 weeks , have been shown to be well - tolerated in C57Bl / 6 J mice , and did not induce parameters of liver or kidney toxicity [ 138 ] . However , the primary limitation of the use of STO - 609 as an anti - cancer treatment is its poor solubility , therefore improved derivatives that increase solubility , whilst increasing efﬁcacy will need to be developed .

KN - 62 / KN - 93 4 - [ ( 2 S ) - 2 - [ ( 5 - Isoquinolinylsulfonyl ) methylamino ] - 3 - oxo - 3 - ( 4 - pheynl - 1 - piperazinyl ) propyl ] phenylisoquinolinesulfonic acid ester ( KN - 62 ) and N - [ 2 - [ [ [ 3 - ( 4 (cid:48) - chlorophenyl ) - 2 - propenyl ] - methylamino ] methyl ] phenyl ] - N - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 4 (cid:48) - methoxybenzenesulfonamide phosphate salt ( KN - 93 ) ( Figure 5 ) , are membrane permeable CaMKII inhibitors that are competitive for CaM [ 140 ] . They were originally described as CaMKII speciﬁc inhibitors , as they do not affect other CaM - dependent enzymes , such as AMPK and MLCK [ 141 ] . However , subsequent studies have shown that they also inhibit CaMKI and CaMKIV and other molecules unrelated to the CaMK family , including ion channels [ 142 – 146 ] . Both KN - 62 and KN - 93 prevent the activation of CaMKII , but do not inhibit autonomously active CaMKII [ 142 ] . As CaMKI , CaMKII and CaMKIV control cancer cell proliferation , migration and survival in a variety of cancer types in vitro ( Table 2 ) , inhibiting the activity of these kinases using KN - 62 and KN - 93 may be a valid anti - cancer therapeutic strategy for a range of cancer types . Indeed , KN - 93 decreases proliferation in osteosarcoma [ 131 ] , AML [ 98 ] , T cell lymphoma [ 116 ] , prostate cancer [ 114 ] , endometrial cancer [ 94 ] , glioma [ 120 ] , colon cancer [ 99 ] , breast cancer [ 110 ] and medullary thyroid cancer cells [ 112 ] , induces apoptosis in prostate cancer [ 147 , 148 ] , but not AML cells [ 98 ] , and resensitises resistant melanoma cells to TRAIL - induced apoptosis [ 125 ] and resistant glioma cells to CH - 11 [ 124 , 149 ] in vitro . Whilst KN - 62 treatment does not result in apoptosis in cancer cell lines , it induces differentiation in AML cell lines [ 150 ] , suppresses hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) - 1 α in hepatoma cells [ 151 ] , potentiates the effects of etoposide in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [ 152 ] and AML cell lines [ 153 ] , and reverses adriamycin resistance in human ovarian cancer cells [ 154 ] , indicating that it may be useful when combined with additional therapies . Additionally , KN - 93 decreases migration and invasion in osteosarcoma [ 131 ] , breast [ 100 ] , prostate [ 114 ] , colon [ 99 ] and endometrial [ 94 ] cancer cells . Similar ﬁndings have been observed with KN - 62 , as it inhibits gastric cancer cell proliferation , invasion and migration in vitro [ 105 ] . Taken together , these studies indicate that inhibiting CaMK family members using KN - 93 and / or KN - 62 may be suitable for the treatment of metastatic cancer in a range of solid tumours . Furthermore , KN - 93 decreases tumour burden in osteosarcoma xenograft models in vivo ( Table 3 ) . Systemically administered KN - 93 decreases tumour growth in subcutaneous and orthotopic ( intratibial ) MG - 63 osteosarcoma models in vivo , both alone [ 102 ] and in combination with CBO - P11 ( a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) inhibitor ) [ 131 ] . Whilst in vivo studies using these inhibitors do not describe any side - effects , KN - 62 and KN - 93 have been widely used to examine a variety of heart and brain - related functions . For example , KN - 62 and KN - 93 can depress the rate of beating of cultured myocytes [ 155 ] and afterdepolarisation in the heart [ 156 ] , respectively , and can block long - term potentiation ( LTP ) in rat hippocampus [ 157 ] , indicating that they are likely to affect cardiac , learning and memory processes . Due to these potential side effects , as well as the range of off - target effects using these inhibitors , these inhibitors are unlikely to be translated into clinical use without modiﬁcation or the use of alternative more cancer - selective modes of drug delivery ( e . g . , nanoparticles or liposomes ) . 4 . 3 . Substrate Based Inhibitors : Autocamtide - 3 Derived Peptide Inhibitor ( AC3 - I ) and Autocamtide - 2 - Related Inhibitory Peptide ( AIP ) Long inhibitory peptides based on the autoinhibitory domain of CaMKII α have been developed . The N - terminus of this peptide contains the autophosphorylation site forming the basis for peptide substrates such as autocamtide - 2 and - 3 [ 158 ] and the development of a non - phosphorylatable analogue of autocamtide - 2 generated the peptide inhibitors AIP ( KKALRRQEAVDAL ) [ 140 ] and AC3 - I ( KKALHRQEAVDCL ) [ 159 ] . AIP competes with the active site of CaMKII , inhibiting activity regardless of how CaMKII was activated , and inhibits CaMKII with over 100 - fold selectivity relative to protein kinase C ( PKC ) , PKA and CaMKIV . However , altered selectivity can also occur when peptides are fused to GFP or modiﬁed by lipids to increase membrane permeability . For example , myristoylated Pharmaceuticals 2019 , 12 , 8 18 of 29 AIP has been shown to have effects unrelated to CaMKII inhibition [ 160 ] , indicating the presence of an additional non - CaMKII - related target , and green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - AC3 - I can inhibit cellular actions of protein kinase D1 ( PKD1 ) [ 161 ] . AIP signiﬁcantly attenuates glioma [ 119 , 162 ] and breast cancer [ 100 ] migration and invasion . Furthermore , AC3 - I treatment arrests ovarian carcinoma cells in G 2 and stops proliferation [ 163 ] . These studies indicate that CaMKII inhibition may be a viable therapeutic option for the treatment of metastatic disease . 4 . 4 . CaMKIIN Derived Peptides ( CaMKIINtide ) Small endogenous proteins that inhibit CaMKII ( CaMKIIN ) have been identiﬁed in rat brain [ 164 ] and there are two known rat isoforms—CaMKIIN α [ 164 ] and CaMKIIN β [ 165 ] . Human CaMKIIN has also been identiﬁed in human dendritic cells [ 166 ] . CaMKIIN is implicated in the control of progression of cells through S phase . Overexpression of hCaMKIIN in colon cancer cells decreases cell proliferation , whereas silencing increases cell growth rates [ 166 , 167 ] . Furthermore , hCaMKIIN overexpression in ovarian cancer cells decreases proliferation and tumourigenicity [ 168 , 169 ] , and also reduces migration and colony formation [ 169 ] . This implies a potential application of hCaMKIIN in the treatment of colon and ovarian cancers . Identiﬁcation of the core inhibitory domain of CaMKIIN led to the generation of a 28 amino acid peptide inhibitor called CaMKIINtide [ 164 ] . CaMKIINtide only inhibits activated CaMKII [ 164 ] , and does not inhibit PKC , PKA , CaMKI , CaMKIV or CaMKK [ 164 ] . CaMKIINtide has also been modiﬁed to increase potency [ 170 , 171 ] . A cell permeable form , antCaNtide , decreases medullary thyroid cancer [ 112 ] , and AML cell proliferation [ 121 ] indicating that the development of additional CaMKII speciﬁc inhibitors may provide viable therapeutic options for the treatment of haematological and thyroid cancers . 4 . 5 . Berbamine Dihydrochloride Berbamine ( Figure 5 ) is a natural bis - benzylisoquinoline alkaloid , isolated from the traditional Chinese herbal medicine Berberis amurensis . Berbamine exhibits potent antitumour activities with low toxicity in a variety of cancer types , including melanoma , hepatocellular carcinoma , breast cancer , leukaemia and lung cancer [ 126 , 172 – 178 ] . Recently , berbamine was shown to produce its anti - cancer effects by blocking the ATP binding pocket of CaMKII γ [ 126 ] , however , berbamine also inhibits molecules unrelated to CaMKII , including mechano - electrical transducer channels , the Bcr / Abl fusion gene , and the NF - κ B pathway [ 175 , 179 , 180 ] . 2 - methylbenzoyl berbamine ( bbd24 ) ( Figure 5 ) , a derivative of berbamine and a more potent CaMKII inhibitor , has been identiﬁed [ 126 ] . Berbamine inhibits the growth and reduces the viability of liver cancer [ 139 ] and CML cells [ 126 ] in a CaMKII γ dependent manner . Bbd24 also kills liver cancer cells in vitro [ 139 ] . Berbamine has been shown to reduce tumour burden in several different animal models ( Table 3 ) . Berbamine decreases liver cancer [ 139 ] and CML [ 126 ] tumour burden in vivo and decreases tumour burden and signiﬁcantly increases survival in an N - methyl - N - nitrosurea ( MNU ) - induced lymphoma model [ 116 ] . The main limitation for the use of berbamine clinically as an anti - cancer agent is its short plasma half - life and poor bioavailability at the tumour site after systemic administration . To circumvent this , lipid - based nanoparticles loaded with berbamine have been developed and have been shown to decrease primary tumour growth in a B16F10 mouse melanoma model and also suppress the incidence of lung metastases in vivo [ 181 ] . This highlights that newer mechanisms of drug delivery may be useful clinically to increase the cancer - speciﬁcity of these drugs , without enhancing toxicity . 5 . Concluding Remarks and Perspectives The CaMK family members , particularly CaMKII , are attractive anti - cancer targets as they are overexpressed in a plethora of cancer types , compared to adjacent normal tissue , and are vital in the modulation of cancer cell proliferation , survival , invasion and migration . Several targeted and Pharmaceuticals 2019 , 12 , 8 19 of 29 broad - acting CaMK inhibitors have demonstrated pre - clinical anti - cancer efﬁcacy in vivo . Many of the previously believed ‘CaMK - speciﬁc’ inhibitors have been shown to have a variety of off - target effects , which further limits their clinical usefulness . By contrast , CaMKIIN - tide , and its modiﬁed derivatives , based on the endogenous CaMKII inhibitory protein ( CaMKIIN ) have no described off - target effects , and are the most promising lead compounds for further development described here - in , however , their usefulness in vivo remains to be investigated . Additionally , as the CaMK family members are also involved in highly important , non - cancer related functions , direct inhibition using these existing CaMK inhibitors are likely to produce a range of deleterious side - effects if used clinically . Therefore , to be useful therapeutically , cancer - speciﬁc inhibitors or more cancer - speciﬁc modes of drug delivery would be required to be developed . One such potential strategy would be to encapsulate these CaMK inhibitors in nanoparticles or liposomes that speciﬁcally target cancer cells for the delivery of the inhibitor . Whilst this has been examined in other disease models for CaMKIIN inhibitory peptides , such as heart disease and asthma [ 182 , 183 ] , they remain to be tested in cancer .
