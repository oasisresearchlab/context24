Primarily , ℜ 0 serves as an indicator of the transmission potential of an 2 emerging infectious disease and the effort required to control the invading pathogen . However , 3 its estimates from compartmental models are strongly conditioned by assumptions in the 4 model structure , such as the distributions of the latent and infectious periods ( epidemiological 5 delays ) . To further complicate matters , models with dissimilar delay structures produce 6 equivalent incidence dynamics . Following a simulation study , we reveal that the nature 7 of such equivalency stems from a linear relationship between ℜ 0 and the mean generation 8 time , along with adjustments to other parameters in the model . Leveraging this knowledge , 9 we propose and successfully test an alternative parameterisation of the SEIR model that 10 produces accurate ℜ 0 estimates regardless of the distribution of the epidemiological delays , 11 at the expense of biases in other quantities deemed of lesser importance . We further explore 12 this approach’s robustness by testing various transmissibility levels , generation times , and 13 data fidelity ( overdispersion ) . Finally , we apply the proposed approach to data from the 14 1918 influenza pandemic . We anticipate that this work will mitigate biases in estimating ℜ 0 . 15 K eywords SEIR · Basic reproduction number · Distributions of the latent & infectious period · Mean 16 generation time · Stan · Inference 17 1 Introduction 18 The analysis of any infectious disease’s dynamics will inevitably lead to the basic reproduction number ( ℜ 0 ) . 19 Initially developed in the study of demographics [ 1 ] , this quantity has been interpreted in the epidemiological 20 context as the average number of secondary infections arising from the introduction of one infected individual 21 into a totally susceptible population [ 2 ] . The usefulness and importance of ℜ 0 lie primarily in its threshold 22 phenomenon [ 3 ] . That is , a pathogen can invade a totally susceptible population only if ℜ 0 > 1 [ 4 ] . 23 ∗ Corresponding author A preprint - July 10 , 2023 Furthermore , the magnitude of ℜ 0 gauges the transmission potential of an emerging infectious disease [ 3 ] 24 and the effort required to control the invading pathogen [ 5 ] . Thus , accurate estimation of ℜ 0 is crucial for 25 understanding and managing infectious diseases . 26 Another reason for the popularity of ℜ 0 is that one can estimate it from epidemiological data [ 6 ] using a 27 number of methods . For diseases that allow the assumption of endemic equilibrium and homogeneous mixing , 28 one can follow Mollison’s method [ 7 ] or Dietz’s approach [ 8 ] . The former requires prevalence data , whereas 29 the latter leverages readily available information such as age at infection and average life expectancy . On the 30 other hand , if an infection leads to either immunity or death in a closed population , seroprevalence studies 31 can inform the fraction of the population that acquired the disease during an epidemic , i . e . the final epidemic 32 size . In their seminal paper , Kermack and McKendrick [ 9 , 10 ] formulated a relationship between the final 33 epidemic size and ℜ 0 , from which the latter can be calculated . Unlike the previous methods , which require 34 the epidemic to reach a steady state , ℜ 0 may be determined from the intrinsic growth rate of the infected 35 population [ 3 , 5 ] using incidence data of the early stages of the epidemic , as long as the growth of new cases 36 exhibits pure exponential behaviour . Alternatively , we can employ the entire report of daily case notifications 37 if ℜ 0 is formulated as a function of a compartmental model’s parameters [ 11 – 13 ] . These models can be 38 stochastic [ 14 ] , semi - deterministic [ 15 , 16 ] or deterministic [ 9 , 17 ] . 39 These compartmental models are said to be mechanistic [ 18 ] , namely , structures based on a scientific 40 understanding of infectious disease dynamics [ 19 ] . The relevance of that mechanistic property lies in the role 41 of the model . Rather than being a merely mathematical artefact to produce a desired output , the model 42 also embeds a dynamic hypothesis of the underlying process that generates the observed data . Hence , the 43 parameters , states and interactions that comprise a particular formulation represent their counterparts in the 44 real world . If the model accurately captures the properties of the actual phenomenon , finding an adequate 45 configuration ( assign values to parameters ) should yield a behaviour over time of infections that resembles 46 the observed trajectory . The values of such parameters can be obtained from individual - level observations [ 4 ] 47 or via statistical inference [ 20 – 22 ] , a process also known as trajectory matching or model fitting . 48 Furthermore , matching simulated and observed behaviour can be regarded as a validation test on the dynamic 49 hypothesis that links structure to behaviour [ 23 ] . Nevertheless , one should understand this validation step as 50 a falsification test [ 24 ] . That is , if the model fails to reproduce the observed behaviour , it can certainly be 51 rejected . On the contrary , obtaining an accurate match ( or fit ) does not immediately validate the dynamic 52 hypothesis inasmuch as there may be other competing hypotheses that fit the data equally well . Indeed , 53 this circumstance impacts the estimation of ℜ 0 from compartmental models ( and the intrinsic growth rate 54 method ) , where different assumptions can yield accurate fits [ 25 ] . However , estimates vary according to the 55 specific assumptions embedded in each fitting model [ 3 , 26 ] . 56 For instance , the choice of the distributions of the latent and infectious periods ( epidemiological delays ) in 57 the deterministic Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Recovered ( SEIR ) framework plays an essential role in the 58 inference of ℜ 0 [ 25 ] . Briefly put , misspecifying the structure of such delays leads to biases in the estimates . 59 That is , a systematic difference between true and estimated parameters . Although there are techniques 60 [ 27 , 28 ] to construct models with realistic distributions , modellers do not know exactly which distribution to 61 incorporate in their formulation . In view of this drawback , Wearing and colleagues [ 25 ] fitted various SEIR 62 models ( with different delay distributions ) to a single incidence dataset to select the best structure based on a 63 goodness - of - fit measure . Nevertheless , the results appear inconclusive . Notwithstanding that Krylova & Earn 64 [ 29 ] assume their validity , no further research establishes the reliability of such an approach . This assessment 65 immediately warrants the need for the work presented here : a systematic study oriented to determine whether 66 it is possible to infer ℜ 0 accurately from SEIR models fitted to incidence data in light of the uncertainty in 67 the distributions of the epidemiological delays . We describe the steps of this study in the sections below . All 68 the analysis is performed in R . The code is freely available at https : / / github . com / jandraor / delays . 69 2 Data Generating Process 70 2 . 1 The system ( latent ) component 71 In order to undertake a systematic study , experimenters must have access to a sizeable set of observations . 72 In this case , multiple time series of daily case notifications of a particular disease under various conditions . 73 Equally important , such conditions need to be known a priori . To meet these conditions , we leverage the 74 mechanistic property of compartmental models and employ the SEIR framework as a synthetic data generator 75 [ 30 , 31 ] . This framework has been widely applied to studying various infectious diseases , such as measles 76 [ 29 , 32 , 33 ] , COVID - 19 [ 16 , 34 , 35 ] , and influenza [ 12 , 17 , 22 , 36 – 38 ] . In this work , we restrict our attention to 77 2 A preprint - July 10 , 2023 the simplest version of this family of models . The rationale for this decision is straightforward ; conceptual 78 models entail efficiency inasmuch as they facilitate the understanding and identification of the underlying 79 causes of a particular result . Moreover , it is often the case that principles that stem from basic models apply 80 to more elaborated extensions . 81 ˙ S t = − βS t P jk = 1 I kt N ˙ E 1 t = βS t P jk = 1 I kt N − iσE 1 t ˙ E 2 t = iσE 1 t − iσE 2 t . . . ˙ E it = iσE i − 1 t − iσE it ˙ I 1 t = iσE it − jγI 1 t ˙ I 2 t = jγI 1 t − jγI 2 t . . . ˙ I jt = jγI j − 1 t − jγI jt ˙ R t = jγI jt ( 1 ) Specifically , the SEIR ( Eq 1 ) stratifies individuals as susceptible ( S t ) , exposed ( E t ) , infectious ( I t ) , and 82 recovered ( R t ) and describes the transitions between states ( S t → E t → I t → R t ) in terms of differential 83 equations . Susceptible individuals acquire infection , S t → E t , through contact with infectious individuals , 84 where the number of contacts is independent of the population size ( N ) . Formally , one refers to this 85 assumption as the frequency - dependent ( or mass action ) transmission : βS t I t / N . Here , β corresponds to the 86 effective contact rate or transmission parameter . The movement of individuals from the class E t to class R t is 87 modelled using a well - known mathematical procedure [ 39 ] to achieve realistic distributions [ 40 , 41 ] of the time 88 that individuals spend in states E t and I t , otherwise known as the latent and infectious periods , respectively . 89 Such a procedure corresponds to the subdivision of a class into stages arranged in series . For instance , one 90 can divide the exposed class into i stages . Newly infected individuals enter the first exposed stage , E 1 t , pass 91 through each in turn and become infectious upon leaving the ith stage ( E it ) . The progression between stages 92 is assumed to occur at a constant per - capita rate ( iσ ) , leading to an exponential waiting time with mean 93 1 iσ in each stage [ 11 ] . This formulation implies that the lapse between infection and becoming infectious is 94 described by the sum of i independent exponential random variables with equal rates , a convolution resulting 95 in a gamma - distributed random variable [ 42 ] . Therefore , the subdivision of the exposed class into various 96 stages is equivalent to formulate the latent period in terms of a gamma distribution with mean σ − 1 and shape 97 i . Similarly , one can divide the infectious class into j stages to formulating a gamma - distributed infectious 98 period . 99 ℜ 0 = βγ − 1 ( 2 ) Overall , we refer to Eq 1 as the SE i I j R framework . Notice that the standard SEIR corresponds to the 100 SE 1 I 1 R instance . Moreover , as the parameter i increases , the distribution becomes more closely centred on 101 its mean ( tighter ) , to the extent that if i → ∞ , the variance is removed . That is , in the limit , all individuals 102 have the same latent period . An equivalent argument applies to the infectious period . No less important , as 103 indicated by [ 11 ] , irrespective of the values of i and j that the SE i I j R may take , the basic reproduction 104 number depends exclusively on the transmission rate and the mean infectious period ( Eq 2 ) . Furthermore , it 105 is noteworthy to mention that subdividing a class is a mathematical device that allows the incorporation of 106 additional distributions in a system of differential equations , and the number of stages may not correspond 107 to biological features of the infection process [ 32 ] . Lastly , we assume that the disease leads to permanent 108 immunity and that the outbreak’s time scale is much faster than the characteristic times for demographic 109 processes ( births and deaths ) , therefore their effects are not included . This last assumption implies that the 110 population remains constant over the simulation period . 111 3 A preprint - July 10 , 2023 ˙ C t = ρiσE it x t ∗ = C t ∗ + 1 − C t ∗ , t ∗ ∈ N 0 ( 3 ) Subsequently , we define the link between the SE i I j R and incidence data ( Eq 3 ) . Based on the literature 112 [ 15 , 16 , 22 , 36 ] , we posit that incidence ( ˙ C ) is proportional to the rate at which individuals become infectious 113 ( E it → I 1 t ) . Such proportional effect or reporting rate ( ρ ) stems from the fact that individuals experience 114 various degrees of symptom severity [ 43 ] . In particular , individuals with low severity levels ( asymptomatic 115 and mild symptoms ) may not seek health care attention , resulting in case reports that most likely miss 116 a significant fraction of infected individuals . As opposed to the continuous nature of differential equation 117 models , case notifications occur at discrete times . To reconcile this tension , we define the report of new cases 118 ( x t ∗ ) as the change in the total number of cases ( C t ) in one - day intervals . 119 Furthermore , we tailor the synthetic data generator towards influenza given that this virus causes unpredictable 120 but recurring pandemics that can have significant global consequences [ 44 ] . As a matter of fact , there have 121 been four influenza pandemics over the past 100 years , including the H1N1 pandemic in 1918 , with 50 122 estimated million deaths [ 45 ] . Adapting the SE i I j R framework to this choice involves the selection of 123 plausible parameter values or ground truths [ 46 ] . For simplicity , we restrict the synthetic data generator 124 to eight instances : i = { 1 , 3 } × j = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } . These instances share constants σ , γ , β , ρ , and N , which 125 are configured identically . In particular , we configure parameters σ and γ from the assumed values ( 12 for 126 both ) in the Cumberland case study [ 12 , 22 ] . Following this choice , we select a value of β that yields a basic 127 reproduction number ( 2 . 5 ) within a plausible range ( 2 - 4 ) of pandemic influenza [ 47 ] . Regarding ρ , we choose 128 a value ( 0 . 75 ) consistent with reported estimates in the literature [ 12 , 22 ] . The remaining constant , N , has 129 only a scaling effect , and any particular value ( 10 , 000 in this case ) does not alter the model dynamics provided 130 that N = S 0 + E 0 + I 0 + R 0 , where E 0 = P ik = 1 E k 0 and I 0 = P jk = 1 I k 0 . In relation to initial conditions , 131 we assume that a patient zero triggers the outbreak of a novel influenza pathogen . In mathematical terms , 132 S 0 = N − 1 and I 10 = 1 . The remaining initial conditions of the within - host profile are set to zero . 133 Having delimited the SE i I j R framework and configured its instances , we run simulations ( Fig 1 ) that 134 illustrate the impact of the delay structure on the incidence dynamics . In agreement with the literature 135 [ 4 , 25 ] , note in Fig 1 that if we fix the latent period distribution ( i ) and vary that for the infectious period ( j ) , 136 incidence reports that stem from more tightly distributed infectious periods ( larger j ) reach the incidence 137 peak earlier and end more abruptly . This difference in behaviour over time occurs despite the fact that these 138 instances share identical ℜ 0 and equal average latent and infectious periods . On the other hand , if we fix the 139 infectious period ( compare two lines of the same colour across panels ) , decreasing the latent period’s variance 140 ( increasing i from 1 to 3 ) produces the opposite effect . Namely , tighter latent period distributions ( larger i ) 141 push forward the peak time and extend the outbreak’s duration . 142 2 . 2 Measurement component 143 Y t ∗ ∼ Nbin ( x t ∗ , ϕ ) ( 4 ) Borrowing terminology from the state - space literature [ 18 , 48 ] , one can frame the output produced by the 144 SE i I j R framework as predictions obtained from a system or latent component . In practice , though , continous 145 and smooth predictions from ODE models differ from noisy and discrete incidence reports collected by 146 public health surveillance . Moreover , given that a system component is merely a partial representation of 147 a more complex reality , some elements are necessarily omitted . Consequently , it is required to equip the 148 data generating process with a structure that accounts for the discrepancies between model prediction and 149 actual data . We refer to this structure as the measurement component . In epidemiology , one can formulate 150 the measurement of new infections via the Negative Binomial distribution , considering that this function 151 does not tie the observation mean to the variance , offering the flexibility to account for overdispersion [ 19 ] . 152 Accordingly , we define the observation of new cases ( Y t ∗ ) in terms of a Negative Binomial distribution ( Eq 4 ) 153 specified by location ( mean ) and diffusion parameters . The former corresponds to the predicted incidence by 154 the system component ( x t ∗ ) , whereas the latter ( ϕ ) modulates the concentration of measurements . Note that 155 the inverse of the concentration parameter ( ϕ − 1 ) represents overdispersion inasmuch as an increase in its 156 magnitude leads to greater diffusion in the data . 157 Defining a measurement component completes the formulation of the data generating process . Consequently , 158 we draw samples from Eq 4 using statistical simulation ( rnbinom in R ) . For each SE i I j R instance , we 159 generate 40 noisy time series . We perform this process for two levels ( high and low ) of data fidelity , a 160 4 A preprint - July 10 , 2023 j = 1 j = 2 j = 3 j = 4 j = 1 j = 2 j = 3 j = 4 i = 3 i = 1 0 20 40 60 0 200 400 0 200 400 Day I n c i den c e r a t e [ N e w c a s e s / da y ] i : Number of stages in the exposed class ( E ) j : Number of stages in the infectious class ( I ) Figure 1 : Incidence reports generated by various instances of the SE i I j R framework . In this plot , we present two distributions of the latent period and four distributions of the infectious period . The colour of a line corresponds to a particular value of j ( infectious period distribution ) .

Dashed lines indicate that the incidence report stems from an SEIR model with a gamma - distributed latent period ( i = 3 ) . feature measured by ϕ − 1 . High - fidelity data ( ϕ − 1 = 0 ) implies that the measurement component applies 161 only a slight distortion on the original signal ( incidence ) . Notice that this configuration of the Negative 162 Binomial ( with no overdispersion ) is equivalent to the Poisson distribution . Conversely , a positive value 163 ( overdispersion ) of ϕ − 1 ( such as 1 / 3 ) distorts the original signal to such an extent that one cannot easily 164 discern the underlying incidence dynamics ( low - fidelity data ) . We generated a total of 320 incidence reports , 165 of which Fig 2 presents a sample of four representative reports . The reader can find the complete details 166 in the electronic supplementary material S1 . To facilitate the communication of results , we introduce the 167 notation D ij , which indicates the origin of a given set of time series . For example , D 14 indicates that the 168 observed incidence was obtained from the SE 1 I 4 R instance . 169 3 Inference 170 The synthetic incidence reports described in the previous section allow us to assess the performance of various 171 candidate models in recovering ground truths , particularly ℜ 0 , our quantity of interest . Specifically , we fit 172 model candidates to incidence data following a Bayesian approach [ 22 , 49 ] . That is , each candidate’s unknown 173 parameters are treated as random variables , which describe the knowledge ( or uncertainty ) about their actual 174 values [ 50 ] , expressed in terms of a probability distribution . This distribution is updated in light of new 175 information summarised by a likelihood function . This function evaluates the compatibility between a given 176 5 A preprint - July 10 , 2023 j = 1 j = 4 j = 1 j = 4 f - 1 = 0 ( High−fidelity ) f - 1 = 1 / 3 ( Low−fidelity ) 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 0 200 400 600 0 200 400 600 Day M ea s u r ed i n c i den c e [ N e w c a s e s / da y ] Points : Synthetic data The basis for this data stems from simulating SEIR instances with one stage in the exposed class ( E ) and j stages in the infectious class ( I ) . Figure 2 : Sample of synthetic data . This plot shows four representative incidence reports ( dots ) obtained from the simulation of two SE 1 I j R instances ( lines ) . To obtain each report , we sample from the negative binomial distribution . incidence report and multiple configurations of a model candidate [ 51 ] . Such updating process yields the 177 target or posterior distribution , an information device whereby we derive answers for our inferential questions . 178 We approximate the posterior distribution via sampling using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo or HMC [ 52 ] , an 179 algorithm successfully employed to perform statistical inference from epidemiological models [ 16 , 17 , 22 , 53 , 54 ] . 180 This algorithm is provided by the statistical package Stan [ 55 ] . 181 3 . 1 Three unknowns ( traditional ) : β , ρ , I 0 182 For simplicity , we initially restrict the inference analysis to D 1 j high - fidelity observations . To fit each incidence 183 report , we postulate four instances , j = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } , from the SE 1 I j R framework , which share identical mean 184 latent and infectious periods . We refer to the approach of fixing the means of the epidemiological delays 185 to values obtained from the literature , regardless of their distribution , as the traditional parameterisation . 186 Moreover , it is assumed that the measurement component is fully known . Consequently , discrepancies between 187 estimated and actual values are ascribed to misspecification in the infectious period distribution . To avoid 188 confusion between the origin of data and the fitting model , we denote the latter as M ij . As a consequence , 189 this design requires the estimation of 320 posterior distributions . Given this process’s computational burden , 190 we limit the number of random variables in each model to three : the transmission rate ( β ) , the reporting rate 191 ( ρ ) and the initial number of infected individuals in stage one ( I 10 ) . The remaining parameters and initial 192 conditions are considered to be known , i . e . they are fixed to their actual values . Based on this setup , we fit 193 each candidate to a given dataset using HMC sampling , with four Markov chains and 1000 iterations ( plus 194 1000 for warm - up ) each , checking for convergence and effective sample sizes . The complete set of results can 195 be found in the electronic supplementary material S2 § 1 . 196 The results presented in Fig 3 replicate a finding previously reported in the literature [ 25 , 56 ] : the existence of 197 a subtle yet fundamental interaction between the assumed model structure and estimated ℜ 0 . Misspecifying 198 the infectious period distribution with a tighter distribution ( higher j ) generates lower ℜ 0 estimates ( Fig 199 3A ) . Furthermore , regardless of the assumed distribution of the infectious period , all candidate models 200 fit the data equally well . To emphasise the importance and implications of this observation , we compare 201 6 A preprint - July 10 , 2023 j 1 2 3 4 M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 True model : D 11 True model : D 12 True model : D 13 True model : D 14 2 . 2 2 . 6 3 . 0 2 . 2 2 . 6 3 . 0 2 . 2 2 . 6 3 . 0 2 . 2 2 . 6 3 . 0 Basic reproduction number ( ℜ 0 ) Error bars : Estimates from M 1j fitting instances Vertical line : True value j : # of stages in the infectious class ( I ) D ⁱ ʲ : Data generator ' s distribution M ⁱ ʲ : Fitting model ' s distribution A M 11 D 11 M 11 D 14 M 14 D 11 M 14 D 14 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 0 200 400 0 200 400 Days La t en t i n c i den c e ( x ) Points : D 1j Lines : M 1j B Figure 3 : Inference results obtained from the three - unknown parameterisation .

Given the high - fidelity data , all inferred incidences are nearly identical , giving the impression of only one line in each panel . inferred and actual latent incidences in Fig 3B . Recall that fitting a candidate model to a given incidence ( y t ) 202 produces a set of samples that describes the posterior distribution . Then , we use those samples to simulate 203 the candidate’s system component , thereby generating inferred latent incidences ( lines in Fig 3B ) . Then , 204 those lines are compared to x t ∗ , the true latent incidence ( Fig 1 ) . Notice that by definition , we do not have 205 access to x t ∗ in practical applications , but by virtue of this simulation study , such an impediment is overcome . 206 The comparison reveals a symmetry shared among the candidate models . That is , any of these formulations 207 can match the true latent incidence provided that β , ρ and I 10 are configured appropriately . It is important 208 to remark that this symmetry is restricted to the latent incidence and does not extend to the dynamics of 209 other states . For instance , candidates with different delay distributions that yield equivalent incidences will 210 not reach the same long - term equilibrium , given the differences in their ℜ 0 . 211 7 A preprint - July 10 , 2023 Logically , such symmetry should render the approach of comparing fit scores impractical . A fit score , such 212 as the Maximum Likelihood Estimate ( MLE ) , measures the consistency between a dataset and the output 213 generated by a model . Since candidates produce equivalent output , differences among MLEs will solely reflect 214 the stochasticity ( noise ) of the measurement component . We empirically verify this conjecture by selecting 215 the candidate with the largest MLE for each incidence report ( see the electronic supplementary material S2 216 § 1 . 3 . 2 ) . We observe that M 11 candidates attain the largest MLE in only 12 out of 20 times when matching 217 D 11 incidence reports . Even worse , M 13 instances are always outperformed in fitting D 13 datasets . Overall , 218 no candidate passes the 60 % mark . Similarly , the mean absolute scaled error ( MASE ) , a metric specifically 219 designed for evaluating the accuracy of time - series forecasts [ 57 ] , indicates that candidates produce virtually 220 identical scores when fitting any given incidence report . In light of this evidence , one can safely conclude 221 that score comparison is not a reliable approach to determining the correct distribution of epidemiological 222 delays from incidence data . To further complicate matters , information criteria ( such as AIC and BIC ) 223 and cross - validation methods cannot assist in this task , considering that the evaluated structures produce 224 equivalent output and share an equal number of unknown parameters . 225 3 . 2 Four unknowns : β , ρ , I 0 , γ 226 The reason for such inherent symmetry is the generation time , the time between the infection of a primary case 227 and one of its secondary cases [ 58 ] . This quantity’s shape , in tandem with ℜ 0 , determines the initial dynamics 228 of an infectious disease [ 5 ] . Interestingly , these elements also characterise long - term behaviour . Krylova & 229 Earn [ 29 ] found that SEIR models that account for demographic processes with different delay distributions 230 produce equivalent dynamics of epidemiological transitions ( e . g . from annual to biennial epidemic cycles ) if 231 they share identical ℜ 0 and mean generation time ( τ ) . An analytical expression for this last quantity can 232 obtained using the method described by Svensson [ 58 ] . In particular , for the SE i I j R framework , τ can be 233 expressed as a function of the average delays ( σ − 1 , γ − 1 ) and the infectious period distribution ( j ) . 234 τ = σ − 1 + j + 1 2 j γ − 1 ( 5 ) In this analysis , we have , until now , fixed the mean generation time on each candidate model by excluding σ 235 and γ from the inference process . Taking note of the effects on short and long - term dynamics that produce 236 the interaction between τ and ℜ 0 , we now promote γ to the category of estimated parameter in order to 237 explore the impact of a variable mean generation time . The reason for choosing γ as the extra parameter 238 is based on the fact that it interacts with both quantities of interest ( Eqs 2 and 5 ) . This choice implies 239 the need for estimating four parameters per model instance . To do so , we follow the approach described in 240 the previous section . The reader can find the full set of results in the electronic supplementary material S2 241 § 2 . Unsurprisingly , given the extra degree of freedom , all candidates fit any of the incidence data equally 242 well . In this design , though , the match between synthetic data and fitting model’s output is achieved at the 243 expense of less precision , although greater accuracy . Precision refers to the width of uncertainty intervals , 244 and accuracy to whether the interval captures the actual value . To illustrate this phenomenon , in Fig 4 , we 245 present the results of fitting four candidates models ( M 1 j ) to four incidence reports that stem from different 246 distributions of the infectious period ( D 1 j ) . Here , we see that the range of ℜ 0 widened ( Fig 4A ) compared to 247 that presented in the previous section ( Fig 3A ) . 248 Undoubtedly , the primary insight from allowing γ to vary is the unravelled interaction between ℜ 0 and τ . 249 We visualise this interaction by plugging samples of β and γ into Eqs 2 and 5 to obtain an approximation of 250 the expected values of ℜ 0 and τ . When these two quantities are displayed on a scatter plot ( Fig 4B ) , a linear 251 relationship appears , regardless of the data’s origin or the fitting model’s structure . The interpretation of 252 such linear association indicates that for a given fitting model , infinite pairs of ℜ 0 and τ yield equivalent 253 incidence dynamics . However , in virtue of their linear relationship , each value of τ corresponds to exactly one 254 value of ℜ 0 . 255 3 . 3 Three unknowns ( alternative ) : ℜ − 1 0 , ρ , I 0 256 More importantly , the linear relationships shown in Fig 4B reveal an intriguing insight . Notice that irrespective 257 of the structure ( M 1 j ) fitting data of any origin ( D 1 j ) , the true values of ℜ 0 and τ as a pair ( the intersection 258 between the dotted and dashed lines ) are subsumed into any of the linear associations . This observation 259 implies that the true ℜ 0 can correspond only to the right τ . Therefore , it could be possible to accurately 260 estimate ℜ 0 from a model whose mean generation time is fixed to the true underlying value , but the shape of 261 the epidemiological delays may differ from that of the data generating process . To test this hypothesis , we 262 8 A preprint - July 10 , 2023 j 1 2 3 4 M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 True model : D 11 True model : D 12 True model : D 13 True model : D 14 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 Basic reproduction number ( ℜ 0 ) Error bars : Estimates from M 1j fitting instances Vertical line : True value j : # of stages in the infectious class ( I ) D ⁱ ʲ : Data generator ' s distribution M ⁱ ʲ : Fitting model ' s distribution A D 11 D 12 D 13 D 14 M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 0 5 10 0 5 10 0 5 10 0 5 10 0 3 6 0 3 6 0 3 6 0 3 6 Mean generation time ( τ ) B a s i c r ep r odu c t i on nu m be r ( ℜ 0 ) Points : Estimates from M 1j fitting instances Dashed line : Data ' s generation time Dotted line : Data ' s basic reproduction number B D 12 0 5 10 0 2 4 6 τ ℜ 0 Points : M 1j C Figure 4 : Inference results obtained from the four - unknown parameterisation .

These distributions are represented via samples . From each sample , we compute the predicted ℜ 0 and τ ( dots ) . C ) This plot collapses the second column in B into a single panel . 9 A preprint - July 10 , 2023 reformulate the SE i I j R framework so that τ becomes a parameter of every model instance . Consequently , we 263 combine Eqs 2 and 5 into 6 , which expresses β as a dependent variable of four parameters : j , σ , τ , and ℜ 0 . 264 β = 2 j ( τ − σ − 1 ) ℜ − 1 0 ( j + 1 ) γ = β ℜ − 1 0 ( 6 ) Parameter j is based on the fitting model’s structure , whereas σ and τ are fixed to the true values that 265 produced the incidence reports . For instance , a D 12 report stems from a structure whose σ and τ are equal 266 to 0 . 5 and 3 . 5 ( applying Eq 5 ) , respectively . Therefore , an M 14 candidate fitting this report has j , σ , and τ 267 fixed to 4 , 0 . 5 , and 3 . 5 , respectively . An immediate consequence of this procedure is the need to constrain γ in 268 order to maintain logical consistency . Accordingly , we define γ as a function of β and ℜ 0 ( 6 ) . This approach 269 is analogous to fixing γ to an arbitrary value that yields the desired τ . Such a value may not correspond to 270 that of the data generating process . Lastly , the remaining parameter , ℜ 0 , is subject to inference . We opt to 271 estimate its inverse for a practical reason . Taking into account the threshold phenomenon and the fact that 272 all incidence reports exhibit outbreak - like behaviour , any estimated value of ℜ 0 must fall within the interval 273 ( 1 , ∞ ) . It then logically follows that its inverse ( ℜ − 1 0 ) spans over the range ( 0 , 1 ) . This transformation permits 274 the inference algorithm to operate in a much smaller parameter space , which enhances sampling efficiency . 275 We subsequently incorporate the redefined components ( β and γ ) into the SE i I j R framework to produce 276 an alternative set of four candidate models with three unknowns : ℜ − 1 0 , ρ and I 10 . Similarly as before , we 277 estimate the posterior distribution for each candidate fitted to an incidence report . The reader can find 278 the complete set results in the electronic supplementary material S2 § 3 . These results once more highlight 279 the intrinsic symmetry of SEIR formulations . Specifically , provided there is an adequate configuration , any 280 candidate structure can accurately match the observed incidence despite differences in the infectious period 281 distribution . Nevertheless , this alternative parameterisation exhibits a distinctive and crucial feature : the 282 estimation of ℜ 0 is less sensitive to the assumed distribution of the infectious delay . To support this claim , 283 we present in Fig 5 the results of fitting the four alternative candidates to four incidence reports of dissimilar 284 origin . Here , it can be seen that all candidates recover ( via 95 % credible intervals ) the underlying true ℜ 0 , 285 notwithstanding the origin of the data or the fitting model . 286 Recovering the underlying ℜ 0 is not exclusive to this sample of four datasets but is generalised across the 80 287 high - fidelity D 1 j datasets . To summarise this insight , we borrow a concept from the frequentist tradition . 288 Such a concept known as coverage [ 59 ] means that if one collects a large number of samples from the same 289 process and constructs the corresponding confidence intervals , then a certain percentage of the intervals will 290 contain or cover the true parameter . This percentage is given by the confidence level . For instance , if one 291 fits a model to 100 datasets and estimates an equal number of confidence intervals at the 95 % significance 292 level , then 95 of those intervals will cover the true value . Admittedly , it is implicitly assumed that our 293 95 % credible intervals ( obtained from posterior distributions ) are proportional to 95 % confidence intervals . 294 Indeed , estimated intervals for ℜ 0 and ρ conform to this concept ( see electronic supplementary material 295 S2 § 3 . 3 ) , where minor deviations are justified by the fact that coverage is defined asymptotically ( infinite 296 measurements ) . However , asymptotics does not account for the large deviance observed in the estimates of 297 I 0 . We explain this inconsistency in the section below where I 0 becomes more prominent . 298 To conclude this section , we report the analysis of the low - fidelity datasets ( right column in Fig 2 ) . The 299 reader can find the results in the electronic supplementary material S3 . Overall , we obtain similar insights 300 in comparison to those derived from the high - fidelity datasets . In the absence of structural differences , it 301 is unsurprising that the effect of larger noise in the signal ( overdispersion ) results in greater uncertainty in 302 parameter estimates . This decrease in precision ( wider credible intervals ) can obscure or accentuate features 303 of the inference process . On the one hand , overdispersion masks biases in estimates . For instance , noisier 304 measurements cause I 0 estimates from the alternative parameterisation to conform to the expected coverage , 305 which should not occur based on the results obtained from the high - fidelity datasets . On the other hand , 306 overdispersion exacerbates identifiability issues . Under the four - unknown parameterisation , some ℜ 0 estimates 307 reach values up to 40 . This result is a reminder that choosing an adequate number of unknowns is not a 308 trivial decision . Setting more unknowns than the data can tolerate renders models unidentifiable . In this 309 context , unidentifiability occurs because the incidence data does not provide enough information to update 310 the prior distribution of γ . As discussed above , many values of γ are consistent with the observed incidence , 311 an insight that holds for both levels of data fidelity . Finally , we note that overdispersion estimates are robust 312 to the choice of the infectious period distribution . 313 10 A preprint - July 10 , 2023 M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 True model : D 11 True model : D 12 True model : D 13 True model : D 14 2 . 4 2 . 5 2 . 6 2 . 4 2 . 5 2 . 6 2 . 4 2 . 5 2 . 6 2 . 4 2 . 5 2 . 6 Basic reproduction number ( ℜ 0 ) Error bars : Estimates from M 1j fitting instances Vertical line : True value j : # of stages in the infectious class ( I ) D ⁱ ʲ : Data generator ' s distribution M ⁱ ʲ : Fitting model ' s distribution Figure 5 : Inference results obtained from the three - unknown alternative parameterisation . This plot compares estimates for the basic reproduction number obtained from fitting four candidate models to four incidence reports . Error bars correspond to 95 % credible intervals , and the vertical line denotes the true value . 3 . 4 Misspecifying the latent period distribution 314 Thus far , we have conducted the inference process assuming that the latent period distribution ( i ) is known . 315 Lifting this constraint would strain our computational resources , producing a four - fold increase in the pool of 316 candidates fitting a single report ( assuming i , j ∈ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } ) . Instead of undertaking such costly exploration , 317 one could leverage the fact that the mean generation time depends solely on the mean latent period rather than 318 its particular distribution ( Eq 5 ) . To test this idea , we compare the estimates obtained from candidate models 319 with the right and wrong latent period distribution . We illustrate this process with the 80 D 3 j low - fidelity 320 ( ϕ − 1 = 1 / 3 ) datasets . For each dataset , we fit eight candidates M ij from the traditional three - unknown 321 parameterisation , where the latent period distribution can take the wrong ( i = 1 ) and the right ( i = 3 ) 322 values , and the infectious period distribution varies as before , namely , j ∈ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } . The reader can find the 323 complete results in the electronic supplementary material S5 . 324 To facilitate the presentation of the results , we first focus on candidates M 13 and M 33 fitting one D 33 325 incidence report . Fig 6A shows that both models predict similar , although not identical , latent incidence 326 dynamics . Further inspection reveals that the slight difference in the predicted incidence due to dissimilar 327 latent period distributions does not lead to variation in ℜ 0 estimates . To corroborate this assessment , we 328 expand the analysis to the eight candidates matching the same incidence report . The right - hand side of 329 Fig 6B shows that ℜ 0 estimates are sensitive to variation in the structure of the infectious period but are 330 indifferent to the latent period distribution . In compliance with the literature , the more dispersed latent 331 period ( i = 1 ) leads to an earlier incidence peak compared to the tighter distribution ( i = 3 ) in the context of 332 identical ℜ 0 . 333 Nevertheless , the mechanism that enables models with heterogeneous distributions to produce analogous 334 incidence dynamics remains unexplained . The left - hand side of Fig 6B , which displays I 0 estimates , provides 335 the first hint . This plot shows that instances with the wrong latent period distribution ( M 1 j ) systematically 336 underestimate ( via 95 % credible intervals ) the actual value ( vertical line ) . To explain this phenomenon , we 337 draw on a broader view of the posterior distribution . It is commonplace to restrict inference analyses to one 338 parameter at a time ( i . e . marginal distributions ) , neglecting the information provided by the full posterior 339 distribution . To redress this shortcoming , we visualise the full distribution via pair plots . Specifically , Fig 6C 340 corresponds to the summary of the posterior distribution obtained from fitting M 13 to one D 33 incidence 341 report . The upper triangular elements of this plot indicate that the three estimated parameters are strongly 342 correlated . Especially β and I 0 , or more compellingly , ℜ 0 and I 0 . Recall that the basic reproduction number 343 is directly proportional to β . Therefore , although the mean generation time determines which ℜ 0 corresponds 344 to the observed incidence , I 0 ( and ρ to a lesser extent ) regulates the flexibility of ℜ 0 to reach such a desired 345 value . Interestingly , I 0 provides such a degree of flexibility that unrealistic adjustments in its estimates allow 346 11 A preprint - July 10 , 2023 M 13 ( wrong latent period distribution ) M 33 ( right latent period distribution ) 0 20 40 0 20 40 0 200 400 600 Days La t en t i n c i den c e ( x ) Points : Dataset obtained from SE³I³R ( D³³ ) Lines : Simulations from two M ij instances ﬁ tted to one D³³ dataset A M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 M 31 M 32 M 33 M 34 M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 M 31 M 32 M 33 M 34 I 0 ℜ 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 50 2 . 75 3 . 00 Value Vertical lines : Values used to configure the SE³I³R ( D³³ ) data generator Error bars : Estimates from M ij instances fitted to one D³³ dataset B 0 . 58 * * * - 0 . 92 * * * - 0 . 51 * * * 0 . 01 - 0 . 02 0 . 04 * β ρ I 0 φ − 1 β ρ I 0 φ − 1 1 . 11 . 21 . 31 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 00 . 51 . 01 . 5 0 . 250 . 50 0 250 500 750 0 . 6 0 . 8 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 M 13 instance fitted to one D 33 dataset C 0 . 61 * * * - 0 . 92 * * * - 0 . 56 * * * 0 0 0 . 01 β ρ I 0 φ − 1 β ρ I 0 φ − 1 1 . 11 . 21 . 31 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 2 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 300 600 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 2 3 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 M 33 instance fitted to one D 33 dataset D Figure 6 : Comparing estimates from candidates models with the wrong and correct distributions of the latent period .

Notice that the only discernible difference between Figs 6C and 6D 347 ( M 33 fitted to D 33 ) is seen in the marginal distributions of I 0 . In fact , this phenomenon explains the failure 348 of the alternative parameterisation to recover the true value of I 0 . 349 In view of these symmetries , it is not unreasonable to expect that candidates from the four - unknown and the 350 alternative parameterisations , too , are indifferent to the latent period distribution once I 0 and ρ correct for any 351 misspecification . To verify this premise , we fit the parameterisations mentioned above to the D 3 j low - fidelity 352 incidence reports . As anticipated , the inference results indicate that the four - unknown parameterisation ( S5 353 § 2 ) uncover the linear association between τ and ρ due to the unidentifiability of γ . Likewise , the alternative 354 parameterisation ( S5 § 3 ) recovers the true ℜ 0 irrespective of the formulation of the epidemiological delays . 355 Furthermore , we replicate these results using the D 3 j high - fidelity datasets ( see electronic supplementary 356 information S4 ) . 357 3 . 5 Sensitivity analysis 358 So far , model candidates have been amalgamated with the appropriate measurement component . In this 359 section , we explore the implications that can arise from ignoring overdispersion . That is , equipping model 360 candidates with a Poisson measurement component . We perform such exploration by inferring ℜ 0 from M 1 j 361 candidates ( alternative parameterisation ) fitted to the D 3 j low - fidelity datasets discussed in the previous 362 section . As expected , the results indicate that employing the Poisson distribution ( see S5 § 4 ) leads to 363 overconfident ( too precise ) and biased ( inaccurate ) estimates in the context of overdispersion . We observe 364 these features with narrow uncertainty intervals that do not cover the true value . This result implies that 365 the wrong choice of the measurement component can offset any gains in accuracy due to the alternative 366 parameterisation . 367 On the other hand , the synthetic data used for the analysis presented in the previous sections stems from 368 models configured to identical ℜ 0 and similar mean generation times ( variation due to the infectious period 369 distribution ) . Naturally , one wonders whether the usefulness of the alternative parameterisation holds in 370 other conditions . To answer this question , we repeat the workflow described in this paper for additional 371 scenarios of τ and ℜ 0 . For simplicity , we restrict this sensitivity analysis to datasets derived from models 372 with an exponentially - distributed latent period ( D 1 j ) . Additionally , we equip the fitting candidates with the 373 appropriate measurement component . The complete set of results is presented in the electronic supplementary 374 information S6 . We present these results in terms of scenarios ( Table 1 ) . For instance , the base case scenario , 375 Scenario 1 , corresponds to data generated from SE i I j R configured to ℜ 0 = 2 . 5 and τ e = 4 ( results presented 376 in Section 3 . 3 ) , where τ e serves as a scenario identifier and denotes the mean generation time obtained from 377 an exponentially - distributed infectious period ( j = 1 ) . 378 For Scenario 2 , we increase the reference mean generation time ( τ e = 8 ) , while keeping ℜ 0 at 2 . 5 . First , we 379 focus on the high - fidelity datasets . Overall , the greater the divergence between the fitting model’s infectious 380 period distribution and the distribution that generated the data , the greater the loss in accuracy . Namely , 381 lower coverage . To provide an example , the 95 % credible intervals constructed from M 14 candidates fitting D 11 382 incidence reports only attain coverage of 30 % for ℜ 0 . Closer inspection , though , reveals that such accuracy 383 loss is more statistical than practical . To support this statement , we calculate the average relative difference 384 between the actual and estimated ℜ 0 , finding that misspecification of the infectious period distribution leads 385 to a maximum average relative error of 2 % . In contrast , we would obtain discrepancies up to 15 % if we 386 adopted the traditional approach . Simply put , it is costlier to misspecify the mean generation time than the 387 mean infectious period . Furthermore , such slight differences in the alternative parameterisation are erased by 388 overdispersion . That is , overdispersion masks minor misspecification in the process component . Moreover , in 389 Scenario 3 ( ℜ 0 = 2 . 5 , τ e = 13 ) , we observe that further increasing of the mean generation time does not lead 390 13 A preprint - July 10 , 2023 to significant drops in the coverage of ℜ 0 under both levels of data fidelity . In a nutshell , it is reasonable to 391 suggest that the alternative parameterisation is robust to various levels of the mean generation time . 392 Conversely , we cannot maintain the same assertion for various values of ℜ 0 . Indeed , Fig 4C provided 393 the first hint . This plot shows that the straight lines do not overlap as ℜ 0 reaches relatively high values . 394 Consequently , in scenarios 4 ( ℜ 0 = 9 , τ e = 4 ) and 5 ( ℜ 0 = 17 , τ e = 4 ) , we test the implications of larger 395 transmissibility levels . The results indicate that as we increase the underlying ℜ 0 for generating the data , the 396 equivalency among fitting models dissipates and misspecification in the infectious period distribution leads to 397 biased estimates of ℜ 0 . The size of such bias is proportional to the misspecification of the infectious period 398 and the underlying ℜ 0 . This feature is primarily seen in the estimates derived from high - fidelity datasets , 399 where coverage levels are low , and the average relative error between actual and estimated values cannot be 400 overlooked . However , when we examine the posterior distributions obtained from fitting the low - fidelity data , 401 it is seen that , once again , overdispersion masks misspecification in the process component , as evidenced 402 by the high coverage levels . This is not to say that overdispersion is a desired feature in the data , but 403 rather to emphasise that its presence hinders the attainment of precise estimates . Undoubtedly , having 404 this understanding is of practical importance , given that it allows us to discern the necessary effort in data 405 collection and model improvement . 406 4 Application to Influenza A 407 Leveraging the knowledge gained from the synthetic data , the last step in this work consists of exploiting 408 the relationship between the basic reproduction number and the mean generation time to update the ℜ 0 409 estimate of an outbreak of the 1918 influenza pandemic . The reader can find the full set of results in the 410 electronic supplementary information S7 . In particular , we focus on an outbreak that occurred in the city 411 of Cumberland ( Maryland ) during the autumn of 1918 , for which the U . S . Public Health Service organised 412 special surveys [ 60 ] to determine the proportion of the population infected . Previous studies [ 12 , 22 ] employed 413 the default heuristic of adopting an SEIR with exponentially - distributed epidemiological delays whose means 414 were configured to values reported in the literature . Moreover , in these studies , the SEIR was coupled 415 with the Poisson distribution resulting in a 95 % CI [ 2 . 5 – 2 . 6 ] for ℜ 0 . However , adopting a more realistic 416 measurement component , such as the Negative Binomial distribution , produces lower and wider estimates : 417 95 % CI [ 2 . 2 , 2 . 4 ] . Further , if we jettison the assumption of an exponentially - distributed infectious period for 418 a more realistic distribution , such as the gamma distribution , we even obtain lower estimates . For instance , a 419 gamma - distributed infectious period with four stages ( SEI 4 R ) returns a 95 % CI of [ 2 . 0 , 2 . 2 ] . As noted earlier , 420 the estimates obtained from this default heuristic or traditional approach are sensitive to the uncertainty in 421 the infectious period distribution . On the contrary , when we fix the mean generation time in the SEI j R 422 ( alternative parameterisation ) to a value ( 2 . 85 days ) obtained from the literature [ 5 , 61 ] , we derive nearly 423 identical ℜ 0 estimates ( 95 % CI [ 2 . 0 , 2 . 1 ] ) regardless of the infectious period distribution ( Fig 7 ) . Notice that 424 this estimate is similar to that obtained from the SEI 4 R , bolstering the fact that the actual infectious period 425 is far from being exponentially distributed . 426 5 Conclusion 427 The misspecification of various assumptions within the SEIR framework can negatively impact the estimation 428 of ℜ 0 . In recognition of this risk , we ran a simulation study comprised of approximately 1000 synthetic 429 datasets and 8000 model fits , whereby we identified the relative influence of some of those assumptions . 430 Specifically , we found that fixing the mean generation time to a reliable estimate is of paramount importance . 431 In contrast , one can be more lenient on the specification of the latent period distribution and the mean 432 infectious period provided that other estimated parameters ( I 0 and ρ ) redress the misspecification . We 433 leveraged this knowledge to formulate an alternative parameterisation that is more robust to the uncertainty 434 of the epidemiological delays . However , there is a caveat with this alternative formulation . Although it 435 exploits a local symmetry ( incidence dynamics ) of the SEIR framework , such symmetry does not extend to 436 the other states of the system . Therefore , the usefulness of the alternative parameterisation is confined to 437 the estimation of ℜ 0 , and it is not a substitute for other kinds of analyses . For instance , if , on the contrary , 438 our variable of interest were I 0 , we would obtain unreliable estimates . Furthermore , the alternative SEIR 439 with exponentially - distributed delays will be as overoptimistic as its traditional counterpart in predicting 440 the critical vaccination proportion or the effectiveness of an imperfect VIH treatment in the context of 441 within - host dynamics [ 56 ] . Therefore , the alternative parameterisation is a mitigation strategy in the absence 442 of complete information . Furthermore , its usefulness is abated by highly transmissible pathogens ( Section 443 14 A preprint - July 10 , 2023 M 11 M 14 0 25 50 75 0 25 50 75 0 50 100 150 Days I n c i den c e [ C a s e s / da y ] Points : Cumberland ' s data Line , ribbon , error bars : Estimates from M 1j instances ﬁ tted to Cumberland ' s incidence Fitted model instances stem from the alternative parameterisation M 11 M 12 M 13 M 14 1 . 8 2 . 0 2 . 2 ℜ 0 Figure 7 : Application of the three - unknown alternative parameterisation .

Nevertheless , biases in the estimates due to large ℜ 0 are only detected with high - fidelity data . That is , 444 data with little or no overdispersion . 445 Despite the significant computational effort of simulation analyses , a single study cannot offer overarching 446 statements . Further work is required to test the validity of these insights in stricter or more elaborated 447 contexts . For instance , we assumed the complete availability of the incidence time - series throughout this 448 study . This assumption restricts the validity of the approach to retrospective analyses . However , other 449 situations exist where only fewer incidence measurements are available to the modellers , such as the early 450 phase of a pandemic response . Hence , it remains to be seen the effect of various levels of data availability on 451 the performance of the suggested approach . Furthermore , for simplicity , we ignored age - related effects in 452 the dynamics of the infectious disease as well as process stochasticity ( demographic and environmental ) and 453 time - varying contact rates . We expect that future research builds on the findings provided by this study and 454 addresses the aforementioned challenges to construct ever more reliable inference approaches . 455 Acknowledgement 456 The project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme 457 under grant agreement No 883285 .
