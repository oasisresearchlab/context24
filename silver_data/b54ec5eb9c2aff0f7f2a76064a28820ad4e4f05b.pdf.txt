It has been suggested that protein clustering and lipid reorganization determine toxin uptake into cells . Here , we elucidated the molecular requirements for STxB induced Gb 3 clustering and for the proposed lipid reorganization in planar membranes . The influence of binding site III of the B - subunit as well as the Gb 3 lipid structure was investigated by means of high resolution methods such as fluorescence and scanning force microscopy . STxB was found to form protein clusters on homogenous 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) / cholesterol / Gb 3 ( 65 : 30 : 5 ) bilayers . In contrast , membranes composed of DOPC / cholesterol / sphingomyelin / Gb 3 ( 40 : 35 : 20 : 5 ) phase separate into a liquid ordered and liquid disordered phase . Dependent on the fatty acid composition of Gb 3 , STxB - Gb 3 complexes organize within the liquid ordered phase upon protein binding . Our findings suggest that STxB is capable of forming a new membrane phase that is characterized by lipid compaction . The significance of this finding is discussed in the context of Shiga toxin - induced formation of endocytic membrane invaginations .

STx consists of a hexameric assembly comprising a single catalytically active A - subunit possessing rRNA - specific N - glycosidase activity and a B - subunit ( STxB ) , a pentamer of identical fragments , which is responsible for the toxin binding to the plasma membrane of the host cell [ 1 ] . This homopentameric STxB can bind up to 15 molecules of the plasma membrane - embedded neutral receptor globotriaosylceramide ( Gb 3 ) [ 2 , 3 ] and allows the intracellular transport of the holotoxin and the delivery of the monomeric A - subunit into the cytosol leading to the inhibition of protein biosynthesis [ 4 ] . Once bound to the plasma membrane , it has been shown that STx can be internalized in a clathrin - and caveolae - independent process [ 5 – 8 ] , and a recent study demonstrates that the lipids themselves contribute significantly to the earliest steps of toxin uptake into cells , that is , the formation of membrane invaginations [ 9 ] . These membrane invaginations appear to be concomitant with membrane reorganization , as deduced from experiments using the polarization sensitive membrane dye Laurdan on cells [ 9 ] . In particular , STxB binds with high apparent affinity to Gb 3 resulting in the formation of dynamic STxB clusters in a process that imposes negative curvature on the membrane [ 9 , 10 ] . Coarse grained membrane simulations have demonstrated that curvature - mediated interactions can lead to protein clustering and the formation of invaginations [ 11 ] . In the case of STxB , the exact mechanism , by which local curvature is induced , still has not been described , even if it has been suggested , based on theoretical considerations that local lipid compaction might be the driving force [ 9 ] . Three different Gb 3 binding sites ( I , II , and III ) are found on each of the five B - fragments that constitute one homopentameric STxB subunit , and it is known that they contribute differently to the binding of STxB to cells . While a mutation in binding site I ( D17E - STxB ) decreases the binding affinity to cells by a factor of about three [ 12 ] , a mutation in binding site III ( W34A - STxB ) does not . However , despite the same binding affinity , the latter mutant shows a strongly reduced binding capacity suggesting that binding site III serves as a recognition element for additional Gb 3 molecules after the protein has been bound [ 12 ] . The recruitment of Gb 3 molecules underneath STxB via binding site III may then result in the formation of Gb 3 clusters and membrane thickening as proposed by Ling et al . [ 3 ] . This , in turn , suggests that the molecular structure of Gb 3 , i . e . the composition of the fatty acids , which determines the localization of the lipids in phase separated lipid bilayers [ 13 , 14 ] contributes considerably to Gb 3 cluster formation . By molecular modeling , Nyholm et al . [ 15 ] observed an influence of the fatty acid composition on the conformation and position of the Gb 3 head group at the membrane interface , which directly impacts the STxB binding affinity . This is further PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 July 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e6238 corroborated by the finding that the binding affinity of STxB to bilayers composed of phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) and Gb 3 increases if the fatty acid chain length of PC decreases , which exposes the head group of Gb 3 more into the aqueous phase [ 16 ] . Of note , the binding affinity of STxB to Gb 3 was found to be larger if the receptor lipid was extracted from tissue , i . e . a mixture of Gb 3 molecules was presented , compared to neat synthetic Gb 3 molecules [ 17 ] . Furthermore , not only a higher binding affinity but also a larger binding capacity was found if a mixture of Gb 3 lipids varying in the fatty acid composition was used for STxB binding studies , when compared to single Gb 3 species [ 18 ] . These studies demonstrate a direct link between lipid structure and Shiga toxin interaction with cell membranes . The functional conse - quences of these differences have not yet been addressed directly . In this study , we analyzed the molecular requirements for STxB - induced Gb 3 clustering and for the previously suggested lipid reorganization in planar membranes . The influence of binding site III of the protein as well as of the Gb 3 lipid structure on the lateral organization of STxB and the membrane was investigated by means of high resolution methods such as fluorescence and scanning force microscopy . Results Interaction of STxB with DOPC / cholesterol / Gb 3 bilayers To investigate the formation of membrane invaginations induced by STxB binding , first a lipid mixture composed of 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) and cholesterol was chosen , doped with 5 mol % of purified porcine globotriaosylceramide ( porcine Gb 3 ) . The cholesterol content was adjusted to 30 mol % in accordance with its typical abundance in the plasma membrane of eukaryotic animal cells . The specific binding of Cy3 - labeled STxB to DOPC / cholesterol / porcine Gb 3 ( 65 : 30 : 5 ) giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs , 10 – 30 m m in diameter ) doped with 1 mol % Bodipy - PC at room temperature results in the formation of tubular membrane invaginations containing STxB ( red fluorescence ) and membrane components ( green fluorescence ) ( Figure 1A ) similar to what has been observed in experiments performed at 37 u C [ 9 ] . To elucidate protein - and lipid reorganization processes with high lateral resolution upon STxB binding , we made use of fluorescence and scanning force microscopy ( SFM ) on planar solid supported membranes ( SSMs ) . As membrane bending is con - strained in SSMs , the observed protein distribution is not influenced by membrane deformation . The topography of planar membranes composed of DOPC / cholesterol / porcine Gb 3 ( 65 : 30 : 5 ) immobilized on atomically flat mica surfaces is featureless , i . e . no membrane domains are discernable ( Figure S1 ) , which is consistent with the homogeneous green Bodipy - PC fluorescence observed in GUVs ( data not shown ) . In rare cases , small holes were identified as membrane defects confirming the formation of a bilayer on the surface . Binding of Cy3 - labeled STxB results in a rather homogeneous fluorescence on the membrane , which is the result of high protein coverage of membrane bound STxB ( Figure 2A ) . Only very rarely , black areas were found , which are assigned to membrane defects as proven by SFM ( data not shown ) , while small white spots are attributed to larger protein aggregates attached to the surface . If the specific receptor Gb 3 is not present in the membrane , very week fluorescence was detected as a result of non - specific protein binding , mainly localized in membrane defects . By means of SFM , the lateral organization of membrane - bound protein was visualized showing micrometer - sized , sometimes Figure 1 . STxB binding to GUVs . ( A ) GUVs are composed of DOPC / cholesterol / porcine Gb 3 ( 65 : 30 : 5 ) doped with 1 mol % Bodipy - PC .

A detailed analysis of the protein clusters reveals an overall protein coverage of about 30 – 60 % , while the height difference between membrane and protein turned out to be ( 2 . 2 6 0 . 4 ) nm ( n = 35 , Figure 2C ) . To elucidate the influence of binding site III of STxB on the distribution of the protein on the membrane , the binding behavior of a STxB variant , in which the Gb 3 binding site III is inactivated by mutagenesis ( W34A - STxB ) , was analyzed by fluorescence and scanning force microscopy . Even though the mutant protein still binds to membranes composed of DOPC / cholesterol / porcine Gb 3 ( 65 : 30 : 5 ) as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 2D ) , the overall protein cluster size appears to be smaller ( Figure 2E ) . As the molecular dimensions of the mutant protein are identical to those of the wild - type protein , the height difference between membrane and protein was expected to be the same . In contrast to this prediction , we found that the height difference between membrane and protein was significantly smaller , as a value of ( 1 . 6 6 0 . 3 ) nm ( n = 12 ) was determined ( Figure 2F ) . These results demonstrate how the protein’s Gb 3 binding capability modifies the overall membrane structure at STxB domains . Interaction of STxB with DOPC / sphingomyelin / cholesterol / Gb 3 bilayers In contrast to the lipid mixture discussed in the previous section , GUV membranes composed of a lipid raft mixture , namely DOPC / sphingomyelin / cholesterol / porcine Gb 3 ( 41 : 41 : 13 : 5 ) doped with 1 mol % Bodipy - PC was used . These membranes are phase separated at room temperature as concluded from the observed inhomogeneous Bodipy - PC fluorescence ( data not shown ) . The fluorophore is excluded from the liquid ordered ( l o - ) phase , while it is well soluble in the liquid disordered ( l d - ) phase mainly composed of DOPC . The dark l o - phase is largely enriched in sphingomyelin , and cholesterol [ 19 – 21 ] . Cy3 - labeled STxB is found at the l o - phase ( Figure 1B ) implying the preferential localization of porcine Gb 3 in the l o - phase after protein binding . Interestingly , STxB fluorescence found at the border of the l o - and l d - phase is very faint , which might be a result of a preferential STxB clustering within the l o - domains ( Figure 1B , overlay , vesicle bottom ) . Tubule formation was , however , not observed with this lipid composition after protein binding but only shallow invaginations , even after vesicle deflation . To elucidate this observation in more detail , planar bilayers composed of DOPC / sphingomyelin / cholesterol / porcine Gb 3 ( 40 : 35 : 20 : 5 ) were analyzed by SFM , also showing the coexistence of two lipid phases ( Figure 3A ) . The lower phase is assigned to the l d - phase enriched in DOPC , while the l o - phase exhibits a membrane thickness , which is ( 0 . 7 6 0 . 2 ) nm ( n = 46 ) larger than the l d - phase as a result of a more ordered lipid packing of sphingomyelin , and cholesterol ( Figure 3D ) , as reported previously [ 22 – 25 ] . Addition of Cy3 - labeled STxB results in an inhomogeneous protein fluorescence ( Figure 3B ) . A correlation of this fluorescence with SFM images allowed us to resolve the lateral protein distribution and membrane structure in more detail . Three different heights were found in the SFM topography image ( Figure 3C ) . The lowermost structures are attributed to the l d - phase and correspond to the dark areas in the fluorescence image with respect to form , distribution and number . As no protein fluorescence is emitted from those areas , it is concluded that STxB does not bind to the l d - phase . The areas of bright protein fluorescence are a result of Cy3 - labeled STxB bound to the liquid ordered phase ( Figure 3B ) . By means of SFM imaging ( Figure 3C ) fractal STxB clusters bound to porcine Gb 3 , which are located in Figure 2 .

Only small areas in the l o - phase can be identified , on which no protein has been bound to , which might be explained by a local depletion of the receptor lipid Gb 3 . The height difference between the lowermost ( l d - phase ) and the observed medium height level ( l o - phase without protein ) was determined by line analysis , confirming the expected height difference of 0 . 6 nm between l d - and l o - phase prior to protein addition [ 22 – 25 ] . We could not observe any preferential binding of the protein to the interface region of l o - and l d - phase , which makes a clear distinction of these areas possible . From areas , where only the l o - phase and the protein submonolayer were present , we determined the height difference between adsorbed STxB and the l o - phase rather accurately to a value of ( 2 . 2 6 0 . 2 ) nm ( n = 26 ) by histogram analysis ( Figure S2 ) . A histogram of an area that contains all three different heights ( l o - phase , l d - phase , and protein layer ) reproduces the obtained height differences , but it is more difficult to unambiguously separate them ( Figure 3E ) . Lipid reorganization in planar bilayers by STxB binding It is assumed that STxB binding to the l o - phase of DOPC / sphingomyelin / cholesterol / porcine Gb 3 ( 40 : 35 : 20 : 5 ) membranes results in lipid reorganization . To prove this hypothesis , planar membranes were labeled with two different fluorescent lipids . 0 . 1 mol % of DOPC were replaced by TexasRed DHPE , which is preferentially localized in the l d - phase , while further 0 . 2 mol % DOPC were substituted by perylene . Figure 4A / C ( green color ) show perylene fluorescence images prior to the addition of STxB . Large fluorescently labeled areas are discernable , with dark domains in between , where the perylene fluorophore is excluded . The black areas in the perylene fluorescence appear bright in the TexasRed DHPE fluorescence images ( Figure 4B / C , red color ) confirming that the perylene fluorophore is mainly localized in the l o - phase . Small white spots are assigned to residual vesicles adsorbed on the bilayer . After protein incubation , the appearance of the fluorescence images has changed considerably . Rather circular domains up to 10 m m in diameter are visible in the TexasRed DHPE fluorescence ( Figure 4E / F , red color ) assigning the l d - phase . To quantify this , the circularity of the l d - domains was determined , which increases from 0 . 66 6 0 . 21 to 0 . 81 6 0 . 17 after protein binding . The same circularity of the l d - domains ( 0 . 83 6 0 . 15 ) was found by analyzing the Cy3 - fluorescence image after STxB binding ( Figure 3B ) . Of note , also the perylene fluorophore is now preferentially located in the l d - phase ( Figure 4D / F , green color ) indicating that the partition of the perylene fluorophore between the l o - and l d - phase has changed upon STxB binding . This observation is further supported by an overlay image showing both , the fluorescence of Cy3 - labeled STxB and perylene , which demonstrates that the protein is localized at the l o - phase , from which the perylene fluorophore is excluded ( Figure 5A ) . We suggest that a tighter packing of the lipids in the l o - phase , as a result of the formation of STxB - Gb 3 complexes , leads to the exclusion of the perylene fluorophore from this lipid phase . This tighter lipid packing in the l o - phase is also reflected in the fraction area of l o - phase in the bilayer , which decreases from 72 % prior to protein binding to 63 % after protein adsorption as determined by pixel analysis of the fluorescence images ( see Figure 4B / E ) . Furthermore , SFM images ( Figure 4C / F , insets ) reveal that , after STxB has been bound , small l o - domains appear within the l d - domains , which could not be resolved by fluorescence microscopy . As Gb 3 appears to be the major player for lipid reorganization and compaction , we further elucidated the impact of the packing Figure 3 .

Compared to membranes doped with porcine Gb 3 ( Figure 5A ) , the protein appears rather homogeneously distributed on Gb 3 ( 22 : 1 13 ) doped bilayers ( Figure 5B ) , while an unambiguous separation of perylene and Cy3 - labeled protein fluorescence is observed for Gb 3 ( 22 : 0 ) ( Figure 5C ) containing membranes . These results obtained on phase - separated planar supported membranes demonstrate the strong influence of the fatty acid side chain on the protein distribution and on cluster formation . STxB binding to lipid monolayer systems By using planar lipid monolayers at the air / water interface , a versatile system is available , which enabled us to monitor changes in membrane domains and the formation of lipid phases at a defined surface pressure . A lipid mixture composed of DOPC doped with 1 mol % Bodipy - PC / sphingomyelin / cholesterol / por - cine Gb 3 ( 40 : 35 : 20 : 5 ) was spread on a PBS buffered subphase , the monolayer compressed to a surface pressure of 30 mN m 2 1 ( Figure S3 ) and the phase behavior analyzed by fluorescence microscopy . At 30 mN m 2 1 , coexistence of two lipid phases was observed . Round as well as elongated domains were discernable , Figure 4 .

Bodipy - PC is localized in the surrounding l d - phase mostly composed of DOPC . Cy3 - labeled STxB was injected into the subphase , which enabled us to monitor the Bodipy - PC and Cy3 - fluorescence quasi - simultaneously after the protein had been bound to the monolayer . After protein binding , the Bodipy - PC fluorescence images show rather irregu - larly shaped dark l o - phase domains , which appear bright in the Cy3 - fluorescence indicating that the protein is solely adsorbed on the l o - phase domains ( Figure 6C ) . A detailed pixel analysis of the Bodipy - PC fluorescence images reveals that the overall area occupied by l o - phase does not change considerably upon protein binding . However , 30 minutes after protein addition , the number of l o - phase domains per monolayer area has increased from ( 330 6 70 ) mm 2 2 to ( 750 6 290 ) mm 2 2 , which is primarily a result of an increase in the number of small domains ( , 1000 m m 2 ) from 72 % to 94 % of all l o - phase domains . This result suggests that STxB binding to the monolayer induces new l o - phase domains similar to what has been observed in bilayers ( compare Figure 4C / F , insets ) . Surprisingly , darker areas become discernable within the larger l o - phase domains ( Figure 6B ) after protein binding . The slight change in fluorescence intensity can be more easily visualized by the intensity profile depicted in Figure 6D . This finding implies lipid compaction within the existing l o - phase , leading to a strong exclusion of the Bodipy - PC fluorophore . The same experiment was performed using the mutant W34A - STxB lacking binding site III . While Cy3 - labeled protein binding to the l o - phase was observed ( Figure 7A ) , the total number of domains per monolayer area decreased from ( 430 6 140 ) mm 2 2 prior protein addition to ( 320 6 120 ) mm 2 2 30 minutes after STxB binding . Moreover , darker areas within the l o - phase were not found ( Figure 7B ) . To elucidate whether STxB is indeed capable of inducing new membrane domains , we started from a non - phase separated lipid monolayer and investigated , whether dark domains are induced upon binding of STxB . A monolayer composed of DOPC doped with 1 mol % Bodipy - PC / sphingomyelin / cholesterol / porcine Gb 3 ( 65 : 10 : 20 : 5 ) was spread at the air / water interface ( Figure S3 ) . Before protein binding , the monolayer does not show phase separation at a surface pressure of 10 – 35 mN m 2 1 as deduced from fluorescence images ( Figure 8A ) . However , after STxB binding , dark domains with a dendritic shape become discernable in the Bodipy - PC fluorescence images ( Figure 8B ) , which appear bright in the Cy3 - fluorescence images demonstrating that the protein has been bound to these newly formed irregularly shaped liquid ordered domains ( Figure 8C ) . These findings suggest that the protein is capable of forming l o - phase domains probably enriched in Gb 3 . The same experiment was performed with the mutant W34A - STxB and no formation of l o - phase domains was observed ( data not shown ) . Discussion Previously , it has been shown that Shiga toxin is able to form tubules and buds in cellular and artificial systems , which was discussed in terms of protein - lipid nanodomain formation [ 9 ] . Such domains might be a direct result of protein binding leading to receptor clustering [ 28 ] , which , in turn , can modulate the entire membrane organization . Here , we have shown that tubule formation in GUVs occurs not only at 37 u C but also at room temperature , if a DOPC / cholesterol / porcine Gb 3 ( 65 : 30 : 5 ) lipid mixture is used . In contrast , only shallow deformations are formed in phase separated GUV membranes composed of DOPC / sphingomyelin / cholesterol / porcine Gb 3 ( 41 : 41 : 13 : 5 ) with an inhomogeneous Cy3 - STxB fluorescence found at the border of the l o - and l d - phase suggesting STxB clustering within the l o - domains . In GUV experiments addressing cholera toxin binding to G M1 doped lipid bilayers , Baumgart et al . [ 20 ] were able to correlate the lipid domain composition and local membrane curvature proposing that these factors are important for membrane invagination processes . Figure 5 .

Surprisingly , we found a mean height of the protein clusters of 2 . 2 nm , even though the protein height as deduced from the crystal structure of STxB is expected to be only Figure 6 .

In general , protein heights determined by SFM are often under - estimated [ 32 ] because of the force applied by the tip and a non - perfect protein packing . Indeed , membrane bound W34A - STxB with the same molecular dimensions , but only two Gb 3 binding sites per monomer , exhibits a smaller height of 1 . 6 nm compared to that of the crystal structure as expected . Hence , we conclude that the observed 28 % height increase of the protein domains compared to those of W34A - STxB is a result of membrane thickening induced by the accumulation of Gb 3 owing to the occupation of binding site III of each STxB subunit after protein binding as proposed by Bast et al . [ 12 ] and Ling et al . [ 3 ] . A higher lipid packing density , as suggested by the perylene redistribution experiments ( see below ) in DOPC / sphingomyelin / cholesterol / Gb 3 ( 40 : 35 : 20 : 5 ) membranes ( Figure 4 and 5 ) might also contribute to this bilayer thickening . This composition phase separates forming a l o - and l d - phase , which is in good agreement with reported ternary phase diagrams of DOPC , cholesterol and sphingomyelin [ 33 ] . STxB solely binds to Gb 3 and is excluded from the l d - phase . Hence , it can be concluded that Gb 3 is located within the l o - phase after STxB has been bound . For G M1 , it has been reported that it is localized in the l o - phase of lipid monolayers composed of phosphatidylcholine , sphingomyelin and cholesterol [ 27 , 34 ] . Besides protein clustering , an unexpected observation is that STxB binding to a DOPC / sphingomyelin / cholesterol / Gb 3 ( 40 : 35 : 20 : 5 ) lipid mixture results in a redistribution of the fluorophore perylene from the l o - in the l d - phase . In GUV experiments , perylene was preferentially found in l o - phases in ternary lipid mixtures containing egg sphingomyelin , DOPC and cholesterol [ 20 ] . However , Baumgart et al . [ 35 ] reported that perylene does not show any favored localization in ternary mixtures containing brain sphingomyelin . Even though we used brain sphingomyelin , perylene is unambiguously localized in the l o - phase in solid supported membranes composed of sphingomyelin , DOPC and cholesterol before the addition of protein . After protein binding , the fluorophore is colocalized with TexasRed DHPE in the l d - phase . Following the idea that the protein generates a new membrane organization comprising STxB - Gb 3 complexes that are tightly packed , the fluorophore is excluded from this further compressed membrane phase and thus partitions into the l d - phase . This notion is in agreement with the increased height difference observed in the topography images shown in Figure 2 and 3 and the fact that the total area occupied by l o - phase is reduced by 10 % upon protein binding . In addition , the circularity of the l o - domains increases after protein addition , which might be a result of an increased line tension owing to the increased height difference between the l o - domains and the surrounding l d - phase membrane . Recently , Garcia - Sa´ez et al . [ 36 ] also showed that an increase in line tension induced by a hydrophobic mismatch in solid supported membranes leads to an increase in circularity of the membrane domains . We thus conclude that a lipid compaction in the l o - phase occurs , which is induced by the bound protein . We suggest that Gb 3 lipids compact upon STxB binding , leading to lipid reorganization within the membrane and eventually results in the formation of an additional membrane phase enriched in Gb 3 and STxB . Even though the lipid organization and the composition of this new phase is not yet fully understood , it is well conceivable that the packing parameter of Gb 3 might influence this lipid compaction and reorganization process , which was corroborated by fluorescence overlay exper - iments . Initially phase separated planar membranes containing Gb 3 with a long chain saturated fatty acid ( 22 : 0 ) demix in the presence of STxB similarly to what has been observed for membranes containing porcine Gb 3 , which is composed of 70 % saturated and 30 % unsaturated fatty acids . In contrast , STxB is rather homogeneously bound to membranes containing Gb 3 with a mono - unsaturated fatty acid ( 22 : 1 13 ) , which is less densely packed , and is not organized in macroscopic domains , from which perylene is excluded . The proposed lipid compaction was further supported by monolayer experiments at the air / water interface , demonstrating that new l o - phase domains are formed upon STxB binding and a denser lipid packing is induced within already existing liquid ordered phase domains . That the mutant W34A - STxB does not influence the phase behavior of the monolayer further suggests that Gb 3 clustering underneath STxB is presumably a prerequisite for the formation of l o - phase domains . Based on our current knowledge , we propose a model for protein binding and lipid reorganization as depicted in Figure 9 . First , STxB binds via the high affinity binding sites I and II to Gb 3 and forms protein clusters . Via binding site III , more Gb 3 molecules are recruited underneath the protein , which results in membrane thickening and a close packing of the lipids . As a result of the increased line tension ( red arrows ) the membrane domains become more circular ( A ) and fuse to larger domains ( B ) in case of planar supported membranes [ 9 , 37 , 38 ] . In case of free mem - branes , such lipid reorganization and compaction generated by Gb 3 clustering can result either in large membrane domains with the formation of only small buds ( see Figure 1B ) or , if no large phase separation occurs , it leads to bending of the membrane ( C ) if Figure 8 .

In conclusion , the presented results provide evidence for the STxB - induced formation of tightly packed membrane domains , whose intrinsic properties such as height mismatch and trans - bilayer stress may contribute to the driving forces required for the clathrin - independent plasma membrane invaginations in cells .

Giant unilamellar vesicles GUVs were prepared by the electroformation technique as previously described [ 9 , 40 ] . Lipids were dissolved in the appropriate ratio in chloroform at a total concentration of Figure 9 . Model of the binding modes of STxB to Gb 3 containing membranes . The organization of the lipids in the bottom leaflet of the bilayer is not given in detail .

GUVs with a typical diameter of 10 – 30 m m were grown in a sucrose solution adjusted to 300 mOsm . They were transferred into a chamber containing Cy3 - labeled STxB ( 200 nM ) in PBS buffer . Solid supported bilayers Bilayers were prepared on mica surfaces by means of vesicle spreading . Stock solutions of DOPC , sphingomyelin , cholesterol , TexasRed DHPE , and Bodipy - PC , respectively were prepared in chloroform , while Gb 3 was dissolved in chloroform / methanol ( 2 : 1 ) . Lipid films were formed at the bottom of glass test tubes under a stream of nitrogen at T = 55 u C , desiccated under vacuum at 55 u C for 3 h and stored at 4 u C . Multilamellar vesicles ( MLVs ) were obtained by allowing the lipid films to swell in buffer solution ( 20 mM TRIS / HCl , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM CaCl 2 , pH 7 . 4 ) for 20 min at 55 u C followed by vortexing three times for 30 sec every 5 min ( total lipid concentration : 0 . 3 mg ml 2 1 ) . MLVs were subsequently converted into large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) by extrusion using a mini extruder ( LiposoFast , Avestin , Ottawa , Canada ) supplied with a 50 nm polycarbonate membrane at 55 u C . The LUVs were deposited on a freshly cleaved mica plate fixed in an open Teflon chamber with a lipid concentration of 0 . 3 mg ml 2 1 in the presence of 10 mM Ca 2 + . After 1 h incubation at 55 u C , the mica surface was rinsed with PBS buffer ( 1 . 5 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 8 . 1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 136 . 9 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4 ) at room temperature . Either Cy3 - labeled or unlabeled STxB was added to the planar bilayer at room temperature . Non - and reversibly bound protein was removed after 1 hour by rinsing with PBS buffer . Lipid monolayers at the air / water interface STxB interaction with lipid monolayers at the air / water interface was investigated by means of a film balance equipped with a Wilhelmy system ( Riegler & Kirstein , Potsdam , Germany ) . To reduce the volume of the subphase after monolayer compression , a small trough with a total volume of about 6 ml was placed into the Teflon trough of the film balance . Lipid mixtures dissolved in chloroform / methanol were spread onto a PBS buffered subphase and the lipid film was equilibrated for 15 min . After the monolayer was compressed with a velocity of 4 . 7 mm 2 s 2 1 to a surface pressure of 30 mN m 2 1 , the total subphase volume was reduced by delimiting the inserted small trough with two Teflon pieces and the film was equilibrated for another 15 min . STxB with a final concentration of 60 nM was injected into the subphase without disturbance of the monolayer via an inlet port of the small trough . The lateral organization of the lipid monolayer doped with 1 mol % Bodipy - PC and the localization of Cy3 - labeled STxB was investigated by fluorescence microscopy , while the surface pressure was monitored simulta - neously . All measurements were performed at T = 20 u C . Fluorescence microscopy Fluorescence images of planar lipid monolayers and bilayers were obtained with an Axiotech Vario microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) equipped with an EC Epiplan - Neofluar 20 6 / 0 . 5 objective ( Zeiss ) and filter set 44 ( BP 475 / 40 , FT 500 , BP 530 / 50 , Zeiss ) for monolayer inspection and a water immersion objective Achroplan 40 6 / 0 . 8 W ( Zeiss ) for fluorescence analysis of solid supported bilayers . Filter set 45 ( BP 560 / 40 , FT585 , BP 630 / 75 , Zeiss ) was used for Cy3 - STxB and TexasRed DHPE fluorescence light detection and filter set 47 ( BP 436 / 20 , FT 455 , BP 480 / 40 , Zeiss ) for perylene fluorescence . Fluorescence images of GUVs were obtained at room temperature with a confocal microscope ( LSM 510 , Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) equipped with an oil immersion objective 63 6 PL APO HCX , 1 . 4 numerical aperture ( Zeiss ) . Scanning force microscopy Surface images of solid supported bilayers were obtained in an open Teflon fluid chamber using a JPK NanoWizard II scanning force microscope ( JPK Instruments , Berlin , Germany ) . Measure - ments were performed in PBS buffer in contact mode using microfabricated silicon tips with a typical resonance frequency of 10 kHz and a nominal spring constant of 0 . 03 N m 2 1 . Scan speed was adapted to the scan size and set between 0 . 6 and 2 Hz . Image resolution was 512 6 512 pixels . Height differences were extracted by pixel analysis of several SFM images with different image sizes .
