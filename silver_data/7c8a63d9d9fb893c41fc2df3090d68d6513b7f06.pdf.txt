Abstract Inhibitors of VEGF signaling can block angiogenesis and reduce tumor vascularity , but little is known about the reversibility of these changes after treatment ends . In the present study , regrowth of blood vessels in spontaneous RIP - Tag2 tumors and implanted Lewis lung carcinomas in mice was assessed after inhibition of VEGF receptor signaling by AG - 013736 or AG - 028262 for 7 days . Both agents caused loss of 50 % - 60 % of tumor vasculature . Empty sleeves of basement membrane were left behind . Pericytes also survived but had less alpha - SMA immunoreactivity . One day after drug withdrawal , endothelial sprouts grew into empty sleeves of basement membrane . Vessel patency and connection to the bloodstream followed close behind . By 7 days , tumors were fully revascularized , and the pericyte phenotype returned to baseline . Importantly , the regrown vasculature regressed as much during a second treatment as it did in the first . Inhibition of MMPs or targeting of type IV collagen cryptic sites by antibody HUIV26 did not eliminate the sleeves or slow revascularization . These results suggest that empty sleeves of basement membrane and accompanying pericytes provide a scaffold for rapid revascularization of tumors after removal of anti - VEGF therapy and highlight their importance as potential targets in cancer therapy .
