Olsson 2 , Matthew Hartley 2 , Caroline Dean 1 and Stefanie Rosa 1 * Abstract Background : Despite advances in other model organisms , there are currently no techniques to explore cell - to - cell variation and sub - cellular localization of RNA molecules at the single - cell level in plants . Results : Here we describe a method for imaging individual mRNA molecules in Arabidopsis thaliana root cells using multiple singly labeled oligonucleotide probes . We demonstrate detection of both mRNA and nascent transcripts of the housekeeping gene Protein Phosphatase 2A . Our image analysis pipeline also enables quantification of mRNAs that reveals the frequency distribution of transcripts per cell underlying the population mean . Conclusion : This method allows single molecule RNA in situ to be exploited as a powerful tool for studying gene regulation in plants .

Background Quantitative real - time PCR is commonly used to analyze plant gene expression , but this method lacks potentially important information relating to sub - cellular localiza - tion of RNA and masks cell - to - cell variation [ 1 , 2 ] . To effectively study these aspects of gene regulation , it is necessary to study RNA at the cellular level . A method that has achieved this aim is in situ hybrid - ization followed by microscopic analysis . Initially , researchers performed in situ hybridizations using radi - oactive probes [ 3 ] . Early improvements involved link - ing the probes to enzymes that catalyze chromogenic or fluorogenic reactions [ 4 – 6 ] . In Arabidopsis mRNA in situ hybridization has been routinely used for detailed visu - alization of gene expression patterns [ 7 – 9 ] . While this method gives good semi - quantitative spatial information , it produces images with limited cellular resolution . More recently plant researchers have used fluorescently labeled probes to directly label transcripts . This has improved cellular resolution , but relatively poor sensitivity has resigned it mainly for detection of highly repetitive RNAs [ 10 , 11 ] . Single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridiza - tion ( smFISH ) was developed to maximize both sensi - tivity and specificity by using multiple singly labelled probes to visualize RNA molecules as discrete spots of fluorescence [ 12 ] . A recent version of this method uses 48 fluorescently labeled DNA oligonucleotides ( 20mers ) to hybridize to different portions of each transcript . This provides a balance between probe length and number that effectively reduces false positive signals ( due to off - target binding ) whilst maintaining single molecule sensi - tivity [ 13 ] . Establishment of smFISH in other model systems has led to greater understanding of transcriptional regula - tion for many genes [ 14 – 17 ] . In addition to quantifying mRNA at the single cell level , this detection method can be used to visualize sites of transcription [ 18 ] and long non - coding RNAs [ 19 ] . Optical properties of plant cells and tissues provide significant challenges for fluorescence microscopy [ 20 ] . Inherent light scattering adversely affects both the exci - tation and the detection efficiency ; moreover plants contain many native molecules that emit high levels of background auto fluorescence compared to other organ - isms [ 20 ] . We chose to develop a smFISH method in Open Access Plant Methods * Correspondence : stefanie . rosa @ jic . ac . uk 1 Department of Cell and Developmental Biology , John Innes Centre , Norwich Research Park , Norwich NR4 7UH , UK Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 10 Duncan et al . Plant Methods ( 2016 ) 12 : 13 fixed Arabidopsis root cells as they typically allow clearer imaging than leaves or other above ground tissue . We established our method by probing a widely expressed housekeeping gene At1G13320—the A2 scaf - folding subunit of Protein Phosphatase2A ( PP2A ) [ 21 ] . Unlike several environmentally regulated phosphatase subunits , it exhibits mRNA levels that are relatively unperturbed by a range of abiotic and biotic stresses and is transcribed evenly across many tissue types throughout development . These robust properties led to PP2A being identified as a superior gene for qPCR normalization [ 22 ] . To validate our method we used smFISH to detect PP2A mRNAs and used an image analysis pipeline to automate transcript counting within cells . Together our smFISH protocol and image analysis algorithm provides a straightforward framework for other plant research - ers to study gene expression at the single - cell and single - molecule resolution . Results and discussion We designed our initial set of smFISH probes to hybrid - ize exclusively to PP2A exons in order to visualize mRNA locations ( Fig . 1a ) . We prepared our samples using a root squash method that typically yields many cells in a sin - gle - layer . This method together with the use of red and far - red dyes maximized mRNA signals whilst minimizing background fluorescence . We observed non - specific signals in endo - reduplicated nuclei from the differentiation zone and this restricted our analysis to the meristem region ( Additional file 1 ) . Consistent with other reports , we visualized PP2A mRNAs as punctate signals 250 – 300 nm homogeneously dispersed throughout the cytoplasm [ 13 , 23 ] ( Fig . 2a , b , Additional file 2 ) . We found wide - field far superior to confocal microscopy for smFISH imaging with fur - ther improvements achieved by deconvolution ( Fig . 2c ) . RNase treatment confirmed that our signals represent RNA locations ( Additional file 3 ) . Next we designed 48 probes to be complimentary only to PP2A introns to identify sites of transcription [ 18 ] ( Fig . 1a ) . We found that these signals were invari - ably restricted to the nucleus and co - localized with PP2A mRNA foci ( Fig . 3a – f ; Additional file 4 ) . Also , consistent with RNA production being halted during cell division , we were unable to detect nascent RNA during mitosis ( Fig . 3g – i ) . We had equal success in imaging RNA labelled with Quasar ® 570 and 670 dyes , but we were unable to observe RNA labelled with FITC ( data not shown ) . We found super - resolution structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) produced high quality images of our samples ; therefore it may be possible to overcome this multiplex limitation through the detection of spectrally barcoded smFISH probes [ 24 ] ( Additional file 5 ) . We used an automated image analysis workflow to identify and quantify mRNA in our smFISH images ( Fig . 4 ) . Out - of - focus light caused background signal intensity to vary greatly through the image , making it impossible to apply a single uniform threshold level for spot counting . To overcome this we normalized image intensities for each plane of the z - stack before tak - ing a maximum intensity projection .

Plant Methods ( 2016 ) 12 : 13 detection to this projection and then used template matching to determine the probe locations . This proce - dure allowed us to avoid having to determine a threshold manually for each image . To obtain cell - level transcript counts we used the watershed algorithm to segment the image into cells using seeds derived from the DAPI nuclear stain channel . We then combined this segmen - tation with the RNA locations within each segmented cell to generate an annotated image showing derived cell boundaries and transcript counts per cell ( Fig . 5 ) . We chose to perform the analysis on a projection of the z - stack because it simplifies the processing considerably . For data with a higher density of mRNAs or situations where the position of the mRNAs in the z direction is of interest , the spot detection and segmentation algorithms could be implemented in three dimensions . However , for these data , spot density was not high enough to make this necessary . Automated analysis of our images revealed that > 70 % of cells contain 90 or less PP2A mRNA molecules whilst the remaining ~ 30 % contain between 90 and 220 mol - ecules ( Fig . 6a ) . Every cell we observed contained a minimum of 15 PP2A mRNA molecules ( Fig . 6a ) and an average of 74 mRNAs were detected in each cell ( Fig . 6b ) . Consistent with identification of PP2A as a superior nor - malization gene [ 22 ] , nascent RNA signals were observed in 84 % of cells . ( Fig . 6c , d , Additional file 6 ) . Conclusions In this report we present a FISH method that allows for gene - expression profiling of transcripts in Arabidopsis roots . By characterizing cell - to - cell transcriptional vari - ability of the housekeeping gene PP2A we demonstrate that smFISH can be combined with automated image analysis to quantify single RNA transcripts for the first time in plants . As smFISH has been used extensively for RNA analysis in many model organisms [ 25 – 28 ] we believe that this root squash protocol can be eas - ily adapted to suit other plant species with amendments made to the fixation and permeabilization steps as nec - essary . However adapting smFISH for use in green tis - sues is likely to represent a greater challenge due to high levels of autofluorescence . Similar issues have been over - come in other organisms through the application of tis - sue clearing [ 16 ] and cryosectioning [ 29 ] . We believe that similar approaches may also be employed to enable tran - script imaging in other plant tissues . In addition to quantifying mRNA and visualizing active sites of transcription at the single cell level , corrobora - tory qRT - PCR data has shown that smFISH can be used to calculate mRNA fold changes at the cellular level [ 13 ] . This method can also identify RNA derived from mater - nal and paternal gene copies [ 30 ] and , in conjunction with masking oligonucleotides , it can even distinguish RNA transcripts that differ by only a single nucleotide polymorphism [ 31 ] . Our adaptation of smFISH for use in Arabidopsis thaliana now opens up these exciting oppor - tunities to the plant research community .

Input of PP2A coding sequence into the program automatically generates a set of probes complementary to the PP2A mRNA , optimized for binding to the target sequence . Before ordering our pre - labelled probes from Biosearch Technologies we com - pleted a TAIR BLAST query for each sequence to ensure target specificity ( https : / / www . arabidopsis . org / Blast / ) . Tables 1 and 2 list the oligonucleotide sequences used to detect PP2A mRNA and nascent transcripts respectively . Sample preparation ( timing : 2 h ) Seedlings were removed from the media 10 days after germination . Root tips were dissected using a razor blade and forceps and placed into a glass dish containing 4 % paraformaldehyde to fix for 30 min at room temperature . The roots were removed from the fixative and washed twice with 1 × PBS . 3 – 4 roots were then arranged on a slide and covered by a glass coverslip and the meristems were squashed manually by applying pressure through Confocal Image DAPI z - stack Probe channel z - stack DAPI projection Minimum intensity projection Maximum intensity projection Seeds for segmentation Point edges Segmentation Template matching Annotated projection Fig . 4 Automated mRNA counting image analysis workflow Page 6 of 10 Duncan et al . Plant Methods ( 2016 ) 12 : 13 the coverslip . The slide , together with the sample and coverslip , were then submerged briefly in liquid nitrogen ( ~ 5 s ) to adhere the roots to the slide . The coverslip was then flipped off with a razor blade and the samples were left to dry at room temperature for a minimum of 30 min . Tissue permeabilization was then carried out by immers - ing the samples in coplin jars containing 70 % ethanol and left to shake gently for a minimum of 1 h . Note : We ensured coplin jar lids were sealed with para - film to prevent evaporation during the ethanol incuba - tion period . Hybridization ( timing : 4 h—overnight ) Residual ethanol was left to evaporate at room tempera - ture for 5 min before 2 , 2 - min washes were carried out with wash buffer . 100 μl of hybridization solution with probes at a final concentration of 250 nM was then added to each slide . Coverslips were laid over the samples to pre - vent buffer evaporation and the probes were left to hybrid - ize in a humid chamber at 37 °C overnight in the dark . Sample mounting ( timing : 2 h ) Hybridization solution containing unbound probes was removed using a pipette in the morning . Each sam - ple was then washed twice with 200 μl wash buffer and finally immersed in coplin jars containing wash buffer for 30 min at 37 °C . 100 μl of the nuclear stain DAPI was then added to each slide and left to incubate at 37 °C for 30 min . Following DAPI removal , 100 μl 2 × SSC was added samples and removed . 100 μl GLOX buffer minus enzymes was added to the samples and left to equili - brate for 2 min and then replaced with 100 μl of anti - fade GLOX buffer containing enzymes . The samples were then covered by coverslips sealed . Excess GLOX buffer was wicked away using tissue before the coverslips were sealed with nail varnish . We immediately imaged our samples as we observed a noticeable reduction in image quality around 4 h after mounting . Note : Oxygen - scavenging GLOX buffer maximised the stability of our smFISH fluorophores and we observed rapid bleaching when it was substituted with the commercial anti - fade mounting media Vectorshield ( data not shown ) . Image acquisition A Zeiss Elyra PS1 inverted microscope was used for imaging . A 100X oil - immersion objective ( 1 . 46 NA ) and cooled EM - CCD Andor iXon 897 camera ( 512 × 512 QE > 90 % ) was used to obtain all images in the stand - ard , rather than super - resolution mode . The following wavelengths were used for fluorescence detection : for probes labeled with Quasar ® 570 an excitation line of 561 nm was used and signal was detected at 570 – 640 nm ; for probes labeled with Quasar ® 670 an excitation line of 642 nm and signal was detected at 655 – 710 nm ; for DAPI an excitation line of 405 nm and signal was detected at wavelengths of 420 – 480 nm . For all experiments expo - sure times between 200 – 250 ms were used and a series of optical sections with z - steps of 0 . 2 μm were collected .

To confirm RNA specificity we incubated samples with RNase for 1 h at 37 ° C in a humid chamber after the ethanol permeabilization step , rinsed in 10 mM HCl for 5 min , washed twice with 2 × SSC for 5 min before the protocol was continued . Z - stacks were deconvolved using AutoQuant X2 ( Media Cybernetics ) . Projections and analysis of 3D pic - tures were performed using Fiji ( an implementation of ImageJ , a public domain program by W . Rasband avail - able from http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) . Typically from 4 to 6 roots more than 300 cells can be obtained by this method , which were then suitable for further analysis using our automated mRNA counting programme . Structured illumination microscopy A Zeiss Elyra PS1 inverted microscope was used for imaging using a 63X water objective ( 1 . 2 NA ) to match samples mounted in GLOX buffer . The SIM camera used was an EM - CCD Andor iXon 885 . We collected × 5 phases at × 3 angles total 15 images per plane . Series of optical sections with z - steps of 0 . 2 μm were collected . The following wavelengths were used for fluorescence detection : for probes labeled with Quasar ® 570 an exci - tation line of 561 nm was used and signal was detected at 570 – 640 nm ; for probes labeled with Quasar ® 670 an excitation line of 642 nm and signal was detected at 655 – 710 nm ; for DAPI an excitation line of 405 nm and signal was detected at wavelengths of 420 – 480 nm . For all experiments series of optical sections with z - steps of 0 . 2 μm were collected . Images were processed using Zen Black default parame - ters . The images were also colour aligned using Zeiss “chan - nel aligned” tool . Reference images of multiple coloured beads were collected in SIM mode then processed . Then an alignment matrix was generated using the SIM bead data and this was applied to the experimental SIM data .

Plant Methods ( 2016 ) 12 : 13 FISHcount . Our smFISH image analysis consists of two components—cell segmentation and mRNA counting . These combine into an overall workflow that results in an image where each cell is annotated with the number of mRNA located within it ( Figs . 4 , 5 ) . Bioformats [ 32 ] is used to convert the microscope image into individual z - stacks for each channel . The analysis pipeline then pro - cesses these z - stacks to produce the annotated image , and is implemented in the Python programming lan - guage [ 33 ] . Segmentation The Watershed algorithm is used to segment the image into regions representing cells , using the implementation provided by the scikit - image library [ 34 ] . Segmentation using the Watershed algorithm requires an input image denoting gradient magnitude , and a set of seeds for ini - tialising the flood filling of the input image . To identify the seeds for the Watershed algorithm each plane in the DAPI stack is normalised for intensity , then a maximum intensity projection taken . Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization ( CLAHE , [ 35 ] ) is used to locally equalize the intensity of the projection . A Sobel filter is applied to the projection to find nuclear edges . Otsu’s thresholding is then applied to select the nuclei . Each detected nucleus is reduced to its centroid for use as a seed for the segmentation . The gradient magnitude input for the Watershed algorithm is generated by taking a minimum intensity projection of the probe channel , which represents the background auto - fluorescence of each cell . This pro - jection is equalized with CLAHE and smoothed with a Gaussian filter . Taking this image as the basis for the Watershed algorithm and applying the seeds derived from the DAPI channel yields a segmented image . mRNA counting To locate the spots representing RNA molecules , each z - slice in the probe channel stack is normalised , and a maximum intensity projection of the stack taken . A Sobel filter is applied to the projection to detect edges . We use scikit - image’s implementation of fast normalised cross - correlation template matching to find the probe locations . This algorithm tests the correlation between a given template and the equivalently sized section of a larger image for each point in that image . It produces another image , the intensity values of which correspond to the degree to which the template correlates with the image ( so that the maximum intensity value corresponds with perfect correlation , and the minimum with perfect anti - correlation ) . We initially apply this algorithm using a template constructed as an annular element sized to the diffraction radius of the microscope . The single closest match to this template is then taken as a second template to re - apply the correlation . We then apply a correlation threshold , correlation values above which corresponded to identified mRNA spots , yielding their locations . This threshold was chosen based on comparison to manual spot counting in test data sets , such that it gave an opti - mum balance between false negatives and false positives . For validation of the results , identified spot locations and the segmentation derived from the DAPI nuclear stain and probe autofluorescence is used to produce an annotated image . This image overlays probe counts and segmentation boundaries on the projection of the probe autofluorescence channel . Each image is manually inspected to ensure that the image analysis workflow has not generated spurious results .
