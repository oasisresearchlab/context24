Bending membranes Tom Kirchhausen It is widely assumed that peripheral membrane proteins induce intracellular membrane curvature by the asymmetric insertion of a protein segment into the lipid bilayer , or by imposing shape by adhesion of a curved protein domain to the membrane surface . Two papers now provide convincing evidence challenging these views . The first shows that specific assembly of a clathrin protein scaffold , coupled to the membrane , seems to be the most prevalent mechanism for bending a lipid bilayer in a cell . The second reports that membrane crowding , driven by protein – protein interactions , can also drive membrane bending , even in the absence of any protein insertion into the bilayer .

Calculations based on the classic Helfrich model suggest that it costs about 200 – 250 kcal per mole of vesicle to create a closed spheri - cal bilayer from an initially flat one 1 . Certain lipids can generate spontaneous membrane curvature when asymmetrically inserted into the lipid bilayer 2 ( Fig . 1a ) . Lipids with a large area ratio of polar head groups to acyl chains create positive curvature ; lipids with the opposite ratio create negative curvature ( as does the insertion of cholesterol ) . This source of membrane bending is clearly insuf - ficient , however , to explain the remarkable spatial and temporal heterogeneity and speci - ficity of shapes and curvatures observed in the internal membranes of cells . Coordinated assembly of a protein scaffold can provide the driving force to induce membrane curvature if the components of the scaffold are anchored firmly to the lipid bilayer 3 , 4 ( Fig . 1b ) . Budding of some enveloped viruses proceeds in this way and , in principle , a similar process can induce the membrane deformation required for the budding of vesicular and tubular carri - ers of intracellular cargo . This mechanism has a role in the formation of most intracellular vesicular carriers , particularly those asso - ciated with clathrin or the COPI or COPII coat protein complexes . The discovery of membrane - associated proteins with curved , lipid - facing surfaces ( for example , those with so - called BAR ( Bin – Amphiphysin – Rvs ) pro - tein domains ) , and of others that appear to bind with the hydrophobic side of an amphi - pathic helix inserted into the head - group – hydrocarbon interface ( for example , the epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain ) , has given rise to the proposal that these proteins also have a role in driving membrane curva - ture 5 ( Fig . 1c , d ) , as well as — or even instead of — the assembly of the coats 6 . In the case of clathrin - coated pits , for example , it has been argued that the lattice of clathrin triskelions that surrounds the pit simply follows the cur - vature induced by recruitment of epsin 6 and the F - BAR - containing proteins FCHo1 and FCHo2 ( ref . 7 ) . Two important papers , one by Dannhauser and Ungewickell 8 and the other by Stachowiak et al . 9 , provide convincing , straightforward and elegant evidence addressing two fundamental questions . First , is clathrin sufficient to drive membrane curvature ? Second , are specific membrane – protein interactions required to deform the underlying membrane , driven either by the shape of the protein in contact with the membrane or by protein insertion ? Dannhauser and Ungewickell present clear in vitro evidence supporting the hypothesis that clathrin can drive membrane deforma - tion without the need for other , potentially membrane - deforming proteins 8 . Their work shows that induction of membrane curva - ture mediated by proteins such as epsin is dispensable for the creation of deeply invagi - nated , clathrin - coated pits on liposomes and , by extension , at the plasma membrane . Their experimental system allowed precise control of the molecular components present , ena - bling them to recapitulate scission mediated by dynamin and GTP , as well as uncoating medi - ated by auxilin , Hsc70 and ATP . These authors recruited clathrin to the liposomes by using a truncated form of epsin , still capable of interact - ing with the N - terminal domain of clathrin but lacking the N - terminal ENTH domain , hence unable to interact directly with a lipid bilayer . The authors replaced the ENTH domain with a short flexible peptide linker , tagged at its N - terminus with 6 histidines ; this tag binds tightly to Ni - NTA , covalently attached to the 906 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 14 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2012 © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Incubation of a mix - ture containing clathrin , the truncated epsin and large liposomes containing the Ni - NTA lipid led to the formation of clathrin coats clearly associated to membrane invaginations or buds with sizes similar to those observed in vivo . The membrane necks of these buds were sufficiently narrow to support recruitment of dynamin , which , upon activation with GTP , promoted tubule scission and release of coated vesicles . Finally , the clathrin coat surrounding these coated vesicles could be released by the ATP - dependent uncoating reaction mediated by Hsc70 and auxilin . These observations are important , not only because they are the first experiments in which clathrin - coated vesicles have been formed from liposomes using such a minimal set of proteins , but also , and more crucially to the bending question , because vesicle formation occurred perfectly well in the absence of membrane - curvature - inducing domains . The paper by Stachowiak et al . is likewise a significant advance , as it shows that membrane crowding , driven by protein – protein interac - tions , is sufficient to drive membrane bending , even in the absence of any protein insertion into the lipid bilayer 9 ( Fig . 1e ) . The authors show that high local protein concentration ( crowding ) can drive membrane curvature and tubulation , regardless of how the proteins are recruited to the membrane . They used giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) containing phosphatidylino - sitol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) as the membrane substrate , and showed that tubula - tion could be achieved with either the ENTH domain of epsin or the ANTH domain of AP180 ( another protein found in endocytic clathrin - coated pits and vesicles ) . The ANTH domain resembles the ENTH domain , but lacks the amphipathic helix . Using fluorescence - lifetime Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) , they found that tubules formed efficiently when ~ 20 % of the membrane was covered by the epsin ENTH domain ; at this level , only 2 % of the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich area would have been occupied by the amphipathic helix , equivalent to 1 epsin per 100 lipid molecules , well below the 10 – 25 % coverage predicted to generate high curvature by hydrophobic insertion . An even more remarkable result was the observation that an ENTH domain with its putative membrane insertion helix replaced by a 6 - histidine tag also drove tubulation of GUVs containing Ni - NTA lipids and lacking PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 when coverage a Spontaneous membrane curvature b Protein scaffolding c Protein insertion d Protein shape e Protein crowding Figure 1 Mechanisms to generate membrane curvature .

In some cases , membrane localiza - tion activates enzymatic activities supported by other domains of the same protein ; in oth - ers , the sensors in turn localize other proteins to particular curved membrane domains . The sensor proteins will , of course , also stabilize the curvature of the membrane with which they associate . The papers by Dannhauser and Ungewickell 8 and by Stachowiak and colleagues 9 raise the bar for convincing explanations of how membrane deformations are generated in cells . Although their work comes from in vitro analyses of rela - tively artificial systems , they clearly show that any physical model for membrane bending must be evaluated for its relevance at the pro - tein concentrations and membrane composi - tions occurring naturally in cells . Perhaps the simplest general model , consistent with present data , is that specific protein assembly , coupled to the membrane , is the most prevalent mechanism for bending a lipid bilayer in a cell . The polym - erizing protein can be a coat ( clathrin , COPI or COPII ) or a cytoskeletal element ( actin or tubulin ) . Curvature - sensing proteins can then accumulate to define the subsequent function and fate of the bent membrane .

Experiments in cells that sought to iden - tify the role of the F - BAR proteins FCHo1 and FCHo2 in clathrin - coated pit formation led to the proposal that these proteins initiate coated pit formation by inducing membrane curvature 7 . Subsequently , more sensitive live cell imaging experiments instead indicated that these proteins arrive after initiation of coat assembly , and that they stabilize the growing clathrin lattice to prevent its dissociation 10 . Developmental studies also show a regulatory rather than an initiating role for these F - BAR proteins 11 . As the work of Dannhauser and Ungewickell 8 illustrates , assembly of curved coats with a defined shape , along with a set of connections between the coat assembly units and the membrane , provides a more logical explanation of how bending and curvature are introduced than does an extrapolation of the in vitro properties of curvature - preferring molecules . The energy comes from the protein – protein interactions in the coat , and the unidi - rectionality of the process , from the splitting of ATP by the Hsc70 uncoating enzyme 12 . Proteins such as those with BAR or ENTH domains , or other proteins that insert into the membrane as hairpins ( for example , the ER - associated reticu - lons 13 ) , can clearly act as membrane curvature Positive curvature Negative curvature Zero curvature Figure 2 Membrane curvature sensors . These are proteins whose binding affinity for membranes depends on the extent of membrane curvature . Curvature sensing typically relies on insertion of amphipathic domains into the lipid bilayer , or on the interaction of a curved protein domain with the surface of the membrane . reached the same 20 % threshold . Tubulation was also obtained using 6 - histidine - tagged green flu - orescence protein ( GFP ) , even though this pro - tein is not known to bind membranes or to have any specific membrane - bending function . What appears to be happening is that the membrane bends to dilute the concentrated protein layer , even though the protein has only a peripheral tether linking it to the lipid headgroups . How do these new data bear on the view that peripheral membrane proteins can gen - erate functionally relevant membrane curva - ture — either by hydrophobic or amphipathic protein domains that penetrate the lipid bilayer matrix , or by intrinsically curved , hydrophilic protein domains ( or assemblies ) that adhere to the lipid bilayer surface and impress their shapes on the membrane ? The results that led to this view came primarily from in vitro obser - vations of membrane deformation driven by excess protein . However , the concentrations of membrane - bound protein in those experi - ments far exceeded the concentrations of the same or similar proteins in cells . In effect , concentrating the proteins in the laboratory generated the energy required for lipid bilayer deformation . There is no evidence for any comparable concentrating mechanism in cells . As Stachowiak et al . 9 show , high local surface density of even proteins nonspecifically associ - ated with the membrane ( crowding ) can induce 908 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 14 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2012 © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited .
