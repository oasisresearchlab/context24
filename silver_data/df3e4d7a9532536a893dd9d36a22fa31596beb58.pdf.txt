SIR – MODEL FOR HOUSEHOLDS PHILIPP D¨ONGES ∗ , THOMAS G¨OTZ † , TYLL KR¨UGER ‡ , KAROL NIEDZIELEWSKI § , VIOLA PRIESEMANN ∗ , AND MORITZ SCH¨AFER † Abstract . Households play an important role in disease dynamics . Many infections hap - pening there due to the close contact , while mitigation measures mainly target the transmission between households . Therefore , one can see households as boosting the transmission depending on household size . To study the eﬀect of household size and size distribution , we diﬀerentiated the within and between household reproduction rate . There are basically no preventive measures , and thus the close contacts can boost the spread . We explicitly incorporated that typically only a fraction of all household members are infected . Thus , viewing the infection of a household of a given size as a splitting process generating a new , small fully infected sub – household and a remain - ing still susceptible sub – household we derive a compartmental ODE – model for the dynamics of the sub – households . In this setting , the basic reproduction number as well as prevalence and the peak of an infection wave in a population with given households size distribution can be computed analytically . We compare numerical simulation results of this novel household – ODE model with results from an agent – based model using data for realistic household size distributions of diﬀerent countries . We ﬁnd good agreement of both models showing the catalytic eﬀect of large households on the overall disease dynamics . Key words .

The spread of an infectious diseases strongly depends on the interaction of the considered individuals . Traditional SIR – type models assume a homogeneous mixing of the population and typically neglect the increased trans - mission within closed subcommunities like households or school – classes . However , literature indicates , that household transmission plays an important role [ 3 , 4 , 9 ] . In case of the COVID – pandemic , several studies have quantiﬁed the secondary attack rate within households , i . e . the probability household - members get infected , given that one household member is infected [ 3 , 7 , 9 – 12 ] . The secondary attack rate depends on the virus variant , immunity and vaccination status , cultural diﬀerences and mitigation measures within a household ( like e . g . early quarantine ) . In De - cember 2021 , when both the Delta and Omicron variants were spreading , it ranged between about 19 % ( Delta variant in Norway ) [ 9 ] to 39 % ( Omicron in Spain ) [ 3 ] . Hence , interestingly , the secondary attack rate within a household is far from 100 % despite the close contacts . There are several models reported that try to include the contribution of in – household transmission to the overall disease dynamics . The Reed – Frost model describing in – household infections as a Bernoulli – process has be used by [ 4 , 5 ] . An average model assuming households always get completely infected and ignoring the temporal dynamics has been proposed in [ 2 ] . Their ﬁndings for the eﬀective reproduction number agree with our results , see ( 3 . 2 ) . Extensions of diﬀerential equation based SIR – models in case of a uniform household distribution have be proposed by [ 6 , 8 ] . However , in real populations , the household distribution is far from uniform , see [ 14 ] . Ball and co – authors provided in [ 1 ] an overview of challenges posed by integrating household eﬀects into epidemiological models , in particular in the context of compartmental diﬀerential equations models . ∗ Max Planck Institute for dynamics and self – organization , G¨ottingen , Germany ( philipp . doenges @ ds . mpg . de ) . † Mathematical Institute , University Koblenz , Germany ( goetz @ uni - koblenz . de ; nkruchinina @ uni - koblenz . de ; moritzschaefer @ uni - koblenz . de ) . ‡ Polytechnic University Wroclaw , Poland ( tyll . krueger @ pwr . edu . pl ) . § University Warsaw , Poland ( k . niedzielewski @ icm . edu . pl ) . 1 a r X i v : 2301 . 04355v1 [ q - b i o .

We will treat the infection of a given household as a splitting process generating two new sub – households or house - hold fragments of smaller size - representing the susceptible ( S ) or fully infected ( I ) members . Each of the susceptible household fragments can get infected and split later in time , while infected household segments recover with a certain rate and are then immune ( recovered or removed , R ) . The dynamics of the susceptible , infected and recovered household segments is modeled in Section 2 . In Section 3 , we compute the basic reproduction number for our household model combining the attack rate inside a single households and the transmission rate between individual households . The prevalence , as the limit of the recovered part of the population can be computed analytically — at least in case of small maximal household size , see Section 4 . The peak of a single epidemic wave in a population with given household distribution is considered in Section 5 . Again , for small maximal household size , we will be able to compute analytically the maximal number of infected . Numeri - cal simulations based on realistic household size distributions for diﬀerent countries and a comparison with an agent – based model demonstrate the applicability of the presented model . As outlook with focus on non – pharmaceutical interventions we consider an extension of our model quarantining infected sub – households based on a certain detection rate for a single infected . 2 . Household Model . Instead of real households we consider eﬀective sub – households or household fragments , still called households throughout this paper , being either fully susceptible , infected or recovered . Let S j , I j and R j denote the number of the respective households consisting of j persons , where 1 ≤ j ≤ K and K denoting the maximal household size . Then H j = S j + I j + R j equals to the total number of current sub – households of size j . Furthermore , we introduce H = (cid:80) Kj = 1 H j as the total number of households and h j = H j / H . The total population is given by N = (cid:80) Kj = 1 jH j . For further reference we also introduce the ﬁrst two moments of the household size distribution µ 1 : = K (cid:88) j = 1 jh j and µ 2 : = K (cid:88) j = 1 j 2 h j . If an infection is brought into a susceptible sub – household of size j , secondary infections will occur inside the household . We assume that each of the remaining j − 1 household members can get infected with probability a , called the in – household attack rate . On average , we expect E j = a ( j − 1 ) + 1 infections ( including the primary one ) inside a household of size j . Existing ﬁeld studies , see [ 7 , 12 ] indicate an in – household attack rate in the range of 16 % – 30 % depending on the overall epidemiological situation , household size and vaccinations . For the sake of tractability and simplicity , our model assumes a constant attack rate a independent of the household size . Let b j , k denote the probability , that a primary infection in a household of size j generates in total k infections inside this household , where 1 ≤ k ≤ j . The secondary infections give rise to a splitting of the initial household of size j into a new , fully infected sub – household of size k and another still susceptible sub – household of size j − k . An infected household of size k recovers with a rate γ k and contributes to the overall force of infection by an out – household infection rate β k . We assume that SIR – MODELS FOR HOUSEHOLDS 3 the out – household reproduction number is independent of the household size , i . e . ( 2 . 1 ) R ∗ = β k γ k = constant independent of k . Now , the dynamical system governing the dynamics of the susceptible , infected and recovered households of size k reads as S (cid:48) k = Y   − kS k + K (cid:88) j = k + 1 jS j · b j , j − k   , ( 2 . 2a ) I (cid:48) k = − γ k I k + Y K (cid:88) j = k jS j · b j , k , ( 2 . 2b ) R (cid:48) k = γ k I k , ( 2 . 2c ) where Y : = 1 N K (cid:88) k = 1 β k · kI k denotes the total force of infection . For the recovery rate of an infected household of size k we can consider the two extremal cases and an intermediate case . 1 . Simultaneous infections : All members of the infected household get infected at the same time and recover at the same time , hence the recovery rate γ k = γ 1 is independent of the household size . Assumption ( 2 . 1 ) leads to a constant out – household infection rate β k = β . 2 . Sequential infections : All members of the household get infected one after another and the total recovery time for the entire household equals to k times the individual recovery time . Hence the recovery rate γ k = γ 1 / k and by ( 2 . 1 ) we get β k = β 1 / k . 3 . Parallel infections : The recovery times T i , i = 1 , . . . , k for each of the k infected individuals are modeled as independent exponentially distributed random variables . Hence the entire household is fully recovered at time max ( T 1 , . . . , T k ) . The recovery rate γ k equals to the inverse of the expected recovery time , i . e . γ k = 1 E [ max ( T 1 , . . . , T k ) ] = 1 E [ T 1 ] · θ k = γ 1 θ k , where θ k = 1 + 12 + · · · + 1 k ∼ log k + g denotes the k – th harmonic number and g ≈ 0 . 5772 . . . denotes the Euler – Mascheroni constant . All these cases can be subsumed to γ k = γ 1 η k , β k = β 1 η k , where η k models the details of the temporal dynamics inside an infected household . In Figure 2 . 1 we compare these three cases in the scenario of a population with maximal household size K = 6 . Each household size represents 1 / 6 of the entire population . Initially , 1 (cid:104) of the population is infected . The out – household reproduction number is assumed to be R ∗ = 1 . 33 , in – household attack rate equals a = 0 . 2 and the recovery rate γ 1 for an infected individual equals 0 . 1 .

Modeling the infections inside the household by a Bernoulli – process with in – household attack rate ( infection probability ) a ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] , the total number of infected persons inside the household follows a binomial distribution ( 2 . 3 ) b j , k : = (cid:18) j − 1 k − 1 (cid:19) a k − 1 ( 1 − a ) j − k . For the binomial in – household infection ( 2 . 3 ) it holds , that E j = a ( j − 1 ) + 1 . Theorem 2 . 2 . In model ( 2 . 2 ) the total population N = (cid:80) Kk = 1 k · ( S k + I k + R k ) is conserved . Proof . We have N (cid:48) = Y   − K (cid:88) k = 1 k 2 S k + K (cid:88) k = 1 k K (cid:88) j = k + 1 jS j b j , j − k + K (cid:88) k = 1 k K (cid:88) j = k jS j b j , k   We consider the last two summands separately and reverse the order of summation . Hence K (cid:88) k = 1 k K (cid:88) j = k jS j b j , k = K (cid:88) j = 1 jS j j (cid:88) k = 1 kb j , k = K (cid:88) j = 1 jE j S j SIR – MODELS FOR HOUSEHOLDS 5 and analogously K (cid:88) k = 1 k K (cid:88) j = k + 1 jS j b j , j − k = K (cid:88) j = 2 jS j j − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 kb j , j − k = K (cid:88) j = 2 jS j j − 1 (cid:88) l = 1 ( j − l ) b j , l = K (cid:88) j = 2 jS j j (cid:88) l = 1 ( j − l ) b j , l = K (cid:88) j = 2 jS j (cid:32) j j (cid:88) l = 1 b j , l − j (cid:88) l = 1 lb j , l (cid:33) = K (cid:88) j = 2 j 2 S j − jE j S j = K (cid:88) j = 1 j 2 S j − jE j S j − ( S 1 − E 1 S 1 ) . Due to E 1 = 1 , the last term vanishes . Summing all the contributions , we ﬁnally get N (cid:48) = Y   K (cid:88) j = 1 − ( j 2 S j ) + jE j S j + ( j 2 S j − jE j S j )   = 0 . 3 . Basic Reproduction Number . To compute the basic reproduction num - ber for the household – model ( 2 . 2 ) , we follow the next generation matrix approach by Watmough and van den Driessche , see [ 15 ] . We split the state variable x = ( S 1 , . . . , R K ) ∈ R 3 K into the infected compartment ξ = ( I 1 , . . . I K ) ∈ R K and the remaining components χ ∈ R 2 K . The infected compartment satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation ξ (cid:48) k = F k ( ξ , χ ) − V k ( ξ , χ ) where F k = Y (cid:80) Kj = k jS j b j , k , V k = γ k ξ k and Y = 1 N (cid:80) Kj = 1 β j jξ j . Now , the Jaco - bians at the disease free equilibrium ( 0 , χ ∗ ) are given by F kj = ∂ F k ∂ ξ j ( 0 , χ ∗ ) = 1 N jβ j K (cid:88) m = k mH m b m , k V kk = ∂ V k ∂ ξ k ( 0 , χ ∗ ) = γ k and V kj = 0 for k (cid:54) = j The next generation matrix G ∈ R K × K is given by G = FV − 1 = 1 N (cid:32) jβ j γ j K (cid:88) m = k mH m b m , k (cid:33) k , j Using the relation ( 2 . 1 ) we obtain G = R ∗ (cid:32) j K (cid:88) m = k mH m N b m , k (cid:33) k , j = R ∗   (cid:80) K m = 1 mH m N b m , 1 (cid:80) Km = 2 mH m N b m , 2 . . .

A . The basic reproduction number R = ρ ( G ) is deﬁned as the spectral radius ρ ( G ) of the next generation matrix G ∈ R K × K . As a dyadic product , G has rank one and hence there is only one non – zero eigenvalue . Lemma 3 . 1 . Let c , d ∈ R n be two vectors with c T d (cid:54) = 0 . The non – zero eigen - value of the dyadic product A = dc T ∈ R n × n is given by c T d = tr ( A ) . Proof . Let v be an eigenvector of A to the eigenvalue λ . Then λv = Av = ( dc T ) v = ( c T v ) d , where c T v ∈ R . If λ (cid:54) = 0 , then v = c T vλ d . Set µ = c T vλ ∈ R . Now , Av = A ( µd ) = µ ( dc T ) d = ( c T d ) µd = ( c T d ) v ; hence λ = c T d . As an immediate consequence we obtain Theorem 3 . 2 . The basic reproduction number of system ( 2 . 2 ) is given by ( 3 . 1 ) R = R ∗ K (cid:88) i = 1 i K (cid:88) m = i mH m N b m , i = R ∗ K (cid:88) m = 1 mH m N E m . Corollary 3 . 3 . In the particular situation , when the expected number of in - fections inside a household of size m is given by E m = a ( m − 1 ) + 1 , the basic reproduction number equals ( 3 . 2 ) R = R ∗ (cid:20) 1 + a (cid:18) µ 2 µ 1 − 1 (cid:19)(cid:21) . Assuming , that the infection of any member of a household results in the in - fection of the entire household , i . e . in – household attack rate a = 1 , our result R = µ 2 µ 1 R ∗ agrees with the result obtained by Becker and Dietz in [ 2 , Sect . 3 . 2 ] . 4 . Computing the prevalence . Let z = 1 N (cid:80) Kk = 1 kR k denote the fraction of recovered individuals . Then z satisﬁes the ODE z (cid:48) = Y R ∗ . In the sequel we will derive an implicit equation for the prevalence lim t →∞ z ( t ) in two special cases : 1 . for maximal household size K = 3 . The procedure used here allows for im - mediate generalization but the resulting expression gets lengthy and provide only minor insight into the result . 2 . for in – household attack rate a = 1 and arbitrary household sizes . In this setting the equations ( 2 . 2a ) for the susceptible households decouple and allow and complete computation of the equation for the prevalence . We will start with the second case . Let us consider a = 1 , i . e . inside households infections are for sure and E k = k . Then the ODE for the susceptible households reads as S (cid:48) k = − Y kS k and we can insert the recovered z S (cid:48) k = − k R ∗ S k z . After integration with respect to t from 0 to ∞ , we get ln S k ( ∞ ) S k ( 0 ) = k R ∗ ( z ( 0 ) − z ( ∞ ) ) . Assuming initially no recovered individuals , i . e . z ( 0 ) = 0 and considering the total population at the the end of time , i . e . N = Nz ( ∞ ) + (cid:80) k kS k ( ∞ ) , we arrive at the system N = Nz ( ∞ ) + K (cid:88) k = 1 kS k ( 0 ) e − k R ∗ z ( ∞ ) . SIR – MODELS FOR HOUSEHOLDS 7 Scaling with N , i . e . introducing s k , 0 = S k ( 0 ) / N , we get 1 = z + K (cid:88) k = 1 k s k , 0 e − k R ∗ z .

If double households dominate ( green ) , the prevalence is larger than in the case of mostly single households ( red ) , since households speed up the infection dynamics . of K = 2 for reproduction numbers R ∗ ∈ [ 0 , 3 ] and initially 2 % of the entire population being infected . The three diﬀerent graphs correspond to diﬀerent initial values for the susceptible households : both single and double households contain 49 % of the population ( blue ) , 89 % of susceptibles live in single households and only 9 % in double households ( red ) or just 9 % in single households and 89 % in double households ( green ) . In case of arbitrary in – household attack rates a ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] , we consider the situa - tion for K = 3 . Setting z = Z / N , the relevant equations read as S (cid:48) 3 = − 3 R ∗ z (cid:48) S 3 S (cid:48) 2 = R ∗ z (cid:48) ( − 2 S 2 + 3 b 3 , 1 S 3 ) S (cid:48) 1 = R ∗ z (cid:48) ( − S 1 + 2 b 2 , 1 S 2 + 3 b 3 , 2 S 3 ) . Solving the equations successively starting with S 3 ( t ) = S 3 ( 0 ) e − 3 R ∗ z ( t ) and using variation of constants , we arrive at S 2 ( t ) = S 2 ( 0 ) e − 2 R ∗ z ( t ) + 3 b 3 , 1 S 3 ( 0 ) (cid:16) 1 − e −R ∗ z ( t ) (cid:17) e − 2 R ∗ z ( t ) S 1 ( t ) = S 1 ( 0 ) e −R ∗ z ( t ) + 2 b 2 , 1 ( S 2 ( 0 ) + 3 b 3 , 1 S 3 ( 0 ) ) (cid:16) 1 − e −R ∗ z ( t ) (cid:17) e −R ∗ z ( t ) + 32 ( b 3 , 2 − 2 b 2 , 1 b 3 , 1 ) S 3 ( 0 ) (cid:16) 1 − e − 2 R ∗ z ( t ) (cid:17) e −R ∗ z ( t ) . 8 P . D¨ONGES , T . G¨OTZ , T . KR¨UGER , E . A . For the prevalence z = lim t →∞ z ( t ) we obtain the implicit equation ( 4 . 2 ) 1 = z + (cid:2) s 1 , 0 + 2 b 2 , 1 s 2 , 0 + 3 ( b 2 , 1 b 3 , 1 + 12 b 3 , 2 ) s 3 , 0 (cid:3) e −R ∗ z + 2 ( 1 − b 2 , 1 ) [ s 2 , 0 + 3 b 3 , 1 s 3 , 0 ] e − 2 R ∗ z + 3 (cid:2) 1 + ( b 2 , 1 − 2 ) b 3 , 1 − 12 b 3 , 2 (cid:3) s 3 , 0 e − 3 R ∗ z or in short 1 = z + c 1 e −R ∗ z + c 2 e − 2 R ∗ z + c 3 e − 3 R ∗ z , where the coeﬃcients c 1 , c 2 and c 3 are the above , rather lengthy expressions involv - ing the initial conditions and the in – household infection probabilities b j , k . In case of K = 2 , i . e . setting s 3 , 0 = 0 , we get ( 4 . 3 ) 1 = z + ( s 1 , 0 + 2 b 2 , 1 s 2 , 0 ) e −R ∗ z + 2 ( 1 − b 2 , 1 ) s 2 , 0 e − 2 R ∗ z . In case of arbitrary household size K > 3 , the resulting equation for the prevalence will have the same structure . For the binomial infection distribution with a = 1 this reduces to 1 = z + s 1 , 0 e −R ∗ z + 2 s 2 , 0 e − 2 R ∗ z + 3 s 3 , 0 e − 3 R ∗ z and in case of a = 0 we arrive at 1 = z + ( s 1 , 0 + 2 s 2 , 0 + 3 s 3 , 0 ) e −R ∗ z . In case of small initial infections , i . e . s 1 , 0 + 2 s 2 , 0 + 3 s 3 , 0 = c 1 + c 2 + c 3 ≈ 1 , Eqn . ( 4 . 2 ) allows for the trivial , disease free solution z = 0 . However , above the threshold R c = 1 c 1 + 2 c 2 + 3 c 3 the non – trivial endemic solution shows up . Expanding the exponential for R ∗ z (cid:28) 1 , we arrive at 1 ≈ z + ( c 1 + c 2 + c 3 ) − R ∗ z ( c 1 + 2 c 2 + 3 c 3 ) + R ∗ 2 z 2 2 ( c 1 + 4 c 2 + 9 c 3 ) and hence z ( R ∗ ( c 1 + 2 c 2 + 3 c 3 ) − 1 ) ≈ R ∗ 2 z 2 2 ( c 1 + 4 c 2 + 9 c 3 ) . Besides the trivial solution z = 0 , this approximation has the second solution ( 4 . 4 ) z (cid:39) 2 ( R ∗ ( c 1 + 2 c 2 + 3 c 3 ) − 1 ) R ∗ 2 ( c 1 + 4 c 2 + 9 c 3 ) . If R ∗ > R c = ( c 1 + 2 c 2 + 3 c 3 ) − 1 , this second root is positive . The following Figure 4 . 2 ( left ) shows the numerical solution of the prevalence equation ( 4 . 3 ) in case of K = 2 for reproduction numbers R ∗ ∈ [ 0 , 3 ] and initially 2 % of the entire population being infected while both single and double households contain 49 % of the susceptible population . The diﬀerent curves show the results depending on the in – household attack rate a . The graph on the right depict the case K = 3 and s 1 , 0 = s 2 , 0 = s 3 , 0 = 16 for three diﬀerent in – household attack rates a . The approximation ( 4 . 4 ) is shown by the dashed curves . For R ∗ < R c , the trivial disease free solution z = 0 is the only solution .

For K = 2 we have to consider the problem S (cid:48) 1 = Y [ − S 1 + 2 S 2 b 2 , 1 ] S (cid:48) 2 = Y [ − 2 S 2 ] J (cid:48) = Y (cid:20) − N R ∗ + S 1 + 2 E 2 S 2 (cid:21) . Note , that E 2 = b 2 , 1 + 2 b 2 , 2 and b 2 , 1 + b 2 , 2 = 1 , hence b 2 , 1 = 2 − E 2 . For sake of shorter notation and easier interpretation , we introduce the scaled compartments s 1 = S 1 / N , s 2 = S 2 / N and j = J / N . Writing s 1 as a function of s 2 , we get ds 1 ds 2 = E 2 − 2 + s 1 2 s 2 with the solution s 1 = c √ s 2 − 2 ( 2 − E 2 ) s 2 , where c = 2 ( 2 − E 2 ) √ s 2 , 0 + s 1 , 0 / √ s 2 , 0 .

This solution is only meaningful , if s 1 + 2 s 2 ≤ 1 , i . e . ( 5 . 1 ) 1 R ∗ ≤ 1 + 2 ( E 2 − 1 ) x 2 which is an implicit equation for a threshold value of R ∗ . To obtain the value of j at the maximum , we plug this root into the above solution for j and arrive at j max = 1 − 1 2 R ∗ (cid:16) 1 + ln s 2 , 0 x 2 (cid:17) − cx 2 . Hence , the peak of infection j max is a function of the out – household reproduction number R ∗ = β k / γ k , the expected infections in double households E 2 and the initial conditions s 2 , 0 , s 1 , 0 . In particular , it is independent of the scaling of the recovery periods γ k , as can be seen also in the more complex setting presented in Figure 2 . 1 . The following Figure 5 . 1 shows the peak of infection j max versus the out – household reproduction number R . Solutions are only plotted , if the condition ( 5 . 1 ) is satisﬁed .

( Right : ) Variation with respect to diﬀerent in – household attack rates . 6 . Simulations and comparison with agent – based model . The analy - sis of our household model presented in the previous sections , shows that larger households have a strong eﬀect on the spread of the epidemic . To illustrate this , we simulate a single epidemic wave in populations with close to realistic house - hold distribution . For comparison we choose the household size distributions for Bangladesh ( BGD ) , Germany ( GER ) and Poland ( POL ) as published by the UN statistics division in 2011 , see [ 14 ] . Using a sample of almost 1 000 000 individuals , we obtain the distribution shown in Table 6 . 1 .

The sample is based on a scaled population of 1000000 . Diﬀerences are due to round – oﬀ eﬀects . Remark 6 . 1 . Note , that in Table 6 . 1 we have redistributed for Poland and Bangladesh the fraction of population living in households of size 6 or bigger to household of size equal 7 to match the total population . How one treats the popu - lation represented by the tail in the household distribution can make a substantial diﬀerence in the simulation outcomes . To visualize that , we show in Figure 6 . 1 simulations for out – household reproduction number R ∗ = 0 . 9 , in – household attack rate a = 0 . 2 and three diﬀerent versions of how to treat the tail in the Polish house - hold size distribution . The blue curve represents the population distribution given in Table 6 . 1 . The green curve uses the extended census data including households up to size 10 + . All households of size 10 + are treated as households of size equal to 10 . The red curve show a simpliﬁed treatment of the tail , where all households of size 6 + are treated as being of size equal to 6 . The simulation redistributing the households of size 6 + to size 7 ( blue ) agrees within the simulation accuracy with the detailed distribution ( green ) . The simpliﬁed treatment ( red ) shows already a signiﬁcant diﬀerence . This diﬀerence will be even more pronounced for smaller reproduction numbers R ∗ since the smaller households ﬁrst get subcritical with decreasing R ∗ . This result clearly visualizes the need for careful treatment of the tail in the household size distribution , since big households have an overproportional impact on the dynamics . Unfortunately , most publicly available data truncates the household size distribution at size 6 . From a modeling and simulation point of view , there is a need for more detailed data on the household size distribution including information for households of size bigger than 6 . 0 100 200 300 400 500 Time t 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 35000 T o t a l I n f e c t e d POL , R _ 0 = 0 . 90 redistribution to K = 7 cut - off at K = 10 cut - off at K = 6 Fig . 6 . 1 .

As initial condition for our simulation we assume 100 infected single households . The recovery rates inside the households are described using the model of parallel infections , i . e . γ k = γ 1 / ( 1 + 1 / 2 + · · · + 1 / k ) . For the out – household reproduction number R ∗ we consider the range 0 . 6 ≤ R ∗ ≤ 2 . 3 and the in – household attack is chosen as a = 0 . 25 . The ODE – system ( 2 . 2 ) is solved using a standard RK4 ( 5 ) – method . Figures 6 . 2 and 6 . 3 show a comparison of the three countries . The prevalance and the maximum number of infected shown in Fig . 6 . 2 clearly visualize that large households are drivers of the infection . For moderate out – household reproduction number R ∗ (cid:39) 1 , Bangladesh , with an average household size µ 1 = 4 . 4 , faces a rela - tive prevalence being approx . 50 % higher than Germany with an average household size of µ 1 = 2 . 1 persons . Also the peak number of infected is almost twice as high in Bangladesh compared to Germany for R ∗ ∈ [ 1 , 1 . 25 ] . Fig . 6 . 3 shows the simu - lation of a single infection wave for moderate out – household reproduction number R ∗ = 1 . 1 and in - household attack rate a = 0 . 25 . The graph illustrates the faster and more severe progression of the epidemics in case of larger households . The peak of the wave occurs in Bangladesh 60 days earlier and aﬀects almost double the number of individuals compared to Germany . 0 . 75 1 . 00 1 . 25 1 . 50 1 . 75 2 . 00 2 . 25 out - household Repro - number R * 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 r e l .

SIR – MODELS FOR HOUSEHOLDS 13 To validate our model , we compared it to a stochastic , microscopic agent – based model developed at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computa - tional Modelling at the University of Warsaw . Complete details of this model are given in [ 13 ] . In this model agents have certain states ( susceptible , infected , re - covered , hospitalized , deceased , etc . ) and infection events occur in certain con - text , i . e . in households , on the streets or workplaces and several more . Besides the household – context , the street – context is used to capture infection events out - side households . Since the ODE – model ( 2 . 2 ) is a variant of an SIR – model , the agent – based model also just uses the SIR – states and ignores all other states . The agent – based model uses for each infected individual a recovery time that is sampled from an exponential distribution with mean 10 days . Based on the household dis - tribution for Poland , Figure 6 . 4 provides a comparison of the computed prevalence vs . the out – household reproduction number for our model 2 . 2 and the agent – based model ( blue squares ) . The solid lines show the results of the ODE – model for dif - ferent in – household attack rates . The relative prevalence plotted in the ﬁgure is deﬁned as the total number of recovered individuals for time t → ∞ ; here we use T = 2 000 days for practical reasons . 0 . 75 1 . 00 1 . 25 1 . 50 1 . 75 2 . 00 2 . 25 out - household Repro - number 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 r e l .

The graph on the left shows the peak of the incidences , i . e . the maximum number of daily new infections and the graph on the right shows the time , when this peak occurs . For all three presented criteria : prevalence , peak height and peak time , our ODE – household model ( 2 . 2 ) matches quite well with the agent – based simulation . Best agreement can be seen for in – household attack rate a in the range between 0 . 16 and 0 . 20 . 7 . Eﬀect of household quarantine . In this section we will extend our ba - sic model ( 2 . 2 ) to households put under quarantine after an infection is detected . Therefore , we introduce the additional compartments Q k of quarantined households 14 P . D¨ONGES , T . G¨OTZ , T . KR¨UGER , E .

The extended household model reads as S (cid:48) k = Y   − kS k + K (cid:88) j = k + 1 jS j · b j , j − k   ( 7 . 1a ) I (cid:48) k = − γ k I k − q k I k + Y K (cid:88) j = k jS j · b j , k ( 7 . 1b ) Q (cid:48) k = q k I k ( 7 . 1c ) R (cid:48) k = γ k I k ( 7 . 1d ) Here q k > 0 denotes the detection and quarantine rate for a household of size k . Let q > 0 be the probability of infected individual to get detected . The probabil - ity that a household consisting of k infected gets detected equals d k ( q ) = 1 − ( 1 − q ) k . Given recovery and detection rates γ k and q k for a household of size k , the proba - bility , that the household gets detected before recovery equals q k / ( γ k + q k ) , which equals d k ( q ) . Therefore q k γ k = d k ( q ) 1 − d k ( q ) ∼ kq for q (cid:28) 1 . To compute the basic reproduction number , we repeat the computations for the next generation matrix . The vector ξ of infected compartments remains unaltered and the new quarantine compartments Q 1 , . . . , Q K are included in the vector χ . The gain term F k for the infected compartments remains unaltered as well , but the loss term reads as V k = ( γ k + q k ) ξ k . Accordingly , its Jacobian modiﬁes to V kk = γ k + q k and ﬁnally the next generation matrix G reads as G = β N (cid:32) j γ j + q j K (cid:88) m = i mH m b m , i (cid:33) i , j = R ∗   (cid:80) Km = 1 mH m N b m , 1 (cid:80) Km = 2 mH m N b m , 2 . . .

Due to denominator 1 + q k / γ k we cannot interpret the last sum as the expected infected cases in a household of size m . In the asymptotic case of small quarantine rates q k (cid:28) 1 , we can use the series expansion ( 1 + q k / γ k ) − 1 ∼ 1 − q k / γ k ∼ 1 − kq and get R q ∼ R ∗ K (cid:88) m = 1 mH m N (cid:32) E m − q m (cid:88) k = 1 k 2 b m , k (cid:33) . So , the second moment of the in – household infection distribution comes into play . Remark 7 . 1 . If the expectation E m and the the second moment (cid:80) mk = 1 k 2 b m , k of the in – household infections scale linear with the household size m , then the above reproduction number depends on also on the third moment of the household size distribution . This leads to a straight – forward extension of the result ( 3 . 2 ) . In case of a binomial distribution of the in – household infections , it holds that E m = a ( m − 1 ) + 1 and (cid:80) mk = 1 k 2 b m , k = a ( m − 1 ) ( 3 + a ( m − 2 ) ) + 1 . For the reproduction number we arrive at the expression R q ∼ R ∗ (cid:20) 1 − q γ + a (cid:18) 1 − 3 q γ ( 1 − a ) (cid:19) (cid:18) µ 2 µ 1 − 1 (cid:19) − q γ a 2 (cid:18) µ 3 µ 1 − 1 (cid:19)(cid:21) , where µ 3 : = (cid:80) Kk = 1 k 3 h k denotes the third moment of the household size distribution . The eﬀectiveness of quarantine measures can be assessed by relating the reduc - tion in prevalence to the quarantined individuals . For a given detection probability q > 0 , let Z ( q ) denote the prevalence observed under these quarantine measures and let Q ( q ) denote the total number of individuals quarantined . We deﬁne the eﬀectiveness of the quarantine measures as η q : = | Z ( q ) − Z ( 0 ) | Q ( q ) . The numerator equals to the reduction in prevalence and hence η can be interpreted as infected cases saved per quarantined case . In Figure 7 . 1 we compare the eﬀectiveness in the setting of household distribu - tions resembling Germany ( predominantly small households ) and Bangladesh ( large households are dominant ) for out – household reproduction numbers in the range be - tween 0 . 9 and 1 . 2 . The results indicate , that quarantine measures are less eﬀective in societies with larger households since infection chains inside households are not aﬀected by the quarantine . On the other hand , quarantine measures seem most eﬀective in presence of small households and for low reproduction numbers . 8 . Conclusion and Outlook . The ﬁndings of the compartmental household model ( 2 . 2 ) are in rather good agreement with microscopic agent – based simulations . Despite its several simplifying assumptions , the prevalence and the peak of the infection wave are reproduced quite well . However , ﬁeld data suggests that the in – household attack rate a is signiﬁcantly higher for 2 – person households than for larger households , see [ 7 , 12 ] . Analyzing the data given in [ 7 ] the attack rate in two – person households is by a factor of 1 . 25 – 1 . 5 larger than in households with three or more members . According to [ 12 ] this may be caused by spouse relationship to the index case reﬂecting intimacy , sleeping in 16 P . D¨ONGES , T . G¨OTZ , T . KR¨UGER , E .

An extension of the model ( 2 . 3 ) to attack rates a k depending on the household size k is straightforward . Carrying over the analytical computation of the reproduction number ( 3 . 2 ) would lead to a variant of ( 3 . 2 ) including weighted moments of the household size distribution . When considering quarantine for entire households , the model shows some in - teresting outcomes . Deﬁning the ratio of reduction in prevalence and number of quarantined persons as the eﬀectivity of a quarantine , the model suggests that quar - antine is more eﬀective in populations where small households dominate . Whether this ﬁnding is supported by ﬁeld data is a topic for future literature research . Vaccinations are not yet included in the model . From the point of view of public health , the question arises whether the limited resources of vaccines should be distributed with preference to larger households . Given the catalytic eﬀect of large households on the disease dynamics , one could suggest to vaccinate large households ﬁrst . However , a detailed analysis of this question will be subject of follow – up research . When extending our ODE SIR – model to an SIRS – model including possible reinfection a recombination of the recovered sub – households is required . Again , this extension will be left for future work . A relaxation of the distribution of the recovered sub – household distribution to the overall household distribution seems a tractable approach to tackle this issue . REFERENCES [ 1 ] F . Ball , T .
