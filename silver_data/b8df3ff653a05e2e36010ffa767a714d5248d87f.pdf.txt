Introduction Non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is one of the most common can - cers and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide ( Siegel et al . , 2015 ) . The majority of patients are diagnosed only after the disease has spread beyond the primary site . Thus , systemic chemotherapy , usu - ally with combinations containing platinum - based and microtubule - disturbing drugs , forms the foundation of the treatment of these pa - tients . As is the case for most advanced cancers , acquired apoptosis and therapy resistance pose , however , major challenges for the treat - ment of NSCLC ( Chang , 2011 ) . During cancer development , cells accu - mulate numerous genetic and epigenetic alterations to escape apoptosis initially induced by the transformation process itself , later by the hostile tumor environment and ﬁ nally by cancer treatment ( Groth - Pedersen and Jäättelä , 2013 , Hanahan and Weinberg , 2011 ) . Moreover , chemotherapy - treated cancer cells often acquire an ability to ef ﬂ ux the chemotherapeutic drugs by increasing the expression of multidrug resistance ( MDR ) - associated P - glycoproteins of the ATP - binding cassette transporter family ( Gottesman et al . , 2002 , Chang , 2011 ) . Importantly , cells harbor alternative cell death pathways that re - main functional even in otherwise therapy - resistant cancer cells ( Fulda , 2014 , Kallunkiet al . , 2013 ) . Of specialinterest inthis context is lysosom - al cell death . Cancer progression to metastatic disease depends on the activation of the lysosomal compartment , which is manifested by in - creased lysosomal biogenesis and acidi ﬁ cation ( Kallunki et al . , 2013 , Perera et al . , 2015 ) . Besides being tumor - promoting , these lysosomal changes associate with reduced lysosomal membrane stability ( Fehrenbacher etal . , 2008 , Fehrenbacheretal . , 2004 ) . Thisfrailty ofcan - cer cell lysosomes can be targeted by several cationic amphiphilic drugs ( CADs ) that accumulate in the acidic lysosomes and induce lysosomal damage preferentially in cancer cells ( Ostenfeld et al . , 2008 , Petersen et al . , 2013 , Sukhai et al . , 2013 , Jahchan et al . , 2013 , Shchors et al . , 2015 ) .

Contents lists available at ScienceDirect EBioMedicine journal homepage : www . ebiomedicine . com CADs include hundreds of pharmacologic agents used to treat a broadspectrumof commondiseases , e . g . psychiatric disorders , allergies , heart diseases and infections ( Kornhuber et al . , 2010 ) . They are charac - terized by a hydrophobic ring structure and a hydrophilic side chain with a cationic amine group . In acidic milieu , the basic amine groups are protonated allowing an up to 1000 - fold drug accumulation inside acidic lysosomes ( Trapp et al . , 2008 ) . The incorporation of CADs into membranes in thelysosomal lumen neutralizes thenegative membrane charge thereby inhibiting the function of several lysosomal lipases , in - cluding acid sphingomyelinase ( Kolzer et al . , 2004 ) . Cancer cells are es - pecially sensitive to the accumulation of sphingomyelin ( Barcelo - Coblijn et al . , 2011 , Teres et al . , 2012 , Petersen et al . , 2013 ) , which may explain why CADs that are effective acid sphingomyelinase inhibitors display selective cytotoxicity towards transformed cells ( Petersen et al . , 2013 , Sukhai et al . , 2013 , Jahchan et al . , 2013 , Shchors et al . , 2015 ) . Repurposing of well - characterized and well - tolerated drugs for can - certherapyhasemergedasanattractivealternativeforalongandcostly process of drug development . Encouraged by the well - documented anti - cancer activity of several CADs , we searched systematically for CADs with highest anti - NSCLC potential by screening a CAD library for cytotoxicity against A549 NSCLC cells . Prompted by the enrichment of antihistamines among the hits , we performed a more detailed study of their cytotoxic activity alone and in combination with chemotherapy , and conducted a pharmacoepidemiological register - based cohort study of the association between CAD antihistamine use and mortality among Danish cancer patients . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Pharmacoepidemiological Study To evaluate the association between use of antihistamines and mor - tality among all Danish residents above 30 years of age diagnosed with any non - localized cancer ( de ﬁ ned based on either regional or distant metastases ) during 1995 – 2011 or non - localized NSCLC during 2004 – 2011 ( Supplemental Table S1 ) , we linked data from six nationwide sociodemographic or health registries described below and in the Supplemental Table S2 using the personal identi ﬁ cation number assignedtoallDanishresidents ( Thygesenetal . , 2011 ) . FromtheDanish Prescription Registry , we retrieved information on prescriptions dispensed during 1995 – 2011 for systemic CAD ( astemizole , clemastine , desloratadine , ebastine , loratadine and terfenadine ) and non - CAD ( cetirizine and fexofenadine ) antihistamines ( Supplemental Table S2 ) . Ebastine , loratadine , cetirizine and fexofenadine became available over - the - counter during the study period . The majority of the antihistamine sale ( ebastine N 75 % , loratadine N 65 % , cetirizine N 55 % and fexofenadine N 97 % ) was , however , by prescription ( Sundhedsdatastyrelsen , 2016 ) . We de ﬁ ned antihistamine ( CAD or non - CAD ) use asoneor more prescriptionswithin 0 – 6 month following thediagnosis of any non - localized cancer and from three months before untilthreemonthsafterthenon - localizedNSCLCdiagnosis . Thepatients were followed from six ( all non - localized cancers ) or three ( non - local - ized NSCLC ) months after the diagnosis until death , emigration , or end ofstudy ( 31December2013 ) , whicheveroccurred ﬁ rst . Coxproportion - al hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios ( HRs ) and 95 % con ﬁ denceintervals ( CIs ) forall - cause mortalityassociated withtheuse of antihistamines . The time since baseline was used as the underlying time - scale . We compared users of CAD antihistamines with non - users , as well as with users of either of the two non - CAD antihistamines fexofenadine or cetirizine , while adjusting for covariates identi ﬁ ed fromprescriptionandpatientregistries ( TablesS3andS4 ) . Werepeated the analyses strati ﬁ ed according to records of chemotherapy ( yes / no ) during the ﬁ rst six months following the diagnosis , which were avail - able only for patients diagnosed between 2002 – 2011 . The HR estimates for all - cause death associated with use of antihis - taminewereadjusted for age , yearof cancer diagnosis , highestachieved education , disposable income , Charlson Comorbidity Index score and drugs as described below . From the Prescription Registry ( Kildemoes et al . , 2011 ) , we obtained information on prescriptions of aspirin , non - aspirin nonsteroidal anti - in ﬂ ammatory drugs ( NA - NSAID ) , statins and inhibitors of the renin - angiotensin system ( including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEi ) and angiotensin - receptor blockers ( ARB ) ) . Use of the ‘ confounder drugs ’ was de ﬁ ned as ≥ 1 prescriptions within theexposure period for antihistamines . From the DanishNation - al Patient Registry ( Schmidt et al . , 2015 ) , we retrieved information on history ( at baseline ) of diagnoses of chronic conditions included in the validated Charlson Comorbidity Index ( Charlson et al . , 1987 ) and com - puted Charlson Comorbidity Index score , categorized as 0 , 1 or ≥ 2 . Socio - economic status one year prior to the cancer diagnosis was esti - mated by the highest achieved education and the disposable income re - trieved from registers at Statistics Denmark ( Jensen and Rasmussen , 2011 , Baadsgaard and Quitzau , 2011 ) . The local institutional review board and the Danish Data Protection Agency approved the study and waived the requirement for individual informed consent . Ethical approval is not required for registry - based studies in Denmark . 2 . 2 . Danish Registries The Danish Cancer Registry has recorded detailed nationwide infor - mation on cancer incidence since 1943 and offers an accurate and al - most complete record of cancer cases ( Storm et al . , 1997 , Gjerstorff , 2011 ) . Cancer diagnoses are recorded according to the International Classi ﬁ cation of Diseases , Eighth ( ICD - 8 ) or Tenth Revision ( ICD - 10 ) , and the International Classi ﬁ cation of Diseases for Oncology ( ICD - O ) is used for coding of topography and morphology ( Gjerstorff , 2011 ) . The Cancer Registry also contains data on clinical stage , categorized as local - ized , regional , distant , or unknown until 2003 and according to the tumor - node - metastasis ( TNM ) system from 2004 to the present ( Storm et al . , 1997 , Gjerstorff , 2011 , Edge and Compton , 2010 ) . The Danish Prescription Registry consists of records of all drug pre - scriptions dispensed at pharmacies in Denmark since 1995 ( Kildemoes et al . , 2011 ) . The data include the type and amount of drug prescribed accordingtotheAnatomicalTherapeuticalChemical ( ATC ) classi ﬁ cation system ( WHO , 2013 ) , number of packages , and thedate of dispensingat the pharmacy . The dosing schedule and indication ( s ) are not recorded , and no information is available on drug use dispensed at hospital level . The Danish National Patient Registry contains detailed individual data onallsomatichospitalizationsinDenmarksince1977 andonambulato - ry hospital contacts and psychiatric admissions since 1995 ( Schmidt et al . , 2015 ) . Discharge and contact diagnoses are coded according to ICD - 8from 1977to 1993andICD - 10 from 1994 tothepresent . Informa - tiononmaintypesofoncologicaltherapy ( chemotherapy , radiotherapy , endocrine therapy , etc . ) is available from 2002 . The Danish Register of Causes of Death contains information on date and cause of death of all inhabitants of Denmark , classi ﬁ ed according to ICD - 8 until 1993 and to ICD - 10 from 2004 ( Helweg - Larsen , 2011 ) . Statistics Denmark administers registries on socio - economic data , in - cluding education and income , of all Danish residents ( Jensen and Rasmussen , 2011 , Baadsgaard and Quitzau , 2011 ) . The Population Education Register holds information on the highest completed level of education , derived from type and duration of school - ing ( Baadsgaard and Quitzau , 2011 ) . The Danish Civil Registration System maintains thecivil registry num - ber ( encoding gender and date of birth ) assigned to all Danish residents since 1968 and contains continuously updated address , date of death , and migration to and from Denmark . Use of the civil registration num - ber ensures unambiguous linkage between population - based registries ( Thygesen et al . , 2011 , Schmidt et al . , 2014 ) . 131 A . - M . Ellegaard et al . / EBioMedicine 9 ( 2016 ) 130 – 139 2 . 3 . Cell Culture and Treatments A549 ( ATCC® CCL - 185 ™ ) , NCI - H1299 ( ATCC® CRL - 5803 ™ ) and NCI - H661 ( ATCC® HTB - 183 ™ ) NSCLC cell lines , DU145 prostate cancer cell line ( ATCC® HTB - 81 ™ ) and MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cell line ( ATCC® HTB - 26 ™ ) were obtained from American Type Culture Collec - tion ( ATCC ) . The cells were authenticated by the ATCC by short tandem repeat analysis , and they were used within 6 months after thawing . 132 A . - M . Ellegaard et al . / EBioMedicine 9 ( 2016 ) 130 – 139 Multidrug - resistant variants of DU145 cells ( DU145 - MDR ) and MDA - MB - 231 ( MDA - MB - 231 - MDR ) have been described previously ( Ellegaard et al . , 2013 , Hansen et al . , 2015 ) . The multidrug resistant var - iant of A549 cells ( A549 - MDR ) were derived by repeated 3 - day treat - ments of A549 cells with increasing doses of vinorelbine up to 150 nM . The parental cells ( DU145 - P , MDA - MB - 231 - P and A549 - P , re - spectively ) were grown in parallel . The NIH - 3T3 ﬁ broblasts transduced with either the empty pBabe - puro retrovirus or the c - Src Y527F - contain - ing pBabe - puro retrovirus have been described elsewhere ( Fehrenbacher et al . , 2004 ) , and their identity has been con ﬁ rmed with RNA - Seq ( Petersen et al . , 2013 ) . The A549 , NCI - H661 , NCI - H1299 and DU145 cells were cultured in RPMI - 1640 ( Gibco , 61870 - 010 ) sup - plemented with 10 % ( A549 , NCI - H661 and NCI - H1299 ) or 6 % ( DU145 ) heat - inactivated fetal calf serum ( Gibco , 10270 ) . The MDA - MB - 231 andNIH - 3T3cells werecultured inDulbecco ' s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle ' s medium ( Gibco , 31966 - 021 ) supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal calf serum and for the NIH - 3T3 cells also with non - essential amino acids ( Gibco , 11140 - 035 ) . All cells were kept at 37 °C in a humidi ﬁ ed atmo - sphere of 5 % CO 2 . All cells were regularly tested and found negative for mycoplasma . Theproviders , catalognumbers , andCASnumbersofthecompounds in the CAD library are listed in Supplemental Table S5 . O - desmethyl - astemizole ( D290750 ) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals , cisplatin ( P4394 ) , cetirizine ( C3618 ) , propidium iodide ( P4864 ) , necrostatin - 1 ( N9037 ) , docetaxel ( 01885 ) , vinorelbine ditartrate salt ( V2264 ) , fexofenadine hydrochloride ( F9427 ) , ebastine ( E9531 ) , KO143 ( K2144 ) and Hoechst - 33342 ( B2261 ) from Sigma ; benzyloxycarbonyl - Val - Ala - Asp ( OMe ) ﬂ uoromethylketone ( zVAD - fmk ) ( N1510 - 0025 ) from Bachem ; leucin - leucin - O - methyl ( LLOMe ) ( sc - 285992 ) and carebastine ( sc - 211022 ) from Santa Cruz Biotechnolo - gy ; PSC833 ( ab145870 ) from Abcam ; cyclizine hydrochloride ( C3090000 ) from European Pharmacopoeia Reference Standard ; and meclizine dihydrochloride ( 155341 ) from MP Biochemicals . Siramesine was kindly provided by Christiane Volbracht and A . Bredal Christensen ( H . Lundbeck A / S , Valby , Denmark ) . 2 . 4 . Viability and Cell Death Assays Cell death was measured after 15 min propidium iodide ( 0 . 2 μ g / mL ) and Hoechst - 33342 staining ( 2 . 5 μ g / mL ) at 37 °C employing Celígo® Imaging Cytometer ( Nexcelom Bioscience ) according to the manufacturer ' s manual . Apoptotic nuclear condensation was evaluated in Hoechst - 33342 stained cells using Olympus IX81 microscope with a 20× Olympus objective , Scan ^ R automated acquisition software ( version 2 . 3 . 0 . 5 ) and analysis with ImageJ ( version 1 . 48v ) . To evaluate clonogenic survival , cells were seeded at approximately 400 cells / well in 24 - well plates , treated as indicated , stained with crystal violet - meth - anolfor15 min , washedthreetimes inH 2 O , dried andanalyzedwiththe colony veri ﬁ cation application of the Celígo® Imaging Cytometer . Lysosomal membrane permeabilization was detected by staining paraformaldehyde - ﬁ xed cells on glass coverslides with antibodies recognizing LGALS - 1 ( Abcam , ab25138 ) and LAMP2 ( Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , H4B4 - S ) followed by AlexaFluor488 - or AlexaFluor594 – coupled secondary antibodies ( Molecular Probes , A21206 and A21203 , respectively ) as described previously ( Aits et al . , 2015 ) . Hoechst - 33342 staining was used to visualize the DNA . The samples were mounted with Pro - Long Gold anti - fade ( Molecular Probes , P36935 ) and confocal ﬂ uorescent images were obtained with Carl Zeiss Axiovert LSM700 microscope with a 40× Carl Zeiss objective and the Zen 2010 software . 2 . 5 . Western Blot Analysis Proteins separated in a 6 – 15 % gradient SDS - PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane were visualized with primary antibodies against MDR1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 13131 ) , alpha - tubulin ( Abcam , ab15246 ) and GAPDH ( AbD Serotec , MCA4740 ) , horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies ( anti - mouse , Dako , P0260 ; anti - rabbit , VectorLaboratories , PI - 1000 ) , andECLWesternblot - tingreagents ( BIORAD , 170 - 5061 ) employingLuminescentImageRead - er ( Fuji ﬁ lm , LAS - 4000 ) . 2 . 6 . Rhodamine123 Assay Cells were pre - treated for 1 h with 0 . 25 μ g / mL Rhodamine123 ( Invitrogen , 890808 ) , treated asindicated for 2 h , washed in clearmedi - um , stained with Hoechst - 33342 and analyzed with the target 1 + 2 ( Merge ) application of the Celígo® Imaging Cytometer . Hoechst - 33342 staining was used to verify equal cell number in the wells . 2 . 7 . Statistical Analysis The proportional hazards assumption for the registry - based study was assessed by testing for trends in the scaled Schoenfeld residuals . All analyses were performed in R version 3 . 0 . 2 using the packages sur - vival ( Therneau , 2014 ) and Epi ( Carstensen et al . , 2014 ) . Level of signif - icance was set to 5 % in all analyses . The statistical signi ﬁ cance of the experimental results was analyzed by a two - way ANOVA test followed by Dunnett ' s , Sidak ' s or Tukey ' s multiple comparisons tests ( α = 0 . 05 ) using GraphPad Prism version 6 . 0e . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . A Screen for CADs That Kill NSCLC Cells To identify clinically relevant drugs that could complement the existing NSCLC therapy , we screened a CAD library , containing 72 drugs selected based on their clinical safety pro ﬁ les and reported ability to inhibit acid sphingomyelinase ( Kornhuber et al . , 2008 , Kornhuber et al . , 2010 ) for cytotoxicity against A549 NSCLC cells . The ten most potent drugs induced over 40 % cell death at 10 μ M and included two antihista - mines , threeantipsychotics , anantiangial , anantidepressant , anantima - larial , an antiprotozolal and an anti - in ﬂ ammatory natural product ( Fig . 1a ) . Fifty of the tested drugs induced over 40 % cell death at 50 μ M ( Supplemental Table S5 ) . The National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) homepage contains growth inhibition ( GI 50 ) and cytotoxicity ( LC 50 ) data for 29 of these compounds screened in a panel of 60 human tumor cell lines , including nine NSCLC cell lines ( NCI , 2015 ) . The mean GI 50 and LC 50 values for these CADs ranged from 0 . 02 – 14 . 2 μ M and from 3 . 89 – 65 . 9 μ M , respectively ( Fig . 1b ) . All 29 CADs had strikingly similar dose response curves in the 60 cell lines tested indicating that their ef ﬁ cacy is not limited to NSCLC or cancers with speci ﬁ c genetic Fig . 1 .

Ellegaard et al . / EBioMedicine 9 ( 2016 ) 130 – 139 alterations ( NCI , 2015 ) . Based on the presence of two antihistamines among the top ﬁ ve hits and the favorable safety pro ﬁ les of antihista - mines , we focused our further investigations on this drug class . 3 . 2 . CAD Antihistamines Destabilize Lysosomal Membranes To further evaluate the anti - cancer activity of antihistamines , we ﬁ rst tested the cytotoxic potential of seven clinically relevant CAD anti - histamines and four non - CAD antihistamines in A549 cells . In addition to terfenadine and astemizole that were among the top hits of our screen , four CAD antihistamines showed signi ﬁ cant cytotoxicity against A549 cells at 50 μ M , whereas the remaining three CAD antihistamines and all four non - CAD antihistamines failed to do so ( Fig . 1c ) . Dose re - sponse studies of the six most effective CAD antihistamines revealed similar responses in three NSCLC cell lines ( A549 , NCI - H1299 and NCI - H661 ) , where terfenadine had the lowest LC 50 values between 5 . 4 – 8 . 2 μ M , followed by astemizole ( 11 . 1 – 15 . 8 μ M ) , ebastine ( 18 . 0 – 21 . 8 μ M ) , clemastine ( 32 . 8 – 40 . 0 μ M ) , desloratadine ( 59 . 5 – 89 . 4 μ M ) and loratadine ( 60 . 1 – 85 . 6 μ M ) ( Fig . 1d and Supplemental Fig . S1a ) . These values are similar to the available mean LC 50 values extracted from the NCI screen of 60 human cancer cell lines , i . e . 6 . 4 μ M for terfenadine , 8 . 0 μ M for astemizole , 38 . 3 μ M for clemastine and 65 . 9 μ M for loratadine ( Fig . 1b ) . The active metabolites of terfenadine ( fexofenadine ) and ebastine ( carebastine ) showed no cytotoxicity against NSCLC cells , the primary metabolite of astemizole ( O - desmethyl - astemizole ) retained approximately half of the potency of the parent compound , and loratadine and its primary metabolite ( desloratadine ) showed similar potency ( Fig . 1d ; Supplemental Figs . S1a and b ; data not shown ) . Consistent with the reported ability of several CADs to induce lyso - somal membrane permeabilization in other cancer cells ( Petersen et al . , 2013 , Ostenfeld et al . , 2008 , Ellegaard et al . , 2013 , Sukhai et al . , 2013 ) , the cytotoxic CAD antihistamines induced lysosomal LGALS1 ( galectin - 1 ) puncta formation , a hallmark of lysosomal leakage ( Aits et al . , 2015 ) , in A549 , NCI - H1299 and NCI - H661 cells at concentrations around their LC 50 values ( Fig . 1e ; Supplemental Fig . S1c ; data not shown ) . Inhibition of apoptosis , necroptosis or ferroptosis by z - VAD - fmk , necrostatin - 1 or ferrostatin - 1 , respectively , had no effect on the cell death induced by CAD antihistamines ( Fig . 1f ) . Finally , the CAD an - tihistamines induced cell death in c - Src Y527F – transformed NIH - 3T3 mu - rine embryonic ﬁ broblasts to a signi ﬁ cantly higher extent than in the corresponding vector control cells ( Fig . 1g ) . Taken together , these data show that CAD antihistamines induce cancer - speci ﬁ c lysosomal cell death in NSCLC cells . 3 . 3 . Use of Astemizole and Loratadine is Associated With Reduced Cancer Mortality Prompted by the cancer - speci ﬁ c cytotoxicity of CAD antihistamines , we conducted a nationwide pharmacoepidemiological cohort study of the association between the use of cytotoxic CAD antihistamines de - scribed above within six months after the diagnosis and mortality among all patients with any non - localized cancer ( Fig . 2 and Supple - mental Table S2 ) . Astemizole or loratadine use was associated with sig - ni ﬁ cantly reduced all - cause mortality as compared with use of the non - CAD antihistamines , fexofenadine or cetirizine ( Table 1 ; Supplemental Tables S3 and S6 ) . The use of ebastine showed a similar tendency , use of terfenadine and desloratadine was without a signi ﬁ cant effect , and clemastine use was associated with a signi ﬁ cantly increased HR for mortality among patients with any non - localized cancer ( Table 1 ) . Sug - gestive of a prescribing bias , the use of clemastine increased over six - fold upon cancer diagnosis in our study cohort ( see Supplemental Table S6 and Discussion ) . When stratifying all patients with non - localized cancer according to the records of chemotherapy within six months after the diagnosis ( available for patients diagnosed at 2002 or later ) , HRs for all - cause Fig . 2 . Consort ﬂ ow diagram of the cohort studies . 134 A . - M . Ellegaard et al . / EBioMedicine 9 ( 2016 ) 130 – 139 mortality among users of all eligible CAD antihistamines , except clemastine , were lower for patients with recorded chemotherapy than for those without such records ( Table 1 ) . Low number of non - localized NSCLC patients hampered a similar analysisofNSCLCmortalityformostCADantihistamines . Theaggressive nature of this disease further reduced the statistical power due to the high mortality during the ﬁ rst six months after the diagnosis . Thus , we rede ﬁ ned the drug exposure periods from six months after the diagno - sis to three months before until three months after the diagnosis ( Fig . 2 ) . The use of the most commonly prescribed CAD antihistamine , loratadine , within this time period showed a statistically signi ﬁ cant in - verse association with mortality , and HRs for all - cause mortality among loratadine users were lower for patients with recorded concur - rent chemotherapy than for those without such records ( Table 2 ; Sup - plemental Tables S4 and S7 ) . The effect appeared independent of the cancer histology because HRs for mortality were similar amongpatients with adenocarcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma and other types of NSCLC ( Table 2 ) . 3 . 4 . Sub - micromolar Concentrations of CAD Antihistamines Revert MDR Clinically relevant doses of loratadine and astemizole result in plas - ma concentrations considerably lower than those required for effective inhibitionofNSCLCcellgrowthorsurvival invitro ( Heykantsetal . , 1986 , Hilbert et al . , 1987 ) . Thus , the putative anti - cancer effects observed above were probably not caused by CADs alone but rather by a com - bined effect of low concentrations of CADs and chemotherapy . MDR1 - mediated resistance to chemotherapy represents one of the major bar - riers to positive long - term outcomes for this patient group ( Chang , 2011 ) , and several CADs have been reported to revert MDR1 - associated drug resistance at micromolar concentrations ( Jaffrezou et al . , 1995 , Petersen et al . , 2013 , Ellegaard et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , we tested whether low , clinically relevant concentrations of CAD antihistamines could re - sensitize MDR1 - expressing NSCLC cells to chemotherapy . Because none of the three NSCLC cell lines used here had detectable MDR1 ex - pression , we ﬁ rst created an MDR - variant of A549 cells by repeated treatments with increasing concentrations of vinorelbine ( Supplemen - tal Figs . S2a and b ) . Astemizole , ebastine and loratadine re - sensitized the obtained A549 - MDR cells signi ﬁ cantly to vinorelbine even at 500 nM , and terfenadine did so at 1 μ M , whereas their primary metabo - lites OD - astemizole , carebastine , desloratadine and fexofenadine , respec - tively , failed to do so at concentrations up to 2 μ M ( Fig . 3a ; Supplemental Fig . S2a ) . Similar MDR1 - speci ﬁ c sensitization to docetaxel was observed in MDR1 - expressing DU145 - MDR prostate cancer cells and MDA - MB - 231 - MDR breast cancer cells treated with low concentrations of CAD an - tihistamines ( Figs 3b and c ; Supplemental Figs . S2d and e ) . Astemizole and terfenadine have been reported to inhibit the ef ﬂ ux activity of MDR1 at IC 50 of 1 . 3 and 1 . 4 μ M , respectively ( Schwab et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , we tested whether the other CAD antihistamines pos - sessed similar ability at concentrations relevant for re - sensitization . In - dicative of MDR1 activity , A549 - MDR cells effectively ef ﬂ uxed the MDR1 substrate Rhodamine123 dye , which was completely inhibited by 2 μ M PSC833 ( MDR1 inhibitor ) and by 50 % by 1 μ M astemizole ( Fig . 3d ; Supplemental Fig . S3 ) . Ebastine and loratadine failed to inhibit thedye exclusionat1 μ Msuggestingthat CAD antihistamines canrevert drug resistance also by mechanisms other than the direct inhibition of the ef ﬂ ux activity of MDR1 ( Fig . 3d ) . 3 . 5 . CAD Antihistamines and Chemotherapy Synergize to Induce Apoptotic and Lysosomal Cell Death To search for MDR1 - independent mechanisms of synergy between CAD antihistamines and chemotherapy , we tested whether low non - toxic concentrations of CAD antihistamines enhanced the inhibitory ef - fect of chemotherapy on clonogenic potential of NSCLC cells . Indeed , sub - micromolar concentrations of astemizole , ebastine , loratadine and terfenadine potentiated the inhibitory effect of vinorelbine on colony formation of NCI - H1299 cells , whereas clemastine , desloratadine and fexofenadine failed to do so ( Fig . 4a ) . Similarly , astemizole , but not fexofenadine , sensitized NCI - H661 cells to subtoxic concentration of vinorelbine or cisplatin ( Fig . 4b ) . To investigate the mechanisms underlying the synergism between CADs and chemotherapy , we ﬁ rst analyzed lysosomal leakage by counting LGALS1 ( galectin 1 ) - positive lysosomes in NCI - H1299 cells treated with suboptimal concentrations of astemizole and vinorelbine for 24 – 72 h . A non - toxic concentration of astemizole triggered a tran - sient ( 24 – 48 h ) accumulation of LGALS1 positive lysosomes , which were clearedat 72h ( Figs . 4c – d ) . Additionofvinorelbineata concentra - tion , which alone killed approximately 20 % of the cells without disturbing lysosomal membrane integrity , enhanced astemizole - in - duced lysosomal damage ( LGALS1 puncta formation ) and inhibited Table 2 Adjusted HRs and 95 % CIs for the mortality of patients with non - localized NSCLC and ≥ 1 prescriptions of indicated CAD antihistamines from three months before until three months after the diagnosis compared with those with ≥ 1 prescriptions of non - CAD anti - histamine ( cetirizine or fexofenadine ) .

Ellegaard et al . / EBioMedicine 9 ( 2016 ) 130 – 139 the clearance of damaged lysosomes resulting in signi ﬁ cantly enhanced cell death ( Figs . 4c – e ) . Contrary to CAD - induced cell death that is inde - pendent of caspases ( Fig . 1f ) , the pan - caspase inhibitor z - VAD - fmk inhibited approximately 60 % of the cell death induced by vinorelbine alone or in combination with astemizole ( Fig . 4e ) . These data suggest that the synergistic effect of astemizole and vinorelbine in NCI - H1299 cells results from the enhancement of both lysosomal and caspase - de - pendent cell death pathways . 4 . Discussion Data presented above suggest that addition of clinically relevant doses of well - tolerated CAD antihistamines to the standard cancer che - motherapy regiment improves cancer prognosis . This conclusion is based on statistically signi ﬁ cant inverse associations between the use of loratadine , or the use of either loratadine or astemizole , and all - cause mortality among Danish patients with non - localized NSCLC or any non - localized cancer , respectively . Furthermore , ebastine use was associated with reduced all - cause mortality , albeit not statistically sig - ni ﬁ cant , in both study cohorts . Importantly , use of non - CAD antihista - mines , fexofenadine and cetirizine , which have similar antihistamine effects and are prescribed for similar indications as CAD antihistamines , did not affect cancer mortality . Thus , the observed positive effectof CAD antihistamines is likely to be related to their CAD structure rather than their antihistamine effect or the disease they have been prescribed for . Our pharmacoepidemiological study was inspired by the ability of CAD antihistamines to induce cancer - speci ﬁ c lysosomal cell death in vitro . The putative clinical bene ﬁ t of CAD antihistamines is , however , Fig . 3 . TheabilityofCADantihistaminestore - sensitizeMDRcancercellstochemotherapy .

Ellegaard et al . / EBioMedicine 9 ( 2016 ) 130 – 139 not likely to be due to their direct cytotoxicity alone . Their LC 50 and GI 50 values are signi ﬁ cantly higher than reported plasma concentrations achieved with recommended doses of these drugs , which range from undetectable for ebastine to 11 nM for astemizole and 68 nM for loratadine ( Del Cuvillo et al . , 2006 ) . Instead , their ability to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy and revert MDR phenotype at sub - micro - molar concentrations may explain the positive effects observed in our register - based study . This assumption is supported by the subgroup analyses showing that patients with records of chemotherapy within six months following the diagnosis of non - localized cancer or within three months of the diagnosis of non - localized NSCLC had additionally reduced HRs for all - cause mortality .

Ellegaard et al . / EBioMedicine 9 ( 2016 ) 130 – 139 distribution ( V D ) ranging from 48 to over 100 L / kg for astemizole ( Tillement , 2000 ) , loratadine ( Tillement , 2000 ) and ebastine ( Del Cuvillo et al . , 2006 ) ( Table 3 ) . High V D values re ﬂ ect the ef ﬁ cient distri - bution of drugs to tissues . Accordingly , the reported concentrations of astemizole in e . g . lungs , kidneys , liver and pancreasof Beagle dogs treat - ed for six weeks with 1 mg / kg astemizole are over 1000 - fold higher than the corresponding plasma concentrations ( Tillement , 2000 , Michiels et al . , 1986 ) . Notably , astemizole and other CADs , which per de ﬁ nition are weak bases , are likely to accumulate in acidic tumors even more ef ﬁ ciently than in healthy tissues with neutral pH . Data for tissue distribution of loratadine and ebastine are unfortunately not available , but their higher V D values suggest even more ef ﬁ cient tissue distribution than observed for astemizole . On the other hand , the ap - proximately 50 - fold lower V D ( Tillement , 2000 ) and less ef ﬁ cient tissue distribution of terfenadine ( Leeson et al . , 1982 ) may explain the dis - crepancy between its potent anti - cancer activity in vitro and lack of ef - fect in the pharmacoepidemilogical study . Contrary to the other CADs studied here , clemastine usewas associated with increased cancer mor - tality . Notably , clemastine is commonly used in prevention and treat - ment of hypersensitivity reactions associated with cancer therapy at Danish hospitals and its use increased over six - fold after cancer diagno - sis in our patient cohort . Such a prescription bias towards high - risk pa - tients may thus explain the poor prognosis associated with the use of clemastine . It should also be noted that clemastine has a relatively low V D value ( Schran et al . , 1996 ) ( Table 3 ) , and its ability to augment che - motherapy in parental and MDR cancer cells in vitro is inferior to that of astemizole , loratadine and ebastine . Over - the - counter sale of loratadine ( b 35 % of the total sale ) and ebastine ( b 25 % ) could create another po - tential source of bias . Such exposure misclassi ﬁ cation is , however , con - sidered negligible . Taken together , the data presented here suggest that repurposing of safe and inexpensive CAD antihistamines to cancer therapy may en - hance the anti - neoplastic response of chemotherapy especially in the case of microtubule - disturbing drugs . Further studies addressing the dose - responses and tissue distribution of CAD antihistamines and ef ﬁ - cacy of various treatment combinations in pre - clinical animal models will hopefully pave the way for subsequent clinical trials in patients with distant stage NSCLC as well as other advanced cancers in near future .
