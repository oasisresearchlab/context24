bacterial ( 62 , 89 ) proteins controlling host cell entry . Nearly 50 % of enzymes contain sensitive histidine residues within their active sites ( 93 ) , and the structur - al mechanisms for how physiologically relevant changes in pH regulate the enzymatic activity of the bacterial type III adenylyl cyclase ( 100 ) , (cid:5) - secretase ( 32 ) , and glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase ( GART ) ( 67 ) have been examined . Regulation by pH Sensors and Signaling Modes One advantage of using protons for signaling and reg - ulation as opposed to posttranslational modifications or cofactors is the potential for extremely rapid tempo - ral responses . Protons can diffuse through water exceptionally quickly ( “Grotthuss diffusion , ” made possible in part by the quantum mechanical tunneling ability of protons ) , possibly facilitated by short - range motion in proteins ( 58 ) . The variation of pH among subcellular locales makes possible spatial regulation as well . Protons also present an elegant means of reg - ulating protein activity and interactions . A proton is an exceptionally small single subatomic particle that can induce a reversible chemical change resulting in sub - stantial electrostatic perturbation , which can drive changes in protein structure , dynamics , and interac - tions . As a regulator of protein function , protons can be used in multiple signaling modes . The Bohr effect of pH - driven changes in the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen binding is the classic example of a single - site , proton - induced allosteric regulation . The effect of pH is mediated by a His - Asp salt bridge ( His146 and Asp94 in human hemoglobin ) , which is disrupted when His146 is deprotonated at increased pH . However , electrostatic interactions , particularly due to chloride binding , also affect proton exchange at His146 ( reviewed in Ref . 53 ) . Cooperativity involving binding of ligands or electro - static coupling of multiple proton binding sites play piv - otal roles in pH sensing ( 28 , 95 , 115 ) . An example of thermodynamic linkage is the HIV - 1 protease , which is required for the formation of mature virions . 30 1548 - 9213 / 05 8 . 00 ©2006 Int . Union Physiol . Sci . / Am . Physiol . Soc . Changes in intracellular pH ( pH i ) regulate a number of normal and pathological cell processes . Increases in pH i are permissive for growth factor - induced cell pro - liferation ( 22 , 40 , 80 ) , cell cycle progression ( 82 , 106 ) , and differentiation ( 12 , 107 , 112 ) and are necessary for haptokinetic migration ( 21 , 44 , 47 , 85 , 96 ) and ame - boid chemotaxis ( 78 , 86 , 94 , 108 ) . Additionally , increased cytosolic pH is a hallmark of transformed cells from different tissue origins and genetic back - grounds , making it a common characteristic of distinct cancers ( 16 , 36 ) and possibly a common critical driv - ing force for tumor progression ( 81 , 85 ) . A decrease in cytosolic pH promotes caspase - dependent and - inde - pendent apoptosis ( 46 , 59 , 119 ) , and in response to some apoptotic signals precedes mitochondrial dys - function ( 52 ) . Because cytosolic pH homeostasis is tightly regulated ( 11 ) , dramatic differences in cell behavior are driven by relatively small changes in pH i . The increased pH i in transformed cells is only 0 . 3 – 0 . 5 pH units greater than in normal cells , which is gener - ally maintained at ~ 7 . 2 , and apoptosis is triggered at 0 . 3 – 0 . 4 pH units lower than normal . Despite established effects of small changes in pH i on diverse cell functions , our understanding of how these changes affect proteins and macromolecular assemblies driving specific cell processes is limited . The objective of this review is to present design princi - ples , current modeling predictions , and examples of what we term “pH sensors , ” or proteins that have activ - ities or ligand - binding affinities that are sensitive to small , physiologically relevant changes in pH . Although changes in solvent pH affect the ionization state of all weak acids and bases , and all cellular pro - teins contain amino acids with titratable groups , only select proteins appear to be bonafide pH sensors . New insights from protein structures and biomolecular simulations ( 64 ) are beginning to reveal the structural basis for tight coupling between protonation state and protein conformation . Exquisitely pH - sensitive con - formational switches have been shown to regulate activity of ion ( reviewed in Ref . 98 ) and water ( 102 ) channels , affinity of proteins for binding actin fila - ments ( 14 , 33 , 79 , 110 ) , and activity of viral ( 15 , 41 ) and REVIEWS PPHHYYSSIIOOLLOOGGYY 2222 : : 3300 – – 3399 , , 22000077 ; ; 1100 . . 11115522 / / pphhyyssiiooll . . 0000003355 . . 22000066 Intracellular pH Sensors : Design Principles and Functional Significance Jyoti Srivastava , 1 Diane L .

However , our understanding of how physiological changes in pH affect protein conformations and macromolecular assemblies is limit - ed . We present design principles , current modeling predictions , and examples of pH sensors or proteins that have activities or ligand - binding affinities that are regulated by changes in intracellular pH . b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on J un e 18 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys i o l og y on li ne . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m HIV - 1 protease undergoes a shift in the pKa of a catalyt - ic aspartyl dyad when bound to inhibitors ( 105 ) , and deprotonation of the dyad at increased pH dramatically increases the affinity of HIV - 1 protease for cationic inhibitors ( 39 ) . Also , the mammalian prion protein PrP C contains unique octapeptide repeats ( PHGGGWGQ ) in which histidines function as pH sensors . At neutral and basic pH , deprotonated His in the octapeptide repeats trigger aggregation and increased affinity for Cu 2 + bind - ing to the repeat domains ( FIGURE 1 ) ( 63 , 120 ) . However , Cu 2 + binding generates a gain of pH sensitivi - ty for aggregation . The protonation state of coordinating side chains also affects positive cooperativity , as seen with Ca 2 + binding by the C2 domain ( 57 ) , a membrane targeting module in phospholipase A2 , protein kinase C , and synaptotagmin . Another signaling mode that is becoming increasingly apparent is the role of protons as coincidence regulators with other posttranslational modifications , including phosphorylation or binding of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) . PIP 2 binding could localize a pH sensor to a specific mem - brane domain where its activity or ligand binding affin - ity is regulated by localized membrane H + fluxes . Coincidence regulation with phosphorylation state is seen for cofilin , an actin depolymerizing and severing protein that requires independent events of Ser3 dephosphorylation and His133 protonation for binding actin filaments ( 79 ) . At the cellular level , physiological changes in pH i act as a signaling feedback mechanism controlling intracel - lular cation and osmotic homeostasis . The activity of several plasma membrane transport proteins , including channels , exchangers , and pumps , are pH sensitive . Although mechanisms of pH sensing by transport pro - teins have primarily been inferred from mutagenesis studies , some models have been proposed based on structural data and molecular simulations . In NhaA , a Na - H exchanger in Escherichia coli , its crystal structure ( 38 ) and multiconformation continuum electrostatics calculations ( 75 ) predict pH sensing is achieved by four clusters of electrostatically coupled amino acids with shifted pKa near the funnel , which regulate long - range conformational changes affecting a distinct H + exchange site . Structural data and molecular dynamics simulations have also been used to predict pH gating by the plant aquaporin channel SoPIP2 ; 1 ( 102 ) . Proton sensing is predicted to be achieved by a single histidine residue , His193 , in the second cytoplasmic loop ( D loop ) . Rotation of the protonated His193 side chain forms a salt bridge with Asp28 that anchors a folded D loop underneath the molecule and occludes the pore . His193 is strictly conserved in plant aquaporins and is critical for pH - sensitive gating by the Arabidopsis aqua - porin PIP2 ; 2 ( 103 ) . Hence , channel gating by intracellu - lar protons may be a conserved mechanism in plant aquaporins to coordinate water transport under anoxic stress . In contrast , several mammalian aquaporins are gated by extracellular protons , analogous to acid - sens - ing Ca 2 + and K + channels . Intracellular pH gating by the renal inwardly rectify - ing K + channel Kir1 . 1 ( ROMK ) , which closes in response to pH i < 7 . 0 , acts as a feedback mechanism coupling K + retention during metabolic acidosis . Kir1 . 1 ( ROMK ) gating is exquisitely sensitive to changes in pH i as small as 0 . 2 pH units . The pH sensor , which is structurally distinct from the physical gate for 31 PHYSIOLOGY • Volume 22 • February 2007 • www . physiologyonline . org REVIEWS FIGURE 1 . Structural mechanisms underlying pH regulation of protein function Five examples are presented where X - ray crystal or NMR structures have been obtained at two or more values of pH . These pH values sometimes lie outside the range of physiological pH , due to experimental constraints .

Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) is arguably the most powerful method for studying pH - driven changes in protein structure and dynamics . NMR can provide not only an atomic structure of a protein in solution but also information about conformational heterogeneity and dynamics occurring on a variety of time scales . Because the experiments are performed in solution , pH can be modulated easily . Finally , the pro - tonation and deprotonation of titratable groups can be monitored directly by the proton signals ; in contrast , protons can only be observed in X - ray crystallography experiments at very high resolution . On the other hand , one major limitation of NMR is that interpretation of the spectra becomes more diffi - cult as the size of the protein increases , and in practice most NMR studies have been limited to proteins of rel - atively modest ( < 150 amino acids , monomeric ) size . NMR studies of pH - sensitive proteins or protein frag - ments in this size range have provided some of the most detailed information on the structural basis of pH regulation . As discussed above , cofilin is a pH - sen - sitive actin regulatory protein . Pope et al . ( 79 ) obtained the structure of human cofilin by NMR and monitored conformational changes as the pH was var - ied between 6 and 8 . NMR methods have also been used to study the pH - dependent behavior of mam - malian prion protein ( 120 ) , low - density lipoprotein receptor ( 6 , 7 ) , receptor - associated protein ( 49 ) , and villin headpiece ( 33 , 99 ) . Computational Tools and Theoretical Insights The pKa of a protonatable group is defined as the pH at which it is 50 % protonated . The titration of any sin - gle protonatable group is governed by the Henderson - Hasselbach equation , which can be written as < x > = ( 10 pKa – pH ) / ( 1 + 10 pKa – pH ) where < x > is the fractional protonation of the titratable group with a given pKa . This equation describes a sigmoidal titration curve . Titrating groups found in the standard 20 amino acids are shown in FIGURE 2 . There are two primary challenges in studying the titration behavior of proteins in solution . The first is that the pKa values of titratable groups vary depending on their environment in the protein . That is , the pKa of , e . g . , a Glu side chain can vary by several units depending on where in the protein it is found . The side chain of free glutamate in solution is ~ 4 , too low to be relevant to almost all biological environments . In a 32 PHYSIOLOGY • Volume 22 • February 2007 • www . physiologyonline . org channel closure , is thought to include a triad of a lysine residue , Lys80 , in the first transmembrane domain , and spatially close Arg41 and Arg311 in the NH 2 - and COOH - terminal cytoplasmic domains , respectively ( reviewed in Ref . 90 ) . Lys80 has a down - shifted pKa , and its protonation is predicted to induce a conformational change resulting in pore closure . However , Lys80 is not conserved in some pH - sensitive Kir1 . 1 orthologs , and molecular dynamics simulations predict it is not solvent accessible ( 84 ) , hence its criti - cal role in pH - gating of ROMK channels is controver - sial . Of clinical significance are naturally occurring mutations in Kir1 . 1 that shift pH gating in patients with hyperprostaglandin E syndrome ( referred to as Bartter Syndrome ) , a hereditary renal tubulopathy associated with excessive salt loss . Structural Biology of pH Regulation In some cases , it has been possible to obtain multiple X - ray crystal structures of a protein at varying pH , REVIEWS FIGURE 2 . Titratable groups commonly found in proteins The pKa listed are for free amino acids , and the pKa of these groups can vary substantial - ly in proteins . The neutral form of the histidine side chain can exist in either of two tau - tomeric states , with the proton on either nitrogen in the ring ( delta or epsilon ) . b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on J un e 18 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys i o l og y on li ne . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m protein , however , the pKa can vary widely . The two key parameters are the electrostatic potential and solvent accessibility . If a Glu is found in a region of positive electrostatic potential ( e . g . , near Lys or Arg side chains ) , the negatively charged form is stabilized , which has the effect of lowering the pKa . Conversely , negative electrostatic potential increases the pKa . Favorable interactions between the side chain and water also help to stabilize the charged form , and so burying a Glu in the interior of a protein can shift the pKa upward . Similar arguments apply to all of the titratable side chains . The second major challenge in understanding pH titrations of proteins is that they generally contain multiple titratable groups . If these groups are widely separated ( ~ 25 Å ) , then they may titrate independent - ly . However , when two or more titrating groups are spatially close , and particularly when they have similar pKa values , more complicated titration behavior can result . Put simply , the protonation state of each titrat - ing group can affect the pKa ( and hence the most probable protonation state ) of all of the other titrating groups due to either the direct electrostatic interac - tions discussed above or conformational changes driven by the changes in protonation state . These interactions between titrating sites can lead to com - plex , nonsigmoidal titration curves . This also implies that interpreting the effects of mutating titratable residues ( e . g . , to Ala ) can be complicated , because the elimination of a titratable group can impact the titra - tion of other nearby groups . That is , any amino acid substitution that eliminates or introduces a charged group can perturb the pKa of nearby titratable groups , and this effect should be considered when interpreting the results of mutagenesis in studies of pH - dependent properties of proteins . Ullmann and coworkers have published an elegant mathematical formalism for understanding the complex titration behavior of mul - tiple interacting groups ( 45 , 76 ) . A number of computer programs have been devel - oped to predict the titration behavior of proteins given their structure . One of the challenges in making such predictions is the treatment of water , and for computa - tional efficiency most widely used methods treat water using continuum electrostatics rather than as discrete solvent molecules . The first generation of such pro - grams predicted the titration behavior based on the assumption that the protein remained in a single static conformation . In many cases , such methods could cor - rectly predict qualitative behaviors , such as the direc - tion of pKa shifts for individual side chains . To improve the quantitative accuracy , much effort has been direct - ed toward the development of methods that explicitly treat proteins as conformationally flexible ( 3 , 10 , 54 , 92 , 109 , 118 , 123 ) . Some of these methods only treat con - formational changes in protein side chains , keeping the backbone fixed ( 30 , 113 ) . A new generation of pro - grams , which are referred to as constant - pH molecular dynamics ( 27 , 42 , 51 , 55 , 64 , 65 ) and include versions of the widely used AMBER and CHARMM packages , relaxes this restriction and treats the entire protein as flexible , moving under Newton’s equations of motion . The protonation states are allowed to vary during the simulation in a way that is thermodynamically consis - tent with the specified pH . These programs hold the promise of providing a detailed understanding of how pH can regulate protein activity . The major limitation , as with any molecular dynamics methods , is that the fundamental time step in the simulation is ~ 1 fs , which means that it is difficult to study pH - driven conforma - tional changes that occur on time scales longer than a few microseconds . Computational studies using these methods have helped to develop models for the pH - dependent behavior of human prion protein ( 48 ) , GART ( 66 , 67 ) , and HIV - 1 protease ( 105 ) . Overall , however , there has been relatively little computational work to elucidate the atomic - level mechanisms of pH regulation . The increasing sophistication of the computational tools suggests that it should be possible to do so , in con - junction with experiments that test the computational predictions . A Closer Look at the Role of pH Sensors in Selective pH - Dependent Processes We examine in more detail pH sensors regulating two processes : actin filament dynamics in cell migration and viral and bacterial pathogenesis . These examples demonstrate that multiple pH sensors can act collec - tively to control a specific cell response . They also exemplify distinct modes of regulation , including sin - gle - site allosteric modulation , cooperativity , and coin - cidence . Moreover , they include proteins regulated by changes in cytosolic pH of 0 . 5 or less pH units ( for actin filament dynamics ) compared with proteins reg - ulated by larger pH gradients across the endosome or phagosome membrane ( viral and bacterial pH sensors regulating host cell entry and virulence ) . pH sensors regulating actin filament dynamics in cell migration An increase in pH i is an evolutionarily conserved but poorly understood mechanism necessary for directed cell migration . Early work on the fertilization of sea urchin eggs ( 5 ) , the acrosomal reaction in Ecinoderm sperm cells ( 101 ) , and the motility of Ascaris sperm cells ( 43 ) indicated that transient increases in pH i are necessary for cytoskeletal assemblies driving polarity and movement . Increased pH i also is necessary for polarity and directed migration of mammalian fibrob - lasts ( 21 , 96 ) and epithelial cells ( 44 , 47 , 85 ) and for chemotaxis of neutrophils ( 94 ) , leukocytes ( 86 ) , and Dictyostelium cells ( 78 , 108 ) . Regulation of cell motili - ty by changes in pH i is a mechanism to temporally and 33 PHYSIOLOGY • Volume 22 • February 2007 • www . physiologyonline . org REVIEWS b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on J un e 18 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys i o l og y on li ne . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m determined , functional data indicate that the pH - sen - sitive switch to activate cofilin occurs between pH i 6 . 9 and 7 . 2 , which suggests a slightly upshifted pKa . With increasing pH and breakage of the salt bridge , signifi - cant chemical shift perturbations are seen for a num - ber of nearby residues ( 79 ) . However , pH - dependent conformational changes in the F site are more subtle compared with phosphorylation - dependent changes in the G site . Computational modeling that we per - formed using constant - pH molecular dynamics simu - lations also indicates that conformational changes between pH 6 . 5 and 8 . 0 are minor and largely confined to the immediate vicinity of His133 ( FIGURE 3 ) . His133 is located among the residues that define the F site , and hence changing the fractional protonation of this titrating residue can directly modulate actin bind - ing without driving large conformational changes . Increased pH i as a coincidence activator of cofilin is an elegant means to generate rapid bursts of localized actin assembly . Dephosphorylated cofilin is highly localized to the submembranous region of protrusions or lamellipodia ( 19 ) where it could be “primed” for activation by increased H + efflux at the plasma mem - brane . However , cofilin isoforms and related proteins have evolved differences in pH sensitivity . Of the three mammalian cofilins , ADF has a significantly higher activity with increasing pH . Actophorin , the amoebae cofilin , lacks a COOH - terminal His , and its activity is not pH - sensitive ( 56 ) , and the cofilin - related yeast twinfilin has pH - dependent severing activity , but activity increases with decreasing pH ( 68 ) . These vari - ations can be exploited in future studies to understand the dynamics of sensitive pH - dependent conforma - tional changes . Villin . Villin , a member of the gelsolin superfamily , bundles actin filaments to maintain epithelial brush border organization and to promote cell migration . The actin - binding “headpiece” domain at the COOH terminus of villin is a conserved module in more than 20 other proteins and has pH - dependent affinity for binding actin filaments . As determined by circular dichroism spectra , NMR , and 1 H / 2 H amide exchange ( 33 , 99 , 110 ) , a pH - sensitive switch induces folding of the NH 2 terminus of villin headpiece , which is unstructured at pH lower than 6 . 5 . Folding of the NH 2 terminus stabilizes the helix - bundled COOH terminus that contains an actin binding site . His41 , the only his - tidine in chicken villin headpiece ( HP67 ) , has a down - shifted pKa . With a positively charged His imidazole ring at lower pH , hydrophobic packing is destabilized , and the NH 2 terminus is unfolded ( 99 , 110 ) . Whether headpiece functions as a physiological pH sensor is uncertain because the NH 2 terminus is fully folded at pH 6 . 5 . However , pH - dependent conformational changes and actin binding have been determined only for isolated headpiece , and it is unknown whether a shift in pH sensitivity occurs when headpiece is part of a larger structure . 34 PHYSIOLOGY • Volume 22 • February 2007 • www . physiologyonline . org spatially control rapid remodeling of cytoskeletal assemblies at the cell front , where several plasma membrane ion transport proteins regulating pH i are localized , including the Na - H exchanger NHE1 ( 21 , 22 , 91 ) , the Na - HCO 3 cotransporter NBC1 ( 91 ) , and the V - ATPase ( 87 ) . Physiological changes in pH i regulate three events in the migratory cycle : actin filament assembly ( 78 ) , bundling of actin filaments ( 22 , 77 ) , and cell - substrate adhesion ( 21 , 44 ) . Proteins regulat - ing each of these events , cofilin , villin , and talin , respectively , are candidate pH sensors . Cofilin . Most members of the cofilin superfamily , including cofilin , actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) , destrin , and twinfilin , bind , depolymerize and sever actin filaments with dependence on physiological changes in pH i . Cofilin severing activity is necessary to generate a rapid ( ~ 1 min ) increase in actin free barbed ( + ) ends ( 69 ) , which promotes the assembly of new actin filaments that drive membrane protrusion at the leading edge and cell migration . Functional ( 9 , 37 , 121 ) and structural ( 13 , 79 ) data suggest that mam - malian cofilin is a coincidence detector requiring two independent activation steps : dephosphorylation of Ser3 by the phosphatases Slingshot ( 73 ) or chronophin ( 31 ) , and deprotonation of His133 . Cofilin severs actin filaments by changing the filament helical twist ( 61 ) , which requires binding actin at two sites : an NH 2 - terminal G site and a COOH - terminal F site . NMR analysis and molecular dynamics simulations of human cofilin ( 79 ) suggest that the F site is retained in a conformation with decreased affinity for actin by a solvent - exposed salt bridge between a protonated His133 imidazole ring and a carboxylate group in Asp98 . Although the pKa of His133 has not been REVIEWS FIGURE 3 . Structures of human cofilin obtained from constant - pH simulations at pH 6 . 5 ( cyan ) and 8 . 0 ( magenta ) The initial structure for the simulations was the NMR structure of Pope and coworkers ( 79 ) , and the molecular dynamic simulations were performed with Amber ( 65 ) . Only minor conformational changes are observed after 5 ns of simulation . The most likely explanation for the pH - dependent actin binding is direct modulation of the binding affinity by the protonation state of His133 , which is located in one of the cofilin - actin interfaces . b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on J un e 18 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys i o l og y on li ne . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Talin . Dynamic turnover of cell - substrate or focal adhesions at the cell front is necessary for efficient haptokinetic cell movement and is attenuated at pHi < 7 . 2 ( 21 ) . The stability of focal adhesions is in part reg - ulated by the focal adhesion - associated protein talin ( 18 ) , which binds integrins and F - actin to tether the actin cytoskeleton to integrin adhesion complexes . Two distinct pH - dependent processes could disrupt the integrin - talin - actin linkage to permit focal adhe - sion turnover with small increases in pH i . One is cleav - age of the mid - region rod domain of talin by the cys - teine protease calpain ( 29 ) , which is activated with increased pH i ( 114 ) . Another is pH - sensitive actin binding by the COOH terminal I / LWEQ domain of talin . Increasing pH > 7 . 0 lowers the affinity for actin binding by the I / LWEQ domain ( 50 , 88 ) , which might disrupt the talin - actin linkage and allow focal adhe - sion turnover . In contrast , high - affinity binding of actin by talin at pH i < 7 . 0 would act like a brake to sta - bilize the linkage and inhibit turnover . Although the structure of the COOH - terminal domain of talin has not been determined , we constructed a homology model of the I / LWEQ domain ( FIGURE 4 ) based on the solved structure of the corresponding domain in huntingtin - interacting protein ( Hip ) 1R . Computational pKa prediction [ MCCE ( Multi - Conformation Continuum Electrostatics ) ] ( 2 ) using this model revealed that five amino acids have pKa near the physiological range . All five are clustered at one end of the helix - bundled I / LWEQ domain ; only one is a His , and the rest are Glu / Asp with predicted upshifted pKa . How or whether this cluster acts as a pH sensor to modulate the affinity for actin binding remains to be determined . The I / LWEQ domain is a conserved actin - binding module ( 60 ) also present in Sla2 , a yeast protein necessary for cytoskeletal polari - ty , and the metazoan Sla2 homologs Hip1 , the polyg - lutamine - containing protein that binds huntingtin and is associated with Huntington disease , and Hip1R , which does not bind huntingtin but binds clathrin to regulate endosome and Golgi trafficking . Viral and bacterial pH sensors in host cell entry and virulence Most viral and bacterial pH sensors are activated at low pH , which likely is an adaptation to take advan - tage of the host uptake system ( 17 ) . In influenza A , two of the three integral membrane proteins necessary for viral uptake , hemagglutinin ( HA ) and the M2 channel , are pH sensors . At neutral pH , HA monomers are apo - lar , containing an NH 2 - terminal hydrophobic “fusion peptide” packed antiparallel to a core (cid:6) - helical stem domain and a COOH - terminal transmembrane anchor ( FIGURE 1 ) . The acidic environment of the host cell endosome triggers a fusiogenic conformation of HA , which X - ray crystallography reveals includes movement of the NH 2 terminus of > 100 Å to align at the top of the stem domain . ( FIGURE 1 ) ( 15 ) . After fusion , activation of M2 , a pH - gated H + channel , is necessary to acidify the virion as a prerequisite for uncoating . At neutral pH out , the channel is closed , and data from NMR analysis ( 72 ) , UV resonance Raman spectroscopy ( 74 ) , and molecular dynamics simula - tions ( 41 ) suggest that , when His37 is uncharged , the bulky indole side chain of Trp41 is oriented to occlude the channel pore . His37 has a predicted downshifted pKa of 5 . 6 , and with the acidic pH out in the endosome charged His37 allows rotation of Trp41 for channel opening and H + efflux into the virion . Kass and Arkin ( 41 ) predict that the gating model for M2 may be appli - cable to a number of pH - sensitive K + channels . The low endosomal or phagosomal pH also activates a number of pore - forming bacterial toxins . The 35 PHYSIOLOGY • Volume 22 • February 2007 • www . physiologyonline . org REVIEWS FIGURE 4 .

We conclude by posing some speculative ques - tions that we hope may be answered by future work . 1 ) What are the principles of ultrasensitive pH switches in proteins ? In the cytosol , pH varies only within a small range . In vitro , proteins like phospho - fructokinase have striking changes in activity over very small ranges of pH ( a few tenths of a pH unit ) ( 104 ) . Most proteins , however , do not show ultra - sensitivity to pH , despite the presence of multiple titrating groups in most cases , and from a theoretical perspective ultrasen - sitive pH sensing is not well understood . It seems clear that multiple strongly interacting titrating groups must function together to form an ultrasensitive pH switch . Conformational changes in response to protonation state changes likely also play a role . Finally , the activity or binding properties of a protein may depend condi - tionally on the protonation states of multiple titrating groups , which can lead to more sensitive pH switching . Beyond these simple principles , however , little is understood . The ultimate test would be to design ultra - sensitive pH switching into a protein de novo . 2 ) Do cells use protons to dynamically regulate pro - tein function in the cytosol ? The role of pH in regulat - ing protein activity in acidic subcellular compart - ments such as endosomes is relatively well under - stood . The dynamic pH changes in the cytosol are smaller , but increasing evidence , reviewed above , sug - gests that these changes have important cellular con - sequences , including for cell migration , tumor pro - gression , and apoptosis . However , our understanding of the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying this pH regulation remains fragmentary . 3 ) Do protons act cooperatively with other signaling mechanisms , such as posttranslational phosphoryla - tion ? At a structural level , the addition of a negatively charged phosphate can perturb the pKa of titrating groups ; thus it is conceivable that phosphorylation ( or dephosphorylation ) could be required for pH - sensi - tive behavior of a particular protein . Even more specu - latively , the phosphate group itself has a pKa of ~ 6 . 5 , roughly the same as histidine , and so the effects of phosphorylation could be pH sensitive ( 116 ) . Conversely , structural changes induced by pH could promote phosphorylation , e . g . , by making the site of phosphorylation more accessible to a kinase .

Alpha - barrel - forming toxins , such as colicin ( 70 ) and diphtheria toxin ( 17 ) , are predicted to form pores by using helical hairpins . They share no significant sequence homology but have remarkable structural homology and a conserved pH - dependent conformational switch . Soluble forms con - tain layers of buried (cid:6) - helices at neutral pH that unfold at low pH to a coiled , insertion - competent structure . In contrast , (cid:5) - barrel - forming toxins assemble as homo - oligomers to form channels and do not share a com - mon pH - activated mechanism . Listeriolysin O , a cytolysin , is active at pH < 6 but unfolded at neutral pH because a (cid:5) - hairpin containing a triad of acidic residues ( Asp208 , Glu247 , Asp320 ) is destabilized ( 89 ) . Alpha - hemolysin of Staphylococcus auerus self assem - bles at cell membranes and channel conductance increases at pH 6 compared with pH 7 . Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that protonation of seven solvent - exposed His144 residues in the oligomer increases channel conductance ( 1 ) . Clinical Perspectives The pH sensors regulated with normal pH i homeostasis likely also play roles in pathologies associated with deregulated pH i , as seen in transformed or apoptotic cells . Understanding pH - sensitive regulation at the atomic level facilitates the rational design of therapeu - tics , as recently described in targeting the pH - sensitive HIV - 1 protease ( 4 ) . Gain or loss of pH sensor function can drive pathologies or be engineered to resist pathologies . In some patients with pediatric adrenal cortical carcinoma ( ACC ) , a naturally occurring muta - tion in the tumor suppressor protein p53 results in a gain of pH sensor function ( 25 ) . In wild - type p53 , Arg337 and Asp352 from different monomers form a salt bridge across helix interfaces that stabilizes tetramer formation necessary for DNA binding and tumor suppressor function . Because side chains in these residues are protonated between pH 5 and 9 ( FIGURE 2 ) , the salt bridge and p53 function are rela - tively pH insensitive . However , in ACC , an Arg337His substitution results in a salt bridge that is sensitive to physiological changes in pH . With increased pH i , per - haps during development , deprotonation of His337 dis - rupts the salt bridge , which destabilizes tetramer assembly . Engineering predictable pH - switches is a rel - atively unexplored but feasible therapeutic approach , as described recently for a histidine switch in troponin designed to protect against myocardial ischemia ( 20 ) .
