In eukaryotes , ESCRT - III displays 22 a remarkable molecular diversity in its subunits which may have been acquired through 23 evolution to perform novel cellular functions . Here , we describe and characterize a novel 24 ESCRT - III polymer initiated by the subunit Vps60 . Membrane - bound Vps60 polymers recruit 25 ESCRT - III subunits Vps2 , Vps24 , Did2 and Ist1 , and undergo polymer turnover powered by 26 the ATPase Vps4 . Snf7 - and Vps60 filaments can coexist on membranes without interacting . 27 Their nucleation , polymerization and recruitment of downstream subunits remains unaffected 28 by the presence of the respective other polymer . Taken together , our results suggest Vps60 and 29 Snf7 form distinct ESCRT - III polymers , which overall , supports the notion of evolutionary 30 diversification of ESCRT - III assemblies to perform specific cellular functions . 31 32 Introduction 33 Lipid membranes are a hallmark of living cells . To maintain functionality , they require 34 constant remodeling by dedicated machineries like the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required 35 for Transport - III ( ESCRT - III ) . Presumed to be the first membrane remodeling machinery to 36 have evolved 1 , 2 , ESCRT - III acts on virtually all cellular membranes to promote membrane 37 fission from within membrane necks , a process that is essential for many cellular functions 38 such as formation of intralumenal vesicles ( ILVs ) from endosomal membranes , cytokinetic 39 abscission of the plasma membrane , reformation of the nuclear envelope , and closure of 40 autophagosomes 3 – 5 . Moreover , ESCRT - III catalyzes budding of various virions in eukaryotes 41 and archaea 6 – 11 and functions in repairing lipid membranes , as shown for the eukaryotic and 42 bacterial plasma , lysosomal , nuclear and plastid membranes 2 , 12 – 18 , a function that is essential 43 to sustain vacuolar confinement of pathogens during certain infections 19 , 20 . Unlike other 44 membrane remodeling machineries , ESCRT - III can also function with a reverse orientation 45 promoting membrane fission from the outside of membrane necks during release of 46 peroxisomes , recycling of endosomes and lipid droplet formation 21 – 23 . Despite its ubiquitous 47 role in vital functions , the mechanism by which ESCRT - III performs membrane remodeling 48 and the machinery’s adaptation to its various cellular functions is not fully understood . 49 Canonically recruited to endosomal membranes by ESCRT - II , ESCRT - III assembly 50 starts with Vps20 ( CHMP6 ) followed by subunits Snf7 ( CHMP4B ) , Vps2 ( CHMP2A ) and 51 Vps24 ( CHMP3 ) before being likely completed by subunits Did2 ( CHMP1B ) and Ist1 ( IST1 ) . 52 Besides the canonical pathway , other nucleators such as Bro1 ( ALIX ) and Chm7 ( CHMP7 ) 53 can recruit ESCRT - III to diverse cellular membranes 24 – 29 . Vps2 and Vps24 as well as Vps2 54 and Did2 bind Snf7 synergistically and then recruit the AAA - ATPase Vps4 30 – 36 , which induces 55 subunit turnover within ESCRT - III polymers promoting either disassembly 37 – 39 , growth 40 or 56 sequential subunit polymerization 41 . In cells , Vps4 - dependent polymer remodeling is 57 indispensable for ESCRT - III function 40 , 42 , 43 . Upon recruitment , ESCRT - III subunits assemble 58 into filaments with diverse stoichiometries and shapes ranging from spirals 44 – 47 to tubular 59 helices 37 , 48 – 51 and spiraling membrane tubes 52 , 53 . Sequential succession of these various 60 ESCRT - III filaments has recently been suggested to promote ESCRT - III mediated membrane 61 remodeling 54 , 55 . 62 Aside from the well characterized core subunits Snf7 , Vps2 and Vps24 , several 63 accessory ESCRT - III subunits have been identified based on a deletion phenotype indicative 64 of disturbed ILVs formation 56 and their secondary structure organization 57 , which is highly 65 conserved among ESCRT - III proteins even across species . As one of those accessory subunits , 66 the function of Vps60 / Mos10 ( CHMP5 ) , though briefly associated with ESCRT - III 67 disassembly 58 , 59 , remains poorly understood to this day . A recent analysis of genetic 68 interactions between ESCRT - III subunits , however , places Vps60 more central in an 69 interaction network 36 implying potentially a more important function for Vps60 than 70 previously recognized . We thus decided to perform a functional characterization of Vps60 and 71 its interactions with other ESCRT - III subunits as well as the ATPase Vps4 . 72 73 74 Results 75 Vps60 behaves like an early ESCRT - III protein 76 We here set out to characterize the function of ESCRT - III accessory subunit Vps60 . In 77 general , most ESCRT - III subunits or submodules , though to varying degrees , can polymerize 78 into membrane - bound filaments which often depict preferential binding to a specific membrane 79 curvature range 53 , 60 , 61 . Snf7 , the initial ESCRT - III subunit , polymerized spontaneously ( Fig . 80 1A ) on giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUV ) , whereas downstream submodules Vps2 - Vps24 ( Fig . 81 1C ) 61 , 62 and Vps2 - Did2 - Ist1 ( Fig . 1D ) 41 required activation , here provided by an acidic buffer 82 ( Fig . 1A ) , to polymerize . Interestingly , Atto565 - Vps60 bound spontaneously to GUVs ( Fig . 83 1B ) and was , similar to Snf7 , recruited efficiently to flat non - deformable supported lipid 84 bilayers ( SLBs ) ( Fig . S1A - B ) . 85 After establishing Vps60’s affinity for membrane , we next asked whether the protein 86 depicts a membrane curvature - preference . To this end , we injected labeled subunits in the 87 vicinity of membrane nanotubes , the latter made by pulling beads adhered to GUVs with optical 88 tweezers ( see Methods and Fig . 1E ) . The described set - up produces highly curved and flat 89 membranes close to each other , allowing us to evaluate curvature - dependent binding in a wide 90 range . As previously reported , Snf7 bound exclusively flat membrane ( Fig . 1E , S1C ) 61 . 91 Likewise , Vps60 is strongly recruited along the GUV’s flat membrane , whereas only minor 92 binding is observed along the highly curved nanotube ( Fig . 1E , S1E ) . In contrast , both 93 downstream ESCRT - III submodules , Vps2 - Vps24 and Vps2 - Did2 - Ist1 , bind predominantly to 94 highly curved nanotubes ( Fig . 1E , S1D , F ) . 95 Upon membrane binding , all characterized ESCRT - III subunits polymerize into 96 filaments 44 – 47 , 49 , 52 , 63 , 64 . To test if Vps60 behaves likewise , we performed negative stain electron 97 microscopy of large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) incubated with Vps60 . Indeed , Vps60 formed 98 ring - shaped filaments with an average diameter of 18 . 9±3 . 4 nm ( Fig . 1F - H ) similar to ring 99 filaments described for Snf7 60 , 65 . In disagreement with our findings , a recent study reported 100 Vps60 to form wide ranging spirals reminiscent to the Snf7 ones 66 . This discrepancy might 101 arise from different experimental conditions as Banjade and colleagues used higher protein 102 concentration which might help propagating spiral growth . Besides rings , we observed 103 polymers with one inward - curled tip as it would be expected for a spiral initiator ( Fig . 1F , H ) . 104 Snf7 spiral polymers were previously suggested to grow out of ring - shaped filaments upon 105 their spontaneous breakage 60 , 67 . In analogy , curled Vps60 polymers might arise from rupture 106 of ring filaments . The lack of large spirals may potentially be due to filament - specific 107 properties that control its polymerization rate such as filament thickness which is higher for 108 Vps60 - ( 6 . 7 ±1 . 3 nm , Fig . 1G ) than for Snf7 - filaments ( 5 nm ) 65 , 68 . Alternatively , curled 109 filaments might result from ring breakage during sample preparation . We occasionally 110 observed filaments which resemble stacks of rings ( Fig . 1F ) , which might arise from buckling 111 of curled filaments similar to buckling of other ESCRT - III polymers 52 , 65 . 112 In summary , Vps60 depicts characteristics similar to the early ESCRT - III protein Snf7 113 and clearly distinct from the properties of downstream modules Vps2 - Vps24 and Vps2 - Did2 - 114 Ist1 . Curvature preference and filament shape suggest that Vps60 polymers potentially form a 115 membrane binding interface perpendicular to the helical axis like Snf7 - Vps2 - Vps24 and , 116 presumably , Snf7 polymers 52 , 69 ( Fig . 1 H ) . The higher curvature binding preference of later 117 subunits ( Vps2 - Vps24 , Did2 - Ist1 ) cohere with their binding interface parallel to the helical 118 axis 49 , 50 , 63 , 64 ( Fig . 1E ) . 119 120 Spontaneous nucleation of Vps60 on membrane is highly efficient 121 As both , Vps60 and Snf7 , polymerize spontaneously on membrane , we next set out to 122 compare their nucleation capacities . We therefore analyzed the nucleation rate of Atto565 - 123 Vps60 on SLBs ( Fig . 2A - B ) . Below 50 nM , Atto565 - Vps60 nucleation events increased 124 linearly with respect to protein concentration , whereas above 50 nM , their number seemingly 125 increased exponentially . In contrast to the estimated nucleation rate , which was likely 126 underestimated due to overlapping Vps60 puncta , images at concentrations between 150 nM 127 and 250 nM do not suggest a saturation of Vps60 binding . These results point towards Vps60 128 displaying a higher intrinsic nucleation rate on membrane than Snf7 , which , does not 129 spontaneously nucleate below a concentration of 300 nM . Vps60 however does not form 130 growing patches like Snf7 , but instead binding manifests itself in accumulation of puncta ( Fig . 131 2C ) as well as an overall increase of intensity on the membrane . Growth of Snf7 patches was 132 previously explained by breaking of preexisting spirals into multiple smaller spirals from which 133 protein polymerization could continue 60 . Filament breaking thus fuels a chain reaction from a 134 single nucleation event , leading to expanding protein patches formed of hundreds of growing 135 spirals . Observed filament structures of Vps60 ( Fig . 1C ) suggested that filament breaking 136 might occur less frequently and that spiral growth was partially or completely inhibited , 137 explaining why no growing Vps60 - patches were observed ( Fig . 2C ) . 138 Spontaneous nucleation rates for Snf7 ( Fig . S2C - D ) 60 , 70 , 71 can be increased by 139 dedicated ESCRT - III nucleators , like Bro1 and the ESCRT - II - Vps20 complex 26 , 65 , 72 . As Vps60 140 encompasses a Bro1 - interaction domain and as its human homologue CHMP5 binds to the 141 Bro1 - domain containing protein Brox 73 , we wondered if Vps60 is targeted by these nucleators . 142 Addition of Bro1 or ESCRT - II - Vps20 did not increase the Vps60 nucleation rate ( Fig . 2D - E ) 143 nor the overall amount of protein recruited to membrane ( Fig . S2A ) , indicating that Vps60 is 144 not nucleated by these proteins . Vps60 could , however , interact with other ESCRT - III 145 nucleators like Chm7 36 or have other , Vps60 - specific nucleators . As Snf7 membrane 146 recruitment is strongly inhibited by downstream ESCRT - III proteins 68 , we decided to also 147 monitor Vps60 nucleation rates in presence of Vps2 , Vps24 , Did2 , Ist1 and the ATPase Vps4 . 148 However , we did not observe any effect on Vps60’s membrane binding regarding nor its 149 nucleation rate ( Fig . 2D - E ) or its kinetics ( Fig . S2B ) . 150 151 Vps60 and Snf7 display mutually exclusive membrane binding patterns 152 To next address if Vps60 and Snf7 interact upon each other’s polymerization on 153 membrane , we analyzed Vps60’s nucleation on SLBs preincubated with Snf7 , both 154 simultaneously polymerizing and in absence of Snf7 . This revealed Vps60 binding is 155 unaffected by the presence of Snf7 ( Fig . 3A - B , S3A - B ) . Similarly , Snf7 patches grew normally 156 on SLBs preincubated with Vps60 ( Fig . S3C ) . In fact , no colocalization of Snf7 and Vps60 157 was observed , even when the whole membrane surface was covered , indicating that Vps60 - 158 and Snf7 membrane binding are mutually exclusive ( Fig . 3C - D ) . Moreover , incubation of Snf7 - 159 patches with high concentrations of Vps60 resulted in a decrease in Snf7 intensity on the 160 membrane and vice versa ( Fig . S3D - G ) . This suggestsVps60 and Snf7 compete to bind on 161 available membrane surface . 162 Following polymerization , Snf7 filaments recruit downstream subunits starting with 163 Vps2 - Vps24 68 , followed by Vps2 - Did2 and finally Ist1 41 . As Vps60 and Snf7 polymers co - 164 exist on membrane without observable interaction , we asked if Vp60 is recruited into Snf7 - 165 based polymers by downstream subunits . We saw no recruitment of Vps60 to Snf7 polymers 166 nor in the presence of Vps2 , Vps24 , Did2 and Ist1 or when Snf7 - patches were pre - incubated 167 with all the downstream ESCRT - III subunits ( Fig . 3E - F ) . Instead , Vps60 bound membrane 168 identically in the absence or presence of any downstream subunits . Likewise , no integration of 169 Vps60 into Snf7 - polymers was seen upon Vps4 - induced filament turn - over , even in the 170 presence of downstream subunits ( Fig . 3G - H , S3FG ) . 171 In summary , we find Vps60 - and Snf7 polymers to co - exist independently on 172 membranes , and no recruitment of Vps60 to Snf7 - based polymers . Altogether , with its 173 characteristics similar to Snf7 , we wondered if Vps60 might function parallelly to Snf7 as an 174 alternative initiating subunit for a multi - subunit ESCRT - III filament . 175 176 Vps60 polymers recruit downstream ESCRT - III subunits 177 To test our hypothesis , we studied the ESCRT - III subunit binding to SLBs pre - 178 incubated with Vps60 . Indeed , Alexa488 - Vps2 was recruited strongly to Atto565 - Vps60 - 179 covered SLBs in presence of Vps24 and Did2 ( Fig . 4A - B ) . Similarly , we observe Vps60 - 180 mediated membrane binding of Alexa488 - Vps24 in presence of Did2 and Vps2 ( Fig . 4 . C - D ) 181 and recruitment of Alexa488 - Did2 when supplemented with Vps2 and Vps24 ( Fig . 4 E , S4A ) . 182 While Vps2 - Vps24 are recruited to Snf7 polymers , Vps2 - Vps24 was not sufficient for binding 183 to Vps60 - covered SLBs . Interestingly , we observed mild recruitment of Vps2 - Did2 ( Fig . 4A , 184 E ) , indicating that Vps2 - Did2 might act as major a recruitment complex in Vps60 - based 185 polymers , taking over the role of Vps2 - Vps24 in Snf7 - based polymers 62 , 68 . Vps24 , however 186 greatly increased Vps2 - Did2 binding efficiency to Vps60 - covered membranes , indicating that 187 Vps24 might promote Vps2 - Did2 heterofilament formation . As Vps60 and Did2 are reported 188 to interact with Vps4 - cofactor Vta1 58 , 59 , 74 – 77 , we tested if Vta1 affects the recruitment of Vps2 - 189 Did2 - Vps24 to Vps60 , which , however was not the case ( Fig . S4C - D ) . Overall , we do not 190 observe strong colocalization of Vps2 , Vps24 and Did2 with Vps60 puncta , but find that their 191 binding is specifically enhanced in the presence of Vps60 puncta . As Vps60 - filaments do not 192 form patches , it may be that Vps60 serves as a nucleation template for ESCRT - III polymers 193 which can then diffuse along membranes . 194 Alexa488 - Ist1 , analogous to the other ESCRT - III subunits , was specifically recruited 195 to Vps60 - covered vesicles in presence of Vps2 , Vps24 and Did2 ( Fig . 4E , S4B ) . For this 196 experiment , we used GUVs instead of SLBs as Ist1 formed aggregates in solution which 197 sedimented on the SLBs precluding the monitoring of Vps60 - induced binding . Ist1 binding 198 pattern mirrored Did2 recruitment , which is consistent with the previously reported Did2 - Ist1 199 heterodimer formation 78 and suggests Ist1 incorporation into ESCRT - III polymers to only rely 200 on this interaction with Did2 . 201 During Snf7 - mediated recruitment of downstream subunits , distinct recruitment 202 kinetics can be observed , we thus asked if a similar temporal organization can be seen for 203 Vps60 - induced membrane binding . Timelapse imaging of Vps60 - covered SLBs incubated with 204 Vps2 , Vps24 , Did2 and Ist1 revealed a synchronic increase of Vps2 - , Vps24 - and Did2 205 intensity and a slightly delayed increase in Ist1 intensity ( Fig . 4G ) . Overall , this result supports 206 the notion of Vps2 , Did2 and Vps24 together forming the initial recruitment complex ( Fig . 207 4H ) . Subsequently , membrane - bound Did2 then triggers binding of Ist1 to ESCRT - III 208 polymers . Compared to Snf7 - mediated recruitment of Vps2 - Vps24 , binding of downstream 209 subunits is slower when initiated by Vps60 . Indeed , recruitment kinetics of Vps2 - Vps24 - Did2 210 to Vps60 - filaments appears equivalent to Vps2 - Did2 binding to Snf7 - polymers 41 supporting 211 the notion that in Vps60 - mediated assemblies , the two initial waves of subunits ( Vps2 - Vps24 , 212 and then Vps2 - Did2 ) are condensed into a single Vps2 - Vps24 - Did2 wave . 213 214 Vps60 - nucleated ESCRT - III polymers undergo Vps4 - mediated turnover 215 Previous studies demonstrated that ESCRT - III function in cells crucially depends on 216 the ATPase activity of Vps4 , which triggers filament turnover or remodeling 68 , 79 , 80 . To study if 217 the Vps60 - based polymers are likewise remodeled by Vps4 , we performed timelapse imaging 218 of SLBs pre - incubated with Vps60 , Vps2 , Vp24 , Did2 . Upon addition of Ist1 , Vps4 and ATP , 219 Vps2 and Vps24 intensities decreased rapidly , indicating subunit disassembly ( Fig . 5A ) . In 220 contrast , Did2 and Ist1 remained stably bound to membranes when Ist1 was in excess , whereas 221 Vps4 - triggered disassembly occurs in absence of Ist1 ( Fig . 5A , S5A - B ) . These results suggest 222 that Did2 is protected from disassembly by competitive binding of Ist1 , and Vps4 to Did2 ( Fig . 223 S5E ) , a mechanism that we previously proposed for Snf7 - based filaments 41 . As bound Ist1 224 itself undergoes continuous Vps4 - triggred turnover , equilibrium between free Ist1 and Vps4 225 probably determines if Did2 is disassembled or stabilized . 226 Importantly , Vps60 , unlike Snf7 , remained bound to the membrane upon incubation 227 with Vps4 / ATP or Ist1 - Vps4 / ATP ( Fig . 5B ) . Moreover , neither supplementation with Vps4 228 cofactor Vta1 nor Bro1 , which were both suggested to interact with Vps60 74 , 75 , resulted in a 229 disassembly of Vp60 from the membrane ( Fig . 5B ) . Likewise , Vps60 - polymers remained 230 stable with a 10 - fold increased Vps4 concentration , which may overcome a lower sensitivity 231 of Vps60 - filaments towards Vps4 . No direct disassembly of Vps60 by Vps4 in the absence of 232 any downstream ESCRT - III subunits was observed ( data not shown ) . 233 While Vta1 did not promote Vps4 - mediated Vps60 disassembly , it however affected 234 the depolymerization of downstream subunits from Vps60 - based polymers . Indeed , Vta1 235 shifted Ist1’s equilibrium from binding to disassembly ( Fig . S5D , E ) , therefore perturbing Ist1 - 236 mediated protection of Did2 from Vps4 - mediated disassembly ( Fig . S5C , E ) . Additionally , 237 Vps2 and Vps24 depolymerization rates increased ( Fig . 5C - D ) . Intriguingly , in presence of 238 Vta1 , Vps2 and Vps24 depolymerization ( Fig . 5 C - D ) increased a lot more than Did2’s 239 disassembly did ( Fig . 5E , S5C ) . Overall , these results suggest Vta1 potentially targets specific 240 subunits to increase disassembly . Alternatively , Vta1 - binding may primarily increase Vps4 - 241 activity , while differences between subunit disassembly rates may rely more on their 242 accessibility to Vps4 within the polymer structure . While all three subunits display 243 simultaneous and synchronic membrane recruitment , Vta1’s strong influence on Vps2 and 244 Vps24 depolymerization rates compared to Did2 establishes a depolymerization hierarchy 245 between these three subunits . It is tempting to speculate that such Vta1 - induced divergence of 246 disassembly rates could promote the assembly of ESCRT - III subunits in a temporal sequence 247 ( Fig . 5F ) as we have previously shown for Snf7 - based polymers 41 . 248 249 Vps60 - and Snf7 - based polymers exert varying and distinct dynamic properties 250 Vps60 like Snf7 can recruit downstream subunits to form a heteropolymer . To test 251 whether Snf7 - and Vps60 - polmyers compete during subunit recruitment , we incubated 252 Alexa488 - Snf7 - and Atto565 - Vps60 - covered SLBs with Atto647 - Vps2 , Vps24 and Did2 ( Fig . 253 6A ) . As a control , we incubated analogous SLBs with Vps2 - Vps24 , since it binds only to Snf7 - 254 patches and not to Vps60 - covered membranes ( Fig . 6B ) . Upon recruitment of Vps2 - Did2 - 255 Vps24 , Vps2 fluorescence initially colocalized with Snf7 - patches followed by a slower binding 256 to the Vps60 - covered membrane ( Fig . 6A , C , D ) . In contrast , Vps2 - Vps24 only colocalized 257 with Snf7 - patches but no recruitment to Vps60 - covered membrane was observed ( Fig . 6B - D ) . 258 The two - stepped binding of Vps2 - Did2 - Vps24 , likely emerges from an initial recruitment of 259 Vps2 - Vps24 to Snf7 - patches . Thereafter , Vps2 - Did2 - Vp24 bind to Vps60 - filaments by an 260 independent recruitment process following slower kinetics ( Fig . 3G ) , implying that recruitment 261 to Snf7 - or Vps60 - filament occurs independently from each other . To similarly compare 262 disassembly from Snf7 and Vps60 based ESCRT - III polymers , we monitored fluorescence of 263 Vps2 upon addition of Vta1 and Vps4 / ATP to SLBs pre - incubated with labeled - Vps2 , Vps24 , 264 Did2 and Vps60 or Snf7 , respectively ( Fig . 6E ) . Vps2 depolymerization from Vps60 - based 265 polymers was slightly delayed compared to disassembly from Snf7 - based filaments ( Fig . 6E ) . 266 In conclusion , Vps60 - and Snf7 - based polymers assemble and undergo disassembly 267 independently of each other . These results might indicate that both polymers can co - exist in 268 cells in separated functions . In direct comparison , Vps60 - based filaments display delayed 269 assembly and disassembly kinetics which might indicate adaptation to cellular functions in 270 which slower ESCRT - III assembly is required . Alternatively , we might miss cofactors in our 271 in vitro reconstitution approach which could speed up the assembly and disassembly of Vps60 - 272 based polymers . 273 274 Discussion 275 We here show that the ESCRT - III subunit Vps60 functions as the basis for a novel 276 multi - subunit ESCRT - III filament . We further propose this Vps60 - based filament to 277 potentially constitute the initiator of a second ESCRT - III polymerization sequence , alternative 278 to the Snf7 - based sequence we recently unraveled ( Fig . 6F ) 41 . In detail , we found Vps60 to 279 polymerize into ring - shaped or curled filaments on membranes , which , in analogy to the Snf7 - 280 based polymerization sequence , then recruited ESCRT - III subunits Vps2 , Vps24 , Did2 and 281 Ist1 , before subsequently undergoing Vps4 / Vta1 - mediated filament turnover . Altogether , our 282 results imply that Vps60 , by acting as a template for initiating an alternative ESCRT - III 283 filament , could functionally “replace” Snf7 in specific ESCRT - III functions which require 284 biochemical properties only Vps60 - initiated polymers provide 62 , 65 , 79 , 81 . 285 In support of this notion , a recent study of ESCRT - III in Plasmodium falciparum 286 infected red blood cells suggests that PfVps32 ( Snf7 homologue ) and PfVps60 function in two 287 parallel pathways during formation of extracellular vesicles ( EV ) 82 . In contradiction to this 288 idea , a very recent study in yeast suggests Vps60 to act downstream of Snf7 , Vps2 and Vps24 , 289 as recruitment of Vps60 to endosomal membrane was distributed in Snf7 , Vps2 and Vps24 290 knockout mutants 83 . We here , however , find Snf7 - and Vps60 - polymers to co - exist 291 independently on the same membrane in vitro . Additionally , in our assays , in coherence with 292 Banjade et al . 66 , Vps60 polymerized spontaneously upon contact with membranes with a higher 293 nucleation rate than Snf7 ( this study ) . Spontaneous nucleation of all established downstream 294 ESCRT - III subunit ( Vps2 , Vps24 , Did2 and Ist1 ) was absent in our assay . 295 In contrast to Vps2 - Vps24 62 , 68 which forms the minimal binding unit of Snf7 filaments , 296 recruitment to Vps60 polymers was mediated by Vps2 - Did2 . This observation highlights the 297 central and pivotal role of Vps2 - Did2 during ESCRT - III activity , as already found in our 298 previous study 41 . Overall , our observation of Vps2 - Vps24 - Did2 recruitment to Vps60 filament 299 is strongly supported by a very recent analysis of ESCRT - III complexes isolated from yeast 300 which reports interactions of Vps60 ( Mos10 ) with Did2 , Vps2 and Vps24 83 . Vps4 - triggered 301 filament remodeling has previously been established as one of the key factors of ESCRT - III 302 activity in cells 68 , 79 , 80 . In our study , Vps60 - based filaments were able to recruit Vps4 and 303 underwent partial disassembly . Upon addition of the Vps4 activator Vta1 , a disassembly 304 hierarchy between the various subunits was established similarly to sequential 305 depolymerization observed in Snf7 - based filament 41 , 68 . In detail , Vps24 and Vps2 were 306 depolymerized first , followed by Did2 and Ist1 . This delay in Did2 disassembly could 307 potentially be mediated by its direct interaction with Vta1 58 , 59 , 74 – 77 . Alternatively , by globally 308 stimulating Vps4 activity , Vta1 might emphasize pre - existing biases in subunit susceptibility 309 to Vps4 e . g . , their accessibility within filaments . In stark contrast to Snf7 - based polymers , 310 Vps60 polymers are not disassembled in any of the conditions we tested . In cells , Vp60 - based 311 filaments might be targeted by another MIT - domain containing AAA - ATPase besides Vps4 , 312 or our in vitro reconstitution system might lack a crucial cofactor mediating interaction between 313 Vps4 and Vps60 . 314 Overall , the step - wise subunit recruitment and sequential depolymerization of Vps60 - 315 based polymers bares clear resemblance to the Snf7 - based polymerization sequence we 316 previously described 41 , and suggest the Vps60 - based filament described in this study might 317 form the initiation of an alternative Vps60 - based ESCRT - III polymerization sequence ( Fig . 6 318 F ) . Bioinformatic analysis of ESCRT - III proteins classes the subunits into two groups 319 according to their domain conservation : the Snf7 family , Vps20 , Snf7 and Vps60 , groups 320 clearly the nucleators and initiators of ESCRT - III ( class I ) , and the Vps2 family encompassing 321 Vps2 , Vps24 and Did2 ( class II ) , groups the " pivots " which recruit Vps4 57 . At a closer look , 322 both Vps60 - based and Snf7 - based ESCRT - III polymers and their corresponding presumed 323 polymerization sequences share remarkable similarities regarding their organization , indicating 324 that ESCRT - III - mediated membrane remodeling might follow a general mechanism ( Fig . 6F ) . 325 An initial class I polymer ( ring or spiral ) mediates binding of class II subunits ( helices ) which 326 then recruit an ATPase to trigger filament remodeling to promote ESCRT - III activity . In fact , 327 this generalized progression of events is supported by the observation that direct recruitment 328 of Vps4 via an initiating class I protein is non - functional in vivo 66 , potentially due to premature 329 disassembly of the ESCRT - III polymer 66 or a lack of filament remodeling capacity 55 . 330 A remaining , yet essential question about the Vps60 - based dynamic ESCRT - III 331 polymers is their cellular function . Overall , the specific differences such as structure and 332 kinetics between both ESCRT - III polymers and their associated sequences hint towards 333 functional specialization of the filaments , adopting requirements of distinct cellular functions . 334 This notion , is supported by a unique cellular localization of GFP - tagged Vps60 in vivo to not 335 only the endosomal , as it is observed for Snf7 , but also yeast’s vacuolar membrane 66 , 83 . 336 Separated functional pathways were also suggested for ESCRT - III subunits PfVps32 ( Snf7 337 homolog ) and PfVps60 during EV - formation in Plasmodium falciparum infected red blood 338 cells 82 . Finally , the author attributed the formation of smaller vesicles to the Vps60 - dependent 339 pathway which would agree with the smaller filament structures we observed . 340 341 342 Acknowledgements 343 A .

Bacteria were lysed ( 1 % triton , 20 mM Hepes pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , cOmplete ) using sonication and soluble lysate was loaded on GST - resin ( washing buffer : 20 mM Hepes , pH 8 . 0 , 150 NaCl ) , before on - column cleavage using TEV - protease was performed . Vta1 - GST was eluted prior to TEV treatment as on - column digest was inefficient ( elution buffer : 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM glutathione , 20 mM Hepes pH 8 . 0 ) . TEV protease was removed using Ni - NTA resin and the purified protein of interest was dialyzed against storage buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 8 . 0 ) before concentration . Increase of Vps4 ATPase - activity upon addition of Vta1 , was checked by malachite green assay at the end of each purification to confirm the proper functioning of Vta1 . In short , a malachite green stock solution was prepared by mixing 3 parts of 0 . 045 % malachite green in water with 2 parts of 4 . 2 % Ammonium Molybdate in 4 M HCl for 1 hour under constant stirring before supplementation with 0 . 01 % Tween20 . For quantification a calorimetric measurement at 620nm was performed 5min after mixing of 3 parts malachite green stock solution with 1 part of reaction solution either resulting from incubation of Vps4 and Vta1in reaction buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , 150 mM NaCl , 2mM MgCl2 pH = 7 . 5 ) supplemented with 1mM ATP or a phosphate calibration curve . Following the labelling procedure given by the reagent provider , Snf7 , Vps2 , Ist1 and Vps24 were labeled with TFP - AlexaFluor - 488 ( Ref N°A - 30005 , ThermoFisher Scientific , ) . Vps2 and Vps60 were labeled with TFP - Atto - 565 ( Atto - Tec AD 565 - 3 ) . Did2 was labeled with maleimide - AlexFluor - 488 ( ThermoFisher Scientific , A - 30005 ) . Vps2 was labeled with NHS - Atto - 647N ( Atto - Tec AD 647N ) . If not otherwise mentioned , following protein concentration were used : ESCRT - II 1 µ M , Vps20 1 µ M , Bro1 500nM , Vps60 50nM , Snf7 400nM , Vps2 1 µ M , Vps24 1 µ M , Did2 1 µ M , Ist1 1 µ M , Vps4 1 µ M , Vta1 500nM ATP 2 mM . In general , labeled proteins were mixed 1 : 1 with unlabeled protein . Preparation of giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUV ) and large giant unilamellar vesicles ( LUV ) GUVs were prepared by electroformation : 20 - 30 µ L of a 2mg / ml lipid solution in chloroform ( DOPC : DOPS : DOPE - Atto647N : DSPE - PEG ( 2000 ) Biotin , 6 : 4 : 0 . 01 : 0 . 003 ; Avanti Polar Lipids , Atto - tec ) were dried on indium - tin oxide ( ITO ) - coated glass slides for 1h . For experiments including Atto647N - Vps2 unlabeled GUVs were used . A growth chamber was assembled by clamping a rubber ring between the ITO - slides , filled with 500 µ l of a sucrose buffer osmotically equilibrated with the experimental buffer . ITO - Slides were then connected to an AC generator set under 1V AC ( 10 Hz ) for 1 . 5h . GUVs were stored at 4°C for at maximum a week . For LUV preparation , DOPC : DOPS ( 6 : 4 ; 10 mg / ml ) mixture was evaporated in a glass tube , 500 µ l of buffer were added , the tube was vortex followed by 5 times freezing and thawing . LUVs were stored at - 20 °C and extruded with a 200 nm filter before usage . Supported membrane bilayer assay Supported membrane bilayer assay was performed as described in 46 . Experiments were performed in 20 mM Tris pH . 6 . 8 , 200 mM NaCl and 1mM MgCl 2 . 2 mM DTT was added to the buffer for experiments including Ist1 . GUVs diluted in buffer were burst on a plasma - cleaned coverslip forming the bottom of a flow chamber ( coverslip and sticky - Slide VI 0 . 4 , Ibidi ) to form supported bilayers . Thereafter , the chamber was passivated with Casein ( 1mg / ml Sigma - Aldrich ) for 10 min and washed with buffer , before the experiments was conducted . Subsequent changes of protein or buffer solutions in the chamber were made via a syringe pump connected to the flow chamber . Briefly , protein preparations are diluted in reaction buffer with 80 µ L final volume . In presence of Ist and Did2 , 0 . 8 µ L DTT 1 mM is added . And reaction buffer has 2 mM MgCl 2 added . All proteins have a final concentration of 1 µ M during acquisitions except Vps60 and Snf7 . Snf7 patches are pre - grown at 400 nM until , then Snf7 is washed out before other protein is added . Vps60 was tested with many concentrations for dynamics assays and added at 50 nM for 9 minutes when pre - grown for experiments . Partially adhered vesicles were prepared as described in 46 . Briefly , a flow chamber assembled from a coverslip and sticky - Slide VI 0 . 4 , Ibidi was incubated with Avidin ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ) for 10 min , before washing with buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH . 6 . 8 , 200 mM NaCl and 1mM MgCl 2 ) and addition of GUVs ( including 0 . 03 % DSPE - PEG ( 2000 ) Biotin ) diluted in buffer . As soon as GUVs started to attach biotinylated - Albumin ( 1mg / ml , Sigma - Aldrich ) was added to stop attachment and prevent bursting of the GUVs . Image acquisition Confocal Imaging was performed on an inverted spinning disc microscope assembled by 3i ( Intelligent Imaging Innovation ) consisting of a Nikon base ( Eclipse C1 , Nikon ) , a 100x 1 . 49 NA oil immersion objective and an EVOLVE EM - CCD camera ( Ropper Scientific Inc . ) . For analysis of supported bilayer experiments , 3 µ m thick Z - stack were maximally projected using a Fiji plugin 84 . X - y drift of the microscopy was corrected using the plugin Turboreg and a custom - written ImageJ macro . For artificial membrane neck experiments , 15 µ m thick Z - stacks were acquired . Electron microscopy For EM experiments , LUVs were diluted 1 : 100 in buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH . 6 . 8 , 200 mM NaCl and 1mM MgCl 2 ) , spun down ( 10’ , 5 , 000g ) , resuspended in 250 nM Vps60 for 1h at 4°C . Samples were absorbed onto Carbon - coated grids Cu 300 and stained with 2 % uranyl acetate for 30s . Images were acquired on a Tecnai G2 Sphera ( FEI ) electron microscope . Optical tweezer tube pulling experiment Membrane nanotube pulling experiments were performed on the setup published in 46 allowing simultaneous optical tweezer application , spinning disc confocal and brightfield imaging based on an inverted Nikon eclipse Ti microscope and a 5W 1064nm laser focused through a 100 x 1 . 3 NA oil objective ( ML5 - CW - P - TKS - OTS , Manlight ) . Membrane nanotubes were pulled with streptavidin beads ( 3 . 05 µ m , Spherotec ) from a GUV containing 0 . 01 % DSPE - PEG ( 2000 ) Biotin and aspired in a motorized micropipette ( MP - 285 , Sutter Instrument ) . Proteins were injected using a slightly bigger micropipette connected to a pressure control system ( MFCS - VAC - 69 mbar , Fluigent ) . Quantification and statistical analysis For quantification of supported bilayer experiments , integrated fluorescence intensity of membrane patches ( Vps60 ) of single proteins patches ( Snf7 ) was measured using Fiji , background at time 0 min subtracted , normalized to time point 0 and a kymograph was extracted for dynamic experiments . Fluorescence intensities were normalized by their maximum value . To determine the colocalization of Atto565 - Vps60 and Alexa488 - Snf7 or Atto647 - Vps2 and Atto565 - Vps60 or Alexa488 - Snf7 , relative fluorescence was measured along linearized membrane contours , relative fluorescence values were binarized ( 1 above threshold , 0 below , thresholds : 0 . 3 Snf7 , 0 . 4 DOPE ) . The percentage of no colocalization was extracted by the proportion of pixels with the value 1 from the Snf7 channel for which the value in the membrane channel was 0 . No colocalization was only counted at a minimal distance of four pixels to the nearest membrane neck ( value 1 ) . For quantification of nucleation rates , membrane areas were isolated from images and Vps60 - puncta or total fluorescence of Vps60 after background subtraction ( t = 0min ) was extracted and dived through total membrane area . For all experiments the mean and standard deviation ( SD ) were calculated . Number of independent experiments ( n ) und number of patches or membrane necks ( ROI ) analyzed are indicated in the corresponding figure legends . The graph and statistics were done using Prism 8 ( GraphPad software ) . 360 361 References 362 1 . Spang , A . et al . Complex archaea that bridge the gap between prokaryotes and 363 eukaryotes .
