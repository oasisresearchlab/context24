M icrobial cells are surrounded by thick , mechanically strong cell walls which serve several key functions , such as resisting the internal tur - gor pressure of the cell , determining the shape of the organism , acting as a molecu - lar sieve , protecting the cytoplasm from po - tentially harmful compounds in the outer environment , and harboring proteins for molecular recognition and cell adhesion . 1 (cid:1) 3 In yeast , cell walls are made of a microﬁbril - lar array of (cid:2) - 1 (cid:1) 3 glucan and (cid:2) - 1 (cid:1) 6 glu - can chains , overlaid by mannoproteins , im - plying they are much stronger and stiffer than the glycocalyx of mammalian cells . 4 (cid:1) 6 Yeast cell wall mannoproteins are highly glycosylated polypeptides ( 50 (cid:1) 95 % carbo - hydrate by weight ) , thus building up a pro - teoglycan layer . 6 Frequently , these struc - tures are the target of speciﬁc antibiotics such as echinocandins , a group of glucan synthase inhibitors . 7 Moreover , the polysac - charide components interact with drugs such as Calcoﬂuor white or Congo red , which trigger the cell wall integrity ( CWI ) signaling cascade and elicit cell wall synthe - sis and remodeling . 8 , 9 A deeper under - standing of the functions of microbial cell walls requires a detailed knowledge of their morphological and structural features . Among these , cell wall thickness is a key pa - rameter to monitor since it is modulated in response to environmental stimuli or drugs . For instance , in the milk yeast Kluyveromy - ces lactis , cell wall thickness varies in depen - dence of the carbon source used for growth . 10 Moreover , fungi from hypersa - line environments are known to adapt to the high salinity by signiﬁcantly increasing their cell wall thickness . 11 Likewise , the basi - domycetes human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans produces a secondary cell wall upon acidiﬁcation of the medium . 12 In con - trast , treatment of the human ascomycetes pathogen Candida albicans with different antifungal drugs has been shown to reduce cell wall thickness . 13 , 14 In fact , resistance of this pathogen to the antifungal drug Caspo - fungin , a glucan synthase inhibitor of the echinocandin family , is correlated to cell wall thickness . 15 In the nonpathogenic eu - karyotic model yeast Saccharomyces cerevi - siae , cell wall thickness varies dramatically depending on the metabolic conditions . For instance , oxidative stress caused by the ad - dition of diamide leads to a strengthening of the cell wall . 16 How exactly the yeast cell wall thick - ness is adjusted to external agents or muta - tions is still poorly understood , owing to the lack of suitable detection techniques in live cells . Apart from biochemical and bio - physical determinations of cell wall compo - sitions in ascomycete yeasts , thin - section transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) is currently the only method available to de - termine cell wall thickness . 10 , 17 , 18 This ap - proach is demanding and requires ﬁxation * Address correspondence to heinisch @ biologie . uni - osnabrueck . de , yves . dufrene @ uclouvain . be .

Here , we present a method integrating single - molecule atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and protein design to measure cell wall thickness in a living yeast cell . The basic idea relies on the expression of His - tagged membrane sensors of increasing lengths in yeast and their subsequent speciﬁc detection at the cell surface using a modiﬁed AFM tip . After establishing the method on a wild - type strain , we demonstrate its potential by measuring changes in cell wall thickness within a few nanometers range , which result from ( bio ) chemical treatments or from mutations affecting the cell wall structure . The single molecular ruler method presented here not only avoids cell ﬁxation artifacts but also provides new opportunities for studying the dynamics of microbial cell walls during growth , drug action , or enzymatic modiﬁcation .

Here , we present a new method for measuring cell wall thickness in living S . cerevisiae cells , which integrates genetic manipulations and protein design with single - molecule atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Our general strategy is based on the generation of a series of molecular rulers , that is , His - tagged and modiﬁed Wsc1 membrane sensors of various lengths , and their subsequent single - molecule detection using chemically modiﬁed AFM tips ( Figure 1 ) . The native Wsc1 sensor in yeast is located at the upper end of the CWI signaling pathway . 19 It is composed of a relatively short cytoplasmic tail , a single predicted transmem - brane domain ( TMD ) , a large external serine / threonine - rich region ( STR ) , a cysteine - rich domain ( CRD ) , presum - ably anchoring the sensor in the cell wall and necessary for clustering , and an amino terminal signal sequence for secretion . 20 , 21 Wsc1 is a peculiar protein in that it has a rod - like structure owing to its highly glycosylated STR region 22 and was recently shown to behave as a stiff nanospring . 23 , 24 Native Wsc1 sensors cannot reach the outermost cell surface since they extend a theoreti - cal maximum of 80 nm above the plasma membrane , while the cell wall is thicker ( approximately 105 nm for glucose - grown cells ) . 10 We therefore reasoned that the use of His - tagged elongated Wsc1 derivatives with a stepwise lengthening of a chimeric outer STR region from another sensor ( Mid2 ) should force them to span the whole cell wall and reach the cell surface . Thus , they would be readily accessible to AFM tips terminated with Ni 2 (cid:3) - nitrilotriacetate ( NTA ) groups . 23 , 24 With this in mind , we designed a series of different sensors with a calculated extracellular length increasing from 90 to 154 nm ( Table 1 ) . These sensor length values are ob - tained by assuming a fully linear peptide chain and a length of a peptide bond of 0 . 36 nm . We expect that the shortest sensor to be detected under different growth conditions will provide an estimate of the cell wall thickness . First , we established the technique on wild - type S . cerevisiae cells expressing Wsc1 sensors of increasing lengths ( Figure 2 and Supporting Information Figure 1 ) . For all strains , high - resolution images revealed a smooth and homogeneous surface ( ) , consistent with earlier observations . 23 Spatially resolved force curves ( 1024 curves on 1 (cid:4) m (cid:5) 1 (cid:4) m areas ) were recorded across the cell surface using a Ni 2 (cid:3) - NTA tip to detect single sensors . Strains with long sensors ( (cid:1) 117 nm ) showed a substantial fraction of curves with speciﬁc ad - hesion events reﬂecting the detection of single sen - sors ( Supporting Information Figure 1 ) . As we previ - ously showed , such speciﬁc curves show a ﬁrst regime corresponding to the straightening of the extracellular polypeptide chain at very low force , followed by a lin - ear region where force is directly proportional to exten - sion , thus characteristic of a Hookean spring . 23 Nonlin - ear peaks were due to nonspeciﬁc adhesion to other Figure 1 . Use of molecular rulers to measure cell wall thickness . His - tagged and modiﬁed Wsc1 membrane sensors of vari - ous lengths were detected using AFM tips functionalized with Ni 2 (cid:1) - NTA groups . Only the sensors that were long enough to reach the surface were detected by the tip . The drawing below shows a modiﬁed Wsc1 sensor , with the cytoplasmic tail ( CT ) , the transmembrane domain ( TMD ) , the cysteine - rich domain ( CRD ) , the serine / threonine - rich regions ( STR ) of variable length , and the terminal His - tag ( in green ) ; cw (cid:2) cell wall , pm (cid:2) plasma membrane .

The adhesion force histograms obtained from a to - tal of 4096 curves ( Figure 2 ) indicated that strains fea - turing sensors shorter than 112 nm showed essentially no speciﬁc adhesion events ( only 0 . 3 % of the force curves ) , thus no sensor detection . By contrast , strains with sensors with a length of at least 117 nm always showed a substantial fraction of speciﬁc adhesion events with a mean magnitude of 150 (cid:1) 175 and 300 (cid:1) 325 pN that we attribute primarily to monova - lent and multivalent interactions between a single His 8 moiety with one and two NTA groups , respectively . However , we cannot exclude that some of the 300 (cid:1) 325 pN forces also reﬂect the detection of two distinct His - tagged sensors . The sensogram obtained by plotting the variation of the amount of detected sensors as a function of sen - sor length showed a sharp increase around 115 nm ( Fig - ure 3a ) . The sensogram clearly shows that shorter sen - sors ( (cid:6) 110 nm ) were never detected , indicating that they do not reach the surface , while longer ones ( (cid:7) 120 nm ) were detected with a rather constant value of 80 sensors / (cid:4) m . From the derivative of this curve , we esti - mate the cell wall thickness to be 115 nm . This is ap - proximately 10 % higher than the 105 nm mean value determined with TEM . 10 This discrepancy between AFM and TEM measurements may have two origins . First , our calculated sensor lengths are based on the assump - tion of a linear peptide ( 273 amino acids in length for the extracellular part of the shortest sensor ) and a length of a peptide bond of 0 . 36 nm , while proteins are usually not linear , but folded into complex tertiary structures . The nanospring behavior conferred by the STR region suggests that this region , which constitutes most of the extracellular part of the Wsc1 sensor , is in - deed fairly linear and comes close to the calculated length . 23 However , the N - terminal CRD domain consti - tuted by approximately 80 amino acids is expected to be folded and could account for the 10 nm difference . Second , the thinner cell wall measured by TEM could be an artifact caused by the invasive sample preparation procedure ( e . g . , dehydration ) . By contrast , our AFM ex - periments enable one to directly probe wall thickness in native live cells . We estimate the precision of our method to be on the order of 5 nm based on the highly contrasted shape of the sensograms . This precision may still be improved by increasing the number of data points in each sensogram ( i . e . , by increasing the num - ber of wild - type and mutant strains carrying molecular rulers with further lengths variations , which is very de - manding ) and by decreasing the errors for each data point ( thus increasing the number of force measure - ments , which is very challenging with the current tech - nology ) . In the future , we expect that parallel and auto - mated force measurements may help improve the throughput and precision of the method . Having established the method on wild - type cells , we next analyzed whether the sensograms are sensi - tive to changes in cell wall thickness resulting from mu - TABLE 1 .

The native Wsc1 sensor is delivered to the plasma mem - brane by the classical secretion pathway and subse - quently displays a high rate of internalization . 25 The lat - ter is mediated by an endocytosis signal located within the cytoplasmic tail of the sensor , and mutation of this signal results in the construction of a much thicker cell wall . 26 If endocytosis of the sensor is inhibited , its con - centration at the plasma membrane increases , presum - ably leading to a permanent signal generation , which in turn will trigger a more pronounced cell wall synthe - sis as compared to the wild - type . The biological impor - tance of this process has recently been substantiated by the lower ﬁtness of such Wsc1 endocytosis mutants in growth competition experiments with wild - type cells . 27 We therefore ﬁrst investigated a strain carrying such mutant versions within the Wsc1 sensor ruler set ( Wsc1 NPF / AAI ) . Similar to the strategy described above for the wild - type , the series of mutant sensors with in - creasing lengths was expressed from single - copy inte - grants at the LEU2 locus in a wsc1 deletion background and probed by AFM . As evident from Figure 3a , the Wsc1 NPF / AAI mutation led to a dramatic change of the sensogram . Of all the sensors , only the two longest ones O with extracellular length of 142 and 154 nm O could be detected at the cell surface . This pro - vides direct evidence that the mutant cell wall is much thicker , with an average in vivo thickness of approxi - mately 140 nm . This is in good agreement with the hy - pothesis that the need for new cell wall biosynthesis is signaled through the Wsc1 sensor to the downstream CWI pathway components . 26 We then explored whether the method can detect changes in cell wall thickness resulting from treatment Figure 2 .

Diamide is known to cause oxidative stress , which results in the strength - ening of the yeast cell wall . 16 On the other hand , Zymol - yase is an enzyme mixture with high glucanase activ - ity , which degrades cell wall polysaccharides ( note that cell wall digesting enzymes have been extensively em - ployed for the generation of spheroplasts , ever since the dawn of yeast molecular biology ) . 28 , 29 It is thus ex - pected to rapidly produce thinner cell walls upon addi - tion to yeast cells . As illustrated in Figure 4a , sensors with a length of 112 nm could still be detected in large amount on Zymolyase - treated cells , thus reﬂecting their thinner cell wall . Zymolyase - treated cells with short sensors ( (cid:6) 112 nm ) showed a very low number of sensors detected per (cid:4) m 2 , indicating that the enzy - matic digestion essentially affected a 10 nm thick outer layer . Presumably , this moderate effect is due to the short incubation period with the enzyme mixture . Longer incubations will likely result in the production of too much debris interfering with the AFM tip , so that this cannot be tested due to experimental constraints . Nevertheless , we note that Zymolyase - treated cells with short sensors ( (cid:6) 112 nm ) showed a moderate sensor de - tectability ( 10 sensors / (cid:4) m ) , an effect that we attribute to their heterogeneous cell wall structure . Consistent with this , AFM topographic images suggested that treated cells were rougher than native ones ( Figure 4a ) . In contrast to these results , even the longer sensors ( up to 154 nm ) could hardly be detected at the surface of diamide - treated cells , documenting thickening of the cell wall by more than 40 nm ( Figure 4b ) . This agrees with images obtained from electron microscopy for cells grown under such conditions . 16 That the number of sensors at the surface of diamide - treated cells was strongly reduced ( from (cid:8) 80 to (cid:8) 10 sensors / (cid:4) m ) but not completely abolished may be due to either a gen - eral heterogeneity in cell wall thickness caused by the Figure 3 .

Supporting the former hypothesis , we found that the surface of treated cells was generally rougher than the one of un - treated controls ( Figure 4b ) . CONCLUSION Our experiments demonstrate that the use of His - tagged membrane sensors as molecular rulers com - bined with their detection by single - molecule AFM is a powerful platform for measuring cell wall thick - ness in live cells . The obtained sensograms are shown to be a valuable tool to detect thickness changes resulting from enzyme or drug treatment and are therefore expected to trigger a large num - ber of investigations of biological and medical rel - evance . Obviously , other yeast surface sensors ( e . g . , from the cell wall integrity or the high osmolarity signaling pathways ) of S . cerevisiae and their rela - tives from other fungi are good candidates for fu - ture studies , with possible impacts on antifungal drug development . 7 Moreover , the study of mamma - lian sensors such as polycystin , which is related to hereditary polycystic kidney disease and shows some striking similarities to the Wsc1 sensor , could be of interest . 20 Compared to ﬂuorescence methods traditionally used in cell wall research , our AFM ap - proach is much more sensitive ( single - molecule de - tection ) and surface speciﬁc ( no signal from the un - derlying layers ) . In fact , ﬂuorescence microscopy showed that even the shortest His - tagged sensor constructs can be detected by using speciﬁc anti - bodies , indicating at least a partial permeability of the cell wall for the latter ( unpublished results ) , which excludes this strategy for the determination of in vivo cell wall thickness . METHODS Media , GrowthConditions , Strains , andGeneticManipulations . Media and standard procedures were applied as described . 30 The S . cer - evisiae strains used in this work were exclusively derived from HOD48 - 1D ( MATa wsc1 : : KlURA3 ura3 - 52 leu2 - 3 , 112 his3 - 11 , 15 ) , which except for the mating type and the wsc1 deletion is isogenic to the previously described strain HD56 - 5A . 31 All WSC1 variants were subcloned into the vector YIplac128 and inte - grated at the LEU2 locus of HOD48 - 1D by the one - step gene re - placement method , selecting for leucine prototrophy . 32 , 33 Yeast transformation was performed by the freeze method . 34 Homolo - gous recombination was triggered by digestion with BstEII prior to yeast transformation , and single - copy integration was con - ﬁrmed by PCR using the oligonucleotide pair 06 . 3 / 06 . 4 ( 5 = - GGCCGAGCGGTCTAAGGCGC - 3 = and 5 = - GTGGTGCCCTCCTCCTTGTC - 3 = ) ﬂanking the LEU2 locus , in con - junction with the long - range high ﬁdelity Taq polymerase kit from Fermentas . The WSC1 NPF / AAI allele , carrying the mutated en - docytosis signal at positions 344 (cid:1) 346 in the deduced amino acid sequence , was obtained by in vitro mutagenesis as de - scribed elsewhere and introduced by several subcloning steps into YIplac128 prior to integration of the constructs at the LEU2 locus ( cloning details and plasmid sequences are available upon request ) . 27 In order to create the sensor ruler set , plasmid pJJH1147 was constructed . It contains the Bam HI / Hin dIII frag - ment encoding the chimeric 8xHis - Mid2 - Wsc1 sensor from pBH01 subcloned into the respective sites of pUK1921 ; 23 , 35 pJJH1147 was then used as a template for inverse PCR reac - tions , with the oligonucleotide 09 . 323 ( 5 = - AGAACTCGAGCTACTTACGGAAGAACGTGC - 3 = , which reads to - ward the 5 = - end of the sensor construct starting from down - stream of the 8xHis - tag coding sequence ) , in combination each with one of the oligonucleotides 09 . 324 (cid:1) 09 . 329 and 10 . 65 (cid:1) 10 . 67 to consecutively shorten the protein coding se - quence , as listed in Table 1 . All oligonucleotides contained an in - frame XhoI recognition sequence at their 5 = - end , which allowed for digestion of the PCR products and their circularization by T4 - DNA ligase . After ampliﬁcation in E . coli , the resulting clones were sequenced to eliminate candidates with grave PCR errors within the sensor coding sequence and subcloned into YI - plac128 . For AFM studies , transformants were cultured in leucine - free synthetic media as follows . Two or three colonies from the solid medium plate used as inoculum were transferred into cul - ture medium . Cells were agitated overnight at 30 °C , grown up to the late logarithmic phase , and harvested by centrifugation . They were washed three times with sodium acetate buffer and resuspended in 10 mL buffer to a concentration of (cid:8) 10 6 cells / mL . For some experiments , cells were pretreated with diamide ( Sigma ) . To this end , 500 (cid:4) L of a 10 mM diamide solution was added into leucine - free synthetic media . For Zymolyase experi - ments , 50 (cid:4) L of a Zymolyase solution ( Sigma , 0 . 3 mg / mL , sup - plied as “Lyticase” from Athrobacter luteus ) was injected into the AFM liquid cell . Atomic Force Microscopy . AFM measurements were performed in buffered solutions ( sodium acetate (cid:3) 0 . 1 M sucrose , pH 4 . 75 ) using a Nanoscope IV Multimode AFM ( Veeco Metrology Group ) . Sharpened silicon nitride cantilevers ( MSCT , Veeco ) and gold - coated cantilevers ( OMCL - TR4 , Olympus Ltd . , Tokyo , Japan ) were used for imaging and force measurements , respectively . Gold - coated cantilevers were cleaned for 15 min by UV and ozone treatment , rinsed with ethanol , dried with a gentle nitrogen ﬂow , immersed overnight in ethanol containing 0 . 01 mM of NTA - terminated alkanethiols ( ProChimia , Poland ) , rinsed with etha - nol , further immersed in a 40 mM aqueous solution of NiSO 4 ( pH 7 . 2 ) for 1 h , and then ﬁnally rinsed with buffer . Cells were immo - bilized by mechanical trapping into porous polycarbonate mem - branes with 3 (cid:4) m pore size ( Millipore ) . The pore diameter was modiﬁed to match the cell diameter by etching overnight in 10 mL of 5 M NaOH ( Sigma ) at room temperature . 36 Membranes were then rinsed several times in Milli - Q water . After ﬁltering a concentrated cell suspension , the ﬁlter was gently rinsed with buffer , carefully cut ( 1 cm (cid:5) 1 cm ) and attached to a steel sample puck ( Veeco Metrology Group ) using a small piece of double - face adhesive tape , and the mounted sample was transferred into the AFM liquid cell while avoiding dewetting . We ﬁrst im - aged the topography of single yeast cells by engaging a silicon nitride tip and scanning the sample in contact mode . To detect His - tagged sensors by force spectroscopy , the tip was changed with a Ni 2 (cid:3) - NTA - gold tip and then re - engaged on the cell of in - terest . The spring constants of the Ni 2 (cid:3) - NTA - gold cantilevers were measured using the thermal noise method ( Picoforce , Veeco Metrology Group ) , yielding values ranging from 0 . 02 to 0 . 028 N / m . Unless otherwise speciﬁed , all force measurements were performed using a constant approach and retraction speed of 1500 nm / s , and with an interaction time of 500 ms . Acknowledgment .
