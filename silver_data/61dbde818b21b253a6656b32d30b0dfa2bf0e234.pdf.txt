Background An outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia is ongoing , called 2019 - nCoV , was first identified in Wuhan , Hubei province , China at the end of 2019 [ 1 , 2 ] . As of Febru - ary 10th , 2020 , at least 40 , 261 cases confirmed , 23 , 589 cases suspected , 909 cases death and 3444 cases were cured in China ( Fig . 1 ) [ 3 ] . 24 countries ( Fig . 2 ) such as Japan , Singapore , Thailand , Korea , and the United States have 383 cases being diagnosed , with 1 case death so far [ 3 ] . Although Chinese authorities improved surveillance network , made the laboratory be able to recognize the outbreak within a few weeks and announced the virus genome that provide efficient epidemiological control , World Health Organization ( WHO ) assessed the risk as ‘very high’ in China and ‘high’ in global level in the com - ing weeks [ 4 ] , and declared the public health emergency of international concern ( PHEIC ) over the global out - break of 2019 - nCoV in January 31 , 2020 . Based on the current epidemiological survey and data , more comprehensive information is required to under - stand 2019 - nCoV feature , epidemiology of the outbreak including the source , transmission , extent of infection , and the clinical picture . Further strategies are required to determine according to the current status . Epidemiology 2019‑nCoV features Coronaviruses are enveloped , positive - sense , sin - gle stranded RNA viruses that are distributed broadly among humans , other mammals , and birds , which cause respiratory , enteric , hepatic , and neurologic dis - eases [ 5 ] . Six coronavirus species are known to cause human disease . Four viruses including hCoV - 229E , OC43 , NL63 , and HKU1 are prevalent and typically cause mild respiratory diseases [ 6 ] . The two novel fatal coronaviruses emerge periodically in different Open Access * Correspondence : song . yuanlin @ zs - hospital . sh . cn Department of Pulmonary Medicine , Zhongshan Hospital , Fudan University , 180 Feng Lin Road , Shanghai 200032 , China Page 2 of 7 She et al . Clin Trans Med ( 2020 ) 9 : 19 areas , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syn - drome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) in 2012 . Given the high prevalence and wide distribution of coronaviruses , the genetic diversity and frequent recombination of genomes , and increasing human and animal activities , novel coronaviruses are likely to emerge periodically in humans owing to frequent cross - species infections and occasional spillover events [ 7 , 8 ] . As Zhu et al . reported that the identified 2019 - nCoV genome has been sequenced are phylogenetically the closest to certain beta - coronaviruses detected in bats , belonging to the sarbecovirus subgenus of coronaviri - dae family [ 1 ] , and these results in conjunction with Fig . 1 a The number cases of 2019 - nCoV pneumonia confirmed in China by province Feb 10th , 2020 ; b The number cases of 2019 - nCoV pneumonia confirmed in Hubei province , China Feb 10th , 2020 Page 3 of 7 She et al . Clin Trans Med ( 2020 ) 9 : 19 other reports show that it is 75 – 80 % identical to the SARS - CoV [ 9 , 10 ] and 40 % identical to the MERS - CoV . It can be propagated in the same cells for growing SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV . Notably , 2019 - nCoV grows better in primary human airway epithelial cells than in standard tissue - culture cells , unlike SARS - CoV or MERS - CoV . It appears that 2019 - nCoV uses the same cellular receptor hACE2 ( human angiotensin - convert - ing enzyme 2 ) as SARS - CoV [ 11 ] , it seems the trans - mission may develop after signs of lower respiratory tract disease . Origin The origin , spread and virulence of 2019 - nCoV remain largely unknown . Most of early infected patients were linked to Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan , China . However , there were 13 of the 41 cases had no link to the marketplace [ 2 ] . Most importantly , in the earliest case , the patient became ill on the 1st December 2019 and had no reported access to the sea - food market . And no epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases . It seems that the seafood market is not the only origin of the virus . The virus probably came into the market place first then it went out of there [ 12 ] . Analyses of blood sam - ples in China from people and animals from other ani - mal markets may reveal a clear picture of where the 2019 - nCoV originated . Spreading An increasing number of cases evidenced the 2019 - nCoV have the ability to transmit among humans [ 13 , 14 ] . To date , no research found the special suscepti - ble population of the new virus seems like SARS [ 15 ] , 2019 - nCoV is easily transmissible in human generally , but disease severity is not correlated to transmission efficiency [ 16 ] . According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( China CDC ) reported that laboratory tests ruled out SARS - CoV , MERS - CoV , influenza , avian influenza , adenovirus and other com - mon respiratory pathogens . CDC considered the 2019 - nCoV as a possible pathogen causing the outbreak [ 16 ] . The 2019 - nCoV can cause severe illness in old patients with comorbidities and transmit readily among people [ 17 ] . At present , the mortality of 2019 - nCoV in China is 2 . 3 % [ 3 ] , compared with 9 . 6 % of SARS and 34 . 4 % of MERS reported by WHO [ 16 , 18 ] . Based on the cur - rent data , the new virus is not as fatally as many people thought . The climate of temperature , relative humidity , and wind velocity should also be attention to the transmis - sion . 2019 - nCoV pneumonia emerging attacks in the cold seasonal nature akin to viruses such as SARS and influenza [ 19 ] . Fig . 2 The number of 2019 - nCoV pneumonia confirmed in the world 10 Feb 2020 Page 4 of 7 She et al . Clin Trans Med ( 2020 ) 9 : 19 Clinical features Based on the current epidemiological survey , most individuals had a history of close contact to a patient who had 2019 - nCoV infection or a history of travel from Wuhan City or Hubei province , China . The incu - bation period is generally 3 – 7 days ( within 14 days ) [ 20 ] . Symptoms The symptoms of 2019 - nCoV infection were nonspe - cific . The most common symptoms were onset of fever , generalized weakness and dry cough . Some patients had headache and / or myalgia , but upper respiratory symp - toms such as runny nose were rare [ 20 ] . Diarrhea was often identified , which had been reported 10 . 6 % in SARS and up to 30 % in MERS [ 21 ] . More than half of patients developed shortness of breath , the median duration from disease onset to dyspnea was 8 days [ 2 ] . Patients infected with 2019 - nCoV might develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , followed by septic shock , refractory metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction , if the disease could not be controlled [ 20 ] . Notably , some patients were afebrile or confirmed bio - logically to have an asymptomatic infection [ 21 ] . These cryptic cases of walking pneumonia might serve as a possible source to propagate the outbreak . Further stud - ies on the epidemiological significance of these asympto - matic cases are warranted . Laboratory findings The blood cell counts of patients showed total white blood cells , lymphocyte , and platelet were lower than the average with extended activated thromboplastin time , increased C - reactive protein and muscle enzyme level . D - dimer level were higher and lymphocyte decrease pro - gressively , if the disease had aggravation . The cytokine storm such as IL1B , IL1RA , IL7 , IL8 could be associated with disease severity [ 2 , 21 ] . The multifocal ground glass changes on chest CT scan were typical of viral pneumonia [ Fig . 3 ] . If the disease continued to develop , the bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation would be found on chest CT scan [ 2 , 21 ] . The lungs of aged patients showed more diffuse and extensive imaging than those of the younger patients [ 20 ] . Microbiological testing Nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples of patients were available for testing by specific RT - PCR assays for 2019 - nCoV to detect the highly conserved RdRp and variable S gene . The cycle threshold values of the spu - tum samples were 8 – 13 cycles earlier than those of throat swabs , indicating higher viral loads detected in the lower respiratory tract . It is consistent with the observations in patients with MERS who had higher viral loads in lower respiratory tract samples than in upper respiratory tract samples [ 22 ] . Serum samples for 2019 - nCoV which might indicate some virus spillover from the more severely infected lung into the systemic circulation , as previously reported in patients with SARS [ 23 ] . However , the first case of 2019 - nCoV in the United States report the stool and res - piratory specimens from the patients tested positive by RT - PCR for 2019 - nCoV , whereas the serum remained negative [ 24 ] . Importantly , the ground glass changes on chest CT scan appeared earlier than the positive for RT - PCR test in some cases . Repeat testing of nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples are recommended in clinical suspected cases with an initially negative result . Management strategy Blocking transmission Learning from the SARS outbreak , which started as ani - mal - to - human transmission during the first phase of the epidemic , all game meat trades should be terminate to prevent this portal of transmission . At the same time , we could not ignore the environmental assessments at the Fig . 3 The multifocal ground glass changes on chest CT scan were typical of viral pneumonia in one infected 2019 - nCoV patients . a shadow in right upper lobe ; b shadow in bilateral lobe ; c shadow in left lower lobe Page 5 of 7 She et al . Clin Trans Med ( 2020 ) 9 : 19 seafood market and investigations to identify the patho - gen causing the outbreak . Person - to - person transmission was efficient and super - spreading events had led to major outbreaks in public gathering places . The severity of disease is an important indirect factor helps to identify those who had been infected . If infection does not cause serious disease or asymptomatic infection , infected people probably end up in health care centers . Instead , they would go to work and travel , thereby potentially spreading the virus to their contacts [ 16 ] . Recent epidemiological survey and studies showed the patients who did not travel to Wuhan became infected with the virus after several days of contact with the family members . None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals , neither had visited a Wuhan hospital [ 21 ] . Person - to - person trans - mission in family homes or hospital , and intercity spread of 2019 - nCoV are occurring , and therefore vigilant con - trol measures are warranted at the whole stage of the epidemic . Isolation Fortunately , with the spread of the new coronavirus accelerating , Chinese authorities responded not only treating the patients and isolating new cases as identi - fied , tracing the contact , but also extended travel restric - tions to 48 million people in hardest - hit Hubei province , banned inter - province buses to Beijing and canceled tour group travel abroad [ 25 , 26 ] . However it is not completely under control , people with symptoms of pneumonia reported travel history to Wuhan have been identified at international airports over the past week . It is crucial to isolate patients , trace and quarantine contacts as early as possible because asymptomatic infec - tion began to appear [ 21 ] . Most importantly , the extent of interhuman transmission needs to be determined . Transmission of SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV occurred to a large extent by means of superspreading events [ 27 , 28 ] . Superspreading events have been implicated in 2019 - nCoV transmission , so educate the public on both food and personal hygiene , and compliance to infection isola - tion to prevent super - spreading events deserves highly attention . Protection Transmission of 2019 - nCoV probably occurs through spreading airborne and contact . Aerosol and fecal – oral transmission remain unclear [ 24 ] . Public health meas - ures , including quarantining in the community as well as timely diagnosis and strict adherence to universal precautions in health care settings [ 29 ] , were critical in reducing the transmission of 2019 - nCoV . For healthcare personnel , to minimize the chance of exposures to 2019 - nCoV needs to follow the standard of contact and airborne precautions , personal protection including gloves , gowns , respiratory protection , eye pro - tection , and hand hygiene . Some procedures performed on 2019 - nCoV infected patients could generate infectious aerosols , e . g . , nasopharyngeal specimen collection , spu - tum induction , and open suctioning of airways should be performed cautiously . If performed , these procedures should take place in an airborne infection isolation room , and personnel should use respiratory and eye protec - tion , and hand hygiene [ 30 ] . In addition , management of environmental infection control including laundry , food service utensils , and medical waste should also be performed . Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) , alternative selec - tion to reducing infection for medical personnel , should be explored ( Joint developed by Respiratory Research Institution of Zhongshan Hospital , Fudan University and RealMax Ltd Co ) , which will be benefit for remote guid - ance of practices . Alternative medication No antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective . Previous studies showed the com - bination of lopinavir and ritonavir may be beneficial for SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV infected patients [ 31 , 32 ] . Treatment with intravenous remdesivir ( a novel nucleo - tide analogue prodrug in development ) showed signifi - cant improvement for the first case in US [ 24 ] . A trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with 2019 - nCoV infection . Recently , a potent binding of 2019 - nCoV spike protein by a SARS - CoV specific human monoclonal anti - body were under investigation [ 33 ] . As the cytokine storm was observed in severe 2019 - nCoV infection patients , low dose corticosteroids has been used to treat the patients for possible benefit by reducing inflammatory - induced lung injury . However , corticosteroids did not reduce the mortality for SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV infection by WHO interim guid - ance [ 34 , 35 ] . Treatment regiments were classified into three catego - ries depends on the severity of the disease : ( 1 ) For mild to moderate disease , the major treatment is support - ive therapy [ 21 ] ; ( 2 ) for severe disease , oxygen inhala - tion through mask , high nasal oxygen flow inhalation , or non - invasive ventilation is needed . Careful and dynamic evaluation of patients oximeter and Chest imaging as well as laboratory examination is important ; ( 3 ) for very severe disease , protective mechanical ventilation after tracheal intubation is required , and prone position venti - lation followed if P / F ratio not improved , and eventually extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) might Page 6 of 7 She et al . Clin Trans Med ( 2020 ) 9 : 19 be implemented if prone position plus mechanical venti - lation did not work . Notably , the anxiety and depression of patients need to be consideration . We should not only pay attention to disease treatment , but also the mental issues of patients . In addition , some traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) , such as Snow Lotus ( Saussuea involucrata ) , LianHua - QingWen [ 36 ] , LiuShenWan [ 37 ] might be beneficial for coronavirus infection treatment through immunity enhancement . Further evidence is needed to assess the effect of TCM treatment for patients infected with 2019 - nCoV . Conclusions 2019 - nCoV pneumonia are emerging attack at China and worldwide in the winter of 2019 - 2020 . The identi - fied 2019 - nCoV genome has been sequenced the closest to some beta - coronaviruses detected in bats . Person - to - person transmission in family homes or hospital , and intercity spread of 2019 - nCoV are occurring . At pre - sent , the mortality of 2019 - nCoV in China is 2 . 3 % , com - pared with 9 . 6 % of SARS and 34 . 4 % of MERS reported by WHO . It seems the new virus is not as fatally as many people thought . The most common symptoms were onset of fever , generalized weakness and dry cough . Notably , some patients were afebrile or confirmed bio - logically to have an asymptomatic infection . And the ground glass changes on chest CT scan were earlier than the positive for RT - PCR test in some cases . Repeat test - ing of nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples are rec - ommended in clinical suspected cases with an initially negative result . According to the current status , blocking transmission , isolation , respiratory and eye protection , and hand hygiene are the urgent management strategies against 2019 - nCoV .
