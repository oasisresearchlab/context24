Role of the ENTH Domain in Phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - Bisphosphate Binding and Endocytosis Toshiki Itoh , 1 Seizo Koshiba , 2 Takanori Kigawa , 2 , 3 Akira Kikuchi , 4 Shigeyuki Yokoyama , 2 , 3 , 5 Tadaomi Takenawa 1 * Endocytic proteins such as epsin , AP180 , and Hip1R ( Sla2p ) share a conserved modular region termed the epsin NH 2 - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain , which plays a crucial role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis through an unknown target . Here , we demonstrate a strong af(cid:222)nity of the ENTH domain for phos - phatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] . With nuclear magnetic res - onance analysis of the epsin ENTH domain , we determined that a cleft formed with positively charged residues contributed to phosphoinositide binding . Over - expression of a mutant , epsin Lys 76 3 Ala 76 , with an ENTH domain defective in phosphoinositide binding , blocked epidermal growth factor internalization in COS - 7 cells . Thus , interaction between the ENTH domain and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is essential for endocytosis mediated by clathrin - coated pits . ENTH domains are structural modules of ; 140 amino acids found in mammalian epsin 1 and 2 , AP180 , and Hip1R , as well as in their yeast homologs , Ent1p through Ent4p , yAP180 , and Sla2p ( 1 – 4 ) . Mammalian epsin plays a crucial role in clathrin - mediated en - docytosis ( 2 ) . Yeast Ent1p and Ent2p are essential for actin function and for endocyto - sis . Disruption of both genes in yeast is lethal , and the ENTH domain is required to inhibit lethality . Almost all temperature - sensitive al - leles of the ENT1 gene are found within the ENTH domain , supporting its importance ( 3 ) . The essential function of the conserved ENTH domain from yeast to mammal prompted us to identify its downstream tar - get . Using an ENTH affinity chromatography column , we were not able to detect any pro - tein from bovine brain extract bound to the epsin ENTH domain . Because clathrin - medi - ated endocytosis is mediated by a specific interaction between endocytic proteins and the lipid bilayer to form invaginated buds and coated vesicles ( 5 , 6 ) , and because many biochemical and physiological studies sug - gest important roles for phosphoinositides in endocytosis and vesicular trafficking ( 7 – 9 ) , we examined the possibility that the ENTH domain binds to phosphoinositides . To determine whether the ENTH domain could bind phosphoinositides , we subjected a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion pro - tein of the epsin ENTH domain to liposome binding assay . Although epsin ENTH did not co - sediment with phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) – and phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) – based liposomes , increasing concentrations of phosphatidylinositol4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ Ptd - Ins ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] in the liposomes resulted in co - sedimentation of the ENTH domain ( Fig . 1A ) . Co - sedimentation was not observed in the pres - ence of increased concentrations of PtdIns in the liposomes , demonstrating a high specificity for the interaction with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Co - sedi - mentation was clearly observed at 0 . 2 % PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and the dissociation constant K d for the interaction was estimated at 0 . 37 m M . The strong interaction between the ENTH do - main and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was confirmed by other methods , including overlay assays with protein probe against phospholipids ( Fig . 1B ) and lipid probe against the ENTH domain blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane ( Fig . 1C ) . The speci - ficity of the binding was then studied with all known mammalian phosphoinositides . PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 also showed substantial bind - ing , whereas PtdIns , PtdIns3P , PtdIns4P , PtdIns5P , PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , and PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 exhibited far lower affinities ( Fig . 1D ) . No binding was observed of other acidic phos - pholipids , such as phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine ( Fig . 1D ) . We also carried out liposome binding assays for the AP180 ENTH domain . AP180 ENTH bound to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 strongly and also showed a lower affinity for PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Fig . 1E ) . 1 Department of Biochemistry , Institute of Medical Science , University of Tokyo , 4 - 6 - 1 Shirokanedai , Mi - nato - ku , Tokyo 108 - 8639 , Japan . 2 RIKEN Genomic Sciences Center , 1 - 7 - 22 Suehiro - cho , Tsurumi - ku , Yokohama - shi , Kanagawa 230 - 0045 , Japan . 3 Cellular Signaling Laboratory , RIKEN Harima Institute at SPring - 8 , 1 - 1 - 1 Kouto , Mikazuki - cho , Sayo , Hyogo 679 - 5148 , Japan . 4 Department of Biochemistry , Hiro - shima University School of Medicine , 1 - 2 - 3 Kasumi , Minami - ku , Hiroshima 734—8551 , Japan . 5 Depart - ment of Biophysics and Biochemistry , Graduate School of Science , University of Tokyo , 7 - 3 - 1 Hongo , Bunkyo - ku , Tokyo 113 - 0033 , Japan . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

We next studied intracellular localization of the epsin ENTH domain using green flu - orescent protein ( GFP ) fusion proteins ( 10 ) . COS - 7 cells transfected with the GFP - pleck - strin homology ( PH ) domain of phospho - lipase C – d 1 ( PLC - d 1 ) showed localization at the plasma membrane ( 11 , 12 ) , whereas GFP alone showed no specific localization . Trans - fected GFP - epsin ENTH domain was also localized to the plasma membrane , even after the treatment with 300 nM wortmannin [ Web fig . 1 ( 10 ) ] , indicating an interaction with the plasma membrane , presumably via PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 but not through PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in vivo . To identify the phosphoinositide binding site of the epsin ENTH domain , we investigated the interaction of the epsin ENTH domain with inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate [ Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ] , the head group of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , using nu - clear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy . Changes in the backbone amide 1 H and 15 N chemical shifts of the epsin ENTH domain were measured as a function of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 concentration ( Fig . 2A ) . Mapping of the chang - es in the chemical shift onto the three - dimen - sional structure showed that the most perturbed residues are localized at three sites : the NH 2 - terminal unstructured region ( site 1 ) , the sol - vent - exposed surface of the first helix ( site 2 ) , and the region around loop 1 ( loop connecting helices 1 and 2 ) and loop 3 ( loop connecting helices 3 and 4 ) and helix 4 ( site 3 ) ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Calculation of the electrostatic surface potential of the epsin ENTH domain showed that sites 1 and 3 are positively charged , where - as site 2 is negatively charged ( Fig . 2C ) . In addition , highly conserved residues in ENTH domains were concentrated at site 3 ( Arg 63 , Trp 71 , Arg 72 , and Lys 76 ) ( Fig . 2D ) . To evaluate the importance of these sites , several residues were mutated , and the binding affinities for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 were studied ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) . Substitution of alanine for Arg 63 and Lys 76 almost completely abolished PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding of the epsin ENTH domain , whereas substitution for Arg 72 only slightly decreased the affinity . Substitution for Lys 86 , which is located at the end of helix 4 but is distant from site 3 , did not affect phosphoinositide binding ( Fig . 2E ) . Thus , specific residues in site 3 ap - peared to be involved in the direct binding of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Many residues in site 1 showed large chemical shift changes , suggesting a large structural change upon phosphoinositide binding ( Fig . 2A ) . Deletion of the entire site 1 region ( NH 2 - terminal , 18 residues ) resulted in a complete loss of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding ( Fig . 2F ) . Of the positively charged residues within this region , only Arg 8 was shown to be essential for binding ( Fig . 2F ) . Results sug - gest that site 1 , the NH 2 - terminal unstruc - tured region , was necessary for binding and adopted a specific conformation upon bind - ing to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The most probable binding model , based on these data , is as follows : the head moiety of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binds to the cleft composed of loop 1 , helix 3 , and helix 4 . Subsequently , the NH 2 - terminal unstructured region binds to site 2 , and Arg 8 is positioned near the binding site . The side chains of three basic residues ( Arg 8 , Arg 63 , and Lys 76 ) then form salt bridges with the phosphate groups of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 2G ) . In addition to the ENTH domain , epsin contains several motifs involved in linking clathrin - coat proteins such as AP - 2 , Eps15 , and clathrin heavy chain ( 2 , 13 ) . The interac - tions with these proteins are mediated by Asp - Pro - Trp ( DPW ) , Asn - Pro - Phe ( NPF ) , and clathrin - binding motifs present in the central to COOH - terminal region of the epsin molecule ( Fig . 3A ) . Overexpression of epsin DPW motifs results in an inhibition of clath - rin - mediated endocytosis ( 2 ) . To evaluate the importance of the interac - tion between the ENTH domain and phospho - inositide in endocytosis in vivo , we studied the effect of mutant epsin overexpression on endo - cytosis in COS - 7 cells . COS - 7 cells treated with Texas Red – conjugated epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) showed internalization within 10 min . EGF internalization was not affected by over - expression of wild - type epsin in COS - 7 cells ( Fig . 3B ) . In contrast , overexpression of epsin D ENTH in which the NH 2 - terminal ENTH do - main was deleted inhibited internalization ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . This inhibition occurred in a competitive manner in which coat proteins such as AP - 2 and Eps15 were presumably seques - tered by DPW or NPF motifs present in the COOH - terminal half of the mutant epsin mol - ecule overexpressed in the cell . EGF internal - ization was also inhibited by overexpression of epsin Lys 76 3 Ala 76 ( K76A ) ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) , in which Lys 76 of the ENTH domain was sub - stituted with an alanine residue . Overexpression of epsin Arg 72 3 Ala 72 ( R72A ) , which still binds to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 2E ) , did not show any inhibitory effect on EGF internalization ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . Thus , the phosphoinositide - binding ability of the ENTH domain was es - sential for epsin to induce clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and the lack of this ability was comparable to a loss of the entire ENTH domain . The epsin ENTH domain associates with a transcription factor , promyelocytic leuke - Fig . 1 . Speci(cid:222)c binding of the ENTH domain to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 .

In our study , ENTH R72A still bound to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 2E ) , and overexpression of epsin R72A did not inhibit EGF internalization ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) , suggesting that clathrin - mediated endocytosis does not require an interaction between the ENTH domain and PLZF . Thus , interaction between PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and the ENTH domain of epsin is indispens - able for EGF internalization mediated by clathrin - coated pits . Internalization of insulin into CHO - IR cells is inhibited by overexpres - sion of the epsin ENTH domain ( 15 ) , which may indicate a competitive inhibition of ENTH - phosphoinositide binding . All known proteins carrying ENTH domains , such as epsin , AP180 , and Hip1R ( Sla2p ) , have been reported to bind clathrin and AP - 2 directly or to colocalize with clathrin - coated pits ( 2 , 4 , 16 , 17 ) . This family of proteins is thought to play a regulatory role in the formation of coated pits , invagination of the plasma mem - brane , or the formation of coated vesicles ( 2 , Fig . 2 .

In this process , ENTH domains may regulate the linkage of the clathrin triskelion to the plasma membrane through phos - phoinositides [ Web fig . 3 ( 10 ) ] .

Model of the interaction of the ENTH domain with Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . The NH 2 - terminal unstructured region ( residues 1 through 18 ) was oriented near the (cid:222)rst helix , and Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 was then modeled in the bind - ing site to avoid steric clashes . The orientation of the Lys 76 side chain was altered toward the phosphate group of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . Modeling was performed with the program Insight98 ( MSI , San Diego , CA ) .

J . Ford , Barbara M . F . Pearse , Matthew K . Higgins , Yvonne Vallis , David J . Owen , Adele Gibson , * Colin R . Hopkins , * Philip R . Evans , † Harvey T . McMahon † Adaptor protein 180 ( AP180 ) and its homolog , clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein ( CALM ) , are closely related proteins that play im - portant roles in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Here , we present the structure of the NH 2 - terminal domain of CALM bound to phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] via a lysine - rich motif . This motif is found in other proteins predicted to have domains of similar structure ( for example , Hun - tingtin interacting protein 1 ) . The structure is in part similar to the epsin NH 2 - terminal ( ENTH ) domain , but epsin lacks the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding site . Because AP180 could bind to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and clathrin simultaneously , it may serve to tether clathrin to the membrane . This was shown by using puri(cid:222)ed components and a budding assay on preformed lipid monolayers . In the pres - ence of AP180 , clathrin lattices formed on the monolayer . When AP2 was also present , coated pits were formed . Budding of clathrin - coated vesicles is a pro - cess by which cells package specific cargo into vesicles in a regulated fashion ( 1 – 3 ) . Important functions are the uptake of nutri - ents , the regulation of receptor and transport - er numbers on the plasma membrane , and the recycling of synaptic vesicles . AP180 and AP2 are both major components of clathrin coats . AP2 is a heterotetrameric complex that binds to phosphoinositides in the membrane and to the cytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins destined for internalization ( 1 , 3 , 4 ) . AP2 binds clathrin and can stimulate clathrin cage assembly in vitro ( 5 , 6 ) . It also interacts with a range of cytoplasmic proteins includ - ing AP180 ( 7 ) . Like AP2 , AP180 also binds directly to clathrin and can stimulate clathrin cage assembly in vitro , limiting the size dis - tribution of the resulting cages ( 8 – 11 ) . The related proteins , CALM ( AP180 - 2 , a close homolog of synaptic AP180 ) , LAP ( the Dro - sophila AP180 homolog ) , and UNC - 11 ( the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog ) , are all im - plicated in clathrin - coated vesicle endocyto - sis ( 12 , 13 ) . CALM was identified and named because of its homology to AP180 and to reflect its involvement in t ( 10 ; 11 ) chromo - somal translocations found in various leuke - mias ( 14 ) . Disruptions of the LAP and Unc - 11 genes impair clathrin - dependent recycling of synaptic vesicles , resulting in fewer vesi - cles of more variable size . The NH 2 - terminal domain of AP180 ( AP180 - N ) shows the highest degree of conservation across AP180 homologs , and binds to inositol polyphos - phates ( 10 , 15 , 16 ) , whereas the COOH - terminal domain contains the putative clath - rin - and AP2 - binding sites ( Fig . 1A ) . When expressed in COS - 7 fibroblasts , both full - length AP180 and AP180 - C ( residues 530 to 915 ) inhibited uptake of epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and transferrin ( 17 ) ( Fig . 1B ) , as is the case for CALM ( 18 ) . Clathrin was redis - tributed in transfected cells , and we noted fewer coated pits per unit of cell surface – membrane length ( 8 % of control , Fig . 1C ) . This showed that endocytosis was inhibited by blocking clathrin - coated pit formation , consistent with the ability of the COOH - terminus to bind clath - rin and to stimulate cage assembly in vitro ( 8 – 11 ) . However , AP180 - N overexpression did not inhibit EGF or transferrin uptake ( Fig . 1B ) . It had no apparent protein - binding partners but is more localized to the plasma membrane , consistent with binding to polyphosphoinosi - tides ( 15 , 16 ) . To probe the molecular basis of phospho - inositide interactions , we solved the structure of the NH 2 - terminal domain from the close AP180 homolog , CALM , at 2 Å resolution ( 19 , 20 ) ( crystals of AP180 - N did not diffract well ) . There were nine a helices forming a solenoid structure ( Fig . 2 ) . This is reminis - cent of other protein families formed from a superhelix of a helices such as the armadillo ( 21 ) and tetratricopeptide repeat ( 22 ) do - mains , but it is most similar to the ENTH domain of epsin ( 23 ) ( Fig . 2B ) . The first seven helices of epsin superimposed well on those of CALM . In epsin , however , the final a 8 helix folded back across the others , whereas in CALM the final three long helices continued the solenoidal pattern . Because of the high sequence homology of CALM - N and AP180 - N ( 81 % sequence identity ) ( Fig . 2 ) , we can safely assume that the NH 2 - termi - nal domain of AP180 has the same structure . X - ray data were collected at 2 Å resolution from CALM - N crystals soaked in a series of inositol phosphates and phospholipids . Binding was observed for inositol hexakisphosphate ( D - myo - inositol - 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 - hexakisphosphate , InsP 6 ) , inositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ Ins ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] , and a soluble short - chain ( diC 8 ) L - a - D - myo - phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate . No sig - nificant binding was observed in the crystal for short - chain ( diC 8 ) L - a - D - myo - phosphatidylino - sitol - 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate . The binding site is unusual ( Fig . 2 ) : Typical ligand - binding sites on proteins lie in a pocket or groove , but this site is on the surface , with the phosphates perched on the tips of the side chains of three lysines and a histidine , like a ball balanced on the fingertips . In all ligands , only the two phosphates were well ordered and contacted the protein . The cluster of lysines and histidine formed a marked positively charged patch on the surface ( Fig . 2C ) , appropriate for a phos - phate - binding protein . Database searches with the AP180 - N / CALM - N identified several classes of related sequences ( Fig . 2H ) . First , there were the members of the AP180 family itself , with a conserved NH 2 - terminal domain , having PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding motifs , which we iden - tified from the observed binding in the crys - tal , K ( X ) 9 KX ( K / R ) ( H / Y ) . The COOH - termi - nal domains of these proteins contain clath - rin - binding motifs ( 3 , 24 ) , as well as Asp - Pro - Phe ( DPF ) - like a - and b - adaptin – Medical Research Council ( MRC ) Laboratory of Mo - lecular Biology , Hills Road , Cambridge , CB2 2QH , UK . * MRC Laboratory of Molecular and Cell Biology , Uni - versity College London , Gower Street , London , WC1E 6BT , UK . † To whom correspondence should be addressed .
