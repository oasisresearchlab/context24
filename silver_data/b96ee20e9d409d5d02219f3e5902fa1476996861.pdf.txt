Here , by using the highly metastatic rat adenocarcinoma cell line MTLn3 - epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , we assess the role of p140Cap in metastasis formation . Orthotopic transplantation of MTLn3 - EGFR cells over - expressing p140Cap in Rag2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) c c (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice resulted in normal primary tumor growth compared with the controls . Strikingly , p140Cap over - expression causes an 80 % inhibition in the number of lung metastases . p140Cap over - expressing cells display a 50 % reduction in directional cell migration , an increased number and size of focal adhesions , and a strong impairment in the ability to invade in a 3D matrix . p140Cap over - expression affects EGFR signaling and tyrosine phosphor - ylation of cortactin in response to EGF stimulation . Intriguingly , p140Cap associates with cortactin via interac - tion with its second proline - rich domain to the cortactin SH3 domain . The phosphomimetic cortactin tyrosine 421 mutant rescues migration and invasive properties in p140Cap over - expressing cells . Taken together , these data demonstrate that p140Cap suppresses the invasive proper - ties of highly metastatic breast carcinoma cells by inhibiting cortactin - dependent cell motility . Oncogene ( 2012 ) 31 , 624 – 633 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / onc . 2011 . 257 ; published online 4 July 2011 Keywords : p140Cap ; cortactin ; tumor invasion ; metas - tasis ; breast cancer Introduction Metastatic breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in Western countries . Metastasis formation is a multi - step process in which malignant cells spread from the primary tumor to colonize distant organs . Understanding the critical players involved in these processes is crucial to counteract cancer dissemination . In addition , it is important to develop good in vivo models to analyze each step of the metastatic spread . Rat mammary adenocarcinoma MTLn3 cells have been identiﬁed on the basis of gene proﬁling as a suitable model to study breast cancer progression and treatment ( Neri and Nicolson , 1981 ; Marxfeld et al . , 2006 ) and to follow actin cytoskeleton remodeling in live carcinoma cells ( Lorenz et al . , 2004 ) . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is often over - expressed in breast cancer , resulting not only in uncontrolled cell prolifera - tion ( Citri and Yarden , 2006 ; Normanno et al . , 2006 ) but also in increased tumor cell motility and invasion ( Condeelis and Segall , 2003 ) . In particular , over - expres - sion of EGFR in MTLn3 mammary adenocarcinoma cells results in increased cell motility in vivo in the primary tumor and intravasation and lung metastasis formation ( Xue et al . , 2006 ) . We have recently established that the increased expression of the EGFR in the MTLn3 cell line is essential for efﬁcient lung metastasis formation in the Rag2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) g c (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice model ( Le Devedec et al . , 2009 ) . p140Cap , also known as SNIP ( Chin et al . , 2000 ) , is an adaptor protein that directly associates to Src and Csk kinases , and interferes with integrin / growth factor - dependent Src kinase activity , thus affecting tumor properties in cancer cells ( Di Stefano et al . , 2007 ; Cabodi et al . , 2010 ; Damiano et al . , 2010 ) . We have recently reported that p140Cap is absent in 70 % of human mammary carcinomas , including the aggressive Node þ samples ( Damiano et al . , 2010 ) , showing an inverse correlation with the state of malignancy . The modular structure of p140Cap is characterized by a tyrosine - rich and two proline - rich regions ( Chin et al . , 2000 ; Di Stefano et al . , 2004 ; Damiano et al . , 2010 ) that enable binding to effector molecules , such as Csk and Src , respectively ( Di Stefano et al . , 2007 ; Damiano et al . , 2010 ) . Mechanistically , p140Cap binds to and activates Csk kinase , phosphorylating Src on the inhibitory tyrosine 527 , leading to its inactivation . Src inhibition results in impaired phosphorylation of the Fak ( focal Received 5 December 2010 ; revised 22 April 2011 ; accepted 2 May 2011 ; published online 4 July 2011 Correspondence : B van de Water , Division of Toxicology , Leiden Amsterdam Center for Drug Research ( LACDR ) , Leiden University , Leiden , The Netherlands or Professor P Deﬁlippi , Department of Genetics , Biology and Biochemistry , Molecular Biotechnology Centre , University of Torino , Via Nizza 52 , Via Santena 19 , Torino 10126 , Italy .

As a second event , p140Cap can directly affect Ras activation , thereby regulating cell proliferation . Therefore , p140Cap oper - ates as an oncosuppressor , inhibiting in vitro and in vivo tumor growth ( Di Stefano et al . , 2007 ; Damiano et al . , 2010 ) . We have already reported that p140Cap regulates cell spreading and in vitro cancer cell scattering , motility and invasion in MCF7 breast and in HT29 colon cancer cells ( Di Stefano et al . , 2007 ; Damiano et al . , 2010 ) . In this work , we have utilized the highly metastatic MTLn3 - EGFR cells in order to investigate the involvement of p140Cap in lung metastasis formation . We provide evidence that high levels of p140Cap drastically reduce the number of lung metastasis induced after the injection of MTLn3 - EGFR cells in Rag2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) g c (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice by affecting the early steps of cortactin - dependent motility and invasion . Results p140Cap over - expression inhibits anchorage - independent growth of MTLn3 - EGFR cells p140Cap was ectopically expressed in MTLn3 - GFP - EGFR ( MTLn3 - EGFR ) cells by viral transduction with an empty pBabe ( Ctr ) or with a pBabe - p140Cap ( p140 ) retrovirus followed by selection with puromycin . As shown in Figure 1A , the basal level of p140Cap expression is increased by at least fourfold in p140 cells compared with the Ctr cells . In standard tissue culture conditions , p140 cells do not show a signiﬁcant decrease in 2D cell proliferation compared with controls after 5 days in culture ( Figure 1B ) . However , in soft agar assays , MTLn3 - EGFR p140 cells formed 70 % less colonies compared with Ctr cells . Moreover , the colonies formed by p140 cells had a signiﬁcantly reduced area ( Figure 1C ) . Interestingly , while Ctr cells formed colonies of hetero - geneous shape , either round and compact or with extended protrusions , colonies formed by p140Cap over - expressing cells were all compact ( Figure 1C , panels a – d ) . These data show that p140Cap over - expression reduces anchorage - independent growth of MTLn3 - EGFR cells . p140Cap over - expression inhibits lung metastasis formation MTLn3 - EGFR rat adenocarcinoma cells are an interesting model to study in vivo tumor metastasis . When injected into Rag2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) g c (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice , they efﬁciently form lung metastasis from primary tumors within 1 month from injection ( Le Devedec et al . , 2009 ) . To assess the in vivo role of p140Cap in metastasis onset , MTLn3 - EGFR Ctr and p140 cells were injected into the mammary fat pads of Rag2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) g c (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice and tumor growth was monitored for 4 weeks . Animals were then killed at day 25 , and lungs were analyzed for sponta - neous lung metastasis formation . Tumors resulting from the Ctr and p140 cells were indistinguishable by volume and weight ( Figures 2a and b ) . Also , imaging of the primary tumor with two - photon excitation did not reveal clear visible differences in tumor organization and structure of the collagen extracellular matrix ( Supplementary Figure S1a ) . However , of particular interest , mice injected with p140Cap over - expressing cells show an 80 % decrease in the number of lung metastases compared with control cells ( Figures 2c and d ) . In addition , in the p140Cap group , the metastases were smaller in size compared with the control group when analyzed with confocal laser scanning microscopy ( Supplementary Figure S1b ) . The reduction of lung metastases could be explained by either a defect in angiogenesis or a lower capacity of the p140Cap cells to be invasive . However , intravital imaging performed in the primary tumors indicated that the motility of p140Cap cells was reduced as we Figure 1 p140Cap over - expression affects anchorage - independent tumor growth . ( A ) Cell lysates from MTLn3 - EGFR Ctr and p140 cells were analyzed by 6 % sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . Western blot was performed using p140Cap and tubulin - speciﬁc antibodies . ( B ) In all , 3 (cid:3) 10 3 MTLn3 - EGFR Ctr and p140 cells were plated in 24 - well plates and grown for 5 days . Cell proliferation was evaluated by 3 ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay every day . Absorbance at 540nm from three separate experiments is reported on the y axis . ( C ) In all , 8 (cid:3) 10 3 Ctr and p140 cells were plated in soft agar and allowed to grow for 2 weeks . ( Upper panels ) Cells were photo - graphed at (cid:3) 4 magniﬁcation . Eight representative pictures are shown . ( Lower panels ) Number of colonies ( left histogram ) and area ( right ) were analyzed using ImageJ and the mean data from three separate experiments is reported in the histograms ( * P o 0 . 05 ) . p140Cap inhibition of cell invasion and metastasis formation L Damiano et al 625 Oncogene were unable to visualize cell movement in these tumors , whereas in the control group many migrating cells ( Supplementary Figure S2a ) and protrusion events ( Supplementary Figure S2b ) were observed in tumors . Thus ectopic expression of p140Cap expression does not affect MTLn3 - EGFR tumor formation , but strongly inhibits the metastatic process of these highly invasive cells . p140Cap inhibits directed cell migration Motility is a fundamental property of cancer cells that escape from the primary tumor and invade into new tissues . To assess the role of p140Cap in cell motility , MTLn3 - EGFR Ctr and p140Cap cells were serum starved for 4 h , stimulated with EGF and analyzed for random and directional cell migration at different times . The speed of cells in a random cell migration assay in response to EGF was similar between the two cell types ( Figure 3a ; Supplementary Figure S3 ) . Yet , stable p140Cap knockdown in MTLn3 - EGFR cells caused an increase in cell velocity under control conditions , indicative for a role of p140Cap in controlling random cell migration events ( Supplementary Figure S4 , panels c and d ) . EGF stimulation of these shp40Cap - MTLn3 - EGFR cells was , however , not different from MTLn3 - EGFR , suggesting that a maximal stimulation of cell migration is reached under these conditions . This enhanced migration of shp140Cap - MTLn3 - EGFR cells was associated with a clear change in spindle - like elongated cell morphology in both culture conditions that upon EGF treatment , which is typical of motile tumor cells ( Supplementary Figure S4 , panels a , c and d ) . Similar ﬁndings were observed for transient small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - based knockdown of p140Cap in MTLn3 - EGFR cells ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . In the directional migration observed in wound - healing or transwell assays , p140 cells displayed a 50 % reduction in the ability to migrate compared with control cells ( Figures 3b and c ) , thus indicating that p140Cap affects directionality of cell migration , but not cell speed . Cell migration requires dramatic changes in cell shape and in adhesion to the extracellular matrix , and both these processes must be spatiotemporally coordinated ( Wolfenson et al . , 2009 ; Gardel et al . , 2010 ) . To analyze focal adhesions and actin cytoskeleton , MTLn3 - EGFR Ctr and p140Cap cells were plated on collagen , serum deprived for 4 h and stimulated with EGF for 5 – 15 min . As shown in Figure 4a , p140 cells show increased paxillin staining of focal adhesions compared with control cells . Remarkably , the difference in focal adhesions was highly evident in serum - starved cells ( Figure 4a , right panels ) and the quantiﬁcation showed that both the area and the number of focal adhesions were increased both in basal conditions and following EGF stimulation ( Figures 4c and d ) . To visualize the focal adhesions localized on the ventral cell surface , we used the evanescent ﬁeld of total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence excitation . Total internal reﬂection ﬂuores - cence images revealed the presence of a higher number of punctuate focal adhesions in p140 cells , both unstimulated or stimulated with EGF , compared with Figure 2 p140Cap over - expression inhibits spontaneous lung metastasis formation . ( a ) In all , 5 (cid:3) 10 5 Ctr and p140 cells were injected subcutaneously in Rag2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) g c (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . Tumor volume was measured twice a week for 25 days and reported on the y axis ( n ¼ 22 ) . ( b ) When the mice were killed , tumors were removed and weighed . The weight of tumors is reported on the y axis . ( c ) ( Right panels ) After killing the mice , lungs were colored with ink , metastasis were counted and the number of metastasis reported in the y axis of the histogram . Statistical signiﬁcances were evaluated by Student’s t - test : Ctr EGF vs p140 EGF ( * P o 0 . 05 ) . ( d ) ( Upper panels ) Two representative pictures of lung metastases visualized with the FLI ( GFP detection ) after spontaneous metastasis assay with the MTLn3 - EGFR Ctr and p140 cells . ( Lower panels ) Two representative pictures of the lungs colored with ink are shown . p140Cap inhibition of cell invasion and metastasis formation L Damiano et al 626 Oncogene control cells ( Figure 4b ) . Consistent with the increase in focal adhesion organization , phalloidin staining revealed that in p140 cells , actin was mainly organized in stress ﬁbers ( Figure 4a , right medium panels ) . Using total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence , p140 cells showed a marked amount of actin stress ﬁbers on the ventral surface in both starved and EGF - stimulated cells ( Figure 4b ) . To further support a role for p140Cap in regulating focal adhesion protein dynamics , decreased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of Fak ( Tyr925 ) and of paxillin ( Tyr118 ) have been detected in p140Cap over - expressing MTLn3 - EGFR cells compared with control cells ( data not shown ) . Thus , p140Cap over - expression in MTLn3 - EGFR cells imposes an increased organization of focal adhesions that correlates with enhanced formation of actin stress ﬁbers . p140Cap impairs cell invasion in 3D conditions To assess the role of p140Cap in cell invasion , MTLn3 - EGFR Ctr and p140Cap cells were analyzed using three different approaches . As a ﬁrst step in the invasive process , metastatic tumor cells , cultured on a ﬂat gelatin matrix substratum , extend specialized proteolytically active plasma membrane protrusions . These structures , termed invadopodia , are responsible for the focal degradation of the underlying substrate ( Buccione et al . , 2009 ) . To evaluate the ability to degrade the substratum , cells were plated directly on crosslinked TRITC - labeled gelatin in the presence of a metallopro - tease inhibitor ( GM6001 ) and allowed to adhere and spread overnight . During this period no ECM degrada - tion was observed . Upon GM6001 washout , cells resumed the ability to degrade the matrix . Areas of degradation underlying the cells were counted using a confocal microscope . As shown in Figure 5a , p140 cells gave rise to 50 % less degradation compared with control cells . In the second assay , cells were plated on classical matrigel - coated transwells and allowed to invade the 3D extracellular matrix for 48 h . As shown in Figure 5b , p140Cap over - expressing cells were dramatically impaired in their ability to invade compared with control cells . As a third alternative invasion assay , cells were grown as spheroids in 3D collagen matrix that were monitored within 3 days for cell crawl - out . While Ctr cells escaped from the central spheroids as single cells within 48 h , p140Cap over - expressing cells were signiﬁcantly impaired in their ability to move out ( Figure 5c ) . Consistently , shp140Cap - MTLn3 - EGFR cells were more invasive than control MTLn3 - EGFR cells in 3D collagen matrix spheroid invasion assays ( Supplementary Figure S4 , panel g ) . Taken together , these data indicate that p140Cap expression regulates the ability of MTLn3 - EGFR cells to invade in a 3D matrix by controlling the initial degradation events at the cell – ECM interface and the subsequent invasive processes . p140Cap regulates cell migration through cortactin interaction and phosphorylation Our previous results have shown that increased expres - sion of EGFR in the MTLn3 rat mammary tumor cell Figure 3 p140Cap over - expression affects cell migration . In all the experiments , the cells were serum deprived for 4h and stimulated with 5n M EGF . ( a ) Random migration of MTLn3 - EGFR Ctr and p140 cells was visualized with both GFP ﬂuorescence and DIC ( differential interference contrast ) . Migration speed ( m m / min ) is indicated in the graph ( * P o 0 . 05 ) . ( b ) Conﬂuent monolayers were subjected to scratch wounding and incubated in serum - free media with or without EGF . After 10h of migration , wound closure was photographed and quantiﬁed using ImageJ . Data were averaged from three independent experiments . Statistical signiﬁcances were evaluated by Student’s t - test : Ctr EGF vs p140 EGF ( * P o 0 . 05 ) . ( c ) Ctr and p140 cells were tested for migration in a transwell assay . Cells were left to migrate for 5h in the presence or the absence of EGF then ﬁxed , stained and counted . Mean values were calculated on three independent experiments . Statistical signiﬁcances were evaluated by Student’s t - test : Ctr EGF vs p140 EGF ( * P o 0 . 05 ) . p140Cap inhibition of cell invasion and metastasis formation L Damiano et al 627 Oncogene line is essential for efﬁcient lung metastasis formation in the Rag mouse model , by strongly enhancing intravasa - tion and lung metastasis ( Le Devedec et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , we have already demonstrated that p140Cap regulates c - Src and EGFR activation in MCF7 breast cancer cells ( Di Stefano et al . , 2007 ; Damiano et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , to test whether p140Cap could affect EGFR signaling in this model , MTLn3 - EGFR Ctr and p140Cap cells were stimulated with EGF , and EGFR activation was evaluated using a phosphospeciﬁc anti - body that recognizes phopshorylated Tyr1173 , one of the autophosphorylation sites of EGFR . p140 cells show a 60 % decrease in EGFR Tyr1173 phosphoryla - tion . Once activated , EGFR induces activation of downstream effectors , such as mitogenic - activated protein kinase Erk1 / 2 and c - Src . Indeed , in p140 over - expressing cells , Erk1 / 2 phosphorylation was decreased by 50 % in response to EGF , and Src kinase activation was also completely impaired ( Figure 6a ) . There - fore , in MTLn3 - EGFR cells , p140Cap over - expression negatively regulates early activation of EGFR and downstream signaling . A known Src substrate is cortactin , whose phosphor - ylation is necessary for regulating actin dynamics , cell motility and invasion ( Head et al . , 2003 ; Lua and Low , 2005 ) . Moreover , cortactin has been shown to control the stages of invadopodia assembly and maturation ( Ayala et al . , 2008 ; Oser et al . , 2009 ; Mader et al . , 2011 ) and cortactin phosphorylation on tyrosines 421 , 428 and 486 is a master switch during these processes . When MTLn3 - EGFR Ctr and p140Cap cells were stimulated with EGF , cortactin was found to be phosphorylated on Tyr421 in response to EGF in Ctr cells . In p140 cells , however , cortactin phosphorylation was decreased by 50 % ( Figure 6a ) , indicating that p140Cap - dependent inhibition of Src kinase also leads to reduced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation . Interestingly , p140Cap affects Src activation and cortactin phosphorylation in response to EGF also in highly metastatic mouse 4T1 and human 4175 ( MDA - MB - 231 - Lung ) breast tumor Figure 4 p140Cap regulates focal adhesions and actin organization and dynamics . ( a ) Ctr and p140 cells were ﬁxed at different time points after exposure to EGF ( 10n M ) and stained for paxillin ( green ) and F - actin ( red ) and analyzed by confocal microscopy . ( b ) Ctr and p140 cells exposed or not to 10n M EGF ( 5min ) were ﬁxed and stained for paxillin and imaged by total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy .

Moreover , p140Cap silencing also enhances Src activation and cortactin phosphorylation in response to EGF ( Supplementary Figure S4 , panel b ) . To conﬁrm that in MTLn3 - EGFR cells , cortactin and its phosphorylation are crucial for the invasion process , cortactin was silenced , followed by re - expression of full - length ( FL ) cortactin and of the phosphomimetic cortactin mutant Y421D in which the primary SFK - phosphorylated residue 421 has been changed to aspartic acid . As shown in Supplementary Figure S6 , siRNAs targeting endogenous cortactin induced an increase in F - actin stress ﬁber formation , which was associated with a reduced overall motility of cells ( Supplementary Figure S7 , panels a and c ) . While the subsequent expression of FL cortactin was unable to rescue this reduced cell motility , Y421D mutant cortactin recovered the ability of cells to properly migrate . This rescue of cell migration was related to the recovery of degradation of gelatin ( Supplementary Figure S7 , panels b , c and d ) . Intriguingly , we have recently shown that p140Cap and cortactin immunoprecipitate in HeLa cells trans - fected with green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - p140Cap cells ( Jaworski et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore , p140Cap was immunoprecipitated from MTLn3 - EGFR GFP Ctr cells , and p140Cap and cortactin were shown to co - immunoprecipitate ( Figure 6b ) , indicating that they associate in the same complex in the invasive cells used in this study . Cortactin and p140Cap are both multi - domain proteins with many binding partners ( Weaver , 2008 ; Cabodi et al . , 2010 ) . p140Cap has two proline - rich domains and cortactin has an SH3 domain that may be involved in this binding . To test this hypothesis , HEK293 cells were co - transfected with p140Cap and wild - type RFP - cortactin ( Cort ) or the DeltaSH3 mutant RFP - cortactin ( Delta ) and subjected to immuno - precipitation using anti - RFP monoclonal antibodies . As shown in Figure 6c , the p140Cap – cortactin interac - tion was dramatically impaired in the presence of the DeltaSH3 cortactin mutant , indicating that the SH3 cortactin domain is required for their association . Moreover , when HEK293 cells were transfected with a p140Cap - deleted mutant lacking amino acids 1000 – 1048 , which include speciﬁcally the PPPPPRR sequence in the second proline - rich domain of p140Cap ( DeltaPro ) ( Di Stefano et al . , 2007 ) , co - immunoprecipi - tation of p140Cap and endogenous cortactin was strongly impaired ( Figure 6d ) . Moreover , expression of this mutant in the MTLn3 - EGFR cells does not affect gelatin degradation ability compared with the FL p140Cap expression ( Figure 6e ) . Overall , these data show that p140Cap interacts with cortactin through the second proline - rich domain and that p140Cap / cortactin binding correlates with the observed decrease in gelatin degradation . To assess the involvement of cortactin in p140Cap - dependent inhibition of cell motility , a Y421D mutant was transfected in p140 cells . Transfected cells were subjected to both a transwell assay and a gelatin degradation assay . Expression of the Y421D mutant rescued transwell cell migration , recovering the ability of p140 cells to migrate to the same extent as control cells ( Figure 6f ) . Moreover , the same mutant was also able to recover the ability of p140Cap cells to degrade the substratum ( Figure 6g ) . Taken together , these data show that p140Cap - dependent inhibition of cortactin phos - Figure 5 p140Cap impairs cell invasion in 3D conditions .

Cells were then stained with Alexa633 phalloidin and photographed by confocal microscopy using a (cid:3) 63 magniﬁcation . Degradations were counted in 10random ﬁelds / coverslips .

Discussion Our ﬁndings identify the adaptor protein p140Cap as a critical regulator of in vitro cell motility and invasion and in vivo metastasis formation of highly metastatic MTLn3 - EGFR breast cancer cells . We also demonstrate that in these cells p140Cap , without affecting primary tumor growth , impairs the early steps of motility and invasion , by affecting cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , thus resulting in the inhibition of cortactin - dependent invasive properties . The formation of lung metastasis is a multi - step process , dependent on cancer cell autonomous biological programs that deﬁne migration , intravasation survival and extravasation of tumor cells ( Condeelis and Segall , 2003 ) . The data presented here show that increasing p140Cap expression in the highly aggressive MTLn3 - EGFR cells results in an 80 % decrease in in vivo lung metastasis formation , providing the ﬁrst evidence that p140Cap acts as an effective negative regulator of the metastatic process . Consistently , p140Cap over - expressing MTLn3 - EGFR cells show also reduced anchorage - independent cell growth , which is an in vitro characteristic that predicts the in vivo metastatic potential of many tumor cells ( Mori et al . , 2009 ) . Figure 6 p140Cap regulates cell migration through cortactin interaction and phosphorylation . ( a ) Cells were serum starved and stimulated with EGF for 5min . Cell extracts were analyzed on western blots using phospho - EGFR ( Tyr1173 ) , phospho - p42 / 44 Erk1 / 2 , phospho - Src ( Tyr416 ) and phospho - cortactin ( Tyr421 ) antibodies .

Statistical signiﬁcances were evaluated by Student’s t - test : Ctr EGF vs p140 EGF ( * P o 0 . 05 ) . p140Cap inhibition of cell invasion and metastasis formation L Damiano et al 630 Oncogene To become metastatic , cancer cells have to detach from primary tumors , re - organize the actin cytoskele - ton , migrate toward a stimulus and subsequently invade ( Sahai , 2007 ) . Interestingly , performing two - photon intravital imaging on both control and p140Cap - over - expressing tumors , we were able to easily detect and track a highly motile cell population only present in control tumors , and not in the p140Cap over - expressing tumors , which show poor motility . Moreover , p140Cap over - expressing cells were also more refractory than control cells to move out from cell spheroids embedded into a 3D collagen matrix . Consistently , p140Cap silenced MTLn3 - EGFR cells were more invasive com - pared than MTLn3 - EGFR control cells . Overall , these ﬁndings indicate that p140Cap is an important regulator of the early steps in metastasis onset , affecting the initial process of cell escape from the tumor . Furthermore , detailed in vitro analysis of cell migra - tory and invasive abilities showed that p140Cap over - expressing cells have an impaired capacity to migrate in response to EGF . Interestingly , p140Cap cells only show a defect in directional cell migration , but not in random cell migration . A prerequisite for cell migration is the tight assembly and disassembly cycle of focal adhesions , mechanosensory signaling structures that are observed at the basal surface of the cells in 2D cultures ( Webb et al . , 2005 ; Gardel et al . , 2010 ) . Remarkably , p140Cap over - expressing cells display an increased number and area of focal adhesions , which correlate with the presence of actin stress ﬁbers . While in MTLn3 - EGFR untreated control cells , focal adhesions are poorly visible and organize only under the EGF stimulus , in p140Cap over - expressing cells , both focal adhesions and stress ﬁbers are already present in unstimulated cells and treatment with EGF does not change their number or morphology . Upon knockdown of p140Cap in MTLn3 - EGFR cells , the cells have a more elongated motile phenotype compared with control cells . Thus , high levels of p140Cap induce a re - organization of focal adhesions and actin stress ﬁbers consistent with a less dynamic turnover of adhesive structures ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2005 ; Webb et al . , 2005 ) . Consistent with a role for p140Cap in regulating focal adhesion protein dynamics , MTLn3 - EGFR cells over - expressing p140Cap show decreased levels of tyrosine phosphor - ylation of FAK and paxillin ( data not shown ) . More - over , we have previously shown that p140Cap also regulates p130Cas phosphorylation and Rac activation in MCF7 cells ( Di Stefano et al . , 2007 ) , indicating that p140Cap may be a crucial regulator of directional cell migration , by speciﬁcally controlling the extent of phosphorylation and activation of focal adhesion components relevant for focal adhesion assembly ( Ilic et al . , 1995 ; Lim et al . , 2008 ) . In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that in MTLn3 - EGFR cells , EGFR expression enhances invasiveness without affecting tumor growth ( Xue et al . , 2006 ) , indicating that the contribution of the EGFR to metastasis is independent of its effect on proliferation . Overall , our data demonstrate that p140Cap does not impair primary tumor growth , but profoundly disrupts migratory and invasive properties of MTLn3 - EGFR cells , by antagonizing early EGFR signaling in these cells . Indeed , the high levels of p140Cap in MTLn3 - EGFR cells result in impaired activation of EGFR , Erk1 / 2 mitogenic - activated protein kinase and Src kinase in response to EGF . Similar results were also obtained in the highly metastatic mouse 4T1 cells . In our previous work we have already demonstrated that p140Cap interferes with integrin / EGF - induced Src kinase activity , also in cells that express endogenous levels of EGFR such as the luminal A MCF7 breast cancer and the HT29 colon cancer cells ( Di Stefano et al . , 2007 ; Damiano et al . , 2010 ) . There - fore , p140Cap behaves as a general regulator of EGF signaling , mostly affecting the Src kinase pathway . Cortactin is a major substrate of Src kinase and localizes to cortical actin structures , where it regulates early cell migration and invasion by controlling actin assembly ( Wu et al . , 1991 ; Wu and Parsons , 1993 ; Weed et al . , 2000 ) , and its phosphorylation by Src is correlated with enhanced metastasis in breast cancer cells ( Li et al . , 2001 ) . Cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown to regulate MTLn3 cells invadopodia assembly and maturation ( Oser et al . , 2009 ) . Our results show that in p140Cap over - expressing cells , cortactin phosphor - ylation on Tyr421 in response to EGF is decreased . Interestingly , p140Cap affects Src activation and cor - tactin phosphorylation in response to EGF also in highly metastatic mouse 4T1 and human 4175 ( MDA - MB - 231 - Lung ) breast tumor cells ( Supplementary Fig - ure S6 ) . Indeed , the expression of the phosphomimetic cortactin mutant Y421D is sufﬁcient to completely rescue the defects in migration and invasion of MTLn3 - EGFR p140Cap over - expressing cells . Moreover , con - ﬁrming our previous data ( Jaworski et al . , 2009 ) , p140Cap is a partner of cortactin in MTLn3 - EGFR cells . Their association requires the second proline - rich domain of p140Cap and the cortactin SH3 domain , suggesting a direct interaction between the two proteins . The p140Cap mutant that does not associate cortactin is no more able to impair gelatine degradation as p140Cap does , suggesting that p140Cap binding to cortactin leads to decreased invasion . Overall , our results provide evidence that p140Cap regulates the extent of migration and invasion by affecting the EGFR / Src / cortactin pathway . In conclusion , these ﬁndings identify p140Cap as a new regulator of the early steps of metastasis onset . Indeed , p140Cap associates with cortactin and regulates EGF - dependent cortactin phosphorylation , likely via inhibition of early EGF - dependent EGFR and Src signaling . These events result in defective directional cell motility , and 3D invasion leading to suppression of migratory and invasive properties of highly aggressive breast cancer cells .

MTLn3 - EGFR Ctr and p140 cells were obtained infecting MTLn3 - EGFR cells with empty pBABE and p140Cap - pBABE ( Damiano et al . , 2010 ) retroviruses and selecting using 1 m g / ml puromycin . Myc p140Cap FL and Myc p140Cap DeltaPro have been previously described ( Di Stefano et al . , 2007 ) . Myc p140Cap C - Term mutant has been originated by digesting the FL with Nhe - Kpn and cloning the fragment in pcDNA3 Myc . RFP - cortactin wild - type , RFP - cortactin 3YF , RFP - cortactin DeltaSH3 , cortactin - ﬂag wild - type and cortactin - ﬂag Y421D constructs were previously described ( Ayala et al . , 2008 ) . They were transfected in MTLn3 - EGFR cells using Lipofectamine LTX ( Invitrogen , Paisley , UK ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium 10 % serum and penicillin / streptavidin and transfected using the calcium – phosphate method . pGIPZ - p140Cap lentiviral shRNAmir were from Open Bio - system ( Huntsville , AL , USA ) ; p140Cap and cortactin siRNAs were Smart Pools from ThermoFisher Dharmacon ( Waltham , MA , USA ) . siRNA were transfected with the Dharmafect reagent ( ThermoFisher Dharmacon ) . Proliferation and soft agar assays See Supplementary Information . Migration assays For random migration assays , cells were cultured in 24 glass - bottom plates overnight , starved for 4 h followed by visualiza - tion with high - throughput microscopy for several hours on a Nikon TE2000 - E microscope ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) equipped with perfect focus system in a humid climate of 37 1 C and 5 % CO 2 . Subsequently , cells were treated with EGF and time lapses were recorded using both GFP ﬂuorescence and differential interference contrast of the cells . Movies were captured 6min per frame with (cid:3) 20 objective . Cell speed was obtained by tracking the cells and calculating the distance between two sequential frames using an in - house developed Image J plugin ( Yan K et al . , unpublished data ) . For wound - healing assays , cells were cultured until reaching conﬂuence . Cells were serum deprived for 4h and wounded using p200 pipette tip . Cell migration was followed for 10h after EGF treatment by time lapse . Images were further quantitatively analyzed by using ImageJ software ( NIH , Bethesda , MD , USA ) . For the transwell assay , the lower side of transwells was coated with 10 m g / ml collagen . A total of 5 (cid:3) 10 4 starved cells were seeded on the upper side of the ﬁlters ( 8 m m diameter , Corning , New York , NY , USA ) and let to migrate to the bottom wells ﬁlled with 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin RPMI , and 5 n M EGF . Cells migrating to the lower side were ﬁxed and stained with Diff - Quick kit . In all , 10 ﬁeld / transwell were counted on the microscope using (cid:3) 40 magniﬁcation . Focal adhesion detection and analysis To determine cell - matrix adhesion size , we used images of MTLn3 cells stained for paxillin at different time points following EGF stimulation . Images were segmented based on paxillin staining , and the area of all individual cell - matrix adhesions was determined using ImageJ software . The average cell - matrix adhesion size of up to 30 individual cells / treatment conditions is shown . Gelatin degradation assay Gelatin degradation assays were performed on ﬂuorophore - conjugated gelatin prepared with Rhodamine B isothiocyanate ( Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) and porcine gelatin ( Sigma ) according to Ayala et al . ( 2008 ) . Gelatin - coated coverslips were prepared and assays were carried out as described previously ( Bowden et al . , 2001 ; Baldassarre et al . , 2006 ) . Brieﬂy , thin layers of Rhodamine B - conjugated gelatin were placed on coverslips , crosslinked with 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde for 15 min at 0 1 C , washed three times with PBS and incubated for 3min at room temperature with 5 mg / ml NaBH 4 . Finally , after a wash and 10min incubation in 70 % ethanol , coverslips were washed with complete medium for 1h at 37 1 C before cell plating . Cells were plated directly on gelatin in the presence of 5 m M GM6001 ( Millipore , Temecula , CA , USA ) . GM6001 was washed out to allow degradation for 30min . Cells were then ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and analyzed with appropriate antibodies . Experiments were observed using a Zeiss confocal microscope using (cid:3) 63 magniﬁcation . Degradations were counted in 10 random ﬁelds / coverslips . Invasion assays For invasion assays , 5 (cid:3) 10 4 cells were seeded on the upper side of transwells coated with matrigel and allowed to invade for 48h using complete medium . Cells on the lower part of the ﬁlters were ﬁxed and stained with Diff - Quick kit . In all , 10 ﬁeld / transwell were counted using a microscope with a (cid:3) 40 magniﬁcation . For the 3D invasion assay , collagen gels were prepared from type I collagen ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s procedure . Cells were placed in collagen , allowed to form spheroids , and images were taken every 24h with a Nikon TE2000 microscope using (cid:3) 10 magniﬁcation . In vivo tumor and metastasis formation For MTLn3 - EGFR cells 6 - week - old Rag2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) g c (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice were obtained from in - house breeding . Sterilized food and water were provided ad libitum . To measure spontaneous metastasis , MTLn3 tumor cells were grown to 70 – 85 % conﬂuence and 5 (cid:3) 10 5 MTLn3 cells were injected into the right thoracic mammary fat pads of mice , in a volume of 100 m l of PBS without Ca 2 þ or Mg 2 þ using a 25 - gauge needle . Tumor growth rate was monitored weekly . Horizontal ( h ) and vertical ( v ) diameters were determined , and tumor volume ( V ) was calculated ( V ¼ 4 / 3 p ( 1 / 2 [ O ( h (cid:3) v ) ] 3 ) ) . After 3 or 4 weeks , animals were killed and lungs were excised . The right lung was used to count the tumor burden . For a rough estimation , right lungs were imaged with the FLI ( ﬂuorescent imaging ) unit IVIS . For detailed quantiﬁcation , the ﬂat side of the right lung was analyzed with an immunoﬂuorescence microscope . With a (cid:3) 10 objective lens , we screened the ﬂat surface of the lobe and counted the number of GFP - positive metastases . Subsequently , the right lung was ﬁxed in 4 % paraformalde - hyde . The left lung was injected with ink solution , de - stained in water and ﬁxed in Fekete’s ( 4 . 3 % ( v / v ) acetic acid , 0 . 35 % ( v / ) formaldehyde in 70 % ethanol ) . Statistical analysis Results are representative of at least three independent experiments and are expressed as mean values ± s . e . m . ( standard error of the mean ) .
