Abstract : Background : The ongoing global SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic has caused over 4 . 7 million infections greatly challenging healthcare workers ( HCW ) and medical institutions worldwide . The SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic has shown to significantly impact mental and physical health of HCW . Thus , implementation of testing facilities supporting HCW are urgently needed . Methods : A low - threshold SARS - CoV - 2 testing facility was introduced at the University Hospital Bonn , Germany , in March 2020 . Irrespective of clinical symptoms employees were offered a voluntary and free SARS - CoV - 2 test . Furthermore , employees returning from SARS - CoV - 2 risk regions and employees after risk contact with SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients or employees were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Pharyngeal swabs were taken and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for detection of SARS - CoV - 2 was performed , test results being available within 24 hours . Profession , symptoms and reason for SARS - CoV - 2 testing of employees were recorded . Results : Between 9th March and 30th April 2020 , a total of 1 , 510 employees were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 1 , 185 employees took advantage of the low - threshold testing facility . One percent ( n = 11 ) were tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 infection , 18 % being asymptomatic , 36 % showing mild and 36 % moderate / severe symptoms ( missing 10 % ) . Furthermore , of 56 employees returning from SARS - CoV - 2 risk regions , 18 % ( 10 / 56 ) were tested SARS - CoV - 2 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f positive . After risk contact tracking by the hospital infection control 6 patient - to - employee transmissions were identified in 163 employees with contact to 55 SARS - CoV - 2 positive patients . Conclusion : In the absence of easily accessible public SARS - CoV - 2 testing facilities low - threshold SARS - CoV - 2 testing facilities in hospitals with rapid testing resources help to identify SARS - CoV - 2 infected employees with absent or mild symptoms , thus stopping the spread of infection in vulnerable hospital environments . High levels of professional infection prevention training and implementation of specialized wards as well as a perfectly working hospital infection control network identifying and tracking risk contacts are of great importance in a pandemic setting .

Thus , 10 implementation of testing facilities supporting HCW are urgently needed . 11 12 Methods : 13 A low - threshold SARS - CoV - 2 testing facility was introduced at the University Hospital Bonn , 14 Germany , in March 2020 . Irrespective of clinical symptoms employees were offered a 15 voluntary and free SARS - CoV - 2 test . Furthermore , employees returning from SARS - CoV - 2 16 risk regions and employees after risk contact with SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients or 17 employees were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 infection .

High levels of professional infection prevention training 14 and implementation of specialized wards as well as a perfectly working hospital infection 15 control network identifying and tracking risk contacts are of great importance in a pandemic 16 setting . 17 18 19 Introduction : 20 In 2019 the World Health Organization ( WHO ) named high - threat pathogens as one of the 21 world’s top ten global health threats . The SARS - CoV - 2 outbreak has caused a global 22 pandemic with over 4 . 7 million cases around the world by the mid of May 2020 , bringing 23 great challenges to medical institutions and clinical staff worldwide 24 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 ( https : / / coronavirus . jhu . edu / map . html ) . This global major public health event is threatening 1 people‘s physical and mental health as well as life safety . High levels of training and 2 professional experience , resilience and social support has been shown to impact mental 3 health during this pandemic ( Cai et al . , 2020 ) . 4 During the ongoing outbreak of SARS - CoV - 2 in Wuhan , China , hospitals were significant 5 epicenters for human - to - human transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in healthcare workers ( HCW ) , 6 patients and visitors ( Ye et al . , 2020 ) . Thus , adequate environmental cleaning , strengthening 7 of professional infection prevention training and improvement of infection prevention 8 among HCW are urgently needed . 9 The aim of this study was to evaluate , whether offering a free , voluntary low - threshold 10 testing for all hospital staff may help to manage SARS - CoV - 2 infections in medical 11 institutions and prevent subsequent virus outbreaks . 12 13 Methods : 14 In the absence of an easily accessible public SARS - CoV - 2 testing facility a low - threshold 15 testing facility was started at the University Hospital Bonn , Germany , on 9th March 2020 . All 16 persons employed by the University Hospital Bonn got the opportunity of voluntary and free 17 SARS - CoV - 2 testing using pharyngeal swabs irrespective of current clinical symptoms . Mild 18 symptoms were defined as sore throat , fatigue , and light cough , moderate / severe symptoms 19 as fever , severe cough , loss of smell / taste and myalgia . Employees with clinical symptoms 20 ( mild and moderate / severe ) received a doctor’s note and could not return back to work 21 before they were tested negative for SARS - CoV - 2 . SARS - CoV - 2 testing was also provided for 22 employees returning from regions declared as SARS - CoV - 2 risk regions by the German 23 federal government agency and research institute responsible for disease control and 24 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 prevention in Germany ( Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) , Berlin , Germany ) , either during their 1 stay or shortly after their return ( www . rki . de / covid - 19 - risikogebiete ) . The RKI continuously 2 updated information on SARS - CoV - 2 risk regions , which were regularly implemented on the 3 University Hospital internal website . Furthermore , employees received SARS - CoV - 2 testing 4 after risk contacts with SARS - CoV - 2 positive patients or colleagues identified by the hospital 5 infection control irrespective of clinical symptoms . Risk assessment after SARS - CoV - 2 contact 6 was conducted by the hospital infection control applying equally for employee - to - employee 7 and patient - to - employee risk contact . Employees were categorized according to type and 8 time of exposure to COVID - 19 contact depending on personal protective equipment and 9 were informed personally by the hospital infection control if there was any risk of SARS - CoV - 10 2 infection when applying the current RKI risk contact definitions . Importantly , in close 11 cooperation with the Institute of Virology of the University Bonn , test results were available 12 within 24 hours after sampling . 13 Employees after return from SARS - CoV - 2 risk regions or with private or clinical SARS - CoV - 2 14 risk contacts stayed in domestic quarantine for 14 days . Only when there was staffing 15 shortage critical for the hospital infrastructure employees were allowed to return back to 16 work after one negative test , being asymptomatic , wearing a mask , leading a 7 - day 17 temperature log and repeating the test after 7 days . Serial examinations were carried out in 18 SARS - CoV - 2 positive employees , who could return back to work after 2 negative SARS - CoV - 2 19 tests in order to minimize the risk of false - negative results . A similar approach was chosen 20 for COVID - 19 patients , who stayed in isolation until 2 negative SARS - CoV - 2 results were 21 obtained . 22 Employees were categorized according to their profession as group I with direct contact to 23 patients , e . g . nurses , doctors , allied health professionals , porters etc . , group II with a non - 24 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 patient facing profession but potentially at higher risk of nosocomial exposure , e . g . domestic 1 and laboratory staff , group III working non - clinical , e . g . jobs in the hospital administration 2 and information technology , secretarial jobs etc . ( Hunter et al . , 2020 ) . Irrespective of their 3 profession group IV was defined as employees returning from high risk regions according to 4 the guidelines of the RKI . 5 This study was approved by the local ethics committee ( No . 188 / 20 ) . 6 7 Results : 8 Between 9th March 2020 and 30th April 2020 , 1 , 726 pharyngeal swabs from 1 , 510 9 employees of the University Hospital Bonn were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 infection , thereof 10 1 , 013 ( 67 % ) were women and 497 ( 33 % ) were men and the median age was 37 years ( IQR 11 29 ; 51 ) . Of a total of 7 , 460 employees of the University Hospital Bonn 16 % ( n = 1 , 185 ) took 12 advantage of the low - threshold testing facility , 56 ( 0 . 8 % ) were tested after returning from 13 SARS - CoV - 2 high risk regions and 269 ( 3 . 6 % ) were tested after risk contacts with SARS - CoV - 2 14 positive patients or infected employees . Figure 1 shows the frequency of testing during the 15 observation period according to profession . After the shutdown in Germany on 16th March 16 2020 the frequency of testing accelerated and slowed during the following week and peaked 17 again before Easter . 18 19 The low - threshold facility was used by 1 , 185 employees , the majority of whom belonged to 20 group I with direct patient contact ( 66 % ) . Only 21 % belonged to group II with a non - patient 21 facing profession and 12 % to group III , who worked non - clinical ( missing for n = 15 ) . They 22 received a SARS - CoV - 2 test without having symptoms in 36 % ( n = 425 ) , experiencing mild 23 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 symptoms in 44 % ( n = 515 ) , suffering of moderate / severe symptoms in 7 % ( n = 77 ) ( missing in 1 14 % ( n = 168 ) ) . 2 Out of these 1 , 185 employees 11 ( 1 % ) were tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . Sixty - four 3 percent ( n = 7 ) were women and the median age was 32 ( IQR 31 ; 46 ) . The majority of the 11 4 SARS - CoV - 2 positive employees belonged to group I ( n = 7 ) having direct contact to patients , 5 only one was assigned to group II and 3 to group III . Importantly , 54 % had no ( n = 2 ) or mild 6 ( n = 4 ) symptoms , while 36 % ( n = 4 ) had moderate / severe symptoms ( information missing in 7 n = 1 ) . 8 In 9 of these 11 SARS - CoV - 2 positive tested individuals 133 risk contact persons were 9 identified by the hospital infection control . One employee - to - employee transmission was 10 diagnosed by the contact tracing , however no further transmission was found in the 11 subsequent 9 identified risk contacts . The remaining 2 ( 2 / 11 ) SARS - CoV - 2 positive tested 12 employees had no risk contacts in hospital as they were away on leave . 13 14 Fifty - six ( 0 . 8 % ) of all employees were tested as returning travelers from regions declared as 15 SARS - CoV - 2 risk regions by the RKI . As it was skiing season in Europe individuals mostly 16 returned from Austria ( n = 33 ) . As many as 18 % ( 10 / 56 ) of these individuals tested positive for 17 SARS - CoV - 2 returning from Austria ( n = 8 ) , Spain ( n = 1 ) and Switzerland ( n = 1 ) , the majority 18 ( 90 % ) of them belonging to group I with direct contact to patients . Two employees had 19 already returned back to work , when the regions they had returned from were announced 20 as SARS - CoV - 2 risk region . The hospital infection control identified 40 contact persons from 21 the hospital staff , but no transmission was detected . 22 23 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 The hospital infection control further informed employees after identifying risk contacts 1 either with SARS - CoV - 2 positive patients or with employees tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 2 in an external laboratory . For 55 SARS - CoV - 2 positive patients 163 risk contact persons were 3 identified with up to 9 risk contacts per individual . As much as 6 patient - to - employee 4 transmissions were identified . Of note , 2 transmissions occurred in contact with a patient 5 whose quarantine had been finished due to a false negative SARS - CoV - 2 result . The other 6 patient - to - employee transmissions occurred outside the COVID - 19 specialized wards . Four 7 of the 6 transmissions occurred in employees - in - training . Subsequently , 60 risk contact 8 persons were identified by the hospital infection control and one employee - to - employee 9 transmission was detected . Here , no subsequent additional risk contact persons were 10 identified . 11 Five employees tested SARS - CoV - 2 positive outside the hospital SARS - CoV - 2 testing facility 12 lead to identification of 128 risk contacts of employees and thus one employee - to - employee 13 transmission was detected . There was no further transmission in the subsequent 37 risk 14 contacts identified by the hospital infection control . 15 16 All 30 SARS - CoV - 2 positive employees tested positive in the hospital testing facility were 17 followed up and SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR remained positive for a median time of 16 . 5 days ( IQR 18 14 ; 22 ) , the maximum time of SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR being positive was 35 days . In 21 / 30 ( 70 % ) 19 SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR was still positive 14 days after first SARS - CoV - 2 detection . 20 21 Discussion : 22 In the beginning of the COVID - 19 pandemic an easily accessible public SARS - CoV - 2 testing 23 was not available . Thus , the low - threshold testing facility was introduced to provide a free 24 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 and voluntary SARS - CoV - 2 testing opportunity for the employees of the University Hospital 1 Bonn . Importantly , positive SARS - CoV - 2 test results were not linked with mandatory leave . 2 Thus , as much as 16 % of employees of the University Hospital Bonn were tested for SARS - 3 CoV - 2 infection in the observation period of 53 days . 4 Of these employees 1 % were tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . This was 10 times higher 5 compared to the cumulative incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections during this time period in 6 Bonn ( 199 / 100 , 000 ) . Importantly , 64 % of these employees had missing or mild symptoms , 7 strengthening the significance of a low - threshold SARS - CoV - 2 testing facility in a hospital 8 setting . The high prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 positive individuals with missing or mild 9 symptoms has also been shown in previous studies ( Streeck et al . , 2020 ) . 10 Working in a medical institution during times of global pandemics threatening millions of 11 lives worldwide is not only physical but also mental stress for HCW ( Ives et al . , 2009 ) . It has 12 been shown that besides professional experience also social support is desperately needed 13 to handle a pandemic situation in a medical institution ( Holmes et al . , 2020 ) . The majority 14 ( 80 % ) of the 1 , 185 employees taking advantage of the voluntary low - threshold testing 15 facility had missing or mild symptoms . Providing a test opportunity , where test results are 16 available within 24 hours not only supports HCW in fear of SARS - CoV - 2 infection 17 psychologically , but also enables HCW to return back to work more rapidly in times of critical 18 human resource planning ( Chowell and Mizumoto , 2020 ) . 19 The high percentage ( 18 % ) of employees with a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test result returning 20 from risk countries emphasizes the importance of tracking the current development of the 21 SARS - CoV - 2 infection rate not only countrywide but also region specific . Regarding the re - 22 opening of boarders and increasing geographical mobility our data suggests that testing 23 individuals returning from regions in - and outside of Germany with higher numbers of SARS - 24 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 CoV - 2 infections can prevent outbreaks in vulnerable surroundings such as medical 1 institutions . As clinical symptoms are often mild or absent in SARS - CoV - 2 positive individuals 2 epidemiological data on spread of SARS - CoV - 2 must lead decisions on screening politics . 3 The number of SARS - CoV - 2 testing has decreased over time in the testing facility in parallel 4 with the decline of the reproduction rate of SARS - CoV - 2 in Germany , which had reached R = 3 5 beginning of March and stabilizing around R = 1 since the 22nd of March ( Seedat , 2020 ) . 6 In total 3 clusters of patient - to - employee transmission appeared over the observation 7 period leading to 6 infected HCW . Identifying and screening the risk contacts of these HCW 8 led to identification of one employee - to - employee SARS - CoV - 2 infection thereby preventing 9 the further spread of this SARS - CoV - 2 cluster . Importantly , 2 of 3 clusters occurred on non - 10 COVID - 19 specialized wards emphasizing the importance of high levels of training and 11 professional experience in pandemic settings . The third cluster occurred after false 12 termination of quarantine most probably due to a poor specimen collection and thus false 13 negative SARS - CoV - 2 swab results further underlining the need for specialized training of all 14 HCW involved . Four of these 6 patient - to - employee transmissions occurred in HCW in 15 training , further stressing the necessity of professional training ( Pung et al . , 2020 ) . 16 17 One cluster occurred after an employee was tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 outside our 18 testing facility . Tracking of risk contacts and his place of employment by the hospital 19 infection control in the University Hospital , lead to identification of one employee - to - 20 employee transmission , followed by intervention measures interrupting successfully further 21 spread of infection . All cases of clusters of patient - to - employee and employee - to - employee 22 transmission highlight the great importance of a perfectly working hospital infection control 23 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 network identifying risk contacts fast and receiving SARS - CoV - 2 test results rapidly in order 1 to interrupt further spread of infection ( Rivett et al . , 2020 ; Wee et al . , 2020 ) . 2 3 Our study has limitations . Clusters of employee - to - employee and patient - to - employee 4 transmission were defined after risk contact assessment by the hospital infection control . 5 Further genomic analysis of SARS - CoV - 2 , however , was not performed to directly confirm 6 these transmission clusters . 7 8 Conclusions : 9 Incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections in employees of a hospital are shown to be higher 10 compared to the general population . Thus , offering a low - threshold SARS - CoV - 2 testing 11 facility in the absence of an easily accessible public testing facility identifies SARS - CoV - 2 12 positive employees with absent or mild clinical symptoms of infection , thereby stopping 13 further spread of infection in a vulnerable hospital environment . A perfectly working 14 hospital infection control network tracking risk contacts and high levels of professional 15 infection prevention training are important factors to prevent continuous distribution of 16 SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 17 18 Funding : 19 None . 20 21 Declaration of competing interest : 22 None to declare . 23 24 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 Figure Legend : 1 Figure 1 : Number of SARS - CoV - 2 swabs taken in the low - threshold screening facility between 2 9th March and 30th April 3 References : 4 Cai , W . , Lian , B . , Song , X . , Hou , T . , Deng , G . , Li , H . , 2020 .
