The cause of KS has been unidentiﬁed , even by whole - genome scan with array comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) . In recent years , high - resolution oligonucleotide array technologies have enabled us to detect ﬁne copy number alterations . In 17 patients with KS , molecular karyotyping was carried out with GeneChip 250K NspI array ( Affymetrix ) and Copy Number Analyser for GeneChip ( CNAG ) . It showed seven copy number alterations , three deleted regions and four duplicated regions among the patients , with the exception of registered copy number variants ( CNVs ) . Among the seven loci , only the region of 9q21 . 11 - q21 . 12 ( B 1 . 27 Mb ) involved coding genes , namely , transient receptor potential cation channel , subfamily M , member 3 ( TRPM3 ) , Kruppel - like factor 9 ( KLF9 ) , structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 5 ( SMC5 ) and MAM domain containing 2 ( MAMDC2 ) . Mutation screening for the genes detected 10 base substitutions consisting of seven single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and three silent mutations in 41 patients with KS . Our study could not show the causative genes for KS , but the locus of 9q21 . 11 - q21 . 12 , in association with a cleft palate , may contribute to the manifestation of KS in the patient . As various platforms on oligonucleotide arrays have been developed , higher resolution platforms will need to be applied to search tiny genomic rearrangements in patients with KS .

It is assumed that KS is an autosomal dominant disorder , considering the equal male - to - female ratio of patients and parent – child transmission pattern in some familial cases . 5 The cause of KS remains unknown , even though at least 400 patients have been diagnosed in a variety of ethnic groups since 1981 . 3 – 7 Some works have ruled out several loci ; for example , 1q32 – q41 , 8p22 – p23 . 1 and 22q11 , as candidates for KS . 8 – 13 A study of array - based comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) showed a disruption of the C20orf133 ( MACROD2 ) gene by B 250kb deletion in a patient with KS , 14 but the following mutation screening for the gene failed to ﬁnd a pathogenic base change within exons in 19 other patients with KS 14 and in 43 Japanese patients . 15 Another study of array CGH with 0 . 5 – 1 . 2Mb resolution reported that 2q37 deletions were detected in two patients with Kabuki - like features , but their facial features were not typical for KS . 16 To date , no concordant speciﬁc lesion has been Received 15 January 2009 ; revised 3 March 2009 ; accepted 11 March 2009 ; published online 3 April 2009 1 Department of Human Genetics , Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences , Nagasaki , Japan ; 2 Department of Pediatrics , Nagasaki University School of Medicine , Nagasaki , Japan ; 3 Division of Medical Genetics , Saitama Children’s Medical Center , Iwatsuki , Japan ; 4 Division of Medical Genetics , Kanagawa Children’s Medical Center , Yokohama , Japan ; 5 Department of Pediatrics , Tenshi Hospital , Sapporo , Japan ; 6 Department of Pediatrics , Dokkyo University School of Medicine Koshigaya Hospital , Koshigaya , Japan ; 7 Department of Planning and Research , Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child health , Osaka , Japan ; 8 Department of Pediatrics , Yamagata University School of Medicine , Yamagata , Japan ; 9 Department of Medical Genetics , Shinshu University School of Medicine , Matsumoto , Japan ; 10 Department of Medical Genetics , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan ; 11 Division of Functional Genomics , Center for Frontier Life Sciences , Nagasaki University , Nagasaki , Japan ; 12 Department of Human Genetics , Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine , Yokohama , Japan ; 13 Research Institute of Personalized Health Sciences , Health Sciences University of Hokkaido , Tobetsu , Japan and 14 Solution Oriented Research for Science and Technology ( SORST ) , Japan Science and Technology Agency ( JST ) , Tokyo , Japan Correspondence : Dr K - i Yoshiura , Department of Human Genetics , Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences , Sakamoto 1 - 12 - 4 , Nagasaki 852 - 8523 , Japan .

Herein , we report the results of molecular karyotyping in 17 patients using GeneChip 250K array and those of mutation screening of candidate genes in 41 patients with KS in Japan . MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects The subjects for molecular karyotyping consisted of 18 patients ( nine girls and nine boys ) at entry . The subjects for mutation screening consisted of 41 patients ( 20 girls and 21 boys ) , including the aforementioned 18 patients . The diagnoses of KS were conﬁrmed by experts of clinical genetics , although written permis - sion for the use of facial photographs in publications was not obtained . These Japanese patients showed a normal karyotype at a 400 - band level , and were earlier reported with no pathogenic genome copy number change by 1 . 5Mb - resolution BAC array CGH . 18 Genomic DNA was isolated by the standard method from their peripheral blood leukocytes or in part from their lympho - blastoid cell lines . Experimental procedures were approved by the Committee for the Ethical Issues on Human Genome and Gene Analysis at Nagasaki University . Molecular karyotyping DNA oligomicroarray hybridization , using the GeneChip Human Mapping 250K Nsp Array ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) , was carried out for 18 patients with KS , following the provided protocol ( Affymetrix ) . Data were analyzed using GTYPE ( GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software ) to detect copy number aberration and visualized using CNAG ( Copy Number Analyser for GeneChip ) version 3 . 21 References for non - paired analysis of CNAG were chosen from eight unrelated individuals of HapMap samples from the Affymetrix website ( http : / / www . affymetrix . com / support / ) . The resolution of this procedure was estimated as B 30 – 100kb . CNAG version 3 was linked with the University of California Santa Cruz ( UCSC ) genome browser ( http : / / genome . ucsc . edu / ) assembly May 2004 , and then its physical position was referred to the data assembly on March 2006 in the UCSC genome browser after adjustment . Validation of deletion Quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) analysis to validate deletions was run on a Light - Cycler 480 Real - Time PCR System ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) using an intercalating dye , SYTO9 ( Molecular probes , OR , USA ) , which is an alternative to SYBR green I . 22 Absolute quantiﬁcation was carried out using a second derivative max method . A standard curve of ampliﬁcation efﬁciency for each set of primers was generated with a serial dilution of genomic DNA . A corrected gene dosage was given as the ratio of a target gene divided by an internal control gene . The copy number was obtained from a calibration under the assumption that the control genome was diploid . Target genes of copy number aberration were as follows : SUMF1 ( for patient K9 ) ; MAMDC2 ( for patient K16 ) ; and CETN1 ( for patient K34 ) . The primer sequences of these genes are available in the online supplementary ﬁle . Internal control diploid genes were OAZ2 and USP21 . Primer sets of the control genes for genomic DNA were selected from the Real Time PCR Primer Sets website ( http : / / www . realtimeprimers . org / ) . The control genes were conﬁrmed to have no copy number variants on the Database of Genomic Variants ( DGV ) updated on 26 June 2008 ( http : / / projects . tcag . ca / variation / ) . BLASTsearches conﬁrmed all primer sequences speciﬁc for the gene . Samples were analyzed in triplicate in a 384 - well format in a 10 m l ﬁnal volume containing about 2ng genomic DNA , 0 . 5 m M forward primer , 0 . 5 m M reverse primer , 0 . 1 Units TaKaRa ExTaq HS version ( TaKaRa , Kyoto , Japan ) , 1 (cid:1) PCR buffer , 200 m M dNTP and 0 . 5 m M SYTO9 . The ampliﬁcation conditions consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 1 C for 5min , followed by 45 cycles of Table 1 Detected genomic copy number aberrations in 17 patients with Kabuki syndrome Cytoband Patient ( s ) ID CN State Length Physical position Involving gene ( s ) Concordant loss / gain on DGV Start End 3p26 . 3 K7 1 460kb 1435279 1895554 NR Variation _ 8235 3p26 . 2 K9 1 a 205kb 4009368 4214847 SUMF1 Variation _ 8973 , 8975 , 30169 4q13 . 2 K23 1 a 1 . 26Mb 66329014 67591611 NR NR 5q21 . 2 - q21 . 3 K22 1 281kb 104301325 104581898 NR Variation _ 3568 9q21 . 11 - q21 . 12 K16 1 a 1 . 27Mb 71760296 73031176 TRPM3 , KLF9 , SMC5 , MAMDC2 NR 14q11 . 2 K5 1 166 kb 19336854 19502641 OR4N2 , OR4K2 , OR4K5 , OR4K1 Variation _ 0376 , 7028 , 8094 , 9234 , 9235 15q11 . 2 K1 , K23 1 972kb 19356830 20329239 OR4M2 , OR4N4 , LOC65D137 Variation _ 0318 , 3070 , 8265 , 9251 , 9254 , 9256 18p11 . 32 K34 1 a 35kb 545074 580003 CETN1 Variation _ 5044 20p12 . 1 K6 1 a 152kb 14993412 15145890 C20orf133 ( MACROD2 ) b NR 4q12 K5 3 104kb 54251599 54355281 NR NR 8q11 . 21 K7 3 171kb 50641101 50812548 NR Variation _ 2751 , 3731 , 8601 , 37765 10p15 . 2 - p15 . 1 K5 3 142kb 3663600 3805292 NR NR 13q31 . 1 K6 3 72kb 82451568 82523728 NR NR 15q11 . 2 K7 , K9 , K12 3 877kb 19112164 19989036 CXADRP2 , POTEB Variation _ 3070 , 3951 , 8784 , 30670 , etc . 15q25 . 1 K9 3 165kb 76992181 77156751 CTSH , RASGRF1 Variation _ 3970 , 7073 16q21 K13 3 283kb 58508008 58791285 NR NR 17q12 K7 3 495kb 31428390 31923810 CCL3 , CCL4 , CCL3L1 , CCL3L3 , CCL4L1 , CCL4L2 , TBC1D3B , TBC1D3C , TBC1D3G Variation _ 3142 , 4031 , 8841 , 30824 , etc . 22q11 . 22 K5 , K12 3 278kb 20907806 21186081 VPREB1 , ZNF280B Variation _ 5356 , 34540 Abbreviations : CN , copy number ; DGV , Database of Genomic Variants ; NR , no registration in UCSC genes or DGV . a Validated by quantitative PCR . b Deleted region was within intron 5 of the C20orf133 ( MACROD2 ) and did not involve any coding exon . 15 Molecular karyotyping in Kabuki syndrome H Kuniba et al 305 Journal of Human Genetics denaturation at 95 1 C for 10s , annealing at 55 1 C for 10s and extension at 72 1 C for 15s The data were analyzed using LightCycler 480 Basic Software ( Roche Diagnostics ) and the melting curve was checked to eliminate non - speciﬁc products from the reaction . Mutation screening of candidate genes Candidate genes , identiﬁed within a detected deletion , consisted of four genes : TRPM3 ( NM _ 001007471 and NM _ 206946 ) , KLF9 ( NM _ 001206 ) , SMC5 ( NM _ 015110 ) and MAMDC2 ( NM _ 153267 ) located at 9q21 . 12 – q21 . 11 . The entire coding region and splice junctions of the genes were sequenced on an automated sequencer 3130xl ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) using BigDye version 3 . 1 ( Applied Biosystems ) . Genomic sequences were retrieved from the UCSC genome browser ( assembly : March 2006 ) . PCR primers were designed with the assistance of Primer3 ( http : / / frodo . wi . mit . edu / cgi - bin / primer3 / primer3 . cgi ) . The primer sequences are available in the online supplementary ﬁle . Resultant electropherograms were aligned using ATGC version 3 . 0 ( Software Development , Tokyo , Japan ) and inspected visually to ﬁnd DNA alterations . In silico analysis Relations among deleted genes were assessed using online software , PANTHER ( Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships , http : / / www . pantherdb . org ) , to determine whether the genes involve some developmental pathway or biological process . 23 The novel synonymous base substitutions found in the mutation screening were examined for their potential activation of the cryptic splice site by comparison between wild - type allele and mutated allele using the GeneSplicer program ( http : / / www . cbcb . umd . edu / software / GeneSplicer / gene _ spl . shtml ) .

Molecular karyotyping in Kabuki syndrome H Kuniba et al 306 Journal of Human Genetics RESULTS Molecular karyotyping and validation of deletion The entries of molecular karyotyping were 18 patients with KS ( K1 , K3 , K5 , K6 , K7 , K8 , K9 , K11 , K12 , K13 , K16 , K18 , K20 , K21 , K22 , K23 , K34 and K38 ) . We eliminated the data of patient K3 from copy number analysis , because it showed low quality data ; that is , a single - nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) call rate of 82 . 51 % and a quality control performance detection rate of 74 . 09 % , probably because of DNA degradation during long - term storage . The other patients showed high call rates , enough for copy number analysis ( SNP call rate of 90 . 07 – 97 . 72 % and detection rate of 91 . 52 – 99 . 77 % ) . We identiﬁed nine deleted regions , the lengths of which were between B 35kb and B 1 . 27Mb , and nine duplicated regions , of lengths between B 72 and B 495kb , in the 17 patients analyzed ( Table 1 ) . As for the nine duplications detected , ﬁve of them were concordant to several observed gains in DGV , and four of them in each patient did not contain any known genes . It is interesting that the deleted region of 9q21 . 11 – q21 . 12 ( B 1 . 27Mb in patient K16 ) , which had not been registered in DGV , harbored four known genes : transient receptor potential cation channel , subfamily M , member 3 ( TRPM3 ) , Kruppel - like factor 9 ( KLF9 ) , structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 5 ( SMC5 ) and MAM domain containing 2 ( MAMDC2 ) ( Figure 1d ) . The dele - tion of 3p26 . 2 ( B 205kb in patient K9 , Figure 1a ) had involved a non - coding exon of the SUMF1 gene . The deletion of 18p11 . 32 ( B 35kb in patient K34 , Figure 1b ) containing the CETN1 gene had one registra - tion in DGV as Variation _ 5044 , which described only one observed loss and 14 observed gains in 95 individuals . The deletion of 4q13 . 2 ( B 1 . 26Mb in patient K23 , Figure 1c ) and 20p12 . 1 ( B 152kb in patient K6 ) did not carry any coding exon of any gene . The regions of 14q11 . 2 ( B 116kb in patient K5 ) and 15q11 . 2 ( B 972kb in patient K1 and K23 ) were non - pathological deletions with as many registrations as observed losses in DGV . To validate the deletion of the detected region , we conﬁrmed the loss of heterozygosities of the SNP probes present there using GTYPE ( data not shown ) and carried out qPCR . The regions of SUMF1 on 3p26 . 2 ( for patient K9 ) and of MAMDC2 on 9q21 . 11 – q21 . 12 ( for patient K16 ) had one copy in each patient compared with those in unaffected individuals ( Figure 2 ) . The deletion of CETN1 on 18p11 . 32 ( for patient K34 ) was inherited from his unaffected mother . As samples from the parents of patient K16 were unavailable , it was not possible to examine whether the deletion of 9q21 was de novo . But the deletion was not found in 95 normal Japanese individuals using qPCR ( data not shown ) . As a consequence of this copy number analysis , we considered the next four genes as candidate genes for KS : TRPM3 , KLF9 , SMC5 and MAMDC2 . Mutation screening and in silico analysis Table 2 shows the results from mutation screening of the four candidate genes in 41 patients with KS . Ten base substitutions were found in the 41 patients , consisting of six registered SNPs , one unregistered SNP and three silent mutations . In addition , SUMF1 ( NM _ 182760 ) and CETN1 ( NM _ 004066 ) were also screened , but no mutations were detected ( data not shown ) . We checked the three silent mutations for splice site alteration using the GeneSplicer program , but no activation of the cryptic splice site was predicted . Although PANTHER classiﬁcation of the four candidate genes did not show signiﬁcant correlation for biological processes or pathway because of its small scale in number , some genes associated with developmental biology ; that is , DNA repair ( SMC5 ) and mRNA transcription regulation ( KLF9 ) . DISCUSSION We used high - resolution oligonucleotide array of GeneChip 250K NspI with a resolution of 30 – 100kb and tried to ﬁnd causative deletions or mutated genes for KS . Our molecular analysis did not strongly identify the causative gene for KS , but we identiﬁed a locus that possibly contributed to KS . The deletion in patient K16 , with a length of B 1 . 27Mb at 9q21 . 11 – q21 . 12 , harbored four known genes : TRPM3 , KLF9 , SMC5 and MAMDC2 ( Figure 1d ) . Unfortunately , her parents’ DNAs were unavailable , but the region is unlikely to be a copy number variant ( CNV ) because it has not been known as CNV in DGV ; moreover , the deletion was not found in 95 normal Japanese individuals using qPCR . As mutation screening in the 41 patients with KS showed no pathogenic base substitution in these genes , we cannot state that Figure 2 Validation of deletion with quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) . qPCR conﬁrmed a loss of one copy in each patient : SUMF1 at 3p26 . 2 for patient K9 ; MAMDC2 at 9q21 . 1 for patient K16 ; CETN1 at 18p11 . 32 for patient K34 . The deletion of patient K34 was inherited from his unaffected mother . UA , unaffected individual . Error bars , s . d . Molecular karyotyping in Kabuki syndrome H Kuniba et al 307 Journal of Human Genetics these genes are major genetic factors for KS . However , it is presumable that the genes have some etiological roles for KS because of its genetic heterogeneity . Ontology of the PANTHER classiﬁcation suggested that the three genes were associated with developmental biology , such as mRNA transcription regulation . Moreover , the 1 . 27Mb region of 9q21 was included in an earlier reported candidate locus of cleft lip / palate by meta - analysis of linkage analysis . 24 Patient K16 actually had velopharyngeal insufﬁciency because of a submucous cleft palate . Therefore , it is reasonable to consider that the deleted genes coop - erated with the development of a cleft palate , which is often accom - panied by KS . Although the B 152kb deletion within intron 5 of C20orf133 ( MACROD2 ) in patient K6 did not involve any coding exon and her parents’ DNAs were unavailable , the deletion was neither regis - tered as CNV in DGV nor was it found in 95 normal Japanese individuals by qPCR ( data not shown ) . Maas et al . 14 reported de novo B 250kb deletion , including exon 5 of C20orf133 ( MACROD2 ) , in a patient with KS . Direct sequencing for the gene in 62 other patients with KS did not detect mutations , 14 , 15 but the gene may be one of the causative genes for KS in consideration of its genetic heterogeneity . We focused this study on KS on deletion / duplication detected using oligonucleotide array and mutation screening of the coding genes within the region . One limitation of this study is its resolution . As a matter of course , a higher resolution array can detect smaller genomic rearrangements , which were undetectable in the same patient , as we showed here compared with an earlier study of BAC array CGH . 18 Although SNP probes are useful to examine loss of heterozygosity as a collateral evidence in deletions , unevenly distributed probes of the SNP array have a disadvantage for CNV detection . As various plat - forms on oligonucleotide array have developed , higher resolution platforms will have to be applied to search tiny genomic rearrange - ments in patients with KS . Another limitation is that we assumed that a single copy number change caused KS . It remains to be elucidated whether CNV association 25 contributes towards manifestations of KS . If further investigation with reﬁned array technologies cannot ﬁnd the etiology of KS , the direction of study for KS will have to be changed to ﬁnd de novo sequence alteration or methylation aberration , including in the non - coding genomic regions . In summary , we applied molecular karyotyping with GeneChip 250K array to detect copy number aberrations in 17 patients with KS and screened four candidate genes in 41 patients with KS . We could not identify causative DNA alteration for KS , but the locus , 9q21 . 11 - q21 . 12 , including TRPM3 , KLF9 , SMC5 and MAMDC2 , may con - tribute to the cleft palate of KS . Further investigations will be needed as various array platforms have the potential to specify genomic alterations for KS .
