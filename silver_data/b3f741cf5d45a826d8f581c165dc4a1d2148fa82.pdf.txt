To expedite investigation of targeted NPs , we engineered human cancer cells to express chimeric receptors that bind polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) and internalize stealth NPs in a fashion similar to ligand - targeted liposomes against epidermal growth factor receptor 1 or 2 ( HER1 or HER2 ) , which are validated targets for cancer therapy . Measurement of the rate of endocytosis and lysosomal accumulation of small ( 80 − 94 nm ) or large ( 180 − 220 nm ) ﬂ exible liposomes or more rigid lipid - coated mesoporous silica particles in human HT29 colon cancer and SKBR3 breast cancer cells that express chimeric receptors revealed that larger and more rigid NPs were internalized more slowly than smaller and more ﬂ exible NPs . An exception is when both the small and large liposomes underwent endocytosis via HER2 . HER1 mediated faster and greater uptake of NPs into cells but retained NPs less well as compared to HER2 . Lysosomal accumulation of NPs internalized via HER1 was una ﬀ ected by NP rigidity but was inversely related to NP size , whereas large rigid NPs internalized by HER2 displayed increased lysosomal accumulation . Our results provide insight into the e ﬀ ects of NP properties on receptor - mediated endocytosis and suggest that anti - PEG chimeric receptors may help accelerate investigation of targeted stealth NPs . KEYWORDS : PEGylated liposomes , immunoliposomes , α PEG antibody , polyethylene glycol , HER1 , HER2 , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , caveolin , stealth NPs N anoparticles ( NPs ) are increasingly under investiga - tion for delivering therapeutic agents to tumors . NP accumulation in tumors is controlled by the enhanced permeability and retention ( EPR ) e ﬀ ect in which nanosized particles can pass through leaky blood vessels and accumulate in the tumor interstitial space . 1 Most therapeutic agents , however , must enter individual cancer cells to reach their appropriate molecular target for e ﬀ ective anticancer activity . Attachment of ligands on the surface of NPs can increase interactions with speci ﬁ c cellular receptors and promote receptor - mediated endocytosis of the NPs ( Figure 1A ) , thereby increasing cellular uptake of the therapeutic cargo with concomitant enhancement of antitumor activity . 2 − 6 NP e ﬃ cacy can be greatly a ﬀ ected by the rate of cellular uptake and the intracellular fate of the nanocargos . Thus , many studies have investigated the cellular uptake of nontargeted NPs . 7 − 10 By contrast , the relationship between NP physi - ochemical properties , cellular uptake , and intracellular routing is less well understood for ligand - targeted NPs . It is clear , however , that NP properties such as size and shape can greatly alter the receptor - mediated endocytosis and cellular response of ligand - targeted NPs . 9 , 11 Therefore , it is important to under - Received : September 9 , 2015 Accepted : January 7 , 2016 Published : January 7 , 2016 A r t i c l e www . acsnano . org © 2016 American Chemical Society 648 DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 5b05661 ACS Nano 2016 , 10 , 648 − 662 stand how NP properties a ﬀ ect the uptake , routing , and therapeutic activity of targeted nanocarriers . An important obstacle to the systematic investigation of targeted NPs is the increased level of complexity involved in their production . It can be time - consuming and expensive to generate a panel of targeted NPs , which involves preparation and puri ﬁ cation of a targeting ligand such as a monoclonal antibody fragment , chemical conjugation of the ligand to the NPs , and subsequent validation that NP and ligand properties and activities were not deleteriously altered . Moreover , it is di ﬃ cult to ensure that all NPs possess similar densities and activities of the targeting ligand , which could alter their binding a ﬃ nity 12 and rate of internalization . 13 These issues have hindered the careful comparison of di ﬀ erent NPs targeting the same receptor . Here we investigated an alternative approach to advance the investigation and development of targeted NPs by diminishing reliance on ligand preparation and surface conjugation of NPs . Cancer cells were developed that stably express chimeric receptors that can directly bind to unliganded NPs , yet act as cellular receptors for uptake and intracellular routing of the NPs ( Figure 1B ) . The receptors were composed of two parts : an extracellular domain that can bind to NPs ( anti - PEG Fab ) and a truncated cellular receptor that directs the endocytosis of the NPs into cancer cells ( Figure 1C ) . 14 We predicted that the engineered receptors could bind untargeted NPs and induce receptor - mediated uptake into cancer cells in a fashion that recapitulates ligand - targeted NPs that bind to the correspond - ing natural receptor on the cells . Successful creation of cell lines that express chimeric receptors might then allow systematic development , comparison , and investigation of targeted NPs without the need to covalently attach targeting ligands to the NPs . We choose to use antibody fragments that can bind to polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) for the NP binding domain of the chimeric receptors . PEG is a nontoxic and non - antigenic biocompatible polymer that is often used to create “ stealth ” NPs that display decreased uptake by macrophages in the liver and enhanced uptake into the tumor interstitial space by the EPR e ﬀ ect . 15 − 17 The common use of PEG in NP fabrication makes this a useful handle for NP recognition by the chimeric receptors . HER1 and HER2 were selected in our study as the other half of the chimeric receptors . These membrane receptors are overexpressed in several tumor types and are clinical targets for both drug and antibody therapy . 18 − 25 Several NPs that target HER1 or HER2 are also undergoing clinical trials such as MM - 302 , an immunoliposome that binds to HER2 , and C225 - ILsS - DOX , an immunoliposome that binds to HER1 . 26 , 27 Chimeric receptors constructed from HER1 and HER2 are therefore relevant for investigation of targeted NPs . In the present study , we sought to ( 1 ) engineer and express chimeric receptors that could bind stealth NPs on cancer cells , Figure 1 .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Surface Expression of Functional HER1 and HER2 Chimeric Receptors . Chimeric HER1 and HER2 receptors were constructed by fusing an anti - PEG Fab fragment to truncated HER1 or HER2 receptors ( Figure 1C ) . The anti - PEG Fab is designed to bind to stealth NPs , whereas the HER1 and HER2 portions of the receptors are included to trigger receptor - mediated endocytosis of the NPs . HT29 colon cancer cells that stably express chimeric HER1 receptors ( α PEG - H1 / HT29 ) and SKBR3 breast cancer cells that express chimeric HER1 or HER2 receptors ( α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 and α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells , respectively ) were generated by retroviral transduction of the chimeric receptor genes and drug selection of stable cell lines . Expression of the chimeric receptors on cells was ﬁ rst evaluated by confocal microscopy using an antibody to detect the HA epitope tag present at the amino - terminus of the receptors . Confocal imaging demonstrated membrane expres - sion of α PEG - H1 or α PEG - H2 receptors on engineered SKBR3 and HT29 cell lines ( Figure 2A ) . Quanti ﬁ cation of the levels of the chimeric receptors on the cell lines as determined by ﬂ uorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) showed that high levels of α PEG - H1 were present on α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 cells and α PEG - H1 / HT29 cells , and slightly lower levels of α PEG - H2 were present on α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells ( Figure 2B ) . Confocal imaging showed that PEGylated liposomes labeled with the ﬂ uorescent dye DiIC18 ( 5 ) bound to the surface of α PEG - H1 / HT29 , α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 , and α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells but not to the parental cells ( Figure 2C ) . The ﬂ uorescent dye was stably retained in liposomes for at least 5 h in culture medium containing serum ( Figure S1 ) . Chimeric Receptors Can Mediate NP Endocytosis . To investigate if the chimeric receptors could mimic the cellular behavior of targeted liposomes , we ﬁ rst made immunolipo - somes that can target HER1 or HER2 on cancer cells ( Figure 3A ) . Single - chain antibodies ( scFv ) against HER1 and HER2 were generated with a C - terminal His - tag for a ﬃ nity puri ﬁ cation and a cysteine residue for covalent attachment to Figure 2 . Chimeric receptors expressed on cancer cells can bind stealth liposomes . ( A ) Parental SKBR3 and HT29 cells , HT29 cells engineered to express chimeric α PEG - HER1 receptors ( α PEG - H1 / HT29 cells ) , or SKBR3 cells engineered to express chimeric α PEG - HER1 or α PEG - HER2 receptors ( α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 and α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells , respectively ) on glass slides at 4 ° C were immuno ﬂ uorescence stained ( green ) for the HA epitope tag on the chimeric receptors .

SDS - PAGE analysis of puri ﬁ ed scFv demonstrated major bands with the expected molecular weights of approximately 25 kDa ( Figure 3B ) . The scFv appeared to be monomers under reducing conditions ( Figure 3C , left panel ) but formed dimers under nonreducing conditions ( Figure 3C , right panel ) , consistent with the presence of the C - terminal cysteine group .

Puri ﬁ ed scFv was reacted with liposomes that incorporated lipid − PEG − maleimide molecules to generate immunoliposomes ( α H1 - IL or α H2 - IL ) that can bind to HER1 or HER2 , respectively . SDS - PAGE followed by Western blotting demonstrated a shift in scFv size in α H1 - IL and α H2 - IL , corresponding to covalent attachment to lipid − PEG − maleimide molecules ( Figure 3C ) . To verify functional binding of the ILs , we incubated nontargeted stealth liposomes with α PEG - H1 / HT29 , α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 , and α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells , whereas α H1 - IL or α H2 - IL immunoliposomes were incubated with parental SKBR3 and HT29 cancer cells . HT29 cells express HER1 , whereas SKBR2 cells express both HER1 and HER2 ( Figure S2 ) . 28 FACS analysis of liposome ﬂ uorescence on the cells revealed comparable binding of stealth liposomes to cells expressing HER1 or HER2 chimeric receptors and targeted immunoliposomes binding to the parental cells ( Figure 3D ) . For example , PEGylated liposome binding to α PEG - H1 / HT29 cells was not signi ﬁ cantly di ﬀ erent from the binding of α H1 - IL immunoliposomes to HT29 cells . As expected , the untargeted stealth liposomes bound poorly to parental HT29 and SKBR3 cells . We conclude that the chimeric receptors expressed on HT29 and SKBR3 cells could bind PEGylated liposomes at levels that were comparable to the binding of targeted immunoliposomes to their corresponding receptors on HT29 and SKBR3 cells . We next sought to test if chimeric HER1 and HER2 receptors could mediate the endocytosis of NPs into cancer cells in a qualitatively similar fashion as the corresponding endogenous membrane receptors . Liposomes labeled with DiIC18 ( 5 ) were incubated for 2 h at 37 ° C with α PEG - H1 / HT29 and parental HT29 cells previously treated with LysoTracker Red DND99 to visualize lysosomes . Overlap of green and red signals to produce yellow indicates colocalization of liposomes ( green ) and lysosomes ( red ) as visualized under a confocal microscope . We observed a similar pattern of liposomes accumulating in the lysosomal compartment for Figure 4 .

Quanti ﬁ cation of lysosomal accumulation of the NPs in lysosomes showed no signi ﬁ cant di ﬀ erence of PEG - liposomes in α PEG - H1 / HT29 cells ( 40 . 8 % of liposomes colocalized to lysosomes ) as compared to α H1 - IL in HT29 cells ( 38 . 8 % of liposomes colocalized to lysosomes ) ( Figure 4D ) . Ligand binding to HER1 can stimulate clathrin - mediated endocytosis and routing to the lysosomal compartment of cells . 29 The AP2 adaptor complex and EGFR pathway substrate 15 ( Eps15 ) are important for HER1 - mediated endocytosis . 30 , 31 The AP2 adaptor complex is a heterotetrameric protein complex that interacts with membrane receptors and clathrin to form clathrin - coated vesicles . 32 , 33 Eps15 is constitutively associated with AP2 and is involved in formation of clathrin - coated vesicles and the endocytosis of HER1 . 34 We therefore treated HT29 and α PEG - H1 / HT29 cells with AP2 or Eps15 shRNA to knock down the expression of these molecules and impede HER1 - mediated endocytosis . HT29 cells treated with AP2 or Eps15 shRNA displayed reduced internalization of α H1 - IL ( Figure 4B , C , left panels ) and signi ﬁ cantly less colocalization with lysosomal markers ( Figure 4D ) as compared to parental HT29 cells ( 6 . 3 and 3 . 6 % for AP2 and Eps15 shRNA - treated cells versus 40 . 8 % for untreated cells ) , consistent with reduced HER1 - mediated endocytosis of the ligand - targeted liposomes . shRNA treatment also decreased the uptake of PEG - liposomes into α PEG - H1 / HT29 cells ( Figure 4B , C , right panels ) and signi ﬁ cantly reduced lysosome localization as compared with the same cells without shRNA treatment ( Figure 4D ) ( 8 . 8 and 5 . 3 % for AP2 and Eps15 shRNA - treated cells versus 38 . 8 % for untreated cells ) . These results indicate that chimeric HER1 receptors can mediate the endocytosis of untargeted stealth NPs in a qualitatively similar fashion as immunoliposomes targeted to HER1 in HT29 cells . Ligand density on NPs can in ﬂ uence factors such as cell binding , uptake kinetics , and internalization e ﬃ ciency . 35 , 36 Liposomes containing 2 , 5 , or 10 % PEG − lipid ( PEG − lipid / lipid , wt / wt ) were prepared with similar ﬂ uorescent dye loading Figure 5 .

ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 5b05661 ACS Nano 2016 , 10 , 648 − 662 653 ( Figure S3A ) to investigate the in ﬂ uence of PEG density on liposome internalization . The uptake of the liposomes , measured as internalized ﬂ uorescence in α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 cells , was inversely related to PEG density on the liposomes with about 30 % less uptake observed for liposomes coated with 10 % PEG as compared to 2 % PEG ( Figure S3B ) . The reduced uptake appeared to be primarily related to lower binding of PEGylated liposomes containing high densities of PEG ( Figure S3C ) . We also compared the endocytosis of liposomes into cells via chimeric HER2 receptor or endogenous HER2 on SKBR3 cells . Two hours after addition of liposomes to cells , only low levels ( 16 . 9 % ) of α H2 - IL colocalized with lysosomal markers in SKBR3 cells , similar to the levels of PEGylated liposomes that colocalized to the lysosomes ( 15 . 5 % ) in α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells ( Figure 5A , D ) . These results are consistent with previous studies showing that 20 % of anti - HER2 antibody - conjugated NPs colocalized to lysosomes in SKBR3 and TD47 cells . 37 HER2 - mediated endocytosis is believed to proceed via caveolae , which do not rely on AP2 or Eps15 . Thus , α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells treated with AP2 shRNA or Eps15 shRNA did not display large alterations in cellular uptake or lysosomal localization of PEGylated liposomes ( Figure 5B − D ) as compared with untreated α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells ( 9 . 3 and 13 . 4 % for AP2 or Eps15 shRNA - treated cells versus 15 . 5 % for untreated cells ) . Importantly , there was no signi ﬁ cant di ﬀ er - ences between the lysosomal accumulation of α H2 - IL in SKBR3 cells and PEG - liposomes in α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells under comparable conditions ( Figure 5D ) ( 8 . 1 and 11 . 7 % for AP2 or Eps15 shRNA - treated SKBR3 cells versus 9 . 3 and 13 . 4 % for AP2 or Eps15 shRNA - treated α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells ) . Collectively , our data indicate that HER1 and HER2 chimeric receptors mediated similar patterns of endocytosis as the corresponding endogenous receptors . Cellular Uptake via HER1 and HER2 Di ﬀ erentially Depends on the Size and Rigidity of NPs . We used cells that stably express HER1 and HER2 chimeric receptors to investigate how selected NP properties a ﬀ ect their cellular uptake and routing . PEGylated NPs were ﬁ rst prepared with di ﬀ erent sizes and rigidities . Liposomes ( more ﬂ exible ) and lipid - coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( MSN ) ( more rigid ; L - MSN ) with smaller or larger sizes were labeled with ﬂ uorescent DiIC18 ( 5 ) dye . DiIC18 ( 5 ) , which is a lipophilic dye , was stably retained in liposomes and lipid - coated MSN for at least 5 h ( Figure S1 ) , indicating good NP stability and ﬂ uorescent dye retention . The average sizes of the PEGylated liposomes as measured by dynamic light scattering were 81 ± 2 nm ( small ) and 185 ± 2 nm ( large ) , whereas the average size of the L - MSN were 94 ± 4 nm ( small ) and 220 ± 14 nm ( large ) ( Figure 6A ) . PEG coating of the NPs was assessed by ELISA using anti - PEG antibodies for the capture and detection of the PEGylated NPs . 38 Based on equal concentrations of lipids added to the assay , we veri ﬁ ed that PEG was present on each type of NP ( Figure 6B ) . The amount of PEG on the liposomes was similar to the PEG density found on Doxisome , a commercial liposomal doxorubicin formulation . PEG levels on the L - MSN appeared to be slightly greater than on liposomes , likely due to sterically restricted enhanced display of PEG molecules on the outside face of the lipid bilayer in L - MSN . The uptake of the PEGylated NPs into SKBR3 breast cancer cells that express HER1 and HER2 chimeric receptors was determined by incubating α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 or α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells with the various NPs for di ﬀ erent times ( 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 h ) at 37 ° C . The total lipid added to the cells was maintained constant at 5 μ g / mL . The NPs remaining on the surface of the cells at each time point were removed by washing the cells with an acidic solution ( Figure S4 ) as previously described 39 and then measuring the remaining ﬂ uorescence representing the internalized NPs . Here we used SKBR3 cells for all studies to eliminate confounding di ﬀ erences between cell types . Results were normalized to the ﬂ uorescence at time zero to account for di ﬀ erences in α PEG - H1 and α PEG - H2 receptor numbers . For example , 200 % relative uptake means that the number of internalized NPs at that time exceeded by 2 - fold the number of NPs that initially bound to the cells . The results show mean values from two independent experiments , each performed in triplicate . Endocytosis of small liposomes and small L - MSN into α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 cells rapidly increased to a maximum of about 360 and 250 % relative uptake , respectively , at 2 h but then decreased and became stable at about 200 % relative uptake after 4 − 6 h incubation , suggesting recycling of some NPs out of the cells ( Figure 7A ) . Consistent with our observations , HER1 receptors have been reported to possess a relatively low endocytic capacity , so that this pathway is easily saturated and can undergo a recycling process . 40 − 42 The large liposomes and large L - MSN were retained better than the small NPs , but their maximal uptake was signi ﬁ cantly lower ( p ≤ 0 . 005 ) than the corresponding small NPs ( 239 ± 13 % versus 359 ± 17 % for large and small liposomes and 142 ± 7 % versus 253 ± 15 % for large and small L - MSN , respectively ) . In particular , the large L - MSN were taken up poorly via HER1 - Figure 6 . Characterization of size and PEG coating on NPs .

In accord with our observations , the cellular uptake and exocytosis of transferrin - coated NPs , which also proceeds via a clathrin - dependent process , also depended on size with larger transferrin - coated gold NPs ( 100 nm ) , displaying about 2 - fold slower exocytosis as compared to smaller transferrin - coated gold NPs ( 50 nm ) . 7 , 8 The mecha - nism for the di ﬀ erential size discrimination between HER1 endocytosis and recycling pathways remains to be determined but might be important for e ﬀ ective retention of targeted nanocargos in cancer cells . Proteins can adsorb on NPs to form a “ protein corona ” that can alter cellular interactions and particle internalization . The degree of protein adsorption to NPs depends on many properties including the size , hardness , and degree of PEGylation . 43 − 45 We therefore measured the relative uptake of small and large liposomes and L - MSN into α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 cells in culture medium with or without serum . We observed slightly greater internalization of all NPs in the presence of serum as compared to serum - free medium , although the di ﬀ erence was not statistically signi ﬁ cant ( Figure S5 ) . These results suggest that protein adsorption to NPs did not signi ﬁ cantly alter the internalization of the NPs via chimeric HER1 receptors on SKBR3 cells , consistent with previous studies demonstrating reduced protein adsorption to PEGylated NPs . 45 HER2 - mediated cellular uptake of PEGylated NPs in α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells was substantially di ﬀ erent than the uptake observed in α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 cells . First , maximum uptake of NPs reached only about 120 % relative uptake as compared to up to 360 % in α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 cells ( Figure 7B ) . Second , both small and large ﬂ exible liposomes underwent endocytosis to similar degrees and with similar kinetics . Third , both small and large liposomes were well retained in the cells . Finally , the rigid L - MSN were poorly internalized with almost no uptake observed for the large L - MSN . Internalization of cargos by HER2 receptors is mediated by caveolae - dependent endocy - tosis . 46 The size of the caveolae - coated pits are ∼ 50 nm , 47 which may greatly hinder internalization of larger rigid NPs . Interestingly , large liposomes were internalized as well as small liposomes , suggesting that ﬂ exible NPs are preferred for e ﬀ ective uptake of targeted nanocargos via HER2 . More ﬂ exible NPs may also display enhanced circulation and targeting compared to harder NPs in vivo . 48 Comparison of HER1 - Mediated Internalization by Chimeric Receptors and Antibody - Targeted NPs . We sought to further verify that SKBR3 cells engineered to express chimeric receptors could recapitulate internalization of anti - body - targeted NPs by ﬁ rst covalently attaching anti - HER1 scFv to small and large liposomes and lipid - coated MSN . We then measured the intracellular uptake of the targeted NPs into SKBR3 cells using the identical protocol employed to measure the uptake of PEGylated NPs into α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 cells . Comparison of the uptake of the targeted NPs into SKBR3 cells with the previously determined endocytosis of PEGylated NPs into α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 cells ( from Figure 7A ) demonstrated qualitatively similar dependence on NP size and rigidity ( Figure 8 ) . For example , internalization of small α H1 - IL and α H1 - L - MSN into SKBR3 cells rapidly increased to a maximum of about 330 and 230 % as compared to small liposomes ( 360 % ) and small L - MSN ( 250 % ) in α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 cells ( Figure 8A , C ) . Collectively , these results show that HER1 chimeric receptors can mimic the cellular uptake of anti - HER1 antibody - targeted NPs . E ﬀ ect of NP Size and Rigidity on Lysosomal Accumulation . We further examined the e ﬀ ect of NP properties on cellular routing to lysosomes . Colocalization of NPs and lysosomes was measured by incubating α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 or α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells with ﬂ uorescent - labeled PEGylated NPs for 2 h and then measuring the yellow colocalization of the ﬂ uorescence from the NPs ( green ) with the ﬂ uorescence of a lysosomal marker ( red ) . The cellular location of the small or large liposomes and L - MSN was observed by confocal microscopy ( Figure 9A ) . The relative intracellular uptake of the various NPs into α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 cells after 2 h was similar to that previously observed ( Figure 9B ) . Quanti ﬁ cation of lysosomal colocalization showed that more than 50 % of the small liposomes and small L - MSN were present in lysosomes after 2 h ( Figure 9C ) . By contrast , accumulation of the large NPs in lysosomes was signi ﬁ cantly lower ( ∼ 40 % ) at 2 h . These di ﬀ erences in lysosomal accumulation are unlikely due to di ﬀ erences in the rate of endocytosis since all NPs reached their maximum intracellular accumulation at about 2 h ( Figure 7A ) . The cellular routing of liposomes and L - MSN to lysosomes in α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells was also observed by confocal microscopy ( Figure 10A ) . The relative uptake of the di ﬀ erent NPs into α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells after 2 h was similar to previously determined values ( Figure 10B ) . Relatively fewer small and large liposomes accumulated in lysosomes at 2 h as compared to the HER1 pathway ( 20 % vs 45 − 60 % of total NPs ) , but rigid L - MSN was more e ﬃ ciently transported to lysosomes , especially the large L - MSN , which reached 51 % accumulation in lysosomes ( Figure 10C ) . Thus , more rigid NPs Figure 7 . Cellular uptake of NPs depends on both NP properties and the targeted receptor . Fluorescent - labeled NPs were incubated with α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 ( A ) or α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 ( B ) cells at 37 ° C for the indicated times before surface NPs were removed by an acid wash , and the remaining intracellular NPs were measured by FACS as described in the Methods section . The results are presented as the intracellular ﬂ uorescence at each time normalized to the initial surface ﬂ uorescence intensity at time zero . The experiment was repeated twice with three replicates each time , and the results show the mean values of all six replicates ± SD .

Cellular Cytotoxicity of Doxisome Depends on the Route of Internalization . Our results indicate that ﬂ exible liposomes are more rapidly internalized by HER1 as compared by HER2 . We therefore performed a simple experiment to determine whether targeting PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin ( Doxisome ) to α PEG - H1 or α PEG - H2 chimeric receptors would produce di ﬀ erential inhibition of SKBR3 breast cancer cell proliferation . SKBR3 , α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 , and α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells were incubated with di ﬀ erent concentrations of Doxisome for 2 or 6 h . The cells were then washed , and cell proliferation was measured 2 days later . Doxisome signi ﬁ cantly inhibited the proliferation of α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 cells as compared to either SKBR3 or α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells after both 2 h ( Figure 11A ) and 6 h ( Figure 11B ) , consistent with greater uptake of liposomes via HER1 . These results suggest that HER1 may be a good candidate to target liposomal doxorubicin for cancer therapy . CONCLUSIONS Ligand - targeted NPs are highly attractive for selective delivery of nanocargos to speci ﬁ c cellular targets . The therapeutic e ﬃ cacy of targeted NPs depends on many factors including NP properties , targeting ligand , and cell type . Here we investigated a platform technology that may assist in the rational development of targeted stealth NPs . Chimeric receptors that can bind to PEG molecules on stealth NPs but mimic the function of HER1 or HER2 were expressed on cancer cells to mimic targeted NPs without the need to covalently attach targeting ligands to the NPs . Confocal imaging , FACS , and RNAi studies demonstrated that chimeric HER1 and HER2 receptors on cancer cells were predictive of the endocytosis and routing of ligand - targeted NP to endogenous HER1 and HER2 on target cells . Our study suggests that this approach can be extended to other receptor targets by fusing the α PEG antibody to the transmembrane / endodomain of speci ﬁ c receptors . One can envision that a panel of cells expressing di ﬀ erent chimeric receptors could be developed to facilitate systematic screening for optimal cellular targets and NP properties for e ﬀ ective delivery and cellular response to nanocargos . It should also be possible to compare NP therapeutic activity in mice bearing tumors that express chimeric receptors as we previously demonstrated for tumors expressing a chimeric receptor based on the low - density lipoprotein receptor . 14 The major prerequisite for this approach is covalent attachment of PEG to the surface of the NPs , which is commonly used to improve the biological properties of many types of NPs including gold NPs , iron oxide NPs , PLGA NPs , mesoporous silica NPs , and liposomes . 49 , 50 Cells expressing a chimeric receptor were used to investigate the in ﬂ uence of NP size and rigidity on endocytosis and lysosomal accumulation . In general , we observed more rapid internalization of NPs via HER1 as compared to HER2 . Both large and small liposomes could be internalized via HER2 , but rigid NPs were very poorly internalized by this pathway . Lysosomal accumulation of NPs targeted to HER1 depended primarily on size , whereas NP rigidity appeared to be the Figure 8 . Comparison of cellular uptake of antibody - labeled NPs in SKBR3 cells and PEGylated NPs in α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 cells . Fluorescent - labeled small α H1 - liposomes ( A ) , large α H1 - liposomes ( B ) , small α H1 - L - MSN ( C ) , and large α H1 - L - MSN ( D ) were incubated with parental SKBR3 cells ( blue squares ) at 37 ° C for the indicated times before surface NPs were removed by an acid wash , and the remaining intracellular NPs were measured by FACS as described in the Methods section . The results are presented as the intracellular ﬂ uorescence at each time normalized to the initial surface ﬂ uorescence intensity at time zero . The cellular uptake pattern was compared to PEGylated NPs taken up in SKBR3 cells that express chimeric HER1 receptors ( red circles ) at di ﬀ erent times , as shown in Figure 7A . The results show the mean values of three replicates ± SD .

A dried lipid ﬁ lm was formed at 65 ° C by rotary evaporation ( Bu ̈ chi , Rotavapor RII , Switzerland ) and rehydrated in Tris - bu ﬀ ered saline ( TBS ; 50 mM Tris - HCl , 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4 ; degassed with sonication plus vacuum ) at 65 ° C to a ﬁ nal lipid concentration of 5 mg / mL . The liposomal suspension was submitted to ﬁ ve freeze / thaw cycles using liquid nitrogen and a water bath followed by extrusion 21 times at 70 ° C through 400 , 200 , and 80 nm polycarbonate membranes using a mini - extruder ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) . The α HER1 or α HER2 scFv were reduced for 30 min at 37 ° C with 5 mM dithiothreitol , and reducing agent was then removed by gel ﬁ ltration on a Sephadex G - 25 column . The reduced α HER1 or α HER2 scFv fragments were combined with liposomes at a molar ratio of 5 : 1 ( scFv : Mal - PEG 2000 - DSPE ) overnight at 4 ° C with shaking under a N 2 atmosphere . 58 Unconjugated scFv were removed by centrifugation at 40 000 rpm for 40 min at 4 ° C . The resulting immunoliposomes with covalently attached α HER1 or α HER2 scFv are denoted as α H1 - IL or α H2 - IL , respectively . Preparation of PEGylated Liposomes . PEG - liposomes were made in an analogous fashion as the immunoliposomes except that DSPC , PEG 2000 - DSPE , cholesterol , and DiIC18 ( 5 ) were dissolved in chloroform at a 64 . 5 : 5 : 30 : 0 . 5 molar ratio , respectively . Large and small PEG - liposomes were made by extrusion 21 times at 70 ° C through 400 and 200 nm polycarbonate membranes , whereas small PEG - liposomes were made by extrusion 21 times at 70 ° C through 400 , 200 , 80 , and 50 nm polycarbonate membranes .

Preparation of PEGylated Lipid - Coated MSNs . For generation of PEGylated lipid - coated MSN , DSPC , DSPE - PEG 2000 , cholesterol , and DiIC18 ( 5 ) were dissolved in chloroform at a 64 . 5 : 5 : 30 : 0 . 5 molar ratio , respectively . A dried lipid ﬁ lm was formed at 65 ° C by rotary evaporation and rehydrated in TBS at 65 ° C to a ﬁ nal lipid concentration of 20 mg / mL . Large MSN ( ∼ 200 nm ) and small MSN ( ∼ 80 nm ) were washed twice with 70 % EtOH and rehydrated in TBS at 10 mg / mL followed by sonication for 10 min . The lipids were added drop by drop to MSN with vortexing , and the mixture was submitted to 11 freeze / thaw cycles , followed by extrusion 21 times at 70 ° C through 400 and 200 nm polycarbonate membranes to generate large lipid - coated MSN ( L - MSN ) or by extrusion 21 times at 70 ° C through 400 , 200 , and 80 nm polycarbonate membranes to generate small L - MSN . Free lipids were removed by centrifugation ( 2300 g , 5 min ) and washing with PBS three times . Comparison of Liposome and Immunoliposome Binding to Cells . The binding of PEG - liposomes to cells was measured by incubating 5 × 10 5 α PEG - H1 / HT29 , α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 , α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 , HT29 , or SKBR3 cells with 5 μ g / mL PEGylated liposomes labeled with DiIC18 ( 5 ) in cold 0 . 05 % BSA / PBS for 1 h on ice . The binding of immunoliposomes to cancer cells was determined by incubating 5 × 10 5 SKBR3 ( HER1 + and HER2 + ) or HT29 ( HER1 + ) cells with 10 μ g / mL α H1 - IL or α H2 - IL on ice for 1 h . After being washed with cold 0 . 05 % BSA / PBS three times , the cells were stained with propidium iodide viability dye , and the surface ﬂ uorescence of liposomes on 10 4 viable cells was measured on a LSR II ﬂ ow cytometer ( BD Biosciences , Mountain View , CA , USA ) . Results are presented as mean ﬂ uorescence intensities ( MFI ) . siRNA Transfection . Small hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) plasmids for the AP2 and Eps15 genes were obtained from the National RNAi Core Facility ( Academia Sinica , Taipei , Taiwan ) . For AP2 or Eps15 knockdown , α PEG - H1 / HT29 , α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 , HT29 , and SKBR3 cells were seeded overnight in 6 - well plates at a density of 1 × 10 5 cells per well . Fresh medium without serum or antibiotics containing 8 μ g / mL Polybrene ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and 10 μ g / mL of lentivirus carrying shRNA targeting AP2 or Eps15 was added to the cells for 24 h . After lentiviral infection , the cells were selected in 2 μ g / mL puromycin for 2 days . Confocal Imaging of Liposomes in Cancer Cells . Cells ( 2 × 10 5 ) in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % FBS ( RMPI / 10 ) were seeded on a glass slide precoated with 40 μ g / mL poly - L - lysine overnight . The cells were incubated with 0 . 1 μ g / mL LysoTracker Red DND99 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) to stain lysosomes or 1 μ g / mL Hoechst 33342 ( Invitrogen ) to stain nuclei in RPMI for 30 min at 37 ° C in a humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere of air containing 5 % CO 2 . After being washed with RPMI / 10 , cells were incubated with 10 μ g / mL DiIC18 ( 5 ) - labeled PEGylated liposomes , immunoliposomes , or L - MSN for 2 h at 37 ° C before the ﬂ uorescence signals were detected on a Zeiss LSM780 laser scanning microscope ( Carl Zeiss AG , Germany ) . Initial digital image processing was performed using Zeiss LSM browser at excitation and emission wavelengths of 560 and 580 nm for LysoTracker Red DND99 and 650 and 675 nm for DiIC18 ( 5 ) . Colocalization studies were performed using ImageJ ( NIH ) by computing the overlap of individual pixels from the NP and lysosome ﬂ uorescence channels . Single cells were gated in each image , and the overlap coe ﬃ cient m 1 was calculated according to Manders to determine the true degree of colocalization . 60 S 1 represents signal intensity of pixels in the NP channel , and S 1 i , coloc represents the overlap of NP pixels and lysosome pixels . For example , if the green − red pair of channels is selected , and m 1 = 0 . 23 ; this means that 23 % of green pixels colocalize with red pixels . Figure 11 .

Maxisorp ﬂ at - bottom 96 - well plates were coated with 50 μ L / well of AGP4 anti - PEG antibody 38 ( 20 μ g / mL ) in coating bu ﬀ er ( 100 mM Na 2 CO 3 , pH 8 . 0 ) at room temperature and then at 4 ° C overnight . The wells were emptied and blocked with 5 % skim milk in PBS at 37 ° C for 2 h and then washed twice in PBS . PEGylated NPs or Doxisome ( PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin ; Taiwan Liposome Company , Ltd . ) were serially diluted in dilution bu ﬀ er ( 2 % skim milk in PBS ) , added to wells ( 50 μ L / well ) , and incubated at room temperature for 2 h . After being washed with PBS three times , the wells were sequentially incubated with 50 μ L / well of biotinylated anti - PEG antibody ( 3 . 3 - biotin , 5 μ g / mL in dilution bu ﬀ er ) and 50 μ L / well horseradish peroxidase - conjugated streptavidin ( 1 μ g / mL in dilution bu ﬀ er ) ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) . 38 After being incubated for 1 h at RT , the plates were washed with PBS eight times . The bound peroxidase activity was measured by adding 100 μ L / well ABTS solution [ 0 . 4 mg / mL , 2 , 2 ′ - azinobis ( 3 - ethylbenzthiazoline - 6 - sulfonic acid ) , 0 . 003 % H 2 O 2 , and 100 mM phosphate - citrate , pH 4 . 0 ) at room temperature . The absorbance ( 405 nm ) of the wells was measured in a microplate reader ( Molecular Device , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Cellular Uptake of NPs Measured by FACs . To compare the cellular uptake of di ﬀ erent PEGylated NPs by cells expressing chimeric HER1 or HER2 receptors , 5 × 10 5 α PEG - H1 / HT29 , α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 , α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 , HT29 , or SKBR3 cells were incubated with di ﬀ erent DiIC18 ( 5 ) - labeled NPs at equal concentrations of lipids ( 5 μ g / mL ) in RPMI medium for 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 h at 37 ° C . The unbound NPs were removed by washing the cells twice with 0 . 05 % BSA / PBS , followed by treatment of the cells with cold citric acid bu ﬀ er ( pH 3 . 0 ) for 3 min ( acid wash ) 39 to remove the noninternalized NPs before washing again with 0 . 05 % BSA / PBS twice . The cells were stained with propidium iodide viability dye , and the ﬂ uorescence of the NPs in 10 4 viable cells was measured on a LSR II ﬂ ow cytometer ( BD Biosciences , Mountain View , CA , USA ) . To measure the initial binding of NPs to the cells , 5 × 10 5 cells were incubated with the di ﬀ erent NPs at equal concentrations of lipids ( 5 μ g / mL ) in RPMI medium for 1 h on ice . After being washed with cold 0 . 05 % BSA / PBS three times , the cells were stained with propidium iodide , and the surface ﬂ uorescence of liposomes on 10 4 viable cells was measured on a LSR II ﬂ ow cytometer ( BD Biosciences , Mountain View , CA , USA ) . The relative uptake ( % ) was corrected by subtracting NP background binding to cells and then normalized to the amount of NPs binding to the cells at time zero by the formula : = − ° × relative uptake % [ ( NP MFI at each time after acid wash initial NP MFI after acid wash ) / ( initial NP MFI at 4 C ) ] 100 where NP MFI is the NP mean ﬂ uorescence intensity . Cell Proliferation Assay . SKBR3 , α PEG - H1 / SKBR3 , and α PEG - H2 / SKBR3 cells ( 1 × 10 4 ) were seeded in 96 - well plates overnight . The next day , graded concentrations of Doxisome were added in triplicate to the wells for 2 or 6 h at 37 ° C . After the medium was removed and fresh medium was added , the cells were incubated for 48 h to allow the drug to act on the cells . The cells were then pulsed with 3 H - thymidine ( 1 μ Ci / well ) for 18 h to measure the rate of DNA synthesis , which re ﬂ ects the total cell proliferative capacity in each well . The cells were harvested , and the radioactivity was measured on a TopCount microplate scintillation counter ( Packard , Detroit , MI ) . Results are expressed as percent 3 H - thymidine incorporation compared with untreated control cells by the following formula : ‐ = × H thymidine incorporation ( % ) sample cpm untreated control cpm 100 3 IC 50 values were calculated by ﬁ tting the data to a log ( inhibitor ) versus response ( variable slopes model ) with Prism 5 software ( Graphpad Software , San Diego , CA ) . Statistical Analysis . Statistical signi ﬁ cance of di ﬀ erences between mean values was estimated with Graphpad or Excel ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA ) using the independent Student ’ s t test for unequal variances ; p values < 0 . 05 were considered to be statistically signi ﬁ cant .
