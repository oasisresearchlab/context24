Meyer , University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , NC , November 6 , 1998 ( received for review April 9 , 1998 ) ABSTRACT The atomic force microscope ( AFM ) was employed to investigate the extension and retraction dynamics of protruding and stable edges of motile 3T3 fibroblasts in culture . Such dynamics closely paralleled the results of earlier studies employing video microscopy that indicated that the AFM force - mapping technique does not appreciably perturb these dynamics . Force scans permitted height determinations of active and stable edges . Whereas the profiles of active edges are flat with average heights of 0 . 4 – 0 . 8 m m , stable edges smoothly ascend to 2 – 3 m m within about 6 m m of the edge . In the region of the leading edge , the height fluctuates up to 50 % ( SD ) of the mean value , much more than the stable edge ; this fluctuation presumably reflects differences in underlying cytoskeletal activity . In addition , force mapping yields an estimate of the local Young’s modulus or modulus of elasticity ( E , the cortical stiffness ) . This stiffness will be related to ‘‘cortical tension , ’’ can be accurately calculated for the stable edges , and is ’ 12 kPa in this case . The thinness of the leading edge precludes accurate estimation of the E values , but within 4 m m of the margin it is considerably smaller than that for stable edges , which have an upper limit of 3 – 5 kPa . Although blebbing cannot absolutely be ruled out as a mechanism of extension , the data are consistent with an actin polymeriza - tion and y or myosin motor mechanism in which the average material properties of the extending margin would be nearly constant to the edge . Because the leading edge is softer than the stable edge , these data also are consistent with the notion that extension preferentially occurs in regions of lower cor - tical tension . Cell locomotion consists of a complex set of integrated mo - lecular events that are vital to many life processes . Recently , considerable progress has been made in uncovering various molecular mechanisms that must be involved in locomotion ( for reviews , see refs . 1 and 2 ) . Less is known about the physical properties of moving cells , including the mechanical properties of the cell surface and the actual forces involved in locomotion ( 3 , 4 ) . Local measurements of the surface stiffness and prop - erties of the leading edge have been made by using ‘‘cell poking’’ ( 5 ) and microneedles ( 6 ) . Recently , the laser trap has been used to probe connections between cell - surface integrins and the membrane - associated cytoskeleton to compare the leading and trailing edge of fibroblasts ( 7 , 8 ) . Such connections also have been probed by using magnetic methods ( 9 ) . Ad - vances in silicone rubber substratum technology have permit - ted the imaging of traction forces used by highly motile fish - scale keratocytes ( 10 – 12 ) and in cells undergoing cytoki - nesis ( 13 ) . Fibroblast traction forces have been investigated by using silicon microlevers embedded in a silicon substrate ( 14 ) , and the manifestations of these forces were studied by em - ploying a deformable polyacrylamide substrate ( 15 ) . The atomic force microscope ( AFM ) ( 16 ) has evolved to become a very important tool in the family of scanning - probe microscopy techniques . Because it can easily be operated in a liquid environment , particularly under physiological condi - tions ( 17 ) , biological processes at the cellular ( 18 ) and even molecular ( 19 ) level can be investigated . AFM combines in a unique way high spatial resolution ( 20 ) with very high force sensitivity ( 21 ) , with the result that the elastic properties of biological samples can be measured ( reviewed in ref . 22 ) . The spatial resolution and force sensitivity of AFM are combined in the force - mapping mode ( 23 ) , which can be used to map the viscoelastic properties of living cells in considerable spatial detail ( 24 – 26 ) . The resulting images can be thought of as a pixel - by - pixel ‘‘cell poking’’ experiment ( 5 ) yielding a map of the local modulus of elasticity ( E ) . E is the basic measure relating stress applied to the specimen to the resulting strain in the sample ; values range from ’ 200 GPa for very hard materials such as steel to between 1 and 100 kPa for cellular specimens ( 22 ) . In this paper , we demonstrate that the AFM force - mapping mode allows the protrusion of active cell edges to be interro - gated in terms of the kinetics , thickness , and mechanical properties of the protrusion . The results are compared with the more stable edges of motile fibroblasts . The data permit calculation of the local value of E to a spatial resolution of about 100 nm . E is a measure of cortical stiffness , a function of the material properties of the cytoskeleton and , when it is present , cortical tension . Thus , for example , higher cortical stiffness could result from an intrinsically stiffer cytoskeletal matrix and y or from increased cortical tension in the specimen . The derived mechanical properties of the leading edge are discussed in terms of current models for protrusion . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells . 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM supple - mented with 5 % fetal calf serum and 1 % penicillin y streptomycin ( GIBCO ) following standard procedures . Cells were plated in 35 - mm plastic Petri dishes ( Nunclon , Naper - ville , IL ) and cultured at 37°C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Typically , cells were subcultured 1 or 2 days before the experiment . Atomic Force Microscopy . A commercial AFM ( Bioscope ; Digital Instruments , Santa Barbara , CA ) combined with an Axiomat custom - modified inverted optical microscope ( Zeiss ) was employed for these studies . This combination allowed lateral positioning of the AFM tip on the sample to micrometer precision .

The AFM was covered with a gastight Plexiglas box so that the environment of the specimen could be controlled . Resistance - heating of this specimen chamber was accomplished by gluing resistors to the stage ( a 20 - mm thick stainless steel plate ) of the optical microscope on top of which the AFM and the sample were mounted . Spec - imen temperature was monitored with a PT100 sensor by using a commercial display unit ( DPM 235 ; Schwille Elektronik , Kircheim , Germany ) to measure temperature . CO 2 was flushed slowly through the chamber to maintain a steady - state concentration of 5 % as measured with a gas sensor ( Model IR1580 diffusion probe ; Servomex , Crowborough , U . K . ) . Data Acquisition . E can be calculated from force curves , in which the deflection of the AFM cantilever is monitored as it approaches the sample . The deflection will be zero as long as the AFM tip is off the surface and will increase monotonically beyond the contact point . This increase is linear on a stiff sample ; however , it will be smaller and nonlinear on softer samples . To measure local , laterally resolved E , the AFM was operated in the force - mapping or force - volume mode . A force map is a two - dimensional array of force curves recorded while the tip is raster - scanned across the sample . Because it takes about 20 minutes to record a single map of 64 3 64 force curves , standard force mapping is not suitable for investigating processes as rapid as protrusive activity . Therefore , two - dimensional resolution had to be sacrificed by using the y - disable mode ( where force curves are continuously recorded along the same line ) . The calculation then yields time se - quences of height and elasticity profiles along a single , scanned line . Data Analysis . To calculate E from the force curves , we employed Sneddon’s modification of the Hertzian model for the elastic indentation of a flat , soft sample by a stiff cone ( 28 , 29 ) . The model relates the applied loading force F to the indentation depth d : F 5 2 p 3 tan ( a ) 3 E 1 2 n 2 3 d 2 . [ 1 ] Here , E is the Young’s modulus , n is the Poisson ratio of the sample , and a is the half - opening angle of the AFM tip . On a stiff sample , the cantilever deflection d ( z ) will be equal to the piezo movement z , whereas on a soft sample the deflection is decreased because of elastic indentation : d ~ z ! 5 z 2 d . [ 2 ] The force can be obtained by multiplying the measured cantilever deflection d ( z ) by the known spring constant k of the cantilever : F 5 k z d ~ z ! [ 3 ] Thus , we can substitute F and d in Eq . 1 to obtain E as a function of the measured quantities z and d ( z ) . Fitting this function to the force - curve data will not only yield E but also the position z 0 , where the cantilever initially contacts the sample , which corresponds to the real height of the sample at the point where the force curve was recorded . This calculation is described elsewhere in more detail ( 30 ) . The Hertzian model has been derived for an infinitely thick soft sample . It also can be applied to thin films as long as the indentation into the sample by the tip is sufficiently small compared with its thickness . This is demonstrated in Fig . 1 a , where a typical force curve obtained on a thicker stable edge is fitted by the Hertz model in four different ranges of cantilever deflection ( arrows indicate zero deflection ) . Calcu - lated contact points ( arrowheads ) do not differ significantly . At the leading margin , however , there are locations where cell heights are only 200 – 300 nm , and the indentation depth becomes significant compared with sample thickness . Thus , at higher loading forces , the tip will sense the elastic properties of the underlying stiff substrate and the calculated E must be considered an upper limit of the actual values . Different fits to a sample force curve obtained on a flat lamellipodium are shown in Fig . 1 b . Only for the lowest range of analysis does the F IG . 1 .

( b ) Typical force curve on a thin part of a protruding edge fitted in four different deflection ranges showing that the curve can only be fit by the Hertz model in the lowest applied force regime . For a and b , cantilever deflection range used for the fit is shown in nm at right margin , arrows indicate zero deflection , calculated contact points are indicated by arrowheads , and values of E are given in c .

USA 96 ( 1999 ) calculation yield a contact point at a position where the deflection does not differ appreciably from the zero deflection value . Thus , we conclude that the influence of the substratum is lowest if force curves from such thin regions of the cell are fit to the Hertz model in the lowest force regime ( small cantilever deflections ) . This procedure gives the best fit of the data and allows a reasonable estimate of specimen height . It should be noted that the calculated cell heights will not necessarily reflect the undisturbed topography of the cell if , for example , the surface is covered with a layer that is too soft to deflect the cantilever , such as the glycocalyx . The influence of noise in the determination of zero deflec - tion was reduced by averaging deflection values of various points in the off - surface portion of the force curve . The z height of the contact point is then calculated by fitting the force curve in a higher deflection regime to the Hertz model and extrapolating the fit curve to zero deflection . This procedure will reduce noise significantly . The dependence of measured E values as a function of mean loading force ( corresponding to the range of cantilever de - flections employed for analysis ) shows that the calculated values are independent of the range of analysis for stable edges but depend on this parameter for protruding edges ( Fig . 1 c ) . Consequently , analysis typically was carried out for small cantilever deflections in the range of 10 – 40 nm ( corresponding to 80 – 320 pN ) to minimize the influence of the underlying stiff substrate . RESULTS Kinetics of Edge Dynamics . The AFM in the present con - figuration can be used to ‘‘visualize’’ various properties of live cells while allowing their motile state to be maintained . A typical AFM deflection image of a region of a motile NIH 3T3 fibroblast is seen in Fig . 2 . ( The deflection mode of imaging is sensitive to local slope and is somewhat analogous in this sense to a differential - interference contrast image . ) Successive line scans of force curves across active and stable edges ( compare encircled and rectangular regions in Fig . 2 ) were recorded to yield time sequences of height and elasticity profiles along the scan line for a protruding ( Fig . 3 a and b ) and a more stable ( Fig . 3 c and d ) edge . By thresholding the elasticity data , the intersections of the line scan with the edge were calculated , and thus the dynamics of both edge types could be tracked at the frequency of the line scan ( Fig . 3 a and c Inset ) . Over a period of about 30 min , the leading edge extends in a fluctuating manner about 10 m m . We use the term ‘‘stable’’ edge some - what loosely , as the edge does not move actively but rather undergoes a slow extension of about 4 m m during the obser - vation period . The position of the edge , sampled at a frequency of 0 . 1 Hz , is shown for the leading and trailing edges in Fig . 3 a and c ( Inset ) , respectively . It is clear that the leading edge is much more dynamic than the stable edge in terms of fluctuations in the position of the margin . By differentiating this data , instan - taneous velocities of protrusion and retraction can be calcu - F IG . 2 .

USA 96 ( 1999 ) 923 lated . With the differentiation algorithm used , the minimum detectable instantaneous velocity ( 5 . 2 nm y s 5 0 . 31 m m y min ) represents edge movement of 1 pixel ( 110 nm ) during the time needed to record two lines of force curves ( 21 s ) . Mean velocities can be calculated with a better accuracy of 0 . 055 nm y s ( 1 pixel in 2 , 000 s ) . The distribution of instantaneous velocities is shown for both extending ( Fig . 4 a ) and stable ( Fig . 4 b ) edges . For the extending edge , the mean velocity of extension is 5 . 5 nm y s ( 0 . 33 m m y min ) and is composed of both protruding and retracting phases . Because the protruding phase dominates , the edge undergoes net extension . For both phases , maximum velocities are 50 – 60 nm y s ( 0 . 8 – 1 . 0 m m y min ) . The stable edge does not fluctuate appreciably , but rather extends slowly , with a mean velocity of 2 . 2 nm y s ( 0 . 13 m m y min ) . Here , 93 % of the measured velocity values are less than or equal to the minimum detectable value ( 6 5 . 2 nm y s ) . Force Mapping Permits Height Determinations of Cell Edges . The data in Fig . 3 a and c constitute time series of height profiles permitting the thickness of the cell edges to be determined as described in Materials and Methods . Average height profiles of protruding and stable edges are shown in Fig . 5 Lower and were obtained by averaging the rows after aligning all of the lines in Fig . 3 so that the cell edge was at the same lateral position . One issue that arises is whether the AFM cantilever is compressing ruffles . We argue that for these cells this is not the case . Ruffles are comparatively stiff structures ( 6 ) ; this stiff - ness prevents them from being entirely compressed by the AFM tip . To test this notion , we deliberately detached a leading edge from the substrate before force mapping . In the height and elasticity images calculated from the force map , these artificial ruffle - like structures were clearly visible ( data not shown ) . Because similar structures were not observed in the data reported , we conclude that no large ruffles were present . It is possible , however , that fluctuations in height at a single position in the leading lamella reflected the retrograde movement of small ruffles ( see below ) . Spatially Resolved E Values for Leading and Stable Edges . E can be calculated from the force - displacement curves by using the Hertz model ( 24 ) . These data are shown in image format in Fig . 3 b and d . The band structure in the data set for the stable edge presumably arises from fibers perpendicular to F IG . 4 .

USA 96 ( 1999 ) the scan line having larger apparent E values . Average profiles of E are shown in Fig . 5 Upper . On the stable edges , E decreases from ’ 12 kPa to ’ 5 kPa 5 m m from the edge . Again , spatial variations are measured that may correspond to regions con - taining actin stress fibers ( 31 ) . In such regions , E increases distinctly , but it should be noted that the values for E on stress fibers are approximations , because the Hertz model assumes homogeneity of the soft sample—an assumption that is vio - lated when fibers are present . As indicated in Materials and Methods , for the stable edges , the values of E do not appre - ciably depend on the force range used for analysis ( Fig . 1 c ) . In the thin parts of the protruding lamellae , the E values depend on force , but at low force values there is a reasonable fit to the Hertz model ( Fig . 1 b ) . E values in these regions ( Fig . 1 c ) are in the range of 3 – 5 kPa and are an upper limit because of the influence of the substratum . Fluctuations in Height Are More Pronounced in Active than Stable Edges . From the family of successive line scans taken at the same position , the height and E value at given distances behind the leading and stable edges can be recorded as functions of time . In Fig . 6 , the time variations of height are given for a point 700 nm behind the leading and stable edges . At this point , where both the leading and stable edges have similar average heights , the fluctuations in height are consid - erably greater in the leading lamella . Time - dependent fluctu - ations also occur in E ( data not shown ) , but there is a correlation between height and elasticity data that may reflect , in part , the influence of the underlying stiff substrate . These differences in height and elasticity fluctuations presumably reflect differences in underlying cytoskeletal dynamics in the two regions . In particular , height fluctuations in the leading lamella could reflect the passage of small ( , 1 - m m high ) ruffles . DISCUSSION Although fibroblasts often have a mean velocity of less than 1 m m y min , it is well known that their leading edge is dynamic , often protruding at rates many times exceeding that of the mean cell velocity . Given the differences in cell types , our measurements are in general agreement with the earlier literature ( 6 , 32 ) in terms of mean velocities of protrusion having an average of about 5 m m y min . At the leading margin , numerous brief retracting phases are superimposed on the general protrusive activity . These fluctuations and the simi - larities of the velocities of the forward and backward phases also are in agreement with the results of Ambercrombie et al . ( 32 ) . The predominance of the protrusive phase results in an overall extension of the edge ( 32 ) . On the other hand , for chicken heart fibroblasts , the work of Felder and Elson ( 6 ) showed that a nearly constant velocity of protrusion occurred in lamellar extension preceded by rapid acceleration and ending with a quick deceleration . In addition , the earlier work on chicken heart fibroblasts ( 6 , 32 ) detected the centripetal movement of ruffles . Such movement was not observed in the study of NIH 3T3 cells , although modest thickenings of the lamella were seen ( see , for example , Fig . 3 a at 750 s and 1 , 300 s ) . However , the general agreement of the AFM results with those obtained by light microscopy suggests that interrogation of the edge by soft AFM cantilevers does not greatly perturb the system . Mechanisms for protrusion can be divided into several classes ( 2 , 33 ) : protrusion driven by actin polymerization ; protrusion driven by myosin I - type motors with obligate actin polymerization ; osmotic gel swelling ; or pressure - driven bleb - bing ( toothpaste tube model ) . Regulation of protrusive and retractive phases , which would be responsible for fluctuations in edge position ( as the lamellipod generally extends ) is likely to be complex . For example , as suggested by Welch et al . ( 34 ) , a protrusive phase could result from a burst of actin polymer - ization , a reduction of myosin - powered retraction , an increase in substratum coupling anchoring the actin - based cytoskeleton and preventing retrograde actin flow within the lamellipod , or a combination of such factors . On the other hand , an increase in myosin activity or a decrease in actin polymerization at the edge may produce the transient retractive phases observed in lamellar extension . The elasticity data ( Fig . 5 a ) are not consistent with a blebbing mechanism of protrusion because ( to 100 - nm spatial resolution ) no pronounced softening of the leading edge is measured , which would be envisioned in such a mechanism ( 33 , 35 , 36 ) . Such softening on a length scale detectable by force mapping would be expected for a blebbing mechanism in which the bleb is initially deficient in cytoskeletal structure ( 35 ) because blebs have micrometer dimensions ( 35 , 37 ) . Indeed , softening due to loss of f - actin structure caused by the cytochalasins can be observed in mechanical indentation measurements ( 5 , 25 , 31 , 38 ) . It should be noted that there are cells in which blebbing clearly appears to be the predominant mode of protrusion ( 35 , 37 ) . The lack of softening also argues against the osmotic gel - swelling mechanism postulated by Oster and Perelson ( 39 ) where f - actin crosslinks are severed , allowing the gel to swell to a new equilibrium position provided such softening is not confined to within approximately 100 nm of the leading edge . Our measurements are consistent with a straight actin polymerization mechanism for protrusion ( 40 ) or one that combines obligatory actin polymerization with the action of myosin I - type motors ( 2 ) to extend the leading edge . In this regard , it is significant that actin polymerization models can account for this protrusion rate both in terms of actual growth ( 40 ) and in terms of diffusional delivery of actin monomer to the leading edge ( 41 ) . The original Brownian ratchet mecha - nism requires excursions of the leading edge of ’ 5 nm ( diameter of actin ) to allow insertion of an actin monomer . Such softening owing to the fluctuating leading edge would be undetectable at the resolution of current force mapping ( 100 nm ) . In the event that membrane fluctuations are damped , bending of the terminal actin filaments is hypothesized to permit insertion ( 42 ) . It also is possible that hydrostatic pressure within the cell caused by contraction ( 43 ) provides just enough displacement at the edge to allow insertion of actin monomer . These latter mechanisms , too , will permit extension without softening of the leading edge on a length scale detectable by force mapping . The polymerization or motor - plus - polymerization mechanisms also are consistent with the material properties of the leading edge being constant to the edge , a view supported by electron microscopy of the dense lamellipodial actin network ( 44 , 45 ) . F IG . 6 . Variations of cell height with time 700 nm behind the leading and stable edges . Cell Biology : Rotsch et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 96 ( 1999 ) 925 Cortical tension is a term often invoked to explain properties of motile systems ( 46 ) . Force mapping provides a measure of cortical stiffness to which cortical tension will contribute . For example , the fact that the leading edge is softer ( lower E value ) within 4 m m from the edge than the stable edge is consistent with the notion that lower cortical tension is associated with regions of the cell that are capable of extension ( 47 ) .
