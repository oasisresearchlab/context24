Here , we report that Numb interacts with E - cadherin ( E - cad ) through its phosphotyrosine - binding domain ( PTB ) and thereby regulates the localization of E - cad to the lateral domain of epithelial cell – cell junction . Moreover , Numb engages the polarity complex Par3 – aPKC – Par6 by binding to Par3 in polarized Madin - Darby canine kidney cells . Intriguingly , after Src activation or hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) treatment , Numb decou - ples from E - cad and Par3 and associates preferably with aPKC – Par6 . Binding of Numb to aPKC is necessary for sequestering the latter in the cytosol during HGF - induced EMT . Knockdown of Numb by small hairpin RNA caused a basolateral - to - apicolateral translocation of E - cad and b - catenin accompanied by elevated actin polymerization , accumulation of Par3 and aPKC in the nucleus , an enhanced sensitivity to HGF - induced cell scattering , a decrease in cell – cell adhesion , and an increase in cell migration . Our work identiﬁes Numb as an important regulator of epithelial polarity and cell – cell adhesion and a sensor of HGF signalling or Src activity during EMT .

Epithelial - mesenchy - mal transition ( EMT ) consists of several steps : the dissolution of tight junctions ( TJs ) , loss of cell – cell adhesion , loss of apico – basal polarity , reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and an increase in cell motility ( Guarino , 2007 ; Guarino et al , 2007 ; Hugo et al , 2007 ; Levayer and Lecuit , 2008 ; Mandal et al , 2008 ) . Polarized epithelial cells contain both TJs and adherens junctions ( AJs ) ( Gumbiner , 2005 ; Shin et al , 2006 ; Wang and Margolis , 2007 ) . TJs are formed by the transmem - brane proteins occludin and claudin , and the cytoplasmic proteins ZO - 1 , - 2 and - 3 ( Hartsock and Nelson , 2008 ) . The evolutionarily conserved Par3 – Par6 – aPKC polarity complex has an essential function in the establishment of the TJ ( Macara , 2004 ; Margolis and Borg , 2005 ; Suzuki and Ohno , 2006 ) . Par6 contains an N - terminal Phox - Bem1 ( PB1 ) domain that binds to the PB1 domain of aPKC through heterodimer - ization , a C - terminal PDZ domain that binds the Par3 PDZ domain , and a Cdc42 – Rac interaction binding motif that recruits the small GTPase Cdc42 or Rac to the complex ( Wang et al , 2004 ; Margolis and Borg , 2005 ; Wang and Margolis , 2007 ) . The AJs are maintained by E - cadherin ( E - cad ) , p120 - catenin ( p120 ) , b - catenin and a - catenin that form a dynamically regulated complex coupled to the actin cytoskeleton ( Drees et al , 2005 ; Yamada et al , 2005 ; Hartsock and Nelson , 2008 ) . On the initiation of EMT , polarized epithelial cells gradually lose their apical – basal polarity and cell – cell junctions and acquire the characteristics of mesench - ymal cells capable of migrating away from the primary site into surrounding tissues . EMT is often induced by excessive signalling of a growth factor such as the transforming growth factor - b 1 ( TGF - b 1 ) , the hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) or the ﬁbroblast growth factor ( FGF ) , or by aberrant activation of a non - receptor protein kinases ( PK ) such as Src ( Birchmeier et al , 2003 ; Avizienyte et al , 2004 ; Avizienyte and Frame , 2005 ; Wang et al , 2008 ) . A long - standing question in cancer metastasis is how external stimuli - induced signals may regulate cell polar - ity and cell – cell adhesion to induce EMT . Recent work has begun to shed light on this important issue . For example , Par6 was shown to interact with TGF - b receptor and function as a direct substrate of TGF - b RII . Moreover , phosphorylated Par6 recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 and thereby promotes localized RhoA degradation and ultimately leads to loss of TJ ( Ozdamar et al , 2005 ; Bose and Wrana , 2006 ) . The activated ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase was shown to signal through the polarity complex Par6 – aPKC to disrupt apical – basal po - larity in breast epithelial cells ( Aranda et al , 2006 ) . Wang et al identiﬁed Par3 as a substrate of c - Src or c - Yes and showed that abrogation of Par3 tyrosine phosphorylation promoted its dissociation from the LIM kinase 2 and delayed TJ assembly ( Wang et al , 2006 ) . These studies suggest extensive interplays between kinase signalling and cell polarity and call for further investigation into the underlying mechanism .

In support of this notion , Rasin et al have shown that Numb and Numbl ( Numblike ) are required for the maintenance of cadherin - based adhesion and polarity in neural progenitors ( Rasin et al , 2007 ) . Speciﬁcally , inactivation of Numb in these neuroepithelial cells results in a basolateral - to - apical membrane transloca - tion of cadherin ( Rasin et al , 2007 ) . An interaction between Numb and E - cad has been observed both in vitro and in ependymal cells of the postnatal mouse brain ( Kuo et al , 2006 ) . Moreover , Numb was found to bind Par3 and control directional cell migration by modulating the trafﬁcking of integrins ( Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) . The asymmetric localization of Numb during the division of Drosophila neuroblasts is controlled by aPKC , which phosphorylates Numb on speciﬁc serine residues and results in its release from the apical cortex ( Smith et al , 2007 ) . Here , we use the Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cell line to characterize a role for Numb in regulating epithelial polarity and cell – cell adhesion and in HGF - induced EMT . HGF engages the Met receptor , which , in turn , activates downstream signalling proteins such as the Src kinase ( Ponzetto et al , 1994 ; Boyer et al , 1997 ) . Activation of Src has been shown to promote E - cad phosphorylation and internalization ( Fujita et al , 2002 ; Pece and Gutkind , 2002 ; Palovuori et al , 2003 ) , whereas loss of E - cad expression or its mislocalization has been implicated in cancer progression and metastasis ( Thiery and Sleeman , 2006 ; Jeanes et al , 2008 ; Yang and Weinberg , 2008 ) . We show here that Numb binds to E - cad through a conserved NVYY motif in the cytoplasmic domain , but that this interaction is abolished by tyrosine phosphorylation . In the absence of a tyrosine kinase signal , Numb is associated with Par3 , but on addition of HGF or the activation of Src , Numb decouples from Par3 and now binds selectively to aPKC – Par6 , sequestering the latter in the cyto - solic and membrane compartments during HGF - induced EMT . Using E - cad mutants and small hairpin RNA ( sh - RNA ) - mediated knockdown of Numb in MDCK cells , we further show that Numb is necessary for the proper subcel - lular localization of E - cad , b - catenin and the Par3 – Par6 – aPKC polarity proteins . Accordingly , depletion of Numb sensitizes cells to HGF - induced EMT by causing a decrease in cell – cell adhesion and an increase in cell motility . Results Tyrosine phosphorylation negatively regulates binding of the Numb PTB domain to an NVYY motif in E - cad To understand the function of the Numb – E - cad interaction in epithelial cells , we ﬁrst established by co - immunoprecipita - tion ( co - IP ) that endogenous Numb and E - cad interacted in MDCKII cells ( Figure 1A ) . To determine whether the Numb – E - cad interaction was modulated by tyrosine kinase signal - ling , cells were either incubated with the phosphatase in - hibitor pervanadate or transfected with a v - src - expressing vector , both of which signiﬁcantly enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation level of E - cad ( Figure 1A ) . The phosphor - ylation of E - cad in v - src - transfected cells was not as pro - nounced as in pervanate - treated cells , likely due to the more speciﬁc effect of Src in comparison to pervanadate . Conversely , cells were treated with PP2 , an Src - speciﬁc kinase inhibitor to suppress phosphorylation . Although the Numb – E - cad interaction was attenuated by pervanadate and completely abolished by v - Src expression , it was strengthened by PP2 treatment ( Figure 1A ) . These data show that the Numb – E - cad interaction is negatively regulated by Src activity . Sensitivity of the Numb – E - cad interaction to tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter prompted us to investigate a potential role for the PTB domain in regulating Numb binding to E - cad . Indeed , a GST - fused Numb - PTB domain , but not GST alone , precipitated E - cad from the MDCKII cell lysate ( Figure 1B ) . In searching for a PTB - binding site in E - cad , we performed a multiple sequence alignment and identiﬁed a potential PTB - binding motif , NVYY , in the cytoplasmic do - main of E - cad ( Figure 1C ) . This motif is conserved in vertebrates and conforms to the canonical N [ V / I ] [ Y / F ] [ Y / F ] motif determined earlier for the Numb PTB domain ( Zwahlen et al , 2000 ) . To conﬁrm this prediction , a ‘peptide - walking’ array ( Jia et al , 2005 ) representing the cytoplasmic region of human E - cad was synthesized and probed for binding to puriﬁed Numb - PTB domain . From this experiment , we iden - tiﬁed the peptide , DNVYY 754 , as the minimum sequence required for binding ( Figure 1D ) . Besides containing a cano - nical PTB - binding motif , NVYY , this peptide overlaps with a tyrosine triad , YYY . To evaluate the importance of tyrosine residues in PTB binding , we synthesized peptide analogs in which the triad Tyr residues were replaced , individually or in combination , by Ala , Phe or pTyr residues . Probing of the resulting peptide array by Numb - PTB revealed that the ﬁrst two tyrosines in the triad were essential for binding because their respective substitution by an Ala led to a marked reduction or complete loss of afﬁnity . Intriguingly , substitu - tion of any Tyr residue in the triad by a pTyr abrogated binding , echoing earlier results showing an inhibitory effect of phosphorylation on the Numb – E - cad interaction . This observation is also reminiscent of the interaction between the tensin - 1 PTB domain and b - integrin in which tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter had a negative effect on the interaction ( McCleverty et al , 2007 ) . In agreement with the peptide array results , an E - cad mutant , E - cad ( 3A ) in which the Tyr triad was replaced by an Ala triad ( i . e . YYY to AAA ) , failed to bind Numb , whereas the triple F mutant , E - Cad ( 3F ) ( i . e . YYY to FFF ) was as effective as the wild - type ( wt ) E - cad in precipitating Numb ( Figure 1E ) . HGF signalling or Src activation regulates dynamic interactions of Numb with E - cad and components of the Par polarity complex As E - cad can be phosphorylated at the triad tyrosines during an EMT induced by the activation of Src or a receptor tyrosine kinase ( Fujita et al , 2002 ) , it is likely that a dynamic Numb – E - cad interaction has a function in this process . To explore this notion , we examined , by reciprocal co - IP and western blotting , the complex of Numb and E - cad in MDCKI cells transformed by a temperature - sensitive allele of src ( Behrens et al , 1993 ) . The ts - src - MDCKI cells formed normal cell – cell junctions when cultured as a monolayer at the non - permis - sive temperature of 40 1 C but acquired characteristics of mesenchymal cells at the permissive temperature of 35 1 C when Src was expressed ( Supplementary Figure S1A ) . Numb regulates epithelial polarity and cell – cell adhesion Z Wang et al & 2009 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 28 | NO 16 | 2009 2361 Parallel experiments were carried out in MDCKII cells treated with HGF to mimic EMT ( Balkovetz et al , 1997 ) . Although both MDCKI and MDCKII are epithelial cells derived from renal tubules , the MDCKII strain exhibits less clonal variation than MDCKI ( Richardson et al , 1981 ; Matter and Balda , 2003 ) . As the MDCKII strain is used more widely in the literature , we felt it necessary to repeat the experiments done in ts - src - MDCKI cells in this strain . As shown in Figure 2A , Numb bound strongly to E - cad in ts - src - MDCKI cells cultured at 40 1 C in the absence of Src , but the interaction was abolished at 35 1 C when Src was expressed . Similarly , Numb was decoupled from E - cad after HGF treatment of MDCKII cells ( Figure 2A ) . As E - cad is tyrosine phosphory - lated on Src expression or HGF stimulation ( Figure 2B ) , it is likely that phosphorylation of one or more Tyr residue at the YYY triad in E - cad abrogated its binding to Numb .

Numb regulates epithelial polarity and cell – cell adhesion Z Wang et al The EMBO Journal VOL 28 | NO 16 | 2009 & 2009 European Molecular Biology Organization 2362 we examined whether these interactions could be modulated by tyrosine kinase signalling . Indeed , Numb exhibited dis - tinct binding preference for components of the Par3 – Par6 – aPKC complex in both ts - src - MDCKI and MDCKII cells , depending on the status of Src activation . Under basal con - ditions when Src was not activated , Numb bound strongly to all three isoforms of Par3 ( but most strongly to the 150kDa variant ) and moderately to aPKC . Nevertheless , on Src expression or HGF treatment , the Numb – aPKC interaction was signiﬁcantly augmented , whereas the Numb – Par3 inter - action markedly reduced ( Figure 2A and C ; Supplementary Figure S1C ) . Furthermore , compared with a constitutive interaction between aPKC and Par6 that appeared to be independent of Src activation ( Figure 2C ) , Par3 was disso - ciated from the aPKC – Par6 complex in response to Src activation ( Figure 2C ; Supplementary Figure S1C ) .

( B ) Tyrosine phosphorylation of E - cadherin , aPKC , Par6 or Par3 was examined with a speciﬁc anti - phospho - tyrosine antibody ( 4G10 ) under conditions speciﬁed in ( A ) . E - cadhrin , aPKC , Par6 and Par3 ( 100kDa , 150kD and 180kDa isoforms ) were phosphorylated when Src was activated . In contrast , under HGF treatment , only Par6 and the 150kD Par3 isoform were signiﬁcantly phosphorylated while E - cadherin was weakly phosphorylated . ( C ) Co - IP of aPKC with Par6 , Par3 and Numb , respectively , under conditions speciﬁed in ( A ) .

Tyrosine phosphorylation of E - cadherin enhanced its binding to p120 - , but not to b - catenin .

Numb regulates epithelial polarity and cell – cell adhesion Z Wang et al & 2009 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 28 | NO 16 | 2009 2363 contrast , the Numb – Par3 interaction was strengthened by PP2 treatment , but diminished in cells over - expressing v - Src ( Supplementary Figure S1C and E ) . As Par3 , Par6 and aPKC were all tyrosine phosphorylated by Src ( Figure 2B ) , it is likely that phosphorylation played an important function in shifting their respective binding afﬁnity and preference for one another and for Numb . We next examined the effect of Src activation on the integrity of the cadherin complex by western blotting . E - cad bound strongly to b - catenin but only weakly to p120 - catenin under basal conditions . In contrast , the E - cad – p120 interac - tion was enhanced in both ts - src - transformed ( 35 1 C ) and HGF - treated cells , whereas the E - cad – b - catenin interaction was signiﬁcantly attenuated in v - src - transformed but not in HGF - treated cells , suggesting that the activation of Src in the latter case was not as pronounced as in the former ( Figure 2D ) . In agreement with these results , v - Src over - expression markedly augmented E - cad binding to p120 - cate - nin , yet reduced its interaction with b - catenin . In contrast , inhibition of Src activity by PP2 completely eliminated bind - ing of E - cad to p120 - catenin , indicating that this interaction is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter ( Lilien and Balsamo , 2005 ) ( Supplementary Figure S1D ) . Together , these data suggest that Src activity has an important function in regulating the integrity of the Par polarity and the cadherin complexes . Numb is necessary for the basolateral localization of E - cad and b - catenin in epithelial cells To investigate whether the interaction between Numb and E - cad is required for proper junctional localization of the cadherin complex , we transfected MDCKII cells with expres - sion constructs for E - cad - GFP , E - cad - ( 3F ) - GFP and E - cad - ( 3A ) - GFP , respectively . As expected , E - cad - GFP localized to cell – cell junctions in polarized cells . Of the two E - cad mutants examined , E - cad - ( 3F ) - GFP localized to the lateral membrane domain as did the wt protein . In contrast , E - cad - ( 3A ) - GFP , which was deﬁcient in Numb binding , was de - tected at the apical region of the cell – cell junction ( Figure 3A and E ) . This suggests that a physical binding between Numb and E - cad is necessary for the proper lateral membrane localization of the latter . To interrogate whether Numb is necessary for the localization of E - cad , we generated a stable clone of MDCKII in which Numb expression was ablated by a speciﬁc shRNA ( Supplementary Figure S2A and B ) . Confocal immunoﬂuorescence microscopy revealed that endogenous E - cad localized to the lateral membrane of cell – cell junction as expected . Depletion of Numb by shRNA caused a basal - to - apicolateral membrane translocation of E - cad immunoﬂuor - escence ( Figure 3B ) . However , this phenotype was comple - tely reversed by restoration of Numb expression using a construct encoding an shRNA - resistant form of Numb ( i . e . srNumb , Figure 3B and F ) . It should be noted that the effect of Numb knockdown on E - cad localization was less dramatic than observed for the E - cad ( 3A ) mutant , likely due to the effect of residual Numb in the numb - shRNA cells . Alternatively , additional factors besides Numb may be in - volved in controlling endogenous E - cad localization . As the AJ is linked to the actin cytoskeleton and the reorganization of actin network underpins the formation and maturation of cell – cell contacts ( Kametani and Takeichi , 2007 ; Hartsock and Nelson , 2008 ) , we compared F - actin staining patterns between the control and the numb - shRNA MDCK cells . Numb knockdown led to a signiﬁcant increase in F - actin staining compared with wt cells or cells expressing srNumb , suggesting that Numb is involved directly or indir - ectly in regulating actin dynamics in these cells ( Figure 3B and F ) . Furthermore , in both numb - shRNA and srNumb - expressing cells , actin stain overlapped signiﬁcantly with the E - cad immunoﬂuorescence ( Figure 3B ) . To ﬁnd out whether other AJ proteins are affected by Numb depletion , we immunostained for b - catenin , a key component of the AJ . As shown in Figure 3C and G , b - catenin underwent a similar basal - to - apicolateral translocation as E - cad in numb - shRNA cells . This defect , however , is rescued , by expression of srNumb in these cells . Together , these data show that Numb is necessary for the proper junctional localization of E - cad and b - catenin in polarized epithelial cells . It should be pointed out that Numb depletion did not affect the formation of TJs for cells polarized on transwell ﬁlters as indicated by the apical staining of ZO - 1 in numb - shRNA cells ( Figure 3D ) . As HGF treatment dissociated Numb from E - cad , we next investigated whether HGF modulated E - cad localization in numb - shRNA cells in comparison to in control MDCKII or cells expressing srNumb . In contrast to a tight junctional membrane staining signal for E - cad in polarized MDCKII cells , HGF treatment resulted in a punctate staining pattern for E - cad at the apicolateral membrane domain between adjacent cells and diffused cytosolic stain ( Figure 4A ) , sug - gesting dissolution of the AJ . Similarly , HGF induced a redistribution of Numb from the plasma membrane to the cytosol ( Figure 4A ) . Depletion of Numb in the numb - shRNA stable clones , although not affecting their ability to polarize on ﬁlters , led to an accumulation of E - cad at the apicolateral membrane domain in the absence of HGFand a redistribution of E - cad to the cytosol after HGF treatment ( Figure 4B ) . In contrast , E - cad remained largely on the junctional mem - brane in cells expressing srNumb in the presence of HGF , although the immunoﬂuorescence signal was signiﬁcantly reduced in comparison to in cells without HGF treatment ( Figure 4C ) . To ﬁnd out whether Numb depletion sensitizes cells to HGF - induced EMT , we examined , by ﬂuorescence microscopy , the localization of E - cad in subconﬂuent MDCKII or numb - shRNA cells stimulated with HGF for 0 , 6 , 12 or 18h ( Supplementary Figures S3 and S4 ) . These cells were partially polarized and therefore more sensitive to HGF treatment than a monolayer of fully polarized epithelial cells . Numb deple - tion coincided with faster dispersion of numb - shRNA cells ( e . g . at 6 h of HGF treatment ) than control cells ( e . g . at 12h of HGF treatment ) and promoted redistribution of E - cad from the membrane to the cytosol ( Supplementary Figures S3 and S4 ) . Numb differentially regulates the subcellular localization of Par3 and aPKC – Par6 during HGF - induced EMT Our biochemical data showed that Numb could be engaged in two distinct complexes with either Par3 or aPKC – Par6 , depending on the status of Src activation . To characterize these dynamic interactions in cells undergoing EMT , we followed the subcellular localization of Par3 and aPKC , respectively , in polarized monolayer of numb - shRNA stable clones before or after HGF treatment .

The apparent decou - pling of Par3 from aPKC was also observed in subconﬂuent MDCKII cells stimulated with HGF for different durations of time ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . The partially overlapped immunoﬂuorescence for Par3 and aPKC before HGF stimula - tion became discrete after exposure to HGF for 6 h when Par3 was translocated to the cytosol and nucleus while aPKC remained largely on the membrane . By 12h , Par3 was found mainly in the nucleus whereas aPKC on the membrane and in the cytosol as the cells became more elongated and scattered ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . These results suggest that decoupling of Par3 from aPKC and translocation of Par3 to the nucleus are early steps in HGF - induced EMT . Compared with HGF - induced nuclear translocation of Par3 in control MDCKII cells , both Par3 and aPKC were detected in the nuclei of polarized numb - shRNA cells in the absence of HGF ( Figure 4E ) . As Par3 was found in the nucleus of control cells only after HGF treatment , the change in subcellular localization for Par3 and aPKC caused by Numb depletion suggests that the numb - shRNA cells already acquired certain characteristics of mesenchymal cells before HGF stimulation .

We believe that the mis - localization of Par3 and aPKC in the numb - shRNA cells was caused speciﬁcally by the lack of Numb as restoration of Numb expression in the sr - Numb cells completely reversed this phenotype ( Figure 4F ) . To ensure that these immunos - taining signals observed for aPKC and Par3 were speciﬁc , we repeated the same experiments using anti - aPKC and anti - Par3 , respectively , from different sources and obtained com - parable results ( Supplementary Figures S7 and S8 ) . Moreover , the Par3 immunostaining signal was lost when the antibody was pre - incubated with a blocking antigen , suggesting that the anti - Par3 antibody used was speciﬁc ( Supplementary Figures S8B and D ) . The immunostaining patterns were corroborated by results from western blotting of cellular fractionations . As shown in Figure 5C and D , aPKC was detected in the nuclear fraction of numb - shRNA cells but not control MDCK or sr - Numb cells in the absence of HGF . Similarly , Numb knockdown led to a redistribution of Par3 from the cytosolic and membranous fractions to the nuclear fraction . In agreement with immunostaining data ( Figure 4 ) , HGF stimulation did not alter the subcellular distribution of either protein signiﬁcantly . To further explore the role of Numb in affecting the localization of aPKC and Par3 during EMT , we monitored their respective subcellular localization in a time - course of HGF treatment of subconﬂuent numb - shRNA cells . Compared with the control cells , the Numb - knockdown cells were more readily scattered on HGF stimulation . Moreover , prominent nuclear staining was observed for both aPKC and Par3 in the numb - shRNA cells , but not in the control , at 6h of HGF treatment ( Supplementary Figures S5 and S6 ) . These results suggest that Numb may regulate EMT by controlling the subcellular localization of polarity proteins . Depletion of Numb leads to weakened cell – cell adhesion and enhanced cell migration and proliferation As the above biochemical and immunoﬂuorescence data identiﬁed a critical role for Numb in the localization of both the cadherin and the Par complexes , we speculated that lack of Numb might contribute to weakened cellular junctions , reduced cell – cell adhesion , and increased cell motility . To test this hypothesis , we carried out cell aggregation and migration assays on MDCKII , numb - shRNA and sr - Numb cells . Although the control and sr - Numb - expressing cells formed aggregates that were not easily dispersed by pipetting , the numb - shRNA cells dissociate readily with the same manip - ulations ( Figure 6A and B ) . To interrogate whether Numb has a function in cell migration , we performed wounding assays on these cells , respectively . Compared with the control , Numb - knockdown promoted wound healing signiﬁcantly ( Figure 6C and D ) . Boyden chamber assays also showed a marked increase in the rate of migration for the numb - shRNA cells . Importantly , restoration of Numb expression in the sr - Numb cells returned the migration rate to the same level as the wt cells ( Figure 6E ) . To gauge the effect of cell proliferation on promoting cell migration , we measured the growth rate for each cell type . Numb - knockdown led to increased cell proliferation and re - expression of sr - Numb brought the cells back to their normal rate of growth ( Figure 6F ) . It should be noted , however , that the elevated rate of cell proliferation was insufﬁcient to account for the dramatic increase in the rate of cell migration ( i . e . at 48h post - seeding ; Figure 6E and F ) . Therefore , it is likely that the depletion of Numb had a dual effect on MDCKII cells : increased cell proliferation and enhanced cell migration because of weakened cell – cell adhesion . Discussion Numb links a tyrosine kinase signal to the cadherin and Par complexes Growth factors such as HGF , FGF and PDGF provide the necessary stimuli to trigger EMT ( Birchmeier et al , 2003 ; Avizienyte et al , 2004 ; Avizienyte and Frame , 2005 ; Wang et al , 2008 ) , but how the activation of corresponding signal - ling pathways regulate the transition of epithelial cells from a polarized monolayer to migratory mesenchymal cells during EMT is not fully understood . As loss of cell polarity and cell – cell adhesion are hallmarks of EMT , it is reasonable to assume that growth factor - initiated signalling events have an impact on the assembly or dissolution of the TJs and / or AJs . In keeping with this assumption , tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of Par3 by EGF treatment or the Src family kinases ( e . g . Src and Yes ) has an important function in regulating epithelial TJ assembly ( Wang et al , 2006 ) . It has also been shown that a receptor tyrosine kinase may directly interact with compo - nents of the Par polarity complex . For instance , activated ErbB2 is capable of binding to Par6 and thereby promotes the disassociation of the Par3 – aPKC – Par6 – CDC42 complex to disrupt epithelial polarity ( Aranda et al , 2006 ) . The identiﬁ - cation of Numb , an endocytic adaptor protein ( Santolini et al , 2000 ) as a direct binder for Par3 and aPKC , and the demon - stration that polarized Numb phosphorylation by aPKC con - tributes to directional cell migration ( Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) suggest that Numb is a regulator of epithelial polarity . This notion is reinforced by a recent study showing that Numb and Numbl are required for the maintenance of cadherin - based adhesion and polarity for neural progenitors ( Rasin et al , 2007 ) . That Numb is capable of interacting with both the Par polarity complex and E - cad raise the possibility that it may be an important regulator of both the TJ and the AJ in epithelial cells . In the present work , we investigated the role of Numb in regulating cell polarity through the Par polarity complex and cell – cell adhesion through E - cad in the context of HGF - or Src - induced EMT of MDCK cells . Our biochemical data strongly suggest that Numb is engaged in distinct protein complexes depending on the status of Src activation . In the absence of HGF stimulation or Src activation , Numb interacts with both the Par complex through binding to Par3 and the cadherin complex through E - cad in MDCK cells . In HGF - treated or v - src - transformed cells , Numb is decoupled from E - cad and Par3 and binds selectively to aPKC – Par6 . HGF signals through the receptor tyrosine kinase c - Met , which , in turn , activates both Src and the Erk mitogen - activated PK cascade ( Ponzetto et al , 1994 ) . Our observation that HGF treatment and Src activation affect the interactions mediated by Numb in a similar manner suggests that HGF signals to the TJ and AJ through the activation of Src and Src - dependent phosphorylation of junctional proteins and / or their regula - tors ( Avizienyte et al , 2002 ; Fujita et al , 2002 ; Christiansen and Rajasekaran , 2006 ) . Numb regulates epithelial polarity and cell – cell adhesion Z Wang et al The EMBO Journal VOL 28 | NO 16 | 2009 & 2009 European Molecular Biology Organization 2368 Numb has an essential function in controlling E - cad localization to the AJ How does Numb regulate the cadherens junction in epithelial cells ? We addressed this question by confocal immunoﬂuor - escence microscopy using an E - cad mutant [ E - cad ( 3A ) ] defective in Numb binding and a MDCKII clone with stable shRNA - mediated Numb knockdown , respectively . Our results indicate that Numb is necessary for the basolateral mem - brane localization of E - cad in polarized epithelial cells . Decoupling of Numb from E - cad or depletion of Numb causes E - cad to be accumulated at the apical membrane domain in the absence of a stimulus . As Numb binds to E - cad and the two proteins colocalize in polarized MDCK cells , it is likely that a physical interaction between the two proteins is involved in targeting E - cad to the basolateral membrane in polarized epithelial cells . As Numb is capable of binding to components of the endocytosis machinery ( Santolini et al , 2000 ; Dho et al , 2006 ) , it may be involved in the enodo - cytosis of E - cad . On Src activation , E - cad becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and is decoupled from Numb . Phosphory - lated E - cad has been shown to bind selectively to Hakai , an E3 ubiquitin ligase ( Fujita et al , 2002 ) . It is likely that Numb regulates the endocytosis and recycling of E - cad in resting epithelial cells , whereas Hakai promotes the ubiquitination and endocytosis of phosphorylated E - cad in response to Src activation . Together , Numb and Hakai may modulate dy - namic changes in E - cad mediated cell – cell adhesion during normal development or EMT . This model is supported by the following considerations . First , E - cad undergoes a constant turnover at the epithelial junctional membrane .

Second , Numb is an endocytic adaptor protein that can promote the endocytosis of a bound protein ( Santolini et al , 2000 ; Dho et al , 2006 ; Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) . In this regard , it is interesting to note that the PTB domain of Numb binds to a YENPTY motif present in the cytoplasmic tail of APP and promotes the endocytosis of the latter ( Roncarati et al , 2002 ) . As E - cad binds to Numb through its PTB domain , the C - terminus of Numb is free to interact with an EH domain - containing endocytic protein and / or with AP2 ( Santolini et al , 2000 ; Dho et al , 2006 ) . Third , Hakai contains a PTB domain similar to that found in Cb1 , also an E3 ligase . Interestingly , the Cbl PTB domain recognizes an [ N / D ] xxpY motif in a phosphorylation - depen - dent manner ( Lupher et al , 1997 ) ; it is therefore possible that the Hakai PTB domain binds E - cad through the NVYY site on Src activation ( to generate NVYpY ) . Indeed , Hakai has been shown to interact with E - cad in a tyrosine phosphorylation - dependent manner and thereby induce ubiquitination of E - cad . Ubiquitinated E - cad may be either degraded in the proteosome or recycled back to the membrane through the endocytic pathway ( Pece and Gutkind , 2002 ) . The potential dynamic interplay of E - cad with Numb and Hakai , which awaits further investigation , may be an important mechanism for controlling E - cad localization , trafﬁcking and EMT under physiological and pathological conditions . Notwithstanding these considerations , however , we found that E - cad was associated with AP2 in both unstimulated and Src - activated cells ( Supplementary Figure S1D ) , suggesting that AP2 may also directly regulate E - cad endocytosis independently of Numb . An important yet unsolved question from this work is how knockdown of Numb causes apical accumulation of E - cad in polarized MDCK cells in the absence of a stimulus . It is likely that actin reorganization associated with Numb depletion contribute to this phenomenon . An important function of the AJ , which is mediated by the actin cytoskeleton , is to reinforce contacts between neigh - bouring cells such that apical and basolateral membrane domains are maintained in polarized cells ( Vasioukhin et al , 2000 ; Hartsock and Nelson , 2008 ) . We observed a striking F - actin stress ﬁbre - like phenotype associated in polarized numb - shRNA cells , which suggests abnormal cytoskeleton reorganization . Intriguingly , E - cad was found to colocalize with F - actin at the apical domain in these cells . As actin polarization is controlled by the Rho family small GTPase ( Jaffe and Hall , 2005 ) , it is possible that localized RhoA or Rac activity leads to changes in the actin cytoskele - ton , which , in turn , impact on E - cad localization . Numb regulates the TJ by sequestering Par3 and aPKC away from the nucleus Our observation that the subcellular localization of Par3 and aPKC is altered in polarized numb - shRNA cells before HGF treatment strongly suggests that Numb also has an important function in regulating the stability of TJs . It is intriguing that Numb depletion caused a nuclear accumulation for aPKC independently of a kinase signal . It has been reported that aPKC may be imported into the nucleus , a process that is facilitated by tyrosine phosphorylation , in particular at the conserved Tyr263 site ( White et al , 2002 ) . When Numb is present , however , aPKC is retained on the membrane and in the cytoplasm regardless of Src activation or HGF treatment . This suggests that , rather than a tyrosine kinase signal , it is Numb that is responsible for sequestering aPKC away from the nucleus . In support of this notion , we found Numb bound to aPKC independently of Src activity . The interaction , how - ever , was enhanced signiﬁcantly in v - src - transformed or HGF - treated cells . A tighter binding of Numb to phosphorylated aPKC and the resulting sequestration of the latter in the cytosol may play an important part in delaying the process of EMT . In keeping with this consideration , Numb - depletion sensitized MDCK cells to HGF - induced EMT . Compared with aPKC , Par3 underwent nuclear translocation in both wt MDCK cells treated with HGF and in numb - shRNA cells . Once again , Numb has an important function in retain - ing Par3 in the cytosol and / or on the membrane . As the Numb – Par3 interaction was inhibited by tyrosine phosphor - ylation , stimulation of wt MDCK cells with HGF effectively created a scenario similar to that caused by Numb knockdown . What is the biological signiﬁcance of nuclear translocation for polarity proteins ? A recent study showed that Par3 loca - lized to the nucleus of Hela cells and bound to Ku70 and Ku80 , the regulatory subunits of the DNA - dependent PK ( DNA - PK ) ( Fang et al , 2007 ) . As Par3 knockdown cells are defective in DNA repair accompanied by reduced DNA - PK activity , it was suggested that Par3 has a function in regulat - ing DNA double strand break repair . The modular nature of Par3 , which contains multiple PDZ domains and interaction motifs , suggests that additional nuclear functions may exist . As Par3 underwent nuclear translocation soon ( 6h ) after HGF treatment of subconﬂuent MDCKII cells , the nuclear accumu - lation of Par3 may be an early event during HGF - induced EMT . It will be interesting and important to determine whether nuclear translocation of Par3 and other polarity proteins occurs under other types of stimuli , such as TGF - b , that are conducive to EMT ( Wang et al , 2008 ) . A model for Numb function in HGF - induced EMT Numb was recently shown to function as a tumour suppres - sor in breast cancer by protecting p53 from Mdm2 - mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation , and by antago - nizing Notch activity ( Frise et al , 1996 ; Pece et al , 2004 ; Leong and Karsan , 2006 ; Colaluca et al , 2008 ; Dotto , 2008 ) . Our work extends the function of Numb to potentially regulating tumour metastasis by delaying the progression of EMT . This assertion is supported by the observation that depletion of Numb sensitized MDCK cells to HGF - induced cell scattering , reduced cell – cell adhesion , increased cell proliferation and migration . In fact , the migration and pro - liferation data obtained for the numb - shRNA cells is in agreement with recent reports showing that Numb is down - regulated during promoted migration of peripheral glia ( Edenfeld et al , 2007 ) and that implantation of Drosophila larval neuroblasts carrying a mutation in numb triggered tumour growth in the recipient ﬂy ( Caussinus and Gonzalez , 2005 ) . Defects in subcellular localization for E - cad , b - catenin , Par3 and aPKC caused by Numb knockdown suggest an important regulatory role for Numb in cell polarity and cell – cell adhesion . Although there is no direct evidence to support a physical interaction between the AJ and elements Numb regulates epithelial polarity and cell – cell adhesion Z Wang et al The EMBO Journal VOL 28 | NO 16 | 2009 & 2009 European Molecular Biology Organization 2370 of the Par complex to date , genetic studies have indicated potential interplay between these two cell junctional units . For instance , during Drosophila embryogenesis , disruption of the AJ perturbed apical localization of Bazooka ( Par3 ) ( Muller and Wieschaus , 1996 ; Bilder et al , 2003 ) . Knockout of a - catenin in mice also led to mislocalization of Par3 and aPKC ( Lechler and Fuchs , 2005 ) . On the basis of data presented herein , we propose that Numb is a critical , dy - namic link between the TJ and the AJ under physiological and pathological conditions . Under physiological conditions , Numb interacts with both E - cad and Par3 to maintain cell polarity and stabilize cell – cell adhesion . During EMT induced by tyrosine kinase signalling , Numb dissociates from phos - phorylated E - cad and Par3 , and forms a complex with aPKC – Par6 . The formation of the Numb – aPKC – Par6 complex se - questers aPKC – Par6 in the cytoplasm and promotes the dissociation of Par3 from the latter . In the meantime , phos - phorylated E - cad and b - catenin are translocated to the apical domain along with reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton to promote cell migration ( Supplementary Figure S9 ) . Therefore , Numb likely has a key function in early EMT events when cell – cell adhesion is weakened and cell polarity is lost .

Cell culture , IP and western blots MDCKII cells ( obtained from ATCC ) and the ts - src - MDCKI cells ( a gift from Dr Ju¨rgen Behrens , Nikolaus - Fiebiger - Center for Molecular Medicine , Germany ) were maintained in DMEM medium supple - mented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 2mg / ml glutamine and 100 units of penicillin - streptomycin at 37 1 C . The ts - src - MDCKI cells were cultured in 10cm tissue culture dishes at 40 1 C for 48h before transferring to 35 1 C incubator . For western blots , cells were lysed in RIPA buffer ( 1 % NP40 , 0 . 5 % deoxycholate , 150mM sodium chloride , 25mM sodium ﬂuoride , 50mM Tris – HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) contain - ing 50mM phenyl methylsulphonyl ﬂuoride , 2 . 5mM sodium orthovanadate 2mgml (cid:2) 1 aprotinin , 0 . 1mgml (cid:2) 1 chymostatin , 1mgml (cid:2) 1 Chymostatin and 1mgml (cid:2) 1 pepstatin A . After centrifu - gation at 13000 g for 20min , the supernatant was incubated with 5 m l of a speciﬁc antibody for 1h at 4 1 C . The immunocomplex was precipitated from solution using protein G - Sepharose 4B beads and separated by SDS – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . Western blotting was performed by following published procedures ( Li et al , 2003 ) . Mutagenesis and sh - RNA - mediated knockdown E - cad variants containing mutations of Tyr752 , TyrY753 or TyrY754 to an Ala or Phe or combinations were generated by site - directed mutagenesis as described ( Li et al , 2003 ) . The resulting mutants were subcloned into the pEGFP - N1 vector for binding and localization studies . An sh - RNA - mediated knock down strategy was used to deplete Numb from MDCK cells . Speciﬁcally , shRNA , 5 0 - GGACCTCATAGTTGACCAG - 3 0 , directed against specify region of numb gene ( Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) was cloned into a pSUPER - GFP / Neo vector ( OligoEngine , WA ) . The transfection of the shRNA into MDCKII cells was carried out using Transfast ( Promega , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Four stable numb - shRNA MDCK clones were obtained with G418 selection ( 1mg / ml , Sigma , Canada ) . Among them , clone No . 2 was used for all subsequent experiments . For rescue experiments , siRNA - resistant Numb ( sr - Numb ) was generated by changing the shRNA - targeting sequence to 5 0 - GGACCTCATTGTAGACCAG - 3 0 through mutagenesis as described ( Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) . Microscopy and confocal microscopy Phase contrast images of MDCK cells and confocal ﬂuorescent images were acquired on Motic A31 with a 20 (cid:3) phase objective ( Motic , Canada ) or on a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) with a Zeiss 63 (cid:3) Plan Apochromat oil - immersion objective . Cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Sigma , Canada ) , permeabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma , Canada ) and then blocked with 5 % BSA ( Sigma , Canada ) in PBS . The intended primary antibodies ( 1 : 50 dilution ) were used as described above . The corresponding secondary antibodies ( 1 : 50 dilution ) conjugated to either FITC ( green ) or Cy3 ( red ) were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab Inc ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , PA ) . Rhodamine - phalloidin ( Sigma , Canada ) was used for F - actin staining at 1 : 50 dilution . Each staining was performed for 1h at room temperature , which was followed by 3 (cid:3) washes in PBS . Mounting medium with Dapi ( Vector Lab Inc , CA ) was used to stain nuclei . Confocal Z - stack x / y plane images were collected with 1 - m m interval in a 13 m m total depth . The x / y or x / z section images were generated from Z - Stack images with LSM Image software ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) . Images for direct comparison were obtained under identical parameters and were representative of more than 100 cells in multiple assays . Cell fractionation Preparation of cytosol , membrane and nuclear fractions was performed according to the protocol contained in the FractionPREP cell fractionation kit ( BioVision Research ) . The fractionations were conﬁrmed by immunoblotting for Tubulin ( a cytosol marker ) , Na / K - ATPase ( a plasma membrane marker ) and LaminA / C ( a nuclear marker ) , respectively . Quantiﬁcation of data and statistical analysis Western blots or immunoﬂuorescence images were converted into 8 - bit tiff images and then inverted . The background threshold was set by ImageJ ( NIH free software ) automatically . Subsequently , protein bands or cell – cell junction areas were selected and measured in ImageJ . Statistical analysis was performed with two - tailed Student’s t - test . Cell aggregation , wounding , migration and proliferation assays Cell aggregation assays were performed as described ( Thoreson et al , 2000 ) with minor modiﬁcations . Brieﬂy , conﬂuent cells were detached from culture dishes using 0 . 01 % trypsin in PBS . After incubating for 1h at 37 1 C in a 100 m l overhanging drop on lid , cells were dissociated by pipetting 10 times through a 100 - m l tip . For cell wounding and healing assays , MDCKII cells were seeded on 10cm Petri dishes with 0 . 5 million cells . Cell at 100 % conﬂuency ( at approximately 24h post - seeding ) were scratched using a 1000 m l plastic pipette tip and the cell debris were washed away . The plate of cells was then incubated for an indicated period of time in the presence of serum before imaging . The average migration distance in a wounding assay was determined by measuring the gap of the wound at different time points . Boyden chambers cell Numb regulates epithelial polarity and cell – cell adhesion Z Wang et al & 2009 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 28 | NO 16 | 2009 2371 migration assay was carried out in Transwell ( Corning Inc , NY ) 24 - well tissue culture plates . The upper chamber was seeded with 1 (cid:3) 10 4 cells in serum - free DMEM and incubated overnight . The lower chamber was replaced with 0 . 5 % FBS in DMEM the next day . Cells that migrated to the lower chamber were ﬁxed and stained in Giemsa solution ( VWR International , Canada ) . The migrating cells at the bottom of the ﬁlters were counted in four ﬁelds per ﬁlter in three independent experiments . For cell proliferation assays , aliquots of 1 (cid:3) 10 4 cells were seeded into a 96 - well plate in quadruplicates and incubated at 37 1 C for 72h . At the end of each time point , each well was loaded with 5 m l of fresh MTT ( 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazolyl - 2 ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyl tetrazolium bromide , 5mg / ml in PBS , Sigma ) and the mixture was incubated for an additional 3h . The optical absorbance at 570nm was measured using a 96 - well plate ELISA reader . Every MTTassay was conducted in triplicate .
