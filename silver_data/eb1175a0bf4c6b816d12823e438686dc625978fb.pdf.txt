Using a caveolin - 1 ( cav - 1 ) – deﬁcient cell line ( human hepatoma 7 ) and embryonic ﬁbroblasts from a cav - 1 knockout mouse , we found that in the absence of caveolae , but also in wild - type embryonic ﬁbroblasts , the virus exploits an alternative , cav - 1 – independent pathway . Internalization was rapid ( t 1 / 2 (cid:1) 20 min ) and cholesterol and tyrosine kinase dependent but independent of clathrin , S dynamin II , and ARF6 . The viruses were internalized in small , tight - ﬁtting vesicles and transported to membrane - bounded , pH - neutral organelles similar to caveosomes but devoid of cav - 1 and - 2 . The viruses were next trans - ferred by microtubule - dependent vesicular transport to the ER , a step that was required for infectivity . Our results revealed the existence of a virus - activated endocytic pathway from the plasma membrane to the ER that involves neither clathrin nor caveolae and that can be activated also in the presence of cav - 1 . Introduction In addition to clathrin - mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis , animal cells support a variety of other mechanisms for internal - izing plasma membrane components , fluid , and surface - bound ligands ( Dautry - Varsat , 2000 ; Johannes and Lamaze , 2002 ; Conner and Schmid , 2003 ; Nabi and Le , 2003 ; Nichols , 2003 ; Parton and Richards , 2003 ; Pelkmans and Helenius , 2003 ) . Some of these mechanisms involve the selective internalization of glycolipids , cholesterol , GPI - anchored proteins , lipid raft – associated receptors as well as a variety of ligands that bind to them . Such ligands include autocrine motility factor , serum albumin , cholera and shiga toxin , interleukin - 2 , and ligands that bind to GPI - anchored proteins ( Benlimame et al . , 1998 ; Lamaze et al . , 2001 ; Nichols , 2003 ; Parton and Richards , 2003 ; Peters et al . , 2003 ; Williams and Lisanti , 2004 ) . In addition to endocytosis , the nonclathrin pathways are thought to play a role in signal transduction , transcytosis , and the homeostasis of cholesterol ( Anderson , 1998 ; Simons and Ikonen , 2000 ; Simons and Toomre , 2000 ; Williams and Lisanti , 2004 ) . To learn more about these elusive processes , we use ani - mal viruses . Although many viruses enter via clathrin - coated pits and endosomes ( Marsh and Helenius , 1989 ) , some make use of clathrin - independent pathways ( Gilbert and Benjamin , 2000 ; Sieczkarski and Whittaker , 2002 ; Pelkmans and Helenius , 2003 ) . One of the viruses that enter without the help of clathrin is simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) , a simple , well - characterized , non - enveloped DNA virus that replicates in the nucleus ( Kasamatsu and Nakanishi , 1998 ) . It enters many cell types by a process that involves cell surface caveolae ( Anderson et al . , 1996 ; Norkin , 2001 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ; Parton and Richards , 2003 ) . Caveolae are lipid raft – enriched , flask - shaped plasma mem - brane indentations stabilized by caveolins , which are cho - lesterol - binding , integral membrane proteins ( Rothberg et al . , 1992 ) . Caveolae occur in cells that express either caveo - lin - 1 ( cav - 1 ) or its muscle cell – specific homologue , caveolin - 3 . They give caveolae their characteristic size and indented shape ( Fra et al . , 1995 ) . Whereas caveolae are present at high concen - trations on adipocytes , muscle cells , and endothelial cells , there are few caveolae in hepatocytes and none in neuronal cells and lymphocytes ( Drab et al . , 2001 ; Lamaze et al . , 2001 ; Vainio et al . , 2002 ) . Most cell surface caveolae show limited motility and dynamics ( Thomsen et al . , 2002 ) . However , when triggered by an appropriate ligand such as SV40 , activation of tyrosine ki - Correspondence to Ari Helenius : ari . helenius @ bc . biol . ethz . ch Abbreviations used in this paper : AF , Alexafluor ; BFA , Brefeldin A ; cav - 1 , caveolin - 1 ; cav - 1WT , cav - 1 wild - type ; HuH7 , human hepatoma 7 ; KO , knock - out ; LY , Lucifer yellow ; MOI , multiplicity of infection ; SFV , Semliki Forest virus ; SV40 , simian virus 40 ; Tf , transferrin .

Like clathrin - mediated endocytosis , caveolar vesicle for - mation involves recruitment of dynamin II , a GTPase involved in the final stage of vesicle scission ( De Camilli et al . , 1995 ; Oh et al . , 1998 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ) . Although some of the caveo - lar ligands are sorted to endosomes and the Golgi complex after internalization ( Parton and Richards , 2003 ) , many are trans - ported to caveosomes ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ; Nichols , 2003 ; Peters et al . , 2003 ) . These are cav - 1 – positive , pH - neutral or - ganelles distinct from compartments of the classical endocytic and exocytic pathways . From caveosomes , SV40 is transported by a microtubule - mediated process to the ER , where penetration into the cytosol is thought to occur ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ) . From the cytosol , the virus particles enter the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes ( Kasamatsu and Nakanishi , 1998 ) . We have analyzed what happens when SV40 is added to cells devoid of caveolae . We found that the virus entered by an al - ternative tyrosine kinase – and cholesterol - dependent endocytic pathway , and the cells were infected . The pathway differed from the caveolar pathway in that it was rapid and dynamin II indepen - dent . It bypassed the classical endocytic organelles and delivered the virus via nonendosomal , cytosolic organelles to the ER . In wild - type mouse embryonic fibroblasts , the virus apparently used the same dynamin II – independent uptake pathway with a major fraction of viruses internalized independently of cav - 1 . The re - sults provided information about an endocytic cholesterol - depen - dent pathway that can exist in parallel with the caveolar pathway . Both pathways apparently merge at the level of caveosomes . Results SV40 infects cells devoid of caveolae We used two types of cav - 1 – deficient cells : primary embryonic fibroblasts derived from cav - 1 knockout ( KO ) mice ( cav - 1KO cells ; Drab et al . , 2001 ) and a human hepatoma cell line ( hu - man hepatoma 7 [ HuH7 ] ) , also devoid of cav - 1 ( Vainio et al . , 2002 ) . Western blots confirmed that , in contrast to embryonic fibroblasts from a wild - type mouse ( cav - 1 wild - type [ cav - 1WT ] cells ) , neither CV - 1 or MDCK cells contained detectable cav - 1 ( Fig . S1 A , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200407113 / DC1 ) . Although showing no cav - 1 staining in the cav - 1KO cells , and only weak background staining in HuH7 cells , immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy re - vealed that both cell lines contained cav - 2 in the Golgi com - plex ( Fig . S1 B ) . This observation was consistent with reports that association with cav - 1 is necessary for the transport of cav - 2 to peripheral sites ( Parolini et al . , 1999 ) . Although present in caveolae , cav - 2 alone is not able to form caveolae . To test whether or not the cells could be infected , they were incubated with SV40 , and after 20 h subjected to immu - nofluorescence using an antibody against T - antigen , a viral protein synthesized early in infection . The results showed that a large fraction of the cells expressed the viral protein ( Fig . 1 A ) and that there was essentially no difference in infection be - tween cav - 1WT and cav - 1KO cells . In comparison , CV - 1 cells , which are cav - 1 – positive kidney cells from the natural host of SV40 ( the African green monkey ) , are infected 10 times more efficiently ( Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ) . To stay in the linear range Figure 1 . Cav - 1KO and HuH7 cells internalize SV40 and are infected .

Cells were incubated at 4 (cid:2) C for 2 h and shifted to 37 (cid:2) C in the continuous pres - ence of the virus . At the indicated time points , cells were analyzed for the amount of internal - ized virus ( Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ) .

SV40 endocytosis in the absence of caveolae Thin section electron microscopy after incubation with SV40 for 15 min at 37 (cid:2) C showed that the virus was internalized by tight - fitting vesicles ( 60 - nm diameter ) similar to SV40 - con - taining vesicles in CV - 1 cells ( Kartenbeck et al . , 1989 ) . How - ever , the particles did not seem to enter preexisting , caveolar - sized pits but rather indentations that seemed to progressively adopt the rounded shape of the virus with the membrane tightly associated with the surface of the virus ( Fig . 1 B ) . The viruses did not associate with clathrin - coated pits . To characterize the internalization process by light micros - copy , and to quantify it biochemically , two assays were used ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 , 2002 ) . First , fluorescein - labeled SV40 ( FITC - SV40 ) was added to cells in the cold , and after washing and raising the temperature to 37 (cid:2) C , the fate of the bound virus particles was determined by confocal microscopy . To distinguish between internalized and noninternalized particles , the pH in the extracellular medium was lowered to 4 . This quenched the FITC - fluorescence of noninternalized particles and allowed detection of internalized viruses in organelles of neutral pH ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ) . The results showed that already after 5 – 10 min at 37 (cid:2) C , a large fraction of the FITC - SV40 had been internalized . Fluorescence could be seen in small spots throughout the cyto - plasm ( Fig . 1 C , c and d ) . Acid quenching without prior warming resulted in the complete loss of fluorescence ( Fig . 1 C , b ) . The second assay made use of 125 I - and biotin - coupled virus particles and a membrane - impermeable reducing agent to remove the biotin from exposed virions ( Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ) . The re - sults showed that SV40 internalization into cav - 1KO cells started immediately after warming , proceeding rapidly with a t 1 / 2 of 20 (cid:4) 3 min and reaching maximum ( 95 % ) within an hour ( Fig . 1 D ) . Uptake was considerably faster than in CV - 1 cells ( t 1 / 2 (cid:1) 101 (cid:4) 11 min ) . When the same assay was applied to cav - 1WT cells , the uptake was found to be equally efficient as in the cav - 1KO cells but the t 1 / 2 was considerably longer ( t 1 / 2 (cid:1) 98 (cid:4) 15 min ) . A clathrin - , dynamin II – , and ARF6 - independent mechanism Expression of dominant - negative Eps15 ( E (cid:5) 95 / 295 ) , which in - terferes with clathrin - coated pit assembly ( Benmerah et al . , 1999 ) , did not inhibit infection of cav - 1KO ( Fig . 2 B ) or HuH7 cells ( Fig . S2 B , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200407113 / DC1 ) . Nor was internalization of Alexa - fluor ( AF ) 594 - SV40 into cav - 1WT , cav - 1KO , or HuH7 cells Figure 2 . Internalization and infection of SV40 occurs independently of Eps15 , Dynamin II , and ARF6 . Cav - 1KO and cav - 1WT cells were transfected with Eps15III (cid:5) 2 ( Eps15 ctrl ) , Eps15 E (cid:5) 95 / 295 ( Eps15 mt ) , Dyn2wt , or Dyn2K44A , all tagged with GFP .

( C ) Cav - 1KO cells were cotransfected with ARF6 wild type , ARF6 T27N , ARF6 Q67L , and GFP . After transfection , cells were infected with SV40 for 20 h , fixed , and analyzed for infec - tion . Infection in cells expressing the wild - type construct was set at 100 % . Values are given as the mean (cid:4) SD . Alternatively , cells were incu - bated with AF594 - SV40 for 1 . 5 h and imaged live . As a positive control , ARF6 Q67L - GFP – transfected cells were incubated with cholera toxin - AF568 , fixed , and immunostained with an anti - giantin antibody ( blue ) . Bars , 10 (cid:3) m . JCB • VOLUME 168 • NUMBER 3 • 2005 480 impaired , although internalization of AF568 - labeled transferrin ( Tf ) , a marker for clathrin - mediated uptake , was dramatically reduced ( Fig . 2 A and Fig . S2 A ) . This result indicated that SV40 did not depend on clathrin for endocytosis . Dynamin II is involved in the formation of both clathrin - coated and caveolar vesicles ( De Camilli et al . , 1995 ; Oh et al . , 1998 ) . Expression of a dominant - negative dynamin II mutant ( dyn2K44A ; Fish et al . , 2000 ) inhibits SV40 internalization as well as infection in CV - 1 cells by 80 % ( Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ) . However , when dyn2K44A was expressed in cav - 1KO and HuH7 cells neither SV40 internalization nor infection were af - fected ( Fig . 2 , A and B ; and Fig . S2 , A and B ) . Strikingly , SV40 internalization was also unaffected in cav - 1WT cells ex - pressing dyn2K44A . As expected , we observed virtually com - plete inhibition of Tf internalization in these cell lines ( Fig . 2 A and Fig . S2 A ) . We concluded that SV40 uptake in caveolin - deficient cells occurred by clathrin - independent mechanisms , and that , in contrast to caveolar internalization in CV - 1 cells , dynamin II was not required for SV40 uptake into cav - 1WT , cav - 1KO , and HuH7 cells . ARF6 has been described to be an important factor in the clathrin - and caveolae - independent endocytosis of MHC class I , IL2 receptor (cid:6) subunit ( Tac ) , carboxypeptidase E , and the GPI - anchored protein CD59 ( Arnaoutova et al . , 2003 ; Naslavsky et al . , 2003 , 2004 ) . Neither expression of a constitu - tively active ARF6 mutant ( ARF6 Q67L ) nor of the constitu - tively inactive form ( ARF6 T27N ) in cav - 1KO cells inhibited SV40 infection ( Fig . 2 C ) . Internalization of SV40 was also not affected ( Fig . 2 C ) . It was recently reported that ARF6 is re - quired for cholera toxin transport to the Golgi in cav - 1KO cells ( Kirkham , M . , A . Fujita , S . J . Nixon , T . V . Kurzchalia , J . F . Han - cock , R . G . Parton . European Life Scientist Organization Meet - ing . 2004 . 542 ) . Therefore , as a control , ARF6 Q67L – express - ing cav - 1KO cells were incubated with cholera toxin - AF568 for 45 min , fixed , and immunostained with an anti - giantin anti - body . Whereas in untransfected control cells cholera toxin Figure 3 .

( A ) HuH7 and cav - 1KO cells were either left untreated ( control ) or pretreated with the indicated drugs and incubated with SV40 for 2 h in the presence of drugs . Virus was removed and cells were further incubated either in the presence of drugs or as a control after drug washout ( MOI 10 (cid:7) wash in HuH7 and MOI 30 (cid:7) wash in cav - 1KO cells ) . 20 h after infection , cells were analyzed for expression of T - antigen . Values are given as the mean (cid:4) SD . ( B ) Cav - 1KO cells were pretreated with nystatin / progesterone , genistein , or BFA and incubated with FITC - SV40 for 1 h .

The effect of inhibitors To investigate the role of other cellular components , we made use of inhibitors known to affect endocytic processes . Cav - 1KO or HuH7 cells were pretreated with the drug , exposed to SV40 in the continued presence of the drug , and fixed after 20 h incubation . The fraction of cells expressing T - antigen was determined and compared with untreated control cells . To con - firm that drug - induced effects were reversible , we assayed SV40 infectivity after drug wash - out at 20 h . Combined cholesterol depletion by nystatin and inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by progesterone resulted in an almost complete infection block ( Fig . 3 A ) . Genistein ( a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) and nocodazole ( a microtubule - dissociating drug ) also reduced infection dramatically . Brefeldin A ( BFA ) , a drug af - fecting the activation of Arf1 , induced a complete block of infec - tion in HuH7 cells . The results suggested that infection of cells devoid of caveolae required cholesterol , tyrosine kinases , Arf1 , and a functional microtubule skeleton . That nystatin / progester - one , BFA , and genistein caused inhibition of virus internaliza - tion was shown by the FITC - based internalization assay ; after 1 h of incubation at 37 (cid:2) C , FITC - SV40 could still be quenched by lowering extracellular pH in drug - treated cav - 1KO cells ( Fig . 3 B ) . Latrunculin A , an actin monomer - sequestering drug , did not have any influence on SV40 infection in HuH7 cells and reduced infectivity in cav - 1KO cells by 50 % . To show that Latrunculin A disassembled filamentous actin , cav - 1KO and HuH7 cells were stained with rhodamine - phalloidin ( Fig . S3 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200407113 / DC1 ) . Amiloride , a Na (cid:7) / H (cid:7) channel blocker that inhibits macropinocytosis , also did not affect infection . An intermediate organelle When the distribution of internalized AF594 - SV40 was visual - ized using confocal microscopy , the viruses could be observed in discrete spots of variable sizes and shapes distributed throughout the cytoplasm ( Fig . 4 A and Fig . S4 , A and B , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200407113 / DC1 ) . Typically , Figure 4 . SV40 - containing organelles are distinct from organelles of the classical endo - somal pathway .

SV40 - carrying vesicles did not contain markers specific for clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis . The same was shown by immuno - fluorescence of fixed cav - 1KO cells ( third row ) incubated with AF594 - SV40 and stained with the early endosomal marker EEA1 ( green ) . In cav - 1KO cells incubated with AF594 - SV40 and the fluid phase marker Lucifer yellow ( LY ) , only a minor portion of SV40 - carrying vesicles contained LY ( fourth row ) . Bars , 10 (cid:3) m .

Values are given as the mean (cid:4) SD . ( C ) Thin section electron micrographs of cav - 1KO and HuH7 cells showing virus parti - cles in intermediate organelles that resemble caveosomes . JCB • VOLUME 168 • NUMBER 3 • 2005 482 there were more than 100 such spots per cell . Thin section elec - tron microscopy showed that the viruses were localized in mem - brane - bounded organelles of irregular shape ( Fig . 4 C ) . The virus particles were still attached to the limiting membrane over a large part of their surface . Video microscopy after internalization of AF594 - SV40 showed that although the organelles underwent continuous local motion , they behaved like caveosomes in that they seldom moved long distances ( Videos 1 and 2 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200407113 / DC1 ) . About 2 h after filling up with viruses , the organelles became more dynamic , undergoing fusion and releasing virus - filled vesicles ( Videos 3 and 4 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200407113 / DC1 ) . The dynamic phase lasted until (cid:1) 3 . 5 h af - ter warming . To determine the relationship between the virus - contain - ing organelles and other endocytic structures , we internalized AF488 - Tf and AF594 - Semliki Forest virus ( SFV ) together with AF594 - SV40 and AF488 - SV40 , respectively . Tf and SFV are known to be internalized via clathrin - mediated endocytosis into endosomes . The overlap between SV40 and Tf was almost nonexistent in both cell types ( Fig . 4 , A and B ; and Fig . S4 A ) . When quantified , it was found to be 6 . 4 % in cav - 1KO and 6 . 9 % in HuH7 cells , which is probably close to background . In a control , internalization of AF488 - Tf for 5 min followed by immunostaining against EEA1 showed 40 . 3 % overlap in cav - 1KO and 39 . 2 % overlap in HuH7 cells ( Fig . 4 B , first two col - umns ) . Two fluorescent fluid - phase markers , Lucifer yellow ( LY ) and AF594 - 10K Dextran , were also allowed to be inter - nalized together with the AF594 - SV40 . Again the overlap was negligible ( Fig . 4 , A and B ; and Fig . S4 ) . Indirect immunofluo - rescence and confocal microscopy showed that the major por - tion of SV40 - containing vesicles lacked EEA1 , a marker of early endosomes ( Fig . 4 , A and B ; and Fig . S4 A ) . The overlap remained at equally low levels when SV40 was chased with these endocytic markers up to 4 h . Also in cav - 1WT cells there was no considerable overlap of internalized SV40 with the en - dosomal markers SFV , Tf , and LY ( Fig . S4 B ) . To exclude that the virus - containing vesicles constitute invaginations connected to the plasma membrane , we made use of FITC - quenching as described for Fig . 1 C . HuH7 cells were incubated with FITC - SV40 for 2 h , and the pH of the extracel - lular medium was lowered to 4 to quench the fluorescence of noninternalized viruses ( Fig . S4 C , b ) . Although the fluores - cence was reduced partially , there were numerous FITC - SV40 – containing vesicles that continued to be brightly fluo - rescent . When added to the low pH medium , the ionophores monensin and nigericin ( 10 (cid:3) M each ) equilibrated extra - and intracellular pH , resulting in an almost complete loss of fluo - rescence of internalized vesicles ( Fig . S4 C , c ) . We concluded that the virus accumulated in organelles that were disconnected from the plasma membrane and had a nonacidic pH . Association with detergent - resistant membranes The sensitivity of infection to cholesterol depletion suggested that internalization might involve cholesterol - and sphingolipid - rich microdomains , i . e . , so - called lipid rafts . To approach this possibility , we performed Triton X - 100 extraction of cells ex - posed to AF488 - SV40 and AF568 - Tf at 4 (cid:2) C either immediately after binding the ligands to the plasma membrane in the cold or after shifting to 37 (cid:2) C for various periods of time . The rationale was that cholesterol - and sphingolipid - rich membrane domains are more resistant to Triton X - 100 solubilization at reduced tem - peratures than nonraft membranes ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ) . Confocal microscopy showed that Triton X - 100 extrac - tion of unfixed HuH7 , cav - 1KO , and cav - 1WT cells on cover - slips completely extracted the AF568 - Tf , a ligand bound to a receptor that does not associate with detergent - resistant mem - Figure 5 . Association of SV40 with deter - gent - insoluble membranes . ( A ) Internalized SV40 but not Tf is resistant to Triton X - 100 extraction at 4 (cid:2) C . AF488 - SV40 and AF568 - Tf were bound to HuH7 ( left ) , cav - 1KO ( middle ) , and cav - 1WT cells ( right ) on ice and allowed to internalize for the indicated times .

Cav - 1KO cells were incubated with SV40 for 30 min at 37 (cid:2) C before cell lysis and extraction with 1 % Triton X - 100 at 4 (cid:2) C . Samples were floated in a linear sucrose gradient , and fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotted against SV40 . CAVEOLIN - 1 – INDEPENDENT ENDOCYTOSIS OF SV40 • DAMM ET AL . 483 branes ( Lamaze et al . , 2001 ) . However , AF488 - SV40 remained unextracted , both in the plasma membrane at 4 (cid:2) C and in intra - cellular structures after warming for 10 , 30 , 60 , and 240 min . Even after 16 h , a large fraction of the AF488 - SV40 was still detergent resistant ( Fig . 5 A ) . We concluded that AF488 - SV40 was bound to detergent - resistant membranes already in the cold , and remained associated with such structures during and after internalization . The detergent resistance of cell - associated SV40 was confirmed by flotation in sucrose gradients after Triton X - 100 solubilization of cav - 1KO cells ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ) . When the gradient fractions were subjected to SDS - PAGE and to blotting with antibodies against VP1 , the major SV40 coat protein , it was found that the virus had floated to a density of 1 . 068 – 1 . 090 g / cm 3 ( Fig . 5 B ) . The results indicated that soon after binding to the plasma membrane , SV40 associated with detergent - resistant membrane domains . It was then internalized in association with them , and remained associated in the intermediate organelles and beyond . Microtubule - dependent transport to the ER The cytosolic , AF488 - SV40 - loaded organelles became more dynamic when viewed 2 – 3 . 5 h after virus uptake ( Video 3 ) . Vi - rus - filled protrusions and tubules formed on their surface , some of these dissociated , giving rise to vesicles and tubular carriers that could be seen to move along linear pathways through the cytoplasm ( Fig . 6 A and Video 4 ) . The speed of movement of the vesicles was 0 . 143 (cid:4) 0 . 03 (cid:3) m / s . When the cells were trans - fected with YFP - (cid:6) - tubulin , and viewed live by confocal mi - croscopy , it could be seen that the vesicles moved along mi - crotubules ( Videos 3 and 4 ) . When cells were treated with nocodazole to disassemble the microtubules , AF594 - SV40 was internalized normally but accumulated in cytoplasmic or - ganelles that did not undergo surface changes , and did not sup - port further vesicle traffic ( Fig . 6 B and Video 5 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200407113 / DC1 ) . The organelles in which the virus accumulated were larger than the intermediate organelles in control cells ( 1 . 5 – 2 (cid:3) m in diameter compared with 0 . 5 (cid:3) m ) . They were often round and clustered in the perinuclear cytoplasm . Like in caveolin - containing cells , a large fraction of the viruses slowly found their way to the ER where they colocal - ized with syntaxin 17 , a smooth ER marker ( Steegmaier et al . , 2000 ; Fig . 7 A and Fig . S5 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200407113 / DC1 ) . Colocalization with syntaxin 17 was obvious after 8 h , and extensive after 16 h . Some vesi - cles also stained positive for the ER markers calnexin ( Fig . 7 A ) and protein disulfide isomerase ( Fig . S5 ) . The increase in overlap with syntaxin 17 with time was probably due to in - creased synthesis of this marker protein induced by the virus . This was visible as increased syntaxin 17 immunofluorescence from 8 to 16 h , and it correlated with the expansion of the smooth ER observed by EM . No significant overlap with the Golgi markers mannosidase II ( Fig . 7 A ) and membrin ( Fig . S5 ) was observed at any time . Thin section electron micros - copy of cav - 1KO cells showed accumulation of virus particles in large reticular networks of the smooth ER ( Fig . 7 B ) . Similar SV40 - induced expansions of the smooth ER arising after pro - longed incubation with SV40 were previously described in CV - 1 cells ( Kartenbeck et al . , 1989 ) . Figure 6 . Endocytosis of SV40 into cav - 1 – deficient cells results in the accumulation of virus in cytosolic organelles . Cav - 1KO cells were transfected with YFP - (cid:6) - tubulin and incubated with AF594 - SV40 for the indicated times . Before virus addition , cells had either been treated with noco - dazole ( B ) or left untreated ( A ) . Movies were recorded by confocal live microscopy of which a series of frames is shown . In nocodazole - treated cells , virus accumulated in caveosome - like organelles , which remained stationary . In A , a series of frames of untreated cells shows the formation of virus - containing transport vesicles from a larger cytosolic organelle . Bars , 5 (cid:3) m . JCB • VOLUME 168 • NUMBER 3 • 2005 484 In summary , we found that microtubules were not re - quired for internalization or initial targeting of incoming virus - carrying vesicles to the intermediate organelle . However , they were essential for the formation of transport vesicles in these organelles , and for the transport of SV40 to the ER . If present in large numbers , the viruses induced expansion of the smooth ER network . Effects of cav - 1 expression When expressed in cells that lack it , cav - 1 induces the forma - tion of caveolae ( Fra et al . , 1995 ) . Therefore , it was of interest to determine what would happen to SV40 entry and infection when cav - 1 was expressed in cav - 1KO cells . To be able to vi - sualize the caveolae and caveosomes in live cells , we used cav - 1 tagged with fluorescent protein at the COOH terminus . We have previously shown that tagged caveolin , when expressed at moderate levels , colocalizes with cav - 1 without compromising caveolar function ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ) . Caveolar dynamics can be normally activated by phosphatase inhibitors and SV40 ( unpublished data ) . Furthermore , cycles of internalization and fusion of caveolae with the plasma membrane are observed by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( unpublished data ) . Accordingly , we found that cav - 1 - mRFP was distributed in a pattern similar to that observed in most cav - 1 – positive cells ; in addition to numerous small spots on the cell surface , there was cav - 1 - mRFP in cytoplasmic organelles resembling caveosomes . When exposed to SV40 , the cells expressing cav - 1 - mRFP were infected at the same level of efficiency as cells transfected with mRFP alone . When measured 10 min after warming , 1 out of 10 of in - coming AF488 - SV40 colocalized with cav - 1 - mRFP in cav - 1 – expressing cav - 1KO cells ( Fig . 8 A , a and c ; and Video 6 , avail - able at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200407113 / DC1 ) . In the video recordings , we observed immobile virus particles on the cell surface , some colocalizing with cav - 1 - mRFP , others not . In addition , there were particles that disappeared from the mem - brane presumably by endocytosis . Some of these were associated with cav - 1 - mRFP ( Fig . 8 B ) . In the cytoplasm , overlap was seen in small , mobile vesicles ( Fig . 8 A , a , arrowheads ) , and increas - ingly with time in larger periplasmic structures that resembled caveosomes in localization , motility , size , and shape . That the fraction of viruses that colocalized with cav - 1 - mRFP increased to more than 57 % at 70 min ( Fig . 8 A , b and c ; and Video 7 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200407113 / DC1 ) was due to their localization in these caveosomes . Confo - cal live microscopy confirmed that after internalization the vi - ruses entered cav - 1 – positive organelles resembling caveosomes . We concluded that expression of cav - 1 - mRFP resulted in the for - mation of cell surface caveolae and caveosomes , that the viruses used both cav - 1 – containing and caveolin - free primary endocytic vesicles , and that the majority of viruses were transported to cav - 1 – containing intracellular organelles comparable to caveosomes . Also , in cav - 1WT cells expressing cav - 1 - mRFP , only a small fraction of virus particles colocalized initially with cav - Figure 7 . 18 h after internalization , SV40 accumulates in the smooth ER . ( A ) Cav - 1KO cells were incubated with AF594 - SV40 , fixed after 18 h , stained in indirect immunofluores - cence with a Golgi marker ( ManII , mannosi - dase II ) , an ER marker ( CNX , Calnexin ) , and a marker for the smooth ER ( Syn17 , syntaxin 17 ) , and analyzed by confocal microscopy . Histograms show colocalization of SV40 with the respective markers over time . Values are given as the mean (cid:4) SD . Bars , 10 (cid:3) m .

CAVEOLIN - 1 – INDEPENDENT ENDOCYTOSIS OF SV40 • DAMM ET AL . 485 1 - mRFP ( Fig . 8 A , d and f ) . With time , the fraction again in - creased as the viruses reached the caveosomes . Consistent with the slower endocytosis ( Fig . 1 D ) , the increase in colo - calization was less rapid than on the corresponding cav - 1KO cells . ( Fig . 8 A , f ) . Delivery of individual virus particles in cav - 1 – negative carriers to caveosomes could be observed by video microscopy ( Fig . 8 A , e ; and Video 8 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200407113 / DC1 ) . Thus , it was clear that both cav - 1WT and cav - 1KO cells possessed a cav - 1 – independent pathway that was available for virus en - docytosis and was actively used by the virus as an alternative to caveolar endocytosis . Discussion It is apparent that SV40 can enter and infect cells by multiple pathways . One is the previously described pathway that in - volves cell surface caveolae ( Parton and Lindsay , 1999 ; Nor - kin , 2001 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2001 , 2002 ) and one described here that is independent of caveolae and cav - 1 . In cav - 1 – containing cells , such as mouse embryonic lung fibroblasts , the two path - ways seem to coexist and complement each other . Both path - ways are strictly cholesterol dependent , and endocytic vesicle formation is in both cases triggered by virus - induced signals that involve activation of tyrosine kinases . The viruses are in - ternalized in small , tight fitting endocytic vesicles that look and behave similarly whether they contain caveolin or not . They deliver the viruses to pH - neutral , intermediate organelles distributed throughout the cytoplasm . In caveolin - containing cells , these organelles are the previously described caveosomes ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ) . In caveolin - free cells , the correspond - ing organelles are devoid of caveolar domains , but resemble caveosomes in their over - all distribution , their neutral lumenal pH , their lack of endosomal markers and ligands , and their acti - vation upon SV40 internalization . In fact , the part of the path - way that involves caveosome activation and microtubule - medi - ated transport of vesicles to the smooth ER appears identical for both modes of entry . Figure 8 .

JCB • VOLUME 168 • NUMBER 3 • 2005 486 In this work , we have characterized the caveolin - indepen - dent process by following SV40 entry and infection in cells de - void of caveolae . We found that internalization and infection were cholesterol dependent but independent of clathrin , dy - namin II , and ARF6 . Although distinguished by faster kinetics , cav - 1 – independent internalization resembled cav - 1 – mediated uptake in many of its over - all characteristics . The low level of fluid phase uptake and the inhibition by genistein indicated that internalization did not occur by a continuous but rather by a transient virus - activated process . Clearly , both endocytic pro - cesses fell into the category of mechanisms triggered by the cargo and involving a local signal . To induce internalization in cav - 1KO cells , the viruses had to associate with cholesterol - and sphingolipid - rich lipid micro - domains ( i . e . , lipid rafts ) . We found that the viruses were rapidly included in a detergent - resistant membrane fraction in which they remained during the rest of the entry process . The viruses either entered preexisting lipid rafts immediately after attach - ment , or , more likely , induced the formation of such domains by multivalent association with ganglioside molecules in the mem - brane . When clustered , GM1 is known to partition effectively into lipid rafts and to be trapped in caveolae ( Parton , 1994 ) . Electron microscopy of cells devoid of caveolae showed that the SV40 particles were internalized via small plasma membrane pits and vesicles devoid of visible coats . The viruses were transported to pH - neutral organelles that resembled ca - veosomes except that they did not contain cav - 1 or - 2 . Judging by their detergent insolubility , they were rich in raft lipids . 2 to 3 h after arrival of the viruses , live cell microscopy showed that the intermediate compartments became much more dynamic , and virus - containing transport vesicles and tu - bular carriers were formed . The generation of such transport vesicles , and the propagation of their movement from the inter - mediate organelle to the ER , was microtubule dependent and essential for infection . The virus particles later accumulated in tubular networks of the smooth ER . As a consequence of virus internalization , the networks grew in size and complexity . The accumulation of viruses induced increased expression of syn - taxin 17 , a smooth ER marker . Whereas SV40 uptake in CV - 1 and cav - 1WT cells shows a t 1 / 2 of (cid:1) 100 min ( Fig . 1 D ; Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ) , initial uptake in cav - 1KO cells had a t 1 / 2 of only 20 min . Thus , the kinetics of uptake was clearly faster in cells devoid of cav - 1 . Nabi and Le ( 2003 ) have proposed that caveolar and caveolin - independent processes constitute a common endocytosis system in which the role of the caveolae is to slow down endocytosis by stabilizing lipid rafts . In other words , although there is no doubt that caveo - lae themselves can internalize if properly activated , their main function in endocytosis may be to suppress rapid internalization of lipid rafts and raft - ligands . Although internalization of a major portion of SV40 was caveolae independent in cav - 1WT cells , the kinetics of uptake were comparable to caveolar endocytosis in CV - 1 cells . This result may be explained by sequestration of lipid microdomains into nonactivated caveolae , slowing down virus internalization by the faster alternative pathway . Another significant difference between CV - 1 cells ( Pelk - mans et al . , 2002 ) and HuH7 , cav - 1WT , and cav - 1KO cells was the inability of the GTPase - deficient mutant of dynamin II to reduce SV40 endocytosis and infection . One possible reason why dynamin II might be dispensable during SV40 entry into cells devoid of caveolae is that alternative cellular factors are used to form these vesicles . There is already evidence that en - docytic pathways do not all rely on dynamin II . The dynamin - independent pathways reported include an ARF6 - dependent process that internalizes not only non - raft proteins such as Class I MHC antigens but also some raft - associated proteins such as CD59 from the cell surface to endosomes ( Arnaoutova et al . , 2003 ; Naslavsky et al . , 2003 ) . The internalization of non - clustered GPI - anchored proteins to endosomes has also been reported to be dynamin II independent , but , in contrast to SV40 endocytosis , it is ARF6 dependent ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ; Naslavsky et al . , 2004 ) . Moreover , polyomavirus has been re - ported to enter NIH - 3T3 cells by a pathway that is dynamin I , clathrin , and cav - 1 independent , but this pathway was not af - fected by cholesterol depletion ( Gilbert and Benjamin , 2000 ) . The presence of two distinct mechanisms for SV40 endocy - tosis raises several questions of general nature . How many clath - rin - independent mechanisms and pathways are there ? To what extent do they overlap mechanistically and functionally ? What is their cargo and how is it sorted and distributed intracellularly ? In trying to answer these questions , it is clear from our re - sults and data from other systems that there are multiple choles - terol - dependent and clathrin - and cav - 1 – independent mecha - nisms . Several reports describe a rapid , caveolin - independent , but dynamin - dependent pathway involved in the formation of small , noncoated vesicles at the plasma membrane ( Benlimame et al . , 1998 ; Dautry - Varsat , 2000 ; Le et al . , 2002 ; Nabi and Le , 2003 ; Nichols , 2003 ; Parton and Richards , 2003 ) . In cells that have caveolae , this pathway coexists with the caveolar pathway , and the two have overlapping functions . In cells that do not have caveolae , the same dynamin - dependent pathway may at least in part replace caveolar endocytosis functionally ( Nabi and Le , 2003 ) . Interleukin - 2 and cholera toxin are internalized by this mechanism in Caco - 2 cells , lymphocytes , and Jurkat lymphoma cells that all lack caveolae and in Cos - 7 cells where cav - 1 ex - pression was reduced with RNAi ( Lamaze et al . , 2001 ; Nichols , 2002 ) . Autocrine motility factor is similarly internalized in transformed NIH - 3T3 cells that contain little caveolin and few surface caveolae ( Benlimame et al . , 1998 ; Le et al . , 2002 ) . The functional redundancy in cholesterol - dependent en - docytosis revealed by SV40 entry into cells devoid of caveolae may help to explain why cav - 1KO mice in the genetic back - ground used here survive and display relatively minor physio - logical defects ( Drab et al . , 2001 ; Razani et al . , 2002 ) . Many processes thought to depend on caveolae , such as transcytosis in endothelia , cholesterol homeostasis , and the organization of lipid rafts , are essentially unimpaired in these mice ( Kurzchalia and Parton , 1999 ; Simons and Ikonen , 2000 ; Simons and Toomre , 2000 ) . It is possible that caveolar functions in the KO mice are taken over by caveolin - independent pathways such as the one used by SV40 in the cav - 1KO cells derived from these mice . That alternative pathways may be up - regulated when cav - 1 is lost , is suggested by knock - down experiments using iRNA that indicate that rapid depletion ( (cid:8) 24 h ) of cav - 1 CAVEOLIN - 1 – INDEPENDENT ENDOCYTOSIS OF SV40 • DAMM ET AL . 487 mRNA reduces SV40 infection and is toxic to cells in contrast to slower reduction , in which case alternative pathways may have more time to be induced ( unpublished data ) . It is clear that cells have multiple , parallel mechanisms and pathways for internalizing lipid raft components and asso - ciated molecules . These participate in the regulation of the plasma membrane composition by selective sequestration of specific membrane constituents and ligands associated with them . The various caveolae / raft pathways are tyrosine kinase activated , pH neutral , and they largely by - pass endosomes and lysosomes . They are so similar in important respects that it is tempting to view them as variants of a common process . How - ever , they differ in internalization rate , involvement of caveo - lae , and role of cytosolic proteins such as dynamin and actin . Moreover , different cell types seem to have distinct preferences in respect to mechanisms that they make use of . The main chal - lenge will be to characterize the molecular mechanisms in - volved and to analyze these pathways using a variety of cellu - lar systems and ligands . Viruses such as SV40 will also be valuable tools .

Dy - namin II GFP ( wt , K44A ) constructs were obtained from M . McNiven ( Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN ) . Eps15 constructs were obtained from A . Benmerah and A . Dautry - Varsat ( Institut Pasteur , Paris , France ) and ARF6 constructs were obtained from J . Donaldson ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) , YFP - (cid:6) - tubulin was obtained from CLONTECH Laborato - ries , Inc . Cells were grown to 70 – 90 % confluency on coverslips and tran - siently transfected with plasmid - DNA using superfect reagent ( QIAGEN ) . Cells that showed relatively low levels of expression were used for analy - sis after 16 – 20 h . Drug treatments Cells were preincubated for 30 – 60 min at 37 (cid:2) C in DME complete con - taining 0 . 5 – 1 (cid:3) M Latrunculin A ( Molecular Probes ) , 100 (cid:3) M genistein ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 1 (cid:3) M nocodazole ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 2 . 5 (cid:3) g / ml BFA ( Serva ) , or 10 (cid:3) M amiloride ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Preincubation with 25 (cid:3) g / ml nystatin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) plus 10 (cid:3) g / ml progesterone ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was performed over night . The drugs were either present throughout the experiments or washed out 2 h after virus addition to show that the effects were reversible . Drug treatments did not result in a loss of cell viability . Infection and internalization assays Drug - treated cells or cells expressing XFP - tagged constructs were analyzed for infection with indirect immune fluorescence 20 h after virus addition us - ing antibodies against SV40 large T - antigen . In three independent experi - ments , at least 500 cells each were counted for the expression of T - anti - gen in the nucleus . Data were expressed as percentage (cid:4) SD of untreated control cells . To quantitate SV40 internalization biochemically , we used the assays as described previously ( Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ) . Triton X - 100 extraction , sucrose flotation , and fractionation Per experiment , four confluent 10 - cm dishes of cav - 1KO cells were used . SV40 was allowed to internalize into cav - 1KO cells for 30 min . Cells were scraped and resuspended in ice - cold MES buffer containing CLAP and PMSF . Cells were pelleted and lysed with 1 % Triton X - 100 in MES buffer containing protease inhibitors . Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min , mixed with an equal volume 80 % ( wt / vol ) sucrose in MES containing 1 % Triton X - 100 , and loaded underneath a linear 5 – 30 % sucrose gradient . After centrifugation at 38 , 000 rpm for 17 h , fractions were collected from the bottom , precipitated , analyzed by SDS - PAGE , and immunoblotted against SV40 . To follow the effect of Triton X - 100 extraction by microscopy , cells on coverslips were incubated with AF488 - SV40 and AF594 - Tf for 1 h at 4 (cid:2) C , rinsed , and incubated in complete medium at 37 (cid:2) C for 10 , 30 , 60 , or 240 min or treated immediately on ice . The cells were washed with ice - cold PBS and either incubated in Triton X - 100 ( 1 % in Pipes ) for 5 min on ice or mock treated . Control cells and Triton X - 100 – treated cells were washed three times with ice cold PBS , fixed , quenched , and examined as described in the section Microscopic techniques . Western blotting One confluent 10 - cm dish of cells was lysed in Laemmli sample buffer . Equal amounts of protein were heated to 95 (cid:2) C for 10 min and run in a 12 . 5 % SDS gel . Samples were immunoblotted against cav - 1 and actin . Microscopic techniques For immunofluorescence microscopy , cells were grown to subconfluency on coverslips and incubated with fluorescently labeled SV40 diluted in R - Medium for the indicated times . Cells were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde , quenched with 50 mM NH 4 Cl , permeabilized with 0 . 05 % saponin , and incubated with primary antibodies and the appropriate secondary anti - bodies . Coverslips were mounted with Immu Mount and examined using a confocal microscope ( model LSM510 ; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) equipped with a 63 or 100 (cid:10) / 1 . 40 plan - Apochromat objective . For fluorescence microscopy , fluorescently labeled SV40 was bound to cav - 1KO , cav - 1WT , or HuH7 cells ( or cells expressing a variety of XFP - tagged proteins ) on ice . Internalization followed after shifting the tempera - ture to 37 (cid:2) C for the indicated times . Endocytic structures were identified us - ing appropriate fluorescent markers ( Tf , dextran , SFV , and LY ) . In detail , cells were washed with R - Medium and fluorescently labeled SV40 was inter - nalized for 1 h at 37 (cid:2) C before addition of 50 (cid:3) g / ml AF488 - Tf for 5 min or AF594 - SFV for 40 min . In experiments using fluid phase markers , cells were incubated with AF594 - SV40 plus 1 (cid:3) g / ml LY for 1 h , the inoculum was washed off , and the cells were further incubated with LY for 5 min . Cells on coverslips were either fixed and mounted or transferred to custom - built alu - minium microscope - slide chambers ( Workshop Biochemistry , Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich ) and imaged live in CO 2 - independent medium on a heated stage at 37 (cid:2) C using wide - field ( model Axiovert ; Carl Zeiss Mi - croImaging , Inc . ) or confocal microscopy ( model LSM510 ; Carl Zeiss Micro - Imaging , Inc . ) . Internalized FITC - labeled virus particles were distinguished from surface - bound particles by shifting medium to pH 4 . 0 , completely quenching emitted light from extracellular FITC - SV40 . Videos were processed and analyzed using LSM 510 software package ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) . Overlap between two channels in confocal images was quantified using MatLab 6 . 5 . Image matrices of red and green channels were scaled to intensity values between 0 and 1 and multiplied , and a threshold was applied to define pixels that are posi - tive in both channels . The overlap of virus signal with the respective marker is expressed as colocalizing pixels divided by total pixel of virus signal . For thin section electron microscopy , cells were washed with R - Medium and incubated with SV40 at 37 (cid:2) C for 15 min , 2 h , or 18 h . Cells were fixed with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( 0 . 05 M sodium cacodylate , pH 7 . 2 , 50 mM KCl , 1 . 25 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 . 25 mM CaCl 2 ) for 30 min at JCB • VOLUME 168 • NUMBER 3 • 2005 488 RT followed by 1 . 5 h in 2 % OsO 4 .
