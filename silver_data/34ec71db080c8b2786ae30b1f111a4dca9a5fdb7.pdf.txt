Introduction A classic view in neuroscience holds that information storage and learning in neural circuits are made possible by alterations in synaptic transmission such as long - term potentiation ( LTP ) and long - term depression ( LTD ) . In the cerebellum , for example , bidirectional plasticity at PF - to - Purkinje cell synapses may be involved in motor learning ( Ito , 1984 ; Jo¨rntell and Hansel , 2006 ) . More recently , plasticity of the intrinsic excitability of neurons has received attention as a potential correlate of learning ( Hansel et al . , 2001 ; Zhang and Linden , 2003 ; Frick and Johnston , 2005 ; Mozzachiodi and Byrne , 2010 ) , but it remains unclear how in - trinsic plasticity complements synaptic plasticity in memory for - mation . Excitability changes result from modifications of voltage - or calcium - dependent ion channels . So far , different types of K channels have been implicated in intrinsic plasticity , including A - type K channels ( Schreurs et al . , 1998 ; Frick et al . , 2004 ) , calcium - activated BK channels ( Nelson et al . , 2005 ) , and SK channels ( Sourdet et al . , 2003 ; Lin et al . , 2008 ) . More - over , it has been shown that activity - dependent alterations in hyperpolarization - activated I h currents can adjust the excit - ability of neurons ( Wang et al . , 2003 ; Fan et al . , 2005 ; Brager and Johnston , 2007 ) . In cerebellar circuits , activity - dependent intrinsic plasticity has been described in granule cells ( Armano et al . , 2000 ) , Pur - kinjecells ( Schreursetal . , 1998 ) , aswellasinthetargetneuronsof Purkinje cells in the deep cerebellar nuclei ( DCN ) ( Aizenman and Linden , 2000 ) and the vestibular nuclei ( Nelson et al . , 2005 ) . In Purkinje cells , BK channel downregulation results in cerebellar ataxia ( Sausbier et al . , 2004 ) , while an enhancement of SK chan - nel function has been shown to improve ataxia ( Walter et al . , 2006 ) . These observations show how crucial the control of Pur - kinje cell activity patterns and intrinsic excitability is for proper motor coordination and suggest that Purkinje cells might use activity - dependent excitability alterations to fine - adjust the elec - trical output of the cerebellar cortex . During recent years , research on the cellular basis of cerebellar motor learning has largely focused on LTD at PF synapses onto ReceivedJune22 , 2010 ; revisedAug . 6 , 2010 ; acceptedAug . 9 , 2010 .

It has to be kept in mind , however , that the total synaptic gain ( the gain of neuronal responsiveness to synaptic activity ) can be modified , not only by changing properties of synaptic transmission ( as in LTD and LTP ) , but also by local modifications of intrinsic excitability . To examine whether Purkinje cell intrinsic plasticity can play a role in cerebellar information storage , we characterized the cellular mechanisms underlying intrinsic excitability alterations , and de - termined how intrinsic plasticity affects the spontaneous activity of Purkinje cells and PF synaptic gain . Materials and Methods Purkinjecellrecordings invitro . Sagittalslicesofthecerebellarvermis ( 250 (cid:1) m ) were prepared from postnatal day 17 ( P17 ) – P28 Sprague Dawley rats after decapitation and isoflurane anesthesia . This procedure is in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committees of both the Erasmus University Medical Center and the University of Chicago . In some experiments , mice ( P17 – P28 ) were used , as specified below . Thesliceswerecutonavibratome ( LeicaVT1000S ) usingceramic blades . Subsequently , the slices were kept in artificial CSF ( ACSF ) con - tainingthefollowing ( inm M ) : 124NaCl , 5KCl , 1 . 25Na 2 HPO 4 , 2MgSO 4 , 2 CaCl 2 , 26 NaHCO 3 , and 10 D - glucose , bubbled with 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 . The slices were allowed to recover for at least 1 h , and were then transferred to a submerged recording chamber superfused with ACSF at near - physiological temperature ( 34 – 35°C ) . In some recordings , the ACSF was supplemented with either 20 (cid:1) M bicuculline methiodide or 100 (cid:1) M picrotoxin to block GABA A receptors . Picrotoxin was used in some experiments , as bicuculline salts have been reported to interfere with SK channel function ( Seutin and Johnson , 1999 ) . In our hands , however , intrinsic plasticity was observed in - dependentofthetypeofantagonistused ( bicu - culline : Fig . 1 A , B , D , E ; picrotoxin : Fig . 1 F ) . Whole - cell patch - clamp recordings were per - formed under visual control using a 40 (cid:2) water - immersionobjectivemountedonaZeiss Axioskop 2FS microscope . Patch pipettes ( 3 – 4 M (cid:3) ) werefilledwithinternalsalinecontaining the following ( in m M ) : 9 KCl , 10 KOH , 120 K - gluconate , 3 . 48 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES , 4 NaCl , 4 Na 2 ATP , 0 . 4 Na 3 GTP , and 17 . 5 sucrose , pH adjusted to 7 . 25 . For cell - attached recordings , the pipette saline contained the following ( in m M ) : 125 NaCl , 10 HEPES , 3 KCl , and 2 CaCl 2 . All drugs were purchased from Sigma . Patch - clamp recordings were performed in current - clamp mode ( capacitance cancellation switched off ) using an EPC - 10 amplifier ( HEKA Electronics ) . Membrane voltage and current were filtered at 3 kHz , digitized at 8 kHz ( foractionpotentialkinetics : 33kHz ) , and acquired using Pulse software ( HEKA Elec - tronics ) . Inthemajorityofrecordings , ahyper - polarizing bias current was applied to prevent spontaneous spike activity . In some experi - ments ( see Fig . 8 ) , injection of bias currents was used to adjust the background spike rate of Purkinje cells . For PF stimulation , glass pi - pettes filled with ACSF were placed in the mo - lecular layer , and for CF stimulation in the granule cell layer . Test responses were evoked at a frequency of 0 . 05 Hz using (cid:4) 3 (cid:1) A pulses thatwereappliedfor500 (cid:1) s . Intrinsicplasticity wasmonitoredduringthetestperiodsbyinjec - tion of brief ( 550 ms ) depolarizing current pulses ( 100 – 200 pA ) adjusted to evoke 5 – 15 spikes . The spike count was taken as a measure of excitability . Input resistance ( R i ) was mea - sured by injection of hyperpolarizing test cur - rents ( 200 pA ; 100 ms ) and was calculated from the voltage transient toward the end of current injection . Confocal calcium imaging . Calcium transients were recorded using a Zeiss LSM 5 Exciter confocal microscope equipped with a (cid:2) 63 Zeiss Apochromat objective ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging ) . Fluorescence was excited at 488 nm using an argon laser ( Lasos Lasertechnik ) . For the calcium imaging experiments , sagittal slices of the cerebellar vermis ( 190 – 220 (cid:1) m ) were prepared from postnatal day 23 – 31 Sprague Dawley rats . Purkinje cells were loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator dye Oregon Green BAPTA - 2 ( 200 (cid:1) M ) . After 10 min of dye loading , the patch pipette was removed and the dye was allowed to diffuse into the dendrite for another (cid:4) 40 min . Subsequently , the cell was repatched with a second dye - filled patch electrode . This repatching protocol was used to avoid wash - out effects that might result from too long exposure to the pipette saline . The ACSF was supplemented with picrotoxin ( 100 (cid:1) M ) , and in some experiments with the anti - oxidant vitamin C ( 100 (cid:1) M ) . The recordings were performed at room temperature . Intrinsic plasticity was monitored using current pulses as in the nonimaging experiments , be - fore and after tetanic current injection . Spine calcium transients were triggeredby100HzPFstimulationatintervalsof0 . 5 – 2min . Thenumber of PF pulses was adjusted to evoke a pronounced calcium transient ( 2 – 8 pulses ) . Before tetanization , calcium transients were recorded during a 10 min baseline period . For each sweep , the data acquisition frequency wasintherangeof19 – 58Hz , dependingonthesizeoftheselectedregion of interest . Fluorescence changes were normalized to resting levels and expressed as the ratio (cid:5) F / F ( t ) (cid:6) [ F ( t ) (cid:1) F ] / F , where F ( t ) is the fluores - cence value at time t , and F is the averaged fluorescence obtained during the baseline period preceding the stimulus application .

Genetically modified mice . Mutant mice with a Purkinje cell - specific deletion of calcineurin ( PP2B ) were obtained by crossing the floxed CNB1 line ( Zeng et al . , 2001 ) with a L7 - Cre line ( Barski et al . , 2000 ) , resulting in a Purkinje cell - specific knock - out of the regulatory subunit ( CNB1 ) of PP2B ( C57BL6 / OlaHsd background ) . Littermates of the fol - lowing genotypes were used for the experiments : PP2B - lox / PP2B - lox / L7Cre ( L7 - PP2B ) and PP2B - lox / PP2B - lox ( littermate controls ) . (cid:2) CaMKII knock - out mice ( Elgersma et al . , 2002 ) and littermate control mice were obtained by breeding heterozygous knock - out mice in the C57BL6 / OlaHsd background . Purkinje cell recordings in vivo . To obtain single unit recordings in a nonanesthetized in vivo preparation , adult Sprague Dawley rats were decerebrated as previously described ( Bengtsson and Jo¨rntell , 2007 ) . Af - ter decerebration , the rats were paralyzed and mounted in a stereotaxic frame for increased mechanical stability . Tungsten - in - glass microelec - trodes were used for unitary , extracellular Purkinje cell recordings ( 5 – 25 (cid:1) m exposed tip ) . Tungsten - in - glass microelectrodes ( 50 – 100 (cid:1) m ex - posed tip ) for parallel fiber stimulation ( intensity 10 – 30 (cid:1) A , pulse width 0 . 1 ms ) were placed at middle depth of the molecular layer ( 100 – 150 (cid:1) m depth from the surface ) , at 200 – 600 (cid:1) m away from the recording elec - trode . Single - pulse PF stimulation was used to verify that simple spike activitywasevokedintherecordedPC . BurstPFstimulation ( 15pulsesat 100 Hz , repeated at 1 Hz for 5 min ) was delivered at intensities just above thresholdforevokingsimplespikes . Theexperimentalproceduresforthe in vivo recordings were approved by the local Swedish Animal Research Ethics Committee . DCN recordings in vitro . Cerebellar slices ( 275 – 290 (cid:1) m ) from P16 – P20 rats were prepared and superfused with artificial CSF containing the following ( in m M ) : 125 NaCl , 2 . 5 KCl , 1 . 3 NaH 2 PO 4 , 1 . 5 MgCl , 26 NaHCO 3 , 20 glucose , 2 . 5 CaCl 2 . The solution was bubbled with 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 . Whole - cell recordings in current - clamp mode were ob - tained at 31°C (cid:7) 0 . 5 from large DCN neurons in the lateral or interposi - tus nuclei using an Axoclamp2B - amplifier ( Molecular Devices ) . The intracellular electrode solution contained the following ( in m M ) : 134 K - gluconate , 6 KCl , 10 K - HEPES , 0 . 1 EGTA , 0 . 3 NaGTP , 2 K - ATP , 10 phosphocreatine , 2 MgCl 2 . All recorded DCN neurons showed sponta - neous firing ( 7 . 9 – 38 Hz ) and triphasic afterhyperpolarizations ( AHPs ) . Here , wetookadvantageofan invitro preparationtoinvestigatetheeffect of enhanced tonic Purkinje cell spike firing on spontaneous spike firing in DCN neurons . It has been pointed out that DCN spike patterns in vivo might be different than in slices ( Alvin˜a et al . , 2008 ) . However , the tonic spike frequency ranges reported here are well within the ranges found in awake rat DCN recordings ( LeDoux et al . , 1998 ) ; thus , it is unlikely that tonic Purkinje cell firing affects spontaneous firing in DCN neurons differently in vivo . Purkinje cell axons were stimulated using a pair of tungstenmicroelectrodeslocatedinthewhitematteraroundthecerebel - larnuclei . Thestimulusintensitywasadjustedat0 . 1Hztoinduceapause in the spontaneous firing of DCN neurons . Kynurenic acid ( 3 m M ) was bath applied to block excitatory neurotransmission . Repetitive stimula - tion was applied at 33 . 3 and 50 Hz . The switch from 33 . 3 to 50 Hz was applied after 2 – 4 min of stimulation at 33 . 3 Hz . Recordings were digi - tizedandstoredusingprogrammablesoftware ( Spike2 , CambridgeElec - tronicDesign ) . These procedures were done according to guidelines of the University of Tu¨bingen and the local Committee on Animal Care and Use . Immunohistochemistry . Two - week - old , four - week - old , andadult ( 3 – 4 months old ) rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital and perfused transcardially with 4 % paraformaldehyde . The brain was carefully dis - sected , postfixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 1 h at 4°C , and rinsed overnight in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( PB ) containing 30 % sucrose . Forty micrometer sections of the cerebellum were cut on a freezing microtome and collected in 0 . 1 M PB . Sections were heated up in 0 . 25 M sodium citrate to 80°C for 30 min , rinsed in TBS , and blocked in TBS containing 10 % normal horse serum ( NHS ) and 0 . 5 % Triton , for 1 h at room tem - perature . Sections were incubated for 48 – 72 h at 4°C in TBS containing 2 % NHS , 0 . 4 % Triton , and primary antibodies at the following concen - trations : rabbit anti - SK2 ( Alomone or Sigma ) 1 : 500 ; mouse - anti calbi - ndin ( Sigma ) 1 : 1000 . Subsequently , sections were rinsed in TBS , incubated with FITC - or Cy3 - ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) conjugated goat - anti - mouse or goat - anti - rabbit secondary antibodies at 1 : 200 for 1 . 5 – 2 h at room temperature . Sections were rinsed again in TBS and mounted directly on coverslips . Fluorescence images were taken with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser - scanning microscope . The rabbit anti - SK2 channel antibodies obtained from both Alomone and Sigma were di - rected against a sequence in the C - terminal domain of SK2 channel sub - units , whichcorrespondstoaminoacids542 – 559 . Theimmunostainings obtained with both antibodies were very similar , which is why we only show stainings obtained with the anti - SK2 antibody purchased from AlomoneLabs ( seeFig . 4 ) . Thespecificityofthisantibodywasconfirmed using slices from SK2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice and littermate controls ( supplemental Fig . 6 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) ( for protocol details , see Piochon et al . , 2007 ) . Data analysis . Data obtained from the Purkinje cell recordings in vitro were analyzed using Pulsefit ( HEKA Electronics ) and Igor Pro software ( WaveMetrics ) . Forstatisticalanalysis , weusedthepairedStudent’s t test and the Mann – Whitney U test , when appropriate . Peristimulus time histograms ( PSTHs ) and cumulative spike probabilities ( see Fig . 8 ) were calculated using SigmaPlot software ( Hearne Scientific Software ) . Data obtained from the in vivo recordings were analyzed using the two - tailed Student’s t test . Data obtained from the DCN neuron recordings were analyzed off - line using programmable software Spike 2 ( Cambridge Electronic Design ) , Igor ( WaveMetrics ) , and SigmaStat ( SPSS ) . Statisti - cal analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed - rank test on data taken from 100 s before and 100 s after the switch from 30 to 50 Hz stimulation . The data from the first 10 s after the switch were excluded from the analysis . In all figures , the values shown represent the mean (cid:7) SEM . Results Purkinje cell intrinsic plasticity can be observed in vitro and in vivo To monitor intrinsic excitability changes in Purkinje cells , we performed whole - cell patch - clamp recordings in cerebellar slices ( 250 (cid:1) m thick ) obtained from P17 – P28 Sprague Dawley rats at near - physiological temperature ( 34 – 35°C ) . Intrinsic excitability was measured in current - clamp mode by injecting brief depolar - izing currents ( (cid:4) 100 – 200 pA ) that at the beginning of the re - cordings were adjusted to evoke 5 – 15 spikes . During the test periods before and after tetanization , these current steps were delivered at 0 . 05 Hz . GABA A receptors were blocked by bath application of bicuculline methiodide ( 20 (cid:1) M ) or picrotoxin ( 100 (cid:1) M ) . In these recordings , the number of depolarization - evoked spikes was taken as a measure of Purkinje cell excitability . An enhanced spike count was observed after repeated injection of depolarizing currents that were delivered at 5 Hz for 3 s ( 255 . 4 (cid:7) 20 . 3 % of baseline (cid:7) SEM ; n (cid:6) 9 ; last 5 min ; p (cid:6) 0 . 00006 ) ( Fig . 1 A ) . Under control conditions , the spike count remained stable ( 103 . 4 (cid:7) 10 . 9 % ; n (cid:6) 10 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 19 ) ( Fig . 1 A ) . In the same record - ings , we also monitored the amplitude of the AHP following the depolarizing current steps . After tetanization , the AHP ampli - tude was significantly reduced ( 81 . 9 (cid:7) 7 . 2 % ; n (cid:6) 9 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 02985 ) ( Fig . 1 B ) , but remained stable under control conditions ( 102 . 2 (cid:7) 3 . 3 % ; n (cid:6) 10 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 47 ) ( Fig . 1 B ) . Intrinsic plasticity was also observed when no GABA A receptor antagonists were present in the bath ( spike count : 155 . 2 (cid:7) 5 . 4 % ; n (cid:6) 15 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 000007 ) ( Fig . 1 C ) . However , the excitability increase was significantly larger when inhibition was blocked ( p (cid:6) 0 . 00006 ) , suggesting that spontaneous GABAergic transmission limits intrinsic plasticity . A pronounced increase in the number of depolarization - evoked spikes was also observed following PF tetanization ( 1 Hz , 5 min : 645 . 0 (cid:7) 113 . 9 % ; n (cid:6) 9 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 00138 ) ( Fig . 1 D ) . This 1 Hz PF stimulation protocol has previously been used for PF - LTP induction ( Coesmans et al . , 2004 ) , and reliably elicited LTP un - 13632 • J .

Finally , we adopted a PF burst protocol ( 10 – 15 pulses at 100 Hz , repeated at 1 – 3 s intervals for 5 min ) , which was designed to reflect granule cell activity patterns in vivo ( Chadderton et al . , 2004 ; Jo¨rntell and Ekerot , 2006 ) . Application of this 100 Hz PF burst protocol triggered intrinsic plasticity ( 179 . 6 (cid:7) 19 . 8 % ; n (cid:6) 5 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 00388 ) ( Fig . 1 F ) , and elicited LTP ( supplemental Fig . 1 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supple - mental material ) ( see also Smith and Otis , 2005 ) . None of these three tetanization protocols caused a significant change in the input resistance ( current injection protocol : 100 . 3 (cid:7) 2 . 5 % ; n (cid:6) 9 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 91 ; 1 Hz PF protocol : 96 . 8 (cid:7) 4 . 7 % ; n (cid:6) 9 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 08 ; 100 Hz PF protocol : 100 . 0 (cid:7) 0 . 5 % ; n (cid:6) 5 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 95 ) ( supplemental Table 1 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . However , intrinsic plasticity ( current step protocol ) ( Fig . 1 A ) was associated with a decrease in the spike threshold ( required current injection from (cid:1) 65 mV ; before : 260 . 7 (cid:7) 54 . 2 pA ; after tetanization : 225 . 0 (cid:7) 46 . 9 pA ; n (cid:6) 7 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 0465 ) . To evaluate the physiological relevance of Purkinje cell intrin - sic plasticity , we performed unitary , extracellular Purkinje cell recordings in nonanesthetized , decerebrated adult rats ( P60 – P90 ) . In these in vivo recordings , the spontaneous spike rate was 42 . 4 (cid:7) 4 . 9 Hz ( control recordings ; n (cid:6) 5 ) . Application of the 100 Hz PF burst protocol caused an increase in the rate of spontane - ous spike firing of Purkinje cells ( control : 100 . 1 (cid:7) 1 . 0 % ; n (cid:6) 5 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 34 ; after tetanization : 115 . 0 (cid:7) 2 . 8 % ; n (cid:6) 5 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 0023 ) ( Fig . 2 A , B ) . Application of the 1 Hz PF stimulation protocol did not result in spike rate changes ( supplemental Fig . 2 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . These in vivo re - cordings differ from the intrinsic plasticity experiments shown in Figure 1 , in that the spontaneous spike rate ( rather than the num - ber of depolarization - evoked spikes ) was measured and inhibi - tion was left intact , thus allowing us to assess intrinsic plasticity under more physiological conditions . To examine whether in - trinsic plasticity can be observed under these conditions in vitro , weappliedboththecurrentstepprotocolandthe100HzPFburstprotocol , respectively , to cerebellar slices , when GABAergic inhi - bition was left intact , and Purkinje cells were allowed to sponta - neously discharge ( hyperpolarizing bias currents were omitted ) , resulting in an average background spike rate of 24 . 1 (cid:7) 2 . 9 Hz ( control recordings ; n (cid:6) 8 ) ( Fig . 2 C ) . Under these conditions , repeated current injection induced a lasting increase in the spike rate ( 140 . 9 (cid:7) 15 . 3 % ; n (cid:6) 10 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 02565 ; control : 85 . 7 (cid:7) 5 . 9 % ; n (cid:6) 8 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 04557 ) ( Fig . 2 C ) . Application of the 100 Hz PF burst protocol also resulted in an increase in the background spike rate ( 175 . 2 (cid:7) 15 . 4 % ; n (cid:6) 8 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 00024 ) ( Fig . 2 D ) . As the in vivo recordings were performed using P60 – P90 rats , we also exam - ined whether intrinsic plasticity can be observed in that age group in vitro . In recordings from P60 – P100 Purkinje cells in slices , we indeed observed an excitability increase when the 100 Hz PF stimulation protocol was applied ( spike count : 280 . 6 (cid:7) 24 . 9 % , n (cid:6) 8 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 00001 ) ( supplemental Fig . 3 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . These recordings sug - gest that intrinsic plasticity is a robust phenomenon that can be observed both in vitro and in vivo , in young adult and adult ani - mals , and in the absence and presence of GABA A receptor block - ers . Furthermore , the change in intrinsic excitability can be monitored when counting depolarization - evoked spikes , or when measuring spontaneous spike activity . It can be argued that both whole - cell patch - clamp recordings from Purkinje cells in vitro and single - unit recordings in vivo might disrupt physiolog - ical Purkinje cell responses . We thus additionally characterized intrinsic plasticity using cell - attached recordings in vitro , which might provide a less invasive recording technique . When cell - attached recordings were performed from P20 – P27 rats , an av - erage background spike frequency of 32 . 5 (cid:7) 4 . 8 Hz ( control recordings ; n (cid:6) 7 ) ( Fig . 2 F ) was observed . Application of the 100 Hz PF burst protocol resulted in an increase in the spontaneous spike rate ( 140 . 3 (cid:7) 6 . 9 % ; n (cid:6) 10 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 0002 ; control : 94 . 9 (cid:7) 6 . 6 % ; n (cid:6) 7 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 83 ) ( Fig . 2 E , F ) . These cell - attached record - ings confirm that intrinsic plasticity is a robust phenomenon that can be observed under a wide range of experimental conditions .

Neurosci . , October13 , 2010 • 30 ( 41 ) : 13630 – 13643 • 13633 rent step protocol ( Fig . 1 A ) . GABAergic transmission was left intact , unless stated otherwise . Intrinsic plasticity is mediated by a downregulation of SK channels Intrinsic excitability changes can be medi - ated by alterations in voltage - or calcium - sensitiveionchannels ( ZhangandLinden , 2003 ; Frick and Johnston , 2005 ) . In adult Purkinje cells , high - quality dendritic volt - age control is difficult to achieve . Because of this so - called “space - clamp” problem , we screened for types of ion channels in - volved by addressing three questions after bath application of ion channel antago - nists : ( 1 ) Is the spike count upregulated after drug application ? ( 2 ) Is there a change in the action potential waveform ? and ( 3 ) Does application of an antagonist occlude an excitability increase caused by tetanic current injection ( 5 Hz , 3 s ) ? Un - der control conditions , the amplitude and kinetics ( risetime / spikewidth ) ofindivid - ual action potentials were unaffected after tetanization . Rather , we observed that af - ter tetanization , the rate of depolarization toward spike threshold was enhanced fol - lowing each action potential ( Fig . 3 A , B , Table 1 ) ( n (cid:6) 5 ) , resulting in the elevated spike rate . To determine the mechanism underly - ing this change in the firing rate , we first tested the effects of 4 - aminopyridine ( 4 - AP ) , an antagonist of some types of voltage - gated Kv channels , including A - type K currents ( I A ) . A previous study has demon - strated that delay eyeblink conditioning in rabbitsisassociatedwithanincreaseinPur - kinje cell excitability ( Schreurs et al . , 1998 ) , resembling similar excitability changes observed in CA1 pyramidal cells after trace eyeblink conditioning ( Moyer et al . , 1996 ) . This type of Purkinje cell intrinsic plasticity was described as being mediated by changes in I A ( Schreurs et al . , 1998 ) . I A has also been implicated in excitability al - terations in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells in vitro ( Ramakers and Storm , 2002 ; Frick et al . , 2004 ) . When 4 - AP was bath applied ( 100 (cid:1) M ) , the spike count was sig - nificantly enhanced ( 177 . 0 (cid:7) 8 . 4 % ; last 3 min ; n (cid:6) 11 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 000007 ) ( Fig . 3 C ) . However , the width of individual action potentials was significantly increased , too ( before : 0 . 27 (cid:7) 0 . 03 ms ; 4 - AP : 0 . 44 (cid:7) 0 . 04 ms ; n (cid:6) 11 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 025 ) ( Fig . 3 C , Table 1 ) . Such a prolongation was not seen under control conditions ( before : 0 . 29 (cid:7) 0 . 03 ms ; after tetanization : 0 . 28 (cid:7) 0 . 02 ms ; n (cid:6) 5 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 18 ) ( Table 1 ) . Thus , a downregulation of 4 - AP - sensitive Kv conductances does not mediate the form of intrinsic plasticity described here . Ac - cordingly , bath application of 4 - AP did not occlude further ex - citability increases following tetanic current injection [ 158 . 0 (cid:7) 13 . 9 % ; n (cid:6) 6 ( Fig . 3 D ) as compared to 155 . 2 (cid:7) 5 . 4 % ; n (cid:6) 15 ( Fig . 1 C ) ; p (cid:6) 0 . 09 ] . At the beginning of these occlusion experiments , the spike count was reset to baseline levels ( 5 – 15 spikes ) by ad - Figure3 . CellularmechanismsunderlyingPurkinjecellintrinsicplasticity .

On average , there was no sig - nificant difference in the amplitudes of these currents between the control group and the drug application groups described here ( current steps ; control : 180 . 81 (cid:7) 17 . 74 pA ; n (cid:6) 15 ; 4 - AP : 160 . 0 (cid:7) 26 . 64 pA ; p (cid:6) 0 . 52 ; n (cid:6) 7 ; HpTX - 2 : 150 . 0 (cid:7) 32 . 56 pA ; p (cid:6) 0 . 51 ; n (cid:6) 5 ; apamin : 139 . 54 (cid:7) 11 . 99 pA ; p (cid:6) 0 . 09 ; n (cid:6) 11 ; Student’s t test / holding currents ; control : (cid:1) 471 . 56 (cid:7) 14 . 02 pA ; n (cid:6) 15 ; 4 - AP : (cid:1) 450 . 86 (cid:7) 45 . 65 pA ; p (cid:6) 0 . 57 ; n (cid:6) 7 ; HpTX - 2 : (cid:1) 384 . 0 (cid:7) 36 . 69pA ; p (cid:6) 0 . 06 ; n (cid:6) 5 ; apamin : (cid:1) 527 . 18 (cid:7) 29 . 38pA ; p (cid:6) 0 . 08 ; n (cid:6) 11 ; Student’s t test ) ( supplemental Fig . 4 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . Moreover , there was no significant correlation between the current step amplitude or holding current amplitude , respectively , and the intrinsic plastic - ity amplitude ( current steps ; control : p (cid:6) 0 . 35 ; 4 - AP : p (cid:6) 0 . 81 ; HpTX - 2 : p (cid:6) 0 . 16 ; apamin : p (cid:6) 0 . 54 ; holding currents ; control : p (cid:6) 0 . 51 ; 4 - AP : p (cid:6) 0 . 99 ; HpTX - 2 : p (cid:6) 0 . 06 ; apamin : p (cid:6) 0 . 08 ; Pearson test ) ( supplemental Fig . 4 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) , excluding the possibility that dif - ferences in the occlusion experiments might be due to differences in the amplitude of either the current steps or the bias holding currents . We next tested the effects of heteropodatoxin - 2 ( HpTX - 2 ) , a selective inhibitor of Kv4 . 2 - mediated I A currents . Bath applica - tion of HpTX - 2 ( 100 n M ) significantly enhanced the spike count ( 187 . 1 (cid:7) 8 . 6 % ; n (cid:6) 7 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 00004 ) ( Fig . 3 E ) . Like 4 - AP , HpTX - 2 increased the action potential width ( before : 0 . 32 (cid:7) 0 . 04 ms ; after tetanization : 0 . 34 (cid:7) 0 . 04 ms ; n (cid:6) 6 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 033 ) ( Fig . 3 E , Table 1 ) , but with HpTX - 2 this effect was less pronounced . HpTX - 2 appli - cation did not occlude excitability increases triggered by tetanic current injection ( 165 . 1 (cid:7) 12 . 9 % ; n (cid:6) 6 ) ( Fig . 3 F ) ( as compared to 155 . 2 (cid:7) 5 . 4 % ; n (cid:6) 15 ) ( Fig . 1 C ) ( p (cid:6) 0 . 88 ) . These data show that Kv4 . 2 - mediated I A currents are not involved in Purkinje cell intrinsic plasticity . Next , we examined the involvement of SK - type calcium - dependent K channels in Purkinje cell intrinsic plasticity . In layer V pyramidal neurons , SK channels have been implicated in activity - dependent excitability increases ( Sourdet et al . , 2003 ) . In Purkinje cells , SK channels have been shown to control spike firing ( Edgerton and Reinhart , 2003 ; Womack and Khodakhah , 2003 ) . Bath application of the SK - channel blocker apamin ( 3 n M ) caused a pronounced increase in the spike count ( 316 . 1 (cid:7) 39 . 7 % ; n (cid:6) 15 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 00003 ) ( Fig . 3 G ) , without changing the action potential width ( before : 0 . 22 (cid:7) 0 . 02 ms ; apamin : 0 . 24 (cid:7) 0 . 02 ms ; n (cid:6) 15 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 08 ) ( Fig . 3 G , Table 1 ) . However , following each action potential , the rate of depolarization toward spike thresh - old was enhanced in the presence of apamin . This effect was also observed under control conditions after tetanization ( Fig . 3 A , Table 1 ) . Finally , after bath application of apamin , subsequent tetanization caused only a moderate increase in the spike count ( 119 . 6 (cid:7) 6 . 4 % ; n (cid:6) 10 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 008 ) ( Fig . 3 H ) , which was signifi - cantly lower than that observed under control conditions ( 155 . 2 (cid:7) 5 . 4 % ; n (cid:6) 15 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 009 ) . This partial occlusion effect after apamin bath application suggests that a downregulation of SK - type K currents contributes to Purkinje cell intrinsic plastic - ity . Finally , we tested the BK - type calcium - dependent K channel blocker iberiotoxin . BK channels control the spread of calcium spikes in Purkinje cell dendrites ( Rancz and Ha¨usser , 2006 ) , and might therefore be involved in excitability control as well . While bath application of iberiotoxin ( 50 n M ) enhanced the spike count ( 184 . 1 (cid:7) 30 . 2 % ; n (cid:6) 7 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 02 ) ( supplemental Fig . 5 A , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) , it did not occlude intrinsic plasticity after current injection ( 159 . 9 (cid:7) 19 . 6 % ; n (cid:6) 6 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 80 ) ( supplemental Fig . 5 B , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) , which rules out the possibility that BK - type K channels are involved in intrinsic plasticity . These experiments show that the form of intrinsic plasticity described here is at least partially mediated by a downregulation of SK - type calcium - dependent K channels . Of the three types of apamin - sensitive SK channel subunits ( SK1 – SK3 ) , only SK2 channelsareexpressedinratPurkinjecells , buttheirlevelshavebeen shown to decline during the first 3 postnatal weeks ( Cingolani et al . , 2002 ) . In contrast to rats , mice have been shown to express SK2 channels in the adult Purkinje cell layer ( Sailer et al . , 2004 ) . As our patch - clamp recordings were obtained from up to 4 - week - oldrats , weexaminedwhetherSK2channelsareindeedexpressed in young adult and adult rat Purkinje cells as suggested by record - ings from our laboratory and others ( Womack and Khodakhah , 2003 ) , and performed immunostainings using antibodies di - rected against the C - terminal domain of the SK2 channel sub - Table1 .

Cerebellar sec - tions obtained from 2 - week - old rats ( top row ) , 4 - week - old rats ( middle row ) , and adult rats ( 3 – 4 months ; bottom row ) indi - cated presence of SK2 channel subunits at all three ages , which overlapped with the Purkinje cell - specific calbindin staining . Throughout all ages , but particularly in the adult sections , we also observed SK2 channel staining around granule cell bodies , and in the molecular layer . These immunohistochemical data show that SK2 channels are expressed in Purkinje cells during development and after maturation ; therefore , SK2 channels can be involved in the type of Purkinje cell excitability alterations described here . What molecular events are involved in intrinsic plasticity up - stream of the functional downregulation of SK2 channels de - scribed above ? We first examined whether intrinsic plasticity depends on dendritic calcium signaling , and the activation of protein phosphatases 1 , 2A , and 2B , which have been implicated in PF - LTP ( Coesmans et al . , 2004 ; Belmeguenai and Hansel , 2005 ) . Intrinsic plasticity was blocked when the calcium chelator BAPTA ( 20 m M ) was added to the pipette saline ( 86 . 9 (cid:7) 13 . 6 % ; n (cid:6) 11 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 37 ) ( Fig . 5 A ) , suggesting that calcium is a prereq - uisite for the induction process . In the absence of tetanization , BAPTA application alone transiently enhances the spike rate , but has no lasting effect on Purkinje cell excitability ( n (cid:6) 10 ) ( for wash - in control recordings for all drug experiments shown in Figs . 5 and 6 , see supplemental Fig . 7 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . When the PP1 / 2A inhibitor microcystin LR was added to the pipette saline ( 10 (cid:1) M ) , the current injection protocol failed to enhance the spike count ( 105 . 5 (cid:7) 20 . 8 % ; n (cid:6) 7 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 80 ) ( Fig . 5 B ) . Similarly , bath application of the PP1 / 2A inhibitor okadaic acid ( 1 (cid:1) M ) blocked intrinsic plasticity ( 108 . 8 (cid:7) 4 . 2 % ; n (cid:6) 6 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 064 ) ( Fig . 5 B ) . WhenthePP2BinhibitorcyclosporinAwasbath applied ( 100 (cid:1) M ) , the spike count was even decreased ( 55 . 6 (cid:7) 10 . 1 % ; n (cid:6) 8 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 00317 ) ( Fig . 5 B ) . These results suggest that Purkinje cell intrinsic plasticity shares the requirement for PP1 / 2AandPP2BactivationwithPF - LTP . ThePP2Bdependence of intrinsic plasticity was confirmed using mice , in which PP2B was selectively knocked out in Purkinje cells ( L7 - PP2B mice ) . In wild - type mice , application of the current injection protocol en - hanced the spike rate ( 138 . 9 (cid:7) 10 . 2 % ; n (cid:6) 16 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 009 ) ( Fig . 5 C ) . Intrinsic plasticity was absent in L7 - PP2B knock - out mice ( 89 . 7 (cid:7) 9 . 4 % ; n (cid:6) 9 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 40 ) ( Fig . 5 C ) . Conversely , PP2B activation can enhance the spike count : when active PP2B was added to the pipette saline ( 5 (cid:1) g / ml ) , the spike count increased significantly ( 149 . 1 (cid:7) 15 . 2 % ; n (cid:6) 11 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 00423 ) ( supplemen - tal Fig . 8 A , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental ma - terial ) . Subsequently , intrinsic plasticity was occluded ( 101 . 5 (cid:7) 9 . 0 % ; n (cid:6) 8 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 87 ) ( supplemental Fig . 8 B , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . The phosphatase de - pendence of intrinsic plasticity is not restricted to excitability increases triggered by application of the current step protocol . Likewise , applicationofthe1HzPFstimulationprotocolfailedto cause excitability changes in the presence of the PP1 / 2A inhibitor okadaic acid ( 1 (cid:1) M ; 105 . 4 (cid:7) 5 . 8 % ; n (cid:6) 8 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 37 ) ( Fig . 5 D ) or Figure4 .

These data suggest that intrinsic excitability changes triggered by current injection or PF tetanization share the same induction mechanism , which in - volves an activation of protein phosphatases 1 , 2A , and 2B . At PF synapses , bidirectional synaptic plasticity is governed by a molecular switch mechanism involving PP1 , 2A , and 2B as well as the (cid:2) isoform of calcium / calmodulin - dependent kinase II ( (cid:2) CaMKII ) ( Jo¨rntell and Hansel , 2006 ) . To examine whether (cid:2) CaMKII is involved in intrinsic plasticity , we applied the cur - rent injection protocol to Purkinje cells in slices prepared from (cid:2) CaMKII knock - out mice ( Elgersma et al . , 2002 ) , and wild - type controls . Intrinsic plasticity was observed in both wild - type mice ( 246 . 0 (cid:7) 18 . 6 % ; n (cid:6) 7 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 00001 ) ( Fig . 6 A ) and in (cid:2) CaMKII knock - out mice ( 240 . 4 (cid:7) 22 . 0 % ; n (cid:6) 12 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 00001 ) ( Fig . 6 A ) . There was no statistical difference between these two groups ( p (cid:6) 0 . 87 ) , suggesting that (cid:2) CaMKII is not required to enhance excitability . Ithasrecentlybeenshownthatthesurfaceexpression of SK2 channels is regulated by cAMP - dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) ( Ren et al . , 2006 ) , which has also been implemented in hippocampal intrinsic plasticity ( Oh et al . , 2009 ; Rosenkranz et al . , 2009 ) . When the PKA inhibitor KT5720 ( 30 (cid:1) M ) was applied to the bath , we observed a strong reduction in excitability in - creases ( 135 . 9 (cid:7) 10 . 5 % ; n (cid:6) 14 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 00276 ) ( Fig . 6 B ) . At a higher concentration ( 60 (cid:1) M ) , KT5720 blocked intrinsic plastic - ity , and even caused a slight reduction in excitability after tetani - zation ( 80 . 6 (cid:7) 5 . 2 % ; n (cid:6) 12 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 00179 ) ( Fig . 6 B ) . At both concentrations , the reduction in the intrinsic plasticity amplitude was significant ( 30 (cid:1) M : p (cid:6) 0 . 00026 ; 60 (cid:1) M : p (cid:6) 0 . 00012 ; Mann – Whitney U test ) , which shows that PKA activation is required to enhance excitability . We finally examined the involvement of casein kinase 2 ( CK2 ) in intrinsic plasticity . CK2 is a constitu - tively active enzyme ( Bildl et al . , 2004 ) that phosphorylates SK2 - associated calmodulin and reduces the calcium sensitivity of SK2 channels ( Allen et al . , 2007 ) . Intrinsic plasticity was blocked in the presence of the CK2 inhibitor emodin ( 30 (cid:1) M ; 106 . 9 (cid:7) 12 . 8 % ; n (cid:6) 8 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 62 ) ( Fig . 6 C ) . As in wash - in control experi - mentsemodinapplicationaffectedthespikerateintheabsenceof tetanization ( supplemental Fig . 7 F , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) , we also used the more selective CK2 inhibitor 2 - dimethylamino - 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 - tetrabromo - 1 H - benzi - midazole ( DMAT ) . In the presence of DMAT , intrinsic plasticity was blocked as well ( DMAT ; 5 (cid:1) M : 119 . 7 (cid:7) 6 . 3 % ; n (cid:6) 6 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 023 ; 10 (cid:1) M : 113 . 5 (cid:7) 9 . 8 % ; n (cid:6) 6 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 30 ) ( Fig . 6 D ) , suggest - ing that active CK2 is required for intrinsic plasticity . Purkinje cell intrinsic plasticity does not affect DCN spike rates Under physiological conditions , Purkinje cells are spontaneously active and fire simple spikes at 30 – 80 Hz ( Simpson et al . , 1996 ) . In our recordings from spontaneously active Purkinje cells sum - marized in Figure 2 , we observed background spike frequencies of (cid:4) 40 Hz in vivo and (cid:4) 30 Hz in vitro , respectively . Under vari - ous recording conditions both in vivo and in vitro , the spontane - ous background spike frequency was enhanced when intrinsic plasticity protocols were applied ( Fig . 2 ) . These results show that intrinsic plasticity can increase the rate of Purkinje cell pace - maker activity , which is largely of intrinsic origin and persists when glutamatergic transmission is blocked ( Ha¨usser and Clark , Figure5 .

Purkinje cells form inhibitory synapses with their DCN target cells ( Ito , 1984 ) , which on their own are spon - taneously active ( Jahnsen , 1986 ) . We thus examined whether the spontaneous discharge rate of DCN neurons was affected by the enhanced background spike rate of Purkinje cells . Whole - cell patch - clamp recordings in current - clamp mode were obtained from DCN neurons in vitro , and Purkinje cell axons were stimu - lated in the white matter ( Pedroarena and Schwarz , 2003 ) . Two different sets of experiments were performed : In a first set of experiments , the resulting IPSPs ( 16 . 0 (cid:7) 1 . 9 mV ; n (cid:6) 7 ) consis - tently evoked a pause in spontaneous DCN firing ( Fig . 7 A ) . In the second set of experiments , higher stimulus intensities were used to examine whether an enhanced inhibitory input ( reflecting a higher number of simultaneously active Purkinje cells , 24 . 6 (cid:7) 2 . 6 mV ; n (cid:6) 8 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 017 ; Mann – Whitney U test ) affects DCN neu - rons more efficiently ( Fig . 7 B ) . Purkinje cell spontaneous activity was mimicked by protracted ( 2 – 4 min ) 30 Hz activation of Pur - kinje cell axons , allowing the synapses to reach stationary levels of short - term depression ( Telgkamp and Raman , 2002 ; Pedroarena and Schwarz , 2003 ) . Intrinsic plasticity was simulated by a switch from 30 to 50 Hz activation . These frequencies were selected to mimic the increase in the spike rate observed following applica - tion of intrinsic plasticity protocols in vitro ( Fig . 2 C – F ) . Activa - tion at 30 Hz resulted first in a transient cessation of DCN firing [ Fig . 7 A ( insets ) , B ( top ) ] , followed by discharge at a reduced rate . However , there was no further reduction upon switch to 50 Hz , using either low or high stimulus intensities ( low 30 Hz : 95 . 2 (cid:7) 2 . 8 % ; low 50 Hz : 93 . 6 (cid:7) 4 . 6 % ; n (cid:6) 7 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 68 ; high 30 Hz : 77 . 4 (cid:7) 3 . 8 % ; high 50 Hz : 79 . 5 (cid:7) 5 . 0 % ; n (cid:6) 8 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 46 ; Wilcoxon signed - rank test ) ( Fig . 7 ) . The observation that the DCN spike rate was not affected by an enhanced frequency of inhibitory Purkinje cell output is possibly explained by the filtering proper - ties of synapses depressed to stationary levels ( Pedroarena and Schwarz , 2003 ) , since DCN neurons are affected by the frequency of inhibitory inputs if these are activated for shorter periods ( Telgkamp and Raman , 2002 ) , or if depression is lacking ( Gauck and Ja¨ger , 2000 ) . To assess the degree of depression , IPSPs were averaged over a 1 min period before and after the switch from 30 to 50 Hz stimulation . At 30 Hz stimulation , IPSPs were reduced to 8 . 8 (cid:7) 1 . 9 % at high stimulus intensity ( n (cid:6) 8 ) , and to 9 . 7 (cid:7) 1 . 4 % at low stimulus intensity ( n (cid:6) 7 ) ( Fig . 7 C ) . The strong depression at 30 Hz stimulation correlates with the moderate effect of tonic Purkinje cell activation on the firing rate of DCN neurons . At 50 Hz stimulation , IPSPs were further reduced to almost half of the levels found at 30 Hz : 5 . 6 (cid:7) 1 . 5 % at high stimulus intensity ( n (cid:6) 8 ) , and to 5 . 1 (cid:7) 1 . 1 % at low stimulus intensity ( n (cid:6) 7 ) ( Fig . 7 C ) . At both intensities , this further reduc - tion in IPSP amplitudes upon switch from 30 to 50 Hz stimulation was significant ( high intensity : p (cid:6) 0 . 022 ; low intensity : p (cid:6) 0 . 016 ; Wilcoxon signed - rank test ) and present in all neurons examined . DepressionofIPSPsduringatrainhaspreviouslybeendescribedforshorterstimulustrainsintheDCN ( Telgkamp and Raman , 2002 , Pedroarena and Schwarz , 2003 ) . Together , our DCN recordings suggest that the enhanced frequency of Purkinje cell pacemaker ac - tivity , which is associated with intrinsic plasticity , does not have a direct effect on the spontaneous spike rate of DCN neurons . The results also point to the stronger depression of inhibitory Purkinje cell – DCN neuron synapses as a mechanism to counterbalance the inhibitory effect of enhanced IPSP frequencies . Intrinsic excitability changes affect the impact of PF signaling What then are the functional consequences of alterations in Pur - kinje cell excitability ? Does intrinsic plasticity affect the input – output function of Purkinje cells ? It has previously been shown for weak PF inputs that the number of evoked spikes linearly reflects synaptic input strength ( Walter and Khodakhah , 2006 ; Mittmann and Ha¨usser , 2007 ) .

We then mimicked LTD and LTP conditions by adjusting the stimulus strength to (cid:7) 25 % of the control level ( Fig . 8 A ) . We observed a linear rela - tionship between stimulus strength and the number of evoked spikes , but the dynamic range was very limited : varying the stim - ulus strength over a range of 50 % led to variations in the number of evoked spikes ranging from one to four spikes ( n (cid:6) 11 ) ( Fig . 8 B ) . This observation suggests a limited control of the spike out - put of Purkinje cells by LTD and LTP , respectively . After repeated current injection , the spike output in all three intensity groups was slightly enhanced , but this trend did not reach statistical significance ( n (cid:6) 8 – 9 ; (cid:1) 25 % : p (cid:6) 0 . 90 ; control : p (cid:6) 0 . 53 ; (cid:9) 25 % : p (cid:6) 0 . 60 ; paired Student’s t test ) ( Fig . 8 B ) , suggesting that intrin - sic plasticity has at most a weak effect on the spike output . We obtained similar results when analyzing the spike frequency , rather than the number of evoked spikes . We calculated increases in the spike frequency resulting from PF stimulation as the ratio of the frequency recorded from 3 spikes right after stimulation to the frequency recorded before . Increasing stimulus strength en - hancedthisfrequencyratio ( (cid:1) 25 % : 1 . 5 (cid:7) 0 . 1 ; n (cid:6) 11 ; control : 2 . 2 (cid:7) 0 . 3 ; n (cid:6) 11 ; (cid:9) 25 % : 2 . 9 (cid:7) 0 . 4 ; n (cid:6) 10 ) . Aftertetanization , theseratios were not significantly changed ( (cid:1) 25 % : 1 . 7 (cid:7) 0 . 4 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 48 ; n (cid:6) 9 ; control : 2 . 3 (cid:7) 0 . 5 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 33 ; n (cid:6) 9 ; (cid:9) 25 % : 2 . 8 (cid:7) 0 . 6 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 83 ; n (cid:6) 8 ; pairedStudent’s t test ) . Intheseexperiments , changesinback - ground spiking were prevented by injection of bias currents . To examine whether the intrinsic plasticity - associated increase in the back - ground spike rate itself affects PF signaling , we performed the opposite experiment and injected bias currents to vary the background spike rate ( mimicking intrin - sic plasticity ) , while the PF stimulus strength was kept constant ( Fig . 8 C ) . Al - terations in the spike rate ranging from 30 to 60 Hz did not result in changes in the immediate PF response ( Fig . 8 C ) , but the enhanced background spike rate lowered the signal - to - noise ratio and thus lowered the transient PF - evoked net increase in spike firing ( n (cid:6) 7 ) ( Fig . 8 C – I ) . These data are in line with a previous report demonstrating an inverse relationship be - tween Purkinje cell background spike rates and PF readout ( McKay et al . , 2007 ) , and suggest that as a consequence of the activity - dependent plasticity described here , the impact of PF signaling is actually reduced despite of an increase in excitability . To directly quantify the number of ad - ditional spikes that is attributable to PF stimulation at background spike frequen - cies of 30 and 60 Hz , respectively , we adopted an analysis method that provides an estimate of the impact of a given syn - aptic input on the spike output of neurons ( Mittmann and Ha¨usser , 2007 ) . We first calculated the PSTH of the PF response patterns ( Fig . 8 D , E ) , and plotted the cu - mulative spike probability ( Fig . 8 F , G ) . Subsequently , we fitted a line to the baseline period , which was then subtracted from the cumulative probability trace . The corrected cumulative spike probability traces ( Fig . 8 H ) indicate the number of spikes that were caused by PF stimulation . The increase in spike firing attrib - utable to PF stimulation at a background spike frequency of 30 Hz is more pronounced than that observed at a background spike frequency of 60 Hz ( Fig . 8 H ) , suggesting that the impact of syn - aptic signaling is higher at a lower tonic background spike fre - quency . Over several background frequencies tested , the increase in firing caused by PF stimulation ( as a percentage ; calculated from 100 ms time periods before and after PF stimulation ) decreased with increasing spike frequencies ( Fig . 8 C , I ) . Intrinsic plasticity enhances dendritic calcium signaling , but lowers the probability for subsequent LTP induction Synaptic gain control is typically associated with LTP and LTD . To examine whether intrinsic plasticity interferes with synaptic plasticity , we tested whether the LTP induction probability was altered after previous enhancement of intrinsic excitability . In these experiments , PF - EPSPs and the spike count were moni - tored within the same sweeps ( Fig . 9 A ) . Application of the cur - rent injection protocol ( 5 Hz , 3 s ) enhanced the spike count Figure 8 . Purkinje cell intrinsic plasticity lowers the impact of PF signaling .

Subsequently , we applied the PF - LTP protocol ( 1 Hz , 5 min ) to test whether intrinsic plasticity affects LTP induction . Application of the 1 Hz PF stimulation protocol further enhanced the spike count ( 302 . 4 (cid:7) 25 . 9 % ; n (cid:6) 5 ; t (cid:6) 40 – 45 min ; p (cid:6) 0 . 00133 ) ( Fig . 9 A ) . However , when intrin - sic plasticity was triggered first , LTP could not be induced any - more by subsequent 1 Hz PF stimulation ( 104 . 5 (cid:7) 3 . 4 % ; n (cid:6) 5 ; t (cid:6) 40 – 45 min ; p (cid:6) 0 . 26 ) ( Fig . 9 A ) . This observation likely reveals a metaplastic interaction rather than a run - down of the LTP probability ( known from LTD induction ) , because in con - trol experiments , LTP could be observed after an equally long ( 20 min ) baseline period ( 121 . 3 (cid:7) 6 . 4 % ; n (cid:6) 11 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 0079 ) ( sup - plemental Fig . 9 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . The difference in EPSP amplitude changes monitored after ( 1 ) the application of the LTP protocol alone and ( 2 ) appli - cation of the LTP protocol following previous application of the current injection protocol was statistically significant ( Mann – Whitney U test ; p (cid:6) 0 . 0351 ) . For comparison , LTP induced after a shorter baseline period of 5 min amounted to 124 . 5 (cid:7) 6 . 4 % ( n (cid:6) 6 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 01 ; last 5 min ) ( Fig . 9 A ; note that an extended version of this LTP graph is shown in Fig . 1 E ) . There was no statistical difference between the LTP amplitudes reached after baseline periods of 5 min and 20 min , respectively ( Mann – Whit - ney U test ; p (cid:6) 0 . 45 ) . In these experiments , intrinsic plasticity was first triggered in the absence of synaptic alterations ( nonsynaptic induction protocol ) to be able to examine how intrinsic plasticity as an isolated phenomenon affects the LTP induction probability ( 1 Hz PF protocol ) . The results suggest that intrinsic plasticity subsequently lowers the LTP probability . An implication of these findings is that activated PF synapses can undergo both LTP and intrinsic plasticity , with the latter reducing the probability of sub - sequent LTP induction at these and potentially also at neighbor - ing , nonpotentiated synapses . To examine whether the failure to induce LTP was associated with altered spine calcium signaling , we monitored calcium tran - sients using confocal microscopy . Purkinje cells were loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator Oregon Green BAPTA - 2 ( 200 (cid:1) M ; excitation wavelength : 488 nm ) ( Fig . 9 B ) . Intrinsic plasticity was triggered by application of the current injection protocol , and was assessed as described above ( spike count ) ( Fig . 9 C ) . Den - dritic calcium transients were elicited by 100 Hz PF stimulation ( 2 – 8 pulses ) ( Fig . 9 D ) at intervals of typically 2 min ( in some experiments 0 . 5 min ) . After application of the current injection protocol , spine calcium signaling was enhanced ( Fig . 9 E , F ) . The parameter of calcium transients that was most affected was the area under the curve , whereas the peak value was only moderately enhanced ( area from 0 to 800 ms : 158 . 9 (cid:7) 25 . 8 % ; p (cid:6) 0 . 025 ; peak : 113 . 6 (cid:7) 6 . 6 % ; p (cid:6) 0 . 02 ; t (cid:6) 0 – 12 min after tetanization ; n (cid:6) 7 ) ( Fig . 9 F , G ) . In the absence of tetanization , calcium tran - sients stayed stable ( area : 93 . 4 (cid:7) 12 . 2 % ; p (cid:6) 0 . 30 ; peak : 96 . 0 (cid:7) 7 . 8 % ; p (cid:6) 0 . 32 ; n (cid:6) 7 ) ( supplemental Fig . 10 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . There was a significant differencebetweenchangesintheareaofspinecalciumtransientsaftertetanizationandthoserecordedduringthesametimepe - riod under control conditions ( Mann – Whitney U test ; area : p (cid:6) 0 . 04 ; peak : p (cid:6) 0 . 16 ) . Theincreaseincalciumtransientswasmore pronounced in spines than associated shaft regions , in which an increase was observed as well , but did not reach statistical signif - icance ( area : 129 . 7 (cid:7) 25 . 7 % ; p (cid:6) 0 . 35 ; n (cid:6) 7 ) ( Fig . 9 H ) . The change in spine calcium signaling was associated with an increase in intrinsic excitability ( 167 . 6 (cid:7) 5 . 4 % ; p (cid:6) 0 . 002 ; t (cid:6) 0 – 12 min after tetanization ; n (cid:6) 7 ) ( Fig . 9 C ) . A caveat of these experiments is that we can only provide a snapshot average of changes in calcium signaling and intrinsic excitability during a relatively short period ( 12 min ) after tetanization . This limitation results from two technical factors : ( 1 ) data acquisition was adjusted to low frequencies to minimize light exposure ( in most recordings images were taken all 2 min ) , and the calcium transients require time averaging for analysis , and ( 2 ) after 12 min post - tetani - zation , changes in baseline fluorescence prevented monitoring of comparable calcium transients for longer periods of time .

This difference could be due to differ - ences in the underlying cellular mechanisms , or simply differ - ences in the location of these alterations within Purkinje cells . Together , these observations show that intrinsic plasticity is as - sociated with an increase in spine calcium signaling that plateaus quickly after tetanization , and is most prominent for the area under the curve of calcium transients . Discussion Our study shows that the intrinsic excitability of Purkinje cells can be upregulated in an activity - dependent way both in vitro and in vivo . Intrinsic plasticity was observed when PF stimulation protocols were applied that induce PF - LTP . However , we could also trigger excitability increases using a current injection proto - col that does not elicit LTP . The intrinsic plasticity amplitude varied significantly with the stimulation and recording condi - tions used . For example , the 1 Hz protocol was very efficient in vitro , but failed to trigger intrinsic plasticity in vivo . The 100 Hz protocol induced intrinsic plasticity in vivo , but the plasticity amplitude observed was relatively small . Two factors might have contributed to this observation : ( 1 ) intact inhibition reduces the plasticity amplitude , and ( 2 ) in our in vivo recordings the back - ground spike rate was higher ( (cid:4) 40 Hz ) than in the in vitro re - cordings ( (cid:4) 25 – 30 Hz ; intact inhibition ) , which might indicate that in the in vitro recordings the available plasticity range was higher to start with . Despite this amplitude variability , it should be stressed that intrinsic plasticity was observed both in vivo and in vitro , with inhibition blocked or intact , at different ages , in rats and in mice , and using different recording conditions , demonstrating that intrinsic plasticity is a robust and physio - logical phenomenon . As intrinsic plasticity can be triggered by PF - LTP protocols , we examined whether signaling cascades involved in LTP are shared by intrinsic plasticity . In Purkinje cells , LTP is triggered by low calcium signals and the activation of PP1 , 2A , and 2B , whereas LTD is evoked by high calcium signals and the activation of PKC and (cid:2) CaMKII ( Hansel et al . , 2006 ; Jo¨rntell and Hansel , 2006 ) . Using phosphatase inhibitor drugs and L7 - PP2B knock - out mice , we observed that PP1 , 2A , and 2B are not only involved in LTP induction , but also in intrinsic plasticity . In vestibular nucleus neurons , a similar form of intrinsic plasticity has been described , which results from a downregulation of CaMKII and a reductionofBK - typeKchannels ( Nelsonetal . , 2005 ) . Wedidnot find a difference in intrinsic plasticity between (cid:2) CaMKII knock - out mice ( Hansel et al . , 2006 ) and wild - type littermates , suggest - ing that intrinsic plasticity is governed by a more complex interaction between phosphatases and kinases , such as PKA and CK2 , rather than a simple molecular PP1 / (cid:2) CaMKII switch . Ac - cordingly , it is very possible that the various phosphatases and kinases involved have several molecular targets that complement each other in mediating intrinsic plasticity . For example , it has been shown in the hippocampus that PKA regulates the surface expression of SK2 channels ( Ren et al . , 2006 ) , while CK2 reduces their calcium sensitivity ( Allen et al . , 2007 ) . It remains to be determined what precise role protein phosphatases play in intrin - sic plasticity and how they complement PKA and CK2 in regulat - ing SK2 function . Using the SK - type K channel antagonist apamin , we could show that a downregulation of SK channels partially mediates the enhancement of Purkinje cell excitability . These data are in line with the observation that intrinsic plasticity was associated with a reduction in the amplitude of the AHP ( Fig . 1 ) , which is partially mediated by apamin - sensitive SK conductances ( Edgerton and Reinhart , 2003 ; Womack and Khodakhah , 2003 ) . A caveat of our pharmacological approach is that by changing the membrane excitability , blockade of one type of channel might change the activation probability of other channels as well . It also needs to be pointed out that apamin application did not completely block intrinsic plasticity , suggesting that other conductances might ad - ditionally be altered . We therefore examined the involvement of other K conductances that have been implicated in excitability alterations . We were able to show that A - type K conductances and BK - type K conductances do not mediate this form of intrin - sic plasticity . A remaining candidate is the I h current , which can adjust Purkinje cell dendritic integration properties ( Nolan et al . , 2003 ; Angelo et al . , 2007 ) , but I h has not been examined in this study . What are the functional consequences of Purkinje cell intrin - sic plasticity ? In pyramidal cells , excitability increases and LTP complement each other : a downregulation of A - type K currents enhances the excitability of pyramidal cells and increases the LTP induction probability ( Ramakers and Storm , 2002 ; Watanabe et al . , 2002 ; Chen et al . , 2006 ) . LTP , in turn , is associated with en - hanced local excitability that decreases the spike threshold ( Daoudal et al . , 2002 ; Cudmore and Turrigiano , 2004 ) and facil - itates dendritic spike back - propagation ( Frick et al . , 2004 ) . Re - centstudiesshowthatSKchannelsplayakeyroleinhippocampalLTP : not only does a downregulation of SK channels boost cal - cium signaling and promote LTP ( Stackman et al . , 2002 ; Ngo - Anh et al . , 2005 ; Hammond et al . , 2006 ) , but LTP is associated with SK2 channel internalization , contributing to the overall EPSP increase ( Lin et al . , 2008 ) . It seems that in pyramidal cells , changes in K conductances can locally act as positive regulators of synaptic gain . A key difference between Purkinje cell intrinsic plasticity and hippocampalplasticityistheeffectonsubsequentLTPinduction . While the enhanced excitability was associated with a small , non - significant increase in PF - EPSPs ( Fig . 9 A ) , Purkinje cell intrinsic plasticity lowers the probability for subsequent LTP induction , thusdifferentiallyaffectingimmediatesynapticresponsesandtheabilitytosubsequentlymodifysynapticefficacy , respectively . A possible explanation for the reduced LTP induction probability is that intrinsic plasticity is accompanied by enhanced spine cal - cium signaling , as we demonstrated using confocal microscopy . In Purkinje cells , an amplification of calcium transients would promote LTD rather than LTP induction ( Coesmans et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , the observed failure to induce LTP , or to obtain LTD in - stead , might result from two factors : ( 1 ) the calcium transients were too large for LTP , but too low for LTD induction , or ( 2 ) the LTD induction threshold was reached , but LTD was not induced , because of wash - out effects . The calcium signal parameter that was most dramatically altered was the area under the curve , whereas the peak was enhanced to a lower degree . It remains technically possible that changes in the calcium peak amplitude were underestimated because of dye saturation . Nevertheless , the confocal imaging data allow us to conclude that intrinsic plastic - ity is associated with a significant increase in calcium signaling recruited by PF activity . Another key difference between consequences of intrinsic plasticity in Purkinje cells and pyramidal cells , respectively , is the observed alteration in the background spike rate . In contrast to pyramidal cells , which show low levels of spontaneous spike ac - tivity ( Margrie et al . , 2002 ) , Purkinje cells are characterized by Belmeguenaietal . • IntrinsicPlasticityinCerebellarPurkinjeCells J . Neurosci . , October13 , 2010 • 30 ( 41 ) : 13630 – 13643 • 13641 high spontaneous discharge rates of 30 – 80 Hz ( Simpson et al . , 1996 ) . Increases in this spontaneous spike frequency lower the signal - to - noise ratio , and thus the PF readout ( McKay et al . , 2007 ) . Here , we observed that Purkinje cell intrinsic plasticity is associated with a lasting increase in the spontaneous spike rate , which did not affect the tonic spike rate of DCN neurons , but lowered the net impact of PF signaling . Since pyramidal cells operate at far lower spontaneous spike frequencies , they cannot similarly control the impact of synaptic signaling by adjusting the background spike rate . Purkinje cell intrinsic plasticity can be triggered by PF stimu - lation protocols that also elicit LTP . Strong PF activity will there - fore induce LTP at the activated synapses , and the strengthened inputs , as much as neighboring nonpotentiated inputs , will be exposed to the enhanced excitability that accompanies LTP in - duction . Hippocampal recordings show that enhanced excitabil - ity can amplify EPSPs by removing the “brakes” imposed by SK channel activity ( Lin et al . , 2008 ) . In our study , we also observed that intrinsic plasticity ( current step protocol ) slightly enhances EPSPs ( Fig . 9 A ) and the spike output ( Fig . 8 A , B ) , but this trend did not reach significance . It seems that , if anything , the en - hanced excitability might weakly amplify EPSPs , which would particularly benefit strong , potentiated PF synapses that are likely to reach the spike threshold . In contrast , the weaker , nonpoten - tiated synapses are more strongly affected by the Purkinje cell - specific intrinsic plasticity features that rather have a negative impact on synaptic gain : ( 1 ) intrinsic plasticity lowers the prob - ability for subsequent LTP induction , thus lowering the chance forweakersynapsestobepotentiatedatalatertimepoint , and ( 2 ) the enhanced spontaneous Purkinje cell spike rate lowers the signal - to - noise ratio and reduces the PF readout , which will affect weaker PF synapses more dramatically than stronger ones . The reduced probability for subsequent LTP induction also ensures that the overall excitatory drive stays within limits after a set of synapses was potentiated . In this scenario , intrinsic plasticity closely interacts with LTP to optimally adjust the impact of PF signaling . Available data on cerebellar learning collected in vivo do not allow us to draw conclusions on the relative contribution of synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms , but provide an outlook on the physiological relevance of a potentiation of syn - aptic / intrinsic response properties . When applied in vivo , the same 100 Hz PF burst protocol used here causes a dramatic in - crease in cutaneous PF receptive fields in Purkinje cells , which can be reversed by application of an LTD protocol ( CF costimu - lation ) ( Jo¨rntell and Ekerot , 2002 ) . It is conceivable that this increase in receptive field size results from PF - LTP ( the LTD protocol only triggers a reversal when applied to the same set of PF synapses ) , but that the strengthened synapses are further ampli - fied by an associated increase in excitability ( Jo¨rntell and Hansel , 2006 ) . Moreover , mice with a Purkinje cell - specific knock - out of PP2B show impaired LTP and intrinsic plasticity , but LTD is unaf - fected . Surprisingly , these mice have severe motor learning deficits , suggestingthatbothsynapticandintrinsicpotentiationmechanismscontributetocerebellarmotorlearning ( our unpublished data ) . These observations are in line with previous notions that multiple plasticity mechanisms beyond LTD might be involved in cerebellar learning ( Raymond and Lisberger , 1998 ; Hansel et al . , 2001 ) .
