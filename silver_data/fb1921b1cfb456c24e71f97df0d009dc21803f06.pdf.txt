We study the stability of such networks with respect to crashes , such as random removal of sites . Our approach , based on percolation theory , leads to a general condition for the critical fraction of nodes , p c , that need to be removed before the network disintegrates . We show analytically and numerically that for α ≤ 3 the transition never takes place , unless the network is ﬁnite . In the special case of the physical structure of the Internet ( α ≈ 2 . 5 ) , we ﬁnd that it is impressively robust , with p c > 0 . 99 . 02 . 50 . Cw , 05 . 40 . a , 05 . 50 . + q , 64 . 60 . Ak Recently there has been increasing interest in the for - mation of random networks and in the connectivity of these networks , especially in the context of the Internet [ 1 – 8 , 10 ] . When such networks are subject to random breakdowns — a fraction p of the nodes and their con - nections are removed randomly — their integrity might be compromised : when p exceeds a certain threshold , p > p c , the network disintegrates into smaller , discon - nected parts . Below that critical threshold , there still exists a connected cluster that spans the entire system ( its size is proportional to that of the entire system ) . Random breakdown in networks can be seen as a case of inﬁnite - dimensional percolation . Two cases that have been solved exactly are Cayley trees [ 12 ] and Erd˝os - R´enyi ( ER ) random graphs [ 13 ] , where the networks collapse at known thresholds p c . Percolation on small - world net - works ( i . e . , networks where every node is connected to its neighbors , plus some random long - range connections [ 9 ] ) has also been studied by Moore and Newman [ 11 ] . Al - bert et al . , have raised the question of random failures and intentional attack on networks [ 1 ] . Here we consider random breakdown in the Internet ( and similar networks ) and introduce an analytical approach to ﬁnding the crit - ical point . The site connectivity of the physical struc - ture of the Internet , where each communication node is considered as a site , is power - law , to a good approxima - tion [ 14 ] . We introduce a new general criterion for the percolation critical threshold of randomly connected net - works . Using this criterion , we show analytically that the Internet undergoes no transition under random break - down of its nodes . In other words , a connected cluster of sites that spans the Internet survives even for arbitrarily large fractions of crashed sites . We consider networks whose nodes are connected ran - domly to each other , so that the probability for any two nodes to be connected depends solely on their respec - tive connectivity ( the number of connections emanating from a node ) . We argue that , for randomly connected networks with connectivity distribution P ( k ) , the criti - cal breakdown threshold may be found by the following criterion : if loops of connected nodes may be neglected , the percolation transition takes place when a node ( i ) , connected to a node ( j ) in the spanning cluster , is also connected to at least one other node — otherwise the spanning cluster is fragmented . This may be written as h k i | i ↔ j i = X k i k i P ( k i | i ↔ j ) = 2 , ( 1 ) where the angular brackets denote an ensemble average , k i is the connectivity of node i , and P ( k i | i ↔ j ) is the conditional probability that node i has connectiv - ity k i , given that it is connected to node j . But , by Bayes rule for conditional probabilities P ( k i | i ↔ j ) = P ( k i , i ↔ j ) / P ( i ↔ j ) = P ( i ↔ j | k i ) P ( k i ) / P ( i ↔ j ) , where P ( k i , i ↔ j ) is the joint probability that node i has connectivity k i and that it is connected to node j . For randomly connected networks ( neglecting loops ) P ( i ↔ j ) = h k i / ( N − 1 ) and P ( i ↔ j | k i ) = k i / ( N − 1 ) , where N is the total number of nodes in the network . It follows that the criterion ( 1 ) is equivalent to κ ≡ h k 2 i h k i = 2 , ( 2 ) at criticality . Loops can be ignored below the percolation transition , κ < 2 , because the probability of a bond to form a loop in an s - nodes cluster is proportional to ( s / N ) 2 ( i . e . , pro - portional to the probability of choosing two sites in that cluster ) . The fraction of loops in the system P loop is P loop ∝ X i s 2 i N 2 < X i s i S N 2 = S N , ( 3 ) where the sum is taken over all clusters , and s i is the size of the i th cluster . Thus , the overall fraction of loops in ∗ e - mail : cohenr @ shoshi . ph . biu . ac . il 1 the system is smaller than S / N , where S is the size of the largest existing cluster . Below criticality S is smaller than order N ( for ER graphs S is of order ln N [ 13 ] ) , so the fraction of loops becomes negligible in the limit of N → ∞ . Similar arguments apply at criticality . Consider now a random breakdown of a fraction p of the nodes . This would generically alter the connec - tivity distribution of a node . Consider indeed a node with initial connectivity k 0 , chosen from an initial dis - tribution P ( k 0 ) . After the random breakdown the dis - tribution of the new connectivity of the node becomes (cid:0) k 0 k (cid:1) ( 1 − p ) k p k 0 − k , and the new distribution is P ′ ( k ) = ∞ X k 0 = k P ( k 0 ) (cid:18) k 0 k (cid:19) ( 1 − p ) k p k 0 − k . ( 4 ) ( Quantities after the breakdown are denoted by a prime . ) Using this new distribution one obtains h k i ′ = h k 0 i ( 1 − p ) and h k 2 i ′ = h k 2 0 i ( 1 − p ) 2 + h k 0 i p ( 1 − p ) , so the criterion ( 2 ) for criticality may be re - expressed as h k 20 i h k 0 i ( 1 − p c ) + p c = 2 , ( 5 ) or 1 − p c = 1 κ 0 − 1 , ( 6 ) where κ 0 = h k 20 i / h k 0 i is computed from the original dis - tribution , before the random breakdown . Our discussion up to this point is general and applica - ble to all randomly connected networks , regardless of the speciﬁc form of the connectivity distribution ( and pro - vided that loops may be neglected ) . For example , for random ( ER ) networks , which possess a Poisson connec - tivity distribution , the criterion ( 2 ) reduces to a known result [ 13 ] that the transition takes place at h k i = 1 . In this case , random breakdown does not alter the Poisson character of the distribution , but merely shifts its mean . Thus , the new system is again an ER network , but with new eﬀective parameters : k eﬀ = k ( 1 − p ) , N eﬀ = N ( 1 − p ) . In the case of Cayley trees , the criteria ( 2 ) and ( 6 ) also yield the known exact results [ 12 ] . The case of the Internet is thought to be diﬀerent . It is widely believed that , to a good approximation , the connectivity distribution of the Internet nodes follows a power - law [ 14 ] : P ( k ) = ck − α , k = m , m + 1 , . . . , K , ( 7 ) where α ≈ 5 / 2 , c is an appropriate normalization con - stant , and m is the smallest possible connectivity . In a ﬁnite network , the largest connectivity , K , can be esti - mated from Z ∞ K P ( k ) dk = 1 N , ( 8 ) yielding K ≈ mN 1 / ( α − 1 ) . ( For the Internet , m = 1 and K ≈ N 2 / 3 . ) For the sake of generality , below we consider a range of variables , α ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ m ≪ K . The key parameter , according to ( 6 ) , is the ratio of second - to ﬁrst - moment , κ 0 , which we compute by approximating the distribution ( 7 ) to a continuum ( this approximation becomes exact for 1 ≪ m ≪ K , and it preserves the essential features of the transition even for small m ) : κ 0 = (cid:18) 2 − α 3 − α (cid:19) K 3 − α − m 3 − α K 2 − α − m 2 − α . ( 9 ) When K ≫ m , this may be approximated as : κ 0 → (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 2 − α 3 − α (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ×   m , if α > 3 ; m α − 2 K 3 − α , if 2 < α < 3 ; K , if 1 < α < 2 . ( 10 ) We see that for α > 3 the ratio κ 0 is ﬁnite and there is a percolation transition at 1 − p c = (cid:0) α − 2 α − 3 m − 1 (cid:1) − 1 : for p > p c the spanning cluster is fragmented and the network is destroyed . However , for α < 3 the ratio κ 0 di - verges with K and so p c → 1 when K → ∞ ( or N → ∞ ) . The percolation transition does not take place : a span - ning cluster exists for arbitrarily large fractions of break - down , p < 1 . In ﬁnite systems a transition is always observed , though for α < 3 the transition threshold is exceedingly high . For the case of the Internet ( α ≈ 5 / 2 ) , we have κ 0 ≈ K 1 / 2 ≈ N 1 / 3 . Considering the enormous size of the Internet , N > 10 6 , one needs to destroy over 99 % of the nodes before the spanning cluster collapses . The transition is illustrated by the computer simula - tion results shown in Fig . 1 , where we plot the frac - tion of nodes which remain in the spanning cluster , P ∞ ( p ) / P ∞ ( 0 ) , as a function of the fraction of random breakdown , p , for networks with the distribution ( 7 ) . For α = 3 . 5 , the transition is clearly visible : beyond p c ≈ 0 . 5 the spanning cluster collapses and P ∞ ( p ) / P ∞ ( 0 ) is nearly zero . On the other hand , the plots for α = 2 . 5 ( the case of the Internet ) show that although the spanning cluster is diluted as p increases ( P ∞ ( p ) / P ∞ ( 0 ) becomes smaller ) , it remains connected even at near 100 % breakdown . Data for several system sizes illustrate the ﬁnite - size eﬀect : the transition occurs at higher values of p the larger the sim - ulated network . The Internet size is comparable to our largest simulation , making it remarkably resilient to ran - dom breakdown . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 p 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 P ∞ ( p ) / P ∞ ( 0 ) FIG . 1 . Percolation transition for networks with power - law connectivity distribution . Plotted is the fraction of nodes that remain in the spanning cluster after breakdown of a fraction p of all nodes , P ∞ ( p ) / P ∞ ( 0 ) , as a function of p , for α = 3 . 5 ( crosses ) and α = 2 . 5 ( other symbols ) , as obtained from computer simulations of up to N = 10 6 . In the former case , it can be seen that for p > p c ≈ 0 . 5 the spanning cluster disintegrates and the network becomes fragmented . However , for α = 2 . 5 ( the case of the Internet ) , the spanning cluster persists up to nearly 100 % breakdown . The diﬀerent curves for K = 25 ( circles ) , 100 ( squares ) , and 400 ( triangles ) illus - trate the ﬁnite size - eﬀect : the transition exists only for ﬁnite networks , while the critical threshold p c approaches 100 % as the networks grow in size . We have introduced a general criterion for the collapse of randomly connected networks under random removal of their nodes . This criterion , when applied to the In - ternet , shows that the Internet is resilient to random breakdown of its nodes : a cluster of interconnected sites which spans the whole Internet becomes more dilute with increasing breakdowns , but it remains essentially con - nected even for nearly 100 % breakdown . The same is true for other networks whose connectivity distribution is approximately described by a power - law , as in Eq . ( 7 ) , as long as α < 3 .
