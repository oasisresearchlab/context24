While many use AAC efectively , much research has highlighted chal - lenges – for instance , high rates of abandonment and solutions which are not appropriate for their end - users . Presently , we lack a detailed survey of this feld to comprehend these shortcomings and understand how the accessibility community might direct its eforts to design more efective AAC . In response to this , we con - duct a systematic review and taxonomy of high - tech AAC devices and interventions , reporting results from 562 articles identifed in the ACM DL and SCOPUS databases . We provide a taxonomical overview of the current state of AAC devices – e . g . their interac - tion modalities and characteristics . We describe the communities of focus explored , and the methodological approaches used . We contrast fndings in the broader accessibility and HCI literature to delineate future avenues for exploration in light of the current tax - onomy , ofer a reassessment of the norms and incumbent research methodologies and present a discourse on the communities of focus for AAC and interventions .

Equally , communication and freedom of speech is protected un - der UN legislature [ 120 ] and revered as the very “ essence of hu - man life ” [ 105 ] . Aided and unaided AAC strategies and systems serve to remediate communication difculties experienced by in - dividuals and communities with complex communication needs ( CCNs ) [ 126 ] . In particular , high - tech aided AAC devices encap - sulate the most advanced electronic AAC technology for example speech generating devices ( SGDs ) or voice output communication aids ( VOCAs ) [ 42 ] . Data on the prevalence of specifcally high - tech AAC is limited , however there will be an increase in the number of individuals requiring AAC interventions [ 9 , 107 , 135 ] . Also , there has been sustained academic research into high - tech AAC devices and interventions since the formation of the International Society for AAC ( ISAAC ) in 1983 and the AAC journal in 1985 [ 155 , 183 ] . Since then , high - tech AAC has been developed to support wide age ranges [ 106 ] and serve many communities [ 135 ] . In many cases , high - tech AAC devices and interventions have contributed to pos - itive and successful outcomes for individuals with CCNs whilst advances in computer technology , machine learning ( ML ) and ar - tifcial intelligence ( AI ) hold much promise for future high - tech AAC [ 140 , 185 ] . 1 . 1 High - tech AAC Device Abandonment and Fellow Systematic Reviews Numerous HCI researchers , including Bircanin et al . [ 20 ] , Ibrahim et al . [ 81 ] , Norrie et al . [ 140 ] have noted that high - tech AAC de - vices too often experience a high rate of abandonment amongst their target community . The reasons for abandonment of high - tech AAC devices are far ranging and vary dependent on the community and intervention circumstances [ 140 ] . However , research has found that high - tech AAC devices can be frustrating to use , unreliable , slow [ 92 , 140 ] and inefective for certain common communication interactions leading to breakdowns and misalignments [ 81 , 92 ] . Other problems noted by research include that high - tech AAC devices carry a stigma [ 128 ] , are too expensive [ 65 ] , hard to pro - gram [ 33 ] and inconsiderate of cultural factors [ 100 ] – making high - tech AAC devices simultaneously challenging for their users , close caregivers , specialists and wider communities to adopt . At the same time high - tech AAC has often been found to inadequately adapt to their users communication strengths and weakness or ofer pathways for multimodal or embodied forms of communica - tion [ 81 ] . In light of these criticisms , we believe it is important to refect on the full body of high - tech AAC research with a systematic review ( SR ) of the literature and taxonomic overview of devices ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece Curtis et al . fostering novel pathways for improving high - tech AAC devices , interventions and research . There are several pre - existing SRs into AAC , which typically fo - cus on research interventions for specifc communities and groups . Beukelman et al . , studied AAC interventions for adults with neu - rological conditions [ 17 ] , Biggs et al . , reviewed interventions for children with CCNs [ 19 ] , both Holyfeld et al . , and Logan et al . , ex - amined AAC interventions amongst people with autism ( ASD ) [ 77 , 111 ] , van der Meer et al . , analysed interventions for individuals with developmental disabilities ( IDDs ) [ 182 ] and Simacek et al . , focused on AAC interventions amongst individuals with multiple disabilities [ 165 ] . Lastly , Moorcroft et al . , assessed research on bar - riers in the provision of low - tech and unaided AAC [ 130 ] . Some SRs have even focused specifcally on high - tech AAC devices and interventions . Baxter et al . , conducted two reviews of high - tech AAC interventions , barriers and facilitators [ 11 , 12 ] . Whilst , the re - maining high - tech AAC reviews focus on interventions in specifc communities and groups . Morin et al . , provided a meta - analysis of AAC interventions for people with IDDs [ 131 ] , Still et al . , exam - ined interventions for people with ASD [ 170 ] and lastly Ju et al . , considered high - tech AAC interventions amongst ICU patients [ 89 ] . Despite this previous research , at present there is not a broad survey of the literature including analysis of the earliest and latest high - tech AAC research . Consequently , this review and taxonomy will look to supplement the following three research gaps vacated by the previous SRs . Firstly , previous SRs were focused on clinical practice over HCI and device - orientated development – failing to establish a taxonomy of high - tech AAC , which supports the development of future generations of devices . Secondly , previous SRs did not track the prevailing research methods and capture data on the studies undertaken . Thirdly , previous SRs have not captured broad data on which communities have comparatively currently received the most high - tech AAC research . Additionally , the SRs predate the recent criticisms of high - tech AAC ( c . f . [ 20 , 81 , 140 ] ) and ofer no comparison with the Mack et al . fndings from reviewing accessibility research [ 112 ] . 1 . 2 Research Questions and Contributions To focus our contribution we initially developed three research questions : RQ1 : What is the current taxonomy and dominant characteristics of high - tech AAC ? RQ2 : What research methods are used to contribute towards the design and study of high - tech AAC devices and interven - tions ? RQ3 : Who does high - tech AAC devices and interventions focus on ? The three research questions support the review and analysis of previous high - tech AAC research – quantitatively evaluating the design of devices , methodologies and communities of focus . The research questions capture data to enable the identifcation of notable research gaps , development of strategic directions for future research and support cross - comparison with the Mack et al . , research [ 112 ] . Thereby supporting more novel , successful and long - term high - tech AAC interventions . To answer these three research questions , mapped in Figure 1 , we have four contributions in this paper : ( 1 ) We have built an open - source data - set of 562 coded papers from 1978 - 2021 focused on research into high - tech AAC de - vices and interventions encompassing peer - reviewed articles using 2021 PRISMA guidelines [ 153 ] . ( 2 ) We present the frst SR and taxonomy of high - tech aided AAC devices within the ACM literature . The taxonomy of high - tech AAC was developed in three ways : ( a ) collecting an inventory of the interaction experience through coding high - tech AAC devices’ input and outputs ( b ) understanding the features of high - tech AAC devices through coding the interface layout and scalar attributes ( c ) understanding the communication facilitated via coding the communication model / type facilitated by the device . ( 3 ) We provide an analysis of the methodologies , roles , and communities of focus within high - tech AAC interventions and research . This data is then cross - analysed with the Mack et al . SR of accessibility research [ 112 ] , which we consider to be normative standards for accessible computing research – to gain an understanding of similarities and diferences with wider accessibility research . ( 4 ) We provide implications for future research on high - tech AAC devices and interventions . In the discussion , we identify directions for future scientifc investigations and high - tech AAC development . With almost 40 years of preceding re - search , we consider this contribution signifcant for new researchers to improve the development of future high - tech AAC devices and decrease the current high rates of aban - donment [ 81 ] . 2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK We outline the key related work on SRs of high - tech AAC and frame our work in communication research ; discussing the models and types of communication for developing the codebook . 2 . 1 Related Work in High - tech AAC Although no SR and taxonomy of high - tech AAC has been pub - lished within the ACM literature , previous research has explored the design and barriers of high - tech AAC [ 11 , 12 , 166 ] . Plus , previous research has considered specifc sub - areas including high - tech AAC interventions for aphasia [ 181 ] , autism [ 170 ] and ICU patients 1 [ 89 ] . 2 . 1 . 1 Related Taxonomies and Investigations of AAC Design and Barriers . The closest contribution to a taxonomy for high - tech AAC is a paper by Belani presenting a usability requirements taxonomy for mobile AAC services [ 14 ] . Belani’s taxonomy inherits from sys - tems engineering and focuses on accessible software principles : the context of AAC usage , user relations and the principles of simplicity , supplementing and trustworthiness [ 14 ] . Furthermore , this taxon - omy tries to develop a set of augmentative requirements difering from our systematic investigation of the pre - existing literature and consequent device taxonomy 2 [ 14 , 30 ] . Barriers and facilitators of 1 Critical research has considered the efcacy of high - tech AAC through consumer perspectives [ 24 ] and as an evidence based practice [ 131 ] . 2 See Brudy et al . ’s , taxonomy of the cross - device computing domain [ 30 ] . State of the Art in AAC ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece Figure 1 : Flow diagram presenting an overview of the fg - ures and tabular contribution towards each research ques - tion . 1 . 2 : Figure 4 and Tables 2 , 3 , 4 . 1 . 2 : Figures 5 , 6 and Ta - bles 6 , 7 , 8 . 1 . 2 : Tables 9 , 10 , 11 . high - tech AAC are explored in 2 SRs by Baxter et al . [ 11 , 12 ] . In their frst SR of 27 papers , they identifed several key themes – 11 papers described the limited reliability of high - tech AAC devices , 8 papers highlighted the difculties of learning how to operate de - vices and 6 papers discussed inappropriate voices / words generated by devices within specifc cultural contexts 3 [ 11 ] . Turning to their second and more extensive SR of 65 papers and interventions from 2000 - 10 [ 12 ] . In order of frequency , Baxter et al . report that the most common community of focus for high - tech AAC interventions were 14 studies focused on aphasia from non - progressive causes , 13 focused on interventions with people with autism disorder ( ASD ) , 12 considered interventions for adults with cerebral palsy whilst other communities faced a smaller subset 4 [ 12 ] . 2 . 1 . 2 Sub - areas of High - tech AAC . SRs considering sub - areas of high - tech AAC interventions to a greater extent report optimistic results . For people with aphasia ( PWA ) , Sandt - Koenderman’s SR emphasised the need for AAC devices to be “tailor made” , taking advantage of PWAs residual language skills and communicative strengths [ 181 ] . In contrast , Still et al . perform an SR focused on 3 Secondary themes from the research include needs for staf training , limitations of technical support , decision difculties faced by families whilst selecting an AAC device and negative communication rates with the AAC device [ 11 ] . 4 Other fndings of the research include that devices were found to be benefcial in enhancing communication across a broad range of diagnoses and age ranges [ 12 ] . high - tech AAC interventions for individuals under the age of six - teen with ASD [ 170 ] . They found portable SGDs have been fre - quently favoured for interventions – in particular , iPod and iPad - based applications and intervention results were positive for teach - ing requesting skills [ 170 ] . Within a hospital setting for voiceless ICU patients , Ju et al . performed an SR considering adoption and efects of a high - tech AAC intervention [ 89 ] . From the 18 stud - ies qualitatively synthesised with the TAM model , they found that high - tech AAC was easy to learn and use in most studies – with customisation and portability of devices most important for pa - tients [ 89 ] . For future positive development of high - tech AAC tech - nologies , they encouraged further collaboration directly with ICU staf and patients [ 89 ] . Although not specifcally high - tech AAC research , broader accessibility scholarship has ofered meaningful refection that should shape future high - tech AAC interventions . Scholars have accepted the importance of not “ medicalizing ” dis - ability 5 [ 45 , 112 ] . In this vein , AAC devices should not serve as assistive technologies to fx people living with communication dis - orders . Bennett et al . [ 15 ] have efectively conceptualised this form of technology through a notion of independence – in which the high - tech AAC device itself incorrectly serves as a dependent in - terface to communicating with the environment and others 6 [ 15 ] . Instead , we believe high - tech AAC should be guided by Bennett et al . ’s interdependence framing of assistive technology ( AT ) – re - framing high - tech AAC as an assistive technology ( AT ) that all can freely engage and leverage to interface and communicate with the environment [ 15 ] . 2 . 2 Models and Types of Communication High - tech AAC is developed based upon our understanding of com - munication and models of successful communication exchanges between human parties . Here , we discuss three recognised models of communication and two types of communication – this scholar - ship directly infuenced the categories and sub - codes used in our taxonomy of devices and high - tech AAC codebook . 2 . 2 . 1 Models of Communication . The most basic model of com - munication that high - tech AAC can support is the original model of communication i . e . Shannon - Weaver sender - receiver or Linear model [ 161 ] . The model consists of just four parts 7 and mirrors the functioning of radio and telephone technology – for instance the sender delivers a message using a high - tech AAC device , the chan - nel is the AAC device speaker , and the receiver hears the sender’s message [ 161 ] . Within this model , information is solely transmitted between the two parties . Yet , Ibrahim et al . , have criticised high - tech AAC devices that exclusively support sender - receiver and linear communication [ 81 ] . Emphasising Kraat et al . ’s research [ 98 ] , Ibrahim et al . argue that high - tech AAC communication should be much more dynamic made up of people , the setting , rules of language use and situated within the context [ 81 ] . In contrast , the Interactive model ofers more dynamic communication . Here , high - tech AAC supports the feedback fow between sender and receiver 5 Mankof et al . , has called for greater representation of disabled people in accessibility research – in the same vein as Mack et al . , we provide some empirical metrics of representation within our dataset [ 112 , 114 ] . 6 Limiting the AAC users’ autonomy , perpetuating social stigma and increasing marginalization by exacerbating social diferences . 7 These parts are : ( 1 ) sender , ( 2 ) message , ( 3 ) channel , and ( 4 ) receiver . ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece Curtis et al . – feedback can be verbal ( i . e . , “yes” or " no " or nonverbal i . e . , a nod or smile ) [ 190 ] . However , the feedback provided by the high - tech AAC is not simultaneous and can be potentially slow or indirect . Lastly , the Transactional model is the most dynamic – senders and receivers are now considered communicators [ 10 ] . Now , high - tech AAC communication is a co - created process with instantaneous feedback between parties [ 10 ] . Although challenging , high - tech AAC must look to support interactive and even transactional com - munication where communication is an embodied , meaningful and multimodal experience for its users [ 81 ] . 2 . 2 . 2 Types of Communication . Broadly there are two exclusive types of communication , which high - tech AAC can enrich : non - verbal and verbal 8 . Verbal communication is the use of words to convey a message whether that be written or dialogue [ 84 ] . Ex - amples of verbal communication include oral forms i . e . , speech and written forms e . g . , letters and text messages [ 84 ] . In contrast , non - verbal communication explains the processes that convey a message in a form of non - linguistic representations [ 75 ] . Examples of non - verbal include gestures , sign language , facial expression , and eye contact [ 75 ] . Most high - tech AAC devices do not equally support both types of communication . High - tech AAC to augment and enhance users’ verbal communication has taken precedence over supporting non - verbal forms [ 180 ] . Instead , high - tech AAC should consider and enhance both types of communication for successful outcomes [ 80 ] . For instance , Valencia et al . ’s physical expressive objects successfully increase augmentative communica - tors ( ACs ) agency in conversations with unfamiliar partners using solely non - verbal messages and signals [ 52 , 180 ] . 3 METHODS In this paper we followed PRISMA 2021 9 procedures for SRs [ 153 ] with secondary support from Siddaway et al . [ 162 ] and Silva et al . ’s SR guidelines [ 164 ] . Firstly , we consider the scope of our investiga - tion via defning high - tech AAC . Secondly , we discuss methods for creating a dataset using PRISMA guidelines . Thirdly , we describe the qualitative , quantitative and programmatic analysis methods of this study . 3 . 1 Scope We start by presenting our defnition of high - tech AAC devices and interventions . AAC comes in many forms to support a variety of communities and needs - therefore a clear defnition for the scope is signifcant [ 18 ] . Unaided AAC interventions use no equipment i . e . , signing or body language [ 130 ] . For unaided AAC research there are several pre - existing SRs , such as : [ 130 ] . By contrast , aided 3 . 2 Dataset Establishment AAC interventions encompasses any enabling aids or technologies used to support or replace communication for those with CCNs thereby enriching the production or comprehension of communi - cation [ 126 ] . However , this equipment comes in a wide variety of form factors [ 18 ] . Aided AAC devices are categorised as no , low , medium and high - tech [ 18 ] . Low - tech AAC devices do not require electricity or battery power [ 130 ] . Typically , they are simple props 8 Sometimes re - conceptualised with more types of communication considered such as written or visual . 9 The PRISMA acronym stands for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta - Analyses . to foster communication such head / mouth sticks to enable point - ing , pen , paper , and eraser boards for drawing or writing to even customised analogue systems such as communication boards and books [ 130 ] . Medium - tech AAC devices encapsulate very simple electronic devices with basic technology [ 142 ] . Examples include battery powered switches or buttons that communicate one or two messages , an LED light , or appropriated technology devices such as motion toys , radios , and fans [ 142 ] . Therefore , high - tech aided AAC devices encapsulate the most advanced electronic AAC tech - nology with multi - message vocabularies – for example , SGDs or VOCAs [ 17 ] . High - tech AAC devices vary in shape and size , poten - tially with dynamic displays for depicting letters , words , phrases , pictures and / or symbols that the communicator navigates to ex - press messages [ 4 ] . They difer in size , weight , and portability as well as access methods – either direct selection of a screen / keyboard with a body part , pointer , or eye gaze adapted mouse / joystick or indirect selection forms such as switches and scanning [ 18 , 46 , 142 ] . Our operational defnition of high - tech AAC is established by the following three requirements : Req1 : Our scope addresses AAC research . AAC encompasses tools and strategies that individuals use to supplement communi - cation [ 42 ] . Communication is multimodal and takes many forms i . e . , speech , glance , text , gestures , facial expressions , sign language , symbols , pictures , SGDs etc . contingent upon the context and communication partner [ 98 ] . Req2 : The paper must research aided AAC interventions and de - vices . Aided AAC serves as hardware or software that is used to supplement , enrich , or replace communication . Aided AAC can take many forms and is categorised as low , medium or high - tech . Req3 : The paper must address high - tech aided AAC interventions . High - tech AAC refers to any AAC hardware , device , tools , software or technologies powered by electricity that permits the storage and retrieval of multiple electronic messages to support or enrich the users communication . Requirements 3 . 1 to 3 . 1 specify the scope of our investigation . We wanted to focus on AAC research for individuals with CCNs . How - ever , within this broad domain , we narrowed towards aided AAC tools and devices deliberately designed to enrich verbal and nonver - bal communication rather than unaided forms or systems . Equally , we wanted to focus specifcally on high - tech aided interventions , meaning our scope avoids appropriated devices or low - tech forms of AAC . There are many ways to conduct SRs , but to derive solutions for our three research questions ( i . e . , 1 . 2 – 1 . 2 ) we harnessed methods de - tailed in PRISMA 2021 guidelines for reporting meta - analyses [ 153 ] . We describe in detail the following : identifcation , screening , eligi - bility and snowballing depicted in Figure 3 . 3 . 2 . 1 Identification . The role of the identifcation stage is to cap - ture work that addresses the three research questions by performing queries of the relevant scientifc databases . We chose the ACM DL 10 10 https : / / dl . acm . org State of the Art in AAC ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece Figure 2 : Flow diagram providing the scope of our investigation on high - tech AAC devices and interventions . For greater detail please refer to 3 . 1 , 3 . 1 and 3 . 1 detailed within the text . Figure 3 : The PRISMA diagram [ 153 ] illustrating the reference frequencies of identifcation , screening , eligibility , snowballing and inclusion stages of our SR and taxonomy of high - tech AAC devices and interventions . and SCOPUS 11 as two major electronic databases for Computer Sci - ence and AAC research . Initially , we performed some preparatory searches to broadly investigate the search space – before commit - ting to a defnitive search strategy . From this initial investigation , we identifed that the ACM database provided essential HCI papers yet failed to include key research papers from the academic liter - ature – such as the AAC journal . In contrast , SCOPUS ofered a broader search space containing literature from the AAC journal and several other prominent venues for high - tech AAC literature . For deciding keywords , we performed an analysis of the research questions and extracted initial keywords – utilising these , we then collectively iterated several times to produce synonyms for more keywords including acronyms and common named high - tech AAC devices e . g . , voice output communication aids and speech generating devices . We then developed methods to avoid returning high quan - tities of false - positive papers – for instance , we decided to search just title , abstract and keywords . Additionally , within the search string we concatenated the keywords with OR plus AND connec - tors to ensure the ordering of the terminology was coherent and asterisks were liberally used to enable multiple and plural forms of the keywords . For the ACM DL , the fnal query was : 11 https : / / www . scopus . com / ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece Curtis et al . " query " : { Title : ( ( aac ) OR ( augment * AND alternat * AND communicat * ) OR ( comput * AND assist * AND communicat * ) OR ( voice * AND output * AND communicat * AND aid * ) OR ( alternat * AND augment * AND communicat * ) OR ( speech * AND generat * AND device * ) ) OR Abstract : ( ( aac ) OR ( augment * AND alternat * AND communicat * ) OR ( voice * AND output * AND communicat * AND aid * ) OR ( alternat * AND augment * AND communicat * ) OR ( speech * AND generat * AND device * ) ) OR Keyword ( ( aac ) OR ( augment * AND alternat * AND communicat * ) OR ( comput * AND assist * AND communicat * ) OR ( alternat * AND augment * AND communicat * ) OR ( voice * AND output * AND communicat * AND aid * ) OR ( speech * AND generat * AND device * ) ) } The ACM query returned 462 results . For the SCOPUS database we queried solely the title feld because initial testing with the abstract and keyword felds resulted in too many false positives – meaning featureless , large search spaces exceeding 20 , 000 papers . Additionally , we performed an abstraction based on venue for the SCOPUS query to limit the state space and number of papers . The fnal relevant selected venues were titled with : AAC , technology , aphasia , language and communication disorder . Meaning the fnal SCOPUS query was : ( TITLE - ABS - KEY ( aac ) OR TITLE - ABS - KEY ( voice * AND output * AND communicat * AND aid * ) OR TITLE - ABS - KEY ( speech * AND generat * AND device * ) OR TITLE - ABS - KEY ( alternat * AND augment * AND communicat * ) OR TITLE - ABS - KEY ( augment * AND alternat * AND communicat * ) ) AND ( LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " AAC Augmentative And Alternative Communication " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Lecture Notes In Computer Science Including Subseries Lecture Notes In Artificial Intelligence And Lecture Notes In Bioinformatics " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Augmentative And Alternative Communication " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Disability And Rehabilitation Assistive Technology " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Communication Disorders Quarterly " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Assistive Technology " ) were then only removed from the dataset once the two authors had come to agreement . This screening process resulted in 1 , 288 papers remaining in the dataset . 3 . 2 . 3 Eligibility . Following PRISMA guidelines – we formulated a set of four eligibility criteria ( 3 . 2 . 3 through to 3 . 2 . 3 ) to further flter out work irrelevant to the scope of our systematic literature review and domain : EC1 : Availability of full - text . The full - text research paper is avail - able and written in English to be accessible for the research team . EC2 : Peer - reviewed academic research . The research must be peer reviewed literature and academic . E . g . , journal articles , con - ference papers , and PhD dissertations . Other media forms would be excluded . EC3 : Aided AAC research and interventions . The paper had to clearly focus on aided AAC interventions – an AAC aid is any device that is electronic or not , which is harnessed to transmit and receive messages . In contrast , unaided AAC interventions are those that do not require external tools e . g . , sign languages . EC4 : High - tech AAC interventions . The paper must include re - search on high - tech aided AAC interventions . As defned earlier , high - tech refers to the most advanced forms of aided AAC – that being electronic devices that enable the retrieval and storage of electronic messages to support and enrich communication . There are a variety of high - tech AAC de - vices in a multitude of diferent forms : such as a dedicated device like a DynaVox e . g . , [ 4 ] , tablet and smartphone apps e . g . , [ 124 ] , brain computer interfaces ( BCI ) e . g . , [ 59 ] and even wearables e . g . , [ 54 ] . We wanted to incorporate as much of this emergent literature as possible to provide an encompass - ing analysis of high - tech AAC research . OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " International Journal Of Language And Communication Disorders " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Advances In Intelligent Systems And Computing " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Conference On Human Factors In Computing Systems Proceedings " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Topics In Language Disorders " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Technology And Disability " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Aphasiology " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Assistive Technology Research Series " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Communications In Computer And Information Science " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Journal Of Special Education Technology " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Studies In Health Technology And Informatics " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Communication Sciences And Disorders " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " Pervasivehealth Pervasive Computing Technologies For Healthcare " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " ACM Transactions On Accessible Computing " ) OR LIMIT - TO ( EXACTSRCTITLE , " International Journal Of Speech Technology " ) ) The SCOPUS query returned 1 , 531 papers in total . All queries were run on the 05 / 11 / 2021 and returned a combined 1 , 993 papers in total from 1978 - 2021 . 3 . 2 . 2 Screening . A quick scan of dataset titles revealed that some of the 1 , 993 were out of scope and required manual removal during the subsequent process of screening . Firstly , we discovered 39 du - plicates and eliminated them from our dataset . Secondly , we read titles , abstracts and keywords – removing papers not focused on high - tech AAC research . Consequently , 595 of the results were not papers within the research area and focused on factors such as : advanced audio coding e . g . , [ 38 ] , digital content distribution e . g . , [ 95 ] , communication routing algorithms e . g . , [ 139 ] and pro - teins amino acid composition e . g . , [ 188 ] . A further 67 results were clearly not full - text papers i . e . , conference proceedings and 4 pa - pers were removed for not being in English . Throughout screening , an explanation fle was developed where the frst author provided an index , reason , and explanation for the suggested removal of a paper from the dataset . Subsequently , the second author reviewed the dataset and explanation fle for quality control purposes – to jointly discuss any highlighted papers promulgating uncertainty and verify removal suggestions made by the frst author . Papers The eligibility process involved the frst author initially labelling papers as in , out or unsure . Consequently from the 1288 papers – 490 papers were included , 723 papers were excluded for failing to meet eligibility criteria ( 3 . 2 . 3 to 3 . 2 . 3 ) and 75 labelled as unsure . Checks on the labelling were performed by the second author and followed by lengthy discussions on the unsure papers . Then from the unsure papers 44 were included with a further 31 papers ex - cluded . Once all procedures were completed , 534 papers remained in the dataset for manual qualitative coding meaning in total 754 papers had been excluded . 3 . 2 . 4 Snowballing . Snowballing identifed a further 28 papers on the topic of high - tech AAC consisting of peer reviewed literature from 1992 - 2021 . Following guidance from Wohlin , we performed snowballing iterations until dead ends were reached and no new candidate papers were identifed from forward or backward snow - balling every paper [ 196 ] . The process of snowballing took 3 itera - tions until Wohlin’s efciency metric reached 0 % [ 196 ] . Through this , we identifed 44 potential candidate papers from titles and abstracts , yet upon further inspection all did not meet our eligi - bility criteria for inclusion . After applying these , just 28 papers were added to our dataset . Backward snowballing gave 18 papers by studying the references of selected papers . Forward snowballing 12 12 Each paper labelled as out – failed eligibility criteria was noted . State of the Art in AAC ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece presented 10 papers by studying the works cited utilising Google Scholar . After snowballing our dataset was 562 papers in total . 3 . 3 Analysis Analysis involved qualitative coding of the entire dataset and cal - culating Fleiss’s Kappa inter - rater reliability ( IRR ) [ 53 ] to reach agreement between the three authors . Following this , we program - matically examined paper counts over the 43 - year period , per - formed quantitative data extractions for participant counts , de - veloped an inventory of key high - tech AAC devices and analyzed corresponding results found by the Mack et al . , dataset [ 112 ] . 3 . 3 . 1 Qalitative Analysis of the Dataset . We qualitatively coded all 562 papers from 1978 - 2021 . The process of coding and analysing the dataset was performed by 3 scholars . We note that the proce - dure of building and analyzing the dataset involved subjectivity and we appreciate that our scholarship refects our own biases and beliefs . Authors and coders identifed as male and female of Western and Southern European backgrounds , with no accessibility needs . The codebook is synthesized to provide data for our three research questions ( i . e . , 1 . 2 , 1 . 2 and 1 . 2 ) . Shown in Table 1 , the fnal code - book included 16 categories with 2 - 10 subcodes each . Out of the 16 categories , 8 were developed by the research team and 8 based upon the Mack et al . , codebook for accessibility research [ 112 ] . The 8 categories adapted from the Mack et al . , were to cross - analyse high - tech AAC research with current normative accessibility stan - dards . In contrast , the 8 categories from the research team focused on establishing a taxonomy and understanding of the dominant characteristics of high - tech AAC devices . We wanted to code the features and role of the device – its commercialism , inputs / outputs , scalar attributes , communication types / model and scenarios of us - age . This data would taxonomise and provide an understanding of the current characteristics of high - tech AAC devices . The codes were iterated by two authors using an iterative inductive analysis approach – in which codes were independently developed and f - nally agreed between both parties . Indeed , the two authors would regularly meet – to refne and eliminate existing codes or add new codes . Qualitative coding took three months and IRR was calculated between the three authors – to mitigate against bias and fatigue . The second and third author retrospectively coded a random sam - ple of 10 % ( N = 60 ) of the dataset to provide a Fleiss Kappa IRR and provide an opportunity for disagreements to be resolved through consensus . 3 . 3 . 2 Qantitative and Programmatic Analysis . For quantitative analysis , we programmatically analyzed paper counts for the full 43 year period and developed novel visualisations to demonstrate our fndings . Following this , we performed an analysis of partici - pants counts for user studies – calculating mean , median , interquar - tile range and standard deviation providing analysis for the entire dataset and each community of focus . Then we constructed an inventory of key devices regularly mentioned within the research 13 An extension of Cohen’s Kappa for three raters or more [ 53 ] . 14 The identifcation of diferences , advantages and limitations of high - tech AAC versus wider accessibility standards we believe will improve future high - tech AAC devices and interventions . 15 The third author was new to the dataset and not involved in the code development process – resulting in a marginally lower IRR versus other papers [ 112 ] . 15 14 13 and analyzed corresponding results from the Mack et al . , SR into accessibility research [ 112 ] . However , we accept that a limitation of the comparison is that the Mack et al . , dataset is from a more recent period of 2010 - 9 . 4 RESULTS 4 . 1 A Taxonomy of High - tech AAC Devices and Interventions We present results from the following 7 categories within our dataset of 562 papers : interaction input , output modality , scalar attributes , layout , scenarios / communication partners , communica - tion model and communication type . 4 . 1 . 1 Input and Output Interaction . We successfully coded the in - puts and outputs of high - tech AAC devices within the dataset ( see Figure 4 ) . Starting with inputs , the most frequent locus of research is mechanical ( N = 216 , 38 . 4 % ) followed by tactile ( N = 184 , 32 . 7 % ) . Since the earliest high - tech AAC systems , mechanical inputs have come in a wide variety of forms . Examples include , switches [ 180 ] , keyboards [ 157 ] , button presses [ 125 ] , mechanical pointing de - vices [ 125 ] , trackballs [ 187 ] , and joysticks [ 157 ] . Tactile inputs serve as a key input modality for touchscreen controlled hard - ware e . g . , smartphones [ 124 ] , tablets [ 124 ] and smartwatches . In contrast , camera ( N = 77 , 13 . 7 % ) and gestural input ( N = 48 , 8 . 5 % ) tech - niques have been explored to a lesser extent . However , cameras have been leveraged for diferent interactions : primarily to enable eye gaze [ 17 ] , blink activated , head motion controlled high - tech AAC systems [ 17 ] , equally to better design and confgure AAC systems , to provide gesture recognition for sign language [ 70 ] and for photography to support contextual word discovery [ 91 , 141 ] , personalisation of VSDs [ 192 ] and even storytelling . Body ges - tures have been leveraged in diferent ways to control high - tech AAC devices . Systems have been designed that are controlled by tongue movement [ 143 ] , musculature contractions [ 21 ] , breath con - trolled [ 46 ] , heart rate signals and brain computer interfaces ( BCIs ) . BCIs have been developed for diferent brain signals such as EEG and EMG signals [ 86 ] . Recent advances have been made using BCI’s such as P300 - based , the RSVP Keyboard and BrainGate to enable individuals with a physical disability to use assisted communication interfaces [ 59 , 148 , 149 , 178 ] . Contextual ( N = 31 , 5 . 5 % ) , and verbal inputs ( N = 29 , 5 . 2 % ) are less explored in high - tech AAC . Contextual enables smart leveraging of environmental knowledge to act as an input to the high - tech AAC device [ 22 , 99 ] . Knowledge of the context i . e . , environment , location or communication partner have been harnessed in high - tech AAC systems for : natural language generation ( NLG ) [ 152 ] , synthesised vocabulary searches , discourse prediction , improved adaptation to topics and to capture experiences [ 90 , 91 ] . Verbal inputs can be used as another input for high - tech AAC devices – to provide utterance recognition [ 174 ] , perform NLP on the com - munication partners dialogue [ 195 ] , function as a voice input voice output device [ 72 ] and ofer prosody on the wearer’s dialect . Lastly , orientational input ( N = 7 , 1 . 2 % ) serves as an underexplored input technique . Accelerometers have been harnessed to calibrate and im - prove the conversation rate of people with motor impairments [ 66 ] , develop wearables to translate sign language in real time [ 8 ] , for ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece Curtis et al .

Unlike inputs , outputs for high - tech AAC devices have been less widely explored . Audio signals dominant communication output ( N = 353 , N = 62 . 8 % ) – high - tech AAC devices tend to serve as SGDs , VOCAs and for speech synthesis . High - tech AAC outputting visual signals for the purpose of communication have also been well explored ( N = 157 , 27 . 9 % ) – including print - able text interfaces , direct screens with captions , photographs , and graphics for the communication partner [ 40 , 150 ] . More abstract visual signal systems have been researched including LED lights and graphics [ 166 ] . Motion - based AAC is an emerging research area ( N = 11 , 2 % ) . For instance , the motion of robots to communi - cate [ 85 ] – including in LEGO adaptable forms for children [ 1 ] and co - designed novel sidekicks [ 180 ] . In addition , haptic feedback has been briefy explored for individuals with deaf - blindness [ 171 ] . Our dataset did not include AAC that uses taste or heat as a modality for communication . 4 . 1 . 2 Typical Features of High - tech AAC . In Table 2 , the feature space of high - tech AAC is rich – here we coded for scalar attributes and the interface layouts of high - tech AAC . We found that ac - cessibility researchers have prioritised developing high - tech AAC that is customisable ( N = 310 , 55 . 2 % ) and automatic ( N = 262 , 46 . 6 % ) . Customisability has been honed as a signifcant factor for making high - tech AAC more usable and personalized thereby increasing adoption and acceptance of the high - tech AAC [ 34 ] . Automation has been a well - explored and key area for high - tech AAC – automation of keystrokes [ 61 ] , predictive text , abbreviation expansion [ 158 ] and leveraging AI [ 22 ] has been researched to improve users’ com - munication rates . Following these two subcodes , high - tech AAC has been developed to be expressive ( N = 110 , 19 . 6 % ) for diferent genders [ 68 ] , cultural groups [ 82 ] , and age ranges [ 35 ] . To a lesser extent AAC has been developed to receive combinations of inputs ( N = 57 , 10 . 1 % ) to improve usability . Research has considered making high - tech AAC more practical ( N = 45 , 8 % ) – through making the State of the Art in AAC ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece Inputs Outputs Mechanical - 216 ( 38 . 4 % ) - 140 ( 24 . 9 % ) Audio - 353 ( 62 . 8 % ) - 280 ( 49 . 8 % ) Visual - 157 ( 27 . 9 % ) - 87 ( 15 . 5 % ) Motion - 11 ( 2 % ) - 4 ( 0 . 7 % ) Thermoception - 0 ( 0 % ) - 0 ( 0 % ) Gustation - 0 ( 0 % ) - 0 ( 0 % ) Tactile - 184 ( 32 . 7 % ) - 111 ( 19 . 8 % ) Camera - 77 ( 13 . 7 % ) - 34 ( 6 % ) Gestural - 48 ( 8 . 5 % ) - 28 ( 5 % ) Contextual - 31 ( 5 . 5 % ) - 5 ( 0 . 9 % ) Verbal - 29 ( 5 . 2 % ) - 8 ( 1 . 4 % ) Orientational - 7 ( 1 . 2 % ) - 3 ( 0 . 5 % ) Figure 4 : Sankey diagram proportionally representing inputs and outputs of AAC found in the review . The frst number indi - cates the frequency , the second the number or instances this code was found without other inputs / outputs .

Accessibility researchers have considered leveraging AI systems to improve the adaptiveness ( N = 42 , 7 . 5 % ) of the AAC system – to improve feature recognition i . e . , eye gaze / landmark detection , to orient to the user over time [ 6 ] and for improving frequency prediction algorithms of vocabulary dependent on location and usage history [ 62 ] . A small amount of research has considered making high - tech AAC parallel ( N = 17 , 3 % ) and morphable ( N = 14 , 2 . 5 % ) . Examples of parallel AAC includes a high - tech device that receives eye - gaze and simultaneous input suggestions from the communication partner to increase communication rates during exchanges [ 51 ] . Limited high - tech AAC is morphable thereby physically adaptive according to the consumer preferences or designed to run on diferent hardware and devices . Some examples , include do it yourself ( DIY ) AAC kits [ 71 ] , Lego robots physically confgurable by the child [ 2 ] and an AAC device that changes form factor by running on either a wrist wearable and head worn display [ 193 ] . In terms of interface , we fnd that most high - tech AAC interfaces use text ( N = 322 , 57 . 3 % ) and symbols ( N = 223 , 39 . 7 % ) . Historically , grid formats ( N = 157 , 27 . 9 % ) for AAC often with accompanying symbols have been popular [ 4 ] . To a lesser extent high - tech AAC has leveraged pictures or been drawn ( N = 127 , 22 . 6 % ) . Few papers had no or a limited interface meaning the AAC operated of sensors ( N = 29 , 5 . 2 % ) [ 151 ] . A notably small number of papers ( N = 29 , 5 . 2 % ) provided research of high - tech AAC with a visual scene display ( VSD ) . Lastly , a small selection of papers ( N = 5 , 0 . 2 % ) had entirely novel interfaces including LED morse code [ 78 ] , augmented reality [ 94 ] , and tactile surfaces [ 171 ] . 4 . 1 . 3 Communication Supported by High - tech AAC . High - tech AAC is designed for diferent scenarios and contexts of usage ( see Table 3 ) – here we code if papers explicitly mentioned contexts in which the device could be used . Signifcantly , devices have mainly ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece Curtis et al . Table 3 : Frequency of applied codes for scenarios of high - tech AAC usage mentioned within dataset . Scenario Papers w / code This code only Professionals 315 ( 56 % ) 155 ( 27 . 8 % ) Family / friends 221 ( 39 . 3 % ) 56 ( 10 % ) Strangers 65 ( 11 . 6 % ) 14 ( 2 . 5 % ) Groups 39 ( 6 . 9 % ) 1 ( 0 . 2 % ) Virtual 37 ( 6 . 6 % ) 21 ( 3 . 7 % ) Fellow AAC users 11 ( 2 % ) 1 ( 0 . 2 % ) Anyone 7 ( 1 . 2 % ) 5 ( 0 . 9 % ) Unclear 22 ( 3 . 9 % ) 22 ( 3 . 9 % ) been built for professional contexts typically with specialists , teach - ers or carers ( N = 315 , 56 % ) . Additionally , high - tech AAC has often been designed to be used with family and friends ( N = 221 , 39 . 3 % ) at home or in social settings . A smaller number of papers ( N = 65 , 11 . 6 % ) mentioned designing high - tech AAC for use with strangers or unfa - miliar communication partners . In addition , an even smaller number of papers discussed high - tech AAC to be used with groups ( N = 39 , 6 . 9 % ) and virtual communication ( N = 37 , 6 . 6 % ) . Group scenarios involve several people – making the communication environment pose potentially signifcantly more challenges for the high - tech AAC device [ 180 ] . Also high - tech AAC will need to facilitate user’s self - expression and communication in virtual environments ( N = 37 , 6 . 6 % ) – a small subset of papers has considered this for phone calls [ 50 ] , videoconferencing [ 96 ] , and online gaming [ 169 ] . Lastly , we fnd little high - tech AAC aware of supporting communication exchanges between fellow AAC users ( 2 % ) with the same or a dif - ferent high - tech AAC device – yet it is potentially common for two high - tech AAC users to directly communicate with each other regularly e . g . , within special needs schools [ 81 , 140 ] . In Table 4 , we fnd that most high - tech AAC is designed to augment and enrich verbal communication ( N = 519 , 92 . 3 % ) – high - tech AAC to just sup - port users non - verbal forms of communication is neglected in the literature ( N = 8 , 1 . 4 % ) [ 52 ] . Furthermore , we fnd limited high - tech AAC devices operating at communication rates beyond interactive . Instead , linear is by far the most common communication model ( N = 491 , 87 . 4 % ) – here using the device to provide feedback is re - strained and the AAC user must take signifcant time to construct messages [ 11 ] . Interactive high - tech AAC devices ( N = 61 , 10 . 9 % ) increase the communication rate by enabling the AAC user to ofer feedback in a restrained manner . We fnd some high - tech AAC ( N = 8 , 1 . 4 % ) could potentially ofer pathways to transactional com - munication for its user . Here , high - tech AAC leverages snippets of discourse utilising advanced technologies to take in contextual information [ 63 , 195 ] signifcantly diminishing the reciprocity gap between communicators [ 27 ] . 4 . 2 The Incumbent Methodologies Used to Design and Study High - tech AAC 4 . 2 . 1 High - tech AAC Contribution Counts and Types . Depicted in Figure 5 , paper counts for high - tech AAC has grown steadily over the period of 1978 - 2021 yet this growth surges with counts over 25 for each year since 2011 . This replicates wider trends noting the in - creasing prominence of accessibility research [ 112 ] . Notable market available hardware innovations have also fed this growth . High - tech AAC devices have become more readily available with designers able to shift from dedicated hardware e . g . , Dynavox DynaMyte 3100 ( 1999 ) to increasingly developing apps e . g . , Proloquo2Go ( 2009 ) for accessible touch - screen devices such as smartphones e . g . , iPhone ( 2007 ) and smart - tablets e . g . , iPad ( 2010 ) . Further analysing the input / output data over time in Table 5 , we fnd trends have to a greater extent reciprocated evolution’s in the market available hard - ware and a general increase over time 16 . Predictably , in terms of inputs camera ( 0 % to 22 . 4 % ) and tactile touchscreen technology has increased with time ( 0 % to 43 . 3 % ) . Whilst , mechanical inputs have steadily fallen over time ( 100 % to 22 . 4 % ) . In Table 6 , we found the majority of high - tech AAC con - tributions were empirical ( N = 410 , 73 % ) and artifact ( N = 224 , 39 . 9 % ) contributions . The two contributions regularly occurred in conjunc - tion ( N = 169 , N = 30 . 1 % ) . Similarly , in the Mack et al . dataset these were both the two most popular contribution types [ 112 ] . Equally , the following four contribution types occurred comparatively less with Survey ( N = 60 , 10 . 7 % ) , methodological ( N = 43 , 7 . 7 % ) , theoreti - cal and opinion ( N = 19 , 3 . 4 % ) and Dataset ( N = 6 , 1 . 1 % ) . However , a notable diference with the Mack et al . , was that literature survey contributions were much higher for high - tech AAC ( + 10 . 1 % ) and typically published within the AAC journal ( N = 31 / 60 , 51 . 6 % ) – lit - erature surveys are a regular practice to provide essential refection on current medical practices [ 155 ] . 4 . 2 . 2 Location of User Studies . Incorporating locations beyond the lab may enable accessibility researchers to have more users and test if high - tech AAC functions in settings where it will be used day - to - day . Our results noted in Table 7 , quite closely replicate trends found in the Mack et al . , research [ 112 ] . A substantial proportion of studies take place at home , residence or school ( N = 181 , 43 . 6 % ) and near or in the researchers laboratory ( N = 178 , 42 . 8 % ) . High - tech AAC researchers have been successful at recruiting participants for studies that take place at home or schools – a place where par - ticipants are comfortable and visit frequently [ 55 ] . Furthermore , user studies in these locations may broaden participation amongst vulnerable groups e . g . , testing high - tech AAC with children [ 55 ] . Lab studies are almost as popular , enabling the research team to carefully control the variables and environment for testing – sup - porting the collection of observation data [ 173 ] . Neutral locations ( N = 71 , 17 . 1 % ) feature relatively prominently and are diverse such as : day programs [ 39 ] , intervention camps [ 32 ] , clinics , medical centres [ 163 ] , fast food restaurants [ 44 ] , extracurricular clubs and community centres [ 191 ] . Some of these locations have the ad - vantage of testing the high - tech AAC in live , realistic and natural conditions that are hard to replicate within a lab . Often neutral locations are selected by the participants themselves due to per - sonal preference [ 118 ] . Furthermore , these settings may imbue the user with confdence that the AAC can be used in a public location . Online and remote participation ( N = 50 , 17 . 1 % ) has been used to 16 We also note that this review was done approximately 1 / 5 the way through the 2020s , so accounts for a smaller number of papers . Extrapolating the number ( i . e . multiplying the number of papers in the 2020s by 5 ) , we get 335 papers – suggesting a continuing increase in the number of papers on AAC .

Refecting on the user - centred na - ture of high - tech AAC , overwhelmingly user studies are favoured ( N = 415 , 73 . 8 % ) – despite the potential difculties of obtaining partic - ipants with CCNs who often cannot easily provide verbal consent . In contrast , studies which do not incorporate user studies ( N = 147 , 26 . 2 % ) involve artifacts with no user testing ( N = 57 , 10 . 1 % ) survey ( N = 53 , 9 . 4 % ) , methodological ( N = 25 , 4 . 4 % ) , theoretical ( N = 15 , 2 . 7 % ) , empirical ( N = 7 , 1 . 2 % ) and dataset ( N = 4 , 0 . 7 % ) contributions . These studies without formal user testing – typically involve prototype development [ 177 ] , exploratory studies [ 108 ] and analyses of user - studies conducted in other research [ 154 ] . Noted in Table 8 , the dominant preference for studying high - tech AAC is controlled experiments ( N = 188 , 45 . 3 % ) and usability testing ( N = 119 , 28 . 7 % ) . In - terviews ( N = 67 , 16 . 1 % ) rank to a lesser extent and typically involves interviewing speech and language therapists ( SLTs ) and family members due to the challenges of directly interviewing someone with CCNs [ 132 ] . Field studies ( N = 75 , 18 . 1 % ) and case studies ( N = 48 , 11 . 6 % ) also rank quite highly – researchers often try to learn of the success of deployment by observing in naturalistic settings high - tech AAC usage [ 67 ] . Lastly , we found no contributions using ran - domized control trials ( N = 0 , 0 % ) ( RCTs ) . Surveys and questionnaires ( N = 65 , 15 . 7 % ) have been regularly deployed to assess over large groups of users and gain an understanding of potential patterns and commonalities [ 168 ] . Furthermore , surveys enable high - tech AAC users to communicate at there preferred rates without feel - ing pressure to provide feedback quickly [ 133 ] and AAC is a well established community with foundations / charities with extensive mailing lists [ 47 , 121 , 183 ] . Focus groups ( N = 21 , 5 . 1 % ) and work - shops ( N = 4 , 1 % ) feature quite lowly – due to the complexities of gaining feedback from users with communication barriers [ 16 , 90 ] . Comparing to the broader Mack et al . dataset [ 112 ] , high - tech AAC research comparatively favours more case studies ( + 7 . 6 % ) and con - trolled experiments ( + 10 . 7 % ) at the expense of interviews ( - 26 % ) , workshops ( - 17 . 4 % ) and usability testing ( - 13 % ) . 4 . 2 . 4 Participatory Methods . Participatory design ( PD ) provides a method for involving users of technology direct in its design [ 57 , ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece Curtis et al . Table 5 : Incremental 10 year binning of frequency of applied codes for input / output data of AAC over time . Percentage calcu - lation involves dividing number of papers with code by paper count within period . Data is weighted towards AAC from the 2000s and 2010s , with a steady year - on - year increase over time . We see a gradual difusion in output types , away from only mechanical to a more equal split of form factors . We see audio and visual dominating as outputs consistently over time .

However , PD methods have not been widely adopted in high - tech AAC user - study papers ( N = 20 , 4 . 8 % ) – lower than the Mack et al . dataset ( - 5 . 5 % ) . Indeed , for users with CCNs – traditional PD methods are more inaccessible compared to other communities and groups [ 28 , 136 ] . PD is cognitively demanding and requires for people with CCNs to have high levels of speech and language profciency [ 136 , 194 ] . Prior research has outlined challenges in engaging populations with autism [ 57 ] , aphasia [ 28 , 90 ] , Parkin - son’s / dementia [ 26 ] and IDD [ 136 ] in PD . Researchers have de - veloped solutions to mitigate against this through proxies [ 28 ] – e . g using SLTs for the PD of high - tech AAC . Other studies that did not use co - design engaged in other rich design activities such as user - centred design [ 186 ] , intervention programs [ 187 ] , use of probes [ 129 ] and academic workshops [ 195 ] . 4 . 2 . 5 Category of Devices . Figure 6 , shows that research has regu - larly provided interventions using expensive standalone commer - cial high - tech AAC devices including DynaVox models ( N = 63 ) e . g . , the Dynavox 3100 ( N = 9 ) and their eyetracking technologies the To - bii models e . g . , Tobii T60 ( N = 5 ) , Tobii X120 ( N = 1 ) . Other standalone high - tech AAC devices used in research includes the Lightwriter ( N = 14 ) , Pathfnder ( N = 14 ) and Liberator ( N = 13 ) .

Elsewhere , we fnd a slight preference towards testing with commercial ( N = 227 , 54 . 7 % ) versus non - commercial ( N = 188 , 45 . 3 % ) high - tech AAC within user - study papers . Indeed , for SLTs and non - computer science research groups it is often easier to program and customise pre - existing available commercial high - tech AAC devices than develop new non - commercial high - tech AAC . Other advantage of commercial high - tech AAC is that they are a more reliable intervention as the device is maintained by an external cor - poration [ 4 ] . Non - commercial oferings involve the research team actively building and developing new high - tech AAC solutions for the end users within the study . Advantages of the non - commercial solutions is that the high - tech AAC is often free to its user , and does not involve external purchase , subscription and maintenance fees [ 186 ] . 4 . 3 Communities of Focus and Participants for High - tech AAC Research 4 . 3 . 1 The Communities of Focus . Shown in Table 9 , high - tech AAC research has largely focused on users categorised as Other ( N = 219 , 39 % ) and motor impairments ( N = 182 , N = 32 . 4 % ) .

Motor impairments have also received a signifcant research contribu - tion ( N = 182 , 32 . 4 % ) . In particular , disabilities such as cerebral palsy ( N = 107 , 19 . 1 % ) and ALS ( N = 20 , 3 . 6 % ) have been a specifc focus for the motor - impairment high - tech AAC research . Groups that have received less research include cognitive impairments ( N = 74 , 13 . 2 % ) , autism ( N = 71 , 12 . 6 % ) and IDD ( N = 67 , 11 . 9 % ) . Within other cognitive impairments , the dominant contribution has been towards people living with aphasia ( N = 47 , 8 . 4 % ) and people with TBIs ( N = 10 , 1 . 8 % ) . Many of the autism and IDD contributions have built high - tech AAC with child and adolescent users e . g . , [ 55 ] . Groups with little research include BVI ( N = 11 , 2 % ) , DHH ( N = 14 , 2 . 5 % ) , Older adults ( N = 4 , 0 . 7 % ) and General disabilities ( N = 3 , 0 . 5 % ) – these are not mainstream users of high - tech AAC with CCNs . Our data versus the Mack et al . dataset for accessibility research reveals some difer - ences [ 112 ] . In broader accessibility research BVI is the dominant focus ( - 41 . 5 % ) , whilst in high - tech AAC it is Other ( + 29 . 9 % ) and motor impairments ( + 18 . 2 % ) . Also , Autism ( + 6 . 5 % ) , IDD ( + 9 . 1 % ) and Other cognitive impairments ( + 4 . 1 % ) received a slightly higher pro - portion of contributions within our dataset . However , DHH ( - 8 . 8 % ) , Older adults ( - 8 . 2 % ) and General disability ( - 8 . 6 % ) received a slightly lower contribution within our dataset . 4 . 3 . 2 Study Participants . Table 10 shows the participant data for user studies . The majority of studies include people with disabili - ties ( N = 305 , 73 . 5 % ) albeit in these studies the median participant counts are predominantly low ( N = 5 ) and imbalanced with a high standard deviation ( SD ) and range . Equally , fewer papers include people with just disabilities only ( N = 178 , 42 . 9 % ) . A proportion of the papers include caregivers ( N = 75 , 18 . 1 % ) and specialists ( N = 62 , 14 . 9 % ) particularly often to complement other users involved in the user - study 18 . A sizeable proportion of the user studies include people without disabilities ( N = 130 , 31 . 3 % ) with even N = 82 papers ( 19 . 8 % ) only with people without disabilities . For studies including people without disabilities we fnd participant counts are much higher with a median of N = 18 . Due to the difculties designing for users with CCNs – proxies are often favoured [ 28 ] . Indeed , it 17 E . g . , The high - tech AAC requirements of a user living with aphasia is very diferent to a user living with cerebral palsy . 18 Indeed , only N = 15 papers are coded with just specialists and N = 6 coded with just caregivers . is even quite common for papers to test with proxies to gain ini - tial data on high - tech AAC before considering a disabled group of users [ 28 ] . Albeit , sometimes it makes legitimate sense to use participants without disabilities because the research is examining perspectives on high - tech AAC – monitoring its social acceptance amongst peers e . g . , [ 101 ] . A signifcant proportion of high - tech AAC user - study papers include specialists ( 14 . 9 % ) and caregivers ( 18 . 1 % ) . Additionally , in these studies , the median participant count positively increases for specialists ( N = 9 . 5 ) and caregivers ( N = 8 . 5 ) . Indeed , this is to be expected as people with CCNs in user - studies sometimes re - quire caregivers and specialists to assist with communicating and expressing themselves [ 136 ] . Equally , these groups can provide key insights and feedback on the high - tech AAC within the user - study [ 28 ] . Comparing these fndings versus the wider Mack et al . research we fnd a lower number of user studies coded with people with disabilities ( - 11 . 2 % ) and higher number of user stud - ies using people without disabilities ( + 8 . 2 % ) . In addition , we fnd a marginally lower number of papers with specialists ( - 2 . 1 % ) but much higher usage of caregivers ( + 8 . 7 % ) . In terms of community of focus , participant counts are median highest for the non - specifc category of Other ( N = 16 ) . However , median participant counts are lower for Motor impairments ( N = 6 ) and Other cognitive ( N = 6 ) , yet participant counts are very low for high - tech AAC user - study papers involving people with IDD ( N = 5 ) and Autism ( N = 4 ) 19 . Over - all , the low median participant counts , high ranges and standard deviations refect the methods favoured in high - tech AAC research – very large surveys versus interventions with just one or a small group of users . 4 . 3 . 3 Usage of Proxies and Ability - based Comparisons . From our 415 user - study papers , we identifed 86 papers where proxies were used ( N = 86 , 20 . 7 % ) – higher than the Mack et al . dataset ( + 12 . 7 % ) . To a certain degree , this trend was expected as proxies are often used to circumvent communication barriers [ 28 ] . However many of the proxy papers ( 34 . 9 % , N = 30 / 86 ) were for motor impairments , which compromises the validity of fndings as it is difcult for a proxy user to accurately replicate the role of a motor impaired user [ 113 ] . Sometimes a member of the research team has acted as a proxy high - tech AAC user to obtain social perspectives from 19 Typically , these studies can often include vulnerable children users of high - tech AAC resulting in a lower - participant count State of the Art in AAC ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece Table 10 : Frequency of applied codes for study participants within 415 user study papers versus Mack et al . accessibility data [ 112 ] .

We identifed just 25 cases of ability based comparisons ( N = 25 , 6 % ) in which disabled and non - disabled participants were compared in the user - study papers – sometimes this is to have able participants act as the control group for deter - mining if the high - tech AAC SGD ofers the same intelligibility as natural human vocals [ 127 ] and whether the communication rate is equivalent [ 88 ] . Additionally , testing has been performed in dyads to determine cross - task performance [ 159 ] . Comparing to the Mack et al . , ability based comparisons are used less frequently ( - 7 . 6 % ) within our dataset [ 112 ] . 5 DISCUSSION Despite four decades of research , abandonment of high - tech AAC devices and interventions continues [ 140 , 185 ] . Therefore , this frst SR and taxonomy of ACM high - tech AAC research serves as a refection for more successful future high - tech AAC development and intervention outcomes . Based on our taxonomy and results , we formulate directions for further research in high - tech AAC and interventions in light of our three research questions : 1 . 2 to 1 . 2 . 5 . 1 Expanding the Characteristics of High - tech AAC Devices and Interventions Our frst research question – presents what is the pre - existing taxonomy and dominant characteristics of high - tech AAC . From our examination and codifcation of the literature we fnd that me - chanical ( 38 . 4 % ) was the dominant input modality for standalone high - tech AAC devices before a surge in tactile ( 32 . 7 % ) inputs with the decentralisation of high - tech AAC through capacitive touch - screens ( e . g . , smartphones , tablets ) and easily downloadable apps ( e . g . through app stores ) . However , audio ( 62 . 8 % ) and visual ( 27 . 9 % ) have remained the most well explored output modalities . In re - sponse to these fndings , high - tech AAC designers should more systematically explore the input / output interaction possibilities of using high - tech AAC . For example , with regards to inputs : camera , gestural , verbal and contextual inputs serve as a still largely un - explored input modalities ( 5 . 2 % to 13 . 7 % ) , which we believe hold much promise for future high - tech AAC . For instance , Fiannaca et al . , increased gaze - based and eye - tracking communication rates leveraging contextual inputs with the AACrobat [ 51 ] . Additionally , Wisenburn et al . , used verbal inputs from partner speech recog - nition providing contextually relevant utterances and increased communication rates [ 195 ] . Lastly , with regards to gestural inter - action Ascari et al . , explored non - invasive personalised gestural interaction for the purposes of communication [ 7 ] whilst BCI - AAC remains an emerging research area , which enables practitioners to entirely bypass users motor system – albeit the successful deploy - ment and calibration of BCIs is currently challenging [ 119 , 148 , 149 ] . High - tech AAC devices that have leveraged novel input charac - teristics have ofered promising results for their user groups , for instance using camera input for eye - tracking [ 97 ] , storytelling [ 3 ] and understanding the environment [ 141 ] . Harnessing pre - existing ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece Curtis et al . interdisciplinary AI research such as natural language process - ing ( NLP ) [ 73 ] or smart environments [ 23 , 36 , 64 ] , might support the development of contextual and verbal inputs for high - tech AAC to improve communication rates , enable easier interactions , more agency and autonomy . Complementary research on outputs , fnds that high - tech AAC typically outputs audio ( 62 . 8 % ) and visual ( 27 . 9 % ) channels to communicate – future work might explore the feasibility of the motion ( 2 % ) and even thermoception ( 0 % ) as out - puts . Indeed , these more subtle and less information dense channels can still be leveraged to support communication and engaging hu - man to human interaction , particularly non - verbal communication ( c . f . “sidekicks " [ 179 ] and physical expressive objects [ 180 ] ) . With respect to common scalar attributes and interface layouts of high - tech AAC , we fnd that AAC is often customisable ( 55 . 2 % ) and ofers automation ( 46 . 6 % ) typically for prediction to foster increased communication rates [ 74 ] . Whilst high - tech AAC layouts often use text ( 57 . 3 % ) , symbols ( 39 . 7 % ) , grids ( 27 . 9 % ) and pictures ( 22 . 6 % ) – for instance the DynaVox 3100 serves as a typical grid , symbol and text based interface [ 4 ] . To better expand these characteristics , future AAC that just ofers customisation and automation is likely not enough . Indeed , too often using high - tech AAC does not feel natural but restrained for the end user’s autonomy resulting in abandonment [ 81 , 140 ] – the voice of the device does not refect their personhood [ 117 ] , the device is impractical to carry around day - to - day [ 11 ] , indiscreet limiting social acceptance [ 145 ] , difcult to use with few modes of input [ 20 ] and not adaptive to the constantly evolving communication abilities of the user [ 20 , 80 ] . Additionally , future AAC research could explore more VSDs , video and animation – these are under researched interfaces with the ability to convey meaning [ 83 ] . Importantly , high - tech AAC designers must be aware that text - based interfaces are challenging for some groups – e . g . , people with aphasia [ 189 ] . Turning to scenarios of usage , communication types and mod - els – we fnd that high - tech AAC devices are typically designed to be used with professionals ( 56 % ) and families / friends ( 39 . 3 % ) sup - porting verbal communication ( 92 . 3 % ) . However , high - tech AAC designers must be aware that users with CCNs often have larger social groups than anticipated [ 180 ] , users also require the ability to use their high - tech AAC to communicate virtually ( 6 . 6 % ) on social media [ 34 , 123 ] or as widely appreciated during the pandemic , on videoconferencing software [ 96 , 137 , 180 ] . Little high - tech AAC is designed to function in group settings ( 6 . 9 % ) , particularly if the communication partner is a fellow AAC user ( 2 % ) with the same or a similar high - tech AAC device – research has shown that in this case breakdowns are common unless both users have analogous vocabulary libraries pre - installed prior to the exchange [ 20 , 81 ] . In addition , there has been an under representation of high - tech AAC that empowers the users non - verbal communication ( 1 . 4 % ) – this compounds into most high - tech AAC ofering linear communica - tion interactions ( 87 . 4 % ) [ 180 ] . Indeed , high - tech AAC must show an appreciation of the users pre - existing communication abilities to increase communication rates beyond linear – encouraging em - bodied forms of communication and re - framing high - tech AAC as an accepted interdependent assistive technology [ 15 , 81 ] . Too often , high - tech AAC restrains communication by acting as a physical independent barrier – restraining the user from freely employing there own unique communication skills including non - verbal sig - nals to provide feedback more quickly [ 15 , 52 , 81 ] . 5 . 2 Reassessment of Incumbent Research Contributions and Methodologies in High - tech AAC Research and Interventions The second research question of this paper focused on what meth - ods are used to contribute towards high - tech AAC research and interventions . Versus other contributions , dataset contributions ( 1 . 1 % ) are comparatively under - explored , thus high - tech AAC re - search could certainly have more contributions focused on AI and ML datasets . As proposed by Mack et al . and Kane et al . , looking to the future , AI and ML datasets should certainly be rooted in ac - cessibility research [ 112 ] and equally have the potential to greatly enrich the efectiveness of high - tech AAC research and interven - tions [ 92 , 140 ] . Already , work at ASSETS’21 by Theodorou et al . [ 172 ] explores the concept of a “Disability - First” dataset , which supports an accessible method for visually impaired users to create their own datasets for personal object recognition . Furthermore , as rightly noted by Park et al . , there is a defnitive lack of data from disabled populations and consequently they have provided a robust set of design guidelines for developers looking to gather data from disabled populations [ 147 ] . Indeed , the properly considered deployment of AI within high - tech AAC might support quicker , empathetic and more seamless communication opportunities for people living with CCNs [ 140 ] . For instance , Vertanen et al . , suc - cessfully deployed crowd - sourced data - sets to ofer improved word prediction and better high - tech AAC communication rates – yet critically , the underlying data did not originate specifcally from AAC users and disabled communities [ 184 ] . User - study papers ( 73 % ) compromise a sizable proportion of our dataset and we believe this must continue and even increase for suc - cessful high - tech AAC outcomes [ 140 ] . The location of user studies is signifcant for high - tech AAC – researchers have successfully tested widely in : residences ( 43 . 6 % ) , labs ( 42 . 8 % ) , neutral ( 17 . 1 % ) and even remote ( 12 % ) locations . Nonetheless , researchers must look to test high - tech AAC performance in the very conditions where it will be deployed . Key reasons preventing high - tech AAC adoption , include that the devices promise an unrealistic “magic wand” [ 20 ] , failing to adapt to the contextual environmental challenges ( e . g . , noisy environments ) [ 96 , 117 ] or consider peer perceptions of the high - tech AAC device [ 5 ] – the potential accompanying stigmas and its efect in conversational power dynamics [ 15 , 101 ] . Indeed , the high - tech AAC device should be shaped by its user and context of usage [ 20 ] – high - tech AAC performance cannot be assumed on the basis of unnatural controlled conditions rather than the actual con - texts of daily usage [ 140 ] . With regards to high - tech AAC research methods , we found no cases of randomized control trials ( RCTs ) ( N = 0 , 0 % ) within our dataset . Indeed in 2018 , Kent - Walsh et al . report that no RCTs have been published in the AAC journal [ 93 ] . How - ever , further searching outside of the realm of this SR within the medical literature 20 we do fnd some RCTs with AAC e . g . , [ 79 , 134 ] . Furthermore , Todman et al . have strongly advocated for their usage 20 Beyond the scope of our investigation , RCTs with AAC were found via medical literature databases i . e . , https : / / pubmed . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / and Google Scholar . State of the Art in AAC ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece as AAC devices are categorised as medical equipment requiring ran - dom assignment procedures for treatment efcacy [ 175 ] . Therefore , we suggest further RCTs to mitigate against bias and the ensure clinical efcacy of high - tech AAC interventions [ 176 ] . Elsewhere , usability testing ( 28 . 7 % ) , interviews ( 16 . 1 % ) , work - shops ( 1 % ) and PD methods ( 4 . 8 % ) all rank lower than the Mack et al . dataset for the general accessibility community . Consequently , we fnd a smaller use of methods in which AAC users with CCNs are directly engaged and the development process is cooperative e . g . , [ 23 , 90 ] . We accept that it is difcult to recruit , engage in interviews , participatory design , usability testing [ 16 ] and work - shops [ 57 ] with users that have severe CCNs , struggle to communi - cate independently [ 90 ] and provide consent [ 28 , 136 ] . Nonetheless , we echo Mankof et al . [ 114 ] – we must , as a community , actively strive to include end users within the design and development pro - cess of AAC . Researchers have , in summary , not received enough feedback 21 from empowered end users during the development pro - cess . Future research should build upon prior PD which has focused on motor - impairments [ 41 ] , autism [ 57 , 167 ] , dementia [ 109 ] , apha - sia [ 60 , 138 , 194 ] and older individuals [ 110 ] . Further participatory designed high - tech AAC solutions for people with CCNs could re - sult in better outcomes and more long - term adoption [ 136 ] . Indeed , examples of PD found within our high - tech AAC dataset include Kane et al . ’s TalkAbout - a context - aware , adaptive AAC system co - designed in collaboration with 5 adults with aphasia [ 90 ] and de Faria Borges et al . ’s PD4CAT customized communication device developed in collaboration with a child with cerebral palsy [ 41 ] . 5 . 3 Engaging with Communities and Greater Representation in High - tech AAC Research and Interventions For the third research question and understanding who does high - tech AAC research focus upon , we get very diferent results from the Mack et al . research . In contrast , within our dataset Other ( 39 % ) and Motor impairments ( 32 . 4 % ) feature prominently versus the Mack et al . yet comparatively BVI takes up a much smaller minority of re - search ( - 41 . 1 % ) . Directly commenting on these results , pre - existing high - tech AAC research has perhaps lacked specifcity regarding its targeted community of focus as the majority of contributions within our dataset is towards Other [ 112 ] . Investigating further , we fnd that the Other community of focus frequently in papers is rep - resented as diluted communities such as “AAC users " e . g . , [ 56 ] or “Children " e . g . , [ 144 ] . This lack of specifcity has perhaps resulted in high - tech AAC that lacks focus or curated design for specifc target groups , disabilities , communities and their unique set of needs [ 112 ] . Therefore , a clear direction for research is that we implore future high - tech AAC development to be directly contributing towards a specifc community of focus with CCNs . Elsewhere , we fnd that Other cognitive ( 13 . 2 % ) , ASD ( 12 . 6 % ) and IDD ( 11 . 9 % ) could re - ceive more high - tech AAC contributions and are under represented versus Motor impairments ( 32 . 4 % ) – indeed Other cognitive [ 146 ] , Autism [ 37 ] and IDD [ 115 ] are prominent communities within so - ciety . Lastly , Older adults have a very small contribution ( 0 . 7 % ) – 21 Bircanin et al . , have even suggested the formation of AAC publics to promote greater discourse on high - tech AAC to ensure more empowering high - tech AAC solutions are innovated [ 20 ] . nonetheless high - tech AAC could feasibly contribute towards peo - ple living with dementia and other CCNs that will become more prominent from an ageing global population [ 116 ] . With regards to participant groups , people with disabilities fea - ture most prominently ( 73 . 5 % ) , followed by people without disabili - ties ( 31 . 3 % ) . Although our high - tech AAC dataset has less people with disabilities ( - 11 . 2 % ) and more people without ( + 8 . 2 % ) versus the Mack et al . – we believe that this is because our dataset oc - curs over a broader period ( 1978 - 2021 ) meaning that this change is perhaps symptomatic of evolving standards of practice for ac - cessibility research in particular a focus on increased engagement with participants with disabilities as a consequence of the social model of disability [ 45 ] . Therefore , we echo Mack et al . ’s encourage - ment of more direct engagement with people with disabilities [ 112 ] . Furthermore , high - tech AAC research has shown a propensity to engage with caregivers ( 18 . 1 % ) , specialists ( 14 . 9 % ) and peers – in the right circumstances this should be encouraged . Indeed , care - givers , specialists ( i . e . , SLTs ) and peers can often work as good communication partners in user studies with people with CCNs – supporting the high - tech AAC users’ expression when engaging with the study [ 29 ] or for dyads [ 103 ] . Equally , if the study involves children , parents or guardians they can also help support the child with CCNs refection and potentially provide feedback on the un - derlying efectiveness of the intervention [ 43 ] . Indeed , Delarosa et al . , rightly note that the successful integration of a high - tech AAC system requires strong commitment from parents and other family members [ 43 ] . Non - disabled participants are regularly used within our dataset ( 31 . 3 % ) , typically for either proxy usage ( 20 . 7 % ) or ability - based comparisons ( 6 % ) . Despite difculties designing and recruiting par - ticipants with CCNs [ 160 ] , we advocate not using just proxies as Mack et al . , note these high - tech AAC user studies run the risk of reinforcing normalist beliefs [ 112 ] . Furthermore , proxy users can often not accurately replicate a disabled user for testing the usability of a high - tech AAC device – particularly for users with motor - impairments [ 113 ] . Instead , proxies can be used jointly to perform initial testing [ 28 ] , triangulate fndings [ 58 ] and perhaps learn of the diferences in social perceptions versus a disabled user with high - tech AAC [ 13 ] . Although ill - frequent within our dataset , ability - based comparisons are an imperfect heuristic for determin - ing the performance of a high - tech AAC device – other qualitative fndings concerning preference and satisfaction from disabled high - tech AAC users are more useful for determining if an intervention is successful [ 11 , 87 ] . Indeed , even if the high - tech AAC success - fully ofers pathways for communication that is not defnitively a pre - requisite for long - term adoption [ 20 ] . 6 LIMITATIONS As in all SRs , we had to limit its scope . Despite a robust PRISMA guided methodology , with snowballing , our approach would have not covered all AAC papers . Indeed we only used two scientifc databases : the ACM DL and Scopus for constructing our SR dataset - there are other sources ( e . g . , IEEE , Elsevier , Thompson Reuters etc . ) which will likely reveal more papers on the topic of high - tech AAC . Additionally , for manual coding of such a large dataset there are consequently areas of potential inconsistency , subjectivity ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece Curtis et al . and errors . Consequently , some researchers have argued in favour of using quantitative and automated analyses to mitigate against this concern [ 49 , 69 , 102 , 104 ] . Our comparison of fndings with the Mack et al . [ 112 ] dataset has limitations – we are a diferent research team and therefore have introduced subjective biases into our review and our dataset covers a wider breadth of literature . Indeed , future systematic reviews of AAC could look to be more focused – for instance , explicitly focus on commercial devices or AAC developed within a smaller period of inclusion . Much like other research [ 31 , 112 ] , we also encountered highly varied language use across papers , which impacted our classifcation of codes . 7 CONCLUSION AAC is an essential support for many , yet is under - adopted and frequently abandoned . To provide deeper insight and directions for future research , we provide a taxonomic overview of the cur - rent state of high - tech AAC devices , the methodologies , contribu - tions and communities of focus – compiling a paper count and inventory of the key devices used . Our results suggest three future research directions . Firstly , more research is needed to explore high - tech AAC inputs / outputs , the role of high - tech AAC in supporting non - verbal communication , high - tech AAC communication with groups , fellow AAC users and virtual scenarios . Secondly , in terms of specifcally methods , future high - tech AAC research could use PD methods and RCTs . Thirdly and lastly , with respect to commu - nities of focus limited high - tech AAC research focuses on Other Cognitive , Autism and IDD with low median participant counts for studies incorporating people with disabilities ( N = 5 ) . We hope that our contribution will foster new and more optimally directed AAC research , towards promulgating greater adoption and more successful long - term intervention outcomes .
