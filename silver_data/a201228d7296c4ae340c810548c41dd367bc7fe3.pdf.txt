Introduction Corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) has not only garnered academic discussion but also attracted the attention of enterprises and society . The World Business Council for Sustainability and Development deﬁnes CSR as the continuing commitment by a business to contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce and their families as well as of the community and society at large . Accordingly , the goal of an enterprise during operation is to not only maximize its shareholders’ interests but also to show concern for stakeholders , socially disadvantaged groups , and environmental protection . Moreover , CSR has become a goal pursued by enterprises , because its implementation can improve corporate images and beneﬁt long - term corporate development . To survive global competition , enterprises should promote their image and develop relationships with local communities through CSR . Generally , CSR is regarded as a public service ( e . g . , philanthropy and charitable activities ) undertaken by enterprises ; however , this perspective is exceedingly narrow . In addition to charitable activities , enterprises bear not only economic and legal obligations but also other responsibilities to the society , according to the concept of CSR . Aupperle et al . [ 1 ] argue that CSR refers to a society’s expectations in terms of the economy , law , ethics , and initiative of an organization during a speciﬁc timeframe . Wood [ 2 ] deﬁnes CSR as the conﬁguration of related principles or any CSR - related strategies and plans adopted during social responsiveness . According to Dell et al . [ 3 ] , CSR denotes obligations that a ﬁrm must fulﬁll to protect and enhance the society it is in . In terms of CSR , ﬁrms should account not only for their shareholders but also all levels of stakeholders including employees , customers , upstream and downstream ﬁrms , communities , and the environment . In the past two decades , CSR has been increasingly emphasized by government agencies , businesses , and the public . The rise of environmental awareness has also prompted investors Sustainability 2018 , 10 , 3532 ; doi : 10 . 3390 / su10103532 www . mdpi . com / journal / sustainability Sustainability 2018 , 10 , 3532 2 of 14 to approve of environment - related CSR activities taken by businesses . Previous studies on the correlation between CSR and corporations’ ﬁnancial performance have mainly investigated whether corporate investment on CSR can enhance or create corporate value and effectively improve corporate performance . CSR implementation could increase brand awareness and corporate reputation , thus beneﬁting long - term corporate development . Nevertheless , CSR expenditures cannot be ignored . The relationship between CSR and corporate performance has been widely investigated . Studies including those of McWilliams and Siegel [ 4 ] and Krüger [ 5 ] consider that the results of CSR investments are inconsistent . This inconsistency shows that the performance of CSR investments is complicated and uncertain . Although implementing CSR has a positive impact and is a current trend , CSR investors could suffer a great loss . A real options approach is suitable to value the uncertainty of CSR investments . Especially , the optimal timing to invest in CSR can be derived from the real options approach , and that can help the ﬁrms to make the best decisions relating to CSR . A real options approach is therefore a great method when facing the problem of uncertainty . Scholars have widely adopted real options theory to evaluate investment projects in recent years because ﬂexibility in investment decision - making is valuable under market uncertainties [ 6 ] . However , only a few studies use the real options viewpoint to analyze CSR investments [ 7 – 10 ] . These researchers use the real options framework to study CSR investments , but they do not construct a pricing model for investigating CSR investments . According to a review of the literature , this study is the ﬁrst to derive the closed - form solution of optimal threshold of CSR investments . The main purpose of this study is to construct a dynamic CSR valuation model . This study elucidates the value of CSR and the decision to invest in CSR . Speciﬁcally , the value of CSR options facilitates determining whether to invest in CSR , and the optimal threshold for implementing CSR indicates when to invest in CSR . This study assumes that sales proﬁts follow a stochastic process and that company value varies with sales proﬁts . Moreover , the real options approach is applied to derive the company valuation of the CSR investments and determine the threshold for implementing CSR . In addition , numerical analyses and results are presented to verify the established model . Compared to the related literature , this paper contributes to the literature in several ways . First , this paper constructs a dynamic model in an uncertain environment to explain companies’ behavior regarding CSR investments . This model , being different from the standard Black – Scholes formula , offers more ﬂexibility to verify a company’s strategy . In this paper , a real options approach is applied to derive the closed - form solution of CSR investments , CSR options value , and the threshold for implementing CSR . The optimal timing to invest CSR can be an answer to the inconsistent problem regarding CSR performance . In addition , the ﬁndings of the numerical analysis verify that an industry boom with rising product prices is conducive to companies’ investments in CSR . When the investment threshold is higher , the options value approximates 0 regardless of CSR costs . The rest of this paper is organized as follows : Section 2 presents a literature review that summarizes relevant research on CSR and real options and provides a base for the subject of the current study . In Section 3 , this paper applies a real options approach to construct a CSR valuation model . Section 4 . 1 focuses on the timing to invest in CSR . Section 4 . 2 provides numerical analyses and their results , verifying the established model . Finally , Section 5 presents the conclusions . 2 . Literature Review 2 . 1 . CSR and Its Performance With the increasing importance of CSR in businesses , the literature on CSR is also growing . Numerous studies have examined the motives for and determinants of CSR , as well as the economic consequences of CSR [ 11 ] . An increasing number of studies investigate beyond the link between CSR and ﬁnancial performance [ 12 – 14 ] and examine the effect of CSR on other dimensions of ﬁrm actions and outcomes such as ﬁrm risk [ 15 ] , cost of capital [ 16 , 17 ] , and ﬁnancial reporting [ 18 – 21 ] . Sustainability 2018 , 10 , 3532 3 of 14 Existing models of CSR behavior primarily belong to two categories [ 22 ] . The ﬁrst involves models in which CSR expenditures improve operating income , and the second category comprises CSR models that assume that CSR expenditures are made because the corporate decision - makers or other nonshareholders or stakeholders feel positive at having supported their community with CSR spending , even when this has no beneﬁt for operating income . Barnea et al . [ 22 ] determine that some investors gain utility from owning companies that are active in CSR . They demonstrate that the investors’ portfolio choices affect stock prices such that value - maximizing managers make CSR expenditures . More recent research has investigated how CSR beneﬁts ﬁrms to explain CSR within the benchmark model of the ﬁrm as a proﬁt - maximizing entity . In this regard , resources allocated by ﬁrms to environmentally benign conduct , enlightened employment policies , charitable giving , and other socially worthy activities constitute investments in relationships with key stakeholders [ 23 ] . Warm attitudes on the part of customers , suppliers , employees , and regulators result in enhanced brand value [ 4 , 24 ] , lower employee turnover [ 25 ] , reduced risks of adverse government or activist action [ 26 ] , and , ultimately , greater returns on investors’ capital [ 27 – 30 ] . Navarro [ 31 ] and Webb [ 32 ] assume that corporate donations are part of a ﬁrm’s advertising strategy . Navarro [ 31 ] assumes that CSR spending improves the quantity of sales of the ﬁrm’s product at any price , whereas Webb [ 32 ] considers that CSR spending improves price , at any given output level . Barnea and Rubin [ 33 ] test a model in which management makes CSR expenditures to maximize its self - interest at the expense of shareholders . They reveal some evidence consistent with this agency theory . Related studies examining the relationship between CSR and proﬁtability represent relatively mixed results . Some studies identify a positive relationship , whereas others represent a negative or no relationship [ 5 ] . In particular , the question as to why ﬁrms must invest in CSR has been a subject of debate over the past 20 years [ 4 ] . From the perspective of value enhancement , CSR can enhance shareholder wealth [ 34 – 42 ] . In these studies , Li et al . [ 42 ] reject the over - investment hypothesis that more powerful CEOs tend to invest more in CSR activities for their own reputation building . They conﬁrm that CSR activities are positively related to ﬁrm value and value - enhancing . By contrast , Cheng et al . [ 43 ] opine that CSR is the manifestation of a ﬁrm’s agency problems . Krüger [ 5 ] also believes that CSR primarily beneﬁts managers who earn a good reputation among key stakeholders . From an alternative perspective of agency problems , positive news about CSR is bad news for shareholders . The relationship between CSR and corporate performance has been widely investigated . The results of recent studies tend to conﬁrm a positive relationship between CSR and corporate performance . Studies reach dissimilar conclusions because of differences in samples , methods , and industrial characteristics . In addition , the public in different societies and countries have different opinions regarding CSR . The effects of CSR beneﬁts for companies in different environments are different . Most important of all , we can realize that CSR investments are complicated and uncertain . The beneﬁts ( e . g . , good reputation ) of implementing CSR are not easy to value . After investing in CSR , some ﬁrms obtain a proﬁt , whereas others suffer a great loss . In this uncertain situation , a real options approach is appropriate to value the proﬁts of CSR investments . This paper represents the viewpoints that real options can be used to evaluate CSR in the following . 2 . 2 . CSR and Real Options Addressing questions related to CSR investments is essential . Traditional valuation methods ( e . g . , the net present value ( NPV ) method ) that are used in investment valuation fail to assess the time and operational ﬂexibility of planning , and they consequently underestimate the value of investment planning [ 44 , 45 ] . Husted [ 7 ] believes that ﬁrms often abandon CSR investments when they apply traditional valuation techniques to analyze the cost and beneﬁts of CSR . Furthermore , Cassimon et al . [ 10 ] emphasize that the NPV or a cost – beneﬁt approach ignores the strategic value of CSR investments . To overcome the drawbacks of traditional valuation methods , a real options Sustainability 2018 , 10 , 3532 4 of 14 approach is often applied . Using this approach , investors could defer the decision on investments until a certain environmental characteristic has revealed itself . A real options approach is very popular in the corporate world because of its viability for strategic management and risk analysis [ 46 ] . Several scholars in recent years have adopted a real options approach in the context of investment plan valuation . One advantage of a real options approach is that the value of management ﬂexibility in investment strategies is considered under an uncertain market ; hence , the real value of investments can be captured more accurately . Another advantage is that optimal strategies in an investment can be derived accordingly [ 47 ] . Speciﬁcally , the real options approach can not only capture the real value of an investment or a project more accurately but also help illuminate strategies that could be used during investment . McDonald and Siegel [ 48 ] and Hsu and Lambrecht [ 49 ] emphasize that investing under uncertainty and irreversibility implies renouncing the options to invest in the future ; therefore , investment consideration is a trade - off between postponing investment proﬁts and renouncing such options . McDonald and Siegel [ 50 ] and Dixit and Pindyck [ 51 ] also propose that the execution of an investment plan can be regarded as owning an option under the uncertainties of cost and price . Ziedonis [ 52 ] identiﬁes that ﬁrms are more likely to purchase option contracts for more uncertain technologies . Other theoretical works include those of Carr [ 53 ] , Ritchken and Rabinowitz [ 54 ] , Myers and Majd [ 55 ] , and Lund [ 56 ] . CSR issues and real options approaches have been rapidly developing in the research ﬁeld . However , studies applying real options theory to study CSR are very limited . Regarding related studies , Husted [ 7 ] argues that CSR is a type of real option . He deﬁnes CSR investment as exercising a call option on the beneﬁts of CSR by paying a particular investment cost of CSR . Using real options theory , Husted [ 7 ] develops the notion of CSR as a real option and its implications for risk management . He suggests that CSR should be negatively related to a ﬁrm’s ex ante downside business risk . Peters et al . [ 9 ] explore the conceptual relationship between CSR orientation and real option reasoning . They argue that the ﬁrm’s attitude , communication , and behavior toward CSR are major determinants of the ﬁrm’s sense - making approach to real options . Integrating the previous work of Basu and Palazzo [ 57 ] and that of Barnett [ 58 ] , they propose a new model that extends the inﬂuence of CSR orientation to general strategic decision - making while developing the attention - based view to real options . Cassimon et al . [ 10 ] also use a real options framework to study CSR investment . They extend the Husted [ 7 ] model to explain CSR investment behavior . They present the timing of CSR investment and explain why some companies delay CSR investments . Although the reviewed studies apply the real options perspective or framework to investigate CSR , they mainly explain the strategic values and decisions of CSR and do not construct a model for pricing the value of CSR . This paper highlights that the approach is distinct from prior CSR literature that uses the standard Black – Scholes formula [ 7 – 10 ] . This study constructs a real - options - based model for evaluating ﬁrms and their CSR investment decisions under a dynamic environment . In addition , this study derives a closed - form solution of options and the optimal timing of CSR investment . A corresponding numerical analysis is then conducted for different scenarios with respect to the options value and the threshold of CSR . On the basis of the solutions and numerical analysis , this study reports a number of ﬁndings . 3 . Basic Model Based on Real Options Approach Even if immediate CSR investments may increase a ﬁrm’s value , it is possible that deferring CSR investments is the better option . The options value can be used to judge whether investing in CSR is worthy for the ﬁrm . The options value is measured by using the real options approach . This study attempts to construct the dynamic model for evaluating ﬁrms and their CSR investment decisions . In this model , a real options approach is applied to obtain the ﬁrm valuation of CSR investments in this section . The CSR options value and the optimal timing for implementing CSR are then derived in the following section . Sustainability 2018 , 10 , 3532 5 of 14 In an uncertain environment , the ﬁrm’s value is determined by a stochastic variable , and this uncertainty could be linked to shocks in output prices , p t . According to the models of Lee [ 47 ] , Schwartz and Torous [ 59 ] , and Lambrecht [ 60 ] , this study constructs the basic model and assumptions . Assume that a ﬁrm’s output price , p t , follows a geometric Brownian motion : dp t = α p t dt + σ p t dz ( 1 ) where α denotes the expected growth rate parameter , σ denotes the volatility parameter , and dz denotes the increment of the standard Wiener process . These assumptions and settings above are common and have appeared in many studies . In addition to output prices [ 47 , 60 ] , a similar assumption can be applied to the stock price , the present value of cash ﬂows [ 61 ] , demand shock [ 59 ] , and so on . Firm i ’s cost per unit of input in L i is denoted by w L . The ﬁrm’s instantaneous proﬁt function is given as follows : π i ( p t ) = max L i [ ( p t − p c ) q ( L i ) − w L i L i ] ( 2 ) where p c is a wholesale price or transfer price , which is assumed to be identical for all ﬁrms in this study . The output is determined using a Cobb – Douglas production function : q ( L i ) = L ai K bi . ( 3 ) In the preceding equation , L i denotes the variable production input ( e . g . , labor ) of ﬁrm i , whereas K i is ﬁxed ( e . g . , capital ) . Furthermore , the superscripts a and b denote parameters of economies of scale . The preceding equation suggests that proﬁt maximization requires that ∂π i / ∂ q i = 0 . Therefore , it is straightforward to demonstrate that , in equilibrium , L = (cid:32) a ( p t − p c ) K b w L (cid:33) 11 − a . ( 4 ) For convenience of calculation , let p t − p c = cp and 0 ≤ c ≤ 1 . Substituting the equilibrium production into π yields the ﬁrm’s proﬁt , when the variable input is chosen optimally , as follows : π i ( p t ) = ( a a γ − a γ ) (cid:32) cpK b w aL (cid:33) γ ≡ φ ( a , w L ) (cid:16) cpK b (cid:17) γ ( 5 ) where γ = 11 − a and φ ( a , w L ) = ( a a γ − a γ ) w − a γ L . Applying Ito’s lemma yields a dynamic program of proﬁt function : d π ( p t ) π ( p t ) = (cid:20) αγ + 1 2 γ ( γ − 1 ) σ 2 (cid:21) dt + γσ dz . ( 6 ) If one assumes that investors are risk - neutral and that a risk - free asset exists , yielding a constant interest rate , r , at which investors may borrow or lend freely [ 51 ] , the value of the ﬁrm without engaging in CSR can be given as follows : V ( p t ) = φ (cid:16) cK b (cid:17) γ p γ r − γ ( r − δ ) − 12 γ ( γ − 1 ) σ 2 ≡ ψ p γ ( 7 ) where f ( γ ) = γ ( r − δ ) + 12 γ ( γ − 1 ) σ 2 and ψ = φ r − f ( γ ) (cid:16) cK b (cid:17) γ . f ( γ ) can be considered the growth rate in the Gordon model , and ψ can be considered the quantity index . The value of the ﬁrm can be regarded as the discounted value of all future proﬁts . Sustainability 2018 , 10 , 3532 6 of 14 CSR implementation could increase brand awareness and improve corporate reputation , thus beneﬁting corporate development . Compared with a general company , engaging in CSR could help a company to increase its output ; this is formulated as follows : q ( L i ) = I R L a (cid:48) K b (cid:48) ( 8 ) where I R represents the CSR index and I R ≥ 1 . The parameters a ’ and b ’ are scale parameters of labor and capital . If the efﬁciency of CSR can be developed , a ’ > a and b ’ > b . When the labor input is chosen optimally and the same aforementioned approach is applied , the value of the ﬁrm engaging in CSR , V CSR , is given as follows : V R ( p t ) = ψ R p γ R ( 9 ) where γ R = 1 1 − a (cid:48) , φ R ( a (cid:48) , w (cid:48) L ) = (cid:16) a (cid:48) a (cid:48) γ R − a (cid:48) γ (cid:17) w (cid:48) L − a (cid:48) γ R , and ψ R = φ R r − f ( γ R ) (cid:16) cI R K b (cid:48) (cid:17) γ R . The notation ψ R is the quantity index with CSR . The value function is essentially the same as before , except that the CSR index is now considered and that the scale parameters are now presented as a ’ and b ’ , rather than a and b . The effect of CSR on corporate value can be presented as ∂ V R ( p t ) ∂ I R = γ R I γ R − 1 R ψ R p γ R > 0 . The result shows a positive relationship between the CSR index and corporate value . Engaging in CSR enhances the corporate value , and this value increasing depends on the CSR index , I R . That is , increasing the CSR index ( I R ) and scale parameters of labor and capital ( a ’ and b ’ ) will be a beneﬁt to the ﬁrm’s output and value . However , the cost of CSR is not considered yet . This further calculation will be analyzed in the following section . Regarding the relationship between CSR and corporate value , some studies determine a positive relationship , whereas others identify a negative or no relationship [ 5 ] . In addition , many cases of failure are evident , even when ﬁrms paying much attention to CSR have invested considerable money . First of all , this paper derives the ﬁrm’s value when facing the CSR environment of uncertainty and large cost . In addition to the advantage of output , this paper further considers the cost of CSR investment in the following model to ensure that CSR ﬁrms make the right decisions . Giroud and Mueller [ 62 ] ﬁnd that weak governance ﬁrms have lower labor productivity and higher input costs , and make more value - destroying acquisitions in noncompetitive industries . When the ﬁrms are engaged in CSR , they will have higher labor productivity and lower input costs . By Equation ( 9 ) , this means that a ’ > a and w (cid:48) L > w L , and the value of ﬁrms to engage in CSR ( V R ) is thus increasing . 4 . Results 4 . 1 . Options and Timing of CSR Investments In this section , the CSR options and timing of investing in CSR are studied . When considering a CSR investment , ﬁrms face a trade - off between the stochastic beneﬁts and the costs of CSR , C R . Because investing in CSR is an option and not an obligation for the investors , they invest only when doing so serves their interest . The CSR options are as follows : O ( p t ) = [ ψ R p γ R − ψ p γ − C R ] . ( 10 ) The term ψ R p γ R − ψ p γ represents the beneﬁts of investing in CSR . The beneﬁts will increase by the increasing output price and quantity index with CSR . The options value increases when the beneﬁts increase and costs of CSR decrease . Sustainability 2018 , 10 , 3532 7 of 14 According to the assumptions of the model , the demand shock follows a geometric Brownian motion . The ordinary differential equation of a CSR option is as follows ( refer to Dixit and Pindyck , [ 51 ] ) : 1 2 σ 2 p 2 t O (cid:48)(cid:48) ( p t ) + ( r − δ ) p t O (cid:48) ( p t ) − rO ( p t ) = 0 . ( 11 ) According to Dixit and Pindyck [ 51 ] , the solution of the preceding equation has the following form : O ( p t ) = Bp β , β > 0 ( 12 ) where B and β are constants to be determined . The expression for β > 0 can be obtained by solving the following fundamental quadratic equation : Q ≡ 1 2 σ 2 β ( β − 1 ) + β ( r − δ ) − r = 0 . ( 13 ) This study must consider the boundary conditions to be satisﬁed at a threshold value for entry to close the model : V ( p ) + O ( p ) = V R ( 14 ) V (cid:48) ( p ) + O (cid:48) ( p ) = V (cid:48) R ( 15 ) where p is the threshold to implement CSR investments . Equation ( 14 ) is referred to as the value - matching condition . The second boundary condition , Equation ( 15 ) , is called the high - order contact or smooth - pasting condition . Through the use of the aforementioned boundary condition , B can be solved as follows : B = [ ψ R p γ R − ψ p γ − C R ] p − β . ( 16 ) The ﬁrst investment in CSR occurs when the state variable p t reaches the threshold p from below . The value of the ﬁrm’s option to invest in CSR is given as follows : O ( p t ) = [ ψ R p γ R − ψ p γ − C R ] (cid:18) p t p (cid:19) β . ( 17 ) Interpreting the aforementioned expressions for the value of the CSR options is simple and intuitive . The ﬁrst factor represents the surplus , [ ψ R p γ R − ψ p γ − C R ] , generated at the time of investing in CSR . The factor , ( p t / p ) β , can be considered a discount factor that discounts the surplus back to the present . Lambrecht ( 2004 ) determines that the discount factor can also be interpreted as the probability of the state variable ever reaching the CSR threshold , p , given the current level , p t , of the state variable . When the condition of ∂ O ( p ) / ∂ p = 0 is used , the ordinary differential equations ( ODE ) of CSR can be derived : ( β − γ R ) ψ R p γ R − ( β − γ ) ψ p γ − β C R = 0 . ( 18 ) The threshold p can be used as the standard for addressing the problem of when to invest in CSR . The optimal threshold for investing in CSR can be derived as follows : p = (cid:20) β C R ( β − γ ) ( ψ R p γ R − ψ p γ ) (cid:21) 1 γ . The optimal timing , T , to invest in CSR can be denoted as follows : T = inf [ t ≥ 0 : p ( t ) ≥ p ] . According to the preceding solution of the optimal threshold , this study determines that the optimal threshold comprises three terms : the ﬁrst term , C R , represents the CSR cost effect . Increasing the costs of CSR increases the threshold to invest in CSR . The second term , β / ( β − γ ) , represents the hysteresis factor , and β > γ . When the value of a hysteresis factor increases , the threshold to invest in CSR is increased and the CSR investment is delayed . In addition , increasing uncertainty ( σ ) lowers β , thereby Sustainability 2018 , 10 , 3532 8 of 14 increasing the hysteresis factor and subsequently the CSR threshold . A standard result from real options theory is that a higher level of uncertainty delays investments [ 51 ] . The third term represents the synergy factor , ψ R p γ R − ψ p γ . This synergy factor ( V R − V ) can be viewed as a result of engaging in CSR , and the result will be affected by the CSR index ( I R ) and scale parameters of labor and capital ( a ’ and b ’ ) . When the quantity index with CSR , ψ R , and output price with CSR increase , the CSR synergy increases . The CSR beneﬁt hence increases and CSR investment is expedited . For example , Giroud and Mueller [ 62 ] ﬁnd that ﬁrms in noncompetitive industries should beneﬁt relatively more from good governance . In this case , investing in CSR will increase CSR synergy and then decrease the optimal threshold ( p ) for investing in CSR . That is , the ﬁrms will advance the optimal timing of CSR investments in noncompetitive environments . This paper builds the theoretical model to derive the optimal timing of CSR investments . When the revenue of investing in CSR is larger than the CSR cost , CSR investment obtains a positive proﬁt and is a good investment decision . However , when the CSR environment is unfavorable to companies ( i . e . , CSR cost and hysteresis factor are higher and synergy factor decreases ) , they should defer the investment decisions until the investment conditions of CSR have changed . 4 . 2 . Numerical Results and Discussions This study derives ﬁrm values , options values , and the optimal timing of investing in CSR ; therefore , a numerical analysis of the results is necessary . 4 . 2 . 1 . The Parameter Settings In this section , the numerical analysis is used to study the optimal valuations and decisions of CSR investments . From the previous section , the closed - form solutions for options and the optimal threshold of CSR investment are derived . This paper uses numerical analysis to explore further the effects of investment conditions on options value and the optimal threshold . We have to set parameters to conduct a numerical analysis . The parameter values in this study are outlined as follows : the risk - free interest rate is 2 % , the convenience yield δ is 1 % , the output price is 1 . 2 , β is 1 . 4 , C R is 0 . 6 . , γ and γ R are 1 . 2 and 1 . 5 , respectively , and ψ and ψ R are 1 . 5 and 2 , respectively . On the basis of the preceding information and assumptions , this study ﬁrst conducts a sensitivity analysis among the options value , investment threshold , and CSR costs ; the result is presented in Figure 1 . The following analysis and discussion are the options value with different CSR costs and investment efﬁciencies in Figure 2 . The impacts of changes in CSR costs and investment efﬁciencies on the optimal thresholds are analyzed in Figure 3 . The thresholds with different output prices and CSR investment efﬁciencies are represented in Figure 4 . Sustainability 2018 , 10 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 13 ( i . e . , CSR cost and hysteresis factor are higher and synergy factor decreases ) , they should defer the investment decisions until the investment conditions of CSR have changed . 4 . 2 . Numerical Results and Discussions This study derives firm values , options values , and the optimal timing of investing in CSR ; therefore , a numerical analysis of the results is necessary . 4 . 2 . 1 . The Parameter Settings In this section , the numerical analysis is used to study the optimal valuations and decisions of CSR investments . From the previous section , the closed - form solutions for options and the optimal threshold of CSR investment are derived . This paper uses numerical analysis to explore further the effects of investment conditions on options value and the optimal threshold . We have to set parameters to conduct a numerical analysis . The parameter values in this study are outlined as follows : the risk - free interest rate is 2 % , the convenience yield δ is 1 % , the output price is 1 . 2 , 𝛽 is 1 . 4 , C R is 0 . 6 . , 𝛾 and 𝛾 𝑅 are 1 . 2 and 1 . 5 , respectively , and 𝜓 and 𝜓 𝑅 are 1 . 5 and 2 , respectively . On the basis of the preceding information and assumptions , this study first conducts a sensitivity analysis among the options value , investment threshold , and CSR costs ; the result is presented in Figure 1 . The following analysis and discussion are the options value with different CSR costs and investment efficiencies in Figure 2 . The impacts of changes in CSR costs and investment efficiencies on the optimal thresholds are analyzed in Figure 3 . The thresholds with different output prices and CSR investment efficiencies are represented in Figure 4 . 4 . 2 . 2 . The Effects of CSR on Investment Decisions In Figure 1 , the vertical axis represents the options value , and the horizontal axis represents the CSR investment threshold , 𝑝̅ . The relationship between 𝑝̅ and the options value is presented separately according to CSR investment cost ( C R ) settings of 0 . 5 , 0 . 6 , and 0 . 7 . In Figure 1 , they are displayed as a dotted line , thin solid line , and thick solid line , respectively . The results show that a high 𝑝̅ value leads to a low options value , indicating a nonlinear relationship between them . When 𝐶 𝑅 = 0 . 5 , the options value is higher than that when C R is 0 . 6 or 0 . 7 , revealing that a low CSR investment cost leads to high CSR benefits and a high options value ; this finding is consistent with the general intuition . Regardless of whether C R is 0 . 5 or 0 . 7 , the options value approximates 0 when 𝑝̅ is greater than 1 . 2 , which indicates a decrease in the likelihood of companies investing in CSR when 𝑝̅ increases . Under this condition , the impact of C R on the options value is slight . Figure 1 . The options value with different price threshold and corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) costs . Figure 1 .

Sustainability 2018 , 10 , 3532 9 of 14 Sustainability 2018 , 10 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 13 The vertical axis in Figure 2 represents the options value , and the horizontal axis represents C R .

Because the options value is larger than 0 , it does not exhibit a negative value in the figure . The greater the options value , the more likely and sooner the companies would be to invest in CSR .

The results indicate that output prices and 𝜓 𝑅 are negatively correlated with 𝑝̅ , meaning that an increase in output prices or 𝜓 𝑅 leads to earlier investments in CSR by companies . This finding verifies that an industry boom with rising product prices is conducive to companies’ investments in CSR . In addition , when the output price is low ( i . e . , p < 1 . 2 ) , the investment threshold is high but decreases rapidly with increasing price . When the output price is high ( i . e . , p > 2 ) , the effects of increasing output price on CSR investments are not significant . Figure 4 . The thresholds with different output prices and CSR investment efficiencies . Previous literatures examined the relationship between CSR and profitability and found relatively mixed results . The effects of CSR benefits on companies in different environments are different . These results reflect that the situation of CSR investments is dynamic and complicated . Cassimon et al . [ 10 ] indicate that the question as to when a company should invest in CSR is largely underdeveloped . This is an important solution in explaining companies’ investment decision . This paper constructs a real options model of CSR investments with fluctuating gross profits and obtains closed - form solutions of firm’s value , options , and the optimal timing of CSR investments . Numerical analysis is applied to inspect and study the results of closed - form solutions . Based on those solutions and numerical analysis , this study has a few findings . The results show that an increase in CSR benefits ( i . e . , increasing output price and quantity index ) will accelerate investment timing , whereas an increase in CSR cost will delay it . This finding verifies that an industry boom with rising product prices is conducive to firms’ investments in CSR . In this situation , the CSR benefits are high , CSR investments are active , and the options value hence remains positive and large despite the high CSR cost . 5 . Conclusions A few studies including Husted [ 7 ] , Hitch et al . [ 8 ] , Peters et al . [ 9 ] , and Cassimon et al . [ 10 ] have used the real options framework to study CSR investments . However , they focus on the conceptual explanation or apply the standard Black – Scholes model to analyze CSR investments . In contrast to the previous studies , this study applies a real options approach to construct a dynamic model for evaluating CSR , in which CSR options are evaluated to determine whether investing in CSR is worthwhile for investors or firms . This study assumes that sales profits follow a stochastic process and that company value varies with sales profits . Accordingly , the real options approach is applied to derive the company and options valuation of CSR investments and the optimal threshold to engage in CSR . In addition , this paper further explores these values based on numerical analysis and firms’ Figure 4 . The thresholds with different output prices and CSR investment efﬁciencies . 4 . 2 . 2 . The Effects of CSR on Investment Decisions In Figure 1 , the vertical axis represents the options value , and the horizontal axis represents the CSR investment threshold , p . The relationship between p and the options value is presented separately according to CSR investment cost ( C R ) settings of 0 . 5 , 0 . 6 , and 0 . 7 . In Figure 1 , they are displayed as a dotted line , thin solid line , and thick solid line , respectively . The results show that a high p value leads to a low options value , indicating a nonlinear relationship between them . When C R = 0 . 5 , the options Sustainability 2018 , 10 , 3532 10 of 14 value is higher than that when C R is 0 . 6 or 0 . 7 , revealing that a low CSR investment cost leads to high CSR beneﬁts and a high options value ; this ﬁnding is consistent with the general intuition . Regardless of whether C R is 0 . 5 or 0 . 7 , the options value approximates 0 when p is greater than 1 . 2 , which indicates a decrease in the likelihood of companies investing in CSR when p increases . Under this condition , the impact of C R on the options value is slight . The vertical axis in Figure 2 represents the options value , and the horizontal axis represents C R . The relationship between C R and the options value in this study is presented separately according to the quantity index ( ψ R ) settings of 1 . 6 , 2 , and 2 . 4 , which are displayed as a dotted line , thin solid line , and thick solid line , respectively . Because the options value is larger than 0 , it does not exhibit a negative value in the ﬁgure . The greater the options value , the more likely and sooner the companies would be to invest in CSR . According to the results , the higher the C R is , the lower the options value is , indicating a negative linear relationship . When ψ R = 2 . 4 , the options value is greater than that of a ψ R value of 2 and 1 . 6 , showing that high CSR beneﬁts lead to a higher ψ R and thus a high options value . When ψ R = 1 . 6 , the CSR beneﬁts are low ; hence , the options value equals 0 despite the lower C R ( e . g . , when C R = 0 . 3 ) , and the willingness of companies to invest in CSR would be very low . By contrast , when ψ R = 2 . 4 , the CSR beneﬁts are high ; hence , the options value remains positive despite the high C R ( e . g . , C R = 1 . 2 ) , reﬂecting active CSR investment among companies . The vertical axis in Figure 3 denotes p , and the horizontal axis denotes C R . The relationship between C R and p is represented separately according to the quantity index ( ψ R ) settings of 1 . 6 , 2 , and 2 . 4 . The results show that the higher the C R is , the higher the p is , indicating a nonlinear relationship . The relationship under the ψ R value of 1 . 6 is represented by a dotted line in the ﬁgure . Because of the smaller CSR beneﬁts , p increases substantially from 0 to 25 as C R increases from 0 to 1 . 5 . The relationship derived from the ψ R value of 2 . 4 is depicted by a thick solid line . Because of the higher CSR beneﬁts , the increase in C R merely facilitates a slight increase in p from 0 to close to 5 . The results indicate that an increase in CSR cost would delay investment timing , whereas an increase in CSR beneﬁts would accelerate investment timing . The study then discusses the impacts of CSR beneﬁts on p ( Figure 4 ) . The vertical axis in the ﬁgure represents p , whereas the horizontal axis represents the p . The relationship between p and p is explored according to the CSR beneﬁts , with ψ R values of 1 . 6 , 2 , and 2 . 4 represented by a dotted line , thin solid line , and thick solid line , respectively .

[ 10 ] have used the real options framework to study CSR investments . However , they focus on the conceptual explanation or apply the standard Black – Scholes model to analyze CSR investments . In contrast to the previous studies , this study applies a real options approach to construct a dynamic model for evaluating CSR , in which CSR options are evaluated to determine whether investing in CSR is worthwhile for investors or ﬁrms . This study assumes that sales proﬁts follow a stochastic process and that company value varies with sales proﬁts . Accordingly , the real options approach is applied to derive the company and options valuation of CSR investments and the optimal threshold to engage in CSR . In addition , this paper further explores these values based on numerical analysis and ﬁrms’ corresponding investment decisions . This study sheds some light on the values of CSR investments in a dynamic environment and hence the decisions of investors . The relationship between CSR and corporate performance has been widely investigated . Implementing CSR has a positive impact and revenue but CSR investors could suffer a great cost . Some studies identify a positive relationship between CSR and proﬁtability , whereas others ﬁnd a negative relationship [ 5 ] . Cheng et al . [ 43 ] opine that CSR is the manifestation of a ﬁrm’s agency problems . By contrast , Li et al . [ 42 ] provide strong evidence against the over - investment hypothesis based on the agency theory , conﬁrming that CSR activities are positively related to ﬁrm value . Many studies identify that CSR can enhance shareholder wealth . However , the negative relationship may present large cost , low proﬁt , or over - investment of CSR . These dissimilar conclusions in the literature probably result from the differences in samples , methods , and industrial characteristics . The effects of CSR beneﬁts on companies in different environments are different . In addition , these results also reﬂect that the performances of CSR investments are complicated and uncertain . Kytle and Ruggie [ 63 ] think that CSR is considered to be risky because of no deﬁnite valuation for the CSR option . Therefore , this study applies a real options approach to construct the dynamic model to derive the ﬁrms’ valuation and the optimal timing for implementing CSR . Cassimon et al . [ 10 ] indicate that the question is when a company should invest in CSR . A real options approach is suitable to evaluate the uncertainty of CSR investments . With real options , ﬁrms can decide whether and further when to invest in CSR . However , related studies cannot exactly determine the optimal timing to invest in CSR . This paper builds the model when ﬁrms face a trade - off between the stochastic beneﬁts and the costs of CSR . Firms invest in CSR only when doing so serves their interest . This paper derives the optimal timing to invest in CSR and that can help investors to make the best decisions . When the revenue of investing in CSR is larger than the CSR cost , CSR investment yields a positive proﬁt and is a good investment decision . The investment threshold of CSR is thus low and CSR investment is expedited . However , companies should defer the investment decisions until the investment conditions of CSR have changed if the CSR environment is unfavorable to companies ( e . g . , the CSR cost and hysteresis factor are higher and synergy factor decreases ) . Finally , this study provides numerical analyses and results to verify the established model . This paper shows that the relationship between CSR options and the investment threshold is nonlinear and negative . The numerical results indicate that an increase in CSR cost will delay investment timing , whereas an increase in CSR beneﬁts and output prices will lead to earlier investments in CSR . This study is the ﬁrst to use a real - options - based valuation model to derive closed - form solutions for options and the optimal timing of CSR investment , and thus contributes substantially to the evaluation of CSR investments . Moreover , this paper elucidates not only the value of CSR but also the decision to invest in CSR . Funding : This research received no external funding .
