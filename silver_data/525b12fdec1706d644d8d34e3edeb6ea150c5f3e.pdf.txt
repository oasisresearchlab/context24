B udding of spherical vesicles is essential for membrane trafﬁcking . Clathrin was the ﬁrst protein found to be involved in this process 1 , 2 . Clathrin polymerizes into truncated icosahedral cages in vitro 3 and together with various partners 4 deforms the membrane into a spherical bud 5 – 7 . Among the mechanisms involved in bud formation , amphipathic insertions , which act as wedges to create curvature , and the crowding effect 8 of proteins binding asymmetrically to the membrane have been investigated . On the contrary , clathrin was proposed to act by scaffolding , meaning that a protein coat of a given shape forces the membrane to curve 4 . The structure of the smallest clathrin cage is known in great detail 9 – 11 . However , clathrin also forms ﬂat hexagonal lattices at the plasma membrane of cells 12 , and spherical coated vesicles of various sizes , ranging from 35 to 200 nm , in various organisms 13 . This variability in size and shape has called into question the initially proposed membrane scaffolding mechanism based on clathrin polymerization . Clathrin binds membranes through a wide variety of adaptors including adaptin protein complexes ( AP - 1 , AP - 2 , AP - 3 and AP - 4 ) , AP180 / CALM , GGAs and Hrs 14 . Adaptors are speciﬁc to subsets of clathrin - mediated membrane trafﬁc pathways . In particular , AP180 has a high ability to polymerize clathrin in vitro , and forms smaller clathrin cages than clathrin alone 15 . AP180 has an ANTH domain that binds phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) 5 . However , it forms shallow pits when reconstituted on lipid monolayers 5 and does not bud the membrane of large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) 6 . These results suggested that clathrin polymerization energy was not the dominant factor in controlling the shape of clathrin coats . On the contrary , epsin 16 , a clathrin adaptor structurally similar to AP180 , facilitates the clathrin assembly on membranes into highly curved coated buds 17 . Although less potent in clathrin polymerization , epsin has an ENTH domain containing an amphipathic helix - 0 that wedges itself into the outer membrane leaﬂet , helping the build - up of curvature 17 . This supports the direct role of adaptors in curvature generation . Lipid membranes are deformable , ﬂuid surfaces 18 . To deform a membrane by scaffolding , the energetic gain upon coat poly - merization must be at least equal to the energetic cost associated with membrane deformation . The clathrin polymerization energy has never been compared with membrane budding energy . This depends on membrane tension , rigidity and geometry of the bud . We thus questioned how parameters of membrane elasticity ( that are , tension and rigidity ) could affect clathrin polymerization . Results Membrane tension opposes clathrin polymerization . To study the mechanism by which clathrin deforms the membrane , we reconstituted clathrin coats onto giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs , 5 – 50 m m ) . We used GUVs containing 30 % 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoserine ( DOPS ) and 10 % PIP 2 ( see Methods ) , mimicking the composition of the inner plasma membrane leaﬂet . The use of 10 % PIP 2 , although higher than physiological concentration , was used to rule out afﬁnity differ - ences between adaptors . Moreover , the physiological concentra - tion of PIP 2 within a clathrin - coated pit remains unknown . GUVs labelled with 1 % of tetra - methyl rhodamine ( TMR ) - PIP 2 were incubated with 0 . 5 m M puriﬁed AP180 and 0 . 4 m M puriﬁed clathrin containing 20 mol % of Alexa Fluor 488 - labelled clathrin ( AF488 - Clathrin ) ( see Methods ) . As expected , clathrin bound to GUVs only in the presence of the AP180 adaptor ( Fig . 1a , b ) and brain PIP 2 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . After clathrin binding , clathrin appeared as a homogenous stain , colocalizing with the membrane signal ( Fig . 1b ) . Clathrin formed a solid coat , as shown by the absence of recovery of coat ﬂuorescence after photobleaching ( Fig . 1c ) . Next , we studied the submicron structure of the clathrin coat using negative - stain electron microscopy ( EM ) of clathrin - coated LUVs . As previously reported 5 , 6 , we observed in most of the cases , small ( a few tens of nm ) , clathrin assemblies ( Figs 1d , e and 2e ; Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , covering the surface of the LUVs . The depth of these clathrin pits was difﬁcult to address by negative stain , although many of them seemed rather shallow ( Fig . 1e ) . Furthermore , the LUVs retained their round shape consistently with our confocal images of non - deformed GUVs . Importantly , all structures observed had limited depth ( see Fig . 1c , and inset of Fig . 2e , isotonic ; Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . As clathrin / AP180 forms highly curved cages in vitro in the absence of membrane 15 , we hypothesized that the combined effect of tension and bending rigidity was responsible for the impairment of full budding by opposing the clathrin polymerization energy . To conﬁrm whether changes in membrane tension affected polymerization of clathrin , we transferred GUVs made in 208 ± 1 mOsm sucrose solution to a clathrin / AP180 solution of varying osmolarity . We examined clathrin polymerization on GUVs under hypotonic ( 180 ± 1 mOsm ) , isotonic ( 208 ± 1 mOsm ) and hypertonic ( 236 ± 1 mOsm ) external buffer conditions . In isotonic conditions , no optically visible deforma - tions of GUVs were observed ( Fig . 1f , h ) . We observed that under hypotonic conditions GUVs did not allow AP180 / clathrin binding in most cases ( Fig . 1f , g ) . We observed that ﬂuorescent AP180 was binding efﬁciently under all osmotic conditions ( Fig . 1i ) with the same density ( see Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , even in the presence of clathrin . Furthermore , the binding of the terminal domain of clathrin ( clathrin TD ) to AP180 did not change signiﬁcantly with the change of osmotic conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . We thus concluded that increased membrane tension could totally impair clathrin polymerization . Also , as the surface density of the AP180 did not change in the presence of clathrin ( see Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , and since no deformation of the membrane was observed in presence of 0 . 5 m M AP180 alone in all osmotic conditions , we concluded that protein crowding had only a negligible effect , if any . While the 10 % PIP 2 concentration used provides more than enough binding sites to induce membrane deformation by crowding , the low afﬁnity of AP180 ANTH domain for PIP 2 ( a few micromolars , see ref . 5 ) , and the low AP180 concentration in our assay meant that not all binding sites were occupied . This accounts for the absence of membrane deformation mediated by AP180 crowding . Strikingly , both clathrin and membrane ﬂuorescence signals were strongly increased under hypertonic conditions ( Fig . 1f , g ) . In many cases , long , highly coated membrane tubules emanated from the GUVs , suggesting that under hypertonic conditions , the membrane could be heavily deformed by the clathrin coat ( Fig . 1f ) . We also observed ﬁve times more deformed GUVs in hypertonic conditions than in any other osmotic condition ( Fig . 1h ) . These deformations appeared a few minutes after clathrin addition ( see Supplementary Fig . 5a ) , which was consistent with the time it took to saturate the membrane with clathrin . AF488 - clathrin / AP180 - coated GUVs in isotonic condi - tions did not show more deformation when subjected to hypertonic shock ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . These results support our hypothesis that GUV deformation was a result of clathrin polymerization . To better characterize the shape of the membrane deforma - tions , GUVs incubated with AP180 / clathrin under varying osmotic conditions were ﬁxed and processed for thin - section electron microscopy ( TEM , see methods ) . Similar to the confocal images , TEM also revealed uncoated membranes when GUVs were incubated with proteins under hypotonic conditions ( Fig . 2a , d ) . GUVs incubated under isotonic conditions revealed ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms7249 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 6 : 6249 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms7249 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications & 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Furthermore , LUVs incubated with AP180 / clathrin under isotonic conditions ( see Fig . 2e ) remained round shaped , as seen by negative - stain EM . On these images ( see also Supplementary Fig . 2 ) the surface of the LUVs was covered with limited assemblies of clathrin , conﬁrming that the electron - dense coat seen by TEM was indeed a proper clathrin coat . However , these images show that rather than a purely hexagonal ﬂat lattice , the clathrin coat was constituted of densely packed shallow buds on the membrane ( see Fig . 1d , e and Supplementary Fig . 2 , monolayer and isotonic ) . Finally , GUVs incubated under hypertonic conditions showed an entirely budded surface , covered with an electron - dense coat ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Coated membrane buds were observed with an average diameter of 65 ± 5 nm , close to values of in vitro formed AP180 / clathrin cages 15 .

In summary , observations made by EM ( both TEM and negative stain ) were consistent with our confocal microscopy data ( Fig . 1 ) , and conﬁrmed that AP180 and clathrin can deform the membrane in a membrane tension - dependent way . Membrane elastic energy against clathrin polymerization energy . To quantitatively test our hypothesis , we developed a theoretical model that describes the competition between clathrin polymerization , which favours full budding , membrane tension and rigidity , which favour planar membranes , to predict transi - tions between different possible bud shapes ( see Fig . 3a ) . In the model , a ﬂat membrane with tension s , and bending rigidity k , is in contact with a clathrin / AP180 solution at ﬁxed concentrations . We denoted by m the free energy gain associated with the poly - merization of a unit area of clathrin coat . As membrane - bound clathrin coats are very rigid ( bending rigidity k c C 300 k B T 19 ) , we assumed that clathrin always polymerizes into spheres of ﬁxed radius r c . In our model , tension cannot modify the coat’s radius , but it can limit clathrin polymerization to partial buds as illustrated in Fig . 3a , b .

This coat is traversed by a small membrane tether of negligible energy 20 that connects the membrane bud to the main membrane . This connection is the only difference between our full buds and free clathrin - coated vesicles . This description is consistent with the partial coats observed by negative - stain EM ( Fig . 2e ; Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . To support this geometrical picture , we measured the average size of partial buds grown on mica - supported bilayers by atomic force microscopy to ﬁnd a height of 15 – 20 nm , and a diameter of 80 – 100 nm ( see Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Subtracting the B 15 nm thickness of the clathrin coat , these measurements are consistent with membrane buds of B 30 nm radius , and a depth of a few nanometres as illustrated in Fig . 3b . This model is also consistent with our EM studies , where we observed bare membranes in hypotonic conditions ( Fig . 2a ) , shallow buds in isotonic conditions ( Fig . 2a , e ) and deep buds in hypertonic conditions ( Fig . 2a , f ) . These observations support our assumption that AP180 / clathrin mostly polymerizes with a roughly constant radius of curvature r c . From our TEM pictures in hypertonic conditions ( see above and Fig . 2 ) , we thus concluded that r c ¼ 32 . 5 nm . In the model , we decomposed the polymerization energy of clathrin into two contributions ; m ¼ m 0 (cid:2) k = 2 r 2c (cid:2) (cid:3) , where m 0 is the Bare membrane Shallowpartial bud Deep partial bud A c L A m Full buds 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 GUV OT Force B e f o r e A ft e r 2422201816141210860 50 Time ( s ) 100 150 F o r c e p N AF488 - clathrin Clathrinaddition F drop TMR - PIP2 Δ R A m , A c Δ L tongue Micropipette Clathrin coat Injection micropipette 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 C l a t h r i n po l y m e r i z a t i on ene r g y (cid:2) ( m N m – 1 ) 0 Membrane tension (cid:3) ( mN m – 1 ) 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 1 10 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 Line tension τ ( pN ) 10 2 10 3 Bare membrane Shallow buds Deep buds Full buds 10 4 (cid:2) · r C S c a l ed c l a t h r i n po l . ene r g y (cid:4) (cid:3) · r C Scaled membrane tension (cid:4) Figure 3 | Model and clathrin polymerization energy measurements .

In addition , we introduced the coat’s line tension t , describing the energetic cost of broken clathrin – clathrin bonds at the boundary of a partial bud . This leads to the following expression for the free energy of a single bud : f ¼ s A m (cid:2) m A c þ t L ð 1 Þ where A m and A c are the membrane and coat areas , respectively , associated with one bud , and L is the length of its rim ( Fig . 3a ) . In this expression , m is dimensionally equivalent to a force per unit length , and represents the net force that a clathrin coat applies on the membrane while polymerizing . The membrane tension s and the bending rigidity k oppose this force , while the coat’s line tension t favours buds with short rims . To make predictions at the liposome level , we applied this theoretical framework to a densely packed assembly of coated buds ( see Fig . 3b and Supplementary Discussion ) . Depending on the value of the parameters , we can analytically predict the shape of the clathrin buds ( bare membrane , shallow / deep partial buds or full buds ) as shown in the phase diagram Fig . 3c . Qualitatively , for low clathrin polymerization energies ( m r 2 t / r c ) , the membrane is either bare for high tensions ( s 4 m ) or fully budded if s r m . These two regimes still exist at high polymerization energies ( m 4 2 t / r c ) , but with the added possibility of partial buds at moderate tensions . This high polymerization energy situation reproduces our above observations of GUVs under various osmotic conditions . We observed no polymerization for high tensions , and full budding for low tensions . Moreover , we do not observe purely hexagonal lattices ( see Fig . 2 , and also Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , and thus interpret the continuous ﬂuorescent staining of clathrin on GUVs ( Fig . 1 ) in isotonic conditions as a dense coverage of contiguous shallow buds ( see Figs 1e and 3b ) . To validate our model , we measured membrane tension s and clathrin polymerization energy m . We used an in vitro micro - manipulation assay ( see Fig . 3d ) 21 to pull a membrane nanotube out of GUVs by means of a streptavidin bead held in optical tweezers . We modulated the membrane tension s by aspirating the GUV in a micropipette . This technique allowed us to quantify and control tension in a way that cannot be achieved by osmotic shock . We measured the force F required to maintain the tube using optical tweezers . In the absence of clathrin , this force is given by 22 F ¼ 2 p ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 ks p , allowing us to measure 23 the membrane bending modulus k ¼ 13 ± 5 k B T . Once the tube was formed , a mix of AP180 and AF488 - clathrin in isotonic buffer was injected using a second micropipette ( see Methods and Fig . 3d ) . Clathrin binding was observed along the membrane tube and on the GUV surface . Clathrin GUV staining was homogeneous ( Fig . 3e ) , consistent with the formation of a continuous ﬂat coat as in Fig . 1a , b . Following clathrin polymerization , we observed a reduction of the total apparent GUV membrane area in 87 % of all experiments , consistent with the sequestration of the membrane into clathrin - coated pits ( see Fig . 3d , f ; Supplementary Table 1 ) . The 6 % reduction of the apparent GUV area ( see Supplementary Table 1 ) allowed us to calculate an average bud depth of 2 nm , which is consistent with our EM data . During clathrin polymerization on the GUV and the tube , we measured a drop in the tube force ( see Fig . 3f ) . AP180 alone did not induce a signiﬁcant force drop when binding to the tubes ( see Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . In cases where the apparent membrane area decreased , we used our mathematical model to infer the values of the parameters m and t from the decrease in apparent membrane area and tube force ( Supplementary Discussion ) . The resulting values are given in Supplementary Table 1 and denoted by full circles in the phase diagram of Fig . 3g ( colour code identical to Fig . 3c ) . In all cases , the measured values of m and s fell in the shallow bud regime , conﬁrming our hypothesis that continuous staining of clathrin - coated GUVs in isotonic conditions were indeed contiguous shallow buds . The measured value of the clathrin polymerization energy per unit area was equal to 7 . 6 ± 5 . 4 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 5 N . m (cid:2) 1 , with m 0 ¼ 1 . 0 ± 0 . 5 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 4 N . m (cid:2) 1 . We found t ¼ 5 . 2 ± 7 . 4 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 2 pN , well below values at which line tension is able to bud membrane domains on its own ( typically 1 pN , see ref . 24 ) . This supports our hypothesis that membrane bending is primarily due to clathrin polymerization and not due to the line tension . The clathrin polymerization energy is the sum of two contributions : clathrin – clathrin interactions and clathrin – membrane interactions mediated by the adaptors , which we express as m 0 ¼ m c (cid:2) c þ m c (cid:2) m . In the scaffolding mechanism , clathrin polymerization is the main driver of membrane deformation , implying that m c (cid:2) c is much larger than m c (cid:2) m . To test this model , we estimated the relative importance of m c (cid:2) c and m c (cid:2) m by measuring the force required to rupture the clathrin coat . We aspirated clathrin - coated GUV using a micropipette of radius R p C 1 m m ( Fig . 4a ) in isotonic conditions .

Upon increasing the aspiration pressure above D P c ¼ 231 ± 26 Pa , we observed a sudden rupture of the coat along the rim of the pipette followed by marked membrane tongue elongation ( Fig . 4a , b ) . The resulting cracks within the coat were visible both during a prolonged aspirated state and after releasing the aspiration ( Fig . 4c ) . We reasoned that rupturing the coat in this way disrupted the clathrin – clathrin bonds while leaving the clathrin – membrane interactions unaffected , thus allowing us to estimate m c (cid:2) c independently of m c (cid:2) m . From D P c and R p , we estimated m c (cid:2) c ¼ 1 . 1 ± 0 . 1 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 4 N . m (cid:2) 1 ( see Supplementary Note 1 ) . This value is indistinguishable from m 0 ¼ 1 . 0 ± 0 . 5 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 4 N . m (cid:2) 1 , conﬁrming that clathrin – clathrin interactions are the predomi - nant interactions responsible for clathrin coat’s assembly as in the scaffolding model . Multiplying m c (cid:2) c by the speciﬁc area a C 800nm 2 occupied by a triskelion ( see Supplementary Note 2 ) yields the binding energy per triskelion a m c (cid:2) c ¼ 23 ± 3 k B T . Our value of the binding energy is consistent with a previous theoretical estimate based on the critical concentration of clathrin polymerization 25 , a m c (cid:2) c ¼ 42 k B T , and with estimates coming from computational assembly statistics 26 , where a m c (cid:2) c ¼ 23 k B T . Also , it is too large to allow for internal rearrangements of the clathrin lattice once polymerized , implying that clathrin buds directly polymerize into curved structures rather than going through a hexagonal ﬂat coat intermediate . Espin facilitates clathrin polymerization . To further validate our model , we used these results to predict the shape of clathrin coats by changing parameters . We tested this prediction experimentally by investigating the predicted role of the bending rigidity in inhibiting budding . The expression m ¼ m 0 (cid:2) k = 2 r 2 c (cid:2) (cid:3) implies that an increased k should reduce the value of the polymerization energy m . We used GUVs of higher bending rigidity obtained by TMR - PIP2 AF488 - clathrin AP180 / AF488 - clathrin on high bending rigidity GUVs Epsin / AF - clathrin on normal GUVs TMR - PIP2 AF488 - clathrin Hypo Hypo Hypo 50 40 N o . o f v e s i c l e s P e r c en t age v e s i c l e ( % ) 30 20 10 0 Iso Iso Binding No binding No deformation Small deformation Large deformation Hyper Hyper Hypo TMR - PIP2 AF488 - AP180 Iso Hyper Hypo Iso Hyper T M R - P I P 2 A F 488 - c l a t h r i n 100 80 60 40 20 0 Figure 5 | Effect of high bending rigidity and epsin on the clathrin budding abilities .

This decreased the average value of m by more than an order of magnitude ( m stiff ¼ 3 . 7 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 6 N . m (cid:2) 1 ) , implying a marked decrease of the maximum tension allowing clathrin assembly to 3 . 5 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 6 N . m (cid:2) 1 . Consistent with our expectation , clathrin failed to bind to a vast majority of liposomes ( Fig . 5a ) under isotonic conditions despite signiﬁcant binding of AP180 ( Fig . 5d ) . We further tested whether clathrin polymerization could be restored by changing membrane tension , but did not observe any clathrin binding neither under hypotonic nor hypertonic conditions ( see Fig . 5b , c ) , further showing the inﬂuence of membrane bending rigidity on clathrin polymerization . To further test our model , we predicted that any adaptors with membrane - deforming properties should assist budding . We thus studied the polymerization of clathrin on GUVs as mediated by epsin . We found that epsin binds to liposomes under all tested membrane tensions ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) without causing observable deformations , as does AP180 . When GUVs were incubated with the unlabelled epsin and AF488 - clathrin under hypotonic conditions , 70 % of the vesicles showed membrane deformations ( Fig . 5e , f ) . Signiﬁcant membrane deformation and tubulation were also observed under isotonic conditions . Like - wise , under hypertonic conditions the GUVs were highly deformed ( Fig . 5d ) . Thus the membrane - deforming properties of epsin facilitated clathrin polymerization to such an extent that it was able to bind to GUVs even under unfavourable membrane tension conditions . Discussion In this study , we showed that the shape of clathrin coats is controlled by membrane tension . This mechanism is based on counteracting clathrin polymerization by membrane tension , which hinders the closure of the clathrin - coated pits : at low membrane tension , deep buds can form , whereas intermediate or high tensions will only result in partial budding . We measured the clathrin polymerization energy and found values that are in the range of in vivo membrane tension values ( 10 (cid:2) 5 – 10 (cid:2) 4 N . m (cid:2) 1 —see refs 27 – 29 ) . Thus , in vivo values of membrane tension cover the shape transition from a shallow to a deep budded coat , supporting a physiological control of clathrin budding through membrane tension . It is consistent with the fact that clathrin - mediated endocytosis is delayed in cells that have higher membrane tension and require actin for completion 30 , 31 . We imagine that at the structural level , membrane tension does not allow for the correct binding angle between arms of the triskelia , impairing their correct association . We also found that increased membrane rigidity opposes clathrin budding . It is consistent with the fact that clathrin - mediated endocytosis is slower at the apical pole of epithelia , where the membrane is more rigid than at the basal pole 32 . We also found that the membrane - deforming ability of epsin favours clathrin - mediated budding , even when the membrane’s elastic parameters ( namely tension and rigidity ) are not favourable . This indicates that the different actors that can generate membrane curvature ( wedge insertion , crowding or local forces exerted by the cytoskeleton ) can act synergistically to deform the membrane : the role of adaptors and actin in clathrin - induced membrane deformation has been studied extensively . However , conclusions about whether they are required or sufﬁcient for membrane deformation proved themselves difﬁcult to generalize to all biological systems . Our results support a modulatory role of each adaptor and actin depending on the difﬁculty of deforming the membrane 31 : in an extreme case where the membrane is very stiff and tension is high , all partners are required , whereas they become dispensable in intermediate conditions . For energetic 25 , kinetic and biochemical reasons 33 , it seemed more favourable to consider that clathrin polymerizes directly into its ﬁnal curved shape . However , explaining the various shape of clathrin coats has for long been a matter of debate : it was proposed 12 and analysed theoretically 26 , 34 how the clathrin lattice could be reorganized to change shape once polymerized . Another possibility is that the clathrin coat is soft enough once polymerized to deform elastically under increasing tension . However , measurement of the clathrin - coated membrane bending rigidity showed it is about 10 times more than free lipid membranes , which accounts for less than 5 % change in size by elastic deformation ( theory not shown ) . Moreover , our model and ﬁndings favour the direct polymerization of clathrin in a curved lattice with AP180 . They also account for how the shape of the bud could be modulated by membrane tension . Our ﬁndings are compatible with the fact that partial knockdown of clathrin generates shallow pits in vivo 35 , as our model predicts a decrease in clathrin’s cytosolic concentration would result in a lowering of its polymerization energy m . Similar shallow coats were also observed with both H 6 - D ANTH - AP180 and full - length H 6 - AP180 , together with clathrin in a recent reconstitution study suggesting that clathrin polymerization alone could drive membrane bending 13 . The polymerization of other membrane coats has also been shown to depend on tension . Such examples include the shape of Coat Proteins I ( COPI ) coats that change from ﬂat to a budded state when tension is decreased 36 , and caveolae that can be disrupted by increased membrane tension 28 . More generally , actin plays a critical role in the clathrin bud formation , in all cell types that have been studied , from yeast 37 to mammals 28 , 29 . Actin is the main membrane tension regulator in eukaryotic cells . Its role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis thus may indicate that membrane tension is a general regulator of clathrin - mediated endocytosis .

Fluorescent lipid bodipy - tetra - methyl - rhodamine - PIP 2 ( TMR - PIP 2 ) were purchased from Echelon Bios - ciences . Two lipid compositions were used— ( 1 ) 25 % DOPC þ 30 % DOPE þ 5 % liver PI þ 30 % DOPS þ 10 % PIP 2 supplemented with 15 % cholesterol and 1 % TMR - PIP 2 ; ( 2 ) 60 % BSM þ 30 % DOPS þ 10 % PIP 2 þ 1 % TMR - PIP 2 supplemented with 50 % cholesterol . streptavidin - coated polystyrene beads ( 3 . 05 m m ) used for nanotube pulling experiments were purchased from Spherotech . Clathrin was extracted from fresh porcine brains and puriﬁed as described in ref . 15 . Clathrin was labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide ( Invitrogen ) . AP180 was expressed in BL21 / DH3 a cells and puriﬁed by glutathione S transferase pull - down and glutathione S transferase cleaved by PreScission protease . AP180 was labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide ( Invitrogen ) . Epsin was puriﬁed from cells infected with baculovirus as described in ref . 5 and labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide ( Invitrogen ) . All proteins were aliquoted in GTPase buffer ( HEPES 20m M pH ¼ 7 . 4 , NaCl 100m M and MgCl 2 1m M ) and stored at (cid:2) 80 (cid:2) C . Preparation of GUVs . The GUVs were composed of 25 % DOPC , 30 % DOPE , 5 % liver PI , 30 % DOPS , 10 % PIP 2 , 15 % cholesterol and 1 % TMR - PIP 2 ( ﬂuorescent lipid ) in chloroform / methanol at a concentration of 2mgml (cid:2) 1 . The lipid mix was dried under N 2 ﬂux and further dried under vacuum for 1h before being resuspended in pure chloroform . To obtain a good yield of GUVs containing highly negatively charged lipids , the electroformation of GUVs was performed as described in ref . 21 . Brieﬂy , a uniform smear of 10 m l of lipid mix at 2mgml (cid:2) 1 was ﬁrst dried on conductive indium - tin oxide - coated glass ( Pra¨zisions Glas and Optik GmbH ) for 30min at 60 (cid:2) C , followed by drying under vacuum for at least 1h . The lipid ﬁlm was then rehydrated in a sucrose solution at 208 ± 1mOsm and GUVs were allowed to grow for 1h under a sine voltage ( 900mV , 10Hz ) . For iso - osmotic experimental conditions , a sucrose solution of equal osmolarity as the protein solution was used , while for hypertonic and hypotonic conditions , more concentrated or less concentrated ( respectively ) sucrose solutions were used .

All rights reserved . Confocal microscopy . An open homemade observation chamber was incubated with a 2mgml (cid:2) 1 casein solution for 15min to avoid adhesion of GUVs to the coverslip . The chamber was then rinsed twice with GTPase buffer ( see above ) before injecting 180 m l of the same buffer containing the proteins . The ﬁnal con - centrations of AP180 and clathrin were 0 . 5 and 0 . 4 m M , respectively . The protein mix was allowed to equilibrate in the chamber , followed by injection of 4 – 5 m l of GUVs . Imaging was carried out on a Nikon confocal microscope . Identical laser power and gain settings were used during the course of all experiments . Electron microscopy . An excess of GUVs in different osmotic environments was incubated with protein mix and visualized by confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy for binding of AP180 / clathrin . The protein - bound GUVs were ﬁxed with 4 % glutar - aldehyde , embedded in 2 % agar to increase the sedimentation of the liposomes and spun for 5 , 000r . p . m . for 3 – 4min to pellet down the sample . The sample was treated with 0 . 4 M Millonig’s buffer ( sodium phosphate ( monobasic ) þ NaOH ) containing 2 % osmium tetroxide for 1h and rinsed with ddH 2 O . The sample was stained with 0 . 25 % uranyl acetate overnight and rinsed with ddH 2 O followed by sequential dehydration in 30 , 50 , 70 and 90 % ethanol for 5 – 10min . The last dehydration step was carried out three times in absolute ethanol for 30min each . The sample was then washed with propylene oxide twice for 10min followed by incubation in epon - propylene oxide ( 1 : 1 ) for 1h . Finally , the sample was treated with 100 % epon overnight at room temperature before being embedded in 1ml of epon resin mix followed by curing at 65 (cid:2) C for at least 24h . Ultrathin sectioning was performed using a microtome ( Leica Ultracut ) at a cutting angle of 6 (cid:2) . Sections were put on glow - discharged carbon - coated formvar grids and viewed with a Tecnai G2 Sphera ( FEI ) electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 160kV and an exposure time of 1 , 000ms . Also , for negative - stain EM observations , LUVs were ﬁrst incubated with AP180 / clathrin in suspension for 10 – 15min and then adsorbed onto Formvar - coated EM grids . The samples were ﬁxed and negatively stained with 2 % uranyl acetate before visualization . Clathrin polymerization energy measurements . GUVs were aspirated in a micropipette controlled by a motorized micromanipulator ( Sutter MP225 ) and a custom - made hydraulic system to control the aspiration pressure D P and to set the membrane tension : s ¼ 12 R p D P 1 (cid:2) R p R v where R p and R v are the radii of the pipette and GUV , respectively . A membrane nanotube was pulled out of a GUV whose membrane was attached to a streptavidin - coated bead ( 3 . 05 m m diameter , Spher - otec ) held in a ﬁxed optical trap . The optical trap was custom - made with an ytterbium ﬁbre laser focused through a 100 (cid:3) 1 . 3 numerical apperture oil immersion objective . The force F exerted on the bead was calculated from the Hooke’s law : F ¼ k * D x , where k is the stiffness of the trap ( k ¼ 360pN m m (cid:2) 1 W (cid:2) 1 ) calibrated by the viscous drag method 38 and D x the displacement of the bead from its equilibrium position in the optical trap measured with a custom - made video tracking software . AP180 and clathrin were injected close to the nanotube using a second micropipette with a typical radius of 10 m m controlled with a hydraulic micromanipulator ( Narishige ) . Nanotubes were visualized simultaneously by brightﬁeld imaging ( Pixelink camera ) and by dual - colour confocal microscopy ( l 1 ¼ 488nm and l 2 ¼ 543nm ) on an inverted Nikon eclipse Ti microscope . The clathrin polymerization energy was measured for increasing values of set membrane tensions . Image analysis . Images were analysed and processed with ImageJ . The ﬂuorescence signal , F vesicle along the equatorial plane of GUVs was quantiﬁed by measuring the average ﬂuorescence of the membrane using the OvalProﬁle plugin of ImageJ . The background ﬂuorescence of the unbound protein , F background was measured in an area close to the vesicle . Fluorescence intensity of the vesicle was denoted as I ¼ ( F vesicle (cid:2) F background ) . Same illumination and detection settings were used for all the experimental conditions . Electron micrographs were manually analysed using ImageJ to measure the average bud diameter of 65 ± 5nm under hypertonic conditions . Atomic force microscopy on supported bilayer . Ten m l of a 10 - mgml (cid:2) 1 lipid mixture was dropped onto a circular glass coverslip , air dried and kept under vacuum for at least 1h . The dried lipid smear was hydrated with 90 m l of GTPase buffer for 30min , followed by rinsing to peel off the membrane regions that did not adhere to the surface . Two m l of the protein mix ( AP180 þ clathrin ) was incubated with the adhered membrane sheet for 30min , followed by rinsing with GTPase buffer to wash the unbound protein . The protein - binding membrane sheet was then ﬁxed with 4 % glutaraldehyde and 1 . 8 % osmium tetroxide for 1h , followed by washes with GTPase buffer . The sample was then dehydrated by series of ethanol washes ( 30 % , 50 % , 70 % and 90 % ethanol for 5min each ) and further kept overnight under absolute ethanol . The dried sample was then imaged using the Multimode V AFM ( Veeco ) in tapping mode . Pointprobe Plus tips ( Nanosensors , Neuchatel , Switzerland ) with non - contact high frequency ( C ¼ 42N . m (cid:2) 1 , f o ¼ 330kHz ) were used for scanning the image . References 1 .
