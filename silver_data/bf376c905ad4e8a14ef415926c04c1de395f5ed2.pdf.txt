It is known that amastigotes derived from trypomastigotes in the extracellular milieu are infective in vitro and in vivo . Extracellular amastigotes ( EAs ) have a stage - speciﬁc surface antigen called Ssp - 4 , a GPI - anchored glycoprotein that is secreted by the parasites . By immunoprecipitation with the Ssp - 4 - speciﬁc monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) 2C2 and 1D9 , we isolated the glycoprotein from EAs . By mass spectrometry , we identiﬁed the core protein of Ssp - 4 and evaluated mRNA expression and the presence of Ssp - 4 carbohydrate epitopes recognized by mAb1D9 . We demonstrated that the carbohydrate epitope recognized by mAb1D9 could promote host cell invasion by EAs . Although infectious EAs express lower amounts of Ssp - 4 compared with less - infectious EAs ( at the mRNA and protein levels ) , it is the glycosylation of Ssp - 4 ( identiﬁed by mAb1D9 staining only in infectious strains and recognized by galectin - 3 on host cells ) that is the determinant of EA invasion of host cells . Furthermore , Ssp - 4 is secreted by EAs , either free or associated with parasite vesicles , and can participate in host - cell interactions . The results presented here describe the possible role of a carbohydrate moiety of T . cruzi surface glycoproteins in host cell invasion by EA forms , highlighting the potential of these moieties as therapeutic and vaccine targets for the treatment of Chagas’ disease . Keywords : Trypanosoma cruzi , extracellular amastigotes , Ssp - 4 glycoprotein , galectin - 3 INTRODUCTION The ﬂagellated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of Chagas’ disease and is responsible for an estimated 6 – 7 million individuals infected worldwide , mostly in Latin America ( World Health Organization [ WHO ] , 2017 ) . This parasite has four deﬁned morphological stages : two infective forms called metacyclic and bloodstream trypomastigotes and two replicative forms Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 1 April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 693 fmicb - 09 - 00693 April 10 , 2018 Time : 12 : 21 # 2 Florentino et al . Glycosylated Ssp - 4 Participates in T . cruzi Infection known as amastigotes and epimastigotes ( Clayton , 2010 ) . Although T . cruzi amastigotes are usually found in the cytoplasm of infected cells of the mammalian host , these forms can also be found in the extracellular milieu due to trypomastigote diﬀerentiation or early lysis of infected cells ( Andrews et al . , 1987 ; Ley et al . , 1988 ) or due to cytolysis at inﬂamed sites of infection during the chronic stage of Chagas’ disease ( Scharfstein and Morrot , 1999 ) . These extracellular amastigotes ( EAs ) are proxies for their intracellular counterparts as they share morphological and immunochemical markers and are capable of invading and sustaining infection cycles in mammalian cells ( Nogueira and Cohn , 1976 ; Ley et al . , 1988 ) . However , unlike the infective trypomastigote forms , EAs invade HeLa cells in an actin - dependent mechanism , forming a phagocytic cup that surrounds these parasites ( Mortara , 1991 ; Procópio et al . , 1999 ) , suggesting that EAs display functionally distinct membrane proteins that interact with a diﬀerent set of host cell receptors . The membrane proteins on the surfaces of EAs are recognized by host cell receptors , and the roles of these proteins in actin - dependent invasion remain elusive . Kahn et al . ( 1996 ) have observed that amastigotes , but not trypomastigotes or epimastigotes , interact with host macrophages via mannose surface receptors ( MRIs ) . The cell surface protein galectin - 3 ( Gal - 3 ) , which belongs to the galectin family and recognizes β - galactosides , has been previously implicated in the interaction of T . cruzi with host cell membranes ( Moody et al . , 2000 ; Kleshchenko et al . , 2004 ; Vray et al . , 2004 ; Pineda et al . , 2015 ) . In addition , Machado et al . ( 2014 ) observed the recruitment of galectin - 3 at invasion sites of EAs in macrophage cells . The EAs from group I strains ( such as the G strain ) were found to enter mammalian cells much more eﬃciently than parasites from groups II ( Y strain ) or VI ( CL strain ) ( Fernandes and Mortara , 2004 ; Mortara et al . , 2005 ; da Silva et al . , 2006 ; Fernandes et al . , 2007 ) . Diﬀerent studies have shown that the expression of protein and carbohydrate epitopes varies between T . cruzi strains and that these variations are correlated with parasite infectivity ( Mortara et al . , 1988 , 1992 ; Verbisck et al . , 1998 ; da Silva et al . , 2006 ; Yoshida , 2006 ) . We have previously observed two secreted proteins from EAs , p21 and mevalonate kinase , that mediate host cell signaling during invasion ( da Silva et al . , 2009 ; Ferreira et al . , 2016 ) . EAs also express on their surfaces a major glycoprotein , stage - speciﬁc protein 4 ( Ssp - 4 ) , initially described by Andrews et al . ( 1987 ) . This protein is gradually released into extracellular milieu , which is mediated by an endogenous phosphatidylinositol - speciﬁc phospholipase C ( PI - PLC ) ( Andrews et al . , 1988 ) . We have demonstrated that Ssp - 4 was also released in membrane trails when EAs were attached to poly - L - lysine - coated glass ( Barros et al . , 1996 ) . Two monoclonal antibodies detect diﬀerent epitopes of Ssp - 4 , mAb2C2 ( Andrews et al . , 1987 ) and mAb1D9 , this last one recognizes a carbohydrate epitope ( Barros et al . , 1997 ) . Moreover , highly infective EAs from the G strain showed reduced parasite invasion when incubated with mAb1D9 ( da Silva et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting the involvement of Ssp - 4 in host cell invasion . Although limited in their ability to mimic intracellular amastigotes , EAs present the same set of stage - speciﬁc surface antigens as Ssp - 4 ( Andrews et al . , 1987 ) , the structural and functional features of which are not yet fully understood . In the present report , we have revealed the Ssp - 4 protein sequence and observed a correlation between the expression of protein and carbohydrate epitopes and the strain infectivity proﬁle . Our ﬁndings suggest that parasite infectivity correlates with posttranslational modiﬁcations in Ssp - 4 , resulting in the expression of distinct carbohydrate epitopes on EA surfaces . We also demonstrated that the highly infective G strain secretes an Ssp - 4 epitope ( recognized by mAb1D9 ) into vesicle trails adhered to HeLa cells , which may contribute to galectin - 3 recruitment during host cell invasion by EAs . RESULTS Ssp - 4 Glycosylation Is Associated With Host Cell Invasion by T . cruzi EAs Host cell invasion is a property exhibited by EAs of some by T . cruzi strains maintained in vitro . First , we conﬁrmed that the parasite strains G and CL can be categorized as infectious and less - infectious EA strains , respectively , based on HeLa cell invasion assays . Figure 1A shows that the number of internalized parasites from the G strain within HeLa cells is two logs higher ( p < 0 . 001 ) than the number from the CL strain , allowing us to classify these strains as infectious and less infectious , respectively . Next , the expression of Ssp - 4 on the surfaces of infectious and less infectious EAs was assessed by immunoﬂuorescence using two monoclonal antibodies speciﬁc for the Ssp - 4 antigen , namely , mAb2C2 and mAb1D9 , the latter being employed to identify carbohydrate epitopes associated with Ssp - 4 ( Barros et al . , 1997 ) . The carbohydrate epitope recognized by mAb1D9 is highly expressed in infectious EAs and is absent in less infectious EAs ; conversely , mAb2C2 only recognizes Ssp - 4 on the surfaces of less infectious strains ( Figure 1B ) . This result was reproduced in EA lysates immunostained with mAb1D9 and mAb2C2 by Western blotting ( Figure 1C ) : while the carbohydrate epitope recognized by mAb1D9 is completely absent in the less - infectious CL strain , the epitope recognized by mAb2C2 is detected in both strains , although this recognition is weak in EAs of the infectious G strain ( Figure 1C , arrow ) . The inverse correlation between the detection of the Ssp - 4 carbohydrate epitope by mAb1D9 and the infectivity of EAs was investigated using other T . cruzi strains . Figures 2A , B show the membrane distribution and expression of Ssp - 4 epitopes ( detected by mAb2C2 and mAb1D9 by immunoﬂuorescence and Western blotting , respectively ) in T cruzi strains Tc863 ( Tc III ) , Tc1522 ( Tc I ) , and Tc1994 ( TcBat ) compared with the infectious G strain ( Tc I ) . Highly infective EAs from the G and Tc1522 strains presented higher reactivity to mAb1D9 and lower reactivity to mAb2C2 ( Figures 2B , C ) . Conversely , Tc863 exhibited low infectivity and lacked the carbohydrate epitope recognized by mAb1D9 ; however , this strain exhibited strong reactivity to mAb2C2 . Tc1994 ( TcBat ) showed intermediate Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 2 April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 693 fmicb - 09 - 00693 April 10 , 2018 Time : 12 : 21 # 3 Florentino et al .

Ssp - 4 Expression Does Not Correlate With EA Infectivity As we have established that the presence of the Ssp - 4 carbohydrate epitope recognized by mAb1D9 correlates with EA infectivity , we sought to identify the Ssp - 4 sequence and evaluate whether the mRNA and protein expression of Ssp - 4 is also correlated with host cell invasion . We employed an immunoprecipitation assay on lysates of less - infectious EAs by using either mAb2C2 or control serum and speciﬁcally detected a band of 93 kDa associated with Ssp - 4 ( Figure 3A ) . Western blotting with mAb2C2 conﬁrmed the presence of a band corresponding to a 93 - kDa protein in the mAb2C2 immunoprecipitates that is absent when immunoprecipitation is performed using control serum ( red arrows in Figure 3A ) . Immunoprecipitation of G strain lysates using mAb1D9 and mAb2C2 also detected a band of 93 kDa , which was detected with mAb1D9 . Consistent with this result , IPs from the control serum were not recognized by mAb2C2 or mAb1D9 ( Figure 3B ) . The 93 kDa bands were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis followed by a database search using the T . cruzi CL Brener ( hybrid clone ) genome database ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . The mAb2C2 immunoprecipitates from the CL strain showed high identity with sequences from two CL Brener haplotypes , namely , TcCLB . 507089 . 170 ( Esmeraldo - like haplotype ) and TcCLB . 506725 . 20 ( non - Esmeraldo - like haplotype ) , with 16 % coverage . Both sequences code for the same 67 kDa hypothetical protein . Interestingly , mass spectrometric analysis of the 93 kDa band from the immunoprecipitation of the G strain with mAb2C2 and mAb1D9 also identiﬁed the same protein ( TcCLB . 506725 . 20 ) with 19 . 6 and 17 . 2 % coverage , respectively ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . Proteins identiﬁed by mass spectrometry in the IP of the G strain are listed in Supplementary Table S2 ; TcCLB . 506725 . 20 had the highest score among the proteins . In silico analysis predicted an N - terminal signal peptide with high probability , indicating that this protein is secreted ( Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure S1 ) .

Although this protein does not have a classic glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchor domain , a highly hydrophobic C - terminal domain of approximately 20 amino acids is predicted , and without this terminal domain , Ssp - 4 has 100 % probability of being anchored to GPI . The immunogenic peptides of the predicted protein were assessed by prediction of the tertiary structure of the protein using homology modeling and threading by two diﬀerent algorithms ( I - Tasser and Yasara ) ( Figure 3D ) . In these models , the peptides with higher immunogenic potential from the protein are displayed in diﬀerent colors ( blue , green , red , and yellow ) . From the structural analysis , peptides LREFVRSTERNR ( named MAP2 , shown in yellow ) and EARDQQALTQLR ( shown in green ) predicted to be more exposed on the protein surface compared to peptides LNWGADAKEMYTEYR ( shown in blue ) and VGENFDDSWASDLRR ( shown in red ) ( Supplementary Table S3 ) . Only MAP2 was selected for polyclonal antibody production in mice . The polyclonal antibody against the MAP2 peptide reacted with a band of 93 kDa from EA lysates immunoprecipitated with mAb2C2 ( Figure 3E ) , conﬁrming that the MAP2 peptide is part of the protein core of Ssp - 4 . These data conﬁrm that the hypothetical protein identiﬁed by mass spectrometry is Ssp - 4 , as previously identiﬁed by mAb2C2 ( Andrews et al . , 1988 ) . We sequenced nucleotides from the T . cruzi CL Brener , G and CL strains , and the protein alignment revealed that the Ssp - 4 sequence is well conserved across all strains and among CL Brener haplotypes , clone Dm28c , and the Sylvio strain from the genome database ( Supplementary Figure S2A ) . Protein identity between all strains was analyzed and was found to be at least 95 . 7 % ( Supplementary Figure S2B ) . The identiﬁed Ssp - 4 sequence allowed us to compare the mRNA expression of Ssp - 4 in infectious and less - infectious EA strains ; we observed that Ssp - 4 mRNA expression , measured Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 4 April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 693 fmicb - 09 - 00693 April 10 , 2018 Time : 12 : 21 # 5 Florentino et al .

This diﬀerence was conﬁrmed by Western blotting and immunoﬂuorescence with a MAP2 antibody ( Figures 4B , C ) . Therefore , the invasiveness of infectious strains is not associated with Ssp - 4 mRNA or protein expression .

EAs Secrete Glycosylated Ssp - 4 That May or May Not Be Associated With Vesicles Because in silico analysis identiﬁed a signal peptide on the Ssp - 4 protein core ( Figure 3C and Supplementary Figures S1 , S2 ) , we assessed the secretion of the glycosylated form of Ssp - 4 ( detected by mAb1D9 ) using confocal and electron microscopy and SDS – PAGE / silver staining on EA supernatant fractions . First , morphological analysis of the microscopy images revealed that infectious EAs release vesicles to the extracellular medium , and these vesicles are either attached to poly - L - lysine - coated substrates or to host cell surfaces ( Figures 5A , B ) . Vesicles of regular shape ( 100 – 200 nm in diameter ) are secreted in trails ( Figures 5A , B , arrows ) . These vesicle trails display the carbohydrate epitope recognized by mAb1D9 and are shed locally at sites of close contact between EAs and host cells , characterized by phagocytic cups formed by host cell actin ( Figure 5C and Supplementary Figure S3 ) . These phagocytic cups associated with the interactions of infectious EAs are also rich in galectin - 3 ( Gal - 3 ) ; Figure 6A shows that the actin of the phagocytic cup and Gal - 3 colocalize in regions of interaction between host cells and infectious EAs tagged with mAb1D9 . The host cell origin of Gal - 3 was conﬁrmed by Western blotting on extracts of host cells or EAs alone and of host cells interacting with EAs ( Figure 6B ) . Additionally , host cells infected by EAs present 20 % more Gal - 3 than non - infected host cells ( Figure 6B ) . The direct interaction between the Ssp - 4 carbohydrate epitope recognized by mAb1D9 and host cell Gal - 3 was assessed by immunoprecipitation using anti - Gal - 3 ; Figure 6C shows that only the lysates of infected host cells presented reactivity with mAb1D9 ( red arrow ) , indicating that the carbohydrate epitope recognized by mAb1D9 and displayed on Ssp - 4 is a β - galactoside , with which Gal - 3 is known to speciﬁcally interact ( Hughes , 1999 ) .

( D ) Extracellular amastigotes ( EAs ) from the G and Y strains were incubated for 6 h in RPMI medium without fetal bovine serum . Supernatant was collected and fractionated in three different populations : V2 ( pelleted after 2 h of ultracentrifugation ) , V16 ( pelleted after 16 h ultracentrifugation ) , and VF ( supernatant from pellet V16 ) . Western blotting with mAb1D9 and silver - stained SDS – PAGE of the different fractions . Whole cell ( WC ) lysate of EAs of the G strain was used as control . components and is secreted in vesicles during interactions with host cells at sites of EA invasion , we evaluated whether glycosylated Ssp - 4 could also be found in vesicle - free fractions of infectious EA supernatants ( Figure 5D ) . Fractions were obtained by ultracentrifugation of the EA supernatant after 2 or 16 h , resulting in precipitates containing ectosomes ( V2 fraction ) and exosomes ( V16 fraction ) , respectively . The remaining supernatant is considered free of vesicles ( VF fraction ) . Figure 5D shows that although SDS – PAGE / silver staining demonstrated diﬀerent protein proﬁles between supernatant populations , glycosylated Ssp - 4 was detected by mAb1D9 in all three fractions , demonstrating that infectious EAs release either free glycosylated Ssp - 4 or glycosylated Ssp - 4 in association with diﬀerent secreted vesicles . No diﬀerences in electrophoretic mobility were observed between vesicle - free and vesicle - associated Ssp - 4 protein . This ﬁnding is consistent with previous observations about the T . cruzi secretome from metacyclic typomastigotes , where the stage - speciﬁc GPI - anchored protein GP82 detected in vesicle - free fractions had a mobility proﬁle that matched that of the protein present in vesicle - enriched fractions ( Bayer - Santos et al . , 2013 ) .

Red arrow indicates the band that reacted with mAb1D9 on the IP H + G . DISCUSSION Mortara et al . ( 1999 ) ﬁrst established correlation between Ssp - 4 recognition by mAb1D9 and EA infectivity by demonstrating that EAs of more infective strains present higher reactivity with mAb1D9 . However , da Silva et al . ( 2006 ) did not observe the same correlation between mAb1D9 reactivity and EA infectivity in isolates from chagasic patients . Although correlation was not demonstrated , the authors veriﬁed that blockage of the carbohydrate epitope with mAb1D9 could inhibit EA invasion , suggesting a role for carbohydrate moieties of Ssp - 4 in host cell invasion . We conﬁrmed the correlation between the Ssp - 4 carbohydrate epitope recognized by mAb1D9 and EA infectivity , adding these observations to those from the sequencing of the Ssp - 4 protein core , the measurement of the expression of this protein in infectious versus less - infectious EAs and the analysis of the nature and function of the carbohydrate moieties in parasite infectivity . The EAs from the most infective strains , G and clone Tc1552 , which belong to the same phylogenetic group ( Tc I ) , exhibited high reactivity with mAb1D9 and low reactivity with mAb2C2 ( Figures 1 , 2 ) . Conversely , less - infectious EAs , such as those of the CL strain ( Tc VI ) and the Tc863 isolate ( Tc III ) , showed high reactivity with mAb2C2 and low reactivity with mAb1D9 .

Glycosylated Ssp - 4 Participates in T . cruzi Infection results suggest that the post - translational modiﬁcations of Ssp - 4 diﬀer among T . cruzi strains , and this phenotype directly reﬂects parasite infectivity . The ﬁrst description of Ssp - 4 revealed that mAb2C2 recognizes a surface GPI - anchored glycoprotein , which is cleaved and released into extracellular milieu in the presence of PI - PLC ( Andrews et al . , 1988 ) . Subsequently , Olivas - Rubio et al . ( 2009 ) identiﬁed a partial sequence from the DGF - 1 multigenic family , but identiﬁcation of potential domains on the putative protein was challenging . These challenges led us to identify Ssp - 4 using approaches other than immunostaining , such as mass spectrometry ( MS ) of mAb2C2 - and mAb1D9 - immunoprecipitated proteins , protein sequencing with bioinformatic analysis and quantitative PCR . Based on the CL Brener hybrid clone genomic database , haplotype sequences encode a hypothetical protein that is highly expressed ( mRNA and protein ) in amastigote forms ( Atwood et al . , 2005 ; Minning et al . , 2009 ) . Additionally , Ssp - 4 sequences exhibit homology with a hypothetical protein from Trypanosoma rangeli and Leishmania ssp . , but not Trypanosoma brucei , which indicates that these proteins could be associated with the presence of an intracellular cycle deﬁned by the amastigote form . In silico analysis of the amino acid sequences identiﬁed by MS led to the identiﬁcation of Ssp - 4 domains previously described by Andrews et al . ( 1988 ) as potential sites to be targeted to the plasma membrane and secreted , i . e . , the presence of N - and O - glycosylation sites and a possible GPI - anchor . Potential glycosylation sites observed explain the fact that hypothetical protein encountered by MS present 67 kDa , and by Western blotting molecular weight detect a band between 93 kDa . Finally , an α / β - hydrolase motif was identiﬁed . Previous study found that the trypomastigote surface prolyl oligopeptidase ( POP ) enzyme ( Tc80 ) , which contains an α / β - hydrolase domain , is capable of hydrolyzing substrates such as ﬁbronectin and collagen and was shown to be involved in non - phagocytic cell invasion ( Bastos et al . , 2005 ) . However , the enzymatic functions of this feature of Ssp - 4 were not investigated , and the contribution of this enzyme to host cell invasion remains unclear . To conﬁrm our MS data , a polyclonal antibody ( MAP2 ) was produced based on the tertiary structure of Ssp - 4 ( Figure 3C ) . In this set of results , it was observed that MAP2 reacts with mAb2C2 immunoprecipitates ( mAb2C2 - IPs ) from less infectious EAs ( Figure 3E ) . These data strongly suggest that the protein detected by mass spectrometry is the Ssp - 4 that was previously described by Andrews et al . ( 1988 ) . Immunostaining using the MAP2 antibody detected higher expression of Ssp - 4 on non - infectious EAs , suggesting again that recognition of the carbohydrate epitope on Ssp - 4 by mAb1D9 can hinder the interactions of the protein core epitopes ( Figure 4B ) . The production of the MAP2 antibody , obtained after chemical synthesis of peptides generated by bioinformatics and protein modeling , conﬁrms the antigenic potential of Ssp - 4 and renders feasible the production of an eﬃcient and safe vaccine against Chagas’ disease using a combination of the Ssp - 4 protein core and carbohydrate moieties ( Quijano - Hernandez and Dumonteil , 2011 ; Ma et al . , 2015 ) . The hypothetical protein ( TcCLB . 506725 . 20 ) identiﬁed by MS and considered here to be Ssp - 4 was previously detected by our group in microarray assays . In the previous experiments , a 21 - kDa protein ( P21 ) and a mevalonate kinase ( MVK ) were also detected , being more highly expressed in the infectious EAs of the G strain than in the less - infectious CL strain ; these two factors were shown to contribute to host cell invasion ( da Silva et al . , 2009 ; Ferreira et al . , 2016 ) . Here , we conﬁrmed by quantitative PCR that Ssp - 4 is more highly expressed in less - infectious strains ( Figure 4A ) , although infectious EAs exhibit a highly glycosylated Ssp - 4 ( as revealed by mAb1D9 ) . Thus , we concluded that even though Ssp - 4 provides the substrate for other posttranslational modiﬁcations , host cell invasion is not determined by Ssp - 4 protein expression alone but by glycosylation of Ssp - 4 ( Figure 4 ) . Considering that glycosylated Ssp - 4 is secreted and that infectious EAs secrete large amounts of vesicle trails when adhered to poly - L - lysine surfaces covered by glycosylated Ssp - 4 or mammalian host cell surfaces ( Figures 5A , B ) ( Barros et al . , 1996 ) , we investigated whether or not Ssp - 4 interacted with these vesicles to modulate EA infection by either inhibiting or promoting host cell invasion . A recent study observed a similar pattern of secreted vesicles from ﬂagellar membranes of Trypanosoma brucei that act as carriers of virulence factors , contributing to host immune evasion and erythrocyte remodeling ( Szempruch et al . , 2016 ) . First , vesicles displaying glycosylated Ssp - 4 are secreted locally at sites of EA - host - cell interaction , namely , the phagocytic cup formed during the process of EA internalization , suggesting that these vesicles could be recognized by host cell receptors and could ultimately promote host cell invasion . Therefore , we sought to identify a possible receptor that could bind to carbohydrates displayed by Ssp - 4 . Several groups have demonstrated that Gal - 3 participates in host cell infection by T . cruzi ; Machado et al . ( 2014 ) observed the recruitment of Gal - 3 during invasion and after parasitic escape from vacuoles in peritoneal macrophages infected with EAs of the G strain . Considering that EAs are internalized by non - professional phagocytes via an actin - dependent process similar to phagocytosis ( Mortara , 1991 ; Procópio et al . , 1998 ; Fernandes et al . , 2013 ) and that Gal - 3 has been shown to play a crucial role during phagocytosis in macrophages ( Sano et al . , 2003 ) , we investigated the association of Gal - 3 with the Ssp - 4 carbohydrate epitope recognized by mAb1D9 during host cell invasion by EAs . We have demonstrated that Gal - 3 is recruited to the EA entry site ( Figure 6A ) , is more abundant in infected cells than in uninfected cells ( Figure 6B ) and co - immunoprecipitates with Ssp - 4 recognized by mAb1D9 ( Figure 6C ) . As Gal - 3 speciﬁcally recognizes β - galactosides , we concluded that a β - galactose antigen displayed by Ssp - 4 is the carbohydrate moiety recognized by host cells . Exogenous Gal - 3 is able to activate Rac - 1 in corneal epithelial cells ( Saravanan et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , our group has previously revealed the participation of proteins associated with the Rho - GTPase family , such as Rac - 1 , in EA internalization ( Fernandes and Mortara , 2004 ; Bonﬁm - Melo et al . , 2018 ) . Members of these families are responsible for mediating the recruitment of the actin cytoskeleton with cell surface receptors . Thus , increased Gal - 3 availability could mediate Rac - 1 activation and formation of phagocytic cups involved in host cell invasion of EAs .

Glycosylated Ssp - 4 Participates in T . cruzi Infection We have shown that post - translational modiﬁcations of surface proteins of T . cruzi EAs are more closely associated with parasite infectivity than the expression of the protein core . Additionally , glycosylated Ssp - 4 can form a bridge between the parasite and host cell surface factors such as Gal - 3 , triggering EA internalization . In our model , we have shown that protein glycosylation plays a central role in the control of EA host cell invasion , highlighting the importance of post - translational modiﬁcations . The results of this study may contribute to the development of therapeutic agents and vaccines for the treatment of Chagas’ disease . MATERIALS AND METHODS Host Cells HeLa cells and Vero cells ( Instituto Adolfo Lutz , São Paulo , Brazil ) were cultivated by successive passaging in RPMI 1640 medium ( Atena Biotecnologia ) supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Vitrocell ) , 100 U / mL penicillin and 100 µ g / mL streptomycin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Parasites In this study , parasites from the G ( Tc I ) ( Yoshida , 1983 ) and CL ( Tc VI ) strains ( Brener and Chiari , 1963 ) were used . New isolates of T . cruzi were also used : the Tc863 ( Tc III ) isolate and clones Tc1522 ( José strain ; Tc I ) and Tc1994 ( Tcbat ) . These previously classiﬁed / typed isolates were a gift from Dr . Marta M . Geraldes Teixeira ( ICB - USP , Trypanosomatid Bank ) . T . cruzi trypomastigote forms were collected from the supernatants of Vero cells cultivated with RPMI medium supplemented with 2 . 5 % heat - inactivated FBS . The trypomastigotes were then incubated with liver infusion tryptose ( Camargo , 1964 ) medium ( pH 5 . 8 ) supplemented with 10 % FBS for 16 h to obtain EAs ( Tomlinson et al . , 1995 ) . Ssp - 4 Antibodies Monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) 2C2 , which recognizes an epitope of Ssp - 4 , was a gift from Norma Andrews ( University of Maryland ) ( Andrews et al . , 1987 ) . The antibody mAb1D9 was obtained by immunization of BALB / c mice with amastigotes from clone D11 ( derived from G strain ) . Peptides ( Bio - Synthesis Inc . ) were synthesized based on the Ssp - 4 tertiary structure modeled by homology modeling and threading ( described in section “Molecular Modeling and Structural Analyses” ) . We selected non - conjugated multiple antigenic peptide sequence ( LREFVRSTERNR ) for animal immunization . Brieﬂy , solubilized peptides ( 1 mg / mL ) in phosphate - buﬀered saline ( PBS ; 137 mM NaCl , 10 mM phosphate , 2 . 7 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 ) were inoculated into BALB / c mice in the presence of Freund’s complete or incomplete adjuvant ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Four immunizations ( 100 µ L peptide solution / mouse ) were performed intraperitoneally with 7 - day interval . These mice were euthanized with lethal injections of ketamine / xylazine ( 250 / 50 mg / kg per mouse ) 1 week after the last immunization . Then , cardiac puncture was performed on these mice , and the collected blood was centrifuged at 1 , 200 × g for 5 min to obtain serum containing polyclonal antibodies ( MAP2 ) . Control serum was obtained as a negative control by caudal vein puncture before the ﬁrst immunization . All animal procedures were approved by the local ethics committee ( No . 1465020616 ) . Immunoprecipitation Ssp - 4 was immunoprecipitated ( IP ) using protein A - Sepharose ( Sigma - Aldrich ) with mAb2C2 ( IgG2a ) . Lysate was prepared from 10 9 EAs of the CL or G strains with lysis buﬀer ( 50 mM Tris – HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , pH 7 . 4 ) . The lysate was then incubated with protein A - Sepharose for 1 h at 4 ◦ C for pre - clearing . Next , the supernatant from the pre - clearing was incubated with protein A - Sepharose and mAb2C2 ( 1 : 5 , ascitic ﬂuid ) overnight at 4 ◦ C . After incubation , the pellet containing protein A - Sepharose attached to mAb2C2 and Ssp - 4 was washed with washing buﬀer ( 20 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 5 ) with diﬀerent NaCl concentrations ( 0 . 5 , 0 . 3 , 0 . 1 M ) . The pellet was then resuspended with 4 × SDS – PAGE sample buﬀer ( 0 . 1 M Tris – HCl , 10 % SDS , 0 . 5 mM bromophenol blue , 10 % glycerol , 12 % β - mercaptoethanol , pH 6 . 8 ) . As a control , we used a non - immune mouse serum for immunoprecipitation instead of mAb2C2 . Alternatively , immunoprecipitation was performed using EAs from the G strain lysate with mAb1D9 ( IgG3 ) and protein G - Sepharose ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Mass Spectrometric Analysis The IPs from the EAs of the CL strain with mAb2C2 and the control serum ( CS ) and IPs from the EAs of the G strain with mAb2C2 , mAb1D9 , and CS were subjected to SDS – PAGE and stained with colloidal Coomassie . The band of 93 kDa from all mAb2C2 and CS IPs were excised from the gel and destained with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 50 % acetonitrile ( ACN ) solution . Then , the bands were dehydrated with 100 % ACN . Proteins were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol and alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide . Gel bands were washed with 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 / 50 % ACN and then with 100 % ACN . The bands were then incubated with porcine trypsin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) solution ( 400 ng ) for 16 h at 37 ◦ C for protein digestion . The resulting peptides were resuspended in 0 . 1 % formic acid , and an aliquot ( 4 . 5 µ L ) was injected into a Q - TOF Ultima mass spectrometer ( Waters ) coupled to a nano - chromatography system ( nanoACQUITY , Waters ) . Samples were desalted and concentrated using a pre - column ( Symmetry C18 , 180 µ m × 20 mm , Waters ) and eluted onto a capillary reversed - phase C18 column ( 10 cm × 75 µ m , Waters ) at a ﬂow rate of 600 nL / min . Peptides were fractionated with a linear gradient from 5 to 40 % ACN in 0 . 1 % formic acid for 15 min . The eluted peptides were directly injected into the mass spectrometer ( MS ) via an electrospray . The MS spectrum of phosphoric acid was acquired simultaneously to acquisition of the sample spectra . The MS / MS spectra of the three most intense peaks with two to four charges in the MS function were automatically acquired in the data - dependent acquisition ( DDA ) mode . The capillary voltage and reference cone were set at 3 . 2 kV and 100 V , respectively . All analyses were performed in positive ion mode . The spectra were acquired from 50 to 2000 m / z .

Glycosylated Ssp - 4 Participates in T . cruzi Infection Peptides from the IPs of the G strain were injected onto an LTQ - Orbitrap Velos ( Thermo ) . Masses from the raw Q - TOF ﬁles were corrected using a lock mass of m / z 784 . 823 , and the raw data were converted to the . pkl format using the ProteinLynx Global Server ( Waters ) . Orbitrap raw ﬁles were converted into . mgf ﬁles using MSConverter . Searches were performed in MASCOT ( 2 . 4 . 1 version ) against a Trypanosoma cruzi CL Brener database ( downloaded in 2017 / 05 , 21 , 169 sequences ) by considering a peptide and fragment mass tolerance of 0 . 5 Da ( for Q - TOF ﬁles ) and peptide and fragment mass tolerance of 10 ppm and 0 . 6 Da , respectively . Carbamidomethylation of cysteine and oxidation of methionine residues were speciﬁed as ﬁxed and variable modiﬁcations , respectively . To obtain a ﬁnal list of identiﬁed proteins , masses smaller than 60 kDa and higher than 110 kDa were excluded as were proteins identiﬁed as control samples . Finally , proteins identiﬁed with scores lower than 80 were also excluded . In Silico Analysis Bioinformatics was performed using the ExPASy 1 platform . The signal peptide was predicted by SignalP v . 4 . 1 . The TargetP v . 1 . 1 platform was used to predict subcellular location . Hydrophobic domains were predicted by the TMHMM 2 . 0 server . Potential sites of N - and O - glycosylation were identiﬁed by NetNGlyc 1 . 0 and NetOGlyc 4 . 0 , respectively . Interproscan v . 4 . 8 software was used to identify diﬀerent protein domains . Prediction of GPI - anchoring sites was performed with the PredGPI 2 program . Cloning of the Ssp - 4 Coding Sequence The open reading frame encoding the putative Ssp - 4 protein identiﬁed by mass spectrometry was ampliﬁed by PCR using T . cruzi genomic DNA as a template . The ampliﬁcation was performed using the Ssp4F ( 5 (cid:48) - atggctctaaagagtatgcggaaa - 3 (cid:48) ) and Ssp4R ( 5 (cid:48) - ttaatggttcaaattgctgtaaaa - 3 (cid:48) ) oligonucleotides and Pfu DNA polymerase ( Fermentas ) . Amplicons from the G and CL strains and the CL Brener clone were resolved on agarose gels , and the bands at the expected size were excised and puriﬁed . Puriﬁed amplicons were A - tailed prior to ligation into the pGEM R (cid:13) - T Easy vector ( Promega ) . Plasmid DNA isolated from positive clones was sequenced on an ABI3500 genetic analyzer ( Applied Biosystems ) using the BigDye R (cid:13) Terminator v3 . 1 Cycle Sequencing Kit ( Life Technologies ) . Sequences were aligned by BioEdit v . 7 . 2 . 5 using the ClustalW algorithm . The assembled nucleotide sequences encoding the putative Ssp - 4 protein from the G and CL strains were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KX581696 and KX581697 , respectively . Relative Quantiﬁcation of mRNA by Real - Time PCR ( qPCR ) For real - time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) , we synthesized the following primers : GAPDH Forward ( 5 (cid:48) - agcgcgcgtctaagacttaca - 3 (cid:48) ) and Reverse ( 5 (cid:48) - tggagctgcggttgtcatt - 3 ) ( Cordero et al . , 2008 ) 1 www . expasy . org 2 http : / / gpcr . biocomp . unibo . it / predgpi / pred . htm and Ssp - 4 Forward ( 5 (cid:48) - cctctgacattgacccgttatt - 3 (cid:48) ) and Reverse ( 5 (cid:48) - gtaagttggattggtgtggta - 3 (cid:48) ) . RNA extraction from the EAs of the G and CL strains was performed with the RNeasy Protect Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) . Next , cDNA was generated using the High - Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . Relative quantiﬁcation was monitored by intercalation of SYBR TM Green Master Mix ( Life Technologies ) in the double - stranded DNA in qPCR reactions ; normalized values calculated with a (cid:49)(cid:49) cycle threshold ( Ct ) and relative expression ( 2 − (cid:49)(cid:49) C t ) with the G strain as a reference are shown . GAPDH is the housekeeping gene ; this gene is constitutively expressed in T . cruzi . Molecular Modeling and Structural Analyses The three - dimensional structure of the putative Ssp - 4 sequenced by mass spectrometry was modeled using I - Tasser ( Yang et al . , 2015 ) and Yasara 3 . The model with the highest C - score from I - Tasser and the hybrid model from Yasara were selected for structural analysis . The solvent - accessible surface area ( SASA ) of each amino acid was calculated using DSSP 2 . 2 . 1 ( Touw et al . , 2015 ) . The most exposed peptides in both models were selected as the most immunogenic peptides to be synthesized ( Bio - Synthesis Inc . ) for the production of the antibody against the Ssp - 4 protein region ( section “Ssp - 4 Antibodies” ) . Western Blotting The EA lysates ( 20 µ g ) were incubated with 4 × sample buﬀer and subjected to SDS – PAGE ( Laemmli , 1970 ) . Proteins from the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes to perform the immunoblotting ( Towbin et al . , 1979 ) . Membranes were blocked for 1 h with ECL blocking agent ( GE Healthcare ) , TBS ( 50 mM Tris – HCl , 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4 ) , and TBS - T ( TBS with 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ) . Then , nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with mAb1D9 ( 1 : 500 , ascites ) , mAb2C2 ( 1 : 500 ascites ) , MAP2 ( 1 : 500 , mouse antiserum ) , or anti - α - tubulin ( 1 : 1000 , Sigma - Aldrich ) overnight with 5 % bovine serum albumin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in TBS - T . Next , the membranes were incubated for 1 h with a secondary antibody , anti - mouse IgG - peroxidase ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and visualized by a chemiluminescence detector ( UVITEC ) in the presence of luminol with the ECL Prime Western blotting detection reagent ( GE Healthcare ) . Transmission and Scanning Electron Microscopy HeLa cells incubated with EAs for 30 min were ﬁxed with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde and 2 % formaldehyde in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buﬀer at room temperature for 1 h and then processed for transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) according to procedures described elsewhere ( Arruda et al . , 2012 ) . Cells were observed in a JEOL 1200 EXII electron microscope ( JEOL Ltd . , Peabody , MA , United States ) . For scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , EAs adhered to Vero cells or to coverslips covered with 0 . 1 % poly - L - lysine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde , washed with 0 . 1 M cacodylate solution , post - ﬁxed with osmium tetroxide , treated with tannic acid , dehydrated 3 www . yasara . org Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 11 April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 693 fmicb - 09 - 00693 April 10 , 2018 Time : 12 : 21 # 12 Florentino et al . Glycosylated Ssp - 4 Participates in T . cruzi Infection with ethanol , dried in a critical point dryer ( Bal - Tec AG , Balzers , Liechtenstein ) , and sputtered with gold . Samples were observed in an FEI Quanta FEG 250 SEM ( Hillsboro , OR , United States ) . Parasites Immunoﬂuorescence and Confocal Imaging The EAs were attached to coverslips covered with 0 . 1 % poly - L - lysine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 50 min or HeLa cells for 30 min at 37 ◦ C and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde . After ﬁxation , coverslips were incubated with blocking solution , PGN ( 0 . 2 % gelatin , 0 . 1 % NaN 3 , diluted in PBS ) , for 1 h . Next , samples were incubated with mAb1D9 , mAb2C2 ( 1 : 100 ) , or MAP2 ( 1 : 100 ) diluted in PGN supplemented with 0 . 25 % saponin ( PGN - S ; Sigma - Aldrich ) for 1 h at room temperature . Next , coverslips were incubated with a secondary antibody , Alexa Fluor 488 IgG - mouse ( Invitrogen ) , diluted in PGN - S ( 1 : 100 ) for 1 h at room temperature . Coverslips were then incubated with 1 µ M 4 (cid:48) , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) for 15 min . After three washes with PBS , coverslips were mounted in glycerol buﬀered with 0 . 1 M Tris ( pH 8 . 6 ) and 0 . 1 % p - phenylenediamine . Samples were examined by a Leica TCS SP5 confocal system ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) using a 100 × NA 1 : 44 oil immersion objective . Images were processed by Imaris software ( Bitplane AG , Andor Technology , Belfast , United Kingdom ) . EA Supernatant Fractionation The EAs supernatant fractionation was adapted from Bayer - Santos et al . ( 2013 ) . Brieﬂy , parasites from the G strain were incubated in RPMI medium without FBS for 6 h at 37 ◦ C ( 10 8 EAs / mL ) . Then , the parasites were removed by centrifugation at 3 , 000 × g for 10 min , and supernatant was collected . The supernatant was ﬁltered by using a 0 . 45 - µ m - pore membrane and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100 , 000 × g for 2 h to obtain the ﬁrst pellet , which was enriched with larger vesicles ( V2 ) . The supernatant resulting from this ultracentrifugation was again subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100 , 000 × g for 16 h to generate the second pellet , which was enriched with smaller vesicles ( V16 ) , and the supernatant contained vesicle - free soluble ( VF ) proteins . Infection of Host Cells Suspension containing 10 5 HeLa cells in RPMI supplemented with 10 % FBS per well ( 24 - well plate ) was plated on coverslips and incubated overnight at 37 ◦ C in CO 2 ( 5 % ) . Next , EAs ( Multiplicity of Infection ; MOI : 10 : 1 ) were added for 2 h at 37 ◦ C . After incubation , the cells were washed 5 – 7 times with PBS . Then , the cells were ﬁxed with Bouin’s solution ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 5 min and stained with Giemsa for 1 h ( da Silva et al . , 2006 ) . Internalized parasites were quantiﬁed by light microscopy ( Bonﬁm - Melo et al . , 2015 ) . Alternatively , EAs were added to HeLa cells adhered to 6 - well plates and incubated for 40 min at 37 ◦ C in CO 2 ( 5 % ) . An immunoﬂuorescence assay was performed on the coverslips ; after EA ( MOI 10 : 1 ) incubation , the cells were washed with PBS and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 15 min . Then , the coverslips were incubated with the primary antibodies mAb1D9 ( mouse IgG ) and anti - Galectin - 3 ( rat IgG ; a gift from Dr . Roger Chammas , Universidade de São Paulo ) for 1 h at room temperature . Next , the samples were incubated with the secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor IgG mouse 488 and Alexa Fluor IgG rat 568 in the presence of 1 µ m DAPI ( Invitrogen ) and 200 units / mL phalloidin 647 ( Invitrogen ) for 1 h at room temperature . For Western blotting , EAs ( MOI 40 : 1 ) were incubated with HeLa cells for 40 min at 37 ◦ C in CO 2 ( 5 % ) . Infected HeLa cells , control non - infected HeLa cells , and EA suspensions were lysed with lysis buﬀer ( 50 mM Tris – HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , pH 7 . 4 ) for 30 min at 4 ◦ C . Samples were subjected to Western blotting with primary antibodies anti - Gal - 3 ( 1 : 250 ) , mAb1D9 ( 1 : 500 ) , and anti - α - actin ( 1 : 1000 ; Cell Signaling ) , and then , immunoprecipitation with anti - Gal - 3 and protein G - Sepharose ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was performed as described above .
