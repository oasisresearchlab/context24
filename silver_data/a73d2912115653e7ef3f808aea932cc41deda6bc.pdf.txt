Inhibition of Neurite Initiation and Growth by Taxol PAUL C . LETOURNEAU and ALICE HARJU RESSLER Department of Anatomy , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 ABSTRACT (cid:9) We cultured sensory neurons from chick embryos in media containing the alkaloid taxol at concentrations from 7 X 10 - 9 to 3 . 5 X 10 - 6 M . When plated at taxol concentrations above 7 X 10 - 8 M for 24 h , neurons have short broad extensions that do not elongate on the culture substratum . Whèn actively growing neurites are exposed to these levels of taxol , neurite growth stops immediately and does not recommence . The broad processes of neurons cultured 24 h with taxol contain densely packed arrays of microtubules that loop back at the ends of the process . Neurofilaments are segregated from microtubules into bundles and tangled masses in these taxol - treated neurons . At the ends of neurites treated for 5 min with taxol , microtubules also turn and loop back abnormally toward the perikaryon . In the presence of 7 X 10 - 9 M taxol neurites do grow , although they are broader and less branched than normally . The neurites of these cells appear to have normal structure except for a large number of microtubules . Taxol probably stimulates microtubule polymerization in these cultured neurons . At high levels of the drug , this action inhibits neurite initiation and outgrowth by removing free tubulin from the cytoplasm and destroying the normal control of microtubule assembly in growing neurites . The rapid inhibition suggests that microtubule assembly may occur at neurite tips . At lower concentrations , taxol may slightly enhance the mechanisms of microtubule assembly in neurons , and this alteration of normal processes changes the morphogenetic properties of the growing neurites . Many cellular microtubules are in a dynamic equilibrium with unpolymerized tubulin and associated proteins ( 1 , 13 , 17 , 28 , 40 ) . Several drugs ( e . g . , colchicine ) bind to tubulin , and promote the disassembly ofthese microtubules ( 25 ) . This action has been used to probe the involvement of labile microtubules in several activities , including mitosis and cell motility ( 16 , 42 ) . Taxol , another plant alkaloid , binds to tubulin and lowers the critical concentration required for polymerization of purified tubulin ( 32 , 35 ) . The taxol - con - taining microtubules are resistant to cold temperature and concentrations of Ca " that normally depolymerize microtu - bules . Addition of taxol to cells induces unusual arrays of microtubules , and produces effects that include abnormal myofibrillogenesis and inhibition ofmitosis , cell proliferation , and cell migration ( 2 , 3 , 10 , 29 , 30 , 33 , 34 , 39 , 43 ) . Thus , it appears that promotion and stabilization ofmicrotubules can disrupt cell functions , just as microtubule depolymerization does . Microtubules have several roles in neurite outgrowth . Sen - sitivity to colchicine has implicated microtubules in the out - growth and stabilization of neurites , as well as in the normal suppression of filopodial activity along neurites , proximal to the growth cone ( 8 , 9 , 47 ) . Taxol has been applied to explants of mouse sensory ganglia , and unusual arrays of microtubules THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 98 APRIL 1984 1355 - 1362 0The Rockefeller University Press - 0021 - 9525 / 84 / 04 / 1355 / 08 $ 1 . 00 were reported in neuronal somas and neurites ( 29 ) . However , effects of taxol on neurite outgrowth were not mentioned in the paper . We have found that neurite outgrowth in vitro from sensory neurons of chick embryos is inhibited by taxol in a dose - dependent manner . At high concentrations neurite produc - tion is limited to short stout meganeurites . At the low concen - trations longer , thick neurites are formed , but they have abnormally few branches . Existing neurites cease growth im - mediately when exposed to high concentrations of taxol . Alteration in protrusive activityat neurite tips is alsoproduced by taxol . Neurons treated from beginning of culture with higher concentrations of taxol contain bundles of closely packed microtubules that exclude neurofilaments and other organelles . These findings indicate that an abnormal enhance - mentofmicrotubule assembly and stability disrupts the mech - anism of neurite elongation . We will discuss the relationships of these results to the dynamics of microtubules in growing neurites . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell CUltore : (cid:9) Dorsal root ganglia were dissected from 9 - 11 - d - old chick embryos and dissociated with crude trypsin ( 20 ) . Theresultant cell suspension was placed into aculture medium containing 40 % F12 nutrient mixture , 10 % 1355 calf serum , 50 % heart conditioned medium ( 24 ) and 10 ng / ml nerve growth factor ( a gift from Dr . Eric Shooter , Stanford University ) . 6 - 16 x 10 ' ganglion cells in 1 . 5 ml medium were put into 35 - mm plastic dishes treated in several ways : for measurements of neurite outgrowth and for preparing thin sections , cells were plated onto polylysine - treated tissue culture dishes ( Falcon 3001 , Falcon Labware , Oxnard , CA ) ; for immunocytochemistry , cells were plated onto 18 - mm polylysine - treated glass coverslips in petri dishes ( Falcon 1008 ) ; and for whole mount transmission electron microscopy , cells were plated onto 75 mesh gold electron microscope grids ( Ted Pella , Inc . Tustin , CA ) , supporting a polylysine - treated , carbon - coated Formar film ( 21 ) . For videomicroscopy , cells were plated into 50 - mm plastic dishes ( Falcon 1006 ) , containing a poly - lysine - treated coverslip glued ( Dow Coming Silicon cement [ Dow Corning Corp . , Midland , MI ] ) over a 22 - mm diameter hole . The dishes were incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5 % C02 incubator . Drug Treatments : (cid:9) Taxol ( obtained from the Natural Products Branch of the National Cancer Institute ) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at con - centrations from 0 . 002 - 2 . 0 mg / ml . The taxol solution was added to culture medium , so that the concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide did not exceed 0 . 3 % . Dimethyl sulfoxide alone at 0 . 3 % volume was added to the medium ofcontrol cultures . For study of recovery from taxol , dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) ' cells were rinsed three times with F12 nutrient mixture and recultured in whole culture medium . The need for protein synthesis during recoverywas examined by adding 10 rag / ml of cycloheximide ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) to culturemedium . Thisconcentration ofcycloheximideinhibits protein synthesis in DRG cells by 95 % ( 47 ) . Videomicroscopy : (cid:9) Motile behaviorofneurites was recorded from the Zeiss IM microscope using a Model 65 SIT camera ( Dage - MTI , Inc . , Michigan City , IN ) , anda Panasonic Model NV - 8030 timelapse videorecorder . Individual frames from a videotape were photographed from the videomonitor on Pan X film with a 35 mm SLR camera ( Canon AE - 1 ) . Extraction and Fixation : (cid:9) Cytoskeletons for immunocytochemistry and whole mount electron microscopy were prepared by incubation for 4 min in a bufferdescribed by Schfiwa and van Bleckom ( 36 ) , containing0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 . Actin filaments were preserved during extraction by the addition of either 5 Ag / ml phallacidin ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) or the Sl fragment of myosin ( agift from Dr . David Thomas , University ofMinnesota ) . The cytoskeletons were fixed for immunocytochemical localization of actin , neurofilament protein and tubulin by exposure to 4 % paraformaldehyde , 0 . 3 % glutaraldehyde in the extraction buffer for 30 min . For whole mount electron microscopy , the cytoskeletons were fixed 30 min with 2 % glutaraldehyde in extraction buffer , rinsed , and stainedwith 0 . 4 % tannic acid in water for 45 min ( 24 ) . For thin sections of unextracted neurons , cells were fixed with 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 154 M cacodylate , pH 7 . 4 , and postfixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide on ice for 7 min ( 24 ) . Immunocytochemistry : (cid:9) Rabbit antiserum to chicken gizzard actin was generously provided by Dr . Judith Schollmeyer of the Roman Hruska Meat Science Center ( 22 ) . A monoclonal antibody to the 210 , 000 - mol - wt neurofilament protein of rats was a gift from Dr . John M . Wood ofBurroughs - Wellcome ( 46 ) . Sheep antibodies to tubulin purified from bovine brain was purchased from Caab Co . ( Houston , TX ) . After fixatingand rinsing , the coverslipswere incubatedin 0 . 5 mg / ml sodium borohydride in Ca ' * - Mg + + free saline for 15 min . The primary antibodieswere applied in phosphate - buffered saline , containing 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 and 5 mg / ml bovine albumin ( SigmaChemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) . Actin antiserum was applied at I / 100 dilution , neurofilament antibody at I / 100 dilution ofascites fluid , and tubulin antibody at 66 ug / ml . Control coverslips were treated with actin antiserum preserved with actin or with a wash solution lacking a primary antiserum for tubulin and neurofilament protein localization . Coverslips were rinsed and stained with 1 / 100 dilutions of appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies purchased from Cappel Laboratories ( West Chester , PA ) . After a final rinse , coverslips were mounted on slides in Elvanol and viewed on a Zeiss IM microscope , with a 63X planapochromat objective illuminated by an HBO 100W lamp . Photography was done using Tri - X Pan film . Electron Microscopy : (cid:9) After tannic acid treatment the grids with cytoskeletonswere transferredto a grid holder , stainedwith aqueous2 % uranyl acetate for 30 min , dehydrated through a graded series ofethanol and critical point dried , and stabilized by deposition ofa thin layer ofcarbon . For preparation ofthin sections of unextracted neurons , the fixed cellswere stained with aqueous 2 % uranyl acetate , dehydrated through ethanol and embedded by addition of plastic resin to the tissue culture dishes . Blocks containing single cells were mounted on larger plastic bases and thin sections were cut parallel to the substratum . MeasurementS : (cid:9) Neurite outgrowth was measured after 24h culture . I Abbreviations used in this paper : DRG , dorsal root ganglion . 1356 (cid:9) THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 98 , 1984 DRG cells in polylysine - treated dishes were fixed with 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 154 M cacodylate , rinsed in phosphate - buffered saline , and stained with I osmium tetroxide on ice for 7 min . Percent of DRG neurons with neurites , mean neurite length and width , and number offilopodia per growth cone were calculated from counts of randomly selected microscopic fields representative of all areas ofthe culture substratum . Microtubule - Microtubule Separation : (cid:9) measurements ofmicro - tubule diameter and intermicrotubular distance were taken from electron micrograph negatives ( magnification of 70 , 000 ) using a IOX ocular positioned above an x - ray viewing box . Each observation was recorded when the following criteria were met : ( a ) microtubule diameter < 300 nm ; diameters greater than this were found to be adjacent microtubules intangential plane ; ( b ) intermicro - tubular distance may include organelles such as a mitochondrion or filaments , but was calculated as the total distance between two microtubules . Measure - ments were made only in the center of the negatives , where the microtubules could be followed for a greater length on the negative . Data were standardized against calibration negatives . RESULTS Effects of Taxol Concentration on Neurite Initiation and Growth Dissociated cells from dorsal root ganglia were cultured 24 h in media oontaining 3 . 5 x 10 - 6 - 7 x 10 - 9 M taxol ( Table I ) . The frequency of neurites was lowest at concentrations of taxol greater than 7 x 10 - a M and was limited to short , broad extensions , which we called meganeurites ( Fig . 1 b ; also see Fig 14 a ) . Several hours of videotapes showed that filopodia but not broader lamellipodia or veils were protruded along the meganeurites , but protrusive activity was not concentrated at the neurite tip to form a growth cone . In addition to protrusion of filopodia , movements of mitochondria and other particles were also visible in meganeurites . However , despite these two types of motility characteristic of growing neurites , meganeurites did not elongate during our videotap - ing . Neurons with short , broad meganeurites were still present after 5 d in Txol - containing medium . At the lowest concentration of taxol used in these experi - ments , 7 x 10 - 9 M , the frequency of neurite outgrowth approached normal levels ( Table I ) . These neurites were much less branched than control neurites and often ran hundreds of micrometers without one branch point ( compare Fig . 1 , a and c ) . The difference between untreated neurites and neurites formed in the presence of 7 x 10 - 9 M taxol was quantified in other ways . The mean width of neurites in a sample of 20 neurons from each situation was three times greater in the presence of7 x 10 - 9 M taxol ( 2 . 1 ± 0 . 6 pm vs . 0 . 7 ± 0 . 4 Am ) , and in the same sample the mean number of filopodia per growth cone ( 12 . 3 ± 5 vs . 7 . 7 ± 4 ) was also greater with 7 x 10 - 9 M taxol than for untreated cells .

LETOURNEAU AND RESSLER (cid:9) Taxol Inhibits Neurite Growth (cid:9) 135 7 roughly cylindrical , then neurites formed in 7 x 10 - 9 M taxol have a mean cross - sectional area approximately nine times greater than untreated neurites . On videotapes , the activity of neurites treated with the low concentration of taxol was generally similar to normal growth cone behavior , though the formation of lamellipodia and veil - like expansions of filopo - dia at the growth cones was less frequent . Ultrastructure of Taxol - treated Neurons As reported for studies of other cell types ( 2 , 10 , 29 , 30 , 33 , 34 , 39 , 43 ) , higher concentrations of taxol induce unusual arrays ofmicrotubules in DRG neurons . Microtubules circled the perikaryon in bundles and passed into the meganeurites ( Fig . 2 ) . At the distal ends ofmeganeurites , most microtubules looped back without terminating ( Fig . 3 ) , as occurs in un - treated neurites ( 24 ) . Along the meganeurites , microtubules were often closely packed into bundles or sheets ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) of microtubules separated by narrow regular spaces that eliminate other structures except for short fuzzy segments of material ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) . The mean intermicrotubule distance in taxol - treated meganeurites was significantly less ( 12 . 0 ± 10 . 6 nm , n = 200 ) than the mean distance between microtu - bules in control neurites ( 32 . 5 ± 31 . 7 nm , n = 155 ) . Another feature previously observed in taxol - treated cells was the close association of microtubules with narrow sacs or tubes of smooth endoplasmic reticulum ( Fig . 5 ) , compressed into nar - row spaces between the nearly parallel microtubules . Neurofilaments were excluded from the bundles of micro - tubules , and were frequently grouped into fascicles within meganeurites ( Fig . 5 ) . Occasionally , a knot of neurofilaments was present at the distal end ofa meganeurite . As in the arrays of microtubules , these neurofilament tangles , contained few other organelles except for some filamentous cross - bridges and small vesicles . It is interesting , then , that microtubules and neurofilaments , which are intermixed in untreated neu - rites were segregated in taxol - treated meganeurites into sepa - rate arrays . The ultrastructure ofneurites exposed to 7 x 10 - 9 M taxol was much more normal in that microtubules were separated by variable distances and were interspersed with other organ - elles along the length of neurites ( Figs . 6 and 7 ) . When studying whole mounted specimens , we were impressed by the large numbers of microtubules in the cytoskeletons of neurites exposed to 7 x 10 - 9 M taxol taxol ( Fig . 8 ) . This observation is consistent with the larger caliber of these neu - 1358 (cid:9) THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 98 , 1984 rites . These cytoskeletal preparations also showed that many microtubules ends were present at the neurite tips , as normally occurs ( 24 ) . Immunocytochemistry The distribution of three cytoskeletal proteins , tubulin , actin , and the 210 , 000 - mol - wt subunit of neurofilaments , in taxol - treated neurons was assessed by fluorescence immuno - cytochemistry . As expected , cells treated with 7 x 10 " ' M taxol contained large fluorescent masses ofbound antitubulin , that mimicked the distribution of microtubules ( Figs . 2 , 3 , and 10 ) . Antiactin was diffusely distributed along meganeu - rites with peripheral concentrations at sites of filopodia ( Fig . 11 ) , but no large accumulations at the tips of meganeurites , as at a growth cone ( 24 ) . The distribution of antibody to the 210 , 000 - mol - wt neurofilament subunit was generally similar to the distribution of tubulin ( Fig . 12 ) . Some cells contained bright immunofluorescence for the 210 , 000 - mol - wt protein at the tips of meganeurites , corresponding to the knots of neurofilaments at the ends of some meganeurites ( Fig . 5 ) . Cells stained with preabsorbed antibody to actin or without any primary antibody did not show the concentrations of staining observed with these cytoskeletal antibodies . Thus , each ofthe antibodies stains the meganeurites of taxol - treated cells in a manner consistent with the distribution ofmorpho - logically identifiable structures , and the bundles of microtu - bules do not contain these cytoskeletal proteins in unusual associations that could be related to the inhibition of neurite outgrowth by taxol . Effects of Taxol on Previously Formed Neurites Growth cones of DRG cells that had been cultured for 24 h in control medium were videotaped before and after the addition of taxol to a concentration of 7 x 10 - ' M . Within 90 s , as soon as the growth cone could be refocused after adding the drug , a response was evident ( Fig . 13 , a - c . ) . The neurite retracted for several micrometers and become broader at the tip . Protrusion offilopodia from the neurite tip contin - ued , but lamellipodia and veil - like expansions of filopodia were no longerproduced . These growth cones did not elongate further over 1 h of recording . The location of several neurites was marked on the dish , and after 24 h of further culture with taxol these neurites had not grown . In fact , some of the neurites had retracted their distal branches for 30 - 50 Am .

Microtubules are irregularly oriented along the neurite in the presence of 7 x 10 - 9 M taxol ( Fig . 6 ) , as in control neurites .

LETOURNEAU AND RESSLER (cid:9) Taxol Inhibits Neurite Growth (cid:9) 1359 Neurites that were cultured 24 h in regular medium and then treated with 7 x 10 - ' M taxol for 5 - 20 min were briefly extracted in detergent - containing buffer without taxol and examined by whole mount transmission electron microscopy . At the ends of these neurites microtubules were not longitu - dinally oriented as in untreated neuntes , rather the microtu - bules looped back or circled in a disordered group ( Fig . 9 ) . It did not appear that taxol had induced the formation , as occurs in preparations of purified tubulin ( 35 ) , ofmany short micro - tubules at the neurite tip . The actin filament network was noticably reduced at the tips ofthese neurites . This is probably related to the rapid reduction in protrusive activity when taxol is added . Recovery from Taxol Treatment It was of interest to ask whether the effects of taxol on neurite growth are readily reversible by removing the drug . Within 30 min of rinsing 7 x 10 ' M taxol from the culture medium , growth cones with many filopodia emerged from meganeurites and from the perikarya of neurons . This was reminiscent of the initiation of neurites from untreated neu - rons in the first hours of normal culture procedures . By 2 h after removing taxol , numerous cells had sprouted one or more actively growing neurites ( Fig . 14 ) . The need for protein synthesis during recovery was assessed by the addition ofthe inhibitor cycloheximide ( 47 ) . Exposure to 10 , ug / ml cyclohex - imide for up to 4 h before removal of taxol and continuing with cycloheximide after removal of taxol did not stop the rapid formation of growth cones and neurites in the first 3 - 5 h of recovery . These data indicate that taxol binding to tubulin is reversible , and suggests that the large arrays ofmicrotubules may be depolymerized and reutilized when the cells are returned to normal conditions . DISCUSSION The assembly and disassembly of cytoplasmic microtubules is controlled by a diverse group ofcomponents that determine FIGURE 14 Recovery of neurite outgrowth after removing taxol from culture medium . Neuron in a was cultured 24 h with 7 x 10 - 7 M taxol . Same cell in b is shown 2 . 5 h after washing taxol out of culture medium . Five neurites have been initiated from the tip of the meganeurite ( A ) and from the perikaryon . x 300 . 1360 (cid:9) THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 98 , 1984 where microtubule polymerization begins , as well as the length , number , and stability of microtubules ( 1 , 13 , 17 , 28 , 40 ) . These interactions orchestrate intricate changes in cyto - plasmic microtubules during dynamic processes such as mi - tosis ( 16 ) , cell elongation ( 7 ) , and chemotaxis ( 26 ) . Taxol probably disrupts the control ofmicrotubular organization by sharply lowering the critical concentration of tubulin for assembly of microtubules ( 35 ) . Thus , microtubules may form at unusual sites , and normal signals for disassembly of micro - tubules may not work . This is suggested by the presence in taxol - treated cells of large arrays of closely packed microtu - bules ( 29 , 30 , 33 , 34 , 39 , 43 ) , but an absence of microtubules associated with centrioles or kinetochores of cells entering mitosis ( 10 ) . The inhibition of neurite outgrowth by taxol may result , then , from two primary drug actions ; uncontrolled microtubule assembly and enhanced stability ofmicrotubules ( 3 , 27 , 32 , 35 , 38 ) . The actions of taxol will eventually be better understood from quantitative analyses of the effects of taxol on total amount of cellular tubulin , pools of unpolym - erized tubulin , and number of microtubules per cell . There is general agreement that intact microtubules are required for the initiation and maintenance of neurite growth ( 8 , 9 , 47 ) . However , there is not strong support for a single model explaining how microtubules accumulate in growing neurites ( 14 , 18 , 23 , 37 ) . Possible mechanisms are that stable microtubules are polymerized in the perikaryon before trans - port into the neurites or that tubulin is transported and polymerized within neurites . Of course , both processes may go on , as suggested from studies of microtubule dynamics in mature axons ( 18 ) . It is not clear , however , what is the precise relationship of microtubule assembly , stability , and transport to the immediate events of neurite elongation . When cultured for 24 h in taxol concentrations > 7 x 10 - ' M , some neurons have short processes that we called mega - neurites . However , these processes do not resemble growing neurites in several important respects , and we propose that they are not really neurites in a morphogenetic sense . Evi - dence to indicate that meganeurites do not grow includes the fact that ( a ) there is no concentrated protrusive activity , resembling a growth cone , at the end of meganeuntes , that ( b ) individual meganeurites do not elongate during prolonged videotaping , and that ( c ) microtubules do not terminate at the ends of meganeurites , as in a growing neurite ( 24 ) . These meganeuntes were probably formed from the proximal stumps ofneurites that were severed when the sensory ganglia were dissected and dissociated . Normally , most of these stumps are resorbed into the perikaryon soon after plating , though the stumps can attach to a highly adhesive substratum , regenerate growth cones and initiate outgrowth ( 6 , 45 ) . In the presence oftaxol , the stable microtubules may have stabilized the stumps against collapse , and as the pool of tubulin in the neurons polymerized into more microtubules , the stumps widened into meganeuntes . However , these microtubules ap - parently were not used for neurite outgrowth . A more revealing picture ofmicrotubule metabolism during neurite outgrowth is taxol ' s immediate arrest ofactively grow - ing neurites . The response is so fast , it seems likely due to a rapid assembly of tubulin at the neurite tip . There was not a generation of many short microtubules , but instead tubulin has added onto the many microtubule ends projecting into a growth cone ( 24 ) . Because , few microtubule ends occur prox - imal to the neurite tip ( 23 ) , the rapidly elongating ends looped back towards the perikaryon , depleting the free tubulin in the neurite . These proposed events following addition of taxol would occur only if tubulin subunits are present in neurites , and is consistent with the view that microtubules are dynamic structures and normally undergo assembly in growing neu - rites . Our use oftaxol at 7 x 10 - 9 M is the lowest concentration that has been reported to produce a cellular response ( Table I and Fig . 1 c ) . It is a 100 - fold lower than the association constant for taxol binding to tubulin from calf brain ( 32 ) , so the effect of this concentration may be to slightly stimulate microtubule assembly in neurons . Stimulation ofmicrotubule assembly might be expected to trigger neurite initiation and branching , but instead we observed shorter , broader neurites that were less branched than normally . Apparently , the mech - anisms of neurite outgrowth are not related in a simple way to microtubule assembly . Perhaps , the events of neurite ini - tiation are not disturbed by this low concentration , but the drug enhances production of microtubules at the initiation site , and the neurites maintain an increased numberof micro - tubules by continued transport of many microtubules or free tubulin into the neurites . The infrequent branching ofneurites at this concentration of taxol may be related to the large diameter and microtubule numbers of these neurites . The branching of a neurite tip is thought to involve contractile forces in the growth cone margins that separate the neurite contents into several portions ( 5 , 23 , 44 ) . Perhaps these forces are insufficient to subdivide the extraordinarily large comple - ment of microtubules and associated structures in such large caliber neurites . Though not fully understood , these effects of low concen - trations of taxol are interesting , because they show that major features of neuronal morphology , axon caliber , and branch - ing , could be regulated by a single factor that influences the equilibrium oftubulin assembly . It may turn out that different morphological classes of neurons are distinguished by simple differences in molecular components , such as a microtubule - associated protein that acts like taxol . We also noted that protrusion of the neurite surface is disturbed by taxol . Certainly , this might reduce neurite out - growth , and this response , too , can be related to taxol ' s effects on microtubules . Numerous studies , using colchicine primar - ily , have indicated that microtubules regulate the shape and motility of cell surfaces ( 4 , 6 , 31 , 42 ) , perhaps through an influence on the assembly and associations ofactin filaments . The evidence of interactions between microtubules and mi - crofflaments is sparse ( 12 , 36 ) . Alternatively , Berlin et al . ( 4 ) and Oliver et al . ( 31 ) have suggested that it is membrane - bound tubulin that influences cell surface activity , and the stimulation of microtubule assembly by taxol may substan - tially reduce the availability of tubulin to associate with membranes . At present , however , there is no clear mechanism of how microtubules and / or tubulin influence surface motil - ity . It is not known how the large regular arrays ofmicrotubules in taxol - treated cells or in naturally occurring situations are organized or maintained ( 2 , 10 , 29 , 33 , 34 , 39 , 40 ) . Taxol does not inhibit binding of the protein , microtubule - associ - ated protein 2 , to tubulin ( 41 ) , so this molecule may intercon - nect microtubules with each other and with the elongated membrane sacs ( 11 , 13 , 15 , 40 ) . Neurofilament bundles and tangles were another unusual feature of taxol - treated neurons . Interestingly , these arrays of neurofflaments resemble the masses of neurofilaments in Cochicine - treated neurons ( 47 ) . Perhaps , in both situations there is an enhanced self - associa - tion of neurofilaments when they do not interact with micro - tubules . Colchicine , of course , destroys microtubules , while the regular packing of microtubules in taxol - treated neurons may be energetically favored and exclude interactions with neurofilaments . Microtubule - associated protein 2 binds to neurofilaments and thus may interconnect the neurofilaments in these bundles and tangles ( 19 ) . In summary , taxol is a useful probe of neurite growth . Our findings indicate that microtubules are dynamic structures in growing neurites . The rapid inhibition of growth when taxol is added to neurites is consistent with the proposal that a controlled assembly of microtubules occurs at the neurite tip . Morphological alterations induced by lower concentrations of taxol suggest that factors that modulate the equilibrium of microtubule assembly and disassembly can regulate neuronal shape .
