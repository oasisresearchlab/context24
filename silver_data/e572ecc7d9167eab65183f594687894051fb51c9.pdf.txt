We studied in vitro and in silico the eﬀect of key parameters , actin 14 density , ADF / Coﬁlin concentration and network width on the network length . In the presence of 15 ADF / Coﬁlin , networks reached equilibrium and became globally treadmilling . At the trailing edge , 16 the network disintegrated into large fragments . A mathematical model predicts the network length 17 as a function of width , actin and ADF / Coﬁlin concentrations . Local depletion of ADF / Coﬁlin by 18 binding to actin is signiﬁcant , leading to wider networks growing longer . A single rate of breaking 19 network nodes , proportional to ADF / Coﬁlin density and inversely proportional to the square of the 20 actin density , can account for the disassembly dynamics . Selective disassembly of heterogeneous 21 networks by ADF / Coﬁlin controls steering during motility . Our results establish general principles 22 on how the dynamic equilibrium state of actin network emerges from biochemical and structural 23 feedbacks . 24 25 Introduction 26 Dynamic actin networks play important roles in cell migration ( Rottner and Stradal , 2011 ) , mor - 27 phogenesis ( Hopmann and Miller , 2003 ) , immune response ( Vargas et al . , 2016 ) and intracellular 28 pathogen motility ( Reed et al . , 2014 ) . The architecture and geometry of the actin networks are 29 tightly controlled in these essential cellular processes , and defects in this control cause pathologies , 30 i . e . ageing disorders ( Amberg et al . , 2011 ) . Here , we focus on the equilibrium dynamics of branched 31 ﬁlament arrays that are initiated by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Rotty et al . , 2013 ) , activated by WASP 32 family proteins ( Krause and Gautreau , 2014 ) , and instrumental in lamellipodial extension ( Krause 33 and Gautreau , 2014 ) , pathogen propulsion ( Reed et al . , 2014 ) , endo - and exocytosis ( Li et al . , 2018 ) . 34 35 In many cellular processes , the branched actin networks are polarized and appear in a state 36 of dynamic equilibrium : at their leading edge , barbed ﬁlament ends are oriented forward and 37 polymerize elongating the network , while throughout the network a net disassembly takes place , 38 gradually thinning the network out and limiting the network to a ﬁnite equilibrium length . As 39 a result , the network exist in a “global treadmilling state " ( Borisy and Svitkina , 2000 ; Carlier and 40 Shekhar , 2017 ; Koestler et al . , 2013 ) – as opposed to the well - characterized treadmilling of individ - 41 1 of 34 .

Important examples of such networks are ﬂat lamellipodia at the leading edge of 42 cells migrating on ﬂat surfaces ( Rottner and Stradal , 2011 ; Barnhart et al . , 2011 ; Ofer et al . , 2011 ; 43 Aroush et al . , 2017 ; Rottner and Schaks , 2019 ) and in 3D extracellular matrix ( Fritz - Laylin et al . , 44 2017 ) and cylindrical actin tails propelling intracellular pathogens ( Theriot et al . , 1992 ; Rosenblatt 45 et al . , 1997 ; Lacayo et al . , 2012 ; Reed et al . , 2014 ) , endosomes and lysosomes ( Taunton et al . , 2000 ) . 46 47 In what follows , we call the distance from the leading to trailing edge , the network length , and the 48 characteristic dimension of the leading edge , the network width ( Figure 1 – Figure Supplement 1 B ) . 49 Both length and width of the dynamic network are important physiological parameters ( Carlier 50 and Shekhar , 2017 ) that have to be regulated . For example , the width of the actin tails is usually 51 approximately equal to the size of the pathogen or organelle , which is being propelled by the tail , 52 and the length , presumably , has to be suﬃcient for the tail to be enmeshed with the host cell 53 cytoskeletal scaﬀold . The width and length of lamellipodia probably have to be suﬃcient to ﬁt into 54 the geometry of the extracellular matrix and to accommodate other cytoskeletal elements , such as 55 stress ﬁbers . 56 57 Assembly and disassembly play central roles in determining actin network length ( Theriot et al . , 58 1992 ; Ofer et al . , 2011 ) , yet while assembly is relatively well studied ( Rottner and Schaks , 2019 ) , 59 systems - level understanding of disassembly is lacking . In keratocytes’ cytoplasmic fragments , the 60 lamellipodial length , 𝐿 , is simply determined by the time necessary for the disassembly character - 61 ized by rate 𝛿 to largely degrade the lamellipodial network assembled at the leading edge , so if the 62 actin network growth rate is 𝑉 , then 𝐿 ∼ 𝑉 ∕ 𝛿 ( Ofer et al . , 2011 ) . Similarly , in Listeria ’s actin tail , the 63 network density decreases exponentially , with a constant rate , and the tail’s length is proportional 64 to the pathogen’s speed ( Theriot et al . , 1992 ) . 65 66 As demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro , proteins of the ADF / Coﬁlin family play a key role in the 67 actin disassembly ( Bamburg , 1999 ) , debranching the network , severing the ﬁlaments ( Blanchoin 68 et al . , 2014 ) and accelerating depolymerization at ﬁlaments’ ends ( reviewed in Carlier and Shekhar 69 ( 2017 ) ) . Microscopic details of the ADF / Coﬁlin - mediated kinetics of actin ﬁlaments at the molecular 70 level are being clariﬁed ( Wioland et al . , 2017 ) , but so far there is little understanding about how 71 the net rate of the network disassembly , rather than that of individual ﬁlaments , is determined 72 by the geometry and architecture of the network and by the actin and ADF / Coﬁlin concentrations . 73 Furthermore , spatio - temporal dynamics of ADF / Coﬁlin and its relation to the network disassembly 74 remains obscure . Lastly , actin - network steering , linked to the regulation of network growth at the 75 leading edge ( Boujemaa - Paterski et al . , 2017 ) , is essential to understanding directional cell motility , 76 however , how organization and dynamics of the bulk of the actin network aﬀects the steering is 77 unclear ( Krause and Gautreau , 2014 ) . In this study , we investigated how the geometry , architecture 78 and density of a branched actin network , as well as the ADF / Coﬁlin concentration , aﬀect the actin 79 network dynamics , and found key parameters controlling the network length and steering . 80 81 In order to do that , we combined in vitro and in in silico , approaches . In vitro reconstitution 82 of bacteria and plastic beads propulsion ( Frischknecht et al . , 1999 ; Loisel et al . , 1999 ; Bernheim - 83 Groswasser et al . , 2002 ; Akin and Mullins , 2008 ; Dayel et al . , 2009 ; Achard et al . , 2010 ; Kawska 84 et al . , 2012 ) , and of lamellipodial network growth ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ; Boujemaa - Paterski et al . , 85 2017 ) brought insights on how a minimal set of just two molecular actions – Arp2 / 3 complex - driven 86 nucleation and barbed - end capping – can result in the actin leading edge organization and growth . 87 In this study , we added ADF / Coﬁlin to the mixture of actin , Arp2 / 3 complex and capping protein in an 88 experimental chamber with nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) localized to micro - printed patterns 89 on the surface . We generated a diversity of patterns and studied the impact of the geometry and 90 actin density on the length of dynamic actin networks . We also used quantitative ﬂuorescence 91 imaging to measure the spatial and temporal behavior of the actin and ADF / Coﬁlin densities and 92 2 of 34 .

Crucially , we varied independently three parameters – actin 93 network density , ADF / Coﬁlin concentration and network width – and measured their eﬀect on the 94 network length . 95 96 Mathematical modeling was very successful in deciphering the data from in vitro experiments on 97 the actin disassembly ( Roland et al . , 2008 ; Berro et al . , 2010 ; Michalski and Carlsson , 2010 , 2011 ; 98 Reymann et al . , 2011 ; Stuhrmann et al . , 2011 ; Tania et al . , 2013 ) . Most theoretical studies either 99 considered the disassembly of individual ﬁlaments ( Roland et al . , 2008 ) , or a ﬁrst order reaction of 100 a continuous network density decrease ( Ofer et al . , 2011 ; Reymann et al . , 2011 ; Stuhrmann et al . , 101 2011 ) , or treated the disassembly as a boundary condition ( Aroush et al . , 2017 ) . Pioneering theory 102 of Michalski and Carlsson ( Michalski and Carlsson , 2010 , 2011 ) demonstrated how fragmentation 103 of the network at the trailing edge resulted from stochastic accumulation of discrete disassembly 104 events in the network . No studies so far quantitatively connected the dynamics of ADF / Coﬁlin 105 accumulation in the actin mesh with the eﬀective disassembly rate and the network length . 106 107 An intuitive and expected qualitative ﬁnding of our study is that equilibrium network length 108 increases with actin density , and decreases with ADF / Coﬁlin concentration . The fundamental 109 breakthrough of the study is quantitative : we found a novel simple mathematical relation allowing 110 to predict the actin network length from three parameters – actin network density , ADF / Coﬁlin 111 concentration and network width – and measured their eﬀect on the network length . Other novel 112 and unexpected ﬁndings are : 1 ) ADF / Coﬁlin is locally depleted from solution by binding to actin , 113 which has profound eﬀects on actin disassembly ; 2 ) Network length depends on the network width ; 114 3 ) ADF / Coﬁlin concentration can regulate the steering of heterogeneous actin networks . 115 Results 116 ADF / Coﬁlin action establishes equilibrium length of dynamic actin networks 117 We reconstituted branched actin networks ( called LMs in the following ) that resemble lamellipodia of 118 motile cells by micro - printing rectangular patterns coated with nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) 119 on the ‘bottom’ of the experimental chamber ( Figure 1 – Figure Supplement 1 A ) . NPFs activated the 120 Arp2 / 3 complex , which in turn generated ﬁlament branching , leading to the assembly and growth 121 of the branched actin network at the rectangular network leading edge pattern ( Figure 1 A ) . The 122 thickness of the experimental chamber ( ‘bottom - to - top distance’ ) is only a few microns , so the actin 123 networks lift oﬀ the NPF pattern , bump into the ‘top’ , bend and then grow parallel to the bottom and 124 top ( Figure 1 – Figure Supplement 1 B ) . The networks were ﬂat , similar to the lamellipodial networks : 125 their thickness was but a few microns , an order of magnitude less than the width and length , 126 on the order of tens of microns . Importantly , there is capping protein in the reaction mixture , 127 limiting growth of individual actin ﬁlaments and keeping the actin networks compact , not extending 128 laterally from the NPF pattern . With only actin , Arp2 / 3 and capping protein in the reaction mixture , 129 the networks elongated steadily ( Figure 1 A ) . The networks’ elongation speed 𝑉 was an increasing 130 function of actin density ( Figure 1 B - C ) , in agreement with our previous study ( Boujemaa - Paterski 131 et al . , 2017 ) : higher NPF density that causes greater actin density and a moderate depletion of 132 monomeric actin in the vicinity of the growing barbed ends , also leads to an optimization of the 133 micro - architecture of the network , which translates polymerization into the network elongation 134 more eﬀectively for denser networks . 135 136 Without ADF / Coﬁlin , the networks elongated steadily and did not disassemble – actin density 137 along the networks changed only slightly ( Figure 1 A ) . Addition of ADF / Coﬁlin changed the networks’ 138 dynamics : rather than growing steadily , the networks , after reaching a certain length , started to 139 disassemble at the trailing edge , so that a dynamic equilibrium is reached in which the network 140 length stayed roughly constant ( Figure 2 A ) . The equilibrium length depended on both actin density 141 3 of 34 .

Lamellipodia of variable actin ﬁlament density ( low , medium , high ) were initiated by bar - shaped patterns of diﬀerent NPF - spot densities ( see Figure 1 – Figure Supplement 1 ) and their growth was followed using the ﬂuorescence of the actin networks . Snapshots of the growing lamellipodium were taken 0 , 20 and 60 min after addition of Alexa - 568 labeled actin monomers . B . Denser patterns generate denser actin networks . The network density was measured across the LMs ( for low density networks , n = 25 from 3 experiments , for medium density networks , n = 41 from 3 experiments and for high density networks , n = 38 from 3 experiments ) . C . Denser patterns generate longer actin networks . The lengths of the LMs were measured after 60 min and plotted according to the pattern density . Figure 1 – Figure supplement 1 . Laser micropatterning method and network geometry . and ADF / Coﬁlin concentration . The addition of ADF / Coﬁlin did not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the 142 growth rate of the networks , in contrast to the in vivo cases . The reason is that the total amount of 143 actin in the in vitro chamber is vastly greater than the total network actin , and so the polymerizable 144 actin monomer concentration is unaﬀected by the actin turnover related to the networks’ dynamics ; 145 in other words , actin does not have to be recycled . This has an important consequence for the in 146 vitro global treadmill : the rate of the network growth depends on the conditions at the leading edge 147 ( actin density and architecture ) but is unaﬀected by the network length . Thus , the equilibrium length 148 of the treadmilling network is determined by the length - dependent disassembly only : the longer 149 the network is , the faster is the disassembly at the trailing edge , and so the treadmilling length is 150 determined by the dynamic stable equilibrium , in which the trailing edge disassembly rate is equal 151 to the leading - edge growth rate . As the leading - edge growth rate is unaﬀected by ADF / Coﬁlin , our in 152 vitro assay allows to investigate the eﬀect of the ADF / Coﬁlin - mediated disassembly on the network 153 length , without complications of feedbacks between disassembly and assembly . 154 155 Our data revealed that the equilibrium network length decreases with the ADF / Coﬁlin concentra - 156 tion and increases with the actin density ( Figure 2 A - B ) . Qualitatively , these results are very intuitive : 157 higher ADF / Coﬁlin concentration increases the disassembly rate , hence the equilibrium between 158 the leading edge growth and trailing edge disassembly is reached at shorter lengths . If the actin 159 network is denser at the leading edge , it takes a longer time to break such network down ; during 160 this time , the steadily elongating network grows longer until the disassembly rate at the trailing 161 edge balances the leading edge growth . 162 4 of 34 .

It is reasonable to assume that ADF / Coﬁlin binding is a diﬀusion - limited reaction , and 168 so its rate is proportional to the product of the ADF / Coﬁlin concentration in the solution , 𝐶 0 , and 169 of the constant actin ﬁlament density , 𝐴 . Indeed , when we analyzed the initial rate of binding of 170 ADF / Coﬁlin near the leading edge for networks that had just started to grow ( using various actin 171 densities and at various ADF / Coﬁlin concentrations ) , we found that this rate is proportional to 172 𝐶 0 . We also found a strong correlation between the initial increase in bound ADF / Coﬁlin and 𝐶 0 𝐴 173 ( 𝑅 = 0 . 51 , 𝑃 < 0 . 001 , see the Mathematical Appendix for details ) . This conﬁrms that at least at the 174 beginning of network growth , the ADF / Coﬁlin binding rate is indeed 𝑘 𝐵 𝐶 0 𝐴 , where 𝑘 𝐵 is the binding 175 constant . 176 177 If this rate stays constant , then the bound ADF / Coﬁlin density as a function of time and of distance 𝑦 from the network leading edge is the solution of the equation 𝜕 𝑡 𝐶 𝐵 + 𝑉 𝜕 𝑦 𝐶 𝐵 = 𝑘 𝐵 𝐶 0 𝐴 , where 𝑉 is the rate of actin network growth at the leading edge . Since newly polymerized actin is free of ADF / Coﬁlin , we can assume 𝐶 𝐵 ( 𝑦 = 0 ) = 0 . In dynamic equilibrium , this equations yields the solution 𝐶 𝐵 ( 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑘 𝐵 𝐶 0 𝐴𝑦 𝑉 , which can be easily understood : an actin spot takes time 𝑦 ∕ 𝑉 to drift a distance 𝑦 from the leading edge . As ADF / Coﬁlin binds with rate 𝑘 𝐵 𝐶 0 𝐴 , by that time the bound ADF / Coﬁlin density reaches the value of 𝑘 𝐵 𝐶 0 𝐴𝑦 𝑉 . Assuming that the network falls apart when a critical amount of ADF / Coﬁlin per actin ﬁlament , 𝐶 𝐵 ∕ 𝐴 = 𝛾 , is reached , this yields an equilibrium network length of 𝐿 ∗ = 𝛾𝑉 𝑘 𝐵 𝐶 0 . This simple model predicts , that the equilibrium network length is proportional to the ADF / Coﬁlin 178 concentration in the solution , 𝐶 0 , in qualitative agreement with the data ( compare Figure 2 A - B ) . In 179 Figure 2 A - B , we also observe a clear correlation between the actin density and the network length . 180 Since denser networks also grow faster ( Figure 1 C ) , our estimate is again in qualitative agreement 181 with Figure 2 A - B , however , it appears that the network growth rate increases only weakly with 182 the actin density , while the equilibrium network length increases dramatically , when the actin 183 ﬁlament density increases . Lastly , the simple model indicates that the equilibrium network length is 184 independent of the network width . 185 Equilibrium network length increases with the network width . 186 We tested this last prediction experimentally for networks of widths 15 , 30 and 90 𝜇𝑚 , and the result 187 shows that this is not the case ( Figure 2 C - D ) . In fact , we observe that , while for all network widths 188 their lengths decrease if ADF / Coﬁlin is added , wider networks are aﬀected less . This suggests 189 three potential factors that the simple initial model did not take into account : 1 ) ADF / Coﬁlin is 190 unable to diﬀuse from the solution to the inner parts of the wider dense actin network . 2 ) There 191 is a non - local mechanical eﬀect that leads to an eﬀective protection of wider networks against 192 degradation . 3 ) Local depletion of ADF / Coﬁlin . As previously reported ( Boujemaa - Paterski et al . , 193 2017 ) , actin monomers are locally depleted due to a sink of its concentration in the vicinity of the 194 growing barbed ends ; a similar eﬀect could emerge for ADF / Coﬁlin . 195 196 To estimate the potential eﬀect of the actin network on the ADF / Coﬁlin diﬀusion constant , we 197 used the theory developed in Novak et al . ( 2009 ) and described in the Appendix to determine the 198 eﬀective diﬀusion constant of ADF / Coﬁlin inside the actin network . This calculation shows that the 199 eﬀect of even a dense actin network on the ADF / Coﬁlin diﬀusion coeﬃcient is a reduction by a few 200 per cent only , i . e . the diﬀusion constant will be virtually unaﬀected by the actin network , ruling 201 6 of 34 .

The second factor , a global mechanical structure of the network , is unlikely , 202 since the average actin ﬁlaments are of sub - micron size , two orders of magnitude shorter than the 203 network width , and long actin bundles are absent . Thus , we decided to investigate the third factor , 204 local depletion of ADF / Coﬁlin . 205 Rate of ADF / Coﬁlin binding decreases with time . 206 According to the simple initial model , the rate of ADF / Coﬁlin binding to an actin spot , 𝑘 𝐵 𝐶 0 𝐴 , should 207 be constant , and so if we focus on such a spot drifting from the leading edge backward with a 208 constant speed , we should measure linear increase of the ADF / Coﬁlin density with the slope that 209 does not depend on the time when the spot originates . We measured the initial increase of the 210 ADF / Coﬁlin density , ̇𝐶 𝐵 , near the leading edge by making measurements at diﬀerent starting times 211 for each network . We indeed found that the increase of the ADF / Coﬁlin density is linear with time , 212 however , the rate of ADF / Coﬁlin binding decreased with starting time ( Figure 3 A - B ) , rather than 213 remaining constant . 214 ADF / Coﬁlin is locally depleted by binding to the growing actin network . 215 To conﬁrm that the decrease of the ADF / Coﬁlin binding rate with time is due to the local ADF / Coﬁlin depletion , we analyzed the simplest model of the spatial - temporal ADF / Coﬁlin dynamics compatible with our observation . In the model , the density of free ADF / Coﬁlin molecules diﬀusing in the solute is denoted by 𝐶 𝐹 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) . Since the experimental chamber’s depth in 𝑧 - direction is much smaller than all characteristic dimensions ( including those of the actin network ) in 𝑥 - and 𝑦 - directions , we use a 2D setting for modeling , with the space variables ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 ) ∈ ℝ 2 . In the simulations , an actin network of width 𝑊 and length 𝐿 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑡𝑉 is positioned at  = [ − 𝑊 ∕2 , 𝑊 ∕2 ] × [ 0 , 𝐿 ( 𝑡 ) ] . The model consists of the following equations : 𝜕 𝑡 𝐶 𝐵 + 𝑉 𝜕 𝑦 𝐶 𝐵 = 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴𝐶 𝐹 − 𝑟 𝑈 𝐶 𝐵 , ( 1 ) 𝜕 𝑡 𝐶 𝐹 = 𝐷 Δ 𝐶 𝐹 − 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴𝐶 𝐹 + 𝑟 𝑈 𝐶 𝐵 . ( 2 ) 𝐶 𝐹 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 0 ) = 𝐶 0 , 𝐶 𝐵 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 0 ) = 0 . 𝐴 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) = 0 , ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 ) ∉  . Here Eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) describe drift of the bound and diﬀusion of free ADF / Coﬁlin molecules , re - 216 spectively , and the reactions of ADF / Coﬁlin binding to and slow unbinding from actin ﬁlaments . 217 The third line gives the initial conditions . As boundary condition for 𝐶 𝐵 we use 𝐶 𝐵 ( 𝑥 , 0 , 𝑡 ) = 0 . Other 218 boundary conditions and the numerical procedure for solving the model equations are discussed 219 in the Appendix , but note that the macroscopic model does not account for an ATP - F - actin band , 220 for which ADF / Coﬁlin has a much lower aﬃnity . The reason is that such an ATP - F - actin band is very 221 narrow ( see Discussion for details ) . 222 223 In these equations , the actin density is zero away from the growing rectangle representing the 224 actin network . The model does not describe actin disassembly , as we model the eﬀect of ADF / Coﬁlin 225 on actin ﬁlaments below in the next section . Thus , on this rectangle , we either assume the actin 226 density to be constant for rough estimates ( the measurements show that the actin density changes 227 relatively little along the network before plunging at the trailing edge , see Figure 3 E ) , or equal to the 228 measured function of the 𝑦 - coordinate to compare with the data . 229 230 We can use ( 2 ) with constant actin ﬁlament density 𝐴 to estimate the local concentration of free ADF / Coﬁlin near the actin network : The ﬂux of the free ADF / Coﬁlin to the network by diﬀusion , ( 𝐶 0 − 𝐶 𝐹 ) 𝐷 , has to balance the ‘consumption’ of the free ADF / Coﬁlin by binding to the network , i . e . ( 𝐶 0 − 𝐶 𝐹 ) 𝐷 ≈ 𝑊 𝐿 ( 𝑟 𝐵 𝐶 𝐹 𝐴 − 𝑟 𝑈 𝐶 𝐵 ) , 7 of 34 .

( 3 ) Below , we show that the unbinding of ADF / Coﬁlin is very slow ; besides , near the leading edge , 𝐶 𝐵 ≈ 0 , and so : ̇𝐶 𝐵 ≈ 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴𝐶 0 𝐷 𝐷 + 𝐴𝑊 𝐿𝑟 𝐵 . When the network grows , its length 𝐿 increases , and hence , as shown by these formulas , the local 231 concentration of free ADF / Coﬁlin near the actin network decreases with time , and so does the 232 rate of ADF / Coﬁlin binding at the leading edge , in agreement with the measurements ( Figure 3 B ) . 233 This provides a direct demonstration of the local depletion of ADF / Coﬁlin due to the diﬀusion and 234 binding to the network . We simulated the full 2D model ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) using parameters estimated from 235 our data and taken from the literature ( details in the Appendix ) and ﬁnd a signiﬁcant depletion ef - 236 fect near the network where the free ADF / Coﬁlin concentration drops by as much as 50 % ( Figure 3 D ) . 237 238 To further test the model , we used the measurements of the actin density along the networks 239 giving us functions 𝐴 ( 𝑦 ) for tens of the networks of various densities at a certain time after the actin 240 growth was initiated , and simulated ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) with these functions . This allowed direct comparison 241 of measured and predicted ADF / Coﬁlin concentrations along the network . Figure 3 E - F shows that 242 the model recapitulates the distance - dependent concentrations and relative amounts of bound 243 ADF / Coﬁlin very well . We note that ADF / Coﬁlin unbinding predicted by the model is slow ; omitting 244 the eﬀect of ADF / Coﬁlin unbinding ( i . e . setting 𝑟 𝑈 = 0 in the model ) makes the ﬁts to the data less 245 perfect , however , the estimates of the overall amount of bound ADF / Coﬁlin changes little . 246 Equilibrium length of actin network as a function of biochemical and geometric 247 parameters 248 Actin network fragmentation at the trailing edge . 249 When one observes the time lapse data of actin network dynamics at the trailing edge , it becomes 250 apparent that the network does not disassemble continuously , but rather small , micron - size , pieces 251 of the network break oﬀ ( Figure 4 A ) . Thus , the network disassembles by macroscopic fragmenta - 252 tion . To capture this dynamics , we followed the theory introduced in Michalski and Carlsson ( 2010 , 253 2011 ) and modeled the network as a 2D ensemble of edges connected by nodes . We emphasize 254 that this representation is highly idealized , and the that the edges do not stand for individual 255 ﬁlaments , but rather represent actin ﬁlaments arrays ; similarly , nodes are not individual physi - 256 cal Arp2 / 3 complexes , but are abstracted crosslinking and / or branching points . We model the 257 disassembling eﬀect of ADF / Coﬁlin by removing the nodes with certain rate , 𝑃 . Once a piece of 258 the network becomes disconnected from the main body of the network due to this edge removal , 259 we assume that this piece diﬀuses away and we delete it . Figure 4 C illustrates how the model works . 260 261 The key to the model behavior is setting rules that describe how the rate of breakage per node 262 varies spatially . It is natural to assume that this rate is a function of local densities of ﬁlamentous 263 actin and bound ADF / Coﬁlin . We also assume , for simplicity , that we can neglect a potentially 264 complex eﬀect of sequential biochemical reactions preceding the breakage events . As we already 265 mentioned , the eﬀect of fast hydrolysis on actin ﬁlaments is , in fact , negligible . Considering that 266 both modeling and data shows that the bound ADF / Coﬁlin density changes little compared to actin 267 near the trailing edge , we assume that the rate of breakage is a function of a spatially constant 268 bound ADF / Coﬁlin density . Thus , in the model , the rate of breakage ( node disappearance ) varies 269 locally due to spatial variation of the local density of the actin network ( we calculate the local density 270 of the discrete network as a weighted average of the number of the network edges in the vicinity of 271 a given node ; details in the Appendix ) . It is reasonable to assume that the node breakage rate would 272 9 of 34 .

We found that for many values of these exponents , the model was 279 able to recapitulate several key features of the observed actin network disassembly ( Figure 4 B ) . 280 Speciﬁcally , the modeled dynamic networks were fragmenting at the trailing edge and forming holes 281 near the edge . Analogously to the observations , we found that the modeled networks , after an 282 initial period of growth , reached an equilibrium length , around which the network length ﬂuctuated 283 stochastically ( Figure 4 D inset ) . The model also predicted correctly the relatively small variation of 284 the actin density along the network length , with a sharp drop at the trailing edge ( Figure 4 E ) . 285 286 For comparison with data , it is useful to derive an analytical approximation of the discrete , stochastic model . In the Appendix , we introduce continuous deterministic densities of actin ﬁlament and of broken nodes in the network , derive diﬀerential equations for these densities and solve these equations . This continuous deterministic model allows deriving analytical expression for 10 of 34 .

( 4 ) Figure 4 D shows excellent agreement between the analytical approximation ( 4 ) and the correspond - 287 ing network simulations . 288 289 To determine the values of the exponents 𝛼 and 𝛽 , we examined all networks in the experiments 290 that have reached equilibrium , measured the values of parameters 𝐿 , 𝑉 , 𝐴 0 and 𝐶 𝐵 ( for 𝐶 𝐵 we used 291 the average across the network ) for each network , and compared the actual equilibrium lengths 292 to the ones predicted by formula ( 4 ) based on the measured values of parameters 𝑉 , 𝐴 0 and 𝐶 𝐵 . 293 We found that for any 𝛼 ∈ [ 1 , 3 ] and 𝛽 ∈ [ 0 . 5 , 1 . 2 ] , we had 𝑅 2 - values of over 0 . 7 , and 𝑝 < 10 −7 . In the 294 following we use 𝛽 = 1 , 𝛼 = 2 ( 𝑅 2 = 0 . 72 , 𝑝 < 10 −8 ) . Figure 4 F shows the quadratic dependence of the 295 equilibrium network length on the initial actin density . This ﬁt suggests that rate of disassembly 296 of the eﬀective network nodes is proportional to the bound ADF / Coﬁlin density and inversely 297 proportional to the square of the local actin density . We discuss implications of this ﬁnding below . 298 Balance between accumulation of ADF / Coﬁlin in longer networks and accumulation of 299 network - breaking events predicts equilibrium network length . 300 We can now combine the results from two models – for ADF / Coﬁlin binding and for network disassembly – to understand how the ADF / Coﬁlin dynamics and network fragmentation determine the equilibrium network length . In light of the relation 𝐿 ∝ 𝑉 𝐴 20 𝐶 𝐵 , ( 5 ) all that remains is to use the model from the previous section to estimate the average density of bound ADF / Coﬁlin 𝐶 𝐵 and substitute the value into Eq . ( 5 ) . In the Appendix , we derived the following analytical estimate , based on the analysis of Eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 1 ) : 𝐶 𝐵 ∝ 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴 0 𝐶 0 𝐿 𝑉 × 𝐷 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴 0 𝑊 𝐿 + 𝐷 , ( 6 ) which provides an explicit formula for the average density of bound ADF / Coﬁlin as a function of the 301 leading edge actin density , rate of the network growth at the leading edge , the network dimensions 302 and baseline ADF / Coﬁlin concentration . This estimate has a simple interpretation : The ﬁrst factor 303 gives the average amount of the bound ADF / Coﬁlin in the absence of depletion . This amount is 304 proportional to the actin density , baseline ADF / Coﬁlin concentration and network length because 305 the ADF / Coﬁlin binding rate is proportional to the actin density and solute ADF / Coﬁlin concentration . 306 Further the longer the network , the more time it grows allowing more ADF / Coﬁlin to bind . By a 307 similar argument , faster network growth allow less time for ADF / Coﬁlin to bind . The second factor 308 in Eq . ( 6 ) represents a depletion factor , between 0 and 1 , which shows by which fraction the local 309 free ADF / Coﬁlin concentration near the network is decreased relative to the baseline concentration 310 𝐶 0 . The larger the network ( width 𝑊 or length 𝐿 or both are large ) , or the denser the network 311 ( 𝐴 0 is large ) , the more ADF / Coﬁlin is depleted . Finally faster diﬀusion ( greater value of diﬀusion 312 coeﬃcient 𝐷 ) reduces the eﬀect of depletion . 313 314 Note that the estimated amount of bound ADF / Coﬁlin in Eq . ( 6 ) depends on the equilibrium 315 length 𝐿 itself . Thus , the network equilibrium length is determined by the balance between two 316 feedbacks ( Figure 5 A ) : the network length is shortened by higher ADF / Coﬁlin density , while the 317 bound ADF / Coﬁlin density is increased by the network length . Mathematically , the ﬁrst feedback is 318 expressed by Eq . ( 5 ) and eﬀectively gives the bound ADF / Coﬁlin density as the decreasing function 319 of the network length , while the second feedback is expressed by Eq . ( 6 ) that gives the bound 320 11 of 34 .

It . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 437806 doi : bioRxiv preprint Manuscript submitted to eLife ADF / Coﬁlin density as the increasing function of the network length ( Figure 5 A ) . Together , these 321 two equations constitute an algebraic system of equations for two variables – 𝐿 and 𝐶 𝐵 – that has a 322 unique solution for each value of four parameters 𝐴 0 , 𝐶 0 , 𝑉 , 𝑊 given graphically by the intersection 323 of two curves for the relations 𝐶 𝐵 ( 𝐿 ) given by Eq . ( 6 ) and Eq . ( 5 ) as shown in Figure 5 A . In particular , 324 since these two curves will always intersect , the network will reach some equilibrium length for 325 any parameter combination . The eﬀect of varying individual factors can now easily be understood 326 ( Figure 5 B ) and allows to elucidate the experimental observations from Figure 2 : Increasing the 327 ADF / Coﬁlin concentration leads to more bound ADF / Coﬁlin and thereby shorter networks ( Figure 5 B , 328 top ) . Interestingly increasing network density leads to less disassembly on the one hand , but also to 329 more depletion . However , overall , the increased stability dominates over the depletion eﬀect , and 330 denser networks grow longer ( Figure 5 B , bottom ) . Figure 2 B shows very good agreement between 331 the model and the measurements . In the second experiment in Figure 2 C - D , wider networks were 332 less aﬀected by ADF / Coﬁlin . The model suggests that this is because wider networks lead to more 333 depletion and hence longer networks ( Figure 5 B , middle ) , again in excellent , quantitative agreement 334 with the measured lengths Figure 2 D . 335 ADF / Coﬁlin regulates steering of heterogeneous networks 336 In Boujemaa - Paterski et al . ( 2017 ) we found that network heterogeneity – varying actin ﬁlament 337 density along the network leading edge – induces network steering , in the sense that the hetero - 338 geneous network grows curved . We explained this eﬀect by the observation that the denser part 339 of the network grows faster than the less dense part . Since these two parts of the network are 340 interconnected , the only way for two network parts of diﬀerent lengths to stick together is if they 341 grow along the arc of a circle . Then the faster part with the long axis further from the circle’s center 342 can grow longer , while advancing along the same arc length as the slower part ( Figure 6 Ac ) . This 343 argument was purely geometric and implicitly assumed that the networks are plastic , bending 344 freely . In fact , most likely the networks are elastic or viscoelastic ( Gardel et al . , 2004 ) , which aﬀects 345 their bending behavior . 346 347 To simulate the steering heterogeneous network , we modeled the two networks as two elastic beams growing side - by - side . The networks had diﬀerent densities and diﬀerent growth speeds ; we took the values of those from the data ( Figure 6 D ) . We used the result of Gardel et al . ( 2004 ) that the actin network elasticity 𝐸 scales with actin density 𝐴 as 𝐸 ∝ 𝐴 2 . 5 . We therefore modeled the networks as two attached beams of width 𝑊 , growing at speeds 𝑉 1 and 𝑉 2 , with elastic moduli 𝐸 1 and 𝐸 2 . In the absence of ADF / Coﬁlin we can assume that the densities and hence elasticities stay constant along the network . In the Appendix we demonstrated , that in mechanical equilibrium , the heterogeneous network forms a bent shape with constant curvature 𝜅 ( Figure 6 A - C ) : 1 𝜅 = 1 𝑊 ( 𝑉 1 + 𝑉 2 𝑉 1 − 𝑉 2 + ( 𝜎 − 1 ) 𝑉 1 𝜎 − 𝑉 2 4 𝜎 ( 𝑉 1 − 𝑉 2 ) ) , ( 7 ) growing with speed : 𝑉 ℎ = 𝑉 1 + 𝑉 2 2 − ( 𝑉 1 − 𝑉 2 ) ( 𝑉 21 𝜎 2 − 𝑉 22 ) 2 ( 𝑉 21 𝜎 2 + 6 𝑉 1 𝑉 2 𝜎 + 𝑉 22 ) ( 8 ) Here 𝜎 = 𝐸 2 ∕ 𝐸 1 is the ratio of the elastic moduli . The dependencies of the curvature and combined 348 network length on parameter 𝜎 are depicted in Figure 6 B and C , respectively . Note that if both 349 networks have the same elastic properties , i . e . 𝜎 = 1 , the heterogeneous network elongates with the 350 average speed slightly less than ( 𝑉 1 + 𝑉 2 ) ∕2 , and the radius of curvature has the much simpler form 351 1∕ 𝜅 = ( 1∕ 𝑊 ) ( 𝑉 1 + 𝑉 2 ) ∕ ( 𝑉 1 − 𝑉 2 ) , an approximation that has been used in Boujemaa - Paterski et al . 352 ( 2017 ) . The steering direction ( right or left ) is solely determined by which part of the network grows 353 faster – the heterogeneous network always steers towards the slower sub - network . Diﬀerences 354 in elasticity , however , can inﬂuence the amount of steering in a complex way . Figure 6 A - C shows 355 13 of 34 .

There is a maximal steering curvature achieved for a certain elasticity 357 ratio depending on the ratio of the speeds of the sub - network growth . 358 359 To asses the eﬀect of ADF / Coﬁlin on heterogeneous networks , we used the model from the 360 previous sections to calculate the equilibrium lengths of the two sub - networks and simulate the 361 heterogeneous networks . Since the two sub - networks compete for the same pool of ADF / Coﬁlin , 362 we need to adjust the depletion factor in Eq . ( 6 ) . As described in the Appendix we can determine 363 two equilibrium lengths 𝐿 1 and 𝐿 2 of the sub - networks . Eﬀectively both networks will reach longer 364 lengths together than in isolation , since there is more local depletion of ADF / Coﬁlin in the combined 365 network . In addition , the sparser network is aﬀected more by the depletion , as the denser networks 366 ‘uses up’ disproportionately more ADF / Coﬁlin . Also , the network densities are not constant along 367 the sub - networks , thereby leading to varying elasticities along the network . In terms of the model , 368 this means that the parameter 𝜎 becomes a function of the distance from the leading edge . Finally , 369 the sparser sub - network has a trailing edge much closer to the leading edge than the dense one . 370 Altogether , these factors mean that in the presence of ADF / Coﬁlin , the heterogeneous network will 371 initially ( closer to the leading edge ) have the same curvature as without ADF / Coﬁlin . Further away 372 the curvature decreases until the shorter sub - network fully disassembled , after which the longer 373 Control 250 nM 500nM 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Steering of high - density networks ADF / Cofilin * * * * * * Low High + 200 nM ADF / Cofilin + 10 min + 30 min + 60 min Control Control Low High High High High Med Med Med Med V 1 V 2 a b c d e 0 1 C u r v a t u r e R a d i u s Elasticity Ratio σ 0 a b c d e V 1 ( V 1 + V 2 ) / 2 V2 0 1 N e t w o r k Sp ee d Elasticity Ratio σ a b c d e Simulation A B C D E F G Control + 250 nM ADF / Cofilin + 500 nM ADF / Cofilin V 1 + V 2 V 1 - V 2 1 W Actin ActinADF / Cofilin ActinADF / Cofilin R ad i u s o f c u r v a t u r e ( μ m ) Figure 6 .

Figure 6 E shows that 374 numerical simulations conﬁrm these arguments and generate predictions for various ADF / Coﬁlin 375 concentrations . 376 377 We imaged the curving heterogeneous networks ( Figure 6 D ) and found that indeed increased 378 ADF / Coﬁlin concentration straightens the combined network ( Figure 6 F ) due to selective disassem - 379 bly of the sparser sub - network and relieving the elastic constrain on the denser sub - network . The 380 data not appear qualitatively like the predicted shapes , the measurements of the average curvatures 381 give the same values as those predicted by the model ( Figure 6 F ) . Note , that the curvature changes 382 very little on average when ADF / Coﬁlin concentration is increased from 250 to 500 𝑛𝑀 because in 383 both cases the sparser sub - network is almost completely disassembled . 384 385 A dramatic illustration that the eﬀect of ADF / Coﬁlin can not only straighten , but also induce 386 steering in heterogeneous networks , which grow straight in the absence of ADF / Coﬁlin , is given 387 by the assay shown in Figure 6 G . In this assay , the sparse sub - network was in the middle ; two 388 denser networks were at the sides of this central sub - network , and two more sparse sub - networks 389 ﬂanked the denser ones at the edges . Without ADF / Coﬁlin , such combined network grew straight 390 due to its mirror symmetry . Upon addition of ADF / Coﬁlin , the sparse sub - network in the middle 391 was selectively disassembled , isolating the right and left heterogeneous networks from each other , 392 which led to their steering away from each other . 393 Discussion 394 Summary of the results 395 We found that addition of ADF / Coﬁlin switched the actin networks’ steady length increase to a 396 ‘global treadmilling’ regime , in which the networks , after an initial growth stage , reach a dynamic 397 equilibrium , with the network growing at the leading edge and falling apart at the trailing edge , 398 and its length ﬂuctuating around a constant . We observed that at the trailing edge , the network 399 was stochastically fragmented into little pieces , rather than depolymerizing microscopically . Experi - 400 ments showed that the equilibrium network length decreases with ADF / Coﬁlin concentration , and 401 increases with the actin density and growing speed . The novel and counter - intuitive observation 402 that the equilibrium network length increases with network width motivated the formulation of a 403 computational model for ADF / Coﬁlin dynamics and subsequent comparison between simulated 404 and measured spatio - temporal distributions of ADF / Coﬁlin and actin ﬁlament density . This led to a 405 new insight : ADF / Coﬁlin is locally depleted from the solution by binding to actin ﬁlaments , which 406 has a profound eﬀect on actin disassembly , explaining why wider treadmilling networks are longer . 407 While the eﬀect of local depletion of actin monomers due to binding to actin ﬁlaments was recently 408 reported both in vitro ( Boujemaa - Paterski et al . , 2017 ) and in vivo ( Dimchev et al . , 2017 ) , the eﬀect 409 of local depletion of an actin accessory protein is reported here for the ﬁrst time , to the best of 410 our knowledge . This points to the possibility that similar depletion eﬀects of other actin binding 411 proteins could be important for actin network dynamics or other dense actin organizations . 412 413 The fundamental new ﬁndings of our study are quantitative : a single rate of disassembly , pro - 414 portional to the local bound ADF / Coﬁlin density and inversely proportional to the square of local 415 actin network density , can reproduce all experimental results . As a result , we were able to describe 416 the dynamic equilibrium of actin networks with a simple formula , which we discuss further below , 417 allowing to predict the length of the actin network as a function of its width , actin ﬁlament density , 418 ADF / Coﬁlin concentration and growth rate . Finally , we made the novel observation that hetero - 419 geneous networks grow curved , and that the radius of curvature increases with the ADF / Coﬁlin 420 concentration . A model suggests that ADF / Coﬁlin mediated disassembly eﬀectively changes the 421 elasticity of the networks in a spatially graded way , which aﬀects the network curvature of hetero - 422 15 of 34 .

Thus , ADF / Coﬁlin can locally regulate the steering of heterogeneous 423 networks . 424 Relation to previous studies 425 Our observations and modeling results are in agreement with previous studies : ADF / Coﬁlin was 426 observed to be distributed roughly uniformly across keratocyte’s and ﬁbroblast’s lamellipodia , with 427 a narrow ADF / Coﬁlin - free zone at the leading edge ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . Similarly , in in vitro 428 actin tails , the ADF / Coﬁlin density increased sub - linearly along the tail away from the leading edge , 429 with the small ADF / Coﬁlin - free gap near that edge ( Reymann et al . , 2011 ) . Just like our model , 430 the theory in Michalski and Carlsson ( 2011 ) predicted an initial slow exponential actin ﬁlament 431 density decay followed by an abrupt decay at the edge of the tail . Such actin density behavior 432 in lamellipodia of motile keratocytes was reported in Barnhart et al . ( 2011 ) ; Aroush et al . ( 2017 ) 433 and other experimental studies . The reason for this density behavior is the cooperative nature of 434 network fragmentation , which accelerates non - linearly at low actin ﬁlament densities and leads to 435 an abrupt falling apart of the network at the trailing edge ( Michalski and Carlsson , 2010 , 2011 ) . 436 437 Our model predicts that eﬀective node - breaking events in the network take place on the scale 438 of one per hundred seconds per micron . This is in agreement with measured severing times 439 in vitro per micron of a ﬁlament of hundreds of seconds for 150 nM of ADF / Coﬁlin and tens of 440 seconds for 1000 nM of ADF / Coﬁlin ( Chin et al . , 2016 ) . The predicted proportionality of this rate 441 to the ADF / Coﬁlin density is in agreement with the observation of the linear proportionality of the 442 debranching to the ADF / Coﬁlin concentration at low concentrations ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000 ) . Similar 443 to Michalski and Carlsson ( 2010 ) , we found that , remarkably , the properties of the actin networks 444 with actin subunits switching between many chemical and physical states can be described by a 445 single eﬀective disassembly rate , proportional to a certain mean of the chemical transition , severing 446 and debranching rates . The discrete and stochastic fragmentation of the actin network at the 447 trailing edge was also predicted in Michalski and Carlsson ( 2011 ) , observed in vitro in Reymann 448 et al . ( 2011 ) , and inferred from in vivo data in Berro et al . ( 2010 ) ; Aroush et al . ( 2017 ) . Just as 449 Michalski and Carlsson ( 2011 ) , our model predicts that the network’s width remains constant along 450 the length , which we also observed . In vivo , this property of the lamellipodial networks is most 451 clearly apparent in keratocytes’ lamellipodial fragments ( Ofer et al . , 2011 ) . Actin comet tails of 452 intracellular pathogens also sometimes appear to have a constant width ( Akin and Mullins , 2008 ) , 453 while under other conditions the tails taper as they decay ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) . 454 455 Previous modeling showed that the length of the treadmilling network is proportional to the 456 polymerization velocity , is inversely proportional to the ADF / Coﬁlin density , and scales linearly 457 with actin concentration ( Michalski and Carlsson , 2010 ) . Fitting our theoretical predictions to our 458 data agrees with these previous predictions , except demonstrating that the network length is 459 proportional to the square of the actin ﬁlament density at the leading edge . The reason for the 460 diﬀerence , most likely , is that in Michalski and Carlsson ( 2010 ) , the network node breaking rate 461 was proportional to the ADF / Coﬁlin density , and the node density scaled with the actin density . We 462 suggest , similarly , that the network node ( eﬀectively , cross - linking and entanglement ) density does 463 scale with the actin density ; however , the breaking ( debranching and severing ) rate is proportional 464 to the ratio of the ADF / Coﬁlin to actin density , which is eﬀectively the length density of ADF / Coﬁlin 465 along actin ﬁlaments . Then , the ratio of the node density to the breaking rate per node , proportional 466 to the square of the actin density divided by the ADF / Coﬁlin density , determines the network length . 467 468 Addition of ADF / Coﬁlin was shown to shorten Listeria actin tails ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Rosenblatt 469 et al . , 1997 ) ; proportionality of the Listeria actin tails’ lengths to the polymerization rate at the 470 leading edge was demonstrated in Theriot et al . ( 1992 ) , and proportionality of the lamellipodial 471 length in motile keratocytes’ fragments to the actin growth rate at the leading edge was reported in 472 16 of 34 .

It . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 437806 doi : bioRxiv preprint Manuscript submitted to eLife Ofer et al . ( 2011 ) . Interestingly , network length as a function of width was predicted to be linearly 473 increasing and then saturating , but saturation happens when the width is on the order of 20 mesh 474 sizes , on the micron scale ( Michalski and Carlsson , 2011 ) , and so this is unrelated to the eﬀect that 475 we report in this study . 476 Novelty of our ﬁndings and relevance to in vivo networks 477 We established a simple formula that allows estimating the network length , 𝐿 , as a function of a wide range of geometric and biochemical parameters : Actin ﬁlament density at the leading edge , 𝐴 0 , speed of actin growth at the leading edge , 𝑉 , width of the network , 𝑊 , and ADF / Coﬁlin density in the solute , 𝐶 0 ( Figure 5 ) : 𝐿 = 𝑘 1 𝐴 20 𝑉 𝐶 𝐵 , 𝐶 𝐵 = 𝑘 2 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴 0 𝐶 0 𝐿 𝑉 × 1 1 + 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴 0 𝑊𝐿 𝐷 , Here 𝐶 𝐵 is the density of ADF / Coﬁlin bound to the network , 𝐷 is the ADF / Coﬁlin diﬀusion coeﬃcient 478 in the solute , 𝑟 𝐵 is the ADF / Coﬁlin binding coeﬃcient , 𝑘 1 ≈ 1 𝑠 ∕ 𝜇𝑀 is a parameter determining the 479 magnitude of the eﬀective debranching severing rate , and 𝑘 2 = 1∕2 is a non - dimensional parameter . 480 481 One consequence of these results is that there are diﬀerent ways for a cell to achieve the same 482 network length . For examples , if the actin density drops and hence the network becomes shorter , 483 there are two ways to re - establish the original network length ( Figure 5 C - F ) : Either the ADF / Coﬁlin 484 concentration has to be decreased , or the network has to become wider . In both cases the pro - 485 cedure is as follows ( compare arrows in Figure 5 E - F ) : 1 . The drop in actin density leads to a new , 486 shorter equilibrium length , 2 . Through intersection with the constant - network length - level curves 487 an alternative parameter combination can be identiﬁed , which gives the original network length . 488 3 . This gives the new ( lower ) ADF / Coﬁlin concentration in solution or new ( higher ) network width 489 necessary to maintain the original network length . This dynamic equilibrium underlies the network’s 490 ability to adapt to external changes . Indeed , cycles between low and high loads generate branched 491 actin networks with diﬀerent densities ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ) . Our model explains how the system will 492 respond to adjust its dimension according to these changes . Similarly , membrane tension aﬀects 493 the lamellipodium’s actin ﬁlament density ( Mueller et al . , 2017 ) . The dynamic equilibrium model 494 predicts how tension sensing will be counterbalanced to preserve the dimension of the growing 495 network . 496 497 We found that diﬀusion of ADF / Coﬁlin in the solution and binding to the growing actin network 498 can locally deplete the cytoplasmic ADF / Coﬁlin , which makes wider and denser actin networks 499 grow longer ( Figure 5 D ) . Quantitatively , whether the depletion is signiﬁcant or not , is determined by 500 the magnitude of the non - dimensional quantity 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴𝑊𝐿 𝐷 : if this factor is smaller than 1 ( e . g . when 501 the network width and length are small enough ) , there is no signiﬁcant depletion ; otherwise , there is . 502 503 Using 𝑟 𝐵 ≈ 0 . 01∕ ( 𝑠𝜇𝑀 ) ( Tania et al . , 2013 ) , we estimated that 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴 ≈ 1∕ 𝑠 ( F - actin density is ≈ 100 𝜇𝑀 for observed branched networks , and so we use this parameter for all estimates ) , and 𝐷 ≈ 10 𝜇𝑚 2 ∕ 𝑠 ( Tania et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , for actin tails propelling intracellular pathogens and organelles , for which 𝑊 ≈ 1 𝜇𝑚 and 𝐿 ≈ 3 𝜇𝑚 , we have : 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴𝑊𝐿 𝐷 ≈ 0 . 3 , and the depletion of ADF / Coﬁlin is present but moderate . In this case , the length of the tails can be estimated by the simple formula : 𝐿 ≈ 𝑉 √ 𝑘 1 𝐴 𝑘 2 𝑟 𝐵 𝐶 ≈ 0 . 1 𝜇𝑚 ∕ 𝑠 × √ 1 𝑠 ∕ 𝜇𝑀 × 100 𝜇𝑀 0 . 5 × 0 . 008∕ ( 𝑠𝜇𝑀 ) × 20 𝜇𝑀 ≈ 3 . 5 𝜇𝑚 , as observed . We used 𝑉 ≈ 0 . 1 𝜇𝑚 ∕ 𝑠 ( Theriot et al . , 1992 ) and assumed that the ADF / Coﬁlin concen - 504 tration in most of animal cells is on the order of 20 𝜇𝑀 ( Pollard et al . , 2000 ) . 505 506 17 of 34 .

It . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 437806 doi : bioRxiv preprint Manuscript submitted to eLife The diﬀusion - limited depletion of ADF / Coﬁlin is also relevant for very large cells , i . e . oocytes , muscle cells , nerve cells , megakaryosytes , with size on the order of hundreds of microns . At such size scale , the ADF / Coﬁlin diﬀusion time is on the order of minutes to many minutes , comparable to the characteristic time of the network treadmill . In these cases , assuming the characteristic dimensions of the ﬂat Arp2 / 3 - controlled networks , 𝑊 ≈ 10 𝜇𝑚 and 𝐿 on the order of 10 𝜇𝑚 , we have 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴𝑊𝐿 𝐷 ∼ 10 , and there is sizable depletion eﬀect for ADF / Coﬁlin . In this case , we predict that 𝐶 𝐵 ≈ 𝑘 2 𝐷𝐶 𝑉𝑊 and so we predict that : 𝐿 ≈ 𝑘 1 𝑘 2 𝐴 2 𝑉 2 𝑊 𝐷𝐶 ≈ 0 . 1 𝑠 ∕ 𝜇𝑀 ( 100 𝜇𝑀 ) 2 × ( 0 . 1 𝜇𝑚 ∕ 𝑠 ) 2 × 10 𝜇𝑚 ( 10 𝜇𝑚 2 ∕ 𝑠 ) × 20 𝜇𝑀 ≈ 10 𝜇𝑚 which is a reasonable estimate . 507 508 We can also use our formulas to estimate the lamellipodial length in usual animal motile cells of intermediate size , like keratocytes and ﬁbroblasts . In those cases , as the characteristic cell size is on the order of tens of microns , the characteristic diﬀusion time for ADF / Coﬁlin molecules is tens of seconds , less than or equal to the characteristic time of the network treadmill , so the local ADF / Coﬁlin depletion has a small eﬀect . However , the lamellipodial actin represents a signiﬁcant fraction of the total cell actin ( Barnhart et al . , 2011 ; Ofer et al . , 2011 ) , and so a signiﬁcant fraction of all ADF / Coﬁlin is bound to the lamellipodial actin ﬁlaments . Thus , the global ADF / Coﬁlin depletion is of a major importance : our estimates of the binding and unbinding rates suggest that majority of ADF / Coﬁlin molecules would be bound to the lamellipodial actin . Then , assuming that the ADF / Coﬁlin concentration is on the order of 20 𝜇𝑀 ( Pollard et al . , 2000 ) and taking into account characteristic volumes of the whole cell and of its lamellipodial part , we estimate that the bound ADF / Coﬁlin in the lamellipodial network has concentration on the order of 𝐶 𝐵 ≈ 100 𝜇𝑀 . Then , the lamellipodial length 𝐿 ≈ 𝑘 1 𝐴 2 𝑉 𝐶 𝐵 ≈ 1 𝑠 ∕ 𝜇𝑀 ( 100 𝜇𝑀 ) 2 × 0 . 1 𝜇𝑚 ∕ 𝑠 100 𝜇𝑀 ≈ 10 𝜇𝑚 , which is the order of magnitude found in experiments . 509 510 The clear in vivo relevance of the branched network steering is illustrated by recent observations 511 that ﬂat Arp2 / 3 - governed sheets of branched actin regulate pathﬁnding of cells in 3D ECM ( Fritz - 512 Laylin et al . , 2017 ) . The question of how motile cells turn is attracting growing attention . A 513 number of turning mechanisms were elucidated . As expected , chemotaxis - related biochemical 514 pathways upstream of the actin network mechanics can regulate lamellipodial steering ( Yang et al . , 515 2016 ) . However , mechanics , architecture and turnover of the network at the leading edge can 516 lead to steering even in the absence of the upstream control . Examples of such mechanisms 517 include Rac - Arpin nonlinear feedbacks regulating of the Arp2 / 3 - branching activity ( Dang et al . , 518 2013 ) , spatially graded thymosin 𝛽 - 4 mediated control of the lamellipodial turning ( Roy et al . , 2001 ) 519 and monomer - diﬀusion mediated steering of heterogeneous actin networks ( Boujemaa - Paterski 520 et al . , 2017 ) . Steering of intracellular pathogens by curving their actin tails depends on harnessing 521 viscoelastic deformations of the actin tails and polymerization forces on the curved pathogen 522 surface to generate actin growth asymmetries ( Lacayo et al . , 2012 ) . Motile cell turning can also 523 rely on alternating types of actin networks ( Diz - Muñoz et al . , 2016 ) and on crosstalk between actin 524 and microtubule dynamics ( Buck and Zheng , 2002 ) . Lastly , cells also can steer from the rear of the 525 networks , by actin - myosin contraction asymmetry mechanism ( Nickaeen et al . , 2017 ) . Our ﬁndings 526 add important additional control mechanism of tuning curvatures of the heterogeneous networks 527 by ADF / Coﬁlin - mediated changes to network elasticity . 528 Model limitations and outstanding questions 529 Our experiments and modeling do not address the microscopic mechanism for the biological 530 function of ADF / Coﬁlin , which is still debated . Our model is not explicitly microscopic and does 531 18 of 34 .

It . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 437806 doi : bioRxiv preprint Manuscript submitted to eLife not distinguish between ADF / Coﬁlin - mediated severing , acceleration of disassembly at ﬁlament 532 ends and debranching ( Chan et al . , 2009 ) ( reviewed in Blanchoin et al . ( 2014 ) ) . Similarly , the model 533 took into account neither ATP hydrolysis on actin subunits and preferential binding of ADF / Coﬁlin 534 to ADP - actin ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ) , nor cooperativity of ADF / Coﬁlin binding ( Hayakawa 535 et al . , 2014 ) , nor ADF / Coﬁlin - induced structural change and destabilization of ﬁlaments ( Pfaendtner 536 et al . , 2010 ; Suarez et al . , 2011 ; Wioland et al . , 2017 ) . Due to technical limitations we did not 537 explore very high ADF / Coﬁlin concentrations , at which over - decoration by ADF / Coﬁlin can lead to 538 ﬁlament stabilization ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) , and rate of debranching can become 539 a nonlinear function of ADF / Coﬁlin concentration Chan et al . ( 2009 ) . Thus , we observed neither 540 non - monotonic dependence of the severing activity on ADF / Coﬁlin concentration ( Andrianantoan - 541 dro and Pollard , 2006 ; Pavlov et al . , 2007 ) , nor independent of the lengths of Listeria actin comet 542 tails on high ADF / Coﬁlin concentrations ( Rosenblatt et al . , 1997 ) . Even though our model did not 543 account for all this microscopic complexity , the model predictions are remarkably eﬃcient , pointing 544 out two important factors : Hydrolysis is fast enough so that only a micron - or sub - micron - size 545 region near the very leading edge is aﬀected by the hydrolysis state of the actin network , which 546 is negligible when we deal with networks longer than a few microns . Also , as we note above , on 547 the more macroscopic scale of the whole network , the microscopic complexity can be eﬀectively 548 combined into one overall disassembly rate . 549 550 We also did not address the emerging molecular complexity of the disassembly process : in vivo , 551 ADF / Coﬁlin often acts in synergy with the ADF cofactor actin - interacting protein 1 ( AIP1 ) , twinﬁlin , 552 coronin and Srv2 / adenylyl cyclase - associated protein ( Kueh et al . , 2008 ; Johnston et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , 553 our modeling and experiments are not applicable to actin patches in yeast , which are so small 554 ( micron scale ) and have such a rapid dynamics ( on the order of seconds ) ( Berro et al . , 2010 ) that 555 some fast microscopic mechanisms employing additional molecular machinery , not accounted 556 for in our study ( see below ) are likely involved . In addition , there are ADF / Coﬁlin - independent 557 disassembly mechanisms , i . e . myosin - powered grinding of the actin network at the cell rear ( Wilson 558 et al . , 2010 ) . This synergy , added to complex nonlinear feedbacks between the branching , assembly 559 and disassembly processes ( Tania et al . , 2013 ) and complex transport and partitioning of actin 560 monomers and ﬁlaments in the cell ( Vitriol et al . , 2015 ; Aroush et al . , 2017 ) cause ADF / Coﬁlin to 561 aﬀect not only the disassembly , but also polymerization rate and network density . For example , 562 higher ADF / Coﬁlin concentration can accelerate growth speed ( Aizawa et al . , 1996 ; Carlier et al . , 563 1997 ) . In the future , the in vitro and in silico studies will have to address this systems - level actin 564 network dynamics . Last , but not least , cell actin networks integrate architectures other than 565 Arp2 / 3 - controlled branched lamellipodia and comet tails , and there is a delicate , incompletely 566 understood dynamic balance between branched , bundled and other networks ( Blanchoin et al . , 567 2014 ) . Dependence of the disassembly on network architecture was recently discovered ( Gressin 568 et al . , 2015 ) . Future models and experiments will have to investigate quantitative rules of the 569 integrated global actin network dynamics . 570 Conclusion 571 Our study leads to the important general conclusion that the cell is able to control the dynamic actin 572 network length by adjusting either geometric , structural , or biochemical parameters , as needed . 573 For example , if the network’s width is dictated by the environment around the cell , then network’s 574 length can be regulated by tuning ADF / Coﬁlin concentration ( Figure 5 C - F ) . On the other hand , if 575 the ADF / Coﬁlin concentration has to be tuned for timely disassembly of other actin structures , 576 then the branched network’s density or width can be changed in order to achieve necessary length 577 ( Figure 5 C - F ) . In other words , there are multiple ways to set the dynamic balance of the biochemical 578 and transport pathways regulating the global actin treadmill . This gives the cell a suﬃcient ﬂexibility 579 in the control of the cytoskeletal geometry , without compromising requirements for mechanical 580 and biochemical parameters to control multiple cytoskeletal functions . 581 19 of 34 .

( 2004 ) . 590 Laser patterning 591 20x20 mm 2 coverslips and cover glasses ( Agar Scientiﬁc ) were extensively cleaned , oxidized with 592 oxygen plasma ( 3 mn at 30 W , Harrick Plasma , Ithaca , NY , USA ) and incubated with 1 mg ml −1 593 of Silane - PEG overnight . Patterns of the desired density and area were printed on Silane - PEG - 594 coated surfaces using a pulsed , passively Q - switched , laser ( STV - E , TeamPhotonics ) that delivers 595 300 ps pulses at 355 nm . The laser power is controlled with a polarizer ( iLasPulse device , Roper 596 Scientiﬁc ) . Following laser patterning , patterned coverslips were coated with a solution of NPF at 597 a concentration of 500 to 1000 nM for 15 min . The excess of NPFs was washed out with G - buﬀer 598 ( 5 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 and 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) ) , and the surface 599 was carefully dried . 600 Reconstituted LMs 601 Assembly of reconstituted LMs was initiated in polymerization chambers of 20x20 mm 2 x4 . 5 µ m 602 height by addition of the actin polymerization mix contained 6 µ M actin monomers ( containing 603 3 % Alexa568 - labeled actin ) , 18 µ M proﬁlin , 120 nM Arp2 / 3 , 25 nM CP , in X buﬀer ( 10 mM HEPES 604 [ pH 7 ] , 0 . 1 M KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , and 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ) and was supplemented with 1 % BSA , 605 0 . 2 % methylcellulose , 3 mM DTT , 0 . 13 mM 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo [ 2 . 2 . 2 ] octane ( DABCO ) , 1 . 8 mM ATP 606 ( Boujemaa - Paterski et al . , 2017 ) . When needed , the polymerization mix also included yeast coﬁlin 607 puriﬁed according to Suarez et al . ( 2011 ) at a concentration of 125 , 250 , or 500 nM . We normal - 608 ized the actin network ﬂuorescence between assays using 0 . 2 µ m TetraSpeck ﬂuorescent beads 609 ( Molecular Probes ) . 610 Image acquisition 611 Image acquisition was performed using an upright Axioimager M2 Zeiss microscope equipped with 612 an EC Plan - Neoﬂuar dry objective ( x20 , NA 0 . 75 ) , a computer controlled ﬂuorescence microscope 613 light source X - Cite 120PC Q ( Lumen Dynamics ) , a motorized XY stage ( Marzhauser ) and an ORCA - 614 ER camera ( Hamamatsu ) . The station was driven by MetaMorph software ( Universal Imaging 615 Corporation ) . The growth rates were calculated using ImageJ software . 616 Mathematical Modeling 617 Details about the mathematical modeling , analysis and simulation can be found in the Appendix . 618 Acknowledgments 619 This work was supported by grants from European Research council ( 741773 ( AAA ) ) awarded to 620 L .

To do so , we used the theory developed in Novak et al . ( 2009 ) , which examines how the presence of obstacles aﬀects the eﬀective diﬀusion constant of a particle . According to Novak et al . ( 2009 ) , the ratio between the ADF / Coﬁlin diﬀusion constant in the cytosol , 𝐷 , and the eﬀective diﬀusion constant of ADF / Coﬁlin in the branched actin network , 𝐷 eﬀ , can be estimated as : 𝐷 eﬀ 𝐷 = ( 1 − 𝜙 ∕ 𝜙 𝑐 ) 𝜇 1 − 𝜙 . In the theory derived in Novak et al . ( 2009 ) , the actin network is represented as a collection of long cylindrical obstacles / ﬁlaments , through which ADF / Coﬁlin molecules diﬀuse . This theory estimates the ratio of the diﬀusion coeﬃcients as the function of three parameters : 𝜙 , 𝜙 𝑐 and 𝜇 . Exponent 𝜇 = 1 . 58 was estimated in Novak et al . ( 2009 ) based on characteristic dimensions of the cylindrical obstacles . Parameter 𝜙 reﬂects the eﬀect of the actin volume fraction on diminishing the diﬀusion coeﬃcient and is given as 𝜙 = 1 − exp ( − 𝑉 ) , where parameter 𝑉 depends on the sum of volumes of individual obstacles per unit volume , and is determined by the number of ﬁlaments per unit area , 𝑓 , the average orientation angle of the ﬁlaments , 𝛼 = 35 ◦ , and the radii of actin ﬁlaments , 𝑟 𝐴 = 3 . 5 𝑛𝑚 , and of ADF / Coﬁlin molecules , 𝑟 𝐶 = 1 . 58 𝑛𝑚 , as follows : 𝑉 = 𝑓 ( 𝑟 𝐴 + 𝑟 𝐶 ) 2 𝜋 sin 𝛼 . ( 9 ) Finally , parameter 𝜙 𝑐 = 0 . 942 characterizes the critically dense network , which completely obstructs the diﬀusion . A conservative estimate can be made by assuming a dense actin network with 𝑓 = 300∕ 𝜇𝑚 2 . This gives estimates of 𝑉 = 0 . 042 and 𝐷 eﬀ = 0 . 97 𝐷 . Thus , the eﬀect of even a dense actin network on the ADF / Coﬁlin diﬀusion coeﬃcient is but a few per cent and can be neglected . 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 Determining initial ADF / Coﬁlin binding rate 816 To determine the ADF / Coﬁlin binding rate ( see Sec . Spatio - temporal ADF / Coﬁlin dynamics and its local depletion in the main text ) , we used the experimentally measured concentrations of ADF / Coﬁlin and actin . We focused on the changes of bound ADF / Coﬁlin concentration at the beginning the network growth , since in this early stage we can neglect both ADF / Coﬁlin unbinding and depletion of free ADF / Coﬁlin . This means that we can assume that : 𝜕 𝑡 𝐶 𝐵 + 𝑉 𝜕 𝑦 𝐶 𝐵 ≈ 𝑏 ( 𝐴 , 𝐶 0 ) , where 𝑏 ( 𝐴 , 𝐶 0 ) is the binding rate we would like to determine . Since we know the network growth speed , we can measure the increase of bound ADF / Coﬁlin ̇𝐶 𝐵 in moving patches of actin , i . e . we can directly measure 𝑏 ( 𝐴 , 𝐶 0 ) . First , we examined networks with similar actin densities 𝐴 , and found a strong correlation ( 𝑅 = 0 . 69 , 𝑝 < 10 −3 ) between the binding rate ̇𝐶 𝐵 and the concentration of the ADF / Coﬁlin in the solute 𝐶 0 ( App . Fig . 1A ) . Next , we examined networks in the experiments with similar solute ADF / Coﬁlin concentrations 𝐶 0 , but with varying actin densities 𝐴 , and found a strong correlation between ̇𝐶 𝐵 and the actin density 𝐴 ( 𝑅 = 0 . 69 , 𝑝 < 10 −5 ) ( App . Fig . 1B ) . Finally , we examined networks with varying 25 of 34 .

All model parameters are gathered in App . Tab . 1 below . We simulate the model in 2D with ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 ) ∈ [ − 𝐵 ∕2 , 𝐵 ∕2 ] × [ − 𝐵 ∕2 , 𝐵 ∕2 ] ⊂ ℝ 2 , where 𝐵 > 0 is the size of the square - shaped domain . The density of free ADF / Coﬁlin molecules diﬀusing in the solute is denoted by 𝐶 𝐹 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) , those bound to the actin network by 𝐶 𝐵 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) . In the simulations , an actin network of width 𝑊 and length 𝐿 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑡𝑉 is positioned at  = [ − 𝑊 ∕2 , 𝑊 ∕2 ] × [ 0 , 𝐿 ( 𝑡 ) ] . The model consists of the following equations : 𝜕 𝑡 𝐶 𝐵 + 𝑉 𝜕 𝑦 𝐶 𝐵 = 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴𝐶 𝐹 − 𝑟 𝑈 𝐶 𝐵 , ( 10 ) 𝜕 𝑡 𝐶 𝐹 = 𝐷 Δ 𝐶 𝐹 − 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴𝐶 𝐹 + 𝑟 𝑈 𝐶 𝐵 , ( 11 ) with the initial conditions 𝐶 𝐹 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 0 ) = 𝐶 0 , 𝐶 𝐵 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 0 ) = 0 , and the boundary conditions : 𝐶 𝐹 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) = 𝐶 0 𝑥 = ± 𝐵 ∕2 or 𝑦 = ± 𝐵 ∕2 𝐶 𝐵 ( 𝑥 , 0 , 𝑡 ) = 0 . In the experiment , networks grow in a large , several square millimeter sized chambers , so that the total amount of ADF / Coﬁlin is not limiting , and moreover , over the time of the experiment , about 60 minutes , diﬀusion is not fast enough to diminish the ADF / Coﬁlin concentration in the solute farther than a few hundred microns from the growing network ( for relevant estimates , see Boujemaa - Paterski et al . ( 2017 ) . ) For this reason , we performed the simulations in the area 1 millimeter in size , smaller that the size of the whole experimental chamber , but large enough so that the concentration of free ADF / Coﬁlin at its boundary is almost identical to the initial ADF / Coﬁlin solute concentration . This justiﬁes using Dirichlet boundary conditions also for 𝐶 𝐹 , rather than no ﬂux boundary conditions . For the actin density , we assume 𝐴 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) ≡ 0 whenever ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 ) ∉  . Within the network , we use two scenarios : The actin density is constant , or the actin density is a function of 𝑦 only , i . e . 𝐴 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) = 𝐴 ( 𝑦 ) , where we use the measured actin density along the network , averaged over 26 of 34 .

The smoothing avoids potential numerical problems when solving partial diﬀerential equations due to the roughness of the measured data . 847 848 849 850 851 852 853 854 855 856 857 858 859 860 861 862 863 864 865 866 867 868 869 870 871 872 873 874 875 Simulation . 876 Parameters are summarized in App . Tab . 1 . To solve Eqs . ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) numerically , we used a splitting scheme : At each timestep 𝑡 𝑛 , we ﬁrst solved the equations 𝜕 𝑡 𝐶 𝐵 = 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴𝐶 𝐹 − 𝑟 𝑈 𝐶 𝐵 , 𝜕 𝑡 𝐶 𝐹 = 𝐷 Δ 𝐶 𝐹 − 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴𝐶 𝐹 + 𝑟 𝑈 𝐶 𝐵 , on the interval [ 𝑡 𝑛 , 𝑡 𝑛 + Δ 𝑡 ] using a Finite Element Method ( FEM ) as implemented by the parabolic solver of Matlab’s PDE toolbox . Since large density gradients can be expected only near the network , we used a triangular FEM - mesh that is much ﬁner on and near the network than far away from it . Overall , the number of mesh triangles was between 2000 and 5000 for each simulation . The mesh itself was time - independent , avoiding having to re - mesh at each time step . Next , we employed a forward - Euler ﬁnite - diﬀerence scheme for the transport term 𝜕 𝑡 𝐶 𝐵 + 𝑉 𝜕 𝑦 𝐶 𝐵 , with shifting the calculated values of 𝐶 𝐵 and subsequent interpolation onto the elements of the mesh . 877 878 879 880 881 882 883 884 885 886 887 888 889 Stochastic fragmentation model : details and simulation 890 In our discrete network model , we describe the network as a collection of nodes and edges in 2D . Each edge represents an array of actin ﬁlaments , each note represents cross - linking or branching points . Our discrete network model follows ideas presented in Carlsson ( 2007 ) ; Michalski and Carlsson ( 2010 , 2011 ) , however we allow our breakage rate to depend on local actin density and present a new analytical approximation ( see Sec . Derivation of analytical model of network fragmentation ) . At its fully connected state each inner node is connected to four edges . We represent the whole network as a graph , i . e . for each node , we track the nodes to which this given node is connected to . During each time step , the discrete network model is updated in four steps : 891 892 893 894 895 896 897 898 899 900 1 . Remove individual nodes . Given an actin density 𝐴 for a given node ( step 4 below ) , we determine a breakage rate per node and time 𝑃 = 𝑝 𝐴 𝛼 , where parameter 𝑝 is a constant . The node breakage follows a Poisson process with rate 𝑃 , and we determine the probability of breakage at each time step as 1 − 𝑒 − 𝑃 Δ 𝑡 . 2 . Remove edges and network pieces . There are two ways edges can be removed : Individually – this happens if both nodes an edge is connected to are removed . On the other hand , a larger network piece could become disconnected as a consequence of step 1 . We considered network segments to be disconnected if they have no connection to the leading edge ( i . e . there is no path of edges connecting the given piece to the leading edge ) and assume disconnected network pieces diﬀuse away quickly . 3 . Grow network . This step simply adds rows of nodes and edges at the leading edge proportional to the network growth speed 𝑉 . 4 . Calculate local actin densities . In our model , the local actin density depends on the number of edges present , not the number of nodes , i . e . if a node is removed within an otherwise fully connected patch , the actin density would not be aﬀected . To calculate the local actin density at a node , we count the number of missing edges within a square patch around the node with a of 𝑟 nod = 2 ( in units of the edge length ) , i . e . we are considering the 24 nodes or 40 edges around the given node . Finally , the determined fraction of the unbroken edges was multiplied by the model parameter 𝐴 0 , the initial actin density . 901 902 903 904 905 906 907 908 909 910 911 912 913 914 915 916 917 918 919 27 of 34 .

It . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 437806 doi : bioRxiv preprint Manuscript submitted to eLife Implementation and Parameters . 920 We performed numerical tests and found that as long as the node number along the leading edge , 𝐾 , is larger than ≈ 20 , the equilibrium length is barely aﬀected by the choice of 𝐾 ( as noted also in Carlsson ( 2007 ) ) . We therefore decided to use 𝐾 = 30 , 60 and 180 for 15 𝜇𝑚 , 30 𝜇𝑚 and 90 𝜇𝑚 networks respectively . We used the time step of Δ 𝑡 = 1 min . For Figure 4 D we varied the initial actin density 𝐴 0 and the exponent 𝛼 . For illustration purposes , we also changed the parameter 𝑝 and used 𝑝 = 0 . 25 , 2 . 5 , 25 and 250 for 𝛼 = 0 . 5 , 1 , 1 . 5 and 2 respec - tively ( otherwise the obtained network lengths would diﬀer by orders of magnitudes , making the visualization less clear ) . For the simulation in main Figure 4 B we used width = 90 𝜇𝑚 , 𝛼 = 2 , 𝐴 0 = 100 𝜇𝑀 , 𝑝 = 194 𝜇𝑀 2 ∕ min , 𝑉 = 0 . 8 𝜇𝑚 / min , for the comparison shown for the net - work in Figure 4 E we used width = 15 𝜇𝑚 , 𝛼 = 2 , 𝐴 0 = 400 𝜇𝑀 , 𝑝 = 250 𝜇𝑀 2 ∕ min , 𝑉 = 1 . 5 𝜇𝑚 / min . 921 922 923 924 925 926 927 928 929 930 931 We represented the network as an undirected graph using Matlab routines , allowing to quickly determine connected components , which can be a time - consuming step . Edges that are connected to only one node can be represented as a loop , i . e . we formally connect both edge ends to the same node . Finally , if a node has two or three edges that are connected to only this node , this can be accounted for by assigning a weight of two or three to that edge . This is necessary to keep edges unique in the graph - based description . For example , a weight of two means that this edge counts twice when determining actin densities . 932 933 934 935 936 937 938 Derivation of analytical model of network fragmentation . 939 In this section we describe an analytical approximation of the network length and actin density along the network of the discrete network model of Sec . Stochastic fragmentation model : details and simulation . In the discrete network model , we describe the whole network as a collection of nodes and edges , representing branches and connecting actin ﬁlaments respectively . At its fully connected state each ( inner ) node is connected to four edges . Each nodes is being broken with a probability 𝑃 per node and time , that will depend on local properties of the network . An edge ( i . e . actin ﬁlament segment ) is removed only if either both of the nodes it is connected to are broken , or , if it is removed as part of a larger patch that is being disconnected . 940 941 942 943 944 945 946 947 948 Main Result 949 The analytical results can be summarized as follows : If the breakage rate per node is 𝑃 = 𝑐 𝐶 𝛽𝐵 𝐴 𝛼 , where 𝐶 𝐵 is the ( constant ) concentration of bound ADF / Coﬁlin in the network , 𝐴 ( 𝑦 ) is the actin density , 𝑉 is the network growth speed and 𝑐 is a dimensional constant proportionality coeﬃcient , then the equilibrium network length is given by : 𝐿 = 𝑉 𝑐 𝐴 𝛼 0 𝐶 𝛽𝐵 ∫ 1 0 ( 1 − 𝑟 2 ) 𝛼 ( 1 − 𝑟 ) ( 1 + 𝑟 ( 1− 𝑟 ) 2 ) d 𝑟 . Note that this integral is ﬁnite for any choice of 𝛼 . If 𝐴 0 is the initial actin density , then the actin density along the network in equilibrium is given by 𝐴 ( 𝑦 ) = 𝐴 0 ( 1 − 𝑟 ( 𝑦 ) 2 ) , where 𝑟 ( 𝑦 ) , the fraction of broken nodes along the network , is the solution of the ordinary diﬀerential equation : 𝑉 𝑟 ′ = 𝑐 𝐶 𝛽𝐵 𝐴 𝛼 0 1 − 𝑟 ( 1 − 𝑟 2 ) 𝛼 ( 1 + 𝑟 ( 1 − 𝑟 ) 2 ) , 𝑟 ( 0 ) = 1 . 950 951 952 953 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 961 962 963 964 965 966 28 of 34 .

It . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 437806 doi : bioRxiv preprint Manuscript submitted to eLife Derivation 967 Let 𝑁 0 be the initial number of the network nodes per area , 𝑅 - the number of the broken nodes per area , and 𝐸 - the number of the network edges per area . If initially each node was connected to four edges , then 𝐸 0 = 2 𝑁 0 . Two factors contribute to the edge removal : 968 969 970 A The current connectedness of the network ; 971 B The number of nodes that are being removed locally . 972 A : In the absence of removal of larger pieces of the network , the deletion of a node will only aﬀect edges that are connected to this very node , and only if those edges are unconnected at the other ends . The expected number of such edges for an unbroken node is : no . of edges per node × prob . that the node at the other end is broken = 4 𝑅 𝑁 0 . We model continuous densities 𝑅 and 𝐸 using the following equations : ̇𝑅 = 𝑃 ( 𝑁 0 − 𝑅 ) ( 1 + 𝑅 ∕ 𝑁 0 ( 1 − 𝑅 ∕ 𝑁 0 ) 2 ) , ( 12 ) ̇𝐸 = −4 𝑅 𝑁 0 ̇𝑅 . The second equation is simply stating that the rate of edge removal is equal to the rate of the node removal times the expected number of edges connected to the node being removed . In the ﬁrst equation , expression 𝑃 ( 𝑁 0 − 𝑅 ) accounts for the node breakage with rate 𝑃 . Factor ( 1 + 𝑅 ∕ 𝑁 0 ( 1− 𝑅 ∕ 𝑁 0 ) 2 ) in this equation accounts for the factor B : if the network connectedness is low , then per each removed node , more nodes could be removed . This factor is equal to 1 for very low density of broken nodes , and has to be an increasing function of the variable 𝑅 ∕ 𝑁 0 . Rather than using theoretical arguments to try to ﬁnd this function , we simply used a few tens of simulations of the discrete stochastic model to estimate numerically the average number of the nodes removed for each randomly removed node at any given density of the broken nodes . The function ( 1 + 𝑅 ∕ 𝑁 0 ( 1− 𝑅 ∕ 𝑁 0 ) 2 ) approximated the numerical data well for 0 < 𝑅 ∕ 𝑁 0 < 0 . 7 . For larger 𝑅 ∕ 𝑁 0 the network is already largely falling apart . We found that using more complicated functions to approximate the behavior hardly aﬀects the predictions of network length and density . 973 974 975 976 977 978 979 980 981 982 983 984 985 986 987 988 989 990 991 992 993 994 995 Adding transport eﬀects 996 We introduce the space and time dependent fraction of broken nodes 𝑟 = 𝑅 ∕ 𝑁 0 and the rescaled actin density 𝑎 = 𝐴 ∕ 𝐴 0 , and note that values of 𝐴 and 𝐸 are connected by the relation 𝐴 = 𝐸 ∕ √ 𝑁 0 , where 1∕ √ 𝑁 0 is the approximate edge length in 2D . Since both edges and nodes are being transported within the network at speed 𝑉 , we can replace Eqs . ( 12 ) by the following PDE system for densities 𝑎 ( 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) and 𝑟 ( 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) , where 𝑦 is the distance along the network : 𝜕 𝑡 𝑟 + 𝑉 𝜕 𝑦 𝑟 = 𝑃 ( 1 − 𝑟 ) ( 1 + 𝑟 ( 1 − 𝑟 ) 2 ) = ∶ 𝑃𝜌 ( 𝑟 ) , ( 13 ) 𝜕 𝑡 𝑎 + 𝑉 𝜕 𝑦 𝑎 = −2 𝑟𝜌 ( 𝑟 ) 𝑃 , with the boundary conditions 𝑎 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) = 1 , 𝑟 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) = 0 . 997 998 999 1000 1001 1002 1003 1004 1005 1006 Explicitly calculating the network equilibrium length . 1007 In equilibrium , system ( 13 ) takes the form : 𝑉 𝑟 ′ = 𝑃 ( 1 − 𝑟 ) ( 1 + 𝑟 ( 1 − 𝑟 ) 2 ) = ∶ 𝑃𝜌 ( 𝑟 ) , ( 14 ) 𝑉 𝑎 ′ = −2 𝑟𝜌 ( 𝑟 ) 𝑃 .

( 16 ) Using the separations of variables , we can rewrite Eq . ( 14 ) and ﬁnd the following equation for the equilibrium length 𝐿 : 𝑉 ∫ 𝑟 ( 𝑦 ) 0 1 𝑃𝜌 ( ̃𝑟 ) d ̃𝑟 = 𝑦 ⟹ 𝑉 ∫ 1 0 1 𝑃𝜌 ( 𝑟 ) d 𝑟 = 𝐿 . ( 17 ) The ﬁnal result depends on the choice of how the breakage rate 𝑃 depends on the actin density 𝐴 and the average amount of bound ADF / Coﬁlin 𝐶 𝐵 . We assume 𝐶 𝐵 to be constant and use the breakage rate in the form : 𝑃 = 𝑐 𝐶 𝛽𝐵 𝐴 𝛼 = 𝑐 𝐶 𝛽𝐵 ( 𝐴 0 𝑎 ) 𝛼 = 𝑐 𝐶 𝛽𝐵 𝐴 𝛼 0 1 ( 1 − 𝑟 2 ) 𝛼 , where 𝑐 is the proportionality constant . This implies that the equilibrium length is given by : 𝐿 = 𝑉 𝑐 𝐴 𝛼 0 𝐶 𝛽𝐵 ∫ 1 0 ( 1 − 𝑟 2 ) 𝛼 𝜌 ( 𝑟 ) d 𝑟 . The integral can be evaluated exactly : 𝐿 = 𝑉 𝑐 1 𝐶 𝛽𝐵 ⎧⎪⎨⎪⎩ 𝐴 0 2 𝛼 = 1 𝐴 20 27−4 √ 3 𝜋 12 𝛼 = 2 This is the formula used to compare the simulated equilibrium length to the calculated one in the main Figure 4 D . Note that , given 𝑃 , there are no free parameters , i . e . the lengths are determined exactly . As described in the main text , we used the measured equilibrium lengths , actin densities and amounts of bound ADF / Coﬁlin to determine exponents 𝛼 and 𝛽 , and found good agreement for 𝛼 = 2 , 𝛽 = 1 . This lead to main Eq . ( 5 ) and is one of the ingredients used to calculate the equilibrium length below in Sec . Equilibrium lengths of homogeneous and heterogeneous networks . 1008 1009 1010 1011 1012 1013 1014 1015 1016 1017 1018 1019 1020 1021 1022 1023 1024 1025 1026 1027 1028 1029 1030 1031 1032 1033 1034 1035 1036 1037 1038 1039 1040 1041 Equilibrium lengths of homogeneous and heterogeneous networks 1042 Homogeneous networks . 1043 First , we estimate the average amount of bound ADF / Coﬁlin 𝐶 𝐵 in a network of a given length 𝐿 . We use the estimate for the density of ADF / Coﬁlin in the solute in the vicinity of the network , derived in the main text ( Eq . ( 3 ) ) , 𝐶 𝐹 ≈ 𝐶 0 𝐷 + 𝑊 𝐿𝐶 𝐵 𝑟 𝑈 𝐷 + 𝐴𝑊 𝐿𝑟 𝐵 . Substitution of this expression into the equation for bound ADF / Coﬁlin ( Eq . ( 10 ) ) yields : 𝜕 𝑡 𝐶 𝐵 + 𝑉 𝜕 𝑦 𝐶 𝐵 = 𝜒 ( 𝐿 ) 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴𝐶 0 − 𝜒 ( 𝐿 ) 𝑟 𝑈 𝐶 𝐵 , 𝐶 𝐵 ( 𝑦 = 0 ) = 0 , where we deﬁne the depletion factor 𝜒 ( 𝐿 ) as : 𝜒 ( 𝐿 ) = 𝐷 𝐷 + 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴 0 𝐿𝑊 . 30 of 34 .

It . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 437806 doi : bioRxiv preprint Manuscript submitted to eLife For a ﬁxed network length 𝐿 , this equation can be solved for any 𝑦 ≤ 𝑉 𝑡 : 𝐶 𝐵 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴𝐶 0 𝑟 𝑈 ( 1 − 𝑒 − 𝑟𝑈𝜒 ( 𝐿 ) 𝑦 𝑉 ) . In our case , 𝑟 𝑈 ≈ 0 . 3∕min , 𝑉 ≈ 1 . 5 𝜇𝑚 ∕ 𝑚𝑖𝑛 , 𝐿 ≈ 30 𝜇𝑚 , 𝐷 ≈ 600 𝜇𝑚 2 ∕ 𝑚𝑖𝑛 , 𝐴 ≈ 100 𝜇𝑀 , 𝑟 𝐵 ≈ 0 . 5∕ 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ∕ 𝜇𝑀 , and so 𝜒 ≈ 10 −2 . Hence we approximate the amount of bound ADF / Coﬁlin by the limit 𝑟 𝑈 → 0 , yielding : 𝐶 𝐵 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴𝐶 0 𝜒 ( 𝐿 ) 𝑦 𝑉 . The average amount of bound ADF / Coﬁlin , calculated as 1 𝐿 ∫ 𝐿 0 𝐶 𝐵 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) d 𝑦 , is therefore given in Eq . ( 6 ) : 𝐶 𝐵 = 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴 0 𝐶 0 𝐿 2 𝑉 𝜒 ( 𝐿 ) .

Derivation of analytical model of network fragmentation ) and the data , we found that for a given amount of bound ADF / Coﬁlin 𝐶 𝐵 , the network length is given by : 𝐿 = 𝜅 𝑆 𝑉 ( 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴 0 ) 2 𝐶 𝐵 , ( 19 ) where 𝜅 𝑆 = 0 . 0669 𝑚𝑖𝑛 3 × 𝜇𝑀 is the proportionality constant found using ﬁtting to the data . Solving Eqs . ( 18 ) - ( 19 ) for 𝐿 and 𝐶 𝐵 gives the equilibrium length 𝐿 ∗ : 𝐿 ∗ = 𝑉 𝐶 0 𝐷 ( 𝑉 𝑊 𝜅 𝑆 ( 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴 0 ) 2 + √ [ 𝑉 𝑊 𝜅 𝑆 ( 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴 0 ) 2 ] 2 + 2 𝐷 2 𝜅 𝑆 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴 0 𝐶 0 ) . This is the formula used for all equilibrium length predictions for Figure 2 . Note that since the expression under the square root is always positive , the model predicts that the networks always reach an equilibrium length . Before the equilibrium length is reached , the length is simply given by 𝐿 = 𝑉 𝑡 , which explains the plateaus in Figure 2 B and Figure 2 D : According to the model , the networks had not yet reached equilibrium length at 𝑡 = 20 min and 𝑡 = 36 min . 1073 1074 1075 1076 1077 1078 1079 1080 1081 1082 1083 1084 1085 1086 1087 1088 1089 Heterogeneous networks . 1090 For heterogeneous networks we need to determine both equilibrium lengths 𝐿 1 , 𝐿 2 for two sub - networks , i . e . we need to formulate Eqs . ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) separately for each sub - network . We denote by 𝐴 0 , 1 and 𝐴 0 , 2 the initial actin densities at the leading edge and by 𝑉 1 and 𝑉 2 the sub - network growth speeds . Since the networks are competing for the same pool of diﬀusing ADF / Coﬁlin , we assume that there is a common depletion factor , which we denote by 𝜒 ℎ ( 𝐿 1 , 𝐿 2 ) and model by the expression : 𝜒 ℎ ( 𝐿 1 , 𝐿 2 ) = 𝐷 𝐷 + 𝑟 𝐵 𝑊 ( 𝐴 0 , 1 𝐿 1 + 𝐴 0 , 1 𝐿 2 ) , which takes into account the diﬀerent densities and network lengths . Now we replace Eq . ( 18 ) by : 𝐶 𝐵 , 1 = 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴 0 , 1 𝐶 0 𝐿 1 2 𝑉 1 𝜒 ℎ ( 𝐿 1 , 𝐿 2 ) , 𝐶 𝐵 , 2 = 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴 0 , 2 𝐶 0 𝐿 2 2 𝑉 2 𝜒 ℎ ( 𝐿 1 , 𝐿 2 ) , ( 20 ) and Eq .

We ﬁnd the relation 𝐿 1 𝑉 1 √ 𝐴 0 , 1 = 𝐿 2 𝑉 2 √ 𝐴 0 , 2 , which helps to simplify the equations . The ﬁnal result can be written as : 𝐿 ∗1 = 𝑉 1 𝐶 0 𝐷 ( 𝑉 1 𝑊 𝜅 𝑆 ( 𝑟 𝐵 ̃𝐴 12 ) 2 + √ [ 𝑉 1 𝑊 𝜅 𝑆 ( 𝑟 𝐵 ̃𝐴 12 ) 2 ] 2 + 2 𝐷 2 𝜅 𝑆 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴 0 , 1 𝐶 0 ) , 𝐿 ∗2 = 𝑉 2 𝐶 0 𝐷 ( 𝑉 2 𝑊 𝜅 𝑆 ( 𝑟 𝐵 ̃𝐴 21 ) 2 + √ [ 𝑉 2 𝑊 𝜅 𝑆 ( 𝑟 𝐵 ̃𝐴 21 ) 2 ] 2 + 2 𝐷 2 𝜅 𝑆 𝑟 𝐵 𝐴 0 , 2 𝐶 0 ) , where we have deﬁned the terms ̃𝐴 𝑖𝑗 as : ̃𝐴 2 𝑖𝑗 = 𝐴 20 , 𝑖 + 𝑉 𝑗 𝑉 𝑖 𝐴 0 , 𝑗 √ 𝐴 0 , 𝑖 𝐴 0 , 𝑗 . The expressions for the equilibrium lengths are very similar to the homogeneous network case – in fact if 𝑉 1 = 𝑉 2 and 𝐴 0 , 1 = 𝐴 0 , 2 , they simplify to the case of one single network with width 2 𝑊 . 1091 1092 1093 1094 1095 1096 1097 1098 1099 1100 1101 1102 1103 1104 1105 1106 1107 1108 1109 1110 1111 1112 1113 1114 1115 1116 1117 1118 1119 1120 1121 1122 1123 1124 Modeling the shape of heterogeneous networks . 1125 Modeling . 1126 In this section we model the shape of a network consisting of two sub - networks having diﬀerent actin densities and / or growth speeds . We start by assuming that their material properties are constant along the network . We denote by 𝑉 1 > 𝑉 2 the growth speeds of sub - networks 1 and 2 respectively . As the network assembles , two sub - networks are eﬀectively ‘glued’ together . In our simple model , we assume the sub - networks to be elastic . We model each sub - network segment by two springs , placed at a distance 𝑊 ( the network width ) from each other ( App . Fig . 2 ) . The springs at the interface Γ between the sub - networks are connected and forced to have the same length ( representing the ‘glued’ together condition ) . The diﬀerences in sub - network growth speeds lead to diﬀerent resting lengths 𝑙 1 and 𝑙 2 , proportional to the respective speeds . To account for elastic eﬀects , we assume that the diﬀerences in density lead to diﬀerent elastic moduli 𝐸 1 and 𝐸 2 , and hence to diﬀerent spring constants 𝑘 1 ∝ 𝐸 1 ∕ 𝑙 1 and 𝑘 2 ∝ 𝐸 2 ∕ 𝑙 2 . We call the length of the outermost and innermost spring 𝐿 1 and 𝐿 2 respectively ; the length of the two springs at the interface therefore has to be ( 𝐿 1 + 𝐿 2 ) ∕2 . 1127 1128 1129 1130 1131 1132 1133 1134 1135 1136 1137 1138 1139 1140 L 1 L 2 W network 1 network 2 restlength l 1 spring constant k 1 restlength l 2 spring constant k 2 W Γ A B 1141 Appendix 1 Figure 2 .

Minimization with respect to 𝐿 1 and 𝐿 2 gives : 𝐿 1 = 𝑙 1 + 𝑘 2 ( 𝑘 1 − 𝑘 2 ) 𝛿 ( 𝑙 1 − 𝑙 2 ) , 𝐿 2 = 𝑙 2 + 𝑘 1 ( 𝑘 1 − 𝑘 2 ) 𝛿 ( 𝑙 1 − 𝑙 2 ) , where 𝛿 = 𝑘 21 + 6 𝑘 1 𝑘 2 + 𝑘 22 . Using the basic proportionality theorem of elementary geometry of triangles , we ﬁnd that the radius of curvature of the interface curve Γ , expressed as the reciprocal of the curvature 𝜅 , has to be : 1 𝜅 = 𝑊 𝐿 1 + 𝐿 2 𝐿 1 − 𝐿 2 = 𝑊 ( 𝑙 1 + 𝑙 2 𝑙 1 − 𝑙 2 + ( 𝑘 1 − 𝑘 2 ) ( 𝑘 1 𝑙 1 − 𝑘 2 𝑙 2 ) 4 𝑘 1 𝑘 2 ( 𝑙 1 − 𝑙 2 ) ) . To simplify interpretation , we denote by 𝜎 = 𝐸 2 ∕ 𝐸 1 the ratio of the elastic moduli and we use expressions : 𝑙 1 = 𝑉 1 Δ 𝑡 , 𝑙 2 = 𝑉 2 Δ 𝑡 , where Δ 𝑡 is the time step . This gives : 1 𝜅 = 𝑊 ( 𝑉 1 + 𝑉 2 𝑉 1 − 𝑉 2 + ( 𝜎 − 1 ) 𝑉 1 𝜎 − 𝑉 2 4 𝜎 ( 𝑉 1 − 𝑉 2 ) ) . The speed of the interface is given by : 𝑉 ℎ = 𝐿 1 + 𝐿 2 2Δ 𝑡 = 𝑉 1 + 𝑉 2 2 − ( 𝑉 1 − 𝑉 2 ) ( 𝑉 21 𝜎 2 − 𝑉 22 ) 2 ( 𝑉 21 𝜎 2 + 6 𝑉 1 𝑉 2 𝜎 + 𝑉 22 ) . These are the formulas used to calculate the curves shown in Figure 6 B , C in the main text . Note that : ∞ 𝜎 → 0 ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←← 1 𝜅 𝜎 → ∞ ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←→ ∞ 𝑉 1 𝜎 → 0 ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←← 𝑣 ℎ 𝜎 → ∞ ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←→ 𝑉 2 . In other words , if one of the sub - networks is much stiﬀer that the other one , the heteroge - neous network will become straight and grow with the speed of the stiﬀer sub - network . 1147 1148 1149 1150 1151 1152 1153 1154 1155 1156 1157 1158 1159 1160 1161 1162 1163 1164 1165 1166 1167 1168 1169 1170 1171 1172 1173 1174 1175 1176 1177 Sub - network shapes . 1178 Since our discussion so far concerned local properties of the sub - networks , we can account for changes in density along the combined network simply by making the elasticity ratio 𝜎 , and hence the curvature 𝜅 , a function of arc length along the network 𝑠 . Then , curve Γ ( 𝑠 ) at the interface of the two sub - networks can be parametrized as 𝑠 ↦ Γ ( 𝑠 ) = ( Γ 1 ( 𝑠 ) , Γ 2 ( 𝑠 ) ) ( App . Fig . 2 ) , where : Γ 1 ( 𝑠 ) = ∫ 𝑦 0 sin ( ∫ 𝑧 0 𝜅 ( 𝑤 ) d 𝑤 ) d 𝑧 , Γ 2 ( 𝑠 ) = ∫ 𝑦 0 cos ( ∫ 𝑧 0 𝜅 ( 𝑤 ) d 𝑤 ) d 𝑧 . In case of constant material properties along each sub - network ( as shown in Figure 6 A in the main text ) , these expressions simplify to : Γ 1 ( 𝑠 ) = 1 − cos ( 𝜅𝑠 ) 𝜅 , Γ 2 ( 𝑠 ) = sin ( 𝜅𝑠 ) 𝜅 . If actin densities vary along the sub - network , we can use the analytical approximation of the discrete model for network fragmentation described in Sec . Derivation of analytical model of network fragmentation . In particular , we have to solve Eq . ( 14 ) to obtain the density of 33 of 34 .

( 16 ) to obtain a formula for the actin density along the sub - network . To simplify the results , we use the following approximation of Eq . ( 14 ) : 𝑉 𝑟 ′ = 𝑐 𝐶 𝐵 𝐴 20 1 ( 1 − 𝑟 ) 2 . ( 22 ) Using the notation introduced above in Sec . Equilibrium lengths of homogeneous and heterogeneous networks and the calculated equilibrium lengths 𝐿 ∗1 and 𝐿 ∗2 , we obtain : 𝑟 1 ( 𝑠 ) = 1 − ( 1 − 𝑠 ∕ 𝐿 ∗1 ) 1∕3 , 𝐴 1 ( 𝑠 ) = 𝐴 0 , 1 ( 1 − 𝑟 21 ( 𝑠 ) ) , 𝑠 < 𝐿 ∗1 𝑟 2 ( 𝑠 ) = 1 − ( 1 − 𝑠 ∕ 𝐿 ∗2 ) 1∕3 , 𝐴 2 ( 𝑠 ) = 𝐴 0 , 2 ( 1 − 𝑟 22 ( 𝑠 ) ) , 𝑠 < 𝐿 ∗2 . Since 𝐿 ∗1 > 𝐿 ∗2 , we can approximate the elasticity ratio of the two sub - networks as : 𝜎 ( 𝑠 ) = ⎧⎪⎨⎪⎩ ( 𝐴 2 ( 𝑠 ) 𝐴 1 ( 𝑠 ) ) 2 . 5 𝑦 ∈ [ 0 , 𝐿 ∗2 ] , ∞ elsewise . ( 23 ) These are the formulas used to calculate the network shapes shown in Figure 6 E in the main text .
