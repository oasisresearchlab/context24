Louis , United States Abstract The ESCRT machinery along with the AAA + ATPase Vps4 drive membrane scission for trafficking into multivesicular bodies in the endocytic pathway and for the topologically related processes of viral budding and cytokinesis , but how they accomplish this remains unclear . Using deep - etch electron microscopy , we find that endogenous ESCRT - III filaments stabilized by depleting cells of Vps4 create uniform membrane - deforming conical spirals which are assemblies of specific ESCRT - III heteropolymers . To explore functional roles for ESCRT - III filaments , we examine HIV - 1 Gag - mediated budding of virus - like particles and find that depleting Vps4 traps ESCRT - III filaments around nascent Gag assemblies . Interpolating between the observed structures suggests a new role for Vps4 in separating ESCRT - III from Gag or other cargo to allow centripetal growth of a neck constricting ESCRT - III spiral . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 02184 . 001 Introduction Vesicle formation requires machinery to identify cargo , deform the membrane and release a vesicle . How cytoplasmic proteins cooperate to form vesicles that mediate transport between organelles is well defined . Less well understood is how cytoplasmic proteins drive the topologically reverse process of creating intralumenal vesicles ( ILVs ) in multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) . Studies over the past decade have shown that a set of over 30 proteins are responsible for ILV formation and are also required for the topologically similar processes of viral budding and cytokinesis ( Hurley , 2010 ; Hanson and Cashikar , 2012 ; Sundquist and Krausslich , 2012 ; Henne et al . , 2013 ; McCullough et al . , 2013 ) . Most are components of ESCRT ( endosomal sorting complex required for transport ) complexes . The multisubunit ESCRT - 0 , - I , and - II complexes are thought to recognize cargo and initiate vesicle formation , while ESCRT - III proteins and the AAA + ATPase Vps4 that acts on them promote membrane remodeling and scission both on MVBs and the plasma membrane . A subject of much current interest is how , exactly , ESCRT - III and Vps4 drive these events . Seven ESCRT - III proteins in yeast and 12 in humans are structurally similar to each other but are not redundant for pathway function ( Morita et al . , 2010 , 2011 ; Peel et al . , 2011 ) . ESCRT - III proteins cycle between an inactive or closed monomeric state in the cytoplasm and an activated or open state in which they polymerize into filaments on the membrane ( Babst et al . , 2002 ; Lin et al . , 2005 ; Zamborlini et al . , 2006 ; Shim et al . , 2007 ; Hanson et al . , 2008 ) . ESCRT - II initiates ESCRT - III assembly on the MVB by binding to Vps20 / CHMP6 ( Babst et al . , 2002 ; Teis et al . , 2010 ) while virally encoded sequence motifs bind ESCRT - I and / or Alix which in turn promote ESCRT - III assembly during viral bud - ding ( von Schwedler et al . , 2003 ; Strack et al . , 2003 ) . Once nucleated , ESCRT - III polymers grow by recruiting other subunits ( Babst et al . , 2002 ; Shim et al . , 2007 ; Teis et al . , 2008 ; Saksena et al . , 2009 ) . Reconstituting ILV formation on giant unilamellar vesicles established that ESCRT - III pro - teins alone can promote vesicle release ( Wollert et al . , 2009 ; Wollert and Hurley , 2010 ) although studies in yeast suggest that they normally do this in cooperation with Vps4 ( Nickerson et al . , 2010 ; * For correspondence : phanson22 @ WUSTL .

RESEARCH ARTICLE Cell biology Cashikar et al . eLife 2014 ; 3 : e02184 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 02184 2 of 17 Research article Adell et al . , 2014 ) . In addition to Vps20 / CHMP6 as a nucleator , specific roles attributed to individual ESCRT - III proteins include cargo confinement by Snf7 / CHMP4 ( Teis et al . , 2008 ) , polymer capping by Vps24 / CHMP3 ( Saksena et al . , 2009 ) , and Vps4 recruitment by Vps2 / CHMP2 and Did2 / CHMP1 ( Lata et al . , 2008 ; Saksena et al . , 2009 ; Davies et al . , 2010 ; Adell et al . , 2014 ) . ESCRT - III polymers are remodeled and disassembled by the AAA ATPase Vps4 before ( Nickerson et al . , 2010 ; Baumgartel et al . , 2011 ; Jouvenet et al . , 2011 ; Adell et al . , 2014 ) and / or after ( Wollert et al . , 2009 ; Wollert and Hurley , 2010 ) membrane scission , returning individual subunits to their closed state in the cytoplasm . Structural studies demonstrate that ESCRT - III proteins each consist of a ∼ 7 nm helical hairpin ( α 1 – α 2 ) stabilized and regulated by four or more short helices ( α 3 – α 6 ) ( Muziol et al . , 2006 ; Bajorek et al . , 2009 ; Xiao et al . , 2009 ; Martinelli et al . , 2012 ) . α 5 – α 6 and surrounding sequences are responsible for autoinhibition and thereby regulate membrane binding and polymer assembly ( Zamborlini et al . , 2006 ; Shim et al . , 2007 ; Bajorek et al . , 2009 ) . In their active or open state , ESCRT - III proteins polym - erize in vitro and in vivo using a number of different protein – protein interfaces ( Muziol et al . , 2006 ; Ghazi - Tabatabai et al . , 2008 ; Bajorek et al . , 2009 ; Xiao et al . , 2009 ; Morita et al . , 2011 ) . Snf7 / CHMP4 is the most abundant ESCRT - III protein , and forms membrane - associated polymers in vitro and in transfected cells ( Hanson et al . , 2008 ; Teis et al . , 2008 ; Fyfe et al . , 2011 ; Henne et al . , 2012 ) . Electron microscopy ( EM ) shows that Snf7 / CHMP4 polymers are curved filaments < 5 nm in diameter ( Ghazi - Tabatabai et al . , 2008 ; Hanson et al . , 2008 ; Pires et al . , 2009 ; Henne et al . , 2012 ) . Other ESCRT - III proteins shown to assemble in vitro into a variety of mostly tubular structures include CHMP2A and CHMP3 ( Lata et al . , 2008 ; Bajorek et al . , 2009 ; Dobro et al . , 2013 ; Effantin et al . , 2013 ) , CHMP1B ( Bajorek et al . , 2009 ; Dobro et al . , 2013 ) , CHMP2B ( Bodon et al . , 2011 ) , and Ist1 ( Bajorek et al . , 2009 ; Dobro et al . , 2013 ) . Finally , ∼ 17 nm filaments on the membrane in intercellular eLife digest Cells contain compartments called organelles that are enclosed within membranes similar to the plasma membrane that surrounds the cell itself . Cells police the proteins on their membranes and move old or damaged proteins into a type of organelle called an endosome . This involves the membrane folding in on itself to form a multivesicular body . The multivesicular bodies deliver their contents to organelles called lysosomes where the old proteins are destroyed . Although it is known that over 30 proteins are involved in the formation of multivesicular bodies , many aspects of how they operate are not well understood . Moreover , disruptions to this process contribute to a large number of diseases including forms of cancer and neurodegeneration . Importantly , the same proteins are hijacked by viruses such as HIV to help them escape from the cells they have infected . Most of the proteins involved in forming multivesicular bodies are part of the ESCRT ( Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport ) system of proteins . A special set of these proteins— ESCRT - III—is thought to cut the membrane to release vesicles and viruses , as well as helping the membrane to deform . Previously , researchers have been unsure how the ESCRT - III complex works because it has a short lifespan and is too small to see on cellular membranes using standard techniques . Now Cashikar , Shim et al . have used a technique called deep - etch electron microscopy in combination with gene knockdown strategies to reveal the structure of the ESCRT - III complex inside cells . A protein called Vps4 is known to recycle ESCRT - III complexes , so Cashikar , Shim et al . studied cells in which the levels of Vps4 had been depleted in order to increase the lifespan of ESCRT - III complexes . In these cells filaments made of ESCRT - III complexes tended to form conical spirals that matched the size and shape of the vesicles and viruses ESCRT - III is thought to produce . ESCRT - III filaments also accumulated as rings around the molecules destined for incorporation into a vesicle or virus . This indicated a new role for Vps4 : it separates ESCRT - III from the contents of the vesicle , leaving it free to form a spiral that drives release of the vesicle or virus from the cell . The next challenge will be to test the predictions of this model using techniques that can capture individual vesicle formation events in real time . Understanding the function of ESCRT - III in greater detail may suggest ways to manipulate this pathway to limit the replication of viruses or the degradation of membrane proteins .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 02184 3 of 17 Research article bridges before cytokinesis disappear when CHMP2A is missing , suggesting that they too might represent a form of ESCRT - III polymer ( Guizetti et al . , 2011 ) . These many views of ESCRT - III have led to proposals for how it and Vps4 contribute to membrane scission during ILV formation , viral budding , and cytokinesis ( Fabbro et al . , 2005 ; Lenz et al . , 2009 ; Saksena et al . , 2009 ; Wollert et al . , 2009 ; Elia et al . , 2012 ; Henne et al . , 2013 ; McCullough et al . , 2013 ) . However , much remains to be learned about the assembly and functional roles of different types of ESCRT - III polymers in their own right and in conjunction with Vps4 . For insight into ESCRT - III polymer structure in a physiological setting , we examined endogenous machinery in cultured mammalian cells by deep - etch EM . We find that ESCRT - III heteropolymers sta - bilized by depleting Vps4A & B are membrane - attached filaments that frequently spiral to delineate and fill circular domains ∼ 110 nm in diameter . Many of these spirals induce conical deformations directed away from the cytoplasm . Filaments built from transfected proteins show that coassembly of two ESCRT - III proteins ( in this case Snf7 / CHMP4A and CHMP2A ) is required to create membrane deforming ESCRT - III spirals . To define the relationship between ESCRT - III filaments and cargo , we studied HIV - 1 Gag - driven virus - like - particle ( VLP ) assembly . Notably , in cells depleted of Vps4 , we find that Gag assemblies are often encircled by ESCRT - III filaments . This suggests a previously unappreciated role for Vps4 in remodeling ESCRT - III around cargo - containing membrane domains in addition to its more canonical role in recycling ESCRT - III subunits . Results and discussion Depleting Vps4 in mammalian cells traps ESCRT - III polymers on membranes Endogenous ESCRT - III proteins including CHMP4A and CHMP2B are diffusely localized in cells with little steady - state concentration on endosomes despite their known role in lumenal vesicle formation ( Figure 1A , left panels ) . This is not surprising given measurements in live cells showing that both they and Vps4 are present for a few minutes or less at their site of action during viral particle release ( Baumgartel et al . , 2011 ; Jouvenet et al . , 2011 ) or cytokinetic abscission ( Elia et al . , 2012 ) . To visu - alize ESCRT - III , we therefore set out to increase the lifetime of membrane associated polymers taking advantage of the known role for Vps4 in mediating disassembly and recycling of ESCRT - III ( Babst et al . , 1998 ; Lin et al . , 2005 ) . Depleting Vps4A & B , the two Vps4 proteins present in human cells , by RNAi ( Figure 1B ) caused ESCRT - III proteins to redistribute onto puncta localized throughout the cell ( Figure 1A , middle panels ) . Sedimentation of detergent solubilized cell extracts further demon - strated that a significant fraction of ESCRT - III proteins accumulated in the detergent insoluble fraction characteristic of polymerized ESCRT - III ( Figure 1C ; Shim et al . , 2007 ) . Deep - etch EM is particularly well suited to examining the morphology of the plasma membrane ( Heuser , 2000 ) , and although many ESCRT - III puncta were on endosome like structures throughout the cytoplasm , a subset appeared at the edge of the cell and remained associated with unroofed plasma membranes ( Figure 1A , right panels ) . Their presence could reflect a role for ESCRT - III in creat - ing outwardly - directed vesicles known as ectosomes that bud from the plasma membrane ( Stein and Luzio , 1991 ; Nabhan et al . , 2012 ; Choudhuri et al . , 2014 ; Jimenez et al . , 2014 ) . Alternatively , ESCRT - III puncta could be transferred to the plasma membrane by MVB exocytosis ( Thery , 2011 ) . Finally , ESCRT - III may have some other , potentially structural , role on the plasma membrane . Importantly , the acces - sibility of the plasma membrane to deep - etch EM provided us with a starting point for studying the structure of cellular ESCRT - III . Endogenous ESCRT - III polymers form conical spirals Deep - etch EM of plasma membranes from cultured cells depleted of Vps4A & B revealed unique fila - mentous assemblies intermingled among otherwise typical cytoskeletal structures , clathrin lattices , and caveolae ( Figure 2A ) . The new filaments were attached to the membrane and most clearly recog - nized in discrete spirals that often deformed the membrane into conical protrusions . Because these filaments resemble previously described ESCRT - III polymers , we used antibodies recognizing several ESCRT - III proteins and found that gold particles marking each of the proteins examined ( CHMP6 , CHMP2B , and CHMP1B ) bound on or near filaments and filament spirals but not elsewhere on membranes from cells depleted of Vps4A & B ( Figure 2B ) or on membranes from control HeLa cells ( not shown ) . Fortuitous immunodecoration inside broken but not fully unroofed Vps4 - depleted cells Cell biology Cashikar et al . eLife 2014 ; 3 : e02184 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 02184 4 of 17 Research article showed that eversions containing ESCRT - III were also present along the cell ' s top surface ( Figure 2— figure supplement 1 ) . The apparent distribution of different ESCRT - III proteins on the filament spirals was similar ( Figure 2B and not shown ) , although generally predominant labeling near the perimeter may reflect limited epitope accessibility toward the center of the spirals . This immunodecoration argues against unique positioning of particular ESCRT - III proteins along the filaments , although higher Figure 1 . Effects of depleting Vps4 on ESCRT - III .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 02184 5 of 17 Research article resolution studies and additional antibodies will be required to determine exactly where different ESCRT - III proteins are present in each spiral . The most striking and unexpected characteristic of these stabilized ESCRT - III filaments was their frequent organization into spirals ( Figure 3A , B ) . Other patterns including partial or complete rings and meandering filaments were also seen but were less common . The overall diameter of the spiral assemblies was 108 ± 30 nm ( Figure 3C ) , with an average of four 360° turns in each spiral . The shape of the spirals on the membrane varied , ranging from clearly conical to flat . The total length of the filament in each spiral was 660 ± 350 nm . While Vps4 - driven remodeling may normally keep fila - ments from reaching this length ( Teis et al . , 2008 ) , these images set an upper limit on the size and shape of endogenous ESCRT - III polymer that is smaller and more uniform than that of the exten - sive polymers seen in vitro ( Lata et al . , 2008 ; Bajorek et al . , 2009 ; Henne et al . , 2012 ) or in cells Figure 2 .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 02184 6 of 17 Research article overexpressing specific components of ESCRT - III ( Hanson et al . , 2008 ; Bodon et al . , 2011 ) . ESCRT - III assembly must therefore be controlled by something other than the availability of subunits . One pos - sibility is that centripetal growth of a membrane - attached filament determines the diameter of the final assembly . Interestingly , ESCRT - III spirals surround and cover an area of membrane that corre - sponds well with that needed to generate a vesicle ∼ 50 nm in diameter—the typical size of ILVs in mammalian cells ( Murk et al . , 2003 ) —suggesting that an initial ESCRT - III circle might define the con - tent of an incipient vesicle . For insight into how ESCRT - III filaments grow on the membrane , we asked if they preferentially spiral in one direction or the other . Surprisingly , we found both left - and right - handed spirals even in the same field of view ( Figure 3 ) . This was true both for obviously conical and flat spirals . Even without knowing precisely how subunits are arranged within the filaments , it is clear that changes along the spiral have the potential to affect positioning of functionally important motifs in the ESCRT - III proteins . For example , changes in the recently described N - terminal membrane insertion motif ( Buchkovich et al . , 2013 ) could contribute to membrane deformation . Figure 3 .

( D ) Distribution of filament widths measured at three points per spiral . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 02184 . 006 Cell biology Cashikar et al . eLife 2014 ; 3 : e02184 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 02184 7 of 17 Research article The apparent diameter of the finest filaments in ESCRT - III spirals was ∼ 4 nm ( Figure 3D ) . Because individual ESCRT - III proteins contain a ∼ 7 nm helical hairpin that is 3 – 4 nm wide ( Muziol et al . , 2006 ; Bajorek et al . , 2009 ; Xiao et al . , 2009 ; Martinelli et al . , 2012 ) , their assembly into filaments must involve interactions along an approximately longitudinal axis as previously envisioned for filaments and tubes assembled in vitro ( Lata et al . , 2008 ; Henne et al . , 2012 ; Dobro et al . , 2013 ; Effantin et al . , 2013 ) . Filament width varied from 4 to as much as 15 nm in both conical and flat spirals ( Figure 3D ) , excluding differences in accessibility to platinum deposition as a primary cause of the differences . Instead , differences in platinum decoration are likely to reveal variations in molecular structure ( Bachmann et al . , 1985 ) . Wider filaments—sometimes with a split down their middle suggesting the presence of parallel substrands—were most prevalent at the perimeter while thin filaments occurred throughout but were almost always present near the spirals ' center . Filaments sometimes abruptly changed width ( see examples highlighted in Figure 3A ) further supporting the presence of subfilaments within wider structures . Given the functional requirement for two ESCRT - III nucleating sites in ESCRT - II ( Teis et al . , 2010 ) or Alix ( Pires et al . , 2009 ) , one possibility is that parallel filaments create the outer turns of a spiral but give way to single filaments with the potential for tighter curvature near the spiral ' s center . The ability of specific ESCRT - III proteins to cap filament assembly ( Teis et al . , 2008 ) could promote transition from wide to narrow filaments by ending one of two ( or more ) parallel filaments . Understanding the functional significance and control of differences in filament content and shape will be an impor - tant question for the future . Coassembly of CHMP4A with other ESCRT - III proteins creates membrane - deforming filaments We next wondered what it is about endogenous ESCRT - III filaments that promotes their assembly into stereotyped membrane - deforming spirals . While deep - etch EM does not have the resolution to define the arrangement of individual subunits , it allows us to compare filament shape and organization to that of filaments assembled in transfected cells . We previously found that overexpressed FLAG - tagged CHMP4 proteins create extensive networks of interconnected curved but flat filaments ( Hanson et al . , 2008 ) and others have seen that CHMP4B and yeast Snf7 behave similarly in vitro ( Pires et al . , 2009 ; Henne et al . , 2012 ) . To rule out any effects of the acidic FLAG - tag at the N - terminus of CHMP4A in our earlier study ( Hanson et al . , 2008 ) , we examined filaments formed by untagged CHMP4A ( Figure 4A ) . This was important because the FLAG - tag might specifically interfere with a recently described N - terminal membrane insertion motif in CHMP4 - family proteins ( Buchkovich et al . , 2013 ) . As before , CHMP4A filaments circle and spiral along the membrane to form an anastomosing network but do not couple this to changes in membrane shape ( Figure 4A ) . CHMP4A filaments also remain flat when built from a constitutively ‘open’ CHMP4 ( α 1 – α 5 ) truncation mutant ( Shim et al . , 2007 ; Figure 4B ) or a K52E mutant that enhances Snf7 assembly in yeast ( Henne et al . , 2012 ) ( not shown ) . These consistently flat networks indicate that interface ( s ) needed to deform the membrane are either not present or not exposed in CHMP4 homopolymers even when intramolecular autoinhibitory contacts are released . Given that ESCRT - III function in cellular events requires more than one ESCRT - III protein ( Babst et al . , 2002 ; Morita et al . , 2010 , 2011 ) , we hypothesized that coassembly of CHMP4 with additional ESCRT - III proteins might be required to create filaments with the shape of the endogenous filaments above . To test this idea , we examined the effect of coexpressing CHMP4A with CHMP2A based on the fact that the ESCRT - III function in a wide variety of pathways and organisms requires members of both the CHMP4 and CHMP2 subfamilies of proteins ( Babst et al . , 2002 ; Morita et al . , 2010 , 2011 ) . Previous biochemical analyses showed that full - length CHMP4A and CHMP2A do not efficiently coassemble while heteropolymers form readily when either protein is activated by deleting its autoinhibitory domain ( Shim et al . , 2007 ) . Strikingly , membranes from cells co - expressing ‘open’ CHMP4A ( α 1 – α 5 ) and full - length CHMP2A were studded with eversions lined by spiraling filaments ( Figure 4C ) . Corresponding eversions were apparent protruding from the tops of whole cells ( Figure 4D ) ; underlying filaments were revealed by delipidating fixed samples with detergent ( Figure 4E ) . Similar membrane - deforming filaments developed when we coexpressed full - length CHMP4A with ‘open’ CHMP2A ( α 1 – α 5 ) ( not shown ) , demonstrating that the shape changes do not depend on C - terminal autoinhibitory sequences in either protein . The fact that ESCRT - III heteropolymers differ from the sum of their parts supports a model in which subunits such as CHMP2A coassemble with CHMP4 to change the structure of the filament and its effects on membrane shape . Similar changes in filament morphology were previously seen with purified proteins in vitro ( Henne et al . , 2012 ) suggesting that distinctive Cell biology Cashikar et al . eLife 2014 ; 3 : e02184 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 02184 8 of 17 Research article heteropolymer shape may be a general feature of ESCRT - III biology . An important question for the future will be to define how recruitment and assembly of appropriate ESCRT - III subunits is regulated to create the requisite polymer shape . ESCRT - III filaments surround nascent HIV - 1 Gag assemblies A challenge in thinking about the function of ESCRT - III spirals trapped by depleting Vps4 ( Figures 2 and 3 ) is that they are typically not in contact with nascent or released vesicles . If spirals represent ‘scars’ left behind after vesicle budding , they have separated from the vesicles they helped to create . An alternative possibility is that spirals represent the preferred arrangement of ESCRT - III when it assembles spontaneously as a ‘blank’ in the absence of cargo ( and Vps4 ) . Efforts to see ESCRT - III spirals on the surface of endosomes where their function in vesicle biogenesis is better defined were complicated by poor retention and accessibility of these organelles to deep - etch EM as well as the development of stacked class E compartments similar to those seen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Nickerson et al . , 2006 , and not shown ) . We therefore turned to the best - characterized ESCRT - dependent event at the plasma membrane , Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV - 1 ) budding . HIV - 1 assembly is driven by polymerization of the virally encoded Gag polyprotein , which recruits cellular ESCRT proteins to facilitate virion release from the plasma membrane and can be expressed alone to produce virus - like particles ( VLPs ) ( Gheysen et al . , 1989 ; Karacostas et al . , 1989 ; Sundquist and Krausslich , 2012 ) . Current thinking based on electron tomography of immature virions ( Wright et al . , 2007 ; Carlson et al . , 2008 ; Briggs et al . , 2009 ) and bud sites ( Carlson et al . , 2008 ) is that ESCRTs and especially ESCRT - III play important roles both in completing the viral sphere ( that is only 2 / 3 covered Figure 4 .

ESCRT - III and Vps4 are transiently recruited to Gag assemblies to mediate release ( Jouvenet et al . , 2011 ) . This machinery is typically thought to act on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane to constrict the vesicle neck and release a viral particle ( Sundquist and Krausslich , 2012 ) , although a recent study using fluorescently labeled proteins and superresolution imaging raised the possibility of similar constriction from within the viral particle ( Van Engelenburg et al . , 2014 ) . Using deep - etch EM allows us to capture snapshots of this process while assessing the relationship between ESCRT - III and HIV - 1 Gag as a readily recogniz - able cargo . HEK293T cells transiently expressing HIV - 1 Gag ( Figure 5 ) or Gag - GFP ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) produce abundant VLPs that are readily apparent by deep - etch EM both on and around cells as well as beneath unroofed plasma membranes ( Figure 5A – C ) . Release of VLPs was corroborated by fluores - cence microscopy of cells expressing Gag - GFP ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) and by isolation and immunoblotting of VLPs ( not shown ) . Unroofed plasma membranes display unique circular and semi - spherical protein assemblies ranging in size up to the diameter of VLPs that appear to be nascent Gag assemblies ( Figure 5D ) . In order to ascertain that these in fact contain Gag , we immunodecorated unroofed cells with an antibody specific to the membrane - proximal matrix ( MA ) domain of Gag ( Figure 5E – H ) . Gold particles were numerous around putative Gag assemblies on unroofed plasma Figure 5 . Deep - etch EM of HIV - 1 VLP budding .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 02184 . 009 Cell biology Cashikar et al . eLife 2014 ; 3 : e02184 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 02184 10 of 17 Research article membranes ( Figure 5E , E ′ ) and around VLPs ( Figure 5F , F ′ ) when samples were delipidated by detergent extraction after fixation . When membranes were intact , immunodecoration of Gag assemblies was limited to their perimeter ( Figure 5G , G ′ ) and was abolished in released VLPs ( Figure 5H ) as expected . By deep - etch EM , Gag - GFP assemblies were less uniform in size and shape than those containing Gag ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ) , consistent with the irregular distribution of Gag - GFP seen by thin section EM ( Pornillos et al . , 2003 ) and with the decreased Gag content of VLPs containing Gag fused to similarly sized fluorescent proteins ( Gunzenhauser et al . , 2012 ) . Notably there was no evidence by direct viewing or immunolabeling ( not shown ) to indicate the presence of ESCRT - III on or near any of these Gag assemblies . This is not surprising given live cell studies showing that ESCRT - III and Vps4 are only transiently recruited after Gag assembly is essentially complete ( Baumgartel et al . , 2011 ; Jouvenet et al . , 2011 ) . To explore the role of ESCRT - III filaments in VLP biogenesis , we therefore once again depleted cells of Vps4 to stabilize ESCRT - III in its assembled state . As expected , expressing a dominant negative mutant of Vps4A ( Vps4A E228Q ) or silencing Vps4 as above increased the amount of Gag - GFP ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ) or Gag ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1B ) on the plasma mem - brane and decreased release of VLPs as detected by particle analysis methods ( data not shown ) . Strikingly , in cells lacking Vps4 Gag assemblies on the plasma membrane were now often surrounded by a single filament not seen in control cells ( Figure 6 ) . The encircling filaments appeared similar to the ESCRT - III filaments examined above , each ranging from 4 . 5 – 12 . 8 nm ( average 8 . 6 ± 1 . 6 nm , n = 96 ) in width with the majority wide enough to contain more than one ∼ 4 nm substrand . Immunolabeling confirmed that ESCRT - III proteins localized to the perimeter of Gag assemblies coincident with the fila - ments ( Figure 6D ) . Interestingly , the encircling filaments surrounded Gag assemblies of various sizes ranging from ∼ 60 – 150 nm suggesting that the threshold amount of Gag needed to activate ESCRT - III assembly may be decreased in the setting of reduced Vps4 leading to premature nucleation of the ESCRT - III ring . Alternatively , these smaller Gag assemblies may indicate a role for ESCRT - III filaments in confining Gag ( or other cargo proteins ) in a domain that normally expands upon remodeling by Vps4 . More deeply invaginated Gag assemblies were sometimes surrounded by what appeared to be tightly spiraled ESCRT - III filaments , and immunolabeling confirmed that ESCRT - III was present on the cytoplasmic rim and surrounding surface of these invaginating VLPs ( Figure 6D , right panel and not shown ) . These spirals may correspond to the darkly stained ring previously noted in thin section EM analysis of HIV - 1 budding from cells depleted of CHMP2A ( and therefore unable to engage Vps4 ) ( Morita et al . , 2011 ) and seem likely to represent trapped intermediates in the biogenesis of VLPs . How do Gag assemblies recruit ESCRT - III filaments ? We noticed that ESCRT - III filaments ( in cells depleted of Vps4 ) were frequently connected to the central Gag assembly by perpendicular ‘struts’ ∼ 14 nm long ( Figure 6 , see green highlighting in inset ) . These struts resemble previous negative stain images of purified Alix bound perpendicularly to Snf7 filaments ( Pires et al . , 2009 ) although based on size they could also correspond to ESCRT - I ( Boura et al . , 2011 ) , an ESCRT - I - ESCRT - II supercomplex ( Boura et al . , 2012 ) , or something else altogether . The C - terminal p6 domain of Gag contains a PTAP motif ( essential for interaction with the ESCRT - I protein Tsg101 [ Garrus et al . , 2001 ] ) and a LYPX n L motif ( involved in interaction with ALIX [ Strack et al . , 2003 ] ) and has been shown to be essential for budding of Gag VLPs as well as HIV - 1 . To determine whether these motifs are required for ESCRT - III recruitment , we deleted the p6 domain from Gag ( referred to as Gag Δ p6 ) . In cells expressing Gag Δ p6 , very few VLPs were released and instead large numbers of arrested Gag - containing buds accumulated on the surface ( Figure 7 and not shown ) . Importantly , this was true regardless of whether Vps4 was present or not , confirming that the p6 domain is required for VLP release . On unroofed plasma membranes Gag assemblies similar to those formed by full - length Gag were observed but were not surrounded by ESCRT - III rings ( Figure 7 ) , demonstrating that p6 sequences are required to recruit ESCRT - III . Furthermore , no struts were apparent , consistent with the hypothesis that these correspond to ESCRT - I and / or Alix . We were , however , unable to confirm the identity of the struts because avail - able antibodies were unsuitable . Detailed mutagenesis coupled with antibodies appropriate for immu - nodecoration on these samples will be needed to conclusively identify these structures . Models for ESCRT - III function in vesicle biogenesis The data presented here provide the first views of endogenous ESCRT - III filaments forming the rings and spirals frequently drawn in models of ESCRT function but not previously seen on cellular mem - branes . Earlier studies of various ESCRT - III polymers in vitro and in transfected cells inspired thinking Cell biology Cashikar et al . eLife 2014 ; 3 : e02184 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 02184 11 of 17 Research article about how different filamentous and tubular structures might function in vesicle biogenesis and membrane scission . Ideas ranged from purse - string like constriction of a ring ( Saksena et al . , 2009 ) to polymer - driven membrane buckling ( Lenz et al . , 2009 ) to the more prevalent dome - based membrane scission model ( Fabrikant et al . , 2009 ) and its variants ( Boura et al . , 2012 ; Elia et al . , 2012 ; Henne et al . , 2012 ) . We propose a modified model that builds on many of these previous ideas , interpolating between the rings of ESCRT - III we see around HIV - 1 Gag assemblies and the completed conical spirals that accumulate on the membrane ( Figure 8 ) . In this model , a first role for ESCRT - III is to encircle and thereby delineate cargo and membrane destined for inclusion in a vesicle or VLP ( Figure 8A ) . The encircling filament develops when nucleating factors activated by cargo form struts around a central domain and in turn recruit ESCRT - III . Either because of intrinsic filament curvature or because of multiple contacts with cargo , ESCRT - III filaments grow to surround the cargo ( Figure 8A ) . Because Figure 6 . ESCRT - III filaments surround Gag assemblies in cells depleted of Vps4 . ( A ) HEK293T cells treated with Vps4A & Vps4B siRNA accumulate unique filament - encircled Gag assemblies .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 02184 . 011 Cell biology Cashikar et al . eLife 2014 ; 3 : e02184 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 02184 12 of 17 Research article encircled Gag assemblies uniquely accumulate when Vps4 is missing ( Figure 6 ) , we propose that an important and previously unappreciated role for Vps4 is to release connection ( s ) between the ESCRT - III filament and cargo , perhaps displacing the struts while also opening the ring . The ESCRT - III filament can then grow to adopt its preferred shape as a conical spiral ( Figure 8B ) potentially driving neck constriction and vesicle release as shown ( Figure 8C ) . Finally ( and not shown ) , Vps4 is also responsible for disassembling ESCRT - III filaments to recycle their subunits during or after vesicle release . While this model remains speculative because it is based on static images of ESCRT - III polymers stabilized by depleting Vps4 , it both supports important aspects of earlier models describing ESCRT - III driven membrane remodeling ( Fabrikant et al . , 2009 ; Wollert et al . , 2009 ; Elia et al . , 2012 ; Henne et al . , 2012 ) and provides explana - tions for a few previously enigmatic observa - tions . Interestingly , there are similarities between the different forms of ESCRT - III seen here and structures previously described by EM of purified yeast proteins ( Henne et al . , 2012 ) . Specifically , Henne et al . found that combining ESCRT - II as a nucleating factor with ESCRT - III proteins ( Vps20 and Snf7 or a combination of four core ESCRT - III proteins ) generated rings of ESCRT - III ∼ 50 – 70 nm in diameter , appropriate for surrounding a domain needed to create 25 – 35 nm ILVs characteristic of yeast MVBs . In our images , the ∼ 110 nm average outer diameter ( Figure 3C ) of ESCRT - III spirals would in an analogous manner support formation of the ∼ 50 nm vesicles typical of mammalian ILVs and extracellular vesicles . Henne et al . also found that combining ESCRT - III proteins with each other in the absence of ESCRT - II created spring - like three - dimensional coils . Not clear was whether ( and how ) rings might convert into spiraling filaments . We suggest that Vps4 may have a general role in converting a cargo confining ring to a vesicle - generating spiral , likely by separating ESCRT - III from nucleating factors seen as struts in our model . The idea that Vps4 plays specific and essential roles both before and after membrane scission is supported by a number of observations . Fluorescently tagged Vps4 is recruited to growing viral particles before they are released ( Baumgartel et al . , 2011 ; Jouvenet et al . , 2011 ) , Vps4 appears at two stages prior to cellular abscission ( Elia et al . , 2011 ) , ESCRT - III and Vps4 are recruited simultaneously to the centroid of dividing Crenarchaea ( Samson et al . , 2011 ) , and perturbing Vps4 function and / or regulation changes ILV size and / or release in yeast ( Nickerson et al . , 2010 ; Wemmer et al . , 2011 ; Adell et al . , 2014 ) . A prediction of our model is that interfering with Vps4 activity—whether by depleting it or express - ing a dominant negative mutant—will trap ESCRT - III around the base of incipient vesicular structures and in particular around the base of emerging Gag assemblies . This trapped ESCRT - III will remain attached to Gag inside any VLPs that are ultimately released . This in turn will increase ESCRT - III recov - ered in whatever VLPs are released , something that we ( data not shown ) and others ( Van Engelenburg et al . , 2014 ) have in fact observed . While we favor the model shown in Figure 8 , one can also envision other ways in which the remod - eling of ESCRT - III rings and spirals could contribute to vesicle formation and membrane scission .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 02184 13 of 17 Research article techniques capable of resolving and potentially controlling protein and membrane dynamics will be important in gaining new insight into these processes . Defining the detailed temporal rela - tionship between Vps4 activity and ESCRT - III assembly during virus or vesicle formation will be particularly important . Additionally , while we have taken advantage of the fact that ESCRT polymers are present on the plasma membrane to facilitate deep - etch EM imaging , future studies of their function at the plasma membrane are clearly war - ranted . Overall , the work described here estab - lishes that endogenous ESCRT - III takes the form of filaments that form circles and conical spirals on the membrane . We propose that these rings and spirals , while longer - lived than normal , represent functional states of a general ESCRT - III membrane scission machine . Materials and methods Cell culture HeLa , HEK293T , U2OS , and COS - 7 cells originally derived from ATCC were grown in DME ( Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Atlanta Biologics , Atlanta GA ) and 2 mM L - glutamine . Plasmids and antibodies pCMV55 encoding HIV - 1 Gag was kindly provided by Dr Lee Ratner ( Washington University , St . Louis MO ) and used as previously described ( Shim et al . , 2007 ) . The p6 domain of Gag was deleted by introducing a stop codon to remove 52 amino acids from the C - terminus and introduce an XhoI site using the primer AAAAAACTCGAGTTAAAAA TTCCCTGGCCTTCCCTTG . Full length and p6 deleted Gag were cloned into pcDNA4TO ( Invitrogen ) . pGag - EGFP was obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program , Division of AIDS , NIAID , NIH ( Cat # 11468 ) from Dr Marilyn Resh ( Hermida - Matsumoto and Resh , 2000 ) . Plasmids encoding ESCRT - III proteins have been previously described , including untagged human CHMP4A ( also referred to as hSnf7 - 1 ) in pcDNA3 ( Lin et al . , 2005 ) , CHMP4A ( α 1 – α 5 ) in pcDNA3 . 1FLAG ( Shim et al . , 2007 ) , and CHMP2A full length and α 1 – α 5 truncation in pcDNA3 . 1FLAG ( Shim et al . , 2007 ) . Antibodies used include rabbit polyclonals against Gag ( MA - specific ; kind gift from Dr Lee Ratner , Washington University School of Medicine , St . Louis MO ) , CHMP6 ( PA5 - 21831 ; ThermoScientific , Waltham MA ) , CHMP4A ( Lin et al . , 2005 ) , CHMP4B ( Shiels et al . , 2007 ) , CHMP2A ( sc67227 ; Santa Cruz , Dallas , TX ) , CHMP2B ( ab33174 ; AbCam , Cambridge , England ) , CHMP1B ( 14639 - 1 - AP ; Protein Tech Group , Chicago , IL ) , VPS4B ( Lin et al . , 2005 ) and mouse monoclonals against tubulin ( Sigma , St . Louis MO ) and α - SNAP ( SySy , Gottingen , Germany ) . siRNA duplexes targeting VPS4A ( CCGAGAAGCUGAAGGAUUAdTdT ) and VPS4B ( CCAAAGA AGCACUGAAAGAdTdT ) have been previously described ( Kieffer et al . , 2008 ) and were from ThermoScientific . Figure 8 . Speculative model describing ESCRT - III and Vps4 function in vesicle biogenesis and release . ( A ) Cargo - loosely defined to include either HIV - 1 Gag or material destined for incorporation into ILVs – is concentrated in the circular domain shown in pink . After reaching some threshold , cargo recruits and / or activates factors to initiate ESCRT - III assembly . These are represented here by green ‘struts’ perpendicular to the cargo perimeter . Once nucleated , the ESCRT - III filament extends to surround and confine cargo . In the absence of Vps4 , this intermediate accumulates . ( B ) When present , we propose a new role for Vps4 in which it is engaged to break connection ( s ) between ESCRT - III and cargo , thereby allowing the ESCRT - III spiral to grow into its preferred spiral shape . ESCRT - III recruits new membrane into the neck as it grows , shown by the addition of blue membrane to the budding vesicle . ( C ) A fully assembled ESCRT - III spiral narrows the membrane neck , ultimately driving vesicle release .

Immunofluorescence HeLa and HEK293T cells plated on glass coverslips were stained as previously described ( Shim et al . , 2007 ) . Confocal imaging was performed on an Olympus FV500 or FV1200 microscope using a 60x 1 . 4 NA objective . Maximum intensity projections were prepared using ImageJ ( version 1 . 47u ) . Brightness and contrast were adjusted as necessary with Adobe Photoshop ( Adobe Systems , San Jose , CA ) and composite figures were prepared in Adobe Illustrator . Transfections and sample preparation for deep - etch EM Cells plated at ∼ 70 % confluence were transfected with 15 nM each of siRNA duplexes targeting VPS4A and VPS4B using Dharmafect # 1 according to manufacturer guidelines . Cells were trypsinized ∼ 24 hr later and replated onto 12 mm poly - L - or poly - D - lysine coated BioCoat coverslips ( BD Biosciences , East Rutherford NJ ) . Plasma membranes were prepared the following day , typically 40 – 50 hr after ini - tial siRNA transfection . This was done as previously described ( Hanson et al . , 2008 ) . Briefly , coverslips were washed in 30 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 2 mM CaCl2 and then dipped into an intracel - lular buffer ( 30 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , 70 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , and 3 mM EGTA ) and subjected to a brief pulse of ultrasound before transfer into the same buffer containing fixative ( 2 % glutaraldehyde or 2 % PFA if immunostaining was planned ) . The area of coverslip with the highest yield of plasma mem - branes was identified by phase contrast microscopy and trimmed with a diamond knife to ∼ 3 × 3 mm . Transfection of Gag or Gag - GFP encoding plasmids was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . When combined with siRNA transfections , plasmid transfections were carried out 24 hr after initial introduction of siRNA . ESCRT - III encoding plasmids were transfected as previously described ( Hanson et al . , 2008 ) again using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies ) . To extract fixed samples with detergent ( Figures 4E , 5E , F ) , fixed coverslips were incubated for 2 hr in buffer containing 1 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 1 % saponin . Immunogold antibody decoration Antibody staining was performed as previously described ( Hanson et al . , 2008 ) using 18 nm gold - conjugated goat anti - rabbit or anti - mouse ( Jackson Immunoresearch , West Grove , PA ) antibodies . Freezing , replicating , and imaging deep - etch samples Samples were prepared essentially as described ( Hanson et al . , 2008 ) except that platinum ( ∼ 2 nm , as before ) was evaporated onto samples from 17 – 18° above the horizontal . Replicas were viewed on a JEOL 1400 transmission electron microscope at two different tilt angles ( either ±5 or ±10° ) and images were captured using an AMT camera . Digital image pairs were made into anaglyphs by converting one each to red and blue / green , layering them on top of each other using the screen blending mode in Adobe Photoshop , and finally aligning them to each other using the auto - align function . Composite figures were prepared using Adobe Illustrator . Digital measurements were made using ImageJ ( v . 1 . 47u ) .
