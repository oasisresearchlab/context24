However , the delivery of Cas9 and synthesis of guide RNA ( gRNA ) remain as steps that can limit overall efﬁciency and ease of use . Here we describe methods for rapid synthesis of gRNA and for delivery of Cas9 protein / gRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes ( Cas9 RNPs ) into a variety of mammalian cells through liposome - mediated transfection or electroporation . Using these methods , we report nuclease - mediated indel rates of up to 94 % in Jurkat T cells and 87 % in induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSC ) for a single target . When we used this approach for multigene targeting in Jurkat cells we found that two - locus and three - locus indels were achieved in approximately 93 % and 65 % of the resulting isolated cell lines , respectively . Further , we found that the off - target cleavage rate is reduced using Cas9 protein when compared to plasmid DNA transfection . Taken together , we present a streamlined cell engineering workﬂow that enables gRNA design to analysis of edited cells in as little as four days and results in highly efﬁcient genome modulation in hard - to - transfect cells . The reagent preparation and delivery to cells is amenable to high throughput , multiplexed genome - wide cell engineering . © 2015 The Authors . Published by Elsevier B . V .

Introduction CRISPR - Cas9mediatedgenomeengineeringenablesresearchers to modify genomic DNA in vivo directly and efﬁciently ( Cho et al . , 2013a ; Mali et al . , 2013 ; Jiang et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2013 ) . Three components ( Cas9 , mature crRNA and tracrRNA ) are essential for functional activity . Although the mature crRNA and tracrRNA can be synthesized chemically , the quality of the synthetic RNA is not sufﬁcient for in vivo cell engineering due to the presence of trun - cated by - products ( data not shown ) . Therefore , templates for the mature crRNA and tracrRNA or a combined single gRNA are often cloned into a Cas9 expression plasmid or built into separate plas - mids driven by either U6 or H1 promoters for transcription after transfectionofmammaliancells ( Congetal . , 2013 ; Malietal . , 2013 ) . However the plasmids have been shown to have toxicity in some Abbreviations : CRISPR , clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ; CAS9 , CRISPR associated protein ; gRNA , guide RNA ; crRNA , CRISPR RNA ; tracrRNA , trans - activating crRNA . ∗ Corresponding author .

Recently , the use of Cas9 delivered as mRNA has led to increases in the rate of genomic cleavage in some cells . For example , a mixture of Cas9 mRNA and a single species of gRNA were co - injected into mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells resultinginbiallelicmutationsin95 % ofnewbornmice ( Wangetal . , 2013 ) . To make guide RNA , often a linearized plasmid containing the T7 promoter and the gRNA sequence is used directly or a linear template is created via PCR ampliﬁcation of the targeting sequence from a plasmid . If a 5 (cid:3) T7 promoter does not appear in the plas - mid , it is often added at this step and the resulting PCR product can be used in an in vitro transcription reaction ( Jinek et al . , 2012 ; Wangetal . , 2013 ) . Alternatively , asyntheticDNAfragmentcontain - ing a T7 promoter , crRNA and tracrRNA can be used as a template to prepare a gRNA by in vitro transcription . Overall , these repre - sent a labor - intensive and time - consuming workﬂow , which led us to seek a simpler method to synthesize high quality gRNA . To that , we describe here a streamlined modular approach for gRNA production in vitro . Starting with two short single stranded oligos , the gRNA template is assembled in a ‘one pot’ PCR reaction . The product is then used as template in an in vitro transcription ( IVT ) reaction which is followed by a rapid puriﬁcation step , yielding transfection - ready gRNA in as little as four hours . http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . jbiotec . 2015 . 04 . 024 0168 - 1656 / © 2015 The Authors .

Liang et al . / Journal of Biotechnology 208 ( 2015 ) 44 – 53 45 To streamline the cell engineering workﬂow further , we sought to eliminate any remaining cellular transcription or translation by directly introducing Cas9 protein / gRNA ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) complexes directly to the cells . Microinjection of Cas9 protein and gRNA complexes into C . elegans was ﬁrst described in 2013 ( Cho et al . , 2013b ) and was subsequently used to generate gene - knockout mice and zebraﬁsh with mutation rates of up to 93 % in newborn mice ( Sung et al . , 2014 ) . Following that report , Cas9 protein / gRNA RNP complexes were delivered into cultured human ﬁbroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSC ) via elec - troporation with high efﬁciency and relatively low off - target effects ( Kim et al . , 2014 ) . In that study , a large amount of Cas9 protein ( 4 . 5 – 45 (cid:2) g ) and gRNA ( 6 – 60 (cid:2) g ) were necessary for efﬁ - cient genome modiﬁcation ( up to 79 % indel efﬁciency ) . Another recent study delivered Cas9 / gRNA RNPs along with donor DNA for homology directed repair into HEK293T , human primary neona - tal ﬁbroblasts and human ESCs cells via electroporation ( Lin et al . , 2014 ) . Here also , large amounts of Cas9 protein ( 4 . 8 – 16 (cid:2) g ) were necessary for efﬁcient modiﬁcation . Most recently , delivery of Cas9 protein - associated gRNA complexes via liposomes was reported , in which RNAiMAX was used to deliver Cas9 : sgRNA nuclease com - plexes into cultured human cells and into the mouse inner ear in vivo with up to 80 % and 20 % genome modiﬁcation efﬁciency , respectively ( Zuris et al . , 2015 ) . The CRISPR / Cas system has been demonstrated as an efﬁcient gene - targeting tool for multiplexed genome editing ( Wang et al . , 2013 ; Kabadi et al . , 2014 ; Sakuma et al . , 2014 ; Cong et al . , 2013 ) . For example , co - transfections of mouse ES cells with constructs expressing Cas9 and three sgRNAs targeting Tet1 , 2 , and 3 resulted in 20 % of cells having mutations in all six alleles of the three genes based on restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) assay ( Wang et al . , 2013 ) . Lentiviral delivery of a single vector expressing Cas9 and four sgRNAs into primary human dermal ﬁbroblasts resulted in about 30 % simultaneous editing of four genomic loci among ten clonal populations based upon genomic cleavage detection assays ( Kabadi et al . , 2014 ) . In one recent study , ‘all - in - one’ expression vectors containing seven guide RNA expres - sion cassettes and a Cas9 nuclease / nickase expression cassette were delivered into 293T cells with genome cleavage efﬁciency ranging from 4 to 36 % for each individual target ( Sakuma et al . , 2014 ) . In general , the efﬁciency of editing multiple genes in the human genome using plasmid - based delivery methods remains relatively low which subsequently increases the workload for downstream clonal isolation . In this study , we developed an in vitro gRNA production sys - tem and used a systematic approach to optimize the conditions for delivery of Cas9 : gRNA complexes via lipid - mediated transfec - tion or electroporation . A variety of mammalian cell lines were tested , including primary cells and other hard - to - transfect cells . PlasmidDNA , mRNAandCas9proteintransfectionswereevaluated side by side . Using Cas9 protein transfection via electroporation , we achieved superior genome editing efﬁciencies even in hard - to - transfect cells . In addition , we explored the genome editing of multiple targets simultaneously using the Cas9 RNPs delivery sys - tem described here . We found that delivery of Cas9 RNPs not only led to high indel production at single locus , but supports highly efﬁcient biallelic modulation of at least two genes in a single trans - fection . 2 .

A549 cells , U - 2 OS cells , Neuro - 2a ( N2A ) cells were purchased from ATCC . MEF feeder cells and ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 were purchased from EMD Millipore . Monoclonal Cas9 antibody was ordered from Diagenode . Recombinant Cas9 protein with a NLS was initially puriﬁed as described ( Kim et al . , 2014 ) and later obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc . All oligonucleotides usedforgRNAsynthesisandgenomiccleavagedetectionwerefrom Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ( Table S1 ) . 2 . 2 . One - step synthesis of gRNA template The 80bp cr / tracrRNA constant region was PCR ampliﬁed from the GeneArt ® CRISPR Nuclease Vector ( 1ng ) using the Constant Forward and Universal Reverse oligos ( 10 (cid:2) M ) and puriﬁed via agarose gel extraction . The concentration of PCR product was mea - sured by Nanodrop ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) and the molarity was calculated based on the molecular weight of 49 . 6kDa . To prepare a mixture of oligonucleotides , the 80bp cr / tracrRNA PCR product ( 0 . 15 (cid:2) M ) was mixed with universal forward and reverse oligos ( 10 (cid:2) M ) as well as target - speciﬁc forward and reverse oligos ( 0 . 3 (cid:2) M ) . For each target locus , 2 oligonucleotides that recreate the target sequence and share complementary with the bordering T7 pro - moter and 80bp cr / tracr constant region were designed ( Fig . 2A ) . The forward oligo ( Target F1 ) contains the 18 base T7 promoter sequence as well as the ﬁrst 16 bases of the target and the reverse oligo ( Target R1 ) contains the reverse complement of the ﬁrst 15 bases of the cr / tracr constant region and the last 19 bases of the target ( Table 1s ) . To set up the synthesis of gRNA template , aliquots of the pooled oligonucleotides were added to a Phusion Flash High - Fidelity PCR Master Mix and ampliﬁed using manufac - turer’s recommended reaction conditions . The PCR product was analyzed by a 2 % E - Gel ® EX Agarose Gel , followed by puriﬁca - tion using Purelink ® PCR micro column .

Before transfection , cells were adapted to feeder - free conditions and maintained on attachment - factor - coated plates in mouse ESC - conditioned medium . When setting up the experiments for transfections , 1 × 10 5 cells were plated per well in a 24 - well tissue culture dish coated with attachment factor . CD34 + cord blood cells were cul - tured using StemPro ® - 34 SFM Complete Medium supplemented with 100ng / mL of SCF , 50ng / mL of IL - 3 and 25ng / mL of GM - CSF . Primary human keratinocytes cells neonatal ( HEKn ) were grown in a tissue culture dish treated with Coating Matrix Kit in EpiLife medium containing 60 (cid:2) M of calcium chloride . Cells were grown for three passages before using for experiments . All cultures were maintained in 5 % CO 2 at 37 ◦ C in a humidiﬁed incubator . Prior to transfection , adherent cells were detached with Gibco TrypLE Select Enzyme and then resuspended in the appropriate growth media . 2 . 5 . Lipid - mediated cell transfection One day prior to transfection , the cells were seeded in a 24 - well plate at a cell density of 1 – 2 × 10 5 cells per well . For plasmid DNA transfection , 0 . 5 (cid:2) g DNA was added to 25 (cid:2) l of Opti - MEM medium , followed by addition of 25 (cid:2) l of Opti - MEM containing 2 (cid:2) l of Lipofectamine 2000 . The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15min and then added to the cells . For Cas9 mRNA transfection , 0 . 5 (cid:2) g Cas9 mRNA ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) was added to 25 (cid:2) l of Opti - MEM , followed by addition of 50 – 100ng gRNA . Meanwhile , 2 (cid:2) l of either Lipofectamine 3000 , MessengerMax or RNAiMAX was diluted into 25 (cid:2) l of Opti - MEM and then mixed with mRNA / gRNA sample . The mixture was incu - bated for 15min prior to addition to the cells . For Cas9 protein transfection , 500ng of puriﬁed Cas9 protein was added to 25 (cid:2) l of Opti - MEM medium , followed by addition of 120ng gRNA . The molar ratio of gRNA to Cas9 protein was kept at approximately 1 to 1 . 2 : 1 . The sample was mixed by gently tapping the tubes a few times and then incubated at room temperature for 10min . To a separate test tube , 2 (cid:2) l of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX , MessengerMax , or 3000 was added to 25 (cid:2) l of Opti - MEM medium . The diluted transfection reagent was transferred to the tube con - taining Cas9 protein / gRNA complexes , followed by incubation at room temperature for 15min and then added to the cells . In each case , the entire solution was added to the cells in a 24 - well plate and mixed by gently swirling the plate . The plate was incubated at 37 ◦ C for 48h in a 5 % CO 2 incubator . The percentage of locus - speciﬁc indel formation was measured by GeneArt ® Genomic Cleavage Detection Kit ( GCD ) . The band inten - sities were quantitated using the Alpha Imager software ( Bio - Rad ) . Each cell line was tested with each version of Lipofectamine ( 3000 , RNAiMAX , and MEssengerMAX ) . The lipid that resulted in highest cleavage efﬁciency is listed in Table S2 . 2 . 6 . Electroporation For suspension cells , such as Jurkat T cells , K562 cells or CD34 + human cord blood cells , 1 – 2 × 10 5 cells were used per electropo - ration using Neon ® Transfection System 10 (cid:2) L Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . For adherent A549 , U2OS and N2A cells , 5 × 10 4 cells were used per electroporation . For adherent HEK293FT , mESC , hESC , human iPSC , A549 , and NHEK cells , 1 × 10 5 were used per electroporation . To maximize the genome cleavage efﬁciency , the Neon 24 opti - mization protocol was applied according to the manufacturer’s instruction . To set up a master mix , 24 (cid:2) g of puriﬁed Cas9 pro - tein was added to 240 (cid:2) l of Resuspension Buffer R provided in the kit , followed by addition of 4 . 8 (cid:2) g of gRNA . The mixture was incu - bated at room temperature for 10min . Meanwhile , 4 . 8 × 10 6 cells were transferred to a sterile test tube and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5min . The supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was resus - pended in 1ml of PBS without Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + . Upon centrifugation , the supernatant was carefully aspirated so that almost all the PBS buffer was removed with no or minimum loss of cells . The Resus - pension Buffer R containing the Cas9 protein / gRNA complexes was then used to resuspend the cell pellets . A 10 (cid:2) l cell suspension was used for each of the 24 optimization conditions , which varied in pulse voltage , pulse width and the number of pulses . The electro - porated cells were transferred immediately to a 24 well containing 0 . 5ml of the corresponding growth medium for each cell line and then incubated for 48h in a 5 % CO 2 incubator . The cells were har - vested by centrifugation and then washed once with PBS , followed by GCD assay . Upon optimization of electroporation condition , a higher amount of Cas9 protein ( 1 . 5 – 2 (cid:2) g ) and gRNA ( 300 – 400ng ) could be applied to further increase the genome editing efﬁciency if needed . X . Liang et al . / Journal of Biotechnology 208 ( 2015 ) 44 – 53 47 Each cell line was tested for with the Neon 24 optimization protocol . Speciﬁc electroporation conditions that resulted in the highest cleavage efﬁciency are listed in Table S2 . For each target in the multiplexing assays , 1 – 2 (cid:2) g of Cas9 proteinand200 – 400ngofgRNA ( maintaininga1 : 1ratio ) werepre - incubated separately in Resuspension Buffer R for 10min at room temperaturepriortomixingwiththecellpelletforelectroporation . For clonal isolation , the cell number of transfected cells was counted upon 48h incubation , followed by a serial of dilution to 96 well plates with a cell density of 10 – 20 cells per plate based on the cell count . After clonal expansion for three weeks , cells from each individual well were harvested , followed by PCR ampli - ﬁcation of the target locus . The PCR fragments were then cloned using a TOPO vector and transformed into TOP10 competent cells .

Single cell suspensions were incubated with TRA - 1 - 60 Alexa Fluor ® 488 conjugated antibodies and SSEA4 Alexa Fluor ® 647 for 1h at room temperature with gentle agitation . Two microliters ( 50 × concentration , as supplied ) of each antibody were added to 0 . 5mL of DMEM / F - 12 . Following the incubation , the cells were centrifuged and washed once with Dulbecco’s Phosphate - Buffered Saline ( DPBS ) . After the removal of the DPBS wash , the pelleted cells were gently re - suspended in 1ml of DPBS and stained through a strainer capped tube .

After washing , the membrane was incubated for 1hour with rabbit anti - mouse antibody - HRP conjugate at 1 : 2000 dilution . Upon extensive washing , the membrane was developed with Pierce ECL reagent , followed by imaging using a Fuji imager LAS 4000 instrument . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Three day cell engineering workﬂow To streamline the genome engineering workﬂow , we sought to simplify the gRNA synthesis procedure and shorten the time from experimental design to initial analysis as much as possible . We presentaprocesswhereonday1 , theresearcherdesignsandorders short DNA oligonucleotides and seeds the cells of interest for next daytransfection ( Fig . 1 ) . Uponreceivingtheoligonucleotidesonday 2 , the researcher assembles the gRNA template in less than 1h by ‘one pot’ PCR . The resulting PCR product is then subjected to in vitro transcription to synthesize gRNA in approximately 3h . Upon asso - ciation of gRNA with puriﬁed Cas9 protein , the Cas9 RNPs are used to transfect cells via lipid - mediated delivery or electroporation . As early as day 3 ( 24h post transfection ) , the cells can be harvested for analysis of locus - speciﬁc genome modiﬁcation efﬁciency . We used an online web tool to identify candidate 20 nt gRNA target sequences for each loci ( Beta Testing Version , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . A pair of 34 nt forward and reverse oligonucleotides comprising each target sequence were designed as described . To assemble the DNA template for gRNA production , we combined the 2targetspeciﬁcoligos ( TargetF1 / R1 ) withamixtureofthe2univer - sal oligos ( Universal Forward / Reverse ) and a puriﬁed PCR product representing the constant non - targeting region of the full gRNA ( Fig . 2A ) . The oligonucleotide pool concentrations as well as the PCR conditions were optimized such that the template was ampli - ﬁed in less than 40min in a single tube with ( Fig . 2B ) . The gRNA template was used directly to prepare gRNA via in vitro transcrip - tion ( IVT ) . The resulting gRNA was puriﬁed , yielding high levels of gRNA with low amounts of detectable by - products ( Fig . 2C ) . This approachwasvalidatedbysynthesisofmorethan96distinctgRNAs ( unpublished results ) . To determine the error rate in the synthetic gRNA DNA template , we cloned and sequenced the PCR fragments and found that using this design approximately 7 % of gRNA tem - plates harbored mutations , mainly small deletions occurring at the extreme 3 (cid:3) end and 5 (cid:3) ends of the mature template compared to 21 % mutants with an alternative design of using long overlapping oligonucleotides ( Fig . 2D ) . Since all the mutations observed using our design appeared to be due to errors in the oligonucleotides , we next tried HPLC - puriﬁed universal forward and reverse primers which further decreased the error rate to 3 . 6 % with no mutations 48 X . Liang et al . / Journal of Biotechnology 208 ( 2015 ) 44 – 53 Fig . 1 . Cell engineering workﬂow . On day 1 , the researcher designs CRISPR targets and seeds cells . Synthesis of gRNA and cell transfection with Cas9 protein / gRNA complex ( Cas9 RNP ) are performed on day 2 . Genome cleavage assays carried out on days 3 – 4 . detected in the target region , which was similar to the 2 % error rate observed with the control template prepared from an ‘all - in - one’ plasmid . Taken together , this optimized process facilitates the con - version of a small set of DNA oligonucleotides into puriﬁed gRNA in approximately 4h with an accuracy of up to 96 % and no errors detectedinthetargetingorCas9complexing ( cr / tracrRNA ) regions . This level of accuracy should be sufﬁcient for routine screening of gRNAs , but if a sequence veriﬁed gRNA is required the gRNA template can easily be Topo cloned . Given that the process con - sists solely of liquid handling PCR , transcription , and RNA isolation steps , it is well suited for high throughput gRNA production and screening . 3 . 2 . Liposome - mediated Cas9 protein transfection To examine the activity of synthetic gRNA , we pre - complexed puriﬁed synthetic IVT gRNA with Cas9 protein , hypothesizing that creating complexes of puriﬁed gRNAs with Cas9 protein prior to delivery to the cells might lead to higher genome editing efﬁciency duetotheprotectionofthegRNAasittransitstothenucleusduring thetransfectionprocess . Toexamine invivo functionalityofthesys - tem , human embryonic kidney ( HEK293FT ) cells were transfected with pre - complexed Cas9 / gRNA ribonucleoproteins ( Cas9 RNPs ) using a set of cationic lipid reagents , followed by a GCD assay . The commonly - used plasmid DNA or RNA lipofectamine transfection reagent had been shown to be able to deliver many proteins into cells , so we tested several lipofectamine variants for their ability to efﬁciently deliver Cas9 RNPs ( Sells et al . , 1995 ) . Lipofectamine 3000 and RNAiMAX outperformed Lipofectamine 2000 in HEK 293 cells ( Figure S1 ) , which is in agreement with the recent ﬁnding that RNAiMAX performed better than Lipofectamine 2000 for delivery of Cas9 RNPs with low cell toxicity ( Zuris et al . , 2014 ) . We tested the molar ratio of cas9 protein to gRNA and generally observed that cleavage activity plateaued at a 1 : 1 ratio ( data not shown ) . For protein transfection , serum - free medium is generally used to avoid serum protein inference . In this study however , we observed that thecompletemediumcontaining10 % FBScouldfacilitateincreased protein transfection and genome modiﬁcation ( Fig . 3A , panel a ) . The efﬁciencies of genome editing via plasmid DNA , mRNA and Cas9 RNP transfection were evaluated using three different target loci , HPRT , AAVS and RelA . Plasmid DNA and mRNA were deliv - ered into HEK293 cells by Lipofectamine 3000 , whereas Cas9 RNPs were delivered with RNAiMAX . The efﬁciencies of genome modi - ﬁcation were similar among three target loci in DNA , mRNA and Cas9 protein - transfected cells ( Fig . 3A ) . Nextweexaminedthekineticsofgenomecleavagebytransfect - ingcellswitheitherplasmidDNA , mRNA , orCas9RNPs , followedby GCD assays and western blot analysis of cell lysates . We observed similar cleavage kinetics between Cas9 delivered as plasmid DNA , mRNA and protein with efﬁcient cleavage seen at 24h and plateau - ingat48 – 72hpost - transfectioninHEK293cells ( Fig . 3B ) . However , the kinetics of Cas9 RNP and mRNA encoded Cas9 appearance and turnover inside the transfected cells was quite different from that seen with Cas9 delivered via plasmid DNA . Measuring by western blot ( Fig . 3C ) , we found that Cas9 protein accumulated over time in plasmid DNA - transfected cells , whereas the relatively low expres - sion of Cas9 in mRNA - transfected cells seemed to peak as early as four hours post transfection and remained relatively stable for approximately48hbeforediminishing . IntheCas9RNPtransfected cells , the level of Cas9 protein peaked in at the ﬁrst time point , then rapidly decreased and was barely detectable in our assay at 48h . As a control , the blot membrane was stripped and re - probed with anti - actin antibody . Similar levels of actin expression were observed among samples ( data not shown ) . Because of the observed faster protein depletion , we hypoth - esized that the off - target cleavage activity for Cas9 RNP and mRNA / gRNAtransfectionwouldbelowerthanthatofplasmidDNA transfection ( Fu et al . , 2013 ; Pattanayak et al . , 2013 ; Hsu et al . , 2013 ) . To test this , we targeted a locus ( target site 3 ) in the VEGFA gene which has been identiﬁed as having several high activity X .

( B ) One - stepPCRsynthesisofgRNADNAtemplate . Themixture of oligonucleotides and PCR product were assembled in a single tube by PCR and the product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis ( Lanes 2 and 3 ) . A gRNA DNA template ampliﬁed from a plasmid served as control ( Lane 1 ) . ( C ) Aliquots of PCR product ( Lanes 2 and 3 ) along with the plasmid derived control ( Lane 1 ) were subjected to in vitro transcription . The resulting product was analyzed by denaturing gel . ( D ) Analysis of gRNA DNA template sequence error rate . The gRNA DNA templates were synthesized using the standard gene synthesis approach with a set of long oligonucleotides ( Long ) . Alternatively , the oligonucleotide mixture described above was used for PCR assembly . The two standard desalted universal forward and reverse primers ( Short ) were compared to HPLC or PAGE - puriﬁed primers ( Short / HPLC ) . The synthetic gRNA DNA templates , as well as a control gRNA DNA template PCR ampliﬁed from a DNA control ( Plasmid ) were cloned into a TOPO vector . For each individual template , 96 colonies were randomly picked for sequencing and the errors grouped by location . off - targetsites ( Fuetal . , 2014 ) viaCas9DNA , mRNA , andRNPtrans - fectionintoHEK293FTcellsfollowedbygenomecleavageandlocus sequencing analysis . Among the six potential off - target sites that have been studied previously ( OT3 - 1 , OT3 - 2 , OT3 - 4 , OT3 - 9 , OT3 - 17 and OT3 - 18 ) , only OT3 - 2 and OT3 - 18 were detected to harbor off - target mutation based on GCD analysis . Further analysis of locus OT3 - 2 by sequencing indicated that the ratio of indel mutation of OT3 - 2overon - targetinmRNAandCas9RNPtransfectedcellswas2 fold and 2 . 5 fold lower than that in DNA - transfected cells , respec - tively . The ratio of indel mutation of OT3 - 18 over on - target was 1 . 6 fold and 28 fold lower in mRNA or Cas9 RNP - transfected cells , respectively than in DNA - transfected cells ( Fig . 3D ) . Next we tested the effect of increased Cas9 RNP ( maintaining a 1 : 1 molar ratio of gRNA to protein ) on off - target levels and observed that while on - target editing efﬁciency increased with an increased dose of Cas9 RNP , reaching plateau at around 2 (cid:2) g of Cas9 protein , the off - target modiﬁcation at the OT3 - T2 loci increased at a lower rate ( Figure S2 ) . Taken together , these data suggest that Cas9 delivery as mRNA and pre - complexed protein supports increased genomic cleavage speciﬁcity compared with standard DNA plasmid transfection . In a survey of 11 cell lines ( Table 1 , Table S2 ) , Lipofectamine 3000 worked best for Cas9 plasmid delivery , while depending on cell 50 X .

However , with some cell lines no conditions were found for efﬁcient Cas9 delivery . 3 . 3 . Electroporation - mediated Cas9 protein transfection Many biologically and physiologically relevant cell lines , such as patient derived iPSC and progenitor cells , are refractory to efﬁ - cient transfection by lipid - based reagents . Any improvement in the efﬁciency of genome modulation would facilitate isolation of appropriately engineered cells for experimentation and therapy so we explored alternate means of delivering Cas9 RNPs and Cas9 mRNA / gRNA formulations and their effect on indel generation . Using Jurkat T cells as an initial model , we compared the delivery of Cas9 and gRNA plasmid DNA , Cas9 mRNA / gRNA formulations and Cas9 RNPs using electroporation with a Neon Transfection sys - temanda24conditionoptimizationprotocol ( Fig . 4 , FigureS3 ) . Our results showed that , compared with plasmid DNA and mRNA deliv - eries , superior genome editing efﬁciency was achieved via delivery of Cas9 RNPs with ∼ 90 % HPRT locus - speciﬁc modiﬁcation under severalelectroporationconditions ( Fig . 4A ) . Thecleavageefﬁciency wasdose - dependent , reachingamaximumof88 % atapproximately 1 . 5 (cid:2) g Cas9 protein and 300ng gRNA per transfection ( Fig . 4B ) . After sequencing the cell pools , we found that actually 94 % of tar - get loci harbored mutations near the expected cleavage site located around 3 bases upstream of the NGG PAM sequence . The majority of mutations were distinct from each other with 75 % insertion and 16 % deletion . When we tested the same optimization protocol with human iPSCs , the optimal conditions varied signiﬁcantly from the Jurkat T settings ( Figure S4A ) . The cleavage efﬁciency of the Cas9 RNP , wasimprovedfrom62 % atthestandard1 (cid:2) g / (cid:2) lCas9RNPcon - centration to 89 % at 3 (cid:2) g / (cid:2) l Cas9 RNP ( Figure S4B ) . We checked the transfected iPSCs pluripotency markers SSEA4 and TRA - 1 - 60 by ﬂow cytometry ( Figure S4C ) and observed only a small change from 93 % dual positive in the control to 85 % after transfection with Cas9 RNP . When we sequenced the cell pools at the HPRT locus , we saw an 88 % indel rate and a different indel distribution from Jurkat T of 32 % insertion and 52 % deletion with more large deletions and smaller insertions ( Table S3 ) . Using the optimization protocol , we surveyed the same 11 cell lines used previously for delivery of Cas9 X . Liang et al . / Journal of Biotechnology 208 ( 2015 ) 44 – 53 51 Fig . 4 . Electroporation - mediated transfection . ( A ) Mastermix of plasmid DNA , Cas9 mRNA / gRNA or Cas9 protein / gRNA were used to electroporate Jurkat T cells using the Neon 24 optimization protocol . The numbers 1 – 24 refer to different conditions which vary pulse voltage , pulse width and number of pulses ( Figure S3 ) . The percentage of locus - speciﬁc genome cleavage was estimated 48 - hour post transfection using a GCD assay . ( B ) Dose - dependent effect of genome editing . While keeping the ratio of Cas9 protein / gRNA constant , different amounts of Cas9 RNPs were used for electroporation using protocol 5 . Experiments were done in triplicate . The percentage of cleavage was conﬁrmed by sequencing . plasmid , mRNA or RNPs and saw efﬁcient delivery in all cell lines except for cord blood cells where only RNPs resulted in measurable indel formation ( Table 1 , Table S2 ) . The speciﬁc pulse conditions varied widely depending on cell line and construct . Overall , we saw best results with Cas9 RNPs . Finally we measured the cleavage rate and turnover kinetics of the Cas9 RNPs in mouse ESCs and observed that cleavage could be detected within 4h , plateaued after 8h and the protein appeared to be almost depleted by 12h ( Figure S5 ) . 3 . 4 . Targeting multiple loci in a single transfection Given the high single - locus cleavage efﬁciency measured with the Cas9 RNP system , we next wanted to test the ability to efﬁ - ciently lesion multiple genes in a single transfection . Here we examined the capability of multiplexing Cas9 RNP transfection at three loci ( AAVS1 , RelA and HPRT ) . After pooling and delivering multiple species of Cas9 RNP ( differing only by gRNA target ) , we found that the efﬁciency of simultaneous editing of AAVS1 / HPRT or AAVS1 / RelA / HPRTlociwassigniﬁcantlygreateratalllocicompared with either plasmid or mRNA delivery of Cas9 ( Fig . 5A and C ) . To gain insight into the molecular level of multiplexing , we performed one round of clonal isolation by serial dilution . After clonal expan - sion each of the loci was PCR ampliﬁed , followed by DNA cloning and sequencing . In the case of two gene editing , we found that all of 16 isolated clonal cell lines harbored bi - allelic indel mutations on single AAVS1 loci and 93 . 7 % ( 15 of 16 ) of clonal cells harbored one allelic indel mutation at the HPRT locus as the HPRT target was located on the X chromosome of a male Jurkat T cell line . Overall , 93 . 7 % of the clonal cell populations carried indel mutations on both the AAVS1 and HPRT loci ( Fig . 5B ) . For multiplexing of three genes , we performed three individual cell transfections and clonal isola - tion with a total of 53 single cell lines analyzed . In this experiment , 90 % and 65 % of the clonal cell lines analyzed harbored bi - allelic indel mutations at the AAVS1 and RelA loci , respectively , whereas 80 % of the clonal cells carried indel mutations at the single HPRT locus . Overall , 65 % of the clonal cell lines harbored indel mutations on all three targets at all 5 alleles ( Fig . 5D ) . Further , 100 % of the Jurkat T cell clones were edited at least once , suggesting that the transfection efﬁciency reached nearly 100 % . Taken together , Cas9 RNP delivery via electroporation under the conditions used here achieved exceptionally high mutagenesis frequencies . This repre - sents a substantial improvement in Cas9 - mediated genome editing and signiﬁcantly reduces the workload needed for clonal isolation by signiﬁcantly reducing the number of cells that must be screened in order to identify and isolate the desired cell line . 4 . Discussion The ability to easily modulate the sequence speciﬁcity of the Cas9 nuclease by simply changing the 20 nucleotide targeting sequence of the gRNA offers signiﬁcant versatility in delivery options over other nucleases that have been utilized for genome editing , such as zinc ﬁnger nucleases and TAL effectors . Now , researchers are able to choose from cost - effective and rapid design options by formulating the nuclease as either plasmid DNA , pre - mademRNAorpuriﬁedprotein . Thedesignversatilityisenabledby rapid production of the guide RNA component . Until recently , the gRNA was generally produced via cloning of a template sequence into a plasmid vector or vectors and expressing the Cas9 and gRNA invivo . WedescribeastreamlinedprotocolwheregRNAdesignand template construction is facilitated by synthesis of two short single stranded oligonucleotides . The oligonucleotides are incorporated into gRNA templates via a short PCR reaction followed by conver - sion to gRNA by in vitro transcription . Target - speciﬁc oligos can be designed , ordered , and converted to puriﬁed gRNA in as little as two days . On the second day , the gRNA is formulated with either Cas9 mRNA or protein , and immediately used to transfect cells . The entireprocessconsistscompletelyofliquidhandlingandenzymatic reaction steps , which make it amenable to higher throughput gRNA production and transfection in multi - well plates . We compared the streamlined gRNA workﬂow across the three delivery options and found that in general , Cas9 RNPs offered supe - rior indel production efﬁciency in most of the cell lines we used as a test bed . It is currently not clear why Cas9 RNP and total RNA formulations perform as they do but a factor could be overall size of the lipid complexes , the controlled complexing of the Cas9 pro - tein and gRNA in vitro , the ability of Cas9 protein to protect the gRNA from cellular degradation , and the elimination of DNA - based cellular toxicity . In relation to plasmid delivery , Cas9 introduced as a Cas9 RNP or mRNA appears in the cell at low but evidently functional levels and is cleared rapidly . The rate of protein cas9 clearance and cleavage kinetics appears to be related to the cell lines used as we saw faster evidence of cutting and faster clearance in mouse ESCs than in HEK293FT cells . This variation in cleavage kineticsissupportedbypreviousresultsinK562where > 20 % cleav - age activity was observed within 8h ( Kim et al . , 2014 ) and U2OS where 7 . 8 % cleavage activity was observed with the ﬁrst 3h ( Zuris etal . , 2014 ) . Howevertherearedifferencesintheamountofprotein used and the delivery method ( electroporation or lipid - mediated ) and further study is needed . We also saw variations in how double strand breaks at the same HPRT loci were repaired between Jurkat 52 X . Liang et al . / Journal of Biotechnology 208 ( 2015 ) 44 – 53 Fig . 5 . Multiplegeneeditinginthehumangenome .

GCD assays were performed for each locus at 48h post transfection . Cell aliquots were then subjected to clonalisolationbyserialdilution . Afterclonalexpansion , eachlocuswasPCR - ampliﬁedfromeachclonalcellline . ThePCRproductwasthenclonedintoaplasmidvectorand the percentage of indel mutation was determined by sequencing of eight individual E . coli colonies . Quantitation of double mutants for AAVS1 and HPRT was based on 16 clonal cell lines ( B ) , whereas quantitation of triple mutants of AAVS , RelA and HPRT was based on a total of 53 clonal cell lines derived from three independent experiments ( D ) . For individual loci , + + indicates homozygote wildtype , + / − heterozygote , and − / − indicates heterozygote knock out where each allele has a different indel . For multiple loci , suchasAAVS / HPRT , + / + indicateshomozygotewildtypeforallallelestargeted , + / − indicatesheterozygoteknockoutofatleastoneallele , and − / − indicatesheterozygote knock out of all alleles . T and human iPSCs . Our results along with previous work ( Mali et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2014 ) , suggests that different cell lines may have variations in how they conduct NHEJ . The fast turnover of cas9 RNP and mRNA compared to the long persistence of cas9 expressedfromplasmidcouldreducetheopportunityforoff - target bindingandcleavage . Inaddition , manyoff - targetsitesarecutwith lower efﬁciency than the on - target site ( Jinek et al . , 2012 ) . Previous research ( Kim et al . , 2014 ; Zuris et al . , 2014 ) also saw reduced off - target cleavage for Cas9 RNP compared to plasmid . Much progress has been made to reduce or eliminate off - target cleavage in CRISPR systems , suchasuseofpairedCas9nickasesanddimeric‘deadCas9 (cid:3) FokI fusions , which has been shown to reduce off - target activity by 50 – 1500 - fold ( Guilinger et al . , 2014 ; Tsai et al . , 2014 ) . Perhaps delivery of these tools via Cas9 RNPs would lead to even higher speciﬁcity while retaining high activity levels . In this work , we were also able to multiplex three Cas9 RNP species targeting separate loci in Jurkat T cells while achieving high levels indel production at all three loci . Further , we observed high rates of biallelic modiﬁcation at two diploid alleles ( AAVS1 and RelA ) in these experiments even when also modifying a third haploid locus ( HPRT ) at similarly high levels . Taken together , the high rates of biallelic modiﬁcation in cell populations suggest that employing Cas9 RNP delivery would signiﬁcantly simplify the workﬂow by facilitating the selection of multigene knockout cell lines from a single experiment . Additionally , the system could be adapted by varying the dosages of individual Cas9 RNP species to better interrogate multigenic disorders . We performed a survey of eleven commonly used mam - malian cell lines comparing CRISPR delivery via plasmid , Cas9 mRNA / gRNA , and Cas9 RNP ( Table 1 ) and found that Cas9 mRNA / gRNA or Cas9 RNPs were superior to plasmid delivery in all cell lines tested . Delivery of these reagents via electropora - tion offered the highest target - speciﬁc indel production under the conditions tested . In all but one case ( NHEK cells ) , Cas9 RNP out performed Cas9 mRNA / gRNA and in human CD34 + cord blood cells , Cas9 RNP delivered via electroporation was the only method that yielded a signiﬁcantly robust editing solution . With both lipid - mediated transfection and electroporation , optimization of transfection conditions for each cell line is necessary for achieving the best cleavage efﬁciency . 5 . Conclusion We describe here a streamlined approach to the mammalian genome engineering workﬂow that takes as few as three days to modify mammalian genomes from CRISPR target design through evaluation of genome editing . To achieve high mutagenesis efﬁ - ciencies in hard - to - transfect cells , we used a systematic approach to optimize transfection conditions where we compared deliv - ery of CRISPR editing tools via plasmid DNA , Cas9 mRNA / puriﬁed gRNA formulations , and pre - complexed Cas9 RNPs . We found Cas9 mRNA / gRNA and Cas9 RNP performance superior to ‘all - in - one’ plasmid DNA constructs in the variety of cell lines analyzed in this work . Most likely due to the high efﬁciency of Cas9 RNP delivery , we were able to efﬁciently modify the genome at multiple loci simultaneously , thereby reducing the workload for downstream clonal isolation in schemes where more than one gene knock - out is desired . Further , we found that delivery of Cas9 RNPs to cell lines X . Liang et al . / Journal of Biotechnology 208 ( 2015 ) 44 – 53 53 considered hard to transfect ( Jurkat , iPSC , CD34 + ) via electropora - tion could yield high levels of locus speciﬁc modiﬁcation .
