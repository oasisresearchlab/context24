The major endocytic mechanism in plants depends on the coat protein clathrin . It starts by clathrin - coated vesicle formation at the plasma membrane , where speciﬁc cargoes are recognized and packaged for internalization . Recently , genetic , biochemical and advanced microscopy studies provided initial insights into mechanisms and roles of clathrin - mediated endocytosis in plants .

DOI 10 . 1016 / j . pbi . 2011 . 08 . 006 Introduction The plasma membrane ( PM ) lipid bilayer , peppered with numerous proteins , forms the cell’s ﬁrst barrier for com - munication with the environment . In this highly dynamic structure , regulated and balanced processes of endocy - tosis and exocytosis perform not only housekeeping func - tions of the PM including maintaining protein and lipid quality , but also regulate transport and signaling at the cell surface . In animal cells , depending on the machinery involved , endocytosis is roughly classiﬁed into clathrin - mediated ( CME ) and clathrin - independent ( CIE ) endocytosis [ 1 – 3 ] . The past decade witnessed an explosion in the knowl - edge of plant trafﬁcking pathways of various physiologi - cally important PM cargoes . At a cellular level , the best characterized models are polarly localized auxin efﬂux carriers PIN - FORMED ( PINs ) [ 4 ] and leucine rich repeat - receptor like kinases ( LRR - RLKs ) such as the brassinosteroid receptor BRASSINOTEROID INSENSITIVE1 - ( BRI1 ) [ 5 ] , and the receptor for bac - terial ﬂagellin , FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 ( FLS2 ) [ 6 ] . Amongst others , the tomato ETHYLENE INDUCING XYLANSE receptor ( LeEIX2 ) [ 7 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] , the polarly localized Arabidopsis boron transporter ( BOR1 ) [ 8 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] , and the iron transporter ( IRT1 ) [ 9 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] , are further important additions to our repertoire of plant PM cargoes with which to start addressing questions of endocytic routes and their regu - lation . However , compared with the elegant CME net - work in animals , the core composition and regulation of the endocytic machinery in plants is still poorly deﬁned . So far , the only unequivocally demonstrated endocytic mechanism in plants is CME and the importance or even existence of CIE is unclear . In this review we summarize the reported CME machinery and highlight the recent advances in understanding the mechanisms and functions of endocytosis in plants . CME in plants CME initiates at the PM with the recruitment of cargo and the coat machinery into foci called clathrin coated pits ( CCPs ) that eventually mature and scission off to form clathrin coated vesicles ( CCVs ) . The CCVs are uncoated in seconds to form uncoated vesicles that fuse with the early endosome ( EE ) where the cargo is further sorted , either for recycling back to the PM , or to the vacuole for degradation [ 2 ] ( Figure 1 ) . Clathrin subunits are recruited from the cytoplasm to the nascent budding sites in the form of hexameric , three legged triskelions composed of three clathrin heavy chains ( CHCs ) and three light chains ( CLCs ) that self polymerize [ 10 ] . Although clathrin cages at the PM and individual triskelions have been ultrastructurally visual - ized in plants and CCVs were isolated [ 11 , 12 ] , it was not until recently that the role of CME was molecularly demonstrated as a major route of endocytosis in plant cells [ 4 ] . Arabidopsis encodes two CHC and three CLC genes ( Table 1 ) . PM localization of clathrin and genetic analysis of chc loss of function mutants and dominant negative clathrin lines in Arabidopsis [ 4 , 13 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 14 (cid:2) , 15 ] ﬁrmly established the conserved mechanism of CME as a fun - damental process required for plant growth and devel - opment . Adaptor complexes—scaffolds of CCV Since clathrin directly binds neither membranes nor car - goes , this scaffolding function at the budding site is taken up by adaptor protein complexes [ 2 ] . Of the four Assembly Polypeptide / Adaptor Protein ( AP , AP1 – 4 ) complexes , the Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2011 , 14 : 674 – 682 www . sciencedirect . com heterotetrameric AP - 2 consisting of two large ( a , b 2 ) subunits , a medium ( m 2 ) and a small ( s 2 ) subunit , is the major adaptor of the clathrin machinery at the PM of animal cells [ 2 ] . The orthologues of different adaptins including AP - 2 components are present in plant genomes [ 16 , 17 ] ( Table 1 ) and recent studies show interaction between m 2 and the cytoplasmic tail of cargo LeEIX2 [ 18 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Similar characterization of AP - 2 function in endo - cytosis is missing despite biochemical characterization suggested its conserved function in CME [ 16 , 19 ] . Apart from the classical adaptins , a large network of accessory proteins also function in linking the cargo as well as membrane lipids to the AP - 2 / clathrin assembly , inﬂuencing actin dynamics and most importantly indu - cing membrane curvature for invagination of the PM into vesicles . In plants , conserved orthologues of animal and yeast adaptor proteins with domains such epsin N - term - inal homology ( ENTH ) , AP180 N - terminal homology ( ANTH ) [ 20 , 21 ] , Eps15 homology domain ( EHDs ) [ 7 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] , and the Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) have been identiﬁed [ 17 , 22 ] and limited biochemical and functional charac - terization link them to CME ( summarized in Table 1 , Figure 2 ) . Others , such as arrestins , are absent suggesting diversity of cargoes in various systems would have favoured evolution of different cargo - speciﬁc adaptors [ 2 , 17 ] . This is exempliﬁed through the identiﬁcation of the plant - speciﬁc adaptin - like protein , TPLATE , which Clathrin - mediated endocytosis Chen , Irani and Friml 675 Figure 1 Dynamin CHC CLC Accessory adaptor proteins Cargoes Uncoating AP - 2 To EE / TGN Ligands β 2 σ 2 μ 2 α Binding Recruitment Maturation Scission Current Opinion in Plant Biology A representative model for CCV formation in plants . Cargoes that need to be internalized from the PM are packaged by the co - operative assembly of the coat proteins that include clathrin , AP2 - complex that consists of a , b 2 , m 2 and s 2 subunits , and associated accessory adaptor proteins recruited to the membrane via the phospholipid PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 to form CCPs . The membrane invaginates as more cargo and adaptor proteins are recruited and clathrin triskelia polymerize to form the cage . Dynamin assembles at the neck of the bud for scission of the CCV from the PM . Once a CCV pinches off , the coat falls off and the uncoated vesicle fuses with EEs / TGN for downstream processing of the cargo . The known components of the coat machinery in plants are represented in Table 1 . The orthologues of uncoating factors have been identified in the plant genomes but not characterized [ 17 ] . www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2011 , 14 : 674 – 682 interacts with clathrin and mediates clathrin - dependent mechanisms for cell plate formation during cytokinesis [ 23 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Cargo selection by the endocytic machinery Adaptor complexes generally recognize cargo proteins by linear motifs and post - translational modiﬁcations such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination [ 24 ] . In animals , the tyrosine - based YxxØ and the dileucine - based [ DE ] xxxL [ LI ] motifs are recognized by the sub - units of the AP - 2 complex [ 24 ] . The YxxØ motif in plants is recognized by the m 2 adaptin [ 16 ] and functions not only as a signal for ligand - induced endocytosis of LeEIX2 [ 7 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] but also for the localization and degradation of BOR1 [ 8 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Furthermore , the tyrosine and di - leucine motifs in KORRIGAN , an endo - 1 , 4 - beta glucanase required for cell wall modiﬁcation , determines its localization to the cell plate [ 25 ] . Tyrphostin A23 ( TyrA23 ) , a pharmaco - logical inhibitor that interferes with the cargo YxxØ motif recognition [ 26 ] , is one of the few drugs commonly used to interfere with endocytosis in plants [ 4 , 9 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 27 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Phosphorylation and ubiquitination have been documen - ted in animal and yeast systems as endocytosis cues that 676 Cell biology Table 1 CME components in Arabidopsis Components AGI number in Arabidopsis Interactome Functions References Clathrin CHC At3g11130 ( CHC1 ) TPLATE , SH3P , EPSIN , EPSINR Clathrin triskelion formation [ 10 , 14 (cid:2) , 22 , 23 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 67 , 68 ] At3g08530 ( CHC2 ) CLC At2g40060 ( CLC1 ) At2g20760 ( CLC2 ) At3g51890 ( CLC3 ) AP - 2 complex a At5g22770 Lipids , EHD2 , DRPs , AP180 , Clathrin A recruitment core for linking lipids , cargo , and adaptor proteins to clathrin triskelion .

Phosphorylation is important not only for ligand - induced receptor - mediated signaling as seen with the LRR - RLKs BRI1 and FLS2 , but also for their trafﬁcking [ 6 , 28 , 29 ] . Furthermore , phosphorylation is also an import - ant signal for the polar , PM localization of constitutively endocytosed PIN auxin transporters [ 30 , 31 ] . It is unclear how PIN phosphorylation regulate their polarity but it might serve as a signal for PIN recruitment into endocytic or polar recycling pathways [ 32 (cid:2) ] . As in animal and yeast systems , plants may also utilize these phosphorylated cytoplasmic domains as phospho - scaffolds to recruit adaptor and regulatory proteins , the identity of which in plants remains unknown . Generally , ubiquitination serves as a signal for endocy - tosis and further sorting of cargo destined for degradation through the ESCRT machinery [ 33 ] . PM proteins such as PIN2 [ 34 ] , the aquaporin PIP2 [ 35 ] , FLS2 [ 36 (cid:2) ] , BOR1 [ 37 ] and IRT1 [ 9 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] are ubiquitinitated in vivo . Notably , integrated circuits for phosphorylation - dependent poly - ubiquitylation are essential for ﬂagellin - induced FLS2 degradation mediated through U - Box E3 ubiquitin ligases [ 6 , 36 (cid:2) ] . Similarly , U - Box E3 ligases were found to interact with a number of RLKs in plants [ 38 ] , and may potentially function as adaptors or , alternatively , recruit adaptor proteins [ 33 ] . However , a clear link between phosphorylation and ubi - quitination and the endocytic machinery in plants still needs to be established as plant orthologues of known animal and yeast adaptor proteins that recognize these marks are not encoded by plant genomes [ 24 , 33 ] . Dynamin—scission for CCV departure Following clathrin and cargo recruitment to PM , matured CCPs need to detach and depart from the PM . This process is mediated by dynamins , a large family of GTPase proteins that regulate membrane scission and tubulation [ 2 ] . In plants , of the six dynamin related protein ( DRP ) families , DRP1 and DRP2 were shown to be involved in clathrin - mediated membrane trafﬁcking [ 39 ] ( Table 1 ) . The interaction of DRP2A with accessory adaptor proteins , ultrastructural localization to clathrin cages , plus genetic and localization analyses provide evidence for the role of DRPs in CME [ 13 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 15 , 39 , 40 ] ( Figure 2 ) . Furthermore , a recent study shows DRP1 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis Chen , Irani and Friml 677 Figure 2 Current Opinion in Plant Biology Lipids Cargoes EPSIN / EPSINR Clathrin - mediated endocytosis EHD2 AP180 SH3P AP2 DRP1 Actin DRP2 Uncoating factors ARF - GAP TPLATE Microtubule Clathrin The CME interactome in plants . AP - 2 and clathrin are the core components in the interaction network . The interactions between protein – protein , protein – lipid , or protein – actin , protein – microtubule are plotted as indicated in Table 1 . Solid lines represent experimentally detected interactions in plants , dotted lines represent interactions that are proved in animals or yeast . TPLATE is a plant - specific adaptin - like protein marked in green . The function of EPSIN / EPSINR in CME is still unknown as EPINRs were shown to be involved in trafficking to the vacuole [ 67 , 68 ] . The plant network is quite sparse as compared to the animal network represented in www . endocytosis . org . www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2011 , 14 : 674 – 682 association with PIN proteins and their role in PIN re - distribution from the cell plate after cell division [ 41 (cid:2) ] . High resolution live cell dynamics of the DRP1 and DRP2 with clathrin at PM foci show similarities to animal clathrin – dynamin dynamics where dynamin is recruited to PM foci after clathrin and both disassemble together after scission [ 13 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Although , direct evidence is still lacking , all these observations strongly suggest that plant dynamin - related proteins play a similar role in scission of CCVs as established in non - plant models ( see CME interactome network in Figure 2 ) . Small GTPase control of CME In animals and yeast , beside dynamins , another type of GTPase , the ADP ribosylation factor ( ARF ) small GTPase , together with their regulators , the guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and the GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) are known to play a role in clathrin - dependent endocytosis [ 2 , 42 ] . In plants , an ARF - GAP , VASCULAR NETWORK DEFECTIVE 3 ( VAN3 ) , was identiﬁed to interact with the dynamin DRP1A [ 43 ] , and together with the ARF - GEF GNOM co - localized with clathrin foci at the PM [ 44 (cid:2) ] . Both these factors along with another ARF - GEF GNL1 and ARF1 itself were shown to be required for endocytosis [ 45 ] . These observations suggest that besides their function at intracellular compartments [ 45 , 46 ] , the ARF GTPase machinery also plays a role in CME [ 44 (cid:2) ] but its exact role remains to be determined . Furthermore , another small GTPase of the Rab class , the plant orthologue of the mammalian Rab5 , ARA7 has been associated with endocytosis [ 47 ] . Despite its localization at rather later endocytic compartments [ 47 ] , dominant negative manipulation of this regulator presumably also indirectly inhibits also early stages of endocytosis [ 48 ] . Role of membrane composition and cytoskeleton in CCV formation Besides the bona ﬁde molecular regulators involved in CME , common structural components of cells such as membrane composition and cytoskeleton play roles in this process . The lipid signature of membranes provides spatial landmarks for cargo selection and recruitment of the endo - cytic machinery to correct membranes [ 2 ] . Animals and yeast utilize , in particular , the phosphoinositide phospha - tidylinositol 4 , 5 bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) to recruit clathrin coat proteins to the PM through interactions with lipid binding domains in AP - 2 and accessory adaptor proteins [ 2 ] ( Figure 2 ) . Similarly , in plants PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 levels directly inﬂuence the recruitment of clathrin to the PM [ 49 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 50 ] . This , put together with the presence of the lipid binding PH domains in a number of endocytic regulatory proteins suchasDRPs , ARF - GAPs [ 51 ] andbindingoftheaccessory adaptor protein SH3Ps to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 [ 22 ] , further supports the view that , as in animals , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 in plants indeed serves as a recruiting platform for the CME machinery . Sterols are an integral part of all membranes , marking microdomains and inﬂuencing the ﬂuidity of the mem - brane . Genetic or pharmacological manipulation of sterol content of the PM interferes with endocytosis [ 52 ] . Furthermore , sterol - dependent clathrin and dynamin - mediated endocytosis inﬂuences cytokinesis and maintains the localization of cargoes , such as the syntaxin KNOLLE , to the cell division zone [ 53 (cid:2) ] . However , it remains to be seen whether sterols function as lipid rafts to enrich cargoes to follow either a CME or CIE endocytic route . In animals , the initial site of endocytosis is marked by recruitment of coat proteins and actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( ARP2 / 3 ) that mediates actin assembly [ 2 ] . Actin polymer - ization starts at a developing CCV [ 2 ] . In plants , the role of the cytoskeleton ( particular at early stages of CME ) is much less clear [ 54 ] . Generally , there are few observations linking actin to CME . Stabilizing actin dynamics inhibits endocytosis [ 55 ] ; the adaptor accessory protein SH3P1 associates with actin [ 22 ] ; overexpression of another type of adaptor accessory protein ( EHD ) disrupts actin dynamics [ 18 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . The function of microtubules in endocy - tosis is even less clear , rather they have been implicated in trafﬁcking during cytokinesis [ 23 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 56 ] . Thus , the role of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in CME and their interacting networks still need to be discovered . Roles of CME in plant development Plants use endocytosis , besides for house - keeping cellular functions , as one of the many regulatory layers to control their physiology , to organize their body plan and respond to the environment . Examples of the role of endocytosis , in particular CME , in plant development are as follows . The polarly localized PIN auxin efﬂux carriers form the prototype to study the plant endocytic trafﬁcking machin - ery . PIN proteins were the ﬁrst identiﬁed cargoes of CME [ 4 ] and endocytosis has been shown to be essential for initial PIN polarity establishment and re - establishment after cell division [ 14 (cid:2) , 41 (cid:2) , 48 , 52 ] . Studies on PIN proteins also revealed an important plant - speciﬁc mechanism for regulating endocytosis by exogenous stimuli such as gravity [ 57 (cid:2) ] or by the hormone auxin [ 58 ] . This auxin regulation targets clathrin recruitment to the PM via non - transcriptional signaling dependent on presumably extra - cellular AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN1 ( ABP1 ) [ 27 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Downstream effectors of ABP1 regulation of endocytosis might be Rho - GTPase of plants ( ROPs ) as shown for ABP1 - mediated polarity of leaf epidermal cells [ 59 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . These studies and in particular analysis of mutants in genes coding for CHC ﬁrmly established the role of CME in auxin - mediated development [ 14 (cid:2) ] . The endocytic regulationof plant defense responses is well established , where bacterial and fungal elicitors induce a hypersensitive response through their pattern recognition receptor activation and subsequent endocytosis [ 60 ] . 678 Cell biology Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2011 , 14 : 674 – 682 www . sciencedirect . com Evidence of CME in plant innate immunity comes from studies of tomato LeEIX2 harboring YXX F motifs . LeEIX2 in a network with the AP - 2 adaptor and the accessory adaptor protein EHD2 regulates its ligand - induced endocytosis and immune responses [ 7 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 18 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Further , the oomycete elicitor , cryptogein induces endo - cytosis , in particular CME and defense responses in tobacco cells [ 61 ] . It is likely but remains to be seen if a CME machinery also deﬁnes internalization of the best studied bacterial elicitor ﬂagellin ﬂg22 - FLS2 receptor pair [ 6 , 36 (cid:2) ] . Plants regulate the uptake of nutrients especially essen - tial metal ions that are otherwise toxic in high amounts . The regulated cell surface expression of IRT1 and BOR1 , which constitutively cycle between endosomes and the PM and are sorted into the vacuole for turnover , prevents high iron or boron toxicity [ 8 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 9 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Endocytosis of the iron transporter IRT1 is regulated by monoubiquitination and pharmacological data hint at a potential regulatory role for CME in preventing iron toxicity [ 9 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Similarly , in the case of the boron transporter BOR1 , high levels of boron stimulate BOR1 endocytosis for vacuole degra - dation to avoid excess boron uptake and tyrosine motifs were shown to be essential for polar localization , and together with boron - induced ubiquitination , necessary for vacuolar degradation [ 8 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 37 ] . Another important role of CME is in cell plate formation during cytokinesis . Many PM proteins and cell wall components can also be found at the forming cell plate suggesting that besides the Golgi apparatus - mediated secretory pathway [ 62 ] , endocytosis of the material from the cell surface contributes to cell plate formation pre - sumably deﬁning its new cell boundary identity [ 63 ] . Moreover , genetic or pharmacological inhibition of endo - cytosis leads to cytokinesis defects and endocytosis is enhanced during cytokinesis [ 41 (cid:2) , 63 , 64 ] . Notably , elec - tron tomographic analysis shows CME activity associated with the preprophase band ( PPB ) before the formation of the cell plate [ 64 ] and components of CME such as CLC , DRPs and TPLATE are present at growing cell plates [ 23 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 39 , 41 (cid:2) , 56 ] . These observations suggest that , on one hand endocytosis is required for cytokinesis and brings part of the cargoes to the cell plate and on the other hand that clathrin machinery is present at the cell plate aiding the dynamic trafﬁcking processes there [ 65 ] . Additionally , plants also use CME to regulate high turn - over of membrane in actively growing tip cells as seen in root hairs [ 66 ] and pollen tubes [ 49 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Recent studies show that the proper balance between the phosphoinosi - tides PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 is required for the recruitment of clathrin as well as the accessory adaptor protein AP180 to maintain membrane ﬂow at the tips of actively growing pollen tubes [ 49 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] , establishing a crucial role for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 in plant CME process . Outlook and perspective Plants similar to their metazoan cousins need to regulate the ‘portals of entry’ into the cell [ 3 ] . After decades of controversy about the existence of endocytosis in plants , recent years witnessed ﬁrm establishment of endocytosis as a crucial process involved in many diverse aspects of plant life [ 17 , 60 ] . At the moment , the conserved key components of CME were identiﬁed in plant genomes , many of them biochemically characterized , localized at the subcellular level and their genetic analysis is ongoing . Also many important cargoes of CME were identiﬁed thus contributing to our understanding of the role of CME in different physiological and developmental processes that include plant - speciﬁc roles such as auxin - mediated patterning , nutrient uptake or pathogen defense . Nota - bly , unexpected plant - speciﬁc mechanisms for regulation of endocytosis were identiﬁed such as the regulation by gravity or the plant hormone auxin . Despite the conser - vation of the core of the CME machinery , many accessory components are missing in plant genomes and on the contrary , plant - speciﬁc components such as adaptin - like protein TPLATE were found , highlighting the diversi - ﬁcation of underlying molecular mechanisms between plants and other eukaryotes . Major challenges for coming years will include ( i ) con - solidation of our knowledge on the core mechanisms of clathrin - mediated and clathrin - independent endocyto - sis and identiﬁcation / characterization of regulators unique for plants , ( ii ) identiﬁcation of so far unknown developmental and physiological roles for endocytosis in plants , ( iii ) the identiﬁcation of entry points for plant - speciﬁc regulation by endogenous signals such as hor - mones and environmental cues such as pathogen attack , nutrient availability or light and gravity , ( iv ) elucidation of in vivo dynamics and interaction networks of these components . Addressing these issues and with use of advanced tech - niques such as high - resolution imaging , the still some - what vague CME network in plants will take more concrete shape and help us understand how an originally common mechanism has been adapted for different eukaryotes .

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2010 , 107 : 6094 - 6099 . The authors demonstrate livecell clathrin – dynamin dynamics at the PM in Arabidopsis using time - lapse variable incidence angle ﬂuorescent micro - scopy ( VIAFM ) . DRP2B and DRP1A are recruited to CLC foci and dis - appear together at the same time . The structurally different DRP1A and DRP2B interact with each other and TyrA23 disturbs dynamics of DRP1A but not DRP2B suggesting different characteristics of the two dynamin families . 14 .

The role of CME in the internalization of LeEIX2 is further supported in this publication by the YXXØ motif - dependent interaction of its cytoplasmic tail with AP - 2 m 2 subunit and s 2 with EHD2 . EHD2 expression inﬂuences actin dynamics and the authors suggest its inhibitory function on LeEIX2 endocytosis through modulation of actin dynamics . 19 .

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2011 , 108 : 615 - 620 . The authors show that a plant - speciﬁc adaptin - like protein TPLATE - dependent CME is required for cell plate formation during cytokinesis .

Cell 2010 , 143 : 111 - 121 . The authors demonstrate that ABP1 auxin receptor mediates a non - transcriptional auxin signaling to regulate CME . In the absence of auxin , ABP1 recruits clathrin to the PM , thereby promoting endocytosis . When auxinbindsto ABP1 , itinterferes withtherecruitmentofclathrinandleads to the inhibition of CME of PIN proteins . The study puts forward a CME - dependent auxin feedback regulation for its own transport . 28 .

Plant Cell 2009 , 21 : 3839 - 3849 . The authors demonstrate that phosphorylation of the PIN hydrophilic loops is involved in its internalization and polar recycling by ARF - GEFs . Analyses of phosphorylation gain - of - function 35S : PID line and the ARF - GEF loss - of - function gnom mutant indicate PID and GNOM have oppo - site functions in PIN polarity and auxin distribution regulation . Further , gain of PID kinase and loss of PP2A phosphatase activity both result in PIN recruitment to a BFA - insensitive apical targeting pathway , suggest that PIN phosphorylation mediates not only PIN polarity but also deter - mines the rate of PIN recycling . This ﬁnding demonstrates phosphory - lated PINs are recruited into a BFA - insensitive / GNOM - independent pathway and the non - phosphorylated PINs are recruited into a BFA - sensitive / GNOM - dependent pathway . 33 .

Analysis of drp1a and drp1c mutants show auxin - related developmental phenotypes , altered cell plates , affected PIN polarity and inhibited the selective retrival of PIN from the cell plate . They propose the DRP1 group of dynamins as part of the CME mechanism for rapid retrival of PIN proteins from the cell plate during and immediately after cytokinesis to re - establish their polar localization . 42 .

Plant Cell 2010 , 22 : 4031 - 4044 . This elegant study ﬁrmly establishes the role of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 in CME during pollen tube tip growth . Overexpression of PIP5K6 caused PM deforma - tion , reduced FM4 - 64 dye internalization and increased recruitment of AP180 at pollen tube tip . Expression of the dominant negative clathrin HUB domain , PI4K b 1 and PLC2 could rescue the PIP5K6 overexpression phenotype . The inhibition of CHC recruitment to PM by analysis of RNAi PIP5K6 and pip5k4 mutant suggested PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 production via PIP5Ks is important for CCV formation in the apical PM of pollen tube Thus the proper balance between PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 is required for CME regula - tion of pollen tube tip growth . 50 .
