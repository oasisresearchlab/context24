3824 Research Article Introduction Eukaryotic cells internalize cell - surface proteins by endocytosis . Endocytosed proteins are first delivered to the multifunctional organelles often referred to as sorting or early endosomes ( EE ) . From there , proteins are either recycled back to the plasma membrane or transported to late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation . Sorting and recycling of endocytosed proteins are required for proper cellular function and growth , yet we still understand little about the mechanisms involved . Quantitative analyses of membrane proteins ( such as the transferrin receptor ) trafficking through endosomes demonstrate that a variety of alternative pathways exist . Thus , although pulse - chase experiments show that internalized proteins can recycle rapidly ( with half - life between 2 . 5 and 7 minutes ) , continuous incubations show that longer loading times result in linear , cumulative uptake for up to 40 minutes . Based on these studies , recycling is traditionally divided into ‘slow’ ( perinuclear endosome - dependent ) and ‘fast’ ( recycling directly from peripheral endosomes ) pathways ( Maxfield and McGraw , 2004 ; Mellman , 1996 ; Robinson et al . , 1996 ) . Although the functional separation between these two recycling pathways remains to be fully understood , it is believed that the fast recycling pathway mediates constitutive protein recycling , whereas the slow recycling pathway mediates a targeted and / or regulated recycling pathway . Rab 11 GTPase has emerged as an important regulator of endocytic transport ( Grosshans et al . , 2006 ; Jordens et al . , 2005 ) and was shown to regulate a slow recycling pathway ( Filipeanu et al . , 2006 ; Prekeris , 2003 ; Ullrich et al . , 1996 ; van der Sluijs et al . , 1992 ; Ward et al . , 2005 ) . Accumulating evidence also suggests that Rab11 regulates the polarized recycling of proteins during directional cell migration , cytokinesis and in polarized epithelia ( Casanova et al . , 1999 ; Pelissier et al . , 2003 ; Powelka et al . , 2004 ; Skop et al . , 2001 ; Wang et al . , 2000 ; Wilson et al . , 2004 ; Yoon et al . , 2005 ) . Rab GTPases work by recruiting various effector proteins to target membranes . Thus , the recruitment of different effector molecules may be the basis for the involvement of Rab11 in regulating distinct endocytic membrane pathways . Consistent with this idea , several Rab11 - interacting proteins have been identified : Rab11BP / Rabphillin - 11 , Rip11 / FIP5 , RCP / FIP1 , FIP2 , FIP3 , FIP4 , sec15 ( exocyst complex subunit ) and myosin Vb ( Hales et al . , 2001 ; Hales et al . , 2002 ; Hickson et al . , 2003 ; Lindsay et al . , 2002 ; Prekeris et al . , 2001 ; Prekeris et al . , 2000 ; Zhang et al . , 2004 ) . All these effectors are grouped in a family of proteins , known as FIPs ( Rab11 - family - interacting proteins ) and are classified into two main classes ( Prekeris , 2003 ; Tarbutton et al . , 2005 ) . Class I FIPs ( Rip11 / FIP5 , RCP / FIP1 and FIP2 ) contain a C2 domain at the N - terminus and interact with Rab11 GTPases in a GTP - dependent manner with an affinity of 50 - 200 nM ( Eathiraj et al . , 2006 ; Junutula et al . , 2004 ) . These interactions are mediated by a highly conserved Rab11 - binding domain ( RBD ) situated at the C - terminus of each FIP ( Hales et al . , 2001 ; Prekeris et al . , 2001 ) . Rab11 - FIP protein complexes appear to work by recruiting additional proteins to endocytic membranes . High - resolution structural analyses of FIP2 - Rab11 and FIP3 - Rab11 protein complexes show that , upon binding to Rab11 and recruitment to Sorting and recycling of endocytosed proteins are required for proper cellular function and growth . Internalized receptors either follow a fast constitutive recycling pathway , returning to the cell surface directly from the early endosomes , or a slow pathway that involves transport via perinuclear recycling endosomes . Slow recycling pathways are thought to play a key role in directing recycling proteins to specific locations on cell surfaces , such as the leading edges of motile cells . These pathways are regulated by various Rab GTPases , such as Rab4 and Rab11 . Here we characterize the role of Rip11 / FIP5 , a known Rab11 - binding protein , in regulating endocytic recycling . We use a combination of electron and fluorescent microscopy with siRNA - based protein knockdown to show that Rip11 / FIP5 is present at the peripheral endosomes , where it regulates the sorting of internalized receptors to a slow recycling pathway . We also identify kinesin II as a Rip11 / FIP5 - binding protein and show that it is required for directing endocytosed proteins into the same recycling pathway . Thus , we propose that the Rip11 / FIP5 - kinesin - II complex has a key role in the routing of internalized receptors through the perinuclear recycling endosomes .

In addition , it was shown that different FIPs bind to distinct sets of membrane - traffic - regulating proteins . Thus for instance , Class II FIPs ( FIP3 and FIP4 ) were shown to interact with Arf6 GTPase and the formation of Rab11 - FIP3 / 4 - Arf6 complex is required for cell division ( Fielding et al . , 2005 ; Shin et al . , 2001 ) . Class I FIPs , however , interact with proteins that are known to regulate endocytic membrane recycling in polarized cells , motile fibroblasts and leukocytes ( Hales et al . , 2002 ; Naslavsky et al . , 2006 ) . Although recent reports have implicated FIP2 and RCP / FIP1 in regulating various endocytic transport steps , the role of Rip11 / FIP5 , the third member of the Class I subfamily , remains unclear . Since Rip11 / FIP5 is present predominantly in apically localized endosomes in polarized epithelial cells ( Prekeris et al . , 2000 ) , it is likely that Rip11 / FIP5 is also involved in endocytic protein transport and targeting . In this study , we use a combination of electron and fluorescent microscopy with siRNA - based protein knockdown to show that Rip11 / FIP5 is present at the peripheral tubular endosomes where it mediates protein sorting to a slow recycling pathway . We also identify kinesin II as a Rip11 / FIP5 - binding protein . Therefore , we propose that the Rip11 / FIP5 and kinesin II protein complex is required for protein sorting to the recycling endosome - mediated slow recycling pathway . Results Rip11 / FIP5 is localized to peripheral tubular endosomes Up to now , the localization of Rip11 / FIP5 in non - polarized cells has not been properly investigated . We therefore determined the localization of Rip11 / FIP5 by staining HeLa cells with antibodies against Rip11 / FIP5 and various endocytic markers , such as Lamp1 ( late endosomes / lysosomes ) , Golgin - 97 ( trans - Golgi network , TGN ) and EEA1 ( early endosomes ) . Rip11 / FIP5 did not colocalize with any of these markers ( data not shown ) , a finding consistent with published work showing that Rip11 / FIP5 is recruited to endosomes by binding to Rab11 , a GTPase enriched in perinuclear recycling endosomes and tubular extensions of early endosomes ( Junutula et al . , 2004 ) . To explore this further we treated HeLa cells with antibodies against Rip11 / FIP5 and the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) . As shown in Fig . 1A - F , Rip11 / FIP5 partially colocalized with TfR . However , although some TfR - containing endosomes also stained for Rip11 / FIP5 ( Fig . 1D - F , arrowheads ) , a significant number of TfR - containing endosomes did not contain detectable Rip11 / FIP5 . Overall colocalization was modest , with only 22±4 . 3 % of TfR endosomes overlapping with Rip11 / FIP5 . By contrast , 76 . 3±8 . 2 % of Rip11 / FIP5 - containing organelles were also positive for TfR . Interestingly , Rip11 / FIP5 was often enriched on the subdomains of larger TfR - containing endosomes ( Fig . 1D - F , arrows ) . These data suggest that Rip11 / FIP5 may regulate transport only in a distinct subset of the TfR - containing endosomes . To investigate Rip11 / FIP5 localization further , we loaded HeLa cells with Tf - HRP conjugate ( for 45 minutes at 37°C ) and analyzed Rip11 / FIP5 localization ( Rip11 / FIP5 was labeled with 10 nm immunogold ) using electron microscopy ( Fig . 1G , H ) . Most of the Rip11 / FIP5 label was localized to tubular endosomes containing TfR ( identified by the electron - dense precipitate of the reaction product derived from HRP activity ) . Some Rip11 / FIP5 could be observed clustered on the subdomains of Tf - HRP - containing endosomes . Consistent with immunofluorescence microscopy , very little Rip11 / FIP5 labeling could be found on late endosomes ( see inset in Fig . 1G ) or lysosomes ( data not shown ) . Rip11 / FIP5 mediates the transport of TfR to the slow recycling pathway Next , we used siRNA - dependent Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown to measure TfR endocytic traffic in HeLa cells . To eliminate the possibility of the off - target effects , most experiments were confirmed using two different Rip11 / FIP5 siRNAs ( supplementary Fig . 1 . Rip11 / FIP5 is enriched in peripheral recycling endosomes . ( A - F ) HeLa cells were plated on collagen - coated glass coverslips fixed and stained with anti - TfR ( B , C , E , F , red ) or anti - Rip11 / FIP5 ( A , C , D , F , green ) antibodies .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3826 material Fig . S1 ) . Initially we measured the uptake of Tf – Alexa - Fluor - 488 ( Tf - Alexa488 ) in mock - transfected cells or in cells transfected with Rip11 / FIP5 siRNA . Consistent with our previous reports , Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown resulted in a significant increase in Tf internalization ( Fig . 2A ) compared with the knockdown of RCP / FIP1 , which resulted in the inhibition of Tf uptake ( Peden et al . , 2004 ) . By contrast , lysosomal degradation of BSA and internalization of EGF receptor ( EGF - R ) were not affected Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 22 ) ( supplementary material Fig . S3 ) . Increase in Tf uptake can be caused by changes in cellular TfR levels , or changes in rates of internalization and / or recycling . As shown in Fig . 2B ( see also supplementary material Figs S1 and S2 ) , Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown increased plasma membrane levels of TfR , but it had no effect on total cellular TfR levels . The increase was specific to actively recycling proteins , because plasma membrane levels of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) were not affected by Rip11 / FIP5 depletion ( supplementary material Fig . S3 ) . Furthermore , although Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown had no effect on the half - life of Tf internalization and recycling ( Fig . 2A , C , D ) , Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown increased the amount of Tf uptake and recycling ( Fig . 2C , D ) . In summary , these data suggest that Rip11 / FIP5 depletion results in an increase in the number of TfRs in the rapidly recycling endocytic carriers , thus increasing the amount of Tf internalized and recycled . To confirm that Rip11 / FIP5 regulates the number of TfRs actively reccycling between the endocytic compartment and the plasma membrane , we tested the effect of Rip11 / FIP5 siRNA knockdown on the relative distributions of Tf - Alexa594 ( loaded at 37°C for 30 minutes ) and anti - TfR antibodies . As shown in Fig . 3A - F , in mock - transfected cells only 68 . 3±3 . 8 % of TfR colocalized with Tf - Alexa594 . By contrast , almost 100 % of Tf - Alexa594 colocalized with TfR , although the ratio between Tf - Alexa594 and TfR levels varied considerably between different endosomes ( Fig . 3A - F ) . These data suggest that a subpopulation of TfR does not actively recycle to the plasma membrane , probably representing the previously described ‘slow’ recycling pool . To test whether Rip11 / FIP5 regulates the transport of TfR between slow and fast recycling pools , we analyzed Tf - Alexa594 and TfR colocalization in HeLa cells treated with Rip11 / FIP5 siRNA . As shown in Fig . 3G - L , Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown increased the colocalization between TfR and Tf - Alexa594 to 81 . 2±3 . 4 % ( significantly different from control at P < 0 . 05 ) . It is noteworthy that Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown also resulted in accumulation of TfR in large organelles that could represent early endosomes . To test this , we incubated mock - transfected or Rip11 / FIP5 siRNA - treated cells with Tf - Alexa488 for 30 minutes at 37°C and analyzed its colocalization with the early endosome marker EEA1 . As shown in Fig . 4A - C , after a 30 minute incubation , the majority of Tf - Alexa488 was present in perinuclear recycling endosomes , with some Tf - Alexa488 also present at the tips of the Fig . 2 . Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown increases Tf uptake . ( A ) HeLa cells treated with mock siRNA , Rip11 / FIP5 siRNA1 or Rip11 / FIP5 siRNA2 were incubated at 37°C with Tf - Alexa488 .

( B ) Mock - treated or Rip11 / FIP5 siRNA - treated HeLa cells were fixed and incubated with 80 μ g / ml Tf - Alexa488 in the absence or presence of 0 . 4 % saponin . Cells were then washed and plasma - membrane - associated ( non - permeabilized cells , see figure ) and total cellular ( permeabilized cells , not shown ) Tf - Alexa488 measured by flow cytometry . The data shown are the mean ± s . d . of three independent experiments . ( C ) Mock - and Rip11 / FIP5 siRNA1 - treated HeLa cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes with Tf - Alexa488 . Cells were then washed and incubated at 37°C with unlabeled Tf . Cell - associated Tf - Alexa488 was measured by flow cytometry and is shown as arbitrary units .

Data are the mean ± s . d . calculated from three different experiments . * P < 0 . 02 . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3827 Rip11 / FIP5 binds to kinesin Il cells . Only a small portion of Tf - Alexa488 ( 11 . 2±1 . 2 % ) was present in early endosomes , as shown by partial colocalization with EEA1 . The Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown caused a decrease in Tf - Alexa488 localization in perinuclear recycling endosomes and an increase in colocalization of Tf - Alexa488 and EEA1 ( Fig . 4D - F ) ( 35 . 3±2 . 8 % ) . Interestingly , in Rip11 / FIP5 - knockdown cells , the amount of Tf - Alexa488 present at the tips of the cells did not seem to change ( Fig . 4D - F ) . Since these organelles did not stain with anti - EEA1 antibody , they are unlikely to be early endosomes , suggesting that Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown has not completely blocked the exit of Tf from early endosomes , but does , probably , affect the transfer of Tf from early endosomes to the perinuclear recycling endosomes . Kinesin II is a Rip11 / FIP5 - binding protein To discover new Rip11 / FIP5 - binding proteins we screened a human kidney cDNA library using a yeast two - hybrid assay . Five clones isolated during this screen encoded the C - terminal fragments of Kif3B , a component of the kinesin II molecular motor . Kinesin II is a microtubule molecular motor that consists of a Kif3A and Kif3B heterodimer that is associated with a single molecule of KAP3A ( Cole et al . , 1992 ; Cole et al . , 1993 ) . All isolated Kif3B clones included the C - terminal tail domain , which is thought to mediate kinesin - cargo interactions . Thus , we tested whether Kif3B ( 524 - 747 ) ( Kif3B - tail ) can bind to Rip11 / FIP5 . As shown in the supplementary material Fig . S6A , Rip11 / FIP5 but not RCP / FIP1 interacted with Kif3B - tail . Interestingly , no binding was observed to KAP3A , suggesting that Rip11 / FIP5 binds directly to Kif3B rather than through KAP3 ( supplementary material Fig . S6A ) , has been reported for some other kinesin II cargo molecules ( Jimbo et al . , 2002 ; Takeda et al . , 2000 ) . Next , we evaluated whether Rab11 regulates Rip11 / FIP5 binding to Kif3B . To this end we tested the Rip11 / FIP5 - Y629A mutant for its ability to bind Kif3B - tail . We have previously reported that Rip11 / FIP5 - Y629 plays a key role in its binding to Rab11 ( Junutula et al . , 2004 ) . The Rip11 / FIP5 - Y629A mutant still bound to the Kif3B - tail as tested by a yeast two - hybrid assay ( supplementary material Fig . S6B ) . Although Rab11 did not seem to affect Rip11 / FIP5 binding to Kif3B , it is still possible that Rab11 might bind to either Kif3B or KAP3 , thus increasing the specificity and / or affinity of Rip11 / FIP5 - Rab11 complex interaction with kinesin II . We then tested whether Rab11 could independently bind to Kif3B or KAP3 , but neither wild - type Rab11 nor Rab11 mutants ( dominant - negative or constitutively active ) interacted with Kif3B or KAP3 ( supplementary material Fig . S6C ) . In vivo , kinesin II exists as a heterotrimeric protein complex consisting of Kif3A - Kif3C - KAP3 or Kif3A - Kif3B - KAP3 proteins . Thus , we tested whether Rip11 / FIP5 can bind all three Kif3 isoforms . Rip11 / FIP5 bound to GST - Kif3A , B and C , but not GST alone ( Fig . 5A , B ) . To identify the Kif3B - binding domain in Rip11 / FIP5 , we purified the Rip11 / FIP5 ( 490 - 652 ) fragment that was previously shown to contain the Rab11 - binding domain ( Meyers and Prekeris , 2002 ; Junutula et al . , 2004 ) . Consistent with yeast two - hybrid data , Rip11 / FIP5 ( 490 - 652 ) bound to GST - Kif3B - tail , but not GST alone ( Fig . 5C ) . Furthermore , addition of excess soluble wild - type Rab11 did not affect Rip11 / FIP5 and Kif3B - tail binding ( Fig . 5C ) , suggesting that Rab11 and Kif3B bind to distinct and non - overlapping sites . Consistent with this , constitutively active Rab11 ( Q70L ) or dominant - negative Rab11 ( S25N ) had no effect on Rip11 / FIP5 binding to GST - Kif3B - tail ( data not shown ) . Rab11 Fig . 3 . Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown increases colocalization of Tf with TfR . Mock - treated ( A - F ) or Rip11 siRNA1 - treated ( J - L ) HeLa cells were loaded for 30 minutes at 37°C with 5 μ g / ml Tf - Alexa594 ( B , C , E , F , H , I , K , L , red ) . Cells were then washed fixed and stained with anti - TfR antibodies ( A , C , D , F , G , I , J , L , green ) . Yellow in C , F , I and L represents the overlap between Tf - Alexa594 and TfR . D - F and J - L are higher magnification images of boxed areas of mock - treated and Kif3B siRNA1 - treated cells , respectively . Scale bars : 5 μ m ( A , G ) and 1 μ m ( D , J ) . Arrowheads in D - F indicate organelles enriched in Tf - Alexa594 . Arrows in D - F indicate organelles containing TfR but little Tf - Alexa594 . Arrowheads in J - L point to large organelles enriched in TfR and Tf - Alexa594 . Numbers in A and G give the percentage overlap between TfR and Tf - Alexa594 . The data are mean ± s . d . overlap in 25 randomly chosen cells from three different experiments . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3828 was also pulled down with GST - Kif3B beads , but only in the presence of Rip11 / FIP5 ( 490 - 652 ) ( Fig . 5C and data not shown ) suggesting that Rip11 / FIP5 and Rab11 complex can bind to Kif3B . Kif3B mediates Rip11 / FIP5 binding to microtubules Accumulating evidence suggests that microtubule - dependent motors have an important role in endocytic protein trafficking ( Soldati and Schliwa , 2006 ) and it is of interest therefore that Rip11 / FIP5 - containing endosomes can often be observed aligned in a ‘beads - on - a - string’ manner along microtubules ( supplementary material Fig . S4 ) . To test whether kinesin II mediates recruitment of Rip11 / FIP5 to microtubules , we examined the ability of Rip11 / FIP5 to bind microtubules by in vitro microtubule sedimentation assays . As shown in Fig . 5D , endogenous Rip11 / FIP5 from HeLa Triton X - 100 lysates could be sedimented with microtubules . This interaction was not direct , because recombinant purified Rip11 / FIP5 did not co - sediment with microtubules ( data not shown ) . To test whether molecular motor proteins mediate this interaction , we incubated HeLa cell lysates solubilized with Triton X - 100 , with microtubules in the presence of 5 mM ATP , which is known to dissociate molecular motors from microtubules . ATP decreased Rip11 / FIP5 co - sedimentation with microtubules ( Fig . 5E ) . To test whether molecular motors recruit Rip11 / FIP5 to microtubules , we incubated HeLa cells lysates with microtubules in the absence of ATP , sedimented tubulin and then resuspended and re - sedimented microtubules in the absence or presence of 5 mM ATP ( Fig . 5E , top panel , last two lanes ) . Once again , ATP inhibited Rip11 / FIP5 re - sedimentation with microtubules . The ATP effect on Rip11 / FIP5 co - sedimentation with microtubules suggests that molecular motors , such as kinesins , mediate the Rip11 / FIP5 interaction with tubulin . However , this assay does not determine the identity of this kinesin . To test whether kinesin II mediates Rip11 / FIP5 co - sedimentation with microtubules , we performed the assay either in the presence or absence of recombinant purified Kif3B - tail protein or using Triton X - 100 lysates from HeLa cells treated with Kif3B siRNA . In both cases , we observed a decrease in Rip11 / FIP5 co - sedimentation with Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 22 ) microtubules , suggesting that kinesin II is required for Rip11 / FIP5 binding to microtubules ( Fig . 5E ) . Kinesin II regulates protein traffic to perinuclear recycling endosomes Our data suggest that kinesin II binding to Rip11 / FIP5 might be involved in regulating protein transport to perinuclear recycling endosomes . Although kinesin II has a well - established role in primary cilia generation and maintenance in epithelial cells , as well as lysosomal transport , its role in endocytic recycling remains obscure ( Bananis et al . , 2004 ; Brown et al . , 2005 ; Lin et al . , 2003 ; Soldati and Schliwa , 2006 ; Whitehead et al . , 1999 ) . To this end , we developed two different Kif3B siRNAs , siRNA1 and siRNA2 that resulted in 80 % and 70 % knockdown of Kif3B , respectively ( supplementary material Fig . S1A , C ) . Interestingly , the knockdown of Kif3B also caused the depletion of Kif3A ( the antibody recognizes both kinesin II subunits ) , but not KAP3A ( supplementary material Fig . S1A - C ) . Since Kif3B siRNA1 more efficiently knocked down Kif3A / B , we used it for most of the following experiments . However , to avoid off - target effects , most of the experiments were repeated at least once with Kif3B siRNA2 ( data not shown ) . First , we tested the uptake of Tf - Alexa488 ( to analyze recycling pathways ) as well as the uptake of DQ - BSA - Green ( to analyze lysosomal degradation pathways ) . Similarly to results with Rip11 / FIP5 siRNA , Kif3B knockdown resulted in increased Tf - Alexa488 internalization ( Fig . 6A , C ) , but had no effect on DQ - BSA - Green transport to lysosomes ( supplementary material Fig . S3 ) . Kif3B depletion increased the amount of Tf - Alexa488 uptake and recycling ( Fig . 6A , C ) , but had no effect on the half - life of Tf - Alexa488 recycling ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , Kif3B depletion resulted in an increase in plasma membrane levels of TfR ( Fig . 6B ) . To understand the role of kinesin II in protein recycling , we incubated Kif3B siRNA1 - treated HeLa cells with Tf - Alexa488 . Similarly to Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown , treatment of HeLa cells with Kif3B siRNA resulted in the loss of the tubulated Tf - Alexa488 structures in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 7A ) . Surprisingly , although a small Fig . 4 . Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown increases colocalization of Tf with early endosomes . Mock - treated ( A - C ) or Rip11 siRNA1 - treated ( D - F ) HeLa cells were incubated for 30 minutes with Tf - Alexa488 ( A , D and green in C , F ) . Cells were then washed , fixed and stained with anti - EEA1 antibody ( B , E and red in C , F ) . Yellow colour represents the extent of Tf and EEA1 overlap . Asterisks indicate early endosomes . Insets in C and F are higher magnification images . Numbers in C and F represent the extent of colocalization of Tf - Alexa488 with EEA1 . The numbers are the mean ± s . d . from ten random cells . Scale bars : 4 μ m . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3829 Rip11 / FIP5 binds to kinesin Il fraction of Tf - Alexa488 could be found in EEA1 - containing early endosomes ( Fig . 7A - C , inset ) , the majority of Tf - Alexa488 was present in the endocytic structures located at the tips of the cells ( Fig . 7A - C ) . These structures also contained other endocytic proteins , such as Rab11 , Rab4 , RCP / FIP1 , FIP2 and Rip11 / FIP5 ( data not shown and supplementary material Fig . S5 ) , but not lysosomal or TGN markers , such as Lamp1 , VAMP7 and Golgin97 . In addition , these organelles are still able to recycle Tf , because Tf - Alexa488 can be chased out of them ( supplementary material Fig . S5D , E ) . All these data suggest that these elements probably belong to the slow perinuclear recycling compartment that is usually observed next to the nucleus . To further understand the role of kinesin II and Rip11 / FIP5 in endocytic recycling , we treated HeLa cells with both Kif3B and Rip11 / FIP5 siRNAs . Knockdown of Kif3B and Rip11 / FIP5 ( for the efficiency of knockdown see supplementary material Fig . S1 ) resulted in partial shift of Tf - Alexa488 from cell tips to cytoplasmic structures ( Fig . 8C , E compare with Fig . 8A , B ) that also contained EEA1 ( data not shown ) . This phenotype is similar to that observed with Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown alone , suggesting that although Rip11 / FIP5 and kinesin II act in the same recycling pathway , Rip11 / FIP5 might have additional functions upstream of kinesin II . Indeed , it has been suggested that FIPs also regulate membrane transport by interacting with multiple proteins in a ‘hand - me - down’ fashion . Discussion A key step in understanding endocytic traffic is the characterization of the role that Rab GTPases and their effector proteins have in regulating protein transport and sorting . Rip11 / FIP5 was originally identified as a Rab11 - binding protein that is enriched at the apical recycling endosomes in polarized epithelial cells ( Prekeris et al . , 2000 ) . Since then , it has become apparent that , although Rip11 / FIP5 is enriched in polarized epithelial cells , it is present in all other cell lines or tissues tested ( Junutula et al . , 2004 ; Peden et al . , 2004 ; Prekeris et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , it is likely that Rip11 / FIP5 function is not limited to endocytic membrane traffic in epithelial cells . Here we show that in non - polarized HeLa cells , Rip11 / FIP5 associates with peripheral tubular endosomes . It is interesting to note that Rip11 / FIP5 can often be observed localized in clusters associated with ‘bud - like’ structures on the endosomes . It is tempting to speculate that these structures could be the sites of budding transport vesicles or tubules . Consistent with this , Rab11 GTPases are enriched in clathrin - coated vesicles ( Borner et al . , 2006 ) . Furthermore , overexpression of Rip11 / FIP5 dominant - negative Fig . 5 . Kinesin II mediates Rip11 / FIP5 binding to microtubules . ( A ) Glutathione beads coated with GST alone , GST - Kif3A - tail , GST - Kif3B - tail or GST - Kif3C - tail were incubated with HeLa cell Triton X - 100 lysates . Beads were then washed and bound Rip11 / FIP5 or RCP / FIP1 was analyzed by immunoblotting . The lower molecular size band present only in the GST lane represents a non - specific band since it did not disappear when we use lysates treated with Rip11 / FIP5 siRNA ( data not shown ) .

Bound Rip11 / FIP5 ( 490 - 652 ) was detected by immunoblotting . ( D , E ) Rip11 / FIP5 binding to microtubules analyzed using microtubule sedimentation assay ( see Materials and Methods ) . Where indicated , assays were performed in the presence off either 5 mM ATP or recombinant Kif3B - tail protein . In the bottom panel , mock - treated or Kif3B siRNA - treated lysates were used in the assay . Fig . 6 . Kif3B knockdown increases Tf uptake .

The data shown are the mean ± s . d . of three independent experiments . * P < 0 . 025 . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3830 mutant causes extensive tubulation of recycling endosomes ( Junutula et al . , 2004 ; Meyers and Prekeris , 2002 ) , suggesting a defect in budding from tubular endosomes . However , whether Rip11 / FIP5 is simply recruited to the budding sites or actively regulates transport vesicle / tubule formation remains to be determined . Perhaps the most intriguing observation is that Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown actually enhances Tf uptake , rather than inhibiting it . The enhancement in Tf uptake was mostly due to the increase in the amount of TfR present in actively recycling endocytic carriers , rather then changes in the half - life of endocytosis or recycling . Consistent with this , Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown increases the amount of TfR at plasma membrane . Furthermore , it also inhibits TfR transfer from early endosomes to perinuclear recycling endosomes . These data suggest that Rip11 / FIP5 mediates perinuclear slow recycling rather than constitutive fast recycling . The functional significance of slow recycling remains to be clarified . The perinuclear recycling endosome is a very heterogeneous compartment that may well contain several functionally distinct endosome components . It is Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 22 ) likely that recycling through the different subcompartments of recycling endosomes is used for specialized or targeted recycling pathways . Indeed , in polarized epithelial cells , a subset of recycling endosomes , also known as apical recycling endosomes ( AREs ) , mediates apical protein targeting ( Hoekstra et al . , 2004 ) . Furthermore , Rab11 and Rip11 / FIP5 mediate apical transport through such AREs ( Casanova et al . , 1999 ; Nedvetsky et al . , 2007 ; Prekeris et al . , 2000 ; Wang et al . , 2000 ) . Similarly , migrating cells produce lamellipodia at their leading edges and the additional membrane - targeted Rab11 - dependent delivery of integrins required for these protrusive processes is thought to be derived from the recycling endosomes ( Powelka et al . , 2004 ; Yoon et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , Rip11 / FIP5 might have a key role in promoting the transfer of trafficking proteins away from constitutive fast to the regulated or targeted slow recycling pathway . Several recent reports suggest that once recruited to the endosomes by binding to Rab11 , FIPs function as scaffolding factors or adaptor molecules that recruit various proteins that regulate membrane transport . Since Rab11 forms mutually exclusive Fig . 7 . Kif3B knockdown results in peripheral accumulation of TfR . ( A - C ) Kif3B siRNA1 - treated cells incubated for 30 minutes with Tf - Alexa488 ( A , C , green ) . Cells were then fixed and stained with anti - EEA1 antibodies ( B , C , red ) . Asterisks in inset in C indicate the early endosomes containing Tf . Yellow in C represents the overlap between Tf - Alexa488 and EEA1 . Scale bar : 5 μ m . Fig . 8 . Rip11 / FIP5 and Kif3B regulate the same recycling pathway . ( A - C ) Mock - treated cells ( A ) or cells treated with Kif3B siRNA1 ( B ) or Kif3B and Rip11 / FIP5 siRNA1 ( C ) were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes with Tf - Alexa488 . Scale bars : 5 μ m . ( D ) Proposed model of roles of Rip11 / FIP5 and kinesin II in mediating transport to the slow storage pool of endocytic recycling . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3831 Rip11 / FIP5 binds to kinesin Il complexes with various FIPs , different FIP - Rab11 complexes could mediate distinct membrane transport pathways . Indeed , in the past few years several proteins that interact specifically with different members of the FIP family have been identified ( Fielding et al . , 2005 ; Hales et al . , 2002 ; Naslavsky et al . , 2006 ) . In this study we identified kinesin II as a molecular motor that binds to Rip11 / FIP5 . We originally identified kinesin II as a putative Rip11 / FIP5 - binding protein by yeast two - hybrid assays and confirmed the binding using glutathione pull - down assays , as well as microtubule co - sedimentation assays . Unfortunately , we could not demonstrate co - immunoprecipitation of kinesin II and Rip11 / FIP5 using either anti - Rip11 or anti - GFP ( in Rip11 - GFP - expressing cells ) antibodies . It is possible that the interaction between Rip11 / FIP3 and kinesin II is either too transient or not strong enough to withstand the immunoprecipitation . Alternatively , microtubule binding might be required to enhance the kinesin II interaction with Rip11 / FIP5 . Several studies have shown that kinesins can auto - inhibit their cargo binding when not associated with microtubules ( Blasius et al . , 2007 ) , usually through the motor head group interacting with the cargo - binding tail domain . Consistent with this , in yeast two - hybrid assays , the tail domain of Kif3B bound to Rip11 more strongly than full - length Kif3B ( data not shown ) . Kinesin II is a well - studied microtubule molecular motor that mediates various cellular processes , including primary cilia formation and maintenance , late endosome transport and cytokinesis ( Brown et al . , 2005 ; Fan and Beck , 2004 ; Haraguchi et al . , 2006 ; Jimbo et al . , 2002 ; Whitehead et al . , 1999 ) . Kinesin II is a heterotrimer that consists of two heavy chains , Kif3B and Kif3A , and a single light chain KAP3 . Kinesin II binds to Rip11 / FIP5 via the tail domains of Kif3B and Kif3A subunits . KAP3 does not mediate Rip11 / FIP5 binding , although we cannot rule out the possibility that it regulates Rip11 / FIP5 and Kif3A / B interactions in vivo by binding to the tail domains of Kif3A / B . Indeed , kinesin II might transport different cargoes by binding either to cargo via KAP3 or directly to the tails of Kif3A / B . The interaction between Rip11 / FIP5 and Kif3A / B suggested that kinesin II is involved in endocytic protein transport . Consistent with this , Kif3B knockdown resulted in an increase in the amount of actively recycling TfR while having little effect on the half - life of endocytosis or recycling . Surprisingly , although Rip11 / FIP5 knockdown resulted in the increased association of TfR with early endosomes , Kif3B knockdown caused an accumulation of endosomes at the tips of cells , suggesting that kinesin II has additional functions in regulating protein recycling . Indeed , it was previously shown that kinesin II also binds to Rab4 ( Imamura et al . , 2003 ) , the GTPase that has been shown to regulate fast recycling from early endosomes to the plasma membrane . What causes the accumulation of endosomes at the tips of the cells ? Since kinesin II is a plus - directed molecular motor , perhaps one would expect Kif3B knockdown to result in endosome accumulation around the microtubule - organizing complex ( MTOC ) . Interestingly , the tips of the cells that contain accumulated endosomes upon Kif3B knockdown are also rich in actin ( data not shown and supplementary material Fig . S7 ) . Recent evidence suggests that the interplay between microtubule motors and actin motors ( myosins ) is a key regulatory step in determining the transport vesicle sorting and recycling . For instance , in melanocytes myosin Va is required for the capture of melanosomes in actin - rich cell protrusions ( Fukuda et al . , 2002 ; Hume et al . , 2002 ; Wu et al . , 2002a ) . The mutation of either myosin Va or its recruiting proteins ( melanophilin and Rab27 ) results in the dispersion of melanosomes in the cytoplasm of the cell ( Wu et al . , 2002b ) . Similarly , Myosin Vb associates with recycling endosomes by binding to FIP2 and Rab11 ( Hales et al . , 2002 ; Lapierre et al . , 2001 ) . Overexpression of myosin Vb dominant - negative inhibitor ( MyoVb - tail ) results in accumulation of endosomes around the MTOC , presumably because they cannot be captured on the actin - rich cell protrusions ( Hales et al . , 2002 ; Lapierre et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , kinesin II may be required for the dissociation of endosomes from the actin cytoskeleton . Consistent with this , actin depolymerization inhibited accumulation of endosomes in the cell periphery induced by Kif3B depletion ( supplementary material Fig . S7 ) . Furthermore , recent reports , as well as our data , suggest that kinesin II and myosin Vb are present on the same endocytic transport vesicles ( Kashina et al . , 2004 ) . Interestingly , in contrast to mammalian cells , Drosophila cells only have one Class I FIP , which binds to myosin V and is known as dRip11 ( Li et al . , 2007 ) . This study raises the interesting possibility that in Drosophila cells , dRip11 might bind to both molecular motors , myosin V and kinesin II , thus allowing the crosstalk between actin - and microtubule - based endosome transport . In summary , we propose that internalized TfR can be recycled either via a ‘slow’ regulated recycling pathway or a ‘fast’ constitutive recycling pathway , which probably represents direct transport from peripheral early endosomes to the plasma membrane . Our data suggest that Rip11 / FIP5 is required for mediating the sorting of proteins to the slow recycling pathway , whereas other FIPs might regulate the recycling from perinuclear recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane or direct transport of proteins from early endosomes to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 8D ) . Rip11 / FIP5 functions , at least in part , by binding to kinesin II . Although the exact role of kinesin II in endocytic recycling remains to be fully understood , our data suggest that it mediates the transport of endocytic carriers as well as regulates differential association of recycling endosomes with microtubule and actin cytoskeletons . Materials and Methods Antibodies Rabbit anti - Rip11 / FIP5 and rabbit anti - RCP / FIP1 antibodies were previously described ( Prekeris et al . , 2000 ; Peden et al . , 2004 ) . Mouse anti - kinesin II antibody was purchased from Covance ( Berkeley , CA ) . Anti - KAP3A antibody was obtained from Transduction laboratories ( San Diego , CA ) . Mouse anti - EEA1 , mouse anti - transferrin receptor and mouse anti - β - tubulin antibodies were from BD Biosciences ( San Jose , CA ) . Rabbit anti - VAMP3 was purchased from Abcam ( Cambridge , MA ) . Secondary antibodies conjugated to either fluorescein or Texas Red were from Jackson ImmunoResearch ( West Grove , PA ) . Transferrin conjugated to Alexa - Fluor - 488 or Alexa - Fluor - 594 was purchased from Molecular Probes / Invitrogen ( Eugene , OR ) . Yeast two - hybrid assays The bait construct was prepared by subcloning full - length Rip11 / FIP5 into the pGBKT7 plasmid . The construct was used to transform AH109 yeast cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Clontech , Palo Alto CA ) . A human kidney cDNA library was screened by mating Y187 yeast cells with AH109 cells expressing Rip11 / FIP5 . Colonies were then checked for growth and β - galactosidase expression by X - gal filter assay . As a further test to eliminate false positives , isolated prey vectors were co - transformed with Rip11 / FIP5 or pGBKT7 alone and checked again for reporter gene expression . For protein interaction studies , a series of bait constructs ( in pGBKT7 vector ) were constructed using the following cDNAs : RCP / FIP1 , Rip11 / FIP5 - Y629A , Kif3B ( 524 - 747 ) - tail , KAP3 . For prey constructs , the following cDNAs were inserted into pACT2 vector : Kif3B , KAP3 , Rab11a , Rab11a - S25N , Rab11a - Q70L . The interaction between bait and prey was measured using liquid β - galactosidase assay according to manufacturer’s protocol ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) . Imaging For imaging , HeLa cells were seeded on collagen - coated coverslips and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes . After fixation , cells were permeabilized with phosphate - buffered saline containing 0 . 4 % saponin , 0 . 2 % BSA and 1 % fetal bovine serum . Cells were subsequently stained using standard immunofluorescence staining procedures and imaged using an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200M deconvolution microscope . Images were processed using Intelligent Imaging Innovations ( Denver , J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3832 Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 22 ) CO ) three - dimensional ( 3D ) rendering and exploration software . For time - lapse microscopy mock - treated or siRNA - treated HeLa cells were plated on collagen - coated coverslips and incubated with 5 μ g / ml of Tf – Alexa - Fluor - 488 for 30 minutes at 37°C . Cells were then washed and mounted on PH2 heated platform fitted with a TC - 344B dual automatic temperature controller ( Warner Instruments ) and imaged as described above . RNA interference RCP / FIP1 siRNA duplexes were previously described ( Peden et al . , 2004 ) . siRNA duplexes for Rip11 / FIP5 ( siRNA1 : 5 (cid:2) - GAGCTGAGTGCTCAGGCTATT - 3 (cid:2) and siRNA2 : 5 (cid:2) - GGGCTGGAGAAGCTCAAAATT - 3 (cid:2) ) ( Peden et al . , 2004 ) and Kif3B ( siRNA1 : 5 (cid:2) - GAAATGCATGGGTAAGGTATT - 3 (cid:2) and siRNA2 : 5 (cid:2) - CGCTAAGG - TGGGTAGCCTATT - 3 (cid:2) ) were based on human sequences . To knock down Rip11 / FIP5 , RCP / FIP1 or Kif3B HeLa cells were transfected with 10 nM HPP grade siRNA ( QIAGEN , Valencia , CA ) using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) based on manufacturer’s protocol . Transfected cells were incubated for 72 hours , plated on collagen - coated coverslips and imaged using fluorescence microscopy or analyzed by immunoblotting and flow cytometry . Expression constructs and protein purification mRFP - tagged myosin Vb tail , GST - Rab11a , GST - Rip11 ( 490 - 652 ) constructs were described previously ( Hales et al . , 2002 ; Meyers and Prekeris , 2002 ) . GST - Kif3A - tail ( 531 - 698 ) , GST - Kif3B - tail ( 524 - 747 ) , GST - Kif3C - tail ( 571 - 793 ) fusion proteins were created by cloning corresponding cDNA into pGEX - KG plasmid ( Amersham Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ ) using Eco RI and Xho I sites . GST - fusion and 6His - fusion proteins were expressed using BL21 - RIPL E . coli strain or baculovirus expression system as described previously ( Junutula et al . , 2004 ; Tarbutton et al . , 2005 ) . Flow cytometry The Tf - and EGFR - uptake assays were done as previously described ( Peden et al . , 2004 ) . Briefly , mock - or siRNA - transfected cells were incubated with 10 μ g / ml Tf - Alexa488 at 4°C for 30 minutes . Cells were then incubated at 37°C for various time intervals in the continuous presence of either 10 μ g / ml Tf - Alexa488 . For EGFR uptake , cells were incubated with anti - EGFR - Alexa594 antibody in the presence of 8 ng / ml of EGF . Cells were then washed once with 0 . 1 M glycine ( pH 3 . 5 ) , followed by two washes with phosphate - buffered saline . The experiment was completed by pelleting and resuspending cells in 3 % paraformaldehyde . Cell - associated Tf - Alexa488 or anti - EGFR - Alexa594 antibody were determined by flow cytometry . For recycling assays , cells were incubated with Tf - Alexa488 for 30 minutes at 37°C . Cells were washed once with 0 . 1 M glycine ( pH 3 . 5 ) , followed by two washes with phosphate - buffered saline . Cells were then incubated in complete medium supplemented with 50 μ g / ml unlabelled Tf at 37°C for various times prior to wash and fixation . Cell - associated Tf - Alexa647 was determined by flow cytometry . To measure plasma - membrane - associated TfR , HeLa cells were fixed with 3 % paraformaldehyde . Cells were then washed and incubated with either 5 μ g / ml anti - TfR - Alexa488 antibody or 80 μ g / ml Tf - Alexa488 in the presence ( to measure total cellular TfR ) or absence ( to measure plasma membrane TfR ) of 0 . 4 % saponin . To measure plasma - membrane - associated EGFR , cells were incubated with anti - EGFR - Alexa594 antibody . Cells were then washed and amount of cell - associated Tf - Alexa488 , anti - TfR - Alexa488 or anti - EGFR - Alexa594 antibody were determined by flow cytometry . DQ - BSA - green degradation assay To measure the lysosomal degradation of soluble proteins we used a DQ - BSA - green degradation assay . DQ - BSA - green is a BSA labeled with a self - quenching fluorescent dye . The hydrolysis of the DQ - BSA - green into single dye - labeled peptides by lysosomal proteases relieves self - quenching , thus allowing us to measure the lysosomal DQ - BSA - green transport . The assay was done according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Molecular Probes / Invitrogen , Eugene , OR ) . Briefly , mock - or siRNA - treated HeLa cells were loaded with 200 μ g / ml DQ - BSA - green for 1 hour at 37°C . Cells were then washed to remove extracellular DQ - BSA - green and incubated at 37°C for 2 hours . The fluorescence of DQ - BSA - green was then monitored by flow cytometry . Electron microscopy For immunoelectron microscopy , HeLa cells were incubated with Tf - HRP for 45 minutes at 37°C before being chilled on ice . The HRP - containing compartments were then preserved by performing the DAB reaction prior to digitonin permeabilization , paraformaldehyde fixation and incubation with rabbit anti - Rip11 / FIP5 , followed by 10 nm gold - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG antibody , essentially as described previously ( Futter et al . , 1998 ) . Thin sections , 60 - 70 nm thick , were cut using a Reichert - Jung Ultracut E microtome , stained with lead citrate and viewed in a Phillips CM12 transmission electron microscope . Some additional images were captured using a Morada CCD camera ( Olympus Soft Imaging Systems ) coupled to a Tecnai G2 Spirit transmission electron microscope ( FEI , The Netherlands ) , running iTEM software . Microtubule sedimentation assay Purified tubulin was polymerized as described in the manufacturer’s protocol provided in the Microtubule Spin - Down Assay kit ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) . Briefly , HeLa cells were lysed in reaction buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 10 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 ) using 1 % Triton X - 100 . Insoluble material was then sedimented and lysates diluted to 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and with a final protein concentration of 1 mg / ml . Purified tubulin was polymerized and stabilized with Taxol . 40 μ l polymerized microtubules ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) were then mixed with 80 μ l of cell lysates and 100 μ l of reaction buffer containing Taxol . As a negative control , tubulin was not added to one of the reactions . Reactions were then incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes . Where indicated , 20 μ g of purified recombinant Kif3B - tail or 5 mM ATP was added . To sediment microtubules , samples were overlaid on 100 μ l cushion buffer ( reaction buffer with 20 % sucrose ) and centrifuged at 45 , 000 r . p . m . for 40 minutes using a TLS55 rotor . Supernatant was aspirated and the supernatant cushion interphase washed with reaction buffer . The microtubule pellet was then resuspended , separated by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotted for the presence of β - tubulin and Rip11 / FIP5 , Kif3B , TfR or KHC . KAP3 , Kif3A , Kif3B , and Kif3C cDNAs were generous gifts from Tetsu Akiyama ( University of Tokyo ) .
