The actin cytoskeleton serves as a paradigm for how equilibrium and non - equilibrium forces combine to give rise to self - organization . Motivated by recent experiments that show that actin ﬁlament growth rates can tune the morphology of a growing actin bundle crosslinked by two competing types of actin binding proteins [ Freedman et al . PNAS 116 , 16192 – 16197 ( 2019 ) ] , we construct a minimal model for such a system and show that the dynamics are subject to a set of thermodynamic constraints that relate the non - equilibrium driving , bundle morphology , and molecular ﬂuxes . The thermodynamic constraints reveal the importance of correlations between these molecular ﬂuxes , and oﬀer a route to estimating microscopic driving forces from microscopy experiments . I . INTRODUCTION Non - equilibrium driving is a crucial prerequisite for the function of many biological systems . Examples include kinetic proofreading [ 1 – 5 ] , adaptation in molecular mo - tors [ 6 – 8 ] , and the suppression of phase decoherence in biochemical oscillators [ 9 – 14 ] , among others . Given the ubiquitous role played by non - equilibrium driving in biol - ogy , much recent work has been focused on establishing the general tradeoﬀs between energy consumption and organization [ 15 – 20 ] . Here , motivated by recent exper - imental work [ 21 – 23 ] , we consider growth and bundling dynamics of actin ﬁlaments and demonstrate that gen - eral energy - speed - morphology relations can be obtained for such systems . The actin cytoskeleton harnesses chemical energy to perform mechanical work that enables cells to migrate , divide , and exert forces on their surroundings , among other functions [ 7 , 24 – 28 ] . To perform these varied func - tions , a cell must be able to control the organization of its many components in both space and time . A grow - ing body of evidence suggests that , surprisingly , much of this organization can arise due to passive competition between actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) [ 29 ] . At the same time , other processes such as the formation of a cytosk - inetic ring require irreversible polymerization and motor activity [ 30 , 31 ] . This suggests that cells can regulate their internal structures and , in turn , functions by tun - ing the relative contributions of passive and active pro - cesses . Support for this idea comes from recent in vitro experiments and simulations that demonstrate that the the morphology of a growing actin bundle can be tuned not only by the binding aﬃnities of the crosslinkers but also by the actin polymerization rates [ 22 ] . These observations , together with recent advances in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics [ 5 , 9 , 17 , 32 – 34 ] , raise the question whether the nonequilibrium driving— here due to polymerization—can be related to the emer - gent structure quantitatively . Here , we address this ques - tion and present a theoretical framework that bounds the dynamics of a growing actin bundle . In particular , we derive constraints on a set of three matrices character - izing the process—a matrix containing the various non - equilibrium driving forces ( δµ , Eq . ( 11 ) ) , a matrix en - coding the equilibrium and nonequilibrium morphologies ( D , Eq . ( 12 ) ) , and a matrix characterizing the covariance of the molecular ﬂuxes ( L − 1 , Section IV ) . For these three matrices , we show that Tr (cid:8) δµ − D − L − 1 (cid:9) ≥ 0 , Det [ δµ − D − L − 1 ] ≥ 0 . ( 1 ) Eq . ( 1 ) has a ﬂavor of the ﬂuctuation dissipation relation . Indeed , when the equality is satisﬁed , Eq . ( 1 ) can be used to obtain a linear - response - like formula connecting the non - equilibrium forcing , the bundle morphology , and the response to ﬂuctuations in molecular ﬂuxes ( Eq . ( 13 ) ) . Eq . ( 1 ) thus provides strong thermodynamic constraints on the non - equilibrium forcing , actin bundle morphology , and speed of growth . Notably , D and L − 1 are experimen - tally accessible , such that Eq . ( 1 ) can be used to bound δµ , which is not straightforward to measure directly . In what follows , we ﬁrst outline a minimal model that captures the salient features of actin polymerization and bundling and show that it captures the observations desribed above . We then proceed to derive our central results , and show how these thermodynamic uncertainty relations constrain the dynamics . II . ACTIN POLYMERIZATION DRIVES SORTING OF ACTIN BUNDLING PROTEINS Inspired by the experiments in Refs . 21 and 22 , we con - sider a bundle consisting of two parallel actin ﬁlaments and two types of ABPs , α and β . The growth of a parallel actin bundle involves continuous actin monomer addition at one end , as well as continual binding and ‘zipping’ of the bundle by ABP binding at that same end . In the spe - ciﬁc case shown in Fig . 1 , α and β represent crosslinking proteins α - actinin and fascin , respectively , such that the bundles formed by the α ABPs are substantially more a r X i v : 2 0 12 . 11588v1 [ c ond - m a t . s o f t ] 2 1 D ec 2020 2 Actin Fascin α - Actinin 35 n m 8 n m 37 nm FIG . 1 . Schematic of adding one ABP at the tip of a growing actin bundle . Here , α and β represent α - actinin and fascin , which are 35 nm and 8 nm in size , respectively . The energetic cost of bending actin disfavors the binding a fascin after an α - actinin , or vice versa , resulting in domains of consecutive α or β types of ABPs . k f , 1 ij and k b , 1 ij ( k f , 2 ij and k b , 2 ij ) are the forward and backward rates for the ﬁrst ( second ) site of an ABP binding , where i and j are the types of the last two ABPs at the tip ; k f , 1 αα = k f , 1 βα because both rates represent the binding of the ﬁrst site of an α ABP . An analogous schematic can be drawn for the case that the second - to - last ABP is α , and this case introduces four additional pairs of forward and backward rates with corresponding constraints . widely spaced than those formed by the β ABPs . Con - sequently , the bending penalty of actin implicitly favors addition of the current crosslinker at the growing end , as it costs energy to switch from one type to the other . Un - der conditions of equilibrium , the cost of bending actin favors the formation of distinct domains of only α or β ABPs . In the case of in vitro experiments using an equimolar mixture of ﬂuorescently labeled α - actinin and fascin binding to growing actin bundles , these domains are on the order of several micrometers ( ∼ 100 crosslink - ers ) long [ 21 ] . As noted above , it has been reported [ 22 ] that the domain length statistics can be modulated by the rate of actin polymerization . We construct a minimal model of this system with the following simpliﬁcations : ﬁrst , we assume that the actin binding proteins can only bind and unbind from the sites at the leading edge and not from the bulk of the actin ﬁlament , and second , we assume that the two binding sites of each ABP bind sequentially and do not allow an ABP to bind to a single ﬁlament with both its sites . As a result , we need two pairs of forward rates k f , 1 ij and backward rates k b , 1 ij to describe the binding of ﬁrst site of each ABP and two other pairs , k f , 2 ij and k b , 2 ij , for their second site ( Fig . 1 ) . The consideration of both heads in - dependently is more sophisticated than the kinetic Monte Carlo ( KMC ) models considered in Refs . 21 and 22 and is consistent with the experimental and simulation obser - vations therein . Here , we further decompose the forward rate of k f , m ij into an equilibrium component , k f , m ij , eq , that satisﬁes a lo - cal detailed balance rule and accounts for all the ener - getics associated with ABP binding and ﬁlament defor - mations , and a component dk f , m ij that can model any non - equilibrium contributions to the rate , k f , m ij = k f , m ij , eq dk f , m ij . ( 2 ) We assert that only the forward rates are modiﬁed by any non - equilibrium eﬀects including actin polymeriza - tion and we set all the k b , m ij to unity . The equilibrium factor k f , m ij , eq accounts for the binding aﬃnity of an ABP . In cases where an attached ABP binds to the second actin ﬁlament , this equilibrium part also accounts for the en - ergy penalty associated with bending the actin ﬁlament if the newly bound ABP is diﬀerent from the previous ABP at the tip ( e . g . , rate k f , 2 βα , eq in Fig . 1 ) and the free en - ergy associated with zipping the actin bundle ( e . g . , rates k f , 2 ββ , eq and k f , 2 βα , eq in Fig . 1 ) . The non - equilibrium component in our model , dk f , m ij , heuristically accounts for any eﬀects due to the ﬁnite rate of actin growth and polymerization , excess concentration or chemical potential of various ABPs in solution , and their molecular structure . Given this , we generically de - compose the non - equilibrium components as dk f , m ij = dk j = 1 + f molecular , j f density , j f pol , j ( 3 ) where i and j are the types of ABPs at the bundle tip . The factor f pol models the modulation of the rates due to the ﬁnite rate of growth of the actin ﬁlaments ( k grow ) . Speciﬁcally , over a time scale τ , the average increase in the number of binding sites on the ﬁlaments is k grow τ and k f , 1 ij , eq τ is the number of binding events per binding site . Assuming Poisson statistics , the net rate of ABP binding is hence modulated by the factor , f pol , i = 1 − e − k f , 1 ii , eq k grow τ 2 ( 4 ) The factor f pol is essentially the probability of binding at least one ABP within time τ . f pol increases from a value of 0 when k grow is negligible to a value of 1 for rapid actin polymerization . It acts as a scaling factor that tunes the rates from their equilibrium values k f , m ij , eq to their maximum rates . The rates of ABP binding are also inﬂuenced by the ABP concentrations in solution around the actin ﬁla - ments . The phenomenological factor f density accounts for these eﬀects . Finally , the phenomenological factor , f molecular has been introduced to account for any remain - ing kinetic diﬀerences between the ABPs . Such factors could modulate the maximum rates of adding ABPs in fast growing bundles , but they do not aﬀect the equilib - rium rates k f , m ij , eq and the corresponding equilibrium struc - ture of the bundle [ 22 ] . KMC simulations of this minimal model ( described in SI Sec . S1 ) reproduce the crossover of domain lengths in fast growing actin bundles ( Fig . 2 ) [ 22 ] . It thus cap - tures the essential physics of the system and serves as a 3 FIG . 2 . Domain length of α and β ABPs as a function of polymerization rate k grow . The distance between neighbor - ing ABPs is assumed to be 0 . 037 µ m in computing domain lengths [ 21 ] . Blue and red triangles are domain lengths L α and L β measured from KMC simulations . Up and down triangles represent the domain lengths measured in simula - tions with initial conﬁgurations composed of either all α or all β types of ABPs , respectively . Gray lines ( Eq . ( S15 ) ) are the domain lengths computed by self - consistently solv - ing the master equation ( Eq . ( 5 ) ) .

The inset shows the domain lengths over a wider range of polymerization rates with the same symbols . The plateaus toward the left of the inset represent the domain lengths approaching their equilibrium values . meaningful starting point for development of a theoreti - cal framework that shows that the behavior is bounded by a general energy - speed - morphology relation . III . CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE GROWTH AND MORPHOLOGY OF ACTIN BUNDLES : A MARKOV STATE MODEL The number of accessible states of the Markov chain for actin polymerization and bundling , as deﬁned in the last section , grows rapidly as a function of time . Writing down thermodynamic relations for such growing systems becomes cumbersome . Here , we show that it is in fact possible to account for the behavior of the growing sys - tem using only a tractable , ﬁnite - state , Markov model . Using this model , we derive thermodynamic bounds for the non - equilibrium sorting process in Fig . 3 . We begin by introducing a mean - ﬁeld treatment for the various conﬁgurations that arise at the tip as ABPs as - sociate and dissociate sequentially ( Fig . 3 ) . The forward N - 1 α β N N - 1 N k f , 1 k b’ , 1 = 1 α α k b ’ , 1 = 1 k f , 1 k f , 1 k b’ , 1 = 1 k f , 1 k b ’ , 1 = 1 α α αβ αβ ββ ββ β α β α k f , 2 αα k b ’ , 2 = ( L α - 1 ) / L α αα k f , 2 α β k b ’ , 2 = 1 / L β α β k f , 2 ββ k b’ , 2 = ββ k b ’ , 2 = 1 / L α k f , 2 β α β α αα ∗ αβ ∗ ββ ∗ βα ∗ ( L β - 1 ) / L β FIG . 3 . Schematic of the N th cross - linker binds to the actin pairs . The states between two pink dashed lines describe the N th ABP binding . Arrows link states between which the transitions are allowed . k f , m ij and k b , m ij are the forward and backward rates , where i and j are the types of the last two ABPs at the tip and ∗ represents a half bound state . The rates used in the KMC simulations and in the master equation are compared in Table S1 . rates k f , m ij are consistent with those used in KMC sim - ulations , accounting for the energetic terms in binding ABPs and the eﬀect of actin polymerization . The back - ward rates in the ﬁnite - state model self - consistently ac - count for the probability of ﬁnding the appropriate ABP in the bulk of the actin bundle . For instance , using L α to denote the domain lengths of α type ABPs and L β for its β counterpart , the probability of ﬁnding an αα ∗ conﬁguration ( where ∗ stands for half bound state as in Fig . 3 ) during unbinding one head of the last α ABP is ( L α − 1 ) / L α and the probability of ﬁnding a βα ∗ conﬁg - uration is 1 / L α . In computing the unbinding rate k b (cid:48) , m ij used in the ﬁnite - state model , we multiply the backward rates k b , m ij in KMC simulations by the corresponding con - ditional probabilities . Note that the eﬀective backward rate for unbinding the ﬁrst head of an ABP , k b (cid:48) , 1 ij , is equal to k b , 1 ij in KMC simulations because the conditional prob - abilities in these transitions are 1 . The diﬀerence in k b (cid:48) , 1 ij and k b (cid:48) , 2 ij is because the unbinding of an ABP’s ﬁrst site k b (cid:48) , 1 ij initiates from state ij ∗ and reaches state i , so the type of the preceding ABP is known from the current state , while the unbinding of ABP’s second site k b (cid:48) , 2 ij ini - tiates from state j and the type of the preceding ABP i is uncertain ( see Fig . 3 ) . We conﬁrm the expressions of these conditional probabilities by extracting the eﬀective backward rates and domain length ratios from the full KMC simulations ( Fig . S1 ) . Given these expressions for the rates , we can write a master equation describing the evolution of probabilities 4 of the various tip conﬁgurations , P ij : WP = (cid:88) i , j = α , β ( k f , 1 ij P i − k b (cid:48) , 1 ij P ij ∗ + k f , 2 ij P ij ∗ − k b (cid:48) , 2 ij P j ) = 0 . ( 5 ) However , this master equation depends on the average domain length L α and L β . To solve the master equa - tion of this system and get closed form expressions of P ij at the steady state , we require a relation that connects the tip conﬁguration probabilities to the domain lengths . Such a connection can be obtained by noting that as the bundle barbed end grows , the tip conﬁguration merges into the bulk of the bundle . The probabilities of tip conﬁgurations at steady state together with their corre - sponding rates determine the relative amounts of the two types of ABPs growing into the bulk . In other words , the ﬂuxes J N − 1 , i , N , j = k f , 1 ij P i − k b (cid:48) , 1 ij P ij ∗ = k f , 2 ij P ij ∗ − k b (cid:48) , 2 ij P j are proportional to the probabilities of sampling the cor - responding ABPs in the bulk ( see Eq . ( S13 ) ) . Indeed , this reasoning can be put on a ﬁrm mathe - matical footing by adapting the calculations in Ref . 35 . Speciﬁcally , as described in SI Section S2 , we derive self - consistency conditions that relate the currents at which various tip conﬁgurations grow to the domain lengths in bulk : J N − 1 , α , N , α = L α − 1 L tot J tot J N − 1 , β , N , β = L β − 1 L tot J tot J N − 1 , α , N , β = J N − 1 , β , N , α = 1 L tot J tot ( 6 ) where N − 1 , i , N , j denotes the tip conﬁgurations at posi - tion N − 1 and N , J tot is the sum of the four currents , and L tot ≡ L α + L β . We measure the currents and domain lengths from KMC simulations , and Fig . S2 demonstrates the validity of the relations between the ﬂuxes and do - main lengths in Eq . ( 6 ) . The master equation ( Eq . ( 5 ) ) can now be solved with these additional self - consistency conditions . Expressions for the non - equilibrium domain lengths L α and L β can also be readily obtained ( Eq . ( S15 ) ) . The gray lines in Fig . 2 illustrate that these predictions are in excel - lent agreement with the domain lengths in KMC simu - lations for the full range of actin polymerization rates . This model also recovers the trend shown previously by simulations [ 22 ] that as the binding aﬃnity of the short crosslinker ( equivalent to β ABP in our model ) is weak - ened , the crossover of domain lengths is deferred to a faster growth speed . Thus our mean - ﬁeld treatment is able to capture the behavior of the model quantitatively . IV . THERMODYNAMIC CONSTRAINTS BETWEEN THE NON - EQUILIBRIUM FORCING , FLUCTUATIONS , AND MORPHOLOGY The non - equilibrium thermodynamics of the growing actin bundle can now be probed . Using the master equa - tion ( Eq . ( 5 ) ) and the ﬁnite - state Markov model in Fig . 3 , the entropy production rate ˙ σ for our eﬀective Markov model can be written as ˙ σ = J tot ( ∆ µ − ε diss ) (cid:62) 0 . ( 7 ) The factor ∆ µ represents the non - equilibrium forces driv - ing polymerization ; it is deﬁned as ∆ µ = 2 L tot (cid:32) α , β (cid:88) i L i log dk i (cid:33) . ( 8 ) The factor ε diss is a measure of the diﬀerence between the non - equilibrium and equilibrium morphologies as charecterized by the respective average domain lengths L β , eq and L α , eq . ε diss = − 1 L tot (cid:18) α , β (cid:88) i L i log L i L i , eq − α , β (cid:88) i ( L i − 1 ) log L i − 1 L i , eq − 1 (cid:19) . ( 9 ) Eq . ( 7 ) is a statement of the second law of thermodynam - ics . However , we can improve on this bound substantially by adapting recent work [ 36 , 37 ] . Speciﬁcally , we show in the SI Section . S3 that a stronger matrix relation can be obtained that is valid far from equilibrium . This is our main result , Eq . ( 1 ) , which we reproduce here for convenience : Tr (cid:8) δµ − D − L − 1 (cid:9) ≥ 0 , Det [ δµ − D − L − 1 ] ≥ 0 . ( 10 ) We now deﬁne the matrices δµ , D and L − 1 precisely . The matrix δµ depends on the non - equilibrium driving forces δµ α / β ≡ log dk α / β in Eq . ( 3 ) and the average non - equilibrium domain lengths L α / β : δµ = (cid:18) δµ α γ α 1 + δµ β γ β 2 δµ α γ α 3 + δµ β γ β 3 δµ α γ α 3 + δµ β γ β 3 δµ α γ α 2 + δµ β γ β 1 (cid:19) ( 11 ) where γ α / β 1 ≡ [ ( L tot − 1 ) 2 / ( L α / β − 1 ) + 1 ] / L tot , γ α / β 2 ≡ [ 1 / ( L α / β − 1 ) + 1 ] / L tot , and γ α / β 3 ≡ − L β / α / [ L tot ( L α / β − 1 ) ] . The matrix D depends on the non - equilibrium and equilibrium domain lengths of ABPs and is deﬁned as D = (cid:18) dp α γ α 1 + dp β γ β 2 + (cid:15) dp α γ α 3 + dp β γ β 3 + (cid:15) dp α γ α 3 + dp β γ β 3 + (cid:15) dp α γ α 2 + dp β γ β 1 + (cid:15) (cid:19) ( 12 ) where dp α / β ≡ ( 1 / 2 ) ( ln [ ( L α / β − 1 ) / L α / β ] − ln [ ( L eq α / β − 1 ) / L eq α / β ] ) and (cid:15) ≡ ( 1 / ( 2 L tot ) ) ( ln [ ( L eq α − 1 ) / ( L α − 1 ) ] + 5 ln [ ( L eq β − 1 ) / ( L β − 1 ) ] ) . The D matrix only depends on the equilibrium and non - equilibrium morphologies of the bundle . L − 1 is proportional to the inverse of the covariance matrix of ﬂuxes and is computed as L − 1 ≡ lim t →∞ J tot M − 1 / t , in which M has the elements M ij = (cid:104) δJ i δJ j (cid:105) and t is the time of growth . In Fig . 4 , we numerically verify Eq . ( 1 ) / Eq . ( 10 ) for various parameter combinations . The equality in Eq . ( 10 ) holds only when δµ − D = L − 1 . In that case multiplying Eq . 1 by the column vector J , containing the the average ﬂuxes J α / β computed using Eq . ( 6 ) as J α / β = J N − 1 , α , N , α / β + J N − 1 , β , N , α / β ( detailed in SI Section . S4 ) , we readily obtain dk − D [ p ] = ˜ L − 1 · J ( 13 ) where ˜ L − 1 ≡ L − 1 / J tot , dk is a column vector with ele - ments log dk α / β ( Eq . ( 3 ) ) , and D [ p ] is a column vector with elements that are the relative entropies between the equilibrium and non - equilibrium domain morphologies of the two crosslinkers in the bundle ( Eqs . ( S32 ) and ( S33 ) ) . Eq . ( 13 ) can be viewed as an extension of the ﬂuctua - tion dissipation relation to our non - equilibrium bundling and polymerization process . It relates the various driving forces dk and a relative entropic measure of the distance between the non - equilibrium and equilibrium structures , D [ p ] , to the various observed ﬂuxes J through the ﬂux covariance matrix ˜ L − 1 . The so called thermodynamic uncertainty relations ( TUR ) [ 33 , 34 , 36 – 38 ] can also be readily derived from Eq . ( 10 ) . Speciﬁcally , Eq . ( 10 ) implies that ˜ J T · [ δµ − D − L − 1 ] · ˜ J ≥ 0 for any vector ˜ J . Hence , the so called multidimensional thermodynamic relation ( MTUR ) [ 37 ] can be derived ( SI Section S5 ) : J tot ( ∆ µ − ε diss ) = 2 J (cid:124) · ( dk − D [ p ] ) (cid:62) 2 J (cid:124) · ˜L − 1 J . ( 14 ) Our central result provides a connection between the microscopic driving forces represented by δµ or dk , the non - equilibrium structure of the bundle as encoded by matrix D or D [ p ] , and the ﬂuctuations of the various ﬂuxes denoted by L − 1 ( obtained in the non - equilibrium steady state ) . Experimentally , it is possible to measure the ﬂuxes of various bundling proteins , and the struc - ture of the bundles . Then , one can use Eq . ( 1 ) to bound the microscopic driving forces . These microscopic forces generally cannot be measured directly . Further , in non - equilibrium regimes where the L − 1 matrix exhibits sin - gular or close to singular behavior , our results suggest that the system might be insensitive to perturbations that tune the various microscopic driving forces , dk . Our results suggest that the non - equilibrium bundling mor - phology can be eﬀectively tuned away from such points . Finally , Eq . ( 1 ) / Eq . ( 10 ) can also be used to assess the relative importance of accounting for the statistics of the individual ﬂuxes . To do so , we use the thermodynamic uncertainty relations to derive a bound for the rate of FIG . 4 . Numerical veriﬁcation of Eq . ( 10 ) . The blue bound - ary marks the location of the inequality Tr [ M ] ≥ 2 (cid:112) Det [ M ] for a two dimensional square matrix M . The red diamonds are results from the non - equilibrium KMC simulations with the parameters used in Fig . 2 and the red line is the theoret - ical mean ﬁeld prediction for those same parameters . Gray dots are computed by constructing the matrices δµ , D , and L − 1 using the the master equation results and computing the eigenvalues of ( δµ − D − L − 1 ) / J tot using Mathematica [ 39 ] for randomly selected parameters from L β , eq = [ 1 , 90000 ] , f density , β = [ 1 , 100 ] and k grow = [ 0 . 001 , 100 ] nm / s , with all other parameters the same as the red line . The inset shows these two quantities for a wider range , with both axes in log - arithmic scale . We do not consider k grow < 0 . 001 nm / s due to limitations of numerical precision . Eq . ( 1 ) / Eq . ( 10 ) pro - vides strong constraints between the non - equilibrium forcing , morphology , and speed of growth . entropy production in terms of the total ﬂux , J tot : ∆ µ (cid:62) ε diss + 2 (cid:104) J tot (cid:105) t (cid:104) δJ 2tot (cid:105) . ( 15 ) Here , t is the growth time of the bundle , (cid:104) J tot (cid:105) is the average total ﬂux of adding ABPs to the bundle , and (cid:10) δJ 2tot (cid:11) is its variance . In Fig . 5 , we compare the perfor - mance of Eq . ( 15 ) ( brown ) with that of Eq . ( 7 ) ( blue ) . We see that the TUR bound is closer to the real driving ∆ µ compared with the second - law bound . Nevertheless , it still fails signiﬁcantly at k grow ≈ 1 nm / s , where it only recovers about 6 % of the actual driving . This implies that controlling the overall kinetics is not enough for fa - cilitating the sorting of ABPs . In Fig . 5 , we also plot the MTUR bound ( Eq . ( 14 ) ) us - ing cumulants of ﬂuctuations in the individual ﬂuxes from KMC simulations . Although not perfect , this bound re - covers at least 46 % of the actual driving ∆ µ for the full range of polymerization rates . The increasing gap be - tween the MTUR bound and the actual driving is consis - tent with our central result in Fig . 4 that Tr [ δµ − D − L − 1 ] becomes further away from zero as microscopic driving 6 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 10 100 k grow ( nm / s ) 0 . 0001 0 . 001 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 10 ∆ µ actual ∆ µ ∆ µ allowed by MTUR ∆ µ allowed by ε diss ∆ µ allowed by TUR FIG . 5 .

( 7 ) ) is the driving force required for morphology change . The brown ( Eq . ( 15 ) ) and red ( Eq . ( 14 ) ) lines are the thermody - namic bounds computed from KMC simulations using TUR and MTUR . Each of the brown and red data points is gen - erated with 500 independent KMC simulations , each of 10 7 steps . All parameters of the KMC simulations are the same as in Fig . 2 . becomes stronger and makes growth faster . The MTUR bound in Eq . ( 14 ) is equivalent to consid - ering a scalar observable J φ = cos φJ α + sin φJ β and then maximizing 2 (cid:104) J φ (cid:105) 2 / ( tJ tot (cid:68) δJ 2 φ (cid:69) ) by varying φ ( SI Sec - tion S5 ) . When tan φ = 1 , we recover the TUR bound in Eq . ( 15 ) . Compared with this TUR bound , we ﬁnd that the MTUR bound is mostly improved where the opti - mized tan φ values deviate signiﬁcantly from 1 ( Fig . S4 ) , and the ﬂuxes are strongly correlated . Hence it is cru - cial to take into consideration the statistics of the indi - vidual ﬂuxes . Indeed , the analytical expression of tan φ ( Eq . ( S41 ) ) and the empirical results in Fig . S5 and Fig . S6 show that tan φ is mainly governed by the ratio of the domain lengths , L α / L β . In the regime k grow ≈ 0 . 1 to 10 nm / s , the domain lengths of the two ABPs diﬀer signiﬁcantly . We conclude that thermodynamic costs can be seriously masked if only the total ﬂux instead of indi - vidual ones are resolved in regimes where the two ABPs display remarkably diﬀerent sorting behavior . V . CONCLUSIONS In conclusion , we have derived a strong thermody - namic constraint relating the microscopic driving of a growing bundle ( denoted by δµ in Eq . ( 1 ) ) , the mor - phology of the bundle in its non - equilibrium steady state as described by the matrix D , and the statistics of the rates of incorporation of crosslinkers as described by the matrix L − 1 . Our central results , which can be viewed as extensions of the ﬂuctuation dissipation relations , also have practical applications . As an example , they po - tentially provide a route to estimate microscopic driving forces ( contained in the δµ matrix ) from experiments in which the various ﬂuxes and morphologies are measured using microscopy and quantitative image analysis While this current work is focused exclusively on the growth dynamics of bundled actin networks , we antic - ipate that the formalism presented here can be used in other contexts , such as the interplay between struc - ture , speed , and non - equilibrium forcing in the growth dynamics of branched actin networks [ 40 – 42 ] , the self - organization of other ABPs to distinct actin network architectures ( e . g . networks initiated by formin or the Arp2 / 3 complex ) [ 29 ] , and the sorting of ABPs to dis - tinct networks under conﬁnement [ 23 ] .

S1 SUPPORTING INFORMATION S1 . KINETIC MONTE CARLO ( KMC ) SIMULATIONS We simulate the growth of an actin bundle with two types of ABPs using KMC simulations . Two initial conﬁg - urations are selected for each simulation : an actin bundle composed of 100 α type ABPs or a bundle composed of 100 β type ABPs . We exclude this ﬁrst 100 ABPs when measuring the ﬁnal structure and ﬁnd that domain lengths in the bundle are independent of its initial conﬁguration in the parameter range we explore . For each step in the KMC simulations , we ﬁrst identify which state the bundle tip is at , and all the possible forward and backward moves that can be initiated from this state . The KMC simulations are performed using the Gillespie algorithm [ 43 ] . We summarize the rates used in the KMC simulations in Table S1 . To compute domain lengths in Fig . 2 , we run one simulation of S = 10 6 steps at each k grow and measure domain lengths L α and L β from the full bundle by counting the number of consecutive ABPs of the same type and averaging their lengths . To generate the KMC data points in Fig . 4 and Fig . 5 , we run 500 simulations of S = 10 6 steps at each actin polymerization rate k grow > 0 . 01 nm / s ; at k grow = 0 . 01 nm / s , we run 5000 simulations of S = 2 × 10 8 steps to ensure the convergence of the covariance of the ﬂuxes . S2 . MEAN FIELD MASTER EQUATION A . The backward rates in the master equation account for conditional probabilities during unbinding We summarize the rates used in the master equation in Table S1 . While in the KMC simulations the backward rates are unity , in the master equation they include the conditional probabilities of ﬁnding the appropriate type of ABP during unbinding . We thus express them in terms of the domain lengths in the bulk . To validate these expressions , we compute the eﬀective backward rates in KMC simulations by counting the number of occurrences of each unbinding case . Fig . S1 demonstrates that the expressions are quantitatively accurate . TABLE S1 .

Domain lengths and rates at equilibrium Given the rates in Table S1 , we can solve the master equation ( Eq . ( 5 ) ) at equilibrium to obtain constraints on the equilibrium rates . At equilibrium , all currents are zero , which results in the following relations between the equilibrium rates and equilibrium domain lengths , L α , eq and L β , eq .

Validation of the backward rate expressions used in the master equation . Domain lengths ratio ( L α − 1 ) / L α and ( L β − 1 / L β ( blue and red circles ) are computed from full bundle conﬁgurations in KMC simulations . The eﬀective backward rates k b (cid:48) , 2 αα ( cyan ) and k b (cid:48) , 2 ββ ( black ) in KMC simulations are computed as k b (cid:48) , 2 αα = N b , 2 αα / N b , 2 αα + N b , 2 βα and k b (cid:48) , 2 ββ = N b , 2 ββ / N b , 2 αβ + N b , 2 ββ . N b , 2 ij is the number of occurrences of unbinding the second head of an ABP , where i and j are the types of the last two ABPs at the tip . k f , 1 αα , eq k f , 2 αα , eq = L α , eq − 1 L α , eq k f , 1 ββ , eq k f , 2 ββ , eq = L β , eq − 1 L β , eq k f , 1 αβ , eq k f , 2 αβ , eq k f , 1 βα , eq k f , 2 βα , eq = 1 L α , eq L β , eq ( S1 ) Since the rate of binding of the ﬁrst site does not depend on the ﬁlament separation , k f , 1 αα , eq = k f , 1 βα , eq and k f , 1 ββ , eq = k f , 1 αβ , eq . Consequently , there are six independent forward rates at equilibrium . We use the constraints above but split the third equation in Eq . ( S1 ) into the relations : k f , 1 αβ , eq k f , 2 αβ , eq = L β , eq − 1 L β , eq ( L α , eq − 1 ) k f , 1 βα , eq k f , 2 βα , eq = L α , eq − 1 L α , eq ( L β , eq − 1 ) . ( S2 ) An interpretation of Eq . ( S2 ) is that the eﬀective bending penalty in switching from α to β is k f , 2 αβ , eq / k f , 2 ββ , eq = 1 / ( L α , eq − 1 ) , and the bending penalty in switching from β to α is k f , 2 βα , eq / k f , 2 αα , eq = 1 / ( L β , eq − 1 ) . We use these constraints on equilibrium rates to simplify the expression for the entropy production ( see SI Section 4 ) . Using Eq . ( S1 ) and Eq . ( S2 ) , we are able to represent the equilibrium condition with four parameters , L α , eq , L β , eq , k f , 1 αα , eq , and k f , 1 ββ , eq . C . Derivation of the self - consistency conditions Under non - equilibrium conditions , the currents are non - zero . We need an additional constraint on the domain lengths to solve the master equation for L α and L β . For this purpose , we derive the following self - consistency S3 conditions , which are inspired by Ref . 35 . We consider a chain of ABPs with the sequence of ω l ω l − 1 . . . ω 0 , where ω i represents the type of ABP at position i , and the crosslinker at the tip is index i = 0 . We write down an equation for the probability of ﬁnding this sequence at time t , P t ( ω l ω l − 1 . . . ω 0 ) : ∂P t ( ω l ω l − 1 . . . ω 0 ) ∂t = w + ω 0 | ω 1 P t ( ω l ω l − 1 . . . ω 1 ) + (cid:88) Z w − Z | ω 0 P t ( ω l | ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 ) P t ( ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 | ω l − 2 ω l − 1 . . . ω 0 ω Z ) P t ( ω l − 2 ω l − 1 . . . ω 0 ω Z ) − ( w − ω 0 | ω 1 + (cid:88) Z w + Z | ω 0 ) P t ( ω l | ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 ) P t ( ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 ) , ( S3 ) where w + ω i | ω j is the rate of addition of ω i to ω j and w − ω i | ω j is the rate of removal of ω i to expose ω j at the tip . In what follows , we solve Eq . ( S3 ) at steady state : ∂P t ( ω l ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 ) ∂t = 0 . ( S4 ) We ﬁrst substitute Eq . ( S3 ) into Eq . ( S4 ) and rearrange to express the possibility of having ω l in addition to the sequence ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 . P t ( ω l | ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 ) = w + ω 0 | ω 1 P t ( ω l ω l − 1 . . . ω 1 ) ( w − ω 0 | ω 1 + v ω 0 ) P t ( ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 ) v ω 0 ≡ (cid:80) Z w + Z | ω 0 P t ( ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 ) − (cid:80) Z w − Z | ω 0 P t ( ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 ω Z ) P t ( ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 ) ( S5 ) Physically , v ω 0 is the growing rate at the tip with crosslinker type ω 0 . By further rearranging Eq . ( S5 ) and summing over ω 0 , we obtain the following expression . (cid:88) ω 0 w + ω 0 | ω 1 P t ( ω l ω l − 1 . . . ω 1 ) − (cid:88) ω 0 w − ω 0 | ω 1 P t ( ω l ω l − 1 . . . ω 0 ) = (cid:88) ω 0 v ω 0 P t ( ω l | ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 ) P t ( ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 ) ( S6 ) The left side of Eq . ( S6 ) is v ω 1 P t ( ω l ω l − 1 . . . ω 1 ) , so Eq . ( S6 ) becomes v ω 1 P t ( ω l ω l − 1 . . . ω 1 ) = (cid:88) ω 0 v ω 0 P t ( ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 ) P t ( ω l | ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 ) ( S7 ) Eq . ( S7 ) is equivalent to Eq . 34 in ref . [ 35 ] . We use Γ 0 to represent the conﬁguration ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 and Γ 1 to represent the conﬁguration ω l ω l − 2 . . . ω 1 . Imagining that we focus on the conﬁguration with a ﬁxed length l from the tip of the chain ω 0 and moving backwards one position each time , Eq . ( S7 ) provides a connection between the probability of ﬁnding Γ 1 and the probability of ﬁnding Γ 0 . We can write Eq . ( S7 ) in matrix form as P t ( Γ 1 ) = W ( Γ 1 | Γ 0 ) P t ( Γ 0 ) ( S8 ) where W ( Γ 1 | Γ 0 ) = P t ( ω l | ω l − 1 ω l − 2 . . . ω 0 ) for consistent sequences Γ 0 and Γ 1 . Consequently , applying W N times , we have P t ( Γ N ) = W N P t ( Γ 0 ) . ( S9 ) At steady state , the eigenvector of W with eigenvalue 1 is the probability ¯ P ( Γ ) of ﬁnding a particular sequence Γ in the bulk . From Eq . ( S7 ) we can now immediately see that ¯ P ( Γ ∞ ) = v tip ( Γ ∞ ) ¯ v P t ( Γ ∞ ) , ( S10 ) where Γ ∞ denotes a sequence in the bulk , ¯ v is the total growth rate at the tip for all conﬁgurations , and v tip ( Γ i ) = v ω i . In what follows , we use Eq . ( S10 ) to derive the self - consistency conditions speciﬁc to our system . We choose two neighboring ABPs ω m ω m − 1 for the conﬁguration size , where m ranges from 1 to l . There are four conﬁgurations : ω m , α , ω m − 1 , α , ω m , β , ω m − 1 , α , ω m , α , ω m − 1 , β , and ω m , β , ω m − 1 , β . We refer to the term on the right hand side of Eq . ( S10 ) as currents in the main text . S4 v tip ( ω m , α , ω m − 1 , α ) P t ( ω m , α , ω m − 1 , α ) ≡ J ω m , α , ω m − 1 , α = k f , 1 αα P ( α ) − k b , 1 αα P ( αα ∗ ) = k f , 2 αα P ( αα ∗ ) − k b , 2 αα P ( α ) v tip ( ω m , β , ω m − 1 , β ) P t ( ω m , β , ω m − 1 , β ) ≡ J ω m , β , ω m − 1 , β = k f , 1 ββ P ( β ) − k b , 1 ββ P ( ββ ∗ ) = k f , 2 ββ P ( ββ ∗ ) − k b , 2 ββ P ( β ) v tip ( ω m , α , ω m − 1 , β ) P t ( ω m , α , ω m − 1 , β ) ≡ J ω m , α , ω m − 1 , β = k f , 1 αβ P ( α ) − k b , 1 αβ P ( αβ ∗ ) = k f , 2 αβ P ( αβ ∗ ) − k b , 2 αβ P ( β ) v tip ( ω m , β , ω m − 1 , α ) P t ( ω m , β , ω m − 1 , α ) ≡ J ω m , β , ω m − 1 , α = k f , 1 βα P ( β ) − k b , 1 βα P ( βα ∗ ) = k f , 2 βα P ( βα ∗ ) − k b , 2 βα P ( α ) ( S11 ) where J ω m , i , ω m − 1 , j is the current of ABPs of type j binding after ABPs of type i . J tot is the sum of the four currents : ¯ v ≡ J tot = J ω m − 1 , α , ω m , α + J ω m − 1 , α , ω m , β + J ω m − 1 , β , ω m , β + J ω m − 1 , β , ω m , α . ( S12 ) By combining Eq . ( S10 ) and Eq . ( S11 ) , we can obtain the following self - consistency condition , J ω m − 1 , α , ω m , α = ¯ P t ( ω m , α , ω m − 1 , α ) J tot J ω m − 1 , β , ω m , β = ¯ P t ( ω m , β , ω m − 1 , β ) J tot J ω m − 1 , α , ω m , β = J ω m − 1 , β , ω m , α = ¯ P t ( ω m , α , ω m − 1 , β ) J tot . ( S13 ) The current J ω m − 1 , α , ω m , β is identical to the current J ω m − 1 , β , ω m , α because for every switch of a domain of α crosslink - ers there is a switch to a domain of β crosslinkers . ¯ P t ( ω m , ω m − 1 ) is the probability of ﬁnding a speciﬁc conﬁguration ω m ω m − 1 in the bulk ; it can be expressed in terms of the domain lengths as follows . ¯ P t ( ω m , α , ω m − 1 , α ) = L α − 1 L α + L β ¯ P t ( ω m , β , ω m − 1 , β ) = L β − 1 L + L β ¯ P t ( ω m , α , ω m − 1 , β ) = ¯ P t ( ω m , β , ω m − 1 , α ) = 1 L α + L β ( S14 ) Using Eq . ( S13 ) and Eq . ( S14 ) , we obtain Eq . ( 6 ) . Note that in main text we omit the ω ’s in the subscripts of the currents for clarity . The self - consistency conditions are validated by KMC simulations ( Fig . S2 ) . D . Domain lengths predicted by master equation Since the equilibrium parameters and the driving parts of the rates are determined , we now use the self - consistency condition above to solve the master equation ( Eq . ( 5 ) ) for the domain lengths L α and L β under non - equilibrium conditions . L β = ( L α − 1 ) k f , 2 βα − k f , 2 αα ( L α ( k f , 2 βα + 1 ) k f , 1 αα + L α − 1 ) k f , 2 βα k f , 1 αα ( Lk f , 2 αα ( ( 1 + k f , 2 αβ ) k f , 1 αα − ( L α − 1 ) k f , 2 αβ k f , 1 ββ ) − ( L α − 1 ) ( 1 + k f , 2 αβ + Lk f , 2 αβ k f , 1 ββ ) ) L α = ( L β − 1 ) k f , 2 αβ − k f , 2 ββ ( L β ( k f , 2 αβ + 1 ) k f , 1 ββ + L β − 1 ) k f , 2 αβ k f , 1 ββ ( Sk f , 2 ββ ( ( 1 + k f , 2 βα ) k f , 1 ββ − ( L β − 1 ) k f , 2 βα k f , 1 αα ) − ( L β − 1 ) ( 1 + k f , 2 βα + Sk f , 2 βα k f , 1 αα ) ) ( S15 ) We compute the domain lengths from Eq . ( S15 ) numerically and compare them with those measured from KMC simulations in Fig . 2 . We solve Eq . ( S15 ) using standard numerical routines in MATHEMATICA . The quality of the numerical solutions depends on the eﬀectiveness of our mean ﬁeld approach . In general , we ﬁnd that the mean ﬁeld approximations behind Eq . ( S15 ) works well far from equilibrium but perform poorly close to equilibrium . S3 . DERIVATION OF EQ . ( 1 ) In this section , we derive Eq . ( 1 ) of the main text . Our derivation closely follows those in Refs . 34 and 36 . As in the main text , we focus of experimentally accessible currents J α and J β related to the net rate at which the diﬀerent S5 0 . 001 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 10 100 k grow ( nm / s ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 R a t i o s ( L α - 1 ) / ( L α + L β ) N - 1 , α , N , α J J / J tot N - 1 , β , N , β / J tot ( L β - 1 ) / ( L α + L β ) FIG . S2 . Comparison of currents and domain length ratios from KMC simulations at various actin polymerization rates . Both currents and domain lengths are measured from KMC simulations of 10 6 steps . The simulation parameters are the same as those used in generating Fig . 2 . crosslinkers are assimilated into the bundle . In particular , using the notation in Fig . S3 , we have J α = [ j ( 1 ) + j ( 4 ) + j ( 5 ) + j ( 8 ) ] / 2 J β = [ j ( 2 ) + j ( 3 ) + j ( 6 ) + j ( 7 ) ] / 2 , ( S16 ) where we use j ( (cid:15) ) to denote the current along the edge (cid:15) . Eq . ( S16 ) can be written in matrix form as J ( n ) = (cid:88) (cid:15) j ( (cid:15) ) d ( (cid:15) , n ) ( S17 ) where d ( n , (cid:15) ) are elements in a matrix d that describes how each of the generalized currents depends on the edge currents . For the speciﬁc case described above in Eq . ( S16 ) , the d matrix can be written as : d T = 1 2 (cid:18) 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 (cid:19) ( S18 ) Before proceeding further , we outline the structure of the proof . We attempt to derive Eq . ( 1 ) by deriving constraints on the ﬂuctuations of J α and J β ( or equivalently J ( n ) in Eq . ( S17 ) ) . To do so we ﬁrst express J ( n ) in terms of the edge currents ˜ j ( (cid:15) ) such that ˜ j ( (cid:15) ) are guaranteed to satisfy current conservation , and they satisfy J ( n ) = (cid:80) (cid:15) ˜ j ( (cid:15) ) d ( (cid:15) , n ) . Then , we use the ﬁndings of Ref . 34 which showed that the large deviation rate functions associated with the ﬂuctuations in the various edge currents satisfy the following inequality , I ( j ) ≤ (cid:88) (cid:15) ( j ( (cid:15) ) − j π ( (cid:15) ) ) 2 σ π ( (cid:15) ) 4 [ j ( (cid:15) ) ] 2 , ( S19 ) where I ( j ) is the rate function of the edge currents and σ π ( (cid:15) ) is the entropy production of edge (cid:15) . Finally , by writing Eq . ( S19 ) in terms of the generalized currents J ( n ) , we obtain our central result . We now proceed by ﬁrst “inverting” Eq . ( S17 ) and deﬁning a set of edge currents : ˜ j ( (cid:15) ) = (cid:88) n J ( n ) G ( n , (cid:15) ) ( S20 ) where G is a pseudoinverse of the matrix d . Note that since G and d are pseudoinverses of one another , we have (cid:88) (cid:15) ˜ j ( (cid:15) ) d ( (cid:15) , k ) = (cid:88) n , (cid:15) J ( n ) G ( n , (cid:15) ) d ( (cid:15) , k ) = (cid:88) n , (cid:15) , (cid:15) (cid:48) j ( (cid:15) (cid:48) ) d ( (cid:15) (cid:48) , n ) G ( n , (cid:15) ) d ( (cid:15) , k ) = (cid:88) (cid:15) (cid:48) j ( (cid:15) (cid:48) ) d ( (cid:15) (cid:48) , k ) = J ( k ) ( S21 ) S6 If the set of currents ˜ j satisfy current conservation – we will construct a matrix G below in Eq . S29 that satisﬁes this constraint – we can use the arguments in Ref . 34 and 36 to substitute Eq . ( S20 ) into Eq . ( S19 ) and obtain a bound on the large deviation rate function associated with the generalized currents , I ( J ) I ( J ) ≤ (cid:88) (cid:15) (cid:32)(cid:88) n J ( n ) G ( n , (cid:15) ) − J π ( (cid:15) ) G ( n , (cid:15) ) (cid:33) 2 σ π ( (cid:15) ) 4 [ j ( (cid:15) ) ] 2 . ( S22 ) Now let’s consider the system at steady state , with J π denoting the vector of average generalized currents and L denoting the covariance of generalized currents . The rate function I ( J ) can be expanded around the average generalized currents , J π , as I ( J ) ≈ I ( J π ) + D [ I ( J ) | J π ] · ˜J + 1 2 ˜J T · H [ I ( J ) | J π ] · ˜J ( S23 ) Here ˜J is a vector with elements ( J ( n ) − J π ( n ) ) , and D [ I ( J ) | J π ] is the vector containing the derivatives of the rate function I ( J ) with respect to the current J . Since the rate function is at its minimum at J π , I ( J π ) and D [ I ( J ) | J π ] equal to 0 . H [ I ( J ) | J π ] is the Hessian matrix of I ( J ) evaluated at J π which can be related to the covariance matrix L by [ 44 ] H [ I ( J ) | J π ] = L − 1 . ( S24 ) Eq . ( S23 ) and Eq . ( S24 ) then allow us to rewrite Eq . ( S22 ) as ˜J T · L − 1 · ˜J ≤ ˜J T · GSG · ˜J ( S25 ) Here G is the matrix form of G ( n , (cid:15) ) with n indicating the row and (cid:15) indicating the column , G T is its transpose and S is a diagonal matrix with elements σ ( (cid:15) ) / 2 | j ( (cid:15) ) | 2 . Since Eq . ( S22 ) is valid for any arbitrary ﬂuctuation about the mean , GSG T − L − 1 has to be positive semi - deﬁnite , which is to say that all of its eigenvalues have to be non - negative . For a 2 × 2 matrix , this is equivalent to Tr ( GSG T − L − 1 ) ≥ 0 , Det ( GSG T − L − 1 ) ≥ 0 . ( S26 ) To ﬁnish the proof , we now need to ﬁx a matrix G . The choice of G is guided by the fact that the inequality in Eq . ( S22 ) is only valid when the currents ˜ j are conserved currents , which means the sum of the currents that go through each node is zero . This gives the following constraints on the edge currents ˜ j i ( with the notation as speciﬁed in Fig . S3 ) . ˜ j ( 1 ) = ˜ j ( 5 ) , ˜ j ( 3 ) = ˜ j ( 7 ) , ˜ j ( 2 ) = ˜ j ( 4 ) = ˜ j ( 6 ) = ˜ j ( 8 ) ( S27 ) These constraints require that the elements in G have the following relations . G ( i , 1 ) = G ( i , 5 ) , G ( i , 3 ) = G ( i , 7 ) , G ( i , 2 ) = G ( i , 4 ) = G ( i , 6 ) = G ( i , 8 ) ( S28 ) where i = 1 or 2 are the ﬁrst and second row of G and represent the contributions of α and β components of the generalized currents to each edge currents . The following G matrix written in terms of L α and L β satisﬁes all the constraints and is also a psuedoinverse of the d matrix : G = 1 ( L α + L β ) (cid:18) L α + L β − 1 1 − 1 1 L α + L β − 1 1 − 1 1 − 1 1 L α + L β − 1 1 − 1 1 L α + L β − 1 1 (cid:19) ( S29 ) Substituting the above equation into GSG T and collecting the terms with ln dk α / β gives us the matrix δµ in the main text . The rest is the matrix D in main text . S4 . DERIVATION OF THE LINEAR RESPONSE LIKE IDENTITY A ﬂuctuation dissipation like form can also be obtained as in Eq . ( 13 ) of the main text . In this section , we derive Eq . ( 13 ) using the matrix GSG T we determined in Section S3 . First , we multiply the matrix GSG T by the vector J on both sides : J T GSG T J = j T Sj = ˙ σ / 2 ( S30 ) S7 N - 1 α β N N - 1 N αα ∗ αβ ∗ ββ ∗ βα ∗ ( 1 ) ( 5 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) FIG . S3 . Schematic showing all the possible transitions of the actin bundle system . We index the graph edges from 1 to 8 . With J T = ( J α , J β ) and j T = ( j 1 , j 2 , . . . , j 8 ) The entropy production can be further rewritten as : ˙ σ = J tot ( ∆ µ − ε diss ) = 2 J T ( dk − D [ p ] ) ( S31 ) where the microscopic force vector dk and the relative entropy term D [ p ] are deﬁned as dk = (cid:18) log dk α log dk β (cid:19) D [ p ] = (cid:18) D ( P ( α ) | | P eq ( α ) ) D ( P ( β ) | | P eq ( β ) ) (cid:19) ( S32 ) with D ( P ( i ) | | P eq ( i ) ) = L i − 1 2 L i ( log L i − 1 L i − log L i , eq − 1 L i , eq ) + 1 2 L i ( log 1 L i − log 1 L i , eq ) ( S33 ) We then arrive at : J T GSG T J = J T ( δµ − D ) J = J T ( dk − D [ p ] ) ( S34 ) So when δµ − D = L − 1 , we obtain Eq . ( 13 ) in the main text . S5 . THE THERMODYNAMIC BOUND FOR DRIVING IS IMPROVED BY CONSIDERING INDIVIDUAL CURRENTS INSTEAD OF THE TOTAL CURRENT IN THE TUR We use Eq . ( S12 ) to re - write Eq . ( 7 ) : ˙ σ = J tot (cid:32) L α − 1 L α + L β log k f , 1 αα k f , 2 αα k b , 1 αα k b , 2 αα + L β − 1 L α + L β log k f , 1 ββ k f , 2 ββ k b , 1 ββ k b , 2 ββ + 1 L α + L β log k f , 1 αβ k f , 2 αβ k f , 1 βα k f , 2 βα k b , 1 ββ k b , 2 ββ k b , 1 βα k b , 2 βα (cid:33) ( S35 ) S8 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 10 100 k grow ( nm / s ) 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 t an φ FIG . S4 . Coeﬃcient tan φ at various actin polymerization rates k grow . The parameters are the same as in Fig . 5 . We combine Eqs . ( S1 ) , ( S2 ) , ( S35 ) and ( S36 ) to obtain the following expression for entropy production in terms of ∆ µ and ε diss in Eq . ( 8 ) and Eq . ( 9 ) ˙ σ = J tot ( ∆ µ − ε diss ) ( S36 ) We ﬁrst plot the second law bound and the TUR bound ( Eq . ( 15 ) ) in Fig . 5 . The TUR bound is much better than the second law bound because it encodes the kinetic information of the process . It deviates from the real driving at intermediate polymerization rate k grow = 1 nm / s . For further improvement , we can adapt the MTUR bound [ 37 ] to this process . We deﬁne the ﬂuxes of adding α and β ABPs as J α = J ω m − 1 , α , ω m , α + J ω m − 1 , β , ω m , α and J β = J ω m − 1 , α , ω m , β + J ω m − 1 , β , ω m , β . The MTUR bound given by Eq . ( 14 ) is the same as considering the scalar observable J tot (cid:48) = cos φJ α + sin φJ β and then maximizing 2 (cid:104) J tot (cid:48) (cid:105) 2 / tJ tot (cid:10) δJ 2 tot (cid:48) (cid:11) by varying φ . We demonstrate below the derivation and plot the tan φ values that optimize the bound as a function of k grow . Inserting the expression of J tot (cid:48) into the bound of 2 (cid:104) J tot (cid:48) (cid:105) 2 / tJ tot (cid:10) δJ 2 tot (cid:48) (cid:11) , we obtain ∆ µ (cid:62) ε diss + 2 ( J α + tan φJ β ) 2 tJ tot ( (cid:104) δJ α 2 (cid:105) + tan 2 φ (cid:104) δJ β 2 (cid:105) + 2 tan φ (cid:104) δJ α δJ β (cid:105) ) ( S37 ) We take the derivative of Eq . ( S37 ) against tan φ and ﬁnd that the maximum value is achieved when tan φ = −(cid:104) δJ α δJ β (cid:105) J α + (cid:104) δJ α 2 (cid:105) J β −(cid:104) δJ α δJ β (cid:105) J β + (cid:104) δJ β 2 (cid:105) J α . ( S38 ) We substitute Eq . ( S38 ) for tan φ in Eq . ( S37 ) and obtain the following MTUR bound for the bundling process . ∆ µ (cid:62) ε diss + 2 ( J 2 α (cid:104) δJ β 2 (cid:105) − 2 (cid:104) δJ α δJ β (cid:105) J α J β + J 2 β (cid:104) δJ α 2 (cid:105) ) tJ tot ( −(cid:104) δJ α δJ β (cid:105) 2 + (cid:104) δJ α 2 (cid:105)(cid:104) δJ β 2 (cid:105) ) . ( S39 ) This is equivalent to Eq . ( 14 ) , where we simplify the expression using J = (cid:18) J α J β (cid:19) , dk = (cid:18) log dk α log dk β (cid:19) and D [ p ] = (cid:18) D ( P ( α ) | | P eq ( α ) ) D ( P ( β ) | | P eq ( β ) ) (cid:19) . ( S40 ) Fig . S4 shows the value of tan φ in Eq . ( S38 ) at various k grow . This coeﬃcient is obtained by maximizing the bound in Eq . ( S37 ) at each data point . It provides information about the strength of the correlation between the two currents . We compare this bound with the one given by the TUR ( Eq . ( 15 ) ) in Fig . 5 and discuss their performance in the main text . To further analyze how the variance and covariance of ﬂuxes modulate the value of tan φ and the amount of driving used to maintain the correlation between ﬂuxes , we rearrange the expression of tan φ as follows . tan φ = J α J β   −(cid:104) δJ α δJ β (cid:105) J α J β + (cid:104) δJ α 2 (cid:105) J α 2 −(cid:104) δJ α δJ β (cid:105) J α J β + (cid:104) δJ β 2 (cid:105) J β 2   ( S41 ) S9 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 10 100 k grow ( nm / s ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 J α / J β FIG .

Green points are the covariance normalized by the magnitude of the two currents ( −(cid:104) δJ α δJ β (cid:105) / J α J β ) . Fig . S4 shows that the ratio between currents J α / J β has the same non - monotonic dependence on actin polymerization rate as tan φ . This is consistent with Eq . ( S41 ) . On the other hand , the normalized variance and covariance of currents −(cid:104) δJ α δJ β (cid:105) / J α J β , (cid:104) δJ α 2 (cid:105) / J 2 α and (cid:104) δJ β 2 (cid:105) / J 2 β have similar orders of magnitude for a given k grow ( Fig . S6 ) , suggesting that the value of tan φ is weakly dependent on the second term on the right side of Eq . ( S41 ) . We conclude that tan φ , as well as the strength of the correlation between ﬂuxes is mainly determined by the ratio between the two currents .
