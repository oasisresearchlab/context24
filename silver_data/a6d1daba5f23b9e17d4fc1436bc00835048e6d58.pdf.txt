The aim of this study was to investigate whether the experience of awe impacts on peculiar dimensions of creative potential in terms of creative thinking . Fifty - two university students were exposed both to an awe - inducing 3D - video and to a neutral one in a within - subject design . After each video , participants reported the intensity and type of perceived emotion and completed two verbal tasks of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking ( TTCT ; Torrance , 1974 ) . A direct causal relationship between awe and creative thinking was tested using generalized linear model . Results showed that awe affected key creative thinking components — ﬂ uency , ﬂ exibility and elaboration measured by the product improvement test — compared to the neutral stimulus . Implications of these ﬁ ndings for future research and limitations are discussed . still remember my wife and me crying bitterly after his birth . As other parents looked fondly at their new babies , we went to the window to see the ambulance below taking our son from us — perhaps forever . … At this most terrible moment in our young lives , and despite our fears , we felt a strangely overwhelming sense that something magni ﬁ cent was taking place , that we were being immersed together in something — some process — that was in ﬁ nitely beyond what we could ever understand , but that we were destined to keep trying . I know now that what we felt was the most intense , wonderful , upsetting , and transcendently terrible of all human emotions : awe . ( Pearsall , 2007 , pp . ( Introduction ) : XII - XIII ) There are some profound and rare experiences able to alter our perception of the world and of ourselves deeply and suddenly ( Pearsall , 2007 ; Schneider , 2009 ) . This is the case of awe , which is a complex emotion associated with moments of deep and personal change ( Schneider , 2009 ) . Given the intrinsically composited nature of this emotion , psychology has begun to study it only recently . However , several discoveries have been made regarding awe , especially in the experimental ﬁ eld ( e . g . , Campos , Shiota , Keltner , Gonzaga , & Goetz , 2013 ; Cohen , Gruber , & Keltner , 2010 ; Keltner & Haidt , 2003 ; Shiota , Keltner , & Mossman , 2007 ; Simon - Thomas , Keltner , Sauter , Sinicropi - Yao , & Abramson , 2009 ; Stellar et al . , 2015 ) . Most experimental research on awe relied on the reference model of Keltner and Haidt ( 2003 ) , which posed vastness and need for accommodation as the core appraisals of this emotion . Speci ﬁ cally , this emotion arises in front of “ massive ” stimuli ( pragmatically or conceptually ; Silvia , Fayn , Nusbaum , & Beaty , 2015 ; p . 377 ) able to chal - lenge and expand individuals ’ mental frames .

By expanding people ’ s mental frames , awe could also help them ﬁ nd new connections among objects or ideas . Speci ﬁ cally , it was hypothesized that awe could be related to the ability to discover new links among ideas , concepts or objects , that is , to creative thinking , as a measure of creative potential , which can increase the probability to implement creative behavior ( Guilford , 1967 ; Torrance , 1974 ) . Akin to awe ’ s cognitive com - ponents , creative thinking is the ability to recombine ideas and to ﬁ nd new relationships between them ( Guilford , 1950 ; Torrance , 1969 ) . It is one of the main layers of creative perfor - mance and personal achievement ( Runco , Millar , Acar , & Cramond , 2010 ) , and one of the core cognitive processes of creativity ( Runco & Acar , 2012 ; Torrance , 1974 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , the cognitive component of vastness , in the case of awe , was related to the prototypical elicitors of awe , which included grand and vast panorama ( Keltner & Haidt , 2003 ; Shiota et al . , 2007 ) . Taking this into account , it was demonstrated that spaciousness could enhance creative potential ( van Rompay & Jol , 2016 ) both self - reported and evaluated by external coders . In this study , it was hypothesized that prototypical vast and grand awe elicitors would be creativity conductive . In addition , in this research , it was assumed that awe could enhance the ability to discover new connections among ideas also due to its need for accommodation component ( i . e . , the need for updating current mental frames in line with new incoming information ) . This need would arise from a shift between previous knowledge and the new one ( Piaget & Inhelder , 1969 ) . In this regard , Ritter et al . ( 2012 ) demonstrated that uncommon and unexpected experiences , in which people feel actively involved ( i . e . , the so - called diversifying experi - ences ) could enhance the ability of ﬁ nding new links among ideas . Finally , Fong ( 2006 ) demonstrated that ambivalent and ambiguous emotional states entailing both negative and positive dimensions were conductive to creativity . Awe , as an ambigu - ous emotion ( Lazarus , 1991 ) , could thus enhance creativity . In spite of this potential af ﬁ nity between awe and creativity , no research has explored their relationship yet . Here , a laboratory study , which examined the relationships between awe and crea - tive potential compared to an emotional neutral content , was presented . To capture the impact of the complex emotion of awe on creativity , the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking ( TTCT ; Torrance , 1974 ) was selected as a measure of creative potential . Be fore presenting the study , existing research on awe as well as on creativity and emotions was reviewed . AWE Awe is a composite emotion that can impact positively on several aspects of individuals ’ life ( Chirico , Yaden , Riva , & Gaggioli , 2016b ; Shiota et al . , 2007 ) . At the social level , awe can facilitate the emergence of prosocial behaviors and attitudes toward even unknown others ( Prade & Saroglou , 2016 ) . At the individual level , this emotion can amplify people ’ s perception of time ( Rudd et al . , 2012 ) , support spiritual beliefs ( Van Cappellen & Saroglou , 2012 ) , and affect people ’ body image ( van Elk , Karinen , Specker , Stamkou , & Baas , 2016 ) . Moreover , it was demonstrated that proneness to awe protected against interleukin - 6 pro - tein , which is related to the emergence of chronic or depres - sive disorders ( Stellar et al . , 2015 ) . At a higher level , awe can change peoples ’ general perspectives toward the world and themselves ( Schneider , 2009 ; Shiota et al . , 2007 ; Stellar et al . , 2015 ; Valdesolo & Graham , 2014 ) . Regarding this latter aspect , most scholars conceived this emotion as one of the mechanisms at the base of human knowledge ( i . e . , Shiota et al . , 2007 ; Silvia 2010 ) . Awe arises from stimuli that are so vast ( both perceptually and conceptually ) as to require an updating of people ’ s current mental schemas ( Keltner & Haidt , 2003 ) . Individuals who experienced awe feel the need to accommodate their previous mental frames according to new information , instead of simply assimilating it ( Keltner & Haidt , 2003 ) . Awe thus contributes to expanding people ’ mental frames and can open to new perspectives toward self and others by generating new knowledge that was previously ignored ( Schneider , 2009 ; Sung & Yih , 2015 ) . At the dispositional level , awe was closely related to the trait of openness to experience ( Silvia et al . , 2015 ) , that is , the more open - mind the person was , the more he or she was prone to experience awe . Indeed , the openness to experience personality trait was found associated to creativity itself ( e . g . , Agnoli , Franchin , Rubaltelli , & Corazza , 2015 ; Batey , Chamorro - Premuzic , & Furnham , 2010 ; Leung & Chiu , 2008 ; McCrae , 1987 ; Prabhu , Sutton , & Sauser , 2008 ) . In this study , it was suggested that this awe potential could be related to the cognitive side of creativity , that is , to creative thinking . Creative thinking is the ability to explore new con - nections among ideas , ﬁ nding new possible combinations ( Guilford , 1959 , 1967 ; Torrance , 1974 , 1969 ; Torrance , Sprini , & Tomasello , 1989 ) . Awe could open new perspectives even on a speci ﬁ c task , thus helping ﬁ nd new possible solu - tions . In other words , awe can make mental frames more ﬂ exible and accommodating . At the same time , awe itself is elicited by vast and grand natural phenomena ( e . g . , high mountains , tornados , droplets of colored water colliding with a milk ; Piff , Dietze , Feinberg , Stancato , & Keltner , 2015 ) , distant grand panor - ama ( Shiota et al . , 2007 ) , as well as abstract vast inductors ( i . e . , big ideas ) ( Fredericks , 2017 ; Keltner & Haidt , 2003 ) . In this regard , Liberman , Polack , Hameiri , and Blumenfeld ( 2012 ) showed that spacious natural images can enhance creative thinking abilities ( i . e . , ﬂ uency and originality ) in a sample of high school students ranging from 13 to 15 years old . Here , it was hypothesized that , also , adults ’ mental frames can be affected by such spacious stimuli . 124 A . CHIRICO ET AL . One of the main hypotheses of our work is that common awe elicitors , such as a forest of tall trees , can enhance the ﬂ uency and originality dimensions of creativity also in adults . Despite this emphasis on the concept of vastness , awe includes another relevant component , which is the need for accommodation . This can be de ﬁ ned as the urge to update current mental frames to new knowledge . This need is trig - gered by an incongruence between what it is known and the new incoming information ( Piaget & Inhelder , 1969 ) . Ritter et al . ( 2012 ) demonstrated that uncommon and unexpected experiences , in which people feel actively involved ( i . e . , the so - called diversifying experiences ) , enhanced one of the main component of creativity , that is , cognitive ﬂ exibility ( i . e . , the ability to discover new associations between ideas ; Guilford , 1967 ; Torrance , 1969 ) . In this study , participants were exposed to stimuli intended to induce an extremely engaging and unusual emotion , that is awe . It was hypothe - sized that awe could enhance ﬂ exibility dimensions of crea - tivity due to the diversifying nature of it basic mechanism , that is , the need for accommodation . Finally , awe is considered as a complex emotion entailing a double valence . Speci ﬁ cally , according to the reference model of Keltner and Haidt ( 2003 ) , different ﬂ avors of awe ( i . e . , threat , beauty , ability , virtue ; supernatural causality ) exist and depend on speci ﬁ c awe elicitors . Researches drawing from their model conceived awe consequently . Some treated awe as a positive emotion ( Campos et al . , 2013 ; Griskevicius , Shiota , & Neufeld , 2010 ; Shiota , Campos , & Keltner , 2003 ; Shiota , Keltner , & John , 2006 ) . Others conceived the negative valence of awe as a special case of this emotion ( Gordon et al . , 2016 ; Piff et al . , 2015 ) . However , a recent research on awe demonstrated that it has not a de ﬁ ned and univocal valence , at least regarding the microfacial valence components of this emotion ( Chirico , Cipresso , & Yaden , et al . , 2017 ) . Here , awe - inducing stimuli were considered , in which the positive and the negative affect components were pretested to reach a balance , to reproduce the genuine ambiguous nature of this emotion even in a laboratory setting ( Chirico , Cipresso , & Gaggioli , 2017 , 2016a ) . CREATIVITY AND EMOTIONS The interest in the relationship between awe and creativity is rooted in the wider and well - established ﬁ eld of emotion and creativity ( Baas , De Dreu , & Nijstad , 2008 ; Kaufmann & Vosburg , 2002 ; Lin , Tsai , Lin , & Chen , 2014 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , researchers have focused on how emotions could enhance dif - ferent creativity components ( Baas et al . , 2008 ; Lin et al . , 2014 ) . In spite of the multifaceted nature of creativity , at the assessment level , most researchers drew from the model of Paul Torrance ( 1974 , 1969 ) focused on creative potential . According to this model , creativity includes four main underlying dimensions , that are : ﬂ uency ( the number of ideas generated ) , ﬂ exibility ( genera - tion of different ideational approaches or categories ) , originality ( generation of uncommon ideas ) , and elaboration ( how well detailed are the products ) . A detailed meta - analysis , carried out by Baas et al . ( 2008 ) , grouped Torrance ’ s dimensions into three categories ( ﬂ uency , cognitive ﬂ exibility , and originality ) to ana - lyze the impact of emotional factors on creativity , also due to the problematic nature of the dimension of elaboration ( Cramond , Matthews - Morgan , Bandalos , & Zuo , 2005 ) . They evidenced that the speci ﬁ c combinations of hedonic tune ( i . e . , emotional valence ) , activation ( i . e . , activating or deactivating states ) , and regulatory focus ( i . e . , prevention or promotion self - regulation focus ; Higgins , 1997 ; Idson , Liberman , & Higgins , 2000 ) could enhance speci ﬁ c dimensions of creativity . They also found that , generally , positive and activating moods , compared with neutral ones , increased mainly cognitive ﬂ exibility component . Moreover , fear and anger ( i . e . , negative moods ) were related to increased originality and ﬂ uency , but not with cognitive ﬂ ex - ibility . Despite the relevance of these results , the authors high - lighted a literature bias related to the overinvestigation of some moods , compared to others ( e . g . , happiness , sadness , relaxation ) . Moreover , Baas et al . ( 2008 ) considered only studies which focused on basic emotions or moods . Adding to this area of study , a recent work of Jovanovic , Meinel , Schrödel , and Voigt ( 2016 ) highlighted the need to study the interaction between positive and negative emotional states , which occur not only subsequently ( Bledow , Rosing , & Frese , 2013 ) but also simultaneously ( Fong , 2006 ) . Fong ( 2006 ) focused on the workplace domain to investigate the relationship between ambiguous emotional affects and creativ - ity . According to the informational approaches on emotions ( Forgas , 2000 ) , Fong postulated that emotional ambivalence provides information about an environment . The unusual asso - ciation between opposite emotions indicates that a person is an environment in which other atypical relationships can occur . In other words , according to Fong ( 2006 ) , ambivalent emotions should make people more sensitive to unusual associations , thus enhancing their cognitive ﬂ exibility . They demonstrated that emotionally ambivalent events , which were perceived also as unusual , facilitated unusual associations in the subsequent remote associates task ( Mednick , 1962 ) . Awe can be considered a prototypical case of ambivalent emotion ( Chirico et al . , 2017 ; Lazarus , 1991 ) . Here , it was suggested that also awe ’ s ambivalent nature could contribute to make people more sensitive to new and uncommon relat ionship among ideas and object , thus impacting on their cognitive ﬂ exibility . However , no study has addressed yet the relationship between awe and creativity . THIS RESEARCH : AWE AND CREATIVITY IN VIRTUAL REALITY In this research , we examined the role of intense experiences of awe elicited with the help of a new advanced emotion induction technique , virtual reality ( VR ) , in enhancing CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL 125 creativity . It was hypothesized that the processes underlying awe ( i . e . , the two components of vastness and need for accommodation ) , as well as its emotionally ambiguous nat - ure , could improve creative performance . We sought to extend past works in two main ways . Nearly all research on emotions and creativity have consid - ered only basic emotions or general affective states ( Baas et al . , 2008 ) . However , emotions are often blended in real - life experiences and lead to the emergence of complex emotional states ( Jovanovic et al . , 2016 ) , such as awe . Hence , studying the awe - creativity link could improve both ecological validity of experimental studies in this ﬁ eld , and it can bring evidence about the causal links between awe and creativity for the ﬁ rst time . Second , to assess the generality of awe ’ s relationship with creativity , the participants were exposed to a potentially awe - inspiring content using a new emotion - induction procedure : VR . VR has been suggested as a potential way to induce higher intensity awe in the lab . This aspect is relevant because it has been noted that low - level emotional states did not impact on creativity as much as moderate ones : An optimal level of activation is needed for an emotional state to actually impact creativity ( Davis , 2009 ) . Therefore , the intensity com - ponent can be crucial for the investigation of awe - creativity link . In this regard , as Westermann , Stahl , and Hesse ( 1996 ) demonstrated , mood - induction procedures differ regarding their ability to induce speci ﬁ c moods . Some procedure led to greater intensity longer - lasting emotional states than others . Speci ﬁ cally , Ellard , Farchione , and Barlow ( 2012 ) argued that it exists a suitable procedure for each speci ﬁ c emotional state , thus impacting on the quality of the experi - ence itself . Therefore , the emotion - induction procedure needs to be considered carefully when it comes to studying the impact of speci ﬁ c emotions on creativity . Emotion - induction pro - cedures eliciting low or very high levels of the target emo - tion might not help us detect a relationship with creativity , even if one does exist . Here , VR was used because it has proved to be an effective emotion - induction procedure , able to elicit awe in the lab ( Chirico et al . , 2016b ; Chirico , Cipresso , & Yaden , et al . , 2017 ) . The use of VR can help researchers provide an optimal emotional state by manipulating the intensity level of awe in a laboratory setting . Indeed , inducing intense instances of awe is a crucial issue within awe experimental ﬁ eld ( Silvia et al . , 2015 ) . In this research , participants were exposed to two vali - dated VR contents . The ﬁ rst was an awe - inducing content ( i . e . , displaying a scene of tall trees ) and the second displayed a neutral content ( i . e . , hens wandering ) . Finally , after watching each video , participants were required to complete two questionnaires on emotions and speci ﬁ cally on awe , and two verbal subtests of the TTCT ( Torrance , 1974 ) . METHOD Sample and Participants Selection The sample consisted of 52 adults ( 26 women and 26 men ) from Lombardy , region of Italy , who voluntarily took part in the research . The sample was young ( mean age = 24 . 9 ; SD = . 214 ) with an average number of years in education of 16 . 83 ( SD = 2 . 587 ) . Ten participants were workers ; among them , 5 were also students . The remaining partici - pants were only students . Fifty - one participants were unmar - ried and only one was married . All participants were resident in Lombardy , a region of Italy . Participants who ( at the time of the experiment ) reported vestibular and / or balance disorders were excluded . The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore prior to data collection . Each participant provided written informed consent for study participation . The whole proce - dure was carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration . Materials and Methods Participants were placed in an isolated room , gave consent , and completed demographics . Participants then put on a VR head - mounted display ( Gear VR ) combined with a smart - phone ( i . e . , Galaxy Note 4 ) , and they were provided with standardized instructions about how to make each video start using this VR device . After the participants had worn Gear VR , and had ﬁ xed the arrow button ( to make the video start ) the experimenter touched the lateral pad and the video started . Each participant watched both videos individually and in a counterbalanced order . The awe - inducing video depicted a scene of tall trees inspired from the experiment of Piff et al . ( 2015 ) . The neutral video showed hens wander - ing in the grass , and it was used a contrast condition in line with previous studies ( e . g . , Griskevicius et al . , 2010 ; Prade & Saroglou , 2016 ) . Each video lasted 2 min and was made up of these subsections : ( a ) black screen lasting 6 , 000 ms , ( b ) a sound ( lasting 500 ms ) allowing the experimenter to know that the video started , ( c ) black screen appearing 8 , 000 ms after the sound , and ( d ) ﬁ rst scene appearing 14 , 000 seconds after the beginn ing of the whole video . KolorEye App was used to display videos on a 360° screen , by using the function “ 360° ” ( for 360° immersive spherical display ) . Kolor Eyes 1 . 5 App is a free 360° video player for Windows , Mac , HTML5 , iOS and Android . We conducted a separate pilot study to ensure that the two content conditions induced the target emotions . In the pilot study , 36 participants watched four video contents : ( a ) amusing , ( b ) awe - inspiring showing a grand vista on the mountains , ( c ) awe - inspiring 126 A . CHIRICO ET AL . depicting a scene of tall trees in a forest , and ( d ) neutral ( hens wandering on grass ) . Each of the aforementioned videos was created ad hoc by using ShotCut video - editing free online tool ( for further details , please see Chirico et al . , 2017 ) . Participants were required to rate the extent to which they experienced several different emotional states using single items ( 1 = not at all , 7 = extremely ) : anger , disgust , fear , pride , sadness , joy , amusement , and awe . The pilot study revealed that awe - inspiring video depicting a scene of tall trees in a forest was the most effective one , and that neutral content acted as a suitable contrast condition to analyze awe intensity . A Wilcoxon - Signed Rank test indicated that awe - inducing video displaying tall trees and awe - indu - cing video displaying high mountains induced the high - est levels of awe compared to the amusing video ( tall trees vs . amusement : Z = − 4 . 100 ; p < 0 . 001 ; high mountains vs . amusement : Z = − 3 . 999 ; p < 0 . 001 ) and to neutral one ( tall trees vs . neutral : Z = − 4 . 840 ; p < 0 . 001 ; high mountains vs . neutral : Z = − 4 . 861 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . At the same time , amusing video and neutral one did not induce a signi ﬁ cantly different level of awe ( Z = − 2 . 337 ; p = 0 . 02 ) . In this research , after each video , participants again reported the extent to which they experienced the afore - mentioned eight emotions using single items ( from 1 = not at all to 7 = extremely ) ( Chirico , Ferrise , Cordella , & Gaggioli , 2018 ) . At the same time , they reported they level of vastness and need for accommoda - tion ( i . e . , components of awe ) on a 7 - point Likert scale ( Chirico , Cipresso , & Yaden , et al . , 2017 ) . Finally , after each video , participants completed the Italian version of the subtest 4 ( i . e . , product improvement ) and 5 ( i . e . , unusual uses ) of the TTCT ( Torrance , 1974 ; Torrance et al . , 1989 ) . Each of these subtests was scored for ﬂ uency , originality , and ﬂ exibility . The whole experi - ment lasted about 45 min . RESULTS Preliminary Data Analysis Two normality tests ( i . e . , Kolmogorov - Smirnov and Shapiro - Wilk ) were carried out to determine if variables were normally distributed . Because this condition was not satis ﬁ ed , a Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for each of the creativity dimensions and awe components was carried out , in order to test the effect of awe ( vs . neutral stimulus ) on creativity . Discriminant Ability of Each Stimulus Results showed that awe - inducing video resulted in a sig - ni ﬁ cantly higher score of awe ( Mdn = 6 . 00 ) than the neutral one ( Mdn = 3 . 00 , Z = − 5 . 479 , p < . 001 ) ] , with a large effect size ( r 2 = 0 . 760 ) . Descriptive statistics of each emotion induced by Awe and Neutral inducing stimuli is reported in Table 1 . Moreover , to test the hypothesis that single awe components of vastness and need for accommodation are equal across condi - tion , a dependent sample t - test was performed . Because each variable resulted as normally distributed , a dependent t - test was carried out . Results showed statistically signi ﬁ cant differ - ences in vastness , t ( 51 ) = 12 . 691 , p < . 001 , and need for accommodation , t ( 51 ) = 3 . 334 , p < . 001 , dimensions of awe across the two conditions . Participants reported a signi ﬁ cantly higher sense of vastness in the awe condition ( mean = 4 . 52 ; SD = 1 . 045 ) compared to the neutral one ( mean = 2 . 6 ; SD = 1 . 50 ) . At the same time , also the perception of the need for accommodation was signi ﬁ cantly higher in the awe condi - tion ( mean = 2 . 82 ; SD = 1 . 356 ) than in the neutral one ( mean = 2 . 26 ; SD = 1 . 058 ) . Awe and Creativity Did the awe - inspiring video induce higher creativity levels than the neutral one ? Awe versus neutral videos ’ creativity levels for each of the creativity subcomponents ( i . e . , ﬂ u - ency , ﬂ exibility , originality , elaboration ) and regarding each subtest ( i . e . , product improvement and unusual uses ) were compared . Table 2 shows descriptive statistics concerning creativity scores for product improvement subtest and unu - sual uses subtest . We carried out a Wilcoxon - Signed Ranks Test to com - pare creativity subcomponents levels ( i . e . , ﬂ uency , ﬂ exibil - ity , originality and elaboration ) between the awe - inducing and the neutral condition , and regarding each creativity subtest . Results showed that awe - inspiring video induced signi ﬁ - cantly higher levels of ﬂ uency ( Z = − 2 . 696 ; p < 0 . 001 ; r = 0 . 374 ) , ﬂ exibility ( Z = − 3 . 782 ; p < 0 . 001 ; r = 0 . 524 ) , TABLE 1 Anger , disgust , fear , pride , amusement , sadness , joy and awe descriptive statistics in the awe and neutral condition Awe Condition Neutral Condition Measure M SD M SD Z p Anger 1 . 56 1 . 127 1 . 83 1 . 382 - − 1 . 231 . 218 Disgust 1 . 33 1 . 004 2 . 35 1 . 725 − 3 . 761 < . 001 Fear 2 . 13 1 . 534 2 . 02 1 . 393 − 2 . 10 . 834 Pride 2 . 27 1 . 548 1 . 79 1 . 362 − 2 . 614 . 009 Amusement 3 . 77 1 . 926 3 . 94 2 . 033 − 8 . 57 . 392 Sadness 1 . 83 1 . 491 1 . 77 1 . 409 − 1 . 99 . 842 Joy 4 . 48 1 . 925 2 . 92 1 . 877 − 3 . 692 < . 001 Awe 5 . 87 1 . 138 3 . 38 2 . 097 − 5 . 479 < . 0001 Note . n = 52 . Emotions scores were not all normally distributed . Therefore , a Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was carried out to compare each emotion level between awe and neutral condition . CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL 127 originality ( Z = − 4 . 402 ; p < 0 . 001 ; r = 0 . 610 ) and elaboration ( Z = − 3 . 233 ; p = 0 . 001 ; r = 0 . 448 ) in product improvement subtest , compared with the neutral video . At the same time , awe inspiring video induced signi ﬁ cantly higher levels of ﬂ uency ( Z = − 3 . 571 ; p < 0 . 001 ; r = 0 . 495 ) , ﬂ exibility ( Z = − 4 . 541 ; p < 0 . 001 ; r = 0 . 629 ) , originality ( Z = − 5 . 357 ; p < 0 . 001 ; r = 0 . 742 ) and elaboration ( Z = − 3 . 778 ; p = 0 . 001 ; r = 0 . 523 ) also in unusual uses subtest , compared with the neutral video . Finally , to test the causal relationship between creativity and awe , a generalized linear model was carried out which does not assume , necessarily , a normal distribution of variables and can accept a violation of sphericity ( Agresti & Kateri , 2011 ) . Because the hypotheses were based on the single dimensions of awe ( i . e . , vastness and need for accom - modation ) , as well as on the global measure of awe , the model tested included awe , need for accommodation , and vastness measures for predicting each creativity dimension for both subtests . All models tested are reported here Table 3 . The global measure of awe resulted a signi ﬁ cant predic - tor of ﬂ uency , ﬂ exibility and elaboration for product improvement subtest . Originality was not affected by awe . Creativity dimensions of unusual uses subtest were not signi ﬁ cantly affected by perceived awe . DISCUSSION This research examined the impact of awe on creativity using an advanced emotion - induction procedure : immersion within VR . Awe is a complex emotion that is dif ﬁ cult to reproduce or induce in laboratory settings . However , the existing literature highlighted that only an optimal emo - tional intensity level could impact creativity ( Davis , 2009 ) . Because it was demonstrated that VR can enhance the level of awe even in the lab ( Chirico , Cipresso , & Gaggioli , 2017 ) , VR was introduced to maximize the probability to detect the effect of this emotion on creativity , if one actually existed . Speci ﬁ cally , it was hypothesized that due to awe cognitive appraisal and ambivalent emotional valence , this emotion could impact creativity . These hypotheses were partially supported by the ﬁ nd - ings . Awe - inducing condition was followed by a higher level of creativity than the neutral ( control ) condition . With respect to previous research contrasting emotions with a neutral content ( Baas et al . , 2008 ) , it was found that awe affected key creativity components — ﬂ uidity , ﬂ ex - ibility , and elaboration measured by the product improve - ment subtest — compared to the neutral stimulus . This could be a further instance supporting a more integrative approach toward creativity - emotion link . It could be useful to carry on the study of other complex emotions , as it has successfully TABLE 3 Generalized linear model statistics Vastness Need for Accommodation Awe Global TTCT Subtest Creativity dimension B χ 2 Sign .

CHIRICO ET AL . been done with nostalgia ( Holak & Havlena , 1998 ; van Tilburg , Sedikides , & Wildschut , 2015 ) , to investigate the impact of simultaneous emotions on human cognitive pro - cesses . This would reconnect experimental study of emo - tions to their real - life occurrence . At a higher level , it was shown that inducing awe positively in ﬂ uenced creative thinking . The experimental design and our results are preliminary ; however , the implications of this study are more extensive . First , this is the ﬁ rst study explicitly investigating the rela - tionships between awe and creativity , suggesting the exis - tence of a causal link . This contributed to improving knowledge about the role of this complex emotion , which includes other emotional subcomponents ( i . e . , joy , sadness , fear ) , on creativity emergence . Indeed , emotions are usually blended in real life , and it is rare to live only a pure emotion alone . However , research has focused mainly on moods or single discrete emotional states ( Davis , 2009 ) . Experimental psychology has long considered emotions as moods or single discrete emotional states , and this led to increasing the gap with reality . On the other hand , organizational psychology attempted to reduce this gap by introducing concepts such as simultaneous , mixed , and ambivalent emo - tional states ( Fong , 2006 ; Jovanovic et al . , 2016 ) . However , the prototypical case of the complex and ambivalent emo - tion of awe has not been considered yet . This is the ﬁ rst study that addressed , explicitly , the link between this emotion and creativity . Given the complex nature of both these processes , a suitable technique able to control for the impact of awe on creativity was required . Indeed , other disciplines , such as environmental psy - chology , have focused on the effects of spacious stimuli in enhancing creativity ( van Rompay & Jol , 2016 ) , or on the impact of schema violation on creativity ( Ritter et al . , 2012 ) . However , VR can allow integrating all these pre - vious manipulations , thus inducing an intense version of the complex emotion of awe in a safe and controlled setting ( Chirico et al . , 2016b ) . For instance , the degree of schema violation could be manipulated along with the level of vastness , thus exploring their impact on creativity dimensions . VR is a source of paradoxical experiences , as Ritter and colleagues ( 2012 ) demonstrated . It is possible to combine this potential with the spatial dimension of VR to explore the weight of each of these components on awe emergence and on a subsequent creativity task . Finally , VR allows for inducing a quite intense and ambivalent version of awe , which is closer to awe in the real life ( Chirico , Cipresso , & Yaden , et al . , 2017 ) . This allows for carefully managing and exploring this complex feeling , even in a controlled setting . In other words , since awe is a delicate emotion entailing intense mixed emotional components ( especially a component of fear ) , it requires a special technique to be safely induced . VR can be this technique . Limitations Despite the potential of awe in enhancing creativity , some limitations exist . This study could be improved mainly in four ways . First , the effect of other potential intervenient emotions on creativity was carefully controlled by adding a neutral condition . With this regard , the contents of the two videos were comparable . They both displayed natural scenes , either of tall trees or of hens wandering . However , only a neutral and an awe - inspiring content were consid - ered , and it could be relevant to compare awe - contents with stimuli conveying positive or negative emotions . This would evidence the creative potential of awe as a complex emotion , with respect to other basic emotions with a de ﬁ ned valence . For instance , future studies could proceed by con - trasting the effect of awe with other negatively and posi - tively valenced emotions , such as amusement or pride . This would allow controlling for the effect of other potentially intervenient variables . Second , the sample size was small , therefore , it could be useful to test the awe - creativity link with a larger sample . More , the focused was oriented toward a measure of crea - tive potential , which is creative thinking , but it could be interesting to investigate the impact of awe on creativity in terms of performance ( e . g . , O ’ Quin & Besemer , 2006 ) . Finally , it was considered a speci ﬁ c natural awe - inducing content ( i . e . , tall trees ) , in line with literature on this emo - tion . However , it could be useful also to take into account if different scenarios , such as abstract environments , or inter - actional awe - inspiring experiences , where more people navigate the same environment , could impact similarly on creativity . Future Research This study makes a ﬁ rst contribution to an emerging ﬁ eld of research in creativity studies — the relationship between awe and other complex emotions and creative thinking — and , in the future , several other domains of creativity could be included , such as music , education , sports . Awe could be used to enhance creativity in different domains , and this is an open empirical question with great practical conse - quences . VR was previously used to address the relationship between paradoxical situations and creativity ( Ritter et al . , 2012 ) . However , no one focused on intense complex emo - tions and creativity . One reason could be an ethical concern ( i . e . , sometimes awe can be a disruptive emotional state ) and the dif ﬁ cult to induce intense blended emotional states into controlled settings . Virtual Reality can help address both issues by opening a new ﬁ eld of analysis on the emotion - creativity link . An overall implication of this research could be to bring awe back to the everyday contexts of participants and develop guidelines for translating these initial research ﬁ nd - ings into actual creative performance . With this regard , a CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL 129 further step could be to assess creative performance and not only participants ’ creative potential . At a theoretical level , it is important for future works to explore the reasons why experiences of awe enhance crea - tive thinking . The common conceptual explanation found in the literature postulates the combined effect of perceiving vastness and the need for accommodation . However , it would be useful in subsequent studies to include other potential mediators of the impact of awe on creativity . To this aim , also alternative theoretical frameworks should also be explored . For instance , Glaveanu ( 2017 ) recently pro - posed that wonder can stimulate creativity but placing peo - ple in a meta - position , one from which multiple perspectives on the world become available . Experiences of awe could , in fact , help people adopt such a meta - position and , in effect , stimulate wonder and the exploration of new ideas . The mediated effect of wonder should be explored in future research , to unpack further the complex relationship between awe and creativity .
