INTRODUCTION Membrane tension is an important mechanical regulator of cell motility , integrating mechanical cues across the cell and inﬂuencing protrusion and retraction dynamics along the cell boundary ( 1 – 5 ) . Although membrane - tension mea - surements have been reported in various motile cell types , including ﬁbroblasts ( 5 ) , neutrophils ( 1 ) , and ﬁsh kerato - cytes ( 3 , 6 ) , the tension distribution in the plasma membrane of motile cells has remained largely unexplored . The plasma membrane exhibits properties of a two - dimensional ﬂuid , so that in stationary cells , membrane tension has to be homoge - neous and isotropic , whereas transient changes in tension should relax ( 7 , 8 ) . The typical timescale for tension relaxa - tion depends on the viscosity of the membrane and is relatively fast ( on the order of milliseconds ) compared to other cellular processes . During persistent cell movement , however , the plasma membrane undergoes a two - dimen - sional ﬂow , and steady - state gradients in membrane tension could arise . Two recent studies ( 9 , 10 ) analyzed this situation theoretically and showed that the primary factor generating a steady - state gradient of membrane tension is an effective viscous friction associated with movement of the cell membrane relative to the actin cytoskeleton in motile cells . This friction is mainly due to transmembrane anchors and adhesion proteins that are bound to the actin network and treadmill rearward with it . The movement of these cytoskel - eton - attached membrane proteins within the viscous lipid bilayer generates frictional drag . The cumulative drag force increases steeply with the area fraction of the transmem - brane cytoskeleton - attached anchors ( 9 , 10 ) . Previous measurements of plasma membrane ﬂow in motile cells indicated that the membrane passively translo - cates forward with respect to the extracellular substrate , staying essentially at rest in the cell frame of reference . This was shown for most motile cell types , including ﬁbroblasts ( 11 ) , keratocytes ( 12 – 14 ) , leukocytes ( 15 ) , and Dictyostelium amoebae ( 16 ) . Membrane ﬂows have been observed in neuronal growth cones ( 17 ) , where continuous incorporation of membrane at the growth cone generates a steady ﬂow of membrane from the growth cone toward the cell body . The lack of membrane ﬂow in the cell frame of reference of motile cells implies that the tension gradient that develops in the membrane counterbalances the frictional drag on the membrane generated by the treadmilling cyto - skeleton . The magnitude of the tension gradient is predicted to strongly depend on the density and distribution of the cytoskeleton - attached membrane anchors and adhesion complexes , and reasonable values of this density should lead to a considerable tension difference between the leading and trailing edges of motile cells ( 9 , 10 ) . Here , we test these predictions experimentally by examining the membrane - tension distribution in ﬁsh epithelial keratocytes , which are notorious for their persistent and rapid movement ( 3 , 18 , 19 ) .

Measurements are done 10 – 30 min after adding jasplakinolide . Tether - pulling experiments and force measurements Tether force measurements are carried out as in our previous work ( 3 ) with a laser tweezers system ( PALM microtweezers , Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Jena , Germany ) using a 63 (cid:1) 1 . 2 NA water immersion objective and a motorized stage ( Ludl Electronic Products , Hawthorne , NY ) on an in - verted microscope ( Axiovert 200M , Carl Zeiss ) . Trapping is done with a 3 W , 1064 nm Nd : YAG laser focused to a diffraction - limited spot , and im - aging by bright ﬁeld is done simultaneously . Tether force measurements on cells are done by attaching concanavalin - A - coated beads to motile keratocytes and measuring the force after tether formation . At the front , a coated bead is brought into contact with the membrane on the dorsal sur - face of the lamellipodium . The bead is pulled toward the leading edge and beyond it to form a tether by moving the stage . At the back , a bead is brought into contact with the cell membrane at the rear part of the cell body and pulled away by moving the stage . We correct the measured tether force for the contribution of the dynamic friction due to stage move - ment , when relevant , as previously ( 3 ) . The time intervals between sequential measurements within the same cell are between ~ 20 s and a few minutes . The order of measurements ( front before rear and vice versa ) did not inﬂuence the results . Apparent membrane - tension values , T , are calculated from the tether force , F T , using T ¼ ð F 2 T = 8 p 2 B Þ , where B ¼ 0 : 14 pN , m m is the measured bending modulus of the plasma mem - brane in keratocytes ( 3 , 22 ) . RESULTS Membrane tension is higher at the leading edge of motile keratocytes To characterize the membrane - tension distribution in rapidly moving ﬁsh keratocytes , we measure tension , using a tether - pulling assay ( 3 , 22 ) , at different positions along the cell boundary . Speciﬁcally , measurements are done ( a ) at the center of the leading edge and ( b ) behind the cell body at the rear ( Fig . 1 and Movies S1 and S2 , respectively , in the Supporting Material ) . Tethers are pulled from individual cells at both positions , often with more than one mea - surement performed at each location . The temporal order in which the front and rear measurements are performed does not matter . The population - averaged membrane ten - sion at the cell front is 365 5 26 pN / m m ( mean 5 SE ) , whereas the average tension at the rear is 280 5 21 pN / m m ( Fig . 1 C ) . Thus , the membrane tension is on average ~ 30 % higher at the leading edge compared to the trailing edge . The mean membrane - tension difference between the front and rear within individual cells is 85 5 19 pN / m m ( Fig . 1 D ) . Higher membrane - tension values at the leading edge compared to the trailing edge are also observed in cells treated with cytochalasin D ( Fig . S1 ) , which caps free barbed ends of actin ﬁlaments ( 23 ) and leads to a substantial reduction in membrane - tension values and speed ( 3 ) . The average difference between sequential tension measure - ments in control experiments in which the membrane tension is repeatedly measured at the same location is not signiﬁcantly different from zero ( Fig . S2 ) . Assuming that A B C D FIGURE 1 Membrane tension is higher at the leading edge of motile ker - atocytes .

Biophysical Journal 108 ( 7 ) 1599 – 1603 1600 Lieber et al . the membrane - tension gradient is distributed evenly from front to rear ( 9 , 10 ) , we can estimate the magnitude of the gradient by dividing the measured front - to - rear tension dif - ference by the front - to - rear length of cells ( 15 . 8 5 0 . 5 m m ; mean 5 SE , N ¼ 25 ) , which gives an average membrane - tension gradient of ~ 5 pN / m m 2 . To examine the importance of cell movement in gener - ating higher apparent tension at the leading edge , we exam - ined keratocytes in which cell movement was abolished by treating the cells with blebbistatin followed by jasplakino - lide ( 3 , 24 ) . This combination treatment interferes with actin disassembly processes and leads to rapid cessation of move - ment , essentially freezing the lamellipodial actin network ( 24 ) . In our previous work ( 3 ) , we found that the apparent membrane tension was severely diminished by this treat - ment , and we attributed the residual tension in frozen cells to the contribution of membrane - cytoskeleton attachment energy . Interestingly , we ﬁnd here that frozen cells have higher apparent tension at the cell rear than at the leading edge ( Fig . 2 ) , suggesting that membrane - cytoskeleton attachment energy is larger at the cortical region at the rear end of the cell body than at the leading edge . These re - sults are in striking contrast to motile keratocytes , where the apparent tension is higher at the leading edge ( Fig . 1 ) , emphasizing the importance of cell movement for gener - ating the observed front - to - rear tension difference . Membrane tension gradient in keratocyte fragments is similar to that in whole cells Lamellipodial fragments of keratocytes , which lack nuclei , microtubules , and most organelles , move with speed and persistence similar to those of whole cells ( 21 , 25 , 26 ) . These fragments are essentially stand - alone lamellipodia , contain - ing little besides a treadmilling actin network enclosed by a membrane . As such , fragments present an ideal model sys - tem for studying the membrane - tension distribution during steady lamellipodial motility . The tension in motile frag - ments is measured using a tether - pulling assay as in whole cells , except that in fragments , tethers can be pulled directly from the lamellipodium at both ends , since the rear part of the lamellipodium is also accessible ( Fig . 3 ) . The values of membrane tension at the leading edge of fragments are similar to those in whole cells ( Fig . 3 A ) , with a population average of 320 5 19 pN / m m ( mean 5 SE , N ¼ 22 ) in fragments , compared to 360 5 26 pN / m m ( N ¼ 15 ) in whole cells . The front - to - rear membrane - tension difference in fragments is measured as in cells , by performing se - quential measurements at the front and rear of the same fragment ( Fig . 3 , B and C ; Movie S3 ) . The resulting average front - to - rear membrane - tension difference in fragments is A B C FIGURE 2 Membrane tension in frozen cells is higher at the rear .

However , since fragments are smaller in width , the estimated tension gradient in fragments is ~ 5 pN / m m 2 , as in whole cells . DISCUSSION We measure the membrane - tension distribution in motile keratocytes and ﬁnd a steady - state membrane - tension difference between the cell front and rear , with ~ 30 % higher apparent tension values at the leading edge ( Fig . 1 ) . Local variations in the apparent membrane tension have been re - ported previously in neurons ( 17 ) and epithelial cells ( 27 ) . In epithelia , membrane - tension differences were measured between the apical and basal membranes and attributed to differences in membrane - cytoskeleton attachment energy ( 27 ) . In growth cones , which are generally characterized by very low membrane - tension values , a small membrane - tension gradient appeared to drive a measurable membrane ﬂow from the growth cone toward the cell body ( 17 ) . How is the membrane tension distributed in motile cells like keratocytes , which move persistently yet exhibit no apparent membrane ﬂow in the cell frame of reference ? Previous studies generally have mostly assumed , based on the ﬂuid nature of the membrane and the lack of bulk membrane ﬂow , that the tension distribution is homogenous during steady movement ( 8 , 19 , 21 ) . However , recent theoret - ical studies suggest that steady - state gradients in the lateral tension can develop in the membranes of moving cells ( 9 , 10 ) . The measurements presented here indeed show that measurable tension gradients exist in steadily moving keratocytes . The apparent membrane tension in keratocytes is domi - nated by the lateral tension in the membrane rather than the attachment energy between the cytoskeleton and the membrane ( 3 ) . What is the origin of the observed front - to - rear membrane - tension gradient in these cells ? Although we cannot completely rule out a contribution of local differ - ences in the membrane - cytoskeletal attachment energy , our data strongly suggest that the observed front - to - rear mem - brane - tension difference arises primarily from variations in the lateral membrane tension associated with cell move - ment . First , our results with frozen cells show that in the absence of cell movement , the difference between the apparent tension at the front and rear becomes small and negative ( Fig . 2 ) . Second , keratocyte cells and fragments exhibit the same front - to - rear tension gradient , despite the rather different cytoskeletal organization near the location of the tether origin at the rear ; in cells , the tether is pulled from a cortical region at the back of the cell body , whereas in fragments , the tether is pulled from the rear of the lamel - lipodium . Together , these results imply that differences in membrane - cytoskeleton attachment energy between the front and rear of the cell are minor , and that the main contri - bution to the front - to - rear membrane - tension gradient arises from differences in the in - plane ( lateral ) tension within the membrane of the moving cell . Our measurements in keratocyte cells , and in particular in keratocyte fragments , can be interpreted based on a recent theoretical model for the distribution of lateral tension in the membranes of moving cells ( 9 ) . This model assumes a simpliﬁed ﬂat cell geometry , which lacks a cell body , and thus resembles the shape of a keratocyte fragment . Accord - ing to the model , the membrane tension is generated by the protrusive force applied to the leading edge of the cell by the polymerizing actin ﬁlaments . The tension gradient is deter - mined by the viscous friction forces between the plasma membrane and transmembrane protein anchors that are bound to the treadmilling actin network and hence move rearward relative to the bulk of the membrane . The model predicts that the tension gradient increases with the area density of cytoskeleton - bound membrane anchors but is only weakly dependent on the density of adhesion molecules , except at extremely low adhesion values ( 9 ) . The density of cytoskeleton - bound protein anchors can be estimated based on the model : for a crawling speed of 0 . 2 m m / s , assuming an anchor cross section of 5 nm , the measured tension gradient of ~ 5 pN / m m 2 corresponds to a membrane area fraction of ~ 2 % covered by the anchors . The distance between anchors in this case can be estimated as l z 31 nm . The force exerted on one anchor by the mem - brane , originating from the membrane - anchor viscous fric - tion , thus has an approximate value of f z ð dT = dr Þ l 2 ¼ 5 pN = m m 2 (cid:1) ð 0 : 031 m m Þ 2 ¼ 0 : 005 pN . While this force leads to the observable tension gradient over cellular scales , it contributes only about 0 . 005 k B T to the energy of anchor dissociation from the lamellipodial actin network , and therefore has a negligibly small inﬂuence on the dissociation kinetics of the anchors . An additional prediction of the model concerns a possible rolling of the membrane with respect to the cell’s leading edge , reminiscent of a tank - treading motion . For the estimated anchor area fraction , the membrane rolling speed is predicted to be ~ 0 . 01 m m / s , which is an order of magnitude lower than cell speed and probably below the measurement detection limit ( 12 – 14 ) . CONCLUSIONS Overall , our results show that persistent membrane tension gradients can occur in motile cells , despite the ﬂuid nature of the membrane . Several recent studies have emphasized the important role of transient changes in membrane tension for coordinating and regulating cell boundary dynamics ( 1 , 5 , 28 , 29 ) . Local variation in the apparent membrane tension can similarly be functionally relevant , imposing distinct constraints on cell boundary dynamics at different cellular locations . For example , differences in the apparent membrane tension between the apical and basal surfaces in epithelia ( 27 ) generate spatial variations in the energy requirements for clathrin - mediated endocytosis and thus Biophysical Journal 108 ( 7 ) 1599 – 1603 1602 Lieber et al . differentially inﬂuence the actin dependence of clathrin - coat assembly at the apical and basal surface ( 30 ) . The difference in the apparent membrane tension between the leading edge and the trailing edge could also have functional signif - icance . For example , a front - to - rear gradient in membrane tension may assist directed membrane transport toward the leading edge by promoting exocytosis near the leading edge while favoring endocytosis at the trailing edge . Thus , a front - to - rear membrane tension could lead to net mem - brane transport to the leading edge which would accelerate cell movement . Further work is required to characterize the membrane - tension distribution in different motile cell types and to reveal its role under different conditions .
