Introduction Epithelia have important roles in shaping tissues and organs during embryogenesis , as well as in protecting tissues from homeostasis loss during wound healing [ 1 ] . Many physiological and pathological processes involve the ( re - ) sealing of epithelial gaps . From single cell apo - ptosis to macroscopic wound , discontinuities of the epi - thelial barrier occur continuously throughout the lifetime of organisms and in various scales and geometries . Our review hence focuses on how epithelium maintains its own integrity by examining diverse gap closure sce - narios . Such discontinuities can arise either intrinsically ( e . g . ventral closure and dorsal closure during develop - ment , cell extrusion during homeostasis maintenance ) or extrinsically ( e . g . physical and chemical injury , infection ) . Due to its physiological importance , a wide range of studies has strived to elucidate the mechanism of epithe - lial gap closure with both in vivo and in vitro techniques . Various morphogenetic events require the collective mi - gration of neighboring epithelium into an opening to form a continuous monolayer , including D . melanogaster dorsal closure , C . elegans ventral enclosure , eyelid closure , neural tube closure and trachea invagination [ 2 , 4 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 5 (cid:2) , 6 ] . In all these processes , an actin cable assembles apically to form a contractile ‘purse - string’ , and actin - based structures drive basal protrusion [ 7 – 10 ] . Lessons learnt from other gap closure processes studied in vitro , thanks to their striking similarities , helped understand the analysis of tissue morphogenesis in vivo [ 3 ] . Wound healing takes place during embryogenesis but also during adult life after a stress , for instance a skin cut , asthma or acute lung injury in the airway system . Inde - pendent of the tissue , healing processes share similarities [ 11 ] . However , due to its prevalence and tissue accessi - bility , epidermal wound healing has been the most stud - ied : a multi - step process including tissue growth and remodeling leading to the reconstruction of the wounded area [ 12 ] . In adult skin injuries , re - epithelization can last days , during which activated keratinocytes migrate col - lectively over the wound area , dragging their own basal lamina as they move forward [ 13 ] . Keratinocytes in the front remodel the underlying ECM by secreting proteo - litic enzymes such as metalloproteinases and depositing new ECM proteins [ 14 ] . Cell crawling seems to be more prominent here , with leader cells extending broad lamel - lipodia [ 15 – 17 ] . Interestingly , wound healing mecha - nisms vary with the age of the tissue . Much attention has been devoted to the study of embryonic wound healing due to its lack of scarring , reminiscent of gap closure events during morphogenesis , typically by a purse - string mechanism including rapid recruitment and assembly of actin and myosin into a thick cable in neighboring cells around the wound [ 18 – 20 ] . Finally , a particular case of epithelial gap closure is apoptotic cell extrusion , in which a dying cell is excluded from an epithelial monolayer . Cell extrusion also occurs recurrently in adulthood during tissue turnover and ho - meostatic processes [ 21 – 23 ] . When one or more cells undergo apoptosis , a purse - string mechanism triggers contraction that squeezes the apoptotic cell out of the epithelium . From the examples discussed above , it appears that two main mechanisms contribute to the restoration of the epithelial integrity : ( 1 ) acto - myosin cable contraction in a purse - string manner and ( 2 ) cell crawling driven by Available online at www . sciencedirect . com ScienceDirect Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2016 , 42 : 52 – 62 www . sciencedirect . com lamellipodial and / or ﬁlopodial protrusions . Sometimes one mechanism dominates but often the two are both present and not mutually exclusive , making it challenging to distinguish their individual contributions [ 24 , 25 (cid:2) ] ( Tables 1 and 2 ) . Fortunately , recent development of in vitro approaches allowed great progress in the under - standing of the relative and synergistic effects of the two mechanisms as well as their regulation , by means of applying mechanical and geometrical constraints [ 25 (cid:2) , 26 (cid:2) , 27 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 28 (cid:2) , 29 , 30 (cid:2) , 31 ] . The acto - myosin purse - string in epithelial gap closure The purse - string mechanism is deﬁned as the accumula - tion of actin and myosin II forming a contractile cable surrounding the rim of the gap [ 19 ] . It is involved in a large variety of situations related to epithelial gap closure . Single cell wounding is a critical event that must be quickly addressed to avoid leakage of intracellular com - ponents and subsequent cell death [ 32 ] . Cell repair by purse - string mechanism is conserved from embryonic to adult tissue cells of mammalian and non - mammalian origin [ 33 – 37 ] . As observed in wounded Xenopus oocyte , actin and myosin II accumulate at the injury site within the ﬁrst minute , and then progressively segregate to form two concentric rings surrounding the rim of the gap [ 33 , 38 ] . A repertoire of small GTPases Rho , Rac and Cdc42 localize circumferentially around the gap and actively regulate the reorganization of acto - myosin cyto - skeleton in a spatiotemporal manner [ 39 ] . During ﬂy early embryo cell repair , the acto - myosin ring colocalize with E - cadherin at the plasma membrane [ 20 ] . In this situa - tion , microtubules play an important role in organizing the acto - myosin ring [ 20 , 34 , 37 ] and in guiding vesicular transport to the injury site . For gap closure events involving multiple cells and there - fore epithelium healing , a supracellular purse - string has been reported to form in all cells at the wound border ( Figure 1Ia ) . In this case , acto - myosin accumulates at the wound margin , but junctional acto - myosin also participates in the healing process [ 40 ] . Acto - myosin ﬁbers are linked between neighboring cells , presumably through adherens and / or tight junctions [ 41 – 45 ] , such that the supracellular cables can build - up and maintain tension across several cells . In this way , the contraction of the acto - myosin cable can drive the collective movement of the wound edge cells into the void [ 45 ] ( Figure 1Ic ) . A complex spatiotemporal function of Rho GTPases signaling in controlling the closure has been reported [ 39 , 45 – 47 ] . Purse - string mechanism is mainly found in the closure of small monolayer defects during wound healing or cell extrusion [ 45 , 48 ] . The study of a pure purse - string mech - anism in vitro has been challenging since it requires preventing cell adhesion and matrix - based migration . However , recent studies have managed to implement in vitro models where epithelial gap closure can occur over non - adherent surfaces [ 49 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 50 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] ( Figure 1Ib ) . Here , the contraction of a multicellular actin cable is efﬁcient enough to close large - scale gaps , while the cells at the edge of the pattern are still attached to the ECM . Geo - metrical cues such as size and curvature of the gap matters , as well as intact intercellular junctions [ 28 (cid:2) , 49 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Interestingly , it appears that the maximal gap size that can be closed via purse - string differs among different cell types , such as keratinocytes and kidney epithelial cells , possibly due to differences in cytoskele - ton and intercellular adhesion associated mechanical properties [ 28 (cid:2) , 49 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 50 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . In the case of skin cells , force measurements revealed that they are ﬁrst exerting trac - tion forces on the substrate that point away from the gap . Once the cells have extended over the gap , as the contractile ‘purse - string’ cables form across the leading edge cells , the radial component of the force reverts direction with a maximal radial force of proximately 4 m N [ 48 ] . These cables contract rapidly , leading to the formation of a suspended cell sheet over the gap and complete closure of the wound . The ‘tug - of - war’ mechanism identiﬁed in this study provides a clear dem - onstration of how cells exert directional forces to facilitate epithelial gap closure . The role of cell crawling in epithelial gap closure The crawling mechanism requires the extension of a lamellipodium by leading edge cells , often switching from apico - basal polarity to front - rear polarity [ 51 ] ( Figure 1IIa and IIb ) . This process was initially described in monolayer wounding experiments using mechanical removal of a strip of cells , that is , manual scraping with pipette tip or razor blade [ 16 , 52 , 53 ] . Other studies per - formed with damage - free stencil removal and surface patterning techniques have shown that gap closure can in fact be triggered by the mere presence of free space [ 16 , 54 ] . The geometry and the size of these gaps can be easily varied with reproducibility [ 29 , 30 (cid:2) , 55 ] . First - row cells extend lamellipodia and crawl into the free space in a Rac1 - dependent manner [ 52 ] . However , cells positioned rows behind the leading edge also extend unusual lamel - lipodia , so called ‘cryptic’ , under the cell ahead [ 56 ] . Moreover , advanced image analysis showed that cells at back of the epithelial cell sheet are also motile [ 53 ] . Interestingly , when only the ﬁrst row of cells are sub - jected to a dominant negative form of Rac1 , closure proceeds normally as cells behind the leading edge , with normal levels of Rac1 activity , can jostle through the ﬁrst row of cells and become leader cells . Nevertheless , the closure is abrogated when the dominant negative form of Rac1 is expressed in the three ﬁrst rows of cells at the edge [ 52 ] . Therefore , although the role of leader cells remains crucial to locally orient and drive collective epithelial migration [ 57 , 58 ] , the closure is not necessarily Modes of epithelial gap closure Begnaud et al . 53 www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2016 , 42 : 52 – 62 54 C e ll d y n a m i c s Table 1 Purse string and crawling mechanisms are described separately .

Along this line , particle - based computational simulations relying on the migratory capacity of cells can describe in silico coordi - nated cell movements , as well as the appearance of leader cells at the boundary of cell monolayers [ 61 , 62 ] . In fact , these stimulations have shown that the cell crawling behavior is sufﬁcient to account for gap closure [ 63 ] .

A . www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2016 , 42 : 52 – 62 occurs due to the closure process , damage - induced factors can initiate the response through ERK signaling pathway , whereas under conditions without damage , cell crawling may be induced by the presence of free space and self - polarization alone [ 53 , 54 , 64 – 67 ] . Along this line , the role of front cells is also important in coordinating the polari - zation of a migrating tissue through their interactions with their physical environment and neighboring cells as re - cently reviewed in [ 68 ] . Coexistence and interplay between cell crawling and purse - string Cell crawling and purse - string are both important for closing epithelial gaps , and one can be favored over the other depending on the experimental conditions , including the presence of dead factors , gap size and geometry . Importantly , the two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive ( Table 2 ) . For instance , even though wound healing has been shown to mainly depend on purse - string in embryos , the presence of cellular protru - sions has also been reported , and both mechanisms are required for efﬁcient closure [ 3 , 10 , 69 ] ( Figure 2a , b ) . In - terestingly , the mode of closure appears to depend on the curvature of the wounded edge [ 25 (cid:2) ] . In vitro systems have provided a novel understanding of the physical and mechanical parameters involved in epi - thelial gap closure [ 25 (cid:2) , 26 (cid:2) , 27 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 70 (cid:2) ] . The coexistence of cell crawling and actin - based cable contractility has been reported to be crucial for promoting optimal wound closure . Moreover , in model wounds or scratches , the leading edge repolarizes and transforms into crawling cells , with the appearance of leader cells harboring a large forward lamellipodium [ 15 , 16 ] .

This cable is reminiscent of the one observed in purse - string process , and its formation also depends on RhoA activity [ 70 (cid:2) ] . Brugues et al . studied how actomyosin cables and actin - based protrusions generate mechanical forces during wound repair [ 27 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Cells adjacent to the wound generate radial traction forces pointing either away from the wound or into the wound . The inward pointing forces coincide with the position of protrusions , whereas outward point - ing forces coincide with the position of acto - myosin cables . Interestingly , the forces generated by the contrac - tion of the acto - myosin cable around the wound are also transmitted to the substrate . Cells transmit forces to the substrate through specialized structures known as focal adhesions ( FAs ) [ 71 , 72 ] . During epithelial gap closure , it appears that FA orientation is mostly parallel to the wound edge under the acto - myosin cable but perpendic - ular in cell protrusions [ 25 (cid:2) , 27 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . The shape of the wound , and in particular the direction of the local curvature of the gap , may be a key determinant of the modes of epithelia gap closure ( Figure 2d ) . Nega - tive curvature , that is , concave border , is related to actin cable assembly and purse - string - based closure , whereas positive curvature , that is , convex border , favors cell crawling [ 25 (cid:2) , 26 (cid:2) , 73 , 74 (cid:2) ] . A recent study explored the roles of two gap - closing mechanisms and described how the relative contributions of the two mechanisms are affected by gap geometry [ 25 (cid:2) ] . Cells predominantly crawl at positive curvature , whereas purse - string and crawling mechanisms additively operate to ﬁll the gap in areas of negative curvature , thus leading to faster tissue velocity ( Figure 2 ) . To summarize , these two mechanisms can act in concert to close gaps consisted of both concave and convex regions and their relative contribution depends on the local curvature . Conclusions and perspectives Purse - string and cell crawling mechanisms have been proposed to drive epithelial gap closure , but a clear picture of their respective functions is masked by the complexity of the closure process and the variety of conditions . However , recent in vitro and in vivo experi - ments have shown that physical constraints , such as local tissue curvature are crucial to the regulation of gap closure mechanisms [ 25 (cid:2) , 27 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 70 (cid:2) ] . Such coupling could be me - diated by a differential organization of the actin cortex depending on the shape of the cell membrane , but also by a differential distribution of curvature - sensing proteins , such as BAR domain proteins [ 75 ] . Interestingly , components of cell – cell adhesion , such as E - cadherin , are also dynamically redistributed at the wound edge , which could be mediated by contractile forces exerted by the acto - myosin cable [ 3 , 42 , 76 , 77 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Cadherin - based adhesions have been implicated in the transmission of intercellular , as well as in cell – substrate forces [ 78 , 79 , 80 (cid:2) , 81 ] , making them indispensable players in the mechanical regulation of multicellular gap closure . Finally , it would be of great interest to systematically characterize the closure of gaps , depending on the me - chanical properties of the surrounding environment , such as how the stiffness of the substrate may affect epithelial wound healing [ 82 , 83 ] . Aside from the passive mechanical properties of the ECM , other cells in the wound micro - environment can also actively provide mechanical cues to the epithelium . Recent works suggest that contraction of underlying cells drives Drosophila dorsal closure or Zebra - ﬁsh epiboly [ 84 ] . Similarly , myoﬁbroblasts in the dermis beneath an injured epidermis can contract and help the sealing of wounds [ 85 , 86 ] . Venturing into the realm between biology and physics should help us better understand the mechanics guiding epithelial gap closure . With the recent advances in in vitro techniques , we have the means to unveil more hidden mysteries in the process .
