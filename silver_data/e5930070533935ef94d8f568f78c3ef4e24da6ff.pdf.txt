PTPN22 is highly expressed in antigen presenting cells ( APCs ) where the expression of the murine dis - ease associated variant orthologue ( Ptpn22 R619W ) is reported to dysregulate pattern recog - nition receptor signalling in dendritic cells ( DCs ) and promote T - cell proliferation . Because T - cell activation is dependent on DC antigen uptake , degradation and presentation , we ana - lysed the efficiency of these functions in splenic and GM - CSF bone marrow derived DC from wild type ( WT ) , Ptpn22 - / - or Ptpn22 R619W mutant mice . Results indicated no differential ability of DCs to uptake antigen via macropinocytosis or receptor - mediated endocytosis . Antigen degradation and presentation was also equal as was WT T - cell conjugate formation and subsequent T - cell proliferation . Despite the likely presence of multiple phosphatase - regulated pathways in the antigen uptake , processing and presentation pathways that we investigated , we observed that Ptpn22 and the R619W autoimmune associated variant were dispensable . These important findings indicate that under non - inflammatory conditions there is no requirement for Ptpn22 in DC dependent antigen uptake and T - cell activation . Our findings reveal that perturbations in antigen uptake and processing , a fundamental pathway determining adaptive immune responses , are unlikely to provide a mechanism for the risk associated with the Ptpn22 autoimmune associated polymorphism .

Z ) and National Institutesof Health ( https : / / www . nih . gov ) : DP3 - Introduction The C1858T polymorphism within the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN22 ( encoding PTPN22 R620W ) is a major risk factor for the development of multiple autoimmune diseases , including rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , type I diabetes , lupus and juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) [ 1 ] . PTPN22 ( Ptpn22 in the mouse ) negatively regulates Src and Syk family kinase ( SFK ) activity downstream of the T - cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) [ 2 ] . As a result , T - cells from Ptpn22 - / - mice exhibit enhanced TCR signalling resulting in homeostatic expansion of CD4 + effector T - cells [ 3 ] . In addition to TCR signalling , PTPN22 regulates many pathways in different cell types including the B - cell receptor [ 4 ] , the α L β 2 integrin LFA - 1 [ 5 ] and Toll - Like Receptor ( TLR ) signalling pathways [ 6 – 9 ] . Furthermore , Ptpn22 also functions to alter SFK independent signalling events by modulating TRAF ubiquitination [ 8 ] . It has become widely accepted that the autoimmune associated PTPN22 R620W variant displays reduced binding to the tyrosine kinase Csk , due to a missense mutation in the P1 domain [ 2 , 10 ] , but precisely how the PTPN22 - R620W variant affects the functions of immune cell subsets is more complex . Both gain - and loss - of - phosphatase function effects have been reported , depending on the cellular context and signalling pathway under investigation [ 4 , 5 , 9 – 11 ] . Antigen presenting cells ( APCs ) are critical for pathogen sensing and antigen uptake to effectively clear infection . Ptpn22 is highly expressed in myeloid cells and a functional role for Ptpn22 in the regulation of multiple pattern recognition receptors has been established [ 6 , 8 , 9 ] . Antigen uptake occurs via non - specific pinocytosis or via receptor - mediated phago - cytosis , and is critical for APC mediated T - cell activation . Despite this , investigations assess - ing the capability of Ptpn22 to regulate antigen uptake and presentation are limited . A recent study reported that Ptpn22 R619W ( the murine orthologue of the human autoimmune associ - ated variant R620W ) expression in macrophages under non - inflammatory conditions increased wild type ( WT ) OT - II T - cell activation and proliferation . It was suggested that this was caused by an enhanced phagocytic capability of Ptpn22 R619W macrophages [ 12 ] . A fur - ther study documented that Ptpn22 R619W expressing BMDC matured with LPS also induce enhanced WT OT - II T - cell proliferation compared to WT controls , attributed to enhanced co - stimulation rather than phagocytosis [ 9 ] . Src and Syk family kinases regulate multiple pro - cesses that determine antigen uptake , processing and presentation , and ultimately , the capa - bility of APCs to activate T - cell responses [ 13 ] . For example , phosphorylation of Fc γ R and dectin - 1 associated ITAM motifs by SFKs regulates receptor - mediated phagocytosis [ 14 – 16 ] , whilst SFKs also mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin leading to cytoskeletal rear - rangement which facilitates engulfment of antigen [ 14 ] . Enhanced antigen phagocytosis and processing may , in addition , lead to enhanced T - cell activation , thus further contributing to the expansion of autoreactive T - cells in vivo [ 4 , 11 ] . We therefore sought to systematically assess the role of Ptpn22 in antigen phagocytosis and processing , and its impact on T - cell activation .

Results Ptpn22 does not impact antigen uptake via macropinocytosis Macropinocytosis occurs constitutively in APCs allowing for non - specific uptake of soluble molecules , nutrients and antigens [ 14 , 19 ] . Pinocytosis requires actin - dependent membrane ruffling , ultimately leading to MHC class I and MHC class II dependent antigen presentation to T - cells [ 19 – 21 ] . First , we assessed if Ptpn22 variants could regulate antigenic uptake via pinocytosis . To address this , we generated BMDC in the presence of GM - CSF from WT , Ptpn22 - / - and Ptpn22 R619W mice ; Ptpn22 expression was verified by genotyping and PCR ( Pan - els A and B in S1 Fig ) . No genotype specific differences were observed with respect to the pro - portion or number of CD11c + DC , ( or macrophage like CD11c + , CD11b Hi , I - A bInt cells ) generated within these cultures ( Panels A and B in S2 Fig ) [ 14 ] . Macropinocytosis was assessed by the capability of WT and Ptpn22 - / - BMDC to take up Lucifer yellow ( LY ) . WT and Ptpn22 - / - BMDC were incubated in the presence of LY at 37˚C for time points up to 30 minutes . As expected , the LY geometric mean fluorescent intensity ( GMFI ) signal increased over time ( Fig 1A ) , and internalisation of LY by WT , Ptpn22 R619W , and Ptpn22 - / - BMDC was comparable ( Fig 1A – 1C ) . Following TLR mediated maturation , macropinocytosis is decreased [ 14 , 21 , 22 ] . Accordingly , we assessed if the absence of Ptpn22 altered the capability of BMDC to downre - gulate LY uptake following LPS mediated maturation . We observed that , as previously reported [ 21 ] , BMDC pinocytosis was significantly reduced following LPS treatment ( Fig 1D ) , however WT and Ptpn22 - / - BMDC had an equal reduction in LY uptake ( Fig 1D and 1E ) . We therefore conclude that altered Ptpn22 function does not impact macropinocytosis . Ptpn22 does not influence mannose receptor - mediated antigen uptake Phagocytic cell surface receptors expressed on APCs mediate uptake of specific types of anti - gen through recognition of specific pattern associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) [ 23 ] . Receptor - mediated endocytosis is dependent on a number of processes including receptor clustering , modulation of specific signalling pathways by ubiquitination and kinase - induced phosphorylation , in addition to actin and cytoskeletal rearrangement [ 23 , 24 ] . We assessed the involvement of Ptpn22 in mannose receptor ( CD206 ) dependent phagocytosis of ovalbumin [ 24 ] , since ovalbumin provides an ideal model with which to assess the impact of altered phagocytosis on antigen specific OT - II T - cell activation . We confirmed that there was no dif - ference in cell surface expression of CD206 on immature WT versus Ptpn22 - / - BMDC ( Fig 2A and 2B ) and WT versus Ptpn22 R619W BMDC ( Panel A in S3 Fig ) . We next assessed if binding and uptake of ovalbumin conjugated to AF488 ( ovalbumin - AF488 ) was regulated by Ptpn22 . Wild type and Ptpn22 - / - BMDC were incubated with ovalbumin - AF488 at 37˚C for up to 60 minutes and the presence of AF488 within CD11c + cells determined . We observed over time that the proportion of AF488 + BMDC increased , but no differences were observed between the WT and Ptpn22 deficient BMDC ( Fig 2C ) , or between WT and Ptpn22 R619W BMDC ( Fig 2D ) at any time point .

Therefore we assessed if Ptpn22 regulates the uptake of antigens via other pattern recognition receptors , such as TLRs . Listeria monocytogenes is phagocytosed via TLR2 , and Candida albicans via dectin - 1 , both in a SFK dependent manner [ 26 ] . We observed no significant difference in the capability of WT or Ptpn22 - / - BMDCs to uptake heat killed L . monocytogenes ( Panel B in S3 Fig ) or heat killed C . albicans ( HKCA ) ( Panel C in S3 Fig ) . Together these data indicate that despite the presence of phosphatase dependent pathways , Ptpn22 does not impact antigen uptake via multiple phagocytic receptor pathways . Fig 2 .

Following 45 minutes at 37˚C there was an increase in the ovalbumin - AF647 GMFI of CD11c + MHC class II + splenic DCs ( Fig 3A ) .

Ptpn22 is dispensable for antigen processing and presentation Following antigen uptake , protein antigens are processed into peptides by lysosomal degrada - tion [ 27 ] . This process involves a complex series of events resulting in fusion of the phagocytic Fig 3 . Regulation of splenic DC receptormediated phagocytosis of ovalbumin occurs independently of Ptpn22 .

Perturbations of the lysosomal degradation pathway are associated with a variety of inflammatory and degenerative diseases [ 28 ] . To assess antigen processing , BMDCs were incubated with ovalbumin - AF594 coated beads for 0 – 5 hours at 37˚C . Internalised beads were identified by the absence of staining using rabbit anti - ovalbu - min . To determine antigen degradation , loss of ovalbumin fluorescence was assessed by flow cytometry .

However , the amount of degradation ( Fig 4A ) and the proportion of internalised beads with degraded ova ( Fig 4B ) were similar for WT and Ptpn22 - / - BMDC , indicating that Ptpn22 is dispensable for antigen processing . We next assessed whether Ptpn22 was required for loading of peptides onto MHC class II . WT and Ptpn22 - / - BMDC were incubated for 18 hours at 37˚C with a soluble fusion protein containing the E α peptide epitope , GFP - E α . Cell surface I - A b restricted presentation of E α peptide was determined by staining with anti - YAe - biotin ( specific for the E α 52 – 68 : IA b com - plex ) , followed by streptavidin - APC [ 30 ] . Although E α 52 – 68 : IA b was detected on more than 50 % of BMDC , the absence of Ptpn22 expression had no effect on the ability of BMDC to pres - ent E α peptides ( Fig 4C ) . In addition , cell surface expression of I - A b was similar between WT and Ptpn22 - / - BMDC [ 31 ] . Having established that antigen degradation and loading onto MHC class II were similar between WT and Ptpn22 - / - BMDC , we next assessed if Ptpn22 altered the formation of DC : T - cell conjugates . BMDC were activated overnight with LPS to upregulate cell surface MHC class II expression , pulsed with OVA 323 - 339 peptide , and labelled with CellTrace Far Red ( CTFR ) . CTFR labelled BMDC were then co - cultured with CellTrace Violet ( CTV ) labelled WT OT - II T - cells for up to 120 mins at 37˚C . The proportion of CTV + CTFR + cells increased over time , in keeping with the formation of DC : T - cell conjugates ( Fig 4D ) . However , we did not observe any difference in the capability of WT and Ptpn22 - / - BMDC to form conjugates ( Fig 4E ) , indicating that Ptpn22 is dispensable for DC : T - cell conjugate for - mation when Ptpn22 deficiency is confined to the DC . Together these data indicate that Ptpn22 does not regulate antigen phagocytosis , processing and presentation . Ptpn22 is redundant for dendritic cell activation of antigen specific T - cells It has previously been reported that Ptpn22 R619W BMDC are able to enhance antigen specific T - cell activation [ 9 , 12 ] . Given that we found no evidence that Ptpn22 regulated antigen phago - cytosis , processing and presentation , we next sought to assess if APC induced T - cell activation is indeed dependent on Ptpn22 . We compared the capability of WT and Ptpn22 - / - BMDC pulsed overnight with ovalbumin or OVA 323 - 339 peptide at concentrations between 0 . 01 – 1 μM in the absence of TLR stimulation . BMDC were harvested , washed and co - cultured with WT CTV labelled CD4 + OT - II for up to 6 days . We observed that increasing concentrations of ovalbumin or OVA 323 - 339 increased expression of T - cell early activation markers CD69 and CD25 ( Fig 5A and panel A in S4 Fig ) , with OVA 323 - 339 being more potent . WT and Ptpn22 - / - BMDC were equally capable of inducing the upregulation of both CD69 and CD25 regardless of peptide or protein concentration . Moreover , comparison of Ptpn22 R619W BMDC to WT controls did not reveal any differences in the capability to induce early T - cell activation ( Fig 5B and panel B in S4 Fig ) . IL - 2 is rapidly secreted by T - cells following T - cell activation . Although IL - 2 secretion increased , depending on the dose of ovalbumin peptide or protein , no differences between BMDC genotypes were observed ( Fig 5C and panel C in S4 Fig ) . In addi - tion we observed no Ptpn22 dependent difference in IFN γ secretion over the 6 days of co - cul - ture ( Fig 5D ) . Surprisingly , and contrary to previous reports [ 9 ] , no differences were observed in the capability of Ptpn22 variant DC to induce WT T - cell proliferation at multiple peptide or protein concentrations when compared to WT BMDC ( Fig 5E and panels D and E in S4 Fig ) or when BMDC were matured in the presence of LPS ( Panel F in S4 Fig ) . This is in contrast to the enhanced T - cell proliferation observed when Ptpn22 variants are expressed in the T - cell compartment [ 17 , 32 ] . Finally , we sought to address if Ptpn22 was dispensable for APC mediated activation of T - cells in vivo . To address this , CTV labelled WT CD4 + CD45 . 1 + OT - II T - cells were adoptively transferred into CD45 . 2 + WT or Ptpn22 - / - mice and immunised with ovalbumin .

Together these data demonstrate that Ptpn22 and the autoimmune associated Ptpn22 R619W variant does not impact the uptake , pro - cessing , and presentation of antigen by DCs , and that under non - inflammatory conditions the resultant T - cell priming is unaltered . Discussion PTPN22 R620W is associated with an enhanced risk of developing multiple autoimmune diseases and , as such , has prompted investigations into which cells and pathways may be perturbed by carrying the polymorphism , thereby promoting autoimmunity . Adaptive immune responses are critical to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases associated with the PTPN22 R620W poly - morphism . Furthermore , SFK dependent pathways regulate antigen processing and presenta - tion in dendritic cells . Here we took a systematic approach to assess if Ptpn22 variants are capable of regulating APC antigen uptake , processing , presentation and APC - driven T - cell activation under non - inflammatory conditions . Unexpectedly , we observed that Ptpn22 and the autoimmune associated variant are dispensable for each of these processes both in vitro and in vivo . Despite antigen uptake requiring a balance of SFK dependent phosphorylation and phos - phatase - regulated dephosphorylation , our data indicate that Ptpn22 is dispensable in this pro - cess . In contrast to a previous report observing enhanced uptake of E . coli by Ptpn22 R619W macrophages [ 14 ] , we observed no differences in receptor - mediated antigen uptake by den - dritic cells across a range of receptor pathways . The cause of this discrepancy may reflect dif - ferences in cell - mediated uptake in macrophages versus dendritic cells , or may reflect differences in mouse health status / microbiota , or may indicate that Ptpn22 specifically regu - lates E . coli dependent uptake rather than broadly regulating receptor - mediated endocytosis pathways . Overall , our combined data strongly support the conclusion that alternative phos - phatases are likely to operate as primary , or redundant regulators of antigen processing path - ways . Indeed , phosphatases including SHIP - 1 , SHP - 1 , and CD45 have all been observed to regulate processes required for antigen uptake and processing [ 15 , 33 , 34 ] . Again contrary to previous reports [ 9 , 12 ] , we observed no difference in the capability of Ptpn22 deficient or Ptpn22 R619W BMDC or splenic DC versus the equivalent WT - derived pop - ulations to induce WT OT - II T - cell proliferation . The reason for this observed discrepancy in T - cell activation compared with previous studies is unclear . It may be due to subtle differences in the thresholds for signalling dependent on the dosing concentrations of BMDC stimuli , the age of animals studied or the possibility that previous work utilised cells from animals with active inflammatory changes . Most strikingly , and consistent with the interpretation that Ptpn22 has little impact on APC function in a physiological setting , our in vivo data demon - strated equivalent activation of WT OT - II CD4 + T - cells following adoptive transfer into Ptpn22 deficient or WT control mice ( Fig 5G and 5H ) . As we , and others , have previously reported , Ptpn22 R619W mice exhibit increased responses to ova immunisation and marked changes in T - cell activation [ 4 , 17 , 35 ] . Thus , although our data revealed no difference in conju - gate formation between WT and Ptpn22 variant DC with WT T - cells , Ptpn22 is likely to mod - ulate MHC class II restricted DC : T - cell conjugate formation in a T - cell dependent manner ( rather than through effects on the DC ) . Consistent with this idea , Ptpn22 deficient CD8 + OT - I T - cells have an enhanced capability to form conjugates with WT APCs in response to low affinity peptide antigen , leading to enhanced T - cell activation in an LFA - 1 dependent manner [ 5 , 32 ] . PTPN22 is dispensable for dendriticcell antigenprocessing PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0186625 October 17 , 2017 13 / 17 In conclusion we show that Ptpn22 deficiency or the expression of the autoimmune associ - ated variant of Ptpn22 does not regulate the phagocytic capability of in vitro generated BMDC or splenic DCs . Furthermore , as systematically demonstrated here , using a broad range of models , Ptpn22 is redundant for the processing and presentation of protein antigen and that Ptpn22 variant DC were not altered in their capability to induce T - cell activation under non - inflammatory conditions either in vitro or in vivo . Antigen uptake , processing and presenta - tion are fundamental to the induction of adaptive T - cell responses . Our data reveal that pertur - bations caused by the autoimmune associated risk variant of Ptpn22 are unlikely to promote autoimmunity via these pathways in DC . Supporting information S1 Fig .
