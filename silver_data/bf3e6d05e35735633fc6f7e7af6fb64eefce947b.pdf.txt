COMPUTATIONAL MECHANOBIOLOGY OF FILAMENTOUS PROTEINS : ALPHA - HELICAL COILED COILS AND F - ACTIN by Osman N . Yogurtcu A dissertation submitted to The Johns Hopkins University in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy . Baltimore , Maryland October , 2013 c (cid:13) Osman N . Yogurtcu 2013 All rights reserved Abstract This dissertation sits at the intersection of mechanics and biology . Speciﬁcally , we devise mesoscopic mechanochemical models to study bioﬁlaments , very ubiquitous cellular protein structures . Since they undergo functional bending , twisting , buck - ling and stretching motions , understanding the mechanical response of bioﬁlaments is crucial for a correct description of the conformational states of these proteins . Our models contribute to the better understanding of the nonlinearities in the mechani - cal response of bioﬁlaments to the environmental perturbations , without resorting to computationally costly full atomistic simulations . Two important ﬁlamentous struc - tures coiled - coil and actin make up the main concentration of our work . Coiled coils are a rope - like protein motif formed by two or more alpha helices . The energetic of a coiled coil involves a competition between elastic deformation and hydrophobic inter - action of residues of each helix . The model treats alpha helices as elastic rods where each rod interacts with another exclusively through beads representing the hydropho - bic residues . We validate our model using steered molecular dynamics simulations and compare it with continuum thin rod model . We analyze the bending , buckling ii and twisting behavior of coiled coil molecules of various lengths and conclude that a coiled coil molecule cannot be fully characterized by a simple single - parameter me - chanical model . The second ﬁlamentous biological structure we study is ﬁlamentous actin , F - actin , which is an important player in eukaryotic cellular processes including motility , morphogenesis , and mechanosensation . Actin monomer , G - actin , polymer - izes to form F - actin . G - actin is an ATP hydrolase and at any time it is bound to either an ATP or ADP molecule . Mechanical and chemical properties of actin ﬁl - aments are strongly coupled to each other through the bound nucleotide type . In our model of F - actin , each monomer is treated as a spherical particle with a bound molecule identity . The particles are connected by a set of springs with changing me - chanical properties that depend on the bound molecule . Using this model , we study and explain the behavior of actin ﬁlaments under various external mechanical stimuli introduced by actin binding proteins . Finally , we discuss the coupling of monomer chemical state changes to the global mechanical response of actin . Dissertation Advisor : Dr . Sean X . Sun Dissertation Readers : Professor , Dr .

Flight of a bird , walking of a cock - roach , swimming of a whale , forces generated by a muscle ﬁber , crawling of a cell and mechanical responses of biomolecules are all systems that can be analyzed using mechanics . For humans at the organ level , mechanical homeostasis is necessary to an individual’s survival . Bones , muscles , lungs , vasculature and heart are mechanosen - 1 sitive organs . For example , an astronaut loses about 1 % of his / her bone mass per month in a space mission due to disuse osteoporosis [ 1 ] . A simple calculation yields a 50 % bone mass loss in a 5 - year - long space mission ! How the mechanical homeosta - sis is maintained in organs and tissues through cellular machinery is an active ﬁeld of research . One such exemplary machinery that is found to sense and respond to environmental mechanical signals is focal adhesion complex [ 2 ] . On a focal adhesion complex , forces from the extracellular matrix are sensed and converted into chemical signals through G - proteins and this alters the behavior of the force generating mod - ules of the cell and a mechanical response is produced [ 3 ] . Mechanics play a role in the cellular diﬀerentiation as well . Recent studies have shown that the diﬀerentiation fate of a stem cell is determined by the mechanical properties of the environment that it is planted in [ 4 , 5 ] . Also , it is generally accepted that tumor cells are stiﬀer than their environment and this is used to detect cancerous cells in a tissue [ 6 , 7 ] . The examples laid out above is an excellent source of motivation to better under - stand the eﬀects of mechanics in biological systems , as this would potentially have a big impact on medicine and techonology . This dissertation aims at pushing the bound - aries of knowledge on nonlinear mechanical behavior of ﬁlamentous biomolecules . 2 1 . 2 Bioﬁlaments Filamentous biomolecules are very common in nature and they undertake a great variety of important roles . In muscle contraction and regulation , the basic elements of a sarcomere , titin , myosin , actin , tropomyosin are ﬁlamentous molecules . Also , bacterial ﬂagella and chemoreceptor , which are crucial to the survival of bacteria , are simply bioﬁlaments . Bioﬁlaments are important in reproduction as well . Tail of sperm cells are made of microtubules . In addition , the auditory and olfactory systems make use of bioﬁlaments . Ear stereocilia contain actin ﬁlaments . Bioﬁlaments also take roles in structural integrity of organs . Collagen , keratin and elastin are ﬁlamentous molecules . Finally , DNA is a bioﬁlament . All these bioﬁlaments are under constant interaction with their environment and understanding their response to mechanical signals is important . Bioﬁlaments are of mainly two origins , nucleic acid and amino acid . The remainder of this chapter will be devoted to bioﬁlaments of amino acid origin in line with the focus of our current work . 1 . 2 . 1 Protein - based ﬁlaments Amino acids are organic compunds which carry both an amine ( NH 2 ) and a car - boxylic acid ( COOH ) group . The characteristics of an amino acid is decided by its R side - chain group . Based on their R group , amino acids can be classiﬁed into being hy - 3 drophobic , hydrophillic , negatively or positively charged . Alanine , leucine , ileucine , valine , tyrosine , phenylalanine and tryptophane are hydrophobic amino acids . A pro - tein is a polymer chain whose monomers are amino acids . Covalent bonds formed between each amino acid is called a peptide bond ( Fig . 1 . 1A ) . A residue is deﬁned as an amino acid in a polypeptide chain . Non - neighboring residues interact through intermolecular forces . These are weaker forces in comparison to the covalent bonds . Intermolecular forces in a protein come from ionic ( ∼ 0 . 2 - 10kT ) , hydrogen bond ( ∼ 1 - 5kT ) , hydrophobic ( ∼ 1 - 5kT ) and van der Waals interactions ( ∼ 1 - 2kT ) [ 8 ] . To com - pare , the energy of a single ATP hydrolysis releases 20kT [ 8 ] . All these mentioned chemical interactions give a protein its native conformation . Predicting the ﬁnal con - formation of a protein by looking at its amino acid sequence is extremely diﬃcult . This is called the protein folding problem . Alpha helix is one of the most common substructures of a protein . Formation of alpha helices is done solely through hydrogen bonding between the i th and i + 4 th residues . This repetitive fashion of interactions results in a well deﬁned right - handed helical geometry ( see Fig . 1 . 1B ) with a typical radius of 0 . 23 nm . Each amino acid on an alpha helix contributes to an axial rise of about 0 . 15 nm . This rise corresponds to about 100 ◦ rotation along the helical axis . Hence , it takes almost 3 . 6 residues to complete a full circle ( 360 ◦ ) . As a result , when a full circle is complete , the total rise along the helical axis is about 0 . 54 nm . This is description of the pitch of an alpha helix . Mechanical properties of alpha helices are known . 4 A B C D P = 0 . 54 nm ~ 14 n m Figure 1 . 1 : Alpha helix , coiled coil and F - actin .

( C ) Cortexillin is a typical coiled coil dimer ( PDBID : 1D7M ) . Shown alongside is a representation of the heptad repeat . ( D ) Adapted from [ 9 ] . F - actin is a polar ﬁlament of helical pitch 72 nm . Polymerization happens preferably at the barbed ( + ) end and depolymerization preferably at the pointed ( - ) end . 5 1 . 2 . 2 Coiled Coil The hydrophobic interactions of two or more alpha helices give rise to a helical coiled coil structure . These hydrophobic interactions are in general follow a seven - unit repeat pattern called a heptad repeat ( Fig . 1 . 1C ) . In this repeat unit residues on a single helix are labeled “abcdefg” . In a heptad repeat unit , positions a and d are hydrophobic residues . The ionic interactions between e and g residues of opposite helices provide sequence speciﬁcity to a coiled coil [ 10 ] . A coiled coil dimer has a diameter of about 2 nm [ 11 ] and pitch of 14 nm [ 12 ] . Alpha helical coiled coil motif is present in many functionally important proteins . In exocytosis , SNARE proteins provide necessary forces to perturb lipid bilayer mem - brane for cargo transport . Using a similar strategy , gp41 coiled coil protein leads HIV viral entry into a healthy cell . Myosin II and V have coiled coil arms . Leucine zipper , a coiled coil dimer , regulates gene expression by binding speciﬁc regions of DNA . In addition , recently , coiled coil structures have attracted a great interest in appli - cations in material science due to their simple and easily controllable self - assembly properties [ 13 , 14 ] . 1 . 2 . 3 Actin G - actin is a globular protein of an approximate radius of 6 nm and is composed of 374 residues . F - actin can be viewed as a helical polymer of G - actin monomers . Pitch 6 of F - actin is 72 nm and the ﬁlament diameter is about 8 nm . A cartoon representation is provided in Fig . 1 . 1D . G - actin is an ATP hydrolase . Both in the monomeric and in polymerized F - actin form it carries a nucleotide ( ATP or ADP ) . Polymerization kinetics of G - actin - ATP and G - actin - ADP is diﬀerent . Polymerization of G - actin - ATP is favored over G - actin - ADP . Polymerization depends on not only the chemical state of the monomer , but also at which end the binding happens [ 15 ] . The two ends of F - actin are named as pointed end ( - ) and the barbed end ( + ) . The fact that the polymerization on the pointed end is much slower than the barbed end renders F - actin a polar ﬁlament . With more than 100 binding partners , actin is a very central protein in a eukaryotic cell . We see actin as the thin ﬁlament in muscle sarcomere . Actin is also a key constituent of the contractile ring during cell cytokinesis . Myosin walks along actin tracks to transport cargo within a cell . Finally , as a cytoskeletal protein actin provides support to a cell and is involved in cell motility through lamellipodia and ﬁlipodia . 1 . 2 . 4 Modeling in Mechanobiology As the main focus of this thesis is bioﬁlaments , let us now turn to modelling of bioﬁlaments . An obvious observation about ﬁlamentous structures is their high aspect ratios . Therefore , the simplest mathematical representation that could be used to describe the geometry of a ﬁlament is a plane curve . While this description is reasonable from a macroscopic perspective , a helix equation may be a more natural 7 representation as most of the bioﬁlaments are in helical conformation . A right - handed helix h ( q ) of height pQ2 π and radius r can be written as a parametric equation of q as follows : h ( q ) → ( r cos ( q ) , r sin ( q ) , p 2 π q ) , q (cid:15) [ 0 , Q ] ( 1 . 1 ) In Equation 1 . 1 , p is the pitch of the helix . The pitch can be deﬁned as the distance of translation performed by the helix along the helical axis , when it is rotated by 2 π along the axis ( see Fig . 1 . 1B ) . Bioﬁlaments are under constant external perturbations such as bending , twisting and stretching . Mathematical description of such deformations is needed . For this we get help from the diﬀerential geometry of curves . Let us start by ﬁnding the arc length of the example helix of Equation 1 . 1 . The arc length L of helix h ( q ) is found by the following integration L = Q (cid:90) 0 dq (cid:115)(cid:18) ∂ x ∂ q (cid:19) 2 + (cid:18) ∂ y ∂ q (cid:19) 2 + (cid:18) ∂ z ∂ q (cid:19) 2 We can write the above equation in terms of the tangent vector to the curve L = Q (cid:90) 0 dq (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) dh dq (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) The arc length L of the example helix is then L = Q (cid:90) 0 dq (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) ( − r sin ( q ) , r cos ( q ) , p 2 π ) (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) = Q (cid:114) r 2 + (cid:16) p 2 π (cid:17) 2 The parameterization of our curve is arbitrary . We can re - parameterize our helix using the arc length argument s using the following relation and replacing q in Equation 8 1 . 1 with s : s = q (cid:90) 0 dq (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) dh dq (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) = q (cid:114) r 2 + (cid:16) p 2 π (cid:17) 2 h ( s ) = ( r cos   s (cid:113) r 2 + (cid:0) p2 π (cid:1) 2   , r sin   s (cid:113) r 2 + (cid:0) p2 π (cid:1) 2   , ps 2 π (cid:113) r 2 + (cid:0) p2 π (cid:1) 2 ) Bending of a curve is expressed by curvature . In other words , curvature measures the amount of change in the direction of the vector tangent to the curve . In our helix example the tangent vector t can be written as a function of s . t ( s ) = dh ds We note here that t ( s ) is a unit vector . The amount of changes in the tangent vector is found by diﬀerentiation with respect to arc length parameter s . This gives us the curvature vector κ ( s ) : κ ( s ) = dt ds The curvature is deﬁned as the magnitude of κ ( s ) . The radius of curvature is the radius of the best - ﬁtting circle around the curve at position s and it is written as the reciprocal of κ ( s ) . For the helix example , the curvature is equal to : r r 2 + (cid:0) p2 π (cid:1) 2 The unit normal vector n to the curve can be derived from the tangent vector as follows : n ( s ) = 1 (cid:107) κ (cid:107) dκ ds 9 By using diﬀerentiation of the dot product rule , it can be shown that the two vectors κ ( s ) and n ( s ) are orthogonal to each other . In R 3 , if we have two orthonormal vectors , we can deﬁne a new vector that is orthogonal to both constituent vectors . In our case , the third orthonormal vector is called the binormal vector ( b ) : b = t × n Similar to the tangent vector , the variations in the binormal vector with respect to the arc length is a measure of twist of the curve . This measure is called torsion τ ( s ) and deﬁned as : τ = − n · db ds Sign of the torsion tells us if a helix is right or left - handed . If torsion is positive , then the helix is right - handed . For the helix example , the torsion is equal to : τ = p2 π r 2 + (cid:0) p2 π (cid:1) 2 Curvature and torsion is necessary and suﬃcient to describe the geometry of a curve and the local deformations . The vectors t , n and b form a body attached orthonormal frame called Frenet frame , F { t , n , b } . Evolution of F { t , n , b } is given by the solution to the Frenet - Serret equations :   dtds dnds dbds   =   0 κ ( s ) 0 − κ ( s ) 0 τ ( s ) 0 − τ ( s ) 0     t n b   10 F ( s ) = Ω F ( 0 ) = exp   0 κ ( s ) 0 − κ ( s ) 0 τ ( s ) 0 − τ ( s ) 0   F ( 0 ) where F ( 0 ) is the Frenet frame at s = 0 . We note that the Ω is a skew - symmetric matrix and its exponentiation yields an orthogonal matrix . Also , when deﬁning our F ( s ) , one would observe that the choice of vectors n and b is arbitrary so long t is the tangent vector . However , the particular choice of F { t , n , b } results in the least number of deformation constants ( in this case 2 , curvature and torsion ) . Any other choice would yield in 3 deformation constants and these are called the generalized curvatures ( ω 1 , ω 2 , ω 3 ) . To make a proper mechanical description of bioﬁlaments , we need relevant ma - terial properties , namely elastic moduli . Using these data , bioﬁlaments are modeled assuming they obey linear elasticity . Based on the previously described generalized curvatures and stretching we can write the total elastic energy stored on a single ﬁlament as follows : E f = 1 2 l (cid:90) 0 ds (cid:34) C √ g ( √ g − 1 ) 2 + 3 (cid:88) i = 1 A i ( ω i − Ω i ) 2 (cid:35) ( 1 . 2 ) where A i are generalized rigidities , C stretch modulus , Ω i are preferred curvatures and g is a stretch metric deﬁned as g = (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) ∂ r ( s ) ∂ s 0 (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) 2 where s 0 is the relaxed arc length parameter . For a system of multiﬁlaments and 11 applied external work , the total energy can be written : E t = n (cid:88) i = 1 E if + E int + W ext ( 1 . 3 ) where E int is the total ﬁlament interaction energy and W ext stands for the external work term . In order to arrive at the ﬁnal conformations ( the set of ω i ( s ) ) , we ﬁrst discretize the geometry . Then , we minimize the total energy E t . One observation about the total energy is that the majority of the terms in the discrete summation ( except work and interaction terms ) is squared . Therefore , presumably the most con - venient optimization algorithm for this problem is nonlinear least squares ﬁtting . We note that spatial discretization is not the only method to solve for the ﬁnal confor - mations . Equation 1 . 3 is an energy functional of generalized curvatures and stretch metric . Using principles from variational calculus this energy can be minimized . The resulting curvatures and stretch metric functions are solutions of force and moment balance equations [ 16 , 17 ] . Also , one could generalize elastic ﬁlament energy equation ( Eq . 1 . 2 ) to situations where coupling of stiﬀness in all angular and translational variables considered [ 18 , 19 ] . We need to emphasize that there is a critical force for any bioﬁlament beyond which rupture occurs . During simulations these forces should be taken into account . It was experimentally observed that it takes about 15 pN to start unzipping a coiled coil dimer [ 20 ] , although there is some pulling rate dependence . The rupture force for F - actin is about 600 pN [ 21 ] . For our stochastic simulations in this work we used the Gillespie algorithm . This 12 algorithm gives us trajectories that are good representatives of a studied stochastic system [ 22 ] . The Gillespie algorithm mainly consists of two steps . These steps are repeated until the desired probability sampling is obtained . Let’s assume N neigh - boring states . In the ﬁrst step , the possible neighboring states are discovered and the rates k i from the current state to the neighboring states are calculated , where i runs from 1 to N . Once this is done , in the second step , using the rates , τ i the escape time from the current state is calculated and the new destination state is decided . The net escape time from the current state is sampled from an exponential distribution as follows : τ i = − log r 1 (cid:80) i k i ( 1 . 4 ) where r 1 is a uniform random variable in the interval 0 and 1 . For the decision of the next state , ﬁrst a uniform random number r 2 is picked from the interval 0 and 1 . Then , a grid of probabilities is formed by stacking the following normalized rates from 0 to 1 : P i = k i (cid:80) i k i Finally , the new state is decided based on where r 2 falls onto in this grid . The basic idea is that the states with higher P i will have a higher likelihood of being chosen as the new destination state . Let us brieﬂy walk through the pictorial example shown in Fig . 1 . 2 . Starting from S0 , there is only 3 possible escape states . Assume the algorithm picked S12 as the new state , presumably because k12 is bigger than k11 and k13 . Then , at state S12 we have 4 possible destination states ( S0 , S24 , S25 and 13 S0 S11 S12 S13 S21 S22 S23 S24 S25 S26 S27 S28 S29 k11 k12 k13 k21 k22 k23 k24 k25 k26 k27 k28 k29 Figure 1 . 2 : Pictorial description of a simple example Gillespie stochastic simulation . System starts at state S0 . The stochastic trajectory of the system depends on the assigned rates . The net escape time from a state is picked from an exponential distribution deﬁned by the relevant rates as discussed in the text . 14 S26 ) . The following state should be chosen among these states according to their respective escape rates . In this simple setting , we did not make a diﬀerentiation between the forward and backward rates . When running Gillespie simulations , one should make sure that the system obeys detailed balance ( reversibility ) . This is done by imposing the following condition on forward ( k 1 ) and backward ( k 2 ) rates : k 1 k 2 = exp ( − β (cid:52) F ) where (cid:52) F = F 1 − F 2 is the free energy diﬀerence between forward state 1 and back - ward state 2 and β = ( k b T ) − 1 . k b is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature . The organization of the rest of this thesis is as follows . On chapter 2 , we ﬁrst describe our coiled coil model and discuss our results . Then , on Chapter 3 , we move on to our mechanochemical model of actin . Finally , we make a general summary of this work and lay out some possible future directions . 15 Chapter 2 Mechanical Response and Conformational Ampliﬁcation in α - helical coiled coils α - helical coiled coils are ubiquitous tertiary structural domains often found in mechanoproteins . Coiled coils have mechanical rigidity , and are often involved in force transmission between protein domains . While crystal structures of the coiled coil are available , limited information exists on its conformational ﬂexibility . The role of hydrophobic interactions in determining the coiled coil conformation is not clear . In this work , we examine the mechanical responses of typical coiled coils , and build a coarse - grained mechanical model to describe the conformation of the protein . The model treats α - helices as elastic rods . Hydrophobic bonds arranged in a repeated 16 pattern determine the coiled coil structure . The model is compared to molecular dy - namics simulations of coiled coils under force . We also estimate the eﬀective bending and twisting persistence lengths of the coiled coil . The model allows us to examine unconventional responses of the coiled coil , including signiﬁcant conformational am - pliﬁcation upon the binding of a small molecule . We ﬁnd that the coiled coil does not behave as a simple elastic rod and shows complex nonlinear responses . These results are signiﬁcant for understanding the role of coiled coil structures in chemoreceptors , motor proteins and mechanotransduction in general . 2 . 1 Introduction Alpha - helical coiled coils ( CC ) are a common rope - like protein motif found in gene regulation [ 23 ] , muscle contraction [ 24 ] , molecular motors and cell signalling [ 25 ] . The number of unique CC structures identiﬁed in the Protein Data Bank is currently 941 [ 26 ] . How these ubiquitous protein motifs mechanistically contribute to diverse biological functions is not clear . In this work , we explore the conformational ﬂexibility of the CC and develop a coarse - grained mechanical model to explain its response to external perturbations . The model captures the essential features of CC mechanics . We ﬁnd that the CC does not behave as a simple rod - like structure . In some cases , dramatic ampliﬁcation of local conformational changes are observed . The complex response to external loads may explain the roles of CC motifs in a variety of proteins 17 found in the cell . The basic CC structure is a homodimer where residues in each α - helix contain a se - quence pattern called the heptad repeat , typically denoted alphabetically as abcdefg . a and d are the hydrophobic residues which form the hydrophobic core that binds the helices together . Because there are 3 . 64 residues per turn in the α - helix , a and d residues form a helical arrangement on the surface of the α - helix . In order to main - tain hydrophobic contact in the CC , the α - helices must twist and bend around each other ( Fig . 2 . 1 ) in a fashion that Crick ﬁrst described as Knobs - into - Holes ( KiH ) [ 27 ] . Other interhelical interactions are also important : e - and g - type residue interactions provide speciﬁcity to the structure [ 10 ] , although they are generally weaker than a - a and d - d type interactions . Interhelical residue interactions are also the basis of larger and more complex α - helical bundles such as the recently found heptameric struc - ture [ 28 ] . Therefore , mechanistic understanding of these α - helical bundles require quantitative models of residue side - chain interactions . An important structural aspect of the CC that is experimentally observable is its pitch . Due to residue sequence irregularities , it is sometimes necessary to deﬁne local and global pitch values . The pitch of perfect CC homodimers is 12 - 14 nm . For trimeric or tetrameric structures , the upper limit of the pitch value becomes closer to 20nm [ 29 , 30 ] . Several studies also have discussed how the pitch is related to α - helix properties based on geometric arguments [ 11 , 31 ] . Recently , Wolgemuth and Sun ( WS ) developed a model to relate the CC pitch to the mechanical properties of the 18 α - helix and the geometric pattern of hydrophobic residues [ 16 ] . The model assumed a continuous interaction between helices and treated the hydrophobic interactions as a constraint . WS showed that the CC under small deformation is rod - like , and bend - ing and twisting stiﬀness of the CC can be estimated starting from the properties of the α - helices . The mechanical model opens the possibility of understanding confor - mational properties of the CC and how the CC responds to external forces . Several studies along these lines have appeared [ 32 ] . Using Normal Mode Analysis ( NMA ) and molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations , bending and stretching stiﬀness and un - folding of a CC have been studied [ 33 , 34 ] . From NMA and MD data , Lakkaraju and Hwang [ 35 ] recently suggested that conformations of longer CCs ( > 70nm ) could be inﬂuenced by a critical buckling length longer than the persistence length . CC conformational studies have also suggested that CCs have the allosteric potential and they could be used as nanoswitches [ 36 , 37 ] . Additional conformational changes in the CCs such as sliding of an individual helix with respect to another was shown to have biological relevance [ 38 , 39 ] . In this work , we propose a simple scalable coarse - grained model for the CC and α - helical bundles . Speciﬁcally , we introduce a discrete inter - action potential to model the hydrophobic contact between a - and d - type residues . We use this model to predict the mechanical response of a dimeric CC under force and compare with molecular dynamics simulation results and thin rod theory [ 40 ] . We ﬁnd that the hydrophobic contacts provide both distance and angular constraints between the helices in CC .

( a ) Tropomyosin is a prototypical CC . Here , the crystal structure ( PDBID : 2tma ) is displayed . ( b ) A section of the coiled coil , red and yellow beads representing a - and d - type residue C α ’s respectively ( c ) The coiled coil model represents each α - helix as a slender rod described by the rod position and local material frames ( e 1 ( s ) , e 2 ( s ) , e 3 ( s ) ) ( Eq . 2 . 1 ) . The locations of the hydrophobic residues are uniquely deﬁned with respect to these parameters . ( d ) The interaction between hydrophobic residues is deﬁned by the vector between the residues , d , and the vector between the helix centers , R as shown in Eq . 2 . 14 . For detailed deﬁnitions , see Models . 20 the CC can be described by a rod . However , depending on how the forces are ap - plied , complex mechanical response is seen . In some cases , small local conformational changes in the CC is ampliﬁed by many fold over long distances . These responses can have important implications in the biological functions of the CC . The structure of this chapter is as follows : In the Results section we show the eﬀects of parame - ter choices on the model and the response of the model CC under diﬀerent external forces , then we discuss these results in Discussion and ﬁnally we provide a detailed description of our model in Models . 2 . 2 Models 2 . 2 . 1 Coiled Coil Kinematics The elements of the CC model are depicted in Fig . 2 . 1C and 1D . Each α - helix is represented by a slender rod whose centerline is denoted as r ( s ) where s is the unstretched arclength along the helix . For points along the helix , a material frame ( e 1 ( s ) , e 2 ( s ) , e 3 ( s ) ) also describes the local orientation of the residues . This material frame satisﬁes the Frenet equations : ∂ e i ∂s = − (cid:88) j , k (cid:15) ijk e j ω k ( 2 . 1 ) where (cid:15) ijk is the antisymmetric tensor ; ω 1 , 2 are the rates of torsion and ω 3 ( s ) is the rate of twist for the α - helix . With these parameters ( r ( s ) , ω 1 ( s ) , ω 2 ( s ) , ω 3 ( s ) ) , 21 the unstretched conﬁguration of the helix is completely deﬁned . In particular , the positions of all residues can be written with respect to these quantities . We deﬁne the position of the CA atom in the m - th residue as h m = r ( s m ) + r 0 e 2 ( s m ) ( 2 . 2 ) where s m is the arc - length position of the m - th residue . In the unstretched helix , the helix rise per residue is 0 . 15nm , therefore s m − s m − 1 = 0 . 15 and the arclength distance between neighboring a - residues is 1 . 05nm ; the radius r 0 is taken to be 0 . 23 nm . Because the residues form a helical pattern in the α - helix and the helix is intrin - sically straight if there are no other inﬂuences , for an isolated helix , the instrinsic torsion and twist of the Frenet frame is deﬁned as Ω 1 = Ω 2 = 0 Ω 3 = − π + mod ( αp + π , 2 π ) ph 0 ( 2 . 3 ) where h 0 = 0 . 15nm is the helical rise per residue along the centerline , p is the hy - drophobic periodicity , and α is the angle between each residue . In addition to the residue positions , it is also necessary to deﬁne the parameters specifying the hydrophobic bonds . The bond vector between m - th hydrophobic pair is d m = h m − h (cid:48) m ( 2 . 4 ) where the prime denotes the complimentary second helix in the CC and h (cid:48) m = r (cid:48) ( s (cid:48) m ) + 22 Parameter Symbol Value Intrinsic α - helical twist † Ω 3 - 0 . 6 nm − 1 Intrinsic α - helical bending torsion Ω 1 , 2 0 . 0 Helical rise per residue h 0 0 . 15 nm Hydrophobic periodicity p 7 Angle between residues α 97 . 7 ◦ Helix bending persistence length l p 90 nm Helix twist persistence length l t 45 nm Helix stretching modulus C 3600 pN Hydrophobic bond length ( * ) D 0 0 . 45nm Hydrophobic bond elevation angle ( * ) Θ 1 π / 2 rad Hydrophobic bond azimuth angle ( * ) Θ 2 1 . 25 rad Centerline Distance Parameter ( * ) R 0 0 . 92nm Energy scale k B T 4 . 2 pNnm Bond distance stiﬀness ( * ) k 1 70 pN nm − 1 Bond angular stiﬀness ( * ) k 2 200 pNnm Hardcore repulsion parameter ( * ) k 3 50 pNnm Table 2 . 1 : Parameters in our coarse - grained mechanical model . The values are for Cortexillin CC , which has P = 12nm . Several parameters are established properties of the CC and α - helices , and are not ﬁtted . The ﬁtted parameters are marked in astericks . † This value is used for the cortexillin structure used in the MD study . The intrinsic twist for typical helices such as in the leucine zipper is closer to − 0 . 46nm − 1 . 23 r 0 e (cid:48) 2 ( s (cid:48) m ) is the CA position of the second helix . The distance between helix centerlines is R m = r ( s m ) − r (cid:48) ( s (cid:48) m ) . ( 2 . 5 ) In our deﬁnitions , we treat the hydrophobic residues as attached rigidly to the he - lix material frame . Thus , the interaction potential between hydrophobic residues is , in principle , deﬁned by the relative orientations of the helix frames ( e 1 ( s m ) , e 2 ( s m ) , e 3 ( s m ) ) and ( e (cid:48) 1 ( s (cid:48) m ) , e (cid:48) 2 ( s (cid:48) m ) , e (cid:48) 3 ( s (cid:48) m ) ) . To make the deﬁnitions simple , we deﬁned a triad cen - tered around the m - th hydrophobic residue ( v 1 ( m ) , v 2 ( m ) , v 3 ( m ) ) as shown in Fig . 2 . 1D . The orthogonal vectors are : v 3 ( m ) = 1 2 [ e 3 ( s m ) + e (cid:48) 3 ( s (cid:48) m ) ] ( 2 . 6 ) v (cid:48) 2 ( m ) = R m | R m | ( 2 . 7 ) v 1 ( m ) = v (cid:48) 2 ( m ) × v 3 ( m ) ( 2 . 8 ) v 2 ( m ) = v 3 ( m ) × v 1 ( m ) ( 2 . 9 ) The orientation of the hydrophobic bond vector with respect to this frame is shown in Fig . 2 . 1D . We deﬁne two angles , θ 1 , m and θ 2 , m , for the m - th residue between 2 helices as cos ( θ 1 , m ) = d m · v 3 ( m ) | d m | cos ( θ 2 , m ) = d m · v 1 ( m ) | d m | ( 2 . 10 ) 24 Geometrically , we see that θ 1 , m gives the amount of sliding of a helix along the CC centerline , while θ 2 , m is the angle of rigid body rotation of one helix with respect to the other . In our model , the conformational energy of the CC is thus com - pletely deﬁned by the six parameter helix conﬁgurations ( r ( s ) , ω 1 ( s ) , ω 2 ( s ) , ω 3 ( s ) ) and ( r (cid:48) ( s (cid:48) ) , ω (cid:48) 1 ( s (cid:48) ) , ω (cid:48) 2 ( s (cid:48) ) , ω (cid:48) 3 ( s (cid:48) ) ) , and the hydrophobic bond parameters ( d m , R m , θ 1 , m , θ 2 , m ) . 2 . 2 . 2 Coiled Coil Conformational Energy Having deﬁned the kinematic variables , we can write the total conformational energy of the CC as a sum of the conformational energy of the helices and bond energies of the hydrophobic contacts : E = E 0 [ r , ω 1 , ω 2 , ω 3 ] + E 0 [ r (cid:48) , ω (cid:48) 1 , ω (cid:48) 2 , ω (cid:48) 3 ] + ∆ E ( 2 . 11 ) where E 0 is the conformational energy of the α - helix ; ∆ E is the energy of hydropho - bic contact between helices . The conformational dynamics of the α - helix has been studied . It was shown that helices are rod - like and the bending and twisting stiﬀness of the helices are relatively sequence independent . Thus , one may write the helix conformational energy as E 0 = (cid:90) L 0 (cid:20) 1 2 A (cid:0) ω 21 ( s ) + ω 22 ( s ) (cid:1) + 1 2 B ( ω 3 ( s ) − Ω 3 ) 2 (cid:21) ds + (cid:90) L 0 1 2 C √ g ( √ g − 1 ) 2 ds ( 2 . 12 ) where L is the length of the helix . Here , the ﬁrst line represents the bending and twisting energy of the helix . The second line is the stretching energy . The amount of 25 stretch of the helix or the metric g is deﬁned as g = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ∂ r ( s ) ∂s 0 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 2 ( 2 . 13 ) where s 0 is the initial arc - length of the helix without any other inﬂuences . A and B are the bending and twist moduli of the helix , respectively . C is the stretch modulus . From molecular dynamics studies , it was shown that A / B ≈ 2 , and A = k B T l p where l p = 90nm is the persistence length and k B T = 4 . 2pNnm [ 41 ] . The parameters used in the model are described in Table 2 . 1 . The hydrophobic interaction energy depends on the distance between the hy - drophobic residues , d m = | d m | . In our model , we specify the bond energy as ∆ E = N (cid:88) m = 1 1 2 k 1 ( | d m | − D 0 ) 2 + 1 2 k 2 ( θ 1 , m − Θ 1 ) 2 + 1 2 k 2 ( θ 2 , m − Θ 2 ) 2 + k 3 exp (cid:2) − ( | R m | / R 0 ) 16 (cid:3) ( 2 . 14 ) where N is the number of hydrophobic residue pairs in the CC . Interestingly , after some trial and error , we found that all four terms in the bond energies are necessary , suggesting that hydrophobic interactions between residues are complex and contain both distance and angular constraints . The ﬁrst term is the bond energy that depends on the distance between the hydrophobic residues , | d m | . This distance can be deﬁned with respect to the CA atom of the residue as we have done , or with respect to other atoms in the residue . This choice does not inﬂuence the ﬁnal results , as long as the most favorable distance , D 0 is deﬁned properly . The second and third terms constrain 26 the relative angle of the hydrophobic bond with respect the CC helices . We found this term is necessary to reproduce the correct force response . Without this term , the helices will tend to twist and slide with respect to each other when forces are applied . This is not seen in molecular dynamics simulations . Finally , the last term represents the hard - core repulsion between the helices . This term prevents the helices from physically penetrating each other . When forces are applied to the CC e . g . , at one end of the dimer , the conformational energy becomes E = E − F · (cid:20) r ( l ) + r (cid:48) ( l ) 2 (cid:21) ( 2 . 15 ) where E is the same energy as Eq . ( 2 . 11 ) . Eq . ( 2 . 15 ) implies that the force is applied at the mid - point between two helices , or the force is shared equally . The bending displacement u is therefore the diﬀerence in ( r ( l ) + r (cid:48) ( l ) ) / 2 before and after the application of force . There are other situations where the force is only applied to one helix which can be similarly modeled . 2 . 2 . 3 Computation of Mechanical Equilibrium Con - ﬁgurations Formally , in the presence of an external force , the equilibrium conﬁguration of the CC can be computed by force and torque balance , which is equivalent to ﬁnding the minimum energy conﬁguration of Eq . ( 2 . 15 ) . The variables are the centerline 27 curves ( r ( s ) , r (cid:48) ( s (cid:48) ) ) and the generalized torsions ( ω i ( s ) , ω (cid:48) i ( s (cid:48) ) ) . The minimum energy conﬁgurations are solutions of equations δE δ r ( s ) = 0 , δE δ r ( s ) = 0 δE δω i ( s ) = 0 , δE δω (cid:48) i ( s (cid:48) ) = 0 ( 2 . 16 ) In practice , the calculations are carried out by discretizing ( s , s (cid:48) ) into points ( s k , s (cid:48) k (cid:48) ) with ∆ s = s k − s k − 1 = h 0 = 0 . 15nm . The solutions of Eq . ( 2 . 16 ) is a set of vectors with components labeled by k or k (cid:48) . The solutions are obtained using conjugate gradient search method . Gradients of the energy are computed numerically using 4th order ﬁnite diﬀerence . Multiple initial starting conﬁgurations are chosen to test the validity of the solutions . 2 . 2 . 4 Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Coiled Coil Under Force We use the CC dimer domain of cortexillin I ( PDBID : 1D7M ) for our MD studies . This is a relatively stiﬀ CC with P = 12nm . By deleting residues starting from the C - termini , the length of the CC is modiﬁed such that we obtain a 12 . 6nm ( 13 - Heptad ) and a 8 . 4 nm ( 9 - heptad ) CC . In VMD [ 42 ] the structures are submersed in TIP3 water and the overall electrical charge is neutralized with Cl − and Na + ions . The molecular dynamics simulations are performed using NAMD [ 43 ] with CHARMM27 [ 44 ] force ﬁeld parameters . Particle Mesh - Ewald ( PME ) [ 45 ] is used for 28 electrostatics calculations . NPT ensemble and periodic boundary conditions with a rectangular box are applied . For the 9 - heptad , system size is 4 . 5x12x4 . 5 nm and there are 20 , 000 atoms . For the 13 - heptad , the system size is 4 . 5x16x4 . 5 nm and there are 27 , 000 atoms . The temperature ( 310 K ) and pressure ( 1 atm ) in the simulations are kept constant using Langevin dynamics . Initial energy minimization is done using conjugate gradient method . Equilibration is done for 60 ps by heating up the system from 0K to 310 K , and followed by 20 ns production ( bending / twisting ) runs . During the production runs , in order to emulate the clamped boundary condition on one end , positions of the ﬁrst eight N - termini C α atoms on both chains are ﬁxed . These are GLU243 - MET244 - ALA245 - ASN246 - ARG247 - LEU248 - ALA249 - GLY250 on A and B chains . The time step for the simulations is 2 fs . The trajectories are sampled at 10 - ps intervals . We use MATLAB [ 46 ] to analyze the MD trajectories . The simulations are carried out in a Linux - based cluster with 8 nodes . The bending responses of CCs to three diﬀerent constant forces ( 7 , 11 and 15 pN ) are studied using MD simulations . The bending forces are applied at the instanta - neous cartesian coordinates of the C - termini residue C α atoms on both chains , i . e . residues GLU305 - AB for the short CC and residues ALA333 - AB for the longer . The force magnitude on the two atoms is half the total bending force magnitude . The forces are deﬁned orthogonal to the plane spanned by two vectors : the initial cen - terline vector of the CCs and the vector deﬁned by the diﬀerence between the initial positions of the C - termini C α atoms of chains A and B . The instantaneous bending 29 displacement is calculated as the tip - to - tip distance between the bent ( instantaneous ) structure and the initial structure . Statistics are collected on the ﬂuctuating struc - tures for 15 ns , discarding the initial 5 ns . For the CC twist calculations , we do not apply any torque to the structures . Instead , we gather statistics on the twist angle φ of Eq . 3 . In order to calculate the angle φ , we ﬁrst deﬁne triads along the centerline of the CC with a similar method as shown in Ref . [ 41 ] . Then , from the relative rotation of these local frames , the probability distributions of φ along the centerline are histogrammed for 15 ns . By ﬁtting the probability distributions of φ , we ﬁnd the twist persistence length , Λ t , as a function of the CC length . 2 . 3 Results 2 . 3 . 1 Coiled Coil Pitch The pitch of the CC dimer is directly measurable from X - ray structures . The mechanical model presented in this work can compute the pitch by ﬁnding the me - chanical equilibrium conﬁguration without external forces . We deﬁne the pitch based on the twist and bending of α - helix local frames ( Fig . 2 . 1C ) in the mechanical equi - librium conﬁguration . Using Eq . ( 2 . 1 ) , which gives generalized torsions on these local 30 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 5 10 15 20 25 30 Ω 3 [ rad . nm ] - 1 P i t c h [ n m ] Γ = 5 Γ = 0 . 5 Mechanical Model Fraser - McRae A B Θ [ rad ] D [ n m ] 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 45 0 . 5 0 . 55 0 . 6 0 . 65 0 . 7 0 . 75 0 . 8 14 14 . 5 15 0 2 Figure 2 . 2 : Pitch of the coiled coil . ( A ) Pitch is plotted as a function of the intrinsic twist of the hydrophobic residues in the α - helices , Ω 3 . Wolgemuth and Sun’s [ 16 ] prediction with Γ = l t / l p = 5 ( circles ) , Γ = 0 . 5 ( dashed line ) is shown . The solid line shows the solution to the Fraser and MacRae equation [ 11 ] . The crosses are the mechanical model predictions for a 13 - heptad repeat coiled coil . ( B ) The dependency of the coiled coil pitch on the geometric parameters D 0 and Θ 0 . The pitch varies less than 10 % , which suggests that mechanical constants k 1 and k 2 have a negligible eﬀect on the geometrical properties of the coiled coil . 31 frames , the pitch P is : P = 2 πw 3 w 21 + w 22 + w 23 ( 2 . 17 ) In general , because of the discrete hydrophobic residues in our model , ω i is a function of the arclength s . Here , we report the pitch value averaged over the length of the CC in Fig . 2 . 2 . The pitch strongly depends on the value of the helix intrinsic twist , Ω 3 . For historical reasons and simpliﬁcation purposes , the angle between hydrophobic residues α is taken to be α = 2 π / 3 . 6 = 100 ◦ . In fact , as Chothia [ 47 ] and Phillips pointed out [ 30 ] there are an average of 3 . 64 residues in every α - helix turn , thus yielding α = 98 . 9 ◦ . This small diﬀerence may seem insigniﬁcant , but it has a profound inﬂuence on the CC pitch because Ω 3 changes from 0 . 33 rad / nm to 0 . 46 rad / nm . Fig . 2 . 2A shows the predicted pitch as a function of Ω 3 . We see that the pitch changes by 50 % as α changes by 2 ◦ ! For most α - helices , Ω 3 ranges from - 0 . 2 to - 0 . 9 [ 47 ] . In our CC model , the hydrophobic bond energy is deﬁned by additional parame - ters : k 1 and k 2 are the bond distance stiﬀness and bond angle stiﬀness , respectively . D 0 is the equilibrium hydrophobic bond length and Θ 1 , 2 are the equilibrium hydropho - bic bond angles ( see Models section ) . We ﬁnd that choices of stiﬀness parameters , in general , have a small eﬀect on the CC pitch . However , geometric parameters D 0 and Θ 2 have a more pronounced eﬀect ( Fig . 2 . 2B ) . As the hydrophobic bond length and contact angles are varied , the pitch varies by roughly 10 % . Θ 2 also has a more pronounced eﬀect than Θ 1 . These parameters , along with sequence inhomogeneity , 32 Bending Force Magnitude [ pN ] B end i ng D i s p l a c e m en t , u [ n m ] u 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Out - of - plane Deflection Figure 2 . 3 : Bending response of the CC model compared to molecular dynamics simulations .

The average MD structures before ( cyan ) and after ( red ) the application of the bending force is shown , along with the coarse - grained mechanical model ( green lines ) . Views from the side and top are shown . The right plot shows the magnitude of the bending displacement , | u | , versus the magnitude of the applied force for the 8 . 4nm ( red ) and 12 . 6nm ( blue ) CC . The lines represent the predictions of the mechanical models : current model ( solid lines ) and Wolgemuth and Sun’s [ 16 ] prediction with Γ = 0 . 5 ( dashed lines ) . The MD results ( symbols ) with error bars are compared to model predictions ( lines ) . Both MD and the CC model show a signiﬁcant bending response perpendicular to the applied force direction ( out - of - plane deﬂection ) , although our model shows a smaller out - of - plane deﬂection ( 0 . 5 nm ) when compared to the MD result ( 2 . 0 nm ) at 15pN bending force . 33 will contribute to the diversity of CC pitches observed in protein structures . 2 . 3 . 2 Coiled coil Bending and Buckling CCs often serve as mechanical linkages between protein domains . It is therefore important to address the response of the CC to external force . Here we examine the bending property of the CC and ask whether it can be eﬀectively modeled as a thin rod . Using our coarse - grained mechanical model and Eq . 2 . 15 , we compute the response of the CC under forces ranging from 5 to 15 pN ( Fig . 2 . 3 ) . The computed bending displacement , u , is compared to molecular dynamics simulations of real pro - tein structures in explicit solvent under a constant force . Fig . 2 . 3 shows the molecular structures of the CC under force and the observed deﬂections . MD simulations are performed on two diﬀerent CCs ( 8 . 4 and 12 . 6 nm in length ) and 3 diﬀerent forces : 7 , 11 and 15 pN . After equilibrating , we collect statistics on the ﬂuctuating structure for 15ns . The shown structure is the average equilibrium structure of the CC . Superim - posed on the MD results are the results our coarse - grained mechanical model results . The model has no free parameters except for stiﬀnesses k 1 , k 2 and k 3 . The best ﬁt results are shown in Fig . 2 . 3 . The model suggested by Wolgemuth and Sun [ 16 ] constrains the distance between helices and does not allow the helices to slide with respect to each other , which can be thought of as k 1 = k 2 = ∞ in our present model . We see that both models compare well with MD results , although WS is signiﬁcantly worse for short CCs . By allowing ﬁnite stiﬀness , our current model is better matched 34 F b [ p N ] Coiled Coil Length [ nm ] Coiled Coil Length [ nm ] B end i ng D i s p l a c e m en t [ n m ] A B 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Thin Rod Theory lp = 200nm Mechanical Model Force , F 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Mechanical Model , 7 pN Mechanical Model , 15 pN Thin Rod lp = 200 nm , 7 pN Thin Rod lp = 200 nm , 15 pN Coiled Coil Length [ nm ] 6 8 10 12 MecMecThinThin Force , F Figure 2 . 4 : Bending response of the coiled coil compared to a slender rod .

The ﬁtted CC persistence length , l p = 200nm . However , the bending response of the coiled coil is not completely described by a slender rod . ( B ) shows the comparison between our model with the slender rod bending response with rod l p = 200nm . 35 with the MD results . The MD result also shows additional complex behavior that is not captured by our model . Perhaps additional long range interactions suggested by Lakkaraju and Hwang [ 35 ] can improve the model predictions . Both the MD and the mechanical model show responses to the applied force that are not replicated by a slender rod . For example , when a slender rod is subjected to a force at one end with the other end held ﬁxed , the deformation of the rod is conﬁned within the plane spanned by the force vector and the opposite end . For the CC , we observe a substantial deﬂection in the out of plane direction ( Fig . 2 . 3 ) . This is because the α - helices are not conﬁned to the bending plane , there is a signiﬁcant component of the torque in the direction perpendicular to the deﬂection plane . The complete problem requires considering the bending response of helical rods , which is beyond the scope of the work here . Nevertheless , MD and our model show similar qualitative out - of - plane movement . By examining the bending response of the CC , we also can estimate the eﬀective bending persistence length ( bending modulus ) of the CC . There are several ways to obtain this estimate . Fig . 2 . 4A shows the Euler buckling response of the CC . The position and orientation of the CC is ﬁxed at one end . The other end is subjected to a vertical downward force . The critical buckling force is compared with the rod theory prediction : F b = π 2 l p k B T 4 L 2 ( 2 . 18 ) where L is the length of the CC and k B T = 4 . 2pNnm . The coarse - grained mechanical 36 model behaves quite similar to the rod theory . The best ﬁt that gives the eﬀective bending persistence length of the CC is l p = 200nm , although a range of persistence length from 160 - 200nm can all explain the observed buckling force . However , when a horizontal force is applied that bends the CC , the response is again somewhat diﬀerent from the slender rod model with l p = 200nm ( Fig . 2 . 4B ) . Aside from the observed out - of - plane bending , the net displacement as a function of the CC length is also consistently less than predictions of the rod model with l p = 200nm . Suggesting that the CC may be slightly stiﬀer than the eﬀective rod prediction . The length dependence of the bending displacement also behaves diﬀerently than a standard rod . Therefore , describing the CC as a rod with a single bending constant is problematic . Bathe et al . [ 48 ] predicted that the bending response of parallel bundles will have a component that depend on the stretching of the transverse bonds . The overall bending constant of the bundle is also length dependent ( mode - dependent bending ) . This is consistent with our model which shows a length dependent bending modulus and shows that CCs cannot be described as simple rods with a ﬁxed mechanical bending modulus . This result has important implications in mechanics of motor proteins where force transmission between motor domains are carried out by CCs [ 49 ] . 2 . 3 . 3 Coiled Coil Twist Twisting of CCs is a common deformation encountered in proteins . The connec - tion between cargos and molecular motors are often made of CCs , and the processive 37 Coiled Coil Length [ nm ] T w i s t P e r s i s t en c e Le ng t h , Λ [ n m ] t 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 MD Average Λ MD Result SD Mechanical Model WS Result 8 t Figure 2 . 5 : Twist persistence length , Λ t , of the coiled coil . From MD simulations , the twist persistence length ( blue line ) can be estimated from the angular ﬂuctuations of the coiled coil twist , in a manner similar to Ref . [ 41 ] . The model prediction ( red line ) is obtained from applying a known torque to the CC structure and compute the twist response . Also shown is Wolgemuth and Sun’s [ 16 ] prediction with Γ = 0 . 5 ( green line ) . Results show that the twist persistence length of the coiled coil is around 100nm , although there is some length dependence . 38 ( walking ) motion of the motor introduces torsion into the CC domain . To obtain an estimate of the twist modulus of the CC , we examined MD simulation results and our coarse - grained model predictions . For a straight rod only undergoing twist deformations , the conformational energy is E = 1 2 (cid:90) L 0 l t k B T ( ω 3 − Ω 3 ) 2 ds = 1 2 Λ t L k B T φ 2 ( 2 . 19 ) where L is the rod length , Λ t is the twist persistence length and φ is the twist angle at the end of the rod . In MD , we have examined the conformational ﬂuctuation of the CC and obtained probability distribution of the twist angles . From the probability distributions , which are roughly Gaussian functions of φ , we obtained the twist per - sistence length , Λ t , as a function of the CC length ( Fig . 2 . 5 ) . The simulation result is compared to our coarse - grained model , where we have examined the response of the CC to an applied torque . The comparison shows that CC has a twist persistence length of ∼ 100nm . However , the twist persistence length depends on the length of the CC , which implies nonlinear behavior . Our model agrees with the MD results for CC lengths around 10 - 12nm . For shorter lengths , the applied torque generates twist by twisting the individual α - helices . For longer lengths , the applied torque bends the α - helices and reduces the CC pitch . The prediction of WS ( see Appendix of [ 50 ] ) suggests a slightly higher twist persistence length , presumably because the angular springs characterizing the hydrophobic bond are ﬂexible in reality . WS assumes a completely rigid interaction in the hydrophobic bond . 39 2 . 3 . 4 Conformational Ampliﬁcation So far , we have focused on the overall mechanical behavior of the CC . We have compared the CC response to rod - like objects . However , the CC has more complicated mechanical responses that are biologically important . For example , the microtubule binding domain of dynein appears to undergo a deformation where one helix is shifted with respect to the other [ 38 , 39 ] . Small molecules can also bind the CC and induce a small local conformational change . The Tar receptor of E . coli binds an aspartate molecule at one end of the CC . Upon binding , this molecule shifts one helix with respect to the other , and introduces a piston motion along the centerline of the CC of about 1 . 6˚A [ 51 ] . We ﬁnd that our model predicts a signiﬁcant ampliﬁcation of this type of conformational change , deﬁned as m 2 / m 1 where m 1 is the magnitude of the pistoning displacement and m 2 is the bending displacement at the distal end ( Fig . 2 . 6 ) . For example , for a 40nm long CC , m 1 = 1 . 6˚A translates to a bending movement of m 2 = 5nm , a 30 fold ampliﬁcation . Note that the free energy needed to introduce the small piston displacement is quite small and can derive from the binding free energy of the small ligands ( Fig . 2 . 6 ) . The amount of ampliﬁcation depends on the length of the CC . Along the same lines , if a small twist at the end of one of the helices is introduced , a bending motion also can occur in the distal end . A twist of 90 degrees in one of the helices can translate into a small bending movement at the distal end , although the degree of ampliﬁcation is signiﬁcantly less .

( A ) At one end of the CC , we introduce a small conformational change in one of the α - helices while keeping the other helix ﬁxed . A small piston displacement or vertical movement of size m 1 translates to a bending motion of size m 2 at the distal end . The top axis shows the amount of mechanical work needed to introduce the m 1 movement . The inset shows the conformational gain as a function of CC length . ( B ) The strain in θ 1 , m and d m as a function of the CC arclength , s . A piston movement of 0 . 3nm is introduced to a 40nm CC at s = 0 . Most of the strain is concentrated near the position of movement . 41 initial piston movement of 0 . 3nm . Most of the signiﬁcant strains occur within the ﬁrst 5nm of the CC . There is also signiﬁcant bending strains in the α - helices . In an experiment such as in Ref . [ 39 ] where the α - helices are artiﬁcially tied together using disulﬁde bonds , the overall bending of the CC can be prevented . This suggests that the elasticity of protein structures can transmit and amplify conformational signals over long distances , and may explain the action of small ligands binding to CC structures . In the Tsr receptor , the distal end of the receptor contacts other signaling proteins and neighboring receptors , leading to cooperativity between receptors . Our model suggests that the cooperativity arises from intrinsic mechanical properties of α - helical bundles . This mechanism is in contrast to the “wedge” mech - anism of Yu and Koshland [ 52 ] , which invokes a series of bond re - arrangement to explain the propagation of small conformational changes . Since proteins are mechan - ical structures , a more plausible mechanism involves large scale ﬂexible movements based on geometrical arrangement of protein components . 2 . 4 Discussion In this work , we explored the conformational properties of the CC in response to applied forces and torques , and developed a coarse - grained mechanical model to describe the conformational dynamics . The model treats the CC motif as two elastic α - helices bonded together by a regular pattern of hydrophobic bonds . The model is 42 able to quickly compute the conformational response of long CCs without resorting to costly atomistic simulations . The model is also compared to MD simulations for short CCs . Our model is able to reproduce most of the bending and twist response observed in MD simulations , suggesting that the model is a reasonable representation of the actual protein structure . Of course , there are other ways of parameterizing the model and the hydrophobic bonds , but it is clear that the model must consider angular constraints provided by the hydrophobic interactions . Our model can also be made more quantitative by considering the sequence dependence of the hydrophobic interaction , which can be added by introducing sequence - dependence in parameters listed in Table 2 . 1 . Additional factors such as possible long range interactions are not considered here , but could be important for longer CCs . While the elastic properties of the α - helix is reasonably simple , we ﬁnd that the CC shows more complex mechanical properties . For example , from examining the buck - ling properties of CCs , it is possible to estimate the CC bending persistence length of 200nm , approximately two times the persistence length of the α - helix . Experimental measurements of CC persistence length exist in literature [ 53 – 55 ] . However , diﬀer - ent measurement techniques seem to yield signiﬁcantly diﬀerent results . Part of the reason could be the length dependence of the CC mechanical response and the way external forces are applied in the measurements . We also ﬁnd that CCs are more com - plex , and a simple rod model does not explain all the bending responses . For instance , the bending displacement has a component that is out of the plane of the bending 43 force . The bending persistence length also appears to be slightly length dependent . The twist persistence length shows a similar complexity and length dependence . CCs are often domains in motor proteins that connects the motor to the cargo . In single molecule experiments , the motion of the cargo is tracked and observed . Our study shows that the cargo motion is not a direct reﬂection of the motion of the motor because of the complex response of the CC domain . For real proteins , if suﬃcient forces are applied the hydrophobic bonds will even - tually break , leading to possible unfolding of the structure . Indeed , studies suggest that the hydrophobic bond energy is roughly 10 k B T . In our model , the spring - like interaction potential does not allow the bonds to break . To introduce structures that can fail , it is possible to deﬁne the interaction potential by introducing a cutoﬀ . If the total energy of the bond , ∆ E , exceeds the cutoﬀ , the bond fails . With this , we ﬁnd that CCs can with stand signiﬁcant forces before failing , although the direction of the applied force and the length of the CC are important . For example , for perpendic - ularly applied bending forces such as in Fig . 2 . 3 , the 13nm structure can withstand 100pN before breaking of the hydrophobic bonds are observed . In biologically rele - vant situations , molecules rarely experiences forces of such magnitude . For example , molecular motors often exert forces that are less than 10pN . Therefore , we expect that CCs function mostly as a folded and intact structure during common deformations . CC domains in proteins are often involved in mechanotransduction and chemical signaling . Our model suggests that these functions can be explained within one uniﬁed 44 picture . The CC structure responds to externally applied forces and changes confor - mation over long distances . We also discover that the CC structure responds to local and small perturbations and ampliﬁes them over long distances . The ampliﬁcation depends on the length of the CC , and may explain why the bacterial chemoreceptor is nearly 40nm in length . The ampliﬁcation also suggests that cooperative properties of receptor arrays may be mechanical in origin , and mechanical properties of proteins is an important aspect for understanding protein function in general . 45 Chapter 3 A Mechanochemical Model of Actin Filaments In eukaryotic cells , actin ﬁlaments are involved in important processes such as motility , division , cell shape regulation , contractility and mechanosensation . Actin ﬁlaments are polymerized chains of monomers , which themselves undergo a range of chemical events such as ATP hydrolysis , polymerization and depolymerization . When forces are applied to F - actin , in addition to ﬁlament mechanical deformations , the applied force must also inﬂuence chemical events in the ﬁlament . We develop an intermediate - scale model of actin ﬁlaments that combines actin chemistry with ﬁlament - level deformations . The model is able to compute mechanical responses of F - actin during bending and stretching . The model also describes the interplay between ATP hydrolysis and ﬁlament deformations , including possible force - induced chemical 46 state changes of actin monomers in the ﬁlament . The model can also be used to model the action of several actin - associated proteins , and for large - scale simulation of F - actin networks . All together , our model shows that mechanics and chemistry must be considered together to understand cytoskeletal dynamics in living cells . 3 . 1 Introduction Actin ﬁlaments play central roles in important cellular processes such as motil - ity , division , morphogenesis , cell shape regulation and mechanosensation . In cells , actin monomers polymerize into dynamic ﬁlaments that form an entangled network . Filaments in the network are constantly undergoing changes such as polymerization and depolymerization , branching and severing / fragmentation . This dynamic mor - phological change enables the network to remodel itself in response to external stim - uli . Actin polymerization and depolymerization have been studied in vitro and in vivo [ 15 , 56 , 57 ] . The mechanical properties of actin networks also have been exam - ined in a range of experiments , from single ﬁlaments [ 58 – 60 ] to networks with actin associated proteins [ 61 ] . These experiments demonstrate that actin possesses unique mechanical and chemical properties , yet many of these observations have not been explained theoretically . In particular , there does not exist a uniﬁed model where the mechanics and chemistry of actin are considered together on an equal footing . Here , we develop such a mechanochemical model , and demonstrate that forces can have 47 a strong inﬂuence on actin chemistry . This mechanochemical coupling may explain some of actin’s unique properties in the cell . The model is also applied to examine the role of several actin associated proteins . The model represents an intermediate scale description of actin ﬁlaments , which provides a crucial link from the molecular scale to the cytoplasmic cellular scale . There have been many important studies on the unique roles of actin in the cell . For instance , a molecular mechanism of actin - driven cell motility , together with the action of actin associated proteins have been proposed [ 56 , 62 , 63 ] . Actin ﬁlaments polymerize at the cellular leading edge , and extend the membrane forward . Arp2 / 3 promotes branching of new ﬁlaments from existing ﬁlaments . Slightly behind the leading edge , ADF / coﬁlin promotes severing of existing actin ﬁlaments [ 56 , 64 , 65 ] while transmembrane integrin adhesions form between ﬁlaments and the extracellular substrate to anchor the leading edge . These processes are known to control the ﬁlament length distribution and dynamics of ﬁlament turnover [ 66 , 67 ] . Dynamics of actin ﬁlaments is also known to be involved in other important cellular functions such as endocytosis [ 68 , 69 ] and cytokinesis [ 69 , 70 ] . A common feature during these processes is that actin ﬁlaments are under the action of mechanical forces , either from the cell membrane or molecular motors . Actin network remodeling , together with the activity of non - muscle myosin II and adhesion molecules , also play a crucial role in cellular mechanosensation [ 71 – 73 ] . A recent modeling study has shown how actin - myosin bundles ( stress ﬁbers ) can form in response to cell substrate mechanical 48 stiﬀness [ 73 ] ; although , it is also pointed out that actin ﬁlaments alone can have mechanosensing properties [ 74 ] . These properties mostly arise from structural changes in the actin ﬁlament under external forces . Therefore , an improved understanding of actin mechanical response and how forces can regulate actin chemistry are important for elucidating the mechanisms of actin function in the cell . Actin ﬁlament is a staggered double helix formed by nucleation and directional polymerization of G - actin monomers [ 57 ] . The monomers that polymerize on the same helix are connected via longitudinal bonds ( non - covalent interaction ) while the monomers on two opposite helices interact through diagonal bonds . The intrinsic bond energy of a longitudinal bond was shown to be three times larger than a diagonal bond [ 75 ] . The ﬁlament subunits can be found in three bound nucleotide states , ATP , ADP and the reaction intermediate ADP . Pi . The bonds between subunits with ATP are lower in free energy [ 76 ] . Recent studies [ 77 – 79 ] have proposed full atomistic models of actin ﬁlaments by ﬁtting the known atomic structures of G - actin monomers into low resolution electron microscopy images . However , there is accumulating evidence that F - actin is an inherently polymorphic ﬁlament [ 74 , 80 – 82 ] . The structural polymorphism also potentially aﬀects the mechanical properties of single ﬁlaments . Mechanical properties of actin ﬁlaments and networks have been studied exten - sively [ 21 , 61 ] . In particular , computational [ 83 , 84 ] and experimental [ 58 – 60 , 85 ] stud - ies on the persistence length of the actin ﬁlament have been performed . Although the 49 Figure 3 . 1 : A coarse - grained model of an actin ﬁlament . ( A ) The model represents the ﬁlament as two helical chains of monomers staggered with respect to each other . The conﬁguration of the ﬁlament is described by bond distances , bond angles and local material frames attached to each monomer ( see Methods ) . ( B ) The interaction between intra - strand monomers is deﬁned by bond distance l , relative twist angle θ , and relative bending angle φ . ( C ) The interaction between inter - strand monomers is deﬁned by bond distance d , relative twist angle ϕ , and relative bending angle ψ . For detailed deﬁnitions , see Methods . 50 average persistence length with all subunits in the ATP state ( F - ATP ) is about 17 µ m , the data shows a large variation ranging from several to a few tens of microns [ 59 ] . One of the factors that can aﬀect bending stiﬀness is the nucleotide state of the sub - units , i . e . , ATP or ADP [ 58 , 86 ] . From computational studies , F - ATP was found to be twice as stiﬀ as F - ADP , and this is attributed to a structural change of DNase I - binding loop in subdomain 2 [ 87 , 88 ] . The identity of the bound nucleotide is not the only factor that could aﬀect ﬁlament stiﬀness . Due to the helical structure of F - actin , mechanical coupling of bending and twist was shown to be important , especially for short ﬁlaments [ 89 ] . In addition , factors such as ions , pH , drugs and other proteins can change ﬁlament behavior [ 58 ] . Actin interacts with more than a hundred diﬀerent actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) and these interactions alter the intrinsic mechanical properties of actin ﬁlaments and networks . Among these , Arp2 / 3 and Coﬁlin are two well studied examples [ 90 , 91 ] . Coﬁlin cooperatively severs actin ﬁlaments by increasing the intrinsic longitudinal bond length and decreasing the pitch of the stag - gered helical actin structure while the actin ﬁlament length stays the same [ 74 , 92 , 93 ] . Also , Coﬁlin - decorated actin ﬁlaments are experimentally found to be 4 times softer than standard F - Actin [ 93 ] . It was shown that the most probable location of sev - ering on the ﬁlament is at the boundaries between coﬁlin decorated and bare actin region [ 94 , 95 ] . On the other hand , Arp2 / 3 promotes actin ﬁlament branching by nucleating new ﬁlaments at an angle 70 ◦ with respect to the mother ﬁlament [ 96 ] . A recent experimental study demonstrated that Arp2 / 3 binds preferentially to the 51 convex side of a bent ﬁlament [ 97 ] . This has clear implications on ﬁlament branching especially at the cellular cortex region where actin is under large bending forces . Chemical and mechanical properties of actin have been two separate directions for modeling studies . Extensive experimental studies [ 15 ] have provided rich infor - mation on chemical kinetics of actin and its binding partners , and paved the way for elaborate simulations [ 95 , 98 – 102 ] . Mechanical behaviors of actin monomers [ 87 ] and ﬁlament models [ 84 , 93 ] have been studied with detailed molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations . However , MD currently cannot access ﬁlament - scale biologically rele - vant phenomena . Therefore , coarse - grained ( CG ) models have been proposed at the cost of lost atomistic detail [ 83 , 103 – 105 ] . Elastic rod theory has been also previously used to study F - actin buckling and force production [ 106 ] and ﬁlament severing by coﬁlin [ 107 ] . These studies provide important insights into global F - actin behavior . How the global behavior is aﬀected by the interaction between helical strands and nonlinearities such as local perturbations on elasticity , single actin subunit kinemat - ics and cooperativity yet remains as an active area of research . To fully understand the role of actin in the cell however , it is important to develop models that can ex - amine the interplay between mechanics and chemistry [ 108 ] . Currently , a detailed mechanochemical model of actin ﬁlaments does not exist . In this work , we build a simple mechanical model of the actin ﬁlament that can simultaneously compute ﬁla - ment deformations as well as internal chemical kinetics . We parameterize the model using available experimental and computational data , and use the model to address 52 chemical state changes when the ﬁlaments are under external forces . The model com - bines stochastic chemical dynamics with mechanical deformations . We outline the basic framework of the model in the next section . After the discussion of the ob - tained results , we address how the model can be improved for larger scale simulations and predictions . 3 . 2 Methods The undeformed actin ﬁlament is a straight double helical structure shown in Fig . 3 . 1A . The monomer is roughly 6 nm in diameter and the pitch of the double helix is 72 nm [ 109 ] . Within the double helix , monomers bind to each other through non - covalent interactions , forming longitudinal bonds between monomers in each helical strand and diagonal bonds between adjacent monomers in opposite helical strands [ 75 ] . The monomer is also structurally asymmetric . Therefore , the conﬁgu - ration of the monomer is described by the position of its center of mass as well as a coordinate frame that describes its orientation in space . We describe the interaction between actin monomers using a set of linear and angular bonds . The bond variables are described in Fig . 3 . 1 . In addition to the mechanical model , monomers in F - actin can have either ATP , ADP . Pi or ADP in the nucleotide pocket . The mechanical properties of the monomers depend on its chemical state . Therefore , our mechanical bond model depend on the 53 Table 3 . 1 : Bond stiﬀness parameters , bond free energies and intrinsic geometric param - eters for our model .

In this work , we specify the parameters for ATP - ATP and ADP - ADP bonds ( Table 3 . 1 ) . Finally , when actin ﬁlaments are under external force , the applied force will in - ﬂuence chemical transitions in the monomers . We investigate the inﬂuence of this mechanochemical coupling by developing a simple model for the transition rate be - tween chemical states . We use this model and the Gillespie simulation algorithm to investigate how F - actin deforms under forces . 3 . 2 . 1 The Mechanochemical Model Binding interaction between actin monomers can be thought of as a deformation free energy as a function of the vector connecting the centers of mass and relative ori - entations of the coordinate frames . Such a model would involve 6 kinematic variables , 3 for translation and 3 for rotation , but would have a large number of parameters , most of which are currently unknown . For describing bonds between actin monomers , however , motions that give rise to sliding of one monomer on the surface of the other , and rolling of the monomers with centers of mass ﬁxed are likely not allowed ( note that in both cases , the bond length remains the same ) . These motions should not be introduced because they lead to dislodging of the actin - actin binding interface . This eliminates two translational variables and a rotational variable . Therefore , the simplest model involves three variables , describing the distance between the centers of mass and two angular variables related to the relative orientations of the coordi - 55 nate frames ( Fig . 3 . 1 ) . Each longitudinal bond is parameterized by the bond length (cid:96) , torsion angle θ , and bond angle φ . Likewise each diagonal bond vector d is described with bond length d and two angular variables ϕ and ψ . The deﬁnitions of variables for the longitudinal and diagonal bonds are shown in Fig . 3 . 1B and C . These kinematic variables can all be written as functions of monomer positions p i . Binding free energies for longitudinal and diagonal bonds have been reported in the literature [ 75 ] . The mechanical free energy as a function of the kinematic variables , however , is likely complicated . Here we consider small deformations and expand the free energy to quadratic order around the equilibrium geometry of the ﬁlament . Speciﬁcally , we consider an expansion of the free energy E around the reference conﬁguration : E = E 0 + 12 ( v − v 0 ) T ∂ 2 E ∂ v 2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) v 0 ( v − v 0 ) , where v is the vector of kinematic variables ( (cid:96) , θ , φ , d , ϕ , ψ ) , and ∂E∂ v (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) v 0 = 0 . E 0 is a constant that is the energy of the reference conﬁguration , and the second term is written as a sum of quadratic terms without bilinear coupling . In total , the free energy can be written as E = 2 (cid:88) n = 1 N b (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:16) ∆ G long + U ( n ) i ( (cid:96) ( n ) i , θ ( n ) i , φ ( n ) i ) (cid:17) + N d (cid:88) j = 1 (cid:0) ∆ G diag + V ( j ) ( d j , ϕ j , ψ j ) (cid:1) ( 3 . 1 ) where U ( n ) i = 1 2 k (cid:96) ( (cid:96) ( n ) i − (cid:96) 0 ) 2 + 1 2 k θ ( θ ( n ) i − θ 0 ) 2 + 1 2 k φ ( φ ( n ) i − φ 0 ) 2 ( 3 . 2 ) with n = 1 , 2 denoting the identity of the strand , and V ( j ) = 1 2 k d ( d j − d 0 ) 2 + 1 2 k ϕ ( ϕ j − ϕ 0 ) 2 + 1 2 k ψ ( ψ j − ψ 0 ) 2 . ( 3 . 3 ) 56 Here , ∆ G long and ∆ G diag denote the bond free energies for the longitudinal and diag - onal bond , respectively . N b denotes the number of longitudinal bonds in each helix , which is also related to the number of monomers N m in each helix as N b = N m − 1 . N d denotes the number of diagonal bonds and is given as N d = 2 N m − 1 . When external forces are applied , the ﬁlament will deform and change shape , the work done by the external force is included in the energy by adding the work term as W = − f · p 2 N m ( 3 . 4 ) where p 2 N m denotes the position of the monomer at the distal end where external force f is applied . The center of mass positions and the coordinate frames of the ﬁrst monomers of each strand have been ﬁxed . These frames are chosen such that the centerline of a relaxed ﬁlament lies along the z - axis . The direction of f is par - allel to z - axis for stretching and orthogonal to z - axis for bending . The mechanical equilibrium shape of the ﬁlament is obtained by minimizing the total energy with respect to the positions and orientations of all monomers for the given boundary conditions . Therefore , for a purely mechanical treatment of F - actin , the equilibrium conformation depends only on the equilibrium bond variables but not the intrinsic bond energies . One can also examine thermal ﬂuctuations around the mechanical equilibrium conﬁguration using this model . An important feature of actin is that the monomer can adopt diﬀerent chemical states . Thus , all of the model parameters in Eq . 3 . 1 are potentially functions of the chemical state of the monomer ( Table 3 . 1 ) . In principle the monomers can have ATP , 57 ADP . Pi or ADP in the nucleotide pocket . Transitions between these chemical states are described by rate constants . The rate of irreversible hydrolysis of ATP to ADP . Pi within the subunits is on the same order of F - actin polymerization and the conversion from ADP . Pi to ADP state is 100 times slower than ATP - ADP . Pi hydrolysis [ 15 ] . As a result , in a ﬁlament , the number of subunits with ADP . Pi and ADP is signiﬁcantly higher than that of ATP subunits . Here we consider a simpliﬁed set of chemical states by representing ADP . Pi state as an ATP state and assume that these two states have similar bond energetics and mechanical properties . The bond free energies , ∆ G long and ∆ G diag , are dependent on the chemical state of monomers involved in each bond and ∆ G long is signiﬁcantly lower than ∆ G diag [ 79 ] . For example , when both monomers are in ADP states , it is estimated that ∆ G long = − 18 . 07 k B T and ∆ G diag = − 6 . 08 k B T [ 75 ] . Here k B and T denotes the Boltzmann constant and absolute temperature , respectively . ATP hydrolysis in actin ﬁlaments has been shown to be fast and irreversible , and ADP . Pi state is the intermediate and rate limiting state [ 15 ] . In physiological conditions , the actual free energy diﬀerence is small ( < 0 . 5 k B T ) , albeit a decreasing function of inorganic phosphate concentration in the medium . For illustrating mechanochemical eﬀects , we use 2 k B T [ 76 ] as the free energy diﬀerence in this work , with the understanding that Pi concentration can inﬂuence this number . From this information , we can infer the intrinsic free energy for ATP - ATP and ATP - ADP bonds , which is listed in Table 3 . 1 . In addition to bond energies , bond stiﬀnesses ( k (cid:96) , k θ , kφ ) and ( k d , k ϕ , k ψ ) , as well as 58 equilibrium conﬁgurations ( (cid:96) 0 , θ 0 , φ 0 ) and ( d 0 , ϕ 0 , ψ 0 ) are all potentially functions of monomer chemical state . There is potentially a set of parameters for each ATP - ATP , ATP - ADP and ADP - ADP bond . From actin ﬁlament structural studies , there is no evidence of structural diﬀerences between ATP and ADP ﬁlaments . For example , if (cid:96) 0 is diﬀerent in ATP vs . ADP monomers , the overall length of the ﬁlament would depend on the monomer chemical state . Therefore , we assume that the equilibrium conﬁgurations are independent of the bond type . However , mechanical properties of the ﬁlament does depend on the nucleotide states , and therefore there are potentially three sets of stiﬀnesses in our model . How we obtain the ATP - ATP and ADP - ADP stiﬀness parameters are discussed in the next section . We also assume that ATP - ADP stiﬀness parameters are the average of the ATP - ATP and ADP - ADP parameters . Transitions between chemical states are usually described by chemical reaction rates . Because the conﬁgurations of the monomers can potentially change with the chemical state , the reaction rates are not constants but are reaction rate func - tions [ 110 , 111 ] . This framework has been used for muscle contraction [ 112 ] , molecular motors [ 110 , 113 ] and enzyme turnover [ 114 ] in general . Indeed , if the global confor - mation of actin is somehow ﬁxed , hydrolysis would still proceed . Therefore , the total energy of the ﬁlament is actually a function of monomer positions , p n and monomer chemical states E ≡ E ( p 1 , . . . , p 2 N m , s ) ( 3 . 5 ) where s is an integer that labels the chemical state of the ﬁlament . If each monomer 59 can be in ATP or ADP states , then s ranges from 1 to 2 2 N m . If we are interested in rupture of actin ﬁlaments , the bonds between monomers can also break . This implies that the number of states is potentially 2 2 N m × ( 2 N b + N d ) ( see below ) . The transition rate functions satisfy detailed balance k s → s (cid:48) k s (cid:48) → s = exp (cid:2) − β ( E ( p 1 , . . . , p 2 N m , s ) − E ( p (cid:48) 1 , . . . , p (cid:48) 2 N m , s (cid:48) ) ) (cid:3) ( 3 . 6 ) where ( p 1 , . . . , p 2 N m ) and ( p (cid:48) 1 , . . . , p (cid:48) 2 N m ) are the mechanical equilibrium conﬁgura - tions for the s and s (cid:48) states , respectively . Note that these chemical state changes can occur at diﬀerent monomer conﬁgurations , consistent with the idea that monomers can hydrolyze and turnover ATP at diﬀerent rates at diﬀerent conﬁgurations . In addition , we assume that the monomer conﬁgurations reach mechanical equilibrium much faster than the chemical transition rates . This is usually the case where pro - tein conformation relaxation is on the order of microseconds or less . In contrast , the hydrolysis rates are on the order of 0 . 1 s − 1 . Therefore , the chemical transitions occur at conﬁgurations of mechanical equilibrium in state s before the reaction occurs . Detailed rate functions for chemical state changes have been measured for mechanopro - teins such as myosin [ 115 ] , but have not been measured for actin . A simple model that is consistent with the detailed balance condition is to write k s → s (cid:48) = k 0 s → s (cid:48) exp (cid:20) − 1 2 ( E ( p 1 , . . . , p 2 N m , s ) − E ( p (cid:48) 1 , . . . , p (cid:48) 2 N m , s (cid:48) ) − ∆ (cid:15) ) / k B T (cid:21) ( 3 . 7 ) and k s (cid:48) → s = k 0 s (cid:48) → s exp (cid:20) 1 2 ( E ( p 1 , . . . , p 2 N m , s ) − E ( p (cid:48) 1 , . . . , p (cid:48) 2 N m , s (cid:48) ) − ∆ (cid:15) ) / k B T (cid:21) ( 3 . 8 ) 60 l ATP ATP ATP ADP l l 0 Mechanical Strain ATP - ATP Bond Energy ATP - ADP Bond Energy Monomer - monomer Bond Length F r ee E ne r g y Figure 3 . 2 : Force - induced chemical state change of monomers in actin ﬁlaments . As a schematic example , ATP - ATP bond and ATP - ADP bond energies are plotted as a function of bond length . At equilibrium , l 0 , the ATP - ATP bond is favored . However , due to diﬀerences in the bond stiﬀness , as the bond is stretched , the ATP - ADP bond can become favorable , leading to a change in the monomer chemical state . where ∆ (cid:15) is the free energy change of ﬁlament in absence of mechanical terms U ( n ) i and V ( j ) ; ∆ (cid:15) = 2 ( ∆ G long ( s ) − ∆ G long ( s (cid:48) ) ) + ( ∆ G diag ( s ) − ∆ G diag ( s (cid:48) ) ) . k 0 s → s (cid:48) is the transition rate in the absence of mechanical forces . In the absence of forces , the rate functions are evaluated at the strain - free conﬁguration . In this case , U ( n ) i and V ( j ) are zero , and the rates reduce to the force - free reaction rates , which obeys detailed balance : k 0 s → s (cid:48) k 0 s (cid:48) → s = exp [ − β ∆ (cid:15) ] ( 3 . 9 ) Note that these chemical rate functions are phenomenological . The actual rates should depend on how mechanical work changes the transition state energy of these chemical reactions . For a 1 - D chain of linear springs , if ATP - ATP springs have 61 a diﬀerent stiﬀness than ATP - ADP bonds , then as the strain increases , the bond energies of these states can become equal , suggesting higher probabilities of ATP - ADP conversion ( Fig . 3 . 2 ) . If the bond stiﬀnesses are the same , but the bond lengths , (cid:96) 0 , depend on the bond type , then the direction of the applied force would inﬂuence ATP to ADP conversion . Since the diﬀerence in bond energies is typically small , small forces can have signiﬁcant eﬀects on ATP conversion in actin ﬁlaments . With these rate phenomenological functions , then it is straightforward to perform simulations of actin ﬁlament mechanical deformation and ATP hydrolysis simultane - ously . We use the Gillespie algorithm to perform stochastic transitions and energy minimization to ﬁnd mechanical equilibrium conﬁgurations [ 113 ] . Note that when external forces are applied to ﬁlament , energy diﬀerences between states will change , leading to faster conversion of ATP to ADP in monomers . In addition , if actin monomer bonds are allowed to break , the mechanical work done by external forces will enhance the rate of bond breakage , leading to ﬁlament rupture . The concept here is similar to fracture mechanics which also relates the rate of fracture with the total energy change . 3 . 2 . 2 Estimation of Model Parameters To perform mechanical deformation calculations , stiﬀness parameters for each spring in our model are needed . We have six stiﬀness parameters : k (cid:96) , k θ , and k φ for a longitudinal bond , and k d , k ϕ , and k ψ for a diagonal bond . Although the free 62 energies of these bonds have been estimated , these stiﬀness parameters have not been measured . However , we can use mechanical deformation data such as stretching to determine the model parameters . Recently , Chu and Voth [ 83 ] reported the force - extension curve with coarse grained molecular dynamics ( MD ) model for the actin ﬁlament in both ATP and ADP states . The length of the actin ﬁlament under con - sideration was 0 . 106 µ m . We used this as a reference for the comparison of stretching deformation from our model . Table 3 . 1 shows the stiﬀness parameters obtained by matching our model stretching results with the MD results . The equilibrium conﬁgurations ( (cid:96) 0 , θ 0 , φ 0 ) and ( d 0 , ϕ 0 , ψ 0 ) are also potentially func - tions of monomer chemical state . This would imply that ATP - actin ﬁlament would have a slightly diﬀerent conformation than ADP - actin ﬁlament . From crystal struc - ture as well as cryo - electron microscopy studies , there is no evidence that the global ﬁlament shape depends on monomer chemical state . Therefore we assume these pa - rameters are constants . The mechanical model here is similar to the work in [ 89 ] which deﬁnes a biopoly - mer using single monomers and their interactions . However , while [ 89 ] derives me - chanical parameters from microscopic data ( bond stiﬀness , subunit interface area and geometry ) , in the current work we obtain these parameters from global mechanical properties of a ﬁlament . To investigate the possible signiﬁcant eﬀects of the choice of parameters , we performed sensitivity analysis of ﬁlament deformation as a function of changes in mechanical parameters ( Table3 . 2 ) . For the stretching case 400 pN , and 63 Table 3 . 2 : Percent change in bending and stretching strain due to 1 percent perturbations on the stiﬀness parameters k (cid:96) k θ k φ k d k ϕ k ψ F - ATP Bend 0 . 91 0 . 31 5 . 72 0 . 09 0 . 04 0 . 18 F - ATP Stretch 9 . 04 0 . 08 0 . 13 0 . 16 0 . 04 0 . 60 F - ADP Bend 0 . 84 0 . 26 4 . 37 0 . 12 0 . 05 0 . 19 F - ADP Stretch 9 . 21 0 . 08 0 . 12 0 . 10 0 . 04 0 . 49 for the bending case 10 pN force were applied as explained in the previous section . The ﬁlament length in the simulation is 0 . 232 µ m . We perturbed each parameter by increasing or decreasing individually by 1 % to obtain the average percent changes . In case of stretching , the linear spring of the longitudinal bond , k (cid:96) , is the most sen - sitive and the second sensitive is k ψ . In case of bending , one of angular springs k ψ in the diagonal bond is the most sensitive and k (cid:96) is the second sensitive . This applies regardless of the chemical state of monomers . From this , one can see that the linear spring in the longitudinal bond is important in the mechanical response to external forces . When it comes to pure twist , one can infer that k θ will contribute the most . 64 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 0 . 04 Filament Length [ µm ] A x i a l S t r a i n ε 200 pN , F−ATP 400 pN , F−ATP 200 pN , F−ADP 400 pN , F−ADP 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 5 10 15 20 Filament Length [ µm ] κ [ p N / deg ] F−ATP F−ADP 0 . 009 0 . 012 0 . 015 70 . 5 71 71 . 5 Axial Strain ε F − A T P P i t c h [ n m ] x z y x 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 1 2 3 4 Filament Length [ µm ] % O u t − o f − P l ane D e f l e c t i on F−ATP F−ADP 0 0 . 5 1 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 Filament Length [ µm ] O − o − P D e f l e c t i on [ n m ] 0 . 1 pN 1 pN A B C D Figure 3 . 3 : Mechanical properties of an actin ﬁlament according to the coarse - grained model .

Stretching and bending deformation calculations are performed for varying ﬁlament lengths and applied forces . In each calculation , we consider changes in the chemical state of the monomer : i . e . , where all the monomers are either in ATP or ADP states , respectively . In Fig . 3 . 3A , the equilibrium strain , (cid:15) = ( l − l 0 ) / l 0 , as a function of stretching force f is plotted for several diﬀerent forces and lengths . As expected , an actin ﬁlament with ADP in the catalytic site is softer than with ATP . We ﬁnd that (cid:15) is a linear function of the applied force for up to f = 200 pN . The stretching modulus can be computed by analyzing the strain as a function of force . We ﬁnd that the modulus is µ = 250 MP a . In cases where there are a mixture of ATP and ADP monomers in the ﬁlament , the modulus is also well described by an interpolation relationship : µ = xµ ATP + ( 1 − x ) µ ADP , where x is the fraction of ATP monomers . While F - actin is quite stiﬀ under stretch , because it is helical , stretching defor - mation is naturally coupled to ﬁlament twist . This coupling has been discussed as a possible mechanism of mechanosensation [ 74 ] . We deﬁne κ as the stretch - twist cou - 66 pling parameter : f = κ Θ , where f is the magnitude of the stretching force and Θ is the induced twist at the end of the ﬁlament . Fig . 3 . 3B shows κ as a function of ﬁlament length , L . The error bars represent results from diﬀerent stretching forces ( 20 , 100 , 200 , 400 pN ) . The plotted relationship obeys the power law κ ∼ L b where b is around - 3 / 2 . In the inset of Fig . 3 . 3B , we see that the F - actin pitch also changes ( shown for 0 . 46 µm ATP ﬁlament ) as a function of stretching strain . These results indicate that a helical structure must naturally couple twist with the tension in the ﬁlament . If there are actin - associated proteins bound on the ﬁlament , binding kinetics and conformations of these proteins would be aﬀected by tension . This could be an - other underlying mechanism during cellular mechanosensation where actin ﬁlaments are pulled by myosin motors in stress - ﬁbers . A helical structure such as F - actin will also respond with out - of - plane bending when a force is applied perpendicular to the ﬁlament . This is caused by bend - twist coupling , which is also common in other helical bundles such as the coiled coil [ 50 ] . Using a diﬀerent model , the twist - bend coupling length of F - actin was predicted to be 0 . 4 µm [ 89 ] . This result can be compared to the elastic thin rod theory which is a standard methodology in deﬁning mechanical properties of bioﬁlaments . Fig . 3 . 3C shows the bending geometry of a 0 . 145 µm ATP actin ﬁlament and the best thin rod theory comparison . In Fig . 3 . 3D , we quantify the out - of - plane deﬂections in terms of ﬁlament length , amount of bending force and monomer chemical state . From our results , we see that the thin rod theory predicts no out - of - plane bending and therefore 67 A B 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Filament Length [ µm ] L P [ µ m ] Intact F−ATP Intact F−ADP Broken F−ATP Broken F−ADP 0 10 20 30 40 50 1 1 . 1 1 . 2 1 . 3 1 . 4 Broken Longitudinal Bond Index D e f l B r o k en / D e f l 0 Strand 1 Strand 2 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 Filament Length [ µm ] M M a x i m u m R a t i o s M Figure 3 . 4 : Persistence length L p derived from the mechanical model and the eﬀect of broken bonds .

Dotted lines with errorbars represent the mean and standard deviation in L p for ﬁlaments with randomly broken bonds ( see text for details ) . All the ﬁlaments are bent under 1 pN force .

( B ) The ratio of bending deﬂection of a ﬁlament with a broken longitudinal bond at a particular index ( abscissa ) to the deﬂection of an intact ﬁlament . Filament length is 0 . 29 µm and bent under 4 pN . is not an accurate model for short actin ﬁlaments . For long ﬁlaments ( > 1 µ m ) , the out - of - plane bending is less important . The inset of Fig . 3 . 3D shows that the amount of out - of - plane deﬂection levels out once a critical ﬁlament length and bending force are reached . 68 3 . 3 . 2 Bending persistence length and eﬀects of bro - ken bonds Bending properties of F - actin is important for understanding the mechanical be - havior of the cellular cytoplasm and the dynamics of actin network remodeling under force [ 61 ] . In the cell , actin ﬁlaments also experience forces from membranes and other proteins , as well as forces from thermal ﬂuctuations [ 99 ] . Therefore , it is possi - ble that some of the bonds in the ﬁlaments are broken . In addition , monomers in the ﬁlament can be either in ATP or ADP states . From the bending simulation results , we can estimate the bending persistence length , L p , by comparing the bending results of our model with those from the elastic thin rod theory . This comparison serves as a veriﬁcation of our model and enables us to explore the role of broken bonds and ﬁlaments with diﬀerent monomer chemical states in determining the overall actin network mechanics . Fig . 3 . 4A shows the obtained bending persistence length values of F - actin with diﬀerent structural conditions . The obtained persistence lengths of an intact F - ATP and intact F - ADP under 1 pN force are in good agreements with the reported val - ues [ 58 , 59 ] , 16 ∼ 9 µ m . Note that due to helical nature of the ﬁlament , there is some length dependence in L p . In the second set of the simulations , 5 % of all the bonds in the ﬁlament are randomly broken . This calculation is repeated 20 times and bending data are averaged . The corresponding error bars for ATP and ADP 69 ﬁlaments are shown in Fig . 3 . 4A . As the portion of broken bonds increases , the mean persistence length decreases and the standard deviation increases ( data not shown ) . Note that we compute the persistence length from the comparison of the bending deﬂection ( tip - to - tip vector ) projected onto the plane of the applied force because thin rod theory predicts the shape of a ﬁlament only in 2D ( See Fig . 3 . 3C ) . Strictly speaking , if we include out - of - plane deﬂection due to the bend - twist coupling eﬀect , the corresponding persistence length would be slightly lower than the values shown . However , bend - twist coupling is not signiﬁcant in longer ﬁlaments and therefore is ignored . The physical location of the broken bond on a ﬁlament also strongly inﬂuences the overall bending of the ﬁlament under force . In Fig . 3 . 4B , we show the ratio of the bending deﬂection of a 0 . 29 µm ﬁlament under 4 pN with a broken longitudinal bond at a particular index of one strand to the deﬂection of an intact ﬁlament . We observe that broken bonds that are closer to the ﬁxed boundary increase the amount of bending deﬂection . The eﬀect of the location of the broken bonds on bending also diminishes as ﬁlament length increases . We do not observe any signiﬁcant diﬀerence due to breaking of diagonal bonds . 70 Table 3 . 3 : Model parameters for bonds in a Coﬁlactin ﬁlament Parameter Value (cid:96) 0 [ nm ] 6 . 20 θ [ ◦ ] 34 . 94 φ [ ◦ ] - 9 . 34 d 0 [ nm ] 6 . 00 ϕ 0 [ ◦ ] 107 . 47 ψ 0 [ ◦ ] 58 . 80 3 . 4 Inﬂuence of Actin Binding Proteins In the cell , a large number of actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) interact with the ﬁlament network and alter the biochemical and mechanical state of the network . Our model can be used to investigate the inﬂuence of actin binding proteins on the ﬁlament structure . There have been studies of ABPs interacting with actin using MD . In our modeling approach , we can describe the role of ABPs by considering how these proteins can change structural parameters such as ( (cid:96) 0 , θ 0 , φ 0 ) and / or stiﬀness parameters ( k (cid:96) , k θ , k φ ) for each monomer . Binding of a single ABP can potentially change these parameters for the bound actin , and these local changes can be ampliﬁed to global changes in the actin structure . Changes in the F - actin pitch upon ABPs binding has been observed experimen - tally [ 92 , 116 ] . ADF / Coﬁlin is an important ABP whose cellular function is to sever 71 actin ﬁlaments by introducing local mechanical deformations . Coﬁlin binds between two actin monomers and aﬀects the actin - actin longitudinal bond . Therefore , its function can be modeled by changing the longitudinal bond parameters while leaving the diagonal bond unchanged [ 93 ] . To obtain the change in (cid:96) 0 in response to coﬁlin binding , we can consider the relationship between the helical pitch and the helical contour length while keeping the ﬁlament length and radius ﬁxed . A helical contour is described by the vector r ( t ) = ( r 0 cos at , r 0 sin at , bt ) where the contour length t ranges from [ 0 , L ] ; a = 1 / ( r 2 0 + ( P / 2 π ) 2 ) 1 / 2 , b = ( P / 2 π ) / ( r 2 0 + ( P / 2 π ) 2 ) 1 / 2 and P is the helical pitch . If the contour length changes from t to t (cid:48) , the changes in the ﬁlament length is given by √ gb (cid:48) L − bL , where ∂t (cid:48) / ∂t = √ g is the change in heli - cal contour length , and b (cid:48) is obtained with the new pitch P (cid:48) . Since coﬁlin does not appear to change the ﬁlament length , we can solve for √ g and P (cid:48) using the equa - tion √ gb (cid:48) L − bL = 0 . Fig . 3 . 5A shows the solution of this equation plotted as √ g vs . P (cid:48) . This result suggests that the new actin - actin bond length with coﬁlin , (cid:96) (cid:48) 0 , is approximately 1 % longer , and the pitch of the coﬁlin decorated ﬁlament is roughly 60nm . In addition to a change in (cid:96) 0 , [ 117 ] also showed that upon binding of coﬁlin , actin monomers tilt towards the helical contour axis by 6 - 12 ◦ . This corresponds to a modiﬁcation of φ 0 in our model . Table 3 . 3 shows the model parameters for the coﬁlin modiﬁed actin - actin longitudinal bond . Fig . 3 . 5B shows the overall ﬁlament conformation with a number of monomers decorated with coﬁlin . As noted by recent 72 studies [ 95 ] , we observe that maximum strain occurred at the boundaries between decorated and non decorated monomers . Finally , Fig . 3 . 5C shows the possible coop - erativity when 2 coﬁlins are bound to the same ﬁlament . As coﬁlin changes the bond parameters of a single longitudinal bond , it induces local mechanical strain on the neighboring bonds . We can compute the total strain energy of the ﬁlament as a func - tion of distance between 2 bound coﬁlins . We deﬁne ∆ E as the diﬀerence between the energy of a single ﬁlament with 2 coﬁlins and 2 times the energy of the ﬁlament with one coﬁlin . This diﬀerence can be thought of as a cooperative binding energy . Fig . 3 . 5C shows that this cooperativity is generally favorable when 2 coﬁlin molecules are in the near vicinity . The degree of cooperativity decreases as the dis - tance between two coﬁlins increases . Also , we observe that there is anticooperativity beyond two second nearest neighbor coﬁlins ( i and i ± 2 ) . Another way to understand the action of coﬁlin is that it introduces a local mechanical defect ; these defects can interact over long distances , leading to anticooperativity . Note that by stretching the actin - actin bond , coﬁlin also catalyzes conversion from ATP - actin to ADP ( see next section ) . This leads to eventual ﬁlament severing . Arp2 / 3 is another actin binding protein whose main cellular function is to nucle - ate new ﬁlaments by creating a branch from an existing ﬁlament . A recent study [ 97 ] showed that Arp2 / 3 preferentially binds to the convex side of a curved ﬁlament con - ﬁned on a 2D surface . They explained this phenomena by treating the actin ﬁlament as a structureless rod and considering curvature ﬂuctuations of the ﬁlament . They 73 A B C F D E i−10 0 i + 10 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 Monomer Index ∆ E [ k B T ] Same Strand Opposite Strand 0 10 20 30 40 −4 −2 0 2 4x 10 −3 ( l − l 0 ) / l 0 A2 A1 A3 A4 B3 B4 B2 B1 Figure 3 . 5 : Inﬂuence of actin binding proteins .

In both ( E ) and ( F ) , the peaks and valleys labeled by A i and B i corresponds to the outer in inner positions labeled in D . 74 proposed that Arp2 / 3 prefers to bind to highly curved conﬁgurations , and bending bi - ases the curvature ﬂuctuation . Within our model , actin is a double helix , and without considering ﬂuctuations , we can examine the equilibrium structure when the ﬁlament is curved . Specially , we can examine the strains in the actin - actin bonds when the ﬁlament is curved . Fig . 3 . 5D shows a 1 . 01 µm F - ATP bending under 0 . 5 pN . Fig . 3 . 5E and F show the linear and angular strain in the bonds in the bent structure shown in Fig . 3 . 5D . The results show that the strain in the inner strand ( measured with respect to positive curvature as shown in Fig . 3 . 5D inset ) is diﬀerent than the outer strand . This result is obtained for mechanical equilibrium structures without considering ﬂuc - tuations . It arises because of helical nature of F - actin . Arp2 / 3 could potentially bind between actin monomers with positive strain , and therefore preferentially bind on the outer strand of positively curved ﬁlaments . 3 . 5 Force - induced Chemical State Change and Mechanosensation In earlier results , we showed that the mechanical properties of F - actin depends on the hydrolysis state of the monomers . ATP - actin , even though is structurally very similar to ADP - actin , at the ﬁlament level is slightly stiﬀer . The consequence of such a mechanical diﬀerence is that externally applied forces can alter the chemical state of monomers in the ﬁlament . The basic concept is shown in Fig . 3 . 2 . If the 75 bond energy is plotted as a function of the monomer - monomer bond length , then the equilibrium length , l 0 , is identical for ATP - ATP bond vs . ATP - ADP bond . The free energy diﬀerence of ATP - ADP bond is taken to be as higher by 2 k B T . ( Other energy diﬀerences can be used as well , and would change the quantitative inﬂuence of force on actin chemistry . ) As a force is applied and l increases away from l 0 , the diﬀerence in the curvature of the energy landscape will lead to a crossing point . At this point , ATP - ATP bond has the same free energy as the ATP - ADP bond , therefore the probability of converting one of the monomers to ADP is enhanced . As l increases further , the ADP - actin state becomes more favorable . Thus , the equilibrium between ATP and ADP states ( actually ADP . Pi and ADP states ) is inﬂuenced by forces and changes in the mechanical energy . In the Model section , we discussed a simple model to modify the rate constants while preserving detailed balance . The actual rates may diﬀer quantitatively , but the overall eﬀect must remain the same . Using the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm , we computed ATP - actin ﬁla - ments under bending forces up to 60 pN and stretching forces up to 600 pN and allow the monomers to change their chemical state . As forces are applied , the individual monomers stochastically change their chemical state according to rate constants de - ﬁned in Eqs . 3 . 7 and 3 . 8 . The rate constant , k 0 s → s (cid:48) , has been estimated [ 15 ] . Here we report the equilibrium result as the simulation time approaches inﬁnity . Fig . 3 . 6A shows the average stretching strain for a 112 nm long ﬁlament under diﬀerent pulling forces . Due to high stretching stiﬀness , the amount of strain buildup on the ﬁlament 76 is very small . This is the reason of why there is not a signiﬁcant amount of chemical state conversion into ADP . As the pulling force is increased , the monomers increas - ingly convert to ADP . Eventually , at 600pN , all of the monomers are essentially in ADP state . Note that our model currently does not allow the ﬁlaments to rupture . It is likely that ﬁlaments would have a high probability of breaking before the ﬁlament fully converts . Fig . 3 . 6B shows the bending deformations while the chemical states of the monomers are changing . We see that if monomers are allowed to convert to ADP , the bending stiﬀness decreases as a function of applied force . This observation could potentially explain the reversible stress softening behavior of F - actin [ 118 ] . Fig . 3 . 6A and B also show the average chemical state of the ﬁlament under force with a color code ( between red and green ) . For the bending case , together with Fig . 3 . 3F , we can conclude that the monomers under highest strain are closest to the left end which is ﬁxed . This is the reason why ADP rich monomers tend to appear in those locations . Note that the magnitude of the bending forces can be quite low . At 20pN , there is already a signiﬁcant amount of conversion to ADP . For longer ﬁlaments ( Fig . 3 . 6C ) , smaller bending forces are needed to induce chemical state change because of the larger mechanical work done . The results presented in Fig . 3 . 6 do depend on the choice of ∆ (cid:15) , the diﬀerence in bond free energies of ATP and ADP states . As an alternative , we may consider a diﬀerent parameter set in Table 3 . 1 with diﬀerent relative magnitudes of diagonal and longitudinal bonds . For example , a smaller ∆ (cid:15) would lead to increasing populations 77 0 200 400 600 0 0 . 005 0 . 01 0 . 015 0 . 02 0 . 025 Force [ pN ] S t r e t c h i ng S t r a i n ε F−ATP F−ADP F−X 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0 . 05 0 . 1 0 . 15 0 . 2 Force [ pN ] D e f l e c t i on [ µ m ] F−ATP F−ADP F−X 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 Force [ pN ] D e f l e c t i on [ µ m ] F−ATP F−ADP F−X A B C Figure 3 . 6 : Loading force - induced chemical state change of monomers in actin ﬁla - ments .

We see that for a longer ﬁlament , changes in chemical states are more dramatic for the same force . 78 of ADP subunits [ 119 ] . 3 . 6 Discussion and Conclusion We have introduced a mechanochemical model of actin ﬁlaments by explicitly con - sidering the bonding interaction between actin monomers . The ﬁlament is described as two helical strands connected by longitudinal and diagonal bonds . The chemical state of the actin monomers can change , and the rate of ATP conversion depends on the overall elastic energy of the ﬁlament . As expected , we ﬁnd actin ﬁlaments are mechanically stiﬀ under stretch , but deform easily under bending forces . The model shows that for ﬁlament length much longer than the helical actin pitch ( > 1 µ m ) , the ﬁlament mechanically deforms as a semi ﬂexible rod . However , the mechanical behavior depends on the chemical state of actin . ADP - actin ﬁlaments are softer than ATP - actin . The model is also able to capture aspects of actin accessory proteins interacting with the ﬁlament . The model uses a coarse - grained description of actin monomer mechanics , and does not consider internal conformational complexity of actin , although it does include pos - sible conformational changes due to ATP hydrolysis . Therefore , it is an intermediate scale model in between atomistic scale and the network scale . Internal conformational complexity can also be partially captured using nonlinear mechanical models . Here , simple harmonic spring - like functions are assumed for monomer - monomer interaction 79 with no coupling between kinematic variables . This is the simplest model that still reproduces the essential features of actin ﬁlament mechanics . More sophisticated models can be made , but would require increased number of parameters . Neverthe - less , the model parameters can be obtained from molecular dynamics simulations , or ﬁtting to experimental data . Further studies on the model parameters would improve model predictions . In this model , we examined chemical state change from ATP - actin to ADP - actin . There are in fact many more possible chemical states , and this could underlie the mechanochemical complexity of actin networks . For instance , after ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP , the monomer can release inorganic phosphate and break the existing actin - actin bond , especially when the ﬁlament is under high mechanical load . This can lead to ﬁlament rupture . Actin ﬁlament rupture has been studied experimentally with single ﬁlaments [ 120 ] . It was found that when the radius of curvature of the ﬁlament is less than 300nm , the rupture probability increases . Also , using simple force balance considerations in a nerve growth cone , a recent study [ 121 ] has estimated the forces on a steady - state actin treadmill and showed the importance of ﬁlament rupture in resistance to retrograde ﬂow . The framework used in this work can be extended to describe such situations . By understanding the full range of mechanochemical behavior of actin , improved models of actin’s role in the cell can be made . For instance , to understand cortical actin network contraction and stress - induced softening seen in experiments , chemical 80 state changes and turnover of actin monomers in response to forces must be exam - ined . Our model is ﬁrst such model in this direction . Extrapolating to the network scale , these mechanochemical eﬀects will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the viscoelasticity of the network . Combined with nucleation , growth , contraction and turnover of the network , a quantitative model of the cellular cytoplasm can be developed . Note that these mechanochemical eﬀects may lead to unique network properties that are not present in static polymer networks where bonds between monomers are essentially permanent . Therefore , new physics may be present and could lead to surprising mechanistic insights for the cell . 81 Chapter 4 Conclusions 4 . 1 Summary In Chapter 2 , we examined the mechanical responses of typical coiled coils , and built a coarse - grained mechanical model to describe the conformations of the protein under diﬀerent load conﬁgurations . Using molecular dynamics simulations we applied bending forces onto diﬀerent length coiled coil molecules . We observed that during bending a coiled coil molecule deﬂects out of the plane of the applied force . This is due to the helical structure of constituent alpha helices and the coiled structure of the coiled coil molecule . We demonstrate that our model when bent can capture this bend - twist coupling . The con - tinuum thin rod theory result cannot capture this out of plane bending phenomenon . Also , our bending results are a better ﬁt to MD results than our predecessor WS 82 model . In order to extract the bending persistence length of our coiled coil molecule , we ﬁrst ﬁtted the critical buckling force data coming from thin rod theory prediction . The best ﬁtting bending persistence length was 200 nm , twice that of individual alpha helices . After that , we compared our coiled coil bending deﬂection results with the thin rod theory prediction . Our comparison showed that the deﬂection predictions are not simply matching even though we are using the same single bending persistence parameter . This mismatch and bend - twist coupling behavior suggest that coiled coil mechanical response cannot be fully characterized by a single parameter . Next , using molecular dynamics simulations we extracted twist persistence length of diﬀerent length coiled coil molecules . On average the twist persistence length is 100 nm , twice that of single alpha helices . We observed that the twist persistence length slightly decreases as a function of the coiled coil length . Twist persistence length of our model is about 100 nm , as well . However , the predecessor WS model coiled coil twist persistence prediction is around 160 nm . We think this result is reasonable as the WS model assumes that the hydrophobic bonds are rigid , thus harder to twist Finally , using our model we simulated the situation of sliding of one alpha helix in the coil while the other is ﬁxed . We observed that a small sliding motion is con - formationally ampliﬁed and caused the coiled coil to make a very signiﬁcant bending response at the other end of the coil . The cost to introduce this sliding motion is within the range of the energy brought in by a small molecule binding to a ﬁlament . 83 This conformational ampliﬁcation behavior was found to be increasing as a function of coiled coil length . In Chapter 3 , we described our mechanochemical model of F - actin . We quantiﬁed single F - actin mechanical behavior depending on the monomer chemical states , ﬁla - ment length , the type of the applied forces and broken bonds . Firstly , we tested the F - Actin model under stretching and found that the strain is close to the experimental ﬁndings . We observed that when stretched , the ﬁlament tip twists . This tip twist increases as a function of the ﬁlament length . Secondly , just like in the case of coiled coil , F - actin has out of plane bending and our model captures that behavior . We found that the amount of out of plane de - ﬂection decreases as the ﬁlament length increases . To check the eﬀect of the broken bonds on the bending response , we randomly broke 5 percent of all the bonds in diﬀerent length F - actin molecules . Our results showed that the introduction of bro - ken bonds signiﬁcantly decreased the bending stiﬀness of F - actin . We also observed that breaking longitudinal bonds decreases ﬁlament bending stiﬀness more than the diagonal bonds . Thirdly , we simulated the working principles of two actin binding proteins , ARP2 / 3 and coﬁlin . Coﬁlactin has a diﬀerent helical geometry than bare actin ﬁlaments . Us - ing this information we modelled a coﬁlactin ﬁlament and brought a new angle to the cooperativity of coﬁlin assembly around F - actin . Our model also brings a possible explanation of the preferential binding of ARP2 / 3 and can predict the exact locations 84 of where F - actin would branch by ARP2 / 3 . Finally , using our mechanochemical model we showed that under physiological conditions under stretching , it is very hard for an ATP - F - actin ﬁlament to convert the ATP molecules into ADP molecules . However , during bending there is enough mechanical strain on the bonds to make chemical conversion to ADP . We also observed that it takes a bigger amount of load for short ﬁlaments to convert ATP to ADP in comparison with longer ﬁlaments . 4 . 2 Future Outlook The main advantage of our proposed models over the atomistic simulations is their speed . One possible extension of our models would be going one length scale up and using the models to eﬃciently simulate the network / bundle behavior of ﬁlaments . Another advantage of our models is their capability of simulating the eﬀect of local perturbations on the global ﬁlament response . In our coiled coil model we have demonstrated this with helix sliding . There are several such biologically relevant nonlinear perturbations and our model may be a proper tool to study and understand mechanical response of bioﬁlaments . Also , in our coiled coil study , we only reported the results of the model with regularly repeated hydrophobic interactions . Nature is full of irregularities . Our model might be used to understand the global eﬀect of such irregular interactions as well . In our actin model we dealt with two actin binding 85 proteins only , but our model is ﬂexible enough to study other binding partners , tool . Actin polymerization is an important area of study . In our model , we assumed that there is no polymerization and solely focused on the mechanical response of the ﬁlament . Although introduction of polymerization into our simulations is not hard , we note that this would increase the simulation times by increasing the ﬁlament lengths and number of possible destination states . In addition to actin , our mechanochemical model framework might be used to study other mechanosensitive structures . One such structure is the focal adhesion complex ( FAC ) . To make a mechanochemical model of FAC however one needs to take into account the addition or deletion of new monomers into the complex . 86 Bibliography [ 1 ] P . R . Cavanagh , A . A .
