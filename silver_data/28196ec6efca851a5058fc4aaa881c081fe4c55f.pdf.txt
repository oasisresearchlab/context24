Defects in the actin cytoskeleton underlie numerous genetic diseases , and can arise from missense mutations in the ABDs of these cross - linking proteins 3 – 5 . Crystal structures of isolated ABDs have shown that they are composed of tandem calponin homology domains 4 – 7 but a complete molecular understanding of actin binding or its perturbation in disease has been hampered by the lack of a high - resolution structure of any actin - cross - linking protein bound to F - actin . Before publication of the first ABD crystal structures , three ABD actin - binding sites ( ABSs ; ABS1 , ABS2 , and ABS3 ) were predicted based on peptide and fragment binding studies and mutagenesis of a variety of ABDs 8 – 13 . However , their precise boundaries and relative contributions to F - actin binding were controversial and ABD crystal structures subsequently revealed that the three putative ABSs do not form a continuous surface and include many buried residues 4 , 7 , 14 . Indeed , ABS1 , which lies in the first helix of CH1 , is largely buried at the interface between CH1 and CH2 in the ‘closed’ conformation of the ABD observed in most crystal structures 14 – 16 . This , together with biophysical experiments and electron microscopy studies of ABDs bound to F - actin 17 – 22 , led to models where inter - domain rearrange - ment opens the tandem calponin homology domains , exposing CH1 domain ABSs and removing steric clashes between CH2 and actin that would prevent binding . The conformational equilibrium between ‘closed’ and ‘open’ states would thus determine ABD bind - ing to F - actin , but the identity of the actin - binding residues and the nature of the conformational changes remained to be determined . The essential actin - cross - linking protein FLNa is composed of an N - terminal ABD followed by 24 immunoglobulin - like domains , the last of which mediates homodimerization 23 . In addition to cross - linking F - actin , FLNa binds numerous scaffolding , signaling , and transmembrane proteins , and so plays vital roles in the regulation of cell morphology , adhesion , migration , differentiation , and mechanical force sensing 24 , 25 . Consistent with these essential roles , non - sense or frameshift mutations in the gene for FLNa , which is on the X chromosome , are typically embryonically lethal in males 3 , 26 . In heterozygous females , null FLNa mutations cause periven - tricular nodular heterotopia ( PVNH ) , a neuronal differentiation or migration disorder often also associated with cardiovascular abnormalities 27 , 28 . Notably , PVNH can also be caused by rare mis - sense mutations that cluster in the FLNaCH1 domain , suggesting that these point mutations result in a loss of function , possibly by disrupting F - actin binding , but this has not been experimentally tested 27 , 29 . In contrast , missense point mutations in the FLNaCH2 domain are linked to developmental malformations associated with otopalatodigital syndrome spectrum disorders ( OPDSDs ) . Unlike PVNH mutations , OPDSD mutations are believed to confer a gain - of - function effect on FLNa 7 , 30 , 31 , and in the case of the E254K muta - tion increased affinity for F - actin has been reported 7 . Here , we employed cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) and biochemical and cellular assays to investigate and characterize the mechanism of ABD binding to F - actin and to rationalize FLNa human disease mutations in molecular detail . Results A high - affinity FLNaABD mutant reveals the actin - binding interface at near - atomic resolution . To understand FLNaABD binding to F - actin and potentially explain the molecular basis of disease mutations , we used cryo - EM to visualize the com - plex between F - actin and an FLNaABD construct encompassing the N - terminal 42 residues plus the tandem calponin homology domains . In initial experiments with wild - type ( WT ) FLNaABD and phalloidin - stabilized F - actin on an FEI F20 Tecnai electron microscope , we were only able to reproduce low - resolution struc - tures similar to those seen in other ABD – F - actin structures and only the CH1 domain was evident 19 , 22 ( Table 1 and Supplementary Structural basis of the filamin A actin - binding domain interaction with F - actin Daniel V .

Calderwood 1 , 4 * Actin - cross - linking proteins assemble actin filaments into higher - order structures essential for orchestrating cell shape , adhesion , and motility . Missense mutations in the tandem calponin homology domains of their actin - binding domains ( ABDs ) underlie numerous genetic diseases , but a molecular understanding of these pathologies is hampered by the lack of high - resolution structures of any actin - cross - linking protein bound to F - actin . Here , taking advantage of a high - affinity , disease - associated mutant of the human filamin A ( FLNa ) ABD , we combine cryo - electron microscopy and functional studies to reveal at near - atomic resolution how the first calponin homology domain ( CH1 ) and residues immediately N - terminal to it engage actin . We further show that reorientation of CH2 relative to CH1 is required to avoid clashes with actin and to expose F - actin - binding residues on CH1 . Our data explain localization of disease - associated loss - of - function mutations to FLNaCH1 and gain - of - function mutations to the regulatory FLNaCH2 . Sequence conservation argues that this provides a general model for ABD – F - actin binding .

In an attempt to improve ABD decoration of actin fila - ments and increase resolution , we performed experiments using FLNaABDs containing OPDSD - associated gain - of - function point mutations in FLNaCH2 7 . This yielded 6 . 6 - Å and 7 . 4 - Å resolution maps for the Q170P and E254K mutants , respectively ( Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 1a , c , d ) . Notably , the FLNaABD - E254K map included density for the CH2 domain , albeit at lower resolution ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . We therefore used a Titan Krios electron microscope to image FLNaABD - E254K in complex with F - actin , allowing us to approach atomic resolution , resolving both the CH1 domain and F - actin to 3 . 6 - Å resolution ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . The CH2 domain was also visible , but again was at lower resolution , and is described further in later sections . The F - actin structure in the complex is indistinguishable from previously reported structures of phalloidin - stabilized F - actin ( Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) 6C1D , root mean squared deviation of C α atoms in residues T5 – C374 is 0 . 713 Å ) 32 . Until now , mapping ABSs in ABDs has been contentious ; three putative sites ( ABS1 , - 2 , and - 3 ) have been proposed , but there has been a lack of consensus on the boundaries of these sites and crys - tallographic data have been unable to reconcile these sites with a continuous binding surface 4 , 7 . Contrary to prior predictions , our structure reveals that neither the proposed ABS1 ( coarsely mapped to residues 46 – 56 ) in helix - A of CH1 nor ABS3 ( residues 163 – 181 ) in helix - A of the CH2 domain directly engages F - actin . Instead , the ABD binds F - actin through a short sequence immediately N - terminal to the CH1 domain ( residues L35 – K42 ) , which we term ABS - N , as well as the predicted ABS2 ( residues V122 – W142 ) and structurally adjacent residues R91 – L104 , which were not previously implicated in F - actin binding and which we term ABS2’ ( Fig . 1b ) . These sites mediate ABD binding in the groove between subdo - mains 1 and 2 on one actin monomer ( n ) ( 1 , 348 Å 2 of buried surface area ) and subdomain 1 on the adjacent ( n + 2 ) monomer ( burying 505 Å 2 ) ( Fig . 1b ) . FLNa residues immediately N - terminal to CH1 contribute to F - actin binding . Although most of the actin - bound FLNaCH1 domain in our cryo - EM structure closely resembles that of the unbound FLNaABD - E254K crystal structure ( PDB 3HOC , root mean squared deviation of C α atoms in residues A39 – S149 is 1 . 094 Å ) , the first turn of helix - A rearranges to engage F - actin , and we can resolve additional N - terminal residues 29 – 38 that were largely disordered in prior FLNa X - ray structures 6 , 7 ( Fig . 2a , b ) . To test the importance of this region in F - actin binding , we generated a series of N - terminal truncations of C - terminally green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged FLNaABD constructs ( FLNaABD - GFP ) and assessed co - localization with F - actin in transfected NIH - 3T3 fibro - blasts . Briefly , GFP targeting to actin stress fibers was assessed in each GFP - positive cell by a sample - blind observer using an actin - targeting score ranging from 1 ( no targeting ) to 7 ( strong target - ing ) ; additionally , overall co - localization of GFP and F - actin signals within cells was assessed by calculation of Pearson’s correlation coefficient ( PCC ) ( see Methods ) . Both methods indicated that , whereas loss of amino acids 1 – 27 or 1 – 32 had no impact on F - actin co - localization , loss of 1 – 37 or 1 – 40 partially inhibited co - local - ization and loss of 1 – 44 abrogated it ( Fig . 2c , d and Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) —implicating residues 33 – 44 , encompassing ABS - N , in F - actin binding . Immunoblotting of cell lysates confirmed that all FLNaABD - GFP constructs were expressed at their expected molecular weights ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . Of these N - terminal residues , only 37 – 44 are visible in FLNaABD X - ray crystal struc - tures 6 , 7 , forming the N terminus of the first α helix ( helix - A ) . In the actin - bound conformation , the N terminus of helix - A is deformed , moving up to ~ 3 Å ( Fig . 2b ) to engage actin via a probable cation – π interaction between W41 ( conserved in the ABD of all filamins and α - actinins , Supplementary Note ) and actin R28 , potentially Table 1 | Cryo - eM data collection , refinement , and validation statistics Krios - ABD - e254K ( eMDB - 7831 , PDB 6D8C ) F20 - ABD - e254K ( eMDB - 8918 ) F20 - ABD - Q170P ( eMDB - 7832 ) F20 - ABD - Wt ( eMDB - 7833 ) Data collection and processing Magnification 37 , 500 40 , 096 40 , 096 40 , 096 Voltage ( kV ) 300 200 200 200 Electron exposure ( e − Å − 2 ) 51 46 – 53 60 47 Defocus range ( μ m ) 1 . 0 – 2 . 9 1 . 1 – 2 . 7 1 . 1 – 2 . 7 1 . 1 – 2 . 7 Pixel size ( Å ) 1 . 33 1 . 247 1 . 247 1 . 247 Symmetry imposed 27 . 54 Å rise 27 . 67 Å rise 27 . 52 Å rise None − 166 . 73˚ twist − 166 . 89˚ twist − 166 . 88˚ twist Initial particle images ( no . ) ~ 450 , 000 28 , 000 20 , 000 75 , 000 Final particle images ( no . ) 67 , 000 28 , 000 20 , 000 24 , 000 Map resolution ( Å ) 3 . 54 7 . 4 6 . 6 9 . 8 FSC threshold 0 . 143 0 . 143 0 . 143 0 . 143 Map resolution range ( Å ) 3 . 3 – 5 . 2 5 . 1 – 8 . 6 5 . 3 – 7 . 8 6 . 2 – 10 . 2 Refinement Initial model used ( PDB ID ) 3HOC , 6C1D ChEBI : 8040 Model resolution ( Å ) 3 . 76 FSC threshold 0 . 500 Model resolution range ( Å ) 3 . 76 – 45 Map sharpening B factor ( Å 2 ) − 150 Model composition Non - hydrogen atoms 19 , 665 Protein residues 2 , 455 Ligands 5 Mg .

Mutating W41 inhibited FLNaABD targeting to F - actin in cells ( Fig . 2g , h and Supplementary Fig . 2c , d ) , further supporting the importance of this region in actin binding . Moreover , we previ - ously reported that a double K42R , K43R mutation in FLNa helix - A inhibits actin binding 33 and our structure shows that K42 may help stabilize ABS - N ( Fig . 2f ) . Residues N - terminal to helix - A also con - tribute to actin binding , and the importance of hydrophobic con - tacts between L35 and actin as seen in our structure is supported by the strongly impaired F - actin targeting of an L35A mutant ( Fig . 2g , h and Supplementary Fig . 2c , d ) . Together , our structural and func - tional studies firmly establish the biological relevance of ABS - N in ABD – actin binding . Furthermore , despite low sequence conserva - tion of this region , recent biochemical studies on utrophin 34 and a lower - resolution cryo - EM structure of the actin - bound β - III - spectrin ABD 22 indicate a general role of the ABD N terminus in actin binding . ABS2’ and ABS2 facilitate binding in the groove between adja - cent actin subunits . Beyond the ABS - N site , the remaining ABD interface with actin is mediated by ABS2 and ABS2’ . ABS2’ extends from the middle of the C – E loop into the N terminus of helix - E and engages both subdomain 2 of the primary interacting actin subunit ( n ) and subdomain 1 of the adjacent actin ( n + 2 ) —mainly via hydrophobic and H - bonded interactions ( Fig . 3a ) . We validated the importance of these interactions by mutating R91 , which is well positioned to form an H - bond with T351 in actin ( n + 2 ) ; F99 , which contacts I345 in actin ( n + 2 ) ; and L104 , which is stabilized by CH1 - V130 to make a hydrophobic contact with M47 in actin ( n ) . R91E , F99A , and L104A mutations each inhibited binding in the cellular F - actin - targeting assay ( Fig . 3b , c and Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . ABS2 encompasses part of the E – F loop , the short helix - F and the N - terminal half of helix - G , and engages actin ( n ) subdomains 1 and 2 ( Fig . 3d ) . We previously reported that a K135R substitu - tion in ABS2 strongly inhibits actin binding 33 and now show that the K135A mutation has a similar effect ( Fig . 3e , f and Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . K135 is highly conserved across all ABDs ( Supplementary Note ) and its sidechain density is directly resolved , indicating potential ionic interactions with actin E93 and D56 ( Fig . 3d ) . The importance of ABS2 is further supported by the strong inhibition of F - actin targeting of a charge - reversing lysine mutation at D125 , which forms an ionic bond with K61 and potentially H - bonds with Y53 on actin ( Fig . 3d – f and Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . FLNaABD - E254K binds F - actin in an open conformation . Further examination of our structure reveals the necessity for sub - stantial CH2 domain reorientation to prevent steric clashes with F - actin on ABD binding . In our WT and OPDSD mutant Q170P structures ( Supplementary Fig . 1a – c ) , as well as other published lower - resolution structures 18 , 19 , 22 , density for the CH2 domain was not evident , consistent with CH2 domain motion in the F - actin - bound form . In contrast , in both our F20 and Krios E254K struc - tures the CH2 domain is apparent , albeit with weaker cryo - EM density and at lower resolution than the rest of the map ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . The lower resolution of this domain again indicates its mobility but was sufficient to reveal that it is oriented outwards and away from actin . Comparison of our actin - bound FLNaABD - E254K structure with the closed conformation seen in the FLNaABD - E254K crystal structure 7 indicates that the closed conformation is incompatible with F - actin binding . As reported previously for α - actinin 19 , superposition of the CH1 domains in the actin - bound crystal structures reveals that , in the closed con - formation , CH2 would clash with F - actin ( Fig . 4b ) . We therefore conclude that an outward movement of the CH2 domain facili - tates CH1 - mediated binding to actin ( Fig . 4c ) . Consistent with this model , isolated FLNaCH1 - GFP strongly targeted to F - actin 33 while FLNaCH2 - GFP showed no targeting , even with OPDSD muta - tions Q170P or E254K which otherwise promoted ABD targeting ( Fig . 4d , e and Supplementary Fig . 4a , b ) . In addition to avoiding steric clashes with actin , our structure reveals that CH2 reorientation also exposes a previously unrecog - nized and highly conserved actin - binding residue ( W142 ) at the C terminus of ABS2 . Notably , in unbound FLNaABD crystal struc - tures W142 interacts with H255 in CH2 , possibly ‘latching’ the ABD in a closed conformation ( Fig . 5a ) . In contrast , in our actin - bound structure , this interaction is replaced by hydrophobic contacts between W142 and actin ( Fig . 5b ) , and a W142A mutation inhib - ited targeting to F - actin in cells ( Fig . 5c , d and Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . These data argue that W142 plays a regulatory role by binding either CH2 in a closed inhibitory state , or F - actin in the open active a 90° Actin ( n ) Actin ( n + 1 ) Actin ( n + 2 ) SD1 SD2 SD4 SD3 SD1 SD2 SD4 SD3 ABS2 ʹ ABS2 ABS - N CH1 b Fig . 1 | Cryo - eM map and model of FlNaABD - e254K bound to F - actin . a , The cryo - EM map ( left and middle ) has been filtered to 3 . 6 - Å resolution , masked to illustrate the actin and FLNaCH1 region , and fit with computationally refined models ( right ) for actin ( different subunits in dark blue , cyan , and light blue ) and the FLNaCH1 domain ( green ) .

In α - actinin - 4 , the homologous W147 may serve a similar role by engaging K255 in CH2 . Consistent with this , K255 mutations that presumably unlatch the ABD and increase affinity for F - actin are associated with the kidney disease focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 35 . Indeed , disease - associated gain - of - function mutations are found throughout the CH2 domain of FLNa and other ABDs including in its hydrophobic core ( Supplementary Note ) . Purified OPDSD - associated mutant FLNaABDs ( Q170P or E254K ) analyzed by scanning fluorimetry exhibited sharp melting points at lower temperatures than WT FLNaABD , indicative of altered sta - bility ( Fig . 5e ) . Consistent with their enhanced F - actin targeting ( Fig . 4d , e and Supplementary Fig . 4a , b ) , OPDSD - associated ABD mutants also displayed increased affinity for F - actin in co - sedimen - tation assays ( Fig . 5f , g and Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . We hypothesize that OPDSD mutations destabilize the CH2 domain in the closed ABD position and shift the conformational equilibrium in favor of ABD opening , facilitating CH1 - mediated F - actin binding . FLNa CH1 domain disease mutations confer loss of function . In addition to the gain - of - function CH2 domain mutations that cause OPDSD , mutations in FLNa are also linked to the neuronal migra - tion disorder PVNH 27 . Most FLNa PVNH mutations are non - sense and frameshift , resulting in the loss of FLNa protein 3 , 27 . However , rare PVNH - associated missense mutations that cluster in the FLNaCH1 domain are also seen , and result in phenotypically simi - lar , albeit somewhat milder , disease 27 . We propose that these muta - tions , many of which are found in the ABS - N , ABS2 , and ABS2’ ( Supplementary Note ) , disrupt the actin - binding interface and cause a loss of function . Consistent with this , the PVNH mutations A39G and A128V strongly impaired FLNaABD targeting to F - actin in cells ( Fig . 6a , b and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) and F - actin binding in in vitro co - sedimentation assays ( Fig . 6c , d and Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . Our ability to purify soluble recombinant FLNaABD mutants with size - exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) profiles consis - tent with monomeric protein ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) argues that the mutations do not result in general misfolding . This conclusion is supported by their sharp melting points in differential scanning fluorimetry experiments ( Fig . 6e ) . Notably , despite a WT melting point and elution profile ( Fig . 6e and Supplementary Fig . 5b ) , indi - cating that FLNaABD A39G is properly folded , it does not appear to bind actin with the 1 / 1 ratio seen for the WT and other gain - and loss - of - function mutations ( Fig . 6c and Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . This suggests an anomalous binding mechanism . We propose that A39 ( in ABS - N ) normally stabilizes the actin - binding residue W41 ( Fig . 2e , f ) . While loss of this stabilization is likely to account for the observed reduction in binding affinity , it is difficult to envis - age how it also alters stoichiometry of binding , either by occluding adjacent binding sites or by altering F - actin conformation .

For a second PVNH mutation , A128V , we note that A128 does not make direct contact with F - actin but packs tightly behind the main interacting surface of ABS2 ( helix - F ) . An A128V substitution would perturb this surface ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) , probably explaining its disruption of actin binding and possibly contributing to the decrease in thermal stability seen in scanning fluorimetry experiments ( Fig . 6e ) . Our structure also allows us to rationalize the previously unexplained M102V PVNH - associated mutation that lies in ABS2’ and inhibited F - actin binding in cells ( Fig . 6a , b and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . M102 , in conjunction with F99 , extends towards I345 of actin ( n + 2 ) ( Fig . 3a ) and substitu - tion with the shorter valine probably prevents this interaction . Two other PVNH - associated FLNa mutations that lie outside the actin - binding interface ( E82V and S149F ) had little or no effect on F - actin targeting , producing only modestly reduced actin - targeting scores but no reduction in PCC ( Fig . 6a , b and Supplementary Fig . 5a , d ) ; the basis for their clinical effects remains unclear . Additional FLNaCH1 domain PVNH mutations also occur in ABS2 . The V122 side chain is wedged between H87 and H88 of actin ( n ) and a V122G mutation strongly inhibited association with F - actin ( Fig . 6a , b and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . The K127N severely inhibited actin target - ing , and in our structure K127 is in range to make an ionic bond with E167 in actin ( n + 2 ) ( Fig . 6a , b and Supplementary Fig 5a ) . Notably , disease - associated mutations in the ABD of FLNc and α - actinin - 2 also localize to regions corresponding to FLNa ABS2 36 , 37 ( Supplementary Note ) . Mutations at I119 inhibited F - actin binding ( Fig . 6a , b and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) , probably due to disruption of the hydrophobic core of CH1 , and α - actinin - 1 and - 2 also contain disease - associated mutations in this region 38 , 39 . Discussion Our high - resolution cryo - EM structure of FLNaABD - E254K bound to F - actin provides a detailed foundation for understanding the molecular basis of actin binding by tandem calponin homology domains , revealing several new features of the ABD – actin bind - ing mechanism . We show that , on actin binding , FLNa residues immediately N - terminal to the CH1 domain become ordered and contribute to F - actin binding . By identifying three ABSs ( ABS - N , ABS2’ , and ABS2 ) , we resolve controversy surrounding the specific sites involved in F - actin binding . We find that ABS - N participates in hydrophobic and potential cation – π interactions with subdo - main 1 of actin , while ABS2’ binds an adjacent F - actin subunit . The previously mapped ABS2 also makes key ionic and hydropho - bic interactions . The functional importance of each of these sites was validated using structure - guided mutations . Our structure also indicates CH2 domain movement associated with actin binding , establishing that , as previously proposed based on earlier lower - resolution structures 18 , 19 , 22 , binding involves ABD opening and does not involve direct CH2 – actin interactions . In addition to avoiding steric clashes of the CH2 domain with actin , ABD opening exposes the highly conserved actin - binding residue W142 in ABS2 which , in the closed conformation , binds the CH2 domain , serving as a a V130 L104 M47 F99 I345 R91 T351 M102 Helix - E d I119 V122 K127 A128 D125 D56 E93 K135 W142 K61 H87 H88 E167 Helix - F Helix - E Helix - G Helix - A Y53 C - E Loop Helix - C b e G F P W T R 91 E F 99 A L104 A 1 2 3 4 A c t i n - t a r ge t i ng sc o r e 1 2 3 4 A c t i n - t a r ge t i ng sc o r e FLNaABD - GFP * * * * c P = 0 . 0243 G F P W T R 91 E F 99 A L104 A – 0 . 4 – 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 P CC f – 0 . 4 – 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 P CC FLNaABD - GFP * * * * G F P W T D 125 K K 135 A FLNaABD - GFP G F P W T D 125 K K 135 A FLNaABD - GFP * * * n = 136 131 137 136 135 n = 116 111 118 118 127 n = 144 171 136 136 n = 123 138 119 115 * * * Fig . 3 | ABS2 and ABS2’ facilitate major binding interactions with F - actin . a , Detailed view of the FLNa ABS2’ ( green ) binding interface with the actin ( n + 2 ) subunit ( light blue ) and actin ( n ) ( dark blue ) . b , F - actin - targeting scores of ABS2’ - mutant FLNaABD - GFP .

Finally , combining cellular and biochemical analysis of disease - associated FLNaABD mutations with our structural studies helps explain the localization of PVNH disease - associated loss - of - function point mutations to the actin - binding CH1 domain and gain - of - function OPDSD muta - tions to the regulatory CH2 domain . The N - terminal flanking regions of ABDs are diverse in length and sequence , but the ABS - N sequence is conserved in filamins and α - actinins ( Supplementary Note ) and , despite relatively low sequence similarity with the FLNa N terminus , deletion of residues 1 – 27 in utrophin ABD or 1 – 51 in β - III - spectrin ABD has been shown to dramatically reduce F - actin binding 22 , 34 . Thus , residues N - terminal to CH1 have functionally conserved biological signifi - cance in multiple ABDs . Notably , at least in the case of FLNa , residues preceding ABS - N are not necessary for actin binding as N - terminal truncations ( Δ 1 – 27 and Δ 1 – 32 ) did not diminish ABD co - localization with F - actin . Consistent with this , an alternative FLNa transcript that results in initiation at M28 ( equivalent to our Δ 1 – 27 ABD ) produces functional FLNa protein that targets to F - actin 40 . Furthermore , FLNb also has a relatively short N terminus ( equivalent to the Δ 1 – 27 FLNaABD ) and the FLNbABD binds F - actin with affinities comparable to the FLNaABD in the present study 41 . This suggests that the variability in sequence N - terminal to ABS - N may provide mechanisms to regulate ABD binding to actin . Indeed , calmodulin binding to N - terminal residues of plectin has been proposed to regulate plectin interactions with F - actin 42 , 43 . Calmodulin has also been reported to inhibit FLNa binding to F - actin 44 but , rather than binding the N - terminal region , calmodulin was proposed to utilize a cryptic binding site ( residues 87 – 96 ) in the FLNaCH1 domain that became exposed upon F - actin binding . We now show that the proposed calmodulin - binding site faces away from F - actin and we observe no substantial conformational changes in this site upon F - actin binding , making it unclear how calmodulin would selec - tively bind this region in the FLNaABD – F - actin complex to drive dissociation . Furthermore , despite the strong sequence and struc - tural conservation between FLNa and FLNb , calmodulin did not inhibit FLNb binding to F - actin 41 . The structural basis for any effect of calmodulin on FLNa binding to F - actin therefore remains to be determined . FLNa binding to F - actin is , however , clearly influenced by the CH2 domain and our structural data show that , when bound to F - actin , the FLNaABD domain adopts an ‘open’ position distinct from the closed conformations seen in FLNaABD crystal struc - tures 6 , 7 . However , even in the F - actin - bound FLNaABD E254K structure , the lower resolution of the CH2 domain reveals that this domain is mobile and this presumably explains why it was not vis - ible in most other ABD – actin complexes 19 , 22 . An open conforma - tion is necessary to avoid steric clashes with actin and to expose the otherwise occupied F - actin binding residue W142 in ABS2 . b CH2 CH1 X - ray CH1 cryo CH2 X - ray CH2 cryo c a 90° 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 A c t i n - t a r ge t i ng sc o r e FLNaABD CH1 CH2 d * * * * * * * n = 320 331 149 153 135 170 166 160 n = 253 279 136 114 79 151 144 135 – 0 . 4 – 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 P CC FLNaABD CH1 CH2 e * * * * * * * G F P W T Q 170 P E 254 K W T W T Q 170 P E 254 K G F P W T Q 170 P E 254 K W T W T Q 170 P E 254 K Fig . 4 | opening of the ABD is required to avoid steric clashes and facilitate actin binding . a , Low - pass filtered ( 10 - Å resolution ) map of FLNaABD - E254K bound to F - actin .

W142 is completely conserved across ABDs ( Supplementary Note ) and has been implicated in latching α - actinin - 4 35 and plectin 45 closed , indicat - ing that this switching mechanism may be conserved mechanism for controlling the conformational equilibrium of many , if not all , tandem calponin homology ABDs . Our cellular and biochemical studies demonstrate loss of actin binding with most of the human PVNH mutations that localize to FLNaCH1 . While some appear to disrupt direct molecular interactions with F - actin ( M102V , V122G , K127N ) , others prob - ably elicit their effects by deforming ABSs or the CH1 domain in general ( A39G , I119D , A128V ) . Conversely , we propose that the FLNaABD exists in a conformational equilibrium in solution and that the gain - of - function OPDSD mutations in the CH2 domain exert their effects by shifting that equilibrium towards open states .

NAtuRe StRuCtuRAl & MoleCulAR BIology | VOL 25 | OCTOBER 2018 | 918 – 927 | www . nature . com / nsmb 927 Articles NATure STruCTurAL & MOLeCuLAr BiOLOgy Methods Reagents and DNA constructs . Polyclonal anti - GFP ( 600 - 101 - 215 , Rockland ) , anti - vinculin ( V9131 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , secondary anti - goat - 680RD ( 926 - 68074 , LI - COR ) , secondary anti - mouse 800CW ( 925 - 32212 , LI - COR ) , and Alexafluor - 568 - phalloidin ( Life Technologies ) were purchased . Polyclonal anti - human FLNa antibody , which cross - reacts with mouse FLNa , was raised in rabbits 46 , 47 . Fibronectin solution ( 1 mg ml − 1 ) was purchased ( F1141 , Sigma ) . Human FLNa - ABD and - CH domain constructs in a pcDNA3 vector with a C - terminal GFP tag have been described previously 33 , 48 , 49 . FLNa mutations were generated by QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis ( Stratagene ) . For bacterial expression , select FLNa - ABD constructs were also subcloned into a modified pET32 - 6xHis vector using KpnI and EcoRI restriction sites to generate N - terminally His - tagged FLNaABD . Cell culture . Mouse NIH3T3 cells were obtained from Yale colleagues and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination . Cells were cultured in DMEM ( 11965 , GIBCO ) with 9 % bovine serum ( 16170078 , GIBCO ) and penicillin / streptomycin ( 15140122 , GIBCO ) , and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 . To express FLNa constructs , 8 × 10 4 cells per well were plated in a 6 - well dish and 24 h later were transfected with 1 . 5 µ g plasmid DNA using polyethyleneimine ( 23966 - 1 , Polysciences Inc . ) . Actin filament targeting and microscopy . Transfected cells were plated on coverslips previously coated with 5 µ g ml − 1 fibronectin and cultured for 24 h . Cells were washed with PBS and then fixed and permeabilized in cold 4 % paraformaldehyde + 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in cytoskeletal buffer ( 10 mM MES , pH 6 . 1 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM glucose ) for 30 min at room temperature . Coverslips were washed with PBS and incubated in cytoskeletal buffer containing 0 . 2 % BSA , 50 mM NH 4 Cl , and 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 for 1 h at room temperature , then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexafluor - 568 - Phalloidin in the same buffer and washed in PBS . Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant ( P36965 , Invitrogen ) . Microscopy images of transfected cells expressing comparable levels of GFP were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope with a × 100 objective using Micro - Manager software 50 and analyzed in ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , rsb . info . nih . gov ) . To quantify GFP - tagged FLNaABD targeting to actin filaments , co - localization of GFP and phalloidin - 568 signal was scored on a scale of 1 ( low overlap ) to 7 ( high overlap ) in a sample - blind manner . To avoid potential bias in assigning co - localization scores , GFP and phalloidin - 568 signal images were also subjected to an automated CellProfiler co - localization function 51 to normalize images and calculate the PCC between the two images . Images were excluded from automated PCC scoring if the field contained non - expressing or multiple cells . In all cases , the expression of the GFP - tagged FLNa construct at the predicted molecular weight was confirmed by immunoblotting against GFP , while vinculin was used as a loading control . Protein purification . 6xHis - tagged FLNaABD DNA constructs were expressed in Rosetta strain Escherichia coli and induced with 500 µ M isopropyl - β - d - thiogalactoside for 18 h at 16 °C . Bacterial cultures were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 9 , 500 mM NaCl , 5 mM imidazole , 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 700 µ g ml − 1 lysozyme , 6 . 4 µ g ml − 1 DNAse1 ) at 4 °C . 6xHis - tagged proteins were purified over Ni - NTA beads ( 70666 , Novagen ) , eluted with 400 mM imidazole , and dialyzed into co - sedimentation assay buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 01 % Triton X - 100 , 5 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) ) . Proteins were further purified by SEC on a Superdex200 Prep Grade column ( GE Healthcare ) , then concentrated using a 10 - kDa MWCO centrifugal filter unit ( UFC801024 , Millipore ) , flash frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at − 80 °C until use . Purified proteins remained monomeric after concentration and freezing , as seen in SEC ( data not shown ) . Actin co - sedimentation assays . Actin , purified from chicken breast into G buffer ( 2 mM Tris pH 8 , 200 µ M ATP , 5 mM DTT , 100 µ M CaCl 2 ) and stored at − 80 °C until use , was a gift from the Koleske Lab ( Yale ) 52 . G - actin ( 1 µ M ) was polymerized with 20 mM imidazole , 150 mM KCl , 2 mM EGTA , 4 mM DTT , and 2 mM MgCl 2 for 30 min at room temperature and stabilized with 1 µ M phalloidin . Polymerized actin was titrated with a range of FLNaABD concentrations in co - sedimentation assay buffer , incubated at room temperature for 1 h , and spun at 270 , 000 g in a Beckman TLA - 100 rotor . Supernatants were collected , and protein pellets were washed with co - sedimentation assay buffer then resuspended in water . Then , 30 % of the supernatant sample and 100 % of the pellet sample were loaded for SDS – PAGE separation . Gels were stained with Coomassie blue , destained , and scanned for densitometry using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System ( LI - COR ) . No - actin control ABD band intensities were subtracted from the corresponding co - sedimented ABD bands to remove F - actin - independent sedimentation signal and divided by the intensity of the actin to normalize for F - actin loading . Data points were fitted to a one - site binding model in Prism software ( GraphPad ) to calculate apparent binding affinity and stoichiometry 53 . Differential scanning fluorimetry . His - tagged FLNaABD thermal stability was determined by differential scanning fluorimetry with SYPRO orange 54 ( S6650 , Invitrogen ) using a CFXConnect Real - Time PCR Detection System ( BioRad ) . ABD ( 30 µ M ) in co - sedimentation assay buffer was mixed with SYPRO orange and heated from 4 °C to 95 °C in 1 - °C increments over 2 h . Data were collected in triplicate wells using the FAM filter from three independent experiments . Melting temperatures were calculated from the first derivative of the melting curve using the BioRad CFX Manager software . Cryo - EM sample preparation and data collection . Purified 6xHis - FLNaABD - WT , - Q170P , or - E254K were incubated at 60 µ M with 15 µ M phalloidin - stabilized F - actin in a low - salt co - sedimentation assay buffer ( described above ) at least 30 min before freezing . The Q170P and E254K samples were diluted 1 / 1 in H 2 O immediately before freezing . Samples were prepared using holey carbon grids ( Quantifoil R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 Micro Tools GmbH ) and a manual plunger device . Micrograph data sets were collected on a 200 - kV FEI Tecnai F20 electron microscope equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron - counting camera at a pixel size of 1 . 247 Å . Micrographs were recorded in 0 . 3 - s subframes over 7 . 2 – 10 . 2 s for a total dose of 47 – 60 e − Å − 2 over a nominal defocus range of 1 . 1 – 2 . 7 µ m . Later , a separate data set on the E254K sample was collected on a 300 - kV Titan Krios microscope equipped with an energy filter and a Gatan K2 Summit camera in super - resolution mode at a physical pixel size of 1 . 33 Å . Micrographs were recorded in 0 . 25 - s subframes over 12 s for a total dose of 50 e − Å − 2 over a nominal defocus range of 1 . 0 – 2 . 9 µ m . Three - dimensional refinement . Micrographs were aligned and dose - corrected using MotionCor2 55 , where subframe motion correction ( 3 × 3 array ) was applied to the WT and Tecnai F20 E254K data sets , while the Krios E254K data set was binned by 2 . The Krios E254K data set was corrected for magnification distortion using parameters estimated by mag _ distortion _ estimate 56 . Contrast transfer function parameters were calculated using Gctf 57 , and micrographs where Gctf did not detect signal at resolutions better than < 4 Å were excluded from structural refinement for the Krios E254K data set . Filaments were manually selected using e2helixboxer from the EMAN software package 58 and extracted at a spacing of ~ 27 . 5 Å . The WT , Q170P , and E254K data sets collected on the Tecnai F20 used a box size of 390 pixels , while the Krios E254K data set used a box size of 210 pixels . Structure refinement was performed using iterative helical real space reconstruction single - particle processing 59 , 60 as implemented in RELION ( version 2 . 0 . 3 ) 61 , 62 . The first round of refinement employed masks generated from earlier refinements that were low - pass filtered to 60 Å and included 10 – 20 Å soft edges using the relion _ mask _ create tool . The Tecnai F20 E254K and Q170P data sets were further processed in a second round of refinement using a mask generated from the 7 central actin subunits and CH1 domains that were low - pass filtered to 60 Å and included 15 Å soft edges . The Krios E254K data set was also improved in a second round of refinement using a helical mask generated from the results of the first round of refinement but constrained to the central 30 % Z - slice , low - pass filtered to 60 Å , and included 6 . 5 Å soft edges . The WT data were subjected to a particle subtraction and masked three - dimensional classification approach described elsewhere 63 to determine occupancy at the single subunit level . The decorated class ( ~ 33 % particles ) was then restored to its unsubtracted state and further refined using the same mask as earlier in the first round of refinement . The resolution and B - factor of the final maps were calculated from the Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) of independent half - maps in postprocessing with RELION following gold standard protocols ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Symmetry was first imposed in real space on the independent half maps in the Tecnai F20 E254K ( 27 . 67 Å rise , − 166 . 89° twist ) , Q170P ( 27 . 52 Å rise , − 166 . 88˚ twist ) , and Krios E254K ( 27 . 54 Å rise , − 166 . 73˚ twist ) data sets using the relion _ helix _ toolbox command . The imposed helical parameters were derived from local searches of symmetry on the full map in RELION . The FSC calculations for the Tecnai F20 E254K and Q170P data sets used a mask generated from earlier refinements that was thresholded to contain only actin subunits and CH1 domains , low - pass filtered to 20 Å , and included 15 Å soft edges . The resolution of the Tecnai F20 E254K map reached 7 . 4 Å , while the Q170P map reached 6 . 6 Å . The symmetrized Krios E254K volume was used to generate a mask that included only actin and the CH1 domains , was low - pass filtered to 15 Å , and included 8 Å soft edges . This mask was next used in postprocessing calculations , where the final Krios E254K map reached a resolution of 3 . 6 Å . The final symmetrized Krios E254K map was low - pass filtered to 3 . 6 Å and sharpened with a B - factor of − 150 . The FSC calculations for the WT data set used the same mask from its structural refinement , and reached a resolution of 9 . 8 Å . The resolution ranges of each map were estimated using blocres from the Bsoft software package 64 . Model building , refinement , and validation . PDB models of phalloidin - stabilized F - actin ( PDB ID 6C1D , chain B , residues 1 – 375 ) 32 and FLNa CH1 ( PDB ID 3HOC , chain A , residues 39 – 153 ) 7 were first fit as rigid bodies into the final symmetrized Krios E254K map using UCSF Chimera 65 . This model was refined against the final map in Phenix 66 using real - space refinement with simulated annealing . Next , the model was refined by manual adjustments and all molecule real - space refinement with Ramachandran restraints in Coot 67 and real - space refinement in Phenix without simulated annealing . After several iterations , additional N - terminal FLNa residues were built by the N - terminal addition of residues into the cryo - EM density NAtuRe StRuCtuRAl & MoleCulAR BIology | www . nature . com / nsmb Articles NATure STruCTurAL & MOLeCuLAr BiOLOgy in Coot and followed by real - space refinement in Phenix . Multiple subunits and phalloidin subunits ( PDB ID 6C1D ) were loaded into the neighboring densities and evaluated in MolProbity 68 for steric clashes , which were manually fixed in Coot . Next , structural data for phalloidin ( Chemical Entities of Biological Interest identity 8040 ) 69 was used to generate geometric restraints in eLBOW 70 for real - space refinement with the final map in phenix . The refined phalloidin chains were combined with the model . The final model was evaluated by MolProbity and data statistics are given in Table 1 . Cation – π interactions were investigated using the CaPTURE program 71 . Structural figures were generated in ChimeraX 72 . Statistics and reproducibility . For cellular F - actin co - localization experiments , each GFP - tagged FLNa construct or GFP alone was tested in at least 3 independent transfections , with at least 25 image pairs collected for each construct per experiment for quantification . Actin - targeting scores or PCC scores from imaged cells for each construct were averaged and compared to FLNaABD - WT by one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) ( P < 0 . 0001 for all ANOVAs ) with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test ; precise values for n , F , and degrees of freedom are listed in the relevant figures and legends . For co - sedimentation assays , each 6xHis - tagged FLNa protein was tested in at least four independent assays , and average apparent K d of each mutant FLNaABD was compared to WT with an unpaired two - tailed t - test ; precise values for n , t , P , and degrees of freedom are listed in the relevant figures and legends . For differential scanning fluorimetry , average melting temperature of each mutant FLNaABD was compared to WT from triplicate wells of three independent experiments by one - way ANOVA ( F 4 , 40 = 339 . 1 , P < 0 . 0001 ) with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test .
