Recent studies indicate that surface - associated NLGN1 is diffusionally trapped at synapses , where it interacts with quasi - static scaffolding elements of the post - synaptic density . Whereas single molecule tracking reveals rapid diffusion and transient immobilization of NLGN1 at synapses within seconds , ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments indicate instead a long - term turnover of NLGN1 at synapse , in the hour time range . To gain insight into the mechanisms supporting NLGN1 anchorage at post - synapses and try to reconcile those experimental paradigms , we quantitatively analyzed here live - cell and super - resolution imaging experiments performed on NLGN1 using a newly released simulator of membrane protein dynamics for ﬂuorescence microscopy , FluoSim . Based on a small set of parameters including diffusion coefﬁcients , binding constants , and photophysical rates , the framework describes fairly well the dynamic behavior of extra - synaptic and synaptic NLGN1 over both short and long time ranges , and provides an estimate of NLGN1 copy numbers in post - synaptic densities at steady - state ( around 50 dimers ) . One striking result is that the residence time of NLGN1 at synapses is much longer than what can be expected from extracellular interactions with pre - synaptic neurexins only , suggesting that NLGN1 is stabilized at synapses through multivalent interactions with intracellular post - synaptic scaffolding proteins . Keywords : adhesion molecule , membrane diffusion , single molecule tracking , computer simulation , ﬂuorescence recovery after photo bleaching INTRODUCTION During neuronal development , several adhesion protein families are involved in establishing and maintaining synaptic connections , among which the neurexins ( NRXNs ) and their binding partners neuroligins ( NLGNs ) have been widely studied ( Bemben et al . , 2015 ; Südhof , 2017 ) . These transmembrane molecules are implicated in a variety of extracellular and intracellular protein - protein interactions , including calcium - dependent trans - synaptic binding between NRXN Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 1 April 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 835427 fnsyn - 14 - 835427 April 18 , 2022 Time : 13 : 36 # 2 Lagardère et al . Computing Neuroligin - 1 Dynamics and Organization and NLGN ectodomains ( Levinson and El - Husseini , 2007 ) , cis - interactions with neurexophilin and MDGAs , respectively ( Born et al . , 2014 ; Connor et al . , 2019 ) , and C - terminal binding to PDZ - domain containing scaﬀolding proteins such as CASK and PSD - 95 , respectively ( Irie et al . , 1997 ; Mukherjee et al . , 2008 ) . NRXNs and NLGNs are involved in regulating synaptic diﬀerentiation and potentiation through either direct or indirect connections to pre - synaptic calcium channels and post - synaptic neurotransmitter receptors , respectively ( Missler et al . , 2003 ; Poulopoulos et al . , 2009 ; Shipman et al . , 2011 ; Nguyen et al . , 2016 ; Haas et al . , 2018 ; Letellier et al . , 2018 , 2020 ; Wu et al . , 2019 ) . The large repertoire of protein interactions displayed by NRXNs and NLGNs allows a ﬁne regulation of the membrane traﬃcking and synaptic retention of these molecules . Indeed , both NRXNs and NLGNs were shown by single molecule tracking to be highly dynamic in the neuronal plasma membrane , and transiently trapped at synapses through a combination of extracellular and intracellular protein interactions ( Neupert et al . , 2015 ; Chamma et al . , 2016a ; Klatt et al . , 2021 ) . Synaptic conﬁnement of these molecules increases as synapses mature during neuronal development ( Chamma et al . , 2016a ) , and super - resolution microscopy investigation in mature synapses showed that NRXN and NLGN form small conﬁnement domains facing each other on both sides of the synaptic cleft ( Chamma et al . , 2016a , b ; Trotter et al . , 2019 ) . Despite these advances , the molecular mechanisms that regulate the surface dynamics , synaptic anchorage and nanoscale localization of NLGNs , are still unclear . Part of the diﬃculty in interpreting NLGN surface dynamics or localization data arises from the various imaging techniques used i . e . , Single Particule Tracking ( SPT ) , ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) , which are often performed at diﬀerent protein expression levels , probe labeling density , and recording time scales . To address these limitations , we provide here a detailed quantitative description of the membrane dynamics and nanoscale distribution of NLGN1 in neurons , by correlating imaging experiments and computer simulations . We previously applied such a modeling approach to evaluate the mechanisms controlling AMPA receptor traﬃcking at synapses ( Czöndör et al . , 2012 ) . In this study , we took advantage of our recently released simulator of membrane protein dynamics , FluoSim , that was thoroughly validated against live - cell and super - resolution imaging experiments performed on lamellipodial contacts mediated by NRXN - NLGN adhesions in heterologous cells ( Lagardère et al . , 2020 ) . We extended this analysis to model NLGN1 dynamics and organization in the neuronal membrane , with a systematic comparison to single molecule tracking and localization studies , as well as long - term FRAP experiments performed in primary hippocampal neurons . This approach allowed us to unify the diﬀerent imaging paradigms within a single framework using a small set of parameters , i . e . , diﬀusion coeﬃcients outside and inside synapses , as well as binding and unbinding constants to synaptic scaﬀolds , and photophysical rates . Overall , we oﬀer a simulation package of NLGN1 dynamics at the single molecule and ensemble levels , that closely matches actual imaging data and can be further used to model other types of experiments and / or to adjust labeling conditions and microscopy settings . RESULTS Diffusional Trapping of NLGN1 at Synapses To characterize NLGN1 dynamics in the dendritic membrane , we ﬁrst experimentally tracked single recombinant surface NLGN1 molecules in dissociated rat hippocampal neurons using universal Point Acquisition In Nanoscale Topography ( uPAINT ) ( Giannone et al . , 2010 ) . To detect NLGN1 at near - endogenous levels we electroporated neurons with shRNA against NLGN1 , resulting in a 70 % knock - down of native NLGN1 within 2 weeks ( Chamma et al . , 2016a ) , and replaced it with a rescue construct bearing a 15 - aa N - terminal acceptor peptide ( AP ) tag which is biotinylated upon the co - expression of the biotin ligase BirA ER ( Howarth et al . , 2005 ) . Neurons also expressed Homer1c - DsRed as a post - synaptic marker ( Kuriu et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 1A ) . Biotinylated AP - NLGN1 at the cell surface was then detected by sparse labeling with STAR635P - conjugated monomeric streptavidin ( mSA ) ( Demonte et al . , 2013 ; Chamma et al . , 2016a ) , upon oblique illumination from a 647 nm laser ( Figure 1C ) . Single molecule trajectories were reconstructed oﬄine ( Figure 1E ) , and their diﬀusion coeﬃcient was calculated and plotted on a logarithmic scale . The global distribution of diﬀusion coeﬃcients for AP - NLGN1 was rather broad , but showed two clear peaks : i ) a fast diﬀusing population ( mostly corresponding to extra - synaptic NLGN1 molecules ) which peaked at 0 . 15 µ m 2 / s , and a population corresponding to more conﬁned synaptic molecules with diﬀusion coeﬃcient peaking at 0 . 006 µ m 2 / s ) ( Figure 1G ) . When comparing neurons between days in vitro ( DIV ) 10 and 14 , the fraction of highly mobile NLGN1 molecules decreased to the beneﬁt of conﬁned molecules , most likely reﬂecting the formation and / or maturation of synapses that occurs during that time frame ( Chanda et al . , 2017 ) . Independently of neuronal age , a 20 % fraction of immobile molecules was also detected and placed at D = 10 − 5 µ m 2 / s . This value is comparable to that obtained with antibodies to AMPA receptors in similar imaging conditions ( Nair et al . , 2013 ) , and might correspond to a variety of processes , including receptor endocytosis during live labeling , connection to the underlying cytoskeleton , and some degree of non - speciﬁc binding of the dye - conjugated probes to the cell surface . Introducing Biophysical Parameters in FluoSim FluoSim is an interactive simulator of membrane protein dynamics for ﬂuorescence live - cell and super - resolution imaging ( SRI ) techniques ( Lagardère et al . , 2020 ) . The program calculates in real time the localization and intensity of thousands of independent molecules in 2D cellular geometries , providing simulated data directly comparable to actual experiments . FluoSim requires several inputs : ( 1 ) a realistic cellular geometry deﬁned from a microscopy image , comprising potential sub - compartments with speciﬁc trapping properties ; ( 2 ) a given Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 2 April 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 835427 fnsyn - 14 - 835427 April 18 , 2022 Time : 13 : 36 # 3 Lagardère et al .

The diffusion color code in logarithmic scale applies to both E and F panels . ( G , H ) Semi - log distribution of NLGN1 diffusion coefﬁcients obtained by experiment and simulation , respectively . The experimental data is the average distribution of 13 and 9 neurons at DIV 10 and 14 , respectively , the number of trajectories analyzed per cell ranging from 949 to 3113 . The simulated data is the average ± sem of 5 independent simulations , with trajectory numbers between 625 and 638 per simulation , generated for two different synapse densities ( 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 synapse / µ m 2 , respectively ) from the same dendritic geometry ( 135 µ m 2 ) . The coefﬁcient χ 2 expressing the goodness of ﬁt between simulated and experimental data was 5 . 6 and 10 . 5 for DIV 10 and 14 neurons , respectively , as calculated from 28 binned values . number of molecules that populates the cellular geometry ; ( 3 ) kinetic parameters ( diﬀusion coeﬃcients , binding and unbinding rates ) characterizing the molecular system of interest ; and ( 4 ) ﬂuorescence photophysical rates related to the experiment to model ( Table 1 ) . To model our experiments in dissociated neurons , we ﬁrst entered in FluoSim a representative dendritic segment of 48 µ m in length , populated by 24 synapses based on the Homer1c - DsRed ﬂuorescence signal ( Figure 1B ) . This represents on average one synapse every 2 µ m , as previously reported in DIV 14 hippocampal cultures ( Czöndör et al . , 2012 ) . In the absence of a priori knowledge of the surface density of recombinant NLGN1 , we ﬁlled the dendritic geometry with an arbitrarily low number of molecules ( i . e . , 2 , 500 for a surface area of 70 µ m 2 ) . The synapse is considered as a trapping element for surface diﬀusing NLGN1 molecules , with excess number of slots based on the large number of scaﬀolding proteins per post - synaptic density ( PSD ) ( > 300 copies ) ( Chen et al . , 2005 ; Sheng and Hoogenraad , 2007 ) . Regarding dynamic properties , NLGN1 molecules were allowed to diﬀuse relatively fast in the dendritic shaft ( D out = 0 . 15 µ m 2 / s ) , more slowly in the PSD due to steric hindrance ( D in = 0 . 06 µ m 2 / s ) , and very slowly when NLGN1 molecules were considered bound to the PSD ( D trap = 0 . 006 µ m 2 / s ) , based on the experimental peak values described above . We also deﬁned a 20 % fraction of immobile molecules , as found experimentally , that were placed randomly in the dendritic geometry . To take into account the fact that the synaptic cleft is a narrow cell - cell junction ( Tanaka et al . , 2012 ) , where large molecules such as NLGN1 can have some diﬃculty to access , we also introduced in FluoSim a parameter called “crossing probability” ( P crossing = 0 . 6 ) that represents the fraction of molecules allowed to enter the synapse through diﬀusion , based on our previous estimate of NRXN1 β penetration in cell – cell contacts ( Lagardère et al . , 2020 ) .

Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 3 April 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 835427 fnsyn - 14 - 835427 April 18 , 2022 Time : 13 : 36 # 4 Lagardère et al . Computing Neuroligin - 1 Dynamics and Organization To model the transitions between bound and unbound states , we introduced kinetic rates ( k on and k oﬀ ) as global parameters that characterize the dynamic trapping of NLGN1 at synapses through both extracellular and intracellular interactions . The reference values that describe the extracellular interaction between NLGN1 and NRXN1 β are in the range of k on = 0 . 15 s − 1 and k oﬀ = 0 . 015 s − 1 ( Comoletti et al . , 2003 ; Saint - Michel et al . , 2009 ; Lagardère et al . , 2020 ) . However , to match the FRAP experiments performed on AP - NLGN1 or NLGN1 - GFP at synapses ( Chamma et al . , 2016a ) ( also see below ) , we had to choose interaction rates 30 – 150 fold lower ( k on = 0 , 0008 s − 1 and k oﬀ = 0 . 0005 s − 1 ) . This ﬁnding indicates that NLGN1 is not solely retained at synapses through its trans - synaptic binding to NRXNs , but also forms long - lived bonds with the post - synaptic scaﬀold , and that the combination of these extracellular and intracellular interactions overall contributes to very low kinetic rates . The molecular enrichment , deﬁned as the ratio between NLGN1 accumulated at PSDs versus NLGN1 present in the shaft , is theoretically given by the formula ( P crossing D out / D in ) ( 1 + k on / k oﬀ ) ( Lagardère et al . , 2020 ) , and is slightly lowered by the presence of immobile NLGN1 that are placed randomly . Given the chosen parameters , the synaptic enrichment of NLGN1 is predicted to be around 3 . 5 , close to values measured earlier ( Chamma et al . , 2016a ; Toledo et al . , 2022 ) . With respect to photophysical parameters , we deﬁned a ﬂuorescence switch - on rate ( k ON Fluo = 0 . 03 s − 1 ) that mimics the stochastic binding of the mSA probe in uPAINT so as to match the average surface density of emitting ﬂuorophores ( 0 . 6 / µ m 2 ) per time frame ( (cid:49) t = 20 ms ) , which is considered as constant . Note that in the absence of knowledge about the actual number of NLGN1 molecules in the neuronal membrane ( see direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( dSTORM ) experiments below ) , this value is somewhat arbitrary since the parameter k ONFluo is inversely related to the surface density of molecules introduced in the geometry , i . e . , if we placed more molecules we would have to choose a lower k ONFluo and vice versa . Besides , we set a ﬂuorescence switch - oﬀ rate ( k OFFFluo = 5 . 4 s − 1 ) characterizing the photobleaching rate of the dye STAR635P in the experimental laser excitation conditions , as calculated from the exponential distribution of trajectory durations ( mean 0 . 9 ± 0 . 02 s , n = 6314 traces ) . We also introduced realistic single molecule ﬂuorescence rendering parameters for STAR635P ( σ = 0 . 22 µ m , FWHM = 0 . 53 µ m ) ( Figure 1D ) . Modeling NLGN1 Diffusive and Conﬁned Behaviors We then performed SPT simulations of the same duration as for uPAINT experiments ( 2000 frames = 40 s ) , and analyzed the trajectories of virtual single molecules with the SPT Analysis menu in FluoSim . Using these parameters , FluoSim generated trajectory maps that mimicked experimental ones with clear conﬁnement events inside synapses ( Figure 1F ) , and global diﬀusion coeﬃcient distributions that aligned well on the two experimental peaks ( Figure 1H ) . Experimental distributions were somewhat more spread than theoretical ones , most likely because of local membrane heterogeneities that can contribute to NLGN1 conﬁnement outside synapses , and / or more complex binding kinetics which are not accounted for in the model . To estimate the inﬂuence of the model parameters on the balance between mobile and conﬁned NLGN1 populations ( characterized by the relative peaks at D out = 0 . 15 µ m 2 / s and D trap = 0 . 006 µ m 2 / s , respectively ) , we ran a series of simulations by individually varying D in , k on , or k oﬀ , while adjusting P crossing so as to keep a constant NLGN1 synaptic enrichment ( Supplementary Figures 1 , 2 ) . The fraction of conﬁned NLGN1 molecules increased at the expense of fast - diﬀusing molecules with increasing k on or decreasing k oﬀ , i . e . , either way by enhancing the trapping aﬃnity . Changing D in did not inﬂuence much the ratio between conﬁned and mobile NLGN1 molecules , most likely because the fraction of freely diﬀusing molecules in synapses is small compared to bound ones . To evaluate the impact of changing synapse density on the histograms of NLGN1 diﬀusion coeﬃcients , we kept the same dendritic geometry but varied the number of active PSDs able to trap NLGN1 ( from 0 to 24 ) , while keeping the other parameters as constant ( Supplementary Figures 1 , 2 ) . This is supposed to mimic the eﬀect of neuronal development , where the number of synapses increases with time in culture ( Czöndör et al . , 2012 ; Chanda et al . , 2017 ) . The simulations show that the fraction of conﬁned NLGN1 molecules increases signiﬁcantly with synapse density , independently of changes in binding kinetics . This result indicates that the increase in overall NLGN1 conﬁnement observed between DIV 10 and 14 might be solely due to an increase in synapse number , and not necessarily to a change in the trapping properties of the PSD . Interestingly , those data show that although NLGN1 is enriched at synapses , a large reservoir of NLGN1 ( > 50 % ) stays mobile in the dendritic shaft . Transient Conﬁnement Domains of NLGN1 at Synapses In addition to providing an estimation of diﬀusion coeﬃcients , uPAINT experiments can also be used to generate localization maps representing the sum of all single molecules detected over the acquisition period . For molecules that diﬀuse fast in the extra - synaptic space , the localization distribution is spread over a cloud of individual points , whereas for molecules that are dynamically trapped at synapses and in the dendritic shaft , the localization map forms “hot spots” that represent transient conﬁnement domains ( Figures 2A , C ) . The size of these domains depends on the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the molecule trapped in the synapse , the potential movement of the PSD during the acquisition period ( a process called “morphing” ; Blanpied et al . , 2008 ) , and the localization precision of the optical system . As a rule of thumb , the characteristic radius r of such domains obeys the following equation : < r 2 > = 4 D trap τ ON , where D trap is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of NLGN1 molecules trapped at synapses ( in the order of 6 × 10 − 3 µ m 2 / s ) and τ ON is the time during which an mSA probe emits ﬂuorescence in uPAINT illumination conditions ( t ON = 1 / k OFFFluo = 200 ms ) . Thus , r is in the range of 69 nm . As determined experimentally , the size of the NLGN1 conﬁnement domains was 87 ± 2 nm ( mean ± SEM , n = 688 clusters from 2 neurons ) ( Figure 2E ) , close to this theoretical estimate . To model the formation of such NLGN1 conﬁnement domains , we uploaded FluoSim with the Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 4 April 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 835427 fnsyn - 14 - 835427 April 18 , 2022 Time : 13 : 36 # 5 Lagardère et al .

( E , F ) Distribution of the size ( FWHM ) of the NLGN1 conﬁnement domains obtained by experiment and simulation , respectively . The experimental and simulated distributions of domain sizes were compared by a non - parametric Mann – Whitney test ( non - signiﬁcant difference , P - value = 0 . 74 ) . same set of parameters as above , and generated super - resolved maps integrating all single molecule detections throughout a live uPAINT sequence of 2 , 000 frames , using a zoom of 5 with respect to original images ( pixel size 32 nm ) and a localization precision σ = 25 nm ( FWHM = 58 nm ) . This approach resulted in the clear visualization of conﬁnement domains localized at the PSD where NLGN1 molecules get trapped ( Figures 2B , D ) . The size of the domains was on average 92 ± 2 nm ( n = 541 clusters from 12 simulations ) , with a statistically similar distribution as the one determined experimentally ( Figure 2F ) . Long Term Turnover of NLGN1 at Synapses To characterize the long term turnover of NLGN1 at synapses , we performed FRAP experiments using a NLGN1 construct bearing an intracellular GFP tag located just below the transmembrane domain ( Dresbach et al . , 2004 ) . The NLGN1 - GFP protein accumulated at synapses almost as well as AP - NLGN1 labeled with mSA ( Chamma et al . , 2016a ) ( i . e . , synaptic enrichment = 3 . 1 ± 0 . 2 , n = 32 synapses from nine neurons ) . When photobleaching was performed on synaptic NLGN1 - GFP , there was a fast initial 20 % recovery that likely corresponds to diﬀusional exchange , followed by a slower almost linear phase that reached 50 % recovery in 30 min , which reﬂects the continuous binding and unbinding of NLGN1 at the synapse ( Figures 3A , C ) . Control unbleached synapses did not display any signiﬁcant drop in NLGN1 - GFP ﬂuorescence , revealing negligible observational photobleaching . Additional FRAP experiments with a lower sampling rate in neurons co - expressing NLGN1 - GFP and Xph20 - mRuby2 , an intrabody speciﬁc to PSD - 95 ( Rimbault et al . , 2019 , 2021 ) , showed that photobleached NLGN1 - GFP was essentially post - synaptic ( Supplementary Figure 3A ) . Furthermore , the NLGN1 - GFP ﬂuorescence recovery after 1 h was 60 % , a value in line with the ﬁrst round of experiments performed at higher sampling rate ( Supplementary Figures 3B , C ) . To mimic FRAP experiments , we introduced a large number of molecules in the simulator ( 25 , 000 copies for a dendritic region of 135 µ m 2 , corresponding to a surface density of 185 molecules / µ m 2 ) and generated ﬂuorescence - like images by deﬁning a Gaussian intensity proﬁle for each GFP - tagged molecule ( σ = 0 . 17 µ m , FWHM = 0 . 47 µ m ) ( Figure 3B ) . To induce local photo - bleaching , we chose a bleaching rate ( 4 . 0 s − 1 ) reproducing the initial drop of ﬂuorescence observed experimentally ( ∼ 75 % in 500 ms ) . We then entered the NLGN1 extra - synaptic and synaptic diﬀusion coeﬃcients ( D out and D trap ) previously obtained from SPT data . We ran a series of simulations by individually varying D in , k on , or k oﬀ , while adjusting P crossing so as to keep a constant NLGN1 synaptic enrichment of 3 . 5 ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . D in had mild eﬀect on the simulated FRAP curve , i . e . , increasing D in slightly moved up the long term slope of the FRAP curve ( Supplementary Figure 4C ) . Increasing k on essentially reduced the fast recovering fraction , without changing much the long term slope ( Supplementary Figure 4D ) . In contrast , increasing k oﬀ dramatically accelerated the whole FRAP curve ( Supplementary Figure 4E ) . Based on these simulated curves , we chose the best pair of coeﬃcients that matched the experimental 30 min FRAP curve , i . e . , k oﬀ = 0 . 0005 s − 1 and k on = 0 . 0008 s − 1 , as well as intermediate values D in = 0 . 06 µ m 2 / s and P crossing = 0 . 6 ( Figure 3C ) , by minimizing a least squares function ( Supplementary Figure 4F ) . The simulated curves also ﬁt very well the 1 h FRAP experiment performed at lower sampling rate ( Supplementary Figures 3B , C ) . With these parameters , the simulated images at steady state predicted NLGN1 enrichment in the post - synapse that matched experimental values ( 3 . 25 ± 0 . 05 , n = 18 simulations ) ( unpaired t - test , no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 5 April 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 835427 fnsyn - 14 - 835427 April 18 , 2022 Time : 13 : 36 # 6 Lagardère et al .

( A ) Representative time sequence of a FRAP experiment performed on a neuron expressing NLGN1 - GFP . The GFP signal is color coded in gold to better visualize intensity changes over time .

( B ) Corresponding simulated FRAP sequence . The dendritic geometry of 135 µ m 2 was ﬁlled with 25 , 000 individual molecules , each with a realistic point spread function , together providing a ﬂuorescence - like image that is also color coded in gold . The ﬂuorescence intensity of molecules inside two PSDs was decreased by 75 % at time zero ( arrows ) , mimicking the action of the laser . ( C ) Normalized FRAP curves obtained by experiment ( open circles ) in bleached synapses ( red , mean ± SEM of 25 synapses from 4 neurons ) or unbleached synapses ( green , mean ± SEM of 11 synapses from 4 neurons ) and corresponding simulations ( solid curves , average of 10 repetitions each , SEM < 1 % mean , not shown ) . The Spearman correlation coefﬁcient between experimental and simulated data for bleached synapses was 0 . 98 , while the parameter χ 2 estimating the goodness of ﬁt was 0 . 05 , both values being calculated out of 100 time points . experiment and simulation , P = 0 . 6 ) . Thus , whereas uPAINT provides precise estimates of NLGN1 diﬀusion coeﬃcients outside and inside synapses , FRAP experiments together with the measurement of NLGN1 synaptic enrichment allow for a determination of long - term trapping rates . Overall , the combination of single molecule and ensemble measurements oﬀers a consistent set of parameters to model NLGN1 dynamics within the same framework . Nanoscale Organization of NLGN1 at Synapses To characterize the nanoscale organization of NLGN1 in the neuronal membrane and get access to the number of NLGN1 molecules in synapses , we performed dSTORM experiments on neurons expressing shRNA to NLGN1 plus rescue AP - NLGN1 ( Figure 4A ) . Biotinylated AP - NLGN1 was densely labeled with Alexa647 - conjugated mSA in live conditions , followed by ﬁxation , and the stochastic emission of single ﬂuorophores was induced ( Figures 4C , E ) . When super - resolved images were reconstructed from individual detections , NLGN1 ﬁlled PSDs labeled with the Xph20 - GFP intrabody to PSD - 95 ( Rimbault et al . , 2019 , 2021 ) without forming any speciﬁc sub - domain ( Figures 4G , I ) , as previously reported ( Chamma et al . , 2016a ) . In the dendritic shaft , NLGN1 showed a fairly homogeneous membrane localization , likely corresponding to the fast - diﬀusing molecules detected live by uPAINT . To simulate stochastic ﬂuorescence emission of Alexa647 dyes ( Dempsey et al . , 2011 ) , we ﬁrst calculated the switch - on rate ( k ONFluo = 0 . 004 s − 1 ) and switch - oﬀ rate ( k OFFFluo = 6 . 3 s − 1 ) of isolated substrate - bound mSA - Alexa647 probes in dSTORM imaging conditions ( Supplementary Figure 5 ; Lagardère et al . , 2020 ) . To estimate the number of Alexa647 dyes conjugated per mSA , we counted the photobleaching steps of single substrate - bound mSA - Alexa647 molecules in Tyrode solution ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . We visualized essentially one or two photobleaching steps , corresponding to an average of 1 . 26 Alexa dyes per mSA , in agreement with a 1 . 3 degree of labeling ( DOL ) separately measured by spectroscopy . To reproduce dSTORM experiments performed on AP - NLGN1 labeled with mSA - Alexa647 , we then introduced in the imported geometry of surface area 118 µ m 2 ( Figure 4B ) the number of mSA molecules corresponding to the average number of experimental detections per frame ( 13 . 3 ) ( Figures 4C – F ) divided by the on - oﬀ duty cycle of mSA - Alexa647 ( 0 . 0006 ) , giving a total of 19 , 843 mSA molecules ( surface density = 167 molecules / µ m 2 ) . After an equilibration period allowing NLGN1 molecules to accumulate at synapses with kinetic rates k on = 0 . 0008 s − 1 and k oﬀ = 0 . 0005 s − 1 as validated from FRAP experiments , we further set all diﬀusion coeﬃcients to zero to mimic cell ﬁxation . We then simulated the accumulation of single molecule localizations for 40 , 000 frames , including a realistic localization precision ( σ = 25 nm , FWHM = 58 nm ) , to mimic the experimental super - resolved maps of NLGN1 distribution ( Figures 4H , J ) . As expected , the overall number of single molecule detections obtained in simulations precisely matched experimental ones , thereby validating the measurement of photo - physical parameters made in parallel . In addition , simulated images faithfully reproduced the nanoscale distribution of NLGN1 outside and inside synapses observed experimentally ( Figures 4G – J ) , and gave NLGN1 synaptic enrichment values ( 3 . 10 ± 0 . 08 , n = 44 PSDs , two Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 6 April 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 835427 fnsyn - 14 - 835427 April 18 , 2022 Time : 13 : 36 # 7 Lagardère et al . Computing Neuroligin - 1 Dynamics and Organization dendritic segments ) similar to experimental ones ( 3 . 24 ± 0 . 12 , n = 111 PSDs , ﬁve dendritic segments ) . Interestingly , we could then use the density of virtual molecules introduced in the model ( 19 , 843 mSA copies spread over the 118 µ m 2 dendritic area ) as a reference to predict the average copy number of mSA molecules bound to NLGN1 at steady state in each synapse . To this aim , we just generated a single frame snapshot in the super - resolution imaging ( SRI ) menu of FluoSim , setting the photophysical parameters k ONFluo = 10 s − 1 and k OFFFluo = 0 s − 1 so as to make all ﬂuorophores visible , then counted the number of molecules per PSD ( n = 272 ± 20 , n = 44 PSDs from two dendritic segments ) . DISCUSSION In summary , we provide here a detailed description of the surface traﬃcking of NLGN1 in the dendritic membrane by interpreting ﬂuorescence live - cell and super - resolution imaging experiments using a quantitative computer software , FluoSim ( Lagardère et al . , 2020 ) . The advantage of this correlative approach is that diﬀerent imaging paradigms can be modeled using a small set of dynamic and photophysical parameters . Interestingly , each technique is used to feed the program with critical parameters that are not easily accessible with other imaging methods . We give a schematic overview of our strategy to estimate one by one the parameters entered in the simulator ( Supplementary Figure 7 ) . Speciﬁcally , single molecule tracking ( uPAINT ) provides precise mean values of NLGN1 diﬀusion coeﬃcients inside and outside synapses , but because of the short duration of the trajectories , fails to capture the long - term residence time of NLGN1 in PSDs . In contrast , FRAP gives a single curve whose ﬁt includes several unknown dynamic coeﬃcients , but when combined with the calculation of the synaptic enrichment of NLGN1 and the diﬀusion coeﬃcients inferred from uPAINT , the long range recovery provides estimates of the binding and unbinding rates of NLGN1 to the PSD scaﬀold . Finally , dSTORM yields static super - resolution maps of NLGN1 distribution in the dendritic membrane that can be faithfully reproduced by ﬁlling the model with a high density of molecules made immobile to mimic chemical ﬁxation , after an equilibration period to reach steady - state distribution . Strikingly , by considering the photophysics of the Alexa647 - conjugated mSA probe , the interpretation of dSTORM sequences by FluoSim provides an estimate of the molecular density of NLGN1 in the neuronal membrane , and hence of NLGN1 copy number in single PSDs . We thereby calculate that a PSD contains on average 272 mSA molecules bound to NLGN1 . Although mSA has four potential NHS conjugation sites ( N - terminus plus 3 accessible lysine residues ) ( Chamma et al . , 2017 ) , such that each mSA molecule may carry a diﬀerent number of ﬂuorophores ( from zero to 4 ) , we made sure to use an mSA preparation in which the average number of Alexa647 dyes was close to 1 ( DOL = 1 . 3 ) . In any case , the DOL should not inﬂuence much the photophysical rates in dSTORM , as reported for antibodies with up to eight conjugated Alexa647 dyes ( Sauer et al . , 2020 ) . Further assuming that both NLGN1 subunits are biotinylated and that each one binds an mSA probe , we estimate the presence of ∼ 136 NLGN1 dimers per PSD . We can moderate this number by almost a factor of two by considering the fact that , despite our NLGN1 replacement strategy , the rescue construct is most likely over - expressed by two - fold over endogenous NLGN1 ( Chamma et al . , 2016a ; Toledo et al . , 2022 ) . In addition , according to the kinetic parameters of the model , only a 70 % fraction of synaptic NLGN1 is actually bound to the PSD , while the other 30 % fraction is free to diﬀuse in the synapse . This ﬁnally yields a value of 48 NLGN1 dimers bound to the PSD , which is 6 – 10 fold lower than the estimated number of PSD - 95 proteins that can accommodate NLGN1 anchoring at PSDs ( between 300 and 500 ) ( Chen et al . , 2005 ; Sheng and Hoogenraad , 2007 ) , especially considering that other PDZ - domain containing proteins such as PSD - 93 , SAP - 97 , SAP - 102 , and S - SCAM can also bind NLGN1 through its C - terminal PDZ domain binding motif ( Irie et al . , 1997 ; Hirao et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , our model hypothesis that the number of PSD binding slots is in excess of NLGN1 molecules should be valid . Based on published crystal structures ( Araç et al . , 2007 ; Fabrichny et al . , 2007 ; Chen et al . , 2008 ) , a NLGN1 dimer is likely to occupy a projected area of 5 nm × 12 nm = 60 nm 2 in the plasma membrane , while a typical PSD has a surface area of roughly 350 nm × 350 nm , i . e . , 122 , 000 nm 2 ( Sheng and Hoogenraad , 2007 ) . Thus , 48 NLGN1 molecules would represent 2 , 880 nm 2 / 122 , 000 nm 2 = 2 . 4 % of the PSD area which is a reasonable number and leaves room to many other membrane molecules including lipids , adhesion proteins , and neurotransmitter receptors ( Chen et al . , 2005 ; Lowenthal et al . , 2015 ) . In comparison , a recent proteomics study provides an estimate of 21 NLGN3 molecules per PSD ( Lowenthal et al . , 2015 ) , which is in the same order of magnitude especially considering that NLGN3 are present at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses ( Budreck and Scheiﬀele , 2007 ) . The rate constants k on and k oﬀ introduced in the model are pooled parameters that represent the overall anchorage of NLGN1 to the synapse , taking into consideration multiple protein - protein interactions , including the extracellular binding of NLGN1 to pre - synaptic NRXNs ( Dean et al . , 2003 ) , and the intracellular binding to scaﬀolding proteins , e . g . , PDZ domain containing proteins such as PSD - 95 ( Irie et al . , 1997 ; Mondin et al . , 2011 ) , and potentially other non - canonical binding partners ( Shipman et al . , 2011 ) . Fitting our FRAP data indicates that NLGN1 dissociates very slowly from the synapse , potentially due to the formation of parallel interactions between dimeric NLGN1 and PDZ domain containing scaﬀolding proteins . In any case , the calculated dissociation rate k oﬀ is two orders of magnitude lower that the dissociation rate between puriﬁed NLGN1 and NRXN1 β ( Comoletti et al . , 2003 ) , indicating that extracellular NRXN - NLGN interactions are not alone responsible for NLGN1 retention at the synapse . The corresponding association rate k on calculated by further ﬁtting experimental NLGN1 synaptic enrichment values was also much lower than the value previously found by quantifying the detachment rate of NRXN1 β - Fc coated Quantum dots from the surface of neurons over - expressing NLGN1 ( Saint - Michel et al . , 2009 ) , or from FRAP experiments performed on GFP - NRXN1 β accumulated at contacts with COS - 7 cells expressing NLGN1 - mCherry ( Lagardère et al . , 2020 ) . This ﬁnding indicates that the kinetic rate k on increases Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 7 April 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 835427 fnsyn - 14 - 835427 April 18 , 2022 Time : 13 : 36 # 8 Lagardère et al .

( J ) Simulated heat map images showing the low and high resolution images of NLGN1 accumulation in the PSDs of the same spine . The color code for the number of single molecule localizations per pixel applies to the right images of both panels ( I , J ) . with NLGN1 expression level , as expected from a ligand - receptor reaction . A precise evaluation of the contribution of each of these protein interactions to the actual residence time of NLGN1 at synapses will require a complete structure - function analysis of the dynamics and organization of NLGN1 mutants unable to bind speciﬁc partners . In this direction , our preliminary experiments indicate that GPI - anchored NLGN1 exhibits a diﬀuse localization in the dendritic membrane with no particular enrichment at post - synapses ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the NLGN1 intracellular domain is essential for the synaptic retention of NLGN1 . In addition , knocking down MDGAs as endogenous competitors of NRXN - NLGN adhesion in hippocampal neurons increases the density of excitatory synapses and reduces global NLGN1 diﬀusion without signiﬁcantly aﬀecting the accumulation of NLGN1 at PSDs ( Toledo et al . , 2022 ) , further suggesting that the binding of NLGN1 to NRXNs does not play a major role in the synaptic retention of NLGN1 . Together , these results reinforce our concept that the NLGN1 intracellular domain plays a critical role in excitatory synapse diﬀerentiation ( Shipman et al . , 2011 ; Haas et al . , 2018 ; Letellier et al . , 2018 , 2020 ) .

Computing Neuroligin - 1 Dynamics and Organization actin network underlying the plasma membrane ( Han et al . , 2017 ) e . g . , through the WAVE regulatory complex ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) , might be responsible for the transient conﬁnement of NLGN1 in dendritic sub - domains , that was not described by our model which focuses on the selective trapping of NLGN1 at PSDs . In addition to providing a quantitative interpretation for biological data , the simulation approach described here allows a better understanding of some subtle experimental ﬁndings linked to SRI . For example , the projection of all individual molecule detections obtained in uPAINT provides a super - resolved image where hot spots of protein localization appear , corresponding to the conﬁnement domains of a subset of molecules . Because of the live imaging conditions and the intrinsic movement of synapses , the localization of these domains can evolve over time ( Nair et al . , 2013 ) . These objects are thus diﬀerent from the static protein “nanodomains” that can be identiﬁed from stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) or dSTORM images acquired after saturating protein labeling and chemical ﬁxation ( Nair et al . , 2013 ; Chamma et al . , 2016a , b ; Tang et al . , 2016 ; Hruska et al . , 2018 ) . Things can be complicated even more by the existence of synapses containing multiple PSDs ( Hruska et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , care must be taken in interpreting super - resolution images , and computer simulations can be helpful to put realistic values on the numbers of labeled molecules , the photophysical parameters behind single molecule ﬂuorescence emission peaks , and the time frame of the acquisition sequences , that are all susceptible to aﬀect the actual representation of the imaging data . Finally , one limitation of FluoSim is that it is currently constrained to the simulation of 2D images , while the actual dynamics of membrane molecules including NLGN1 takes place in more complex 3D geometries such as the surface of a dendrite . Theoretical analyses have been published that estimate the error made by approximating 3D diﬀusion by a 2D diﬀusion coeﬃcient ( Renner et al . , 2011 ) . This type of correction might be applied while waiting for a 3D version of the simulator in combination with 3D single molecule tracking of NLGN1 . MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA Plasmids and Proteins shRNA to NLGN1 ( Chih et al . , 2005 ) containing a GFP reporter was a gift from P . Scheiﬀele ( Biozentrum , Basel , Switzerland ) . shRNA to NLGN1 containing a BFP reporter was described earlier ( Toledo et al . , 2022 ) . NLGN1 with GFP insertion at position 728 below the transmembrane domain ( Dresbach et al . , 2004 ) was a gift from T . Dresbach ( University Medical Center , Göttingen , Germany ) . AP - NLGN1 and BirA ER ( Howarth et al . , 2005 ) were gifts from A . Ting ( Stanford University , Palo Alto , CA , United States ) . Homer1c - DsRed was described earlier ( Mondin et al . , 2011 ) . shRNA - resistant AP - NLGN1 was described earlier ( Chamma et al . , 2016a ; Toledo et al . , 2022 ) . The speciﬁc intrabody to PSD - 95 , Xph20 ( Addgene ID 135530 ) was described recently ( Rimbault et al . , 2019 , 2021 ) , and we used both GFP - and mRuby - tagged versions . The bacterial production of mSA , puriﬁcation , and conjugation to organic dyes ( STAR635P or Alexa647 ) to a ﬁnal DOL comprised between 0 . 6 and 2 ( dye to protein ratio ) , were described previously ( Chamma et al . , 2017 ) . Rat Hippocampal Cultures and Electroporation Gestant Sprague - Dawley rat females were purchased from Janvier Labs ( Saint - Berthevin , France ) . Animals were handled and killed according to European ethical rules . Dissociated neuronal cultures were prepared from E18 rat embryos as previously described ( Kaech and Banker , 2006 ) . Dissociated cells were electroporated with the Amaxa system ( Lonza , Basel , Switzerland ) using 300 , 000 cells per cuvette . The following plasmid combinations were used . For uPAINT : Homer1c - DsRed : shNLGN1 - GFP : AP - NLGN1rescue : BirA ER ( 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 µ g DNA ) . For dSTORM : Xph20 - GFP : shNLGN1 - EBFP : AP - NLGN1rescue : BirA ER ( 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 µ g DNA ) . For FRAP , NLGN1 - GFP ( 3 µ g DNA ) or NLGN1 - GFP : Xph20 - mRuby2 ( 1 : 1 µ g DNA ) . Electroporated neurons were resuspended in Minimal Essential Medium ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Illkirch , France # 21090 . 022 ) supplemented with 10 % Horse serum ( Invitrogen , Illkirch , France ) ( MEM - HS ) , and plated on 18 mm glass coverslips coated with 1 mg / mL polylysine ( Sigma - Aldrich , Saint - Quentin - Fallavier , France # P2636 ) overnight at 37 ◦ C . Three hours after plating , coverslips were ﬂipped onto 60 mm dishes containing 15 DIV rat hippocampal glial cells cultured in Neurobasal plus medium ( Gibco , Illkirch , France , # A3582901 ) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 1x B27 TM plus Neuronal supplement ( Gibco , Illkirch , France , # A3582801 ) . Neurons were cultured during 10 – 14 days at 37 ◦ C and 5 % CO 2 . Astrocyte feeder layers were prepared from the same embryos , plated between 20 , 000 and 40 , 000 cells per 60 mm dish previously coated with 0 . 1 mg / mL polylysine and cultured for 14 days in MEM containing 4 . 5 g / L glucose , 2 mM L - glutamax ( Sigma - Aldrich , Saint - Quentin - Fallavier , France # 3550 - 038 ) and 10 % horse serum . Ara C ( Sigma - Aldrich , Saint - Quentin - Fallavier , France # C1768 ) was added after 3 DIV at a ﬁnal concentration of 3 . 4 µ M . Single Molecule Tracking ( uPAINT Experiments ) Universal point accumulation in nanoscale topography ( uPAINT ) was carried out as reported ( Giannone et al . , 2010 ; Chamma et al . , 2016a ) . Neurons at DIV 10 or 14 were mounted in Tyrode solution ( 15 mM D - glucose , 108 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 and 25 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ) containing 1 % globulin - free BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich , Saint - Quentin - Fallavier , France , # A7638 ) in an open Inox observation chamber ( Life Imaging Services , Basel , Switzerland ) . The chamber was placed on a motorized inverted microscope ( Nikon Ti - E Eclipse ) equipped with perfect focus system and an APO TIRF 100x / 1 . 49 NA oil immersion objective , and enclosed in a thermostatic box ( Life Imaging Services , Basel , Switzerland ) providing air at 37 ◦ C . Neurons co - expressing shRNA to NLGN1 containing a GFP reporter and Homer1c - DsRed were detected using a mercury lamp ( Nikon Xcite ) and the following ﬁlter sets ( Semrock , Rochester , NY , United States ) : EGFP ( Excitation : FF01 - 472 / 30 ; Dichroic : FF - 495Di02 ; Emission : FF01 - 525 / 30 ) and DsRed ( Excitation : FF01 - 543 / 22 ; Dichroic : FF - 562Di02 ; Emission : FF01 - 593 / 40 ) .

Computing Neuroligin - 1 Dynamics and Organization STAR635P - conjugated mSA ( 1 nM ) . A four - color laser bench ( 405 / 488 / 561 nm lines , 100 mW each ; Roper Scientiﬁc , Evry , France and 1 W 647 nm line , MPB Communications Inc . , Pointe - Claire , QC , Canada ) is connected through an optical ﬁber to the Total Internal Reﬂection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) illumination arm of the microscope . Laser power was controlled through an acousto - optical tunable ﬁlter ( AOTF ) driven by the Metamorph software ( Molecular Devices , San Jose , CA , United States ) . STAR635P was excited with the 647 nm laser line ( ∼ 2 mW at the objective front lens ) , through a four - band beam splitter ( BS R405 / 488 / 561 / 635 , Semrock , Rochester , NY , United States ) . Samples were imaged by oblique laser illumination , allowing the excitation of individual mSA - STAR635P molecules bound to the cell surface , without illuminating probes in solution . Fluorescence was collected on an EMCCD camera with 16 µ m pixel size ( Evolve , Roper Scientiﬁc , Evry , France ) , using a FF01 - 676 / 29 nm emission ﬁlter ( Semrock , Rochester , NY , United States ) . Stacks of 2 , 000 consecutive frames were obtained from each cell with an integration time of 20 ms . Images were analyzed using PALM - Tracer , a program running on Metamorph and based on wavelet segmentation for molecule localization and simulated annealing algorithms for tracking ( generously provided by J . B . Sibarita , Bordeaux ) ( Izeddin et al . , 2012 ) . This program allows for the tracking of localized molecules through successive images . Trajectories longer than 10 frames ( 200 ms ) were selected . The diﬀusion coeﬃcient , D , was calculated for each trajectory , from linear ﬁts of the ﬁrst 4 points of the mean square displacement ( MSD ) function versus time . Trajectories with displacement inferior to the pointing accuracy ( ∼ 50 nm in uPAINT conditions ) whose MSD function cannot be properly ﬁtted are arbitrarily placed at D = 10 − 5 µ m 2 s − 1 . Direct Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy Experiments Neurons co - expressing shRNA to NLGN1 containing an EBFP reporter , Xph20 - GFP , rescue AP - NLGN1 , and BirA ER were surface - labeled with a high concentration ( 100 nM ) of Alexa647 - conjugated mSA in Tyrode solution containing 1 % globulin - free BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich , Saint - Quentin - Fallavier , France , # A7638 ) for 10 min , rinsed and ﬁxed with 4 % PFA - 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature , and stored in PBS at 4 ◦ C until imaging ( within a few days ) . Cells were imaged in Tris - HCl buﬀer ( pH 7 . 5 ) , containing 10 % glycerol , 10 % glucose , 0 . 5 mg / mL glucose oxidase ( Sigma - Aldrich , Saint - Quentin - Fallavier , France , # G2133 ) , 40 mg / mL catalase ( Sigma - Aldrich , Saint - Quentin - Fallavier , France , # C100 - 0 , 1 % w / v ) and 50 mM β - mercaptoethylamine ( MEA ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , Saint - Quentin - Fallavier , France , # M6500 ) ( Heilemann et al . , 2008 ) . The same microscope described for uPAINT was used . Detection of the EBFP reporter was made with the following ﬁlter set from Semrock , Rochester , NY , United States ( Excitation : FF02 - 379 / 34 ; Dichroic : FF - 409Di03 ; Emission : FF01 - 440 / 40 ) . Pumping of Alexa647 dyes into their triplet state was performed for several seconds using ∼ 60 mW of the 647 nm laser at the objective front lens . Then , a lower power ( ∼ 20 mW ) was applied to detect the stochastic emission of single - molecule ﬂuorescence , which was collected using the same optics and detector as described above for uPAINT . 10 streams of 4 , 000 frames each were acquired at 50 Hz . Multi - color 100 - nm ﬂuorescent beads ( Tetraspeck , Invitrogen , Illkirch , France ) were used to register long - term acquisitions and correct for lateral drift . The localization precision of our imaging system in dSTORM conditions is around 60 nm ( FWHM ) . Stacks were analyzed using the PALM - Tracer program , allowing for the reconstruction of a unique super - resolved image of 32 nm pixel size ( zoom 5 compared to the original images ) by summing the intensities of all single molecules localized ( 1 detection per frame is coded by an intensity value of 1 ) . Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching Experiments and Analysis Neurons expressing NLGN1 - GFP were mounted in Tyrode solution , and observed under the same set - up used for uPAINT and dSTORM . The laser bench has a second optical ﬁber output connected to an illumination device containing two x / y galvanometric scanning mirrors ( ILAS , Roper Scientiﬁc , Evry , France ) steered by MetaMorph . It allows precise spatial and temporal control of the focused laser beam at any user - selected region of interest ( ROI ) within the sample for targeted photo - bleaching . Switching between the two ﬁbers for alternating between imaging and bleaching is performed in the ms time range using an AOTF . Oblique illumination was performed using the 491 nm beam at low power ( 0 . 3 mW at the front of the objective ) to image NLGN1 - GFP molecules in the plasma membrane close to the substrate plane . After acquiring a 10 sec baseline at 0 . 5 Hz frame rate , rapid selective photo - bleaching of several synapses was achieved by scanning circular ROIs of diameter 2 µ m at higher laser power ( 3 mW at the objective front lens ) , during 500 ms . Fluorescence recovery was then recorded immediately after the bleach sequence for 30 min . The recording period included three phases with decreasing frame rate ranging from 2 to 0 . 1 Hz . Observational photo - bleaching was kept very low , as assessed by observing control unbleached areas nearby . FRAP curves were obtained by computing the average intensity in the photobleached area , after background subtraction , and normalized between 1 ( baseline ) and 0 ( time zero after photo - bleaching ) . In some experiments performed at lower sampling rate , several synapses from neurons expressing NLGN1 - GFP + Xph20 - mRuby2 were photobleached at time zero , and ﬂuorescence recovery was monitored every 15 min , up to 1 hr . Description of FluoSim Algorithm and Parameters A thorough description of the FluoSim algorithm together with a detailed user manual have been previously published ( Lagardère et al . , 2020 ) . We give below a general outline of the software and the important parameters used in each simulation mode ( SPT , STORM , and FRAP ) . The contour of a 48 µ m - long dendritic segment containing 23 PSDs was drawn in Metamorph using an image of a 14 DIV neuron expressing Homer1c - DsRed , and saved as a region ﬁle .

Computing Neuroligin - 1 Dynamics and Organization and randomly populated with NLGN1 molecules ( 1 , 500 – 25 , 000 copies depending on the experiment to model ) . Those molecules are kept within the dendrite boundaries by introducing rebound conditions . An individual molecule is characterized by its 2D coordinates x and y over time t , and its intensity . The time step (cid:49) t and total duration of the simulations T is set according to the experiment to model ( SPT : (cid:49) t = 20 ms , T = 40 s ; dSTORM : (cid:49) t = 20 ms , T = 800 s ; and FRAP : (cid:49) t = 100 ms , T = 30 – 60 min ) . The initial position of a freely diﬀusing molecule is deﬁned by x ( 0 ) = x 0 and y ( 0 ) = y 0 , taken as random numbers to fall within the dendrite boundaries . The diﬀusion coeﬃcient outside synapses ( D out ) is chosen around 0 . 15 µ m 2 / s , based on SPT data , while synapses are characterized by a lower diﬀusion coeﬃcient ( D in = 0 . 06 µ m 2 / s ) , owing to molecular crowding . An additional coeﬃcient called crossing probability describes the potentially limited penetrability of molecules into the synapse because of steric hindrance ( P crossing = 0 . 5 ) . A 20 % fraction of immobile NLGN1 molecules was observed in uPAINT ( with D = 10 − 5 µ m 2 / s ) and introduced in the program at random positions with zero diﬀusion coeﬃcient . In the synapse , NLGN1 molecules are allowed to bind reversibly to the quasi - static PSD scaﬀold , with ﬁrst order binding and unbinding rates k on and k oﬀ , respectively ( both in s − 1 ) . The k on and k oﬀ values were obtained by ﬁtting FRAP experiments . NLGN1 bound to the PSD was allowed to diﬀuse at a lower diﬀusion coeﬃcient D trap = 0 . 006 µ m 2 / s , reﬂecting slow PSD morphing over time ( Blanpied et al . , 2008 ) . The number of PSD binding sites is assumed to be in excess , such that the binding rate k on is maintained constant throughout the simulations , i . e . , it does not depend on the number of NLGN1 molecules recruited at synapses over time . We further consider a non - discrete distribution of binding sites in the PSD , consistent with our previous observation that NLGN1 does not tend to form nanodomains and ﬁlls the PSD rather uniformly ( Chamma et al . , 2016a ) . Calculation of Positions At each time step , the ( x , y ) coordinates of each molecule are incremented by the distances ( (cid:49) x , (cid:49) y ) , which depend on whether the molecule is outside or inside the synapse , or bound to the PSD . If the molecule is extra - synaptic , it follows a random walk with diﬀusion coeﬃcient D out . The positions x ( t ) and y ( t ) are then incremented at each time step by n x ( 2 D out (cid:49) t ) 1 / 2 and n y ( 2 D out (cid:49) t ) 1 / 2 , respectively , where n x and n y are random numbers generated from a normal distribution with zero mean and variance unity , to account for the stochastic nature of diﬀusion . This ensures that the mean square displacement stays proportional to time , i . e . , < x 2 + y 2 > = 4 D out t . If the adhesion molecule reaches a synapse , it is set to diﬀuse with a lower diﬀusion coeﬃcient D in , with increments n x ( 2 D in (cid:49) t ) 1 / 2 and n y ( 2 D in (cid:49) t ) 1 / 2 . Whenever the molecule resides in the synapse , it is allowed to bind to the PSD only if the probability of coupling in this time interval , P coupl = k on (cid:49) t , is greater than a random number N between 0 and 1 generated from a uniform distribution . If this is not the case , the molecule continues to diﬀuse until both conditions are met , i . e . , the molecule remains in the synapse and the probability of binding is greater than the random number N , diﬀerently chosen at each time increment . Upon binding , NLGN1 is set to diﬀuse with a slow diﬀusion coeﬃcient D trap , thus the positions x ( t ) and y ( t ) are incremented by n x ( 2 D trap (cid:49) t ) 1 / 2 and n y ( 2 D trap (cid:49) t ) 1 / 2 , respectively . NLGN1 stays bound until the probability for dissociation P detach = k oﬀ (cid:49) t , exceeds another random number N (cid:48) . It then binds again or escapes into the extra - synaptic space . An option is proposed in FluoSim to theoretically estimate the steady - state , by placing more molecules in synapses , considering both slower diﬀusion and adhesion . The theoretical NLGN1 synaptic enrichment is then given by the formula ( P crossing × D out / D in ) ( 1 + k on / k oﬀ ) . Molecule Size , Intensity , and Photophysics In addition to its position , each molecule is deﬁned by its size and ﬂuorescence intensity over time . Single molecules are represented either by a discrete point of intensity 1 , or by a Gaussian intensity proﬁle with a peak value directly coded on a 16 - bit gray scale ( 0 - 65535 levels ) , or expressed in photons / sec associated with a conversion rate , or gain , which gives the number of gray levels read on the virtual camera chip per incoming photon . The Gaussian representation comprises an adjustable width σ ( the standard deviation ) in the order of λ / ( 2 × N . A . ) , where λ is the emission wavelength of the ﬂuorophore , and N . A . is the numerical aperture of the objective ( 1 . 49 in our set - up ) . The corresponding FWHM is then equal to 2 σ √ ( 2 . ln2 ) ( Deschout et al . , 2014 ) . In our experiments , we used NLGN1 - GFP : σ GFP = 510 / ( 2 × 1 . 49 ) = 171 nm , and FWHM GFP = 402 nm , STAR635P - conjugated mSA : σ STAR635P = 651 / ( 2 × 1 . 49 ) = 218 nm and FWHM STAR635P = 529 nm , and Alexa647 - conjugated mSA : σ A647 = 668 / ( 2 × 1 . 49 ) = 224 nm and FWHM A647 = 527 nm . Transitions between ON / OFF intensity values are set by two photo - physical parameters : the switch - on rate ( k ONFluo ) and the switch - oﬀ rate ( k OFFFluo ) . These rates are in units of sec − 1 and represent the probabilities per unit of time that a molecule switches from a state where it emits ﬂuorescence , to a state where it does not emit ﬂuorescence , and vice versa . In uPAINT , k ONFluo represents the rate of binding of ﬂuorescent mSA ligand in solution to NLGN1 molecules on the cell surface , which spontaneously appear in the oblique illumination plane , whereas k OFFFluo combines ﬂuorophore photo - bleaching and probe detachment from the cell surface . To mimic a FRAP experiment , k OFF Fluo is set to a high level in a given ROI for a few frames ( 500 ms ) to quickly and irreversibly photo - bleach ﬂuorophores , then recovery is monitored . In dSTORM , k ONFluo represents the frequency of stochastic ﬂuorescence emission , and k OFFFluo the inverse of the lifetime of the ﬂuorescence emission peaks . Single Particle Tracking Simulations To mimic the sparse density of NLGN1 bound to mSA - STAR635P as used in uPAINT experiments , a relatively low number of molecules were introduced in the model cell ( 1 , 500 molecules per dendrite area of 36 µ m 2 , corresponding to a surface density of 42 molecules / µ m 2 ) . The oﬀ - rate of the simulated trajectories was adjusted by ﬁtting the experimental distribution of trajectory durations with an exponentially decreasing function , giving k OFFFluo = 5 . 4 s − 1 ( mean trajectory duration = 220 ms ) . The parameter k ONFluo which determines the number of ﬂuorescent molecules per frame was set to 0 . 03 s − 1 , so as to yield approximately the same density of Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 11 April 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 835427 fnsyn - 14 - 835427 April 18 , 2022 Time : 13 : 36 # 12 Lagardère et al . Computing Neuroligin - 1 Dynamics and Organization visible molecules per surface area as in the experiments ( 0 . 25 molecule / µ m 2 ) . Sequences of 2 , 000 frames were generated as in the experiments , and only trajectories longer than 10 frames were selected . Trajectories containing the spatial positions and intensity of each molecule over time are saved as . trc ﬁles , and can be loaded later for oﬄine visualization and analysis ( menu SPT Analysis ) . The diﬀusion coeﬃcient , D , was calculated for each trajectory , from linear ﬁts of the ﬁrst four points of the MSD function versus time . Five independent simulations were run for each set of parameters , allowing the construction of histograms of diﬀusion coeﬃcients directly comparable to SPT experiments . Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching Simulations To match the dense distribution of NLGN1 molecules that characterize FRAP experiments , a relatively large number of molecules was introduced in the virtual cell ( 25 , 000 molecules in a dendritic segment of 135 µ m 2 , corresponding to a surface density of ∼ 148 molecules / µ m 2 ) . Simulations of 18 , 200 frames , including a baseline of 200 frames , were generated with a time step of 100 ms ( total duration 30 min ) and a sampling rate of 2 s . The photo - activation rate was set to a maximal value ( k ONFluo = 10 s − 1 ) , i . e . , all molecules are initially ﬂuorescent , while the photo - bleaching rate is set to zero during baseline and recovery acquisition ( i . e . , observational photo - bleaching is neglected ) . During the short photo - bleaching period ( 500 ms ) applied to four PSDs , the photo - bleaching rate was set to k oﬀ Bleach = 4 . 0 s − 1 for ﬁve frames , to precisely match the initial drop of ﬂuorescence observed experimentally ( ∼ 75 % ) . The number of molecules in the photo - bleached PSDs and in four control unbleached PSDs was computed over time , saved as a . txt ﬁle , and normalized between 1 ( baseline number of ﬂuorescent molecules before photo - bleaching ) and 0 ( number of ﬂuorescent molecules right after photo - bleaching ) . FRAP simulations were repeated 10 times , and the corresponding curves were averaged . To estimate the goodness of ﬁt between simulated and experimental FRAP curves , we calculated the coeﬃcient χ 2 = ( 1 / n ) (cid:54) i [ ( F iexp – F isim ) / σ i ] 2 , where n is the number of experimental values , i = 1 to n is the time point , F i are the normalized ﬂuorescence intensity values for both experiment ( exp ) and simulations ( sim ) , and σ i is the standard deviation of the experimental value . Direct STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy Simulations The switch - on rate k ONFluo at which ﬂuorescent dyes spontaneously emit light was determined by measuring the ﬂuorescence intensity collected from single Alexa647 - conjugated mSA molecules bound to the glass coverslip during a dSTORM sequence , and counting the number of peaks ( mean ± SEM = 1 . 7 ± 0 . 2 peaks over a time period of 400 s , n = 43 molecules analyzed , giving k ONFluo = 0 . 004 s − 1 ) . The switch - oﬀ rate k OFF Fluo was determined by ﬁtting the distribution of the time durations during which single Alexa647 - conjugated mSA emitted light before entering again the non - emitting state with an exponentially decreasing function ( average 11 . 1 ± 1 . 4 frames of 20 ms , 72 events analyzed ) , giving a value k OFFFluo = 6 . 3 s − 1 . The on - oﬀ duty cycle δ = k ONFluo / ( k ONFluo + k OFFFluo ) is the fraction of time that ﬂuorophores spend in the light - emitting state , and equals here 0 . 00067 , very close to reported values for isolated Alexa647 - conjugated anti - GFP nanobody ( Lagardère et al . , 2020 ) and for single Alexa647 dyes in MEA - based dSTORM buﬀer ( Dempsey et al . , 2011 ) , thereby conﬁrming that the ﬂuorophore to protein ratio of our conjugates is around 1 . The average number of experimentally detected mSA - Alexa647 molecules per plane in the neuronal contour was N = 13 . 3 , corresponding to a total number N / δ = 19 , 843 actual molecules in the cell geometry that was imaged ( 118 µ m 2 ) , thus representing a density of 167 molecules / µ m 2 . To mimic dSTORM experiments that rely on the saturating labeling of biotinylated AP - NLGN1 with mSA - Alexa647 , we thus introduced 19 , 843 molecules in the virtual dendritic segment . After the diﬀusion / trapping steady - state has been imposed , the simulation was paused and all diﬀusion coeﬃcients were set to zero to mimic cell ﬁxation . Then , simulations were run for 40 , 000 frames of 20 ms each ( total time of 800 s ) , and a single 16 - bit image was generated which contained the integration of all molecule localizations throughout time . Three parameters are used to render the super resolution image : the intensity associated with a single detection ; the zoom factor which is the ratio between the pixel sizes of the super - resolved image and the low resolution reference picture ( a ﬁvefold zoom corresponds to a pixel size of 32 nm in the high resolution image ) ; and the localization precision , which corresponds to the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution used to spread detections around the theoretical position of the molecule ( σ = 25 nm , FWHM = 58 nm ) . A single super - resolved image integrating all single molecule localizations is exported as a TIFF ﬁle . To estimate mSA copy numbers in PSDs at steady - state , a single TIFF image was generated from the SRI menu of FluoSim , after setting the coeﬃcients k ONFluo = 10 s − 1 and k OFFFluo = 0 s − 1 so as to visualize all emitting ﬂuorophores . The image was then opened in Metamorph and intensity values were read in PSDs deﬁned by previously saved ROIs .
