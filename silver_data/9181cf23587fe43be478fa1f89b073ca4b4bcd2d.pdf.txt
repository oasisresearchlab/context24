R OJAS AND J ACQUES D UMAIS If you can’t demonstrate it with balloons , it’s probably not important anyway . Stephen A . Wainwright , quoted in [ Vogel 2003 ] . Morphogenesis of plant , fungal , and bacterial cells depends heavily on surface mechanics and in particu - lar on the stiff wall that surrounds these cells . In this paper , we show that tubular rubber balloons offer a useful physical model of tip growth morphogenesis . In particular , the balloons reproduce accurately the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of surface expansion observed during tip growth . Comparison between the two systems has led to a simple model of tip growth that assumes linear constitutive relations with inhomogeneous material properties . The strain rate proﬁle predicted by the model is a surprisingly good ﬁt to the data given the model’s simplicity . We suggest that a meridional gradient of compliance or extensibility is the key mechanical feature that explains the similar strain rate proﬁles in tip - growing cells across broad taxonomic groups as well as in rubber balloon analogs . 1 . Introduction Cells come in a variety of shapes that are often ﬁnely adapted to fulﬁll speciﬁc functions . A familiar example is the human red blood cell whose ﬂexible biconcave geometry allows it to squeeze through narrow capillaries . The morphogenetic mechanisms that control the development of shape appear to be quite diverse [ Harold 1990 ] and few are particularly well understood . In bacteria , fungi , and plants , cell shape is to a large extent determined by the stiff extracellular matrix or cell wall surrounding the cell . The cell wall is a thin layer of polysaccharides and proteins assembled outside the plasma membrane . The architecture of cell walls can vary greatly although it typically takes the form of a ﬁber - reinforced composite where ﬁbrils of cellulose ( in plants ) provide stiffness to the wall while an amorphous matrix of pectins helps maintain the cohesion between the different wall components . This paper focuses on one important mode of cell morphogenesis called tip growth . The shape of tip - growing cells is characterized by a long cylinder capped by a prolate dome ( Figure 1 ) . Kinematics studies using cell surface markers have established that wall expansion is limited to the tip of the cell [ Reinhardt 1892 ; Hejnowicz et al . 1977 ; Shaw et al . 2000 ; Dumais et al . 2004 ] . Expansion at the tip is maintained by two complementary processes : the addition of cell surface material and the mechanical deformation of the cell surface into the characteristic cylindrical shape .

However , secretion of building material does not expand the cell surface unless the material is subsequently deformed and integrated into the preexisting extracellular matrix . This step requires mechanical work provided by the internal hydrostatic pressure of the cell . Although models of tip growth are available , few have attempted an explicit comparison with the kinematics of these cells . The goal of this paper is to introduce a simple mechanical model that reproduces the key features of tip growth morphogenesis . 2 . The kinematics of tip growth Over a period of minutes or hours , the elongation of tip - growing cells is surprisingly steady both in terms of geometry and the rate of elongation , as shown in Figure 1 [ Shaw et al . 2000 ] . Kinematics studies of tip growth have been performed using time - lapse imaging of marked cells [ Castle 1958 ; Chen 1973 ; Hejnowicz et al . 1977 ; Shaw et al . 2000 ; Dumais et al . 2004 ] ; see Figures 2 and 3 .

The cell geometry is given by the meridional curvature ( κ s ) ( Figure 3B ) while the rates of surface expansion can be derived from the meridional velocity ( v ) of material points with respect to the pole of the cell ( Figure 3C ) . Given these variables , the strain rates are deﬁned as [ Hejnowicz et al . 1977 ; Dumais et al . 2004 ] : ˙ (cid:15) s = d ds ds dt = d v ds , ˙ (cid:15) θ = 1 r dr dt = 1 r dr ds v , ( 1 ) where the variables are illustrated in Figure 2 . Studies of cellular tip growth have revealed two fundamental features of wall expansion : surface expansion is inhomogeneous and anisotropic ( Figure 4 ) . The inhomogeneity is seen in the sharp decline of the strain rates from a maximal value near the pole of the cell to zero on the side of the cell . Surface expansion also shows a characteristic anisotropy with meridional anisotropy ( ˙ (cid:15) s > ˙ (cid:15) θ ) within two to three microns of the pole and extensive circumferential anisotropy ( ˙ (cid:15) θ > ˙ (cid:15) s ) on the ﬂanks of the tip ( Figure 4 ) . The strain proﬁle observed in root hairs is similar to those reported for other tip - growing cells including the Chara rhizoid [ Hejnowicz et al . 1977 ] , the Nitella rhizoid [ Chen 1973 ] , and the sporangiophore of Phycomyces [ Castle 1958 ] . Since these systems include representatives of fungi , plants and algae , that differ greatly in wall chemistry and cell biology , one is tempted to attribute the similarities in the 1160 ROBERTO BERNAL , ENRIQUE R .

A slight meridional anisotropy ( ˙ (cid:15) s > ˙ (cid:15) θ ) near the pole is followed by long shoulders of circumferential anisotropy ( ˙ (cid:15) θ > ˙ (cid:15) s ) . For comparison , the isotropic strain solution for the same geometry is shown ( dotted line ) . Modiﬁed from [ Dumais et al . 2004 ] . kinematics of these cells to some broadly shared processes . Therefore , the ﬁrst question to ask is whether the observed strain rate proﬁle is a geometrical requirement for all tip - growing cells . Although geometry certainly constrains kinematics , the statement above cannot be generally true since there is an inﬁnite number of strain rate proﬁles that are compatible with the geometry of the system . A comparison with the proﬁle corresponding to an isotropic deformation of the surface reveals what is unique about the observed strain rate pattern . Setting the two equations in ( 1 ) equal to one another leads to the differential equation 1 v d v ds = 1 r dr ds , which has as a general solution v ( s ) = v c r c r ( s ) , where v c is the tip velocity and r c is the radius of the cylindrical region of the cell . The isotropic strain rates associated with this velocity proﬁle are : ˙ (cid:15) i = ˙ (cid:15) s = ˙ (cid:15) θ = v c r c drds . The solution is shown in Figure 4 alongside the measured strain rates . Strain isotropy , in itself , is not a good model for the observed strain rates . However , three kinematic constraints can help explain some of the features of the observed strain rates : ( i ) rotational symmetry requires that ˙ (cid:15) s ( 0 ) = ˙ (cid:15) θ ( 0 ) ; ( ii ) the area under the ˙ (cid:15) s curve and the isotropic strain rate solution must be equal since it is set by the velocity of the tip , i . e . R ∞ 0 ˙ (cid:15) s ds = R ∞ 0 ˙ (cid:15) i ds = v c ; ( iii ) the circumferential strain rate is asymptotic to the isotropic solution near the base of the dome , i . e . , ˙ (cid:15) θ = v r dr ds ’ v c r c dr ds = ˙ (cid:15) i , for r → r c . Given these constraints , the main differences between the observed strain rates and the isotropic solu - tion can be encapsulated into one observation : tip - growing cells show relatively more surface expansion near the pole than what is predicted by the isotropic solution . Since ˙ (cid:15) s exceeds ˙ (cid:15) i near the pole , it must drop below ˙ (cid:15) i away from the pole so that the second constraint is fulﬁlled . This feature explains the sharp TIP GROWTH MORPHOGENESIS AND RUBBER BALLOONS 1161 decline in ˙ (cid:15) s observed in Figure 4 . The circumferential anisotropy is also predicted since while ˙ (cid:15) s < ˙ (cid:15) i on the ﬂanks of the tip , the third constraint requires that ˙ (cid:15) θ → ˙ (cid:15) i at that location . Therefore , high strain rate ( relative to the isotropic solution ) near the pole of the cell implies circumferential anisotropy on the ﬂanks of the dome . A similar argument was made by Green and King [ 1966 ] , who demonstrated the validity of their result using locally reinforced rubber membranes . These statements will be made more precise when we discuss our model in Section 4 , but ﬁrst we look at the kinematics of rubber balloons from which the model was inspired . 3 . Analysis of rubber balloon expansion D’Arcy W . Thompson [ 1942 ] is widely credited for popularizing the idea that many seemingly complex biological phenomena , including cell morphogenesis , are governed by simple geometrical and physical principles . It is in this spirit that Hejnowicz et al . [ 1977 ] drew a parallel between tip growth morphogen - esis and the growth of cylindrical rubber balloons . These balloons undergo an instability [ Chater and Hutchinson 1984 ] whereby two cylindrical solutions can coexist at the given internal pressure , as shown in Figure 5 . Inﬂation of the balloon pushes forward the zone of transition between these two cylindrical solutions . According to Hejnowicz and coworkers , the migration of the front is analogous to tip growth . The small - radius tail that precedes the front is regarded as a source of new material on which the large - radius solution feeds during growth . The narrow tail could well be pushed inside the inﬂating balloon to become an “internal” source of material as in tip growth . An analysis of the deformation process in rubber balloons shows that the parallels go beyond the simple geometrical analogy . 3 . 1 . Experimental setup . We used an experimental conﬁguration similar to that of Kyriakides and Chang [ 1991 ] to follow the steady - state growth of cylindrical rubber balloons ( Qualatex 160Q ) under constant A B Figure 5 . ( A ) Snapshot of the inﬂated balloon with its ﬁducial points . ( B ) Propagation of the growth front during inﬂation . The velocity of the material entering the front is V = 2 . 55 mm / s assuming that the front is ﬁxed in space . The velocity of the material that exits the front is v c = λ max s V = 3 . 74 × 2 . 55 mm / s = 9 . 54 mm / sec , where λ max s is the maximal meridional stretch . 1162 ROBERTO BERNAL , ENRIQUE R . ROJAS AND JACQUES DUMAIS Figure 6 . Diagram of the experimental setup for the rubber balloon deformation under constant internal pressure . internal pressure P of 24 . 3 kPa , measured with an OMEGA PX26 - 005GV pressure transducer ( Figure 6 ) . To get a uniform and straight advance of the growth front , the balloon was maintained under slight axial tension by pulling with a mass M ’ 20 g . The axial stress in the elastic membrane associated with this tension was approximately 50 kPa , which is negligible compared to the membrane stresses imposed by the internal pressure ( 210 kPa < Pr / h < 21 MPa ) . Time - lapse sequences were recorded at 10 frames per second with a PIXELINK PL - A781 camera . The meridional curvature was measured using the outline of the balloon and the stretches were computed by tracking the position of ﬁducial points applied to one side of the balloon ( Figure 5 ) . All further analyses were done in Matlab 7 . 3 and assumed an axisymmetric geometry . These data provide the information to characterize the kinematics of the balloon . 3 . 2 . Kinematics . As the rubber balloon deforms under the internal pressure , the growth front pushes forward , delimiting two cylindrical regions in which the radii of the balloon are r min = 2 . 32 mm and r max = 11 . 2 mm , respectively . The undeformed radius ( i . e . at P = 0 ) is R = 2 . 12 mm . The separation of the ﬁducial points was on average dS ’ 1 mm before stretching and reached a maximum of 3 . 7 mm in the deformed region . The undeformed thickness of the membrane was H = 0 . 27 mm . The kinematics of the balloon is formulated in terms of stretches . The meridional , circumferential and normal stretches are ratios of length elements before and after the deformation : λ s = ds / dS , λ θ = r / R , λ n = h / H , where capital letters stand for undeformed lengths . These stretches are generally not completely inde - pendent . For an incompressible material , we have λ s λ θ λ n = 1 or , alternatively , λ n = ( λ θ λ s ) − 1 . The meridional curvature is κ s = d ϕ / ds , where ϕ is the angle between the normal to the surface and the axis of the balloon ( Figure 2 ) . The meridional curvature deﬁnes two regions ( Figure 7A ) . A core region within 7 mm of the axis shows negative curvature . It corresponds to the source of material for the advance of the front . An outer region extends from a distance of 7 mm onwards . In our analogy with tip growth morphogenesis , this region stands for the deforming cell surface and is thus of special interest . Using the balloon outline and the position of ﬁducial points , we computed the stretches of the elastic membrane ( Figure 7B ) . The maximal circumferential stretch is λ θ = 5 . 63 while the maximal meridional stretch is λ s = 3 . 74 . For comparison with tip - growing cells , we need to deﬁne strain rates for the elastic deformation of the membrane . The velocity of material points , assuming that the front is ﬁxed in space while material ﬂows through it , is given by v ( s ) = λ s ( s ) V , where V is the velocity at which underformed TIP GROWTH MORPHOGENESIS AND RUBBER BALLOONS 1163 - 0 . 25 - 0 . 2 - 0 . 15 - 0 . 1 - 0 . 05 0 0 . 05 0 . 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 - 30 - 20 - 10 0 10 20 30 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 Arc length position ( mm ) ˙ ! s ˙ ! θ λ s λ θ κ s M e r i od i ona l c u r v a t u r e ( mm - 1 ) S t r e t c he s S t r a i n r a t e s ( s e c - 1 ) A B C Figure 7 .

Three fundamental relations for thin pressurized shells . material feeds into the front . Accordingly , the strain rates are ˙ (cid:15) s = d ds v = d λ s ds V , ˙ (cid:15) θ = 1 r dr dt = R r d ( r / R ) ds ds dS dS dt = λ s λ θ d λ θ ds V . ( 2 ) The measured strain rates show substantial variation ( Figure 7C ) . In the polar region , the two strain rates increase rapidly to a near maximal value as the material is about the exit this region . In the outer region , the strain rates decline gradually . The strain rate anisotropy ﬁrst favors meridional stretching followed by long shoulders where circumferential stretching dominates . The similarities with the strain rates reported for plant cells is striking . In particular , the strain rate anisotropy and inhomogeneity follow the same trends and are mapped to the same regions in the two systems . 4 . A model of tip growth The similarities between cellular tip growth and the balloon analog prompted us to look for a simple model that could be applied to both systems . Given the sharp differences between the material properties of rubber ( nonlinear elasticity ) and plant cell walls ( viscoplasticity ) , we postulate that the strain rate proﬁle does not depend strongly on the details of the constitutive behavior . Our focus therefore is on features that are known to be shared between rubber balloons and tip - growing cells . The two systems are thin pressurized shells whose material properties are spatially varying . The mechanics of thin shells is well understood particularly those with axisymmetric geometry [ Fl ¨ ugge 1973 ] . A set of three fundamental relations connect the stresses σ , the strains (cid:15) , and geometrical variables such as the curvature κ of the surface and the shell thickness h ; see Figure 8 . The kinematic relations are already encapsulated in Equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . Equations are also needed for the balance of forces between the membrane stresses and the internal pressure . The wall stresses are given by σ s = P 2 h κ θ , σ θ = P 2 h κ θ (cid:18) 2 − κ s κ θ (cid:19) , ( 3 ) [ Steele 2000 ; Dumais et al . 2006 ] , where P is the internal hydrostatic pressure , h is the wall thickness , and κ s and κ θ are the meridional and circumferential curvatures . Note that the normal stress , σ n ∼ P , TIP GROWTH MORPHOGENESIS AND RUBBER BALLOONS 1165 is much smaller than the plane stresses , σ s and σ θ . We can therefore neglect the normal stress in the following treatment . Next we must select a constitutive model to relate the strains and stresses . Several constitutive models have been suggested for the plant cell wall ( see [ Dumais et al . 2006 ] , for instance ) and rubber elasticity ( see [ Ogden 1972 ; Treloar et al . 1976 ] , for example ) . These models are very different except in the limit of small deformation where a linear set of equations can be applied to most materials . We therefore adopt a simple linear constitutive model : (cid:18) (cid:15) s ( s ) (cid:15) θ ( s ) (cid:19) = α ( s ) (cid:18) 1 − ν − ν 1 (cid:19) (cid:18) σ s ( s ) σ θ ( s ) (cid:19) , ( 4 ) where α ( s ) is a spatially varying elastic compliance and ν is a ﬁxed Poisson’s ratio . In this model , the complexity of the material’s response to stress is encapsulated in the compliance α rather than in a more complex functional form for the model . One important advantage of this model is that it can be solved analytically for a given tip geometry . Substituting for the strains and stresses in Equation ( 4 ) yields (cid:15) s = ds dS − 1 = α (cid:18) P 2 h κ θ − ν P 2 h κ θ (cid:16) 2 − κ s κ θ (cid:17)(cid:19) , (cid:15) θ = r R − 1 = α (cid:18) P 2 h κ θ (cid:16) 2 − κ s κ θ (cid:17) − ν P 2 h κ θ (cid:19) . ( 5 ) Dividing the ﬁrst equation by the second and rearranging , we get ds = (cid:18)(cid:16) r R − 1 (cid:17) ( 1 − 2 ν ) κ θ + νκ s ( 2 − ν ) κ θ − κ s + 1 (cid:19) dS . ( 6 ) Finally , dividing both sides of this equation by dt , we get v ( s ) = (cid:18)(cid:16) r R − 1 (cid:17) ( 1 − 2 ν ) κ θ + νκ s ( 2 − ν ) κ θ − κ s + 1 (cid:19) V = λ s V = λ s λ max s v c . ( 7 ) From ( 7 ) it is possible to determine the velocity proﬁle based solely on the shell geometry ( r ( s ) or κ s ( s ) ) and two parameters , the Poisson’s ratio ( ν ) and a characteristic velocity ( V or v c ) . v c is the velocity of the front with respect to the deformed region . We adopt this parameter since it has a natural parallel with the velocity for tip growth . The Poisson’s ratio of rubber is close to 0 . 5 for small deformations but for strains above one it quickly drops to 0 . 3 [ Vincent 1990 ] . Since the balloon strains go beyond a value of 4 , we use ν = 0 . 3 . Using the values for ν and v c in ( 7 ) and substituting into ( 2 ) allows us to predict the strain rates for the balloon ( Figure 9A ) . A comparison with the measured strain rates ( Figure 7C ) reveals that the model is surprisingly accurate despite its simplicity . In particular , the model captures the switch in strain rate anisotropy as well as the magnitude of the maximal strain rates . The constitutive model can be modiﬁed easily to account for tip growth . Since the wall material deforms irreversibly , we must now relate stresses with strain rates rather than strains . Equations ( 5 ) then 1166 ROBERTO BERNAL , ENRIQUE R .

( 9 ) Here α can be interpreted as an extensibility ( inverse viscosity ) . Dividing the ﬁrst equation by the second and rearranging gives 1 v d v ds = 1 r dr ds ( 1 − 2 ν ) κ θ + νκ s ( 2 − ν ) κ θ − κ s ( 10 ) This differential equation for v , with boundary condition v ( 0 ) = 0 , has for solution v ( s ) = γ r ( s ) exp (cid:0)R s 0 G ( s ) ds (cid:1) , G ( s ) = 1 r dr ds ( 1 + ν ) ( κ s − κ θ ) ( 2 − ν ) κ θ − κ s , ( 11 ) where γ is a constant set by the geometry and elongation rate of the tip . We used this equation and ν = 0 . 3 to predict the strain rates for tip growth ( Figure 9B ) . Again , the predicted strain rates are very similar to the observed strain rates ( Figure 4 ) . It is surprising that a model that does not include material anisotropy can nonetheless account for strain rate anisotropy so accurately . We must conclude that the observed anisotropy in the strain rates results from a similar anisotropy in the membrane stresses . Finally , we computed the material property α ( s ) predicted by the model ( Figure 10 ) . This parameter represents a compliance for the rubber material or an extensibility for the cell wall . Given the simplicity of the model , it is unlikely that α represents a true material property . We interpret it more generally as the responsiveness of the system to the internal pressure . The parameter α maps out the polar zone that serves as a source of material ( d α / ds > 0 ) and the ﬂanks of the tip , where the material is actively stretched and therefore stiffening ( d α / ds < 0 ) . The similarity between the balloon analog and tip - growing cells is again quite remarkable .

Conclusions The similar pattern of surface expansion in tip - growing cells and rubber balloons calls for an explanation . The ﬁrst explanation to consider is whether there is only a limited set of strain patterns that can maintain tip growth ; that is , shared kinematics constraints could explain the similarities . As indicated above , and illustrated in Figure 4 , very different strain patterns are compatible with a given tip geometry and elongation velocity . Therefore , kinematics alone is not a sufﬁcient explanation for the similar expansion pattern . Tip - growing cells and rubber balloons must share features at a more fundamental level . We propose that the presence of a source of soft material in the polar region is one likely common feature . In the balloon , the rapid stiffening of the material as it is stretched can explain the characteristic geometry of the growing front . Strain stiffening has also been proposed for tip growth morphogenesis [ Green and King 1966 ] . The stiff cellulose microﬁbrils that make up a large volume fraction of plant cell walls are synthesized in the polar region presumably in a relaxed state . As the tip surface deforms , the ﬁbrils would be progressively put under tension thus increasing rapidly the stiffness of the wall . Clearly , plant cell expansion is not an elastic phenomenon but the presence of long cellulose microﬁbrils in the wall means that the cell possesses some memory of past deformation . The main conclusion of this work is that many aspects of cell morphogenesis , despite their complex biological underpinning , may still be explained via relatively simple physical principles . For the case of tip growth morphogenesis , we have shown that a simple constitutive model with isotropic material properties is sufﬁcient to explain the observed strain rate anisotropy . We postulate that strain stiffening of the wall’s molecular fabric accounts for the meridional variation of the wall extensibility . References [ Castle 1958 ] E . S .
