Here , we directly visualize chromatin looping at the Fbn2 TAD in mouse embryonic stem cells using super - resolution live - cell imaging and quantify looping dynamics by Bayesian inference . Our results are consistent with cohesin - mediated loop extrusion in cells , and with CTCF both stopping and stabilizing cohesin . Surprisingly , the Fbn2 loop is both rare and dynamic , with a looped fraction of ~ 3 - 6 . 5 % and a median loop lifetime of ~ 10 - 30 minutes . Instead of a stable loop , our results establish a highly dynamic view of TADs and loops where the Fbn2 TAD exists predominantly in a partially extruded conformation . This dynamic and quantitative view of TADs may facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their functions . INTRODUCTION Mammalian genomes are folded into loops and domains known as Topologically Associating Domains ( TADs ) by the proteins CTCF and cohesin ( 1 ) . Mechanistically , cohesin is thought to load on DNA and bidirectionally extrude loops until it is blocked by CTCF such that CTCF establishes TAD boundaries ( 2 – 7 ) . Functionally , CTCF - and cohesin - mediated looping and TADs play critical roles in multiple nuclear processes including regulation of gene expression , somatic recombination , and DNA repair ( 8 ) . For example , TADs are thought to regulate gene expression by increasing the frequency of enhancer - promoter interactions within a TAD , and decreasing enhancer - promoter interactions between TADs ( 9 ) . However , to understand how TADs and loops are formed and maintained , and how they function , it is necessary to understand whether TADs are stable or dynamic structures and to quantify the dynamics and lifetime of CTCF / cohesin - mediated loops . Though recent advances in single - cell genomics and fixed - cell imaging have made it possible to generate static snapshots of 3D genome structures in single cells ( 10 – 15 ) , live - cell imaging is required to understand the dynamics of chromatin looping ( 16 ) . Furthermore , previous studies have yielded conflicting results as to whether loops are well - defined in single cells ( 10 – 15 ) , perhaps due to the difficulty associated with distinguishing bona fide CTCF - and cohesin - mediated loops from mere proximity that emerges stochastically ( 16 ) . Recent pioneering work has visualized enhancer - promoter interactions ( 17 , 18 ) and long - range V ( D ) J - chromatin interactions ( 19 ) in live cells . However , the dynamics of loop extrusion and the lifetime of CTCF / cohesin loops have not yet been quantified in living cells , which we therefore set out to do . RESULTS To visualize the dynamics of CTCF / cohesin looping , we chose as our model system the loop holding together the two CTCF - bound boundaries of the 505 kb Fbn2 TAD in mouse Embryonic Stem Cells ( mESCs ) . This TAD is verified to be CTCF dependent ( 20 ) and relatively simple as it contains a single gene , Fbn2 , which is not expressed in mESCs ( Fig . 1A ) . We used genome - editing to homozygously label the left and right CTCF sites of the Fbn2 TAD with TetO and Anchor3 arrays , which we then visualized by co - expressing the fluorescently tagged 1 ARTICLE PREPRINT binding proteins TetR - 3x - mScarlet and EGFP - OR3 ( 21 ) ( clone C36 ) ( Fig . 1B - D ) . We developed a comprehensive image analysis framework , ConnectTheDots , to extract trajectories of 3D loop anchor positions from the acquired movies ( Fig . S1 ) . By optimizing 3D super - resolution live - cell imaging conditions ( 16 ) , we could track Fbn2 looping dynamics at 20 second resolution for over 2 hours ( Fig . 1D ) . After DNA replication in S / G2 phase , it is no longer possible to reliably distinguish intrachromosomal from sister - chromosomal interactions ( 16 ) . We therefore developed and validated a convolutional neural network to filter out replicated and low - quality dots ( Fig . S2 ) . Thus , we only consider G1 and early S - phase cells . To validate our system for tracking Fbn2 loop dynamics , we carried out a series of control experiments . First , we confirmed using Micro - C ( 22 , 23 ) that our locus labeling approach did not measurably perturb the Fbn2 loop ( Fig . 1A ) . Second , as a positive looping control we deleted the 505 kb between the CTCF sites , generating clone C27 ( Fig . 1C ) . As expected , this significantly reduced the 3D distance ( Fig . 1E ) . Third , as a negative control for CTCF - mediated looping , we generated clone C65 ( Fig . 1C ) by homozygously deleting the 3 CTCF motifs in the Fbn2 TAD ( L1 , L2 , R1 ; Fig . 1A ) and validated that this resulted in loss of CTCF binding and cohesin co - localization by ChIP - Seq ( Fig . S3 ) . As expected , the 3D distance was significantly increased in C65 ( Fig . 1E ) . Interestingly , from Mean - Squared Displacement ( MSD ) analysis , chromatin showed Rouse polymer dynamics with a scaling of MSD ~ t 0 . 5 for all three clones ( 24 ) ( Fig . 1F ) . We conclude that our approach faithfully reports on CTCF looping dynamics in live cells without noticeable artifacts . To elucidate the specific contribution of CTCF and cohesin , we generated cell lines to acutely deplete the cohesin subunit RAD21 , CTCF , and the cohesin unloader WAPL . We used genome - editing to endogenously tag these Fig . 1 . Endogenous labeling and tracking of the Fbn2 loop with super - resolution live cell imaging .

S4 ) and validated these cell lines . First , we achieved near - complete depletion of RAD21 and CTCF within 2 hours , while WAPL depletion took 4 hours and was less complete ( Fig . S4 ) . Second , long - term depletion of RAD21 and CTCF led to cell death as expected for loss of essential proteins ( Fig . S5 ) , whereas WAPL depletion caused only a minor growth defect and occasionally yielded visible compacted ( ‘vermicelli’ ) chromosomes after sustained depletion ( 26 ) . Third , we quantified the protein abundances in the AID cell lines without IAA and note that they are lower likely due to leaky protein depletion ( Fig . S6 ) . Fourth , we used Micro - C to verify that RAD21 and CTCF depletion led to loss of the Fbn2 loop or corner peak as expected ( 27 – 30 ) ( Fig . 2A ) and used ChIP - Seq to verify disrupted CTCF and cohesin chromatin binding ( Fig . S7 ) . In contrast , WAPL depletion increased corner peak strength ( 29 – 31 ) ( Fig . 2A ) . Thus , our validated AID lines enable efficient and acute protein depletion . We next studied the specific roles of RAD21 , CTCF , and WAPL in loop extrusion in vivo by imaging our validated AID lines ( Fig . 2B - C ) . Consistent with RAD21 being required for loop extrusion , RAD21 depletion strongly increased the 3D distances ( Fig . 2B - C ) . Consistent with CTCF being the boundary factor required for Fbn2 loop formation ( Fig . 1B ) , but not for loop extrusion , CTCF depletion increased 3D distances albeit significantly less than RAD21 depletion ( 7 ) ( Fig . 2B - C ) . Finally , consistent with prior observations that WAPL depletion increases cohesin’s residence time and abundance on chromatin ( 26 ) , potentially allowing it to extrude longer and more stable loops ( 29 , 31 ) , WAPL depletion decreased the 3D distances ( Fig . 2B - C ; ΔWAPL is attenuated due to lower CTCF and Fig . 2 .

The effective tether length is obtained by computing the ratio of the steady - state variance of each clone to the value in the RAD21 - depletion condition ( note that 2 < R ² > is also the asymptotic value of the MSD ; see also Supplementary Material ) .

The extrusion rate is for two - sided extrusion . 3 ARTICLE PREPRINT cohesin abundances in this clone and less efficient depletion ; Fig . S4 , S6 ) . To quantify the effect of loop extrusion in our AID lines we turned to polymer physics theory . The Rouse model predicts a linear relationship between chain length and mean squared distance ( < R ² > ) between the fluorescent labels ( dashed lines in Fig . 2D , Fig . S8 ) . This relationship allows us to assign an “effective tether length” to each experimental condition by taking ΔRAD21 as a reference value , and assuming that ΔRAD21 represents the fully unextruded state with a genomic separation of 515 kb . We find an effective tether of ~ 200 kb in wildtype ( C36 ) and ~ 280 kb in ΔCTCF , corresponding to ~ 39 % and ~ 54 % of the full genomic separation respectively . Thus , conversely , the genomic separation between the two labels shortens by ~ 46 % due to extrusion alone ( ΔRAD21 vs . ΔCTCF ) and ~ 61 % due to extrusion with boundarie s ( ΔRAD21 vs . C36 ) . We refer to the latter percentages as the fraction ( of the Fbn2 region ) extruded but caution that extrusion of the loop anchors themselves complicates this picture , specifically contributing to the longer effective tether in ΔCTCF . The increased tether length after CTCF depletion is thus consistent with CTCF serving as an extrusion boundary . In summary , we find that on average just over half of the Fbn2 TAD is extruded into loops . Having demonstrated that CTCF and cohesin regulate Fbn2 compaction ( Fig . 2A - D ) , we next sought to develop an inference method to quantify loop dynamics . To generate ground truth data to benchmark such a method , we used the Micro - C contact maps ( Fig . 2A ) , the absolute 3D distances ( Fig . 2C ) , and the MSDs ( Fig . 2D ) in the C36 , ΔCTCF , and ΔRAD21 conditions to constrain and parameterize 3D polymer simulations incorporating loop extrusion . Consistent with our ΔRAD21 data , our polymer simulations resulted in chromosome decompaction after near - complete RAD21 depletion ( Fig . 2E ) and accurately matched our experimental data ( Fig . 2F ) . We then used these simulations to benchmark a method to infer looped states . To infer looped state dynamics , we developed Fig . 3 . Bayesian Inference of Looping Dynamics ( BILD ) reveals rare and dynamic CTCF loops . ( A ) Example trajectory from polymer simulations with loop extrusion . Extrusion shortens the effective tether ( unextruded length ; red ) between the CTCF sites ; The tether is minimal when cohesin is stalled at CTCF on both sides , which we take as ground truth looping events ( black bar ) . The inference captures these accurately , but raises false positive detections occasionally ( pink bars ) . We limit false positive detections by introducing an evidence bias ΔE ( purple bar ) . ( B ) Schematic overview over BILD . Building on the analytical solution to the Rouse model , we employ an evidence - based optimization scheme to determine the optimal looping profile in two steps .

We coarse - grain the possible conformations of the two CTCF sites into two states : 1 ) a state of sustained contact ( the ‘looped state’ ) , where presumably a CTCF - cohesin complex holds together the Fbn2 loop and 2 ) all other possible conformations including partially extruded conformations , random contacts , and the fully unlooped conformation ( the ‘unlooped state’ ; Fig . 3A - B , Fig . S9 ) . We model the unlooped state ( label led θ = 0 ) as a free Rouse polymer and calibrate it to our ΔCTCF data . For the looped state we introduce a switchable bond between the two CTCF sites ( θ = 1 ; Fig . 3B ) , whose strength we set to reproduce the 10 kb distance between the fluorophores , using ΔRAD21 as reference for a free 515 kb chain . Thus , our biological controls allow us to define the looped state as the state that disappears in the ΔCTCF condition . We infer the number of switches k between the two states by maximizing the model evidence E . We then infer when the switches occur by maximum a posterior estimation ( Fig . 3C ) . To reduce false positives , we introduced an evidence margin ΔE , which reduces the sensitivity of loop detection but renders the detected looping segments more reliable ( Fig . 3A , Fig . S10 ) . Our final inference scheme , BILD , accurately inferred both the looped fraction and loop lifetime when applied to our 3D polymer simulation data with experimentally realistic localization uncertainty ( Fig . S10 - 11 ) . We next used BILD to infer looping in our experimental trajectory data ( Fig . 3D - G ) . BILD revealed that the Fbn2 TAD is fully looped ~ 6 . 5 % ( ~ 3 % ) of the time , but spends ~ 93 . 5 % ( 97 % ) of the time in a fully unlooped or partially extruded conformation ( Fig . 3F ) . We use brackets to indicate the looped fraction after false positive correction ( Fig . S11 ) . In contrast , we observed a minimal looped fraction of ~ 2 % ( ~ 0 % ) in Δ RAD21 and ΔCTCF , and ~ 4 % ( ~ 1 % ) in C65 , whereas the looped fraction was significantly increased to ~ 10 % ( ~ 6 % ) in ΔWAPL , consistent with WAPL unloading cohesin from chromatin ( 26 ) . Finally , we estimated the lifetime of the looped state ( Fig . 3E , G ) . Lifetime estimation is challenging due to ‘censoring’ , which occurs if the trajectory either begins or ends in the looped state . To correct for censoring , we used the Kaplan - Meier estimator of the survival probability ( Fig . 3G ) . We also provide an orthogonal estimate of the median lifetime from an exponential fit , which generally agrees with the Kaplan - Meier estimate . Together , these give an estimate of the median loop lifetime of ~ 10 - 30 min in the wildtype C36 line ( Fig . 3G , Fig . S11D ) . Though our estimates are associated with uncertainty and though we cannot exclude the existence of a very rare but long - lived loop state , these results nevertheless reveal the fully looped CTCF - cohesin complex state to be both rare ( ~ 3 % ) and quite dynamic ( median ~ 10 - 30 min ; mean ~ 15 - 45 min ) . Thus , during an average ~ 12 hour mESC cell cycle , the looped state will occur ~ 1 - 2 times lasting cumulatively ~ 20 - 45 min , but the remaining ~ 11 . 5 hours will be in the partially extruded or unlooped state . Wondering how to reconcile a low looped fraction of ~ 3 % with a clear and strong corner peak in the Micro - C map , we set up polymer simulations with loop extrusion . We found that CTCF - mediated stabilization of cohesin was Fig . 4 . Comprehensive picture of the Fbn2 TAD .

( D ) “Anatomy” of the Fbn2 TAD . Quantitative description of the Fbn2 TAD using both real data ( blue ) and our best - fit simulation ( green ) . Cohesin processivity and density and CTCF stalling probability and lifetime boost are simulation parameters . Fraction of time in different conformations was extracted from simulation ground truth , using effective tether lengths of 1 . 1 kb and 505 kb as cutoffs to define “fully looped” and “fully unlooped” respectively . Fraction of TAD unextruded was obtained as mean tether length over the full simulation . Experimental values are from Figs . 2 , 3 . 5 ARTICLE PREPRINT necessary to reproduce both these features in our simulations ( Fig . 4 , S12 ; Supplementary Material ) , consistent with recent reports ( 32 , 33 ) ( Fig . 4 , S12 ; Supplementary Material ) . We confirmed this effect using iFRAP of cohesin , finding that CTCF depletion decreases cohesin’s residence time ( Fig . S13 ) . Incorporating this effect , we then simulated loop extrusion with a cohesin density of 1 / 240 kb and processivity of 150 kb ( processivity = lifetime * extrusion speed ) . When cohesin reaches a CTCF site , it has a probability of 12 . 5 % to stall , which , using the estimate of 50 % CTCF occupancy ( 34 ) , translates to a ~ 25 % capture efficiency of CTCF . Once stalled by CTCF , cohesin is stabilized 4 - fold beyond its base lifetime of ~ 20 min ( 35 ) ( Fig . S13 ) , facilitating the formation of longer loops . These simulations reproduced both our experimental Micro - C maps ( Fig . 4A ) and the median loop lifetime and low looped fraction ( Fig . 4B ) . Together , these results allow us to paint a comprehensive mechanistic picture of the Fbn2 TAD ( Fig . 4C - D ) : most of the time ( ~ 92 % ) , the TAD is partially extruded , with ~ 57 - 61 % of the Fbn2 region captured in ~ 1 - 3 extruding cohesin loops , while ~ 39 - 43 % remain unextruded . The fully unlooped conformation , as it would be found in the absence of cohesin , occurs only ~ 6 % of the time , while the fully looped state is even more rare at ~ 3 % ( ~ 2 % in simulations ) and has a median lifetime of ~ 10 - 30 min . Interestingly , our simulations reveal that the looped state is sometimes held together by multiple cohesins ( Fig . 4C ) , which also explains why the loop lifetime can be substantially shorter than the CTCF - stabilized cohesin lifetime ( Fig . S13 ) . Nevertheless , we stress that both the mechanistic assumptions of our polymer simulations and the experimental data constraining them are associated with uncertainty , resulting in uncertainty of the inferred parameters ( Fig . 4D ) . We also note that TADs smaller than the 505 kb Fbn2 TAD as well as TADs with stronger CTCF boundaries may have a higher looped fraction ( Giorgetti and co - workers , personal communication ) . Furthermore , we propose that our absolute quantification of the Fbn2 looped fraction may now allow calibrated inference of absolute looped fractions genome - wide , based on Micro - C ( 15 ) . DISCUSSION Our findings reveal the CTCF / cohesin - mediated looped state that holds together CTCF boundaries of TADs to be rare , dynamic , and transient . A key limitation of our study is that it represents just one loop in one cell type . Nevertheless , the Fbn2 loop is among the strongest quartile of “corner peaks” in Micro - C maps , suggesting that most other similarly sized loops in mESCs are likely weaker than Fbn2 ( Fig . S14 ) . Our results thus rule out static models of TADs , where TADs exist in either a fully unlooped state or a fully looped state stably bridged by one cohesin ( Fig . 1B ) . Instead , we show that the Fbn2 TAD most often exists in a partially extruded state formed by a few cohesins in live cells ( ~ 92 % ; Fig . 4D ) , and that when the rare looped state is formed , it is both transient ( ~ 10 - 30 min median lifetime ; Fig . 4B ) and sometimes bridged by multiple cohesins ( Fig . 4C ) . Overall , frequent cohesin - mediated contacts within a TAD rather than rare CTCF - CTCF loops may therefore be more important for regulatory interactions , such as those between enhancers and promoters . Thus , instead of stable loops , we observe a much more dynamic and transitory picture of TADs in live cells ( Fig . 4D ) , which may also help explain cell - to - cell variation in 3D genome structure , and consequently stochasticity in downstream processes such as gene expression and cell differentiation .
