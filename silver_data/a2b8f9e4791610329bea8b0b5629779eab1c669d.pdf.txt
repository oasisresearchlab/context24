Lubensky , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , and approved February 13 , 2009 ( received for review November 6 , 2008 ) Sorting of lipids and proteins is a key process allowing eukaryotic cells to execute efﬁcient and accurate intracellular transport and to maintain membrane homeostasis . It occurs during the formation of highly curved transport intermediates that shuttle between cell compartments . Protein sorting is reasonably well described , but lipid sorting is much less understood . Lipid sorting has been proposed to be mediated by a physical mechanism based on the coupling between membrane composition and high curvature of the transport intermediates . To test this hypothesis , we have performed a combination of ﬂuorescence and force measurements on membrane tubes of controlled diameters pulled from giant unilamellar vesicles . A model based on membrane elasticity and nonideal solution theory has also been developed to explain our results . We quantitatively show , using 2 independent approaches , that a difference in lipid composition can build up between a curved and a noncurved membrane . Importantly , and consistent with our theory , lipid sorting occurs only if the system is close to a demixing point . Remarkably , this process is ampliﬁed when even a low fraction of lipids is clustered upon cholera toxin binding . This can be explained by the reduction of the entropic penalty of lipid sorting when some lipids are bound together by the toxin . Our results show that curvature - induced lipid sorting results from the collective behavior of lipids and is even ampliﬁed in the presence of lipid - clustering proteins . In addition , they suggest a generic mechanism by which proteins can facilitate lipid segrega - tion in vivo . cholera toxin (cid:1) giant unilamellar vesicle (cid:1) membrane curvature (cid:1) membrane nanotube (cid:1) optical tweezers L ipids and proteins are not homogeneously distributed among cell membranes ( 1 ) . How intracellular trafficking maintains the composition differences between the various membrane compartments of the cell is still poorly understood . In many cases , trafficking intermediates are tubular structures with radii typically in the range of 50 nm ( 2 ) . It has been suggested that lipid sorting could be mediated by a physical mechanism based on the coupling between membrane composition and the high curva - ture of these intermediates ( refs . 3 – 6 ; and see refs . 7 – 12 for theoretical papers ) and on solid substrate topography ( 13 ) . Added lipid or protein dyes have been shown to be sorted into or out of highly curved regions but without a systematic study of the influence of the underlying membrane composition on the sorting process ( 3 , 14 ) . It is crucial from a biological point of view to know whether the native membrane lipids themselves can be sorted by curvature and if so , whether or not the mechanism is robust for variable membrane compositions . In fact , a recent theoretical paper predicts a weak effect of curvature on mem - brane composition because of the overwhelming cost of mixing entropy , suggesting that curvature does not significantly con - tribute to sorting ( 15 ) . In contrast , we demonstrate in the present work that cooperative behavior between lipids is a critical requirement to offset the entropic cost . As a result , the effec - tiveness of curvature - based sorting is highly sensitive to the proximity of the membrane composition to phase separation . Membrane nanotubes pulled from multicomponent giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) by using micromanipulation tech - niques ( 16 ) are model systems perfectly suited to quantitatively validate the curvature - induced sorting hypothesis ( 17 ) . Their radii can be controlled by setting the membrane tension by micropipette aspiration and can span from 10 to 200 nm . In GUVs made of a ternary mixture of , for instance , sphingomyelin ( SM ) or brain sphingomyelin ( BSM ) , dioleylphosphatidylcholine ( DOPC ) and cholesterol ( Chol ) , different liquid lipid phases are observed depending on the relative proportion of each lipid : a liquid - disordered ( L d ) phase rich in DOPC or a liquid - ordered ( L o ) phase rich in SM ( 18 – 20 ) . Previous studies have shown that SM - rich membranes have a higher bending rigidity than DOPC - rich ones ( 14 , 16 , 19 ) . If lowering the bending energy in a curved membrane by adjusting the lipid composition contributes to sorting , one would expect a relative depletion of SM in regions of high curvature . This effect has been calculated to be small in ideal lipid mixtures ( 15 ) . However , lipid mixing in biological membranes is far from ideal ( 21 , 22 ) and lipid – lipid interactions could potentially aid curvature - driven lipid sorting . Similarly , these interactions can be changed by the presence of proteins , such as toxins that are able to bind and cluster a fraction of lipids . Thus , whether membrane curvature is sufficient to cause lipid sorting in pure lipid mixtures as well as in biological membranes remains an important and open question . In the present article , we have used 2 complementary ap - proaches to measure lipid sorting as a function of membrane curvature : ( i ) confocal microscopy to measure sorting coeffi - cients based on fluorescent lipid probes with different segrega - tion behavior between L o and L d phases and ( ii ) optical tweezers to measure the force necessary to pull the tube . We have also developed a sorting model based on reduction of bending rigidity that includes lipid – lipid interactions . The model predicts the evolution of the sorting coefficient and the force on the tube as functions of curvature . We demonstrate that the proximity to a demixing point is essential for curvature - induced lipid sorting in an otherwise homogeneous lipid mixture . Our experimental observations are fully consistent with the theoretical model . In addition , we have studied , theoretically and experimentally , the consequences on lipid sorting of adding cholera toxin B - subunit Author contributions : J . - F . J . , J . P . , B .

We first show that , regardless of the membrane composition , toxin - bound GM1 in the outer leaflet is depleted from the tube with increasing curvature . Unexpectedly , we also find that , in membranes close to a demixing point , lipid sorting is further amplified by toxin binding . This result indicates that lipid - clustering proteins may play an important role in curvature - induced sorting in biological membranes . Results and Discussion Sorting in Lipid Mixtures . To address the curvature - induced lipid sorting question , we have pulled membrane nanotubes of con - trolled radii from GUVs containing the ternary mixture BSM / Chol / DOPC . We have used 2 fluorescent lipids to detect lipid sorting : TexasRed - DHPE ( DHPE * ) , which strongly segregates in the L d phase ( 23 , 24 ) [ fluorescence ratio between L d and L o : I L D / I L O (cid:1) 65 (cid:2) 15 ( n (cid:1) 9 vesicles ) ] ( Fig . 1 A ) , and BodipyFL - GM1 ( GM1 * ) , which is equally distributed in the L d and L o phases ( I L D / I L O (cid:1) 1 . 25 (cid:2) 0 . 1 , n (cid:1) 9 vesicles ) ( Fig . 1 B ) . The incorporation of GM1 into GUV membrane was designed to allow binding of the B - subunit of cholera toxin . To address the question of curvature - induced sorting , we have built a setup combining confocal microscopy , optical tweezers , and micropipette aspira - tion [ see supporting information ( SI ) Fig . S1 ] . By reducing confocal illumination , photobleaching was not significant , and photo - induced phase separation ( 14 , 25 ) was not observed ( see SI Appendix and Fig . S2 ) . The membrane curvature was tuned by varying the tube radius , typically between 10 and 100 nm , through GUV aspiration ( 16 ) . To detect sorting , ( i ) we com - pared the fluorescence of the markers in the membrane tube and in the GUV equatorial plane ( Figs . 1 C and D ) at steady state ( Fig . S3 ) , and ( ii ) we measured the force f exerted by the membrane nanotube on the trapped bead . In a single - component membrane , the force f 0 is given by ( 26 ) f 0 (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) (cid:3) 2 (cid:3)(cid:4) , [ 1 ] where (cid:4) is the membrane tension set by the pipette aspiration ( 16 ) , and (cid:3) is the membrane bending rigidity . Departure of the square of the force , f 2 , vs . (cid:4) from linearity reflects a difference between tube and mother vesicle compositions . First , we established that no lipid sorting occurred in tubes pulled from homogenous L d phase vesicles . We considered vesicles of pure DOPC ( 0 : 0 : 100 ) , a mixture of DOPC and cholesterol ( 0 : 33 : 67 ) , and a mixture containing BSM , choles - terol , and DOPC ( 17 : 33 : 50 ) , all compositions being far from the phase separation limit ( shown on the phase diagram in Fig . 2 D ) . For these 3 compositions , containing 0 . 5 % DHPE * and 1 % GM1 * , we have measured the sorting ratio defined as the ratio between the fluorescence intensities of DHPE ( I t DHPE ) and of GM1 ( I t GM1 ) in the tube normalized by the same ratio in the vesicle ( I v DHPE / I v GM1 ) , corrected by a polarization factor ( PCF ) experi - mentally measured ( for details , see SI Appendix and Table S2 ) : Sorting (cid:1) 1 PCF (cid:5) (cid:4) I t DHPE / I t GM1 I v DHPE / I v GM1 (cid:5) . [ 2 ] In the following , we plot our data as a function of 4 (cid:2)(cid:4) / f (cid:1) C r , which is the reference tube curvature in the absence of sorting ( 26 ) . For the above 3 compositions , the sorting ratio is equal to unity and is independent of C r ( Fig . 2 A ) , showing no composi - tion change . In contrast , very different behavior is observed when more sphingomyelin is added , driving the mixture close to the phase boundary . For the 30 : 35 : 35 composition ( see Materials and Methods ) , a monotonic increase in the sorting ratio is observed when curvature is increased . Sorting becomes significant for tube radii (cid:3) 30 – 40 nm ( Figs . 1 C and D and 2 A ) . Analysis of the fluorescent lipid distribution shows an enrichment of DHPE * in the tube , consistent with SM depletion , whereas the GM1 * concentration remains constant as curvature increases ( Fig . S4 ) . Clearly , significant sorting of the fluorescent lipid markers can occur for compositions close to a phase boundary . Additional evidence for lipid sorting can be obtained from the force f needed to hold the membrane nanotube . This force is related to the membrane composition and thus should also be sensitive to lipid sorting . Indeed , for the 3 compositions far from the phase - separation boundary , a linear variation of f 2 as a function of membrane tension (cid:4) is observed , as expected if the composition remains unchanged in the tube ( Fig . 2 B for 0 : 0 : 100 and Fig . S5 for 0 : 33 : 67 and 17 : 33 : 50 ) . The slopes of these plots are proportional to the membrane bending rigidities ( Table S1 ) . In agreement with recent X - ray experiments ( 27 ) , we observed that the bending rigidity of DOPC membranes is unchanged upon addition of 30 % cholesterol . For the 30 : 35 : 35 composition , for which we have detected lipid sorting with fluorescence measurements , we observed a clear downward deviation from linear behavior ; the force is lower than expected in the absence of sorting for the same vesicle composition ( Fig . 2 B ) . This deviation is independent of the presence of GM1 * in the membrane , showing that the sorting effect on force is not a consequence of the labeling but only of this particular membrane composition ( Fig . S9 ) . This reduction in tube force provides direct evidence that a tube pulled from a vesicle with a compo - sition close to phase separation can have a significantly different composition from the vesicle membrane . Theoretically , the sorting of lipids between the tube and the vesicle is determined by a tradeoff between mixing and bending energies by excluding ( enriching ) those lipids with a tendency to form more ( less ) rigid bilayers . We developed a simple model that highlights the role of membrane tension , composition dependence of bending modulus , and mixing free energy based on an extension of the Helfrich membrane bending energy of the tube augmented by a Flory – Huggins mixing free energy for a Fig . 1 .

Minimizing Eq . 3 with respect to (cid:7) t gives the leading - order sorting (cid:11) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:7) t (cid:9) (cid:7) v (cid:5) (cid:1) (cid:9) (cid:3) (cid:9) v (cid:3) v (cid:4) f (cid:6) v . With (cid:3) (cid:9) v (cid:3) v (cid:6) 1 . 5 ( Table S1 ) , a significant sorting requires a large osmotic compressibility , that is , in the range of accessible tensions , f (cid:6) v (cid:3)(cid:3) k B T (cid:10) , (cid:10) being the lipid density and k B Boltz - mann’s constant . This condition is verified only near continuous phase separations , as this is the case for the 30 : 35 : 35 mixture . Note that we have neglected any asymmetry between the 2 leaflets in our approach ( 28 ) . The pulling force on the tube , obtained by minimizing Eq . 3 with respect to L , is : f (cid:6) 2 (cid:2) (cid:3) 2 (cid:3) v (cid:4) (cid:4) 1 (cid:9) (cid:4) 4 f v (cid:6) (cid:7) (cid:3) (cid:9) v (cid:3) v (cid:8) 2 (cid:5) ; [ 4 ] the second term in brackets is the leading correction to the pulling force due to sorting . Thus , a deviation from linearity of f vs . (cid:12) (cid:4) provides a quantitative measure of lipid sorting . Plotting f / (cid:12) (cid:4) vs . (cid:4) ( Fig . 2 C , Fig . S5 , and Table S1 ) , we observe a slope equal to zero for all tested compositions except for the compo - sition 30 : 35 : 35 , which demonstrates sorting in that mixture as expected from the above arguments . From Fig . 2 C , we deduce f v (cid:6) / kT (cid:10) (cid:7) 0 . 05 , consistent with this particular composition being close to phase separation . To further test this hypothesis , we explored how lipid sorting varies as a function of the distance from a demixing point in the phase diagram ( SI Appendix ) . When the SM / DOPC ratio is decreased at quasiconstant cholesterol fraction ( 26 : 35 : 39 and 23 : 34 : 43 mixtures ) , we observe that sorting becomes weaker as we move away from the phase boundary . Both the sorting coefficient and the magnitude of the slope of f / (cid:12) (cid:4) vs . (cid:4) decreases ( Fig . S6 a and Table S1 ) . Furthermore , another lipid composition at the phase limit ( 22 : 25 : 53 ) gives a sorting coef - ficient of the same order as the one obtained for the 30 : 35 : 35 mixture ( Table S1 and Fig . S6 b ) . The average slopes of f / (cid:12) (cid:4) versus (cid:4) obtained with various lipid compositions are summa - rized in Fig . 2 D . Altogether , the above data indicate that lipid sorting requires proximity to a demixing point . Effect of Toxin Binding on Lipid Sorting . Several groups have shown ( 22 , 29 , 30 ) that the pentameric B - subunit of the cholera - toxin ( CTxB ) , binding 5 GM1 lipids ( 31 ) , is able to induce phase separation in otherwise uniformly mixed membranes ( Fig . S7 ) . This suggests that , when lipids are bound to a protein , the osmotic compressibility of the lipid mixture can effectively rise . The influence of CTxB on curvature - induced lipid sorting is , however , not known and has not been investigated both theo - retically and experimentally . We thus repeated the fluorescence and force experiments described above with GUVs of the same lipid compositions but now in the presence of CTxB in solution . We checked that the amount of CTxB used was low enough to Fig . 2 . Curvature - driven lipid sorting occurs only close to a phase separation .

Interestingly , sorting was found to be significantly amplified in the vicinity of a phase separation in the presence of CTxB . For the 30 : 35 : 35 mixture , the sorting ratio of DHPE * to GM1 * is increased by CTxB binding ( Fig . 3 B ) . This could reveal either the coupling of CTxB concentration to curvature or the enhancement of lipid sorting by CTxB binding . As a control , we measured the sorting ratio of DHPE * to GM1 * in pure DOPC ( 0 : 0 : 100 ) and in mixtures far from phase sepa - ration ( 0 : 33 : 67 and 17 : 33 : 50 ) in the presence of CTxB . These experiments show a GM1 * depletion from the tube ( Fig . 3 A and Figs . S4 and S8 ) . Importantly , GM1 * depletion occurs for all tested compositions . This is consistent with experimental evi - dence showing that CTxB bound to the external leaflet of a GUV induces inward rather than outward bending deformation ( per - sonal communication ) , which suggests a physical mechanism by which CTxB / GM1 * complexes are depleted from tubes . GM1 depletion also corresponds to a CTxB depletion from the tube , as confirmed with experiments using fluorescent CTxB ( CTxB * ) binding to nonfluorescent GM1 ( Fig . S4 e ) . Interestingly , because of CTxB binding , GM1 is asymmetrically sorted . On the one hand , the sorting coefficient is (cid:3) 2 even at high curvature ( Fig . S8 ) when GM1 * is used , indicating that the inner leaflet remains unaffected by CTxB binding . On the other hand , a sorting coefficient (cid:13) 2 is obtained when fluorescent CTxB * is used in the same conditions ( Fig . S8 b ) . Compared with fluorescence exper - iments , force measurements do not exhibit any signature of lipid sorting for the 0 : 0 : 100 , 0 : 33 : 67 , and 17 : 33 : 50 mixtures ( Fig . 3 C for 0 : 0 : 100 and Fig . S5 for 0 : 33 : 67 and 17 : 33 : 50 ) . The measure - ment of the sorting ratio is thus a measure of CTxB exclusion only . Note that , in principle , even in the absence of lipid sorting , the force should depend on bound CTxB concentration , because of the possible CTxB dependence of the bending modulus and because of its preferred curvature ( SI Appendix ) . Our experi - ments show that this effect is negligible , because for all of the mixtures we investigated , f / (cid:12) (cid:4) at vanishing tension does not depend on the presence of CTxB ( Fig . 3 C and Table S1 ) . Force measurement on the 30 : 35 : 35 mixture , however , demonstrate a strong increase in sorting , reflected by a doubling of the slope of f / (cid:12) (cid:4) vs . (cid:4) from (cid:10) ( 4 . 6 (cid:2) 1 ) (cid:14) 10 (cid:10) 6 m 3 / 2 (cid:1) N (cid:10) 1 / 2 in the absence of toxin to (cid:10) ( 8 . 0 (cid:2) 2 ) (cid:14) 10 (cid:10) 6 m 3 / 2 (cid:1) N (cid:10) 1 / 2 in its presence ( Fig . 3 C and Table S1 ) . Note that the sorting is so effective that at large curvatures , the force approaches the value measured for 0 : 0 : 100 ( Fig . 3 C ) or 0 : 33 : 67 mixture ( Fig . S5 b ) , showing that the tube is completely depleted of SM . Fig . 3 A and B and Fig . S8 indicate that , except for the 30 : 35 : 35 mixture , the exclusion of CTxB / GM1 * complex is independent of vesicle composition . We rationalize these results by minimizing a free energy that includes contributions from mixing , bending and coupling between curvature and protein concentration ( SI Appendix ) . We find that the exclusion of protein complex , (cid:11) (cid:7) , increases linearly with tube curvature or , correct to this order , with (cid:12) (cid:4) and with , x , the number of lipids bound and clustered by a single toxin , which for CTxB is equal to 5 ( SI Appendix ) . We further find that in the small (cid:7) v limit , the fluorescence ratio is equal to 1 (cid:10) (cid:11) (cid:7) / 2 (cid:7) v , the factor of 2 reflecting that GM1 on the inner leaflet is unaffected by curvature ( SI Appendix ) . The fluorescence ratios in Fig . 3 A and Fig . S8 increase linearly with curvature , in agreement with our prediction . One expects that the sole effect of coupling between curvature and CTxB con - centration on the tube force is a downward shift in the bending modulus , proportional to the concentration of bound protein ( 8 ) . The fact that the forces for 0 : 0 : 100 in Fig . 3 C and in Fig . S5 for 0 : 33 : 67 and 17 : 33 : 50 show no difference whether CTxB is bound or not can be explained in view of the very low concentration of GM1 / CTxB complex in the membrane and of the proportionality of the force correction to the square of the coupling term , which is small in our system ( SI Appendix ) . The presence of bound protein does , however , have a mea - surable effect on the force behavior for the 30 : 35 : 35 mixture ( SI Appendix ) . We propose that the addition of CTxB has an amplifying effect on lipid sorting near a demixing transition . The physical reason for this is that , linking the GM1 * lipids in groups reduces the translational entropy of the lipids in the tube plus vesicle system . In other words , the balance between mixing entropy and enthalpy ( lipid – lipid interactions ) is shifted in favor of enthalpy , thus reducing the penalty for sorting . A simple calculation shows that the addition of CTxB leads to a fractional decrease of the inverse osmotic compressibility for sorting proportional to (cid:7) GM1 ( x (cid:10) 1 ) / f ( 0 ) (cid:6) , where (cid:7) GM1 is the area fraction of GM1 * in the vesicle , equal to 1 % , x is the number of GM1 * lipids bound to a single CTxB , equal to a maximum of 5 , and f ( 0 ) (cid:6) is the inverse osmotic compressibility in the absence of CTxB ( see SI Appendix ) . Therefore , even for a small concentration of GM1 * , the relative effect on sorting can be significant if f ( 0 ) (cid:6) is small , that is , near to the demixing point of the CTxB - free system . Conclusion We have shown here that lipid sorting can occur in lipid membranes by the formation of curved membrane structures without the help of any cellular protein machinery . Our first conclusion of this work is that lipid sorting is effective only near phase separation . This result seems to have been ignored so far in theoretical models . It cannot be obtained from a geometrical , molecular description and requires the consideration of the collective behavior of the lipids . There is strong evidence that biological plasma membranes and maybe some intracellular membranes are close to phase separation ( 1 , 22 , 23 ) , enhancing Fig . 3 . Cholera toxin B - subunit ( CTxB ) binding to GM1 enhances lipid sorting .

We found that the sorting of specific lipids can also be affected , independently of the membrane composition , by proteins , such as CTxB , that bind and cluster those lipids . Our last conclusion is that CTxB drives the lipid mixture closer to phase separation . This amplifies curvature - driven lipid sorting . This generic mechanism can be at work in cells for many proteins involved in the formation of transport intermediates . Materials and Methods GUVs . GUVs made of mixtures of brain sphingomyelin ( BSM ) , cholesterol ( Chol ) , and dioleylphosphatidylcholine ( DOPC ) were grown by using the electroformation technique ( 32 ) at 60 °C in 300 mOsm sucrose solution . BODIPY FL C5 - GM1 ( GM1 * ) was initially added at 1 % ( molar fraction , n / n ) to these lipid mixtures and TexasRed - DHPE ( DHPE * ) at 0 . 5 % ( molar fraction , n / n ) . To allow adhesion between the membrane and the streptavidin - coated beadsholdingthetubeinthetrap , 0 . 03 % ( n / n ) ofDSPE - PEG ( 2000 ) - Biotinwas addedtothelipidmixture . Lipidcompositionsareexpressedasmolefractions of BSM / Chol / DOPC . The 30 : 35 : 35 mixture corresponds to the closest compo - sition to the phase boundary where 100 % of the GUVs exhibit an homoge - neous ﬂuorescence at 35 % cholesterol . When used , CTxB was added at a concentration of 50 nM . Force and Tension Measurements , Tube Radius Calculation . The force f exerted by the tube was deduced from the displacement x (cid:10) x 0 of the bead from its equilibrium position x 0 in the optical trap by using the linear relationship f (cid:1) k ( x (cid:10) x 0 ) , where k isthetrapstiffness . Thebeadpositionwasmeasuredoff - line byvideotracking ( 16 ) . k wasdeterminedbytheviscousdragmethod ( 33 ) . The membrane tension (cid:4) was determined by using (cid:4) (cid:1) ( (cid:11) P (cid:1) R pip ) / 2 ( 1 (cid:10) R pip / R ves ) where R pip is the pipette radius , R ves the vesicle radius , and (cid:11) P the difference of hydrostatic pressure caused by the vertical displacement of the water reservoir linked to the pipette ( 34 ) . For each data point , the reference tube curvature C r in the absence of sorting was calculated from the independent measurements of f and (cid:4) by using C r (cid:1) 1 / r (cid:1) 4 (cid:2)(cid:4) / f ( 26 ) .
