Robinson 6 , 7 & Miklós nyitrai 1 , 2 , 5 * Here , we measured the concentrations of several ions in cultivated Gram‑negative and Gram‑positive bacteria , and analyzed their effects on polymer formation by the actin homologue MreB . We measured potassium , sodium , chloride , calcium and magnesium ion concentrations in Leptospira interrogans , Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli . intracellular ionic strength contributed from these ions varied within the 130 – 273 mM range . The intracellular sodium ion concentration range was between 122 and 296 mM and the potassium ion concentration range was 5 and 38 mM . However , the levels were significantly influenced by extracellular ion levels . L . interrogans , Rickettsia rickettsii and E . coli MreBs were heterologously expressed and purified from E . coli using a novel filtration method to prepare MreB polymers . The structures and stability of Alexa - 488 labeled MreB polymers , under varying ionic strength conditions , were investigated by confocal microscopy and MreB polymerization rates were assessed by measuring light scattering . MreB polymerization was fastest in the presence of monovalent cations in the 200 – 300 mM range . MreB filaments showed high stability in this concentration range and formed large assemblies of tape - like bundles that transformed to extensive sheets at higher ionic strengths . Changing the calcium concentration from 0 . 2 to 0 mM and then to 2 mM initialized rapid remodelling of MreB polymers . In bacterial cultures , the survivability of cells is influenced by extracellular salt effects , and cells adapt to changes in osmolarity by changing their intracellular ionic strength 1 . During the process of osmoadaptation , bacteria adjust to variant osmotic conditions by sodium / potassium uptake and release from and to the surrounding medium 2 . Many non - halophilic bacteria show a two - phase adaptation reaction to hyperosmotic shock 3 . In the first phase , the cells take up a large amount of K + via specific ion transport systems . This step is necessary to compensate for the efflux of water that occurs due to the increase in the exterior osmolality 4 . High intracel - lular concentrations of K + can have negative effects on protein function , protein binding to DNA and protein synthesis 5 , 6 . The second phase frequently involves the synthesis or uptake of compatible solutes 7 , 8 and the efflux of K + 3 , 4 . The osmotic shock response of E . coli causes an increase of intracellular Na + and K + concentrations up to several hundred millimolar 9 . In B . subtilis , the recovery of turgor after moderate osmotic change , by the addition of 0 . 4 M NaCl , increased intracellular K + levels from a basal value of 350 mM to 650 mM within 1 h 10 . Bacterial cell shape is determined by the structure of the cell wall . The cell wall is a rigid crosslinked mesh - work , the shape of which is maintained by the cellular turgor pressure . Bacteria can be subdivided into Gram - negative species that have a thin peptidoglycan layer and both an inner cytoplasmic and outer membrane , and Gram - positive species with only one cytoplasmic membrane and a thick peptidoglycan layer comprised largely of teichoic acids . Both types of bacteria use MreBs to organize peptidoglycan and teichoic acid synthesizing enzymes required for cell - wall assembly , growth and function 11 . The supramolecular morphology of MreB is known to be complex . Initial immunofluorescence microscopic studies with MreB fused to fluorescent proteins 12 , 13 indicated that MreB forms spiral - like patterns under the cell surface .

Important observations were made in three independent studies showing the coupling of the dynamics of MreB to cell - wall synthesis in two evolutionary different species ; Gram - negative Escherichia coli 16 and Gram - positive Bacillus subtilis 14 , 15 . These results established that MreB polymers rotate around the long axis of the cell on a time scale of minutes . Although MreB functions had previously been related to its polymerization , these studies showed that the rotational motion was dependent on cell - wall synthesis activity . If cell - wall precursors were depleted , or cell - wall synthesis enzymes were inhibited with antibiotic drugs , MreB rotation stopped . MreB appears to coordinate the activity of enzymes involved in bacterial growth 17 , 18 . E . coli rapidly restores its cytoplasmic volume after osmotic shock 19 , and short polymers of MreB are required for the recovery of the rod shape 20 . A minimal degree of rotational motion by MreB polymers is needed to maintain cell shape , however this seems to be independent of the intracellular turgor pressure 21 . MreB is linked to the cell wall via RodZ 20 in order to manage peptidoglycan insertion . Cell recovery after osmotic shock initially proceeds at a slow growth rate until the inner membrane , with bound MreB , can reattach to the cell wall , whereupon normal growth rates are restored 22 . Furthermore , inhibition of MreB polymerization with the drug A22 led to the loss of cell shape 23 , indicating an interdependence of MreB polymerization and cell wall synthesis . Kawei and colleagues used a co - immunoprecipitation assay combined with mass spectroscopy to identify proteins that interact with either of the three B . subtilis MreB isoforms ; MreB , Mbl , and MreBH . More than 100 potential MreB - interacting proteins were identified . They concluded that MreB may provide a scaffold for cell - wall synthesis enzymes and cytoplasmic enzymes required for building cell - wall precursors . By contrast , Escherichia coli cells can grow in the complete absence of MreB 24 , suggesting that while MreB may enhance the efficiency of cell wall synthesis , it is not essential for the process . A possible alternative interpretation is that MreB spatially determines or constrains the potential sites of cell - wall synthesis , as suggested by Furchtgott et al . 25 and by van Teeffelen et al . 16 . In silico modelling of a growing cell wall showed that helical and stiff arrangements of MreB polymers may stabilize the rod - like cell shape in Gram - negative bacteria by enabling a uniform density of peptidoglycan insertion events in the cell wall . This mechanism assumes stiff MreB filaments that bridge the spatial gaps in the cell wall 26 . In vitro high salt conditions can cause MreB polymers to stack into stable sheets 27 . Such morphologies may be related to the in vivo functions , as MreB structures arranged in helical patterns are required for inner membrane and cell shape stability 28 . However , the roles of the inherent dynamic properties , remodelling and reorganization of MreB in the cell wall maintenance and cell division still need to be clarified . In vitro solution conditions have significant effects on the organization and function of MreB . Intracellular ion levels can prevent MreB’s spontaneous assembly while allowing for site - specific assembly of short polymers 27 , 29 , 30 . MreB polymerization was also shown to be sensitive to the type of bound nucleotide 31 . Polymerization of MreB from Thermotoga maritima ( Tm - MreB ) can be initiated by the addition of ATP . The rate of polymerization accelerates with increasing MgCl 2 concentration 32 , while CaCl 2 does not have a marked influence on the process . However , calcium influx plays an important role in cell cycle and chemotaxis of E . coli cells 33 . Several important questions remain regarding the roles of ions in the structure and function of MreB filaments . Which ions are essential for the stability for MreB polymers , what conditions can mobilize the MreB cytoskeleton , and how the balance between assembly and disassembly is regulated by ionic changes , all require further investigation . Due to the characteristic helical morphology of the Leptospira interrogans cells , which is remarkably distinct from rod - shaped bacteria , these cells provide an exciting platform to understand the molecular basis of the organization and function of MreB polymers 34 . The phylum Spirochaetes comprises organisms that have distinct cellular morphologies ranging from helical to flat wave - shaped cells . Leptospira interrogans has a long ( ~ 10 μm ) but thin ( ~ 0 . 2 μm ) helical cell shape and its motility is driven by the rotation of two periplasmic flagella . These bacteria use the flagella to create corkscrew motility . Currently it is not known whether the formation of the cell wall in these cells relies on a different mechanism of their peptidoglycan synthesis . Also , only limited information is available about the set of proteins participating in the process , though the MreBs of Leptospira interrogans is likely to have a role in controlling cell morphology 35 . Here we have analyzed the intracellular ionic conditions in Escherichia coli and Leptospira interrogans as examples Gram - negative bacteria species , and Bacillus subtilis as a Gram - positive bacteria species . We have characterized the polymerization of MreBs from different Gram - negative species , Leptospira interrogans MreB ( Li - MreB ) and Rickettsia rickettsii MreB ( Rr - MreB ) in vitro , under various ionic conditions . We compared the properties of Li - MreB and Rr - MreB polymers to Escherichia coli MreB ( Ec - MreB ) filaments as a reference . Based on these data , we propose a model for the regulation of MreB assembly and remodelling by ion flux . Results intracellular ion concentrations in bacteria . Ion - selective electrode / colorimetry is able to measure concentrations of free ions , while flame photometry measures the total concentrations of ions , including ions bound to proteins and DNA . To compare these two methods , we measured the intracellular concentration of Na + , K + and Ca 2 + in samples extracted from Escherichia coli using both ion - selective electrode / colorimetry and flame photometry . The two methods detected similar concentrations of the three ions ( Fig . 1A ) ( with no sta - tistically significant difference , p > 0 . 05 ) , indicating that the ion extraction method used here was effective in releasing the majority of bound ions . Ion - selective electrode / colorimetry is able to measure more types of ions than flame photometry , therefore in subsequent experiments only ion - selective electrode / colorimetry was used to measure ion concentrations ( including Na + , K + , Ca 2 + , Mg 2 + and Cl − ) . Our aim was to understand whether a relationship exists between the intracellular ionic conditions and the cell shapes of two Gram - negative spe - cies , Leptospira interrogans ( Li ) , which is a Spirochaete with a helical shape , and Escherichia coli ( Ec ) with rod - shaped cell morphology . For comparison , we examined a Gram - positive species Bacillus subtilis ( Bs ) , which also 3 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) Scientific RepoRtS | ( 2020 ) 10 : 12002 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 020 - 68960 - w www . nature . com / scientificreports / has a rod - shaped cell . The ion concentrations determined in all three species are presented in Fig . 1B . Sodium ion concentrations were high in all three species : 296 ± 12 mM in Li , 219 ± 42 mM in Ec and 122 ± 11 mM in Bs , and show statistically significant differences . By contrast , potassium ion concentrations were relatively low : 38 ± 10 mM and 27 ± 10 mM in Ec and Bs , respectively , and significantly lower 5 ± 1 mM in Li . The calcium ion concentration was 1 ± 0 . 08 mM ( significantly higher than for Ec and Bs ) and the magnesium concentration was 0 . 38 ± 0 . 2 mM in Li ( statistically significantly lower than for the other two species ) . Interestingly , in Ec and Bs the calcium ion concentrations were sub - millimolar , while the magnesium ion concentration was between 1 and 2 mM . Chloride ions are known to be the major anion composition of bacterial cells . Here , we measured the chloride ion concentrations to be 164 ± 0 . 7 , 207 ± 41 and 106 ± 13 mM in Li , Ec and Bs , respectively ( there is a statistically significant difference only between Li and Ec ) . Na + , K + , Cl − , Ca 2 + , and Mg 2 + are the major contribu - tors to intracellular ionic strength 36 – 38 . Calculation ( Eq . 1 ) of the intracellular ionic strengths in the differences species , based on these ions , gave values of 235 mM ( Li ) , 237 mM ( Ec ) and 130 mM ( Bs ) . Despite of the different levels between species , the ratios between various ions in a single species were similar between the three species . polymerization of MreB under various salt conditions . To assess the impact of the different ion conditions on MreB polymer formation , we overexpressed MreBs from three Gram - negative species [ E . coli , Leptospira interrogans and Rickettsia rickettsii ( Rr ) ] in E . coli . The MreBs were subsequently purified with a novel polymer filtration method ( PF ) and a previously published denaturation method 39 . In the PF method MreBs were polymerized under high salt conditions ( 50 – 300 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ) and then filtered ( Supp . 1A , B , C ) . In a previous study , the filament - forming properties of Li - MreB were characterized by following polymerization through measuring the increase in light scattering on polymerization 39 . The optimal salt condition for Li - MreB polymerization was determined to be 300 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 . However , in our present study we determined that Rr - MreB required only 200 mM KCl for optimal polymeriza - tion ( Supp . 2B , C , D ) in the presence of MgCl 2 ( 2 mM ) and CaCl 2 ( 0 . 1 mM ) . In the absence of magnesium ions , Rr - MreB shows no increase in light scattering indicative of the absence of polymerization , similar to the proper - ties observed for Li - MreB ( Supp . 2E ) 39 . In the absence of potassium ions , the light scattering level was elevated in response to the addition of millimolar concentrations of divalent cations , which was caused by the precipitation of Rr - MreB ( Supp . 2E ) . To enable imaging of MreB polymers , the MreBs were labeled with Alexa488 - maleimide . We have previously shown that Alexa - 488 labeling had no significant effect on the functional properties of Li - MreB 39 . In 300 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , Li - MreB formed large bundled assemblies ( Fig . 2A ) while Rr - MreB formed extensive sheets ( Fig . 2C ) . Li - MreB formed similar assemblies in 300 mM NaCl as in 300 mM KCl , indicating that sodium and potassium may have similar effects on MreB assembly ( Supp . 2F ) . Li - MreB purified with the PF method under the salt composition determined for Li cells ( 296 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 0 . 38 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 , ) formed similar superstructures based on the interlacement of curved rib - bon - like sheets ( Fig . 2B ) as in the presence of 300 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ( Fig . 2A ) ( Supp . Movie 1 ) . The KCl sensitivity of Rr - MreB polymerization shows an optimum ( Supp . 2C ) at 200 mM and formed similar Figure 1 . Intracellular ion concentrations in bacteria .

Li - MreB and Ec - MreB formed similar structures in the presence of 300 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ( Fig . 2A and E ) , which resembled the Ec - MreB assemblies purified under the intracellular salt composition ( 219 mM NaCl , 38 mM KCl , 2 . 38 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 24 mM CaCl 2 ) ( Fig . 2F ) . Reorganization of MreB polymers by changes in calcium levels . Li - MreB shows monovalent cat - ion dependent sensitivity to calcium ion concentrations in the range of 0 . 1 – 2 mM . In the absence of KCl and MgCl 2 , a fivefold increase in light scattering was observed on the addition of 2 mM CaCl 2 to Li - MreB mono - mers ( 50 µM ) . However , in the presence of 300 mM KCl and 2 mM MgCl 2 the signal from the polymers was unchanged on the calcium addition ( dashed line in Fig . 3A ) . Similar effects were observed for Rr - MreB ( Fig . 3B ) . To further investigate these effects , we carried out time - lapse microscopy imaging to explore any structural changes of fluorescently labeled Li - MreB polymers in response to calcium treatment . The initial large assemblies ( gray , Fig . 3C ) , appeared to shorten and become less flexible after 5 min ( cyan , Fig . 3C ) and 10 min ( green , Fig . 3C ) on the addition of 2 mM CaCl 2 ( Movie 1 ) . White arrows in Fig . 3C indicate the shortening of the MreB assembly , by the contraction of the whole structure . At the start , the superstructure moves relatively freely . After calcium treatment , the thermal motion of the superstructure slowed and stopped . Both characteristics suggest a calcium - induced structural change in the MreB assembly . However , after 6 mM EDTA treatment in 300 mM KCl , in the absence of divalent cations , the Li - MreB and Rr - MreB polymers precipitated ( Fig . 3D and E ) . The addition of 6 mM EGTA , rather than EDTA , in the absence of calcium ions , led to the Li - MreB superstructures remodelling into a single ribbon - like sheet ( Fig . 3F ) ( Supp . Movie 2 ) , while Rr - MreB formed irregular bundled assemblies ( Fig . 3G ) . These data show that calcium influences the formation of MreB polymer superstructures . To better understand the role of calcium , we carried out experiments in which the responses of polymers were monitored by light scattering on fast changes in calcium ion concentrations . In the presence of 6 mM EGTA , where free calcium was eliminated from the solution , the addition of 2 mM Ca 2 + led to a jump in light scattering ( black line in Fig . 4A ) , which subsequently decreased slowly , indicating a moderate size change of the Li - MreB ( 50 µM ) polymers . Similarly , after extended incubation with 2 mM CaCl 2 followed by a sudden switch to EGTA ( 6 mM ) a fast increase in light scattering was observed ( orange line in Fig . 4A ) followed by a gradual decrease , indicating that the Li - MreB polymers went through a relatively quick supramolecular reorganization . Likewise , a sudden change of calcium level , by consecutive application of EGTA then calcium , had a similar effect on Rr - MreB sheets indicated by a rapid increase in light scattering ( Fig . 4B ) . To explore how calcium affects MreB poly - mers in the presence of EGTA , we followed the change with fluorescence microscopy . Alexa488 labeled Li - MreB assemblies in the presence of 2 mM CaCl 2 were dissociated and precipitated after the addition of 6 mM EGTA ( Fig . 4C ) , explaining the quick change of light scattering after this treatment ( Fig . 4A , orange line ) . Surprisingly , in the presence of 6 mM EGTA , Li - MreB polymers formed novel web - like structures after 2 mM CaCl 2 addition ( Fig . 4D ) as was also the case for Rr - MreB ( Fig . 4E ) and Ec - MreB ( Fig . 4F ) polymers . Possibly , magnesium can replace calcium in binding to the MreB polymers to stabilize the assemblies , since the elimination of calcium by EGTA in the presence of magnesium did not affect the MreB assemblies . Subsequent addition of calcium , in excess of the local EGTA concentration , reorganized the MreB filaments . Microscopy images of whole cell lysate from E . coli overexpressing Li - MreB or Rr - MreB ( Fig . 4G and H , respectively ) , in which all cysteines of the entire sample were labeled with Alexa488 - maleimide , showed extensive web - like structures after treatment with EGTA ( 6 mM ) followed by CaCl 2 ( 2 mM excess ) . This indicates that changes in intracellular calcium levels may play a role in intracellular polymer reorganization . the persistence length of MreB under various salt conditions . Since ionic conditions have substan - tial effects on MreB polymerization and superstructure reorganization , we sought to characterize the flexibility of MreB polymers under various salt conditions . We analyzed the microscope images with Easyworm software to estimate the persistence lengths of the MreB structures . Ionic strength was effective in changing the polym - erization properties of Rr - MreB ( Supp . 2B , C , D ) , therefore the persistence length was examined as the function of the KCl concentration ( Fig . 5A ) . The buffers contained different amounts of KCl ( 50 – 300 mM ) and 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 . Persistence lengths were ionic strength dependent and fell in the range of 3 . 9 – 35 . 5 µm ( images not shown ) . Interestingly , the optimal polymerization conditions of Rr - MreB ( 200 mM KCl ) resulted the longest persistence length and the lowest flexibility of polymers . However , the persistence lengths of Li - MreB and Rr - MreB polymers in the presence of 300 mM KCl were similar ( 14 . 6 µm ) , indicating similar flexibilities . For reference , in the case of actin , the persistence length is 12 µm in the activated state of the thin filaments , in the presence of calcium and binding of the tropomyosin - troponin complex 40 . The persistence length of ADP - bound state of the actin filaments is 9 ± 0 . 5 µm , while the filaments become much stiffer in the absence of calcium ( 20 ± 1 µm ) . The persistence lengths estimated here for MreB superstructures varied within a broad range ( 3 . 9 – 35 . 5 µm ) , which is similar to the range observed for actin filaments . Interestingly , in the presence of 100 mM KCl the persistence length of Rr - MreB ( 25 . 73 ± 9 . 3 µm ) polymers was similar to the values of actin thin filaments in the absence of calcium ( 20 ± 1 µm ) 40 . These data indicate a potential role of calcium in remodeling of MreB superstructures . In the presence of 300 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 the persistence length of Li - MreB , Rr - MreB and Ec - MreB polymers were almost identical ( Fig . 5B ) around 13 µm . On addition of 2 mM CaCl 2 , the persistence lengths of Li - MreB and Rr - MreB polymers increased to 23 – 25 µm , the filaments stiffened . In the absence of calcium ( 6 mM EGTA ) , both MreBs were more flexible ( Lp ~ 6 µm ) , and subsequent calcium addition ( 2 mM ) caused reorganization of MreBs resulting in slightly stiffer structures and significantly different persistence length Li - MreB ( Lp = 8 . 9 µm ) , Rr - MreB ( Lp = 15 . 4 µm ) and Ec - MreB ( Lp = 11 . 69 µm ) . 6 Vol : .

These methods reveal the average intracellular ion conditions and do not report inhomogeneous distributions in different areas of a cell . Nevertheless , the agreement between the Na + , K + and Ca 2 + levels , measured by the two techniques , suggests that these average values are accurate , and that in general the levels of sodium ions exceed potassium ions in bacteria . Bacterial cells can exchange monovalent cations with the media to adjust intracellular ionic strength during osmoadaptation 41 . The types of broth used here in growing bacterial cultures were major source of sodium ions . The conditions for culturing Leptospira inter - rogans ( Korthof ) , Escherichia coli ( Luria – Bertani ) and Bacillus subtilis ( Mueller – Hinton ) contain 54 , 85 and 342 mM sodium ions , respectively , which show a different relationship to the measured intracellular sodium ion concentrations , Leptospira interrogans ( 296 mM ) , Escherichia coli ( 219 mM ) and Bacillus subtilis ( 122 mM ) . We measured almost identical intracellular ion concentration - derived ionic strengths in Leptospira interrogans ( 235 mM ) and Escherichia coli ( 237 mM ) , which mainly resulted from sodium and chloride ions . The intracel - lular ionic strength in Bacillus subtilis was significantly lower ( 130 mM ) , suggesting that non - ion osmolytes may have a significant role in maintaining the osmotic balance . The in vitro polymerization and formation of MreB superstructures is highly dependent on the presence of cations . Millimolar magnesium and hundred millimolars potassium or sodium are necessary for efficient MreB polymerization . Addition of calcium caused the stacking into ribbon - like structures and large assemblies , and we hypothesize that calcium binding may change the strain in filaments . Subsequent calcium depletion , via EGTA treatment , reordered the polymers into extensive sheets in the presence of magnesium , and further treatment with calcium led to fissured monolayer sheets and the dissociation of filaments into web - like structures ( Fig . 6 ) . Structural studies have shown that pairs of MreB protofilaments associate together in an antiparallel manner , while molecular dynamics simulations suggest the possibility of curvature in the protofilaments 42 , 43 . The in vitro assemblies observed here are likely to be formed by the non - polarized filaments associating side by side . In vivo the assemblies will also be stabilized by membrane binding 43 . Molecular dynamics simulations have shown that the twist of MreB double protofilaments can be reduced by membrane binding . The moderated dynamics of MreB filaments resulted in shorter filaments , and possibly provides tuning to their flexibilty and length 44 . The untwisted antiparallel structure of pairs of protofilaments can allow bending of the MreB filaments , which may stabilize the curvature of a membrane 44 . High calcium concentrations 45 , near a membrane , may induce longer persistence lengths in MreB polymers . Thus , we hypothesize that local calcium concentration changes may lead to the reshaping of membranes . Through calcium - ion induced stiffness , MreB filaments may contribute to Figure 5 . Persistence lengths of different MreB assemblies . ( A ) Analysis of microscopy images fitting with the WLC model in the Easyworm software . Alexa488 - labeled Rr - MreB polymers were grown under different KCl conditions ( 50 – 400 mM ) , which reveals the longest persistence length at its polymerization optimum at 200 mM of KCl ( blue circles ) . The persistence length of Alexa488 labeled Li - MreB is shorter at its polymerization optimum at 300 mM KCl ( red circle ) . ( B ) The persistence length of Alexa488 - labeled Li - MreB assemblies ( red columns ) changed significantly in the presence of 2 mM calcium , and in the absence of calcium by the treatment with 6 mM EGTA , and Rr - MreB assemblies ( blue columns ) showed a non - significant change in the presence of 2 mM calcium , but a significant change in the presence of 6 mM EGTA . Both assemblies show non - significant differences to the pretreated samples on subsequent addition of 2 mM calcium after EGTA treatment . The persistence length of Alexa488 - labeled Ec - MreB assemblies ( green columns ) did not show a large difference on the addition of 6 mM EGTA followed by 2 mM calcium . Error bars refer to mean ± SD of five independent measurements . Double asterisks indicate statistically significant difference relative to the initial conditions . The analysis was based on a two - sample t - test , p < 0 . 005 . 9 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) Scientific RepoRtS | ( 2020 ) 10 : 12002 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 020 - 68960 - w www . nature . com / scientificreports / specifying membrane curvature at points of membrane - MreB interaction ( Supp . 4 ) . Presumably , the final cell shape will be a product of the MreB properties and the ionic milieu . Calcium concentration - induced changes of MreB structure may also participate in membrane remodelling during cell division or osmotic adaptation . Rr - MreB polymerization is more sensitive to monovalent cations than Li - MreB , which suggests that the shape and stability of cytoskeletal systems will vary between organisms under similar intracellular conditions . Since , the high salt conditions present in bacteria fluctuate in response to osmotic shock , the influence on the stability of MreB scaffold and its ability to reattach bacterial membranes to cell wall is likely to be affected by divalent cations .

( 1234567890 ) Scientific RepoRtS | ( 2020 ) 10 : 12002 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 020 - 68960 - w www . nature . com / scientificreports / Varying ionic conditions do not in general change cell shape , however they are known to modify membrane stiffness and enzyme activity , which effects the stability of bacterial envelope 46 . However , the effect of calcium levels appears to be more sensitive . It is likely that calcium fluxes may have a role in regulating and remodelling the in vivo MreB cytoskeleton , which in turn may influence the mobility and localization of links between the membrane and cell wall during the cell division . One of the limitations of our study is that due to the limited number of species analyzed , it is not clear whether the differences seen are species specific or common features of several relative strains . But we highlighted the relevance of intracellular ion conditions influence on MreB polymer formation . Methods Determination of intracellular ion concentrations . The Escherichia coli , Bacillus subtilis and Lepto - spira interrogans cells ( gifts from the Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology ) were grown until OD 600nm = 1 in suitable media . Luria – Bertani broth for E . coli : 10 g / L tryptone , 5 g / L yeast extract , 5 g / L NaCl ; Mueller – Hinton broth for B . subtilis : 2 g / L meat infusion , 17 . 5 g / L casein hydrolysate , 1 . 5 g / L starch ; Korthof broth for L . interrogans : 1 . 4 g / L NaCl , 0 . 88 g / L Na 2 HPO 4 , 0 . 8 g / L peptone , 0 . 24 g / L KH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 04 g / L CaCl 2 , 0 . 04 g / L KCl , 0 . 02 g / L NaHCO 3 , added rabbit serum and rabbit hemoglobin ( sterile 8 mL inactivated blood serum and 0 . 8 mL sterile haemoglobin solution were added in 100 mL broth ) . Cells were harvested by centrifugation ( 4500 × g for 10 min ) , then the extracellular medium was removed by washing . Five times the pellet volume of distilled water was added , incubated for 2 min at RT , and subsequently inverted gently ten times and centrifuged again ( 4500 × g for 10 min ) . The pellet volume was measured in a scaled 2 mL Eppendorf tube . Cells killed and the extracellular water was evaporated by heat treatment ( 100 °C for 20 min ) . The cell pellets were resuspended in five times the pellet volume of water , frozen and subsequently boiled to generate a homogenous cell lysate . The slurry was centrifuged for 10 min at 100 , 000 × g . Ion concen - trations were measured from the supernatants . Unbound Na + , K + , Cl − ( ion - selective electrode ) Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ( colorimetry ) levels were analyzed using a COBAS INTEGRA 400 plus analyzer ( Roche Diagnostics , GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . Total ( protein - bound and free ) Na + , K + and Ca 2 + were also measured by flame photometry ( Efox 5053 / Eppendorf ) . The intracellular ion concentrations are equal to five times of measured values . The final ionic strength ( IS ) was derived using the following equation : where c i and z i are the molar concentrations and charge of the ions , respectively . Expression of MreB . The Leptospira interrogans MreB gene ( gene bank accession number : AAS69864 . 1 ) , the Rickettsia rickettsii MreB gene ( gene bank accession number : ABY73136 . 1 ) and the Escherichia coli MreB gene ( gene bank accession number : AJF45056 . 1 ) sequences were codon optimized for expression in E . coli , synthesized ( GenScript ) and engineered into the pSY5 plasmid which encodes an 8 - histidine tag , followed by a PreScission protease ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) cleavage site prior to the protein sequence . The construct was verified by DNA sequencing . The DNA construct encoding MreB was transformed into E . coli BL21 DE3 pLysS strain ( Novagen ) . Cell cultures were grown in Luria Broth medium at 37 °C supplemented with ampicillin until reaching OD600 = 0 . 6 . Protein expression was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM followed by incubation overnight at 20 °C . Cells were harvested by centrifugation and pellets were stored at − 20 °C 39 . Purification of MreB . We used a novel method for the isolation of MreB polymers , which we refer to as the polymer filtration ( PF ) method . E . coli cell pellets were resuspended in a buffer consisting of 2 mM TRIS . HCl , 50 – 300 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT ( pH 8 . 0 ) . The slurry was treated with DNase ( 0 . 01 U / mL ) ( PanReac , AppliChem ) and lysozyme ( 0 . 01 mg / mL ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) overnight at 4 °C . MreB polymers ( Supp . 3C ) were filtered first on a paper filter and then washed and filtered again on a 0 . 45 µm membrane filter . The purity of MreB stocks were assessed with SDS - PAGE ( Supp . 1 ) ( Supp . 1C was cropped from Supp . 3D ) . For the comparison of MreB polymers prepared by the PF method , we also purified MreB monomers on a Ni – NTA column under denaturating conditions with minor changes of protocol what we published before 39 . A cell pellet was resuspended and homogenized in a denaturing lysis buffer ( 6 M guanidine - HCl , 0 . 1 M NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM TRIS . HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) . After centrifugation ( 30 , 000 × g at 4 °C for 2 h ) the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni – NTA column and incubated overnight at 4 °C . Then the column was washed with a buffer containing 8 M urea , 0 . 1 M NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM TRIS . HCl . A descending pH gradient from pH 8 . 0 to 4 . 0 was applied to elute the protein . MreB containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against a buffer containing 2 mM TRIS . HCl , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT , pH 8 . 0 ) in order to refold the MreB monomers . The rena - tured MreB were clarified by ultracentrifugation ( 100 , 000 × g , 4 °C , 30 min ) . The MreB stocks were either used immediately or flash - frozen with liquid nitrogen in small volumes . Concentrations of MreBs were determined by Bradford Assay ( Bio - Rad ) using a Jasco v - 660 photometer ( Jasco Corporation ) . fluorescent labeling of MreB . The cysteines of MreBs were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide or with Alexa Fluor 568 C5 maleimide . Prior to initiating of the labeling reaction , DTT was removed from the solution by overnight dialysis . Next , MreB polymers were incubated in the presence of fivefold molar excess of the fluorophore for 1 h on ice . The excess fluorophore was removed by overnight dialysis . However , labeled ( 1 ) [ IS ] = 1 2 n (cid:31) i = 1 c i z i 11 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) Scientific RepoRtS | ( 2020 ) 10 : 12002 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 020 - 68960 - w www . nature . com / scientificreports / MreB polymers were not but monomers were clarified by ultracentrifugation ( 100 , 000 × g , at 4 °C for 30 min ) and the concentrations of protein and fluorophore in the supernatant were determined using spectrophotom - etry ( ε Alexa488 = 73 , 000 M −1 cm −1 , ε Alexa568 = 88 , 000 M −1 cm −1 , ε LiMreB = 10 , 555 M −1 cm −1 , ε RrMreB = 15 , 025 M −1 cm −1 , ε EcMreB = 7575 M −1 cm −1 ) . The ratio of labeling was calculated as the concentration ratio of the probe to the pro - tein and was found to be approximately 0 . 1 in cases of MreB polymers and more than 0 . 5 in case of monomers . in vitro polymerization and polymer remodelling assays of MreB . The polymerization kinetics of MreB was investigated using light scattering assays with a Perkin Elmer LS - 50 spectrofluorimeter . The excitation and emission monochromators were set to wavelength 400 nm and the excitation and emission slits to 2 . 5 nm . The samples ( 2 mL ) were stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer during the polymerization process . Polym - erization was initiated by adding monovalent and / or divalent cations , as indicated . The same set up was used to study the time dependent and ionic concentration dependent morphology changes of MreB polymers . The settings for the method based on our protocol and experience 39 . fluorescence microscopy . In these experiments 15 μL of fluorescent labeled MreB was dropped on slides , incubated in the presence of a buffer containing 300 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , unless otherwise indicated , then covered by coverslips . The morphologies of the labeled MreB assemblies were analyzed using a Leica TCS SP confocal scanning microscope system ( Leica Microsystems GmbH Germany ) equipped with a 10 - 63X objective lens . Image acquisition was carried out a fluorescent - probe specific wavelengths , Alexa488 ( ex . : 488 nm , em . : 515 – 560 nm ) and with Alexa568 ( ex . : 543 nm , em . : 600 – 700 nm ) . The typical vertical stacking height of images was 1 – 3 µm . Determination of persistence length of MreB assemblies . To determine the persistence length of the filaments we used Easyworm , an open - source software tool used to determine the mechanical properties of protein chains ( Lamour et al . ; licensee BioMed Central Ltd . 2014 ) , coded in MATLAB 47 . Representative confo - cal microscopy images were selected and fitted with the worm - like chain ( WLC ) model . Resultant persistence lengths ( Lp ) were calculated from the function of End2End length versus contour length of assemblies . Data analysis . Data are presented as means ± standard deviations ( SD ) throughout . Comparisons were performed using Students T - test and statistically significant differences between groups were defined as p val - ues < 0 . 05 or < 0 . 005 and are indicated in the legends of figures .
