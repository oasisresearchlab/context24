LOW Department of Physics , McGill University , Montr´eal , Qu´ebec , Canada Abstract . T cells undergo large shape changes ( morphodynamics ) when migrating . While progress has been made elucidating the molecular basis of cell migration , statistical characteriza - tion of morphodynamics and migration has been limited , particularly in physiologically realistic 3D environments . A previous study ( H . Cavanagh et al . , J . R . Soc . Interface 19 : 20220081 ) found discrete states of dynamics as well as periodic oscillations of shape . However , we show that these results are due to artifacts of the analysis methods . Here , we present a revised analysis of the data , applying a method based on an underdamped Langevin equation . We ﬁnd that diﬀerent shape modes have diﬀerent correlation times . We also ﬁnd novel non - Gaussian eﬀects . This study provides a framework in which quantitative comparisons of cell morphodynamics and migration can be made , e . g . between diﬀerent biological conditions or mechanistic models . 1 . Introduction Eﬃcient migration of leukocytes ( immune cells ) is crucial to mounting an eﬀective immune response . Leukocytes must travel through various microenvironments in order to scan tissues for targets such as pathogens , antigen , or other cells [ 1 ] . Cell migration depends fundamentally on remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton . Leukocyte migra - tion can occur spontaneously or as a result of extracellular cues such as chemokine , and is enabled by protrusion of pseudopods containing a branched actin network at the front and contraction of actomyosin bundles at the back [ 2 ] , occurring in some contexts as a cyclical process [ 3 ] . It has been proposed that actin protrusions play an exploratory role but are dispensable for migration [ 4 , 5 ] . Meanwhile , an actin cortex maintains the integrity of the cell shape . The cells have a polarized shape , with a rounded or wide cell front while the cell rear contains a thin cylindrical structure called the uropod [ 6 ] . Membrane material for large shape changes is provided by microvilli , which cover the cells [ 7 ] . Leukocytes utilize a fast mode migration termed “amoeboid” , so named due to their large shape changes and similarity to the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum [ 8 ] . This migration mode is further characterized by weak adhesion and typically does not involve proteolysis of the extracellular matrix [ 9 – 11 ] . While many studies have analyzed cell migration in 2D , it is more physiologically realistic to consider 3D migration [ 12 ] . On 2D surfaces , leukocytes use adhesion receptors ( such as integrins ) to anchor the cell during protrusion [ 13 ] ; however , in 3D environments they are able to use an adhesion - independent mode of migration , using a “ﬂowing and squeezing” mechanism instead E - mail address : yeeren . low @ mail . mcgill . ca . 1 2 QUANTIFYING T CELL MORPHODYNAMICS AND MIGRATION IN 3D COLLAGEN MATRICES [ 14 ] , and they are also able to use topography to generate motion [ 15 ] . However , determination of the actual mechanism underlying migration is complicated by adaptability [ 10 ] . Leukocyte migration can be characterized as a search problem , and diﬀerent types of random walks have been proposed to describe it [ 16 ] . Migration is modulated by both environmental and cell - intrinsic factors [ 17 – 19 ] , and molecular perturbations are seen to modify turning behavior [ 20 , 21 ] . Turning to the underpinnings of cell locomotion , actin waves have been observed in a variety of cell types and are thought to underlie cell migration . They are hypothesized to arise from an ex - citable system [ 22 , 23 ] . Membrane tension is proposed to act as a global negative feedback to restrict protrusive activity around the cell surface [ 24 ] . In 2D migration of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum , the molecular workings of the excitable system have been recently elucidated [ 25 – 29 ] . For cell migration more generally , there have been signiﬁcant modeling eﬀorts , particularly in the case of 2D migration [ 30 – 35 ] . Modeling biochemical reactions along with cellular shape change , however , poses particular challenges due to the so - called “moving boundary problem” [ 36 , 37 ] . Swimming in 3D of Dictyostelium has been modeled by a reaction - diﬀusion system on the mem - brane [ 38 ] . Both 2D crawling and 3D swimming of Dictyostelium occur by protrusions forming at the front of the cell , which bifurcate and translocate toward the rear of the cell [ 39 – 42 ] . These shape changes are time - irreversible in accordance with Purcell’s scallop theorem [ 43 ] , although shape changes are not strictly required for swimming [ 44 , 45 ] . Time - irreversible force dynamics has also been observed for 3D mesenchymal migration [ 46 ] . Meanwhile , links between cell shape and migration have been studied [ 47 ] . The connection between biology and mechanics is known as mechanobiology , which is a growing ﬁeld [ 48 ] . To model cellular shape change and migration , rather than taking a “bottom - up” or mechanistic approach to modeling , where biochemical reactions are posited and force balance equations are written , we opt for a “top - down” or data - driven approach , where experimental data is characterized by measured statistical coeﬃcients . This approach allows for identiﬁcation of important quantities governing the dynamics , which could be compared between diﬀerent biological conditions or used as benchmarks for mechanistic models . In the words of [ 49 ] , such characterization “is important because it deﬁnes the motion that the bottom - up approach attempts to explain” . Data - driven modeling of cell migration has been done mostly in 2D [ 49 – 62 ] . Similar methods have been used to characterize dynamics of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans shape and motion [ 63 – 73 ] and cell migration conﬁned to adhesive micropatterns [ 74 – 78 ] . A review of top - down modeling eﬀorts applied to cell migration is given in [ 79 ] . T cell morphodynamics and migration in 3D collagen matrices have been previously analyzed in [ 80 ] . However , that study contains several major ﬂaws and shortcomings which will be discussed in the main text . This paper presents a reanalysis of the data in [ 80 ] . 2 . Dimensionality reduction of the shape of motile cells First , motile cells were distinguished from sessile cells based on trajectories of the cell centroid . Due to the small number of cells measured , this could be done manually , with the trajectories of motile cells spanning a distance ( the maximum distance between two points on a trajectory ) of at least ≈ 20 µ m . A total of 10 motile cells were detected , all recorded with a frame interval of 4 . 17 s . Next , we analyzed the shapes of the motile cells . Sessile cells are spherical , whereas motile cells assume a polarized shape [ 81 ] . The study [ 80 ] uses descriptors of the cell surface based on spherical harmonics Y ml , and taking for each value of l the squared magnitude summed over m . However , this loses information . The study [ 80 ] partially remedies this by tracking the uropod and recording QUANTIFYING T CELL MORPHODYNAMICS AND MIGRATION IN 3D COLLAGEN MATRICES 3 the distance between the uropod and centroid . We can do better by taking moments of harmonic polynomials relative to the uropod - centroid axis ; we use this axis as a proxy for the polarization axis . We use a convention for Y ml without Condon – Shortley phase , where : ( 1 ) 1 4 π Z dΩ Y ml Y m ′ l ′ ∗ = δ ll ′ δ mm ′ . We deﬁne central moments : ( 2 ) M ml : = Z d A r l Y ml ( θ , φ ) , where r is the distance from the cell centroid to a point on the surface , and normalized moments : ( 3 ) m ml : = M ml A ( l + 2 ) / 2 , where A is the cell surface area . Due to translational symmetry , there are no l = 1 terms . Ro - tational invariance is broken by the choice of polarization axis . The next question is how to scale the quantities with diﬀerent values of l . We consider a small deviation from a spherical surface , represented by r = R ( 1 + ǫ ml Y ml ) for some constant R ( using real spherical harmonics 1 ) . For l ≥ 2 , to order O ( ǫ ml ) , we have : ( 4 ) m ml = l + 2 ( 4 π ) l / 2 ǫ ml . Thus , we deﬁne our shape variables s ml as : ( 5 ) s ml : = ( 4 π ) l / 2 l + 2 m ml , for l ≥ 2 . For l = 0 , we deﬁne s 00 : = log ( A / 4 π ) / 2 so that a change r → ( 1 + ǫ ) r results in a corresponding change s 00 → s 00 + ǫ . In addition , if the uropod - centroid axis is called the z - axis , we deﬁne components of the velocity v 0 : = v z and v 1 : = v x + iv y , as well as orientational changes ∆ θe iφ . Lastly , we use principal component analysis , but before doing so , we subtract the cell - wise mean of the shape parameters . Without doing so , we may obtain a situation where the ﬁrst principal component mainly reﬂects population variability [ 82 ] . We retain moments up to order l = 3 , as this is the minimal possible value of l for which amoeboid swimming by means of shape change is possible [ 83 ] . The l = 2 , m = 0 mode is simply elongation of the cell along its axis ( the z - axis ) . The l = 2 , m = 1 mode describes tilting of the cell and is positive when the cell front ( z > 0 ) deviates in the + x - direction while the cell back ( z < 0 ) deviates in the − x - direction . The l = 2 , m = 2 mode describes lateral elongation of the cell and is positive when the elongation is along the x - axis . The l = 3 , m = 0 mode describes broken symmetry along the polarization axis and is positive when the cell front is narrower than the cell back . Thus the “stereotypical” shape of a polarized cell , which is wide at the front , has s 03 < 0 . The l = 3 , m = 1 mode describes a bent shape , and is positive when the front and back of the cell deviate in the + x - direction while in between it deviates in the − x - direction . The l = 3 , m = 2 mode describes diﬀerential lateral elongation , and positive when the front of the cell is elongated along the x - axis while the back of the cell is elongated along the y - axis . The l = 3 , m = 3 mode describes a triangular deformation 1 For m > 0 , the use of real spherical harmonics leads to a factor of √ 2 in the deﬁnition of ǫ ml relative to complex spherical harmonics . If we refer to the coeﬃcients of real spherical harmonics as ℜ ǫ ml and ℑ ǫ ml , as we do here , then the squared magnitude of the deformation mode is | ǫ ml | 2 rather than 2 | ǫ ml | 2 . 4 QUANTIFYING T CELL MORPHODYNAMICS AND MIGRATION IN 3D COLLAGEN MATRICES Table 1 .

In Table 1 , 95 % conﬁdence intervals calculated using a t - distribution are listed . The only non - zero quantities are invariant under a change of deﬁnition of azimuth φ → φ + ∆ φ , due to symmetry in the description . We see that the variance of the volume variable s 00 is small compared to the principal shape variables , and the variance of s 33 is also small . We also see that , up to this point in the analysis , there is no chirality , which would be manifested as symmetry φ → − φ being broken . Next , we investigate whether dynamics is stationary . We will see later that a description based on overdamped Langevin equations [ 84 ] is not suﬃcient on the measured time - scales , i . e . , an un - derdamped description [ 85 ] is necessary . 2 We use the characterization based on second - order time - symmetric and - antisymmetric quantities [ 87 ] and perform linear regression of these quantities with respect to time . Before statistical analysis , we also scale each cell’s quantities by a suitable factor related to the cell - wise variances of the variables . Using a t - test with Holm – Bonferroni correction , no statistically signiﬁcant deviation from stationarity was detected . 2 Non - Markovianity of cell shapes in 2D for measurements with a 3 s frame interval was suggested in [ 86 ] . How - ever , quantities were linearly interpolated between time - points , which is expected to introduce artifactual non - Markovianity . QUANTIFYING T CELL MORPHODYNAMICS AND MIGRATION IN 3D COLLAGEN MATRICES 5 3 . Linear Gaussian model Here , we ﬁt a linear Gaussian model to the dynamics . In such a model , only quantities with the same ( absolute value of ) m can couple to each other . For m = 0 , the model is : ( 6 )   ¨ s 02 ¨ s 03 ˙ v 0   = A 0 x ∆ s 02 : 3 + A 0 v   ˙ s 02 ˙ s 03 ∆ v 0   + ξ 0 , h ξ 0 ( t ) i = 0 , h ξ 0 ( t ) ξ 0 ( t ′ ) T i = 2 D 0 δ ( t − t ′ ) , where ∆ denotes deviation from the cell - wise mean , and s 02 : 3 : = ( s 02 , s 03 ) T . We used the procedure described in [ 85 ] to infer dynamics ; however , we found it to be necessary to ﬁt a continuous - time model exactly ( see Appendix A ) . We compared the measured and theoretical covariance functions , with good agreement ( Fig . 1 ) . We see that on relatively long time - scales ( & 30 s ) , the shape auto - covariances decay exponentially . We computed a decay rate of 0 . 019 ± 0 . 010 s − 1 ( 95 % conﬁdence interval , t - distribution ) corresponding to a correlation time of 51 s . Next , we used the characteriza - tion based on time - symmetric and - antisymmetric quantities [ 87 ] , and scaled each cell’s quantities by a suitable factor related to the variances , e . g . h ∆ s 02 ∆ s 03 i ( h ( ∆ s 02 ) 2 ih ( ∆ s 03 ) 2 i ) − 1 / 2 . We used a t - test with Holm – Bonferroni correction to evaluate statistical signiﬁcance . 3 We evaluated quantitative sig - niﬁcance of eﬀects using the procedure described in [ 87 ] for the case of almost - Markovian dynamics . For quantities involving ﬂuctuations ( diﬀusivities ) , we do the comparison using the discrete - time estimators described in [ 85 ] ( this is done throughout the paper ) . The quantities with both statisti - cal and quantitative signiﬁcance are h ∆ s 02 ˙ s 03 i < 0 ( adjusted p = 0 . 008 ) and L ( ˙ s 02 , ˙ s 03 ) < 0 ( adjusted p = 1 . 4 × 10 − 4 ) where L ( · , · ) is the angular momentum [ 87 ] . This is in accordance with previous observations of time - irreversibility [ 39 – 42 ] . We now turn to the m = 1 dynamics , described by : ( 7 )   ¨ s 12 ¨ s 13 ( d / d t ) ( ˙ θe iφ ) ˙ v 1   = A 1 x s 12 : 3 + A 1 v   ˙ s 12 ˙ s 13 ˙ θe iφ v 1   + ξ 1 , h ξ 1 ( t ) i = 0 , h ξ 1 ( t ) ξ 1 ( t ′ ) H i = 2 D 1 δ ( t − t ′ ) . Now , we see a diﬀerence in the correlation times of s 12 and s 13 . We calculated decay rates of 0 . 014 ± 0 . 006 s − 1 and 0 . 031 ± 0 . 010 s − 1 , corresponding to correlation times of 85 s and 27 s , again with good agreement between theory and experiment ( Fig . 2 ) . The smaller decay rate was always associated with an eigenvector with larger s 12 component . The statistically and quantitatively signiﬁcant quantities are listed in Table 2 . Again , we see time - irreversibility in the same sense as before . In addition , we have the time - antisymmetric quantities ℜh s 12 ˙ θe − iφ i , ℜh s 12 v 1 ∗ i > 0 . We also have correlated ﬂuctuations ℜ D 13 θ , ℜ D 1 θv > 0 . As with m = 0 , on long time - scales the shape autocovariances decay exponentially . In contrast with m = 0 , we now have the possibility of 3 Due to a population of only 10 cells , we opted for a t - test instead of a bootstrap [ 88 ] . The reason is that if 10 quantities are sampled i . i . d . from a distribution with median 0 , then with probability 2 − 9 , all values will have the same sign . Thus , we cannot estimate p - values below 2 − 9 using the bootstrap . However , the Holm – Bonferroni correction demands estimation of such p - values , as will be seen . As for Gaussianity , while instantaneous quantities may not be normally distributed , we would expect that the time - average approximately obeys a Gaussian distribution . It may be objected that the Gaussian approximation does not hold at low p - values ; however , other procedures might introduce either additional assumptions or greatly increased computational cost . Therefore , we settled on the procedure used here as a reasonable approximation . 6 QUANTIFYING T CELL MORPHODYNAMICS AND MIGRATION IN 3D COLLAGEN MATRICES Figure 1 .

QUANTIFYING T CELL MORPHODYNAMICS AND MIGRATION IN 3D COLLAGEN MATRICES 7 Figure 2 . Covariance functions with m = 1 . Velocities are in units of µ m / fr . Finally , we have the m = 2 dynamics , which is described by : ( 8 ) ¨ s 22 : 3 = A 2 x s 22 : 3 + A 2 v ˙ s 2 2 : 3 + ξ 2 , h ξ 2 ( t ) i = 0 , h ξ 2 ( t ) ξ 2 ( t ′ ) H i = 2 D 2 δ ( t − t ′ ) . We again have a diﬀerence in the correlation times of s 22 and s 23 . We computed decay rates of ( 8 . 8 ± 6 . 0 ) × 10 − 3 s − 1 and 0 . 040 ± 0 . 017 s − 1 , corresponding to correlation times of 99 s and 20 s , again with good agreement between theory and experiment ( Fig . 3 ) . The smaller decay rate was always associated with an eigenvector with larger s 22 component . Visually , there appears to be the possibility of correlations of s 22 to be longer - lived than predicted by theory . However , a statistical test conducted at τ = 209 s gives a non - signiﬁcant result of p = 0 . 024 when multiple hypotheses are taken into account . The statistically and quantitatively signiﬁcant quantities are listed in Table 3 , again with time - irreversibility in the same sense as before , and no chirality detected . As before , for 8 QUANTIFYING T CELL MORPHODYNAMICS AND MIGRATION IN 3D COLLAGEN MATRICES Figure 3 . Covariance functions with m = 2 . Table 3 .

Also , the imaginary part of the m = 2 covariance function was null within statistical error ( not shown ) . We may compare our results to diﬀusion on a sphere . The spherical Laplacian has eigenfunctions Y ml ( θ , φ ) with eigenvalues − l ( l + 1 ) . We observe a diﬀerence in correlation times for l = 2 and l = 3 for m > 0 , but not for m = 0 . 4 . Previous analysis The previous study [ 80 ] claimed oscillatory autocovariance functions ( ACFs ) together with much longer correlation times ( ≥ 150 s ) . However , the power spectra ( Supplementary Figure 5c in [ 80 ] ) do not contain a peak at non - zero frequency . This suggests that the supposed oscillations in the ACFs are statistical noise . Thus , the ﬁtting method which uses the peaks of the measured ACFs grossly overestimates the correlation times . A rough comparison of the power spectra of cells in the “run” mode to a Lorentzian function ( the power spectrum of an Ornstein – Uhlenbeck process ) suggests correlation times of approximately 60 s for all three principal components , in accordance with our results for the m = 0 modes . The results for the cells in the “stop” mode are suspect , as it QUANTIFYING T CELL MORPHODYNAMICS AND MIGRATION IN 3D COLLAGEN MATRICES 9 Figure 4 . Probability distributions obtained from applying t - SNE to real data and simulated data from a linear Gaussian model . is known that ( and has been mentioned earlier that ) sessile cells are spherical [ 81 ] . Indeed , manual inspection of the trajectories of the cell centroid reveals that two out of the four cells classiﬁed as “stop” in [ 80 ] are in fact motile . Next , it was claimed that morphodynamics can be described as inhabiting a set of discrete states . This conclusion was reached by using wavelet analysis along with t - SNE . However , applying the t - SNE algorithm to ﬁnite data can result in artifactual non - uniform probability distributions . To test for this possibility , the analysis procedure was applied to the m = 0 shape variables and compared with the linear Gaussian model from the previous section simulated for 1764 frames ( the same number of frames as in the dataset of motile cells ) , with very similar results ( Fig . 4 ; also compare Supplementary Figure 9a in [ 80 ] ) . Thus , the appearance of multiple peaks in the probability distribution seems to be an artifact of t - SNE . Next , in [ 80 ] it was claimed that the dynamics of the second principal component contain oscilla - tions with period 100 s . However , as was mentioned earlier , there is no peak in the power spectra at non - zero frequency . This suggests a diﬀerent explanation for the observed oscillations . The wavelet transform is obtained by convoluting the time - series with the wavelet , which means that the Fourier transforms of the time - series and the wavelet are multiplied . The maximum power of the ﬁrst and second derivatives of a Gaussian with standard deviation σ occurs at angular frequencies of σ − 1 and √ 2 σ − 1 , respectively . The so - called “width of inﬂuence” of the wavelet is taken to be approximately 6 σ , according to the code provided in [ 80 ] . It was claimed that the entropy 4 is minimized when the ratio of the width of the Mexican hat to the width of the derivative of a Gaussian is 1 . 5 , while the oscillation frequency is located at the maximum of the power spectra of the wavelets . Together , these strongly support the explanation of oscillations as an artifact of the wavelet transform . Lastly , because wavelets have zero integral , the analysis of dynamics in [ 80 ] removes information about location in shape space . In contrast , we analyze dynamics as a function of shape . 4 Not to be confused with physical entropy production , which is related to the probability ratio between forward and backward trajectories [ 89 ] . 10 QUANTIFYING T CELL MORPHODYNAMICS AND MIGRATION IN 3D COLLAGEN MATRICES 5 . Non - Gaussian effects Following [ 87 ] , we characterize the third - order dynamics by the quantities h x i x j x k i , h x i x j ˙ x k i where : ( 9 ) h x i x j ˙ x k i + h x i ˙ x j x k i + h ˙ x i x j x k i = 0 , h x i ˙ x j ˙ x k i , ( 10 ) e L ( x i , ˙ x j , ˙ x k ) : = 1 2 (cid:2) L ( x i ˙ x j , ˙ x k ) − L ( x i ˙ x k , ˙ x j ) (cid:3) , h ˙ x i ˙ x j ˙ x k i , and L ( ˙ x i ˙ x j , ˙ x k ) , where : ( 11 ) L ( ˙ x i ˙ x j , ˙ x k ) + L ( ˙ x j ˙ x k , ˙ x i ) + L ( ˙ x k ˙ x i , ˙ x j ) = 0 . 5 In the case of almost - Markovian dynamics , the ﬁrst four sets of quantities form one group , while the last two sets of quantities form another group [ 87 ] . For our system , in the ﬁrst group , there are 389 independent quantities , of which 75 are purely real and 12 are purely imaginary . In the second group , there are 338 independent quantities , of which 72 are purely real and none are purely imagi - nary . We apply Holm – Bonferroni correction independently to each group and evaluate quantitative signiﬁcance according to [ 87 ] . As before , prior to statistical testing , we divide quantities for each cell by a factor related to the variances ( e . g . h ∆ s 0 i ∆ s 0 j ∆ s 0 k i ( h ( ∆ s 0 i ) 2 ih ( ∆ s 0 j ) 2 ih ( ∆ s 0 k ) 2 i ) − 1 / 2 ) . As with the second - order quantities , we tested these for trends but found nothing statistically signiﬁcant . We estimate the contribution of measurement error using the procedure described in [ 85 , 87 ] ( see Appendix B ) . From the linear Gaussian model , it appears that for the time - step used here , the measurement error is overestimated . Besides , estimated measurement error for individual cells may not be reliable . Thus , we take an informal approach and compare the population - averaged estimate of the contribution of measurement error to the population - averaged estimate of the quantity in question . The statistically and quantitatively signiﬁcant non - Gaussian eﬀects are tabulated in Table 4 . No chirality was detected . First , we note that the existence of non - Gaussian eﬀects depends on the choice of coordinate . This is particularly relevant in our situation , where although we deﬁned our shape variables based on linearization about a spherical shape , in the regime of actual shapes obtained the mapping from the deformation coeﬃcients deﬁning the distance function r ( θ , φ ) to our shape variables is highly nonlinear ( see Appendix C ) . We have attempted to roughly estimate the contribution of this nonlinearity to the non - Gaussian coeﬃcients , assuming linear Gaussian dynam - ics for the deformation coeﬃcients , orientational dynamics , and center - of - mass motion . These are listed in the “Est . ” columns in Table 4 , expressed as a fraction of the measured value . We see that for most quantities involving shape alone , there is a signiﬁcant possibility of non - Gaussian eﬀects being explained by the nonlinear shape mapping . However , for the quantities involving orienta - tional dynamics or center - of - mass motion , the estimated contribution is small and thus we think it is likely not due to the nonlinearity of shape coordinates . Thus , we focus our attention on these quantities . First , we have ℜh ∆ s 02 ˙ s 12 ˙ θe − iφ i , ℜh ∆ s 02 d [ ˙ s 12 , ˙ θe − iφ ] / d t i < 0 . This expresses a negative correlation between elongation and joint ﬂuctuations of ˙ s 12 and ˙ θe iφ . This makes sense as a more elongated shape will be less aﬀected by ﬂuctuations of direction at the front . Next , we have quantities of the opposite 5 It is shown in [ 85 ] how to extract terms in the Langevin equation from trajectories . However , the time - step is too large relative to dynamics to justify a discrete - time approach , and it would be extremely troublesome to relate discrete - time measurements to continuous - time parameters .

These also make sense as a non - straight cell will change direction more if it elongates faster . It is notable that in the case of a martingale in Markovian dynamics , opposite signs are required for vanishing of the third - order angular momentum [ 87 ] . This can be intuitively understood as follows . Suppose we start with a low s 02 with s 12 = 0 ; we then have strongly correlated ﬂuctuations of ˙ s 12 and ˙ θe iφ . Now , we have a value of s 1 2 positively correlated with the ﬂuctuation of ˙ θe iφ . If ˙ θe iφ were to continue in the same direction , this would imply an increase in s 02 , meaning an eﬀect in the opposite direction as the low s 02 we started with . However , it is possible that there are angular momenta which are actually quantitatively signiﬁcant but that we do not have the necessary statistics to resolve them . Next , we have ℜh ∆ s 03 ˙ s 12 ˙ θe − iφ i < 0 . Recalling that a widening of the front is a more negative s 03 , this corresponds to a positive correlation between a wider front and joint ﬂuctuations of ˙ s 12 and ˙ θe iφ . Next , we have another pair of sets of quantities with opposite sign : ℜh s 22 ∗ ˙ s 12 v 1 i , ℜh s 23 ∗ ˙ s 12 ˙ θe iφ i , ℜh s 23 ∗ ˙ s 12 v 1 i > 0 , whereas ℜh s 12 ˙ θe iφ ˙ s 22 ∗ i , ℜh s 12 ˙ θe iφ ˙ s 23 ∗ i , ℜh s 12 v 1 ˙ s 22 ∗ i , ℜh s 13 ˙ θe iφ ˙ s 23 ∗ i , ℜh s 12 d [ ˙ θe iφ , ˙ s 22 ∗ ] / d t i < 0 . The ﬁrst 12 QUANTIFYING T CELL MORPHODYNAMICS AND MIGRATION IN 3D COLLAGEN MATRICES set of quantities says that joint ﬂuctuations of shape and direction tend to occur along lateral elon - gation of the front of the cell . The second set of quantities is somewhat less intuitive , but can be understood as follows . If an m = 1 cell deformation mode and the cell’s direction of motion or change in orientation are aligned , then the front widens laterally perpendicular to the deformation mode . If they are anti - aligned , then the front widens laterally parallel to the deformation mode . Again , as in the previous case , the quantities of opposite signs make opposite contributions to the third - order angular momentum . Lastly , we have the two quantities from the second group of the partition mentioned at the beginning of this section . The ﬁrst quantity , ℜh ( ˙ θe iφ ) 2 ˙ s 22 ∗ i < 0 , is time - antisymmetric and can be interpreted as a negative correlation between ˙ s 22 and orientational changes . The second quantity , ℜ L ( v 1 ˙ s 22 ∗ , ˙ s 13 ) > 0 , is time - symmetric and can be interpreted as a positive correlation between the acceleration ¨ s 13 and v 1 ˙ s 22 ∗ , which is admittedly diﬃcult to intuit . Ideally , the next step would be to investigate the third - order covariance functions and evaluate if they are consistent with a description based on an underdamped Langevin equation . However , given that there are hundreds of coeﬃcients , such an evaluation would be diﬃcult mathematically as well as visually with a sample size as small as ours . Already with equal - time quantities , we are having diﬃculties with the small p - values required . Nevertheless , we have included some third - order covariance functions for illustration ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) . 6 . Conclusions We have elucidated the “laws of motion” obeyed by T cell morphodynamics and migration in 3D collagen matrices . We have corrected previous understanding which incorrectly posited discrete structure of the probability distribution of dynamics and periodic oscillations of shape . We have in - troduced a new method of 3D shape description relative to the polarization axis , preserving diﬀerent possible modes of shape variation , and have described dynamics using an underdamped Langevin equation . This approach reveals diﬀerent correlation times for diﬀerent modes : the m = 0 modes have correlation times approximately 60 s , the ( l , m ) = ( 2 , 1 ) and ( l , m ) = ( 2 , 2 ) modes approxi - mately 90 s , and the ( l , m ) = ( 3 , 1 ) and ( l , m ) = ( 3 , 2 ) modes approximately 30 s . In addition , we have quantiﬁed time - irreversibility , which has been qualitatively observed in previous studies . Fur - thermore , we have extracted novel coeﬃcients describing non - Gaussianity and have found patterns in the signs of the coeﬃcients . Also , we did not ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant correlations between phase - space velocities and quadratic polynomials of shape . However , our analysis is limited by small sample size . Still , we have been able to determine the presence of some non - Gaussian eﬀects by taking into account possible population heterogeneity when calculating statistics . While mechanistic insights likely cannot be gleaned at this stage , we have characterized biology at the level of emergent behavior , which is an important step in understanding a complex system such as cell migration . Future work could involve analyzing larger datasets and comparing diﬀerent biological conditions . In particular , multiple biological replicates would be desired to conﬁrm the ﬁndings . Additionally , temporal and population variability could be quantiﬁed . In this work , we only considered temporally - and population - averaged dynamics . The role of temporal and population variability in cell migration has been considered in [ 60 , 62 , 90 , 91 ] . Augmenting our analysis to include these aspects would form the basis for a data - driven understanding of 3D cell migration , an area where there is currently limited research .

( 35 ) 8 . Appendix B In this appendix , we calculate the contribution of measurement error to the estimation of L ( ˙ x i ˙ x j , ˙ x k ) . Let y : = x + η denote the measured values , with η the measurement error . We only consider second moments of η , denoted by Λ , and may be state - dependent . Following [ 85 ] , we make the assumption Λ ≪ h ˙ x ˙ x T i ( ∆ t ) 2 , where ∆ t is the time - step , necessary for validity of the esti - mation procedure . We have veriﬁed that this is the case for our dataset . We deﬁne e Λ : = Λ ( ∆ t ) − 2 so that e Λ = O ( ( ∆ t ) 0 ) . The estimate is given by : ( 36 ) L ( ˙ x i ˙ x j , ˙ x k ) ≈ ( ∆ t ) − 4 h ( y i ( t + ∆ t ) − y i ( t ) ) ( y j ( t + ∆ t ) − y j ( t ) ) ( y k ( t + 2∆ t ) − y k ( t + ∆ t ) ) − ( y i ( t + 2∆ t ) − y i ( t + ∆ t ) ) ( y j ( t + 2∆ t ) − y j ( t + ∆ t ) ) ( y k ( t + ∆ t ) − y k ( t ) ) i . The contribution of measurement error is seen to be : ( 37 ) ( ∆ t ) − 2 h ( e Λ ij ( t + ∆ t ) + e Λ ij ( t ) ) ( x k ( t + 2∆ t ) − x k ( t + ∆ t ) ) − ( e Λ ij ( t + 2∆ t ) + e Λ ij ( t + ∆ t ) ) ( x k ( t + ∆ t ) − x k ( t ) ) − e Λ ik ( t + ∆ t ) ( x j ( t + ∆ t ) − x j ( t ) ) − e Λ jk ( t + ∆ t ) ( x i ( t + ∆ t ) − x i ( t ) ) + e Λ ik ( t + ∆ t ) ( x j ( t + 2∆ t ) − x j ( t + ∆ t ) ) + e Λ jk ( t + ∆ t ) ( x i ( t + 2∆ t ) − x i ( t + ∆ t ) ) i . Now , we have : ( 38 ) ( ∆ t ) − 2 h e Λ ij ( t + ∆ t ) ( x k ( t + 2∆ t ) − 2 x k ( t + ∆ t ) + x k ( t ) ) i = h e Λ ij ◦ ¨ x k i + O ( ∆ t ) , where ◦ denotes Stratonovich convention . The last two lines of Eq . ( 37 ) therefore contribute : ( 39 ) h e Λ ik ◦ ¨ x j i + h e Λ jk ◦ ¨ x i i + O ( ∆ t ) . 18 QUANTIFYING T CELL MORPHODYNAMICS AND MIGRATION IN 3D COLLAGEN MATRICES Table 5 .

The second line of Eq . ( 40 ) evaluates to h e Λ ij ◦ ¨ x k i + O ( ∆ t ) . The ﬁrst line of Eq . ( 40 ) can be evaluated by using an Itˆo – Taylor expansion [ 85 ] , resulting in : ( 41 ) ( ∆ t ) − 2 h ( e Λ ij ( t ) + e Λ ij ( t + 2∆ t ) ) ( x k ( t + 2∆ t ) − 2 x k ( t + ∆ t ) + x k ( t ) ) i = 2 h e Λ ij ◦ ¨ x k i + O ( ∆ t ) . The ﬁnal result is therefore : ( 42 ) h 4 e Λ ij ◦ ¨ x k + e Λ ik ◦ ¨ x j + e Λ jk ◦ ¨ x i i + O ( ∆ t ) . Finally , we need to estimate h e Λ ij ◦ ¨ x k i from time - lapse data . However , we cannot do this by using the estimator for Λ described in [ 85 , 87 ] together with the direct estimator for ¨ x k , because this will introduce terms involving Λ ik and Λ jk . Instead , we need to infer h ◦ ¨ x | x , ˙ x i and plug in the obtained function of x and ˙ x . 9 . Appendix C In this appendix , we describe the estimation of contributions of the shape mapping to non - Gaussian eﬀects . We consider a distance function : ( 43 ) r ( θ , φ ) = 1 + 3 X l = 2 l X m = − l r ml Y ml ( θ , φ ) ( in actuality , we use real spherical harmonics ) and investigate the map r ml 7→ s ml . First , we attempted to solve for each s ml the corresponding r ml . However , in many cases the obtained solutions had large negative values of r ( θ , φ ) and were thus unreliable . Therefore , we took another approach . We then tried to estimate the distribution of r ml by generating for each cell a Gaussian distribution with the same mean and variance as s ml , and setting the r ml values to these multiplied by some factor γ m l and for m = 0 adding an oﬀset δ l , to be determined by equating the resulting mean and variance of the corresponding s ml for m = 0 and the resulting variance for m > 0 . The calculated factors γ ml and oﬀsets δ l are tabulated in Table 5 . The resulting r ( θ , φ ) often had negative minimum values , but these were generally small compared to the maximum values ( Fig . 7 ) , especially when raised to a power ( after taking centroid oﬀset into account ) and when combined with the fact that larger r values take up more surface area , so we deemed this to be acceptable . The statistics for the calculated s ml for the entire population are Var ( s 02 ) = 0 . 014 , Var ( s 03 ) = 4 . 6 × 10 − 3 ( ﬁtted ) , and Cov ( s 02 , s 03 ) = − 2 . 7 × 10 − 3 , compared to a true value of − 4 . 0 × 10 − 3 . The cell - wise statistics are Var ( s 02 ) = 4 . 5 × 10 − 3 , Var ( s 03 ) = 3 . 3 × 10 − 3 , Cov ( s 02 , s 03 ) = − 0 . 5 × 10 − 3 , ℜh s 12 s 13 ∗ i = 0 . 6 × 10 − 3 , and ℜh s 22 s 23 ∗ i = 2 . 7 × 10 − 3 ( compare with Table 1 ) .

Next , we ﬁt the obtained s ml to quadratic polynomials in r ml . Along with azimuthal and chiral symmetry , the shape map obeys the symmetry of ﬂipping the z - axis . In addition , a spherical shape must have s ml = 0 .

Despite high R 2 values ( & 0 . 9 ) , the ﬁtted coeﬃcients changed when the distribution of r ml was modiﬁed ( not shown ) , indicating a lack of predictive power and nonlinearity beyond quadratic . 20 QUANTIFYING T CELL MORPHODYNAMICS AND MIGRATION IN 3D COLLAGEN MATRICES Table 6 .

However , this was infeasible and thus we are not able to make a serious estimate . Furthermore , statistics for individual cells were not well reproduced ( Fig . 8 ) . Thus , as an approximation , we resorted to using the dynamics of s ml multiplied by γ ml and for m = 0 adding δ l . We ran simulations of this dynamics for r ml and calculated the corresponding s ml . The simulated covariance matrices are listed in Eqs . ( 51 ) – ( 53 ) ( compare to Appendix A ; however , values here are calculated using discrete time ) ; they are roughly similar to the true values ( this is also true for the angular momenta L ( v i , v j ) and diﬀusivities , not shown ) , which indicates that we have a reasonable approximation . We then used the quadratic ﬁt ( Eqs . ( 44 ) – ( 50 ) ) to calculate theoretically the terms in the third - order quantities up to quadratic order in β ( i . e . , combining α and β into a single linear coeﬃcient when writing in terms of demeaned variables ) under assumption of a linear Gaussian process for r ml , orientational changes , and veloc - ity . We also ignore population heterogeneity . The advantage of the theoretical approach is that it decomposes the value into a sum of terms , thus allowing sensitivity to parameters to be more easily examined . In no case did a small quantity result from the subtraction of large quantities . On the other hand , simulation allows the full nonlinearity to be accounted for . Results from simulations were in line with theoretical estimates . This procedure gives a rough order - of - magnitude estimate for the contribution of nonlinear shape mapping to measured quantities .
