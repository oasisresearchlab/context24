Systematic Review and Meta - Analysis 1 Medicine ® Risk factors of infection among close contacts of COVID - 19 A systematic review and meta - analysis Chun Gao , MD a , b , Jing - Jing Jiang , MD a , b , Jun - Feng Mao , MD c , Xiao - Hui Yu , MD , PhD a , Xiao - Feng Zheng , MD d , Jiu - Cong Zhang , MD , PhD a , * Abstract Background : Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) was first detected in December 2019 , and declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) on March 11 , 2020 . The current management of COVID - 19 is based generally on supportive therapy and treatment to prevent respiratory failure . Methods : PubMed , Web of Science , Embase , CNKI , and other databases were searched by computer , and relevant literature published from December 2019 to November 2022 on the influencing factors of infection in close contacts with novel coronavirus pneumonia was collected . Meta - analysis was carried out after literature screening , quality assessment , and data extraction . Results : A total of 425 articles were retrieved and 11 were included . Meta - analysis showed that there were 6 risk factors , and the combined OR value and 95 % CI of each influencing factor were 5 . 23 ( 3 . 20 , 8 . 57 ) for family members , 1 . 63 ( 0 . 56 , 4 . 77 ) for regular contact , 2 . 14 ( 0 . 62 , 7 . 32 ) for the elderly , 0 . 58 ( 0 . 001569 . 89 ) for cohabitation , 1 . 97 ( 1 . 02 , 3 . 82 ) for women and 0 . 75 ( 0 . 01 , 54 . 07 ) for others . The Deeks’ funnel diagram indicates that there is no potential publication bias among the included studies . Conclusion : Family members and gender differences are the risk factors of infection among close contacts , and it cannot be proved that there are differences in infection among frequent contact , advanced age , and living together .

Introduction Coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) in 2019 is a highly infectious disease caused by novel coronavirus and severe acute respi - ratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) . [ 1 , 2 ] The World Health Organization ( WHO ) announced that COVID - 19 reached a pandemic status on January 30 , 2020 , [ 3 , 4 ] and then declared a global pandemic in March 2020 . [ 5 ] As of November 17 , 2022 , more than 635 million confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 cases have been reported globally , and more than 6 . 60 mil - lion COVID - 19 - related deaths have been reported . [ 6 ] The case fatality rate varies from country to country and is estimated to be above 0 % to 20 % . [ 7 ] COVID - 19 virus has the charac - teristics of rapid transmission , strong concealment of the source of infection , and is easy to cause large - scale transmis - sion . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defined close contacts in the SARS - CoV - 2 environment as those who accumulated within 6 feet of SARS - CoV - 2 infected persons for 15 minutes or more within 24 hours . [ 8 ] The close contacts of COVID - 19 are the susceptible population of COVID - 19 , and its infection recurrence rate may cause a cluster epidemic , thus affecting the trend of the epidemic . Close contact tracing is an intervention and a major public health response to the import of rare or emerging infectious diseases . At the same time , index cases are required to provide as much information as possi - ble about contacts who have acquired infection risk within a given period of time before the test results are available . [ 9 ] The main objectives of contact tracing are to identify potentially infected individuals before the onset of severe symptoms , and to prevent onward transmission from the secondary cases . Contact tracing has decisively contributed to the control of The present study has been supported by Intra - hospital COVID - 19 Fund of The 940 Hospital of Joint Logisitic Support Forces of PLA ( no . 20yjky020 ) and General Project of Huoshenshan Hospital Scientific Research Fund ( no .

[ 10 – 13 ] Report of the WHO - China Joint Mission on COVID - 19 pointed out that China has a policy of meticulous case and contact identification for COVID - 19 . [ 14 ] Previous studies using mathematical model - ing also theoretically demonstrated that contact tracing and quarantine play important roles in controlling the spreading of COVID - 19 . [ 15 , 16 ] In addition to this , contact tracing also pro - vides a unique opportunity to investigate the epidemiological features of COVID - 19 . To better control the epidemic situation , the most effective way to prevent disease transmission is to take effective pre - vention and control measures , screen as many symptomatic and asymptomatic infected people as possible and track their contacts . [ 17 ] Only by identifying the potential infected persons among the contacts in a short period of time can we effec - tively block the spread of the epidemic and reduce the adverse impact of the epidemic . Many scholars at home and abroad have provided important insights into the factors affecting the transmission of primary cases of COVID - 19 and the suscep - tibility of close contacts , but the risk factors included in each study are not consistent and the results are different . The col - lection of accurate epidemiological data through contact trac - ing can improve the awareness of the epidemic situation and formulate effective intervention measures . In the current study , we employed a large dataset including 41 , 391 close contacts of COVID - 19 cases to estimate the attack rates , and identify risk factors for infection of COVID - 19 . Under the context of worldwide pandemic , understanding this issue can identify high - risk groups and provide evidence to develop targeted prevention . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Literature inclusion and exclusion criteria 2 . 1 . 1 . Inclusion criteria . The journal literature that describes the influencing factors of COVID - 19 infection in the connectives published at home and abroad on December 2022 - 03 , 2019 , is limited to English ; The subjects of the study were persons who had not taken effective protection from close contact with suspected cases and confirmed cases , regardless of gender , age , population and region , from 2 days before the symptom of the case or from 2 days before the sample of asymptomatic infected persons was taken ; The statistical method is correct , with clear odds ratio ( OR ) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) of each risk factor , and clear and accurate statistical data . Outcome indicators : A family members ; B Frequent contact ; C Old age ; D Female ; E cohabitation ; F Others , etc . 2 . 1 . 2 . Exclusion criteria . The exclusion criteria of literature were : Repeated publication of literature ; Systematic evaluation review or Meta - analysis ; Literature review ; Unable to extract useful data or obtain full text ; Literature with quality score < 7 ; There are no relevant outcome indicators or incomplete reports in the literature ; and Non - english literature . 2 . 2 . Search strategy By using a combination of subject words and free words , we searched PubMed , Web of Science , Embase , CNKI , and searched the relevant literature published during the period from December 2019 to November 2022 on the influencing factors of COVID - 19 infection among Chinese close contacts .

Literature screening and data extraction Two physicians will independently screen the retrieved literature . If there is any difference , the third physician will decide or solve it through collective discussion . The two doctors screened the lit - erature and extracted the data according to the preset inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria . After carefully reading the title and abstract of the literature , they eliminated the literature that obvi - ously did not meet the inclusion criteria . Then they screened the literature that might meet the inclusion criteria by reading the full text , determined the final selected literature , and finally extracted the relevant data . For those literature with incomplete data , they sent the email contact the author by phone for help . The specific contents of data extraction include : general data : author , title , year of publication and number of cases in each group ; outcome indicators : A family members ; B Frequent contact ; C Old age ; D Female ; E cohabitation ; F Others , etc . 2 . 4 . Literature quality evaluation Meta - analysis is to collect and sort out the original research data and conduct the second processing . The quality of the original research data and the evaluation methods of the included litera - ture will affect the accuracy of the meta - analysis results , and even mislead the clinical practice . This meta - analysis uses the NOS eval - uation scale [ 18 ] to evaluate the quality of the literature that has read the full text . There are 8 items in total , and the full score is 9 , spe - cifically including : population selection , comparability , exposure or result evaluation . In case of any discrepancy in data extraction and quality evaluation , the third researcher shall decide ( Fig . 2 ) . 2 . 5 . Statistical analysis RevMan5 . 4 software provided by Cochrane collaboration network was used to conduct meta - analysis on the included research data . All effects were expressed by 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . Heterogeneity exists due to the variation among different studies , and I 2 is used to quantitatively determine the size of heterogeneity . If I 2 < 50 % , the fixed effect model is used for meta - analysis ; If I 2 > 50 % , the random effect model is used for meta - analysis , and the difference is statistically significant with P ≤ . 05 . Sensitivity analysis was carried out by eliminat - ing individual studies one by one and observing the difference between the combined efficacy of the remaining studies and the total efficacy of all studies . The publication bias was analyzed by Deeks’ funnel chart . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Literature search results Figure 1 The number of articles during several steps based on the PRISMA flow diagram . A total of 425 articles were identified through a prelimi - nary search of the database , of which 311 articles were initially included after deduplication . 232 articles were then selected after relevancy check by their title and abstract , and then 168 articles were left after eligibility check by reading the full text . Finally 11 articles were included for data extraction and meta - analysis . There was a total of 41391 patients in the literature ( Fig . 1 ) . 3 . 2 . Basic information of the included studies Tables 1 and 2 are the basic information of all the included articles . 3 . 3 . Bias risk assessment The included literature is a retrospective study , lacking prospec - tive research . Although the retrospective study lacks well - de - signed randomized methods , the data of each research group is complete , comparable in family members , gender , age and other aspects , and the data analysis is reasonable . In addition , the included literature is scored by the NOS scale . 3 . 4 . Meta - analysis results This meta - analysis included 7 factors that affect the infection of COVID - 19 adherents in China . The combined OR value of each factor was greater than 0 , and 95 % CI did not contain 1 , suggesting that they were all risk factors ; The order of influence on the infection of close contacts from strong to weak is : fam - ily members , elderly , women , regular contact , cohabitation , and other reasons . Meta - analysis forest diagram of each factor is shown in Figures 2 – 7 . Among the 11 articles included , 10 were in line with the inclusion criteria for family members , with a total of 36 , 511 patients . There was a large heterogeneity among the stud - ies ( P < . 01 , I 2 = 94 % > 50 % ) . The sensitivity analysis method was used to exclude and analyze the indicators of the groups included in the study , and the final results did not change much . So we used the random effect model to deal with it , and the results showed that the risk factors of family members as COVID - 19 recipients were statistically significant ( OR = 5 . 23 , 95 % CI [ 3 . 20 , 8 . 57 ] , P < . 01 ) . See Figure 2 for the results of meta - analysis . Figure 2 . Forest plot of risk factors for family members .

There was a large heterogeneity among the studies ( P < . 01 , I 2 = 72 % > 50 % ) . The sensitivity analysis method was used to exclude and ana - lyze the indicators of the groups included in the study , and the final results did not change much . So we used the random effect model to deal with it , and the results showed that there was no statistically significant risk factor for frequent exposure as a COVID - 19 contact ( OR = 1 . 63 , 95 % CI [ 0 . 56 , 4 . 77 ] , P = . 37 ) . See Figure 3 for the meta - analysis results . Among the 11 articles included , 5 articles met the inclu - sion criteria of advanced age , with a total of 19 , 769 patients . There was a large heterogeneity among the studies ( P < . 01 , I 2 = 99 % > 50 % ) .

See Figure 4 for the meta - anal - ysis results . Among the 11 articles included , 2 articles met the inclusion criteria of gender differences , with total of 11 , 792 patients . There was a large heterogeneity among the studies ( P < . 01 , I 2 = 38 % < 50 % ) . The sensitivity analysis method was used to exclude and analyze the indicators of the groups included in the study , and the final results did not change much . Therefore , we used the fixed effect model to deal with it , and the results showed that the risk factors of the elderly as the COVID - 19 connectives were statistically significant ( OR = 1 . 69 , 95 % CI [ 1 . 41 , 2 . 01 ] , P < . 01 ) . See Figure 5 for the meta - analysis results . Among the 11 articles included , 2 articles met the inclu - sion criteria of living together , with a total of 6404 patients . There was a large heterogeneity among the studies ( P < . 01 , I 2 = 97 % > 50 % ) . The sensitivity analysis method was used to exclude and analyze the indicators of the groups included in the study , and the final results did not change much . So we used the random effect model to deal with it , and the results showed that there was no statistical significance for the risk fac - tors of the elderly as COVID - 19 recipients ( OR = 0 . 58 , 95 % CI [ 0 . 001569 . 89 ] , P = . 89 ) . See Figure 6 for the meta analysis results . Among the 11 articles included , 2 articles met the inclu - sion criteria of other contact , with a total of 4696 patients .

Publication bias The Deeks’ funnel chart was used for publication bias test , which showed that the scatter points in the funnel chart frequently con - tacted by factors were basically symmetrical , and the scatter points were within the confidence limit , suggesting that there was no potential publication bias among the included studies ( Figs . 8 – 13 ) . 4 . Discussion In this study , 11 articles were collected from December 2019 to March 2022 on the analysis of influencing factors of COVID - 19 infection in Chinese contactors . The results of quality evaluation showed that there were 3 articles with 7 points , 5 articles with 8 points , and 3 articles with 9 points . The included literature data were authentic and reliable . The 5 influencing factors were heterogeneous in the literature , so the random effect model was used for meta combination ; There is no heterogeneity in one influencing factor included in the literature . The fixed effect model was selected for meta combination , and the correlation strength between each risk factor and the infection of the close contacts was comprehensively summarized . The study found that family members ranked the first among all influencing factors . The risk of infection of the contact per - son is closely related to its relationship with the indicated case . Compared with non relatives , family members’ relationship sig - nificantly increased the risk of infection ( OR = 5 . 23 ) . COVID - 19 virus is mainly transmitted through droplets and contact . Frequent contact ( OR = 1 . 63 ) and living together ( OR = 0 . 58 ) between family members in a closed environment in the same Figure 8 . The Deeks’ funnel plot curve of family members . OR = odds ratio . Figure 9 . The Deeks’ funnel plot curve of close contact . OR = odds ratio . 7 Gao et al . • Medicine ( 2023 ) 102 : 29 www . md - journal . com room lead to the status of high infection among family members , forming the transmission characteristics of family gathering . This result suggests that the closer the relationship between close con - tacts and patients , the greater the chance of infection . During the COVID - 19 pandemic , the impact of community environment is huge , which proves that early and strict isolation and tracking is an effective strategy to limit clusters . [ 30 , 31 ] Close contact trac - ing mainly includes identification , listing , and tracking , and is an important aspect of epidemic control and often needs the help of all sectors of society . [ 32 ] Besides , it is also a tedious task that requires a lot of human resources and cannot be fully imple - ment in areas with widespread transmission . [ 33 – 35 ] How to accu - rately identify and track management is still a difficult problem . Therefore , in daily life , we should strengthen the disinfection of the family environment and develop good living habits to reduce the spread among family members . At the same time , it has proved that it is very necessary to take the centralized isolation medical observation of secret contacts as the prevention and control plan of COVID - 19 . In the early stage , the centralized isolation of single person and single room for secret contacts can be implemented as soon as possible , which can effectively increase the social distance and help to block the spread of COVID - 19 , especially to control the spread of COVID - 19 in the home . The analysis results show that the elderly ( OR = 2 . 14 ) will also increase the risk of infection , which is related to the under - lying diseases of the elderly or low immunity . There have been many outbreaks in nursing homes and other long - term care institutions at home and abroad , [ 36 ] and other relevant studies [ 37 ] Figure 10 . The Deeks’ funnel plot curve of advanced age . OR = odds ratio . Figure 11 . The Deeks’ funnel plot curve of female . OR = odds ratio . 8 Gao et al . • Medicine ( 2023 ) 102 : 29 Medicine show that the incidence and mortality of COVID - 19 in the elderly are significantly higher than other age groups . Therefore , during the COVID - 19 , more targeted preventive measures should be implemented to protect the elderly from infection , so as to reduce the severity and mortality , thus producing the great - est social benefits . However , the stability of this meta - analysis is poor , so further research is needed to obtain more evidence to clarify the differences in infection between ages . The study found that the risk of infection of female contacts was twice as high as that of male contacts ( OR = 1 . 97 ) , which may be because they are more likely to have close contact in daily contact . Clinical data on COVID - 19 show that there is no signif - icant gender difference in susceptibility to COVID - 19 infection . Some studies believe that the infection rate of men is higher than that of women . This difference may be due to the higher levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in men and the influence of hormones on immune response . Gender differences in behavior may also lead to more severe and fatal COVID - 19 observed in men . [ 38 ] However , Krueger [ 39 ] and Stokes [ 40 ] found that the number of female cases was significantly higher than that of male cases . They believed that the difference in the expression of ACE2 caused by sex hor - mones might help explain the gender differences in COVID - 19 infection , severity and mortality . This is consistent with the results of this study . Understanding of these sex and gender differences is necessary , as it can help identify vulnerable populations and develop specific and effective therapeutic strategies . To sum up , family members and women are risk factors that affect the infection of informants . Effective identification of high - risk Figure 12 . The Deeks’ funnel plot curve of living together .

This study has several strengths . First , our study includes the largest number of close contacts of Emerging Microbes & Infections COVID - 19 to date . Second , our study is a retrospec - tive cohort study , which provides information with explicit tem - porality for causal inference , and the recall bias was reduced . Third , we estimated the attack rates and infected risks for differ - ent contacts , which is helpful for identifying susceptible groups to develop specific protection . Fourth , we estimated the conta - giousness across the course of COVID - 19 . Some limitations also need to be noted . First , although we used a large dataset with more than 10 , 000 of contacts , the sample size of cases was limited in some subgroups , which may lead to insufficient power to identify the statistical significance . Second , a number of asymptomatic infections may be missed and their close contacts cannot be identified . Third , since the imperfect sen - sitivity of the RT - PCR test , some potential infections among close contacts may be missed . Fourth , the data were collected by a vari - ety of epidemiological investigation groups across Guang - dong Province . Despite using the same protocol , the implementation may have inconsistence and some noise may be introduced . Author contributions Conceptualization : Xiao - Hui Yu .
