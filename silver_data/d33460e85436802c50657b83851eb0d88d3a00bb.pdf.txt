Three sampling strategies were used to 26 understand the presence of virus in the air in different environmental conditions . In the first 27 strategy , which involved hospital settings , air samples were collected from several areas of 28 hospitals like COVID - intensive - care units ( ICUs ) , nurse - stations , COVID - wards , corridors , 29 non - COVID - wards , personal protective equipment ( PPE ) doffing areas , COVID rooms , out - 30 patient ( OP ) corridors , mortuary , COVID casualty areas , non - COVID ICUs and doctors’ 31 rooms . Out of the 80 air samples collected from 6 hospitals from two Indian cities - 32 Hyderabad and Mohali , 30 samples showed the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acids . In 33 the second sampling strategy , that involved indoor settings , one or more COVID - 19 patients 34 were asked to spend a short duration of time in a closed room . Out of 17 samples , 5 samples , 35 including 4 samples collected after the departure of three symptomatic patients from the 36 room , showed the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acids . In the third strategy , involving 37 indoor settings , air samples were collected from rooms of houses of home - quarantined 38 COVID - 19 patients and it was observed that SARS - CoV - 2 RNA could be detected in the air 39 in the rooms occupied by COVID - 19 patients but not in the other rooms of the houses . Taken 40 together , we observed that the air around COVID - 19 patients frequently showed the presence 41 of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in both hospital and indoor residential settings and the positivity rate 42 was higher when 2 or more COVID - 19 patients occupied the room . In hospitals , SARS - CoV - 43 2 RNA could be detected in ICUs as well as in non - ICUs , suggesting that the viral shedding 44 happened irrespective of the severity of the infection . This study also provides evidence for 45 the viability of SARS - CoV - 2 and its long - range transport through the air . Thus , airborne 46 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 transmission could be a major mode of transmission for SARS - CoV - 2 and appropriate 47 precautions need to be followed to prevent the spread of infection through the air . 48 Key words : COVID - 19 , SARS - CoV - 2 , airborne transmission , coronavirus , hospital air , 49 closed - room air , SARS - CoV - 2 infection 50 Funding statement : This research activity in general was supported by Council of Scientific 51 and Industrial Research ( CSIR ) . No specific project grant was acquired for this activity . 52 Ethical Approval : The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of CSIR - 53 Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology ( IEC - 83 / 2020 ) . Informed consent from subjects 54 was taken wherever required . 55 56 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 1 . Introduction : 57 The ~ 100nm viral particle , SARS - CoV - 2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 58 has affected different aspects of human life in multiple ways ( Bar - On , Flamholz et al . 2020 ) . 59 The effects on the patient are not only restricted to the dysfunction of the respiratory system 60 but are seen to range from the patient being totally asymptomatic to respiratory or multiorgan 61 failure in several cases ( Baj , Karakuła - Juchnowicz et al . 2020 ) . In spite of the multiple 62 measures taken by countries globally , containing the virus has been challenging . Initially , 63 contact and droplet - mediated transmission were considered as major modes of transmission 64 for the SARS - CoV - 2 . Accordingly , to avoid contracting the disease , hand washing and social 65 distancing were the main measures suggested along with wearing masks . The alarmingly 66 increasing number of cases of COVID - 19 globally raised the possibility of airborne 67 transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 ( The Lancet Respiratory 2020 ) . The antecedent of SARS - CoV - 68 2 , SARS - CoV - 1 , which had an outbreak in 2002 - 2004 , was reported to spread through air 69 ( Li , Huang et al . 2005 , Yu , Wong et al . 2005 ) and through viral aerosols generated by 70 patients ( Booth , Kournikakis et al . 2005 ) . Apart from SARS - CoV - 1 , other viruses - Norwalk 71 like virus ( Marks , Vipond et al . 2003 ) , respiratory syncytial virus ( Kulkarni , Smith et al . 72 2016 ) , MERS ( Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ) coronavirus ( Kim , Chang et al . 2016 ) and 73 Influenza A / H591 virus between ferrets ( Herfst , Schrauwen et al . 2012 ) were also reported to 74 have the possibility of airborne transmission . Considering that these viruses , especially 75 SARS - CoV - 1 and MERS virus , which are closely related to SARS - CoV - 2 , were capable of 76 getting transmitted through air , the possibility of airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 77 cannot be ruled out ( Morawska and Cao 2020 , The Lancet Respiratory 2020 ) . It has been 78 observed that SARS - CoV - 2 is quite stable in aerosols ( van Doremalen , Bushmaker et al . 79 2020 ) and that it is more stable in aerosols when compared to SARS - CoV - 1 and MERS 80 ( Fears , Klimstra et al . 2020 ) . 81 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 There are existing reports of surface and environment contamination with SARS - CoV - 2 in 82 hospital rooms of COVID - 19 positive patients ( Birgand , Peiffer - Smadja et al . 2020 , Chia , 83 Coleman et al . 2020 , Liu , Ning et al . 2020 , López , Romo Á et al . 2020 ) . A study by Lednicky 84 et al . ( 2020 ) has provided evidence for the presence of viable SARS - CoV - 2 in the air samples 85 collected from hospital room with COVID - 19 patient even in the absence of any aerosol 86 generating procedure ( Lednicky , Lauzardo et al . 2020 ) . Rami et al . ( 2020 ) also suggested 87 that , in hospitals , droplets containing SARS - CoV - 2 , with strong directional airflow , can 88 spread the virus farther than 2 meters ( Sommerstein , Fux et al . 2020 ) . A study in Wuhan 89 found that air samples collected using robot assisted air sampling from hospitals , were 90 positive for SARS - CoV - 2 and COVID - 19 patients who had recovered and were ready for 91 discharge , exhaled the virus in the air ( Zhou , Yao et al . 2021 ) . A systematic review of 73 92 studies published on presence of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in air suggested that the concentration 93 of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was higher in indoor air as compared to outdoor air and in indoor , it 94 was higher in hospital and healthcare settings as compared to that in community indoor 95 settings ( Dinoi , Feltracco et al . 2022 ) . A pilot study on environmental sampling of SARS - 96 CoV - 2 in indoor residential settings involving two self - quarantined COVID - 19 patients 97 detected SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in the air in the rooms ( Nannu Shankar , Witanachchi et al . 98 2022 ) . Another study involving non - healthcare setting , a university dormitory housing 99 quarantined individuals , detected SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in surface swabs collected from the 100 HVAC filters and bathroom exhaust grilles ( Pan , Hawks et al . 2022 ) . 101 To get further insights on transmission characteristics of SARS - CoV - 2 in air in hospital and 102 indoor residential settings , and to assess the risk for healthcare workers and the caretakers , we 103 analyzed air samples using three sampling strategies - i ) air sample collection from different 104 locations of hospitals , ii ) air sample collection from closed rooms in which either one or more 105 COVID positive individuals spent only short time , and iii ) air sample collection from rooms 106 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 of houses of home - quarantine COVID - 19 positive individuals . We found that SARS - CoV - 2 107 RNA is detected in the air in hospital and residential indoor settings housing COVID - 19 108 patients . It is detected at different distances from the patient , over different time scales . The 109 study provides evidence for the long - range transport of the SARS - CoV - 2 through the air . 110 Importantly , the virus collected from air could infect cells in culture , thus , hinting towards the 111 possibility of airborne transmission for SARS - CoV - 2 . 112 2 . Methods : 113 2 . 1 Ethical Approval : The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of 114 CSIR - Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology ( IEC - 83 / 2020 ) . Informed consent from 115 subjects was taken wherever required . 116 2 . 2 Hospital settings : Air samples were collected from three hospitals from Hyderabad , 117 India - Hospital 1 , Hospital 2 and Hospital 3 , in between September 2020 to January 2021 ; 118 and three other hospitals from Mohali , India – Hospital 4 , Hospital 5 and Hospital 6 in 119 between July 2020 to December 2020 . Hospital 1 is a large tertiary care government hospital , 120 being exclusively used for COVID care at the time of sample collection . Hospital 2 is a 121 private trust hospital catering to very limited number of COVID patients while Hospital 3 is a 122 tertiary care government set - up catering to a moderate number of COVID patients along with 123 other medical services . Hospital 4 , Hospital 5 and Hospital 6 are all tertiary care hospitals 124 catering to moderate number of COVID and non - COVID patients . Air samples were 125 collected from COVID - intensive - care units ( ICUs ) occupied by COVID - 19 patients , nurse 126 stations , COVID wards , corridors , non - COVID wards , PPE doffing areas , COVID rooms , OP 127 corridors , mortuary , COVID casualty areas , non - COVID ICUs and doctors’ rooms . The 128 details of air sampling conditions are mentioned in Supplementary / Data in brief Tables 2 and 129 3 . 130 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 2 . 3 Closed - room controlled experiments : Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID - 131 19 positive individuals were asked to sit in a closed room during air sample collection 132 procedure without wearing masks ( Figure 1 ) . The mildly symptomatic individuals had mild 133 cough and fever , but did not require hospitalization . Immediately after sample collection 134 procedure was over , they were allowed to leave the room . Air samples from the closed room 135 were collected prior to arrival of the COVID - 19 positive individuals , from distances between 136 4 - 12 feet from the individual , immediately after their departure and 2 - 6 hours post their 137 departure . The pre - arrival and post departure samples were collected from the place where 138 the participants sat in the room . These experiments were conducted in September 2020 . The 139 details of air sampling conditions are mentioned in Table 2 . Figure 1 shows the schematic 140 representing the sampling conditions in closed room . 141 2 . 4 Air sample collection from houses of home - quarantine COVID - 19 patients : Air 142 samples were collected from houses of four families with at least one member positive for 143 COVID - 19 at the time of sampling , during November - December 2020 . Air samples were 144 collected from various rooms , like bedroom , kitchen , living room , bathroom and lunch area , 145 that were occupied by COVID - 19 positive and negative members of the four families . 146 2 . 5 Swab sample collection : Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in viral transfer medium 147 ( VTM ) from the participants of the closed - room control study and the house study . The Ct 148 values are shown in Table 2 and Supplementary / Data in brief Table 4 . The swabs were 149 processed according to standard procedures and SARS - CoV - 2 viral RNA Ct values were 150 determined . 151 2 . 6 Air sample collection : Air samples were collected on disposable gelatin filters 152 ( Sartorius , Cat . No . 17528 - 80 - ACD ) using AirPort MD8 air sampler ( Sartorius , Cat . No . 153 16757 ) . 1000 liters of air was collected at a flow rate of 50 liters per minute and a sampling 154 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 time of 20 minutes . After sample collection , the gelatin membrane was aseptically removed , 155 dissolved in 4 ml of Tris - EDTA buffer ( 10mM Tris and 0 . 1mM EDTA ; pH 7 . 4 ) or VTM at 156 37°C in a water bath for 10 minutes or till it completely dissolved . 1 ml of sample was used 157 for RNA extraction and the remaining was stored at - 80°C . Samples collected during 158 sampling 1 at Hospital 4 and 5 in Mohali , were collected using Whatman filter paper placed 159 on 90 mm petri dish using Merck’s MAS - 100® series air sampler , 1000 L at a rate of 100 160 liters per minute . 161 2 . 7 RNA extraction and Real Time - RT - PCR : 1ml sample containing dissolved gelatin 162 membrane was used for RNA extraction by guanidinium thiocyanate - phenol - chloroform 163 extraction - column method . The sample was lysed using QIAzol Lysis Reagent ( Qiagen , Cat . 164 No . 79306 ) and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes . After adding chloroform , 165 mixing and centrifuging at 12 , 000 X g for 10 minutes at 4  C , the RNA containing aqueous 166 layer was used for RNA isolation using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit ( Qiagen ; Cat No . ID : 167 52906 ) according to manufacturer’s protocol . The extracted RNA was used for SARS - CoV - 2 168 E gene , N gene and ORF1ab gene detection using Fosun COVID - 19 RT - PCR Detection Kit 169 ( Shanghai Fosun Long March Medical Science Co . , Ltd ; Cat . No . PCSYHF03 - a ) . RT - PCR 170 was run on QuantStudio TM 5 Real Time PCR system . RT - PCR was done in triplicates for 171 each sample and data was analysed using Design and Analysis Software v1 . 5 . 1 172 QuantStudio TM 5 . For sampling 1 of Hospital 4 and 5 at Mohali , RNA was isolated using 173 AURA PURE Viral RNA Isolation Kit ( Aura Biotechnologies Private Ltd . , Cat . No . MNP - 174 R004 - 100 ) and RT - PCR was performed using TRUPCR ® COVID - 19 Real - Time RT - PCR 175 Kit ( 3B Blackbio Biotech India Ltd ; Cat No . 3B304 ) . 176 2 . 8 Infection of CCL - 81 Vero cells with SARS - CoV - 2 collected from air : SARS - CoV - 2 177 positive air samples were used for infecting CCL - 81 Vero cells in Biosafely Level - 3 ( BSL - 3 ) 178 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 laboratory settings . The air samples in gelatinous medium ( TE ) that were stored at - 80°C , 179 were first thawed at 37°C and concentrated with 100 kDa centrifugal filter ( 37°C ) and 180 resuspended in serum free DMEM . It must be noted that , since the samples had undergone a 181 freeze - thaw cycle , some loss in culturable virus is expected . Before infection , the sample was 182 filter - sterilized ( 0 . 45µm ) and added to Vero monolayers in 96 - well plate . Three hours post - 183 infection , the media was replaced with fresh 10 % serum containing media . The infected cells 184 were further incubated at 37°C with 5 % CO2 in a humidified chamber and cytopathic effects 185 ( CPE ) were examined every 24 hours for five to six days . Cells along with the supernatants 186 were collected from those wells displaying CPE and transferred to fresh 48 - well plate 187 containing Vero monolayers for further propagation . This process of viral passaging and 188 culture scale up continued for 5 passage and at each level viral supernatant collected and 189 stored in - 80°C freezers for further use . For each passage viral supernatant was quantified by 190 SARS - CoV - 2 specific primers ( LabGenomics ; Labgun COVID - 19 RT - PCR kit ; CV9032B ) 191 against RdRP and E gene . The later passage supernatants with sufficient volume were titrated 192 for infectious particle count by plaque - forming assay . 193 3 . Results : 194 3 . 1 Detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in hospital air samples : We analyzed a total of 80 air 195 samples from various locations at hospitals from two cities in India - Hyderabad and Mohali . 196 Air samples were collected from COVID ICUs , nurse stations , COVID wards , corridors , non - 197 COVID wards , PPE doffing areas , COVID rooms , OP corridors , mortuary , COVID casualty 198 areas , non - COVID ICUs and doctors’ rooms from hospitals . Out of the 80 samples collected , 199 30 samples were positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA ( Table 1 and Supplementary / Data in brief 200 Table 1 ) . From Hyderabad , 57 air samples were collected from 3 hospitals . Out of 57 , 30 201 samples showed the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA ( Table 1 and Supplementary / Data in 202 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 brief Table 1 ) . From Mohali , 23 air samples were collected from 3 hospitals . Among these , 203 10 samples showed the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA ( Table 1 and Supplementary / Data in 204 brief Table 1 ) . 205 Table 1 : Detection of SARS - CoV - 2 at various locations of hospitals in Hyderabad and 206 Mohali 207 Hospital / Sampling No .

A total of 210 23 air samples were collected from indicated locations of hospitals 4 - 6 in Mohali and 211 analyzed for the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . 212 3 . 2 Detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in air in closed room experiments : To understand 213 how far and for how long SARS - CoV - 2 can be detected in the air , when COVID - 19 positive 214 individuals spend a short time in closed room , we analyzed air samples at different distances 215 from COVID - 19 positive individuals and at different time points . One or 3 participants were 216 made to sit in one corner of a room with no perceived air flow for short span of time and air 217 samples were collected at varying distances from them ( Figure 1 ) . When one participant was 218 present , he was positioned at a specific distance from the air sampler . When 3 participants 219 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 were present in the room , they were positioned in such a manner that the distance between 220 each participant and the air sampler was same . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected 5 out of 17 221 samples collected ( Table 2 ) . Importantly , samples collected post departure of the patients 222 from the room were also positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . 223 224 Figure 1 : Schematic representation of a room from where air samples were collected for 225 analysis of SARS - CoV - 2 : COVID - 19 positive individuals were instructed to sit in a closed 226 room and air samples were collected from 4 , 8 and 12 feet from them and analysed for the 227 presence of SARS - CoV - 2 by PCR 228 Table 2 : Analysis of air samples from closed room occupied by COVID - 19 positive 229 individuals 230 No . of Individuals Symptoms Swab Ct Distance / Condition SARS - CoV - 2 detection in air Time spent J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 16 in room value 1 Asymptomatic 28 . 87 4 feet No Sampling time 12 feet No 20 minutes + Sampling time 3 Asymptomatic 28 . 87 , 31 . 76 , 32 . 47 4 feet Yes Sampling time 12 feet No 20 minutes + Sampling time Pre - Arrival No 0 minutes Departure Yes 40 minutes Post - departure 2 - 6 hrs Yes 40 minutes 1 Asymptomatic 27 . 57 4 feet No Sampling time 8 feet No 20 minutes + Sampling time 12 feet No 40 minutes + Sampling time Departure No 60 minutes 3 Mild symptoms 29 . 1 , 19 . 85 , N * 4 feet No Sampling time 8 feet No 20 minutes + Sampling time 12 feet No 40 minutes + Sampling time Pre - Arrival No 0 minutes J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 17 Departure Yes 60 minutes Post - departure 2 - 6 hrs Yes 60 minutes Table 2 : Analysis of air samples from closed room occupied by COVID - 19 positive 231 individuals : 7 COVID - 19 positive individuals were asked to spend indicated time in a closed 232 room during air sample collection . Each sampling was performed for 20 minutes . Air samples 233 were collected at the indicated distances from the individuals and analyzed for the presence 234 of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . N * indicates ‘information not available’ 235 3 . 3 Detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in air from rooms of houses of home - 236 quarantined COVID - 19 patients : To get a better insight about the airborne transmission of 237 SARS - CoV - 2 , air samples were collected from the rooms of houses of home - quarantined 238 COVID - 19 patients . Samples were collected from houses of three families with one or more 239 members infected with SARS - CoV - 2 ( Table 3 ) . The first family consisted of 3 members . One 240 of the members had symptoms like fever , sore throat , tiredness and cough , and was detected 241 positive for COVID - 19 , one day prior to the study . The member was immediately room 242 quarantined . Next day , nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from all the three family 243 members . The individual , who previously tested positive , was confirmed positive and the 244 other two individuals in the family were found to be negative for COVID - 19 ( Supplementary / 245 Data in brief Table 4 ) on the day of study . Air samples were collected from the bedroom 246 occupied by the patient , other family member’s bedroom , hall , kitchen and bathroom . Sample 247 collected from the patient’s bedroom , when he was not wearing mask and was not talking , 248 was positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA , whereas all other air samples were negative ( Table 3 ) . 249 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 18 The second family consisted of 5 members , of which 2 were reported COVID - 19 positive one 250 day prior to the study ( Table 3 ) . Both had fever previously , but were asymptomatic during the 251 day of air sample collection . They were quarantined in separate rooms . Nasopharyngeal swab 252 test on the day of air sampling confirmed the positivity of the two patients and the negativity 253 of the remaining 3 members ( Supplementary / Data in brief Table 4 ) . Air samples were 254 collected at a distance of 2 and 4 meters from one of the positive individuals who wore mask 255 and was conversing on phone during sample collection . Both the samples were negative for 256 SARS - CoV - 2 . Air samples were collected at a distance of 1 . 5 and 3 . 5 meters from second 257 positive individual who was not wearing mask . Both the samples were found to be positive 258 for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . Two more samples were collected from the house of this family - one 259 from hall occupied by three COVID - 19 negative individuals and the other from a room 260 occupied by one COVID - 19 negative individual . Both the samples were found negative for 261 SARS - CoV - 2 ( Table 3 ) . 262 The third family consisted of 6 members ( Table 3 ) . Prior to the study , only 2 members were 263 known to be positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . The family members did not wear mask at home , 264 were not room quarantined and interacted with each other verbally during the sampling event . 265 On the first day of sampling , nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from all the six members 266 and all of them were found to be positive for COVID - 19 ( Supplementary / Data in brief Table 267 4 ) . Air samples were collected from 1 . 5 and 3 meter from patient 1 , who was previously 268 known to be positive . Both the air samples were found to be positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . 269 Another air sample , collected from the bedroom of patient 1 , which was unoccupied by the 270 patient during sample collection , was found to be positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . The room 271 was vacated by the patient at least 2 hours before sample collection , indicating that , SARS - 272 CoV - 2 can stay in the air of closed rooms for at least 2 hours . Next day , another four air 273 samples , collected from the hall and dining room occupied by the COVID - 19 positive 274 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 19 individuals , and bathroom and bedroom , previously occupied , but unoccupied during sample 275 collection , were found to be positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA ( Table 3 ) . 276 Table 3 : Analysis of air samples collected from houses of COVID - 19 positive individuals 277 Family details Air sampling condition SARS - CoV - 2 RNA detection Family 1 - 3 Members , 1 Patient Patient bedroom Yes Family member ' s bedroom No Bathroom No Hall No Kitchen No Family 2 - 5 Members , 2 Patients 4 meter from Patient 1 No 2 meter from Patient 1 No 3 . 5 meter from Patient 2 Yes 1 . 5 meter from Patient 2 Yes Hall - Occupied by 3 COVID - ve individuals No Room - Occupied by 1 COVID - ve individual No Family 3 - 6 members , 6 Patients Sampling day 1 - 1 . 5 meter from patient 1 Yes Sampling day 1 - 3 meter from patient 1 Yes Sampling day 1 - Patient 1 room , vacated 2 hours before sampling Yes Sampling day 2 - Hall - Occupied by patients Yes Sampling day 2 - Dining room - Occupied by patients Yes Sampling day 2 - Bathroom - Unoccupied Yes Sampling day 2 - Bedroom - Unoccupied Yes J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 20 Table 3 : Analysis of air samples collected from houses of COVID - 19 positive 278 individuals : Air samples were collected from different locations of houses of three families 279 having at least one COVID - 19 patient . Sampling time was 20 minutes . 280 Three SARS - CoV - 2 RNA positive air samples from the third house study that had 281 relatively lower Ct values ( expected to have relatively higher viral load ) were used for 282 infecting vero cells in culture . Out of the three samples , one sample established culture . The 283 details of the culture are provided in Supplementary / Data in brief Table 5 . 284 4 . Discussion : 285 In the initial phases of the pandemic , the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 was largely thought to 286 be through contact and droplet spread , in general public opinion . However , with studies 287 reporting transmission among physically distanced individuals in closed spaces with air 288 conditioning ( Lu , Gu et al . 2020 , Sommerstein , Fux et al . 2020 ) and the fact that , the viral 289 spread could not be effectively curbed in spite of strict lockdowns in various countries of the 290 world , raised the possibility of airborne transmission . This line of thought was substantiated 291 by previous studies which detected viral RNA or live virus in the air ( Wu , Shen et al . 2010 , 292 Bing , Zhang et al . 2018 ) . Aerosol mediated transmission is not limited to human viruses , for 293 example , in swine it is known that porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus 294 ( PRRSV ) is transmitted via an aerosol route ( Nirmala , Alves et al . 2021 ) . CDC released a 295 statement acknowledging the possibility of air borne transmission in certain scenarios for 296 SARS - CoV - 2 ( https : / / www . cdc . gov / coronavirus / 2019 - ncov / more / scientific - brief - sars - cov - 297 2 . html ) . 298 In our study , SARS - CoV - 2 could be detected in the air collected from various COVID care 299 areas with no specific predilection towards ICU / non - ICU areas in the hospitals ( P = 0 . 5492 ; 300 Table 4 ) . The virus could not be detected in any of the non - COVID care areas . The positivity 301 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 21 rate was found to be more when the number of COVID patients were higher in the room . The 302 SARS - CoV - 2 RNA positivity percentage was 58 % when 2 or more COVID - 19 patients were 303 present in a room , in contrast to 24 . 62 % when 1 or 0 COVID - 19 patients occupied the room . 304 ( P = 0 . 0185 ; Table 5 ) . A point to be highlighted from the hospital experiments was that in 305 many of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA positive samples , the air sampler was at least 8 feet away from 306 the nearest patient . As there is no record on events that occurred in the sampling area before 307 the sample collection began , we are unable to infer this finding . But this may be an indicator 308 that long term presence of COVID positive patients in an enclosed space may contribute to a 309 significant increase in aerosol burden in the air . These findings have significant implications 310 in the current situation , when many countries have relaxed the restrictions on public mobility 311 and interactions . In many densely populated nations where the recommended physical 312 distancing norms may be difficult to implement in public / office spaces , distancing as much 313 as possible with usage of masks should be actively promoted . 314 Table : 4 : Table showing the data for total number of SARS - CoV - 2 positive samples in 315 COVID - ICU and non - ICU areas in hospitals in Hyderabad and Mohali 316 Criteria Hyderabad Mohali Total % positive Total no . of air samples collected 57 23 80 37 . 5 Total no . of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA positive air samples 20 10 30 Total no . of air samples collected from COVID ICUs 11 11 22 45 . 45 Total no . of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA positive air samples from COVID ICUs 5 5 10 Total no . of air samples collected from non - ICUs 46 12 58 34 . 48 Total no . of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA positive air samples from non - ICUs 15 5 20 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 22 Table : 4 : Table showing the data for total number of SARS - CoV - 2 positive air samples 317 in COVID - ICU and non - ICU areas in hospitals in Hyderabad and Mohali : Significance 318 was calculated between the number of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA positive samples in COVID - ICU 319 and non - ICU groups , using Odd’s ratio with 95 % confidence interval .

Most of the previous 333 studies have not executed this kind of control experiment where the COVID - 19 patients spent 334 short time in a closed room and air samples are analysed for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . Since the 335 only source of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in the air in the closed room are the patients who are 336 present in the room during air sample collection , the PCR signal in the air samples in this 337 condition is from the viral particles released by the patients and not from RNA contamination 338 from any other source . The detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in the air in the closed - control - 339 rooms and the rooms of houses of home quarantined COVID - 19 patients , suggest that SARS - 340 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 24 CoV - 2 is released by COVID - 19 patients in the air and that it can stay in the air for some 341 time in absence of ventilation in the closed spaces . It also indicates that the chances of 342 finding SARS - CoV - 2 in the air in closed room are higher if more number of COVID - 19 343 positive individuals occupy the room . The SARS - CoV - 2 RNA positivity percentage was 75 % 344 when 2 or more COVID - 19 patients were present in a room in closed - room control study and 345 the house study , in contrast to 15 . 79 % when 1 or 0 COVID - 19 patients occupied the room in 346 these studies . ( P = 0 . 0326 ; Table 5 ) . Our observations are concurrent with previous studies 347 that suggest that the concentration of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA is higher in indoor air as compared 348 to outdoor air ; and in indoor , it is higher in hospital and healthcare settings that host more 349 number of COVID - 19 patients , as compared to that in community indoor settings ( Dinoi , 350 Feltracco et al . 2022 ) . 351 It is to be noted that many of the air samples from hospitals and closed room experiments 352 showed PCR signal for one of the SARS - CoV - 2 genes or had very high Ct values . The 353 possibility that live infectious SARS - CoV - 2 being actually present in these air samples 354 cannot be ruled out completely considering the diluting effect due to diffusion of the virus in 355 the air and the fact that only 1000 liters ( 1 cubic meter ) of air was sampled each time . The 356 limit of detection ( LoD ) for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in air is 1200 copies in our experimental 357 setup . In this study , out of the 3 air samples with relatively lower Ct values , we could 358 establish live culture for one of the air samples . Another study by Nannu Shankar et al . also 359 attempted culturing of SARS - CoV - 2 using vero cells , but their cells were contaminated by 360 Human adenovirus B3 ( HAdVB3 ) that killed the Vero E6 cell cultures ( Nannu Shankar , 361 Witanachchi et al . 2022 ) . This is because the samples collected from air are mixed samples 362 consisting of other bacteria and virus along with SARS - CoV - 2 . Whether initiating an 363 infection in an individual has a different viral titer threshold from that needed for establishing 364 a virus culture , is still unclear . A study found that an intranasal dose of 100PFU of SARS - 365 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 25 CoV - 2 was sufficient to infect Syrian hamsters ( Brocato , Principe et al . 2020 ) . Another 366 computational study estimated that SARS - CoV - 2 particles in the range of hundreds is 367 sufficient to establish infection in humans ( Basu 2021 ) . Even though virus is diluted in the 368 air , considering that such a low number of viral particles is sufficient to cause infection , 369 aerosol mediated transmission can contribute substantially to the infection load due to SARS - 370 CoV2 . 371 Conclusions : Our results indicate that SARS - CoV - 2 is released by COVID - 19 patients in the 372 air . If higher number of symptomatic COVID - 19 patients are present in a closed space , the 373 chances of finding SARS - CoV - 2 in air are higher . SARS - CoV - 2 released by COVID - 19 374 patients in air can be infective . Following physical distancing along with wearing masks can 375 help in preventing the spread of infection . 376 Author contributions : Shivranjani C Moharir : Conceptualization , data curation ; formal 377 analysis , project administration , writing original draft , investigation , methodology ; T 378 Sharath Chandra , Arushi Goel , Bhuwaneshwar Thakur , Dixit Tandel , S Reddy 379 Mahesh , Amareshwar Vodapalli , Gurpreet Singh Bhalla , Dinesh Kumar , Digvijay 380 Singh Naruka : Data curation , formal analysis , investigation ; Ashwani Kumar , Amit Tuli 381 and Karthik Bharadwaj Tallapaka : Conceptualization , data curation ; formal analysis , 382 investigation , methodology , review and editing ; Swathi Suravaram , Thrilok Chander 383 Bingi , Srinivas M , Rajarao Mesipogu , Krishna Reddy , Sanjeev Khosla , Krishnan H 384 Harshan : Conceptualization , supervision ; and Rakesh K Mishra : Conceptualization , 385 methodology , investigation , project administration , writing - review and edit , supervision , 386 fund acquisition 387 Acknowledgements : The authors thank COVID - 19 positive individuals who allowed us to 388 take air samples from their vicinity . 389 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 26 Conflict of interest : The authors declare no conflict of interest . 390 Competing interests : The authors declare no competing interests . 391 This research was supported by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research ( CSIR ) . 392 References : 393 Baj , J . , H .
