Both methods assessed 3 mandibular positions in 10 asymptomatic males and 10 asymptomatic females , aged 23 to 37 years , free from temporomandibular disorders : maximum intercuspation , bimanually manipulated centric relation , and the unguided neuromuscular position . Bite registrations were obtained for bimanual operator guidance and neuromuscular position . 3 T MRI scans of both temporomandibular joints produced 3D data of the most superior condylar points in all 3 mandibular positions . Using mounted plaster casts and the same bite registrations , an electronic CPI displayed 3D data of its condylar spheres in these positions . The results showed interclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0 . 03 to 0 . 66 ( 95 % confidence intervals from 0 to 0 . 8 ) and significantly different condyle positions between both methods ( p = 0 . 0012 , p < 0 . 001 ) . The implications of the study emphasize that condyle position is unpredictable and variable . Its exact knowledge requires radiological imaging and should not rely on CPI assessments . The condylar position indicator ( CPI ) is a modified articulator for instrumental functional analysis of the masti - catory organ ( Fig . 1 ) 1 . CPIs quantify differences between two mandibular positions at the condylar levels and the incisal pin . Using bite registrations and mounted casts of the dentition , CPIs measure the slide of the mandible between centric relation and maximum intercuspation or forced bite positions or traumatic occlusal contacts 2 , 3 . CPIs are also used by maxillofacial surgeons , e . g . for determination of postoperative condylar displacement 4 . As CPIs reproduce condylar positions mechanically , a comparison of the in vitro CPI data with those found in vivo is justified 5 . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) epitomizes the state of art for visualisation of articular tissues in vivo 6 and offers a trustworthy reference for comparison of anatomic structures with mechanical replicas . Consequently , the aim of the current study was to evaluate to which extent MRI and CPI agree in determining condyle positions . Our null hypothesis stated that no differences exist between CPI and MRI condylar position data . Subjects , materials and methods This study was approved by the university ethics commission ( Ethikkommission der Medizinischen Universität Wien , ECS1438 / 2015 ) . The authors confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations . In compliance with the STROBE guidelines on reporting observational studies , recruitment of healthy dental students commenced in the preclinical curriculum over a period of 18 months . All volunteer participants were unaffected by any anamnestic sign and symptom of temporomandibular dysfunction . Seven individuals were excluded from participation because of disc displacement and / or masticatory muscle pain , another 2 could not partake in the MRI scans due to intrauterine metal coils . The definitive sample consisted of 10 women and 10 men . This sample size is in accordance with Kandasamy et al . 7 , whose power analysis yielded n = 19 for 3 different mandibular positions to produce 80 % power for detection of mean differences ≤ 1 mm at a significance level of 0 . 05 . The female ages averaged 26 . 7 ± 2 . 4y , the male ages 27 ± 3 . 3y ( total range 23 – 37 years ) . Informed consent was given after thorough briefing of all planned procedures . Inclusion criteria embraced full permanent dentition irrespective of 3rd molars , distinct occlusion with unam - biguous intercuspation , asymptomatic temporomandibular joints ( TMJs ) without noise , mandibular movements without limitation ( mouth opening > 40 mm , protrusion and laterotrusions ≥ 8 mm ) , and clear intercuspation of dental casts .

Subjective signs and symptoms of facial pain and craniomandibular disorder were evaluated by question - naire and interview . Further , a single , proficient and experienced clinician palpated head and neck muscles and made multidirectional tractions of the mandible for exclusion of capsulitis and disc displacement . He also tested muscle fatigue or pain during 20 - s isometric closure , protrusion , and lateral movements of the mandible . Once the asymptomatic condition was confirmed clinically , the bite registrations were taken during the same appoint - ment . Our protocol stipulated guided and unguided techniques for accomplishing two condylar positions , both not dictated by dental occlusion : bimanual manipulation ( BM ) and neuromuscular method ( NM ) 8 – 12 . Bimanual manipulation . A fused double - layered wax plate ( 1 . 5 mm Beauty Pink X Hard , Miltex Inc . , York , PA , USA ) covered the buccal cusps and incisal edges of the upper dental arch without interference with soft tissues . A third wax layer augmented the plate’s anterior part . Examinees sat in a slightly reclined position with their head supported by a headrest , gently holding a cotton roll between upper and lower bicuspids for 5 - min deprogramming of the musculature . The examiner removed the cotton roll and positioned the softened wax plate on the air - dried upper teeth . Jaw openings and closures without tooth contact were reiterated 5 times , then the examiner took over and freely hinged the mandible . With his fingers at the posterior and inferior mandibular margins but the thumbs at the chin , the operator pulled the posterior mandible heavily upward and simultane - ously pressed the chin downward . The manipulation produced 0 . 5 to 1 mm impressions in the wax at a vertical bite separation of approximately 2 mm between the first molars . Repetition of the jaw manipulation verified the BM position . Its unambiguous repeatability was given in all 20 examinees . Neuromuscular bite registration . NM is a patient - generated technique , which records an unguided mandibular position right before intercuspal contact . For elimination of sensory occlusal contact inputs , 5 - min deprogramming of the musculature was accomplished with a cotton roll between upper and lower bicuspids . Patients sat slightly reclined , leaning their head against the dental chair’s headrest . After removal of the cotton , they started slow mandibular up - and - down movements of approximately 3 mm without any antagonist tooth contact during hinging the jaw . The NM position was recorded after 3 min of slow cyclic movements using poly - vinyl siloxane ( Blue Bite SC , Pluradent , Offenbach , Germany ) at 2 mm vertical separation of the first molars . We verified the NM position by immediate repetition , which had to show a clear fit to the first polyvinyl siloxane impressions . CPI . Alginate impressions of the dental arches ( Orthoprint , Zhermack , Marl , Germany ) were poured with plaster ( Die - Keen Green , Kulzer , South Bend , IN , USA ) . After trimming and removal of surface plaster bubbles , we meticulously examined the unambiguous fit of the casts in maximum intercuspation . The SAM anatomical Figure 1 .

Mounting the casts in ICP defined this maximum intercuspation as the zero position of the CPI coordinate system . We verified all mounting procedures with split - cast tests , i . e . checking the exact fit of the mounting plates after removal of the magnet . The casts were transferred from the articulator into an electronic CPI ( Kondymeter , Vamed , Graz , Austria ) . The CPI displayed left and right Cartesian coordinates of the condylar spheres in increments of 0 . 01 mm for ICP , BM , and NM in 3D with 6 measuring gauges ( Fig . 1 ) . Two operators conducted the measurements separately under mutual surveillance . Before each measurement , the operators calibrated all gauges to zero while the casts were exactly positioned in ICP . For measurements of BM and NM , the individual bite registrations were carefully placed into the CPI . The operators also put weights onto the centre of the CPI’s upper part for its stabilization during every measurement ( 5 . 5 kg , using iron discs of 3 kg and 1 . 25 kg ) . Both operators read the displayed xyz values concurrently , transcribed them into an Excel file ( Office 2016 , Microsoft Corporation , Redmond , USA ) , and checked for typing mistakes . Each BM and NM position was measured twice and averaged . MRI . We thoroughly instructed all participants prior to the MRI examination of both TMJs . Instructions included ( i ) diligent maintenance of the ICP and the bite registration occlusions during the scans and ( ii ) avoid - ance of body movements . Head movements were limited by restriction pads . After scanning the radiologist screened all MRIs for exclusion of pathological alterations . The technical specifications of the MRI scanner were Magnetom Skyra ( Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) , field strength 3 T , 16 - channel head - neck coil , scans of 5 min and 30 s for sagittal and coronal slices , proton weighted TSE images ( TR 2300 ms , TE 10 ms ) , flip angle 160° , averages 2 , concatenation 1 , band width 300 Hz / Px , distance factor 10 % , image resolution 0 . 3 × 0 . 3 × 2 mm voxels , field of view 17 cm . A transversal localizer scan was used for detection of condyle position , paracoronal slices were aligned to the axis of the condylar head . Sagittal slices were adjusted at right angles to the condylar head axis and parallel to the long axis of the mandibular ramus . We omitted dynamic MRI sequences because of their reduced image resolution and movement artefacts . Three MRI runs recorded ICP , NM , and BM condyle positions . The latter were scanned with intraorally repositioned polyvinyl siloxane and ice - water chilled wax bite registrations , respectively . Different bite registration materials prevented their wrong use for the particular scan . 3D processing of the MRI data with a medical imaging viewer ( Osirix MD ; Pixmeo SARL , Geneva , Swit - zerland ) yielded Cartesian coordinates of the measuring points . Zoomed to 600 % , we determined the most superior condylar points on central slices of the mandibular condyles in ICP , BM , and NM ( Fig . 2 ) . To avoid observer variation , two investigators jointly determined every measuring point twice and transferred the data under mutual control into an MS Excel file . The same algebraic signs were used for both MRI and CPI coordinate systems . Positive signs indicated cranial location along the superior – inferior axis , lateral location to the right , and posterior position in anterior – posterior direction . For assessment of measuring point identification errors , the same operators synchronously reiterated meas - uring point location on every MRI scan of the ICP after 6 days . CPI measurements were repeated following the same protocol and both methods evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs ) . Figure 2 .

All statistical computations were done using R software , version 4 . 1 . 1 ( R Core Team 2021 , Vienna , Austria ) . Calculations of Euclidean distances have been the square root of the sum of the squared differences in all three dimensions . Prediction ellipses based on Hotelling’s T 2 were added to 2D scatterplots 13 . Plots of the agreement between CPI and MRI condylar positions are shown with reference to the line of identity and accord - ing to Bland and Altman 14 . ICCs and their 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated for intra - rater reli - ability according to a mixed model formulation 15 , 16 . The CIs refer to 9999 bootstrap replications of the response residuals , i . e . a semi - parametric bootstrap , and p - values were calculated by inversion of these CIs 17 . The percent - age of deviation from the line of identity was calculated in increments of 0 . 5 mm . Results Reproducibility of CPI and MRI measurements . ICCs of repeated CPI measurements of all left and right condylar sphere positions showed 0 . 98 for NM ( 95 % CI 0 . 96 , 0 . 99 ) and 0 . 97 for BM ( 95 % CI 0 . 93 , 0 . 99 ) in lateral – medial direction . In anterior – posterior direction , ICCs were 0 . 93 ( 0 . 87 , 0 . 96 ) for NM and 0 . 77 ( 0 . 61 , 0 . 87 ) for BM . In superior – inferior direction , NM ICCs equalled 0 . 87 ( 0 . 77 , 0 . 93 ) and BM 0 . 80 ( 0 . 67 , 0 . 89 ) . ICCs of repeated MRI measurements showed 0 . 92 for NM ( 95 % CI 0 . 85 , 0 . 96 ) and 0 . 90 for BM ( 95 % CI 0 . 82 , 0 . 94 ) in lateral – medial direction . In anterior – posterior direction , ICCs were 0 . 95 ( 0 . 90 , 0 . 97 ) for NM and 0 . 95 ( 0 . 92 , 0 . 98 ) for BM . In superior – inferior direction , NM ICCs equalled 0 . 92 ( 0 . 86 , 0 . 96 ) and BM 0 . 94 ( 0 . 89 , 0 . 97 ) . CPI and MRI condylar positions . Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics for the left and right 1D condylar positions along the anterior – posterior axis ( x ) , superior – inferior axis ( y ) , and lateral – medial axis ( left – right , z ) in millimeters , separately for CPI and MRI . The smallest means and medians were found in transverse direction ( medial – lateral condylar movement ) . For all parameters , means and medians were similar whereas they differed more than 0 . 4 mm between CPI and MRI in superior – inferior direction in all instances . The Bland – Altman plots revealed wide limits of agreement for each spatial direction , ranging from 2 . 5 mm transversely to 3 . 5 mm anterior - posteriorly to 5 – 7 . 5 mm superior – inferiorly ( Fig . 3 ) . In 2D , the 95 % data ellipses of the sagittal , frontal , and horizontal planes showed little left – right difference . The CPI ellipses were smaller than the MRI ellipses except those of NM in the frontal plane . Ellipses overlapped to varying degrees ( Fig . 4 ) . Figure 5 shows the individual methodological concordance of CPI and MRI condyle positions with subject labelled identification numbers . In lateral – medial direction , the BM and NM condylar positions lie close to the line of identity . More scatter exists in anterior – posterior and superior – inferior directions .

Approximately 11 % were within 1 mm , 28 % within 1 . 5 mm , and 50 % within 2 mm . Table 3 shows the percentages up to 5 mm difference , separately for BM and NM positions . Using the ICC for methodological comparison , the coefficients ranged from 0 . 03 to 0 . 66 . Table 4 lists the coefficients , the 95 % CIs , and the derived p - values , which signified statistical difference between both methods ( p = 0 . 0012 and p < 0 . 001 ) . Discussion Indirect deductive methods are used when invasive observation is not clinically feasible . Regarding the TMJ , articulators and CPIs simulate occlusal relationships and extrapolate their effects on mandibular condyle position . The degree of truly depicting anatomical conditions with a CPI can be evaluated with established but complex imaging techniques such as MRI or CT . In our study , the ICCs of the MRI and CPI measurements of condylar position showed sufficient reproducibility for each particular method . In the Bland – Altman plots , the values scattered above and below zero , indicating no existing bias of one method versus the other . However , the limits of agreement were wide in the plots , the results therefore ambiguous and without trend but quite consistent variability . Due to the interclass correlation coefficients and their statistical significance , our assumption of no difference between CPI and MRI results had to be rejected . The percentage of CPI - MRI agreement within 0 . 5 mm was 2 . 5 % only , namely for both BM and NM positions . Greater spatial differences between corresponding MRI and CPI measuring points were almost linear and parallel in their incremental increase of the percentages up to 5 mm , regardless of manual guidance or unguided technique . Explanations for different outcomes between CPI and MRI include specific characteristics of biological entity and mechanical device . Biological features refer to joint tissue resilience , individual condyle and fossa morphol - ogy , neuromuscular action , and combinations of condylar rotation with translation even in initial opening or final closing 18 – 20 . The medial bony border of the glenoid fossa may limit medially directed condylar movements and cause vertical excursions instead ( Fig . 4B ) . These reasons may also explain that most CPI data ellipses were smaller than the MRI ellipses , particularly in the frontal and sagittal aspects . In other words , the lesser the joint play , the higher was the concordance between MRI and CPI . The CPI condylar ball has a substantially different shape than the condylar head . Consequently , the measur - ing points of both objects are diverse . Another issue relates to the anatomical facebow transfer , which offers an approximation of the spatial relationship between maxillary dentition and TMJ hinge axis . Errors from using arbitrary hinge axes instead of kinematic axes and individual variation in intercondylar distance may have contributed to different readings between CPI and MRI 1 . Finally , recumbent vs . supine body postures may have affected condyle position during data collection 21 . Searching for previous comparisons of CPI and MRI data , we found a single study on articulator mounting and MRI dating from 1993 22 . This study investigated leaf - gauge centric relation and maximum intercuspation with both methods . Although the applied methodology differed from our study in detail , the correlation coef - ficients specified “ a weak relationship between MRI and the articulator ” , too . These correlation coefficients ranged from 0 . 04 to 0 . 55 22 and do not contradict the results of the present study . Table 3 . Superimposition of CPI and MRI data .

This shortcoming indicates restrictions of mechanical instruments in replicat - ing functions of biologic systems 23 . Moreover , the ideal condyle position “ has never been found ” 24 and condyle positions of asymptomatic normals were reported to be concentric in about 50 % but posterior or anterior in about 25 % each 18 , 22 . Thus , a single conceptual tenet of where the condyle should be located when in occlusion is questionable . Without using adequate imaging techniques , condyle position is unknown in habitual occlusion and unpredictable in diagnostic reference positions 7 . MRI applications are not practical in daily routine . Without claim for overall scientific validity , the CPI may be a useful instrument for practitioners under consideration of existing errors . Accepting CPI - MRI agreement within 2 mm as a compromise 25 – 27 , the CPI will cover approximately 50 % of the MRI condylar positions but still neglect the other half . This uncertainty about the real condylar position does not dismiss the responsibility to strive for precise treatment of occlusion . Dimensions of the dentition should match the therapeutic optimum within individual tolerance . Favorable condyle positions induce minimal biomechanical stress without degenerative alteration 24 . The need for higher or lower degrees of truly replicated anatomy will also depend on the very clinical situation . Less precision might be acceptable for acrylic resin splints than for orthognathic surgery or entire occlusal restorations . Altogether , if CPI values are used , caution must prevail in the interpretation of condylar position . Limitations of our study address a selection bias by enrolling dental students only . The impracticality of repeating the MRI examination in the same individual implies absence of overall MRI reproducibility data . Repeated measurements of scans from a single MRI run may have overestimated observer reliability and may have contributed to the discrepancy between MRI and CPI measurements . Our sample size was too small for detection of gender differences and left – right asymmetries . In spite of careful split - cast testing , minor mounting errors may have affected the CPI readings . Conclusions Using data from asymptomatic young adults , mandibular condyle positions differed significantly between the in vivo condition depicted by MRI and the in vitro extrapolation from articulator condylar sphere movements ( CPI ) . Methodological agreement within 0 . 5 mm occurred in 2 . 5 % only . The present study pinpoints unpredicta - bility and huge variation of condylar positions . Exact knowledge of the actual condylar position requires imaging .
