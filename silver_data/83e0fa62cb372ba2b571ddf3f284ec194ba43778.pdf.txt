Filaments of S . cere V isiae actin bind rhodamine phalloidin more weakly than Acanthamoeba and rabbit skeletal muscle actin filaments due to a more rapid dissociation rate in spite of a significantly faster association rate constant . The higher dissociation rate constant and lower binding affinity of rhodamine phalloidin for S . cere V isiae actin filaments provide a quantitative explanation for the inefficient staining of yeast actin filaments , compared with that of rabbit skeletal muscle actin filaments [ Kron et al . ( 1992 ) Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . U . S . A . 89 , 4466 - 4470 ] . The temperature dependence of the rate constants was interpreted according to transition state theory . There is a small enthalpic difference ( ∆ H q ) between the ground states and the transition state . Consequently , the free energy of activation ( ∆ G q ) for association and dissociation of rhodamine phalloidin is dominated by entropic changes ( ∆ S q ) . At equilibrium , rhodamine phalloidin binding generates a positive entropy change ( ∆ S (cid:176) ) . The rates of rhodamine phalloidin binding are independent of the pH , ionic strength , and filament length . Rhodamine covalently bound decreases the association rate and affinity of phalloidin for actin . The association rate constant is low for both phalloidin and rhodamine phalloidin because the filaments must undergo conformational changes ( i . e . “breathe” ) to expose the phalloidin binding site [ De La Cruz , E . M . , & Pollard , T . D . ( 1994 ) Biochemistry 33 , 14387 - 14392 ] . Raising the solvent microviscosity , but not the macroviscosity , dampens these conformational fluctuations , and phalloidin binding kinetics are inhibited . Yeast actin filaments bind rhodamine phalloidin more rapidly , suggesting that perhaps they are more flexible and can breathe more easily than rabbit or Acanthamoeba actin filaments . Phalloidin , a heptapeptide toxin from the poisonous mushroom Amanita phalloides , binds tightly and specifically to polymerized actin , stabilizing the filaments from a variety of depolymerizing agents and conditions ( Wieland & Faul - stich , 1978 ) . Phalloidin decreases the critical concentration for actin polymerization by reducing the dissociation rate constant of monomers from filament ends ( Estes et al . , 1981 ) . An atomic model of the actin filament ( Lorenz et al . , 1993 ) places phalloidin at the interface of three actin subunits , where it could stabilize subunit interactions . The association rate constant for rhodamine phalloidin binding to actin filaments ( ∼ 3 × 10 4 M - 1 s - 1 ) is much slower than the association rate constants of other actin binding proteins ( De La Cruz & Pollard , 1994 ; Allen & Janmey , 1994 ) . For example , the association rate constants of myosin subfragment - 1 ( Blanchoin et al . , 1996 ) , gelsolin ( Allen & Janmey , 1994 ) , filamin ( Goldman & Isenberg , 1993 ) , and R - actinin ( Kuhlman et al . , 1994 ) are all ∼ 10 6 - 10 7 M - 1 s - 1 . The slow association rate constant of rhodamine phalloidin suggests that not all of the phalloidin binding sites on a filament are readily available but become accessible as the filament experiences thermal fluctuations in shape , or “breathes” ( De La Cruz & Pollard , 1994 ) . We have compared the kinetics and thermodynamics of rhodamine phalloidin binding to actin filaments from three divergent species : New Zealand white rabbits , Acan - thamoeba castellanii , and Saccharomyces cere V isiae . In each case , binding is driven by a large entropy change . A single amino acid substitution in the phalloidin binding site of the yeast actin may explain its lower affinity for rhodamine phalloidin . The effects of salt , pH , and viscosity demonstrate the importance of actin filament dynamics for phalloidin binding . In addition , we present the kinetic and equilibrium constants for phalloidin binding to rabbit muscle actin filaments . MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents .

The concentrations of phalloidin stock solutions were determined by absorbance using (cid:15) 300 ) 1 . 07 × 10 4 M - 1 cm - 1 for phalloidin in water ( Miyamoto et al . , 1986 ) and (cid:15) 540 ) 7 . 25 × 10 4 M - 1 cm - 1 for rhodamine phalloidin in methanol ( Molecular Probes ) . Actin Purification and Modification . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified by the method of Spudich and Watt ( 1971 ) . A . castellanii actin was purified according to Pollard ( 1984 ) . The final step in both preparations was gel filtration on Sephadex G - 150 or Sephacryl S - 300 equilibrated in buffer A [ 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM NaN 3 , and 2 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) ] at 4 (cid:176) C ( MacLean - Fletcher & Pollard , 1980 ) . Skeletal muscle and Acan - thamoeba actin concentrations were determined by absor - bance at 290 nm using (cid:15) ) 2 . 66 × 10 4 M - 1 cm - 1 ( Houk & Ue , 1974 ) . S . cere V isiae actin was purified by the method of Cook and Rubenstein ( 1992 ) . Briefly , ∼ 80 g of a pressed yeast cake ( kindly provided by Dr . Carl Frieden of Washington University School of Medicine , St . Louis ) was disrupted with glass beads ( 425 - 600 µ m , acid - washed ) in a Dyno - Mill Model KDL bead mill ( Glen Mills Inc . , Clifton , NJ ) at 4 (cid:176) C in ∼ 150 mL of buffer A ¢ ( buffer A with the pH adjusted to 7 . 5 ) free of DTT and azide and supplemented with protease inhibitors ( 1 µ g / mL aprotinin , antipain , leupeptin , pepstatin A , chymostatin , 2 µ g / mL soybean bovine trypsin inhibitor , and 0 . 3 mM PMSF ) . The lysate was passed through three layers of cheese cloth to remove the glass beads and centrifuged at 128000 g for 45 min . The supernatant was applied to a DNase 1 column equilibrated in buffer A ¢ . Actin was eluted with 50 % formamide / 1X buffer A and applied directly to a 2 . 5 mL DEAE - DE52 column . Actin was eluted from the DEAE with 0 . 3 M KCl / 1X buffer A . Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer A , polymerized with 2 mM MgCl 2 and 50 mM KCl , and then pelleted at 208000 g . The actin pellet was dialyzed against buffer A for 2 days , and actin oligomers were removed by centrifugation . Actin was stored on ice and used within 10 days . Purified actin migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼ 43000 Da as determined by SDS - PAGE . The concentration was determined by BCA protein assay ( Pierce ) using Acanthamoeba actin as a standard . Mg 2 + - actin was made by adding 200 µ M EGTA and 80 µ M MgCl 2 to Ca 2 + - actin in buffer A essentially as described ( Gershman et al . , 1989 ; Kinosian et al . , 1991 ) . Actin was polymerized by adding 0 . 1 volume of 10X KMEI [ 500 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA , and 100 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 0 ) ] to Mg 2 + - actin to generate a stock solution of actin filaments in 1X polymerizing buffer . Determination of the Critical Concentration . The critical concentration for assembly was measured by 90 (cid:176) light scattering ( λ ex and λ em ) 400 nm ) at 22 (cid:176) C in 1X polymerizing buffer after diluting a stock polymer solution to the indicated actin concentrations , sonicating briefly in a bath sonicator , and equilibrating at 22 (cid:176) C for 4 h . Under our experimental conditions S . cere V isiae actin has a critical concentration of 0 . 15 µ M ( data not shown ) . Rabbit skeletal muscle and Acanthamoeba actin have critical concentrations of 0 . 1 µ M . Rhodamine Phalloidin Binding Kinetics . The observed rate constant ( k obs ) for rhodamine phalloidin binding to actin filaments was determined by measuring the time course of fluorescence intensity increase ( λ ex ) 550 nm , λ em ) 575 nm ) after mixing equal volumes of 20 - 40 nM rhodamine phalloidin with varying concentrations of Mg 2 + - F - actin each in 1X polymerizing buffer ( De La Cruz & Pollard , 1994 ) . The dissociation rate constant of the rhodamine phalloidin - actin complex ( k - RhPh ) was determined by displacing bound rhodamine phalloidin with excess unlabeled phalloidin ( De La Cruz & Pollard , 1994 ) . The temperature dependence of the rate constants was analyzed according to transition state theory ( Eyring , 1935 ; Fersht , 1984 ) which relates the rate constant of a reaction to an equilibrium constant between the reactants and the transition state , a transient high - energy species that decays to form product . The free energy of activation ( ∆ G q ) for formation of the transition state is related to the rate constant ( k ) of a reaction by where h is Planck’s constant , k B is Boltzmann’s constant , R is the gas constant , and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin . The transmission coefficient ( Eyring , 1935 ) is assumed to be unity ( Fersht , 1984 ) and can be ignored . The free energy of activation can be expanded into its enthalpic ( ∆ H q ) and entropic ( ∆ S q ) components to yield the equation Rearranging , we obtain The enthalpy of activation ( ∆ H q ) is obtained from the slope of the line generated by plotting the left - hand side of the equation versus the inverse absolute temperature . The intercept yields the entropy of activation ( ∆ S q ) , but it is not an accurate determination due to the long extrapolation beyond the range of the data . The activation entropy ( ∆ S q ) at a given temperature is determined from Isothermal Titration Calorimetry ( ITC ) . The enthalpy change ( ∆ H (cid:176) ) associated with phalloidin binding was measured directly with an Omega titration calorimeter ( MicroCal , Inc . ) . A single aliquot of a concentrated rhodamine phalloidin solution was injected into a solution of 5 µ M actin filaments so that all sites would be occupied upon equilibra - tion . A second injection served to correct for nonspecific heats arising from mixing . Both phalloidin and actin were in 1X polymerizing buffer , and the temperature was 25 (cid:176) C . Data analysis was done with software accompanying the instrument as instructed by the manufacturer ( MicroCal Software , Inc . ) . Sol V ent Manipulations . The pH was adjusted with MES for pH 5 . 90 - 6 . 50 , imidazole for pH 6 . 90 - 7 . 35 , or Tris for pH 7 . 85 - 8 . 34 . The ionic strength was adjusted with KCl in the rhodamine phalloidin syringe ( for k + determinations ) or by diluting a concentrated aliquot of actin - rhodamine ∆ G q ) - RT ln ( kh k B T ) ( 1 ) ∆ H q - T ∆ S q ) - RT ln ( kh k B T ) ( 2 ) ln ( kh k B T ) ) ( - ∆ H q R ) ( 1 T ) + ∆ S q R ( 3 ) ∆ S q ) ∆ H q - ∆ G q T ( 4 ) Phalloidin Binding to Actin Biochemistry , Vol . 35 , No . 45 , 1996 14055 + + + + phalloidin in 1X polymerizing buffer into the desired buffer conditions ( for k - determinations ) . Viscosities and osmotic pressures of sucrose and methylcellulose solutions were obtained from published values ( Anderson , 1970 ; Wolf , 1986 ) or from the manufacturer . Phalloidin Binding Kinetics and Affinity . The association rate constant of phalloidin binding to actin ( k + Ph ) was determined at 22 (cid:176) C from the dependence of k obs on the phalloidin concentration ( 0 . 23 - 2 . 28 µ M ) at constant rhodamine phalloidin ( 1 . 8 µ M ) and actin filament ( 0 . 45 µ M ) concentrations . In the case of phalloidin and rhodamine phalloidin competing for a limited number of sites on an actin filament , Therefore , k + Ph is obtained from the slope of the line generated from plotting k obs versus phalloidin concentration . The intercept yields k + RhPh [ RhPh ] . The dissociation rate constants of both phalloidin derivatives are slow enough that they will not contribute significantly to k obs and can be ignored . The dissociation rate constant of phalloidin ( k - Ph ) was determined from the rate of fluorescence enhancement when 7 . 2 µ M rhodamine phalloidin was added to a sample of 1 . 0 µ M actin filaments equilibrated with 1 molar equiv of phalloidin in 1X polymerizing buffer at 22 (cid:176) C . The rate - limiting step under these conditions is the dissociation of bound phalloidin . Therefore , the rate of fluorescence enhancement arising from rhodamine phalloidin binding gives the dissociation rate constant of the initially bound phalloidin . The affinity of phalloidin for actin was estimated from the ratio of the rate constants and from the reduction in equilibrium fluorescence of rhodamine phalloidin and actin over a range of phalloidin concentrations using the relation where K Ph and K RhPh are the association equilibrium constants for phalloidin and rhodamine phalloidin , respectively , [ RhPh ] is the rhodamine phalloidin concentration , and [ Ph ] 0 . 5 is the concentration of phalloidin which results in a 50 % displace - ment of the initially bound rhodamine phalloidin ( Huang et al . , 1992 ) . Nucleotide Exchange Kinetics . The dissociation rate constant of Mg 2 + - ATP from actin ( k - MgATP ) was measured from the fluorescence increase when 0 . 8 - 1 . 9 µ M Mg 2 + - ATP - actin was added to 200 µ M (cid:15) ATP in 20 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) and 1 mM MgCl 2 buffer at 22 (cid:176) C ( De La Cruz & Pollard , 1995 ) . Free ATP was removed from ATP - actin with Dowex 1 . The dissociation rate constant of ATP from Ca 2 + - ATP - actin ( k - CaATP ) was determined under similar conditions except MgCl 2 was replaced with 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 . The time course of fluorescence increase due to (cid:15) ATP binding was fitted with a nonlinear curve - fitting program . Frieden and Patane ( 1988 ) observed a greater k - ATP as the ATP concentration was increased . We did not observe a dependence of k - MgATP on the free (cid:15) ATP concentration under our experimental conditions of high divalent cation concen - tration and pH ( data not shown ) . RESULTS ( a ) Rate Constant for Rhodamine Phalloidin Association with Actin Filaments . The time course of the fluorescence enhancement after mixing rhodamine phalloidin with S . cere V isiae actin filaments fits a single exponential ( Figure 1A ) , like Acanthamoeba ( Figure 1A ) and rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( not shown ) . The observed rate constants , k obs , depend linearly on the concentrations of actin filaments for all three actins ( Figure 1B ) . The slopes of the lines yield association rate constants for rhodamine phalloidin binding ( k + RhPh ) of 5 . 1 ( ( 0 . 2 ) × 10 4 M - 1 s - 1 for S . cere V isiae actin filaments and 3 . 4 ( ( 0 . 3 ) × 10 4 M - 1 s - 1 for Acanthamoeba actin filaments at 22 (cid:176) C . The k + RhPh for rabbit skeletal muscle actin , 2 . 9 ( ( 0 . 2 ) × 10 4 M - 1 s - 1 , confirms previous deter - minations of 2 . 8 × 10 4 M - 1 s - 1 ( De La Cruz & Pollard , 1994 ) and 3 × 10 4 M - 1 s - 1 ( Allen & Janmey , 1994 ) . Partial saturation of filaments with one phalloidin per four actin subunits is reported ( Orlova et al . , 1995 ) to alter the conformation of the filaments , but this has no effect on the association rate constant for rhodamine phalloidin and rabbit actin filaments ( data not shown ) . ( b ) Rate Constant for Rhodamine Phalloidin Dissociation from Actin Filaments . The dissociation rate constant of rhodamine phalloidin ( k - RhPh ) was obtained by adding excess phalloidin to a sample of actin filaments equilibrated with rhodamine phalloidin ( Figure 2 ) . At 22 (cid:176) C , rhodamine phalloidin dissociates with a rate constant of 0 . 0016 ( ( 0 . 0002 ) k obs ) k + Ph [ Ph ] + k + RhPh [ RhPh ] ( 5 ) K Ph ) 1 + K RhPh [ RhPh ] [ Ph ] 0 . 5 ( 6 ) F IGURE 1 : Kinetics of rhodamine phalloidin binding to actin filaments .

The dissociation rate constant from rabbit skeletal muscle actin filaments , 0 . 00026 s - 1 ( n ) 2 ) , agreed with published values ( Allen & Janmey , 1994 ; De La Cruz & Pollard , 1994 ) . From the ratio of the rate constants , we calculate dissociation equilibrium constants ( K d ) of 32 ( ( 4 ) nM for S . cere V isiae actin , 5 ( ( 1 ) nM for Acanthamoeba actin , and 9 ( ( 2 ) nM for rabbit skeletal muscle actin . ( c ) Thermodynamics of Rhodamine Phalloidin Binding . Eyring plots of the dependence of k + on the temperature for Acanthamoeba and rabbit skeletal muscle actin are linear over the temperature range examined and have identical slopes ( Figure 3A ) , yielding activation enthalpies ( ∆ H q ) of ∼ 2 . 3 kcal mol - 1 ( Table 1 ) . The Eyring plot for S . cere V isiae actin is linear over a wide range of temperatures but changes slope at ∼ 12 (cid:176) C ( Figure 3A ) . At temperatures of > 12 (cid:176) C , the activation enthalpy ( ∆ H q ) is 3 . 4 ( 0 . 1 kcal mol - 1 . Eyring plots of temperature dependence of k - for all three actins are linear over the range examined ( Figure 3B ) . The activation enthalpies ( ∆ H q ) for dissociation of rhodamine phalloidin are 4 . 9 ( 0 . 4 kcal mol - 1 for S . cere V isiae actin filaments , 3 . 9 ( 0 . 2 kcal mol - 1 for Acanthamoeba actin filaments , and 4 . 5 ( 0 . 3 kcal mol - 1 for rabbit skeletal muscle actin filaments . By calorimetry , the ∆ H (cid:176) associated with rhodamine phalloidin binding to rabbit actin is - 2 . 9 kcal mol - 1 ( Table 1 ) . This value agrees closely with the ∆ H (cid:176) estimated from the difference in association and dissociation activation enthalpies ( see Table 1 footnotes ) , consistent with a simple bimolecular mechanism for rhodamine phalloidin binding ( De La Cruz & Pollard , 1994 ; Allen & Janmey , 1994 ) . Table 1 summarizes all the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the binding of rhodamine phalloidin and actin filaments . ( d ) Effects of pH , Ionic Strength , Viscosity , Filament Length , and Sol V ent Isotope on the Binding of Rhodamine Phalloidin and Muscle Actin . The association rate constant for rhodamine phalloidin binding to rabbit actin filaments is independent of pH over the range of pH 5 . 90 - 8 . 34 ( data not shown ) and ionic strength over the range of 50 - 500 mM KCl in the presence of 1 mM MgCl 2 ( data not shown ) . Similarly , the dissociation rate constant for rhodamine phalloidin is unaffected by the absence of KCl or both KCl and MgCl 2 in 1X polymerizing buffer ( data not shown ) . Shortening the length of the filaments with Cap Z ( one per 233 actin subunits ) , the skeletal muscle capping protein ( donated by Dr . J . F . Casella ) , does not affect the association rate ( data not shown ) . Raising the solvent macroviscosity with methylcellulose ( 1 - 177 cp ) has no significant effect on the association kinetics of rhodamine phalloidin and actin ( data not shown ) . However , increasing the microviscosity with sucrose slows both association and dissociation of rhodamine phalloidin ( panels A and B of Figure 4 ) with no net effect on the equilibrium binding affinity ( Figure 4C ) . The association rate constant is not significantly different in water and 65 % D 2 O ( data not shown ) . F IGURE 2 : Time course of rhodamine phalloidin dissociation from actin filaments . Rhodamine phalloidin ( 10 nM ) was equilibrated with 1 . 25 µ M S . cere V isiae ( left ) or 1 . 9 µ M Acanthamoeba ( right ) actin filaments for 2 h in 1X polymerizing buffer at 22 (cid:176) C , and the fluorescence intensity was monitored upon addition of 40 µ M phalloidin . Only the first 6000 s of the Acanthamoeba time course is shown . The solid lines are the best fits to single exponentials . The dissociation rate constants are 1 . 6 ( ( 0 . 2 ) × 10 - 3 s - 1 ( n ) 5 ) for S . cere V isiae actin , 1 . 7 ( ( 0 . 2 ) × 10 - 4 s - 1 ( n ) 3 ) for Acanthamoeba actin , and 2 . 6 × 10 - 4 s - 1 ( n ) 2 ) for rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( not shown ) . F IGURE 3 : Temperature dependence of phalloidin binding kinetics . ( A ) Temperature dependence of the association rate constant of rhodamine phalloidin and actin filaments in 1X polymerizing buffer . The activation enthalpies ( ∆ H q ) obtained from the slopes of the lines are 3 . 4 ( ( 0 . 10 ) kcal mol - 1 for S . cere V isiae actin ( O ) at temperatures of > 12 (cid:176) C , 2 . 3 ( ( 0 . 05 ) kcal mol - 1 for Acanthamoeba actin ( 4 ) , and 2 . 3 ( ( 0 . 04 ) kcal mol - 1 for rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( b ) . Vertical bars represent standard deviation from the mean ( n ) 3 - 6 for yeast ; n ) 5 - 8 for Acanthamoeba ; n ) 5 - 6 for rabbit skeletal muscle ) . ( B ) Temperature dependence of the dissociation rate constant of rhodamine phalloidin from actin filaments in 1X polymerizing buffer . The fluorescence intensity was monitored upon addition of 40 µ M phalloidin to an equilibrated sample of 20 nM rhodamine phalloidin and actin filaments at the indicated temperatures . The activation enthalpies ( ∆ H q ) for dis - sociation of rhodamine phalloidin are 4 . 9 ( ( 0 . 4 ) kcal mol - 1 for S . cere V isiae actin ( O ) , 3 . 9 ( ( 0 . 2 ) kcal mol - 1 for Acanthamoeba actin ( 4 ) , and 4 . 5 ( ( 0 . 3 ) kcal mol - 1 for rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( b ) . Vertical bars represent the standard deviation from the mean ( n ) 3 - 5 for yeast ; n ) 3 for Acanthamoeba ; n ) 3 for rabbit skeletal muscle actin from two different preparations of each ) . Phalloidin Binding to Actin Biochemistry , Vol . 35 , No . 45 , 1996 14057 + + + + ( e ) Phalloidin Binding Kinetics and Affinity . The time course of the fluorescence enhancement after mixing a solution of rhodamine phalloidin and various concentrations of phalloidin with muscle actin filaments fits a single exponential as in Figure 1A ( data not shown ) . The k obs depends linearly on the concentration of phalloidin ( Figure 5A ) . The slope of the line yields an association rate constant ( k + Ph ) of 1 . 7 ( ( 0 . 2 ) × 10 5 M - 1 s - 1 for phalloidin binding to muscle actin filaments at 22 (cid:176) C . The k + RhPh determined from the y - intercept divided by the concentration of rhodamine phalloidin is 2 . 6 ( ( 0 . 7 ) × 10 4 M - 1 s - 1 , in agreement with previous determinations ( Figure 1 ; De La Cruz & Pollard , 1994 ; Allen & Janmey , 1994 ) . The dissociation rate constant of unlabeled phalloidin ( k - Ph ) was obtained by adding excess rhodamine phalloidin to a sample of actin filaments equilibrated with equimolar phalloidin ( Figure 5B ) . Phalloidin dissociates with a rate constant of 0 . 00037 ( ( 0 . 00003 ) s - 1 ( n ) 4 ) from rabbit muscle actin filaments at 22 (cid:176) C . From the ratio of the rate constants , we calculate a dissociation equilibrium constant ( K d ) of 2 . 1 ( ( 0 . 3 ) nM for muscle actin and phalloidin at 22 (cid:176) C . From the reduction in equilibrium fluorescence ( the amplitudes of the transients ) of rhodamine phalloidin ( Figure 5C ) , we calculate a K d of 0 . 5 ( ( 0 . 2 ) nM using eq 6 . This figure is less reliable than the ratio of the k ’s . The temperature dependence of phalloidin binding was not investigated , but calorimetry shows that phalloidin binds actin filaments with a ∆ H (cid:176) of - 13 . 6 ( ( 0 . 7 ) kcal mol - 1 ( n ) 5 ) at pH 7 . 0 . Calorimetric titration with phalloidin shows a strict linear relationship between heat released ( ∆ H (cid:176) ) and bound phalloidin until all sites on the filament are occupied . Therefore , the large negative ∆ H (cid:176) does not arise from the conformational change that occurs after phalloidin binds . The calorimetric ∆ H (cid:176) is independent of buffer ionization enthal - pies , demonstrating that protons are neither released nor bound when phalloidin binds to actin . ( f ) Nucleotide Exchange . The dissociation rate constants of Mg 2 + - ATP ( k - MgATP ) and Ca 2 + - ATP ( k - CaATP ) were measured by displacing bound ATP from Mg 2 + - actin or Ca 2 + - actin monomers with a large molar excess of (cid:15) ATP in 1 mM MgCl 2 or 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , respectively ( data not shown ) . As previously reported by several labs [ summarized in De La Cruz and Pollard ( 1995 ) ] , k - MgATP is greater than k - CaATP for rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( Table 2 ) . The rates of Mg 2 + - ATP and Ca 2 + - ATP dissociation from Acan - thamoeba actin were similar to those of rabbit skeletal muscle actin under the experimental conditions examined ( Table 2 ) . In contrast , k - MgATP and k - CaATP of S . cere V isiae actin are the same ( ∼ 0 . 01 s - 1 ) at pH 8 . 0 and 22 (cid:176) C ( Table 2 ) . Our value for the k - CaATP of S . cere V isiae actin differs by less than a factor of 2 from that of Chen et al . ( 1993 ) obtained by a different method under slightly different buffer condi - tions . Miller et al . ( 1995 ) reported that (cid:15) ATP dissociates more rapidly from yeast actin than rabbit actin but did not examine the divalent cation specificity . DISCUSSION ( a ) Biochemical Differences among Actin Isoforms . The Lorenz et al . ( 1993 ) model of F - actin shows phalloidin interacting with neighboring subunits through both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions . Most of these amino acid residues are identical in all three actin types that we examined ( Ng & Abelson , 1980 ; Gallwitz & Seidel , 1980 ; Vandekerckhove et al . , 1984 ) , including R177 and R179 which are required for binding ( Drubin et al . , 1993 ) . The one exception is residue 201 , which is valine in muscle , serine in S . cere V isiae , and threonine in Acanthamoeba . Thus , within the area of direct contact with phalloidin , substituting threonine for valine has little effect on the affinity while substitution with serine ( S . cere V isiae ) destabilizes the complex significantly . If we consider the actin - phalloidin interface similar to the intramolecular interactions of a globular protein such as staphylococcal nuclease , the effects of these amino acid substitutions can be rationalized . Single substitution muta - tions in staphylococcal nuclease demonstrate that substitution of threonine for valine has little or no effect on the stable , native state , while serine substitutions tend to disrupt intramolecular interactions considerably , resulting in a less stable structure ( Byrne et al . , 1995 ) . Amino acid substitutions far from the binding site may influence the flexibility of the actin filament and the binding Table 1 : Thermodynamic and Kinetic Parameters for Rhodamine Phalloidin Binding to Actin Filaments at 22 (cid:176) C parameter a rabbit skeletal muscle Acanthamoeba S . cere V isiae k + ( M - 1 s - 1 ) 2 . 9 ( ( 0 . 2 ) × 10 4 3 . 4 ( ( 0 . 3 ) × 10 4 5 . 1 ( ( 0 . 2 ) × 10 4 k - ( s - 1 ) 0 . 00026 0 . 00017 ( 0 . 00002 0 . 0016 ( 0 . 0002 K d ( nM ) 9 ( 2 5 ( 1 32 ( 4 ∆ H q a ( kcal mol - 1 ) 2 . 29 ( 0 . 04 b 2 . 33 ( 0 . 05 3 . 40 ( 0 . 10 ∆ G q a ( kcal mol - 1 ) 11 . 2 ( 0 . 02 11 . 2 ( 0 . 03 11 . 0 ( 0 . 05 ∆ S q a ( cal mol - 1 K - 1 - 30 . 2 ( 0 . 2 - 30 . 2 ( 0 . 2 - 25 . 8 ( 0 . 4 T ∆ S q a ( kcal mol - 1 ) - 8 . 9 ( 0 . 1 - 8 . 9 ( 0 . 1 - 7 . 6 ( 0 . 1 ∆ H q d ( kcal mol - 1 ) 4 . 5 ( 0 . 3 3 . 9 ( 0 . 2 4 . 9 ( 0 . 4 ∆ G q d ( kcal mol - 1 ) 22 . 1 22 . 4 ( 0 . 1 21 . 1 ( 0 . 1 ∆ S q d ( cal mol - 1 K - 1 ) - 59 . 7 - 62 . 7 ( 0 . 8 - 54 . 9 ( 1 . 4 T ∆ S q d ( kcal mol - 1 ) - 17 . 6 - 18 . 5 ( 0 . 2 - 16 . 2 ( 0 . 4 ∆ H (cid:176) ( kcal mol - 1 ) c - 2 . 2 ( 0 . 3 - 1 . 6 ( 0 . 2 - 1 . 5 ( 0 . 4 ∆ G (cid:176) ( kcal mol - 1 ) d - 10 . 9 - 11 . 2 ( 0 . 1 - 10 . 1 ( 0 . 1 ∆ S (cid:176) ( cal mol - 1 K - 1 ) e 29 . 5 32 . 5 ( 0 . 8 29 . 1 ( 1 . 5 T ∆ S (cid:176) ( kcal mol - 1 ) 8 . 7 9 . 6 ( 0 . 2 8 . 6 ( 0 . 4 ∆ H (cid:176) ( kcal mol - 1 ) f - 2 . 9 ND g ND a The subscripts a and d refer to the association and dissociation reactions , respectively . b n ) 3 - 5 where standard errors are indicated . c Calculated from ∆ H (cid:176) ) ∆ H q a - ∆ H q d . d Calculated from ∆ G (cid:176) ) ∆ G q a - ∆ G q d ) RT ln K d . e Calculated from ∆ S (cid:176) ) ∆ S q a - ∆ S q d . f Calorimetric determination . g ND ) not determined . 14058 Biochemistry , Vol . 35 , No . 45 , 1996 De La Cruz and Pollard + + + + kinetics of phalloidin . The rigidity of the polymer depends on the number of interactions between the subunits ( Tirion et al . , 1995 ) . S . cere V isiae differs from both muscle and Acanthamoeba at several positions thought to participate in intermolecular bonds in the filament : nine residues ( V43I , L110M , E167A , Y169F , A170S , F266V , M269L , I289V , and T324S ) in the model of Holmes et al . ( 1990 ) and six ( E167A , Y169F , A170S , Q263H , F266V , and M269L ) in the refined F - actin model of Tirion et al . ( 1995 ) . S . cere V isiae actin filaments appear qualitatively less rigid ( Kron et al . , 1992 ) and fragment more easily ( Buzan & Frieden , 1996 ) than rabbit skeletal muscle actin filaments , so these substitutions may allow S . cere V isiae actin filaments to breathe more easily than rabbit skeletal muscle and Acanthamoeba actin fila - ments , allowing phalloidin to associate ( Figure 1 ) and dissociate ( Figure 2 ) more readily . Labeling the S . cere V isiae actin cytoskeleton requires higher concentrations of phallotoxin than staining of animal or protozoan cells ( Szczesna & Lehrer , 1993 ; Wong et al . , 1983 ; Amatruda & Cooper , 1992 ) . The lower affinity of rhodamine phalloidin for yeast actin ( Table 1 ) explains these observations . Novel yeast actin - binding proteins may also interfere with binding of rhodamine phalloidin . Two pre - cedents in animal cells are gelsolin ( Allen & Janmey , 1994 ) and nebulin ( Ao & Lehrer , 1995 ) . Our values for the rate constants for ATP dissociation ( Table 2 ) explain why the affinity of S . cere V isiae actin for F IGURE 4 : Effects of sucrose on rhodamine phalloidin binding kinetics and affinity .

( A ) Phalloidin concentration dependence of the observed rate constant ( k obs ) for the association of rhodamine phalloidin and actin in 1X polymerizing buffer at 22 (cid:176) C . The slope of the line yields an association rate constant for phalloidin binding ( k + Ph ) of 1 . 7 ( ( 0 . 2 ) × 10 5 M - 1 s - 1 . The association rate constant for rhodamine phalloidin binding ( k + RhPh ) estimated from the y - intercept of the line is 2 . 6 ( ( 0 . 7 ) × 10 4 M - 1 s - 1 . Vertical bars are the standard deviation from the mean ( n ) 4 ) . ( B ) Time course of phalloidin dissociation from actin filaments . Phalloidin ( 1 . 0 µ M ) was equilibrated with 1 . 0 µ M actin filaments for 2 h in 1X polymerizing buffer at 22 (cid:176) C , and the fluorescence intensity was monitored upon addition of 7 . 2 µ M rhodamine phalloidin . The solid line is the best fit to a single exponential , yielding a dissociation rate constant of phalloidin ( k - Ph ) of 3 . 7 ( ( 0 . 3 ) × 10 - 4 s - 1 ( n ) 4 ) . ( C ) Dependence of the equilibrium fluorescence of actin and rhodamine phalloidin on the concentration of competing phalloidin . The curve represents the best fit to eq 6 . The dissociation equilibrium constant determined from this analysis is 0 . 5 ( ( 0 . 2 ) nM . The ratio of the rate constants gives a more accurate estimate of the dissociation equilibrium constant of 2 . 1 ( ( 0 . 3 ) nM . Phalloidin Binding to Actin Biochemistry , Vol . 35 , No . 45 , 1996 14059 + + + + Ca 2 + - ATP is ∼ 3 - fold weaker than that of rabbit skeletal muscle actin and the same as the affinities of both actins for Mg 2 + - ATP ( Chen et al . , 1995 ) . The dissociation rate constants of the metal - nucleotide complexes determine the different binding affinities and not the association rate constants ( De La Cruz & Pollard , 1995 ) . The amino acids in contact with ATP are the same in all three actins , so the greater k - CaATP of S . cere V isiae actin must result from changes outside the nucleotide binding region . Residues 137 - 144 form an R - helix suggested to provide a hinge for subdomain motions ( Tirion & ben - Avraham , 1993 ; Holmes et al . , 1993 ) . A substitution in this helix ( Ala144 in rabbits and Acanthamoeba , Ser144 in S . cere V isiae ) may contribute to the unique nucleotide exchange behavior of yeast actin . ( b ) Energetics of Phalloidin Binding . A simple bimo - lecular association reaction can describe the binding of rhodamine phalloidin to actin filaments ( De La Cruz & Pollard , 1994 ; Allen & Janmey , 1994 ) : The temperature dependence of the rate constants ( Figure 3A , B ) indicates that there is a small enthalpic difference ( ∆ H q ) between the reactants and the transition state for both the association and dissociation reactions ( Table 1 ) . At equilibrium , the net change in enthalpy between the free and bound states ( ∆ H (cid:176) ) is also very small ( Table 1 ) . Conse - quently , the free energies of rhodamine phalloidin binding ( ∆ G q and ∆ G (cid:176) ) are dominated by entropic changes ( ∆ S q and ∆ S (cid:176) ) . It is difficult to assign precisely the factors that contribute to the entropy changes , which may include contributions from the solvent , phalloidin , and actin . How - ever , given the extent of hydrophobic interactions in the proposed phalloidin binding site ( Lorenz et al . , 1993 ) , it seems likely that the positive ∆ S (cid:176) arises from changes in the solvent , perhaps due to disruption of ordered water molecules on actin and phalloidin . In addition , phalloidin increases the torsional flexibility of actin filaments ( Prochniewicz et al . , 1996 ) which will also contribute to a positive ∆ S (cid:176) . Actin binds phalloidin and rhodamine phalloidin differ - ently . The association rate constant of phalloidin ( Figure 5A ) is greater than it is for rhodamine phalloidin ( Figure 1 ) . The dissociation rate constants of the two analogs are similar ( Figures 2 and 5B ) . Consequently , the affinity of actin for phalloidin is about 5 - fold greater than for rhodamine phal - loidin ( Huang et al . , 1992 ) . The equilibrium binding affinity of ∼ 2 . 1 nM yields a free energy ( ∆ G q ) for phalloidin binding of about - 11 . 7 kcal mol - 1 . The ∆ H (cid:176) is more favorable for phalloidin binding than for rhodamine phalloidin ( - 13 . 6 kcal mol - 1 for phalloidin versus - 2 . 9 kcal mol - 1 for rhodamine phalloidin at pH 7 . 0 ) ! The big difference in the ∆ H (cid:176) may be due to specific bond formation that is precluded by the associated fluorophore . Although substoichiometric phalloidin binding is reported to induce a long range change in the electron microscopic structure of actin filaments ( Orlova et al . , 1995 ) , this conformational change does not affect the ∆ H (cid:176) for phalloidin binding . By calorimetry , there is a strict linear dependence of the heat released ( ∆ H (cid:176) ) on bound phalloidin until all phalloidin binding sites on the filament are occupied . With a ∆ H (cid:176) of - 13 . 6 kcal mol - 1 , the ∆ S (cid:176) for phalloidin binding must be negative in contrast to the positive ∆ S (cid:176) of rhodamine phalloidin ( Table 1 ) . A negative ∆ S (cid:176) for phalloidin binding has been reported ( Le Bihan & Gicquaud , 1991 ) and may result from interactions of phalloidin - labeled filaments with the solvent ( Cuneo et al . , 1995 ) . ( c ) Why Is Rhodamine Phalloidin Binding to Actin Filaments So Slow ? The association rate constant of rhodamine phalloidin binding to actin filaments ( ∼ 10 4 M - 1 s - 1 ) is extremely low for the bimolecular association of a peptide and macromolecule [ see De La Cruz and Pollard ( 1994 ) ] . The small association rate constant suggested a model where the phalloidin binding sites on an actin filament are not readily exposed but become accessible as the filament experiences thermal fluctuations in shape , or breathes ( De La Cruz & Pollard , 1994 ) . In this model , binding is limited by the accessibility of the sites . We can eliminate other factors that decrease the association rates of other molecules , including electrostatic repulsion , slow protonation reactions , and slow rearrangement of water molecules ( Ferscht , 1984 ; Bartlett & Marlowe , 1987 ) . The association rate of rhodamine phalloidin is independent of the ionic strength ( 50 - 500 mM KCl ) and pH ( 5 . 90 - 8 . 34 ) , suggesting that neither is responsible for the slow binding kinetics . Since osmotic stress ( Rand et al . , 1993 ; Parsegian et al . , 1995 ) does not affect the affinity of actin and rhodamine phalloidin ( Figure 4C ) , and 65 % D 2 O does not generate a solvent isotope effect on the association reaction ( data not shown ) , we can exclude hydration / dehydration as the rate - limiting step for binding . It is important to stress that this does not mean that rearrangement of water molecules does not occur when rhodamine phalloidin binds , simply that it does not limit the rate of the reactions . We suggest that sucrose reduces the rates of rhodamine phalloidin binding and dissociation without a change in the binding affinity by suppressing actin filament dynamics . Suppressed breathing would inhibit both association and dissociation . The effect is not due to changes in the chemical potential of the reactants since sucrose does not change the binding affinity ( Figure 4C ) . Sucrose must therefore dampen some kinetic process . Solvent microviscosity restricts the structural dynamics and conformational flexibility of proteins ( Gavish & Werber , 1979 ; Somogyi et al . , 1988 ; Priev et al . , 1995 ) and limits the accessibility of phalloidin binding sites . The association rate constant for phalloidin is ∼ 6 - fold greater than that for rhodamine phalloidin ( Figure 5A ) , so the fluorophore slows binding significantly . The effect is less dramatic for dissociation ( Figure 5B ) .

Although phalloidin binds actin filaments more rapidly than rhodamine phalloidin , its binding is still much slower than the binding of other proteins , suggesting that filament breathing limits the rate of phalloidin binding .
