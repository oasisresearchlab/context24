These proteins are regulated by several factors , including phosphorylation , pH and mechanical forces . Although the cofilin - decorated actin filament structure was published recently , the mechanisms of these regulating factors remain unclear . Models that describe regulation based on the latest structural data and research will be discussed . Aspects about the interaction between actin and cofilin that require further investigation are also discussed . Keywords Actin · Cofilin · Regulation · Phosphorylation · Mechanical force Introduction The actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilins disassem - ble the actin filament and accelerate actin turnover ( Car - lier et al . 1997 ; Pollard and Borisy 2003 ) . ADF / cofilins are expressed in all eukaryotes ( Ono 2007 ) and contribute directly to motile structures such as lamellipodia ( Pollard and Borisy 2003 ) , filopodia ( Fass et al . 2004 ) , neural growth cones ( Dumpich et al . 2015 ) and comet tails ( Loisel et al . 1999 ) . ADF / cofilins are also indispensable for maintaining contractile systems , including contractile rings ( Nakano and Mabuchi 2006 ) , stress fibers ( Tojkander et al . 2012 ) and muscles ( Kremneva et al . 2014 ) , by regulating actin filament quantity , length or both . ADF / cofilins are regulated by several factors , includ - ing pH ( Bernstein et al . 2000 ) , phosphorylation of Ser3 , mechanical forces and other proteins such as cyclase - asso - ciated protein 1 ( Zhou et al . 2014 ) and Actin interacting protein 1 ( Nomura et al . 2016 ) . The function of cofilin on the actin filament is largely pH - dependent . At low pH values of 6 – 7 cofilin binds stably to the actin filament , whereas cofilin disassemble the actin filament efficiently at pH values higher than ~ 8 ( Yeoh et al . 2002 ; Yonezawa et al . 1985 ) . Phosphorylation of cofilin Ser3 inhibits cofilin binding to the actin filament ( Abe et al . 1996 ; Elam et al . 2017 ; Nagaoka et al . 1996 ) ; however , how phosphorylation inhibits binding remains unclear . Mechanical regulation is also important . Cofilin cannot bind to a stretched actin filament ( Hayakawa et al . 2011 ) . Recently , it was reported that rotational force exerted by formin also inhibits cofilin binding . Here , actin twist fluc - tuation differed significantly because of the rotational force generated by formin and this difference is considered to be responsible for inhibiting cofilin binding ( Mizuno et al . 2018 ) . Myosin binding also showed a similar effect on cofi - lin binding ( Ngo et al . 2016 ) . These mechanical regula - tions differ from standard protein regulation processes such as phosphorylation , ligand binding or genetic regulation because they can propagate several micrometers along the actin filament instantly in a cell , and their action is much faster than these other types of regulations . Recently we reported a 3 . 8 Å structure of a cofilin - deco - rated actin filament ( cofilactin ) ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ) . Based on this map , we proposed models to explain several features of actin - cofilin interactions , including how cofilin binds to the actin filament , how cofilin makes a cluster on the actin filament , how the ADP - actin subunit is favored for bind - ing and how cofilin severs the actin filament at the pointed end side boundary of the cofilin binding cluster on the actin filament . However , many features remain unexplained . In this review , regulation of cofilin by phosphorylation , pH and mechanical forces will be presented . Although it is difficult to explain these regulatory forces using the current structure ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ) , some important information can be * Akihiro Narita narita . akihiro @ f . mbox . nagoya - u . ac . jp 1 Structural Biology Research Center , Graduate School of Science , Nagoya University , Furo - cho , Chikusa - ku , Nagoya 464 - 8601 , Japan 142 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 141 – 151 1 3 extracted from the structure . We also discuss some contro - versial issues about cofilin function , which require further investigation . Intermolecular interactions in cofilactin Intermolecular interactions in the actin filament and cofi - lactin are described briefly ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ) . The actin molecule consists of the inner domain ( ID ) and the outer domain ( OD ) . The outer domain is divided into two sub - domains , 1 ( SD1 ) and 2 ( SD2 ) ( Fig . 1a ) . In monomeric actin ( G - actin ) , the OD and ID are tilted with respect to Fig . 1 Interactions in the actin filament and cofilactin . The P - end is at the top . a Ribbon models of two actin subunits in the same strand of the actin filament ( PDB ID : 5JLF , cyan ) . The actin molecule has two domains , the inner domain ( ID , green ellipse ) and outer domain ( OD , purple ellipse ) . Each domain is divided into two subdomains , OD into subdomains ( SDs ) 1 and 2 , and ID into 3 and 4 . SD1 and SD2 are indicated by orange and cyan ellipses , respectively . Intrastrand actin – actin interactions can be divided into two types , ID – ID interac - tions ( blue arrow ) and ID – OD interactions ( red arrow ) . The D - loop is presented in magenta .

ID – ID interactions ( blue arrow ) remain but ID – OD interactions are no longer observed . Ser3 of cofilin is shown as a space - filling model . The F - site ( cofilin - B - subunit interface ) , Go site ( cofilin - SD1 of the P - subunit interface ) , Gi _ l site ( cofilin - ID of the P - subunit interface with long - range interactions ) and Gi _ s - sites ( cofilin - ID of the P - sub - unit interface that is not included in the Gi _ l site ) in the actin subu - nits are shown in blue , red , brown and yellow , respectively . In cofilin , residues forming the F - and G - sites are represented in blue and green , respectively . d Schematic diagram of interactions in cofilactin .

Actin forms a double - stranded helical filament ( Holmes et al . 1990 ) . The OD rotates and the molecule is flattened upon polymerization ( F - form , Oda et al . 2009 ; Tanaka et al . 2018 ) . In the actin filament , intrastrand interactions are stronger than interstrand interactions ( Oda et al . 2009 ) . The intrastrand interactions in F - actin are divided into two categories : the ID – ID interaction between adjacent subunits and the specific interaction between the OD of the lower barbed end subunit ( B - subunit ) and the ID of the upper pointed end subunit ( P - subunit ) ( Fig . 1a , b ) ( Oda et al . 2009 ; von der Ecken et al . 2015 ) . Upon cofilin binding , the actin subunit becomes the “C - form” , which is different from either the F - or G - form , and the OD – ID interaction is lost ( Fig . 1c , d ) . Actin - cofilin interactions can be divided into three categories : “F - site” , “Gi - site” and “Go - site” ( Fig . 1c , d ) . The F - site is the interface between the bound cofilin and the B - subunit . The G - site consists of the interface between the bound cofilin and the P - subunit . The G - site can be divided into two parts : the first , named the Gi - site , is located mainly on the ID ( yellow and brown in Fig . 1c , d ) , and the sec - ond , named the Go - site , is located mainly on the SD1 ( red in Fig . 1c , d ) . The innermost area of the Gi - site ( brown in Fig . 1c , d ) named the “Gi _ l - site” , consists of four salt bridges or hydrogen bonds formed by extended side chains with a distance of over 10 Å between the Cαs of each pair con - tributing to this interaction . The other part of the Gi - site is termed the “Gi _ s - site” . Phosphorylation Phosphorylation of cofilin Ser3 deactivates cofilin function and this is a major regulatory mechanism of cofilin in cells ( Kanellos and Frame 2016 ) . The effects of phosphorylation have been investigated by using the phosphorylation mim - icking S3D cofilin mutant ( Elam et al . 2017 ; Nagaoka et al . 1996 ; Pope et al . 2004 ) . The S3D mutation affects the actin - cofilin interaction in two ways . One is a large reduction in binding affinity toward the actin filament ( Elam et al . 2017 ; Nagaoka et al . 1996 ) . The second is a reduction in the sever - ing efficiency ( Elam et al . 2017 ) . S3D cofilin binding to the actin filament when the concentration of the S3D cofilin is high rarely caused severing of the filament . Affinity reduction by phosphorylation The reduced binding affinity caused by phosphorylation of Ser3 may be simply described by the bound phosphate group impairing or blocking interactions between cofilin and the actin filament , either by steric hindrance or by electrostatic repulsion with negative charges on actin because cofilin Ser3 is located at the interface between cofilin and actin ( Fig . 1c ) . We could clearly observe density due to Ser3 in a previous report ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ) . Moreover , cofilin residues 1 – 2 extend away from the interface ( Fig . 2b ) judging from weak and fragmented densities indicating that these two residues are disordered ; although , the densities are not assignable to these residues with certainty ( Fig . 2a ) . Judging from the current structure , simple steric or repulsion models are not plausible . In the vicinity of Ser3 , there is sufficient space to accommodate the attachment of a phosphate group to Ser3 . Fig . 2 a A close - up view of the cryo - EM map and the cofilactin model around the N - terminus of cofilin with a low density contour . With this contour we observed weak densities that may originate from residues 1 and 2 of cofilin . b A close - up view of cofilin Ser3 with putative cofilin residues 1 and 2 . Actin is represented as a van der Waals surface with acidic , basic and polar residues in red , blue and green , respectively . The N - terminus of cofilin is represented in sticks in association with a virtual phosphate group bound to Ser3 , which is indicated in mesh as a van der Waals surface . Around Ser3 there is sufficient space to accommodate a phosphate group but no basic or acidic residues are in the near vicinity 144 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 141 – 151 1 3 In addition , no acidic side chain is found in the vicinity of Ser3 ( Fig . 2b ) . Therefore , phosphorylated cofilin can bind to the actin filament in the same manner as non - phosphorylated active cofilin . This observation is consistent with previous cryo - electron microscopy ( EM ) results at 8 Å resolution ( Elam et al . 2017 ) . The cryo - EM results showed that the actin filament decorated by phosphorylation mimicking mutant S3D cofilin was identical to the wild - type cofilactin at this resolution , indicating that S3D cofilin can bind to the actin filament in the same manner as the wild - type protein . The net charge of actin is negative . Therefore , phospho - rylation of cofilin reduces the attractive electrostatic force between cofilin and actin . However , the reduction in affinity because of phosphorylation is very large ( Elam et al . 2017 ; Nagaoka et al . 1996 ) and unlikely to be solely because of a change in the net charge influencing electrostatic attraction between the two proteins . The N - terminus of cofilin appears to be flexible and molecular dynamics simulations ( MD ) revealed that this terminus is really flexible ( Fig . 3a ) . Therefore , phosphoryl - ated Ser3 might bind to positively charged residues located in the main fold of cofilin . We performed 10 independent short MD runs of phosphorylated cofilin . Six of the 10 runs showed that phosphorylated Ser3 forms a salt bridge with Lys126 ( Fig . 3b ) . This salt bridge may disturb the actin - cofi - lin interface and contribute to the reduced affinity because it restricts the conformation of the N - terminal region , which is part of the actin - cofilin interface . The auto - inhibition mechanism , in which conformational changes to cofilin reduce the affinity toward the actin fila - ment , is supported by previous NMR results ( Pope et al . 2004 ) . The S3D cofilin mutation was found to affect the chemical shift of many signals in the NMR spectrum ( Pope et al . 2004 ) , indicating the mutation caused a conformational change to cofilin . Moreover , not all changes in chemical shifts observed by NMR are explained by the formation of the single salt bridge observed in the MD simulations ( Lys126 - phosphorylated Ser3 ) , and the change in the chemi - cal shift for the resonance arising from Lys126 was very small . Thus , larger structural changes are induced by the phosphorylation mimicking mutation in the cofilin structure . Careful investigation of cofilin structural changes caused by phosphorylation is required . An atomic resolution structure of S3D cofilin is crucial for understanding the reduced affin - ity caused by phosphorylation . Reduced severing efficiency caused by phosphorylation Elam et al . ( 2017 ) reported that the phosphorylation - mim - icking mutant S3D cofilin does not sever filaments efficiently even when this mutant binds to the actin filament at high concentrations of cofilin ( Elam et al . 2017 ) . Results from this report also revealed that cooperative binding of the S3D cofilin mutant to the actin filament is much larger than wild - type cofilin . This large cooperativity effect reduces the number of cofilin cluster boundaries on the actin filament . Because severing occurs at the pointed end side boundary of the cofilin - binding cluster ( Gressin et al . 2015 ; Tanaka et al . 2018 ; Wioland et al . 2017 ) , the large cooperativity observed explains why the mutant cofilin does not sever the actin fil - ament . However , explaining this cooperativity is difficult using the cofilactin structure because the S3D mutant binds to the actin filament in a very similar manner to wild - type cofilin ( Elam et al . 2017 ) .

( Color figure online ) 145 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 141 – 151 1 3 is important for explaining the observed reduced severing efficiency as well as explaining the reduced affinity . Cofilin regulation by pH The function of cofilin on the actin filament is largely dependent on pH . At lower pH values of 6 – 7 , cofilin binds stably to the actin filament . At pH values of ~ 8 , cofilin disas - sembles the actin filament more efficiently ( Yeoh et al . 2002 ; Yonezawa et al . 1985 ) . The protonation state of histidines is most likely responsible for the functional change over this pH range . However , no histidine is present at the interface between cofilin and actin ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ) . Thus , it is difficult to explain the pH - dependent activity of cofilin with the current cofilactin model . Therefore , it is plausible that differences inside cofilin or inside the actin filament , induced by changes in the protonation state of histidines at particular pH values , are responsible for changes in the activity of cofi - lin . Pope et al . ( 2004 ) proposed that a salt bridge between His133 and Asp98 in human cofilin is responsible for the pH - dependent regulation of cofilin ( Pope et al . 2004 ) . NMR signals arising from residues 96 – 98 , which are involved in this potential interaction with His133 , showed large chemi - cal shift changes as a function of pH . The actin filament features are also dependent on pH . A lower pH leads to a smaller critical concentration and faster polymerization ( Wang et al . 1989 ; Zimmerle and Frieden 1988 ) . A larger critical concentration at high pH , which is equivalent to a reduction in actin filament stability , might promote disas - semble of the actin filament by cofilin . Very recently , it was reported that the cofilin cluster growth is faster at lower pH ( Wioland et al . 2019a ) . Faster growth of the cluster will reduce the boundary number of the cofilin cluster and contribute to a reduced severing rate ; however , the structural basis for faster growth is unclear . Mechanical regulation Hayakawa et al . ( 2011 ) were the first to report mechanical regulation of cofilin ( Hayakawa et al . 2011 ) . The affinity of cofilin toward the actin filament is largely reduced when the actin filament experiences tension . This indicates that the actin filament is a tension sensor . In terms of speed of propagation and fast response , this regulation is different from other standard regulation processes such as chemi - cal modification or ligand binding . A different mechani - cal regulation on the actin filament was reported recently ( Mizuno et al . 2018 ) . Formins bind to the barbed end of the actin filament and facilitate elongation of the actin filament . Formins move according to the elongation of the filament and continue to bind to the barbed end . Elongated actin fila - ments from formin rotate along the helical pitch of the actin filament when formin is fixed on a glass surface ( Mizuno et al . 2011 ) . When the pointed end side of the actin filament , with formin at the barbed end , is fixed to a glass surface , a rotational force is applied to the actin filament ( Fig . 4c ) . ( Mizuno et al . 2018 ) reported that this rotational force inhibited cofilin binding to the actin filament ( Fig . 4c ) . Cofilin binding to the actin filament makes the actin helix tighter ( Fig . 4b ) . The actin filament under the rotational force caused by formin was observed by electron micros - copy . Under the rotational force , the average length of the actin crossover ( Fig . 4a ) was slightly elongated , which is opposite to the effects of cofilin binding . Without applying force , the actin filament has a defined range of fluctuations , consistent with a previous report ( Egelman et al . 1982 ) . Fig . 4 Twist of the actin fila - ment . a Actin filament [ PDB ID : 5JLF ( von der Ecken et al . 2015 ) ] . The length of the crossover repeat , in which the one strand of the actin filament rotates by 180° , is 36 – 38 nm . b Cofilactin [ PDB ID : 5YU8 ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ) ] . The length of the crossover repeat is 27 – 28 nm . c The actin fila - ment with formin at the B - end . When the filament elongates at the B - end , formin generates rotational forces in the opposite direction to that induced by cofilin binding , which inhibits cofilin binding . d The actin - myosin interaction also inhibit cofilin binding at positions distal from the bound myosin 146 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 141 – 151 1 3 The crossover was sometimes measured as ~ 30 nm , which is similar to the cofilactin crossover ( ~ 27 – 28 nm , Fig . 4b ) . A shorter crossover means the filament form is more twisted . This short crossover was not observed in the presence of this rotational force . This indicates that the actin crossover cannot be shortened by thermal fluctuations under the rota - tional force . The binding inhibition by the rotational force can be explained by two factors . The first factor is that the rotational force simply inhibits the transition of the actin filament ( Fig . 4a ) into the twisted form by cofilin binding ( Fig . 4b ) . This effect can be quantitatively estimated by measuring the strength of the rotational force by formin and the twist - ing force by cofilin binding ; however , these have yet to be measured . Inhibition is explained when the rotational force by formin is stronger than the twisting force by cofilin . A second factor is the structural difference of the actin fila - ment between the normal helical symmetry and an alterna - tive , twisted structure that can spontaneously form without cofilin ( Mizuno et al . 2018 ) . Such a spontaneously twisted form would likely consist of the F - form and not the C - form because the C - form is not stable without cofilin binding ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ) In the situation where the spontaneously twisted form is better for cofilin binding , the population of the spontaneously twisted form would affect the efficiency of cofilin binding . We tested the second factor based on the current cofilactin structure . The D - loop in SD2 ( Fig . 1a ) largely contributes to the OD – ID interaction ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Durer et al . ( 2012 ) indicated that the D - loop undergoes fast conformational exchange even in the actin filament ( Durer et al . 2012 ) , and thus the OD – ID interaction would be spontaneously disrupted occasionally . The outer domain of the B - subunit becomes free and can fluctuate when the OD – ID interaction is lost between the two subunits . The fluctuation is predicted to be larger in the subunit with ADP than that with ATP ( Saunders et al . 2014 ) and the larger fluctuation with ADP is proposed to be important for cofilin binding ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ) . Cofilin binds to the two subunits in one strand . Cofi - lin is proposed to bind to the B - subunit through the “F - site” initially and then approach the P - subunit by this fluctuation . Subsequently , the long side chains constituting the “Gi _ l - site” of the P - subunit ( Fig . 1c , d ) interact with cofilin [ Fig . 5 ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ) ] to capture cofilin around the G - site ( Figs . 1c , d and 5e ) . The most stable state for the actin molecule is the G - actin - like state ( G - form ) ( Oda et al . 2009 , 2019 ) . Therefore , the B - subunit without the OD – ID interaction tends to adopt the G - form and then fluctuates around the G - form ( Fig . 5c , d ) . However , when cofilin binds to the B - subunit and the B - sub - unit becomes the G - form , cofilin will collide with the Go - site of the P - subunit ( Fig . 6a ) ; although , the collision is not very severe . Go - site binding requires transition of the actin form to the C - form and the transition has a large potential barrier ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ) . Therefore , cofilin cannot bind to the Go - site immediately and this steric clash limits the fluctuation of the B - subunit bound by cofilin , which reduces the chance for Gi _ l - site binding ( Fig . 5e ) . Almost no collision was observed when we constructed a twisted actin filament using F - form subunits as a spontane - ously twisted form ( Fig . 6b ) . Moreover , the distance between the alpha carbons in the pair constituting the “Gi _ l - site” is shorter than the normal actin filament by 1 Å on aver - age ( Fig . 6c , d ) in the spontaneously twisted actin filament . Therefore , the rate of cofilin binding to the actin filament should increase by the spontaneously twisted actin filament with a shorter crossover . The dissociation rate of cofilin should not change because the binding state is independent of the actin filament structure at the initial state , spontane - ously twisted or not . Therefore , the spontaneously twisted form is thermodynamically favored by cofilin binding , indi - cating the second factor can contribute to the inhibition of cofilin binding by the rotational force caused by formin ( Mizuno et al . 2018 ) as well as the first factor . Similar phenomena were observed upon myosin bind - ing ( Fig . 4d ) . Actin - myosin interactions also induce right - handed rotation of the actin filament ( Nishizaka et al . 1993 ) and force by myosin inhibits cofilin binding over a long range on the actin filament ( Ngo et al . 2016 ) . This inhibi - tion is also explained by the two factors described above . Effects of tension on the actin filament can be explained in a similar way . MD simulations showed that expanding tension on the actin filament reduces the amplitude of the twist movement of the actin filament ( Matsushita et al . 2011 ) , indicating that the actin filament with a tension is stiffer and a large twist difference from the canonical one is energetically unfavored . The required force for twisting the filament by cofilin binding is larger . The suppressed twist movement also reduces the twisted form population . These factors can inhibit cofilin binding . Other features to be investigated Lastly , I would like to discuss other features about actin - cofilin interactions that should be investigated . Recently , Wioland et al . developed an excellent proce - dure to observe a single actin filament dynamics directly and quantitatively by using a microfluidics chamber and light microscopy , and investigated the function of cofilin ( Wioland et al . 2017 , 2019a , b ) . Many important parameters and features were revealed from their experiments and their results have been used for constructing cofilin functional models ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ) . However , three important fea - tures of the actin - cofilin function that were obtained from their microfluidics chamber appear to be inconsistent with 147 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 141 – 151 1 3 published data . Some hidden parameters may have affected the results and resolving these apparent inconsistencies will greatly improve our understanding of cofilin - mediated actin dynamics . Therefore , it is worth describing them herein . 1 . Direction of cofilin cluster growth on the actin filament . Cofilin binding to the actin filament is cooperative and cofilin forms binding clusters on the actin filament . However , bidirectional or unidirectional growth of the cluster remains unresolved ( Fig . 7a ) . Results from high speed AFM revealed much faster growth of the cofilin cluster at the pointed end side boundary than the other side ( Ngo et al . 2015 ) . In contrast , in a microfluidics chamber the growth of the cofilin cluster was bidi - rectional without showing a rate difference at the two boundaries ( Wioland et al . 2017 ) ( Fig . 7a ) . The actin filament was on a lipid membrane in Ngo et al . ( Ngo et al . 2015 ) , whereas it was in a microfluidics chamber and labeled by fluorescent dyes in Wioland et al . ( Wio - land et al . 2017 ) . These different experimental condi - tions may explain the observed differences . We have proposed a model of the cooperative binding on the actin filament based on the structure ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ) . In our model , cofilin binding should be accelerated on both sides of the cluster but we could not predict which side was faster . 2 . Cofilin is regulated by tension on the actin filament . As already described , the affinity of cofilin to the actin fila - ment is greatly reduced when the actin filament has a tension ( Hayakawa et al . 2011 ) . This was the first report of mechanical regulation of the actin - cofilin interaction . The tension was applied by using laser - trapped beads . However , when the tension was applied by water flow , cofilin could bind to the actin filament and sever the fila - ment ( Wioland et al . 2019b ) . How the force is applied greatly changes the response of the actin - cofilin interac - tion ( Fig . 7b ) . 3 . The severing efficiency on the actin filament fixed at more than two positions on a glass surface . Hayakawa et al . ( 2011 ) also reported that an actin filament mesh fixed on a glass surface by NEM - myosin has a resist - ance against cofilin binding ( Hayakawa et al . 2011 ) . Cut - Fig . 5 Schematic illustrations of a multi - step model for cofilin bind - ing to the actin filament [ modified from ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ) ] . Step 1 : cofilin binds to F - actin through the F - site ( blue ) . The system at this stage is in equilibrium between the bound ( a ) and unbound ( b ) states . ID – OD interactions are indicated by red arrows . Step 2 : ID – OD inter - actions spontaneously disappear and the OD of the B - subunit fluctu - ates around the G - from . The system is still in equilibrium between the bound ( c ) and unbound ( d ) states . e Cofilin bound through the F - site eventually approaches the Gi _ l - site ( brown ) , which is cap - tured through binding of the flexible and extended side chains . g The structural transition in the P - subunits is induced and full G - site bind - ing occurs ( yellow and red ) . f An alternative pathway involves cofilin binding directly to F - actin through the Gi _ l - site without F - site bind - ing 148 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 141 – 151 1 3 ting the mesh with a glass pipette tip resulted in cofilin binding around the cut region . Presumably cofilin bind - ing occurred because the cut actin filaments had free ends and lost tension . However , Wioland et al . ( 2019b ) reported that when the actin filament was fixed at more than two positions by biotin - labeled actin and neutra - vidin , the severing efficiency was much higher in the region where both ends were fixed than the region where one end was free . The manner in which the filament is affixed to the glass surface may induce a difference and explain the different observations between the two reports ( Fig . 7c ) . Long range ( at least more than 10 subunits ) propagation of a structural change of the actin filament outside of the cofilin binding cluster is another controversial phenomenon ( Bobkov et al . 2006 ) . This propagation has been observed directly by high speed AFM ( Ngo et al . 2015 ) . The actin fila - ment crossover of the pointed end side of the cofilin - binding cluster was shortened without cofilin binding ( Fig . 7d ) . 2D classification of a negatively stained sample of the actin fila - ment decorated partially by cofilin also showed a 2D class average with a short crossover ( 29 nm ) without cofilin bind - ing , which was not observed as a major class without cofilin in solution . This implies that the 2D class of the twisted filament without cofilin binding is a result of propagation of a structural change outside of the cofilin binding clus - ter ( Fig . 7d ) and not a spontaneously twisted form ( Aggeli et al . 2014 ) . However , analysis of cryo - EM images could not detect such propagation ( Huehn et al . 2018 ) . The dif - ferent experimental conditions may explain the differences observed . Clearly , further investigation is required on this topic . Concluding remarks Cofilin regulation by phosphorylation , pH and mechanical forces has been described using the recently published cofi - lactin structure . Other features that should be investigated were also described briefly . There remain a range of struc - tural and functional features about cofilin that have not been resolved and should be studied , and cofilin will remain a major research target for several years .

Modeling cofilins bound to the actin filament We constructed models of cofilins bound to the F - site of the B - subunit in an intermediate state in which the B - sub - unit is in the G - form ( Fig . 5c ) . Firstly , we extracted two actin subunits from an actin filament model [ PDB ID : 5JLF ( von der Ecken et al . 2015 ) ] . The G - actin monomer [ PDB ID : 1J6Z ( Otterbein et al . 2001 ) ] was aligned to the barbed end side subunit ( B - subunit ) by the ID , and the B - subunit was exchanged by the aligned G - actin . We named this structure as the GF filament model . Bound cofilin to the F - site of the exchanged G - actin subunit was then constructed as follows ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ) . Step 1 : one actin subunit and one cofilin bound to the actin subunit through the F - site were extracted from the cofilactin struc - ture [ PDB ID : 5YU8 ( Tanaka et al . 2018 ] ) . Step 2 : the SD1 of the actin subunit in the extracted complex from Step 1 was aligned with the SD1 of the G - actin subunit of the GF filament model . Step 3 : Cofilin in the aligned complex was combined with the GF filament model ( Fig . 6a , c , d ) . For the spontaneously twisted actin filament , we extracted two actin subunits from cofilactin ( PDB ID : 5YU8 ) in one strand and aligned the F - form actin subunit ( PDB ID : 5JLF ) to each of the extracted subunits by the ID . The two aligned F - form actin subunits are a model for a spontaneously twisted actin filament . The GF fila - ment model and bound cofilin were constructed using the approach described in the previous paragraph ( Fig . 6b , c , d ) .

Fig . 7 Controversial experi - mental data that requires further investigation . a Is the cofilin binding cluster growth bidi - rectional ( Wioland et al . 2017 ) or unidirectional ( Ngo et al . 2015 ) ? b Cofilin cannot bind to a stretched actin filament by laser trapped beads ( Hayakawa et al . 2011 ) ; however , cofi - lin can bind to and sever the actin filament with a tension imposed by flow ( Wioland et al . 2019b ) . c Cofilin binding is largely suppressed to the actin filament region where both ends are fixed by NEM myosin ( Hayakawa et al . 2011 ) . However , cofilin severing is largely enhanced when the actin filament is fixed by biotin - neu - travidin ( Wioland et al . 2019b ) . d Does the structural change propagate out of the cofilin binding cluster ( Aggeli et al . 2014 ; Ngo et al . 2015 ) or not ( Huehn et al . 2018 ) ? 150 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 141 – 151 1 3 Compliance with ethical standards Conflict of interest The author declares no competing interests .
