The immunological mechanisms underlying these age - related differences in clinical outcomes remain unexplained . Here , we quantify 23 immune cell populations in 141 samples from children and adults with mild COVID - 19 and their PCR - negative close household contacts at acute and convalescent time points . Children with COVID - 19 displayed marked reductions in myeloid cells during infection , most prominent in children under the age of ﬁ ve . Recovery from infection in both children and adults was characterised by the generation of CD8 T CM and CD4 T CM up to 9 weeks post infection . SARS - CoV - 2 - exposed close contacts also had immunological changes over time despite no evidence of con ﬁ rmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection on PCR testing . This included an increase in low - density neutrophils during convalescence in both exposed children and adults , as well as increases in CD8 T CM and CD4 T CM in exposed adults . In comparison to children with other common respiratory viral infections , those with COVID - 19 had a greater change in innate and T cell - mediated immune responses over time . These ﬁ ndings provide new mechanistic insights into the immune response during and after recovery from COVID - 19 in both children and adults .

Children also have lower transmission rates compared to adults , in part because asymptomatic COVID - 19 is less infectious than symptomatic disease ( 3 ) , and because they are less likely to be the primary index case in a household ( 4 – 6 ) . This is in contrast to the higher prevalence and severity observed in children for most other respiratory viruses ( 1 , 7 , 8 ) . Understanding the immunological basis for these age - related differences ( 9 – 11 ) , as well as the factors that contribute to protection in household contacts who remain SARS - CoV - 2 PCR negative despite close and often prolonged exposure ( 12 ) , would help accelerate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to control COVID - 19 . In this study , we used high parameter ﬂ ow cytometry to comprehensively delineate the longitudinal circulating immune cell pro ﬁ les of children and adults with mild COVID - 19 and their close household contacts who were repeatedly PCR negative . To investigate differences in immune responses to SARS - CoV - 2 and other respiratory viruses in children , we also compared the immune response in children with SARS - CoV - 2 infection alone , SARS - CoV - 2 co - infection , and non - SARS - CoV - 2 respiratory viral infections . MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Cohort Participants were families presenting for SARS - CoV - 2 testing at the Royal Children ’ s Hospital Melbourne Australia , between April and September 2020 ( Table 1 ) . A total of 141 samples from SARS - CoV - 2 - positive or SARS - CoV - 2 - exposed but PCR negative children and adults were included in the study ( complete cohort ) . Acute samples were collected within 2 weeks of the ﬁ rst SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test result and follow up samples were collected 4 to 9 weeks after ﬁ rst SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test result . SARS - CoV - 2 - positive individuals were non - hospitalised patients who had a positive PCR test for SARS - CoV - 2 on nasopharyngeal swab and were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms , including coryza , headaches , nausea , fever , cough , sore throat , malaise , and muscle aches ( Table 1 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 - exposed individuals were SARS - CoV - 2 PCR negative on repeated nasopharyngeal swabs and were close contacts of con ﬁ rmed SARS - CoV - 2 - positive patients in their households . Close contact was de ﬁ ned as face - to - face contact for more than 15 minutes and shared closed space with a con ﬁ rmed case of COVID - 19 , in accordance with Victorian state guidelines . All participants in the exposed group had up to ﬁ ve repeat SARS - CoV - 2 PCR tests at 5 - to - 7 - day intervals for 4 weeks , all of which were negative . SARS - CoV - 2 positive children with samples collected during the acute phase were younger than SARS - CoV - 2 exposed children ( median age 2years vs 9years , p = 0 . 02 ) , TABLE 1 | Demographics of study cohort .

Immunity in Children With COVID - 19 Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 741639 2 however no other age or sex differences were found between groups ( see Extended Data ) . SARS - CoV - 2 positive children and adults were more likely to be symptomatic relative to SARS - CoV - 2 exposed children and adults ( Table 1 , Extended Data ) . In a subset of 41 participants , paired acute and follow up samples were available for longitudinal analysis ( Table 1 ) . Additional testing for respiratory pathogens using a commercial multiplex assay ( including in ﬂ uenza A / B , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) A / B , rhinovirus , enterovirus , parechovirus , adenovirus , human parain ﬂ uenza viruses 1 - 4 , human metapneumovirus , Bordetella pertussis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae ) was also available for most participants ( AusDiagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 16 - well assay ) . Of these pathogens , some participants had evidence of RSV A / B , rhinovirus , enterovirus or adenovirus infection ( see extended data for individual results ) whilst all other pathogens were not detected in any sample . Table 1 describes the number of participants with available respiratory panel results , the number of participants in each group positive for other respiratory viruses ( other than SARS - CoV - 2 ) , and the timing of sample collection relative to respiratory panel testing . Diagnosis of SARS - CoV - 2 Infection and Other Respiratory Pathogens Combined oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal ( or deep nasal ) swabs were collected according to national guidelines using dry FLOQSwabs ® ( Copan , Brescia , Italy ) . Brie ﬂ y , FLOQSwabs were eluted in 500 m L of phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and 200 m L of eluent was used for nucleic acid extraction using the Roche Magnapure 96 extraction system ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) , according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . The majority of SARS - CoV - 2 samples were initially tested using the LightMix ® Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E - gene kit ( targeting the E - gene ; sensitivity 96 . 5 % , speci ﬁ city of 98 . 5 % ( 13 ) ; TIB Molbiol , Berlin , Germany ) using 10 m L nucleic acid extract , according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . RT - PCR was performed on the LightCycler 480 II Real - Time PCR System ( Roche ) . Some patient samples were also tested for SARS - CoV - 2 using the AusDiagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 16 - well assay ( Mascot , Australia ) , on the AusDiagnostics High - Plex 24 system [ the SARS - CoV - 2 target of this assay is the ORF - 1 gene ; 98 . 4 % positive agreement with the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory ( VIDRL ) reference assay ( 14 ) ] . The assay also detects other respiratory pathogens including in ﬂ uenza A / B , RSV A / B , rhinovirus , enterovirus , parechovirus , adenovirus , human parain ﬂ uenza viruses 1 - 4 , human metapneumovirus , Bordetella pertussis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae ) , using 10 m L nucleic acid extract . Except in a small number of cases where there was insuf ﬁ cient sample , samples that were SARS - CoV - 2 - positive on a screening assay with a single gene target were con ﬁ rmed by testing on a second assay .

Flow Cytometry of PBMC Samples Blood was collected in EDTA tubes from each participant and processed into peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) ( 15 ) . For ﬂ ow cytometry analysis of freshly isolated PBMC , cells were washed in 1 mL PBS prior to viability staining using BV510 viability dye according to manufacturer ’ s instructions . The viability dye reaction was stopped by the addition of FACS buffer ( 2 % heat - inactivated FCS in 2 mM EDTA ) and cells were centrifuged at 350 x g for 5 minutes . Cells were then resuspended in human FC - block according to manufacturer ’ s instructions for 5 minutes at room temperature . The antibody cocktail ( Supplementary Table 1 ) made up at 2X concentration was added 1 : 1 with the cells and incubated for 30 minutes on ice . Following staining , cells were washed with 2 mL FACS buffer and centrifuged at 350 x g for 5 minutes . Cells were then resuspended in 2 % PFA for a 20 - minute ﬁ xation on ice , washed , and resuspended in 150 µl FACS buffer for acquisition using the BD LSR X - 20 Fortessa ( BD Biosciences , New Jersey , United States ) . For all ﬂ ow cytometry experiments , compensation was done at the time of sample acquisition using compensation beads . Supplementary Figure 1 depicts the manual gating strategy for all samples . Data Analysis Flow cytometry data were analysed using FlowJo Version 10 . 7 . 1 software . Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection ( UMAP ) analyses were conducted using concatenated ﬁ les containing 5 , 000 randomly selected live single cells per sample . Manually gated results are presented as proportion of live cells . For CD4 and CD8 T cell subset analyses , results are presented as proportion of parent gate . Data was plotted in Prism version 8 . 0 . 0 . For differential abundance analysis of all groups in cross - sectional cohorts ( Figures 1 , 2 , 4 ) , p - values were determined by Kruskal - Wallis rank sum test and adjusted for multiple comparisons ( x23 cell populations ) using the Benjamini and Hochberg approach to control the false discovery rate ( FDR ) ( 16 ) . FDR - adjusted p < 0 . 05 were considered signi ﬁ cant . For cell types showing an FDR - adjusted signi ﬁ cant difference , Dunn ’ s multiple comparison testing was used to ﬁ nd differences between clinical groups . For statistical testing of the longitudinal cohort ( Figure 3 ) , p - values were determined by two - way repeated measures analysis of variance and adjusted for multiple comparisons [ x46 ( 23 cell populations , p ( group ) and p ( time ) ) ] using the Benjamini and Hochberg approach to control the false discovery rate ( FDR ) . FDR - adjusted p < 0 . 05 were considered signi ﬁ cant . For cell types showing an FDR - adjusted signi ﬁ cant difference , Sidak ’ s multiple comparison testing was used to ﬁ nd differences over time . All statistical analysis was performed in Prism version 9 . 0 . 0 , with multiple comparison correction performed in RStudio version 4 . 0 . 3 . Boxplots show the medians , the 1 st and 3 rd quartiles as well as the smallest and largest values as whiskers . Individual data points are shown . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Comparison of Immune Cell Pro ﬁ les in Children and Adults Clinical characteristics and demographics of the patients in this study are shown in Table 1 . We ﬁ rst investigated differences in the circulating immune cell pro ﬁ le between children and adults using high dimensional ﬂ ow cytometry and analysis on freshly Neeland et al . Immunity in Children With COVID - 19 Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 741639 3 isolated PBMCs . Children were aged between 1 and 17 years , and adults between 19 and 62 years ( Figure 1A ) . UMAP analysis of all samples revealed clusters associated with CD4 T cells [ naïve ( T N ) , central memory ( T CM ) , effector CD45RA + ( T EMRA ) and effector memory ( T EM ) ] , CD8 T cells [ naïve ( T N ) , central memory ( T CM ) , effector CD45RA + ( T EMRA ) and effector memory ( T EM ) ] , B cells , NK cells ( CD56 + CD16 + , CD56 + CD16 - and CD56 bright CD16 - ) , monocytes ( classical : CD14 + CD16 - , intermediate : CD14 + CD16 + , non - classical : CD14 low CD16 + ) and dendritic cells ( Figure 1B ) . Children had signi ﬁ cantly higher proportions of CD4 T N and CD8 T N cells , whilst adults showed a clear shift toward CD4 and CD8 T memory cell populations ( Supplementary Figure 2A ) . Children also had higher proportions of circulating B cells relative to adults ( Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure 2A ) . While studies investigating the complete immune cell pro ﬁ le of children are rare , our ﬁ ndings are consistent with previous reports of cell subsets investigated in isolation that show a shift from naive to memory T cells with age , as well as higher proportions of circulating B cells in children relative to adults ( 17 , 18 ) .

Immunity in Children With COVID - 19 Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 741639 4 SARS - CoV - 2 - Positive Children Show Marked Alterations in Myeloid Cells During Infection We next explored cross - sectional differences in immune cell pro ﬁ les between children and adults with or exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 . Samples were collected during or approximately 4 - to - 9 weeks post infection / exposure from SARS - CoV - 2 - positive and SARS - CoV - 2 - exposed children and adults . No signi ﬁ cant differences in proportions of total CD4 T cells , total CD8 T cells or regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) were observed between children and adults with or exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 ( Figure 1C ) . We found that SARS - CoV - 2 - positive children had lower proportions of dendritic cells and monocytes during the acute phase relative to follow up [ median proportion in SARS - CoV - 2 positive children acute vs follow up – dendritic cells : 0 . 23 % vs 0 . 44 % ( p = 0 . 02 ) , and monocytes : 1 . 04 % vs 2 . 75 % ( p = 0 . 05 ) ] ( Figure 1C ) . Further analysis of monocyte subsets revealed lower proportions of both the intermediate and non - classical monocyte subsets in SARS - CoV - 2 - positive children during infection compared to the same group at follow up [ median proportion acute vs follow up – intermediate monocytes : 0 . 04 % vs 0 . 15 % ( p = 0 . 04 ) , and non - classical monocytes : 0 . 09 % vs 0 . 44 % ( p = 0 . 05 ) ] ( Figure 2A ) . SARS - CoV - 2 - positive adults also had reduced proportions of non - classical monocytes during the acute phase compared to follow up [ median proportion of non - classical monocytes in SARS - CoV - 2 positive adults acute vs follow up : 0 . 44 % vs 0 . 91 % ( p = 0 . 05 ) ] ( Figure 2A ) . This is consistent with our previous ﬁ ndings in an interim analysis of this cohort , revealing low circulating proportions of monocyte subsets and dendritic cells in SARS - CoV - 2 - positive children ( 19 ) . Previous work by our team using pre - pandemic PBMCs from healthy children aged 1 - 15 years shows an average circulating frequency of 0 . 8 % for dendritic cells and 4 . 8 % for monocytes ( 20 , 21 ) , further highlighting the reduced proportions observed during the acute phase in SARS - CoV - 2 positive children . It should be noted that our sampling strategy for the complete cohort involved a mix of repeated sampling from the same participants as well as single sampling from participants at either timepoint , whichever was feasible . This may lead to some selection bias in the analysis for those with repeated sampling . However , we conducted a sensitivity analysis of only participants with single samples , revealing the same changes over time in these cell populations ( see Extended Data ) . Several other reports have also shown reduced proportions of monocytes and NK cells in the blood of adults with COVID - 19 , possibly re ﬂ ecting redistribution of these cells to the lung ( 22 – 25 ) . Single cell sequencing studies of bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) samples from patients with varying COVID - 19 severity provide further evidence for in ﬁ ltration of innate cells into the lung during acute infection ( 26 ) . Alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells have been shown to be enriched in the BAL of patients with mild COVID - 19 disease , whilst severe disease is associated with in ﬁ ltration of neutrophils , NK cells and monocyte - derived macrophages ( 27 ) . A recent single cell analysis of lung tissue from adults with lethal COVID - 19 revealed dense in ﬁ ltration of monocyte - derived macrophages , impaired T cell responses , as well as monocyte and epithelial cell - derived in ﬂ ammatory cytokines ( 28 ) .

Immunity in Children With COVID - 19 Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 741639 6 Immune Responses in Younger and Older Children During Acute Infection Combined , our results suggest that SARS - CoV - 2 - positive children show more pronounced changes in innate immune cell populations compared to infected adults . These results may , in part , provide a mechanistic explanation for the reduced susceptibility and severity of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children compared to adults ( 1 ) . Recent data suggests further reduced severity and transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in younger children compared to adolescents ( 2 , 4 , 29 ) . We therefore compared immune cell pro ﬁ les in SARS - CoV - 2 - positive children under ﬁ ve years of age ( median age 1 . 5 years ) to those over age ﬁ ve ( median age 10 . 5 years ) during the acute phase of infection ( Figure 2B ) .

Immunity in Children With COVID - 19 Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 741639 7 showed signi ﬁ cantly lower proportions of circulating monocytes and dendritic cells during infection compared to SARS - CoV - 2 - positive children over the age of ﬁ ve [ median proportion during infection in children under ﬁ ve vs over ﬁ ve – monocytes : 0 . 5 % vs 2 . 26 % ( p = 0 . 02 ) , and dendritic cells : 0 . 2 % vs 0 . 32 % ( p = 0 . 008 ) ] . Within the monocyte subpopulations , signi ﬁ cantly lower proportions of both classical and intermediate monocytes were observed in SARS - CoV - 2 - positive children under ﬁ ve relative to positive children over the age of ﬁ ve [ median proportion during infection in children under ﬁ ve vs over ﬁ ve – classical monocytes : 0 . 38 % vs 2 . 07 % ( p = 0 . 01 ) and intermediate monocytes : 0 . 02 % vs 0 . 06 % ( p = 0 . 04 ) ] ( Figure 2B ) . Innate immune differences between infected children and infected adults were therefore most evident in infants and pre - school aged children . Few studies have directly compared immune responses to SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children and adults . One recent study compared cytokine , humoral and cellular immune responses in children and adults hospitalised with COVID - 19 . This revealed that children had a shorter length of hospital stay , decreased requirement for ventilation and lower mortality compared to adults . SARS - CoV - 2 speci ﬁ c CD4 T cell responses and neutralising antibody titres were higher in adults compared to children ( 30 ) . A comparison of severe paediatric COVID - 19 , MIS - C and severe adult COVID - 19 revealed that MIS - C patients had similar levels of T cell activation as severely ill adults . Robust activation of CX3CR1 + CD8 T cells was unique to MIS - C patients , whose immune activation resolved with treatment and recovery ( 31 ) . Systems serology analysis of antibodies in children and the elderly revealed that whilst elderly individuals induce more class switched antibodies that target cross - reactive regions of SARS - CoV - 2 , infected children have antibodies with enhanced Fc functions that are more effective in clearing the virus ( 32 ) . Temporal Changes in CD8 and CD4 T Cell Central Memory Subsets in SARS - CoV - 2 - Positive Children and Adults Using longitudinally collected samples from the same patients during infection and up to 9 weeks post - infection ( Figures 3A , B and Supplementary Figure 3 ) , we show a signi ﬁ cant increase in the proportion of dendritic cells and monocytes over time ( p = 0 . 0009 and p = 0 . 02 , respectively ) ( Figure 3C ) . Post - hoc testing revealed that SARS - CoV - 2 - positive children showed a signi ﬁ cant increase in dendritic cells over time ( median proportion during infection 0 . 23 % vs follow up 0 . 52 % , p = 0 . 008 ) . Changes in cell frequency over time in children and adults are highlighted by the UMAP analyses in Figure 3B . Children and adults had signi ﬁ cant differences in the proportion of naïve and effector CD8 and CD4 T cell populations at both time points that were independent of SARS - CoV - 2 status and related to age ( Figures 3D , E and Supplementary Figure 2C , D ) . However , central memory CD8 T cells ( CD8 T CM ) signi ﬁ cantly increased over time in SARS - CoV - 2 - infected children and adults [ median proportion of CD8 T CM acute vs follow up – SARS - CoV - 2 positive children : 4 . 22 % vs 8 . 99 % ( p = 0 . 006 ) , SARS - CoV - 2 positive adults : 6 . 67 vs 13 . 91 ( p < 0 . 0001 ) ] ( Figure 3D ) . Central memory CD4 T cells ( CD4 T CM ) also showed the same response , signi ﬁ cantly increasing over time in SARS - CoV - 2 infected children and adults [ median proportion of CD4 T CM acute vs follow up – SARS - CoV - 2 positive children : 12 . 4 % vs 26 . 41 % ( p = 0 . 001 ) , SARS - CoV - 2 positive adults : 28 . 5 % vs 40 . 59 % ( p = 0 . 002 ) ] ( Figure 3E ) . We also report signi ﬁ cant decreases in proportion of naïve CD4 T cells ( CD4 T N ) in SARS - CoV - 2 - positive adults between the acute and follow up phases [ median proportion 41 . 97 % vs 27 . 53 % ( p = 0 . 001 ) ] . These results highlight that both CD8 and CD4 central memory T cells may play key roles in the immune response to SARS - CoV - 2 in both children and adults , with increases in this cell population observed during the convalescent period in participants diagnosed with COVID - 19 . Previous work by our team using pre - pandemic PBMCs from healthy children ( 11 - 14 years ) shows an average frequency of 5 . 12 % for CD8 T CM , further highlighting the increase in CD8 T CM in the SARS - CoV - 2 positive children ( 20 ) . A study analysing longitudinal samples from adults with mild COVID - 19 showed the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 speci ﬁ c memory CD8 and CD4 T cells out to 6 months post infection ( 33 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 speci ﬁ c CD8 T cells consisted primarily of T EMRA phenotype with small populations of T CM and T EM cells . SARS - CoV - 2 speci ﬁ c CD4 T cells , however , were primarily of T CM or T EM phenotype ( 33 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 speci ﬁ c CD8 and CD4 T cells were also identi ﬁ ed at 8 months post infection in another study comparing mild and severe disease , with greater memory CD4 T cell cytokine responses observed in severe patients relative to those of asymptomatic patients ( 34 ) . Similarly , signi ﬁ cantly larger overall T cell responses were observed in convalescent patients who had severe compared with mild disease , however mild disease was associated with greater SARS - CoV - 2 speci ﬁ c CD8 T cell responses ( 35 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 - Exposed Children and Adults Show Immune Cell Changes Over Time SARS - CoV - 2 - exposed but PCR - negative close contact participants also had changes in their immune cell pro ﬁ les over time , despite no evidence of con ﬁ rmed infection . Exposed PCR - negative children and adults both had increases in low - density immature neutrophils ( de ﬁ ned as SSC high CD16 + cells in PBMCs ) at follow up compared to acute phase [ median proportion of low - density neutrophils acute vs follow up – exposed children : 0 . 07 % vs 1 . 95 % ( p = 0 . 001 ) , exposed adults : 0 . 31 % vs 1 . 42 % ( p = 0 . 02 ) ] ( Figure 1C and Figure 3B ) . These neutrophils , with reduced granularity compared to conventional neutrophils and observed in mononuclear low density cell fractions , have been reported in adults with severe COVID - 19 and may represent emergency myelopoiesis ( 36 – 38 ) . CD8 T CM and CD4 T CM also increased over time in SARS - CoV - 2 - exposed adults [ median proportion acute vs follow up – CD8 T CM : 9 . 04 % vs 14 . 28 % ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , CD4 T CM : 27 . 10 vs 36 . 45 ( p = 0 . 0034 ) ] , but not in SARS - CoV - 2 - exposed children [ median proportion acute vs follow up - CD8 T CM : 3 . 8 % vs 5 . 46 % ( p = 0 . 70 ) , CD4 T CM : 15 % vs 17 . 5 % ( p = 0 . 94 ) ] ( Figures 3D , E ) . Neeland et al . Immunity in Children With COVID - 19 Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 741639 8 As the changes in the SARS - CoV - 2 - exposed group over time were not antigen - speci ﬁ c , we next explored whether these responses were in ﬂ uenced by infection with other respiratory viruses in some of our SARS - CoV - 2 - exposed participants . We compared SARS - CoV - 2 participants with or without infection with other respiratory viruses at both acute and follow up timepoints . This showed that the changes observed in key cell types over time in the exposed groups – low density neutrophils in both children ( Figure 4B ) and adults ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) , as well as CD8 T CM and CD4 T CM in adults ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) – occurred in all exposed participants , independent of the presence of other respiratory viruses . In fact , changes over time in CD8 T CM and CD4 T CM cells were most evident in SARS - CoV - 2 - exposed adults without co - infection with other respiratory pathogens [ median proportion acute vs follow up - CD8 T CM : 9 . 14 % vs 16 . 00 % ( p = 0 . 0034 ) , CD4 T CM : 27 . 89 % vs 42 . 54 % ( p = 0 . 0001 ) ] ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . As close contact exposed participants in our cohort were all repeatedly negative upon SARS - CoV - 2 PCR testing , these results suggest that exposure in the household can lead to the generation of T cell immunity even in the absence of con ﬁ rmed infection . These results may also suggest that the exposed participants were infected with a low viral load that was undetectable by PCR testing . This observation is supported by a recent study exploring memory T cell responses in household close contacts ( exposed but PCR negative ) of con ﬁ rmed COVID - 19 patients , showing that both COVID - 19 patients and their close contacts generate SARS - CoV - 2 speci ﬁ c CD8 and CD4 T cell memory responses ( 39 ) . The authors hypothesised that the generation of virus speci ﬁ c T cell immunity in SARS - CoV - 2 - exposed individuals in the absence of infection was either due to exposure to a limited number of viral particles or exposure for short time . In a previous case study of two parents with PCR - con ﬁ rmed symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection and their three SARS - CoV - 2 PCR negative children , we also showed that exposed children can mount a cellular immune response characterised by changes in both innate and adaptive immune cells ( 40 ) . Differences in Immune Responses Between Children With SARS - CoV - 2 Infection Alone , SARS - CoV - 2 Co - Infection , and Other Respiratory Viral Infections As we were interested to explore differences in immune responses between children with COVID - 19 and other respiratory infections , we compared children with SARS - CoV - 2 single infection ( SARS - CoV - 2 - positive , respiratory - negative ) , SARS - CoV - 2 co - infection ( SARS - CoV - 2 - positive , respiratory - positive ) and children with non - SARS - CoV - 2 respiratory viral infection ( SARS - CoV - 2 negative , respiratory - positive ) ( Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure 5 ) . These results show that the SARS - CoV - 2 single - and co - infected children show the greatest change in response over time in monocyte subpopulations and dendritic cells ( Figure 4C ) , as well as CD8 T CM cells ( Figure 4D ) , relative to non - SARS - CoV - 2 respiratory - positive children . Children with SARS - CoV - 2 co - infection show the lowest proportions of intermediate and non - classical monocytes at the acute timepoint ( intermediate : 0 . 03 % and non - classical : 0 . 04 % ) followed by SARS - CoV - 2 single infected children ( intermediate : 0 . 04 % and non - classical : 0 . 12 % ) , non - SARS - CoV - 2 respiratory infected children ( intermediate : 0 . 05 % and non - classical : 0 . 14 % ) , and ﬁ nally SARS - CoV - 2 negative respiratory - negative children ( intermediate : 0 . 08 % and non - classical : 0 . 25 % ) . The lowest proportion of circulating dendritic cells was also observed in the SARS - CoV - 2 co - infected children during the acute phase ( Figure 4C ) . SARS - CoV - 2 single - infected children were the only group to show a signi ﬁ cant increase in CD8 T CM cells over time ( median 3 . 8 % acute vs 9 . 7 % follow up ) , however this trend was also observed in SARS - CoV - 2 co - infected children over time ( median 4 . 5 % acute vs 8 . 8 % follow up ) and non - SARS - CoV - 2 respiratory infected children ( 3 . 7 % acute vs 6 . 9 % follow up ) ( Figure 4D ) . Similar results were also seen for CD4 T CM cells in SARS - CoV - 2 single - infected children ( median 11 . 8 % acute vs 31 . 7 % follow up ) and co - infected children ( median 12 . 4 % acute vs 16 . 9 % follow up ) but not in non - SARS - CoV - 2 respiratory infected children ( median 16 . 5 % acute vs 18 . 0 % follow up ) ( Figure 4E ) . Combined , these data suggest that SARS - CoV - 2 induces a greater change in monocyte , dendritic cell , CD8 T CM and CD4 T CM responses in children compared to other common childhood respiratory viruses . However , we acknowledge the small numbers in our groups and these results should be con ﬁ rmed in larger studies . CONCLUSION In summary , we characterised the circulating immune cell landscape of children and adults with mild COVID - 19 , as well as their PCR - negative close contacts during and up to 9 weeks post infection . We directly compared immune cell pro ﬁ les in children and adults , revealing markedly low proportions of circulating innate immune cells in SARS - CoV - 2 - positive children during acute infection , most evident in children under the age of ﬁ ve . These results suggest enhanced recruitment of these circulating innate immune cells to sites of infection , such as the lung . The generation of CD8 T CM and CD4 T CM cells up to 9 weeks post infection were common to both SARS - CoV - 2 - positive children and adults . Exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 in household close contacts also resulted in a change in immune cells over time despite no evidence of con ﬁ rmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection and independent of the presence of other respiratory viruses . This response was characterised by increases in low - density neutrophils at follow up , as well as increases in CD8 T CM and CD4 T CM over time in exposed adults . A comparison of immune responses in children with COVID - 19 to children with other common respiratory infections revealed that SARS - CoV - 2 infection induced a greater change in innate and T cell mediated immune responses . Our work adds to recent studies exploring immunity and clinical outcomes in children with mild COVID - 19 ( 19 , 32 , 41 ) and provides new mechanistic insights into the immune response during and after recovery from COVID - 19 in both children and adults .
