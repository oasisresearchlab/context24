We suggest that the subjective assessment criteria that information - seekers use to process information resources and the information they contain can be used to produce design guidelines for online information resources . This is tested using data from a participant in an eighteen - month longitudinal study of expectant and new mothers . From our participant , three information resource assessment criteria ( convenience , credibility , and format ) and five information assessment criteria ( complete , easy to understand , references , relevance and reliability ) were identified . These eight criteria were used to generate design guidelines to meet the needs of our participant . This article provides an analysis tool that can be used by other researchers to collect and analyse subjective assessment criteria . Keywords : information processing ; information use ; longitudinal ; information behaviour ; subjective assessment criteria ; design guidelines ; Introduction To design an effective online resource , it is essential to understand the information behaviour of the target audience ( Zhang , Wang , Heaton , & Winkler , 2012 ) . Information behaviour includes ‘ those activities a person may engage in when identifying his or her own need for information , searching for such information in any way , and using or transferring that information’ ( Wilson , 1999 , p . 249 ) . This paper uses data from a longitudinal study of the information behaviour of expectant and new mothers to explore an area of information behaviour that has received insufficient attention , namely information use ( Case & O ' Connor , 2015 ) . 3 This paper posits that a more accurate term for information use is information processing and use . This is because it covers the processing of information and the internal and behavioural use of that information , Figure 1 . This paper focuses on the first phase of information processing and use , information processing . The aim of information processing is to determine if the information found during information - seeking resolves the information needs which prompted the search ( Wilson , 1981 ) . This research examines how information seekers use subjective assessment criteria to process different information resources and the information they contain . The central thesis of this study posits that by identifying the subjective assessment criteria used by a target population during information processing , design guidelines can be created for online information resources . It has been proposed that pregnancy and parenting ‘ are extremely rich contexts in which to study information - seeking practices ’ ( McKenzie , 2004 , p . 686 ) . This paper provides a longitudinal analysis of the information processing of a first - time mother . This analysis , which includes data from seven semi - structured interviews and activity diaries , is conducted over approximately eighteen months . The analysis is used to offer new insights into information processing , and to produce design guidelines for an online resource . The remainder of the paper is structured as follows : the next section discusses the literature on information processing and use . The methodology section provides an overview of the wider longitudinal study before providing insight into the participant selected for inclusion in this paper . The findings section discusses the subjective assessment criteria for one study participant . The paper concludes with a discussion of the value of subjective assessment criteria and an example of design guidelines that can be derived . Defining Information Processing and Use Researchers have repeatedly highlighted the ambiguity surrounding information use ( Bawden 4 & Robinson , 2012 ; Case & O ' Connor , 2015 ; Niemelä , Huotari , & Kortelainen , 2012 ) . It is an area that has been frequently referenced but is rarely explicated ( Savolainen , 2009b ) . Instead , it is left as an ambiguous appendix to information - seeking ( ibid ) . It is perhaps unsurprising then that researchers have also highlighted the lack of empirical investigation into information use ( Niemelä et al . , 2012 ; Tuominen & Savolainen , 1997 ) , particularly when compared to other areas within information behaviour , such as information needs and seeking ( Case & O ' Connor , 2015 ) . One of the difficulties for researchers lies in the inconsistent and interchangeable use of terminology ( Kari , 2010 ; Savolainen , 2009a ) . The terms used include information use , information processing , knowledge utilisation , information utilisation , information use behaviour and information use outcome ( Choo , Bergeron , Detlor , & Heaton , 2008 ; Spink & Currier , 2006 ; Todd , 1999 ) . Several attempts at categorising definitions exist , including Kirk ( 2002 ) and Kari ( 2010 ) . However , Savolainen ( 2006 ) provides the most concise during his discussion on sensemaking . He suggests that there are basically ‘ two major viewpoints : ( a ) information use as a process , and ( b ) the various outcomes of this process ’ ( 2006 , p . 1120 ) . From this perspective , we suggest that information processing and use is a better and more inclusive term than information use . Information processing and use allows for two phases , the first where information is processed by the information - seeker and the second where the processed information is utilised by the seeker , Figure 1 . Figure 1 . Information Processing and Use 5 Information Processing The first phase of information processing and use is information processing , Figure 1 . Within information processing , there are two stages , ( 1 ) evaluation , and ( 2 ) comparison . Evaluation examines individual information resources and the information that they contain , whereas comparison looks at groups of information resources . The aim of this phase is to discover if the information found satisfies the seeker’s information need ( Wilson , 1981 ) . During the comparison stage of information processing , information - seekers may compare information from multiple resources as a method of verification ( Ellis , 1993 ; Watson , 2014 ) . Information - seekers may also choose to combine the information into one ‘information product’ ( Foster , 2004 ; Watson , 2014 ) . This stage can involve both external information resources and internal cues , such as relevant prior beliefs or past experiences ( Wood , Kallgren , & Preisler , 1985 ) . When comparing resources information - seekers can be biased by factors such as confirmation bias or search engine ranking ( R . White , 2013 ) . Research has highlighted issues related to the increasing quantity of information available online and its variable quality ( Kim , Park , & Bozeman , 2011 ; Sillence , Briggs , Harris , & Fishwick , 2007 ) . Although many instruments exist for rating the quality of eHealth resources , it has been suggested that they may not be practical for information - seekers to use ( Bernstam , Shelton , Walji , & Meric - Bernstam , 2005 ) and are not effective at highlighting inaccurate information ( Bernstam et al . , 2008 ) . In order to offer new insights , this paper focuses on the subjective assessment criteria that the information - seeker uses to evaluate and compare different information resources , and the information they contain . This allows us to produce design guidelines based on the information - seekers actual behaviour and preferences . 6 Information Use The second phase of information processing and use is information use , Figure 1 . Information use can be internal and / or behavioural ( Kari , 2007 ) . Behavioural information use involves observable physical actions such as a change in the information - seeker’s behaviour or the sharing of information . Behavioural use is similar to what Niemelä et al . ( 2012 ) term enactment . Internal information use includes any cognitive or affective changes within the information - seeker ( Dervin , 1999 ) . Information - seeking can result in both positive or negative affective impact on the information - seeker ( R . W . White & Horvitz , 2009 ) . As these changes occur within the information - seeker’s mind they are not directly observable ( Spink & Cole , 2006 ) ; therefore , researchers rely on information - seekers to explicitly state any cognitive or affective changes they experience . However , inputs , such as information resources accessed and outputs , such as behavioural information use are observable ( Spink & Cole , 2006 ) . These inputs and outputs may allow the researcher to make inferences into the cognitive and affective changes that have occurred . Methodology This study is part of a larger exploratory longitudinal study into the information behaviour of expectant and new mothers . Longitudinal studies enable an in - depth understanding of the interaction between variables and how their relationships change over time ( Jurison , 1996 ) . However , they are relatively rare in mainstream IS ( information systems ) and particularly in information behaviour studies ( cf . Anker , Reinhart , & Feeley , 2011 ; Jurison , 1996 ) . Considering the longitudinal nature of the study , the case study approach was deemed appropriate because it is suited to situations where it is difficult to remove the context from the subject being investigated ( Yin , 2003 ) . Data was collected using a mix of semi - structured 7 interviews and activity diaries . Semi - structured interviews provide the opportunity to collect detailed evidence while also leaving flexibility to encourage participants to add additional information they might think is important ( Remenyi & Williams , 1995 ) . The interviews were scheduled at approximately three - month intervals , meaning that each participant was to be interviewed seven times by the end of the study . An interview guide is provided in Appendix A . The activity diaries were used by participants to record the frequency and type of information behaviour over the duration of the study . The participants gathered information on topics they researched . They also recorded and rated information resources that they accessed . A sample activity diary for the participant is included in Appendix B . The study started with twelve participants . Attrition is a known complication of longitudinal studies ( Ruspini , 1999 ) . Data from those participants that completed four or more interviews was included in the study . This provided coverage for both the antenatal and postnatal periods . As a result , the study concluded with nine participants , seven of whom completed the full seven interviews , Table 1 . By observing the participants during both the antenatal and postnatal period , it afforded us the opportunity to note changes in participant information behaviour , including the factors that influenced those changes .

Longitudinal Data Collection across all Study Participants 8 Participant Eight ( P8 ) This paper focuses on a single participant ( P8 ) , Table 1 . P8 completed all seven interviews . An overview of the characteristics of P8 is provided in Table 2 . These are provided to provide insight into P8 . Characteristics of the seeker have been shown to impact on individuals information behaviour ( Wilson , 1997 ) . As such , Table 2 demonstrates areas of information behaviour that were influenced by P8’s characteristics . For example , P8’s work as a special needs assistant influenced the creations of tasks and the evaluation of information and resources . P8 also used the experience she gained in work as an extra information resource , comparing it to other information resources Area of Information Behaviour Characteristics of the Seeker ( P8 ) First - time mother > 35 In a relationship Has master’s degree Worked as a special needs assistant Tasks Wanted a second child , in the postnatal period researched factors influencing fertility . Had an interest in childhood development and parenting strategy as a result of her masters and work experience . Information - Seeking Her partner searched for information on her behalf ( proxy search ) . Information Processing Her partner influenced her opinion of online discussion forums . Helped her to evaluate information resources & information . Altered how she evaluated information resources when she returned to work after maternity leave – limited time / availability of resources . Compared information she found against experience gained in work . Table 2 . Examples of How Characteristics of the Seeker Influence Information Behaviour 9 Coding the Data This study examines P8’s subjective assessment criteria for information resources . Information resources have previously been classified in several different ways including traditional / non - traditional ( Gray , Klein , Noyce , Sesselberg , & Cantrill , 2005 ) and subjective / objective ( Cooley & Madupu , 2009 ) . Personal , online and print resources are common categories across several different classifications ( Bronstein , 2010 ; Lee , Paik , & Joo , 2012 ; Pálsdóttir , 2008 ; Rieh & Danielson , 2007 ; Savolainen , 2010 ) . All personal resources are sometimes included in one category ( Bronstein , 2010 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ) while other classifications separate expert resources into a separate category ( Pálsdóttir , 2008 ; Savolainen , 2010 ) . Similarly , mass media has been included in the same category as print resources ( Pálsdóttir , 2008 ) and has also been separated into its own category ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Rieh , 2007 ) . The information resources in this study are classified under five headings , Figure 2 . Figure 2 . Information Resources Categories The next step in coding the data was to build a tool to examine the subjective criteria across all the information resource categories . Table 3 includes all five information resource 10 categories and examines the subjective assessment criteria for both information resources and information .

Subjective Assessment Criteria Analysis Tool Findings This section examines the subjective assessment criteria used by participant ( P8 ) to process information resources and the information contained within these resources . Each criterion is discussed individually using illustrative examples , to emphasise criteria that could be developed into design guidelines . Many of the quotes used in Table 4 relate to online resources as they were one of P8’s primary information resources . While this is useful for the development of design guidelines for online resources , useful insight can also be gained from P8’s evaluation of other resource categories . The lack of quotes referencing multimedia is reflective of the fact that P8 rarely reported accessing multimedia resources . P8 viewed online and personal resources as convenient sources of information . Online resources were convenient because they were readily available at any time . Personal resources and the Babycentre newsletter were convenient because they brought information to her , without her having to actively seek it . P8 found that interesting topics could naturally come up in conversation when she spoke to people , Table 4 . The newsletter was emailed weekly until the child was a year old . The weekly frequency suited P8 until she returned to 11 work , because she then had less time . It would have suited P8’s needs if the newsletter had changed to monthly earlier . Information Resource Quotes PL EX O PT MM I n f o r m a t i o n R e s o u r c e C r i t e r i a C o n v e n i e n c e X ‘Yeah , [ the newsletter ] comes and I always look at it . I find it actually very convenient . ’ X ‘For the health stuff , I would look a lot at the internet because it’s easier . It’s just accessible anytime . ’ X ‘I suppose I would talk to people more about general information because it comes up in conversation as well . ’ C r e d i b ili t y X X ‘Obviously , I prefer if I recognise who wrote it , I would even Google the name of the author though I don’t tend to do that with websites that much . It’s mostly with books that I would Google the authors . ’ X ‘I highly recommend it for parents ; it’s called the Alpha Parent . It’s written by a woman , a mother who has a lot of qualifications in childcare as well . ’ X ‘People write anything in forums you can’t really trust them . ’ X ‘I would listen to my sister if she told me something . But that’s the thing ; I would listen to my sister because I trust my sister . ’ X ‘I spoke to first friends , people who had experience . ’ F o r m a t X ‘Some websites look like really bad websites . Now having said that there might be good articles in sites like that , but overall I think aesthetically when a site is full of ads or flashing ads or things like that it can be a bit dodgy . ’ I n f o r m a t i o n C r i t er i a C o m p l e t e X ‘But they were not actually telling you what to do , and you didn’t realise this until you had read the book until the very end .

Anything that can go wrong . I would like it to be covered . ’ E a s y t o und er s t a nd X ‘Well for me it depends on how it is written , and what they say because people tend to exaggerate sometimes . ’ X X ‘The language is definitely important , I mean how well written something is . ’ X ‘They communicated all this information very clearly . I found them in the labour ward amazing . ’ R e f ere n ce s X ‘The Alpha Parent Blog has a lot of links to articles because [ the author ] is doing the research in a scientific way . ’ X ‘I suppose a good site for me is a site that has links to the references where they get their own information from .

Subjective Assessment Criteria 12 P8 determined the credibility of print resources based on the expertise of the author , Table 4 . Although P8 stated that she did not regularly research the expertise of the producers of website content , P8 did find the Alpha Parent blog more credible because it listed the author’s qualifications and personal experience as a mother . P8 spent much of the study wary of the information provided on online discussion forums ; part of the reason for this was the fact that she could not authenticate who produced the information . Trust is an important factor within credibility judgements ; from Table 4 it is evident that P8 trusted the advice of her sister . This was also the case with her partner , whom P8 relied on to search for information for her , to act as a proxy searcher . For P8 , personal experience in a particular area was something that gave the resource credibility . However , P8 often liked to access both personal experience and fact - based medical resources together , that way she could verify the information from two different angles . For example , during the antenatal period , P8 accessed personal resources along with online medical studies to verify information on co - sleeping she had found in a book . The personal resources gave her insight into the experiences of parents , whereas the medical information explained information on stress hormones . When P8 negatively evaluated the format of an information resource , she tended to reject the resource before evaluating the information . On the other hand , effective use of multimedia such as images and video has aided P8 to process information . For example , P8 compared different images of tumours to help her conceptualise her own . P8 was waiting on the results of a scan to discover if her tumour had shrunk ; she found looking online at the size of different tumours reassuring because there was ‘ no way in hell [ she ] could have one of these inside [ her ] . ’ P8 recounted how she selected a book solely based on the format of the book . This book on infant weaning was a publication that P8 would have typically overlooked , due to a conflict in parenting approach , however she found the outlines and the 13 chapter summaries appealing . Subsequently , she incorporated this publication into her weaning strategy P8 preferred to have a complete picture , to have all the information , including the worst case scenario , Table 4 . P8 found that it made it easier to make a decision . During the postnatal period , P8 had to decide between the conflicting advice from her GP and a lactation consultant . In the end , P8 choose a hybrid of the two solutions . This resulted in medical complications . Several months later , P8 found a medical article online which explained the lactation consultant’s advice in further detail , including the biological processes involved . P8 felt frustrated because she would have paid greater attention to the lactation consultant’s advice if it had been explained to her in those terms . P8 discussed the importance of language and communication for expert , online and print resources , Table 4 . It was important to P8 that information was easy to understand . The quality of the writing influenced P8’s judgement of the quality and credibility of the message . Although there were some complications during P8’s delivery , she found that the medical professionals ensured that they clearly communicated everything that was happening . This helped to reassure P8 . The importance and usefulness of references was something P8 discussed on a number of occasions during the study . P8 considered references in a website to be a sign of quality information that was produced from scientific research , Table 4 . P8 also stated that her ideal online resource would include references that would allow her to continue to further her own research . There are two types of relevance in Table 4 , relevance to the task / situation and relevance to the location . Relevance to the task refers to evaluating information against the task that prompted the search . The task can evolve as the search continues and new information is found . The other type of relevance included in Table 4 is relevance to the 14 location . This type of relevance relates to finding information specific to your country or local area i . e . localised information . P8 was not specific about how she determined reliability ; however , P8 did state that reliable online resources were often if not always found on the first page of the Google search results Table 4 . As P8 became more familiar with the information resources available for expectant and new mother , she became more confident in her ability to evaluate online resource reliability . She stated that ‘ they are quite standard at this age , and I have found the ones that are okay , you definitely feel okay , that’s quite reliable . ’ In the next section we review the design guidelines developed from P8’s subjective assessment criteria . This includes the three information resource assessment criteria ( convenience , credibility , and format ) and the five information assessment criteria ( complete , easy to understand , references , relevance , and reliability ) . Discussion After a review of the subjective assessment criteria used by P8 during information processing a list of design , guidelines were produced Table 5 . In this case , the design guidelines are based on the information needs of one individual . However , we propose that if the Subjective Assessment Criteria Analysis Tool was used to collect data from a larger sample group , then design guidelines could be produced to meet the information needs of that group . The design guidelines in Table 5 are divided by information resource and information . They are based on the criteria identified in the previous section . Each guideline attempts to highlight a feature that P8 valued or to address an issue that P8 identified . The information resource assessment criteria we identified were convenience , credibility , and format . The email newsletter is a good illustrative example of how information resource design guidelines were created . P8 found that the email newsletter was convenient until she returned to work , 15 and became convenient again when the frequency dropped to monthly when the child turned one . It would have been beneficial if she could have adjusted the frequency herself . Type Criteria Design Guideline Information Resource Convenience Site should be accessible on a wide range of devices . Allow users to change the frequency of push content . Credibility Clearly display the credentials of contributors to the site . Display any personal experience contributors have . Format Consider the size , number and placement of multimedia . The appropriate use of multimedia can be used to enhance a user’s understanding of a topic . Use outlines and summaries to provide an overview of topics . Information Complete Topics should be covered in as much detail as possible . Include a mix of personal stories and expert opinions . Easy to Understand Provide clear , concise information . References Clearly display references for sources . Provide references for users who wish to do additional research on a topic . Relevance Localise information for different regions . Reliability Optimise website design to improve search engine rankings . Table 5 . Design Guidelines The information assessment criteria we identified were complete , easy to understand , references , relevance and reliability , Table 5 . An illustrative example from the information design guidelines is the mix of personal and expert opinions included under the complete section , Table 5 . P8 regularly compared both types of information because while she considered them both credible , they gave her different kinds of viewpoints . If an information resource provided both types of information , then it would be a more complete resource . The number of different information resources categories where P8 referenced a criterion may indicate its importance and , therefore , the importance of the associated design guidelines . As such it should be noted that credibility , complete and easy to understand were all referenced by P8 in three out of five of the information resource categories , more than any other criterion . 16 Conclusion Information use is an important part of information behaviour . However , there has been a lack of both conceptual clarity and empirical research into the area ( Bawden & Robinson , 2012 ; Case & O ' Connor , 2015 ; Niemelä et al . , 2012 ) . This paper brings greater conceptual clarity to the area by proposing that information processing and use is a more accurate term than information use , as it covers both the processing of the information and the internal and behavioural use of the processed information , Figure 3 . Figure 3 . Information Processing and Use Next , this article demonstrates a tool and a series of steps that could be used to address the lack of empirical investigation into information processing , the first phase of information processing and use . We proposed a Subjective Assessment Criteria Analysis Tool , Table 3 , for the collection and analysis of subjective assessment criteria . We used the example of a single participant in an exploratory longitudinal study to show that these criteria can be harnessed to create design guidelines for online information resources . Fourteen design guidelines were produced for P8 , our example participant . The guidelines were based on three information resource criteria ( convenience , credibility , and format ) and five information criteria ( complete , easy to understand , references , relevance , and reliability ) This research uses subjective assessment criteria during information processing to assess information resources and the information contained within . Further investigation is required to understand the impact that those criteria may have on the second phase of information processing and use , information use . We also recognise the influence of other 17 factors on information needs , such as characteristics of the seeker , which we discussed in the methodology section . However , we suggest that if the information processing of a larger population were analysed specifically the subjective assessment criteria , design guidelines could be produced to meet their information needs .
