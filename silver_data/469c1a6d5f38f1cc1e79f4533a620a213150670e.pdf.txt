The first wave witnessed many countries go into strict lockdowns closing schools for long periods of time [ 1 ] . Their reopening has been continuously challenged by successive waves and the need for social distancing restrictions , especially with the emergence of new variants driving rapid case resurgences [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . A rather heterogeneous landscape emerges from how countries worldwide relied on school closure for epidemic control , mainly due to limited understanding of viral circulation in children and their contribution to transmission [ 4 ] . In Europe , depending on the country , students lost from 10 to almost 40 weeks of school from March 2020 to March 2021 due to partial or total school closure ( Figure 1 ) . Outbreaks in schools [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] are difficult to document , as infections in children are mostly asymptomatic [ 7 ] or present mild non - specific symptoms [ 7 ] . Despite the lower susceptibility to infections in children compared to adults [ 8 ] , viral circulation can occur in school settings [ 6 ] , especially in secondary schools [ 9 ] . Accumulating evidence is consistent with increased transmission in the community if schools are in session [ 9 ] – [ 11 ] , and model - based findings suggest that school closure may be used as an additional brake against the COVID - 19 pandemic if other social distancing options are exhausted or undesired [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] . Keeping schools safely open remains a primary objective that goes beyond educational reasons , and pertains to the social and mental development of children [ 14 ] , as well as the reduction of inequalities . Several countries implemented safety protocols at schools , including the use of masks , hand hygiene , staggered arrival and breaks . Regular testing [ 15 ] – [ 17 ] was more recently introduced in educational environments as an additional control measure . Vaccination has been extended to the 12 + population in Europe , and recently boosted by the introduction of sanitary passes in some countries . Yet it is unlikely that schools will be largely vaccinated at the start of the 2021 - 2022 calendar year , while also awaiting the vaccine for children younger than 12 . With the highly contagious Delta variant [ 3 ] rapidly circulating among young age groups , expected scenarios for the upcoming fall may threaten the safety of classrooms . Assessing the conditions of vaccination and regular testing in schools is therefore key to anticipate the safe opening of schools under a variety of possible epidemic contexts . Here , through an agent - based transmission model parameterized on empirical contacts at schools and using field data on adherence to screening in schools , we evaluate different testing protocols under varying immunity profiles of the school population , accounting for age - specific differences in susceptibility to infection , contagiousness , and contact patterns . METHODS Empirical patterns of contacts . We used empirical data describing time - resolved face - to - face proximity contacts between individuals in two educational settings , collected using wearable RFID sensors in a pre - pandemic period . The Primary school dataset describes the contacts among 232 students and 10 teachers during two days in October 2009 in a primary school in Lyon , France [ 18 ] . The school is composed of 5 grades , each of them comprising two classes . The Secondary school dataset describes the contacts between 325 students of 9 different classes during one week in December 2013 in a secondary school in Marseilles , France [ 19 ] . Data collection concerned high school students of the second year of classes specific to the French schooling system , called “classes préparatoires” . These classes gather students for 2 - year studies at the end of the standard curriculum to prepare for entry exams at specific Universities . Classes are divided in three groups , each focusing on a specialization ( mathematics and physics ; physics , chemistry , engineering studies ; biology ) . Datasets are available as lists of contacts over time between anonymized individuals , with a classification by class and in terms of students / teachers . From the raw data , we built the corresponding temporal contact networks , composed of nodes representing individuals , and links representing empirically measured proximity contacts occurring at a given time ( Figure 1 ) . As each dataset covers only a few days , we developed an approach to temporally extend the datasets by generating synthetic networks of contacts that reproduce the main features of the empirical data ( class structures , within - vs . between - classes links , density of links , heterogeneity of contact durations , and similarity of contacts between consecutive days ) . The secondary school synthetic network was further extended to generate a synthetic first year ( to consider the full curriculum of the “classes préparatoires” ) .

The resulting network for the secondary school was composed of 650 students and 18 teachers . Details are provided in the Appendix . Field data on adherence to screening in schools in France . In response to a rising third wave in France in the spring 2021 , authorities started offering the screening at schools on a voluntary basis to limit cases and avoid closures . We used data on adherence to screening collected in 683 schools between March 8 and June 7 , 2021 , in the Auvergne - Rhône - Alpes region of France . Participating schools included different levels : 94 pre - schools , 427 primary schools , 158 middle schools , and 4 high schools , for a total of 209 , 564 students and 18 , 019 personnel . 91 schools ( 13 . 3 % of the total ) participated more than once to the testing , with a maximum of 3 screenings in 5 schools . PCR tests from saliva samples were proposed in pre - schools and primary schools , and self - tests in middle and high schools . This initiative was interrupted in April due to school closures against the third wave , and resumed in early May at reopening . More details on the data are provided in the Appendix . Ethics statement . Contact studies were approved by the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés ( CNIL , the French national body responsible for ethics and privacy ) and school authorities . Informed consent was obtained from participants or their parents if minors . No personal information of participants was associated with the RFID identifier . Testing at school was part of surveillance activities approved by school authorities and proposed with parental consent . Data on adherence to screening were aggregated and anonymized at school level . Transmission model in primary school and secondary school . We developed an agent - based stochastic transmission model for SARS - CoV - 2 infection spreading on the network of contacts . Time progression of the infection in the host is specific to COVID - 19 , including prodromic transmission followed by clinical or subclinical disease stages . We considered individuals in the prodromic and subclinical compartments to be less infectious and to remain undocumented unless tested [ 20 ] . The model is parameterized with age - specific estimates of susceptibility , transmissibility , probability of developing symptoms , and probability to detect a case based on symptoms . A systematic review indicates that minors have lower susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 compared to adults [ 8 ] , but building evidence suggests that high school aged students may be as susceptible as adults [ 6 ] , [ 21 ] . Here we considered a relative susceptibility of 50 % in children and 75 % in adolescents compared to adults , and tested homogeneous susceptibility across age for sensitivity . In presence of symptoms , the probability to recognize a suspect COVID - 19 infection was set to 30 % for students and 50 % for teachers , based on studies indicating that about two thirds of symptomatic children [ 7 ] and half of symptomatic adults [ 22 ] have unrecognized symptoms before diagnosis . These detection rates were varied for sensitivity . We considered a lower transmissibility in children , based on multiple studies suggesting that transmission in children may be less efficient [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . We also explored increased values of relative transmissibility to explore possible changes induced , for example , by the circulation of a novel variant with a higher infectivity on children . Full details on the model are reported in the Appendix . Epidemic contexts and vaccination scenarios . We considered an epidemic scenario for the next fall characterized by an effective reproductive number R = 1 . 3 , 25 % natural immunity in the population , 50 % to 100 % of vaccinated teachers , and 0 to 70 % vaccination coverage in adolescents . R = 1 . 3 corresponds to the value estimated during the second pandemic wave in France . Here , it includes the effectiveness of sanitary protocols ( e . g . , physical distancing , hand hygiene , use of masks ) applied in the school settings to limit viral circulation . We also explored additional values including R = 1 . 1 , R = 1 . 2 ( as estimated during the third wave in France ) , R = 1 . 5 ( as estimated in early - June 2021 in the United Kingdom due to the circulation of the Delta variant ) , and R = 2 ( based on early - July 2021 estimates for the Delta circulation in France ) . Introductions in the school settings are estimated from the community prevalence [ 25 ] . Here we considered one introduction every two weeks ( and explored a range for sensitivity ) , approximately corresponding to the value estimated in January - February 2021 in France . Vaccination is modeled with 95 % effectiveness against infection , 97 % effectiveness against symptomatic disease [ 26 ] , and 50 % effectiveness against transmission [ 27 ] estimated one week after a full cycle of two doses of Pfizer vaccine , the most common one used in France ( > 79 % as of July 21 , 2021 ) . .

Symptom - based testing and case isolation ( ST ) is considered as the basic strategy , present in all protocols , and against which interventions are evaluated . It considers that clinical infections are detected with the estimated probability and tested ; if the result is positive , the case is isolated for 7 days . We tested the following intervention protocols : • Reactive quarantine of the class ( ST + Qc ) : once a case is identified through ST , their class is put in quarantine for 7 days . If quarantined individuals develop symptoms , they remain in isolation for an additional period of 7 days , before returning to school . This protocol is close to the one in place in France before regular testing was deployed . • Reactive quarantine of the class level or specialization ( ST + Ql ) : as the previous protocol , but quarantine is applied to the classes of the same level ( 2 classes in the primary school ) or specialization ( 3 classes in the secondary school ) of the detected case . This option is considered as empirical contact data show a larger mixing between students of the same level ( i . e . of approximately the same age ) , than across different levels , in the primary school ; and analogously for the specialization in the secondary school . • Regular testing with α adherence ( ST + RTα % ) : in addition to symptom - based testing , regular testing is offered to the school and performed at a certain frequency ( once every two weeks , once or twice per week ) . We considered that only a certain percentage α of the non - vaccinated school population will participate to regular testing . Detected cases are isolated without triggering any class closure . • Regular testing with α adherence , and reactive quarantine of the class ( ST + RTα % + Qc ) : in addition to the protocol above , the reactive closure of the class is triggered at every detected case , whether from recognizable symptoms or regular testing . Following protocols adopted in France , we considered PCR testing from saliva samples in the primary school ( test sensitivity of 70 % in the prodromal phase , 80 % in the subclinical phase , and 90 % in the clinical phase [ 28 ] , with a result available after 24h ) and nasal self - testing in the secondary school ( test sensitivity of 50 % , 70 % , and 80 % , respectively , with a result available after 15’ ) . We varied test sensitivity after the prodromal phase between 70 % and 100 % to assess the impact of sampling accuracy ( e . g . samples collected by non - professionals ) . We considered that teachers are required to show proof of a negative PCR test when returning to school after infection . Adherence to regular testing was informed from field data on the testing initiatives in France in the spring 2021 , and then further explored in a range between 10 % and 75 % . Simulation details and analysis . Results for each scenario were obtained from 1 , 000 ( primary school ) to 2 , 000 ( secondary school ) stochastic simulations over the course of a school trimester ( 90 days ) . We computed medians and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) for the quantities of interest . RESULTS Contact networks measured through wearable sensors display a strong community structure around the classes , common to both the primary and secondary schools ( Figure 1 ) . The patterns of interaction , however , vary substantially between the two educational settings . Children have on average a larger number of distinct contacts during a day , interacting with almost their entire class , compared to adolescents establishing links with about one third of their class . Approximately 50 % more links occur between classes than within classes in the primary school , contrary to what observed for adolescents ( 75 % fewer links ) . But accounting for duration , students in both settings spend on average more time interacting within the class than with individuals from other classes . This indicates that the majority of between - classes interactions observed in the primary school are volatile ( e . g . short - duration mixing during breaks ) . Students are also responsible for longer interacting times compared to teachers ( about 64 % longer ) . In a partially immunized school population with 50 % vaccinated teachers , regular testing constitutes an efficient protocol for preventing infections ( Figure 2 ) . It would substantially outperform protocols based on simply identifying cases given recognizable symptoms and additionally closing the class of the detected case , if adherence is large enough . However , the introduction of testing at schools on a voluntary basis during the third wave in France was met with rather heterogeneous participation rates . Adherence of the school population was higher in .

We found that with 50 % of non - vaccinated individuals participating , i . e . approximately the value recorded in the French primary schools , weekly screening would reduce the number of cases by 24 % in the primary school and by 53 % in the secondary school compared to symptom - based testing alone . The case reduction would rise to about 30 % and 70 % in the two schools , respectively , by either increasing adherence to 75 % , or by keeping the same participation ( 50 % ) but increasing the frequency of tests ( twice a week ) . This shows how infection prevention improves with both adherence and frequency of tests , and higher frequency is needed to compensate for lower adherence . However , if the adherence to testing is too low ( 10 % ) , as recorded in the French secondary schools , weekly testing would have a very limited impact , estimated to be < 10 % case reduction . While trends are similar across settings , age - specific contact patterns and epidemiological properties make regular testing more efficient in secondary school . Isolating a case in secondary school indeed prevents a larger number of transmissions compared to what would occur in primary school , because of the larger transmissibility and susceptibility of adolescents . Considering a higher transmissibility of children , possibly due to a newly emerging variant , or a higher susceptibility would lead to similar results in the primary school ( Appendix ) . Findings were robust against changes in detection rates and test sensitivity ( Appendix ) . Larger reproductive numbers would require a higher screening frequency ( Appendix ) . Next to reducing the number of infections , regular testing is able to strongly limit the number of days of absence of students . The quarantine of the class of a detected case implies about 30 to 50 times more student - days lost compared to symptom - based testing alone ( Figure 3 ) . These numbers inevitably increase when additional classes ( of the same grade or specialization ) are closed after detection . Not being sufficiently targeted , the reactive class closure quarantines individuals while their risk of infection remains low . On the other hand , despite detecting more cases , regular testing leads to a small increase in student - days lost , ≤ 6 times the number of days lost with the basic strategy and about 90 % less than the class closure intervention , as isolation is only applied to detected cases . The cost - benefit analysis of Figure 3 shows that for all regular testing strategies , the cost in terms of person - days lost remains low , even when the benefit becomes very high , for a range of different epidemic contexts . Strategies based on class quarantines do not manage to reach a very high benefit , even at large cost . Closing the class at each case detected through regular testing would provide a limited additional benefit in reducing the number of cases , except for very small adherence values ( from 10 % to 50 % case reduction if participation is equal to 10 % as measured in secondary schools in France , Figure 4 ) : as testing is largely underperforming given the low participation , closing the class ensures the isolation of undetected infections . However , this gain is offset by the large increase of absence from school ( about 40 times more days lost per student ) . Benefits and costs of regular testing remain stable when vaccination coverage of teachers increases from 50 % to 100 % , with no observed difference across the two schools ( Figure 5 and Appendix ) . Increasing vaccination coverage in adolescents is a strong protective factor against school outbreaks , so that regular testing becomes less performant in preventing cases as vaccination largely increases . Nonetheless , it would provide an important supplementary control : even with 50 % vaccinated students , weekly self - testing would additionally reduce by almost 20 % the number of cases if half of the non - vaccinated students would self - test , without impacting on school closure . The vaccination level needed to reduce the performance of regular testing to 15 % or below increases with R ( from about 55 % for R = 1 . 3 to 75 % for R = 2 , Appendix ) . DISCUSSION Safely maintaining schools open during the COVID - 19 pandemic is a matter of controversial debate and relatively limited knowledge from the field . As countries in Europe prepare for the start of the next school calendar , school remains a central issue in the midst of vaccine hesitancy , and the rapidly increasing circulation of the Delta variant [ 3 ] . Using empirical data on contacts established in a primary and a secondary school in France , we developed an agent - based transmission model to evaluate different testing strategies in the school setting . For realistic epidemic contexts and immunity profiles of the population , we found that weekly self - testing with large enough adherence provides an optimal balance : it largely improves epidemic control in the school population while avoiding disruptions in the school calendar due to class closures . It also remains essential for infection prevention in situations with zero to moderate vaccination coverage of the student population . .

This requirement was met by the testing initiatives conducted in primary schools in France in the spring 2021 , though many schools only participated once . For testing to work , especially in those settings where the student population is not yet eligible to vaccination , these levels of adherence should be confirmed and possibly improved in the fall 2021 , but most importantly maintained over time with a weekly frequency . We also estimated that the very low adherence recorded in secondary schools in France would be less performant than the previously implemented protocol ( symptom - based testing with isolation of the case and quarantine of the class ) . In the current context of increasing viral circulation due to the Delta variant , preparation for the next school calendar should consider improving strategies for the communication , implementation , and engagement of the school community to considerably improve participation . So far in France , screening at school remained voluntary . As required vaccination for school entry is unlikely to be considered , adaptations of the recently introduced sanitary pass ( requesting either a complete vaccination or a recent negative test ) to the school setting may eventually be envisioned , similarly to other countries where school attendance is constrained to regular screening . In France , criteria for class closures have evolved over time , with the intervention triggered after 1 or 3 detected cases in the same class , depending on the time period . These strategies are , however , very expensive in terms of student - days lost , despite the probability of detecting a case being rather small in younger individuals [ 7 ] . They also have a limited value in epidemic control , as other classes may be already affected due to unobserved introductions from the community or silent spreading within the school . This second effect becomes particularly important when between - classes mixing is higher , as observed in the primary school under study . If efficient regular testing is in place , additionally closing the class after each detected case would provide a small additional advantage to epidemic control if adherence to testing is > 50 % , but it would largely increase absence from school . While regular testing is able to detect more cases than detection based on symptoms , and thus a priori leads to more time spent in isolation per student , it keeps days lost low for two main reasons . First , isolation is only applied to detected cases during their infectious period , thus representing a targeted intervention compared to class quarantine , which is not specific enough . Second , detecting cases that otherwise go unnoticed helps control the epidemic , preventing further diffusion and reducing the overall number of cases generated during a school outbreak . As a consequence , the time spent in isolation is also reduced . This evidence therefore supports the use of weekly self - testing without class closures . Increasing vaccination in teachers will largely protect them from infection and symptomatic disease [ 26 ] , but it yields limited protection for the school population , even under full coverage . This results from the small number of teachers in the school population and the lower rates of contacts they have with students . Despite being specific to the measured contact patterns , these findings were obtained for both school settings and suggest that extending vaccination to eligible students is needed to achieve a collective benefit . Numerical evidence confirms that if coverage is large , outbreak size is already reduced thanks to the vaccination in adolescents . In these conditions , self - testing would bring a supplementary control whose application should be evaluated in light of resources , logistics , adherence , and epidemic conditions . Regular testing remains however critical in low to moderate coverage situations , as it would prevent a substantial portion of undetected infections . This becomes particularly important as incidence rapidly increases in the younger age groups due to the Delta variant , and epidemic scenarios for the upcoming fall highlight the important role of non - vaccinated minors in sustaining SARS - CoV - 2 circulation in the community [ 29 ] . Moreover , preliminary data indicates an imperfect effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing infection and transmission due to the Delta variant [ 28 ] , reinforcing the relevance of regular screening . Self - testing at school could detect silent spreading events and break the chains of transmission , with a direct impact to the school environment , reducing the number of infections and long COVID in children [ 30 ] , and an indirect impact on the community , protecting students’ contacts . This study has a set of limitations . First , it focuses on two school settings for which empirical contact data were available , but contacts in other schools may be different , depending on the structure of curricula and the organization of activities . While precise estimates reported here remain specific to the schools under study , findings on the efficiency of self - testing and vaccination are robust across a range of epidemic conditions and synthetic contact patterns , and can thus inform on the choice of strategies to safely keep schools open . Second , we considered only contacts occurring within the school premises during school hours , but we did not consider .

These contacts may further increase viral circulation in the student population , making vaccination and regular testing at school even more important . Third , the study focuses on school outbreaks and it does not assess the impact that these strategies will have on the viral circulation in the community . In the fall , COVID - 19 epidemic will likely continue to pose a risk to the safe opening of schools . Regular testing remains a key strategy to epidemic control in primary schools , and an important additional support in secondary schools with low or moderate vaccination coverage , all the while minimizing days lost .

School closure in Europe and empirical contact networks in a primary school and a secondary school in France . ( a ) Average number of in - presence school weeks lost by students in Europe because of school closures due to the pandemic . Source : Unesco [ 1 ] . ( b ) , ( c ) Visualization of the empirical temporal contact data aggregated over two days , for the primary ( panel b ) and the secondary ( panel c ) school . Nodes represent teachers and students , each circle represents a class ( each of a different color ) , and links represent contacts , with the thickness coding the contact duration . ( d ) Daily average number of distinct contacts per individual within the same class or in different classes , in the primary and secondary school . Horizontal dashed lines represent the average class size . ( e ) Daily average time that an individual spends in interaction within the same class or in different classes , in the primary and secondary school . ( f ) Daily average time that an individual spends in interaction for teachers and students in the primary school . In the three bottom panels , histogram bars refer to the empirical networks . Points and error bars refer to the synthetic networks ( errors represent 95 % confidence intervals ) . In panels d and e for the secondary school , there is an increase of average number of contacts and their duration in the synthetic networks compared to their empirical counterparts , due to the ad hoc addition of contacts between school years . In panel f , only values from the synthetic networks are shown , as teachers did not participate to the data collection , and their contact behavior was inferred from another dataset ( see Methods ) . .

Efficiency of regular testing in educational environments . ( a ) Number of schools participating to the screening initiative during the third wave in France , according to school level ( pre - school , primary school , middle school , and high school ) . ( b ) Predicted percentage of reduction in the number of cases achieved by each intervention protocol with respect to the basic strategy of the symptom - based testing ( ST ) in the primary school . Intervention protocols are : symptom - based testing and case isolation , with reactive quarantine of the class ( ST + Qc ) ; symptom - based testing and case isolation , with reactive quarantine of the class level ( ST + Ql ) ; symptom - based testing and case isolation , coupled with regular testing with a percentage of adherence ( ST + RTα % ) , with α = 10 % , 50 % , and 75 % . For regular testing , different frequencies are shown : one test every two weeks , a weekly test , two tests per week . Error bars correspond to 95 % confidence intervals . The empty marker corresponds to the adherence estimated from empirical data recorded in schools of that level ( from panel d ) . ( c ) As in panel b , for the secondary school . ( d ) Estimated adherence to screening recorded in the different school levels participating to the screening initiative in the third wave in France . Error bars correspond to 95 % confidence intervals . ( e ) Probability distribution of the simulated final epidemic size in the primary school for selected protocols at the end of the trimester . Regular testing is done with weekly frequency . ( f ) As in panel e , for the secondary school . .

Impact of increasing vaccination coverage . ( a ) Predicted percentage of reduction in the number of cases achieved by selected protocols as a function of the vaccination coverage in teachers in the secondary school . The case reduction is computed relatively to the basic strategy ( symptom - based testing , ST ) . ( b ) Predicted percentage of reduction in the number of cases achieved by intervention protocols as a function of the median epidemic size in the secondary school . The case reduction is computed relatively to the basic strategy ( symptom - based testing , ST ) . Dots of the same protocol for different vaccination coverage are clustered together . ( c ) Predicted increase in student - days lost for selected protocols as a function of the vaccination coverage in teachers in the secondary school . The increase in days lost is computed relatively to the basic strategy ( symptom - based testing , ST ) . ( d ) Predicted percentage of reduction in the number of cases achieved by selected protocols as a function of the vaccination coverage in adolescents in the secondary school . The case reduction is computed relatively to the basic strategy ( symptom - based testing , ST ) . ( e ) Predicted total epidemic size at the end of the trimester vs . the vaccination coverage in adolescents in the secondary school in selected protocols . ( f ) Predicted increase in student - days lost for selected protocols as a function of the vaccination coverage in adolescents in the secondary school . The increase in days lost is computed relatively to the basic strategy ( symptom - based testing , ST ) . The 50 % and 70 % data - points are not shown as the median student - days lost for ST is equal to zero ( the likelihood of generating a clinical infection among the pupils - recognizable on the basis of the symptoms - becomes low with increasing vaccination coverage ) . In all panels , the empty markers and bars correspond to the adherence estimated from empirical data recorded in schools of that level . .
