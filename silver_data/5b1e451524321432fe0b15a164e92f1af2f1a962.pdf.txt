Introduction One of the principal features of the eukaryotic cell that distin - guishes it from prokaryotic cell is complex endocytic system . According to the current view , the role of this system in evo - lution lies in its impact on actuation of the eukaryotic cell plan ( Sigismund et al . 2012 ) . Furthermore , during eukaryote evo - lution endocytic system appeared as a platform and central organizer for such cellular pathways as intracellular transport and signal transduction . In animal cells endocytosis is essential for internalization of activated receptors and regulation of signaling , maintenance of plasma membrane ( PM ) homeosta - sis , as well as cell type – speciﬁc functions ranging from synaptic transmission to antigen presentation ( Sigismund et al . 2012 ) . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is a universal internal - ization route in eukaryotes ( Samaj et al . 2005 ; Macro et al . 2012 ; Adung’a et al . 2013 ; Field et al . 2007 ) and the best - studied endocytic pathway to date . The biochemistry of CME is much better understood in animals than in other eukaryotes ( Kirchhausen et al . 2014 ) . Initiation of CME starts with the recruitment of the adaptor protein 2 complex ( AP2 ) complex and clathrin chains to the PM ( Cocucci et al . 2012 ) . Speciﬁc cargoes designated for internalization via CME are recruited to the nascent clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) either by AP2 or cla - thrin - associated sorting proteins ( CLASPs ) ( Traub and Bonifacino 2013 ) . Transition of AP2 to the open conformation is required to dock clathrin to molecular cargoes at PM and is regulated via interactions with PM , cargo ( Owen et al . 2004 ) , and the FEI functional complex ( Hollopeter et al . 2014 ; Umasankar et al . 2014 ) . Components of the FEI complex— FCHO ( Fer / Cip4 homology domain - only protein ) , Eps15 ( epi - dermal growth factor receptor substrate 15 ) , and ITSN GBE (cid:2) The Author 2016 .

Increase in CCP membrane curvature is mediated by mem - brane - bending accessory proteins and clathrin polymerization . The clathrin lattice around the endocytic membrane supports its deformation and deﬁnes the size of the vesicle ( Kirchhausen et al . 2014 ) . Late CME stages that precede ves - icle ﬁssion require the sorting nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) protein for con - version of CCP to a deeply invaginated structure and remodeling of the vesicle neck ( Posor et al . 2013 ) . The GTPase dynamin ( DNM ) forms a ring at the neck of CCV and mediates vesicle ﬁssion from the PM . Late stages of in - vagination and ﬁssion are supported by the network of actin ﬁlaments ( McMahon and Boucrot 2011 ; Kirchhausen et al . 2014 ) . After vesicle ﬁssion , the clathrin lattice is disassembled by uncoating proteins providing recycled proteins for the next cycles of endocytosis . CME is highly integrated with other cellular processes , in particular signal transduction , protein sorting , secretion , and degradation ( Traub 2009 ; McMahon and Boucrot 2011 ) . Despite extensive investigation of CME over the last three decades , a number of fundamental questions still remain . What is the very basis of CME that could be observed in extant eukaryotes ? To what extent are the CME of animals and yeast related regarding the latter as widely used model for CME studies ? How was CME linked to other cellular pro - cesses , in particular signaling ? These questions could be an - swered by reconstruction of CME evolution . Advances over the past decade in genome sequencing have led to the elab - oration of comparative and evolutionary studies in molecular and cell biology . The availability of complete genomes and proteomes allowed the investigation of evolutionary changes in proteins and their families ; however , what is more intrigu - ing is the possibility of evolutionary reconstructions of cellular pathways and systems . To date , several reports described the evolutionary histories of individual endocytic proteins ( Wakeham et al . 2005 ; Traub 2009 ; De Craene et al . 2012 ; Purkanti and Thattai 2015 ) or the distribution of several CME components in eukaryotes ( Field et al . 2007 ) . Yet , however , reconstruction of evolution of the CME process is still missing . In this work , comparative proteo - mic studies were used to analyze how the molecular machinery of CME was modiﬁed during eukaryote evolution on the way to animals . We searched for “waves of emergence , ” functional subsets of proteins speciﬁc for large taxonomic groups , and investigated how the molecular basis for certain endocytic fea - tures was developed . To this end phylogenetic analysis was combined with functional data reported previously . Here we provide data on the evolutionary history of CME typical of animals . We traced the emergence of essential an - imal endocytic proteins and their modiﬁcations during evolu - tion of eukaryotes from the last eukaryotic common ancestor ( LECA ) to metazoans . The role of these evolutionary events is discussed in relation to their possible impact on the mecha - nism of CME , thereby shaping endocytosis to that observed in extant animals , particularly in mammals . Materials and Methods Search for Homologs of Endocytic Proteins One hundred ﬁfty - one reference proteomes of eukaryotic or - ganisms were fetched from the Broad Institute ( www . broad - institute . org , last accessed August 16 , 2015 ) databases ( Fonticula alba , Thecamonas trahens , Sphaeroforma arctica , Monosiga brevicolis , Capsaspora owczarzaki ) and UniProt ( http : / / www . uniprot . org / , last accessed August 16 , 2015 ) ( the other organisms ) . To ﬁnd potential homologs of animal endocytic proteins , we ﬁrst constructed Hidden Markov Models ( HMMs ) for each of the 35 endocytic proteins using HMMER ( Finn et al . 2011 ) on the basis of the multiple se - quence alignment produced by Clustal Omega ( Sievers et al . 2011 ) . We used sampling of four model organisms , Ciona intestinalis , Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila melanogaster , and Homo sapiens , that represent diversity in the metazoan group . The HMMs obtained were used as a query to search for homologous endocytic proteins in the proteomes with a se - quence inclusion e - value threshold of 0 . 01 and domain inclu - sion threshold value of 0 . 01 as recommended by HMMER . Then we checked the domain architecture of the forward search hits . Protein domains were predicted with HMMER using curated domain models from Pfam 28 . 0 release ( Finn et al . 2014 ) or Prosite ( http : / / prosite . expasy . org / , last accessed September 4 , 2015 ) . Coiled - coil regions were predicted with ncoils ( Lupas et al . 1991 ) . We selected only the hits with domain architecture typical of animal proteins that scored ﬁrst corresponding to human homologs of the endocytic pro - teins during reciprocal search against the human proteome . In the case of distant proteins , that is , clathrin in Euglenozoa , we selected the forward search hits that had typical domain architectures . Accession numbers of the homologs identiﬁed for each endocytic component throughout the eukaryotes together with e - values for the forward HMMER search for these hits are listed in supplementary table S1 , Supplementary Material online . Prediction and analysis were automated using Python scripts that are available online ( http : / / github . com / yklsorok / prot _ evol _ toolkit ) . Prediction of Protein Interaction Motifs Motifs that potentially bind core endocytic proteins were pre - dicted using regular expressions : DP [ WF ] j F . D . F j WV . F j F . F . [ FL ] for AP2 binding ( Praefcke et al . 2004 ) , L [ FILMV ] . [ FILMV ] [ DE ] j L [ FILMV ] . [ DE ] [ FILMV ] for clathrin binding ( Dell’Angelica 2001 ; Lafer 2002 ) , and asparagine - proline - phe - nylalanine motif ( NPF ) for Eps15 homology ( EH ) domain bind - ing . For all motifs predicted in CLASPs , we counted the Evolution of Endocytosis GBE Genome Biol . Evol . 8 ( 3 ) : 588 – 606 . doi : 10 . 1093 / gbe / evw028 Advance Access publication February 12 , 2016 589 occurrence of each motif in the phylum as the number of organisms that have the motif in the corresponding protein divided by the total number of organisms in the phylum . We also counted the median occurrence of each motif in the phylum as the median of motif counts for all proteins in the phylum that contain the corresponding motif ( supplementary table S8 , Supplementary Material online ) . We took into ac - count only motifs in the protein “tails , ” C - terminal regions lacking globular domains , and in the case of stonin ( STON ) we counted the motifs in the N - terminal region . To predict AP2 - activating region ( APA ) motifs , we gener - ated the HMM proﬁle using the APA motifs of H . sapiens , Mus musculus , and Ca . elegans FCHO homologs that were exper - imentally shown to bind AP2 ( Hollopeter et al . 2014 ) and performed a search in proteomes of eukaryotes using HMMer . Generation of the CME Protein Interaction Network Binary protein – protein interactions between CME compo - nents were obtained from the BioGrid ( http : / / thebiogrid . org / , last accessed June 8 , 2015 ) and MINT ( http : / / mint . bio . uniroma2 . it / mint / , last accessed June 8 , 2015 ) databases . The binding data obtained were ﬁltered to remove those resulting from high throughput analyses , colocalizations , cofractionations , and two - hybrid screens . Therefore only binding of proteins detected by afﬁnity puriﬁcation of pro - tein complexes , protein - fragment complementation assays , reconstituted protein complexes in vitro , Far Western blot - ting , and biochemical activity was considered . The protein - interaction network of CME was visualized with Cytoscape ( www . cytoscape . org / , last accessed December 1 , 2014 ) . Tree Construction and Sequence Analysis Multiple sequence alignments were generated by the Clustal Omega algorithm . Maximum - likelihood analysis was per - formed using the RaxML 8 . 1 . 3 software ( Stamatakis 2014 ) with 100 bootstrap replicates using the computational cluster of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics NASU ( Salnikov et al . 2009 ) . Phylogenetic trees were visualized by Dendroscope 3 ( http : / / dendroscope . org , last accessed October 1 , 2014 ) ( Huson and Scornavacca 2012 ) . Sequence logos were generated with WebLogo application ( http : / / weblogo . berkeley . edu , last accessed October 2 , 2015 ) ( Crooks et al . 2004 ) . Visualization of multiple sequence align - ments was performed by ESPript 3 . 0 ( http : / / espript . ibcp . fr , last accessed October 2 , 2015 ) ( Robert and Gouet 2014 ) . Three - Dimensional Modeling of AP2 Multimodular Complexes Three - dimensional ( 3D ) models of AP2 complexes of fungus and chromalveolata were obtained by Modeller ( Sali and Blundell 1993 ) using the crystal structure of the Rattus norve - gicus AP2 complex ( PDB code : 4UQI ) ( Kelly et al . 2014 ) as template . Missing residues located at disordered loops in chains alpha , beta , and mu were generated and included in the 4UQI template structure by loop modeling as provided by Modeller . The AP2 protein sequences of Blastocystis hominis and Cryptococcus cinerea were obtained from the NCBI GenBank . Pairwise sequence alignments were produced using Clustal Omega and formatted manually according to the syntax of Modeller * . ali ﬁles . Ensembles of 20 multichain models were generated and the best models were selected by the smallest value of normalized discrete optimized protein energy score for further analysis . To check Modeller scores independently , we used the MolProbity suite ( Chen et al . 2010 ) that allowed to perform a comprehensive analysis of protein structure , residue by residue , and calculates the score using the statistical potential and physics - based approaches . Superposition and visualization of 3D structures was per - formed by PyMOL ( Schro¨dinger 2010 ) . Results Emergence of Endocytic Components Typical of Animals and Organization of an Endocytic Protein Interaction Network To follow transformation of CME components from LECA to metazoans , we selected 35 proteins essential for vesicle forma - tion and cargo internalization in animals ( McMahon and Boucrot 2011 ; Kirchhausen et al . 2014 ) . Certainly , the list of CME pro - teins assembled was a reduction of the known complexity , but this approach allowed us to disclose basic CME components and their functional links escaping abundant data . Furthermore , we investigated the distribution of selected CME proteins across eukaryotes to infer the possible time of their emergence . To address questions of emergence and evolution of CME components we used systematics recently upgraded by Cavalier - Smith group ( Cavalier - Smith et al . 2014 ) . The eukary - otic evolutionary tree was regarded as two supergroups , Bikonta and Unikonta . The ﬁrst supergroup comprised Archaeplastida ( plants and algae ) and Chromista ( strameno - piles , alveolates , rhizarians , etc . ) branches as well the earliest deducible eukaryotic branches , Excavata and Euglenozoa . The second supergroup encompassed Amoebozoa ( amoebas and slime molds ) and Opisthokonta ( fungi , animals , and related organisms ) , the latter of which ﬁnally gave raise to extant Metazoa . We focused our attention on representatives of Unikonta and moved along the eukaryotic tree toward ani - mals identifying common conserved features and emerging ones . Within Unikonta there were several taxa on the way to animals : Obazoa , Opisthokonta , Holozoa , and Metazoa . Extant animals , Metazoa , together with related unicellular Choanozoa formed Holozoa group . Furthermore , Fungi , re - lated Nucleariidae and Holozoa belonged to the Opisthokonta branch . Nicleariidae was considered close to the root of the branch . Apusozoa branched before common ancestor of Opisthokonta and together they comprised Obazoa . Dergai et al . GBE 590 Genome Biol .

The search of proteins homologous to animal endocytic components was automated using Python scripts for the 151 proteomes representing all major eukaryotic branches ( supplementary table S1 , Supplementary Material online ) . We tried to balance taxonomic groups to provide maximal coverage and diversity within groups and avoid oversampling certain groups , for example , mammals over worms and there - fore bias . The HMMs were constructed from sequence align - ments of Ci . intestinalis , Ca . elegans , D . melanogaster , and H . sapiens endocytic proteins . Hits with the same domain archi - tecture as in animals were run as reciprocal query against the human proteome . The criterium to assign an identiﬁed hit as a homolog of an animal protein was the requirement for it as reciprocal best hit . Best reciprocal hits representing proteins conserved within certain taxons with partially similar domain architectures were considered as putative analogs or ancestors F IG . 1 . — Continued asterisks .

Identiﬁed homologs of the animal endocytic proteins were further analyzed for structural features with reported functional roles . Our data showed that a subset of 22 CME proteins was widely distributed throughout eukaryotes ( ﬁg . 1 A ) . The re - maining 13 endocytic proteins were gradually incorporated into the CME machinery during evolution of eukaryotes from LECA to Metazoa . The actin cytoskeleton regulator Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) was found in Unikonta and could link the process of actin polymerization to mem - brane deformation and vesicle ﬁssion . In Obazoa , two mem - brane - deforming proteins with BAR domains ( Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs domain ) were documented , SNX9 and AMPH ( amphiphysin ) . Distinctive features of SNX9 from other sorting nexins are the N - terminal Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain that mediates protein – protein interactions and speciﬁc BAR domain , classiﬁed by Pfam service as WASP - bind - ing BAR domain . AMPH has the same domain organization as SH3GL ( SH3 domain GRB2 - like ) found in LECA ; however , AMPH is capable of binding to endocytic hubs AP2 and cla - thrin as well as producing and “sensing” higher degrees of PM curvature than SH3GL ( Peter et al . 2004 ) . Later , in the Opisthokonta the FEI functional network considered as es - sential organizer of early CME stages in animals and fungi ( Weinberg and Drubin 2012 ; Hollopeter et al . 2014 ) was documented . In this taxon , subgroup of CLASPs , endocytic proteins that recruit speciﬁc types of cargoes to nascent CCPs expanded . Late CME components , DNM and CTTN ( cortactin ) ( Cao et al . 2003 ; Lundmark and Carlsson 2004 ) , that contribute to CCV ﬁssion have been found since Holozoa ( ﬁg . 1 A ) . To conceive changes in CME upon emergence of novel components from LECA to Metazoa , we generated Protein Interaction Network ( PIN ) based on previously re - ported biochemical data deposited in the Biogrid and MINT databases ( ﬁg . 1 B ) . Endocytic proteins were allo - cated within PIN according to their function either in ves - icle formation or recruitment of a particular cargo . As a result three groups with distinct properties were ob - served . Endocytic accessory proteins emerged relatively early during evolution of eukaryotes and formed redun - dant interconnections within their group . The majority of CLASPs that represent a more recent evolutionary inno - vation were isolated from each other and from accessory proteins . In addition to their role in vesicle formation , the accessory proteins Eps15 , EPN ( epsin ) , CALM ( clathrin as - sembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein ) , AP180 ( cla - thrin coat assembly protein AP180 ) , AGFG ( Arf - GAP domain and FG repeat - containing protein ) , and FCHO also participated in cargo recognition ( Traub and Bonifacino 2013 ) . Interaction between these groups was mediated by three hubs : AP2 , clathrin , and the FEI pro - teins . Therefore during evolution endocytic machinery gained group of sorting proteins and an additional endo - cytic interaction hub with a functional role similar to AP2 in integration accessory and sorting components . Many CME components are represented by families of paralogous proteins in mammals . We analyzed the timing and the extent of duplication of genes encoding endocytic proteins . Paralogous expansion of these genes occurred in a common ancestor of vertebrates ( ﬁg . 1 C and supplementary table S3 , Supplementary Material online ) apparently during the last whole genome duplication ( Smith et al . 2013 ) . Therefore 60 % of endocytic components in vertebrates have paralogs in contrast to 12 % observed in invertebrates . Noteworthy is that a tendency of decrease in the number of paralogs for each endocytic component was observed in tet - rapods compared with ﬁsh . Thus , in addition to the subset of endocytic proteins found in LECA , novel CME components were added during evolu - tion implying modiﬁcation of endocytic PIN . Since vertebrates , the majority of endocytic components have been represented by several proteins due to massive paralogous expansion of endocytic genes . Eps15 and ITSN Are Opisthokont - Specific Variants of Conserved Endocytic EEC Proteins One of the ﬁrst documented “waves of emergence” of endocytic components was the acquisition in opisthokonts of three functionally linked proteins , FCHO , Eps15 and ITSN , that constitute the FEI functional complex ( Henne et al . 2010 ; Mayers et al . 2013 ) . The adaptor proteins Eps15 and ITSN possess multiple protein - interaction do - mains and by hetero - oligomerization provide large scaf - folding for assembly of early endocytic complexes . To trace the evolutionary history of these proteins typical of the opisthokonts , we searched for domain architectures from which Eps15 and ITSN could originate , in particular EEC , SH3 - SH3 , DH - PH , and DH - PH - C2 in proteomes rep - resenting major eukaryotic branches . The EEC domain architecture that represented the N - termi - nal region of Eps15 and ITSN was the most conserved domain combination studied throughout eukaryotes ( ﬁg . 2 and sup - plementary table S4 , Supplementary Material online ) . In eu - karyotes beyond opisthokonts , the EEC is a protein without additional globular domains according to the annotations of PROSITE , SMART , and Pfam . EEC proteins could be found in all major eukaryotic branches except in the Euglenozoa , a taxon that completely lacks EH domains . Low occurrence of EEC proteins in proteomes in comparison with other domain architectures studied ( e . g . , SH3 - SH3 , DH - PH ) together with conservation across eukaryotes suggested speciﬁc functions for these proteins . In opisthokonts , EEC - containing proteins have speciﬁc C - terminal domains . Eps15 has ubiquitin - binding regions , ITSN has multiple SH3 domains together with a DH - PH - C2 extension , and Reps possesses a RalA binding protein Dergai et al . GBE 594 Genome Biol . Evol . 8 ( 3 ) : 588 – 606 . doi : 10 . 1093 / gbe / evw028 Advance Access publication February 12 , 2016 domain . We assumed that the EEC proteins of primitive eu - karyotes could be ancestors of EEC - containing Eps15 , ITSN , and Reps molecules in animals . Phylogenetic analysis of Eps15 homologs using the maxi - mum likelihood ( ML ) method revealed two clusters of proteins corresponding to fungal and metazoan branches which dif - fered in the type of ubiquitin - binding domains , ubiquitin - as - sociated domain ( UBA ) or ubiquitin - interacting motif ( UIM ) ( ﬁg . 3 A ) . Thus , the ability to recognize ubiquitinated proteins was acquired by Eps15 homologs independently in the fungal and metazoan branches as a result of convergent evolution suggesting an essential role of Eps15 in recognizing ubiquiti - nated proteins , particularly endocytic cargoes , both in fungi and metazoans . Homologs of ITSN were clustered into three major clades according to the ML tree ( ﬁg . 3 B ) . Two clades included fungi and animals with choanozoans . The third clade represented primitive fungi and the nucleariid F . alba that are considered closely related to the phylogenetic root of opisthokonts ( Paps et al . 2013 ) . The domain architecture of ITSN proteins found in the third clade was assumed as primeval for this protein . It includes all the typical domains of animal ITSN except for three additional SH3 domains gained in holozoans . Loss of various ITSN domains ( the EH and C2 domains ) in different fungal taxa ( ﬁg . 3 B ) and gain of a WASP - homology 2 domain domain involved in actin binding could reﬂect alterations of its role in an advanced fungal group . Among all ITSN proteins the DH - PH tandem implicated in regulation of the small GTPase Cdc42 activity is the most invariant part throughout opistho - konts , suggestive of its important role . Thus , in opisthokonts conserved EEC proteins acquired ad - ditional functional regions for cargo recognition as well as for interactions with endocytic components , PM and actin cyto - skeleton regulators .

Evol . 8 ( 3 ) : 588 – 606 . doi : 10 . 1093 / gbe / evw028 Advance Access publication February 12 , 2016 homology domain ( FCH ) domain and a protein - binding mu ho - mology domain ( muHD ) . This protein plays an essential role in initiation of CME by clustering AP2 ( Henne et al . 2010 ) and contributing to its conformational switch and activation in ani - mals ( Hollopeter et al . 2014 ) The search for FCHO ancestors revealed that the FCH domain was not typical of bikonts , whereas in unikonts this domain was a structural part of mul - tiple proteins ( ﬁg . 2 ) . ML analysis of FCH domains produced a phylogenetic tree with low bootstrap support values ( supple - mentary ﬁg . S1 A , Supplementary Material online ) . Poor differ - entiation of FCHO structures prevented us from deﬁning phylogenetic relationships between various FCH domains . In contrast to the FCH domains , muHD domains were widely dis - tributed throughout eukaryotes ( ﬁg . 2 ) . In the phylogenetic tree , muHD domains formed distinctive clades that corresponded to AP1 – AP5 complexes , COPI ( coat protein I ) , and the muniscin family ( supplementary ﬁg . S1 B , Supplementary Material online ) . In the latter , clade sequences of fungal and animal muniscins clustered with two muHD - containing proteins of Bikonts , the plant Arabidopsis thaliana ( TML ) and the excavate Naegleria gruberi . The role of the plant muniscin - like protein TML was reported in CME as a component of the plant - speciﬁc endocytic TPLATE complex ( Gadeyne et al . 2014 ) . Thus , based on struc - ture – functional data , the muHD - containing protein found in excavates could be considered a predecessor of muniscins . Phylogenetic analyses of FCHO homologs demonstrated two clades in the ML tree that corresponded to holozoan and fungal branches ( ﬁg . 4 A ) . We analyzed FCHO homologs for the presence of the AP2 - activating ( APA ) region reported in animals . The HMM proﬁle generated using APA motifs of human , mouse , and nematode FCHO homologs ( Hollopeter et al . 2014 ) was used to search in proteomes of eukaryotes using HMMer ( http : / / hmmer . janelia . org / , last accessed May 1 , 2015 ) . The data obtained demonstrated that sequences cor - responding to the APA motif are unique of holozoan FCHO proteins , whereas fungal homologs as well as plant TML lack this region ( ﬁg . 4 B and C ) . In primitive fungi , a conserved region of 15 amino acid residues similar to the beginning of the APA motif was found ( ﬁg . 4 C ) ; however , it was not suf - ﬁcient for the function of APA ( Umasankar et al . 2014 ) . Thus , the functional APA region apparently was acquired in FCHO homologs of holozoans . The APA region of FCHO facilitates the closed - open con - formational switch of the AP2 complex ( Hollopeter et al . 2014 ) . We suggest that emergence of the APA motif in holozoans accompanied structural changes in AP2 that led to the closed conformation requiring a speciﬁc activator . A number of point mutations in the AP2 subunits each rendered the conformational switch of the complex less dependent on activation by the APA motif ( Hollopeter et al . 2014 ) . We asked whether such substitutions could be observed in AP2 subunits of fungi and other eukaryotes that lack the APA motif in FCHO . To probe this we used fungi as closest relatives of holozoans . Analysis of the group comprising all other eukary - otes except opisthokonts could answer the question of whether the presence / absence of amino acid substitutions in fungal AP2 was typical of all eukaryotes beyond holozoans . As expected , most residues reported as essential for the closed AP2 conformation ( Hollopeter et al . 2014 ) were con - served throughout eukaryotes ( supplementary ﬁg . S2 and table S5 , Supplementary Material online ) . However , conserved residues in positions 195 ( m 195 ) and 306 ( m 306 ) of the mu subunit as well as 451 ( a 451 ) of the alpha subunit were dis - tinct between holozoans and other eukaryotes . These differ - ences resembled point mutations that impaired closed conformation of AP2 in worms ( Hollopeter et al . 2014 ) and therefore attracted our attention . Other residues conserved in holozoans , m 290 , m 298 , m 378 , and m 379 , were variable in other eukaryotes . Structural superposition of the resolved R . norvegicus AP2 complex ( 4UQI ) and the generated models of the fungal Cr . cinerea and chromalveolata B . hominis AP2 complexes in closed conformation ( supplementary ﬁle S1 , Supplementary Material online ) was used to deduce contacts of residues m 306 ( ﬁg . 5 A ) , a 451 ( ﬁg . 5 B ) , and m 195 ( ﬁg . 5 C ) . The residues involved in the identiﬁed contacts were conserved in holozo - ans , whereas in fungi and other eukaryotes these residues were variable or distinct and contacts were hindered in AP2 complexes of Cr . cinerea and B . hominis . The contact between the alpha and mu subunits ( ﬁg . 5 A ) is supported in rat AP2 by hydrophobic and electrostatic inter - actions that include residues conserved in holozoans , m 306 and m 290 . In rat , AP2 hydrophobic association of the m V306 / a L426 and m I290 / a I430 pairs as well as electrostatic contacts of the m K308 / a E422 and a K434 / m E302 pairs were observed ( ﬁg . 5A , left panel ) . In fungi and other eukaryotes , the absence of hydrophobic interactions did not stabilize con - tacts between charged residues ( ﬁg . 5A , middle and right F IG . 5 . — Continued F IG . 5 . — Aminoacidresiduessupportinginter - andintramolecular contacts ofAP2subunits .

Within the alpha subunit of rat AP2 , the proximity of con - served a R451 / a E414 residues provided juxtaposition of alpha helices ( ﬁg . 5B , left panel ) in the closed AP2 conformation , whereas in the open state the distance between these resi - dues increased . In fungi and other eukaryotes , residues in cor - responding positions are not conserved ( ﬁg . 5B , middle and right panels ) indicating a lack of this intramolecular contact . Hydrophobic interaction of the proximally located con - served m H195 / m A242 residues was observed within the mu subunit of rat AP2 ( ﬁg . 5C , left panel ) , whereas in other eu - karyotes negatively charged residues in corresponding posi - tions ( ﬁg . 5C , middle and right panels ) apparently created repulsive forces . Our data suggest that in holozoans , conservation of resi - dues distinct from those in other eukaryotes contributed to the closed conformation of the AP2 complex that required a speciﬁc activator , the APA motif of the FCHO protein . Development of Cargo Selection during Evolution of CME To couple various cargoes destined for internalization with the endocytic machinery , adaptor proteins such as the AP2 com - plex and speciﬁc sorting proteins are required ( Traub 2009 ) . Although the AP2 complex is ubiquitous in eukaryotes , differ - ent CLASPs were gained sequentially during evolution ( ﬁg . 1A ) . To investigate how the interface between the vesicle - forming machinery and cargoes evolved , we focused on the evolutionary history of known CLASPs . We analyzed the pres - ence and conservation of features essential for CLASPs’ func - tion : Cargo - binding regions and linear recognition motifs for endocytic interaction hubs and accessory proteins . CALM and ARRB ( arrestin beta ) were found in most eu - karyotic supergroups suggesting their presence in LECA ( ﬁg . 6 A ) . The cargo - binding AP180 N - terminal homology do - main of CALM was highly conserved across eukaryotes ( ﬁg . 6 A , left panel ) as well as residues ( Miller et al . 2011 ) involved in soluble NSF attachment protein receptor ( SNARE ) binding ( supplementary table S6 , Supplementary Material online ) . CALM homologs of Euglenozoa , the earliest branch of eukaryotes , lacked clathrin - and AP2 - binding motifs . Given that clathrin of euglenozoans is very distant from its animal homolog ( supplementary table S1 , Supplementary Material online ) , cargo sorting in this taxon could involve distinct inter - action motifs and scenarios . Poor conservation of CALM was observed in chromists , whereas in other eukaryotic branches this protein became highly conserved and acquired additional contacts with the endocytic machinery due to gain of AP2 - binding sites and NPFs . In vertebrates , the paralogous AP180 protein emerged ( ﬁg . 6 A , left , upper row ; supplementary ﬁg . S3 , Supplementary Material online ) with localization restricted to neurons and specialized functions in synaptic vesicle recycling ( Yao et al . 2002 ) . Another sorting protein that was suggested to have emerged in LECA was ARRB ; however , its decay or complete loss was observed in most eukaryotic branches except Excavata and Holozoa ( ﬁg . 6 A , right ) . The AP2 - binding motif typical of animal ARRBs that contributes to receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Zhang et al . 1997 ) was found in holozoan ARRB homologs only . In spite of the lack of detectable ARRB homologs in certain taxa , G - protein cou - pled receptor ( GPCRs ) could be found across all eukaryotic branches ( de Mendoza et al . 2014 ) . Notable , in animals ARRBs mediate fast internalization of GPCRs , while slow uptake mechanism independent of ARRBs and clathrin was also reported here ( Koppen and Van Jakobs 2004 ) . Presumably , in eukaryotic branches lacking ARRBs endocytosis of GPCRs is mediated via alternative internalization routes . The accessory proteins EPN , Eps15 ( EEC beyond opistho - konts ) , and AGFG were highly conserved endocytic compo - nents ; however , in early branched eukaryotes they did not contain cargo - binding regions ( ﬁg . 6 B ) . The homologs of EPN and Eps15 gained the ability to recognize ubiquitinated cargoes via UBA and UIM regions in opisthokonts . A speciﬁc region to have recruited SNAREs ( Pryor et al . 2008 ) has been found in AGFG homologs since metazoans ( ﬁg . 6 B , right panel ; supplementary table S7 , Supplementary Material online ) . The increase in the number of linear motifs in these CLASPs on the way to animals ( supplementary table S8 , Supplementary Material online ) was documented . Sorting proteins that emerged in metazoans were built on the basis of either cargo - binding phosphotyrosine - binding domain ( PTB ) domains of signaling proteins ( such as for DAB [ disabled homolog ] and NUMB [ protein numb homolog ] ) or the muHD domain of the AP2mu subunit ( such as for STON ) ( ﬁg . 6C ) . These proteins immediately possessed regions nec - essary for cargo recognition and interaction with endocytic proteins . Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia homologs ( ARH ) had poorly conserved binding sites for clathrin and AP2 in animals and completely lacked these motifs in the early branch , the choanozoans . Thus , LECA possessed sorting proteins essential for engage - ment of cargoes necessary for vesicle fusion and signal trans - duction processes . Starting from opisthokonts , endocytic accessory proteins gained ability of cargo recruitment via ac - quisition of cargo - binding regions . The most evolutionary recent CLASPs speciﬁc of metazoans were based on domains typical of signaling pathways . Emergence of DNM as a Central Regulator of Late Endocytic Stages The late stage of CME requires constriction of the vesicle neck , recruitment of the DNM GTPase , and coordinated polymeri - zation of actin to promote vesicle scission ( Lundmark and Carlsson 2004 ; Shin et al . 2008 ) .

Evol . 8 ( 3 ) : 588 – 606 . doi : 10 . 1093 / gbe / evw028 Advance Access publication February 12 , 2016 599 According to our results ( supplementary table S1 , Supplementary Material online ) and previously published data ( Liu et al . 2012 ) , homologs of DNM were found only in holozoans . In other eukaryotic branches dynamin - related pro - teins ( DRPs ) lacking the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain and prolin - rich C - terminal tail were found ( ﬁg . 7 A and supplemen - tary table S2 , Supplementary Material online ) . We followed transformation of DRP to DNM analyzing its key functional regions . The three crucial interfaces for dimer and tetramer formation ( Reubold et al . 2015 ) were highly similar in DRP and DNM across eukaryotes ( ﬁg . 7 B and supplementary table S9 , Supplementary Material online ) . However , DNM had a speciﬁc interaction interface between the PH domain and middle domain ( MD ) in contrast to DRPs ( ﬁg . 7 B ) . Using ML analysis , a putative transitional DRP - to - DNM protein , DNL1A ( ﬁg . 7 C ) , with distinctive MD was identiﬁed among three DRPs of F . alba ( supplementary ﬁg . S4 A ) . The other domains , GTPase and GTPase effector domain , of identiﬁed nucleariid protein were typical of DRP ( supplementary ﬁg . S4 B and C ) , suggest - ing that transformation of DRP to DNM was initiated in the MD . Next , we analyzed the C - terminal tails of DNM and DRP as the major platform of DNM recruitment to CCPs ( Sundborger and Hinshaw 2014 ) . Various DRPs of eukaryotes possessed a C - terminal tail ; however , it was not conserved and lacked multiple PxxP motifs present in classical DNM ( ﬁg . 7D and supplementary table S10 , Supplementary Material online ) . Within the transitional DRP - to - DNM protein of F . alba , a long C - terminus with PxxP motifs necessary for SH3 domain interactions was documented . The distribution across eukary - otes of SH3 - containing proteins , SNX9 and AMPH , that are important recruiters of DNM ( Sundborger and Hinshaw 2014 ) , coincided with the presence of PxxP motifs in the DNM / DRP tails ( ﬁg . 7D and supplementary table S10 , Supplementary Material online ) . These proteins were ﬁrst found in the apu - somonad T . trahens that belongs to a group that branched prior to Opisthokonta ( supplementary tables S1 and S4 , Supplementary Material online ) . Within opisthokonts , SNX9 and AMPH as well as DRP with a proline - enriched C - terminus were poorly conserved or lost in fungi . However , these SH3 domain proteins together with their target motifs in DNM became conserved in holozoans . Noteworthy , another SH3 - containing regulator of this GTPase , the ITSN protein , under - went expansion of its SH3 domains from two to ﬁve in this taxon ( ﬁg . 7 D ) . In the cytosol , DNM persists in a repressed state in complex with SNX9 and the glycolytic enzyme aldolase , AldoA ( ﬁg . 7 E ) . Aldolase prevents binding of SNX9 to the PM via interaction with the Phox homologous domain ( Lundmark and Carlsson 2004 ) . As SNX9 was poorly presented in the reference fungal proteomes used in this study , exhaustive search for SNX9 ho - mologs through the UniProt and NCBI databases was per - formed . A conserved motif with negatively charged and hydrophobic residues required for binding to aldolase ( Rangarajan et al . 2010 ) was found in SNX9 of holozoans but not in fungi or T . trahens ( ﬁg . 7F and supplementary ﬁg . S5 , Supplementary Material online ) . A high level of aldolase conservation as well as its residues involved in SNX9 binding ( Rangarajan et al . 2010 ) was observed throughout eukaryotes ( supplementary table S11 , Supplementary Material online ) . Thus , multiple concurrent changes contributed to the emergence of novel mechanism of vesicle ﬁssion based on the mechanochemical GTPase DNM and included regulators of membrane curvature and actin polymerization . The emer - gence of DNM from DRP occurred in several steps : The ﬁrst transformation apparently was initiated in the MD , then the C - terminus gained multiple linear motifs for SH3 domain bind - ing , and the PH domain and corresponding interaction inter - face emerged . The distribution and conservation of SH3 - containing interactors of DNM overlap with the presence of PxxP motifs within the C - terminal tail of the GTPase . Thus , apparently , the mechanism of negative regulation and bring - ing DNM to endocytic sites via the SH3 - containing recruiters was accomplished in holozoans . Discussion The complexity of modern organisms is a result of long - term evolution . All the features of living creatures are based on sophisticated interplay of events at the molecular level . Yet , how was the molecular basis of known processes gained , which steps did it take , and what was its relative timing ? Trying to answer these questions in the ﬁeld of endocytosis , we followed transformation of the CME machinery during the course of eukaryotic evolution . The most ancient core endo - cytic proteins typical of most eukaryotes were deﬁned as well as gains of novel components together with their links to ex - isting components . The results showed that CME underwent many - sided changes affecting early and late stages of CCV formation , and the way of loading the endocytic cargoes . The analysis revealed that LECA possessed a subset of 22 of 35 proteins crucial for animal CME that apparently were suf - ﬁcient to form CCVs . The core CME proteins clathrin and AP2 , as well as proteins involved in membrane deformation , cla - thrin assembly , recruitment of the actin cytoskeleton , and ves - icle uncoating were found in major eukaryotic branches . These data are in line with previous studies that reported the ubiquitous nature of CME in eukaryotes ( Field et al . 2007 ) . One of the early gains of multiple endocytic proteins oc - curred in opisthokonts . Three functionally linked proteins ( FCHO , Eps15 , and ITSN ) were derived from conserved ances - tral molecules . The proteins mentioned constitute the FEI func - tional complex , needed for early and intermediate steps of CME in animals . Ancestors of the FEI components , the EEC and muHD - containing proteins , were found in eukaryotic branches beyond opisthokonts , in particular in excavate N . gruberi that belongs to the earliest branch of extant eukary - otes ( Cavalier - Smith et al . 2014 ) .

All EEC pro - teins studied to date , in particular the plant AtEH1 / 2 ( Gadeyne et al . 2014 ) , the fungal Ede1 , End3p , and Pan1p ( Weinberg and Drubin 2012 ) , as well as the animal Eps15 , ITSN , and Reps ( Cullis et al . 2002 ) are involved in CME . The high level of conservation of EEC proteins across eukaryotes and their low number in proteomes indicated a speciﬁc role of EEC proteins in the mechanism of CME in eukaryotes . We suggest that Eps15 and ITSN are opisthokont - speciﬁc variants of con - served EEC proteins . Ubiquitin - binding domains were added to the EEC C - terminus to form the Eps15 protein , while mul - tiple SH3 domains and the DH - PH - C2 terminus were com - bined with EEC within ITSN . Conserved in eukaryotes the muHD - containing protein gained an FCH domain resulting in the FCHO protein . Modules responsible for interaction of EEC - containing proteins with FCHO homologs within the FEI proteins have been found in these proteins since their emer - gence . In opisthokonts , FCHO , Eps15 , and ITSN underwent extensive lineage - speciﬁc transformations ( ﬁg . 8 ) . Despite var - iability of structures the FEI proteins play important role in early stages of CME both in fungi and animals ( Henne et al . 2010 ; Mayers et al . 2013 ; Boeke et al . 2014 . Addition of novel components to the CME machinery led to modiﬁcations of the endocytic PIN . We propose that FEI functional network became the third endocytic hub along with AP2 and clathrin that integrate the vesicle - forming ma - chinery and CLASPs recruiting speciﬁc cargoes to the nascent pits . The existence of functionally distinct groups relies on the universal role of accessory proteins in vesicle formation and on the speciﬁc function of CLASPs in the selection of a certain cargo . Both AP2 complex and FEI proteins are required for initial steps of CME ( Henne et al . 2010 ; Kirchhausen et al . 2014 ) . The FEI functional complex could function in coopera - tion with AP2 or more intriguingly could mediate alternative scenarios of AP2 - independent internalization . The available data support this hypothesis . CME occurs without AP2 in intact cells as well as upon depletion of the adaptor complex ( Motley et al . 2003 ; Mettlen et al . 2009 ) . Moreover , efﬁcient internalization of integrin b 1 cargo via the complex of DAB2 and Eps15 / ITSN proteins occurred independently of AP2 ( Teckchandani et al . 2012 ) . Although the stable complex of F IG . 8 . — Domain architecture and interactions of FEI components and related proteins of various taxa . Known protein interactions are shown as dashed lines . Homologs of ITSN are lost in ascomycetes ; in vertebrates , FEI components are represented by two paralogous proteins each ; SGIP represents a vertebrate - speciﬁc member of the muniscin protein family with expression restricted to the brain . Dergai et al . GBE 602 Genome Biol . Evol . 8 ( 3 ) : 588 – 606 . doi : 10 . 1093 / gbe / evw028 Advance Access publication February 12 , 2016 the AP2 subunits was substantially documented ( Kelly et al . 2014 ) , the possibility of existence of the preassembled FEI complex was not established . The structure of the FEI func - tional network and stoichiometry of its components at the endocytic site remains unresolved ; however , organization of this network could be quite complex regarding that both Eps15 and ITSN are able to form oligomers ( Tebar et al . 1997 ; Wong et al . 2012 ) . Involvement of animal AP2 in CME is controlled by the FEI proteins . The latter recruits AP2 to the PM ( Henne et al . 2010 ) and shifts the adaptor complex to an open ( active ) conforma - tion ( Hollopeter et al . 2014 ; Umasankar et al . 2014 ) . The APA region within FCHO critical for the activation of AP2 emerged in holozoans . Concurrent structural changes in AP2 were doc - umented that contributed to its closed state requiring an ac - tivator . The alpha and mu subunits of AP2 gained conserved residues responsible for contacts within and between subunits necessary for the closed conformation . In other eukaryotes corresponding residues were not conserved or distinct , indi - cating the lack of intra - and intersubunit contacts or the use of a different mechanism . Thus , the conformation of AP2 and therefore its functional activity became dependent on the FEI functional complex in holozoans . CME gradually underwent integration with systems evolv - ing on the way to animals , in particular signal transduction and cellular communication ( Ben - Shlomo et al . 2003 ; Zaidel - Bar 2009 ) . To provide noncompetitive internalization of nu - merous membrane proteins , speciﬁc sorting proteins were gained . CLASPs that recognize proteins required for the trafﬁc of vesicles ( SNAREs ) and ancient signaling molecules ( GPCRs ) have been present since LECA . These are CALM and ARRB . Furthermore , during the period from the ﬁrst opisthokonts to animals , new sorting proteins were derived from endocytic and signaling proteins via acquisition of cargo - binding regions and short motifs for recruitment to the sites of CME . The general evolutionary trend observed for the majority of CLASPs was acquisition of novel linear motifs and / or increase in their number . This could affect speciﬁcity and afﬁnity of interactions within endocytic PIN as well as provide avidity - based complex assembly ( Olesen et al . 2008 ) . It is noteworthy that known cargoes for PTB - containing CLASPs typical for metazoans are restricted to molecules involved in signaling pathways and cell contacts ( Traub 2009 ) . It is expected that the current list of known CLASPs as well as their ligands is far from complete and progress in the investigation of animal CME in vivo will reveal new components of cargo selection and recruitment ( Schmid et al . 2014 ) . We assume that the mechanism of deep invagination of the endocytic membrane and subsequent vesicle scission also underwent transformation on the way to animals . The critical set of components involving DNM and its positive and nega - tive regulators were observed since holozoans . DNM was de - rived from DRP via several major innovations . The PH domain that controls oligomerization and membrane association was gained in holozoans . Another feature speciﬁc for DNM is the C - terminal tail enriched in PxxP motifs . We suggest that emer - gence of linear motifs in SNX9 ( LC ) and DNM ( PxxP ) accom - plished the formation of the regulatory complex . Other components , SNX9 and AMPH , were gained earlier but became conserved in holozoans concomintantly with acquisi - tion of linear motifs in DNM . This assumption is in line with the notion that linear motifs are important switchers of evolution of molecular complexes and interaction networks ( Neduva and Russell 2005 ) . Polymerization of actin was shown to precede vesicle ﬁs - sion in animal cells ( Merriﬁeld et al . 2005 ) . Two essential reg - ulators of actin dynamics were identiﬁed at the sites of vesicle formation . Conserved in eukaryotes , the ARP2 / 3 ( actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex ) complex that is responsible for the for - mation of the branched actin network could be recruited to CCPs via interaction with the LC region of SNX9 in holozoans . In addition , holozoans acquired the actin regulator CTTN that accumulates in CCPs before ﬁssion at the same time as DNM ( Sebe´ - Pedro´s et al . 2011 ) , apparently due to interaction with the enzyme via the SH3 domain . Emergence of the regulatory complex engaging DNM in holozoans is a good example of how emergence of linear motif - based interactions contributed to cooperation between systems responsible for membrane deformation - ﬁssion ( SNX9 - DNM , AMPH - DNM ) and actin cy - toskeleton polymerization ( SNX9 - CTTN , DNM - CTTN ) . Recently , DNM was suggested to be a central component of the CME checkpoint in mammals capable of deﬁning abor - tive and productive CCPs . The prolin - enriched C - terminus of DNM mediated numerous decisive interactions with SH3 domain - containing proteins capable of sensing membrane curvature , the presence of coat protein and cargo ( Loerke et al . 2009 ) . Formation of the molecular basis for the CME restriction point was accomplished in holozoans upon emer - gence of numerous PxxP motifs within DNM disordered C - terminus . One of the last prominent changes of the CME machinery described was the generation of multiple paralogs in meta - zoans . Thus , 60 % of the endocytic components studied were presented as protein families in vertebrates . Paralogs are often characterized by distinct expression proﬁles in tissues ( DNM1 / DNM2 / DNM3 , SYNJ1 / SYNJ2 , WAS / WASL , CLTA / CLTB , AMPH1 / BIN1 , FCHO1 / FCHO2 , CALM / AP180 , etc . ) or could differ in cellular localization ( NECAP1 / NECAP2 , SNX9 / SNX18 / SNX33 ) . However , in most cases the precise functional role of paralogous proteins remains so far unresolved . Paralogs specialized in different tissues or cellular compart - ments could reﬂect the need for ﬁne - tuned speciﬁc regulation developed by endomembrane system during its evolution . The major documented alterations in CME are summarized in ﬁgure 9 . Current analysis evidenced that animals together with sister group choanozoans have distinct elaborate mech - anisms to control CME . More strictly regulated CME capable of internalizing multiple cargoes including molecules of Evolution of Endocytosis GBE Genome Biol . Evol . 8 ( 3 ) : 588 – 606 . doi : 10 . 1093 / gbe / evw028 Advance Access publication February 12 , 2016 603 adhesion and cell - to - cell contacts together with elaborate sig - naling could have impact on the emergence of multicellularity in animals ( Sigismund et al . 2012 ) . Notably , many systems of animal cells were formed in holozoans similarly to features that control ﬁdelity of CME . For instance , regulation of bio - synthesis ( Brown et al . 2008 ) , gene expression ( Sebe´ - Pedro´s et al . 2011 ) , and signalling ( Suga et al . 2014 ) typical of animals was gained in the common ancestor of holozoans . The data show essential differences between molecular machineries in - volved in CME in animals and widely exploited model of in - tracellular trafﬁc , yeasts . Evolutionary analysis of endocytosis could be useful for interpretation of results and explain exper - imental discrepancies of investigations of CME using different model organisms . Moreover , it can predict speciﬁc features of endocytic internalization in certain taxa . Our better understanding of the evolution of CME is cur - rently limited by the lack of data for the period between the ﬁrst and the LECAs that remains largely a black box for investigations . Another constraint is poor structure - to - func - tion and sequence data for under - represented groups , that is , choanozoans , apusomonads , and others . The lack in certain species or taxonomic groups of CME components that are homologous to those speciﬁc of animals could suggest alter - native scenarios of endocytosis . The function of a missing ho - molog could either be performed by a highly related protein as reported for the beta subunit of AP2 ( Thomas Sosa et al . 2012 ) or a CME mechanism could be modiﬁed to an extent that does not require function of the homolog mentioned . These possibilities could suggest further directions to study endocytic mechanisms in eukaryotes .

During eu - karyotic evolution addition to the CME machinery of components with novelfeatureswas observedas wellasstructure – functionaladjustments of emerged and pre - existing components . A novel organizing center for endocytic components was gained in opisthokonts and could contribute to the efﬁciency of endocytic internalization . The FEI functional network became deeply integrated in the endocytic interaction network and was proposed as third interaction hub together with AP2 and clathrin . Additional mechanisms of ﬁdelity control emerged in CME of holozoans apparently due to interconnection of endocytosis with evolving signaling pathways . In holozoans , activation of the AP2 complex during the early stage of CME became dependent on FEI , in particular interaction with the FCHO protein . Here the CME checkpoint emerged based on multiple in - teractions of the ﬁssion enzyme DNM with the SH3 domain accessory proteins . The emergence of DNM in holozoans as well as the mechanism of its recruitment and negative regulation resulted in changes in late CME stages . Expansion of PM receptor families and adhesion molecules essen - tial for cellular integration and communication was accompanied by ac - quisition of various sorting proteins . CLASPs capable of recognizing speciﬁc sorting motifs could provide noncompetitive internalization of dif - ferent cargoes . Within metazoans CME could undergo adaptation for cell type – speciﬁc functions , in particular via massive paralogous expansion of endocytic genes in vertebrates . Many redundant interactions of paralo - gous proteins could also contribute to the fault tolerance and robustness of the system . Dergai et al . GBE 604 Genome Biol .
