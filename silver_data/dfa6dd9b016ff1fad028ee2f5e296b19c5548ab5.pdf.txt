Curr Biol 22 , 1 - 10 ( 2012 ) abstRAct Integrins are heterodimeric αβ transmembrane receptors that play key roles in cel - lular physiology and pathology . Accumulating data indicate that two NPxY motifs in the β - subunit synergistically promote integrin activation through the binding of talin and kindlin . However , it is unclear how the individual motifs regulate integrin function and trafficking . To investigate how the NPxY motifs individually control integrin α5β 1 function and trafficking , we introduced Y > A mutations in either motif . Disruption of the membrane - proximal NPxY completely prevented α 5 β 1 - induced morphological changes , cell scattering and migration , and fibronectin fibrillogenesis . In addition , it reduced α5β1 internalization but not its recycling . In contrast , disruption of the mem - brane - distal NPxY promoted degradation of α5β 1 in late endosomes / lysosomes , but did not prevent α5β 1 - dependent cell scattering , migration , or fibronectin fibrillogenesis . Whereas depletion of either talin - 1 or kindlin - 2 reduced α 5 β 1 binding to fibronectin and cell adhesion , talin - 1 depletion recapitulated the loss - of - function phenotype of the membrane - proximal NPxY mutation , while kindlin - 2 depletion induced α5β 1 accumu - lation in lysosomes and degradation . Thus , the two NPxY motifs of β 1 play distinct and separable roles in controlling the function and trafficking of α 5 β 1 . Whereas talin - binding to the membrane - proximal NPxY is crucial for connecting α 5 β 1 to the actin cytoskel - eton and thus to permit the tension required for fibronectin fibrillogenesis and cell migra - tion , kindlin - binding to the membrane - distal NPxY is dispensable for these events but regulates α5β1 surface expression and degradation . IntRoDUctIon Integrins constitute a family of 24 het - erodimeric αβ transmembrane recep - tors that connect the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) to the cytoskeleton and thus regu - late cell adhesion , spreading and migra - tion , and ECM organization . Integrins exist in low - and high - affinity conforma - tions for ligand , and the allosteric change favouring high - affinity can be induced either by cytoplasmic events ( ‘inside - out’ activation ) or by extracellular factors ( ‘outside - in’ activation ) ( 1 ) . Ligand - bind - ing triggers integrin clustering ( avidity ) , connection to the cytoskeleton , and the assembly of adhesion complexes includ - ing focal adhesions ( FAs ) and fibrillar adhesions ( FBs ) ( 2 ) . Integrins in circulating cells such as the platelet - integrin α IIb β 3 are kept in the low - affinity conformation pre - dominantly by a salt bridge between the α - and β - subunit , which is disrupted upon talin - binding to a conserved mem - brane - proximal ( MP ) - NPxY motif in the β - cytoplasmic tail ( 1 ) . Furthermore , α IIb β 3 activation requires kindlin - 3 - binding to a membrane - distal ( MD ) - NxxY motif ( 3 ) . Whereas tyrosine - phos - phorylation of these motifs is important for α IIb β 3 function in vivo , mutations that impair phosphorylation of both motifs in the β 1 - tail do not cause abnormalities in mice , and neither does a D > A mutation that prevents the formation of the salt - NPxY - regulated integrin activation and trafficking 7 185 bridge ( 4 - 6 ) . Indeed , it is increasingly recognized that activation - mechanisms differ across cell types and between indi - vidual integrins , and inside - out activation may be less important for β 1 - integrins in adherent cells ( 7 , 8 ) . Integrin function in adherent cells depends strongly on talin - mediated increase in avidity and connec - tion to the actin cytoskeleton , as well as on the dynamic regulation of integrin internalization and recycling ( 9 - 12 ) . NPxY motifs are canonical signals for clathrin - mediated endocytosis , but it is controversial to what extent the NPxY motifs in integrin β - subunits control inte - grin internalization , as integrins can inter - nalize via both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent mechanisms ( 13 ) . Clathrin adaptors including Dab - 2 and Numb bind to the NPxY motifs , and deple - tion of Dab - 2 , Numb , or clathrin leads to decreased integrin endocytosis ( 14 - 17 ) . Accordingly , endocytosis of β 1 - integrins is reduced by Y > F substitutions in both NPxY motifs ( 18 ) . However , the same mutations cause no phenotype in mice . In fact , more disruptive Y > A mutations in both NPxY motifs dramatically decrease , in addition to integrin activation , also inte - grin surface expression ( 5 , 6 ) . The latter observation is intriguing and suggests that the NPxY motifs may actually promote integrin recycling , rather than internaliza - tion . It is likely that the regulation of inte - grin activation and trafficking by the NPxY motifs is interconnected , as accumulating evidence indicates that active and inactive integrins are internalized and recycled via separate pathways and through different compartments ( 19 - 23 ) . Here , we investigate how the individ - ual NPxY motifs in the β 1 - tail coordinate activation , internalization , and subse - quent intracellular sorting and recycling of the fibronectin ( FN ) - binding integrin α5β1 . We find that whereas both con - tribute to internalization , disruption of the MP - NPxY leads to a complete loss - of - function , but does not impair recycling . By contrast , disruption of the MD - NPxY leads to lysosomal degradation . Never - theless , it does not abolish α5β 1 func - tion . The loss - of - function phenotype of the MP - NPxY mutant is recapitulated by depletion of talin - 1 , whereas depletion of kindlin - 2 recapitulates the reduction in α5β 1 surface levels , accumulation in lyso - somes , and increased degradation . ResUlts The MP - nPxY but not the MD - nPxY motif in β 1 is required for α 5 β 1 - in - duced disruption of cell - cell junctions and cell scattering . Expression of the integrin β 1 - subunit into β 1 - null epithelial GE11 cells , creat - ing GE β 1 cells , results primarily in surface expression of α 5 β 1 and causes the loss of cell - cell contacts , cell scattering and fast cell migration . In addition , α 5 β 1 induces the assembly of FBs , FN fibrillogenesis , and a morphological change toward a con - tractile , fibroblast - like phenotype with multiple protrusions and a few large FAs ( Figure S1 ) ( 25 - 27 ) . We introduced Y > A mutations in β 1A , either in the MP - NPxY motif ( β 1 Y783A ) , the MD - NPxY motif ( β 1 Y795A ) , or both ( β 1 Y783 / 795A ) , and then stably expressed these mutants in GE11 ( Figure 1A ) . Strikingly , cells expressing 186 α 5 β 1 Y783A or α 5 β 1 Y783 / 795A completely failed to induce cell scattering and mor - phological changes , and thus resembled the knockout cells ( Figures 1B - D ) . In contrast , α 5 β 1 Y795A caused cell scattering , disrup - tion of cell - cell contacts , and a flattened , mesenchymal morphology , albeit with less - pronounced protrusions than in GE β 1 cells ( Figures 1B - D ) . In fact , cell spreading of GE β 1 Y795A cells was on average increased two - fold compared to GE β 1 ( 2005 versus 870 m m 2 ) . FAs were visualized using an antibody against phosphotyrosine ( PY ) , which co - localizes with several FA proteins ( Figure S2A ) . The number of FAs was up to 5 times higher ( 315 versus 64 FAs / cell ) , although individual adhesions were on average slightly smaller ( 0 . 53 versus 0 . 64 m m 2 ) ( Figures 1E - G ) . The total ‘adhesive area’ of GE β 1 Y795A was almost two - fold larger than that of GE β 1 ( 8 % versus 5 % ; Figure 1H ) . We then generated mCherry - vinculin - expressing GE β 1 and GE β 1 Y795A cells , and analysed FAs by live - cell imaging using total internal reflection microscopy ( TIRF ) . The number of FAs was clearly increased in GE β 1 Y795A cells , as compared to that in GE β 1 ( Figure S2B ) . Together , these Figure 1 Disruption of the MP - but not the MD - NPxY in β 1 prevents α 5 β 1 - induced dissociation of cell - cell contacts and cell scattering .

The adhesive area was calculated as the ratio total FA area / cell area ( H ) . Statistically significant differences are indicated by * * ( p < 0 . 01 ) or * * * * ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . NPxY - regulated integrin activation and trafficking 7 187 data show that disruption of the MP - NPxY prevents α 5 β 1 - induced cell scattering and morphological changes , whereas disrup - tion of the MD - NPxY does not . The MP - nPxY but not the MD - nPxY motif in β 1 is required for α 5 β 1 - induced fn fibrillogenesis , fibrillar adhesion formation , and cell migration . We next investigated FN fibrillogenesis in confluent cell cultures by confocal micros - copy . Both β 1 Y783A and β 1 Y783 / 795A failed to support FN fibrillogenesis , whereas cells expressing β 1 Y795A formed FN fibrils , simi - larly to GE β 1 cells ( Figure 2A ) . Transient transfection of GFP - tensin - 1 and staining of FAs revealed that GE β 1 and GE β 1 Y795A cells contained centrally - located tensin - 1 - positive FBs ( Figure 2B , dashed arrows ) that were clearly separated from PY - posi - tive FAs at the cell periphery , which was not observed in GE11 , GE β 1 Y783A , and GE β 1 Y783 / 795A cells ( solid arrows ) . In addi - tion , GE β 1 and GE β 1 Y795A cells were fast - migrating cells , whereas GE11 , GE β 1 Y783A and β 1 Y783 / 795A were significantly less motile ( Figures 2C - E ) . We then introduced the same β 1 - mutants in a different β 1 - deficient cell line , GD25 . Like in GE11 , both wild - type β 1 and β 1 Y795A induced a loss of cadherin - based cell - cell junctions , cell scattering , and a redistribution of FAs to the tips of protrusions . In contrast , GD β 1 Y783A and GD β 1 Y783 / 795A cells grow in islands like GD25 , with cadherin - based cell - Figure 2 Disruption of the MP - but not the MD - NPxY in β 1 prevents α 5 β 1 - induced FN fibrillogenesis , assembly of FBs , and cell migration .

Furthermore , both GD β 1 and GD β 1 Y795A cells , but not GD β 1 Y783A and GD β 1 Y783 / 795A , supported FN fibrillogen - esis ( Figure S3D ) and displayed large , central FBs ( Figure S3E , dashed arrows ) , and small peripheral FAs ( Figure S3E , solid arrows ) . Last , both GD β 1 and GD β 1 Y795A cells migrated significantly faster over FN than did GD25 , GD β 1 Y783A , and GD β 1 Y783 / 795A cells ( Figures S4A , B ) . Taken together , these data strongly suggest that the MP - NPxY motif in β 1 is absolutely required for α 5 β 1 function , whereas the MD - NPxY motif is not . The MP - nPxY motif in β 1 is required for growth factor - induced cell scatter - ing and loss of cell - cell contacts . The previous sections have shown that the MP - NPxY motif in β 1 is essential for α 5 β 1 - induced changes reminiscent of those that occur during epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , such as disruption of cell - cell contacts and the stimulation of cell scattering , migration , and FN fibrillogenesis . We next investi - gated whether well - established physiolog - ical inducers of cell scattering and other EMT - related events , such as hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) or transforming growth factor - β ( TGF - β ) , can overcome the requirement for the MP - NPxY motif . Stimulation with either HGF or TGF - β triggered morphological changes in all cell lines ( Figure 3 ) . However , although the islands formed by GE β 1 Y783A and ( to a lesser extent ) GE β 1 Y783 / 795A cells seemed less coherent , a dramatic loss of cell - cell adhesion and concomitant cell scattering was not observed , even after prolonged incubation ( up to 72 hrs ) with either factor ( Figure 3 ) . This was not due to an intrinsic defect in the signaling machin - ery to respond to these growth factors , as HGF - and TGF - β - induced changes in gene expression were detected in all cell lines ( data not shown ) . Thus , these data show that disruption of the MP - NPxY motif in β 1 prevents cell scattering , even in the presence of known inducers of cell scattering and EMT . The MP - nPxY motif in β 1 is required for α 5 β 1 activation , whereas the MD - nPxY motif prevents accumula - tion in late endosomes / lysosomes and subsequent degradation . We next analyzed the cell - surface expres - sion and activation status of the mutant integrins . Interestingly , although all cell lines had been sorted for equal expres - sion levels shortly after retroviral deliv - ery , FACS - analysis consistently revealed that surface expression of the α 5 β 1 Y795A and α 5 β 1 Y783 / 795A mutants was dramati - cally reduced ( to 50 % of that of wild - type α 5 β 1 ) , both in GE11 and in GD25 cells , whereas expression of α 5 β 1 Y783A was not reduced ( Figures 4A , S4C ) . Consis - tent with the biological phenotype , the activation - index ( ratio active β 1 / total β 1 ) of both α 5 β 1 Y783A and α 5 β 1 Y783 / 795A at the cell - surface was low ( ~ 30 % of that of wild - type β 1 ; Figure 4A ) . In contrast , the activation - index of α 5 β 1 Y795A was slightly decreased in GE11 ( ~ 70 % of that of wild - type β 1 ; Figure 4A ) and unaltered in GD25 cells ( Figure S4C ) . Consistent with these results , FN - binding to cell - surface α 5 β 1 was significantly reduced in GE β 1 Y783A and GE β 1 Y783 / 795A cells , but not in GE β 1 Y795A . The differences in affinity NPxY - regulated integrin activation and trafficking 7 189 could not be attributed to altered expres - sion of talins or kindlins ( Figure S4D ) . We next assessed whether the NPxY motifs regulate the subcellular distribu - tion of α 5 β 1 , using live - cell confocal microscopy on cells transiently trans - fected with eGFP - α 5 . Wild - type α 5 β1 was distributed all over the membrane . In addition , a large pool was found in vesicles , and co - transfection of mCherry - tagged lysosomal - associated membrane protein ( LAMP ) - 1 revealed that a propor - tion of these were late endosomes ( LE ) / lysosomes ( Figure 4B ) . Localization of α 5 β 1 Y783A was also observed at the mem - brane , but was virtually absent from vesi - cles ( Figure 4B ) . In contrast , α 5 β 1 Y795A and α 5 β 1 Y783 / 795A were hardly visible at the membrane , but accumulated dramatically in LE / lysosomes ( Figure 4B ) . Western blotting for the β 1 - subunit supported the results obtained by FACS ; the mature pool of β 1 ( 130 kD ) was clearly reduced in GE β 1 Y795A and GE β 1 Y783 / 795A , but not in GE β 1 Y783A cells ( Figure 4B ) . The precursor β 1 ( 110 kD ) was reduced in all mutants . Treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 strongly increased cell - surface β 1 expression in all cell lines , but most prominently in GE β 1 Y795A and GE β 1 Y783 / 795A cells . In contrast , expression of the transferrin receptor ( TfnR ) , which is not routed to lysosomes , was unaffected ( Figure 4C ) . We then investigated the stability of α 5 β 1 over time by surface - labeling with biotin , followed by capture - ELISA . With increasing incubation time , both α 5 β 1 Y795A and α 5 β 1 Y783 / 795A were Figure 3 Disruption of the MP - NPxY in β 1 prevents dissociation of cell - cell contacts and cell scattering induced by HGF or TGF - β .

Together , these results indicate that the MP - NPxY motif in β 1 primarily regu - lates integrin α 5 β 1 activation , while the MD - NPxY motif regulates cell - surface expression , by preventing lysosomal degradation . Integrin activation triggers α 5 β 1 accumulation in late endosomes / lysosomes , but not cell scattering , upon disruption of the MP - nPxY Because it is primarily the active , FN - bound fraction of α 5 β 1 that traffics to the LE / lysosomal system ( 22 , 23 ) , we reasoned that α 5 β 1 Y795A and α 5 β 1 Y783 / 795A in LE / lysosomes are in the active con - formation . Colocalisation of β 1 with 9EG7 staining supported this hypoth - esis ( Figure 5A ) . To confirm that integrin activation triggers lysosomal routing , we Figure 4 The MP - NPxY motif is required for α 5 β 1 activation , whereas the MD - NPxY motif regulates α 5 β 1 surface expression , accumulation in LE / lysosomes , and degradation .

NPxY - regulated integrin activation and trafficking 7 191 used a constitutively - active α 5 - mutant ( CA - α 5 ) containing an F1025A mutation in the GFFKR sequence ( Figure 5B ) ( 27 ) . Subcellular distribution of CA - α 5 β 1 was visualized in cells co - expressing eGFP - CA - α 5 and mCherry - LAMP - 1 . In GE β 1 cells , CA - α 5 β 1 was detected at the mem - brane and in LE / lysosomes ( Figure 5B ) . Expression of CA - α 5 in GE β 1 Y783A cells directed a significant fraction of α 5 β 1 to LE / lysosomes , but had no obvious effect on the subcellular distribution of α 5 β 1 Y795A and α 5 β 1 Y783 / 795A ( Figure 5B ) . We next incubated cells either with the β 1 - activating antibody TS2 / 16 ( 10 m g / ml ) , or with K - 20 ( 10 m g / ml ) , which rec - ognizes both active and inactive β 1 - integ - rins and does not induce integrin activa - tion . Whereas TS2 / 16 accumulated dra - matically in LE / lysosomes in all cell lines , K - 20 was predominantly detected in LE / lysosomes in GE β 1 Y795A and GE β 1 Y793 / 795A cells , but not in GE β 1 and GE β 1 Y783A , as in steady - state conditions ( Figure 5C ) . Importantly , neither expression of CA - α 5 nor incubation with TS2 / 16 induced cell scattering or the concomitant morphologi - cal changes in GE β 1 Y783 and GE β 1 Y783 / 795A cells ( Figure 5C and data not shown ) . We then tested the effects of TS2 / 16 on α 5 β 1 - mediated cell adhesion to FN , in the presence of GRGDSP - peptide ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) to block FN - binding by endogenous α v β 3 ( 28 ) . Basal α 5 β 1 - mediated cell adhesion to FN was comparable in GE β 1 and GE β 1 Y795A cells , but was consider - ably reduced in GE β 1 Y783A and completely prevented in GE β 1 Y793 / 795A cells . Inter - estingly , TS2 / 16 significantly increased cell adhesion in all cell lines except in GE β 1 Y795A ( Figure 5D ) . In summary , these results show that lysosomal α 5 β 1 Y795A and α 5 β 1 Y783 / 795A are in active conforma - tion , that activated integrins from the cell - surface accumulate in LE / lysosomes , and that outside - in activation can modestly promote cell adhesion , but not cell scat - tering and concomitant morphological changes , in the MP - NPxY mutants . The nPxY motifs regulate α 5 β 1 inter - nalization and recycling We next addressed how α 5 β 1 internal - ization and recycling are regulated by the NPxY motifs by biotin - labeling of cell - surface integrins followed by capture - ELISA , according to established methods ( 10 ) . Interestingly , internalization of all β 1 - mutants in the presence of the recy - cling inhibitor primaquine was reduced about two - fold compared to that of wild - type α 5 β 1 , whereas internalization of TfnR in the same cells was not ( Figures 6A , S5A ) . A large fraction of internalized α 5 β 1 ( up to 60 % ) was rapidly degraded in GE β 1 Y795A and GE β 1 Y793 / 795A cells , but not in GE β 1 Y783A ( Figure 6B ) , while degra - dation of internalized TfnR was negligible in all cell lines ( data not shown ) . Impor - tantly , despite the dramatic degradation of internalized α 5 β 1 Y795A and α 5 β 1 Y793 / 795 , there was still measurable recycling of the two mutants , albeit less than of wild - type α 5 β 1 . Very rapid recycling was observed for α 5 β 1 Y783A ( Figure 6C ) . In contrast , recycling of TfnR was similar in all mutant cell lines , though unexpectedly higher than in GE β 1 cells ( Figure S5B ) . Together , these results demonstrate that both NPxY motifs contribute to α 5 β 1 internalization , and that the MD - NPxY but not the MP - NPxY is critical to allow internalized α 5 β 1 to escape lysosomal routing and degradation . Importantly , the 192 igure 5 Disruption of the MP - NPxY does not abolish activation - triggered α 5 β 1 routing to LE / lysosomes , but prevents cell scattering .

MD - NPxY mutant that escapes lysosomal degradation can still be recycled . Depletion of β 1 or talin - 1 prevents α 5 β 1 - mediated cell scattering and mor - phological changes , whereas depletion of kindlin - 2 induces α 5 β 1 degradation We next investigated whether the pheno - types of the Y > A mutants can be recapitu - lated by the depletion of talin or kindlin . To this end , we introduced shRNAs against talin - 1 , kindlin - 2 or β 1 into GE β 1 cells . Knockdown of protein expression was verified by Western blotting and was highly efficient ( more than 90 % ; Figure 7A ) . Depletion of β 1 clearly reversed the α 5 β 1 - mediated changes ; cell scattering was prevented and cells grew in GE11 - like islands with cadherin - based cell - cell contacts and many small and randomly distributed FAs , rather than a few large FAs at the cell periphery ( Figures 7B , C ) . NPxY - regulated integrin activation and trafficking 7 193 Talin - 1 depletion also reduced cell scat - tering and caused at least a partial rever - sal toward the formation of islands with cadherin - based cell - cell contacts . On the contrary , kindlin - 2 depletion seemed to have no apparent effect on cell scattering or morphology ( Figures 7B , C ) . We then assessed β 1 expression at the cell - surface as well as α 5 β 1 binding to FN by FACS . While talin - 1 depletion seemed to have no apparent effect on β 1 cell - surface expres - sion , binding of soluble FN was strongly decreased . By contrast , kindlin - 2 knock - down decreased β 1 cell - surface expres - sion while modestly reducing FN binding ( Figures 7D , E ) . Consistent with this result , cell adhesion to FN was strongly decreased by depletion of talin - 1 and to a lesser extent by kindlin - 2 depletion ( Figure 7F ) . Live - cell microscopy on GFP - α 5 and mCherry - LAMP - 1 co - expressing cells revealed a reduction of α 5 β 1 at the plasma membrane in kindlin - 2 - depleted cells , confirming the results obtained by FACS , and increased α 5 β 1 accumulation was observed in LE / lysosomes ( Figure 7G ) . Moreover , degradation assays revealed that the degradation rate of cell - surface α 5 β 1 is increased in kindlin - 2 - depleted cells ( Figure 7H ) . In conclusion , these results suggest that whereas both talin - 1 and kindlin - 2 increase α 5 β 1 activation and cell adhesion to FN , depletion of talin - 1 in GE β 1 cells causes a reversal of the α 5 β 1 - dependent phenotype but depletion of kindlin - 2 does not . Instead , knockdown of kindlin - 2 expression leads to reduced cell - surface levels of α 5 β 1 , increased accu - mulation in LE / lysosomes , and enhanced α 5 β 1 degradation .

In con - trast , Y > A mutation in the kindlin - bind - ing MD - NPxY ( β 1 Y795A ) leads to dramatic lysosomal degradation , but surprisingly does not abolish α5β 1 activation or func - tion . These data imply that the two NPxY motifs play quite distinct and separable roles with regard to controlling α 5 β 1 acti - vation and trafficking . The loss - of - function phenotype of the α 5 β 1 Y783A mutant is not rescued by forced integrin activation , because neither FFigure 7 Depletion of β 1 or talin - 1 in GE β 1 cells induces MET , whereas depletion of kindlin - 2 triggers α 5 β 1 accumulation in LE / lysosomes and degradation .

DIscUssIon NPxY - regulated integrin activation and trafficking 7 195 ectopic expression of CA - α 5 nor treat - ment with TS2 / 16 induces β 1 - dependent cell scattering and morphological changes . Moreover , although TS2 / 16 increases α 5 β 1 Y783A - mediated cell adhesion to FN , adhesion to FN in wild - type cells treated with TS2 / 16 is still higher , suggesting that even when activated , α 5 β 1 Y783A does not optimally support cell adhesion . These findings emphasize the importance of the MP - NPxY motif for post - activation events . The Y > A mutation in the MP - NPxY motif disrupts the binding of both talin and tensin , which are the principal connectors of α 5 β 1 to the actin cytoskeleton ( 29 , 30 ) . Hence , simultaneous loss of talin - and ten - sin - binding will prevent all α 5 β 1 - induced events that require cytoskeletal contractil - ity , including assembly of FAs and FBs , FN fibrillogenesis , and cell spreading , scatter - ing , and migration ( 31 - 34 ) . In addition , it likely also compromises cell adhesion , which is supported by the finding in D . melanogaster that integrins can bind ECM without talin but blister formation occurs nonetheless because there is no connec - tion to the cytoskeleton ( 9 ) . Talin - binding downstream of integrin activation is fur - thermore important to prevent recruit - ment of the negative regulator filamin ( 35 , 36 ) . The pivotal role of talin was confirmed by talin - 1 depletion in GE β 1 cells , which prevented cell scattering and induced a reversal to islands with intact cell - cell junctions . However , the islands formed by talin - 1 - depleted cells still con - tained some protrusions and occasional large peripheral FAs , presumably due to residual talin expression or partial com - pensation for the loss of talin by tensin . Surprisingly , mutation of the MD - NPxY did not abolish α 5 β 1 func - tion , despite massively increased deg - radation . In fact , with only 50 % of wild - type levels , α 5 β 1 Y795A induced the whole gamut of α 5 β 1 - induced events , probably because there is still some residual recy - cling . Importantly , these data show that an intact MD - NPxY is not absolutely required for α 5 β 1 function . A large accu - mulation of active integrins was detected in LE / lysosomes , both in GE β 1 Y795A and in GE β 1 Y783 / 795A cells , suggesting that even simultaneous disruption of both NPxY motifs does not completely prevent the adoption of the high - affinity conforma - tion . However , the MP - NPxY is clearly dominant for integrin function , because the phenotype of GE β 1 Y783 / 795A resembled that of GE β 1 Y783 , and expression of CA - α 5 or treatment with TS2 / 16 also failed to induce cell scattering in GE β 1 Y783 / 795A . Thus , GE β 1 Y783 / 795A cells contain the combined effects of both mutations ; impaired cell scattering , migration and FN fibrillogenesis due to disruption of the MP - NPxY , and increased degradation leading to low integrin expression , due to disruption of the MD - NPxY . Together , the two mutations reduce cell adhesion to that of β 1 - null cells . An important observation is that the absolute number of active conformers on the membrane , as judged by 9EG7 staining , is the same in GE β 1 Y783A and GE β 1 Y795A cells ( about 30 % of wild - type levels ) , whereas the phenotypes are strik - ingly different . This clearly demonstrates that the number of integrins in high - affin - ity conformation on the membrane does not predict their biological functional - ity , and emphasizes the importance of the internal integrin pool , as well as the dynamic regulation of integrin internal - 196 ization and recycling . We show here that both NPxY motifs in β 1 contribute to α 5 β 1 internalization , complementing a previous observation that integrin inter - nalization is reduced upon simultaneous mutation of the NPxY motifs ( 18 ) . Never - theless , there is still considerable residual internalization , supporting earlier findings that many integrins can be internalized in both a clathrin - dependent and a clathrin - independent fashion , and in particular with the observation that α 5 β 1 and FN are internalized via caveolae ( 21 ) . Intrigu - ingly , in addition to a role in integrin internalization , both NPxY motifs in β 1 regulate integrin recycling . Whereas the α 5 β 1 Y783A mutant is primarily localized at the membrane , the internal pool is small , which is in part caused by its decreased internalization , and in part by fast recy - cling back to the membrane . These data fit well with a recent study showing that inac - tive integrins are primarily at the mem - brane and hardly in vesicles , due to rapid recycling ( 20 ) . Thus , the rapid recycling of α 5 β 1 Y783A is possibly an indirect effect of its low activation - status . Our data support the well - established view of kindlins as co - activators for talin - induced integrin activation , as knockdown of both talin - 1 and kindlin - 2 reduced FN - binding by α 5 β 1 as well as cell adhe - sion , but depletion of talin - 1 had a much stronger effect than depletion of kindlin - 2 . However , downstream of integrin activa - tion , talin - 1 is important for cell scatter - ing while kindlin - 2 is dispensable . Fur - thermore , depletion of kindlin - 2 but not talin - 1 reduced cell - surface expression of α 5 β 1 , consistent with a number of obser - vations that cell - surface expression of several integrins is low in the absence of kindlins , whereas it is enhanced by kindlin overexpression ( 37 - 39 ) . The decrease in cell - surface levels was concomitant with enhanced α 5 β 1 accumulation in LE / lysosomes and degradation , but the reduc - tion of total α 5 β 1 protein levels was not as prominent as in GE β 1 Y795A , suggesting that kindlin - 2 knockdown does not completely recapitulate the MD - NPxY mutation . Inte - grin routing is likely regulated by distinct factors in different subcellular compart - ments . Indeed , whereas kindlin - 2 operates at the plasma membrane , two very recent reports have shown that upon internaliza - tion , sorting nexin - 17 binds the MD - NPxY motif in endosomes to prevent β 1 - contain - ing integrins from being delivered to LE / lysosomes ( 40 , 41 ) . Knockdown of sorting nexin - 17 leads to reduced integrin recy - cling , enhanced lysosomal degradation , and reduced cell - surface levels , much like mutation of the MD - NPxY motif . Never - theless , the two studies differ as to whether sorting nexin - 17 is important for the recy - cling of inactive integrins only , or whether it mediates the recycling of both active and inactive integrins ( 40 , 41 ) . Our data confirm the importance of the MD - NPxY in integrin trafficking and lysosomal degradation , and extend these observations to the role of the MP - NPxY , as well as the combined effects of both motifs in the regulation of integrin traf - ficking and integrin - regulated events such as cell scattering and migration . However , whereas our results indicate that deple - tion of kindlin - 2 increases α 5 β 1 degrada - tion , one of the mentioned reports did not find that kindlin - 2 regulates the degrada - tion of β 1 - integrins . Rather , the effects of kindlin - 2 on integrin cell - surface levels were attributed to transcriptional upregu - NPxY - regulated integrin activation and trafficking 7 197 lation of the β 1 - subunit ( 41 ) . The mecha - nisms of how kindlins regulate integrin expression will require further study . Of note , it was previously reported that the kindlin - mediated increase in α 5 β 1 cell - surface levels requires an intact integrin - binding site in kindlin , suggesting that a direct interaction between kindlin and β 1 is involved , at least for α 5 β 1 ( 37 ) . It will be important to resolve whether the mechanisms identified here apply only for α 5 β 1 or also for other β 1 - integrins . The rates of internalization and recycling differ greatly between different integrins , suggesting that integrin - specific effects are regulated in part by differences in the sequences of the α - subunits ( 42 ) . Indeed , accumulating evidence indicates that these recruit GTPases and other factors that control integrin trafficking and acti - vation . For example , Rab21 GTPase binds to α 2 and α 5 and promotes integrin recruitment to the endocytic machinery , and subsequent displacement of Rab21 by p120RasGAP leads to integrin recy - cling from early endosomes ( 43 , 44 ) . Future work should focus more on the dif - ferences in regulation between individual integrin heterodimers .

Cells were then washed twice in 2 % FCS / PBS , incubated with appropriate second - ary antibodies for 45 min at 4°C , washed twice in 2 % FCS / PBS , and analyzed on a FACS Calibur ( BD Biosciences ) . Alternatively , the cells were sorted on a MoFlo High Speed Cell Sorter ( Beckman Coulter ) . To assess FN binding , cells were incubated with Cy5 - conjugated FN ( 5 m g / ml ) in the presence of GRGDSP peptide ( 500 m g / ml ) , to block FN - bind - ing by endogenous α v β 3 . cell lysis and Western blotting Cells were washed in ice - cold PBS and lysed on ice in RIPA buffer ( 25 mM Tris / HCl pH 7 . 6 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS ) , supplemented with protease inhibi - tor cocktail ( Sigma ) . Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13 , 000x g , heated at 95ºC in SDS sample buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 6 . 8 , 2 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , 1 % β - mercaptoethanol , 12 . 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 02 % bromophenol blue ) , and proteins were resolved by SDS - PAGE , after which they were transferred to polyvinylidene NPxY - regulated integrin activation and trafficking 7 199 difluoride membranes ( Millipore ) and analyzed by Western blotting followed by ECL using the SuperSignal system ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) . Phase - contrast microscopy , confocal microscopy and total internal reflec - tion microscopy Phase - contrast images were acquired on a Zeiss microscope ( Axiovert 25 ) at 10x ( NA 0 . 25 ) or 20x ( NA 0 . 3 ) magnifica - tion , using a Zeiss CCD camera ( Axiocam MRC ) and Zeiss Mr . Grab 1 . 0 software . For confocal microscopy of fixed cells , cells were prepared on coverslips as pre - viously described ( 25 ) , and images were acquired on an inverted confocal micro - scope ( Leica AOBS ) using 20x ( NA 0 . 7 ) dry , 40x ( NA 1 . 25 ) oil , and 63x ( NA 1 . 32 ) oil objectives ( Leica ) . Live - cell confocal movies of cells on glass - bottomed 3 - cm plates were acquired using a 64x objec - tive on an inverted confocal microscope ( Fluoview FV1000 , Olympus ) , at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 . TIRF movies of cells on glass coverslips were acquired using Leica application suite software on a Leica DMI600B system with a 63X objective ( NA 1 . 47 ) , at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 . Images and movies were processed using Photoshop 7 . 0 and ImageJ 1 . 44 . Quantification of co - localization , fas , and cell spreading Colocalization between α 5 and LAMP - 1 was determined from confocal images as described previously ( 23 ) . Confocal images of P ( Y ) / F - actin stainings were acquired using fixed settings , background - subtracted and thresholded in ImageJ 1 . 44 , and FA size and number were then determined using the ‘analyze particles’ function . Cell area was quantified from the F - actin - channel , and the adhesive area was determined as the total FA area / cell area . Values shown represent the averages of 2000 - 9000 FAs from ~ 30 cells . Migration and adhesion assays For single - cell migration assays , cells were sparsely seeded on 10 m g / ml FN , and phase - contrast images were captured every 15 min at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 on a Widefield CCD system using a 10x dry lens objective ( Carl Zeiss MicroImag - ing ) . Migration tracks were generated using ImageJ 1 . 44 , and the average veloc - ity was calculated from ~ 250 cells out of 3 independent experiments . For adhesion assays , 96 - well plates were coated with 10 m g / ml FN , washed with PBS , and blocked with 2 % BSA . Cells were seeded at a density of 3x10 4 per well in DMEM with GRGDSP peptide ( 500 m g / ml ) , with or without TS2 / 16 ( 10 m g / ml ) . After 30 min at 37°C , nonadherent cells were washed away with PBS . Remaining cells were fixed in 4 % PFA , washed with H2O , stained with crystal violet , washed , and lysed in 2 % SDS . Absorbance was measured at 490 nm . Residual adhesion of GE11 cells was subtracted from all other cell lines . Integrin internalization , recycling , and degradation assays Integrin internalization , recycling , and degradation were investigated essentially as described earlier ( 10 , 23 ) . Briefly , cells were stimulated with fresh DMEM / FCS 1 hr prior to the assay , transferred to ice , washed twice in PBS and surface - labeled at 4ºC with 130 m g / ml NHS - SS - biotin for 30 min . For internalization , cells were transferred to DMEM / FCS at 37ºC in the presence of 0 . 6 mM primaquine , 200 after which they were washed twice with ice - cold PBS , and remaining cell - surface biotin was removed by reduction with sodium 2 - mercaptoethanesulphonate ( MesNa ) . After washing in PBS , cells were lysed in 1 . 5 NDLB buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris , 10 mM NaF , 1 . 5 mM Na3VO3 , 5 mM EDTA , 5 mM EGTA , 1 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 75 % Igepal CA - 630 , 50 m g / ml leupeptin , 50 m g / ml aprotinin , and 1 mM 4 - ( 2 - aminoethyl ) benzynesulphonyl fluoride ) . For recycling assays , internalization was performed for 15 min in the absence of primaquine , after which the cells were washed with PBS , and remaining cell - surface biotin was removed with MesNa . Recycling of internalized proteins was then induced in DMEM / FCS at 37ºC , whereafter biotin was removed from recycled proteins by a second reduction with MEsNa , which was quenched with 20 mM iodoacetamide . The second reduction was omitted to detect degradation of the internal pool . Cells were then washed twice in PBS and lysed in 1 . 5 NDLB buffer . To measure degradation in steady - state conditions , cells were washed in PBS , surface - labeled at 4ºC with NHS - SS - biotin , washed in PBS , and transferred to DMEM / FCS at 37ºC , after which they were lysed in 1 . 5 NDLB buffer at the indicated time - points . capture elIsa Maxisorb 96 - well plates ( Life Technolo - gies ) were coated overnight with 5 μg / ml anti - integrin α 5 or anti - TfnR in 0 . 05 M Na 2 CO 3 pH 9 . 6 at 4ºC and blocked in PBS / 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 ( PBS - T ) with 5 % BSA . Plates were incubated overnight with cell lysates at 4ºC , washed with PBS - T , and incubated with HRP - streptavidin in PBS - T / 1 % BSA for 1 hr at 4ºC . After washing , biotinylated proteins were detected with ortho - phenylenediamine in a buffer con - taining 25 . 4 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 12 . 3 mM citric acid ( pH 5 . 4 ) , and 0 . 003 % H 2 O 2 . The reac - tion was terminated with 8 M H 2 SO 4 and absorbance was read at 490 nm . statistical analysis Graphs were generated either in Excel or in GraphPad Prism 5 . 01 , and statistical analysis was perfomed using unpaired t - tests .
