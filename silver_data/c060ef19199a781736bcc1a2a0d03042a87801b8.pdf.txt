The WASP sequence also contains a putative nuclear localization signal and an acidic C - terminal do - main ( Derry et al . , 1994 ) . By cell fractionation , WASP has been shown to be cytosolic with low levels in the nucleus ( Rivero - Lezcano et al . , 1995 ) . Here we report that WASP has a GTPase - binding site that is similar to those found in Rac / CDC42Hs effector proteins and show that it interacts specifically with acti - vated CDC42Hs . In different cell types , WASP localizes in clusters that are enriched in polymerized actin and are regulated by CDC42Hs . In addition , we also identi - fied novel domains on WASP that are conserved among proteins that are involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . Our study provides a link between a mem - ber of the Rho family , its effector WASP , and the control of actin polymerization and suggests a possible mecha - nism for defects of WAS that are associated with actin cytoskeleton abnormalities . Results A 62 kDa CDC42Hs - Binding Protein in Neutrophils Is Identical to WASP By utilizing an overlay method , we recently identified three proteins in human neutrophil cytosol that bind the activated GTPase CDC42Hs ( Martin et al . , 1995 ) .

In contrast , hPAK65 interacts strongly with the GTP - bound forms of both query . Interestingly , in addition to PAK - related proteins such as STE20 , CLA4 , and Shk1 ( Cvrckova et al . , 1995 ; Rac1 and CDC42Hs . No binding was detected for GST WASP Is an Effector for CDC42Hs 725 Expression of WASP Induces Ectopic Actin Polymerization To determine the subcellular distribution of WASP , we performed transient transfection of normal rat kidney ( NRK ) epithelial cells with FLAG epitope – tagged WASP . Examination of the cells 40 – 48 hr posttransfection showed cytoplasmic staining in most of the transfected cells . In a small minority ( < 5 % ) , only the nucleus was labeled . Cells expressing low levels of WASP displayed a punctate pattern of WASP staining , whereas higher expressing cells showed extended cluster formation of WASP - containing particles ( Figure 3A ) . Dual labeling with phalloidin , a fungal toxin specific for filamentous actin ( F - actin ) , revealed a striking colocalization of WASP with polymerized actin , both for the small WASP - containing particles and the larger clusters ( Figure 3B ) . This costaining was not seen for all actin structures in the cell ; none of the endogenous stress fibers , for instance , were clearly labeled with the anti - FLAG anti - body , although all regions labeled with anti - FLAG anti - body also contained F - actin . Transfected cells express - ing very high levels of WASP showed a reduction in the number of stress fibers , indicating a disruption of the endogenous actin cytoskeleton . To determinethe regionof WASP responsible foractin cluster formation , we transfected cells with a construct containing a 443 amino acid , C - terminally truncated WASP ( WASP (cid:68) C ) . In WASP (cid:68) C - transfected cells , the flu - orescent labeling was much more uniformly distributed ; punctate staining throughout the cytoplasm could only be detectedin cells withhighlevels ofexpression ( Figure 3C ) , and colocalization with polymerized actin could not be unambiguously detected ( Figure 3D ) . Similar results were obtained using transient transfection of monkey COS7 cells ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that WASP C - terminal 59 amino acids are implicated in the control of actin polymerization or localization of WASP Figure 2 .

Taken together , these in vivo results are consistent with strong inhibition in the formation of extended clusters ( compare Figures 5A and 5C ) , suggesting that the clus - the specific in vitro interaction of WASP with CDC42Hs , its much weaker binding to Rac , and its lack of interac - tering process is dependent on actin polymerization .

In addition to the GBD , we identified two distinct sequences in WASP in the N - terminal and podia and promoted highly characteristic bundling of stress fibers in PAE cells ( Figure 7A ) , consistent with in C - terminal regions of WASP that are conserved in several proline - rich proteins known to be involved in the earlier observations indicating that CDC42Hs activates a GTPase cascade comprised of Rac and Rho ( Nobes organization of actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 8A ) . Because these regions were originally identified in WASP , we and Hall , 1995 ) . Expression of WASP , even atlow levels , strongly inhibitedthisphenotype ( Figure 7B ) . Expression propose that these putative domains be termed WASP homology 1 and 2 ( WH1 andWH2 ) domains . The domain of constitutively active Rac1 - V12 in PAE cells caused a very similar phenotype to that of CDC42Hs - V12 , except structures of proteins that contained WH1 and WH2 are shown in Figure 8B . WH1 is situated nearthe N - terminus that stress fiber bundling was less marked ( Figure 7C ) . WASP at low expression levels did not interfere with of the identified proteins , followed by a long repetitive polyproline sequence . Incontrast , the WH2motif follows this phenotype ( left cell in Figure 7D ) , but at expression levels high enough to lead to extensive clustering WASP a polyproline sequence located near the N - terminus .

Our in vitro Cell730 tively active CDC42Hs - V12 is most readily explained by assuming that CDC42Hs normally activates Rac and that overexpressed WASP acts in a dominant negative fashion by sequestering activated CDC42Hs . The clinical features of WAS also support a link be - tween WASP function and the actin cytoskeleton . The most common clinical manifestation is severe thrombo - cytopenia . One possible mechanism for this could be that mutations in the WASP gene lead to abnormal cy - toskeletal rearrangement in the megakaryocyte , which results in defective platelet formation . Abnormalities of platelet shape or surface features are recognized by the spleen , which sequesters and destroys these platelets , thereby releasing abnormal microplatelets into the cir - culation . After splenectomy , circulating platelets are re - stored to normal size and numbers ( Mullen et al . , 1993 ) . Profound immunodeficiency involving B and T cells and recurrent infections are associated with the syn - drome ( Ochs et al . , 1980 ) .

Taken together , the effects of WASP on the cy - for CDC42 are currently unknown . It is likely , however , toskeleton and the specific interaction with CDC42Hs that some of these effectors share properties with provide an explanation for the T cell abnormalities ob - WASP . served in WAS . WASP contains polyproline regions that may interact WASP expressionwas originallyfoundto be restricted with SH3 - containing proteins as previously suggested to cells of lymphoid , erythroblastic , and megakaryocytic ( Derry et al . , 1994 , 1995b ) . Indeed , the SH3 domain of origin ( Derry et al . , 1994 ) . We have now also detected NCK was recently found to bind WASP ( Rivero - Lezcano WASP / p62 in neutrophilandmacrophage cytosol , which et al . , 1995 ) . NCK also interacts with another Rac / raises the possibility that WASP plays a role in the orga - CDC42Hs effector protein , mouse PAK3 ( Bagrodia et nization of the phagocyte cytoskeleton . It has been re - al . , 1995 ) , and with tyrosine kinase receptors ( Li et al . , ported that chemotactic responses of neutrophils from 1992 ) . Thisraises thepossibility that WASPfunction may WAS patients are abnormal ( Ochs et al . , 1980 ) , poten - also be regulated by tyrosine kinase signaling pathways tially as a direct result of a defect in WASP - regulated ( Figure 9 ) . In addition to the SH3 - binding domain , WASP actin polymerization . In this regard , it is interesting to contains longer repeated proline - rich sequences , typi - note that some chemokines signal through G protein – cally four to five consecutive residues with one stretch coupled receptors . In the yeast S . cerevisiae , the G pro - tein – coupled pheromone receptor signals to both the of 11 prolines . The role of repetitive proline sequences WASP Is an Effector for CDC42Hs 731 is still uncertain . In several instances , they have been of VASP typically appear as Gly ( Pro ) 5 , and three of the four copies are in a tandem repeat configuration . More - shown to be involved in association of multiple protein complexes ( Williamson , 1994 ) . Interestingly , we were over , a peptide corresponding to the VASP Gly ( Pro ) 5 tandem repeat competes with VASP in binding to pro - able to identify in the database two additional se - quences that contain a GBD consensus sequence and a filin , supporting thenotion that thisregion is importantin VASP – profilin binding ( Haffneretal . , 1995 ) . Interestingly , proline - rich domain and are not related to PAK proteins . Both sequences encode long proline repeats , one of hWASP also contains a Gly ( Pro ) 5 sequence ( Derry et al . , 1994 ) while the mouse protein contains two such motifs which reveals sequence homology to a vinculin - related protein from a lower organism ( data not shown ) . It is ( Derry et al . , 1995b ) , suggesting that the effect of WASP on actin polymerization may be mediated through a di - interesting to note that the GBD has thus far only been found in PAK - related kinases and in proteins containing rect interaction between WASP and profilin . Three models have been proposed for the role of proline repeats , suggesting that these proline - rich pro - teins may represent novel GTPase targets that have VASP / profilin in actin polymerization . In the first model , VASP - bound profilin may regulate actin polymerization similar functions . We also identified two novel putative domains in by dissociating actin to increase the local concentration of free actin . In the second model , VASP and profilin WASP , WH1 and WH2 , that are conserved among sev - eral proline - rich proteins . Some of these WH1 / WH2 - interaction may lead to actin dissociation , followed by the formation of actinfilaments . Inthe third model , VASP containing proteins were shown to be involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton : Vasodilator - stimu - may be involved in stimulating the exchange of ATP on actin ( Pollard , 1995 ; Theriot and Mitchison , 1993 ) . In lated phosphoprotein ( VASP ) was shown to be impli - cated in actin polymerization ( Haffner et al . , 1995 ) , and addition , VASP wasdetected atstressfibers , focaladhe - sions , and cell surface protrusions ( Haffner et al . , 1995 ) , verprolinwas shownto play a rolein cytoskeletal organi - zation and cellular growth in S . cerevisiae ( Donnelly et whereas the C - terminally truncatedVASP failed to local - ize to these sites . In this study , we have provided evi - al . , 1993 ) . In addition , ENA , the protein product of the Drosophila gene enabled , is involved in axonal architec - dence that the C - terminal 59 amino acids of WASP are involved in the formation of WASP clusters and actin ture , consistent with a role in regulation of actin cy - toskeleton ( Gertler et al 1995 ) . The fact that WH1 and polymerization . An alternative interpretation of our re - sults is that the C - terminally truncated WASP (cid:68) C protein WH2 are conserved among polyproline - rich proteins thatare implicated incytoskeletal organization suggests is not folded properly , thereby disrupting its normal function . However , if it is indeed the case that the that theyrepresent novel functionaldomainsassociated with the cytoskeleton . It is likely that the identified WH1 / C - terminal region of WASP is directly involved in actin polymerization , similar to the C - terminal region of VASP , WH2 - containing proteins may alsobe regulated byRho - like GTPases via the interaction with a domain that is these regions may contain domains necessary for local - ization of these proteins to distinct sites in the cell . The different from the putative GBD . It is tempting to specu - late that WH1 / WH2 domains may be involved in linking structural similaritiesbetween VASP and WASP suggest that they may play related roles in actin polymerization . proline - rich proteins that are regulated by GTPases to structural components of the cytoskeleton . In summary , this study provides a link between the GTPase CDC42Hs , its effector WASP , and actin poly - Mutations in WASP that affect domains identified as having functional importance in this study have been merization and demonstrates the pivotal role of CDC42 in the regulationof twopathways , aMAP kinasecascade found in WAS patients . The WH1 domain , encoded by exons 2 and 3 , contains mostof the missense mutations leading to transcription activation and a second path - way linking to the cytoskeleton that in hematopoietic identified to date . Eleven consensus amino acids have been mutated in patients with either thrombocytopenia cells involves WASP ( Figure 9 ) . The elucidation of the biochemical mechanism by which WASP and CDC42Hs or classical WAS ( Derry et al . , 1994 , 1995a ; Kolluri et al . , 1995 ; Zhu et al . , 1995 ; Wengler et al . , 1995 ; Kwan et al . , regulate actin polymerization will contribute to our un - derstanding of the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . 1995 ) . The GBD , encoded by parts of exons 7 and 8 , has been disrupted in a single patient with classical WAS ( Derry et al . , 1995a ) . In the C - terminal 59 amino Experimental Procedures acids , encoded by exons 10 to 12 , missense mutations Protein Purification and Peptide Sequencing not involving the WH2 domain have been identified in p62 was purified from human neutrophil cytosol by sequential chro - patients with thrombocytopenia as well as with severe matography steps , including Mono Q , phenyl – Superose , and Mono WAS , while mutations leading to premature termination S columns , essentially as described previously for p65 ( Martin et of protein synthesis in this region are associated with al . , 1995 ) .
