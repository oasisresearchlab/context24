Abstract : Over the last few years , cryo electron microscopy has become the most important method in structural biology . While 80 % of deposited maps are from single particle analysis , electron tomography has grown to become the second most important method . In particular sub - tomogram averaging has matured as a method , delivering structures between 2 and 5 Å from complexes in cells as well as in vitro complexes . While this resolution range is not standard , novel developments point toward a promising future . Here , we provide a guide for the workﬂow from sample to structure to gain insight into this emerging ﬁeld . Keywords : protein complexes ; structural biology ; electron microscopy 1 . Introduction 1 . 1 . Structural Biology of Macro - Molecular Complexes Biological structures , from organs and tissues to cells and molecules , are major deter - minants of biological function . This deterministic / teleonomic view is the basic tenet of structural biology [ 1 ] . Today we have an arsenal of techniques to generate structures . Med - ical ( X - ray and MRI ) scanners capture organs and tissues . Light microscopic techniques image tissues and cells . Finally , structure biological methods determine the structures of proteins and the complexes they form . The moment protein structures became available , the idea that proteins are molecular machines , with sidechains as cogwheels , became tangible . One of the ﬁrst examples was the visualization of cooperativity in hemoglobin , where the movement of residues in another subunit inﬂuences the activity of the catalytic center [ 2 , 3 ] . Structures do not exist in a vacuum but are part of a functional network . Yet , structures , even if they are related , may confer different biological activities [ 4 ] . Therefore , the context of a structure within its functional unit is important to understand its role and vice versa . Traditional structural biological techniques are examples of a reductionist approach mostly to reduce the complexity of the investigated system . Single molecules , even if they exist in heteromeric assemblies , are isolated from expression systems and rarely from natural sources . X - ray crystallography requires high concentrations and high purity of the investigated sample . Because crystallization is sensitive to environmental factors , progress was restricted for a long time . Membrane proteins were particularly challenging , as well as large heterogenous complexes ; this changed when the structure of the photosynthetic reaction center became available in 1985 [ 5 ] . Structures of megadalton - size molecular machines , like the ribosome , were solved even later [ 6 ] . Although impressive , these structures are still highly pure samples in highly optimized buffers . Visualizing ligand interactions ( in the same crystal ) is possible in X - ray crystallography , as long as they do not impair the order / integrity of the crystal . Otherwise , the crystallization process must be optimized again . Int . J . Mol .

Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6177 2 of 14 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy ( NMR ) offers beneﬁts over X - ray crystal - lography . NMR can deliver a dynamic picture of interactions within the sample . This opens the possibility of studying the interaction of proteins with other biomolecules , like lipids , nucleotides or other ligands in situ . The study of intrinsically disordered parts of a protein is possible as well . Structural determination of a sample is possible in solution [ 7 ] as well as in solid state [ 8 ] . The latter presents the opportunity to study long polymers like ﬁbrils . However , NMR requires high concentrations of the sample and , in the case of solution state NMR , high solubility of the sample . The feasibility of resonance peak assignment restricts the size of the investigated protomer . Speciﬁc labelling of amino acids , residues or atoms allows the investigation of larger complexes , but de novo structures of ( > 100 kD ) large ( single ) proteins is still out of reach . However , NMR has enabled us to obtain a dynamic picture of proteins with their ( near ) natural interfaces , like membranes [ 9 ] . In order to understand the function of complexes , we have to image them in the context of their natural environment . Light microscopy has made big strides in recent years with methods that go beyond the diffraction limit of the light . These techniques produce stunning images of cells and organelles and their sub - structures at resolutions between 10 and 70 nm ; however , sub 10 nm resolution is possible [ 10 ] . There is a resolution gap between light microscopy and X - ray crystallography / NMR . Fortunately , this resolution ( and visualization ) gap can be bridged by electron microscopy ( Figure 1A ) . Electron microscopy ( EM ) is an imaging technique that encompasses a variety of applications , some of which are elaborated herein . The main advantage of EM is the fact that electron microscopes produce images from which high - resolution structures are extracted . Of special interest is transmission electron microscopy , where images are 2D projections of a 3D sample [ 11 ] . Because EM is generating images , a wide range of samples can be investigated by EM , from single ( protein ) molecules to organelles and cells ( Figure 1 ) . EM has seen immense growth . Since 2008 , the number of maps has doubled every two years ( e . g . , see Figure 1 ) . As a result , this technique has received wide recognition in the public and industry . Of the entries into the EM database ( emdb . org ) , 80 % are maps from single particle analysis ( SPA ) studies . Advances in data acquisition , image processing and analysis resulted in structures that routinely achieve a resolution of 3 – 5 Å ; however , < 2 Å structures are possible [ 12 ] . The imaged samples can be as small as 64 – 52 kDa [ 13 , 14 ] . It is difﬁcult to keep track of which size or resolution record has been broken , but it is safe to say that < 100 kDa proteins can be resolved with affordable instruments to resolutions that allow de novo model building [ 15 ] . For a detailed review of this technique , see other articles in this issue . While the above achievements deserve praise , the full potential of electron microscopy as a technique remains veiled . EM can image multiple states of a protein simultaneously , which can be resolved and placed in an energetic landscape [ 16 , 17 ] . More importantly , sample preparation allows a broad range of specimens to be imaged , allowing for the structural determination of proteins from natural sources . This may lead to the revision of ﬁndings from structures isolated out of sophisticated expression systems [ 18 ] . For SPA - related studies , it is important that the particles exhibit relative uniformity or order . This requirement is particularly true for the investigation of macromolecular assemblies like protein - decorated ﬁlaments or viral envelopes . Although SPA alleviates some of the shortcomings of other structural biology methods , namely the relative ease with which molecular machines can be imaged , SPA samples are still derived from complex puriﬁcation schemes . Each puriﬁcation scheme selects for the most stable complexes . There are means to stabilize more transient complexes for EM [ 19 ] . Puriﬁcation also removes the investigated sample from its natural interaction and functional network . As a result , transient interactions or weak interactions , e . g . , to lipids and cofactors , get lost . The protein interaction network contains not only information about binding partners but also information about the localization within the cell or compartment . Unless speciﬁc markers can be retrieved , cellular localization information is permanently lost during puriﬁcation . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6177 3 of 14 Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 15 tions , e . g . , to lipids and cofactors , get lost . The protein interaction network contains not only information about binding partners but also information about the localization within the cell or compartment . Unless specific markers can be retrieved , cellular locali - zation information is permanently lost during purification . Figure 1 .

Electron Tomography The reconstruction of a 3D structure out of 2D ( projection ) images hinges on the determination of the angles between projections from particles ( or their averages ) . While crystallographic order was used to solve the first structure of a multi - protein complex by EM , the authors have already suggested that the collection of the same particle at dif - ferent tilt angles can lead to a structure and can be expanded to “unsymmetrical particles , or sections of biological specimens” [ 11 ] . Collecting images at predetermined angles is one of the earliest methods of generating an SPA de novo structure without prior knowledge of the sample [ 20 ] . The real power of this approach is the fact that it can be applied to any sample , and it will result in a 3D structure , even if there is only a single copy of the specimen in the image . Yet , if the specimen has low or no symmetry , a min - imum number of ( tilted ) views is necessary , and the achievable resolution depends on the total number of tilted images [ 11 , 21 ] . If we want to generate images at different tilt angles ( tilt series ) and calculate a structure from the tilt series ( electron tomogram ) , we need to overcome multiple challenges ( Figure 2 ) . First , the specimen has to stay at the center of the image during data collection so one can align the same structure over all tilt angles . Second , the sample has to be thin enough to be penetrated by the beam , even at high tilt angles . Third , the imaged sample has to be beam resistant , because it has to en - dure multiple exposures . The latter is an inherent problem of biological samples . One solution to this problem is embedding the sample in heavy metal salts . However , staining is not a perfect solution ; the grain size of the stain limits the ultimate resolution of the Figure 1 .

The latter is an inherent problem of biological samples . One solution to this problem is embedding the sample in heavy metal salts . However , staining is not a perfect solution ; the grain size of the stain limits the ultimate resolution of the tomogram , the sample still experiences damage [ 22 , 23 ] , and areas that are inaccessible to the stain are “invisible” . The discovery of sample vitriﬁcation and the preservation of biological samples at cryogenic temperatures [ 24 ] made it possible to collect tilt series to create cryo - electron tomograms ( CT ) .

Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6177 4 of 14 cameras , which allowed the automatization of the different steps in the collection of a tilt series ( tilting , tracking ) [ 25 ] . However , the accumulation of electrons in the sample over the collection of a whole tilt series ( 30 – 40 images ) is still a problem . Doses of 120 – 160e − / Å 2 cause extensive damage ( visible by bubbling of the ice [ 23 ] ) and the loss of high - resolution features , e . g . , decarboxylation of side chains [ 26 ] . A proof of concept study showed that it is possible to image at low doses and reconstruct samples in vitreous ice [ 27 ] . It took another ﬁve years until the ﬁrst cryo - tomograms of organelles and organelle - derived vesicles were reported [ 28 , 29 ] . With this technique at hand , electron microscopy is able to investigate macromolecular machines in reconstituted systems ( in vitro ) , isolated from cells ( ex situ ) , or inside cells ( in situ ) . The same advances that propelled SPA to where it stands today beneﬁtted cryo - electron tomography ( cryoET ) . This is reﬂected by the increase of cryo - tomograms submitted ( Figure 1C ) as well as the drop of the resolution from cryoET derived structures ( Figure 1B ) . This is true for in situ cryoET as well as cryoET for other samples ( Figure 3 ) . The ease with which CTs are recorded and reconstructed makes cryoET a quality - control tool to assess the accumulation of proteins at the air - water interface and the ice thickness [ 30 ] . Int .

Consideration for the Collection of Cryo - Electron Tomograms 2 . 1 . Sample Preparation in CryoET Generally , samples in cryoET are either reconstituted specimens from purified components ( e . g . , protein bound to microtubules or membranes ) or cells and cell com - ponents ( Figure 3 ) . In either case , the thickness of the sample is a concern , because the mean free path for inelastic scattering is about 300 – 400 nm ( for a 300 kV microscope ) [ 31 ] . Logically , at higher tilt angles the ice thickness increases ( along the beam axis ) . Thicker ice increases the likelihood of inelastic scattering , which increases background noise . Therefore , thinner samples yield better data ( ideally < 100 nm ) . Yet , the ice layer should encompass the structure of interest . The latter is obviously a concern for cells or cell - derived samples , as many substructures exceed 100 nm thickness . Samples up to 5 µm thickness can be vitrified [ 24 ] with plunge freeze devices and thinned later if necessary ( Figure 4 ) . With these requirements , dispersed molecular com - plexes fare better , because blotting parameters can be adjusted to create ice as thin as possible . In vitro samples like this have achieved sub 5Å resolution , either as part of as - semblies [ 32 , 33 ] or as single copies [ 34 , 35 ] ( see Figure 3 ) . The latter is as close to the res - olution of the same ( ~ 300 kDa ) particle as solved with SPA . Figure 3 . Examples of the improvement in resolution of sub - tomogram averaging maps .

Data Collection Automatizing the collection of tilt series has been an important step in the devel - opment of cryoET . This achievement would have not been possible without the intro - duction of coupled charge device ( CCD ) cameras during the time when photographic film was the medium of choice . CCD cameras digitize the signal immediately , but they have three significant shortcomings compared to photographic film : first , the detective quantum efficiency ( DQE ) is lower than photographic film ; second , the recorded area is fairly small compared to film ; third , CCD cameras do not detect electrons directly . Due to the lower dose per image and the scarcity of unique particles per image , cryoET was more limited by CCD cameras than SPA . But cryoEM was revolutionized by the intro - duction of complementary metal oxide semiconductor ( CMOS ) cameras with direct electron detectors ( DEDs ) . The benefit of these cameras is twofold : a fast readout and a higher DQE ( for a comparison of different recording media , see [ 57 ] ) . The high frame rate allows the fractionation of electron dose over many frames and the correction of sample movement ( Figure 2B ) . Multiple frame collection ( i . e . , movies ) has been crucial in SPA to solve maps of proteins to atomic resolution . The case of cryoET dose fractionation during the collection of tilt series is more challenging . The overall dose per image in a tilt series is about 10 – 20 times lower compared to the single exposure of an SPA image . Thus , the in - itial alignment of single frames is more difficult and relies on fiducial markers ( like col - loidal gold ) ; therefore , a high frame rate with current instrumentation is not beneficial . Figure 4 . Schematic workﬂow for sample preparation and data collection . Samples can be isolated complexes , cell compartments or cells grown / settled on grids . After excess liquid is blotted away , the sample is plunge - frozen ( high - pressure freezing is excluded here ) . If samples are sufﬁciently thin , one can proceed to collection of tilt series right away . Cells and thick samples can be processed with focused ion beam milling ( beige box ) . The SEM image shows a cell on holey carbon . During the milling process ( see middle graphic illustration ) , cell material is ablated by sputtering Ga2 + ions on the cell with an ion gun ( yellow ) . As a result , we obtain a lamella thin enough for imaging ( lower picture ) . The SEM images were kindly provided by Prof Linda Sandblad , Umeå Core Facility for Electron Microscopy . The ultimate goal of cryoET is the structural study of proteins in a natural / physiological environment . To avoid the conﬁning thickness of cells , model systems are used to maintain part of the native interaction network for structural studies . Structural studies can be conducted with bacteria [ 36 ] , bacterial mini cells [ 37 , 38 ] , protrusion of cells ( e . g . , [ 39 ] ) , frac - tionated cellular compartments like mitochondria [ 40 ] , ﬂagella [ 41 ] , various vesicles [ 42 , 43 ] and viruses [ 44 , 45 ] . This list is not complete but shows the options researchers have without being limited by complete ( eukaryotic ) cells . If we want to image isolated tissues , cells or cell compartments , we have to overcome two potential issues . First , if the sample is thicker than 5 µ m , plunge freezing does not ensure the generation of vitreous ice throughout the sample . High - pressure freezing is the method of choice for larger specimens ( e . g . , [ 46 ] ) . This method is able to cryo - preserve tissue samples or even small organisms like C . elegans [ 47 ] . Second , regardless of the freezing method , a thinning of the sample is necessary to make it suitable for cryoEM . CryoEM Of Vitreous Sections ( CEMOVIS ) was the ﬁrst solution to generate samples thin enough for cryoET [ 48 ] . In short , the sample is cooled to maintain water in vitreous form and then cut with a diamond blade to obtain a thin ﬁlm . The ﬁlm is deposited on a grid and imaged . This method has two disadvantages : the cutting procedure generates surface artefacts and the blade compresses the sample . Recently , a modiﬁed method , using re - vitriﬁcation of sections , delivered in situ structures of viruses in cells with a resolution of ~ 5 nm [ 49 ] . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6177 7 of 14 Another sample preparation method takes advantage of an approach used in material science . Here , a focused ion beam ( FIB ) of sputtered heavy ions is used to remove layers of the sample [ 50 ] . Dual beam instruments are used to monitor the process ( and image the sample ) . The method has been improved to generate lamellae in different shapes and positions within cells ( Figure 4 , box ) . The value of this approach was demonstrated by imaging and reconstructing COPI vesicles and the cellular machinery around amyloid ﬁbers in cells , just to name two examples [ 51 , 52 ] . In both cases it was possible to localize , identify and classify COPI coats and proteasomes . At a pixel size of about 3 . 5 Å , the imaged area is about 1 µ m × 1 µ m . Thus , it is crucial to identify areas of interest for FIB milling or imaging . Fluorescence microscopy under cryo conditions is now routinely used to target areas for imaging on the grid [ 53 , 54 ] . Due to sample restrictions , standard correlative light and electron microscopy ( CLEM ) setups are no more than tools to ﬁnd areas of interest . However , efforts to take advantage of high - resolution light microscopic methods like cryoSIM or Cryo - SOFI can help to interpret cryoET data in the larger context of the cell [ 55 , 56 ] . 2 . 2 . Data Collection Automatizing the collection of tilt series has been an important step in the develop - ment of cryoET . This achievement would have not been possible without the introduction of coupled charge device ( CCD ) cameras during the time when photographic ﬁlm was the medium of choice . CCD cameras digitize the signal immediately , but they have three signiﬁcant shortcomings compared to photographic ﬁlm : ﬁrst , the detective quantum efﬁciency ( DQE ) is lower than photographic ﬁlm ; second , the recorded area is fairly small compared to ﬁlm ; third , CCD cameras do not detect electrons directly . Due to the lower dose per image and the scarcity of unique particles per image , cryoET was more limited by CCD cameras than SPA . But cryoEM was revolutionized by the introduction of complemen - tary metal oxide semiconductor ( CMOS ) cameras with direct electron detectors ( DEDs ) . The beneﬁt of these cameras is twofold : a fast readout and a higher DQE ( for a compari - son of different recording media , see [ 57 ] ) . The high frame rate allows the fractionation of electron dose over many frames and the correction of sample movement ( Figure 2B ) . Multiple frame collection ( i . e . , movies ) has been crucial in SPA to solve maps of proteins to atomic resolution . The case of cryoET dose fractionation during the collection of tilt series is more challenging . The overall dose per image in a tilt series is about 10 – 20 times lower compared to the single exposure of an SPA image . Thus , the initial alignment of single frames is more difﬁcult and relies on ﬁducial markers ( like colloidal gold ) ; therefore , a high frame rate with current instrumentation is not beneﬁcial . Because the resolution of cryoET depends on the number of views ( or images at different tilt angles ) , it is desirable to take as many images as possible . However , me - chanical limitations of the specimen stage and the total permissible radiation dose restrict experimental options . Most microscopes are able to tilt ± 60 ◦ . Due to these restrictions in the tilt geometry , tilt series miss data ( missing wedge ) . This could be mitigated by tilting the sample in X and Y . However , this solution is not feasible for cryoET due to the accumulated dose . Traditionally , tilt series were collected in ascending ( or descending ) increments ( e . g . , from − 60 ◦ to 60 ◦ or vice versa ) to minimize the stage displacement from one tilt angle to the next , which reduces the time needed to track stage errors . However , the image quality suffers from low to high tilt angles due to the increase in ice thickness . As a consequence , the sample is exposed to electrons without generating images with high - resolution data . Therefore , Hagen et al . devised a scheme to collect data at low tilt angles ﬁrst , before collecting high tilt angle data [ 58 ] . The trade - off is a slower pace of data collection and the necessity of a high precision stage ( e . g . , to reduce the tracking error ) . While camera speed has increased dramatically , most of the time during a tilt series is spent moving and tracking the stage . Modern stages , dedicated to cryoET , are more precise , which allows data collection schemes that skip stage corrections . As a result , tilt series can be collected within 5 min [ 59 , 60 ] . It is not clear if these cryoETs are suitable for Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6177 8 of 14 high - resolution structure generation . Bouvette et al . introduced an interesting scheme . The stage corrections are still performed for each tilt , but multiple positions are imaged with beam - induced image - shift [ 34 ] . The resulting cryoETs are of high quality and allow structures of smaller ( 300 kD ) proteins to be solved to a resolution < 4 Å . DED cameras and motion correction improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) after the image has been formed in the microscope . The generation of contrast in a microscope is mathematically described by the contrast transfer function ( CTF ) . Usually , contrast is generated by defocusing the microscope . Due to the low SNR in tilt series , the defocus values are high ( > 3 – 6 µ m ) . As a consequence of the CTF , the signal is subjected to a low - pass ﬁlter ( for the modelling of the CTF see , e . g . , [ 61 ] ) . To make things worse , cryoET samples are generally thicker than SPA samples , and thus inelastically scattered electrons are more likely . Removing them with appropriate devices ( energy ﬁlters ) improves the contrast of images signiﬁcantly [ 62 ] . Energy ﬁlters are either part of the microscope ( in - column ﬁlters ) or after the microscope and in front of the camera . Another technical device that enhances the contrast is the phase plate ( for a review , see [ 63 ] ) . Currently , the most common phase plate is the volta phase plate ( VPP ) . VPPs have been used for the collection of SPA data as well as cryoET . However , the verdict on the beneﬁt of VPPs for high - resolution structures , for instance for G - protein coupled receptors , is still out ( e . g . , [ 64 ] ) . The VPP also needs a precise adjustment of the defocus , which can be a problem for the collection of a tilt series due to the defocus gradient along the tilted sample . Automated data collection is implemented in commercial data collection suites from EM and camera manufacturers ( ThermoFisher , GATAN , TVIPS ) . Alternatively , there is an abundance of free software packages like SerialEM [ 65 ] , TOM [ 66 ] , UCSF Tomography [ 67 ] and Leginon [ 68 ] . This list is not exhaustive and does not include scripts or modiﬁcations to the software to implement features like the ones above ( e . g . , [ 34 , 59 ] ) . 3 . Data Processing 3 . 1 . Tomogram Generation After pre - processing each individual image of a tilt series needs to be precisely aligned . Colloidal gold particles ( ﬁducial markers ) are usually added to the sample before freezing . In specimens that contain no ﬁducial markers , like FIB milled lamella , patch - tracking can be used for the alignment [ 69 , 70 ] . The reduced alignment precision in patch - tracking leads to a lower resolution of the tomograms , but there are methods to add ﬁducial markers to the cells ( e . g . , [ 71 ] ) or lamellas after FIB milling [ 72 ] . The alignment is a crucial step and is done iteratively . If segmented volumes of the tomogram ( sub - tomograms ) are processed , it is possible to use these volumes as ﬁducial markers to correct for local deformations [ 35 , 73 ] . The phase contrast generated by the microscope introduces artefacts in images . Therefore tomograms must be corrected after estimating the CTF by programs like CTFFIND4 [ 61 ] or CTFPLOTTER [ 74 ] . The CTF is not uniform over the whole image at any given tilt , because the defocus value changes away from the tilt axis ( with the exception of the 0 ◦ image ) . The image can be CTF corrected in 2D by dividing it into tiles or stripes and calculating the defocus gradient [ 74 – 76 ] . For CTF correction of high - resolution structures , the position of the sub - tomogram within the tomogram must be considered [ 77 ] . Individual sub - tomogram CTF correction is possible as well [ 35 , 73 ] . Once the tilt series is aligned and all other parameters are determined ( shifts , precise tilt angles , offsets ) the tomogram can be reconstructed from the tilt series . The most common approach is weighted back - projection , which preserves high - resolution data [ 20 , 78 ] . Although other more recent methods exist , some of which compensate for the missing wedge , their usefulness for high - resolution work needs to be tested [ 79 – 81 ] . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6177 9 of 14 3 . 2 . Sub - Tomogram Averaging The greatest strength of cryoET is the instant generation of 3D structures . If repetitive structures or multiple copies of a complex are present , sub - volumes ( or sub - tomograms ) of the particles can be averaged and classiﬁed ( see Figure 5 for a general workﬂow ) . Sub - tomogram averaging ( STA ) is a popular technique , accounting for 8 % of the maps in the EMDB . This is more than the maps solved by helical reconstruction and electron crys - tallography combined . A sub - tomogram averaging project starts with the identiﬁcation and extraction of sub - tomograms ( STs ) . The STs are found by template matching of a known structure or by generating a template from manually picked sub - tomograms [ 52 , 82 ] . Alternatively , a grid can be constructed , and sub - tomograms are extracted in deﬁned increments . The latter is used on ﬁlaments and assemblies on membranes ( e . g . , [ 32 , 33 ] ) . Machine learning algorithms like tensor voting can help with automatic segmentation [ 83 ] . Convoluted neuronal networks can also be trained to detect sub - tomograms without prior structural information [ 84 ] . The STs are then aligned with respect to one or multiple refer - ences . The alignment of the ST is performed on the basis of a similarity cross - correlation . One has to be aware that the ( sub ) tomograms miss data due to stage limitations , which are visible as a wedge in Fourier space ( missing wedge ) . As a result , the structure is distorted and stretched along the missing wedge . This inﬂuences the cross - correlation , which is sensitive to features caused by the missing wedge . One way to mitigate this is the applica - tion of a similar wedge - shaped binary mask in Fourier space , aligned to the missing data , on the reference . The cross - correlation will then only compare sample features ( constrained cross - correlation [ 85 ] ) . After aligning , similar sub - tomograms can be averaged , and the alignment can be repeated with a new average . To avoid overﬁtting , the average should be low - pass ﬁltered before entering the next round . The ﬁlter is based on the Fourier shell res - olution of two independent datasets . If there are different structures in the sub - tomogram pool ( conformers , different complex stoichiometry , etc . ) , the sub - tomograms should be classiﬁed . The most straightforward classiﬁcation is based on the cross - correlation values from the alignment step . Cross - correlation - based classiﬁcation requires a template . Clas - siﬁcation based on principle component analysis / k means clustering ( PCA ) avoids this potential bias , although PCA is sensitive to the missing wedge as well . Again , the missing wedge can either be masked with a binary mask [ 85 , 86 ] or a 3D sample function that is based on the resolution - weighted CTF [ 73 ] . Lastly , the classiﬁcation ( and alignment ) can be done with a maximum likelihood approach , in which CTF - corrected sub - tomograms are used [ 87 ] . Although the tomogram reconstruction , alignment and classiﬁcation are described as sequential ( Figure 5 ) , many programs and workﬂows process some or all steps together . The power of STA has been recently demonstrated by generating < 4 Å structures for in situ complexes [ 35 ] and 2 – 4 Å structures for ex vivo / in vitro complexes , rivalling SPA structure generation [ 34 , 35 , 73 ] . For an exhaustive discussion of the workﬂow and theory , see [ 88 , 89 ] . Programs for STA are Dynamo [ 86 ] , EMAN2 , emClarity [ 73 ] , M [ 35 ] , PEET [ 90 ] , i3 [ 82 ] , Pytom [ 91 ] and Relion [ 87 ] . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6177 10 of 14 Int . J . Mol .

General workflow for the processing of tomograms and sub - tomogram averaging . First , the movies are motion - corrected , and the resulting images are aligned . The aligned tilt series is then used to calculate the tomogram . CTF correction can happen during these steps . The individual sub - tomograms are then identified and extracted . The sub - tomograms are then aligned against references and averaged . At this stage , missing wedge compensation is applied . Aligned sub - tomograms ( or averaged sub - tomograms ) are then classified . Processing is iterative ( black ar - rows ) . Averaged sub - tomograms help to refine steps earlier in the workflow . It should be pointed out that this is a general workflow . Depending on the software , some steps are merged . 4 . Outlook The advances in cryoET over the last five years have been breathtaking . Structures generated by in vitro samples have improved to the point that they are comparable in resolution to SPA structures . Although it is the exception rather than the rule , in situ structures can have a resolution that allows de novo model - building with atomic resolu - tion . One of the biggest challenges in cryoET is throughput . The collection of tomograms is still limited by mechanical constraints of the microscope , resulting in dedicated to - mography microscopes . Unlike in STA , data collection for SPA allows the collection of high - resolution data on 100 – 200 kV microscopes [ 92 ] . The production of lamella is still slow and requires an experienced user [ 93 ] . Automation of this process will make this technique more accessible to a broader user base [ 94 , 95 ] . The low SNR is still a problem in the data collection . Phase plates improve the contrast greatly , but the VPP comes with serious drawbacks . Recently , a report showed that a standing light wave can be used to shift the phase of the electron beam [ 96 ] , which avoids the problems of the VPP . Even if improvements in imaging instrumentation and FIB milling take place , the protein abundance ( or scarcity ) will limit what complexes can be imaged in situ . Instead , in situ is suited for the observation of the formation of complexes in response to stimuli . Figure 5 . General workﬂow for the processing of tomograms and sub - tomogram averaging .

High - resolution in situ cryoET could establish a molecular etiology of diseases , like amy - loid diseases [ 52 ] or mitochondria diseases [ 97 ] . The same is true for in vitro cryoET , where it could be shown that amyloid oligomers and protoﬁlaments , but not ﬁbrils , intercalate into one leaﬂet of the bilayer [ 98 ] .

The latter will be accessible for cryoET with lamellae that can be lifted out of tissues [ 101 ] . Author Contributions : Z . W . edited and corrected the manuscript . Q .
