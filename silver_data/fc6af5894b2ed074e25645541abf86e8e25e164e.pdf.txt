Volume 28 July 7 , 2017 1853 Direct measurement of the strength of microtubule attachment to yeast centrosomes ABSTRACT Centrosomes , or spindle pole bodies ( SPBs ) in yeast , are vital mechanical hubs that maintain load - bearing attachments to microtubules during mitotic spindle assembly , spindle positioning , and chromosome segregation . However , the strength of microtubule - centrosome attachments is unknown , and the possibility that mechanical force might regulate centrosome function has scarcely been explored . To uncover how centrosomes sustain and regulate force , we purified SPBs from budding yeast and used laser trapping to manipulate single attached microtubules in vitro . Our experiments reveal that SPB – microtubule attach - ments are extraordinarily strong , rupturing at forces approximately fourfold higher than ki - netochore attachments under identical loading conditions . Furthermore , removal of the calmodulin - binding site from the SPB component Spc110 weakens SPB – microtubule attach - ment in vitro and sensitizes cells to increased SPB stress in vivo . These observations show that calmodulin binding contributes to SPB mechanical integrity and suggest that its removal may cause pole delamination and mitotic failure when spindle forces are elevated . We propose that the very high strength of SPB – microtubule attachments may be important for spindle integrity in mitotic cells so that tensile forces generated at kinetochores do not cause micro - tubule detachment and delamination at SPBs . INTRODUCTION The centrosome is the microtubule - organizing center of the cell , responsible for nucleation of microtubules and organization of the bipolar mitotic spindle . Centrosomes serve as mechanical hubs , subjected to force from interpolar microtubules ( Dumont and Mitchison , 2009 ; Goshima and Scholey , 2010 ; van Heesbeen et al . , 2014 ; Shimamoto et al . , 2015 ) , kinetochore microtubules ( Liu and Lampson , 2009 ; Umbreit and Davis , 2012 ; Chacón et al . , 2014 ) , and astral microtubules ( Morris , 2000 ; Laan et al . , 2012 ; Nicholas et al . , 2015 ) . Mechanoregulation has been implicated in many cellular processes , including the tension - dependent stabilization of kineto - chore – microtubule attachments during mitosis ( Nicklas and Koch , 1969 ; Dewar et al . , 2004 ; Cane et al . , 2013 ; reviewed in Sarangapani and Asbury , 2014 ) . However , the mechanical strength of centro - some – microtubule attachments is unknown , and the role of me - chanical signals at centrosomes remains unclear . The mammalian centrosome consists of a pair of centrioles sur - rounded by a matrix of proteins . This matrix , called the pericentrio - lar material , serves as a scaffold and anchors microtubule - nucleating proteins . The pericentriolar material exhibits fluid - like properties , with turnover and growth dynamics that have not yet been fully characterized ( Woodruff et al . , 2014 , 2015 ) . The complexity and dy - namics of pericentriolar material make it difficult to understand how forces are transmitted through the mammalian centrosome struc - ture . In contrast , the yeast centrosome , or spindle pole body ( SPB ) , has been well characterized as a highly organized trilaminar struc - ture embedded in the nuclear membrane ( Moens and Rapport , 1971 ; Byers and Goetsch , 1975 ; O’Toole et al . , 1999 ; reviewed in Jaspersen and Winey , 2004 ; Kilmartin , 2014 ) .

Both yeast tethering proteins , Spc110 and Spc72 , are essential , and both share homology with the mammalian proteins of similar function , pericentrin ( kendrin ) and CDK5RAP2 ( centrosomin ; Flory et al . , 2000 ; Flory and Davis , 2003 ; Lin et al . , 2014 , 2015 ) . Spc110 is also likely to enhance the microtubule - nucleation activity of the γ - tubulin small complex ( Kollman et al . , 2010 ; Lin et al . , 2014 ; Lyon et al . , 2016 ) . Because the molecular organization of the budding yeast SPB is understood more completely than that of other centrosomes , yeast SPBs are ideal for initial characterization of centrosome – microtubule attachment strengths . Their or - ganization suggests clear hypotheses about which molecules bear load and transmit force through the organelle . We used our understanding of SPB structure and the ge - netic tractability of yeast to explore these hypotheses and report the first measure - ments of centrosome – microtubule attach - ment strengths . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Reconstitution of SPB – microtubule attachments The SPBs used in our experiments were iso - lated by affinity purification using a C - termi - nal tandem affinity purification ( TAP ) tag on Spc97 of the γ - tubulin small complex ( Fong et al . , 2016 ) . These SPBs also contained Spc42 C - terminally tagged with mCherry for visualization in fluorescence experi - ments . Yeast strains carrying both tagged components in place of the untagged ver - sions grew at normal rates , indicating that the tagged versions are functional . The presence of Spc110 and Spc97 in the iso - lated SPBs was verified by Western blot analysis ( Supplemental Figure S1A ) . The presence of all SPB components was veri - fied by mass spectrometry ( Supplemental Table S1 ) . The SPBs were adhered sparsely to KOH - cleaned glass coverslips , and free bovine tubulin was introduced to nucleate microtubules from the SPBs . The nucleated microtubules were stabilized with Taxol , and then polystyrene microbeads , coated with conventional kinesin ( a Kinesin - 1 con - struct from Drosophila ; see Materials and Methods ) , were allowed to bind the Taxol - stabilized microtubules ( Figure 1 , B – D ) . In the absence of ATP , the kinesin - coated beads formed strong , static attachments to the microtubules and served as handles through which to apply force to the microtu - bule – SPB interface ( as described in the next section ) . We primarily used video - enhanced differential interference contrast ( VE - DIC ) imaging to identify the individual SPBs , which were distinctly visible as puncta on the coverslip surface , and to view the nucle - ated microtubules and the beads ( Figure 1 , While yeast SPBs are morphologically distinct from mammalian centrosomes , the microtubule - organizing and nucleation functions , as well as the essential protein components , are highly conserved across organisms ( Stearns et al . , 1991 ; Gillingham and Munro , 2000 ; Wang et al . , 2010 ) . The γ - tubulin small complex is essential for mi - crotubule nucleation and caps microtubule minus ends in all organ - isms ( Byers et al . , 1978 ; Keating and Borisy , 2000 ; Moritz et al . , 2000 ; Wiese and Zheng , 2000 ; Kollman et al . , 2015 ) . In yeast , the γ - tubulin small complex is tethered to the core of the SPB via inter - actions with Spc110 on the nuclear face and Spc72 on the cytoplas - mic face ( Figure 1A ; Knop and Schiebel , 1997 , 1998 ; Sundberg and FIGURE 1 : Reconstitution of SPB – microtubule attachments . ( A ) Arrangement of components within the SPB . Top , microtubule minus ends attach γ - tubulin small complexes ( γ - TuSCs ) on the nuclear and cytoplasmic faces of the SPB .

Volume 28 July 7 , 2017 Strength of MT attachment to centrosomes | 1855 probably also important for establishing a bipolar spindle from a monopolar initial condition because pivoting of microtubules ema - nating from side - by - side poles is probably required to form antipar - allel cross - links ( O’Toole et al . , 1999 ; Blackwell et al . , 2017 ) . In our in vitro assay , the SPB - nucleated microtubules pivoted about their point of attachment to the SPB , fluctuating around a stable mean orientation ( Figure 1 , E and F , and Supplemental Figure S2 ) . This behavior shows that their orientation was somewhat constrained yet flexible enough for thermal energy to drive deflections , consistent with the flexible tethering seen in vivo ( O’Toole et al . , 1999 ; Kalinina et al . , 2013 ) . Development of a laser trap assay to measure SPB – microtubule attachment strength Once we verified that our in vitro experimental setup reconstituted biologically relevant SPB – microtubule attachments , we sought to measure their strength using a laser trap . We first selected an SPB that had nucleated a single microtubule to which a kinesin - coated bead had attached . Then the laser trap was controlled by a com - puter to apply precise tensile forces to the bead , directed away from the SPB ( Figure 2 , A and B ) . We operated the trap in a force - ramp mode , in which the force is initially held constant ( preload regime ; Figure 2C ) and then automatically increased at a constant rate ( 5 pN / s ) in an attempt to rupture the SPB – microtubule interface ( ramp regime ; Figure 2C ) . In prior work , we used similar force - ramp protocols to measure the rupture strengths of attachments between recombinant ki - netochore complexes and microtubule tips ( Franck et al . , 2010 ; Tien et al . , 2010 ) and also between native yeast kinetochore par - ticles and dynamic microtubule tips ( Akiyo - shi et al . , 2010 ; Sarangapani et al . , 2014 ) . However , we found that the strength of mi - crotubule attachments to SPBs was much stronger than to kinetochores . Their very high strength posed additional technical challenges for measuring their rupture strength . The tension imposed by the laser trap in our SPB assay is transmitted through the bead – microtubule interface , through the microtubule itself , through the SPB , and into the glass coverslip . To rupture the SPB – microtubule interface , all of the other mole - cular interfaces along the path of force transmission must remain intact . Fortu - nately , the SPBs adhered very strongly to and never released from the coverslip . However , the bead – microtubule interface was not always strong enough to remain in - tact during the force ramp . Consequently a fraction of trials ended in failure at the bead – microtubule interface rather than at the SPB – microtubule interface . A second challenge was that SPB strengths often exceeded the load limit of our instrument ( ∼ 65 pN ) , such that a fraction of trials ended without any rupture . Both alternative out - comes imposed a downward bias on our measurements of SPB – microtubule rupture forces , tending to shift the distributions of rupture force toward lower values . E and H ) . To confirm that the puncta observed by DIC imaging were indeed SPBs , we identified putative SPBs that had nucleated micro - tubules by DIC and then examined the same fields of view by total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . More than 99 % of the microtubule - nucleating puncta identified by DIC also exhibited Spc42 - mCherry fluorescence ( 149 of 150 puncta examined ) . Fluo - rescently labeled microtubules emanated end - on from the SPB puncta ( Figure 1G ) . In vivo , microtubules are anchored to centrosomes by their mi - nus ends , while their plus ends extend outward , toward the chromo - somes and the cell cortex . To determine whether this polarity was preserved in our in vitro assay , we added ATP to the buffer to acti - vate the plus end – directed walking motility of the kinesin - coated beads on SPB - attached microtubules . After addition of ATP , we allowed the kinesin beads to walk freely along the microtubule , in the absence of externally applied tension ( Figure 1H ) . In 97 % of the cases , the beads moved away from the SPBs , toward the free ( plus ) ends ( 94 of 97 beads tested ) . Thus the microtubules were attached to the SPBs by their minus ends , as in the physiological situation . In vivo , microtubules emanate from SPBs at a variety of angles , indicating that their minus ends are tethered through flexible links ( Winey et al . , 1995 ) . This flexibility is biologically important , particu - larly during early mitosis , when pivoting of SPB - associated microtu - bules allows them to be efficiently captured by kinetochores ( Kalinina et al . , 2013 ) . Flexibility of the SPB - – microtubule interface is FIGURE 2 : Measuring the strength of individual SPB – microtubule attachments . ( A ) Beads decorated with kinesins ( in the absence of ATP , i . e . , in “rigor” ) form strong linkages to the microtubules , allowing application of high forces to individual SPB – microtubule attachments using a laser trap . ( B ) The laser trap ( not visible ) applies force to a bead linked to an SPB - attached microtubule ( MT ) . Top , initially , the trap pushes the bead toward the SPB , applying compressive force to the SPB - MT interface and causing the MT to buckle . Middle , the direction of force is reversed to apply tensile force to the SPB - MT attachment . Bottom , after the SPB - MT interface ruptures ( arrows ) , the filament remains linked to and pivots around the trapped bead . The SPB appears slightly different in this image due to a slight change in microscope focus . See also Supplemental Movie S2 .

Thus we ablated the cytoplasmic face by depleting Spc72 with an auxin - inducible de - gron ( Spc72 - AID ) before SPB purification ( Nishimura et al . , 2009 ) . More than 98 % of auxin - treated cells were multibudded and con - tained multiple SPBs ( Supplemental Figure S1B ) , as expected for cells lacking Spc72 , which have a multinuclear phenotype arising from failure to move the daughter nucleus into the bud ( Chen et al . , 1998 ; Souès and Adams , 1998 ) . This observation confirms that Spc72 was efficiently degraded . When microtubule attachment strengths to Spc72 - depleted SPBs were measured by our laser trap assay , neither the estimated force at 75 % survival , 50 . 3 pN ( 95 % confidence interval , 41 . 0 – 60 . 0 pN ) nor the estimated Kaplan – Meier survival curve differed significantly from wild type ( Figure 3 , A and B ; Table 1 summarizes all measurement statistics and reports p values from log - rank tests ; Bland and Altman , 2004 ) . These observations are consistent with our hypothesis that cytoplasmic microtubules made little or no con - tribution . Formally , they are also consistent with an alternative sce - nario in which our experiments measured both cytoplasmic and nuclear attachments and both attachment types are of identical strength . Such a scenario , however , seems unlikely , given the sys - tematic weakening caused by a mutation on the nuclear side , de - scribed later . Calmodulin is required for strong SPB – microtubule attachments In vivo , Spc110 tethers microtubule minus ends to the nuclear face of the SPB , spanning the distance from the γ - tubulin small complex to the SPB core ( specifically , to the “central plaque” ; Kilmartin et al . , 1993 ) . Spc110 binds the SPB core via a C - terminal domain that also contains a calmodulin - binding site ( Geiser et al . , 1993 ; Stirling et al . , 1994 ) . Immuno – electron microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis confirm that calmodulin resides within the SPB core , very close to the C - terminus of Spc110 and also near other core proteins ( e . g . , Spc29 and Spc42 ; Sundberg et al . , 1996 ; Muller et al . , 2005 ) . Temperature - sensitive mutations in either calmodulin or in the calmodulin - binding site of Spc110 cause misas - sembly of Spc110 away from the SPB ( Sundberg et al . , 1996 ) . The function of calmodulin in the SPB is unknown , but given its localiza - tion at the core and the phenotype of the temperature - sensitive mu - tants , we hypothesized that calmodulin might contribute to the me - chanical integrity of the SPB . To test this idea directly , we took advantage of a suppressor mutant allele of SPC110 that overcomes the requirement for calmodulin at the SPB . The allele , SPC110 - 407 , In experiments with wild - type SPBs , rupture occurred at the SPB – microtubule interface in 41 % of trials ( 156 of 376 trials ) . The raw mean rupture force , computed from only the subset of trials ending with SPB – microtubule rupture , was 45 . 0 ± 1 . 4 pN ( mean ± SEM ; N = 156 ; Figure 2D ) . Failure at the bead – microtubule inter - face accounted for 15 % of the trials ( 56 of 376 ) and occurred on average at 36 . 9 ± 1 . 8 pN ( raw mean ± SEM ; N = 56 ) . In the remain - ing 44 % of trials ( 164 of 376 ) , the trap load - limit was reached at 65 . 2 ± 0 . 7 pN ( raw mean ± SEM ; N = 164 ) , without any rupture or failure . These trials during which the SPB – microtubule interface outlived the bead – microtubule interface or when it survived up to the load limit are analogous to the common situation in clinical tri - als when a patient drops out of the study before the outcome of interest has occurred ( e . g . , before death ) . Clinical data from such patients are “censored” when they are lost from the study , but their survival up to the time of dropout nevertheless provides useful in - formation about the efficacy of the treatment . Similarly , in our ex - periments , failures at the bead – microtubule interface and trials in which the load limit was reached provide censored data indicating that an SPB – microtubule attachment survived up to the point of censoring . Thus we used all of the data , including censored data , to estimate the true ( unbiased ) survival probability as a function of force by applying Kaplan – Meier analysis ( Kaplan and Meier , 1958 ) , a statistical method used routinely in clinical trials ( Rich et al . , 2010 ) . This method estimates survival from the number of SPB – microtu - bule ruptures at each level of force , normalized by the number still “at risk” of rupturing at that force ( including those that are later censored ; see Materials and Methods ) . Based on this analysis , esti - mated force at 75 % survival for wild - type SPB attachments was 47 . 3 pN ( 95 % confidence interval , 42 . 2 – 52 . 5 pN ; Figure 2E and Table 1 ) . Removal of the cytoplasmic face does not affect the measured strengths During closed mitosis in yeast , the SPB nucleates microtubules from both its nuclear and cytoplasmic faces ( Jaspersen and Winey , 2004 ; Kilmartin , 2014 ) . The nuclear face nucleates ∼ 20 microtubules , whereas the cytoplasmic face nucleates only two or three ( Winey and O’Toole , 2001 ) . Because there are many more nuclear microtu - bules in vivo , we expected that most of our in vitro SPB - nucleated microtubules probably emanated from the nuclear face . To differen - tiate between nuclear and cytoplasmic attachments , we purified SPBs lacking the cytoplasmic face . In yeast , Spc72 links the γ - tubulin small complex to the cytoplasmic face ( Knop and Schiebel , 1998 ; Attachment type Estimated force at 75 % survival a ( pN ) Confidence interval , lower bound a ( pN ) Confidence interval , upper bound a ( pN ) Number of rupture events b Number of events censored by failure at bead Number of events censored by load limit p value compared with wild - type SPBs ( log - rank test ) Wild - type SPBs 47 . 3 42 . 2 52 . 5 156 56 164 — Spc72 - AID SPBs 50 . 3 41 . 0 60 . 0 42 47 51 0 . 95 Spc110 - 407 SPBs 32 . 0 24 . 5 46 . 1 47 78 31 0 . 041 Kinetochores 11 . 6 8 . 7 15 . 5 30 0 0 < 0 . 0001 a Forces at 75 % survival and their 95 % confidence intervals were estimated by Kaplan – Meier analysis . b All individual force values for ruptures at the SPB – microtubule interface , failures at the bead – microtubule interface , and events that reached the load limit of the trap are given in Supplemental Data File 1 . TABLE 1 : Summary of rupture strengths for microtubule attachments to wild - type and mutant SPBs and to kinetochores . Volume 28 July 7 , 2017 Strength of MT attachment to centrosomes | 1857 1969 ) . In contrast , microtubule minus ends are stably anchored and nondynamic at yeast SPBs ( Mallavarapu et al . , 1999 ; Mad - dox et al . , 2000 ; Khodjakov et al . , 2004 ) . Their dissociation from the nuclear face cor - relates with delamination of the SPB , spindle collapse , and irreversible cell cycle arrest ( Yoder et al . , 2005 ) . Thus it might be crucial that SPBs can normally sustain all tensile forces exerted on them by kinetochores via microtubules , such that SPBs always win the tug - of - war ( Figure 4A ) . Indeed , the strengths we measured for minus - end attachments to SPBs were higher than those measured pre - viously for attachments between kineto - chores and growing plus ends ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2010 ; Sarangapani et al . , 2014 ) . How - ever , this difference is probably exaggerated by the 20 - fold higher loading rate used in our SPB assays ( 5 vs . 0 . 25 pN / s for kineto - chores ) , given that faster loading rates are well known to increase rupture forces for in - termolecular bonds ( Merkel et al . , 1999 ) . We therefore remeasured rupture strengths for kinetochore attachments to microtubule plus ends at the same loading rate we used for SPBs . Under identical loading rates , the kinetochore attachments remained far weaker than SPB attachments . Their esti - mated force at 75 % survival , 11 . 6 pN ( 95 % confidence interval , 8 . 7 – 15 . 5 pN ) , was four - fold lower than the corresponding value for wild - type SPBs , and their estimated Kaplan – Meier survival curve was very significantly lower as well ( Figure 3 , A and C , and Table 1 ) . The much higher strength of SPB – versus kinetochore – microtubule attachments may be explained by structural and kinetic differ - ences between these two types of interfaces . All of the terminal α - tubulins at an SPB - attached microtubule minus end are stably bound by γ - tubulins , which associate in pairs with two accessory proteins , Spc97 and Spc98 ( GCP2 and GCP3 ) , to form γ - tubulin small complexes ( Knop and Schiebel , 1997 ; Oegema et al . , 1999 ; Kollman et al . , 2015 ) . The γ - tubulin small complexes , in turn , are stably tethered into the SPB core by dimers of Spc110 ( or its equiva - lent , Spc72 , on the cytoplasmic face ; Knop and Schiebel , 1997 , 1998 ; Sundberg and Davis , 1997 ; Nguyen et al . , 1998 ; Souès and Adams , 1998 ) . Thus tensile loads on the SPB are probably distrib - uted across at least 13 high - affinity protein – protein bonds . Yeast ki - netochores carry a similarly large number of microtubule - binding elements , including 8 – 20 Ndc80 complexes and 16 to ∼ 40 Dam1 complexes ( Joglekar et al . , 2006 ; Lawrimore et al . , 2011 ) . However , the microtubule binders of the kinetochore must dynamically bind and unbind or slide along the filament to maintain attachment dur - ing tip assembly and disassembly . Tensile load on the kinetochore might therefore be shared by only a subset of elements that happen to be tightly bound at any given moment . Removal of calmodulin from SPBs sensitizes cells to increased SPB stress Although removal of the calmodulin - binding site from Spc110 weakened the in vitro SPB – microtubule attachments compared with encodes a C - terminal truncation that removes the calmodulin - binding site and fails to localize calmodulin to the SPB in vivo ( Geiser et al . , 1993 ) . We purified calmodulin - depleted SPBs from cells carrying SPC110 - 407 in place of the wild - type gene and tested them in our rupture strength assay . The Spc110 - 407 poles attached more weakly to microtubules than wild - type SPBs . Their estimated force at 75 % survival , 32 . 0 pN ( 95 % confidence interval , 24 . 5 – 46 . 1 pN ) , and their estimated Kaplan – Meier survival curve were significantly lower than those for wild - type poles ( Figure 3 , A and C , and Table 1 ) . These results show that calmodulin and the C - terminal calmodulin - binding domain of Spc110 contribute to the strength of SPB – microtubule attachments . Wild - type SPBs withstand forces much higher than kinetochores In the context of the mitotic spindle , a tug - of - war can occur between kinetochores and spindle poles . Tension applied by the kinetochores to microtubule plus ends ( Chacón et al . , 2014 ) is transmitted to their minus ends tethered at the poles . The kinetochore - attached plus ends are dynamic , continuously assembling or disassembling , and eukaryotic cells possess efficient mechanisms for rapidly correcting and reestablishing these dynamic attachments , making ruptures at the kinetochore – microtubule interface repairable ( Nicklas and Koch , FIGURE 3 : Removal of calmodulin from the nuclear - side tether weakens SPB – microtubule attachments .

K . Fong et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell and delamination at SPBs . Quantitative comparison between wild - type and mutant SPBs indicates that microtubule attach - ment strength depends on the tethering molecule , Spc110 , and calmodulin . The dependence of attachment strength on calmodulin implies that this molecule helps reinforce the anchorage of Spc110 into the SPB core and predicts that , under condi - tions of high SPB stress , loss of calmodulin sensitizes cells to SPB delamination . Given the homology that Spc110 shares with peri - centrin ( kendrin ) , which also binds calmodu - lin , we speculate that these mammalian proteins might also contribute mechanical strength to minus - end attachments at mam - malian centrosomes . We anticipate that our in vitro mechanical approach to studying SPB – microtubule attachments will allow fur - ther dissection of the molecular basis for their very high strength . Our work should also guide efforts to study the centrosomes of other eukaryotes and facilitate direct tests for whether forces control phosphoregula - tion or other signaling events at SPBs . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains , plasmids , and media All of the strains used in this study were de - rived from W303 . In BGY72 – 8A ( Fong et al . , 2016 ) , ( MAT a ) , Spc97 was C - terminally TAP - tagged by PCR amplification of the TAP - kanMX cassette from the plasmid TAP - 2xPA using primers that shared homology with the flanking sequences of the SPC97 stop codon . Spc42 was C - terminally tagged with mCherry by PCR ampli - fication of the mCherry - hphMX3 cassette from pBS35 ( a gift from the Yeast Resource Center , University of Washington , Seattle , WA ) with homology flanking the SPC42 stop codon . For the Spc72 - AID strain , the auxin degron IAA7 was PCR am - plified from pSB2065 ( a gift from Sue Biggins , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle , WA ) with primers that shared homology with the flanking sequences of the SPC72 stop codon . The diploid was sporulated and dissected , and haploids were se - lected for pADH1 - OsTIR1 - 9myc : : URA3 , SPC42 - mCherry : : hphMX , SPC72 - AID : : kanMX , and SPC97 - TAP : : kanMX , resulting in strain KFY329 - 24B . BGY72 - 8A was crossed with a haploid containing SPC110 - 407 . The diploids were sporulated and dissected , and haploids were selected for SPC42 - mCherry : : hphMX and SPC97 - TAP : : kanMX . The presence of Spc110 – 407 was determined by TCA precipitation and Western blot analysis , resulting in strain KFY304 - 2D . A strain expressing SPC110 - 407 was crossed to a strain express - ing DAM1 - 765 . Two - thirds of the SPC110 - 407 DAM1 - 765 spores were dead , and the remaining one - third showed slowed growth , indicating synthetic lethality between SPC110 - 407 and DAM1 - 765 . Yeast extract peptone dextrose ( YPD ) medium is as described in Burke et al . ( 2000 ) . Growth of yeast strains Wild type and SPC110 - 407 yeast strains were grown in YPD and harvested at 150 Klett units . Spc72 - AID cells were grown to 100 Klett units . Auxin ( indole - 3 - acetic acid ) in dimethyl sulfoxide was wild - type SPBs , the calmodulin - free Spc110 - 407 poles were still stronger than kinetochores ( Figure 3C and Table 1 ) . In vivo , these mutant poles support normal cell growth rates ( Geiser et al . , 1993 ) , so we expected that their strength in vitro would exceed that of ki - netochores . We hypothesized , however , that under conditions of increased SPB stress , the reduced strength of Spc110 - 407 SPBs might no longer suffice , and cell growth might be compromised . To test this idea , we crossed SPC110 - 407 cells with cells carrying a mu - tant kinetochore allele , DAM1 - 765 , that was previously shown to increase mechanical stresses on SPBs ( Shimogawa et al . , 2006 ) . Cells carrying DAM1 - 765 alone are viable , but we found that the allele is lethal when combined with SPC110 - 407 ( Figure 4B ) . DAM1 - 765 is also synthetic lethal in combination with another SPC110 mu - tant allele , spc110 - 226 ( Shimogawa et al . , 2006 ) , which sensitizes cells to delamination of their SPBs at high growth temperatures ( Yoder et al . , 2005 ) . The finding that SPC110 - 407 , like spc110 - 226 , is synthetic lethal in combination with DAM1 - 765 suggests that SPC110 - 407 similarly compromises SPB strength in vivo , consistent with the weakening it caused in our in vitro experiments . Conclusion In summary , our new in vitro assay has allowed a direct assessment of the strength of attachment between microtubule minus ends and yeast SPBs , which are functionally equivalent to the centrosomes of other eukaryotes . The strength of SPB – microtubule attachment is very high , exceeding the strength of attachment between kineto - chores and growing microtubule plus ends by approximately fourfold . We suggest that this strong anchorage to SPBs might be important for spindle integrity in mitotic cells so that tensile forces generated at kinetochores do not cause microtubule detachment FIGURE 4 : Removal of calmodulin from nuclear - side tether sensitizes cells to increased SPB stress . ( A ) Tug - of - war model , kinetochores vs . SPBs . Top left , after chromosome biorientation , tension generated at kinetochore - attached microtubule plus ends is transmitted to SPB - attached minus ends . Bottom left , strong minus - end anchorage normally prevents detachment at the SPB , such that ruptures , if they occur , happen at the kinetochore – microtubule interface , which is weaker but readily repairable . Bottom right , altering the relative strengths of SPB and kinetochore attachments ( e . g . , by combining SPC110 - 407 and DAM1 - 765 ) can lead to ruptures at minus ends , possibly causing SPB delamination , cell cycle arrest , and lethality . ( B ) Tetrad analysis confirms that the mutant SPB allele SPC110 - 407 is lethal when combined with a mutant kinetochore allele , DAM1 - 765 , which was previously shown to increase mechanical stresses on SPBs ( Shimogawa et al . , 2006 ) . Each column shows the four colonies derived from a single tetrad produced by mating a haploid SPC110 - 407 strain with a haploid DAM1 - 765 strain and then inducing meiosis ( sporulation ) . Boxed colonies , expressing both mutant alleles , exhibited slow or no growth . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 a b c d B A SPB microtubule chromosome kinetochore ruptureat SPB ( unrepairable ? ) rupture at kinetochore ( repairable ) tug - of - war Volume 28 July 7 , 2017 Strength of MT attachment to centrosomes | 1859 individual kinesin – microtubule bonds are weaker than streptavidin – biotin bonds at the single - molecule level ( Merkel et al . , 1999 ; Uemura and Ishiwata , 2003 ) , the streptavidin – biotin linkages proved to be weaker in our experiments , which used beads coated densely with the proteins . This observation suggests that at high density on the beads , many kinesin molecules shared the load effectively , whereas relatively fewer streptavidins could do so . We speculate that the more elongated and flexible structure of the kinesins al - lowed their microtubule - binding heads to project farther from the bead surface than streptavidin , thereby facilitating more interactions with the microtubule . Anti - tubulin antibodies also proved to be weaker , so we performed all of the laser trap assays reported here using kinesin - coated beads . An N - terminal derivative of the Drosophila melanogaster kinesin heavy chain , DmK401 , was prepared as previously described ( Asbury et al . , 2003 ) . DmK401 consisted of a homodimer of the N - terminal 401 amino acids of the kinesin heavy chain with a hexahis - tidine ( 6H ) tag on the C - terminus . DmK401 was expressed in BL21 Star ( DE3 ) cells ( Invitrogen ) . We grew 250 - ml cultures at 20°C for 2 h after 1 mM isopropyl - β - d - thiogalactoside induction . Rifampicin was added to a final concentration of 200 μM , and cultures were grown overnight at 20°C . Cells were pelleted and resuspended in an equivalent volume of lysis buffer ( 250 mM potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 6 , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 4 mM MgCl 2 , Complete protease inhibitors [ Roche ] ) , lysed with a French press , and clarified by ultracentrifugation at 50 , 000 rpm for 40 min at 4°C . The clarified lysate was mixed with an equivalent volume of glycerol and stored at − 20°C . Streptavidin - coated polystyrene beads ( 0 . 44 μm in diameter ; Spherotech ) were functionalized with biotinylated anti - His 5 antibod - ies ( Qiagen ) and stored with continuous rotation at 4°C in BRB80 ( 80 mM 1 , 4 - piperazinediethanesulfonic acid [ PIPES ] , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid [ EGTA ] , pH 6 . 9 ) supple - mented with 8 mg / ml bovine serum albumin [ BSA ] for up to 3 mo . Before each experiment , beads were decorated with kinesin by incu - bating 6 pM anti - His 5 beads with 20 μl of cleared lysate from the kine - sin expression cells for 1 h at 4°C diluted in assay buffer ( BRB80 ; con - centration as before , 5 mg / ml BSA , 11 . 5 μM Taxol , and 1 mM DTT ) . Chamber preparation for laser trap experiment Flow chambers ( ∼ 10 - μl volume ) were made using glass slides , dou - ble - stick tape , and KOH - cleaned coverslips . Briefly , two lengths of double - stick tape were placed across a microscope slide to create a channel . A KOH - cleaned coverslip was placed over the channel and sealed with pressure . It was then functionalized in the following manner . An aliquot of purified SPBs was diluted with 5 × BRB80 ( 400 mM PIPES , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 5 mM EGTA ) , 40 mg / ml BSA , and 2 . 67 M KCl to a final concentration of 1 × BRB80 , 8 mg / ml BSA and 500 mM KCl . The diluted SPBs were introduced into the flow cham - ber and allowed to nonspecifically adhere to the coverslip for 30 min . The SPBs were washed thoroughly by flowing in BRB80 . Bovine brain tubulin , purified as previously described ( Castoldi and Popov , 2003 ) , was cleared of aggregates by ultracentrifugation at 90 , 000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C in a TLA100 rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) . The tubulin polymerization buffer ( 1 × BRB80 , 1 mg / ml κ - casein , 5 mg / ml BSA , 2 μM Taxol , 1 mM GTP , 1 mM DTT , and 20 μM cleared tubulin ) was added to the flow cell , and microtubules were allowed to nucleate at room temperature for several minutes . Free tubulin was washed out of the chamber with wash buffer ( 1 × BRB80 , 1 mg / ml κ - casein , 5 mg / ml BSA , 11 . 5 μM Taxol , and 1 mM DTT ) . Kinesin - coated beads ( described earlier ) were then flowed in along with an oxygen - scavenging system ( 500 μg / ml glucose oxidase , 60 μg / ml then added to a final concentration of 1 mM . The cells were then grown for an additional 3 h with auxin , to deplete Spc72 , before harvesting . More than 98 % of these Spc72 - depleted cells were mul - tibudded with multipolar spindles , as determined by fluorescence microscopy ( Supplemental Figure S1B ) . Yeast cells were harvested and lysed as previously described ( Fong et al . , 2016 ) . Yeast cells were pelleted and washed with distilled H 2 O twice before resuspension in buffer ( 20 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid [ HEPES ] buffer , pH 7 . 4 , 1 . 2 % polyvinylpyrrolidone [ average molecular weight 40 , 000 ] , 1 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] , 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride [ PMSF ] , 4 μg / ml aprotinin , 4 μg / ml chymostatin , 4 μg / ml leupeptin , 4 μg / ml pepstatin , 10 mM sodium fluoride , 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 1 mM β - glycerophosphate ) . Cells were pelleted again , and the cell paste was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen . Cell pel - lets were lysed by cryogrinding in a PM100 ball mill grinder ( Retsch ) . TAP purification and velocity sedimentation Yeast SPBs were purified by a TAP - tag on Spc97 as previously de - scribed ( Fong et al . , 2016 ) . Lysed cells were resuspended in extrac - tion buffer ( 20 mM HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 100 μM GTP , 1 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , 4 μg / ml aprotinin , 4 μg / ml chymostatin , 4 μg / ml leupeptin , 4 μg / ml pep - statin , 10 mM sodium fluoride , 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 1 mM β - glycerophosphate , 5 % glycerol ) with 300 mM NaCl and homoge - nized . The lysate was cleared at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4°C . Dynabeads conjugated to rabbit immunoglobulin G ( according to manufacturer’s protocols ) were added to cleared lysate and incu - bated for 30 min at 4°C . The Dynabeads were washed three times with extraction buffer with 200 mM NaCl . To elute the spindle pole bodies , the Dynabeads were resuspended in TEV cleavage buffer ( 40 mM HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 4 , 200 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM GTP , 1 mM ATP , 1 mM EDTA , pH 8 , 1 mM DTT , 5 % glycerol ) and incubated with 1 μg of TEV for 2 h at 4°C . Sucrose gradients were generated by allowing five steps of sucrose solutions ( 200 μl each of 10 , 20 , 30 , and 40 % and 2 . 5 M sucrose in 10 mM Bis - Tris , pH 6 . 5 , 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 ) to equilibrate at 4°C for 2 h . The TEV eluate was then applied to the sucrose gradient and spun at 50 , 000 rpm for 5 h at 4°C in a TLS55 rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) . Fractions ( 90 μl ) were removed from the top of the gradi - ent with wide - bore tips . The presence of SPBs was determined by Western blot analysis , probing for Spc110 and Spc97 ( Supplemental Figure S1A ) . Laser trap instrument The laser trap was described previously ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2010 ; Franck et al . , 2010 ; Sarangapani et al . , 2014 ) . Position sensor response was mapped using the piezo stage to raster - scan a stuck bead through the beam , and trap stiffness was calibrated along the two principal axes using the drag force , equipartition , and power spectrum methods . Force feedback was implemented with custom LabView software . During rupture force measurements , bead - trap separation was sampled at 40 kHz , and stage position was updated at 50 Hz to maintain the desired tension ( force - clamp assay ) or ramp rate ( force - ramp assay ) . Bead and stage position data were decimated to 200 Hz before being stored to disk . Preparation of kinesin - coated beads To minimize the bias caused by failures at the bead – microtubule interface , we tested several bead – microtubule linkage strategies , including biotinylated tubulin with streptavidin - coated beads and beads coated with anti - tubulin antibodies . Surprisingly , even though 1860 | K . K . Fong et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell catalase , and 25 mM glucose ) . The edges of the flow chamber were sealed to prevent evaporation . All laser trap experiments were per - formed in a temperature - controlled room maintained at 23°C . For kinetochore rupture force experiments , mitotic kinetochore particles were isolated from budding yeast by affinity purifying Dsn1 – 6His – 3Flag protein as previously described ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2010 ) and linked to anti - His 5 antibody – functionalized polystyrene beads as previously described ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2010 ; Sarangapani et al . , 2013 , 2014 ) . Briefly , before each experiment , beads were decorated with kinetochore particles by incubating 6 pM anti - His 5 beads for 60 min at 4°C with purified kinetochore material , corresponding to Dsn1 - His - Flag concentrations of 6 nM . Finally , kinetochore particle – coated beads were introduced at an eightfold dilution from the incubation mix in a solution of growth buffer containing 1 . 5 mg / ml purified bo - vine brain tubulin and an oxygen - scavenging system as described . Rupture force assay Spindle pole body puncta were identified using the DIC imaging module ( part of the laser trap setup ) , and those that had single mi - crotubules emanating from them were specifically chosen for pull - ing experiments . Many of these microtubules had prebound beads ( i . e . , beads already associated with the SPB - attached microtubule ) , but if no bead was bound to the microtubule , free beads from solu - tion were trapped and allowed to bind to these microtubules . The beads were initially subjected to a preload force of ∼ 5 pN . After a brief preload period , the laser trap was programmed to ramp the force at a constant rate of 5 pN / s until the microtubule ruptured from the SPB , the bead broke away from the microtubule , or the load limit of the trap was reached . For kinetochore rupture force experiments , the laser trap was used to place individual free beads close to the ends of growing microtubules to allow binding . On binding , the attachments were preloaded with a constant force of ∼ 5 pN . After a brief preload pe - riod during which we verified that the beads were moving at a rate consistent with that of microtubule growth , the laser trap was pro - grammed to ramp the force at a constant rate ( 5 pN / s ) until the ki - netochore – microtubule attachment ruptured . Survival curve analysis The Kaplan – Meier survival curve was estimated at each force associ - ated with an SPB – microtubule rupture as s f D N ( ) 1 i i i f f i ∏ = −     = ≤ where ∏ denotes a product series , D i represents the number of SPB – microtubule attachments that ruptured at force f i , and N i repre - sents the number of attachments that remained “at risk” of ruptur - ing at force f i ( excluding those that were censored at lower forces ) . An important assumption of this analysis is that SPB – microtubule attachments censored at any particular force ( i . e . , those that fail at the bead – microtubule interface or reach the load limit ) had the same risk of rupture as uncensored attachments . To calculate the p values shown in Table 1 , the Kaplan – Meier survival curves were compared using the log - rank test ( Bland and Altman , 2004 ) , a standard method for determining the degree of statistical significance in clinical trials . We also computed the esti - mated force at 75 % survival for each SPB type . Statistical analysis was performed using the Stata data analysis package . All the indi - vidual force values for ruptures at the SPB – microtubule interface , failures at the bead – microtubule interface , and events that reached the load limit of the trap are reported in Supplemental Data File 1 .
