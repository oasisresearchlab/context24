Here , we show that a single cell image can be used to discriminate its migration behavior by analyzing a large number of cell migration data in vitro . We analyzed a large number of two - dimensional cell migration images over time and found that the cell shape variation space has only six dimensions , and migration behavior can be determined by the coordinates of a single cell image in this 6 - dimensional shape - space . We further show that this is possible because persistent cell migration is characterized by spatial - temporally coordinated protrusion and contraction , and a distribution signature in the shape - space . Our findings provide a quantitative underpinning for using cell morphology to differentiate cell dynamical behavior . Key words : single cell migration , cell shape , spatiotemporal persistence Significance Statement Cell biology and pathology have traditionally relied on cell shape to discern cell phenotypes and states . Can we deduce the dynamical behavior of a cell from its shape ? We found , based on analyzing 10 ! cell images of 2D migration , that a static cell shape can discriminate migration patterns : not through simple shape features , but through its coordinates in the low - dimensional shape space . Further analysis explains that the dynamical signatures of intracellular mechanochemical coupling for migration is reflected in the spatiotemporal coordination of cell shape . Introduction Cell shape has traditionally been an important feature that biologists and pathologists rely on to discern cell type , behavior , and state . The underlying assumption of this practice , however , Text 3 has not been systematically and quantitatively tested . Many factors , e . g . , the cytoskeleton , the membrane , and adhesion , interact to give rise to cell shape . The detailed molecular scale understanding of these factors is available , but a cellular scale understanding of shape formation is still lacking . In this study , we used cell migration as an example of a dynamical process to address the fundamental question : can a single , static image of cell shape discriminate the dynamical behavior ? The shape of a cell changes during migration : the front adheres to the substrate , protrudes outward , and the rear contracts ; the number and size of protrusions change as a function of cell state and environment . Most of the molecular details for each individual step and the interaction between protrusion and adhesion have been established ( 1 - 3 ) . For motile keratocytes , shape can be used to predict migration speed ( 4 ) . Cell migration essentially is the sum of all the coordinated changes in cell shape . Genetically identical cells in the same environment exhibit rapid , slow , or negligible locomotion . We analyzed this intrinsic phenotypic migration heterogeneity in mouse fibroblast ( NIH3T3 ) and human glioblastoma ( LN229 ) cells , both are highly motile cell lines . Mouse fibroblast cells have been extensively used as a model system for cell migration ( 5 , 6 ) , making it a good choice for further shape analysis and an ideal comparison with human glioblastoma cells , whose migration is the hallmark of aggressive brain tumor and whose shape and migration behavior has not been quantitatively studied . Results Heterogeneous cellular persistence and migration behavior Using confocal and epifluorescence live cell imaging , we observed the spontaneous movement of low - density , single NIH3T3 ( 𝑛 = 517 ) and LN229 ( 𝑛 = 510 ) cells plated on fibronectin - coated polyacrylamide gels in the absence of any symmetry - breaking gradients . Cell movements were recorded at a rate of 1 frame per minute for up to 10 hours , resulting in 373 , 796 single cell images in total . The outline of each cell was segmented ( Fig . 1 A and Supplementary Text 4 Information ) . Cell shape ( Fig . 1 B ) was represented using a circular map 𝛺 ( 𝜃 , 𝑡 ) , which is the distance from the centroid to the cell periphery in the direction θ and at the time t . θ = 0 was fixed in the positive direction of the horizontal axis . The dynamics captured include both cell shape deformation ( Fig . 1 B ) and the centroid movement . The efficiency of cell migration depends on two essential parameters : cell centroid speed variability and directional persistence ( 7 ) . We first need to define migrator and non - migrator . During migration , cells show large variability in simple shape measurements including cell area , aspect ratio , major and minor axes , across the populations of both LN229 and NIH3T3 cells ( Fig . S1 ) : none of them can distinguish migrator vs non - migrators . To separate cells into migrators and non - migrators , we use the directionality ratio ( DR ) , which is the ratio between the straight - line distance ( 𝑑 ! " # ) and path length ( 𝐷 " # $ ) of the trajectory between the starting position and the current position . 𝐷𝑅 ( 𝑛𝛥𝑡 ) = % ! " # & ! " # = ’ ( ) ! " # * ) $ " # ) % , ( - ! " # * - $ " # ) % . & % ∑ 01 ) ’ " # * ) ( ’ ) & ) " # 2 % , 1 - ’ " # * - ( ’ ) & ) " # 2 % 3 & % ! ’ + & , ( 1 ) where ( 𝑥 4 # $ , 𝑦 4 # $ ) is the cell centroid of the 𝑖 $ 5 frame ( 𝜃 , 𝑖𝛥𝑡 ) ( Fig . 1 D ) ; 𝛥𝑡 is 1 minute in all our data and analysis . DR is an intuitive and effective metric for quantifying directional bias of cell trajectories ( Fig . 1 E ) . The choice of threshold of DR is optimized based on the analysis of all our cell data ( Fig . S2 B ) . We found that the mean square displacement ( MSD ) of the cell trajectories follows a power law 𝑀𝑆𝐷 ( 𝑡 ) ~ 𝐷𝑡 67 , where D is the diffusion coefficient and the exponent α characterizes the nature of diffusive motion . However , for both NIH3T3 and LN229 cells , neither D nor 𝛼 8 value can serve as a quantitative concise descriptor of cell motility pattern ( Fig . 1 E and Fig . S2 ) , suggesting that diffusivity cannot easily discriminate migrators and non - migrators . It has been shown previously to describe the migration characteristics of fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells ( 8 ) . For both LN229 and NIH3T3 cells , we found that migrators have greater Text 5 persistent time P and smaller cell speed variation S , compared with non - migrators ( Fig . 1 F ) , which can be explained using the stochastic differential equation that non - migrators have greater magnitude of random fluctuations in speed or less coordination in membrane displacements ( Fig . 1 F - G and Supplementary Information ) . Low - dimensional variability of cell shape and cell migration behavior To determine how a cell changes its shape during migration , we analyzed the 2D cell shapes 𝛺 ( 𝜃 , 𝑡 ) and the membrane displacement 𝜇 ( 𝜃 , 𝑡 ) = % 8 ( 9 , $ ) % $ . The latter captures membrane deformation that varies in size , quantity , and location . The membrane displacements are fewer but larger in size and are more biased in direction for migrators ( Fig . 2 A ) than for non - migrators ( Fig . 2 B ) . The quantity , width and magnitude of directional membrane displacement reflects the intrinsic variability in the underlying molecular mechanisms that result in cell shape differences . To characterize the cell shape variability quantitatively , we applied principal components analysis ( 4 , 9 ) to the shapes of NIH3T3 and LN229 cells separately . We found that six orthogonal modes of shape variation ( Fig . 2 C and Fig . 2 D ) account for ~ 99 % of the total shape variability in both cell lines . These shape modes provide a low - dimensional ( 6 - dimensional ) space , where each mode is an axis of the coordinate system . The first mode describes the change of cell area through isotropic expansion and contraction - it accounts for the majority of the shape variations for both cell lines . The second mode shows four regions of variation that alternate between contraction and protrusion ; the contraction and protrusions are diametrically opposed along the cell periphery , indicating directional cell migration . Modes 3 - 6 describe shape variations with increasingly larger number of protrusion / contraction regions that are smaller in size . The cell shape 𝛺 ( 𝜃 , 𝑡 ) can be approximated using linear combination of these major modes , Text 6 𝛺 ( 𝜃 , 𝑡 ) ≈ ∑ 𝛼 4 ( 𝑡 ) 𝜙 ; = = = ⃗ ( 𝑡 ) ! 4 < = ( 2 ) where 𝛼 4 ( 𝑡 ) is the amplitude along the axis 𝜙 ; = = = ⃗ . We can then write a stochastic equation of motion for each cell shape that based on the time - lapse images of the whole migration trajectory , in which the parameters connect the cytoskeleton dynamics to the shape determination ( Supporting Information ) . To determine if this shape - space can help to distinguish migrators and non - migrators , we projected every single cell shape in this space , in particular the 2D plane formed by the first and the second modes . The joint probability density , ρ ( α 1 , α 2 ) , shows the distribution of the coordinates in the plane . For both cell lines , all non - migrators’ coordinates ( α 1 , α 2 ) are confined in a small area close to origin ( Fig . 2 E and Fig . 2 G ) , because non - migrators have low amplitudes in shape variation modes 1 and 2 . In contrast , the coordinates of migrators ( α 1 , α 2 ) spread much wider , corresponding to higher amplitudes in shape variation modes 1 and 2 . The migrators occupy space completely separated from non - migrators in NIH3T3 cells ( Fig . 2 F ) . In LN229 , coordinates of migrators and non - migrators overlaps ; however , for migrators , the majority of its frames during their migration process reside outside the non - migration region ( Fig . 2 H and Fig . S3 ) . The latter is consistent with the observation that some LN229 cells can switch between migratory and non - migratory states . We compared all the 2D planes in the 6 - dimensional shape - space and found that the plane of the modes 1 and 2 offers the best segregation of migrators and non - migrators ( Combinations of other shape modes are in Fig . S4 . ) . These results suggest that the complex shape variations for mammalian cells can be reduced to 6 - dimensions . The coordinates of cell shape in this low - dimensional space , especially in the plane of the first and second shape modes , can discriminate migrator vs . non - migrator . We acquired an additional set of cell migration data with exactly the same experimental settings as a validation dataset . We Text 7 showed that the prediction accuracy for NIH3T3 ( 5394 frames from 87 cells ) is 97 % for migrators and 95 % for non - migrator ; the prediction accuracy for LN229 ( 2790 frames from 45 cells ) is 98 % for migrators and 90 % for non - migrators . Spatiotemporal persistence determines cell migration dynamics To explain why a single shape can describe migration dynamics , we explored how cell shape is related to the spatiotemporal persistence of migration dynamics . With the assumption of an equilibrium cell shape ( 10 ) , the coordinates in the shape - space can indicate the potential persistence in shape deformation . As a cell changes its shape , the displacement of a membrane point is coupled to its neighboring points both spatially and temporally . To investigate how cells spatiotemporally coordinate the shape deformation in terms of contraction and protrusion , and the deformation dynamics leads to migration dynamics , we analyzed the spatiotemporal correlation using both short - term ( 30 minutes ) and long - term ( 10 hours ) cell membrane displacement data . The spatiotemporal correlation , 𝐶 > ( 𝑟𝛥𝜃 , 𝑠𝛥𝑡 ) , measures the lack of independence between two membrane points 𝜇 ( 𝜃 4 , 𝑡 4 ) and 𝜇 ( 𝜃 4 + 𝑟𝛥𝜃 , 𝑡 4 + 𝑠𝛥𝑡 ) . A detailed description can be found in Supporting Information . Two membrane points have a positive correlation when they both show positive ( or negative ) displacements , and vice versa . We first use 30 - minute migration data to clearly identify migrator and non - migrator and their characteristics , then use 10 - hour long migration data to address if the cell migration pattern can change over time . Taking a typical migrator and a typical non - migrator ( NIH3T3 ) and using only 30 minutes of their migration data , we showed that their spatiotemporal correlation functions are drastically different . The migrator has much larger negative and positive correlation spatiotemporally ( Figs . 3 A - C ) , as compared with the non - migrator ( Figs . 3 D - F ) . For the Text 8 migrator ( Fig . 3 A ) , the spatial correlation shows about half of the cell is positively correlated , while the other half is negatively correlated – this observation is more clearly indicated in the zeroth line contour plot ( Fig . 3 C ) – indicating that half of the cell is protruding while the other half is contracting , the most efficient form of migration with one single protrusion . The spatial correlation for the non - migrator , on the other hand , shows no large - scale correlation ( Fig . 3 D ) and numerous transitions between positive and negative correlation . Since the cell membrane deformation is bi - directional , inward and outward , positive correlation in time corresponds to persistent protrusion or contraction , and negative correlation in space means a large area of the membrane deform in the opposite direction , corresponding to coordinated protrusion and contraction . Negative correlation therefore is important for directional migration ( 11 ) . The frequent transition between negative and positive correlation for non - migrators signifies the lack of both spatial and temporal persistence . On the contrary , two clearly distinct regions of positive correlation of the correlation map ( Fig . 3 B and Fig . 3 C ) and a negative correlation region characterize a migrator . The width of the negative correction in space is roughly π , which is the distance between the “front” and “back” of cell along the circular map . Discussion We next analyzed the spatiotemporal correlation of long - term ( 10 hours ) migration . From the cell trajectories , it is clear that in addition to migrator and non - migrator , many cells transition between migration and resting , confirming that cell migration is a plastic , dynamical process . We chose cells with distinct migration behaviors to show spatiotemporal signatures of cell migration in terms of shape deformation . We showed that the correlation magnitude is not a feature for distinguishing migrator vs . non - migrator due to time averaging . The more persistent the migration , the less frequent transitions between positive and negative correlation ( Figs . 4 G - I ) . Text 9 The temporal persistence length corresponds to the duration of cell migration ( Fig . 4 G ) . For both the persistent migrator and the intermittent migrator , the width of negative correlation is smaller than π / 2 . We also observed that migrator has spatial correlation width greater than π / 2 . To further test the width threshold of the negative correlation region , we analyzed data of a cell that went through the process of polarization and initiation of directional migration . The correlation contour ( Figs . 4 G - I ) shows that the width of negative correlation region increased from 0 to π . We also verified that the duration for the cell directional migrating equals to the temporal length of negative correlation region that is wider than π / 2 . Further detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal contour plots revealed more subtle migration dynamics , for example turning ( Fig . S5 ) . Discussion In summary , we analyzed quantitatively over a million images of cell morphology to determine if cell shape can discriminate cell migration behavior . The answer is a clear yes – when projected into the low - dimensional shape - space , the migrators and the non - migrators can be segregated . The discovery that a low - dimensional ( 6 - dimensions ) space accounts for 99 % of all cell shape variation , for both mouse fibroblast and human glioblastoma cells , is a surprise . Even the simple stereotypical , highly persistent ‘fan’ shape of keratocytes requires 4 dimensions for 93 % of the cell shape variation ( 4 ) . Furthermore , the remarkable resemblance of the shape - spaces between the mouse fibroblast and human glioblastoma suggests the possibility of a combined common shape - space for the two cell lines . The implication is that , despite the vast genetic and phenotypic differences between the two cell lines , their morphologies during migration share enough similarities such that the differences are only reflected in the distributions in the space . This idea is tantalizing : can we use the differences in the shape - space to further distinguish different cells ? Only a large number of morphology data with different cell Text 10 lines can answer this question . Complex cell shapes and rich behaviors can emerge from interactions across different scales . Our study highlights that the spatial - temporal coordination of these interactions is essential for understanding the mechanism of cell behavior and shape determination .

S1 to S5 Supplementary References 2 Supplementary Materials and Methods Substrate Preparation Published protocols were followed with certain modifications to prepare the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) coated polyacrylamide ( PAA ) gel on coverslips for cell culture and imaging of cell migration ( 1 ) . Briefly , cleaned 22 × 22 mm glass coverslips were first activated with 2 % ( v / v ) 3 - aminopropyltrimethoxysilane ( 281778 - 100ML , Sigma Aldrich ) . Working solution containing the final concentrations of 7 . 5 % acrylamide ( 161 - 0140 , Bio - Rad ) and 0 . 3 % bis - acrylamide ( BP1404 , Fisher Scientific ) in Milli - Q water ( 296 . 75 µL ) for making 8 . 6 kPa PAA gels were added between Rain - X wiped hydrophobic glass slide surface and amine activated coverslips . Coverslips with PAA gels attached were removed from the microscope slide surface upon the completion of the PAA polymerization ( ~ 10 min at room temperature ) initiated by TEMED ( BP150 - 20 , Fisher Scientific ) and 10 % ( w / v ) Ammonium Persulfate ( BP179 - 100 , Fisher Scientific ) and kept hydrated in water . The surface of the PAA gel on the coverslips were activated by incubation with hydrazine hydrate ( 225819 - 250G , Sigma Aldrich ) to cross - link with sodium meta - periodate ( 20504 , Thermo Fisher ) oxidized Fibronectin ( FN , 33016015 , Thermo Fisher ) . These FN coated PAA gel attached coverslips were then maintained hydrated in 1× phosphate buffer saline ( pH 7 . 4 , 10010023 , Thermo Fisher ) before being used for cell plating . Cell Culture Complete cell culture medium was made of high glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Media ( DMEM , 10 - 013 - CV , Corning ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , 26 - 140 - 079 , Fisher Scientific ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin solution ( 30 - 001 - CI , Corning ) . Both NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line and doxycycline inducible GFP - LN229 cell line ( gift from Dr . Van Meir , Emory University , 3 Atlanta , GA ) were cultured with complete cell culture medium in T25 flasks under standard humidified culture condition in a 37 °C incubator with 5 % CO 2 prior to plating the cells onto FN coated PAA gel attached coverslips . A final concentration of 5 µM DiI ( D282 , Thermo Fisher ) was used to label NIH3T3 cells according to manufacturer’s instructions . Cells were plated and incubated for 6 h and then washed with fresh medium before imaging . Cells were observed to divide normally during and after the 10 h imaging . Microscopy and Live Cell Imaging Time - lapse epifluorescence imaging of the cell migrations of DiI labeled NIH3T3 cells and doxycycline induced GFP - LN229 cells on FN coated PAA gel surface was carried out on a Nikon Eclipse 80i upright microscope equipped with a mercury lamp , heating stage , Nikon ( Melville , NY ) Plan Fluor 20× 0 . 5 NA objective , Hamamatsu ORCA - Flash 4 . 0 V2 COMS camera . The heating stage was set to 37 °C . A homemade program was used to control a shutter of the mercury lamp to reduce photobleaching and Micro - Manager was used to control hardware and to take time - lapse image with 1 min interval . Live cell fluorescence images were also obtained on a Leica ( Wetzlar , Germany ) SP8 inverted microscope with a confocal galvonometric scanner , motorized stage , mercury lamp , heating state , Argon laser with 458 nm , 488 nm , and 514 nm wavelengths . Leica application Suite - Advanced Fluorescent software was used to control acquisition . Images were acquired every minute for up to 10 h using HC PL APO 20x / 0 . 75 CS2 air WD 0 . 62 mm objective . Cell Shape Extraction 4 Single cell image stacks were extracted from the NIH3T3 and LN229 live cell imaging data sets by manual cropping the non - overlapping cells for the migration durations . Homemade macros with ImageJ ( 1 . 51n ; National Institutes of Health ) were used to threshold every single cell image , creating static frames of cell boundaries as text files . Cell shape sequences were then computed using Matlab ( R2016b ) Linux ( 64 - bit ) . We have analyzed 517 NIH3T3 cells and 510 LN229 cells , 373 , 796 frames in total ; for validation , we used additional 87 NIH3T3 cells ( 5394 frames ) and 45 LN229 cells ( 2790 frames ) . Analysis of Cell Shape and Motion Montage image of each cell was processed using Matlab ( The MathWorks Inc . , Natick , Massachusetts , 9 . 1 ( R2016b ) Linux ( 64 - bit ) ) to obtain cell shape dynamics data . Shape data Ω ( 𝑋 ! " # , 𝑌 " # ) were obtained using the text image of each cell in the Cartesian system set by the first frame , where ( 𝑋 ! " # , 𝑌 " # ) represents the coordinates of cell contour , and the centroid 𝑐 ( 𝑖Δ𝑡 ) = ( 𝑥 ! " # , 𝑦 ! " # ) was calculated for each time point . Further we defined the instantaneous cell speed as the displacement of the centroid , 𝑣⃗ ( 𝑡 ) = $ ( # & " # ) ( $ ( # ) " # at time interval of Δ𝑡 equals to 1 minute . The mean square displacement ( MSD ) of a cell is defined as : 𝑀𝑆𝐷 ( 𝑛𝛥𝑡 ) = ) * ∑ 78𝑥 ! + # − 𝑥 ( ! ( ) ) + # : , + 8𝑦 ! + # − 𝑦 ( ! ( ) ) + # : , < * ! - ) , ( S . 1 ) where 𝑛 is the total number of frames for the cell of interest . We fit the MSD data with a persistent random walk model : 𝑀𝑆𝐷 ( 𝛥𝑡 ) = 2𝑃 , 𝑆 , 7 + # . − 1 + 𝑒 ( ! " # < + 4𝜎 , , ( S . 2 ) 5 where 𝑃 is the persistent time , and 𝑆 is the instantaneous cell speed . We understand the differences in 𝑃 and 𝑆 for migrators and non - migrators using the stochastic differential equation for cell velocity , v , without external bias ( 2 ) : 𝑑𝑣 ( 𝑡 ) = −𝛽𝑣 ( 𝑡 ) + √𝛼𝑑𝑊 ( 𝑡 ) , ( S . 3 ) where 𝛽 is the decay rate of the velocity , W ( t ) is the Weiner process with a magnitude 𝛼 . The persistent time and the cell speed can be derived as 𝑆 = H𝛼 / 𝛽 and 𝑃 = 1 / 𝛽 . We showed that migrators have longer persistent time and the non - migrators have greater magnitude of the random fluctuation in speed ( Fig . 1 I ) . To analyze the cell shape dynamics at the subcellular level , we used the circular mapping , the centroid was defined as the origin 𝑂 , the radial distance from 𝑂 to the cell contour were calculated for each frame of image . We further represented the cell shape as 𝛺 ( 𝜃 , 𝑡 ) , the radial distance from 𝑂 to the cell contour at the direction 𝜃 , with 𝜃 = 0° being fixed in the right - hand direction on the horizontal axis as in the Cartesian system . Based on which we computed cell shape deformation 𝜇 ( 𝜃 , 𝑡 ) as change of the radial distance in direction 𝜃 . We finely discretized the cell contour using 𝜃 for spatial resolution and there was no rotational cell membrane segment motion being considered . This setting is sufficient for the live cell imaging data that we obtained , noticed that other approached might be necessary for more complicated cell shape deformation . Shape Modes Analysis Cell contour was extracted as intensity isoline from each static frame of cell image using Celltool ( 3 ) . The contours were then aligned along their long axes to eliminate pose and relative position . To decompose this space into a basis set of orthogonal " shape modes " , principal components analysis was then performed on a large population of single cell images , for each cell 6 line respectively . The obtained major modes 𝜙 / QQQ⃗ ( 𝜃 ) were ranked by the percentage of variation that they captured . Prediction Accuracy The images are acquired for 61 minutes at the rate of one minute per frame . We collected 45 LN229 cells ( 2790 frames ) and 10 ( 620 frames ) of which are migrators . For NIH3T3 , we collected 87 cells ( 5394 frames ) in total , and 22 cells ( 1364 frames ) are migrators . Each frame is treated as an identical data point . We first extracted cell contours ( 10939 for NIH3T3 , 5760 for LN229 ) from outlies that we obtained using ImageJ ( 1 . 51n ; National Institutes of Health ) . And then 𝛼 ) and 𝛼 , were calculated for each contour using the cell shape variation modes ( Fig . 2 C and Fig . 2 D ) . The prediction accuracy is calculated , for migrator and non - migrators separately , as the number of cell frame correctly identified divided by the total number of single cell frames . Joint Probability Density Cell shape coordinates in the shape - space from each cell static frame of cell image was approximated using major cell shape variation modes . The magnitudes 𝛼 ! ( 𝑡 ) were used as data for discrete random variables 𝛼 ! assuming that 𝑓 0 $ , 0 % S𝛼 ! ( 𝑡 ) , 𝛼 2 ( 𝑡 ) T = 𝑓 0 $ | 0 % 𝑃 S𝛼 2 = 𝛼 2 ( 𝑡 ) T = 𝑃 S𝛼 ! = 𝛼 ! ( 𝑡 ) | 𝛼 2 = 𝛼 2 ( 𝑡 ) T 𝑓 0 $ 8𝛼 ! ( 𝑡 ) : . ( S . 4 ) Joint probability density 𝜌8𝛼 ! , 𝛼 2 : was computed for all combinations of ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) with 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗 . Spatiotemporal Correlation Cell shape deformation 𝜇 ( 𝜃 , 𝑡 ) was discretized in space and time . 𝛥𝜃 = 2𝜋 / 𝑁 , Δ𝑡 is one minute and total time 𝑇 = ( 𝑀 + 1 ) Δ𝑡 . The spatiotemporal correlation was computed as : 7 𝐶 4 ( 𝑠𝛥𝜃 , 𝑟𝛥𝑡 ) = ‘ ) 5 ( 6 ( 7 ) ∑ ∑ 𝜇 * , 8 ∙ 𝜇 * & 9 , 8 & 7 6 ( 7 8 - ) * , 𝑠 ≥ 0 ) 5 ( 6 & 7 ) ∑ ∑ 𝜇 * , 8 ∙ 𝜇 * & 9 , 8 & 7 6 & 7 8 - ) * , 𝑠 < 0 ( S . 5 ) We chose not to remove the mean from cell shape deformation 𝜇 ( 𝜃 , 𝑡 ) for the following reasons . First , mean value is not biologically meaningful . E [ 𝜇 ( 𝜃 , 𝑡 ) ] over 𝜃 is the instantaneous speed at 𝑡 , which varies in time . Second , 𝜇 ( 𝜃 , 𝑡 ) is also displacement of membrane segment in the angle 𝜃 , so mean displacement is not useful . Removing the mean E [ 𝜇 ( 𝜃 , 𝑡 ) ] ( : , # ) only scales down correlation magnitude . Equation of motion and deformation Cell motility is traditionally characterized by cellular level parameters , such as velocity and directional persistence of the centroid of the cell . The centroid of a cell performing a persistent random walk can be described as a Langevin equation . We assume that each bit of the membrane , called a membrane element , also follows a generalized Langevin equation ( 2 ) : 𝑑𝑣 ! ( 𝑡 ) = −𝛽 / QQQ⃗ ; 𝑣⃗ ( 𝑡 ) 𝑑𝑡 + 𝛼 ! ; 𝑑𝑊 ! ( 𝑡 ) , ( S . 6 ) where the velocity of each cell membrane element 𝑣 ! is affected by the deterministic resistance to the element’s motion and the random fluctuations W ! ( t ) with amplitude 𝛼 ! . Given a time series of a cell , we can fit the motion of every element in this form . The matrix , 𝐵 = i𝛽 ! , 2 j , characterizes the temporal relations of the displacements between membrane elements : 𝐵 ( 𝑖 , 𝑖 ) < 0 corresponds to contraction of the 𝑖 th membrane element , while 𝐵 ( 𝑖 , 𝑖 ) > 0 corresponds to an extension ; 𝐵 ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) > 0 implies that the 𝑖 th and 𝑗 th membrane elements move in the same direction , and vice versa . This matrix is the effective interaction network amongst all membrane elements , the interactions include contributions from the cytoskeleton , membrane tension , myosin contraction , and all other possible interactions including fluid pressure or flow . 8 Each cell shape has the coordinate ( 𝑥 ) , 𝑥 , , … 𝑥 < ) in the 𝐾 - dimensional orthogonal shape space Φ : 𝛺 ( 𝜃 ! ) = ∑ 𝑥 2 ( 𝑡 ) φ 2 ( 𝜃 ! ) < 2 - ) . Replacing 𝑣 ! ( 𝑡 ) with dΩ ( 𝜃 ! ) / 𝑑𝑡 , we have −𝛽 / QQQ⃗ ; ∑ 𝑑𝑥 2 ( 𝑡 ) 𝜑 2 < 2 - ) + 𝛼 ! ; 𝑑𝑊 ! ( 𝑡 ) = ∑ 𝑑 , 𝑥 2 ( 𝑡 ) 𝜑 2 ( 𝜃 ! ) < 2 - ) . ( S . 7 ) This equation of motion describes the shape and migration dynamics in terms of the effective interaction network amongst membrane elements . It connects cell shape dynamics and cell movement behavior . 9 Supplemental Figure 1 . Simple shape measurements do not show significant differences between migrator and non - migrator .
