Deregulation of Rac1 signaling has also been linked to a number of diseases , including cancer . The diversity of Rac1 functioning in cells is mainly attributed to its ability to bind to a multitude of downstream effectors following activation by Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors ( GEFs ) . Despite the identi ﬁ cation of a large number of Rac1 binding partners , factors in ﬂ uencing downstream speci ﬁ city are poorly de ﬁ ned , thus hindering the detailed understanding of both Rac1 ’ s normal and pathological functions . In a recent study , we demonstrated a role for 2 Rac - speci ﬁ c GEFs , Tiam1 and P - Rex1 , in mediating Rac1 anti - versus pro - migratory effects , respectively . Importantly , via conducting a quantitative proteomic screen , we identi ﬁ ed distinct changes in the Rac1 interactome following activation by either GEF , indicating that these opposing effects are mediated through GEF modulation of the Rac1 interactome . Here , we present the full list of identi ﬁ ed Rac1 interactors together with functional annotation of the differentially regulated Rac1 binding partners . In light of this data , we also provide additional insights into known and novel signaling cascades that might account for the GEF - mediated Rac1 - driven cellular effects .

However , due to the diverse , and sometimes contradictory , functions of Rac1 , an effective therapy would require prior determination of how signaling outputs down - stream of Rac1 are selected . The pleiotropic effects of Rac1 are mediated mainly through its ability to bind to a multitude of downstream effectors upon activation by Guanine nucleo - tide Exchange Factors ( GEFs ) . 10 , 11 Yet , mechanisms in ﬂ uenc - ing Rac1 downstream signaling speci ﬁ city , through modulating effector binding , are poorly understood . Interestingly , it has been proposed that GEFs might regulate Rac1 downstream speci ﬁ city through serving as scaffolding proteins . 11 - 17 How - ever , a challenge facing the ﬁ eld was the discrimination between GEF - driven regulation of Rac1 functions and changes induced as a consequence of differences in cell type and / or upstream cues from the Extracellular Matrix ( ECM ) . To address these limitations we recently performed a study directly comparing the ability of 2 distinct Rac - spe - ci ﬁ c GEFs to regulate Rac1 downstream signaling . 18 Focus - ing on Tiam1 and P - Rex1 , which have been associated with contrasting migratory phenotypes , 19 - 24 we ﬁ rst demonstrated that activation of Rac1 by Tiam1 or P - Rex1 , irrespective of cell type or upstream signaling , promotes Rac1 anti - vs . pro - migratory effects , respectively . 18 Next , to rigorously evaluate the contribution of GEFs in regulating Rac1 signal - ing through modulating effector binding , we performed a quantitative proteomic analysis of the Rac1 interactome upon activation by either GEF . Via utilizing Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture ( SILAC ) coupled with StrepII - FLAG Tandem Af ﬁ nity Puri ﬁ cation ( SF - TAP ) , we showed that activation of Rac1 by either Tiam1 or P - Rex1 results in distinct changes in the Rac1 interactome . Importantly , through characterizing Rac1 binding to protein ﬂ ightless - 1 homolog ( FLII ) , a novel P - Rex1 - enriched Rac1 interactor , we demonstrated that , indeed , GEF modulation of the Rac1 interactome is crucial for mediating GEF - spe - ci ﬁ c Rac1 signaling cascades . 18 We now present the full list of Rac1 interacting proteins identi ﬁ ed from the SILAC SF - TAP screens and extend our recently published bioinfor - matics analysis to include the full list of GEF - speci ﬁ c differ - entially regulated Rac1 binding partners . We also discuss additional modes by which Tiam1 and P - Rex1 might induce Rac1 anti - versus pro - migratory phenotypes in light of the newly highlighted Rac1 interactors . Thus , together with our recent ﬁ ndings , data presented here provide clear evidence supporting a role of GEFs in regulating Rac1 signaling via modulating Rac1 binding to downstream effectors . 18 This CONTACT Angeliki Malliri Angeliki .

Further characterization of these interactions promises to uncover previously unreported GEF - mediated signaling cascades that regulate Rac1 - driven cellular functions . Results and discussion Identi ﬁ cation of GEF - mediated Rac1 interactome changes by SILAC SF - TAP proteomic analysis As described in our recent publication , to quantitatively evaluate whether Tiam1 and P - Rex1 modulate Rac1 - effector binding , NIH3T3 cells transduced with a dual doxycycline ( dox ) - inducible system for expressing StrepII - FLAG - tagged Rac1 ( SF - Rac1 ) alone or together with Wild Type ( WT ) or GEF - dead mutant ( GEF (cid:1) ) versions of Tiam1 or P - Rex1 were labeled using SILAC . Due to the limited number of labeling isotopes we designed 5 - way SILAC and reverse SILAC screens in which cells were divided into 2 sets . The ﬁ rst set ( set1 ) included the SF - Rac1 alone expressing cells together with SF - Rac1 C Tiam1 WT and SF - Rac1 C P - Rex1 WT co - expressing cells , while the second set ( set2 ) included the SF - Rac1 alone expressing cells again , as a common ref - erence , with SF - Rac1 C Tiam1 GEF (cid:1) and SF - Rac1 C P - Rex1 GEF (cid:1) co - expressing cells . This setup allowed the compari - son of the proteomes within each set directly as well as between set1 and set2 relative to the common reference . 18 Following SILAC labeling , lysates from the differentially labeled cells were subjected to SF - TAP 25 , 26 to pulldown SF - Rac1 and its binding partners . Eluates within each set were combined and concentrated . Concentrated mixed eluates were then separated by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacryl - amide Gel Electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) , digested with tryp - sin and analyzed by Liquid Chromatography - tandem Mass Spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS ) . Finally , the produced data was processed using the MaxQuant software ( Fig . 1A ) . In total 350 putative Rac1 interactors were identi ﬁ ed from 2 SILAC and 2 reverse SILAC SF - TAP screens ( Sup - plementary File 1 , Tables S . 1 - S . 3 ) . Importantly , as outlined Figure 1 .

Three SILAC labeling media containing different lysine ( K ) and arginine ( R ) isotope combinations were utilised : L = Light K0 C R0 ; M = Medium K4 C R6 ; H = Heavy K8 C R10 .

MAREI ET AL . in our recent manuscript , analysis of the full list of proteins uncovered a number of known and predicted Rac1 binding partners in addition to proteins involved in mediating Rac1 signaling . 18 This indicated the robustness of the SILAC SF - TAP approach in identifying genuine Rac1 binding part - ners . We further analyzed a subset of 231 proteins that were associated with SILAC ratios in (cid:2) 2 experiments ( Sup - plementary File 1 , Table S . 2 ) . SILAC ratios were then used to determine GEF - induced changes in Rac1 binding by applying a cut - off of § 1 . 3 - fold - change , 27 thereby classify - ing proteins identi ﬁ ed under each GEF into interactors that show inconsistent / no change in Rac1 association , proteins with reduced Rac1 binding and proteins with increased Rac1 binding relative to SF - Rac1 alone expressing cells . Only proteins that exhibited consistent GEF - associated Rac1 binding patterns in (cid:2) 2 experiments were considered for further analysis ( Fig . 1B ) . To identify Rac1 interactors that could account for the distinct GEF - mediated Rac1 down - stream effects , we next compared proteins with altered Rac1 binding upon Tiam1 WT or P - Rex1 WT expression to their respective GEF (cid:1) mutants , thus highlighting proteins that bind mainly to active Rac1 . These lists were then cross - ref - erenced to one another to further eliminate overlapping proteins between both GEFs . As described in our recent publication , out of the 231 proteins , 159 showed overlap between the different GEF constructs . Tiam1 WT expres - sion resulted in speci ﬁ c regulation of 15 proteins , Tiam1 GEF (cid:1) of 14 proteins , P - Rex1 WT of 31 proteins and P - Rex1 GEF (cid:1) of 12 proteins . 18 All together , this indicated that Tiam1 and P - Rex1 are indeed capable of speci ﬁ cally modu - lating the Rac1 interactome . Insight into Tiam1 - mediated Rac1 anti - migratory effects through modulating Rac1 - effector binding The role of Tiam1 - Rac1 signaling in cell migration and inva - sion is controversial with some reports suggesting an inhibitory role , 8 , 19 , 21 , 28 - 31 while others implicating Tiam1 in promoting Figure 2 . Activation of Rac1 by Tiam1 but not P - Rex1 increases E - cadherin levels at cell - cell contacts in A431 cells . A431 cells transduced with the doxycycline ( dox ) - induc - ible GEF expression system were treated with ethanol ( - dox ) or 1 m g ml ¡ 1 dox ( C dox ) for 24 hours . Cells were then ﬁ xed and localization of E - cadherin was detected by immuno ﬂ uorescence . Fluorescence markers against HA - tagged Tiam1 WT / GEF (cid:1) or Myc - tagged P - Rex1 WT / GEF (cid:1) were used to detect the expression of the respective GEF constructs upon dox induction . DAPI was used to visualize the nuclei . Scale bar D 20 m M . CELL CYCLE 1963 migration . 32 - 40 This is mainly due to the fact that Tiam1 - medi - ated activation of Rac1 regulates both actin cytoskeleton rear - rangements as well as cell - cell and cell - matrix adhesions . It has thus been proposed that the effects of Tiam1 - Rac1 signaling are cell type and substrate speci ﬁ c . 41 , 42 A clear example of such in ﬂ uence is evident from the ability of Tiam1 , through Rac1 activation , to enhance E - cadherin - mediated cell - cell contacts when Ras transformed MDCKII ( MDCK - f3 ) cells are plated on ﬁ bronectin or laminin , while promoting migration through inducing membrane ruf ﬂ ing and lamellipodia formation when cells are plated on different types of collagen . 42 However , via bypassing ECM signaling cues , we have recently shown that expression of Tiam1 in different cell lines results exclusively in Rac1 - driven anti - migratory phenotypes . 18 This suggests that Tiam1 , in the absence of ECM signaling interference , might function predominantly to inhibit Rac1 - driven cell migration and invasion . Tiam1 - Rac1 anti - migratory effects are largely linked to their role in promoting cadherin - mediated cell - cell contacts . 19 , 21 , 29 , 30 We recently demonstrated that expression of Tiam1 WT but not GEF (cid:1) mutant results in increased cellu - lar aggregation and enhanced actin localization at cell - cell contacts to induce a compact epithelial - like morphology in A431 cells . 18 We now show that Tiam1 WT expression , but not P - Rex1 WT or the GEF (cid:1) mutants , enhances E - cadherin recruitment to cell - cell contacts ( Fig . 2 ) . Thus , consistent with previous reports , our data strongly suggests that Tiam1 - mediated Rac1 anti - migratory effects might be a consequence of stronger cell - cell contacts . To link these observations to Rac1 interactors that exhib - ited Tiam1 WT - speci ﬁ c changes in Rac1 binding , we uti - lised Ingenuity Integrated Pathway Analysis ( IPA ) to categorise these proteins according to their cellular func - tions ( Fig . 3 ) . Among the identi ﬁ ed proteins , the known Figure 3 . Functional classi ﬁ cation of proteins with Tiam1 WT - speci ﬁ c changes in Rac1 binding .

MAREI ET AL . Rac1 effector , IQGAP1 , was associated with a number of functional categories that could account for Tiam1 WT - mediated Rac1 - driven effects ( Fig . 3A ) . SILAC ratios indi - cated that IQGAP1 exhibits increased Rac1 binding speci ﬁ - cally upon expression of Tiam1 WT ( Fig . 4A and Supplementary File 1 , highlighted in Table S . 2 ) . To further validate the screen we performed SF - TAP of SF - Rac1 from NIH3T3 cells transduced with the dual dox - inducible co - expression system . Analysis of IQGAP1 levels co - precipi - tated with SF - Rac1 revealed that , as indicated by the IQGAP1 associated SILAC ratios , expression of Tiam1 WT , but not P - Rex1 WT or the GEF (cid:1) mutants , results in increased Rac1 - IQGAP1 binding . In contrast , consistent with our recent observations , 18 co - expression of either GEF with SF - Rac1 did not induce any changes in Rac1 - RhoGDI1 binding ( Fig . 4B ) . IQGAP1 is implicated in various signaling processes , such as cytoskeleton reorganization , cell - cell adhesion and proliferation . 43 It has also been shown that , through its abil - ity to bind to actin , IQGAP1 links Rac1 and Cdc42 to the actin cytoskeleton . 44 , 45 Moreover , IQGAP1 can regulate actin assembly via serving as a calmodulin - regulated barbed - end actin capping protein . 46 Given the role of IQGAP1 in regulating the actin cytoskeleton , increased Rac1 binding following activation by Tiam1 could be important in mediating the extensive membrane ruf ﬂ ing and increased actin accumulation at cell - cell contacts associ - ated with Tiam1 WT expression . 18 Intriguingly , IQGAP1 has been shown to promote migration through disrupting the interaction between E - cadherin and its binding partner b - catenin , which in turn mediates the disas - sembly of cell - cell contacts . 47 , 48 However , given our recent ﬁ nd - ings indicating that Tiam1 WT expression results in increased cellular aggregation and membrane ruf ﬂ ing accompanied by reduced cell migration , we recently proposed that the increased Rac1 - IQGAP1 interaction mediated by Tiam1 might negatively regulate IQGAP1 function . 18 Indeed , increased activation of Rac1 and binding to IQGAP1 has been shown to inhibit IQGAP1 - b - catenin interaction , as well as impede IQGAP1 - mediated a - catenin translocation from the cadherin - catenin complex . 48 - 50 Alternatively , it is possible that under the cellular context investigated IQGAP1 is important for maintaining cell - cell contacts . Consistent with this , IQGAP1 has been implicated in establishing Vascular Endothelial ( VE ) - cadherin - mediated cell - cell contacts in human endothelial cells 51 and enhancing cell - cell contacts in endocrine cells . 52 In either case , it seems that through stimulating Rac1 - IQGAP1 binding above normal levels , Tiam1 directs IQGAP1 to enhance cell - cell contacts , thereby reducing cell migration . In addition to its function as a regulator of cell - cell contacts , IQGAP1 has been shown to interact with components of the exocyst complex , including Sec3 , Sec8 and Exo70 and is thus believed to play an important role in exocytosis . 53 , 54 Interest - ingly , Tiam1 - mediated Rac1 activation has been linked to increased transcriptional and post - transcriptional upregulation of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase - 1 ( TIMP - 1 ) and TIMP - 2 , respectively , while not affecting the secreted levels or activity of Matrix Metalloproteinase - 9 ( MMP - 9 ) or MMP - 2 . 28 It is , therefore , possible that an increased interaction between Rac1 and IQGAP1 plays a role in promoting the secretion of TIMP - 1 and TIMP - 2 by exocytosis to protect against ECM degradation , thereby supressing cell invasion . Thus it would be interesting to analyze the extracellular levels of TIMPs upon Tiam1 expression and assess its dependency on IQGAP1 . Understanding this mechanism could have important implica - tions on Rac1 - driven cancer dissemination . Figure 4 . Rac1 - IQGAP1 interaction is enhanced upon activation of Rac1 by Tiam1 .

MAREI ET AL . Insight into P - Rex1 - mediated Rac1 pro - migratory effects through modulating Rac1 - effector binding Functional analysis of the identi ﬁ ed Rac1 interactors also highlighted a number of signaling proteins involved in promoting cell migration . Proteins displaying P - Rex1 WT - speci ﬁ c altered Rac1 binding are of particular interest as fur - ther characterization of their role in Rac1 signaling promises to shed light on novel regulatory mechanisms by which Rac1 promotes migration and cancer dissemination ( Fig . 5 ) . Figure 6 . ( For ﬁ gure legend , see page 1968 . ) CELL CYCLE 1967 Among the P - Rex1 WT - speci ﬁ c enriched Rac1 binding part - ners ( Fig . 5A ) , we recently identi ﬁ ed the gelsolin superfamily member , FLII as a novel Rac1 interactor . Functional charac - terization of this interaction revealed that P - Rex1 promotes Rac1 - FLII binding , which facilitates P - Rex1 - FLII - dependent and RhoA - ROCK - independent cell contraction required for mediating Rac1 - driven cell migration . Thus , this study pro - vided clear evidence supporting the role of P - Rex1 in modu - lating Rac1 downstream function through dictating speci ﬁ c Rac1 - effector protein complexes . 18 In addition to FLII , SILAC ratios also indicated increased Rac1 binding to a - actinin 1 ( Actn1 ) upon P - Rex1 WT expression ( Fig . 5A and Supplementary File 1 , highlighted in Table S . 2 ) . Interestingly , both Actn1 and Rac1 have been shown to contribute to the formation of non - contractile dorsal stress ﬁ bers that promote cell migration and spread - ing . 55 This hints at another potential mechanism by which P - Rex1 might promote Rac1 pro - migratory phenotypes through enhancing Rac1 - Actn1 binding to stimulate dorsal stress ﬁ ber formation . The SILAC SF - TAP screens also shed light on more antici - pated mechanisms by which P - Rex1 might promote Rac1 pro - migratory effects . Rac1 has been shown to contribute to lamel - lipodia formation through activating the Arp2 / 3 protein com - plex . 56 Given that P - Rex1 WT expressing cells are associated with the formation of actin - rich thin extended membrane pro - trusions , 18 it is possible that P - Rex1 utilizes the Arp2 / 3 protein complex machinery to promote Rac1 - driven actin polymeriza - tion necessary for the formation of these protrusions . Consis - tent with this notion , 3 subunits of the Arp2 / 3 protein complex , namely Arpc1b , Arpc2 and Arp3 , were identi ﬁ ed as increased Rac1 binding partners under P - Rex1 WT but not P - Rex1 GEF (cid:1) in a single SILAC SF - TAP experiment . More inter - estingly , these components show decreased Rac1 binding upon expression of Tiam1 WT as inferred from their SILAC ratios ( Supplementary File 1 , highlighted in Table S . 1 ) . It is , there - fore , likely that the ability of Tiam1 and P - Rex1 to differen - tially modulate Rac1 binding to the Arp2 / 3 protein complex is important for the observed differential effects upon activation of Rac1 by either GEF . GEF activity - independent scaffolding role of GEFs Through deciphering the role of P - Rex1 - mediated Rac1 - FLII interaction in promoting cell migration we uncovered a scaffolding function of P - Rex1 . Biochemical analysis indi - cated that P - Rex1 WT stimulates the Rac1 - FLII interaction through directly binding to FLII . Importantly , both P - Rex1 WT and its GEF (cid:1) mutant exhibited comparable FLII interac - tion , suggesting that while Rac1 activation is important for Rac1 - FLII binding , the P - Rex1 GEF activity is not required for the P - Rex1 - FLII interaction . This provided strong evi - dence suggesting a GEF activity - independent scaffolding role of GEFs in cells . 18 To gain additional insight into the P - Rex1 GEF scaffold - ing function , we screened the list of Rac1 interactors for pro - teins with opposing Rac1 binding patterns upon expression of Tiam1 and P - Rex1 , irrespective of their GEF activity . Among the identi ﬁ ed proteins , the actin capping protein tro - pomodulin - 3 ( TMOD3 ) , was the only protein associated with increased SILAC ratios upon P - Rex1 expression and decreased SILAC ratios upon Tiam1 WT expression ( Fig . 6A and Supplementary File 1 , highlighted in Table S . 2 ) . Using protein gel blot analysis we demonstrated that SF - Rac1 co - precipitates endogenous TMOD3 in NIH3T3 cells expressing SF - Rac1 ( Fig . 6B ) . Additionally , we also con ﬁ rmed that expression of P - Rex1 WT in MCF7 cells , unlike Tiam1 WT , is associated with an increased Rac1 - TMOD3 interaction as indicated by the Duolink in situ Proximity Ligation Assay ( PLA ) used to visualize the endogenous interaction between Rac1 and TMOD3 ( Fig . 6C , D ) . Taken together , this indi - cates that TMOD3 is a bona ﬁ de Rac1 interactor that exhib - its enhanced Rac1 binding in a P - Rex1 - dependent manner . Intriguingly , according to the SILAC SF - TAP screens , expression of both P - Rex1 WT and P - Rex1 GEF (cid:1) was asso - ciated with increased Rac1 - TMOD3 binding ( Fig . 6A and Supplementary File 1 , highlighted in Table S . 2 ) . This sug - gests that activation of Rac1 is not important for this inter - action to occur , and implies that TMOD3 may not directly contribute to the observed P - Rex1 - Rac1 - driven cellular phe - notypes . Nevertheless , analysis of Ingenuity IPA generated protein - protein networks indicated a potential interaction between TMOD3 and FLII ( Fig . 6E ) . 57 Indeed , further bio - chemical analysis using NIH3T3 cells expressing P - Rex1 WT in a dox - inducible manner revealed that TMOD3 and FLII interact on an endogenous level and that expression of P - Rex1 WT stimulates this interaction ( Fig . 6F ) . This hints at a potential role of GEFs as scaffolding proteins not only for Rac1 but also for Rac1 effectors . The increased FLII - TMOD3 interaction , may thus play a Rac1 - independent Figure 6 .

In addition to TMOD3 , the SILAC SF - TAP screens also highlighted a number of other proteins that exhibited GEF - speci ﬁ c changes in Rac1 binding upon expression of Tiam1 GEF (cid:1) and P - Rex1 GEF (cid:1) , further supporting a role of GEFs as scaffolding proteins , irrespective of Rac1 activation . Functional analysis of these proteins using Ingenuity IPA analysis suggests that , in addition to modulating Rac1 - effec - tor binding , GEFs might also mediate Rac1 interaction with regulatory proteins potentially in ﬂ uencing Rac1 levels , sub - cellular localization and post - translational modi ﬁ cation ( Fig . 7 and Fig . 8 ) . Therefore , analysis of these proteins might also shed light on additional modes by which GEFs modulate Rac1 signaling through spatial and temporal regulation . Conclusions Due to the complexity of Rac1 signaling under normal and pathological conditions , it is crucial to identify factors that con - tribute to its downstream speci ﬁ city . Through conducting a comparative analysis of Rac1 - driven cellular functions upon activation by 2 Rac - speci ﬁ c GEFs , Tiam1 and P - Rex1 , we pro - vide clear evidence highlighting their role in dictating differen - tial Rac1 - dependent cellular processes .

MAREI ET AL . these differential effects to the ability of each GEF to induce speci ﬁ c changes to the Rac1 interactome , through serving as scaffolding proteins . Additionally , our data suggest that this scaffolding function might extend , not only to Rac1 but also to Rac1 binding partners . This expands the biological signi ﬁ cance of GEFs beyond their ability to activate Rac1 . GEFs might also contribute to Rac1 spatial and temporal regulation , irrespective of Rac1 activation status . Therefore , functional analysis pro - vided in this manuscript serves as a mining tool for known and novel Rac1 interactors that are regulated through GEFs . Future studies of these proteins promise to provide novel mechanistic insight into GEF - mediated Rac1 signaling cascades that will aid in further dissecting the role of GEFs in dictating Rac1 signaling .

Methods Antibodies Details of antibodies used in this study are summarised below . Constructs and cell lines Please refer to Marei et al . 18 for details of expression plasmids and cell lines utilised in this study . Immuno ﬂ uorescence A431 cells grown on coverslips in the presence of ethanol ( - dox ) or 1 m g ml ¡ 1 doxycycline ( C dox ) for 24 hours were ﬁ xed , mounted and imaged using the Low Light microscope system as described by Marei et al . 18 Rat anti - E - cadherin ( DECMA - 1 ; Abcam , ab11512 ) was used to visualize GEF - induced changes to E - cadherin localization . Fluorescence markers against HA - tagged Tiam1 WT / GEF (cid:1) or Myc - tagged P - Rex1 WT / GEF (cid:1) were used to detect the expression of the respective GEFs upon dox induction . DAPI was used to stain the nuclei . Duolink in situ Proximity Ligation Assay ( PLA ) MCF7 cells transduced with the GEF dox - inducible system were seeded on glass coverslips in the presence of 1 m g ml ¡ 1 dox for 24 hours . Cells were then ﬁ xed in 4 % formaldehyde and subjected to the Duolink in situ Proximity Ligation Assay ( PLA ) . Mouse anti - Rac1 ( BD Biosciences , 610650 ) and rabbit anti - TMOD3 ( Sigma - Aldrich , HPA001849 ) were used together with the respective Duolink in situ PLA probes ( Olink Biosci - ence , anti - mouse 92004 - 0100 , anti - rabbit 92002 - 0100 ) and the Duolink in situ detection reagent kit ( Olink Bioscience , 92013 - 0100 , 92014 - 0100 ) according to manufacturer ’ s instructions . Coverslips were mounted onto slides using ProLong Gold anti - fade reagent with DAPI stain ( Life Technologies , P36935 ) . Phalloidin and DAPI were used to visualize the actin cytoskele - ton and the nuclei , respectively . Images were captured on the Low Light microscope system using ﬁ xed focus and exposure settings to ensure that differences detected in the Duolink sig - nal are only due to changes in Rac1 - TMOD3 binding . Quanti ﬁ - cation of the Duolink signal was performed as described by Marei et al . 18 Immunoprecipitation and StrepII - FLAG Tandem Af ﬁ nity Puri ﬁ cation ( SF - TAP ) Cells were lysed in lysis buffer [ 30 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % Nonidet P40 ( v / v ) , 1 % protease inhibitor cocktail ( v / v ) , 1 % phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 ( v / v ) in dH 2 O ] . For immunoprecipitation , lysates were incubated with 20 - 50 m l antibody pre - bound to GammaBind G Sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare , 17 - 0885 - 01 ) for 2 hours at 4 (cid:3) C , washed and resuspended in 25 m l 2x SDS - PAGE sample buffer [ 50 % NuPAGE LDS sample buffer 4X ( Life Technologies , NP0008 ) ( v / v ) , 20 % NuPAGE sample reducing agent 10X ( Life Technol - ogies , NP0004 ) ( v / v ) in dH 2 O ] for protein gel analysis .

Proteins were transferred onto Immobolin PVDF membranes ( Millipore , IPFL00010 ) and pro - tein gel blot analysis was performed using indicated antibodies and visualized on Hyper ﬁ lm ECL ( GE Healthcare , 28 - 9068 ) using the ECL western blotting analysis system ( GE Healthcare , RPN2109 ) . Adobe Photoshop software was used to crop full blots and band integrated densities were quanti ﬁ ed using the ImageJ software . SILAC labeling and mass spectrometry protein identi ﬁ cation NIH3T3 cells transduced with the dual dox - inducible co - expression system were labeled and processed as described by Marei et al . 18 SILAC SF - TAP screen validation , ratio classi ﬁ cation and Ingenuity analysis Protein lists generated from the SILAC SF - TAP experiments were analyzed using available protein databases , such as the Human Protein Reference Database ( HPRD ) , 58 NetPath 59 and the Human Protein - Protein Interaction Predictions ( PIPs ) data - base . 60 , 61 These databases coupled with an extensive literature search were used to determine the ef ﬁ ciency of the SILAC SF - TAP screens in identifying bona ﬁ de Rac1 binding partners , through classifying identi ﬁ ed proteins into known Rac1 binding partners , predicted Rac1 binding partners and proteins involved in Rac1 signaling as outlined in our recent manuscript . 18 Pro - teins with SILAC ratios in (cid:2) 2 experiments were classi ﬁ ed using a cut - off of § 1 . 3 SILAC ratio fold - change 27 to identify proteins that show changes in Rac1 binding compared to control cells expressing SF - Rac1 alone . Generated protein lists for each GEF were analyzed using the Ingenuity IPA tool ( Ingenuity Systems , http : / / www . ingenuity . com ) . This allowed the clustering of pro - teins according to their functional roles in cells . Ingenuity pro - tein - protein networks were generated for protein lists displaying altered Rac1 binding identi ﬁ ed under each GEF .
