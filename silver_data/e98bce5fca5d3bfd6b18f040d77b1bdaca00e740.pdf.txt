Allen , Angus L . Dawe , and Donald L . Nuss * Center for Biosystems Research , University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute , College Park , Maryland 20742 - 4450 Received 18 June 2003 / Accepted 22 August 2003 Hypoviruses are a family of cytoplasmically replicating RNA viruses of the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonec - tria parasitica . Members of this mycovirus family persistently alter virulence ( hypovirulence ) and related fungal developmental processes , including asexual and sexual sporulation . In order to gain a better understanding of the molecular basis for these changes , we have developed a C . parasitica cDNA microarray to monitor global transcriptional responses to hypovirus infection . In this report , a spotted DNA microarray representing approximately 2 , 200 C . parasitica genes was used to monitor changes in the transcriptional proﬁle after infection by the prototypic hypovirus CHV1 - EP713 . Altered transcript abundance was identiﬁed for 295 clones ( 13 . 4 % of the 2 , 200 unique cDNAs ) as a result of CHV1 - EP713 infection—132 up - regulated and 163 down - regulated . In comparison , less than 20 speciﬁc C . parasitica genes were previously identiﬁed by Northern analysis and mRNA differential display as being responsive to hypovirus infection . A 93 % validation rate was achieved between real - time reverse transcription - PCR results and microarray predictions . Differentially ex - pressed genes represented a broad spectrum of biological functions , including stress responses , carbon metabolism , and transcriptional regulation . These ﬁndings are consistent with the view that infection by a 12 . 7 - kbp hypovirus RNA results in a persistent reprogramming of a signiﬁcant portion of the C . parasitica transcriptome . The potential impact of microarray studies on current and future efforts to establish links between hypovirus - mediated changes in cellular gene expression and phenotypes is discussed . Viruses are widely distributed throughout the kingdom Fungi ( 2 ) . Members of the mycovirus family Hypoviridae are distinguished by the ability to persistently attenuate virulence ( hypovirulence ) and stably alter dependent developmental processes , e . g . , asexual and sexual sporulation , of their host , the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica ( 13 ) . They are also the ﬁrst viruses of ﬁlamentous fungi for which a re - verse genetics system was developed , providing the capability to manipulate the genomes of both a eukaryotic virus and its host . Consequently , hypoviruses are unique experimental tools for gaining deeper insights into virus - host interactions and revealing fundamental processes underlying fungal pathogen - esis . The pleiotropic nature of hypovirus - mediated phenotypic changes suggested the perturbation of one or more key regu - latory pathways ( 13 ) . Subsequent studies implicated two prin - cipal signal transduction pathways in the manifestation of hy - povirus - induced phenotypic changes : G - protein - linked , cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) - mediated ( 5 , 7 , 20 , 37 ) and calcium / calmodulin / inositol trisphosphate - dependent ( 31 , 32 ) signaling cascades . However , evidence for hypovirus - mediated alteration of these pathways has relied predominantly on single - gene analyses to monitor pathway activity , e . g . , the 13 - 1 gene for G - protein - linked , cAMP - mediated signaling and the lac - 1 ( laccase ) gene for calcium / calmodulin / inositol trisphosphate - dependent sig - nal transduction . Using differential mRNA display , Chen et al . ( 5 ) reported that more than 400 PCR products either in - creased ( n (cid:2) 296 ) or decreased ( n (cid:2) 127 ) in abundance as a result of infection by the prototypic hypovirus CHV1 - EP713 . Moreover , similar changes in the accumulation of approxi - mately 65 % of these PCR products were observed when G - protein / cAMP signaling was altered in the absence of hypovi - rus infection . Kang et al . ( 25 ) subsequently used the more sensitive ordered differential display approach to estimate that 20 % of the total C . parasitica genes were modulated following hypovirus CHV1 infection . While mRNA differential display can provide a good indication of the relative extent to which transcriptional proﬁles change , considerable additional effort is required to determine the identities of differentially ex - pressed genes . We now report the successful use of a spotted expressed sequence tag ( EST ) array derived from a C . para - sitica EST ( CEST ) library consisting of over 4 , 200 sequences representing approximately 2 , 200 unique genes ( 12 ) to monitor hypovirus - mediated global changes in host gene expression . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and media . Hypovirus - free C . parasitica strain EP155 ( ATCC 38755 ) and isogenic strain EP155 / CHV1 - EP713 ( ATCC 52571 ) , which is infected with the prototypic hypovirus CHV1 - EP713 ( 45 ) , were maintained on potato dextrose agar ( PDA ; Difco , Detroit , Mich . ) at 22 to 24°C with a 12 - h light - dark cycle at 1 , 300 to 1 , 600 lx . Cultures used for RNA preparations were grown under similar conditions on cellophane membranes overlaying PDA ( PDA - cellophane ) . Total RNA isolation . Cultures used for RNA isolation were grown on PDA - cellophane for 6 days and harvested by freezing the mycelia in liquid nitrogen and then immediately grinding the mycelia into a ﬁne powder by using a mortar and pestle . The powder was resuspended in RNA extraction buffer ( 200 mM NaCl , 100 mM Tris - Cl [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 4 mM EDTA [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate [ SDS ] , 2 mM dithiothreitol ) at a ratio of 4 ml of buffer per g of mycelia . This step was followed sequentially by extraction with equal volumes of water - * Corresponding author .

Single - stranded RNA was precipitated on ice for 2 h by the addition of LiCl to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 M . The single - stranded RNA precipitate was collected by centrifugation , resuspended in 2 ml of double - distilled H 2 O , reprecipitated by the addition of 2 . 5 volumes of ice - cold ethanol and 0 . 1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate ( pH 5 . 2 ) , and incubated for 30 min at (cid:3) 20°C . The RNA was collected by centrifugation , washed with 2 ml of ice - cold 75 % ethanol , dried , and treated wit h 2 U of RQ1DNase ( Promega ) in 0 . 5 ml of 20 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) – 20 mM MgCl 2 in the presence of 40 U of RNasin ( Pro - mega ) fo r 1 h at 37°C . Following phenol - chloroform and chloroform extractions , the RNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 100 (cid:4) l of double - distilled H 2 O . Microarray slide printing . An ordered CEST library was constructed from cDNA prepared from a mixed mRNA population isolated from hypovirus CHV1 - EP713 - infected C . parasitica strain EP155 and uninfected C . parasitica strain EP155 cloned into the (cid:5) ZipLox vector ( Invitrogen ) ( 12 ) . A large majority ( 95 . 7 % ) of the inserts were sized at 500 to 2 , 000 bp , and sequencing of 4 , 216 clones from the 5 (cid:6) end yielded an average read length of 608 bp ( 12 ) . A subset of this CEST library was selected for microarray printing by removal of ESTs corresponding to the hypovirus genome and to the highly abundant hydrophobin gene cryparin . The resulting 3 , 864 ESTs , representing approximately 2 , 200 unique genes , were reordered to form the array EST ( AEST ) library used for printing . The accuracy of library reordering was ensured by sequencing eight AEST clones from each 96 - well plate used to organize the library . Correspon - dence between CEST and AEST library clone designations can be accessed at http : / / www . umbi . umd . edu / (cid:7) cbr / aesttocest . pdf . PCR fragments used for printing the microarray chip were ampliﬁed from the AEST library by using Sp6 and T7 primer sites ﬂanking the inserts in standard 100 - (cid:4) l PCR mixtures . PCR products were analyzed on gels to conﬁrm the success of the reactions and were subse - quently puriﬁed by using MultiScreen - PCR plates ( Millipore ) . Puriﬁed PCR products were resuspended in 50 (cid:4) l of 3 (cid:8) SSC ( 1 (cid:8) SSC is 0 . 15 M sodium chloride plus 0 . 015 M sodium citrate [ pH 7 . 0 ] ) for printing . Microarray printing and hybridization were performed at the University of Maryland Biotechnology In - stitute Center for Biosystems Research DNA Microarray Core Facility , which is equipped with an Affymetrix 417 Arrayer and 418 Scanner ( http : / / www . umbi . umd . edu / (cid:7) cab / microarraymain . html ) . Puriﬁed PCR products were arrayed in duplicate on poly - L - lysine - coated glass slides with an average spot diameter of 100 (cid:4) m and a spot spacing of 300 (cid:4) m . Following printing , the spotted cDNA was cross - linked to the surface of the slides ( at 65 mJ ) by using a StrataLinker instrument and washed with a 1 % SDS solution to minimize the background . Slides were subsequently placed in a blocking solution containing 0 . 2 M succinic anhydride and 0 . 05 M sodium borate prepared in 1 - methyl - 2 - pyrrolidinone for 20 min , washed for 2 min in 95°C water , and rinsed ﬁve times in 95 % ethanol . Slides were spin dried at 500 rpm for 5 min and stored for future hybridizations . Fluorescent probe generation for hybridization . Fluorescence - labeled cDNA probes were prepared from total RNA puriﬁed from uninfected or CHV1 - EP713 - infected C . parasitica strain EP155 ( 60 (cid:4) g per probe ) by direct incorpo - ration of Cy3 - or Cy5 - labeled dUTP with Superscript II reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) and 2 (cid:4) g of oligo ( dT ) primer according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by using a Microcon - 30 spin column , and the puriﬁed probes were combined for further processing immediately prior to hybridization . Microarray hybridization and scanning . Printed slides were prepared for hybridization by the addition of 30 (cid:4) l of prehybridization solution , which con - tained 50 % formamide , 6 (cid:8) SSPE ( 1 (cid:8) SSPE is 0 . 15 M NaCl , 0 . 01 M NaH 2 PO 4 , and 0 . 001 M EDTA ) , 0 . 5 % SDS , 5 (cid:8) Denhardt’s solution , and 100 (cid:4) g of salmon sperm DNA / ml , to the arrayed surface of a glass slide ( covered with a coverslip to evenly distribute the prehybridization solution ) . The slide was incubated for 30 min at 42°C in a hybridization chamber . Fluorescence - labeled probes were dried and resuspended in 20 (cid:4) l of hybridization solution , which contained 50 % form - amide , 6 (cid:8) SSPE , 0 . 5 % SDS , 5 (cid:8) Denhardt’s solution , blocking solution [ 2 (cid:4) g of poly ( dA ) , 4 (cid:4) g of yeast tRNA , 10 (cid:4) g of salmon sperm DNA ) ] , 14 (cid:4) l of master mix solution ( 70 % formamide , 3 (cid:8) Denhardt’s solution , 0 . 7 % SDS ) , and 6 (cid:4) l of 20 (cid:8) SSPE . The resuspended probes were heated to 100°C for 2 min , vortexed , and collected by a brief spin in a microcentrifuge . The probes were applied to the arrayed surface , covered with a coverslip , and placed in a hybridization chamber overnight at 42°C . Hybridized slides were washed in each of three solutions ( solution 1 is 1 (cid:8) SSC – 0 . 1 % SDS , solution 2 is 2 (cid:8) SSC – 0 . 1 % SDS , and solution 3 is 2 (cid:8) SSC ) for 10 min , spun dry , scanned in both Cy3 and Cy5 channels with an Affymetrix 418 Scanner at a 10 - (cid:4) m resolution and a 70 % photomultiplier tube value , and exported as 16 - bit TIFF images for analysis . Microarray data processing and analysis . Integrated pixel intensity values for each spot were calculated by using TIGR Spotﬁnder software and saved in tab - delimited format for use by TIGR MIDAS software ( The Institure for Genomic Research [ TIGR ] , Rockville , Md . ; http : / / www . tigr . org / software ) . All hybridization data from three sets of dye - swap experiments were normalized simultaneously in MIDAS to correct for experimental error within a speciﬁc hybridization and between repeated hybridizations . With the data processing functions present within MIDAS , intraslide normalization was achieved by ap - plying a locally weighted linear regression ( LOWESS ) algorithm ( smoothing factor , 0 . 33 ) on the log ratio - log product plot of the data set for each hybridiza - tion ( on a block - by - block basis ) and adjusting the Cy5 signal for each clone by its calculated LOWESS factor . Interslide normalization was achieved by rescaling the Cy3 and Cy5 signals for each spot on a chip by using the standard deviation of Cy3 and Cy5 signals measured across all hybridizations . Selection of differentially expressed clones in each hybridization was per - formed by importing the normalized ( and rescaled ) Cy3 and Cy5 values calcu - lated in MIDAS into the Functional Genomics module of Spotﬁre DecisionSite 7 . 0 ( Spotﬁre , Inc . , Somerville , Mass . ; www . spotﬁre . com ) . The log 2 ( Cy3 / Cy5 ) ratio for each clone was calculated , and the clones were divided into groups based on the number of standard deviations by which a speciﬁc clone log 2 ratio varied from the data set average log 2 ratio . Clones with log 2 ratios equal to or greater than (cid:9) 2 standard deviations in a minimum of four of six hybridizations were considered differentially expressed . Genes identiﬁed as differentially ex - pressed were hierarchically clustered in Spotﬁre DecisionSite 7 . 0 . Validation of differentially expressed clones through real - time RT - PCR . Twenty - eight clones predicted to be differentially expressed by microarray anal - ysis were tested by quantitative reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR with an Applied Biosystems ( Foster City , Calif . ) GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system and an Applied Biosystems TaqMan RT kit . A single cycle consisting of 10 min at 25°C , 40 min at 48°C , and 5 min at 95°C was used to reverse transcribe 100 ng of RQ1 - treated RNA in a 100 - (cid:4) l reaction mixture containing 10 mM Tris - Cl ( pH 8 . 3 ) , 50 mM KCl , 5 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 500 (cid:4) M each deoxynucleoside triphosphate , 2 . 5 (cid:4) M random hexamer , 0 . 4 U of RNase inhibitor , and 1 . 25 U of Multiscribe reverse transcriptase / ml . The transcript abundance of each clone of interest was then measured by using quantitative PCR with TaqMan master mix reagents . For each real - time PCR , 2 . 5 (cid:4) l of cDNA was incubated with 1 (cid:4) M each forward and reverse primers and 200 nM probe . For each template measured , 18S rRNA ( 1 : 1 , 000 dilution of cDNA ) was measured for normalization . Transcript abun - dance relative to the amount of 18S rRNA in the sample was calculated by using the comparative threshold cycle method ( 23 ) with the primers and conditions described by Parsley et al . ( 37 ) . RESULTS Microarray design and data analysis . The CEST library used in this study was prepared from RNAs isolated from both virus - free C . parasitica and hypovirus CHV1 - EP713 - infected C . parasitica to increase the representation of expressed fungal genes ( 12 ) . Based on BLAST analysis and classiﬁcations ac - cording to Gene Ontology Consortium ( www . geneontology - . org ) guidelines , the collection was generally representative of the entire population of expressed genes ( 12 ) . Reordering of the library for microarray printing ( AEST library ) provided the opportunity to verify clone identity as well as remove certain highly redundant sequences and clones that yielded little or no sequence information . In this manner , the 3 , 864 spotted cD - NAs still represented each of the predicted 2 , 200 gene prod - ucts , or between 20 and 25 % of the total gene coding potential of C . parasitica ( 12 ) . Additional elements were incorporated into the design of the CEST spotted array to enhance conﬁdence in the microar - ray results . A number of control cDNAs were spotted on the microarray to guide data analysis software selection . These included CHV1 - EP713 coding regions for p29 , p48 , and sev - eral EST clones representing different portions of open read - ing frame B that would be expected to increase in signal in - 1254 ALLEN ET AL .

Clones containing cDNAs corre - sponding to ribosomal proteins L8 , L3 , L15 , S10 , S27 , S8 , S25 , and S6 and 18S rRNA were included to represent genes not expected to be altered in expression upon hypovirus infection . Clones with no predicted sequence homology to the C . para - sitica genome were included to monitor signal background levels ; these included Escherichia coli proteins NusA , LacI , AraC , and RecJ . In addition , each of the 3 , 864 EST clones was spotted in duplicate . Finally , real - time RT - PCR was used to verify differential transcript accumulation for a subset of genes predicted by microarray analysis to be differentially expressed . Previous differential mRNA display studies ( 5 , 25 ) suggested the potential for large differences in speciﬁc mRNA levels upon virus infection . To avoid data processing problems asso - ciated with cDNA spots that may not have been detectable in one channel due to complete gene repression in the presence or absence of hypovirus , we used the MIDAS software package from TIGR ( http : / / www . tigr . org / software ) . This software uses a LOWESS algorithm to separate a ﬂuorescent signal of bio - logical signiﬁcance from noise that is characteristic of microar - ray studies ( 40 ) . This package identiﬁed all control spots in at least ﬁve of the six hybridization replicates performed in this study ( Table 1 ) while avoiding the selection of clones with aberrant signals . mRNA quality was also monitored by spotting all four exons of the C . parasitica endothiapepsin ( epn - 1 ) gene . These exons showed similar magnitudes of a decrease in tran - script abundance following hypovirus infection in at least four of six hybridizations ( data not shown ) , suggesting minimal lev - els of RNA degradation . Hypovirus CHV1 - EP713 - mediated modulation of C . para - sitica transcript accumulation . Figure 1 displays scatter plots for data obtained from four complete hybridizations of the C . parasitica microarray chip with two independent RNA prepa - rations . Hybridization 1 was performed with probes speciﬁc for RNA isolated from uninfected strain EP155 labeled with Cy3 - dUTP and for RNA isolated from CHV1 - EP713 - infected strain EP155 ( EP155 / CHV1 - EP713 ) labeled with Cy5 - dUTP . Hybridization 1R ( where R means reciprocal ) was performed with probes made against the same RNA preparations but labeled with the opposite dye : the EP155 / CHV1 - EP713 probe was labeled with Cy3 - dUTP , and the EP155 probe was labeled with Cy5 - dUTP . Reciprocal hybridizations 2 and 2R were per - formed similarly but with an independent set of RNA prepa - rations as a template for probe synthesis . All four hybridiza - tions displayed a tightly packed proﬁle of normalized signal intensity ratios , suggesting that the two independent RNA preparations used for these hybridizations were of similar qual - ity ( note the common dynamic range of each hybridization along the x and y axes ) . The level of experimental variation between hybridizations is illustrated for a positive control hy - povirus sequence , p48 ( shaded red triangles ) , and a down - regulated EST clone , AEST - 05 - C - 02 ( shaded green circles ) . The magnitude of differential expression for these two genes was conﬁrmed by real - time RT - PCR ( p48 data not shown ; AEST - 05 - C - 02 data shown in Table 2 ) . While minor ﬂuctua - tions in magnitude were observed for p48 and AEST - 05 - C - 02 measurements , the relative positions within each data set for the two genes were largely consistent between hybridizations . Figure 2 shows a hierarchical clustering of genes that were scored as differentially expressed and demonstrates the varia - tion between gene measurements across the three reciprocal ( six total ) hybridizations performed . The intensity of red or green blocks in Fig . 2 is reﬂective of log 2 ( Cy3 / Cy5 ) measure - ments for each gene across hybridizations . Because of missing data ( gray blocks ) , attributable to hybridization anomalies , or low log ratios ( black blocks ) for some genes , we chose to designate a gene as differentially expressed if the correspond - ing log ratio was at least 2 standard deviations from the exper - imental average log ratio for a minimum of four of the six hybridizations performed . On the basis of this criterion , a total of 295 EST clones , 13 . 4 % of the 2 , 200 unique genes repre - sented on the microarrray , were scored as being responsive to CHV1 - EP713 infection . The accumulation of transcripts for 132 genes was observed to increase after hypovirus infection , while decreases in transcript accumulation were observed for 163 genes . In an effort to gain insight into the biological signiﬁcance of the CHV1 - EP713 - mediated change in the host transcriptional proﬁle , the differentially expressed ESTs were related to pu - tative biological processes assigned by Dawe et al . ( 12 ) accord - ing to classiﬁcation guidelines outlined by the Gene Ontology Consortium ( www . geneontology . org ) . Since a number of genes on the microarray chip were represented by multiple EST clones ( 12 ) , the list of differentially expressed clones was ini - tially ﬁltered to ensure that GenBank identiﬁcation numbers were present only once . Nevertheless , the list still retained a small number of clones ( less than 10 % of the list ) with distinct GenBank identiﬁcation numbers that were identiﬁed as the same protein in different organisms ( for example , AEST - 03 - E - 12 and AEST - 13 - A - 03 are cytochrome P450 monooygenases from Penicillium paxilli and Neurospora crassa , respectively ) . Assignments by Dawe et al . ( 12 ) were limited to genes with BLAST E values of 10 (cid:3) 10 or less , corresponding to 162 of the 295 differentially expressed genes . As indicated in Table 1 , 118 hypovirus - responsive genes were broadly distributed through - out the available biological process categories , consistent with the pleiotrophic nature of CHV1 - EP713 - mediated phenotypic changes . An additional 44 showed signiﬁcant matches with genes of unknown function . Microarray versus real - time RT - PCR analysis . Although several features had been built into the microarray design to enhance conﬁdence in the microarray results , it was important to validate the differential expression values by independent means . Real - time RT - PCR was adopted because of its high level of sensitivity , its potential speed of validation , and the requirement for low quantities of test material compared to those needed for Northern analysis ( 3 ) . A subset of 28 genes predicted by microarray analysis to be differentially expressed was chosen for conﬁrmation based on putative function or magnitude of differential transcript accu - mulation . Each clone tested by kinetic RT - PCR was measured in triplicate for each of two independent RNA isolations ( Ta - ble 2 ) .

C ELL on F eb r ua r y 20 , 2013 b y PE NN S T A T E UN I V h tt p : / / e c . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m DISCUSSION One of the remarkable features of hypovirus infection is the ability of a 12 . 7 - kbp genome to stably alter multiple phenotypic traits , ranging from asexual sporulation to virulence . Previous studies with mRNA differential display technologies indicated that these broad phenotypic changes correlated with extensive and persistent alterations in the host transcriptional proﬁle ( 5 ) . The construction of a C . parasitica cDNA microarray now provides many advantages over previous labor - intensive tech - niques for monitoring transcriptional responses to hypovirus infection . Simultaneous monitoring of the responses of 2 , 200 unique C . parasitica cDNA clones in the present study revealed 295 CHV1 - EP713 - responsive host genes , corresponding to 13 . 4 % of the unique genes contained on the C . parasitica cDNA microarray chip . This value compares well with the estimate of 20 % obtained by Kang et al . ( 25 ) using an ordered differential display and is not inconsistent with the report by Chen et al . ( 5 ) using a conventional mRNA differential display . Assuming that C . parasitica , like the closely related fungus N . crassa ( 19 ) , has approximately 10 , 000 genes within its genome , it is likely that CHV1 - EP713 infection results in altered tran - script accumulation for approximately 1 , 300 host genes . Microarray and real - time RT - PCR results were in excellent agreement with respect to the direction of changes in transcript accumulation , i . e . , up - regulated or down - regulated ; however , results from the two methods did differ occasionally in the magnitude of changes . This ﬁnding was not surprising , given that cross - hybridization between closely related genes can oc - cur on the surface of the microarray slide . Moreover , the ﬂu - orescent signal corresponding to a speciﬁc mRNA probe can be titrated out due to the presence of redundant copies of the sequence on the microarray slide . Although the accuracy of microarray data can be problematic ( 40 , 51 , 53 ) , the 93 % validation rate obtained for the C . parasitica chip ( Table 2 ) provides a high level of conﬁdence in the list of responsive genes presented in Table 1 . It is noteworthy that the microarray results showed a level of inconsistency with published observations for two previously characterized C . parasitica genes—the laccase gene lac - 1 and the gene encoding endothiapepsin , epn - 1 . Based on Northern analysis , lac - 1 transcripts were previously reported to be down - regulated after hypovirus infection ( 8 , 31 , 41 ) . CHV1 - EP713 infection was reported to cause no change in endothiapepsin protein production and secretion ( 9 ) .

In this regard , the C . parasitica microarray pro - vides a powerful new tool with which to examine the inﬂuence of culture conditions on the magnitude and spectrum of hypo - virus - induced symptom expression and host gene expression ( 37 ) . The microarray analysis presented here has expanded the number of identiﬁed C . parasitica genes that respond to hypo - virus infection from less than 20 ( 13 , 25 ) to nearly 300 . It is clear from Table 1 that these genes are potentially associated with a wide range of biological processes . A comprehensive understanding of the signiﬁcance of these cellular responses to hypovirus replication and hypovirus - mediated changes in host phenotype , including hypovirulence , will require additional studies . The 133 responsive genes of unknown function ( sup - plemental data are available at http : / / www . umbi . umd . edu / (cid:7) cbr / 155 _ 713SUPdata . pdf ) represent an additional rich resource for future research . However , several host transcriptional re - sponses that were identiﬁed and conﬁrmed in this study merit discussion in terms of their potential relevance to hypovirus - mediated symptom expression and virus replication . Table 3 provides speciﬁc identities and associated BLAST information for all clones discussed below . Hypovirus infection alters transcript accumulation for se - lected host stress response genes . The homologues of two genes that are transiently induced in classic responses to spe - ciﬁc extracellular and intracellular stresses , heat shock protein 70 ( HSP70 ) and glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) , AEST - 10 - H - 10 and AEST - 12 - G - 04 , respectively , are constitutively up - regulated following CHV1 - EP713 infection ( 35 , 42 ) . However , the increased accumulation of these transcripts was not accom - panied by altered transcript accumulation for the many addi - tional heat shock and classical stress response genes in the CEST library ( 12 ) , suggesting the absence of a general stress response . Moreover , as indicated in Table 1 , a second HSP70 homologue ( AEST - 38 - C - 04 ) showed reduced transcript accu - mulation . In this regard , the persistent nature of the hypovirus infection differs signiﬁcantly from the acute changes associated with classical stress responses ( 16 ) . While the increase in tran - script accumulation for these putative stress response genes ( Table 2 ) may be related to cellular defense responses to hy - povirus infection , the absence of evidence for a general stress response raises the possibility that the HSP70 and GST homo - logues belong to a subset of genes induced by hypovirus infec - tion to facilitate viral functions . Although HSPs play a major role in protection against and recovery from thermal stress , several animal and plant viruses also have been shown to regulate HSP synthesis ( 1 , 15 , 21 , 52 ) . Recruitment of cellular HSP70s to facilitate virion assembly or genome replication has been demonstrated ( 11 , 22 , 49 ) . Inter - estingly , plant closteroviruses actually encode an HSP70 that functions to facilitate cell - to - cell movement ( 38 ) . It will be of considerable interest to examine whether disruption of the C . parasitica homologue ( AEST - 10 - H - 10 ) of HSP70 effects CHV1 - EP713 replication . GSTs belong to a superfamily of isoenzymes involved in the removal of reactive oxygen species and the conjugation of glutathione with various harmful ligands , including plant phe - nols and aﬂatoxins ( 46 ) . Although fungal GSTs have not been extensively characterized , studies with other organisms have suggested that GSTs actually participate in a wide range of cellular functions not directly associated with detoxiﬁcation ( reviewed in reference 18 ) . GST - mediated glutathione S thio - lation of reactive cysteine residues has been implicated in reg - ulating the activity of cellular proteins ( 27 , 43 ) , including ki - nases , transcription factors , and caspases , that function in apoptosis ( 17 ) . In this regard , Kampranis et al . recently re - ported that a GST from tomato suppressed cell death caused by expression of the yeast inducer of apoptosis , Bax ( 24 ) . In this context , viral induction of GST expression may represent a countermeasure to a cellular apoptosis - mediated defense response ( 48 ) . It is also worth considering the possibility that increased glutathione S thiolation of cellular transcription fac - tors contributes to virus - mediated changes in gene expression TABLE 3 .

The constitutive elevation of GST homologue transcript levels certainly warrants an examination of the effect of hypovirus infection on the cellular redox balance . CHV1 - EP713 infection substantially elevates transcript ac - cumulation for homologues of SAMS and SAHH . Kawalleck et al . ( 6 ) previously reported the induction of S - adenosyl - L - methionine ( SAMe ) synthetase ( SAMS ) and S - adenosyl - L - homocysteine ( SAH ) hydrolase ( SAHH ) in plants following treatment with a fungal elicitor . This observation prompted the authors to suggest a link between plant defense responses and increased turnover of the activated methyl cycle . It was intrigu - ing , therefore , to observe constitutive increases in transcript accumulation for homologues of SAMS ( AEST - 08 - F - 10 ) and SAHH ( AEST - 22 - B - 11 ) ( Tables 2 and 3 ) of six - and fourfold , respectively , following CHV1 - EP713 infection . SAMS catalyzes the condensation of L - methionine and ATP to produce SAMe , which serves as the primary methyl donor in transmethylation reactions involving proteins , nucleic acids , fatty acids , and polysaccharides and as the precursor for poly - amine synthesis . Transfer of the methyl group from SAMe results in the production of SAH . Since increased accumula - tion of SAH inhibits SAMe - dependent methylation , SAH is hydrolyzed by SAHH to L - homocysteine and adenosine . Given the central role of SAMe in cellular metabolism , the constitu - tive up - regulation of these key enzymes could be anticipated to have a number of possible metabolic or physiologic conse - quences . Altered transmethylation activity due to increased SAMe levels could inﬂuence physiologic processes ranging from protein synthesis to membrane integrity . Related alter - ations in polyamine biosynthesis could inﬂuence cell cycle pro - gression and development in C . parasitica , as has been re - ported for the pathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum ( 39 ) and the ﬁssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe ( 4 ) . Associa - tions between abnormal intracellular SAMe levels and altered rates of DNA mutations and genome stability due to changes in DNA methylation patterns have been suggested ( 28 , 29 , 30 , 44 ) , and SAHH has been reported to inﬂuence senescence and cell growth ( 33 , 54 ) through its role in regulating homocysteine levels . In this context , persistent hypovirus infection of C . para - sitica may provide a particulary useful model for examining the consequences of chronic RNA virus infection on the stability of host nuclear and organellar genomes . Hypovirus infection alters a subset of C . parasitica tran - scriptional regulatory factors . There is increasing evidence to support the proposal that the pleiotrophic nature of hypovirus - mediated phenotypic changes is related to the perturbation of one or more key regulatory pathways ( reviewed in reference 13 ) . Thus , an understanding of the mechanisms underlying these changes is likely to require identiﬁcation of key control points or elements , such as receptors , that are involved in initiating signaling pathways and transcription factors that con - vert signals into changes in gene expression . Therefore , it was of interest that only 3 of 26 genes classiﬁed under the molec - ular function category “transcription regulation / transcription factors” by Dawe et al . ( 12 ) , AEST - 27 - F - 10 , AEST - 30 - C - 09 , and AEST - 05 - C - 02 , were found to be responsive to CHV1 - EP713 infection ; transcript accumulation was reduced by at least threefold for each gene ( Table 2 ) . Additionally , the prod - ucts of two of the three genes are homologues of fungal tran - scription factors that have been reported to regulate processes that are altered by hypovirus infection . Transcription factor Pro1 ( AEST - 27 - F - 10 ) is involved in controlling fruiting body formation and sexual sporulation in several ﬁlamentous fungi ( 34 ) . Mst12 ( AEST - 30 - C - 09 ) from the rice pathogen Magna - porthe grisea , a recently identiﬁed homologue of yeast Ste12 , has been shown to be important in regulating infectious hypha growth ( 36 ) . The third responsive regulatory factor homo - logue , HoxX ( AEST - 05 - C - 02 ) , is part of a bacterial two - com - ponent system involved in the regulation of a hydrogenase that oxidizes hydrogen into constituent protons and electrons and passes the electrons to the electron transport chain ( 14 ) . The potential signiﬁcance of reduced expression of this putative regulatory factor to hypovirus infection is more difﬁcult to envision . Signiﬁcant on the basis of the absence of responsive - ness were the C . parasitica cpc1 cross - pathway control tran - scription factor ( 50 ) and a number of putative transcription factors , including homologues of transcription factor PacC from N . crassa , involved in regulation of the pH response , N . crassa Cys - 3 , involved in regulation of sulfur metabolism , the hac1 transcription factor from Hypocrea jecorinal , and tran - scription factor CON7 from M . grisea . In addition to revealing new hypotheses for testing , the C . parasitica microarray now provides the opportunity to address a number of long - standing questions about hypovirus infection . It will now be possible to examine whether hypoviruses that differ in the severity of symptom expression ( 6 ) elicit similar or quite different transcriptional responses by the host . Addition - ally , it should be possible to determine whether a symptom - inducing , hypovirus - encoded gene product , such as p29 ( 10 , 47 ) , alters the expression of a speciﬁc set of cellular genes . In combination with a collection of available C . parasitica signal - ing mutants , microarray analysis could be used to identify sets of cellular genes that are regulated through speciﬁc signaling pathways and simultaneously monitor the effects of hypovirus infection on their expression . It is anticipated that this infor - mation , in turn , will provide insight into the roles of speciﬁc cellular genes and signaling pathways in the elaboration of speciﬁc virus - mediated phenotypic changes , including attenu - ation of fungal virulence .
