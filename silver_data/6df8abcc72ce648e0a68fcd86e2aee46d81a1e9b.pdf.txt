Since then , there has been steady increase in the number of cases . However , the number of cases in Nigeria is low in comparison to cases reported by other countries with similar large populations , despite the poor health system pre - vailing in the country . This has been mainly attributed to the low testing capacity in Nigeria among other factors . Therefore , there is a need for innovative ways to increase the number of persons testing for COVID - 19 . The aim of the study was to pilot a nasopharyngeal swab self - sample collection model that would help increase COVID - 19 testing while ensuring mini - mal person - to - person contact being experienced at the testing center . 216 participants took part in this study which was carried out at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research between June and July 2020 . Amongst the 216 participants , 174 tested negatives for both self - col - lected samples and samples collected by Professionals , 30 tested positive for both arms , with discrepancies occurring in 6 samples where the self - collected samples were positive while the ones collected by the professionals were negative . The same occurred in another set of 6 samples with the self - collected samples being negative and the professional—col - lected sample coming out positive , with a sensitivity of 83 . 3 % and a specificity of 96 . 7 % . The results of the interrater analysis are Kappa = 0 . 800 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 690 to 0 . 910 ) which implies an outstanding agreement between the two COVID - 19 sampling methods . Furthermore , since p < 0 . 001 Kappa ( k ) coefficient is statistically different from zero , our findings have shown that self - collected samples can be reliable in the diagnosis of COVID - 19 .

Introduction Human coronavirus belongs to a group of viruses that causes an infection in humans with four main sub - groupings known as alpha , beta , gamma , and delta coronavirus [ 1 ] . Before the advent of SARS - CoV - 2 , other types of coronaviruses including , alpha coronavirus ( 229E , NL63 ) ; beta coronavirus ( OC43 , HKU1 , MERS - CoV - causing Middle East Respiratory Syn - drome , or MERS ) , SARS - CoV - causing severe acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS , have been described [ 2 – 4 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 ( the novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 , or COVID - 19 ) ; the latest addition to the coronavirus family [ 5 ] was first identified on 17th of November 2019 from a 55 - year - old Hubeian citizen but officially announced by the Chinese Government on 8th of December 2019 [ 6 ] . By January 2020 , the disease was named COVID - 19 and declared as an epidemic by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) due to the unprecedented nature of the disease outbreak and later declared a pandemic on March 11 , 2020 [ 7 ] . From the outset of the coronavirus outbreak in China , there has been an exponential increase in infections spreading across 212 countries and territories . Statistics have shown that as of the 4 th of September 2021 , recorded cases of coronavirus had surpassed 221 million with over 4 . 5 million deaths worldwide . It was reported that many countries battled with challenges of diagnosis and effective treatment for the diseases [ 8 ] . The Nigerian Centre for Diseases Control ( NCDC ) rolled out eligibility for COVID - 19 test - ing in the country ; ( 1 ) Any person showing symptoms including fever , cough , or difficulty in breathing . ( 2 ) History of travel to and more than 24 hours of transit through any high - risk country with widespread community transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . ( 3 ) Close contact with a confirmed case of COVID - 19 ( 4 ) . Exposure to a healthcare facility where COVID - 19 case ( s ) have been reported [ 9 ] . The first case in Nigeria was recorded on February 27 , 2020 , being an imported case of an Italian expatriate and the number of cases keeps rising , affecting about 35 states so far with reported cases over 130 , 000 as of January 31 , 2021 [ 10 ] . So far , only about 1 million of the Nigerian population have been tested for COVID - 19 . Hence the need for an effective means to identify and test for cases among the teeming population of about 200 mil - lion people . Though measures are being put in place in ensuring that testing centers are made available to meet the growing need for people to be tested in Nigeria , there is still a massive gap in the testing capacity as infections soar . To expand testing in the country , there is a need for innova - tive ideas that will reduce or eliminate long waiting hours at testing sites , control crowds which is an avenue for effective spread of the virus , as well as minimize person - to - person con - tact during testing . A self - service diagnostic testing model that would expand testing was pro - posed elsewhere [ 11 ] but it has not been tried and evaluated in Nigeria . The COVID - 19 DIY sampling testing model would minimize person to person contact as well as reduce crowds presenting at testing centers . This study aims to evaluate the efficiency and success of home testing by employing a self - sampling model thereby reducing the burden on health workers and the spread of COVID - 19 infection . Methods Patients recruitment The drive - through COVID - 19 test Centre located at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research ( NIMR ) , is one of the largest testing centers in Lagos , with an average of 120 – 140 people presenting for testing daily during surge periods . Individuals who participated in this study were selected from people presenting for testing at the drive - through COVID - 19 test PLOS ONE The use of DIY ( Do it yourself ) samplingmodel for COVID - 19 qPCR testing scale up PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0259398 November4 , 2021 2 / 10 Centre . The Study procedure was explained to each individual presenting for sample collec - tion , only those that gave verbal consent were enrolled in the study . A total of 216 people con - sented to take part in the study which took place between June and July 2020 . Participants presenting , who were below 15 years of age and who too weak to carryout sample collection by themselves , were excluded from the study . Participants who gave their consent after being briefed about the study , were asked to watch a video noting the procedure , after which they were given swabs and transport medium to collect their samples individually . Participants were monitored both on site by health profes - sionals and remotely using ‘Mobihealth consult’ , a telemonitoring platform developed by Mobihealth international . This application allows health professionals to remotely monitor the sample collection process , guiding each participant to enable them collect their samples prop - erly . About 20 mins after , their samples were also collected by professionals ( healthcare work - ers ) on - site which is the gold standard for sample collection . All samples were taken to the laboratory and tested within 24 hours of collection using Roche COBAS 6800 . The COBAS 6800 , has a Positive Percent Agreement of 100 % and a Negative Percent Agreement of 100 % . With a Sensitivity and Specificity at 95 % Confidence interval of ( 95 % CI : 86 . 7 % - 100 % ) and ( 95 % CI : 96 . 3 % - 100 % ) respectively . Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were computed by finding mean and standard deviation for continuous ( numerical ) variables and frequencies for categorical variables . Sensitivity and specificity anal - ysis of the DIY test was done to determine if the test is sensitive for detecting the disease ( it is positive for most people having the disease ) and if it is specific ( it is positive for a small per - centage of those without the disease ) . This was calculated using : Sensitivity ¼ ½ð True Positive Þ = ð True Positive þ False Negative Þ� � 100 Specificity ¼ ½ð True Negative Þ = ð True Negative þ False Positive Þ� � 100 The interrater reliability analysis ( Cohen’s Kappa statistics ) was also used to measure the level of agreement between the result of the samples collected by professionals and the samples col - lected by individuals . This was calculated using the formula k ¼ p o (cid:0) p e 1 (cid:0) p e ¼ 1 (cid:0) 1 (cid:0) p o 1 (cid:0) p e where : Po = the relative observed agreement among raters . Pe = the hypothetical probability of chance agreement . Ethical approval Ethical approval was obtained from the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research Institutional Review Board ( IRB / 20 / 044 ) . Results Demographic characteristics A sample of 216 participants was used to assess the efficiency and success of self - testing . The distribution of the participants by age is shown in Fig 1 .

In addition , more than half ( 56 . 5 % ) of the participants were male . The most frequent mari - tal status was married status ( 58 . 3 % ) followed by single ( 39 . 8 % ) , and then separated ( 1 . 4 % ) while divorced status was less represented ( only 1 person was divorced ) . Exposure to COVID - 19 Out of the 216 participants , 128 ( 59 . 3 % ) had contact with suspected cases , 91 ( 42 . 1 % ) partici - pants were employed in a care facility , while 43 ( 19 . 9 % ) had attended mass gathering and 12 ( 5 . 6 % ) had contact with overseas travelers ( Fig 2 ) . Symptoms and pre - existing conditions Even though many of the study participants n = 195 ( 90 . 3 % ) , had no pre - existing conditions , among those with pre - existing conditions n = 21 ( 9 . 7 % ) , chronic liver disease and heart disease were the most reported conditions . Furthermore , 52 . 3 % of study participants had developed at Fig 1 . Respondent’s age distribution . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0259398 . g001 Fig 2 .

In addition , one person had previously tested COVID - 19 positive ( Table 1 ) . Sensitivity and specificity test The table below presents the test results of samples collected by participants ( DIY ) in compari - son with results of samples collected by healthcare workers . There are 30 true positive tests compared to 6 false - negative tests . The sensitivity is 100 ( 30 ) / ( 30 + 6 ) = 83 . 3 % . This means that 83 . 3 % of the individuals with the COVID - 19 will have a positive screening test when using the DIY test . The 6 false - positive tests and 174 true negative tests give specificity of 100 ( 174 ) / ( 174 + 6 ) = 96 . 7 % . This means that 96 . 7 % of the individuals without the COVID - 19 will test nega - tive when they use the DIY test ( Table 2 ) . Interrater reliability test : The results of the interrater analysis are Kappa = 0 . 800 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 690 to 0 . 910 ) which implies an outstanding agreement between the two COVID - 19 sampling methods .

Before there can be a roll - out of self - sampling collection kits , there is a need to ascertain and make sure that samples collected by untrained individuals would produce the comparable results as those collected by professionals . The gold standard sampling technique for the con - firmation of COVID - 19 is the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal sampling [ 12 ] . Male participants represented more than half of the study population . This corresponds with statistics from the two hardest - hit European countries which showed that the male gender accounted for the majority of COVID - 19 deaths in Italy and twice as many men as women in Spain [ 13 ] . Recent studies have shown that the male population was the most susceptible gen - der to being infected with COVID - 19 than females [ 14 ] . This trend is attributed to genetic , immunologic , and behavioral patterns exhibited by the male and female gender [ 15 ] . Behavioral lifestyle patterns among men and women tend to implicate COVID - 19 . The male gender has shown to have an increased lifestyle pattern of drinking and smoking than women [ 16 ] . The female gender tends to show higher compliance with preventive measures such as regular handwashing , use of alcohol - based sanitizers , face mask , and maintaining social distancing [ 17 ] . Furthermore , during this study , different age groups were seen among the participants . Pre - vious studies have shown that the most vulnerable age group comprising 60 years and above are made up of the elderly and immunocompromised patients [ 18 ] . However , most of the partici - pants in this study were found among the age group 30 – 39 years and the mean age 35 years . This may not be unrelated to the relatively young population structure of Nigeria , indicating that individuals of ages � 65 years as a share of total population was 2 . 7 % in 2020 [ 19 ] . These findings correlated with studies from CDC , 2020 which attributed the cause to occupational and behavioral factors thus exposing this age group to a higher risk of infection [ 20 ] Also , these younger adults tend to not adhere maximally to non - pharmaceutical prevention strategies for SARS - CoV - 2 infection such as social distancing and avoidance of crowded social gatherings . They also tend to be more asymptomatic or have mild symptoms thereby transmitting this infection to the most vulnerable age groups made up of the elderly and immunocompromised . The marital status of the participants was also considered , among all participants , married people were discovered to have the highest percentage among the participants . One of the pre - ventive measures in managing the spread of COVID - 19 includes practicing social distancing . However , this method seems to be difficult among household members which might be unknowingly infected with COVID - 19 . Reports show that among people living in the same house , the rate of infection is higher among adults , with an infection rate of 27 . 8 % amongst spouses [ 21 ] . Thus , early detection and quarantining of infected patients can help limit COVID - 19 spread between spouses and the household at large . Half of the study participants were symptomatic , amongst which symptoms such as fever , cough , and sore throat were the most experienced . This correlated with data from previous Table 2 .

Although many of the participants in this study did not have pre - existing conditions , the majority of the small percentage with pre - existing conditions had chronic kidney disease , this is in contrary to the findings of Richardson [ 22 ] which inferred that heart disease was a major pre - existing condition . Furthermore , a greater part of our study participants was in contact with a confirmed or suspected COVID - 19 case and this form of exposure is said to be respon - sible for the high infectivity rate for COVID - 19 [ 23 ] . Participants in this study were made to watch a video of how the procedure is done before trying it on site . This is to guide the participants in order to ensure a good enough sample collection procedure . Results from this study showed a specificity of 96 . 7 % and a moderately high sensitivity of 83 . 3 % , in comparison with the professionally collected sam - ples . These findings differed from a study by Abdollahi et al . [ 24 ] with a sensitivity of less than 70 % and a specificity of less than 95 % , in which , it was concluded that samples col - lected by professionals were more reliable than self - collected samples . The study by Abdol - lahi , however , was carried out on a small sample size of 50 patients , which might be a factor in the result realized , also , the median age of participants was 56 years compared to our study which had a median age of 35 years . Another factor that could be responsible for such a contradiction is that 9 out of 11 patients who reported having underlying conditions according to Abdollahi , [ 24 ] have severe medical conditions . They concluded that self - col - lection is not recommended for patients with severe medical conditions . In our study , 47 . 7 % of the participants were asymptomatic with the remaining showing mild to moderate symptoms , this could be another factor that contributed to the high sensitivity and specific - ity rate of self - collected samples . In another study by seaman [ 25 ] a meta - analysis was carried out on fourteen papers that focused on the effectiveness of self - sample collection compared with professional - swabbing in the diagnosis of influenza in symptomatic individuals . The sampling technique required for influenza and that for SARS - COV - 2 are similar with both requiring specimens using nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabbing as well as a nasopharyngeal wash which is not so common in SARS - COV - 2 detection . They found out that self - sampling was highly acceptable , simple , and comfortable , and that self - sample collection findings may be affected slightly by measurement errors . The pooled sensitivity of 87 % and specificity of 99 % were reported from nine studies . Hence reports from these studies were in concor - dance with our work which showed that self - sampling is a reliable method of sample collec - tion for COVID - 19 . Dennis McCulloch [ 26 ] in a study that recruited 185 participants who carried out self - swab - bing at home , unsupervised showed a sensitivity of 80 % and a specificity of 97 . 9 % which is similar to what has been obtained in our study . However , the majority ( 158 ) of their study par - ticipants were health care workers from drive - through clinics with fourteen of them eventually testing positive . Our study excluded health workers so as not to create a bias in sample collec - tion based on technical know - how . The results of the interrater analysis which is Kappa = 0 . 800 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 690 to 0 . 910 ) implies an outstanding agreement between the two COVID - 19 sampling methods . Furthermore , since p < 0 . 001 Kappa ( k ) coefficient is statisti - cally different from zero , our findings have shown that self - collected samples can be reliable in the diagnosis of COVID - 19 . It is important to ascertain the reliability of samples collected by untrained individuals as the majority of those who would be involved would have little or no skill in self - sample collec - tion . This is to make sure that samples collected individually would produce the same results as the ones collected by professionals .

This study eluci - dates that self - sample collection can indeed be reliable and should be encouraged as a means to expand testing for COVID - 19 . Limitation of study Poor internet connection limited the extensive use of telemonitoring system , as some partici - pants had issues with connection , hence not being able be assessed by the health professionals who are off site . However , health professionals on site were available to carry out monitoring in such cases . Recommendation We recommend that testing centers implement this strategy so as to reduce waiting time dur - ing sample collection and also reduce contact with healthcare professionals . This would help curb the transmission of this virus from patient to healthcare worker and enable a more rapid sample collection process . This sample collection method can be used at home or in offices , for people who are unable to make it to testing centers and need to have their samples collected . This can be achieved by simply sending the sample collection kits to them and return to the testing laboratory through a courier service .
