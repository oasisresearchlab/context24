Using representative samples of the general population , we evaluated retrospective mortality and seroprevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in Lubumbashi and Abidjan . The studies included retrospective mortality surveys and nested anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibody prevalence surveys . In Lubumbashi the study took place during April - May 2021 and in Abi - djan the survey was implemented in two phases : July - August 2021 and October - November 2021 . Crude mortality rates were stratified between pre - pandemic and pandemic periods and further investigated by age group and COVID waves . Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 seropreva - lence was quantified by rapid diagnostic testing ( RDT ) and laboratory - based testing ( ELISA in Lubumbashi and ECLIA in Abidjan ) . In Lubumbashi , the crude mortality rate ( CMR ) increased from 0 . 08 deaths per 10 000 persons per day ( pre - pandemic ) to 0 . 20 deaths per 10 000 persons per day ( pandemic period ) . Increases were particularly pronounced among < 5 years old . In Abidjan , no overall increase was observed during the pandemic period ( pre - pandemic : 0 . 05 deaths per 10 000 persons per day ; pandemic : 0 . 07 deaths per 10 000 per - sons per day ) . However , an increase was observed during the third wave ( 0 . 11 deaths per 10 000 persons per day ) . The estimated seroprevalence in Lubumbashi was 15 . 7 % ( RDT ) and 43 . 2 % ( laboratory - based ) . In Abidjan , the estimated seroprevalence was 17 . 4 % ( RDT ) and 72 . 9 % ( laboratory - based ) during the first phase of the survey and 38 . 8 % ( RDT ) and 82 . 2 % ( laboratory - based ) during the second phase of the survey .

Data Availability Statement : The minimal dataset underlyingthe findingsof this study is available on SARS - CoV - 2 seems to have been extensive in both settings , the public health impact var - ied . The increases , particularly among the youngest age group , suggest indirect impacts of COVID and the pandemic on population health . The seroprevalence results confirmed sub - stantial underdetection of cases through the national surveillance systems . Introduction Official surveillance data from African countries suggest that the public health impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) associated with coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) is less than that observed in Asia , America , and Europe [ 1 ] . Several fac - tors , including the younger population , early government actions , lower prevalence of comor - bidities , cross - immunity , environmental factors and surveillance , have been noted as possible explanations for the lower mortality observed in most African countries [ 2 ] . While seropreva - lence studies have been conducted in several African countries indicating widespread circula - tion of the virus in contrast to often low surveillance figures , few population - based mortality studies have been conducted to measure the impact of this high virus circulation [ 3 ] . Here we studied the public health impact of SARS - CoV - 2 in two African countries with low numbers of reported COVID - 19 associated deaths , the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) and Coˆte d’Ivoire . The first COVID - 19 cases were reported nearly simultaneously in the two countries , on 10 March 2020 in the DRC and on the following day in Coˆte d’Ivoire . After the first wave , a seroprevalence of 16 . 6 % among the general population was observed in Kinshasa , the capital city of the DRC [ 4 ] , and 25 . 1 % among gold mine workers in Coˆte d’Ivoire [ 5 ] . Coˆte d’Ivoire was among the first African countries to receive COVID - 19 vaccines with vaccination campaigns starting in March 2021 . In the DRC , COVID vaccination campaigns began in April 2021 , but were temporarily suspended shortly afterwards . In Lubumbashi , the studied area in the DRC , vaccinations began in May 2022 . As of the start of the respective sur - veys ( 12 April 2021 in DRC and 15 July 2021 in Coˆte d’Ivoire ) , 28 , 542 cases and 745 deaths had been reported in the DRC and 48 , 999 cases and 319 deaths reported in Coˆte d’Ivoire [ 6 ] . To quantify the extent of SARS - COV - 2 infections and to detect potential increases in the crude mortality rate ( CMR ) during the SARS - COV - 2 pandemic phase , we assessed seropreva - lence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies and retrospective mortality in a representative sample of the general population in three health zones of Lubumbashi , DRC and two communes of Abi - djan , Coˆte d’Ivoire more than one year after the first confirmed cases of COVID - 19 in these settings . Methods We conducted two cross - sectional household - based surveys in the cities of Lubumbashi ( DRC ) and Abidjan ( Coˆte d’Ivoire ) . The survey in Lubumbashi took place in the health zones Lubumbashi ( stratum 1 ) and Kampemba / Tshamilemba ( stratum 2 ) , which were chosen based on COVID incidence in the initial months and increased reporting of deaths through cemetery surveillance , respectively . In Abidjan , the survey was implemented in the communes of Marc - ory ( stratum 1 ) and Yopougon ( stratum 2 ) . These urban areas were chosen because , while the prevalence of poverty is higher in Yopougon than Marcory [ 7 ] , Yopougon had a much lower COVID - 19 attack rate than Marcory according to available surveillance data [ 8 ] . The studies each included a retrospective mortality survey using a two - stage cluster sam - pling methodology and a nested SARS - CoV - 2 antibody prevalence survey .

( Lubumbashi ) and 640 clusters ( Abidjan ) were first randomly selected based on spatial sam - pling and subsequently 5 randomly selected households per cluster were included in the mor - tality survey and 1 household per cluster in the seroprevalence survey . A detailed description of the study design and sampling methodology is provided in S1 Text . The mortality question - naire consisted of sections covering housing characteristics , demographic data , and informa - tion on deaths ( including the date of death ) that occurred during the recall period . For households included in the seroprevalence survey , individual questionnaires were adminis - tered to each household member or their parent / guardian covering socio - demographic infor - mation , medical history , potential SARS - CoV - 2 exposures , history of any possible COVID - related symptoms since 2020 and COVID - 19 vaccination status . Generic questionnaire tools that were slightly adapted to study settings are provided in S2 Text . All members of households included in the seroprevalence survey were asked to provide a blood sample , either in the form of dried blood spots using finger or heel pricks ( participants of all ages in Lubumbashi and children less than 5 years old in Abidjan ) or in the form of venous blood ( participants 5 years and older in Abidjan ) . In both sites , serological testing was done using a rapid serological test ( BIOSYNEX 1 COVID - 19 BSS ( IgG / IgM ) ( Biosynex SA , Switzerland ) . The Biosynex test has shown good performance ( sensitivity : 95 . 8 % [ 95 % CI 90 . 2 − 100 . 0 ] , specificity : 98 . 1 % [ 95 % CI 94 . 3 – 100 . 0 ] ) ) [ 9 ] . Additional laboratory - based testing was conducted using the EUROIMMUN Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( EUROIMMUN Medizinische Labor diagnostika AG , Lu¨beck , Germany ) at the INRB labora - tory in Lubumbashi or the Roche Elecsys anti - SARS - CoV - 2 S immunoassay ( Roche Diagnos - tics , Rotkreuz , Switzerland ) at the Institut Pasteur Coˆte d’Ivoire in Abidjan . Initial laboratory evaluations of the EUROIMMUN test showed a sensitivity of 90 % [ 95 % CI 74 . 4 – 96 . 5 ] and a specificity of 100 % [ 95 % CI 95 . 4 – 100 ] [ 10 ] . Initial evaluation of the Roche assay found a sensi - tivity of 98 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 98 . 1 – 99 . 3 % ) among patients for 14 days or later after diagnosis with PCR and a specificity of 100 % ( 95 % CI : 99 . 7 – 100 % ) and was selected in part due to its strong performance detecting antibodies even several months after infection [ 11 , 12 ] . Crude mortality rates ( CMR , expressed as deaths / 10 , 000 people / day ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI ) were calculated taking into account the study design using the survey pack - age in R . The analysis was stratified between pre - pandemic and pandemic time periods . In Lubumbashi the pre - pandemic period was defined as 1 January 2020 – 12 April 2020 and the pandemic period as 13 April 2020 – date of survey . In Abidjan , the pre - pandemic period was defined as 1 January 2019 – 12 April 2020 and the pandemic period as 13 April 2020 – date of survey . 12 April 2020 was chosen as cut - off date between the pre - pandemic and pandemic period as it was the Easter Sunday , a date easy to recall for survey participants . Differences in mortality rates were further investigated by time periods corresponding approximately to indi - vidual COVID - 19 waves ( Lubumbashi Wave 1 : 13 April 2020 – 31 August 2020 and Wave 2 : 1 November 2020 – date of survey ; Abidjan Wave 1 : 13 April 2020 – & August 2020 , Wave 2 : 1 January 2021 – 30 June 2021 and Wave 3 : 1 July 2021 – date of survey ) . Deaths were attributed to the time periods based on their date of death . To quantify differences of the mortality rates between the pre - pandemic and pandemic periods , we estimated rate ratios with 95 % CIs using a Poisson generalized linear model ( GLM ) with log - transformed follow - up time as offset in the survey package in R and tested for statistical significance of differences using Wald - test . For the estimation of seroprevalence , a positive rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) result was defined as positive IgM , positive IgG or positive IgM and IgG . A positive ELISA / ECLIA result was defined using the manufacturer - specified cut - off value ( Euroimmun ELISA : optical den - sity ratio � 1 . 1 ; Roche ECLIA : titer � 0 . 8 U / mL ) . Seroprevalence and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI ) were estimated using the survey package in R , weighting for demographic differences between the survey sample and the general population and adjusting for the design effect .

Adults 18 years and older were eligible for vaccination dur - ing study implementation . Vaccines became available in Lubumbashi after the completion of the study . To compare seroprevalence among sub - groups ( sex , age groups , strata ) , we esti - mated odds ratios ( OR ) and 95 % CIs and tested for statistical differences using Wald test in a logistic regression model considering the study design using the survey package in R . The proportion of symptomatic and proportion of vaccinated individuals , together with 95 % CIs , were estimated using the same statistical procedure as for seroprevalence estimates . Differences in other characteristics between time periods ( symptoms , comorbidities – mea - sured in proportions ) were evaluated based on Fisher’s exact test . We further investigated socioeconomic risk factors ( household type , presence of latrines , and number of people per room ) for a household reporting a death using a GLM logistic regression model at the household level . To investigate if seropositivity was associated with the presence of another seropositive household member , we implemented a GLM logistic regres - sion model at individual level using the survey package taking the survey design into account . Ethics statement The study in Lubumbashi has been approved by the Comite´ d’Etique Medicale of the Univer - sity of Lubumbashi ( ID UNILU / CEM / 020 / 2020 ) and the study in Abidjan by the Comite´ National d’Etique des Sciences de la Vie et de la Sante´ ( ID 054 - 21 / MSHP / CNESVS - km ) . Both studies have been approved by the MSF ERB ( ID 2089b , 2089d ) . Formal written consent was obtained from all participants 18 years or older . For participants less than 18 years , written consent was obtained from the parent / guardian ; additional assent was obtained from partici - pants aged 8 – 17 years in Lubumbashi and 9 – 17 years in Abidjan . Results Study population In Lubumbashi , the mortality and seroprevalence surveys took place concurrently 12 April – 18 May 2021 , at the end of the second SARS - CoV - 2 wave ( Fig 1A ) . A total of 3 , 506 households , including 19 , 694 household members , participated in the mortality survey . The median age of participants was 18 years ( interquartile range [ IQR ] 7 – 32 ) and 49 . 6 % were male . A total of 2 , 038 individuals from 650 households participated in the RDT - based serosurvey . Participants had a median age of 22 years ( IQR 10 – 36 ) and 44 . 6 % were male . Both diagnostic type results , RDT and ELISA , were available for 1 , 897 individuals . In Abidjan , the surveys took place during two phases due to extenuating circumstances dur - ing data collection : 15 July – 14 August 2021 ( after the second wave and during the beginning of the third wave ) & 20 October – 10 November 2021 ( end of and after the third wave ) ( Fig 1B ) . A total of 3 , 180 households , including 15 , 454 household members , participated in the mortality survey . The median age of participants was 25 years ( IQR 13 – 39 ) and 44 . 3 % were male . A total of 1 , 862 individuals from 634 households participated in the RDT - based serosur - vey . Participants had a median age of 32 years ( IQR 19 – 44 ) and 36 . 6 % were male . Both diag - nostic type results , RDT and ECLIA , were available for 1 , 800 individuals . The proportion of visited households that did not participate in the mortality survey due to refusal or absence of the household head was 11 . 7 % in Lubumbashi and 21 . 6 % in Abidjan . Non - participation of households was much higher in the serosurvey ( 61 . 2 % Lubumbashi , 61 . 7 % Abidjan ) . Additionally , individual refusals in households that participated in the sero - survey was high at 45 % in both settings .

The median age of reported deaths was 25 years ( IQR 3 – 57 ) in Lubumbashi and 54 years ( IQR 30 – 70 ) in Abidjan ; 52 . 0 % and 65 . 1 % were male , respectively . Fever / malaria was one of the main reported causes of death in both settings ( Lubumbashi 34 . 0 % , Abidjan 24 . 1 % ) ; respiratory diseases other than COVID - 19 were indicated as the cause for 6 . 7 % of deaths in Lubumbashi and 9 . 6 % in Abidjan . Two deaths were attributed to COVID - 19 in Lubumbashi , however occurred in the pre - pandemic period and are likely mis - classifications . In Abidjan no COVID - 19 deaths were reported . The main reported causes of death did not change significantly between the pre - pandemic and pandemic period in either of the settings ( Table A in S1 Text and Table B in S1 Text ) . In Lubumbashi the overall CMR increased significantly from a pre - pandemic rate of 0 . 08 deaths per 10 000 persons per day ( 95 % CI 0 . 05 – 0 . 14 ) to a pandemic rate of 0 . 20 deaths per 10 000 persons per day ( 95 % CI 0 . 17 – 0 . 25 ) ( Rate ratio [ RR ] = 2 . 5 [ 95 % CI 1 . 4 – 4 . 3 ] ; p = 0 . 001 ) ( Fig 2C ) . The increase was statistically significant only among under 5 - year - olds , however not among the other age groups ( Fig 2D , Table C in S1 Text ) . In Abidjan no significant increase in the CMR was observed overall ( pre - pandemic 0 . 05 deaths per 10 000 persons per day [ 95 % CI 0 . 03 – 0 . 07 ] , pandemic 0 . 07 deaths per 10 000 persons per day [ 95 % CI 0 . 05 – 0 . 09 ] ; RR 1 . 5 [ 95 % CI 0 . 9 – 2 . 5 ] , p = 0 . 099 ) ( Fig 2C ) or by age group ( Fig 2D , Table D in S1 Text ) . The increase in CMR varied by SARS - CoV2 waves . In Lubumbashi , compared to the baseline period , the increase was statistically significant during the second wave ( CMR wave 2 : 0 . 29 deaths per 10 000 persons per day [ 95 % CI 0 . 23 – 0 . 37 ] ; RR 3 . 5 [ 95 % CI 2 . 0 – 6 . 1 ] , p < 0 . 001 ) but not during the first wave ( CMR wave 1 : 0 . 12 deaths per 10 000 persons per day [ 95 % CI 0 . 09 – 0 . 18 ] ; RR 1 . 5 [ 95 % CI 0 . 8 – 2 . 9 ] , p = 0 . 216 ) ( Fig 2C , Table E in S1 Text ) .

We performed a sensitivity analysis to investigate if observed increases during the pandemic period in Lubumbashi and the 3 rd wave in Abidjan may have been caused by seasonal effects . The results of the sensitivity analysis showed consistent results with the main analysis ( Table G in S1 Text and Table H in S1 Text ) . Geographical differences in CMR were observed in Lubumbashi , where the health zones of Kampemba / Tshamilemba were more affected by the increase than the health zone of Lubum - bashi ( Table I in S1 Text ) . In Abidjan , the pattern was homogeneous across the two health zones ( Table J in S1 Text ) . The risk of reporting a death in a household was associated with crowded living conditions ; after adjusting for household size , households with an average of more than 1 – 2 household members per room ( Lubumbashi OR 5 . 6 [ 95 % CI 2 . 4 – 13 . 2 ] ; Abidjan OR 8 . 1 [ 95 % CI 1 . 1 – 61 . 0 ] ) and households with more than 2 household members per room ( Lubumbashi OR 8 . 1 [ 95 % CI 3 . 2 – 20 . 5 ] ; Abidjan OR 7 . 6 [ 95 % CI 1 . 0 – 58 . 2 ] ) were more likely to report a death than households with � 1 household members per room . Moreover , in Abidjan the risk of reporting a death was higher among households living in a house with common courtyard than living in an individual house ( OR 2 . 1 [ 95 % CI 1 . 2 – 3 . 8 ] ) ( Table K in S1 Text and Table L in S1 Text ) . Seroprevalence survey In Lubumbashi , 320 / 2038 participants were found seropositive by RDT , resulting in a weighted seroprevalence of 15 . 7 % ( 95 % CI 13 . 6 – 18 . 1 ) after the 2 nd wave . In Abidjan , 445 / 1471 of unvaccinated participants had a positive RDT result . The weighted seroprevalence among unvaccinated doubled from 17 . 4 % ( 95 % CI 13 . 3 – 22 . 1 ) during phase 1 ( after the 2 nd wave ) to 38 . 8 % ( 95 % CI 43 . 1 – 43 . 7 ) during phase 2 of the survey ( after the 3 rd wave ) . ELISA / ECLIA seroprevalence was 1 . 8 – 3 . 4 times higher than based on RDT , with a weighted seroprevalence of 43 . 2 % ( 95 % CI 40 . 0 – 46 . 4 ) in Lubumbashi and 72 . 9 % ( 95 % CI 67 . 3 – 78 . 0 ) and 82 . 2 % ( 95 % CI 78 . 0 – 85 . 9 ) in phase 1 and 2 in Abidjan , respectively . A detailed com - parison of RDT and ELISA results is provided in the Supplementary material ( Table M in S1 Text and Table N in S1 Text ) . In Lubumbashi , seroprevalence was highest among 50 + year - olds ( RDT : 26 . 6 % [ 95 % CI 19 . 5 – 34 . 6 ] ; ELISA : 52 . 4 % [ 95 % CI 43 . 5 – 61 . 2 ] ) and lowest among 20 – 34 - year - olds ( RDT : 13 . 1 % [ 95 % CI 9 . 6 – 17 . 2 ] ; ELISA : 40 . 8 % [ 95 % CI 35 . 2 – 46 . 5 ] ) ( Fig 3 ) . The age pattern followed a similar tendency in Abidjan based on RDT for both phases of the survey , however the pattern was slightly different based on ECLIA ( Fig 3 ) . Geographic differences were found in Lubumbashi based on RDT results , where seropreva - lence was higher in Kampemba / Tshamilemba health zones than in Lubumbashi health zone ; no difference was however observed based on ELISA results ( Table O in S1 Text ) . In Abidjan , after considering the phase of the survey , no significant differences were observed between strata based on RDT or ECLIA results . The direction of differences between strata however varied by survey phase ( Table P in S1 Text ) . In both settings , and for both types of tests , the risk of being seropositive was higher in households with at least one other seropositive member compared with households with no other seropositive household member ( Lubumbashi : OR 3 . 1 [ 95 % CI 1 . 5 – 6 . 4 ] ; Abidjan : OR 3 . 3 [ 95 % CI 2 . 53 – 4 . 21 ] ) . However , the risk of having a deceased household member was not higher in households with one or more seropositive individuals ( Lubumbashi OR 0 . 9 [ 95 % CI 0 . 4 – 2 . 4 ] ; Abidjan : OR 1 . 08 [ 95 % CI 0 . 3 – 3 . 87 ] ) .

This proportion was similar among ELISA / ECLIA positive individuals ( Lubumbashi 19 . 0 % [ 95 % CI 15 . 2 – 23 . 3 ] ; Abidjan 71 . 8 % [ 95 % CI 65 . 7 – 77 . 4 ] ) . We did not find significant positive associations of seropositivity and work related or social contact related exposures ( Table Q in S1 Text and Table R in S1 Text ) . COVID - 19 vaccination In Lubumbashi , the survey took place before the roll - out of COVID - 19 vaccination . In Abi - djan , the weighted proportion of vaccinated individuals nearly doubled from 9 . 0 % ( 95 % CI 6 . 5 – 11 . 9 ) during the first phase of the survey to 16 . 8 % ( 95 % CI 13 . 8 – 20 . 2 ) during the second phase of the survey . Vaccination rates increased with age ; 31 . 7 % ( 95 % CI % : 25 . 1 – 38 . 8 ) of those aged 50 + years reported having been vaccinated . While women ( 11 . 9 % [ 95 % CI % : 8 . 1 – 16 . 5 ] ) had a higher vaccination rate than men ( 5 . 6 % [ 95CI % 3 . 6 – 8 . 2 ] ) in the first phase , no difference was observed in the second phase . Among the vaccinated individuals , 89 . 3 % had a positive RDT and 97 . 7 % a positive ECLIA result . Discussion We present here two of the first COVID - 19 studies that combine mortality and seroprevalence surveys , providing mortality estimates and seroprevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in a representative sample of the general population after the second pandemic wave in Lubumba - shi , before the spread of the Delta variant , and during and after the third pandemic wave in Abidjan during which the Delta variant circulated [ 13 , 14 ] . In Lubumbashi , the CMR overall doubled during the pandemic period compared to the pre - pandemic period , with a more pro - nounced increase during the second wave . Most affected were the < 5 year - olds , suggesting that the increase in mortality may have , in addition to the pandemic , been driven by factors indirectly impacted by the pandemic such as delayed or decreased access to healthcare due to fear of contracting COVID - 19 , reduced health system capacity , disruption in service provision , transport restrictions or economic challenges [ 15 , 16 ] . In Abidjan , there was no significant increase in crude mortality rates between the pre - pandemic and pandemic phase . However , an increase was observed during the 3rd wave of COVID - 19 , consistent with the increase in deaths reported by the official COVID - 19 surveillance system compared to previous waves . Fig 3 . RDT and ELISA / ECLIA based seroprevalence by age group in Lubumbashi ( A ) and Abidjan for phase 1 ( B ) and phase 2 ( C ) of the survey . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pgph . 0001457 . g003 PLOS GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalenceand retrospective mortality in Lubumbashi and Abidjan PLOS Global PublicHealth | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pgph . 0001457 June 8 , 2023 8 / 12 Overall , the increases in mortality observed in both studies were low , especially when com - pared to the excess mortality observed in areas of Europe , Asia and the Americas [ 17 – 19 ] . Our results indicate that a large proportion , if not the majority , of the population has anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in both settings . According to the laboratory - based results , more than 40 % of the population was infected with SARS - CoV - 2 during the first two waves in Lubumba - shi and more than 80 % during the first 3 waves in Abidjan . Our findings are similar to more recent seroprevalence studies in several African countries which indicate that , while heteroge - nous , the virus has circulated widely [ 3 ] . We found that seroprevalence increased with age , contrary to observations in European countries [ 20 – 22 ] , but similar to other seroprevalence surveys in Africa [ 3 ] . The infection risk in the African context thus appears to be higher in the elderly population , who also have a higher risk of severe disease . The estimated infection rates were tens ( in Abidjan ) to hundreds ( Lubumbashi ) times higher than confirmed cases in the surveillance system of both countries . Our seroprevalence results in Abidjan show similar spread in Yopougon as in Marcory , in contrast to surveillance system figures which indicated a much lower attack rate in Yopougon . In Abidjan , based on the ECLIA results from the 2 nd phase and official notified cases , we estimated 1 in 31 infections were reported in Marcory and only 1 in 151 in Yopougon . In Lubumbashi , only 1 in 150 infec - tions were reported in the Lubumbashi health zone and only 1 in 700 infections were reported in Kampemba and Tshamilemba health zones . These results are consistent with a previous seroprevalence study in Kinshasa ( DRC ) , which estimated after the 1 st wave that only 1 in 300 infections were reported [ 4 ] . Our studies had several limitations . First the refusal rate was high in both contexts , particu - larly for the seroprevalence survey , suggesting a risk of selection bias . The median age of par - ticipants was higher in the seroprevalence than mortality survey , suggesting that young individuals may have been more likely to refuse . The lengthy recall period may have biased the accuracy of the collected death information , particularly for deaths that occurred earlier in the period , and in some cases , deaths may have been missed or household members may have been omitted . COVID - related stigma may have resulted in underreporting of COVID - related deaths , as no death was directly attributed to COVID - 19 in either study . Moreover , we were not able to adjust for potential remaining confounding such as seasonality of other circulating pathogens . A sensitivity analyses restricting the analysis to the same months during the pre - pandemic and the pandemic phase showed however consistent results . The performance of ELISA / ECLIA and RDT are significantly different , with ELISA / ECLIA - based seroprevalence estimates 3 times higher than those estimated by RDT . Similar disparities have been observed in other seroprevalence studies [ 23 , 24 ] . Test performance varies with time since infection and severity of infection , and RDT sensitivity may be lower to detect infections that occurred early during the epidemic resulting in lower seroprevalence estimates [ 11 , 25 ] . One study observed 91 . 3 % and 83 . 7 % of COVID - 19 positive healthcare workers tested positive for IgM and IgG , respectively , with Biosynex RDT one month after infection versus 51 . 8 % IgM and 56 . 8 % IgG at months 11 – 13 [ 26 ] . Another longitudinal study among public health workers found Euroimmun ELISA responses increased in the first month and then decreased for several weeks , with predicted proportion of sero - reverting of 59 % after 12 months while Roche ECLIA responses increased , with no sero - reversions at week 24 and pre - dicted sero - reverting of < 2 % at 12 months [ 27 ] . False - positive results due to cross - reactivity cannot be entirely excluded [ 28 ] . Additionally , symptoms experienced more than a year ago may be difficult to recall and are not specific , making accurate estimation of symptomatic infections not possible . To limit bias , participants were asked about their symptoms before they knew their RDT result .

Nevertheless , the sero - prevalence is comparably high among the non - vaccinated and total study population . Lastly it is unclear to what extent SARS - CoV - 2 cross - reactive antibodies provide protection against future SARS - CoV - 2 infection or disease progression , particularly in the event of new variants . The results of this analysis predate the third wave of cases in Lubumbashi and subse - quent waves in Abidjan . Despite these limitations , our study provides key results estimating the extent of SARS - CoV - 2 infections in two urban African contexts and additionally the impact of infections on mortality . Conclusion Although circulation of SARS - CoV - 2 seems to have been wide in both study settings , the pub - lic health impact of COVID - 19 varied by setting and seems to have been overall low compared to Europe , Asia or the Americas . The results in Lubumbashi , with increases particularly among the youngest age group , suggest indirect impacts of COVID and the pandemic on pop - ulation health . The seroprevalence results confirmed substantial underdetection of cases through the national surveillance systems and demonstrated an increased risk of infection among the oldest age group , who are also at risk of more severe disease progression . Lastly , due to the high overall spread of the virus , our results suggest that targeted vaccination cam - paigns are appropriate to protect higher risk populations . Supporting information S1 Text .
