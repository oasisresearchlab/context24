1 Primer Clathrin Couture : Fashioning Distinctive Membrane Coats at the Cell Surface Linton M . Traub * Department of Cell Biology and Physiology , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States of America Eukaryotic cells utilize intricate mechanisms for the uptake and intracellular sorting of various macromolecules , such as membrane components and extracellular proteins . Microscopic imaging studies have helped considerably to describe and define important steps of the uptake process . It has been shown that the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane is studded with small , domed assemblages of peripheral membrane proteins . These constitute transitory sorting stations that dynamically remodel the compo - sition of the cell surface in response to both intracellular and extracellular stimuli . Typically , within a minute of forming , these assemblages invaginate to generate ‘‘buds’’ that then detach , generating small ( , 60 nm ) , membrane - bound transport vesicles that deliver their contents ( often receptors ) to specific intracellular compartments—namely acceptor early endosomes—for further dissemination within the cell ( Figure 1 ) . This invagination and sorting process is called endocytosis , and although several morphologically and structurally distinct endocytic sorting assem - blies occur at the surface of most cells [ 1 ] , perhaps the most recognizable are polyhedral clathrin - coated structures . First identified to be cargo - selective transport carriers during yolk uptake and storage within oocytes of blood - fed mosquitoes [ 2 ] , clathrin - coated vesicles are now known to support many vital cellular processes , ranging from nutrient uptake , cellular locomo - tion , and transcriptional regulation and proliferation to complex developmental morphogenetic events . Clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis also seems important for the efficacy of anti - receptor monoclonal antibody - based tumor therapy [ 3 ] and for suscepti - bility to double - stranded RNA – mediated gene silencing [ 4 ] . The Mysteries of Clathrin - Coated Structure Initiation and Function Clathrin assembles at discrete patches on the plasma membrane through cooperative interactions involving a large set of endocytic proteins [ 5 ] . Chief among these are adaptor proteins , which , as the name suggests , link membrane components with the outer layer of the vesicle coat , which is composed of clathrin trimers ( Figure 1 , inset ) . While the principal role of clathrin - coated buds is to gather appropriate transmembrane proteins , generically designated ‘‘cargo , ’’ for selective delivery to the cell interior , cargo capture is not the driving force for the deposition of coat components at a nascent bud site . AP - 2 , a major adaptor complex within clathrin - coated structures , has two separate cargo - binding surfaces that are probably both inaccessible when AP - 2 first docks onto the plasma membrane [ 6 , 7 ] . This means that although cargo depends on a sorting signal ( s ) for its incorporation into clathrin - coated vesicles , recognition of these signals is unlikely to be the event that recruits adaptors and thus allows clathrin coats to form on bare membrane . Instead , the rare and spatially restricted phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) seems to play a major role in placing coat protomers on the plasma membrane to begin clathrin assembly [ 8 – 11 ] ; AP - 2 and several other important coat and accessory proteins bind physically to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ 5 ] . Perturbing PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production in cultured cells leads to an almost immediate dissolution of preexisting clathrin - coated structures at the cell surface [ 8 , 10 , 11 ] . Because transmission electron microscope ( EM ) images typically reveal isolated , invaginating coated buds all along the cell surface , and clathrin immunolabeling often shows a profusion of small , separated puncta apparently randomly scattered over the surface membrane ( Figure 2 ) , it seems reasonable to suspect that clathrin - coated vesicles might form de novo for each internalization cycle . There is indeed evidence for this from live - cell imaging . In the unicellular yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the predictable kinetic behavior of coat components has led to a thorough cataloging of temporally resolved protein entry and exit at single - turnover endocytic sites [ 12 ] . In BS - C - 1 cells , an African green monkey – derived cell line , clathrin coats at the surface are similarly uniform . The stereotyped behavior of these structures has allowed the definition of coat lifetimes and revealed different types of failure events [ 13 , 14 ] for these canonical constructions , which are known as clathrin - coated pits . Most importantly , insufficient ( or perhaps inappropriate ) cargo packaging appears to presage nonproductive collapse of an incipient bud [ 13 , 14 ] . So , while cargo clearly does not actively recruit coat machinery to the membrane , it plays an important role in driving the process forward to the next step : the budding of vesicles . Yet , in other cell lines [ 15 – 19 ] and isolated primary cells [ 20 ] , the size distribution of clathrin - coated structures on the cell surface is far less regular than in BS - C - 1 cells . For example , in HeLa cells , in addition to transient diffraction - limited objects ( , 200 nm ) , large , long - lived and rather sedentary clathrin spots ( . 500 nm ) are observed ( Figure 2 ) . Both EM [ 21 , 22 ] and time - resolved fluorescence imaging techniques , like total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIR - FM ) [ 17 , 18 , 23 , 24 ] , have been used to visualize the bulky clathrin structures on the basal adherent surface , but EM - based visualization of isolated dorsal plasma Citation : Traub LM ( 2009 ) Clathrin Couture : Fashioning Distinctive Membrane Coats at the Cell Surface .

PLoS Biology | www . plosbiology . org 1 September 2009 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e1000192 membrane also shows regions of extensive flat clathrin lattice [ 25 , 26 ] . Why are there different clathrin assemblies at the plasma membrane and what , if any , is the functional significance of this dichotomy ? The variability in position , size , and dynamic behavior of diverse clathrin structures has made global computational analysis of large data sets of time - resolved events very challenging . For one thing , the kinetic inconsistency makes modeling difficult and much depends upon whether , despite morphological and temporal plasticity , the sorting and functional properties of the different patches is basically the same . Clathrin - Coated Pits versus Clathrin - Coated Plaques In this issue of PLoS Biology , the Kirchhausen laboratory delves into this issue by utilizing quantitative live - cell imaging of several Figure 1 . Clathrin - regulated uptake and the endocytic pathway . Schematic illustration of a cultured cell showing surface - positioned clathrin - coated buds , ventrally located large , flat clathrin ‘‘plaques , ’’ and the major internal endosomal sorting stations . After clathrin coat uncoating , transport vesicles quickly fuse with the peripheral early endosome compartment , mingling incoming cargo molecules in this initial sorting endosome . Transmembrane cargo can return either directly to the plasma membrane from the early endosome , or be sorted into tubules that are delivered to the juxtanuclear recycling endosome compartment , from which cargo can also be directed back to the cell surface . The bulbous vacuolar portion of the early endosome , containing a flat , bilayered clathrin coat , matures into a multivesicular body for delivery of selected components to lysosomes for degradation . The inset shows the basic composition and organization of a clathrin - coated vesicle , with the three major layers : the inner membrane vesicle with various embedded transmembrane cargo ( blue and green ) , an intermediate layer of adaptors including AP - 2 ( gray ) , and the outer clathrin polyhedral lattice ( red ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pbio . 1000192 . g001 Figure 2 .

Their overarching conclusion is that two mechanistically distinct modes of clathrin assembly and internal - ization occur at the ventral plasma membrane of different cells . They deduce that rounded buds correspond to de novo – forming , canonical clathrin - coated pits on naked membrane , while clathrin - coated ‘‘plaques’’ are equivalent to the persistent , flat clathrin sheets , and are found only on the basal adherent surface . A pivotal finding is that plaques apparently remain roughly planar throughout , including when an abrupt inward trajectory signifies entry into the cell interior . In curved coated pits , the distribution of AP - 2 and epsin , another adaptor , relative to the clathrin coat appears asymmetric , but not in plaques [ 27 ] . This again suggests that the underlying plasma membrane is not deformed into a spherical vesicle , typical of most coat - mediated transport events ; plaques seemingly maintain a constant arrangement throughout their functional lifetime . Saffarian et al . provocatively argue that their characterization of general plaque behavior rationalizes a rather discrepant literature , yet the work also raises several fundamental questions . Foremost is whether the plaques they catalog are generally equivalent to the extensive , long - lived , and immobile clathrin patches seen by others . In contrasting ultrastructural studies from other laborato - ries , the flat patches can be considerably larger [ 21 , 25 , 26 , 28 , 29 ] , and internalization en masse could possibly generate a large puncture in the basal membrane unless much circumferential uncoated membrane is also incorporated into the incoming vesicle , with concomitant reorganization of the underlying surface bilayer ( Figure 3 ) . Do plaques invariably enter as intact structures ? And , if so , how mechanistically does this occur without compromising the bulk membrane structure ? Curiously , despite being plentiful at the adherent surface , thin - section EM images of plaques captured precisely at the instant of internalization are not available . Saffarian et al . assert that the slow relative rate of plaque internalization makes this visualization unlikely . Still , a striking feature of clathrin structures in freeze - etch images of the adherent cell surface is the frequent close proximity of emerging rounded buds to adjacent flat arrays ( Figure 2 ) . Corroborating thin - section EM images have been published previously in which buds within , or immediately adjacent to , plaques are plainly seen [ 21 ] . One interpretation of this juxtaposed positioning is that flat clathrin arrays could operate as staging scaffolds for spherical bud production . This idea is in accord with observed fluctuations in TIR - FM fluorescence intensity within the persistent lattice population [ 20 ] , which are compatible with loss of ( peripheral ) subregions of an extended patch , leaving portions remaining at the plasma membrane [ 15 ] . Labeled cargo molecules also have been seen emerging from stationary clathrin patches [ 20 , 26 ] . Next , we do not understand clearly how , when compared with pits , flat arrays are differentially nucleated and apparently restricted to the adherent surface of the cell . The requirement for a very large excess of hexagonal facets to construct a planar lattice differs obviously from de novo – nucleated buds . Yet , flat lattices must require PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 for assembly , as consumption of this lipid leads to prompt loss of most clathrin structures and adaptors at the ventral surface [ 10 , 11 ] . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments indicate that during assem - bly , clathrin and AP - 2 molecules rapidly enter and exit small and large structures alike [ 16 , 30 ] . That both structures are dynamic at the microscopic level suggests similar overall apparatus and assembly mechanisms . And if cargo is needed to stabilize coats [ 13 , 14 ] , then long - lived plaques must contain and sequester cargo , just as pits do . This is borne out experimentally : fluorescently tagged transferrin ( a serum iron transporter that engages the transmembrane transferrin receptor for clathrin - dependent import of iron into the cell interior ) labels essentially all surface clathrin structures in HeLa and other cells [ 17 , 19 , 20 , 30 ] . The density of transferrin receptor in flat lattice is proportional to receptor concentration [ 26 ] , and the rate and quantitative nature of transferrin uptake makes it highly unlikely that cargo concentrated within plaques fails to internalize rapidly . Thus , morphologically discernible clathrin structures do appear to cluster the same constitutively internalized cargo . Another ( possibly related ) issue is , what prevents the flat clathrin arrays from forming invaginated buds ? Perhaps information can be gleaned from comparison with another membrane compart - ment where flat clathrin arrays also form with no evidence of rounded bud production : on early endosomes maturing into multivesicular bodies ( Figure 1 ) . Originally discovered in 1964 [ 31 ] , we now know that these endosomal clathrin assemblies operate by sequestering cargo , just like clathrin - coated structures at the plasma membrane [ 32 ] . However , these so - called bilayered clathrin coats do not contain AP - 2 and have an unusual EM morphology that is not seen at plasma membrane plaques . The odd appearance of bilayered clathrin coats could indicate inclusion of structural components that preclude lattice curvature . In canonical , de novo – forming rounded buds , it is thought that the force to sculpt the plasma membrane may come from assembling clathrin , which has inherent curvature when pentagonal facets are incorporated into the lattice [ 22 , 27 , 33 ] ; or , instead of inducing curvature itself , clathrin may stabilize curvature resulting from thermal fluctuation – driven membrane rearrangements [ 34 ] . Do plasma membrane plaques then , like bilayered clathrin coats on early endosomes , incorporate some additional structural compo - nent ( s ) that blocks clathrin - mediated induction or stabilization of membrane curvature ? An alternative model for what prevents the basally located , flat clathrin arrays from forming invaginated buds is that it is due to a unique role for the actin cytoskeleton in plaque formation , coupled with the strength of adhesion of the basal cell surface to the underlying substrate on which cells are growing . Saffarian et al . find that actin nucleation is unnecessary for the budding of spherical coats , although it is worth noting that at the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells , where clathrin buds are incontestably spherical , actin Figure 3 . Internalizing clathrin - coated buds and plaques . Schematic depiction of a deeply invaginated clathrin - coated bud and a flat clathrin - coated plaque undergoing endocytic uptake and the resultant uncoated vesicles . Both transmembrane cargo ( green and blue receptors ) that are selectively sorted into clathrin - coated vesicles and bulk membrane - associated cell surface proteins ( orange and magenta ) that are perhaps nonselectively incorporated into plaques are shown . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pbio . 1000192 . g003 PLoS Biology | www . plosbiology . org 3 September 2009 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e1000192 does regulate vesicle internalization [ 35 ] and also drives entry of rounded clathrin - coated structures housing vesicular stomatitis virus [ 36 ] . In contrast to what Saffarian et al . observe for bud formation , nucleation of branched actin microfilaments appears to drive plaque movement into the cell [ 27 ] ( Figure 3 ) . This conclusion is based on the observations that depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton with the sponge toxin latrunculin A arrests development and internaliza - tion of extant plaques and that the branched actin regulators cortactin and Arp2 / 3 build up at plaques just prior to movement away from the cell cortex [ 27 ] . Because latrunculin A application also prevents the formation of new plaques [ 27 ] , an additional activity of the actin cytoskeleton may be to maintain the planar topology of plaques , perhaps in concert with resistance to deformation caused by tight cell adhesion to the underlying substrate . These observations of actin contributions to plaque formation in particular are intriguing , as the closest mechanistic parallels to the behavior of plaques seem to come from cortical actin patches in S . cerevisiae , the sites of clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 12 ] . While absolutely actin - dependent , cortical patches remodel the plasma membrane into tubulovesicular profiles upon internalization [ 37 ] , quite unlike what is suggested for higher eukaryotic plaques . Irrespective of mechanism , the current schematic depiction suggests that uptake of a flat clathrin sheet leads to extraneous ( noncoated ) membrane around the perimeter of the plaque also being internalized ( Figure 3 ) . Superficially , this seemingly defies the whole elegant selectivity of coat - mediated sorting . Two important questions arise from this model : how can this membrane excess prevent endocytosis of inappropriate plasma membrane segments , and how is scission regulated at the molecular level ? But perhaps the most important lingering question is what the functional significance of the flat clathrin arrays is , if they have no operative relationship to buds . Two different types of clathrin assemblies could be a physical manifestation of compositionally discrete sorting stations operating in parallel to presort cargo at the cell surface . Data to support the idea of cargo - selective clathrin coats are accumulating [ 38 – 41 ] , but do not seem to strictly reflect selective partitioning of different membrane - embedded proteins into either pits or plaques . There are , in fact , suggestions that even in BS - C - 1 cells , which lack plaques , different types of clathrin sorting structures occur [ 40 ] . Doubtless , more work is needed to establish the precise functional interrelationships between different types of clathrin - coated structures , but , unarguably , the new results from Saffarian et al . have given cell biologists much to ponder .
