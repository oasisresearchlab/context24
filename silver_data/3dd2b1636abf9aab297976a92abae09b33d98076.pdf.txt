We focus on double - stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) . The two parameters of the model , T ∗ and ν , are chosen to match its experimental force - extension curve . In comparison to its ground - state value , the bead - spring Hamiltonian is approximated in the ﬁrst order by the Hessian that is quadratic in the bead positions . The eigenmodes of the Hessian provide the longitudinal ( stretching ) and transverse ( bending ) eigenmodes of the polymer , and the corresponding eigenvalues match well with the established phenomenology of semiﬂexible polymers . At the Hessian approximation of the Hamiltonian , the polymer dynamics is linear . Using the longitudinal and transverse eigenmodes , for the linearized problem , we obtain analytical expressions of ( i ) the autocorrelation function of the end - to - end vector , ( ii ) the autocorrelation function of a bond ( i . e . , a spring , or a tangent ) vector at the middle of the chain , and ( iii ) the mean - square displacement of a tagged bead in the middle of the chain , as sum over the contributions from the modes — the so - called “mode sums” . We also perform simulations with the full dynamics of the model . The simulations yield numerical values of the correlations functions ( i - iii ) that agree very well with the analytical expressions for the linearized dynamics . This does not however mean that the nonlinearities are not present . In fact , we also study the mean - square displacement of the longitudinal component of the end - to - end vector that showcases strong nonlinear eﬀects in the polymer dynamics , and we identify at least an eﬀective t 7 / 8 power - law regime in its time - dependence . Nevertheless , in comparison to the full mean - square displacement of the end - to - end vector the nonlinear eﬀects remain small at all times — it is in this sense we state that our results demonstrate that the linearized dynamics suﬃces for dsDNA fragments that are shorter than or comparable to the persistence length . Our results are consistent with those of the wormlike chain ( WLC ) model , the commonly used descriptive tool of semiﬂexible polymers . PACS numbers : 36 . 20 . - r , 64 . 70 . km , 82 . 35 . Lr 2 I . INTRODUCTION The last decades have witnessed a surge in research activities in the physical properties of biopolymers , such as double - stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) , ﬁlamental actin ( F - actin ) and micro - tubules . Semiﬂexibility is a common feature they share ; as they preserve mechanical rigidity over a range , characterized by the persistence length l p , along their contour . ( E . g . , for a ds - DNA , F - actin and microtubules , l p ∼ 50 nm [ 1 – 3 ] , ∼ 16 µ m [ 4 ] and ∼ 5 mm [ 5 ] respectively . ) Mechanical properties of semiﬂexible polymers are well - captured by the Kratky - Porod worm - like chain ( WLC ) model [ 6 ] , wherein the chain conformation is described by an inextensible and diﬀerentiable curve . In general , the stretching modulus for semiﬂexible polymers is far greater than their bending modulus , i . e . , the chains are eﬀectively inextensible at the length for which the persistence length is relevant . The WLC model [ 6 ] , its subsequent modiﬁcations [ 7 – 10 ] , and recent analyses [ 11 – 16 ] have been very successful in describing static / mechanical properties of dsDNA , such as its force - extension curve and the radial distribution function of its end - to - end distance . For the study of dynamics , the WLC model needs to be extended . This is done by a Langevin - like description of sideways excursions of the WLC . The contour length of the polymer is constrained in the original WLC model , and Lagrangian multipliers of a varying degree of sophistication need to be implemented in order to enforce a contour length that is either strictly ﬁxed [ 17 – 21 ] , or ﬁxed on average [ 22 , 23 ] . This enforcement allows for the calculation of many dynamical quantities theoretically . It also makes it diﬃcult to deal with motion along the WLC’s contour [ 24 ] , which become relevant , e . g . , in crowded conditions . In this context , we note that the standard interpretation of the “stored lengths” for semiﬂexible polymers are their ( transverse ) thermal undulations [ 25 ] ( which are penalized ) . Although this interpretation is consistent with the dynamics of stored lengths [ 25 – 29 ] , and allows one to intuitively conceptualize chain tension along the contour , the interplay between local extensibility and dynamics remains somewhat problematic , unlike in bead - spring models . In order to circumvent some of the diﬃculties , in a recent paper ( hereafter referred to as paper I ) [ 30 ] two of us recently introduced a bead - spring model for extensible semiﬂexible polymers in Hamiltonian formulation , in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions . In this paper we use this bead - spring model to study the dynamics of polymer chains which are shorter than or of the order of the persistence length . In particular , we have in mind the 3 simulation of the dynamics of crosslinked networks of semiﬂexible polymers such as actin [ 31 ] ; ﬁrst making the network conﬁgurations continuous , and then discretizing them again , seems a bit indirect ; we prefer to work with a discrete model right from the start . Paper I focused on dsDNA and matched the model to its force extension curve in terms of two parameters , T ∗ and ν . In comparison to its groundstate value , the bead - spring Hamiltonian is approximated in the ﬁrst order by the Hessian that is quadratic in the bead positions . The eigenmodes of the Hessian provide the longitudinal ( stretching ) and transverse ( bending ) eigenmodes of the polymer , and the corresponding eigenvalues for the stretching ( longitudinal ) and the bending ( transverse ) modes , indexed by p ( p = 1 , 2 , . . . , N ) , were shown to scale as ζ lp ∼ ( p / N ) 2 and ζ tp ∼ p 2 ( p − 1 ) 2 / N 4 respectively for small p . These are the characteristic signatures of semiﬂexible polymers [ 32 ] . In this paper , also focused on dsDNA , we exploit the knowledge on these modes to theoretically obtain some interesting dynamical quantities , such as ( i ) the end - to - end vector autocorrelation function , ( ii ) the correlation function of a bond vector in the middle of the chain , and ( iii ) the mean - squared displacement ( MSD ) of a tagged bead . In the linear regime , where the modes can be taken as independent , our ( analytical ) mode sum results for the above quantities ( i - iii ) are the following . The end - to - end vector autocorrelation function for the chain decays in time as a stretched exponential with an exponent 3 / 4 , crossing over to pure exponential decay at the terminal time τ ∗ = ( ζ t 2 ) − 1 ; this exponent is partially shared with that of the WLC [ 20 ] . The autocorrelation of the orientation of the middlemost bond vector decays in time in a similar manner , but with an exponent 1 / 4 ; this property , too , is partially shared with the WLC [ 20 ] . The mean - square displacement ( MSD ) of the middle bead shows anomalous diﬀusion with an exponent 3 / 4 until time τ ∗ , beyond which its motion becomes diﬀusive ; this property has been reported for the WLC [ 21 , 32 ] , as well from experiments [ 33 – 35 ] . The full dynamics of semiﬂexible polymers in our model is obviously nonlinear , and we also perform simulations of the full dynamics for chains . We ﬁnd that for dsDNA the mode sums agree remarkably well with the numerical values obtained from simulations . This does not however mean that the nonlinearities are not present . Indeed , we ﬁnd that the MSD of the longitudinal component of the end - to - end vector showcases strong nonlinear eﬀects in the polymer dynamics , and we identify an eﬀective t 7 / 8 power - law regime in its time - dependence . We show that the nonlinear eﬀects in the MSD of the longitudinal component of the end - to - end vector increase with increasing length for dsDNA ; nevertheless , in comparison to the 4 full mean - square displacement of the end - to - end vector the nonlinear eﬀects remain small at all times . It is in this sense we state that the linearized dynamics suﬃces for dsDNA fragments that are shorter than or comparable to the persistence length . From the results above , which are expanded further in the paper in great detail , we hope that conﬁdence can build up on our model . The results are trivially extended to other semiﬂexible polymers as long as the model parameter values are matched to the experimental ones , as demonstrated in paper I . The structure of this paper is as follows . Given that the model was described in a fair amount of detail in paper I , we ﬁrst brieﬂy introduce the model and describe its key characteristics ( specially those that are needed for the calculations presented in this paper ) in Sec . II . In Sec . III we elaborate on the ( linearized ) polymer dynamics , and in Sec . IV we analytically determine ( and verify by simulations ) the behavior of the autocorrelation function of the end - to - end vector of the chain , that of a bond vector at the middle of the chain , and the MSD of a tagged bead in terms of the mode sums . We dedicate Sec . V to separating the longitudinal and transverse components of dynamical quantities , and Sec . VI to nonlinear aspects of the full polymer dynamics , specially the MSD of the longitudinal component of the end - to - end vector . We ﬁnish the paper in Sec . VII with a comparison of our results with those of the WLC model . II . THE MODEL , THE GROUNDSTATE OF THE HAMILTONIAN , AND ITS ME - CHANICAL PROPERTIES IN THE HESSIAN APPROXIMATION In this section we brieﬂy introduce the model , the groundstate of the Hamiltonian , and its key characteristics in the Hessian approximation . A . The model We describe the polymer chain consisting of ( N + 1 ) beads , located at r 0 , . . . , r N by the Hamiltonian ( with stretching , bending and length parameters λ and κ and d respectively ) H = λ N (cid:88) n = 1 ( | u n | − d ) 2 − 2 κ N − 1 (cid:88) n = 1 u n · u n + 1 . ( 1 ) 5 Here u n is the bond vector between the ( n − 1 ) - th and the n - th beads . Given that in the limit of nonzero d and large λ and κ , it corresponds to the WLC , it is useful to take ν = κ / λ as a parameter of the model . Hereafter , with dimensionless temperature T ∗ = k B T / ( λd 2 ) , and having made u n ’s unit of length , we write the Hamiltonian as H k B T = 1 T ∗ (cid:34) N (cid:88) n = 1 ( | u n | − 1 ) 2 − 2 ν N − 1 (cid:88) n = 1 u n · u n + 1 (cid:35) . ( 2 ) Stability of the Hamiltonian naturally requires ν < 1 / 2 . The two parameters for this model , T ∗ and ν can be ﬁxed by matching to the force - extension curve . This was carried out for dsDNA in paper I , leading to the values T ∗ = 0 . 034 , ν = 0 . 35 , and correspondingly , the persistence length l p = ( ν / T ∗ ) bd = 114 bd , where the value of b is the equilibrium bond length in dimensionless units , deﬁned in Eq . ( 5 ) . The quantity bd corresponds to the length of a dsDNA basepair ≈ 3 Å [ 30 ] . We will use these values for our simulations all throughout the paper , while we stress that the simulation results are trivially extended for other semiﬂexible polymers as long as the parameters T ∗ and ν are adjusted to match the corresponding force - extension curve . Note from Eq . ( 1 ) that the strength of the stretching term is given by λd 2 = k B T / T ∗ ≈ 30 k B T . This means that for all practical purposes the bond lengths of the chain are ﬂuctu - ating around bd ≈ 3 Å only by a few percent . B . Groundstate of the Hamiltonian The groundstate of the Hamiltonian is obtained from the condition ∂ [ H / ( k B T ) ] ∂ u n = 1 T ∗ [ u n − ˆ u n − ν ( u n + 1 + u n − 1 ) ] = 0 . ( 3 ) In the groundstate all the bond vectors align — i . e . , in the groundstate the chain conﬁg - uration is that of a straight rod . An exact expression can be found for the bond length [ 30 ] | u n | = 1 1 − 2 ν (cid:20) 1 − cosh { α ( N + 1 − 2 n ) } cosh { α ( N + 1 ) } (cid:21) , ( 4 ) with α = 12 cosh − 1 ( 1 / ( 2 ν ) ) . Far away from the chain ends the bond lengths become equal [ = b ] , satisfying [ 30 ] b − 1 − 2 νb = 0 , or b = 1 / ( 1 − 2 ν ) . ( 5 ) 6 Note the value bd = d / ( 1 − 2 ν ) corresponds to the length of a dsDNA basepair ≈ 3 Å , which determines the choice for d in case of dsDNA [ 30 ] . C . Mechanical properties of the model : the Hessian approximation The energy around the minimum ( i . e . , around the groundstate of the Hamiltonian ) varies quadratically with the { r n } s at the ﬁrst order of approximation , and is dictated by the Hessian matrix ∂ 2 H / ( ∂ r m ∂ r n ) . The eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix have three branches : a longitudinal one , for which the eigenvectors are aligned along the groundstate conﬁguration ( straight rod ) of the chain , and two identical sets of transverse ones . The decay spectrum of the longitudinal modes is given by [ 30 ] ζ lp = 2 (cid:20) 1 − cos (cid:18) pπ N + 1 (cid:19)(cid:21) (cid:20) 1 − 2 ν cos (cid:18) pπ N + 1 (cid:19)(cid:21) , ( 6 ) which increase as ( p / N ) 2 for low p - values , with p = 0 , 1 , 2 , · · · , N . The modes p = 0 , having a zero eigenvalue , correspond to the center - of - mass motion . The transverse modes have also a zero eigenvalue for p = 1 , corresponding to the invariance of the Hamiltonian to an overall transverse rotation of the chain . Further , the transverse eigenspectrum agrees very well with the approximate expression [ 30 ] ζ tp ≈ 4 ν (cid:18) 1 − cos (cid:20) pπ N + 1 (cid:21)(cid:19) (cid:18) 1 − cos (cid:20) ( p − 1 ) π N + 1 (cid:21)(cid:19) , ( 7 ) i . e . , ζ tp ∼ p 2 ( p − 1 ) 2 / N 4 for small p . For low p this behavior is characteristic for semiﬂexible chains [ 32 ] . The eigenfunctions of the longitudinal modes are the same as those for the Rouse modes : φ n , p = (cid:18) 2 N + 1 (cid:19) 1 / 2 cos (cid:20) p ( n + 1 / 2 ) π N + 1 (cid:21) . ( 8 ) The transverse mode eigenfunctions are not markedly diﬀerent , but have to be determined numerically . Note also that the eigenfunctions ( 8 ) are even for even p under reversal of the bead indices [ i . e . , i ↔ ( N − i ) ] and the odd p are odd . The motion of the center - of - mass is independent of the other modes of the system and it plays no role for the properties that we consider , except for the MSD of the tagged bead , which is partly due to internal motion and partly driven by the center - of - mass motion . For 7 the other properties it is convenient to view the chain in the coordinate system where the center - of - mass is at the origin of the coordinate system . The modes form a complete basis , so any quantity that is a linear expression in the coordinates , can be expressed in terms of this basis . This is the key to analytically evaluate the quantities in the next section . The transverse modes corresponding to p = 1 are special in the sense that they induce a rotation of the reference groundstate . The eigenvector has therefore the form φ tn , 1 = − r ( 0 ) n / √ I , with I = (cid:88) n ( r ( 0 ) n ) 2 = b 2 N 3 / 12 . ( 9 ) I is the moment of inertia of the groundstate in dimensionless units [ 30 ] . Actually the repre - sentation of the conﬁguration in terms of modes with respect to a groundstate is redundant . One could take any ﬁxed groundstate as reference . As the two transverse modes p = 1 do not decay , they would grow in size due to the random forces as random walkers , indicating that the reference groundstate is not anymore in line with the actual shape of the chain . However by rotating the direction of the reference groundstate one can set the two transverse modes for p = 1 equal to zero . The representation with vanishing transverse modes p = 1 is unique . III . POLYMER DYNAMICS Although the concept of the modes originate from the Hessian approximation , they can be used to describe the full polymer dynamics , since they provide a complete set of orthogonal basis functions . In this section we show how this can be achieved . If we denote the modes by Ψ p ( t ) , then they can be expressed in terms of the bead co - ordinates { r } n ( t ) as Ψ p ( t ) = (cid:88) n [ r n ( t ) − r ( 0 ) n ( t ) ] φ n , p , ( 10 ) where r ( 0 ) n ( t ) is the position of the n - th bead in the reference groundstate . It is important to note here that the instantaneous position of the center - of - mass of the reference groundstate , which is also its midpoint , coincides with the instantaneous position of the center - of - mass of the chain itself . Here φ n , p symbolically stands for both the longitudinal as well as the 8 transverse eigenfunctions . As the transformation from r n ( t ) − r ( 0 ) n ( t ) to Ψ p ( t ) is orthogonal , the inverse relation reads r n ( t ) = r ( 0 ) n ( t ) + (cid:88) p φ n , p Ψ p ( t ) , ( 11 ) Note that the modes give deviations from the reference groundstate . Thus , although the longitudinal modes have the same eigenfunction and eigenvalue as the Rouse modes , Ψ p ( t ) is not the same as the Rouse mode amplitude , since the latter is expressed in terms of the positions r n ( t ) , while the former are expressed in terms of the deviations r n ( t ) − r ( 0 ) n ( t ) . In the overdamped limit the dynamical equation of the n - th bead is given by d r n dt = − ξ − 1 ∂ H ∂ r n + g n ( t ) , ( 12 ) where ξ is the friction coeﬃcient acting on the bead due to the viscosity of the surrounding medium in the overdamped description , and g n ( t ) is the thermal noise term satisfying the ﬂuctuation - dissipation relation (cid:104) g m ( t ) g n ( t (cid:48) ) (cid:105) = ( 2 k B T / ξ ) I δ mn δ ( t − t (cid:48) ) with I as the identity tensor . Since the eigenmodes of the Hessian matrix provide a complete orthogonal basis , Eq . ( 12 ) can simply be rewritten in terms of the mode amplitudes { Ψ p } . Further , in terms of the dimensionless time unit τ = λt / ξ their dynamical evolution of the modes is given by the Langevin equation d Ψ p ( τ ) dτ = − ζ p Ψ p ( τ ) + H p ( τ ) + G p ( τ ) , ( 13 ) where ζ p is used to collectively denote the decay constants for the modes ( ζ p = ζ lp for longi - tudinal and = ζ tp for transverse modes ) and G p are random forces obeying the ﬂuctuation - dissipation theorem (cid:104) G p ( τ ) G q ( τ (cid:48) ) (cid:105) = 2 T ∗ I δ pq δ ( τ − τ (cid:48) ) . ( 14 ) The term H p ( τ ) represents the coupling between the modes . The Hessian matrix diagonalizes the Hamiltonian to second order in the deviations from the reference groundstate . The term H p ( τ ) , henceforth referred to as the “coupling force” , results from higher order deviations . The average magnitude of the modes in the Hessian approximation of the Hamiltonian is of order √ T ∗ as the random forces G p have this magnitude according to Eq . ( 14 ) . The coupling forces are of order T ∗ , since they result from products of modes . In the next section we leave them out , and this deﬁnes precisely the linearized regime , where thermal ﬂuctuations are important , but the modes remain the independent degrees of freedom for the dynamics . 9 A . Linearized Dynamics We now outline the simpliﬁcations if one neglects the coupling force H p . Omitting the coupling force leads to modes evolving independently in time according to an Ornstein - Uhlenbeck process . For such a process , the conditional probability of having a value Ψ p ( τ ) , given that it had the value Ψ p ( 0 ) at τ = 0 , follows as P [ Ψ p ( τ ) | Ψ p ( 0 ) ] = 1 w p ( τ ) √ π exp (cid:20) − ( ∆ Ψ ) 2 2 w 2 p ( τ ) (cid:21) , ( 15 ) with ∆ Ψ = Ψ p ( τ ) − Ψ p ( 0 ) exp ( − ζ p τ ) , ( 16 ) where ζ p is used to collectively denote ζ lp or ζ tp as applicable . In other words , the conditional average of Ψ p ( τ ) , given the value Ψ p ( 0 ) at τ = 0 , equals (cid:104) Ψ p ( τ ) (cid:105) Ψ p ( 0 ) = Ψ p ( 0 ) exp ( − ζ p τ ) . ( 17 ) The width w p ( τ ) of the distribution is given by w 2 p ( τ ) = T ∗ 1 − exp ( − 2 ζ p τ ) ζ p . ( 18 ) Knowing the temporal evolution , averages can be worked out by using the equilibrium averages (cid:104) Ψ p (cid:105) = 0 , (cid:104) Ψ p Ψ q (cid:105) = δ p , q I T ∗ ζ p . ( 19 ) With the rules ( 17 ) and ( 19 ) the equilibrium averages of time - dependent correlations functions can be easily evaluated . We give , as example , the end - to - end vector L , deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the ﬁrst and last bead of the chain L ( τ ) = r N ( τ ) − r 0 ( τ ) . ( 20 ) It can be written as a sum of three vectors L ( τ ) = r N ( τ ) − r 0 ( τ ) = L ( 0 ) ( τ ) + L l ( τ ) + L t ( τ ) . ( 21 ) The ﬁrst L ( 0 ) ( τ ) is the contribution of the reference groundstate L ( 0 ) ( τ ) = L ( 0 ) ˆ e 0 ( τ ) , ( 22 ) 10 where ˆ e 0 ( τ ) is the orientation of the reference groundstate . The second L l ( τ ) is the contri - bution of the longitudinal modes given by L l ( τ ) = (cid:88) p L lp Ψ lp ( τ ) . ( 23 ) The coeﬃcient L lp is the coupling of the end - to - end vector to the longitudinal modes L lp = φ lN , p − φ l 0 , p (cid:39) (cid:18) 2 N (cid:19) 1 / 2 [ ( − 1 ) p − 1 ] . ( 24 ) The third ( and the last ) contribution in ( 21 ) is the sum over the transverse modes L t ( τ ) = (cid:88) p L tp Ψ tp ( τ ) , ( 25 ) with the transverse coupling coeﬃcients L tp L tp = φ tN , p − φ t 0 , p . ( 26 ) The temporal evolution of the longitudinal and transverse parts is implied by that of the corresponding modes as given by Eq . ( 17 ) . The orientation of the reference groundstate is implicitly given by the requirement that the two transverse components of the ﬁrst mode p = 1 remain absent . Its evolution is purely diﬀusive and independent of the mode evolution . In the independent mode approximation one ﬁnds (cid:104) ˆ e 0 ( τ ) · ˆ e 0 ( 0 ) (cid:105) = exp ( − 2 D r τ ) with D r = T ∗ I , ( 27 ) where D r is the rotational diﬀusion coeﬃcient . IV . ANALYTICAL EXPRESSIONS FOR SOME INTERESTING OBSERVABLES IN THE LINEARIZED DYNAMICS , AND COMPARISON WITH dsDNA SIMULA - TIONS In this section we give the expressions for the decay of the correlation function of a number of quantities . We provide analytical expressions in the linearized dynamics approximation , as they follow from the corresponding modes , and compare the analytical results to the simulations . The simulations , incorporating the full dynamics , consist of a simple time - forward integration scheme for Eqs . ( 13 - 14 ) . 11 A . The end - to - end vector autocorrelation function We start with the end - to - end vector autocorrelation function C L ( τ ) = (cid:104) L ( τ ) · L ( 0 ) (cid:105) , ( 28 ) and evaluate this quantity analytically in the linearized approximation . The decay of the modes is independent of the orientation of the groundstate . In the linearized approximation the correlation functions are a product of the correlation function Eq . ( 27 ) of the orientation of the groundstate and the correlation function of the modes . Since , according to Eq . ( 19 ) , the equilibrium average of a single mode vanishes and transverse and longitudinal are orthogonal , we get for the correlation function ( 28 ) the sum of three contributions C L ( τ ) = (cid:0) [ L ( 0 ) ] 2 + C lL ( τ ) + C tL ( τ ) (cid:1) exp ( − 2 D r τ ) , ( 29 ) where the contributions of the longitudinal and transverse mode - sums are given by C lL ( τ ) = T ∗ (cid:88) p = 1 [ L lp ] 2 exp ( − ζ lp τ ) ζ lp , C tL ( τ ) = 2 T ∗ (cid:88) p = 2 [ L tp ] 2 exp ( − ζ tp τ ) ζ tp , ( 30 ) In the transverse sum the mode p = 1 is excluded since it is eliminated . The numerical evaluation of these mode sums is straightforward . Regarding the behavior of these mode - sums we distinguish three regimes in time . • For times where all the exponents ζ p τ are small , the exponential may be expanded , leading to a power series in τ . Note that to linear order in τ , each mode equally contributes . This regime extends to times of order 1 , since the highest modes decay with a coeﬃcient of order 1 . • For longer times the higher modes gradually start to drop out of the summation . This intermediate regime is actually the most interesting , since the sum over modes still contains many smoothly varying terms in which the low - p modes have the largest inﬂuence . In this regime the sums may be replaced by integrals of which the asymptotic properties are analyzed in Appendix A , leading to a time dependence in terms of fractional powers of τ . The regime extends to a characteristic time τ ∗ , which is of the order of N 4 ∼ ( ζ t 2 ) − 1 for the transverse modes and of order N 2 ∼ ( ζ l 1 ) − 1 for the longitudinal modes . It means that the window , in which typical longitudinal eﬀects 12 can be seen , is small with respect to that of the transverse eﬀects . Moreover the transverse modes overshadow the longitudinal modes by a factor N 2 , due to the decay constant ζ tp in the denominator which is , for low p , smaller than ζ lp by a factor N 2 . In the intermediate regime the decay , due to reorientation of the groundstate , is still small . • For τ > τ ∗ all the exponents are large and the exponentials small . Thus what remains is the decay due to rotational reorientation , governed by the diﬀusion constant D r . So only exponential decay is observed in the correlation functions . 10 - 1 10 1 10 3 10 5 10 7 τ 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 - N 2 l n C L ( τ ) N = 7 N = 15 N = 31 N = 63 ~ τ 3 / 4 ( a ) 10 - 6 10 - 3 10 0 10 3 τ / N 4 10 - 6 10 - 4 10 - 2 10 0 10 2 - N l n C L ( τ ) N = 7 N = 15 N = 31 N = 63 ~ τ ( b ) FIG . 1 : ( a ) At intermediate times the end - to - end autocorrelation function C L ( τ ) exhibits stretched exponential behavior with exponent τ 3 / 4 / N 2 . Note that the persistence length of dsDNA corre - sponds to N = 114 in dimensionless units . The simulation data are represented by points , while the solid blue lines , in excellent agreement with the simulation data , represent the corresponding the combined eﬀect of the mode - sums ( 30 ) . Note also that we cannot reliably use the Hessian ap - proximation of the Hamiltonian too much beyond N = 63 . ( b ) The stretched exponential behavior lasts till the terminal time τ ∗ ∼ N 4 , beyond which the decay becomes exponential in τ / N 3 . We now discuss the analytical behavior of the correlation function in the intermediate time regime and focus on the transverse modes , being the most interesting . The deviation of the correlation from its initial value reads 1 − C L ( τ ) C L ( 0 ) (cid:39) 16 T ∗ b 2 N 3 (cid:88) p = 3 , 5 , ··· 1 ζ tp [ 1 − exp ( − ζ tp τ ) ] . ( 31 ) Sums of the type ( 31 ) are typical for the correlation functions that we consider . They are worked out in Appendix A . With the function F 0 ( τ ) deﬁned in Eq . ( A1 ) and the result ( A6 ) 13 we get 1 − C L ( τ ) C L ( 0 ) (cid:39) 16 T ∗ b 2 N 3 F 0 ( τ ) (cid:39) Γ ( 1 / 4 ) 8 T ∗ τ 3 / 4 3 πb 2 N 2 ν 1 / 4 . ( 32 ) So at intermediate times , where the deviations of the initial value are still small , the corre - lation function decays in time as a stretched exponential : C L ( τ ) (cid:39) C L ( 0 ) exp (cid:20) − Γ ( 1 / 4 ) 8 T ∗ τ 3 / 4 3 πb 2 N 2 ν 1 / 4 (cid:21) . ( 33 ) We note that in the exponent of ( 33 ) , combination T ∗ τ 3 / 4 / N 2 can be written as the ratio ( N / l p ) [ τ 1 / 4 / N ] 3 . Since N / l p is of order 1 in the region of our interest , the ratio is a function of [ τ / τ ∗ ] 3 with τ ∗ = N 4 , which is of the order of the slowest transverse decay time 1 / ζ t 2 . So the stretched exponential behavior crosses over to exponential decay after time τ ∗ . Note that , due to numerical factors , τ ∗ is still small in comparison to 1 / D r , which scales as N 3 / T ∗ . As we corroborate the stretched exponential behavior of C L ( τ ) by means of direct simulations in Fig . 1 , we note that apart from the mode sum ( 16 ) the stretched ex - ponential behavior can be obtained by the following simple argument . First , C L ( τ ) = 1 − (cid:104) [ L ( τ ) − L ( 0 ) ] 2 (cid:105) / ( 2 (cid:104) L 2 ( 0 ) (cid:105) ) ∼ 1 − (cid:104) [ L ( τ ) − L ( 0 ) ] 2 (cid:105) / ( 2 N 2 ) is an identity . Next , in time τ 0 ∼ 1 , independent of its length , the chain ends move in real space by order N 0 ; i . e . , (cid:104) [ L ( τ 0 ) − L ( 0 ) ] 2 (cid:105) ∼ N 0 , and consequently , − log C L ( τ 0 ) ∼ 1 / N 2 . Further , beyond time τ ∗ ∼ N 4 the correlation function decays exponentially due to rotational diﬀusion dynamics with diﬀusion coeﬃcient D r ∼ N − 3 leading to − log C L ( τ ∗ ) ∼ N . Thus , if one assumes that the − log C L ( τ ) values at τ 0 ∼ 1 and at τ ∗ ∼ N 4 are bridged by an exponential function of a single character , then the only solution is a stretched exponential with exponent τ 3 / 4 / N 2 . These arguments are conﬁrmed in Fig . 1 . B . The autocorrelation function for the middle bond vector We now evaluate the autocorrelation function for the middle bond vector analytically in the linearized approximation . For the autocorrelation function for the middle bond vector we consider a chain with an even number of beads , i . e . , N is odd . Like the case of the end - to - end vector , the middle bond vector u m ( τ ) is described as u m ( τ ) = u ( 0 ) m ( τ ) + (cid:88) p u p Ψ p ( τ ) = u ( 0 ) m ( τ ) + (cid:88) p (cid:2) φ ( N + 1 ) / 2 p − φ ( N − 1 ) / 2 p (cid:3) Ψ p ( τ ) . ( 34 ) 14 Here u ( 0 ) m ( τ ) is the middle bond vector for the reference groundstate conﬁguration ( straight rod ) . Once again , u m is odd under reversal of the numbering of the beads , so the even modes do not contribute to the sum ( 34 ) . Comparing Eqs . ( 8 ) and ( 10 ) we get u p = φ ( N + 1 ) / 2 p − φ ( N − 1 ) / 2 p (cid:39) − 2 (cid:18) 2 N + 1 (cid:19) 1 / 2 sin (cid:16) pπ 2 (cid:17) sin (cid:20) pπ 2 ( N + 1 ) (cid:21) , ( 35 ) where the second identity in Eq . ( 35 ) is strict for the longitudinal components and approx - imate for the transverse ones . Beyond the time τ ∗ , since the vector u ( 0 ) m ( τ ) in the reference groundstate undergoes the same rotational diﬀusion , the expression for the autocorrelation function for the middle bond vector C m ( τ ) = (cid:104) u m ( τ ) · u m ( 0 ) (cid:105) / (cid:104) u 2 m ( 0 ) (cid:105) is similar to those for the end - to - end vector , allowing us to write C m ( τ ) = 1 + (cid:80) p ∈ odd [ u 2 p T ∗ ] / [ ( u ( 0 ) m ) 2 ζ p ] exp ( − ζ p τ ) 1 + (cid:80) p ∈ odd [ u 2 p T ∗ ] / [ ( u ( 0 ) m ) 2 ζ p ] exp ( − 2 D r τ ) , ( 36 ) wherein , once again , the sum does not include p = 1 transverse modes , and each value of p for the transverse modes needs to be counted twice . The analysis of the sum over the slow modes is given in the Appendix . With the function F 2 ( τ ) deﬁned in Eq . ( A1 ) and the result ( A7 ) we get C m ( 0 ) − C m ( τ ) (cid:39) π 2 T ∗ 3 I F 2 ( τ ) (cid:39) Γ ( 3 / 4 ) N 3 T ∗ τ 1 / 4 6 πIν 3 / 4 . ( 37 ) This gives a stretched exponential C m ( τ ) (cid:39) exp (cid:20) − Γ ( 3 / 4 ) T ∗ N 3 τ 1 / 4 6 πIν 3 / 4 (cid:21) , ( 38 ) In order to appreciate the time regime in which this stretched exponent features we note again that the factor T ∗ eﬀectively counts as a factor N − 1 and that the exponential behavior lasts up to τ ∗ ∼ N 4 . In that time span the exponent is of order unity and after τ ∗ the correlation follows the diﬀusive behavior of the end - to - end vector . The veriﬁcation of this result can be found in Fig . 2 , which also demonstrates that the mode sum ( 38 ) exhibits strong ﬁnite - size eﬀects , i . e . the sum and the asymptotic fractional power diﬀer substantially . This is purely an issue related to the sum ( 36 ) — the sum can be carried out for indeﬁnitely large values of N ( but N cannot be indeﬁnitely increased in simulations , as , given that l p = 114 in dimensionless units , we cannot reliably use the 15 Hessian approximation of the Hamiltonian too much beyond N = 63 ) — and as can be seen in Fig . 2 , with increasing N the mode sum ( 36 ) does indeed approach the expected stretched exponential behavior ( 38 ) . 10 - 1 10 1 10 3 10 5 10 7 10 9 τ 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 - l n C m ( τ ) N = 7 N = 15 N = 31 N = 63 ( a ) τ 1 / 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 τ / N 4 10 - 5 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 - l n C m ( τ ) / N N = 7 N = 15 N = 31 N = 63 ( b ) τ FIG . 2 : ( a ) At intermediate times the end - to - end autocorrelation function C m ( τ ) exhibits stretched exponential behavior with exponent τ 1 / 4 . The simulation data are represented by points , while the solid blue lines , in excellent agreement with the simulation data , represent the corresponding mode sums ( 36 ) . The blue and green dashed lines correspond to the mode sum ( 36 ) for N = 127 and N = 255 respectively . ( b ) The stretched exponential behavior lasts till the terminal time τ ∗ ∼ N 4 , beyond which the decay becomes exponential in τ / N 3 . Like in the case of C L ( τ ) , the stretched exponential behavior for C m ( τ ) between τ ∼ O ( 1 ) and τ = τ ∗ can also be argued from the real - space mean - square displacement of the middle bead in the following manner . First , C m ( τ ) = 1 − 2 (cid:104) [ u m ( τ ) − u m ( 0 ) ] 2 (cid:105) / (cid:104) u 2 m ( 0 ) (cid:105) ∼ 1 − 2 (cid:104) [ u m ( τ ) − u m ( 0 ) ] 2 (cid:105) / N 0 is an identity . Next , in time τ 0 ∼ 1 the two beads connecting the middle bond vector move in real space by order N 0 ; i . e . , (cid:104) [ u m ( τ 0 ) − u m ( 0 ) ] 2 (cid:105) ∼ N 0 , and consequently , − log C m ( τ 0 ) ∼ N 0 . Further , beyond time τ ∗ ∼ N 4 the middle bond vector must undergo rotational diﬀusion with diﬀusion coeﬃcient D r ∼ N − 3 , leading to the result − log C m ( τ ∗ ) ∼ N . Thus , if one assumes that − log C m ( τ ) values at τ 0 ∼ 1 and at τ ∗ ∼ N 4 are bridged by an exponential function of a single character , then the only solution is a stretched exponential with exponent 1 / 4 . These arguments are conﬁrmed in Fig . 2 . 16 C . The mean - square displacement of the middle bead Finally , we evaluate the mean - square displacement of the middle bead in the linearized approximation . In order to avoid setting up additional simulations for chains with odd number of beads , we continue in this section with chain with even number of beads . We are then interested in the MSD of the center - of - mass of the two middlemost beads ; i . e . , the mean r m ( τ ) of the location of the ( N − 1 ) / 2 and ( N + 1 ) / 2 - th beads , r m ( τ ) = 12 [ r ( N + 1 ) / 2 ( τ ) + r ( N − 1 ) / 2 ( τ ) ] and express it in terms of the modes as r m ( τ ) = R cm ( τ ) + (cid:88) p r p Ψ p ( τ ) ≡ R cm ( τ ) + ˜ r m ( τ ) , ( 39 ) since , as noted before , the instantaneous location of the midpoint of the reference groundstate coincides with that of the chain’s center - of - mass . The corresponding mode coeﬃcient is then given by r p = φ ( N + 1 ) / 2 p + φ ( N − 1 ) / 2 p (cid:39) 2 (cid:18) 2 N + 1 (cid:19) 1 / 2 cos (cid:16) pπ 2 (cid:17) cos (cid:20) pπ 2 ( N + 1 ) (cid:21) , ( 40 ) where the second identity in Eq . ( 39 ) is strict for the longitudinal components and approx - imate for the transverse ones . The MSD of the middle bead is the sum of two terms (cid:104) ∆ r 2 m ( τ ) (cid:105) = (cid:104) [ ∆ R cm ( τ ) ] 2 (cid:105) + (cid:104) [ ∆˜ r m ( τ ) ] 2 (cid:105) , ( 41 ) as the cross terms vanish because the center - of - mass motion of the chain is independent of the internal motion represented by ˜ r m ( τ ) . The center - of - mass diﬀuses with coeﬃcient D ∼ 1 / N (cid:104) [ ∆ R cm ( τ ) ] 2 (cid:105) = 4 Dτ ( 42 ) and the internal MSD (cid:104) ∆˜ r 2 m ( τ ) (cid:105) = (cid:104) [ ˜ r m ( τ ) − ˜ r m ( 0 ) ] 2 (cid:105) , ( 43 ) can be computed from the mode sums as above . From the deﬁnition it is clear that (cid:104) ∆˜ r 2 m ( τ ) (cid:105) must asymptotically approach a constant . 17 Since the modes are independent of each other at all times , using Eqs . ( 40 - 41 ) we have (cid:104) ∆˜ r 2 m ( τ ) (cid:105) = 2 (cid:88) p T ∗ 4 ζ p (cid:2) φ ( N + 1 ) / 2 p + φ ( N − 1 ) / 2 p (cid:3) 2 [ 1 − exp ( − ζ p τ ) ] , ( 44 ) which is evaluated in the Appendix . Only the even modes contribute to the sum , and it is once again dominated by the transverse modes , with the result that at intermediate times (cid:104) ∆˜ r 2 m ( τ ) (cid:105) = Γ ( 1 / 4 ) 4 T ∗ τ 3 / 4 3 πν 1 / 4 , ( 45 ) i . e . , it increases subdiﬀusively in time with an exponent 3 / 4 . The subdiﬀusive behavior is seen until time τ ∗ , beyond which it saturates . The veriﬁcation of this result can be found in Fig . 3 , which , like Fig . 2 , also demonstrates that the conversion of the mode sum ( 30 ) to integrals suﬀers from strong ﬁnite - size eﬀects ; with increasing N the mode sum ( 30 ) does approach the expected subdiﬀusive behavior ( 44 ) . 10 - 1 10 1 10 3 10 5 10 7 10 9 τ 10 - 3 10 - 1 10 1 10 3 10 5 < ∆ r 2 ~ m ( τ ) > N = 7 N = 15 N = 31 N = 63 ( a ) τ 3 / 4 10 - 9 10 - 6 10 - 3 10 0 10 3 τ / N 4 10 - 8 10 - 7 10 - 6 10 - 5 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 < ∆ r 2 ~ m ( τ ) > / N 3 N = 7 N = 15 N = 31 N = 63 ( b ) FIG . 3 : ( a ) At intermediate times (cid:104) ∆˜ r 2 m ( τ ) increases subdiﬀusively with exponent 3 / 4 . The sim - ulation data are represented by points , while the solid blue lines , in excellent agreement with the simulation data , represent the corresponding mode sums ( 44 ) . The blue and green dashed lines correspond to the mode sum ( 44 ) for N = 127 and N = 255 respectively . ( b ) The subdiﬀusive behavior lasts till the terminal time τ ∗ ∼ N 4 , beyond which the data ﬂatten out as they should . The subdiﬀusive behavior with exponent 3 / 4 can also be argued in the following manner . In time τ 0 ∼ 1 the center - of - mass of the two middlemost beads moves by a distance of N 0 due to the internal motion , i . e . the MSD is of order N 0 . Around τ ∗ ∼ N 4 the center - of - mass motion starts to dominate and the MSD becomes order Dτ ∗ ∼ τ ∗ / N ∼ N 3 . If the two values are to be bridged by a single power - law , then the only possible exponent is 3 / 4 . 18 D .

For comparison the anticipated power τ 3 / 4 has been drawn . ( b ) Log - log plot of the longitudinal MSD of the end - to - end vector as given by the expression ( 30 ) for a series of lengths . The convergence to the anticipated power τ 1 / 2 is too slow to be useful . In the previous subsections , we have extracted stretched exponents from the mode sums by replacing the sums over the mode index p by integrals and approximating the modes by their low - p behavior as given in ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) . Since our interest is in chain lengths shorter than or comparable to the persistence length , it is important to know how well the mode sums converge to this asymptotic behavior . In Fig . 4 we have plotted the transverse mode sums for the MSD of the end - to - end vector , for a set of chain lengths shorter and longer than the persistence length l p = 114 ( for the dsDNA parameters T ∗ = 0 . 034 and ν = 0 . 35 ) . The ﬁgure shows that the mode sums , in the intermediate time regime τ (cid:28) τ ∗ , are very well represented by the power τ 3 / 4 over a large time domain , also for chains of the order of the persistence length . The time domain , for which the stretched exponent holds , expands with N . In the same Fig . 4 the longitudinal mode sums for the MSD of the end - to - end vector are plotted . Here one observes that the convergence to the anticipated power τ 1 / 2 is very slow . ( τ 1 / 2 follows from the replacement of the sum by an integral ) . Even a chain of length of N = 8191 , which is about 75 times the persistence length , cannot be represented in a substantial time domain by the power τ 1 / 2 . This is one of the reason that we have concentrated in the previous sections on the analysis of the transverse mode sums . The 19 other reason is that the contribution of the longitudinal modes in the total end - to - end vector remains small , since the transverse modes dominate for intermediate times and the orientational diﬀusion takes over for long times . E . Summary statements on linearized dynamics We now close oﬀ linearized semiﬂexible polymer dynamics with a summary . Based on the linearized dynamics for our model we have obtained analytical expressions for ( i ) the autocorrelation function of the end - to - end vector , ( ii ) the autocorrelation func - tion of a bond ( i . e . , a spring , or a tangent ) vector at the middle of the chain and ( iii ) the mean - square displacement of a tagged bead in the middle of the chain , as sum over the con - tributions from the transverse and / or longitudinal modes — the so - called mode sums . The mode sum exhibit the following asymptotic behavior . ( i ) The end - to - end vector autocor - relation function for the chain decays in time as a stretched exponential with an exponent 3 / 4 , crossing over to pure exponential decay at the terminal time τ ∗ = ( ζ t 2 ) − 1 . ( ii ) The autocorrelation of the orientation of the middlemost bond vector decays in time in a simi - lar manner , but with an exponent 1 / 4 . ( iii ) The mean - square displacement ( MSD ) of the middle bead shows anomalous diﬀusion with an exponent 3 / 4 until time τ ∗ , beyond which its motion becomes diﬀusive . The convergence with increasing N to the asymptotic power is fast for the transverse mode sum and very slow for the longitudinal mode sum . Further , dynamical quantities as obtained from mode sums show a remarkable agreement with numerical simulation results of dsDNA chains with lengths shorter or of the order of the persistence length . The main exceptions to this agreement stem from the fact that if the chain bends , it tends to conserve its curvilinear length , thereby reducing the distance between the ends . The mode sums do not capture this eﬀect , which is nonlinear and a consequence of coupling between the transverse and longitudinal modes . This is discussed in more detail in Sec . V . V . SEPARATING THE LONGITUDINAL AND TRANSVERSE COMPONENTS In the previous section we have compared the results of linearized dynamics with the simulations , involving the full polymer dynamics of the model in terms of three correla - 20 tion functions . The observed excellent agreement suggests that for lengths less than l p the linearized dynamics suﬃces , which opens up a wide avenue of opportunity for analytical calculations using our model . In this and the next sections we will examine this agreement in further detail , taking the end - to - end vector as an example . The end - to - end vector correlation function calculations in Fig . 1 ( and other quantities ) did not need a distinction between longitudinal and transverse ﬂuctuations , hence the sim - ulations for these quantities can be carried out with any integration scheme , including the integration of equations ( 12 ) employing the positions of the beads . As we now embark on separating the longitudinal and transverse ﬂuctuations , the polymer dynamics in the simu - lations requires more care , in particular the role of the coupling forces and the orientation of the groundstate , as will be described below . The coupling force arises from the derivative of the contour length L c and in terms of the mode representation , we have H p = (cid:88) n (cid:34) ∂L c ∂ r n − (cid:18) ∂L c ∂ r n (cid:19) ( 0 ) (cid:35) φ n , p . ( 46 ) Having worked out the partial derivatives we ﬁnd for the longitudinal component H lp = (cid:88) n (cid:0) ˆ u n − ˆ u ( 0 ) n (cid:1) l (cid:2) φ ln , p − φ ln − 1 , p (cid:3) ( 47 ) and for the transverse components H tp = (cid:88) n u tn (cid:18) 1 u n − 1 u ( 0 ) n (cid:19) (cid:2) φ tn , p − φ tn − 1 , p (cid:3) . ( 48 ) It is worthwhile to note that the longitudinal coupling force arises from the transverse ﬂuctuations — a pure longitudinal deformation will not change the direction ˆ u n , as occurring in Eq . ( 47 ) , from that in the groundstate ˆ u ( 0 ) n . This is also reﬂected in the fact that the longitudinal modes are exact eigenmodes of the system in the groundstate . The simulation is carried out by forward - integrating Eq . ( 13 ) . For the integration we represent the chain conﬁgurations by continuously alternating between the mode represen - tation ( for the timestep ) and the position representation ( for the calculation of the coupling forces ) . For the longitudinal components the transformation back and forth between the mode representation and position representation is a ( fast ) Fourier Transform . For the transverse components the back and forth transformations are found using the transverse eigenfunctions φ t n , p . 21 As discussed in Sec . II C , the groundstate is identiﬁed by enforcing the components of the transverse modes for p = 1 strictly equal to zero . This condition must be satisﬁed , in principle , at every time step , requiring an adjustment of the orientation of the groundstate , by rotating the direction ˆ e 0 around an axis ω perpendicular ˆ e 0 . The adjustment of the orientation of the groundstate leaves the spatial conﬁguration of the beads invariant , but induces a transformation of its representation in modes . The direction of ω as well as details of the transformation are provided in Appendix B . 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 τ 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 [ L ( τ ) - L ( 0 ) ] 2 ( a ) 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 τ 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 [ L ( τ ) - L ( 0 ) ] 2 ( b ) FIG . 5 : The orientational , longitudinal and transverse components of the mean - square displace - ments [ L ( 0 ) ( τ ) − L ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ] 2 ( linearized theoretical results in solid lines and simulation data in red symbols ) , [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 ( linearized theoretical results in dash - dotted lines and simulation data in magenta symbols ) , and [ L t ( τ ) − L t ( 0 ) ] 2 ( linearized theoretical results in dashed lines and simulation data in green symbols ) respectively : ( a ) N = 7 , ( b ) N = 63 . The linearized theoretical results and the simulation data for the orientational , longi - tudinal and transverse components of the mean - square displacements [ L ( 0 ) ( τ ) − L ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ] 2 , [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 and [ L t ( τ ) − L t ( 0 ) ] 2 respectively [ see Eq . ( 21 ) for the deﬁnitions ] are compared for N = 7 and 63 for dsDNA in Fig . 5 . For very short chains ( such as N = 7 ) the coupling force stays small in amplitude , explaining the excellent agreement between the simulations and the linearized dynamics results . For N = 63 however , we see that at long times , the agreement between the linearized theory and the simulation is rather poor for the longitu - dinal component [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 . Despite this disagreement , we clearly see in Fig . 5 ( b ) that in the region of the strongest disagreement the orientational component [ L ( 0 ) ( τ ) − L ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ] 2 — for which the linearized theoretical results and the simulation data do agree very well — 22 is two orders of magnitude stronger than the longitudinal component [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 . This observation is therefore consistent with the good agreement between the linearized theoreti - cal results and the simulation data for C L ( τ ) , wherein all the orientational , longitudinal and transverse components combine together . Figure 5 ( b ) shows that the main deviations from the linear theory are in the longitudinal component of the end - to - end vector for asymptotic large times . This is a result of the coupling between the longitudinal and the transverse modes . The bending of the chain due to transverse ﬂuctuations shortens the end - to - end distance in the longitudinal direction . The next section is devoted to a further analysis of these eﬀects . VI . NON - LINEAR EFFECTS IN SEMIFLEXIBLE POLYMER DYNAMICS Semiﬂexible polymer dynamics is inherently nonlinear . If the nonlinear eﬀects get strong then they clearly ruin the agreement between the ( linearized ) mode sums and the simulation data . An interesting question is , why do they show up strongly in longitudinal ﬂuctuations , e . g . , in the quantity [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 ? There are two diﬀerent classes of situations where we expect the nonlinearities to become strong . ( i ) The ﬁrst case is when the chain gets long in comparison to its persistence length . In this case the transverse ﬂuctuations become progressively easier to excite with increasing chain lengths , and the eﬀective chain length along the vector ˆ e 0 that denotes the orientation of the groundstate shortens from L ( 0 ) 0 . ( ii ) The second case is when the chain gets progressively more inextensible . In the limit when the chain is completely inextensible , like the WLC model , any transverse ﬂuctuation results in an immediate shortening of the end - to - end distance . This case is best analyzed by reducing T ∗ , i . e . , reducing the stretchability of the bonds , while simultaneously keeping the persistence length l p = ν / T ∗ ﬁxed . In this case one expects strong nonlinearities to emerge also in chains that are short with respect to the persistence length . Both cases aﬀect longitudinal ﬂuctuations the most , hence the quantity [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 is the most sensitive to nonlinearities in the model . We ﬁrst discuss case ( i ) as a follow - up of [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 in Fig . 5 for dsDNA . In order to clearly see the non - linear eﬀects we have plotted in Fig . 6 the simulated values as well as the diﬀerence between the simulated values and that given by the corresponding linearized dynamics theory . We see that for short chains the diﬀerence remains small , while it grows 23 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 τ 10 - 1 10 1 10 3 10 5 [ L l ( τ ) - L l ( 0 ) ] 2 N = 7 N = 15 N = 31 N = 63 N = 127 N = 255 ( a ) ~ τ 7 / 8 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 τ 10 - 5 10 - 3 10 - 1 10 1 10 3 10 5 [ L l ( τ ) - L l ( 0 ) ] 2 ( s i m . - li n . t h e o r y ) N = 7 N = 15 N = 31 N = 63 N = 127 N = 255 ~ τ 7 / 8 ( b ) ~ τ FIG . 6 : Plots for the longitudinal component of [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 for dsDNA for N = 7 , 15 , 31 , 63 , 127 . and 255 . ( a ) The total value of [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 is plotted ; symbols denote simulation data , and solid lines denote the corresponding linearized mode sums for the same values of N as in the simulations ( the value of N corresponding to the mode sums increase from bottom to top ) . The dashed line shows corresponds to the power - law τ 7 / 8 . ( b ) The pure non - linear eﬀect as the diﬀerence between the simulated values and the linear contribution given by the mode sum . In the diﬀerence the emergence of an eﬀective power - law τ 7 / 8 ( solid line ) can be seen at intermediate times before leveling oﬀ . For comparison , also plotted is a dashed line showing power - law τ 1 . to substantial values for long chains . This is because the linearized theory predicts that [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 - values reach a plateau beyond the lifetime of the longitudinal modes as seen in Fig . 5 , but the simulated values keep increasing due to nonlinearities [ encoded in the coupling force term as described in Eq . ( 46 ) ] . As already explained above , the main source of this non - linear eﬀect is the shortening of the end - to - end distance along the vector ˆ e 0 due to the transverse ﬂuctuations . Indeed , in support of the arguments given in the above paragraph , we ﬁnd that with increasing chain lengths the longitudinal modes , in particular those with a low odd index p , do not ﬂuctuate around zero any more ( as assumed in the linearized dynamics ) , but around a positive average . If we translate these positive averages back to spatial positions , we ﬁnd a shorter distance (cid:104) ( r N − r 0 ) · ˆ e 0 (cid:105) than the groundstate value L ( 0 ) . The shortening of the distance becomes for longer chains much larger than the amplitude of the longitudinal ﬂuctuations . An interesting feature of the curves of Fig . 6 is that [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 at intermediate times is a combination of the ( linear ) mode sums and inherently nonlinear behavior of the model . 24 Indeed , the pure nonlinear contributions to [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 to an eﬀective power - law τ 7 / 8 at intermediate times before the data level oﬀ , as indicated by the straight line in the log - log plot in Fig . 6 ( b ) . The mode sum contributions , on the other hand , although very slowly converges to τ 1 / 2 behavior as seen in Fig . 4 , we expect an eﬀective exponent less than 7 / 8 for [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 , as conﬁrmed in Fig . 6 ( a ) . ( We mention in passing here that the nonlinear eﬀects in the longitudinal ﬂuctuations are well - documented in the WLC literature . E . g . , for ( inextensible ) WLC model , a power law in time with exponent 7 / 8 is reported for the ﬂuctuations in the longitudinal component of the end - to - end vector [ 20 , 27 , 36 ] — this prompts the comparison of our data in Fig . 6 to a power - law τ 7 / 8 . We will return to this in the next section . ) 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 τ 10 - 4 10 - 2 10 0 10 2 10 4 [ L l ( τ ) - L l ( 0 ) ] 2 T * = 0 . 034 T * = 0 . 01 T * = 0 . 001 T * = 0 . 0001 ( a ) ~ τ 7 / 8 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 τ 10 - 6 10 - 4 10 - 2 10 0 10 2 10 4 [ L l ( τ ) - L l ( 0 ) ] 2 ( s i m . - li n . t h e o r y ) T * = 0 . 034 T * = 0 . 01 T * = 0 . 001 T * = 0 . 0001 ~ τ 7 / 8 ( b ) ~ τ FIG . 7 : The longitudinal component of the end - to - end vector [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 for dsDNA ( T ∗ = 0 . 034 ) and a few other values of T ∗ . Here N = 63 and the persistence length is ≈ 114 nm for all cases . As in Fig . 6 we plot in part ( a ) the total value of [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 ; symbols denote simulation data , and solid lines denote the corresponding linearized mode sums for the same values of T ∗ as in the simulations ( the value of T ∗ corresponding to the mode sums increase from bottom to top ) , and the dashed line shows corresponds to the power - law τ 7 / 8 . in part ( b ) the diﬀerence between the simulation and the linear contribution as given by the mode sum . Again in the diﬀerence the emergence of an eﬀective power - law τ 7 / 8 ( solid line ) can be seen at intermediate times before leveling oﬀ . For comparison , also plotted is a dashed line showing power - law τ 1 . Case ( ii ) yields a similar picture . In the limit of small T ∗ ( and l p = ν / T ∗ still ﬁxed at its dsDNA value ≈ 114 nm ) , the contribution of the longitudinal ﬂuctuations within the linearized theory vanishes with the power T ∗ , since the decay of the modes becomes 25 independent of ν for ν → 0 . However the transverse modes , for which the decay coeﬃcients are proportional to ν [ c . f . Eq . ( 7 ) ] , survive longer being proportional to T ∗ / ν . Since the transverse modes for more unstretchable chains imply a shortening of the end - to - end distance with respect to the groundstate , the longitudinal modes again get a non - vanishing average in equilibrium . This is shown in Fig . 7 , where we have plotted the longitudinal component of the end - to - end vector for chain length N = 63 with l p ≈ 114 nm not only for dsDNA ( T ∗ = 0 . 034 ) , but also for T ∗ = 0 . 01 , 0 . 001 and 0 . 0001 . Again we plot [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 as well as the diﬀerence between the simulation and the linear contribution as given by the mode sum , and the total . The [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 data show an eﬀective exponent less than 7 / 8 , while the pure nonlinear contributions to [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 , although initially very small with respect to the total contribution , they grow with time , as an eﬀective power - law τ 7 / 8 at intermediate times , before saturating to diﬀerent plateau - values for diﬀerent values of T ∗ . We note that it diﬃcult to extract from the total contribution an eﬀective power law , since the linear contribution suﬀers from large ﬁnite size eﬀects as Fig . 4 shows . Our results for [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 bear strong resemblance to those of Refs . [ 16 , 36 ] where the extensible WLC has also been shown to demonstrate the exponents 1 / 2 and 7 / 8 at intermediate times in the dynamic elastic modulus , obtained from the ( length ﬂuctuation ) response of the chain to a ( ﬂuctuating ) tensile force . Linear response theory suggests that the dynamic elastic modulus via a memory kernel , must relate to the equilibrium ﬂuctuations in the longitudinal end - to - end vector studied by ourselves . For tagged monomer displace - ment , such a case has been studied in detail by one of us [ 37 , 38 ] by means of Generalized Langevin Equation ( GLE ) formulation . In the present case however , we do not know how to quantitatively relate our results for the mean - square displace longitudinal end - to - end vector and those of Refs . [ 16 , 36 ] using a GLE , or some other , formulation . We again emphasize here that even at the times when the nonlinear contribution to [ L l ( τ ) − L l ( 0 ) ] 2 become signiﬁcant , it still remains typically two orders of magnitude smaller than the orientational component [ L ( 0 ) ( τ ) − L ( 0 ) ( 0 ) ] 2 , so nonlinearities make little diﬀerence for the quantities dependent on the overall end - to - end vector . It is in this sense we state , in view of Figs . 1 - 5 that the linearized dynamics suﬃces very well for dsDNA fragments that are shorter than or comparable to the persistence length . 26 VII . CONCLUSION With a recently introduced Hamiltonian bead - spring model for semiﬂexible polymers [ 30 ] , in this paper we have studied the dynamical properties of a chain of length N . Speciﬁ - cally , using linearized polymer dynamics we have analytically calculated the autocorrelation functions of the end - to - end vector , that of the orientation of the middle bond and the mean - square displacement of the middlemost bead of the chain . The analytical solutions are facilitated by the fact that we know the dynamical mode structures analytically in the Hessian approximation of the Hamiltonian . There are longitudinal and transverse modes , and the terminal time τ ∗ ∼ N 4 is determined as the inverse of the smallest eigenvalue ζ t 2 for the transverse modes . Up to time τ ∗ the autocorrelation functions for the end - to - end vector and that of the middle spring vector show stretched exponential behavior with exponents 3 / 4 and 1 / 4 respectively , and beyond time τ ∗ the decay becomes simply exponential . The motion of the middlemost bead exhibit anomalous dynamics with an exponent 3 / 4 until time τ ∗ , and is diﬀusive thereafter . The full dynamics of semiﬂexible polymers in our model is obviously nonlinear , and we have also performed simulations of the full dynamics for chains . We ﬁnd that for dsDNA the mode sums agree remarkably well with the numerical values obtained from simulations . This does not however mean that the nonlinearities are not present . Indeed , we ﬁnd that the MSD of the longitudinal component of the end - to - end vector showcases strong nonlinear eﬀects in the polymer dynamics , and we identify at least an eﬀective t 7 / 8 power - law regime in its time - dependence . We show that the nonlinear eﬀects in the MSD of the longitudinal component of the end - to - end vector increases with increasing length for dsDNA ; nevertheless , in comparison to the full mean - square displacement of the end - to - end vector the nonlinear eﬀects remain small at all times . It is in this sense we state that the linearized dynamics suﬃces for dsDNA fragments that are shorter than or comparable to the persistence length . Given that the worm - like chain ( WLC ) is the most used model for semiﬂexible polymers , it is imperative to compare the results of the above quantities across the two models . First of all , the anomalous dynamics of the middlemost bead agree for the two models [ 21 , 32 ] , and have also been found in experiments [ 33 – 35 ] . On the other hand , the end - to - end vector correlation function has been considered in Ref . [ 20 ] , wherein (cid:104) [ L ( t ) − L ( 0 ) ] 2 (cid:105) is seen to behave as A 1 t 3 / 4 + A 2 t 7 / 8 , with A 1 and A 2 two N - dependent constants , of which the t 7 / 8 term 27 is known to originate from nonlinear eﬀects in WLC dynamics , and showcases itself in the longitudinal ﬂuctuations of the end - to - end vector . The form of the term proportional to A 1 is consistent with the stretched exponential behavior ( 33 ) when τ (cid:28) τ ∗ [ since exp ( − Bx α ) ≈ 1 − Bx α for Bx α (cid:28) 1 ] . Further , we have also found at least an apparent t 7 / 8 power - law in the longitudinal MSD of the end - to - end vector , albeit with an almost insigniﬁcant amplitude wrt the overall ﬂuctuations of the end - to - end vector ( we cannot ascertain a true power - law behavior since we do not have an analytical derivation for t 7 / 8 ) . Further , Ref . [ 20 ] reports the orientational correlation function of the unit tangent vector at the middle of the chain , which is analogous to that of the orientation of the middle bond vector u m in our model . The corresponding result , translated in terms of u m would imply that (cid:104) [ u m ( t ) − u m ( 0 ) ] 2 (cid:105) = B 1 t 1 / 4 + B 2 t 1 / 2 , with B 1 and B 2 two N - dependent constants . The form of the term proportional to B 1 is consistent with the stretched exponential behavior ( 33 ) at t (cid:28) τ ∗ , but we do not ﬁnd any signature of an exponent 1 / 2 for (cid:104) [ u m ( t ) − u m ( 0 ) ] 2 (cid:105) in our result . It is of course possible that the t 1 / 2 behavior arises from the ( nonlinear ) longitudinal ﬂuctuations , which , in light of the longitudinal ﬂuctuations in the end - to - end vectors , we also expect to have an almost insigniﬁcant impact on the total ﬂuctuations in u m ( t ) . We have already shown results for N = 255 for dsDNA in one occasion ( 6 ) — an instance where we are able to simulate , at the basepair resolution , full chains of length more than twice the persistence length . Appendix A : The stretched exponentials derived from the mode - sums In this appendix we present some formulas that enable us to analyze C L ( t ) . We start with sums of the type F n ( τ ) = (cid:88) p = 3 , p n ζ tp [ 1 − exp ( − ζ tp τ ) ] ) , ( A1 ) The function F 0 ( τ ) is relevant for the auto - correlation function of the end - to - end vector and the mean squared displacement of the middle bead . The function F 2 ( τ ) is needed for the auto - correlation function of the middle bond , and for next to dominant contributions . The ﬁrst step is to replace the sum by an integral . The justiﬁcation comes from the fact that for small values of the exponent ( which is the case for τ ≤ τ ∗ = N 4 ) a large range of p - values 28 contribute , for which the integrand is smoothly varying . So , we approximate F 0 ( τ ) by F n ( τ ) (cid:39) 1 2 (cid:90) dpp n ζ tp [ 1 − exp ( − ζ tp τ ) ] ) , ( A2 ) Next we approximate ζ tp in the regime where the main contributions come from by ζ tp (cid:39) νπ 4 p 4 N 4 ( A3 ) and make the substitution p = N π ( ντ ) 1 / 4 q 1 / 4 , ( A4 ) which leads for F 0 ( τ ) to the integral F 0 ( τ ) (cid:39) Nτ 3 / 4 8 πν 1 / 4 (cid:90) dq q − 7 / 4 [ 1 − exp ( − q ) ] . ( A5 ) Integration by parts gives the result F 0 ( τ ) (cid:39) Nτ 3 / 4 6 πν 1 / 4 (cid:90) dq q − 3 / 4 exp ( − q ) = Nτ 3 / 4 6 πν 1 / 4 Γ ( 1 / 4 ) . ( A6 ) For F 2 ( τ ) the derivation is similar . Only the front factor and the power of τ diﬀer : F 2 ( τ ) (cid:39) N 3 τ 1 / 4 2 π 3 ν 3 / 4 Γ ( 3 / 4 ) . ( A7 ) In Section IV A the interplay between the front factors and the time dependence has been discussed with the result that times τ ∼ N 4 are most relevant for the exponent of the stretched exponential . As follows , one can see that the next order ∼ p 2 in the expansion of L p is dwarfed by Eq . ( A6 ) . The term has an extra factor N 2 in the denominator and gets another extra factor N 2 in the numerator as F 0 has to be replaced by F 2 ( with the second extra factor ) . But τ 3 / 4 in F 0 gives a factor N 3 for τ ∼ τ ∗ and τ 1 / 4 in F 2 gives a factor N . So the next term in the expansion is a factor N − 2 smaller than the dominant term . The contribution of the longitudinal modes cannot be observed for similar reasons . The analysis with the spectrum ζ lp ∼ ( p / N ) 2 gives the combination τ 1 / 2 N − 2 , which applies for times bounded by ( ζ l 1 ) ∼ N 2 . Hence , the combination τ 1 / 2 N − 2 remains very small in that time regime . 29 Appendix B : Adjustment of the reference groundstate In this appendix we discuss the adjustment of the reference groundstate such that the transverse mode p = 1 are kept equal to zero . The adjustment amounts to a rotation of the vectors r 0 n over an angle θ around an axis ˆ ω . With this ˆ ω and θ the set of reference axes ˆ e α are rotated to a system ˆ e Rα connected to the original ones by the matrix ˆ e Rα = (cid:88) β T α , β ˆ e β . ( B1 ) The matrix T α , β is related to the rotation ˆ ω , θ by T α , β = cos θ δ α , β + ( 1 − cos θ ) ω α ω β + sin θ ω α × β . ( B2 ) Here ω α is the component α of the vector ˆ ω . The index α × β means for α (cid:54) = β the next one in the periodic series 0 , 1 , 2 , 0 , 1 , . . . with ω β × α = − ω α × β . As ˆ ω is a unit vector one has the relation (cid:88) α ω 2 α = 1 . ( B3 ) There is no point of rotating the vectors r 0 n around their common direction , so we put ω 0 = 0 . The problem is to ﬁnd the two other components ω 1 and ω 2 which have the role to let the modes Ψ 11 and Ψ 21 vanish . First we derive the transformation of the components of the modes under a general rotation of the reference basis . Note that we rotate the reference basis but keep the positions of the monomers ﬁxed . As the longitudinal and transverse mode behave diﬀerently we treat them separately . According to ( 13 ) the longitudinal mode is related to the positions in the rotated reference systems as ( Ψ 0 p ) R = (cid:88) n (cid:2) r n · ˆ e R 0 − r 0 n (cid:3) φ ln , p = (cid:88) n (cid:34)(cid:88) β T 0 , β ( r n · ˆ e β ) − r 0 n (cid:35) φ ln , p . ( B4 ) We express , with ( 11 ) , the components of positions r n back into the modes of the original reference system r n · ˆ e β = r 0 n δ β , 0 + (cid:88) q φ βn , q Ψ βq . ( B5 ) The longitudinal and transverse eigenfunctions are orthogonal for the same type (cid:88) n φ ln , p φ ln , q = δ p , q (cid:88) n φ tn , p φ tn , q = δ p , q , ( B6 ) 30 but the mixed combination yields the matrix (cid:88) n φ ln , p φ tn , q = A p , q , ( B7 ) which is nearly diagonal and which has only even - even and odd - odd elements . So we get for the longitudinal modes ( Ψ 0 p ) R = √ I ( 1 − T 0 , 0 ) A p , 1 + T 0 , 0 Ψ 0 p + (cid:88) q , β = 1 , 2 T 0 , β A p , q Ψ βq . ( B8 ) We used for the summation over n the explicit form of the eigenfunction of the transverse mode p = 1 given in ( 9 ) . The transverse component transform according to ( for α (cid:54) = 0 ) ( Ψ αp ) R = (cid:88) n φ tn , p ( r n · ˆ e Rα ) = (cid:88) n φ tn , p (cid:88) β T α , β ( r n · ˆ e β ) . ( B9 ) For the inner product we ﬁnd r n · ˆ e β = δ β , 0 ( r 0 n + (cid:88) q φ ln , q Ψ 0 q ) + ( 1 − δ β . 0 ) (cid:88) q φ tn , q Ψ βq . ( B10 ) Inserting ( B10 ) into ( B9 ) yields , using ( 9 ) and ( B6 ) , ( Ψ αp ) R = T α , 0 (cid:32) −√ I δ p , 1 + (cid:88) q A p , q Ψ 0 q (cid:33) + (cid:88) β = 1 , 2 T α , β Ψ βp . ( B11 ) We get an equation for the components ω 1 and ω 2 by requiring that ( Ψ 11 ) R = ( Ψ 21 ) R = 0 . In order to make these equations explicit we introduce the combinations u = Ψ 11 √ I − (cid:80) q A p , q Ψ 0 q , v = Ψ 21 √ I − (cid:80) q A p , q Ψ 0 q . ( B12 ) u and v are parameters given by the modes before the rotation of the reference system . The equations for ω 1 and ω 2 thus obtain the form T 1 , 0 = T 1 , 1 u + T 1 , 2 v , T 2 , 0 = T 2 , 1 u + T 2 , 2 v . ( B13 ) These equations give the components ω 1 and ω 2 and the angle θ . With the rotation matrix ( B2 ) and ω 0 = 0 , we get the explicit equations   − sin θ ω 2 = ( 1 − cos θ ) ω 1 ( ω 1 u + ω 2 v ) + cos θ u , sin θ ω 1 = ( 1 − cos θ ) ω 2 ( ω 1 u + ω 2 v ) + cos θ v . ( B14 ) 31 Multiplying the ﬁrst equation with ω 1 and the second with ω 2 and adding them gives the equation ω 1 u + ω 2 v = 0 . ( B15 ) Together with the condition ( B3 ) one ﬁnds ω 0 = 0 , ω 1 = v √ u 2 + v 2 , ω 2 = − u √ u 2 + v 2 . ( B16 ) Inserting this into ( B14 ) yields the value of θ or sin θ = √ u 2 + v 2 √ 1 + u 2 + v 2 , cos θ = 1 √ 1 + u 2 + v 2 . ( B17 ) With these values the rotation matrix T α , β and the transformation ( B8 ) and ( B11 ) of the modes to the new reference system are determined . [ 1 ] C . Bustamante , J . F . Marko , E .
