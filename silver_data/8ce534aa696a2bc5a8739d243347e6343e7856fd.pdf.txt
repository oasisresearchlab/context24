Single - Molecule Speckle Analysis of Actin Filament Turnover in Lamellipodia Naoki Watanabe 1 * and Timothy J . Mitchison 1 , 2 Lamellipodia are thin , veil - like extensions at the edge of cells that contain a dynamic array of actin ﬁlaments . We describe an approach for analyzing spatial regulation of actin polymerization and depolymerization in vivo in which we tracked single molecules of actin fused to the green ﬂuorescent protein . Polymerization and the lifetime of actin ﬁlaments in lamellipodia were mea - sured with high spatial precision . Basal polymerization and depolymerization occurred throughout lamellipodia with largely constant kinetics , and polymer - ization was promoted within one micron of the lamellipodium tip . Most of the actin ﬁlaments in the lamellipodium were generated by polymerization away from the tip . Recent studies have opened up the biochem - istry underlying the dynamics and structural organization of actin in lamellipodia . Arp2 / 3 complex plays a key role in actin polymer - ization , promoting nucleation and dendritic organization of filaments ( 1 , 2 ) . Depolymer - ization is fast , and it may be coupled to polymerization ( 3 ) . The exact depolymeriza - tion mechanism is unknown , but cofilin is thought to play a central role ( 4 ) . Quantita - tive modeling of lamellipodium dynamics is a logical goal , but it will require detailed kinet - ic information on actin dynamics in vivo . Actin dynamics in live cells has been probed by two types of experiments . In time - resolved fixation experiments , incorporation of newly introduced actin subunits into poly - mers is followed ( 5 , 6 ) . In photoactivation and photobleaching experiments , redistribu - tion of fluorescence fused to actin is followed ( 7 – 10 ) . These live - cell studies are supple - mented by analysis of actin incorporation after permeabilization ( 6 , 11 ) . These studies highlight the dynamic nature of actin fila - 1 Department of Cell Biology and 2 Institute of Chem - istry and Cell Biology , Harvard Medical School , 240 Longwood Avenue , Boston , MA 02115 , USA . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

Subunit incorporation data have been interpreted as showing that polymerization is restricted to the lamellipo - dium tip ( 5 , 6 , 11 ) , whereas photoactivation data have been interpreted as revealing poly - merization throughout lamellipodia ( 8 ) . The data are inadequate to support quantitative modeling because of their limited spatial and temporal resolution . Actin depolymerization rates are probably underestimated by photo - activation and photobleaching experiments because of fast , local reincorporation of dis - assembled subunits in lamellipodia ( 12 , 13 ) . To address these deficiencies , we turned to fluorescent speckle imaging ( 14 ) , in which fluorescent tags incorporated at low concentrations provide fiduciary marks on polymers . To date , speckle analysis has followed clusters of 2 to 10 fluorochromes that happen to lie in the same resolvable unit in the image ( 15 ) . Because such clusters may include signals from multiple filaments , it has not been possible to directly infer the fila - ment turnover from speckle dynamics . Here , we used more diluted label with endogenous actin ( 1 : 10 , 000 to 1 : 50 , 000 ) ( 16 ) and fol - lowed speckles of single fluorescent actin molecules . Xenopus fibroblast ( XTC ) cells expressing " - actin fused to EGFP ( 17 ) were observed soon after being spread onto poly - L - lysine – coated glass coverslips . The enhancer of the cytomeg - alovirus immediate early promoter ( 18 ) in the plasmid was truncated to reduce the expression level ( 16 ) . XTC cells developed wide lamelli - podia firmly attached onto the substrate ( Fig . 1A ) . The thin architecture of lamellipodia , typ - ically # 0 . 2 ! m thick ( 19 ) , was evident from the distribution of untagged red fluorescent pro - teins ( RFP ) ( Fig . 1B ) . This allowed us to ob - serve all of the actin in a lamellipodium in a single focal plane . Several observations indicat - ed that EGFP - actin coassembled with cellular actin filaments and provided a nonperturbing probe of actin dynamics . EGFP - actin was effi - ciently incorporated into actin filament struc - tures without disturbing actin dynamics even when expressed at high levels [ Fig . 1B , Web movie 1 ( 16 ) ] . After monomeric pools were extracted ( 16 ) , the distribution of EGFP - actin was identical to phalloidin staining ( Fig . 1C ) . EGFP - actin expressed at low levels appeared as speckles that colocalized with actin filament structures ( Fig . 1D ) . These EGFP - actin signals remained tightly associated with actin filaments upon 1 M NaCl extraction , indicating their co - polymerization with cellular actin ( 16 ) . Rear - ward flow of the bulk actin network was appar - ent at the same speed of $ 1 . 5 ! m / min in cells expressing high and low levels of EGFP - actin [ Fig . 1E , Web movies 1 to 3 ( 16 ) ] . A key aspect of speckle imaging is that only immobilized probes give rise to discrete signals . If the diffusion constant of EGFP - actin monomer is of the same order as the actin monomer diffusion constant , $ 4 % 10 & 8 cm 2 / s ( 20 ) , monomeric probes travel through a path of ’ 2 ! m during the 2 - s exposure time , and signals will be blurred over many camera pixels . We verified this immobilization requirement by observing time - lapse images of untagged EGFP ex - pressed at a low level in cells , and we com - pared images before and after fixation ( Fig . 1F ) . Only diffuse signal was observed in live cells , although many speckles appeared after fixation . Because polymerization is the only known mechanism that immobilizes large amounts of actin , EGFP - actin will only give rise to speckles when copolymerized with cellular actin . To test whether each speckle visualized at very low expression levels consisted of a single EGFP - actin molecule , we tracked $ 800 indi - vidual speckles undergoing photobleaching , us - ing fixed cells to eliminate turnover due to filament disassembly . The kinetics of speckle disappearance matched the prediction that each speckle was a single EGFP - actin molecule ( 16 ) . The signal decay of individual speckles occurred by a sudden decrease down to back - ground ( 16 ) , again consistent with the predic - tion . In live - cell experiments , we restricted our analysis to speckles that had the characteristic signal intensity of single molecules and moved backward at the actin flux rate . Analysis of single - molecule speckles in live cells was carried out using cells ex - Fig . 2 . Actin depolymerization in lamellipodia .

To verify the accuracy of normalization for photobleaching , we carried out regression analysis using less - frequent image acquisition ( one per 20 s ) , and obtained a similar depolymerization rate , t 1 / 2 ( 24 s for untreated cells ( 16 ) .

R E P O R T S 8 FEBRUARY 2002 VOL 295 SCIENCE www . sciencemag . org 1084 pressing very low levels of EGFP - actin [ Fig . 2A , Web movie 3 ( 16 ) ] . We analyzed actin depolymerization by two methods . In the lifetime method , speckles were moni - tored from their emergence to their disap - pearance . In the regression method , a set of speckles was identified in one reference image , and the decrease in their numbers was followed over subsequent images . The regression results were analyzed by approx - imating with a single exponential curve and correcting for photobleaching ( Fig . 2B ) ( 16 ) . This method allowed us to measure rapid change in overall depolymerization rates within a single cell ( 21 ) . The half - life in lamellipodia averaged 30 s before , and 107 s after , treatment with 5 ! M jas - plakinolide ( Fig . 2C ) , an actin filament – stabilizing drug ( 22 ) . That this drug in - duced stabilization is consistent with our interpretation that disappearance of speck - les was due to depolymerization and not blinking of fluorescence ( 23 ) . The speckle lifetime method allowed measurement of lifetime distribution of ac - tin filaments . Speckle lifetimes spanned a wide range ( 4 to 148 sec ) , regardless of distance from the cell edge ( Fig . 2D ) . The average filament lifetime was almost uni - form across the lamellipodium , except for a reproducible 1 . 3 - to 1 . 6 - fold increase in the tip region . The lifetime distribution ( Fig . 2E ) had several interesting features . First , a large number of subunits ( 34 % ) were esti - mated to depolymerize within 8 s after polymerization , indicating that a lag before the start of depolymerization is of the order of seconds or less . Second , a fraction of subunits had prolonged lifetimes , although the size of this fraction might be inaccu - rately measured because of photobleaching . Currently , it is not known how depoly - merization starts and proceeds in the fila - ments . If depolymerization starts solely from pointed ends after Arp2 / 3 complex ( Arp2 / 3 ) dissociation ( 2 ) , our results require an Arp2 / 3 off - rate of 0 . 1 to 0 . 5 per second , faster than a value predictable from the high affinity of Arp2 / 3 for pointed ends ( 24 ) . ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release by filaments ( 25 ) , or by Arp2 / 3 , may promote Arp2 / 3 dissociation . Alternatively , depolymerization may occur after severing of filaments , catalyzed by co - filin ( 4 ) or gelsolin ( 26 ) . Tropomyosin protects filaments from severing ( 27 ) and could account for stabilization of long - lived filaments . Distribution of polymerization activity was measured by following the appearance of speckles , and comparing it with steady - state filament distribution ( Fig . 3 ) . These results revealed two distinct regions of actin poly - merization activity . A region within 1 ! m of the tip showed higher rates of new speckle formation per unit area than the rest of lamel - lipodia . In the rest of lamellipodia , new speckles emerged at a rate approximately proportional to the steady - state amount of actin filaments . These data are summarized in a phenome - nological model ( Fig . 4A ) . In the lamellipo - dium body , basal polymerization and depoly - merization occur with roughly constant kinet - ics , $ 3 % of bulk filaments per second . In the tip region , additional polymerization ( tip poly - merization ) is required , because filaments are constantly removed by backward actin flow . We assume that tip polymerization generates the new filament network at a rate proportional to a backward flow rate , 0 . 025 ! m / s . Then , the observed high polymerization rates in the tip Fig . 3 . Distribution of actin polymerization ac - tivity . ( A ) Comparisonof new speckle formation with phalloidin staining .

Phenomenological model of actin ﬁla - ment dynamics in lamellipodia . ( A ) Summary of actin speckle kinetics . Basal polymerization generates and depolymerization disassembles $ 3 % of the bulk ﬁlaments every second throughout the lamellipodium . In addition , po - lymerization is promoted within 1 ! m of the lamellipodium by tip polymerization that gen - erates ﬁlaments corresponding to new ﬁlament network formation associated with actin back - ward ﬂow . ( B ) Quantitative version of the phe - nomenological model . A representative total ﬁlament distribution ( red ) was obtained by av - eraging relative intensity of phalloidin staining in eight typical lamellipodia . Using the lifetime distribution ( Fig . 2 , D and E ) , a basal polymer - ization rate of 0 . 03 s & 1 of total ﬁlaments , and a backward actin ﬂow rate of 0 . 025 ! m / s , we modeled the contributions of the two polymer - ization mechanisms to the steady - state ﬁla - ment distribution ( 16 ) . Filaments generated by basal polymerization ( blue ) account for most of the ﬁlament distribution in lamellipodia , whereas ﬁlaments generated by tip polymer - ization ( green ) are predominant only in the tip region . The sum of tip and basal polymers ( dashed line ) is presented for comparison to the measured ﬁlament distribution ( red ) . R E P O R T S www . sciencemag . org SCIENCE VOL 295 8 FEBRUARY 2002 1085 region ( Fig . 3 ) could be attributed to the sum of basal and tip polymerization . We modeled rel - ative contribution of tip and basal polymeriza - tion to the measured steady - state filament dis - tribution ( Fig . 4B ) . Our results show that poly - merization away from the tip generates most of the actin filaments in lamellipodia , consistent with the rapid recovery kinetics of photoactiva - tion experiments ( 8 – 10 ) . These findings will need to be considered in the context of the specific geometric con - straints of the leading edge . Tip polymeriza - tion might be promoted by factors attached to the lamellipodium tip such as WAVE / Scar , VASP / Mena , and focal adhesion complexes ( 28 – 30 ) . Alternatively , tip polymerization could be governed by physical restriction , if the force between the filament end and the plasma membrane regulates filament elonga - tion ( 31 , 32 ) . Much less is known about how basal po - lymerization might be regulated , despite its dominant role in determining total filament distribution ( Fig . 4B ) . To accomplish fast basal polymerization , newly growing ends must be continuously generated in the lamel - lipodium body by some combination of nu - cleation , severing , uncapping , and shrinking to growing transitions . Such growing ends may affect leading - edge dynamics , extending filaments toward the lamellipodium tip . Po - tential regulatory mechanisms for basal poly - merization include uncapping by phosphoi - nositides ( 33 ) and severing by cofilin ( 34 ) . Single - molecule analysis of actin regulatory proteins should help determine the role of these pathways and deepen our understanding of the dynamic organization of actin arrays .

Decay rates of signals marked by photoactivation and photobleaching do not correspond with actin depo - lymerization rates at fast actin turnover rates ( g ) and at high polymer - to - monomer ratios of actin ( Cf : Cm ) ( 12 ) . From high concentration of ﬁlaments , $ 1000 ! M ( 20 ) , and our observations using the F - actin – preserving extraction method ( 16 ) , it was estimated that Cf : Cm might exceed 5 : 1 in lamellipodia . Simu - lation using the Tardy model ( 12 ) estimated that the decay rate of uncaged actin label was about one - half the depolymerization rate at Cf : Cm ( 5 , g ( 0 . 03 ( this study ) , and D ( 5 % 10 & 8 cm 2 / s ( 20 ) . 14 .

Bodary 2 The protein - protein interaction between leukocyte functional antigen – 1 ( LFA - 1 ) and intercellular adhesion molecule – 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) is critical to lymphocyte and immune system function . Here , we report on the transfer of the contiguous , nonlinear epitope of ICAM - 1 , responsible for its association with LFA - 1 , to a small - molecule framework . These LFA - 1 antagonists bound LFA - 1 , blocked binding of ICAM - 1 , and inhibited a mixed lymphocyte reaction ( MLR ) with potency signiﬁcantly greater than that of cyclosporine A . Furthermore , in comparison to an antibody to LFA - 1 , they exhibited signiﬁcant anti - inﬂam - matory effects in vivo . These results demonstrate the utility of small - molecule mimics of nonlinear protein epitopes and the protein epitopes themselves as leads in the identiﬁcation of novel pharmaceutical agents . The interaction of LFA - 1 ( the integrin ) L " 2 , CD11a / CD18 ) with the ICAM proteins 1 , 2 , and 3 is critical to the adhesion , extravasa - tion , migration , and proliferation of lympho - cytes ( 1 – 3 ) . Antibodies directed against the CD11a subunit of LFA - 1 , which block the binding of its native protein ligand , ICAM - 1 , have been shown to safely and effectively moderate lymphocyte function in various an - imal models of human diseases ( 4 – 6 ) . Hu - manized antibodies ( 7 ) have been advanced into clinical trials for the treatment of psori - asis and transplant rejection ( 8 , 9 ) . The safety and efficacy observed in these studies has validated LFA - 1 as a therapeutic target of interest to the pharmaceutical industry . An epitope comprising residues E34 , K39 , M64 , Y66 , N68 , and Q73 ( 10 ) within ICAM - 1’s first domain has been identified as essen - Departments of 1 Bioorganic Chemistry , 2 Immunology , 3 Protein Engineering , 4 Pathology , 5 Small Molecule Pharmacology , and 7 Antibody Technology , Genen - tech , One DNA Way , South San Francisco , CA 94080 , USA . 6 Roche Research Center , Hoffmann – La Roche , Nutley , NJ 07110 , USA . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .
