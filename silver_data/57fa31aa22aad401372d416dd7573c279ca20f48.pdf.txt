Here , we describe a pooled , loss - of - function genetic screening approach suitable for both positive and negative selection that uses a genome - scale lentiviral single guide RNA ( sgRNA ) library . sgRNA expression cassettes were stably integrated into the genome , which enabled a complex mutant pool to be tracked by massively parallel sequencing . We used a library containing 73 , 000 sgRNAs to generate knockout collections and performed screens in two human cell lines . A screen for resistance to the nucleotide analog 6 - thioguanine identified all expected members of the DNA mismatch repair pathway , while another for the DNA topoisomerase II ( TOP2A ) poison etoposide identified TOP2A , as expected , and also cyclin - dependent kinase 6 , CDK6 . A negative selection screen for essential genes identified numerous gene sets corresponding to fundamental processes . Finally , we show that sgRNA efficiency is associated with specific sequence motifs , enabling the prediction of more effective sgRNAs . Collectively , these results establish Cas9 / sgRNA screens as a powerful tool for systematic genetic analysis in mammalian cells . A critical need in biology is the ability to efficiently identify the set of genes underlying a cellular process . In microorganisms , powerful methods allow systematic loss - of - function genetic screening ( 1 , 2 ) . In mammalian cells , however , current screening methods fall short – primarily because of the difficulty of inactivating both copies of a gene in a diploid mammalian cell . Insertional mutagenesis screens in cell lines that are near - haploid or carry Blm mutations , that cause frequent somatic crossing - over , have proven powerful but are not applicable to most cell lines and suffer from integration biases of the insertion vectors ( 3 , 4 ) . The primary solution has been to target mRNAs with RNA interference ( RNAi ) ( 5 – 9 ) . However , this approach is also imperfect as it only partially suppresses target gene levels and can have off - target effects on other mRNAs – resulting in false negative and false * Correspondence should be addressed to : sabatini @ wi . mit . edu ( D .

Thus , there remains an unmet need for an efficient , large - scale , loss of function screening method in mammalian cells Recently , the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ( CRISPR ) pathway , which functions as an adaptive immune system in bacteria ( 13 ) , has been co - opted to engineer mammalian genomes in an efficient manner ( 14 – 16 ) . In this two - component system , a single guide RNA ( sgRNA ) directs the Cas9 nuclease to cause double - stranded cleavage of matching target DNA sequences ( 17 ) . In contrast to previous genome - editing techniques , such as zinc - finger nucleases and TALENs , the target specificity of CRISPR / Cas9 is dictated by a 20 - base pair sequence at the 5 ′ - end of the sgRNA , allowing for much greater ease of construction of knockout reagents . Mutant cells lines and mice bearing multiple modified alleles can be generated with this technology ( 18 , 19 ) . We set out to explore the feasibility of using the CRISPR / Cas9 system to perform large - scale , loss - of - function screens in mammalian cells . The idea was to use a pool of sgRNA - expressing lentivirus to generate a library of knockout cells that could be screened under both positive and negative selection . Each sgRNA would serve as a distinct DNA barcode that can be used to count the number of cells carrying it using high - throughput sequencing ( Fig . 1A ) . Pooled screening requires that single - copy sgRNA integrants are sufficient to induce efficient cleavage of both copies of a targeted locus . This contrasts with the high expression of sgRNAs achieved by transfection that is typically used to engineer a specific genomic change using the CRISPR / Cas9 system . We first tested the concept in the near - haploid , human KBM7 CML cell line , by creating a clonal derivative expressing the Cas9 nuclease ( with a FLAG - tag at its N - terminus ) under a doxycycline - inducible promoter ( Fig . 1B ) . Transduction of these cells at low multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) with a lentivirus expressing a sgRNA targeting the endogenous AAVS1 locus revealed substantial cleavage at the AAVS1 locus 48 hours after infection ( Fig . 1C ) . Moreover , because the sgRNA was stably expressed , genomic cleavage continued to increase over the course of the experiment . Deep sequencing of the locus revealed that repair of Cas9 - induced double - strand breaks resulted in small deletions ( < 20 bp ) in the target sequence , with tiny insertions or substitutions ( < 3 bp ) occurring at a lower frequency ( Fig . 1D ) . The vast majority of the lesions , occurring in a protein - coding region , would be predicted to give rise to a nonfunctional protein product , indicating that CRISPR / Cas9 is an efficient means of generating loss - of - function alleles . We also analyzed off - target activity of CRISPR / Cas9 . Although the specificity of CRISPR / Cas9 has been extensively characterized in transfection - based settings ( 20 – 22 ) , we wanted to examine its off - target behavior in our system , where Cas9 and a single guide RNA targeting AAVS1 ( sgAAVS1 ) were stably expressed for two weeks . We compared the level of cleavage observed at the target locus ( 97 % ) to levels at 13 potential off - target cleavage sites in the genome ( defined as sites differing by up to 3 bp from sgAAVS1 ) . Minimal cleavage ( < 2 . 5 % ) was observed at all sites with one exception , which was the only site that had perfect complementarity in the ‘seed’ region ( terminal 8 bp ) . On average , sgRNAs have ~ 2 . 2 such sites in the genome , almost always ( as in this case ) occurring in non - coding DNA and thus less likely to affect gene function ( Note S1 ) . To test the ability to simultaneously screen tens of thousands of sgRNAs , we designed a sgRNA library with 73 , 151 members , consisting of multiple sgRNAs targeting 7 , 114 genes and 100 non - targeting controls ( Methods , Fig . 1E , Table S1 ) . sgRNAs were designed against constitutive coding exons near the beginning of each gene and filtered for potential off - target effects based on sequence similarity to the rest of the human genome ( Fig . 1 , F and G ) . The library included 10 sgRNAs for each of 7033 genes and all possible sgRNAs for Wang et al . Page 2 Science . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 July 03 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t each of the 84 genes encoding ribosomal proteins ( Fig . 1H ) . To assess the effective representation of our microarray synthesized library , we sequenced sgRNA barcodes from KBM7 cells 24 hours after infection with the entire lentiviral pool and were able to detect the overwhelming majority ( > 99 % ) of our sgRNAs , with high uniformity across constructs ( only 6 - fold increase in abundance between the 10 th and 90 th percentiles ) ( Fig . S2A ) . As an initial test of our approach , we screened the library for genes that function in DNA mismatch repair ( MMR ) . In the presence of the nucleotide analog 6 - thioguanine ( 6 - TG ) , MMR - proficient cells are unable to repair 6 - TG - induced lesions and arrest at the G2 - M cell - cycle checkpoint , while MMR - defective cells do not recognize the lesions and continue to divide ( 23 ) . We infected Cas9 - KBM7 cells with the entire sgRNA library , cultured the cells in a concentration of 6 - TG that is lethal to wild - type KBM7 cells , and sequenced the sgRNA barcodes in the final population . sgRNAs targeting the genes encoding the four components of the MMR pathway ( MSH2 , MSH6 , MLH1 and PMS2 ) ( 24 ) were dramatically enriched in the 6 - TG - treated cells . At least four independent sgRNAs for each gene showed very strong enrichment and barcodes corresponding to these genes made up > 30 % of all barcodes ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Strikingly , each of the twenty most abundant sgRNAs targeted one of these four genes . The fact that few of the other 73 , 000 sgRNAs scored highly in this assay suggests a low frequency of off - target effects . We next addressed the challenge of loss of function screening in diploid cells , which require bi - allelic inactivation of a target gene . We therefore generated an inducible Cas9 derivative of the HL60 pseudo - diploid human leukemic cell line . In both HL60 and KBM7 cells , we screened for genes whose loss conferred resistance to etoposide , a chemotherapeutic agent that poisons DNA topoisomerase IIA ( TOP2A ) . To identify hit genes , we calculated the difference in abundance between the treated and untreated populations for each sgRNA , calculated a score for each gene by using a Kolmogorov - Smirnov test to compare the sgRNAs targeting the gene against the non - targeting control sgRNAs , and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing ( Fig . 2 , C to E , Table S2 ) . Identical genes were detected in both screens , with significance levels exceeding all other genes by more than 100 - fold . As expected , loss of TOP2A itself conferred strong protection to etoposide ( 25 ) . The screen also revealed a role for CDK6 , a G1 cyclin - dependent kinase , in mediating etoposide - induced cytotoxicity . Notably , every one of the 20 sgRNAs in the library targeting TOP2A or CDK6 was strongly enriched ( > 90 th percentile ) in both screens , indicating that the effective coverage of our libraries is very high . We generated isogenic HL60 cell lines with individual sgRNAs against TOP2A and CDK6 and , consistent with the screen results , these lines were much more resistant to etoposide than parental or sgAAVS1 - modified HL60 cells ( Fig . 2 , F and G ) . Thus , our Cas9 / sgRNA system enables large - scale positive selection loss - of - function screens . To identify genes required for cellular proliferation we screened for genes whose loss conferred a selective disadvantage on cells . Such a screen requires accurate identification of sgRNAs that are depleted from the final cell population . Importantly , a sgRNA will show depletion only if cleavage of the target gene occurs in the majority of cells carrying the construct . As an initial test , we screened KBM7 cells with a small library containing sgRNAs targeting the BCR and ABL1 genes ( Table S3 ) . The survival of KBM7 cells depends on the fusion protein produced by the BCR - ABL translocation ( 26 ) . As expected , depletion was seen only for sgRNAs targeting the exons of BCR and ABL 1 that encode the fusion protein , but not for those targeting the other exons of BCR and ABL1 ( Fig . 3A ) . Wang et al . Page 3 Science . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 July 03 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t We then infected Cas9 - HL60 , Cas9 - KBM7 , and WT KBM7 cells with the entire 73 , 000 - member sgRNA library and used deep sequencing of the sgRNA barcodes to monitor the change in abundance of each sgRNA between the initial seeding and a final population obtained after twelve cell doublings ( Fig . S2 , A and B ) . We began by analyzing ribosomal proteins genes , for which the library contained all possible sgRNAs . We observed strong Cas9 - dependent depletion of sgRNAs targeting genes encoding ribosomal proteins , with good concordance between the sets of ribosomal protein genes essential for cell proliferation in the HL60 and KBM7 screens ( the median sgRNA fold - change in abundance was used as a measure of gene essentiality ) ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . Interestingly , a few ribosomal protein genes were not found to be essential . These were two genes encoded on chromosome Y ( RPS4Y2 , which is testes - specific ( 27 ) , and RPS4Y1 , which is expressed at low levels compared to its homolog RPS4X on chromosome X ( 28 ) ) , and ‘ribosome - like’ proteins , which may be required only in select tissues ( 27 ) and generally are lowly expressed in KBM7 cells ( Fig . S3A ) . We then turned our attention to other genes within our dataset , for which ten sgRNAs were designed . As for the ribosomal genes , the essentiality scores of these genes were also strongly correlated between the two cells lines ( Fig . S3B , Table S4 ) . For the twenty highest scoring genes , we found independent evidence for essentiality , based primarily on data from large - scale functional studies in model organisms ( Table S5 ) . To evaluate the results at a global level , we tested 4722 gene sets to see if they showed strong signatures of essentiality , using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( 29 ) . Gene sets related to fundamental biological processes – including DNA replication , gene transcription , and protein degradation – showed strong depletion , consistent with their essentiality ( Fig . 3D , Table S6 ) . Finally , we sought to understand the features underlying sgRNA efficacy . Although the vast majority of sgRNAs against ribosomal protein genes showed depletion , detailed comparison of sgRNAs targeting the same gene revealed substantial variation in the precise amounts of depletion . These differences are unlikely to be caused by local accessibility to the Cas9 / sgRNA complex inasmuch as comparable variability was observed even among sgRNAs targeting neighboring target sites of a given gene ( Fig . S4A ) . Given that our library includes all possible sgRNAs against each of the 84 ribosomal genes , the data allowed us to search for factors that might explain the differential efficacy of sgRNAs . Because the majority of ribosomal proteins genes are essential , we reasoned that the level of depletion of a given ribosomal protein - targeting sgRNA could serve as a proxy for its cleavage efficiency . Applying this approach , we found several trends related to sgRNA efficacy : ( 1 ) Single guide sequences with very high or low GC content were less effective against their targets . ( 2 ) sgRNAs targeting the last coding exon were less effective than those targeting earlier exons , consistent with the notion that disruption of the terminal exon would be expected to have less impact on gene function . ( 3 ) sgRNAs targeting the transcribed strand were less effective than those targeting the non - transcribed strand ( Fig . 3E ) . Although these trends were statistically significant , they explained only a small proportion of differences in sgRNA efficacy ( Table S7 ) . We hypothesized that differences in sgRNA efficacy might also result from sequence features governing interactions with Cas9 . To test this , we developed a method to profile the sgRNAs directly bound to Cas9 in a highly parallel manner ( Methods ) . By comparing the abundance of sgRNAs bound to Cas9 relative to the abundance of their corresponding genomic integrants , we found that the nucleotide composition near the 3 ′ - end of the spacer sequence was the most important determinant of Cas9 loading ( Fig . 3F ) . Specifically , Cas9 Wang et al . Page 4 Science . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 July 03 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t preferentially bound sgRNAs containing purines in the last 4 nucleotides of the spacer sequence whereas pyrimidines were disfavored . A similar pattern emerged when we examined depletion of ribosomal protein - targeting sgRNAs ( r = 0 . 81 ) , suggesting that , in significant part , the cleavage efficiency of a sgRNA was determined by its affinity for Cas9 ( Table S7 ) . We then sought to build an algorithm to discriminate between strong and weak sgRNAs ( Fig . 3G ) . We trained a support - vector - machine classifier based on the target sequences and depletion scores of ribosomal protein - targeting single guide RNAs . As an independent test , we used the classifier to predict the efficacy of sgRNAs targeting the 400 top scoring ( i . e . essential ) non - ribosomal genes . The top two - thirds of our predictions exhibited 3 - fold higher efficacy than the remaining fraction , confirming the accuracy of the algorithm . Using this algorithm , we designed a whole - genome sgRNA library consisting of sequences predicted to have higher efficacy ( Table S8 ) . As with the sgRNA pool used in our screens , this new collection was also filtered for potential off - target matches . This reference set of sgRNAs may be useful both for targeting single genes as well as large - scale sgRNA screening . Taken together , these results demonstrate the utility of CRISPR / Cas9 for conducting large - scale genetic screens in mammalian cells . Based on our initial experiments , this system appears to offer several powerful features that together provide significant advantages over current functional screening methods . First , CRISPR / Cas9 inactivates genes at the DNA level , making it possible to study phenotypes that require a complete loss of gene function to be elicited . In addition , the system should also enable functional interrogation of non - transcribed elements , which are inaccessible by RNAi . Second , a large proportion of sgRNAs successfully generate mutations at their target sites . While this parameter is difficult to directly assess in pooled screens , we can obtain an estimate by examining the ‘hit rate’ at known genes . Applying a z - score analysis of our positive selection screens , we find that over 75 % ( 46 / 60 ) of sgRNAs score at a significance threshold that perfectly separates true and false positives on a gene level ( Fig . S5 , A to D ) . Together these results show that the effective coverage of our library is very high and that the rate of false negatives should be low even in a large - scale screen . Third , off - target effects do not appear to seriously hamper our screens , based on several lines of evidence . Direct sequencing of potential off - target loci detected minimal cleavage at secondary sites , which typically reside in non - coding regions and do not impact gene function . Moreover , in the 6 - TG screens , the twenty most abundant sgRNAs all targeted one of the four members of the MMR pathway . In total , they represented over 30 % of the final pool , a fraction greater the next 400 sgRNAs combined . In the etoposide screen , the two top genes scored far above background levels ( p - values 100 - fold smaller than the next best gene ) , enabling clear discrimination between true and false positive hits . Lastly , new versions of the CRISPR / Cas9 system have recently been developed that substantially decrease off - target activity ( 30 , 31 ) . Although we limited our investigation to proliferation - based phenotypes , our approach can be applied to a much wider range of biological phenomena . With appropriate sgRNA libraries , the method should enable genetic analyses of mammalian cells to be conducted with a degree of rigor and completeness currently possible only in the study of microorganisms .

Negative selection screens using CRISPR / Cas9 reveal rules governing sgRNA efficacy ( A ) Selective depletion of sgRNAs targeting exons of BCR and ABL1 present in the fusion protein . Individual sgRNAs are plotted according to their target sequence position along each gene and the height of each bar indicates the level of depletion observed . Boxes indicate individual exons . ( B ) Cas9 - dependent depletion of sgRNAs targeting ribosomal proteins . Cumulative distribution function plots of log 2 fold changes in sgRNA abundance before and after twelve cell doublings in Cas9 - KBM7 , Cas9 - HL60 and WT - KBM7 cells . ( C ) Requirement of similar sets of ribosomal protein genes for proliferation in the HL60 and KBM7 cells . Gene scores are defined as the median log 2 fold change of all sgRNAs targeting a gene . ( D ) Depleted sgRNAs target genes involved in fundamental biological processes . Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed on genes ranked by their combined depletion scores from screens in HL60 and KBM7 cells . Vertical lines underneath the x - axis denote members of the gene set analyzed . ( E ) Features influencing sgRNA efficacy . Depletion ( log 2 fold change ) of sgRNAs targeting ribosomal protein genes was used as an indicator of sgRNA efficacy . Correlation between log 2 fold changes and spacer % GC content ( left ) , exon position targeted ( middle ) and strand targeted ( right ) are depicted . ( * p < 0 . 05 ) ( F ) sgRNA target sequence preferences for Cas9 loading and cleavage efficiency . Position - specific nucleotide preferences for Cas9 loading are determined by counting sgRNAs bound to Cas9 normalized to the number of corresponding genomic integrations . Heatmaps depict sequence - dependent variation in Cas9 loading ( top ) and ribosomal protein gene - targeting sgRNA depletion ( bottom ) . The color scale represents the median value ( of Cas9 affinity or log 2 fold - change ) for all sgRNAs with the specified nucleotide at the specified position . ( G ) sgRNA efficacy prediction .
