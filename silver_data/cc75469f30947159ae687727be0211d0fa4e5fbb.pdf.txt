Low FLC expression underpins rapid - cycling and is established through a 28 transcription - coupled chromatin mechanism . Proximal termination of antisense transcripts is linked to 29 histone 3 lysine 4 demethylation of adjacent chromatin that leads to stable Polycomb Repressive 30 Complex 2 ( PRC2 ) silencing . However , how the termination - induced chromatin environment 31 influences the switch to PRC2 silencing is still unclear . Here , we combine molecular approaches with 32 theory to develop a dynamic mathematical model that incorporates sense / antisense transcription , 33 alternative termination sites , and the interplay of these processes with varying levels of activating 34 ( H3K4me1 ) / silencing ( H3K27me3 ) histone modifications . The model captures different feedback 35 2 mechanisms between co - transcriptional 3’ processing and chromatin modifications , detailing how 36 proximal co - transcriptional polyadenylation / termination can set the subsequent level of productive 37 transcription via removal of H3K4 monomethylation across the locus . Since transcription universally 38 antagonizes Polycomb silencing , this dictates the degree of antagonism to H3K27me3 , thus 39 determining the rate at which Polycomb repression is established . These principles are likely to be 40 central to regulating transcriptional output at many targets and generally relevant for Polycomb 41 silencing in many genomes . 42 43 Introduction 44 Transcriptional regulation is often mediated by chromatin states that are key to developmental 45 changes and environmental responses in many organisms . These chromatin states are characterised by 46 histone modifications , and trans - factors that recognise these modifications , which together determine 47 the level of productive transcription . Such chromatin states can be heritable across DNA replication 48 and mitosis , with controlled switching of key developmental loci between active and silenced states 49 underpinning the changes in gene expression programs that drive differentiation . 50 51 These inheritance mechanisms include read - write reinforcement of existing histone modifications and 52 antagonism between transcription and repressive modifications ( Berry et al . , 2017 ; Dodd et al . , 2007 ; 53 Holoch et al . , 2021 ) . Such mechanisms can be bistable producing all or nothing ( ON or OFF ) 54 transcriptional activity ( Berry et al . , 2017 ; Pease et al . , 2021 ) . Each gene copy can be stably 55 maintained in either an ON or OFF state even in dividing cells and can be autonomously switched 56 between states . The population level gene expression is then determined by the fraction of copies in 57 the ON state ( Alamos et al . , 2021 ; Antoniou - Kourounioti et al . , 2023 ; Berry et al . , 2015 ; Ng et al . , 58 2018 ; Saxton and Rine , 2022 ; Siwek et al . , 2020 ) . 59 60 We have studied this mode of regulation at the Arabidopsis floral repressor gene FLOWERING 61 LOCUS C ( FLC ) . Most well - known is the winter - induced silencing of FLC by PRC2 . The winter 62 cold - induced epigenetic silencing is an ON / OFF cell - autonomous , stochastic switching of individual 63 FLC copies into a Polycomb silenced state ( Fig . 1A ) ( Angel et al . , 2011 ; Berry et al . , 2015 ; Csorba et 64 al . , 2014 ; Lövkvist and Howard , 2021 ; Menon et al . , 2021 ) . In this process , the silencing histone 65 modification H3K27me3 is deposited at a specific intragenic site during the cold , followed by 66 spreading of H3K27me3 across the locus through a cell - cycle dependent mechanism during growth 67 after cold . 68 69 Fundamentally different to the cis - mediated ON / OFF mode is regulation of gene expression in a 70 graded manner ( Fig . 1A ) . Such a graded level can be set by the concentration ( Giorgetti et al . , 2010 ; 71 Lammers et al . , 2020 ) or activation strength of transcription factors ( Mamrak et al . , 2022 ) , 72 3 conceptually similar to how a dimmer can control the intensity of a light . These analogue mechanisms 73 mainly function in trans , with approximately uniform expression at each gene copy . This type of 74 analogue mechanism also occurs at FLC to set the quantitative expression level that determines 75 reproductive strategy . Low expression is established in a mechanism involving the RNA binding 76 protein FCA , which promotes proximal termination of FLC sense transcription in the developing 77 embryo ( Schon et al . , 2021 ) , and of antisense transcription in the seedling ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Also 78 essential is FLD , a plant homologue of the conserved histone K4 demethylase LSD1 ( Martignago et 79 al . , 2019 ) . Utilising an allelic series for fca , together with quantitative imaging , we showed that this 80 FCA - regulated , transcription - coupled mechanism can generate a graded , analogue regulation of FLC 81 expression ( Antoniou - Kourounioti et al . , 2023 ) . 82 83 This analogue mechanism is a prelude for a PRC2 - dependent digital ON / OFF expression switch that 84 occurs at different frequencies in different fca alleles ( Fig . 1B ) ( Antoniou - Kourounioti et al . , 2023 ) . 85 The key question we therefore set out to answer in the work described here is how factors that 86 mediate the analogue mode of FLC regulation ( 3’ co - transcriptional processing machinery linked to 87 histone H3K4 demethylation ( Fang et al . , 2020 ) ) feed into the Polycomb ON / OFF digital mode of 88 regulation . Such transcription - coupled mechanisms have been implicated in the establishment of 89 chromatin states in many organisms , through 3’ processing and non - coding RNA . A recent study 90 indicates a wide - ranging role for 3’ processing in heterochromatin establishment in S . pombe 91 ( Shimada et al . , 2021 ) . For example , Clr4 - mediated heterochromatin assembly by the RNAi - 92 independent pathway involves non - canonical polyadenylation and 3’ processing factors 93 ( Chalamcharla et al . , 2015 ; Tucker et al . , 2016 ; Vo et al . , 2019 ) . Transcription termination at non - 94 canonical sites mediated by the conserved cleavage and polyadenylation factor ( CPF ) and the RNA - 95 binding protein Mmi1 have been shown to be necessary for Clr4 - driven assembly of facultative 96 heterochromatin at meiotic and environmental response genes . Another RNA binding protein , Seb1 , 97 has been shown to promote heterochromatin formation , through a mechanism linked to termination of 98 noncoding transcription ( Marina et al . , 2013 ; Wittmann et al . , 2017 ) . Nevertheless , the exact 99 mechanisms linking RNA termination / processing and chromatin regulation are still poorly 100 understood . 101 102 Here , using mathematical modelling combined with molecular approaches , we elucidate the 103 interactions between co - transcriptional processing and chromatin regulation that underpin 104 transcription - coupled repression leading to Polycomb - mediated low expression of FLC . Specifically , 105 the model describes sense and antisense transcription , alternative transcriptional termination , the 106 dynamics of activating ( H3K4me1 ) and silencing ( H3K27me ) modifications , and the interactions 107 between these components ( Fig . 1C , D ) . We constrained the model using existing experimental data 108 and showed that it can successfully generate intermediate transcriptional outputs at non - Polycomb 109 4 silenced FLC copies ( analogue regulation ) , while also allowing Polycomb nucleation to occur slowly 110 over time ( digital switch ) . We then used the model to predict changes in activating H3K4me1 and 111 silencing H3K27me3 modifications at FLC over time and validated these predictions over a 112 developmental time - course . The model clearly elaborates the steps and feedbacks in how FCA / FLD - 113 mediated transcription - coupled repression , induced by co - transcriptional processing steps , described 114 in the accompanying paper ( Mateo - Bonmatí et al . , 2023 ) , influence the timing of the digital switch to 115 Polycomb silencing . The combination of molecular genetics and the theoretical modelling described 116 here provide a quantitative description of how co - transcriptional processing sets transcriptional states 117 that determine rates of Polycomb silencing , a mechanism that is likely to be generally relevant in 118 many organisms . 119 120 Results 121 Molecular network governing the FLC transcription - coupled chromatin repression pathway 122 123 The RNA binding protein FCA promotes proximal polyadenylation / termination at many targets in the 124 Arabidopsis genome ( Sonmez et al . , 2011 ) . FCA is known to directly interact in vivo with FY , a 125 CPSF component needed for silencing homologous to yeast Pfs2 and mammalian WDR33 ( Simpson 126 et al . , 2003 ) . FCA also indirectly interacts with other cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factors 127 ( Fang et al . , 2019 ) , as well as the 3’ processing factors CstF64 and CstF77 ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . FCA - 128 mediated silencing also requires the involvement of CDKC2 , a component of the transcription 129 elongation factor P - TEFb ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) , as well as the core spliceosome component PRP8 130 ( Marquardt et al . , 2014 ) , suggesting it is the process of transcription and proximal termination , rather 131 than just the transcripts themselves , that drive silencing . 132 133 The fate of the proximally polyadenylated transcripts is different dependent on which strand is being 134 transcribed . The FLC sense proximal transcripts are detectable in young embryos ( Schon et al . , 2021 ) 135 but less so in vegetative tissue , likely due to rapid nascent RNA turnover . In contrast , the FLC 136 antisense RNAs transcribed from the 3’ end of FLC ( collectively called COOLAIR ) , which are 137 alternatively polyadenylated ( PA ) at a proximal PA site within the FLC gene or a distal PA site in the 138 vicinity of the FLC promoter ( Liu et al . , 2010 ; Swiezewski et al . , 2009 ) , are both relatively stable . 139 The mechanism underlying the differential turnover of proximally polyadenylated transcripts is 140 currently unknown , but differential fates of coding and non - coding transcripts are not uncommon 141 ( Nojima and Proudfoot , 2022 ) . 142 143 To further test the antisense transcript role we examined FLC repression in an FCA overexpression 144 line , comparing expression of a wild - type FLC transgene ( FLC - 15 ) , with that of an FLC transgene 145 5 where the antisense promoter has been replaced - TEX 1 . 0 ( Csorba et al . , 2014 ) . The FLC repression 146 observed for the wild - type FLC transgene is significantly attenuated ~ 10 fold in TEX 1 . 0 , supporting a 147 role for antisense transcription in FCA - mediated silencing ( Fig . 2A ) . Similar results were found using 148 a CRISPR deletion of the antisense promoter at the endogenous FLC locus ( Zhao et al . , 2021 ) . The 149 remaining repression of FLC silencing by the defective antisense lines raised the question of the 150 importance of FCA - mediated proximal termination of FLC sense transcription . We therefore analysed 151 production of sense polyadenylated FLC transcripts by Quant - seq ( Moll et al . , 2014 ) . Proximally 152 polyadenylated transcripts for the FLC transcript were detected for all genotypes analysed ( Fig . 2B ) , 153 although levels were very low , potentially due to differential fates of coding / non - coding transcripts 154 described above . The sites of proximal termination in seedlings were similar to those reported in 155 embryos ( Schon et al . , 2021 ) . Altogether these data support a model whereby FCA - mediated proximal 156 termination of both sense and antisense transcription contributes to repression of FLC transcription . 157 158 FLC silencing mediated by FCA requires the protein FLD , a homologue of the mammalian H3K4 / K9 159 demethylase LSD1 ( Liu et al . , 2007 ) . FLD is thought to demethylate H3K4me1 in Arabidopsis 160 ( Inagaki et al . , 2021 ; Martignago et al . , 2019 ) . FLD has been shown to associate in vivo with the SET 161 domain protein SDG26 , which interacts with FY , indicating a physical link between processing of 162 antisense transcripts and chromatin remodelling ( Fang et al . , 2020 ) . FLD also stoichiometrically 163 associates in vivo with LD , a TFII - S domain containing protein and homolog of the CPSF 164 phosphatase subunit , PNUTS in human and Ref2 in yeast . This strong association of chromatin 165 remodelers such as FLD with RNA Pol II regulators shown in the accompanying paper , identifies a 166 mechanism where FCA - mediated proximal cleavage and polyadenylation triggers FLD - mediated 167 removal of H3K4me1 ( Mateo - Bonmatí et al . , 2023 ) . Removal of H3K4me1 then further affects co - 168 transcriptional splicing of sense and antisense transcription , potentially via reduced H3K36me3 , 169 whose methyltransferase SDG8 recognises H3K4me1 . This could in turn promote further early 170 transcription termination in a feedback loop . 171 172 What determines the polyadenylation site choice ? At FLC , this has been easiest to address via 173 COOLAIR processing , given the likely rapid turnover of sense proximally polyadenylated transcripts . 174 FCA is proposed to recognize any situation where RNA Pol II has stalled and transcription 175 termination is required to clear a ‘tangle’ in the chromatin prior to replication ( Baxter et al . , 2021 ; Xu 176 et al . , 2021 ) . The above molecular mechanisms and possible feedback interaction are summarised in 177 the schematic shown in Fig . 1C . 178 Computational model of FLC chromatin silencing through alternative termination 179 180 The stable silenced state of FLC eventually generated by this co - transcriptional repression mechanism 181 is a Polycomb silenced state , with the locus covered by H3K27me3 ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) . This is 182 6 consistent with genetic analysis indicating that the plant Polycomb methyltransferase CURLY LEAF 183 ( CLF ) is essential for FCA - mediated silencing of FLC ( Fang et al . , 2020 ) . However , despite the 184 detailed molecular data on 3’ processing - mediated silencing described above , and in the 185 accompanying paper ( Mateo - Bonmatí et al . , 2023 ) , it remains unclear how the various elements fit 186 together to generate a transition into Polycomb silencing . To bridge this gap , we therefore constructed 187 a computational model based on the above features ( Fig . 1D ) . We then combined this model with our 188 prior knowledge of Polycomb dynamics , which is known to generate digital ON / OFF memory states 189 ( Fig . 3A ) . We then used this model to dissect the underlying mechanism of the transition elucidating 190 how such digital silencing might be integrated into FCA - mediated 3’ processing . Note that our 191 previous model ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) also analysed transcription of the repressed state , which revealed 192 reduced initiation and slower elongation ; however , it did not address the mechanism of switching into 193 silencing . Important features of the new model are described below : 194 195 The model includes both activating and repressive histone modifications across the FLC locus , 196 specifically activating H3K4me1 and repressive H3K27me2 / me3 , which are mutually exclusive on 197 the same H3 tail . The model also incorporates sense and antisense transcription events at the locus , 198 where the frequency for both ( representing either transcription initiation or transition to elongation ) is 199 determined by the overall coverage of repressive H3K27me3 . Activating H3K4me1 modifications are 200 added co - transcriptionally , with higher overall coverage of H3K4me1 across the locus promoting 201 distal termination of transcription ( as proposed above ) . Proximal termination of both sense and 202 antisense transcription can then mediate removal of H3K4me1 , in line with the potential function of 203 FLD as a demethylase . The model also describes deposition of H3K27me by Polycomb in the FLC 204 nucleation region . H3K27me spreads to the rest of the locus through interactions with the nucleation 205 region , through well - characterised read - write feedback interactions . Experimental evidence indicates 206 the existence of a gene loop mediating an interaction between the 5’ and 3’ ends of FLC : this 207 interaction is also captured in the model . Finally , in line with experimental evidence from mammalian 208 systems and previously developed models for Polycomb , the model assumes that productive 209 transcription promotes removal of H3K27me through both histone exchange and co - transcriptional 210 demethylation . Full details of the model can be found in the Methods and Supporting Information . 211 Quantitative modulation of transcriptional output influences the timing of the digital ON / OFF 212 Polycomb switch 213 214 We have previously experimentally analysed FLC expression using an allelic series of fca mutants 215 ( Antoniou - Kourounioti et al . , 2023 ; Koornneef et al . , 1991 ) . These mutants show a range of FLC 216 expression ( assayed through a Col - 0 FLC - Venus transgene ) at the whole plant level , ranging from 217 low in the parental Landsberg erecta ( L er ) genotype , through higher expression levels in an 218 7 intermediate fca - 3 mutant , to a null fca - 1 mutant with the highest FLC expression ( Antoniou - 219 Kourounioti et al . , 2023 ) . Expression at the single cell level in root meristematic cells had been 220 measured both by quantification of FLC mRNA using single molecule fluorescence in situ 221 hybridization ( smFISH ) and of FLC protein by confocal imaging of Venus tagged FLC ( Antoniou - 222 Kourounioti et al . , 2023 ) . This analysis highlighted that the differences in overall expression between 223 the three genotypes appeared to have two components – a digital ON / OFF mode where we observed 224 clear differences in the number of FLC OFF cells , and an analogue mode , with quantitatively different 225 levels of FLC in the ON cells , where , for example , fca - 3 ON cells express less than fca - 1 ON cells 226 ( Fig . 1B ) . The intermediate expression level in fca - 3 , was associated with a slower switch off over 227 time into the digital OFF state . Importantly , we also observed similar behaviour of FLC expression in 228 single cells for a different intermediate mutant of FCA , called fca - 4 ( Fig . S5 and ( Antoniou - 229 Kourounioti et al . , 2023 ) ) , showing effects were not allele - specific , but related to the regulatory 230 function of FCA at FLC . Overall , this demonstrates that FCA quantitatively modulates transcription 231 to influence the timing of the Polycomb switch . 232 233 We first tried to see if the model could capture the quantitative variation in FLC expression ( analogue 234 mode ) in the absence of the Polycomb module ( see model schematic in Fig . 1D ) . To represent the 235 difference in FCA function between the three genotypes , we used a single parameter controlling the 236 probability of FCA mediated proximal termination of transcription . We then simulated the model with 237 different values for this parameter representing different levels of functionality of the FCA protein . 238 We set the parameter to its highest value for L er , an intermediate value for fca - 3 , and lowest for fca - 1 239 ( Fig . 3B ) . With these parameter settings we found that the model , with just transcription - coupled 240 repression ( Fig . 1D ) was able to recapitulate the analogue mode of regulation , with the simulations 241 showing the lowest frequency of productive transcription events for L er , highest for fca - 1 , and 242 intermediate for fca - 3 ( Fig . 3C ) . Consistent with the relationship between productive transcription and 243 H3K4me1 in the model , the levels of this modification were also predicted to be lowest in L er , 244 intermediate in fca - 3 and highest in fca - 1 ( Fig . 3D ) . Then , keeping all other parameters fixed , we 245 adjusted the values of the FCA effectiveness parameter so that the ratios of productive transcription 246 frequencies at steady - state matched the ratios of mean transcript levels observed by smFISH for the 247 three genotypes ( Antoniou - Kourounioti et al . , 2023 ) . 248 249 With the analogue module further constrained in this way , we simulated the full model , including the 250 Polycomb digital switching module ( Fig . 3A ) . Importantly , this model recapitulated the 251 experimentally observed ( Antoniou - Kourounioti et al . , 2023 ) reduction in FLC transcriptional output 252 ( Fig . 3E ) , as well as the digital switch to stable silencing ( one - way switch ) over time ( Fig . 3F ) 253 observed using FLC - Venus imaging in root meristematic cells ( Antoniou - Kourounioti et al . , 2023 ) . 254 For L er , where productive transcription is lowest , the model predicted a rapid switch to the digital 255 8 OFF / Polycomb silenced state ( Fig . 3E ) . For fca - 3 , the model predicted a much slower switch , with 256 very infrequent switching for fca - 1 ( Fig . 3F , S4A , B ) . In all cases , the switching was predicted be one - 257 way , with the Polycomb silenced state being highly stable . 258 259 Thus , the combined model of transcription - coupled repression and Polycomb silencing predicts that 260 the level of productive transcriptional activity set by the FCA / co - transcriptional silencing / FLD 261 ( analogue ) module determines the level of transcriptional antagonism to H3K27me3 . The level of 262 antagonism in turn dictates the rate of switching to the Polycomb silenced state . 263 Chromatin states in different genotypes can be predicted 264 265 We next used the combined model to predict population levels of H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 at FLC 266 in the three genotypes , predicting low H3K4me1 and high H3K27me3 levels in L er , intermediate 267 levels of both modifications in fca - 3 , and high H3K4me1 and low H3K27me3 in fca - 1 . Starting from 268 an active chromatin state with full H3K4me1 coverage , the model also predicted a progressive 269 reduction in H3K4me1 over time in both L er and fca - 3 , while it reaches a relatively high steady - state 270 level in fca - 1 . In L er and fca - 3 , this reduction is combined with an accumulation of H3K27me3 as 271 more loci switch to the Polycomb silenced state ( Fig . 4A , B ) . 272 273 To validate these predictions , we performed a time course measurement of H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 274 over the locus by chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative PCR ( ChIP - qPCR ) , 275 examining their levels in seedlings at 7 , 14 and 21 days after sowing . Consistent with model 276 predictions , at all timepoints we see that fca - 3 has intermediate levels of H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 , 277 while L er always has the lowest H3K4me1 levels and highest H3K27me3 levels , and fca - 1 the 278 highest H3K4me1 and lowest H3K27me3 levels . The changes in histone modifications over time are 279 also overall qualitatively consistent with the model , with H3K27me3 levels rising and H3K4me1 280 levels falling over time ( Model predictions : Fig . 4A - C ; Experimental measurements : Fig . 4D - H ) , as 281 more loci switch in the digital OFF state . In L er , H3K4me1 shows essentially no change over the 282 experimental timepoints , while the H3K27me3 level clearly increases in this genotype . The model 283 predicts faster dynamics of the transcription coupled repression ( relative to slow Polycomb silencing 284 establishment ) : this is seen in the predicted histone modification dynamics in L er and fca - 3 , where 285 during the initial phase ( 0 to 7 days ) the H3K4me1 levels clearly reduce faster than the rate of 286 H3K27me3 accumulation . The lack of change in experimentally measured H3K4me1 is therefore 287 consistent with the model prediction : by the 7 - day timepoint , H3K4me1 may already be maintained at 288 a low level by the FCA / FLD mediated repression or nucleation of Polycomb , so that subsequent 289 H3K27me3 accumulation has little effect on these levels . We note that this lack of reduction is 290 consistent with the observed increase in H3K27me3 mainly resulting from spreading of this mark 291 9 across the locus : H3K4me1 exhibits similar behaviour during post cold growth , showing very little 292 change during a phase where H3K27me3 spreads across the locus ( Nielsen et al . , 2023 ) . The 293 activating H3K36me3 also shows a similar pattern , with fca - 3 exhibiting intermediate levels , and the 294 overall levels decreasing over time ( Fig . S4C , D ) . The predicted differences in the ratio of proximal to 295 distal polyadenylation of sense transcripts between the FCA mutants and the parental genotype also 296 qualitatively matched the measured ratios for FLC sense transcription in our Quant - seq dataset ( Fig . 297 4C , F ) . 298 299 Overall , the combined model of transcription - coupled repression , mediated by proximal termination 300 of transcription , and Polycomb silencing , successfully predicts both the relative levels of the 301 modifications between genotypes and how these change over time . 302 303 Analogue differences are persistent but the switch to the OFF state is compromised by 304 disrupting a Polycomb methyltransferase 305 306 The model predicts that analogue repression removes the antagonism of transcription on Polycomb 307 and thus permits the switch to Polycomb digital silencing . We tested this model prediction further 308 using a Polycomb mutant – a loss of function mutant of CLF , one of the three Arabidopsis H3K27 309 methyltransferases . This methyltransferase is known to be required for spreading of H3K27me3 from 310 Polycomb nucleation peaks at many Arabidopsis targets ( Shu et al . , 2019 ) , and specifically at FLC , 311 both in developmental ( Shu et al . , 2019 ) and cold induced silencing contexts ( Yang et al . , 2017 ) . We 312 would not expect this mutant to completely disrupt the ON / OFF silencing mode , as H3K27me3 313 nucleation alone , which still occurs in clf , gives a metastable Polycomb silenced state ( Yang et al . , 314 2017 ) . However , we would expect the switch to the OFF state to be partially compromised ( Fig . 5A ) . 315 Only after the H3K27me3 spreads across the whole locus is the Polycomb state fully stable in rapidly 316 dividing cells ( Yang et al . , 2017 ) . In the clf case , the model predicts that the analogue differences 317 persist due to leakage out of the metastable Polycomb OFF state . As a result , the continued slow 318 reduction in overall FLC expression – which is a consequence of a fully stable Polycomb digital 319 switch – is predicted to be missing ( Fig . 5B ) . 320 321 To validate this prediction , we measured FLC expression at the whole plant level , over a time course 322 in five different genotypes : the parental L er , clf - 2 ( Goodrich et al . , 1997 ) , fca - 3 , the fca - 3 clf - 2 double 323 mutant , and fca - 1 . Consistent with model predictions in the clf mutants , we observe that the analogue 324 differences are maintained , but the slow reduction in expression is compromised ( Fig . 5C ) . In addition 325 to FLC expression at the whole plant level , we also conducted time course imaging of Venus tagged 326 FLC in the roots in the clf mutants ( Fig . 5D ) , following the same approach used to analyse the fca 327 alleles in ( Antoniou - Kourounioti et al . , 2023 ) . Again , as predicted , clf - 2 showed clear differences to 328 10 the L er genotype , with ON cells being visible at all three timepoints . This is consistent with FLC 329 switching both ON to OFF and OFF to ON as described above , and the observed lack of reduction in 330 FLC expression at the whole plant level ( Fig . 5C ) . We note that both clf - 2 and fca - 3 clf - 2 exhibited 331 large variability between roots , with some roots showing essentially no FLC ON cells ( Fig . S5 ) . This 332 is possibly due to the widespread misregulation of growth and developmental genes resulting from the 333 compromised Polycomb silencing in this mutant . Nevertheless , consistent with the model predictions , 334 we see that the slow Polycomb digital switch to OFF is disrupted in fca - 3 clf - 2 : when comparing roots 335 exhibiting ON cells in the double mutant to fca - 3 roots , the double mutant overall shows more ON 336 cells at later timepoints . 337 338 The model also predicts a similar , high ratio of proximal to distal termination in the clf mutant and the 339 L er genotype ( Fig . 4C ) , even though overall transcription is lower in L er . This is because the 340 FCA / FLD mediated transcription coupled mechanism is not disrupted in any way in the clf mutant 341 model , so that the promotion of proximal termination by this mechanism , and the resulting feedback , 342 remains intact . We measured the ratio of proximal to distal termination of the FLC sense transcript in 343 the clf mutant , using our strand - specific Quant - seq data . Consistent with the model prediction , it 344 exhibits a similar ratio to the L er genotype ( Fig . 4F ) . 345 346 As further validation of the model , we then compared the predicted H3K27me3 levels at the locus in a 347 clf mutant to experimentally measured levels . The lack of stability of the nucleated state in the model 348 means that it predicts an H3K27me3 peak , but at significantly lower levels relative to a spread state . 349 The incorporation of the FLC gene loop in the model , as outlined above , causes the model to generate 350 a second peak in the FLC 3’ region , in the region that interacts strongly with the nucleation region . 351 Consistent with these predictions , we find that the ChIP profile of H3K27me3 in clf - 2 exhibits two 352 peaks , at significantly lower levels relative to the spread state in L er ( Fig . 5E ) . Our results also 353 aligned well with previously published genome - wide H3K27me3 data for a clf mutant in a Col - 0 354 background ( Shu et al . , 2019 ) . Overall , predictions from the model for clf mutants match well with 355 our experimental data . 356 Co - transcriptional occupancy of FLD at FLC 357 358 We next investigated the mechanism of FLD functionality in the co - transcriptional repression 359 mechanism . In apparent contradiction to its role as a repressor , FLD occupancy was found to be 360 significantly higher in a high transcriptional state of FLC , relative to a Polycomb silenced low 361 transcriptional state . Specifically , high FLD levels were assayed by ChIP - seq of a transgenic fld - 4 ; 362 3xFLAG - FLD in the Col FRI background , where the FLC activator FRIGIDA sets up a high 363 11 transcriptional state ( Inagaki et al . , 2021 ) . In contrast , in a Col - 0 background , where FRI is not 364 functional , FLC is Polycomb silenced and FLD shows low enrichment . 365 366 The model allows us to explain this counter - intuitive behaviour of FLD . Since FLD function is 367 coupled to transcription and termination in the model , it predicts that FLD targeting must be co - 368 transcriptional , consistent with the molecular and genetic analysis in the accompanying paper ( Mateo - 369 Bonmatí et al . , 2023 ) . FLD levels at the locus must therefore be low in a Polycomb silenced state , 370 where transcription events are infrequent . This prediction is consistent with the genome - wide 371 correlation between FLD enrichment and transcription as measured by Pol II ChIP and transcript 372 amounts in ( Inagaki et al . , 2021 ) . Furthermore , by capturing the digital switch off in L er and fca - 3 , 373 the model predicts that FLD enrichment would reduce over time in these genotypes . In essence , FLD 374 is only needed transiently to generate a lowly - transcribed state capable of nucleating Polycomb 375 silencing , as transcription antagonises Polycomb . Following Polycomb nucleation and spreading of 376 H3K27me3 , FLD recruitment to the locus is reduced due to the lack of transcription . 377 378 The experimental validation of the first prediction of the model ( FLD coupled to transcription ) is 379 presented in the accompanying paper ( Mateo - Bonmatí et al . , 2023 ) . ChIP - qPCR analysis of FLD 380 enrichment at FLC in high transcription states induced by two very different genetic backgrounds 381 ( fca - 9 and FRI ) compared with a Polycomb silenced state ( Col - 0 ) perfectly fit a co - transcriptional role 382 for FLD . The model also supports the scenario proposed by Inagaki et al . , ( 2021 ) in which FLD 383 downregulates histone H3K4me1 in regions with convergent overlapping transcription genome - wide 384 in Arabidopsis . Despite functioning in the same genetic pathway , FLD function , or at least 385 localization , seems to be FCA - independent , suggesting that both activities are functionally 386 coupled / sequential but physically disconnected . 387 388 We also tested the second model prediction that FLD enrichment would change over time as a result 389 of the digital switch to the Polycomb silenced state . We measured 3xFLAG - FLD enrichment by 390 ChIP - qPCR over a time course in a Col - 0 background ( as high - expressing fca - 9 and FRI are not 391 expected to exhibit a digital switch OFF ) . Consistent with model predictions , we observed a reduction 392 over time in FLD enrichment across FLC ( Fig . 6B ) , mirroring the reduction in FLC transcription 393 levels over time also observed in Col - 0 by qPCR ( Fig . 6A ) . Levels at the initial 7 - day timepoint were 394 high and declined to very low levels ( almost background ) by 21 days . 395 396 Together , these observations are consistent with model predictions of co - transcriptional FLD targeting 397 to the FLC locus , with its repressive activity dependent on FCA - mediated proximal polyadenylation 398 of sense and antisense transcription . In genotypes such as fca - 9 , where FCA is non - functional , or in 399 12 the presence of the transcriptional activator FRIGIDA , which antagonises proximal PA by FCA , FLD 400 continues to be co - transcriptionally targeted , but fails to carry out its repressive function . 401 Discussion 402 403 In this work , we have elucidated how a transcription - coupled repression mechanism enables analogue 404 regulation of transcriptional output , where the chromatin state is set up by alternative termination . The 405 mechanistic details of how the 3’ processing decisions are linked to histone demethylation and thus 406 low transcription are outlined in the accompanying paper . We build on this using a computational 407 model to reveal the overall mechanism , where the level of productive transcriptional activity set by 408 such an analogue mechanism determines the level of transcriptional antagonism to Polycomb 409 silencing . Consequently , while the targeting of Polycomb to FLC is a mechanistically parallel process 410 to the co - transcriptional processing / demethylation and not a linear downstream outcome , the different 411 levels of transcriptional activity set by the transcription coupled repression can dictate the rate of 412 establishment of Polycomb silencing ( Fig . 7 ) . We validated the model by a variety of means , 413 including gene expression , histone modification and FLC - Venus imaging time courses in the wild - 414 type and in cases disrupted via a Polycomb mutation . Our model also resolves the apparent 415 contradiction between the observed FLD targeting to a transcriptionally active FLC locus , and its role 416 as a repressor . 417 418 Transcriptional antagonism to Polycomb silencing is fundamental to our understanding of the 419 silencing mechanism . Importantly , similar concepts have been used to understand Polycomb silencing 420 in the mammalian context ( Klose et al . , 2013 ) , and this antagonism has also been validated in a 421 mammalian system ( Holoch et al . , 2021 ) . Polycomb targets that can be stably switched from 422 repressed to activated upon transient Polycomb perturbation , tend to have higher intrinsic 423 transcription . Transcriptional antagonism of a chromatin mediated silencing mechanism involving 424 Polycomb response elements has also been demonstrated recently in Drosophila ( Voortman et al . , 425 2022 ) . Here , in a plant context , this antagonism sets the timescale for the slow switch into the digital 426 Polycomb silenced state , in an interlinked three - way association between chromatin , transcription and 427 co - transcriptional processing ( Graphical Abstract ) . Judging from the H3K27me3 profiles in the wild 428 type and clf - 2 mutant , this switch in warm conditions appears to utilise a Polycomb nucleation and 429 spreading mechanism , as it does in cold conditions . It is currently unknown precisely how this warm 430 Polycomb nucleation is controlled without apparently using elements like VEL proteins that induce 431 nucleation by Polycomb in cold conditions ( Yang et al . , 2017 ) . 432 433 Importantly , our model predicts chromatin state and transcriptional bistability in the case of the fca - 1 434 ( null ) mutant ( Fig . S4B ) , whereas for fca - 3 and L er , only the silenced is fully stable . As a result , if 435 13 silencing can be established in fca - 1 ( independently of FCA ) , for example mediated by cold - specific 436 PRC2 accessories in the case of cold - induced silencing , we predict that both silenced and active states 437 can each be stably maintained . Hence , our conceptual framework also explains why cold - induced 438 Polycomb silencing can be maintained in fca ( or fld ) mutants . The model predicts that these proteins 439 are needed only for Polycomb silencing establishment during development , but not for its 440 maintenance . In future work , it would be very interesting to specifically test this prediction by 441 removing FCA and / or FLD at a later developmental stage after silencing is established . 442 443 The cause of the proximal polyadenylation on both FLC strands remains to be defined but is likely to 444 involve stalling of the RNA Pol II complex . RNA Pol II stalling is now recognised as a major 445 transcriptional control point , frequently associated with premature termination ( Fong et al . , 2022 ; Noe 446 Gonzalez et al . , 2021 ; Wagner et al . , 2023 ) . Antisense transcription at FLC induces the formation of 447 an R - loop in the 3’ region , ( Xu et al . , 2021 ) , likely the consequence of negative supercoiling induced 448 by an RNA Pol II stall . Techniques such as NET - seq should help to unravel the basis of its formation . 449 FCA has been proposed to recognize the R - loop , which is stabilized by the homeodomain protein 450 NDX , as a chromatin ‘tangle’ ( Sun et al . , 2013 ; Xu et al . , 2021 ) , and promote proximal 451 polyadenylation through recruitment of the 3’ processing factors . Anti - termination factors that prevent 452 the use of early termination sites have been implicated in tuning transcriptional output from 453 eukaryotic polymerases ( Gregersen et al . , 2019 ) . In the case of FLC , the transcriptional activator 454 FRIGIDA has recently been shown to function at least partly by antagonising FCA mediated proximal 455 cleavage and polyadenylation of FLC sense transcription at specific stages of embryo development 456 ( Schon et al . , 2021 ) . The presence of active FRIGIDA promotes distal polyadenylation and prevents 457 FLC silencing , further supporting the view that FCA mediated proximal termination is essential for 458 repression . Interestingly , FRIGIDA expression outside of a specific developmental stage fails to 459 activate FLC expression ( Schon et al . , 2021 ) : this reinforces the view that once Polycomb epigenetic 460 silencing has been established , reactivating transcription is difficult , with simple upregulation of an 461 activator being insufficient to overcome robust digital silencing . 462 463 Overall , we have revealed the mechanism of co - transcriptional silencing at FLC , an essential 464 precursor for slow switching into the Polycomb silenced state . These features are included in an 465 animation to help explain these molecular feedbacks , and how this mechanism can lead to expression 466 of FLC in one of two stable expression states ( Movie 1 ) . We anticipate these mechanisms will have 467 broad relevance , with additional examples emerging over time ( Chen et al . , 2023 ) . It is particularly 468 intriguing that many elements of this pathway , such as FLD and FCA , are conserved 469 transcriptional / splicing regulators , that likely have functions at many targets . Their core role in an 470 integrated sense / anti - sense transcriptional circuitry likely singles out FLC as being acutely sensitive to 471 their action . 472 14 473 Methods 474 475 Plant materials 476 All the plants were homozygous for the indicated genotype . Seeds were surface sterilized in 40 % v / v 477 commercial bleach for 10 min and rinsed 4 times with sterile distilled water . Seeds were then sown on 478 standard half - strength Murashige and Skoog ( MS ) medium ( 0 . 22 % MS , 8 % plant agar ) media plates 479 and kept at 4°C in darkness for 3 days before being transferred to long day photoperiod conditions ( 16 480 h of light , 8 h dark ) . 481 482 Plant growth ( Imaging ) 483 Seeds were surface - sterilized with 5 % ( v / v ) sodium hypochlorite for 5 min , rinsed with sterile water 484 4x for 1 min and stratified at 4°C for 2 days in water and in the dark . Seeds were plated on MES 485 buffered Murashige and Skoog ( GM - MS ) media , pH 5 . 8 , containing respective antibiotics and grown 486 on vertically oriented petri plates for 7 days in long - day conditions ( 16 h light / 8 h dark , 22 / 20°C ) . 487 488 Imaging 489 Time course imaging of FLC - Venus protein levels in the epidermis of L er , fca allelic mutants , the clf - 490 2 mutant as well as the fca - 3 clf - 2 mutant , was performed using a Leica confocal Stellaris 8 491 microscope with a 20x multi - immersion objective ( 0 . 75 NA ) . Root tips ( 2 cm ) were cut off and 492 immersed in 1 . 5 µg / mL Propidium Iodide ( PI , Sigma – Aldrich , P4864 ) in 1x PBS before being imaged 493 immediately . The OPSL 514 laser was used at 5 % power with 514 nm excitation for FLC - Venus and 494 PI . In photon counting mode , Venus was detected between 518 - 550 nm with the HyD SMD2 detector , 495 PI was detected between ~ 600 - 650 nm . Images were acquired with a laser speed of 400 Hz , line 496 accumulation of 6 ( pixel dwell time of 2 . 43 µs ) , a Z - step size of 0 . 95 µm and a pinhole size of 1 AU . 497 The same settings were used at all imaging time points to allow direct comparison between genotypes 498 and time points . The representative images were projected using a single middle slice from the PI 499 channel to show the cell outline , and 10 slices of FLC - Venus channel were maximum intensity 500 projected . In standard image presentation , the dynamic range of the FLC - Venus channel was pushed 501 from 0 - 255 to 2 - 11 , in enhanced image presentation , the dynamic ranged was pushed from 2 - 7 . In 502 Supp Fig S5 , the dynamic range of FLC - Venus channel was enhanced from 0 - 255 to 2 - 20 for all 503 images . 504 505 RNA extraction and RT - qPCR 506 Total RNA was extracted as previously described ( Box et al . 2011 ) . Genomic DNA was digested with 507 TURBO DNA - free ( Ambion Turbo Dnase kit AM1907 ) according to manufacturer´s guidelines , 508 15 before reverse transcription ( RT ) was performed . The RT reactions were performed with SuperScript 509 IV reverse transcriptase ( ThermoFisher , 18090010 ) following the manufacturer´s instructions using 510 gene - specific primers . Primers are listed in Supplemental Table S1 . For RNA sequencing 511 experiments , RNA was further purified with the Qiagen Rneasy miniprep kit ( 74106 ) . 512 513 RNA sequencing 514 Library preparation and sequencing was performed by Lexogen GmbH .

A sequencing - ready pool of indexed libraries were 520 sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 with a 100 - cycle cartridge using the Custom Sequencing 521 Primer ( CSP ) at Lexogen GmbH . 522 523 Bioinformatics analysis 524 Data analysis of RNAseq data was performed by Lexogen GmbH using their standard 525 pipeline . Read Quality was assessed by FastQC and trimmed for quality and adapter content 526 with cutadapt version 1 . 18 ( Martin , 2011 ) . Clean reads were mapped to the Arabidopsis 527 reference genome ( TAIR10 ) with STAR version 2 . 6 . 1a ( Dobin et al . , 2013 ) . Raw reads have 528 been deposited on Short Read Archive ( SRA ) under the reference PRJNA980626 , and can be 529 accessed at : PRJNA980626 . To calculate proximal to distal count ratios , read ends were 530 counted for each identified polyA cluster ( ( Schon et al . , 2021 ) , 531 FLC _ polyA _ cluster _ coords . txt ) . Proximal polyadenylation clusters are defined as 532 termination sites within the first Exon and Intron of FLC while distal clusters are in close 533 proximity to the canonical polyadenylation site . For each biological sample , ratios were 534 calculated from the summed proximal and distal cluster counts 535 ( FLC _ termination _ clusters . txt ) . 536 537 ChIP timecourse for histone modifications 538 2 . 5 g of 7 - , 14 - , or 21 - day - old seedlings were crosslinked in 1 % formaldehyde and grinded to fine 539 powder .

Nuclei were extracted using Honda 559 buffer as described for histone ChIP . Nuclei pellets were resuspended in 600 µl of RIPA buffer ( 1 % 560 NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % Sodium Deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS in PBS ) and sonicated 5 times for 5 min ( 30s ON / 561 30s OFF ) at high mode in a Bioruptor Pico ( Diagenode ) . IP were performed overnight at 4°C using 562 1 . 5 mg of pre - coated epoxy Epoxy Dynabeads ( M - 270 ) with 1 . 5 μ l of anti - FLAG ( Sigma , F1804 ) per 563 reaction .

( B ) Schematic of combined digital and analogue regulation observed 578 experimentally in fca mutants . ( C ) Schematic showing the transcription coupled repression 579 mechanism at FLC . Activating H3K4me1 can be added during productive transcription ( green dashed 580 17 arrow ) . The repression mechanism consists of proximal polyadenylation and termination of sense and 581 antisense transcription mediated by the RNA binding protein FCA , which then enables removal of 582 transcriptionally activating H3K4me1 across the locus by the putative histone demethylase FLD . The 583 removal of H3K4me1 can inhibit co - transcriptional processing by preventing the addition of 584 H3K36me3 , and consequently promotes further proximal termination . Thus , a feedback loop 585 ( highlighted by the black dashed arrows ) is formed , where the occurrence of proximal termination 586 promotes further proximal termination . ( D ) Schematic of the mathematical model , for the 587 transcription coupled repression mechanism depicted in ( C ) . The schematic highlights the key 588 processes and interactions captured by the mathematical model : sense and antisense transcription , co - 589 transcriptional addition of H3K4me1 ( green dashed arrows ) , FCA mediated proximal termination of 590 transcription , FLD mediated removal of H3K4me1 , and the promotion of proximal termination by 591 low H3K4me1 coverage .

The model 630 qualitatively captures the relative changes in the proximal to distal ratio between mutants .

The model also describes transcription events at 22 the locus – sense and antisense – as well as alternative polyadenylation during these transcription 23 events . 24 25 Model features : 26 Activating and repressive histone modifications 27 The mathematical model describes the modification state of each H3 histone at the FLC 28 locus , with the whole locus represented by an array of 30 nucleosomes , consistent with the 29 approximately 6 kilobases extent of the locus ( nucleosomal DNA + linker DNA spans 30 approximately 200 bp ) . The modifications described are : ( 1 ) H3K4me1 , an activating 31 modification associated with gene bodies in Arabidopsis , and known to exhibit significant 32 differences between active and silenced states of FLC ; ( 2 ) the Polycomb - mediated repressive 33 modification H3K27me3 as well as possible H3K27me2 , H3K27me1 and me0 states . The 34 model assumes mutual exclusivity of K4me and K27me on the same H3 tail in line with 35 experimentally observed mutual exclusivity in mESCs ( Shema et al . , 2016 ; Voigt et al . , 2012 ) 36 ( Kim et al . , 2013 ; Schmitges et al . , 2011 ) . Evidence from mammalian and yeast studies 37 indicate that H3K27me is added non - processively ( McCabe et al . , 2012 ; Soares et al . , 2017 ) . 38 Therefore , the model assumes stepwise addition of these modifications . 39 40 Sense and Antisense transcription 41 25 The model describes sense and antisense transcription events at the locus . The frequency of 42 these events ( assumed to represent transcription initiation or transition to elongation ) is 43 determined by the coverage of repressive H3K27me3 across the locus . This is consistent with 44 Polycomb ( PRC1 ) binding to H3K27me3 and controlling accessibility to gene regulatory 45 elements by mediating compaction ( Blackledge and Klose , 2021 ) , as well as other potential 46 H3K27me3 - mediated mechanisms , such as inhibition of RNA Pol II release from the 47 Transcription Start Site ( TSS ) ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ) , thus preventing transitions into an actively 48 transcribing Pol II state ( Brookes et al . , 2012 ) . Our data indicates that both sense and 49 antisense transcription at FLC are silenced by Polycomb – both types of transcripts are 50 present at higher levels in the absence of Polycomb silencing , as observed in genotypes 51 containing the FLC activator FRIGIDA , and in loss of function mutants of FCA and FLD . 52 53 Co - transcriptional addition of activating modifications 54 Activating modification such as H3K4me and H3K36me in many contexts and across 55 organisms are known to be added co - transcriptionally ( Chan et al . , 2022 ) . The association of 56 the H3K4 methyltransferase complex with elongating RNA Pol II and the addition of this 57 modification during transcriptional elongation has been demonstrated in S . cerevisiae ( Soares 58 et al . , 2017 ) . In the case of Arabidopsis H3K4me1 , a genome wide analysis of the localization 59 patterns of H3K4me1 , of RNA Pol II , and of the different H3K4 methyltransferases , indicates 60 that the co - transcriptional addition of H3K4me1 over the gene body is mediated mainly by 61 the methyltransferase ATXR7 ( Oya et al . , 2022 ) . Consistent with this role , an ATXR7 mutant 62 has been shown to partially suppress FLC activation by the activator FRIGIDA ( Tamada et 63 al . , 2009 ) . 64 65 Alternative polyadenylation mediated by coverage of activating modifications 66 The model assumes that higher overall coverage of H3K4me1 across the locus promotes 67 distal termination of transcription . This assumption is in line with a potential feedback 68 mechanism where H3K4me1 enables binding of the H3K36me3 methyltransferase ( SDG8 ) 69 and consequent H3K36me3 - mediated assembly of splicing factors ( Leung et al . , 2019 ) which 70 facilitate co - transcriptional processing . Such a role for H3K4 methylation is also consistent 71 with evidence in yeast ( Soares et al . , 2017 ) and mammalian cells ( Wang et al . , 2023 ) , 72 indicating a role in facilitating productive transcriptional elongation . 73 74 Proximal termination mediated removal of activating modifications 75 The model assumes proximal termination of both sense and antisense mediates removal of 76 H3K4me1 . This is in line with the potential function of FLD as a demethylase ( Inagaki et al . , 77 2021 ) , and the fact that genetically , FLD relies on FCA - mediated proximal termination of 78 26 antisense ( Liu et al . , 2007 ) . The removal of H3K4me1 resulting from proximal PA is assumed 79 to take place uniformly across the whole locus , as the data we currently have does not allow 80 us to observe the spatial details of this process . 81 82 Polycomb nucleation and spreading 83 The model describes nucleation of H3K27me by Polycomb in the FLC nucleation region , 84 where Polycomb silencing is known to be nucleated during cold - induced chromatin silencing 85 of FLC . Subsequent H3K27me3 spreading across the locus in this context is known to depend 86 on the plant PRC2 methyltransferase CLF and on an active cell cycle , while nucleation does 87 not depend on either . Experimental evidence from a genome - wide ChIP - seq study showing 88 H3K27me3 patterns in a clf mutant ( Shu et al . , 2019 ) indicates that a similar mechanism is 89 involved in the early developmental silencing of FLC – the clf mutant shows a clear 90 H3K27me3 peak in the FLC nucleation region , while spreading is compromised . Consistent 91 with this , in the wild - type , H3K27me3 is assumed to spread to the rest of the locus through 92 interactions with the nucleation region , through read - write feedback interactions . The 93 spreading is assumed to rely on an active cell cycle – in the model , this is achieved by having 94 the interactions with the nucleation region stronger in S / G2 phases . 95 96 Looping interactions mediating Polycomb activity 97 Experimental evidence indicates the existence of a gene loop mediating an interaction 98 between the 5’ and 3’ ends of FLC ( Crevillen et al . , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2018 ) , with the level of 99 interaction potentially depending the transcriptional state of the locus ( Li et al . , 2018 ) . 100 Significantly , this looping interaction is present in the silenced FLC state in the reference 101 genotype Col - 0 , and consistently , a secondary peak of H3K27me3 is observed in published 102 ChIP - seq data in clf ( Shu et al . , 2019 ) . Therefore , we capture this interaction in the model by 103 allowing for stronger interactions with the nucleation region for a designated “looping region” 104 within the gene body . 105 106 Productive transcription antagonises H3K27me 107 Experimental evidence from mammalian systems indicates that productive transcription can 108 promote removal of H3K27me through histone exchange . In addition , the H3K27me 109 demethylases have been shown to physically interact with and co - localise on chromatin with 110 elongating RNA Pol II , in Drosophila ( Smith et al . , 2008 ) and more specifically at the FLC 111 locus ( Yang et al . , 2016 ) . Both features have been captured in previous models of Polycomb 112 silencing ( Berry et al . , 2017 ) , and they are also incorporated in the current model . These 113 features allow the rate of H3K27me turnover across the locus to be determined by the 114 frequency of transcription events . Our model also incorporates alternative PA of both sense 115 27 and antisense transcription , allowing proximal PA and termination of RNA Pol II . The model 116 assumes that only distal PA and termination ( i . e . , productive transcription events ) can remove 117 H3K27me through the above mechanisms . 118 119 120 121 Mutual exclusivity of sense and antisense at the same locus 122 We previously found that distal antisense transcription and sense FLC transcription are 123 mutually exclusive at individual FLC loci ( Rosa et al . , 2016 ) . Consistent with this mutual 124 exclusivity , we have observed an anticorrelation between the levels of distal antisense 125 transcripts and sense transcripts in multiple contexts , including different chromatin states of 126 the FLC locus ( Ietswaart et al . , 2017 ; Zhao et al . , 2021 ) . While this evidence demonstrates a 127 mutual exclusivity between full length ( distal ) sense and antisense transcription events , we 128 currently do not have data to determine whether the mutual exclusivity applies to proximally 129 terminated transcription events . However , for simplicity , the model assumes mutual 130 exclusivity for both types of transcription events . This is realised by having a refractory 131 period after a sense ( antisense ) transcription event , during which antisense ( sense ) initiation is 132 not allowed to occur . The model assumes equal refractory periods for sense and antisense 133 transcription , as well as for distal and proximal termination . 134 135 Inheritance of modified histones during DNA replication 136 In line with recent evidence indicating that only H3 - H4 tetramers carrying repressive 137 modifications are reliably inherited across DNA replication ( Escobar et al . , 2021 ) , the model 138 assumes that H3 pairs corresponding to an individual nucleosome are inherited with 139 probability half to a daughter strand , only if at least one of the H3 carries K27 methylation . 140 141 Additional considerations for the model 142 Absence of a role for the L er Mutator - like transposable element at FLC 143 The FLC allele in the L er accession is known to contain a Mutator - like transposable element ( TE ) in 144 intron 1 that causes lower expression from this allele relative to FLC alleles in other accessions 145 ( Michaels et al . , 2003 ) . This lower expression results from RNAi - mediated chromatin silencing of the 146 TE element ( Liu et al . , 2004 ) . However , experimental evidence indicates that the intermediate FLC 147 expression levels in fca mutants are unlikely to be mediated by the TE . The TE has been shown to act 148 in cis ( Michaels et al . , 2003 ) , as expression of an FLC allele from the Columbia - 0 ( Col - 0 ) accession is 149 unaffected in F1 plants generated by a L er to Col - 0 cross , while the L er FLC allele expression is 150 attenuated by the TE . In our case , the intermediate expression in fca mutants could be observed for 151 both the endogenous FLC ( L er FLC containing TE ) and the transgenic Venus tagged FLC ( Col - 0 152 28 FLC sequence ) , arguing against a role for the cis - acting TE mechanism in generating intermediate 153 transcription states . 154 155 156 157 Role for H3K36me3 158 The above model only considers the histone modifications H3K4me1 and H3K27me , and does not 159 explicitly consider H3K36me3 . The Arabidopsis H3K36 methyltransferase SDG8 is known to 160 recognise H3K4me1 , so H3K4me1 removal might be expected to affect H3K36 methylation . 161 Interestingly , FLC upregulation in an fca mutant is rescued in an sdg8 fca double mutant ( Fang et al . , 162 2020 ) , indicating that H3K36me3 may be essential to set up an active transcriptional state at FLC . 163 This is consistent with our previous ChIP - qPCR data at FLC , showing high levels of H3K4me1 and 164 H3K36me3 at the locus in a high transcriptional state and low levels of both these modifications in a 165 low transcriptional state ( Fang et al . , 2020 ) . Recent evidence from Saccharomyces cerevisiae , shows 166 that H3K36me3 is required for the effective co - transcriptional splicing and recruitment of splicing 167 factors ( Leung et al . , 2019 ) . Based on this evidence , FLD - mediated removal of H3K4me1 may cause 168 reduced H3K36 methylation , which in turn promotes further early transcription termination . For 169 simplicity , the model omits the H3K36me3 step and assumes that H3K4me1 implicitly mediates this 170 effect on termination . 171 172 Direct physical interaction between transcription coupled repression and Polycomb 173 FCA has been reported to interact directly with the Arabidopsis PRC2 methyltransferase CLF in vivo 174 ( Tian et al . , 2019 ) . However , we have found no evidence of this interaction in our FCA 175 immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry ( IP - MS ) data or other published CLF IP - MS 176 data ( Fang et al . , 2019 ; Liang et al . , 2015 ) , and hence this interaction is not further considered in our 177 model or other analyses . 178 179 Model implementation 180 Locus description : The whole locus represented by an array of 30 nucleosomes ( 60 H3 histones ) , 181 consistent with the approximately 6 kilobase extent of the locus ( nucleosomal DNA + linker DNA 182 spans approximately 200 bp ) . 183 184 Mutually exclusive H3 modifications : Each H3 histone can be in one of five modification mutually 185 exclusive states : { - 1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 } representing H3K4me1 , H3 unmodified on K4 and K27 , H3K27me1 , 186 me2 , and me3 respectively . This means addition of K27me can take place only in the absence of 187 H3K4me1 and vice versa . All transitions are assumed to be non - processive : only transitions involving 188 addition / removal of a single methyl group are allowed . The modification state of the locus is 189 29 representing by an array S representing the modification states of the 60 histones . Each entry (cid:0) (cid:0) can 190 take the values { - 1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 } . The array S is used to store the current state of all 60 histones over the 191 course of the simulation . Note that we do not describe H3K36me3 in the model , as the evidence 192 indicates it is downstream of H3K4me1 , as described above and in the main text . 193 194 Alternative termination of transcription : Each transcription event ( sense or antisense ) has a 195 probability of being proximally terminated . This probability is determined by both the current 196 H3K4me1 fractional coverage ( whole locus ) and the FCA effectiveness parameter , as follows : 197 (cid:0)(cid:2)Proximal(cid:11) (cid:12) (cid:13) (cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:14) (cid:2)(cid:15) (cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:15) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) (cid:11)(cid:2)1 (cid:17) (cid:0) (cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:6)(cid:15)(cid:16) (cid:11)(cid:2)1 (cid:17) (cid:13) (cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:17) (cid:18) (cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:11) . The probability of distal termination is given by : 198 (cid:0) (cid:2) Distal (cid:11) (cid:12) 1 (cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:2)Proximal(cid:11) . 199 Here (cid:3) (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4) represents FCA effectiveness parameter and (cid:3) (cid:5) captures possible FCA independent 200 proximal termination . (cid:2)(cid:15) (cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:15) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) (cid:11) is constrained to be less than or equal to 1 . (cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10) represents 201 the fractional coverage of H3K4me1 , δ Proximal is a residual proximal termination probability ( some 202 proximal termination occurs even when (cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10) (cid:5) 1 ) , and μ Distal is a residual probability for distal 203 termination ( some distal termination occurs even when (cid:3) (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:5) 1 or (cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10) (cid:5) 0 ) . 204 205 Transcriptional antagonism of Polycomb : ( 1 ) Histone exchange : during each distally terminated 206 transcription event , iterating over the histones ( entries of array S ) , for each histone , we generate a 207 pseudo - random number from a uniform distribution ( 0 , 1 ) and set both entries corresponding to the 208 current nucleosome to 0 if the generated number is less than (cid:3) (cid:9)(cid:11) / 2 ( see Supplementary Table ) . ( 2 ) 209 Co - transcriptional Demethylation : During each distally terminated transcription event , iterating over 210 the entries of array (cid:0) , for each histone , we generate a pseudo - random number from a uniform 211 distribution ( 0 , 1 ) and reduce the methylation state by one if the current state is { 1 , 2 , or 3 } AND the 212 generated number is less than (cid:3) (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:8) ( see Supplementary Table ) . 213 214 Transcription mediated effects on H3K4 methylation : ( 1 ) Co - transcriptional addition of 215 H3K4me1 : Each unmodified H3 histone has a fixed probability (cid:3) (cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:18) , of being methylated during a 216 productive ( distally terminated ) transcription event ( not in case of proximal termination ) . ( 2 ) H3K4 217 demethylation by FLD : Each H3 histone carrying H3K4me1 has a fixed probability (cid:3) (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:8)(cid:2)(cid:19)(cid:20) of losing 218 this modification during a proximally terminated transcription event . 219 220 H3K4me1 dynamics : The background turnover rate ( independent of proximal termination and FLD ) 221 of H3K4me1 is set so that overall turnover rates of H3K27me3 and H3K4me1 are in the ratio 222 30 3 . 128 / 0 . 959 , as measured in HeLa cells by a SILAC technique in ( Zee et al . , 2010 ) . The H3K4 223 methylation propensities ( background and transcription mediated ) are chosen to be significantly 224 higher than the K27me3 propensities , consistent with faster H3K4 methylation seen in time course 225 evidence from mammalian systems . 226 227 H3K27me3 dynamics : Values for methylation rate constants are mostly chosen as in . The overall 228 rate alone is adjusted from its value in ( Berry 2017 ) to allow for a changed interaction paradigm – 229 instead of just nearest neighbour interactions , the current model allows long ranged interactions 230 between nucleosomes across the whole locus , with any nucleosome being able to interact with any 231 other within the locus at some rate ( see below ) . To account for nucleation , spreading and the looping 232 interaction , the nucleosome array representing the whole locus is divided into three subsets : 233 nucleation region ( NR , nucleosomes 1 to 3 , i . e . , histones 1 to 6 ) , looping region ( LR , nucleosomes 20 234 to 22 , i . e . , histones 39 to 44 ) , and body region ( Body , remaining nucleosomes ) . The choice of 235 nucleosomes 19 to 21 for the looping region is consistent with the observed secondary nucleation 236 peak observed around 4kb downstream of the FLC TSS in published data for the clf mutant ( Shu et 237 al . , 2019 ) . 238 239 The methylation propensities at each histone (cid:10) are computed as : 240 (cid:11) (cid:0)me (cid:5) β (cid:13)δ (cid:21) (cid:0) , (cid:5) (cid:15)(cid:16) me0 - 1 (cid:17) k (cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:5)(cid:25)(cid:10) E (cid:26) (cid:20) (cid:17) δ (cid:21) (cid:0) , (cid:10) (cid:15)(cid:16) me1 - 2 (cid:17) k (cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:10)(cid:25)(cid:27) E (cid:26) (cid:20) (cid:17) δ (cid:21) (cid:0) , (cid:27) (cid:15)(cid:16) me2 - 3 (cid:17) k (cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:27)(cid:25)(cid:28) E (cid:26) (cid:20)(cid:21) where (cid:22) (cid:0) represents the PRC2 read - write feedback contribution . 241 242 For nucleation region histones , the PRC2 read - write feedback mediated contribution to the H3K27 243 methylation propensity is computed as : 244 (cid:23) (cid:5) (cid:12) (cid:24) (cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:25) (cid:26)(cid:27) me2 (cid:13) (cid:22) (cid:0) , 2 (cid:14) (cid:13) (cid:22) (cid:0) , 3 (cid:28) (cid:14) (cid:24)(cid:25)(cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:24) (cid:26)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:25) (cid:26)(cid:27) me2 (cid:13) (cid:22) (cid:0) , 2 (cid:14) (cid:13) (cid:22) (cid:0) , 3 (cid:28) (cid:14) (cid:24)(cid:25)(cid:26)(cid:21) (cid:24) (cid:27)(cid:3)(cid:28)(cid:29)(cid:20)(cid:21) (cid:25) (cid:26)(cid:27) me2 (cid:13) (cid:22) (cid:0) , 2 (cid:14) (cid:13) (cid:22) (cid:0) , 3 (cid:28) (cid:24)(cid:25)(cid:27)(cid:3)(cid:28)(cid:29) , 245 where ρ me2 is the relative activation of PRC2 by H3K27me2 as compared to H3K27me3 . For the 246 looping region histones , the PRC2 read - write feedback mediated contribution to the H3K27 247 methylation propensity is computed as : 248 (cid:22) (cid:0) (cid:5) (cid:23) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:19)(cid:30) (cid:24) (cid:13) (cid:25) me2 (cid:26) (cid:31) (cid:2) , 2 (cid:17) (cid:26) (cid:31) (cid:2) , 3 (cid:21) (cid:17) ! (cid:29)(cid:30) (cid:23) (cid:19)(cid:30)(cid:19)(cid:30) (cid:24) (cid:13) (cid:25) me2 (cid:26) (cid:31) (cid:2) , 2 (cid:17) (cid:26) (cid:31) (cid:2) , 3 (cid:21) (cid:17) ! (cid:19)(cid:30) (cid:23) " # (cid:12) $ (cid:19)(cid:30) (cid:24) (cid:13) (cid:25) me2 (cid:26) (cid:31) (cid:2) , 2 (cid:17) (cid:26) (cid:31) (cid:2) , 3 (cid:21) . ! " # (cid:12) $ For the remaining gene body histones , the PRC2 read - write feedback mediated contribution to the 249 H3K27 methylation propensity is computed as : 250 31 (cid:22) (cid:0) (cid:5) (cid:23) (cid:29)(cid:30) " # (cid:12) $ (cid:24) (cid:13)(cid:25) me2 (cid:26) (cid:31) (cid:2) , 2 (cid:17) (cid:26) (cid:31) (cid:2) , 3 (cid:21) (cid:17) ! (cid:29)(cid:30) (cid:23) (cid:19)(cid:30) " # (cid:12) $ (cid:24) (cid:13)(cid:25) me2 (cid:26) (cid:31) (cid:2) , 2 (cid:17) (cid:26) (cid:31) (cid:2) , 3 (cid:21) (cid:17) ! (cid:19)(cid:30) (cid:23) " # (cid:12) $ " # (cid:12) $ (cid:24) (cid:13)(cid:25) me2 (cid:26) (cid:31) (cid:2) , 2 (cid:17) (cid:26) (cid:31) (cid:2) , 3 (cid:21) ! " # (cid:12) $ . Here the parameters (cid:23) are chosen so that interactions between nucleosomes within the nucleation and 251 looping region histones produce the highest contribution to feedback methylation , followed by the 252 contribution of NR and LR nucleosomes to methylation of other gene body nucleosomes . This is 253 consistent with the PRC2 enzymatic machinery localising mainly to the nucleation region . Also 254 consistent with this , we assume lower contributions from gene body histones to the methylation of NR 255 and LR nucleosomes , and the lowest contribution from interactions between gene body histones . 256 Hence , we set the above parameters as follows : 257 (cid:23) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:29)(cid:30) = (cid:23) (cid:19)(cid:30)(cid:29)(cid:30) = (cid:23) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:19)(cid:30) = (cid:23) (cid:19)(cid:30)(cid:19)(cid:30) > (cid:23) (cid:29)(cid:30) " # (cid:12) $ = (cid:23) (cid:19)(cid:30) " # (cid:12) $ > (cid:23) " # (cid:12) $ (cid:29)(cid:30) = (cid:23) " # (cid:12) $ (cid:19)(cid:30) > (cid:23) " # (cid:12) $ " # (cid:12) $ . 258 Following ( Berry et al . , 2017 ) , a background “noisy” removal of H3K27 methylation is also included 259 in the model , represented by the rate constant (cid:30) (cid:28)(cid:15)(cid:6) . 260 261 Dependence on an active cell cycle : To implement the dependence of H3K27me3 spreading on an 262 active cell cycle ( as observed experimentally in ( Yang et al . , 2017 ) ) , the total cell cycle duration is 263 divided into two parts : G1 and S / G2 / M , with replication of the locus occurring at the midpoint of 264 S / G2 / M . The duration of G1 is assumed to be approximately half the total duration of the cell - cycle . 265 The four parameters corresponding to interactions between the NR / LR and the body region ( (cid:23) (cid:29)(cid:30) " # (cid:12) $ , 266 (cid:23) (cid:19)(cid:30) " # (cid:12) $ , (cid:23) " # (cid:12) $ (cid:29)(cid:30) , (cid:23) " # (cid:12) $ (cid:19)(cid:30) ) are reduced by a factor of 10 during the part of the cell cycle corresponding to 267 G1 phase . 268 269 Spreading mutant : For simulating the spreading mutant ( clf - 2 ) , we lower the contributions from the 270 NR and LR nucleosomes to methylation of gene body nucleosomes ( i . e . , lower (cid:23) (cid:29)(cid:30) " # (cid:12) $ and (cid:23) (cid:19)(cid:30) " # (cid:12) $ ) , as 271 well as the contribution from the gene body nucleosomes to methylation of the NR and LR 272 nucleosomes ( i . e . , lower (cid:23) " # (cid:12) $ (cid:29)(cid:30) and (cid:23) " # (cid:12) $ (cid:19)(cid:30) ) . 273 274 De novo addition of H3K27me3 : In addition to the differences in PRC2 feedback mediated 275 contributions , the nucleation region ( first three nucleosomes ) is assumed to have a significantly higher 276 de novo contribution to the H3K27 methylation propensity ( (cid:16) (cid:8)(cid:9) parameters ) , consistent with evidence 277 for de novo PRC2 targeting to this region during early developmental silencing of FLC ( Shu et al . , 278 2019 ) . 279 H3K27me3 fractional coverage measure : Our previous studies of FLC silencing indicate that 280 nucleation region H3K27me3 alone can significantly repress transcription , with the body region 281 H3K27me3 making a relatively smaller additional contribution to repression . This finding is different 282 32 to the assumptions of Berry et al . , where both H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 could repress . 283 Furthermore , nucleation of H3K27me3 in the cold is sufficient to switch the locus to a digitally OFF 284 state , as seen by FLC Venus imaging in the roots ( Lovkvist et al . , 2021 ) . Potentially different 285 contributions of the nucleation and looping region H3K27me3 versus the body region H3K27me3 to 286 the transcriptional repression are captured by allowing a higher contribution from these NR and LR 287 nucleosomes when computing the overall fractional coverage of H3K27me3 : 288 (cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:27) % (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:28) (cid:5) (cid:29)(cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:27) % (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30) & (cid:19)(cid:30) (cid:17) (cid:15)1 (cid:30) (cid:29)(cid:20)(cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:27) % (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:28) " # (cid:12) $ 289 Here (cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:27) % (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30) & (cid:19)(cid:30) and (cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:27) % (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:28) " # (cid:12) $ represent fractional coverage of H3K27me3 in the nucleation 290 region / looping region and the rest of the locus , respectively , and 0 (cid:31) (cid:29) (cid:31) 1 . The overall fractional 291 coverage , (cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:27) % (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:28) computed above , is then used to determine the transcription propensity ( see 292 below ) . 293 294 Polycomb repression of transcription : H3K27me3 coverage across the locus is assumed to 295 determine the “transcription initiation” frequency , where the frequency is assumed to be a piecewise 296 linear function with a saturation threshold ( similar to the model in ( Berry 2017 ) ) . Note that this 297 frequency can also represent the transition of initiated Pol II into the elongating phase . Nucleation 298 region and looping region contributions to the fractional coverage are assumed to be higher than the 299 rest of the locus ( see above ) . H3K27me3 coverage also has the same effect on sense and antisense 300 initiation frequency . 301 (cid:5) ! (cid:15) (cid:8)(cid:15)(cid:11) (cid:30) ’ (cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8) ’ (cid:9) (cid:15) (cid:8)(cid:15)(cid:11) (cid:30) (cid:8)(cid:0)(cid:16) (cid:20)(cid:20) for (cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:27) % (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:28) < (cid:4) (cid:13) 302 and 303 (cid:5) ! (cid:8)(cid:0)(cid:16) for (cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:27) % (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:28) " (cid:4) (cid:13) 304 We also allow for a slightly higher transcription frequency in the H3K27me3 nucleated state 305 compared to a fully H3K27me3 spread state . This is consistent with our previous datasets , where FLC 306 transcriptional output is observed to reduce further during the post - cold transition to a spread state 307 following nucleation . To enable this behaviour , we set (cid:29) (cid:31) (cid:4) (cid:13) so that the full silencing threshold is 308 not reached even with full coverage of H3K27me3 in the nucleation and looping regions ( i . e . , even 309 with (cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:27) % (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30) & (cid:19)(cid:30) (cid:5) 1 ) . 310 311 Published evidence based on sequencing of nascent RNA as well as our own qPCR data ( Wu et al . , 312 2016 ) indicates lower frequency of antisense transcription compared to sense transcription . This 313 difference between sense and antisense transcription is captured by using different values of ! for 314 sense and antisense initiation frequency . Note that H3K4me1 does not affect the initiation frequency . 315 316 33 Histone inheritance during DNA replication : For each individual simulation , the DNA replication 317 times are fixed deterministically , assuming a cell cycle duration of 22h ( Rahni and Birnbaum , 2019 ) . 318 At each DNA replication timepoint , the Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm ( SSA ) is 319 interrupted . We then iterate over the entries of the array S , where for each nucleosome at the locus 320 carrying at least one H3K27me , its modification state is set to 0 , i . e . , the pair of entries corresponding 321 to the nucleosome is set to 0 , with a probability of 0 . 5 . We assume here random inheritance of intact 322 H3 - H4 nucleosomes , with equal probability to each daughter strand . For each nucleosome , this is 323 done by generating a pseudo - random number from a uniform distribution ( 0 , 1 ) and setting the 324 corresponding histone modification states to 0 if the generated number is less than 0 . 5 . In contrast , for 325 each nucleosome carrying no H3K27me , the modification state is always set to zero , i . e . , no 326 inheritance of nucleosomes carrying only H3K4me1 . 327 328 Model parameter values : H3K27me Parameter Description Value used in model Details (cid:31) Number of histones 60 me PRC2 - mediated methylation rate ( histone - 1 s - 1 ) 8 · 10 (cid:30)(cid:31) me0 - 1 PRC2 - feedback mediated methylation rate ( me0 to me1 ) ( histone - 1 s - 1 ) 9 me me1 - 2 PRC2 - feedback mediated methylation rate ( me1 to me2 ) ( histone - 1 s - 1 ) 6 me me2 - 3 PRC2 - feedback mediated methylation rate ( me2 to me3 ) ( histone - 1 s - 1 ) me (cid:30) me2 - 3 Noisy methylation rate ( me2 to me3 ) ( histone - 1 s - 1 ) me / 20 (cid:30) me1 - 2 Noisy methylation rate ( me1 to me2 ) ( histone - 1 s - 1 ) me1 - 2 / 20 (cid:30) me0 - 1 Noisy methylation rate ( me0 to me1 ) ( histone - 1 s - 1 ) me0 - 1 / 20 34 329 Model parameter values : Nucleosome interaction parameters for PRC2 read - write feedback 330 331 Model parameter values : Transcription and PA site choice (cid:30) (cid:6)(cid:15) (cid:30) !

Simulations were 336 coded in C + + and compiled using Clang / LLVM ( version 14 . 0 . 0 ) . The Mersenne Twister 19937 337 algorithm ( Matsumoto and Nishimura , 1998 ) , implemented in the GNU Scientific Library ( GSL 338 version 2 . 7 ) , was used to generate pseudorandom numbers for the Gillespie SSA . The simulation code 339 can be accessed at : 340 https : / / github . com / gm1613 / FLC _ transcription _ coupled _ repression _ model . git 341 342 343 Initial conditions 344 In all cases – both for the analog module in isolation and the full model , the initial state was set to full 345 coverage of H3K4me1 . 346 347 Analysis of simulation output 348 Average levels of fractional coverage of histone modifications and average frequency of different 349 transcription events and termination site usage ( sense distal , antisense distal , sense proximal , 350 antisense proximal ) were computed by averaging over 500 individual trajectories . Individual 351 trajectories were started at random ( uniformly distributed ) times in the cell cycle to avoid having all 352 trajectories synchronised . To quantify switching to the digital OFF state ( which in the model can 353 correspond either to a Polycomb nucleated state or a spread state ) , we have to define what qualifies as 354 an OFF state . In our analysis we classify an OFF state as any state for which : 355 (cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:27) % (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:28) $ % (cid:4) (cid:13) where the parameter % is chosen so that % (cid:4) (cid:13) (cid:31) (cid:29) , and all the other parameters / quantities are as 356 defined above . This condition on % ensures that an H3K27me3 build - up in the nucleation region ( even 357 if this modification is absent across the rest of the locus ) , can be sufficient to qualify as a digitally 358 OFF state . In all simulation results shown , % is set to 0 . 25 . 359 360 Comparing simulation output to ChIP data 361 In Fig . 5E , we compare the model predicted H3K27me3 profiles at FLC in the L er parental genotype 362 and the Polycomb spreading mutant clf - 2 to the ChIP - qPCR measured profiles in these genotypes . To 363 do this we used an approach developed in ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) for comparing model predicted Pol II 364 profiles to those measured by ChIP . In our case , this method generates a predicted H3K27me3 ChIP 365 profile by combining the fully spatially resolved model predicted profile with the resolution limiting 366 effects arising from the sonication generated fragment size distribution inherent in ChIP based 367 measurements . Mathematically , this method involves a convolution of the full model predicted profile 368 with the probability distribution of fragment sizes generated during the ChIP experiment . Here we use 369 37 the same fragment size distribution estimated in ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) .
