Strategies vary widely in their effectiveness for promoting deep , long - term learning , 23 yet most students use ineffective strategies frequently . Efforts to educate students about 24 effective study strategies have revealed that knowledge about effective strategies is by itself 25 insufficient for encouraging widespread and lasting changes . An important next step is to 26 uncover factors that influence the decisions students make about study strategy use . We 27 explored the association between beliefs about intelligence ( mindset , universality , and 28 brilliance ) and study strategies . The most effective study strategies are error - prone , and beliefs 29 about intelligence carry implications for whether errors are a normal and even beneficial part of 30 the learning process ( e . g . , growth mindset ) or signs of insufficient intelligence ( e . g . , fixed 31 mindset ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that beliefs about and reactions to errors would mediate 32 a relationship between beliefs about intelligence and study strategies . We tested this 33 hypothesis by surveying 345 undergraduates enrolled in an introductory biology class at a 34 public , research - active university in northwestern United States . 35 Results : Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the internal structure of all measures 36 functioned as expected in our sample . We fit a structural equation model to evaluate our 37 hypothesized model . We found that mindset , but not universality nor brilliance , predicts 38 variance in both beliefs about errors and reactions to errors . In turn , adaptive reactions to 39 errors ( but not beliefs about errors ) are associated with the use of highly effective study 40 strategies and spacing study sessions . There was a significant indirect relationship between 41 growth mindset and spacing of study sessions . 42 3 Conclusions : Our results provide evidence for a mechanism explaining the association between 43 students’ mindset beliefs and academic outcomes : believing that intelligence is improvable is 44 associated with more adaptive reactions to making errors , which correlates with choosing more 45 error - prone and therefore more effective study strategies . Future interventions aimed at 46 improving students’ study strategies may be more effective if they simultaneously target 47 reacting adaptively to errors and emphasize that intelligence is improvable . 48 49 Key words : mindset beliefs ; study strategies ; error beliefs ; error adaptivity ; mediation model ; 50 lay theories 51 52 4 INTRODUCTION 53 Undergraduates must engage with their class content outside the classroom ( i . e . , study ) 54 in order to master the material . In undergraduate contexts , the manner and timing with which 55 students engage with the material outside of class is unstructured and managed by the student . 56 These decisions are highly consequential for students’ mastery of material and their academic 57 outcomes . Yet , students rarely receive explicit training or guidance about the most effective 58 ways to study and there is great variation in student study strategies and patterns ( McDaniel & 59 Einstein , 2020 ; Hartwig & Dunlosky , 2012 ; Karpicke et al . , 2009 ; McDaniel & Einstein , 2020 ) . 60 Research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience has generated an extensive body of 61 knowledge about the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning learning and the consequent 62 effectiveness of different study strategies ( Ambrose et al . , 2010 ; Brown et al . , 2014 ; Dunlosky et 63 al . , 2013 ; McGuire , 2018 ) . When students use ineffective study strategies , they undermine their 64 academic potential ( Lorch et al . , 1995 ) . Study strategies influence many features of student 65 learning , including the amount of time students spend studying , how effectively they use this 66 time , depth of conceptual understanding , and content mastery achieved ( e . g . , Pressley et al . , 67 1987 ; Runquist , 1983 ) . Ineffective study strategies cost time and do not effectively help 68 students learn . Plant and colleagues ( 2005 ) surveyed undergraduates and asked them to log 69 their study time and activities . They found that the amount of time students spent studying 70 only influenced GPA when the effectiveness of the study strategies were accounted for ( Plant et 71 al . , 2005 ) . Thus , academic outcomes could potentially be improved by helping students learn 72 about and ultimately adopt efficient study strategies . This may be particularly critical for 73 5 students who face time constraints in working towards their educational goals , such as those 74 with responsibilities to care for family and those who work outside of their studies . 75 Study strategy effectiveness 76 There are many learning activities students engage in when they study , and these 77 different study strategies vary substantially in how effectively they promote deep , long - term 78 learning ( Dunlosky et al . , 2013 ) . Broadly speaking , highly effective strategies are those that 79 involve retrieving information from long - term memory , referred to as retrieval or recall practice 80 ( Carpenter et al . , 2008 ; Dunlosky et al . , 2013 ; Roediger & Karpicke 2006 ) . These strategies are 81 also referred to as deep learning strategies ( e . g . , Floyd et al . , 2009 ; Sabah et al . , 2023 ) because 82 they are associated with deep learning – that is , forming connections between new and 83 previous knowledge , reflecting on knowledge , and creating understanding ( Biggs , 1987 ; Biggs & 84 Tang , 2011 ; Marton and Säljö , 1976 ) . In contrast , strategies that involve more passive 85 engagement with material , such as re - reading and highlighting , are less effective at promoting 86 learning ( Carpenter et al . , 2008 ; Dunlosky et al . , 2013 ; Roediger & Karpicke 2006 ) . These 87 strategies are sometimes called surface learning strategies ( e . g . , Floyd et al . , 2009 ; Good et al . , 88 2013 ) because they contribute to a shallow learning approach – that is , fixating on trivial details 89 and memorizing them , and lacking profound reflection ( Schmeck , 1988 ) . 90 The timing of study sessions , or study pattern , also impacts the effectiveness of studying 91 ( Dunlosky et al . , 2013 ) . Massing ( also called cramming ) , where students attempt to do a large 92 amount of studying in a short time period ( especially the night before a test ) , is a common 93 practice . However , spacing out study sessions ( also called distributed practice ) is more effective 94 6 for learning and retention ( Cepeda et al . , 2006 ; Kornell , 2009 ) . When students engage in 95 massed practice , they are working primarily from their short - term , or working memory . Spacing 96 study strategies is more effective because the passage of time allows the information to leave 97 working - memory and forces recall to activate and strengthen neural pathways in long - term 98 memory ( Ambrose et al . , 2010 ) . 99 The study pattern ( i . e . , timing ) and study strategies that students use relate to their 100 academic outcomes . Rodriguez and colleagues ( 2018 ) surveyed over 1 , 200 undergraduates in a 101 molecular biology course and found that those who reported self - testing and spacing had 102 higher course grades . Hartwig and Dunlosky ( 2012 ) surveyed 324 undergraduates about their 103 study strategies and academic outcomes . They found that students who reported self - testing 104 also reported higher GPA and that students who reported massing ( vs . spacing ) their study 105 sessions also reported using fewer overall study strategies . Williams and colleagues ( 2021 ) 106 surveyed incoming undergraduates about their study strategies and found that those who 107 reported self - testing also had significantly higher admissions GPA . 108 Undergraduates’ study strategies 109 Literature characterizing undergraduates’ study patterns indicates that students tend to 110 pack their studying time with inefficient study strategies while dedicating a disproportionally 111 low amount of time to more effective strategies ( Carrier , 2003 ; Hartwig & Dunlosky , 2012 ; 112 Karpicke et al . , 2009 ; Morehead et al . , 2016 ; Rea et al . , 2022 ; Van Etten et al . , 1997 ) . A meta - 113 analysis of students’ use of study strategies indicates that students most commonly report 114 studying by re - reading and highlighting , which are less effective strategies ( Miyatsu et al . , 115 7 2018 ) . Hartwig and Dunlosky ( 2012 ) surveyed 324 undergraduates ( 78 % freshmen ) and found 116 that 66 % of respondents reread their materials and 66 % tend to cram the prior night . 117 Morehead et al . ( 2016 ) found similar patterns in a sample of 300 undergraduates ; 67 % of 118 participants reported rereading their materials and 53 % of them tended to cram . In Karpicke 119 and colleagues’ ( 2009 ) survey of 177 undergraduates , re - reading was the most commonly 120 reported study strategy . Studies of community college biology students report similar patterns ; 121 students ( n = 52 ) reported re - reading material most frequently , followed by using flashcards and 122 then underlining or highlighting while reading ( Vemu et al . , 2022 ) . When students engage in 123 inefficient study strategies , they are potentially suffering opportunity costs by spending time 124 learning inefficiently . 125 Errors are a critical part of effective learning 126 The process of generating errors is central to the process of learning ( Mera et al . , 2022 ) . 127 More specifically , generative learning refers to the process of forming deep connections 128 between the new content and existing knowledge schemas , as well as rearrangement of neural 129 networks ( Fiorella , 2023 ; Fiorella & Mayer , 2016 ) . Making sense of new information involves 130 the generation of errors and of learning from these errors to address misconceptions , facilitate 131 conceptual change , and reinforce correct conceptions . Unsurprisingly , many of the effective 132 learning strategies linked to generative learning are the same , including self - testing , self - 133 explanation , and creating visualizations , all of which are essentially sense - making strategies 134 that result in deep learning ( Fiorella & Mayer , 2016 ) . Compared to passively reading materials , 135 errorful learning paired with corrective feedback is more beneficial to student learning and 136 retention ( Mera et al . , 2022 ; Overman et al . , 2021 ) . 137 8 Cognitive psychology research indicates that strategies that feel easy to students , such 138 as re - reading and highlighting , feel effective to students , yet are ineffective for actual learning 139 ( Deslauriers et al . , 2019 ; Dunlosky et al . , 2013 ; Kirk - Johnson et al . , 2019 ; Macaluso et al . , 2022 ) . 140 This false feeling of effectiveness is referred to as the fluency effect ( Deslauriers et al . , 2019 ; 141 Macaluso et al . , 2022 ) . In contrast , strategies that are highly effective , such as self - testing and 142 spacing , involve students making errors and can feel frustrating ( Deslauriers et al . , 2019 ; 143 Dunlosky et al . , 2013 ; Kirk - Johnson et al . , 2019 ; Macaluso et al . , 2022 ) . Because they feel 144 frustrating and are error - prone , these effective strategies can induce anxieties , negatively 145 impact self - efficacy , and be perceived as costly ( Rea et al . , 2022 ) . The fluency effect explains 146 that if students passively engage with their material many times , which is how many students 147 choose to study ( Carrier , 2003 ; Hartwig & Dunlosky , 2012 ; Karpicke et al . , 2009 ; Miyatsu et al . , 148 2018 ; Morehead et al . , 2016 ; Rea et al . , 2022 ; Van Etten et al . , 1997 ) , they develop an illusion of 149 competency ( Bjork , 1999 ; Kelley & Jacoby , 1996 ; Koriat & Bjork , 2005 ; Nyland & Sawarynski , 150 2017 ) . 151 Numerous studies with undergraduates have supported the misinterpreted effort 152 hypothesis —that students misinterpret expending greater effort as a sign of lower efficacy 153 ( Kirk - Johnson et al . , 2019 ) . Kirk - Johnson and colleagues ( 2019 ) conducted a series of four 154 survey - based studies in which they were able to demonstrate : ( 1 ) that students viewed 155 effective study strategies as more effortful and worse for learning , ( 2 ) mental effort indirectly 156 affected strategy choice via perceived learning , and ( 3 ) learners interpret high mental effort 157 required by effective strategies as a sign of poor learning . Deslauriers and colleagues ( 2019 ) 158 supported this hypothesis in a classroom - based experiment . They taught introductory physics 159 9 content to undergraduates using active - learning and traditional didactic methods . They found 160 that students taught by active learning learned more , but perceived that they learned less than 161 when they were taught by didactic methods . Similarly , Kornell ( 2009 ) found that students who 162 studied word - pairs learned more effectively with spaced practice , yet 72 % of the participants 163 believed that cramming was more effective . 164 There is also evidence that students believe massing study sessions is more effective 165 than spacing them out because massing makes the study activities feel easier ( Baddeley & 166 Longman , 1978 ) . Because spacing forces recall to activate long - term memory , it causes errors 167 and can reduce performance levels during the study sessions ( Bjork , 1999 ) . Therefore , students 168 often believe that cramming is more effective because it can result in higher short - term 169 performance , which they mistake for long - term learning ( Bjork , 1999 ) . 170 Educators have long acknowledged the productive role of making errors in learning and 171 embedded them intentionally in instructional strategies . Bjork ( 1999 ) coined the term 172 “desirable difficulties” to describe learning conditions that increase the cognitive effort 173 required and thus lead to deeper and more long - lasting learning . Productive failure is a 174 pedagogical approach that intentionally embeds desirable difficulties into learning activities by 175 tasking students to solve difficult , complex problems before they have been taught all the 176 necessary tools and information ( Kapur , 2008 ; Kapur & Bielaczyc , 2012 ) . Struggling with these 177 initial challenging problems helps students better learn and remember the information when 178 they are subsequently taught it and increases later performance on similar problems ( Kapur , 179 2008 ) . 180 10 Study strategy interventions 181 Some educators and researchers have attempted to leverage findings from cognitive 182 science to help students adopt more effective study strategies and thus reap better academic 183 outcomes . Rodriguez and colleagues ( 2018 ) conducted light - touch interventions in an 184 introductory biology course , consisting of a 10 - min lecture about the benefits of self - testing and 185 spacing and weekly reminders throughout the term that students should implement these 186 strategies . Compared to students in control sections , students who received this light - touch 187 intervention reported using self - testing and spacing at a higher frequency ( Rodriguez et al . , 188 2018 ) . Vemu and colleagues ( 2022 ) conducted a similar intervention in a community college 189 context , in which students received a brief lecture about effective study strategies and 190 completed an assignment that prompted them to reflect on their study strategies after each 191 exam . Students reported increasing using spacing and generating drawings as study strategies 192 ( Vemu et al . , 2022 ) . 193 However , not all study strategies interventions have been successful in shifting students’ 194 behaviors and improving academic outcomes ( Hattie et al . , 1996 ; McDaniel & Einstein , 2020 ) . 195 McDaniel and Einstein ( 2020 ) note that most study strategy programs and interventions fail to 196 improve students’ self - regulation and metacognition and that students fail to apply good study 197 strategies across various content and contexts . They detail numerous barriers that students 198 face in adopting effective strategies , including educational contexts focused on rote 199 memorization that encourage surface - learning strategies , the lack of timely and accurate 200 feedback available to studiers about the effectiveness of strategies they employ , and the un - 201 intuitiveness of effective study strategies ( McDaniel & Einstein , 2020 ) . One study found that 202 11 over 80 % of undergraduate psychology students reported that they do not follow their 203 instructor’s study strategy suggestions ( Kornell & Bjork , 2007 ) . Another study of 204 undergraduates found that students report understanding the benefits of spacing , but still 205 massed their study sessions frequently and engaged in inefficient study strategies , like re - 206 reading ( Susser & McCabe , 2013 ) . Studies of undergraduates’ metacognitive knowledge and 207 skills found that students sometimes choose to use study strategies that they know are 208 ineffective because they feel comforting during a stressful time ( Dye & Stanton , 2017 ) . In fact , 209 in their study , a student likened using familiar , ineffective study strategies to eating comfort 210 food ( Dye & Stanton , 2017 ) . Knowledge of the effectiveness of study strategies is not always 211 sufficient for students to change their habits , as many students make plans to study using 212 effective strategies which they are unable to follow through on ( Stanton et al . , 2015 ) . 213 The current study 214 A major challenge to improving students’ study strategies via interventions is that 215 knowledge of study strategies , by itself , does not spark widespread change in students’ study 216 behaviors ( Rea et al . , 2022 ; Stanton et al . , 2021 ) . Effectively encouraging students to adopt 217 effective study strategies will require an approach informed by the factors that influence 218 students’ decisions about how to study . Our study seeks to explore motivational factors 219 underpinning students’ study strategy behaviors . 220 Since errors play a central role in the learning process , we hypothesize that students’ 221 beliefs about errors and reactions to errors may influence how they choose to study . Prior work 222 has explored how students approach and respond to errors while learning . Tulis and colleagues 223 12 ( 2017 ) conceptualized and explored the beliefs students hold about learning from errors , called 224 error - related beliefs . Positive beliefs about errors reflect the attitude that one can benefit from 225 making errors in the learning process whereas negative beliefs about errors reflect the attitude 226 that errors are harmful and should be avoided . 227 Dresel and colleagues ( 2013 ) characterized two types of reactions that students have 228 towards errors : action - oriented and affective - motivational . They conceptualized action 229 adaptivity of error reactions as how individuals change their course of action in response to 230 making an error . For example , students may put in more effort next time and set goals , or on 231 the contrary , disengage and invest less effort . Affective - motivational adaptivity of error 232 reactions describes how making errors affects students’ motivation and emotions , and is 233 associated with students’ persistence , performance , and effort ( Dresel et al . , 2013 ; Grassinger 234 & Dresel , 2017 ; Kreutzmann et al . , 2014 ) . For example , a student may be more motivated and 235 have just as much fun in the class if they make errors , or they become less motivated and find 236 the class more threatening in the future . 237 To our knowledge , prior work has not connected error - related beliefs or reactions to 238 errors to students’ choice of study strategies . Given the central role of errors in effective study 239 strategies , we hypothesize that positive beliefs about errors and positive reactions to errors 240 would be associated with using more error - prone and effective study strategies , like spacing 241 and self - testing ( Figure 1 ) . 242 Students’ attitudes towards and reactions to learning challenges have been tightly 243 linked to students’ beliefs about the malleability of their intellectual abilities ( termed mindset ; 244 13 Dweck , 1999 ) . Mindset beliefs influence how students interpret their performance , including 245 failures and negative feedback ( Burnette et al . , 2013 ; Haimovitz & Dweck , 2016 ; Hong et al . , 246 1999 ; Smiley et al . , 2016 ; Schroder et al . , 2014 ; Sun & Huang , 2023 ; Tabibnia & Radecki , 2018 ; 247 Waller & Papi , 2017 ; Yao & Zhu , 2022 ) . In fact , Yeager and Dweck ( 2020 ) wrote in a recent 248 commentary that “mindset is a theory about response to challenges and setbacks , not about 249 academic achievement . ” When students believe that their intellectual abilities are fixed and 250 unchangeable ( i . e . , a fixed mindset ) , they interpret negative feedback about errors as an 251 indictment of themselves and their ability , and as a personal threat ( Burnette et al . , 2013 ; 252 Haimovitz & Dweck , 2016 ; Hong et al . , 1999 ; Smiley et al . , 2016 ) . This leads students to 253 withdraw from the threatening situation and reduces persistence ( Burnette et al . , 2013 ; 254 Haimovitz & Dweck , 2016 ; Hong et al . , 1999 ; Smiley et al . , 2016 ) . Thus , if students receive 255 negative feedback about their mastery of the content while engaging in error - prone learning 256 strategies , those with a fixed mindset might choose to discontinue using those strategies . In 257 contrast , students who believe their abilities can improve ( i . e . , a growth mindset ) see negative 258 feedback about their mastery as a normal part of the learning process and useful information to 259 direct their efforts ( Burnette et al . , 2013 ; Haimovitz & Dweck , 2016 ; Hong et al . , 1999 ; Smiley et 260 al . , 2016 ; Sun & Huang , 2023 ; Waller & Papi , 2017 ; Yao & Zhu , 2022 ) . This trend is also 261 supported by neuroimaging evidence . Students with a growth mindset have shown higher error 262 positivity waveform response , which is the neural correlate of being more aware of one’s own 263 errors , more receptive of feedback , and having greater post - error accuracy ( Mangels et al . , 264 2006 ; Moser et al . , 2011 ; Ng , 2018 ; Tirri & Kujala , 2016 ) . In contrast , those with a fixed mindset 265 perceive critical feedback as a threat to their self - perceptions of ability and fail to demonstrate 266 14 deep processing of the feedback , leading to more subsequent errors ( Mangels et al . , 2006 ) . 267 These findings inform the so - called “social cognitive neuroscience” model ( Mangels et al . , 268 2006 ) . 269 Based on these theoretical linkages and prior work , we also hypothesized that students’ 270 mindset beliefs would be associated with their beliefs about errors and reactions to errors 271 ( Figure 1 ) . Specifically , we hypothesize that students with growth mindset would hold positive 272 beliefs about errors and react positively to errors , which should be related to their adoption of 273 highly effective , error - prone study strategies . In contrast , students with a fixed mindset would 274 hold more negative beliefs about errors and react negatively to making errors , and thus avoid 275 using error - prone study strategies which are highly effective . 276 Mindset describes only one type of beliefs students hold about abilities ( called “lay 277 theories” ) . Two other lay theories have been described in educational literature more recently 278 and are consequently less thoroughly studied . Universality refers to beliefs about whether 279 everyone ( universal belief ) or only some individuals ( non - universal belief ) hold the potential to 280 reach the highest levels of intellectual ability ( Rattan et al . , 2012 ; 2018 ) . Brilliance belief refers 281 to belief about the degree to which an innate , high ability ( brilliance ) is required for success in a 282 given field ( Leslie et al . , 2015 ; Meyer et al . , 2015 ) . Mindset , universality , and brilliance all 283 describe beliefs regarding intellectual abilities and success . Prior work has shown that they are 284 distinct beliefs and each uniquely predicts undergraduates’ psychosocial and academic 285 outcomes ( Limeri et al . , 2023 ) . This prior work revealed that universality and brilliance 286 predicted variance in most psychosocial and academic outcomes related to mindset beyond 287 what mindset alone was able to predict . While less work has been done on universal and 288 15 brilliance beliefs , the theoretical underpinnings suggest they may relate to how students 289 interpret and respond to errors . Students with a non - universal belief might view errors as a sign 290 that they are not one of the special people with unique potential . Thus , they may view errors as 291 threatening ( similar to those with a fixed mindset ) and have lower acceptance and poorer 292 response to errors than those with a universal belief . Similarly , we reasoned that students with 293 a strong brilliance belief may view errors as a sign that they do not have the brilliance required 294 for success . This view would make errors threatening and may motivate students to avoid and 295 have a negative attitude towards errors and react poorly to them . 296 Based on this theoretical connection , we also hypothesized that brilliance and 297 universality beliefs may influence students’ beliefs about and reactions to errors , and thus 298 study strategy choices ( Figure 1 ) . Specifically , we hypothesize that students with a universal 299 belief would hold positive beliefs about errors and react positively to errors , which should be 300 related to their adoption of highly effective , error - prone study strategies . In contrast , students 301 endorsing the non - universal and brilliance beliefs would hold more negative beliefs about 302 errors and react negatively to making errors , and thus avoid using error - prone study strategies 303 which are highly effective . 304 The current study aims to clarify the relationships among beliefs about abilities , error - 305 related beliefs and reactions , and study strategies . This work advances the field in several 306 important ways . First , to our knowledge , this is the first study to investigate the potential role 307 of beliefs about errors and reactions to errors as mediating factors between mindset and study 308 strategies . Second , we use a newly developed , context - specific measure of mindset for 309 undergraduate STEM students which has extensive evidence of validity and has shown higher 310 16 predictive capacity than previously available measures ( the ULTrA survey ; Limeri et al . , 2023 ; 311 unpublished data ) . Third , this work expands the limited literature on the role of universality and 312 brilliance beliefs – these are beliefs about abilities that have recently shown unique predictive 313 utility in explaining various undergraduate psychosocial and academic outcomes ( Limeri et al , 314 2023 ) . 315 316 METHODS 317 We conducted a quantitative study to test our hypothesized model ( Figure 1 ) . We 318 surveyed undergraduate students ( n = 345 ) from an introductory biology course at a university 319 in the northwestern United States . The survey included measures of students’ beliefs about 320 abilities ( lay theories : mindset , universality , and brilliance ) , beliefs about errors , adaptivity to 321 errors , and also asked students to report the study strategies and patterns they use . The study 322 protocol was reviewed and approved by the Texas Tech University Institutional Review Board 323 ( IRB2022 - 150 ) . Consent was obtained from participants on the first page of the survey . 324 Participants 325 We surveyed students enrolled in an introductory biology course at a public , selective , 326 very high research activity , primarily white university located in Northwestern United States . 327 The course enrolls ~ 500 students who are typically about half first - year students and half 328 upper - level students ( ~ 25 % second - year students , ~ 25 % third - and fourth - year students ) . 329 Students were awarded a small amount of extra credit for completing the survey ( or alternative 330 assignment ) . 331 17 We received 413 responses to the survey . We removed 13 incomplete responses . The 332 survey included two attention - check items ( e . g . , “This is a control question . Please select 333 “Strongly disagree” ) , located at approximately 1 / 3 and 2 / 3 of the way through the survey . Fifty - 334 five responses failed to select the directed response to one or both checks and were removed , 335 resulting in a final sample size of n = 345 . Our sample was mostly white ( 75 % ) , contained 336 disproportionately more women ( 68 % ) than other genders , and included more continuing - 337 generation students ( 70 % ) than first - generation students ( Table 1 ) . 338 339 Table 1 .

Note that counts may not add up 343 to the total number of participants if respondents declined to answer the question or selected 344 more than one identity ( e . g . , for race / ethnicity ) . 345 346 Data collection methods 347 The survey included measures of beliefs about abilities , beliefs about errors , error 348 adaptivity , and study strategies . The survey also included two attention check questions and 349 four demographic questions . The complete item set can be found in Supplemental Material 350 Section 1 . 351 Beliefs about abilities . We measured mindset , universality , and brilliance beliefs using 352 the Undergraduate Lay Theories of Ability ( ULTrA ) Survey ( Limeri et al . , 2023 ) . This survey was 353 developed specifically for use with undergraduate STEM students and is supported by multiple 354 types of validity evidence ( Limeri et al . , 2023 ) . The ULTrA is a 25 - item measure of growth 355 mindset ( 5 items , e . g . , “I can become excellent at applying knowledge to solve challenging 356 problems” ) , fixed mindset ( 5 items , e . g . , “At the end of college , my ability to analyze 357 information will be at about the same level that it is now” ) , universal belief ( 5 items , e . g . , 358 “Anyone could become as effective at learning as highly successful STEM students” ) , non - 359 universal belief ( 5 items , e . g . , “Only people with a natural talent can become good enough at 360 19 applying knowledge to solve the most difficult problems” ) , and brilliance belief ( 5 items , e . g . , 361 “Becoming a top student in STEM requires an innate talent that just can’t be taught” ) . 362 Beliefs about errors and error adaptivity . We used the measure that Tulis and colleagues 363 ( 2017 ) developed and collected supporting validity evidence for use with undergraduates . This 364 survey measures beliefs about learning from errors ( 5 items , e . g . , “Errors are important for 365 getting better in my class” ) , affective - motivational adaptivity of error reactions ( 6 items ; “When 366 I say something wrong in my class , the class is still just as fun for me as always” ) , and action 367 adaptivity of error reactions ( 7 items , e . g . , “When something is too hard for me in my class , 368 then it ' s clear that I need to prepare better for class” ) . 369 Study strategies . We measured students’ study strategies using a measure adapted by 370 Rodriguez et al . ( 2018 ) . This measure was originally developed by Morehead , Rhodes , and 371 DeLozier ( 2016 ) and was adapted by Rodriguez et al . ( 2018 ) and used with undergraduates . 372 Students’ use of study strategies is measured by asking students to select the top three 373 strategies they use from a provided list : “Absorbing lots of information the night before a test ; 374 condensing / Summarizing your notes ; Make diagrams , charts , or pictures ; Recopy your notes 375 from memory ; Recopy your notes word - for - word ; Reread chapters , articles , notes , etc . ; Study 376 with friends ; Test yourself with questions or practice problems ; Underlining or highlighting 377 while reading ; Use flashcards ; Watch / listen to recorded lessons either by instructor or from 378 outside source ( Khan Academy , YouTube , etc . ) ; Other : write in . ” Then , a separate item asks 379 students to select which better describes their study patterns , “I most often space out my study 380 sessions over multiple days / weeks” or “I most often do my studying right before the test . ” We 381 classified students’ study pattern as spacing or cramming based on their responses to these two 382 20 questions . Students are classified as using spacing if they selected the spacing option to the 383 second item and did not select “Absorbing lots of information the night before a test” as one of 384 their top three study strategies in the prior item . 385 We had relatively low rates of endorsement for many of the study strategies . Therefore , 386 we created an indicator variable to indicate whether a participant selected that they used any 387 highly effective study strategy . Based on prior literature on effective study strategies , we 388 identified self - testing , recopying notes from memory , and creating visuals as the highly 389 effective study strategies in the provided list . Therefore , a participant was classified as using 390 highly effective study strategies if they selected any of these 3 study strategies as one of their 391 top 3 study strategies . 392 393 Data analysis methods 394 Analyses were conducted in Mplus version 8 ( Muthén & Muthén , 2017 ) . First , a 395 measurement model was estimated to confirm the factor structure of the eight latent variables : 396 ( 1 ) fixed mindset , ( 2 ) growth mindset , ( 3 ) universal beliefs , ( 4 ) non - universal beliefs , ( 5 ) 397 brilliance beliefs , ( 6 ) error beliefs , ( 7 ) affective - motivational adaptivity to errors , and ( 8 ) action 398 adaptivity to errors . The measurement model also included two indicator variables , ( 1 ) spacing 399 study sessions and ( 2 ) using highly effective study strategies . Both indicators were coded as Yes 400 = 1 and No = 0 . From this measurement model , bivariate correlations were derived to 401 preliminarily assess the associations among all variables . 402 21 Following this , the hypothesized mediation model ( Figure 1 ) was tested via a fully latent 403 structural equation model ( SEM ) using Robust Maximum Likelihood ( MLR ) estimator . MLR 404 adjusts the model fit indices to account for non - normality , which is commonly found within 405 data using response scales of agreement , and was observed within the present data ( Li , 2016 ; 406 Zhong & Yuan , 2011 ) . Covariances among error beliefs , action adaptivity , and motivational - 407 affective adaptivity were freely estimated . To evaluate the fit of the data to the model , we 408 examined several goodness - of - fit indices . Specifically , the chi - square statistic , the Comparative 409 Fit Index ( CFI ) , the Tucker - Lewis Index ( TLI ) , the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation 410 ( RMSEA ) , the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual ( SRMR ) , and the Chi - square / Degrees of 411 Freedom ( DF ) ratio . A CFI and TLI value close to or above 0 . 90 , an RMSEA below 0 . 06 , an SRMR 412 below 0 . 08 , and a Chi - square / DF ratio of less than 2 typically indicate a good model fit ( Hu & 413 Bentler , 1999 ) . Indirect effects were assessed using percentile bootstrap confidence intervals by 414 recalculating the model with 1 , 000 resamples . In so doing , the indirect effect is based on the 415 distribution of the resampled estimates versus a single product value , and thus , is likely to be 416 more reliable than alternative estimates ( Tibbe & Montoya , 2022 ) . 417 418 RESULTS 419 Descriptive statistics 420 More than half of our participants ( 208 / 345 ; 60 % ) indicated they use at least one highly 421 effective study strategy : self - testing , recopying notes from memory , or creating visuals . The 422 most common study strategy reported by our participants was self - testing ( 167 / 345 ; 48 % ) , 423 22 followed by re - reading material ( 141 / 345 ; 41 % ) , condensing / summarizing notes ( 131 / 345 ; 424 38 % ) , and watching lectures and videos ( 125 / 345 ; 36 % ) . The least commonly used strategies 425 were recopying notes from memory ( 26 / 345 ; 7 . 5 % ) , recopying notes word - for - word ( 47 / 345 ; 426 14 % ) , creating visuals ( 47 / 345 ; 14 % ) , underlining and highlighting while reading ( 49 / 345 ; 14 % ) , 427 and using flashcards ( 97 / 345 ; 28 % ) . A minority of our participants ( 119 / 338 ; 35 % ) indicated 428 that they space their study sessions out across time . 429 430 Preliminary Results – Measurement Model 431 The measurement model fit the data adequately : χ 2 ( 902 ) = 1 , 517 . 95 , p < . 001 , χ 2 / df = 432 1 . 68 ; RMSEA = 0 . 044 , 90 % CI [ 0 . 041 , 0 . 048 ] ; CFI = 0 . 91 ; TLI = 0 . 90 ; SRMR = 0 . 05 , with all item 433 loadings at or above 0 . 48 . This provides evidence of validity based on internal structure , 434 suggesting that our measures functioned as expected in our sample . We assessed reliability by 435 estimating the McDonald’s Omega , which describes the proportion of the covariances among 436 the indicators accounted for by the latent variable ( McDonald . , 1999 ) . The omega of each 437 measure used in this study was > 0 . 6 , demonstrating acceptable reliability ( Table 2 ; Hayes & 438 Coutts , 2020 ) . 439 Table 2 presents the bivariate correlations from the measurement model . The 440 associations were largely in the expected directions . All five lay theories correlated in the 441 predicted directions with beliefs about errors and both types of reactions to errors . 442 Additionally , fixed and growth mindset both significantly correlated in the expected directions 443 with the use of both spacing study patterns and highly effective study strategies . Action 444 23 adaptivity was positively associated with both spacing study patterns and using highly effective 445 study strategies . Interestingly , affective - motivational adaptivity was only positively associated 446 with spacing study patterns . Counter to our expectations , beliefs about errors were not 447 associated with either the use of spacing study patterns or high utility study strategies . 448 449 Find table 2 in landscape orientation at end of document 450 451 Primary Analysis – Mediational Model 452 Our hypothesized model fit the data adequately : χ 2 ( 912 ) = 1 , 535 . 90 , p < . 001 , χ 2 / df = 453 1 . 68 ; RMSEA = 0 . 045 , 90 % CI [ 0 . 041 , 0 . 048 ] ; CFI = 0 . 91 ; TLI = 0 . 90 ; SRMR = 0 . 05 . Significant 454 parameter estimates are presented in Figure 2 and all parameter estimates are available in 455 Supplemental Material Section 2 . As we hypothesized , fixed mindset was negatively associated 456 with error beliefs and growth mindset was positively associated with both action and affective - 457 motivational adaptivity . However , contrary to our hypothesis , universality , non - universality , 458 and brilliance beliefs were not associated with error beliefs or adaptivity , either action or 459 affective - motivational . 460 In alignment with our hypothesized model , action adaptivity was significantly positively 461 associated with spacing out study sessions and using effective study strategies . However , 462 contrary to our relationship , neither affective - motivational adaptivity nor error beliefs related 463 to spacing or using highly effective study strategies . 464 24 We evaluated the indirect effects between growth mindset and spacing and using 465 effective study strategies via traditional hypothesis testing as well as percentile bootstrap 466 confidence intervals . We found that growth mindset significantly contributed to students’ 467 spacing their study sessions through their action adaptivity toward errors ( β = 0 . 06 , 95 % 468 CI [ 0 . 02 , 0 . 13 ] , p = 0 . 028 ) . Growth mindset contributed to students’ use of highly - effective study 469 strategies through their action adaptivity toward errors ( β = 0 . 05 , 95 % CI [ 0 . 01 , 0 . 12 ] , p = 0 . 073 ) . 470 Importantly , due to the non - significant p - value for the second indirect effect , caution is merited 471 in interpreting this finding . 472 DISCUSSION 473 Our results illuminate factors that relate to students’ use of effective study strategies . 474 We found that growth mindset indirectly related to students’ study patterns , and that this 475 relationship is mediated by their adaptivity to errors . However , contrary to our hypothesis , 476 universality and brilliance beliefs did not relate to students’ beliefs about errors , reactions to 477 errors , or study strategies , and students’ beliefs about errors and motivational - affective 478 adaptivity did not relate to their study patterns or strategies . 479 This study contributes to the growing literature base exploring mechanisms through 480 which beliefs about abilities influence students’ academic outcomes . There is extensive prior 481 research on the mechanisms through which beliefs about the malleability of intelligence 482 ( mindset ) influence academic outcomes . These mechanisms include self - regulatory processes 483 including goal setting , operating , and monitoring ( Burnette et al . , 2013 ; Yan & Wang , 2021 ) , and 484 willingness to accept feedback ( e . g . , Sun & Huang , 2023 ) . Our results add to growing evidence 485 25 for a new mechanism : students’ reactions to errors and study strategies . Our results suggest 486 that students who believe their intellectual abilities can improve are more likely to respond 487 adaptively to making errors in the learning process and are more likely to space their study 488 sessions out and use highly effective , error - prone study strategies . This finding corroborates 489 prior work by Yan and Wang ( 2021 ) which found that intelligence mindset was indirectly related 490 to studying behaviors , linked by goal orientation , which positively related to both growth 491 mindset and use of effective study strategies . Our findings also build on prior work by Ng 492 ( 2018 ) , which provided neuroscientific evidence that individuals with stronger growth mindset 493 pay more attention to errors and learn more from them . 494 Our study also explored possible effects of beliefs about distribution of potential 495 ( universality beliefs ) and whether high intellectual ability is required for success ( brilliance 496 belief ) on study strategies . Contrary to our expectations , we found that neither universality nor 497 brilliance were related to beliefs about and reactions to errors as well as study patterns and 498 strategies . Our results indicate that some beliefs about abilities relate to study strategy use , but 499 not others . This corroborates prior research indicating that mindset , universality , and brilliance 500 uniquely relate to different psychosocial and academic outcomes ( Limeri et al . , 2023 ) . Our 501 results provide further evidence that these beliefs have different modes of action ( mediators ) 502 through which they impact students’ outcomes . Future work should continue to explore which 503 mediators and outcomes are influenced by each of the three lay theories about abilities and 504 explore the mechanisms underlying these differential connections . 505 These results may potentially be used to inform the design of study strategy 506 interventions to improve students’ academic success by encouraging students to respond 507 26 adaptively to making errors during their learning . Interventions targeting study strategies have 508 had mixed success ( McDaniel & Einstein , 2020 ) . Research has found that educating students 509 about the effectiveness of strategies is by itself insufficient to motivate behavioral change 510 ( Biwer et al . , 2020 ; Dye & Stanton , 2017 ; Morehead et al . , 2016 ; Rea et al . , 2022 ) . McDaniel and 511 Einstein ( 2020 ) conceptualized the knowledge , belief , commitment , and planning ( KBCP ) 512 framework , which posits that knowledge is only a first step , but students must also be 513 persuaded that effective study strategies will work better , commit to using effective strategies , 514 and create a feasible plan for using effective strategies ( McDaniel & Einstein , 2020 ) . Our results 515 suggest that helping students respond positively to making errors may be another important 516 part of helping them adopt effective learning strategies . Incorporating elements about 517 responding adaptively to making errors while learning and growth mindset may increase the 518 efficacy of interventions . It will be important to test if incorporating these elements into 519 interventions will increase their success . 520 Our results suggest that future studies investigating student learning and study 521 strategies should consider students’ views of their abilities and their adaptive reactions to 522 errors . Rea et al . ( 2022 ) found that despite recognizing the benefits of more effective study 523 strategies like pretesting and interleaving , participants reported relying primarily on passive 524 strategies . Rea et al . ( 2022 ) identified barriers to adopting effective study strategies , including 525 perceptions that they are too time - consuming , require excessive effort , or having low self - 526 efficacy for using these strategies well . They also identified barriers to effective metacognitive 527 strategies ( i . e . , goal setting , help - seeking , study planning , and focus of time and effort ) , the 528 primary barrier being psychological cost ( i . e . , these strategies would induce nervousness and 529 27 anxiety ) . Future research should explore whether helping students develop positive beliefs 530 about and reactions to errors may reduce some of these perceived barriers or increase 531 students’ confidence that making errors is an indicator that they are studying effectively . Our 532 results suggest that simultaneously targeting growth mindset beliefs may prove fruitful since 533 they relate to students’ error adaptivity . Future work could develop and implement 534 interventions that target study strategies , the positive role of errors in studying , as well as 535 promote a growth mindset . This is promising because prior work indicates that mindsets are 536 malleable , even for undergraduates ( Limeri et al . , 2020 ) . 537 Helping students shift away from time - consuming , ineffective strategies towards 538 efficient and effective study strategies can benefit all students . We propose it is possible that 539 these efforts may yield disproportionate benefits for students who face the most barriers in 540 their educational journeys . While more privileged students may be able to compensate for 541 using inefficient study strategies by increasing the total amount of time they spend studying , 542 this option may not be available for students who face constraints , such as working to support 543 themselves and their family , or those with caretaking responsibilities . Thus , students who are 544 low - income and / or are caretakers for family may have the least time available for studying and 545 thus may stand the most to gain from using their time as efficiently as possible . There is some 546 evidence that study strategies may be particularly important for students who face additional 547 barriers in their education . DiBenedetto ( 2010 ) surveyed 248 undergraduates and found that 548 there was a stronger relationship between self - regulated learning strategies and college GPA 549 for first - generation students than for continuing - generation students . 550 28 There is some promising evidence that metacognitive interventions that teach students 551 about effective study strategies have potential to improve equity in student achievement 552 ( Muteti et al . , 2023 ; Rodriguez et al . , 2018 ) . Muteti and colleagues ( 2023 ) found that first - 553 generation students reported using self - testing and practice problems less often than 554 continuing generation students , but that a 50 - minute lesson about metacognition reduced this 555 gap . Rodriguez and colleagues ( 2018 ) found that the performance gap between white and 556 underrepresented minority ( URM ) students was higher when URM students did not self - test , 557 and reduced when URM students engage in self - testing . They also found that their light - touch 558 intervention was successful in encouraging all students , including URM students , to engage in 559 self - testing more frequently ( Rodriguez et al . , 2018 ) 560 Limitations and Future Directions 561 Our study is cross - sectional and as such we are unable to draw conclusions about 562 causality among the variables studied . We hypothesize a mediation model based on theoretical 563 linkages . For example , although we hypothesize that students’ mindset beliefs influence their 564 reactions to errors , it is possible that the reverse is true . Perhaps frequently engaging in self - 565 testing and making errors teaches students that their abilities can improve and consequently 566 strengthens their growth mindset beliefs . Future work could improve on this by collecting data 567 longitudinally to investigate causal relationships . Alternatively , future work could take a 568 qualitative approach to gain more insight into students’ reasoning for choosing their study 569 strategies and the role that errors play in their choices about studying . 570 29 Our study was conducted in a biology class at a single , primarily white university located 571 in the United States . Thus , our sample is limited in demographic diversity . Caution should be 572 taken in generalizing these findings to other student populations , including students in other 573 STEM disciplines , at different institution types ( e . g . , teaching - focused , community colleges , 574 minority - serving ) , with different racial / ethnic identities , and in different countries . For example , 575 previous studies have indicated that study strategy use differs across disciplines ( Chouvalova et 576 al . , 2022 ; Lawson , 1979 ) . Engineering students placed greater emphasis ( relative to biology 577 students ) on the importance of self - correction , and making multiple approaches and attempts 578 ( Chouvalova et al . , 2022 ) . It is possible that epistemic differences and differences in types of 579 problems typically encountered between fields relate to different beliefs about abilities and 580 approaches to studying . Future work should examine how the patterns identified here may 581 generalize to other populations and explore how these variables and processes interact with 582 students’ intersectional identities . 583 An important limitation is that we dichotomized study strategies as either highly 584 effective or not . An underlying assumption that we are making is that students who are using 585 study strategies traditionally identified as being ineffective , like using flashcards and rereading 586 material , are indeed using them ineffectively . Cognitive processes occurring during passive 587 study strategies that are traditionally categorized as ineffective , such as using flashcards and 588 rereading material , may involve higher orders of cognition like making connections and 589 retrieving prior knowledge . Miyatsu et al . ( 2018 ) identify some ways to implement flashcards 590 effectively , such as practicing flashcards several times before dropping them and having 591 multiple episodes of successful retrieval in order to strengthen their memory and reinforce the 592 30 content , as well as overcome the likelihood of inaccurate metacognition , and spacing out their 593 flashcard study sessions ( Kornell , 2009 ) . Even flashcards may be used effectively in some 594 limited circumstances ( Kornell et al . , 2009 ; Miyatsu et al . , 2018 ; Schmidmaier et al . , 2011 ; 595 Senzaki et al . , 2017 ) . We took a conservative approach of classifying study strategies that could 596 be used ineffectively as not highly effective , since their use is not a reliable sign of using 597 effective study strategies . With flash card use in particularly , studies suggest that most of the 598 time , students will stop practicing a flashcard if it is successfully retrieved once ( Miyatsu et al . , 599 2018 ) and typically , students resort to flashcards for lower - order processes like memorizing 600 vocabulary , instead of gaining a detailed understanding of a concept or knowledge application . 601 In fact , Hartwig and Dunlosky ( 2012 ) concluded that flashcard use is not related to students’ 602 GPA . 603 Likewise , we are also assuming that students who report using study strategies 604 identified as being effective , like retrieval and spacing , are indeed using them effectively . 605 However , with effective study strategies , certain nuances may undermine their effectiveness . 606 With retrieval testing , Wooldridge et al . ( 2014 ) found that this method is only useful for 607 questions that are repeated on the practice test and actual test but not for topically related 608 items , which indicates that perhaps retrieval testing is not as effective for transferring 609 knowledge . For example , a student using retrieval testing may be memorizing the questions 610 and solutions and in doing so , engaging in lower orders of cognition . Future studies could 611 investigate how students implement their study strategies and the factors that relate to the 612 quality of implementation of effective strategies . 613 31 614 CONCLUSION 615 We find partial support for our hypothesized mediation model . In alignment with our 616 hypothesis , we find that students’ growth mindset beliefs are positively associated with 617 reacting adaptively to making errors , which is in turn positively associated with spacing study 618 sessions and using highly effective study strategies . In contrast , we did not find support for 619 relationships between other types of beliefs about abilities ( universality and brilliance beliefs ) 620 and reactions to errors or study strategies These results build on the literature base exploring 621 the mechanisms through which students’ mindset beliefs influence their academic outcomes . 622 Our results also add new knowledge about the motivational factors that relate to students’ 623 choices about how and when to study . This knowledge could be used to inform the design of 624 future study strategy interventions , focusing not just on informing students about the 625 effectiveness of strategies , but motivating them to adapt positively to errors and enable them 626 to adopt effective strategies more readily . 627 628 LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS 629 CFA Confirmatory Factor Analysis 630 CFI Comparative Fit Index 631 DF Degrees of Freedom 632 MLR Robust Maximum Likelihood 633 RMSEA Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation 634 32 SD Standard Deviation 635 SEM Structural Equation Model 636 SRMR Standardized Root Mean Squared Residual 637 STEM Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics 638 TLI Tucker - Lewis Index 639 ULTrA Undergraduate Lay Theories of Abilities Survey 640 641 DELCARATIONS 642 Availability of data and materials 643 The dataset supporting the conclusions of this article is included within the article and its 644 additional files . 645 Competing interests 646 The authors declare that they have no competing interests . 647 Funding 648 This work was supported by start - up funds from Texas Tech University ( TTU ) and student 649 support was provided by The Center for Transformative Undergraduate Experiences at TTU . 650 Funders had no role in the conceptualization , design , data collection , analysis , decision to 651 publish , or preparation of the manuscript . 652 Authors ' contributions 653 33 AC contributed to data analysis and interpretation , and drafting the manuscript .
