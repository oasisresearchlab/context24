Monitoring changing social behavior is essential to provide reliable input data for 56 mechanistic models of infectious disease , which have been increasingly used to support public health 57 policy to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic . While some studies have reported on changing contact 58 patterns throughout the pandemic . , few have reported on differences in contact patterns among key 59 demographic groups and none have reported nationally representative estimates . We conducted a national 60 probability survey of US households and collected information on social contact patterns during two time 61 periods : August - December 2020 ( before widespread vaccine availability ) and March - April 2021 ( during 62 national vaccine rollout ) . Overall , contact rates in Spring 2021 were similar to those in Fall 2020 , with 63 most contacts reported at work . Persons identifying as non - White , non - Black , non - Asian , and non - 64 Hispanic reported high numbers of contacts relative to other racial and ethnic groups . Contact rates were 65 highest in those reporting occupations in retail , hospitality and food service , and transportation . Those 66 testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies reported a higher number of daily contacts than those who 67 were seronegative .

S . , including the closing of schools , workplaces , and 106 businesses , prompted abrupt and dramatic changes to social contact patterns . In the first months of 2020 , 107 reducing social contact was the only measure available to ‘flatten the curve’ and blunt the severity of the 108 early pandemic . A synchronous , near - universal decline in contact rates occurred across countries in North 109 America , Western Europe , and Asia in the Spring and Summer of 2020 , with mean daily contacts 110 dropping from 7 - 26 contacts pre - pandemic to 2 - 5 contacts per person in the early ‘lockdown’ period . [ 1 ] 111 Through Summer and Fall , as restrictions began to ease , contact patterns slowly rebounded . A key 112 inflection point occurred in November 2020 , when the first COVID - 19 vaccines became available , 113 signaling the start of a massive national vaccination campaign . Widespread vaccination reduced 114 individuals’ risks of infection and led to declining case rates and hospitalizations , contributing to 115 perceptions of reduced pandemic severity and leading to further relaxation of social distancing policies . 116 [ 2 ] Characterizing changing social contact patterns across this time period is critical to better understand 117 behavioral drivers of the trajectory of the pandemic and inform ongoing efforts to estimate the impact of 118 interventions . Systematic data collected in other countries has helped to explain the interplay between 119 contact patterns and transmission dynamics [ 3 , 4 ] , but studies of contact patterns in the U . S . during this 120 period draw primarily from convenience samples which survey unrepresentative segments of the 121 population . [ 5 , 6 ] 122 123 While some studies have reported on changing contact patterns throughout the COVID - 19 124 pandemic in the U . S . [ 1 ] , few have reported on differences in contact patterns among key demographic 125 groups . This is particularly important since the burden of the COVID - 19 pandemic has disproportionately 126 fallen on low - income and minority populations , with a heavier burden of COVID - 19 cases and deaths in 127 low - income and minority populations . [ 7 - 10 ] To date , research has suggested that such disparities reflect 128 limited capacity for these groups to markedly change their contact patterns to protect themselves and their 129 communities from SARS - CoV - 2 infection due to social and structural factors . [ 11 - 13 ] Indeed , studies on 130 neighborhood - level mobility support the notion that certain demographic groups were more likely to self - 131 isolate than others during the early pandemic . [ 14 , 15 ] Disparities in the impact of COVID - 19 persisted as 132 vaccines became available . Inequities in vaccine access and uptake have resulted in suboptimal 133 vaccination rates in many U . S . communities . [ 16 - 18 ] A person’s vaccination status , as well as the 134 vaccination coverage in their broader community , influences the real and perceived risk of infection , 135 shaping differences in social contact patterns across demographic groups as the pandemic continues . 136 137 Data are needed on contact patterns over the period of the COVID - 19 pandemic in the U . S . ; 138 ideally these data should be both nationally representative and investigate differences by demographic 139 groups . Such data are critical to illustrate a national picture of contact patterns driving the changing 140 epidemiology of COVID - 19 and provide robust data on the behavioral patterns that may be perpetuating 141 inequities in the impact of the pandemic . Specifically , unbiased estimates of contact will be useful in 142 parameterizing mechanistic models of infectious disease transmission , informing underlying assumptions 143 about the rate at which individuals come into contact with one another which are necessary to accurately 144 simulate spread of infection and the potential impact of interventions . In particular , it is important to 145 capture contact patterns in the period during which restrictions began to be substantially relaxed but 146 before the availability of vaccination in the general population and after in order to guide models aiming 147 to understand the role of vaccines in altering population - level transmission dynamics . With infectious 148 disease models increasingly informing both domestic and global policy , it is essential that the data 149 underlying models maintains fidelity to rapidly changing contact patterns , which represents one of the key 150 sources of uncertainty in COVID - 19 transmission models . 151 152 .

[ 19 - 21 ] As a part of this study , we collected information on social contact patterns during two 155 time periods : August - December 2020 ( before widespread vaccine availability ) and March - April 2021 156 ( during national vaccine rollout ) . We calculate nationally representative contact rates for the U . S . by 157 demographic group and assess the relationship between contact rates and SARS - CoV - 2 serostatus in both 158 periods . 159 160 161 Methods 162 Sampling 163 Sampling methods for the COVIDVu study have been previously described . [ 19 ] Briefly , we used a 164 national address - based household sample derived from the USPS Computerized Delivery Sequence File , 165 which covers all residential delivery points in the US . To achieve a total sample of at least 4 , 000 166 responding households , a total of 39 , 500 addresses were sampled . We oversampled households in census 167 tracts with > 50 % Black residents and households with surnames likely to represent Hispanic ethnicity . 168 [ 22 ] One household member aged ≥ 18 years was randomly selected and offered participation in the study . 169 Baseline surveys were conducted from August - December 2020 and a follow - up survey was conducted in 170 March – April 2021 . 171 172 Sample weights were used to estimate key parameters that represent the non - institutionalized , housed 173 adult population in the U . S . The COVIDVu study was approved by the Emory University Institutional 174 Review Board ( STUDY00000695 ) . 175 176 Survey and specimen collection 177 Consenting participants completed an online survey , which collected the age , sex , race , ethnicity , income , 178 household size , and occupation of participants . We also included questions about person - to - person 179 contacts on the previous day , which we adapted from previous , similar surveys . [ 6 , 23 , 24 ] We defined a 180 physical contact as any contact involving physical touch , such as a handshake , hug , or kiss and a non - 181 physical contact by an interaction in which the participant was within 6 feet of the other person and 182 exchanged three or more words . For each contact reported in the survey , participants were asked to record 183 the age of the contact and the location where contact occurred ( home , work , school , or other ) . Occupation 184 categories were adapted from those used in the 2018 American Community Survey and based on the 185 North American Industry Classification System . [ 25 ] 186 187 Participants self - collected and returned a dried blood spot ( DBS ) specimen to a central laboratory via 188 prepaid mailer . DBS specimens were tested using the BioRad Platelia Total Antibody test that targets the 189 nucleocapsid protein ( i . e . , IgA , IgM , IgG ; BioRad , Hercules , California ) . [ 26 , 27 ] 190 191 Statistical Analysis 192 193 We restricted our analysis to participants who completed the baseline and follow - up surveys and returned 194 DBS specimens from each period with valid total Ig result . Where missing , we imputed responses for all 195 variables involved in calculation of weights , including age , gender , race / ethnicity , and income . [ 19 , 28 ] 196 Using the survey weights , we calculated the mean and median daily number of contacts reported in each 197 time period , overall and by age , sex , location of contact , race / ethnicity , income , occupation , and SARS - 198 CoV - 2 serostatus . We performed two - sample t - tests and Kolmogorov - Smirnov tests for the difference in 199 contacts reported at baseline and follow - up , which assess differences in the mean and overall distribution , 200 respectively , of highly skewed data . For comparability with analyses of social contact from other 201 countries , we truncated data at 50 contacts per day per contact age group to report total contacts [ 4 ] , 202 though we explored other cutoffs to assess how the impact on our findings .

Of these , 3 , 112 ( 66 . 9 % of participants in the baseline survey ) returned a 210 follow - up survey and a DBS specimen with a valid total Ig result during the period March 2 - April 18 , 211 2021 . 212 213 Overall , the mean number of daily contacts was 13 . 9 ( IQR : 2 , 10 ) at baseline and 14 . 5 ( IQR : 2 , 11 ) at 214 follow - up ( p of two - sample t - test = 0 . 552 ) . ( Table 1 ) Physical contacts increased slightly from 5 . 9 ( IQR : 215 1 , 4 ) to 7 . 8 ( IQR : 0 , 5 ) contacts ( p = 0 . 322 ) , and non - physical contacts stayed similar ( 10 . 2 ( IQR : 0 , 5 ) at 216 baseline and 9 . 6 ( IQR : 0 , 6 ) at follow - up , p = 0 . 722 ) . Most contacts in both survey periods were reported at 217 work ( 65 % at baseline and 54 % at follow - up ) , with fewer contacts reported at home ( 17 % at baseline and 218 21 % at follow - up ) and other locations ( 17 % at baseline and 22 % at follow - up ) ; the fewest contacts were 219 reported at school ( 1 % at baseline and 3 % at follow - up ) . ( Figure 1 ) ( Of note , nearly all participants were 220 adults , so contacts at school were not expected to be common . ) While the distribution of contacts in all 221 locations was skewed , this skew was particularly apparent among workplace contacts ( 90 th percentile of 222 the distribution : 16 and 15 for baseline and follow - up , respectively ) . 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 .

The number of contacts did not substantially change 266 among 18 - 24 year - olds ( p = 0 . 461 ) , 35 - 44 year - olds ( p = 0 . 097 ) , and 45 - 54 year - olds ( p = 0 . 796 ) from 267 baseline to follow - up ; comparatively , contact increased among 25 - 34 year - olds ( mean of 16 contacts at 268 baseline and 23 . 3 contacts at follow - up , p = 0 . 030 ) . Contact rates among the elderly ( 65 + ) were the lowest 269 of all age groups and remained similar from baseline to follow - up ( mean of 5 . 5 and 6 . 0 contacts at 270 baseline and follow - up , respectively , p = 0 . 592 ) . The number of contacts among men were generally higher 271 than among women and were similar from baseline to follow - up ( 15 . 0 to 17 . 2 , p = 0 . 251 ) , contacts 272 reported among women were also similar between the two surveys ( mean of 12 . 5 and 11 . 3 at baseline and 273 follow - up , respectively , p = 0 . 158 ) . 274 275 Contact patterns were distinct across socioeconomic and racial groups in both surveys ( Figure 2 ) , but 276 showed little change from baseline to follow - up . Those identifying as Asian reported the lowest contact 277 rates ( 6 . 8 and 11 . 3 mean contacts at baseline and follow - up , respectively , p = 0 . 019 ) , and those who 278 identified as non - White , non - Black , non - Asian , and non - Hispanic ( ‘Other’ ) reported the highest contact 279 rates ( baseline mean : 25 . 5 , follow - up mean 28 . 2 , p = 0 . 838 ) . Number of reported contacts was highest 280 among those reporting annual incomes from $ 10 , 000 - $ 49 , 999 . The number of contacts reported at work 281 varied substantially by industry , with jobs in retail ( mean 92 contacts ) , accommodation and food service 282 ( mean 29 contacts at baseline ) , transportation ( mean 24 contacts at baseline ) , healthcare ( mean 16 283 contacts at baseline ) , manufacturing ( mean 12 . 3 contacts at follow - up ) , and education ( mean 12 contacts 284 at follow - up ) accounting for the highest levels of contact . 285 286 Participants with a positive serostatus had slightly higher number of contacts than those with a negative 287 serostatus in both periods ( 16 . 6 compared to 13 . 3 contacts at baseline and 19 . 6 compared to 13 . 7 contacts 288 at follow - up ) . ( Figure 2 ) Those who were seronegative at both surveys reported a lower mean number of 289 contacts than those who were seropositive at either survey ( 13 . 4 and 16 . 8 contacts at baseline and follow - 290 up , respectively ) . Those who seroconverted from baseline to follow - up reported a higher number of 291 contacts at both surveys ( 17 . 0 and 18 . 2 contacts ) than those who did not ( 13 . 6 and 14 . 1 contacts ) . 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 .

Moreover , we reasoned that the nature of 325 some occupations could reasonably lead to several hundred contacts a day . Very few participants reported 326 above the 50 per day per group limit of contacts ( 5 , or 0 . 2 % of participants , at baseline and 10 , or 0 . 3 % of 327 participants , at follow - up ) . When we used a truncation limit of 29 total contacts per day , consistent with 328 other previous studies of contact [ 23 ] , we found qualitatively similar results to those reported ( mean 7 . 7 329 contacts ( IQR : 2 , 10 ) at baseline to 8 . 1 contacts ( IQR : 2 , 11 ) at follow - up . A moderate number of 330 participants reported more than 29 contacts ( 220 participants ( 7 % ) at baseline and 249 participants ( 8 % ) 331 at follow - up ) . In general , those reporting a very high number of contacts reported them at work or at 332 ‘other’ locations . 333 334 Discussion 335 336 Overall , national contact rates in Spring 2021 were similar to those in Fall 2020 , with most contacts in 337 both surveys reported at work . The number of contacts reported was not uniform across groups , with 338 those identifying as non - White , non - Black , non - Asian , and non - Hispanic reporting high rates of contact 339 relative to other racial and ethnic groups . Contact rates were highest among those with lower incomes and 340 in specific occupational categories , including retail , hospitality and food service , and transportation . 341 While the number of contacts reported were mostly similar from baseline to follow - up , younger adults 342 ( aged 25 - 34 ) reported higher numbers of contacts at follow - up as compared to baseline . Finally , we found 343 that those testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies reported a higher number of daily contacts than 344 those who were seronegative . Collectively , these findings provide robust empirical evidence for 345 differences in social behavior among demographic groups , highlighting the profound disparities that have 346 become the hallmark of the COVID - 19 pandemic . 347 348 The ‘opening up’ of much of the U . S . in mid - 2020 saw the lifting of restrictive social distancing 349 measures put into place across much of the country at the beginning of the epidemic . Social contact 350 reached a nadir in Spring 2020 , began to rebound by Fall 2020 , and according to our findings stayed 351 largely consistent through Spring 2021 . Although pre - pandemic data on social contact is limited , 352 available data suggest that contact rates have rebounded to pre - pandemic levels , estimated at 12 - 14 353 contacts per day for the average adult . [ 29 , 30 ] The consistency of overall contact rates across these two 354 periods is ostensibly the result of a complex interplay of factors . The expiration of many local mitigation 355 policies in late Summer 2020 [ 31 ] likely prompted increases in contact , before the severe wintertime 356 ‘wave’ arrived in November caused contact rates to decline once again . Optimism about the introduction 357 of vaccines in early 2021 gradually began to counterbalance the caution prompted by rising case counts in 358 winter [ 2 ] . Together , these factors likely led to largely consistent social contact rates across the two 359 survey periods . 360 361 Our finding that social contact rates varied by demographic group in the U . S . has been shown in 362 smaller , less broadly representative studies [ 5 ] We found high contact rates among the youngest age 363 group , 18 - 24 year - olds , consistent with other data showing that this group typically reported lowest 364 prevalence of mitigation behaviors . [ 32 - 34 ] We also found that adults 24 - 35 increased their contact rates 365 the most from baseline to follow - up , which may reflect the opening of schools and workplaces over this 366 period , and later , increased contacts after becoming partially or fully vaccinated . Minority populations 367 and those with lower incomes reported high mean rates of contact . Together with the fact that the majority 368 of contacts at both baseline and follow - up were reported in the workplace , this is consistent with reports 369 that lower - income and minority groups were more likely to be classified as ‘essential’ workers , a 370 designation which may have required them to continue working in - person or to return to work shortly 371 after the most strict social distancing restrictions were lifted and prior to our baseline survey . [ 13 ] At least 372 some of this disparity in contact rates is likely due to inflexible and unstable employment situations that 373 are less likely to allow for remote work . Differential contact rates by job type were expected but striking 374 .

We found contact rates up to ten times the population average in occupations which involve 375 working environments that place employees in close contact with many other people , such as retail , 376 transportation , and food processing . Notably , workplaces in general are an important source of infection 377 and transmission risk for respiratory infections [ 35 - 37 ] and the industries associated with high contact 378 rates in our survey were the settings of several highly publicized outbreaks in 2020 . [ 38 , 39 ] Ensuring that 379 effective prevention measures are enacted in workplaces , where exposure rates are high , may 380 disproportionately reduce infection risk . 381 382 Finally , we found that seropositive individuals were more likely to report higher contact rates at 383 both survey rounds . Many studies have reported on risk factors for infection related to social 384 environment , which have included poverty and crowding . [ 40 - 42 ] We coupled behavioral information 385 with serological status in nationally representative sample to show that higher rates of contact are indeed 386 linked with previous infection status . Linking information on mitigation behaviors and serostatus will be 387 important in understanding epidemic dynamics as population - level immunity increases , which are 388 predicted to be characterized by highly localized outbreaks in space and time driven by ‘pockets’ of 389 susceptible persons . [ 43 , 44 ] 390 391 The availability of nationally representative data on contact patterns by demographic group fills 392 an important gap in efforts to accurately forecast and explain the trajectory of the COVID - 19 pandemic . 393 Traditionally , infectious disease models have rarely incorporated social factors , though they are 394 instrumental in determining disease risk . This is partially because of limited availability of data to 395 properly formulate models that track many population groups , but also because average population 396 models are often favored for their simplicity and greater ease of computation . However , accounting for 397 exposure differences between groups is a critical component of accurately modeling disease dynamics by 398 population segment . To date , most models that have aimed to explain differences in the burden of cases 399 and deaths by demographic group have used proxies of contact , such as mobility measured by mobile 400 phone location data , to represent the frequency of person - person interactions rather than data on direct 401 interactions . However , recent work has shown that during ‘lockdowns’ , mobility was likely to be a poor 402 indicator of contact patterns , calling into question the validity of this assumption . [ 45 ] Data on contact 403 patterns by race , ethnicity , socioeconomic group , and occupation provides the necessary granularity to 404 investigate disease dynamics driving sociodemographic inequities in disease burden . Indeed , modeling 405 studies that have investigated these questions have noted the lack of longitudinal social contact surveys 406 that would provide data to allow proper parameterization of models . [ 46 ] Systematically collected data 407 that is finely stratified by demographic group has to date been a major barrier to COVID - 19 research 408 efforts . [ 47 ] Collecting and making this data available to the modeling community can support the 409 development of more accurate models to inform public health policymaking on continued use of vaccines 410 as well as non - pharmaceutical interventions . As vaccine rollout continues and transmission becomes 411 increasingly concentrated among unvaccinated and undervaccinated populations , understanding between 412 and within - group interactions will be particularly critical to track trends in transmission over time and to 413 understand the potential utility of targeted interventions to mitigate population - level risk . 414 415 There were several limitations to this study . First , our response rates were low ( < 15 % ) but 416 standard for address - based surveys . For certain groups at risk of being underrepresented by our initial 417 survey responses , we intentionally oversampled to ensure that such groups were adequately represented , 418 and survey weights were used to help ensure the sample represented the underlying population . Second , 419 contact patterns may have changed over the period spanned by our survey ( four months in the baseline 420 survey , one month in the follow - up ) . In addition , our surveys were conducted before and after the winter 421 holidays , which likely saw transient increases in travel and contact rates ; we could not capture these 422 changes with our surveys . Third , differences in contact patterns on the state and local levels are likely to 423 be significant due to variation in the nature of and adherence to distancing and other mitigation policies as 424 well as differences in the speed of vaccine rollout and eligibility criteria .

With respect to the 426 contact survey , we asked participants to record contacts from one day ( the day prior to completing the 427 survey ) and we do not know to what extent this day might represent general patterns of contact . 428 Moreover , this prevents an analysis of whether reported contacts were unique on that day , or repeated 429 across days . Generally , a higher number of unique contacts would represent higher infection and 430 transmission risk . Fourth , we do not have information on mitigation measures relevant for each contact , 431 which impact the likelihood of transmitting infection during an interaction . Lastly , the age range of the 432 surveyed population limits the generalizability of these results to only adults , as there were not aa 433 sufficient number of participants under 18 to make conclusions about contact rates among younger 434 people . This also limits our view into school - based contact , which is potentially an important setting of 435 transmission . 436 437 As the pandemic continues , continued collection of curation of data on behavioural indicators by 438 key demographic groups can support the development of detailed COVID - 19 models that accurately 439 represent disease dynamics in varied sociodemographic contexts . Continued , systematic collection and 440 analysis of social contact data is critical to understand the past and future trajectory of the epidemic as 441 well as explain differences in disease burden by population segment and through time . Longitudinal 442 social contact data is particularly powerful alongside seropositivity estimates that are finely stratified by 443 demographic group , and can further support efforts to properly fit dynamic models aiming assess 444 interventions to mitigate the continuing impacts of the pandemic . 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 .
