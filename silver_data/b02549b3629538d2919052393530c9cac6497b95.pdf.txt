However , the physical principles underpinning the formation of a pattern of microlumens from a pristine adhesion and their subsequent coarsening are poorly understood . Here , we use giant unilamel - lar vesicles adhered to a supported lipid bilayer and subjected to osmotic stress to generate and follow the dynamics of hydraulic fracturing akin to those in cells . Using this simplified sys - tem together with theoretical modelling and numerical simulations , we provide a mechanistic understanding of the nucleation of hydraulic cracks , their spatial patterns and their coarsening dynamics . Besides coarsening , we show that microlumens can irreversibly bud out of the mem - brane , reminiscent of endocytic vesicles in cell - cell adhesion . By establishing the physics of patterning and dynamics of hydraulic cracks , our work unveils the mechanical constraints for the biological regulation of hydraulically - driven adhesion remodeling .

Some 2 of these processes rely on the ability of hydraulic pressure to selectively detach cell - cell or cell - matrix 3 adhesions . For instance , hydraulic cell - cell fracture is thought to determine the first stages of mammal 4 development , during which pressurization of the gaps at cell - cell junctions produce a widespread distri - 5 bution of small pockets , which subsequently undergo an actively guided coarsening process to form the 6 blastocoel 8 . Immediately subsequent stages of development involve further luminogenesis and water man - 7 agement between lumens 9 . In - vitro studies have shown that cell - autonomous 13 ; 14 , poroelastic 4 ; 15 , or os - 8 motically applied 15 ; 16 ; 17 pressure di ff erences can lead to patterns of pressurized pockets of various sizes , 9 from sub - micron cracks to multicellular cavities . 10 The nature of the pattern of hydraulically driven pockets should play a major role in determining the 11 subsequent shape of organs ( network of bile ducts ) , the resilience of the epithelial barrier under hydraulic 12 stress or stretch 4 ; 18 or the robustness of morphogenesis 8 . The formation of an initial pattern of hydraulic 13 cracks should be a largely physical process , which then cells and tissues may be able to control by biologi - 14 cally tuning in space and time physical parameters 19 . The physics of coarsening of an array of preexisting 15 water pockets has been studied 8 ; 20 . However , the physical principles controlling when and how a pattern of 16 hydraulic cracks emerges in the first place from a pristine adhesion remain largely unknown . 17 To identify these principles , we combine experimental observations on adhered lipid vesicles , with math - 18 ematical and computational modelling . The hydraulic fracture in embryonic tissues is driven by pressure 19 gradients established through active ion transport across cell membranes , followed by a passive compen - 20 satory e ffl ux of water into the cell - cell interstice 8 . To generate such pressure gradients in our artificial 21 system , we subject the vesicles to osmotic shocks and observe hydraulic fracturing dynamics akin to those 22 in cells . We present a comprehensive picture of the various mechanical and transport mechanisms control - 23 ling the formation of membrane hydraulic cracks , their spatial patterns and coarsening dynamics and show 24 how they can be controlled by the magnitude of pressure gradients , and the type and density of membrane 25 bonds . 26 Results 27 Hydraulic fracturing in lipid vesicles 28 In our default experimental setup , we study the hydraulic fracturing between a giant lipid vesicle ( GUV ) 29 adhered to a supported lipid bilayer ( SLB ) . Both the vesicle and the SLB , contain biotinylated lipids ( b ) at 30 a desired density ( 0 . 2 , 1 or 4 mol % ) . Once the SLBs are deposited on the glass substrate , they are exposed 31 to fluorescent Neutravidin - DyLight 488 ( NAV ) , which bind the biotin groups ( b - NAV bond ) . Excess NAV 32 is then washed from the medium . When the vesicles are added on top of the SLB they adhere to it by 33 forming b - NAV - b bonds ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Most bonds appear mobile , as confirmed by FRAP experiments , see 34 Supplementary Information ( SI ) . Consistent with previous studies on enrichment of mobile bonds in the 35 adhesion zone 21 ; 22 , we observe that the NAV fluorescence intensity between the two membranes is between 36 1 - 2 . 5 times higher compared to that on the bare SLB ( Fig . 1a and SI ) . 37 Vesicles that are stably adhered to the SLBs have the shape of truncated spheres ( Fig . 1a ) with a contact 38 angle of ∼ 120 ◦ and a diameter of the adhesion zone of ∼ 20 µ m ( Fig . 1a ) . Upon hyper - osmotic shock , 39 applied by rapidly increasing the concentration of osmolytes in the external vesicle medium , we observe 40 the formation of multiple fluid - filled pockets between the two membranes , which in cross - section resemble 41 spherical caps protruding into the vesicle ( Fig . 1a ) . The pockets vary in size and have a non - homogeneous 42 distribution ( Figure 1c , Video 1 ) . In the NAV fluorescent channel the pockets’ footprints appear dark ( Fig . 43 1d , Video 1 ) . The total fractured area , quantified by measuring the combined footprint area of the pockets , 44 reaches its maximum in few tens of seconds after the osmotic shock ( Fig . 1e ) . Thereafter it gradually 45 2 Figure 1 : Hydraulic fracturing of adhered lipid membranes . ( a ) 3D images of a vesicle bound to a supported mem - brane ( at 1 mol % biotinylated lipids ) before and after the application of a hyper - osmotic shock of 100 mM ; cross - section of the vesicle after the shock .

The dashed squares show pocket fusion ( white ) and pocket collapse ( red ) events . ( e ) Total adhesion area , total fractured pocket area , and intimate ad - hesion area over time . The intimate area is defined as total adhesion area minus pocket area . ( f ) Integrated fluorescent density of NAV in the adhesion zone over time . ( g ) Fluorescent intensity profile of NAV across a pocket along the yellow arrow in the inset . 3 decreases as a result of coarsening of the pocket pattern through either pocket coalescence or pocket collapse . 46 The latter has been interpreted as a process akin to Ostwald ripening during which the collapsing pocket 47 transfers its content to neighboring pockets by di ff usive water transport in the tightly adhered interstice 8 48 ( Fig . 1c , d , Video 1 ) . The total vesicle adhesion area increases simultaneously with the growth of the pockets , 49 reaching a plateau at later times . At the same time , the intimate adhesion area of b - NAV - b membrane 50 contacts also increases in the first tens of seconds but by a much lesser amount , followed by more gradual 51 increase as pockets coarsen ( Fig . 1e ) . We conclude therefore that upon hydraulic fracturing , the excess of 52 vesicle membrane area is recruited mostly in the growth of pockets , and not in a homogeneous growth of 53 vesicle contact area , as previously reported 23 . Similar vesicle fracturing is consistently observed for various 54 other osmotic shocks and bond concentrations ( SI ) . Passivation of the membranes using PEG - ylated lipids 55 to avoid non - specific adhesion 22 ; 24 does not a ff ect the formation of patterns of hydraulic cracks either ( SI ) . 56 Next we discuss the dynamic behaviour of bonds during hydraulic fracturing . The symmetric shapes of 57 the membrane pockets in our system and their wide footprint areas , remarkably resemble the microlumens 58 observed between embryonic cells 8 . Hydraulic fractures of various shapes have also been reported for 59 cells and vesicles adhered through immobile bonds 15 ; 16 ; 25 or via non - specific adhesion 26 . To establish the 60 role of lateral mobility of bonds in our system , we examine the NAV signal as a measure of bond density , 61 which drops to zero at the location of the pockets from the moment of their opening ( Fig . 1g ) until the 62 later stages . This suggests that as the membranes peel away and form pockets , the advancing contact line 63 of the pocket pushes away the strong , mobile biotin - NAV bonds , thus leading to a large pocket footprint . 64 During this redistribution , bonds are not broken and the overall number of bonds in the adhesion zone stay 65 the same as confirmed by the constant integrated NAV density measured over the whole patch area ( Fig . 1f ) . 66 Furthermore , the nearly uniform NAV fluorescence intensity during pocket formation suggests fast lateral 67 equilibration of bonds relative to the dynamics of pocket formation and evolution . 68 Theoretical model 69 To understand pattern formation and dynamics , we develop a mathematical model predicting the nucleation 70 and evolution of hydraulic pockets starting from a pristine adhesion patch and following an osmotic pertur - 71 bation . We first examine the adhesion strength by estimating the nondimensional number (cid:112) κ / γ / R 0 where κ 72 is the bending rigidity , γ the adhesion energy and R 0 the typical vesicle radius 27 ; 28 . For adhesion mediated 73 by mobile bonds , the e ff ective adhesion energy is the osmotic 2D pressure of bonds trapped within the ad - 74 hesion patch , approximated by γ = k B Tc where k B is Boltzmann’s constant , T absolute temperature and c 75 the number density of bonds 29 ; 30 . In our system , (cid:112) κ / γ / R 0 < 10 − 2 ( SI ) and hence vesicles are in a strong 76 adhesion regime 27 ; 28 , in agreement with the sharp contact angles and absence of noticeable fluctuations . We 77 thus neglect membrane bending rigidity and fluctuations , and model the unattached part of the vesicle as a 78 spherical cap of radius R and contact angle θ ( Fig . 2a ) . 79 Before the osmotic shock , the vesicle , the solvent , the osmolytes and the bonds are in thermodynamical 80 equilibrium 29 ; 30 ; 33 ( Fig . 2a and SI ) . Briefly , osmolytes cannot cross the semi - permeable membrane and 81 hence sustain an osmotic pressure di ff erence ∆Π = Π i − Π e between that of the external medium Π e and 82 that of the interior of the vesicle Π i = k B T N o / V with N o the number of trapped osmolytes and V the vesicle 83 volume . Instead , water can equilibrate across the membrane , and hence its chemical potential inside , which 84 is proportional to P i − Π i , is equal to that outside , leading to ∆Π = ∆ P . The hydraulic pressure di ff erence 85 is resisted by membrane tension following Laplace’s law 2 σ v / R = ∆ P . The edge of the adhesion patch is 86 also a closed semi - permeable interface , albeit of lower dimensionality , which allows lipids to cross but traps 87 bonds , whose number N b is assumed to be fixed ( Fig . 1f , g ) , and which exert an osmotic tension on the edge 88 resisted by membrane tension following a Young - Dupr´e relation k B Tc = σ v ( 1 − cos θ ) , where c = N b / S and 89 S = π R 2 cos 2 θ is the area of the patch . 90 Right after the osmotic shock , Π e suddenly increases by δ Π , bringing the system out of equilibrum . The 91 osmotic imbalance drives water e ffl ux through the membrane , changing the vesicle shape ( V , R , θ , S ) , and 92 hence modifying hydraulic and osmotic pressures in the vesicle , osmotic tension in the patch , and membrane 93 4 Box 1 : Theoretical model The adhesion patch on the SLB is a disk D ( t ) in the ( x , y ) plane of radius r ( t ) = R ( t ) cos θ ( t ) . The adhesion patch on the neighboring vesicle Γ ( t ) is described by the height function z ( x , y , t ) with ( x , y ) ∈ D ( t ) . Local areas on Γ ( t ) and D ( t ) are related by dS = jdxdy where j = (cid:112) 1 + [ ∇ z ] 2 . Here ∇ = ( ∂ x , ∂ y ) , whereas the surface nabla operator is ∇ S . Vesicle unknowns : Radius of spherical cap R ( t ) , contact angle θ ( t ) , tension σ v ( t ) , osmotic pressure Π i ( t ) and hydraulic pressure relative to that in the external medium P i ( t ) . Unknowns in the adhesion patch : membrane height z ( x , y , t ) ; osmotic pressure Π ( x , y , t ) and relative hydraulic pressure P ( x , y , t ) in the interstice ; tangential velocity v ( x , y , t ) , bare tension σ ( x , y , t ) and bond number density c ( x , y , t ) on the membrane Γ ( t ) . Bond distribution in an adiabatic approximation . Assuming bonds redistribute fast compared to osmolytes , water and membrane , and accounting for conservation of their number N b , the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution is given by c ( x , y , t ) = C ( t ) exp (cid:32) −V ( z ( x , y , t ) ) k B T (cid:33) subject to N b = (cid:90) Γ ( t ) c ( x , y , t ) dS ( 1 ) where V ( z ) is the stretching potential of a bond and the second equation determines the normalization constant C ( t ) . Mass conservation of water . According to conservation of incompressible water ∂ t z − ∇ · ( α z ∇ P ) + jK [ ( P − P i ) − ( Π − Π i ) ] = 0 in D ( t ) , ( 2 ) height changes must be balanced by lateral water flow following Darcy’s law v fluid = − α ∇ P with mobility α ( second term ) and by water permeation across Γ ( t ) with permeability K ( third term ) . Mass conservation of osmolytes . Assuming a simple van’t Ho ff relation , fast equilibration along z , integrating through the thickness and accounting for di ff usion and advection with fluid velocity following Darcy’s law , it reads ∂ t ( z Π ) − ∇ · ( Dz ∇ Π ) − ∇ · ( α z Π ∇ P ) = 0 in D ( t ) . ( 3 ) Tangential force balance accounting for variations in the 2D membrane stress and for friction reads ∇ S σ + 2 η ∇ S · d = µ v in Γ ( t ) , ( 4 ) where η is the membrane viscosity , d the rate - of - deformation tensor and µ the friction coe ffi cient . For a deforming surface , d = ( ∇ S v + ( ∇ S v ) T ) / 2 − v n k , where v n = ( ∂ t z ) / j is the normal velocity and k the curvature tensor 31 ; 32 . In our convention , the normal vector to Γ ( t ) points into the vesicle and curvature of a pocket is negative . σ is the Lagrange multiplier field enforcing membrane inextensibility 0 = ∇ S · v − v n H where H is the mean curvature . Normal force balance accounting for hydraulic and Laplace pressures and for bond traction reads 0 = P ( x , y , t ) − P i + σ : k − j − 1 T bonds in Γ ( t ) , ( 5 ) where the full 2D stress tensor supported by the membrane is σ = ( σ − γ ) g + 2 η d with γ = k B Tc the 2D osmotic pressure of bonds , and the bond traction on Γ ( t ) along z is T bonds = c V ′ ( z ) . Vesicle - scale mechanics and mass conservation . Mechanical force balance in the free - standing part is given by Laplace’s law . Force balance at the edge of the patch is given by a Young - Dupr´e - like equation k B T 12 π r (cid:82) ∂ D cd ℓ = ( 1 − cos θ ) σ v , where the right - hand - side is the average 2D osmotic pressure of bonds along the edge . Conservation of incompressible enclosed water imposes that the rate of change of volume of the vesicle is balanced by permeation in the free - standing spherical cap and in the adhesion patch , and conservation of inextensible lipids imposes that the total vesicle area remains constant . Finally , conservation of the number of trapped osmolytes N o imposes that Π i V i = ( k B T ) N o is constant . Boundary conditions at the edge of the patch . Because the edge of the patch is not an obstacle for water or osmolyte transport between the external and interstitial media , continuity of hydraulic and osmotic pressures provides boundary data , P | ∂ D = 0 ( external hydraulic pressure is reference ) and Π | ∂ D = Π e . Similarly , lipids can flow through the edge , and hence σ | ∂ D = σ v . Initial conditions . Starting from an equilibrium state for Π e = Π 0 e for all unknowns , we suddely increase external osmotic pressure to Π e = Π 0 e + δ Π at t = 0 and self - consistently solve all the equations above over time . Model parameters . Mass : number of bonds N b , number of trapped osmolytes N o , and vesicle surface area . Osmotic pressures : Π 0 e and shock magnitude δ Π . Membrane properties : viscosity η and permeability K . Bonds : stretching potential V ( z ) = k 2 ( z − z 0 ) 2 with k the sti ff ness and z 0 the resting separation . Interstice : Darcy mobility α , di ff usivity D and friction µ . To account for the fact that in detached regions , where c ∼ 0 , bare membrane tension and hydraulic pressure should equilibrate instantly , and hence friction and inverse Darcy mobility should vanish , we assume the relations µ ( c ) = µ 0 c / c 0 and α ( c ) = α 0 c 0 / c , where µ 0 and α 0 are reference values at the nominal concentration c 0 . 5 tension ( Π i , P i , k B Tc and σ v ) according to the principles outlined above . Because the excess osmolytes from 94 the shock can penetrate the interstice , water can also drain from the vesicle into the cleft and pressurize this 95 space . 96 To account for the physics of the adhesion patch , we develop a detailed model allowing us to determine 97 the osmotic and hydraulic pressures in the interstitial space , the bond density , and vesicle membrane me - 98 chanics ( its shape , tension and lipid flow ) . This model self - consistently couples transport and mechanical 99 phenomena in the adhesion patch and in the free - standing vesicle ( Fig . 2a , Box 1 and SI ) . Briefly , we align 100 the ( x , y ) plane with that of the SLB and assume fast equilibration of osmotic and hydraulic pressures in the 101 interstice along the thin z direction . Transport of osmolytes is controlled by di ff usion and advection of the 102 aqueous solution , Eq . ( 3 ) . To model water transport , we view the thin and crowded interstice as a porous 103 medium where water moves against gradients of hydraulic pressure according to Darcy’s law 34 . Then , bal - 104 ance of mass of the incompressible solution expresses the fact that changes in membrane height should be 105 balanced by lateral Darcy flow and by water permeation across the membrane , Eq . ( 2 ) . The fluid membrane 106 supports a tangential stress tensor including bare tension , the osmotic tension of bonds , and viscous stresses . 107 Variations in membrane stress generate tangential forces balanced by friction , Eq . ( 4 ) , which physically 108 results from the resistance to membrane flow posed by an array of obstacles , here the bonds 35 . Membrane 109 stress also generates a Laplace pressure normal to the membrane , balanced by the di ff erence of hydraulic 110 pressures across the membrane and by the traction due to bond stretching T bonds keeping the membranes 111 together , Eq . ( 5 ) . Consistent with our observations , we assume bond distribution adiabatically equilibrates 112 reaching a Boltzmann distribution , Eq . ( 1 ) . 113 Mechanisms of hydraulic fracturing 114 To theoretically understand the formation of patterns of hydraulic cracks , we discard linear stability anal - 115 ysis 17 given the lack of uniformity and the large perturbations in our system . Instead , we develop a finite 116 element method for the model above in its full nonlinearity without additional assumptions ( SI ) . In a refer - 117 ence simulation , we used parameter values consistent with our experiments and the literature , Supplementary 118 Table 1 and SI . 119 Starting from an equilibrated adhesive vesicle , our numerical simulations readily develop arrays of 120 hydraulic cracks upon osmotic shock application , which closely resemble our experimental observations , 121 Fig . 2b , c and Video 2 . Our simulations give us access to all physical fields with high temporal and spatial 122 resolutions , thus allowing us to examine in detail the initial stages of pocket formation . Right after the 123 shock , di ff usion from the outer medium rapidly increases the osmotic pressure in the margin of the adhesion 124 patch ( green map in Fig . 2b ) . Without time to change z ( x , y , t ) significantly , the last two terms of Eq . ( 5 ) 125 remain unchanged and hence so does P ( x , y , t ) − P i . As a result , the local increase of Π ( x , y , t ) is mirrored 126 by a decrease of water chemical potential across the membrane ( P − Π − ( P i − Π i ) ) in the margin , which 127 drives permeation e ffl ux into the interstitial region ( blue map in Fig . 2b , c ) . Very close to the edge , water can 128 escape to the outer medium ( black arrows in Fig . 2c ) . However , at a distance from it , water is hydraulically 129 confined by Darcy resistance and accumulates by increasing locally z . 130 The local swelling of the interstitial space stretches bonds , increases the traction they support , T bonds = 131 c V ′ ( z ) where V ( z ) is the stretching potential of an individual bond , and pressurizes the interstice . However , 132 increasing separation also decreases bond concentration according to Eq . ( 1 ) ( gray map in Fig . 2b ) , which 133 reduces the ability of bonds to resist pressure . This e ff ect can be understood by noting that bond traction 134 T bonds ( z ) = U ′ ( z ) derives from an e ff ective potential U ( z ) = − k B TC exp [ −V ( z ) / ( k B T ) ] , which even if 135 bonds visit a nearly quadratic potential with sti ff ness k , is non - convex and can sustain a maximum threshold 136 pressure P ∗ = √ k B Tkc at critical separation z ∗ = z 0 + √ k B T / k . Beyond this point , the bond ensemble looses 137 adhesion stability . Thus , from the interplay between permeation and hydraulic confinement , this condition 138 is met at a distance from the edge , leading to the nucleation of fractured regions devoid of bonds surrounded 139 by a region of intimate adhesion rich in bonds ( gray map in Fig . 2b ) . The theoretical system is initially 140 axisymmetric and remains axisymmetric up to the onset of fracture with a ring - like peeling zone .

Mechanical ingredients are illustrated on the left and transport ingredients on the right . ( b ) Snapshots of various fields at the adhesion patch and 3D view of the membrane . The blue map is permeation velocity ( nm s − 1 ) , proportional to the water chemical potential across the membrane , P ( x , y , t ) − Π ( x , y , t ) − ( P i − Π i ) . The green map is the osmotic pressure ( kPa ) relative to that of the external medium Π ( x , y , t ) − Π e . The red map is the hydraulic pressure ( kPa ) relative to the vesicle pressure , P ( x , y , t ) − P i , whose gradient is proportional to Darcy flow . The purple map is the net membrane tension σ − k B Tc ( kPa µ m ) , and the gray map is the bond concentration ( µ m − 2 ) . ( c ) Zoom of water transport in the interstice , with water permeation ( map ) and Darcy flow ( black arrows ) ; pockets are outlined in red color . ( d ) Zoom of membrane tension ( map ) and membrane flow ( white arrows ) . 7 however , rapidly splits into droplet - like spherical pockets as a result of a symmetry - breaking transition akin 142 to a Rayleigh - Plateau instability , Video 2 . 143 The formation of pockets locally relaxes hydraulic pressure ( red map in Fig . 2b ) , which drives Darcy 144 water flow towards pockets to sustain their growth ( black arrows in Fig . 2c and Video 3 ) . Bonds being 145 pushed away from detached regions , the remaining hydraulic pressure can only be resisted there by bare 146 membrane tension through the Laplace term , Eq . ( 5 ) , which recruits membrane area by lipid flows resisted 147 by friction ( white arrows in Fig . 2d ) , Eq . ( 4 ) . The sharp decrease in bond concentration at pocket margins 148 is paralleled by a sharp increase in net membrane tension σ − k B Tc ( purple map in Fig . 2b ) , which opposes 149 the lateral expansion of the pocket footprint . Hence , mobile bonds control both the loss of cohesion leading 150 to the nucleation of pockets when T bonds ( z ) ≈ P ∗ , and the lateral expansion of these pockets through k B Tc . 151 The nucleation and growth of the first row of pockets reduces hydraulic pressure locally , and hence this 152 pocket front e ff ectively constitutes a new edge of a smaller pristine adhesion patch ( red map in Fig . 2b ) . The 153 process then repeats with the nucleation and evolution of subsequent rows of pockets , Fig . 2b and Video 2 , 154 as long as the vesicle is su ffi ciently out of osmotic equilibrium to tear the adhesion apart . Our simulations 155 exhibit profuse coalescence as well as events of pocket collapse , further discussed later . 156 Principles of pattern selection 157 Varying various physical parameters such as D , α , µ , δ Π and N b , leads to a large diversity of fracture 158 patterns , in terms of localization , size and spacing of pockets , and dynamics ( SI ) . To systematically parse 159 these behaviors , we identify the main non - dimensional numbers controlling the process . 160 Pocket formation requires that the osmotic shock is large enough to pressurize the interstice beyond the 161 critical pressure of the e ff ective adhesion potential U ( z ) , hence defining the dimensionless osmotic shock 162 δ ¯ Π = δ Π / √ k B Tkc 0 , where the reference bond concentration is c 0 = N b / ( π R 20 ) and R 0 is the typical radius 163 of the vesicle and the adhesion patch . By either changing the magnitude of the osmotic shock or the number 164 of bonds , our simulations confirmed that δ ¯ Π predicts the nucleation of pockets ( SI ) . 165 Besides having a strong enough osmotic perturbation , pocket formation requires that this perturbation 166 di ff usively penetrates into the interstice fast enough compared to the time of overall vesicle osmotic relax - 167 ation by permeation τ osm = R 0 / ( K δ Π ) . This e ff ect can be quantified by comparing R 0 with the distance of 168 di ff usive osmolyte transport during τ osm given by ℓ di ff = √ D τ osm , resulting in the dimensionless number 169 ¯ ℓ di ff = √ D / ( R 0 K δ Π ) . In agreement with this rationale , our simulations show that if this number is large , 170 then pockets form throughout the adhesion patch . On the contrary , if ¯ ℓ di ff is small , pockets only form in a 171 small region close to the edge or do not form at all , Fig . 3a . More quantitatively , we find a linear relation 172 between ¯ ℓ di ff and the pocket penetration distance d pen normalized by R 0 , Fig . 3a ( inset ) . 173 The condition that ¯ ℓ di ff is large enough guarantees significant water permeation into the interstice , and 174 hence is required for pocket formation but not su ffi cient . For this e ffl ux to pressurize the interstice , it should 175 be opposed by hydraulic resistance , which can be quantified by the dimensionless hydraulic screening length 176 ¯ ℓ scr = √ α z 0 / K / R 034 . At a distance smaller than ℓ scr from the adhesion edge , water can easily leave the inter - 177 stice by Darcy flow . Thus , if ¯ ℓ scr is comparable or larger than 1 , we expect very low hydraulic confinement 178 and no pocket formation . For smaller values , we expect ℓ scr to determine the distance between the first row of 179 pockets and the edge , as well as the separation between subsequent rows of pockets . Furthermore , since the 180 dynamics of pocket growth requires water volume reconfigurations by permeation and Darcy water flows , 181 Fig . 2c and Video 3 , we expect ℓ scr to dictate the typical size of pockets . These arguments are confirmed by 182 our simulations , including a quantitative linear relation between the normalized distance to the edge of the 183 first pockets d edge / R 0 and ¯ ℓ scr , Fig . 3b . 184 Finally , lipid membranes being nearly inextensible , pocket formation requires recruitment of membrane 185 area from the free - standing part of the vesicle and pocket reorganization from nearby regions , Fig . 2d . 186 When the dimensionless hydrodynamic length ¯ ℓ hydr = (cid:112) η / µ / R 0 is ≪ 1 ( ∼ 10 − 4 in our system ) , the 187 dominant mechanism dragging membrane flow is friction , which hinders membrane tension equilibra - 188 tion 35 .

The inset shows the relative number of collapses and fusions during pattern coarsening as a function of ¯ δσ . Zoom plots show sequence where both fusion and collapse take place . The map on the right shows bare membrane tension right after nucleation , showing higher friction generates larger tension gradients . velop between the initial row of pockets and the edge of the adhesion patch , and hence have a charac - 190 teristic buildup time of τ mem = ℓ 2scr µ / δσ . On the other hand , we estimate the time for pocket growth as 191 τ growth = ℓ scr / v p = ℓ scr / ( K δ Π ) . Equating these two times and non - dimensionalizing by the osmotic tension 192 scale , we find the dimensionless quantity δ ¯ σ = µδ Π √ α z 0 K / ( k B Tc 0 ) characterizing the frictional opposition 193 to pocket growth . In agreement with these arguments , our simulations show that for small δ ¯ σ , gradients 194 in σ are small , and since γ = k B Tc is nearly uniform , all pockets exhibit similar contact angles ( Fig . 3c ) 195 supplementary to θ ( Fig . 2a ) according to the Young - Dupr´e relation . In contrast , for large δ ¯ σ , strong tension 196 gradients develop increasing towards the interior of the patch . Tension being large , the system develops 197 very large and shallow pockets that enclose water volume resulting from vesicle e ffl ux with very small ex - 198 cess area 17 ( Fig . 3c ) . Furthermore , the gradient of tension is mirrored by a gradient in contact angles . The 199 contact angles in our experiments are large , and hence we infer that our system operates in a low friction 200 regime . 201 Regarding the coarsening mechanism , our simulations exhibit coexistence of pocket fusion and collapse 202 ( Fig . 3c ) . For low δ ¯ σ , the number of collapse events is similar to the number of fusion events , whereas large 203 δ ¯ σ favors fusion as pockets grow by laterally expanding their footprint area . Compared to experiments , a 204 significant di ff erence is that in our simulations nearby pockets readily fuse , whereas observations of stable 205 9 Figure 4 : Hydraulic fracture patterns for various experimental parameters , quantified when all pockets have appeared and before they start coarsening .

Membrane appears in red and the NAV bonds in green . pairs of pockets at very close distance are common ( Fig . 1c , d ) . We attribute the barrier to pocket fusion to 206 the presence of trapped adhesion molecules between pockets . 207 In summary , the dimensionless numbers δ ¯ Π , ¯ ℓ di ff , ¯ ℓ scr and δ ¯ σ delineate non - generic conditions for pocket 208 formation , imposing conflicting requirements on various parameters such as size , K , δ Π or c 0 . For instance , 209 increasing K by embedding aquaporins in the membrane 23 reduces both ℓ di ff and ℓ scr , while pocket forma - 210 tion requires the first of these lengthscales to be large and the second to be small compared to R 0 . These 211 dimensionless numbers also control the nature and dynamics of the pattern of hydraulic cracks , providing a 212 means to estimate the poorly characterized transport parameters ( di ff usivity , water mobility and membrane 213 friction ) in cell - cell or artificial membrane adhesion clefts 34 . 214 Experimental control of fracture patterns 215 To test the theoretical predictions , we modify experimentally accessible parameters . We start by changing 216 the strength of the osmotic shock . As predicted by theory and simulations , we observe nearly no pockets for 217 the smallest shock , δ Π = 25 mM , whereas detached area increases with increasing δ Π ( Fig . 4a ) . However , 218 10 this increase of detached area does not take place throughout the patch and remains largely confined to the 219 periphery , consistent with the fact that ¯ ℓ di ff decreases with increasing δ Π . 220 We then change the bond concentration . A larger bond concentration increases molecular crowding in 221 the thin interstitial space , and hence should impair transport and reduce di ff usivity D 36 and Darcy mobility 222 α 37 . Consistent with reduced di ff usivity , and hence smaller ¯ ℓ di ff , pockets form in an increasingly narrow 223 peripheral region as bond concentration increases ( Fig . 4b - i ) . Also consistent with reduced Darcy mobility , 224 and hence smaller ¯ ℓ scr , pockets appear smaller , closer together and closer to the edge of the patch ( Fig . 225 4b - ii ) . 226 To examine the opposite regime of reduced molecular crowding , and hence of large ¯ ℓ di ff and ¯ ℓ scr , we 227 note that in b - NAV bonds the bulkiest molecule is the NAV protein . Therefore , intercalation of thin DNA 228 linkers between lipids and biotins not only increases membrane separation ( from 5 . 6 to 25 . 6 nm ) but also 229 reduces crowding . Consistent with this rationale , in adhesions with DNA - b - NAV bonds , pockets form 230 uniformly throughout the adhesion patch and are much larger , in sharp contrast with the fracture pattern of 231 an otherwise similar adhesion with b - NAV bonds ( Fig . 4c ) . 232 Pocket dynamics at GUV - GUV interfaces and at long times 233 In the following we discuss the evolution of pockets over longer times , and compare pockets formed between 234 vesicles and supported lipid bilayers ( GUV - SLB ) as well as between two vesicles ( GUV - GUV ) . Following 235 pattern formation , pockets on the GUV - SLB adhesion patch appear immobile for all bond densities and do 236 not change significantly their shape and size over a period of at least 6 - 7 min . Occasionally , we observe 237 coalescence between adjacent pockets and pockets collapse , especially for smaller pockets and those near 238 the adhesion rim ( Fig . 1 and SI ) . In systems with high water mobility , as in the case of the longer DNA - b 239 bonds , pockets remain immobile but they can discharge in the outer medium and collapse through water 240 di ff usion ( Video 4 ) . Pockets at the GUV - GUV adhesion patch on the other hand are highly mobile and 241 exhibit significant Brownian motion ( Fig . 5a - i , Video 5 ) . Over a comparable time period they coalesce into 242 a single large pocket , which can discharge its content and sometimes bud upon contact with the external 243 rim of the adhesion patch ( Fig . 5a - ii ) . Such enhanced mobility and coalescence are favoured for smaller 244 bond density and at lower osmotic shocks . Larger osmotic shocks lead to the formation of a packed pattern 245 of pockets with limited space for their di ff usion ( Video 6 ) . Our FRAP experiments show that the mobility 246 of lipids and NAV bonds is greatly reduced in supported vs unsupported membranes ( SI ) , and hence we 247 attribute impaired pocket mobility in GUV - SLB adhesions to substrate drag . For the same reasons , lipid 248 domains in ternary membrane mixtures are mobile in vesicles and immobile in SLBs 38 . Mobility of lipids 249 and NAV further decreases with increasing bond density 21 ( SI ) . 250 In addition to the coarsening through coalescence and collapse , we often observe pocket budding , both 251 from GUV - GUV and GUV - SLB adhesion patches ( Fig . 5b , c and Video 7 ) . Buds remain to hover in the 252 vicinity of the adhesion patch , suggesting that they are still connected to it , but are not reabsorbed within the 253 observation time . To understand the mechanism leading to closing of pockets into buds , we first examine 254 whether the lateral osmotic pressure of bonds may push neck edges to reduce bond density . Our observations 255 of GUV - GUV interfaces show that budding is accompanied by significant shrinking of the adhesion patch 256 area and by an increase in bond density ( Fig . 5d , Video 7 ) , ruling out this possibility . We then note that 257 transitions from shallow pockets to buds of comparable volume in an adhered membrane are generically 258 caused by an increase in excess membrane area or a reduction of membrane tension 17 . Since tension in an 259 adhered vesicle is determined by the strength of adhesion , we examine the GUV - SLB adhesion patch where 260 bonds are less mobile . At long times , we often observe membrane unbinding by bond breaking , detected by 261 a loss of NAV signal , as well as an accumulation of NAV bonds at the location of the buds ( Fig . 5c ( ii ) , and 262 SI ) . Furthermore , the process of pocket budding , shrinking of the GUV - GUV patch and loss of NAV signal 263 at the GUV - SLB interface , coincide with strong vesicle fluctuations ( Fig . 5c ) . 264 These observations show that our system transits from a strong adhesion regime with intact bonds and 265 reduced fluctuations before the shock and at the initial stages of pattern formation , to a weakened adhesion 266 11 Figure 5 : Long term dynamics of pockets at the vesicle - vesicle adhesion patch . ( a ) Coalescence of water pockets in the adhesion zone between two vesicles linked at 0 . 5 mol % biotinylated lipids and subject to 50 mOsm osmotic shock , i - 3D reconstitution of the adhesion zone , ii - cross - section images of the same adhesion zone some time later .

( b , c ) Budding of water pockets between two vesicles linked at 4 mol % biotinylated lipids and subjected to 100 mOsm osmotic shock at 30 ( b ) and 470 ( c ) sec after the shock . The insets show ( i ) a cross - section of the GUV - GUV adhesion zone and ( ii ) of the GUV - SLB adhesion zone . Scale bar in all images is 4 µ m . ( d ) Plots of the total GUV - GUV adhesion area and of the mean NAV fluorescent intensity in the adhesion zone , corrected for photo - bleaching , sampled at 10 di ff erent locations . The values in both plots are normalised to the initial values , where t = 0 is the time at which imaging starts ( approximately 30 sec after the osmotic shock ) . regime with bond breaking at the GUV - SLB interface and reduced tension , leading to prominent fluctua - 267 tions and budding at GUV - GUV interfaces . This phenomenology is reminiscent of earlier studies on the 268 behaviour of bonds under force - induced membrane detachment , where mobile bonds are displaced and con - 269 centrate in the shrinking adhesion patch , and immobile or less mobile bonds tend to break under a pulling 270 forces 24 ; 33 ; 39 . Furthermore , previous studies have shown that membrane fluctuations give rise to an entropic 271 repulsion force , which can modify the density of bonds and their e ff ective binding strength 24 ; 40 , and can 272 even trigger membrane unbinding in the case of low adhesion strength 41 ; 42 . We hypothesize that the re - 273 duction of membrane tension following pocket formation enables initially small fluctuations , which over a 274 long period of time can break a certain amount of bonds at the edge of the tight adhesion zone . Because the 275 length of this edge is increased by the presence of pockets , this mechanism is enhanced . Bond breaking then 276 reduces adhesion tension , leading to further reduction of membrane tension , enhanced fluctuations , thereby 277 establishing a positive feedback loop . Our experiments thus demonstrate a novel transition from strong to 278 weak adhesion mediated by hydraulic fractures ( in the GUV - SLB interface ) and a mechanism of irreversible 279 budding of hydraulic pockets driven by tension reduction ( in the GUV - GUV and GUV - SLB interfaces ) . 280 Conclusions 281 In this work , we study the hydraulic fracturing of lipid vesicles strongly adhered through mobile bonds upon 282 osmotic deflation . The resulting patterns of water pockets and their evolution resemble the process of mi - 283 crolumen formation and coarsening in embryonic tissues 8 . By combining theoretical modeling , numerical 284 simulations and experiments , we identify the physical principles controlling nucleation , spatial pattern and 285 dynamics of hydraulic cracks . The conditions for pattern formation are non - generic , and require an inter - 286 mediate degree of confinement of the adhesion cleft . If too confined , osmotic imbalances cannot penetrate 287 the interstice , whereas if insu ffi ciently confined , water e ffl ux can escape the cleft without compromising 288 12 adhesion . We further show that over time , the presence of pockets can weaken the adhesion patch , lower 289 membrane tension , and lead to budding of pockets , akin to precursors of endocytic vesicles in our minimal 290 in vitro system . 291 Our work provides a physical basis for reconfigurations of cell - cell adhesions . In general , biological 292 patterning and reshaping during development results from an interplay between mechanics and biochemical 293 regulation 43 . In the context of luminogenesis , our work identifies the physical rules enabling the initial 294 patterning of profuse hydraulic cracks at every cell - cell junction , on top of which the previously identified 295 mechanism guiding coarsening by gradients of cell surface tension can act to position the blastocoel 8 . For 296 instance , our results suggest that rather than hydraulic confinement by tight junctions at the cell - medium 297 interface , profuse cracking requires reduced water mobility throughout cell - cell adhesions in the embryo , 298 and that irreversible budding of pockets is avoided by su ffi ciently large cellular tension . In the context 299 of adhesion remodeling , our work suggests that such irreversible budding triggered by reduced membrane 300 tension may constitute a physical pre - patterning mechanism for endocytic vesicles , subsequently tamed by 301 known biochemical regulatory pathways 44 ; 45 . 302 Methods 303 Consumables 304 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( cap 305 biotinyl ) ( sodium salt ) ( b - DOPE ) and 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( lissamine rho - 306 damine B sulfonyl ) ( ammonium salt ) ( Rhod - DPPE ) were all purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , 307 AL ) and used without further purification . NeutrAvidin Protein , DyLight 488 ( NAV ) was purchased from 308 Thermo Fisher Scientific . Chloroform , trizma hydrichloride ( Tris·HCl ) , glucose and sucrose were purchased 309 from Sigma Aldrich . Microscope slides and cover glasses from VWR ( catalog no . 48366 045 ) were used . 310 For the preparation procedure of GUVs , we used Indium Tin Oxide coated glasses ( ITO glasses ) from 311 Delta Technologies ( no . X180 ) . Double stranded DNA carrying a biotin moiety on one side and a double 312 cholesterol anchor on the other side were gift from L . Di Michele lab ( Department of Chemical Engineer - 313 ing and Biotechnology , University of Cambridge , UK ) . The biotin moiety allows the DNA to bind to the 314 Neutravidin protein and the cholesterol functionalization renders the nanostructures amphiphilic and able to 315 spontaneously insert into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer membrane . 316 Substrate preparation and chamber 317 Glass cover slides were washed several times with isopropanol and ultrapure water ( 18 . 2 M Ω , 0 . 5 ppm 318 organics , Merck Millipore ) , dried with nitrogen flow and were then further cleaned by exposing to low - 319 pressure air plasma , at a pressure of 1mbar and power of 300 watts ( VacuLAB Plasma Treater , Tantec ) , 320 for 40 sec to render the cover - slide clean and hydrophilic . The experimental chamber was assembled by 321 sticking a PDMS spacer onto the cleaned glass substrate . The total volume of the chamber was 500 µ l . 322 Preparation of supported lipid bilayer ( SLB ) 323 SLB were prepared using vesicle fusion technique as described previously 46 ; 47 ; 48 . Briefly , a thin film of 2mg 324 lipids formed by 99 . 5 ; 98 . 7 or 95 . 7 mol % DOPC , 0 . 2 , 1 or 4 mol % b - DOPE , respectively and 0 . 3 mol % 325 Rhod - DPPE were dried in a vacuum dessicator overnight on the wall of glass vial . The following day , the 326 dried lipid film is rehydrated in lipid bu ff er ( 10mM Trizma base ; 150 mM NaCl and 2mM CaCl2 , pH ≈ 7 . 5 ) 327 to a final concentration 1mg / mL . The resulting suspension is then sonicated using a tip sonicator operated 328 in a pulsed mode at 20 % power for 10 min with refrigeration to generate small unilamellar vesicles ( SUV’s ) 329 from the lipids . The solution is then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 mn in an Eppendorf centrifuge to remove 330 titanium particles . SUV suspensions were stored at 4°C under nitrogen and used within a week . A dilution 331 of the SUVs suspension with lipid bu ff er at a 1 : 4 volume ratio is spread over the clean hydrophilic glass 332 13 cover - slide in a final 200 µ l volume created by the PDMS chamber ( see above ) . Incubation for about 30 - 60 333 min results in the formation of a supported lipid bilayer . The SLB was then thoroughly washed with glucose 334 solution having a concentration of 300 mM ( isotonic relatively to the sucrose solution in which the GUVs 335 have been prepared ) . This is done to remove unfused SUV’s and the lipid bu ff er . 336 Preparation of giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUV ) GUVs owing the same composition as that of the SLB were produced via electroswelling 49 ; 50 ; 51 . Briefly , 50 µ l of the solution containing the lipid mixture were dispersed on two titanium oxide - coated glass slides . The lipid coated slides were dried in a vacuum desiccator for at least 5 hours to ensure chloroform evaporation . The dried coated lipid slides are put together with a Teflon spacer to form a capacitor cell . The conductive side of the two slides were faced inward and fixed with a clamp to form a chamber . The chamber was then filled with 300 mM sucrose solution , and an alternating current of 10 Hz and 2V peak to peak amplitude was applied across the chamber and kept overnight . The GUV’s were then extracted from the chamber , stored in an Eppendorf vial and used within 2 - 3 days . Immobilization of giant unilamellar vesicles To bind GUVs to SLB with biotin - Neutravidin bonds ( b - NAV ) , the GUVs and SLB were prepared from the same lipid stock solutions of DOPC and b - DOPE as described above . Before vesicle adhesion , the SLB was incubated with an excess of NAV at a final concentration of 60 µ g / ml for 30 mn and then rinsed with glucose 300 mM solution to remove excess protein . Following that , 2 - 5 µ l of GUV solution was added to the chamber and incubated for 30 mn to allow the GUVs to sediment on the SLB and form adhesion site with each other . The solution is then washed carefully with 300 mM glucose solution to remove unbound vesicles . To bind GUVs to SLB with biotynilated DNA - Neutravidin bonds ( DNA - b - NAV ) , we followed the experi - mental procedure described in Amjad et al . 52 . The DNA constructs were stored in DNA bu ff er at a concen - tration of 5 µ M . SLBs and GUVs were prepared from a lipid mixture of 99 . 7mol % DOPC and 0 . 3 % mol Rhod - DPPE as above . The SLBs were rinsed with DNA bu ff er ( 300 mM ) ( Tris EDTA ( 1X ) ; 100 mM NaCl and 87 mM glucose ) instead of glucose ( 300mM ) . To achieve respectively 1 , 4 , 6 or 8 mol % b - DNA linker density in both SLB and GUVs ; 0 . 234 , 1 , 1 . 5 or 2 µ l of the DNA constructs solution was added together with 0 . 5 µ l of GUV solution to the SLB . The chamber was incubated for 1 hour to allow grafting of the DNA to the lipids . A desired amount of the NAV solution was then added to the chamber to achieve a ratio of NAV / DNA - b of 1 / 4 , and was left incubating for 1hour . This in theory allows all NAVs to bind 4 DNA - b constructs . The solution is then washed carefully three times with 300 mM DNA bu ff er solution . Osmotic shocks By the time GUVs were bound to the SLB , all samples had a final volume of 400 µ L . To subject the b - NAV GUVs to hyperosmotic shocks of 25 , 50 , 100 and 150 mM osmotic shocks , half of the volume of the cham - ber ( 200 µ L of the 300mM osmolarity ) was replaced by glucose solutions of 350 , 400 , 500 and 600 mM , respectively . For the DNA - b - NAV GUVs , the shock solutions were 350 mM ( Tris EDTA ( 1X ) + 100 mM NaCl + 137 mM glucose ) , 400 mM ( Tris EDTA ( 1X ) + 100 mM NaCl + 187 mM glucose ) ; 500 mM ( Tris EDTA ( 1X ) + 100 mM NaCl + 287 mM glucose ) and 600 mM ( Tris EDTA ( 1X ) + 100 mM NaCl + 387 mM glucose ) , respectively . The precise osmolarity of the shock solutions was measured for each experiment with an osmometer ( Os - momat 3000 , Gonotec GmbH , Berlin , Germany ) . After the addition of the shock solution , the chamber was covered to prevent further osmolarity changes due to evaporation . 14 Imaging and analysis The imaging of the adhesion zone between the SLB and GUV throughout the osmotic shock was performed with an inverted optical microscope Nikon Eclipse Ti - E and a 60x numerical aperture , oil immersion objec - tive in combination with an Andor camera Neo 5 . 5 sCMOS ( Oxford Instruments ) . The integrated perfect focusing system ( PFS ) in the microscope allows us to follow automatically the surface which change its focal plane during the application of the osmotic shock . The open source image processing package FIJI was used for the image analysis . The changes in the adhesion area and intensity in response to the osmotic shock are performed by first subtracting the background of the fluorescence images and then applying an appropriate thresholding to generate a binary stack . Analyze particle function was then used to obtain the total and intimate adhesion area and intensity . The parameters reported in the paper are averages calculated from at least 2 samples , with at least 3 vesicles each . Confocal images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 880 Fast AiryScan and a Plan - Apochromat 63x numerical aperture 1 . 4 Oil immersion objective . The three - dimensional ( 3D ) reconstruction using the confocal stack was done using a Fiji plugin ( ClearVolume ) 53 . We always closed the chambers during imaging of the vesicles in order to avoid convection and large - scale drifts . Simulations The equations describing the time - evolution of the system involve a set of fields ( z , v , P , Π , σ ) in the patch D ( t ) and the variables ( R , θ , P i , Π i , σ v ) representing the state of the vesicle ( see Box 1 ) . We integrate these equations in time in a staggered way , by first solving the equations for ( z , v , P , Π , σ ) with a backward Euler approximation assuming fixed values of ( R , θ , P i , Π i , σ v ) and then solving for the vesicle variables assuming fixed values for ( z , v , P , Π , σ ) . To discretize ( z , v , P , Π , σ ) in D ( t ) we consider a triangular mesh and use a second - order Lagrangian interpolation for ( z , V , P , Π ) and a first - order Lagrangian interpolation for σ where here V = v + v n N is the three - dimensional velocity of lipids . To recover z from V , we note that since ∂ t z = v n , we can approximate z ( t + ∆ t ) ≈ z ( t ) + ( V · N ) ∆ t . To compute the tangential velocity v , we project V onto Γ t . To solve the balance of forces on the membrane we follow the procedure detailed in 32 . The equations are then solved using a finite element method with the boundary conditions discussed in Box 1 and implemented in hiperlife 54 . References [ 1 ] Navis , A . and Bagnat , M .
