The impact of multiple representations on students’ understanding of vector ﬁeld concepts : Implementation of simulations and sketching activities into lecture - based recitations in undergraduate physics Larissa Hahn * and Pascal Klein Physics Education Research , Faculty of Physics , University of Göttingen , Göttingen , Germany Multiple external representations ( e . g . , diagrams , equations ) and their interpretations play a central role in science and science learning as research has shown that they can substantially facilitate the learning and understanding of science concepts . Therefore , multiple and particularly visual representations are a core element of university physics . In electrodynamics , which students encounter already at the beginning of their studies , vector ﬁelds are a central representation typically used in two forms : the algebraic representation as a formula and the visual representation depicted by a vector ﬁeld diagram . While the former is valuable for quantitative calculations , vector ﬁeld diagrams are beneﬁcial for showing many properties of a ﬁeld at a glance . However , beneﬁting from the mutual complementarity of both representations requires representational competencies aiming at referring different representations to each other . Yet , previous study results revealed several student problems particularly regarding the conceptual understanding of vector calculus concepts . Against this background , we have developed research - based , multi - representational learning tasks that focus on the visual interpretation of vector ﬁeld diagrams aiming at enhancing a broad , mathematical as well as conceptual , understanding of vector calculus concepts . Following current trends in education research and considering cognitive psychology , the tasks incorporate sketching activities and interactive ( computer - based ) simulations to enhance multi - representational learning . In this article , we assess the impact of the learning tasks in a ﬁeld study by implementing them into lecture - based recitations in a ﬁrst - year electrodynamics course at the University of Göttingen . For this , a within - and between - subjects design is used comparing a multi - representational intervention group and a control group working on traditional calculation - based tasks . To analyze the impact FrontiersinPsychology 01 frontiersin . org Hahn and Klein 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1012787 of multiple representations , students’ performance in a vector calculus test as well as their perceived cognitive load during task processing is compared between the groups . Moreover , analyses offer guidance for further design of multi - representational learning tasks in ﬁeld - related physics topics . KEYWORDS multiple representations , simulation , conceptual understanding , vector ﬁelds , physics , sketching , task - based learning , lecture - based recitations 1 . Introduction Mathematics and physics concepts are often represented in some form of external representation ( De Cock , 2012 ) . Thereby , diﬀerent forms of representation , multiple representations ( MRs ) , allow to express a concept or a ( learning ) subject in various manners by focusing on diﬀerent properties and characteristics . In complementing and constraining each other , multiple representations enable a deep understanding of a situation or a construct ( Ainsworth , 1999 ; Seufert , 2003 ) and , moreover , using multiple representations was found to have positive eﬀects on knowledge acquisition and problem - solving skills ( e . g . , Nieminen et al . , 2012 ; Rau , 2017 ) . Regarding the understanding and communication of science concepts , visual representations are particularly crucial ( Cook , 2006 ) . Following previous research , they can help to eliminate science concepts’ abstract nature and were shown to support students to develop scientiﬁc conceptions ( e . g . , Cook , 2006 ; Chiu and Linn , 2014 ; Suyatna et al . , 2017 ) . However , to beneﬁt from multimedia learning environments , representational competencies based on an understanding of how individual representations depict information , how they relate to each other , and how to choose an appropriate representation to solve a problem are required ( DeFT framework ; Ainsworth , 2006 ) . Without representational competencies , visual representations cannot fully unfold their potential as meaning - making tools . Additionally , learning with and mentally processing visual representations often places special demands on the visuo - spatial working memory , thus increasing cognitive load ( Baddeley , 1986 ; Cook , 2006 ; Logie , 2014 ) . Here , previous research showed that externalizing visuo - spatial information can provide cognitive relief ( e . g . , Bilda and Gero , 2005 ) . In this regard , sketching ( or drawing ) visual cues in multimedia learning has become an increasing scientiﬁc focus in recent years ( Ainsworth and Scheiter , 2021 ) . Following empirical ﬁndings , sketching allows to pay more attention to details ( Ainsworth and Scheiter , 2021 ) , thus supporting a visual understanding of concepts ( Wu and Rau , 2018 ) . Correspondingly , previous studies reported positive learning eﬀects of sketching activities in ( multi - ) representational learning environments , as they increase attention and engagement with the representations and help to activate prior knowledge , to understand a representations’ properties , or to recall information ( e . g . , Leopold and Leutner , 2012 ; Wu and Rau , 2018 ; Kohnle et al . , 2020 ; Ainsworth and Scheiter , 2021 ) . Typical sketching activities are copying a given representation , creating a visual representation with modiﬁed individual features or by transforming textual information into a drawing , or inventing a novel representation ( e . g . , to reason ; Kohnle et al . , 2020 ; Ainsworth and Scheiter , 2021 ) . Moreover , with respect to Cognitive Load Theory ( Sweller , 2010 ) which characterizes the limited capacity of working memory resources based on three types of cognitive load—intrinsic , extraneous , and germane cognitive load—sketching activities are able to promote a more eﬀective use of these resources ( Bilda and Gero , 2005 ) . In addition to cognitive relief provided by sketching in multi - representational learning , previous work demonstrated the added value of interactive ( computer - based ) simulations for the development of representational competencies ( e . g . , Stieﬀ , 2011 ; Kohnle and Passante , 2017 ) . As such , integration of simulations in multimedia learning environments foster active learning , thus supporting students’ use of scientiﬁc representations for communication and helping them to integrate their representational knowledge systematically with content knowledge ( Linn et al . , 2006 ; Stieﬀ , 2011 ) . Speciﬁcally , the complementation of simulation - based learning by the aforementioned sketching activities was found to support a deeper understanding of the representation being presented ( Wu and Rau , 2018 ; Kohnle et al . , 2020 ; Ainsworth and Scheiter , 2021 ) . Considering the value of multiple representations for science learning , unsurprisingly , they also play a major role in university physics . For instance , in electrodynamics , vector ﬁeld representations are deeply rooted in the developmental history of the domain ( Faraday , 1852 ) , being represented either algebraically as a formula or graphically using arrows . In university experimental lectures , an introduction to electric and magnetic ﬁelds typically starts from concrete analogous representations of electric or magnetic ﬁeld lines , then moving on to more abstract or idealized visual - graphical and symbolical representations ( Küchemann et al . , 2021 ) . Using demonstration experiments , electric and magnetic ﬁeld lines are visualized , for example , by semolina grains ( Benimoﬀ , 2006 ; Lincoln , 2017 ; Küchemann et al . , 2021 ) or iron ﬁlings ( Thompson , 1878 ; Küchemann et al . , 2021 ) , respectively . When representing a FrontiersinPsychology 02 frontiersin . org Hahn and Klein 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1012787 quantity as a vector ﬁeld , the ﬁelds’ properties , its divergence and curl , and further the integral theorems of Gauss and Stokes are of particular importance for physics applications ( Griﬃths , 2013 ) . Accordingly , a sound understanding of vector calculus is of great importance for undergraduate and graduate physics studies . For example , a study by Burkholder et al . ( 2021 ) found a signiﬁcant correlation between extensive preparation in vector calculus and students’ performance in an introductory course on electromagnetism . However , further research also revealed that a conceptual understanding , which is relevant to physics comprehension , often caused diﬃculties for students ( e . g . , Pepper et al . , 2012 ; Singh and Maries , 2013 ; Bollen et al . , 2015 ) . Besides conceptual gaps regarding vector ﬁeld representations in general , learning diﬃculties in dealing with vector ﬁeld concepts such as divergence and curl became particularly apparent . For example , students struggled to extract information about divergence or curl from vector ﬁeld diagrams and they interpreted and used these concepts literally instead of referring to their physics - mathematical concepts ( Ambrose , 2004 ; Pepper et al . , 2012 ; Singh and Maries , 2013 ; Bollen et al . , 2015 , 2016 , 2018 ; Baily et al . , 2016 ; Klein et al . , 2018 , 2019 ) . In a study on students’ diﬃculties regarding the curl of vector ﬁelds , Jung and Lee ( 2012 ) diagnosed the gap between mathematical and conceptual reasoning as a major source of comprehension problems . Furthermore , Singh and Maries ( 2013 ) concluded that graduate students struggle with the concepts of divergence and curl , even though they know how to calculate them mathematically . In the context of electrostatics and electromagnetism , it was also shown that conceptual gaps regarding vector calculus led to improper understanding and errors in when applying essential principles in physics of essential principles in physics ( Ambrose , 2004 ; Jung and Lee , 2012 ; Bollen et al . , 2015 , 2016 ; Li and Singh , 2017 ) . Regarding these ﬁndings , it is noticeable that the aforementioned studies did not strictly distinct between conceptual understanding and representational competencies with respect to vector ﬁelds . This is not surprising , since there is strong overlap of the two areas in this subject domain— vector ﬁelds are , as such , a form of representation that cannot be understood in a subject context isolated from concepts . Conversely , it is almost impossible to learn electrodynamics concepts without vector ﬁeld representations . In introductory physics texts , vector concepts are typically given as mathematical expressions , but are either not or insuﬃciently explained qualitatively ( Smith , 2014 ) . Even in more advanced physics textbooks , there is little geometric explanation or discussion of vector ﬁeld concepts and integral theorems . Regarding the aforementioned empirical ﬁndings , relevance and requirement of new instructions that address a conceptual understanding become even more apparent . Consequently , numerous authors advocated the use of visual representations in order to foster a conceptual understanding . Following this line of research , Bollen et al . ( 2018 ) developed a guided - inquiry teaching - learning sequence on vector calculus in electrodynamics aiming at strengthening the connection between visual and algebraic representations . Implementing the tutorials in a second - year undergraduate electrodynamics course revealed a positive eﬀect of the interventions on physics students’ conceptual understanding and their ability to visually interpret vector ﬁeld diagrams . In addition , subjects expressed primarily positive feedback regarding the learning approach . However , as discussed by the authors , the exact results should be interpreted with care as the number of participants was small and the implementation followed a less streamlined structure as , for example , no strict control and intervention group design was used . Additionally , Klein et al . ( 2018 , 2019 ) developed text - based instructions for visually interpreting divergence using vector ﬁeld diagrams . Eye tracking was used to analyze representation - speciﬁc visual behaviors , such as evaluating vectors along coordinate directions . Here , gaze analyses revealed a quantitative increase in conceptual understanding as a result of this intervention ( Klein et al . , 2018 , 2019 ) . In addition to a positive impact of visual cues on performance measures , a positive correlation with students’ response conﬁdence was found . This means that students not only answered correctly more often , but also trusted their answers more , which is a desirable result of successful teaching ( Lindsey and Nagel , 2015 ; Klein et al . , 2017 , 2019 ) . In subsequent interviews , subjects expressed diagram - speciﬁc mental operations , such as decomposing vectors and evaluating ﬁeld components along coordinate directions , as a main problem source ( Klein et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , a follow - up experimental study involved sketching activities aiming at generating representation - speciﬁc aids ( e . g . , ﬁeld components ) to support the visual interpretation of divergence ( Hahn and Klein , 2021 , 2022a ) . Here , sketching was shown to signiﬁcantly reduce perceived cognitive load when applying visual problem - solving strategies related to a ﬁelds’ divergence ( Hahn and Klein , 2022a ) . With regard to previous ﬁndings concerning student problems , building upon the existing multi - representational teaching - learning materials , and using the DeFT framework ( Ainsworth , 2006 ) , four multi - representational learning tasks were developed aiming at visually interpreting vector ﬁeld diagrams ( Hahn and Klein , 2022b ) . Their structure follows the Modeling Instruction approach as each task addresses one vector calculus concept in which the representational forms are used in a coordinated manner aiming at developing conceptual understanding ( e . g . , McPadden and Brewe , 2017 ) . Furthermore , sketching activities and a vector ﬁeld simulation are incorporated to provide cognitive relief , to foster engagement with the representations , and to support the development of representational competencies related to vector calculus concepts . Here , representation - speciﬁc sketching activities , such as sketching vector components or highlighting rows or columns to support evaluation along coordinate directions , were included ( Klein et al . , 2018 , 2019 ; Hahn and Klein , 2021 , 2022a ) . Additionally , typical sketching tasks for learning with simulations , such as copying or creating FrontiersinPsychology 03 frontiersin . org Hahn and Klein 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1012787 FIGURE1 Study design with timeline from left ( t 0 ) to right ( t 2 ; intervention group IG , control group CG , multiple representations MRs ) . The designations “IG - CG group” and “CG - IG group” refer to the chronological order of the groups in the rotational design ( ﬁrst intervention group , then control group , or vice versa ) . a vector ﬁeld diagram , were involved ( Kohnle et al . , 2020 ) . As part of the present registered report study , the research - based multi - representational learning tasks are implemented into lecture - based recitations in a ﬁrst - year electrodynamics course . Consequently , the present study aims at evaluating the added value of multiple representations in task - based learning of vector calculus by comparing a multi - representational intervention group and a control group with traditional calculation - based task . Therefore , the following guiding question is investigated : “Do multi - representational learning tasks have a higher learning impact than traditional ( calculation - based ) tasks in the context of vector ﬁelds ? ” Considering previous research ﬁndings and theoretical frameworks from cognitive psychology on multi - representational learning , and on the use of sketching activities and simulations , we hypothesize that multi - representational , sketching - and simulation - based tasks ( H1 ) promote students’ performance as measured by a vector ﬁeld performance test ( that includes tasks related to vector calculus , vector ﬁeld quantities , and vector ﬁeld concepts ) , and ( H2 ) reduce perceived cognitive load ( as measured by a cognitive load questionnaire ) during task processing . 2 . Methods Learning tasks are implemented in the weekly recitations on experimental physics II in the summer semester 2022 and 2023 . Physics students usually attend experimental physics II in their second semester of study , then encountering university electromagnetism for the ﬁrst time . The module includes a lecture with demonstration experiments and weekly recitations in which the compulsory assignments are discussed . Dividing the study into an alpha and a beta implementation ( summer semester 2022 and 2023 , respectively ) primarily serves to consolidate the data . In the alpha implementation , all instruments and learning tasks are tested and psychometrically characterized , thus providing guidance for improvement . Then , alpha as well as beta implementation are used to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the intervention aiming at answering the guiding question and testing the hypotheses . Study design and procedure are identical in both implementations in order to transfer conclusions from the alpha to the beta implementation . 2 . 1 . Procedure The studies are based on within - and between - subjects treatments wrapped in a rotational design ( Figure 1 ) . At the beginning of the lecture period , all recitation groups are randomly divided into two superordinate groups ( IG - CG and CG - IG groups , respectively ) both serving as intervention groups ( IG ) and control groups ( CG ) at some time but in diﬀerent order . Students select a ﬁxed recitation group by their own without knowing about the assignment to a treatment condition later on . Before the ﬁrst intervention phase , students take a performance test on vector calculus ( section 2 . 3 ) . Subsequently , the ﬁrst intervention phase starts and in each of the following four weeks , students complete a mandatory intervention task ( either a multi - representational or a traditional task ) in addition to a set of standard tasks which does not diﬀer between the groups . The latter consists of typical , predominantly calculation - and formula - based , problem - solving tasks that have always been used in the course ( e . g . , they present some vector ﬁelds and students must calculate divergence or curl ) . First , the upper group in Figure 1 is intervention group ( IG ) and works on the multi - representational learning tasks , while the lower group , acting as a waiting group , is control group ( CG ) and works on traditional ( calculation - based ) tasks . All assignments are completed by self - study within one week , submitted for correction , and discussed with a dedicated , independent intervention tutor during the subsequent recitation . Prior to each task discussion , a short questionnaire on perceived cognitive load during task processing and means of task assistance is deployed ( section 2 . 3 ) . After the ﬁrst intervention phase in the seventh week of the semester , students again complete the performance test on vector calculus and another evaluation questionnaire . Subsequently , the groups switch roles and the second four - week intervention phase starts . Finally , the FrontiersinPsychology 04 frontiersin . org Hahn and Klein 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1012787 performance test on vector calculus and the questionnaire are administered again . 2 . 2 . Power analysis Due to the lack of comparable studies regarding target group and topic , power analyses are based on eﬀect sizes of methodologically similar studies . Akkus and Cakiroglu ( 2010 ) reported medium ( η 2 = 0 . 128 , f = 0 . 383 ) to large eﬀect sizes ( η 2 = 0 . 233 , f = 0 . 551 ) when comparing seventh grade students’ algebra performance between an experimental group provided with a multiple representation - based algebra instruction and a control group using a conventional instruction . Power analyses with G ⋆ Power 3 . 1 ( Faul et al . , 2009 ) indicated that for an analysis of covariance ( p < 0 . 05 ) including two covariates ( e . g . , semester of study and school leaving examination grade ) and an average eﬀect size of f = 0 . 467 , a sample size of N = 51 students would be required to obtain a desired power of 0 . 9 ( McDonald , 2014 ) . A meta analysis by Sokolowski ( 2018 ) found a large overall weighted mean eﬀect size of f = 0 . 53 regarding the use of representations in Pre - K through ﬁfth grade mathematics compared to traditional teaching methods which would require a sample size of N = 40 considering the aforementioned assumptions . Regarding the alpha implementation of this study , pre - and midtest were completed by N = 116 and N = 64 students , respectively . For beta implementation , similar sample sizes can be expected which would be consistent with the power analyses results . 2 . 3 . Materials and measures Test and scale analyses reported in the following are based on the assessments and responses of the alpha implementation . Here , data from the ﬁrst implementation phase are used to ensure the largest possible data base . Therefore , the performance test at t 0 ( N = 116 ) and the weekly questionnaire used in the ﬁrst recitation after the pretest ( N = 93 ) were examined . The sample from the pretest included 86 male and 27 female undergraduate physics students with a mean age of 20 . 3 ± 1 . 9 years , a mean school leaving examination grade of 1 . 7 ± 0 . 6 [ “Abitur” grade ; referring to a scale from 1 ( best ) to 6 ] , and in their 2 . 8 ± 1 . 5 semester of study . Prior to test and scale analyses , all datasets were cleaned of outliers . An overview of all variables and scales used in the study is given in Table 1 . Initially , all subjects completed a test with demographic questions ( e . g . , age , gender , semester of study ) and a performance test on vector calculus assessing conceptual understanding closely linked with representational competencies . The performance test included 19 tasks , partly comprising several subtasks , hence , a total of 65 items TABLE 1 Overview of variables , instruments , and scales including scale analyses results of the alpha implementation ( scale mean M , mean difficulty index P , mean standard deviation SD , mean discrimination index D , Cronbach’s alpha α C , Spearman - Brown coefficient ρ ) .

FrontiersinPsychology 05 frontiersin . org Hahn and Klein 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2022 . 1012787 ( multiple - choice and true - false items of one task counted separately ) covering seven diﬀerent subtopics of vector calculus . Forty - nine of the items were designed in multiple - choice or true - false format , while the remaining 16 items required a sketch , formula , justiﬁcation , calculation , or a proof . Most of the items were taken from established concept tests on electrodynamics ( CURrENT ) or have been used and validated in a similar form in previous studies ( Bollen et al . , 2015 , 2018 ; Baily et al . , 2016 , 2017 ; Klein et al . , 2018 , 2019 , 2021 ; Hahn and Klein , 2022a ; Rabe et al . , 2022 ) . Exploratory factor analysis of the performance test did not reveal a distinct factor structure which is a common result for concept tests in STEM education research ( e . g . , FCI ; Heller and Huﬀman , 1995 ; Hestenes and Halloun , 1995 ; Huﬀman and Heller , 1995 ; Scott et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , for the following analyses , the performance test is considered in its entirety . With a mean diﬃculty index of P = 0 . 51 , a mean discrimination index of D = 0 . 34 , and a reliability of α C = 0 . 86 ( Table 1 ) , the performance test shows satisfactory psychometric properties according to the recommendations of Ding and Beichner ( 2009 ) . Additionally , for most of the multiple - choice and true - false items , response conﬁdence was assessed using a 6 - point Likert - type rating scale ( 1 = absolutely conﬁdent to 6 = not conﬁdent at all ; D = 0 . 56 , α C = 0 . 97 ; Table 1 ) to provide insight into student response behavior beyond performance measures . Since previous studies , also in the context of instruction - based learning of vector ﬁeld concepts , found positive correlations between performance and conﬁdence ( e . g . , Lindsey and Nagel , 2015 ; Klein et al . , 2019 ) , it will be investigated whether group membership inﬂuences this correlation . In weekly recitations , students answered a short questionnaire related to the previous learning task providing information about the cognitive load they experienced while completing the task as well as any kind of task assistance . The items regarding cognitive load are based on a scale measuring the three types of cognitive load from Leppink et al . ( 2013 ) which was supplemented by items from Klepsch et al . ( 2017 ) and Krell ( 2017 ) . The ﬁnal questionnaire contained 12 items measuring cognitive load on a 6 - point Likert - type rating scale ( 1 = strongly disagree to 6 = strongly agree ) . As a result of principal component analysis with varimax rotation (cid:2) KMO = 0 . 74 , X 2 ( 66 ) = 522 . 56 , p < 0 . 001 (cid:3) , four subscales can be identiﬁed ( 75 . 03 % variance explanation , excluding item CL10 ; Table 1 ) : extraneous cognitive load ( four items , α C = 0 . 82 ) , intrinsic cognitive load ( three items , α C = 0 . 88 ) , germane cognitive load ( two items , ρ = 0 . 84 ) , and eﬀort ( two items , ρ = 0 . 80 ) . The three scales for extraneous , intrinsic , and germane cognitive load reﬂect the three types of cognitive load according to Sweller ( 2010 ) , with the germane cognitive load scale primarily addressing perceived improvement in understanding . In addition , the eﬀort scale assesses the eﬀort expended in task completion ( Paas and Van Merriënboer , 1994 ; Krell , 2017 ) . Following the recommendations of Ding and Beichner ( 2009 ) , item and scale analyses yielded good values of item - total correlation ( r it ≥ 0 . 56 ) and discrimination indices ( D i ≥ 0 . 50 ) as well as the scales’ mean discrimination indices ( D ≥ 0 . 53 ) and their reliabilities ( α C ≥ 0 . 80 ) . In addition to the perceived cognitive load , means of task assistance ( e . g . , “working together in a group with students from my course” , “looking up in a textbook” ) were assessed using a choice format . After the intervention phases , the students again completed the performance test which was extended by a module - speciﬁc task on electrostatics . In addition , a questionnaire was used which surveyed the tutor’s behavior during task discussion as a control variable using six items ( 6 - point Likert - type rating scale from 1 = strongly disagree to 6 = strongly agree ) . The items are based on the “tutor evaluation questionnaire” by Dolmans et al . ( 1994 ) supplemented by modiﬁcations from Baroﬃo et al . ( 1999 ) and Pinto et al . ( 2001 ) . Following the results of principal component analysis with varimax rotation (cid:2) KMO = 0 . 89 , X 2 ( 15 ) = 293 . 91 , p < 0 . 001 (cid:3) , the scale will be considered in its entirety ( 68 . 61 % variance explanation ) . It shows a high reliability ( α C = 0 . 89 ) and a satisfactory discrimination index ( D = 0 . 33 ; Table 1 ) . Further information and detailed documentation of the study material , instruments , scales , and test analyses can be found in the Supplementary material . 2 . 4 . Statistical data analysis As required for parametric procedures , all scales for dependent and control variables ( Table 1 ) were checked for normal distributed scale expressions . Regarding the hypotheses , statistical analyses will mainly comprise ( co - ) variance analyses to examine the inﬂuence of group membership on the dependent variables . Both intervention phases are methodologically treated equally , but analyzed separately to ensure the largest possible data base . Moreover , the rotational design allows a comparison of the pre - post learning gains of intervention and control group within each phase . Here , a common measure of gain , Hake’s gain , as deﬁned by the quotient of absolute gain and maximum possible gain , is used ( Hake , 1998 ) . However , a comparison of both conditions ( traditional vs . multi - representational ) can also take place within the IG - CG and CG - IG groups , since each group is once CG and once IG . In addition , 2 × 2 analyses of variance will be conducted to examine the impact of the intervention comparing diﬀerent time points ( pre - post comparison ) . Moreover , the performance test will be examined in more detail using Rasch analysis .
