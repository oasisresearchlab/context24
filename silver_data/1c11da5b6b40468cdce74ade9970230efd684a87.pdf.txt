Leukocyte Proﬁles in Wild House Finches with and without Mycoplasmal Conjunctivitis , a Recently Emerged Bacterial Disease Andrew K . Davis , Katherine C . Cook , and Sonia Altizer Department of Environmental Studies , Emory University , 400 Dowman Drive , Atlanta , GA 30322 Abstract : Leukocyte proﬁles ( relative numbers of white blood cell types ) have been used by a growing number of ecological studies to assess immune function and stress in wild birds . House Finches ( Carpodacus mexicanus ) in eastern North America are susceptible to an eye disease caused by the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum , providing the opportunity to examine whether leukocyte proﬁles are associated with infection status and other host characteristics . In this study , we compared blood smears from 297 wild House Finches with and without conjunctivitis to examine whether leukocyte proﬁles were associated with the presence and severity of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis . We also evaluated the inﬂuence of age , sex , and molt on leukocyte proﬁles in both diseased and nondiseased birds . Of 243 House Finches of known age and sex sampled , 30 % showed clinical signs of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis . House Finches with conjunctivitis had signiﬁcantly higher heterophil to lymphocyte ( H / L ) ratios and harbored greater numbers and proportions of heterophils and monocytes than nondiseased birds . Leukocyte proﬁles of noninfected birds did not differ signiﬁcantly with respect to sex , but young birds had signiﬁcantly greater numbers of lymphocytes and total white blood cells than adults . Molting birds had signiﬁcantly more eosinophils than nonmolting birds . Finally , House Finches with the most severe outward signs of conjunctivitis showed the most dramatic leukocyte changes relative to noninfected individ - uals , and increasing H / L ratios and monocytes in diseased birds were paralleled in a subset of birds that were recaptured during the study period . These results are consistent with patterns observed in domestic poultry and suggest that understanding patterns of leukocyte differentials in this host - pathogen system could improve our understanding of innate immunity and infectious disease risk in other wild passerines . Key words : Mycoplasma gallisepticum , Carpodacus mexicanus , white blood cells , innate immunity , heterophils , lymphocytes , monocytes I NTRODUCTION Among birds and other vertebrates , white blood cells ( WBCs ) or leukocytes associated with the innate immune system represent one of the ﬁrst lines of defense against infectious diseases ( Roitt et al . , 2001 ) . Leukocytes such as monocytes , heterophils , and some lymphocytes can there - fore offer an important measure of nonspeciﬁc host im - mune function and health status ( Wakelin , 1996 ; Harmon , 1998 ; Norris and Evans , 2000 ; Roitt et al . , 2001 ) . Circu - lating leukocytes can increase rapidly in number following Published online : October 6 , 2004 Correspondence to : Andrew K . Davis , e - mail : akdavis @ emory . edu EcoHealth 1 , 362 – 373 , 2004 DOI : 10 . 1007 / s10393 - 004 - 0134 - 2 (cid:1) 2004 EcoHealth Journal Consortium infection by bacteria , blood protozoa , and larger macro - parasites , and particular types of leukocytes can target broad pathogen groups ( Roitt et al . , 2001 ) . For example , avian heterophils , like neutrophils in mammals , are the primary line of innate defense for bacterial infections , especially for microbial pathogens in the respiratory tract where few macrophages exist ( Harmon , 1998 ) . Monocytes are long - lived macrophages that have also been shown to be important in responding to infections by bacteria and other pathogens ( Qureshi , 1998 ) . The relative proportion of each type of leukocyte in an animal’s circulating bloodstream is referred to as its leukocyte proﬁle ( also called the leukocyte differential ) , and assessing leukocyte proﬁles can allow for estimates of infection status and provide indices of stress at the time of sampling ( e . g . , Vleck et al . , 2000 ; Ruiz et al . , 2002 ) . Most conclusions concerning the function of avian leukocytes in innate immunity are based on research con - ducted with domestic poultry ( e . g . , Branton et al . , 1997 ; Qureshi , 1998 ; Zulkiﬂi et al . , 1999 ; Campo et al . , 2000 ; Elston et al . , 2000 ) , but a growing number of experimental and descriptive studies have examined leukocytes in wild passerines . Leukocyte proﬁles have been used in recent empirical studies to assess general stress and immuno - competence in wild birds ( e . g . , Svensson and Skarstein , 1997 ; Figuerola et al . , 1999 ; Bortolotti et al . , 2002 ) . Other ecological studies have suggested that the ratio between two avian leukocytes , the heterophil / lymphocyte ( H / L ) ratio , provides an indicator of overall stress levels of individual birds ( e . g . , Gross and Siegel , 1983 ; Vleck et al . , 2000 ; Ruiz et al . , 2002 ) . Finally , leukocyte differentials and H / L ratios have been used in recent studies to demonstrate links be - tween stress and territory quality ( Mazerolle and Hobson , 2002 ) and trade - offs between reproductive effort and im - mune function ( Norris and Evans , 2000 ) . Despite their recent increase in use in avian ecology , predicting directional changes in leukocyte differentials is challenging , because higher proportions of any leukocyte type could reﬂect greater host immunocompetence , or could be caused by a host’s response to current infections . For example , if a bird that appears otherwise healthy har - bors high levels of circulating heterophils or monocytes , this might indicate either strong baseline defenses or the presence of an active infection . Because heterophils are the major component of the widely - used H / L ratio , under - standing processes that underlie variation in heterophil or lymphocyte numbers is crucial to interpreting this measure in studies of wild and captive birds . House Finches in eastern North America are suscep - tible to a recently emerged eye disease caused by the bac - terium Mycoplasma gallisepticum ( MG ) . This novel strain of a domestic poultry disease has caused dramatic reduc - tions in House Finch abundance following its emergence in 1993 – 1994 ( Ley et al . , 1996 ; Dhondt et al . , 1998 ; Ho - chachka and Dhondt , 2000 ) . Infected House Finches usu - ally develop eye infections within 7 – 10 days after exposure , and clinical signs , including swelling and discharge from conjunctival tissues , can persist for many weeks ( Luttrell et al . , 1998 ; Roberts et al . , 2001a ) . The obvious physical manifestations of MG infections , combined with the fact that wild House Finches are easy to observe , capture , and handle , make this a model system for understanding the role of infectious diseases in wild avian systems ( e . g . , Dhondt et al . , 1998 ; Nolan et al . , 1998 ; Hochachka and Dhondt , 2000 ; Hartup et al . , 2001a , b ) . This host - pathogen system also provides a unique opportunity to examine how avian leukocyte differentials are associated with infections in wild birds , and to compare the differentials from wild birds and poultry infected with a similar pathogen . For example , infections with MG in commercial hens have been shown to cause signiﬁcant increases in the proportions of circulating heterophils and monocytes ( Branton et al . , 1997 ) . However , it is not known if the innate immune system of House Finches responds similarly to MG infec - tion . Recent analyses of continent - wide , citizen science data on the prevalence of conjunctivitis in House Finches has documented annual ﬂuctuations in prevalence character - ized by predictable fall – winter epidemics and a consistent summer decline ( Hartup et al . , 2001a ; Altizer et al . , 2004a ) . Seasonal changes in House Finch life history and behavior , including ﬂocking behavior , feeder use , and the recruit - ment of large numbers of juvenile birds may initiate annual outbreaks of this pathogen ( Altizer et al . , 2004b ) . Variation in host immunocompetence as inﬂuenced by molting stress , reproductive effort , or environmental stress could also contribute to annual variation in House Finch sus - ceptibility . Thus , an important question , and the primary goal of this study , is whether House Finch characteristics , including age , sex , or molting status , are associated with innate immune status ( as measured by leukocyte proﬁles ) and the occurrence of MG . We compared leukocyte differentials among House Finches with and without physical signs of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis during two successive fall – winter epidemics in a region where MG prevalence is typically high ( in the Leukocytes and Conjunctivitis in House Finches 363 southeastern US ; Altizer et al . , 2004b ) . We predicted that leukocyte differentials in House Finches would covary with the interactive effects of host age , sex , molt , and infection status . Moreover , based on observations made from poultry infections with MG , we expected that heterophils and monocytes in particular would increase with the severity of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis . Finally , because infection with MG could induce physiological stress in House Finches , we predicted that H / L ratios would be positively correlated with the severity of clinical signs . M ETHODS We trapped House Finches at ﬁve locations within 10 km of the Emory University campus in Atlanta , GA between August 15 , 2001 and January 15 , 2003 using a combination of mist nets and wire mesh cages placed around tube - style bird feeders following Hill ( 2002 ) . Upon capture , all birds were given a unique combination of one numbered alu - minum leg band and three colored leg bands . Trapping methods and ﬁeld protocols were approved by the Emory University Animal Care and Use Committee ( # 189 - 2002 ) , and were conducted under Federal Bird Marking permit # 23141 , and GA Scientiﬁc Collecting Permit # 29 - WMB - 02 - 176 . All birds were aged and sexed according to Pyle ( 1997 ) , and we recorded basic morphological characteris - tics ( e . g . , wing chord , tarsus length , molting status ) of each bird . Adult House Finches undergo one ( prebasic ) molt each year between July and October ( Michener and Michener , 1940 ; Hill , 1993 ) , whereas the prebasic molt of juvenile House Finches is usually incomplete ( Stangel , 1985 ) . Because the annual prebasic molt begins and ends with the replacement of primary ﬂight feathers ( Michener and Michener , 1940 ) , we recorded molting status of each bird ( as yes / no ) based on whether or not any primaries were being replaced at the time of capture . We scored the clinical signs of mycoplasmal conjunc - tivitis in each eye using a four - point scale after Roberts et al . ( 2001a ) as follows : 0 = no signs of conjunctivitis ; 1 = eyes with minor swelling ; 2 = eyes with moderate swelling and discharge ; and 3 = extreme swelling or crusting to the point of near blindness . Past work has shown that clinical sign of conjunctivitis in House Finches closely correspond with the presence of the M . gallisepticum ( Ley et al . , 1996 ; Luttrell et al . , 1996 , 1998 ; Hartup et al . , 2001a ) , so that clinical signs provide a reliable measure of infection status . Furthermore , a subset of birds captured in our study were tested for the presence of the MG bacterium via culture and polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) from eye swabs . Of 87 House Finches that showed no clinical signs of conjunctivitis between August 2001 and September 2002 , 97 . 7 % tested negative for the bacterium [ D . Ley , unpublished data ] . Similarly , over 85 % of a subset of birds observed with clinical signs of conjunctivitis also tested positive for M . gallisepticum ( N = 75 ) . In the present article , we therefore assumed that birds showing clinical signs were indeed infected with MG , and we further assumed that birds not showing clinical signs represented uninfected individuals and hereafter are re - ferred to as such . To collect blood samples , we punctured the brachial vein of each ﬁnch with a 25 - guage needle and collected 15 – 20 l l of blood in a heparinized microhematocrit tube . Blood smears were made using the two - slide wedge tech - nique ( Messonnier , 2000 ; Walberg , 2001 ) , and slides were air - dried , ﬁxed with methanol , and stained with Giemsa . We examined each smear under 1000 · and counted all heterophils , lymphocytes , eosinophils , monocytes , and ba - sophils following Campbell ( 1995 ) . We examined a mini - mum of 100 white blood cells on each slide and calculated the proportions of each WBC type , in addition to H / L ratios . We further estimated total numbers of all leuko - cytes , and of each leukocyte type , per 10 , 000 red blood cells based on the numbers of cells of each type per ﬁeld of view . All blood smears were divided approximately evenly ( with respect to date and infection status ) among two observers for examination . Observers were blind to the infection status during slide examination . Repeatability of Leukocyte Differentials We evaluated the repeatability of our leukocyte differentials in two ways . First , duplicate blood smears from 10 unin - fected birds were examined by a single observer , and we used Pearson’s correlation to evaluate the similarity be - tween WBC differentials for these two sets of smears for each bird . We found that correlation coefﬁcients for all arcsine square - root transformed proportions ( heterophils , lymphocytes , basophils , and eosinophils ) except monocytes exceeded 0 . 74 , and these correlations were signiﬁcant at the 0 . 05 level or higher . For monocytes , proportions recorded for all birds were less than 0 . 05 , but repeated observations within the same bird were not signiﬁcantly positively cor - related . Second , 15 identical blood smears were evaluated by the same two examiners that recorded all WBC differ - entials used in this study . We used Pearson’s correlation 364 Andrew K . Davis et al . and repeated measures analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) to examine the consistency between both examiners in reporting counts for the same set of birds . As in the earlier test , Pearson correlation coefﬁcients based on transformed proportions for all values except monocytes exceeded 0 . 73 and were signiﬁcant at the 0 . 01 level or greater . For monocytes , all reported proportions were less than 0 . 07 , but values were not signiﬁcantly correlated between the two examiners . Repeated measures ANOVAs based on trans - formed proportions of heterophils , lymphocytes , and monocytes showed a signiﬁcant effect of examiner at the 0 . 05 level or greater ( e . g . , for the proportion of heterophils , examiner effect was associated with mean square [ MS ] = 0 . 092 , F = 12 . 98 , P = 0 . 003 ) . The effect of examiner was not signiﬁcant in repeated measures ANOVAs based on the proportions of eosinophils and basophils . Thus , despite the fact that our WBC differentials showed a high degree of similarity between observers for nearly all measures , we could not rule out an effect of examiner , and therefore included this as an independent variable in analyses de - scribed below . Statistical Analysis Because our primary objective was to examine the associa - tion between leukocyte differentials and infection with M . gallisepticum , we used samples from 297 birds captured during two seasonal periods of high prevalence : August 2001 – January 2002 , and August 2002 – January 2003 . Con - sistent with previous reports of highly seasonal epidemics of this bacterial disease ( e . g . , Hartup et al . , 2001a ; Altizer et al . , 2004a ) , over 97 % of blood samples from birds with clinical signs of MG were collected during these two fall – winter periods . The prevalence of House Finches with clinical signs of MG during these intervals ranged from 6 % ( August 2002 ) to 62 % ( October 2001 ) , and prevalence during both years peaked during October ( Altizer et al . , 2004b ) . With the data outlined above , we used ANOVA to examine associations between leukocyte parameters and House Finch age , sex , molt , and MG infection status ( SPSS , 2002 ) . Each of the following leukocyte parameters were treated as separate dependent variables : H / L ratios , and estimated numbers ( per 10 , 000 red blood cells ) of heter - ophils , lymphocytes , basophils , monocytes , eosinophils , and total WBCs . Moreover , we repeated these same anal - yses of each leukocyte type using proportions as well as total counts . All proportions were arcsine square - root transformed , and counts were log - transformed ( e . g . , Log 10 [ Count + 1 ] ) prior to analysis to normalize the error vari - ance . Our initial statistical model included the main effects of each variable of interest , two - way interactions between infection status and age , sex , and molt , the three - way interaction infection status * age * sex , and the main effects of examiner and year . Because no two - or three - way interaction effects were statistically signiﬁcant for any dependent variable tested , we removed these from the ﬁnal analysis to include only main effects as predictor variables . Because of the large number of both dependent and inde - pendent variables , we reported only results for variables with signiﬁcant test results ( e . g . , P < 0 . 05 ) or marginally signiﬁcant trends ( e . g . , P < 0 . 1 ) . In a separate analysis of variance , we examined the associations between infection severity and each dependent leukocyte parameter . We averaged the infection score across both eyes per individual bird , and collapsed these averages into four severity categories : 0 ( not infected ) , 1 ( mean = 0 . 5 ) , 2 ( 1 . 0 £ mean £ 1 . 5 ) , and 3 ( 2 . 0 £ mean £ 3 . 0 ) . Our statistical model was again based on arcsine square - root transformed proportions or log - transformed counts , and included the main effects of severity , year , and examiner ( i . e . , effects of age , sex , and molt were not in - cluded ) . We used Tukey’s test at the 0 . 05 level to compare means and determine homogeneous subsets for levels of infection severity . Finally , for a subset of birds that were captured more than once within each observation period , we examined how leukocyte differentials changed as a function of capture events and infection status . We used data from 37 individual birds that were captured between August 1 – December 1 of 2001 or 2002 and were recaptured between 7 – 60 days later in either the same or a different state of infection with mycoplasmal conjunctivitis . A total of 15 birds were cap - tured twice with no clinical signs ( transition category 0 – 0 ) , 7 birds were captured twice with clinical signs both times ( transition category 1 – 1 ) , and 15 birds were captured ini - tially without clinical signs , but upon recapture showed signs of MG ( transition category 0 – 1 ) . We used repeated measures ANOVA to test the effects of capture event ( ﬁrst vs . second ) and transition category on transformed values of each leukocyte count and proportion and H / L ratios . R ESULTS Of the 243 birds of known age captured during two annual periods of high prevalence , 124 were aged as AHY ( adults ) , Leukocytes and Conjunctivitis in House Finches 365 and 119 were aged as HY ( juveniles ) . Sex was assigned to 284 birds , of which 200 were male and 84 were female . A total of 56 birds were reported as actively molting , and most of these ( 78 . 6 % ) were adults . Almost 30 % of the samples examined ( 89 / 297 ) were from birds with visible signs of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis . Leukocytes in Noninfected , Nonmolting Birds Among nonmolting , noninfected birds of known age ( n = 133 ) , proportions of lymphocytes ranged from 0 . 39 – 0 . 99 ( mean = 0 . 79 ) . The mean proportions of heterophils , eo - sinophils , monocytes , and basophils were much lower ( Table 1 ) . Among individual birds , heterophils accounted for between 0 . 0 – 0 . 32 of all WBCs , and eosinophils and basophils ranged from 0 . 0 – 0 . 40 . Monocytes were the least common WBC type , with proportions ranging from 0 . 0 – 0 . 15 among individual birds ( Table 1 ) . H / L ratios in uninfected , nonmolting House Finches averaged 0 . 08 , with a range from 0 . 0 – 0 . 48 among nondiseased individuals . Our estimates of total WBCs per 10 , 000 red blood cells ranged from 21 to 202 , with a mean of 81 . 6 leukocytes per non - diseased bird . Molt , Age , Sex , and Mycoplasmal Conjunctivitis Analysis of variance using transformed leukocyte counts and proportions showed that heterophils , monocytes , and H / L ratios were signiﬁcantly higher among birds with vis - ible signs of MG ( when measured as a 0 – 1 variable ; Ta - bles 1 and 2 ) . Molting birds had more eosinophils than nonmolting birds ( Table 1 ) , and this association was highly signiﬁcant ( Table 2 ) . WBC differentials appeared similar for both HY and AHY birds ( Table 1 ) , but analysis of variance revealed that HY birds had signiﬁcantly more lymphocytes and total WBCs than AHY birds ( Table 2 ) . Sex was not signiﬁcantly associated with any leukocyte parameter . Finally , main effects of examiner and year were statistically signiﬁcant for a subset of leukocyte parameters ( Table 2 ) . Because results were qualitatively similar when analyses were performed on log - transformed counts of each leukocyte type versus arcsine square - root transformed Table 1 .

Infection Severity and Leukocyte Parameters Of the 89 visibly infected birds sampled during the study period ( including those for which age was unknown ) , 23 had mild conjunctivitis ( score = 1 ) , 45 had moderate outward signs ( score = 2 ) , and 21 had severe outward signs ( score = 3 ) . Analysis of variance showed a signiﬁcant effect of severity on H / L ratios and on the numbers of heter - ophils , monocytes , and total WBCs ( Table 3 ) . Heterophils and monocytes increased in birds with moderate and severe infections ( Fig . 1 ) , as did estimates of total WBCs and H / L ratios . Comparison of means showed that proportions of heterophils and monocytes were indistinguishable for class 0 and class 1 birds , but birds in classes 2 and 3 had sig - niﬁcantly higher proportions of both WBC types ( Fig . 1 ) . Comparison of estimated counts of heterophils and monocytes showed similar differences , with one exception : Monocytes in birds with mild , moderate , or severe infec - tions were sharply and signiﬁcantly higher than nondis - Table 2 .

Dependent variables tested for each model effect were H / L ratios and estimated numbers of heterophils , lymphocytes , eosinophils , monocytes , basophils , and total WBCs per 10 , 000 RBCs . H / L ratios were arcsine square - root transformed prior to analysis , and all other dependent variables were log - transformed . Only results for combinations of independent and dependent variables with one or more marginal or signiﬁcant effects ( P < 0 . 1 ) are shown . The ﬁnal model was run with no two - or three - way interactions because these effects did not approach signiﬁcance for any dependent variable ( as described in Methods ) . Leukocytes and Conjunctivitis in House Finches 367 eased birds but counts among the 1 – 3 severity classes were similar to each other . As before , results were qualitatively similar when analyses were performed on counts of each leukocyte type versus proportions , and only statistical re - sults based on count data are reported in Table 3 . Leukocyte Changes in Recaptured Birds Repeated measures ANOVAs that treated ﬁrst and second capture events as within - subject effects showed that H / L ratios depended on both capture event and transition group , with a nearly signiﬁcant effect of capture event on numbers of heterophils ( Table 4 ) . For monocytes , effects of capture event , transition group , and the transition group * capture event interaction were highly signiﬁcant , so that both proportions and total counts of monocytes were lowest among birds with no clinical signs at each capture event ( 0 – 0 ) , increased following infection for birds that developed conjunctivitis ( 0 – 1 ) , and were highest for birds showing conjunctivitis at both capture events ( Fig . 2a ) . Heterophils and H / L ratios were lowest among uninfected birds , and increased upon second capture for birds in both the 0 – 1 and 1 – 1 transition groups ( Fig . 2b ) . For the proportions of heterophils and H / L ratios , these effects of capture event and transition group were again statistically signiﬁcant , although estimated heterophil counts were signiﬁcantly associated with capture event alone ( Table 4 ) . Proportions of lymphocytes varied sig - niﬁcantly with transition group and were lower among birds in the 1 – 1 category , but no effects were signiﬁcant for estimated lymphocyte counts ( Table 4 ) . Finally , no effects of capture event or transition group were signiﬁ - cant for the counts or proportions of basophils or eo - sinophils ( Table 4 ) . Table 3 .

H / L ratios were arcsine square - root transformed prior to analysis , and all other dependent variables were log - transformed . Only results for combinations of independent and dependent variables with one or more marginal or signiﬁcant effects ( P < 0 . 1 ) are shown . 368 Andrew K . Davis et al . D ISCUSSION Leukocytes and Mycoplasmal Conjunctivitis Consistent with studies of responses of domestic poultry infected with M . gallisepticum ( Branton et al . , 1997 ) , the proportions of heterophils and monocytes in wild House Finches showed the most extreme changes as a function of visible signs of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis . Relative levels of heterophils and monocytes were clearly higher among House Finches with clinical signs of MG , and both leuko - cyte types increased with infection severity ( Fig . 1 ) , as did total WBC counts . Moreover , leukocyte comparisons among recaptured birds showed that both heterophils and monocytes increased upon second capture for birds that developed clinical signs , and for birds that showed con - junctivitis at both ﬁrst and second capture ( Fig . 2 ) . Col - lectively , these results suggest that heterophils and monocytes play an important role in mitigating infection by this recently emerged bacterial disease in wild House Finches . Interestingly , comparison of heterophil and monocyte proportions among House Finches with different levels of infection severity showed that proportions were similar for birds with both mild and no clinical signs relative to birds with moderate and severe conjunctivitis ( Fig . 1 ) . This could be caused by a lag time in the response of leukocyte differentials to infection with MG , or could be due to the possibility that some birds with mild clinical signs were in the recovery stage of infection . For example , Kollias et al . ( 2004 ) showed that the severity of physical signs of con - junctivitis among captive House Finches peaked at 2 – 3 weeks following exposure to MG , and gradually declined over the subsequent 4 – 8 weeks to undetectable levels . Iso - lation of the bacterium from eye and choanal swabs fol - lowed a similar time course , and in some cases clinical signs persisted for 2 or more weeks beyond the point of bacterial shedding . However , it is important to note that estimated counts of monocytes showed a slightly different pattern relative to the proportions shown in Figure 1 , with monocyte counts increasing in birds with mild infections and remaining similarly high across all three severity classes . Ratios of heterophils to lymphocytes are commonly used to measure chronic stress levels in birds ( e . g . , Gross and Siegel , 1983 ; Elston et al . , 2000 ; Horak et al . , 2002 ; Ruiz et al . , 2002 ) . Not unexpectedly , we found higher H / L ratios in House Finches infected with MG , and these ratios increased among birds with greater levels of disease severity . A recent study of an overlapping set of birds ( Altizer et al . , 2004b ) showed that diseased House Finches were also in poorer condition than nondiseased birds , as measured by a com - posite index of pectoral muscle condition , subcutaneous fat , and residuals of body mass regressed against tarsus length . Thus , greater stress among House Finches with severe visible signs of MG could be linked with loss of body mass and reduced fat loads resulting from infection . Indeed , compar - ison of this same composite measure of body condition and leukocyte differentials among infected birds in this study showed a negative relationship between body condition and proportions of heterophils , monocytes , and H / L ratios ( ) 0 . 19 < Pearson’s R < ) 0 . 17 ) , although these correlations were not signiﬁcant at the 0 . 05 level ( 0 . 08 < P < 0 . 12 ) . Effects of Molt , Age , and Sex Molting has been shown to be a stressful and energetically costly event in the life cycle of passerines , especially during the end of their breeding phase ( Hemborg and Lundberg , 1998 ) . However , it remains unclear whether molting is costly in terms of innate immunity , and if molting birds show signiﬁcant white blood cell changes . To our knowl - edge , only one study to date has examined associations between white blood cell numbers and molt in passerines ( Nava et al . , 2001 ) , and showed that captive House Spar - rows ( Passer domesticus ) had higher numbers of basophils Figure 1 .

Severity categories are explained in the Methods section . Sample sizes for each group were as follows : 0 = 208 , 1 = 29 , 2 = 45 , 3 = 21 . Error bars represent standard errors .

Leukocytes and Conjunctivitis in House Finches 369 and monocytes after their molt had ended ( relative to prior to molting ) . In our study , we found that nondiseased , ac - tively molting , adult House Finches had sharply elevated eosinophils ( but not basophils or monocytes ; Table 1 ) relative to nonmolting birds . Possible explanations for an association between eosinophil production and molt in wild House Finches could relate to the timing of exposure to other parasites ( e . g . , in mammals , eosinophils are in - volved in attacking macroparasites and release agents that reduce inﬂammation at the site of invasion ; Roitt et al . , 2001 ) . We also found that molting adult House Finches with conjunctivitis had lower proportions of eosinophils and basophils than noninfected , molting birds ( Table 1 ) . One possible explanation might be that MG impedes or interferes with eosinophil production during the molting process . In support of an interaction between molting and Figure 2 .

Transition categories are as follows : 0 – 0 = bird captured twice with no clinical signs ( n = 15 ) , 0 – 1 = birds initially captured with no clinical signs but later recaptured with conjunctivitis ( n = 15 ) , and 1 – 1 = birds with conjunctivitis upon both capture events ( n = 7 ) . Gray bars indicate ﬁrst capture events , and black bars indicate second capture . Error bars represent standard errors for each group . Table 4 .

H / L ratios were arcsine square - root transformed prior to analysis , and all other dependent variables were log - transformed .

Davis et al . mycoplasmal conjunctivitis , Brawner et al . ( 2000 ) found that captive male House Finches that were infected with MG while completing their prebasic molt did not develop their normal plumage coloration . Counter to our predictions , we found few signiﬁcant main effects or interactions involving age and sex on leuko - cyte parameters of wild House Finches , with the exception that HY birds had signiﬁcantly higher counts of lymphocytes and total WBCs relativeto adult birds ( Tables 1 and 2 ) . These results overall suggest that the innate immune systems of adult and juvenile ﬁnches were similar both in their normally circulating levels of most leukocytes and in their response to a bacterial infection . Recent studies have suggested that juve - nile House Finches were more likely to contract mycoplasmal conjunctivitis than adults ( Roberts et al . , 2001b ; Altizer et al . , 2004b ) , but our study suggests that that differential suscep - tibility between juveniles and adults is probably not related to differences in the proportions of any type of circulating white blood cell . Moreover , the response to infection was similar across all categories of age and sex , indicating that relative increases in heterophils and monocytes occurred across multiple classes of infected birds . Leukocyte Parameters in Noninfected Birds One striking pattern to emerge from the House Finch leu - kocyte parameters we observed was that the differentials of uninfected , nonmolting House Finches deviated substan - tially from previously published values for other passerine species , especially with respect to the proportions of heter - ophils and H / L ratios ( assembled for comparison in Ta - ble 5 ) . That we found a lower proportion of circulating heterophils in uninfected House Finches relative to other passerine species is of particular interest , as heterophils are known to actively counter bacterial infections in birds ( Harmon , 1998 ) . If it is indeed true that House Finches have lower proportions or numbers of circulating heterophils , further comparisons of leukocyte differentials among House Finches and other songbird species would be warranted , as one factor underlying the extreme susceptibility of House Finches to M . gallisepticum could relate to these low baseline levels of circulating heterophils . However , the possibility exists that the low proportion of heterophils we observed in House Finches was an artifact of the smear preparation method we used . For example , Fudge ( 1994 ) pointed out that the two - slide - wedge technique we employed can result in artiﬁcially low numbers of granulocytic leukocytes in pet birds ( which often have baseline levels of heterophils above 50 % ) . To address this possibility , we captured and examined blood smears from three other common passerine species at our study sites for comparison ( Table 5 ) . We examined blood smears from 5 – 10 individuals of each species , using the same methods for smear preparation and leukocyte counting as with House Finches , and examinations were performed by one of the observers who performed the House Finch counts . Average heterophil proportions in these other species were consistent with values reported from the majority of other passerine species and were approximately twice as high as heterophil proportions ob - served in wild House Finches ( Table 5 ) .

Leukocytes and Conjunctivitis in House Finches 371 Leukocytes in Ecological Research Ornithologists and ecologists have increasingly studied relationships between host immunity , stress , and ecology , contributing to a growing ﬁeld of ‘‘ecological immunology’’ ( Svensson and Skarstein , 1997 ) . Recent studies have dem - onstrated that leukocyte differentials offer reliable and meaningful measures of avian stress and condition ( e . g . , Vleck et al . , 2000 ; Horak et al . , 2002 ) . Cross - species com - parisons of leukocyte counts in mammals and birds have been used to ask whether features of host behavior or ecology are associated with risk of parasite infection and host im - mune defenses ( e . g . , Møller et al . , 1998 ; Nunn et al . , 2000 ; Nunn , 2002 ) . A critical task that remains is to determine which leukocyte parameters in wild birds are linked with greater baseline immune defenses , and which cell types play signiﬁcant roles in responding to infectious diseases . This is difﬁcult in part due to a lack of information on the function of speciﬁc leukocytes in birds , and to differences in the re - sponses to stress or infection among different bird species . Our results concerning the effects of infection on leu - kocyte differentials in wild House Finches might be useful for interpreting leukocyte differentials in other bird species . For example , we found a close correspondence between H / L ratios and heterophil proportions , suggesting that variation in H / L ratios reﬂected underlying changes in the numbers and proportions of heterophils . In other words , we found that higher H / L ratios in wild House Finches were driven primarily by elevated heterophils as opposed to reduced numbers of lymphocytes ( Table 1 ) , and that H / L ratios did not provide additional information beyond patterns derived from the proportion of heterophils . In addition , further studies that follow the fates of large numbers of marked House Finches for which blood parameters are known might identify blood characteristics associated with future susceptibility to infection . Such comparisons would provide information regarding the role of speciﬁc leukocytes in protecting hosts against bacterial disease , which would in turn provide a more deﬁnitive assessment of immune de - fenses relative to leukocyte differentials .
