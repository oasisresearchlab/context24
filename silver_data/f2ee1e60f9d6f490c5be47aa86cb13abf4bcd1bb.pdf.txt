Recent studies have 23 shown that actin filaments that form in the nucleus are associated with diverse functions . 24 Here , using live imaging of an F - actin - specific probe , superfolder GFP - tagged utrophin 25 ( UtrCH - sfGFP ) , we demonstrated the dynamics of nuclear actin in zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) 26 embryos . In early zebrafish embryos up to around the high stage , UtrCH - sfGFP 27 increasingly accumulated in nuclei during the interphase and reached a peak during the 28 prophase . After nuclear envelope breakdown ( NEBD ) , patches of UtrCH - sfGFP 29 remained in the vicinity of condensing chromosomes during the prometaphase to 30 metaphase . When zygotic transcription was inhibited by injecting α - amanitin , the nuclear 31 accumulation of UtrCH - sfGFP was still observed at the sphere and dome stages , 32 suggesting that zygotic transcription may induce a decrease in nuclear F - actin . The 33 accumulation of F - actin in nuclei may contribute to proper mitotic progression of large 34 cells with rapid cell cycles in zebrafish early embryos , by assisting in NEBD , 35 chromosome congression , and / or spindle assembly . 36 3 Introduction 37 Actin is a highly conserved protein throughout eukaryotes . In the cytoplasm , actin 38 serves a role in cell migration , stress fiber formation , and cell division by forming a 39 contractile ring during cytokinesis . Actin is also present in nuclei , where it plays a crucial 40 role in transcriptional regulation ( Vartiainen et al . , 2007 ; Baarlink et al . , 2013 ; Tian et al . , 41 2016 ; Sokolova et al . , 2018 ) and in DNA damage repair processes ( Chiolo et al . , 2011 ; 42 Belin et al . , 2015 ; Caridi et al . , 2019 ) . Actin nuclear localization is mediated through the 43 interplay of nuclear import regulated by importin 9 with cofilin ( Dopie et al . , 2012 ) and 44 nuclear export regulated by exportin 6 ( Exp6 ) , which transports profilin - actin complexes 45 ( Stüven et al . , 2003 ) . Whereas filamentous actin ( F - actin ) is rarely observed in somatic 46 cell nuclei , it is presumed to be involved in regulating the function and structure of 47 undifferentiated cell nuclei ( Misu et al . , 2017 ) . 48 In mouse early embryonic nuclei , F - actin facilitates nuclear expansion during the G1 49 phase ( Baarlink et al . , 2017 ) and maintains the integrity of the totipotent state of the cell 50 mass ( Okuno et al . , 2020 ) . Nuclear actin polymerization via Wave - 1 is required for 51 reprogramming somatic nuclei that are transplanted into African clawed frog ( Xenopus 52 laevis ) oocytes ( Miyamoto et al . , 2011 ) . Actin has a distinct role in the large nucleus of 53 oocytes , which is also called the germinal vesicle ( GV ) . Xenopus laevis GV contains a 54 high concentration of actin to maintain the large nuclear structure ( Clark and Merriam , 55 1977 ; Clark and Rosenbaum , 1979 ; Bohnsack et al . , 2006 ) . In mammalian oocytes , F - 56 actin bundle in GVs stabilizes the chromatin mobility and secures the accurate 57 chromosome alignment and segregation ( Mogessie and Schuh , 2017 ; Scheffler et al . , 58 2022 ; Dunkley et al . , 2022 ) . In starfish oocytes , actin mesh forms in the nuclear area 59 after nuclear envelope break down ( NEBD ; Lénárt et al . , 2005 ) , and the contraction of 60 4 the actin meshwork transports chromosomes until they are captured by microtubules 61 ( Mori et al . , 2011 ) . In addition , F - actin polymerizes underneath the nuclear envelope and 62 accelerates fragmentation of the nuclear envelope during the first stage of NEBD ( Mori 63 et al . , 2014 ; Wesolowska et al . , 2020 ) . 64 During Xenopus embryonic development , F - actin accumulates in nuclei up to the 65 blastula stage , when the major wave of zygotic transcription begins , before diminishing 66 at the gastrula stage ( Oda et al . , 2017 ) . A reconstituted system utilizing Xenopus egg 67 extracts has been used for analyzing the assembly of early embryonic nuclei from de - 68 membraned sperm in vitro ( Murray , 1991 ) . In reconstituted nuclei using this system , 69 nuclear actin prevents chromatin aggregation during interphase and facilitates 70 chromosome alignment during prometaphase ( Oda et al . , 2017 ) . However , the dynamics 71 of nuclear actin during Xenopus embryo development have not been elucidated , 72 because live - cell imaging is hampered by the melanin granules that are present in the 73 cortex of embryos . 74 In contrast to the African clawed frog ( Xenopus laevis ) , zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) embryos 75 that share a similar developmental process with frog are transparent and thus suitable 76 for live - cell imaging . During the early embryo stages of zebrafish , cells have relatively 77 large nuclei and undergo a series of short and synchronized cell cycles without 78 transcription and gap phases ( Satoh , 1977 ; Kimmel et al . , 1995 ; Joseph et al . , 2017 ) , 79 which also occurs in Xenopus embryos ( Jevtić and Levy , 2015 ; Newport and Kirs chner , 80 1982 ; Lucas et al . , 2000 ; Mahbubani et al . , 1992 ) . 81 In zebrafish embryos , transcription from the zygotic gene is observed as early as at the 82 64 - cell stage , and becomes further activated at around the 512 - cell to 1k - cell stages 83 ( Mathavan et al . , 2005 ; Heyn et al . , 2014 ; White et al . , 2017 ; Pálfy et al . , 2017 ; 84 5 Vastenhouw et al . , 2019 ) . After the 1k - cell stage , the cell cycle elongates and loses 85 synchronicity , which occurs with the onset of differentiation ( Kane et al . , 1992 ) . 86 Fluorescently labeled phalloidin has been the standard reagent to stain F - actin in fixed 87 cells ( Dancker et al . , 1975 ; Wehland et al . , 1977 ) . Live - cell actin - specific probes have 88 also been developed , including fluorescent protein - tagged LifeAct and UtrCH , as well as 89 actin - specific chromobody ( Actin - chromobody® , Rocchetti et al . , 2014 ) . UtrCH , which is 90 the Calponin Homology domain of human utrophin ( Burkel et al . , 2007 ) , is an actin - 91 binding peptide that is more selective to F - actin than LifeAct , which is derived from the 92 yeast actin - binding protein , Abp140 ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ) . In this report , we mainly used 93 superfolder GFP - tagged UtrCH ( UtrCH - sfGFP ) to track nuclear F - actin dynamics in 94 zebrafish early embryos . We observed that F - actin accumulates in nuclei during 95 interphase and the actin patches remained in the vicinity of condensing chromosomes 96 during the prophase to metaphase . 97 6 Results 98 Visualizing nuclear F - actin in zebrafish early embryos 99 To investigate whether F - actin accumulates in nuclei in zebrafish early embryos , we 100 first aimed to detect F - actin by using fixed embryos stained with fluorescently labeled 101 phalloidin . DNA was counterstained with Hoechst dye . Phalloidin signals were enriched 102 in nuclei in the 32 - , 128 - , and 1k - cell stages , particularly in Hoechst - poor regions ( Fig . 103 1A - C ) . In the sphere stage embryos , the total nuclear phallodin signals were decreased 104 whereas filamentous structures were observed ( Fig . 1B and 1C ) . This observation 105 suggests that F - actin is abundantly present in nucleoplasm during the early stages of 106 zebrafish development , as was observed in Xenopus laevis embryos ( Oda et al . , 2017 ) . 107 Although the filamentous structures observed at the later stages are of interest , we here 108 focused on the dynamics and function of nuclear F - actin that are abundantly 109 accumulated at the earlier stages . 110 To visualize nuclear F - actin dynamics in living zebrafish embryos , purified UtrCH - sfGFP 111 ( Fig . S1A ) was injected into the yolk of 1 - cell stage embryos . The antigen - binding 112 fragment ( Fab ) specific for acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 ( H3K9ac ) , which distributes 113 throughout the chromatin from the early stage of development , labeled with Cy5 was co - 114 injected as a chromatin marker ( Sato et al . , 2019 ) . The injected embryos were set onto 115 a confocal microscope at the 4 - cell stage , and three - dimensional time - lapse images were 116 acquired every 90 s from the 8 - cell stage to the oblong stage . UtrCH - sfGFP signal is 117 enriched in the interphase nuclei of embryos from the 8 - cell stage to the 1k - cell stage 118 ( Fig . 1D , arrowheads and insets ; Fig . 2A ; Movie 1 ) . At the oblong stage ( 3 . 5 hours post - 119 fertilization ; hpf ) , UtrCH signals in nuclei became weaker compared to those in earlier 120 stages ( Figs . 1D ) . These live - cell imaging data are consistent with the observations in 121 7 fixed embryos . 122 Time - laps imaging with 1 . 5 - min intervals ( Fig . 2A and Fig . S2 ) and measurements of 123 the nucleus to the cytoplasm intensity ratio ( N / C ratio ) of UtrCH - sfGFP ( Fig . 2B ) revealed 124 that UtrCH - sfGFP signal began to accumulate in the nucleus at the end of telophase , 125 and became more concentrated during interphase , peaking just before mitosis , and then 126 disappeared from mitotic chromosome areas during 16 - cell to 1k - cell stages . After the 127 1k - cell stage , the mean value of UtrCH - sfGFP N / C ratio reduced to less than 1 . 0 ( Fig . 128 2B ) . 129 Because UtrCH could stabilize actin filaments and influence actin dynamics ( Spracklen 130 et al . , 2014 ) , we used another actin - binding peptide , LifeAct , which binds to globular actin 131 ( G - actin ) and F - actin ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ) , as the sfGFP - tagged version ( LifeAct - sfGFP ) 132 to validate the results obtained with UtrCH ( Fig . 2 ) . Purified LifeAct - sfGFP ( Fig . S1B ) 133 was co - injected with Cy3 - labeled anti - phosphorylated histone H3 serine 28 ( H3S28ph ) 134 Fab to highlight chromosomes from the prometaphase to anaphase ( Hayashi - Takanaka 135 et al . , 2014 ) and Cy5 - labeled anti - H3K9ac Fab to label nuclei ( Fig . S1C ) . LifeAct - sfGFP 136 was concentrated in nuclei , showing > 1 . 0 N / C ratio , during early embryonic stages ( Fig . 137 3 ) . After the 1k - cell stage , the LifeAct - sfGFP N / C ratio reduced to < 1 . 0 ( Fig . 3B ) , as was 138 observed in UtrCH - sfGFP ( Fig . 2B ) . This lowered N / C ratio on average could be 139 attributed to the less nuclear accumulation and / or the asynchronized cell cycle , as cells 140 in the mitotic phase showed a low N / C ratio ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) . 141 We then analyzed N / C ratios in individual interphase nuclei by eliminating H3S28ph - 142 positive mitotic cells ( Fig . 3C ) . The cumulative bar chart showed that > 90 % of interphase 143 nuclei exhibited a LifeAct - sfGFP N / C ratio > 1 . 0 up to the 256 - cell stage . At the 512 - and 144 1k - cell stages , the fraction of nuclei with an N / C ratio of > 1 . 0 decreased to ~ 80 % and 145 8 ~ 65 % , respectively ( Fig . 3C ) . After the 1k - cell stage , the fraction of nuclei with an N / C 146 ratio of < 1 increased substantially ( Fig . 3C , 150 min ) , reaching ~ 90 % at the sphere ( 180 147 min ) and dome ( 195 min ) stages . Taken together with the phalloidin - staining and UtrCH - 148 sfGFP data , these results suggest that actin is gradually concentrated and polymerized 149 in nuclei during the interphase in the early stages of zebrafish embryos , as observed in 150 Xenopus ( Oda et al . , 2017 ) , and the amount of nuclear actin decreases after the 1k - cell 151 stage . 152 153 F - actin accumulates in the nucleus during interphase to prophase and remains 154 along with condensing chromosomes during early prometaphase 155 Since nuclear UtrCH - sfGFP reached a peak just before mitosis ( Fig . 2A , 7 . 5 , 9 . 0 , and 156 10 . 5 min ; Fig . S2A , 7 . 5 , 9 . 0 , and 10 . 5 min , 3A , 10 . 5 min ) , we investigated F - actin 157 dynamics during the late interphase to mitosis in detail . For this purpose , 158 tetramethylrhodamine - labeled 155 - kDa dextran ( TMR - dextran ) was used for monitoring 159 the timing of NEBD ; TMR - dextran that was injected into the cytoplasm cannot enter to 160 the nucleus due to its big size until the nuclear membrane breaks down at the onset of 161 prometaphase . Thus , NEBD was identified by the onset of TMR - dextran leakage into the 162 nucleus . In addition , we used JF646 - labeled latency - associated nuclear antigen peptide 163 ( JF646 - LANA ) to track chromatin throughout the cell cycle . The LANA peptide binds to 164 the acidic patch in the nucleosome ( Barbera et al . , 2006 ) , and a synthetic LANA peptide 165 with polyethylene glycol and fluorescein was shown to label chromatin in living cells 166 ( Fujiwara et al . , 2021 ) . In the current study , JF646 - LANA was synthesized ( see Materials 167 and methods ) to be used together with sfGFP - and TMR / Cy3 - labeled probes . Mitotic 168 chromosomes visualized with Cy3 - H3S28ph Fab were indeed more intensely detected 169 9 by JF646 - LANA than by H3K9ac Fab , whose chromatin binding is decreased by 170 deacetylation during mitosis ( Fig . S1C and S1D ) . 171 To visualize F - actin dynamics at around NEBD , 1 - cell stage embryos were injected with 172 UtrCH - sfGFP , TMR - dextran , and JF646 - LANA , and were imaged every 12 . 5 s from 256 - 173 cell stage . Figure 4 shows the representative images of cells in the 1k - cell stage ( A ) and 174 high stage ( B ) embryos with the changes in N / C intensity ratio of UtrCH - sfGFP and TMR - 175 dextran ( C ) . UtrCH - sfGFP accumulated in nuclei ( Fig . 4 , − 37 . 5 s to − 12 . 5 s ) , reaching a 176 peak concomitantly with NEBD as indicated by TMR - dextran diffusing into nuclear areas 177 ( Fig . 4 , 0 s ) . After NEBD , UtrCH signals were remained in the vicinity of condensing 178 chromosomes during prometaphase ( Fig . 4 , 0 s to 25 s ) , and almost disappeared from 179 the chromosome areas by metaphase ( Fig . 4 , 37 . 5 s ) . 180 To track microtubule dynamics with F - actin and chromosomes during prophase to 181 metaphase , TMR - labeled tubulin was co - injected with UtrCH - sfGFP and JF646 - LANA , 182 and three - dimensional images were acquired every 15 s at the 256 - cell ( Movie 2 ) , 512 - 183 cell ( Movie 3 ) , 1k - cell ( Fig . 5 and Movie 4 ) , high ( Fig . 6 and Movie 5 ) , sphere ( Fig . 7 ) , 184 and dome stages ( Fig . S3 ) . UtrCH - sfGFP was located in the nucleus with enrichment at 185 around the nuclear periphery of the 1k - cell stage embryo before NEBD ( Fig . 5 , − 15 s ) . 186 Just after NEBD , UtrCH - sfGFP remained in the vicinity of the condensing chromosomes , 187 and microtubule spindles ( TMR - Tubulin ) grown from centrosomes extended along with 188 the chromosomes ( Fig . 5A , 0 s and 15 s ; see also Fig . 5B for 3D rendering views ) . UtrCH - 189 sfGFP signals gradually disappeared from the nuclear areas during prometaphase to 190 metaphase ( Fig . 5A , 30 – 45 s ; and Fig . 5B , 30 s ) . Concomitantly with actin diminishment , 191 microtubule spindles appeared to capture chromosomes for their segregation ( Fig . 5 , 45 192 s to 90 s ) . Similar dynamics of actin and tubulin were observed from the 256 - cell stage 193 10 to 1k - cell stages ( 256 - cell stage : Movie 2 , 512 cell - stage : Movie 3 ) . In the oblong stage , 194 the UtrCH - sfGFP signal in the nucleus was much weaker ( Fig . 6 , − 45s to 0 s ) ; however , 195 after the NEBD , the actin patches were still observed in the vicinity of condensing 196 chromosomes ( Fig . 6 , 15 s and 30 s ) . In the sphere stage , the timing of UtrCH - sfGFP 197 nuclear accumulation was more transient and the signals were much weaker than those 198 during the 1k - cell stage ( Fig . 7 , 0 s and 15 s ) . Only a trace amount of UtrCH - sfGFP was 199 observed in the chromosome area in the dome stage Fig . S3 , 30 s and 45 s ) . 200 201 Transcription inhibition prolonged nuclear actin decrease after zygotic genome 202 activation ( ZGA ) 203 We next examined the relationship between zygotic transcription and nuclear F - actin , 204 because the amount of F - actin was substantially decreased after the oblong stage , as in 205 most somatic cells ( Schoenenberger et al . , 2005 ; Hofmann et al . , 2009 ; Xu et al . , 2010 ; 206 Parisis et al . , 2017 ) . To test whether zygotic transcription is required to diminish nuclear 207 F - actin , we injected α - amanitin , which directly binds to RNA polymerase II and interferes 208 with its translocation and nucleotide incorporation ( Nguyen et al . , 1996 ; Brueckner and 209 Cramer , 2008 ) , into zebrafish embryos ( Fig . 8A ; Kane et al . , 1996 ; Sato et al . , 2019 ) . 210 Embryos that were injected with α - amanitin or the buffer were fixed at the 1k - cell and 211 oblong stages and stained with Hoechst and phalloidin . In 1k - cell stage embryos , in 212 which major ZGA typically begins , phalloidin signals were concentrated in the nuclei , 213 regardless of α - amanitin injection ( Fig . 8B , 1k - cell ) . In contrast , at the oblong stage , 214 nuclear phalloidin signals were slightly enriched in α - amanitin - injected embryos 215 compared to those detected in the control embryos ( Fig . 8B , oblong ) . We then confirmed 216 the effect of α - amanitin on nuclear F - actin in living cells by using UtrCH - sfGFP . In the 217 11 both amanitin - treated and control embryos , the N / C ratio of UtrCH - sfGFP began to 218 decrease after the high stage ( Fig . 8C ) . However , compared to the control , the N / C ratio 219 in α - amanitin - injected embryos remained relatively high at sphere and dome stages ( Fig . 220 8C ) . These data suggest that the decrease of the N / C ratio of UtrCH - sfGFP is facilitated 221 by zygotic transcription . 222 223 Attempts to disturb nuclear actin in zebrafish early embryos . 224 To investigate the physiological role of nuclear F - actin in early embryos , we sought to 225 artificially manipulate its levels . The first attempt to decrease nuclear actin by ectopic 226 expression of Exp6 , which is known to export actin from the nucleus to the cytoplasm 227 ( Stüven et al . , 2003 ) , by injecting mRNA encoding 3×FLAG - tagged zebrafish Exp6 into 228 embryos . However , Exp6 - 3×FLAG expression induced severe cytokinesis defects but 229 did not decrease nuclear actin levels ( Fig . S4 ) . 230 Next , we expressed a polymerization - deficient actin mutant ( R62D ) , in which Arg 62 231 was substituted to Asp ( Posern et al . , 2002 ) , tagged with the superfolder Cherry and a 232 nuclear localizing signal ( Actin R62D - sfCherry - NLS ) , to inhibit nuclear F - actin formation . 233 The wild type actin tagged with sfCherry - NLS ( Actin WT - sfCherry - NLS ) and sfCherry - 234 NLS were used as controls to examine the effect of the wild - type actin and sfCherry 235 alone . Embryos were co - injected with mRNA encoding Actin R62D - sfCherry - NLS , Actin 236 WT - sfCherry - NLS , or sfCherry - NLS , with UtrCH - sfGFP and Cy5 - labeled H3K9ac - 237 specific Fab and were imaged from 8 - cell stage . The N / C intensity ratios of UtrCH - sfGFP , 238 however , did not show obvious differences among embryos expressing sfCherry - NLS , 239 Actin R62D - sfCherry - NLS , and Actin WT - sfCherry - NLS ( Fig . S5A and S5B ) . Expression 240 of Actin R62D tagged with smaller 3xFLAG tagged versions , instead of sfCherry , also did 241 12 not affect the N / C ratios of UtrCH - sfGFP ( Fig . S5C ) . Because actin was already 242 abundantly present in nuclei , additional expression of the wild - type or mutant actin might 243 have minimal effects . 244 In has been reported that cofilin proteins actively depolymerize actin filaments in 245 cytoplasm during the interphase ( Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ; Amano et al . , 2002 ; Kaji et al . , 246 2008 ; Chin et al . , 2016 ; Wioland et al . , 2017 ) . Cofilin1 is the non - muscle isoform 247 expressed ubiquitously while cofilin2 is the muscle isoform . We expressed zebrafish 248 cofilin1 and cofilin2 , tagged with sfCherry and an NLS , to attempt depolymerizing nuclear 249 actin in embryos , but again the N / C intensity ratios of UtrCH - sfGFP were not affected 250 ( Fig . S6 ) . Thus , it was not possible to manipulate the level of nuclear F - actin in our 251 experimental conditions . Nuclear F - actin level might be robustly regulated in zebrafish 252 early embryos . 253 254 Discussion 255 Nuclear actin accumulation in zebrafish early embryos 256 We demonstrated F - actin accumulation in zebrafish early embryo nuclei by fixed cells 257 using phalloidin and by living cells using fluorescent actin - binding probes . In living 258 embryos from the 8 - cell to 1k - cell stages , UtrCH - sfGFP , which selectively binds to F - 259 actin , gradually accumulated in the nucleus during the interphase , thereby reaching the 260 maximum amount at around NEBD . After the high stage , UtrCH - sfGFP was not much 261 concentrated in nuclei , while some filamentous structures were more evidently observed . 262 These data are consistent with previous findings in mouse and Xenopus laevis early 263 embryos ( Baarlink et al . , 2017 ; Oda et al . , 2017 ) , which indicates that nuclear F - actin 264 accumulation in undifferentiated cells is common in vertebrates ( Xu et al . , 2010 ; 265 13 Miyamoto et al . , 2011 ; Miyamoto et al . , 2013 ; Sokolova et al . , 2018 ; Okuno et al . , 2020 ) . 266 After ZGA , the level of nuclear F - actin drops . The decrease appears to be induced by 267 zygotic transcription , as nuclear F - actin was still observed in the sphere - stage embryos 268 that were treated with α - amanitin , an RNA polymerase II inhibitor . Maternal - to - zygotic 269 transition may alter the balance of nuclear import and export factors of actin , as it was 270 previously demonstrated that the actin exporter , Exp6 , is not expressed in Xenopus 271 oocytes nor in early embryonic stages , yet it becomes expressed after ZGA ( Bohnsack 272 et al . , 2006 ) . 273 274 Nuclear F - actin may facilitate chromosome congression and regulate microtubule 275 growth 276 In early - stage zebrafish embryos , the peak of nuclear F - actin accumulation was 277 concurrent with the timing of NEBD and F - actin localized in the vicinity of condensing 278 chromosomes during prometaphase before disappearing during metaphase . This actin 279 behavior is similar to that observed in starfish oocytes ( Lénárt et al . , 2005 ; Mori et al . , 280 2011 ; Mori et al . , 2014 ; Wesolowska et al . , 2020 ) . In starfish oocyte GV , F - actin is 281 assembled underneath the nuclear membrane and forms spikes toward to the nuclear 282 membranes , which contribute to membrane rupture and NEBD ( Mori et al . , 2014 ; 283 Wesolowska et al . , 2020 ) . After the germinal vesicle breakdown , actin meshwork catches 284 chromosomes and shrinks like a fishnet to transport them over a long distance toward 285 underneath the starfish oocyte cortex in meiosis II ( Lénárt et al . , 2005 ; Mori et al . , 2011 ) . 286 In the mouse oocyte , both nuclear F - actin and spindle F - actin protect the chromosomes 287 misalignment and missegregation at the meiosis ( Mogessie and Schuh , 2017 ; Scheffler 288 et al . , 2022 ) . It is interesting to speculate that the function of actin in large oocyte cells 289 14 may partially be retained in fertilized eggs , although it is unknown whether a similar 290 system to starfish is conserved in zebrafish oocytes . During the short cell cycle of 291 zebrafish embryos , the spindle checkpoint is weak until the zygotic genome activation 292 ( Ikegami et al . , 1997 ) . In relatively large cells during the early embryonic stages , actin 293 patches remained around chromosomes may assist in chromosome congression , just as 294 the actin meshwork in starfish oocytes . It is also possible that actin patches guide 295 microtubule assembly and promote proper and rapid spindle formation , as recent reports 296 have shown that actin supports proper spindle formation in Xenopus gastrula embryos , 297 mouse and human oocytes , and cultured cells ( Woolner et al . , 2008 ; Mogessie and 298 Schuh , 2017 ; Roeles and Tsiavaliaris , 2019 ; Plessner et al . , 2019 ; Farina et al . , 2016 ; 299 Farina et al . , 2019 ; Kita et al . , 2019 ) . However , “spindle - actin” has been depicted with 300 barrel structures composed of fine actin fiber at metaphase , unlike actin patches during 301 the prometaphase of zebrafish embryos . We speculate that the accumulation of F - actin 302 in nuclei in zebrafish early embryos contribute to proper mitotic progression by assisting 303 in NEBD , chromosome congression , and / or spindle assembly under rapid cell cycles 304 with weak checkpoint mechanism . 305 306 Manipulation of nuclear actin level in zebrafish embryos 307 We took different approaches to decrease the level of nuclear F - actin by expressing 308 Exp6 , an NLS - tagged Actin R62D , and NLS - tagged cofilin ; unfortunately , however , none 309 of them were successful . Exp 6 and NLS - tagged Actin R62D have been used to decrease 310 nuclear actin and inhibition of nuclear actin polymerization , respectively , in previous 311 reports ( Bohnsack et al . , 2006 ; Okuno et al . , 2020 ; Miyamoto et al . , 2011 ; Spencer et al . , 312 2011 ; Dopie et al . , 2012 ; Parisis et al . , 2017 ; Baarlink et al . , 2017 ) . However , we did not 313 15 observe significant decreases of UtrCH - sfGFP N / C ratios in zebrafish embryos 314 expressing Exp6 and Actin R62D , under the conditions that did not affect cytoplasmic F - 315 actin . Increasing the expression levels of those proteins by injecting more mRNA affected 316 cytoplasmic F - actin causing defects in cytokinesis . We also attempted to decrease 317 nuclear F - actin using NLS - tagged cofilin 1 and cofilin 2 , which are actin - depolymerizing 318 factors ( Amano et al . , 2002 ; Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ; Kaji et al . , 2008 ; Chin et al . , 2016 ; 319 Wioland et al . , 2017 ) ; however , their expression did not affect nuclear F - actin levels . In 320 addition , the expression of NLS - tagged wild - type actin did not increase UtrCH - sfGFP 321 N / C ratio . It can be speculated that nuclear actin is very abundant and the ectopic wild - 322 type actin or R62D mutant may not affect much on the total F - actin level . Also , F - actin 323 formation in the nucleus may be robustly regulated , and expressing factors that assist in 324 actin depolymerization may be compensated when the expression level is mild not 325 affecting the cytoplasmic actin . 326 327 Materials and methods 328 Zebrafish embryo preparation for live imaging 329 To obtain fertilized eggs , 5 – 10 pairs of AB line WT zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) males and 330 females were crossed .

Zebrafish embryos were fixed at the 32 - , 128 - , 605 1k - cell , and sphere stage , and stained with Acti - stain™ 555 phalloidin and Hoechst . Low 606 ( A ) and high ( B ) power views of single confocal sections are shown . ( C ) Relative intensity 607 profile plots of lines indicated in ( B ) . The intensity is normalized using the average 608 cytoplasmic intensity . Phalloidin signals were clearly observed in nuclei of the 32 - , 128 - , 609 and 1k - cell stages . ( D ) F - actin in living zebrafish embryos . Zebrafish embryos were 610 injected with UtrCH - sfGFP as an F - actin probe and Cy5 - labeled Fab for H3K9ac as a 611 chromatin marker . Every 90 s , 25 z - stack fluorescence images with 4 μ m intervals were 612 acquired using a confocal microscope . Single z - sections are displayed . Accumulation of 613 UtrCH - sfGFP in nuclei is clearly observed in the 8 - to the 1k - cell stage embryos 614 ( arrowheads ) . Insets show the zoomed images of nuclei indicated by red arrowheads . 615 See also Movie 1 . Scale bars : 50 μ m ( A ) , 10 μ m ( B ) , and 100 μ m ( D ) . 616 617 Figure 2 . Nuclear F - actin levels increased in the late interphase . 618 Zebrafish embryos were injected with UtrCH - sfGFP and H3K9ac Fab - Cy5 , and images 619 were acquired using the same procedure as described in Figure 1D . ( A ) Single confocal 620 sections of a nucleus in different cell stages are depicted with the time ( min ) after the 621 onset of the interphase . Scale bar : 20 μ m . ( B ) The nucleus to cytoplasmic ( N / C ) intensity 622 ratios of UtrCH - sfGFP were measured . The mean values of UtrCH - sfGFP N / C ratios with 623 the standard deviations ( s . d . ) and the number of nuclei , as identified by H3K9ac Fab - 624 Cy5 , are plotted . The duration of interphase is shaded in orange from the 8 - to 1k - cell 625 stage . N / C ratios of UtrCH - sfGFP are above 1 . 0 ( orange line ) up to the 1k - cell stage . 626 40 627 Figure 3 .

( A ) Single sections of UtrCH - sfGFP , TMR - 660 tubulin , and JF646 - LANA at the 1k - cell stage embryo , and their merged and magnified 661 images are shown . Relative intensity profile plots of lines are indicated at the bottom . 662 The intensity is normalized using maximum and minimum intensity . UtrCH - sfGFP signals 663 are located by chromosomes . ( B ) The surface rendering three - dimensional images are 664 shown ( green : UtrCH - sfGFP , magenta : JF646 - LANA , cyan : TMR - Tubulin ) . UtrCH - sfGFP 665 accumulated in the nucleus ( − 15 s ) remained in the vicinity of condensing chromosomes 666 after NEBD ( from 0 s to 45 s ) and disappeared before the chromosomes were aligned at 667 the metaphase ( 60 s ) . Just after NEBD ( 0 s and 15 s ) , TMR - Tubulin does not appear to 668 reach chromosomes when UtrCH - sfGFP patches are around . When UtrCH - sfGFP 669 patches partially disappear ( 15 s and 30 s ) , TMR - Tubulin appears to capture condensing 670 chromosomes ( 15 s and 30 s ) . See also Movie 4 . Scale bars : 20 μ m .

Scale 697 bars : 20 μ m . 698 43 699 Figure 8 . Transcription inhibition delayed the nuclear actin decrease after the 1k - 700 cell stage . 701 ( A ) Zebrafish embryos were injected with α - amanitin to inhibit RNA - polymerase II - 702 mediated transcription , or the vehicle ( PBS ) , with Cy3 - labeled morpholino antisense 703 oligonucleotide for miR - 430 transcripts as a transcription marker , and JF646 - LANA as a 704 chromatin marker . Every 90 s , 25 z - stack images with 4 μ m intervals were acquired using 705 a confocal microscope . 7 slices at each time point from the 128 - cell to dome stage were 706 depicted and the max intensity projection images are shown . ( B ) Embryos were grown 707 to the 1k - cell stage and oblong stage before fixation and staining with Hoechst and Acti - 708 stain™ 555 phalloidin . Single confocal sections are shown with N / C ratios of phalloidin 709 intensity ( N = 10 ) . In the box plots , center lines show the medians ; box limits indicate the 710 25th and 75th percentiles ; whiskers extend 1 . 5 times the interquartile range from the 711 25th to 75th percentiles ; × indicates the means ; and data points are plotted as closed 712 circles ( PBS , blue ; α - amanitin , orange ) . p - values obtained with a Students t - test 713 ( unpaired , two - tailed ) are also shown ( * , p < 0 . 05 ) . At the 1k - cell stage , clear phalloidin 714 signals are observed in the nuclei of both embryos treated without or with α - amanitin . At 715 the oblong stage , phalloidin signals are not concentrated in the nucleus of embryos 716 without α - amanitin but are still observed in the nucleus of α - amanitin - treated embryos . 717 ( C ) Zebrafish embryos were injected with α - amanitin , or PBS , and then with UtrCH - 718 sfGFP and H3K9ac Fab - Cy5 . Every 90 s , 25 z - stack fluorescence images with 4 μ m 719 intervals were acquired . The mean values of N / C ratios ( control : blue , + α - amanitin : 720 orange ) are plotted with the s . d . from the 128 - cell to dome stage . α - amanitin - injected 721 embryos showed the higher N / C ratio of UtrCH - sfGFP value in later stages ( sphere and 722 44 dome ) . Single confocal sections at the sphere stage are shown on the right . UtrCH - 723 sfGFP remained accumulated in some nuclei during the sphere stage ( orange 724 arrowheads ) .
