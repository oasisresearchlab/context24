The extent to which schools contribute to the overall propagation of SARS - CoV - 2 was continuing to evolve internationally . Aims To examine regional data on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in primary , post - primary and special schools in Cork and Kerry , two counties in southwest Ireland , during the first 6 weeks of the 2020 – 2021 academic year and determine the rate of in - school transmission . Methods Data were obtained from the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting ( CIDR ) system and supplemented with digital records from the regional Department of Public Health ( Dept PH ) and from the Health Service Executive ( HSE ) Covid Care Tracker application . The positivity rate among school close contacts was calculated to determine the rate of in - school SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Results The overall rate of in - school transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 was low at 4 . 1 % . Positivity rates among students and staff who were close contacts were similarly low ( 3 . 1 % vs . 6 . 9 % , p = 0 . 07 ) . One secondary case of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) emerged , on average , for every 7 . 6 infectious days spent by an index case in school . Schools accounted for 2 . 2 % of all notified cases of COVID - 19 in the region during the observation period . Conclusions During the first 6 weeks of the academic year , the rate of in - school SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the region was low , and schools did not contribute substantially to the overall burden of COVID - 19 . Keywords COVID - 19 · Outbreaks · SARS - CoV - 2 · Schools Introduction On March 12 , 2020 all primary , post - primary and special schools in Ireland were closed as part of a broad national strategy to contain the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) [ 1 ] . In July 2020 , the Department of Education , informed by public health advice and engage - ment with educational stakeholders , devised a roadmap for the reopening of schools in Ireland [ 2 ] , and schools across the country subsequently reopened in late August 2020 . Following their reopening , many infection prevention and control ( IPC ) measures to prevent and limit the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 in school settings were implemented . These included the use of facial coverings for staff and students aged 13 years and older where 2 m physical distance could not be maintained , the maintenance of at least 1 m distance between students in classrooms ( except for students in the first 4 years of primary school ) , adherence to hand hygiene and the imple - mentation of enhanced cleaning regimes , among many other measures [ 3 , 4 ] . Efforts have been made by the Department of Education to ensure that schools can remain safely open through the issuing of guidance documents and the provision of monetary and non - monetary supports [ 2 ] . * Philippa White philippa . white2 @ hse . ie 1 Department of Public Health , HSE South , St Finbarr’s Hospital , Douglas , Cork , Ireland / Published online : 1 April 2021 Irish Journal of Medical Science ( 1971 - ) ( 2022 ) 191 : 547 – 552 1 3 The eight regional Departments of Public Health ( Depts PH ) in Ireland play a key role in preventing and limiting the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 in schools by rapidly identifying cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) and their close con - tacts in schools , ensuring close contacts are tested for COVID - 19 and advising on isolation and restricted movement periods , as necessary , for the required time periods . Furthermore , the regional Depts PH advise individual schools on actions to mitigate the risk of transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in a par - ticular school setting where applicable [ 5 ] . Cork and Kerry , hereafter referred to as HSE ( Health Ser - vice Executive ) South , have a combined population of over 690 , 000 [ 6 ] , representing approximately 14 % of the total population of the Republic of Ireland [ 7 ] . A total of 134 , 515 pupils are enrolled in schools in HSE South , with 79 , 564 students in 430 primary schools , 53 , 788 students in 82 post - primary schools , and 1163 students in 18 special schools [ 8 – 10 ] . Special schools are schools which provide education for children with special educational needs . The Dept PH HSE South is notified of all regional cases of COVID - 19 . The aim of this study was to examine the rate of in - school transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in primary , post - primary , and special schools in HSE South during the first 6 weeks of the 2020 – 2021 academic year and to determine the extent to which schools contributed to the overall burden of COVID - 19 in the region during this period . Methods Onward transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in primary , post - primary and special schools in HSE South during the first 6 weeks of the academic year ( 27 August – 11 October 2020 ) was investigated . As the date of school reopening after sum - mer holidays in Ireland is not standardised [ 11 ] , this time period included an extra week for some schools . An index case was defined as the first individual to be identified with COVID - 19 in a school or class grouping , with the first positive COVID - 19 polymerase chain reac - tion ( PCR ) test result or the earliest symptom onset , and an infection source outside the school . For the purpose of this study , only index cases that were notified to the Dept PH during the observation period , attended school during his or her infectious period , and had close contacts in school identified by contact tracing were included . Index cases that had no close contacts in school identified by contact tracing were excluded . Relevant epidemiological data were collated on every student and staff index case of COVID - 19 who met these eligibility criteria . A case’s infectious period was defined as ( a ) the period starting 48 hours prior to symptom onset and ending 10 days after symptom onset for sympto - matic cases or ( b ) starting 24 hours prior to a positive test and ending 10 days after the positive test for asymptomatic cases [ 12 ] . Data on the index case’s age , role ( e . g . student or teacher ) , school attendance during his or her infectious period , symp - toms and names of school close contacts were all collected . A close contact was defined as an individual who was within 1 m of a case of COVID - 19 while wearing a mask , or within 2 m if unmasked , in an indoor or outdoor setting for a cumu - lative total of 15 min or more over a 24 - hour period during the case’s infectious period . The results of all identified school close contacts’ COVID - 19 PCR tests , taken within the 14 - day period after the last exposure to the index case , were examined to determine the rate of in - school transmission . Where a school close contact tested positive , the COVID - 19 PCR test results of their school , household and social close contacts in turn were examined to assess whether fur - ther transmission had occurred . This process was repeated to assess the extent to which further transmission had sub - sequently occurred in school and beyond the school setting , and to determine the extent to which schools contributed to the overall burden of COVID - 19 in the region during this time period . An in - depth epidemiological investigation into every school case which emerged was conducted and where there was evidence that a staff or student close contact was more likely to be infected outside of school than in school ( e . g . if a family member had already tested positive ) , they were not reported to have been infected in school . Data on student and staff index cases were obtained from the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting ( CIDR ) sys - tem , the primary information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland [ 13 ] . They were supplemented with more detailed informa - tion from the Dept PH’s digital records of cases of COVID - 19 in schools and from information retrieved from the HSE Covid Care Tracker application , a national online system in which information about every confirmed case of COVID - 19 in Ireland is recorded . Fisher’s exact test was performed to compare COVID - 19 positivity rates of students and staff close contacts . All sta - tistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 15 [ 14 ] . Results Overall , there were 1614 confirmed cases of COVID - 19 notified in HSE South during the observation period , 199 ( 12 . 33 % ) of whom were children of school - going age ( i . e . 4 – 18 years ) and 1141 ( 70 . 7 % ) of whom were adults of work - ing age ( i . e . 19 – 65 years ) . Over that time , 62 index cases of COVID - 19 ( students and staff ) were identified as having attended schools in the region during their infectious period and had close contacts in school identified by contact trac - ing . Of these 62 index cases , 80 . 6 % ( n = 50 ) were students and 19 . 4 % ( n = 12 ) were staff ( Table 1 ) . 548 Irish Journal of Medical Science ( 1971 - ) ( 2022 ) 191 : 547 – 552 1 3 Of the 56 index cases that had symptoms , the symptoms experienced were cough ( 57 . 1 % ) , rhinorrhoea ( 55 . 3 % ) , fatigue ( 44 . 6 % ) , sore throat ( 44 . 6 % ) , fever ( 37 . 5 % ) , headache ( 37 . 5 % ) , anosmia or ageusia ( 23 . 2 % ) , myalgia or arthralgia ( 23 . 2 % ) , dyspnoea ( 16 . 1 % ) , diarrhoea ( 8 . 9 % ) and nausea or vomiting ( 3 . 6 % ) . A total of 485 school close contacts were identified by contact tracing , 73 . 2 % ( n = 355 ) of whom were students and 26 . 8 % ( n = 130 ) of whom were staff ( Table 2 ) . Of these 485 school close contacts , 20 tested positive for COVID - 19 , indicating an overall in - school transmission rate of 4 . 1 % . The positivity rate among student close contacts was 3 . 1 % , while the positivity rate among staff close contacts was 6 . 9 % ( p = 0 . 07 ) . These 20 cases arose from a total of 152 infectious school days , amounting to , on average , one case per 7 . 6 infectious school days .

Excluding this atypical event gave an overall in - school transmission rate of 2 . 5 % , as opposed to 4 . 1 % . Furthermore , excluding this atypical event , the positivity rate among student close contacts was 2 . 2 % , and the positivity rate among staff close contacts was 3 . 8 % ( p = 0 . 6 ) . Of the 20 close contacts who tested positive for COVID - 19 , 55 % ( n = 11 ) were infected in a single special school , 35 % ( n = 7 ) were infected in four separate primary schools and 10 % ( n = 2 ) were infected in two post - primary schools . Of these 20 cases , 11 ( 55 % ) were symptomatic and 9 ( 45 % ) were asymptomatic . Seven ( 77 . 8 % ) of the 9 staff infected in school were symptomatic ; only 4 ( 36 . 3 % ) of the 11 students infected in school were symptomatic . Of the 1614 cases of COVID - 19 in HSE South during the observation period , only 20 ( 1 . 2 % ) were directly infected in schools ( Table 3 ) . The 20 cases of COVID - 19 caused by in - school transmission during the observation period , however , led to 16 further transmission events in total outside of the school setting . Therefore , schools both directly and indirectly accounted for 36 of 1614 ( 2 . 2 % ) of all notified cases of COVID - 19 in HSE South during the first 6 weeks of the academic year . Of the 199 cases of COVID - 19 in school - going age chil - dren ( i . e . 4 – 18 years ) in HSE South during the observation period , schools accounted for 15 ( 7 . 5 % ) cases ( Fig . 1 ) . Of the 1141 cases of COVID - 19 in adults aged 19 – 65 years in HSE South during the observation period , schools accounted for 21 ( 1 . 8 % ) cases ( Fig . 2 ) . Discussion This study investigated in - school transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in primary , post - primary and special schools in HSE South during the first 6 weeks of the 2020 – 2021 academic year . Overall , it was found that the rate of in - school trans - mission of SARS - CoV - 2 was low and that in - school trans - mission of SARS - CoV - 2 did not contribute substantially to the burden of COVID - 19 in the region during this time . The role schools play in the overall transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 is not yet fully understood [ 15 ] . The find - ings of this study demonstrate that the vast majority of close contacts identified in schools had ‘not detected’ test results for COVID - 19 . This is consistent with findings of Table 3 The burden of COVID - 19 due to in - school transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in HSE South , Ireland , 27 August – 11 October 2020 Source : CIDR , digital records of Dept PH HSE South and HSE Covid Care Tracker application * Infected outside of the school setting by a case infected in school Role Total cases School was direct infection source School was indirect infection source * Total infec - tions due to schools Total ( all ages ) 1 , 614 ( 100 % ) 20 ( 1 . 2 % ) 16 ( 1 . 0 % ) 36 ( 2 . 2 % ) Children ( 4 – 18 years ) 199 ( 100 % ) 11 ( 5 . 5 % ) 4 ( 2 . 0 % ) 15 ( 7 . 5 % ) Adults ( 19 – 65 years ) 1 , 141 ( 100 % ) 9 ( 0 . 8 % ) 12 ( 1 . 1 % ) 21 ( 1 . 8 % ) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 N u m b e r o f S A R S - C o V - 2 i n f e c (cid:3) o n s Week of no(cid:3)ﬁca(cid:3)on in 2020 Infected in se ng external to school Infected in school se ng Source : CIDR ; digital records of Dept PH ; HSE Covid Care Tracker Applica(cid:3)on .

The find - ing that index cases spent on average 7 . 6 infectious days each in school before a further case emerged is somewhat surprising . It is noted , however , that a study of transmis - sion of SARS - CoV - 2 in schools and childcare facilities in Baden - Wurttemberg , Germany , which implemented similar IPC measures to those in Irish schools , estimated that one secondary case arose in schools and childcare facilities for every 25 infectious days spent by index cases in school [ 20 ] . By examining the COVID - 19 test results of social and household contacts of cases infected at school and subse - quently examining the tests results of their close contacts , and so on , the extent to which schools contributed to the overall burden of COVID - 19 in HSE South over the obser - vation period was determined with a high degree of confi - dence . Ultimately , schools were found to account for a very small proportion of the overall notified cases of COVID - 19 in HSE South during this period . This finding is consistent with studies which have estimated that the reopening , or indeed closures , of schools has little effect on the incidence of COVID - 19 [ 21 , 22 ] . The first 6 weeks of the 2020 – 2021 academic year coin - cided with a period of low community transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in HSE South , with the 14 - day incidence of COVID - 19 remaining below 80 cases per 100 , 000 popula - tion for a significant part of the observation period [ 23 ] . This low level of community transmission allowed the transmis - sion dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 in schools to be more clearly investigated . It could be asserted with a high degree of con - fidence that close contacts of a case in school , with no other apparent infection source , were infected in school , rather than in the community . While in - depth epidemiological investiga - tions were carried out for all cases and helped to determine the direction of transmission in school and outside the school setting , unrecognised community transmission , however , can - not be fully ruled out in all cases . Whole - genome sequencing of epidemiologically linked school cases would have assisted with ruling this out , but was not performed . The limitations of this study , however , must be acknowl - edged . Firstly , as the risk of school outbreaks of COVID - 19 is associated with the incidence of COVID - 19 in the wider community [ 24 ] , our findings may not be generalizable to periods of high community transmission . Secondly , the study did not examine the association between risk of in - school transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 and school type or certain school characteristics . Notwithstanding its limitations , this study’s findings con - tribute to the emerging evidence base regarding the extent to which SARS - CoV - 2 is transmitted in schools . Further investigation into transmission dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 in schools , including during periods of high community trans - mission and in relation to special school settings , is needed .
