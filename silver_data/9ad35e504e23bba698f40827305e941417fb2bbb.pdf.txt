80 From Surplus and Scarcity toward Abundance : Understanding the Use of ICT in Food Resource Sharing Practices PHILIP ENGELBUTZEDER , DAVE RANDELL , MARVIN LANDWEHR , KONSTANTIN AAL , GUNNAR STEVENS , and VOLKER WULF , University of Siegen , Information Systems and New Media Food practices have become an important context for questions around sustainability . Within HCI , sustainable HCI and human - food - interaction have developed as a response . We argue , nevertheless , that food practices as a social activity remain relatively under - examined , and further that sustainable food practices hinge on communal activity . We present the results of action - oriented research with a grassroots movement committed to sustainable food practices at a local , communal level , thereby demonstrating the role of ICT in making food resource sharing a viable practice . We suggest that the current focus on food sharing might usefully be supplemented by attention to food resource sharing , an approach that aligns with a paradigm shift from surplus to abundance . We argue for a design that aims to encourage food resource sharing at a local level but that also has wider ramifications . These “glocal” endeavors recognize the complexity of prosumption practices and foster aspirations for “deep change” in food systems .

It connects people through their social need for solidarity [ 102 ] and sharing food serves as the “bedrock of human civilization” [ 23 ] , linked to fundamental aspects of sociality , including emotional affect , care , and empathy , and social solidarity [ 51 , 52 ] . Grimes and Harper [ 40 ] , for instance , demonstrated the celebratory aspects of food sharing . Simi - larly , Comber et al . [ 20 ] have drawn attention to the situated aspects of food sharing in the home . Nevertheless , the literature on food sharing to prevent food waste mainly deals with the redistri - bution of surplus for consumption [ 66 ] , either as “charitable ” activity [ 25 ] or a form of “gift giving” Author’s address : P .

Arguably , less attention has been paid to “innovative” forms of food sharing in relation to the possibility of what we will call “food resource sharing” ( see Table 1 ) . In what follows , we describe a small - scale local initiative , which aims to encourage local pro - duction , arguing that there are lessons to be learned from such studies . They provide a needed conceptual focus on alternative approaches to both consumption and production and offer a po - tential route to systemic change . Our objective is to refocus attention away from notions of scarcity toward a cooperative view of both consumption and production practices . Thus , our research aims were threefold : ( 1 ) To describe alternative , cooperative , local food production activities . ( 2 ) To reconceptualize HFI in relation to both consumption and production . ( 3 ) To examine the role of ICT . Our work responds to the demand for a “deep change” in food systems in terms of “values , consumption , and production practices , as well as politics allowing for deliberation and grassroots mobilization” [ 112 ] . As part of this “deep change” ( a blanket term for transformation / transition ) , “grass - roots organizations promote and engage consumers and small - scale producers in adopting non - conventional practices of producing and consuming food” [ 112 ] . Grassroots movements open up spaces for participation , using bottom - up and decentralized approaches [ 37 , 99 ] . In this article , we aim to examine how Human - Computer - Interaction ( HCI ) can best deal with challenges to the global food supply chain . Such challenges have been brought into sharp relief through disruptions due to COVID , the recent disruption to grain supplies resulting from the war in Ukraine , and the effects of global warming on crop failure . They are , as Moore [ 69 , 70 ] puts it , an aspect of the “capitalocene” . Fostering local food production brings with it several benefits , not least in terms of community development and ecological and economic sustainability . Moreover , the growing of such local initiatives may become scalable with the support of new technology . Below , we investigate local food resource sharing practices as part of a small , action - oriented research project within a local grassroots movement ( Foodroots Community ) , which is connected to a larger grassroots movement called “Foodsharing” [ 34 ] . In the context of the local community the “chili - sharing project” ( Chili Project ) emerged , in which a number of chili plants were given to adoptive parents . Participants were invited to join a Telegram group in order to support the growth of a community of interest [ 29 ] . Our contribution does not provide specific implications for design , but rather proposes a novel space regarding “abundance” . We describe this as an approach to food resource sharing . We should stress here that we are not arguing against redistributive efforts ( indeed , other elements of our ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . From Surplus and Scarcity toward Abundance 80 : 3 project work engage in redistributive activities ) 1 but argue for increased focus on community building . This brings the benefits others have remarked on [ 9 , 25 ] and is more marked if food redistribution is linked to other sustainable food practices , particularly productive practices such as community cooking or gardening . The article recounts , then , a broadly evaluative study of local food resource sharing , the implications of this sharing , and the tension between the focus on redistributional surplus and that of local production . In keeping with the principles of the sharing economy , we advocate for a non - rivalrous approach toward abundance . Our understanding of food resource sharing involves a complex engagement with prosumption ( see , e . g . , [ 82 ] ) in sustainable food practices at a local and communal level . In relation to the urgent need for a “deep change” in food systems [ 112 ] , we discuss how ICT might support the scaling up of small localized to “glocal” efforts . Although grassroots movements can lead to sustainable practices [ 99 , 112 ] , if they are to do so at a scalable level , we need to understand their various practices , the related challenges , and the different roles that ICT might play [ 78 , 103 , 106 ] . 2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK There are pressing and powerful reasons to see food redistribution as only one part of the chal - lenges associated with global food supply chains . Food systems currently account for 21 % – 37 % of total greenhouse gas emissions [ 65 ] . For this reason , the 2021 Glasgow Declaration at COP26 “brings together all types and sizes of local authorities” to declare their “commitment ( . . . ) to tackle the climate emergency through integrated food policies and a call on national governments to act” . 2 Both consumption and production within a nexus of global capitalist production have been sub - ject to critical scrutiny for some time . Schumacher [ 96 ] , an economist famously responsible for an economics “as if people mattered” , argued that “production from local resources for local needs is the most rational way of economic life” , thereby promoting an idea of technology that was appro - priate to the scale of the community . In a similar vein , Illich [ 49 ] proposed “tools for conviviality” , in order to “give people tools that guarantee their right to [ . . . ] independent efficiency” [ 49 ] . More recently and in specific relation to food production , it has been pointed out that food shortages and food insecurity are largely a consequence of capitalist wealth production [ 3 , 63 , 76 ] . 2 . 1 Human - Food - Interaction Within HCI , the field of Human - Food - Interaction ( HFI ) has engaged with these issues histori - cally on the basis of support for problematic individual experience ( see [ 4 ] for a review ) . We found that food sharing practice research within HFI mainly engages with the avoidance of food waste through redistribution . Notable examples include a longitudinal assessment of ICT tools developed to recover and redistribute food surplus [ 18 ] and design implications as they relate to food systems and food waste [ 33 ] . A growing body of literature argues for the importance of understanding practices , routines , and habits in order to support change , e . g . , [ 19 , 59 , 100 ] . In line with this , the relevance of sociality is becoming more recognized . Dombrowski et al . [ 25 ] , for instance , point out that food sharing , in order to be effective , requires provision and needs to be matched in some way . An important element of their work is that they draw attention to the complex factors that govern food resources and their allocation . They also note the work of “gleaners” in relation to food production . Prost et al . [ 86 ] detail the collaborative work undertaken in “planning , prototyping and launching a food 1 These include a twice - weekly redistribution of food rescued through Foodsharing which takes place next to a newly established community garden , regular cooking , and meeting nights ( supplied with rescued food ) , or a free store where all items are offered free of charge . 2 https : / / w w w . glasgowdeclaration . org / _ files / ugd / fef8dc _ 673ef074e0dc49769cad57f538c6333c . pdf .

[ 8 – 10 ] demonstrate the social factors that govern alternative food distribution policy in a Copenhagen grassroots initiative , drawing on the metaphor of ‘gifting’ to examine the meanings that volunteers attach to their work and the practical methods they adopt to support community goals and values . Norton et al . [ 75 ] conclude from their five - year ethnographic study with two grassroots sustainable agriculture communities that “ [ d ] eveloping information systems based on the values and practices of sustainability communities [ . . . ] has the potential to trans - form the information system landscape to one that can support the design and development of sustainable agriculture , if not to one that is broadly sustainable and equitable” . 2 . 2 Sustainable HCI : Consumption and Production In the wider literature [ 17 , 27 , 94 ] as well as in related contributions to HFI and Sustainable HCI ( SHCI ) , the redistribution of surplus food has become a topic of some interest [ 9 , 18 , 34 ] . Surplus food redistribution in the context of food sharing generally means that edible food is collected be - fore being thrown away and then passed on to individuals , organizations , or communities [ 113 ] . In investigating ICT - mediated food sharing initiatives in 468 urban areas and 91 countries , Davies and Legg stated that “much of the established food sharing , such as emergency food relief , fo - cuses on the redistribution of food products to those in need” [ 23 ] , which Michelini et al . frame as “sharing for charity” [ 66 ] . After more than a decade of SHCI research , the community is still conflicted with regard to definitions of sustainability and thus also with regard to how HCI can address it [ 54 , 55 , 101 ] . The importance of the interplay between economic , ecological , and social levels is now acknowledged among sustainability scholars [ 87 ] . This was recognized in the “three pillars” of sustainability in the 2002 United Nations Declaration on Sustainable Development [ 109 ] . Hirsch et al . reflect that the convergence of these factors has been overlooked due to “an emphasis on ( predominantly urban and middle - to - upper - class ) consumer behavior” [ 47 ] . A focus on persuasive design [ 31 ] that aims at small changes in consumer behavior and small corrections to the way people can achieve their ambitions has also been dominant . Persuasive design in regards to sustainability has been reviewed critically [ 15 , 53 ] , especially with regard to long - term effects , e . g . , [ 97 , 98 ] . In this context , research has progressively focused on the synergetic interrelations between pro - duction and consumption and has therefore investigated “prosumers” , who act in both productive and consumptive capacities [ 89 ] . In recent years , there has been an increase in research aimed at understanding and supporting prosumers , for instance , in the context of energy [ 39 , 68 ] or food [ 67 , 71 ] . The spread and appreciation of food cultivation in home [ 38 ] and community gardens [ 35 ] is based on real or perceived individual benefits through the promotion of health and nutritional aspects , access to nature and the creation of opportunities for social engagement [ 114 ] as well as for well - being [ 36 ] . Recent work has aimed to enable “growth on the ground” in terms of the active democratic participation of ‘food citizens’ in a local food hub [ 86 ] or to support urban foraging [ 24 ] . 2 . 3 ICT and Scaling The role of IT has been explored in HCI , and there are growing calls for scaling up actions that ad - dress sustainability [ 54 ] . Some contributions have sought to understand how design can support at the community level [ 11 , 61 , 62 ] . In examining a Danish organic food community and its artifact ecology , Bødker et al . observed three phases : becoming a community , being an everyday com - munity , and building anew [ 12 ] . Similarly , Biørn - Hansen and Håkansson identified three design implications for scaling up change based on interviews with ten sustainability - oriented commu - nity organizers [ 11 ] : ( 1 ) “design to tap into existing resources and infrastructures when possible , and try to re - define ‘original’ practices” , ( 2 ) design “ [ to foster ] the collaboration between similar ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . From Surplus and Scarcity toward Abundance 80 : 5 grass - root initiatives” and ( 3 ) design “to empower community organizations and similar groups not only with technical solutions but also with ICT knowledge and skills” . Practical approaches include Foodsharing , a German - speaking movement that is supported by a platform ( foodsharing . de ) [ 91 , 94 ] , a Facebook page [ 34 ] and its publicly accessible distribution sites [ 72 ] . “Commoning” , as it is often called [ 17 , 73 , 110 ] , has frequently entailed innovative experimentation with ICT in the field of urban food sharing [ 9 , 21 , 23 ] . ICT - supported food sharing can support sustainability by increasing efficiency along the food chain [ 27 ] , diversifying income streams and improving food security [ 23 ] as well as by leading to the building and maintenance of lively and meaningful so - cial relationships [ 9 , 10 ] and paving the way for new economic vitality [ 14 , 95 ] . Davies et al . have demonstrated that food sharing protagonists consider “ICT as a key driver in the stretching of spaces across which sharing can take place , extending the potential for sharing beyond kinship or familial interactions to an activity that can occur between strangers or bring diverse groups of people together through new communities of sharing practice” [ 23 ] . Jaeggi and Gurven empha - size that “ [ f ] ood sharing is a fundamental form of cooperation that [ . . . ] is particularly noteworthy because of its central role in shaping human life history , social organization , and cooperative psy - chology” [ 50 ] . In the context of food sharing , practices such as community gardening and urban food - growing communities [ 43 – 45 , 64 ] also exist , but to understand the role of ICT and scaling in this context , there are still further investigations needed [ 4 ] . Addressing the issues of platform capitalism ( e . g . , scaling for profit ) , recent contributions have reflected on the positioning of co - design [ 5 ] and invite the participatory design community to look into the commons and commoning [ 13 ] . Poderi , for instance , bases a “paradigmatic case of platform as commons” on Free and Open Source Software ( FOSS ) [ 83 ] . According to Hirsch [ 47 ] , research on small - scale food production lies at the heart of the SHCI debate described above . If true , then grassroots movements that seek to bring about economic , environmental , and social change should be a focus . These movements are a wellspring of inno - vation [ 99 ] and have the power to leverage the resources necessary for a transformation toward sustainability [ 28 , 105 ] . Collective actions are often organized and coordinated using various digital artefacts , but HCI still lacks a wider understanding of grassroots movements and their commu - nities , their operating cycles , and the role that technology plays in shaping identity , promoting collective actions , and supporting community engagement [ 78 ] . Some recent comparative work has urged caution about “scaling” seen as a technical matter and shown the distinct pathways that grassroots communities can adopt in pursuit of change [ 56 ] and draws attention to the different senses in which we can talk about , in their words , proliferation , and the need to understand the ecology of practices involved . 2 . 4 Sharing Economy as a Challenge to Global Capitalism As mentioned above , much of the current HFI research in the context of food sharing practices supports food sharing to avoid food waste . The platform foodsharing . de , a major element of the food sharing movement in Germany , exemplifies this . Ganglbauer et al . describe the early years of the grassroots movement , its Facebook page , and the platform that enabled the peer - to - peer function “food baskets” , through which users could share food with other people . Here , too , the main motivation of the initiators and participants was to create awareness of—and thus to avoid—food waste [ 34 ] . Additional functions after a merger with another service—“savingfood . de” ( lebensmittelretten . de ) —included coordinating pick - ups from food supermarkets , canteens , and so on . It has been argued among volunteers and other stakeholders in foodsharing . de , however , that the platform militates against local , face - to - face meeting and further that pursuing the redistribu - tion of surplus for profit reasons can create a market interest in maintaining food waste . ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . 80 : 6 P . Engelbutzeder et al . Grassroots movements that pursue the goal of preventing food waste , by achieving this goal , arguably make themselves unnecessary in the longer term ( as stated in the wiki on foodsharing . de and in [ 8 ] ; see also [ 108 ] . Thus , any wider benefits in relation to participatory and / or educational objectives are unlikely to be met if food redistribution is not linked with other sustainable food practices , such as cooking together or community gardening . The distinct separation between provider and beneficiary remains , especially in “sharing for charity” [ 66 ] , and a stigma is attached to “low - income” contexts [ 77 ] . That is , self - sufficiency is not a significant feature of the agenda and instead remains only a means to redistribute existing—and finite—resources . Put simply , mere food sharing has an opportunity cost : the more I share with you , the less I can share with anyone else . In this way , debates about food sharing parallel debates about the wider “sharing economy” ( the term has no agreed - upon definition and is also called “collaborative consumption” [ 14 ] ) and about the degree to which the so - called “zero - marginal - cost” society [ 88 ] poses a challenge to capitalism . The debate on the sharing economy [ 59 ] has , in particular , led to the critique of its ( sometimes ) profit - oriented foundations [ 22 , 62 ] . There is little doubt , as Norton et al . point out [ 76 ] , that “ [ u ] nsustainability in food systems is predicated on inequality . For actors in a food system to regain and retain sovereignty , they must have an ability to control the production of their own food . Currently , a few global actors control a majority of global food production ; this leads to inequality and unsustainability on several levels . ” Landwehr et al . explore an example in which reclaiming food sovereignty involves precisely a confluence of production and distribution / sharing practices and the role that ICT can play in supporting these practices [ 57 ] . Moreover , at the surveyed community supported agriculture , the authors discuss , ICT was central to achieving demand orientation , which strengthened trust in the farm and ultimately the solidarity between community members . In the following , we use the term “sharing” in Belk’s sense [ 6 , 7 ] . This excludes commercial trans - actions and the platforms upon which they are transacted . Thus , to reiterate , one part of our ob - jective is to refocus attention away from notions of scarcity—closely allied as they are to orthodox economic conceptions of marginal utility for the consumer and marginal cost for the producer— and toward a more genuinely cooperative view of consumption and production practices—one that is associated with the concept of the “prosumer” [ 90 ] . The focus on food resource sharing that we provide below aims to—at least to a degree—dissolve the distinction between “rival” and “non - rival” goods [ 16 , 74 ] . In orthodox economics , almost all private goods are rivalrous , meaning that use by one person precludes use by another . We advocate for a move toward a view that emphasizes a more “public” or shared conception of goods . As Norton et al . [ 76 ] argue , “ [ a ] priority is to work with small , highly motivated social movements on bottom - up change toward food sovereignty , while considering the policy context” . 3 CONTEXT : THE GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT AND ITS PROJECT Foodroots Community is a local grassroots movement organized around sustainable food practices . Many of the founding members have been part of the local district of the wider grassroots move - ment of Foodsharing ( foodsharing . de ) . The community has been involved in a wide range of activi - ties , which include community gardening , community cooking , and food ( re - ) distribution . Various projects are run independently , though they sometimes overlap . Over about eight months , around 7 – 10 people organized communal events , came together for discussions , and initiated projects that had inclusive , pluralist intentions . Over 100 other people contributed at different times and in various forms . At the beginning , two workshops on the vision of the Foodroots Community highlighted the need to encourage connections within the community through mutual learning ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . From Surplus and Scarcity toward Abundance 80 : 7 and to foster inclusivity by encouraging people to share and contribute what they can and espe - cially to bring together different generations and cultures . We note that COVID - 19 has , at certain points , influenced the project through physical distancing . Severe restrictions were in place for about 15 months , so engagement then necessarily took place through the use of ICT , although the people were all based in the same locality . Nevertheless , a significant part of the activities de - scribed took place after restrictions were lifted and the project has lasted for over two years . The Telegram group , in particular , proved—as we shall see—to be a significant vehicle for the various activities that surround food resource sharing . We will argue that , although its use was initially prompted by external factors , there are clear lessons here in relation to scalability . The coordination and organizational structure of Foodroots Community is informed by “hier - archy sensitivity” . Participation is always welcomed and supported . Ideologically , it was felt that supporting self - empowerment processes , rather than coordinating centrally , was desirable . This was prompted by the realization that the existing platform ( WeChange ) was underused and that participation in organized meetings had been declining . Thus , while 2 – 3 online meetings per week were held early on , these were not followed up over time because many participants felt that “too much was planned and too little was done” . WeChange was largely dropped by the active orga - nizers of Foodroots Community after some time . The overall lack of use ( and maintenance ) of WeChange led to an increasing focus on Telegram , in which several subgroups—for example , for construction work , cooking events , or an info - channel—were created . The use of Telegram , even so , also tends to be associated with specific activities . The idea for the Chili Project was shared by Alina , one of the active organizers , during one of the first video chats and was received enthusiastically . Alina proposed that , having grown a number of chili plants , these be shared amongst “adopters” . Adoptive parents were offered a digital com - munication platform with the aim of learning about the care , diversity , and growth of plants as well as about harvesting chilies and distributing seeds . After a first brainstorming session , the con - tributors agreed to invite children and elderly people , in particular , because they thought that this process would involve people outside of their own “social bubble” . The initiators set up both , the Telegram group and mailing list so that the participants could ask questions and the experts would then provide answers , and from the questions they would create learning modules that would help the adoptive parents with care and harvesting . From providing two different ICT - mediated ways to participate , the organizers aimed to be as inclusive as possible : Telegram was already a plat - form used by many sustainable initiatives in the city , while a mailing list was estimated to have the least barriers for the majority of participants . Advertising was done personally and through social media . In addition , Author One invited retirement homes , and two joined the project . Telegram is a cloud - based messenger application that enables message exchange between users , group messaging , and the channel - based distribution of information as well as third - party appli - cation integration and audio and video calls on smartphones , browser clients , and desktop ap - plications . In addition , the secret chat feature provides encrypted user - to - user messaging . These messaging capabilities have enabled communication for vast digital communities ranging from po - litical organizations and local sharing communities to communication among friends , colleagues , and family members . 4 METHOD 4 . 1 Authors’ Positioning This study draws on an action - oriented research approach [ 42 ] , defined as “generating knowl - edge through applied collaborative activist - community interventions that can simultaneously contribute to local communities and add to general knowledge” . Author One has been involved ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . 80 : 8 P . Engelbutzeder et al . in the German Foodsharing movement for seven years and worked as an activist with the de - signers and developers of the open - source platform “foodsharing . de” . About four years ago , Au - thor One left these national and international endeavors of Foodsharing and engaged more locally with Foodsharing in Siegen ( Germany ) . This was prompted by the desire to rethink the problem of global food supplies by focusing on what can be done locally . Therefore , the aim was to under - stand how to extend the scope of sustainable food practices by including food literacy , communal gardening , and communal cooking , and to understand what role ICT plays in that . This involved , inter alia , working with the owners of three recently founded community gardens and a commu - nal kitchen in Siegen . This has meant systematic , long term active involvement in the emergence of the Foodroots Community . He has been substantially responsible for coordination and organi - zation ( like scheduling or moderating a meeting ) . For the Chili Project , Author One was one of three main organizers . 4 . 2 Data Collection and Analysis To better understand food resource sharing practices , we draw on various datasets in order to provide a rich understanding of the context of Foodroots Community , from which the Chili Project emerged , and the role ICT played in food resource sharing within the Chili Project ( see Table 2 ) . Firstly , this included data from the Telegram groups in Foodroots Community as well as the WeChange platform and recordings from video chats of Foodroots Community ( a time period of three years ) . Members were self - recruiting , we placed no restrictions on who might wish to get involved . Personal engagement was documented by field notes . Secondly , we monitored and collected data from a mailing list and the Telegram group through which the Chili Project was coordinated . The data for the Chili Project includes the period from its start in February 2020 until the start of the second Chili Project in February 2021 . Author One conducted 21 semi - structured interviews : 20 in person ( 3 interviews were con - ducted with 2 interviewees being present ) and 1 via video chat in order to gain more insight into emergent themes using an interview guide . The interviewees were participants of Foodroots Com - munity and / or Chili Project and were asked via a private message on Telegram for an interview . The interviews covered questions about community , food ( resource ) sharing practices , community , and sustainability , as well as areas in which ICT might support ( desired ) practices . Furthermore , we asked interviewees about their view on contributing to a change toward sustainability on a local and global level . The interviews were 79 minutes long on average , with the shortest lasting 18 minutes and the longest 142 minutes . The interviews were transcribed for further analysis . The age of the interviewees ranged from 20 to 78 years , and the average age was 44 years . Among the respondents were 19 women and 5 men . Their professions were diverse . We analyzed our data by drawing on the thematic analysis approach [ 107 ] . Author One repeat - edly re - read the materials ( especially the transcriptions , field notes , and Telegram conversations ) and organized the material by using a fundamentally inductive approach , grouping selected data items together for similarities . The emerging themes were then discussed with the other authors and iteratively developed into the categories presented below . These processes were ongoing and took place over a long period of time , not least because new data was continually available . All quotes from the interviewees below have been translated into English from German . Finally , our research was conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines established by the university the authors worked for , and included guarantees of anonymity and permissions for data to be used . All participants who joined the Chili Project were informed about the active role of Author One in the group . All participants to Foodroots Community were informed about Au - thor One’s research activities , and all the interviews were conducted in line with privacy - and ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 .

The results are presented in the context of the Foodsharing movement , which as we have pointed out , mainly aims to save and redistribute sur - plus ( Chapter 3 ) . Author One had joined the local Foodsharing community in Siegen as an action researcher aiming to orient the group toward wider food sharing practices and with a view to getting a better sense of the role of ICT as membership grew ( Chapter 4 ) . After the chilies were distributed , ICT opened a common space for interested participants and supported them in the sharing of food resources with each other on an ongoing basis , including resources beyond chilies , chili seeds , or experiences growing chilies . We were able to observe and elaborate below on how , with some face - to - face support ( pre - and post - COVID ) from the action - orientated researchers for the volunteers and guests , a Telegram group was sufficient for further food resource sharing practices to take place on a continuing basis . We argue below , in relation to the global challenges posed by capitalism ( Section 3 ) and the urgent need for “deep change” in food systems [ 112 ] that there are possibilities for scalable networking effects in the interplay between local actions and global challenges . 5 . 1 Supporting the Emergence of a Community of Interest While the sharing of pre - grown chili plants was the starting point of the Chili Project , it soon evolved with the support of ICT to foster the emergence of a community of interest . In the follow - ing subsections , we will provide some insight into the role that ICT played in this process . 5 . 1 . 1 General Insights . To adopt a chili , interested people were invited to write an email to Foodroots Community . Before the chili plant was handed over to the participants , they were asked by email if they would like to participate in Telegram and were invited to do so with a link . While most participants picked up their chili plants , some chilies were also distributed to participants’ homes or to participants randomly on the street along with an invitation to also join the Telegram group and mailing list . Of the approximately 70 people who adopted a chili plant , 48 found their way into the Telegram group . Those participants who did not join sought no interaction with a wider community but were “just” interested in getting a chili plant . There were a total of 757 messages and 388 reactions in the group over the period of time we monitored . Of the 48 participants , 5 made no contribu - tion , 22 made less than 10 contributions , 12 contributed between 10 and 29 times , 5 contributed between 30 and 59 times , and 4 contributed between 60 and 95 times . The self - designed stick - ers ( which were drawn for the first info flyer that was handed out together with the chili plant and which was later digitalized by Vera ; see Figure 1 ) were sent 27 times . All participants inter - viewed reported that they had enjoyed participating in the Telegram group , actively contributing to the conversation or checking for news every day . The conversations in the Telegram group were ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . From Surplus and Scarcity toward Abundance 80 : 11 described as “effervescent , active , and funny” by Vera , and Sandra reported that the group had “a good atmosphere” . All participants provided their email address and were put on a mailing list . In total , two emails were sent from the organizers but received no further response . The mailing list was abandoned afterwards . Over the five months of the Chili Project ( see [ 26 ] ) , communication mainly took place via the Telegram group . Project initiators considered a video - chat function , but this turned out to be of minor interest to the participants , especially if the communication was unfocused , but some were interested in specific topics . For some participants , the Telegram group of the Chili Project was the only purpose for which they used Telegram . For them , Telegram was their “chili platform” . Later , some joined the other Telegram groups of the Foodroots Community , and Telegram was perceived as their “gardening platform” . All participants who had not used Telegram before ex - plained that they were familiar with the interfaces of other instant messengers , such as WhatsApp . All participants found Telegram easy to use , but some needed a little assistance ( see below ) . 5 . 1 . 2 ICT as an Entry Point for Joining a Wider Community of Interest . Through their partic - ipation , the adoptive parents found an easy point of entry into the community that had formed around the Chili Project , and especially into its main means of communication , the Telegram group , in which they could determine their participation at their own pace . Furthermore , the use of ICT prompted several reflections . Merle said , “I learned quite a bit about seeds and the tips and tricks that were shared via Telegram . And I thought a lot about what I need to feel like I belong . What it’s like to get into existing groups and kind of realize what I need there , too , and what’s difficult for me . [ . . . ] And basically , how I get connected with groups that I find completely exciting at first , when I’m somehow completely new to them and don’t actually know anyone . ” Some participants found their entry point through the Chili Project into the wider community of Foodroots Community and Foodsharing , like Linda , who described herself as being curious about the urban gardening movement in Siegen : “Well , for me personally , I actually found the Chili Project first , so I got to know who the people behind it were . ” Linda had come to one of the communal gardens of Foodroots Community twice and also supported the emergence of another communal garden of an anarcho - syndical organization 100 meters away from Foodroots Commu - nity’s second communal garden . 5 . 1 . 3 The Intimacy of the Project . It soon became clear that the contributions regarding the development were not limited to the growth of the chilies , and the questions that were asked ad - dressed far more than chili care . Instead , the group of chili parents shared their personal reports on Telegram , describing an “intimate” relationship with the plant that included , for instance , talking to it on a regular basis . As Alina stated , “It’s very peculiar how . . . how personal that . . . that kind of personal relationship people build up with their plant . . . that they give it a name and are obviously very sad when their chili plant dies or has aphids or something . I think . . . So it definitely . . . We created the project that way , too . So , it’s always been like that . So , the Chili Project is a bit like . . . Like there is something living that is looking for shelter . . . and so you also do something good when you take in the plant . And also—I think a big part of it is definitely also the illustration . That personifies the plant . ” 5 . 1 . 4 No unfamiliar ICT Wanted . Since the project was designed to enable participants to share the development of their chili plant with the other adoptive parents and to get expert support on questions about their chili , it was not surprising that experience and expertise were shared in the Telegram group through texts and photos . One of the participants , Luisa , shared 18 external websites or YouTube videos about gardening and chilies . Interestingly , such content generated no ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . 80 : 12 P . Engelbutzeder et al . responses . Participants seemed much more interested in the connection with local experts and in a local community of interest for sharing experience and expertise . Voice messages , videos , and ( video ) calls were not used . Sharing photos of chili plants , in con - trast , supported participants’ ability to see if their chili was doing well . Merle wrote about this in the group chat : “Now that I have seen the other chilies , ours is clearly curling , or rather the leaves . . . what is the reason for this ? ” The community concluded that it was because of aphids and provided guidance to get rid of them . While Telegram itself was easy to use for all participants , some of them explicitly did not want to use any other unfamiliar applications . Within the Telegram group , the questions asked regarding the chilies were supposed to be gathered in a Pad ( a web - based collaborative real - time editor ) that Alina had initiated and posted in the group in order to create learning modules from it . Although 19 questions were collected and Alina constructed a learning module , participants reported on how they had clicked on the link to the Pad but instantly closed it because a new application had opened up . The Pad was subsequently abandoned . As Carina stated , “It always annoys me when I have many things in different places . When I first log in , I have to get used to how the system works . [ . . . ] I always like to make just one click and then have what I need in terms of information . [ . . . ] It frustrates me when I then have such a platform again . I think the Chili Project also tried that once with [ . . . ] this , I don’t know what it was called , the extra page where the module was supposed to be created . I’ve never looked at it , for example , because that’s too much work for me . [ . . . ] When I look at it once , I get overwhelmed , and I close it again . That’s why I always like to use things that I already have . That way , it’s much easier for me to use them again somehow . [ . . . ] I don’t feel like digging into new things . I have to do that again and again at work . I have to put a lot of mental input into it , and I don’t feel like digging into something like that privately in the evening . That is only for work . ” Our findings demonstrate that Telegram offers support for people to engage in food resource sharing practices on a local level . Telegram is particularly useful for expanding these practices be - cause it offers an easy - to - understand , minimal - overhead start for interested people . Nevertheless , it turned out that some people from the Chili Project needed a little personal support in actual face - to - face meetings , for example , to install the application or to learn how to take and send pic - tures . It is also important for the local context to find out which additional functions of Telegram were important for the people involved . The video function was useful for the residents of the re - tirement home . Furthermore , functions that are important for coordination and organization can be developed for Telegram and integrated into it because most of the code for the various client apps is free and open - source ( under the GNU General Public License version 2 or 3 ) , and Telegram offers an extensive API to create bots . Telegram turns out to be very useful for encouraging the sharing of resources : There are opportunities for users to list the resources they need or offer and could be connected through a matching algorithm . In urban food sharing initiatives , seeds , shoots , food products , compost , tools , land , preparation services , kitchen devices as well as experience and expertise are especially often shared . However , Davies and Legg remind us that “ [ t ] here are also less tangible things that are shared in relation to growing , food preparation , and eating . This includes the sharing of spaces and meals through eating together , often with the goal of creating greater social interaction , integration , or conviviality” [ 24 ] . These were manifested , in our case , through occasional meetings in urban gardens or through a “seed - sharing” event , to mention two . 5 . 1 . 5 The Issue of Shared Contribution within a Voluntary Project . The first learning module was created after one month and had a colorful design and additional drawings ( that again became Telegram stickers ) . The lack of time for Alina , however , meant that such modules were not further held . However , both she and other participants continued to send text messages with relevant ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . From Surplus and Scarcity toward Abundance 80 : 13 information . In this context , several questions were asked and answered within the Telegram group . Alina frequently expressed to Author One that she wanted to fully dedicate herself to Food - roots Community and the Chili Project but that she had to pursue too many other tasks , especially her paying job . This raises a complex issue of rights and responsibilities among volunteers ( re - solved , in this instance , through funding from a subsequent project ) . For the main organizers of Foodroots Community and the Chili Project , there was some discus - sion about the need for a degree of central organization , mainly with regard to the distribution of tasks . Some argued , in tandem , for having better ICT - supported organization and coordination of tasks . In contrast , others viewed ICT as less important and instead wanted to encourage people to come , for example , into the communal gardens and contribute right away , especially by taking on daily tasks like watering , which the main organizers often did . Ten months after the idea of the Chili Project emerged Alina ( one of the main organizers ) invited the participants to join the organizational part of the Chili Project for the subsequent year . There - fore , she opened up a new Telegram group and shared the invitation link in the existing Telegram groups of both Chili Project and Foodroots Community . Following on from the first year of the Chili Project , four participants and a friend of a participant joined the group , as well as four of the main organizers from Foodroots Community and two organizers who had handled the design and IT tasks the year before . Alina frequently mentioned to Author One that she could not organize the project by herself and that it was crucial that others accepted an organizational role in order to keep the Chili Project alive . The Chili Project Telegram group proved sufficient for participants to coordinate tasks so that the Chili Project could enter its second year . Two video calls supported more detailed coordination , while the Telegram group was used to schedule the video calls and keep everyone updated on tasks , ask questions about tasks , receive feedback ( e . g . , on design ) , and present final results . Interestingly , the organizers agreed to extend the project to include tomato sharing . This time , participants were to be helped to find the right tomato plant for their growing circumstances and to start sharing seeds instead of pre - grown plants . 5 . 2 Networking Effects The frequency of asked and answered questions led one of the initiators to found a new Tele - gram group . Alina wrote in the Telegram group of the Chili Project : “Since the little chili plant is supposed to be a companion in the cultivation of vegetables in your own garden , I find gardener questions and exchange beyond the chili plant to be totally appropriate in this group . I have been toying with the idea of opening up this type of gardener’s group for Siegen for quite some time now so that people can share knowledge and resources ( e . g . , young plants , seeds , or cooperation ) . I have the feeling that there is increased interest beyond this group : ) . So why not ? ! I will do it . ” 17 participants from the Chili Project followed , via a posted link , this new group , making around 60 participants in all . Similarly , other participants found their way into other Telegram groups that were related to sustainability efforts in Siegen . The developing network was not entirely online . Friends and relatives of the participants were also involved in the breeding of chilies . One participant , Naomi , talked about how her neighbor had taken care of her chili plant at certain times and how the plant had later been planted in her neighbor’s garden because it got more sun there . Naomi also asked her father for advice several times . Furthermore , she encouraged a friend to get a chili plant . In both retirement homes , the involvement of relatives was also significant . In retirement - home _ 1 , whose employees had little experience with gardening , requests were made through the WhatsApp group for relatives who had plants for the new beds of about 30 square meters as well as for the mobile bed ( which had been spontaneously built from a discarded garbage truck ) . Many ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . 80 : 14 P . Engelbutzeder et al . relatives contributed something , with one relative participating in the joint construction of a raised bed at retirement - home _ 2 that had been initiated by participants of the Chili Project and Foodroots Community . The interviewed chili parents all said that they wanted to get to know the other participants personally . Quite a few interviewees said that they had gotten to know someone through this medium and looked forward to a personal meeting , such as a communal chili cooking event . Food - roots Community organized a seed exchange in one of the community gardens , and eight adoptive chili parents from the Chili Project actively participated . Further meetings were initiated by par - ticipants of the Foodroots Community , and Bea , for instance , came into a communal garden and offered a tour of wild herbs . A local youth organization invited others to participate in the “chili challenge” by caring for one of their many chilies . Later , the initiators discovered that some of the people from the youth organization had attended one of Foodroots Community’s “seed - sharing” events earlier in the year and were inspired to grow chilis from their own chili seeds to share with others , even though they had initially been unaware of the Chili Project . The point here is that though activities had originally taken place as part of the chili - plant project , other activities sprang up and became more or less independent from the project . For the most part , networking personal relationships were crucial and ICT only played a minor role ( like discussing the growth of the chili plants with relatives ) . 5 . 3 Global Issues and Local Actions Participants frequently talked about the scope and scale of the project and expressed the desire to see wider effects while also stressing the importance of locality . Rosina , who was committed to sustainability issues , stated , “Sometimes , I get tired and I think that everything is getting on my nerves , and I don’t want to [ contribute to a change toward sustainability ] anymore . There’s no point , anyway . But then , it helps to have to deal again and again with people like you at a local level . ” Through ICT , participants were able to observe activities coordinated or reported on in other Telegram groups dedicated to local sustainability efforts but also began to recognize the relevance of their activities to global challenges . Linda stated , “It’s about making a local contribution , and then another small contribution is made somewhere else , and then things snowball and get bigger . [ . . . ] So that’s where we should start . That way , no one in this world should go hungry or thirsty anymore . ” This panned out , for some participants of the Chili Project , in a willingness to provide practical as well as symbolic support for the Foodroots Community . Thus , Stephanie declared , “If the need is there , I will gladly join in . ” Similarly , Tom stated that he was happy to support any endeavor with his skills , like building raised beds , though less willing to participate in meetings that addressed planning and coordination . 5 . 4 A Local Community Striving toward Abundance Food resource sharing , as initially done in the Chili Project , opened up the space for further food resource sharing to emerge and thereby supported the development of local communities in Siegen . The communities are predicated on trust in an organization in which everyone is encouraged to make a complementary contribution in order to nurture the idea of doing “just enough” or of being “self - sufficient” , which we frame as abundance . For the Chili Project the Telegram group offered a space in which further food resource sharing was supported and participants could find a way to contribute . Participants , for instance , shared gardening expertise or help at a “seed - sharing” event . In so doing , Telegram provided a common communication base that anyone interested could join in and participate in group communication . To be sure , instant messaging on Telegram does not ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . From Surplus and Scarcity toward Abundance 80 : 15 offer a high degree of sophistication , but for the Chili Project seemed to provide ‘just enough’ support for the burgeoning of community involvement . 5 . 4 . 1 Supporting Participants in Sharing their Experience and Expertise . While many of the par - ticipants found their way into the Chili Project group via a link , others needed support : Hans , whom the initiators wanted to win over as an expert , got involved after Author One had provided technical assistance through a personal meeting . At this meeting , he downloaded Telegram , and the Chili Project group was set up to make his participation possible . Since then , Hans has an - swered questions regularly and has given tips on activities . When Therese and Author One met over a video chat in the context of another project , Therese asked if Author One could come by to support her in the Telegram group of the Chili Project . It was especially important for Therese to learn how to share photos of her chili with the group . She learned how to do this with the sup - port of Author One and subsequently posted several photos . She later learned about issues such as archiving with some personal help . These two examples illustrate that for people to be able to contribute through ICT , small amounts of personal assistance from the more expert members of the community may be necessary in supporting the appropriation of ICT . At the same time , the involvement of the retirement homes was a challenge . The management of retirement - home _ 1 and a caregiver from retirement - home _ 2 agreed to participate in the project and joined the Telegram group . While neither the home management nor the staff at retirement - home _ 1 had any experience with gardening , the supervisor at retirement - home _ 2 had already grown tomatoes and strawberries with the residents . Both Michaela and Marietta reported how happy and proud the residents were of the plants . At retirement - home _ 1 , Marietta reported how the caregiver would hold the garden hose for watering while the residents determined where ex - actly and how much water should be poured . Put simply , mutual learning was taking place . Marietta said in the interview that “ [ . . . ] for all of us who stand next to [ the residents in the garden ] every day , it is really always heartwarming , and it has already led to one or two tears . . . You can see the residents’ bright smiles , and they also tell me what they used to do at home and knock on my door at eight o’clock in the morning and ask when they can go back to weeding” ( Marietta , retirement - home _ 1 ) . Both nursing homes found the inclusion of the residents in the Telegram group to be difficult . However , Marietta said that videos of Foodroots Community and the Chili Project could be well received by the residents if she could show them on a screen ( something which has not yet been implemented ) . Michaela liked the idea , as well , and other pensioners from the community gar - dens who did not participate in any Telegram group also welcomed it . The cooperation with the retirement homes made it clear that in the context of ICT for certain people there is a need for an external ‘“mediator” who passes on information to the participants and exchanges experiences with them . 5 . 4 . 2 Sharing Food Resources ( Goods ) . For almost five months , the participants of the Telegram group continually shared food resources ( goods ) . In total , there were ten offers within the Telegram group for the Chili Project . Furthermore , participants reported that they also shared seeds , shoots , and plants in the newly founded Telegram gardening group as well as when meeting at a communal garden or a public kitchen . For the purpose of sharing , requests and offers were written , whereas a photo was usually also sent for offering food resources . All goods that were requested or offered in the Telegram group were related to seeds , shoots , or plants , as well as to fruits and vegetables for harvesting . The goods that were offered were mostly unplanned and abundantly available from those offering them . Bea , for example , wrote that she could share wild garlic because it grows abundantly in her garden . Clara read that Nina had been ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . 80 : 16 P . Engelbutzeder et al . looking after an avocado plant , and since she had many avocado plants , she wrote to Nina privately on Telegram and gave her one . The interview with the participants was also used to share goods related to plants . For example , Author One was given special food made from chilies or herbs several times or asked in advance whether certain plants or seeds could be taken along . In the interviews , the respondents stated that they were not surprised that resources were re - peatedly shared , and some put this down to the positive atmosphere in the Telegram group . One of the initiators , Vera , said , “It doesn’t surprise me . I know about WhatsApp groups for Foodsharing – very simple , with picture and text” , and concluded that people like to share and to help with a resource that is in surplus or abundant . Sandra also stated , “I would say I would have expected [ resource sharing ] to take place at least 51 % of the time . ” Sharing food resources also involved other friends and relatives of the participants ( see above : Networking Effects ) . As Rosina reported , “My grandchildren liked the cherry picking , for example . They still talk about it today . That was a big hit . It was better than going to the supermarket and buying cherries , right ? ” The cherry picking itself was done in a private garden where someone new to Foodroots Community offered the harvest . The participants of the Chili Project were invited to join , and six came to harvest . Later , they brought fruit to other participants who could not join . Sharing food resources was also extended by one participant to a wider circle of people . Lara ini - tiated a “mobile seed fair” ( a flexible plastic post card holder with around 30 pockets that contained different packaged seeds ) in order to support food resource sharing and introduced it together with Author One at a local park . For Lara , it was important to realize her idea while also removing her - self from sole responsibility and giving in to a self - organized process that was supported by a tracker : “I like things to be mobile and then to keep going . So , for example , I can’t guarantee that I’ll always be responsible for it in one year or that people can get in touch with me if they want seeds . That’s just too much for me . But if people approach me , I can say , “Where is the mobile seed ferry right now ? ” Then , I can maybe look somewhere and say , “Hey , who has it right now ? ” and then tell the person . Or I can say that it’s in the free shop [ a local store that accepts and gives away items without the exchange of money ] . And then , if I ever [ . . . ] have an event or a reading and I’d like to hang [ the seed fair ] next to it , I can do that . So , I like the fact that it’s as modular and mobile as possible and does not depend on individual people . . . because experience has shown that that always backfires [ . . . ] , especially when everything is voluntar y , honorar y work . And sooner or later , everything shuts down . It fades away . And no one feels responsible . ” The participants of the Chili Project Telegram group coordinated the exchange of resources between themselves mainly via personal messages on Telegram . They then arranged a pick - up time and date and shared the goods . Bea , who is very sensitive about food waste and had offered wild garlic from her garden , said that she did not mind that nobody had picked it up : “I mean , it’s no big deal , [ . . . ] it will be absorbed [ by the earth ] , and then it will be gone again . Nothing happens . Nature gets everything back . It’s not like you have to use it up . ” This statement leads us to further insights about the differences between surplus and abundance : While the former requires urgent redistribution / usage , the latter draws on circular processes . In regard to the tension between surplus and abundance , Stephanie contributed the following reflections on her food practices : “The bell pepper seeds [ . . . ] , I used to throw them away . Now , I have jars ever y where with many seeds lying around . So , I think that’s good . I find that you can that . . . only if you already know how they grow . So , the first chili on the bush is something great , right ? I think that’s good and , really , that you also deal more with the plants themselves , right ? ” Being a prosumer for the first time in her life , her perception of the seeds shifted from waste ( surplus that would need to be saved from being thrown away , by redistributing it ) toward ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . From Surplus and Scarcity toward Abundance 80 : 17 a recognition of the value of the abundant nature of “home grown” supply , in which the food resources needed are already there . There can , on occasion , be an explicitly ideological motive for participation . This is evident when considering the role of money . Respondents said that money plays no or only a subordinate role and should have no influence on the project in the future because the connection to money could endanger the grassroots movement . Tom even sees the project as antithetical to capitalist formulations since it is independent even of explicit exchange value . The Chili Project operates instead , he suggested , on a profound level of the food supply : “Who has what , and who needs what . ” Tom reported that when they picked up pumpkin seedlings or offered lavender , there was no consideration of giving or asking for anything in exchange . He suspects that more chilies have been distributed than if Foodroots Community had tried to sell them . Inspired by the Chili Project , Tom and his wife Carina are considering opening their garden to others for shared cultivation . In a similar vein , Stephanie saw the sharing of chilies as a catalyst for further sharing , oriented at abundance rather than surplus : “There is a purpose behind it , after all . It isn’t just , ’I’ll give you a chili plant’ , like , because I have too many of them . It has meaning . ” Similarly , Tom reported , “With the chili plants , you can achieve a very brilliant coup . It is simple , it is subliminal : People come , and everything is linked from the beginning with the basic idea of paying [ the harvested chili seeds ] forward , and thus with a longer temporal perspective . And there is a permanent temporal develop - ment , so people come back to the topic again and again . ” ( See also [ 60 ] , who explore the possible roles of seasonal rhythms for the design of technologies to support temporal coordination ) . In terms of the role of ICT , the Telegram group prepares a sufficient opportunity for this . Beyond seeds , plants , and their harvest , Udo argued for a circular economy that supports local composting practices in order to produce fertile soil in abundance : “In my view , sustainability can only ever work in a cycle - based system . And for me , that would mean rethinking things . It would mean taking very small practical steps . That way , for example , it would be necessary for every house to have a compost bin . [ . . . ] Or , if you like , not even that , but that all the organic waste that is collected here should actually be processed into compost in a regenerative way in municipal fa - cilities , communal facilities , which , in turn , are used to prepare soil or build vegetable beds . ” Udo’s comments make it clear that Foodroots Community is aiming for further projects , aimed at ma - terial growth . It is doubtful , however , that the Telegram group’s capabilities are sufficient to cope with the coordinative and organizational effort that would be needed . The results make it clear that ‘abundance’ is not a status to be achieved , but is , as it were , a continuous ideological com - mitment to a way of thinking about community resources , and that ( ICT - ) support for abundance accordingly requires further development . 6 DISCUSSION Our study provides insight into the small ( often ICT - supported ) contributions that local commu - nities can make in order to impact global food system challenges via the promotion of prosumer practices . In this context , our contributions lie in describing food resource sharing practices in a local community and the role of ICT in supporting these practices , reconceptualizing the poten - tial focus of HCI on food such that the potential of a focus on food resources and “abundance” is recognized , and drawing attention to the tension between redistributional surplus and abundance and the future possibility of a “glocal” impact . The study we present placed a particular focus on the social aspects of the role of ICT in food re - source sharing . We know from previous work that sharing in general is a social matter and our aim here was to demonstrate the importance of sharing knowledge , sharing resources , and expand - ing ambition when producing food resources as much as when distributing them . “Food resource sharing” highlights a novel and important design space that represents an intersection of HFI and ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . 80 : 18 P . Engelbutzeder et al . SHCI . This is because the fragility of global supply chains and their effects on climate change have major long - term consequences [ 69 , 70 ] . Local activity , as we argue , has a potentially “glocal” effect . If this is to be realized , however , it is important to understand what prompts people to get involved , what leads them to continue their involvement and even to expand it . The detailed examination above can be further distilled into six broad themes : ( 1 ) Firstly , continued involvement depended on affective factors . Participants regularly spoke of intimacy , caring , and enjoyment . ( 2 ) Secondly , low levels of organizational work were needed and much of the proliferation of activities was serendipitous . ( 3 ) Thirdly , and in the same way , the sharing of knowledge and expertise required little in the way of structure and was in the main done through casual asking and answering . ( 4 ) Fourthly , though the project initially had a specific focus , participants took it upon them - selves to widen perspectives through the sharing of other goods ( various seeds , pumpkin seedlings ; cherries ; and so on ) . ( 5 ) Fifthly , our work shows that the role of ICT at this local level is one that provides an adequate resource but needs to carry with it little or no overhead . ( 6 ) Sixthly , small level of ( ICT - ) support from the ranks of the community can be sufficient in order to enable people to contribute to the community . The Telegram group proved to be sufficient for the community of the Chili Project to flourish toward abundance , yet it was clear that further development of Chili Project and especially the Foodroots Community will bring new needs regarding ICT . In connection with the current lit - erature , we suggest further investigation into the role of technology in food resource sharing as it scales or proliferates beyond the immediate locality . We frame much of what we have to say around the notion of “abundance” and the view that productive research can be , and needs to be , conducted into the potential of local food production capacity as part of a communal , socially organized set of activities . We do so as part of a wider argument in which , in addition to the com - pensatory efforts involved in surplus redistribution , we seek to support and generate full - fledged alternatives . In the context of food resource sharing as part of a local grassroot movement , this has meant that “self - sufficiency” is constantly nurtured by the abundance of natural resources that are produced locally . What is shared is a great deal more than a chili plant , since knowledge , expertise , interest , and community involvement also grew . In our study , ICT played a simple but crucial role in supporting these social affairs . 6 . 1 From Surplus toward Abundance The merging of the problem areas of “food waste” and “food poverty” into a kind of win - win situation has been criticized [ 30 , 84 ] . As mentioned above , HFI needs to broaden investigations into the social context and thereby identify where food sharing as a matter of practical policy seems most fruitful and what role the abundance of some food supply might play in this policy . The “deep change” in food systems that we and others [ 112 ] aim to promote requires considerably more than food sharing efforts . Indeed , it is oriented around the principle that the more I share with you , the more will ultimately be shared with others—a non - rivalrous approach ( see Chapter 3 ) . We note that , along with Berns et al . [ 9 ] , this does not imply direct reciprocity . It is better thought of as entailing what Sahlins , an anthropologist , called “generalised reciprocity” [ 93 ] . Food resource sharing that encourages abundant supply , we suggest , can form the foundation for sustainable food practices that transcend the limitations of food sharing as seen as a distri - butional problem . There is , we believe , no natural shortage of the resources needed ; rather , we ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . From Surplus and Scarcity toward Abundance 80 : 19 believe that it is global capitalism that creates food poverty and insecurity and have argued that the sharing economy poses a challenge to it . Food resource sharing at a local level constitutes the first step in building alternatives . A number of benefits , as we have argued , accrue . These include the development of a shared knowledge base for participants , the building of communities of in - terest and the formation of a progressive , wider network effect . Such strategies also do not include compensation [ 7 ] but rather act as catalysts for engagement . Sharing an abundance of chili plants functioned in this way , as the project was designed to support food resource sharing by opening up a space for abundance . The Chili Project Telegram group was enough for this , so that further food resource sharing could and did happen . While these considerations resonate with Vivero Pol’s general ideas about “food as commons” [ 110 ] , the growth of communities or movements that are supported by sharing food resources has not yet played an important role since a focus on individual change prevails [ 112 ] . We agree with Hirsch et al . , who argue that “a positive use of interactive technologies would be to encourage such trends [ i . e . , the rise of alternative food movements ] as a means of bridging divides between ourselves and the natural world [ . . . ] ” [ 47 ] . The resource abundance we encourage can facilitate an exchange between participants and nature , as the caring our participants demonstrated shows . The difference between “food as commons” on an individual and food resource sharing on a community level lies in the collapsing distinction between volunteer providers and beneficiaries , for here , they are one and the same [ 9 ] . Berns et al . , as we have noted , suggest moving beyond a design that solely focuses on efficient exchange to one which includes social factors such as community building and supporting activism . In our work , we have further looked at supporting mutual relationships and communing [ 9 ] . In order to tackle the challenges of “deep change” through different modes of food sharing , we build on the work of Michelini et al . by bringing abundance into the design context . “Sharing for community” as an identified mode for food waste redistribution [ 66 ] operates on a peer - to - peer basis in which “food sharing is managed exclusively through web platforms or apps” ( with no offline replica ) and can—it is argued—strengthen social networks . Although we agree entirely with the view that food resource management will depend on social networks , we feel that the exclusive emphasis on online provision comes with potential costs . We found in our observations that much of the expertise and experience of sharing was indeed done online . Much of the expansion of networks into other areas , such as community gardening or harvesting in other private gardens , however , relied on family and community links . We argue , then , for a better understanding of how family , community , and other ties are implicated in whether and what technologies might prove useful if local food practices are to become more widespread . This change requires shifting the focus from attention on food waste and individualism alone to understanding food sharing practices as socio - cultural activities that unfold in grassroots food initiatives , which connect people . In particular , we suggest studying the use and design of digi - tal tools for cultivating food sharing practices around food resource sharing . Food resources are available in abundance , but they require mechanisms for sharing information about good practice , about corrective practices , about the heterogeneity of our relationship to food growth , and so on . Such expertise sharing , in our view , will require something of a hybrid solution along the lines of Ackermann’s Answer Garden [ 1 , 2 , 81 ] , as we suggest below . Current research on food sharing has not always engaged with locally sharing expertise and experiences with food production or with local food resource goods , both of which can be thought of as resources that are available in abundance . In contrast to a focus on food waste redistribution , our results and other inquiries into food resource sharing practices [ 23 , 43 – 45 , 64 ] suggest that food resource sharing primarily entails sharing the abundantly available , not least because it might generate usable skills and expertise . ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . 80 : 20 P . Engelbutzeder et al . This might provide alternatives to capitalist supply chains that food waste redistribution does not . Doing so , of course , will require support for the expansion of these local practices , and we deal with this below . Technical support in the immediate context of chili plant growing was needed or wanted only in a very limited way . Our participants were not interested in external links , but rather sought advice from people in their local community . The local community’s orientation to the business of sharing experience and expertise was manifested in a “just - enough” attitude . In this context , the instant messenger Telegram proved to provide sufficient support for these activities . However , our adoptive parents were also more than just chili plant volunteers . Indeed , they were ready to engage with a local community of interest by sharing through the means of ICT . Whether or not the participants had a shared interest here was critical . Participants were not interested in playing with computers , nor did they want unnecessary overhead . This meant that possible functionalities , such as open - topic video chat , were not viewed as desirable because participants could not immediately see what they were for . A rather simple ICT resource , a Telegram group , was sufficient to pursue the aims of the project . Two things are evident from our data : Firstly , participants did have a desire to share experiences and sought expertise from local practitioners where needed . Simple technical solutions proved per - fectly adequate for their needs . Typically , the resources that they drew upon were themselves local , consisting entirely of people in the local community who were willing and able ( sometimes with support ) to provide assistance . Secondly , however , participants were often motivated to expand their food practices beyond the chili plant . They actively sought other areas in which they might pursue their food practice interests and contribute to the wider local community . This included , as we have seen , the sharing of other seeds , the development of small communal gardens , and so on . Both of these factors depend on the principles that emphasize that sharing locally is about the local resilience [ 11 ] and social value of connecting people rather than about the global sharing economy , which focuses on superseding the need for social interactions like personal negotiations or codi - fication in favor of trust in digital services [ 61 , 62 ] . According to Biørn – Hansen and Håkansson , in community organizations , “ICT seems to play a more purely ‘functional’ role , whereas it is the members , their time , and dedication that is truly making spreading happening . Meeting people , spending time talking to them , and doing practical things together to share skills so that more people can act on their own , remains to be the key approach” [ 11 ] . Looking into the disparities of the global sharing economy and local community sharing , Light and Miskelly [ 61 ] point out that although local communities might have “limited immediate economic scalability” , they nurture a “sharing culture” that focuses on environmental , economic , and social issues locally , and they can have a wider impact on sustainability with ICT support for growing , spreading [ 11 ] and meshing [ 62 ] . In our case , the “sharing culture” of the Chili Project was initiated by sharing chili plants as food resources and by offering an ICT - facilitated space that supported further food resource sharing in order to nurture the local community to grow towards abundance . In addition , we suggest that a design for food resource sharing that is aligned with surplus can transcend existing practices of waste redistribution , especially in regard to “sharing for charity” [ 66 ] , where the stigma of “low income” can hinder participation and foster dependencies . Surplus generation can act as a catalyst for deeper food resource sharing and the social activities which surround it , such as Disco Soup [ 105 ] , in which saved food is collected and music is played in order to initiate a space in which people can engage in cooking , chatting , and sharing ( see Figure 2 ) . For Foodroots Community , several communal cooking events with saved food from active Foodsharing members , along with dumpster diving activities , have been organized . These have , in turn , formed and fostered the idea of a first communal garden . ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . From Surplus and Scarcity toward Abundance 80 : 21 Fig . 2 . Food sharing and food resource sharing in the context of surplus and abundance . 6 . 2 Complex Food Prosumers We have discussed how food resource sharing at a local level can contribute to a mutual , emergent understanding of sharing resources , which led to a community thriving for abundance . Our ar - gument was in contrast that the focus on consumption in SHCI has been predicated on problems having to do with waste management and related matters and with building solutions out of these problems ( like supporting “food poverty” ) . An alternative way of thinking about the issues can be predicated on the view that food and related resources are not in and of themselves scarce but be - come so because our practices have not , as yet , encompassed new forms of distribution . Therefore , we argue for “deep changes” in the way we address design for sharing practices that would lead us from consumption towards an approach to investigating the complex prosumption practices that are interrelated with food resource sharing rather than with food sharing . Food connects : One of the most common things that people encounter throughout their daily lives is that they have to eat and drink . Sociologist Simmel argues that eating food is “the most egoistic thing , the most unconditional , and most directly limited to the individual : what I think , I can let others know ; what I see , I can let them see ; what I talk , hundreds can hear—but what the individual eats , under no circumstances can another eat . ” However , food practices still spark a custom of being united [ 102 ] . The dual role of individual necessity and meaningful solidarity in food practices gives rise to our desired focus on prosumption practices . The encouragement of prosumption within practice - oriented SHCI has hitherto been done in the context of energy [ 39 , 68 ] . In contrast to energy , food is a tangible object that brings people in their daily practice into a more intimate interaction and with important realms of sustainability , like seeding and caring or growth , diversity , and per - ishability . SHCI plays a crucial role in understanding and nurturing these complex networks of practices [ 48 ] in order to support a “deep change” towards sustainability . Discussing sustainability within SHCI , Knowles et al . conclude that “ [ t ] he kinds of SHCI activities that seem to meaningfully contribute toward sustainability are not those that solve well - defined problems , but rather those that contribute more subtly to a shift in culture or power” [ 54 ] . Even if we do not necessarily know what kind of design supports a change toward sustainability in this respect [ 41 ] , “it does at least mean that we are looking in the right place for inspiration to strike” [ 54 ] . Food is inherently involved in important economic , ecological , and social processes , while food sharing plays a key role in fostering social relationships and practices . We take the view that a fruitful avenue for examining what the “right place” might look like involves paying attention to ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . 80 : 22 P . Engelbutzeder et al . the synergistic interrelationships that represent less of a food cycle than a network of practices [ 46 , 48 , 58 ] in order to understand and support prosumption . In connection to food sustainability , this ultimately means encouraging food resource sharing in a way that everyone can eat enough good food every day , and sustainability means encouraging food resource sharing practices in such a way that meaningful relationships with other people ( social ) , the distribution of work and things ( economic ) , and nature ( ecological ) can thrive [ 112 ] . Svenfelt and Zapico , in a similar vein , argue that research for ICT that promotes sustainable food systems needs a holistic approach [ 103 ] . This can be found by investigating food resource sharing practices . Food resource sharing of abundant “material and competences” , based on our study , is a dis - persed practice [ 32 , 111 ] that can be seen as an important food related practice , as in growing , harvesting , processing , storing , cooking , and recycling . In growing and harvesting , for example , seeds or sprouts are shared in a digital and physical space in which people can share experiences and expertise . Ganglbauer et al . stretch the design space for food waste to also include other re - lated practices : “Designing interventions requires a consideration of the complex nexus of inter - connected practices ( dispersed and integrated ) that define food practices” [ 32 ] . Our work demon - strates that such interconnected practices themselves grow organically ( see , e . g . , 5 . 2 Networking Effects and 5 . 4 A local community striving towards abundance ) . The original—and fairly narrowly defined—purposes of our small project actually had a burgeoning effect on a wider set of sharing , building , and cooperative practices . 6 . 3 Aiming for a “Glocal” Impact Small , localized efforts support and facilitate change toward sustainable practices . Grassroots movements pay attention to local needs and shape the immediate contexts of daily life by invit - ing others to contribute to the space that they have thereby opened up [ 37 , 99 , 112 ] . While the contributions are local , they also contribute progressively to a global effort [ 34 ] and thereby ulti - mately create scalable lessons for design in the joint sphere of local and global impacts towards sustainability . In considering the global challenges to food production , the current dialogue focuses on en - suring that there is enough food available on the supply side to feed a growing population [ 104 ] as well as on placing these economic increases on an environmental and social level , particularly in the context of sustainability and climate change [ 80 , 85 ] . As pointed out , global attention to the issue of food waste is increasing , and strategies for avoiding it are being discussed [ 79 ] . The consideration of these global challenges , which affect people acutely in different economic , eco - logical , and social ways , is of particular importance and has already led to several socio - technical innovations in connection to grassroots movements [ 99 , 105 ] . Still , according to Svenfeld and Zapico , ICT for sustainability focuses on “increasing resource efficiency and [ . . . ] transparency and traceability” [ 103 ] . However , improvements in coordination , infrastructure , or policy at a global level cannot alone support complex food practices in their local execution . “Deep change” toward more sustainability requires both a global and a local level of attention [ 112 ] . For small , local grassroots initiatives and projects striving for sustainability , the question of their potential global impact and—within that—the role of ICT arises . By “glocal” , we mean com - bining local with global characteristics , as in thinking globally and acting locally [ 30 ] . Weber et al . state that within alternative food movements lies the “idea of a global network of local or regional initiatives to change the whole food system , to seed new local communities” [ 112 ] . In our case , through Author One and Foodroots Community , there has been a close relationship with differ - ent actors of the grassroots movement of Foodsharing ( foodsharing . de ) , which is active in over 369 districts / cities , mostly in German - speaking countries . The organizations of the districts / cities ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . From Surplus and Scarcity toward Abundance 80 : 23 are independent from one another but share the platform and certain rules and values , which are documented in a wiki . The Chili Project is a pilot project that has been introduced to other Foodsharing districts / cities in order to support its diffusion . Within both foodsharing . de and the Telegram group system , the respective ICT ( foodsharing . de and Telegram messenger ) could potentially compete with one an - other , but a tendency toward the increased use of instant - messaging providers for information , coordination , and organization within the Foodsharing community can be observed . Certain chat groups co - exist on foodsharing . de and Telegram . The chat functions for members of foodshar - ing . de in some cities remain rather unused in our experience , whereas Telegram use has been expanding . Much of what is needed can be facilitated without recourse to large multi - functional platforms , which deter many users . Knowles et al . argue that if a mass movement is needed for “deep change” , we need to explore “the role of technology in revitalizing civic participation” [ 54 ] . Our small project begins to demonstrate how this can be done . We saw above that users leave platforms unused— including linked applications , like a Pad—or neglect them over time . In addition , our participants viewed their contribution to Foodroots Community or the Chili Project as voluntary and part of their free time , and as a consequence , they did not want to have to deal with the use and appro - priation of new ICTs but wanted to operate in a familiar digital environment . Ganglbauer et al . discussed the potential of different ICT resources to empower “people to mo - bilize and to act as a ‘global - issue - based’ community” on the one hand and to support “people to form a local community of practical action” on the other hand , thereby fostering the rise of “a community that engaged in intertwined ‘global’ thinking and local acting” [ 34 ] . Our experience suggests that in a non - hierarchical community of volunteers , this may well be the case . However , it is up for further debate and research whether instant messaging—or Telegram , in particular—can support the emergence of a mass movement toward “deep changes” in our daily ( food resource sharing ) practices . Telegram groups were a simple solution that proved to have wider network effects and supported “sustaining , growing , and spreading” [ 11 ] . Light and Miskelly argue that in local sharing communities , “relational assets” emerge from a “sharing culture” ( sharing practices ) that can support “an ecology of mutually - supportive systems in a place” [ 61 , 62 ] . Relational assets encourage solidarity and increase the likelihood of the suc - cess of further initiatives . The kind of “meshing” that Light and Miskelly suggest might ultimately provide “the conditions for socio - technical infrastructures of sharing” [ 62 ] . Within these infras - tructures , “adding technology to sharing initiatives is only indicative of ways that networks can be deployed to be supportive of local context , evolving cultures , and collective agency . The tools are ad - hoc and responsive , like the relations being formed” [ 62 ] . It remains to be seen , however , whether such ambitions are easily realized , especially regarding the meshing opportunities of the foodsharing . de platform and Telegram groups . Biørn – Hansen and Håkansson have described the role of ICT in supporting community orga - nizations with scaling up . This means supporting “activities that try to identify and move towards a scale beyond individually targeted interventions , where a larger impact can enable more peo - ple to take part” rather than “reaching a larger geographical area” [ 11 ] . However , for these kinds of organizations , it is difficult to translate the excitement for socio - technical artifacts into action . Most often , the community organizations are hampered by “limited financial resources and a lack of ‘in - house’ expertise in the design and development and maintenance of digital systems” . Nevertheless , a striking feature of small , local endeavors is that they do not require sophis - ticated technological support to form a community of interest and to let sustainable practice flourish . Our own investigations demonstrated that overly complex functionalities and multiple applications acted as something of a deterrent to local engagement . Participants gravitated toward ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . 80 : 24 P . Engelbutzeder et al . a lightweight solution in Telegram , where they sought advice from people in their locality rather than from external links to information . This is not to downplay the role of communications tech - nology . Our experience is that there has been a small but visible organic growth in our community of interest that is sustained by communication media , which provide a variety of knowledge - and expertise resources and support food resource sharing . The implication , in design terms , is that any proposed application must be simple enough that a variety of people can use it with minimal overhead while being sophisticated enough that users can move in and out of groups with distinct but related interests . Our data demonstrate that a simple project with chili plants can generate interests that move beyond these plants—interests in community gardening , in the sharing of other plant materials , in the desire to be better educated about some matters and in support for the evident pride that people take in their progress ( all supported by the Telegram group of the Chili Project and the other Telegram groups of Foodroots Community ) . Nevertheless , we should note that a more sophisticated ICT policy for grassroots movements might become more necessary over time as tasks and activities increase and membership grows . Here , we come to the question of scale , and this , we feel , is where design opportunities abound , because “ [ w ] hen grassroots initiatives attempt to scale beyond the level of a very basic technological platform , the pre - existing trust and social capital benefiting from their local focus might not be sufficient” [ 106 ] . How can we design support systems that scale in such a way that communities can grow towards abundance and spread new seeds for further communities to emerge ? Here , scale is more than the aggregation of individual contribution and instead lies in the nourishment of a “sharing culture” [ 61 ] that offers ways for people to take part by making a contribution [ 11 ] and make their contribution count on a glocal level . Resonating with Rossitto et al . [ 92 ] we do not believe that this lies in measuring mem - bers’ interaction with digital platforms or providing administrators with the means to quantify individual contributions , because “designs that quantify care , and classify membership status [ are considered ] as ways that can introduce external motivations , and promote competition and indi - vidualism instead of mutual care and well - being” [ 92 ] . In terms of design , it is necessary to support “complementary social and participatory processes” in addition to technical infrastructures [ 86 ] . We demonstrated above that there is a clear need for local spaces ( like community gardens ) as well as local expertise sharing , and that this sharing will magnify as and when opportunities for food “prosumption” also increase . The retention of a local element , however , seems crucial . Answer Garden [ 1 , 2 , 81 ] is by now a well - known approach to the problem of questions and answers of varying complexity and , to us , points the way towards the maintenance of local contact . Systems like Answer Garden can be designed to provide brief answers to questions , which allows them to be used at a local level , where human expertise in response to more complex enquiries is required . 7 CONCLUSION We argued above , based on a small - scale study of food resource sharing practices , that there is a need to broaden HFI beyond a concern for food waste management ( surplus ) and towards the po - tential of abundance . A design for food resource sharing that is aligned with surplus can transcend existing practices of waste and dependency . For the future design of sustainable food systems , it is important that design act as a catalyst for deeper food resource sharing by sharing local resources that are abundant ( like the chili plants in our project ) or , as in the case of Disco Soup [ 105 ] , in which food that would otherwise be thrown away is used to open up a space in which people can meet to cook , chat , and share . The abundance framework encompasses the thriving of a local food community that is nourished by sharing food resources , which , in turn , evokes the sharing of more food resources . In promoting this approach , we point to a number of advantages . These include active commu - nity involvement rather than a provider – beneficiary relationship , the development of skills and ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 5 , Article 80 . Publication date : September 2023 . From Surplus and Scarcity toward Abundance 80 : 25 expertise that would otherwise not exist , and the potential over time to provide alternatives to orthodox conceptions of global supply chains and the economic orthodoxies that underpin them . We argued that , at a purely local level , ICT has relevance but that simple solutions are adequate and “just enough” to support a community’s growth towards abundance . It is important , at this level , to set the barriers for engaging in the ICT infrastructure and the physical sphere as low as possible . Telegram ( instant messenger ) proves to offer good support in that regard . Nevertheless , there were clear indications in our work of a desire to move beyond the single fo - cus provided by adopting chili plants . Based on the research of Ganglbauer et al . on the grassroots movement of Foodsharing , we discussed the potential of a community project to become “glocal” ( by supporting local actions within global thinking ) [ 34 ] . Gradual expansion towards a “glocal” ap - proach will require more sophisticated solutions , which we see as being situated within hybrid sys - tems . Our research suggests that care and support for others in order to enable them to make their contribution is a key element in designing for abundance in food systems . Within abundance—and within the “just enough” commitment—lies the community , which shares its abundant resources with its members and which promotes the non - rivalrous approach of “the more I share with you , the more will ultimately be shared with others” . In order to enable people to contribute to the community and to thus free themselves from their dependencies both on others and on the food system ( e . g . , by distributing surplus in the mode of “food sharing for charity”—i . e . , food for the “outside” , or by encouraging those being cared for and who do not have tasks within the community in the investigated retirement home to make a contribution ) , a small level of support from the ranks of the community can be sufficient . In the retirement home , the assisted individuals contributed with their practical knowledge to the flourishing of a newly founded garden . Small assistance in using ICT brought two participants to the community to share their knowledge . The aim here is to reduce dependencies and strengthen interdependence . This interdependence is nourished by small local contributions . Here , for ICT , the challenge is to make these contributions count on a “glocal” level . In regard to the grassroots project on which our study focused , ICT of a relatively simple kind was sufficient to make food resource sharing a viable practice . Our findings revealed that the Telegram group facilitated and encouraged food resource sharing practices on a wider scale than originally envisaged , thereby nurturing a “sharing culture” [ 61 ] . Telegram offers a low - threshold entry into the organization of grassroots movements and thus allows people to find their first entry point into projects and the community at their own pace . The investigation into food resource sharing practices promises to be a fruitful field for SHCI scholars both in understanding and supporting “deep changes” towards sustainability . Food shar - ing has played and still plays an important role in fostering ecological , economic , and social aspects in the development of human civilization [ 23 , 52 ] . Developing a more holistic view towards sharing practices in SHCI , we argue , requires us to engage with the complexity of networks of ( inherently social ) practices that are oriented towards food as a resource and that can be both produced as well as consumed at the local level in order that “glocal” abundance might ultimately be achieved ( see Figure 3 ) . In future research , we will further explore how ICT can help the project to thrive and scale up , and especially how to understand how the diffusion of the project in many other Foodsharing cities / districts succeeds . In doing so , we will focus on how ICT can support abundant local food production whilst continuing to attend to the issue of the distribution of such resources . Food is only abundant if it gets to the people who need it . “Scaling up” will change communities’ ICT needs and practices . Furthermore , we will investigate how food resource sharing effects—and especially enables—new forms of food sharing that are oriented towards “sharing for community” and take place both online and offline .
