Monica David , Hospital Santa Maria , Lleida , Spain . Axon morphogenesis is a complex process regulated by a variety of secreted molecules , including morphogens and growth factors , resulting in the establishment of the neuronal circuitry . Our previous work demonstrated that growth factors [ Neurotrophins ( NT ) and Hepatocyte Growth Factor ( HGF ) ] signal through β - catenin during axon morphogenesis . HGF signaling promotes axon outgrowth and branching by inducing β - catenin phosphorylation at Y142 and transcriptional regulation of T - Cell Factor ( TCF ) target genes . Here , we asked which genes are regulated by HGF signaling during axon morphogenesis . An array screening indicated that HGF signaling elevates the expression of chemokines of the CC and CXC families . In line with this , CCL7 , CCL20 , and CXCL2 signiﬁcantly increase axon outgrowth in hippocampal neurons . Experiments using blocking antibodies and chemokine receptor antagonists demonstrate that chemokines act downstream of HGF signaling during axon morphogenesis . In addition , qPCR data demonstrates that CXCL2 and CCL5 expression is stimulated by HGF through Met / b - catenin / TCF pathway . These results identify CC family members and CXCL2 chemokines as novel regulators of axon morphogenesis downstream of HGF signaling . Keywords : beta - catenin , axon , neurite outgrowth , chemokine , hippocampal neurons , hepatocyte growth factor INTRODUCTION The establishment of the neuronal morphogenesis is a com - plex process by which neurons extend and branch out an axon and dendrites , resulting in the proper assembly of the neuronal circuitry . A range of secreted molecules , including growth fac - tors and morphogens , promote axonal , and dendrite outgrowth . Among them , the Neurotrophins ( NT ) , Hepatocyte Growth Factor ( HGF ) , and Wnts regulate neuronal survival , neurite outgrowth , synaptogenesis , and synaptic plasticity ( Maina and Klein , 1999 ; Korhonen et al . , 2000 ; Chao , 2003 ; Yu and Malenka , 2003 ; Ciani and Salinas , 2005 ; Nakano et al . , 2007 ; Park and Shen , 2012 ) . HGF signaling through its tyrosine kinase recep - tor Met provides neurotrophic signals to hippocampal neurons ( Korhonen et al . , 2000 ) and promotes axon outgrowth ( David et al . , 2008 ) . How neurons interpret this variety of signals to develop unique axon arbor morphologies is just beginning to be understood . β - catenin , a component of the cell – cell adhesion complex and an effector of canonical Wnt signaling , plays a key role in axon outgrowth , dendritogenesis , and synapse formation ( Murase et al . , 2002 ; Bamji et al . , 2003 , 2006 ; Yu and Malenka , 2003 ; Lu et al . , 2004 ) . Brieﬂy , canonical Wnt signaling results in the cytosolic stabilization of β - catenin , which in the absence of Wnt is degraded through the ubiquitin - proteasome system ( Li et al . , 2012 ) . Stabilized β - catenin translocates to the nucleus and together with Lymphoid Enhancer Factor - 1 ( LEF - 1 ) / T - cell factor ( TCF ) transcription factors regulates the expression of Wnt target genes ( Behrens et al . , 1996 ; Molenaar et al . , 1996 ) . On the other hand , β - catenin binding to the adhesion complex components cadherin and α - catenin is altered by β - catenin tyrosine phospho - rylation , resulting in the downregulation of cell adhesion and the promotion of migration ( Nelson and Nusse , 2004 ; Heuberger and Birchmeier , 2010 ) . We previously showed a requirement for β - catenin phosphorylation at Y654 and Y142 in the axon outgrowth promoted by the NT and HGF signaling , respec - tively . HGF signaling induces the phosphorylation of β - catenin at Y142 ( PY142 ) , which translocates to the nucleus and pro - motes axon morphogenesis through TCF4 / β - catenin - dependent transcription of target genes ( David et al . , 2008 ) . These ﬁndings highlight the relevance of β - catenin forms producing transcrip - tional regulation independent of Wnt signaling ( Monga et al . , 2002 ; Zeng et al . , 2006 ; Heuberger and Birchmeier , 2010 ; Xi et al . , 2012 ) . Chemotactic cytokines ( “chemokines” ) are small proteins clas - siﬁed into four subgroups referred to as CXC / α , CC / β , CX 3 C / δ , or C / δ families ( Zlotnik and Yoshie , 2000 ; Tran and Miller , 2003 ) according to the position and spacing of cysteine residues impor - tant for their tri - dimensional structure . Chemokines are best known for their role in leukocyte migration in host immune surveillance and inﬂammatory responses . However , chemokines and their G - protein - coupled receptors are also expressed by neu - rons and glia in the nervous system . Interestingly , chemokines of the CXC and CC families have been implicated in proliferation , neurogenesis , and neuronal differentiation of neural precursors Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience www . frontiersin . org April 2013 | Volume 7 | Article 52 | 1 CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE Bhardwaj et al . Chemokines induce axon outgrowth ( Tran and Miller , 2003 ; Edman et al . , 2008a , b ; Wu et al . , 2009 ) . Meningeal CXCl12 / Sdf - 1 signaling through its receptor CXCR4 regulates the migration of cerebellar progenitors ( Zou et al . , 1998 ; Reiss et al . , 2002 ) and Cajal - Retzius cells ( Borrell and Marin , 2006 ) . CXCL12 also controls interneuron migration during corti - cal development ( Stumm et al . , 2003 ; Lopez - Bendito et al . , 2008 ; Lysko et al . , 2011 ; Sanchez - Alcaniz et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , CXCL12 reduces axon outgrowth and branching in hippocampal neurons ( Pujol et al . , 2005 ) . Importantly , neu - ronal migration and morphogenesis are coordinated processes that appear inversely regulated by CXCL12 signaling . CXCL12 increases the rate of interneuron migration while reducing neurite branching , whereas blocking CXCL12 signaling enhances neu - rite branching , thus explaining how interneurons switch from migratory streams to invade the cortical plate and branch out extensively ( Lysko et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , astrocyte - secreted CCL5 / Rantes induces the outgrowth of cortical neuron neurites ( Chou et al . , 2008 ) . CCL5 secretion is suppressed in astrocytes from a Huntington mouse model ( Chou et al . , 2008 ) , indicating that chemokine signaling is involved in neuronal physiology and pathology . Here we asked which are the genes regulated by HGF / β - catenin signaling during axon morphogenesis . We observe that expression of CC and CXC chemokines is upregulated by HGF signaling in hippocampal neurons . We ﬁnd that chemokines promote axon outgrowth in hippocampal neurons , the most remarkable one being CXCL2 that also stimulates axon branch - ing . Experiments using chemokine blocking antibodies and phar - macological inhibitors of chemokine receptors demonstrate that chemokines act downstream of HGF signaling . We also show that chemokine expression is reduced upon Met and TCF inhi - bition . These results identify the chemokines as novel regulators of axon morphogenesis downstream of HGF and β - catenin / TCF signaling . MATERIALS AND METHODS MATERIALS HGF was purchased from Peprotech , Wnt - 3a from Millipore , Hoescht - 33258 , SU11274 , and FH535 were from Sigma , and SB225502 and SB324837 from Tocris . Antibodies were purchased from the following companies : β III - tubulin from Covance , β - actin from Sigma , β - catenin from Becton - Dickinson and anti - rat CCL20 and CXCL2 antibodies from R & D . Rat CCL5 , CCL7 , CCL20 were from R & D Systems and CXCL2 from Peprotech . HIPPOCAMPAL CULTURES Rat primary hippocampal neurons were isolated from 18 – 19 day embryos and cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with N2 and B27 . Neurons were plated on poly - D - lysine coated ( 500 μ g / ml ) glass coverslips for immunostaining ( 40 cells / mm 2 ) or on plastic ( 1000 – 1500 cells / mm 2 ) for RNA isolation . IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE AND AXON MEASUREMENTS Neurons plated on coverslips were treated at the ﬁrst day in vitro ( 1DIV ) and ﬁxed at 2DIV . Treatments were as follows : 10 , 300 , or 1000 ng / ml for chemokines ; HGF 50 ng / ml ; Wnt - 3a 100 ng / ml ; SU11274 2 μ M ; FH535 10 μ M ; SB225502 1 . 25 nM ; SB324837 20 nM ; blocking antibodies against rat CCL20 and CXCL2 ( 40 μ g / ml ) or ovalbumin at the same concentration . Neurons were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 20 min at RT . Cells were then washed with phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) and blocked and permeabilized in PBS containing 5 % Foetal calf serum , 5 % Horse serum , 0 . 2 % glycine , and 0 . 1 % Triton X100 , before incubation with β III - tubulin antibody . Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor488 or Fluor594 ( Molecular Probes ) . Coverslips were mounted on Mowiol . Micrographs were obtained using an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope ( 10 × , 0 . 3 NA , or 20 × , 0 . 4 NA ) equipped with epiﬂuorescence optics and a camera ( Olympus OM - 4 Ti ) . Images were acquired using DPM Manager Software and processed using MacBiophotonics ImageJ software ( www . macbiophotonics . ca ) . Axon length was measured using Adobe Photoshop software and the axon was identiﬁed as the longest neurite at this stage ( 2 DIV ) of the hippocampal cell development . Images were inverted using Photoshop and are shown on a white background for a clearer visualization of their morphology . Branching was measured by counting Total Axonal Branch Tip Number ( TABTN ) ( Yu and Malenka , 2003 ) . Typically , 15 – 20 neurons were measured / condition in ≥ three indepen - dent experiments . Axon length and branching plots represent values compared to the corresponding untreated control , shown as average ± s . e . m . Signiﬁcance was calculated by the Student’s t - test . Asterisk ( ∗ ) indicates statistical signiﬁcance compared to the corresponding untreated control and hash ( # ) compared to stimulated controls ( see legends for details ) . LUCIFERASE ASSAY To determine β - catenin transcriptional activation status , luciferase assay was performed following transfection of the TOP - Flash plasmid that carries a synthetic promoter containing three copies of the TCF - 4 binding site upstream of a ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter gene . Hek293T cells were plated at a density of 100 cells / mm 2 and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies ) on the day next after plating . Treatments were given on the following day for 24 h ( HGF 50 ng / ml ; Wnt - 3a 100 ng / ml ; FH535 8 μ M and SU11274 2 μ M ) . After 48 h of transfection , cells were lysed in lysis buffer 25 mM glycylglycine , pH 7 . 8 , 15 mM Mg 2 SO4 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 5 mM EGTA and rocket on ice for 15 min . Luciferase activity in the cell lysates was determined in Luciferase Buffer ( 25 mM glycylglycine , 15 mM KHPO 4 , pH 7 , 8 , 15 mM Mg 2 SO 4 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 2 mM ATP , 100 mM acetyl - coenzymeA , and 100 mM luciferine ) using a microplate luminometer . Luciferase activity was normalized for the total protein concentration in each condition . shRNA EXPRESSION BY LENTIVIRAL INFECTION shRNA vectors speciﬁc for rat β - catenin were transfected into Hek293T cells together with the plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2G , as previously described ( David et al . , 2008 ) . The Hek293T medium was collected after 48 h of transfection and centrifuged at 50 , 000 × g for 3 h . The viral pellet was re - suspended in ster - ile PBS plus 2 % Bovine Serum Albumin . Hippocampal neurons were transduced 3 – 4 h after plating . According to GFP expression driven by the lentiviral vector ∼ 90 % of neurons were transduced .

Chemokines induce axon outgrowth Neurons were treated with HGF alone or together with pharma - cological inhibitors at 3 DIV and collected at 4 DIV for mRNA puriﬁcation ( RNA isolation kit ; Macherey - Nagel ) . Efﬁciency of the silencing induced by shRNA was evaluated by Western - blotting of 4DIV hippocampal neuron cell lysates . Densitometric analysis of the bands was performed using Scion software and β - catenin levels were normalized to the intensity of β - actin band . RNA ISOLATION For RNA isolation , treatments were performed as for immunoﬂu - orescence studies . Pervanadate was applied for the last 2 h of HGF stimulation . RNA was isolated using Nucleospin RNA II kit ( Macherey - Nagel ) , including a DNase digestion step to remove contaminant DNA . ARRAY PROCESSING AND ARRAY DATA ANALYSIS RNA samples ( 800 ng ) were ampliﬁed and labeled with Cy3 - CTP using the One - Color Microarray - Based Gene Expression Analysis Protocol ( Agilent Technologies , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) and hybridized to Whole Rat Genome Microarray 4 × 44K ( G4131F , Agilent Technologies ) . Raw data ﬁles from the scanned arrays were extracted using Feature Extraction software version 9 ( Agilent Technologies ) . Data ﬁles from Feature Extraction software were imported into GeneSpring® GX software version 9 . 0 . ( Agilent Technologies ) . Quantile normalization was performed ( Bolstad et al . , 2003 ) and expression values ( log2 transformed ) were obtained for each probe . Probes were also ﬂagged ( Present , Marginal , Absent ) using GeneSpring® default settings . Probes with signal values above the lower percentile ( 20th ) and ﬂagged as Present or Marginal in 100 % of replicates in at least one out of the two conditions under study , were selected for further analysis . Paired t - test was performed between conditions to be tested for differential expres - sion analysis . Raw p - values were corrected for false discovery rate control using Benjamini – Hochsberg’s method ( Benjamini and Hochberg , 1995 ) . REVERSE - TRANSCRIPTASE PCR mRNA was reverse - transcribed ( RT ) to cDNA ( 25 ◦ C for 10 min , 42 ◦ C for 60 min , and 95 ◦ C for 5 min ) using random hexam - ers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase ( Applied Biosystems ) . Negative control RT - minus reactions were carried out to conﬁrm absence of DNA contamination in RNA . SEMI - QUANTITATIVE PCR To detect the relative expression of different chemokine genes in HGF - treated and untreated samples , semi - quantitative ( sq ) PCR was run . Equal volumes of cDNA were ampliﬁed by PCR using a couple of speciﬁc primers expanding at least two exons within the gene of interest . Sequences of the primers used were : CCL5 forward atatggctcggacaccactc , CCL5 reverse cccacttcttctctgggttg , CCL7 forward gggaccaattcatccacttg , CCL7 reverse cctcctcaacccacttctga , CCL20 forward gcttacctct - gcagccagtc , CCL20 reverse cggatcttttcgacttcagg , CXCL2 forward agggtacaggggttgttgtg , CXCL2 reverse tttggacgatcctctgaacc . Ten microlitre aliquots taken from 25 , 30 , and 35 PCR cycles ( CXCL2 and CCL7 ) , 30 , 34 , and 38 PCR cycles ( CCL5 ) or 24 and 28 PCR cycles ( CCL20 ) were analyzed in 3 % agarose gel . Densitometry of the DNA bands was performed using the Scion Image software ( Scion Corporation ) and comparing measurements from non - saturated PCR products . Loading was checked by ampliﬁcation of the GAPDH transcript . Transcript analysis was performed from at least three independent simples . REAL TIME PCR ( qPCR ) cDNA processed from 1 μ g RNA was used as the template . One microlitre aliquot of each cDNA was used per well . Samples were run in triplicate . Expression of the transcript levels were analysed using a FAM - labeled CXCL2 or CCL5 probes and com - pared to that of GAPDH , used as a loading control , in a ABI Prism 7000 HT sequence detection system ( Applied Biosystems ) . Relative expression was calculated using the (cid:2)(cid:2) C1 method .

Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience www . frontiersin . org April 2013 | Volume 7 | Article 52 | 3 Bhardwaj et al . Chemokines induce axon outgrowth during hippocampal neuron development ( David et al . , 2008 ) . We questioned which are the genes regulated upon HGF stimu - lation in axon morphogenesis . We performed array experiments using control and HGF - treated hippocampal neuron samples . Array results revealed an upregulation of several chemokine genes in HGF - treated neurons compared to untreated neurons ( Figure 1A ) , which was conﬁrmed by sqRT - PCR ( Figures 1A , B ) . In silico analysis of the 2 kb region upstream of the ATG in the identiﬁed chemokine genes showed the presence of sev - eral copies of putative TCF - binding sites , as predicted for β - catenin / TCF - target genes ( data not shown ) . These ﬁndings indicated that chemokines may be involved in the HGF - induced axon morphogenesis . CHEMOKINE SIGNALING PROMOTES AXON MORPHOGENESIS To address this possibility , we ﬁrst tested whether chemokines induce axon outgrowth and branching . Hippocampal neurons were treated with CCL5 , CCL7 , CCL20 , or CXCL2 at differ - ent concentrations ( 10 – 1000 ng / ml ) . CCL5 ( 10 ng / ml ) , CXCL2 ( 300 and 1000 ng / ml ) , and CCL20 ( 10 and 1000 ng / ml ) sig - niﬁcantly increased the total length of the axon compared to axon length values of untreated neurons ( Figure 2 ) . A cocktail of all the chemokines ( 10 ng / ml ) also increased axon outgrowth ( Figure 2I ) . The increases in axon length were in the range of that obtained by HGF stimulation ( Figure 2I ) . In addition to increasing axon length , CXCL2 also produced axon branch - ing ( Figure 2J ) . Axon branching was not signiﬁcant for the other studied chemokines at the tested concentrations ( data not shown ) . Having showed that exogenously added chemokines induce axon morphogenesis in hippocampal neurons , we studied whether blocking chemokine signaling would inhibit the effect of HGF on axon morphogenesis . To this end , we used blocking anti - bodies against the chemokines as well as the chemokine receptor antagonists SB2250002 and SB328437 ( White et al . , 1998 , 2000 ) . Neurons incubated with HGF together with antibodies against rat CXCL2 or CCL20 ( 40 μ g / ml ) displayed axon length and branching values similar to those of untreated neurons ( Figure 3 ) . However , the increase in axon length promoted by HGF was not affected by the presence of ovalbumin at the same concentra - tion than the antibodies ( 40 μ g / ml ) . Furthermore , treatment with HGF and the antagonist for the receptor of CXCL2 ( CXCR2 ) FIGURE 2 | Recombinant chemokines increase axon morphogenesis .

SB2250002 , or with SB328437 , an antagonist of CCR3 ( that acts as the only receptor of CCL20 and one of the receptors of CCL5 ) , potently inhibited axon outgrowth and branching to values below those of control neurons ( Figure 3 ) . These results suggest that CXCL2 and CCL20 are secreted upon HGF stimulation and that endogenous CXCL2 and CCL20 signaling plays a role in axon morphogenesis . HGF REGULATES CXCL2 EXPRESSION THROUGH MET AND β - CATENIN / TCF We sought to study the pathway regulating chemokine expres - sion downstream of HGF signaling . We demonstrated that HGF stimulation induces PY142 β - catenin phoshorylation and tran - scriptional regulation by TCF / β - catenin ( David et al . , 2008 ) . To check if chemokine expression is controlled by TCF and β - catenin downstream of HGF signaling , we followed both a pharmacological and a gene silencing approach . We used SU11274 that inhibits Met activity ( Berthou et al . , 2004 ) and FH535 , which inhibits TCF / β - catenin by blocking the recruit - ment of β - catenin to the promoter of target genes ( Handeli and Simon , 2008 ) . First , we studied β - catenin transcriptional activation using the TOP reporter plasmid in Hek293 cells , in which HGF / Met signaling is active ( Royal and Park , 1995 ) . Although HGF did not stimulate luciferase reporter activity vs . control , treatment with SU11274 signiﬁcantly reduced β - catenin transcriptional activation ( Figure 4B ) . This result sug - gests that in Hek293 cells , HGF / Met signaling through β - catenin is already active in basal conditions , likely by an autocrine production of HGF . Furthermore , treatment with FH535 sig - niﬁcantly reduced luciferase activity , demonstrating that TCF activation is involved in HGF / Met signaling ( Figure 4B ) . We used Wnt - 3a as a positive control , which produced a clear acti - vation of luciferase activity and was also inhibited by FH535 ( Figure 4B ) . These results conﬁrmed FH535 as an effective TCF / β - catenin inhibitor and indicated that HGF / Met signal through TCF / β - catenin in Hek293 cells among other cell systems ( Monga et al . , 2002 ) . In hippocampal neurons , both SU11274 and FH535 inhibited the axon outgrowth induced by HGF signaling ( Figure 4A ) . As a positive control we also treated neurons with Wnt - 3a with or without FH535 . As expected , TCF inhibitor blocked the axon out - growth promoted by Wnt - 3a . FH535 treatment also blocked the axon outgrowth promoted by HGF , rendering axon length val - ues below those of control neurons , thus conﬁrming that HGF signaling is dependent on TCF - driven transcription ( David et al . , 2008 ) . Next , we investigated whether chemokine expression is reg - ulated through the HGF / Met / TCF / β - catenin pathway .

Chemokines induce axon outgrowth FIGURE 4 | Met and TCF inhibition reduce the axon outgrowth induced by HGF . ( A ) Hippocampal neurons treated with HGF ( 50ng / ml ) or Wnt - 3a ( 100ng / ml ) alone or together with FH535 ( 10 μ M ) or SU11274 ( 2 μ M ) were immunostained for β III - tubulin to reveal the axon morphology . Top pictures were taken at 10 × and bottom at 20 × . Bars = 30 μ m . ( B ) β - catenin transcriptional activity determined using the TOP reported plasmid in transfected Hek293 cells . Relative luciferase activity was determined at 48h after transfection . Treatments were applied for the last 24h ( see Materials and Methods for details ) . ∗ p ≤ 0 . 05 , ∗∗ p ≤ 0 . 01 . CXCL2 promoted both axon outgrowth and branching , we focused on this chemokine and on CCL5 as a member of the CC family . We analyzed the expression of these chemokines using real time qPCR from control neurons , neurons treated with HGF or treated with HGF together with SU11274 or FH535 . Expression of CXCL2 increased by 1 . 6 - fold in HGF - treated neu - rons compared to untreated neurons , but was reduced to values below those of untreated neurons following the treatment with HGF and SU11274 ( Figure 5A ) . Pervanadate ( a tyrosine phos - phatase inhibitor ) was previously used to stabilize the PY142 - β - catenin form ( David et al . , 2008 ) . However , HGF stimulation increased CXCL2 expression in pervanadate - treated neurons in a similar way than in the absence of pervanadate ( Figure 5B ) . Furthermore , the increase in CXCL2 expression induced by HGF signaling was lost upon the co - treatment of HGF and FH535 ( Figure 5A ) , indicating that it was mediated by TCF / β - catenin . In addition , we analyzed CXCL2 mRNA levels in hippocampal neurons in which β - catenin was silenced following lentiviral - driven shRNA expression . The silencing efﬁciency obtained with this β - catenin shRNA at four days was around 40 – 50 % as sim - ilarly reported ( David et al . , 2008 , 2010 ) . Whereas HGF was able to increase the expression of CXCL2 in neurons expressing scrambled shRNA , this increase was lost in neurons expressing β - catenin shRNA ( Figure 5C ) . We also analyzed the expression of CCL5 , which increased nearly 2 - fold upon HGF stimulation and was signiﬁcantly reduced in the presence of HGF and FH535 ( Figure 5D ) . DISCUSSION Aiming to identify the genes regulated by HGF signaling in developing hippocampal neurons during axon morphogenesis , we found the upregulation of several chemokines of the CC and CXC families . Following arrayexperiments , we demonstrated that CCL5 , CCL20 , and CXCL2 signiﬁcantly promote axon outgrowth and , in the case of CXCL2 , also axon branching . PCR data con - ﬁrmed that chemokines are upregulated by HGF signaling . By blocking chemokine signaling , we demonstrated that CCL20 and CXCL2 act downstream of HGF signaling in axon outgrowth and branching . During the establishment of the axon arbor morphology , HGF signaling induces β - catenin PY142 and TCF4 - dependent transcriptional regulation of target genes ( David et al . , 2008 ) . We inquired whether chemokines are regulated through TCF / β - catenin downstream of HGF signaling . TCF inhibition or β - catenin silencing reduced CXCL2 and CCL5 expression upon HGF stimulation . We conclude that chemokines are new molecules modulating axon outgrowth in hippocampal neurons , which expression is regulated by HGF through TCF / β - catenin signaling .

CHEMOKINE SIGNALING IN NEURONAL MIGRATION AND AXON OUTGROWTH Chemokines are well - established chemotactic molecules induc - ing the migration of leukocytes and hematopoietic progenitors ( Rossi and Zlotnik , 2000 ) . In the nervous system , chemokines and chemokine receptor expression are regulated under a vari - ety of conditions , including brain repair ( Babcock et al . , 2003 ; Miller et al . , 2008 ; Jaerve et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , chemokine signal - ing has been involved in neuroinﬂammation , the pathogenesis of chronic pain ( White et al . , 2005 ) , myelination ( Kury et al . , 2002 ) and human immunodeﬁciency virus - 1 ( HIV - 1 ) - associated neuropathology ( Tran and Miller , 2003 ) . Furthermore , a role for chemokines ( in particular for CXCL12 / Sdf - 1 ) in regulating axon outgrowth and guidance has also been described during nervous system development ( Tran and Miller , 2003 ) . CXCL12 - CXCR4 signaling is involved in the guidance of motoneuron’s axon ( Lieberam et al . , 2005 ) and downstream of Sonic Hedgehog sig - naling in retinal ganglion cell axon pathﬁnding ( Stacher Horndli and Chien , 2012 ) . CXCL12 can either produce growth cone repulsion or attraction depending on the levels of cGMP ( Xiang et al . , 2002 ) . Remarkably , CXCL12 signaling regulates the migra - tion of different neuron and neuronal progenitor populations : gonadotropin - releasing hormone - 1 neurons emerging from the nasal placode ( Casoni et al . , 2012 ) , interneurons moving from the medial ganglionic eminence toward the cortical plate ( Lopez - Bendito et al . , 2008 ; Lysko et al . , 2011 ) , cerebellar progenitors ( Zou et al . , 1998 ; Vilz et al . , 2005 ) and sensory neuron progen - itors toward dorsal root ganglia ( Belmadani et al . , 2005 ) . CCL2 , CCL7 , and their receptors are expressed during midbrain devel - opment , promoting the differentiation of dopaminergic neurons and also neuritogenesis ( Edman et al . , 2008a , b ) . To our knowl - edge , this is the ﬁrst work reporting that CC chemokines induce axon morphogenesis in hippocampal neurons . In agreement with our data , in situ hybridization data freely available online reveals the expression of chemokines in the mouse hippocampus during embryonic and adult life ( see Genepaint and Allen Brain Atlas webpages ) . CXCL12 was shown to promote the extension of per - forant ﬁbers from the entorhinal cortex to dentate gyrus neurons Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience www . frontiersin . org April 2013 | Volume 7 | Article 52 | 7 Bhardwaj et al . Chemokines induce axon outgrowth and the migration of dentate granule cells during hippocam - pal development ( Bagri et al . , 2002 ; Lu et al . , 2002 ; Ohshima et al . , 2008 ) . In addition , CXCL12 reduces axon elongation while promoting axon branching in dissociated hippocampal neurons ( Pujol et al . , 2005 ) . We found that CXCL2 increases total axon length and axon branching in hippocampal neurons , suggesting that it plays a role in vivo during hippocampal development . In line with an effect of chemokines inducing axon development , mice lacking chemokine receptors showed impairments in hip - pocampal cognitive function and synaptic plasticity ( Rogers et al . , 2011 ; Belarbi et al . , 2013 ) . HGF / β - CATENIN SIGNALING AND CHEMOKINES Our ﬁndings establish a relationship between HGF and chemokine signaling in hippocampal neurons . HGF - treated neu - rons displayed increased expression of chemokines . Antibodies against CCL20 and CXCL2 , as well as the CCR3 and CXCR2 antagonists SB22502 and SB328437 , inhibited the axon out - growth and branching promoted by HGF , implying that chemokines are downstream of HGF signaling . Moreover , treat - ment with SB22502 or SB328437 resulted in axon length and branching values clearly below those of untreated neurons , sug - gesting that endogenous chemokine production by hippocampal neurons impacts on axon development . Furthermore , affecting CCL20 signaling by anti - CCL20 antibodies or SB328437 treat - ment reduced axon branching in the presence of HGF . However , CCL20 at the tested concentrations ( 10 – 1000 ng / ml ) did not pro - mote signiﬁcant axon branching . These ﬁndings suggest that promotion or inhibition of axon branching exhibit different EC50 / IC50 values . Alternatively , CCL20 concentrations lower than tested may induce axon branching . β - catenin is a classical effector of Wnt signaling and a tran - scriptional coactivator of LEF / TCF . We and others have described the interaction between Met and β - catenin ( Monga et al . , 2002 ; Zeng et al . , 2006 ; David et al . , 2008 ) , which results in β - catenin phosphorylation at Y142 in vitro ( David et al . , 2008 ) . In hip - pocampal neurons , HGF signaling increases PY142 - β - catenin , which moves to the nucleus and regulates axonal morphogenesis through TCF4 - transcriptional activation ( David et al . , 2008 ) . Here , we conﬁrm that HGF / Met signaling supports axon out - growth through TCF / β - catenin transcriptional activity . In line with these ﬁndings , the phosphorylation of β - catenin and α - catenin downstream of tyrosine kinase receptor and / or src acti - vation is emerging as a Wnt - independent pathway that promotes β - catenin transcriptional activation and migration of cancer cells ( Ji et al . , 2009 ; Xi et al . , 2012 ) . In this work chemokines were identiﬁed as transcriptional targets of HGF in developing in hippocampal neurons . CXCL2 and CCL5 expression anal - ysis conﬁrmed that these chemokines are regulated by HGF signaling . In addition , TCF inhibition and β - catenin silencing blocked the upregulation of CXCL2 by HGF . A previous paper ( Halleskog et al . , 2011 ) described the upregulation of cytokines and chemokines—including CXCL2—by Wnt - 3a and β - catenin signaling in activated microglia . TCF inhibition also reduced the expression of CCL5 following HGF stimulation ( by ∼ 30 % com - pared to HGF - treated neurons ) , suggesting that CCL5 is at least in part regulated through TCF / β - catenin downstream of HGF signaling . It is possible that HGF signaling activates another path - way , i . e . , NFkB pathway that affects CCL5 expression ( Chou et al . , 2008 ) . In summary these ﬁndings add different chemokines to the growing list of secreted molecules that modulate axon outgrowth , and highlights new developmental roles for sig - naling molecules known to regulate immune cell biology . As chemokines play a role in post - ischemic brain repair ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) and recruiting stem cells after spinal cord injury ( Jaerve et al . , 2012 ) , it is tempting to speculate that chemokines at the injury site may serve to improve axon regeneration .
