It has been reported that EVs play essential roles in immune response , tumor pathogenesis , neurode - generative pathogenesis and pathogenic infections . 7 – 10 EVs also have the ability to serve as biomarkers , vaccine and drug carriers engineered . 11 Increasing evidence has shown that EVs secretion takes part in the pathogenesis of skin diseases , such as systemic lupus erythematosus and AD . 12 Proteomics is the characterization of proteome , invol - ving expression , structure , functions , interactions and modifications of proteins in a cell , tissue or an organism . Proteomics plays a vital role in early disease diagnosis , prognosis and the development of disease . Furthermore , it is also crucial for drug development as target molecules . 13 , 14 Although multiple sample resources are available , peripheral blood has been regarded as an ideal source due to its reproducibility of measurement and fea - sibility of access . 15 However , 99 % of serum proteins , including albumin , immunoglobulins , and complement factors , will mask some biomarker candidates when mea - sured by conventional proteomics . To break down these barriers , we focused on proteomic profiling of EVs . In a recent study , protein analysis of exosomes derived from human adipose tissue - derived mesenchymal stem cells ( ASC - exosomes ) has shown that ASC - exosomes effectively restore epidermal barrier functions in AD by facilitating the synthesis of ceramides . 16 Cho et al 17 also prompted that ASC - exosomes could be engaged in immune regulation . Hong et al 18 have revealed that EVs derived from Staphylococcus aureus could induce AD - like inflammation in the skin . Yang et al 19 supported that microbial EVs - based metagenomic markers might detect the risk of AD development . These series of studies have shown an inextricable link between EVs and the patho - physiology of AD . However , the proteomic studies of plasma - derived EVs in AD patients have not been reported . This study showed the diversity and abundance of plasma EVs collected from moderate - to - severe AD patients and healthy individuals via proteomic analysis and suggested that the candidates for uniquely or differen - tially expressed proteins in plasma EVs could be a diagnostic marker in AD . Materials and Methods Sample Collection Patients who met the following inclusion criteria were eligible : ( 1 ) patients age at least 18 years old or above with physician - diagnosed AD , ( 2 ) according to the criteria of Williams , 20 ( 3 ) having a SCORing Atopic Dermatitis ( SCORAD ) index 21 of at least 25 or higher ( moderate - to - severe ) . Exclusion criteria included patients with sus - pected or established primary immunodeficiency , patients receiving systemic corticosteroids , immunotherapeutic agents , and / or anti - infective drugs . Patients whose SCORAD score dropped below 25 ( mild AD ) were excluded . Plasma samples were obtained from 12 patients with moderate - to - severe atopic dermatitis ( AD ) ( 8 males and 4 females , SCORAD range 30 . 6 – 72 . 9 , mean 59 . 89±12 . 25 ) and 13 healthy subjects ( 7 males and 6 females ) . Each of the clinical subjects showed very severe AD symptoms causing them to visit the hospital for treatment . Healthy control ( HC ) subjects were screened through a general health examination . The experimental protocol was estab - lished , according to the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xiamen Chang Gung Hospital ( Approval number XMCGIRB2020039 ) . All patients and donors agreed to participate in this study and signed the informed consent . Isolation of EVs EVs were isolated from plasma samples by a series of ultracentrifugation ( UC ) . Phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) diluted the blood samples to decrease the viscosity . The diluted samples were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 30 min ( 4°C ) to eliminate the debris in the blood . The supernatant was removed from the new tubes , which were further centrifuged at 10 , 000 × g for 45 min ( 4°C ) . The super - natant was filtered with 0 . 45 μm syringe filter ( Millipore , USA ) and the filtered supernatant was ultra - centrifuged at 100 , 000 × g for 70 min ( 4°C ) ( Optima L - 100XP , Beckman Coulter ) . The exosome pellet was resuspended with 10 mL cold PBS and repeated the ultracentrifugation step . The final exosome pellet was resuspended with 100μL of 0 . 22μm - filtered PBS for subsequent analysis . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 2147 / CCID .

The lysate was initially reduced to 20 mM of dithiothreitol ( DTT ) ( Sigma ) at 95°C for 5 min , and subsequently alkylated in 50 mM of iodoacetamide ( IAA ) ( Sigma ) for 30 min in the dark at room temperature ( RT ) . After alkylation , the sam - ples were centrifugated at 20000 g for 10 min , the super - natant was transferred to a 10 kDa centrifugal spin filter ( Millipore ) and sequentially washed with 200 μL of 8M of urea for three times and 200μL of 50mM of ammonium bicarbonate for two times by centrifugation at 13500 g . Next , tryptic digestion was performed by adding trypsin ( Promega ) and Lys - C ( Wako ) at 1 : 50 ( enzyme / substrate , m / m ) in 150 μL of 50 mM of ammonium bicar - bonate at 37°C for 16 h . Peptides were recovered by transferring the filter to a new collection tube and spinning at 13500 g . To increase the yield of peptides , the filter was washed twice with 100μL of 50mM of ammonium bicar - bonate . Peptides were desalted by StageTips and dried by speed vacuum at 45°C . Transmission Electron Microscope ( TEM ) TEM with negative staining was used to observe the morphology of isolated exosomes . The purified exosome was diluted by two folds to 10μL and loaded onto a copper grid for 1 min and remove the excess exosome solution by filter paper carefully . The absorbed exosomes were stained with 10μL 2 % uranyl acetate for 1 min , and the excess fluid was removed with filter paper . Grids were dried for few minutes at room temperature and exosomal images were captured by TEM at 80 kV ( HT - 7700 , Hitachi High - Technologies Corporation , Japan ) . Nano - Flow Cytometry Measurement ( NFCM ) The concentration and size of serum exosomes were ana - lyzed by NFCM flow nano - Analyzer that following the man - ufacturer’s instructions ( N30E , nano - Analyzer , NanoFCM Inc . , Xiamen , China ) . 200 nm Silica Nanosphere Cocktail was used to calibrate the concentration and size . 20 μL from each sample was diluted by cold PBS ( 1 : 4 dilution ) . The 30μL diluted sample was single stained with 20 μL Fluorescein Isothiocyanate ( FITC ) Mouse Anti - Human CD9 and FITC Mouse Anti - Human CD81 antibodies ( BD Bioscience , USA ) at 37°C for 30 minutes respectively . After incubation , the mixture was washed twice with PBS and centrifuged at 110 , 000 × g for 70 min at 4°C ( CP100MX , Hitachi High - Technologies Corporation , Japan ) . The super - natant was removed , and the pellet was resuspended with 50μL cold PBS . Events were recorded for 1 minute . The concentration , size distribution and surface proteins were quantified . Western Blot Analysis According to the manufacturer’s instructions , protein con - centrations of EVs were evaluated using a Bicinchoninic Acid ( BCA ) Protein Assay Kit ( Beyotime , China ) . Bovine Serum Albumin ( BSA ) was used as the standard . Antibodies for EV markers of CD9 ( Abcam , ab92726 , 1 : 1000 ) , TSG101 ( Abcam , ab30870 , 1 : 1000 ) and Calnexin ( Abcam , ab22595 , 1 : 1000 ) were tested using Western Blotting , using anti - mouse secondary antibody ( BioLegend , 400108 , 1 : 5000 ) . 10μg protein lysate was loaded onto 10 % or 15 % sodium dodecyl sulfate polya - crylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) gels dependent on the molecular weight of target proteins . The separated proteins were transferred to a methanol - activated polyvi - nylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membrane ( Merck Millipore , USA ) . The membrane in the blocking buffer containing 5 % skim milk powder in 1x tris - buffered saline with tween 20 ( TBST ) , for one hour at room temperature and then incubated overnight with the primary antibody at 4°C . They were removing the primary antibodies by TBST three times of washing , following by another incubation with the secondary antibody for one hour at room tem - perature . Afterward , the membrane was incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) substrate ( Merck Millipore , USA ) for five minutes at room temperature , allowing for chemiluminescent signal capturing using the Chemiscope 3300 mini ( Clinx , China ) . Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS ) Analysis All MS experiments were performed on a nanoscale EASY - nLC 1200UHPLC system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) con - nected to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos equipped with a nanoelectrospray source ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Mobile phase A contained 0 . 1 % of formic acid ( v / v ) in water ; mobile phase B contained 0 . 1 % of formic acid in 80 % of acetonitrile ( ACN ) . The peptides were dissolved in 0 . 1 % of formic acid ( FA ) with 2 % of acetonitrile and sepa - rated on a reversed - phase high - performance liquid chroma - tography ( RP - HPLC ) analytical column ( 75 µm×25 cm ) Clinical , Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology 2021 : 14 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 2147 / CCID .

The Orbitrap Fusion Lumos acquired data in a data - dependent manner alternating between full - scan MS and MS2 scans . The spray voltage was set at 2 . 2 kV and the temperature of ion transfer capil - lary was 300°C . The MS spectra ( 350 – 1800m / z ) were col - lected with 120 , 000 resolution , automatic gain control ( AGC ) of 4 × 10 5 , and 50 ms maximal injection time . Selected ions were sequentially fragmented in a 3 s cycle by high collision dissociation ( HCD ) with 30 % normalized collision energy , specified isolated windows 1 . 6 m / z , 15 , 000 resolution . AGC of 5×10 4 and 40 ms maximal injection time were used . Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s . Unassigned ions or those with a charge of 1 + and > 7 + were rejected for MS / MS . Mass Spectrometry Data Analysis Raw data were processed using Proteome Discoverer ( PD , version 2 . 2 ) , and MS / MS spectra were searched against the reviewed SwissProt human proteome database . All searches were carried out with precursor mass tolerance of 20ppm , fragment mass tolerance of 0 . 02Da , oxidation ( Met ) ( + 15 . 9949Da ) and acetylation ( protein N - terminus ) ( + 42 . 0106Da ) as variable modifications , carbamidomethy - lation ( Cys ) ( + 57 . 0215Da ) as fixed modification and three trypsin missed cleavages allowed . Only peptides with at least six amino acids in length were considered . The pep - tide and protein identifications were filtered by PD to control the false discovery rate ( FDR ) < 1 % . At least one unique peptide was required for protein identification . Functional and STRING Interaction Network Analysis Gene Ontology ( GO ) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) pathway were analysed with the Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery ( DAVID version 6 . 8 ) ( https : / / david . ncifcrf . gov / ) . 22 The biological process , molecular function and cellular component were further analysed using Panther software , online version ( http : / / www . pantherdb . org / ) . Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the Student’s t - test to compare the plasma EVs proteins from patients and healthy controls . The p - value of 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . Results Demographic Characteristics of the Study Subjects A total of 25 subjects were enrolled that included 12 AD patients and 13 healthy controls . The difference in sex and age between the healthy control and patient groups was not significant ( P = 0 . 513 and P = 0 . 252 , respectively ) . Specific details are shown in Table 1 . Isolation and Characterization of EVs Plasma EVs were isolated from HC and AD that were identified using TEM , nano - flow cytometer , and Western blot analysis . The characterization of typical cup - shaped vesicles was presented by TEM in EVs from the repre - sented sample ( Figure 1A ) . A nano - flow cytometer was used to measure the size and concentration of EVs . NFCM measurement revealed that the isolated EVs were 50 – 150 nm in size with an average size of 80 . 66±1 . 45 nm and 74 . 12±0 . 63 nm in HC and AD groups , respectively ( Figure 1B ) . The EVs in the HC group were significantly larger in size compared to those in the AD group ( Figure 1B ) . After normalization , particles concentration also was determined by 5 . 79x10 9 ±0 . 78x10 9 p / mL and 7 . 61x10 9 ±3 . 65x10 9 p / mL for HC and AD , respectively . Although particle concentration of AD is higher slightly than those of HC , the two groups are non - significantly different ( Figure 1C ) . Western blotting was used to evalu - ate the purity of isolated EVs . Western blot analysis con - firmed the presence of exosomal markers , such as CD9 and TSG101 , whereas calnexin , as non - EV marker , was not detected ( Figure 1D ) . Taken together , a series of cen - trifugation processes is successful to isolate EVs with purity and the amount of EVs is higher in AD patients .

The proteo - mic analysis revealed a large number of proteins in plasma EVs from both AD and HC groups . A total of 1478 proteins in plasma EVs were found to be common proteins in AD , whereas a total of 1597 proteins in plasma EVs were found to be common proteins in HC . A total of 1459 proteins in plasma EVs overlapped in comparing HC with AD ( Figure 2 ) . The volcano plot indicated the differ - ential encapsulation of plasma EVs proteins between AD and HC ( Figure 3A ) . A total of 86 proteins in plasma EVs showed more than 2 . 5 - fold up - regulation , while a total of 225 proteins in plasma EVs showed less than 1 / 2 . 5 - fold down - regulation with a significant difference ( p < 0 . 05 ) among AD compared with HC . The heat map showed 20 up - regulation proteins and 20 down - regulation proteins with a significant difference ( p < 0 . 05 ) in AD plasma EVs ( Figure 3B and Table 2 ) .

The candidates for differ - entially expressed proteins in plasma EVs were interrogated for a broad range of biological processes , including localiza - tion , regulation of biological quality , single - multicellular organism process , cell activation , response to stimulus , and so on . In the molecular function category , most of the pro - teins appeared to participate in protein binding and structural molecular activity . Cellular component proteins were mainly localized in the extracellular membrane - bounded organelle , cytoplasm , and extracellular region . The candidates for differentially expressed proteins in plasma EVs were illustrated in the protein – protein interaction ( PPI ) network by STRING analysis . Notably , the candidates for differentially expressed proteins in plasma EVs have been described a connectivity PPI network ( Figure 5A ) relating to several KEGG pathways , including pathways in platelet acti - vation , leukocyte transendothelial migration , complement and coagulation cascades , phagosome , pathogenic Escherichia coli infection , Rap1 signaling pathway , and so on ( top 10 KEGG pathways are shown in Figure 5B ) .

In conclusion , they indi - cated that EVs are involved in the onset or development of disease and may serve as diagnostic markers or predictive tools for prognosis and treatment responses . To date , increasing evidence has indicated that EVs are associated with the pathogenesis of AD . In this study , we compared the proteomic profiles of plasma - derived EVs between AD patients and HC patients for the first time . Proteomic analysis revealed a total of 1478 proteins in plasma EVs found as common proteins in AD , whereas a total of 1597 proteins in plasma EVs were found to be common proteins in HC . From the result , a total of 19 proteins in plasma EVs from AD were the candidates for uniquely expressed proteins compared to those from HC .

Attention was paid to the aforementioned KEGG pathways . The KEGG analysis revealed that the candidates for differentially expressed proteins were involved in many pathways , including pathways in platelet activation , leu - kocyte transendothelial migration , complement and coa - gulation cascades , phagosome , and so on . Thereby , the critical role of platelet activation has become apparent in inflammatory diseases . This encapsulates and describes all the procedures that platelets undergo to provide the necessary cofactors for the clotting system . 24 As early as 2004 , Kasperska - Zaj et al 25 showed that patients with atopic eczema / dermatitis syn - drome ( AEDS ) might have enhanced blood platelet activity as expressed by β - thrombomodulin ( β - TG ) and platelet factor - 4 ( PF - 4 ) level . A previous study also reported that elevated platelet activation markers , including β - TG , PF - 4 , vascular endothelial growth fac - tor ( VEGF ) and platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) in AD patients , are correlated with concomitant allergic diseases . 26 Hilger et al 27 demonstrated that platelet acti - vation could enhance stimulation and responsiveness to Staphylococcus aureus , which is involved in AD patho - genesis . Taken together , platelet activation may contri - bute to the pathogenesis of AD . Our research showed that the proteins involved in plate - let activation , including lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2 , and fibrinogen α / β / γ chain are upregulated . Among these pro - teins , lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2 ( LCP2 ) has become a focus of our interest . LCP2 , also called SLP - 76 tyrosine phosphoprotein ( SLP76 ) , is expressed throughout the hema - topoietic compartment . 28 It is a key protein involved in TCR signaling and other hematopoietic pathways . 29 Athari 30 confirmed that targeted therapy modulating cell signaling pathways , including high - affinity IgE receptor ( Fc͛RI ) - LAT - SLP76 , can be a powerful strategy to design new drugs to treat asthma . In addition , it has been reported that SLP76 is an essential signaling component to regulate FcεRI - induced IL - 4 production in basophils , 31 while IL - 4 provided by basophils plays a regulatory role in the initia - tion of Th2 - type immune responses . 32 So SLP76 may be involved in the pathogenesis of Th2 - associated disease . However , whether it is associated with the occurrence and development of AD has yet to be established . In conclusion , proteomic analysis identified a total of 1478 common proteins in plasma EVs from AD patients from which 19 proteins were candidates for uniquely expressed proteins compared with those of HC . Additionally , GO and KEGG analyses showed a new pro - tein - SLP67 that may significantly contribute to AD pathogenesis . Figure 4 GO analysis of the candidates for differentially expressed proteins in plasma EVs from AD . The candidates for differentially expressed proteins in plasma EVs from AD were analysed using Panther software and categorised according to biological process ( A ) , molecular function ( B ) , cellular component ( C ) . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 2147 / CCID .

Funding This work was supported by grants from the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province ( No 2020J0142 ) , Figure 5 PPI network and KEGG pathway analysis . The PPI network was analysed by STRING software to evaluate the candidates for differentially expressed proteins in plasma EVs from AD ( A ) . The molecular relationships are indicated by solid lines with or without arrow ( Inhibitory / activating relations are indicated by green / red color , respectively ) . The gray or blue dotted lines represent GO pathway or KEEG pathway , respectively . The shape of square or circle separately stands for GO / KEGG term or protein / gene . Color set point is described in the left panel . The candidates for differentially expressed proteins in plasma EVs from AD were analysed using KEGG software , and the top 10 KEGG pathways were demonstrated in the bubble map ( B ) . The node size reflects the number of gene . Color set point is described in the right panel . Clinical , Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology 2021 : 14 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 2147 / CCID .
