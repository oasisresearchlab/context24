Experiment and theory have shown that protein - induced lipid bilayer thickness deformations can yield energetically favorable bilayer - mediated interactions between integral membrane proteins , and large - scale organization of integral membrane proteins into protein clusters in cell membranes . Within the continuum elasticity theory of membranes , the energy cost of protein - induced bilayer thickness deformations can be captured by considering compression and expansion of the bilayer hydrophobic core , membrane tension , and bilayer bending , resulting in biharmonic equilibrium equations describing the shape of lipid bilay - ers for a given set of bilayer - protein boundary conditions . Here we develop a combined analytic and numerical methodology for the solution of the equilibrium elastic equations associated with protein - induced lipid bilayer deformations . Our methodology allows accurate prediction of thickness - mediated protein interactions for arbitrary protein symmetries at arbitrary protein separations and relative orientations . We provide exact analytic solutions for cylindrical integral membrane proteins with constant and varying hydrophobic thickness , and develop perturbative analytic solutions for non - cylindrical protein shapes . We complement these analytic solutions , and assess their accuracy , by developing both ﬁnite element and ﬁnite diﬀerence numerical solution schemes . We provide error estimates of our numerical solution schemes and systematically assess their convergence properties . Taken together , the work presented here puts into place an analytic and numerical framework which allows calculation of bilayer - mediated elastic interactions between integral membrane proteins for the complicated protein shapes suggested by structural biology and at the small protein separations most relevant for the crowded membrane environments provided by living cells .

INTRODUCTION In many cell types , cell membranes are composed [ 1 ] of a diverse array of lipids , organized as a lipid bilayer , and membrane proteins , which play a central role in most cel - lular processes . Membrane proteins are rigid compared to the surrounding lipid bilayer [ 2 – 5 ] . Thus , the lipid bilayer typically deforms to accommodate membrane proteins and , in particular , the bilayer hydrophobic thickness is compressed or expanded compared to the preferred bi - layer thickness in the absence of membrane proteins [ 2 – 9 ] . Distinct conformations of a membrane protein gen - erally yield distinct energy costs of protein - induced lipid bilayer deformations . As a result , the lipid bilayer can serve as a “splint” stabilizing certain protein conforma - tions [ 5 ] and thereby regulate protein function [ 2 – 9 ] . In agreement with this general picture , experiments have revealed [ 10 – 17 ] that , across the kingdoms of life , cen - tral biological functions of integral membrane proteins such as ion exchange and signaling are regulated by the mechanical properties of the surrounding lipid bilayer , with the hydrophobic regions of membrane proteins cou - pling to the hydrophobic regions of lipid bilayers [ 18 – 20 ] . In particular , elastic bilayer thickness deformations have been found [ 2 – 9 ] to regulate the functions of a diverse range of integral membrane proteins . Cell membranes are crowded with membrane proteins [ 3 , 21 – 23 ] , with a typical mean center - to - center distance d ≈ 10 nm between neighboring proteins [ 7 ] . As a result , the elastic decay length of protein - induced lipid bilayer thickness deformations [ 24 – 26 ] is comparable to the typi - cal edge - to - edge spacing of proteins in cell membranes [ 7 ] , yielding thickness - mediated interactions between mem - brane proteins [ 7 , 27 – 30 ] . For the small protein sepa - rations relevant for cell membranes , thickness - mediated interactions between integral membrane proteins can be > 10 k B T in magnitude [ 7 , 31 ] and , depending on the hy - drophobic thickness of neighboring membrane proteins , be energetically favorable or unfavorable . The lipid bilayer elasticity theory [ 32 – 34 ] underlying the description of protein - induced bilayer deformations and bilayer - mediated protein interactions has a rich and distinguished history , dating back to the classic work of W . Helfrich [ 35 ] , P . B . Canham [ 36 ] , E . A . Evans [ 37 ] , and H . W . Huang [ 38 ] . According to this classic theory , mem - brane proteins may , in addition to thickness - mediated interactions [ 31 , 39 – 47 ] , also interact [ 7 , 48 ] via bilayer curvature deformations [ 49 – 64 ] and bilayer ﬂuctuations [ 49 , 61 – 68 ] . While the competition between thickness - , curvature - , and ﬂuctuation - mediated protein interactions depends on the properties of the speciﬁc lipids and mem - brane proteins under consideration , one generally ex - pects [ 7 , 31 ] that thickness - mediated protein interactions are strong and short - ranged , and that curvature - and a r X i v : 1611 . 00836v1 [ q - b i o . B M ] 2 N ov 2016 2 ﬂuctuation - mediated protein interactions are weak and long - ranged . The classic elasticity theory of protein - induced lipid bilayer deformations can be extended in various ways [ 44 , 45 , 69 – 86 ] to account for detailed molecular prop - erties of lipids such as lipid tilt and lipid intrinsic cur - vature [ 39 – 42 , 48 ] , yielding additional modes of bilayer - mediated protein interactions . Theoretical studies of bilayer - mediated protein interactions have largely fo - cused on idealized ( often cylindrical or conical ) protein shapes which do not correspond to any particular mem - brane protein , and proteins at large d . In contrast , bilayer - mediated protein interactions at small d are most relevant for the crowded environment provided by cell membranes [ 3 , 21 – 23 ] , while modern structural biology suggests a rich picture of membrane protein shape with experimental surveys of the protein content in various cell membranes [ 21 , 23 , 87 ] indicating great diversity in the oligomeric states and symmetries of membrane proteins . The central goal of this article is to provide a de - tailed discussion of a combined analytic and numerical framework [ 46 , 47 , 88 , 89 ] which allows prediction of lipid bilayer - mediated elastic interactions between inte - gral membrane proteins at arbitrary d for the protein shapes suggested by structural studies . We focus here on protein - induced lipid bilayer thickness deformations , which have been found [ 2 – 9 , 27 – 30 ] to play central roles in regulation of protein function and bilayer - mediated protein interactions in a wide range of experimental sys - tems [ 10 , 11 , 24 – 28 , 31 , 38 – 47 , 81 – 83 , 88 – 97 ] . Using this mathematical framework we have shown previously that the shape of integral membrane proteins , and re - sulting structure of lipid bilayer thickness deformations , can play a crucial role in the regulation of protein func - tion by lipid bilayers [ 47 , 88 ] , and that bilayer thickness - mediated interactions between integral membrane pro - teins can be strongly directional and dependent on pro - tein shape [ 46 , 47 , 89 , 97 ] . Thus , in addition to the magnitude of the bilayer - protein hydrophobic mismatch [ 2 – 9 , 27 – 30 ] , protein shape may be a crucial determi - nant of membrane protein regulation by lipid bilayers and bilayer - mediated protein interactions . We develop , illustrate , and test our analytic and nu - merical framework for calculating bilayer - mediated pro - tein interactions using the protein shapes shown in Fig . 1 , which embody key mechanisms by which protein crowd - ing and protein shape may aﬀect protein - induced lipid bilayer deformations . The most straightforward model of protein - induced lipid bilayer thickness deformations assumes a circular protein cross section with constant boundary conditions along the bilayer - protein interface [ see Fig . 1 ( a ) ] . The resulting “cylinder model” of mem - brane proteins allows investigation of thickness - mediated protein interactions in crowded membranes without the further complications introduced by a complicated pro - tein shape . The cylinder model has been used before in a number of diﬀerent settings [ 5 , 7 , 25 , 26 , 38 , 90 – 92 ] to describe protein - induced bilayer thickness deformations . FIG . 1 : ( Color online ) Overlapping lipid bilayer thickness de - formation ﬁelds can yield bilayer thickness - mediated interac - tions between membrane proteins . Bilayer thickness defor - mations u due to interacting membrane proteins obtained us - ing ( a ) the cylinder model , ( b ) the crown model , and ( c ) the clover - leaf model of integral membrane proteins ( see Sec . II for further details ) . The thickness deformations in panels ( a ) and ( b ) were obtained through exact analytic minimization of the thickness deformation energy ( see Sec . III ) , and the thick - ness deformations in panel ( c ) were calculated using ﬁnite el - ements ( see Sec . IV A ) . The clover - leaf shape in panel ( c ) pro - vides a simple coarse - grained model [ 46 , 47 , 88 , 89 ] of the ob - served closed - state structure of the pentameric mechanosen - sitive channel of large conductance [ 98 ] ( protein structural data shown as ribbon diagrams ; Protein Data Bank accession number 2OAR ) . The calculated lipid bilayer thickness defor - mations depend on lipid and protein properties , the protein center - to - center distance d , and , for the crown and clover - leaf models , the protein orientations ω 1 , 2 . The color scale ranges from u min = − 0 . 6 nm to u max = 0 . 4 nm . Aside from interactions with neighboring membrane proteins , angular variations in the bilayer - protein bound - ary conditions [ 46 , 93 – 96 ] or a non - circular protein cross section [ 46 , 47 , 88 , 89 , 97 ] may also break rotational sym - metry of bilayer thickness deformations about the protein 3 center . Simple representations of these two features of protein shape are provided [ 46 , 47 , 88 , 89 ] by the “crown model” [ see Fig . 1 ( b ) ] , in which we allow for angular vari - ations of the protein hydrophobic thickness while assum - ing a circular protein cross section , and by the “clover - leaf model” [ see Fig . 1 ( c ) ] , in which we assume constant boundary conditions along the bilayer - protein interface but allow for a non - circular shape of the protein cross section . In general , membrane proteins will have both a non - circular cross section and variable hydrophobic thickness . The crown and clover - leaf models allow us to isolate these two possible origins of angular anisotropy of protein - induced lipid bilayer deformations . An im - portant diﬀerence between the cylinder model , and the crown and clover - leaf models , is that for the latter mod - els bilayer - mediated protein interactions are inherently directional and depend not only on the protein separa - tion d but also on the protein orientations ω i , where the index i = 1 , 2 , . . . denotes diﬀerent membrane proteins [ Figs . 1 ( b , c ) ] . The organization of this article is as follows . Section II provides a detailed discussion of the elastic energy of lipid bilayer thickness deformations , and the cylinder , crown , and clover - leaf models of integral membrane proteins . In Sec . III we obtain , based on Refs . [ 38 – 42 , 49 , 50 ] , an - alytic solutions of the thickness deformation ﬁelds and thickness deformation energies due to cylinder , crown , and clover - leaf shapes at arbitrary d and protein orienta - tions . These analytic solutions are exact for cylinder and crown shapes , and perturbative for clover - leaf shapes . As described in Sec . IV , we complement our analytic solu - tions , and assess their validity , by developing numerical solution schemes based on ﬁnite element ( FE ) and ﬁ - nite diﬀerence ( FD ) solution procedures . In particular , the FE approach described here oﬀers a straightforward way of representing the complicated protein shapes sug - gested by membrane structural biology , and is eﬃcient and accurate enough to enable prediction of the direc - tional thickness - mediated interactions of hundreds of in - tegral membrane proteins at arbitrary d and protein ori - entations [ 47 , 89 ] with reasonably coarse computational grids . In Sec . V we provide a detailed comparison be - tween analytic and numerical results for the thickness deformation ﬁelds and thickness deformation energies im - plied by the cylinder model in the non - interacting and interacting regimes of d . Sections VI and VII provide similar comparisons between analytic and numerical re - sults for the crown and clover - leaf models . A summary of our results and conclusions can be found in Sec . VIII . II . ELASTIC MODEL OF PROTEIN - INDUCED BILAYER THICKNESS DEFORMATIONS A . Elastic thickness deformation energy In the standard elasticity theory of bilayer - protein in - teractions [ 4 – 7 ] , integral membrane proteins are assumed to be rigid membrane inclusions which deform the sur - rounding lipid bilayer [ 32 – 34 ] . In the simplest formula - tion , bilayer deformations can then be captured by two coupled scalar ﬁelds h + and h − which deﬁne the positions of the hydrophilic - hydrophobic interface in the outer and inner lipid bilayer leaﬂets , respectively . It is mathemat - ically convenient to express h + and h − in terms of the midplane deformation ﬁeld h = 1 2 ( h + + h − ) ( 1 ) and the thickness deformation ﬁeld u = 1 2 ( h + − h − − 2 a ) , ( 2 ) in which a is one - half the unperturbed hydrophobic thick - ness of the lipid bilayer . To leading order , the elastic energies governing h and u decouple from each other [ 38 , 48 ] . In the most straight - forward model of bilayer - protein interactions [ 4 – 7 , 32 – 34 , 38 , 39 , 49 , 50 ] , the energy cost of midplane de - formations is then captured by the Helfrich - Canham - Evans energy [ 35 – 37 ] and , within the Monge represen - tation , the energy cost of thickness deformations is of the form [ 5 , 26 , 38 ] G = 12 (cid:90) dxdy (cid:110) K b ( ∇ 2 u ) 2 + K t (cid:0) ua (cid:1) 2 + τ (cid:2) 2 ua + ( ∇ u ) 2 (cid:3)(cid:111) , ( 3 ) where K b is the bending rigidity of the lipid bilayer , K t is the stiﬀness associated with thickness deformations , and τ is the membrane tension . The eﬀective parameters K b , K t , and a in Eq . ( 3 ) encapsulate bilayer material properties relevant for protein - induced bilayer thickness deformations and depend on the bilayer composition [ 99 – 101 ] . Typical values measured in experiments are K b = 20 k B T , K t = 60 k B T / nm 2 , and a = 1 . 6 nm [ 5 , 7 ] , which we use for all the numerical calculations described here . The classic model of protein - induced lipid bilayer thickness deformations in Eq . ( 3 ) employs the Monge rep - resentation of surfaces , u = u ( x , y ) , with Cartesian co - ordinates ( x , y ) , and only considers leading - order terms in u and its derivatives . The former assumption can be justiﬁed by noting that thickness deformations generally decay rapidly compared to midplane deformations , with typical thickness and midplane decay lengths ≈ 1 nm and ≈ 5 – 500 nm [ 7 , 26 ] , respectively . The validity of the latter assumption depends on the speciﬁc properties of the lipid bilayer and protein under consideration , but for experimental model systems [ 24 – 26 , 28 , 31 , 89 , 91 , 92 ] one typically ﬁnds u / a < 0 . 3 and (cid:107)∇ u (cid:107) < 0 . 2 . Hence , bilayer overhangs and higher - order corrections to Eq . ( 3 ) can often be neglected when describing protein - induced lipid bilayer thickness deformations , with the bilayer mid - plane being approximately parallel to the reference plane invoked in the Monge representation of surfaces . The terms K b (cid:0) ∇ 2 u (cid:1) 2 and K t ( u / a ) 2 in Eq . ( 3 ) pro - vide lowest - order descriptions of the energy cost of bi - layer bending , and compression and expansion , of the 4 bilayer hydrophobic core , respectively . For generality we allow for the two tension terms 2 τu / a and τ ( ∇ u ) 2 in Eq . ( 3 ) , which account [ 32 – 34 ] for stretching deforma - tions tangential to the leaﬂet surfaces and changes in the projection of the bilayer area onto the reference plane , respectively . The minimal model in Eq . ( 3 ) can be ex - tended in a variety of ways to account for more detailed properties of lipid bilayers including lipid tilt [ 48 , 75 – 79 ] , lipid intrinsic curvature [ 39 – 42 , 45 , 70 , 71 ] , inhomoge - neous deformation of lipid volume and eﬀects of Gaus - sian curvature on protein - induced bilayer deformations [ 45 , 70 , 71 ] , asymmetric bilayer thickness deformations [ 45 , 70 , 71 , 80 ] , and protein - induced local modulation of bilayer elastic properties [ 44 , 81 – 86 ] . The lipid bilayer thickness deformation energy in Eq . ( 3 ) provides a simple model of thickness - mediated protein interactions , as well as the coupling between pro - tein function and bilayer thickness deformations , and has the appealing property that all the material param - eters entering Eq . ( 3 ) can be measured directly in ex - periments . For given bilayer - protein boundary condi - tions ( see Sec . II B ) , minimization of Eq . ( 3 ) completely speciﬁes the lowest - energy bilayer thickness conﬁgura - tion and its associated energy cost . Models based on Eq . ( 3 ) have been found to capture the basic experi - mental phenomenology of bilayer - protein interactions for gramicidin channels [ 10 , 11 , 27 , 38 , 43 , 44 , 81 – 83 , 90 – 92 ] , the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance ( MscL ) [ 24 – 26 , 28 , 31 , 46 , 47 , 88 , 89 ] , G - protein coupled receptors [ 93 – 96 ] , the bacterial leucine transporter [ 96 ] , and chemoreceptor lattices [ 97 ] , as well as a variety of other integral membrane proteins [ 4 – 9 ] . While we focus here on elastic thickness deformations , midplane defor - mations may generally also contribute [ 7 , 25 , 49 , 50 ] to bilayer - mediated protein interactions , and the regulation of protein function by bilayer mechanical properties . Minimization of Eq . ( 3 ) can be performed by solving the appropriate Euler - Lagrange equation , which is given by K b ∇ 4 u − τ ∇ 2 u + K t a 2 u + τ a = 0 . ( 4 ) The analytic solution of Eq . ( 4 ) is facilitated [ 88 ] by in - troducing the function ¯ u ( x , y ) = u ( x , y ) + τa K t , ( 5 ) in terms of which Eq . ( 4 ) can be expressed as (cid:0) ∇ 2 − ν + (cid:1) (cid:0) ∇ 2 − ν − (cid:1) ¯ u = 0 , ( 6 ) where ν ± = 1 2 K b (cid:34) τ ± (cid:18) τ 2 − 4 K b K t a 2 (cid:19) 1 / 2 (cid:35) . ( 7 ) To analytically calculate the thickness deformation en - ergy associated with the solutions of Eq . ( 4 ) we use Eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) to rearrange the thickness deformation energy in Eq . ( 3 ) as G = G 1 + 1 2 (cid:90) dxdy ∇ · (cid:2) K b ( ∇ ¯ u ) ∇ 2 ¯ u − K b ¯ u ∇ 3 ¯ u + τ ¯ u ∇ ¯ u (cid:3) , ( 8 ) where the term G 1 = − 1 2 (cid:90) dxdy τ 2 K t ( 9 ) is independent of ¯ u and arises , for τ > 0 , due to re - laxation of the “loading device” producing membrane tension [ 26 ] via uniform compression of the bilayer hy - drophobic core . Since G 1 does not contribute to the en - ergy cost of protein - induced bilayer deformations we sub - tract G 1 from G , G → G − G 1 . Using Gauss’s theorem , we then ﬁnd G = 1 2 (cid:90) dl ˆn · (cid:2) K b ( ∇ ¯ u ) ∇ 2 ¯ u − K b ¯ u ∇ 3 ¯ u + τ ¯ u ∇ ¯ u (cid:3) , ( 10 ) where the line integrals (cid:82) dl are to be taken along all bilayer - protein interfaces , with the bilayer unit normal vectors ˆn perpendicular to the bilayer - protein interfaces and pointing towards the proteins , and we assume [ 38 , 91 , 92 ] that ¯ u , as well as its derivatives , go to zero far from the proteins . B . Modeling protein shape Following previous work on lipid bilayer - protein inter - actions [ 4 – 7 , 38 , 39 , 49 , 50 ] we model integral membrane proteins as rigid membrane inclusions of ﬁxed shape and hydrophobic thickness . The speciﬁc properties of a given membrane protein enter our description of bilayer - protein interactions through the shape of the protein cross sec - tion , and through the boundary conditions on u along the bilayer - protein interface . As described in Sec . I , we consider here three distinct models of protein shape : the cylinder model , the crown model , and the clover - leaf model . These minimal models do not provide detailed descriptions of protein shape but , rather , aim to encap - sulate the features of a given protein hydrophobic surface most crucial for protein - induced lipid bilayer thickness deformations . As noted above , midplane deformations decouple to leading order from thickness deformations . Hence , the models of protein - induced bilayer thickness deformations considered here can be easily complemented by corresponding models of protein - induced bilayer mid - plane deformations [ 7 , 25 , 49 , 50 ] , which capture separate aspects of bilayer - protein interactions . 1 . Cylinder model A straightforward description of the eﬀect of protein shape on protein - induced lipid bilayer thickness defor - 5 mations is provided by the cylinder model of integral membrane proteins [ Fig . 1 ( a ) ] [ 5 , 7 , 25 , 26 , 38 , 90 – 92 ] . Introducing the polar coordinates ( r i , θ i ) with the cen - ter of membrane protein i as the origin , the boundary conditions for protein i can be written as u ( r i , θ i ) (cid:12)(cid:12) r i = C i ( θ i ) = U i , ( 11 ) ˆn · ∇ u ( r i , θ i ) (cid:12)(cid:12) r i = C i ( θ i ) = U (cid:48) i , ( 12 ) where the boundary curve C i ( θ i ) = R i for a membrane protein with a circular cross section of radius R i , and the constants [ 25 ] U i = 1 2 ( W i − 2 a ) , ( 13 ) U (cid:48) i = 1 2 (cid:0) H (cid:48) + − H (cid:48)− (cid:1) , ( 14 ) where W i is the hydrophobic thickness of protein i and the H (cid:48)± correspond to the normal derivatives of h ± eval - uated along the bilayer - protein boundary . Equation ( 13 ) assumes perfect hydrophobic match - ing between the membrane protein and the lipid bilayer [ 5 , 7 , 27 , 43 ] . This assumption is expected to break down for a large enough hydrophobic mismatch between the protein and the ( undeformed ) lipid bilayer [ 91 – 96 ] , in which case W i corresponds to the eﬀective hydropho - bic thickness of the membrane protein . Unless indicated otherwise , we use W i = 3 . 8 nm for the numerical calcu - lations described here , which approximately corresponds to [ 26 , 102 ] the hydrophobic thickness of the observed structure of closed pentameric MscL [ 98 ] . Following pre - vious work on MscL - induced lipid bilayer thickness defor - mations employing the cylinder model of integral mem - brane proteins [ 7 , 24 – 26 , 31 ] , we use R i = 2 . 3 nm , which yields an area of the transmembrane protein cross sec - tion consistent with the observed structure of closed pen - tameric MscL [ 98 ] . A number of diﬀerent choices for the boundary condition in Eq . ( 12 ) have been investigated [ 27 , 38 , 43 – 45 , 70 , 71 , 80 – 83 , 86 , 90 – 92 ] . In particular , U (cid:48) i may be chosen based on experimental observations or molecular dynamics simulations , or may be regarded as a free parameter to be ﬁxed as part of the energy minimiza - tion procedure . We follow here previous theoretical work on the experimental phenomenology of gramicidin chan - nels [ 27 , 38 , 43 ] and MscL [ 7 , 24 – 26 , 31 ] which suggests that , to a ﬁrst approximation , U (cid:48) i = 0 . 2 . Crown model The hydrophobic thickness of integral membrane pro - teins is generally expected to vary along the bilayer - protein interface [ 19 , 20 , 93 – 96 ] , yielding anisotropic bi - layer thickness deformations and , in the case of two or more membrane proteins in suﬃciently close proximity , directional interactions [ 46 ] . To study the generic eﬀects of a variable protein hydrophobic thickness on bilayer - mediated protein interactions we replace the constant U i in Eq . ( 11 ) by [ 46 ] U i ( θ i ) = U 0 i + δ i cos s ( θ i − ω i ) , ( 15 ) where U 0 i is the average hydrophobic mismatch , δ i is the magnitude of mismatch modulations , s is the protein symmetry , and ω i parametrizes the orientation of pro - tein i . For each bilayer leaﬂet , Eq . ( 15 ) yields a periodic modulation of the protein hydrophobic surface which re - sembles the shape of a crown [ Fig . 1 ( b ) ] , and we therefore refer to Eq . ( 15 ) as the crown model of integral membrane proteins . For our numerical calculations we use the values U 0 i = − 0 . 1 nm , δ i = 0 . 5 nm , and s = 5 in Eq . ( 15 ) , and vary ω i to explore bilayer thickness - mediated interactions for a range of relative protein orientations . We choose all other parameter values as described for the cylinder model of membrane proteins . Even for non - interacting mem - brane proteins , this parametrization of the crown model in Eq . ( 15 ) yields a maximum magnitude of the gradi - ent of bilayer thickness deformations ≈ 1 , and therefore produces thickness deformations which lie at the limit of applicability of the leading - order energy in Eq . ( 3 ) . Furthermore , for interacting membrane proteins we gen - erally ﬁnd with this parametrization of the crown model that the maximum magnitude of the gradient of bilayer thickness deformations > 1 . As a result , the numerical estimates of the thickness deformation energy obtained for this parametrization of Eq . ( 15 ) are of limited physi - cal signiﬁcance . We allow here for such large magnitudes of the gradient of bilayer thickness deformations in order to explore the mathematical limits of applicability of our analytic and numerical solution procedures ( see Sec . VI ) . 3 . Clover - leaf model Membrane structural biology has produced a rich and diverse picture of membrane protein shape , which sug - gests [ 21 , 23 , 87 , 103 ] that integral membrane proteins can occur in a variety of diﬀerent oligomeric states and transmembrane shapes . Distinct oligomeric states of membrane proteins generally yield distinct symmetries of the protein cross section which , in turn , induce dis - tinct symmetries of lipid bilayer thickness deformations [ 46 , 47 , 88 , 89 , 93 – 96 ] . The resulting non - trivial struc - ture of bilayer thickness deformations can yield substan - tial deviations from the energy cost of protein - induced bilayer thickness deformations implied by the cylinder model of integral membrane proteins . In particular , for MscL it has been found [ 46 , 47 , 88 , 89 ] that the elastic energy of protein - induced bilayer thickness deformations provides a signature of the protein oligomeric state , with distinct MscL oligomeric states yielding distinct MscL gating characteristics and directional bilayer - mediated protein interactions . A simple coarse - grained model of the cross sections of a diverse range of membrane proteins is provided by the 6 clover - leaf model [ 46 , 47 , 88 ] C i ( θ i ) = R i [ 1 + (cid:15) i cos s ( θ i − ω i ) ] , ( 16 ) where (cid:15) i parametrizes the magnitude of the deviation of the protein cross section from the circle [ Fig . 1 ( c ) ] . In particular , the structure of pentameric MscL observed in Mycobacterium tubercolosis [ 98 ] suggests [ 46 , 47 , 88 ] s = 5 , R i = 2 . 27 nm , and (cid:15) i = 0 . 22 , which we use for all the numerical calculations involving clover - leaf shapes described here . In general , the hydrophobic thickness of integral membrane proteins is expected to vary along the boundaries of clover - leaf shapes . However , in order to isolate the eﬀect of anisotropy in protein shape on bilayer thickness - mediated protein interactions we focus here on the simpler scenario of a constant hydrophobic thickness , and use for the clover - leaf model of integral membrane proteins the same boundary conditions on u along the bilayer - protein interface as for the cylinder model [ see Eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) ] . III . ANALYTIC SOLUTION Building on earlier work on the lipid bilayer thickness deformations induced by cylindrical membrane proteins [ 38 – 42 ] and bilayer curvature - mediated interactions be - tween conical membrane proteins in the far - ﬁeld limit [ 49 , 50 ] , we develop in this section analytic solutions [ 46 , 88 ] of the bilayer thickness - mediated interactions be - tween integral membrane proteins at arbitrary protein separations and relative orientations . To solve for the thickness - mediated interactions implied by Eq . ( 3 ) for two membrane proteins , we employ a two - center bipo - lar coordinate system ( see Fig . 2 ) . For the sake of sim - plicity , we assume in Fig . 2 that the two proteins have circular cross sections with radii R 1 , 2 . We relax this as - sumption below to capture interactions between clover - leaf shapes . To mathematically relate the polar coordi - nates ( r 1 , 2 , θ 1 , 2 ) centered about proteins 1 and 2 , we note from Fig . 2 the bipolar coordinate transformations r 2 = (cid:0) d 2 + r 21 + 2 dr 1 cos θ 1 (cid:1) 1 / 2 , ( 17 ) cos θ 2 = ( d + r 1 cos θ 1 ) / r 2 , and sin θ 2 = ( r 1 sin θ 1 ) / r 2 . The corresponding transformations for r 1 and sin θ 1 are symmetric in the protein indices , but cos θ 1 = − ( d − r 2 cos θ 2 ) / r 1 . We solve the Euler - Lagrange equation ( 6 ) by making the ansatz [ 46 , 50 ] ¯ u = ¯ u 1 ( r 1 , θ 1 ) + ¯ u 2 ( r 2 , θ 2 ) , ( 18 ) where the ¯ u i ( r i , θ i ) are the solutions of Eq . ( 6 ) for a single protein i = 1 , 2 , which are of the form [ 38 , 104 ] ¯ u i ( r i , θ i ) = f + i ( r i , θ i ) + f − i ( r i , θ i ) , ( 19 ) where the f ± i are solutions of the Helmholtz equations ∇ 2 f ± i = ν ± f ± i .

For the exterior of a circle of radius R i , the above Helmholtz equations are readily solved by separation of variables [ 104 , 105 ] . Thus , the general single - protein so - lution of Eq . ( 6 ) can be constructed from f ± i ( r i , θ i ) = A ± i , 0 K 0 ( √ ν ± r i ) + C ± i , 0 I 0 ( √ ν ± r i ) + ∞ (cid:88) n = 1 (cid:8) A ± i , n + B ± i , n + C ± i , n + D ± i , n (cid:9) , ( 21 ) where A ± i , 0 and B ± i , 0 are constants , the Fourier - Bessel terms A ± i , n = A ± i , n K n ( √ ν ± r i ) cos nθ i , ( 22 ) B ± i , n = B ± i , n K n ( √ ν ± r i ) sin nθ i , ( 23 ) C ± i , n = C ± i , n I n ( √ ν ± r i ) cos nθ i , ( 24 ) D ± i , n = D ± i , n I n ( √ ν ± r i ) sin nθ i , ( 25 ) the I j and K j with j ≥ 0 are the modiﬁed Bessel func - tions of the ﬁrst and second kind , and A ± i , n , B ± i , n , C ± i , n , D ± i , n with n ≥ 1 are constants . Assuming that ¯ u → 0 as r i → ∞ [ 38 , 91 , 92 ] , we have C ± i , 0 = C ± i , n = D ± i , n = 0 for n ≥ 1 , and Eq . ( 21 ) reduces to [ 88 ] f ± i ( r i , θ i ) = A ± i , 0 K 0 ( √ ν ± r i ) + N (cid:88) n = 1 (cid:8) A ± i , n + B ± i , n (cid:9) , ( 26 ) where N → ∞ corresponds to the full single - protein so - lution . If the boundary conditions on u along the bilayer - protein interfaces are such that y → − y in Fig . 2 we have , by symmetry , that B ± n = 0 for n ≥ 1 . Substitution of Eq . ( 19 ) with Eq . ( 26 ) into Eq . ( 18 ) yields the solution of the thickness deformations induced by two membrane proteins . To use Eq . ( 10 ) to eval - uate the elastic energy associated with these thickness 7 deformations , and to impose suitable boundary condi - tions along the bilayer - protein interfaces , we recast— along the bilayer - protein boundary associated with pro - tein 2—¯ u 1 ( r 1 , θ 1 ) in terms of r 2 , sin θ 2 , and cos θ 2 , and vice versa . For protein 2 , this is achieved [ 106 ] by ﬁrst expanding the bipolar coordinate transformations for r 1 , sin θ 1 , and cos θ 1 , and then the expression for ¯ u 1 ( r 1 , θ 1 ) in Eq . ( 19 ) , in terms of r (cid:48) 2 = r 2 / d up to some order M in r (cid:48) 2 . Steric constraints mandate d > R 1 + R 2 and , hence , r (cid:48) 2 < 1 along the bilayer - protein boundary asso - ciated with protein 2 . Following a similar procedure for protein 1 , Eq . ( 18 ) yields explicit expressions for ¯ u in terms of ( r 2 , θ 2 ) in the vicinity of protein 2 and in terms of ( r 1 , θ 1 ) in the vicinity of protein 1 . We note that ex - pansion of u 1 ( r 1 , θ 1 ) around protein 2 up to order M in r (cid:48) 2 produces angular variations in θ 2 up to sin Mθ 2 and cos Mθ 2 . We set M = N to ensure that these “sec - ondary” angular variations , which are introduced into the general solution in Eq . ( 18 ) via expansion of the bipolar coordinate transformations , are of the same maximum order as the angular variations captured directly by the Fourier - Bessel series in Eq . ( 26 ) [ 107 ] . The expansions described above yield explicit expres - sions for ¯ u in terms of ( r 1 , θ 1 ) and ( r 2 , θ 2 ) in the vicinity of proteins 1 and 2 , respectively . Thus , the expression for the thickness deformation energy in Eq . ( 10 ) can be written as G = − 1 2 R 1 (cid:90) 2 π 0 dθ 1 g 1 ( θ 1 ) − 1 2 R 2 (cid:90) 2 π 0 dθ 2 g 2 ( θ 2 ) , ( 27 ) where the overall minus signs arise because the bilayer normal vectors point towards decreasing r i along the bilayer - protein interfaces , and the boundary energy den - sities g 1 ( θ 1 ) = (cid:20) K b ∂ ¯ u ∂r 1 ∇ 21 ¯ u − K b ¯ u ∂ ∂r 1 ∇ 21 ¯ u + τ ¯ u ∂ ¯ u ∂r 1 (cid:21) r 1 = R 1 , ( 28 ) g 2 ( θ 2 ) = (cid:20) K b ∂ ¯ u ∂r 2 ∇ 22 ¯ u − K b ¯ u ∂ ∂r 2 ∇ 22 ¯ u + τ ¯ u ∂ ¯ u ∂r 2 (cid:21) r 2 = R 2 ( 29 ) are evaluated using ¯ u ( r 1 , θ 1 ) and ¯ u ( r 2 , θ 2 ) , respectively , in which we have noted that | ˆn · ∇ | = ∂∂r along the cir - cumference of a circle , and the Laplace operators ∇ 2 i = ∂ 2 ∂r 2 i + 1 r i ∂ ∂r i + 1 r 2 i ∂ 2 ∂θ 2 i ( 30 ) in polar coordinates , where i = 1 , 2 . As a result of our expansions of the bipolar coordinate transformations , ¯ u around proteins 1 and 2 only depends on θ 1 , 2 through linear sums over sin jθ 1 , 2 and cos jθ 1 , 2 with j ≥ 0 , and it is therefore straightforward [ 106 ] to analytically evaluate the angular integrals in Eq . ( 27 ) , resulting in an algebraic expression for G . In the case of two interacting membrane proteins , the general solution in Eq . ( 18 ) contains the 4 ( 2 N + 1 ) coeﬃ - cients A ± i , 0 , A ± i , n , and B ± i , n with i = 1 , 2 and n = 1 , . . . , N . These coeﬃcients are determined by the boundary con - ditions through the linear system of equations Mc = b , ( 31 ) where the vector c is of length 4 ( 2 N + 1 ) and contains each coeﬃcient appearing in Eq . ( 18 ) as a separate ele - ment . The vector b contains the boundary conditions on ¯ u and its radial derivatives , at proteins 1 and 2 , at each order in sin jθ and cos jθ with j ≥ 0 as separate elements . At j = 0 , we have two boundary conditions for each pro - tein , yielding four elements in b . Similarly , for j > 1 we have four boundary conditions at each order in j for each protein yielding , in total , the 4 ( 2 N + 1 ) indepen - dent boundary conditions required to ﬁx the 4 ( 2 N + 1 ) independent coeﬃcients appearing in Eq . ( 18 ) . Finally , the rows of the matrix M are constructed from the coeﬃ - cients of sin jθ and cos jθ with j ≥ 0 in Eq . ( 18 ) and their radial derivatives , at proteins 1 and 2 , with each column corresponding to a particular coeﬃcient . For two pro - teins one therefore obtains four rows at j = 0 and eight rows at each j > 0 yielding , as required , a square matrix of order 4 ( 2 N + 1 ) . Solution of Eq . ( 31 ) for the coeﬃcients c [ 106 ] yields [ 46 ] , as N → ∞ , the exact thickness deformations u in Eqs . ( 5 ) and ( 18 ) induced by arbitrary protein conﬁgu - rations and , via Eq . ( 27 ) , the associated thickness defor - mation energy G . However , to make the above solution procedure analytically tractable it is , in practice , neces - sary to truncate the respective Fourier - Bessel series , and expansions of the bipolar coordinate transformations , at some ﬁnite value of N . Such a truncation relies on the as - sumption that , beyond N , angular variations in Eq . ( 18 ) can be neglected . The validity of this assumption for a given value of N can be conﬁrmed [ 46 ] by systemati - cally including higher - order terms . For large N , it can be convenient to substitute numerical values for all model parameters , and to numerically solve for c in Eq . ( 31 ) . The above analytic solution procedure can be imple - mented directly for the boundary conditions associated with the cylinder and crown models of membrane pro - teins discussed in Secs . II B 1 and II B 2 . For the clover - leaf model discussed in Sec . II B 3 , suitable ( approximate ) boundary conditions can be obtained perturbatively from Eq . ( 16 ) [ 46 , 88 ] by expanding the left - hand sides of Eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) in terms of the small parameter (cid:15) i [ 52 ] , and noting that cos s ( θ i − ω i ) = cos sθ i cos sω i + sin sθ i sin sω 1 . ( 32 ) To leading order in (cid:15) i , Eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) are then 8 given by ¯ u ( R i , θ i ) + F i ( R i ) cos sθ i + G i ( R i ) sin sθ i = U i + τa K t , ( 33 ) ∂ ¯ u ( r i , θ i ) ∂r i (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) r i = R i + F (cid:48) i ( R i ) cos sθ i + G (cid:48) i ( R i ) sin sθ i = U (cid:48) i , ( 34 ) where F i ( r i ) = R i (cid:15) i ∂ ¯ u ( r i , θ i ) ∂r i cos sω i , ( 35 ) G i ( r i ) = R i (cid:15) i ∂ ¯ u ( r i , θ i ) ∂r i sin sω i . ( 36 ) Note that , for protein conﬁgurations which satisfy sin sω i = 0 , only cosine modes must be considered in the above expressions because , for such conﬁgurations , the arrangement in Fig . 2 is symmetric under y → − y . For the sake of simplicity , we approximate ¯ u in Eqs . ( 35 ) and ( 36 ) by only including the rotationally symmetric “background” ﬁelds about proteins 1 and 2 in Eq . ( 18 ) . Bilayer thickness - mediated interactions in the clover - leaf model of integral membrane proteins can then be ana - lyzed following the same steps as for the cylinder and crown models , but with the additional approximations inherent in Eqs . ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) . IV . NUMERICAL SOLUTION The FE framework provides a versatile numerical ap - proach for handling protein - induced lipid bilayer defor - mations in crowded membranes . We have developed a general FE scheme [ 47 , 89 ] for the numerical study of bilayer - protein interactions which allows reliable and ef - ﬁcient minimization of Eq . ( 3 ) for hundreds of interacting integral membrane proteins with complicated shapes and boundary conditions . To complement our FE approach , we have also developed a FD scheme for the minimization of Eq . ( 3 ) . In this section we provide a detailed descrip - tion of our FE and FD solution procedures , which permit minimization of Eq . ( 3 ) for eﬀectively arbitrary protein shapes , separations , and orientations . While the analytic solution described in Sec . III allows for inﬁnitely large system sizes , numerical solutions are necessarily restricted to ﬁnite solution domains . With the exception of special cases such as provided by pe - riodic systems [ 89 ] , numerical minimization of Eq . ( 3 ) therefore relies on the assumption that the energy cost of thickness deformations decays suﬃciently rapidly at large distances from the proteins so that ﬁnite size eﬀects can be neglected . This assumption is violated for ﬁnite mem - brane tensions in Eq . ( 3 ) , in which case the magnitude of G 1 in Eq . ( 9 ) increases with bilayer area and , indeed , becomes inﬁnite in the limit of inﬁnitely large lipid bilay - ers . However , G 1 does not contribute to the energy cost of protein - induced lipid bilayer thickness deformations . Thus , direct comparisons between analytic and numeri - cal solutions of the energy cost of protein - induced lipid bilayer thickness deformations in the non - interacting as well as interacting regimes can be made , even for τ > 0 , by subtracting the ( ﬁnite ) value of G 1 associated with a speciﬁc choice for the size of the solution domain from the numerical solution , and ( formally ) subtracting the corre - sponding ( inﬁnite ) value of G 1 from the analytic solution as in Eq . ( 10 ) . Furthermore , as we discuss below , com - parisons between analytic and numerical results for the thickness deformation ﬁeld , rather than the thickness de - formation energy , over identical ( ﬁnite ) bilayer areas for the analytic and numerical solutions provide an alterna - tive approach for testing our numerical solution proce - dures . This approach does not rely on subtracting G 1 in Eq . ( 8 ) . A . Finite elements The FE framework [ 108 , 109 ] was developed to per - mit reliable and computationally eﬃcient numerical solu - tions of boundary value problems involving large compu - tational domains with complicated boundary shapes and boundary conditions . This makes the FE approach well suited for the calculation of lipid bilayer - mediated protein interactions in crowded membranes with many interact - ing proteins . Using MscL as a model system , we have shown previously [ 47 , 89 ] that the FE approach makes it feasible to predict directional bilayer - mediated protein interactions in systems composed of hundreds of integral membrane proteins . While standard FE methods based on Lagrange in - terpolation functions [ 108 ] are suﬃcient to compute the thickness stretch and tension terms in Eq . ( 3 ) , the curva - ture term , being second order in derivatives , requires C 1 continuity [ 109 ] and therefore cannot be handled through Lagrange interpolation functions . The discrete Kirchhoﬀ triangle ( DKT ) method oﬀers an elegant and eﬃcient way to circumvent this limitation [ 110 , 111 ] . In particu - lar , to bypass C 1 continuity , the DKT approach employs a plate theory allowing for transverse shear deformations , in which case C 0 continuity is suﬃcient . The Kirchhoﬀ hypothesis of zero transverse shear is then enforced dis - cretely along the edges of the triangular elements , thus ensuring the conformity of curvatures at element inter - faces . In our FE framework for calculating bilayer thickness - mediated interactions between integral membrane pro - teins [ 47 , 89 ] we adopt a hybrid FE approach , in which we combine the DKT formulation for the bending terms [ 110 ] with standard Lagrange interpolation for the thick - ness stretch and gradient terms [ 108 ] . To derive the stiﬀ - ness matrix associated with this hybrid FE approach , we 9 rewrite Eq . ( 3 ) in Cartesian coordinates , G = 12 (cid:82) dxdy (cid:26) K b (cid:16) ∂ 2 u ∂x 2 + ∂ 2 u ∂y 2 (cid:17) 2 + K t a 2 u 2 + τ (cid:20)(cid:0) ∂u∂x (cid:1) 2 + (cid:16) ∂u∂y (cid:17) 2 (cid:21) + 2 τa u (cid:27) . ( 37 ) The variation of Eq . ( 37 ) is given by δG = (cid:90) dxdy ( δ (cid:15) ) T D (cid:15) + (cid:90) dxdy τ aδu , ( 38 ) with the generalized strain vector (cid:15) T = (cid:20) u ∂u ∂x ∂u ∂y ∂ 2 u ∂x 2 ∂ 2 u ∂y 2 (cid:21) , ( 39 ) and the constitutive matrix D =    K t a 2 0 0 0 0 0 τ 0 0 0 0 0 τ 0 0 0 0 0 K b K b 0 0 0 K b K b    . ( 40 ) While the displacements u 1 , u 2 , and u 3 of the corner nodes of each FE triangle are suﬃcient to deﬁne Lagrange interpolation functions , the DKT approach requires nine degrees of freedom per triangle , U T = [ u 1 θ x 1 θ y 1 u 2 θ x 2 θ y 2 u 3 θ x 3 θ y 3 ] , ( 41 ) where the partial derivatives θ xi = u i , y and θ yi = − u i , x with i = 1 , 2 , or 3 correspond to rotations at the cor - ner nodes of each FE triangle . We use the strain - displacement transformation matrix B =   G T G T , x G T , y H Tx , x H Ty , y   ( 42 ) to construct the strain vector (cid:15) = BU , where the linear triangular shape functions G are given in Ref . [ 108 ] and the DKT shape functions H are given in Ref . [ 110 ] . Finally , the FE thickness deformation energy is ob - tained by summing over all ﬁnite elements , G FE = (cid:88) e ∈ elements (cid:0) U e ) T ( K e U e + f e (cid:1) , ( 43 ) in which the element stiﬀness matrix K e and “internal tension” f e are given by K e = 2 A e (cid:90) dξdη B T DB , f e = 2 A e (cid:90) dξdη τ a G . ( 44 ) FIG . 3 : ( Color online ) Thickness deformations u minimizing Eq . ( 3 ) obtained using our FE approach for two clover - leaf pentamers . The triangular mesh ( black overlay ) indicates the mesh used in the FE calculation , and is generated using the frontal algorithm of the gmsh package [ 112 ] . All model parameters were chosen as described in Sec . II . The above integrals are performed over the local coordi - nates ( ξ , η ) using second - order ( three points per element ) Gaussian quadrature , and scaled by the area A e of the element . To enforce the general boundary conditions along the bilayer - protein interfaces in Eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) we ﬁx ( u , θ x , θ y ) = ( U , ( U t ) , y , − ( U t ) , x ) for the nodes deﬁning the protein boundaries , where ( U t ) , x and ( U t ) , y are x and y projections of the thickness gradient U t along the contour of the bilayer - protein interfaces . For the cylinder and clover - leaf models of protein shape the hydrophobic thickness is constant along the bilayer - protein interface , and we therefore impose U t = 0 . For the crown model we have U t ( θ ) = − δs sin ( θ − ω ) from the hydrophobic thick - ness variation in Eq . ( 15 ) . For the nodes deﬁning the outer boundary of the simulation domain we do not con - strain u and its derivatives . We assemble the thickness deformation energy in Eq . ( 43 ) in C + + using the varia - tional mechanics library voom and minimize Eq . ( 43 ) by employing the l - bfgs - b solver [ 113 ] . Figure 3 shows a representative thickness deformation proﬁle obtained for two clover - leaf pentamers together with the correspond - ing triangular mesh used in the FE calculation , which we generate using the frontal algorithm of the gmsh package [ 112 ] . We check the accuracy of our FE procedure by com - paring the total thickness deformation energies predicted by analytic and FE approaches for the cases in which ex - act analytic results on protein - induced lipid bilayer thick - ness deformations are available [ 38 , 46 , 88 ] ( see Sec . III ) . As discussed above , such comparisons necessitate sub - tracting G 1 in Eq . ( 9 ) . To complement these tests , we also compare our analytic and FE approaches using the analytic and FE solutions for the thickness deformation ﬁeld . This approach for quantifying the level of agree - 10 ment between analytic and FE approaches does not rely on subtracting G 1 in Eq . ( 9 ) . In particular , following Ref . [ 114 ] we monitor the percentage error in the thick - ness deformations obtained from the FE approximation , u h , relative to the analytic solution , u , η u = 100 × | | u − u h | | L 2 | | u | | L 2 , ( 45 ) and the corresponding percentage error in curvature de - formations , η ∇ 2 u = 100 × | u − u h | W 2 , 2 | u | W 2 , 2 , ( 46 ) where the L 2 norm | | u | | L 2 = (cid:18)(cid:90) u 2 dxdy (cid:19) 12 ( 47 ) and the Sobolev semi - norm | u | W 2 , 2 = (cid:18)(cid:90) ( ∇ 2 u ) 2 dxdy (cid:19) 12 ( 48 ) are evaluated by numerical quadrature over identical ( ﬁ - nite ) bilayer areas for the analytic and numerical solu - tions , using an approximately circular integration do - main with radius ≈ 22 nm . B . Finite diﬀerences FD methods have been employed previously to study the bilayer thickness deformations induced by gramicidin channels [ 43 , 44 , 82 , 90 , 115 ] , MscL [ 31 ] , G - protein cou - pled receptors [ 93 , 94 , 96 ] , and the bacterial leucine trans - porter [ 96 ] . In our FD scheme , we discretize the lipid bilayer domain of interest using a hexagonal grid with H × H nodes and lattice spacing h [ see Fig . 4 ( a ) ] . We denote the nodal values of the thickness deformations by u i , j . Taylor series expansion then yields the discretized Laplace operator ∇ 2 u i , j = 1 h 2 (cid:20) 2 3 ( u i − 1 , j + 1 + u i , j + 1 + u i − 1 , j + u i + 1 , j + u i , j − 1 + u i + 1 , j − 1 − 6 u i , j ) (cid:21) . ( 49 ) Minimization of the thickness deformation energy in Eq . ( 3 ) via solution of the Euler - Lagrange equation ( 4 ) using FD requires an expression for the discretized bi - harmonic term ∇ 4 u i , j . We obtain ∇ 4 u i , j by applying the discretized Laplace operator in Eq . ( 49 ) two times , resulting in a 19 - point stencil with the coeﬃcients shown in Fig . 4 ( a ) . For our FD calculations we focus on the case of zero membrane tension , for which Eq . ( 3 ) yields the FD thick - ness deformation energy G FD = √ 3 h 2 2 (cid:88) i , j (cid:20) K b 2 (cid:0) ∇ 2 u i , j (cid:1) 2 + K t 2 a 2 u 2 i , j (cid:21) , ( 50 ) 1 2 1 2 - 10 - 10 2 1 - 10 42 - 10 1 2 - 10 - 10 2 1 2 1 i = - 3 - 2 - 1 0 1 2 3 j = - 3 - 2 - 1 0 1 2 ( a ) ( b ) FIG . 4 : ( Color online ) Illustration of the hexagonal grid used for our FD calculations . ( a ) Nodal values of the discretized thickness deformation ﬁeld u i , j are indexed by i along the hor - izontal direction and by j along the oblique direction . The 19 - point stencil discretizing the biharmonic operator at position ( i , j ) = ( 0 , 0 ) is found by multiplying u i , j and nearby nodal values of the thickness deformation ﬁeld by the indicated co - eﬃcients , adding up these contributions , and dividing by h 4 . ( b ) We choose the protein boundary points ( blue circles ) to correspond to the nodes closest to the exact protein bound - ary curve ( grey clover - leaf shape ; see Sec . II B 3 ) , and impose the general boundary condition in Eq . ( 11 ) at these nodes . We use a layer of interior points ( red squares ) , together with corresponding exterior points ( see main text ) , to impose the general boundary condition in Eq . ( 12 ) . in which nodal contributions are scaled with the unit area associated with each node . Collecting nodal values of the thickness mismatch u i , j into a vector u of length H 2 , we recast the energy in Eq . ( 50 ) into the matrix form G FD = √ 3 h 2 2 (cid:20) K b 2 ( Lu ) T ( Lu ) + K t 2 a 2 u T u (cid:21) = √ 3 h 2 2 (cid:20) K b 2 (cid:0) u T Nu (cid:1) + K t 2 a 2 u T u (cid:21) ≡ u T Qu , ( 51 ) 11 where Q = √ 3 h 2 2 (cid:18) K b 2 N + K t 2 a 2 I (cid:19) , ( 52 ) and L , N = L T L , and I are H 2 × H 2 Laplacian , bihar - monic , and identity matrices , respectively . In each row , the matrices L and N have the coeﬃcients of the dis - crete Laplace and biharmonic operators associated with a single node as their elements , respectively . The matri - ces L and N are therefore highly sparse , with non - zero elements organized according to the node ordering of the vector u . To enforce the general bilayer - protein boundary con - ditions in Eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) in our FD scheme we ﬁnd all grid points at a distance less than h / 2 from the pro - tein boundary , as illustrated in Fig . 4 ( b ) for clover - leaf shapes . We take these nodes to deﬁne the protein bound - ary in our FD scheme , and impose the boundary con - dition in Eq . ( 11 ) by setting u i , j = U along the dis - cretized protein boundary . To enforce the boundary con - dition on ˆn · ∇ u in Eq . ( 12 ) we ﬁnd , for each protein , the nodes in the interior of the protein boundary curve within a distance b from the protein boundary so that h / 2 < b < 3 h / 2 . For each of these interior points we then ﬁnd a mirror symmetric point exterior to the pro - tein boundary curve such that interior and exterior points are connected by a line of length 2 b which is normal to the exact protein boundary curve . In order to satisfy the boundary condition U (cid:48) i = 0 used here , we impose the constraint that the values of u i , j at the interior and exte - rior points are equal to each other ( other choices for the value of U (cid:48) i could be implemented following analogous steps ) . Here a complication arises in that the exterior points are typically not grid points . We address this is - sue by interpolating , for each exterior point , the values of the thickness deformation ﬁeld at the three nearest grid points . Due to the substantial computational cost associated with our FD scheme we only employ here the FD ap - proach to study mirror - symmetric protein conﬁgurations . For two proteins located at ( ± d / 2 , 0 ) the size of the so - lution domain can then be reduced by a factor of one - half by imposing mirror - symmetric boundary conditions along the boundary line x = 0 ( see Fig . 2 ) . For the re - maining boundaries of the solution domain we set u = 0 . For all our FD calculations we use a rectangular solution domain of side lengths ( 25 , 25 √ 3 / 2 ) nm with the pro - tein center placed on the longer midline of the rectangle . We check that our results are robust with respect to in - creases in the size of the solution domain . To minimize the thickness deformation energy we construct the dis - cretized version of the Euler - Lagrange equation ( 4 ) for τ = 0 , Qu = v , ( 53 ) deﬁned for the nodal values u of all FD grid points . To enforce the boundary conditions in Eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) we adjust the rows of the matrix Q in Eq . ( 53 ) correspond - ing to the FD boundary nodes so as to ﬁx the value of u i , j at these nodes , as described above . Accordingly , the vector v contains non - zero elements at rows correspond - ing to the boundary nodes . We solve the linear system in Eq . ( 53 ) using the sparse matrix structures and solvers provided by the numerical computing environment mat - lab [ 116 ] . We calculate the corresponding thickness de - formation energy using Eq . ( 51 ) for the nodal values of all FD grid points lying outside the protein domains . V . CYLINDER MODEL In this section we focus on the most straightforward scenario of lipid bilayer thickness deformations induced by cylindrical membrane proteins [ Fig . 1 ( a ) ] , and com - pare numerical results obtained using our FE and FD schemes to the corresponding exact analytic solutions . As discussed above , we subtract G 1 in Eq . ( 9 ) to com - pare thickness deformation energies obtained using nu - merical and analytic solution procedures . We ﬁrst con - sider the bilayer thickness deformations induced by cylin - drical membrane proteins in the non - interacting regime of large protein separations , and then discuss the bilayer thickness deformations induced by two interacting cylin - drical membrane proteins . A . Non - interacting cylindrical membrane proteins For a single cylindrical membrane protein , the protein - induced lipid bilayer thickness deformations are rotation - ally symmetric about the protein , with the exact analytic solution [ 38 ] corresponding to the zeroth - order terms in the general solution in Eq . ( 19 ) . The radial proﬁle of this exact analytic solution about the membrane protein is governed by zeroth - order modiﬁed Bessel functions of the second kind , yielding an approximately exponential decay of thickness deformations with a periodic modu - lation [ 38 – 40 ] and a characteristic length scale of thick - ness deformations λ = ( a 2 K b / K t ) 1 / 4 ≈ 1 nm [ 7 , 26 ] [ see Fig . 5 ( a ) ] . The thickness deformation proﬁles obtained using our FE and FD solution procedures are in excellent quantitative agreement with the corresponding analytic solution [ Fig . 5 ( a ) ] . Computing the percentage diﬀerence between numerical and analytic results for the thickness deformation energy , η G = 100 × (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) G numerical − G analytic G analytic (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) , ( 54 ) we ﬁnd that the thickness deformation energies obtained using analytic , FE , and FD approaches are also in ex - cellent quantitative agreement [ Fig . 5 ( b ) ] . As expected from scaling arguments [ 7 , 24 , 25 ] , all three solution pro - cedures yield an approximately quadratic dependence of the thickness deformation energy on hydrophobic mis - match . 12 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 r ( nm ) u ( n m ) Analytic Finite elements Finite diﬀerences 2 7 12 - 0 . 0001 0 0 . 0001 ∆ u ( n m ) r ( nm ) ( a ) 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 20 40 60 80 ( b ) U ( nm ) G ( un i t s o f k B T ) Analytic Finite elements Finite diﬀerences 0 . 1 0 . 5 0 . 075 0 . 09 η G U ( nm ) FIG . 5 : ( Color online ) Lipid bilayer thickness deformations due to a single cylindrical membrane protein .

For the FE solution we used an av - erage edge size of the FE mesh (cid:104) l edge (cid:105) = 0 . 3 nm , and for the FD solution we used a lattice spacing h = 0 . 05 nm . We set τ = 0 for both panels . All model parameters were chosen as described in Sec . II , and analytic and numerical solutions were obtained as discussed in Secs . III and IV . The convergence of the FE and FD solutions towards the exact analytic solution can be quantiﬁed by system - atically increasing the spatial resolution of the numeri - cal solution schemes . We ﬁnd that for the FE solution the percentage errors in thickness and curvature defor - mations in Eqs . ( 45 ) and ( 46 ) , which are summed over the entire solution domain , monotonically decrease with decreasing average edge size of the FE mesh , (cid:104) l edge (cid:105) [ see Fig . 6 ( a ) ] . In particular , the thickness deformation error decreases approximately quadratically with decreasing (cid:104) l edge (cid:105) , while the curvature deformation error decreases approximately linearly with decreasing (cid:104) l edge (cid:105) . As shown in Fig . 6 ( b ) ( red solid curve ) , the error in the thickness deformation energy decreases quadratically with decreas - ing (cid:104) l edge (cid:105) .

For the FD solution ( red solid curve in Fig . 7 ) the error in the thickness deformation energy decreases approxi - mately linearly with decreasing lattice spacing h . The central - diﬀerence Laplacian FD stencil we used here is second - order accurate . The linear convergence is there - fore most likely an indication that the FD error is dom - inated by the enforcement of the slope boundary condi - tions . Furthermore , we ﬁnd that , for the parameter val - ues used for Fig . 7 , the percentage error in the thickness deformation energy is smaller than 0 . 5 % for resolutions h ≤ 0 . 2 nm . Thus , we ﬁnd that the FE and FD solutions both yield good agreement with the exact analytic solu - tion for high enough spatial resolutions of the numerical solution schemes . However , Figs . 6 ( b ) and 7 also show that , compared to the FD solution procedure , the FE solution procedure yields accurate results even at rela - 13 0 . 01 0 . 1 10 − 2 10 − 1 10 0 10 1 ∼ h 1 h ( nm ) η G d = 14 nm d = 5 nm FIG . 7 : ( Color online ) Percentage diﬀerence between ana - lytic and FD results for the thickness deformation energy per cylindrical membrane protein , η G in Eq .

III and IV . tively low average spatial resolutions , and converges more rapidly towards the exact analytic result for the thickness deformation energy with increasing average spatial reso - lution . This suggests that the FE solution procedure is more eﬃcient and , for a given average spatial resolution , more accurate than the FD scheme used here . B . Interacting cylindrical membrane proteins For cylindrical membrane proteins of the same hy - drophobic thickness , our analytic and numerical solution schemes imply that , for the bilayer and protein parame - ter values used here , bilayer thickness - mediated interac - tions are strongly favorable for protein center - to - center distances smaller than d ≈ 8 nm ( see Fig . 8 ) . For in - termediate protein separations d ≈ 8 – 12 nm , thickness - mediated interactions are weakly unfavorable . We ﬁnd that thickness - mediated interactions are practically neg - ligible for protein separations greater than d ≈ 12 nm or minimum protein edge - to - edge separations greater than ≈ 7 λ . The non - monotonic dependence of bilayer thickness - mediated interactions on protein separation ( Fig . 8 ) can be understood [ 97 ] by considering how the bilayer thick - ness deformations due to single isolated membrane pro - teins would interfere . As noted in Sec . V A , the thickness deformation proﬁle induced by a single cylindrical mem - brane protein relaxes rapidly away from the protein , but overshoots with respect to the unperturbed lipid bilayer thickness [ 38 – 40 ] [ Fig . 5 ( a ) ] . Indeed , the zeroth - order modiﬁed Bessel functions of the second kind appearing in the general solution in Eq . ( 18 ) imply successive ex - pansion and compression zones of the lipid bilayer thick - ness around each protein .

( 18 ) , and numerically us - ing our FE and FD solution procedures . The inset shows the percentage diﬀerence in thickness deformation energy , η G in Eq . ( 54 ) , between the analytic solution at N = 11 and the corresponding results of FE ( blue dashed curve ) and FD ( orange solid curve ) calculations . For the FE solution we used (cid:104) l edge (cid:105) ≈ 0 . 27 nm and for the FD solution we used h = 0 . 05 nm . We set τ = 0 . All model parameters were chosen as described in Sec . II , and analytic and numerical solutions were obtained as discussed in Secs . III and IV . membrane proteins are in close proximity to each other , bilayer thickness deformation zones of the same sign over - lap and the overall bilayer deformation footprint of the interacting proteins is strongly reduced compared to the large - d limit , resulting in strongly favorable thickness - mediated protein interactions . In contrast , for inter - mediate protein separations , the protein - induced bilayer thickness deformation proﬁles are out of phase , yielding substantial overlap of compressed and expanded bilayer regions . This results in frustration of bilayer thickness deformations , and produces weakly unfavorable protein interactions . As discussed in Sec . III , the analytic solution of bilayer thickness - mediated protein interactions in Eq . ( 18 ) is , in practice , only obtained up to some ﬁnite order n = N . While modes with n ≥ 1 are irrelevant at large pro - tein separations , modes with non - zero n are essential to correctly account for the thickness deformations induced by interacting proteins . To conﬁrm the validity of the truncated expansion in Eq . ( 18 ) , we compare the ana - lytic solution of thickness - mediated protein interactions to high - resolution numerical solutions obtained by FE and FD methods ( Fig . 8 ) . At low orders of the analytic solution , N = 3 and N = 5 , our analytic estimates of the thickness - mediated interaction energy reproduce the qualitative features of the numerical interaction poten - tials , but exceed the numerical results by several k B T . Increasing the order of the analytic solution to N = 7 and N = 11 , we obtain convergence of the analytic solu - tion even for small values of d . We ﬁnd that these high - order analytic solutions are in good quantitative agree - ment with the corresponding FE solution . The agreement between FE and high - order analytic 14 solutions is approximately independent of protein sep - aration [ Fig . 8 ( inset ) ] . In particular , FE and analytic approaches agree similarly well in the non - interacting regime , for which only zeroth - order modes of the analytic solution must be considered , and in the strongly inter - acting regime for which , in principle , and inﬁnite num - ber of higher - order modes should be considered in the analytic solution . This suggests that the FE and high - order analytic solutions correctly account for thickness - mediated protein interactions even at very small d . Fur - thermore , we ﬁnd that , in the strongly interacting regime , the discrepancy between FE and high - order analytic re - sults for the thickness deformation energy decreases ap - proximately quadratically with decreasing (cid:104) l edge (cid:105) [ blue dashed curve in Fig . 6 ( b ) ] , in agreement with the corre - sponding result obtained for non - interacting membrane proteins [ red solid curve in Fig . 6 ( b ) ] . While the results in Figs . 6 ( b ) and 8 were obtained with τ = 0 , we ﬁnd similar agreement between FE and high - order analytic solutions for ﬁnite membrane tensions . In contrast to the FE solution procedure , the discrep - ancy between FD and high - order analytic solutions tends to increase with decreasing d [ Fig . 8 ( inset ) ] . This can be understood by noting that , in the FD scheme , very small lattice spacings are required to resolve protein - induced lipid bilayer deformations in the strongly inter - acting regime . As in the case of non - interacting proteins ( red solid curve in Fig . 7 ) , the discrepancy between FD and high - order analytic results for the thickness defor - mation energy decreases approximately linearly with de - creasing lattice spacing ( blue dashed curve in Fig . 7 ) . As in Sec . V A this points to approximate enforcement of slope boundary conditions as the likely dominant source of error in the FD solutions . Moreover , Fig . 7 shows that , consistent with Fig . 8 , the FD scheme produces larger discrepancies with FE and high - order analytic so - lutions at smaller d than larger d , independent of the lat - tice spacing considered . For instance , for small d a too coarse lattice spacing h = 0 . 2 nm can yield errors in the thickness deformation energy > 2 k B T , while the same lattice spacing only produces errors < 0 . 4 k B T at large protein separations . In contrast , the convergence of FE and high - order analytic solutions with decreasing (cid:104) l edge (cid:105) is not diminished in the interacting regime compared to the non - interacting regime [ Fig . 6 ( b ) ] . VI . CROWN MODEL The cylinder model of integral membrane proteins [ 5 , 7 , 25 , 26 , 38 , 90 – 92 ] provides a beautiful “zeroth - order” description of thickness - mediated protein interac - tions , but is not able to capture the discrete symmetries and distinct hydrophobic shapes of membrane proteins suggested by membrane structural biology . As discussed in Sec . II B 2 , a straightforward way to account for ro - tational asymmetry of the hydrophobic surface of mem - brane proteins is to allow for angular variations in pro - 6 8 10 12 280 320 360 d ( nm ) G ( un i t s o f k B T ) ( ω 1 , ω 2 ) = ( 0 ◦ , 36 ◦ ) Analytic Finite elements Finite diﬀerences ( ω 1 , ω 2 ) = ( 0 ◦ , 0 ◦ ) Analytic Finite elements ( ω 1 , ω 2 ) = ( 0 ◦ , 24 ◦ ) Analytic Finite elements 6 12 0 1 d ( nm ) η G FIG . 9 : ( Color online ) Thickness deformation energy per pro - tein for two crown shapes , G , versus center - to - center protein distance , d , calculated analytically at N = 11 , and numeri - cally using FE and FD schemes , for the minus - minus conﬁg - uration [ ω 1 = 0 ◦ and ω 2 = 36 ◦ in Eq . ( 15 ) ] , the plus - minus conﬁguration [ ω 1 = 0 ◦ and ω 2 = 0 ◦ in Eq . ( 15 ) ] , and a conﬁgu - ration intermediate between the minus - minus and plus - minus conﬁgurations [ ω 1 = 0 ◦ and ω 2 = 24 ◦ in Eq . ( 15 ) ] . We only consider here FD solutions for the mirror - symmetric minus - minus protein conﬁguration . The inset shows the percentage diﬀerence in thickness deformation energy , η G in Eq . ( 54 ) , be - tween the analytic result at N = 11 and the corresponding results of the FE [ blue curves ; minus - minus ( solid ) , interme - diate ( short dashed ) , and plus - minus ( long dashed ) conﬁgura - tions ] and FD ( orange triangles with η G ≈ 1 . 2 % at d = 5 nm ) calculations . We used (cid:104) l edge (cid:105) ≈ 0 . 27 nm for the FE and h = 0 . 05 nm for the FD solutions , and set τ = 0 . All model parameters were chosen as described in Sec . II , and analytic and numerical solutions were obtained as discussed in Secs . III and IV . tein hydrophobic thickness while maintaining a circular protein cross section [ 46 ] , resulting in the crown model of membrane proteins [ Fig . 1 ( b ) ] . Angular variations in protein hydrophobic thickness yield rotationally asym - metric distributions of compression and expansion zones about the protein . For two or more such proteins in close enough proximity , the anisotropy of overlapping deforma - tion ﬁelds produces directionality of thickness - mediated protein interactions [ 46 ] , which is expected to aﬀect pro - tein organization and function . We used our analytic and numerical solution proce - dures to determine the thickness deformation energy as - sociated with two crown shapes in the “minus - minus conﬁguration” [ ω 1 = 0 ◦ and ω 2 = 36 ◦ in Eq . ( 15 ) ] , in which protein boundary regions with minimal hydropho - bic thickness face each other at the point of closest pro - tein edge - to - edge separation , in the “plus - minus conﬁgu - ration” [ ω 1 = 0 ◦ and ω 2 = 0 ◦ in Eq . ( 15 ) ; see Fig . 1 ( b ) ] , in which protein boundary regions with maximal and minimal hydrophobic thickness face each other at the point of closest protein edge - to - edge separation , and in a protein conﬁguration corresponding to ω 1 = 0 ◦ and ω 2 = 24 ◦ in Eq . ( 15 ) , which is intermediate between minus - minus and plus - minus conﬁgurations ( see Fig . 9 ) . We ﬁnd that , in the non - interacting regime , FE and exact analytic solutions are in good quantitative agree - 15 ment , with the discrepancy in thickness deformation en - ergy < 0 . 3 % for the parameter values used in Fig . 9 [ see Fig . 9 ( inset ) ] . In contrast , our FD solution yields more substantial discrepancies with the exact analytic solu - tion . We attribute this to the diﬃculty of accurately and unambiguously imposing complicated boundary con - ditions in the FD scheme . In the interacting regime , we ﬁnd that analytic , FE , and FD solutions predict the same basic qualitative prop - erties of bilayer thickness - mediated interactions between crown shapes ( Fig . 9 ) . Depending on relative protein orientation , thickness - mediated interactions can switch from being strongly favorable to being strongly unfavor - able at small protein separations . In particular , when the periodic undulations of the thickness deformations induced by the two proteins are in phase in the mem - brane region separating the two proteins , as in the case of the minus - minus conﬁguration in Fig . 9 , similar patterns of protein - induced compression and expansion zones of the lipid bilayer overlap for small d , yielding strongly fa - vorable interactions . In contrast , when the thickness un - dulations induced by the two proteins are out of phase , as in the case of the plus - minus conﬁguration in Fig . 9 , there is substantial overlap of out - of - phase compression and expansion zones for small d , resulting in frustration of bilayer thickness deformations and strongly unfavor - able bilayer thickness - mediated interactions . As the rel - ative protein orientation is changed continuously from in - phase to out - of - phase conﬁgurations , the interaction potentials change smoothly [ 46 ] from being favorable to being unfavorable at small d which , as in the case of the intermediate conﬁguration in Fig . 9 , can produce a min - imum in the thickness - mediated interaction energy at a characteristic protein separation . On a quantitative level , we ﬁnd that our FE results on bilayer thickness - mediated interactions between crown shapes are generally in good quantitative agreement with our analytic solution ( Fig . 9 ) . In contrast , the FD solu - tion procedure yields more substantial discrepancies with our analytic results . In particular , analytic and FE solu - tions are in good quantitative agreement for all conﬁgu - rations in Fig . 9 with d > 5 . 3 nm , with a discrepancy in thickness deformation energy < 0 . 5 % . We ﬁnd a similar level of quantitative agreement between analytic and FE solutions even for the smallest protein separations con - sidered for the minus - minus conﬁguration in Fig . 9 . The discrepancy between analytic and FE results is most pronounced at very small d in the strongly un - favorable regime of bilayer thickness - mediated interac - tions , d < 5 . 3 nm , for the plus - minus and intermediate conﬁgurations in Fig . 9 , where the interaction energy di - verges . However , even in this regime the percentage dif - ference between analytic and FE results is < 18 % for the plus - minus and intermediate conﬁgurations in Fig . 9 , for which the thickness deformation energy can exceed G ≈ 1000 k B T for the smallest value d ≈ 5 nm we allow here . We ﬁnd that in the strongly unfavorable regime d < 5 . 3 nm the magnitude of the gradient of u 0 . 1 1 10 10 − 2 10 − 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 ∼h l edge i 1 ∼h l edge i 2 h l edge i ( nm ) η u η ∇ 2 u ( a ) 0 . 1 1 10 10 − 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 ∼h l edge i 2 h l edge i ( nm ) η G ( b ) d = 14 nm d = 5 nm FIG . 10 : ( Color online ) Comparison of analytic and FE so - lutions for crown shapes .

III and IV . can exceed (cid:107)∇ u (cid:107) = 3 . The maximum value of (cid:107)∇ u (cid:107) in the strongly interacting regime is therefore substantially greater than the maximum magnitude of the gradient of bilayer thickness deformations ≈ 1 in the non - interacting regime of the crown shapes considered here , which we take to induce large gradients of the thickness deforma - tion ﬁeld so as to test the mathematical limits of ap - plicability of our analytic and numerical solution proce - dures ( see Sec . II B 2 ) . The more pronounced discrepancy between FE and analytic results in the strongly unfavor - able regime of bilayer thickness - mediated interactions be - tween crown shapes arises because , in this regime , bilayer thickness deformations show a strong variation over the small membrane region separating the two proteins . High accuracy in the strongly unfavorable regime of thickness - mediated interactions therefore requires highly reﬁned 16 0 . 01 0 . 1 10 − 1 10 0 10 1 ∼ h 1 h ( nm ) η G d = 14 nm d = 5 nm FIG . 11 : ( Color online ) Percentage diﬀerence between ana - lytic and FD results for the thickness deformation energy per protein , η G in Eq .

III and IV . meshes in the FE scheme and , to capture pronounced angular variations in the thickness deformation ﬁeld , a large value of N in the analytic approach . Following Sec . V we quantify the discrepancy between numerical and analytic solutions by systematically in - creasing the spatial resolution of the numerical solutions . As in the case of cylindrical membrane proteins we ﬁnd that , for the FE solution procedure , the errors in thick - ness deformations and thickness deformation energy de - crease approximately quadratically with decreasing aver - age edge size of the FE mesh , while the error in curva - ture deformations decreases approximately linearly with (cid:104) l edge (cid:105) ( see Fig . 10 ) . We ﬁnd similar scaling of the dis - crepancy between FE and analytic solutions with (cid:104) l edge (cid:105) in the interacting and non - interacting regimes , as well as for zero and ﬁnite membrane tensions . As for cylindrical membrane proteins , the error in the thickness deformation energy obtained from the FD so - lution procedure decreases approximately linearly with decreasing lattice spacing in the interacting and non - interacting regimes ( see Fig . 11 ) , which again points to approximate enforcement of slope boundary conditions as the likely dominant source of error in the FD solu - tions . Furthermore , Fig . 11 suggests that , similar to the case of cylindrical membrane proteins , the FD scheme generally produces larger discrepancies with high - order analytic solutions at smaller d than larger d . In contrast , the convergence of FE and high - order analytic solutions is not diminished in the interacting regime compared to the non - interacting regime [ Fig . 10 ( b ) ] . Finally , compari - son of Figs . 6 and 10 , and Figs . 7 and 11 , shows that , for a given spatial resolution , the discrepancy between FE and FD solutions and the analytic solution is more pro - nounced for crown shapes than for cylindrical membrane proteins . VII . CLOVER - LEAF MODEL The clover - leaf model of integral membrane proteins discussed in Sec . II B 3 can be used to capture non - circular bilayer - protein boundary curves [ Fig . 1 ( c ) ] , and provides a generalization of the cylinder model of mem - brane proteins complementary to the crown model . In particular , to model the discrete symmetries of integral membrane proteins suggested by membrane structural biology , the clover - leaf model allows for periodic mod - ulations in the shape of the hydrophobic cross section of membrane proteins . As a result , the bilayer thick - ness deformations induced by clover - leaf proteins show a characteristic pattern of compression and expansion zones about the protein [ 88 ] , which provides a simple description of the eﬀect of protein shape and oligomeric state on lipid bilayer thickness deformations . Further - more , for two clover - leaf proteins in close enough prox - imity , bilayer thickness - mediated interactions are direc - tional [ 46 , 47 , 89 , 97 ] and bear characteristic signatures of protein shape , symmetry , and orientation . To compare our analytic and numerical solutions in the case of clover - leaf shapes , we consider the bilayer thick - ness deformation energies associated with two clover - leaf proteins in the “face - on conﬁguration” [ ω 1 = 0 ◦ and ω 2 = 36 ◦ in Eq . ( 16 ) ] and the “tip - on conﬁguration” [ ω 1 = 36 ◦ and ω 2 = 0 ◦ in Eq . ( 16 ) ] using analytic , FE , and FD solution procedures [ see Fig . 12 ( a ) ] . We ﬁnd that the thickness deformation energies obtained using our FE and FD solution procedures are in agreement within the numerical accuracy of the numerical solution schemes . In contrast , the thickness deformation energies obtained via the perturbative analytic solution procedure diﬀer substantially from the FE and FD solutions , in the non - interacting as well as interacting regimes in Fig . 12 ( a ) . Some discrepancy between analytic and numerical re - sults is to be expected , given that somewhat diﬀerent boundary value problems are solved in the perturbative analytic and numerical approaches , with the analytic so - lution only being ﬁrst order in the perturbation param - eter (cid:15) i in Eq . ( 16 ) . This produces a systematic error in the thickness deformation energy obtained through the perturbative analytic approach , which yields disagree - ment between perturbative analytic and numerical so - lution procedures even in the non - interacting regime . As far as bilayer thickness - mediated interactions be - tween clover - leaf shapes are concerned [ see Fig . 12 ( b ) ] , the discrepancy between analytic and numerical results is most pronounced at small d , where the interaction potentials obtained from perturbative analytic and nu - merical approaches can diﬀer by > 1 k B T . This can be understood intuitively by noting that the analytic calcu - lation of thickness - mediated interactions between clover - leaf shapes relies on a perturbative mapping of clover - leaf boundary curves with constant hydrophobic thickness onto circular boundary curves with varying hydrophobic thickness [ see Eqs . ( 33 ) – ( 36 ) ] . We use here a ﬁrst - order perturbative mapping , which is expected to become in - 17 8 10 12 14 26 30 34 38 ( ω 1 , ω 2 ) = ( 0 ◦ , 36 ◦ ) Analytic Finite elements Finite diﬀerences ( ω 1 , ω 2 ) = ( 36 ◦ , 0 ◦ ) Analytic Finite elements Finite diﬀerences ( a ) d ( nm ) G ( un i t s o f k B T ) 8 10 12 14 - 4 - 2 0 1 7 14 - 0 . 5 0 1 d ( nm ) ∆ G i n t ( k B T ) ( b ) d ( nm ) G i n t ( un i t s o f k B T ) FIG . 12 : ( Color online ) Thickness deformation energy of clover - leaf shapes .

All model parameters were chosen as described in Sec . II , and analytic and numerical solutions were obtained as discussed in Secs . III and IV . creasingly inaccurate at small protein separations since , as d is being decreased , the structure of thickness de - formations in close proximity to the clover - leaf proteins comes to dominate the interaction energy . We therefore attribute the disagreement between analytic and numer - ical approaches in Fig . 12 ( b ) to shortcomings of the an - alytic approach . Note , however , that the ﬁrst - order per - turbative analytic solution and the corresponding numer - ical solutions yield the same basic scenario for the com - petition between the diﬀerent orientations of pentameric clover - leaf shapes considered in Fig . 12 . Indeed , similar agreement between ﬁrst - order perturbative and numer - ical approaches is obtained for other clover - leaf shapes and orientations [ 46 , 47 ] , which suggests that the ﬁrst - order perturbative approach can accurately capture the directionality of thickness - mediated interactions between integral membrane proteins with clover - leaf shapes . VIII . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS A wide range of experiments indicate [ 2 – 9 , 27 – 30 ] that protein - induced lipid bilayer thickness deformations can play a crucial role in the regulation of protein func - tion through bilayer material properties and bilayer - mediated protein interactions . Cell membranes are gen - erally crowded with membrane proteins [ 3 , 7 , 21 – 23 ] , suggesting that the protein center - to - center distance d is typically small in vivo , while modern structural biology suggests a rich picture of membrane protein shape with great diversity in the oligomeric states and symmetries of membrane proteins . Motivated by these experimen - tal observations , we have developed a combined analytic and numerical framework [ 46 , 47 , 88 , 89 , 97 ] which allows prediction of the protein - induced lipid bilayer thickness deformations implied by the classic model in Eq . ( 3 ) for arbitrary d and the protein shapes suggested by struc - tural studies . Our analytic solution procedure , which is based on Refs . [ 38 – 42 , 49 , 50 ] , allows exact solutions of the protein - induced lipid bilayer thickness deforma - tion ﬁeld and elastic thickness deformation energy for proteins with constant or varying hydrophobic thickness in the ( strongly ) interacting as well as non - interacting regimes , provided that the proteins have circular trans - membrane cross sections . Through a perturbative ap - proach , our analytic solution scheme can also account for non - circular protein cross sections . Following simi - lar steps as in Refs . [ 46 , 49 , 50 ] , our analytic solution procedure is readily applied [ 97 ] to calculate curvature - mediated protein interactions at arbitrary protein sepa - rations . The exact analytic solutions described here are in ex - cellent quantitative agreement with our numerical solu - tions for arbitrary protein orientations and arbitrary d with the exception of the strongly unfavorable regime of bilayer thickness - mediated interactions , for which the interaction energy diverges as the edge - to - edge protein separation approaches zero . We regard this regime as being of limited physical signiﬁcance because , for pro - teins of distinct hydrophobic thickness , the leading - order model in Eq . ( 3 ) is expected to break down at small d due to the large gradients of protein - induced lipid bi - layer deformations in the bilayer region separating the two proteins . In principle , higher - order analytic solutions than those considered here could be developed to access thickness - mediated interactions in this regime . For pro - teins of non - circular cross section , our comparisons be - tween analytic and numerical solution procedures show that the ﬁrst - order perturbative solution can accurately capture the dependence of the thickness deformation en - ergy on protein oligomeric state [ 47 , 88 ] , as well as the directionality of bilayer thickness - mediated protein in - teractions [ 46 , 47 , 89 ] . However , the ﬁrst - order pertur - bative approach does not yield the exact value of the 18 thickness deformation energy . The discrepancy between our perturbative analytic and numerical solutions of bi - layer thickness - mediated protein interactions is most pro - nounced at small d , where the perturbative analytic ap - proach is expected to break down . We have developed both FD and FE solution schemes to numerically calculate the lipid bilayer thickness defor - mations induced by membrane proteins . The FD scheme has the advantage of being conceptually simple and rel - atively straightforward to implement . We ﬁnd that our FD scheme accurately accounts for the lipid bilayer thick - ness deformations induced by cylindrical membrane pro - teins in the non - interacting regime and can also capture , albeit with less accuracy , bilayer thickness - mediated in - teractions between cylindrical membrane proteins . How - ever , the convergence of the numerical solutions to the exact analytic solutions is slower for the FD scheme than for the FE scheme , most likely due to errors in the FD slope boundary conditions at the protein surface . Fur - thermore , we ﬁnd that the FD solution procedure can introduce substantial numerical errors for non - cylindrical membrane proteins . These errors are particularly pro - nounced in the interacting regime . In contrast , we ﬁnd that the FE scheme described here yields rapid numerical convergence for all available exact analytic solutions of the minima of Eq . ( 3 ) [ 38 , 46 , 88 ] . The convergence properties of the FE scheme do not seem to be diminished substantially in the interacting regime compared to the non - interacting regime of bilayer thickness - mediated protein interactions , or by compli - cated boundary shapes and boundary conditions . The combined presence of both ﬁrst and second derivatives in the energy in Eq . ( 3 ) places special demands on the FE formulation . In particular , while standard Lagrange interpolation functions [ 108 ] are adequate to compute the thickness stretch and gradient terms in Eq . ( 3 ) , they fail to produce conforming curvatures at element inter - faces [ 109 ] . Our FE solution procedure overcomes this challenge by combining [ 47 , 89 ] Lagrange shape func - tions for the thickness stretch and gradient terms with the DKT method [ 110 , 111 ] for curvature deformations . The resulting FE approach is computationally eﬃcient and allows accurate solutions of the complicated bound - ary value problems posed by many interacting membrane proteins . Indeed , we have shown previously [ 47 , 89 ] that our FE approach permits calculation of directional thickness - mediated protein interactions in systems com - posed of hundreds of integral membrane proteins for arbi - trary protein separations and orientations using protein shapes suggested by membrane structural biology . The combined analytic and numerical framework de - scribed here shows that the shape of integral membrane proteins , and resulting structure of lipid bilayer thickness deformations , can play a crucial role in the regulation of protein function by lipid bilayers [ 47 , 88 ] , and that bilayer thickness - mediated interactions between integral membrane proteins are strongly directional and depen - dent on protein shape [ 46 , 47 , 89 , 97 ] . Taken together , our results suggest that , in addition to bilayer - protein hy - drophobic mismatch [ 2 – 9 , 27 – 30 ] , protein shape may be a crucial determinant of membrane protein regulation by lipid bilayers and bilayer - mediated protein interactions . The classic model of protein - induced lipid bilayer thickness deformations in Eq . ( 3 ) and modiﬁcations thereof have been found to capture the basic experimen - tal phenomenology of bilayer - protein interactions in a wide range of experimental systems [ 4 – 11 , 24 – 28 , 31 , 38 – 47 , 81 – 83 , 88 – 97 ] , only involve parameters which can be measured directly in experiments , and are simple enough to allow analytic solutions . Analogous models have been formulated [ 7 , 48 ] to describe protein - induced curva - ture deformations [ 49 – 64 ] and ﬂuctuation - mediated in - teractions [ 49 , 61 – 68 ] . In general , thickness - , curvature - , and ﬂuctuation - mediated interactions all contribute to bilayer - mediated interactions between integral mem - brane proteins , but the relative strengths of these inter - actions depend on the speciﬁc experimental system under consideration . In addition to bilayer - mediated interac - tions , membrane proteins may , in principle , also inter - act via electrostatic forces . However , electrostatic inter - actions in aqueous environments are generally screened [ 117 , 118 ] and charged protein residues are typically ex - cluded from the transmembrane regions of membrane proteins [ 119 ] . The model of protein - induced lipid bilayer thick - ness deformations in Eq . ( 3 ) and the corresponding “zeroth - order” models [ 49 – 68 ] capturing curvature - and ﬂuctuation - mediated protein interactions absorb the molecular details of lipids and membrane proteins into eﬀective material parameters . To provide a more de - tailed description of bilayer - protein interactions , a num - ber of extensions and reﬁnements of these models have been developed [ 44 , 45 , 69 – 86 ] . For instance , the eﬀect of bilayer - protein interactions on the elastic properties of lipid bilayers can be captured [ 44 , 81 , 82 , 86 ] by allowing for spatial variations in the values of the elastic bilayer parameters . Furthermore , the microscopic roughness of lipid bilayers due to area ﬂuctuations can aﬀect [ 70 , 71 ] protein - induced lipid bilayer deformations . These model reﬁnements yield bilayer thickness deformation proﬁles which are quantitatively but not qualitatively diﬀerent from those implied by Eq . ( 3 ) [ see , for instance , Fig . 5 ( a ) ] . However , additional structural properties of the lipid bilayer , such as lipid tilt [ 72 – 78 ] , may have a more sub - stantial eﬀect on bilayer - mediated protein interactions . Moreover , integral membrane proteins may tilt to reduce hydrophobic mismatch , as suggested by Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations [ 120 , 121 ] . Tilt - ing of membrane proteins is expected to be most pro - nounced for small membrane proteins with only a sin - gle transmembrane α - helix . While protein tilting gen - erally competes with protein - induced lipid bilayer thick - ness deformations as a mechanism for alleviating bilayer - protein hydrophobic mismatch , experiments have sug - gested [ 122 , 123 ] that protein tilting is in general too weak to fully oﬀset a hydrophobic mismatch between 19 membrane proteins and the surrounding lipid bilayer . In this article we have focused on bilayer thickness - mediated interactions between two integral membrane proteins . In general , more than two membrane proteins are expected to interact in the crowded membrane envi - ronments provided by living cells . We have shown previ - ously [ 89 ] that , in contrast to curvature - and ﬂuctuation - mediated protein interactions [ 51 , 52 , 55 , 61 , 63 , 64 ] , bilayer thickness - mediated protein interactions are ap - proximately pairwise additive , at least for large enough protein separations . For small protein separations , non - pairwise contributions to bilayer thickness - mediated in - teractions between integral membrane proteins can mod - ify the interaction strength by > 1 k B T [ 89 ] . However , except in special cases [ 89 ] , non - pairwise contributions to bilayer thickness - mediated protein interactions do not al - ter how bilayer thickness - mediated interactions vary with the shape and arrangement of proteins . The approximate pairwise additivity of bilayer thickness - mediated protein interactions presents a considerable simpliﬁcation [ 89 ] for the mathematical analysis of systems composed of many interacting integral membrane proteins . Recent breakthroughs in superresolution light mi - croscopy and electron cryo - tomography have revealed that integral membrane proteins can form large clus - ters with intricate translational and orientational pro - tein ordering , which provides [ 2 – 9 , 15 , 16 , 124 , 125 ] a general mechanism for cells to modulate protein function through cooperative interactions and local modiﬁcation of bilayer mechanical properties . But , to date , the phys - ical mechanisms giving rise to the observed lattice ar - chitectures and collective functions of membrane protein clusters remain largely unknown . The directionality of bilayer thickness - mediated protein interactions implied by the observed protein structures presents one possible physical mechanism for membrane protein organization and collective function . Such directional interactions can yield [ 46 , 47 , 89 , 97 ] ordering of integral membrane pro - teins , which is also consistent with molecular dynamics simulations [ 84 , 95 , 126 , 127 ] . The combined analytic and numerical framework we have discussed here allows calculation of the lipid bilayer - mediated protein interac - tions implied by bilayer elasticity theory [ 32 – 43 ] for the protein shapes suggested by structural studies at arbi - trary protein separations and orientations . Our frame - work thus presents a step towards a general physical the - ory of how directional bilayer - mediated protein interac - tions aﬀect the molecular structure , organization , and biological function of proteins in the crowded membrane environments provided by living cells .
