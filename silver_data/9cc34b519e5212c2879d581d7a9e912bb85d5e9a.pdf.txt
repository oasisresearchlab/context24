CDC42 - INTERACTING PROTEIN FAMILY ADAPTORS REGULATE ENDOCYTOSIS , MEMBRANE TRAFFICKING , MIGRATION , AND INVASION IN CANCER CELLS by Jinghui Hu A thesis submitted to the Department of Biochemistry In conformity with the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy Queen’s University Kingston , Ontario , Canada ( August , 2010 ) Copyright ©Jinghui Hu , 2010 ii Abstract Timely and spatially controlled endosomal trafficking and signaling is important for cell proliferation , directed cell migration , and cell invasion , which are frequently misregulated in cancer cells . Cdc42 - interacting protein - 4 ( CIP4 ) family adaptors promote endocytosis by inducing membrane invaginations via their Fer / CIP4 Homology - Bin / Amphyphysin / Rvs ( F - BAR ) domains , coupled with activation of the actin assembly machinery to promote vesicle fusion or motility . My thesis focuses on defining the roles of CIP4 , and a related protein , Transducer of Cdc42 - mediated actin assembly - 1 ( Toca - 1 ) , in regulating Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) endocytosis , EGFR trafficking , cancer cell motility , and invasion . In Chapter 2 , I show that CIP4 and Toca - 1 localize to early endosomes and promote EGFR trafficking from early endosomes to lysosomes for degradation , thus limiting extracellular signal - regulated kinase signaling from early endosomes and proliferation of A431 carcinoma cells . In Chapter 3 , I provide novel evidence that depletion of Toca - 1 results in defects in actin - based lamellipodial protrusions that are required for cell motility . The cause of these defects may relate to altered recruitment of the Abelson - interactor - 1 and its effector Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin - homologous protein to the lamellipodia in A431 cells depleted of Toca - 1 . Results in Chapter 4 identify CIP4 as a negative regulator of breast cancer invasiveness downstream of Src protein - tyrosine kinase . Src is a potent inducer of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) - degrading structures called invadopodia that function in tissue invasion by cancer cells . I found that CIP4 is a Src substrate that localizes to Src - induced invadopodia in MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells . Interestingly , depletion of CIP4 results in enhanced ECM degradation , invadopodia formation , and invasiveness compared to control cells . Thus , CIP4 and Toca - 1 are multifaceted regulators of EGFR downregulation , EGF - induced cell motility , and Src - induced cell invasion . iii Co - Authorship Chapter 2 : Most of this work was published in Cellular Signaling ( 2009 ) , in which I was first author , followed by the following co - authors : Flavia Troglio , Alka Mukhopadhyay , Stephanie Everingham , Ester Kwok , Giorgio Scita and Andrew W . B . Craig . I designed and performed most of the experiments , except the following : EGFR endocytosis assay using 125 I - EGF , TIRF microscopy , and CIP4 / Toca - 1 co - localization with Rab5 Q79L in HeLa cells ( all performed by Flavia Troglio in Giorgio Scita’s lab in Istituto FIRC di Oncologia Molecolare ( IFOM ) ) ; liposome sendimentation assays were done by Stephanie Everingham , and F - BAR domain mutant modeling by Ester Kwok . I analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript . Editing was done by Andrew W Craig . Chapter 3 : This chapter has been written as a submitted manuscript in which I am first author , followed by Alka Mukhopadhyay and Andrew W . Craig . I performed the majority of the experiments , with the following exceptions : Alka Mukhopadhyay generated stable Toca - 1 knock - down cell lines , performed some of the wound healing and co - immunoprecipitation assays . I drafted the chapter / manuscript , and editing was done by Andrew W . Craig .

It is a class of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell division and loss of check points for maintaining genomic stability [ 1 ] . In the later stages of cancer progression , cancer cells spread to other tissues , either by direct invasion into adjacent or implantation into distant sites by metastasis , which is a process involving the transport of cancer cells through the blood stream or lymphatic system , to colonize a new and sometimes distant tissue . Since metastasis is the leading cause of cancer death [ 2 ] , early detection and removal or treatment of primary tumours is key to prevent the high levels of morbidity linked to metastasis . Cell migration and tissue invasion are important steps in cancer metastasis [ 3 ] . Aberrant signal transduction downstream of receptors such as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) can cause misregulated cell proliferation , migration , and invasion that are crucial in cancer progression . Elevated expression of EGFR or its co - receptor avian erythroblastosis oncogene B2 ( ErbB2 ) / Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 ( Her2 ) receptor are frequently observed in cancer [ 4 ] . 1 . 2 EGFR signaling and endocytosis 1 . 2 . 1 EGFR signaling Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) is a powerful mitogen for epithelial cells and plays important roles during embryonic development and in wound healing responses [ 5 ] . However , aberrant expression , mutation of EGFR or the related ErbB2 / Her2 receptor is linked to tumorigenesis , angiogenesis , and metastasis [ 6 ] . Preclinical and clinical studies have established that EGFR and HER2 are essential players in cancer , especially in carcinomas , breast cancer , 2 non - small cell lung cancer , and brain gliomas [ 7 ] , which make them important targets in treating cancer . Monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR ( cetuximab and panitumumab ) and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( gefitinib , erlotinib , and lapatinib ) are now used clinically for treating squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck , breast cancer , advanced colorectal cancer , advanced non - small - cell lung cancer , and pancreatic cancer [ 8 - 12 ] . Binding of EGF to EGFR causes dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR within the cytoplasmic tail which recruits signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) doamins like the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , Grb2 , Shc , and signaling proteins containing phosphotyrosine binding ( PTB ) domains like Shc . This leads to activation of intracellular signaling pathways controlling growth and survival , including Protein Kinase B ( PKB / Akt ) and Mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) [ 6 ] . EGFR signaling also leads to dramatic changes in the cytoskeleton via activation of the Rho family GTPases , including cell division control protein 42 ( Cdc42 ) , Rac , and Rho [ 6 ] ( Fig . 1 . 1 ) . Rho GTPases are important regulators of actin cytoskeleton reorganization that act as a molecular switch , cycling between the GTP - bound form that signals to effector proteins , and the GDP - bound form that does not bind effectors . Rho GTPases are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) that cause dissociation of GDP and subsequent binding of GTP , and inactivated by GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) that promote the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho GTPase and returns them to the inactive GDP - bound form [ 13 ] . Activation of numerous types of cell surface receptors including EGFR results in changes in Rho family GTPase signaling via recruitment of specific GEFs and GAPs [ 13 ] . Cdc42 and Rac regulate cell protrusions at the leading edge of migrating cells , while Rho promotes retraction of the cell body at the trailing edge [ 14 - 16 ] . The 3 Figure 1 . 1 . EGFR signaling and endocytosis . Binding of EGF to EGFR induces dimerization and autophosphorylation at sites recognized by signaling proteins containing SH2 domains ( eg . PI3K and Grb2 ) that activate downstream pathways , including Akt and MAPKs . Src tyrosine kinase and Rho GTPases are also activated downstream of EGFR . Src can phosphorylate Vav2 to promote GEF activity towards Cdc42 and Rac . Cdc42 promotes filopodia formation , while Cdc42 and Rac promote lamellipodia formation at the leading edge of motile cells . EGF induces EGFR internalization via CME and NCE ( eg macropinocytosis ) . F - BAR and BAR domain - containing proteins promote membrane invaginations , localized actin polymerization , and dynamin recruitment to CCPs . Actin branching and dynamin promote membrane scission to form CCVs . Vesicles containing EGFR formed from both CME and NCE fuse with early endosomes , which is Rab5 dependent . Early endosomes are enriched in PI ( 3 ) P that recruits endosomal protesin ( eg . EEA1 ) . Some EGFR recycles back from early endosomes to the plasma membrane via a Rab4 pathway . Early endosomes containing EGFR mature to late endosomes / MVbs regulated by Rab7 . Early endosome trafficking and fusion are regulated by actin aseembly . Receptors in late endosomes fuse with lysosomes , leading to protein degradation . Internalized EGFR continues to signal from early endosomes and late endosomes , leading to sustained activation of cell growth pathways ( eg . Akt , MAPKs ) . 4 contributions of Cdc42 , Rac , and Rho signaling to regulate the actin cytoskeleton will be discussed in more detail below . 1 . 2 . 2 Endocytosis and trafficking of EGFR Binding of EGF to EGFR not only leads to activation of EGFR signaling from the plasma membrane , but also to the internalization of EGFR [ 17 ] . Endocytosis is initiated by membrane invagination , followed by membrane scission and formation of endocytic vesicles [ 18 ] . Endocytosis is classified into clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) and non - clathrin mediated endocytosis ( NCE ) [ 18 ] . The mode of EGFR endocytosis depends on cell type and ligand concentration employed for these studies . At low concentrations of ligand , EGFR is primarily internalized via CME , while at high concentrations of ligand , the NCE mechanisms are the major route of internalization and downregulation [ 19 , 20 ] . These include macropinocytosis and circular dorsal ruffles that can rapidly internalize and downregulate activated EGFR in some cell types [ 19 , 20 ] . EGF stimulation of cells induces macropinocytosis [ 21 - 23 ] , an inducible NCE mechanism involving internalization of an extracellular fluids and the associated membrane and receptors therein [ 18 ] . Macropinocytosis can be activated by ADP - ribosylation factor 6 ( Arf6 ) , Rac , Ras , and Src , and is often coupled with membrane ruffling [ 24 ] . With many studies focused on CME , the mechanism of CME has become increasingly understood . At the sites of plasma membrane that are enriched with phospholipids , such as phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) , cargo - binding protein AP2 and clathrin are recruited to form clathrin coated pits ( CCPs ) . AP2 binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and ensures the proper localization of clathrin [ 25 ] . Specific adaptor proteins with membrane sculpting domains are recruited to promote membrane invagination . The Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) domain superfamily of adaptor proteins play key roles in generating and stabilizing inward curvature of 5 the membrane [ 26 ] . Membrane invaginations from the CCPs are stabilized by branched actin filaments ( F - actin ) , likely via the recruitment of actin assembly proteins like Neural Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein ( N - WASP ) to the SH3 domains of BAR and Fer / Cdc42 - interacting protein 4 ( CIP4 ) Homology ( FCH ) - BAR ( F - BAR ) adaptor proteins [ 26 ] . The scission of membrane invaginations into clathrin coated vesicles ( CCVs ) is triggered by recruitment of dynamin , a large GTPase that has “pinchase” activity [ 27 ] . Dynamin recruitment to CCPs is potentially mediated by direct binding to SH3 domains of BAR proteins such as sorting nexin - 9 ( SNX - 9 ) or F - BAR adaptor proteins such as formin - binding protein 17 ( FBP17 ) ( discussed in more detail below ) ( Fig . 1 . 1 ) . Once internalized , EGFR is trafficked through the cytoplasm in different endosomal compartments regulated by Rab proteins . Rab proteins are small GTPases in the Ras superfamily that regulate vesicle docking and membrane fusion in endocytosis or exocytosis pathways . The Rab family is composed of multiple members , each having specific GEFs and GAPs , which reside in particular organelle membranes [ 28 , 29 ] . Endocytic vesicles containing EGFR derived from both CME and NCE pathways fuse with early endosomes ( also called sorting endosomes ) , and this is regulated by Rab5 . From early endosomes , EGFR can either recycle back to plasma membrane via recycling endosomes regulated by Rab4 or traffic to late endosomes / multivesicular bodies ( MVbs ) regulated by Rab7 . MVbs are characterized by the presence of intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) , Cargos destined for degradation are incorporated into ILVs . Late endosomes mature into lysosomes that carry proteolytic enzymes which degrade cargo such as EGFR [ 30 ] . Rab5 mainly resides in CCVs and early endosomes . In the early endocytic pathway , Rab5 helps fusion of CCVs with early endosomes and homotypic early endosome fusion [ 31 ] . It also regulates early endosome motility 6 along microtubules [ 28 , 29 ] . Rab5 recruits type III PI3K hVPS34 , the mammalian homologue of yeast Vps34p / Vps15p , that preferentially phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylinositol - 3’ phosphate ( PI ( 3 ) P ) [ 32 ] , which makes early endosomes a compartment enriched with PI ( 3 ) P . EEA1 is an important Rab5 effector that mediates tethering and docking of early endosomes [ 31 ] . It has four structural domains targeting it to early endosomes , two FYVE domains , which are zinc - fingers that specifically bind to PI ( 3 ) P , and two Rab5 - binding domains . EEA1 has been regarded as a marker of early endosomes ( Fig . 1 . 1 ) . 1 . 2 . 3 Endosome trafficking and signaling Endocytosis has been commonly regarded as a way to attenuate signaling by targeting activated receptors such as EGFR for degradation in lysosomes . However , increasing evidence suggests that internalized receptors continue to signal from endosomes after being internalized [ 33 , 34 ] . The endocytic vesicles form a dynamic network of cellular compartments that actively and tightly control the timing , space , amplitude , and specificity of the signaling . The endosomal signaling has been shown to play a more important role on signal propagation and amplification than the signaling initiated from the plasma membrane [ 34 ] . Shortly after EGF treatment of cells , the majority of activated EGFR and downstream signaling proteins ( e . g . , p85 , Shc , Grb2 ) were found on early endosomes , but not on the plasma membrane [ 35 ] . Inhibiting EGFR internalization by expressing a dominant negative mutant of dynamin results in decreased activation of extracellular signal - regulated kinases ( ERK ) MAPK , despite increased levels of activated EGFR at the plasma membrane [ 36 ] . Expressing a constitutively activate mutant of Rab5 leads to formation of enlarged early endosomes , and prolonged ERK activation and cell proliferation downstream of EGFR [ 37 ] . Endosomal EGFR can trigger the sustained activation of ERK and 7 AKT / PKB pathways needed to drive cell proliferation , migration , and invasion . Thus , defects in endocytic trafficking of receptors such as EGFR can lead to accumulation of these signaling molecules in the wrong compartments , and result in aberrant cell growth signals which may lead to cancer [ 38 , 39 ] . Endocytosis also plays a key role in regulating cell migration by altering the subcellular localization of receptors and signaling proteins that affect this process [ 40 ] . For example , spatially regulated Rac delivery to lamellipodia by membrane trafficking is important for directional cell migration [ 41 ] . 1 . 3 Mechanisms controlling cell migration Directional cell migration is an essential cellular process for embryonic development , wound healing in epithelia , immune response , and tissue remodeling [ 42 ] . A gradient of chemotactic factors such as EGF and platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) can trigger directional migration of cells expressing EGF or PDGF receptors . Many invasive cancers express elevated levels of growth factor receptors , which make these cells more receptive to chemotactic signals [ 43 , 44 ] . On 2D surfaces , cell migration takes 4 steps : membrane protrusion at the leading edge , adhesion to the substratum , retraction of the trailing edge , and de - adhesion [ 42 ] . Actin cytoskeleton reorganization , especially the localized F - actin polymerization underneath the plasma membrane in the leading edge of the cells , is essential for migration by providing the major force for cell protrusion formation and cell movement . There are two types of protrusions formed in the leading edge , filopodia and lamellipodia that differ in the arrangement of actin structures . The filopodium is a finger - like protrusion that has parallel and bundled actin filaments [ 45 ] . Formation of filopodia involves activation of Cdc42 and Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein ( WASP ) / N - WASP [ 45 , 46 ] , actin nucleators such as formins [ 47 ] , and actin bundling proteins 8 such as Fascin [ 48 ] . In contrast , lamellipodia are sheet - like protrusions of membrane supported by an extensive network of branched actin [ 49 , 50 ] . Branched actin is generated by the Actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex . Arp2 / 3 consists of 7 subunits that nucleate growth of new actin filaments at a characteristic 70º angle from preexisting actin filaments [ 51 ] . Cdc42 and Rac GTPases localize to lamellipodia and promote actin branching via promoting Arp2 / 3 binding activity of WASP / N - WASP and WASP family verprolin - homologous ( WAVE ) proteins , respectively [ 52 ] in EGF treated COS - 7 and A431 cells . These pathways are discussed in more detail below . 1 . 3 . 1 Cdc42 signaling and cellular regulation Cdc42 GTPase regulates cell growth , differentiation , polarity , and migration [ 53 , 54 ] . A variety of extracellular stimuli including EGF activate Cdc42 [ 15 ] . As with all small GTPases , activation of Cdc42 is tightly regulated in time and space [ 55 ] . Cdc42 activity is regulated by GEFs ( eg . Vavs [ 15 ] , Tuba [ 56 ] ) , and GAPs ( eg . RhoGAP - interacting with CIP4 homologues ( RICH - 1 ) [ 57 ] ) ; Cdc42 localization is regulated by Rho - GDP Dissociation Inhibitor ( RhoGDI ) , which binds to activated Cdc42 and regulates the trafficking of activated Cdc42 to different cellular compartments ( e . g . Golgi apparatus ) [ 53 ] . Cdc42 interacts with a host of effector proteins including lipid and protein kinases , ( e . g . PI3K , p21 - activated protein kinase ( PAK ) , S6K , activated Cdc42 - associated kinase and non - kinase targets ( e . g . WASP family proteins , PAR6 , Cool - Cbl ) that control cytoskeletal organization , cell polarity , and endocytosis [ 53 ] . Cdc42 binds to multiple actin nucleation factors and drives actin polymerization and membrane protrusions , for example , WASP / N - WASP , mammalian diaphanous ( mDia ) , and IRSp53 etc . A typical actin structure that Cdc42 drives is filopodia . Mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) with elevated expression of Cdc42 or a Cdc42 GAP with null mutations leads 9 to high Cdc42 activity and display many filopodia . In contrast , Cdc42 - null MEFs completely lack filopodia [ 58 ] . Cdc42 regulate filopodia formation through several downstream effectors : including by activating N - WASP which promotes actin branching at the base of filopodia , microspike formation in fibroblasts ; by regulating mDia which stimulates polymerization of unbranched actin filaments , and by regulating IRSp53 which is an Inverse - BAR ( I - BAR ) protein that induces outward membrane projection and bundles the actin filaments [ 59 ] . Cdc42 is also shown to drive membrane protrusions in lamellipodia by activating WASP or N - WASP at the cell periphery and promoting Arp2 / 3 mediated F - actin branching [ 52 ] . There is also evidence showing that Cdc42 is not essential for either filopodia or lamellipodia formation or directed cell migration using Cdc42 - deficient fibroblastoid cells [ 60 ] . In contrast to Ras GTPase , no acquired mutations in Cdc42 have been reported in human tumors to date . However , elevated Cdc42 expression has been described in highly invasive breast tumor cells [ 61 ] . Cdc42 can also regulate cell growth , since overexpression of constitutively active or fast cycling Cdc42 mutants ( e . g . F28L ) causes the malignant transformation of fibroblasts [ 62 , 63 ] . This result is well explained by a study showing that activated Cdc42 could sequester c - Cbl , an E3 - ubiquitin ligase , and prevent the downregulation of EGFR by ubiquitylation and degradation [ 64 ] . This study also demonstrates that Cdc42 signals both downstream and upstream of EGFR . 1 . 3 . 2 Rac GTPase signaling and cell motility Rac proteins are key regulators of cell migration and play essential roles in formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles [ 65 ] . Rac also promotes membrane extension during phagocytosis [ 65 ] . Rac can be activated by growth factors , cytokines , and extracellular matrix components that signal to PI3K , leading to recruitment and activation of GEFs , such as Dock180 10 [ 66 ] , Vav [ 67 ] , and Tiam - 1 [ 68 ] . For example , Tiam - 1 is a Rac GEF that is activated after its PH domain binds to PI3K products at the leading edge of motile cells [ 68 , 69 ] . Three isoforms of Rac have been identified and have different expression patterns . Rac1 is ubiquitously expressed , Rac2 is in haematopoietic cells , and Rac3 is found in the brain [ 70 ] . Rac1 is the best studied member . In a migrating cell , Rac1 preferentially localizes to the leading edge of the cell , where PI3K products such as PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 are enriched [ 71 ] . Cultured epiblast cells derived from early Rac1 - deficient embryos showed reduced migration rate [ 72 ] . Expression of dominant negative Rac1 inhibits lamellipodia , membrane ruffling , and migration in multiple cell types , including epithelial cells , fibroblasts , macrophages , and T cells [ 73 ] . Rac regulates actin polymerization in lamellipodia and membrane ruffles in several ways [ 59 ] . First , Rac activates WAVE proteins by directly interacting with a component of WAVE complex called specifically Rac - associated protein ( Sra , also called PIR121 ) or by binding to IRSp53 which has a SH3 that interacts with WAVE . Second , Rac binds to capping proteins and removes them from the barbed end to promote actin polymerization . Third , Rac regulates F - actin turn over by regulating F - actin - severing activity of cofilin . Rac mediated activation of PAK , which in turn activated LIM kinase that phosphorylates cofilin and reduces cofilin activity . Cdc42 also has this effect on cofilin through activation of PAK [ 74 ] . 1 . 3 . 3 WASP family actin nucleation - promoting factors WASP family proteins are important regulators of Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin assembly . They act as scaffold proteins that integrate and transfer upstream signals from Cdc42 and Rac , membrane phospholipids such as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , adaptor proteins , and protein kinases to Arp2 / 3 complex [ 46 , 75 ] . The WASP family is composed of 3 groups of proteins : WASP / N - WASP , SCAR / WAVEs ( 1 - 3 ) and WASH , WHAMM , and JMY [ 75 ] . N - WASP and WAVE are 11 well studied , WASH , WHAMM , and JMY are newly identified WASP / WAVE like proteins with unclear physiological roles [ 75 ] . 1 . 3 . 3 . 1 WASP / N - WASP WASP and N - WASP are related Cdc42 effector proteins that differ in expression pattern . WASP is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells , while N - WASP is expressed in neuronal cells and a variety of other cell types [ 75 ] . Mutations that either inhibit or deregulate WASP proteins cause Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome ( WAS ) , an X - linked immune disorder characterized by bleeding disorders and increased susceptibility to infections , autoimmune disease , and cancers [ 76 ] . WASP / N - WASP have an N - terminal WASP homology 1 ( WH1 ) domain , a basic region , a GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) ( also called Cdc42 / Rac - Interactive Binding ( CRIB ) ) , a proline - rich domain , and a C terminal verprolin / cofilin homology and acidic region ( VCA ) domain ( Fig . 1 . 2 ) . WH1 domain binds to the WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . WIP not only regulates WASP / N - WASP activity , but also its subcellular location [ 77 ] . Most point mutations leading to WAS are located in WH1 domain , which is the WIP binding domain [ 77 ] . Binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 recruits N - WASP to the plasma membrane . GBD domain interacts specifically with activated Cdc42 . The proline - rich ( PR ) domain provides docking sites for various SH3 domain – containing proteins that regulate WASP / N - WASP phosphorylation and activity , including , Src family tyrosine kinases , cortactin , WISH , Nck , Grb2 , Crk , FBP17 , CIP4 , Transducer of Cdc42 - mediated actin assembly - 1 ( Toca - 1 ) , Abelson - interactor - 1 ( Abi1 ) , endophilin A , and SNX - 9 [ 75 , 78 ] . The VCA domain binds Arp2 / 3 complex and soluble actin ( G - actin ) to promote actin assembly . In the resting cells , VCA domain is intramolecularly masked by its interaction of GBD domain . The binding of WIP ensures N - WASP remains in a tightly inhibited state [ 79 ] . Cdc42 binding can relieve N - WASP autoinhibition , allowing the VCA domain to bind Arp2 / 3 12 Figure 1 . 2 . WASP / N - WASP activation by Cdc42 and Toca - 1 . WASP / N - WASP has an N - terminal Wasp homology 1 ( WH1 ) domain mediating binding to WIP , a GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) conferring binding to Cdc42 , a proline - rich ( PR ) domain binding to multiple SH3 domain - containing proteins , and a VCA domain that binds Arp2 / 3 complex . Arp2 / 3 complex is composed of 7 actin - related proteins that are incorporated into new branched actin filaments . In the resting state , WASP / N - WASP is in an autoinhibited conformation , with the VCA domain is covered by GBD domain . The binding of WIP ensures its tight inhibition . Cdc42 is activated downstream of EGFR and GEFs ( eg . Vav2 ) . Binding of activated Cdc42 and Toca - 1 relieves WASP / N - WASP from its autoinhibited state , exposing the VCA domain to allow Arp2 / 3 binding and actin branching . Filopodia consist of bundled F - actin that arise from branched F - actin at the cell cortex . VCA WH1 GBD PR GTP Cdc42 Autoinhibited WASP / N - WASP Activated WASP / N - WASP VCA WH1 GBD P R WIP Toca - 1 Arp2 / 3 complex EGF EGFR 13 and promote actin polymerization in vitro [ 80 ] . In cells , N - WASP is complexed with WIP , and Cdc42 binding alone is unable to activate N - WASP . This led researchers in 2004 to report on a previously unknown protein that was required for this process of Cdc42 / N - WASP activation [ 81 ] . The protein was called Toca - 1 , and was shown to interact with both Cdc42 and N - WASP to promote actin assembly in Xenopus lysates ( Fig . 1 . 2 ) . Depletion of Toca - 1 from Xenopus lysates resulted in a loss of actin assembly via the Cdc42 / N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 pathway [ 81 ] . Toca - 1 will be discussed in more detail below as a member of the CIP4 subfamily of F - BAR proteins , and although it was the most recently cloned family member , its role in actin assembly led to rapid developments in the field of F - BAR adaptor proteins ( discussed in more detail below ) . N - WASP functions as a key effector of Cdc42 in filopodia formation . Co - expression of N - WASP and Cdc42 promotes the formation of long filopodia , and this requires the binding of Cdc42 to N - WASP [ 82 ] . More recently , co - expression of N - WASP and Toca - 1 was shown to promote filopodia formation in neuroblastoma cells [ 83 ] . N - WASP regulates EGFR internalization via CME . Formation of CCPs coincides with the recruitment of N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 and localized actin assembly that stabilizes membrane invaginations . Deficiency of N - WASP blocks accumulation of Arp2 / 3 and F - actin at CCPs , leading to reduced EGF internalization [ 84 , 85 ] . Cdc42 and N - WASP also localize to endosomes and regulate actin - based vesicle trafficking [ 86 , 87 ] ( Fig . 1 . 1 ) . Cdc42 and actin polymerization regulate endosomal trafficking and integrity that contributes to cell death signaling [ 86 ] . Src promotes Cdc42 activity and actin assembly at recycling endosomes , and cause disruption of recycling endosomes , which in turn causes loss of early endosome integrity [ 86 ] . 1 . 3 . 3 . 2 WAVE / SCAR 14 WAVE is a critical effector of Rac regulated membrane structures . Three WAVE proteins have been identified in mammals ( WAVE1 - 3 ) that are orthologues of Scar from Dictyostelium [ 46 ] . WAVE has an N - terminal WAVE homology domain ( WHD ) , a basic region , a proline - rich region , and a C - terminal VCA domain [ 46 , 88 ] ( Fig . 1 . 3 ) . Similar to N - WASP , VCA domain of WAVE binds to and activates Arp2 / 3 . Unlike N - WASP , it does not have a GBD domain that binds to Cdc42 or mediates auto - inhibition . The isolated WAVE protein is fully active . Rather , WAVE activity is inhibited in the WAVE complex , and can only be activated by binding of Rac . WAVE exists as a protein complex with Abi1 , HSPC 300 , Sra , and Nck associated protein ( Nap ) . Abi1 and Nap form the core of the complex , with binding of Abi1 to HSPC 300 on one side , and binding of Sra to Nap on the other side . The WHD domain of WAVE interacts with Abi1 and the actin - stimulating peptide , HSPC 300 . The VCA domain of WAVE is masked by the interaction with both Nap and Sra [ 79 , 88 ] ( Fig . 1 . 3 ) . Abi - 1 binding to WAVE2 is mediated by discrete motifs in the Abi - 1 coiled - coil and WAVE2 WHD domains . This interaction allows for Abi1 - induced translocation of WAVE2 to lamellipodia upon stimulation of cells with growth factors [ 89 ] . Abi1 also recruits WAVE2 to Abl protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) leading to WAVE2 phosphorylation , which increases WAVE2’s affinity for Arp2 / 3 [ 90 ] . However , for WAVE to induce actin assembly , Rac GTP must bind Sra in the WAVE complex . The binding of Rac to Sra releases the VCA domain of WAVE from Sra and Nap , and activates WAVE [ 79 ] . WAVE activity is also regulated by IRSp53 , an I - BAR and SH3 domain - containing protein [ 91 , 92 ] . It has been shown that IRSp53 recruits and activates WAVE2 at membrane protrusions induced by Rac [ 93 ] . The I - BAR domain of IRSp53 binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and induces outward membrane projections such as filopodia and lamellipodia , while the SH3 domain binds to WAVE2 and regulate WAVE2 localization and activity [ 94 , 95 ] . WAVE is activated by a 15 Figure 1 . 3 . WAVE complex and its activation by Rac . WAVE / Scar has an N - terminal WHD domain , a basic region , a proline - rich region , and a C - terminal VCA domain that binds and activates Arp2 / 3 . But it does not have a GBD domain that confers binding to Cdc42 . Isolated WAVE is fully active , but its activity is inhibited by a protein complex in cells . Abi1 and Nap form the core of the complex , Abi1 interacts with HSPC300 , Nap binds to Sra . Abi1 interacts with WAVE on WHD domain . The VCA domain of WAVE is masked by both Nap and Sra . Activated Rac binds to Sra , and relieves the VCA domain of WAVE from Sra and Nap . The exposed VCA domain binds Arp2 / 3 and promotes actin branching and lamellipodia formation downstream of Rac . WAVE activity is also regulated by binding to the SH3 domain of IRSp53 . IRSp53 has an I - BAR domain that promotes lamellipodia and filopodia formation . IRSp53 can be activated by Rac and recruit WAVE to plasma memranes . Rac , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 , and IRSp53 synergistically activate WAVE complex at the plasma membrane .

PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 generated by PI3K recruits WAVE2 by binding to WHD domain . Rac activates and recruits IRSp53 to the plasma membrane . Rac , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 , and IRSp53 have synergistic effects on WAVE2 activation on the plasma membrane [ 79 ] ( Fig 1 . 3 ) . WAVE is required for Rac - induced membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation [ 96 , 97 ] . Treating the cells with growth factors or expression of constitutively active Rac induces endogenous WAVE localization to membrane ruffles [ 98 ] . The biological consequence of WAVE signalling has been studied using WAVE knock - out mice . WAVE - 2 knockout is embryonic lethal , due to endothelial cell dysfunction , and defects in angiogenesis [ 97 , 99 ] . WAVE2 - deficient epithelial cells have impaired lamellipodia formation in the leading edge [ 99 ] . Also , cultured MEFs from WAVE2 - deficient mice exhibit defective Rac - mediated actin polymerization , lamellipodia formation , and cell motility in response to PDGF [ 97 ] , which suggests an important role of WAVE - 2 in growth factor - induced actin reorganization . Since WAVE - 1 expression is restricted to brain , where it regulates actin cytoskeleton that is important for neural function . WAVE - 1 knock - out mice showed defects in balance and coordination , reduced anxiety , and deficits in learning and memory [ 100 ] . Different from WASP , the role of WAVE in membrane deformation and trafficking remains to be defined . However , one recent study in Drosophila showed that both N - WASP and WAVE complex function in actin comet - based vesicle motility [ 101 ] . The cellular machinery that controls actin assembly is vital for normal cell physiology and tissue repair , but can also be exploited by cancer cells that wish to invade through tissue barriers . 17 1 . 4 Cell invasion and invadopodia The ability of cells to invade through the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is essential for many physiological processes , including wound healing , inflammatory responses , immune system function , embryogenesis , differentiation , and neoangiogenesis [ 102 ] . Podosomes are F - actin - based adhesion and ECM degrading structures formed in highly invasive immune cells such as monocytes and macrophages [ 103 ] . Although podosomes are required for tissue invasion by normal cells , cancer cells have co - opted this mechanism to their advantage by forming similar structures called invadopodia . Alterations to pathways controlling cell invasion within tumor cells has been linked to tumor metastasis [ 102 , 104 ] . Cancer cells make specialized , actin - based structures called invadopodia to digest ECM and cross tissue barriers . Invadopodia are finger - like , actin - rich protrusions that project from the ventral membrane and promote degradation of ECM by matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) . Invadopodia are composed of an F - actin core with actin regulatory proteins ( Arp2 / 3 , N - WASP , Cdc42 , cortactin , cofilin ) and a surrounding ring with protein kinases and other adaptor proteins ( e . g . PAK , PAK - interacting exchange factor ( PIX ) , Paxillin , Src , Protein kinase C ( PKC ) , ERK ) that regulate the actin machinery [ 105 , 106 ] ( Fig . 1 . 4 ) . 1 . 4 . 1 Actin core of invadopodia Cdc42 / N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 nucleates new branched actin within invadopodia ( Fig . 1 . 4 ) . Consistent with a prominent role for Cdc42 in breast cancer is the recent finding that Cdc42 GTPase expression is 11 - fold elevated in highly invasive breast cancer cells isolated from mice [ 61 ] . Transfecting the cells with constitutively active Cdc42 is shown to promote invadopodia formation in RPMI17951 melanoma cells [ 107 ] . RNA interference - mediated knock - down of Cdc42 or introducing constitutively inactive Cdc42 inhibited invadopodia formation in metastatic 18 Figure 1 . 4 . Structure of invadopodia . Invadopodia are composed of an F - actin core with actin regulatory proteins ( Arp2 / 3 , N - WASP , Cdc42 , cortactin , cofilin ) and a surrounding ring with protein kinases and other adaptor proteins . ( PAK , PIX , Paxillin , Src , PKC , ERK ) that regulate the actin machinery . N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 activate actin polymerization . Cortactin replaces N - WASP and stablizes the branched actin . Src phosphorylates cortactin leading to release of cofilin and increasing its actin severing activity . Cortactin also regulates MMP trafficking and secretion . Recently , it was shown that BAR protein endophilin A2 regulates ECM degradation by internalizing MT1 - MMP . Src phosphorylation of endophilin A2 leads to reduced affinity of endophilin A2 for dynamin , and thus reduced MT1 - MMP endocytosis . 19 MTLn3 rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells [ 108 ] . N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 are essential components of invadopodia . Knock - down of N - WASP , or transfecting a dominant negative N - WASP that lacks the VCA domain , led to defects in invadopodia formation and ECM degradation . Similarly , knock - down of Arp2 / 3 complex , or overexpression of N - WASP CA domain to sequester Arp2 / 3 complex , abrogated invadopodia formation [ 108 ] . Rac is also shown to promote invadopodia formation in melanoma cells [ 107 ] , presumably by activating WAVE and Arp2 / 3 complex . However , WAVE1 or WAVE2 - deficient cells form invadopodia normally [ 108 ] . Interestingly , WAVE1 - deficient cells showed significant lower ECM degradation [ 108 ] . These results suggest WAVE1 may regulate MMP secretion or exocytosis through vesicular trafficking but does not affect the actin core formation of invadopodia . Cortactin is an actin - binding protein that can be phosphorylated by Src , and is a marker of invadopodia [ 109 ] . It has an N - terminal acidic domain that binds to Arp2 / 3 and C - terminal SH3 domain that binds to N - WASP , WIP , and dynamin [ 109 ] . Cortactin is a less potent activator of Arp2 / 3 than N - WASP [ 109 , 110 ] , but can effectively stabilize branched actin by displacing N - WASP from the branchpoint [ 111 ] . Cortactin also regulates the F - actin severing protein cofilin that generates new barbed ends within invadopodia precursors [ 112 , 113 ] . Besides regulating actin machinery , cortactin also regulate the trafficking of MMP , including transmembrane type 1 - MMP ( MT1 - MMP ) , MMP2 , and MMP9 , to invadopodia ( Fig . 1 . 4 ) . Surprisingly its effect on ECM degradation is more prominent than its effects on invadopodia formation [ 114 ] . 1 . 4 . 2 Kinases regulating invadopodia Among the kinases ( Src , PAK , PKC , Erk etc . ) that regulate podosome and invadopodia , Src PTK is a key inducer . Src activity has been linked to breast tumor progression and metastasis [ 104 ] . Transfection of cells with active and inactive Src leads to increased and decreased 20 invadopodia formation and matrix degradation , respectively [ 115 , 116 ] . Src recruits regulators of invadopodia through its SH2 and SH3 domain and directly phosphorylates many key regulators of invadopodia ( Fig . 1 . 4 ) . Several proteins that are linked to Src signaling are shown to be required for invadopodia formation , including N - WASP [ 113 ] , Paxillin [ 117 ] , and Src substrates including cortactin [ 118 ] and Tks5 [ 119 ] . 1 . 4 . 3 Invadopodia - localized proteases A major distinction between invadopodia and other adhesive structures like focal adhesions is its ability to digest ECM . MMPs , especially MT1 - MMP , MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 , are enriched within invadopodia [ 120 ] . MT1 - MMP is particularly important in digesting ECM and is found to be positively associated with tumor progression and metastasis [ 120 , 121 ] . MT1 - MMP not only directly cleaves ECM components , including type - I , - II and - III collagen , gelatin , laminins 1 and 5 , fibronectin , vitronectin , aggrecan , and fibrin [ 122 ] , but also cleaves and activates secreted MMPs like MMP - 2 . MMP levels at the invadopodia are regulated by membrane trafficking and endocytosis ( Fig . 1 . 4 ) . Even cancer cells must limit the amount of ECM degradation by invadopodia , and this involves regulating signaling pathways impacting the actin assembly machinery and endocytosis . A recent study showed that internalization of MT1 - MMP is blocked by Src - induced phosphorylation of the BAR domain protein endophilin A2 , leading to reduced dynamin binding [ 123 ] ( Fig . 1 . 4 ) . With their potential involvement in both actin assembly and endocytosis , Pombe Cdc15 homology ( PCH ) / F - BAR proteins may also regulate invadopodia and tumor invasion or metastasis . 1 . 4 . 4 Stages of invadopodia formation Formation of invadopodia in MDA - MB - 231 cells has been divided to four different stages . In the initiation stage , cortactin and F - actin accumulate at ventral membranes adjacent to integrin - 21 mediated attachment to the ECM . Preinvadopodia stage is charaterized by accumulation of MT1 - MMP on top of intact matrix . Mature invadopodia are characterized by MT1 - MMP accumulation and matrix degradation . In the late invadopodia stage , cortactin and F - actin levels are reduced , but MT1 - MMP remains above areas of degraded ECM [ 124 ] . 1 . 5 PCH / F - BAR Proteins Mammalian PCH proteins evolved from Cdc15p in fission yeast , and comprise a family of multi - domain adaptor proteins that regulate many fundamental cellular processes including endocytosis , exocytosis , membrane trafficking , cell division , cell migration , and cell invasion [ 125 - 128 ] . PCH / F - BAR proteins are grouped into six subfamilies based on their domain organization and sequence homology : Fes / Fer tyrosine kinase subfamily , PACSIN / syndapin subfamily , CIP4 subfamily , srGAP subfamily , PSTPIP , and FCH domain - only ( FCHO ) subfamily [ 128 ] ( Fig . 1 . 5 ) . All PCH family proteins have an N - terminal F - BAR domain . Their C - termini have various combinations of SH2 , SH3 , kinase , and RhoGAP domains [ 128 ] . Cdc15p is the ancestral family member . Cdc15p promotes the formation of the contractile actomyosin ring during cell division by recruiting formin Cdc12p and the Arp2 / 3 activator Myo1p [ 129 , 130 ] . So PCH family proteins were initially described as a family that regulates cytokinesis and actin dynamics [ 126 ] . The discovery of F - BAR domains in recent years has provided novel insights into the function of these proteins . Before the discovery of the larger F - BAR domain and its role in phospholipid binding , the FCH motif was identified as a region of shared homology between CIP4 and other members of the PCH family [ 131 ] . Later , the FCH motif in CIP4 was found to 22 Figure 1 . 5 . Dendogram of Human PCH proteins identifies six subfamilies . The PCH / F - BAR proteins can be classified into six subfamilies based on sequence comparison using Clustal W : the CIP4 subfamily ( focus of this thesis ) , Fes / Fer tyrosine kinase subfamily , the PACSIN / syndapin subfamily , the srGAP subfamily , and the PSTPIP , and FCHO subfamily . Adapted from Ref . [ 128 ] . 23 confer binding to microtubules in vitro and for CIP4 to recruit WASP to microtubules in transfected cells [ 132 ] . A major breakthrough in this field came with the functional characterization of the F - BAR ( also called Extended FCH ( EFC ) ) domain by the de Camilli [ 133 ] and Takenawa groups [ 134 ] . These studies found that all PCH proteins share F - BAR domains comprising FCH motifs and coil - coiled motifs that are evolutionarily and functionally similar to BAR domains . Like BAR domains , F - BAR domains were shown to bind phosphoinositides in liposomes and cause them to acquire an extended tubule shape . Functional studies were included in both papers showing that overexpression or knock - down ( KD ) of F - BAR adaptor proteins could impair endocytosis of transferrin or labeled EGF . The previous study of a prominent membrane tubulation phenotype caused by overexpression of the F - BAR adaptor FBP17 [ 135 ] , provided several key observations that were furthered by the Itoh et al . [ 133 ] and Tsujita et al . [ 134 ] studies . Namely , that one could perturb membrane structure by altering levels of FBP17 or its N - terminal domain , and that these tubules contained the endocytic regulator dynamin [ 135 ] . Another major advance came with the report of the crystal structures of F - BAR domains from FBP17 and CIP4 [ 136 ] , and also for FCHO2 [ 137 ] . The F - BAR domain structure included approximately amino acids 1 - 300 of these F - BAR proteins . It is composed of two monomers that form an antiparallel dimer with a crescent or banana shape related to that of the BAR domain [ 136 , 137 ] . The curvature surface of the dimer is covered by clusters of conserved , cationic residues which bind to the negatively charged head group of phosphoinositides in the lipid membrane [ 136 , 137 ] . The studies confirmed that F - BAR domains resemble BAR domains in both structure and function . BAR domain dimers are membrane - binding and curvature sensing modules found in many proteins involved in endocytosis and trafficking [ 138 , 139 ] . BAR domains are also antiparallel dimers with a crescent or banana shape . Examples of BAR proteins 24 include adaptors ( eg . endophilin [ 140 , 141 ] , amphiphysin , sorting nexins [ 142 ] ) , and some Rac / Cdc42 regulators ( eg . Tuba [ 143 ] , RICH - 1 [ 144 ] ) . Like BAR domains , F - BAR domains bind to phospholipid membranes and induce membrane tubulation both in vitro and in vivo . Compared to the BAR dimer , the F - BAR dimer is longer and the curvature is shallower . The long axis of the F - BAR dimer is 195A° with an arc depth of 9A° , compared to a depth of 30A° for BAR domains [ 137 ] ( Fig . 1 . 6 ) . Accordingly , F - BAR domains ( of FBP17 ) prefer liposomes with large diameters of approximately 500nm , and generate wide membrane tubules of ≈ 200 nm in diameter , while BAR domains ( of amphiphysin ) prefer smaller diameter liposomes and generate narrow tubules with diameters of ≈ 50 nm [ 134 , 136 ] . Structural analysis of F - BAR domains shows that the tubules generated by F - BAR domain correlates with the size of CCPs [ 136 , 145 ] . A further study using cryoelectron microscopy was able to fit the F - BAR dimer into a repeating filament pattern that was observed surrounding the membrane tubule [ 145 ] . This study identified important lateral contact sites that allow F - BAR dimers to align along a curved membrane , and these interactions were essential for membrane tubulation in vitro and in vivo ( Fig . 1 . 7 ) . 1 . 6 CIP4 subfamily proteins The CIP4 subfamily of PCH / F - BAR proteins includes CIP4 , Toca - 1 , and FBP17 that share approximately 55 % sequence identity [ 81 , 146 ] , and have received considerable attention in recent years . My thesis will focus mostly on two members of the CIP4 subfamily ( CIP4 and Toca - 1 ) that are unique in their abilities in binding directly to Cdc42 . 25 Figure 1 . 6 . Comparison of F - BAR and BAR domain dimers . Structures of FCHO2 F - BAR [ 137 ] , CIP4 F - BAR , FBP17 F - BAR [ 136 ] , and endophlin BAR domain are shown above . F - BAR and BAR domain is an antiparallel dimer that is formed by two subunits ( one in green , one in red ) . Each subunit has 5 α helices . Both F - BAR domain and BAR domain adopt a crescent or banana shape . BAR domain has a deeper curvature of 30 Å , while the F - BAR domain has a shallower curvature of 9 Å [ 137 ] . This figure is adapted from [ 125 ] . 26 Figure 1 . 7 . Lipid binding residues within F - BAR dimers bound to curved membranes tubules . There are four resolved membrane binding points along the concave face of the dimer . Two clusters of basic residues are found in the center of the concave face ( R / K27 , K30 , K33 , K110 , R113 , K114 , R / K denotes either Arg or Lys are found in F - BARs from CIP4 and FBP17 , respectively ) . Two other clusters near the tips of the dimer are also found ( R139 , R / K140 , R / K146 and R / K150 ; R / K denotes either Arg or Lys are found in F - BARs from CIP4 and FBP17 , respectively ) . Adapted from Ref . [ 145 ] . 27 1 . 6 . 1 Domain organization of CIP4 family proteins Besides the F - BAR domain shared between all PCH / F - BAR proteins , CIP4 family proteins also have a C - terminal SH3 domain and a central protein kinase C - related kinase homology region - 1 ( HR1 ) domain ( Fig 1 . 8 ) . SH3 domains confer binding to proline - rich domains in proteins such as N - WASP and dynamin , that play important roles in regulating actin dynamics and membrane scission [ 133 , 134 ] . N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 complex mediate the formation of branched networks of actin filaments [ 80 ] . Dynamin is a large GTPase that plays a critical role in endocytosis by pinching off the invaginated membrane [ 25 ] . The HR1 domain has homology to the RhoA - interacting domain from PKN , PRK1 , rhophilin , and other Rho - binding proteins [ 147 ] , it is a domain that is unique in CIP4 family proteins among PCH / F - BAR proteins . The HR1 domain binds to small GTPase , and in case of CIP4 and Toca - 1 , it confers binding to Cdc42 GTP [ 81 , 131 ] . The HR1 domain of FBP17 does not bind to Cdc42 but to Rnd2 GTPase [ 148 ] ( Fig . 1 . 8 ) . The structure of the HR1 domain of CIP4 [ 149 ] and PRK1 [ 150 ] was recently solved by NMR , and provides insight into how this finger - like domain interacts with Cdc42 GTP . 1 . 6 . 2 The common functions of CIP4 family proteins CIP4 family proteins have been shown to regulate multiple fundamental cellular functions . With F - BAR domains binding to phosphoinositides in the membrane , and SH3 domains binding to N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 complex , CIP4 family proteins couple membrane invagination with actin branching . F - BAR domain of CIP4 and FBP17 are found to bind with high affinity to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and causes invagination of the plasma membrane during endocytosis [ 133 , 134 ] ( Fig . 1 . 9 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 is a phosphoinositide implicated in localizing regulators of CME to microdomains within the plasma membrane [ 151 ] . CIP4 and FBP17 F - BAR domains induce liposome tubulation in vitro and plasma membrane tubulation in vivo [ 133 , 134 , 145 ] . The ability of 28 Figure 1 . 8 . Domain organization and reported binding partners for CIP4 family proteins . CIP4 family consists of CIP4 , Toca - 1 , and FBP17 that share similar domain organization . F - BAR domains bind to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and promote membrane invaginations . HR1 domains bind to Cdc42 GTP ( CIP4 and Toca - 1 ) , or Rnd2 GTP ( FBP17 ) . HR1 domain of CIP4 is also shown to bind to TC10 ( a Cdc42 family member ) in adipocytes . The linker region between HR1 and SH3 domain of CIP4 contains a putative PxxP motif that binds the SH3 domain of Src and a phosphorylation site ( Y471 ) . C - terminal SH3 domains of CIP4 family proteins interact with many proteins , including N - WASP and dynamin . CIP4 has several distinct SH3 binding partners , including RICH - 1 ( a GAP for Cdc42 and Rac ) , and Gapex - 5 ( a GEF for Rab31 ) . Similar domain organization , and partially overlap and distinct binding partners suggest they have potential redundant and unique functions .

This suggests that CIP4 or FBP17 - induced actin assembly promotes the scission of invaginated membranes into vesicles . Dynamin recruitment to SH3 domains of either BAR or F - BAR adaptors also promotes scission of invaginated membranes , since dominant - negative dynamin mutants promote membrane tubulation induced by FBP17 [ 133 ] . Expression of FBP17 without it’s SH3 domain results in long membrane tubules remaining associated with plasma membrane [ 133 ] . Thus , CIP4 family proteins are thought to coordinate actin assembly and membrane deformation during endocytosis ( Fig . 1 . 9 ) . 1 . 6 . 2 . 1 CIP4 subfamily regulates endocytosis CIP4 family proteins have been implicated in regulating CME ( Fig . 1 . 9 ) . Defects in uptake of transferrin via CME were observed upon overexpression of FBP17 or CIP4 . Similar defects were observed via siRNA - mediated KD of FBP17 or triple KD all three CIP4 subfamily members [ 133 ] . Similar results were observed for labeled EGF internalization following KD of CIP4 and / or FBP17 [ 134 ] . EGF uptake occurs via multiple pathways including CME , and macropinocytosis , while tranferrin uptake is exclusively via CME . In Drosophila , only one CIP4 family member exists ( dCIP4 ) , which functions in E - cadherin internalization via a Cdc42 / WASP pathway [ 152 ] . Another study showed that dCIP4 regulates endocytosis , actin - based vesicle transport in polarized epithelial cells that controls wing hair development [ 101 ] . Endocytosis defects were also observed in C . elegans lacking the CIP4 / TOCA subfamily adaptors [ 153 ] . More recently , CIP4 knock - out mice were reported to be viable , but to have defects in insulin metabolism due to roles of CIP4 in Glucose - transporter 4 ( Glut4 ) endocytosis , MEFs isolated from CIP4 - null mice also display defects in multiple types of endocytosis of multiple ligands , 30 Figure 1 . 9 . Model of F - BAR proteins in regulating endocytosis . Clathrin coated pits are formed with the recruitment of clathrin and AP2 in the membrane that is enriched with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . F - BAR proteins recognize the curvature and further promote membrane invaginations . The membrane curvature also triggers F - BAR proteins to induce actin polymerization that constricts the neck . The narrow tubules on the neck recruit BAR proteins . BAR proteins , dynamin , and F - actin induce the scission of the vesicles . Adapted from Ref . [ 154 ] . 31 including transferrin , dextran , and horseradish peroxidase [ 155 ] . 1 . 6 . 2 . 2 CIP4 subfamily proteins regulate actin organization As CIP4 was first identified by interaction with activated Cdc42 [ 131 ] , much attention was focused on the role of CIP4 in actin cytoskeleton reorganization prior to the discovery of F - BAR domains . Overexpression of CIP4 led to reduced stress fiber formation in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts [ 131 ] . Moreover , expression of an activated mutant of Cdc42 with CIP4 resulted in accumulation of CIP4 to a large number of foci at the dorsal side of the cells [ 131 ] . Later on , Toca - 1 was identified as an essential component of N - WASP activation by Cdc42 [ 81 ] . These studies suggest CIP4 family proteins regulate actin polymerization through the Cdc42 / N - WASP pathway . However , Cdc42 is not essential in activating WASP / N - WASP . FBP17 , which does not bind to Cdc42 , can also activate N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro [ 134 ] and co - localizes with N - WASP at plasma membrane in COS - 7 cells [ 134 ] . Other PCH / F - BAR proteins that do not have a HR1 domain can also regulate WASP / N - WASP mediated actin polymerization , such as PACSINs and PSTPIP1 [ 125 ] . However , expression of Cdc42 can further enhance N - WASP activation by CIP4 and Toca - 1 [ 156 ] . CIP4 family proteins can also bind mammalian Diaphanous - related formins ( DRFs ) ( eg . mDia ) , that induce polymerization of bundled actin filaments in filopodia and invadopodia downstream of Cdc42 . SH3 domains of CIP4 , Toca - 1 , and FBP17 could all bind Disheveled - associated Activator of Morphogenesis ( DAAM1 ) , mDia1 , and mDia2 [ 157 ] . Expression of DAAM1 induced formation of branched protrusions , while co - expression of CIP4 with DAAM1 induced shorter protrusions [ 157 ] . 1 . 6 . 3 CIP4 and Toca - 1 isoforms The similar domain organization and partly overlapping expression pattern of CIP4 and Toca - 1 suggests that they may have both redundant and unique functions . Toca - 1 is a CIP4 - 32 related adaptor protein which encodes a 547 amino acid protein with 55 % sequence identity to CIP4 [ 146 ] . Compared to ubiquitously expressed CIP4 , Toca - 1 is expressed only in brain [ 81 ] , testis , macrophages , and some carcinomas [ 146 ] . Both CIP4 and Toca - 1 undergo alternative splicing , giving rise to several isoforms ( Table 1 . 1 ) . The presence of these isoforms in different tissues suggests that they have tissue specific functions ( Table 1 . 1 ) . 1 . 6 . 3 . 1 Unique functions of CIP4 CIP4 has several binding partners that have not been described for other CIP4 family members , including TC10 GTPase that binds the HR1 domain . Also , the SH3 domain of CIP4 binds RhoGAP - interacting with CIP4 homologues ( RICH - 1 ) that inactivates Cdc42 or Rac [ 57 ] , and a Rab31 GEF called Gapex - 5 [ 158 , 159 ] . 1 . 6 . 3 . 1 . 1 CIP4 regulates insulin pathway Insulin stimulates glucose uptake by promoting the translocation of Glut4 from storage vesicles within the cytosol to the plasma membrane . TC10 is activated downstream of insulin receptor and plays an important role in insulin - stimulated glucose transport . Using TC10 as a bait , CIP4 / 2 ( the alternatively spliced CIP4 containing an extra exon encoding 56 aa ) was identified as a binding partner . Insulin stimulation or overexpression of TC10 translocates CIP4 / 2 to plasma membrane . This translocation is important for insulin - stimulated Glut4 transport to plasma membrane [ 160 ] . Later , using CIP4 / 2 as the bait protein , a Rab31 GEF named Gapex - 5 / RME - 6 was identified [ 159 ] . Rab31 is a Rab5 subfamily GTPase involved in trafficking from trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) to endosomes . Gapex - 5 activates Rab31 and blocks the translocation of Glut4 vesicles to plasma membrane by promoting the fusion of Glut4 vesicles with early endosomes . Insulin stimulation recruits CIP4 / Gapex - 5 complex to plasma membrane , 33 Isoforms Structure Expression pattern Proposed Function CIP4 CIP4a ( CIP4 ) major isoform Ubiqutously expressed Endocytosis , glucose metabolism , immunity CIP4b Ref .

With the findings of the role of F - BAR domain in endocytosis , the role of CIP4a in Glut4 endocytosis was studied . Consistent with the role of CIP4 family proteins in transferrin and EGF endocytosis , CIP4 also promotes Glut4 endocytosis in Rat Glut4myc - expressing L6 myoblast , in which CIP4 is the predominantly - expressed F - BAR protein . The insulin - inducible interaction of CIP4 with N - WASP and dynamin is important for Glut endocytosis [ 164 ] . To study the physiological role of CIP4 , they also created CIP4 - null mice . Cip4 - null mice displayed decreased early post - prandial glucose level compared to wild - type mice . Consistently , adipocytes isolated from CIP4 null mice intake higher glucose , possibly due to high level Glut4 which was detected in muscle membrane fractionation [ 155 ] . 1 . 6 . 3 . 1 . 2 CIP4 and cancer A splicing variant of CIP4 , CIP4V , which lacks a tyrosine phosphorylation site , HR1 domain , and SH3 domain , was identified in human renal carcinoma cells . Cell adhesion plays an important role in cancer cell migration and invasion . They found CIPV regulates cell - cell adhesion possibly by regulating β - catenin mistrafficking from plasma membrane to cytoplasmic aggresome [ 165 ] . CIP4 is also involved in breast cancer cell apoptosis . CIP4 is upregulated in MDA - MB - 231 cells following treatment with a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor , Adriamycin ( ADR ) . Pretreating the cells with hepatocyte growth factor / scatter factor protects cells from apoptosis induced by ADR , and interestingly , this pretreatment also blocks CIP4 upregulation induced by ADR . This study suggest that CIP4 is involved in cell survival and apoptosis [ 166 ] . 1 . 6 . 3 . 1 . 3 CIP4 regulates the immune response 35 CIP4 also play important roles in the function of macrophages . Before the finding of F - BAR domain , the N - terminus of CIP4 was regarded as an FCH domain that binds microtubules ( MTs ) and was required for WASP recruitment to MTs in macrophages [ 132 ] . Microinjection of macrophages with CIP4 mutants lacking their MT or WASP binding domains blocked podosome formation [ 167 ] . CIP4 is also essential for directed secretion by natural killer ( NK ) cells . Polarization of microtubule organizing center ( MTOC ) and secretary machineries is prerequisite for directed secretion . CIP4 was found to accumulate at MTOC and to be required for MTOC polarization and cytotoxic activity . CIP4 may function as a link between MT and F - actin and thus promotes the secretion and cytotoxicity of NK cells [ 168 ] . CIP4 may also regulate macrophage phagocytosis . Both CIP4a and CIP4b can be recruited to phagocytic cups in macrophages , however , CIP4b which lacks the SH3 domain was recruited more efficiently . CIP4b may have evolved to uncouple membrane membrane invagination from scission , which could play a role in promoting membrane protrusions like phagocytic cups and filopodia [ 127 ] . Recently , FBP17 is found to localize to podosome and phagocytic cups and regulate their formation in macrophages [ 169 ] . 1 . 6 . 3 . 1 . 4 Other functions of CIP4 CIP4 is involved in the progression of Huntington’s disease . Huntington’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by selective neuron loss , especially in striatum and cerebral cortex . It is caused by polyglutamine ( polyQ ) expansion in huntingtin protein . Huntingtin interacts with CIP4 , and CIP4 is significantly upregulated in the brain striatum from human samples with Huntington’s disease . Importantly , CIP4 expression level correlated with the severity of the disease [ 170 ] . 36 CIP4 is essential in maintaining Golgi structure . A Golgi protein , Cyclic AMP - dependent protein kinase ( AKAP ) 350 that participates in PKA signaling , is shown to bind both CIP4 and FBP17 . However , CIP4 and FBP17 showed a different subcellular localization pattern in Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells . FBP17 localizes to plasma membrane , while CIP4 localizes to perinuclear area , suggesting their unique functions in MDCK cells . Only CIP4 colocalizes with AKAP350 and gets phosphorylated by PKA at the Golgi . Disruption of CIP4 - AKAP350 interaction by expressing CIP4 binding domain of AKAP350 results in a morphological changes in Golgi stacking and trans - Golgi dispersion [ 171 ] . 1 . 6 . 3 . 2 Roles of Toca - 1 Toca - 1 was first described in 2004 , when it was identified as an essential component of Cdc42 / N - WASP - dependent actin assembly in Xenopus extracts [ 81 ] . This report challenges the previous autoinhibitory model of WASP / N - WASP , and opens up a new avenue for study of WASP / N - WASP regulation of actin assembly . Most of Toca - 1’s function is linked to its SH3 domain in activating N - WASP and its F - BAR domain mediated membrane invagination . In 2008 , a paper showed Toca - 1 and FBP17 mediated actin polymerization through N - WASP is sensitive to membrane curvature [ 156 ] . This study suggested that Toca - 1 induced tubulation before the actin polymerization , and membrane curvature itself can also be an intracellular signal to regulate actin assembly . 1 . 6 . 3 . 2 . 1 Role of Toca - 1 in neurite formation Toca - 1 is highly expressed in neurons , along with N - WASP . Interestingly , KD of N - WASP promotes neurite elongation in PC12 cells . Likewise , KD of Toca - 1 promotes neurite elongation , and overexpression of Toca - 1 inhibits neurite elongation . Surprisingly , Toca - 1’s 37 effect on neurite elongation does not require Cdc42 or N - WASP binding sites , but requires the F - BAR domain [ 163 ] . Thus , Toca - 1 and N - WASP may inhibit neurite elongation via effects on endocytosis . Later on , another study showed an opposite observation that Toca - 1 induces filopodia and neurite formation in N1E115 neuroblastoma cells [ 83 ] . Further , these effects of Toca - 1 required all three domains , F - BAR , GBD , and SH3 domains . 1 . 6 . 3 . 2 . 2 Other functions of Toca - 1 One study showed that Toca - 1 is required for Shigella flexneri - induced actin tail formation in mammalian cells . Shigella can recruit both N - WASP and Toca - 1 to its surface , where Toca - 1 activates N - WASP and initiates localized actin tail formation , which propel the bacteria across the cytosol of infected epithelial cells [ 172 ] . Toca - 1 is also involved in autophagy of an intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium . Both the membrane binding F - BAR domain and ATG3 protein binding to the HR1 domain are required for this function of Toca - 1 [ 173 ] . In C . elegans , Toca - 1 / Toca - 2 regulate endocytosis , egg production , and epithelial cell - cell junctions important for epithelial morphogenesis [ 153 ] . 1 . 7 Hypotheses By virtue of their F - BAR domains and ability to trigger actin assembly , the CIP4 family proteins are thought to trigger early events in endocytosis of receptors such as EGFR . However , membrane dynamics and actin polymerization also play important roles in intracellular membrane trafficking . Besides , many BAR proteins have been shown to regulate membrane trafficking . Furthermore , my early findings identified these proteins localized mostly in the cytosol in punctate structures that resembled vesicles . This led me to hypothesize that CIP4 and Toca - 1 function in later steps in endocytic trafficking . This could relate to CIP4 or Toca - 1 promoting 38 tubulation of endosomal membranes for sorting of cargo , such as that mediated by BAR domain - containing sorting nexins that regulate membrane trafficking from endosomes to TGN [ 174 ] . During the course of my studies , several reports emerged that linked CIP4 to vesicle trafficking in NK cells [ 168 ] and adipocytes [ 159 ] . Considering the emerging role of endocytic trafficking in propagating and regulating EGFR signaling and the importance of EGFR signaling in regulation of cancer progression , I investigated the potential roles of CIP4 and Toca - 1 in endosomal trafficking and downregulation of EGFR . EGFR signaling regulates the actin cytoskeleton to promote migration and invasion of epithelia - derived cancers . Since Toca - 1 promotes actin assembly by Cdc42 / N - WASP in vitro [ 156 ] and actin assembly induced by pathogenic bacteria in vivo [ 172 ] , I hypothesized that Toca - 1 would function in actin - based motility of cells . Given that the Cdc42 / N - WASP complex is important for filopodia and lamellipodia formation ; there may be defects in actin assembly driving both types of membrane protrusion . During the course of our work , I was aware of emerging findings that link Toca - 1 to Abi1 and the Rac / WAVE pathway . Since Rac / WAVE / Abi1 function in lamellipodia formation and cell motility , this suggested to me that Toca - 1 could be coordinating the localization of the Cdc42 / N - WASP and Rac / WAVE / Abi1 actin assembly pathways . This work is now published , showing that dCIP4 , which is the only CIP4 family member in Drosophila , binds to both N - WASP and Abi1 / WAVE , and promotes vesicle trafficking propelled by actin comets and wing hair formation [ 101 ] . Also , human Toca - 1 was shown to interact with WAVE via Abi1 in mammalian cells [ 153 ] . This led me to pursue the hypothesis that Toca - 1 functions in Rac signaling and lamellipodia formation via promoting actin branching below the membrane protrusions . Furthermore , I hypothesized that cells depleted of Toca - 1 would exhibit defects in cell migration . 39 Tumor invasion of the ECM during metastasis is linked to formation of invadopodia . CIP4 interacts with several key components of invadopodia ( eg . Cdc42 , N - WASP , dynamin , Src ) , and regulates cellular processes important for invadopodia formation ( eg . vesicle trafficking , endocytosis ) . However , the role of CIP4 in regulating invadopodia formation is largely unknown . Prior to our study , only one paper reported that CIP4 might regulate macrophage podosome formation , which are invadopodia - related structures formed in normal cells [ 175 ] . More recently , FBP17 has been linked to podosome formation in THP - 1 monocytes [ 169 ] . Thus , it would be important and promising to identify the role of CIP4 in invadopodia formation and invasiveness . Interestingly , several key components of invadopodia ( eg . N - WASP , dynamin , Tks5 ) have phospholipid binding domains , which may be critical for localization of these proteins in invadopodia . For example , Tks5 , a BAR domain - containing protein normally localized to endosomes , is recruited to Src - induced podosomes through binding to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 [ 176 ] . I hypothesized that CIP4 would localize to Src - induced invadopodia via either lipid interactions ( F - BAR mediated ) or protein - protein interactions ( eg . Cdc42 , N - WASP , Dynamin , Src ) , Once recruited , CIP4 may regulate actin assembly , endocytosis or exocytosis to regulate Src / Cdc42 - driven invadopodia formation and invasion of breast cancer cells . 1 . 8 Objectives : To test these hypotheses , I will : 1 . Study the role of CIP4 and Toca - 1 in endosomal trafficking and downstream signaling of EGFR in carcinoma cells . 2 . Study the role of Toca - 1 in regulating lamellipodia formation and cell migration 3 . Define the role of CIP4 in invadopodia formation and cell invasion . 40 Chapter 2 F - BAR - Containing Adaptor CIP4 Localizes to Early Endosomes and Regulates Trafficking and Downregulation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 . 1 Abstract Cdc42 - Interacting Protein - 4 ( CIP4 ) and related adaptor proteins forming - binding protein 17 ( FBP17 ) , Transducer of Cdc42 - mediated actin assembly - 1 ( Toca - 1 ) are regulators of membrane and actin assembly dynamics via the coordinate functions of their F - BAR and SH3 domains . While previous studies implicate CIP4 family adaptors in promoting early events in internalization of receptors , including Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) , the unique and overlapping functions of the CIP4 family adaptors remains unclear . Here , we show that while FBP17 is the key player in early events of clathrin - mediated endocytosis of EGFR at the plasma membrane , CIP4 and Toca - 1 localize to vesicles containing EGFR and Rab5 , including giant endosomes induced by constitutively active Rab5 . This localization is in part mediated by the curved phosphoinositide - binding face of the CIP4 F - BAR domain . Overexpression of CIP4 , but not the F - BAR mutant , results in downregulation of EGFR in HeLa cells . In contrast , EGFR levels increased upon silencing of CIP4 and Toca - 1 by RNAi in A431 cells . While surface expression of EGFR was not altered by silencing of CIP4 and Toca - 1 , increased EGFR localization to early endosomes and less targeting to lysosomes was detected . This correlated with more robust activation of ERK kinase and entry to S - phase by silencing of CIP4 and Toca - 1 in A431 cells , compared to control cells . Overall , our results implicate CIP4 and Toca - 1 in regulating late events in EGFR trafficking from early endosomes that serve to limit sustained ERK activation within the endosomal compartment . 41 2 . 2 Introduction Epidermal Growth Factor ( EGF ) and EGFR play important roles during embryonic development and in epithelial wound healing responses [ 5 ] . Elevated expression of EGFR or its co - receptor erythroblastosis oncogene B 2 ( ErbB2 ) / Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 ( Her2 ) receptor are frequently observed in cancer [ 4 ] . An important mode of regulation of EGFR signaling involves the rapid internalization of activated EGFR via either clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , or non - clathrin mediated endocytosis ( NCE ) pathways [ 17 ] . Recent studies have implicated CME in EGFR signaling , while NCE leads to ubuiquitylation and degradation of EGFR [ 19 ] . Internalization of EGFR allows for compartmentalized signaling from early endosomes [ 177 ] . Several key pathways , including the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) / Akt and Ras / extracellular signal - regulated kinases ( ERK ) pathways , are activated in a more sustained manner by early endosome - localized EGFR relative to EGFR signaling from the plasma membrane [ 178 ] . This sustained signaling is required for cell survival and proliferation signaling , and is mediated in part via differential localization of scaffolding proteins to phosphatidylinositol - 3’ phosphate ( PI ( 3 ) P ) - containing endosomal membranes [ 33 ] . Rab5 GTPase plays a critical role in promoting PI ( 3 ) P formation , vesicle trafficking and fusion with early endosomes [ 179 , 180 ] . Aberrant Rab5 activation leads to alterations in endocytic compartments , EGFR downregulation , and ERK Mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) activation [ 37 , 181 , 182 ] . CIP4 is a member of the Pombe Cdc15 Homology ( PCH ) / Fer - CIP4 Homology ( FCH ) - Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( F - BAR ) family of proteins defined by their F - BAR domain [ 126 - 128 ] . In addition to the F - BAR domain , the CIP4 subfamily of PCH / F - BAR proteins possess an Homology Region - 1 ( HR1 ) domain conferring interaction with small GTPases [ 147 ] , and a C - 42 terminal SH3 domain that binds numerous ligands , including N - WASP ( Reviewed in Ref . [ 127 ] ) . While both CIP4 and Toca - 1 were cloned on the basis of their interaction with activated Cdc42 [ 81 , 131 ] , an important insight into their potential function came from the identification of Toca - 1 as an essential factor for Cdc42 GTP to activate N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 - driven actin assembly in Xenopus extracts [ 81 ] . This activity of Toca - 1 required both HR1 - mediated binding of Cdc42 and SH3 - mediated binding of N - WASP [ 81 ] . Since this discovery , similar activity has been described for another family member called forming - binding protein 17 ( FBP17 ) [ 156 ] , despite the fact that the HR1 domain of FBP17 does not interact with Cdc42 [ 135 , 183 ] . F - BAR domains function as phosphoinositide - binding modules that induce or stabilize membrane curvature at the plasma membrane to promote receptor internalization [ 133 - 135 , 145 ] . F - BAR domains adopt a curved helical bundle dimer conformation , with a highly basic concave surface implicated in phospholipid binding and promoting membrane curvature [ 136 , 137 , 145 ] . Several F - BAR domains display high affinity for phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ; ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) – containing liposomes [ 133 , 134 , 184 ] , a phosphoinositide implicated in localizing regulators of clathrin - mediated endocytosis to microdomains in the plasma membrane [ 185 , 186 ] . The HR1 domain has homology to the RhoA - interacting domain from PKN [ 147 ] , and in case of CIP4 and Toca - 1 it confers binding to Cdc42 GTP ( or TC10 in adipocytes ) [ 81 , 131 , 160 ] . The C - terminal SH3 domains of CIP4 and Toca - 1 bind a number of proteins implicated in regulation of actin assembly and endocytosis , including : N - WASP / WASP [ 132 - 134 ] , and dynamin [ 133 , 134 ] . In the case of the CIP4 SH3 domain , interactions have also been identified with RhoGAP - interacting with CIP4 homologues ( RICH - 1 ) [ 57 ] , and a Rab5 GEF called Gapex - 5 [ 159 ] . N - WASP and dynamin play key roles in CME by promoting actin assembly that drives constriction of the neck area of membrane invaginations , followed by pinching off the membrane to form clathrin - coated vesicles 43 [ 84 , 85 , 187 , 188 ] . Depletion of CIP4 family adaptors via RNAi resulted in defects in uptake of EGF and transferrin [ 133 , 134 ] , suggesting a positive role in CME and possibly in NCE mechanisms . Of the CIP4 family , FBP17 is likely a key player in early events of CME based on its localization to clathrin coated pits ( CCPs ) [ 136 ] , and the observed defects in EGF uptake when FBP17 was depleted individually [ 134 ] . The proposed model for F - BAR - containing adaptor proteins to promote endocytosis involves : a ) F - BAR domain - induced formation and stabilization of membrane invaginations , b ) SH3 domain - mediated recruitment and activation of N - WASP to promote localized actin assembly , and c ) SH3 domain - mediated recruitment of dynamin to promote vesicle scission [ 126 , 127 , 189 ] . Recent work in Drosophila , which harbors a single CIP4 family member ( dCIP4 ) , implicates dCIP4 in functioning with Cdc42 / WASP to regulate trafficking of E - Cadherin in epithelial tissues [ 152 ] . These results are consistent with several recent studies implicating Cdc42 and the Par3 / Par6 / aPKC polarity proteins in regulating endocytic trafficking to maintain stable cell - cell junctions in polarized epithelial cells [ 190 , 191 ] . In mammalian cells , there is mounting evidence for unique functions of individual CIP4 family adaptors . Toca - 1 depletion by RNAi resulted in failure of Shigella flexneri - induced actin comet formation [ 172 ] . Another recent study implicates Toca - 1 in limiting Salmonella enteric growth by promoting autophagy [ 173 ] . It is worth noting that in this study , Toca - 1 was not required for transferrin internalization in HeLa cells [ 173 ] . In NK cells , CIP4 plays an important role in positioning of the microtubule organizing center for directed exocytosis of cytolytic granules [ 168 ] . However , there are many remaining questions regarding the cellular and biological functions of the CIP4 family adaptors in mammals . In this chapter , we provide novel insights into the contributions of mammalian CIP4 family adaptors in regulating EGFR trafficking , signaling and downregulation . We show that 44 while early events of CME are fully dependent on FBP17 , CIP4 and Toca - 1 regulate later events in vesicle trafficking . We show that CIP4 , like Toca - 1 , localizes to Rab5 / EEA1 - positive endosomes in both A431 epidermoid carcinoma and HeLa cells . Redistribution of CIP4 to giant endosomes occurs upon expression of constitutively active Rab5 . We provide evidence that the phosphoinositide - binding face of the F - BAR domain contributes to CIP4 localization to endosomes and for CIP4 - induced downregulation of EGFR . Depletion of CIP4 and Toca - 1 from A431 cells by RNAi caused a partial block in EGFR traffic from EEA1 - positive endosomes , without affecting levels of surface EGFR . This correlated with increased ERK activation and S - phase cells in A431 cells depleted of CIP4 and Toca - 1 , compared to control . Thus , CIP4 and Toca - 1 potentially regulate later events in EGFR endocytic trafficking that limits compartmentalized EGFR signaling . 2 . 3 Material and Methods Reagents . Rabbit polyclonal CIP4 antiserum was raised against full length , purified 6 - histidine - tagged human CIP4 within the Queen’s University Animal Care Services facility . Toca - 1 mouse monoclonal antibody was raised against amino acids 416 - 470 of human Toca - 1 fused to GST at the IFOM ( Milan , Italy ) .

Expression plasmids and mutagenesis . GFP fusion constructs have been previously described for FBP17 and Toca - 1 [ 133 ] , and Rab5 [ 192 ] . DsRed - Rab5 expression plasmid was described previously [ 193 ] . The effects of the Q79L mutation in Rab5 in endosome fusion was 45 described previously [ 181 , 182 ] . For CIP4 constructs , the entire coding sequence plus an N - terminal HA epitope tag was subcloned from pJ3H - CIP4 [ 131 ] into pEGFP - N3 , and verified by sequencing . The CIP4 F - BAR domain 5Q mutation ( R27K30K33R113K114 mutated to glutamines ) was generated in two steps using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) . Reactions were performed using pEGFP - CIP4 and pET - CIP4 plasmids as templates and the following primers : R113K114 / QQ for 5’ CAAGAGATGAAACAGGAGCAGCAGATGCATTTCCAAGAAGGGCGG - 3’ , R113K114 / QQ rev 5’ CCGCCCTTCTTGGAAATGCATCTGCTGCTCCTGTTTCATCTCTTG 3’ ; R27K30K33 / QQQ for 5’ GACCTGTTGGACCAATATGTACAGTTCGTGCAAGAACGCACCG 3’ ; R27K30K33 / QQQ rev 5’ CGGTGCGTTCTTGCACGAACTGTACATATTGGTCCAACAGGTC 3’ . Mutations were confirmed by sequencing . Cell culture , plasmid transfections and EGF stimulation . A431 , NIH - 3T3 , COS - 7 and HeLa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Sigma Aldrich ) , 1 % glutamine ( Invitrogen ) , and antimycotic / antibiotics ( Invitrogen ) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 . For EGF stimulation , cells were starved overnight in serum - free media ( 14 hours ) before treatment with EGF ( 1 . 5 , 100 , or 200 ng / ml ; specified in figure legends ) . For siRNA transfected cells , cells were starved for 4 hours at 72 hours post - transfection prior to EGF treatment . Transient transfections of A431 , COS - 7 , and HeLa cells with plasmid DNA was performed using FuGENE HD ( Roche Diagnostics Inc . ) , according to the manufacturer’s recommended conditions . siRNA sequences and transfections . For gene silencing experiments in HeLa cells , 2 sets of siRNA oligos specific for Toca - 1 , CIP4 , and FBP17 ( Stealth , Invitrogen ; or scrambled control 46 oligos ) were used to transfect HeLa cells according to suppliers ' instructions using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . The target sequences were : Toca - 1 5’ CGCACAGAGTGTATGGTGAATTAAT 3’ , 5’ CAGTGAGTGTTACAGAGGATTTGCT 3’ ; CIP4 5’ GAACCTCAGTGTCCGTGTATGTCTT 3’ , 5’ CCCACGTCCTTATAGAGCTGCACAA 3’ ; FBP17 5’CAAAGCAACTCAGGAATCTTTCAAA 3’ , 5’ CCAACCTGAACGAAATGAATGATTA 3’ .

A431 cells were plated at 30 % confluence one day before transfection and grown in media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) . For 12 well plates , cells were transfected with a mixture of 5 μ l of 20 μ M siRNA and 5 μ l of Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) were complexed according to the manufacture’s instructions and applied to each well in a total volume of 500 μ l DMEM ( 200 nM final concentration ) . At 5 hours post - transfection , an equal volume of DMEM / 20 % FBS / 2 % glutamine was added to the cells . Cdc42 pull down assay . Activated Cdc42 was analyzed using GST conjugated GTPase binding domain ( GBD ) of WASP which bind specifically to activated Cdc42 [ 194 ] . The GBD domain of WASP was amplified by PCR using a human WASP expression plasmid ( kindly provided by Anne Ridley , Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research , London , UK ) and the following primers ( 5 ' - CGCGGATCCGACATCCAGAACCCTGACATCACG - 3 ' and 5 ' - GTGAATTCATCGAGATGGCGGTG - 3 ' ) , followed by digestion with BamH1 and EcoR1 and cloning into pGex6P . 2 vector . The construct was sequence verified , and protein was purified from BL21 E . coli using Glutathione - Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer’s 47 instructions ( GE Healthcare ) . Aliquots of bead - bound GST - GBD were prepared and stored at - 80 ºC . A431 cells were seeded in 100 mm plates , prior to transfection with siRNA using Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) , as described above . At 3 days post - transfection , A431 cells were lysed in MLB [ 50mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 25 % sodium deoxycholate , 10 % glycerol , 25 mM NaF , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Sigma - Aldrich ) ] . Soluble cell lysates were incubated with GST - GBD beads ( containing ~ 10 μ g protein ) for 1 h at 4 ºC . For positive and negative controls , respectively , cell lysates were loaded with 0 . 1 mM GTP γ S or 1 mM GDP in the presence of 10 mM EDTA for 15 min at 30 ºC , and the reactions were terminated with 60 mM MgCl 2 before incubating with GST - GBD beads ( 10 μ g protein ) at 4 ºC for 30min . Beads were then washed with MLB for 3 times , and lysed with 2X SDS sample buffer . Proteins were separated by 12 % SDS - PAGE , and Cdc42 was detected by IB with anti - Cdc42 ( 1 : 200 ; B - 8 clone ; SCBT ) . Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry . Endogenous CIP4 immunoflourescence ( IF ) staining was performed on A431 cells attached to fibronectin - coated coverslips , that were serum starved prior to treatment with EGF ( or labeled EGF ) for the times indicated in Figure legends . For pulse / chase experiments , after 5 minute incubation with Texas Red - conjugated EGF cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated for the times indicated in figure legends . Cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde , permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Tween - 20 , blocked using 5 % goat serum ( Sigma Aldrich ) , and incubated with mouse anti - CIP4 ( BD Biosciences , 1 : 50 ) or mouse anti - Toca - 1 ( 1 : 20 ) at 4 ºC overnight . Following extensive washing in PBS / 0 . 2 % Tween - 20 , coverslips were incubated with Alexa 488 - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 400 ; Invitrogen ) at room temperature for an hour . After washing 5 times with PBS / 0 . 2 % Tween - 20 , coverslips were mounted on slides and analyzed by confocal microscopy ( HCX PL APO DIC 63X / 1 . 32 Oil CS 48 objective ; Leica TCS SP2 Multi Photon ; Queen’s Protein Function Discovery facility ) . CIP4 localization with Rab5 in A431 cells was assessed by IF staining with mouse anti - CIP4 ( 1 : 50 ) and rabbit anti - Rab5 ( 1 : 200 ; Applied Biological Materials ) . For detection , Alexa 488 - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG and Alexa 568 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( 1 : 400 ; Invitrogen ) were used . For HeLa cells transfected with Myc - tagged Rab5 Q79L expression plasmid , IF staining of CIP4 ( 1 : 200 ) or Toca - 1 ( 1 : 20 ) mouse monoclonals was used together with rabbit anti - Rab5 ( 1 : 50 ; SCBT ) . Following secondary antibody staining , cells were analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy . IF staining of GFP - Rab5 Q79L was performed on A431 cells grown on coverslips 48 hours post transfection with FuGENE HD . Cells were processed as described above prior to staining with rabbit anti - GFP ( 1 : 200 ; Chemicon ) together with either mouse anti - CIP4 ( 1 : 50 ) , or anti - EGFR ( BD Biosciences ) . For EGFR co - localization with EEA1 , rabbit anti - EGFR ( SCBT ) and mouse anti - EEA1 ( BD Biosciences ) were used on siRNA transfected A431 cells treated with EGF for 10 min . For EGFR co - localization with Lamp1 , mouse anti - EGFR and rabbit anti - Lamp1 were used on siRNA - transfected A431 cells treated with EGF for 30 min . Surface expression of EGFR was measured in siRNA - transfected A431 cells by staining with FITC - conjugated isotype or EGFR antibodies ( BD Biosciences ) . Following analysis of samples prepared in triplicate using a EPICS ALTRA HSS flow cytometer ( Cytometry and Imaging facilities , Queen’s Protein Function Discovery facility ) , the median fluorescence intensities for surface EGFR were determined . Total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . TIRF imaging of cells was performed by an Olympus Biosystem TIRF workstation based on Cell ^ R Imaging System . For excitation of Alexa 405 , Alexa 488 and Texas - Red , a 405 nm laser diode , a 488 nm Ar laser , and a 568 nm Kr laser were used , respectively , coupled to an inverted epifluorescence motorized 49 Olympus IX81 microscope , and focused at an off - axis position of the objective back focal plane . Cells plated on glass coverslips were viewed through a high - aperture 60x objective lens ( UIS2 60x TIRFM PlanApo N , NA 1 . 45 , Olympus ) with an additional 1 . 6x magnification lens . Images were acquired using an Orca - ER Cooled CCD digital camera ( Hamamatsu Italy ) . Endocytosis of EGFR in mammals . HeLa cells grown in 24 - well dishes were serum starved for 3 h before the addition of 1 . 5 ng / ml of 125 I - EGF in binding medium ( MEM with 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , and 0 . 1 % BSA ) for 2 , 4 , and 6 min at 37°C . The amount of surface - bound and internalized radioactivity was determined as previously described [ 19 ] . The rate of internalization is expressed as the ratio between internalized and surface 125 I - ligand for each time point . A low concentration of 125I - EGF was used to avoid saturation of the internalization machinery . Specific binding is reported for all data points . Non - specific binding was measured by adding a 200 - fold excess of cold EGF . Immunoblotting . Cells were lysed using Kinase Lysis Buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 10 µg of aprotinin / ml , 10 µg of leupeptin / ml , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 100 μ M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) . Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm , for 10 min at 4 ºC . Soluble cell lysates ( SCL ) were subjected to immunoblotting ( IB ) following the transfer of proteins to Immobilon P membranes ( Millipore ) using a semidry transfer apparatus ( Bio - Rad ) . Blots were probed with antibodies directed against : CIP4 ( 1 : 1000 ) , Toca - 1 ( 1 : 100 ) , EGFR ( 1 : 2500 ; BD Biosci . ) , active - EGFR ( pY - EGFR ; 1 : 1000 ; BD Biosci . ) , ERK1 / ERK2 ( ERK1 / 2 ; 1 : 1000 ; SCBT ) , phospho - ERK ( pERK ; 1 : 200 ; SCBT ) , phospho - Akt ( pAkt ; 1 : 1000 ; CST ) , Akt1 / 2 ( 1 : 1000 ; SCBT ) . Antibody complexes were detected with either horseradish peroxidase - conjugated sheep anti - mouse immunoglobulin ( 1 : 5000 ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) or horseradish peroxidase - conjugated 50 goat anti - rabbit immunoglobulin ( 1 : 10 , 000 ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) and revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ; Applied Biological Materials ) . Liposome sedimentation assays . Liposome binding assays were performed essentially as previously described [ 133 , 184 ] . Briefly , 6xHis - tagged full length CIP4 wild - type ( WT ) and 5Q were purified from BL21 E . coli using Ni 2 + - charged Chelating Sepharose ( GE Healthcare ) , dialyzed and subjected to centrifugation at 70 , 000 rpm for 15 min in a TL100 rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) to remove protein aggregates . Then 5 μ g of protein was incubated with 100 μ g liposomes ( containing either PC / PE / PS 75 % / 20 % / 5 % ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , with or without 10 % PI ( 3 ) P or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Echelon Biosciences Inc . ) ) in binding buffer [ 0 . 1 M sucrose , 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA ] for 15 min at 25 ºC . Following centrifugation at 60 , 000 rpm for 15 min at 25 ºC , supernatants and pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Coomassie brilliant blue staining of SDS - 11 % PAGE . BrdU incorporation assay . Following 72h of siRNA transfection ( as described above ) , BrdU was added to the medium to a final concentration of 10 μ M . Following a 2 hour - incubation , cells were rinsed with PBS , collected using trypsin , and fixed in 70 % of ethanol overnight at 4 ºC . Cells were pelleted by centrifugation , ethanol removed by aspiration , and resuspended in PBS containing 0 . 1 mg / ml RNaseA for 30 min at room temperature . Cells were counted and 10 6 cells were permeabilized in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and treated with 4N HCl for 30 min at room temperature . Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of 0 . 1 M sodium borate ( pH 8 . 5 ) for 5 min at room temperature . Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 80 μ l of PBS / 2 % goat serum / 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 and 20 μ l FITC - conjugated anti - BrdU ( BD Bioscience ) and incubated overnight at 4 ºC . Samples were diluted to 5 ml in PBS , pelleted and resuspended in propidium iodide ( PI ; 10 μ g / ml ) / RNase A ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ) , and incubated at 37 ºC for 20 min 51 protected from light . Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry ( EPICS ALTRA HSS ; Queen’s Protein Function Discovery facility ) . At least 10 , 000 cells were analyzed to determine the percentage of cells in S phase ( BrdU + ) . Statistical and image analysis . Differences between experimental groups were examined for statistical significance ( P < 0 . 05 ) using paired Student’s T - test in Excel ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA , USA ) . The ImageJ image - analysis software ( W . Rasband , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , USA ) was used for quantitative analysis of colocalization on an average of 10 - 15 cells for each condition . Background intensity was initially subtracted by placing “Regions of Interest” ( ROI ) over areas devoid of specific signal . The colocalization analysis plug - in ( T . Collins , WCIF , Toronto Western Research Institute , Toronto , Canada ) provided the reported Pearson Correlation Coefficient , Manders’ Overlap Coefficients ( MOC ) [ 195 ] together with the percentage of colocalized intensity per each channel . Manders’ overlap coefficients and colocalizing intensity pixels were calculated above a specific intensity threshold ( subsequently normalized to total channel intensity ) giving the best Pearson Correlation Coefficient , in the hypothesis of a linear dependence between channels . 2 . 4 Results 2 . 4 . 1 Distinct functions of CIP4 family adaptors in CME of EGFR Although CIP4 family adaptors are implicated in promoting early events in CME , the relative contributions of CIP4 and Toca - 1 are not well defined compared to FBP17 [ 134 , 136 ] . To compare the localization of CIP4 family adaptors to CCPs , NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with GFP fusion constructs for CIP4 family adaptors and analyzed for their co - localization with clathrin heavy chain by TIRF microscopy ( Fig . 2 . 1A ) . FBP17 - GFP localized 52 in a punctate pattern at the plasma membrane , with co - localization detected with ≈ 24 % of clathrin spots ( Fig . 2 . 1A , panels a - d ) . In contrast , little or no co - localization was detected between CIP4 - GFP or Toca - 1 - GFP puncta and clathrin spots ( Fig . 2 . 1A , panels e - l ) . Thus , despite expression of all CIP4 family adaptors at the plasma membrane , only FBP17 showed localization to CCPs . To test directly for functions of CIP4 family adaptors in CME , we measured the endocytic constants of internalization of EGFR after stimulation with limiting doses of EGF ( 1 . 5 ng / ml ) in HeLa cells where the levels of Toca - 1 , FBP17 and CIP4 were reduced by RNAi . Previous studies show that EGFR enters cells exclusively via CME under these conditions [ 19 , 20 ] . Measurement of EGFR internalization by CME revealed that the individual downregulation of FBP17 ( FBP17 KD ) , but not of CIP4 or Toca - 1 , caused a significant decrease in EGFR internalization compared to control siRNA transfectants ( Fig . 2 . 1b ; p < 0 . 01 ) . Importantly , no additional defects were observed upon depletion of all three CIP4 family adaptors ( Fig . 2 . 1b ; 3KD ) . Determination of the initial rates of EGFR internalization revealed a signicant decrease ( ≈ 35 % ) in the endocytic rate constant for FBP17 KD ( Ke 0 . 22 min - 1 ) and triple KD cells ( 0 . 20 min - 1 ) compared to control cells ( Ke 0 . 32 min - 1 ) . The efficiency of FBP17 KD ( Fig . 2 . 1C ) , CIP4 , and Toca - 1 KD ( Fig . 2 . 1D ) was confirmed by immunoblotting . Thus , FBP17 is the sole CIP4 family member required for early events of CME , at least when EGFR is used as cargo , and raises the possibility of distinct roles of CIP4 and Toca - 1 in membrane trafficking . 2 . 4 . 2 CIP4 localizes to EGFR - and Rab5 - containing endosomes Although CIP4 and Toca - 1 were not required for early mechanisms of EGFR internalization by CME , we tested whether CIP4 and Toca - 1 may participate in later events , such as trafficking of EGFR - containing vesicles . Using A431 Epidermoid carcinoma cells pulsed with 53 Figure 2 . 1 . FBP17 is the key CIP4 family adaptor promoting EGFR internalization by CME . ( A ) , NIH - 3T3 cells transfected with either GFP - FBP17 ( panels a - d ) , GFP - CIP4 ( panels e - h ) , or GFP - Toca - 1 ( panels i - l ) constructs were fixed and stained with anti - clathrin heavy chain antibodies and analyzed by confocal TIRF microscopy to reveal their plasma membrane localization . Boxed areas are shown at high magnification on the right ( panels d , h , l ) . Merge indicates overlay of green and red channels , with co - localization indicated by yellow color . Scale bar indicates 10 μ m . ( B ) , HeLa cells transfected with the indicated siRNA specific for CIP4 , Toca - 1 or FBP17 ( alone or in combination ) or with a scrambled control siRNA were incubated with 1 . 5 ng / ml 125 I - EGF . The rate of internalization is expressed as internalized / surface - bound radioactivity . The indicated P value was obtained by linear regression analysis . Results are the average of triplicate points ( SEM < 15 % ) and representative of four to five independent experiments . Internalization constants ( Ke ) were measured under the indicated conditions as described above . The total number of EGFR / cell under the various conditions tested was constant and equal to 3 . 8 ± 0 . 3 x 10 5 / cell . Results are the average from four independent experiments ± 95 % CI ( confidence interval ) . Similar results were obtained with three independent oligos . ( C ) , IB of lysates from siRNA - transfected HeLa cells was performed to assess FBP17 level , relative to vinculin as a loading control . ( D ) , IB of lysates from siRNA - transfected HeLa cells was performed to assess CIP4 and Toca - 1 levels , relative to vinculin as a loading control . 54 labelled EGF , we tested whether CIP4 and Toca - 1 localize to EGFR - containing vesicles . Immunofluorescence ( IF ) detection of CIP4 in A431 cells pulsed with EGF ( 5 min chase period ) showed CIP4 - containing puncta near the cell periphery that partially co - localized with EGF - containing vesicles ( Fig . 2 . 2A ; panels a - c , 53 . 9 ± 8 . 0 % co - localization , n = 20 ) . Similar results were observed for Toca - 1 puncta near the cell periphery that partially co - localized with EGFR - containing vesicles ( Fig . 2 . 2A ; panels d - f , 44 . 3 ± 1 . 8 % co - localization , n = 20 ) . Since less co - localization was observed at later times post EGF - treatment ( Fig . 2 . 2B ) , we tested CIP4 localization relative to Rab5 , a key regulator of early vesicle maturation and vesicle fusion [ 180 ] . In HeLa cells transfected with a dsRed - Rab5 , we tested for co - localization with endogenous CIP4 . While little co - localization of dsRed - Rab5 and CIP4 was evident in serum starved HeLa cells ( Fig . 2 . 3A , panels a - c ; 14 . 8 ± 4 % co - localization , n = 20 ) , EGF treatment for 10 minutes led to more prominent co - localization of CIP4 with dsRed - Rab5 ( Fig . 2 . 3A , panels d - f ; 54 . 9 ± 4 % co - localization , n = 20 ) . A parallel analysis in A431 cells was performed comparing localization of endogenous Rab5 and CIP4 . We observed a partial co - localization of CIP4 puncta with Rab5 - positive vesicles , and this was enhanced slightly following EGF treatment for 10 minutes ( Fig . 2 . 3B ; panels a - c , 33 . 7 ± 2 . 2 % co - localization , n = 20 ; panels d - f , 42 . 6 ± 2 . 7 % co - localization , n = 20 ) . Taken together , these results show that CIP4 associates with EGFR - and Rab5 - positive endocytic vesicles . To determine whether CIP4 localization to endosomes was regulated by Rab5 , we tested effects of constitutively active Rab5 ( Q79L ) expression , that induces formation of giant early endosomes [ 181 , 182 ] , on CIP4 localization . As expected , GFP - Rab5 Q79L - expressing A431 cells contained numerous GFP - positive giant endosomes within the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2 . 4 , panel a ) . 55 Expression of GFP - Rab5 Q79L caused a redistribution of CIP4 into enlarged endosomes expressing GFP - Rab5 ( Fig . 2 . 4 , panels b - c ; 61 . 1 ± 14 . 8 % co - localization ; n = 20 ) .

EGF - induced CIP4 localization to Rab5 - containing vesicles in HeLa and A431 cells . ( A ) , HeLa cells transfected with dsRed - Rab5 plasmid were serum starved , and treated with or without EGF ( 100 ng / ml ) for 10 min .

Cells were fixed and stained with mouse anti - CIP4 ( green ) and rabbit anti - Rab5 ( red ) , and representative confocal microscopy images are shown . Merge indicates overlay of green and red channels , with co - localization indicated by yellow color . Higher magnification views of boxed areas are shown , with arrows indicating co - localization . Scale bar indicates 10 μ m . 58 CIP4 and GFP - Rab5 Q79L across these giant endosomes highly correlated ( shown on the right ) , suggesting that CIP4 is not randomly localized but accumulates to the early endosomes . GFP - Rab5 Q79L - induced giant endosomes also contained EGFR ( Fig . 2 . 4 , panels d - f ) and phosphorylated ERK ( pERK ; Fig . 2 . 4 , panels g - i ) . A parallel analysis in HeLa cells transfected with a Myc - tagged Rab5 Q79L expression plasmid revealed co - localization of endogenous CIP4 with Rab5 - positive giant endosomes in HeLa cells ( Fig . 2 . 5 , panels a - c , 73 . 9 ± 6 % co - localization ; see intensity profile for representative enlarged endosome ) . Likewise , endogenous Toca - 1 was detected within Rab5 - positive enlarged early endosomes in Rab5 Q79L - expressing HeLa cells ( Fig . 2 . 5 , panels d - f , 57 . 7 ± 12 % co - localization ) . Taken together , these results provide evidence that CIP4 and Toca - 1 localize to endosomes induced by Rab5 activation . 2 . 4 . 3 Phosphoinositide binding via the CIP4 F - BAR domain contributes to endosome localization Based on mutagenesis and structural studies [ 134 , 145 ] , a cluster of basic residues in the CIP4 F - BAR dimer ( R27K30K33K110R113K114 ) have been implicated in direct binding of phosphoinositides in curved membranes ( Fig . 2 . 6 , A ) . We mutated 5 of these basic residues to glutamines ( R27K30K33R113K114 to 5Q ) within the CIP4 F - BAR domain to disrupt these central phosphoinositide - binding pockets on the concave face of the F - BAR dimer ( Fig . 2 . 6A ; basic residues indicated by blue color ; positions of mutated residues in each monomeric subunit are indicated by solid and dashed ovals ) . We tested the effects of the 5Q mutation on binding of full length CIP4 to PE / PC / PS - based liposomes ( control ) supplemented with either PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or PI ( 3 ) P , a lipid enriched within Rab5 - containing endosomes [ 196 ] . Histidine - tagged CIP4 wild - type ( WT ) and 5Q proteins were purified from E . coli , and subjected to liposome sedimentation 59 Figure 2 . 4 . CIP4 localizes to giant endosomes induced by constitutively active Rab5 . A431 cells were transiently transfected with GFP - Rab5 Q79L , IF staining was performed to determine the localization of endogenous CIP4 , EGFR , and phosphorylated ERK ( pERK ; all shown in red ) . Merge indicates overlay of green and red channels , with co - localization indicated by yellow color . Higher magnification views are provided as well as the intensity profiles of green and red channels across selected giant endosomes are shown on the right . Scale bars depict 10 μ m . 60 Figure 2 . 5 . CIP4 and Toca - 1 localize to Rab5 Q79L - induced giant endosomes in HeLa cells . HeLa cells were transiently transfected with Myc - tagged Rab5 Q79L expression plasmid prior to IF staining with rabbit anti - Rab5 and mouse anti - CIP4 or anti - Toca - 1 . Representative epifluorescence images are shown for Rab5 ( red ) , and endogenous CIP4 or Toca - 1 ( green ) . Merge indicates overlay of green and red channels , with co - localization indicated by yellow color . Higher magnification views are provided in the upper left of each panel as well as the intensity profiles of green and red channels across selected giant endosomes are shown on the right . Scale bar depict 10 μ m . 61 assays . CIP4 WT was found mostly in the pellet ( P ) fraction compared to the supernatant ( S ) following sedimentation with liposomes containing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 ) P , compared to control liposomes ( Fig . 2 . 6 , B ; lanes 1 - 2 ; compare top panel to lower panels ) . In contrast , CIP4 5Q displayed limited binding to any of the liposomes ( Fig . 2 . 6 , B ; lanes 3 - 4 ) . Quantification of 3 independent experiments revealed a significant decrease in phosphoinositide binding in vitro for CIP4 5Q , compared to CIP4 WT ( Fig . 2 . 6 , C ) . The effects of the 5Q mutation on CIP4 - induced liposome tubulation was assessed using PI ( 3 ) P - containing liposomes ( Fig . 2 . 6 , D ) . While CIP4 WT formed prominent tubules , we detected fewer tubules of reduced total length with CIP4 5Q ( Fig . 2 . 6 , D ; see graph below micrographs for quantification ) . To examine the effects of the 5Q mutation on CIP4 - induced membrane tubulation in vivo , live cell imaging was performed on COS - 7 cells expressing GFP - CIP4 WT or GFP - CIP4 5Q fusion proteins . Consistent with previous studies [ 133 , 145 ] , GFP - CIP4 WT overexpression led to extensive tubulation of cellular membranes ( Fig . 2 . 6 , E , top panel ) . In contrast , GFP - CIP4 5Q displayed a more diffuse expression pattern and had less tubulating activity towards cellular membranes ( Fig . 2 . 6 , E , bottom panel ) . Next , we tested whether the concave , phosphoinositide - binding face of the CIP4 F - BAR domain contributes to its localization to Rab5 - containing endosomes . GFP - CIP4 WT and GFP - CIP4 5Q fusion proteins were expressed in COS - 7 cells and localization was assessed relative to EEA1 , a Rab5 effector and marker of early endosomes , by confocal microscopy . COS - 7 cells were used due to high transfection efficiency , a flat morphology with large amounts of cytoplasm allowing better visualization of endomembrane structures , and since they were previously utilized for the analysis of tubulation activity of F - BAR proteins [ 133 , 135 , 184 ] . Consistent with previous studies [ 133 , 145 ] , GFP - CIP4 WT localized to both the plasma membrane and to tubular structures within the cytoplasm of COS - 7 cells ( Fig . 2 . 7 , A , panel a ) . It is worth noting 62 Figure 2 . 6 . The 5Q mutation in the CIP4 F - BAR domain disrupts phosphoinositide binding and membrane tubulation . ( A ) , A surface representation of the CIP4 F - BAR dimer [ 136 ] was prepared in Pymol depicting basic residues in blue , and acidic residues in red . The concave , phosphoinositide - binding face is shown for CIP4 wild - type ( WT ) the CIP4 5Q mutant ( R27K30K33R113K114 mutated to 5Q ) that disrupts two central binding pockets in the F - BAR dimer ( indicated by solid and dashed ovals ) . ( B ) , Liposome sedimentation assays were performed with recombinant , purified his - tagged CIP4 WT and 5Q using PC / PE / PS - based liposomes ( 75 % / 20 % / 5 % ) supplemented with or without PI ( 3 ) P or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 10 % final concentration ) , as described in Experimental Procedures . Following ultracentrifugation , the supernatant ( S ) and pellet ( P ) fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie blue staining . ( C ) , Graph depicts the mean value for the fraction bound ( ± SD ) for 3 independent experiments ( asterisks indicates significant difference ( p < 0 . 05 ) from WT ) . ( D ) , Liposome tubulation assays were performed as described in Materials and methods . Representative micrographs of PI ( 3 ) P - containing liposomes incubated with CIP4 WT and CIP4 5Q are shown . Graph presents the quantification of total number and length of tubules for 30 separate fields using Image J software . Asterisk indicates a significant reduction in total and average tubule length for CIP4 5Q relative to WT ( p < 0 . 01 ) . ( E ) , Representative confocal images from live cell imaging of COS - 7 cells expressing GFP - CIP4 WT ( upper panel ) and GFP - CIP4 5Q ( lower panel ) . Scale bar indicates 10 μ m . 63 that fewer CIP4 - induced tubules are evident following fixation and IF staining , than those detected in live cell imaging ( Fig . 2 . 6 , E ) . However , some EEA1 - positive endosomes co - localized with CIP4 - containing tubules or puncta ( Fig . 2 . 7 , A , indicated by arrows in panels b - d ) . The intensity profile across these puncta shows a positive correlation ( Fig . 2 . 7 , A ) . GFP - CIP4 5Q localized in a more diffuse pattern within the cytoplasm compared to GFP - CIP4 WT , but did retain some localization to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2 . 7 , A , panel e , indicated by arrow ) . This is likely due to the recently described side - binding face of the F - BAR domain for flat membranes [ 145 ] . However , GFP - CIP4 5Q showed reduced co - localization with EEA1 - positive endosomes ( Fig . 2 . 7 , A , panels f - h ) . The intensity profiles across EEA1 - containing early endosomes shows less correlation between GFP - CIP4 5Q and EEA1 , compared to that of GFP - CIP4 WT . The percent EEA1 co - localization with GFP - CIP4 was quantified for 30 transfected cells , and this revealed a significant reduction in EEA1 co - localization with GFP - CIP4 5Q , compared to GFP - CIP4 WT ( Fig . 2 . 7 , B ) . The expression levels of GFP - CIP4 WT and GFP - CIP4 5Q were similar , based on immunoblotting ( Fig . 2 . 7 , C ) . Similar contributions of the CIP4 F - BAR domain were observed in CIP4 localization to giant endosomes in HeLa cells transfected with Rab5 Q79L ( Fig . 2 . 8 ) . Thus , we conclude that the concave , phosphoinositide - binding face of the CIP4 F - BAR domain contributes to , but is not the sole determinant of early endosome localization of CIP4 . 2 . 4 . 4 CIP4 promotes EGFR downregulation Since CIP4 localized to EGF / Rab5 / EEA1 - positive early endosomes that likely participate in EGFR recycling or targeting to lysosomes , we tested whether CIP4 regulates EGFR downregulation . HeLa cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding GFP ( vector ) , GFP - CIP4 WT , and GFP - CIP4 5Q . Interestingly , a ≈ 60 % reduction in steady state EGFR levels was observed relative to Tubulin ( Tub ) in GFP - CIP4 WT expressing cells compared to vector 64 Figure 2 . 7 . Contributions of CIP4 F - BAR domain to early endosome localization .

Positions of endogenous CIP4 and GFP - CIP4 are shown on the left along with positions of molecular mass markers . 65 Figure 2 . 8 . F - BAR domain of CIP4 contributes to localization to Rab5 Q79L - induced giant endosomes .

Percent co - localization analysis for 20 cells is shown on the right ( mean ± sem ; * indicates p < 0 . 05 ) . 66 controls ( Fig . 2 . 9 A ) . In contrast , expression of GFP - CIP4 5Q had no significant effect on EGFR steady state levels in HeLa cells ( Fig . 2 . 9 A ; see graph for quantification ) . To examine potential effects of CIP4 on EGF - induced downregulation of EGFR , we performed similar transfections prior to serum starvation , and EGF treatment for 0 , 0 . 5 , and 6 hours ( h ) in HeLa cells . In vector transfectants , we observed the expected pattern of EGFR downregulation following EGF treatment ( Fig . 2 . 9 B ) . Upon expression of GFP - CIP4 WT , but not GFP - CIP4 5Q , we observed a significant reduction in EGFR levels at time 0 and 0 . 5 h compared to vector transfectants ( Fig . 2 . 9B ; see graph for quantification ) . Taken together , these results provide novel evidence for a role of CIP4 and its F - BAR domain in promoting EGFR downregulation . As an alternative approach , we depleted CIP4 in A431 cells by siRNA - mediated silencing . CIP4 protein levels were reduced by ≈ 80 % compared to a GFP - specific control siRNA ( Fig . 2 . 9C ) . Interestingly , the relative levels of EGFR and activated EGFR ( pY - EGFR ) were consistently elevated ( 1 . 5 - 2 fold compared to ERK ) in CIP4 - silenced A431 cells compared to control cells ( Fig . 2 . 9C ) . Similar results were obtained with 2 independent pairs of control and CIP4 siRNAs ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the effects of CIP4 silencing on EGFR were not due to off - target effects . Since Cdc42 GTP levels positively correlate with EGFR levels in breast cancer cells [ 197 ] , and CIP4 can interact with a Cdc42 GAP called RICH - 1 [ 57 ] , we tested whether Cdc42 GTP levels were altered upon downregulation of CIP4 . However , we observed no significant differences in Cdc42 GTP levels were observed between control and CIP4 siRNA - transfected A431 cells ( Fig . 2 . 9D , see Fig . 2 . 9E for quantification ) . Thus , CIP4 regulates EGFR downregulation , independent of regulation of Cdc42 activation . 67 Figure 2 . 9 . CIP4 regulates EGFR downregulation via its F - BAR domain . ( A ) , Hela cells were transfected with pEGFP - N3 vector , GFP - CIP4 WT and GFP - CIP4 5Q plasmids , and lysates prepared at 48h post transfection . IB were performed with anti - EGFR , anti - α - Tubulin ( Tub ) , and anti - CIP4 . Relative intensity of EGFR compated to Tubulin was determined by densitometry .

At 48 hours post - transfection lysates were prepared and analyzed for GTP - loading of Cdc42 as described in Materials and Methods . For the positive and negative controls , lysates were loaded with GTP γ S or GDP , respectively . Pull - down assays were performed with the GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) from WASP to analyze Cdc42 GTP levels by IB with anti - Cdc42 . Total Cdc42 levels were revealed by IB of the same lysates obtained from control or CIP4 siRNA - transfected cells . ( E ) , Densitometry was performed for three separate experiments and the relative levels of Cdc42 GTP / Cdc42 are shown as mean ± standard deviation . 68 2 . 4 . 5 CIP4 and Toca - 1 regulate EGFR trafficking and compartmentalized signaling in A431 cells To gain insights into how CIP4 regulates EGFR levels , we investigated the localization of EGFR on the plasma membrane , and with EEA1 ( a marker for early endosomes ) or Lamp1 ( a marker for late endosomes and lysosomes ) . Since both CIP4 and Toca - 1 localized to Rab5 - positive vesicles , we also extended these experiments to silencing of both CIP4 and Toca - 1 in A431 cells . Compared to control siRNA transfectants , silencing of CIP4 or Toca - 1 individually or together , had no significant effect on steady state levels of EGFR on the surface of A431 cells , as measured by flow cytometry ( Fig . 2 . 10A ; see Fig . 2 . 10B for quantification from 3 separate experiments ) . Internalization of EGFR to EEA1 - positive membranes was tested for siRNA - transfectants treated with EGF for 10 minutes ( Fig . 2 . 10C ) . Interestingly , a significant increase in EGFR localization to EEA1 - positive endosomes was observed upon silencing of CIP4 and Toca - 1 individually or combined silencing , compared to control siRNA ( Fig . 2 . 10C ; panels a - d ; see Fig . 2 . 10D for quantification of EGFR / EEA1 co - localization ) . Similar results were obtained with 2 separate siRNAs against CIP4 , compared to control siRNA transfectants ( data not shown ) . A parallel analysis of EGFR co - localization with Lamp1 + lysosomes in siRNA transfectants treated with EGF for 30 minutes , demonstrated a significant decrease in lysosomal - targeting of EGFR in CIP4 / Toca - 1 - silenced cells compared to control cells ( Fig . 2 . 10C ; panels e - h ; see Fig . 2 . 10D for quantification of EGFR / Lamp1 co - localization ) . Immunoblots confirmed that CIP4 and Toca - 1 levels were reduced by > 80 % in the individual or combined siRNA transfectants , compared to control cells ( Fig . 2 . 10E ) . These results suggest that CIP4 and Toca - 1 may promote trafficking of EGFR from Rab5 / EEA1 - positive endosomes to lysosomes and likely contributes to the increased EGFR expression levels upon CIP4 silencing . 69 Figure 2 . 10 . CIP4 and Toca - 1 regulate trafficking of internalized EGFR .

( D ) , Co - localization analysis ( % intensity above threshold ± sem ; n = 50 cells ; asterisks indicate significant differences from control siRNA ( * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 ) ) . ( E ) , Lysates prepared from siRNA - transfected A431 cells ( as indicated ) were subjected to IB with CIP4 , Toca - 1 and ERK antibodies . Positions of molecular mass markers are shown on the left . 70 Next , we tested the effects of CIP4 and Toca - 1 silencing on signaling and growth of A431 cells . EGFR levels were slightly , but significantly elevated in cells depleted of CIP4 or Toca - 1 ( Fig . 2 . 11A ) . This correlated with increased phosphorylation of the downstream kinases Akt and ERK , which increased most markedly in dual CIP4 / Toca - 1 KD cells ( Fig . 2 . 11B ) . Interestingly , elevated pAkt was only observed upon silencing of Toca - 1 and combined silencing of CIP4 / Toca - 1 ( Fig . 2 . 11B ) , while no significant differences were observed in EGFR signaling to p38 kinase ( data not shown ) . Since early endosome - localized EGFR has been linked to sustained activation of the Akt and ERK pathways [ 178 ] , the altered trafficking of EGFR in CIP4 / Toca - 1 - depleted cells may account for these differences . Since sustained Akt and ERK activation promotes cell proliferation , we tested whether silencing of CIP4 or Toca - 1 altered the proliferative capacity of A431 cells using BrdU incorporation as an indicator of S phase progression . Silencing of CIP4 or Toca - 1 individually resulted in a significant increase in S phase cells , compared to control siRNA ( Fig . 2 . 11C ) . The combined silencing of CIP4 and Toca - 1 showed a further increase S phase cells , compared to control cells , suggesting a partially overlapping contribution of CIP4 and Toca - 1 ( Fig . 2 . 11C ) . Collectively , these results implicate CIP4 and Toca - 1 in regulating EGFR trafficking and downregulation , which serves to limit mitogenic signaling in A431 cells . 2 . 5 Discussion F - BAR - containing adaptor proteins like CIP4 and Toca - 1 regulate membrane reorganization via their abilities to both induce membrane curvature and recruit actin - regulatory proteins ( Reviewed in Ref . [ 126 - 128 ] ) . In this chapter , we present novel evidence that CIP4 is localized to early endosomes and that this requires , at least in part , the phosphoinositide binding 71 Figure 2 . 11 . Silencing of CIP4 and Toca - 1 regulates EGFR signaling and S phase entry in A431 cells .

( C ) , A431 cells were transfected as described above , prior to performing BrdU incorporation assays at 72 hours post - transfection ( see Experimental Procedures for details ) .

Accumulation of PI ( 3 ) P within early endosomes is dependent on Rab5 [ 196 ] , and we show here that constitutively active Rab5 causes CIP4 and Toca - 1 to accumulate in enlarged endosomes . These results presented here for CIP4 are also similar to a recent study showing that Toca - 1 localizes to Rab5 - containing vesicles [ 198 ] . Our results suggest that CIP4 and Toca - 1 play functional roles in the early endosome compartment due to the elevated levels of EGFR in early endosomes and a reduction in its targeting to lysosomes upon RNAi - mediated silencing of CIP4 and Toca - 1 . It is worth noting that Cdc42 and its effector activated Cdc42 - associated kinase 1 have been localized to early endosomes [ 190 , 199 ] , and both proteins have been implicated in regulating EGFR downregulation [ 64 , 199 ] . Given the recently reported role of Cdc42 in regulating vesicular trafficking [ 152 , 190 , 191 ] , it will be important to dissect the potential binding partners of CIP4 and Toca - 1 in these endocytic compartments . The primary role for FBP17 at CCPs is likely based on its co - localization with clathrin [ 136 ] , and that no significant co - localization of CIP4 or Toca - 1 with plasma membrane clathrin was detectable by TIRF . However , clathrin coats have been detected within early and late endosomes containing EGFR , as well as giant endosomes induced by Rab5 Q79L [ 200 ] . In future , it will be important to define whether CIP4 or Toca - 1 co - localize with endosomal clathrin coats involved in EGFR trafficking , and whether this requires their F - BAR domains . Interestingly , a recent study identified distinct preferences of the F - BAR domains of FBP17 and Toca - 1 towards smaller or larger phospholipid - containing vesicles , respectively [ 156 ] . This could reflect better binding of Toca - 1 to membranes with larger curvature such as the early endosome , compared to smaller clathrin - coated vesicles with a higher degree of curvature . Interestingly , a recent study implicates EGFR internalization via CME in its recycling , and not for degradation [ 19 ] . Together with our findings for CIP4 and Toca - 1 in regulating EGFR downregulation , 73 independent of internalization via CME , it will be important to investigate whether CIP4 and Toca - 1 regulate NCE mechanisms that regulate EGFR internalization , trafficking , and degradation . Future studies are needed to address the precise functions of endosome - localized F - BAR proteins in regulating endocytic trafficking of receptors , and whether there are distinct mechanisms for different classes of receptors . The identification of protein and lipid ligands of CIP4 and Toca - 1 within this compartment will be important to define . For example , do their well defined SH3 domain - binding partners N - WASP and dynamin allow them to promote vesicle scission from tubular endosomal membranes during later steps in vesicle recycling or trafficking ? Or is there a distinct repertoire of binding partners for CIP4 and Toca - 1 on endosomal membranes ? One possibility is sorting nexin 2 ( SNX2 ) , a PX - BAR domain - containing sorting nexin that is implicated in regulating EGFR trafficking [ 201 ] , and was previously identified as a potential ligand of the FBP17 HR1 domain [ 183 ] . Similar to our results for CIP4 ( this chapter ) , SNX2 was shown to localize with EEA1 - positive early endosomes and Rab5 Q79L - induced giant endosomes [ 201 ] . It will be interesting to explore the potential physical and functional interactions between CIP4 family adaptors and PX - BAR domain - containing proteins like SNX2 in regulating dynamic tubular structures from early endosomes important in receptor trafficking [ 202 ] . Another potential CIP4 family binding partner that could be relevant to a role in EGFR trafficking is GAPEX - 5 , a Rab5 GEF that along with CIP4 regulates glucose transport in adipocytes [ 158 , 159 ] . Interestingly , a recent study showed that silencing of CIP4 by RNAi diminished GTP loading of Rab5 following expression of constitutively active TC10 [ 158 ] . Thus , it will be interesting to determine whether GAPEX - 5 interacts with CIP4 family adaptors , 74 and whether regulation of Rab5 activity in CIP4 / Toca - 1 depleted cells accounts for altered trafficking of EGFR . Previous studies have established that early endosome - localized EGFR promotes more sustained activation of the Ras - ERK pathway compared to surface EGFR , and this sustained activation is critical for cell proliferation [ 177 , 178 ] . This is consistent with the ability of dominant negative Rab5 blocking internalization of EGFR , activation of ERK , and cell proliferation [ 37 ] . Thus , regulators of EGFR trafficking to and from early endosomes play critical roles in regulating the cellular response to EGFR ligands . In future , it will be important to study the functional interactions between the F - BAR domains with PI ( 3 ) P - rich early endosomes , and whether these proteins are involved in formation of tubular extensions from early endosomes important for sorting of receptor cargo . These structures have been previously reported for sorting nexins , as components of retromer [ 202 ] . Recent studies have implicated PI ( 3 ) P binding via the PX - BAR domains of sorting nexins as the critical step for assembling the retromer complex [ 203 ] . Interestingly , PX - BAR domain - containing SNX9 has recently been shown to form filaments on tubular structures [ 204 ] , which is similar to that described recently for F - BAR domains [ 145 ] . In future , it will important to investigate whether F - BAR and PX - BAR domain - containing proteins function synergistically in regulating the dynamic process of receptor sorting in early endosomes . Overall , our work provides new insights into a EGFR trafficking via the CIP4 protein , mediated in part via its F - BAR domain’s ability to bind PI ( 3 ) P in early endosomes . We provide evidence that CIP4 and Toca - 1 localize to Rab5 - containing endosomes , and this is mediated in part via its F - BAR domain . Depletion of CIP4 and Toca - 1 expression in A431 cells by RNAi modulates EGFR steady state levels . This correlated with increase in EGFR localization to 75 EEA1 - positive endosomes and decrease in EGFR localization to lysosomes in A431 cells following CIP4 and Toca - 1 silencing . 76 Chapter 3 The F - BAR Adaptor Toca - 1 Coordinates Lamellipodial Actin Assembly to Promote Epidermal Growth Factor - Induced Migration of A431 Cells 3 . 1 Abstract Transducer of Cdc42 - dependent actin assembly ( Toca - 1 ) promotes filamentous actin branching via the Cdc42 / N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 pathway . Toca - 1 can also interact with Abi1 and thereby potentially regulate the Rac / WAVE / Arp2 / 3 pathway , and thereby potentially coordinate the localized signaling of Cdc42 and Rac GTPases within lamellipodia of migrating cells . Here , we show that consistent with its proposed role in actin assembly , Toca - 1 co - localizes with F - actin and Arp2 / 3 complex within lamellipodia in A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells . To test the role of Toca - 1 , we established stable Toca - 1 knock - down ( KD ) A431 cell lines by RNA interference , which display normal growth rates and surface Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor expression . Compared to control cells , Toca - 1 KD cells form less lamellipodia in response to Epidermal Growth Factor ( EGF ) , and reduced cell motility . These defects may be due to a partial block in Abi1 and Arp2 / 3 complex recruitment to lamellipodia in Toca - 1 KD cells , compared to that observed in control cells . Together with evidence for EGF - induced Toca1 / Abi1 complex formation in A431 cells , these results implicate Toca - 1 in promoting Abi1 recruitment to lamellipodia to coordinate actin branching and promote EGF - induced cell migration . 3 . 2 Introduction Directional cell migration requires that signals from extracellular chemotactic factors be relayed to cytoplasmic proteins that regulate the shape of both membranes and the cytoskeleton . This leads to polarization of the cell with a broad , protrusive leading edge and narrow trailing 77 edge . At the leading edge , the protrusive structures include filopodia containing parallel bundles of F - actin , and sheet - like protrusions of membrane called lamellipodia that are supported by a lattice of branched F - actin [ 205 ] . While Cdc42 GTPase is key for the formation of filopodia [ 206 ] , both Cdc42 and Rac are required for formation of lamellipodia [ 52 ] , and are required for efficient cell migration [ 207 ] . In lamellipodia , Cdc42 binding to Neural Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) leads to recruitment of Actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex that nucleates new actin filaments on the side of existing filaments that help support the extension of membrane protrusions . Rac GTPase also promotes actin assembly within lamellipodia via the Specifically Rac - associated protein ( Sra - 1 ) / Nck - associated protein ( Nap1 ) / Abelson - interactor - 1 ( Abi ) / Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin - homologous protein ( WAVE ) complex . Abi1 regulates Rac activation via SOS - 1 , which functions as a Rac Guanine - nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) when bound to Eps8 and Abi1 [ 208 ] . Toca - 1 is an adaptor protein that may coordinate actin assembly via both the Cdc42 and Rac pathways based on observations that have been made in several model systems [ 81 , 101 , 153 ] . Toca - 1 ( also known as FNBP1L ) is an adaptor protein that was first identified as an essential co - factor for Cdc42 - induced actin assembly via N - WASP in Xenopus tropicalis [ 81 ] . Toca - 1 is a member of the Pombe Cdc15 Homology ( PCH ) family of proteins that all share phosphoinositide - binding Fer / CIP4 Homology ( FCH ) - Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) ( F - BAR ) domains [ 126 , 127 , 154 ] . In mammals , Toca - 1 is part of the Cdc42 - interacting protein 4 ( CIP4 ) subfamily of PCH / F - BAR proteins , that includes CIP4 [ 131 ] and formin - binding protein 17 ( FBP17 ) [ 135 ] . The CIP4 subfamily proteins share similar domain organization , with N - terminal F - BAR , central Homology Region - 1 ( HR1 ) , and C - terminal SH3 domains . Unlike FBP17 [ 183 ] , the HR1 domains of CIP4 and Toca - 1 bind to active , GTP - loaded Cdc42 [ 81 , 131 ] . Like other F - 78 BAR proteins , Toca - 1 can interact with phosphoinositides via its F - BAR domain and promote tubulation of liposomes in vitro [ 156 ] and membranes in vivo [ 133 ] . The SH3 domain of Toca - 1 can interact with many ligands that regulate actin assembly , including N - WASP [ 81 ] , dynamin [ 133 ] , DRFs [ 157 ] , and Abi1 [ 153 ] . The function of Toca - 1 in mammalian cells is not well defined , but likely involves the coordination of actin assembly adjacent to the plasma membrane and endosomes . Toca - 1 is required for Cdc42 - induced actin assembly via N - WASP - WIP complex in vitro , and this required both Cdc42 and N - WASP binding sites in Toca - 1 [ 81 ] . However , this function of Toca1 in Cdc42 / N - WASP - mediated actin assembly is not likely exclusive to Toca - 1 in mammals , since other PCH proteins that lack Cdc42 binding sites can also promote N - WASP - mediated actin polymerization via SH3 - mediated interactions [ 156 , 209 - 211 ] . Toca - 1 is required for actin comet - based propulsion of Shigella flexneri within the cytoplasm of infected mammalian cells [ 172 ] , a process that requires Cdc42 and N - WASP [ 172 ] . In neuronal cells , Toca - 1 has been implicated in regulating endocytosis and neurite outgrowth [ 83 , 163 ] . Toca - 1 can also modulate trafficking of EGFR from Rab5 endosomes [ 212 ] , and promote anti - bacterial autophagy [ 173 ] . Recent studies have connected Toca - 1 to promoting Rac / WAVE signaling via its interaction with Abi1 [ 101 , 153 ] . In Drosophila , only one CIP4 family protein exists ( dCIP4 ) , and this protein functions in both endocytosis and actin - based vesicle motility induced by Cdc42 / WASP and Abi1 / Rac / WAVE pathways [ 101 , 152 ] . These studies suggest that Toca - 1 may function to coordinate both Cdc42 / WASP - and Rac / WAVE - induced actin branching , which are required for formation and stabilization of lamellipodia and for cell migration [ 207 ] . Despite these implications of Toca - 1 in actin assembly , the functional role of Toca - 1 in mammalian cell migration remains unclear . One recent study demonstrates an inhibitory effect of CIP4 , and to a 79 lesser extent Toca - 1 , on PDGF - induced membrane ruffling and migration of fibroblasts [ 213 ] . This related to the roles of CIP4 and Toca - 1 in downregulating PDGFR signaling by promoting its internalization [ 213 ] . In contrast , we observed no such requirement for CIP4 and Toca - 1 for EGFR internalization , but this does require FBP17 [ 212 ] . Thus , depending on the cell type and mode of receptor internalization , different F - BAR adaptors proteins may function in receptor internalization and trafficking . In this chapter , we show that Toca - 1 co - localizes with F - actin and Arp2 / 3 complex within lamellipodia . We describe the phenotype of shRNA - driven , stable Toca - 1 KD A431 cell lines . Compared to control cells , Toca - 1 KD cells show reduced EGF - induced lamellipodia and impaired EGF - induced wound healing migration . These defects are likely due to reduced Arp2 / 3 complex and Abi1 that are found within lamellipodia of Toca - 1 KD cells , compared to control cells . Combined with evidence that Toca - 1 forms an EGF - induced complex with Abi1 , these results suggest that Toca - 1 plays a role in recruitment and activation of the actin branching machinery within lamellipodia of migrating A431 cells . 3 . 3 Materials & Methods Reagents and materials .

After washing 5 times with PBS / 0 . 2 % Tween - 20 , coverslips were mounted on slides and analyzed by confocal microscopy ( HCX PL APO DIC 63X / 1 . 32 Oil CS objective ; Leica TCS SP2 Multi Photon ; Queen’s Protein Function Discovery facility ) . Surface expression of EGFR was analyzed by flow cytometry , as reported previously [ 212 ] . Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting . A431 cells were serum starved overnight and stimulated with EGF ( 200 ng / ml ) for times indicated in figure legends prior to lysis in Kinase Lysis Buffer ( KLB ) ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 10 µg of aprotinin / ml , 10 µg of leupeptin / ml , 1 mM Na3VO4 , 100 μ M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) .

Triplicate wounds were created for each cell line and photomicrographs obtained just after wounding ( time 0 ) , and again following 24 hours using a phase - contrast microscope equipped with a digital camera . To quantify the cell - free area , cells were plated on gelatin - coated coverslips , serum starved and wounds created as above . At 24 hours of EGF ( 10 ng / ml ) treatment , cells were fixed and permeabilized in 2 % paraformaldehyde / 0 . 2 % Tween - 20 prior staining with TRITC - phalloidin . Photomicrographs for 3 fields of view from triplicate wounds 83 per cell line were obtained by epifluorescence microscopy . The cell free areas were scored ( in pixels , then converted to μ m2 ) and presented as mean ± standard error of the mean ( SEM ) . For live cell imaging , cells were plated on a 35 mm glass bottom dishes ( MatTek , Ashland , MA ) and cultured until a uniform monolayer was formed before generating a wound area as described above . Wound closure was imaged over 16 hours under an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 37 ºC / 5 % CO2 chamber . Movies were made using Fluoview CS3 software ( Olympus ) . Cell scattering assays were performed as previously described [ 215 ] with some modifications . A431 parental cells , vector control , and Toca - 1 shRNA - expressing cell lines were plated at 2 x 10 3 / well in a 6 well plate . Cells were cultured in complete media for 3 days until colonies were formed . Cells were serum starved for 2 days prior to incubation in DMEM containing EGF ( 10ng / ml ) . Several individual colonies were monitored at time 0 and 72 h post EGF treatment using a phase - contrast microscope equipped with a digital camera . Quantification of lamellipodia . A431 vector , shRNA1 and shRNA2 cells were serum starved and treated with or without EGF ( 100 ng / ml ) for 5 min . F - actin staining was performed as described above , and epifluorescence images . Cells with more than 25 % of their plasma membrane showing lamellipodia were scored as positive . Approximately 30 cells were quantified for each cell line and condition , and the results presented as the average from 3 independent experiments . Arc and Abi1 localization to lamellipodia was scored as positive if the ratio of staining intensity within lamella divided by intensity within cytosol was > 0 . 75 . On average , 30 cells were scored for each cell line . Statistical and image analysis . Differences between experimental groups were examined for statistical significance ( P < 0 . 05 ) using paired Student’s T - test in Excel ( Microsoft , Redmond , 84 WA , USA ) . In some figures , intensity profiles are provided for specific regions of interest using Leica Lite software ( Leica ) . 3 . 4 Results 3 . 4 . 1 Toca - 1 co - localizes with F - actin and Arp2 / 3 complex within lamellipodia . Since Toca - 1 is a potential regulator of actin assembly and branching via both the Cdc42 / N - WASP and Abi1 / Rac / WAVE pathways [ 81 , 101 , 153 ] , we examined Toca - 1 localization in A431 cells that undergo EGF - induced changes in membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation [ 215 ] . To determine the subcellular localization of endogenous Toca - 1 , A431 cells were starved and treated with EGF , and stained with Toca - 1 monoclonal antibody . Toca - 1 localized in a punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm in the absence of EGF ( Fig . 3 . 1A ) . EGF treatment led to formation of membrane ruffles and lamellipodia containing F - actin ( Fig . 3 . 1A ) . In EGF treated cells , some Toca - 1 translocated to lamellipodia and was enriched at the membrane protrusions , along with F - actin ( Fig . 3 . 1A , see high magnification view of boxed area ) . We also tested if GFP - Toca - 1 has a similar localization to the endogenous Toca - 1 by transiently transfecting A431 cells with a previously described GFP - Toca - 1 expression plasmid [ 133 ] . To test if Toca - 1 localizes to sites of actin assembly , A431 cells were also stained with Arp2 / 3 complex ( using antibody against p34Arc subunit ) ( Fig . 3 . 1B ) . Consistent with results obtained for endogenous Toca - 1 , GFP - Toca - 1 co - localized with both F - actin and Arp2 / 3 just below areas of membrane protrusion ( Fig . 3 . 1B , see white color in merge panel ) . Some GFP - Toca - 1 puncta within the lamella also co - localized with F - actin and Arp2 / 3 ( Fig . 3 . 1B ) . 85 Figure 3 . 1 . Toca - 1 co - localizes with Arp2 / 3 complex within lamellipodia .

Scale bar depicts 30 μ m . 86 3 . 4 . 2 Toca - 1 regulates EGF - induced lamellipodia formation and motility of A431 cells . To define the potential role of Toca - 1 in regulating actin assembly , we generated stable A431 cell lines transduced with control lentivirus ( vector ) or lentiviruses expressing Toca - 1 - specific shRNAs ( shRNA1 and shRNA2 ) . IB with Toca - 1 antisera revealed no difference in Toca - 1 levels between parental A431 cells and vector cell pools ( data not shown ) . Compared to vector controls , Toca - 1 protein levels were reduced by ≈ 80 % and > 90 % by shRNA1 and shRNA2 expressing cells , respectively ( Fig . 3 . 2A , top panel , compare lanes 1 - 3 ; lower panel , ERK IB served as loading control ) . Next , we tested whether Toca - 1 KD affects EGFR expression levels , and found no diffrerence in surface EGFR levels compared to control cells ( Fig . 3 . 2B ) . In addition , no differences in total EGFR and EGF - induced tyrosine phosphorylated EGFR ( pY - EGFR ) was observed between vector control and Toca - 1 KD cells ( Fig . 3 . 2C ) . As demonstrated previously , A431 cells also express CIP4 and FBP17 [ 134 , 212 ] , but their expression levels were not affected by the Toca - 1 shRNAs ( Fig . 3 . 2C ) Treatment of A431 cells with EGF is known to induce extensive membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation [ 215 , 216 ] . To test whether Toca - 1 regulates lamellipodia , we compared F - actin staining and cell morphology between vector control cells and Toca - 1 KD cells that were serum starved and treated with EGF for 5 min . The vector control cells showed extensive EGF - induced membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation ( Fig . 3 . 3A , top panels ) . In contrast , Toca - 1 KD cells showed many filopodia - like projections in serum starved cells , and less extensive membrane ruffling following EGF treatment ( Fig . 3 . 3A , middle and lower panels ) . To quantify these phenotypes , the percentage of cells that contained lamellipodia in greater than 25 % of their cell periphery was scored for each cell line . While all cell lines showed an EGF - induced increase 87 Figure 3 . 2 . Stable KD of Toca - 1 in A431 cells . ( A ) , A431 cells transduced with vector control or two Toca - 1 shRNA - expressing lentiviruses ( shRNA1 , shRNA2 ) and selected with puromycin . After several passages , cell lysates were prepared and immunoblotted with Toca - 1 antisera and Erk1 / Erk2 antisera to control for loading . ( B ) , Surface EGFR levels were compared between cell lines by staining with PE - conjugated anti - EGFR and isotype control followed by flow cytometry analysis . ( C ) , A431 vector control and Toca - 1 KD ( shRNA2 ) cells were serum starved and treated with or without EGF ( 100 ng / ml ) for 5 or 15 min . Soluble cell lysates were subjected to IB with antibodies to Toca - 1 , CIP4 , FBP17 , EGFR , and active - EGFR ( pY - EGFR ) . Panels for vector and Toca - 1 KD cells are taken from the same autoradiographs of equal exposure time . 88 in lamellipodia , the percentage of Toca - 1 KD cells showing this phenotype were significantly reduced compared to vector control cells ( Fig . 3 . 3B ) . To test whether the observed differences in lamellipodia in Toca - 1 KD cells result in differences in cell motility , we performed wound healing assays . EGF treatment of vector cells led to an almost complete closure of the wound area within 24 hours ( Fig . 3 . 4A ) . In contrast , Toca - 1 KD cells failed to close the wound area as effectively as control cells at 24 hours of EGF treatment ( Fig . 3 . 4A ) . The cell free areas were determined following staining of F - actin , and this showed that both Toca - 1 shRNA - expressing cell pools showed a significant increase ( ≈ 3 fold ) in the cell - free areas following EGF treatment for 24 hours ( Fig . 3 . 4B ) . This effect was also evident by time lapse videomicroscopy of vector and Toca - 1 KD cells ( data not shown ) . When plated at low density , A431 cells form colonies and scatter in response to EGF treatment [ 215 ] . We observed a reduction in EGF - induced scattering of Toca - 1 KD cells , compared to vector control cells ( Fig 3 . 5A ) . These differences do not reflect defects in cell growth , which was comparable between these cell lines ( Fig . 3 . 5B ) . Taken together , these results implicate Toca - 1 is required for EGF - induced migration of A431 cells . 3 . 4 . 3 Toca - 1 promotes actin branching within lamellipodia via recruitment of Abi1 Toca - 1 has been shown to interact with several actin assembly proteins , including Cdc42 / N - WASP [ 81 ] , and Abi1 [ 101 , 153 ] . Abi1 is upstream of both Rac / WAVE and Cdc42 / N - 89 Figure 3 . 3 . Reduced EGF - induced lamellipodia projections in Toca - 1 KD cells .

To gain more insight into the potential cause of the motility and lamellipodia defects we observed in Toca - 1 KD cells , we analyzed the amount of Arp2 / 3 complex within lamellipodia in cells treated with EGF for 5 minutes . As previously shown for parental A431 cells [ 215 , 216 ] , EGF treatment of vector control cells led to formation of prominent lamellipodia containing colocalized F - actin and Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3 . 6A , top panels ; see also the intensity profiles for F - actin and Arp2 / 3 on the right ) . While most Toca - 1 KD cells formed some lamellipodia in response to EGF treatment , these membrane protrusions stained more weakly for F - actin , and contained less Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3 . 6A , middle and lower panels ; see intensity profiles on the right ) . Quantification of the percentage of cells showing intense Arp2 / 3 staining within lamella compared to the cytosol for vector , shRNA1 and shRNA2 cells was performed . Compared to control cells , fewer Toca - 1 KD cells showed strong staining of Arp2 / 3 complex within lamellipodia ( Fig . 3 . 6B ) . To gain more insight into the potential molecular mechanism for Toca - 1 to promote actin branching within lamellipodia , we tested for potential effects of Toca - 1 on Abi1 . Consistent with previous studies [ 219 ] , Abi1 localized to the tips of lamellipodia in EGF - treated A431 vector cells ( Fig . 3 . 7A , top panels ) . In agreement with another recent study [ 214 ] , Abi1 also localized to cell - cell junctions . In Toca - 1 KD cells , we detected less Abi1 localized to lamellipodia compared to vector control cells ( Fig 3 . 7A , middle and lower panels , see intensity profiles on the right ) . Quantification of the relative Abi1 staining within lamella was compared to the intensity within the cytosol for vector , shRNA1 and shRNA2 cells . Interestingly , a significant reduction in Abi1 recruitment to lamellipodia was observed in Toca - 1 KD cells , compared to control ( Fig . 3 . 7B ) . 93 Figure 3 . 6 . Toca - 1 KD results in less Arp2 / 3 within lamellipodia of EGF - treated A431 cells . ( A ) , A431 vector , shRNA1 and shRNA2 cell lines were serum starved , treated with EGF ( 100 ng / ml ) for 5 minutes , and staining of F - actin and endogenous p34 Arc was performed as described in Materials and Methods . Representative confocal microscopy images for F - actin ( green ) , Arc ( red ) and a merged image are shown for control and Toca - 1 KD cells .

( B ) , Graph depicts quantification of the amount of Arc co - localization with F - actin within lamellipodia ( ± SEM ; > 30 cells analyzed / cell line ) as described in Materials and Methods . Asterisks designate a significant difference between Toca - 1 KD and vector control cells based on paired Student T - Test ( p < 0 . 01 ) . 94 These results implicate Toca - 1 in regulating Abi1 localization in A431 cells . To test whether endogenous Toca - 1 and Abi1 interact with one another in A431 cells , and whether EGF treatment could regulate this interaction , we tested for co - immunoprecipitation of Toca - 1 with Abi1 . Indeed , Toca - 1 co - immunoprecipitates with Abi1 , and this was induced further by EGF treatment for 5 minutes ( Fig . 3 . 7C ) . Toca - 1 was not recovered with an unrelated rabbit antisera ( Fig . 3 . 7C , control IgG ) . Taken together , we conclude that during EGF - induced lamellipodia formation , Toca - 1 localizes to lamellipodia , and promotes Abi1 recruitment via binding of Abi1 to the SH3 domain of Toca - 1 . 3 . 5 Discussion EGF signaling promotes the motility of polarized epithelial cells during the wound healing response , and also drives the growth and invasiveness of many epithelial carcinomas [ 4 , 5 ] . Directional cell migration requires filopodia and lamellipodia at the leading edge of motile cells , which is a major site of actin assembly [ 222 ] . In this chapter , we provide novel evidence that the F - BAR protein Toca - 1 co - localizes with Arp2 / 3 and F - actin within lamellipodia , and that Toca - 1 promotes actin branching within lamellipodia and the motility of A431 cells responding to EGF . Further , we show that Toca - 1 interacts with the actin regulatory protein Abi1 , and that Abi1 localization to lamellipodia is reduced by downregulation of Toca - 1 by RNAi . Abi1 functions upstream of both Cdc42 / N - WASP and Rac / WAVE pathways [ 218 ] , and is known to regulate lamellipodia formation and cell motility [ 217 , 219 - 221 ] . Altered subcellular localization of Abi1 in Toca - 1 KD cells may contribute to the defects in EGF - induced lamellipodia and cell motility ( this chapter ) . Thus , we conclude that Toca - 1 functions as a key scaffolding protein to properly coordinate localized actin branching below protruding lamellipodial membranes that is required 95 Figure 3 . 7 . Toca - 1 is required for recruitment of Abi1 to lamellipodia of EGF - treated A431 cells . ( A ) , A431 vector , shRNA1 and shRNA2 cell lines were serum starved , treated with EGF ( 100 ng / ml ) for 5 minutes , and staining of F - actin and endogenous Abi1 was performed as described in Materials and Methods .

( C ) , A431 cells were serum starved and treated with or without EGF ( 100 ng / ml ) for 5 min . Soluble cell lysates ( SCL ) were obtained and subjected to IP with control rabbit antisera ( control IgG ) or rabbit anti - Abi1 , followed by IB with Toca - 1 and Abi1 monoclonal antibodies . The positions of molecular mass markers are shown on the left . 96 for directed cell migration . Although F - BAR proteins are generally linked to promoting or stabilizing inward membrane curvature during endocytosis [ 223 ] , a number of F - BAR proteins , including Toca - 1 , can also promote membrane protrusions , including filopodia and lamellipodia [ 83 , 224 , 225 ] . This has raised the possibility that some F - BAR domains may function more like the related Inverse - BAR ( I - BAR ) domain proteins , such as IRSp53 [ 94 , 226 ] . In neuroblastoma , Toca - 1 was found to promote N - WASP - induced filopodia formation , and this required the F - BAR , HR1 and SH3 domains of Toca - 1 [ 83 ] . However , we observed no apparent defects in filopodia formation in A431 cells depleted of Toca - 1 . These differences may be due to differences in cell type , experimental approach , and endogenous Cdc42 effectors that promote filopodia formation in these systems . F - BAR domains were recently linked to lamellipodia formation , in a study of the F - BAR domain - containing protein - tyrosine kinase FER [ 225 ] . The FX ( F - BAR extension ) domain of FER was shown to bind phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , and confer localization to lamellipodia [ 225 ] . It will be important to define the phospholipid binding preferences of Toca - 1 , and whether the F - BAR domain of Toca - 1 confers localization to lamellipodia . Like our study of Toca - 1 ( this chapter ) , FER KD was shown to result in a defect in cell motility [ 225 ] . These results were consistent with a previous study showing that mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking FER have reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and impaired motility [ 227 ] . Given the roles for F - BAR adaptors like Toca - 1 in recruiting actin nucleation factors to promote actin branching within the lamellipodia , the co - localization of FER may facilitate cortactin phosphorylation , leading to branch point stabilization [ 228 ] . Future studies will be needed to fully understand how different members of the F - BAR protein family may cooperate to regulate the dynamics of membrane protrusions , actin assembly , and cell motility . 97 Although the ability of Toca - 1 and related F - BAR adaptors to regulate actin assembly and membrane curvature have been well characterized in recent years [ 81 , 101 , 133 , 134 , 153 , 154 , 156 ] , the role of Toca - 1 in mammalian cell migration is very poorly studied . Using RNAi approaches , Toca - 1 has been shown to promote actin comet - mediated propulsion of pathogenic bacteria Shigella flexneri [ 172 ] , which occurs via a Cdc42 / N - WASP - dependent mechanism [ 229 , 230 ] . Interestingly , recent studies of the only Toca - 1 - like protein in Drosophila ( dCIP4 ) demonstrated a role for it in actin - based propulsion of Rab5 endosomes [ 101 ] . We and others have demonstrated that a fraction of the cellular pool of Toca - 1 localizes to Rab5 endosomes [ 83 , 212 ] , and may therefore regulate endocytic trafficking of receptors like EGFR [ 212 ] , or other cargo that regulates filopodia formation [ 83 ] . In this chapter , we show that Toca - 1 localizes to lamellipodia and co - localizes with Arp2 / 3 complex and F - actin . It would be interesting to study which domains and interactions mediate this localization of Toca - 1 . We expect that the F - BAR domain of Toca - 1 may facilitate membrane targeting , and the Toca - 1 SH3 domain allows recruitment of Abi1 . This suggests the possible involvement of Toca - 1 in Rac signaling and lamellipodia formation . Another study suggests that CIP4 interacts with WAVE1 and increases WAVE1 phosphorylation by c - Abl [ 231 ] . Our results show less Abi1 in lamellipodia in Toca - 1 KD cells , suggesting that Toca - 1 might be involved in recruiting Abi1 / WAVE complex to lamellipodia to promote Rac activation . It will be important to test this directly in future studies . Our findings that Toca - 1 regulates EGF - induced motility of A431 cells may relate to the mode of migration used by these cells . As described previously for other squamous cell carcinomas [ 232 ] , A431 cells maintain cell - cell contacts during cell migration and invasion [ 233 ] . Since Abi1 has also been shown to localize and regulate cell - cell junctions in A431 cells [ 214 ] . It 98 will be important to characterize whether Toca - 1 regulates junctions . In our EGF - induced scattering assays , Toca - 1 KD cells retained more extensive cell - cell contacts than control cells . Since changes in motility and invasiveness of A431 cells in vitro have also been shown to correlate with increased invasion of A431 cells in vivo [ 234 ] . Future tumor xenografting studies with Toca - 1 KD cells will be important to determine if tumor cell migration and invasion in vivo requires Toca - 1 . It is worth noting that upregulation of Cdc42 and several downstream effectors have been identified in highly invasive breast tumor cells [ 61 ] . It will be interesting to determine whether Toca - 1 is also upregulated in highly invasive tumor cells . In summary , using a stable cell system for RNAi silencing of Toca - 1 expression , we provide evidence that Toca - 1 promotes EGF - induced migration of A431 cells . Loss of Toca - 1 impairs recruitment of Abi1 and amount of Arp2 / 3 within lamellipodia . This may explain the positive role of Toca - 1 in A431 cell migration . 99 Chapter 4 CIP4 Suppresses Src - Induced Invadopodia and Invasion of Breast Tumor Cells 4 . 1 Abstract Like podosomes in macrophages , invadopodia are actin - rich membrane protrusions that promote extracellular matrix degradation and invasiveness of tumor cells . Src protein - tyrosine kinase is a potent inducer of podosomes and invadopodia via phosphorylation of substrates that promote actin assembly . Cdc42 - interacting protein 4 ( CIP4 ) is a Fer / CIP4 homology - Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs protein that was isolated as a potential Src substrate and regulator of podosomes via the recruitment of Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome Protein in macrophages . Here , we show that CIP4 tyrosine phosphorylation is strongly increased in MDA - MB - 231 breast adenocarcinoma cells expressing activated Src ( MDA - SrcYF ) . Like the Src substrate cortactin , CIP4 localizes to Src - induced podosomes and invadopodia . To probe the function of CIP4 in invadopodia , we generated stable , shRNA - driven , CIP4 knock - down ( KD ) MDA - SrcYF cell lines . Compared to control MDA - SrcYF cells , CIP4 KD cells degrade more extracellular matrix , have increased numbers of invadopodia per cell , including mature invadopodia containing matrix metalloprotease MT1 - MMP . While CIP4 KD cells show similar wound healing migration to control cells , they display significantly increased invasion through matrigel . Taken together , our results identify CIP4 as a negative regulator of Src - induced invadopodia and invasion by breast adenocarcinoma cells . 100 4 . 2 Introduction Tumor metastasis requires a subset of tumor cells to acquire the ability to break through the basement membrane and invade through dense networks of interstitial extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins [ 3 ] . The ability of invasive tumor cells to degrade ECM and migrate through tissues is promoted by actin - rich membrane protrusions called invadopodia [ 102 , 105 ] . Invadopodia are finger - like projections of the ventral membrane that are supported by a core of filamentous actin ( F - actin ) , much like podosomes in macrophages [ 106 ] . Podosomes and invadopodia promote ECM degradation via the recruitment of transmembrane type 1 matrix metalloprotease ( MT1 - MMP ) from secretory vesicles , and by localized activation of secreted MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 [ 235 , 236 ] . In addition to promoting invasion via ECM degradation , invadopodia also function in directional cell migration of breast tumor cells towards Epidermal Growth Factor ( EGF ) [ 237 ] . The role of invadopodia in tumor metastasis in vivo is less clear , but increased expression of EGF receptor ( EGFR ) has been shown to correlate with increased spontaneous lung metastases in breast tumor cells [ 238 , 239 ] . Further , upregulation of EGFR and numerous regulators of actin assembly , invadopodia , and cell motility comprise a gene expression signature of invasive breast tumor cells [ 240 ] . However , in experimental metastasis assays , invadopodia were not required for breast tumor metastases to the lung , but did promote tumor progression via enhancing growth of tumor vasculature [ 241 ] . Thus , regulators of invadopodia are potential therapeutic targets for reducing tumor metastasis and cancer morbidity in humans . Formation of invadopodia is regulated by signaling pathways impacting on lipid metabolism , vesicle trafficking , and actin regulatory proteins [ 102 , 120 ] . In breast tumor cells , EGF treatment leads to rapid formation of invadopodia following a burst of actin polymerization from free barbed ends induced by the actin severing protein cofilin [ 113 ] . A regulatory cycle of 101 EGF - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation was shown to control its interaction with cofilin and its F - actin severing activity [ 113 ] . Invadopodia are also induced by expression of activated Src protein - tyrosine kinase ( Src - Y527F ) in breast tumor cells [ 124 ] . Compared to EGF treatment , Src is a more potent inducer of invadopodia and ECM digestion [ 113 ] . Consistent with these findings , Src is a key regulator of breast tumor growth and metastases in mouse models [ 242 , 243 ] . Src is also a potent inducer of podosomes in normal cells , including fibroblasts [ 244 ] , osteoclasts [ 245 ] , and vascular smooth muscle cells [ 246 , 247 ] . Src directly phosphorylates many key regulators of invadopodia precursor formation including cortactin [ 115 ] , and the adaptor protein Tks5 [ 119 , 241 ] . Src - induced podosome precursors form in areas of membrane with elevated PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 levels that recruits the Tks5 adaptor along with N - WASP , that binds the SH3 domains of Tks5 [ 248 ] . Tks5 also recruits Nck adaptor that binds N - WASP to trigger actin assembly [ 249 ] . The finger - like membrane protrusions within podosomes and invadopodia contain inverse - BAR ( I - BAR ) domain proteins IRSp53 and insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate [ 250 ] , that also drive membrane protrusions in filopodia [ 45 ] . These membrane protrusions are stabilized by rapid polymerization of branched and bundled F - actin from barbed ends generated by cofilin [ 113 ] . The Cdc42 / N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 pathway promotes branched actin assembly within invadopodia [ 108 ] . Invadopodia formation also depends on polymerization of unbranched F - actin by DRFs [ 251 ] , and the actin bundling protein fascin that stabilizes invadopodia and promotes invasion of tumor cells [ 250 ] . Invadopodia maturation into ECM degrading structures requires the recruitment of MT1 - MMP from secretory vesicles , and activation of the secreted proteases MMP - 2 / MMP - 9 [ 120 , 124 , 235 , 236 ] . Surface expression of 102 MT1 - MMP within invadopodia is further regulated by endocytosis , controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation of endophilin A2 leading to a block in its ability to bind dynamin [ 123 ] . CIP4 is an adaptor protein that may regulate invadopodia due to its identification as a Src substrate [ 161 , 252 ] , and binding partner of activated Cdc42 [ 131 ] , N - WASP [ 132 ] , dynamin [ 133 ] , and DRFs [ 157 ] . CIP4 is the founding member of the CIP4 subfamily of Fer / CIP4 homology - Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( F - BAR ) adaptor proteins defined by their N - terminal F - BAR domains [ 126 - 128 ] . Two CIP4 - related adaptor proteins Toca - 1 [ 81 ] and FBP17 [ 135 ] share a similar domain organization consisting of F - BAR , Protein Kinase C - related kinase homology region 1 ( HR1 ) , and SH3 domains . F - BAR domains form crescent shaped dimers that bind membrane phospholipids via clusters of basic residues on the concave face [ 136 , 137 , 145 ] . F - BAR proteins participate in clathrin - mediated endocytosis via promoting membrane invagination , actin assembly and vesicle scission [ 223 ] . In addition to plasma membranes , the F - BAR domain of CIP4 also confers localization to Rab5 endosomes [ 212 ] . The HR1 domain of CIP4 binds GTP - loaded Cdc42 [ 131 , 149 ] , while the SH3 domain interacts with numerous ligands involved in actin assembly and endocytosis [ 127 ] . The physiological functions of CIP4 are beginning to emerge , based on RNA interference and gene knock - out studies . CIP4 knock - out mice are viable , but have altered glucose metabolism [ 155 ] . This is consistent with cell - based studies implicating CIP4 in regulating both the trafficking of Glucose - transporter 4 ( Glut4 ) storage vesicles to the plasma membrane [ 159 ] , as well as Glut4 endocytosis via CIP4 interactions with N - WASP and dynamin - 2 [ 164 ] . CIP4 has also been implicated in positioning of the microtubule organizing center ( MTOC ) for directed exocytosis of cytolytic granules in natural killer cells [ 168 ] . CIP4 also functions in endosome to lysosome trafficking of EGFR [ 212 ] . The Drosophila CIP4 orthologue functions in the 103 Cdc42 / WASP pathway controlling E - cadherin endocytosis , and actin - based vesicle motility downstream of both WASP and WAVE [ 101 , 152 ] . Using microinjection of CIP4 fragments into primary macrophages , an early study showed that CIP4 can regulate formation of podosomes [ 167 ] . This paper showed that injection of CIP4 fragments lacking WASP or microtubule binding sites could block podosome formation , possibly by disrupting localization of WASP to podosomes . A recent study showed that FBP17 localizes to podosomes in monocytes and promotes actin assembly and podosome formation [ 169 ] . Taken together , these results point to a potential role for CIP4 and related F - BAR proteins as potential regulators of invadopodia that share many conserved mechanisms with podosomes . In this chapter , we show that CIP4 is a Src substrate in MDA - MB - 231 breast tumor cells . Further , we demonstrate that Src induces localization of CIP4 to invadopodia . Stable , shRNA - driven knock - down ( KD ) of CIP4 in MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing activated Src results in increased numbers of invadopodia and matrix degradation . Consistently , CIP4 KD cells are significantly more invasive through matrigel . These results implicate CIP4 is a suppressor of Src - induced invadopodia formation and invasiveness of human breast tumor cells . 4 . 3 Materials and Methods Antibodies and Reagents .

Immunofluorescence . MDA - SrcYF cells were plated on gelatin - coated glass coverslips for the time indicated in figure legends prior to fixation in 2 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with 0 . 2 % Tween - 20 . Following blocking with 3 % BSA ( Sigma Aldrich ) at room temperature , primary antibodies were added for overnight incubation at 4 ºC as indicated : mouse anti - CIP4 ( BD Bioscience , 1 : 25 ) , rabbit anti - pY421 - cortactin ( 1 : 100 ) , rabbit anti - GFP ( 1 : 200 ) , mouse anti - MT1 - MMP ( 1 : 50 ) . After extensive washing in PBS / 0 . 2 % Tween - 20 , coverslips were incubated with either Alexa Fluor - 488 - conjugated or Alexa Fluor - 633 - conjugated goat anti - mouse or rabbit IgG , ( 1 : 400 ) at room temperature for 1 h . In experiments showing F - actin staining , coverslips were incubated with either TRITC - conjugated or Alexa Fluor - 488 - conjugated phalloidin ( 1 : 200 ) at room temperature for 1 h . After washing , coverslips were 106 mounted on slides and analyzed by either confocal microscopy ( HCX PL APO DIC 63X / 1 . 32 Oil CS objective ; Leica TCS SP2 Multi Photon ; Queen’s Protein Function Discovery facility ) or epifluorescence microscopy ( Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a Q Color5 digital camera ( 60× objective ; images acquired using QCapturePro software ) . Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting . Cells were lysed using Kinase Lysis Buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 10 µg of aprotinin / ml , 10 µg of leupeptin / ml , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 100 μ M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) . Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm , for 10 min at 4 ºC . SCL were subjected to IP with rabbit anti - CIP4 . Antibody – protein complexes were recovered with 20 μ l of Gamma Bind Sepharose beads ( a 50 % [ vol / vol ] slurry in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) and washed 3 times with PBS . Proteins were recovered by adding 25 μ l of 2× SDS sample buffer to the beads . IB was carried out following the transfer of proteins to Immobilon P membranes ( Millipore ) by using a semidry transfer apparatus ( Bio - Rad ) . Blots were probed with antibodies directed against : rabbit CIP4 ( 1 : 1000 ) , ERK1 / ERK2 ( ERK1 / 2 ; 1 : 2000 ) , Src ( 1 : 1000 ) , pY416 - Src ( 1 : 1000 ) , phosphotyrosine ( PY99 ; 1 : 1000 ) Antibody complexes were detected with either horseradish peroxidase - conjugated sheep anti - mouse immunoglobulin ( 1 : 5000 ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) or horseradish peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - rabbit immunoglobulin ( 1 : 10 , 000 ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) and revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ; Applied Biological Materials ) . Extracellular matrix degradation assays , in - gel gelatinase assays , and invadopodia scoring . MDA - SrcYF vector control and CIP4 KD cell lines were trypsinized , counted , and plated on gelatin - coated glass coverslips ( 5 , 000 cells / well ) containing a layer of TRITC - 107 conjugated fibronectin , prepared as previously described [ 254 ] . After incubation for 18 h , cells were fixed and stained for either F - actin and / or pY - cortactin as described above . Confocal microscopy was performed and the areas of ECM degradation underneath of cells stained with F - actin were quantified as digestion area per cell using Image Pro Plus software ( Media Cybernetics ) . At least 30 cells were quantified for each condition and digestion / cell was averaged from 3 independent experiments . Gelatin zymography was performed as described previously [ 255 ] . Briefly , conditioned media from MDA - vec , MDA - SrcYF vector and CIP4 KD cells was collected , clarified by centrifugation , resolved in nonreducing gels containing 0 . 05 % ( w / v ) gelatin , and processed for zones of gelatin degradation by Coomassie blue staining . The number of invadopodia in MDA - SrcYF cell lines were quantified from confocal micrographs as described previously [ 256 ] . Briefly , dot - like structures containing both pY - cortactin and F - actin were scored as invadopodia , and the numbers of invadopodia per cell were quantified . Wound healing assay . Wound healing assays were performed as previously described [ 215 ] . MDA - SrcYF vector and CIP4 KD cells were plated on a gelatin - coated glass coverslips in a 6 well plate at ( 10 6 cells / well ) and cultured for 1 day until a uniform monolayer was formed . Wound areas were made using 200 μ l sterile pipette tips , and washed with serum free media to remove suspended cells . Cells were fixed immediately ( 0 h ) or following incubation for 24 h prior to fixation and staining of F - actin as described above . Wound areas were analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy and the average cell free areas ( 3 fields of views for triplicate samples ) were calculated for each cell line based on pixel areas scored using Corel Photopaint histogram function ( Corel Corp . ) . Invasion assays . Invasion assays were performed as described in Ref . [ 243 ] . Briefly , Transwell inserts ( 8 μ m pore ) were coated with 100 μ l of ice cold Matrigel ( 1 : 5 dilution in 108 DMEM media with 0 . 5 % FBS ) and incubated at 37 o C for 30 min to solidify . MDA - SrcYF vector or CIP4 KD cells were trypsinized , counted and seeded in DMEM serum - free media in the top chamber ( 50 , 000 cells ) which was placed in 24 well plates containing 0 . 5 ml of NIH - 3T3 conditioned media as chemoattractant . After 24 h incubation in the 37 o C incubator , the filters were fixed in methanol , cells and matrigel on top of the filter were removed , and cells attached to the underside of the filter were stained with DAPI . Epifluorescence microscopy was performed to detect DAPI - stained nuclei on the filters ( numbers of invaded cells ) , and quantification was performed using Image Pro Plus software ( Media Cybernetics ) . Statistical analysis . Differences between experimental groups were examined for statistical significance ( P < 0 . 05 or P < 0 . 01 ) using paired Student’s T - test in Excel ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA , USA ) . 4 . 4 Results 4 . 4 . 1 Src phosphorylates CIP4 in MDA - MB - 231 breast tumor cells . Src protein - tyrosine kinase is a key regulator of breast tumor progression , invasion , and metastasis [ 242 , 243 ] . Although CIP4 was identified as a potential Src substrate [ 161 , 252 ] , the potential involvement of CIP4 in Src signaling in breast tumor cells has not been reported . To test this , MDA - MB - 231 cells were transduced with either a control retrovirus ( MDA - vec ) or a retrovirus expressing activated Src - Y527F ( MDA - SrcYF ) . Consistent with previous studies [ 113 , 124 ] , MDA - SrcYF cells form more invadopodia than MDA - vec cells , as marked by F - actin dots over areas of ECM digestion ( Fig . 4 . 1A ) . As expected , MDA - SrcYF cells display elevated levels of Src phosphorylation on the activating Y416 residue , compared to MDA - vec cells ( Fig . 4 . 1B , top panel ) . This is despite only a modest increase in total Src levels ( Fig . 4 . 1B , second panel ) . 109 Next , we tested effects of Src - Y527F expression on tyrosine phosphorylation ( pY ) of CIP4 . Although endogenous CIP4 pY was detected in MDA - vec cell lysates , this was increased dramatically in MDA - SrcYF cell lysates ( Fig . 4 . 1B , third panel ) . This was not due to altered levels of CIP4 expression or recovery between cell lines ( Fig . 4 . 1B , bottom panel ) . These results show that CIP4 pY correlates closely with pY416 - Src levels in MDA - vec and MDA - SrcYF cells . To test further if CIP4 is a Src substrate in MDA - MB - 231 cells , we treated cells MDA - SrcYF cells with Src inhibitors PP2 or SU6656 , or with vehicle control ( DMSO ) . Increased CIP4 pY was observed in DMSO - treated MDA - SrcYF cell lysates , compared to MDA - vec ( Fig . 4 . 2A , compare lanes 1 and 2 ) . However , pretreatment of MDA - SrcYF cells with either Src inhibitor caused a dramatic reduction in CIP4 pY ( Fig . 4 . 2B , compare lane 2 to lanes 3 and 4 ) . This correlated with reduced levels of activated Src detected in the cell lysates with Src inhibitor pretreatment ( Fig . 4 . 2A , bottom panel ) . Densitometry was performed for several experiments , which showed a 3 - fold increase in CIP4 pY in MDA - SrcYF cells , compared to MDA - vec cells , which required Src activity ( Fig . 4 . 2B ) . CIP4 is a likely a direct Src substrate , based on the ability of purified , active Src to phosphorylate recombinant , purified CIP4 in in vitro kinase assays ( data not shown ) . Taken together , our results demonstrate that CIP4 is part of the Src signaling axis in MDA - MB - 231 breast tumor cells . 4 . 4 . 2 Src induces translocation of CIP4 to invadopodia . Src substrates such as Tks5 undergo a dramatic change in subcellular localization in response to expression of activated Src [ 176 ] . To test whether Src also effects CIP4 localization 110 Figure 4 . 1 . Tyrosine phosphorylation of CIP4 is elevated in MDA - MB - 231 breast tumor cells expressing activated Src kinase . ( A ) , MDA - MB - 231 cells were transduced with control retrovirus ( MDA - vec ) or retrovirus expressing Src - Y527F ( MDA - SrcYF ) and plated on gelatin - coated glass coverslips containing a thin layer of TRITC - fibronectin ( ECM ) for 18 hours . Cells were fixed and stained with Alexa Fluor - 488 phalloidin for F - actin . Representative epifluorescence micrographs are shown for F - actin ( green ) and ECM ( red ) or the overlay for both channels ( merge ) . ( B ) , Soluble cell lysates ( SCL ) were prepared from MDA - vec and MDA - SrcYF cells , and subjected to immunoprecipitation ( IP ) with CIP4 antisera and immunoblot ( IB ) with anti - phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody ( anti - pY ) to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of CIP4 . The same blot was stripped prior it IB with CIP4 antisera to test for equal recovery of CIP4 . SCL were also subjected to IB with pY416 - Src and Src antisera . Positions of relative molecular mass markers are indicated on the left . 111 Figure 4 . 2 . CIP4 is a Src substrate in MDA - MB - 231 cells . ( A ) , MDA - vec cells were treated with vehicle ( DMSO ) , and MDA - SrcYF cells were treated with vehicle ( DMSO ) or with Src kinase inhibitors PP2 ( 10 µM ) and SU6656 ( 20 µM ) for 1 hour . SCL were prepared and subjected to IP with CIP4 antisera , and IB with anti - pY to detect levels of CIP4 tyrosine phosphorylation . The same blot was stripped prior to IB with CIP4 antisera to test for equal recovery of CIP4 . SCL were also subjected to IB with pY416 - Src antisera to demonstrate the effectiveness of inhibitor treatments . Positions of relative molecular mass markers are indicated on the left . ( B ) , Relative CIP4 pY was calculated by densitometric analyses of CIP4 pY intensity / total CIP4 intensity for autoradiographs from several experiments . The levels are given relative to CIP4 pY in MDA - vec cells treated with DMSO ( mean ± SD ) . 112 in breast tumor cells , we examined the subcellular localization of endogenous CIP4 by immunofluorescence microscopy . In MDA - vec cells , CIP4 showed a punctate localization throughout the cytosol , with highest levels in the perinuclear region and little co - localization with F - actin ( Fig . 4 . 3A ) . This is consistent with previous studies that found CIP4 localization to the Golgi apparatus and endosomes in epithelial cells and epidermoid carcinoma cells [ 171 , 212 ] . In contrast , CIP4 localized more at the cell periphery in MDA - SrcYF cells in clusters of Src - induced invadopodia marked by F - actin and tyrosine phosphorylated cortactin ( pY - Cort ; Fig . 4 . 3B ) . In addition , CIP4 co - localized with F - actin dots in the perinuclear region ( Fig . 4 . 3B ) , which is another site of Src - induced invadopodia formation in MDA - MB - 231 cells [ 124 ] . To gain more evidence that CIP4 localized to invadopodia , we transfected MDA - SrcYF cells with a CIP4 - green fluorescence protein fusion construct ( GFP - CIP4 ) , and acquired 3D confocal imaging of both GFP - CIP4 and F - actin localization . GFP - CIP4 co - localized with a number of invadopodia in pseudopodia marked by F - actin ( Fig . 4 . 3C ) . Further examination of the F - actin core structures within these invadopodia demonstrated a partial co - localization of GFP - CIP4 with F - actin columns ( Fig . 4 . 3C , right panels ) . It is worth noting that some GFP - CIP4 localized below the F - actin columns of the invadopodia as well ( Fig . 4 . 3C , see X / Z and Y / Z panels ) . Similar results were obtained with 3D confocal imaging of endogenous CIP4 localization in MDA - SrcYF cells ( data not shown ) . To test whether CIP4 also localized to Src - induced podosomes in another cell type , we performed immunofluorescence staining of endogenous CIP4 in NIH - 3T3 fibroblasts expressing Src - Y527F ( 3T3 - SrcYF ) . Consistent with previous studies [ 253 ] , 3T3 - SrcYF cells formed rosettes of Src - induced posodomes marked by F - actin , and CIP4 was localized to these rosettes ( Fig . 4 . 4 ) . This is consistent with previous study implicating CIP4 in regulation of podosomes in 113 Figure 4 . 3 . Src induces translocation of CIP4 to invadopodia . ( A ) , Representative immuno - fluorescence images showing localization of endogenous CIP4 ( green ) , F - actin ( red ) and an overlay of both channels ( merge ) in MDA - vec cells .

( C ) , Representative confocal microscopy image showing localization of GFP - CIP4 ( green ) and F - actin ( red ) in transiently transfected MDA - SrcYF cells . A series of confocal images were taken from dorsal to the ventral surface of the cells and stacked to show the F - actin core within the invadopodia . A high magnification view of the boxed area is shown on the right for x / y , x / z and y / z axis . Scale bar depicts 10 μ m . 114 Figure 4 . 4 . CIP4 localizes to Src - induced podosomes in NIH - 3T3 fibroblasts . NIH - 3T3 cells transduced with a retrovirus expressing Src - Y527F ( 3T3 - SrcYF ) were described previously [ 253 ] . 3T3 - SrcYF cells growing on gelatin - coated glass coverslips were fixed and immunofluorescence staining of endogenous CIP4 and F - actin was visualized by epifluorescence microscopy . Representative images for CIP4 ( green ) and F - actin ( red ) and an overlay ( merge ) are shown . 115 macrophages [ 167 ] , and a recent study for podosome localization of the related adaptor FBP17 [ 169 ] . Taken together , these results provide novel evidence for CIP4 localization to Src - induced podosomes and invadopodia in fibroblasts and breast tumor cells . 4 . 4 . 3 CIP4 is a negative regulator of Src - induced invadopodia formation and matrix degradation . To test the function of CIP4 in breast tumor cells , and the potential for CIP4 to regulate Src - induced invadapodia formation , we generated MDA - SrcYF cells with stable shRNA - driven CIP4 KD . Compared to MDA - SrcYF cells transduced with vector control , CIP4 protein levels were reduced by 80 - 90 % by shRNA1 and shRNA2 , as determined by immunoblot with CIP4 antisera ( Fig . 4 . 5A ; ERK immunoblot served as loading control ) . To test for effects of CIP4 KD on Src - induced invadopodia , MDA - SrcYF - vector control cells and CIP4 KD cells were plated on TRITC - labelled fibronectin ( ECM ) for 18 hours , prior to staining of F - actin and pY - cortactin ( Fig . 4 . 5B ) . Compared to control MDA - SrcYF cells , both CIP4 KD cell pools showed more extensive degradation of ECM and many invadopodia marked by pY - cortactin ( Fig . 4 . 5B ) . Quantification of ECM degradation areas from multiple experiments revealed a ≈ 2 . 5 - fold increase in ECM digestion by CIP4 KD cells , compared to control ( Fig . 4 . 5C , asterisks indicate significant differences from vector control cells , P < 0 . 01 ) . To gain further insight into this phenotype of CIP4 KD cells , we compared the numbers of Src - induced invadopodia ( marked by pY - cortactin over areas of ECM degradation ) , and observed a 2 - fold increase in the average numbers of invadopodia in both CIP4 KD MDA - SrcYF cell lines , compared to control ( Fig . 4 . 5D , asterisks indicate significant differences from vector control cells , P < 0 . 01 ) . These results suggest that CIP4 is a novel , negative regulator of Src - induced invadopodia formation and ECM degradation . 116 Figure 4 . 5 . CIP4 negatively regulates Src - induced invadopodia and ECM degradation in MDA - MB - 231 breast tumor cells . ( A ) , MDA - SrcYF cells were transduced with control lentivirus ( vector ) or lentiviruses expressing shRNA1 or shRNA2 designed to silence human CIP4 mRNA . Following selection with puromycin , cell lysates were subjected to IB with CIP4 antisera to test the extent of CIP4 KD , with ERK IB shown as the loading control . ( B ) , MDA - SrcYF vector control , CIP4 shRNA1 or shRNA2 cells were plated on coverslips coated with fluorescent ECM ( red ) for 18 hours . Cells were fixed and stained for F - actin ( green ) , and pY - Cortactin ( magenta ) prior to imaging by confocal microscopy . Representative images are shown , with boxed areas containing invadopodia shown at higher magnification within insets . ( C ) , Graph depicts the fold increase in ECM degradation area for CIP4 KD cells relative to MDA - SrcYF vector cells ( mean ± sem ; n = 30 cells ; asterisks indicate a significant difference between CIP4 KD and vector control cells based on paired Student T Test , P < 0 . 01 ) . Similar results were observed for 3 separate experiments . ( D ) , Graph shows quantification of the average number of invadopodia ( pY - Cort dots over areas of degradation ) in MDA - SrcYF vector control cells , and CIP4 KD cells ( mean ± sem ; n = 30 cells ; asterisks indicate a significant difference between CIP4 KD and vector control cells based on paired Student T Test , P < 0 . 01 ) . 117 4 . 4 . 4 CIP4 promotes invadopodia maturation and invasiveness of breast tumor cells . MT1 - MMP is required for invadopodia formation , and is a marker of mature invadopodia in breast tumor cells [ 124 ] . To further define how CIP4 regulates invadopodia formation , we tested MT1 - MMP localization relative to the invadopodia markers F - actin and pY - cortactin in MDA - SrcYF control cells and CIP4 KD cells . In CIP4 KD cells , we observed more distinctive MT1 - MMP staining to dots in the perinuclear region than control cells ( Fig . 4 . 6A ) and more MT1 - MMP dots co - localized with F - actin and pY - cortactin in CIP4 KD cells than in MDA - SrcYF control cells ( Fig 4 . 6B ) . To test if CIP4 affects the levels of the major secreted MMP’s induced by Src ( MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 ) [ 124 ] , conditioned media was collected from each cell line ( including MDA - vec controls that lack ectopic expression of Src - Y527F ) . The conditioned media contained increased levels of the activated form of MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 in MDA - SrcYF compared to MDA - vec . No major difference was observed between MDA - SrcYF control and CIP4 KD cells ( Fig . 4 . 6C ) . Thus , CIP4 is not required for Src - induced secretion of MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 . Taken together , these results identify CIP4 as a negative regulator of mature invadopodia marked by accumulation of MT1 - MMP . This may account for the elevated ECM degradation in CIP4 KD cells , compared to control . Since invadopodia promote directional cell motility and invasion of breast tumor cells [ 237 , 257 ] , we compared these properties in both MDA - SrcYF control cells and CIP4 KD cells . Confluent cells were subjected to wound healing assays , and we observed a similar ability of all 3 cell lines to close most of the wound area within 24 hours ( Fig . 4 . 7A ) . Quantification of the cell free areas from multiple wounds revealed no requirement for CIP4 in migration of MDA - SrcYF 118 Figure 4 . 6 . Downregulation of CIP4 leads to more MT1 - MMP localized to invadopodia . ( A ) , MDA - SrcYF vector control and CIP4 shRNA2 KD cells were plated on gelatin - coated coverslips prior to fixation , and staining of MT1 - MMP ( green ) , F - actin ( red ) , and pY - Cortactin ( magenta ) . Representative confocal microscopy images are shown , with boxed areas containing invadopodia shown at higher magnification within insets . Arrows indicate positions of MT1 - MMP ( MMP ) dots within insets for each channel . ( B ) , Graph shows the quantification of the average numbers of MMP dots that co - localized with F - actin , pY - Cort or both , in MDA - SrcYF vector control and CIP4 KD cells ( mean ± sem ; n = 20 cells ; asterisks indicate a significant difference between CIP4 KD and vector control cells based on paired Student T Test , * for P < 0 . 05 , * * for P < 0 . 01 ) . ( C ) , Conditioned media from MDA - vec , MDA - SrcYF vector control , CIP4 shRNA1 , and shRNA2 cells were subjected to an in - gel gelatinase assay as described in Materials and Methods . The inverted image of a representative Coomassie blue - stained gel is shown with positions of activated MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 shown with arrows on the right . The positions of molecular mass markers are shown on the left . 119 cells ( Fig . 4 . 7B ) . Similar results were observed in trans - well migration assays ( data not shown ) . Since CIP4 KD MDA - SrcYF cells degraded more ECM than control cells , we tested whether these differences result in more invasion through a matrigel basement membrane within transwell inserts . Indeed , we observed more DAPI - stained CIP4 KD cells on the transwell filters that had invaded through the matrigel , compared to MDA - SrcYF control cells ( Fig . 4 . 7C ) . Quantification of these experiments revealed a significant increase in the invasiveness of CIP4 KD MDA - SrcYF cells , compared to control cells ( Fig . 4 . 7D , asterisks indicate significant differences from vector control cells , P < 0 . 01 ) . These results identify CIP4 as a novel , negative regulator of breast tumor invasion . 4 . 5 Discussion Invadopodia are finger - like membrane protrusions used by invasive tumor cells to degrade basement membranes and spread to other tissues [ 3 , 102 ] . In this chapter , we identify CIP4 as a regulator of Src - induced invadopodia and invasion by breast tumor cells . CIP4 was previously identified as a potential Src substrate [ 161 , 252 ] , and we confirm that CIP4 is indeed a substrate of Src in MDA - MB - 231 cells , possibly via direct action of Src on CIP4 that we show localizes to invadopodia . Using stable shRNA - driven CIP4 KD approach , we find that CIP4 negatively regulates Src - induced invadopodia formation and ECM degradation in MDA - MB - 231 cells . CIP4 KD cells have increased numbers of mature invadopodia containing MT1 - MMP , which likely contributes to elevated ECM degradation and invasion through matrigel than control cells . While the molecular mechanisms for CIP4 action in breast tumor cells awaits further studies , our results suggest a negative regulatory role for CIP4 on invadopodia formation . 120 Figure 4 . 7 . CIP4 limits MDA - MB - 231 breast tumor cell invasion . ( A ) , MDA - SrcYF vector and CIP4 KD cells were grown to confluence on gelatin - coated glass coverslips prior to creation of wound areas with a sterile pipette tip .

Representative epifluorescence images of F - actin staining of wound areas at time 0 h and 24 h are shown for each cell line .

Graph depicts the average cell free area relative to MDA - SrcYF vector control cells ( mean ± sem ) . ( C ) , MDA - SrcYF vector control and CIP4 KD cells were transferred to transwell inserts ( 8 μ m pore ) coated with matrigel and placed in wells containing NIH - 3T3 conditioned media . After 24 h , cells and matrigel were removed from the upper surface , and cells attached to the underside of the filter ( invaded cells ) were stained with DAPI and visualized by epifluorescence microscopy . Representative fields are shown for DAPI - stainined nuclei of cells that invaded through the matrigel . ( D ) , Graph depicts quantification of the average number of invaded cells per field for each cell line ( 4 fields / insert for triplicate samples ; mean ± sem ; asterisks indicate a significant difference between CIP4 KD and vector control cells based on paired Student T Test , P < 0 . 01 ) . 121 Based on the emerging evidence for CIP4 and related F - BAR proteins in regulating early events of endocytosis [ 133 , 134 ] , or vesicle trafficking of cargo such as EGFR [ 212 ] , it is possible the altered invadopodia function in CIP4 KD cells is due to elevated surface expression of pro - invasive proteins . It is worth noting that a recent study implicates the BAR domain protein endophilin A2 in MT1 - MMP internalization , and a role for Src - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of endophilin to suppress this activity [ 123 ] . Thus , it is conceivable that CIP4 or another F - BAR protein functions in parallel with endophilin A2 to downregulate ECM degradation via internalization of MT1 - MMP . Considering that Src signaling impinges on this process via inhibiting dynamin binding to pY - endophilin A2 , it will be important to test the effects of CIP4 pY on its function in breast tumor cells . Following mapping of the sites of CIP4 tyrosine phosphorylation , future studies on the effects of overexpression of CIP4 wild - type or pY site mutants on ECM degradation by MDA - SrcYF cells could provide more insights into this mechanism . Generation of pY - CIP4 - specific antisera may allow for testing the subcellular localization of pY - CIP4 , and testing the effects of tyrosine phosphorylation on CIP4 interactions with binding partners . It is worth noting that CIP4 has a potential Src pY site ( Y471 ) between HR1 and SH3 domains that was previously noted [ 161 ] . In addition , Y493 within the SH3 domain of CIP4 is well conserved with the sequence surrounding the Y315 phosphorylation site in endophilin A2 ( 489 - CVAIYHFEG - 497 CIP4 , 311 - CKALpYDFEP - 319 endophilin A2 ) . Given the inhibitory effects of pY315 - endophilin on its binding to dynamin and MT1 - MMP internalization [ 123 ] , Src - induced CIP4 pY in breast tumor cells may also alter its affinity for dynamin or other CIP4 binding partners that regulate invadopodia . Interestingly , we recently found that CIP4 localizes to Rab5 endosomes and regulates lysosomal targeting of EGFR in A431 cells [ 212 ] . Internalized MT1 - MMP is also found in Rab5 endosomes prior to either degradation 122 in lysosomes or recycling to the cell surface [ 123 ] . Since the major fraction of internalized MT1 - MMP recycles from endosomes to the cell surface [ 258 - 260 ] , our observations of more MT1 - MMP - positive invadopodia and ECM degradation in CIP4 KD MDA - SrcYF cells could be due to impaired MT1 - MMP internalization or trafficking to lysosomes . MT1 - MMP is also focally delivered to invadopodia by directed exocytosis which involves cortactin , IQGAP1 , and exocyst vesicle - docking complex [ 120 ] . Delivery of key cargo and membranes to podosomes and invadopodia relies on positioning of the MTOC and microtubules [ 102 ] . Since CIP4 regulates MTOC positioning and exocytosis of cytolytic granules in NK cells [ 168 ] , CIP4 may also negatively regulate invadopodia formation via effecting the delivery of vesicles containing invadopodia components . CIP4 and related adaptor proteins have been shown to promote actin assembly via interacting with Cdc42 and / or N - WASP [ 81 , 101 , 156 ] , and these proteins regulate formation of the actin core within invadopodia [ 108 ] . The recent identification of DRFs as key regulators of invadopodia [ 251 ] is also relevant , since FBP17 , CIP4 , and Toca - 1 can all interact with formins via their SH3 domains [ 157 ] . It is likely that CIP4 or related F - BAR adaptors function as positive regulators of actin assembly within invadopodia . Toca - 1 is best characterized as an essential component for actin assembly via Cdc42 / N - WASP in Xenopus lysates [ 81 ] . Toca - 1 was also required to relieve N - WASP autoinhibition in mammalian cells infected with Salmonella flexneri [ 172 ] . In this system , bacterial actin assembly provides for its locomotion through cells via actin comets , which depends on Cdc42 / N - WASP [ 172 ] . It is worth noting that invadopodia are also actin comet - based structures [ 261 ] . N - WASP localizes to the head of the actin comets , while Arp2 / 3 complex , cortactin and fascin localizes to the tails that move in a corkscrew fashion within areas of ECM degradation [ 250 ] . Phosphoinositides may direct N - WASP localization to 123 the head of actin comets via either direct binding with N - WASP [ 262 ] , or possibly indirectly via F - BAR proteins like Toca - 1 or FBP17 . Considering the emerging role for Toca - 1 in N - WASP pathways and actin comets [ 81 , 172 ] , it will be important to test the potential involvement of Toca - 1 as a potential positive effector of actin assembly within invadopodia . One recent study showed that transient KD of FBP17 blocked podosome formation in monocytic THP - 1 cells [ 169 ] . It would be interesting to test the effects of KD of FBP17 and Toca - 1 expression on invadopodia formation and invasiveness of breast tumor cells . Despite their similarities in domain organization and potential binding partners , it is likely that the expansion of the CIP4 subfamily in mammals allows for distinct functions for CIP4 , Toca - 1 and FBP17 in cells that express all three members . The ability of a cancer cell to form invadopodia and digest ECM is directly associated with its ability to invade through 3D matrigel [ 263 ] . In this chapter , we show that CIP4 limits invadopodia formation and invasion of MDA - SrcYF breast tumor cells , without effecting cell migration . It will be important to extend these studies of CIP4 to mammary tumor progression and metastasis models in vivo . The stable CIP4 KD approach used in this chapter should allow for stable silencing of CIP4 expression for during mouse xenograft experiments with MDA - SrcYF cells . Given the ability of Src inhibitors to limit breast tumor metastases [ 243 ] , it will be important to test if CIP4 regulates tumor metastasis . One may also predict that loss of CIP4 expression may be a mechanism for establishing a more invasive breast tumor phenotype . 124 Chapter 5 General Discussion and Conclusions During the course of this thesis project , we and others have provided new insights into how PCH / F - BAR proteins function in normal cell physiology and in cancer cells . A number of key findings have occurred that have moved the study of F - BAR proteins into the forefront of cell biology studies investigating the coupling between membranes and actin assembly . F - BAR adaptors are emerging as key scaffolds that sculpt membranes into curved invaginations via their F - BAR domains , and trigger localized actin assembly that drives membrane fission or vesicle trafficking via their SH3 domains . Despite these advances there are many unanswered questions that remain to be addressed in future . These include issues of potential functional redundancy between PCH / F - BAR subfamily members . In cell lines that express multiple members of the CIP4 subfamily , which members have overlapping functions ? In which subcellular compartments do CIP4 subfamily members interact with binding partners such as Cdc42 , N - WASP , Abi - 1 , dynamin , or formins ? How are these interactions regulated in time and space ? Are these interactions regulated by intramolecular interactions , or post - translational modifications of CIP4 family members ? Dynamic actin assembly and membrane dynamics play key roles in multiple cellular processes , including cell migration and invasion , receptor endocytosis , and vesicle trafficking . In my study , I found CIP4 and Toca - 1 regulated several important cellular functions possibly by coordinating the membrane dynamics and actin cytoskeleton reorganization . CIP4 and Toca - 1 promote EGFR trafficking from early endosomes to lysosomes , thus promote EGFR downregulation and inhibit downstream signalling ( possibly initiating from early endosomes ) , 125 and cell proliferation . CIP4 and Toca - 1 may link early endosome membrane to actin comets and promote actin comet tail - based endosomal motility and endosomal fusion . Endosomal trafficking also contributes to directional delivery of Rac , which is critical for lamellipodia formation . Toca - 1 promotes EGF induced lamellipodia formation and migration by recruiting Abi1 / WAVE / Rac complex and Arp2 / 3 complex to lamellipodia . dCIP4 / Toca - 1 and Abi1 / WAVE interaction is shown to promote vesicle movement propelled by actin comets . Toca - 1 may promote both actin assembly and Rac complex delivery to lamellipodia . MMP internalization , secretion , and exocytosis regulate ECM degradation . As a Src substrate , CIP4 inhibits Src - induced invadopodia formation and ECM degradation by inhibiting MT1 - MMP levels in invadopodia , possibly by promoting MT1 - MMP internalization from invadopodia ( Fig 5 . 1 ) . 5 . 1 The CIP4 family adaptors regulate early and late events in endocytosis CIP4 family proteins have evolved multiple domains for lipid and protein interactions that make them ideal platforms to coordinate changes in membranes and actin cytoskeleton . F - BAR domains bind phosphoinositides , such as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , in the plasma membrane that also recruit endocytic and actin assembly proteins . Targeting of CIP4 to membranes may allow coordinated recruitment and / or activation of SH3 domain ligands such as N - WASP , Abi1 / WAVE , or formins that regulate actin dynamics , which in turn regulates membrane trafficking . In Chapter 2 of my thesis , the relative distributions and functions of the CIP4 family adaptors are clarified during EGFR internalization and trafficking . FBP17 , but not CIP4 and Toca - 1 , was found to localize to CCPs and function in early steps of EGFR internalization by CME . These results were consistent with a previous time lapse imaging study of FBP17 recruitment to CCPs [ 136 ] . Importantly , I demonstrated that CIP4 and Toca - 1 function at later steps in EGFR trafficking from the Rab5 endosomes . 126 Figure 5 . 1 . Emerging roles of CIP4 family proteins in endocytosis , lamellipodia and invadopodia . ( A ) , FBP17 is the only member in CIP4 family protein in CCPs , that promotes early steps in clathrin mediated endocytosis of EGFR ( Chapter 2 ) . F - BAR domain induces membrane invagination , SH3 domain recruits N - WASP and actin assembly that provides force for membrane scission . BAR proteins further constrict the neck of the invaginated membrane and recruit Dynamin leading to membrane scission . ( B ) , CIP4 and Toca - 1 regulate later steps : once internalized EGFR trafficks to early endosomes prior to either recycling or degradation in lysosomes . CIP4 and Toca - 1 localize to early endosomes and promote EGFR trafficking from early endosomes to lysosomes , possibly via promoting actin - based vesicle motility , or tubulation of early endosomes like some PX - BAR proteins . ( C ) , Toca - 1 regulates lamellipodia formation and cell migration : WAVE is inhibited in a protein complex with Abi1 , Nap , Sra , HSPC300 . Rac activates WAVE complex and promotes Arp2 / 3 complex mediated actin branching . Toca - 1 localizes to lamellipodia and recruit Abi1 / WAVE / Rac complex and Arp2 / 3 complex to lamellipodia through binding with Abi1 ( Chapter 3 ) . Toca - 1 may also regulate Rac trafficking by binding with Abi1 / WAVE . ( D ) , CIP4 regulates invadopodia formation and ECM degradation : Cdc42 / N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 promotes actin polymerization and forms the actin core of invadopodia . Cortactin stabilizes branched F - actin . Src phosphorylates multiple regulators of invadopodia , including CIP4 ( Chapter 4 ) . CIP4 negatively regulates invadopodia possibly by inhibiting MT1 - MMP level at invadopodia , possibly through regulation of MT1 - MMP internalization . CIP4 may also regulate the trafficking and directed exocytosis of MT1 - MMP .

Similar results were obtained for Toca - 1 by our lab , the Scita lab , and others [ 83 ] . In the latter study , they demonstrated that Toca - 1 localizes to Rab5 endosomes and regulates filopodia formation in neuroblastoma cells [ 83 ] . However , the mechanisms connecting these processes were not reported . Another later study in 2009 on dCIP4 provided evidence that these proteins can regulate not only early events of membrane scission , but also later steps in vesicle trafficking via both Cdc42 / N - WASP and Abi1 / WAVE pathways [ 101 ] . They also showed that dCIP4 localized in part to the Rab5 compartment . Future studies in all of these cell systems will be required to work out evolutionarily conserved mechanisms by which CIP4 and Toca - 1 function in membrane trafficking . It has been shown that CIP4 family proteins regulate receptor endocytosis by linking F - BAR domain mediated plasma membrane invagination , N - WASP regulated actin polymerization and dynamin mediated membrane fission . EGFR can be internalized via CME and NCE . Some EGFR cargos traffick from early endosome , to late endosomes , then to lysosomes and are degraded there . Others recycle back to plasma membrane . Previous results suggested that downregulation of CIP4 family proteins by triple KD CIP4 , Toca - 1 , and FBP17 or dual KD of CIP4 and FBP17 inhibited transferrin uptake and labelled EGF uptake . However , using individual or combined KD approach for the CIP4 subfamily , our results showed that only FBP17 functions in clathrin mediated EGF uptake . CIP4 and Toca - 1 did not function in this early step of CME . I found that the CIP4 F - BAR domain not only binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , but also has similar affinity for PI ( 3 ) P , which is enriched in early endosomes . My localization study confirmed that CIP4 and Toca - 1 are both localized to early endosomes marked by Rab5 or EEA1 , and this 128 localization is partially mediated by the F - BAR domain . These results suggest they may regulate later events of endocytosis . Indeed , after testing EGFR levels in early endosomes and lysosomes in CIP4 KD cells , I showed that CIP4 could promote targeting of EGFR from early endosomes to lysosomes for degradation . I showed that CIP4 F - BAR domain mutants have a partial defect in localization to early endosomes . It is possible that HR1 or SH3 interactions with Cdc42 and N - WASP may also function in endosomal localization . In the case of Toca - 1 , the SH3 domain was shown to promote the Rab5 localization [ 83 ] . Besides binding to phosphoinositides , another important property of F - BAR domain is to induce membrane tubulation [ 133 , 134 , 136 , 137 , 145 ] . CIP4 and Toca - 1 may promote the budding of early endosome and sorting of EGFR from early endosomes to lysosomes . It might also suggest a role for these membrane shaping proteins in tubulating the early endosome membranes to affect the sorting of cargo and transport vesicles ? The PX - BAR domain - containing sorting nexins have a well described role in forming dynamic tubules within early endosomes for retrograde transport to Golgi [ 202 ] . Perhaps F - BAR proteins generate or stabilize membrane tubules from endosomal membranes , not only the plasma membrane as was first reported . Actin cytoskeleton reorganization plays an important role in CCPs leading to vesicle formation [ 85 , 264 ] . Actin polymerization also generates force to propel the movement of vesicles via actin comets or tails [ 265 - 267 ] . Actin nucleation machinery can be recruited to endosomes and lysosomes to regulate organelle movement [ 268 ] . RhoB binds to autoinhibited murine DRF mDia and activates mDia which initiates or elongates unbranched actin polymerization on the vesicle and generates force to propel movement of vesicles [ 269 ] . RhoD regulates early endosome motility via its effector hDia2C [ 270 ] . CIP4 and Toca - 1 have been reported to interact with formins ( eg . mDia and DAAM1 ) [ 157 ] , N - WASP [ 81 , 133 , 134 ] , and 129 WAVE [ 101 , 153 ] actin assembly pathways . Thus , CIP4 might facilitate membrane trafficking by linking the curved PI ( 3 ) P - rich vesicle membranes to actin tails that drive their motility . It is worth noting that Cdc42 , WASP , and WIP are localized to endomembranes and regulate vesicle motility [ 268 ] . Also , a recent study of dCIP4 clearly demonstrates its role in vesicle motility via localized activation of the WASP and WAVE actin nucleation - promoting factors on endocytic vesicles [ 101 ] . The cell systems we have developed with stable KD of CIP4 and Toca - 1 could be used to test if a similar role occurs in mammals . Live cell imaging following transfection of these cells or control cells with normal CIP4 / Toca - 1 levels with GFP - Rab5 and mCherry - actin would allow for testing whether the numbers of vesicles with actin tails and the vesicle motility is regulated by CIP4 or Toca - 1 . Organelle or vesicle - bound actin assembly can also regulate membrane bilayer fusion . Treating cells with actin disrupting agents has been reported to either promote or inhibit membrane fusion [ 271 , 272 ] . Clearly , more work is needed to sort out the role of actin assembly in this process . It is possible that CIP4 promotes the fusion of early endosome to late endosomes by recruiting actin nucleation factors to vesicles and in turn promoting vesicle - bound actin assembly , which results in more EGFR in lysosomes and less EGFR in early endosomes . 5 . 2 CIP4 Subfamily Adaptors and Cell Migration The coordination between actin cytoskeletal reorganization and membrane trafficking is also critical for cell migration . Migrating cells need to form oriented lamellipodia , which require spatially regulated vesicle delivery of Cdc42 , Rac and actin nucleation factors [ 269 ] . Endocytic trafficking of Rac is shown to be required for the spatial restriction of signaling in cell migration . Rac is activated on endosomes and recycled to the plasma membrane where it can activate the WAVE / Arp2 / 3 actin branching pathway to promote lamellipodia protrusions at the leading edge 130 [ 41 ] . The role of CIP4 and Toca - 1 in actin assembly has been well documented in vitro [ 81 , 156 ] . However , their functional role in cell migration has been poorly studied . In my study , I found Toca - 1 localizes to lamellipodia and promotes lamellipodia formation and cell migration . The EGF induced interaction of Toca - 1 and Abi1 is important for Toca - 1 to regulate lamellilopdia . This study provides novel insights into the role of Toca - 1 in mammalian cell migration . Cdc42 forms complex with N - WASP and WIP and is best known as an inducer of filopodia , but is also required for lamellipodia formation [ 52 ] . It was recently demonstrated that in neuroblastoma cells , Toca - 1 is required for N - WASP - induced filopodia formation [ 83 ] . Other studies have recently linked Toca - 1 to the WAVE pathway via binding to Abi1 [ 101 , 153 ] . Importantly , dCIP4 / Toca - 1 is required to link Abi1 to Cdc42 [ 101 ] , and thus CIP4 or Toca - 1 proteins in mammals may coordinate the localized activation of Cdc42 / N - WASP and Abi1 / WAVE / Rac pathways of actin assembly that are required for lamellipodia formation and cell migration . We developed an A431 cell system with stable Toca - 1 gene silencing that allowed us to investigate the role of Toca - 1 in EGF - induced actin assembly and cell migration . A431 cells were previously shown to form extensive membrane ruffles and lamellipodia in response to EGF treatment . We demonstrated for the first time that Toca - 1 localizes to lamellipodia protrusions marked by F - actin / Arp2 / 3 , and that EGF induces Toca - 1 / Abi1 complex in A431 cells . Most importantly , Toca - 1 depleted cells are less motile than control A431 cells , and this correlated with reduced recruitment of Abi1 and Arp2 / 3 to lamellipodia in these cells . While these findings are consistent with the roles of coordinated actin assembly via Cdc42 and Rac in lamellipodia , it will be important to follow the dynamics of Toca - 1 , Abi1 , Rac , and WAVE during this process . Live cell imaging would allow us to test the hypothesis that Toca - 1 131 through its membrane binding F - BAR domain contributes to its lamellipodia localization and thus the recruitment of Abi1 / WAVE / Arp2 / 3 to lamellipodial protrusions . A structure / function analysis could then identify the most important lipid and protein - protein interactions for this process . It has been shown that binding of F - BAR domains to phosphoinositides like PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 is responsible for plasma membrane localization of CIP4 family proteins . However , F - BAR domains show similar affinity for PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 , and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 [ 133 ] . The recruitment of Toca - 1 to lamellipodia could be induced by localized production of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P2 by locally activated PI3K . It would be interesting to test the Toca - 1 localization to lamellipodia in response to EGF treatment using live cell imaging , which will give more detailed information on how Toca - 1 is recruited to lamellipodia . Whether the F - BAR is required for Toca - 1 localization to lamellipodia can be tested by comparing localization of GFP - Toca - 1 WT and GFP - Toca - 1 5Q ( F - BAR domain mutant that we have generated and proved to reduce the binding of F - BAR to phosphoinositides ) . Another study identified PA as a ligand for localization of FER kinase to lamellipodia via its FX ( F - BAR extension ) domain . Phospholipase D production of PA was required for FER localization to lamellipodia [ 225 ] . In future , testing whether Toca - 1 localization to lamellipodia is disrupted by inhibitors of either phosphoinositides or PA production may help address this . Regulation of lamellipodia formation by Toca - 1 is likely mediated by coordinating the activation of Cdc42 / N - WASP and / or Abi1 / Rac / WAVE pathways of actin assembly . Abi - 1 has been shown to be a positive regulator breast cancer cell proliferation , migration , and invasion . Down - regulation of Abi - 1 blocked cell adhesion , actin polymerization , and lamellipodia formation , thus decreased invasiveness and migration of MDA - MB - 231 cells [ 220 ] . Abi1 not only regulates WAVE activation , but can also regulates N - WASP in distinct actin - based cellular functions [ 218 ] . Abi1 and WAVE are critical for Rac dependent membrane 132 protrusions and macropinocytosis , while Abi1 regulates N - WASP during actin based vesicle transport [ 218 ] . Thus , controlling the subcellular distribution of Abi1 can have profound effects on many cell processes . Toca - 1 may play a role in determining the subcellular distribution of Abi1 for the cells to acquire a motile phenotype . Thus , it will be important to test whether Toca - 1 regulates the distribution and activation of Rac and WAVE within lamellipodia . Indeed , preliminary results suggested that Toca - 1 KD significantly reduced the recruitment of Rac to the lamellipodia ( data not shown ) . Thus , Toca - 1 may act as a scaffold with F - BAR domain binding to plasma membrane in lamellipodia and SH3 domain recruiting Abi1 / WAVE / Rac complex . In future studies , it would be important to confirm the indirect binding of Toca - 1 with WAVE , and if KD of Abi1 or WAVE results in the same effect as KD of Toca - 1 . Also , since Toca - 1 depletion did not completely block EGF - induced migration or lamellipodia formation , it is likely that other family members may partially compensate for Toca - 1 . We know that expression levels of CIP4 or FBP17 did not change in Toca - 1 KD cells . In future , we should extend these studies to dual and triple KD to test if defects become more severe . Based on the previous study by Bu et al . that linked Toca - 1 to filopodia formation , we initially focussed more on the potential effect of Toca - 1 KD in A431 cell filopodia . Surprisingly , we saw the opposite effect of Toca - 1 KD in these cells , with long filopodia marked by Fascin , that were very striking under regular growth conditions or serum starvation ( data not shown ) . Future studies will be required to better understand the role of Toca - 1 as a positive or negative regulator of filopodia . Since our studies were mostly conducted on fixed cells , we can not conclusively define these structures as dynamic filopodial protrustions that have lifetimes in the 2 - 3 minute range . These long protrusions could reflect a more prominent cell contraction response in Toca - 1 depleted cells , leaving behind long retraction fibers . Future studies using time 133 lapse imaging should allow for these long protrusions to be better characterized . I also found that Toca - 1 localization to these filopodia - like protrusions was increased significantly with an SH3 domain - inactivating mutation ( data not shown ) . This would suggest that a ligand of the Toca - 1 SH3 domain is actively transporting Toca - 1 away from the tip of these protrusions . Since actin - binding formins are also moving in a retrograde fashion in filopodia , and are potential SH3 binding partners of Toca - 1 , this would be a reasonable hypothesis to test in future . Toca - 1 may also regulate lamellipodia formation and cell migration by regulating trafficking via promoting actin comet - based vesicle motility via either Abi1 / WAVE and / or Cdc42 / N - WASP , as shown recently in Drosophila [ 101 ] . Toca - 1 KD might result in a defect in spatial delivery of Rac signaling complex and other actin nucleation factors to the leading edge of motile cells . Less Abi1 or Rac recruitment to the leading edge of cells may explain the observed defects in Arp2 / 3 recruitment and actin branching necessary to support membrane protrusions . Increased collapse of membrane protrusions in Toca - 1 depleted cells might also relate to the long filopodia - like protrusions , which may actually be retraction fibers . Altered dynamics of lamellipodia protrusion and actin assembly may account for the defects observed in cell migration in Toca - 1 deficient cells . It would be interesting in future to closely track endocytic trafficking of Rac in control and Toca - 1 KD cells . 5 . 3 Role of CIP4 in invadopodia formation and cell invasion Invadopodia formation and cell invasion through the ECM is a process that requires coordination of actin polymerization , membrane invagination , membrane protrusion [ 103 ] , endocytosis [ 123 ] , vesicle trafficking , and exocytosis [ 114 , 273 ] . Thus , coordination of membrane dynamics and actin cytoskeleton is important for this process . Src is a critical kinase that promotes the formation of invadopdia and cell invasion by phosphorylating several critical 134 players such as cortactin and Tks5 . An CIP4 isoform CIP4b was identified as a potential Src substrate in other cell types [ 161 ] , and CIP4 interacts with multiple important regulators of invadopodia ( eg . Cdc42 , N - WASP , dynamin , formins ) [ 131 , 133 , 134 , 157 ] . However , the role of CIP4 in invadopodia in cancer cells has never been reported . My study showed for the first time that CIP4 localizes to invadopodia and regulates invadopodia formation and cell invasion . Similar to other invadopodia regulators , CIP4 is also a Src substrate in breast cancer MDA - MB - 231 cells . Src induces CIP4 translocation to invadopodia . After generating stable CIP4 KD cells , we found CIP4 negatively regulates invadopodia formation , ECM degradation , and cell invasion . But CIP4 did not affect cell migration . Higher MT1 - MMP level was detected at the invadopodia in CIP4 KD cells , suggesting CIP4 inhibits ECM degradation possibly by inhibiting MT1 - MMP level at invadopodia . MT1 - MMP is an important and well studied transmembrane type MMPs in invadopodia . CIP4 possibly regulates MT1 - MMPs level at several steps of endocytosis , MT1 - MMP internalization , trafficking , recycling , exocytosis , and degradation . CIP4 plays a fundamental role in membrane internalization . A recent study showed that endophilin A2 promotes MT1 - MMP internalization . Interestingly , endophilin A2 is phosphorylated by Src on Y315 ( within SH3 domain ) , and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction between endophilin and dynamin . Overexpression of an Y315F mutant of endophilin A2 led to increased MT1 - MMP internalization [ 123 ] . This is consistent with my observation that EGF - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CIP4 correlated with reduced association with dynamin in A431 cells ( unpublished data ) . Recently , our lab has identified that tyrosine 471 is the major Src - induced phosphorylation site in CIP4 , and are currently attempting to test the effects of CIP4 WT and Y471F mutants on MT1 - MMP internalization and ECM degradation . CIP4 may also inhibit ECM degradation by 135 promoting the trafficking of internalized MT1 - MMP from early endosomes to lysosomes for degradation as it does for EGFR shown in chapter 2 , or regulate direct exocytosis of MT1 - MMP to invadopodia as CIP4 regulates MTOC orientation and cytotoxic secretion in NK cells . The secretion of MMP2 and MMP9 were also tested and proved to be no difference in CIP4 KD cells . In future , it would be important to test MT1 - MMP internalization and trafficking in CIP4 KD cells . Different CIP4 family proteins can play negative roles as well as positive roles in invadopodia formation . Besides inhibiting MT1 - MMP levels at invadopodia , CIP4 family proteins may also promote invadopodia formation by assisting with actin core formation as they are well know to promote N - WASP activation . A recent report showing that FBP17 promotes podosome formation in monocytic cells is consistent with this prediction . This finding together with my finding suggests that three CIP4 family members might have distinct functions in invadopodia formation . It is possible CIP4 family proteins have different functions in different cell types or distinct functions in one cell type to regulate invadopodia more exquisitely . Based on the importance of Cdc42 / N - WASP in actin core formation , it will be particularly interesting to test the role of Toca - 1 in invadopodia formation . While there remain many questions to be solved about the unique and redundant functions of CIP4 family adaptor proteins , the development of knock - out and RNAi systems to investigate their functions , will certainly provide important insights into the physiological functions of CIP4 F - BAR proteins in regulating metabolism , immunity , and pathological conditions . 136 References 1 .
