A major hurdle to the elucidation of SLE pathogenesis is our limited 53 understanding of dysregulated gene expression linked to various clinical statuses with a high cellular 54 resolution . Here , we conducted a large - scale transcriptome study with 6 , 386 RNA sequencing data 55 covering 27 immune cell types from 159 SLE and 89 healthy donors . We first profiled two distinct cell - 56 type - specific transcriptomic signatures : disease - state and disease - activity signatures , reflecting 57 disease establishment and exacerbation , respectively . We next identified candidate biological 58 processes unique to each signature . This study suggested the clinical value of disease - activity 59 signatures , which were associated with organ involvement and responses to therapeutic agents such 60 as belimumab . However , disease - activity signatures were less enriched around SLE risk variants 61 than disease - state signatures , suggesting that the genetic studies to date may not well capture 62 clinically vital biology in SLE . Together , we identified comprehensive gene signatures of SLE , which 63 will provide essential foundations for future genomic , genetic , and clinical studies . 64 65 All rights reserved .

SLE has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations such as skin 68 rashes , arthritis and nephritis , and the disease course is generally unpredictable 3 . This 69 heterogeneous nature has hampered a better understanding of SLE pathogenesis and the 70 development of effective therapeutic agents 4 , 5 . To date , only two biologics have been approved for 71 SLE , belimumab ( BLM ) and anifrolumab , monoclonal antibodies against B cell - activating factor 72 ( BAFF ) and type I interferon ( IFN ) receptor subunit 1 , respectively 6 – 9 . 73 To detect biomarkers and therapeutic targets for SLE , several studies on bulk whole - blood or 74 peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) transcriptomes have revealed some key gene signatures 75 related to IFN signaling , granulocytes , and plasma cells 10 – 16 . However , these studies have suffered 76 from one critical limitation : the results were biased by the abundance of various immune cell 77 populations in the analyzed samples , which complicates the identification of any cell - type - specific 78 disease - relevant signatures 17 . Therefore , recent studies applied single - cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA - 79 seq ) , a powerful technology to improve cellular resolution , to PBMCs , skin and kidney samples from 80 SLE patients and have successfully identified several cell subpopulations crucial for lupus 81 pathogenesis 18 – 20 . However , since these scRNA - seq studies of SLE were limited by sparse 82 expression information and small sample sizes ( around 30 cases ) , they were not well - powered to 83 capture comprehensive transcriptome abnormality related to different clinical manifestations .

Researchers have 87 conducted large - scale genome - wide association studies ( GWASs ) for SLE 21 – 23 , identifying more than 88 one hundred risk loci . Combined with omics data mostly from healthy individuals , researchers 89 attempted to interpret the genetic etiology and have identified potential causal roles of IFN , Toll - like 90 receptor signaling and immune complexes 24 – 26 . However , these studies have not thoroughly 91 investigated the complex interactions between risk variants and the transcriptome dysregulation seen 92 in SLE patients . Such investigations hold the promise to elucidate the complex pathogenesis of SLE . 93 To address these issues , we conducted a large - scale transcriptome study of 6 , 386 bulk RNA 94 sequencing ( RNA - seq ) data including 27 purified immune cell types in peripheral blood that 95 encompassed almost every type of immune cell ( Fig . 1 ) . We recruited 136 SLE patients with various 96 disease activities and clinical presentations ( 22 among them were re - evaluated after BLM treatment ; 97 Methods ) and 89 healthy volunteers in the Immune Cell Gene Expression Atlas from the University 98 of Tokyo ( ImmuNexUT ) cohort 27 ( discovery dataset ) . Using multiple approaches , we investigated cell - 99 type - specific transcriptome dysregulation and classified them into two categories : disease - state and 100 disease - activity signatures . Furthermore , we deployed these signatures to five main topics of 101 downstream analyses : i ) replication , ii ) biological interpretation , iii ) diverse organ involvement , iv ) pre - 102 and post - treatment comparison , and v ) the SLE - GWAS signals ( Fig . 1 ) .

We recruited 248 111 donors in total . Among them , 136 unique SLE patients and 89 healthy controls ( HC ) were included in 112 the discovery dataset ; the rest included 22 post - BLM patients ( Methods ) . Compared with previous 113 studies with fine resolution transcriptomes 18 – 20 , larger sample size with multiple clinical statuses ( e . g . , 114 disease activity , organ involvement , and treatment profiles ) is an advantage of our cohort 115 ( Supplementary Note ; Supplementary Table 2 ) . At enrollment , 30 patients ( 22 . 1 % ) in the discovery 116 dataset had high disease activity ( HDA ; SLEDAI - 2K 28 ≥ 9 ) , while 31 ( 22 . 8 % ) patients were inactive 117 ( SLEDAI - 2K = 0 ) . Forty one ( 30 . 1 % ) , 27 ( 19 . 9 % ) and 30 ( 22 . 1 % ) patients had mucocutaneous , 118 musculoskeletal , and renal activity , respectively 29 . 119 To understand the highly complex transcriptomic signatures in our datasets ( 16 , 000 genes 120 and 6 , 386 samples from 248 donors ; Extended Data Fig . 1a ; Methods ) , we first aimed to project all 121 samples in low dimensional spaces . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) showed that the samples 122 from the same cell type clustered together followed by the same cell lineage ( Extended Data Fig . 123 1b ) ; this pattern became more evident in the uniform manifold approximation and projection ( UMAP ) 124 ( Extended Data Fig . 1c ) . We also confirmed that batch effects were successfully removed in all cell 125 types ( Extended Data Fig . 2a - b ) . 126 All rights reserved .

To explicitly quantify 127 transcriptome patterns well - established for lupus , we utilized 100 IRGs reported in a recent PBMC 128 scRNA - seq study having the highest cellular resolution 20 ( Fig . 2a ) . The cell - type - and disease - 129 specific IRG expression patterns were globally consistent with those in the original publication : e . g . , 130 upregulated CXCL10 and IFITM3 expression ( G5 ) in lupus CD16 - positive monocytes ( CD16p Mono ) 131 and upregulated IRF7 and PARP10 expression ( G8 ) in plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDC ) . 132 Additionally , about half ( n = 54 ) of IRGs showed the highest expression in SLE neutrophil - lineage 133 cells , which were not evaluated in the previous scRNA - seq studies of SLE 18 – 20 . Together , our 134 transcriptomic data exhibited the expected cell - type - specific patterns and recapitulated previously 135 established IRG signatures . 136 137 Disease activity is a major source of variation in the within - SLE transcriptome data . 138 To explore the source of the transcriptomic variations in the discovery dataset , we conducted PCA 139 within each cell type and evaluated the distribution of samples in the PCA space ( Supplementary 140 Data 1 ) . The top PCs differentiated SLE patients from HC in all cell types , indicating widespread 141 transcriptome perturbations in SLE immune cells ( Fig . 2b ; Extended Data Fig . 3 ) . In addition , gene 142 expression profiles within patients showed higher variation than those within HC ( Fig . 2c ; Methods ) . 143 We further evaluated how the transcriptome variations reflected the heterogeneous clinical 144 statuses . We first confirmed that PC1 - 7 is the minimum set to associate the transcriptome with the 145 clinical parameters in the discovery dataset and utilized PC1 - 7 scores for subsequent analyses 146 All rights reserved .

We then quantified the 147 contribution of clinical parameters to the within - SLE variation using weighted variance partitioning 148 analysis ( Fig . 2d ; Methods ) . Importantly , this analysis revealed that disease activity had the largest 149 contribution to the total variation within SLE in almost all cell types ( 7 . 6 % on average ) , around 2 . 9 - 150 fold larger than the treatment contribution . 151 152 SLE disease - state and activity signatures . 153 Motivated by the fact that both case - control differences and disease activity substantially contributed 154 to the whole transcriptome architecture , we next deployed a supervised approach to the discovery 155 dataset to identify two transcriptomic signatures for each cell type : i ) disease - state signature genes , 156 defined as differentially expressed genes ( DEGs , false discovery rate [ FDR ] < 0 . 05 ) between inactive 157 SLE and HC , which reflect the biology of disease establishment , and ii ) disease - activity signature 158 genes , defined as DEGs between HDA and inactive SLE , which reflect the biology of disease 159 exacerbation ( Fig . 1 , middle ; Fig . 3a ; Extended Data Fig . 4a ) . We detected comparable numbers of 160 DEGs between these two comparisons ( on average , 2 , 098 disease - state and 2 , 114 disease - activity 161 signature genes ; Extended Data Fig . 4b ; Supplementary Data 2 - 3 ) . We conducted replication 162 analysis using independent cohorts 33 – 35 ( Fig . 1 , i ) and confirmed the robustness of both signatures by 163 showing their high replicability ( one - sided sign test , Bonferroni - corrected P < 0 . 05 ; Supplementary 164 Note ; Supplementary Table 4 ; Extended Data Fig . 5a - b ) . 165 All rights reserved .

Based on the proportion of DEGs and Jaccard index , we found 169 three different transcriptome perturbation patterns ( Methods ) : disease - state dominant pattern , e . g . , 170 B - lineage cells and naive CD4 / 8 + T cells , disease - activity dominant pattern , e . g . , plasmablasts , and 171 shared pattern , e . g . , monocyte - and neutrophil - lineage cells ( Fig . 3a - b ; Extended Data Fig . 4b ) . 172 When we evaluated the similarity based on the correlation of log fold changes ( logFC ) for both 173 signatures , we observed consistent patterns ( Extended Data Fig . 4c ) . 174 We next compared signature genes across different cell types and confirmed cell - type - 175 specific and shared components . Around 20 % and 30 % of signature genes were detected in only one 176 cell type and lineage , respectively ( Fig . 3c ) . To understand the distribution of the shared components 177 across cell types , we calculated the Jaccard index ( Fig . 3d ) and correlation ( Extended Data Fig . 4d ) . 178 Globally , we detected higher similarity within the same cell - lineage than in different lineages in both 179 signatures . However , we found a clear discrepancy between the signatures ; high similarity among T 180 helper 1 ( Th1 ) and cytotoxic lymphocytes ( natural killer [ NK ] and CD8 + memory T - lineage cells ) 36 181 was observed only in activity signatures ( blue square in Fig . 3d and Extended Data Fig . 4d ) . These 182 gaps indicated the presence of gene expression patterns specific to HDA patients in these cell types . 183 Thus , our dataset captured distinct transcriptome perturbations in the disease establishment and 184 exacerbation phases in a cell - type - specific manner . 185 All rights reserved .

Fifty - one 192 genes were upregulated in at least one signature , consistent with previous studies : IFNG in Th1 , NK , 193 and CD8 + memory T - lineage cells 38 , 39 , and TNFSF13B , encoding BAFF , especially in DC - , 194 monocyte - , and neutrophil - lineage cells with the highest expression 40 ( Fig . 4a , top ) . Among these 195 genes , we identified 21 and 17 that were upregulated specifically in one cell - lineage in disease - state 196 and activity signatures , respectively ; representative examples of activity signatures included IL12A / B 197 in switched memory B cells ( SM B ) , IL1B in monocyte - lineage , CCL2 / 8 in classical monocyte ( CL 198 mono ) , IL18 / TNFSF15 in neutrophil - lineage cells , and IL21 and CXCL13 in Th1 ( Fig . 4a , top ) . 199 Among them , IL21 and CXCL13 , critical genes to support B cell antibody production 41 , 42 , are 200 especially intriguing . Although previous studies reported follicular helper T cells ( Tfh ) as the major 201 source of IL21 and CXCL13 43 , Th1 showed a more dynamic increase than Tfh , especially in the 202 activity signatures ( Fig . 4a , bottom ) . 203 Next , we inferred activities of transcription factors ( TF ) , essential regulators of immune 204 function , based on the expression of TF - downstream genes ( Methods ) . Among 61 , 182 total tests 205 All rights reserved .

Among 207 them , disease - activity signatures showed more enrichments ( 862 enrichments [ 70 . 2 % ] ; Fig . 4b , top ) . 208 These results suggested underappreciated pathogenic roles of TFs in SLE exacerbation . We here 209 highlight two such examples ( Fig . 4b , middle ) . First , cell cycle regulators including E2F - families 210 showed strong enrichment in activity signatures of Th1 , NK , CD8 + memory T - lineage cells , and 211 plasmablasts , indicating that these cells are probably proliferating in active SLE patients . Upregulated 212 cell cycle regulation might be driving the high similarities between these cell types in disease - activity 213 signatures ( Fig . 3d , right ) . Second , BACH2 showed significant enrichment in disease - activity 214 signatures for myeloid - lineage cells . Intriguingly , BACH2 also showed strong enrichment in 215 lymphocytes , consistent with previous studies 44 , 45 , but primarily in disease - state signatures . These 216 results demonstrated that an identical gene regulatory machinery can exert a pathogenic effect in 217 different cell types depending on the disease phases ( Fig . 4b , bottom ) . 218 Lastly , we also performed pathway enrichment analyses to examine multiple biological 219 processes underlying lupus pathogenesis ( Methods ) . Among 32 , 292 total tests for 598 pathways , we 220 observed 735 and 315 significant enrichments for disease - state and activity , respectively ( FDR < 221 0 . 05 ; one - sided Fisher’s exact test ; Extended Data Fig . 6a ; Supplementary Table 7 - 8 ) . We 222 confirmed the enrichment of established pathways such as complement activation 46 , 47 223 ( Supplementary Note ; Extended Data Fig . 6b ) . Intriguingly , we found different enrichment patterns 224 between the signatures in metabolism - and cellular process - related KEGG pathways ( Fig . 4c , left ; 225 All rights reserved .

For example , oxidative phosphorylation signaling was enriched 226 especially in B - lineage cells for disease - state whereas it was enriched in Th1 and effector memory 227 CD8 + T cells ( EMCD8 ) for disease - activity signatures ( Fig . 4c , right ) . TCA cycle signaling was 228 enriched in disease - activity signatures of Th1 and CD8 + memory T - lineage cells . Ribosome 229 pathways were enriched only in disease - activity signatures . Cell cycle activation was enriched 230 predominantly in disease - activity signatures of Th1 , NK , CD8 + memory T - lineage cells , and 231 plasmablasts . Although ribosome and cell cycle pathways were already described as disease activity - 232 related pathways in previous bulk whole - blood studies 13 , 16 , our analysis clarified the precise cell - type 233 origin of these pathways . Furthermore , we extended our view to previously underappreciated 234 pathways such as immunometabolism , describing disease establishment and exacerbation phases 235 separately . 236 237 Cell - type - specific contribution to organ involvement in SLE . 238 To resolve the complex relationships between transcriptome dysregulation and clinical heterogeneity 239 in SLE , we leveraged a PC - based unsupervised approach ( Fig . 1 , iii ) . In the hierarchical clustering of 240 225 unique individuals using all 189 PCs ( = 7 PCs × 27 cell types ) , HC were clearly separated from 241 patients ; in addition , HDA patients with multiple organ complications were clustered together ( Fig . 5a ; 242 Extended Data Fig . 7a ) . 243 Compared with the approach using thousands of signature genes , the PC - based approach is 244 better at representing whole transcriptome architecture with a small number of parameters .

Among 189 PCs , we identified 37 disease - state PCs and 25 disease - activity PCs ; among 249 them , nine PCs were classified into both ( Extended Data Fig . 7b ) . When we projected the data from 250 independent cohorts onto our PCA space , PC scores maintained the original contrasts , confirming 251 the good replicability of both PC signatures ( one - sided sign test , P < 0 . 05 ; Supplementary Note ; 252 Extended Data Fig . 5c ; Supplementary Table 9 ) . This PC - based approach successfully captured 253 the continuous nature of SLE biology ; most disease - activity PCs showed a gradual increase in the 254 association signals along with the extent of disease activity ( Fig . 5b ; Extended Data Fig . 7b ) . 255 To overview cell - type - specific contributions to organ involvement , we first assessed the 256 variance proportion of cell - type - specific PCs explained by clinical parameters ( weighted variance 257 partitioning analysis ; Methods ) . Overall disease activity , a composite measure reflecting the status of 258 all organs , significantly contributed to the within - SLE transcriptome variation especially in the 13 cell 259 types including Th1 , plasmablasts , and monocyte - and neutrophil - lineage cells ( Bonferroni - corrected 260 jackknife resampling P [ P jk ] < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 2d ; Fig . 5c , left ; Methods ) . We then decomposed the overall 261 activity into seven organ / domain categories 28 , 29 : constitutional , mucocutaneous , musculoskeletal , 262 renal , extrarenal severe , hematological , and serological activities ( Fig 5c , right ; Extended Data Fig . 263 8 ; Supplementary Table 10 ; Methods ) . Interestingly , each organ / domain showed distinct cell - type - 264 specific patterns . While Th1 showed the highest explained variance for mucocutaneous activity , the 265 All rights reserved .

Furthermore , 266 neutrophil - lineage cells exhibited the largest contribution to renal involvement , followed by monocyte - 267 lineage cells , Th1 , and plasmablasts . 268 We next evaluated the specific relationship of each disease - activity PC with organ 269 involvement ( Fig 5d ; Supplementary Note ; Supplementary Table 3 ) . For renal activity , neutrophil 270 ( Neu ) PC1 and non - classical monocyte ( NC Mono ) PC2 showed strong associations ( linear 271 regression test ; FDR < 0 . 05 ) . We also identified significant associations of Naive CD4 PC7 and 272 double negative ( DN ) B cell PC5 with musculoskeletal activity ; these associations might be 273 underestimated by the weighted variance partitioning analysis , which prioritizes the contribution of top 274 PCs ( Methods ) . Together , our results confirmed the critical roles of granulocytes and macrophages 275 for the development of lupus nephritis ( LN ) 48 , 49 . In addition , our results also suggested other potential 276 cell - type - specific contributions to organ involvement , which may be informative in unravelling SLE 277 clinical heterogeneity . 278 279 Cell - type - specific activity signatures linked to treatment responses . 280 Belimumab ( BLM ) is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits BAFF , a vital factor for B cell survival and 281 differentiation 6 , 7 , 40 . We investigated the effect of BLM on the transcriptome in each cell type ( Fig . 1 , 282 iv ) . Our cohort has longitudinal data before and six months after BLM induction on 22 individuals ; we 283 refer to them as pre - and post - BLM . Importantly , none of the post - BLM samples were included in the 284 discovery dataset ; therefore , the comparison between pre - and post - BLM is independent of the 285 All rights reserved .

We observed DEGs between pre - and 286 post - BLM ( BLM - DEGs ) predominantly in B - lineage cells , confirming the cell - type - specific effects of 287 BLM ( Fig . 6a ) . When we categorized the patients into good and poor responders to BLM ( n = 9 and 288 13 , respectively ; Methods ) , more DEGs were observed in good than in poor responders ( Fig . 6b ; 289 Supplementary Data 4 ) . The IFNγ - related , nuclear factor - kappa B ( NFκB ) - related , and glycolysis - 290 related pathways were enriched in B cell DEGs of good responders ( FDR < 0 . 05 , one - sided Fisher’s 291 exact test ; Fig . 6c ; Supplementary Table 11 ) , consistent with the downstream signaling of BAFF - 292 receptors in B cells 50 , 51 . 293 We next asked whether BLM effects on transcriptomes counteract disease - activity 294 signatures . We first calculated the Jaccard similarity index to quantify the shared genes between 295 BLM - DEGs and disease - activity signatures ; we considered a gene is shared when the BLM effect 296 had the opposite sign to the activity signature to reflect therapeutic responses ( Method ) . Jaccard 297 indexes in good responders were around 3 . 4 - fold higher than those in poor responders in B - lineage 298 cells ( Fig . 6b ) ; the analyses based on logFC also showed similar trends . ( Supplementary Note ; 299 Extended Data Fig . 9a - b ) . By projecting post - BLM data onto the PCA space of the discovery cohort 300 ( Methods ) , we evaluated the change in disease - activity PC scores between pre - and post - BLM . 301 Consistent with the DEG analysis , we found a significant decrease in unswitched memory B cells 302 ( USM B ) PC4 scores only for good responders ( linear mixed regression test , FDR = 9 . 9 × 10 - 3 ; Fig . 303 6d ) . Together , these results provided robust evidence supporting the association between disease - 304 activity signatures and the therapeutic response to BLM . 305 All rights reserved .

Importantly , 307 we treated disease activity as a potential confounder in this analysis ( Methods ) , and hence the MMF 308 effects are not biased by disease activity . DEGs between patients with and without MMF ( MMF - 309 DEGs ) were primarily observed in plasmablasts , followed by Th1 and central memory CD8 + T cells 310 ( CM CD8 ) ( Fig . 6e ) ; the same cell types were nominated by variance partitioning analysis ( Extended 311 Data Fig . 9c ; Supplementary Table 10 ) . MMF - DEGs were shared with the activity signature genes 312 with 15 . 0 - 21 . 7 % of the Jaccard index ( Fig . 6e ) . Pathway analysis recapitulated this shared 313 component : both genes showed enrichment for oxidative phosphorylation and E2F - related cell cycle 314 pathways ( Extended Data Fig . 9d ; Supplementary Table 12 ) . We also found a significant decrease 315 in disease - activity PC scores of plasmablasts ( PC1 ) in patients taking MMF , adjusted for disease 316 activity ( linear regression test , FDR = 6 . 3 × 10 - 3 ; Fig . 6f ; Methods ) . These results were consistent 317 with previous reports that MMF suppressed plasma cell differentiation 52 , 53 . 318 319 Risks variants for SLE are enriched around disease - state signatures , not activity signatures . 320 To estimate the causal roles of these signatures for the risk of disease onset , we integrated our 321 transcriptome data with the results of GWAS for SLE ( SLE - GWAS ; Fig . 1 , v ) . 322 First , we analyzed the genome - wide distribution of all risk variants irrespective of their effect 323 sizes and tested their enrichment around the signature genes using stratified linkage disequilibrium 324 score regression 26 , 54 ( S - LDSC ; Methods ) . To be in line with previous studies of S - LDSC , we 325 All rights reserved .

Since ancestry - specific GWAS 327 results are required in S - LDSC , we used two large - scale SLE - GWAS conducted in East Asian 328 ( EAS ) 23 and European ( EUR ) 22 populations . We confirmed that the S - LDSC results for EAS - and 329 EUR - GWAS were globally similar as reported for other traits 55 ( r in enrichment estimate = 0 . 69 ; P = 330 1 . 5 × 10 - 12 ; Extended Data Fig . 10a ; Supplementary Table 13 ) ; hence we combined them using a 331 fixed - effect meta - analysis . Consistent with previous reports 26 , the risk variants were predominantly 332 enriched around HC - SEG of B - lineage cells but only with a nominal significance ( minimum P = 0 . 028 333 for SM B ) : no significant enrichment at Bonferroni - corrected P < 0 . 05 ( Fig . 7a ) . Strikingly , compared 334 to HC - SEG , we found much stronger enrichments for disease - state signatures in all cell types : nine 335 significant enrichments . However , for disease - activity signatures , we found no significant enrichment . 336 Consistently , the enrichments were substantially weaker in the activity signatures than in the disease - 337 state signatures ( paired Wilcoxon test , P = 5 . 5 × 10 - 6 ) . 338 We next analyzed candidate causal genes implicated in SLE - GWAS ( Methods ; 339 Supplementary Table 14 ) and tested their enrichment in both signatures of each cell type ( Fig . 7b ; 340 Extended Data Fig . 10b ; Supplementary Table 15 ) . As in the S - LDSC results , the enrichments of 341 the candidate genes were predominantly observed in disease - state rather than in activity signatures ; 342 significant enrichments were found in five and zero cell types , respectively ( Bonferroni - corrected P < 343 0 . 05 ) . Again , the enrichments were weaker in activity signatures than disease - state signatures 344 All rights reserved .

These results confirmed that the risk variants locate on average 345 around disease - state and not activity signature genes . 346 Considering that most of the risk variants are within the gene regulatory regions 25 , we 347 hypothesized that risk variants possess gene regulatory effects on disease - state genes ( i . e . , eQTL 348 effects ; Fig . 7c ) . To test this hypothesis , we next evaluated the potential eQTL effects of the risk 349 variants on disease - state and activity signature genes . Specifically , we focused on genes affected by 350 the risk variants’ eQTL effects ( eGenes ) and asked how the risk alleles’ directional effects on eGenes 351 are consistent with our gene expression signatures ; an eGene with consistent direction is called a 352 “coherent gene” 56 ( Fig . 7d ; for this analysis , we utilized the colocalization test results between SLE - 353 GWAS risk variants and eQTL variants that we recently reported 27 ) . Intriguingly , the coherent genes 354 were enriched in disease - state signatures , but not in activity signatures ( Fig . 7e ; Supplementary 355 Table 16 ) : 67 % of eGene - cell type combinations were coherent in disease - state signatures whereas 356 only 25 % of combinations were coherent in activity signatures ( one - sided sign test , P = 0 . 022 and 357 0 . 99 , respectively ) . Together , these analyses demonstrated better directional compatibility of the SLE 358 risk allele’s effect with disease - state signatures rather than activity signatures . Although this might be 359 reasonable considering most GWAS are based on case - control design , this finding implied the failure 360 of current GWAS to capture the critical biology of SLE represented by disease - activity signatures . 361 While activity signature genes did not locate around the current SLE risk variants , we 362 speculated that some of them might contribute to the disease risk by modulating the eQTL effects of 363 risk alleles ( we refer to the genes with modulating eQTL effects as proxy genes [ pGenes ] 57 ; Fig . 7c ) . 364 All rights reserved .

We included 115 patients with available genotyping data and examined the 366 influence of disease - activity signatures genes on the eQTL effects of risk alleles ( we again utilized the 367 abovementioned colocalization results 27 ) . Intriguingly , we detected two significant pGenes among 368 activity signature genes ( ANOVA test , FDR < 0 . 05 ; Supplementary Data 6 ) , which included MED24 , 369 a transcriptional coactivator . MED24 is an activity signature gene of plasmablasts ( Fig . 7f , left ) , and 370 its expression was suppressed by MMF ( Extended Data Fig . 10c ) . MED24 significantly modulated 371 the eQTL effect of a SLE risk variant ( rs36059542 ) on ARHGAP31 , encoding a GTPase - activating 372 protein ( ANOVA test , FDR = 0 . 035 ; Fig . 7f , right ) . Of note , the eQTL effect of rs36059542 on 373 ARHGAP31 was observed only in plasmablasts 27 . Therefore , in addition to disease - state genes , 374 disease - activity genes may also contribute to genetic risk by modulating the eQTL effects of risk 375 alleles . Furthermore , MMF might indirectly suppress SLE genetic risk by controlling the MED24 376 expression . 377 378 All rights reserved .

We identified two distinct categories of lupus - 381 relevant signatures : disease - state and activity genes . These signatures revealed multiple novel and 382 underappreciated mechanisms with a fine cellular resolution . Moreover , we demonstrated the value 383 of these signatures in multiple applications : transferability to independent transcriptome datasets , 384 shared components with drug responses and consistency with the genetic signals . 385 SLE is a chronic disease characterized by relapsing and remitting disease course 1 – 3 . A 386 critical but unsolved question is how the multi - cellular pathophysiology is different ( or not different ) 387 between disease development and exacerbation stages . Most of the previous SLE transcriptome 388 studies have failed to provide clear answers since they separately conducted case - control and / or 389 intra - case analyses and have not directly compared both signatures in the same study with a high 390 cellular resolution . Our comprehensive transcriptome data successfully clarified the multiple cell - type - 391 specific immune - mediated pathways characteristic of disease - state and activity , which highlighted the 392 distinct biology behind the establishment and exacerbation phases of this disease . 393 The current realistic goal of SLE management is to achieve remission or low disease activity , 394 not a cure 58 – 60 . From this perspective , the disease - activity signature , not the disease - state signature , 395 has implications for development of biomarkers of treatment response or therapeutic targets . Indeed , 396 we observed shared components between the disease - activity signatures and transcriptome changes 397 in BLM good responders and in those taking MMF .

First , since we recruited established 402 SLE patients in the chronic phase , whether the disease - state signature genes indicate causality ( the 403 signatures induce disease - state ) or a reverse - causality ( the disease - state induces the signatures ) is a 404 critical question . Since the risk variants reflect the causality , the fact that the risk variants are 405 enriched around disease - state signature genes suggested the former scenario , further supported by 406 the consistency in the dysregulation direction ( i . e . , coherent genes ) . Moreover , this finding also 407 suggested that genetic risk - driven susceptibility signatures remained in clinically stable SLE patients , 408 indicating that the causal mechanism is not completely controlled by the current treatments . Second , 409 the current GWAS signals failed to reflect the disease - activity signatures . This is a critical limitation of 410 the current genetic studies considering the potential importance of activity signatures in drug target 411 discovery . To resolve this issue , a new framework of genetic study focusing on intra - case 412 heterogeneity ( e . g . , disease severity ) will be required . 413 Although our study has substantially improved our understanding of SLE biology , we need to 414 acknowledge several limitations . First , apart from the pre - and post - BLM sub - cohort , our study lacked 415 longitudinal data . Second , all participants in this study were from the EAS population , although we 416 demonstrated the applicability of our signatures to transcriptome data and GWAS results from 417 All rights reserved .

Third , our cell - sorting strategy might have failed to characterize currently 418 unidentified cell populations . 419 It is now clear that disease - state and activity signatures jointly maintain the complex 420 pathophysiology of SLE .

All participants were from the EAS ancestry . Healthy 587 volunteers were recruited at the Department of Allergy and Rheumatology at the University of Tokyo 588 Hospital . SLE patients were recruited at the Department of Allergy and Rheumatology at the 589 University of Tokyo Hospital , Division of Rheumatic Diseases at National Center for Global Health 590 and Medicine , or Immuno - Rheumatology Center at St . Luke’s International Hospital . Written informed 591 consent was obtained from all participants . We have complied with all of the relevant ethical 592 regulations . 593 All SLE patients met the 1997 revised version of the American College of Rheumatology 594 classification criteria 61 . The exclusion criteria for the discovery dataset ( including 136 SLE patients ) 595 were : i ) active malignancies or infections , ii ) use of more than 20mg prednisolone ( PSL ) daily or 596 equivalent at enrollment , iii ) receive of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse , cyclophosphamide , 597 rituximab , or BLM within 12 months before enrollment . 598 In addition , we also collected 22 paired samples just before and six months after the 599 additional therapy of BLM ( i . e . , pre - and post - BLM ) . Among the pre - BLM samples , 21 samples were 600 included in the discovery dataset , and one was re - sampled due to the interval between initial 601 enrollment and BLM induction . None of the post - BLM samples were included in the discovery 602 Nakano M et al . 43 dataset . Therefore , we recruited 248 donors in total : 136 unique SLE patients , one pre - BLM , 22 post - 603 BLM patients , and 89 healthy volunteers . 604 605 Sample processing and sequencing 606 In this study , all samples were collected based on phase 2 protocol in the ImmuNexUT 27 ; 27 immune 607 cell types were purified from peripheral blood of each donor ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . We first 608 isolated PBMCs by density gradient separation with Ficoll - Paque ( GE healthcare ) immediately after 609 the blood draw . Erythrocytes were lysed with Ammonium - Chloride - Potassium lysing buffer ( Gibco ) , 610 and non - specific binding was blocked with anti - human Fc - gamma receptor antibodies ( Thermo Fisher 611 Scientific ) . We next sorted PBMCs into 26 immune cell types with purity > 99 % using a 14 - color cell 612 sorter BD FACSAria Fusion ( BD Biosciences ) with the aim of 5 , 000 cells per sample . The immune 613 cell gating strategy for flow cytometry was based on the Human Immunology Project with slight 614 modification 62 . Sorted cells were lysed and stored at - 80 ℃ . RNA was extracted using MagMAX - 96 615 Total RNA Isolation Kits ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Libraries for RNA - seq were prepared using 616 SMART - seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit ( Takara Bio ) . Neutrophils were purified using MACSxpress 617 Neutrophil Isolation Kits human ( Miltenyi Biotec ) with the aim of 2×10 6 cells immediately after the 618 blood draw , lysed and stored at - 80 ℃ , followed by RNA isolation with an RNeasy Mini Kits ( QIAGEN ) 619 and library preparation with SMART - seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kits ( Takara Bio ) . All prepared 620 libraries were sequenced on HiSeq2500 ( 6169 samples ) or NovaSeq6000 ( 217 samples ) ( Illumina ) to 621 generate 100 or 150 base paired - end reads , respectively . Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral 622 Nakano M et al . 44 blood using QIAmp DNA Blood Midi kit ( QIAGEN ) . Libraries were prepared using TruSeq DNA PCR - 623 Free Library prep kit ( Illumina ) , followed by whole - genome sequencing ( WGS ) . WGS was performed 624 only for the samples from Japanese individuals . The details of WGS data processing were reported in 625 our previous study 27 . 626 627 Quantification and normalization of the expression data 628 Adaptor sequences were trimmed using Cutadapt ( v1 . 16 ) and reads containing low - quality bases 629 ( Phred quality score < 20 in > 20 % of the bases ) were removed . Reads were aligned against the 630 GRCh38 reference sequence using STAR 63 ( v2 . 5 . 3 ) with the UCSC ( downloaded from illumina 631 iGenome reference collection , archive - 2015 - 08 - 14 - 08 - 18 - 15 ) and expression was counted with 632 HTSeq 64 . 633 We applied multiple sample quality control ( QC ) steps to ensure high quality data . The 634 samples with uniquely mapped read rates < 80 % or unique read counts < 5 × 10 6 were excluded as 635 low - quality samples . To exclude outlier samples , we calculated Spearman’s correlations of the 636 expressions between two samples from the same cell type and then removed the samples with mean 637 correlation coefficients < 0 . 9 . In addition , to exclude potentially swapped samples , we calculated the 638 concordance rates between RNA - seq - based genotype and WGS - based genotype at the 639 heterozygous loci and excluded samples with concordance rate < 0 . 9 . 640 We then filtered out low expression genes ( < 10 counts or < 1 count per million [ CPM ] in > 641 85 % of samples ) , followed by a trimmed mean of M values ( TMM ) normalization with R ( v4 . 0 . 2 ) 642 Nakano M et al . 45 package edgeR ( v3 . 32 . 1 ) 65 in each cell type . Normalized expression data were converted to log - 643 transformed count per million ( i . e . , log [ CPM + 1 ] ) . The batch effects ( i . e . , product lots in SMART - seq 644 v4 and sequencer ; Extended Data Fig . 2a ) were removed using Combat software 66 . To verify the 645 successful work of the batch correction procedure , we used principal variance component analysis ; 646 we first calculated the explained variance of each clinical parameter for each PC1 - 7 score with the 647 linear mixed models in R package lme4 ( v1 . 1 - 27 . 1 ) 67 and then inferred the average value of the 648 explained variance weighted by each PC’s eigenvalue ( Extended Data Fig . 2b ) . 649 650 PCA and UMAP of all samples 651 For PCA and UMAP using all samples ( Extended Data Fig . 1b - c ) , we combined the expression data 652 after batch correction from each cell type and used the intersection of the genes ( n = 8397 ) that 653 passed the filtering of low expression in each cell type . For UMAP , we used R package uwot ( v 654 0 . 1 . 10 ) with default parameters 68 . 655 656 PCA in each cell type of the discovery dataset 657 For PCA in each cell type of the discovery cohort , we used the top 10 , 000 variable genes from the 658 expression data after batch correction in each cell type ( Fig . 2b ; Extended Data Fig . 3 ) . 659 To calculate the proportion of sum squared deviations within HC , SLE , and between HC and 660 SLE data in each cell type ( Fig . 2c ) , we used the PC1 - 7 data of the discovery dataset 661 Nakano M et al . 46 ( Supplementary Note ) . We first calculated the proportion of sum squared deviations for each PC 662 score and then inferred the average value of the proportion weighted by each PC’s eigenvalue . 663 664 Weighted variance partitioning analysis in each cell type 665 To calculate the explained variance of each clinical parameter within SLE transcriptome data for each 666 cell type , we performed weighted variance partitioning analysis using the PC1 - 7 data of the discovery 667 dataset ( Supplementary Note ) . We first calculated the explained variance of each clinical parameter 668 for each PC score using the linear mixed models in R package variancePartition ( v1 . 20 . 0 ) 69 and then 669 inferred the average value of the explained variance weighted by each PC’s eigenvalue ( Fig . 2d , 5c ; 670 Extended Data Fig . 8 , 9c ; Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . 671 To verify whether the inferred explained variance was not biased by outlier samples , we 672 estimated standard errors ( S . E . ) of the explained variance by jackknife resampling method . When we 673 had n samples for one cell type , we re - calculated the explained variance n times by excluding each 674 one of the samples . We then evaluated the distribution of n explained variance and quantified its S . E . 675 For each clinical parameter , we compared the explained variance in each cell type against the 676 median explained variance across all 27 cell types . To assess the significance of the difference 677 observed in this comparison for a cell type , we utilized n explained variance calculated in jackknife 678 resampling for that cell type ; among n values , we calculated the proportion of the values which was 679 smaller than the median value , and we defined this proportion as jackknife resampling P ( P jk ) . For 680 each clinical parameter , if one cell type passed the Bonferroni - corrected P jk < 0 . 05 , we concluded that 681 Nakano M et al . 47 the clinical parameter significantly contributed to the within - SLE transcriptome variation in that cell 682 type . 683 684 Linear models for the association between PC scores and clinical parameters 685 This study focused on the clinical parameters related to disease - state , overall disease - activity , 686 organ / domain activity , and treatment statuses ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Disease - state was defined 687 as the contrast between inactive SLE ( i . e . , not all SLE ) and HC in the discovery dataset to exclude 688 the elements of disease - activity signatures from the case - control contrast ( Fig . 1 , middle ) . For 689 overall disease activity , we defined four categories : i ) inactive as SLEDAI - 2K 28 = 0 , ii ) low disease 690 activity ( LDA ) as 1 ≤ SLEDAI - 2K ≤ 4 , iii ) moderate disease activity ( MDA ) as 5 ≤ SLEDAI - 2K ≤ 8 , and 691 iv ) high disease activity ( HDA ) as SLEDAI - 2K ≥ 9 . For organ activity , we categorized the patients into 692 seven groups based on their actively involved organ / domains of the British Isles Lupus Assessment 693 Group ( BILAG ) 2004 29 and SELDAI - 2K : a ) constitutional , b ) mucocutaneous , c ) musculoskeletal , d ) 694 renal , e ) extrarenal severe ( neuropsychiatric / eye , cardiorespiratory and / or gastrointestinal ) , f ) 695 hematological , and g ) serological activities . We also evaluated the effect of therapeutic agents such 696 as MMF , hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) , and tacrolimus ( TAC ) 3 , 60 , 70 . 697 To examine the associations between the PC scores ( PC1 - 30 ) and clinical traits , we fitted 698 the PC scores to the following linear regression models : 699 ( 1 ) For disease - state ( 𝑥 : inactive SLE vs . HC ) , 700 𝑦 = 𝛽 ∙ 𝑥 [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝜀 ∙ 𝐴𝑔𝑒 [ 𝑦𝑟𝑠 ] + 𝜖 ∙ 𝑆𝑒𝑥 [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝜃 701 Nakano M et al . 48 Here , 𝑦 represents the scaled PC score for each cell type ( PC1 - 30 × 27 cell types ) . All PC scores 702 were scaled across samples to enable the direct comparison of the effect sizes in the associations 703 with clinical parameters . In this comparison , age and sex were included as covariates . 704 ( 2 ) For disease - activity ( 𝑥 : HDA vs . inactive SLE ; we also examined LDA vs . inactive and MDA vs . 705 inactive SLE ) , 706 𝑦 = 𝛽 ∙ 𝑥 [ 0 , 1 ] + 6 𝛾 ∙ 𝐼 ! [ 0 , 1 ] ! " # , % , & + 𝛿 ∙ 𝑃𝑆𝐿 [ 𝑚𝑔 ] + 𝜀 ∙ 𝐴𝑔𝑒 [ 𝑦𝑟𝑠 ] + 𝜖 ∙ 𝑆𝑒𝑥 [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝜃 707 Here , 𝐼 ! ( 𝑘 = 1 , 2 , 3 ) represents each immunosuppressant ( MMF , HCQ , TAC ) as covariates . 708 ( 3 ) For organ / domain activity ( 𝑥 ’ [ 𝑗 = 1 … 7 ] : the abovementioned seven categories ) , 709 𝑦 = 6 𝛽 ∙ 𝑥 ’ [ 0 , 1 ] ’ " # … ) + 6 𝛾 ∙ 𝐼 ! [ 0 , 1 ] ! " # , % , & + 𝛿 ∙ 𝑃𝑆𝐿 [ 𝑚𝑔 ] + 𝜀 ∙ 𝐴𝑔𝑒 [ 𝑦𝑟𝑠 ] + 𝜖 ∙ 𝑆𝑒𝑥 [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝜃 710 Here , we constructed multiple linear regression models including all seven categories , which enabled 711 us to infer the association of each organ activity with PC scores , controlling the other organs’ effects 712 ( Fig . 5c - d ) . 713 ( 4 ) For therapeutic agents ( 𝐼 ! [ 𝑘 = 1 , 2 , 3 ] : MMF , HCQ , TAC ) , 714 𝑦 = 6 𝛾 ∙ 𝐼 ! [ 0 , 1 ] ! " # , % , & + 𝛽 ∙ 𝑥 [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ] + 𝛿 ∙ 𝑃𝑆𝐿 [ 𝑚𝑔 ] + 𝜀 ∙ 𝐴𝑔𝑒 [ 𝑦𝑟𝑠 ] + 𝜖 ∙ 𝑆𝑒𝑥 [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝜃 715 Here , 𝑥 represents disease activity ( inactive , LDA , MDA , and HDA ) as covariates . 716 These equations enabled us to derive the associations of disease - state , activity , organ 717 involvements or treatment statuses with PC scores , adjusted for other confounding factors . Statistical 718 significance was set at FDR < 0 . 05 . As described in Supplementary Note and Supplementary Fig . 719 1b , most of the significant associations were detected within PC1 - 7 , with larger numbers than 720 average per PCs . Therefore , we confirmed that PC1 - 7 is a minimum set to associate the 721 Nakano M et al . 49 transcriptome with the clinical parameters in the discovery dataset and utilized PC1 - 7 scores for the 722 subsequent analyses . All PC scores were signed so that the effect sizes of disease - state and 723 disease - activity were positive ( Fig . 5a - b ; Extended Data Fig . 7a - b ) . In the case of some PCs that 724 had opposite sign in the effect sizes of disease - state and activity , the association with lower P value 725 was prioritized to have positive effect size . 726 In the hierarchical clustering of 225 unique individuals using 189 PCs ( = 7 PCs × 27 cell 727 types ) in the discovery dataset , the Euclidean distances of the PC scores were used with Ward’s 728 method ( Fig . 5a ; Extended Data Fig . 7a ) . 729 730 Differential gene expression analysis 731 To detect DEGs in each cell type , we fitted the TMM - normalized counts in the discovery dataset to 732 the generalized linear models ( GLM ) with negative binomial distribution using edgeR ( v3 . 32 . 1 ) 65 . The 733 equations in these GLM models were consistent with those in the linear models as described in the 734 Methods ; Linear models for the association between PC scores and clinical parameters ; we 735 utilized the equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) . Additionally , we also considered the batch effects as covariates 736 in this analysis since TMM - normalized counts were not corrected for batch effects ( Methods ; 737 Quantification and normalization of the expression data ) . These equations enabled us to derive 738 DEGs related to our focused disease traits or treatment statuses , adjusted for other confounding 739 factors ( Fig . 3a - b , 6e ; Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . Statistical significance was set at FDR < 0 . 05 . We 740 defined ( 1 ) “disease - state signature genes” as significant DEGs between inactive SLE and HC , and 741 Nakano M et al . 50 ( 2 ) “disease - activity signature genes” as significant DEGs between HDA and inactive SLE for each 742 cell type ( Fig . 3a ) . 743 To evaluate the similarities and differences between disease - state and activity signature 744 genes , we calculated Jaccard similarity indexes as the ratio of the shared genes with the concordant 745 sign between the disease - state and activity signatures ( Fig . 3a ; orange dots ) over the union of these 746 two signature genes ( Fig . 3a ; orange + red + blue dots ) for each cell type . Considering the biological 747 significance , we did not regard the DEGs with the discordant sign between these two signatures as 748 shared genes . Based on the proportion of DEGs and Jaccard index , we classified 27 cell types into 749 three patterns ( Fig . 3b ) . We first defined the cell types with Jaccard index > 0 . 15 as shared pattern 750 and then classified the other cell types into disease - state or disease - activity dominant patterns based 751 on which signature genes were numerically predominant . 752 We also calculated the Jaccard similarity index and Spearman correlation across all pairs of 753 different cell types for both signature genes . The Jaccard similarity distances ( i . e . , 1 - Jaccard 754 similarity indexes ) of each pair within disease - state signature genes were used for hierarchical 755 clustering ( Fig . 3d ) . Similarly , Spearman’s correlation distance of each pair within disease - activity 756 signature genes were used for hierarchical clustering ( Extended Data Fig . 4d ) . 757 To detect DEGs related to therapeutic agents adjusted for confounding factors ( e . g . , disease 758 activity ) , we set the patients not taking the agent as the control , meaning the down - DEGs 759 represented the genes that were downregulated by each agent . Therefore , we calculated Jaccard 760 indexes as the ratio of the shared genes with the inverse sign between the disease - activity signatures 761 Nakano M et al . 51 and MMF - DEGs over the union of these two signature genes ( Fig . 6e ) . We calculated Jaccard 762 indexes within the cell types in which more than 300 MMF - DEGs were observed . 763 764 Replication analysis 765 For replication analysis , we compared our data with the three external bulk immune cell RNA - seq 766 dataset of SLE and / or HC from different ancestries . 767 i ) Cohort 1 ( Panwar et al . 33 ) 768 • Samples : 64 SLE and 24 HC , multi - ancestry cohort ( Caucasian , Asian , Hispanic , and African ) 769 • Cell subsets : six cell types ( bulk T cells , bulk B cells , CL Mono , mDC , pDC , and Neu ) . Only 770 CL Mono was collected from all donors , and the other five cell types were collected from 771 around 20 SLE and 10 HC samples . 772 • Data usage strategy : since this cohort included both SLE and HC , we used this cohort for the 773 replication analysis of disease - state and activity signatures ( Extended Data Fig . 5a - c ) . Naive 774 CD4 and naive B data from the current study were compared with bulk T and bulk B data from 775 cohort 1 , respectively ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . 776 ii ) Cohort 2 ( Takeshima et al . 35 ) 777 • Samples : 30 SLE and 37 HC , All East Asian ( EAS ) 778 • Cell subsets : 19 cell types ( Naive CD4 , Mem CD4 , Th1 , Th2 , Th17 , Tfh , Fr . II eTreg , Naive 779 CD8 , bulk memory CD8 [ Mem CD8 ] , NK , Naive B , USM B , SM B , DN B , plasmablast , CL 780 Mono , CD16p Mono , mDC , and pDC ) 781 Nakano M et al . 52 • Data usage strategy : this is our previous cohort independent of the ImmuNexUT . In this 782 study , we excluded the overlapped samples with the current study , leaving relatively stable 783 30 SLE patients for the analysis . Therefore , we used this cohort only for the replication of 784 disease - state signatures ( Extended Data Fig . 5a , c ) . EM CD8 data from the current study 785 was compared with bulk Mem CD8 data from cohort 2 ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . 786 iii ) Cohort 3 ( Andreoletti et al . 34 ) 787 • Samples : 57 White and 63 Asian SLE patients 788 • Cell subsets : four cell types ( bulk CD4 cells , NK cells , bulk B cells , and bulk monocytes ) 789 • Data usage strategy : since this cohort did not include HC samples , we used this cohort only 790 for the replication of disease - activity signatures ( Extended Data Fig . 5b - c ) . Naive CD4 , naive 791 B , and CL Mono data from the current study were compared with bulk CD4 , bulk B , and bulk 792 monocyte data from cohort 3 , respectively ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . 793 In all replications , we assessed the concordance of the directions of disease - state and 794 activity signature genes in the discovery cohort with the corresponding genes in external cohorts 795 using one - sided binomial sign tests ( Extended Data Fig . 5a - b ) . The definitions of clinical status ( e . g . , 796 disease - state and activity ) were consistent with our discovery cohort , with the exception that inactive 797 SLE in cohort 2 was defined as 0 ≤ SLEDAI - 2K ≤ 2 ( 10 patients ) since there were no patients with 798 SLEDAI - 2K = 0 . In all replication analyses , we adjusted for the covariates ( e . g . , age and sex ) in line 799 with the analyses of the discovery dataset where applicable . 800 Nakano M et al . 53 In the PC projection method , we first computed the Z score matrix of gene expressions using 801 the mean and standard deviation ( SD ) of the discovery dataset and then inferred the PC scores of 802 each sample from the external datasets as the inner products of each PC loading ( Supplementary 803 Data 1 ) and the Z score matrix . We tested the association of these PC scores with disease - state ( i . e . , 804 inactive SLE vs . HC ) and disease - activity ( i . e . , HDA vs . inactive SLE ) in the external datasets using 805 the linear regression model as with the discovery dataset ( Supplementary Table 9 ) . We then 806 assessed the concordance of the directions of the effect sizes for disease - state and disease - activity 807 PCs , respectively , using one - sided binomial sign tests ( Supplementary Note ; Extended Data Fig . 808 5c ) . 809 810 Transcription factor and pathway enrichment analysis 811 To test pathway and transcription factor ( TF ) enrichment in each disease - state and activity signature 812 genes , we performed over - representation analyses with one - sided Fisher’s exact test in R package 813 clusterProfiler ( v . 3 . 18 . 1 ) 71 . Statistical significance was set at FDR < 0 . 05 . For TF datasets , we used 814 the Molecular Signatures Database ( MsigDB ) C3 all TF targets annotation ( 1133 annotations ) 72 . For 815 pathway datasets , we used the MsigDB hallmark gene set collection ( 50 annotations ) 73 and Kyoto 816 Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) pathway ( 548 annotations ) 74 . To capture the cell - type - 817 specific biology linked to disease - state and activity signatures genes , we set the union of both 818 signature genes in all cell types as the background gene sets . For treatment - related DEGs ( e . g . , 819 Nakano M et al . 54 MMF - DEGs and BLM - DEGs ) , we performed pathway enrichment analysis only in the cell types in 820 which more than 300 DEGs were observed . 821 822 Analysis of pre - and post - BLM dataset 823 All 22 individuals received BLM treatment according to the standard protocols 6 , 7 , 75 . In this section , we 824 defined those whose original disease - activity categories were moved into one or more lower 825 categories ( e . g . , MDA to LDA or LDA to inactive ) between pre - and post - BLM treatment , as good 826 responders , and the others as poor responders . 827 Because edgeR did not implement generalized linear mixed models ( GLMM ) , we detected 828 DEGs between pre - and post - BLM using the following GLMM with negative binomial distribution in 829 lme4 ( v1 . 1 - 27 . 1 ) 67 , setting the statistical significance at FDR < 0 . 05 ( Fig . 6a - b ) . Of note , we need to 830 consider the batch effects as covariates in the following equation , since TMM - normalized counts were 831 not corrected for batch effects ( Methods ; Quantification and normalization of the expression 832 data ) . 833 𝑦 = 𝛽 ∙ 𝐵𝐿𝑀 [ 0 , 1 ] + ( 1 | 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 ) + 𝜋 ∙ 𝐵𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ + 𝜃 834 Here , 𝑦 and 𝐵𝐿𝑀 represents the TMM - normalized count for each gene in each cell type 835 and the treatment status of BLM ( i . e . , pre - and post - BLM ) . We included a term for random intercept of 836 individuals , and hence excluded individual - specific covariates ( e . g . , age and sex ) . In this equation , we 837 set pre - BLM as the control , meaning the down - DEGs represented the genes that were 838 downregulated by BLM treatment . Therefore , we calculated Jaccard indexes as the ratio of the 839 Nakano M et al . 55 shared genes with the inverse sign between the disease - activity signatures and BLM - related DEGs 840 over the union of these two signature genes ( Fig . 6b ) . We calculated Jaccard indexes within the cell 841 types in which more than 300 BLM - DEGs were observed . Moreover , in each cell type , we compared 842 associations between the logFC of disease - activity effect and those in BLM effect using linear 843 regression model ( Supplementary Note ; Extended Data Fig . 9a - b ) . 844 In the PC projection method , we first computed the Z score matrix of gene expressions using 845 the mean and SD of the discovery dataset and then inferred the PC scores of duplicated samples as 846 the inner products of each PC loading ( Supplementary Data 1 ) and the Z score matrix . To test the 847 association between the change of PC scores and the treatment status , we used the following linear 848 mixed model : 849 𝑦 = 𝛽 ∙ 𝐵𝐿𝑀 [ 0 , 1 ] + ( 1 | 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 ) + 𝜃 850 Here , 𝑦 represents the scaled PC score for each cell type . In this model , it was not necessary to 851 consider the batch effects since the PCA was performed using the log ( CPM + 1 ) gene expression data 852 that had been already corrected for batch effects ( Methods ; Quantification and normalization of 853 the expression data ) . 854 855 Stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression 856 To evaluate the enrichment of the genome - wide distribution of all SLE risk variants irrespective of 857 their effect sizes ( heritability ) around HC - SEG , disease - state and activity signature genes , we 858 performed S - LDSC 26 , 54 . We examined the enrichment of SLE heritability for common variants within 859 Nakano M et al . 56 100 - kb windows on either side of the transcription start site of the genes with the top 1 , 000 highest Z - 860 scores in either signature genes for each cell type , adjusting for baseline model provided by the 861 developers 54 ( Fig . 7a ) . For this analysis , we used two large - scale SLE GWAS summary statistics 862 from EAS 23 and EUR ancestries 22 ( Extended Data Fig . 10a ) . Since the regression coefficients of S - 863 LDSC are influenced by the GWAS heritability , we normalized coefficients by dividing them with 864 mean per - SNP heritability as reported by a previous report 26 ; we then reported normalized 865 coefficients . In a fixed - effect meta - analysis of the two results , we used the inverse variance weighting 866 method using normalized coefficients and their S . E . We reported P values to test whether the 867 regression coefficient is significantly positive . 868 To call HC - SEG ( specifically expressed genes in HC ) for each cell type , we compared the 869 expression data of one cell type with that of the remaining cell types that belong to other cell lineages 870 using the GLM with negative binomial distribution in edgeR ( v3 . 32 . 1 ) 65 . To be in line with previous 871 studies of S - LDSC , only the samples from HC were used in this analysis . 872 873 GWAS candidate genes enrichment analysis 874 The SLE - GWAS results were downloaded from the NHGRI - EBI GWAS Catalog 76 on 16 / 08 / 2021 . 875 Among them , we defined the genes nearest to SLE - GWAS significant variants ( P < 5 × 10 - 8 ) as 876 GWAS candidate genes ( Supplementary Table 14 ) . Gene symbols were based on UCSC definition . 877 To test the enrichment of GWAS candidate genes for disease - state and activity signature genes , we 878 performed over - representation analyses with one - sided Fisher’s exact test ( Fig . 7b ) . We set the 879 Nakano M et al . 57 union of the genes that passed the filtering of low expression in each cell type and used it as the 880 background . 881 882 Integrative analysis with eQTL data 883 To compare the direction between the risk allele’s expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTL ) effects and 884 disease - state and activity signature genes , we utilized the results of the colocalization test between 885 SLE - GWAS and ImmuNexUT eQTL data reported in Ota et al 27 . For visualization , logFC sign 886 information was adjusted so that the direction of the coherent genes , which showed the concordant 887 direction between eQTL effects for risk alleles and differential expressions 56 ( Fig . 7e ) , was positive 888 ( i . e . , adjusted logFC ) . 889 To examine the interactive effects of the signature genes on the eQTL effects of SLE risk 890 variants , we fitted the eGene expressions to the following linear regression models for each cell type 891 ( Fig . 7f ) : 892 𝐹𝑢𝑙𝑙 : 𝑦 = 𝜌 ∙ 𝐺 [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] + 𝜇 ∙ 𝑥 + 𝛽 ∙ 𝐺 : 𝑥 + 6 𝛾 ∙ 𝐼 ! [ 0 , 1 ] ! " # , % , & + 𝛿 ∙ 𝑃𝑆𝐿 [ 𝑚𝑔 ] + 𝜀 ∙ 𝐴𝑔𝑒 [ 𝑦𝑟𝑠 ] + 𝜖 ∙ 𝑆𝑒𝑥 [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝜃 893 𝑁𝑢𝑙𝑙 : 𝑦 = 𝜌 ∙ 𝐺 [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] + 𝜇 ∙ 𝑥 + 6 𝛾 ∙ 𝐼 ! [ 0 , 1 ] ! " # , % , & + 𝛿 ∙ 𝑃𝑆𝐿 [ 𝑚𝑔 ] + 𝜀 ∙ 𝐴𝑔𝑒 [ 𝑦𝑟𝑠 ] + 𝜖 ∙ 𝑆𝑒𝑥 [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝜃 894 Here , 𝑦 and 𝑥 represents the expression of eGene and pGene , respectively , and 𝐺 895 represents the genotype of each individual . 𝐼 ! ( 𝑘 = 1 , 2 , 3 ) represents each immunosuppressant 896 ( MMF , HCQ , TAC ) as covariates . We tested the significance of interaction terms ( i . e . , 𝐺 : 𝑥 ) by 897 comparing full and null models using analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) . Statistical significance was set at 898 FDR < 0 . 05 . 899 Nakano M et al . 58 900 Data availability 901 All analysis results including DEG list and PC loading scores are available as supplementary table 902 and data .
