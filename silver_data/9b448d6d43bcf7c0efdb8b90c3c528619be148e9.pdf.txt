Here , SIRP a on macrophages from mouse and human marrow was inhibited to block recognition of its ligand , the ‘‘marker of self’’ CD47 on all other cells . These macrophages were then sys - temically injected into mice with ﬂuorescent human tumors that had been antibody targeted . Within days , the tumors regressed , and single - cell ﬂuores - cence analyses showed that the more the macro - phages engulfed , the more they accumulated within regressing tumors . Human - marrow - derived macro - phages engorged on the human tumors , while TAMs were minimally phagocytic , even toward CD47 - knockdown tumors . Past studies had opson - ized tumors in situ with antibody and / or relied on mouse TAMs but had not injected SIRP a - inhibited cells ; also , unlike past injections of anti - CD47 , blood parameters remained normal and safe . Consistent with tumor - selective engorge - and - accumulate pro - cesses in vivo , phagocytosis in vitro inhibited macro - phage migration through micropores that mimic features of dense 3D tissue . Accumulation of SIRP a - inhibited macrophages in tumors favored tumor regression for 1 – 2 weeks , but donor macro - phages quickly differentiated toward non - phago - cytic , high - SIRP a TAMs . Analyses of macrophages on soft ( like marrow ) or stiff ( like solid tumors ) collag - enous gels demonstrated a stiffness - driven , retinoic - acid - modulated upregulation of SIRP a and the mechanosensitive nuclear marker lamin - A . Mecha - nosensitive differentiation was similarly evident in vivo and likely limited the anti - tumor effects , as conﬁrmed by re - initiation of tumor regression by fresh injections of SIRP a - inhibited macrophages . Macrophage motility , phagocytosis , and differentia - tion in vivo are thus coupled . INTRODUCTION Macrophages and monocytes engorge and accumulate within solid tissues in various inﬂammatory diseases [ 1 ] , but general mechanisms have remained obscure and any relevance of ‘‘engorge and accumulate’’ to solid tumors is unclear . Blood - borne ‘‘patrolling monocytes’’ can pinch off fragments of cancer cells within hours of the cancer cells lodging in the lung after their intravenous injection [ 2 ] , but for well - established solid tumors it remains unclear whether such marrow - derived phagocytes can migrate into the tumor , completely engulf a cancer cell , and maintain a phagocytic phenotype . Tumor - associated macro - phages ( TAMs ) are remarkably motile even within highly collag - enous solid tumors [ 3 ] , but TAMs are differentiated and less phagocytic than macrophages in other tissues [ 4 ] , with a high density of TAMs correlating with poor clinical prognosis ( e . g . , [ 5 ] ) . Systemic injection of phagocytic marrow - derived macro - phages might help with tumor clearance , and injection of (cid:1) 10 9 macrophages into cancer patients can be safe even if ineffective thus far [ 6 ] . How any cell , including a cancer cell , avoids being engulfed by an activated macrophage could partially involve signaling by ‘‘marker of self’’ CD47 to the phagocyte’s receptor SIRP a [ 7 – 10 ] . Although the viability of Cd47 and Sirpa knockout mice suggests the interaction is non - essential [ 7 , 11 ] , in vivo knock - down of mCD47 in tumors can slow tumor growth , and systemic poisoning of macrophages eliminates growth suppression [ 12 ] . Human tumors in mice also regress after systemic injection of anti - hCD47 when combined with a distinct antibody ( Ab ) that opsonizes the human cancer cells ( e . g . , [ 8 ] ) . However , direct measurements are lacking for engulfment of cancer cells by macrophages in tumors , and mouse macrophages could perceive human cancer cells as foreign by many pathways . In addition , CD47 is expressed on all cells but varies between spe - cies , so that species - matched anti - CD47 injections ( e . g . , anti - mCD47 into mouse ) understandably cause rapid and reproduc - ible depletion of blood cells—even when effects on tumors have been questioned in replication studies [ 13 ] . Initial clinical trials of anti - hCD47 safety ( reviewed in [ 14 ] ) further motivate a Current Biology 27 , 2065 – 2077 , July 24 , 2017 ª 2017 Elsevier Ltd . 2065 A B C D E G H F ( legend on next page ) 2066 Current Biology 27 , 2065 – 2077 , July 24 , 2017 concentrated study of the basic biology and coupling of macro - phage trafﬁcking , phagocytosis , and differentiation in tumors . Here , we engineer and then systemically inject highly phago - cytic marrow - derived macrophages that have both SIRP a inhibi - tion and tumor - targeting Abs pre - loaded into Fc receptors ( Figures 1A , left , and S1 ) . Such SIRP a - inhibited macrophages are denoted here as A’PB macrophages ( Ab - primed Plus SIRP a Blocked macrophages ) and extend past efforts with Ab - targeted macrophages ( reviewed in [ 14 ] ) . In previous studies on hour timescales , anti - SIRP a increased phagocytosis of Ab - opson - ized targets both in vitro [ 7 , 15 ] and in vivo [ 10 ] , but macrophage trafﬁcking and function for days or weeks in the more biological contexts of circulation and 3D tissue microenvironments present a distinct challenge . On long timescales , in vitro differentiation of macrophages [ 16 , 17 ] and other adherent marrow cells [ 18 , 19 ] is modulated by the stiffness of their microenvironments among other factors , but in vivo evidence is lacking . We use human solid tumor models established in NSG mice ( non - obese diabetic / severe combined IL - 2R g mice ) , which lack T cells , B cells ( and Abs ) , and natural killer ( NK ) cells while maintaining func - tional monocytes , macrophages , and neutrophils [ 20 ] . We ultimately show that tail - vein - injected A’PB macrophages avidly engulf cancer cells in solid tumors as the macrophages accumulate and the tumors regress until efﬁcacy is limited by macrophage differentiation , which takes days and appears mechanosensitive . RESULTS Engorge and Accumulate : Donor Macrophages in Tumors Are More Phagocytic Than TAMs Two key issues to address initially were ( 1 ) whether tail - vein - in - jected marrow monocytes and macrophages ( denoted simply as macrophages ) trafﬁc into a human solid tumor , and ( 2 ) whether such cells can efﬁciently phagocytose human tumor cells . Mouse marrow cells were labeled with a green ﬂuorophore ( CFDA ) andthenengineeredtobeA’PBmacrophages ( Figure1A , left , and STAR Methods ) . The tumor - targeting Abs are all human speciﬁc ( Figure S1 ) : monoclonal Abs against MUC1 and EGFR ( Cetuximab ) have been clinically tested against lung cancers [ 21 , 22 ] , and a polyclonal anti - human immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) ( anti - hum ) binds multiple human antigens to minimize selection of cancer cell subpopulations . From (cid:1) 4 to (cid:1) 10 M freshly pre - pared A’PB macrophages ( or APB macrophages that lack pre - loaded opsonizing Ab ) were tail - vein injected into mice bearing large ( (cid:1) 1 cm 2 ) solid tumors of human lung carcinoma A549 cells that express tdTomato ( Figure 1A , middle ) . Many previous studies with engineered T cells likewise injected (cid:1) 10 M cells ( e . g . , [ 23 ] ) . Mice were sacriﬁced 3 days after systemic injections of macrophages and targeting Abs ( Table S1 lists standard amounts ) . Tumors and other tissues were quickly isolated , dis - aggregated , and analyzed with a focus on immune cells that were tdTom + ( indicating phagocytosis ) and also positive for sur - face markers F4 / 80 and ( when possible ) CD11b for tissue mac - rophages [ 24 ] ( Figure S2 ) . Confocal imaging ( Figure 1B ) of such a dispersed tumor from mice treated with A’PB macrophages reveals interactions with cancer cells and cancer cell internalization into phagosomes . Complete engulfment is evident from an absence of secondary stain for opsonizing Ab , which is otherwise abundant on tdTom + A549 cells ( Figure S2 ) . Macrophages are thus internalizing Ab together with Fc receptor . Such images of engorgement are consistent with ﬂow cytometry measures of high scatter for tdTom + macrophages ( Figure S2 ) . All tdTom + macrophages showedatdTomintensityroughlyequivalenttooneA549cell ( Fig - ure 1C ) , with the most phagocytic cells ( A’PB macrophage ) showingthehighestintensity . DistributionsofmacrophagetdTom intensities are broader and skewed to lower signal compared to cancercells ( Figure1C , histogram ) , suggestingcancercelldegra - dation after engulfment . Human nuclei are prominent in imaging , and tdTom + macrophages likewise exhibit more DNA by about one cancer cell nucleus compared to tdTom – macrophages ( Fig - ure 1C ) . This suggests slow degradation of tumor DNA . TdTom + donor macrophages are detected in tumors but not elsewhere ( Figure 1D ) . Donor macrophages thus trafﬁc into tumors but do not trafﬁc elsewhere after they engulf a cancer cell . About 90 % of A’PB and APB macrophage in tumors are tdTom + ( Figures 1D and 1E ) . Only 30 % of donor macrophage that lack SIRP a inhibition are tdTom + in tumors even with sys - temic anti - hum Ab . Only 10 % A’PB loaded with pre - immune Figure 1 .

Fluorophore CFDA labels the cells green . Cells are injected into tumor - bearing , immunodeﬁcient mice ( Table S1 ) , and , in some experiments , targeting Ab was not pre - loaded but was injected . Recipient mice injected with anti - hum Ab on day 3 were sacriﬁced 3 hr later . Tissues and tumors were analyzed for phagocytosis ( i . e . , tdTom + ) by imaging and ﬂow cytometry .

( H ) Growth kinetics of tdTom A549 tumors at subcutaneous ( SubQ ) or intraperitoneal ( IP ) sites treated with either of two sorted fractions of mouse marrow . After cell injections , mice were injected three times per week with anti - human ( Figure S2 ; n R 4 mice / group ) . Error bars in ( D ) – ( H ) represent mean + SEM . Current Biology 27 , 2065 – 2077 , July 24 , 2017 2067 Ab are tdTom + in tumors . TAMs are also minimally phago - cytic : < 5 % oftheserecipientmacrophage aretdTom + ( Figure1D , inset ) , and this almost vanishes in the absence of opsonizing Ab ( Figure 1E ) . However , in CD47 knockdown ( KD ) tumors : 12 % of TAMs are tdTom + after Ab injections ( Figure 1F ) , whereas donor marrow macrophage without SIRP a inhibition are > 3 - fold more phagocytic toward the CD47 - KD cells . Donor macrophages that engorge also accumulate more so in tumors than other tissues following systemic injection of anti - hum Ab ( Figure 1G ) . Injections of 7 . 5 and 3 . 8 M cells gave similar (cid:1) 1 . 5k donor macrophages per 100k tumor cells . Our ﬂow cy - tometry measurements of tumors are conducted on 2 M total cells that constitute (cid:1) 0 . 5 % – 5 % of total tumor volume , which equates to (cid:1) 600k – 6 M donor macrophages inﬁltrating the tu - mors , so that any excess macrophages disperse to other tissues and / or die . Importantly , A’PB macrophage distribute relatively evenly between tumor periphery and core , whereas TAMs are more abundant in the core ( Table S2 ) . Donor neutrophils accu - mulate in tumors 30 - fold less than donor macrophages and are weakly phagocytic , indicating little contribution to tumor shrinkage ( Figure S2 ) . As donor macrophages are made more phagocytic , tumor accumulation increases linearly up to (cid:1) 10 - fold ( Figures 1G , upper inset , and S2 ) . The numbers of APB and A’PB macrophages that accumulate in the tumor are similar to the numbers of resident TAMs in the absence of donor injec - tions . TAM numbers are also unaffected by tumor opsonization , consistent with minimal phagocytosis . To assess whether marrow macrophages could impact the tu - mor on their own , these cells were sorted from bulk marrow’s mature dendritic cells plus non - phagocytic cells ( e . g . , stem and progenitor cells , STAR Methods ) . SIRP a inhibition plus anti - hum Ab added to both fractions was followed by tail - vein injections into mice bearing intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) A549 tumors , which model the distal invasiveness of lung cancer [ 25 ] . To assess any effect of tumor location , the mice also had subcu - taneous A549 tumors . The dendritic cells plus non - phagocytes have no effect on tumor growth , whereas A’PB macrophage fractions cause all tumors to rapidly regress ( Figure 1H ) . Decreases in tdTom intensities in vivo by day 13 match ﬂow cy - tometry results for decreased cancer cell numbers ( Figure S2 ) , whereas pre - immune Ab on A’PB macrophage once again shows no effect ( Figure S2 ) . Macrophages Engorge and Accumulate In Vitro in 3D To assess engorge and accumulate mechanisms in which A’PB macrophages phagocytose more and thereby migrate less , Ab - coated beads of diameter 900 nm to 6 . 7 m m were pre - incubated with SIRP a inhibited macrophage for up to 150 min before transfer to 5 - m m transwells for 24 hr ( Figure 2A ; STAR Methods ) . Relative to such transwell pores , macrophages are large ( Fig - ure 1B ) : about 32 % of SIRP a - inhibited macrophages squeezed through the pores regardless of pre - incubation with unopson - ized beads that were not engulfed ( Figure 2B ) . For any bead size that was opsonized , (cid:1) 22 % of macrophages engulfed beads in the 150 min pre - incubation , and this increased (cid:1) 4 - fold after 24 hr of cell culture on top of the transwell ( Fig - ure 2C ) ; more importantly , migration was suppressed (cid:1) 10 - fold for the 900 - nm bead and nearly 100 - fold for the 6 . 7 - m m bead ( Figure 2B ) . Since only two beads or fewer were engulfed per macrophage regardless of bead size ( Figure 2D ) , phagocy - tosis of the smallest beads inhibits migration independent of steric effects . Furthermore , without the bead pre - incubation step , 5 % – 10 % fewer macrophages engulfed beads after 24 hr on the transwell , and (cid:1) 5 % more macrophages migrated A B C D E Figure 2 . Phagocytosis Inhibits 3D Migra - tion ( A ) Marrow macrophages were engineered and mixed withstreptavidinbeads of900nmto6 . 7 m m diameter or else with disaggregated tdTom A549 tumors . Beads are opsonized with anti - streptavi - din except for a non - targeted control in which SIRP a - inhibited macrophages were incubated with 2 . 1 m m lacking anti - streptavidin . These were not engulfed . After pre - incubation of the mixtures forupto150min , mixtureswereplatedfor24hron top of 5 - m m pore transwells . Cells collected from transwell tops and bottoms were stained for CD11b + , F4 / 80 + and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry for engulfment ( STAR Methods ) . ( B ) Bottom / total cell counts gives the % - migrating macrophages , with the non - opsonized control bead result at 0 ( n = 3 ) . ( C ) The % - Eating indicates internalization of at least one bead per macrophages on top of trans - wells ( or else just after the pre - incubation ) ( n = 3 ) . ( D ) The average number of opsonized beads engulfed per macrophage is (cid:1) 2 for all bead sizes ( n = 3 ) . ( E ) For engulfment of disaggregated A549 tu - mors , the negative control is disaggregated lung ( Figure S3 ) . A’PB macrophages were mixed at 10 : 1 ratio with disaggregated tumor cells or tissue cells . Nearly all A’PB macrophages become tdTom + and rarely migrate , whereas (cid:1) 50 - fold more of the same A’PB macrophages successfully migrate through the pores when incubated with control lung tissue ( n = 3 ) .

Thus , macrophages do not ‘‘eat and run’’ but rather ‘‘eat and stay . ’’ To assess whether engulfment of large , ﬂexible , and degrad - able cancer cells could likewise hinder migration of macro - phages , A549 tumors were isolated , disaggregated , and compared in in vitro phagocytosis to disaggregated lung from the same mouse ( lacking cancer cells ) . Samples were again incubated with A’PB macrophages for 24 hr on transwells . For tumor incubations , macrophages on top of a transwell show higher tdTom intensity and are larger than macrophages on bot - tom ( Figure S3 ) . Importantly , tumors inhibited all migration , whereas (cid:1) 50 % of A’PB macrophages migrated to bottom after mixing with disaggregated lung ( Figure 2E ) . Further ex vivo studies conﬁrm the higher phagocytic activity of donor macro - phage versus TAMs ( Figure S3 ) . Engorgement thus impedes 3D migration to favor accumulation . Donor Macrophages with SIRP a Inhibition and Primed Fc Receptor Shrink Tumors A’PB pre - loaded with anti - hum Ab shrink tumors in 3 days by (cid:3) 25 % and (cid:3) 15 % with anti - MUC1 , whereas A’PB pre - loaded with Cetuximab ( anti - EGFR ) and pre - immune gave + 10 % tumor growth , which is the same as untreated tumors ( Figure 3A ) . Anti - MUC1 is a mouse IgG that binds more strongly to mouse Fc re - ceptors than does humanized Cetuximab ( Figure S1 ) . Because strongly bound targeting Ab on A’PB’s is internalized during phagocytosis ( Figures 1B and S2 ) , tail - vein injections of targeting Ab began after day 3 . Untreated and pre - immune treated tumors grew + 15 % – 30 % larger by day 10 while treated tumors continued to shrink to (cid:3) 50 % with anti - hum , (cid:3) 38 % with anti - MUC1 , and (cid:3) 15 % with Cetuximab . Binding of Cetuximab to A549 cells proves surprisingly strong after systemic injection ( Figure S1 ) , which provides for successful opsonization . Without SIRP a inhibition , tail - vein - injected donor cells plus systemic anti - hum Ab impede tumor growth ( Figures 3B and S2 ) , but tumors regress dramatically with injection of APB mac - rophages : tumor size and tdTom intensity decrease to (cid:3) 50 % of initial size by day 10 ( Figures 3B , right half of plots , and S2 ) . Tu - mors treated with donor cells and only pre - immune Ab continue to grow at untreated rates . Anti - SIRP a thus synergizes with Ab opsonization in tumor regression . TAMs Can Only Shrink CD47 Knockdown Tumors TAMs are phagocytic primarily toward CD47 - KD tumors ( Figures 1D and 1E ) , with regression dependent on anti - hum Ab dose ( Figure S4 ) . Selective engulfment of KD cells was evident within mosaic tumors having (cid:1) 2 : 1 KD : GFP - control cells ( shCtl ) ( Fig - ure S4 ; Table S3 ) . Without treatment , no signiﬁcant difference in tumor growth rate was observed between Mosaic , wild - type ( WT ) / shCtl , and CD47 - KD tumors for moderate knockdown ( Fig - ures 3C and S4 ) , although deep knockdown increased tumor growth ( Figure S4 ) . The result hints at re - programming [ 26 ] and potential adverse effects with knockdown therapies [ 12 ] . Tail - vein injection of anti - hum Ab caused regression of mosaic tumors , with ( treated / untreated ) = ( 0 . 7 / 1 . 5 ) = 0 . 48 at day 18 . Analysis of tumors by ﬂow cytometry agrees quantitatively with in vivo imaging results : for every three cancer cells in untreated tumors , only (cid:1) 1 . 4 are present after treatment , which again gives ( treated / untreated ) = ( 1 . 4 / 3 . 0 ) = 0 . 48 . Cancer cells with low CD47 are thus selectively engulfed . Calreticulin opsonization of cancer cells has been proposed as contributing to macrophage - driven tumor shrinkage upon CD47 inhibition ( e . g . , [ 27 – 29 ] ) . Targeting Abs bind via their Fc domains to Fc receptors ( Figure S1 ) and thereby activate phagocytosis . To assess this likely pathway , the anti - hum Ab was cleaved to F ( ab’ ) 2 without affecting the afﬁnity for cancer cells ( Fig - ure 3D , inset ) . Importantly , neither F ( ab’ ) 2 nor the pre - immune Ab affected growth of CD47 KD tumors ( Figure 3D ) . The results are consistent with a key role for Fc - receptor activation . Engorge and Accumulate as a Mechanism for Tumor Regression A ‘‘cumulative phagocytosis index’’ is deﬁned for each macro - phage preparation by multiplying the percentage of tdTom + macrophages in tumors ( Figures 1E and 1F ) by the number of macrophages in the tumor ( Figure 1G ) and the number of cancer cells engulfed per macrophage ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . The number of tdTom A549 cells ( per 10 5 total cells ) that remain in the tumor decreases with cumulative phagocytosis ( Figure 3E ) : untreated tumors have (cid:1) 40 % cancer cells ( Figure 3E , left scat - terplot ) , which decreases (cid:1) 100 - fold with A’PB macrophage treatment ( Figure 3E , right scatterplot ) . Such selective clearance of the tdTom cancer cells matches mosaic tumor results ( Fig - ure 3C ) . Tumor regression rate also increases with cumulative phagocytosis when determined for all of the different macro - phage types injected into mice with tumors ( Figure 3F ) . TAM - dependent treatments are all in the lower half of this efﬁcacy plot . To begin to clarify some of the differences between donor macrophages and recipient TAMs , tumor macrophages isolated 3 hr after treatment were stained for the M1 - marker major histo - compatibility complex II , MHC - II , as a ‘‘phagocytic phenotype’’ [ 30 ] , and for the M2 - marker mannose receptor ( MRC1 , CD206 ) indicating a relatively non - phagocytic phenotype [ 31 ] . Recipient TAMs that were tdTom – showed a comparatively low M1 / M2 ra - tio as did macrophages in spleen or liver , whereas recipient TAMs that had engulfed cancer cells showed a higher M1 / M2 ra - tio ( Table S4 ) , consistent with CD47 - blockade causing TAMs to polarize toward M1 phenotypes [ 32 ] . Fresh marrow - derived macrophages as well as tumor - extracted donor , and APB mac - rophages always showed the highest M1 / M2 ratio . ( D ) Regressionof CD47 KD + tumors occurs with intact anti - hum IgG ( FigureS4 ) but not withanti - hum F ( ab’2 ) ( n R 3 mice / group ) .

Although just a few macrophage surface markers were used for sorting , marrow and spleen macrophages still cluster with published proﬁles ( Table S5 ) . Hier - archical clustering shows engineered donor macrophages after 2 – 3 days in tumors align with TAMs rather than marrow macro - phages ( Figure 4B ) . Importantly , Sirpa increases 8 - fold with decreasing phagocytic phenotype : Sirpa is lowest on fresh marrow macrophages and highest on TAMs , whereas engi - neered macrophages in tumors had intermediate Sirpa similar to splenic macrophages ( Figure 4C ) . Cd47 varies little between the different macrophages . For protein , ﬂow cytometry for mSIRP a conﬁrmed the transcript trends for marrow < spleen < TAMs and for mCD47 ( Figure 4D ) , whereas mSIRP a protein on day 3 donor macrophages increased slightly from marrow ( Fig - ure S5 ) . High mSIRP a will tend to increase the sensitivity to cells expressing even low levels of CD47 and will therefore tend to pacify macrophages , just as inhibiting SIRP a ( or knocking down CD47 ) does the opposite in favoring phagocytosis . The increased mSIRP a on donor macrophages relative to marrow macrophages also equals or exceeds the dissociation of anti - SIRP a in the tumor ( Figures S1 and S5 ) . These data do not estab - lish a causal relationship between increased SIRP a and macro - phage differentiation into TAMs , but it is interesting that M2 markers and SIRP a increase concurrently . Dendritic cell markers Cd135 and Cd86 are also low in marrow macrophages ( consis - tent with (cid:1) 1 dendritic cell per 50 macrophages in marrow ) and remain low after donor accumulation in tumors ( Table S5 ) . Consistent with a distinct state , marrow macrophages exhibit higher Hoechst staining than TAMs ( Figure 4D ) . Alignment of RNA - seq data with human transcriptomes ( rather than mouse ) shows human - RNA is most abundant in engineered macrophages taken from tumors , consistent with phagocytosis of human cancer cells ( Figure 4E ) . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst time that RNA from such engulfed targets has been separated from macrophage RNA and suggests that macro - phage proﬁling ( e . g . , [ 24 ] ) is more complex than assumed . For the fresh marrow and spleen macrophages , a mouse : human alignment ratio of (cid:1) 8 : 1 inverts to (cid:1) 1 : 7 for engineered macro - phages in tumors . Macrophage markers are dominated by mouse sequence reads in all samples , but epithelial markers ( E - cadherin , keratin - 18 ) are human and detected only in tumor macrophages . The results provide additional and novel evidence of cancer cell engulfment . Microenvironments of solid tumors are highly collagenous and distinct from soft , matrix - deﬁcient marrow [ 33 ] . Differentiation might therefore be expected for marrow - derived macrophages that engorge on cancer cells and accumulate in solid tumors . Among transcripts that increase most are those for collagen - 1 ( Col1a1 and Col1a2 ; Figure 4E ) , which is a heterotrimer that self - assembles into ﬁbers that determine the solidity of tissue [ 18 ] . Matrix stiffness generally alters cell phenotype [ 18 , 19 ] and can affect phagocytosis [ 17 ] , with one intriguing mechanosensor being the nuclear structure protein lamin - A [ 18 ] . Lmna is indeed highest in donor macrophages from the solid tumors here ( Fig - ure 4E ) . Combining results with those of others from diverse tis - sues [ 24 ] reveals a consistent increase in Lmna versus tissue or tumor solidity measured as micro - stiffness ( Figure S5 ) . Lamin - B isoforms are relatively constant compared to the increased collagenwithtissuesolidity [ 18 ] . Importantly , theratio Sirpa : Cd47 also increases with tissue or tumor stiffness ( Figure 5A ) . For human - derived THP1 macrophages adhering in vitro to collagen - coated gels that are either soft like marrow or much stiffer like solid tumors , lamin - A and SIRP a proteins both increase ( Figures 5B , 5C , and S5 ) . The two are likely linked because lamin - A contributes to regulation of the retinoid pathway that also modulates SIRP a ( Figure S5 ) , as reviewed recently [ 14 ] . Such regulation of SIRP a has functional implica - tions because small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) knockdown of hSIRP a increase engulfment of opsonized A549 cancer cells in vitro just as effectively as anti - hSIRP a inhibition or CD47 inhi - bition directly on these cancer cells ( Figure S5 ) . The anti - hSIRP a SE7C2 clone is also notably distinct from the anti - mSIRP a P84 clone used on mouse - derived macrophages ( Figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 ) , which underscores the generality of SIRP a inhibition . Human Macrophages Engorge on Human Tumors , with Plateaus in Regression Indicating Differentiation A plateau in tumor shrinkage for both subcutaneous and i . p . tu - mors from day 9 to day 13 ( Figure S2 ) suggested differentiation of donor macrophages or perhaps tumor resistance ( e . g . , loss of epitopes ) . In studies over 1 – 2 months , injection of anti - hum Ab plus APB macrophages caused 20 % regression by day 3 ( Figure 6 ) , which reached 40 % by day 10 but then a plateau up to day 14 despite continuous Ab injections . Untreated tumors exhibit linear growth in terms of both projected area and tdTom intensity , and pre - immune Ab on APB macrophages showed no effect . A second injection of targeted APB macrophages on day 14 decreased tumor size and tdTom intensity ( Figure 6 ) . Figure 4 .

( D ) Relative protein levels of SIRPA and CD47 from ﬂow cytometry show similar trends as RNA measurements ( Figure S5 ; n = 2 mice ) . ( E ) RNA - seq shows donor macrophage in tumor differ from marrow macrophage and that human - RNA is most abundant in donor macrophages , consistent with phagocytosis . Top rows shows total numbers of sequence reads from each sample that align to mouse or human genomes ( Table S5 ) . Macrophage markers show high mouse alignment and low human alignment . Epithelial makers : only macrophages in the tumor show high mRNA reads for human E - cadherin and keratin , and donor macrophages contain the highest . Matrix to nucleus pathway : only macrophages in the tumor show high mRNA reads for mouse matrix and mechanosensitive cytoskeleton ( Acta2 , smooth muscle actin ) and nucleus ( lamin - A ) . 2072 Current Biology 27 , 2065 – 2077 , July 24 , 2017 Systemic injections of anti - hum Ab stopped at day 24 , and tumor regression stopped ( eventually re - growing , Figure S4 ) until a cell treatment at day 35 that re - initiated regression . Plateaus thus suggest a loss of donor macrophage function . Human marrow macrophages from a diverse pool of donors ( Figure 7A ) were engineered with a human - speciﬁc anti - hSIRP a ( Figure 7B ) to test the generality of engorge , accumulate , and differentiate processes . Tumors regressed within days of human - APB or A’PB macrophage injections into tail veins ( (cid:1) 12 M cells ) , decreasing tumor size by (cid:1) 40 % within the ﬁrst week ( Figure 7B ) . Human donor A’PBs thus shrink tumors similar to mouse donors ( Figure 6 ) . No signiﬁcant effects resulted from pre - immune Ab combined with either human APB macrophages or donor macrophages lacking anti - hSIRP a ( Figure 7B ) . How - ever , human donor macrophages with twice - per - week anti - hum Ab ( but without SIRP a inhibition ) did shrink tumors approx - imately half as well as A’PB macrophages before the commonly seen plateau at approximately day 15 ( Figure 7B ) . This important ﬁnding indicates macrophage differentiation is independent of the presence of anti - hSIRP a . Flow cytometry analyses of the CD14 + CD33 + CD66b – human macrophages isolated from tu - mors show the large human macrophages engulf approximately two to three human cancer cells ( Figure S6 ) , which exceeds the (cid:1) 1 : 1 result for mouse macrophages ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . The observation indicates more human engorgement of more human cancer cells to cause greater tumor regression . No signiﬁcant tumor growth was measured up to day 55 , although tumors eventually re - grew at untreated rates ( Figures 7B and S4 ) . Importantly , regression by at least (cid:1) 80 % could be A B C Figure 5 .

Mice were given biweekly Ab treatment and donor marrow ( (cid:1) 10 M cells ) on days 0 , 14 , and 35 . Mice in pre - immune treatment group were switched to full treatment group on day 14 ( n = 4 – 8 mice / group ) . ( inset ) Tumor imaging on treatment day 28 after two full donor marrow treatment cycles . Red regions are tdTom signal acquired from tumors . Two mice ( left ) were treated with APB macro - phages , and the other two mice ( right ) were untreated . Error bars represent mean + SEM . Current Biology 27 , 2065 – 2077 , July 24 , 2017 2073 re - initiated simply by injection of more human donor cells . This again indicates limits of macrophage differentiation rather than tumor evolution . Furthermore , CD47 - KD tumors treated with human macrophages and anti - hum Ab regressed at the same rate as A’PB macrophage injections , which again equates SIRP a inhibition with CD47 inhibition ( Figure S6 ) . Engineered human macrophages also drive regression of CD47 - KD tumors ( at 12 % per day ) far more effectively than TAMs ( just 2 % per day ) . Blood Proﬁles Remain Normal with Engineered Marrow Treatments of Tumors Safety is a concern whenever inhibiting macrophage recognition of ‘‘self’’ based on past ﬁndings that systemic injection of anti - CD47 rapidly clears blood cells [ 8 , 34 ] and that Cd47 - knockout mice ( NOD strain ) exhibit auto - immunity , anemia , and premature death [ 35 ] . Blood from the various mice before and after macro - phage injections show that RBC count , hemoglobin levels , % - hematocrit , platelet count , and white blood cell ( WBC ) count all remained within the normal range for all treated mice over the many weeks of study ( Figures 7C and S6 ) . For all mice , a slight upward increase in WBC count could reﬂect inﬂammation that is associated with retro - orbital bleeds [ 36 ] . However , no anoma - lous mouse behavior or graft versus host disease ( GvHD ) symp - toms were observed in any mouse treated with engineered hu - man or mouse marrow after multiple injections of each over 30 + days of experimentation in dozens of mice ( STAR Methods ) . Intravenous injection of engineered donor macrophages thus appears safe as well as effective . DISCUSSION Marrow macrophages in tumors can be far more phagocytic than TAMs ( Figure 1D ) , which is a useful ﬁrst ingredient for tumor C A B Figure 7 . Human A’PB or APB Macrophages Cause Rapid Shrinkage of Subcutaneous Tumors and Are Safe after Single and Multiple Injections ( A ) Human marrow donor variation ( information in STAR Methods ) .

Second , CD47 - SIRP a self - recognition should be in - hibited , and high - afﬁnity anti - SIRP a Abs clearly work well in vivo . Third , the tumor cell should be speciﬁcally opsonized as illus - trated here with both pre - loaded targeting Abs and with systemic injections . Anti - CD47 has been proposed to both inhibit ‘‘self’’ signaling and to efﬁciently opsonize a cancer cell [ 8 ] , but replica - tion of efﬁcacy against tumors and statistical signiﬁcance have been questioned [ 13 ] . Compared to the anti - MUC1 doses used in the present study , clinical trials show R 10 - fold higher doses are ineffective against tumors [ 21 ] , but of course TAMs are not phagocytic without some type of CD47 - SIRP a blockade ( Figures 1D – 1F and 3C – 3F ) . Cetuximab injections at 50 - fold higher doses than used here can delay the growth of A549 tumors but not drive regression [ 37 ] , whereas paclitaxel treatments of A549 tumors cause regression ( (cid:3) 25 % by day 10 ) before drug - resistance emerges [ 38 ] , which is not evident with the similarly effective donor macrophage injections here ( Figures 6 and 7 ) . Phagocytes are often considered highly motile , but inhibition of cell migration by engulfment likely explains accumulation in the tumor . Solid tumors are well known for their poor perme - ability to drugs , i . e . , low porosity , and macrophage immobiliza - tion can in part be due to an inability to ‘‘eat and run , ’’ with similar antagonism already known between endocytic and migratory pathways for Dyctiostilium amoeba [ 39 ] and dendritic cells [ 40 ] . Nuclear lamins set nuclear stiffness , and a cell with high lamin levels ( Figure 5C ) is impeded in 3D migration [ 41 , 42 ] with similar effects expected after engulfment of another cell ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . Safety was evident here with no detectable impact on mouse health from the cell plus Ab injections that drive tumor phagocy - tosis and regression ( Figures 7C and S6 ) . In comparison , sys - temic injection of anti - CD47 causes large decreases in blood cells and platelets [ 8 , 13 , 34 ] . Because of CD47’s ubiquitous expression , CD47 blockade in clinical trials will likely promote off - target phagocytosis with auto - immunity risks [ 35 ] , and com - binations with tumor - speciﬁc opsonizing Abs will likely engage only a small subset of TAMs ( Figure 1F ) . TAM engulfment of CD47 - low cancer cells ( Figures 3C , 3D , and S4 ) is consistent nonetheless with patients tending to have CD47 - high tumors [ 8 ] . Tumor microenvironment properties including stiffness likely contribute to progressive differentiation of donor macrophages , with upregulation of SIRP a ( Figures 4B – 4E , 5A , 5B , and S5 ) . Higher SIRPA provides more opportunity to recognize tumor - CD47 . Although RNAi knockdown of SIRP a can increase phago - cytosis in vitro ( Figure S5 ) , SIRP a - knockdown macrophages can promote tumor growth in vivo [ 43 ] . Suppression of tumor phago - cytosis by donor macrophage differentiation is consistent with ( 1 ) simultaneous increases in SIRP a and the M2 surface marker ( Figures 4 and 5C ; Table S4 ) and also with ( 2 ) additional injec - tions of donor macrophages proving effective as well as safe ( Figures 7C and S6 ) . Repeated injections are not only clinically relevant [ 44 ] , but scaling up the (cid:1) 4 – 12 M injected cells from mouse to human body weight shows these macrophage numbers are close to the (cid:1) 10 9 human macrophages that have already been safely infused into cancer patients , though without beneﬁt [ 6 ] . To our knowledge , the present study provides the ﬁrst in vivo demonstration that even two injections of human marrow macrophages can drive regression—by (cid:1) 80 % or more—of large , human solid tumors .

Discher ( discher @ seas . upenn . edu ) . EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Human Specimens Fresh human bone marrow was purchased from AllCells ( Cat # : ABM001 - 1 ) in 3 mL quantities from healthy donors . AllCells received IRB approval from Alpha ( Protocol # 7000 - SOP - 046 ) which includes donor consent . In total , there were 4 different donors . Donors were all anonymous to the authors of this study , and experiments were all conducted at the University of Pennsylvania with IRB approval ( Protocol # 808191 ) from review board IRB # 7 . Subject 1 : Female age 30 , subject 2 : Female age 31 , subject 3 : Male age 31 , subject 4 : Male age 22 with additional details provided by AllCells per ( Figure 7A ) . Marrow was pooled and divided among the different experimental conditions in Figure 7 . Murine Specimens NSG male and female mice > 6 weeks old were purchased from either The Jackson Laboratory or from the Stem Cell and Xenograft Core at the University of Pennsylvania under IACUC approved protocols ( # 805977 and # 804455 ) which adhere to all regulatory stan - dards . Blood , lung , liver , spleen , and marrow were obtained from these mice following the same IACUC approved protocols . The health of mice was assessed prior to the start of each experiment by dedicated veterinary technician and was not used if unhealthy . Mice were never used for more than one experiment . Mice are housed in a NOD . SCID dedicated BSL - 2 animal barrier space equip - ped for all necessary procedures at the University of Pennsylvania Stem Cell and Xenograft Core . Cell Lines ATCC ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA , USA ) is a biological materials resource and standards organization with external accreditation from the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , and ATCC provides cell line authentication test recommendations per Tech Bulletin number 8 ( TB - 0111 - 00 - 02 ; year . 2010 ) . This bulletin recommends ﬁve types of tests ( under - lined ) for the authentication of cell lines . Cell morphology check by microscopy , growth curve analysis , and mycoplasma detection by DNA staining ( for ﬁlaments or extracellular particulates ) were conducted on all cell lines used in these studies , and all cell lines main - tained the expected morphology and standard growth rates with no mycoplasma detected . Two additional , ATCC - recommended authentication tests were conducted on the A549 cell line as the A549 cells were used in all of the main and supplemental ﬁgures . Species veriﬁcation of A549 cells as human by RNA sequencing detection of uniquely human sequence ( Figure 4 ) , by mass spec - trometry detection of uniquely human sequence ( Figure S1 ) , and by antibody targeting with anti - human Abs ( Figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and S1 – S6 ) . Identity veriﬁcation from DNA of A549 was conﬁrmed using SNP arrays ( SNPa ) . DNA was isolated by using the Blood and Cell Culture DNA Mini Kit ( QIAGEN ) per the manufacturer’s instructions , and DNA samples were sent to The Center for Applied Genomics Core in The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia for the SNPa HumanOmniExpress - 24 Bead Chip Kit ( Illumina ) , with > 700 , 000 probes along the entire human genome . For each sample , the Genomics Core provided the data in the form of GenomeStudio ﬁles ( Illumina ) . Chromosome copy number was analyzed in GenomeStudio with the cnvPartition plugin ( Illumina ) . SNP array experiments also provide genotype data , which was used to give SNV data . Genotyping in this Illumina system relies on the correlation between total intensity and intensity ratio of the two probes , one for CG and another for AT . These correlations were mapped to a standard clustering ﬁle ( Illumina ) to give the SNP calls . Consistent with ATCC ‘s karyotype analysis , SNPa show the A549 cells are hypotriploid with a chromosome copy number of 66 , including 2 copies of X and Y chromosomes and 4 copies of chromosome 17 . Further consistent with ATCC’s descriptions of this cell line as Caucasian in origin , SNPa analyses Continued REAGENT OR RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER Mesenchymal Stem Cells Progeria Research Foundation N / A Human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HepG2 ) ATCC HB - 8065 Mouse myoblast ( C2C12 ) ATCC CRL - 1772 Software MaxQuant Version 1 . 5 . 3 . 8 Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry http : / / www . biochem . mpg . de / 5111795 / maxquant Living Image Perkin Elmer http : / / www . perkinelmer . com / product / spectrum - 200 - living - image - v4series - 1 - 128113 ImageJ NIH https : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / Current Biology 27 , 2065 – 2077 . e1 – e6 , July 24 , 2017 e2 show that the A549 cells are mostly European in ancestry ( (cid:1) 90 % ) ( Dodecad2 . 1 an ancestry lineage algorithm that has used mostly Illumina SNPa data ) . METHOD DETAILS Experimental Design All experiments were replicated . Measurements and analysis , when applicable , were conducted blindly with stratiﬁed sampling . In the case of tumor growth and regression studies , mice were not stratiﬁed , but separated by tumor size to ensure all groups had the same average tumor size at the start of treatment . No data were excluded from any dataset . F ( ab’ ) 2 Production Anti - hum F ( ab’ ) 2 were produced using a Thermo Scientiﬁc Pierce F ( ab’ ) 2 Preparation Kit . Brieﬂy , immobilized pepsin was used to cleave full - length anti - hum antibody . After a 3 hr incubation , the pepsin was removed by centrifugation at 5000 g for 1 min . A SDS - PAGE was then used to assess complete digestion . Following successful cleavage , Fc fragments were removed via an Amicon Ultra centrifugal ﬁlter device with a 50 , 000 - molecular weight cut - off . F ( ab’2 ) product from above was centrifuged in a ﬁlter at 5000 g for 30 min . After centrifugation , F ( ab’ ) 2 was collected , and the ﬁlter membrane was washed with PBS . To verify that Fc fragments had been removed , the recovered F ( ab’ ) 2 was run on a SDS - PAGE along with the ﬁltrate . Mass Spectrometry to Determine Anti - Human Antigens Mass spectrometry ( MS ) samples were prepared using the same procedures outlined in [ 18 ] . Brieﬂy , (cid:1) 1 mm 3 gel sections were excised from SDS – PAGE gels and were washed in 50 % 0 . 2 M ammonium bicarbonate ( AB ) , 50 % acetonitrile ( ACN ) solution for 30 min at 37 (cid:4) C . The washed slices were lyophilized , incubated with a reducing agent [ 20 mM TCEP in 25 mM AB solution ] , and alkylated [ 40 mM iodoacetamide ( IAM ) in 25 mM AB solution ] . The gel sections were lyophilized again before in - gel trypsinization [ 20 mg / mL sequencing grade modiﬁed trypsin , Promega ] for 18 hr at 37 (cid:4) C with gentle shaking . The resulting tryptic peptides were extracted by adding 50 % digest dilution buffer ( 60 mM AB solution with 3 % formic acid ) and injected into a high - pressure liquid chro - matography system coupled to a hybrid LTQ - Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) via a nano - electrospray ion source . Raw data from each MS sample was processed using MaxQuant ( version 1 . 5 . 3 . 8 , Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry ) . MaxQuant’s built - in Label - Free Quantiﬁcation ( LFQ ) algorithm was employed with full tryptic digestion and up to 2 missed cleavage sites . Peptides were searched against a FASTA database compiled from UniRef100 ( June 2011 ) human , plus mouse and contam - inants . The software’s decoy search mode was set as ‘revert’ and a MS / MS tolerance limit of 20 ppm was used , along with a false discovery rate ( FDR ) of 1 % . The minimum number of amino acid residues per tryptic peptide was set to 7 , and MaxQuant’s ‘match between runs’ feature was used for transfer of peak identiﬁcations across samples . All other parameters were run under default set - tings . The MaxQuant output tables were then fed into its custom bioinformatics suite , Perseus ( version 1 . 5 . 2 . 4 ) , for protein annotation and sorting . Development of THP - 1 SIRP a - KD Cell Lines Stable SIRP a - KD cell lines were established using a standard transduction protocol , as described above . Brieﬂy , human SIRP a shRNA lentiviral transduction plasmids were purchased from Santa Cruz ( sc - 44106 - SH ) . Plasmid was transfected into bacteria , al - lowed to replicate , and then harvested using a maxi plasmid isolation kit . Plasmid was sent to Wistar Institute to produce active len - tiviral particles . THP - 1 cells were transduced with viral particles , and stable clones were generated by puromycin selection . The SIRP a knockdown efﬁciency was determined by antibody staining and ﬂow cytometry . Phagocytosis Assay THP - 1 s were incubated in RPMI medium with 100 ng / mL phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) for 2 days . Where anti - hSIRP a antibody was used , macrophages were pre - incubated at 5 . 32 nM at 37 (cid:4) C for 1 hr prior to the addition of A549 cells . All conditions were sup - plemented with non - speciﬁc IgG ( (cid:1) 30ug / mL ) from FBS . A549s were prepared as follows : the cells were ﬁrst removed using cell dissociation buffer Hanks ( Invitrogen ) , and then incubated with anti - hum and B6H12 antibodies at 1 m M and 83 nM , respectively . The A549s were then combined with the THP - 1 s at a ratio of 5 to 1 ; this mixture was incubated for 75 min at 37 (cid:4) C , and then rinsed with PBS . Three - minute trypsin incubation was used to remove non - ingested A549s . The remaining cells were scraped off the plate and stained with CD11b ( label THP - 1 s ) and anti - rabbit - AF488 antibody ( to distinguish non - ingested A549s ) . The cells were washed two times with PBS and resuspended in 5 % FBS / PBS before being analyzed by a BD LSRII cytometer . Phagocytosis of human red blood cells followed the same protocol as described in [ 45 ] . Brieﬂy , RBC were opsonized with anti - hum and CD47 blocked with 0 to 270 nM anti - CD47 ( B6H12 ) . After shaking ( Argos RotoFlex , 45 min , room temperature ) , RBCs were pelleted and labeled with PKH26 dye ( room temperature , 30 min ) . RBCs were added to THP - 1 and incubated for 30 min . After , RBCs were lysed and THP - 1 were removed with Trypsin followed by staining ( 10 min with Hoechst 33342 ) . e3 Current Biology 27 , 2065 – 2077 . e1 – e6 , July 24 , 2017 Immunoﬂuorescence A549 cells were seeded on 18 mm circular microscope coverslips in a 6 - well plate and allowed to adhere overnight . Cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature ( RT ) , and then washed three times with PBS . Next , cells were blocked for 30 min using 3 % BSA + 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 , followed by a 2 hr RT primary antibody incubation in blocking buffer . These primary an - tibodies were used at a 1 : 100 concentration . After incubation , cells were again washed three times with PBS . A 1 : 400 PBS dilution of donkey secondary antibodies ( Alexa Fluor 488 and 647 ) was added for 1 hr at RT . Hoechst 33342—at a concentration of 1 m g / mL— was used to stain DNA for 15 min at RT . Coverslips were washed a ﬁnal three times with PBS before being mounted on slides with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent ( Life Technologies ) , cured for 24 hr , and sealed with nail polish prior to imaging . Images were ac - quired by an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope with a 300W Xenon lamp illumination using 40 3 , 60 3 , or 150 3 objectives with or without 1 . 6 3 magniﬁcation . Image analysis was done in ImageJ ( NIH ) . Flow Cytometry of In Vitro Cultured Cells A549 cells were dissociated using 10 mM trypsin in PBS , washed , and re - suspended in 2 % FBS in PBS . Antibody incubation was done at RT for 1 hr , followed by washing and resuspension in 2 % FBS . Samples were run on a BD LSRII . Confocal Imaging For confocal imaging and ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments , an inverted laser scanning confocal mi - croscope ( SP8 , Leica ) was used , with a 63 3 / 1 . 4NA oil immersion objective ( Leica ) . FRAP time - lapse imaging was acquired at 37 (cid:4) C with 5 % CO 2 in a humidiﬁed chamber for up to 10 min after photobleaching . Meanwhile , samples were cultured in phenol - red free complete DMEM medium . Image sequences were analyzed using ImageJ . Establishment of A549 Tumors In Vivo CD47 knockdown and wild - type A549s were dissociated from tissue culture ﬂasks using 10 mM trypsin in PBS . For each injection , 10 6 ro 2x10 6 cells were suspended in 100 m L ice - cold PBS and 25 % Matrigel ( BD ) and injected subcutaneously into the ﬂank or intra - peritoneal of non - obese diabetic / severe combined immunodeﬁcient ( NOD / SCID ) mice with null expression of interleukin - 2 receptor gamma chain ( NSG mice ) . Treatment groups were a mix of male and female mice . Mice were obtained from the University of Penn - sylvania Stem Cell and Xenograft Core or Jackson Laboratory . All animal experiments were planned and performed according to IACUC protocols . In Vivo Tumor Imaging Mice were anesthetized via inhalation of isoﬂurane at 3 L / min and maintained at 1 . 5 L / min . Images were acquired using a Perkin Elmer IVIS Spectrum with excitation and emission ﬁlters set at 535 nm and 580 nm , respectively , optimized for tdTom imaging . Images of each face of the sagittal plane were taken to capture both left and right ﬂanks . Mouse fur was soaked with ethanol to reduce auto ﬂuorescence prior to imaging . Three ﬂuorescent standards were used to subtract background ﬂuorescence and calibrate IVIS Im - ages were analyzed in ImageJ , where the length and width of the tdTom tumor was measured . Analysis of tdTom intensity was done using Living Image ( Perkin Elmer ) , which involved spectral unmixing of 10 - 13 images to sufﬁciently remove any tdTom auto - ﬂuorescence from the mice . Adoptive Transfer of NSG Bone Marrow Femurs and tibias of donor NSG were removed , and bone marrow was ﬂushed with 5 % FBS / PBS . Red cells were lysed by incubation with RBC lysis buffer ( Sigma ) in 4 % FBS / PBS for 12 min at RT . Cells were washed twice and resuspended in warm 5 % FBS / PBS . Following the addition of 1 : 1000 CFDA - SE ( Invitrogen ) , cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 (cid:4) C , and then centrifuged again , resus - pended in warm complete DMEM medium , and incubated for an additional 30 - 40 min at 37 (cid:4) C . When applicable , anti - mSIRP a anti - body was added during this incubation period . Cells were then washed , resuspended in 5 % FBS / PBS , counted , and volume adjusted to allow injection of 10 6 cells . Remaining cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry to establish initial composition . Antibody Treatment Mice were warmed under a heat lamp prior to tail vein injection . Opsonization of human cells was done with anti - human antibody ( anti - hum , rabbit polyclonal IgG made against human RBCs , Rockland , 109 - 4139 ) . Anti - hum antibody has been found to bind to the following human cell types : A549 ( Fig . S1 ) , RBC ( Fig . S1 ) , Huh7 , and HepG2 . However , it does not bind to any mouse cell type tested : RBC ( Fig . S1 ) , EC4 ( Fig . S1 ) , and C2C12 . Furthermore , mouse blood cells do not deplete following repeated systemic injection of 600 m g of anti - hum ( Figures 6D and S6 ) . Anti - hum Ab and serum puriﬁed rabbit IgG ( Sigma , pre - immune ) were reconstituted per manufacturer’s direction and further diluted using sterile PBS . Mice were injected with anti - hum 600 m g per animal ( (cid:1) 20 mg / kg ) twice a week . Mouse anti - human Mucin 1 ( MA5 - 15131 , ThermoFisher ) and cetuximab ( InVivogen ) were administered twice a week at 10 m g each per mouse . Engineered Human Marrow Fresh human bone marrow ( ABM001 - 1 , AllCells ) was incubated with 3 mL of red blood cell lysing buffer hybrid - Max ( R7757 , Sigma ) for 12 min in a 15mL conical tube . Cells were then centrifuged at 2 , 000 rpm for 2 . 5 min , the lysate was removed , and the remaining Current Biology 27 , 2065 – 2077 . e1 – e6 , July 24 , 2017 e4 cells were suspended in 3 mL of red blood cell lysis buffer for a second 12 min lysis phase . After another 2 , 000 rpm , 2 . 5 min centri - fugation , cells were resuspended in 500 m L of PBS with 1 m L of 10 mM CFDA SE solution ( prepared per kit instructions ) . Cells were incubated for 40 min at 37 (cid:4) C and inverted 2 - 3 times every 5 min . After this incubation period , SIRP a - inhibiting and Fc - priming anti - human antibodies ( 109 - 4139 , Rockland ) were added to cells at 4 m g / mL and 100 m g / mL concentrations , respectively . Then , cells were twice centrifuged at 2 , 000 rpm for 2 . 5 min : the ﬁrst time , they were resuspended in 1 mL of 5 % FBS / PBS , and the second time , in 100 m L of 5 % FBS / PBS . A cell count was performed using a hemocytometer , and cells were diluted to 40 , 000 cells per m L ( 8 3 10 6 cells total per mouse ) for intravenous tail vein injection in tumor bearing mice . Mice that were treated with unprimed cells were injected intravenously with 600 m g ( 6 m g / m L ) of human red blood cell antibody ( Rockland ) 4 - 6 hr prior to injection of engineered marrow cells . Ex Vivo Tumor Flow Cytometry Analysis On the day of analysis , mice in the treatment cohort were injected with the standard antibody dose , as described above . Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation 1 . 5 - 2 hr after injection . Tumors and spleens were removed and placed in 20 % FBS , and tumor core and periphery tissue were segregated . Tumor tissue was cut into 1 - 3 mm pieces , transferred to 15 mL centrifuge tubes , and centri - fuged to remove media . Tissue was then resuspended in 3 mL warm Dispase ( STEMCELL Technologies ) supplemented with 3 mg / mL Collagenase ( Sigma ) and 200 m L of 1 mg / mL DNase I ( Roche ) . Samples were mixed by pipetting for 1 - 3 min until cloudy but not stringy . Dissociation was quenched by addition of 10 mL room temperature PBS , and then the suspension was ﬁltered through a 70 m m cell strainer . The ﬁltrate was centrifuged , the supernatant discarded , and the pellet resuspended in 2 % FBS for anti - body incubation . Spleens were prepared by mechanical dissociation , ﬁltration , and red blood cell lysis using Red Cell Lysing Buffer ( Sigma ) . Lysed samples were washed and resuspended in 2 % FBS for antibody incubation . Prior to antibody incubation , samples were blocked with 1 : 500 Fc Block ( BD PharMingen ) for at least 5 min at RT . CD47 - AF647 ( 1 : 25 ) , donkey anti - rabbit AF488 or AF700 ( 1 : 400 ) , donkey anti - rat AF647 ( 1 : 400 ) , F4 / 80 APC - Cy7 ( 3 : 50 ) , CD11b PE - Cy7 ( 1 : 25 ) , Gr - 1 APC ( 1 : 25 ) , hCD47 AF647 ( 1 . 5 : 50 ) , and Hoescht 33342 ( 1 : 1250 ) were incubated at RT for 1 hr . Cells were then washed and resuspended in 2 % FBS . Analysis of Mouse Blood Proﬁles 100 m L of blood was isolated from anesthetized mice by retro - orbital bleeds . Blood was collected in Eppendorf tubes containing EDTA . Blood was kept at room temperature and immediately analyzed using a Drew Scientiﬁc Hemovet ( HV950 ) . Graft versus Host Disease Mice were monitored 3 times a week by researchers and veterinarian technicians at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine mouse facilities for general health and for development of GvHD . Classic signs of GvHD include weight loss ( > 15 % ) , rufﬂed fur , loss of fur on the head and rear of the mouse , hunch posture , and reduced activity [ 46 , 47 ] . Development of GvHD is a common occurrence at these facilities as numerous users study CAR T cell therapies , which frequently cause GvHD [ 48 ] . Sorting of Marrow Cells In some experiments , marrow phagocytes were sorted from non - phagocytes and dendritic cells . FACS Aria ( Biosciences ) was used to sort 60 million marrow cells using anti - CD135 - BV421 ( Biosciences [ 49 ] , ) and anti - SIRP a – FITC ( P84 , Biosciences ) into 15 mL conical tubes containing 1mL FBS . This sorting process generated 20 tubes , which were subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 4 , 000 rpm . After the supernatant was aspirated , cells were resuspended in 5 % FBS / PBS , incubated with targeting antibody for 1 hr , and centrifuged again . Finally , cells were resuspended in 200 m L of 5 % FBS / PBS per 10 3 10 6 cells and put on ice for tail - vein injection . 3D Migration Assay Migration assays were performed using 24 - well inserts with 3 m m - , 5 m m - , and 8 m m - pore ﬁlters with 2 3 10 6 , 4 3 10 5 , and 1 3 10 5 pores per cm 2 , respectively . Either tdTom A549s or 900 nm , 2 . 1 m m , or 6 . 7 m m beads ( Thermoﬁsher , streptavidin coated ) were mixed with engineered marrow cells in a 10 : 1 ratio ; 3 3 10 5 total cells were seeded on top of the pore ﬁlters . Beads were opsonized with anti - streptavidin antibody ( S6390 , Sigma ) . The same 1 : 1 mixture of DMEM and F - 12 , supplemented with 15 % FBS and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin , was added to both the top and bottom of each 24 - well insert such that there was no nutrient gradient across the pore ﬁlter . After incubating for approximately 24 hr at 37 (cid:4) C and 5 % CO 2 , cells were harvested from the tops of the ﬁlters using Trypsin and from the bottoms using both Trypsin and scraping . In some experiments , beads were pre - incubated with anti - SIRP a macro - phages for 150 min prior to being plated on tops of transwells . RNA Isolation and Sequencing For RNA isolation , an RNeasy plus Mini Kit ( QIAGEN ) was used . For RNA - seq analyses , RNA samples were sent to the Next - Gen - eration Sequencing Core at the Perelman School of Medicine , University of Pennsylvania , PA . Libraries for RNA - seq were made using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep kit ( Illumina ) per manufacturer instructions , followed by 100 bp paired - end sequencing with HiSeq 2500 ( Illumina ) . Ten cDNA libraries were pooled together , resulting in (cid:1) 16 , 000 , 000 reads for each sample . e5 Current Biology 27 , 2065 – 2077 . e1 – e6 , July 24 , 2017 Synthesis of Soft and Stiff Polyacrylamide Gels Round glass coverslips ( 18 mm , Fisher Scientiﬁc ) were cleaned in boiling ethanol and RCA solution ( H 2 O : H 2 O 2 : NH 4 OH = 2 : 1 : 1 in volume ) for 10 min each , and then functionalized in ATCS solution ( chloroform with 0 . 1 % allytrichlorosilane ( Sigma ) and 0 . 1 % trime - thylamine ( Sigma ) ) for an hour . Fresh precursor solution for 0 . 3 kPa soft gels ( 3 % acrylamide + 0 . 07 % bis - arylamide in DI water ) and 40 kPa stiff gels ( 10 % acrylamide + 0 . 3 % bis - acrylamide in DI water ) were prepared . Afterward , 0 . 1 % N , N , N’ , N’ - tetramethylethyle - nediamine ( Sigma ) and 1 % ammonium persulphate ( Sigma ) were added to each precursor solution , and 20 m L of the resulting mixture were added to each coverslip to allow gel polymerization . To achieve collagen - I coating , crosslinker sulpho - sanpah ( 50 m g / ml in 50 mM HEPES , G - Biosciences ) was applied over the whole gel surface and photoactivated under 365 nm UV light for 7 min . Excess sulpho - sanpah was washed away following UV activation , and then collagen - I solution ( 100 m g / ml in 50 mM HEPES ) was applied overnight at RT with gentle shaking . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 4 . Unless otherwise noted , all statistical comparisons were made by unpaired two - tailed Student’s t test and were considered signiﬁcant if p < 0 . 05 . Unless mentioned , all plots show mean ± SEM ‘‘n’’ indicates the number of tumors , cells , or wells quantiﬁed in each experiment and is R 3 in all experiments , except for RNA sequencing data which is for R 2 samples per condition . Figure legends specify the exact meaning of ‘‘n’’ for each ﬁgure . Current Biology 27 , 2065 – 2077 . e1 – e6 , July 24 , 2017 e6
