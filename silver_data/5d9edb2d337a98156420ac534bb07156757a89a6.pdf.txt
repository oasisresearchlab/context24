SWELL1 ( LRRC8A ) was recently identi - ﬁed as an essential component of VRAC . However , the identity of the pore - forming subunits of VRAC and how the channel is gated by cell swelling are un - known . Here , we show that SWELL1 and up to four other LRRC8 subunits assemble into heterogeneous complexes of (cid:1) 800 kDa . When reconstituted into bi - layers , LRRC8 complexes are sufﬁcient to form anion channels activated by osmolality gradients . In bila - yers , as well as in cells , the single - channel conduc - tance of the complexes depends on the LRRC8 composition . Finally , low ionic strength ( G ) in the absence of an osmotic gradient activates the com - plexes in bilayers . These data demonstrate that LRRC8 proteins together constitute the VRAC pore and that hypotonic stress can activate VRAC through a decrease in cytoplasmic G . INTRODUCTION The ability to maintain constant cell volume is fundamental to cell function . Osmotically swollen cells restore their original volume and protect themselves via a process called regulatory volume decrease ( RVD ) . This tightly controlled RVD is achieved by the activation of swelling - activated ion channels and K + Cl (cid:3) co - transporters mediating ion and osmolyte efﬂux together with osmotically obligated water . Swelling - activated chloride cur - rents ( I Cl , swell ) , mediated by a volume - regulated anion channel ( VRAC ) , have been observed in nearly every vertebrate cell type , including lymphocytes , neurons , astrocytes , cardiac myo - cytes , and endothelial cells ( Akita and Okada , 2014 ; Hoffmann et al . , 2009 ; Pedersen et al . , 2015 ) . LRRC8A ( also named ‘‘SWELL1’’ ) was recently shown to be an essential component of VRAC since knockdown or deletion of SWELL1 abolished I Cl , swell ( Qiu et al . , 2014 ; Voss et al . , 2014 ) . SWELL1 ( LRRC8A ) is conserved across vertebrate species , and four additional homologous family members ( LRRC8B - E ) are usually present in their genomes ( Abascal and Zardoya , 2012 ; Kubota et al . , 2004 ) . Deletion and rescue studies have shown that VRAC requires SWELL1 and at least one other LRRC8 subunit for function ( Voss et al . , 2014 ) . Co - expression of LRRC8 subunits in heterologous systems has revealed sub - unit interactions by co - immunoprecipitation ( Lee et al . , 2014 ; Voss et al . , 2014 ) . A scanning cysteine mutagenesis approach identiﬁed the residue threonine 44 ( T44 ) just external to the pre - dicted transmembrane domain 1 of SWELL1 , which , when mutated , altered the relative preference for two anions ( I (cid:3) and Cl (cid:3) ) , suggesting that SWELL1 is in close proximity ( or part ) of the pore ( Qiu et al . , 2014 ) . The extent of VRAC inactivation at positive voltages was subunit dependent , suggesting that LRRC8 proteins are likely associated with the channel ( Voss et al . , 2014 ) . A recent report revealing subunit - speciﬁc effects on taurine ﬂux is consistent with LRRC8C - E contributing to the pore ( Planells - Cases et al . , 2015 ) . These studies indicate that VRAC is composed of at least two subunits that are part of an anion - selective channel . However , SWELL1 overexpression caused decreased I Cl , swell ( Qiu et al . , 2014 ; Voss et al . , 2014 ) , and LRRC8 members , together with SWELL1 , could not increase I Cl , swell above wild - type ( WT ) levels , suggesting that they may not be sufﬁcient for VRAC activity . This raises questions on whether SWELL1 / LRRC8s are pore - forming subunits and hints at the requirement for other limiting factors / proteins ( Kunzelmann , 2015 ; Qiu et al . , 2014 ; Voss et al . , 2014 ) . The mechanisms by which VRAC is activated by cell swelling have been debated for decades . Water inﬂux and subsequent swelling have multiple consequences that involve local de - creases in ion concentrations and changes in macromolecule crowding ( Zhou et al . , 2008 ) , alterations in plasma membrane domains ( Trouet et al . , 1999 ) , potential changes in bilayer tension ( Anishkin et al . , 2014 ; Brohawn et al . , 2014 ) , alter - ations in cytoskeleton , and activation of second - messenger pathways , including kinases and phosphatases , among others ( Hoffmann et al . , 2009 ; Pedersen et al . , 2015 ) . Importantly , it is unknown whether VRAC itself contains a sensor for the adequate stimulus during swelling or whether gating requires other cellular Cell 164 , 499 – 511 , January 28 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . 499 components ( e . g . , cytoskeleton , enzymes , and second messen - gers ) . The most discussed mechanisms are increased mem - brane stress and disruption of cytoskeleton ( Hoffmann et al . , 2009 ; Nilius et al . , 1996 ) .

In the present study , we address two critical unsolved questions : what are the proteins that form the VRAC channel pore , and how does cell swelling lead to VRAC activation ? RESULTS Biochemical Analysis of SWELL1 - Containing Protein Complexes To biochemically characterize SWELL1 ( LRRC8A ) and its associated proteins , we generated a HeLa cell line that could be induced to express SWELL1 tagged with FLAG at its carboxy - terminus ( SWELL1 - FLAG ) ( Figure 1A ; Figure S1 ) . SWELL1 - FLAG rescued swelling - acti - vated chloride currents ( I Cl , swell ) in SWELL1 knockdown cells just like the WT gene ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the tag has no obvious effect on SWELL1 function . Consistent with previ - ous reports ( Voss et al . , 2014 ; Qiu et al . , 2014 ) , SWELL1 overexpression induced by high tetracycline ( TET ) concentrations ( R 50ng / ml ) decreased I Cl , swell ( FigureS1B ) . This inhibitory effect was not observed at low TET concentra - tions ( 5 and 10 ng / ml ) , which only increased SWELL1 mRNA expression within 2 - fold above its endogenous level . We utilized 500 Cell 164 , 499 – 511 , January 28 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . 5 ng / ml TET for our biochemical experiments to ensure that ra - tios of SWELL1 and associated proteins were not considerably disrupted ( uninduced cells expressed insufﬁcient amounts of SWELL1 - FLAG for biochemical studies ; Figures 1A – 1C ) . FLAG afﬁnity puriﬁcation from lysates of cells treated with 5 ng / ml TET revealed only one prominent protein band at (cid:1) 800 kDa after native gel electrophoresis and Coomassie blue staining ( Fig - ure 1B ) . Western blots with an anti - SWELL1 antibody conﬁrmed that this band contained SWELL1 ( Figure 1C ) . To determine whether additional proteins might loosely interact with the (cid:1) 800 - kDa complex , we treated live cells with the crosslinker paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) before the puriﬁcation procedure and found little or no detectable increase in the size of the SWELL1 protein complex on the native gel ( Figure 1D versus Figures 1B and 1C ) . LRRC8B , LRRC8C , LRRC8D , and LRRC8E each co - immuno - precipitates with SWELL1 in a heterologous overexpression system ( Voss et al . , 2014 ) . To identify the proteins associated with SWELL1 in native complexes , we subjected the puriﬁed (cid:1) 800 - kDa band to mass spectrometry analysis and found that , in addition to SWELL1 , many peptides derived from all four LRRC8 family members were detected ( Figure 1E ) . No other spe - ciﬁc interacting proteins were consistently observed , including known pore - forming ion channels ( Table S1 ) . Furthermore , mass spectrometry of the entire puriﬁed solution without gel sep - aration revealed similar results ( data not shown ) . These data indi - cate that , although it is possible that SWELL1 associates with other proteins in addition to its LRRC8 homologs , such an asso - ciation might not be strong enough to withstand the FLAG afﬁnity puriﬁcation process . We refer to SWELL1 and its associated LRRC8 homologs as ‘‘SWELL1 - containing complexes . ’’ Next , we used the crosslinker formaldehyde ( FA ) to examine the oligomeric state of the subunits . FA - treated samples sub - jected to denaturing electrophoresis revealed at least ﬁve major bands in addition to larger unresolved molecular species ( Fig - ure 1F ) . The distribution of bands ( consistent with increments of (cid:1) 95 kDa , the predicted size of each subunit ) suggests that they correspond to monomer , dimer , trimer , tetramer , pentamer , and potentially higher order oligomers . LRRC8 proteins are pro - posed to form hexamers based on their homology with pannex - ins ( Abascal and Zardoya , 2012 ) . The (cid:1) 800 - kDa complex observed on native gels ( Figures 1B – 1D ) would predict up to eight subunits per complex if only the primary sequence is considered . However , slow migration and overestimation of mo - lecular masses are not uncommon for membrane protein com - plexes due to many factors , such as glycosylation ( Voss et al . , 2014 ) and bound detergent and lipid molecules , which can add up to 20 % mass ( Wittig et al . , 2010 ) . Considering the potential size overestimation , the actual mass of SWELL1 - containing complexes may vary roughly between six to eight times the pre - dicted molecular weight of single LRRC8 polypeptides , suggest - ing the presence of six to eight LRRC8 subunits per complex . In an effort to address the stoichiometry of LRRC8 proteins in the puriﬁed complex , we used quantitative mass spectrometry with stable - isotope - labeled peptide standards ( Table S2 ) . Sur - prisingly , the relative concentration varied dramatically among each LRRC8 protein ( Figure 1E ) , with SWELL1 being the most abundant and LRRC8B being the rarest . These data are consis - tent with the lack of a speciﬁc immutable combination of sub - units in each complex . Thus , puriﬁed complexes appear to be a heterogeneous assortment of multimers composed of mainly SWELL1 in combination with other LRRC8 subunits . Functional Reconstitution of SWELL1 - Containing Complexes in Lipid Bilayers To assess whether puriﬁed LRRC8 protein complexes can form functional channels consistent with mediating I Cl , swell , we used a simple bilayer system amenable to challenge with osmotic stim - uli . Protein was supplemented in the droplet attached to the commanding potential electrode termed cis , in the presence of ATP to block channels that may insert into the bilayer with extra - cellular domains exposed to the cis side ( Jackson and Strange , 1995 ; Tsumura et al . , 1996 ) ; the trans droplet was grounded . A hypotonic gradient was generated by supplementing 300 mM mannitol ( cis ) to cause water inﬂux into this droplet ( i . e . , cytoplasmic side ) . Although we initially chose 500 mM KCl to enhance signal - to - noise and to resolve detailed features of single - channel currents , we found similar results using physio - logical osmolarities and salt concentrations ( discussed later ) . Channel activity was not observed when the protein was recon - stituted in isotonic solution ( Figure 1G ) , whereas a spectrum of single - channel conductance ( g ) ranging from (cid:1) 10 pS to 50 pS at (cid:3) 100 mV and open probability ( P o ) ranging from 0 . 1 to 0 . 6 were reproducibly observed when complexes were exposed to a hypotonic stimulus ( examples are shown in Figures 1H – 1J ) . Importantly , activity was observed only when mannitol was intro - duced asymmetrically in the cis droplet ( Figures 1H – 1J ) but not when equal concentrations of mannitol were present in both cis and trans droplets ( Figure S2A ) . To exclude the possibility that mannitol elicited activity by a mechanism distinct from osmotic disequilibrium , we tested whether sucrose could also stimulate activity . Distinct channel activity with a range of g was observed when the hypotonic stimulus was generated by a sucrose gradient , indicating that mannitol is not speciﬁcally activating channel complexes ( Figures S2B and S2C ) . To assess whether ATPisrequiredforchannelfunction , weperformedreconstitution studies in the absence of ATP in both cis and trans droplets while maintaining the relevant hypotonic stimulus . ATP was not required for us to observe distinct channel activity ( Figure S3A ) ; however , our bilayer studies cannot address whether there is a higher propensity for inactive channels in the absence of ATP . The hypotonicity - induced channel activity was blocked by injec - tion of a VRAC blocker 4 - [ ( 2 - butyl - 6 , 7 - dichloro - 2 - cyclopentyl - 2 , 3 - dihydro - 1 - oxo - 1 H - inden - 5 - yl ) oxy ] butanoic acid ( DCPIB ) in either droplet ( Figure 1K and data not shown ) . To test whether the reconstituted channels retained ion selec - tivity , lipid bilayers were created with 500 mM potassium gluco - nate on both sides ( Figure S3B ) . Hypotonicity - induced currents at (cid:3) 100 mV in 500 mM potassium gluconate were smaller in amplitude ( ranging from (cid:1) 0 . 4 to 0 . 8 pA ) than those in 500 mM KCl solution ( (cid:1) 1 – 5 pA ) , indicating the dependence of currents on the anion species ( not K + ) and that channels are capable of ﬂuxing gluconate to some extent . These experiments provide ev - idence that isolated SWELL1 - containing complexes incorpo - rated into lipid bilayers act as bona ﬁde anionic channels induced by hypotonicity and are sensitive to DCPIB .

We focused on heteromers containing SWELL1 and only one other LRRC8 subunit . Speciﬁcally , we used clustered regularly inter - spaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) - Cas9 technology to disrupt multiple LRRC8 genes in HeLa - inducible cells ( Table S3 ) . The puriﬁed SWELL1 - containing complexes from triple and quadruple knockout ( KO ) cells migrated to the same position on a native gel as the sample from WT HeLa - inducible cells ( Fig - ure 2A ) .

See Figure S4 and Table S3 . 502 Cell 164 , 499 – 511 , January 28 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . three or all four LRRC8 homologs . Mass spectrometry conﬁrmed the predicted compositions of SWELL1 - containing complexes puriﬁed from the various KO cell lines ( Figure 2B ) . For example , the protein sample puriﬁed from LRRC8 ( B / D / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells con - tained only SWELL1 and LRRC8C ( Figure 2B , red bar ) . Next , we characterized I Cl , swell in KO cell lines ( Figure 2C ) . Interestingly , whole - cell current densities in LRRC8 ( B / C / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) and LRRC8 ( B / C / D ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells were similar to those in WT cells , while LRRC8 ( B / D / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) current densities were reduced by about half . In agreement with previous ﬁndings for human HCT116 cells ( Voss et al . , 2014 ) , I Cl , swell was essentially not detected from LRRC8 ( B / C / D / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells ( Figure 2C ) , although homomeric SWELL1 complexes of (cid:1) 800 kDa were observed ( Figure 2A ) . These data conﬁrm that SWELL1 and at least one other LRRC8 subunit are required for whole - cell VRAC activity . A wide range of swelling - induced outwardly rectifying single - channel Cl (cid:3) conductances , all having the essential characteris - tics of VRAC , has been reported in cells ( Nilius et al . , 1996 ; Okada , 1997 ) . In our droplet lipid bilayer experiments , SWELL1 - containing complexes puriﬁed from WT cells also ex - hibited a broad g range at both positive and negative voltages ( Figures 1H – 1J ; Figure 2D ) . To test whether g is determined by LRRC8 complex composition , we recorded single - channel cur - rents of puriﬁed protein from KO cells expressing only two sub - units . Remarkably , proteins puriﬁed from LRRC8 ( B / D / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) , LRRC8 ( B / C / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) , and LRRC8 ( B / C / D ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells produced hypo - tonicity - induced channel activities with a more limited g range compared to WT ( Figures 2E – 2G ) . For simplicity , we refer to protein complexes puriﬁed from LRRC8 ( B / D / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) , LRRC8 ( B / C / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) , and LRRC8 ( B / C / D ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells as LRRC8 A + C , A + D , and A + E , respectively . The g of LRRC8 A + C ( Figure 2E , red ) , A + D ( Figure 2F , blue ) , and A + E ( Figure 2G , green ) were calculated at both positive and negative voltages . The calculated g values of LRRC8 A + C , A + D , and A + E differ signiﬁcantly from each other and were all represented within the conductance spectrum observed for WT . These experiments provide evidence that each LRRC8 heteromeric complex exhibits a distinct g range and that the WT sample contains mixtures of heteromers that produces the observed broad g range . Surprisingly , although I Cl , swell was not observed in LRRC8 ( B / C / D / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells using the standard whole - cell voltage ramp pro - tocol , SWELL1 - containing complexes puriﬁed from these cells produced DCPIB - sensitive hypotonicity - induced currents at (cid:3) 100 mV , but not 100 mV , in lipid bilayers ( Figure 2H ; Figure S4 ) . The discrepancy between whole - cell and lipid bilayer current re - cordings for SWELL1 homomers is not currently understood . Technical limitations may prohibit the study of homomers at 100 mV , since only steady - state current activity is measured in the lipid bilayers . Based on the results from triple and quadruple KO samples , we assign the populations with smallest g at (cid:3) 100 mV to SWELL1 homomers ( Figure 2H , brown ; 8 – 16 pS ) that signiﬁcantly differs from the g range of heteromeric LRRC8 A + C ( 35 – 47 pS ) , A + D ( 14 – 19 pS ) , and A + E ( 23 – 33 pS ) complexes at (cid:3) 100 mV ( Figures 2E – 2G ) . These results suggest that SWELL1 homomers form stable channels in lipid bilayers ( Figure 2H ) and co - exist with heteromers composed of SWELL1 and other LRRC8 subunits ( Figures2D – 2G ) . Importantly , channelactivityre - corded from the puriﬁed proteins indicates that the g range is dependent on the identity of the LRRC8 subunit associating with SWELL1 in the complex . These experiments also rule out the possibility that a rare impurity , rather than a SWELL1 - contain - ing complex , accounts for the channel activities we observed . LRRC8 - Mediated Single - Channel Currents from Swollen HeLa Cells Next , we validated the VRAC g variability in native cells . We per - formed cell - attached patch clamp recordings from HeLa cells in isotonic ( ISO ) versus hypotonic ( HYPO ; 265 mOsm / kg ) solution to identify VRAC - like single - channel events . Cells were bathed in high K + solutions to suppress RVD . We generated another panel of LRRC8 KO lines in WT HeLa cells ( Table S4 ) and used LRRC8 ( A / B / C / D / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells , which had essentially no I Cl , swell , to conﬁrm that any observed activity was , indeed , mediated by VRAC ( data not shown ) . In HYPO solution , small single - channel currents were observed in (cid:1) 50 % of the LRRC8 ( A / B / C / D / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) patches at positive potentials ( resting potential [ RP ] + 100 mV ) ( mean ± SEM , 1 . 0 ± 0 . 07 pA , n = 20 ; Figure S5A ) . Similar activity was also observed when the cells were bathed in ISO solution ( 1 . 4 ± 0 . 3 pA , n = 5 ) . These small conductance channels ( (cid:1) 10 pS ) were also observed in WT cells and had a similar incidence of occurrence , independent of swelling ( in ISO : 0 . 98 ± 0 . 04 pA , n = 5 ; in HYPO : 1 . 0 ± 0 . 1 pA , n = 10 ; Figure S5B ) . Since these single - channel currents were independent of cell type and osmotic stimulus , any single - channel activity with amplitudes less than 1 . 7 pA ( 2 SD above the mean ) was deemed as background . In addition to this background current , when WT cells were bathed in HYPO solution and cell - attached patches from swollen cells were made , larger amplitude , inacti - vating single - channel currents were observed at positive poten - tials . Importantly , these larger currents were not observed in LRRC8 ( A / B / C / D / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) control cells . Single - channel currents from swollen WT HeLa cells revealed a pronounced heterogene - ity in current amplitude from 1 . 8 pA to 7 . 3 pA at 100 mV above RP ( Figure 3A ) . These types of currents were not observed in patches from WT cells in ISO solution ( n = 5 ) . To determine whether conductance depended on subunit composition , we tested LRRC8 ( B / D / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) and LRRC8 ( B / C / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . The corresponding LRRC8 A + C and A + D hetero - mers exhibited the largest and smallest conductances , res - pectively , in bilayers . Interestingly , LRRC8 ( B / D / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells revealed single - channel currents with amplitudes from 3 . 1 to 6 . 4 pA ( 4 . 65 ± 0 . 18 pA , n = 22 ; Figure 3B ) , while LRRC8 ( B / C / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) showed single - channel currents from 2 . 0 to 3 . 4 pA ( 2 . 48 ± 0 . 18 pA , n = 7 ; Figure 3C ) , a statistically signiﬁcant differ - ence ( Student’s t test , p < 0 . 001 ) . Currents greater than 1 . 7 pA were not observed when cells were bathed in ISO solution ( n = 12 and 10 for LRRC8 ( B / D / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) and LRRC8 ( B / C / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) , respectively ) . Therefore , the cellular data corroborate the hetero - geneity observed for reconstituted SWELL1 - containing com - plexes in droplet lipid bilayers and underscore the importance of subunit composition to channel conductance . LRRC8 Subunit Composition Dictates VRAC Rectiﬁcation One of the characteristic features of VRAC is its outward rectiﬁ - cation , i . e . , larger outward currents ( Cl (cid:3) inﬂux ) than inward Cell 164 , 499 – 511 , January 28 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . 503 currents ( Cl (cid:3) efﬂux ) at positive versus negative membrane po - tentials , respectively ( Nilius et al . , 1996 ; Pedersen et al . , 2015 ) . Single - channel analysis and all - points current histo - grams revealed that puriﬁed LRRC8 A + C , A + D , and A + E het - eromers retained outward rectiﬁcation in lipid bilayers ( Figures 4A – 4C ) . The currents at positive voltage were larger compared to currents at negative voltage for all complexes ( Figures 4A – 4C ; Figure S6 ) . To determine whether rectiﬁcation properties depended on subunit composition , we analyzed the extent of single - channel rectiﬁcation for both g ( Figures 4D – 4F ) and P o ( Figures 4G – 4I ) . The ratio of g observed at positive to negative potentials was the same for LRRC8 A + C , A + D , and A + E , sug - gesting that the extent of rectiﬁcation due to g is the same for all complexes tested ( Figure 4F ) . Interestingly , the ratio of P o acquired at 100 to that of (cid:3) 100 mV was signiﬁcantly greater for LRRC8 A + D compared to LRRC8 A + C and LRRC8 A + E ( Figure 4I ) . Remarkably , the outward rectiﬁcation of I Cl , swell in whole - cell recordings of the triple KO cells mirrored that observed in lipid bilayers ( Figures 4J – 4K ) . The ratio of currents ( I outward / I inward ) recorded from LRRC8 ( B / C / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells was larger compared to LRRC8 ( B / D / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) and LRRC8 ( B / C / D ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells ( Figure 4K ) . Our single - channel data conﬁrm previous ﬁndings that whole - cell rectiﬁcation is , in part , due to differences in g at positive versus negative potentials ( Nilius et al . , 1996 ) . Bilayer studies suggest that P o can also contribute to rectiﬁca - tion in LRRC8D - containing heteromeric complexes . The inability to record for longer times from cell - attached patches on swollen cells at large positive potentials limited us from obtaining substantial data to determine accurate P o values and , therefore , prohibited a direct comparison between bilayers and cells . Nonetheless , rectiﬁcation properties depend on LRRC8 subunit composition . LRRC8 Subunits Associating with SWELL1 Contribute to Ion Selectivity Since it is generally agreed that channel conductance is a prop - erty of the pore , these bilayer data indicate that LRRC8C - E can contribute to pore properties of SWELL1 - containing complexes .

Our previous mutagenesis screen identiﬁed T44 as a critical residue of SWELL1 , as cysteine replacement of this residue ( T44C ) signiﬁcantly increased I (cid:3) versus Cl (cid:3) permeability ( P I / P Cl ) . T44 is predicted to be located at the external boundary of TM1 and , intriguingly , is a conserved residue in the other LRRC8 subunits except LRRC8B .

The reversal potential ( V rev ) of hypotonicity - induced currents was determined when I (cid:3) or Cl (cid:3) was the only permeant extracellular anion and P I / P Cl was calculated from the difference in V rev as previously described ( Qiu et al . , 2014 ) . While I Cl , swell in all cells reversed near E Cl as expected , V rev in the I (cid:3) solution for all T44C mutants was signiﬁcantly shifted to more negative poten - tials compared to their corresponding WT controls ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . This indicates that , like SWELL1 T44C , cysteine muta - tions at T44 in other LRRC8 subunits also enhance P I / P Cl ( Fig - ure 5C ) . Additionally , compared to native I Cl , swell in HeLa - induc - ible cells , VRAC currents rescued by WT LRRC8C or LRRC8E showed a signiﬁcantly higher I (cid:3) selectivity , while WT LRRC8D re - vealed a reduced P I / P Cl ( Figure 5 ) . This suggests that LRRC8 subunits also affect VRAC I (cid:3) versus Cl (cid:3) selectivity in HeLa cells . Taken together , the g and rectiﬁcation properties in lipid bilayers and the ﬁnding that LRRC8 subunits and their point mutations contribute to anion selectivity demonstrate that LRRC8C - E pro - teins can contribute to the VRAC pore . LRRC8 Protein Complexes Are Activated by Low Intracellular Ionic Strength Permeation properties of I Cl , swell have been well studied ( Akita and Okada , 2014 ; Pedersen et al . , 2015 ) , but the activation mechanism of VRAC at the molecular level is not understood . Hypotonicity - induced cell swelling and increase in the cell vol - ume could evoke numerous physiologically relevant effects , including ( 1 ) mechanical changes in the cells , ( 2 ) alterations in cellular signaling , and ( 3 ) local decreases in the intracellular ion concentration due to water inﬂux . Our protein puriﬁcation and reconstitution approach excluded an essential role of cellular components and signaling pathways in the activa - tion of SWELL1 - containing complexes . Thus , we examined whether any of the remaining mechanisms , i . e . , mechanical changes in the membrane or decreases in ionic strength ( G ) , are essential for the activity of puriﬁed protein complexes in droplet lipid bilayers . To assess the activation mechanism based on volume increase and membrane stretch , LRRC8 A + C , A + D , and A + E heteromers were reconstituted in lipid bi - layers under ISO conditions ( 500 mM KCl , 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ) , and 40 nl of this solution was injected into either the cis or trans droplet of the pre - formed bilayers . This injec - tion resulted in (cid:1) 20 % increase in the droplet volume but did not evoke channel activity for any of the LRRC8 heteromers tested ( n = 9 ; data not shown ) . This stimulus was , however , sufﬁcient to activate mechanically activated MscS channels ( data not shown ) ( Battle et al . , 2009 ) . This suggests that the in - crease in droplet volume and the subsequent mechanical changes in the lipid bilayer is not the likely cause of channel activity . A B C n . s .

Next , we screened the effect of low G on the activation of SWELL1 - containing complexes . Three different salt concentra - tions were tested in the lipid bilayers : 500 mM KCl to represent high G ( standard solution for droplet bilayer recordings ) , 150 mM KCl to represent physiological G , and 70 mM KCl to represent low G .

Since decreasing the G from physiological 150 mM KCl to low 70 mM KCl also de - creases osmolality of the solution from (cid:1) 300 mOsm / kg to (cid:1) 140 mOsm / kg , we tested whether channel activity in 70 mM KCl was due to decreased G or decreased osmolality . LRRC8 A + E activ - ity was still observed when osmolality was kept at physiological levels by sup - plementing 160 mM mannitol while decreasing G to 70 mM KCl ( Figure 6D ) , indicating that the protein complex can be activated by lowering the G in the absence of an osmotic gradient . Discrete single - channel currents were recorded that exhibited a g of 8 ± 2 pS , comparable to channel properties observed in the isotonic 70 mM KCl solution ( Figures 6C and 6D ) . LRRC8 A + C and A + D activity was also reproducibly observed in isotonic 70 mM KCl ( Figures 6E and 6F ) but not in 150 or 500 mM KCl ( Figure 6F ) . Regardless of the combination of LRRC8 heteromers , all SWELL1 - containing com - plexes tested produced DCPIB - sensitive currents in droplet bilayers under low G conditions ( data not shown ) . These data indicate that SWELL1 - containing complexes are activated by lowering the G in a mini - malistic bilayer system . DISCUSSION VRAC is activated during shifts in osmotic homeostasis that lead to cell swelling and contributes to a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes ( Akita and Okada , 2014 ; Hoff - mann et al . , 2009 ; Kunzelmann , 2015 ) . Here , we take advantage Cell 164 , 499 – 511 , January 28 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . 507 of our recent identiﬁcation of SWELL1 ( Qiu et al . , 2014 ) as an essential component of VRAC to purify and characterize SWELL1 - containing complexes . We gained three fundamental insights using a combination of biochemical and electrophysio - logical methods . First , VRAC is a heterogeneous collection of high - molecular - weight ( (cid:1) 800 kDa ) complexes composed of LRRC8 proteins , which , when puriﬁed and incorporated in lipid bilayers , can be directly activated by an osmotic gradient . Sec - ond , SWELL1 and LRRC8C - E subunits together are sufﬁcient to make pore - forming ion channels ; channel conductance , permeability , and rectiﬁcation depend on the nature of the asso - ciating non - SWELL1 LRRC8 protein . Third , low G directly gates VRAC in a minimalistic bilayer system , giving us a mechanistic insight on how VRAC is gated in response to cell swelling . This ﬁnding also indicates that VRAC opening does not require other cellular components and that the sensor is encoded within the channel complex . VRAC Is a Heterogeneous Collection of Ion Channels Composed of LRRC8 Proteins By immunoprecipitating SWELL1 from HeLa cells , we identiﬁed all other members of LRRC8 family ( LRRC8B - E ) but no other pro - teins , speciﬁcally associating with SWELL1 in an (cid:1) 800 - kDa native complex . Interestingly , the ratio of associating proteins was not consistent with the existence of a single entity . However , the number of subunits per pore - forming complex appears to be constant , regardless of subunit composition . Given the homol - ogy of LRRC8 proteins to pannexin ( Abascal and Zardoya , 2012 ) , their predicted unmodiﬁed molecular weights ( (cid:1) 95 kDa ) , and their likelihood of being glycosylated ( Voss et al . , 2014 ) , LRRC8 subunits probably assemble as hexameric channels . SWELL1 is an obligatory subunit in this complex ( Qiu et al . , 2014 ; Voss et al . , 2014 ) , and at least one of the other four LRRC8 homologs is required ( Figure 2 ; Voss et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , the exact stoichiometry and intramolecular arrangement of SWELL1 and other LRRC8 subunits within the pore - forming complex are still unknown , and the anticipated ﬂexibility in stoichiometry and arrangement suggests the exis - tence of a very large cohort of disparate VRAC channels . Given the complexity , future single - molecule and structural studies are required to determine the stoichiometry and oligomeric state of LRRC8 heteromers . Several ligand - gated ion channel families exhibit similar ﬂexibilities in subunit composition and their arrangement ( Hille , 2001 ) . However , this structural diversity with its consequential functional diversity in channel biophysical properties makes VRAC unique among ion channels . Speciﬁc LRRC8 Subunits Associate with SWELL1 to Dictate Channel Properties An intermediate g range for VRAC has been described among different tissues and cells over the past 3 decades ( Nilius et al . , 1996 ; Okada , 1997 ) . Although the currents were swelling depen - dent , the early studies suffered from a lack of molecular identity of VRAC and speciﬁc pharmacological tools . Furthermore , the underlying causes of this heterogeneity were not known . The identiﬁcation of the LRRC8 gene family as essential com - ponents of VRAC enabled us , with certainty , to identify LRRC8 - dependent swelling - induced single - channel currents in cellular assays . Cell - attached patches from swollen HeLa cells revealed a wide range of current amplitudes . Although most early studies using cell - attached patches did not comment on current ampli - tude heterogeneity ( Okada et al . , 1994 ; Weiss and Lang , 1992 ) , one study reported channels with at least two signiﬁcantly different conductances with features of I Cl , swell ( e . g . , run down , inactivation at positive voltages ) ( Solc and Wine , 1991 ) . Our sin - gle - channel studies conducted in droplet lipid bilayers also demonstrated the conductance heterogeneity of LRRC8 pro - teins . Outward single - channel currents in WT HeLa cells re - vealed a wide g range from 18 to 73 pS at 100 mV ( assuming an RP of 0 mV ) . However , when cells expressed only two of the ﬁve subunits , LRRC8 ( B / D / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) and LRRC8 ( B / C / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) , the g range became narrow and non - overlapping , similar to those observed in the lipid bilayers . The g values obtained from swollen HeLa cells recorded in (cid:1) 100 mM Cl (cid:3) lie between those observed in lipid bilayers formed in the presence of either 70 mM or 500 mM Cl (cid:3) . Regardless of the assay , the conductance of puri - ﬁed complexes reconstituted into lipid bilayers and VRAC ex - pressed in cellular membranes depend on the identity of the associating subunit ( LRRC8C - E ) . Consistent with previous re - ports ( Nilius et al . , 1996 ; Okada , 1997 ) , single - channel currents from all combinations tested revealed similar rectiﬁcation , where outward is greater than inward current in both cellular and lipid bilayer assays . Another way to probe whether LRRC8 - associating proteins contribute to pore properties is to determine whether mutations alter relative permeability . Mutating the homologous T44 residue in LRRC8C , LRRC8D , and LRRC8E to a cysteine increased the relative permeability of I (cid:3) compared to Cl (cid:3) , in a manner similar to that observed with SWELL1 ( Qiu et al . , 2014 ) . Interestingly , WT LRRC8D subunits had signiﬁcantly lower I (cid:3) versus Cl (cid:3) permeability than either LRRC8C or LRR8CE . These results indi - cate that not only SWELL1 but also each LRRC8 protein contrib - utes to the permeation properties of VRAC . The heterogeneity of functional VRAC properties that we observed in bilayers must be a consequence of the diversity of heteromeric channels identiﬁed in our biochemical studies . The combination of speciﬁc LRRC8 homologs determines intrinsic channel properties , such as conductance and relative perme - ability . We propose that the heterogeneity of most , if not all , VRAC biophysical properties between different native tissues is regulated by differential expression of LRRC8 isoforms . Inter - estingly , another common characteristic of VRAC whole - cell current ( i . e . , its variable inactivation kinetics at high positive po - tentials ) was also shown to depend on LRRC8 homolog compo - sition ( Voss et al . , 2014 ) . Recently , LRRC8D , but not LRRC8C or LRRC8E , was shown to be required for the inﬂux of certain che - motherapeutics ( Planells - Cases et al . , 2015 ) . The physiological relevance of having molecularly diverse VRAC channels is currently unknown , but it is likely that cell - and tissue - speciﬁc expression of particular LRRC8 proteins is important in speci - fying roles of VRAC in that tissue . LRRC8C has been reported to contribute to adipocyte differentiation and diet - induced obesity ( Hayashi et al . , 2011 ; Tominaga et al . , 2004 ) , but whether this is due to its VRAC function is not known . Our results provide the basis to explore these questions through expression analysis and genetic studies of all LRRC8 isoforms . 508 Cell 164 , 499 – 511 , January 28 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . Volume - Sensing Mechanism ofLRRC8 Channel Proteins How expansion of cell volume is detected and subsequently transduced to VRAC activation is poorly understood . We have taken a minimalistic bilayer approach to study VRAC activation in the absence of cellular components that have been proposed to be involved in this process , such as cytoskeleton , caveoli , en - zymes , and second - messenger systems . What we are left with is puriﬁed SWELL1 - containing LRRC8 complexes and a simple lipid bilayer at the interface between two droplets , which can be experimentally manipulated . We can speciﬁcally test effects of mechanically induced stresses on the membrane or a decrease in ‘‘intracellular’’ G resulting from diffusion of water across the membrane . Puriﬁed complexes in these bilayers are silent , unless an osmotic gradient is imposed between droplets . Under these conditions , we found that injection of isotonic solu - tion into one droplet to increase its volume and perturb the bilayer was not sufﬁcient to induce channel activity , although control experiments indicated that the method activates MscS channels . On the other hand , when bilayers are formed with lower G in the cis ( i . e . , cytoplasmic side ) droplet , channels were active . Thus , these puriﬁed ion channels gate when the ionic concentration is reduced , indicating that SWELL1 - contain - ing complexes encode a sensor for low G . This intriguing hypoth - esis that decreased G , rather than cell swelling itself , is an adequate stimulus for VRAC was initially proposed by Nilius ( Ni - lius et al . , 1998 ; Sabirov et al . , 2000 ) , Strange ( Cannon et al . , 1998 ) , and their colleagues . A bacterial transporter OpuA is also triggered directly by a G mechanism ( Mahmood et al . , 2006 ) . In this case , high G causes the dissociation of surface - exposed cationic regions from negative phospholipid head groups ( electrostatic switching mechanism ) , leading to conformational changes in the protein ( Biemans - Oldehinkel et al . , 2006 ; Poolman et al . , 2004 ) . A similar interaction of cationic residues and negatively charged lipids has been described for the mammalian mechanoacti - vated TREK - 1 potassium channel ( Chemin et al . , 2005 ) . Normal or high G may maintain VRAC in a closed conformation so that inﬂux of water and reduction of ionic concentrations gates the channel . For instance , surface - exposed cationic domains , highly charged domains , and salt bridges have been shown to be critical for HCN2 and CNGA1 channel gating ( Craven and Zagotta , 2004 ) . The obligatory subunit SWELL1 may encode the sensor , or the sensor may be encoded by each associating subunit or the interfaces they make with SWELL1 or each other . The importance of subunit interfaces to gating is underscored in the ligand - gated ionotropic receptors ( Green and Nayeem , 2015 ) . Future mutagenesis and chimeric ap - proaches will enable the identiﬁcation of the G sensor ( s ) within SWELL1 - containing complexes . Predicted cytosolic domains that might be involved in sensing low G include the highly cationic TM2 - TM3 intracellular loop and proximal C - terminal tail , as well as negatively charged regions in the case of intra - molecular interactions . It should be noted , however , that the present study does not address whether low G is the only mechanism to activate I Cl , swell in cells ; it is likely that other mechanisms play concerted roles . Indeed , it is known that VRAC can also be activated in the absence of cell swelling ( Hoffmann et al . , 2009 ) . In summary , we demonstrate that puriﬁed SWELL1 - contain - ing complexes with at least one other LRRC8 subunit can form functional ion channels that can be directly activated by physiological stimuli . We show , in both minimalistic bilayer sys - tems and HeLa cells , that the particular LRRC8 subunit ( LRRC8C - E ) associating with SWELL1 determines the single - channel conductance and the relative permeability of I Cl , swell for iodide and chloride , indicating that these family members contribute to the pore . While other pathways such as phosphor - ylation and cytoskeletal interactions may contribute in intact cells , a sensor for low G is an integral part of puriﬁed SWELL1 - containing complexes . With these new data , the structural requirements for VRAC activation may now be addressed . A more complete understanding of volume - sensing mechanisms will undoubtedly lead to insights into the physiological roles of VRAC and help guide future therapeutic approaches in ischemia , stroke , and other pathologies . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Electrophysiology Whole - cell patch - clamp recordings were performed as described previously ( Qiu et al . , 2014 ) , except , in permeability studies , recording pipettes con - tained ( in millimolar ) : 130 CsCl , 10 HEPES , 4 MgATP ( pH 7 . 2 ) ; LRRC8 ( B / C / D / E ) (cid:3) / (cid:3) HeLa Flp - In T - REx cells were transfected with WT or T44C LRRC8C , LRRC8D , or LRRC8E and cultured without TET ; and the experi - menter was blinded to cell type . Cell - attached patch recordings were made on swollen cells using 7 - to 15 - M U pipettes containing ( in millimolar ) : 95 N - methyl - D - glucamine ( NMDG ) , 4 MgCl 2 , 4 NaCl , 5 TEA - Cl , 10 HEPES , 5 dextrose , 0 . 1 CdCl 2 , and 100 mannitol , using a protocol modiﬁed from previous studies ( Okada et al . , 1994 ; Wang et al . , 2005 ) . Cells were bathed in a high extracellular KCl solution ( either 265 or 300 mOsm ) to depolarize cells toward 0 mV and to inhibit RVD ( Okada et al . , 1994 ) . The 265 - mOsm solution contained ( in millimolar ) : 100 KCl , 1 . 5 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES , 10 dextrose , KOH to pH 7 . 4 , and 265 mOsm / kg with mannitol ( Vapro Vapor Pressure Osmometer , Wescor ) . The 300 mOsm solution included extra mannitol ( 35 mM ) . Reconstitution of SWELL1 - Containing Complexes in Droplet Lipid Bilayers Droplet lipid bilayers were formed asdescribed previously ( Bayley et al . , 2008 ; Syeda et al . , 2008 ) . Brieﬂy , lipid bilayers were formed between two droplets containing ( in millimolar ) : 0 . 5 1 , 2 - diphytanoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DPhPC ) , 500 KCl , 20 HEPES , at pH 7 . 4 in a hexadecane medium . For low G experiments , 500 mM KCl was replaced by either 150 or 70 mM KCl . Protein wasadded intheform ofproteoliposomes inthe cis droplet . Onlysingle - chan - nel records were selected for analysis to avoid anomalies in conductance and open probability determination ; however , multiple channels were also observed . Isotonic and Hypotonic Conditions in Droplet Lipid Bilayers Mannitol ( 300 mM ) was supplemented asymmetrically in the cis droplet to generate an osmolality imbalance , causing water ﬂux into the cis droplet . An isotonic condition refers to the symmetric solution in both droplets ( e . g . , 500 , 150 , or 70 mM KCl , or 70 mM KCl + 160 mM mannitol ) . Protein Orientation in Droplet Lipid Bilayers WeusedtheATP - sidedblockapproachaspreviouslydescribedforwhole - cell VRAC currents ( Jackson and Strange , 1995 ) to block inserted channels in the outside - in conﬁguration . In this method , the cis droplet contained Na 2 - ATP ( 4 mM ) . Activated SWELL1 - containing complexes were blocked by adding 4 mM Na 2 - ATP to the trans droplet , indicating extracellular domains faced the trans droplet . Channels usually inserted so that the intracellular side of the protein remained in the cis droplet .
