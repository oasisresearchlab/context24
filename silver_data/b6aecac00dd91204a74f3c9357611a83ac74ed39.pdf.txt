The dispro - portionate number of deaths caused by SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic has been substantially curtailed by the early development of highly eﬃcient vaccines , but scarce data are available on the kinetics of antibodies following mRNA vaccines . IgG antibodies directed against Sars - CoV2 spike - protein ( SP ) are strongly correlated to neu - tralizing antibodies and can be considered a surrogate marker of immune response to vaccine . 2 Our study ( ClinicalTrials . gov ID # NCT04733807 ) initially planned for a follow up of 12 months was stopped prematurely because the Italian Government scheduled a booster dose . The study cohort included 679 participants out of 683 health care workers ( four subjects refused vaccination ) of our hospital . Here , we report serum anti - SP IgG measured at 6 , 15 , and 28 weeks after BNT162b2 vaccine using SARS - CoV - 2 IgG II Quant kit on an Architect system ( Abbott ) . Fifteen percent of the study population was affected by one of the following diseases : high blood pressure ( 6 . 7 % ) , asthma ( 2 . 2 % ) , dyslipidemia ( 2 . 0 % ) , diabetes ( 1 . 7 % ) , cardiovascular disease ( 0 . 6 % ) , or took steroids ( 1 . 3 % ) . Sixty - ﬁve subjects had Covid - 19 either be - fore , or after starting vaccination , and eventually developed mild symptoms but didn’t require hospitalization . Among them , 28 par - ticipants received only one vaccine dose , which was related to ini - tial Government guidelines in a time context of challenges to the supply chain and belief that a single - dose administration might suﬃce for individuals recovered from prior infection . The time evolution of Ab titer in response to vaccination is shown in Fig . 1 . In a subset of participants ( n = 27 ) in whom we obtained serum samples three weeks after vaccination the resulting anti - SP IgG titer was 1026 [ 384 – 1291 ] ( median , IQ range ) , suggesting that peak immunity occurred approximately at six weeks after vaccina - tion when the Ab titer was 8485 [ 4510 – 14 , 490 ] ( median , IQ range ) . At peak immunity anti - SP IgG titer range was wide , spanning more than two orders of magnitude ( min 141 , max 65 , 667 AU ) . A progressive reduction of anti - SP IgG was observed over time , with a sharp decay at 15 weeks ( − 68 % ) , to reach a residual value of about 18 % at 28 weeks , and the calculated half - life was 3 . 8 months . Anti - SP IgG titer at 15 and 28 weeks highly correlated Abbreviations : SP , Spike Protein ; SARS - CoV - 2 , Severe Acute Respiratory Syn - drome CoronaVirus 2 ; Covid - 19 , Corona Virus Disease 2019 .

Anti - SP IgG titer in study participants as function of vaccination status and Covid - 19 positivity . Participants with incomplete vaccination that resulted positive to Covid - 19 ( n = 28 , red line ) had a lower anti - SP IgG titer at peak immunity ( log transformed value , mean , 95 % CI ) , but not at 28 weeks , compared to participants with full vaccination status ( 2 jabs ) ( n = 614 , green line ) . Among participants with complete vaccination , those with history of Covid - 19 ( n = 37 , blue line ) had higher anti - SP IgG titer at peak vaccination and persistently higher titer throughout the study period compared to Covid - 19 negative ones . with the titer at 6 weeks ( week 15 vs . 6 , rho = 0 . 875 ; week 28 vs . 6 , rho = 0 . 691 ) , indicating that the degree of decay was very de - pendent from the peak immunity value . The proﬁle of anti - SP IgG response as function of vaccination status and / or prior infection is reported in Fig . 2 . On one hand , subjects with prior infection and incomplete vac - cination showed a lower level of anti - SP IgG at peak immunity compared to subjects that were fully vaccinated . On the other hand , among participants that were fully vaccinated , subjects with prior infection showed a consistently higher anti - SP IgG titer at https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . jinf . 2022 . 02 . 013 0163 - 4453 / © 2022 The British Infection Association .

A mixed - effects model was applied to estimate the effect of vaccination status - i . e . , complete / incomplete vaccination and prior infection , along with age , gender , and clinical status on the loga - rithm of anti - SP IgG response . A subject - speciﬁc random intercept was used to consider dependence arising from repeated measures on the same subject . Anti - SP IgG response was signiﬁcantly higher at week 6 com - pared to both week 15 ( β = − 1 . 133 , 95 % CI : − 1 . 179 ; − 1 . 088 , p < 0 . 0 0 01 ) and week 28 ( β = − 1 . 974 , 95 % CI : − 2 . 019 ; − 1 . 928 , p < 0 . 0 0 01 ) , negatively correlated with age ( β − 0 . 011 , 95 % CI : − 0 . 016 ; − 0 . 006 , p < 0 . 0001 ) , and resulted higher in women than in males ( β 0 . 185 , 95 % CI : 0 . 0 6 6 ; 0 . 304 p = 0 . 0025 ) . Meanwhile disease status appeared to have no signiﬁcant effect . In subjects with previous Covid - 19 anti - SP IgG titer was higher in those with full vaccination compared to those with incomplete vaccination ( β 1 . 311 , 95 % CI 0 . 966 – 1 . 656 , p < 0 . 0 0 01 ) ; and was higher in subjects fully vaccinated Covid - 19 negative compared to incom - pletely vaccinated Covid - 19 positive subjects ( β 0 . 338 , 95 % CI 0 . 114 – 0 . 663 , p = 0 . 0058 ) . In this study conducted in vaccinees with mRNA BNT162b2 , we found a wide range in antibody titer at peak immunity , and a substantially waning of antibody titers within 28 weeks of follow up , in agreement with previous data on mRNA vaccines . 1 , 3 Given the challenges derived by the global demand of vac - cines , the need of implementing vaccination status with booster doses , the occurrence of SARS - CoV2 variants with development of new / modiﬁed mRNA vaccines , surrogate markers of vaccine eﬃcacy are highly sought . Our study indicates that the lowest Ab response is observed in subjects with one jab vaccination and prior infection , while the highest Ab response was observed in fully vaccinated subjects with prior infection , whereas fully vacci - nated subjects without infection positioned in the middle . There was , however , a comparable decay rate of antibodies in infected versus non - infected subjects that is in line with a recent report . 4 A recent study on mRNA - 1273 vaccine , reported strong evi - dence that circulating antibodies - including neutralizing and bind - ing antibodies , are directly correlated with vaccine eﬃcacy , and inversely correlated with Covid - 19 risk . 5 Analytical methods for the measurement of anti - SP IgG titer in high throughput settings are already available . Therefore , anti - SP IgG may be used as a surro - gate marker in assessing the status of protection against Covid - 19 disease in the single individual , especially in a supply - limited environment , 1 once appropriate cut - off values and inter - laboratory harmonization are identiﬁed by speciﬁcally addressed studies .
