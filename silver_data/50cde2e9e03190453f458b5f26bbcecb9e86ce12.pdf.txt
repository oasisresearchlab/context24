Abstract 1 Background : In autumn 2020 , many countries , including the Netherlands , are experiencing a second wave 2 of the COVID - 19 pandemic . Health policymakers are struggling with choosing the right mix of measures to 3 keep the COVID - 19 case numbers under control , but still allow a minimum of social and economic activity . 4 The priority to keep schools open is high , but the role of school - based contacts in the epidemiology of SARS - 5 CoV - 2 is incompletely understood . We used a transmission model to estimate the impact of school contacts 6 on transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 and to assess the eﬀects of school - based measures , including school closure , on 7 controlling the pandemic at diﬀerent time points during the pandemic . 8 Methods and Findings : The age - structured model was ﬁtted to age - speciﬁc seroprevalence and hospital 9 admission data from the Netherlands during spring 2020 . Compared to adults older than 60 years , the estimated 10 susceptibility was 23 % ( 95 % CrI 20—28 % ) for children aged 0 to 20 years and 61 % ( 95 % CrI 50 % —72 % ) for the 11 age group of 20 to 60 years . The time points considered in the analyses were ( i ) August 2020 when the eﬀective 12 reproduction number ( R e ) was estimated to be 1 . 31 ( 95 % CrI 1 . 15—2 . 07 ) , schools just opened after the summer 13 holidays and measures were reinforced with the aim to reduce R e to a value below 1 , and ( ii ) November 2020 14 when measures had reduced R e to 1 . 00 ( 95 % CrI 0 . 94—1 . 33 ) . In this period schools remained open . Our model 15 predicts that keeping schools closed after the summer holidays , in the absence of other measures , would have 16 reduced R e by 10 % ( from 1 . 31 to 1 . 18 ( 95 % CrI 1 . 04—1 . 83 ) ) and thus would not have prevented the second wave 17 in autumn 2020 . Reducing non - school - based contacts in August 2020 to the level observed during the ﬁrst wave 18 of the pandemic would have reduced R e to 0 . 83 ( 95 % CrI 0 . 75—1 . 10 ) . Yet , this reduction was not achieved and 19 the observed R e in November was 1 . 00 . Our model predicts that closing schools in November 2020 could reduce 20 R e from the observed value of 1 . 00 to 0 . 84 ( 95 % CrI 0 . 81—0 . 90 ) , with unchanged non - school based contacts . 21 Reductions in R e due to closing schools in November 2020 were 8 % for 10 to 20 years old children , 5 % for 5 to 22 10 years old children and negligible for 0 to 5 years old children . 23 Conclusions : The impact of measures reducing school - based contacts , including school closure , depends on the 24 remaining opportunities to reduce non - school - based contacts . If opportunities to reduce R e with non - school - 25 based measures are exhausted or undesired and R e is still close to 1 , the additional beneﬁt of school - based 26 measures may be considerable , particularly among the older school children . 27 Introduction 28 In autumn 2020 , many countries , including the Netherlands , are experiencing a second wave of the COVID - 19 29 pandemic [ 1 ] . During the ﬁrst wave in spring 2020 , general population - based control physical distancing measures 30 were introduced in the Netherlands , which included refraining from hand - shaking , work from home if possible , self - 31 isolation of persons with cold - or ﬂu - like symptoms and closure of all schools . These contact - reduction measures 32 were relaxed starting from May , and the incidence of COVID - 19 started to increase again at the end of July [ 1 ] . 33 From the end of August onward , contact - reduction measures were reintroduced in a step - wise manner .

Some measures were implemented 36 in schools after the summer break to reduce transmission . Students and teachers in secondary schools have to wear 37 masks when not seated at their desks , and students have to keep distance from teachers . A student with cold - or 38 ﬂu - like symptoms has to stay at home . 39 The step - wise increase in control measures after the summer started with earlier closing times of bars and restaurants , 40 reinforcement of working at home ( in September ) , followed by closure of all bars and restaurants , theaters , cinemas 41 and other cultural meeting places in November and obligatory mask wearing in all public places since December 1 . 42 Estimated eﬀective reproduction numbers ( R e ) were about 1 . 3 at the end of August and about 1 . 0 since November 43 13th [ 1 ] . The aim of the implemented measures was to reduce R e to 0 . 8 . The failure to achieve this might be due to 44 reduced societal acceptance of control measures , and / or due to the lack of schools closure . The role of children and 45 their contacts during school hours in the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 is in fact not well understood [ 2 ] . In this study , 46 we explored this role with a mathematical model ﬁtted to COVID - 19 data from the Netherlands . 47 Closure of schools is considered an eﬀective strategy to contain an inﬂuenza pandemic [ 3 ] , based on both model 48 calculations and observational studies of the inﬂuence of school holidays on the spread of inﬂuenza [ 4 , 5 ] . The 49 reasons for this are the high contact rates in young age groups [ 6 ] and the susceptibility of children and young 50 people to the inﬂuenza virus . In contrast to inﬂuenza , children seem to be less susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 than 51 adults and , based on sparse data , the susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 increases with age [ 7 , 8 ] . 52 In the absence of empirical SARS - CoV - 2 data , mathematical modeling can help to quantify the role of diﬀerent 53 age groups in the distribution of SARS - CoV - 2 in the population [ 9 ] , and to evaluate the impact of interventions 54 on transmission [ 10 – 13 ] . Such models can estimate the reduction in the eﬀective reproduction number for diﬀerent 55 contact - reduction scenarios within or outside school environments . Model predictions about the relative epidemic 56 impacts of school - and non - school - based measures can assist policymakers to select sets of measures during diﬀerent 57 stages of the pandemic that optimally balance potential harms and beneﬁts . Predictions generated by models that 58 include diﬀerences in susceptibility and contract rates in diﬀerent age groups can also aid in deciding which school 59 age groups should be the primary target of school - based interventions . 60 We used an age - structured transmission model for SARS - CoV - 2 ﬁtted to the number of hospital admissions due 61 to COVID - 19 and seroprevalence during spring 2020 in the Netherlands to evaluate the impact of reducing school 62 and other ( non - school - related ) contacts in society to control the second wave of COVID - 19 in the autumn of 2020 . 63 We provide a comparative impact of these measures on the eﬀective reproduction number in August 2020 , before 64 the most recent set of measures was implemented , and in November 2020 , when the most recent measures were 65 still in place . We assess which combinations of school and non - school related measures are most likely successful 66 in reducing the reproduction number to below 1 and which school ages should be targeted to design eﬀective 67 school - based interventions . 68 3 .

The model equipped with parameter estimates was subsequently used to investigate the impact of 73 school - and non - school - based measures on controlling the pandemic . 74 Data 75 The hospital data included n = 10 , 961 COVID - 19 hospitalizations by date of admission and stratiﬁed by age during 76 the period of 69 days following the ﬁrst oﬃcial case in the Netherlands ( 27 February 2020 ) . 77 The SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence data was taken from a cross - sectional population - based serological study carried 78 out in April - May 2020 [ 14 ] . A total of 40 municipalities were randomly selected from the Netherlands , with 79 probabilities proportional to their population size . From these municipalities , an age - stratiﬁed sample was drawn 80 from the population register , and 6 , 102 persons were invited to participate . Serum samples and questionnaires were 81 obtained from 3 , 207 participants and included in the analyses . The majority of blood samples were drawn in the 82 ﬁrst week of April . 83 Our analyses made use of the demographic composition of the Dutch population in July 2020 from Statistics 84 Netherlands [ 15 ] and age - stratiﬁed contact data for the Netherlands [ 16 , 17 ] . The contact rates before the pandemic 85 were based on a cross - sectional survey carried out in 2016 / 2017 , where participants reported the number and age of 86 their contacts during the previous day [ 16 ] . The contact rates after the ﬁrst lockdown were based on the same survey 87 which was repeated in a sub - sample of the participants in April 2020 ( PIENTER Corona study ) [ 16 ] . School - speciﬁc 88 contact rates for the Dutch population before the pandemic were taken from the POLYMOD study [ 6 , 17 ] . 89 Transmission model 90 We used a deterministic compartmental model describing SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in a population stratiﬁed by 91 infection status and age ( Figure 1 A ) . The dynamics of the model follows the Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - 92 Recovered structure . Persons in age group k , where k = 1 , . . . , n , are classiﬁed as susceptible ( S k ) , infected but not 93 yet infectious ( exposed , E k ) , infectious in m stages ( I k , p , where p = 1 , . . . , m ) , hospitalized ( H k ) and recovered 94 without hospitalization ( R k ) . Susceptible persons ( S k ) can acquire infection via contact with infectious persons 95 ( I k , p ) and become latently infected ( E k ) at a rate β k λ k , where λ k is the force of infection , and β k is the reduction 96 in susceptibility to infection of persons in age group k compared to persons in age group n . After the latent period 97 ( duration 1 / α days ) , exposed persons become infectious ( I k , 1 ) . Infectious persons progress through ( m − 1 ) stages 98 of infection ( I k , p , where p = 2 , . . . , m ) at rate γm , after which they recover ( R k ) . Inclusion of m identical infectious 99 4 .

Intermediate values of m correspond 101 to an Erlang - distributed infectious period with mean 1 / γ and standard deviation 1 / [ γ √ m ] . Hospitalization ( H k ) 102 of infectious persons ( I k , p ) occurs at rate ν k . Since the model is ﬁt to hospital admissions data , the disease - related 103 mortality and discharge from the hospital are not explicitly modeled . Given the timescale of the pandemic and the 104 lack of reliable data on reinfections , we assume that recovered individuals cannot be reinfected . As the timescale of 105 the pandemic is short compared to the average lifespan of persons , we neglected natural birth and death processes , 106 and the population size in the model stays constant . 107 We assume that , before the ﬁrst lockdown , the probability of transmission per contact between a susceptible and an 108 infectious individual , (cid:15) , is independent of the age of two individuals . After introduction of the control measures in 109 March 2020 , this probability of transmission decreased to (cid:15)ζ 1 , where 0 ≤ ζ 1 ≤ 1 . ( 1 − ζ 1 ) then denotes the reduction 110 in the probability of transmission due to general population - based measures that are not explicitly included in the 111 model , such as refraining from shaking hands , physical distancing , mask - wearing , and self - isolation of symptomatic 112 persons . We denote the general contact rate of a person in age group k with persons in age group l , c kl , and the 113 contact rates speciﬁc to the periods before and after the ﬁrst lockdown , b kl , and , a kl , respectively ( see Figures 1 B 114 and C ) . We model the transition in the general contact rate using a linear combination 115 c kl = [ 1 − f ( t ) ] b kl + ζ 1 f ( t ) a kl , ( 1 ) 116 where the contribution of the contact rate after the ﬁrst lockdown is given by the logistic function 117 f ( t ) = 1 1 + e − K 1 ( t − t 1 ) ( 2 ) 118 with the mid - point value t 1 and the logistic growth K 1 . The parameter K 1 governs the speed at which control 119 measures are rolled out , and t 1 is the mid - time point of the lockdown period ( Figure S1 ) . The special cases of 120 f = 0 and f = 1 describe the contact rate before and after the ﬁrst lockdown , with f values between 0 and 1 121 corresponding to contact rates at the intermediate time points . 122 Similarly , the contact rate incorporating the relaxation of control measures after the ﬁrst lockdown is modeled as 123 follows 124 c kl = ζ 1 g ( t ) a kl + [ 1 − g ( t ) ] ζ 2 ( b kl − s kl ) + ωs kl , ( 3 ) 125 where g ( t ) = 1 / (cid:2) 1 + e K 2 ( t − t 2 ) (cid:3) with the mid - point value t 2 > t 1 and the logistic growth K 2 . In Eq . 3 , the ﬁrst two 126 terms describe the increase of non - school contacts from the level after the ﬁrst lockdown to their pre - lockdown level . 127 The parameter ζ 2 ≥ ζ 1 , 0 ≤ ζ 2 ≤ 1 implies that the probability of transmission increased due to reduced adherence 128 to control measures . The last term describes opening of schools which we assume to happen instantaneously , where 129 6 .

We took 22 February 145 2020 as starting date ( t 0 ) for the pandemic in the Netherlands , which is 5 days prior to the ﬁrst oﬃcially notiﬁed 146 case . We assumed that there were no hospitalizations during this 5 day period . As initial condition for the model , 147 we assume that a fraction θ of each age group was infected at time t 0 , equally distributed between the exposed and 148 infectious persons , i . e . , E k ( t 0 ) = 12 θN k , I k , p ( t 0 ) = 12 m θN k and S k ( t 0 ) = ( 1 − θ ) N k . 149 The model was implemented in Mathematica 10 . 0 . 2 . 0 . The code reproducing the results of this study is available 150 at https : / / github . com / lynxgav / COVID19 - schools . 151 Observation model and parameter estimation 152 Given predictions of the model , we calculated the likelihood of the data as follows . In the model , infectious 153 individuals are hospitalized at a continuous rate ν k (cid:80) mp = 1 I k , p . However , the hospitalization data consists of a 154 discrete number of hospital admissions h k , i on day T i for each age class k . As the probability of hospitalization 155 is relatively small , we made the simplifying assumption that the daily incidence of hospitalizations is proportional 156 to the prevalence of infectious individuals at that time point . To accommodate errors in reporting and within age 157 class variability of the hospitalization rate , we allowed for over - dispersion in the number of hospitalizations using a 158 Negative - Binomial distribution , i . e . , 159 h k , i ∼ NegBinom (cid:16) ν k (cid:80) mp = 1 I k , p ( T i ) , r (cid:17) , ( 6 ) 160 where we parameterize the NegBinom ( µ , r ) distribution with the mean µ and over - dispersion parameter r , such 161 that the variance is equal to µ + µ 2 / r . 162 We calculated the likelihood of the seroprevalence data using the model prediction of the fraction of non - susceptible 163 individuals in each age class 1 − S k ( T ) / N k . Here T denotes the median sampling time minus the expected duration 164 from infection to seroconversion . We assumed that the probability of ﬁnding a seropositive individual in a random 165 sample from the population is equal to the fraction of non - susceptible individuals , leading to a Binomial distribution 166 for the number of positive samples (cid:96) k among all samples L k from age group k 167 (cid:96) k ∼ Binom ( L k , 1 − S k ( T ) / N k ) .

Due to the low number of hospitalizations in young persons , we assumed that hospitalization 172 rates in the ﬁrst three age groups ( i . e . , [ 0 , 20 ) years old ) were equal . The relative susceptibility was estimated for 173 persons in [ 0 , 20 ) , [ 20 , 60 ) and 60 + age categories , where 60 + age category was used as the reference [ 7 ] . As the age 174 groups for which the seroprevalence was reported [ 14 ] are diﬀerent from the age groups used in our model , we used 175 demographic data from the Netherlands [ 15 ] and the smoothed age - speciﬁc seroprevalence curve estimated by Vos et 176 al . [ 14 ] to correct for this discrepancy . The Bayesian prior distributions for the estimated parameters ( see Table 1 ) 177 are listed in Table 2 . In the main text , we presented results for three infectious classes ( m = 3 ) corresponding to 178 Erlang - distributed infectious periods . The model was ﬁtted to the data using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method 179 as implemented in Stan ( https : / / www . mc - stan . org ) [ 21 ] . We used 4 parallel chains of length 1500 with a warm - up 180 phase of length 1000 , resulting in 2000 parameter samples from the posterior distribution .

The number of hospitalizations increases with age , with the highest peaks in hospitalizations observed in persons 191 above 60 years old . The estimated probability of hospitalization increases nearly exponentially with age ( as shown 192 by an approximately linear relationship on the logarithmic scale , Figure 3 ) , except for persons under 30 years old , 193 in whom the number of hospitalizations was low . The estimated probability of hospitalization increased from 0 . 09 % 194 ( 95 % CrI 0 . 05—0 . 15 % ) in persons under 20 years old to 4 . 37 % ( 95 % CrI 2 . 80—8 . 82 % ) in persons older than 80 years 195 ( Figure S2 ) . 196 Figure 2 .

The dark gray lines correspond to 95 % credible intervals obtained from 2000 parameter samples from the posterior distribution , and the shaded region shows 95 % Bayesian prediction intervals . The dots are daily hospitalization admission data . The model accurately reproduces the percentage of seropositive persons distributed across the age groups ( Figure 197 4 ) . The median seroprevalence in the population was 2 . 7 % , with the maximum seroprevalence observed in persons 198 between 20 and 40 years old ( about 3 . 5 % ) . The lowest seroprevalence was among children in the 0 to 10 years 199 age group ( 0 . 9 % ) . Note that if our model did not include age - dependence of susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 , the 200 seroprevalence peak would be expected among children because they have the largest numbers of contacts in the 201 population . 202 The estimated probability of transmission per contact was 0 . 07 ( 95 % CrI 0 . 05—0 . 12 ) before the ﬁrst lockdown and 203 it decreased by 48 . 84 % ( 95 % CrI 23 . 81—87 . 44 % ) after the ﬁrst lockdown . The reduction in susceptibility relative 204 to susceptibility in persons above 60 years old was 23 % ( 95 % CrI 20—28 % ) in persons under 20 years old and 61 % 205 10 .

The estimated basic reproduction number 206 was 2 . 71 ( 95 % CrI 2 . 15—5 . 18 ) in the absence of control measures ( February 2020 ) ( Figure S4 A ) , and dropped to 207 0 . 62 ( 95 % CrI 0 . 29—0 . 74 ) after the full lockdown ( April 2020 ) ( Figure S4 B ) .

School and non - school based measures 210 The sequence of measures implemented and lifted during the pandemic in the Netherlands and the respective 211 estimated values of the eﬀective reproduction numbers are shown schematically in Figure 5 . We used the ﬁtted 212 model to separately determine the eﬀect on the eﬀective reproduction number of decreasing contacts in schools and 213 of decreasing other ( non - school - related ) contacts in society in August 2020 ( Figure 6 ) and November 2020 ( Figure 214 7 ) . In doing so , we varied one type of contact and kept the other type constant . For each scenario , the reduction 215 in contact rate was varied between 0 % and 100 % . The aim of reducing the number of contacts of each type is to 216 decrease the eﬀective reproduction number below 1 . 217 We ﬁrst considered the situation in August 2020 ( Figure 6 ) , when schools had just opened after the summer holidays 218 and when general control measures in the population were less stringent than in April ( full lockdown ) .

We therefore 222 assumed that the eﬀective number of contacts in schools was the same as before the pandemic ( ω = 1 ) . For the 223 non - school related contacts we assumed that 1 ) the number of contacts increased after April 2020 ( full lockdown ) 224 but was lower than before the pandemic , and that 2 ) the transmission probability per contact was lower due to 225 general physical distancing and hygiene measures . The starting point of our analyses is an eﬀective reproduction 226 number of 1 . 31 ( 95 % CrI 1 . 15—2 . 07 ) in accordance with the situation in August 2020 ( Figure S4 C ) . Speciﬁcally , to 227 achieve R e = 1 . 31 we ﬁxed ζ 2 at 0 . 67 ( decrease in adherence to contact - reduction measures in August as compared 228 to April , when ζ 1 is estimated at 0 . 51 ) and g at 0 . 5 ( half - way in the relaxation of non - school contacts ) . 229 Assuming the state of the Dutch pandemic in August 2020 , Figure 6 A demonstrates that non - school related contacts 230 would have to be reduced by at least 50 % to bring the eﬀective reproduction number to 1 ( if school related contacts 231 do not change ) . A 100 % reduction would resemble the number of contacts in April ( full lockdown ) and would bring 232 the eﬀective reproduction number to 0 . 83 ( 95 % CrI 0 . 75—1 . 10 ) . Figure 6 B demonstrates that reductions of school 233 contacts would have a limited impact on the eﬀective reproduction number ( if non - school contacts do not change ) . 234 A 100 % reduction ( complete closure of schools ) would have reduced the eﬀective reproduction number by only 10 % 235 ( from 1 . 31 to 1 . 18 ( 95 % CrI 1 . 04—1 . 83 ) ) . 236 Figure 6 .

Now , the impact of interventions targeted at reducing school contacts ( Figure 240 7 B ) would reduce the eﬀective reproduction number similarly as reducing non - school contacts in the rest of the 241 population ( Figure 7 A ) . Speciﬁcally , closing schools would reduce the eﬀective reproduction number by 16 % ( from 242 1 . 0 to 0 . 84 ( 95 % CrI 0 . 81—0 . 90 ) ) ( Figure 7 B ) . Almost the same R e , i . e . , 0 . 83 ( 95 % CrI 0 . 75—1 . 10 ) , would have been 243 achieved by reducing non - school related contacts to the level of April 2020 while the schools remain open ( Figure 244 7 A ) . 245 Figure 7 .

Interventions for diﬀerent school ages 246 Next we investigated the impact of targeting interventions at diﬀerent age groups , starting from the situation in 247 November 2020 with the eﬀective reproduction number being 1 ( Figure S4 D ) . Figure 8 A , B , and C show R e as 248 a function of the reduction of school contacts in age groups of [ 0 , 5 ) , [ 5 , 10 ) and [ 10 , 20 ) y . o . , respectively . In each 249 panel , we varied the number of school contacts in one age group while keeping the number of school contacts in the 250 other two age groups constant . 0 % reduction corresponds to the situation in November 2020 , and 100 % reduction 251 represents a scenario with schools for students in a given age group closed .

Closing schools for this age group only 253 could decrease R e by about 8 % ( compare Figure 8 C and Figure 7 B where we expect the reduction of 16 % after 254 closing schools for all ages ) . Schools closure for children aged 5 to 10 years would reduce R e by about 5 % ( Figure 8 255 B ) . Contact reductions among 0 to 5 year old children would have negligible impact on R e as shown in Figure 8 A . 256 Figure 8 .

In each panel , we varied the number of school contacts in one age group while keeping the number of school contacts in the other two age groups constant . The scenario with 0 % reduction describes the situation in November 2020 with R e of about 1 ( partial lockdown intended to prevent the second wave ) , where all schools are open without substantial additional measures . The reduction of 100 % in school contacts represents a scenario with the structure of non - school contacts as in November 2020 and schools for students in a given age group closed .

The red line is the starting value of R e = 1 ( situation November 2020 ) . The green line indicates the value of R e achieved when schools for a given age group close . Discussion 257 We used an age - structured model for SARS - CoV - 2 ﬁtted to hospital admission and seroprevalence data during spring 258 2020 to estimate the impact of school contacts on transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 and to assess the eﬀects of school - 259 based measures , including schools closure , to mitigate the second wave in the autumn of 2020 . We demonstrate how 260 the relative impact of school - based measures aimed at reduction of contacts at schools on the eﬀective reproduction 261 number increases when the eﬀects of non - school - based measures appear to be insuﬃcient . These ﬁndings underscore 262 the dilemma for policymakers of choosing between stronger enforcement of population - wide measures to reduce non - 263 school - based contacts or measures that reduce school - based contacts , including complete closure of schools . For the 264 latter choice , our model predicts highest impact from measures implemented for the oldest school ages . We used the 265 Netherlands as a case example but our model code is freely available and can be readily adapted to other countries 266 given the availability of hospitalization and seroprevalence data . The ﬁndings in our manuscript can be relevant for 267 guiding policy decisions in the Netherlands , but also in countries where the contact structure in the population is 268 similar to that of the Netherlands [ 6 ] . 269 15 .

The model has been carefully validated to achieve an excellent ﬁt to data 271 of daily hospitalizations due to COVID - 19 and seroprevalence by age . Furthermore , reproduction numbers at 272 diﬀerent time points of the pandemic correlated well with estimates obtained from independent sources [ 1 ] . Finally , 273 susceptibility to infection with SARS - CoV - 2 was estimated to increase with age , which corroborates published 274 ﬁndings [ 7 , 8 ] . Compared to adults older than 60 years , the estimated susceptibility was about 20 % for children aged 275 0 to 20 years and about 60 % for the age group of 20 to 60 years . However , even with extensive validation , we need to 276 be careful when interpreting the predictions of our model as these depend on the sensitivity of serology to identify 277 individuals with prior infection . Recent studies suggest that in persons who experience mild or asymptomatic 278 infections , SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies may not always be detectable post - infection [ 23 , 24 ] . 279 Naturally , our ﬁndings result from age - related diﬀerences in disease susceptibility and contact structure . Despite 280 high numbers of contacts for children of all ages , and in particular in the age group of 10 to 20 years old , closing 281 schools appeared to have much less impact on the eﬀective reproduction number than physical distancing measures 282 outside the school environment . In fact , measures eﬀectively reducing non - school contacts , similar to those measures 283 implemented in response to the ﬁrst pandemic wave in spring 2020 , could have prevented a second wave in autumn 284 without school closures . With an estimated eﬀective reproduction number of 1 . 3 in August 2020 , continuation of 285 school closures would have had much lower eﬀects than measures aiming to reduce non - school related contacts , 286 which mainly occur in the adult population . Yet , that situation changes if the proposed measures fail . In November 287 2020 , the measures implemented since August had reduced the eﬀective reproduction number to around 1 , instead 288 of achieving the target value of about 0 . 8 . In that situation , as our ﬁndings demonstrate , additional physical 289 distancing measures in schools could assist in reducing the eﬀective reproduction number further , in particular 290 when implemented in secondary schools . Our analyses suggest that physical distancing measures in the youngest 291 children will have no impact on the control of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Of note , better adherence to non - school based 292 measures would still have similar eﬀects as reducing school - based contacts . 293 Although there are several options for reducing the number of contacts between children at school , such as staggered 294 start and end times and breaks , diﬀerent forms of physical distancing for pupils and division of classes , the eﬀects 295 of such measures on transmission among children have not been quantiﬁed . Importantly , we have assumed that 296 reductions in school - based contacts are not replaced by non - school - based contacts with similar transmission risk . 297 Our modelling approach has several limitations . For estimating disease susceptibility we could only model children 298 as group of 0 to 20 years old . As disease susceptibility increases with age , it seems obvious that eﬀects of reduced 299 school contacts are most prominent in older children . Assuming equal susceptibility across these ages may have 300 underestimated to some extent the eﬀect of reducing school contacts for children between 10 and 20 years . At the 301 same time , we assumed that school contact patterns in August - November 2020 reﬂect the pre - pandemic situation . 302 Yet , universal control measures in the Netherlands such as stay at home orders for symptomatic persons probably 303 16 .

Eﬀects of these measures in school settings should be smaller than in 305 the general population and are hard to estimate due to a large number of asymptomatic cases among children , and 306 therefore were not taken into account . In this respect , the results reported here describe the maximum possible 307 reduction in the eﬀective reproduction number due to school interventions . Furthermore , the contact matrices 308 available did not allow diﬀerentiation between various types of contacts outside schools ( like work , leisure , transport 309 etc . ) , as these were not available for periods during the pandemic . Therefore , we could not model the impact of 310 reducing work - related or leisure - related contacts separately . We also could not include hospitalization data from 311 the second wave of the pandemic due to lack of data availability . 312 The potential eﬀects of opening or closing schools in diﬀerent phases of the pandemic have been reported in other 313 studies [ 11 , 25 – 30 ] . Also based on a mathematical model , Panovska - Griﬃths et al . [ 25 ] predicted that without 314 very high levels of testing and contact tracing reopening schools after summer with a simultaneous relaxation of 315 measures will lead to a second wave in the United Kingdom , peaking in December 2020 . Their model predicted 316 that this peak could be postponed for two months ( to February 2021 ) by a rotating timetable in schools . Very early 317 in the pandemic , in March 2020 , the Scientiﬁc Advisory Group for Emergencies in the United Kingdom , concluded 318 that it would not be possible to get the eﬀective reproduction number below 1 without closing schools [ 26 ] . In a 319 modelling study on the impact of non - pharmaceutical interventions for COVID - 19 in the United Kingdom , Davies 320 et al . found that the impact of school closures was low [ 11 ] . In another modeling study Rice et al . [ 30 ] found that 321 school closures during the ﬁrst wave of the pandemic could increase overall mortality , due to death being postponed 322 to a second wave . And based on an analysis of the impact of non - pharmaceutical measures in 41 countries between 323 January and May 2020 , Brauner et al . [ 27 ] concluded that closure of schools and universities had contributed the 324 most to lowering the eﬀective reproduction number . Yet , a major diﬃculty in estimating the eﬀect of school closure 325 based on observational data from the ﬁrst wave is that other non - pharmaceutical interventions were implemented 326 at or around the same time as school closures [ 31 ] . Similarly , lifting such measures often coincided with school 327 re - openings . Observational data from the period after the ﬁrst wave show conﬂicting results on within school 328 transmission [ 32 – 35 ] and the eﬀect of school reopening and interpretation is further hampered by the variety in 329 control measures implemented in schools across countries . Finally , Munday et al . showed that reopening secondary 330 schools is likely to have a greater impact on community transmission than reopening primary schools in England [ 28 ] . 331 While the modelling approach of [ 28 ] is diﬀerent from ours , our ﬁndings are similar in the sense that secondary 332 schools are predicted to make a larger contribution to transmission than primary schools , and are therefore more 333 important for controlling COVID - 19 . 334 In conclusion , we have demonstrated that the potential eﬀects of school - based measures to reduce contacts between 335 children , including school closures , markedly depends on the reduction in the eﬀective reproduction number achieved 336 by other measures . With remaining opportunities to reduce the eﬀective reproduction number with non - school - 337 17 .

Yet , if opportunities to reduce the eﬀective 338 reproduction number with non - school - based measures are considered to be exhausted or undesired for economic 339 reasons and R e is still close to 1 , the additional beneﬁt of school - based measures may be considerable . In such 340 situations , the biggest impact on transmission is achieved by reducing contacts in secondary schools . 341 Acknowledgements 342 The contribution of CHvD was under the auspices of the US Department of Energy ( contract number 343 89233218CNA000001 ) and supported by the National Institutes of Health ( grant number R01 - OD011095 ) .

Contribution of the contact rate after the ﬁrst lockdown . We model the transition in the general contact rate , c kl , as follows c kl = [ 1 − f ( t ) ] b kl + ζ 1 f ( t ) a kl , where f is the contribution of the contact rate after the ﬁrst lockdown , b kl and a kl are the contact rates speciﬁc to the periods before and after the ﬁrst lockdown . f is a logistic function with parameters K 1 and t 1 governing the speed and mid - way of lockdown roll - out .
