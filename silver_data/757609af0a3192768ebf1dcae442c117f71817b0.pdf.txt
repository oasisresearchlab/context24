Since basolateral targeting signals are found in a Cancer Research Institute Kanazawa University membrane protein’s cytoplasmic domain , it seems likely that they will be recognized by a cytosolic protein or 13 - 1 Takaramachi Kanazawa 920 - 0934 protein complex . Indeed , for that subset of proteins which are localized at the basolateral surface due to Japan the presence of a cytoplasmic tail PDZ - binding domain , interaction with cytosolic PDZ proteins has been found essential to ensure polarity . However , PDZ interactions Summary seem to be important for selective retention after arrival at the basolateral surface as opposed to sorting into Although polarized epithelial cells are well known to maintain distinct apical and basolateral plasma mem - transport vesicles at the level of the TGN ( Cohen et al . , 1998 ) . brane domains , the mechanisms responsible for tar - geting membrane proteins to the apical or basolateral In the case of the more common tyrosine - dependent basolateral sorting signals , a role for clathrin adaptor surfaces have remained elusive . We have identified a novel form of the AP - 1 clathrin adaptor complex that complexes has seemed a possibility , although no direct evidence has yet emerged . It is well established that contains as one of its subunits (cid:109) 1B , an epithelial cell - specific homolog of the ubiquitously expressed (cid:109) 1A . tyrosine - based and dileucine - based sorting signals in - volved in endocytosis and lysosomal targeting are rec - LLC - PK1 kidney epithelial cells do not express (cid:109) 1B and missort many basolateral proteins to the apical ognized by one or more heterotetrameric adaptor com - plexes AP - 1 ( (cid:103) , (cid:98) 1 , (cid:109) 1 , (cid:115) 1 ) , AP - 2 ( (cid:97) , (cid:98) 2 , (cid:109) 2 , (cid:115) 2 ) , and surface .

A fourth related complex , tion of LLC - PK1 monolayers , and had no effect on apical targeting . We conclude that basolateral sorting AP - 4 ( (cid:101) , (cid:98) 4 , (cid:109) 4 , (cid:115) 4 ) , has recently been described ( Dell’ Angelica et al . , 1999a ; Hirst et al . , 1999 ) . AP - 2 mediates is mediated by an epithelial cell - specific version of the AP - 1 complex containing (cid:109) 1B . endocytosis from the plasma membrane , while AP - 1 , AP - 3 , and AP - 4 are thought to mediate sorting at the TGN and / or endosomal membranes . Interaction be - Introduction tween the adaptor complexes and tyrosine - based sort - ing signals is mediated by the (cid:109) subunits ( Ohno et al . , The plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells is 1995 , 1996 ) , while dileucine signals may interact with differentiated into apical and basolateral domains , each the (cid:98) subunits ( Rapoport et al . , 1998 ) . with distinctive sets of proteins and lipids ( Rodriguez - We have recently identified a closely related ( 79 % Boulan and Powell , 1992 ; Drubin and Nelson , 1996 ; Yea - identity at the amino acid level ) isoform of the (cid:109) 1 subunit man et al . , 1999 ) . Sorting of newly synthesized plasma of AP - 1 whose expression is limited to cells of epithelial membrane proteins typically occurs in the trans - Golgi origin ( Ohno et al . , 1999 ) . mRNA for the new protein , network ( TGN ) , where apical and basolateral compo - designated (cid:109) 1B to distinguish it from the ubiquitously nents are selectively packaged into specific transport expressed (cid:109) 1A , was found to be expressed in various vesicles . The basic logic of polarized sorting is well polarized epithelial cell lines , including MDCK , Caco - 2 , known andinvolves a hierarchical interplaybetween two HT - 29 , Hec - 1 - A , and RL - 95 - 2 cells .

Sorting of LDL Receptor in MDCK Cells and LLC - PK1 Cells MDCK cells ( A ) or LLC - PK1 cells ( B ) were grown on Transwell filters and infected with recombinant adenoviruses for 1 hr and cul - tured for 2 days to allow for the expression of LDL receptor .

To confirm the specificity of these anti - bodies , they were tested by Western blot analysis containing AP - 1 complex plays a critical role in basolat - eral targeting . against recombinant (cid:109) 1A and (cid:109) 1B protein produced in E . coli . As shown in Figure 2B , an antibody previously generated against (cid:109) 1A reacted well with both (cid:109) 1A and Results (cid:109) 1B . The new anti - peptide antibodies , however , were specific for (cid:109) 1B . The C - terminal peptide antibody was LDL Receptor Is Basolateral in MDCK Cells and Apical in LLC - PK1 Cells subsequently used for detection of (cid:109) 1B expression in LLC - PK1 transfectants . To determine whether (cid:109) 1B plays a role in polarized sort - ing , we first compared the localization of the LDL recep - Nontransfected LLC - PK1 cells and cloned LLC - PK1 tor in (cid:109) 1B - positive MDCK cells and (cid:109) 1B - negative LLC - PK1 cells . The LDL receptor is well known to localize to the basolateral plasma membrane domain of MDCK cellsbyvirtueofsignals containedwithinitscytoplasmic tail ( Matter et al . , 1992 , 1994 ) . Expression was achieved byinfectingpolarizedcellsgrownonfilterswitharecom - binant adenovirus encoding the receptor ( adLDLR ) . Two days after infection , the cells were immunola - beled , fixed , and analyzed by confocal microscopy . In the MDCK cells , LDL receptor was detected only at the basolateral surfaces , independently ofexpression levels ( Figure 1A ) . This was already apparent in X - Y confocal sections ( upper panel ) , where the marginal outlines of expressing cells were stained . Basolateral localization was confirmed in vertical ( X - Z ) optical sections , where expressing cells displayed LDL receptor at the lateral and basal , but not the apical , plasma membrane do - mains ( Figure 1A , lower panel ) . These control experi - ments with MDCK cells demonstrated that virus infec - tion did not interfere with polarized expression of the LDL receptor . An entirely different picture was obtained for infected LLC - PK1 cells , however ( Figure 1B ) . In these cells , LDL receptor was found only at the apical surface regardless of expression level . This is the same pheno - Figure 2 .

Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS – PAGE and immunoblotting using anti - (cid:98) 1 / 2 - adaptin antibodies ( clone 100 / 1 ) , anti - (cid:103) - adaptin antibodies ( clone 100 / 3 , Sigma ) , (cid:109) 1A / B cross - reacting antibodies , and (cid:109) 1B - specific antibodies raised against the C terminus of (cid:109) 1B .

AP - 1 complex was precipitated using anti - (cid:103) - adaptin antibodies ( clone 100 / 3 ) . The precipitates were boiled in SDS buffer , and one - fourth was directly subjected to SDS – PAGE analysis . The remaining extract was diluted in lysis buffer , and subunits of the AP - 1 complex were recaptured usingpreimmuneantibodies , anti - (cid:103) - adaptinantibodies ( clone100 / 3 ) , oranti - (cid:109) 1BantibodiesdirectedagainsttheCterminusof (cid:109) 1B .

LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1B transfectants were lysed in Triton X - 100 buffer and subjected to gel filtration analysis as described in Experimental Procedures . The proteins (cid:97) - adaptin ( subunit of AP - 2 ) , (cid:103) - adaptin ( subunit of AP - 1 ) , (cid:98) 4 ( subunit of AP - 4 ) , (cid:115) 3 ( subunit of AP - 3 ) , and (cid:109) 1B were detected in the eluate fractions by Western blotting and immunolabeling using subunit - specific antibodies . cells transfected with (cid:109) 1A cDNA ( LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1A ) or with in nontransfected LLC - PK1 or LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1A transfec - tants ( Figure 2C , lanes 1 – 6 ) . Although only one repre - (cid:109) 1B cDNA ( LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1B ) were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting . Both the parental and transfected cell sentative clone of LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1A and LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1B is shown , analysis of several independently isolated lines were found to express equivalent amounts of (cid:103) - adaptin , one of the large subunits of AP - 1 ( Figure 2C ) . clones yielded essentially the same results . The cross - reacting anti - (cid:109) 1A antibody revealed a slight increase of total (cid:109) 1 levels in both LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1A ( Figure (cid:109) 1B Is an Alternative Subunit of the AP - 1 Adaptor Complex 2C , lanes 4 – 6 ) and LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1B transfectants ( Figure 2C , lanes 7 – 9 ) as compared to the nontransfected LLC - Since (cid:109) 1A and (cid:109) 1B are highly homologous ( 79 % identity at the amino acid level ) ( Ohno et al . , 1999 ) , it seemed PK1 cells ( Figure 2C , lanes 1 – 3 ) . In both cases , the in - creases were 2 - to 4 - fold relative to endogenous (cid:109) 1A . likely that (cid:109) 1B might be a component of the ubiquitously expressed AP - 1 complex . To determine whether this Finally , the (cid:109) 1B - specific antibody confirmed (cid:109) 1B ex - pression only in LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1B transfectants ( Figure 2C , was the case , we immunoprecipitated AP - 1 from LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1A transfectants or LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1B transfectants lanes 7 – 9 , lower panel ) . Virtually no signal was detected Cell192 using anti - (cid:103) - adaptin antibodies . As shown in Figure 3A , anti - (cid:103) - adaptin antibodies coprecipitated (cid:103) - adaptin , (cid:98) 1 , and (cid:109) 1A from lysates of LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1A cells ( Figure 3A , lane 2 ) . When cell lysate from LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1B transfec - tants was used , (cid:109) 1B was also coimmunoprecipitated ( Figure 3A , lane 3 ) . To further prove that (cid:109) 1B is a subunit of an AP - 1 complex , we next metabolically labeled LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1B cells with [ 35 S ] methionine / cysteine . Cells were lysed , andimmunoprecipitations usinganti - (cid:103) - adaptinantibod - ies were performed . The primary coimmunoprecipitate was then boiled in SDS to dissociate the AP - 1 complex . The boiled extract was diluted in lysis buffer and used for a second round of immunoprecipitations using either anti - (cid:103) or anti - (cid:109) 1B antibodies . As shown in Figure 3B , total immunoprecipitates con - tained labeled bands corresponding to each of the four expected AP - 1 subunits : (cid:98) 1 , (cid:103) , (cid:109) 1A or (cid:109) 1B , and (cid:115) 1 ( Figure3B , lane2 ) . Inthesecondprecipitationofdissoci - ated subunits , anti - (cid:103) - adaptin antibodies precipitated only (cid:103) - adaptin ( Figure 3B , lane 4 ) , while antibodies to the C - terminal (cid:109) 1B peptide precipitated only (cid:109) 1B ( Fig - ure 3B , lane 5 ) ; (cid:109) 1B could also be recaptured using the antibodyagainsttheNterminusof (cid:109) 1B ( datanotshown ) . Thesedata stronglysuggest that (cid:109) 1B becomesincorpo - rated into an AP - 1 complex in the (cid:109) 1B transfectants . When LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1A transfectants were used for this experiment , (cid:109) 1B could not be precipitated in the second round ( data not shown ) . Figure 4 . AP - 1B Mediates Basolateral Sorting of LDL Receptor and Tfn Receptor To exclude the possibility that (cid:109) 1B also assembled into other known adaptor complexes ( i . e . , AP - 2 , AP - 3 , LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1A transfectants ( left panels ) or LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1B transfec - tants ( right panels ) were grown on Transwell filters for 4 days and or AP - 4 ) , we performed gel filtration chromatography infected with recombinant adenoviruses for 1 hr and cultured for 2 on cytosol from LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1B transfectants using a days to express LDL receptor ( A ) or human Tfn receptor ( B ) .

As indicated by Western blot analy - surfacestainingwithantibodiesdirectedagainstLDLreceptororTfn sis of column fractions , (cid:109) 1B eluted in two peaks ( Figure receptor , respectively , was achieved as described in Experimental 3C ) . One peak coeluted with AP - 1 , as indicated by the Procedures . Specimens were analyzed by confocal microscopy , position of (cid:103) - adaptin at an apparent molecular weight and representative X - Y and X - Z sections are shown . The arrows in ( A ) mark the position of the filters . of 270 kDa . The second peak eluted with a molecular weight of (cid:122) 65 kDa and thus presumably represented unassembled and possibly monomeric (cid:109) 1B .

For this purpose , LLC - PK1 cells any other adaptor complex , each of which exhibited transfected with the (cid:109) 1A or (cid:109) 1B cDNAs were infected different apparent molecular weights as reported pre - with adLDLR and analyzed for cell surface appearance viously ( Dell’Angelica et al . , 1997 , 1999a ) . These data of the receptor . As shown in Figure 4A ( left panel ) , LLC - suggest that (cid:109) 1B can only assemble into AP - 1 com - PK1 cells transfected with (cid:109) 1A expressed the receptor plexes in the transfected LLC - PK1 cells , with overex - only at the apical plasma membrane , as found for paren - pressed (cid:109) 1B existing as unassembled monomer rather tal LLC - PK1 cells ( Figure 1B ) . LLC - PK1 cells transfected than entering AP - 2 , AP - 3 , or AP - 4 complexes . with (cid:109) 1B , however , exhibited a dramatic redistribution Thus , two alternative AP - 1 complexes can exist : one of LDL receptor to the basolateral plasma membrane containing the ubiquitously expressed (cid:109) 1A ( AP - 1A ) , and ( Figure 4B , right panel ) . Basolateral polarity was clearly the other the epithelial cell - specific (cid:109) 1B ( AP - 1B ) . Unfor - evident in virtually all infected cells in both X - Y confocal tunately , our (cid:109) 1B antibodies were not suitable for immu - images and X - Z vertical sections . These images were nofluorescence microscopy , as found for all other anti - (cid:109) indistinguishable from those obtained for infected MDCK chainantibodiesgeneratedtodate ( Simpsonetal . , 1996 ; cells that express (cid:109) 1B endogenously ( Figure 1A ) . Dell’Angelica et al . , 1999a , 1999b ) . It was , therefore , Another well - studied basolateral receptor is the hu - impossible to easily compare the intracellular distribu - man transferrin receptor ( Tfn receptor ) , which also relies tion of AP - 1A and AP - 1B . We were able to demonstrate , on a cytoplasmic tail signal for targeting to the basolat - however , that the two subunits were associated with eral plasma membrane domain ( Odorizzi and Trow - markedly different targeting functions . bridge , 1997 ) . We prepared a recombinant adenovirus encoding the wild - type receptor ( adTfnR ) , infected (cid:109) 1A - (cid:109) 1B Confers Basolateral Polarity of LDL and and (cid:109) 1B - expressing LLC - PK1 cells , and then assayed Transferrin Receptors in LLC - PK1 Cells for cell surface appearance of the receptor . As shown Having demonstrated that (cid:109) 1B expression in LLC - PK1 in Figure 4B ( left panel ) , (cid:109) 1A - expressing LLC - PK1 cells cells results in its incorporation in an AP - 1 adaptor com - plex , we next asked whether (cid:109) 1B expression would exhibited Tfn receptor at both the apical and basolateral Basolateral Targeting Adaptor Complex 193 encoding p75 NTR and assayed for surface expression of the receptor . As shown in Figure 5A , p75 NTR was found exclusively at the apical surface of both (cid:109) 1A - and (cid:109) 1B - expressing LLC - PK1 cells . We next examined the expression of a second protein that is strictly apical in MDCK cells . A recombinant ade - novirus was constructed encoding a chimeric mem - brane protein consisting of the extracellular region and membrane anchor of the murine Fc receptor ( FcRII ) fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the LDL receptor , truncated at position 22 ( FcL [ CT22 ] receptor ) . This trun - cation has previously been shown to delete all basolat - eral targeting information without affecting the recep - tor’s endocytosis signal ( dependent on the tyrosine at position 18 ) ( Matter et al . , 1994 ) . As found for p75 NTR , FcL ( CT22 ) receptor was expressed largely at the apical surface of LLC - PK1 cells regardless of whether they had been transfected with (cid:109) 1A or (cid:109) 1B ( Figure 5B ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that (cid:109) 1B expression in LLC - PK1 cells was only able to induce the basolateral targeting of proteins that contained ba - solateral targeting signals . Thus , a (cid:109) 1B - containing AP - 1 adaptor complex appears to be required and perhaps responsible for signal - mediated basolateral sorting . (cid:109) 1B Expression Enhances Overall Organization of Polarized LLC - PK1 Cells Not all membrane proteins depend on cytoplasmic do - main targeting signals for sorting to the basolateral sur - Figure 5 . Apical Sorting Is Not Affected in LLC - PK1 : : (cid:109) 1B Transfec - tants face of epithelial cells . Some proteins , such as E - cad - LLC - PK1 cellstransfected with (cid:109) 1A cDNA ( leftpanels ) or (cid:109) 1B cDNA herin or the Na , K - ATPase , achieve basolateral polarity ( right panels ) were grown on Transwell filters and infected with by homotypic interactions with proteins on adjacent recombinant adenoviruses for 1 hr and cultured for 2 days to allow cells or by interactions with the cytoskeleton at lateral for expression of p75 NTR ( A ) or FcL ( CT22 ) receptor ( B ) . Cell surfaces surfaces subsequent to cell – cell contact ( Mays et al . , were stained with antibodies directed against the p75 NTR or FcL 1995 ) . Although parental LLC - PK1 cells were unable to receptor , respectively , and analyzed by confocal microscopy as decode at least some cytoplasmic tail basolateral tar - described in Experimental Procedures . Shown are representative confocal images of X - Y and X - Z sections . geting signals , it was possible that they nevertheless formed a basolateral domain by other means . We there - fore next determined the polarity of endogenous Na , K - ATPase in cells expressing (cid:109) 1A or (cid:109) 1B . In both cases , plasma membrane domains . This was consistent with the “random” phenotype of a tail - minus Tfn receptor Na , K - ATPase distribution was largely restricted to the lateralplasmamembrane , correspondingtositesofcell – mutant expressed in MDCK cells ( Odorizzi and Trow - bridge , 1997 ) . In contrast , when adTfnR was used to cell contact ( Figure 6A ) . Thus , a protein whose polarity apparently depends on its ability to interact with cy - infect (cid:109) 1B - expressing LLC - PK1 cells , surface receptor was detected uniquely at the basolateral domain , a lo - toskeletal elements appeared to reach the basolateral domain even in the absence of (cid:109) 1B . calization that was evident in every infected cell and clearly seen in both X - Y and X - Z confocal sections ( Fig - Closer inspection of LLC - PK1 cell monolayers stained with Na , K - ATPase antibody suggested that (cid:109) 1B expres - ure 4B , right panel ) . Thus , (cid:109) 1B expression in LLC - PK1 cells confers the capacity for basolateral localization of sion had the effect of yielding cells with a more regularly organized monolayer . To examine this more directly , another membrane protein that is well known to be sorted to the basolateral surface in MDCK cells . (cid:109) 1A - and (cid:109) 1B - expressing LLC - PK1 cells were fixed and stained with FITC - coupled phalloidin , which outlines the overall shape of each cell by revealing the localization Polarity of Apical Proteins Is Not Affected by (cid:109) 1B Expression in LLC - PK1 Cells of filamentous actin . As shown in Figure 6B ( left panel ) , (cid:109) 1A - expressing cells ( and their nontransfected parents ) To determine whether (cid:109) 1B - induced basolateral sorting is selective for membrane proteins that bear basolateral often grew on polycarbonatefilters as irregularly shaped discontinuous cell sheets . Frequently , the cells piled up targeting signals , we next infected the (cid:109) 1A - and (cid:109) 1B - transfected LLC - PK1 cells with viruses encoding pro - on each other several deep in a disorganized fashion . (cid:109) 1B - expressing LLC - PK1 cells , on the other hand , grew teins that are apical in MDCK cells . We first examined the polarized expression of the p75 NTR isoform of nerve in a far more regular fashion ( Figure 6B , right panel ) . Although individual cells were not of uniform size ( as is growth factor receptor . p75 NTR contains an O - glycosy - lated stalk in its extracellular domain that is required for characteristic of MDCK cell cultures ) , they exhibited a strict monolayer arrangement and covered the filter sur - apical targeting ( Yeaman et al . , 1997 ) . Transfected LLC - PK1 cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus face in an essentially continuous fashion . Cell194 membrane . Nevertheless , it is highly likely that AP - 1B adaptors do act at the level of sorting as opposed , for example , toselectiveretentionofproteinsfollowingtheir appearance at the basolateral surface . First , the closely related AP - 1A , AP - 2 , and AP - 3 adaptor complexes are well known to mediate membrane protein sorting rather than retention ( Mellman , 1996 ; Marks et al . , 1997 ; Hirst and Robinson , 1998 ) . In addition , the signals apparently utilized by AP - 1B for basolateral targeting clearly act by facilitating polarized sorting , both in the TGN and in endosomes ( Matter et al . , 1993 ; Aroeti and Mostov , 1994 ) . Indeed , the fact that the same signals are de - coded at both sites suggests that the AP - 1B adaptor complex similarly works in both the secretory and endo - cytic pathways . In this regard , it may be of interest that (cid:103) - adaptin has been found on clathrin - coated buds on endosomes as well as the TGN but not at the plasma membrane ( Futter et al . , 1998 ) , although these earlier experiments could not distinguish AP - 1A and AP - 1B complexes . AP - 1B Complexes and the Decoding of Basolateral Targeting Signals It seems likely that (cid:109) 1B acts by directly recognizing basolateral targeting signals . Although this point re - Figure 6 .

Moreover , the fact the expression of (cid:109) 1B , an epithelial cell - specific compo - that (cid:109) 1B expression greatly improves the overall mono - nent of the AP - 1 clathrin adaptor complex .

In addition to tively accumulate proteins destined for the basolateral such itinerant cargo proteins , (cid:109) 1B may also be required surface . The selective accumulation of cargo into these forpackagingofspecificv - SNAREsrequiredforefficient vesicles is likely to reflect the interaction of the AP - 1B basolateral fusion . complex with at least a subset of distinct if degenerate In a yeast two - hybrid assay against peptides isolated targeting signals found in the cytoplasmic domains of from a combinatorial library , (cid:109) 1B has been found to many basolateral proteins . interact with a subset of tyrosine - containing motifs con - Due to the leakiness of the monolayers of parental as forming to the canonical sequence YXX φ ( Ohno et al . , well as transfected LLC - PK1 cells , it was impossible to 1999 ) . This finding is consistent with the conservation perform the type of vectorial biotinylation experiments of a YXX φ - binding site on (cid:109) 1B , as predicted from the needed to establish directly that expression of AP - 1B crystal structure of (cid:109) 2 ( Owen and Evans , 1998 ) .

This could explain why export of baso - lateral proteins , such as VSV G protein , from the TGN this seems not to be the case for the LDL or Tfn receptor basolateral signals . The LDL receptor tail contains two of fibroblasts may not involve clathrin ( Griffiths et al . , 1985 ) , although a role for clathrin in TGN to plasma tyrosine - based , non - YXX φ basolateral targeting deter - minants within its cytoplasmic tail ( Matter et al . , 1992 ) . membrane transport has not yet been definitively inves - tigated in any cell type .

At least in vitro , dileucine signals interact with (cid:98) rather than (cid:109) subunits ( Rapoport seems likely that transport vesicles formed with AP - 1B adaptors should contain clathrin , as is the case for “con - et al . , 1998 ) .

It is possible that other cell type – specific (cid:109) or other adaptor subunits exist that mediate polarized sion of their activities . For example , although the (cid:103) , (cid:98) , and (cid:115) subunits that coprecipitate with (cid:109) 1B are similar sorting in hepatocytes and neurons . Another possibility relates to the existence of different strategies for polar - to the corresponding subunits in (cid:109) 1A - containing com - plexes , they may also represent as yet unidentified , AP - ized targeting . In hepatocytes , for example , basolateral and apical proteins are not sorted in the TGN but rather 1B - specific isoforms . The existence of (cid:109) 1B in epithelial cells strongly sug - are delivered together to the sinusoidal ( basolateral ) plasma membrane and then sorted in endosomes fol - gests that there are , in fact , some significant differences between how polarized and “nonpolarized” cells sort lowing internalization ( Hubbard et al . , 1989 ; Wilton and Matthews , 1996 ) . Perhaps the ability to interact with membrane proteins in the TGN . In epithelial cells , recog - nition of basolateral targeting signals by AP - 1B appears AP - 1A , or an entirely novel sorting complex , at the level of endosomes precludes the need for AP - 1B , which may crucial for the formation of transport vesicles competent for fusion with the basolateral plasma membrane .
