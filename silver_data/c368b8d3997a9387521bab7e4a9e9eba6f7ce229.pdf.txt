Here we systematically quantified how excitation intensity influences localization precision and labeling density , the two main factors determining data quality . We found a strong trade - off between imaging speed and quality and present optimized imaging pro - tocols for high - throughput , multicolor and three - dimensional single - molecule localization microscopy with greatly improved resolution and effective labeling efficiency . Single - molecule localization microscopy ( SMLM ) techniques such as ( f ) PALM and ( d ) STORM provide unmatched spatial resolu - tion among fluorescence microscopy techniques 1 – 3 . As fluorophore blinking kinetics depend on the excitation intensity , the combina - tion of high excitation laser intensity and fast detection can speed up data acquisition by orders of magnitude 4 – 6 . Powerful lasers are therefore common practice ; although , until now , no clear consen - sus on the impact on SMLM image quality has been reached . The photon count per localization is the main determining factor of localization precision 7 . Investigating a variety of labels , different groups reported no substantial influence of the excitation intensity 8 , decreasing photon counts with increasing intensities 8 or highest photon counts with intermediate intensities that decrease with both increasing and decreasing intensities 6 , 9 . The second important fac - tor determining SMLM image quality is the labeling efficiency or density 10 , which has been estimated via photobleaching measure - ments 8 , 11 or localization density 6 , 10 , 12 . Here , we revisited the effects of excitation efficiency on image quality using a recently developed , highly quantitative assay based on nuclear pore complexes ( NPCs ) as reference standards 13 . We found that the two main factors determining SMLM image qual - ity , that is localization precision and labeling efficiency 12 , strongly deteriorate with high excitation intensity and , thus , imaging speed . We systematically investigated the effect of imaging speed on image quality for a variety of fluorophores , labeling approaches and imag - ing buffers . We varied the excitation intensity over three orders of magnitude , while adjusting the exposure time inversely to keep a constant light dose per frame , resulting in optimal average on times of the fluorophores of a few frames . We merged localizations persis - tent over consecutive frames to measure the total photon count per localization , which we find is largely independent of the exposure time ( Extended Data Fig . 1 ) . In addition , the precise stoichiome - try and eightfold symmetric arrangement of the reference protein Nup96 in the NPC allowed us to quantify absolute effective labeling efficiencies ( fraction of target proteins that are detected during the image acquisition ) , as well as the number of localizations per fluo - rophore 13 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . For the popular organic dye Alexa Fluor 647 ( AF647 , ref . 11 ) in a common oxygen depleting and thiol containing blinking buffer ( dSTORM approach 3 ) , fast imaging decreased the photon count per localization by a factor of ten ( Fig . 1a ) , resulting in a threefold deteri - orated localization precision and eightfold deteriorated Fourier ring correlation resolution 14 ( Fig . 1b ) . The effective labeling efficiency decreased by a factor of three ( Fig . 1c ) , leading to sparse images ( Fig . 1d ) , suggesting photobleaching during the initial off - switching phase , in which fluorophores are pushed into their dark state and cannot yet be localized due to high density of emitting fluorophores . Fluorophores that are irreversibly bleached during this phase are lost and reduce the effective labeling efficiency . In contrast , fluoro - phores bleached during the subsequent single - molecule imaging are likely to have emitted a sufficient number of photons to be localized and thus have little impact on the effective labeling efficiency . To test this hypothesis , we performed the initial off - switching at different intensities ( Fig . 1e and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , while keep - ing the conditions for subsequent single - molecule imaging identi - cal . The effective labeling efficiency increased by up to a factor of two for low - intensity off - switching . Consequently , NPCs appeared more densely labeled and , thus , seem more complete in the recon - structed image ( Fig . 1f ) . This observation has huge implications for the experimental design : In contrast to common practice 15 , the ini - tial off - switching should be performed with low intensities to retain a high effective labeling efficiency , otherwise up to half of the fluo - rophores are bleached before single - molecule detection even begins . Our findings can be qualitatively illustrated with simple mod - els describing fluorophore switching in dSTORM 16 , 17 in presence of bleaching ( Extended Data Fig . 2 and Supplementary Note 2 ) . The triplet state is long - lived in oxygen depleted buffers 18 , which leads to saturation of the fluorescence emission and thus decreased photon counts with high intensities . Photobleaching occurs predominantly from this triplet state 19 , leading to an intensity dependent bleaching that competes with transition into the dark state and recovery of the bright state . Thus , photobleaching becomes dominant for high intensities , reducing on times , photon counts and the number of localizations per fluorophore . Indeed , for low intensities , we could observe individual AF647 fluorophores five to ten times , while high intensities resulted in virtually no reactivations ( Fig . 1c ) . We tested the generality of our observations by investigating the effect of imaging speeds using different dSTORM imaging buffers ( glucose oxidase / catalase ( GLOX ) buffer with cysteamine ( MEA ) , b - mercaptoethanol ( BME ) or BME including refractive index matching ) , different tagging approaches ( SNAP - tag , nanobody , antibody , endogenous fusion of fluorescent proteins ) , as well as different fluorophores ( AF647 , CF680 , CF660C , Dy634 , mMaple ) Optimizing imaging speed and excitation intensity for single - molecule localization microscopy Robin Diekmann 1 , 3 , Maurice Kahnwald 1 , 2 , 3 , Andreas Schoenit 1 , Joran Deschamps 1 , Ulf Matti 1 and Jonas Ries 1 ✉ NAtURe MethODS | www . nature . com / naturemethods Brief CommuniCation NaturE MEtHoDS ( Extended Data Fig . 3 , Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figs . 2 – 10 ) . All conditions ( Fig . 1g ) qualitatively showed a similar trend of strongly decreased photon counts ( Fig . 1h ) and effective labeling efficiencies ( Fig . 1i ) for fast , high - intensity imaging . We found that CF660C was much less prone to bleaching ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) and resulted in higher numbers of reac - tivations than any other dye , making it a favorable dye for long high - intensity acquisitions . It enabled us to image whole cells via astigmatism - based three - dimensional dSTORM by stepping through multiple z positions in widefield illumination 20 ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2 ) . This is very challenging when using other dyes , as the acquisition of each image plane bleaches fluorophores in all planes ( Extended Data Fig . 4 ) and has before been tackled by sophisticated excitation / detection schemes of different light - sheet geometries 12 , 21 , 22 . With CF660C , on the other hand , we could image about 1 million frames , cover - ing a volume up to about 40 × 40 × 6 µ m 3 fitting an entire mitotic cell ( Extended Data Fig . 5 and Supplementary Video 3 ) . CF660C can well be combined with CF680 and AF647 for ratiometric three - color SMLM 23 , 24 at medium to high intensities ( Extended 500 ms 110 ms 1 . 6 kW / cm 2 28 ms 6 . 4 kW / cm2 7 . 5 ms 24 kW / cm 2 3 . 5 ms 53 kW / cm 2 1 . 5 ms 120 kW / cm 2 0 . 38 ms 480 kW / cm 2 50 s 0 . 36 kW / cm 2 3 s 6 . 4 kW / cm 2 0 . 5 s 53 kW / cm 2 0 . 04 s 480 kW / cm 2 a b c e d f h i BG - AF647 , BME BG - AF647 , BME , n = 1 . 4 BG - AF647 , MEA AB - AF647 , BME AB - CF660C , BME NB - CF680 , BME AB - Dy634 , BME mMaple , D 2 O g Nup96 - SNAP - AF647 , BME Nup96 - SNAP - AF647 , MEA Nup96 - mEGFP - AB - AF647 , BME Nup96 - SNAP - AF647 , BME , refractive index matched Nup96 - mEGFP - NB - CF680 , BME Nup96 - mEGFP - AB - CF660C , BME Nup96 - mEGFP - AB - Dy634 , BME Nup96 - mMaple Microtubule - AB - AF647 , BME 1 10 100 Intensity ( kW / cm 2 ) 0 5k 10k 15k 20k 25k P ho t on s pe r l o c a li z a t i on 1 10 100 Intensity ( kW / cm 2 ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 E ff e c t i v e l abe li ng e ff i c i en cy 1 10 100 1 10 100 1 10 100 1 10 100 0 5k 10k 15k 20k 25k 30k P ho t on s pe r l o c a li z a t i on 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Lo c a li z a t i on p r e c i s i on ( n m ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 F RC r e s o l u t i on ( n m ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 E ff e c t i v e l abe li ng e ff i c i en cy 0 5 10 15 20 Lo c a li z a t i on s pe r f l uo r opho r e 500 250 110 57 28 147 . 53 . 52 . 51 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 4 0 . 7 0 . 4 0 . 7 0 . 4 Frame exposure time ( ms ) 500 250 110 57 28 147 . 53 . 52 . 51 . 5 Frame exposure time ( ms ) 500 250 110 57 28 147 . 53 . 52 . 51 . 5 Frame exposure time ( ms ) 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 E ff e c t i v e l abe li ng e ff i c i en cy 50 12 3 0 . 9 0 . 5 0 . 3 0 . 04 Offswitching time ( s ) Intensity ( kW / cm 2 ) Intensity ( kW / cm 2 ) Intensity ( kW / cm 2 ) Offswitching intensity ( kW / cm 2 ) 0 . 36 kW / cm 2 Fig . 1 | effect of laser intensity and imaging speed on image quality . a – c , Mean number of photons per localization ( a ) , median localization precision and Fourier ring correlation ( FRC ) resolution ( b ) and effective labeling efficiency and mean number of localizations per fluorophore for AF647 in BME - based buffer as a function of the excitation intensity and single frame exposure time ( c ) . d , SMLM images of Nup96 - SNAP - AF647 corresponding to data shown in a – c . e , Effective labeling efficiency as a function of different off - switching intensities , recorded at identical imaging intensities of 61 kW cm − 2 . f , SMLM images of Nup96 - SNAP - AF647 corresponding to data shown in e . g , SMLM images of Nup96 using different buffers or labeling approaches recorded at 6 . 4 kW cm − 2 ( organic dyes ) or 1 . 9 kW cm − 2 ( mMaple ) . h , i , Mean number of photons per localization ( h ) , and effective labeling efficiency as a function of excitation intensity for different buffers or labeling approaches ( i ) .

For low intensities , how - ever , CF660C and CF680 exhibit a fraction of dim and long - lived states , rendering them unsuitable for SMLM ( Extended Data Fig . 3 and Supplementary Video 5 ) . On the other hand , both AF647 and Dy634 showed excellent performance at low - intensity conditions for highest - quality two - color SMLM ( Fig . 2b and Extended Data Fig . 7 ) . Lowest intensities result in very high photon counts and numer - ous localizations per fluorophore , allowing us to approach the resolution of DNA - PAINT by dSTORM , albeit without suffering from high background inherent to DNA - PAINT and without the need for TIRF / HILO illumination . This allowed us to visualize the four individual Nup96 proteins per symmetric unit of the NPC ( Fig . 2c , d and Supplementary Video 6 ) only 12 nm apart 13 , a resolu - tion that had been deemed out of reach for SMLM 25 . Compared to recent three - dimensional ( 3D ) DNA - PAINT measurements on the NPC 26 , we could more than double the effective labeling efficiencies to 65 % ( Fig . 1c ) with a comparable resolution .

NAtURe MethODS | www . nature . com / naturemethods Brief CommuniCation NaturE MEtHoDS Buffer acidification is known to limit long imaging times that are necessary when using low intensities by altering fluorophore properties . Tight chamber sealing can overcome this issue 27 . Simple parafilm sealing excluding any air bubbles enabled us to use the conventional GLOX buffer for more than 24 h without a substantial drop in pH or deteriorated data quality ( Extended Data Fig . 8 and Supplementary Video 7 ) . Slow imaging is not an option for live - cell SMLM , where the bio - logical process of interest dictates the imaging speed . As genetically encoded photoconvertible fluorescent proteins are labels of choice for live - cell imaging , we also tested the performance of mMaple for PALM at varying imaging speeds ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Unfortunately , we found the same trade - off between imaging speed and image quality for mMaple as for organic dyes , in line with pre - vious findings by Jones et al . for mEOS2 , who attributed the loss in labels to bleaching from the unconverted state 8 . Still , an excitation intensity of ~ 7 . 5 kW cm − 2 and a framerate of ~ 70 Hz represented a good compromise for mMaple , with high localization precision at only a moderate loss of effective labeling efficiency . This allowed us to resolve the circular structure of the NPC arrangement of Nup96 in living cells in only 20 s of acquisition time ( Fig . 2e and Supplementary Video 8 ) . We note that with these intensities photo - toxicity cannot be excluded 28 . In conclusion , we identified a clear trade - off between image quality and imaging speed in SMLM with slow imaging resulting in exceptional resolution and effective labeling efficiency . These findings were surprising in light of a recent report 6 , but a reanaly - sis of that data could resolve the contradiction and attribute it to suboptimal matching of exposure time and excitation inten - sity , which impeded correct merging of localizations ( Extended Data Fig . 9 ) . If high throughput is required , our findings provide a guideline on how to choose the best compromise between imaging speed and quality . Specifically , we could identify CF660C as a dye with increased photo stability , which retains high effective labeling effi - ciencies under fast imaging conditions and allowed us to assemble whole - cell super - resolution data with optimal labeling densities in all slices . Optimizing the composition of the imaging buffer spe - cifically at high excitation intensities has the potential to further improve image quality . We found that the common practice of performing the initial switching - off phase with high laser powers bleaches up to half of the fluorophores before they can be localized even once . Thus , to retain high labeling efficiencies , the initial switch - off should be performed with low laser powers . In light of the recent community effort to enhance SMLM via optically more and more complex detection schemes 29 , our results demonstrate a complementary and much simpler approach without optical modifications . Shifting to low laser powers will enable many laboratories to easily and directly improve their data quality .

Before seeding of cells , high - precision 24 - mm - round glass coverslips ( no . 1 . 5H , catalog no . 117640 , Marienfeld ) were cleaned by placing them overnight in a methanol : hydrochloric acid ( 50 : 50 ) mixture while stirring . After that , the coverslips were repeatedly rinsed with water until they reached a neutral pH . They were then placed overnight into a laminar flow cell culture hood to dry them before finally irradiating the coverslips by ultraviolet light for 30 min . Cells were seeded on clean glass coverslips 2 d before fixation to reach a confluency of about 50 – 70 % on the day of fixation . They were grown in growth medium ( DMEM ( catalog no . 11880 - 02 , Gibco ) ) containing 1 × MEM NEAA ( catalog no . 11140 - 035 , Gibco ) , 1 × GlutaMAX ( catalog no . 35050 - 038 , Gibco ) and 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( catalog no . 10270 - 106 , Gibco ) for approximately 2 d at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . Before further processing , the growth medium was aspirated and samples were rinsed twice with PBS to remove dead cells and debris . Unless otherwise stated , all experimental replicates were performed on cells of a different passage with separated sample preparation . Imaging buffers . The following buffers were used to image the indicated samples . GLOX + MEA . GLOX buffer supplemented with MEA was used to image Nup96 - SNAP - AF647 . GLOX + MEA contained 50 mM of Tris / HCl pH 8 , 10 mM of NaCl , 10 % ( w / v ) d - glucose , 500 µ g ml − 1 of glucose oxidase , 40 µ g ml − 1 of glucose catalase and 35 mM of MEA in H 2 O . GLOX + BME . GLOX buffer supplemented with BME was used to image Nup96 - SNAP - AF647 , Microtubule - AB - AF647 , Nup96 - mEGFP - NB - CF680 , Nup96 - mEGFP - AB - AF647 , Nup96 - mEGFP - AB - CF660C , Nup96 - mEGFP - AB - Dy634 , two - color samples ( Clathrin - AB - Dy634 and Microtubule - AB - AF647 ) and three - color samples ( Nup96 - SNAP - AF647 , ELYS - AB - CF660C , WGA - CF680 ) . GLOX + BME contained 50 mM of Tris / HCl pH 8 , 10 mM of NaCl , 10 % ( w / v ) d - glucose , 500 µ g ml − 1 of glucose oxidase , 40 µ g ml − 1 of glucose catalase and 143 mM of BME in H 2 O . GLOX + BME refractive index matched . GLOX buffer supplemented with BME and glycerol for refractive index matching ( n = 1 . 4 ) was used to image Nup96 - SNAP - AF647 and samples for whole - cell imaging ( Microtubule - AB - AF647 and Microtubule - AB - CF660C ) . GLOX + BME refractive index matched contained 40 mM of Tris / HCl pH 8 , 8 mM NaCl , 8 % ( w / v ) d - glucose , 55 % ( v / v ) glycerol 85 % , 500 µ g ml − 1 of glucose oxidase , 40 µ g ml − 1 of glucose catalase and 143 mM of BME in H 2 O . Here , 50 mM Tris in D 2 O was used to image Nup96 - mMaple in fixed cells and 50 mM Tris in D 2 O contained 50 mM of Tris / HCl pH 8 in 95 % ( v / v ) D 2 O . Growth medium with HEPES was used to image Nup96 - mMaple in live cells . Growth medium with HEPES contained 1 × MEM NEAA ( catalog no . 11140 - 035 , Gibco ) , 1 × GlutaMax ( catalog no . 35050 - 038 , Gibco ) , 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( catalog no . 10270 - 106 , Gibco ) and 20 mM of HEPES ( pH 7 . 25 ) in DMEM . Sample staining . Preparation of Nup96 - mMaple samples ( live and fixed cells ) . For imaging of live cells , coverslips containing Nup96 - mMaple cells ( catalog no . 300461 , CLS Cell Line Service ) were rinsed twice with warm PBS before they were mounted onto a custom - manufactured sample holder in 1 ml of growth medium containing 20 mM of HEPES buffer and imaged directly . For data acquisition on fixed Nup96 - mMaple cells , the coverslips were rinsed twice with warm PBS . Prefixation was carried out in a 2 . 4 % ( w / v ) formaldehyde ( FA ) in PBS solution for 40 s before the samples were permeabilized in 0 . 4 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 in PBS for 3 min . Complete fixation was carried out in 2 . 4 % ( w / v ) FA in PBS for 30 min followed by 3 × 5 min washing steps in PBS after fixation . To quench FA , the samples were placed in 100 mM of NH 4 Cl in PBS for 5 min and afterward washed three times in PBS for 5 min each . Samples were then mounted into custom - manufactured sample holders in appropriate imaging buffer ( see section Imaging buffers ) . The holder was sealed with parafilm . Preparation of Nup96 - SNAP samples . Nup96 - SNAP - tag cells ( catalog no . 300444 , CLS Cell Line Service ) were fixed analogous to the procedure described for preparation of fixed Nup96 - mMaple samples . Subsequently , the sample was incubated for 30 min with Image - iT FX Signal Enhancer ( catalog no . I36933 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) before staining with SNAP dye buffer ( 3 µ M BG - AF647 ( catalog no . S9136S , New England Biolabs ) and 3 µ M dithiothreitol in 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in PBS ) for 2 h at room temperature .

Shortly before imaging , the sample was incubated for 10 min with 1 : 5 , 000 diluted WGA - CF680 ( catalog no . 29029 - 1 , Biotium ) in PBS , rinsed three times with PBS and mounted onto a custom - manufactured sample holder in appropriate imaging buffer ( see Imaging buffers ) . The holder was sealed with parafilm . Microscope setup . The custom - build widefield microscope used for acquiring all single - color data is described in Supplementary Note 1 and shown in Supplementary Fig . 12 . SMLM data acquisition for intensity titration . For intensity dependent measurements , we recorded a region of 128 by 128 pixels in the center of the camera chip . We used the global exposure trigger to illuminate the sample only during the time in which all lines of the rolling shutter sCMOS camera where exposed simultaneously . This effective laser exposure time was 1 . 55 ms shorter than the camera exposure time set in Micro - Manager . We chose the excitation intensities such that the product of the effective laser exposure time and the intensity stayed constant for all conditions of individual fluorophores ( Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Dataset 1 ) . For the fastest acquisition settings , we kept the camera exposure time setting on 3 ms each but triggered the acousto - optic tunable filter only for 0 . 725 or 0 . 375 ms , respectively . The 405 - nm ultraviolet ( UV ) laser for active photoswitching was run at constant power resulting in an intensity of 0 . 015 kW cm − 2 , but at variable pulse - widths . For SNAP - and mMaple - labeled cells , imaging was stopped when almost all emitters in the region of interest ( ROI ) were bleached . For antibody - and nanobody - labeled cells , imaging was stopped after 31 , 000 frames . For Dy634 , we observed dense labeling . Therefore , we prebleached the samples for 45 s ( 1 , 500 frames at 30 ms camera exposure time ) for every titration step using 28 . 5 kW cm − 2 excitation laser and UV activation intensity of 0 . 04 kW cm − 2 . The first 1 , 000 frames were discarded for all conditions . SMLM data acquisition for off - switching intensity titration . Different off - switching conditions were realized by recording , but not analyzing , 100 frames each at the respective pair of off - switching intensity and camera exposure time ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Hence , the effective laser off - switching times were slightly lower , but the duration of the off - switching phase was limited by the camera exposure time . We then changed both the intensity , camera exposure time and effective laser exposure time to either 24 kW cm − 2 , 9 and 7 . 45 ms or 61 kW cm − 2 , 3 and 1 . 25 ms , respectively . Note that the latter condition ( shown in Fig . 1e , f ) does not fit our otherwise applied standard of keeping the product of effective laser exposure time and intensity constant , but was instead chosen to effectively fit the image acquisition conditions of a recent study by Barentine et al . 5 . Other than this , the same procedure was applied as described above . SMLM data acquisition for other experiments . Whole - cell 3D images were recorded at a set camera exposure time of 12 ms , corresponding to an effective single frame laser exposure time of about 7 . 6 ms . A mean excitation laser intensity of 24 . 3 kW cm − 2 and UV activation intensity of 0 . 011 kW cm − 2 were used . Long - term imaging for comparison of AF647 and CF660C was recorded with the same conditions as for whole - cell 3D imaging , but on a smaller ROI ( 128 × 128 pixels ) . Images were acquired until all fluorophores were bleached . Nup96 3D images were recorded at a set camera exposure time of 500 ms , corresponding to an effective single frame laser exposure time of 498 ms , a mean excitation laser intensity of 0 . 36 kW cm − 2 and a UV activation intensity of 0 . 015 kW cm − 2 . Live - cell mMaple images were recorded at a set camera exposure time of 14 ms , corresponding to an effective single frame exposure time of 12 . 45 ms , a mean excitation laser intensity 7 . 5 kW cm − 2 and a UV activation intensity of 0 . 015 kW cm − 2 . Two - color ratiometric images of AF647 and Dy634 were recorded at a set and effective single frame exposure time of 116 ms using an EM - CCD camera in frame transfer mode , a mean excitation laser intensity of 1 . 6 kW cm − 2 and a UV activation intensity of 0 . 08 kW cm − 2 . Three - color ratiometric images of AF647 , CF660C and CF680 were recorded at a set and effective single frame exposure times of 20 – 30 ms using an EM - CCD camera in frame transfer mode , mean laser intensity of 7 kW cm − 2 and a UV activation intensity of 0 . 08 kW cm − 2 . Long - term buffer pH stability . The chamber in the sample holder was filled with 1 ml of freshly mixed GLOX + BME buffer and sealed with parafilm excluding all air bubbles , identical to chamber preparations for the imaging experiments . We measured the pH value directly before sealing the chamber , and directly after opening the chamber 24 h later . For comparison , 1 ml of freshly mixed GLOX + BME buffer was stored in unclosed tubes with a buffer – air interface area of 0 . 8 cm 2 for 24 h . Storage was performed at room temperature identical to all image acquisitions . Indicator paper was used to determine the pH value ( MColorpHast for pH 6 . 5 – 10 . 0 , Merck , or pH 0 – 14 Universal indicator , Merck ) . SMLM data analysis . SMLM data analysis was conducted as described in Supplementary Note 3 using previously published algorithms 13 with custom software written in MATLAB ( super - resolution microscopy analysis platform , SMAP 30 ) , available as open source at github . com / jries / SMAP . 3D bead calibration . Tetra - Speck beads ( 0 . 75 µ l from stock , catalog no . T7279 , Thermo Fisher ) were diluted in 360 µ l H 2 O , mixed with 40 µ l 1 M MgCl 2 and put on a coverslip in a custom - manufactured sample holder . After 10 min , the mix was replaced with 400 µ l H 2 O . For experiments where the Si - oil objective was used , the mix was replaced by 400 µ l refractive index matched buffer consisting of 55 % glycerol ( 85 % ) and 45 % H 2 O . Using Micro - Manager , about 20 positions on the coverslip were defined and the beads were imaged acquiring z stacks ( − 1 to 1 µ m , 10 - nm step size ) using the same filters as used in the intended experiment . In SMAP , an average point - spread function ( PSF ) model was calculated from tens of beads 30 . Fitting and postprocessing . Two - dimensional data were fitted with a symmetric Gaussian PSF model with the PSF size , x , y , photons per localization and the background as free - fitting parameters using maximum likelihood estimation 30 . 3D data were fitted using an experimentally derived PSF model from the 3D bead calibration with x , y , z , photons per localization and the background as free - fitting parameters using maximum likelihood estimation 30 . Fitted data were first grouped by merging localizations persistent over consecutive frames within 35 nm from each other ( with an allowed gap of one dark frame ) into one localization with its position calculated by the weighted average of individual x , y and z positions . Photons per localization as well as the background were summed over all frames in which the grouped localization was detected . Data was then drift corrected in x , y and z by a custom algorithm based on redundant cross - correlation . From the spread of the redundant displacements we estimated the accuracy of the drift correction to be better than 1 . 5 nm in x and y and 2 nm in z . Before analysis , the localizations were filtered based on localization precision ( 0 – 10 nm for dSTORM data of organic dyes shown in Fig . 1 , 0 – 15 nm for PALM data of mMaple shown in Fig . 1 ) to exclude extraordinarily dim localizations , PSF size ( laterally 0 – 160 nm for dSTORM data of organic dyes or laterally 0 – 160 nm for PALM data of mMaple , for two - dimensional data only ) to remove out of focus localizations , frames ( from 1 , 000 until completion , except for antibody - and nanobody - staining data used for power titration measurements where the acquisition was stopped after 31 , 000 frames ; no frame filter was applied to mMaple data shown in Fig . 1 ) . Additionally , localizations with a bad fit were filtered based on log - likelihood . We note that different filters affect the absolute number of photons , but the loss of photons with increasing excitation intensity stays qualitatively the same ( Extended Data Fig . 10 ) . 3D data of Nup96 were filtered based on localization precision ( 0 – 5 nm laterally , 45 nm axially ) , log - likelihood to exclude bad fits and z position to reject molecules far away from the focal plane . 3D two - color data were filtered based on localization precision ( 0 – 10 nm for Dy634 and 0 – 4 nm for AF647 ) , frames ( 1 , 000 to completion ) , log - likelihood to exclude bad fits and z position to reject molecules far away from the focal plane . 3D three - color data were filtered based on localization precision ( 0 – 10 nm laterally for all dyes ) , log - likelihood to exclude bad fits and z position to reject molecules far away from the focal plane . Whole - cell 3D data were filtered based on lateral localization precision ( 0 – 10 nm ) , axial localization precision ( 0 – 40 nm ) and log - likelihood . Slices of different z positions were first drift corrected individually and then registered in 3D based on cross - correlation . Super - resolved images were finally reconstructed , where every localization was rendered as an elliptical Gaussian . Reported photons per localization are calculated on merged and filtered localizations . We did not use a sCMOS - specific fitter 4 , but confirmed that ignoring the sCMOS - specific properties of pixel - dependent noise , gain and offset had negligible influence on the photon statistics . All given photon counts are based on the manufacturer’s camera calibration . To separate the colors in ratiometric imaging , the localizations were filtered and the ratio between photons from both channels were plotted . The channels for each fluorophore were assigned manually by drawing ROIs in the plot . This assignment was saved and used later for crosstalk determination . Determination of crosstalk in ratiometric imaging . To determine the crosstalk between AF647 and Dy634 , cells expressing Nup96 - SNAP were labeled with BG - AF647 and cells expressing Nup96 - mEGFP were immunostained with an antibody coupled to Dy634 , as described previously . The samples were imaged , reconstructed and filtered individually using the same conditions as used for the two - color acquisition . The same filters for ratiometric color separation were used NAtURe MethODS | www . nature . com / naturemethods Brief CommuniCation NaturE MEtHoDS and the localizations identified as AF647 , Dy634 and not assigned ( that is , rejected ) were counted . For three - color imaging , the crosstalk was identically determined , but based on the individually stained structures as described above : Nup96 - SNAP via BG - AF647 staining , ELYS via indirect immunostaining with CF660C and WGA - CF680 ) . Segmentation of nuclear pores . All images used in this work that are based on Nup96 - derived data , were segmented automatically in SMAP . For this , reconstructed images were convolved with a kernel consisting of a ring with a radius corresponding to the radius of the NPC , convolved with a Gaussian . Local maxima over a user - defined threshold were treated as possible candidates . Candidates were cleaned up by two additional steps . ( 1 ) We fitted the localizations corresponding to each candidate with a circle and excluded structures with a very small ( < 50 nm for antibody - labeled data , < 40 nm for other ) or very large ( > 80 nm for antibody - labeled data , > 70 nm for other ) ring radius . ( 2 ) Localizations were refitted with a circle of fixed radius to determine the center coordinates . Structures were rejected if more than 25 % of localizations were closer than 40 nm to the center ( 50 nm for antibody - labeled data ) or if more than 40 % of localizations were further away than 70 nm ( 80 nm for antibody - labeled data ) from the center , as these typically did not visually resemble NPCs or were two adjacent wrongly segmented NPCs . Determination of effective labeling efficiencies . Calculation of effective labeling efficiencies was done on all successfully segmented NPCs and followed an automated six - step protocol . ( 1 ) Localizations were fitted with a ring with a fixed radius corresponding to the mean radius determined before . Additionally , localization coordinates were converted into polar coordinates ϕ I , r I . ( 2 ) Localizations closer to the center than 30 nm ( 50 nm for antibody - labeled data ) or further away than 70 nm ( 80 nm for antibody - labeled data ) were excluded as background localizations . ( 3 ) Rotational alignment of structures was achieved by minimizing ϕ rot ¼ argmin ϕ rot ϕ rot � ϕ I mod π 4 (cid:31) (cid:30) : I ( 4 ) The structures were overlayed with a mask consisting of eightfold symmetric segments , recapitulating the arrangement of Nup96 in the NPC . We counted the number of segments containing a localization from a histogram of ϕ I with a bin width of π 4 and a start bin of ϕ rot (cid:31) π 8 I . ( 5 ) We then constructed a histogram of the number of detected nonempty segments in all NPCs in the dataset and fitted it using a probabilistic model as described before 13 with the effective labeling efficiency as a free - fitting parameter . ( 6 ) Statistical error was determined by bootstrapping with 20 resampled data sets . Determination of the number of localizations per fluorophore . The number of localizations per fluorophore was calculated by dividing the number of localizations per NPC by the effective labeling efficiency times 32 ; that is , the number of Nup96 molecules per NPC .

Realistic simulations of camera frames ( see Supplementary Note 2 ) for a constant excitation intensity when varying the exposure time over four orders of magnitude . Our standard analysis workflow was used to merge localizations in consecutive frames , stemming from the same fluorophore , and to determine the photons per localization , localization precision , on - time and background per localization per pixel . These simulations show an optimal exposure time that is shorter than the mean on - time , which leads to the highest localization precision . Around this value , the photons per localization and the localization precision display only minimal dependence on the exposure time . For much shorter exposure times , however , merging fails due to missed localizations and large localization errors , reducing photons per localization and deteriorating the localization precision . For exposure times longer than the mean on - time , the background increases linearly with the exposure time , whereas the photons per localization stay constant , also leading to a deteriorated localization precision .

Lin et al . reported a nonmonotonic dependence of the photons per localization as a function of the excitation intensity ( blue curve , original data read from the publication ) for dSTORM imaging of immunostained microtubules . To investigate the discrepancy with our data ( gray curve ) , that is monotonically decreasing photons per localization as a function of the excitation intensity , we partially ( n c = 1 for each intensity , N = 1 ) refitted and reanalyzed the original data kindly provided by Yu Lin and Joerg Bewersdorf . Using our fitter , our localization filter settings and our analysis pipeline , we find higher photons per localization but the same general trend ( magenta curve ) . However , Lin et al . did not keep the product of excitation intensity and single frame exposure time constant . For our data it is constant with t ex I = 0 . 18kW / c m 2 s . Instead , Lin et al . used exposure times as short as 20 ms even for the lowest intensities for example resulting in t ex I = 0 . 02kW / c m 2 s . As a consequence , blink events easily persist over tens of frames , which makes grouping of localizations error prone . To virtually adjust the product of excitation intensity and single frame exposure time for the data of Lin et al . , we summed up single frames of the raw data before fitting ( 9 frames each for 1 kW / cm 2 , 5 frames each for 1 . 9 kW / cm 2 , 2 frames each for 3 . 9 kW / cm 2 ) or selected the conditions closest to our value chosen for the product ( 7 . 8 kW / cm 2 to 97 kW / cm 2 ) . Additionally , Lin et al . used a less effective setup of emission filters which we estimate to transmit 79 % less fluorescence than our excitation filters . Combining both the refit data of the virtually restored product of excitation intensity and exposure time as well as scaling up the photons by 79 % ( green curve ) is well in agreement with our results . For each intensity in our data , the mean value ± standard deviation is shown over the data points representing individual cells .

The localization filters applied for organic dyes in this study influence the localization statistics . To visualize the influence , we applied different filter settings to the localizations and re - analyzed the data with respect to the photon counts . Though the absolute numbers change , the general trend of decreasing photon counts with increasing excitation intensity is maintained . These graphs are for the sample Nup96 - SNAP - AF647 in 143 mM BME ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . See Supplementary Table 1 for sample size and replicates .
