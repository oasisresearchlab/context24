Structural studies show that the N - terminal talin head contains an atypical FERM domain , whereas the N - and C - terminal parts of the talin rod include a series of (cid:1) - helical bundles . However , determining the structure of the central part of the rod has proved problematic . Residues 1359 – 1659 are homologous to the MESDc1 gene product , and we therefore expressed this region of talin in Escherichia coli . The crystal structure shows a unique fold comprised of a 5 - and 4 - helix bundle . The 5 - helix bundle is composed of nonsequential helices due to insertion of the 4 - helix bundle into the loop at the C terminus of helix (cid:1) 3 . The linker connecting the bundles forms a two - stranded anti - parallel (cid:2) - sheet likely limiting the relative movement of the two bundles . Because the 5 - helix bundle contains the N and C termini of this module , we propose that it is linked by short loops to adja - cent bundles , whereas the 4 - helix bundle protrudes from the rod . Thissuggeststhe4 - helixbundlehasauniquerole , anditspI ( 7 . 8 ) is higher than other rod domains . Both helical bundles contain vin - culin - bindingsitesbutthatintheisolated5 - helixbundleiscryptic , whereas that in the isolated 4 - helix bundle is constitutively active . Incontrast , bothbundlesarerequiredforactinbinding . Finally , we showthattheMESDc1protein , whichispredictedtohaveasimilar fold , is a novel actin - binding protein . Talin is a large ( 2541 amino acids ) dimeric cytoskeletal pro - tein that provides a direct link between the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules and the actin cytoskeleton ( 1 – 3 ) , and it has a pivotal role in integrin activation ( 4 , 5 ) and clustering ( 6 ) . Talin depletion blocks cell spreading and the assembly of cell - matrix junctions ( focal adhesions ; FA ) 2 in vitro ( 7 – 9 ) , whereas knock - out of the gene encoding the talin1 isoform is embryonic lethal in mice at gastrulation ( 10 ) . Use of a conditional talin1 allele confirms that talin1 is essential to integrin activation in platelets ( 11 , 12 ) and the stability of the membrane cytoskeletal interface in megakaryocytes ( 13 ) , and deletion of both the talin1 and talin2 isoforms in skeletal muscle leads to disruption of the myotendinous junction and inhibition of myoblast fusion ( 14 , 15 ) . The N - terminal talin head ( 47 kDa ) ( Fig . 1 ) contains a FERM domain composed of F1 , F2 , and F3 domains , although it is atypical in that F1 contains a large unstructured insert and is preceded by a previously unrecognized domain , F0 ( 16 , 17 ) . The F3 domain has a phosphotyrosine - binding domain - like fold and binds to both the membrane proximal NP X Y motif in (cid:1) 3 - integrin tails and the membrane proximal helix ( 18 – 20 ) . This is thought to disrupt the inter - subunit interactions be - tween the (cid:2) - and (cid:1) - integrin cytoplasmic tails and also their trans - membrane helices ( 21 ) leading to integrin activation , although it is now clear that integrin activation also requires cooperation between talin and the kindlin family of FERM domain proteins ( 22 ) . The talin rod ( 220 kDa ) is composed of 62 (cid:2) - helices orga - nized into a series of amphipathic helical bundles ( Fig . 1 ) . It contains a second integrin - binding site ( IBS2 ) ( 23 , 24 ) , at least two actin - binding sites ( 25 ) , the best characterized of which is at the C terminus ( 26 , 27 ) , and numerous vinculin - binding sites ( VBSs ) ( 28 ) . Using limited proteolysis and a large series of recombinant polypeptides , we have begun to identify some of the domains that make up the talin rod and to determine their structures ( 19 , 20 , 23 , 27 , 29 – 33 ) and their mode of interaction with integrins , vinculin , and F - actin ( 2 ) . The rod starts with a 5 - helix bundle ( residues 482 – 655 ) that packs against a 4 - helix bundle ( residues 656 – 786 ) via an extensive hydrophobic inter - face ( 32 ) . The C - terminal region of the rod ( residues 1655 – 2482 ) is composed of five 5 - helix bundles coupled by short flex - ible linkers and ends with a single helix that is responsible for talin dimer formation ( 27 ) . An intramolecular interaction be - tween the F3 FERM domain and one of the C - terminal rod domains ( residues 1655 – 1822 ) masks the integrin - binding site in F3 ( 31 , 34 ) and is thought to contribute to the regulation of talin activity and to the compact form of the molecule seen in electron microscopy ( 35 , 36 ) . However , the domain organization of the central region of the rod has been difficult to resolve . Interestingly , residues 1359 – 1659 show significant homology to the gene referred to as mesoderm development candidate 1 ( Mesdc1 ) ( 37 ) , which is * Thisworkwassupported , inwholeorinpart , byNationalInstitutesofHealth GrantU54GM64346fromNIGMSCellMigrationConsortium .

We therefore expressed this region of talin in Esche - richia coli and found that the protein was soluble , stable , and easy to crystallize . We now report the structure of this region of talin and show that it is made up of a 5 - and a 4 - helix bundle with unique topology . It contains an actin - binding site , two VBSs , and a binding site for the intermediate filament protein (cid:2) - synemin , which colocalizes with talin in the costameres of skeletal muscle ( 38 ) . Moreover , we demonstrate that the MESDc1 protein is a novel actin - binding protein . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression and Purification —The regions encoding murine talin residues 1359 – 1659 , 1359 – 1659 (cid:1) 1454 – 1586 , 1458 – 1584 , and 1461 – 1580 were synthesized by PCR using mouse Talin1 cDNA as template and cloned into the expres - sion vector pET - 151 / D - TOPO ( Invitrogen ) . Because MESDc1 is encoded by one exon , full - length murine MESDc1 ( residues 1 – 362 ) was amplified from genomic DNA using PCR and cloned into the expression vector pET - 151 / D - TOPO . Con - structs were expressed in E . coli BL21 Star ( DE3 ) , cultured either in LB or , for preparation of 15 N - labeled samples for NMR , in minimal media containing 1 g of [ 15 N ] ammonium chloride / liter . For selenomethionine incorporation , recombi - nant His - tagged talin ( 1359 – 1659 ) was expressed in E . coli B834 and cultured in appropriate minimal media . Recombinant His - tagged talin polypeptides were purified by nickel - affinity chro - matography following standard procedures . The His tag was removed by cleavage with an enhanced form of tobacco etch virus ( TEV ) protease ( Invitrogen ) , and the protein was further purified by anion - exchange chromatography . Recombinant His - tagged chicken vinculin domain 1 ( Vd1 ; residues 1 – 258 ) was expressed using a pET - 15b expression plasmid and purified as described previously ( 32 ) . The concen - tration of the purified proteins was determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm . X - ray Crystallography —Crystals of talin residues 1359 – 1659 were obtained at 6 °C by vapor diffusion equilibration against 18 % ( w / v ) PEG 8000 , 100 m M Tris , 180 m M sodium phosphate dibasic at pH 8 . 5 . Protein at 15 mg / ml in 0 . 2 M NaCl , 2 m M DTT , and 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , was mixed with an equal volume of precipitant . The crystals adopted the space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 with 1 molecule per asymmetric unit ( see Table 1 ) and a solvent content of 66 . 8 % . Diffraction data were collected from native crystals at ESRF beamline ID14 - 2 and from selenomethionine crystals at beam - line ID23 - 1 , recorded on ADSC Q315R CCD detectors . Data were processed with XDS ( 39 ) . Phases were determined from the anomalous data collected at the selenium absorption peak ( (cid:3) (cid:2) 0 . 97905 ) from selenomethionine crystals . 7 of the 10 pos - sible selenium atoms were located using SHELX ( 40 ) , and a map was constructed using these preliminary phases at 2 . 15 Å reso - lution . An initial atomic model was built using the ARP / wARP helical recognition approach ( 41 ) , and the model was rebuilt manually with Coot ( 42 ) and refined using maximum likelihood refinement in Refmac5 ( 43 ) . Subsequently , the structure was refined against a new 2 . 0 Å data set collected from native crystals . The final model converged to an R work of 21 . 4 % for all data between 50 . 0 and 2 . 0 Å and an R free of 26 . 4 % . The final Ram - achandran plot shows 93 . 5 % of residues in favored regions , 4 . 2 % in additional favored regions , and 2 . 3 % in generously allowed regions , as defined by PROCHECK ( 44 ) . The structure has been submitted to the Protein Data Bank with the accession number 2x0c . Figures were generated with CCP4mg ( 45 ) . Vinculin Binding —Analytical gel filtration chromatography was used to determine the ability of recombinant talin polypep - tides ( 50 (cid:4) M ) to bind to the vinculin Vd1 domain ( 50 (cid:4) M ) using a Superdex - 75 ( 10 / 300 ) GL column ( Amersham Biosciences ) . Polypeptides were incubated at various temperatures for 30 min prior to loading onto the column , which was pre - equili - brated and eluted with 20 m M Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 150 m M NaCl , and 2 m M DTT at a flow rate of 0 . 8 ml / min at room temperature . The fractions were analyzed using SDS - PAGE . Actin Cosedimentation Assays —G - actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle ( 46 ) and polymerized in 10 m M Tris , 50 m M NaCl , 100 (cid:4) M ATP , 1 m M DTT , 1 m M MgCl 2 , pH 7 . 0 . Assays were performed using 4 (cid:4) M talin and 10 (cid:4) M F - actin . The mix - ture was incubated for 60 min at room temperature and centri - fuged at 100 , 000 rpm for 30 min at 22 °C using a Beckman Optima TM ultracentrifuge . Supernatants and pellets were ana - lyzed on SDS - polyacrylamide gels and stained using Coomassie Blue . FIGURE 1 . Domain structure and binding partners of talin .

Far - UV CD spectra were recorded at 20 °C over the wavelength range 200 – 250 nm in a quartz cell of 0 . 1 cm path length ( scan rate 50 nm (cid:2) min (cid:4) 1 ) . Proteins were dis - solved in 20 m M sodium phosphate , pH 6 . 5 , 50 m M NaCl at a concentration of 10 (cid:4) M . For denaturation studies , the unfolding of (cid:2) - helices was followed at 222 nm . Cell Culture and Transfection —NIH3T3 cells were cultured on uncoated plastic dishes in DMEM with 5 % FCS and penicil - lin / streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 . Subconfluent cells ( 6 (cid:5) 10 6 cells / ml ) were trypsinized and washed in PBS , and 1 (cid:5) 10 5 cells were electroporated ( using a NEON Microporator from Invitrogen ; 1300 mV / 20 ms / 2 pulses ) with 10 (cid:4) g of DNA per transfection and plated on uncoated glass coverslips ( Ray - mond A . Lamb , East Sussex , UK ) . 48 h after transfection , cells were washed once with PBS , permeabilized for 4 min with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in 20 m M Tris , pH 7 . 6 , 4 m M MgCl 2 , 300 m M sucrose , 1 m M PMSF , and fixed for 10 min using 3 . 7 % paraform - aldehyde in PBS ( 47 ) . F - actin was stained with phalloidin - TRITC ( Molecular Probes ) for 20 min , and the coverslips were sealed on glass slides with Mowiol solution ( Sigma ) . Epifluores - cence images were taken on an inverted Nikon TE300 micro - scope equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA - ER digital camera and an X - cite 120 fluorescence illumination system controlled by Openlab software ( Improvision ) . Images were analyzed using Irfanview and Adobe Photoshop . RESULTS Talin Residues 1359 – 1659 Are Homologous to MESDc1 —To identify talin rod domains for structural studies , we initially aligned the talin sequence with other proteins in the database , an approach previously used to identify the C - terminal actin - binding domain in talin that is homologous to that of the HIP1R family of proteins ( 48 ) . The alignment showed ( supplemental Fig . S1 A ) that the central region of the talin rod ( residues 1359 – 1659 ) was homologous to a protein of unknown function en - coded by a gene called mesoderm development candidate 1 ( Mesdc1 ) ( 37 ) . This region of talin is conserved across species ( supplemental Fig . S2 A ) , and secondary structure predictions on both talin ( 1359 – 1659 ) and MESDc1 identified nine (cid:2) - heli - ces with almost identical boundaries suggesting that both pro - teins have a similar tertiary structure . Crystal Structure of Talin Residues 1359 – 1659 Reveals a Novel Protein Fold —We expressed recombinant talin ( 1359 – 1659 ) in E . coli , and the purified polypeptide was soluble and stable . Removal of helices from either the N or C terminus resulted in an insoluble polypeptide , suggesting that the nine helices form a discrete domain . The purified polypeptide yielded crystals that diffracted x - rays , and we determined initial phases using anomalous scattering from a selenomethionine derivative ( see “Experimental Procedures” ) at 2 . 15 Å resolution , and subsequently we collected a native diffraction set at 2 . 0 Å resolution for refinement ( Table 1 ) . The final high resolution model includes one copy of talin residues 1359 – 1659 within the asymmetric unit . As predicted , this region of talin contains nine (cid:2) - helices forming a 5 - and a 4 - helix bundle with an unusual domain linkage ( Fig . 2 A ) . Both the bundles are made up of amphipathic helices and have a hydrophobic core . A search for similar structures using the DALI server finds 5 - and 4 - helix bundles , but no other protein in the database has a similar fold to that observed for talin ( 1359 – 1659 ) . This novel fold shows a 4 - helix bundle inserted into one of the loops in the 5 - helix bundle ( between helices (cid:2) 3 and (cid:2) 4 ) . This makes the 5 - helix bundle unique in that it is composed of nonsequential helices , i . e . helix (cid:2) 1 , (cid:2) 2 , (cid:2) 3 , (cid:2) 8 , and (cid:2) 9 ( equivalent to helices 28 , 29 , 30 , 35 , and 36 of the talin rod ) . Such an insertion has not previously been identified as judged by DomIns . There is no interaction between the two bundles in the crys - tal structure , and none of the contacts in the crystal lattice seem biologically relevant . The topology of the helices and nature of the arrangement are very different from that of the 5 - and 4 - he - lix bundles at the N terminus of the talin rod ( residues 482 – 789 ) ( 32 ) . In the latter case , the two bundles have a staggered arrangement , with the 4 - helix bundle packing against the 5 - he - lix bundle , stabilized by extensive hydrophobic contacts . In the new structure , no hydrophobic patches are present on the sur - face of either bundle ( Fig . 2 B ) . The structure is also different from the IBS2 region ( residues 1973 – 2293 ) where two 5 - helix bundles ( IBS2 - A and IBS2 - B ) stack end to end in the crystal structure ( 23 ) . The 5 - helix bundle in the new structure has the same topol - ogy as observed previously in the talin rod , comprising five anti - parallel (cid:2) - helices ( ranging from 25 to 33 residues in length ) arranged with right - handed crossover connectivity . A long 10 - residue linker connects the first and second helices ( (cid:2) 1 - (cid:2) 2 ) ; otherwise , the helices are connected by short loops ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . This bundle topology has only previously been seen TABLE 1 Summary of crystallographic analysis and refinement statistics for talin residues 1359 – 1659 R sym (cid:2) (cid:6) (cid:1) I (cid:4) (cid:7) I (cid:8) (cid:1) (cid:6) I , where I is the observed intensity and (cid:7) I (cid:8) is the average intensity ofthemultipleobservationsofsymmetry - relatedreflections .

The 4 - helix bundle has a more common right - handed up - down - up - down fold composed of sequential helices (cid:2) 4 to (cid:2) 7 ( equivalent to talin rod helices 31 to 34 ) ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . Helix (cid:2) 4 is the shortest with only 18 amino acids , whereas the other three have a similar length ( 26 – 28 residues ) and are connected by short loops . Helix (cid:2) 7 is kinked in the middle at Pro - 1564 ( Fig . 2 A ) , and the bottom of the helix orients toward the gap left by the shorter helix (cid:2) 4 stabilizing this region by interacting with the hydrophobic core ( Fig . 3 A ) . More - over , the bottom of the bundle is further stabilized by a cluster of four phenylalanines ( Phe - 1467 , Phe - 1525 , Phe - 1575 , and Phe - 1581 ) with Phe - 1581 from the C - terminal end capping the bundle ( Fig . 3 A ) . Also two residues from the N - terminal end , Leu - 1461 and Val - 1462 , inter - act with the hydrophobic core to compensate for the shorter helix (cid:2) 4 . The linker regions between the two bundles , residues 1451 – 1464 and 1578 – 1589 , form a two - stranded anti - parallel (cid:1) - sheet - like structure with complementary backbone hy - drogen bonding ( Gln - 1455 bonds with Gln - 1587 , Gln - 1458 , with Val - 1584 , and Leu - 1461 with Phe - 1581 ) ( Fig . 3 B ) . This arrangement keeps the two linker regions together lim - iting their flexibility , and this is sup - ported by the relatively low B - factor values observed for the linker region in the crystal structure . Further - more , hydrogen bonds are observed between side chains from the bot - tom of the 5 - helix bundle and back - bone residues from the linker re - gion , e . g . side chain Gln - 1382 with backbone Val - 1584 , side chain Tyr - 1445 with backbone Gly - 1457 , and backbone Val - 1381 with backbone Ala - 1586 ( Fig . 3 C ) . These interac - tions are likely to fix the relative ori - entation between the 5 - helix bundle and the linker region . However , such interactions are more limited between the 4 - helix bundle and the linker region , and we only observe a single hydrogen bond between the side chain of Arg - 1515 with back - bone Gln - 1459 . This would suggest a greater freedom of movement of the 4 - helix bundle relative to the linker region , and the B - factor values are higher than aver - age in the vicinity of Gln - 1459 and Ser - 1583 , which are on opposite sides of the sheet just before the 4 - helix bundle . The consequence of this unique arrangement of the 5 - and 4 - helix domains is that it interrupts the otherwise linear orga - nization of the helical bundle domains that make up the talin rod , and it seems likely that the 4 - helix bundle will protrude out of the rod ( Fig . 1 ) . Interestingly , all of the talin rod domains identified to date have an average calculated isoelectric point ( pI ) of (cid:3) 5 . 0 ( 4 . 4 – 6 . 1 ) , and this is also the case for this talin 9 - helix module ( pI of 5 . 76 ) . However , the two bundles have very different pI values , 4 . 6 and 7 . 8 for the 5 - and 4 - helix bundles , FIGURE2 . Crystalstructureoftalinrodresidues1359 – 1659 .

Structure of Talin Residues 1359 – 1659 29580 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 285•NUMBER 38• SEPTEMBER 17 , 2010 respectively . The electrostatic surface representation of the molecule ( Fig . 2 B ) shows a basic surface on the 4 - helix bundle that points away from the 5 - helix bundle , and this may be a functionally important feature of this region of the talin rod . ( The talin head domain also has a basic surface , and this inter - acts with acidic phospholipids ( 6 , 20 ) . However , the 9 - helix module does not bind negatively charged phospholipids vesi - cles in vitro ; data not shown . ) Talin 9 - Helix Module Is Relatively Compact in Solution —So - lution studies support the crystallographic data pointing to a “V - shape” arrangement of the two bundles in the 9 - helix mod - ule with limited flexibility , as judged by analytical gel filtration , NMR , and small angle x - ray scattering ( see supplemen - tal “Results” and supplemental Fig . S3 ) . Gel filtration shows that at a concentration of 50 (cid:4) M , the polypeptide is monomeric with an apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa , significantly higher than the calculated value ( 32 kDa ) indicative of a nonglobular con - formation ( large radius of gyration ) . Sequence Analysis —The residues in the linker regions be - tween the two bundles ( residues 1451 – 1464 and 1578 – 1589 ) are relatively well conserved across species ( supplemental Fig . S2 A ) suggesting that this region has an important struc - tural function ; perhaps it allows some flexibility between the two domains . The four phenylalanines ( Phe - 1467 , Phe - 1525 , Phe - 1575 , and Phe - 1581 ) that stabilize the 4 - helix bundle are also conserved . Phe - 1581 , which caps the C - terminal end of the bundle ( Fig . 3 A ) , is invariant in the talin sequences analyzed and is also conserved in MESDc1 ( supplemental Figs . S1 A and S2 A ) , implying that bundle capping is important in stabilizing the hydrophobic core . Phe - 1575 ( replaced by a tyrosine in Cae - norhabditis elegans talin ) and Phe - 1525 ( replaced by leucine in Drosophila talin ) are both substantially conserved . Phe - 1467 is less conserved , being replaced in both C . elegans and Drosoph - ila talin and in MESDc1 by leucine or valine , thus keeping the hydrophobic core intact . Two O - glycosylation sites have been identified in the talin rod , Thr - 1487 and Thr - 1890 ( 50 ) . Thr - 1487 is located within the 4 - helix bundle in a loop between helix (cid:2) 4 and (cid:2) 5 ( Fig . 2 A ) . This threonine is conserved in C . elegans talin and MESDc1 but not in Drosophila melanogaster talin ( supplemental Fig . S1 A and supplemental Fig . S2 A ) . The positioning of Thr - 1487 at the tip of the bundle and its conservation suggest that it may be biologically important , although the role of talin glycosylation has not been investigated . A number of phosphorylation sites have been mapped within human platelet talin ( 51 ) , and two of these ( Ser - 1461 and Ser - 1508 ) are located within residues 1359 – 1659 and are poten - tially phosphorylated by protein kinase C . Both of these serine residues are solvent - exposed in the crystal structure ; Ser - 1641 ( located in the middle of helix (cid:2) 9 ) is fully conserved in all talins as well as in MESDc1 ( supplemental Figs . S1 A and S2 A ) sug - gesting that phosphorylation of this residue might have an important biological role . However , Ser - 1508 in helix 5 is not conserved in other talins or in MESDc1 . Vinculin Binding —Talin ( 1359 – 1659 ) contains two potential VBS . The VBS in helix (cid:2) 9 contained in the 5 - helix bundle ( equivalent to talin rod helix 36 ) showed weak binding in the initial SPOT - peptide analysis , although we were able to crystal - lize it in complex with vinculin Vd1 ( 28 ) . In contrast , the VBS in helix (cid:2) 6 and contained in the 4 - helix bundle ( equivalent to talin rod helix 33 ) bound Vd1 quite strongly in the SPOT - peptide analysis ( 28 ) . As with all such VBS in talin , the residues involved in vinculin binding are buried in the hydrophobic core of the bundles ( 28 ) , and one of the factors that determines the activity of the VBS is the inherent stability of the bundle in which it is embedded ( 52 ) . Preincubation of the 9 - helix module with vinculin Vd1 ( 1 : 1 molar ratio ) followed by analytical gel filtration provided clear evidence of complex formation . Interestingly , binding occurred even at room temperature ( Table 2 and Fig . 4 C ) , in marked contrast to most other VBS - containing talin rod domains that only bind vinculin at higher temperatures ( 23 , 33 , 52 ) . To establish whether one or both bundles contain an active VBS , we cloned , expressed , and purified the two indi - FIGURE3 . Structuraldetailsofthelinkerregionbetweenthetwobundles .

The NMR spectrum of the 9 - helix module ( supplemen - tal Fig . S4 A ) shows good peak dispersion with the slight broadening expected from an extended domain in solution . The 1 H , 15 N HSQC spectra of the individual 5 - and 4 - helix bundles ( supplemental Fig . S4 , B and C ) show good peak dispersion with uniform intensity and line width , suggesting that they are correctly folded . Superimposition of the spectra of the individual domains with that of the 9 - helix module indicates that the two domains retain the same structural features when expressed on their own . Gel filtration showed that the purified 5 - helix bundle did not bind vinculin Vd1 even after preincubation at 45 °C for 30 min ( Fig . 4 A ) . In contrast , the purified 4 - helix bundle readily formed a complex with Vd1 even at 20 °C ( Fig . 4 B ) . Interestingly , the 4 - helix bundle on its own has a rather low melting temperature ( T m 42 °C , see Table 2 and Fig . 4 D ) when compared with the 5 - helix bundle ( T m of 59 °C ) , and this correlates with its ability to bind Vd1 at room temperature . However , the N - and C - ter - minal regions of the 4 - helix bundle are normally kept together by the preceding 5 - helix bundle , and this most likely stabilizes the domain . Indeed , the 9 - helix module melts in a single step with a T m of 53 °C , much higher than that of the isolated 4 - helix bundle ( T m 42 °C ) and somewhat lower than that of the isolated 5 - helix bundle ( T m of 59 °C ) .

Incubation of the 4 - helix ( B ) or 9 - helix polypeptides ( C ) with Vd1 resulted in complex formation . Preincubation of the proteins at 37 °C did not increase significantly the formation of a talin - Vd1 complex ( data not shown ) . No binding was observed with the 5 - helix bundle alone . D , denaturation profiles for the talin rod polypeptides were measured by monitoring the change in circular dichroism at 222 nm with increasing temperatures . Profiles are shown for the 9 - helix module ( squares ) , the 5 - helix bundle ( circles ) , and the 4 - helix bundle ( triangles ) . The melting temperature ( T m ) for each domain is indicated . Structure of Talin Residues 1359 – 1659 29582 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 285•NUMBER 38• SEPTEMBER 17 , 2010 SDS - PAGE showed the presence of both the complex and free talin and vinculin ( Fig . 4 C ) , indicative of an interaction that has intermediate affinity in the micromolar range . In contrast , mix - ing the isolated 4 - helix bundle with Vd1 resulted in quantitative complex formation ( Fig . 4 B ) consistent with tight binding in the nanomolar affinity range ( 53 ) . This suggests that stabilization of the 4 - helix bundle by incorporation in the 9 - helix module decreases its affinity for vinculin . Talin 9 - Helix Module Binds F - actin Both in Vitro and in Vivo — An F - actin - binding site was previously identified in the middle of the talin rod ( 25 ) , and we therefore tested the ability of the 9 - helix bundle to bind F - actin using a cosedimentation assay . As shown in Fig . 5 A , the 9 - helix polypeptide bound F - actin , albeit rather weakly , and about 30 % of the protein cosedi - mented with F - actin . Both domains were required for binding , because neither the 4 - nor 5 - helix bundles on their own cosedi - mented with F - actin , demonstrating that the basic surface observed on the 4 - helix bundle ( Fig . 2 B ) is not the sole deter - minant for F - actin binding . To establish whether the talin 9 - he - lix polypeptide bound F - actin in vivo , we expressed it as a GFP - tagged construct in NIH3T3 cells . Triton X - 100 extraction before fixation revealed a clear colocalization of the GFP - talin polypeptide with actin stress fibers ( Fig . 5 C ) . However , despite its ability to bind vinculin in vitro , the GFP - tagged polypeptide did not colocalize with vinculin in FAs ( data not shown ) . It has been reported previously that talin domains containing VBSs do not necessarily localize to FAs ; this has been shown with the IBS2 - A domain ( residues 1975 – 2135 ) ( 23 ) and even a rod frag - ment spanning residues 434 – 2197 , which consists of multiple domains and at least 10 VBSs ( 54 ) . Thus , it appears that FA localization of talin polypeptides containing VBSs depends upon additional factors . MESDc1 Is a Novel F - actin - binding Protein —Talin residues 1359 – 1659 show homology to the protein predicted to be encoded by the MESDc1 gene , which was originally identified as one of five candidate genes on mouse chromosome 7 impli - cated in mesoderm development ( 37 ) , although this activity was subsequently assigned to another gene . Inspection of the EST database shows that the MESDc1 mRNA is widely expressed , and MESDc1 protein is predicted to contain 362 amino acids . The N - terminal region ( residues 1 – 43 ) of MESDc1 has no homologues in the database , and secondary structure predic - tions suggest that this region forms a 24 - amino acid - long helix . The homology with talin is restricted to 301 amino acids at the C terminus of MESDc1 , and secondary structure prediction clearly indicates that residues 44 – 352 of MESDc1 have a simi - lar secondary structure to talin residues 1359 – 1659 ( supple - mental Fig . S1 A ) . We generated a three - dimensional model of MESDc1 ( supplemental Fig . S5 A ) using Modeler ( 55 ) with the crystal structure of talin as the template . We observed no important clashes , i . e . the hydrophobic residues are kept within the core of the model and charged residues are surface - ex - posed , suggesting that the model is plausible . One small differ - ence is the insertion of four amino acids in the MESDc1 sequence at the N terminus of helix (cid:2) 10 ( talin helix (cid:2) 9 , sup - plemental Fig . S1 A ) making the loop (cid:2) 9 - (cid:2) 10 slightly longer . The protein encoded by the MESDc1 gene has not been char - acterized , but recombinant MESDc1 expressed well in E . coli , and the protein was readily purified using standard methods . Circular dichroism measurements showed that it was largely (cid:2) helical ( Fig . 6 A ) , supporting our three - dimensional model , with a melting temperature of 62 °C ( Fig . 6 B ) , suggesting that it was folded correctly . Purified MESDc1 ( 50 (cid:4) M ) had a rather large apparent molecular mass ( 74 . 6 kDa ) as determined by gel filtration compared with a calculated value of 38 . 4 kDa ( data not shown ) . Although the talin 9 - helix module has a somewhat higher apparent molecular mass ( 39 kDa ) than the calculated value ( 32 kDa ) due to its extended conformation , the data on MESDc1 suggest that it may form a dimer in solution . MESDc1 contains an extra helix at the N terminus that could mediate dimerization , but its sequence does not show obvious signs of coiled - coil structure unlike the talin C - terminal dimerization helix ( 27 ) . We expressed and purified the N - terminal 43 amino acids of MESDc1 as thioredoxin fusion protein . Gel filtration shows that it is monomeric with a very similar elution profile to thioredoxin alone ( data not shown ) . Moreover , the 1 H , 15 N HSQC spectrum of this construct shows very sharp resonances with little dispersion for the MESDc1 amino acids , suggesting that this region is unfolded when expressed on its own . Given the homology between MESDc1 and the talin 9 - helix module , we tested its ability to bind F - actin and vinculin . Inter - estingly , MESDc1 bound to F - actin in a cosedimentation assay better than the equivalent talin domain , and (cid:3) 70 % of the polypeptide was found in the pellet ( Fig . 5 B ) . Analysis of the FIGURE 5 . Both the talin 9 - helix module and MESDc1 bind F - actin .

Structure of Talin Residues 1359 – 1659 SEPTEMBER 17 , 2010• VOLUME 285•NUMBER 38 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 29583 three - dimensional model of MESDc1 shows two small basic regions on the surface of the 4 - helix bundle ( supplemen - tal Fig . S5 B ) . In contrast , there is one large basic region on the surface of the talin 9 - helix module ( Fig . 2 B ) . Thus , surface charge does not explain why MESDc1 binds F - actin better than the equivalent talin domain in the cosedimentation assay . The possibility that MESDc1 is dimeric may be relevant in this regard , the C - terminal actin - binding site in talin only binds F - actin with high affinity as a dimer ( 27 ) . MESDc1 did not bind the vinculin Vd1 domain as deter - mined by gel filtration , even after incubation at 45 °C for 30 min ( Fig . 6 C ) . Comparison of the sequence of the VBS helices in the talin 9 - helix module with the overall consensus for VBSs in the talin rod and the equivalent helices in MESDc1 shows that the latter deviates from the consensus ( Fig . 6 D ) . The most important clashes in the MESDc1 sequence are local - ized in the first helical turn where hydrophobic residues are normally found in talin , whereas basic residues are found in the MESDc1 sequence ( Fig . 6 D ) . Consistent with the above find - ings , GFP - MESDc1 expressed in NIH3T3 cells colocalized with actin stress fibers ( Fig . 5 C ) but not vinculin - containing FAs ( data not shown ) ( 52 , 54 ) . DISCUSSION Here , we report the crystal structure of talin residues 1359 – 1659 that contains nine (cid:2) - helices that are organized into a unique fold with two distinct domains . The 5 - helix bundle is formedbynonsequentialhelices (cid:2) 1 , (cid:2) 2 , and (cid:2) 3followedby (cid:2) 8and (cid:2) 9 , whereas the 4 - helix bundle is composed of consecutive helices and is inserted between helices 3 and 4 of the 5 - helix bundle . The two bundles are connected by a linker that forms a two - stranded anti - parallel (cid:1) - sheet - like structure . This is a completely novel fea - tureofthetalinrodthatisotherwisecomposedofalineararrange - ment of 5 - and 4 - helix bundles . Because the 5 - helix bundle con - tains the N and C termini of this module , we propose that it is linkedbyshortloopstotheadjacenthelicalbundlesinthetalinrodviaend - to - end packing , whereas the 4 - helix bundle protrudes from the talin rod ( Fig . 1 ) ( 33 ) . Another novel feature of the module is that it contains a constitutively active VBS that binds vinculin Vd1 at room tem - FIGURE6 . BiochemicalcharacterizationofMESDc1 .

Structure of Talin Residues 1359 – 1659 29584 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 285•NUMBER 38• SEPTEMBER 17 , 2010 perature . Analysis of the isolated 4 - helix bundle shows that it also binds Vd1 at room temperature , whereas the VBS in the 5 - helix bundle is cryptic , like most other VBSs in the talin rod ( 23 , 32 , 52 ) . To date , the only other region of the talin rod that binds Vd1 at room temperature is the 4 - helix bundle spanning residues 755 – 889 ( 29 ) ; both these 4 - helix bundles are unique in that they have a cluster of threonine residues within their hydrophobic core ( supplemental Fig . S6 ) , and this likely mod - ulates the stability of the bundle , and hence the availability of the VBS . Indeed , we have shown that replacing the threonine cluster in talin ( 755 – 889 ) with hydrophobic residues markedly suppresses vinculin binding ( 52 ) . However , within the 9 - helix module , the termini of the 4 - helix bundle are kept together by the 5 - helix bundle , and CD melting experiments show this sta - bilizes the fold ; because unfolding the bundle is required for vinculin binding , this will decrease its affinity for vinculin , and this may explain why Vd1 binding to the 9 - helix module has a lower affinity than binding to the isolated 4 - helix bundle . How the various VBS behave within the context of full - length talin remains to be explored . We have previously suggested that activation of the cryptic VBSs in the talin rod might be triggered by force exerted on integrin - talin - actin complexes ( 52 ) , and experimental evidence in support of the idea of force - induced activation of the VBSs in talin has recently come from elegant in vitro studies using mag - netic tweezers ( 56 ) . Vinculin stabilizes FAs by cross - linking talin to F - actin or to membrane phospholipids ( 57 , 58 ) , and perhaps the fact that two of the VBSs in talin are activated more readily than others allows for a graduated recruitment of vin - culin in response to progressive increases in force . However , expression of vinculin Vd1 alone in vinculin null fibroblasts has been shown to lead to larger and more stable FAs even in the absence of actomyosin contraction , an effect that was depen - dent on the ability of Vd1 to bind talin ( 59 ) . This suggests that mechanisms that regulate exposure of the talin - binding site in vinculin may also drive the interaction of vinculin with talin , and it will be interesting to establish whether the two domains containing constitutively active VBSs in talin are involved in this response . The 9 - helix module also binds F - actin , although neither the 4 - nor 5 - helix bundles alone are able to bind . This raises the possibility that vinculin might bind to the VBS in the 4 - helix bundle via its N - terminal Vd1 domain leaving the C - terminal vinculin tail to bind to the F - actin bound to the talin 9 - helix module . This may stabilize the interaction between the talin 9 - helix bundle and F - actin , which on its own is rather weak . Although this remains to be investigated , what is clear is that several regions of talin , including the talin head ( 60 ) , and at least two regions in the talin rod have the ability to bind F - actin ( Fig . 1 ) ( 25 ) . Much attention has focused on the C - terminal actin - binding site in talin ( 26 , 27 ) , which is homologous to the Hip1R family of actin - binding proteins ( 61 ) , and our recent data show that it plays an essential role in the assembly of FAs ( 65 ) . How - ever , we have shown that the talin C - terminal actin - binding site , which is dimeric , binds along a single actin filament and does not cross - link F - actin ( 27 ) . Therefore , it seems unlikely that the C - terminal actin - binding site accounts for the ability of talin to cross - link F - actin ( 62 ) , and actin - binding sites else - where in the talin molecule , including that in the 9 - helix mod - ule , may be relevant in this regard . Similarly , recent studies on filamin show that apart from the well characterized actin - bind - ing site in the N - terminal calponin homology domain , Ig repeats 9 – 15 in the filamin rod also bind F - actin and increase the overall avidity of filamin for F - actin ( 63 ) . Previous studies have shown that the central part of the talin rod ( residues 1327 – 1948 ) binds the 312 - amino acid insert ( SNTIII ) present within the muscle variant of the intermediate filament protein (cid:2) - synemin ( 38 ) . Using the same overlay assay used above , we have shown that both the 4 - and 5 - helix bundles present in the talin 9 - helix module bind SNTIII indicating that there are two (cid:2) - synemin - binding sites in this region of talin ( see supplemental “Results” and supplemental Fig . S7 ) . It is note - worthy that SNTIII also binds the vinculin tail , but this is com - petitive with talin binding ( 64 ) . Talin residues 1359 – 1659 show homology to residues 44 – 352 of the protein encoded by the MESDc1 gene , and this region of MESDc1 is predicted to have a similar secondary structure to talin . Indeed we have generated a homology model of MESDc1 using the crystal structure of the talin residues 1359 – 1659 . Proteins with similar folds often have very differ - ent functions , but it is striking that both proteins bind to F - ac - tin , and GFP - tagged MESDc1 colocalized with actin stress fibers when expressed in NIH3T3 cells . However , MESDc1 does not bind to vinculin , and analysis of the MESDc1 sequence shows that helices 7 and 10 ( equivalent to the VBS helices in talin ) diverge from the VBS consensus sequence ( 28 ) . Interest - ingly , MESDc1 binds to F - actin better than does the talin 9 - he - lix module . Gel filtration experiments indicate that MESDc1 is dimeric in solution , and the NMR HSQC shows broad signals ( data not shown ) , consistent with this conclusion . The C - ter - minal actin - binding site in talin is also dimeric , and dimeriza - tion is important for high affinity actin binding ( 26 , 27 ) . Thus , the fact that MESDc1 is also dimeric may contribute to its higher affinity for F - actin . However , although the MESDc1 mRNA appears to be widely expressed , there is no literature on the role of this novel actin - binding protein in cells . In summary , we show that residues 1359 – 1659 from the cen - tral region of the talin rod have a novel structure quite different from that of other regions of the talin rod or any other protein in the Protein Data Bank . It contains binding sites for vinculin , F - actin , and the muscle - specific isoform of the intermediate filament protein (cid:2) - synemin , and this and its unusual fold sug - gest that it plays an important role in the function of talin . Moreover , we predict that the previously uncharacterized pro - tein MESDc1 will have a similar structure , and we demonstrate that it also binds F - actin .
