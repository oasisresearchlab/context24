Chiang 3 Received : 10 April 2019 / Revised : 22 August 2019 / Accepted : 2 September 2019 / Published online : 12 September 2019 © Islamic Azad University ( IAU ) 2019 Abstract The effects of both climate change and the geographic location of Taiwan have influenced the perceived variability of river flow and increased uncertainty and complexity in the management of river basins . In this study , a genetic algorithm ( GA ) optimizer was integrated into a stochastic river basin model to develop a stochastic optimization river basin management model ( SORBMM ) . Firstly , the flow probability density function was determined through statistical analysis of the hydrologi - cal data . A Monte Carlo simulation was then conducted to evaluate the effect of flow variability , and a GA was implemented to obtain an optimal river pollution reduction strategy . A true case involving multi - objective management of a river basin under conditions of high spatiotemporal flow variation was tested to demonstrate the feasibility of the SORBMM . The results revealed that a reduction in pollution removal would lead to higher risks for river basin management due to the dilution effect in the river downstream and the objective of lowering pollution removal costs . Keywords Genetic algorithm · Monte Carlo simulation · Climate change · River basin management · Uncertainty Introduction The random nature of river flow has a major effect on pol - lution control and water resources management , and thus an increased emphasis has been placed on streamflow esti - mation ( Mehr et al . 2015 ) . Global warming and climate change have also played a role in affecting rainfall inten - sity , and this has exacerbated the spatiotemporal variability of river flow ( de Medeiros et al . 2019 ) . Many researchers have aimed to outline the relationships between streamflow , rainfall , climate change , and land use ( Amin et al . 2013 ; Baloch et al . 2015 ; Novotny and Stefan 2007 ) . To effectively manage water resources in river basins , system analysis is recommended to coordinate the individual features of each river basin and so determine the effectiveness of pollution prevention measures on unstable water resources ( Chen and Chang 1998 ) . For example , linear programming has suc - cessfully been used to deal with waste load allocation and pollution permit trading ( Havens and Schelske 2001 ) . Various studies have incorporated the uncertainties involved in water resource management models by employ - ing probability theory , fuzzy theory , stochastic procedures , and Bayesian model , respectively , to address the complexi - ties of real - world problems ( Karmakar and Mujumdar 2007 ; Ketabchi and Ataie - Ashtiani 2015 ; Li and Huang 2009 ; Zhang et al . 2015 ) . A Gaussian process emulation method has also been proposed for quantifying the uncertainty dis - tribution of groundwater flow ( Crevillén - García et al . 2017 ) . Wang et al . ( 2016 ) further incorporated fractile criterion and chance - constrained programming to deal with uncertainties in water resources planning ( Wang et al . 2016 ) . Monte Carlo ( MC ) simulation is a popular stochastic process used to quantify the risk probability of decisions with a given con - fidence interval ( Freeman et al . 2019 ; Liu et al . 2008 ) , and to propagate the probability density functions ( PDFs ) of the parameters ( Amelian et al . 2019 ; Kunstmann and Kastens 2006 ; Muzik 2002 ) . To reduce the risk of flooding , an urban ensemble flood simulation was used to assess the dynamic interaction between a manhole , a sewer pipe , and surface Editorial responsibility : J Aravind . * Y . - H .

Volpi et al . ( 2012 ) used MC simulation to determine the spatial distribution of rainfall and explored the influence of rainfall patterns on the hydrological response of river basins ( Volpi et al . 2012 ) . Based on streamflow PDFs , MC simulation was used to determine the effect of streamflow on urban basins and to assess the impact of urbanization on streamflow ( Mejía et al . 2015 ) . In addition , government authorities could pro - pose some control strategies , such as total maximum daily loading ( TMDL ) and water intake control , to improve water safety . Variations of flow and the implementation of water resource control strategies could increase the complexity and uncertainty of planning in water resource management ( Kasiviswanathan and Sudheer 2013 ; Xu et al . 2010 ) . In other words , a variety of nonlinear dynamic functions exist between river pollutant loadings and water quality ( Qin et al . 2013 ) . Therefore , providing a stochastic model to quantify the potential impact of flow variability and presenting alter - native optimal management strategies for river basin man - agement are essential in order for policy makers to be able to make well - informed decisions . This study aimed to ( 1 ) uti - lize MC sampling to document the impact of river flow vari - ability and ( 2 ) present a stochastic optimization river basin management model ( SORBMM ) by combining a genetic algorithm ( GA ) , MC simulation , and a river basin manage - ment model . A river basin management case involving mul - tiple objectives and a high spatiotemporal flow variation was tested to demonstrate the feasibility of the SORBMM . This study chose the Kao - Ping River basin in southern Taiwan as case study and collected its hydrological data from 1982 to 2003 . Materials and methods Case study and river basin management model The Kao - Ping River shown in Fig . 1 is the main source of drinking water and originates from four small tributaries : the Chi - San River , Liao - Nung River , Cho - Kou River , and Ai - Liao River . However , the quality of the water supply in the midstream and downstream watercourses of the Kao - Ping River system has been compromised due to pollution from factories and the inappropriate disposal of manure from pig farms in the area ( Chen and Chang 1998 ; Ning et al . 2001 ) . In this case study , streamflow data were collected from seven hydrological stations ( Taiwan Environmental Water Qual - ity Information Database 2019 ) , namely H 1 – H 7 stations . Descriptive statistics , such as mean , min , max , and stand - ard deviation ( SD ) of streamflow , were calculated to show the effects of global warming , climate change , and Taiwan’s topography on the variability of river flow . The central ten - dency of streamflow was determined using the mean value ( ̄ x ) , and the formula for its calculation is expressed in Eq . ( 1 ) where x j is each sample j and n is the number of samples . Range defines the spread , or variability , of a sample and is described by the min and max values of the sample . The variance of a sample is thus defined by Eq . ( 2a ) . The square root of the variance is the SD , and this is defined by the fol - lowing Eq . ( 2b ) ( Keppel 1991 ) : where s 2 is the sample variance , ̄ x is the sample mean , and x j is the j th sample . During the monsoon period of this case study , the flow increased to a level approximately 8 – 12 times greater than the flow during the dry season and this increases the uncer - tainty and complexity involved in water quality management of the Kao - Ping River basin ( Chen and Chang 2010 ) . Man - agement of the Kao - Ping River basin was chosen for this case study to demonstrate the feasibility of the SORBMM model . In order to develop an effective TMDL management strat - egy of the Kao - Ping River basin , the basin area was concep - tualized and divided into four stream sections comprising 85 units with each unit being 2 km long , as shown in Fig . 2 . Twenty - three point sources of discharge were identified , as well as eighteen water intake zones . Some units , such as unit 63 , have more than one point source of pollution discharge , or more water intake zones . The index Biochemical Oxy - gen Demand ( BOD ) was used to indicate the quality of the river water . To ensure effective management of the Kao - Ping River basin , it was essential to determine the appropriate BOD removal rate in specific units . The initial quality of the mixed water samples from each unit was derived from the mass balance Eq . ( 3 ) as depicted in the schematic diagram in the inset of Fig . 2 , where C 0 , i represents the initial mixed BOD concentration in the i th unit ( mg / L ) , C in , i is the input BOD concentration ( mg / L ) from the front i th unit , Q in , i is the input flow rate ( 1 ) ̄ x = ∑ nj = 1 x j n ( 2a ) s 2 = ∑ nj = 1 � x j − ̄ x � 2 n − 1 ( 2b ) SD = √√√√ ( n ∑ j = 1 [ x j − ̄ x ] 2 ∕ n − 1 ) ( 3 ) C 0 , i = C in , i × Q in , i + C w , i × Q w , i Q in , i + Q w , i 1065 International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology ( 2020 ) 17 : 1063 – 1074 1 3 from the front unit ( cms ) , C w , i is the discharge BOD con - centration of wastewater in the i th unit ( mg / L ) , and Q w , i is the discharge flow rate of wastewater in the i th unit ( cms ) . Once the pollutants had been incorporated , the BOD reac - tion kinetics in each river unit could be expressed in Eq . ( 4 ) . Several kinetic reaction equations , such as first - order , three - halves - order , and second - order reaction , could be used for evaluating BOD removal , and first - order reaction kinetic is the most likely to faithfully describe the BOD data ( Liolios et al . 2012 ; Roider and Adrian 2007 ) .

The coefficients and parameter values for each unit of the Kao - Ping River are ( 4b ) t i = L i v i ( 4c ) v i = a i Q b i i Fig . 1 Location and environ - mental system of case study 1066 International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology ( 2020 ) 17 : 1063 – 1074 1 3 shown in Table 1 .

Genetic algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation In its original form , a GA is a randomized search proce - dure to find exact or approximate solutions to optimiza - tion problems , and GA - based optimizers have been used to solve multi - objective programming problems , such as issues Fig . 2 The schematic diagram of Kao - Ping River basin and mass balance insert of river unit 1067 International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology ( 2020 ) 17 : 1063 – 1074 1 3 T a b l e 1 I n f o r m a ti on a nd p a r a m e t e r f o r K a o - P i ng R i v e r b a s i n U n it a P o ll u ti o n a m oun t ( kg / d ) D i s c h a r g e ( c m s ) I n t a k e ( c m s ) R e gu l a - ti on ( m g / L ) D e ox i d a - ti on r a t e , K l P a r a m e t e r U n it a P o ll u ti on a m oun t ( kg / d ) D i s c h a r g e ( c m s ) I n t a k e ( c m s ) R e gu l a - ti on ( m g / L ) D e ox i d a - ti on r a t e , K l P a r a m e t e r a i b i a b 1 2170 . 3 3 19 . 03 0 . 077 1 0 . 2 – – 44 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 2 – – 0 . 327 1 0 . 2 – – 45 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 3 – – 0 . 327 1 0 . 2 – – 46 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 4 – – 0 . 327 1 0 . 2 – – 47 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 5 – – 0 . 327 1 0 . 2 – – 48 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 6 – – 0 . 327 1 0 . 2 – – 49 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 7 – – 0 . 327 1 0 . 2 – – 50 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 8 – – 0 . 327 1 0 . 2 – – 51 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 9 – – 0 . 327 1 0 . 2 – – 52 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 10 – – 1 . 083 1 0 . 2 0 . 311 0 . 293 53 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 11 – – 1 . 083 1 0 . 2 0 . 311 0 . 293 54 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 12 – – 1 . 083 1 0 . 2 0 . 311 0 . 293 55 – – 2 0 . 3 0 . 115 0 . 516 13 – – – 1 0 . 2 0 . 311 0 . 293 56 – – 2 0 . 3 0 . 115 0 . 516 14 0 0 4 . 978 2 0 . 2 0 . 311 0 . 293 57 – – 2 0 . 3 0 . 115 0 . 516 15 – – 2 0 . 2 0 . 311 0 . 293 58 – – 2 0 . 3 0 . 115 0 . 516 16 – – 2 0 . 2 0 . 311 0 . 293 59 1325 . 24 3 . 08 2 0 . 3 0 . 115 0 . 516 17 – – 2 0 . 2 0 . 311 0 . 293 60 2 0 . 3 0 . 237 0 . 256 18 – – 2 0 . 2 0 . 311 0 . 293 61 1848 . 33 5 . 01 2 0 . 3 0 . 237 0 . 256 19 – – 2 0 . 2 0 . 311 0 . 293 62 2046 . 64 4 . 2 1 . 089 2 0 . 3 0 . 237 0 . 256 20 – – 2 0 . 2 0 . 311 0 . 293 63 488 . 95 1 . 08 2 0 . 3 0 . 237 0 . 256 21 – – 2 0 . 2 0 . 311 0 . 293 64 – – 2 0 . 3 0 . 237 0 . 256 22 – – 2 0 . 2 0 . 311 0 . 293 65 – – 2 0 . 3 0 . 237 0 . 256 23 – – 2 0 . 2 0 . 311 0 . 293 66 1604 . 66 2 . 68 2 0 . 3 0 . 237 0 . 256 24 668 . 52 6 . 19 12 . 455 1 0 . 2 0 . 509 0 . 062 67 682 . 27 1 . 23 2 0 . 3 0 . 237 0 . 256 25 – – 12 . 455 2 0 . 2 0 . 509 0 . 062 68 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 237 0 . 256 26 – – 12 . 455 2 0 . 2 0 . 509 0 . 062 69 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 421 0 . 141 27 – – 12 . 455 2 0 . 2 0 . 509 0 . 062 70 – – 0 . 1 0 . 421 0 . 141 28 – – 12 . 455 2 0 . 2 0 . 509 0 . 062 71 68 . 34 0 . 14 0 . 1 0 . 421 0 . 141 29 – – 12 . 455 2 0 . 2 0 . 509 0 . 062 72 0 0 0 . 1 0 . 421 0 . 141 30 – – 2 0 . 2 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 73 – – 0 . 1 0 . 050 0 . 509 31 1728 10 0 . 2 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 74 10 . 37 0 . 04 0 . 1 0 . 050 0 . 509 32 – – 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 75 15 , 623 . 9 15 . 39 14 . 022 0 . 1 0 . 050 0 . 509 33 – – 1 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 76 – – 0 . 1 0 . 050 0 . 509 34 – – 1 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 77 – – 0 . 1 0 . 050 0 . 509 35 – – 1 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 78 – – 0 . 1 0 . 050 0 . 509 36 – – 1 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 79 – – 0 . 1 0 . 050 0 . 509 1068 International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology ( 2020 ) 17 : 1063 – 1074 1 3 relating to sewerage rehabilitation , energy facility allocation , green building design , and wasteload reallocation ( Lin et al . 2016 ; Yang et al . 2016 , 2017 ) . The GA method uses stand - ard procedures including initiation , evaluation , selection , crossover , and mutation to improve populations over time and identify optimal solutions to problems . In this way , new generations of new solutions are formed each time based on their fitness values . In this case study , several PDFs were generated based on various statistics relating to river flow . MC sampling was repeatedly conducted to generate river flow sequences in the river basin in order to conduct a probabilistic risk assessment . Stochastic optimization river basin management model Figure 3 outlines the analytical framework of the SORBMM used in this study . First , the objectives and constraints of water quality management were defined . In this case study , two objectives , namely the maximization of river water qual - ity and the minimization of pollution control costs , were identified . The collected environmental parameter data , such as streamflow rate , were analyzed based on different statistical distributions , and statistical software was used to fit the envi - ronmental parameters and create PDFs . In this case study , statistical distributions including extreme value , Weibull , inverse Gaussian , extreme value , gamma , and Expon , were tested , and then SORBMM was used to select the most applicable PDF to represent the spatiotemporal character - istics of the uncertain streamflow rate . In total , seven PDFs of hydrological stations ( HPDFs ) were generated , and then a confidence interval of the HPDFs was estimated . Con - fidence interval ( CI ) and confidence level are related , and both were computed from the observations . A 95 % CI means that if we were to take 100 different samples and compute a 95 % CI for each sample , then 95 of the 100 samples would contain the mean value . Usually , a 95 % CI is expressed in the way shown in Eq . ( 5 ) . Detailed methods of calculating confidence intervals can be obtained by reference to ( Alt - man 1998 ) . Based on these HPDFs , using a 95 % confidence inter - val , a MC random sampling simulation was used to create a streamflow rate that represents river flow rate in the same units of measurement as the hydrological stations ( Q is ) . The other flow rate units , between two hydrological stations ( Q i ) , were calculated based on the water balance . In a MC simu - lation , if the parameters meet the constraints , such as the regulation of water intake , then an optimization program is ( 5 ) ̄ x ± 1 . 96SD n T a b l e 1 ( c on ti nu e d ) U n it a P o ll u ti on a m oun t ( kg / d ) D i s c h a r g e ( c m s ) I n t a k e ( c m s ) R e gu l a - ti on ( m g / L ) D e ox i d a - ti on r a t e , K l P a r a m e t e r U n it a P o ll u ti on a m oun t ( kg / d ) D i s c h a r g e ( c m s ) I n t a k e ( c m s ) R e gu l a - ti on ( m g / L ) D e ox i d a - ti on r a t e , K l P a r a m e t e r a i b i a b 37 – – 1 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 80 23 , 896 . 5 23 . 01 2 . 533 0 . 1 0 . 050 0 . 509 38 – – 1 . 692 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 81 6500 . 39 2 . 8 0 . 1 39 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 82 – – 0 . 1 40 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 83 – – 0 . 1 41 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 84 15 , 552 20 0 . 1 42 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 85 – – 0 . 1 43 – – 2 0 . 1 0 . 691 − 0 . 063 T o t a l 11 . 39 105 . 0 T h e un it w it hou t c on t a m i n a ti on i s no t li s t e d a T h e nu m b e r o f r i v e r un it s i s s ho w n i n F i g . 2 1069 International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology ( 2020 ) 17 : 1063 – 1074 1 3 implemented using a GA to optimize the control strategy of the river basin , but if these conditions are not met , the MC simulation is restarted to input appropriate river flows in the units . In a GA optimization procedure , the GA input param - eters include population size , chromosomes , number of generations , mutation probability , crossover probabil - ity , and termination criteria . In this case study , the deci - sion variables ( control strategy of the river basin ) were defined as the reduction levels of BOD loading in several river water quality control units and could be considered a design requirement of wastewater treatment plants at these Fig . 3 Flowchart of the SORBMM model for river basin management under uncertainty 1070 International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology ( 2020 ) 17 : 1063 – 1074 1 3 units . The chromosomes in the population were encoded in binary numbers and the decision variables , and fitness of the population was represented as objective values . The optimization algorithm only stopped once it had satisfied the desired iteration in the GA and determined an optimal solution / control strategy set . According to these procedures , the steps were repeated until the termination criterion was reached and set as a maximum generation size . Finally , the statistical and risk analysis software , @ RISK , was used to analyze all the optimal solutions , and the test results showed estimations were valid using a 95 % CI . This @ RISK is an add - into Microsoft Excel and is a widely applied MC simu - lation tool for risk analysis ( Palisade - Corporation . 2015 ) . The detailed mathematical formulas used in the SORBMM for this case study are expressed in Eqs . ( 6 ) – ( 8 ) : Two objectives ( a ) and ( b ) : ( a ) Maximization of river quality that meets regulatory standards Maximize ( b ) Minimization of pollution treatment costs Minimize Subject to where C s , i is the legal effluent BOD concentration of the i th unit ( mg / L ) , Cost k is the pollution treatment cost of the specific k th pollution point source ( $ million / year ) , C ok and C k are the untreated and treated wastewater BOD concen - trations of the k th pollution point source , respectively . Q k is the discharge flow rate of the k th pollution point source ( as shown in the upper right inset of Fig . 2 ) . Therefore , R k is the ( 6 ) 85 ∑ i BC out , i ( 7a ) TK ∑ k = 1 Cost k ( 7b ) Cost k = 58 . 82 D 0 . 8 k ( 7c ) D k = Q k ( C ok − C k ) ( 7d ) R k = C ok − C k C ok ( 8a ) BC out , i ∈ { 1 , if C out , i ≤ C s , i 0 , if C out , i > C s , i } , ∀ i ( 8c ) 0 ≤ R k ≤ 0 . 85 ( 8d ) Q is ∈ HPDFs decision variable in the GA optimizer for determining the BOD removal rate in the k th pollution point source , and its maximum rate of 85 % for bio - treatment . If the concern is for improved water quality or for water that would be safe for human consumption , then Eq . ( 9 ) would be used and Eq . ( 8a ) would be substituted for Eq . ( 10 ) : where Q d , i is the flow rate of water intake in the i th unit ( cms ) . Similarly , the sum of the rates at which the water quality of the river units met regulatory standards was referred to as the “achieving rate , ” and the correlation between pollution treatment costs and the achieving rate could further be discussed by adding the constraints into a SORBMM . Based on the HPDFs of 95 % CI and 10 , 000 iterations of MC simulation , the thousands of optimized BOD pollution removal scenarios at a given point source can be obtained . Thus , a possible range of water quality of the river unit and pollution removal allocation can be estimated , and each water quality of the river unit will fall within the 95 % con - fidence threshold . Various scenarios relating to environ - mental planning and management could be designed using a SORBMM , and the feasibility of the SORBMM could be evaluated to support the decision - making process . Results and discussion The impact of flow variation on river water quality and water intake rights Table 1 shows the pollution amount ( kg / d ) , wastewater dis - charge ( cms ) , water intake ( cms ) , and water quality regula - tion ( mg / L ) of each unit . Total wastewater discharge and water intake of Kao - Ping River are 11 . 4 cms and 105 . 0 cms , respectively . Tables 2 and 3 show the variance analysis of flow rate and the correlation analysis of the hydrological sta - tions in the Kao - Ping River basin . In Table 2 , the statistical results of the long - term flow data from the H 1 station rep - resented an “extreme value” distribution and the high SD of flow indicated that the flow rate in the watershed near the H 1 station displayed high temporal variability and uncertainty . Similar results were observed in the other stations and most notably in the H 4 station which had the highest SD of flow due to the convergence of the four streams in the Kao - Ping ( 9a ) Q i ≥ Q d , i ( 9b ) BC out , i ∈ { 1 , if Q d , i ≤ Q in , i 0 , if Q d , i > Q in , i } , ∀ i ( 10 ) BC out , i ∈ { 1 , 000 , 000 , if C out , i ≤ C s , i 0 , if C out , i > C s , i } , ∀ i 1071 International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology ( 2020 ) 17 : 1063 – 1074 1 3 River downstream . Similarly , a high spatial dependence between each of the hydrological stations was observed . These results demonstrated that the daily flow rates in the Kao - Ping River basin during the dry season show temporal variability and a spatial correlation with the neighboring measuring stations ( Table 3 ) . Such flow uncertainty would cause a high degree of uncertainty and complexity for the Kao - Ping River basin management . The MC sampling efforts were based on these HPDFs and used to quantify the daily flow in each river unit , and these flow rates were then considered initial conditions for the SORBMM . First , the results from the MC simulation were used to examine the reliability of water rights and the water quality of each river unit as shown in Tables 4 and 5 . Table 4 reveals that the reliability of satisfying water intake in sev - eral units ( 10 , 15 , 17 , 55 , 56 , 60 , and 73 ) was less than 60 % due to the variability of river flow . Table 5 shows the proba - bility of river unit water quality meeting standard regulations for river water quality , and most of the water in the Liao - Nung River upstream is of a poor quality and that there was less than a 50 % chance of the Chi - San River downstream ( units 59 – 68 ) providing water of a quality that met regula - tory standards . It also showed that two river units ( 80 and 81 ) in the Kao - Ping River downstream had an even lower probability of meeting the regulatory standards . When the results in Table 4 were compared to the results in Table 5 , it was found that unit 60 would be exposed to a higher risk of poor quality water due to a lowered water intake in unit 60 and a lower probability of the water in unit 59 meeting regu - latory standards . The MC simulation for river water rights and quality showed that flow uncertainty had a significant influence on water intake and quality , and this suggests that promotion of a TMDL program and optimal management Table 2 ANOVA and probability density functions of flow rate in Kao - Ping River a HPDFs Probability density functions of hydrological stations b unit : cms Flow Hydrological stations H 1 H 2 H 3 H 4 H 5 H 6 H 7 HPDFs a Extreme value Weibull Inverse gaussian Extreme value Gamma Expon Inverse Gaussian Mean ( ̄ x ) b 6 . 77 19 . 96 7 . 02 50 . 82 2 . 87 10 . 31 3 . 76 Standard devia - tion ( SD ) 11 . 68 27 . 15 15 . 62 86 . 57 14 . 81 28 . 06 8 . 52 Min 0 . 10 0 . 35 0 . 03 9 . 00 0 . 00 0 . 01 0 . 20 Max 223 . 00 460 . 00 265 . 00 1440 . 00 529 . 00 397 . 00 234 . 00 Table 3 Correlation analysis of hydrological stations in Kao - Ping River * The correlation coefficient reached the 95 % level of significance Hydrological stations H 1 H 2 H 3 H 4 H 5 H 6 H 7 H 1 1 H 2 0 . 83 * 1 H 3 0 . 96 * 0 . 86 * 1 H 4 0 . 78 * 0 . 58 * 0 . 73 * 1 H 5 0 . 78 * 0 . 59 * 0 . 76 * 0 . 93 * 1 H 6 0 . 85 * 0 . 64 * 0 . 79 * 0 . 84 * 0 . 90 * 1 H 7 0 . 51 * 0 . 52 * 0 . 32 * 0 . 41 * 0 . 44 * 0 . 46 * 1 Table 4 Reliability analysis of water right for demand intake The unit without water intake is not listed Unit Available probability ( % ) Unit Available probability ( % ) 10 0 48 94 1 98 50 89 12 91 53 91 15 5 55 0 17 0 56 25 22 63 60 0 38 95 73 0 43 96 76 100 46 96 79 100 1072 International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology ( 2020 ) 17 : 1063 – 1074 1 3 strategies for river restoration are of the utmost importance in order to ensure water security . Applications of the SORBMM for management of the Kao‑Ping River basin In order to provide appropriate river management strategies in the face of river discharge uncertainty and to assess the feasibility of the proposed SORBMM , the pollution removal ( BOD ) rates of different river units were evaluated using a SORBMM to determine whether they met two major man - agement objectives—providing water of a high quality and treating wastewater pollution at the lowest possible cost . In SORBMM , the uncertainty of flow rate of the river unit was mainly quantified by sampling values from the upper and lower limits of the 95 % CI of the HPDFs , and then the BOD removal rate of each river unit was optimized . The predicted results of pollution removal allocation for the Kao - Ping River basin are shown in Table 6 and Fig . 4 . Based on examination of 95 % CI , the total amount of pollution removed and the cost of pollution treatment was 55 , 799 . 9 ( kg / d ) and 18 , 272 . 8 ( $ million / year ) , respectively ( Table 6 ) . Figure 4 shows the water quality of the longest river unit under the stochastic design flow . The location of the river mouth is given as unit 85 , and the point furthest from it is given as unit 1 . In a statistical sense , the 95 % CI is the interval that encloses the mean of the future values of many replicate mean BOD prediction values , with a Table 5 The probability that river unit water quality meets standard regulation Unit Probability ( % ) Unit Probabil - ity ( % ) Unit Prob - ability ( % ) 1 0 34 91 60 46 2 0 35 94 61 23 3 0 36 95 62 13 4 0 37 96 63 23 5 0 38 96 64 39 6 0 39 98 65 51 7 0 40 98 66 40 8 0 41 98 67 44 9 0 42 98 68 53 10 0 43 98 69 98 11 0 44 98 70 98 12 0 45 98 71 98 13 100 46 98 72 98 14 100 47 98 73 98 15 100 48 98 74 98 16 100 49 98 75 87 17 100 50 98 76 95 18 100 51 98 77 97 19 100 52 98 78 97 20 100 53 98 79 98 21 100 54 98 80 44 22 100 55 98 81 49 23 100 56 98 82 72 31 100 57 98 83 85 32 100 58 98 84 97 33 63 59 34 85 97 Table 6 Pollution removal allocation for Kao - Ping River basin The unit without contamination is not listed a Unit number shown in Fig . 2 b allowable maximum daily pollution load c pollution removal total amount ( kg / day ) Unit a Pollution amount ( kg / day ) Removal rate ( % ) Pollution treatment cost ( $ million / year ) 1 2170 . 3 83 . 7 2170 . 2 31 0 . 6 65 . 8 1 . 4 33 1728 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 00 59 1325 . 2 69 . 3 1190 . 9 61 1848 . 3 41 . 6 1018 . 0 62 2046 . 6 73 . 9 1848 . 3 63 489 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 00 66 1604 . 7 0 . 0 0 . 00 67 682 . 3 0 . 0 0 . 00 71 68 . 3 0 . 0 0 . 00 74 10 . 4 0 . 0 0 . 00 75 15 , 623 . 9 0 . 0 0 . 00 80 23 , 896 . 5 53 . 3 12 , 043 . 9 81 6500 . 4 0 . 0 0 . 00 84 15 , 552 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 00 Total 73 , 546 . 6 b 55 , 799 . 9 c 18 , 272 . 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 B OD ( m g / L ) Distance to river mouth ( km ) Prediction Standard Regulation Approximate 95 % Confidence Level Fig . 4 The predicted result of water quality in the longest river unit of Kao - Ping River basin under the stochastic design flow 1073 International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology ( 2020 ) 17 : 1063 – 1074 1 3 confidence of 95 % . This is for a specified mean predic - tion value obtained by analysis of a large number of flow rate samples . More precisely , for a 95 % confidence inter - val , the upper and lower limits of the BOD of the long - est river unit are shown in Fig . 4 . For example , given a 95 % confidence interval , the upper and lower BOD limits of unit of 34 were 1 . 3 and 0 . 04 mg / L , respectively ; both of them were below the regulation amount . An interest - ing observation is that some units , such as units 75 and 84 , showed higher levels of pollution and yet were not required to reduce pollution levels . This could be attrib - uted to the dilution effect on the river downstream and to more emphasis being placed on the objective of lowering pollution removal costs . Figure 4 shows that higher probability and variability existed in the downstream section of the Kao - Ping River that was less than 15 km from the river mouth . This would violate water BOD regulations and was possibly due to the large number of pollution point sources in the area . How - ever , in sections of the river far from the area downstream ( > 20 km ) , the water quality ( BOD ) was close to meeting standard regulations and displayed lower variability due to the decrease in flow variability . The results in Fig . 4 show that the river downstream would still be at risk of exposure to water of a poor quality and this is consistent with the evidence that spending less on pollution control results in a higher risk to water safety . The simulated results showed a range of water quality achievement rates in the Kao - Ping River basin ( Fig . 5 ) , and thus it follows that increasing the achievement rates would result in an increase in pollution treatment costs . The economics of water quality manage - ment in Fig . 5 show that the most cost - effective pollution treatment ( valued at around 20 , 000 $ million / year ) would lead to water quality achievement rates close to 98 % . The above results also demonstrate that the proposed SORBMM is a useful model for river basin management operating under flow uncertainty . Conclusion A successful environmental management model needs to be based on a careful cost – benefit analysis in order for those in management positions to make informed decisions regard - ing environmental maintenance programs , such as programs relating to increased water quality , the lowering of uncer - tainties and the reduction of pollution emissions in a cost - effective manner . Global climate change and the geographic location of Taiwan have both had a clear effect on the vari - ability of the environmental parameters , such as river flow rate , and this has resulted in higher levels of uncertainty in environmental management . This study demonstrated a MC simulation that sampled from the PDFs of the environ - mental parameters and then evaluated the influence of those parameters on environmental planning and management . Furthermore , a proposed SORBMM that integrated MC simulation with a GA optimizer was conducted to test opti - mal multi - objective management strategies for the Kao - Ping River basin affected by discharge uncertainty . The results of the MC simulation show that uncertainty of river flow has a significant influence on water intake . It also shows that most of the water in the Liao - Nung River upstream is of a poor quality and that the probability of the water in the Chi - San River downstream meeting regulatory standards is less than 50 % . These results show that urgent attention needs to be given to the promotion of a TMDL program as well as to optimal river management and restoration strategies in order to ensure water security . Although the application of optimal management strategies for the Kao - Ping River basin demonstrated that the SORBMM is a useful model for envi - ronmental management under conditions of uncertainty , the results revealed that a reduction in pollution removal could lead to a higher risk for river basin management dealing with uncertainty of flow discharge . This is possibly due to the dilution effect in the river downstream as well as the focus on the objective of lowering pollution removal costs . Further research should focus on using a SORBMM to discuss the various scenarios designed for management of the Kao - Ping River basin and should take into account the uncertainty of the river flow as well as multi - objective management . In addition , other reaction equations could be also integrated into this SORBMM in the future .
