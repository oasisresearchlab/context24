Eukaryotic cells contain multiple Hsp70 proteins and DnaJ homologues . The partnership be - tween a given Hsp70 and its interacting DnaJ could , in principle , be determined by their cellular colocaliza - tion or by specific protein - protein interactions . The yeast SCJ1 gene encodes one of several homologues of the bacterial chaperone DnaJ . We show that Scjlp is located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , where it can function with Kar2p ( the ER - lumenal BiP / Hsp70 of yeast ) . The region common to all DnaJ homologues ( termed the J domain ) from Scjlp can be swapped for a similar region in Sec63p , which is known to interact with Kar2p in the ER lu - men , to form a functional transmembrane protein component of the secretory machinery . Thus , Kar2p can interact with two different DnaJ proteins . On the other hand , J domains from two other non - ER DnaJs , Sislp and Mdjlp , do not function when swapped into Sec63p . However , only three amino acid changes in the Sislp J domain render the Sec63 fusion protein fully functional in the ER lumen . These results indi - cate that the choice of an Hsp70 partner by a given DnaJ homologue is specified by the J domain . O , ~ E major class of constitutive and stress - induced pro - teins in all cell types consists of ATP - binding proteins of 70 kD termed HspT0s . Members of the Hsp70 family are found in the bacterial cytoplasm as well as in subcompartments of the eukaryotic cell . One function of Hsp70s is to mediate the folding and assembly of protein complexes ( Pelham , 1986 ) . BiP , the Hsp70 of the ER lumen ( Munro and Pelham , 1986 ) , binds to newly synthesized pro - teins as they pass across the ER membrane from their site of synthesis in the cytoplasm ( Sanders et al . , 1992 ) . Cyto - solic Hsp70s stimulate protein translocation across ER and mitochonddal membranes ( Deshaies et al . , 1988 ; Mura - kami et al . , 1988 ; Chirico et al . , 1988 ) . Heat shock proteins in the mitochondrial matrix are involved in import , proper folding , and assembly of proteins once they have crossed the inner membrane ( Kang et al . , 1990 ) . In Escherichia coli , the activity of DnaK , the cytoplasmic Hsp70 , is modulated by DnaJ and GrpE . Together , DnaK , DnaJ , and GrpE are necessary for proper assembly of pro - teins at the origin of ~ , DNA replication ( Liberek et al . , 1989 ; Zylicz et al . , 1989 ; Alfano and McMacken , 1989 ) and Address all correspondence to Pamela A .

Risse ' s present address is Hofmann - LaRoche , Ban 205 , CH - 4002 Basel , Switzerland . similarly for P1 plasmid replication ( Wickner et al . , 1991 ; Wickner et al . , 1992 ) . DnaK and DnaJ together are also im - portant for protein export ( Wild et al . , 1992 ) and folding of nascent polypeptides ( Langer et al . , 1992 ; Hendrick et al . , 1993 ) . One proposal is that DnaJ is necessary to stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK , which in turn drives protein assembly / folding reactions ( Liberek et al . , 1991 ) . A second nonexclusive possibility is that DnaJ helps to target DnaK to its substrate . Only within the past 5 y have eukaryotic DnaJ homologues been identified , thus generalizing the DnaK - DnaJ interac - tion of eukaryotes . The first DnaJ of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to be described with Sec63p ( also termed NpUp ) , a membrane protein component of the ER translocation ma - chinery ( Sadier et al . , 1989 ; Rothblatt et al . , 1989 ; Feldheim et al . , 1992 ; Kurihara and Silver , 1992 ) . Sec63p contains only 70 amino acids that are similar to the NH2 terminus of E . coli DnaJ . These amino acids are embedded between two membrane - spanning regions and exposed on the lumenal side of the ER membrane where they interact with Kar2p , the yeast BiP homologue ( Normington et al . , 1989 ; Rose et al . , 1989 ; Brodsky and Schekman , 1993 ; Scidmore et al . , 1993 ) . These findings led to the prediction that this region forms the J domain , which is sufficient for interaction of DnaJs with Hsp70s . Sequence comparisons of additional DnaJs have supported this proposal ( Silver and Way , 1993 ) . Moreover , the NH2 - terminal 108 amino acids of E . coli © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 95 / 05 / 979 / 10 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , Number 4 , May 1995 979 - 988 979 on F eb r ua r y 21 , 2013 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published May 15 , 1995 DnaJ were recently shown to be sufficient to stimulate DnaK ATPase activity ( Wall et al . , 1994 ) . Other DnaJs from yeast include Sislp , located in the cytoplasm and the nucleus ( Luke et al . , 1991 ; Zhong and Amdt , 1993 ) , Ydjlp , located in both the cytoplasm and the outer surface of the ER membrane ( Caplan and Douglas , 1991 ; Atencio ' and Yatfe , 1992 ) , and Mdjlp , located in the mitochondrial matrix ( Rowley et al . , 1994 ) . Each of these can be predicted to interact with particular Hsp70s at each location and has been shown directly for Ydjlp ( Cyr et al . , 1992 ; Cyr and Douglas , 1994 ) and See63p ( Brodsky and Schekman , 1993 ; Scidmore et al . , 1993 ) . It may be that each Dnal interacts with a certain Hsp70 and / or that specificity is achieved by colocalization . The SCJ1 gene of the yeast S . cerevisiae encodes a protein with 40 % identity to bacterial DnaJ over its entirety ( Blum - berg and Silver , 1991 ) . SCI1 could encode 27 NH2 - terminal amino acids that were suggested to act as a mitochondrial targeting sequence . These are followed by a second in - frame methionine and ' ~ 20 additional amino acids that could func - tion as a signal sequence for translocation across the ER . Furthermore , the ER retention sequence , KDEL ( Munro and Pelham , 1987 ) , occurs at the Scjlp COOH terminus , al - though HDEL is the preferred signal in yeast ( Semenza et al . , 1990 ) . We now present data indicating that most , if not all , of Scjlp is located in the lumen of the ER , where it interacts with Kar2p / Bip . Furthermore , by replacing the J region of Sec63p with that from Scjlp , Sislp , and Mdjlp , we show that the J domain contains the information necessary for specific interaction with its Hsp70 partner . Materials and Methods Plasmids and Yeast Strains Plasmids YEpSCJ1 and YEpSCJIAECORI ( SCJ1 truncated after codon 273 ) were described before ( Blumberg and Silver , 1991 ) . Plasmid YCpSCJI con - tains the 1 , 700 - bp Kpnl / SnaBI fragment of YEpSCJ1 ( 550 - bp 5 ' sequence , 1 , 134 - bp coding sequence , and 15 - bp 3 ' sequence ) in the SrnaI site of the CENt / LEU2 plasmid pRS315 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . Plasmid YCpg - SCJ1 contains an oligonucleotide - derived insertion ( 5 ' - CA ~ T ' I ~ T - TCG - 3 ' coding for an N - linked glycosylation signal ) in the unique NcoI site of YCpSCI1 . Plasmid pSP - SCJI contains the PCR - generated coding se - quence ( starting with the signal sequence ) of SCJ1 as a BamHI / XbaI frag - ment in pSP65 ( Promega Corp . , Madison , WI ) . The entire coding region was sequenced by the chain termination method ( Sanger et ai . , 1977 ) to confirm the absence of mutations . A maltose - binding protein ( MBP ) m - Scjl fusion protein is encoded by pMAL - SCJ1 . The coding sequence of SCJI was inserted between the StuI and SalI sites of pMALc ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA ) . Plasmid YCpSEC63 containing the entire SEC63 gene was a kind gift of R . Schekman ( University of California , Berkeley , CA ) . Plasmid YCpSEC63 - NC is derived from pRS315 and contains two PCR - generated SEC63 gene fragments : the regiom 5 ' and 3 ' of the J domain but not the coding sequence of the J domain itself . The 783 - bp XbaI / BamHI 5 ' segment includes the promoter and the NH2 - terminal 124 codons and spans SEC63 positions - 409 to + 374 . The 1 , 607 - bp HindIII / XhoI 3 ' segment contains codous 200 - 663 plus 205 bp of 3 ' sequence . Plasmids YCpSEC63 - J - SCII , YCpSEC63 - J - SIS1 , and YCpSEC63 - J - MDJ1 contain the J domains of SCJ1 , SIS1 , and MDJI , respectively , as 200 - bp PCR - derived BamHI / HindIH frag - ments inserted into YCpSEC63 - NC , creating fusions with the SEC63 read - ing frame . The entire coding region of SEC63 and all the J legions were sequenced to confirm the absence of mutations . YCpSEC63 - SUC2 plas - raids contain all but the last 14 codom of the SEC63 fused to the coding sequence of cytosolic invertase . The PstI / PvuII fragment of pTKI . 0 ( Kuri - 1 . Abbreviation used in this paper : MBP , maltose binding protein . hara and Silver , 1992 ) was inserted into plasmids YCpSEC63 - J - SCJ1 , YCpSEC63 - J - SIS1 , and YCpSEC63 - J - MDJI , which were treated with PstI , XhoI , and Klenow polymernse . The following yeast strains were used : wild - typo strain W303 ( MA ~ ura3 - 52 1eu2 - 3 , 112 ade2 - I trpl - I ) , PSY173 ( ASCJI [ Blumberg and Silver , 1991 ] , MA ~ um3 - 52 1eu2 - 3 , 112 trpl - I ade2 ade3 SCJI : : URA3 ) , PSY97 ( MATa ura3 - 52 leu2 - 3 , H2 see63 - 1 ) , PSY76 ( MA ~ ura3 - 52 1eu2 - 3 , 112 trpl - 1 see63 - 101 ) , PSY43 ( Sadler et al . , 1989 ; MA ~ / a um3 - 52 / um3 - 52 leu2 - 3 , 112 / leu2 - 3 , 112 ade2 - 101 / + trplAl / + SEC63 : : URA3 / + ) , PSY662 ( MATa ura3 - 52 1eu2 - 3 , 112 trplAl SEC63 : : URA3 + plasmid YCpSEC63 - J - SO / ) , MBYI2 - 6D ( MATa ura3 - 521eu2 - 3 , 112 trpl seclS - I ) , MYI76 ( MATa ura3 - 52 kar2 - 159 ) , MS1378 ( MATc ~ ura3 - 52 kar2 - 133 ) , and MS1000 ( MATc ~ uro3 - 52 kar2 - 1 ) . Site - directed Mutagenesis A point mutation in the DNA region coding for the J domain in Sec63 - J - Sislp was obtained by a method that relies on homologous recombination in yeast ( Ma et al . , 1987 ) . Yeast cells were transformed with plasmid YCpSEC63 - J - SIS1 linearized with HindIII ( at the 3 ' border of the J region ) , and excess amounts of PCR products ( 200 - fold molar excess ) , which served as substrates for plasmid repair . The mutagenic 5 ' PCR primer 5 ' - GCC - AACAGGTGACACAGAAAAGTTTGTCGAGATCTCAGAGC ~ CTT - TGAAATT - 3 ' contains flanking homologous sequence ( permitting recom - bination on the 5 ' end and priming on the 3 ' end ) , the silent restriction site BgllI , and changes codon 42 ( see Fig . 8 B ) of the J domain of Sec63 - J - Sislp from Lys to Val . The 3 ' PCR primer contains SEC63 wild - type sequence . DNA recovered from random yeast colonies served as templates for analyti - cai PCR reactions ( using an oligonucleotide that anneadas to the 5 ' border of the SISI J region and the 3 ' SEC63 primer ) . About 50 % of the PCR prod - ucts contained the new BgllI site . Plasmids prepared from E . coli trans - formants were sequenced in their J region to confirm the mutations and used for transformation of temperatere - semitive sec63 strains . The same strategy was used to mutate Gin 13 to Arg and Lys 17 to Set Here the oligo - nucleotide 5 ' - GGAGTATCTC CAAGTGCTAATGAGAGAGAAC ' IGAAA - TCCGGATATAGAAAAGCAGCTCTA - 3 ' , which also introduces a BspEI site , was used as 5 ' PCR primer . Cell Fractionation Mitochondria were prepared from wild - type strain D273 - 10B grown over - night in lactate medium and harvested at 1 . 5 A6OO ~ m according to the pro - cedure of Daum et al . ( 1982 ) . Isolated crude mitoehondria were stored in buffer A ( 20 mM Helms , pH 7 . 2 , 0 . 6 M sorbitol ) comaining 10 mg / ml fatty acid - free BSA . Further purification by density gradient centrifugadon was according to Lewin et ai . ( 1990 ) . The following published procedures were used : preparation of microsomal membranes and cytosol ( Caplan and Douglas , 1991 ) with modification by Rowley et al . ( 1994 ) ; and digitonin frac - tionation ( Hard et al . , 1986 ) . Production of Antibodies Antibodies specific to Scjlp were prepared as follows . MBP fused to Scjlp ( MBP - Scjlp ) was purified from an E . coil overproducing strain by amylose affinity chromatography according to the instructions of the manufacturer ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA ) and injected into New Zealand white rabbits . Antibodies were purified from sera by ammonium sulfate precipita - tion , dialysis into PBS , and absorption against an E . coil extract coupled to CnBr - activatad sepharose followed by a yeast extract from a strain miss - ing SCJ1 ( PSY173 ) similarly coupled to CnBr - activated Sepharose . Finally , the antibodies were affinity purified by chromatography on a column con - taining MBP - SCJ1 coupled to CnBr - activated Sepharose . The generation of other antibodies is described in Rowley et al . ( 1994 ) and Zollner et al . ( 1992 ) . Other Methods DNA techniques , SDS - PAGE , and immunoblots using the ECL detection kit ( Amersham Corp . , Arlington Heights , IL ) were performed according to standard methods ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ) . Immunofluorescence was per - formed as described ( Bossie et al . , 1992 ) with anti - Scjlp afffinity - purified antibody ( 1 : 100 ) followed with FITC - conjugated anti - rabbit secondary anti - bodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Inc . , West Grove , PA ) at a dilution of 1 : 500 .

( Boehringer Mannheim Corp . , Indianapolis , IN ) in the absence or presence of dog pancreas microsomes ( Boehringer Mannheim Corp . ) were per - formed according to the instructions of the manufacturers and as previously reported by Hansen et al . ( 1986 ) . Protease protection assays ( proteinase K concentration 50 # g / ml ) were as described in Schlenstedt et al . ( 1990 ) . Results Localization of Scjlp To better establish the intracellular distribution of Scjlp , high - titer affinity - purified anti - Scjlp antibodies were gener - ated against a MBP - Scjlp fusion protein purified from an E . coli overproducing strain . These antibodies do not bind to any proteins on immunoblots when used to probe a yeast extract from a strain deleted for SCJ1 ( Fig . 1 , lane 4 ) . How - ever , when the same strain carried SCJ1 on a single - copy plasmid , a 40 - kD protein was recognized that corresponds to Scjlp ( Fig . 1 , lane 1 ) . Cells containing SCJ1 on a mul - ticopy plasmid produce more Scjlp ( Fig . 1 , lane 3 ) . Extracts from cells bearing a plasmid encoding a truncated version of Scjlp contain a 31 - kD protein ( Fig . 1 , lane 2 ) . Immunofluoreseence with the anti - Scjlp antibodies was used to localize Scjlp . In wild - type cells , the antibodies stained predominantly a region around the rim of the nucleus ( Fig . 2 , A - C ) . A similar staining pattern is observed when yeast cells are probed with antibodies against other ER - localized proteins ( e . g . , Rose et al . , 1989 ; Kurihara and Sil - ver , 1993 ) . No staining was observed when anti - Scjlp anti - bodies were used to probe cells missing SCJ1 ( Fig . 2 , D - F ) . To further investigate the subcellular localization of Scjlp , fractions enriched in mitochondria , ER , and cytosol were analyzed by immunostaining for the abundance of Scjlp and various marker proteins . Scjlp was found in both mitocbon - drial and ER fractions , but was not present in the cytosol ( Fig . 3 A ) . The protein was enriched in the ER fraction similar to a marker protein for this compai - tment ( Kar2p ) , whereas cytochrome cl heme lyase ( CC1HL ) of the mito - chondriai inner membrane was detectable only within the mitochondrial fraction . This suggested that at least some Scjlp cofractionated with the ER . However , the data left open whether the presence of Scjlp in the mitochondrial fraction was exclusively due to contaminating ER mem - branes . We therefore asked whether part of Scjlp present in mitochondria can be localized to one of the organelle ' s sub - compartments . To this end , isolated mitochondria were sub - fractionated by treatment with digitonin , which preferen - tially solubilizes the mitochondrial outer membrane ( as well as the membrane of the ER ) , whereas the mitochondriai in - ner membrane is only solubilized at higher concentrations of digitonin ( Hartl et al . , 1986 ) . As a result , soluble compo - nents are sequentially released from the organdies , while membrane - bound proteins become susceptible to attack by added protease . As shown in Fig . 3 B , Scjlp became accessi - ble to protease at low concentrations of digitonin . Thus , it behaved like proteins located in the intermembrane space Figure 2 .

( A ) Analysis of cell fractions . The indicated amounts of protein corresponding to cytosolic , micro - somal , or mitochondrial fractions were applied to SDS - PAGE . The mitochondriai fraction was also analyzed for the indicated marker proteins after further purification by density gradient centrifugation ( DGC ) . Proteins were visualized by immunostaining of nitrocellu - lose blots with antibodies against CCIHL , Scjlp , Kar2p , and fruc - tose 1 , 6 - bisphosphatase ( FBP ) . ( B ) Digitonin fractionation of the mitochondrial fraction . 200 # g mitochondria in 20 # 1 of buffer A were mixed with the indicated concentrations of digitonin ( added from a 20 - fold stock solution in buffer A ) . Treatment for 3 min at 0°C was in the presence or absence of 125 # g / ml proteinase K ( PK ) . Samples were diluted by adding 4 vol of buffer A . After 30 min on ice , 1 ml of buffer A containing 1 mM PMSF was added , and membranes were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 9 , 000 g . Analysis for the indicated marker proteins was as in A . Data were quantitated by densitometry . Cyt b2 , cytochrome b2 ; Mpilp , a mitochondrial matrix protein ; Kar2p , ER lumen . plained by a high - ER contamination of the mitochondria used in those studies . Support for at least a partial ER loca - tion also came from earlier results showing that fusion pro - teins containing the Scjlp NH2 terminus fused to invertase are Suc + , suggesting that the NH2 terminus could function as a signal for ER translocation ( Blurnberg and Silver , 1991 ) . Scjlp is normally not glycosylated , as determined by a lack of potential N - linked glycosylation sites and its behavior dur - ing gel electrophoresis , where it migrates at 40 kD , the pre - dicted molecular mass ( Fig . 4 B , lane 1 ) . To further test the idea that Scjlp is in fact in the lumen of the ER , a mutated version that contains a consensus site for glycosylation was constructed by inserting the amino acids GNSSH between His173 and Gly174 ( Fig . 4 A ) . When the mutated gene was expressed in yeast that otherwise lacked SCJ1 , the mutant Scjlp ( gScjlp ) migrated slower ( at 43 kD ) than wild - type Scjlp when extracts were assayed by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti - Scjlp antibodies ( Fig . 4 B , lane 2 ) . When cells were incubated with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin , the mutated Scjlp shifted in molecular mass ( Fig . 4 C , lanes 5 - 8 ) and migrated like wild - type un - glycosylated Scjlp ( Fig . 4 C , lanes 1 - 4 ) . Enzymatic diges - tion of the mutant Scjlp by EndoH yielded a protein that mi - grates at 41 kD consistent with removal of glycosyl units ( data not shown ) . These data indicate that most , if not all , Scjlp must gain access to the lumen of the ER , where the mutant protein is glycosylated . Tunicamycin treatment stimulates the production of Scjlp ( Fig . 4 C , lanes 1 - 4 ) . Wild - type Scjlp levels increase ap - proximately fourfold ( as determined by densitometry ) after 4 h of tunicamycin treatment . This is consistent with the ( CC ~ HL or cytochrome b2 ) or the ER ( Kar2p ) , but not - like the matrix protein Mpilp ( Maarse et al . , 1992 ) . Treatment of the mitochondrial fraction in hypotonic solution leads to swelling of the mitochondria , thereby rupturing the outer membrane but leaving the ER membrane intact . Protease treatment after osmotic swelling indicated Scjl was not in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria , suggesting local - ization in the microsomal contamination ( data not shown ) . To further evaluate the distribution of Scjlp , the mitochon - drial fraction was subjected to additional purification by den - sity gradient centrifugation ( Fig . 3 A ; Lewin et al . , 1990 ) . This procedure removes most contaminating membranes as well as damaged mitochondria . Purification resulted in at least a 25 - fold depletion of both Scjlp and Kar2p , whereas the content in CCLHL was virtually unchanged . Taken to - gether , these results support a localization for Scjlp primar - ily in the ER . Thus , the previous report of a mitochondrial localization of Scjlp ( Blumberg and Silver , 1991 ) is ex - Figure 4 . Glycosylation of mutant form of Scjlp .

Scjlp Is Cleaved upon Import into the ER Scjlp produced by translation in a reticulocyte lysate mi - grates slightly slower than wild - type Scjlp ( Fig . 6 , lane 1 ) and is fully sensitive to protease treatment ( Fig . 6 , lane 2 ) . In the presence of canine pancreas microsomes , the in vitro synthesized Scjlp is processed to a smaller species as deter - mined by relative migration on SDS - polyacrylamide gels ( Fig . 6 , lane 3 ) . In addition , the lower processed form be - comes resistant to added protease ( Fig . 6 , lane 4 ) unless de - tergent is added to disrupt the microsomal membranes ( Fig . 6 , lane 5 ) . These results are consistent with Scjlp having a cleavable signal sequence that targets it across the micro - somal membrane . A higher molecular weight form of Scjlp accumulates in yeast KAR2 mutants that are thermosensitive for protein translocation across the ER membrane . Extracts were pre - pared from kar2 - 159 and sec18 mutants grown at either the permissive temperature of 230C or for 2 . 5 h at the nonper - missive temperature of 37°C and examined by immunoblot - ting for the presence of Kar2p ( Fig . 7 , top ) and Scjlp ( Fig . 7 , bottom ) . As has been previously observed ( Vogel et al . , 1990 ) , pre - Kar2p accumulates in kar2 - 159cells that were in - cubated at the nonpermissive temperature ( Fig . 7 , lane 4 ) . Similarly , a protein comigrating with the in vitro synthesized precursor was observed in extracts from kar2 - 159 cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature ( Fig . 7 , lane 4 ) . This result is consistent with the notion that Scjlp is made as a higher molecular weight precursor in vivo and that its ability to be processed and translocated into the ER is blocked in KAR2 mutants . Mitochondrial precursor pro - teins , such as pre F ~ - ATPase , did not accumulate in kar2 - 159 cells at the nonpermissive temperature ( data not shown ) . Some preScjlp was also observed to accumulate in sec61 mutants at the nonpermissive temperature ( data not shown ) . Figure 6 . Processing of preScjlp - and assembly of Scjlp in micro - somes in reticulocyte lysates .

Reactions were divided into aliquots and further incubated without proteinase K , with pro - teinase K , or with proteinase K and 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 as indicated . The samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and fluorography . Figure 7 . Accumulation ofpreScjlp in kar2 mutants . Yeast cultures of temperature - sensitive strains sed8 ( lanes 1 and 2 ) and kar2 - 159 ( lanes 3 and 4 ) were grown at 23°C . The cultures were divided , half was fur - ther incubated for 2 . 5 h at 23°C , and half at 37°C as indicated . Ali - quots were removed and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting using anti - Kar2p antibodies ( top ) or anti - Scjlp antibodies ( bottom ) . On the other hand , no obvious accumulation of preScjlp or preKar2p was observed in mutants of $ EC18 ( Fig . 7 , lane 2 ) , which acts later in the secretory pathway ( Novick et al . , 1981 ) . Scrip Can Interact with Kar2p Via a Region Conserved in All DnaJs Because DnaJs are predicted to interact with Hsp70s , Kar2p , the Hsp70 of the ER lumen , is the likely functional partner of Scjlp . No other Hsp70 has been reported to reside within the ER lumen . To test this idea , we attempted to construct double mutants containing a deletion of SCJ1 ( ASC . J1 ) and temperature - sensitive alleles of SEC61 , SEC62 , SEC63 , KAR2 , SSC1 ( encoding the mitochondrial matrix Hsp70 ) , and also a strain deleted for SEC71 ( Deshaies et al . , 1988 ; Sadler et al . , 1989 ; Rothblatt et al . , 1989 ; Craig et al . , 1989 ; Kurihara and Silver , 1993 ) . For SEC61 , SEC62 , SEC63 , SEC71 , and SSC1 , the double mutants were always viable at both 25°C and 30°C . The same was true for double mutants containing ASCJ / and the temperature - sensitive kar2 - 1 and kar2 - 133 alleles ( Scidmore et al . , 1993 ) ; they were viable at 25°C and 30°C ( Table I ) . In contrast , double mutants deleted for SCJ1 and containing the kar2 - 159 thermosensitive allele ( Vogel et al . , 1990 ) were not viable , suggesting a synthetic lethal relationship ( Table I ) . Taken together , these data suggests that Scjlp is located in the ER lumen where it can interact with Kar2p , the lumenal Hsp70 cognate of yeast . Sec63p is an ER membrane protein that has been shown to interact with Kar2p by both genetic and biochemical means ( Brodsky and Schekman , 1993 ; Scidmore et al . , 1993 ) . Sec63p spans the ER membrane three times with the region of DnaJ homology located in the ER lumen , but essentially all of the remainder of the protein is located in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 8 A ; Feldheim et al . , 1992 ; Kurihara and Silver , 1992 ) . This predicts that the J domain mediates the interaction of Sec63p with Kar2p . Moreover , a single amino acid change in a conserved alanine in this re - gion ( Fig . 8 B ; Nelson et al . , 1993 ) eliminates the ability of Sec63p to interact with Kar2p ( Brodsky and Scheknum , 1993 ) . Since this also corresponds to the region common to all DnaJs , we predicted that this domain will mediate inter - action between DnaJs and their respective Hsp70 partners ( Silver and Way , 1993 ) . The following experiments were de - signed to test this hypothesis . A chimeric protein was constructed that contains amino acids 25 - 89 of Scjlp in place of the lumenal DnaJ domain of Sec63p ( Fig . 8 , A and B ) . That this protein was made in Schlenstedt et al .

All spores were allowed to germinate at 25 " C , and then checked for growth at 30 " C . t Genotypes were determined by segregation of URA3 and temporature - sensitive markers . For each double - mutant cross , three ganotype combinations are shown . Top to bottom , they represent parental ditype , tetratype , and nonparental ditype . Crosses of Ascjl to see63 - 1 and sec71 - 1 strains always yielded four viable spores at both room temperature and 300C , indicating a lack of synthetic lethality . yeast cells was confirmed by immtmoblots of whole - cell ex - tracts with the anti - Scjlp antibody ( Fig . 9 A , lanes 2 and 4 ) . A protein of the predicted size ( 75 kD ) that reacted with anti - Scjlp was present only in cells containing the chimeric gene . The chimeric gene encoding Sec63 - J - Scjlp was introduced into sec63 - 1 and sec63 - 101 temperature - sensitive alleles . Each mutant strain cannot grow at nonpermissive tempera - ture of 36 " C unless it contains a funetionai SEC63 gene ( Fig . 9 , C and D ) . Mutant strains harboring plasmids expressing the See63 - J - Scjlp chimeric protein also grew at the nonper - missive temperature , indicating that this protein could re - place Sec63p in these strain backgrounds ( Fig . 9 , C and D ) . Moreover , Sec63 - J - Scjlp could function as the only version of See63p in a haploid cell ( Fig . 9 A ) . Cells deleted for SEC63 are inviable . The plasmid encoding Sec63 - J - Scjlp was introduced into a heterozygous diploid strain containing only one copy of SEC63 . The other copy has been deleted from the chromosome by insertion of the URA3 gene ( Sadler et al . , 1989 ) . Normally , only the Ura - viable spores are re - covered when this strain is sporulated . However , when the diploids containing Sec63 - J - Scjlp were sporulated , tetrads containing three and four viable spores were obtained . The Ura + spores always contained the plasmid bearing the chi - meric gene ( data not shown ) . Swapping of J Domains Defines the Specificity of Their Interaction with HspTOs One question with regard to how DnaJs function is how they interact with certain Hsp70s .

Alternatively , specificity could be conferred by intracellular location . To test these possibilities , we constructed two additional Sec63p chimeric proteins , one containing the J region from Mdjlp and the other containing the J region from Sislp . Since anti - bodies to the J domains of Mdjlp and Sislp do not exist , ex - pression of the chimeric proteins was tested by gene fusions in which the SUC2 gene was fused to the SEC63 chimeric genes ( Kurihara and Silver , 1992 ) . If expressed , 128 - kD proteins should be produced that have the proper membrane orientation and , in the case of Sec63p , can function ( Feld - heim et al . , 1992 ) . For Sec63 - J - Scjlp ( Fig . 9 B , lane 2 ) , Sec63 - J - Sislp ( Fig . 9 B , lane 3 ) , and Sec63 - J - Mdjlp ( Fig . 9 B , lane 4 ) , all were produced as chimeric proteins of the cor - rect size that reacted with anti - invertase antibodies . This confirmed that the chimeric proteins could be made in yeast . Each chimeric gene was introduced into sec63 - 1 , sec63 - 101 , and SEC63 / ASEC63 cells . When tested for growth at the nonpermissive temperature , neither the Sec63 - J - Mdjlp or the Sec63 - J - Sislp chimeric protein could restore growth to sec63 - 1 or sec63 - I01 at the nonpermissive temperature ( Fig . 9 , C and D ) . Moreover , no viable spores were obtained that were missing the chromosomal copy of SEC63 . Taken to - gether , these results indicate that two J domains from non - ER - resident proteins cannot function when placed into Sec63p , but the domain from Scjlp , which is predicted to in - teract with Kar2p , can function . The sequence of the four J domains used in the swap ex - periments are presented in Fig . 8 B . Sequence comparison of Sec63p and Scjlp , which both can function with Kar2p , with Mdjlp and Sislp , which do not function , reveals that amino acids at positions 3 , 6 , 13 , 17 , 23 , and42 are conserved between Sec63p and Scjlp but differ in Mdjlp and Sislp . To further define the requirements for the J domain to function , we mutated the three most nonconserved amino acids in Sec63 - J - Sislp by site - directed mutagenesis to encode the corresponding Sec63 J domain amino acids ( Fig . 8 B ) . The hybrid protein Sec63 - J - Sislp containing both mutations Glnl3 to Arg and Lysl7 to Ser were not capable of restoring growth to sec63 temperature - sensitive mutants ( Fig . 9 D ) . The mutated protein where Lys42 was converted to Val is partially functional ( Fig . 9 D ) . However , the Sec63 - J - Sislp hybrid containing the three mutations combined ( Glnl3 to Arg , Lysl7 to Set and Lys42 to Val ) fully rescues the tem - perature - sensitive growth defect of sec63 - 1 and sec63 - 101 strains ( Fig . 9 D ) . Discussion We have presented results from several different experiments that show that Scjlp is located in the ER lumen . These data make Scjlp the second DnaJ homologue to be present in the ER lumen along with Sec63p . The J domain of Sec63p can be successfully replaced with that of Scjlp to make a func - tional protein that can interact with Kar2p . Substitution of other J domain into Scc63p results in chimeric proteins that are not functional and allow for the prediction of which amino acids confer specificity to the Kar2p interaction . Localization of Scjlp in the ER Scjlp was originally identified by its ability to alter the sort - ing of a normally nuclear targeted protein ( Blumberg and Silver , 1991 ) . It was the first eukaryotic DnaJ homologue found to contain similarity to bacterial DnaJs over its en - tirety . However , its actual function in the cell has remained an enigma . This is , in part , because a strain deleted for SCJ1 has not obvious growth defect , and uptake of proteins into the nucleus , mitochondria , and ER appears normal ( Blum - berg , H . , and P . A . Silver , unpublished results ) . Schlenstedt et al . DnaJ Homologue Functions in Endoplasmic Reticulum 985 on F eb r ua r y 21 , 2013 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published May 15 , 1995 Compared with other DnaJ homologues , Scjlp contains an extra 20 or 45 amino acids at its NH2 terminus depending on where translation begins . If the first methionine were used , then the first 25 amino acids would have a high degree of similarity to sequences for targeting proteins to the mito - chondria . However , initiation at the second methionine would produce a protein with , 020 amino acids that could function as a signal sequence for translocation into the ER . Results presented here show that Scjlp is localized in the ER lumen . Like most proteins that are translocated across the ER membrane , Scjlp is made as a higher molecular weight precursor that is processed to its mature form . Data from both in vitro translation experiments and accumulation of a higher molecular weight precursor in a mutant blocked in ER translocation support this conclusion . Because the in vitro translation product possessed only the second methio - nine , we conclude that it is the 20 amino acids succeeding it that are acting as the Scjlp signal sequence . Two DnaJs May Function with Kar2p Several lines of evidence support an interaction between Sec63p and Kar2p in the ER lumen . Mutant forms of Kar2p can be isolated that restore the ability of sec63 - 1 mutants to grow and temperature - sensitive mutations in KAR2 and SEC63 form synthetic lethal combinations ( Scidmore et al . , 1993 ) . Complexes containing Sec63p and Kar2p can be iso - lated that can restore ER protein translocation activity to microsomes prepared from a see63 - 1 strain ( Brodsky and Schekman , 1993 ) . The association of Kar2p with Sec63p de - pends on the nucleotide - bound state of Kar2p and is dis - rupted by a single amino acid change in the J domain present in the sec63 - 1 allele ( Brodsky and Schekman , 1993 ; Nelson et al . , 1993 ) . These data have led to a model where the as - sociation of Kar2p with the translocation machinery is de - pendent on its ADP - bound state . The hydrolysis of ATP by Kar2p may be stimulated by its interaction with the J domain of Sec63p . On the other hand , it may be that the interaction of Sec63p with Kar2p is simply to position BiP at the site of protein translocation , where it can interact with the na - scent chain . Brodsky and Schekman ( 1993 ) speculate that , in such a model , a second DnaJ - like activity might exist to stimulate the ATPase activity of BiP in the ER lumen . Our results suggest that Scjlp is the second DnaJ in the ER lumen that interacts with Kar2p . First , we show that there is a synthetic - lethal relationship between cells missing SCJ1 and kar2 - 159 mutants . Kar2 - 159 mutants are blocked in translocation of proteins across the ER membrane ( Vogel et al . , 1990 ) . On the other hand , cells missing SCJ1 and con - taining either of two other temperature - sensitive alleles of KAR2 , kar2 - 1 and kar2 - 133 , are viable . These alleles of KAR2 do not directly affect ER translocation ( Vogel , 1993 ) . These results suggest either a direct interaction between Kar2p and Scjlp or that they both participate in similar reac - tions , as suggested by Brodsky and Schekman ( 1993 ) . The second line of evidence that Scjlp can interact with Kar2p comes from results of the J swap experiment . We show that the Scjlp J domain can function in place of the J domain of Sec63p . Since this is the region of Sec63p that must interact with Kar2p , the results of the swap experiment indicate that the Scjlp J domain can do the same , that is , re - cruit Kar2p to the site of protein translocation . It remains a formal possibility that there is a second Kar2p - like Hsp70 in the ER lumen . Taken together , we propose a novel situation where two different DnaJs interact with the same Hsp70 through their respective J domains . One model for the role of Scjlp is an extension of that originally proposed by Brodsky and Schek - man ( 1993 ) . Sec63p would bind Kar2p ( BiP ) and place it at the site of translocation . As nascent proteins emerge from the translocation machinery , BiP is released , converted to its ATP form , and interacts with the emerging nascent chain . Scjlp would then catalyze repeated rounds of ATP hydrolysis that culminate in BiP being converted back to its ADP - bound form and reassociating with Sec63p . The viability of the SCJ1 null mutant could be due to the intrinsic ATPase activ - ity of Kar2p or a third lumenal DnaJ homologue . Recently , the mitochondrial Hsp70 has been shown to bind to Mim44p at the inner membrane . It is suggested that Mim44p may act like Sec63p to localize Hsp70 at the site of protein transloca - tion across the mitochondrial membrane ( Rassow et al . , 1994 ) . Information for the DnaJ - Hsp70 Interaction Is Conferred by A Small Number of Amino Acids As is the case for the Hsp70 protein family , there is also a family of DnaJ - related proteins in the eukaryotic cell ( for re - view see Kurihara and Silver , 1992 ) . By extension of the prokaryotic DnaK - DnaJ interaction , each DnaJ is predicted to have at least one Hsp70 partner . Since distinct Hsp70s are found in each intracellular compartment , it could have been the case that the interaction with a particular DnaJ would be conferred by colocalization . The other possibility is that it is the sequence of the J domain that confers specificity to the Hsp70 interaction . Since J domains have a high degree of similarity with each other , the question arises as to how much specificity could be achieved . Previous results have suggested that a particular Hsp70 in - teracts with a certain DnaJ . For example , a yeast cytosolic Hsp70 , Ssalp , cannot substitute for BiP in a reconstituted protein translocation system ( Brodsky et al . , 1993 ) . In addi - tion , Ydjlp stimulates the ATPase and peptide - binding ac - tivities of the cytosolic Ssa but not Ssb Hsp70s ( Cyr and Douglas , 1994 ) . We now present data that show that J do - mains from a mitochondrial and a cytoplasmic DnaJ cannot function in the ER lumen when placed into Sec63p . The re - sult that the Scjlp J domain will , on the other hand , function when inserted into Sec63p allows for the prediction of which amino acids may be important for the specificity of the inter - action between Sec63p / Scjlp and Kar2p . This turns out to be only three amino acids in the J domain . Conversion of one of these amino acids in the non functioning Sislp J domain rendered the fusion protein able to partially function , whereas two other mutations had no effect . However , all three mutations combined yielded a fully functional hybrid protein . Based on the structure of the E . coli DnaJ J domain ( Szpyerski et al . , 1994 ) , these three residues would lie on the outer face of two predicted tx helices . Perhaps this defines a surface through which the J domain directly interacts with a particular Hsp70 .
