Correlative light - electron microscopy ( CLEM ) is a pow - erful technique to do this , since we can combine the speci ﬁ city and dynamics of ﬂ uorescence light microscopy with the high resolution and cellular context of electron microscopy . A current challenge is to develop tools that allow us to track intracellular events using CLEM . Immunogold labeling has long been used for this purpose , however , pre - embedding immogold electron microscopy ( EM ) is invasive and its applications are limited 1 , 2 . More recently , attention has turned to genetically - encoded tags for CLEM . The ideal tag for CLEM should meet the following criteria : ( 1 ) ﬂ uorescent and electron dense so that it can be visualized by light and electron microscopy , ( 2 ) the electron density should be tightly focused and provide good signal - to - noise ratio so the tag is easily distinguishable from background by EM , ( 3 ) genetically encoded so that the cell can be processed in its native state without the need for permeabilization , and ( 4 ) non - toxic and non - disruptive so as not to interfere with normal cellular function . Existing tags do not meet all of these criteria . A popular approach has been to use diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) to form an electron - dense precipitate either by enzymatic - based poly - merization using peroxidase 3 , 4 or singlet oxygen - based poly - merization during photo - oxidation 5 , 6 . Although these tags allow CLEM , they result in low labeling resolution by EM due to the diffuse nature of the precipitate . Therefore , only proteins situated inside organelles , or those discretely localized at high densities can be successfully visualized 7 . The search for an ideal tag for CLEM has continued towards metal ligand - based tags combined with ﬂ uorescent proteins . Metal clusters contain elements that are able to scatter electrons and , if tightly focused , should improve resolution and be readily distinguishable from background . Two such tags are concatenated metallothionein 7 , 8 and bacterioferritin 9 , however each have sig - ni ﬁ cant drawbacks in their current form . Use of metallothioneins is limited to high abundance proteins and only minimal ultra - structural information is currently possible 7 . Tagging with bac - terioferritin is technically demanding , limited to bacteria , and can lead to aggregation and mislocalization of the target 9 . Human ferritin is a complex of 24 polypeptide subunits of light ( FTL ) and / or heavy ( FTH ) chains that form a spherical protein shell with internal and external diameters of approximately 7 nm and 12 nm , respectively . Under iron - rich conditions ferritin is able to store iron ( < 4300 Fe ( III ) atoms ) as a mineral core and is therefore easily visualized by EM 10 . The electron density of fer - ritin has been exploited for immunoEM for decades 11 , 12 and we hypothesized that it could be used as an ideal CLEM tag following some modi ﬁ cations . Here we introduce FerriTag , a new genetically - encoded indu - cible tag for CLEM . FerriTag is an engineered ferritin particle that can be acutely attached to a protein - of - interest using rapamycin - induced heterodimerization . We demonstrate how FerriTag can be used to tag single proteins at nanometer resolution . As exam - ples we label several proteins including huntingtin - interacting protein 1 related ( HIP1R ) which links clathrin - coated membranes to the actin cytoskeleton . We ﬁ nd evidence for different con - formational states of HIP1R which depend on its localization at clathrin - coated pits or uncoated parts of the plasma membrane . Results Design and implementation of FerriTagging . FerriTagging involves the creation of a ferritin particle ( FerriTag ) which can be inducibly attached to a protein - of - interest using the FKBP - rapamycin - FRB heterodimerization system ( Fig . 1a ) . To do this , FerriTag is co - expressed with the protein - of - interest which is fused to FKBP - GFP . FerriTag is untagged FTL and FRB - mCherry - FTH1 transfected at a ratio of 4 : 1 . When rapamycin is added , it induces the heterodimerization of FKBP and FRB domains resulting in the target protein becoming FerriTagged ( Fig . 1a ) . Our initial attempt to use Ferritin as a tag involved the direct fusion of FTH1 to a protein - of - interest , similar to a bacterial system described previously 9 . Mammalian cells expressing mCherry - FTH1 fused to the mitochondrial targeting sequence of Tom70p were cultured under iron - rich conditions and then visualized by ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( see Supplementary Note 1 ) . It was clear that this direct fusion resulted in aggregation and mislocalization of mitochondria , most likely due to the multivalent nature of the ferritin molecule . This observation drove us to engineer a novel ferritin tag that could form a ferritin particle independently and then be inducibly added to a protein - of - interest to avoid such aggregation issues . The dilution of FRB - mCherry - tagged FTH1 subunits with untagged FTL subunits is also an important step because aggregation was observed when FRB - mCherry - FTH1 was expressed alone . The outcome of this diluted - tagged version of ferritin , was no aggregation nor mislocalization before or after the addition of rapamycin ( see Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Our ﬁ rst target protein for FerriTagging was clathrin . HeLa cells expressing FerriTag and clathrin light chain a ( LCa ) tagged with GFP and FKBP were imaged by ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( Fig . 1b ) . These experiments show that , after the addition of rapamycin ( 200 nM ) , FerriTagging of clathrin - coated structures occurs within seconds ( Fig . 1c ) . The diffuse FerriTag signal can be seen to speci ﬁ cally decorate clathrin - coated structures throughout the entire cell , with full labeling after 30 s ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . We also tested if FerriTagging of clathrin inhibited its endocytic function . To do this , we measured transferrin uptake in cells where clathrin had been FerriTagged and compared them to control cells with no rapamycin treatment ( Fig . 1d , e ) . We found no difference in uptake of transferrin , suggesting that FerriTagging on a short ( 12 min ) timescale does not grossly interfere with clathrin function . Inhibition of CME could readily be detected by pre - treatment of the cells with hypertonic sucrose ( 0 . 45 M ) . With this approach working , we next wanted to observe FerriTagging by EM . Visualizing FerriTagged proteins by electron microscopy . In order to assess whether or not FerriTagging works at the EM level , we used correlative light - electron microscopy ( CLEM ) . Our EM protocol was optimized so that we could easily distinguish FerriTag from background and still be able to see cellular ultra - structure ( Fig . 2a ) . We initially FerriTagged two different proteins in disparate locations : 1 ) monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) , an outer mitochondrial membrane protein , and 2 ) clathrin light chain a ( LCa ) , part of the clathrin triskelion ( Fig . 2b ) . Following the addition of rapamycin , FerriTag was con ﬁ rmed by ﬂ uorescence microscopy to speci ﬁ cally label each protein - of - interest rapidly . After ﬁ xation and processing , ultrathin resin sections taken from the same cell were imaged by EM . In each case , electron - dense particles of approximately 7 nm diameter could be easily dis - tinguished from background , and the ultrastructure of the cell was visible . We were able to locate particles speci ﬁ cally in the vicinity of mitochondria ( in the case of MAO ) or clathrin - coated pits and vesicles ( in the case of LCa ) where each protein - of - interest is localized ( Fig . 2b ) . Since the FerriTagging CLEM protocol involves preincubating cells in iron - supplemented media and subsequent treatment with rapamycin , we explored if these steps perturbed normal cell biology ( Supplementary Note 2 ) .

Iron - loading and rapamycin treatment did not affect the localization of a range of cellular markers representing the actin cytoskeleton , lysosomes , mitochondria , caveolae , endoplasmic reticulum , clathrin coated structures , microtubules , intermediate ﬁ laments , nuclei , and adhesion complexes ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) .

A T2098L mutant of FerriTag can be used with the Rapalog AP21967 if prolonged FerriTagging is required and / or autophagy is a concern ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . In Ferritagging experiments , the particles observed by EM most likely correspond to FerriTag for four reasons . First , the size and shape of the particles was consistent with ferritin and labeling was observed in the expected places ( Fig . 3a ) . Second , no labeling was seen at clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) in cells when MAO was FerriTagged , and mitochondria were not tagged in cells when clathrin was FerriTagged ( Fig . 3b ) . Third , no particles were observed next to the appropriate organelle in cells where no rapamycin had been added ( Fig . 3c ) . Fourth , particles were less dense or were absent when FerriTagging was done in cells with no iron loading ( Fig . 3d ) . From these experiments we conclude that FerriTag works to speci ﬁ cally label proteins - of - interest at the ultrastructural level . Ef ﬁ ciency of FerriTagging by electron microscopy . What are the background concentrations of FerriTag and what densities are seen on the target organelle after FerriTagging ? To answer these questions , FerriTag particles in TEM images from cells expressing GFP - FKBP - LCa and FerriTag were counted by an experimenter blind to the conditions ( control vs . rapamycin - treated , see Image analysis in Methods ) . The location of these particles in cyto - plasmic or membrane - proximal regions was recorded and the particle densities in each region calculated . Coated areas of the membrane - proximal region could be distinguished and the den - sities in these areas were also determined . a b c Phase FerriTag Merge EM GFP L C a 2 2 3 1 2 1 M A O 1 2 3 4 3 4 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 Fix cells Seed cells onto gridded dishes Transfect FerriTag and protein - of - interest Iron - rich media P r ep 16 h Live - cell microscopy Rapamycin ( 200 nM ) L M Post - fix , stain 1 % OsO 4 Sectioning Processing TEM imaging of unstained sections 1 h E M 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 0 C y t o M e m C oa t C oa t M e m C y t o P a r t i c l e s ( μ m – 3 ) Fig . 2 Visualizing FerriTagged proteins by light and electron microscopy . a Overview of sample preparation steps for correlating light microscopy ( LM ) with electron microscopy ( EM ) using FerriTag . b Light and electron micrographs of HeLa cells co - expressing FerriTag with either FKBP - GFP - Myc - MAO ( MAO ) or GFP - FKBP - LCa ( LCa ) .

In the FerriTagged samples , the densities were 72 . 5 vs . 1308 . 6 particles per μ m 3 , a 18 - fold enrichment ( Fig . 2c ) . The density of particles in coated membrane - proximal zones in FerriTagged samples was signi ﬁ cantly higher than all other densities measured ( p < 0 . 0022 ) , all of which were similar to one another ( p > 0 . 29 , one - way ANOVA with Tukey ’ s post - hoc test ) . We used a stereological method to test if the relative labeling intensity ( RLI ) was different to the expected rate of regular points overlaid onto each image 13 . These points were tested for their coincidence with the cytoplasm or the coated membrane - proximal region . The summary counts and statistics from seven individual CLEM experiments are shown in Table 1 . The RLI in the coated membrane - proximal region for rapamycin - treated cells ranged from 2 . 6 to 4 . 3 times the expected values , indicating enrichment . The cytoplasmic RLI in rapamycin - treated samples was 0 . 2 to 0 . 6 of the expected , suggesting a depletion as particles relocated to membrane regions . For comparison , in controls the cytoplasmic RLI was 1 . 0 to 1 . 2 of the expected values . In FerriTagged samples , particles were found at higher than expected rates in membrane - proximal regions with no obvious clathrin coat . Given the speci ﬁ city of labeling , it is likely that these particles represent FerriTagged clathrin which is in the process of assembly / disassembly . This work indicates that any FerriTag associated with a particular subcellular structure represents real tagging , and that unbound FerriTag does not interfere with detection of genuine FerriTag labeling . Determining the labeling resolution of FerriTag . Labeling resolution refers to the accuracy with which the detected position of the particle corresponds to the location of the labeled protein 2 . The maximum possible distance that the FerriTag particle could be from the tagged protein is theoretically 22 nm ( Fig . 4a ) . However , FerriTag may adopt a more compact conformation or pose resulting in shorter observed lengths . To determine the labeling resolution directly , we FerriTagged the transmembrane protein CD8 α and processed samples for EM ( Fig . 4b ) . The perpendicular distance from the center of the FerriTag particle to plasma membrane was measured ( median = 9 . 5 nm , N = 458 particles , Fig . 4c ) . To interpret the shape of this distribution , we carried out computer simulations that modeled the detection of particles in EM sections ( see Supplementary Note 3 ) . These simulations indicate that FerriTag can exist in a number of length states from 7 to 18 nm . The distribution has a broad spread ( FWHM ≈ 10 nm ) , which means that on average the particle will be detected 10 ± 5 nm away from the target protein . This resolution exceeds that of traditional immunogold labeling which has a labeling resolution of 18 nm in pre - embedding or 21 nm on - section 2 . This dataset also allowed us to directly determine the signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) for FerriTagging ( 8 . 7 ± 0 . 1 , mean ± s . e . m . , Fig . 4d , see Supplementary Note 4 ) . The high SNR is encouraging for future computational approa - ches to automatically pick particles and quantify images from FerriTagged cells . Nanoscale mapping of HIP1R using FerriTagging . Having developed FerriTagging , we next wanted to carry out contextual nanoscale mapping of a protein - of - interest to answer a cell bio - logical question . Huntingtin - interacting protein 1 related ( HIP1R ) , the human homolog of yeast Sla2p , can bind mem - branes , clathrin light chain , and actin . It exists in two con - formations : extended and kinked ; and several models have been proposed to explain how HIP1R links the clathrin machinery to the actin cytoskeleton 14 – 19 . To test these models , we determined the nanoscale distribution of HIP1R at CCPs using FerriTagging . HeLa cells expressing HIP1R - GFP - FKBP and FerriTag were processed through our CLEM work ﬂ ow and TEM images of FerriTagged HIP1R on CCPs were acquired ( Fig . 5a ) . We col - lected images of CCPs and segmented the plasma membrane pro ﬁ le and position of FerriTag particles in each ( Fig . 5b , see Image analysis in Methods ) . Using spatial averaging , we plotted the distribution of all particles symmetrically about an idealized pit pro ﬁ le for visualization ( Fig . 5c ) . These data revealed that the distribution of HIP1R is homogenous over the entire crown of the CCP . Moreover , by de ﬁ ning the edges of the CCP we could map FerriTagged HIP1R distal to the CCP , i . e . , in adjacent areas of uncoated plasma membrane . Here , HIP1R was labeled at lower density relative to that at the CCP itself ( Fig . 5c , d ) . Interestingly , the distance from particles to the plasma membrane was greater for FerriTagged HIP1R at the pit vs . distal regions , a difference of 10 nm on average ( Fig . 5e ) . FerriTagging is at the C - terminus of HIP1R and any differences in distance to the membrane likely translate into changes in conformation of the molecule ( Fig . 5f ) . These data suggest that HIP1R is in an extended form at the CCP ; yet when distal to the pit , HIP1R is in a kinked conformation ( Fig . 5f ) . Discussion In this paper we described FerriTag , a genetically - encoded che - mically - inducible tag for CLEM that can be used to acutely label proteins in mammalian cells . The ﬂ uorescence and electron density of FerriTag allows proteins to be tracked by ﬂ uorescence microscopy in live cells and then visualized at the nanoscale by EM . FerriTag meets all four criteria for an ideal CLEM tag : ( 1 ) ﬂ uorescent and electron dense , ( 2 ) tightly focused electron den - sity , ( 3 ) genetically encoded , and ( 4 ) non - disruptive . Currently , the most widely used CLEM tags rely on the production of an electron dense cloud of precipitate that precludes precise Table 1 Observed distribution of particles in FerriTag experiments Condition Expt N image N FTo Cyto N FTo Mem N FTo Coat N FTo Total N FTe Cyto N FTe Mem N FTe Coat N FTe Total χ 2 p - value Control 1 26 26 1 0 27 23 . 7 1 . 1 2 . 2 27 0 . 716 0 . 398 Control 2 29 44 0 0 44 37 . 9 1 . 6 4 . 5 44 2 . 971 0 . 085 Control 3 6 18 0 0 18 17 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 5 18 0 . 438 0 . 508 Rapamycin 1 26 69 7 89 165 123 . 3 7 . 7 34 . 0 165 38 . 531 5 . 39 × 10 − 10 Rapamycin 2 16 15 15 36 66 50 . 9 3 . 7 11 . 5 66 29 . 301 6 . 20 × 10 − 8 Rapamycin 3 5 4 1 5 10 7 . 1 1 . 1 1 . 8 10 1 . 092 0 . 30 Rapamycin 4 8 7 8 31 46 38 . 1 0 . 6 7 . 3 46 33 . 196 8 . 33 × 10 − 9 The total number of FerriTag particles observed ( N FTo ) in either the cytoplasm ( Cyto ) , membrane ( Mem ) or coated membrane ( Coat ) regions of the indicated number of micrographs ( N image ) .

Due to the tightly focused electron density and good signal - to - noise ratio of ferritin , FerriTag can be used for nanoscale mapping of protein location . There have been previous attempts to use metal ligand - based tags to achieve this 7 – 9 , however there are signi ﬁ cant limitations to these methods which have prevented their wide application . The FerriTag protocol outlined here is simple and robust , with the potential to be used for any protein - of - interest which can be fused to FKBP . Ultrastructure is well preserved due to absence of detergent and it will also possible to incorporate high - pressure freezing into the protocol to better preserve ultrastructure 20 , something that is not currently possible with DAB - based genetically - encoded tags . Potential future innovations of Ferri - Tagging include : ( 1 ) alternative CLEM protocols that allow for ultra - precise correlated single spot ﬂ uorescence localization with FerriTag 21 – 23 , ( 2 ) improving staining to enhance the visualization of ultrastructure , ( 3 ) combining FerriTag with other tagging methods , perhaps with two - color EM 24 , allowing for multicolor EM , and ( 4 ) harnessing the magnetic properties of FerriTag for use as a puri ﬁ cation tag , or perhaps for direct magnetic manip - ulation of proteins in living cells . We think FerriTag may also be useful for cryoEM and cryoCLEM applications as the FerriTag particles are likely to provide signi ﬁ cant contrast in samples prepared in this way . FerriTagging has limitations . It is not possible to tag proteins which are located inside organelles , since FerriTag must be able to access the FKBP for FerriTagging to occur . However , successful tagging can be easily assessed by light microscopy , before any samples are processed for EM . Secondly , the iron - loading required for visualizing FerriTag may not be possible in iron - sensitive systems . In these cases it might be possible to enhance the basal iron bound by FerriTag , after ﬁ xation during processing . FerriTagging can be used to track events by light microscopy prior to visualization by EM , but there are two concerns here . First , does FerriTagging interfere with protein function ? We did not observe any adverse effects of FerriTagging on clathrin ’ s endocytic function , suggesting that CCSs could be tracked for long periods . Although any functional impact of FerriTagging of other target proteins would need to be assessed . Second , rapa - mycin has other effects which may affect live cell imaging . These effects occur on a much longer timescale ( tens - of - minutes to hours ) 25 . If imaging on this timescale is required , rapalogs may be used together with a mutated form of FerriTag ( see Supplemen - tary Note 2 ) . Our results showed that FerriTagging occurs within seconds . For most applications this timescale is suf ﬁ cient to track events and proceed to EM . The labeling resolution of FerriTag is 10 ± 5 nm , which exceeds the predicted resolution provided by standard immunogold labeling by either pre - embedding or on - section 2 . Furthermore , FerriTag exceeds the resolution of currently available super - resolution light microscopy methods , with the added bene ﬁ t that cellular context can be observed in relation to nanoscale locali - zation of the protein - of - interest 23 , 26 . Note that this comparison is not straightforward because super - resolution imaging of antibody labeling has a spatial resolution of > 15 nm , which is then slightly degraded because of what we term here as the labeling resolu - tion 27 ; EM has sub - nanometer spatial resolution . These proper - ties make FerriTag ideal for mapping protein distribution at the nanoscale . Contextual nanoscale mapping of proteins allows investigators to detail the ﬁ ne distribution of a protein - of - interest in the context of subcellular ultrastructure . In this paper , we used Fer - riTagging to do contextual nanoscale mapping of HIP1R in HeLa cells . At least three models have been proposed previously to explain how HIP1R distribution allows coupling of CCPs to the actin cytoskeleton 14 – 16 . First , immunogold labeling in unroofed cells suggested that HIP1R is restricted to the rim of CCPs 14 .

Note that this model precludes HIP1R in distal regions . Third , HIP1R was suggested to be throughout the pit and in distal regions . Away from the pit , HIP1R was thought to be in an extended strong actin - binding conformation , while in a closed weaker form at the pit itself 15 . In our study , we found that HIP1R is localized throughout the CCP and in surrounding areas of uncoated membrane , albeit at lower density . HIP1R at the pit appeared to be in an extended con - formation whereas in distal regions , the labeling was consistent with a shorter , perhaps kinked , conformation of HIP1R 14 . Our ﬁ nding of HIP1R throughout the pit is contrary to the ﬁ rst immunogold study , however the unroo ﬁ ng method used there may have removed HIP1R and actin over the crown of the pit , restricting labeling arti ﬁ cially to the rim 14 .

Model to explain our data : HIP1R is in an extended conformation when interacting with membrane , clathrin and actin , and is in a shorter / kinked conformation when not bound to clathrin ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 04993 - 0 8 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 2604 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 04993 - 0 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications noted HIP1R immunogold labeling in distal regions , associated with actin ﬁ laments 14 , which agrees with our ﬁ ndings . The localization we describe is closest to the third model 15 , while our conformation data more closely matches the second model 16 . We propose that the N - terminal ANTH domain of HIP1R associates with the plasma membrane and the C - terminal region THATCH domain binds actin 17 . If this is in a distal , uncoated section of plasma membrane the molecule is in a closed conformation . In the clathrin coat , interaction of the middle domain with clathrin encourages the extended conformation of the molecule allowing the coat to link to the actin cytoskeleton 28 . This arrangement allows the coat to be anchored against the cytoskeleton while polymerizing actin serves to push the vesicle away from the plasma membrane . De ﬁ nitive answers to the conformational state of any protein will require labeling at more than one place in the molecule which should be possible by moving the FKBP domain , provided the protein still localizes and functions normally . These are exciting times for exploration of the subcellular world and for investigations into protein function in cells at the nanoscale . We hope FerriTag will be widely adopted as a dis - covery tool on these expeditions . Methods Molecular biology . To make FRB - mCherry - FTH1 , human ferritin heavy poly - peptide 1 ( IMAGE clone : 3459353 ) was ampli ﬁ ed by PCR and inserted into pFRB - mCherry - C1 via Xho I - Eco RI . For expression of FTL only , human ferritin light polypeptide cDNA ( IMAGE clone : 2905327 ) was ampli ﬁ ed by PCR and inserted into pEGFP - C1 , removing EGFP , via Age I - Xho I . Plasmids to express FRB - mCherry - FTH1 and FTL are available from Addgene ( 100749 and 100750 , respectively ) . Rapalog - compatible FerriTag was made by site - directed mutagenesis to introduce the T2098L mutation into FRB of FRB - mCherry - FTH1 . FKBP - GFP - Myc - MAO was a kind gift from Sean Munro ( MRC - LMB , Cambridge ) 29 . GFP - FKBP - LCa was available from previous work 30 . To make CD8 - GFP - FKBP , CD8 α was ampli ﬁ ed by PCR and inserted into pEGFP - FKBP - N1 via Nhe I - Age I . To make HIP1R - GFP - FKBP , HIP1R ( Addgene plasmid 27700 ) was ampli ﬁ ed by PCR and inserted into pEGFP - FKBP - N1 via Xho I - Age I . Plasmids to express CD8 - GFP - FKBP or HIP1R - GFP - FKBP are available from Addgene ( 100751 and 100752 , respectively ) . To make pMito - mCherry - FTH1 , FTH1 was inserted into pMito - mCherry - FRB ( from earlier work 30 ) via Bsr G1 - Xba I . The following plasmids were from Allele Biotech : pmNeonGreen - Actin - C - 18 , pmNeonGreen - alpha - Actinin - 19 , pmNeonGreen - Caveolin - C - 10 , pmNeonGreen - Clathrin - 15 , pmNeonGreen - H2B - C - 10 , mNeonGreen - LC3B - 7 , pmNeonGreen - LAMP1 - 20 , pmNeonGreen - Tubulin - C - 35 , pmNeonGreen - Vimentin - 7 , pmNeonGreen - Zyxin - 6 ; whereas GFP - EB1 was available in the lab and pAc - GFP - Sec61beta ( Addgene plasmid 15108 ) . Cell biology . HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco ’ s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle Medium ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 100U / ml penicillin / streptomycin at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . Cells were transfected with a total of 1 . 5 μ g DNA ( for 3 . 5cm dishes ) using Genejuice ( Novagen ) following manufacturer ’ s instructions . The total amount of DNA for each plasmid transfected in FerriTag experiments , unless otherwise speci ﬁ ed , was 750 ng for GFP - FKBP tagged protein of interest , 600ng for FTL only vector and 150 ng for FRB - mCherry - FTH1 . Cells were imaged or ﬁ xed 2 day after transfection . Cells grown in iron - rich conditions were supplemented with FeSO 4 ·7H 2 O to a ﬁ nal concentration of 1 mM in growth media , 16h prior to imaging . As shown in Supplementary Fig . 2 , we determined that this concentration and duration of iron - loading was non - toxic to cells , since 3 . 3mM FeSO 4 for 72h was previously shown to alter the ultrastructure of HeLa cells 31 . For transferrin uptake analysis , HeLa cells were serum - starved for 20 min in serum - free DMEM and then exposed to 200 nM rapamycin or ethanol vehicle for 12min , with 0 . 05mg / ml Alexa 647 - conjugated transferrin ( Invitrogen ) added for the ﬁ nal 10min before ﬁ xing . As a negative control , 0 . 45M sucrose was applied 15 min at the serum starvation step to inhibit endocytosis . All dilutions were in serum - free media 32 . Light microscopy . Live cell imaging of FerriTagging kinetics was performed on a spinning disc confocal microscope ( Ultraview Vox , Perkin Elmer ) with a ×100 1 . 4 NA oil - immersion objective at 37°C . Cells were cultured in glass - bottom ﬂ uor - odishes ( WPI ) and kept in Leibovitz L - 15 CO 2 - independent medium supple - mented with 10 % FBS during imaging . Images were captured using an ORCA - R2 digital CCD camera ( Hamamatsu ) following excitation with 488 and 561 nm lasers . Fixed cell experiments were performed in transiently transfected cells attached to cover slips and ﬁ xed with 3 % paraformaldehyde , 4 % sucrose in PBS at 37°C . Cells were then washed in PBS before being mounted in Mowiol containing DAPI . Imaging was performed on a Nikon Ti epi ﬂ orescence microscope with standard ﬁ ltersets , equipped with a heated environmental chamber ( OKOlab ) and CoolSnap MYO camera ( Photometrics ) using NIS elements AR software . Where applicable , rapamycin ( Alfa Aesar ) was added by ﬂ owing in a concentrated solution in media at 37°C to a ﬁ nal concentration of 200 nM . Correlative light - electron microscopy . Following transfection , cells were plated onto gridded glass MatTek dishes ( P35G - 1 . 5 - 14 - CGRD , MatTek Corporation , Ashland , MA , USA ) . Light microscopy was performed as described above . Cells were kept at 37°C in Leibovitz L - 15 CO 2 - independent medium supplemented with 10 % FBS during imaging . Transiently expressing cells were located and the photo - etched grid coordinate containing the cell of interest was recorded using bright ﬁ eld illumination at ×20 for future reference . The same cell was then relocated and ﬂ uorescent live cell imaging was then acquired at ×100 . During imaging , rapamycin was added and once suf ﬁ cient labeling had been achieved , cells were immediately ﬁ xed in 3 % glutaraldehyde , 0 . 5 % paraformaldehyde in 0 . 05M phosphate buffer pH 7 . 4 for 1h . Following ﬁ xation , cells were washed several times in 0 . 05 M phosphate buffer , post - ﬁ xed in 1 % osmium tetroxide ( Agar ) for 1h , washed in distilled water and then dehydrated through an ascending series of ethanol prior to in ﬁ ltration with epoxy resin ( TAAB ) and polymerization at 60 °C . This gave suf ﬁ cient contrast without the need for post - staining . Coverslips attached to the polymerized resin block were removed by brie ﬂ y plunging into liquid nitrogen . The cell of interest was then located by correlating grid coordinates imprinted on the resin block with previously acquired bright ﬁ eld images . The resin around the cell of interest was then trimmed away using a glass knife . Serial , ultrathin sections of 70 nm were then taken using a diamond knife on an EM UC7 ( Leica Microsystems ) and collected on uncoated hexagonal 100 mesh grids ( EM resolutions ) . Electron micrographs were recorded using a JEOL 1400 TEM operating at 100kV using iTEM software . Image analysis . To measure FerriTagging kinetics in live cell imaging experiments , particle detection was carried out on binarized image stacks . Particles were used as a mask to collect mean pixel densities from both channels . The ratio of background - subtracted intensities was taken for each particle and the median value ( set to 0 ) used for averaging across multiple cells . As a control , the FerriTag channel was randomized and analyzed in the same way , giving no response . Transferrin uptake was analyzed from micrographs by applying a threshold and using Analyze Particles in FIJI 32 . To assess the particle densities , locations of particles in images were manually recorded by an analyst blind to the experimental conditions . In parallel , the images were segmented into extracellular , cytoplasmic , membrane - proximal regions ( 50nm zone on the intracellular side of the plasma or vesicular membrane ) . The membrane - proximal region was further subdivided into areas with a coat and areas where no coat could be detected . A custom - written procedure parsed the list of coordinates of particle locations , classi ﬁ ed them according to region and then calculated the volumes of each region in the images using section thickness as a scalar . In addition , according to the methods of Mayhew and Lucocq ( summarized in 13 ) , we tested if the relative labeling intensity ( RLI ) was different to the expected rate of the intersecting points of an 8×6 grid overlaid onto the image . The outer lines of the grid coincide with the image perimeter , so 6×4 = 24 points are tested for their coincidence with the cytoplasmic or the membrane - proximal region . These expected frequencies are scaled to the total number of observed particles for each experiment and tested using Pearson ’ s Chi - squared test with Yates ’ continuity correction . Manual detection and measurement of membrane proximity was also used for the CD8 - GFP - FKBP dataset . The computer simulations underlying the determination of “ labeling resolution ” are described in Supplementary Note 3 . The signal - to - noise calculations are described in Supplementary Note 4 . For mapping of HIP1R FerriTagging , electron micrographs in TIFF format were imported into IMOD and the plasma membrane and location of electron dense particles was manually segmented . The coordinates corresponding to contours and objects were fed into IgorPro 7 . 01 using the output from model2point . Custom - written procedures processed these data . First , the coordinates were scaled from pixels to real - world values , and the closest distance ( proximity ) to the plasma membrane was recorded . Next , the beginning and end of the pit were de ﬁ ned manually in a graphical user interface . The contour length of the pit was determined and the contour length between the start of the pit and the point of closest approach for each FerriTag particle was calculated . The ratio of these two lengths allowed us to plot out a spatially normalized view of the labeling locations . Particles that were closest to the membrane outside of the pit were plotted separately .
