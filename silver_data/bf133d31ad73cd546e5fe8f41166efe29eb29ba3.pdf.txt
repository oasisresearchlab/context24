Strange Places : Loci of Design Inspiration Abstract The inspiration for designing tangible , embedded , and embodied interaction can come from stranger places than needs assessments and observations . In conceptualizing home + , a pair of interactive furnishings enabling independent living , our design - research team found inspiration in modern painting and contemporary dance . Giorgio de Chirico’s painting “Furniture in the Valley” ( 1928 ) captures the curious vitality and intermingling of furniture outside their normal confines that our team translated into this active pair of home + robots and their intimate rapport . Two contemporary dance works , Andrea Miller’s “ ( C ) arbon” and Ohad Naharin’s “STOP , ” explore the interrelationships of three bodies , coping with their circumstances , which inspired the interoperability and control strategies across the pair of robots and a human “in - the - loop . ” This paper aims to inspire other design researchers to seek , in strange places , inspirations for tangible , embedded , and embodied interaction .

( The design of this system is very much ongoing . ) WIP Session 1 TEI ' 19 , March 17 – 20 , 2019 , Tempe , AZ , USA 173 Introduction Needs assessments , observations , interviews , usability studies , and other methods of participatory design have long served designers in the process of designing interactive artifacts that are elegant , desirable , and empathetic ( following partly the classical principles of good design— firmatis , utiilats , and vensustatis [ 27 ] ) . But all too often , these same methods become the under - examined means for validating design processes that fall flat . For designers ( broadly defined ) , there is , as Harrison , Back , and Tatar offer [ 12 ] , the unfortunate tendency of “dressing up design methods as more systematic and predictive than they are . ” Overwrought manifestations of such design activities include , in Kolko’s critique [ 16 ] , “two - hour ‘subject matter expert’ interviews , ” “’canvasses’ , ” “‘playbacks’ , ” “‘design sprints’ , ” and “lots and lots of Post - it notes . ” While this tendency can be attributed to those designers who blindly follow the script of “design thinking” [ 16 ] , it also is attributed to those “potential users”—the participants in design studies—“who don’t necessarily do or want things that make” [ 26 ] compelling interaction design . Recourses to this tendency comes in different forms , including : a deeper , more immersive engagement with user populations [ 16 ] ; grounding design in phenomenology [ 13 ] ( e . g . embodied interaction [ 9 ] ) ; and the use of mixed methodologies drawn from across disciplines as curated by this designer [ 1 , 12 ] . Partly in sympathy with the last form of recourse , this paper offers an alternative response that obliges designers to travel to strange places in search of strange things . A case study for this paper—our team’s design of a pair of interactive furnishings named home + enabling independent living ( as defined in [ 14 , 24 , 31 ] ) — elaborates our response ( adventure ? ) and serves as a means for its validation . Stopover - 1 : “Strange Things” that Change Maybe you can remember an instant in your life when some interior environment familiar to you ( your bedroom ? ) or welcoming to you ( a vacation retreat ? ) was momentarily transformed into the unexpected—a place alive to unforeseen prospects . Surely , you can remember an occasion from your childhood when the familiar contents of your bedroom changed their appearance , as they did to the delight of the Italian artist and writer Giorgio de Chirico a century ago . One such vision , captured in de Chirico’s painting , “Furniture in the Valley” ( 1928 ) [ 23 ] , profoundly influenced our design of a pair of furnishings as enabling technology . De Chirico’s painting ( figure 1 ) shows an upholstered chair , a headboard from a bed , an armoire or a chest , and what might be a fence from a garden— clearly , a physical environment far from home . As de Chirico writes in an essay , describing this enigmatic place : Perhaps you have occasionally noticed the singular aspect that beds , mirrored armoires , armchairs , divans , or tables have when you see them suddenly in the street , amidst a décor in which we are not accustomed to seeing them , such as happens during a move , or … before the doors of shopkeepers and second - hand dealers who display the principal pieces of their merchandise on the sidewalk . Then the furniture appears to us in a new light ; the pieces are dressed with a strange solitude ; a great intimacy is born between them , and one could say that a strange happiness floats in this narrow space that they occupy… [ 8 ] . Figure 3 : Early sketch of home + furnishings : h + lamp ( left ) and h + cube ( right ) . Figure 4 : h + cube ( prototype - 1 ) : exterior—panel removed . The red - colored body measures 46 . 65 cm ( 18 . 37 in ) along any length , and is encased in composite panels having a polyethylene core faced in aluminum . Each of h + cube ’s four legs is a linear actuator having a stroke length of 15 . 24 cm ( 6 in ) . We fabricated multiple components using a 3D printer and a CNC router working from our digital shop drawings . WIP Session 1 TEI ' 19 , March 17 – 20 , 2019 , Tempe , AZ , USA 174 Furnishings that are familiar to our living rooms but encountered in an unfamiliar context have , in de Chirico’s imagination , come to life—with “emotion , ” and an “intimacy formed between them . ” “Furniture in the Valley” is an invitation , as de Chirico offers , “to live in the world as in an immense museum of strange things…that change their appearance” [ 8 ] . De Chirico is not alone in an intellectual and artistic landscape of “lively” buildings , rooms , and furnishings ; but his painting and words show that there is perhaps more to the familiar places we live in than the static , fixed reality of them . De Chirico opens the doors , so to speak , to the concept of a living room of furnishings that have a strange vitality ; and we sought this prospect with the aid of computation and robotics . Designing the hardware of home + robots Giorgio de Chirico’s “Furniture in the Valley” ( 1928 ) captures the curious vitality and intermingling of furniture outside their normal confines that we translated into a pair of robotic furnishings . Inspired by de Chirico , we envisioned networked , cyber - physical home furnishings , each having different functionalities tuned for different purposes to support a common human need or to exploit an opportunity to improve the lives of co - inhabitant ( s ) . Our conception of home + is comprised , on the surface , of commonplace furnishings of an ordinary home – a lamp , a nightstand , an armoire , a wardrobe – that become “animated , ” working intimately , together and with their human “cohabitants , ” to perform routine , domestic , “CS - PFP 10” tasks [ 21 ] defining independent living . home + strives to empower people to remain in their homes for as long as possible , even as their physical capabilities alter over time , and , in more grave circumstances , to afford people some semblance of feeling ‘at home” as users move between their dwellings outfitted with home + and assisted - care facilities equipped the same way . Shaped by that “great intimacy” formed between de Chirico’s furnishings , and their capacity “to change their appearance , ” we then sought to validate this inspiration from places closer to our home in HCI , HRI , and interaction design . In this light , the transformation from familiar domestic furnishings to those of home + is achieved , borrowing the words of William Mitchell , by way of “geographically distributed assemblages of diverse , highly , specialized , intercommunicating artifacts” that render the physical environment a “robot for living in” [ 19 ] . In similar terms , former Wired editor Kevin Kelly imagines a future , artificial “ecology” of intelligent “rooms stuffed with co - evolutionary furniture” and a “mob of tiny smart objects , ” all having an “awareness of each other , of themselves , and of me” [ 15 ] . In this spirit , we situate home + opposite a robot servant such as PR2 [ 29 ] : the distributed cognition of home + versus a unified , humanoid intelligence . In recent years , we have developed a number of home + prototypes , including a robotic chair [ 7 ] , a robotic wall partition [ 7 ] , and robotic tables [ 7 , 24 ] . Our current and most advanced home + furnishings are a robotic pair : a mobile , robotic cube and a continuum - robotic lamp that we call h + cube and h + lamp ( figures 2 - 6 , 9 - 11 ) , h + cube and h + lamp are designed to work as complements within the volume of the typical room of the home or workplace : h + cube specifically engages in tasks within a spatial volume bounded by a room’s floor , upwards to approximately hip or table height , while h + lamp engages in tasks from hip or table height , upwards to near the ceiling of a typical room . Figure 5 : h + cube ( prototype - 1 ) : interior detail . Figure 6 : h + lamp ( prototype - 1 ) : interior view of the lamp’s base . WIP Session 1 TEI ' 19 , March 17 – 20 , 2019 , Tempe , AZ , USA 175 Practically , h + cube ( see figures 4 and 5 ) is a mobile robot that lifts objects from directly beneath it by way of linear actuators at each of its four legs working in concert with a jamming gripper , located at the core of the cubic volume and extending from a fifth , shorter linear actuator designed to rotate 90 degrees and 180 degrees . This ensemble is capable of transporting the retrieved object to a shelf , to a human co - habitant , or to the terminus of h + lamp . Tugged about the interior living or work space by h + cube and deposited by h + cube where needed , h + lamp ( see figures 6 and 9 ) has a mast comprised of a linear actuator closest to the floor extending continuously to a tendon - actuated , flexible continuum arm that is terminated by a jamming gripper and a bright light as means for illuminating task spaces . The mast ensemble can reach from below the top of the h + cube to the highest shelf in most homes or offices to transport objects across living and workspaces . h + cube can itself transport larger bins filled with objects ( e . g . laundry or groceries ) atop it . As just mentioned , h + cube and h + lamp work together with their human co - inhabitants to perform ten routine tasks enumerated in the “CS - PFP10” scale used by healthcare providers to define the capacity for independent living , as considered in [ 10 , 14 , 28 ] . Comprised of multiple , commonplace domestic artifacts , home + manifests something of the behavior of swarms , and also subscribes to the notion of the a - life community that , in living systems , the whole is more than the sum of its parts . The remarkable feature of the home + project is that , seemingly , the everyday furnishings found at home “come to life , ” forming a “living” room . To - date , we have performed user studies of the home + pair with 5 older adults and 12 medical staff as we continue iterating our design of this interactive , enabling system [ 25 ] . Stopover - 2 : Strange Dances We’ve arrived at two contemporary dance works : Andrea Miller’s “ ( C ) arbon” [ 18 ] and Ohad Naharin’s “STOP” [ 20 ] . In one of three rooms that serve as the stage for ( C ) arbon , two dancers—females—strong - willed yet clearly fatigued , are intent on transporting a third dancer—male—who is on the brink of collapse ( figure 7 ) . He unsteadily walks across a wall almost entirely by way of the strength remaining in his two partners . In an instance in STOP ( figure 8 ) , three dancers again—all female—move with and against each other . Figure 7 : Andrea Miller , ( C ) arbon [ 14 ] . WIP Session 1 TEI ' 19 , March 17 – 20 , 2019 , Tempe , AZ , USA 176 Designing the interoperability of home + When we see a humanoid robot , we expect of it behaviors akin to ours . But when we encounter robot furnishings like the home + pair of robots , we don’t really know what to expect from cyber - physical furniture . Where to find inspiration ? “ ( C ) arbon” and “STOP , ” two contemporary dance works exploring the interrelationships of three bodies coping with their circumstances , inspire the interoperability and control strategies across the pair of home + robots with a human “in - the - loop . ” The dancers of these works are not idealized , or dramatizing a tale , or moving gracefully ; they are , notably , striving or straining or seeking , or simply aiming to survive . In the strange beauty of the two dance trio’s movements can be found insights into “bodies in emotion” that can be translated to interaction patterns in the pair of robots ( figures 9 , 10 , 11 , and 12 ) . The motion planning of the robots is strangely beautiful—not quite machine or human . Figure 8 : Ohad Naharin . STOP [ 16 ] . Figure 9 : home + choreography : bending , reaching . Figure 10 . home + choreography : reaching , extending . WIP Session 1 TEI ' 19 , March 17 – 20 , 2019 , Tempe , AZ , USA 177 A Designer’s Ticket to Travel This paper presents a single case of discovering design inspiration in strange places , It is meant as provocation and plea . The productive value of discovering design inspiration in strange places has elsewhere been investigated [ 3 , 4 , 11 ] and rather robustly in a meta - analytical review of 43 design studies [ 22 ] which found that when designers identified a “single and uncommon source of inspiration ( like a de Chirico painting ) , the designers engaged in “a deeper search in a specific and remote domain , facilitating the generation of high - quality and novel ideas . ” A similar study [ 6 ] concurs with this finding , but with the caveat that “conceptually closer , rather than farther sources appear more beneficial . ” Is de Chirico’s furniture or the dance works of Miller and Naharin “too far” from the interactive system they inspired ? Should designers resist flying so far ? This paper takes the longer view , urging designers to travel far . As Brue Mau urges designers in his much - referenced “Incomplete Manifesto of Growth” [ 17 ] , “allow events to change you . [ … ] The prerequisites for growth : the openness to experience events , and the willingness to be changed by them . ” Designers of tangible , embedded , and embodied interaction should freely avail themselves to strange places and find inspirations there .
