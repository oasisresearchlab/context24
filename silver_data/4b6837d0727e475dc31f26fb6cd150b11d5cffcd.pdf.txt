These structures are built by the protein forms of so - called segment polarity ( SP ) genes . It is the asymmetric expression of SP genes which creates the fruit - ﬂy’s segmental structure . The SP genes and their products ( e . g . proteins ) can be said to form a system which is self - regulating , i . e . genes are used to make proteins and , in turn , proteins are used to turn genes on or o ﬀ . How this system achieves stable asymmetry of this kind is mathematically in - teresting as it can be thought of in a di ﬀ erent way - multiple symmetries in the same system . This is unusual and we attempt to explain how it is possible using a mathematical model constructed by von Dassow et al . When trying to understand a biological system of this kind , there are two main approaches - reductionist and holistic . We try to show that they are not mutually exclusive - we look at the whole system but reduce what is meant by the whole . For example , von Dassow’s model is large scale and , using it as a template , we show that a similar ( but smaller ) model inherits its properties . Smaller models can be made by short - handing the translation process ( through which RNA is used to make protein ) wherever an SP gene has a unique protein form . Our data indicates that the simultaneous wild - type expression of key SP genes ( engrailed and wingless ) takes places only when cumulative regulation of the wingless gene by two SP proteins is weak . The absence of this regulation would explain coexistence of multiple mathematical symmetries in one system ( represen - tative of genetic asymmetry ) as it acts like a division between them . In this way , the system itself can be thought to divide into two independent sub - systems which can be treated separately . 10 Declaration No portion of the work referred to in this thesis has been submitted in support of an application for another degree or qualiﬁcation of this or any other university or other institute of learning . 11 Copyright Statement i .

Previously , a fundamental belief of Science had been that one thing was at the heart of everything - Physics had its forces , Chemistry had its atom and Biology had its DNA . From the structure of these three , all the secrets of Nature and Matter would be revealed . But Science underestimated the full magniﬁcence of Life . For example , the physical and chemical structure of DNA alone cannot explain what makes us alive . In a similar way , the communication patterns of neurons in the brain ( using electrical signals ) cannot explain consciousness . These unexplained properties are said to emerge ( from the whole ) . This is where systems biology comes in - so much that is unknown is thought to be emergent and only by taking an holistic approach ( looking at entire systems ) can we further our understanding . Note 1 . 1 . 1 When local interaction of a system’s individual parts results in some global behaviour which is not an explicit part of the system’s design , this global behaviour is called emergent [ 66 ] . 15 What does an holistic approach mean ? It need not be as daunting as it sounds - when we talk about “the whole” , we do not start with the whole organism ( this is a longer term aim ) . What we do is shift the emphasis from , for example , an individual cell to a cell community ( a group of adjacent cells which work together to achieve common goals ) or from a single neuron to a network of neurons ( the connectivity of neurons is essential to their function [ 70 ] , e . g . controlling the body’s reaction to stimulus ) . This is the cornerstone of systems biology - there are hier - archies of matter and it is the way in which smaller parts of matter inter - connect which explains the functions of larger parts . Here , Mathematics comes in . The manner of inter - connection can be visualised as a network . What this does is show us the bigger picture , but what does that mean ? Suppose we know that A and B are related , but the bigger picture may be something previously unknown , e . g . that , by some long , complicated path , A and Z are related . What if this turned out to be the key to understanding how a system works ? Ultimately , this is the aim of all Science - to ﬁnd out how things work . Let us think of living things as complicated machines , built by someone we cannot consult . If we can determine both the parts list and how those parts ﬁt together , we may be able to work out how the machine works ( and even how to use it to best e ﬀ ect ) . Many of Life’s part lists have been compiled through reductionism , it is now for holism to correctly assemble those parts . This is the foremost aim of a network , identiﬁcation of a system’s wiring , what we sometimes call the system’s “architecture” . A network is an excellent ﬁrst step but it cannot show the extent of a system’s intra - play . To add detail to the qualitative information of a diagram , we employ so - called quantitative tools , i . e . mathematical models ( e . g . partial di ﬀ erential equations and Markov models - see “Models” section for more ) . The type of mathematical model used in this thesis is a set of di ﬀ erential equations whose 16 integration simulates , under di ﬀ erent conditions , a system’s progress and status as it changes over time . We can think of such models as the animation of a network . A model is built on existing knowledge , that is , it reﬂects empirical data . The hope then is that it can simulate scenarios which have not been tested empirically , thus generating predictions ( which can then be tested ) . In this way , a model tries to extend a ﬁeld’s knowledge . An alternative , but analogous , situation arises with a weather model - it is built on historical data and is used to predict future weather . The gift of all mathematicians is the ability to spot patterns . It could be a vi - sual pattern like symmetry or some kind of correlation , from which we may infer a connection between two entities . In Biology , this type of connection could identify which genes are associated , e . g . when the product of one gene ( its protein ) can help to turn on or turn o ﬀ another gene . Pathways of this kind may not be direct because gene regulation can be a mediated process , involving many di ﬀ erent genes . This is one of the reasons why the ability to spot patterns from data ( whether empirical or from models ) can contribute so much . 1 . 1 . 1 Biology - Transfer of information DNA RNA Protein transcription translation replication Figure 1 . 1 : General transfers of information which can take place in all cells [ 44 ] . DNA is the building blocks of Life . Sequences of DNA are called genes , which encode proteins i . e . a gene contains the pieces of information necessary to synthe - sise some protein . Some proteins are enzymes and these are vital to any organism’s optimal performance as chemical processes within , sped up by catalysts , must take 17 place at some minimal cost . In short , proteins inﬂuence a cell’s behaviour . In eu - karyotic cells , a copy of the organism’s DNA resides in each cell’s nucleus , where it remains throughout protein synthesis . When shortages of some protein occur , a copy ( called a messenger RNA , usually shortened to mRNA ) of its representa - tive gene is made ( in a process called transcription ) . Unlike DNA ( and genes ) , an mRNA can leave the nucleus for the cytoplasm , where bodies called ribosomes use them to make a protein ( in a process called translation ) . Note 1 . 1 . 2 This thesis uses models which characterise progression of the above process , i . e . the cell’s behaviour , by measuring concentrations of mRNA and protein in each cell and its local community ( of cells ) . If the correct proteins are not made available , a cell is unable to perform its intended purpose . Such models are often called regulatory networks as proteins regulate genes’ transcription . When a cell divides , so - called daughter cells are produced . These daughter cells perform the same function as the original ( parent ) cell and for this purpose , they need to carry the same chemical instructions . To this end , the parent cell’s DNA is copied ( in a process called replication ) . The double helix structure of DNA is unwound , with each of the helical chains separating [ 12 ] . Each strand is copied ( in a process catalysed by an enzyme called DNA polymerase ) and acts as a template . The result is two complete copies of the original DNA . But an organism requires more than the ability to reproduce in order to live . Perhaps the most essential ability of any living thing is metabolism ( turning food into energy ) which requires enzymes ( types of protein ) . For a long time , no one realised that proteins ( key to metabolism ) and DNA ( key to inheritance ) were , in any way , connected . The so - called Central Dogma ( CD ) of Biology ( proposed by Crick in 1958 [ 44 ] ) describes how the two keys of Life are related - through RNA ( which is almost chemically identical to DNA [ 12 ] ) . Note 1 . 1 . 3 In 1970 , Crick clariﬁed that there are three types of information transfer between DNA , RNA and proteins . These are called general ( which occur in all cells , see 18 Fig . 1 . 1 ) , special ( which occur in special circumstances such as when a cell is infected with a virus ) and unknown [ 44 ] . In the context of general transfers of information , RNA might be thought of as no more than an intermediary between DNA and protein . But more recently , scientists have found so - called microRNA ( a small non - coding species of RNA [ 59 ] ) which is thought to play a role in the transcription ( copying ) of some genes [ 59 ] . This role had previously been associated exclusively to proteins . Furthermore , what about the special transfers described by Crick ? Whilst the general transfers depict a one - way ﬂow of biological information , i . e . DNA - to - RNA - to - protein , ( retro ) viruses such as HIV introduce special cases . Once HIV invades a host , it can impose its own chemistry upon host cells . But the virus contains RNA rather than DNA , so how can it impose itself upon a host cell’s DNA ? Via a process called reverse - transcription . Note 1 . 1 . 4 Transcription makes an RNA copy of DNA whereas reverse - transcription makes a DNA copy of RNA . To make a DNA copy of its genetic material , a virus uses an enzyme called reverse - transcriptase . This viral DNA can then be spliced into the host’s own . It is this reverse - transcription which makes HIV so di ﬃ cult to treat . If the virus’ own genetic material becomes part of the host’s , the virus is then able to use the cell’s own machinery to copy itself . Whilst reverse - transcription is put to malevo - lent use by HIV , it can be used benevolently . Reverse - transcribing an organism’s mRNAs into DNA and comparing that DNA with the organism’s own DNA can show stark contrast . Note 1 . 1 . 5 When an organism is short of some protein , part of the DNA ( the gene which codes for the protein ) is copied in the form of RNA . However , sometimes that RNA captures more than just the gene , i . e . it copies more instructions than are necessary to make the protein . These unwanted instructions are simply removed in a process called splicing and what RNA is left ( the mRNA ) is used to make the protein . Thus , DNA resulting from 19 reverse - transcription of such mRNA would not be the same as the organism’s DNA . This can be very useful to scientists who want to identify which parts of the DNA code for some protein . The importance of RNA cannot be over - emphasised . Yes , proteins regulate tran - scription but now it is thought that so too does RNA ( in the form of microRNA ) [ 59 ] . Yes , DNA is the chemical template , but DNA can be made from RNA ( via reverse - transcription ) . DNA , RNA and protein must be thought of not as a chemical hierarchy , but as a chemical trinity of Life . 1 . 2 Models Input Processing Output Figure 1 . 2 : General structure of a model . In the pursuit of knowledge , the easiest second step ( following observation ) is to build a model of the object of interest . Scientists want to know how the object ( e . g a living thing , a mixture of particles , a machine , & c . ) behaves under di ﬀ erent conditions or in di ﬀ erent circumstances and sometimes they just want to know how it works , but why build a model ? When dealing with a biological object ( a living thing ) for instance , there is an ethical question ﬁrst and foremost . One cannot simply test living things without having some feel as to the outcome . To gain this feeling , we use models . A model can be thought of as taking some input , i . e . conditions in which the object may ﬁnd itself , deﬁned by the modeler . This input is then processed in some way ( representative of the object’s evolution under the set conditions ) to give some output . The foremost purpose of most models is to help the modeler work out which types of input correspond to which types of output . 20 Of course we know how input and output are related ( by the processing aspect of a model ) but this processing is not always easily understood , especially for complicated models . Models are “complicated” if the state ( behaviour or well - being ) of our object of interest depends on the interplay of its di ﬀ erent parts . For example , suppose we modeled the spread of some disease throughout a popu - lation . How infectious the disease were would be only one factor of the model - how integrated the population were would be of equal , if not greater , importance . Ultimately , the advantage of a model is that it can be frivolously tested at no expense . This allows theories to be put into practice without “harming” the object ( which could be a piece of expensive equipment di ﬃ cult to repair ) . Essentially , a model ensures that a scientist is well - prepared before they test ( and in doing so perhaps jeopardise ) the object itself . 1 . 2 . 1 Mathematical models There are two main types of mathematical model - deterministic and stochastic . A deterministic model is the more intuitive in that it will always give the same output for identical inputs ( e . g . [ 14 ] , [ 51 ] ) . This seems so obvious that it sounds like a strange thing to say , but it is not necessarily the case for stochastic models . Stochastic models have a “random element” to their processing which allows for two identical inputs to create di ﬀ erent outputs ( e . g . [ 9 ] , [ 23 ] ) . Note 1 . 2 . 1 It is the non - randomness of deterministic models which makes ( deterministic ) Chaos so interesting . A deterministic model ( if nonlinear with more than two degrees of freedom [ 58 ] ) is said to be chaotic if two very similar inputs ( of perhaps undetectable closeness ) give widely di ﬀ erent outputs ( or , to put it another way , if uncertainty about its present state grows rapidly [ 11 ] making its long - term future state unpredictable [ 58 ] ) . Why is this interesting ? Remember , the same inputs give exactly the same output every time in deterministic models , so we might expect similar inputs to give similar outputs , 21 yet they may not for chaotic systems . It is as though something “random” has occurred in a model with no capacity to be random ( i . e . a deterministic model ) . The name given to this phenomenon - Chaos - captures exactly the sense of panic felt by mathematicians as disorder invaded models which , to them , had always represented order . The truth of Chaos was more mundane - nothing random had taken place at all . Quite simply , some deterministic models were found to be highly sensitive to their input ( initial conditions ) . In consequence , a slight variation in input could quickly be turned into a hugely di ﬀ erent output . The implications of Chaos however were anything but mundane . Once mathematicians learned to embrace the idea of disorder , they began to realise its implications . If disorder could result from deterministic models , then they could use deter - ministic models to capture disorder . The implication was that even the most complicated systems seen in Nature - which had always seemed beyond simple mathematical description - were no longer out of reach . Stochastic models ( whose present state does not completely determine its future state [ 11 ] ) are often considered in some sense more realistic than their deterministic counterpart . Many physical ( and biological [ 6 ] , [ 54 ] ) systems have an element of so - called background noise ( something which has shown up in measurements of the system , which was not part of the system’s intended design ) and this can be simulated by the random element of a stochastic model . Note 1 . 2 . 2 Conversely , this noise can be introduced into a system artiﬁcially to the system’s beneﬁt . For example , the elderly are often more prone to falls through loss of balance . One of the causes of this is that the sensory threshold of neurons increases with age , thus impairing communication between the brain and the muscles . But scientists have devised special shoes with insoles that vibrate randomly . These random vibrations act as stimuli which lower the neuronal thresholds , thereby counteracting the damage done by the ageing process . This exempliﬁes a principle known as stochastic resonance [ 46 ] . 22 1 . 2 . 2 Dynamical Systems A dynamical system ( DS ) can be used as a mathematical model ( many mathemati - cians are interested in their behaviour generally , i . e . without having any physical system in mind ) . All dynamical systems can be thought to have three common features , the ﬁrst of which is some sense of Time . This usually takes one of two forms - a DS is usually either continuous or discrete . Discrete systems have this idea of evenly spread temporal “check points” ( e . g . every hour , every minute or every second , the system can be observed and its state measured ) . On the other hand , continuous systems , as the name suggests , have a continuous temporal ﬂow ( observation of this kind of system is not limited to ﬁxed check points in time ) . Aside 1 . 2 . 1 Behaviour of these two types of DS can be combined in so - called hybrid ( dynamical ) systems . In di ﬀ erent parts of a hybrid DS , both continuous - and discrete - time dynamics can be observed simultaneously [ 63 ] . Having established a sense of Time , a DS needs to know what to do as time passes . That is to say , as time passes , a DS needs ( mathematical ) rules to follow which tell it how to evolve . These rules use the previous state of the system to deﬁne the next state after that . Now we know how a system evolves , but how do we measure or observe its state at any given time ? With something called a state - space - a bounded geometrical region , inside of which we imagine a point . The position of this point , as measured by a vector , tells us the state of the system at any given stage . Famous examples of DS include the Lorenz system and the logistic map ( in both of which chaotic behaviour can be observed ) . 1 . 2 . 3 Networks & Motifs A network has two components - nodes and links . Nodes are linked together in a graph - like fashion depicting communication or interaction between them . Net - works are often used as a graphical representation of a dynamical system ( DS ) and the values of nodes alter according to the behaviour of the DS over time [ 52 ] . In 23 Y X Z Figure 1 . 3 : Feed - forward loop : X regulates Y whilst X and Y jointly regulate Z [ 50 ] . some networks , the same subgraph structures are found more frequently than one might expect ( from , say , an ensemble of random graphs [ 47 ] , [ 49 ] ) . Such surprisingly common subgraphs are called ( network ) motifs [ 47 ] and they are not exclusive to one type of network , i . e . the same motif could be found in a social as well as a genetic network ( genes and their products can be thought to function as networks [ 4 ] ) . And some networks ( e . g . genetic regulatory networks found in humans and fruit ﬂies ) might be thought of as an assembly of motifs [ 48 ] . In such cases , motifs play a signiﬁcant role in dictating behaviour of the whole sys - tem , motivating the study of individual motifs in isolation ( an individual motif’s function can be preserved though it is part of a network ) [ 48 ] . Note 1 . 2 . 3 Biology is full of hugely complex systems , e . g . regulatory systems , which are di ﬃ cult to model because of their vastness and level of detail . Hence the importance of motifs , as these big systems can be studied in terms of building blocks ( motifs being viewed as fundamental building blocks of the system ) [ 50 ] . Conversely , understanding building blocks by considering motifs separately can aid the design of systems from an engineering perspective [ 48 ] . An example of a common network motif is a three - node feed - forward loop ( found in numbers more than ten standard deviations greater than their random graph 24 mean [ 49 ] ) such as are found in regulatory networks ( where a regulator both acti - vates the gene directly and activates the gene’s repressor ) [ 48 ] . This kind of motif ( see Fig . 1 . 3 ) is found throughout the regulatory network of Escherichia coli which controls gene expression [ 50 ] . The frequency with which these recurring structures are seen suggests that these motifs may have speciﬁc functions [ 50 ] of such impor - tance as to ensure their prominence within a network [ 52 ] . In this way , the function of a motif may be intrinsically connected to its structure ( although this is generally not presumed and indeed motifs of identical structure may give rise to distinct behaviour [ 52 ] ) . Conversely , if the biological function of a motif is known , its shape within a network representation could be deduced . Furthermore , Prill et al . propose that system - level properties such as robustness are linked to the presence of certain motifs [ 52 ] . Prill et al . report that the stability of a motif decreases as the number ( or length ) of loops increases and that the more stable motifs are more prominent in the regulatory networks of fruit ﬂies and E . coli [ 52 ] . They propose that this may result from evolutionary pressure choosing the most robust structures . 1 . 3 Development of fruit ﬂy A fruit ﬂy’s segment formation results from a sequence of cascading genetic ex - pression [ 8 ] , [ 7 ] . Maternal e ﬀ ect genes bicoid and nanos are respectively transcribed at the anterior and posterior end of a fruit ﬂy egg during its formation . Expression of further segmentation genes succeeds the maternal e ﬀ ect genes , establishing ﬁner patterns [ 8 ] . The ﬁrst such class of segmentation genes ( of which there are around forty in all [ 21 ] ) are called gap genes [ 1 ] . Bicoid and nanos proteins regulate the gap genes . Activation of the gap genes , notably Kruppel , deﬁnes large areas perpendicular to the anterior - posterior axis of the embryo . Transcription factors encoded by gap genes regulate the second 25 class of segmentation genes , the pair - rule genes . Notably including even - skipped and fushi tarazu , the pair - rule genes establish narrow stripes of expression . Many pair - rule genes encode transcription factors which regulate the ﬁnal class of seg - mentation genes - the segment polarity ( SP ) genes . Expression of SP genes is maintained through a network of regulatory interac - tion [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] and is life - long [ 8 ] . Segment polarity genes ( speciﬁcally engrailed and wingless [ 21 ] ) deﬁne boundaries between so - called parasegments , with a single - cell wide wingless stripe in the most posterior part and a single - cell wide engrailed ( and hedgehog ) stripe in the most anterior part [ 8 ] , [ 21 ] . Expression of these key SP genes engrailed ( en ) and wingless ( wg ) is interdependent [ 8 ] . Before cell prolifera - tion , parasegments are four cells wide and wild - type expression patterns ( e . g . the single - cell wide stripes of en and wg ) are repeated every four cells [ 57 ] . 1 . 4 Conclusion In this chapter , we sought to introduce our reader to the themes of systems biology as an area and the part that mathematicians can play . Most of these themes will be seen again in this work . The following thesis is a tool - building exercise for the analysis of large ( biological ) systems . Devised methods are applied to a fruit ﬂy model ( speciﬁcally , a genetic circuit responsible for part of its development ) proposed by von Dassow et al . and we make some discoveries . 1 . 4 . 1 Our next chapter Let us now introduce our reader to this fruit ﬂy model and its features of interest . 26 Chapter 2 von Dassow’s SPN 2 . 1 Introduction The segment polarity network ( SPN ) is partly responsible for the formation of body segments in a fruit ﬂy’s early development . Success of this function coincides with speciﬁc patterns of gene expression ( in this thesis , we shall say that a gene is expressed if an RNA copy is made , although this is an idiosyncratic usage : such a gene has been transcribed , but is not usually thought to be expressed until after translation into protein ) and this is the means by which we identify a well - functioning SPN . Note 2 . 1 . 1 A mathematical model of the SPN was suggested by von Dassow et al . in [ 1 ] with more detail given in [ 2 ] . In multi - cellular organisms , individual cells function as part of a network , i . e . they communicate with , and respond to , other cells . Similarly , gene products ( e . g . mRNAs and proteins ) respond to each other , i . e . the production of each depends on that of some other ( s ) . The interaction of the products of ﬁve segment polarity ( SP ) genes is believed su ﬃ cient to achieve the SPN’s goal [ 1 ] . Particularly iconic amongst these genes are the wingless ( wg ) , engrailed ( en ) and hedgehog ( hh ) genes as a stripe of wg - expressing cells is found anterior , whilst a stripe of en / hh - expressing cells is found posterior , of the parasegmental boundary . 27 Note 2 . 1 . 2 The resulting pattern of expression is sometimes referred to as the SPN’s “characteristic asymmetry” [ 1 ] ( see Fig . 2 . 1 ) . It is these genes , then , which deﬁne the boundaries between parasegments and it is the function of the SPN to maintain these boundaries [ 4 ] . In [ 1 ] , von Dassow et al . report their model able to capture wild - type expression of these three iconic genes robustly , i . e . under variation in both initial conditions ( ICs ) and parameters . Can we emulate these ﬁndings ? Their model can be thought of in two forms ; network form and equation form , the former we present ﬁrst . The latter , we write in a Matlab program and test ourselves , ﬁnding one set of conditions ( which we call set 69 ) that replicates characteristic asymmetry . wg wg wg enhh enhh enhh wg wg wg wg wg enhh enhh enhh enhh enhh wg wg wg wg enhh enhh enhh enhh Figure 2 . 1 : Characteristic asymmetry of the SPN : Key SP gene wg is expressed in the second cell , whilst key SP genes en and hh are expressed in the third cell , of each four - cell segment ( see Fig . 2 . 4 ) . Every column of en / hh expressing cells is ﬂanked by three columns of non - en / hh expressing cells , to both its anterior and posterior . In this sense , wild - type expression of en and hh is symmetrical about the third cell of each four - cell segment . In a similar sense , wild - type expression of wg is symmetrical about the second cell of each four - cell segment . But wild - type expression of key SP genes ( wg , en and hh ) collectively is not symmetrical about any cell and is thus referred to as the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry . 2 . 2 Networks A network is formed of a set of vertices ( or “nodes” ) connected by a set of edges ( or “links” ) . In a regulatory network , such as the SPN , nodes represent products 28 of genes , whilst edges represent their interactions , with the kind of ( directed ) edge depending on whether the interaction is excitatory or inhibitory . Note 2 . 2 . 1 Nodes of the network represent the time - dependent variables of the SPN model proposed by von Dassow et al . [ 2 ] . Each time - dependent variable alters according to a mathematical rule described by an ordinary di ﬀ erential equation ( usually shortened to ODE ) . Any variable of which this rule is a function is said to be “coupled” to the variable whose time - dependent behaviour is described by the rule . When translating the network into a system of ODEs , each vertex is represented by a time - dependent variable and each edge by a coupling between those variables . 2 . 2 . 1 von Dassow’s network The network proposed by von Dassow et al . ( see Fig . 2 . 2 ) represents segment polarity ( SP ) gene products by vertices and their interdependence by directed edges ( where direction means “inﬂuences production of” ) between vertices . In Figure 2 . 2 , arrow - headed edges represent a positive inﬂuence and round - headed edges represent a negative inﬂuence . Note 2 . 2 . 2 Let us be clear - when two nodes are connected in a graph , this means that the behaviour of one may a ﬀ ect that of the other , but this is not a deﬁnitive action . That is , the edges of the network in Figure 2 . 2 ) are only potentially there - they can be thought of as being on ( in which case the edge is there and the action takes place ) or o ﬀ ( in which case the edge is not there and the action does not take place ) . Nodes are di ﬀ erently shaped depending on what type of SP gene product they rep - resent . For mRNAs , round nodes are used and for proteins square nodes . Proteins sometimes bind to form so - called protein complexes and this is the case here ( rep - resented by a hexagonal node ) . Finally , a basal transcription factor ( represented by a rhombus ) is a protein which provides a generic source of induction ( we say that a gene is induced when its expression is aided by a protein ) . 29 Note 2 . 2 . 3 Proteins ( and their complexes ) which reside in the cell membrane shall be referred to as extracellular , whilst all other proteins and mRNAs are intracellular ( residing in the nucleus and / or cytoplasm ) . Each hexagonal cell contains twenty four extracellular and ten intracellular nodes . Figure 2 . 2 shows communication between neighbouring cells ( nodes situated on the cell face are membranous ) . For clarity , we show only one of the six cell faces belonging to each of these neighbouring cells . Each cell face contains the same four nodes , which interact in an identical way with nodes of their own nucleus and those of the apposing cell face . Note 2 . 2 . 4 To an earlier version of their SPN model ( which was unable to capture the characteristic asymmetry of the SPN , i . e . wild - type expression of key SP genes en , wg and hh ) , von Dassow et al . added both the arrow from IWG to wg and the arrow from CN to en seen in Figure 2 . 2 . These additional links were enough to produce a model that could capture characteristic asymmetry robustly [ 1 ] . Node What does it represent ?

( which we may refer to as “von Dassow’s SPN” ) . 2 . 2 . 2 The segment polarity network Each cell in the model is thought a two - dimensional , regular hexagon with seven compartments , six of which represent the cell membrane ( one sixth for each side of the cell ) and one of which is the cytoplasm and nucleus ( see Fig . 2 . 4 ) . Von Dassow et al . model a four - cell - wide , one cell - high strip ( called a segment ) and consider the SPN as a tiling thereof ( see Fig . 2 . 4 ) . Aside 2 . 2 . 1 If we imagine a grid of cells , horizontal boundaries identify with each other , as do vertical boundaries . Thus , the grid of cells has the topology of a torus and hence , no boundary e ﬀ ects [ 4 ] . The SPN is characterised by the expression of certain genes about the middle of each segment - these genetic boundaries deﬁne the so - called parasegments . Wild - type wingless ( wg ) is expressed immediately anterior , whilst engrailed ( en ) and hedgehog ( hh ) genes are expressed immediately posterior , of the parasegmental boundary ( e . g . see Fig . 2 . 3 ) . Thus , throughout this piece , we may refer to the second and third cells of said segments as the wg domain ( of expression ) and en / hh domain ( of expression ) respectively . 31 en EN wg IWG EWG ptc PTC ci CI CN hh HH PH cell 1 cell 2 cell 3 cell 4 SPN segment en , EN , hh , HH en , EN , hh , HH en , EN , hh , HH en , EN , hh , HH ptc , PTC , ci , CI , CN , PH ptc , PTC , ci , CI , CN , PH ptc , PTC , ci , CI , CN , PH ptc , PTC , ci , CI , CN , PH ptc , PTC , ci , CI , CN ptc , PTC , ci , CI , CN ptc , PTC , ci , CI , CN ptc , PTC , ci , CI , CN wg , IWG , ptc , PTC , ci , CI , CN , PH wg , IWG , ptc , PTC , ci , CI , CN , PH wg , IWG , ptc , PTC , ci , CI , CN , PH wg , IWG , ptc , PTC , ci , CI , CN , PH SPN segment Figure 2 . 3 : Alternative representations of a four - cell segment under the conditions described by set 69 ( a parameter set under which correct patterning is seen in von Dassow’s SPN ) .

To what precise level we measure using the associated set of ordinary di ﬀ erential equations ( ODEs ) . An ODE is a di ﬀ erential equation in which derivatives are taken with respect to only one independent variable ( in this case , that variable is time ) . As such , the set of ODEs associated to von Dassow’s SPN ( see Fig . 2 . 2 ) describes its evolution over time . By integrating this set of ODEs , we undo the di ﬀ erentiation ( with respect to time ) of the SP gene products seen in von Dassow’s SPN . Doing this continually with Matlab simulates the interactions described by the directed edges of Figure 2 . 2 and the concentrations of SP gene products which result from their interaction . The degree of this interaction is largely represented by parameters ( which are not time - dependent ) in the ODEs . Before we relay these ODEs , we introduce these parameters , together with their biological meaning and the range over which their values are chosen . 33 2 . 3 . 1 Inputs : Parameters Interaction of the nodes of von Dassow’s SPN ( see Fig . 2 . 2 ) is intrinsic in its nature , but the degree to which it exists varies in accordance with pre - selected inputs , collectively termed parameter sets . A parameter is a ﬁxed numerical input , of which the model is a function . Its meaning is deﬁned by its e ﬀ ect upon the model - usually the rate at which a process happens , e . g . translation of a protein . Aside 2 . 3 . 1 The ODEs associated to von Dassow’s SPN contain forty eight parameters ( as shown in the table which immediately follows ) , the values of which were randomly sampled over biologically realistic ranges on logarithmic scales ( with the exceptions of cooperativity coe ﬃ cients and half - lives , which were sampled on a linear scale ) [ 76 ] , [ 77 ] . Two additional parameters in the associated ODEs - T 0 and ν Bci - are ﬁxed . Von Dassow et al . wanted their SPN to be non - dimensionless : a change of variable t = T 0 τ was used , where t is time , T 0 is a characteristic time constant ( equal to one minute ) and τ is a dimensionless variable . Representing the cooperativity of B’s induction of ci , ν Bci is ﬁxed at one which , as B is an ever - preset protein ( represented by a dummy node ) . 34 Parameter Range Meaning Set 69 value κ WGen 10 − 3 − 1 how potently EWG induces en transcription 0 . 1020 κ CNen 10 − 3 − 1 how potently CN inhibits en transcription 0 . 3003 κ WGwg 10 − 3 − 1 how potently IWG induces wg transcription 0 . 0624 κ CIwg 10 − 3 − 1 how potently CI induces wg transcription 0 . 5187 κ CNwg 10 − 3 − 1 how potently CN inhibits wg transcription 0 . 0553 κ CIptc 10 − 3 − 1 how potently CI induces ptc transcription 0 . 0324 κ CNptc 10 − 3 − 1 how potently CN inhibits ptc transcription 0 . 9693 κ Bci 10 − 3 − 1 how potently B induces ci transcription 0 . 0033 κ ENci 10 − 3 − 1 how potently EN inhibits ci transcription 0 . 0185 κ PTCCI 10 − 3 − 1 how potently PTC cleaves CI 0 . 0077 κ ENhh 10 − 3 − 1 how potently EN induces hh transcription 0 . 0374 κ CNhh 10 − 3 − 1 how potently CN inhibits hh transcription 0 . 0061 ν WGen 1 − 10 cooperativity of EWG’s induction of en 9 . 2426 ν CNen 1 − 10 cooperativity of CN’s inhibition of en 5 . 0552 ν WGwg 1 − 10 cooperativity of IWG’s induction of wg 4 . 2797 ν CIwg 1 − 10 cooperativity of CI’s induction of wg 2 . 6535 ν CNwg 1 − 10 cooperativity of CN’s inhibition of wg 8 . 8335 ν CIptc 1 − 10 cooperativity of CI’s induction of ptc 5 . 4983 ν CNptc 1 − 10 cooperativity of CN’s inhibition of ptc 4 . 4979 ν ENci 1 − 10 cooperativity of EN’s induction of ci 8 . 2026 ν PTCCI 1 − 10 cooperativity of PTC’s cleavage of CI 8 . 5149 ν ENhh 1 − 10 cooperativity of EN’s induction of hh 3 . 2278 ν CNhh 1 − 10 cooperativity of CN’s inhibition of hh 9 . 5367 H en 5 − 100 half life of en 8 . 1996 H EN 5 − 100 half life of EN 11 . 7149 H wg 5 − 100 half life of wg 19 . 8829 H IWG 5 − 100 half life of IWG 10 . 5053 H EWG 5 − 100 half life of EWG 67 . 1075 35 Parameter Range Meaning Set 69 value H ptc 5 − 100 half life of ptc 63 . 4793 H PTC 5 − 100 half life of PTC 11 . 1464 H ci 5 − 100 half life of ci 18 . 3447 H CI 5 − 100 half life of CI 53 . 2125 H CN 5 − 100 half life of CN 75 . 5928 H hh 5 − 100 half life of hh 16 . 9110 H HH 5 − 100 half life of HH 9 . 4145 H PH 5 − 100 half life of PH 34 . 6856 r EndoWG 10 − 3 − 1 rate of EWG endocytosis 0 . 6336 r ExoWG 10 − 3 − 1 rate of IWG exocytosis 0 . 0025 r MxferWG 10 − 3 − 1 rate of EWG cell - to - cell exchange 0 . 0269 r LMxferWG 10 − 3 − 1 rate of EWG intramembrane di ﬀ usion 0 . 3580 r LMxferPTC 10 − 3 − 1 rate of PTC intramembrane di ﬀ usion 0 . 0551 r LMxferHH 10 − 3 − 1 rate of HH intramembrane di ﬀ usion 0 . 0013 α CIwg 1 − 10 saturability coe ﬃ cient of CI’s wg induction 1 . 0540 α WGwg 1 − 10 saturability coe ﬃ cient of IWG’s wg induction 8 . 3598 [ PTC ] 0 10 3 − 10 6 maximal cellular concentration of PTC 3 . 7892 × 10 3 [ HH ] 0 10 3 − 10 6 maximal cellular concentration of HH 9 . 3812 × 10 5 k PTCHH 10 − 5 − 10 − 3 second order rate constant 6 . 1559 × 10 − 4 C CI 10 − 3 − 1 rate at which PTC cleaves CI 0 . 1771 Note 2 . 3 . 1 The ranges of half - lives are all in minutes here . Note that these are not half - lives in the true sense , as they do not represent the time required for the quantity of material to fall by a factor of two . Nevertheless , as this is the term used by von Dassow et al . in [ 2 ] and [ 4 ] , we use it in this piece too . Parameters whose ranges cover several orders of magnitude were sampled uniformly over a log scale ( to avoid any bias toward the upper end of their range ) . Von Dassow et al . use sub - ranges of realistic general ranges , whose upper and / or lower bound is excluded because those parts are not relevant in the context of their model , e . g . since patterns of SP gene expression change on a time scale of thirty 36 minutes , values higher than one hundred minutes could prevent their model changing on a realistic time scale [ 2 ] . May our reader note the ﬁnal column of the table which gives an example of a randomly chosen parameter set of particular interest to us and shall be addressed in due course . 2 . 3 . 2 Inputs : Initial conditions 1 Y EWG Y EWGY Y x Y Y 1 , 1 1 , 2 1 , 3 1 , 4 1 , 6 1 , 5 Cell 1 2 Y EWG Y Y Y x Y Y 2 , 1 2 , 2 2 , 3 2 , 4 2 , 6 2 , 5 Cell 2 3 Y EWG Y EWGY Y x Y Y 3 , 1 3 , 2 3 , 3 3 , 4 3 , 6 3 , 5 Cell 3 4 Y EWG Y Y Y x Y Y 4 , 1 4 , 2 4 , 3 4 , 4 4 , 6 4 , 5 Cell 4 Figure 2 . 5 : Labeling of intracellular and extracellular nodes in four - cell segment . There are three classes of so - called segmentation genes which establish the segmented body of a fruit ﬂy . The ﬁrst class are called gap genes , the second class pair - rule genes and the third class segment polarity ( SP ) genes . These form the ﬁrst , second and third layers respectively of a cascade of segmentation genes . Von Dassow et al . model this third layer in their SPN model , where the SP genes are imprinted by pair - rule gene products [ 1 ] . The model’s ICs set the concentrations of mRNA , protein and protein - complex at the outset of this particular stage in the fruit ﬂy’s development . Concentrations of each SP gene product are given as a dimensionless concentration . Note 2 . 3 . 2 Von Dassow’s SPN was originally a dimensional model . As part of its non - dimensionalisation , they used the change of variable , x i , j ( τ ) = [ x ] i , j [ x ] 0 where [ x ] i , j is the 37 dimensional concentration of x i , j , [ x ] 0 its maximal steady state concentration and x i , j ( τ ) the dimensionless concentration of x i , j [ 2 ] . Why is the model’s choice of ICs important ? An otherwise identical model could evolve di ﬀ erently under di ﬀ ering ICs . Note 2 . 3 . 3 Let us think of some intracellular node x in von Dassow’s SPN ( see Fig . 2 . 2 ) . Each cell of the four - cell segment ( see Fig . 2 . 4 ) contains its own “copy” of x , thus there are four unique copies of x , which need to be distinguished . We do so using a subscript notation i . e . x i , where i ∈ [ 1 , 4 ] denotes the cell number . For example , wg 3 represents concentrations of wg in the third cell of the segment . Similarly , if Y is some extracellular node , then each cell - face contains its own copy of Y and there are six such unique copies per cell . We use Y i , j , where i retains its previous meaning and j ∈ [ 1 , 6 ] indicates cell - face ( see Fig . 2 . 5 ) , e . g . EWG 4 , 5 would represent concentrations of EWG on the ﬁfth face of the fourth cell in the segment . The following table shows the ICs we use throughout this piece ( what von Dassow et al . referred to as “Close to target pattern” ICs [ 1 ] ) . In the right hand column of the table , we make use of the notation , x = ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 ) . Levels of expression are taken to be low ( less than 20 % of possible ) , moderate ( 20 % − 60 % of possible ) or high ( 60 % − 100 % of possible ) [ 1 ] . Values of a node are given as a percentage of its maximal steady state [ 80 ] . 38 Node Initial conditions en en = ( 0 . 001 , 0 . 001 , 1 , 0 . 001 ) EN EN = ( 0 . 001 , 0 . 001 , 1 , 0 . 001 ) wg wg = ( 0 . 001 , 1 , 0 . 001 , 0 . 001 ) IWG IWG = ( 0 . 001 , 1 , 0 . 001 , 0 . 001 ) EWG all EWG i , j = 0 . 001 ptc ptc = ( 0 . 1 , 0 . 6 , 0 . 001 , 0 . 6 ) PTC PTC i , j = 0 . 02 when i = 1 and 0 . 001 otherwise ci ci = ( 0 . 6 , 0 . 6 , 0 . 001 , 0 . 6 ) CI CI = ( 0 . 1 , 0 . 6 , 0 . 001 , 0 . 6 ) CN CN = ( 0 . 6 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 001 , 0 . 1 ) hh hh = ( 0 . 001 , 0 . 001 , 1 , 0 . 001 ) HH HH i , j = 0 . 16 when i = 3 and 0 . 001 otherwise PH all PH i , j = 0 . 001 B B = ( 0 . 4 , 0 . 4 , 0 . 4 , 0 . 4 ) Is this choice in ICs realistic ? Yes - SP genes are stably expressed throughout a fruit ﬂy’s development from the point at which they are ﬁrst expressed [ 3 ] . We do not really test ICs here then , but conditions ( set by parameters ) - asking whether they allow a fruit ﬂy to stably maintain the parasegmental boundaries ( deﬁned by SP gene products ) from this stage onwards . Having introduced all inputs to von Dassow’s ODE system , we can introduce the system itself ( lifted from [ 2 ] with a couple of corrections veriﬁed by and , with thanks to , George von Dassow [ 80 ] ) . Aside 2 . 3 . 2 Von Dassow’s ODEs [ 2 ] contained two typing errors , both of which involved decay rates of proteins . Under these erroneous ODEs , extracellular wingless protein , EWG , shared the half - life of its intracellular counterpart , IWG . Similarly , the repressor form of cubitus interruptus protein , CN , was given the same half - life as its non - repressor form , CI . In fact , each protein has its own half - life , i . e . EWG and CN have half - lives H EWG and H CN respectively . 39 2 . 4 Processing : ODE system Let us introduce the ODEs associated to von Dassow’s SPN ( see Fig . 2 . 2 ) . We take our reader through ODEs for each of the ﬁve SP genes , the products of which are the basis of this model - e . g . en and EN are products of the engrailed gene where en is the mRNA form and EN is the protein form . Note 2 . 4 . 1 Our reader may recall that some of the interactions depicted in von Dassow’s SPN ( see Fig . 2 . 2 ) originate in the cell membrane , but their a ﬀ ect nodes in the nucleus and cytoplasm . For example , EWG is membranous but an arrow therefrom depicts its action on en in the nucleus or cytoplasm of a neighbouring cell . Such an interaction , though depicted by a single arrow in Figure 2 . 2 ( for neatness ) is actually six - fold , with the same target in each cell ( see Fig . 2 . 6 ) . This is the kind of detail that does not necessarily translate in the network , but is imparted by the ODEs . We address all such details as they arise . 2 . 4 . 1 ODEs : Engrailed gene Transcription of engrailed mRNA ( en ) is induced the extracellular form of wingless protein ( EWG ) in each of the six apposite faces of surrounding cells , but inhibited by the repressor form of cubitus interruptus protein ( CN ) .

Both lower values of κ Xy terms and higher values of the respective ν Xy terms represent a more intensive inﬂuence of X upon the 45 concentration of y ( irrespective of whether this inﬂuence be positive or negative ) . A half - life , H Z , denotes the inverse of Z ’s decay rate [ 2 ] , i . e . the lower the value of H Z , the quicker Z will decay . E ﬀ ects of the seven “rate” parameters - C CI and those of the form r DifX - are intuitive ( bigger value equals higher rate or speed of reaction ) and even the product of k PTCHH and [ ZZ ] 0 ( where ZZ is one of two binding proteins ) has the e ﬀ ect of a binding rate . Finally , α Xy terms represent the proportion of inﬂuence X has over y ( compared to say , Z ) where bigger values mean greater proportional inﬂuence [ 2 ] . 2 . 5 Output All variables ( or nodes , if you prefer ) bar three , take values between zero and one . Three SP genes have multiple protein forms and the three variables whose value can exceed one correspond to three such proteins . Scaled according to their primary forms ( IWG , CI and PTC respectively ) , concentrations of EWG , CN and PH in any single cell may exceed one hundred per - cent [ 79 ] . 2 . 5 . 1 Pattern recognition : von Dassow’s & ours Any parameter set , which causes the model to replicate wild - type expression of key SP genes - en , wg and hh - is considered to be “good” ( von Dassow et al . referred to such a set as a “solution” , we call it a “striped solution” ) , irrespective of other gene products’ activity . Other gene products are considered to have a supporting role here , i . e . to maintain the wild - type expression of the key SP genes ( considered the biologically relevant “outputs” of this particular model ) [ 78 ] . Wild - type expression of key SP genes are as follows , en = ( OFF , OFF , ON , OFF ) ( 2 . 10 ) wg = ( OFF , ON , OFF , OFF ) ( 2 . 11 ) hh = ( OFF , OFF , ON , OFF ) ( 2 . 12 ) 46 i . e . en and hh are ON exclusively in cell three whereas wg is ON exclusively in cell two , noting that we consider a gene whose concentration is at least one tenth of its maximal equilibrium value ( equal to 0 . 1 ) to be “ ON ” . Although this ON - OFF threshold in an alternative approach to that of von Dassow et al . , von Dassow endorsed our approach as a perfectly reasonable alternative [ 81 ] , [ 82 ] . And in [ 2 ] von Dassow et al . state that this is crudely the approach that they took , i . e . that a gene is considered to be on if above ten per - cent of its maximal expression level and o ﬀ otherwise . When testing a parameter set , von Dassow et al . had two checkpoints , as it were . They would initially screen their system after either two hundred or six hundred minutes ( two hundred if the ICs featured wild - type expression of both en and wg and six hundred if they did not ) in the belief that this was su ﬃ cient time for the model to “settle down” , i . e . indicate its ultimate behaviour ( and this saved computational e ﬀ ort by identifying “bad” parameter sets early ) . If , at this ﬁrst checkpoint , the model had striped solution - like behaviour , it was allowed to run to a second checkpoint of one thousand minutes - this considered long enough to establish its earlier state as stable or otherwise . Only after the second checkpoint could a parameter set be called a striped solution . We used this same checkpoint method in our testing of von Dassow’s SPN model . Note 2 . 5 . 1 In our testing , we use the most ideal ICs ( featuring wild - type expression of all key SP genes - constituting the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry - see Fig . 2 . 1 ) . If , under some set of parameters , von Dassow’s SPN cannot maintain this initial characteristic asymmetry for two hundred minutes , this set of parameters is considered “bad” . On the other hand , any parameter set for which von Dassow’s SPN can maintain the initial characteristic asymmetry for two hundred minutes is considered a good candidate for a striped solution . If , under the same set of parameters , von Dassow’s SPN can maintain the initial characteristic asymmetry for one thousand minutes , this set of parameters is considered “good” as , the conditions they represent have stably maintained characteristic 47 asymmetry . In testing von Dassow’s SPN , we randomly generated four hundred and seventy two parameter sets , each of which were run for two hundred minutes . Of these , four parameter sets were good candidates for striped solutions but ( after running von Dassow’s SPN with each of these four sets for one thousand minutes ) we found that only one of these stably maintained the initial characteristic asymmetry . Only the sixty ninth randomly chosen parameter set we generated exempliﬁes a striped solution - we call it “Set 69” ( for parameter values , see table in “Inputs : Parameters” section , for values of variables under set 69 , see “Set 69” subsection and for pattern of expression represented by these values , see Fig . 2 . 3 ) . 2 . 5 . 2 Set 69 For the sixty ninth parameter set in our testing of von Dassow’s SPN , nodes had the following values after one thousand minutes , according to Matlab .

The ﬁve most fre - quently recorded behaviours found at the two hundred minute checkpoint are shown in the following table . There was a signiﬁcant number of other behaviours , all of which were seen on fewer than ten occasions . From this table , it is clear that over - expression is a common problem amongst key SP genes ( wg , en and hh ) . In over half our sample , wg expression is ubiquitous , whilst it is also true of en and hh in over a quarter of cases . en wg hh Proportion 1 ( ON , ON , ON , ON ) ( ON , ON , ON , ON ) ( ON , ON , ON , ON ) 21 % 2 ( OFF , OFF , ON , OFF ) ( ON , ON , ON , ON ) ( OFF , OFF , ON , OFF ) 20 % 3 ( OFF , OFF , ON , OFF ) ( OFF , ON , ON , OFF ) ( OFF , OFF , ON , OFF ) 7 % 4 ( OFF , OFF , ON , OFF ) ( ON , ON , ON , ON ) ( ON , ON , ON , ON ) 7 % 5 ( ON , ON , ON , ON ) ( ON , ON , ON , ON ) ( OFF , OFF , ON , OFF ) 6 % 49 2 . 6 Discussion Von Dassow et al . modeled a function which requires the cooperation of many genes . However , von Dassow et al . wanted to simplify this function as far as pos - sible , wishing to include only the essential . They believed that the characteristic asymmetry of the SPN could be modeled by as few as ﬁve genes ( engrailed , wing - less , hedgehog , cubitus interruptus and patched ) . Their model uses a system of non - linear coupled ODEs , governed by forty eight parameters , sets of which were randomly generated using a program of their own design called Ingeneue [ 1 ] , [ 4 ] . 2 . 6 . 1 Findings : von Dassow’s & ours Von Dassow et al . were surprised by just how frequently their model could replicate characteristic asymmetry of the SPN ( see Fig . 2 . 1 , this chapter’s “Introduction” and the “Development of fruit ﬂy” section in our previous chapter ) and the range of initial conditions ( ICs ) for which it was possible . Note 2 . 6 . 1 In [ 1 ] , von Dassow et al . report the frequency with which their model could replicate the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry for a series of di ﬀ erent ICs . For “Close to target pattern” ICs ( featuring wild - type expression of en , wg and hh ) , an average of one in forty - six randomly chosen parameter sets replicated characteristic asymmetry in their SPN model ( where 21 , 526 sets were tested ) . For “Crisp” ICs ( featuring wild - type expression of en and wg ) , an average of one in two hundred and one randomly chosen parameter sets replicated characteristic asymmetry in their SPN model ( where 240 , 000 sets were tested ) . For “Three - cell band of ptc , stripe of en on anterior margin” ICs ( featuring wild - type expression of en ) , an average of one in two hundred and eighty ﬁve randomly chosen pa - rameter sets replicated characteristic asymmetry in their SPN model ( where 36 , 196 sets were tested ) . For “Crisp , plus ubiquitous low level of ci and ptc” ICs ( featuring wild - type expression of wg and en ) , an average of one in three hundred and seventy ﬁve randomly cho - sen parameter sets replicated characteristic asymmetry in their SPN model ( where 41 , 258 sets were tested ) . 50 For “Three - cell band of ci , stripe of wg on posterior margin” ICs ( featuring wild - type expression of wg ) , an average of one in ﬁve hundred and eighty ﬁve randomly chosen parameter sets replicated characteristic asymmetry in their SPN model ( where 40 , 338 sets were tested ) . For “Degraded” ICs ( featuring concentrations of wg highest in cell two and concentrations of en highest in cell three ) , an average of one in ﬁve thousand randomly cho - sen parameter sets replicated characteristic asymmetry in their SPN model ( where 750 , 000 sets were tested ) . For “Three - cell band of ptc , out - of - phase three - cell band of ptc , ” ICs ( featuring wild - type expression of ci but not of any of the key SP genes ) , an average of one in twelve thousand ﬁve hundred and sixty randomly chosen parameter sets replicated characteristic asymmetry in their SPN model ( where 226 , 084 sets were tested ) . This frequency of characteristic asymmetry was championed by von Dassow et al . as a show of “robustness” on the part of their SPN model ( both to parameter variation and ICs ) . As an indication of their model’s robustness to parameter variation , von Dassow et al . used an analogue of the following argument . Using their most successful ICs ( “Close to target pattern” ) , von Dassow et al . found that , four hundred and sixty four out of twenty one thousand ﬁve hundred and twenty six randomly chosen parameter sets replicate characteristic asymmetry of the SPN in a model with forty eight parameters . On average then , a random choice of parameter has chance X of being compatible with characteristic asymmetry where , X 48 = 464 21526 = ⇒ X = (cid:18) 464 21526 (cid:19) 148 = ⇒ X = 0 . 9232 . Such “good” parameter sets as these were called solutions ( we term them “striped solutions” henceforth ) . We found one out of four hundred and seventy two ran - domly chosen parameter sets in von Dassow’s SPN of forty eight parameters to be a striped solution . Using von Dassow’s argument , we found that any parameter has , on average , about an eighty eight per - cent chance of being compatible with the SPN’s desired behaviour . 51 2 . 6 . 2 Disparity between hit - rates There is a disparity between our hit - rate ( frequency of ﬁnding striped solutions amongst generated parameter sets ) and von Dassow’s . For the same set of ICs , von Dassow et al . found a hit - rate of one in forty six , whilst out hit - rate was one in four hundred and seventy two . How might we explain this ? We refer our reader to details relayed by von Dassow et al . in [ 2 ] , concerning their methods . The main thing to which we would draw attention is the way in which they searched the parameter - space . Whilst they use a random search ( as did we ) more than any other strategy , they also employ a directed search strategy ( which we did not ) . We propose that this could explain the di ﬀ erence in ﬁndings . Note 2 . 6 . 2 The goodness - of - ﬁt function their model uses to identify striped solutions sometimes makes mistakes ( accepting fewer than one in ﬁfty patterns a human would have rejected [ 2 ] ) . It is unclear however whether these false striped solutions were or were not counted as striped solutions in calculating their hit - rate . 2 . 6 . 3 Work of others Apart from von Dassow’s , there are other notable examples of SPN models . Let us begin with Ingolia’s model [ 7 ] - what were the notable di ﬀ erences between his and von Dassow’s SPN ? His model included the products of one gene von Dassow’s had not ( sloppy paired , slp ) whilst it excluded the products of the patched gene , ptc . In Ingolia’s model , it is neigbouring HH and not PTC which regulates cleavage ( cleaving of CI into CN ) and SLP ( the protein form of slp ) performs the role of CN in repressing the expression of en and hh . Expression of slp is repressed by EN . Of the ﬁve genes in Ingolia’s model - en , wg , hh , ci and slp - only the ﬁrst two enjoy induction . How about the SPN model devised by Ma et al . [ 8 ] - what were the notable di ﬀ er - ences between this and von Dassow’s ? Like Ingolia , Ma does not include products of the patched gene , ptc , but does include products of the sloppy - paired gene , slp . 52 In fact , Ma’s SPN greatly resembles Ingolia’s . Ma et al . use HH in the same cleaving role , SLP in the same en - repressing role and EN in the same slp - repressing role as Ingolia . However , in Ma’s model , expression of slp is induced by neighbouring EWG and hh is not repressed by SLP and is induced by EN . The major distinction of Ma’s model is the use of products of the mid gene as a mediator in up - regulation of wg by SLP . To elaborate , SLP down - regulates mid and , in turn , its protein MID down - regulates wg . Finally , we must mention the SPN model by Albert and Othmer [ 21 ] . Their model used the products of eight genes including smoothened , smo , and frizzled , f z ( the other six being the union of von Dassow’s and Ingolia’s ) . What other di ﬀ erences were there between their SPN and von Dassow’s ? Firstly , the patched gene , ptc , was down - regulated by EN as well as by CIR ( their name for CN ) . Secondly , the wingless signal from neighbouring cells which up - regulates en is received by re - ceptor protein FZ . Thirdly , SLP up - regulates wg and down - regulates en . Fourthly , cleaving of CIA into CIR ( equivalent to CI into CN ) is down - regulated by SMO rather than up - regulated by PTC . Finally , SMO is down - regulated by PTC but HH can block this down - regulation . One thing we must add is that Albert and Othmer’s model is Boolean . That is to say , it uses the logic gates AND , OR and NOT to determine the time - evolution of their model ( in discrete time - steps ) . For example , hh would only be considered ON if both its inducer , EN , were ON and its repressor CIR ( equivalent to CN ) were OFF ( at the previous time - step ) . A binary system is used , so nodes are either ON or OFF ( there are no varying degrees of “o ﬀ - ness” ) . In contrast , von Dassow’s , Ingolia’s and Ma’s SPN models all use systems of continuous ODEs involving so - called Hill functions . For example , in von Dassow’s SPN , the term , (cid:32) κ ν CNen CNen κ ν CNen CNen + CN ν CNen i (cid:33) 53 is a Hill function seen in the ODE which governs the concentration of en . This particular one denotes down - regulation ( of en ) by CN . On the other hand , another Hill Function ,  IWG ν WGwg i κ ν WGwg WGwg + IWG ν WGwg i  seen in the ODE which governs the concentration of wg denotes up - regulation ( of wg ) by IWG . Finally , whilst the models of von Dassow , Ingolia and Ma all measure the state of the SPN by concentrations of gene products , some modelers prefer to measure the numbers of individual particles [ 30 ] . 2 . 7 Conclusion We found it counter - intuitive that a model with such high dimensions could so readily adapt to such a large fraction of inputs ( parameter sets and initial condi - tions ) as reported in [ 1 ] . How is it that a model with so many di ﬀ erent possible outcomes ( which we would measure by the type of genetic expression ) can capture one single type with such readiness ? Note 2 . 7 . 1 The single type of outcome to which we refer here is any in which key SP genes en , wg and hh have wild - type expressions - this being the mark of the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry ( see Fig . 2 . 1 ) . Yet von Dassow et al . concluded their model to be robust to variation , both in pa - rameters and ICs ( some signiﬁcantly more successful than others ) . Unsurprisingly , they found that robustness to parameters peaked when ICs were close to wild - type expression of SP genes , i . e . when the model’s desired output matched its input . Note 2 . 7 . 2 Such ICs capture the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry so vital to a fruit ﬂy’s segment formation . We use these ICs throughout our work - see table in “Inputs : Initial conditions” . We programmed von Dassow’s fruit ﬂy model into Matlab . After testing almost ﬁve hundred random parameter sets , we found one which replicated wild - type 54 expression of key SP genes - en , wg and hh ( set 69 ) . As our testing went on , we began to realise that , whether it represented something commonplace ( as was claimed in [ 1 ] ) or something rare , the behaviour of von Dassow’s model under set 69 ( i . e . characteristic asymmetry ) was remarkable . We were intrigued . Note 2 . 7 . 3 Before we ask how von Dassow’s model achieves robustness , we must ﬁrst ask ourselves how it achieves characteristic asymmetry at all ( see our future chapter , “Our SPN” ) . Under set 69 , von Dassow’s SPN can maintain its characteristic genetic asymme - try , where di ﬀ erent key SP genes are expressed either side of the parasegmental boundary ( wg is expressed exclusively anterior in the second cell , en and hh are expressed exclusively posterior in the third cell of each four - cell wide , one - cell high segment in von Dassow’s SPN model ) . Thus , wild - type expression of key SP genes is asymmetrical about the parasegmental boundary and it is this genetic asymmetry which deﬁnes the boundary . Note 2 . 7 . 4 This is why we call the second cell of our SPN segment the wg domain ( of expression ) and the third cell of our SPN segment the en / hh domain ( of expression ) . The characteristic asymmetry seen in von Dassow’s SPN under set 69 is shown in Figure 2 . 3 . But notice that expression patterns individual SP gene products are symmetrical . For example , expression patterns of key SP genes en and hh are symmetrical about cell three , whilst expression patterns of key SP gene wg are symmetrical about cell two ( see Fig . 2 . 3 ) . So the characteristic asymmetry of the SPN might be thought of as multiple symmetries ( a cell two symmetry of wg , a cell three symmetry of en and hh ) in one system ( the SPN ) . Note 2 . 7 . 5 What we really wish to emphasise to our reader is that , given characteristic asymmetry represents something so unusual ( multiple symmetries in a single system ) , it is astounding that it should be seen at all , let alone robustly . This is what motivates our interest in von Dassow’s SPN . 55 2 . 7 . 1 Our next chapter Primarily we ask what it is that makes set 69 so special . Set 69 represents an internal environment of the fruit ﬂy which makes it capable of this remarkable and fascinating asymmetric patterns of genetic expression [ 1 ] . Does set 69 alone hold the key to asymmetry ( and can this be found in other parameter sets ? ) or is the architecture of von Dassow’s model equally important ? In our next chapter , we give our initial thoughts and observations concerning both . Note 2 . 7 . 6 In all future chapters , we replace the terms T 0 and ν Bci in von Dassow’s ODE system by their value of one ( see Aside 2 . 3 . 1 ) . Additionally , we shall refer to the SPN model proposed by von Dassow et al . ( as presented in this chapter ) as “von Dassow’s SPN” for convenience , the ODE description of which is given as an Appendix . 56 Chapter 3 First impressions 3 . 1 Introduction Sometimes , we ﬁnd it advisable to ﬁrst ask ourselves what we know , before con - sidering our aims . Ambition is not to be discouraged , but sometimes it can be more of a hinderance than a help . One is always liable to end up trapped in one’s own mind when hopes are , or become , inﬂexible . Thus , we begin here by sharing all we notice of von Dassow’s SPN ( and especially its behaviour under parameter set 69 ) . Originally , it was related without insight or any suggestion as to where it might lead but we have since added some retrospective notes . 3 . 1 . 1 Overview How does the SPN achieve its characteristic asymmetry , as seen in von Dassow’s SPN under parameter set 69 of our testing ? Let us suppose set 69 has properties typical of conditions under which characteristic asymmetry is replicated in von Dassow’s SPN . On this basis , we might hypothesise how weak or strong the in - teractions between SP nodes should be . Recall , von Dassow’s network shows all possible interactions in a cell , but many of these do not take place in certain cells whether because an interaction is weak ( as a result of associated parameters ) or because the source of the interaction ( a node ) is turned o ﬀ . 57 Many of parameter set 69’s values are sensitive to perturbation , i . e . altering a single value can cause a qualitative change in behaviour of von Dassow’s SPN . Some parameters are shown to have only narrow “working ranges” ( the range of values for which characteristic asymmetry is maintained in von Dassow’s SPN ) . Are such parameters more signiﬁcant to the success of the system ? Does this bring into question the system’s alleged robustness ? Many parameters are highly ﬂexi - ble , showing wide working ranges , but there remains a signiﬁcant number which are inﬂexible for set 69 . Many of von Dassow’s ODEs contain so - called Hill functions . For set 69 , these functions take values near one or near zero . We examine their behaviour , which follows that of a dose - response ( D - R ) curve . A D - R curve has interesting features that may make them useful in the assessment of what makes a good parameter set , e . g . the position and gradient of its slope . Finally , the value of the CI / CN - wg link in von Dassow’s SPN ( under set 69 ) was near zero in all cells ( less than 4 . 3 × 10 − 12 in all cells ) , which is equivalent to an absence of CI / CN - regulation of wg - is this signiﬁcant , i . e . does it typify the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry ? 3 . 2 Intensity of interactions in von Dassow’s SPN In our previous chapter , we described parameter set 69 under which von Dassow’s SPN produces its characteristic asymmetry ( simultaneous wild - type expression of key SP genes en , wg and hh - see Figures 2 . 1 and 2 . 3 ) . For the duration of this chapter , let us suppose that set 69 is typical of its kind , i . e . from a region in parameter - space containing a relatively large numbers of “good” parameter sets ( those capable of producing characteristic asymmetry ) , then what might we infer ? We propose that the intensity of interactions in von Dassow’s SPN is the primary factor in determining its outcome , where terms of the form κ ν Xy Xy ( in von Dassow’s ODEs ) might be said to represent the intensity of X ’s regulation on y ( where X 58 is a protein , y the target of regulation ) . Below , we tabulate the values of such intensities ( for set 69 ) , which can range between 10 − 30 and one ( with the exception of κ ν Bci Bci ∈ [ 10 − 3 , 1 ] ) . Term Set 69 value Implication ? κ ν WGen WGen 6 . 8689 × 10 − 10 EWG induction of en must be strong κ ν CNen CNen 0 . 0023 CN repression of en must be weak κ ν WGwg WGwg 6 . 9783 × 10 − 6 IWG induction of wg must not be weak κ ν CIwg CIwg 0 . 1752 CI induction of wg must be weak κ ν CNwg CNwg 7 . 8318 × 10 − 12 CN repression of wg must be strong κ ν CIptc CIptc 6 . 4644 × 10 − 9 CI induction of ptc must be strong κ ν CNptc CNptc 0 . 8691 CN repression of ptc must be weak κ ν Bci Bci 0 . 0033 B induction of ci must not be weak κ ν ENci ENci 6 . 1137 × 10 − 15 EN repression of ci must be strong κ ν PTCCI PTCCI 1 . 0085 × 10 − 18 PTC cleavage of CI must be strong κ ν ENhh ENhh 2 . 4747 × 10 − 5 EN induction of hh must not be weak κ ν CNhh CNhh 7 . 5745 × 10 − 22 CN repression of hh must be strong In what follows , we o ﬀ er an explanation of these implications ( see table ) . 3 . 2 . 1 Regulation of en : Intensity Concentrations of en ’s inducer , EWG are initially low for our ICs . We propose the intensity of this induction should be strong , by way of compensation . With such weak induction , we propose that repression of en should be likewise - otherwise CN - repression might squash EWG ’s induction and thus expression of en . Note 3 . 2 . 1 Concentrations of active CN are conspicuously high for set 69 ( CN i equals 1 . 2738 for i (cid:44) 3 ) and so the comparative weak intensity of the CN - en link here may be atypical . More generally , active CN may not reach such high concentrations and lower concentrations would require a higher intensity . As we ﬁnd out in future chapter “Our SPN” , active CN concentrations are seldom this high for characteristic asymmetry . 59 3 . 2 . 2 Regulation of wg : Intensity Two of wg ’s regulating proteins , CI and CN ( inducer and repressor respectively ) , are signiﬁcantly more active in cells one , two and four under set 69 . Unless active CN squashes active CI - induction , CI induces wg outside the wg - domain ( wild - type wg is expressed only in cell two ) . Hence , CN - repression needs to be strong , but CI - induction must be weak also , otherwise wg may be turned on where CN - repression is inactive . It is IWG - induction which should dominate , as CI and CN must cancel out each other’s regulation . 3 . 2 . 3 Regulation of ptc : Intensity For set 69 , the mode of ptc expression matches that of its regulating proteins ( inducer CI and repressor CN ) , i . e . lower presence in cell three . As this matches our ICs , a status quo should be maintained as long as CN - repression is not strong enough to turn ptc o ﬀ in all cells , nor CI - induction strong enough to turn ptc on in all cells . 3 . 2 . 4 Regulation of ci : Intensity Repression of ci has to be of a certain strength as its inducer B is constant and ubiquitously active . That is , only ci ’s repressor EN can impose ( or “maintain” , given our ICs ) wild - type stripes of ci ( by preventing expression in cell three ) . 3 . 2 . 5 Cleavage of CI : Intensity It is di ﬃ cult to know how important the strength of CI - cleavage ( process which down - regulates CI whilst up - regulating CN ) is to the SPN’s characteristic asymme - try . Though one could argue that strong CI - cleavage helps maintain the wild - type expression of wg ( noting that wg is regulated by CI - induction and CN - repression ) . We propose that strong CI - cleavage lends itself to levels of CI and CN expression 60 which , together , can nullify the CI / CN - wg link ( see “Autoregulation of wing - less” section in this chapter ) . 3 . 2 . 6 Regulation of hh : Intensity Under set 69 , EN - induction and CN - repression of hh compliment each other , mak - ing their task easy . Except that one of these links ( EN - hh , CN - hh ) is extreme , i . e . particularly weak or strong , wild - type expression of hh should be maintained . 3 . 3 Parameter sensitivity How sensitive are the parameters of von Dassow’s SPN ( to perturbation ) ? Whilst setting all other parameters by their set 69 value , we vary each parameter in turn . Varying most of the system’s parameters did not result in a change of overall behaviour , i . e . wild - type expression of key SP genes en , wg and hh was maintained . Parameters which do alter overall behaviour did not do so in the following ranges . A value with an asterisk indicates that at least one of the key SP genes underwent a sudden change in its mode of expression , e . g . from wild - type to ubiquitous . A value without an asterisk indicates that at least one of the key SP genes underwent a gradual movement away from wild - type expression . We o ﬀ er an interpretation of each result . Aside 3 . 3 . 1 Like von Dassow’s testing , we only ran the model for two hundred minutes here as to run set 69 just once took a substantial amount of time ( and we ran it here after each perturbation of each parameter ) . In consequence , some of the following ranges are probably less restrictive than they would have been , had we run the system for one thousand minutes . 3 . 3 . 1 Inputs to en 0 . 0520 ∗ < κ WGen ≤ 0 . 6 61 As is the case throughout this section , let us assume any trends seen are typical of a striped solution . It seems that EWG - induction ( the potency of which is denoted by κ WGen which takes values between 0 . 001 and one ) can be both excessively and insu ﬃ ciently potent . As we might expect , the former lead to ubiquitous expression of en and hh and the latter to its absence . Note 3 . 3 . 1 When we describe a protein’s induction as potent , we think of an abundance of protein , i . e . many protein molecules attempting to perform some job , usually through interaction with another molecule ; either DNA or some other protein in this system . κ CNen ≤ 0 . 3490 ∗ It appears the main danger for CN - repression of en ( the potency of which is denoted by κ CNen which takes values between 0 . 001 and one ) is that it may be too impotent . When this happens , en and hh are turned on in every cell . Note 3 . 3 . 2 When we describe CN’s repression as impotent , we think of too few protein molecules attempting to physically block transcription of en . When activated , CN tries to bind close to that section of DNA containing the engrailed gene such that the enzyme attempting to transcribe en ( RNA polymerase ) is prevented from so doing . ν WGen ≥ 2 . 0134 According to this , EWG - induction of en ( the cooperativity of which is denoted by ν WGen which takes values between one and ten ) can be too uncooperative . If this happens , expression of en and hh may be completely absent from the system . Note 3 . 3 . 3 When we call a protein’s induction uncooperative , we think of a protein which may or may not be in plentiful supply , performing its job badly , e . g . too slowly . ν CNen > 3 . 4570 ∗ Repression of en by CN ( the cooperativity of which is denoted by ν CNwg which takes values between one and ten ) can also be too uncooperative and , when it is , en and hh are ubiquitously expressed . 62 3 . 3 . 2 Inputs to wg 0 . 02835 ∗ ≤ κ WGwg ≤ 0 . 8780 We can see that IWG - induction of wg ( the potency of which is denoted by κ WGwg which takes values between 0 . 001 and one ) comes undone at both ends of its range . Too potent an inducer results in ubiquitous expression of wg and too impotent , non - expression . κ CIwg ≥ 0 . 2170 ∗ Apparently , CI - induction of wg ( the potency of which is denoted by κ CIwg which takes values between 0 . 001 and one ) can su ﬀ er from over - potency and when it does so , wg is expressed in both the en / hh domain ( cell three ) and its own ( cell two ) . κ CNwg ≤ 0 . 1801 ∗ We can see that CN - repression of wg ( the potency of which is denoted by κ CNwg which takes values between 0 . 001 and one ) can be impotent . When this happens , wg is turned ON in the entire ci domain ( cells one , two and four ) . ν WGwg ≥ 2 . 9428 ∗ Sometimes IWG ’s induction of wg ( the cooperativity of which is denoted by ν WGwg which takes values between one and ten ) is too uncooperative and , when this occurs , wg is turned on everywhere . ν CIwg ≤ 6 . 1770 ∗ Sometimes CI ’s induction of wg ( the cooperativity of which is denoted by ν CIwg which takes values between one and ten ) is overly cooperative . When this happens , wg is turned on in the en / hh domain ( cell three ) as well as its own ( cell two ) . 3 . 3 . 3 Inputs to IWG / EWG r ExoWG ≤ 0 . 0620 63 Exocytosis ( the rate of which is denoted by r ExoWG which takes values between 0 . 001 and one ) can take place at an excessive rate . That is , the rate at which IWG moves out of the cell can be too high here and , when it is , wg is turned on everywhere . 3 . 3 . 4 Inputs to ptc κ CNptc ≥ 0 . 1654 When CN ’s repression of ptc expression ( the potency of which is denoted by κ CNptc which takes values between 0 . 001 and one ) is too potent , en and hh are turned on in all cells , whilst wg is turned on in the ci - domain ( cells one , two and four ) . Aside 3 . 3 . 2 This perhaps reﬂects what we said in relation to the need for CI - cleavage earlier in this chapter . If CN squashes ptc expression , its protein PTC is not activated and cannot cleave CI ( of which the product is CN ) . Thus , CN is not activated and its repression is absent from the SPN . Over - expression of its target genes ( those upon which it can act ) results . 3 . 3 . 5 Inputs to ci κ Bci ≤ 0 . 4362 When ci ’s basal induction ( the potency of which is denoted by κ Bci which takes values between 0 . 001 and one ) is too impotent , both en and hh are turned on in all cells . Aside 3 . 3 . 3 Impotence of inducer , B , causes under - expression of ci , a result of which is lower protein ( CI and CN ) concentration . Lower CN concentrations result in the over - expression of its target genes , en and hh . 0 . 0064 ≤ κ ENci < 0 . 3104 64 Repression of ci expression by EN ( the potency of which is denoted by κ ENci which takes values between 0 . 001 and one ) can be both too potent ( this leads to over - expression of both en and hh ) and too impotent ( which leads to non - expression of both en and hh , whilst wg is over - expressed ; ON in the en / hh domain ) . ν ENci ≥ 2 . 4377 When EN repression of ci ( the cooperativity of which is denoted by ν ENci which takes values between one and ten ) is too uncooperative , both en and hh are turned o ﬀ in all cells , whilst wg is turned ON in both cells two and three ( i . e . over - expressed ) . 3 . 3 . 6 Inputs to CI / CN κ PTCCI ≤ 0 . 2808 If PTC ’s cleavage of CI into CN ( the potency of which is denoted by κ PTCCI which takes values between 0 . 001 and one ) is too impotent , en and hh are turned on in every cell ( perhaps because their CN - repression dwindles ) . H CN ≥ 55 . 0969 When CN ’s half - life ( denoted by H CN which takes values between ﬁve and one hundred ) is too low ( or alternatively ; when the rate at which CN decays is too high ) we ﬁnd that en and hh are ubiquitously expressed , whilst wg is expressed in the ci domain ( cells one , two and four ) . C CI ≥ 0 . 0860 When the rate of CI - cleavage ( the rate of which is denoted by C CI which takes values between 0 . 001 and one ) is too low , en and hh are ubiquitously expressed , whilst wg is expressed in the ci domain ( cells one , two and four ) . Let us summarise this section . Summary 3 . 3 . 1 We have a set of forty eight parameter values ( set 69 ) which , together , produce wild - type expression of key SP genes en , wg and hh in von Dassow’s SPN . 65 Seventeen of these parameters ( over one third of the whole set ) can single - handedly disrupt such behaviour . And eight of these seventeen can cause a sudden change in behaviour , when perturbed ( where all eight are associated to the ODEs of key SP genes ) . Interestingly , none of the parameters associated to the ODEs of hh were able to alter the system’s behaviour . Does this mean hh - expression is more robust than that of other key SP genes en and wg ? Von Dassow et al . did similar testing for some striped solutions . How do our ﬁndings compare ? 3 . 3 . 7 Findings : Ours & von Dassow’s In [ 1 ] , von Dassow et al . showed the results of testing ﬁve striped solutions in this way , where some parameters were sensitive to change . Let us summarise their results . For all ﬁve striped solutions , they found that EWG - induction of en ( the potency of which is denoted by κ WGen ) could be too impotent , with higher values of κ WGen preventing a striped solution . For one striped solution , an excessive potency was similarly problematic . Aside 3 . 3 . 4 We found that both lower and higher values of κ WGen were problematic . For all ﬁve striped solutions , they found that IWG - induction of wg ( the potency of which is denoted by κ WGwg ) could be both too potent and too impotent . This reﬂects our ﬁndings . For all ﬁve striped solutions , they found that CI - induction of ptc ( the potency of which is denoted by κ CIptc ) could be too impotent , with higher values of κ CIptc preventing a striped solution . For one striped solution , an excessive potency had the same e ﬀ ect . Aside 3 . 3 . 5 For set 69 , we did not ﬁnd sensitive values of κ CIptc . For all ﬁve striped solutions , they found that CN - repression of ptc ( the potency of which is denoted by κ CNptc ) could be too potent , with lower values of κ CNptc preventing a striped solution . This reﬂects our ﬁndings . For all ﬁve striped solutions , they found that EN - repression of ci ( the potency of which is denoted by κ ENci ) could be both too potent and too impotent . This reﬂects our ﬁndings . For just 66 two striped solutions , they found that CN - repression of hh ( the potency of which is denoted by κ CNhh ) could be too potent , with lower values of κ CNhh preventing a striped solution . Note 3 . 3 . 4 For set 69 , we did not ﬁnd sensitive values of κ CNhh . For four striped solutions , they found that cleavage of CI into CN ( the rate of which is denoted by C CI ) could be too slow . This reﬂects our ﬁndings . To summarise , it seems that κ CIptc and κ CNhh were unusually insensitive to change ( for set 69 ) . Generally though , we are pleased that there were many similarities in what we and von Dassow et al . found ( this reassures us that set 69 is not wildly atypical , so our earlier are not irrelevant ) . 3 . 4 Repression terms Under set 69 , all terms of the form ( describing repression in von Dassow’s SPN ) , (cid:32) κ ν REPx REPx κ ν REPx REPx + REP ν REPx i (cid:33) ( 3 . 1 ) equal one when REP is not active . Here REP is some repressor , whose presence in the cell is small and x is the target ( gene ) of repression . Let us suppose this is a typical feature of striped solutions . It suggests that either , all “intensity terms” of the type seen in the numerator of ( 3 . 1 ) are big ( which , as we saw for set 69 , they are not ) or that there is a certain degree of smallness which concentrations of REP must achieve when REP is inactive . Note that one is the maximal value of ( 3 . 1 ) , so we might infer that , when REP is inactive , repression must not only be weak , but at its weakest . Thus , there must be zero inhibition of the target gene’s expression when REP is inactive . Note 3 . 4 . 1 We propose a condition for characteristic asymmetry in von Dassow’s SPN , REP ν REPx i ≤ 10 − 5 κ ν REPx REPx for which small κ REPx plus small ν REPx would be least ideal . As κ REPx is 0 . 001 at its smallest , this condition would be satisﬁed for von Dassow’s SPN independently of κ REPx and ν REPx 67 for REP i less than , or equal to 10 − 8 ( and this was the case for set 69 , where REP i is either EN 1 , 2 , 4 or CN 3 ) . Why does repression behave this way in von Dassow’s SPN ? Let us say that ( 3 . 1 ) is some Hill function , say f = f ( REP i ) . As such functions are seen throughout von Dassow’s ODE model , we ask how they behave over time ? As REP i is a function of τ , we have ( by the chain rule of di ﬀ erentiation ) , d f d τ = d f dREP i × dREP i d τ where , d f dREP i = − κ ν REPx REPx ν REPx REP ν REPx − 1 i (cid:16) κ ν REPx REPx + REP ν REPx i (cid:17) = f (cid:2) 1 − f (cid:3) (cid:18) − ν REPx REP i (cid:19) . ( 3 . 2 ) Hill function f ( REP i ) is at rest when df d τ equals zero and it is clear that this is the case when df dREP i equals zero which occurs for f equals one ( and for f equals zero ) as shown by ( 3 . 2 ) . 3 . 4 . 1 Dose - response curves Figure 3 . 1 : Dose - response ( D - R ) curve . Behaviour of Hill functions , e . g . see ( 3 . 1 ) , follows that of a dose - response ( D - R ) curve ( as shown in Figure 3 . 1 where the value of ( 3 . 1 ) is plotted against REP ) . Does this have any properties which may be useful in determining good parameters ? Let us say that the Hill function in ( 3 . 1 ) is f = f ( REP i ) , then the gradient of its 68 associated D - R curve is given by ( 3 . 2 ) . At the point where values of REP i and κ REPx are equal , the slope locates the midpoint of the vertical axis and here the gradient is − ν REPx 4 κ REPx . Therefore , the curve becomes steeper for larger values of ν REPx or smaller values of κ REPx , which could perhaps be combined as “for smaller values of κ ν REPx REPx ” . The steeper this sloped part of the D - R curve , the more switch - like the behavior of the represented Hill function . Note 3 . 4 . 2 In our future “Stripes” chapter , we go on to ﬁnd a simple method for predicting bad parameter sets for von Dassow’s SPN using these properties of D - R curves . 3 . 5 Autoregulation of wingless Under set 69 , two of wg ’s three regulating proteins ( CI and CN ) have modes of expression which are symmetric about cell three ( see Fig . 2 . 3 in previous chapter ) . However , wg ’s mode of expression under set 69 is not symmetric about cell three . How is wg - expression able to break away from the third cell symmetry seen in the expression of its regulators ? Let us consider wg at steady state such that , wg i = α CIwg  CI i  κν CNwgCNwg κν CNwgCNwg + CN ν CNwgi  ν CIwg κ ν CIwgCIwg + CI i  κν CNwgCNwg κν CNwgCNwg + CN ν CNwgi  ν CIwg  + α WGwg (cid:32) IWG ν WGwgi κ ν WGwgWGwg + IWG ν WGwgi (cid:33) 1 + α CIwg   CI i  κν CNwgCNwg κν CNwgCNwg + CN ν CNwgi  ν CIwg κ ν CIwg CIwg + CI i   κν CNwgCNwg κν CNwg CNwg + CN ν CNwg i  ν CIwg   + α WGwg (cid:32) IWG ν WGwgi κ ν WGwgWGwg + IWG ν WGwgi (cid:33) . in which ( 3 . 3 ) describes the regulation of wg by CI and CN . α CIwg       CI i (cid:32) κ ν CNwgCNwg κ ν CNwgCNwg + CN ν CNwg i (cid:33) ν CIwg κ ν CIwg CIwg + CI i (cid:32) κ ν CNwgCNwg κ ν CNwgCNwg + CN ν CNwg i (cid:33) ν CIwg       ( 3 . 3 ) If ( 3 . 3 ) were zero ( or negligibly small ) for all i then the symmetry of CI and CN expression could not be imposed on wg at steady state . And indeed , we found that ( 3 . 3 ) was small enough for all i to be considered negligible for set 69 ( less than 69 4 . 3 × 10 − 12 in all cells ) . When ( 3 . 3 ) is negligible , we can see that expression of the wingless gene ( of which wg and IWG are products ) is entirely auto - regulated , i . e . wg activates IWG and IWG , in turn , induces wg in a positive feedback loop . Let us suppose that this is typical of striped solutions , then we could say that , wg i ≈ α WGwg (cid:32) IWG ν WGwgi κ ν WGwgWGwg + IWG ν WGwgi (cid:33) 1 + α WGwg (cid:32) IWG ν WGwgi κ ν WGwgWGwg + IWG ν WGwgi (cid:33) ( 3 . 4 ) at steady state , when characteristic asymmetry in seen in von Dassow’s SPN . Note 3 . 5 . 1 We propose that this is a key to the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry . We are able to elaborate in our future chapter , “Our SPN” . 3 . 6 Restrictions on cubitus interruptus nodes Let us recall that there are three gene products of the cubitus interruptus gene - an mRNA ( ci ) and two proteins ( CI and CN ) . Are their concentrations restricted in von Dassow’s SPN ? Consider the equation of motion for CI at steady state and rearrange for ci , ci i =  1 + H CI C CI  PTC ν PTCCI i , T κ ν PTCCI PTCCI + PTC ν PTCCI i , T  CI i . ( 3 . 5 ) As the coe ﬃ cient of CI i in ( 3 . 5 ) is greater than one , CI i must be smaller than ci i at steady state . And as ( 2 . 6 ) , the ODE for ci , shows that ci takes values between zero and one at steady state , so too must CI . What about CN ? Adding steady state expressions for CI and CN yields , CN i = H CN H CI ( ci i − CI i ) ( 3 . 6 ) and , since CI i is less than ci i , we can see that CN i must be less than one when H CN is less than H CI but that CN i may exceed one when H CN is greater than H CI . What does ( 3 . 6 ) mean ? When von Dassow’s SPN is at steady state , CN is equal to the di ﬀ erence between ci and CI , scaled by the ratio of half - lives H CN and H CI . 70 Note 3 . 6 . 1 For most variables in von Dassow’s SPN , a value of one indicates that their concentration has reached one hundred per - cent of its maximum . Yet , when CN has a bigger half - life ( or , smaller decay rate ) than CI , CN’s value may exceed one . This does not mean that it has exceeded one hundred per - cent of its maximum , merely that CN potentially accumulates to much higher concentrations than CI . From ( 3 . 6 ) , we see that the di ﬀ erence in concentrations of CI and CN is magniﬁed according to how sustainable they are . This magniﬁcation was thought useful when CI and CN regulate the same gene , e . g . key SP gene wg . 3 . 7 Extracellular nodes Figure 3 . 2 : For set 69 , cell faces marked with the same shape have equal concen - trations of EWG ( left ) or PTC , HH and PH ( right ) . Let X be an extracellular node of von Dassow’s SPN under set 69 . Then , as shown in Figure 3 . 2 , X i − 1 , 1 = X i − 1 , 4 = X i + 1 , 1 = X i + 1 , 4 X i − 1 , 2 = X i − 1 , 3 = X i + 1 , 5 = X i + 1 , 6 X i − 1 , 5 = X i − 1 , 6 = X i + 1 , 2 = X i + 1 , 3 X i , 1 = X i , 4 X i , 2 = X i , 3 = X i , 5 = X i , 6 X i + 2 , 1 = X i + 2 , 4 X i + 2 , 2 = X i + 2 , 3 = X i + 2 , 5 = X i + 2 , 6 71 where i equals two for X = EWG and three for X = PTC , HH or PH ( the element of the subscripts to the left of the comma is modulo four ) . Thus , the sameness we see amongst EWG nodes matches the sameness we see amongst PTC , HH and PH nodes , but shifted along by one cell . Note 3 . 7 . 1 As an Appendix , we prove that there exists a mathematical symmetry within the EWG nodes which can account for much of the sameness of EWG nodes in von Das - sow’s SPN under set 69 at steady state ( see Fig . 3 . 2 ) A mathematical symmetry exists if the interchange of symmetric variables within a set of equations ( e . g . von Dassow’s ODEs ) gives the same set . For a set of ODEs at steady state , values of symmetric variables match . As the values of other extracellular nodes ( PTC , HH and PH ) match at steady state ( see Fig . 3 . 2 ) , we propose that these nodes too are mathematically symmetrical ( in a similar manner to EWG nodes ) . However , we were unable to prove the existence of other such symmetries - those of the PTC , HH and PH nodes - and this was perhaps because their associated ODEs all have non - linear parts whereas ODEs associated to EWG are purely linear . Note 3 . 7 . 2 In our future “Our SPN” chapter , we enforce the intrinsic symmetry of EWG nodes , which allows us to simplify von Dassow’s SPN model . 3 . 8 Discussion : Robust yet fragile Under set 69 , von Dassow’s SPN captures its characteristic asymmetry ( wild - type expression of key SP genes en , wg and hh ) . In this chapter , we have treated set 69 as if it had properties typical of parameter sets which capture characteristic asymmetry in von Dassow’s SPN . In “Parameter sensitivity” we showed that this ( set 69 and , by extension , the characteristic asymmetry it embodies ) can be fragile . But in [ 1 ] , von Dassow et al . found that characteristic asymmetry in their SPN model is robust to parameter variation . Can a system be both robust and fragile ? Yes - Kitano explains in [ 33 ] that “robust yet fragile” is a characteristic quality of many systems designed 72 to be robust against certain “expected” perturbations ( those which perhaps are most prevalent and , as such , threaten a species most ) . However , these same systems can often be highly fragile to “unexpected” perturbations ( perhaps caused by some condition ( s ) not formerly experienced by a species ) . 3 . 9 Conclusion This chapter preempts most of what follows in this thesis . Small observations in this section provoked most of our future ideas . The next chapter “Jacobian” con - fronts the apparently fragile nature of von Dassow’s SPN model under parameter set 69 . Can a system be sensitive to the perturbation of single parameters ( as we saw in our “Parameter sensitivity” section ) and yet remain stable ? In future chapter , “Our SPN” , our reduction of von Dassow’s model draws on the membranous symmetries of EWG and the suggested robustness of hh . In the same chapter , we add details to the issue raised in our “Autoregulation of wing - less” section here . Another future chapter , “Stripes” , draws almost entirely on themes of this chapter’s “Dose - response curves” subsection . This subsection is also used in our next chapter , “Jacobian” . 3 . 9 . 1 Our next chapter We have seen throughout this chapter that the characteristic asymmetry of the SPN ( as seen in von Dassow’s SPN under set 69 ) can be fragile to small changes in conditions . But as this asymmetry reﬂects the building of segments on a fruit ﬂy’s developing body , it must be maintained in a stable fashion ( over time ) however fragile it may be to some perturbations . In our next chapter , we again treat the characteristic asymmetry captured in von Dassow’s SPN under set 69 as typical , asking what properties make characteristic asymmetry stable . 73 Chapter 4 Jacobian 4 . 1 Introduction Under set 69 , von Dassow’s SPN exhibits characteristic behaviour ( as key genes en , wg and hh are naturally expressed - see Fig . 2 . 3 ) and we can show that this is stable , using numerical analysis ( e . g . Matlab ) . However , we would like to know which qualities of set 69 make it stable - are these qualities always necessary for wild - type expression of key genes in the SPN ? For this , we need to employ non - numerical analysis . Use of a large Jacobian matrix to ﬁnd eigenvalues proved di ﬃ cult , until we began to notice something familiar . The partial derivatives ( of ODEs which ﬁll the Jaco - bian ) can often be expressed in terms of a variable’s steady state expression . Under set 69 , many variables ( of von Dassow’s SPN ) took near binary values , i . e . close to either one or zero . And because of the now simpliﬁed nature of Jacobian entries , it became clear that such near - binary variables would create great sparseness ( by revealing many Jacobian entries to be negligibly small for set 69 ) and this made ﬁnding most eigenvalues ( indicators of stability ) easy . 74 4 . 2 Stability Let us explore the stability of the steady state ( of von Dassow’s ODE system ) reached under parameter set 69 . We use the following notation throughout this section . Note 4 . 2 . 1 Let a be a vector containing all a i for i ∈ [ 1 , 132 ] , i . e . a = ( a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a 132 ) . Although a system of one hundred and thirty two dimensions , each ODE shares the same basic form , dx i d τ = f i ( x ) ( 4 . 1 ) where i ∈ [ 1 , 132 ] . Let our steady state be x ∗ , i . e . such that , f i ( x ∗ ) = 0 ( 4 . 2 ) and our interest lies with points in the neighbourhood of x ∗ , i . e . points of type , x i = x i ∗ + v i ( 4 . 3 ) where v i is a small perturbation . How do such points behave ? If they move away from our steady state over time , then the steady state is unstable and , in this case , v i will grow in size . Alternatively , a stable steady state would correspond to shrinking v i . Hence we ask - how do v i behave over time ? From ( 4 . 3 ) , we know that , dv i d τ = dx i d τ because x i ∗ is constant and , by substituting ( 4 . 1 ) into the the right hand side ( RHS ) , we obtain , dv i d τ = f i ( x ) . Into this , we substitute the vector form of ( 4 . 3 ) ( i . e . x = x ∗ + v ) giving dv i d τ = f i ( x ∗ + v ) the RHS of which we now expand as a Taylor series , dv i d τ = f i ( x ∗ ) + ∂ f i ∂ x 1 ( x ∗ ) v 1 + ∂ f i ∂ x 2 ( x ∗ ) v 2 + . . . + ∂ f i ∂ x 132 ( x ∗ ) v 132 + H . O . T . 75 We can simplify our RHS using ( 4 . 2 ) and , noting that higher order terms ( H . O . T . ) must be negligibly small ( since v i is small ) , dv i d τ = ∂ f i ∂ x 1 ( x ∗ ) v 1 + ∂ f i ∂ x 2 ( x ∗ ) v 2 + . . . + ∂ f i ∂ x 132 ( x ∗ ) v 132 which could also be expressed in the form , dv i d τ = (cid:18) ∂ f i ∂ x 1 ( x ∗ ) ∂ f i ∂ x 2 ( x ∗ ) . . . ∂ f i ∂ x 132 ( x ∗ ) (cid:19)  v 1 v 2 . . . v 132  and von Dassow’s entire system can be expressed in this fashion , i . e .  dv 1 d τ dv 2 d τ . . . dv 132 d τ  =  ∂ f 1 ∂ x 1 ( x ∗ ) ∂ f 1 ∂ x 2 ( x ∗ ) · · · ∂ f 1 ∂ x 132 ( x ∗ ) ∂ f 2 ∂ x 1 ( x ∗ ) ∂ f 2 ∂ x 2 ( x ∗ ) · · · ∂ f 2 ∂ x 132 ( x ∗ ) . . . . . . . . . . . . ∂ f 132 ∂ x 1 ( x ∗ ) ∂ f 132 ∂ x 2 ( x ∗ ) · · · ∂ f 132 ∂ x 132 ( x ∗ )   v 1 v 2 . . . v 132  ( 4 . 4 ) and the matrix on the RHS here , we call the Jacobian of von Dassow’s system . May our reader recall that a steady state ( of von Dassow’s SPN ) is stable if v i shrink to zero over time , i . e . if v = 0 is a stable steady state of the linear system ( 4 . 4 ) . And it is the eigenvalues of the Jacobian which determines whether or not this steady state is stable . 4 . 2 . 1 Eigenvalues Eigenvalues are associated to so - called eigenvectors which , in turn , are associated to a square matrix . Eigenvectors are ( non - zero ) vectors that do not change direc - tion after multiplication by the matrix ( to which they are associated ) . Thus , an eigenvector u associated to the Jacobian of von Dassow’s system , J , must satisfy the following equation , Ju = λ u ( 4 . 5 ) 76 where λ is an associated eigenvalue . How do we use ( 4 . 5 ) to calculate eigenvalues ( indicators of stability ) ? Rearranging ( 4 . 5 ) , we obtain , ( J − λ I ) u = 0 ( 4 . 6 ) where I is the identity matrix whose dimension matches that of J . We recall that u is a non - zero vector , thus left multiplying both sides of ( 4 . 5 ) by the inverse of ( J − λ I ) would produce a contradiction . To avoid this contradiction , ( J − λ I ) must be non - invertible , i . e . its determinant must be zero . That is , eigenvalues of J are solutions to , det ( J − λ I ) = 0 . We recall that , if all eigenvalues associated to J ( for some steady state ) have negative , real parts , the steady state is stable . Note 4 . 2 . 2 All one hundred and thirty two eigenvalues of J can be found numerically using Matlab - all were real and negative ( see Appendix ) . Using non - numerical analysis , we can ﬁnd one hundred and eight eigenvalues , seventy nine of which are su ﬃ ciently simple to report . Let us state the Hartman - Grobman Theorem [ 71 ] , [ 72 ] , [ 73 ] , [ 74 ] , [ 75 ] . Theorem 4 . 2 . 1 If an n th - order system of di ﬀ erential equations has an equilibrium e with linearisation matrix , A , and if A has no zero or pure imaginary eigenvalues , then the phase portrait for the system near the equilibrium is obtained from the phase portrait of the linearised system Dy = Ay via a continuous change of coordinates . 4 . 3 Our Jacobian entries Given as an appendix are the non - zero entries for our one hundred and thirty two sided square Jacobian matrix , J . 77 4 . 3 . 1 Jacobian for von Dassow’s SPN Although it is not possible to provide our reader with a detailed image of the Jaco - bian ( because of its size ) we provide at least an idea of where its non - zero entries lie ( see Fig . 4 . 1 ) . An individual row or column of Figure 4 . 1 represents a single type of variable here , e . g . en i rather than en 1 , en 2 , en 3 or en 4 ( to which separate rows are assigned in J itself ) . That is , the horizontal and vertical lines in Figure 4 . 1 divide the di ﬀ erent types of node . For example , the ﬁrst row of Figure 4 . 1 represents partial derivatives of the ODEs which govern nodes of type en ( i . e . en 1 , en 2 , en 3 and en 4 ) . Thus , one row of Figure 4 . 1 corresponds to four of J . Note 4 . 3 . 1 There are thirteen separate horizontal and vertical sections in Figure 4 . 1 , each section representing one of the thirteen di ﬀ erent types of node in von Dassow’s SPN . The ordering of these sections are as follows - en , EN , wg , IWG , EWG , ptc , PTC , ci , CI , CN , hh , HH and PH ( left to right and / or top to bottom respectively ) . 4 . 4 Breakdown of eigenvalue problem As we can see from Figure 4 . 1 , J has a block ( lower ) triangular structure . That is , J =  X 0 Y Z  where X , Y and Z are block matrices containing non - zero entries , whereas 0 denotes a block matrix composed exclusively of zero entries . Eigenvalues of J can be found as a combination of those associated to blocks X and Z . Since Z is a diagonal ( twenty four - sided square ) matrix , Z =       − 1 H PH 0 . . . 0 0 − 1 H PH . . . 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 0 . . . − 1 H PH       78 Figure 4 . 1 : Structure of Jacobian J associated to von Dassow’s SPN , where un - shaded regions contain only zeros . The thirteen individual rows and / or columns represent nodes of type en i , EN i , wg i , IWG i , EWG i , j , ptc i , PTC i , j , ci i , CI i , CN i , hh i , HH i , j and PH i , j respectively . So , for example , the overlap of the third row and fourth col - umn here contains the partial derivatives of the ODEs associated to nodes of type wg i ( wg 1 , wg 2 , wg 3 , wg 4 ) with respect to nodes of type IWG i ( IWG 1 , IWG 2 , IWG 3 , IWG 4 ) . And this region ( the overlap ) is shaded because not all entries therein are zero . On the other hand , the overlap of the sixth row and second column here contains the partial derivatives of the ODEs associated to nodes of type ptc i ( ptc 1 , ptc 2 , ptc 3 , ptc 4 ) with respect to nodes of type EN i ( EN 1 , EN 2 , EN 3 , EN 4 ) and this region ( the overlap ) is unshaded as all entries therein are zero . 79 its associated eigenvalues are given by those entries which line its ( leading ) diag - onal . That is , each of the twenty four eigenvalues associated to Z is given by the same λ , λ = − 1 H PH . Thus , we have also found twenty four of the eigenvalues associated to J . The other one hundred and eight are associated to our other block matrix X . However , this matrix does not share the simple diagonal structure of Z . Is there any way in which we could simplify the structure of X ? 4 . 4 . 1 Hidden simplicity in X As can be seen in our Appendix , J contains some very complicated expressions , but here we show that some have obvious simpliﬁcations . For example , ∂ f i ∂ ACT i = x i ( 1 − x i ) ACT i H x ( 4 . 7 ) ∂ f i ∂ REP i = x i ( x i − 1 ) REP i H x (cid:32) REP ν REPx i κ ν REPx REPx + REP ν REPx i (cid:33) ν ACTx ν REPx ( 4 . 8 ) where x i , ACT i and REP i here are equilibria . Also , we have , ∂ k i ∂ IWG i = (cid:32) 1 − wg i IWG i H wg (cid:33) (cid:32) α WGwg ν WGwg B i ( 1 − B i ) 1 + α CIwg A i + α WGwg B i (cid:33) ( 4 . 9 ) ∂ k i ∂ CI i = (cid:32) 1 − wg i CI i H wg (cid:33) (cid:32) α CIwg A i ( 1 − A i ) 1 + α CIwg A i + α WGwg B i (cid:33) ( 4 . 10 ) ∂ k i ∂ CN i = (cid:32) wg i − 1 CN i H wg (cid:33) (cid:32) α CIwg ν CIwg ν CNwg A i ( 1 − A i ) C i 1 + α CIwg A i + α WGwg B i (cid:33) ( 4 . 11 ) where , A i =       CI i (cid:32) κ ν CNwgCNwg κ ν CNwgCNwg + CN ν CNwg i (cid:33) ν CIwg κ ν CIwg CIwg + CI i (cid:32) κ ν CNwgCNwg κ ν CNwgCNwg + CN ν CNwg i (cid:33) ν CIwg       ( 4 . 12 ) B i =     IWG ν WGwg i κ ν WGwg WGwg + IWG ν WGwg i     ( 4 . 13 ) C i =  CN ν CNwg i κ ν CNwg CNwg + CN ν CNwg i  . ( 4 . 14 ) 80 We ask : are any of these su ﬃ ciently small ( for set 69 ) to be considered as zero in the calculation of eigenvalues associated with block matrix X ? Yes , some are and this simpliﬁes greatly our eigenvalue problem . May our reader note that both the numerical eigenvalues and , where determined , their corresponding mathematical expressions are given as an appendix . 4 . 5 Eigenvalues of block matrix X We recall that J has the form , J =  X 0 Y Z  and we have found those eigenvalues associated to Z . Now that we have simpliﬁed many of its entries , we look to ﬁnd those eigenvalues associated to block matrix X ( for set 69 ) . 4 . 5 . 1 Rows 1 - 4 of X The ﬁrst four rows of X are taken from the ﬁrst four of J , which are given by the partial derivatives of en ’s ODEs . Note 4 . 5 . 1 Previously , ( 4 . 7 ) and ( 4 . 8 ) were expressed in terms of general variables x i , ACT i and REP i . For our ﬁrst four rows , they are en i , EWG n , T and CN i respectively . Both ( 4 . 7 ) and ( 4 . 8 ) will equal zero if x i equals one . This is the case in row three of X ( as en 3 equals one for set 69 ) . For the other three rows , we have very small en i and insu ﬃ ciently small EWG n , T to prevent small ( 4 . 7 ) . In these three rows , CN i is su ﬃ ciently big to make ( 4 . 8 ) small . If ( 4 . 7 ) and ( 4 . 8 ) can be approximated to zero , each of the ﬁrst four rows of X contains just one non - zero entry . Thus , for set 69 , X =     X 2 0 Y 2 Z 2     where X 2 , Y 2 and Z 2 are block matrices containing non - zero entries , whereas 0 denotes a block matrix composed exclusively of zero entries . Eigenvalues of X can 81 be found as a combination of those associated to blocks X 2 and Z 2 . Since X 2 is a diagonal ( four - sided square ) matrix , its associated eigenvalues are given by those entries which line its ( leading ) diagonal . Each of the four eigenvalues associated to X 2 is given by the same λ , λ = − 1 H en . Thus , we have also found four of the eigenvalues associated to J . The other one hundred and four are associated to our other block matrix Z 2 . 4 . 5 . 2 Rows 1 - 4 of Z 2 The ﬁrst four rows of Z 2 are taken from the ﬁfth to eighth rows of J , which are given by the partial derivatives of EN ’s ODEs . For set 69 , Z 2 =  X 3 0 Y 3 Z 3  where X 3 , Y 3 and Z 3 are block matrices containing non - zero entries , whereas 0 denotes a block matrix composed exclusively of zero entries . Eigenvalues of Z 2 can be found as a combination of those associated to blocks X 3 and Z 3 . Since X 3 is a diagonal ( four - sided square ) matrix , its associated eigenvalues are given by those entries which line its ( leading ) diagonal , i . e . each of the four eigenvalues associated to X 3 is given by the same λ , λ = − 1 H EN . Thus , we have also found four of the eigenvalues associated to J . The other one hundred are associated to our other block matrix Z 3 . 4 . 5 . 3 Rows 61 - 64 of Z 3 The sixty ﬁrst to sixty fourth rows of Z 3 are taken from the sixty ninth to seventy second rows of J , which are given by the partial derivatives of ci ’s ODEs . For set 82 69 , Z 3 =  R 0 S 0 T 0 U V W  where R , S , T , U , V and W are block matrices containing non - zero entries , whereas 0 denotes block matrices composed exclusively of zero entries . Eigenvalues of Z 3 can be found as a combination of those associated to block T and Q =  R S U W  . Since T is a diagonal ( four - sided square ) matrix , its associated eigenvalues are given by those entries which line its ( leading ) diagonal , i . e . each of the four eigenvalues associated to T is given by the same λ , λ = − 1 H ci . Thus , we have also found four of the eigenvalues associated to J . The other ninety six are associated to our other block matrix Q . 4 . 5 . 4 Rows 69 - 72 of Q The sixty ninth to seventy second rows of Q are taken from the eighty ﬁrst to eighty fourth to rows of J , which are given by the partial derivatives of hh ’s ODEs . Note 4 . 5 . 2 Recall , ( 4 . 8 ) was expressed in terms of general variables x i , ACT i and REP i . For these rows , they are hh i , EN i and CN i respectively . Clearly , ( 4 . 8 ) is zero when i equals three ( as hh 3 equals one for set 69 ) . For the other three rows , hh i is small and CN i is big - this combination also makes ( 4 . 8 ) negligibly small . Thus , for set 69 , Q =     R 2 0 S 2 0 T 2 0 U 2 V 2 W 2     83 where R 2 , S 2 , T 2 , U 2 , V 2 and W 2 are block matrices containing non - zero entries , whereas 0 denotes block matrices composed exclusively of zero entries . Eigenval - ues of Q can be found as a combination of those associated to block T 2 and Q 2 =  R 2 S 2 U 2 W 2  . Since T 2 is a diagonal ( four - sided square ) matrix , its associated eigenvalues are given by those entries which line its ( leading ) diagonal , i . e . each of the four eigenvalues associated to T 2 is given by the same λ , λ = − 1 H hh . Thus , we have also found four of the eigenvalues associated to J . The other ninety two are associated to our other block matrix Q 2 . 4 . 5 . 5 Rows 33 - 36 of Q 2 The thirty third to thirty sixth rows of Q 2 are taken from the forty ﬁrst to forty fourth to rows of J , which are given by the partial derivatives of ptc ’s ODEs . Note 4 . 5 . 3 Recall , ( 4 . 7 ) and ( 4 . 8 ) were expressed in terms of general variables x i , ACT i and REP i . For these rows , they are ptc i , CI i and CN i respectively . For i (cid:44) 3 , ptc i , CI i and CN i are big enough to make both ( 4 . 7 ) and ( 4 . 8 ) negligibly small . Thus , for set 69 , Q 2 =           D 0 0 0 E 0 F 0 0 0 0 0 − 1 H ptc 0 G 0 0 0 H 0 J K L M N           where D , E , F , G , H , J , K L , M and N are block matrices containing non - zero entries , whereas 0 denotes block matrices composed exclusively of zero entries . Eigenvalues of Q 2 can be found as a combination of those associated to blocks F , 84 H and Q 3 =  D 0 E 0 − 1 H ptc G J L N  . Since F and H are both diagonal ( square ) matrices , their associated eigenvalues are given by those entries which line their ( leading ) diagonals , i . e . each of the three eigenvalues associated to F and H is given by the same λ , λ = − 1 H ptc . Thus , we have also found three of the eigenvalues associated to J . The other eighty nine are associated to our other block matrix Q 3 . Note 4 . 5 . 4 With reference to ( 4 . 8 ) , we can see that the bracketed term is not only a fraction ( and therefore less than one ) but gets smaller as REP i does . Thus , ( 4 . 8 ) is small for all i 4 . 5 . 6 Rows 1 - 4 of Q 3 The ﬁrst to forth rows of Q 3 are taken from the ninth to twelfth rows of J , which are given by the partial derivatives of wg ’s ODEs . Note 4 . 5 . 5 Expressions ( 4 . 9 ) , ( 4 . 10 ) and ( 4 . 11 ) the non - zero ( o ﬀ - diagonal ) entries of these rows . From our previous chapter , we know that ( 4 . 12 ) ( equal to the CI / CN - wg link ) is negligibly small for all i , from which we infer that so too is ( 4 . 10 ) ( except perhaps for i = 3 , where CI i is small ) . Clearly , ( 4 . 13 ) ( equal to the IWG - wg link ) is small when IWG i is small under set 69 ( i (cid:44) 2 ) from which we infer that so too is ( 4 . 9 ) . And when i = 2 , although IWG i is not small , wg i is big and ( 4 . 13 ) is close to one , making ( 4 . 9 ) negligibly small . Thus , ( 4 . 9 ) is negligibly small , for all i . Finally , ( 4 . 11 ) is negligibly small ( for all i ) under set 69 since , not only is ( 4 . 12 ) small for all i , but ( 4 . 14 ) is small when CN is small and canceled out in ( 4 . 11 ) when CN i is big . 85 Thus , for set 69 , Q 3 =  F 2 0 0 0 0 − 1 H wg 0 G 2 0 0 H 2 0 K 2 L 2 M 2 N 2  where F 2 , G 2 , H 2 , K 2 L 2 , M 2 and N 2 are block matrices containing non - zero entries , whereas 0 denotes block matrices composed exclusively of zero entries . Eigen - values of Q 3 can be found as a combination of those associated to blocks F 2 , H 2 and Q 4 =  − 1 H wg G 2 L 2 N 2  . Since F 2 and H 2 are both diagonal ( square ) matrices , their associated eigenvalues are given by those entries which line their ( leading ) diagonals , i . e . each of the three eigenvalues associated to F 2 and H 2 is given by the same λ , λ = − 1 H wg . Thus , we have also found three of the eigenvalues associated to J . The other eighty six are associated to our other block matrix Q 4 . 4 . 5 . 7 Rows 59 - 62 of Q 4 The ﬁfty ninth to sixty second rows of Q 4 are taken from the seventy seventh to eightieth rows of J , which are given by the partial derivatives of CN ’s ODEs . For set 69 , Q 4 =       D 3 0 E 3 F 3 G 3 0 H 3 0 J 3       where D 3 , E 3 , F 3 , G 3 , H 3 and J 3 are block matrices containing non - zero entries , whereas 0 denotes a block matrix composed exclusively of zero entries . Eigenval - ues of Q 4 can be found as a combination of those associated to block G 3 and Q 5 =  D 3 E 3 H 3 J 3  . 86 Since G 3 is a diagonal ( four - sided square ) matrix , its associated eigenvalues are given by those entries which line its ( leading ) diagonal , i . e . each of the four eigenvalues associated to G 3 is given by the same λ , λ = − 1 H CN . Thus , we have also found four of the eigenvalues associated to J . The other eighty two are associated to our other block matrix Q 5 . 4 . 5 . 8 Rows 55 - 58 of Q 5 The ﬁfty ﬁfth to ﬁfty eighth rows of Q 5 are taken from the seventy third to seventy sixth rows of J , which are given by the partial derivatives of CI ’s ODEs . Note 4 . 5 . 6 Derivatives of CI 3 with respect to PTC 3 , j ( which can be found in an Appendix ) depend largely on CI 3 , which is small under set 69 . Thus , these derivatives are negligibly small . For set 69 , Q 5 =  D 4 0 E 4 0 F 4 G 4 H 4 0 0 0 0 0 K 4 0 0 L 4 0 0 M 4 0 N 4 0 0 0 P 4  where D 4 , E 4 , F 4 , G 4 , H 4 , K 4 , L 4 , M 4 , N 4 and P 4 are block matrices containing non - zero entries , whereas 0 denotes a block matrix composed exclusively of zero entries . Eigenvalues of Q 5 can be found as a combination of those associated to blocks H 4 , K 4 , M 4 and Q 6 =    D 4 F 4 N 4 P 4    . Since H 4 , K 4 and M 4 are all diagonal ( square ) matrices , their associated eigenvalues are given by those entries which line their ( leading ) diagonals , i . e . each of the four 87 eigenvalues associated to H 4 , K 4 and M 4 is given by the same λ , λ = − 1 H CI − C CI PTC ν PTCCI i , T κ ν PTCCI PTCCI + PTC ν PTCCI i , T . Thus , we have also found four of the eigenvalues associated to J . The other seventy eight are associated to our other block matrix Q 6 . 4 . 5 . 9 Rows 1 & 30 of Q 6 The ﬁrst and thirtieth rows of Q 6 are taken from the eleventh and forty third rows of J respectively , which are given by the partial derivatives of wg 3 ’s and ptc 3 ’s ODEs respectively . For set 69 , Q 6 =   D 5 0 0 0 0 E 5 F 5 0 0 0 0 0 G 5 0 0 0 0 H 5 J 5 K 5 0 0 0 L 5 M 5  where D 5 , E 5 , F 5 , G 5 , H 5 , J 5 , K 5 , L 5 , and M 5 are block matrices containing non - zero entries , whereas 0 denotes a block matrix composed exclusively of zero entries . Eigenvalues of Q 6 can be found as a combination of those associated to blocks D 5 , G 5 and Q 7 =    F 5 0 0 0 J 5 K 5 0 L 5 M 5    . Since D 5 and G 5 are both diagonal ( square ) matrices , their associated eigenvalues are given by those entries which line their ( leading ) diagonals , i . e . the eigenvalues associated to D 5 and G 5 are given by , λ = − 1 H wg & λ = − 1 H ptc respectively . Thus , we have also found two of the eigenvalues associated to J . The other seventy six are associated to our other block matrix Q 7 . In turn , eigenvalues 88 of Q 7 can be found as a combination of those associated to blocks F 5 and Q 8 =  J 5 K 5 L 5 M 5  . Let us brieﬂy summarise our ﬁndings thus far . Summary 4 . 5 . 1 All ﬁfty six eigenvalues found thus far depend on half - lives ( four were also dependent on PTC and three other parameters ) . It is clear that stability of our steady state ( for set 69 ) increases with the rate at which nodes decay . Thus , it appears that , although half - lives generally do not inﬂuence the location of a steady state , they greatly inﬂuence the stability of striped solutions in von Dassow’s SPN . With hindsight , this is perhaps unsurprising ( but reassuring nonetheless ) . 4 . 5 . 10 Rows 1 - 28 of F 5 The ﬁrst to twenty eighth rows of F 5 are taken from the thirteenth to fortieth rows of J , which are given by the partial derivatives of IWG ’s and EWG ’s ODEs . We could ﬁnd no simple structure here , even under set 69 . Using Maple , we were able to calculate its associated eigenvalues , most of which have highly complicated expressions . The following eleven are amongst the least complicated , λ = b + e + f λ = b − e − f λ = b − 2 e − f λ = b + e − f ( twice ) λ = b − e + f ( twice ) λ = e 2 + b ± 1 2 (cid:113) (cid:0) 3 e − 2 f (cid:1) 2 + 8 e f λ = e + f 2 + b 2 + a 2 ± 1 2 (cid:113)(cid:0) 2 e + b + f − a (cid:1) 2 + 24 cd where a , b , c , d , e and f are equal to the right hand sides of ( 10 . 9 ) , ( 10 . 12 ) , ( 10 . 8 ) , ( 10 . 11 ) , ( 10 . 14 ) and ( 10 . 13 ) respectively ( which can be found in our appendices ) . 89 Note 4 . 5 . 7 Terms a and b are negative , whilst c , d , e and f are positive . Expressions within the square roots are positive . All eleven of these eigenvalues are real . Six further ( more complicated ) eigenvalues associated to F 5 are reported in one of our appendices . Thus , we have also found twenty eight of the eigenvalues associated to J ( seventeen of which were su ﬃ ciently simple to report ) . The other forty eight are associated to our other block matrix Q 8 . 4 . 5 . 11 Rows 25 - 48 of Q 8 The twenty ﬁfth to forty eighth rows of Q 8 are taken from the eighty ﬁfth to one hundred and eighth rows of J , which are given by the partial derivatives of HH ’s ODEs . Note 4 . 5 . 8 All non - zero entries contained in block L 5 of Q 8 take the same form , k PTCHH [ PTC ] 0 HH i , j . For i (cid:44) 3 , these entries are negligibly small . Thus , for set 69 , Q 8 =   D 6 E 6 F 6 G 6 H 6 0 K 6 0 0 0 0 0 L 6 0 0 J 6 0 0 M 6 0 0 0 0 0 N 6   where D 6 , E 6 , F 6 , G 6 , H 6 , J 6 , K 6 , L 6 , M 6 and N 6 are block matrices containing non - zero entries , whereas 0 denotes a block matrix composed exclusively of zero entries . Eigenvalues of Q 8 can be found as a combination of those associated to blocks K 6 , L 6 , N 6 and Q 9 =     D 6 G 6 J 6 M 6     . 90 Since K 6 , L 6 and N 6 share the same general structure ,  s 1 v 0 0 0 v v s 2 v 0 0 0 0 v s 3 v 0 0 0 0 v s 4 v 0 0 0 0 v s 5 v v 0 0 0 v s 6  ( 4 . 15 ) so too will their eigenvalues . Note 4 . 5 . 9 Here , s i < 0 , i ∈ [ 1 , 6 ] , and v > 0 are equal to the right hand sides of ( 10 . 4 ) and ( 10 . 5 ) respectively ( which can be found in our appendices ) where they are expressed in terms of general variables Y and Z . Here , Y and Z are HH and PTC respectively . Using Maple , we were able to calculate all eighteen eigenvalues associated to K 6 , L 6 and N 6 , all of which have highly complicated expressions ( we include , as an Appendix , a Maple ﬁle for their calculation ) . Thus , we have also found eighteen of the eigenvalues associated to J ( none of which were su ﬃ ciently simple to report ) . The other thirty are associated to our other block matrix Q 9 . 4 . 5 . 12 Rows 1 - 24 of Q 9 The ﬁrst to twenty forth rows of Q 9 are taken from the forty ﬁfth to sixty eighth rows of J , which are given by the partial derivatives of PTC ’s ODEs . For set 69 , Q 9 =            D 7 0 0 0 0 0 E 7 0 0 F 7 0 0 G 7 0 H 7 0 0 0 J 7 K 7 0 L 7 M 7 N 7 P 7           where D 7 , E 7 , F 7 , G 7 , H 7 , J 7 , K 7 , L 7 , M 7 , N 7 and P 7 are block matrices containing non - zero entries , whereas 0 denotes a block matrix composed exclusively of zero 91 entries . Eigenvalues of Q 9 can be found as a combination of those associated to blocks D 7 and Q 10 =  E 7 0 0 F 7 0 G 7 0 H 7 0 0 J 7 K 7 L 7 M 7 N 7 P 7  . Block D 7 has the same structure as ( 4 . 15 ) . Note 4 . 5 . 10 Here , s i < 0 , i ∈ [ 1 , 6 ] , and v > 0 are equal to the right hand sides of ( 10 . 4 ) and ( 10 . 5 ) respectively ( which can be found in our appendices ) where they are expressed in terms of general variables Y and Z . Here , Y and Z are PTC and HH respectively . In D 7 , the s i terms are indistinguishable ( because all HH are negligibly small ) so we rename them all ’ s ’ . Using Maple , we ﬁnd its associated eigenvalues , λ ≈ s + 2 v = − H − 1 PTC λ ≈ s − 2 v = − H − 1 PTC − 4 r LMxferPTC λ ≈ s + v = − H − 1 PTC − r LMxferPTC ( twice ) λ ≈ s − v = − H − 1 PTC − 3 r LMxferPTC ( twice ) . Thus , we have also found six of the eigenvalues associated to J . The other twenty four are associated to our other block matrix Q 10 . We are unable to report expres - sions for these eigenvalues . 4 . 6 Block structure of J Stability of a steady state in a high dimensional system can be assessed . In this chapter , we have shown that our tool for measuring stability ( the Jacobian , J ) largely reduces to a block - like structure of diagonal sub - Jacobians ( miniature easy - to - do eigenvalue problems ) under set 69 . Note 4 . 6 . 1 von Dassow’s SPN is not highly connected , so J is sparse ( most of its entries are zero ) even before we reduce it . However , it is not su ﬃ ciently sparse to have a block structure . 92 Why does J reduce to this block structure ? Under set 69 , most nodes and many links in von Dassow’s SPN reach near binary values over time , i . e . their concentrations become either very large ( near one ) or very low ( near zero ) . Note 4 . 6 . 2 With reference to the links , this coincides with the ﬁndings of our previous chapter ( see “Dose - Response curves” subsection ) . May our reader recall that many of the links in von Dassow’s SPN are described mathematically by ( Hill ) functions which are at rest when their value is binary . Many entries in J can be expressed as simple functions of steady - state variables , most of which contain an expression akin to , x ( x − 1 ) where x is some steady state variable ( see earlier ’Hidden simplicity in X ’ subsec - tion ) . Near binary x will make this expression close to zero , which increases the sparseness of J , culminating in the block - like structure of this chapter . We have explained why J has a block structure ( under set 69 ) and why this helps us to ﬁnd eigenvalues . Now we come to a higher question - is this block structure essential to stability ? 4 . 6 . 1 Decoupling creates independent sub - systems When we reduce the scale of a problem as we have done here ( converting one Jacobian into many sub - Jacobians ) it is easy to forget the original scale . How does a system with so many nodes joined by so many links allow for a stable steady state ? Note 4 . 6 . 3 In short , because there is an analogue between the block - like structure of J ( as it can be thought of as independent sub - Jacobians ) and the system ( von Dassow’s SPN ) to which it relates ( which can be thought equivalent to several smaller , independent sub - systems under set 69 ) . From a stability perspective , von Dassow’s network undergoes mass decoupling ( under set 69 ) , i . e . many of the network’s links have been broken . What is left 93 behind is the same high number of nodes with a much lower level of connection . In fact , it is so low that what was one connected system is now many unconnected systems ( see Fig . 4 . 2 ) . How do we gain our “stability perspective” ? 4 . 6 . 2 Stability perspective Let us think back to the outset of this chapter , J is a matrix whose non - zero en - tries reﬂect the presence of links in von Dassow’s SPN . Might we not think of this process in reverse ? Suppose we did not know what von Dassow’s SPN looked like ( in its network or “digraph” representation ) , but we did know the Jacobian , J , associated to von Dassow’s ODE representation of the SPN - we could construct a network representation of von Dassow’s SPN model using J . The dimension of J would tell us how many nodes there were and the location of its non - zero entries would tell us which nodes should be linked . And thus , we could infer von Dassow’s network from J . Figure 4 . 2 : von Dassow’s SPN under set 69 from a stability perspective in cell two ( left ) and in cells one , three and four of the four - cell segment ( right ) . But suppose that , instead , we tried to infer the network from J under set 69 ( with its block - like structure ) ? What would that network look like ? We consider that network to be von Dassow’s SPN under set 69 from a stability perspective . From 94 a stability perspective , von Dassow’s SPN ( under set 69 ) can be thought of as a collection of independent sub - graphs ( see Fig . 4 . 2 ) . May we emphasise that the Jacobian associated to Figure 4 . 2 would be the same as that for von Dassow’s SPN under set 69 . Hence the two systems are , in some sense , equivalent . 4 . 6 . 3 Discussion As Figure 4 . 2 shows , the architecture of von Dassow’s SPN is quite di ﬀ erent from a stability perspective . In the non - en / hh domain ( cells one , two and four of the SPN - segment ) we can see that there are three distinct sub - systems in every cell . In Note 4 . 6 . 2 , we drew attention to the SPN - links ( described by Hill functions in von Dassow’s ODEs ) whose behaviour could be represented by dose - response curves ( because they are at equilibrium when the system , as a whole , is ) . May our reader note in Figure 4 . 2 that none of these links ( CN - en , CN - wg , CN - hh , CN - ptc , IWG - wg and PTC - CI ) exist in von Dassow’s SPN , from a stability perspective . Without these links , there is a distinct wingless sub - system ( wg , IWG and EWG nodes ) as well as a distinct cubitus interruptus sub - system ( ci , CI and CN nodes ) . Thus , the high number of dimensions in von Dassow’s SPN are not inter - dependent under set 69 . Hence , set 69 does not so much produce a stable steady state of high dimensions ( which feels counter - intuitive ) as many stable steady states of low di - mensions ( which does not feel counter - intuitive ) . Earlier we asked whether the reduction of J to a block structure was essential to a big system’s capacity for stability . This block structure matches that of a Ja - cobian associated to a much simpler variant of von Dassow’s SPN ( see Fig . 4 . 2 ) in which there are many small , independent sub - systems . Stability in this context ( where there is no large - scale inter - dependency between variables ) does not feel counter - intuitive . 95 4 . 7 Conclusion Computational techniques can ﬁnd eigenvalues numerically ( and those associated to our Jacobian matrix under set 69 are given as an Appendix ) , but what do we learn ? Only the nature of stability , not on what that nature depends . These tech - niques can even sometimes ﬁnd eigenvalues analytically , but what do we learn ? Eigenvalues of complex systems tend to be so complicated that , again , we gain little insight into which parameters control how stable or otherwise a steady state is . But we show here that , by expressing Jacobian entries as simple functions of steady state variables , understanding of stability can be quite straightforward . Behind the complexity of J , there is an underlying simplicity . For set 69 , a large Jacobian has small , independent parts which we call sub - Jacobians . These sub - Jacobians present small , independent eigenvalue problems . Striped expression of the SPN’s mRNAs and proteins alone seems su ﬃ cient to reduce most of the system’s eigenvalues to a dependance on its half - lives and twelve other parameters ( the six “di ﬀ usion” rates , the three relating to PTC - HH binding and the three relating to PTC ’s cleavage of CI ) . It is interesting to note that all twelve of these “other” parameters relate only to nodes in von Dassow’s SPN capable of “movement” ( EWG , PTC and HH can di ﬀ use around faces of the cell ) . Of the nodes in von Dassow’s SPN , only PTC and HH contribute to the extent to which our steady state ( under set 69 ) is stable . We ﬁnd ninety seven of the system’s one hundred and thirty two eigenvalues ( eighteen of which can be found using Maple and are not shown ) . We stress that all eigenvalues for set 69 were negative , real values even if we cannot account for all of them analytically ( see Appendix ) . Therefore , von Dassow’s SPN can replicate characteristic asymmetry under set 69 as a stable steady state . Note 4 . 7 . 1 Our ﬁndings suggest that this stability peaks for high rates of decay , di ﬀ usion and cleavage . This makes sense ; the quicker everything happens , the sooner a state of true 96 equilibrium can be reached . How is this stability possible in such a big system ? The division of J into small independent block matrices can be thought to correspond to a division of the SPN model it represents . If a big system such as the SPN can be thought of as a culmination of un - connected small systems , stable behaviour therein no longer surprises us . We anticipate that this mass decoupling of big systems into small systems might be a general property of big systems where stable behaviour is seen . 4 . 7 . 1 Our next chapter We have proposed what makes the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry stable in von Dassow’s model . In our next chapter , we want to ﬁnd out what makes this char - acteristic asymmetry possible in the ﬁrst place . We want to test some of the ideas from our previous “First Impressions” chapter , but testing of von Dassow’s model is time - consuming . If only we had more examples of conditions which harbour the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry ( so far , we have only set 69 ) , we could perhaps identify common trends in associated parameters . Note 4 . 7 . 2 We will make use of the following notation throughout this work , z ∈ O (cid:16) 10 − 1 (cid:17) which we use to mean that some value z is of order 10 − 1 or , if you prefer , that z is between 0 . 1 and one ( inclusively and exclusively respectively ) . 97 Chapter 5 Our SPN 5 . 1 Introduction Asymmetric expression of key SP genes ( en , wg and hh ) enables a growing fruit ﬂy to develop its segments . But this characteristic asymmetry is conditional - why is it that some conditions ( parameter sets ) can replicate it in von Dassow’s SPN , where most cannot ? There must be common properties shared by “successful” internal environments . We produce a reduced model to speed our search for such success - ful parameter sets for the full model ( von Dassow’s SPN ) . As such , our reduced model ( which we shall refer to as “our SPN” hereafter ) must provide an e ﬀ ective screen on parameter sets . It is important therefore that our reduction be validated . We propose a simple method which we call “lift - ing” ( to make a somewhat crude reference to a process used in group theory ) for this validation . 5 . 1 . 1 Reducing von Dassow’s SPN Von Dassow’s SPN may be viewed as the connection of certain recurring structures within the network . Consider Figure 5 . 1 ( a ) , where ACT and REP are transcrip - tion factors , g is some mRNA and G is some protein ( g and G are products of the 98 same gene ) . This type of structure is seen in von Dassow’s SPN and , wherever G is the unique protein form of its gene , we propose that such structures can be “abridged” ( see Fig . 5 . 1 ( b ) ) . In this way , we “shorthand” translation ( the process by which mRNA g is used to make protein G ) . In network terms , this means that we “merge” nodes of type g with nodes of type G to form nodes of type g / G . If such structures are the building blocks of von Dassow’s SPN then we show that , by using smaller building blocks ( in the same number as their larger counter - parts ) a much simpler model results . In fact , we are able to reduce the number of nodes by over two thirds and the parameter - space by over a quarter . How does von Dassow’s SPN achieve the characteristic asymmetry so key to its function ? Either through its architecture or some restrictions on parameters . In reducing von Dassow’s SPN , we identify inessential parts of this puzzle ( eliminated parts cannot be the cause of characteristic asymmetry , as it is still seen in our reduced model ) . ACT REP g G g / G ACT REP ( b ) ( a ) Figure 5 . 1 : Standard structures found in ( a ) von Dassow’s SPN & ( b ) our SPN . 5 . 1 . 2 Distribution of successful parameters As reported in [ 1 ] , von Dassow’s SPN can replicate the simultaneous wild - type expression of key SP genes en , wg and hh in most regions of parameter - space ( this was called robustness ) . We would like to know whether these “good” regions are numerous and evenly distributed throughout parameter space , as in Figure 5 . 2 ( a ) , or few but large as in Figure 5 . 2 ( b ) ( either way , this could be termed robust ) . In this chapter , we ﬁnd successful parameter sets distributed throughout most parts of parameter space . However , amongst these successful parameter sets we 99 ﬁnd , distribution of one parameter , κ CIwg , covers only two thirds of its range . If this were typical , one third of all parameter sets would fail to replicate the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry . ( a ) ( b ) Figure 5 . 2 : Two possible interpretations of robustness - Shaded regions represent location of successful parameter sets which are ( a ) evenly distributed throughout parameter space or ( b ) highly concentrated into a few large regions . The parameter - space is represented by the large unshaded circle in both ( a ) and ( b ) . 5 . 1 . 3 Work of others There were two pieces of particular importance from which we draw combined inspiration . Firstly in [ 8 ] , Ma et al . propose an SPN model which can be reduced to a core topology ( a three - node network ) . This allows a more comprehensive analysis whilst preserving key properties . They use a single node for en , EN , hh and HH which they justify by suggesting that hh expression is dependent on EN alone and we borrow this idea . Secondly , the work of Golubitsky and Stewart [ 28 ] , [ 15 ] in an area known as quotient networks . The underlying principle is that one can sometimes derive , from a network , a smaller “quotient” network . If nodes of the larger network are judged “the same” ( for reasons of synchrony , & c . ) they are replaced by single , rep - resentative nodes in the quotient network . Thus , the quotient network is a reduced model whose behaviour echoes that of the original network , but on a smaller , more manageable scale . A solution of the quotient gives a synchronous solution of the original network . 100 5 . 2 Merging nodes of von Dassow’s SPN Figure 5 . 3 : Full model : von Dassow’s SPN . Each cell in von Dassow’s SPN ( see Fig . 5 . 3 ) contains thirty three nodes ( ex - cluding dummy node B ) . By merging some of these nodes , we can reduce this to ten ( see Fig . 5 . 4 ) . Our reduced model has a combined total of just forty nodes in its four cells - less than a third of the respective size of von Dassow’s . This allows us to make swifter parameter surveys . We merge nodes whenever there is evidence to suggest that doing so would not a ﬀ ect the nature of expression of key SP genes ( en , wg and hh ) . Von Dassow’s SPN contains ﬁve genes , of which three have only an mRNA and a single protein form ( engrailed , hedgehog and patched ) . We suggest that these three are the best candidates for merging the mRNA and protein forms of the gene . 5 . 2 . 1 Merging 1 : Engrailed Products of the engrailed gene ( en and EN ) have equal steady state values in von Dassow’s SPN . Note 5 . 2 . 1 May our reader recall the ODE for EN i in von Dassow’s SPN , dEN i d τ = T 0 H EN ( en i − EN i ) . 101 Figure 5 . 4 : Our SPN , where en = en / EN / hh / HH and ptc = ptc / PTC . Hence , we “merge” the en and EN nodes of von Dassow’s SPN to make new en / EN nodes in our SPN . But which ODEs do we use for our en / EN node ? Since it is en which drives EN in von Dassow’s SPN , we use the same ODEs which governed en in von Dassow’s SPN to govern en / EN in our SPN . Wherever EN appears in von Dassow’s SPN , e . g . in the ODEs of ci , we use en / EN in its stead . Note 5 . 2 . 2 We call the en / EN node of our SPN ( see Fig . 5 . 4 ) en for convenience ( en will ultimately denote en / EN / hh / HH , we have not yet come to this ) . 5 . 2 . 2 Merging 2 : Hedgehog We merge also , the hedgehog nodes of von Dassow’s SPN ( i . e . hh and HH ) to make a new hh / HH node in our SPN . In justiﬁcation , let us consider von Dassow’s ODE for HH i , j at steady state , 0 = (cid:32) hh i 6 − HH i , j (cid:33) − H HH k PTCHH [ PTC ] 0 PTC n , j + 3 HH i , j + H HH r LMxferHH (cid:16) HH i , lr − 2 HH i , j (cid:17) and we wish to show that , perhaps with some restriction on parameters , an ap - proximation of hh i ≈ HH i , T can be made . This equation holds for any i and all j ∈ [ 1 , 6 ] , so we can add all six such equations ; for some i and j = 1 . . . 6 . We do so , obtaining , 0 = (cid:0) hh i − HH i , T (cid:1) − H HH k PTCHH [ PTC ] 0 6 (cid:88) j = 1 PTC n , j + 3 HH i , j + H HH r LMxferHH (cid:0) 2 HH i , T − 2 HH i , T (cid:1) 102 which simpliﬁes , HH i , T = hh i − H HH k PTCHH [ PTC ] 0 6 (cid:88) j = 1 PTC n , j + 3 HH i , j . ( 5 . 1 ) From this result , two things become clear - ﬁrstly , that HH i , T ≤ hh i at steady state and secondly that , except when the last term in ( 5 . 1 ) has a value of any signiﬁcance ( the sum term itself cannot exceed one sixth ) we indeed have our desired approxi - mation . However , the coe ﬃ cient of our sum term can take values between 5 × 10 − 2 and 10 5 , so the values of hh i and HH i , T are not always approximately equal . But is this a problem ? In justifying the merging of hh and HH , it is enough that , for some values , hh ≈ HH , though the region of parameter - space in which this is the case is restricted . However , it is not necessarily restrictive , i . e . just because the value of the hh / HH node in our SPN may not equal that of HH i , T in von Dassow’s ( for the same set of parameters ) does not , as a rule , a ﬀ ect the nature of a solution . Note 5 . 2 . 3 Whether the value of HH i , T in von Dassow’s SPN equals that of hh / HH in our SPN ( for the same parameters ) does not a ﬀ ect values of key SP genes en , hh and wg . As such , we regard it with little importance . Nevertheless , the value of HH i , T in von Dassow’s SPN will be small when the value of hh / HH in our SPN is small ( for the same parameters ) since HH ≤ hh at equilibrium ( see ( 5 . 1 ) ) . Where should we locate the hh / HH node in our SPN ? ( The hh and HH nodes are nuclear and membranous respectively ) . We decide on the nucleus because , from a reductionist perspective , it is more sensible and because it is the mRNA which “drives” the protein ( in von Dassow’s SPN ) and not vice versa . 5 . 2 . 3 Merging 3 : Patched In a similar way , we merge the patched nodes of von Dassow’s SPN ( i . e . ptc and PTC ) to make a new ptc / PTC node in our SPN . Von Dassow’s ODEs for PTC mirror 103 those of HH in structure and thus , we must obtain a mirror of ( 5 . 1 ) , PTC i , T = ptc i − H PTC k PTCHH [ HH ] 0 6 (cid:88) j = 1 HH n , j + 3 PTC i , j ( 5 . 2 ) from which it is clear that PTC i , T ≤ ptc i and that , when the ﬁnal term in ( 5 . 2 ) takes ( negligibly ) small values , we have the desired approximation of PTC i , T ≈ ptc i . For the same reasons outlined for hh / HH , we make our ptc / PTC nodes nuclear . Note 5 . 2 . 4 As both of our new nodes , hh / HH and ptc / PTC , are located in the nucleus of our SPN , we use for them the same ODEs which governed hh and ptc in von Dassow’s SPN . Wherever PTC i , T appears in von Dassow’s SPN , e . g . in the ODEs of CI , we use ptc / PTC in its stead . At the time of writing , we have found that ptc / PTC can take any of four modes of expressions within striped solutions . ptc / PTC =  ( ON , ON , ON , ON ) ( ON , ON , OFF , ON ) ( OFF , OFF , ON , OFF ) ( OFF , OFF , OFF , OFF ) Of these four , only ubiquitous expression made di ﬃ cult the successful translation of a striped solution in our SPN to one of von Dassow’s ( through lifting ) . This seems a logical consequence of ( 5 . 1 ) and ( 5 . 2 ) . Note 5 . 2 . 5 Since we make both ptc / PTC and hh / HH nodes nuclear in our SPN , there is no sense in which they take part in cell - to - cell communication through cell faces . As such , it seems illogical not to remove PH nodes from our SPN . 5 . 2 . 4 Merging 4 : Engrailed & Hedgehog We merge the engrailed ( en / EN ) and hedgehog ( hh / HH ) nodes of our SPN to make a new en / EN / hh / HH in our SPN . Both en / EN and hh / HH are repressed by CN , and , in addition , hh / HH is induced by en / EN . In this way , expression of 104 hh / HH is driven by that of en / EN in our SPN and , because of this , we use the same ODEs which governed en in von Dassow’s SPN to govern en / EN / hh / HH in our SPN . 5 . 2 . 5 Merging 5 : Extracellular Wingless 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 Cell 2 Cell 2 Cell 3 Cell 3 Cell 4 Cell 4 Cell 1 Cell 1 Cell 4 Cell 4 Cell 1 Cell 1 Figure 5 . 5 : Numbering of cells and cell faces in grid of four cell - wide , one - cell high segments in our SPN . Cell - to - cell communication occurs exclusively via EWG nodes ( see Appendix for ODEs in full ) . At steady state , there exists a horizontal ﬂip symmetry in the ODEs which govern EWG ( in von Dassow’s SPN ) - only half of these ODEs were independent ( see Appendices for details and Maple proof ) . In every cell , for i ∈ [ 1 , 4 ] , EWG i , 1 = EWG i , 4 EWG i , 2 = EWG i , 3 EWG i , 5 = EWG i , 6 in von Dassow’s SPN . As EWG are the only remaining extracellular nodes in our re - duced model , we choose to enforce this symmetry in our SPN ( doing so necessarily reduces hexagonal cells to ( equilateral ) triangular - see Fig . 5 . 5 ) , i . e . we merge the symmetric EWG nodes of each of von Dassow’s cells . Let ∆ 1 = EWG 1 , 1 = EWG 1 , 4 , ∆ 2 = EWG 1 , 2 = EWG 1 , 3 , ∆ 3 = EWG 1 , 5 = EWG 1 , 6 , . . . , ∆ 12 = EWG 4 , 5 = EWG 4 , 6 . Enforcing this symmetry gives us twelve independent ODEs for EWG , where 105 A = r ExoWG 6 , B = r MxferWG , C = r LMxferWG and D = r EndoWG + r MxferWG + 2 r LMxferWG + 1 H EWG ( see equations ( 5 . 3 - 5 . 14 ) ) . In our SPN , we use almost identical ODEs ( to ( 5 . 3 - 5 . 14 ) ) for EWG , except that the value of A is now doubled ( since the numerator of A represents the number of cell faces in von Dassow’s SPN ) . In our SPN , we let ∆ 1 = EWG 1 , 1 , ∆ 2 = EWG 1 , 2 , ∆ = EWG 1 , 3 , . . . , ∆ 12 = EWG 4 , 3 and the layout plus tiling of this new three - sided four - cell system is demonstrated in Figure 5 . 5 . Although we change the cells’ shape , EWG - communication ( between neighbouring cells and cell - faces ) is pre - served because we do not otherwise alter ODEs used . d ∆ 1 d τ = AIWG 1 + B ∆ 1 + C ( ∆ 2 + ∆ 3 ) − D ∆ 1 ( 5 . 3 ) d ∆ 2 d τ = AIWG 1 + B ∆ 6 + C ( ∆ 1 + ∆ 2 ) − D ∆ 2 ( 5 . 4 ) d ∆ 3 d τ = AIWG 1 + B ∆ 11 + C ( ∆ 1 + ∆ 3 ) − D ∆ 3 ( 5 . 5 ) d ∆ 4 d τ = AIWG 2 + B ∆ 4 + C ( ∆ 5 + ∆ 6 ) − D ∆ 4 ( 5 . 6 ) d ∆ 5 d τ = AIWG 2 + B ∆ 9 + C ( ∆ 4 + ∆ 5 ) − D ∆ 5 ( 5 . 7 ) d ∆ 6 d τ = AIWG 2 + B ∆ 2 + C ( ∆ 4 + ∆ 6 ) − D ∆ 6 ( 5 . 8 ) d ∆ 7 d τ = AIWG 3 + B ∆ 7 + C ( ∆ 8 + ∆ 9 ) − D ∆ 7 ( 5 . 9 ) d ∆ 8 d τ = AIWG 3 + B ∆ 12 + C ( ∆ 7 + ∆ 8 ) − D ∆ 8 ( 5 . 10 ) d ∆ 9 d τ = AIWG 3 + B ∆ 5 + C ( ∆ 7 + ∆ 9 ) − D ∆ 9 ( 5 . 11 ) d ∆ 10 d τ = AIWG 4 + B ∆ 10 + C ( ∆ 11 + ∆ 12 ) − D ∆ 10 ( 5 . 12 ) d ∆ 11 d τ = AIWG 4 + B ∆ 3 + C ( ∆ 10 + ∆ 11 ) − D ∆ 11 ( 5 . 13 ) d ∆ 12 d τ = AIWG 4 + B ∆ 8 + C ( ∆ 10 + ∆ 12 ) − D ∆ 12 ( 5 . 14 ) 5 . 2 . 6 Our SPN : Some details of ODEs We do not change the names of any parameters as we do not wish to lose the sense of connection between ours and von Dassow’s work - without this , our work is 106 irrelevant . So , for instance , in our SPN , a parameter such as κ ENci represents the connection between the en / EN / hh / HH node ( as apposed to EN ) and ci , but we leave its name unchanged . Note 5 . 2 . 6 The ODEs associated to our SPN are given in full , together with a full list of parameters and their meanings , in Appendix 10 . 8 .

For convenience , we should like to reduce von Dassow’s SPN still further , so why don’t we ? With reference to the cubitus interruptus nodes , it is clear that di ﬀ erent forms of its protein perform very di ﬀ erent roles , i . e . CI and CN are agents of induction and repression respectively , often with a common target gene . Thus , merging the two would be both biologically unrepresentative and mathematically clumsy ( in terms of the resulting ODEs ) . Note 5 . 2 . 7 Furthermore , in von Dassow’s SPN , CI and CN often di ﬀ er greatly in value ( as under set 69 , for example ) as CN is scaled by CI . As such , merging CI and CN nodes could increase the likelihood that a striped solution of our SPN were not preserved in von Dassow’s . However , could we merge ci with either CI or CN ? Not easily . As we have seen in set 69 , values of our three cubitus interruptus nodes can vary substantially . Al - though those of ci and CN were not hugely di ﬀ erent , merging nodes which are not directly connected is computationally awkward . It is tempting to merge wg and IWG , but this would leave EWG dependent on a cytosis movement , otherwise absent in the system . Again , this would be both biologically and mathematically clumsy . We do not merge wg and EWG because they are not directly linked , nor IWG and EWG because the issue of cytosis remains . We could merge wg , IWG and EWG but their values can vary and this could create a wide berth between behaviour of our SPN and von Dassow’s . Let us summarise this section . Summary 5 . 2 . 1 We reduce a high dimensional system by more than two thirds and its associated parameter - space by more than a quarter , all of which produces a run time ( on Matlab ) that is at most a tenth of its larger counter part . We hope that the methods applied in said reduction can be established for general usage in large systems . 108 Essentially , we look to reduce the number of nodes in the network ( and if we succeed , the reduction in parameter - space follows automatically ) . However , we do not wish to “lose” nodes , as it were , only group together when equations justify so doing . We ﬁnd four such reasons to merge nodes and , usually , merged nodes are products of the same gene , i . e . mRNA and protein . Firstly , we would merge nodes if their steady state values were equal ( as is the case for the engrailed nodes in von Dassow’s SPN ) . Secondly , a similar idea , we merge nodes with the same steady state value , but for some di ﬀ erence which could potentially , and realistically , be negligible ( as is the case for both the patched and hedgehog nodes in von Dassow’s SPN ) . The third reason applies to extracellular nodes only - if there exists an intrinsic symmetry within associated ODEs ( as is the case for EWG nodes in von Dassow’s SPN ) , then we can use one node to represent them , as they are in synchrony at steady state . Our fourth method may well be unique to von Dassow’s SPN . When a gene’s pattern of wild - type expression matches that of another upstream ( which induces it ) and their expression is repressed by the same protein ( as is the case for the hedgehog and engrailed genes in von Dassow’s SPN ) , we believe two such genes can be modeled as one . We believe that a direct link must exist between all nodes merged in these ways . Finally , we remove PH nodes altogether in our SPN . In von Dassow’s SPN , PH acts as a sink for HH in which the rate of removal depends on the concentration of PTC on adjacent cells and , thus , it is one of the mechanisms through which adjacent cells commu - nicate . In our SPN , HH and PTC do not exist as extracellular nodes , nor do we use their associated ODEs , so PH loses meaning . Does our SPN’s behaviour reﬂect that of von Dassow’s ? The ﬁrst check we made was to substitute set 69 into our SPN ( ignoring those parameters redundant to our SPN ) to verify that it reproduced the characteristic asymmetry we saw in von Dassow’s SPN - it did . Thus , a striped solution of von Dassow’s SPN was also 109 found to be a striped solution of our SPN . Is the reverse procedure equally successful , i . e . would parameters which har - bour wild - type expression of key SP genes in our SPN also do so in von Dassow’s ? Unlike our ﬁrst check , our second requires a specialised method as we attempt to use a parameter set which , in the context of von Dassow’s full system , is “too small” or incomplete . We call this uncomplicated method lifting . 5 . 3 Lifting No fewer than fourteen of von Dassow’s parameters are made redundant by our model reduction , but these must be restored when we “lift” any sets of interest ( from our SPN ) up to the full system ( von Dassow’s SPN ) . Note 5 . 3 . 1 We want to show that a striped solution in our SPN is equivalent to a striped solution in von Dassow’s SPN , i . e . that the same conditions replicate wild - type expression of key SP genes en , wg and hh in both daughter and parent network . Having allowed von Dassow’s ODE for en equation to , in some sense , absorb those parameters associated with EN , hh and HH in our SPN , our ﬁrst step in lifting is to allow the half lives of these three nodes to assume that of en when they are restored ( equally the half life of PTC is made to assume that of ptc ) . Next , we allow all kappa and nu terms associated with hh to take the values of corresponding terms for en . In summary , we let ,               H EN = H HH = H hh = H en H PTC = H ptc ν ENhh = ν WGen ν CNhh = ν CNen κ ENhh = κ WGen κ CNhh = κ CNen 110 where the bold parameters are of the reduced system’s parameter set , i . e . the ones being lifted . Thus , eight of our fourteen discarded parameters are lifted in a sensible way , leaving six unanswered for . Though not ideal , we allow these six to take values chosen at random . Nevertheless , it is believed that the behaviour of any parameter set which harbours characteristic asymmetry in our SPN can be matched by the full system for some , if not all , randomly chosen values of these six parameters . 5 . 4 Striped solutions In the tables which follow are some examples of parameter sets which not only produced wild - type expression of en / EN / hh / HH and wg in our SPN , but also of key SP genes en , wg and hh in von Dassow’s SPN ( after lifting , when all nodes were restored , or separated if you will ) . In Figure 5 . 6 , we plot the values of κ parameters from these tables ( plots for other parameters are included as appendices ) . 111 Parameter Sol’n 1 Sol’n 2 Sol’n 3 Sol’n 4 Sol’n 5 Sol’n 6 Sol’n 7

from which we might identify trends in parameter distribution . Only four of the half - lives appear in the steady state equations ( they being those of CI , CN , IWG and EWG ) . As such , we did not expect , nor do we notice , any trends amongst half - life 115 Figure 5 . 6 : From left to right , columns represent the parameters κ WGen , κ CNen , κ WGwg , κ CIwg , κ CNwg , κ CIptc , κ CNptc , κ Bci , κ ENci and κ PTCCI respectively . All κ parameter values were sampled uniformly in log over the range 0 . 001 to 1 . 0 , so we use a logarithmic scale here for the vertical axis . May our reader note that plots of a similar ilk for other parameters can be found as an Appendix . distribution here . Instead , we hoped some of the κ and ν terms may show some limitation . Note 5 . 4 . 1 Our reader may recall that , in our “First impressions” chapter , we drew attention to the CI / CN - wg link in von Dassow’s SPN and what we felt to be an intrinsic need for its ubiquitous smallness . Of the ﬁve parameters relating to the CI / CN - wg link ; the distribution ( in our tables ) of one in particular - κ CIwg ( potency of CI ’s induction of wg ) - stands out ( see Fig . 5 . 6 ) . Its value is always greater than 0 . 01 . This parameter can take any value between 0 . 001 and one , i . e . it is randomly selected over three orders of magnitude and yet , here we ﬁnd that it is exclusive to only two . On this evidence , an average of one out of every three generated κ CIwg would not be part of a striped solution . In consequence , an average of one out of every three parameter sets will fail to replicate characteristic asymmetry in our SPN . Note 5 . 4 . 2 On this evidence , one third of all internal environments would lead to abnormal development and one third of all fruit ﬂies would be at a disadvantage in its ﬁght for survival . 116 Furthermore , there are only two cases here of κ CIwg falling below 0 . 1 and , in both cases , the value of ν CIwg ( cooperativity of CI ’s induction of wg , which can take values between one and ten ) is below two . This would seem to indicate that , when κ CIwg is raised to the power ν CIwg in the ODEs associated to our reduced SPN model ( given in full as an appendix ) , that value too must be relatively large . Indeed , we ﬁnd that all such values ( which range between 10 − 30 and one , in theory ) are above 0 . 0008 . On this evidence , weak CI - induction of wg supports the natural function of the SPN . A lesser trend also emerges from our data ; the value of κ CNen with exponent ν CNen ( which range between 10 − 30 and one , in theory ) is always less than 0 . 001 here . This suggests that CN ’s repression of en cannot be weak here . Why might this be ? Per - haps it is due to the nature of en expression and that of its regulators . Wild - type en expression is symmetric about the third cell , as is that of one of its regulators , CN . However , wild - type expression of its other regulator , EWG ( from neighbouring cells ) , is symmetric about the second cell of the four - cell segment . For this reason , we propose that CN ’s regulation of en should dominate that of EWG . Note 5 . 4 . 3 For set 69 , the value of κ ν CNen CNen was 0 . 0023 ( a little higher than observed here ) but our points remain . 5 . 4 . 2 Findings : Ours & von Dassow’s In [ 3 ] , von Dassow et al . plot the distribution of individual parameters amongst striped solutions . We summarise their most notable ﬁndings here ( those for which there was an obvious bias either to low or high values of a parameter ) . They found , • signiﬁcantly fewer striped solutions associated to higher values of κ CNen - an impotent repression of en by CN did not lend itself as well to striped solutions ( as its potent counterpart ) . • signiﬁcantly fewer striped solutions associated to lower values of κ CIwg - a 117 potent induction of wg by CI did not lend itself as well to striped solutions ( as its impotent counterpart ) . • signiﬁcantly fewer striped solutions associated to higher values of κ CNwg - an impotent repression of wg by CN did not lend itself as well to striped solutions ( as its potent counterpart ) . • signiﬁcantly fewer striped solutions associated to higher values of κ CIptc - an impotent induction of ptc by CI did not lend itself as well to striped solutions ( as its potent counterpart ) . • signiﬁcantly fewer striped solutions associated to lower values of κ CNptc - a potent repression of ptc by CN did not lend itself as well to striped solutions ( as its impotent counterpart ) . • signiﬁcantly fewer striped solutions associated to higher values of κ PTCCI - an impotent cleavage of CI by PTC did not lend itself as well to striped solutions ( as its potent counterpart ) . • fewer striped solutions associated to lower values of r EndoWG and r ExoWG - higher rates of cytosis did not lend themselves as well to striped solutions ( as lower rates ) . and these are all reﬂected in our ﬁndings ( see tables ) , though we did not see quite such an obvious bias in the cases of κ CIptc and κ PTCCI . Note 5 . 4 . 4 We found the opposite trend to von Dassow et al . on r MxferWG ( rate of inter - cell di ﬀ usion of EWG ) - they found that higher rates did not lend themselves as well to striped solutions as lower rates . But this does not concern us greatly as our sample is very much smaller than that of von Dassow et al . 5 . 4 . 3 Restrictions of our SPN In the derivation of our reduced SPN model , we have made no attempt to gain some greater intrinsic bias to any particular sort of gene expression . For example , 118 we do not believe that to combine the ptc and PTC nodes in our reduced model re - stricts the possibilities of a parameter set in the full model ( after lifting ) . However , our SPN is not without restriction . For example , in lifting a parameter set from our SPN to von Dassow’s , we ﬁx the values of hh parameters ( those which appear in hh ’s ODEs ) to match those of en with the intention that , after lifting , expression of en and hh will match in von Das - sow’s SPN . Although uncommon , our parameter surveys of von Dassow’s SPN did reveal some cases of wild - type en with misexpressed hh ( i . e . hh - expression which is not wild - type ) under the same parameter set . But then , this could be seen as an advantage , if it leads to an increased “hit rate” ( frequency of striped solutions ) in our SPN . 5 . 4 . 4 Our SPN compared to von Dassow’s In [ 1 ] , von Dassow et al . reported their SPN model robust to parameter variation - how does our SPN compare in this respect ? On average , we ﬁnd that about one out of ﬁfty randomly chosen parameter sets replicate characteristic asymmetry in our SPN . Note 5 . 4 . 5 In three short tests , each consisting of one hundred randomly generated ( un - ﬁltered ) parameter sets , our SPN found one , three and two striped solutions respectively . On average , a random choice of parameter in our SPN ( which has thirty four parameters in all ) has chance X of being compatible with its characteristic behaviour where , X 34 = 1 50 = ⇒ X = (cid:18) 1 50 (cid:19) 134 = ⇒ X = 0 . 8913 which is a little less than von Dassow found ( he found 0 . 9232 ) but a little more than we found in our testing of his model ( we found 0 . 8796 ) . Either way , we be - lieve our SPN has inherited the robustness of von Dassow’s - does it inherit other properties ? What about the most frequently seen behaviour in our SPN ? Does our 119 SPN accurately reproduce proportions of common behaviour seen in our testing of von Dassow’s SPN ? When testing von Dassow’s SPN , there were two prominent outcomes - most seen was the ubiquitous expression of all key SP genes ( en , wg and hh ) . Almost equally prominent was the wild - type expression of en and hh , coupled by the ubiquitous expression of wg . Do these two outcomes feature prominently in our SPN ? We did two sample runs of our SPN , each time with one hundred randomly generated parameter sets . The most prominent behaviour of von Dassow’s SPN ( in our testing - see previous “von Dassow’s SPN” chapter ) was seen ﬁfty one times in the ﬁrst run and forty three times in the second run of our SPN . The second most prominent was seen twenty three times in the ﬁrst and seventeen times in the second run of our SPN . en / EN / hh / HH wg Proportion 1 ( ON , ON , ON , ON ) ( ON , ON , ON , ON ) 47 % 2 ( OFF , OFF , ON , OFF ) ( ON , ON , ON , ON ) 20 % Thus , on average , the most prominent outcomes of von Dassow’s SPN were the most prominent outcomes of our SPN . In particular , we note that the second most prominent of von Dassow’s was also seen for twenty per - cent of the sample . But can we explain why ubiquitous expression of all key SP genes was seen so much more frequently in our SPN than in von Dassow’s ( more than twice as often ) ? Perhaps . May our reader recall that , when testing von Dassow’s SPN , we only used a time period of two hundred minutes whereas here , for our SPN , we used a time - period of one thousand minutes ( because running our model is so much quicker ) . Perhaps many parameter sets which did not cause ubiquitous expression of key SP genes within two hundred minutes ( for von Dassow’s SPN ) would have done so within one thousand . Perhaps two hundred minutes was simply not long enough for von Dassow’s SPN to reach a steady state ( under some parameters ) . 120 5 . 4 . 5 Is ptc the key to robustness ? Striped solutions replicate wild - type expression of all SP genes bar one , ptc . The ptc node takes a few di ﬀ erent modes of expression - is it this versatility which gives rise to the robustness of von Dassow’s SPN ? We suspect that striped solutions with the same mode of ptc expression come from a similar region of parameter - space . There could be some such region associated to each of the di ﬀ erent modes , thus spreading striped solutions throughout parameter - space . A discussion on this can be found as an Appendix - we summarise the main observations here . Summary 5 . 4 . 1 When ptc was either o ﬀ everywhere or had en - type expression as part of one of our striped solutions , we found that κ PTCCI (cid:60) O (cid:16) 10 − 1 (cid:17) , i . e . a third of κ PTCCI ’s range was “out of bounds” . On this evidence , one of three parameter sets would not be part of this kind of striped solution ( one with these modes of ptc expression ) . When ptc expression was en - type as part of a striped solution , we found that κ CIptc (cid:60) O (cid:16) 10 − 1 (cid:17) , i . e . a third of κ CIptc ’s range was out of bounds . Together with the previous paragraph’s restriction , on this evidence , ﬁve out of every nine parameter sets would not be part of this kind of striped solution . When ptc was on everywhere as part of a striped solution , we found that both κ CNptc (cid:60) O (cid:0) 10 − 3 (cid:1) and κ CIptc (cid:60) O (cid:16) 10 − 1 (cid:17) . On this evidence , ﬁve out of every nine parameter sets would not be part of this kind of striped solution . It is worth noting here that Ingham et al . found that ubiquitous expression of SP gene ptc made no di ﬀ erence to the survival rate of a fruit ﬂy in their 1991 work , [ 25 ] . Perhaps then , this ﬂexibility of ptc is not merely a quirk of a model and it is indeed that which makes the SPN so robust . 5 . 5 Conclusion An accusation of biologists often leveled at mathematicians is that our eagerness to reduce biological systems to their most basic form comes at a cost - that we simplify to the point whereby our resulting networks are no longer representative . Therefore , it is no small achievement that a “good candidate” is found ( in our case , 121 this means a system which accurately replicates the characteristic asymmetry of von Dassow’s SPN ) . Our system is so intrinsically linked to von Dassow’s that , for any striped solution , we can “get back” to the full system ( via lifting ) from a parameter set less than three quarters the size . Thus we have the best of both worlds - a more approachable system , which retains the detail of one much larger . We have justiﬁed our model by properties of von Dassow’s ODE system , but in truth , we derived our model from the outcome of von Dassow’s under set 69 ( see “Set 69” subsection in our “von Dassow’s SPN” chapter ) where many nodes took similar values , e . g . en and hh . The converse reality , then , is that , rather than von Dassow’s equations preempting our model , our model actually predicted the very features of those equations related as origins in this chapter . Once realised , we felt our model vindicated and this demonstration of prediction bodes well . Moreover , those parts of the system which haven’t lent themselves to reduction are suggestive as being the key interactions in determining or , more hopefully , pre - dicting the system’s behaviour . For example , we suppose that lifted parameters have a more generous “room for error” when it comes to maintaining what would otherwise be a striped solution , i . e . we believe them less likely to be “solution breakers” than their non - lifted counterparts . To summarise , we believe that the engrailed - hedgehog pathway can be abridged , whilst the translation process is generally unnecessary in a model , unless multiple protein forms exist therein . By removing so many luxurious connections , we saw a clearer picture and were able to spot easily two very distinctive trends in parameter distribution amongst those which replicated the wild - type expression of key SP genes en , wg and hh . We believe that these two trends represent possible keys to the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry . One trend relating to the κ CIwg parameter suggests that CI - induction 122 Figure 5 . 7 : SPN splits when its characteristic asymmetry is seen : Our SPN without EWG - en and CI / CN - wg links . of wg should be weak . The other , relating to the κ CNen parameter , suggests CN - repression of en should not be weak . The SPN’s characteristic asymmetry ( wild - type expression of key SP genes en , wg and hh ) could be described as the coexistence of two di ﬀ erent symmetries ( en and hh have wild - type expression symmetric about cell three , i . e . ( OFF , OFF , ON , OFF ) and wg has wild - type expression symmetric about cell two , i . e . ( OFF , ON , OFF , OFF ) ) . In this way , the symmetry of wild - type expression of key SP genes might be said to shift ( between cells two and three of the SPN segment ) . What makes it shift in this way ? We believe that the parameter trends seen in this chapter may tell us . That CI - induction of key SP gene wg should be weak suggests that a fruit ﬂy will develop abnormally when wg is overly up - regulated by CI . And , since CN - repression of wg is modeled by von Dassow et al . as a mediated process ( in which CN down - regulates CI - induction of wg - see Fig . 5 . 8 ) , it would appear that the natural function of the SPN is not supported by CI / CN - regulation of wg . That CN - repression of en should not be weak suggests that the natural function of the SPN cannot be supported in the absence of the CN - en link . Could we even go so far as suggest that the absence of the EWG - en link from the SPN would not interfere 123 with its natural function ( as the EWG - en link does not seem to show similar signs of necessity to the CN - en link ) ? Suppose EWG - regulation of en as well as CI / CN - regulation of wg were absent from our SPN - we would have two separate systems ( see Fig . 5 . 7 ) . Wingless nodes ( wg , IWG and EWG ) would not be connected to the rest of our SPN . The wingless nodes could have their own symmetry ( about the wg domain ) and the rest of the SPN could have its own symmetry ( about the en domain ) . This would explain our SPN’s characteristic asymmetry without the need for a spontaneous shift . wg CN CI Figure 5 . 8 : CN - repression of wg is mediated and would perhaps be better rep - resented in this form ( where CN represses CI - induction of wg , rather than wg directly ) . 5 . 5 . 1 Robustness : Bottom line May our reader recall that the robustness of their SPN model was celebrated by von Dassow et al . [ 1 ] . By this , they meant that its characteristic asymmetry was robust to variation in both ICs and parameters . Note 5 . 5 . 1 Characteristic asymmetry refers to the simultaneous wild - type expression of key SP genes ; engrailed ( en ) , wingless ( wg ) and hedgehog ( hh ) . As these modes of expression are symmetrical about di ﬀ erent cells ( cell two for wg and cell three for en and hh ) , we might think of the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry as the coexistence of multiple symmetries in one system . 124 This robustness was surprising ( and consequently worth celebration ) because mul - tiple symmetries within one system is unusual , so the fact that they saw it “ro - bustly” ( i . e . for parameters from lots of di ﬀ erent regions of parameter - space ) is extraordinary . However , in our conclusion we proposed that the SPN’s character - istic asymmetry is only made possible by a decoupling which splits the SPN into two distinct systems ( as shown in Fig . 5 . 7 ) . Figure 5 . 7 shows that key SP gene wg is part of one system , whilst key SP genes en and hh ( represented here by a single node , en ) are part of another system . Therefore , characteristic asymmetry is seen when the wild - type expression of wg ( symmetric about cell two ) is seen in one system , whilst the wild - type expression of en and hh ( symmetric about cell three ) is seen in another system . Thus , the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry does not maintain modes of expression with di ﬀ erent symmetries in one system , but in separate systems . With this in mind , robustness of the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry becomes far less surprising because the two di ﬀ erent symmetries found in the wild - type ex - pression patterns of key SP genes do not coexist within a single connected system , as formerly thought . As such , the robustness of characteristic asymmetry seems no more remarkable than that of other modes of expression in the SPN ( except that the robustness of characteristic asymmetry exists in spite of the restrictions it imposes on the system , e . g . in the CI / CN - wg link ) . Note 5 . 5 . 2 An example of another mode of expression within the SPN would be the ubiqui - tous expression of all key SP genes - see “Our SPN compared to von Dassow’s” subsection . And other modes , e . g . ubiquitous expression of all key SP genes , are far more robust than characteristic asymmetry - we’ve found that , in general , half of all parameter sets turn key SP genes on in all cells . Compared to this ubiquitous expression , characteristic asymmetry is not so robust . But as characteristic asym - metry seems to place restrictions on the network ( with the CI / CN - wg link absent or 125 “o ﬀ everywhere” if you prefer ) , this comparison is perhaps unsurprising . Never - theless , by these standards the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry could be described as relatively “un - robust” . 5 . 5 . 2 Our next chapter In our previous chapter we showed how the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry could be stable and here , we have shown how it is possible at all . In our next chapter , we confront the idea of its robustness raised by von Dassow et al . in [ 1 ] . What allows a system with so many possible outcomes to have one outcome robust to variation ? Or , conversely , what could prevent it ? Note 5 . 5 . 3 In future chapters , we will refer to our reduced model as “our SPN” ( the associated ODEs of which are given as an Appendix ) , our en / EN / hh / HH node as simply en and our ptc / PTC node as simply ptc . 126 Chapter 6 Stripes 6 . 1 Introduction In [ 1 ] , von Dassow et al . described the SPN as “robust” . The implication , almost , is one of universal functionality and this is unsatisfactory - a model should tell us something about the represented system . We might take one of two approaches - either we discover what makes it work or , what stops it working . If we are to understand a model’s output , we can but do so in terms of its input . Here , the inputs are understood to be parameters which , together with initial values , govern the SPN’s behaviour ( the output ) . It would not be unreasonable to suggest that a true understanding enables predic - tion and this is what we hope this chapter will achieve , i . e . a method which uses the input of our SPN to predict its output . There are two parts to our proposed method which , to a certain extent , are so inextricably linked that it is di ﬃ cult to speak of them in isolation . They are , however , each in need of some indepen - dent introduction , which follow , before we go into greater detail . Both focus on the intrinsic restrictions of any parameter set - the ﬁrst concentrates on the nodes themselves , whilst the second looks at the links between them . 127 6 . 1 . 1 Overview X f ( X ) κ ν Figure 6 . 1 : Level of regulator X against level of regulation f ( X ) = (cid:16) X ν κ ν + X ν (cid:17) . Redrawn from [ 1 ] , Figure 6 . 1 ( a dose - response ( D - R ) curve ) could be misleading - might not one infer from its labels that the tangent has slope ν ? But this is not the case , the tangent to this slope at its midpoint has gradient , d f ( X ) dX = ν 4 κ . Transcriptional activation and repression are modeled here , as usually , with Hill functions ( which can be described schematically by D - R curves , as in Figure 6 . 1 ) . The target expression pattern of the SPN involves certain genes being almost com - pletely silenced in some cell ( s ) , whilst being strongly , even maximally , expressed in some other cell ( s ) . These competing objectives place sharp restrictions on those chemical species which regulate gene expression in the SPN and so also on the pa - rameters which determine the equilibrium values of those concentrations as well as those associated to regulation they perform ( i . e . to Hill functions ) . By approximating the sloped section of a D - R curve ( see Fig . 6 . 1 ) to a triangle ( as in Figure 6 . 2 ) , we can calculate for any Hill function the concentration of X “big enough” to impose maximal regulation and “small enough” to impose minimal regulation . In Figure 6 . 2 , κ must be the midpoint of the triangle’s base because it corresponds to the midpoint of the height and so ∆ X is divided exactly in half by X = κ . Figure 6 . 2 shows that a value of X big enough to give f ( X ) ≈ 1 is , κ + 2 κ ν 128 whilst a value of X small enough to give f ( X ) ≈ 0 is , κ − 2 κ ν . Hence , parameter values restrict our SPN - is this the only type of restriction we can identify ? No , as we can show with a simple example . For our SPN at steady state , CN = H CN H CI ( ci − CI ) , where ci < 1 and CI < ci from which it is clear that CN < H CN H CI and this can be as small as 0 . 05 , a highly re - strictive maximum . So , using parameters alone , we have shown how to ﬁnd both precise concentrations of activity which must be achieved by the SPN’s regulators and , here , restrictions imposed upon the activity of those regulators .

Bottom : Half of ∆ X appears either side of X = κ . With knowledge of this kind , we can often predict abnormal development of a fruit ﬂy using only parameters in our SPN . We propose this has deep signiﬁcance , i . e . that our SPN’s initial conditions have no role in our predictions because it means that a fruit ﬂy’s current state cannot prevent abnormal growth under cer - tain conditions . In such cases , a fruit ﬂy’s development would “go wrong” no 129 matter how “well” ( or otherwise ) its development had gone up to the point when the “bad” conditions manifested . So what had been an “healthy” fruit ﬂy could quickly become “unhealthy” under a change in conditions . 6 . 2 Premiss A dose - response ( D - R ) curve depicts the capacity for regulation in some link ( be - tween two nodes - regulator and regulated ) in our SPN . Ideally , a D - R curve would have a steep slope , reﬂecting conditions where regulation of a target gene more easily switches between strong in some cell ( s ) and weak in others ( as then , a reg - ulator would not need such a high capacity of its own to impose the wild - type striped expression of SP genes ) . Note 6 . 2 . 1 In our previous chapter , we proposed that our SPN’s characteristic asymmetry ( the wild - type striped expression of key SP genes en and wg ) would exist only when CN dominated regulation of key SP gene en and when IWG dominated regulation of wg ( as the CI / CN based regulation was limited ) . Hence , the CN - en and IWG - wg links are , in some sense , the most signiﬁcant in our SPN ( and both can be represented by D - R curves ) . But even a regulator under these ideal conditions may not be able to perform its role successfully due to its own limited range of values . If there were some way of measuring these limitations - both those of regulation and regulator - we could use D - R curves to relate the two . We show that there is such a way , allowing us to identify those internal environments ( parameter sets ) which would hinder a fruit ﬂy’s development , using parameters alone . More generally , this could teach us how to identify the warning - signs of abnormal behaviour before it has a chance to materialise . Note 6 . 2 . 2 Ultimately , we show that , unless both the CN - en and IWG - wg links can be on in some cell ( s ) and o ﬀ in others , our SPN cannot achieve its characteristic asymmetry . 130 6 . 2 . 1 Nodes - Maxima & minima Key SP genes are ubiquitously expressed in our SPN for most parameter sets ( see “Our SPN compared to von Dassow’s” subsection in our previous chapter ) . Ex - pression which is either ubiquitous or ubiquitously absent might be described as “stripeless” as there are no stripes of expression ( a gene product has striped ex - pression if it is on in some cell ( s ) , o ﬀ in some other cell ( s ) in our SPN ) . Detecting parameter sets which cause stripeless expression of SP gene products would be a signiﬁcant step towards identifying potentially successful parameter sets ( by elimination ) . Each node in our SPN takes a theoretical , maximal range of values - for most nodes , this range is approximately , if not exactly , between zero and one . However , in reality , each parameter set has a unique set of nodal ranges associated to it . For example , if κ Bci were equal to one , ci ’s maximum could not exceed two sev - enths . This sets o ﬀ a chain of events , i . e . ci ’s reduced maximum e ﬀ ects a reduced maximum for CI and CN , & c . Thus , substituting parameter values and nodes’ the - oretical maximal ranges into our steady state equations reveals restrictions , unique to each parameter set . 6 . 2 . 2 Couplings - Dose - response curves A D - R curve graphs the behaviour of functions of type , f = (cid:18) X ν X ν + Y ν (cid:19) ν 2 ( 6 . 1 ) as Y ( when Y is some repressor ) or X ( when X is some inducer ) varies . These rep - resent the scope of coupling between regulators and their targets ( usually genes ) . A D - R curve ( see Figure 3 . 1 ) is conventionally thought to have three parts - two “horizontal” parts ( one high , one low ) joined by a smooth slope in the middle ( see Figure 6 . 3 ) . However , this is not always the case , as a D - R curve can be truncated . 131 In Figure 6 . 3 , we illustrate this idea of truncation , by highlighting an area ( boxed ) which might remain thereafter . A D - R curve represents all possible regulation levels ( associated to some coupling ) across the various cells of our SPN and yet , when truncated in the manner shown ( see Fig . 6 . 3 ) it is clear that the associated coupling produces only one level of regulation in all cells ( e . g . a low level of up - regulation , as in Figure 6 . 3 ) and such a coupling might be described as “stripeless” . Why might such a scenario be signiﬁcant ? Just because one coupling ( between regulator and target ) has no capacity for varied regulation does not , in itself , pre - vent striped expression of the target . Yet , for certain couplings in our SPN , it does - there exist scenarios whereby a single stripeless coupling ( one which takes the same value in all cells - as would be the case for a coupling represented by the right hand side of Figure 6 . 3 ) is su ﬃ cient to tell us that our SPN cannot replicate its characteristic asymmetry under the corresponding parameter . Let us be clear - though a single stripeless coupling may not , in itself , prevent wg ’s wild - type expression , nor indeed that of en , it can be enough to prevent their simultaneous wild - type expression . Figure 6 . 3 : A D - R curve in its theoretical entirety ( left ) and truncated ( right ) . 6 . 3 Toy model As we neared the conclusion of this chapter’s ﬁrst draft , it became increasingly apparent that the demands placed on the reader were unnecessarily great . A 132 Figure 6 . 4 : 2 - node toy model simple yet , we hope , demonstrative toy model is devised , to which we shall refer the reader , in summary of ideas or whenever involved methods are introduced . What is the toy model ? A model like our SPN , but with only two nodes in each cell and , rather than four cells repeated , suppose we had a two - cell tiling . The shape of the cell is unimportant as there are no extracellular nodes . For the sake of argument , let us stick to triangular . Figure 6 . 4 shows the inside of one such cell - we claim , for it , no biological signiﬁcance , but ask the reader to think of a and b as two genes with complimentary expression , each of which is inhibited by the other ( whilst J and K are dummy nodes ) . Aside 6 . 3 . 1 Here are our toy model’s ODEs , where i ∈ [ 1 , 2 ] is the cell number and parameters κ , ν and H have the same sense of meaning as previously , as do their subscripts . da i d τ = T 0 H a  J (cid:18) κ ν baba κ ν baba + b ν bai (cid:19) κ Ja + J (cid:18) κ ν baba κ ν baba + b ν bai (cid:19) − a i  & db i d τ = T 0 H b  K (cid:18) κ ν abab κ ν abab + a ν abi (cid:19) κ Kb + K (cid:18) κ ν abab κ ν abab + a ν abi (cid:19) − b i  Initial conditions of a and b mirror their “wild - type” behaviour , i . e . a = ( OFF , ON ) & b = ( ON , OFF ) where a ( τ = 0 ) = ( 0 . 001 , 0 . 6 ) & b ( τ = 0 ) = ( 0 . 6 , 0 . 001 ) and a parameter set shall be called a striped solution if expression of both a and b is wild - type after a period of one thousand minutes ( a gene x is considered to be ON if x ≥ 0 . 1 ) . Our dummy nodes both take the constant value of two ﬁfths . 133 6 . 4 Nodes - The circuit How do we calculate the restricted ranges of our SPN nodes for some parameter set ? Our SPN can be thought of as a circuit of nodes with en both the initial and ﬁnal node . Working our way around the nodes of this circuit , feeding parameter values into the associated ODEs ( see ( 10 . 19 - 10 . 27 ) ) at steady state , exposes the restricted ranges of nodes . To begin , we assume our initial node takes its theoretical maximal range . These en values ( a minimum of zero and a maximum of one ) are fed into ( 10 . 25 ) , the ODE associated second node of our circuit , ci . Thus we ﬁnd that ci ’s restricted range ( whose limit is ci ’s actual range ) to be [ ci min , ci max ] where , ci min = B (cid:18) κ ν ENciENci κ ν ENciENci + 1 (cid:19) κ Bci + B (cid:18) κ ν ENciENci κ ν ENciENci + 1 (cid:19) & ci max = B κ Bci + B . Aside 6 . 4 . 1 Given a node x , we use the subscripts ( or superscripts , where appropriate ) min / max to denote the restricted minimum / maximum of x ( or of its elements if x is a vector ) . The next node of our circuit is CI , whose minimum / maximum is given by minimal / maximal ci with maximal / minimal ptc - cleavage in ( 10 . 26 ) . Our third node’s restricted range is [ CI min , CI max ] where , CI min = ci min (cid:18) 1 + H CI C CI (cid:18) 1 1 + κ ν PTCCIPTCCI (cid:19)(cid:19) & CI max = ci max . recalling that we have no restricted range for ptc yet ( so we use its theoretical range for now - between zero and one ) . Throughout this section , the most important thing is that we assume nothing as use of an overly restricted range could lead to false conclusions . So far , our SPN’s connectivity made choosing the next node in our circuit intuitive , but CI has an out - degree of two ( connected to both ptc and CN ) . How do we negotiate the subgraph formed by the CI , CN and ptc nodes ? Aside 6 . 4 . 2 Accuracy of our ﬁndings seems synonymous with the taking of care here - we propose that any path around the circuit should avoid “going back on itself” as much as 134 possible . We tested alternative paths to the one described here but they sometimes produced false results . Our path alternates between the two nodes , CN and ptc , as follows ( with CN ﬁrst ) . We start by ﬁnding CN ’s restricted maximum , CN max ( we have no way of allocating a value , other than zero , to CN min without a restricted range for ptc ) . We have two possible expressions for CN max , CN max = H CN C CI (cid:32) 1 1 + κ ν PTCCI PTCCI (cid:33) CI max or CN max = H CN H CI ( ci max − CI min ) ( 6 . 2 ) the former found using CN ’s associated ODE , ( 10 . 27 ) , the latter by corrupting an expression for steady state CN ( see ( 3 . 6 ) ) . We proceed with whichever CN max value is smaller . Together with CI min , we feed CN max into our steady state expression for ptc ( see ( 10 . 24 ) ) to ﬁnd its restricted minimum , ptc min = CI min (cid:32) κ ν CNptcCNptc κ ν CNptcCNptc + CN ν CNptcmax (cid:33) ν CIptc κ ν CIptc CIptc + CI min (cid:32) κ ν CNptcCNptc κ ν CNptcCNptc + CN ν CNptcmax (cid:33) ν CIptc which is then fed back into ( 10 . 27 ) , together with CI min to obtain CN min , CN min = H CN C CI (cid:32) ptc ν PTCCI min ptc ν PTCCI min + κ ν PTCCI PTCCI (cid:33) CI min . Substitution of CN min and CI max into ( 10 . 24 ) describes , ptc max = CI max (cid:32) κ ν CNptcCNptc κ ν CNptcCNptc + CN ν CNptcmin (cid:33) ν CIptc κ ν CIptc CIptc + CI max (cid:32) κ ν CNptcCNptc κ ν CNptc CNptc + CN ν CNptc min (cid:33) ν CIptc . As we arrive at the sixth node in our circuit , wg , we hope our method is apparent - a node’s restricted maximum / minimum is obtained by maximizing / minimizing all positive inputs and minimizing / maximizing all negative inputs in its associated ODE , at steady state . Our wg node has three inputs - two positive ( IWG and CI ) and one negative ( CN ) . Using ( 10 . 20 ) we obtain , wg min = α CIwg CI min (cid:32) κ ν CNwg CNwg κ ν CNwgCNwg + CN ν CNwgmax (cid:33) ν CIwg 1 + α CIwg CI min (cid:32) κ ν CNwgCNwg κ ν CNwgCNwg + CN ν CNwgmax (cid:33) ν CIwg & wg max = α WGwg + α CIwg CI max (cid:32) κ ν CNwg CNwg κ ν CNwgCNwg + CN ν CNwgmin (cid:33) ν CIwg 1 + α WGwg + α CIwg CI max (cid:32) κ ν CNwgCNwg κ ν CNwgCNwg + CN ν CNwgmin (cid:33) ν CIwg 135 recalling that we do not have a restricted range for IWG as yet ( so we let the IWG - wg link be one at its maximum , zero at its minimum ) . The seventh node in our circuit is IWG which has two inputs , both positive ( wg and EWG ) . Using ( 10 . 21 ) , we obtain , IWG min = wg min ( 1 + H IWG r ExoWG ) recalling that we do not have a restricted range for EWG as yet ( so we let the minimum value of EWG i , T equal zero here ) . Calculation of IWG max is not yet possible without a maximal value for EWG i , T , but as this depends on IWG max in turn , we must forego IWG max for now . Yet it is possible to ﬁnd restricted maxima for EWG i , j without IWG max , since we can express its equilibria as functions of wg only . Note 6 . 4 . 1 Some manipulation of the ODEs associated to IWG and EWG ( see ( 10 . 21 ) and ( 10 . 22 ) respectively ) at steady state ultimately leads to an elimination of IWG from the latter . This manipulation is described as an appendix . At steady state , all EWG can be written as some function of wg , say χ such that , EWG i , j = χ (cid:16) wg i (cid:17) where χ is deﬁned in an appendix . And since wg ’s restricted range doesn’t depend on i , we have that , EWG min = χ (cid:16) wg min (cid:17) & EWG max = χ (cid:16) wg max (cid:17) and , whilst the former of these two is perfectly acceptable , we prefer to make use of our known IWG min through ( 10 . 29 ) ( to be found in the aforementioned appendix ) , i . e . EWG i , j = N − 1 IWG = ⇒ EWG min = N − 1 IWG min where the inverse of N exists if it has non - zero determinant . The ninth and ﬁnal node of our circuit is en . Substitution of CN min / CN max , together with maximal / 136 minimal EWG n , T into our ODEs for en , ( 10 . 19 ) , at steady state gives us en max and en min respectively . Having completed our path around the circuit , we now repeat the process except that wherever , previously , we used theoretical ranges for our nodes , we now use our restricted ranges in their place . Repeating our path around the circuit brings our calculations of a node’s restricted range closer to its actual range . If a node’s restricted minimum is above our ON / OFF threshold , we know its expression to be ubiquitous . More seldom , if a node’s restricted maximum is below this threshold , we know that its expression is absent in all cells . 6 . 4 . 1 Toy model example I Let us explicitly work a parameter set through the circuit of our toy model ( see Aside 6 . 3 . 1 for ODEs ) e . g . the following set . κ Ja = 0 . 4815 , κ ba = 0 . 0066 , κ Kb = 0 . 0016 , κ ab = 0 . 0080 , ν ba = 2 . 8481 , ν ab = 1 . 4091 , H a = 87 . 2392 , H b = 46 . 5141 Initially , all we know are the theoretical ranges of nodes a and b whether parameters place restrictions on them or otherwise . In the case of our toy model , both a and b have theoretical ranges between zero and , a max = b max = 0 . 4 0 . 001 + 0 . 4 = 0 . 9975 ( 4 d . p . ) . Substituting these values together with parameter values into the ODEs associ - ated to the nodes of our toy model circuit produces restricted ranges for a and b . Substitution of a max into our ODE for b at steady state gives , b min = 0 . 4 (cid:18) 0 . 0080 1 . 4091 0 . 0080 1 . 4091 + a 1 . 4091 max (cid:19) 0 . 0016 + 0 . 4 (cid:18) 0 . 0080 1 . 4091 0 . 0080 1 . 4091 + a 1 . 4091 max (cid:19) = 0 . 2204 ( 4 d . p . ) at which point , we need take this example no further . Here , we see that b ’s value is greater than the ON / OFF threshold , throughout all cells . Using parameters alone , we have shown that expression of b in our toy model would be ubiquitous . 137 6 . 5 Couplings - Regions of uncertainty In Note 6 . 2 . 1 , we said that the CN - en and IWG - wg links were the most signiﬁcant couplings in our SPN . Let us now elaborate on this . 6 . 5 . 1 Induction of wg by IWG Let us suppose that the link between IWG and wg , represented by  IWG ν WGwg i κ ν WGwg WGwg + IWG ν WGwg i  in our ODEs , is stripeless , i . e . cannot vary in value for di ﬀ erent i . In such a case , wg ’s capacity for striped expression would depend entirely on its other inputs ( CI and CN ) . Can CI and CN combine to produce wild - type stripes in wg as part of a striped solution ? Perhaps it may help to go around the circuit of our SPN , described in our previous section . Aside 6 . 5 . 1 Recall , wild - type expression of wg has a cell two bias , i . e . wild - type wg = ( OFF , ON , OFF , OFF ) whilst wild - type expression of en has a cell three bias , i . e . wild - type en = ( OFF , OFF , ON , OFF ) . For any striped solution , expression of initial node en has a cell three bias , which is imposed on second node ci by deﬁnition ( ci ’s other input is dummy node B , which has no bias of expression ) . The next nodes in our circuit come from the subgraph formed by CI , CN and ptc . Were CI ( which is fed by ci ) or CN to have anything other than a cell three bias in such a case , the only possible cause would be ptc , but ptc ’s inputs are CI and CN themselves . In e ﬀ ect then , the three - node subgraph “takes order” from its only input , ci , which has a cell three bias for striped solutions . Aside 6 . 5 . 2 Moreover , ci , CI , CN and ptc all have a cell three bias initially in our SPN . Thus , CI and CN must both have a cell three bias , when part of a striped solution . We don’t believe two such nodes could produce a cell two bias in wg , even in combination . Therefore , if the value of the IWG - wg link does not vary between 138 cells , there can be no striped solution . Whilst the author acknowledges that this proof by contradiction is hardly rigorous , he hopes the reader satisﬁed by his reasoning . It is thus possible to identify a bad parameter set from a stripeless IWG - wg link . 6 . 5 . 2 Repression of en by CN Let us suppose that the link between CN and en , represented by (cid:32) κ ν CNen CNen κ ν CNen CNen + CN ν CNen i (cid:33) ν WGen in our ODEs , is stripeless , i . e . cannot vary for di ﬀ erent i . In such a case , en ’s capacity for striped expression depends entirely on its other input , EWG n , T . Can EWG n , T produce wild - type stripes in en as part of a striped solution ? Let us use the circuit of our SPN , described in our previous section . For any striped solution , wg has a cell two bias of expression . The next nodes in our circuit come from the subgraph formed by IWG and EWG . We have estab - lished above that wg cannot have a cell two bias as part of a striped solution unless the IWG - wg link provides it . Thus , IWG must have a cell two bias here too . This cell bias is then fed into EWG as part of the sub - graph . Initially , EWG has no bias of expression in our SPN , so the cell two bias of IWG is the only bias that exists in the sub - graph . Thus , same - cell cumulative concen - trations of EWG , EWG i , T , will have some degree of cell two bias of expression as part of a striped solution . Recall , the input to en is neighboring - cell cumulative concentrations of EWG , i . e . EWG n , T and not EWG i , T . With regards to striped solutions , those EWG nodes which are linked to IWG 2 will have the highest values . Indeed , there is a general downward cascade of EWG concentrations , the further we move away from the second cell ( which contains IWG 2 ) . Thus , concentrations of EWG 2 , 1 will be highest , whilst those of EWG 4 , 1 139 lowest . By deﬁnition then ( see ( 5 . 15 ) ) , EWG n , T must be highest in cell two , i . e . has a cell two bias for striped solutions . Therefore , if the value of the CN - en link does not vary between cells , there can be no striped solution . It is thus possible to identify a bad parameter set from a stripeless CN - en link . 6 . 5 . 3 A recapitulation Our SPN is characterised by the striped expression of key SP genes en and wg , for which they rely upon certain regulating proteins . Some of these regulatory relationships are described by Hill functions , i . e . those of the form ( 6 . 1 ) , whose behaviour is schematically represented by D - R curves . If these D - R curves were su ﬃ ciently truncated , we could infer that the represented function takes the same value in all cells . Such a ( stripeless ) coupling between regulator and target could not produce striped expression in the target . There are couplings , e . g . IWG - wg and CN - en which , if stripeless , would signal the impossibility of a striped solution . We have only to show how to foretell such signiﬁcant truncations in D - R curves . 6 . 5 . 4 How ? Figure 6 . 5 : A D - R curve ( left ) and its “approximation” ( right ) . What do we know ? D - R curves are constructed on the theoretical , rather than restricted , range of a regulating node , say Y . By imposing our restricted nodal range onto the D - R curve , we may truncate it ( let the black box in Fig . 6 . 6 mark out Y ’s restricted range ) . Of particular interest to us is when this truncation removes the D - R curve’s slope ( as it would mean the associated coupling were stripeless ) . Thus , 140 we need to know where a D - R curve’s slope begins and ends - for what values of Y ? Position of the D - R curve’s slope depends solely upon values of parameters in the associated Hill function . For a general Hill function ( 6 . 1 ) , the D - R curve’s mid - point , relative to the axes is given by letting f equal one half and solving for X or Y . By measuring its gradient at this midpoint , we can approximate the D - R curve’s slope to a line ( by extending the associated tangent the full length of the vertical axis , as in Fig . 6 . 5 ) . Let us think of this tangent as the hypotenuse of a right - angled triangle which , for all parameters , has a height of one . Summary 6 . 5 . 1 For ( 6 . 1 ) , Y (cid:18) f = 1 2 (cid:19) = X (cid:20) 2 1 ν 2 − 1 (cid:21) 1 ν which deﬁnes the midpoint of Fig . 6 . 5’s slope and d f dY = − ν 2 (cid:18) X ν X ν + Y ν (cid:19) ν 2 − 1 (cid:34) X ν Y ν ν ( X ν + Y ν ) 2 Y (cid:35) which deﬁnes the gradient of Fig . 6 . 5’s slope . Together , these imply that the gradient of Fig . 6 . 5’s slope at its midpoint is , d f dY (cid:18) f = 1 2 (cid:19) = − ν 2 ν  2 − 1 ν 2 2 X  (cid:20) 2 1 ν 2 − 1 (cid:21) 1 − 1 ν . Of this triangle ( see Fig . 6 . 5 ) the height and gradient are known to us , hence the base can be calculated via a division of the height by the gradient . Of any base , we have both the midpoint and its length - the addition / subtraction of half this length to / from the midpoint thus gives the base’s endpoints . We refer to these endpoints as the maximum / minimum of the “region of uncertainty” ( ROU ) respectively . Summary 6 . 5 . 2 For ( 6 . 1 ) , the length of Fig . 6 . 5’s triangle’s base is , | ROU | = − 2 1 ν 2 (cid:18) 2 X ν 2 ν (cid:19) (cid:20) 2 1 ν 2 − 1 (cid:21) 1 ν − 1 . Therefore , endpoints of the triangle’s base are given by , ROU = X (cid:20) 2 1 ν 2 − 1 (cid:21) 1 ν ± 2 1 ν 2 (cid:18) X ν 2 ν (cid:19) (cid:20) 2 1 ν 2 − 1 (cid:21) 1 ν − 1 which enclose the ROU . 141 Therefore , using only a Hill function’s parameters , we can approximate endpoints of the associated D - R curve’s slope . Proposition 6 . 5 . 1 Let the ROU associated with any coupling between regulator P and target m be denoted ROU Pm ∈ [ ROU min , ROU max ] . A coupling of type ( 6 . 1 ) ( a Hill function ) is stripeless if either , P min > ROU max or P max < ROU min where P min and P max deﬁne the restricted range of P , found using our circuit method . Figure 6 . 6 : Approximated D - R curve with ROU ( left ) & resulting truncation ( right ) . Note 6 . 5 . 1 If ( hand - drawn ) Figure 6 . 6 is visually accurate , then it seems that even a truncated D - R curve does not restrict f to a single value . However we claim it does , assuming that , not only our SPN reaches a steady state within a thousand minutes , but that so too do the Hill functions of our SPN ( see “Repression terms” section in our third chapter ) . For a Hill function , ( 6 . 1 ) , steady states of f satisfy df dY = 0 . Here df dY = − (cid:16) ν 2 ν Y (cid:17) f (cid:0) 1 − f (cid:1) 1 ν 2 and df dY = 0 is satisﬁed by f = 1 and f = 0 , the horizontal parts of the D - R curve . 6 . 5 . 5 Toy model example II Suppose we have the following parameter set in our toy model . κ Ja = 0 . 3446 , κ ba = 0 . 0151 , κ Kb = 0 . 0143 , κ ab = 0 . 0011 , ν ba = 1 . 3794 , ν ab = 1 . 8662 , H a = 31 . 0915 , H b = 11 . 4118 142 Using our circuit method , we ﬁnd restricted ranges for a and b , a ∈ [ 0 . 0054 , 0 . 5370 ] & b ∈ (cid:104) 2 . 6791 × 10 − 4 , 0 . 5757 (cid:105) . We cannot rule out the possibility that either a or b is capable of striped expression ( on in some cell , o ﬀ in another ) . Let us employ our ROU method . The Hill function in our ODE for b ( see Aside 6 . 3 . 1 ) is , f ( a ) = (cid:32) κ ν ab ab κ ν ab ab + a ν ab (cid:33) whose behaviour , as a function , obeys a D - R curve . The midpoint of this D - R curve’s slope satisﬁes f ( a ) equals one half and , f ( a ) = 1 2 = ⇒ a = κ ba is the midpoint relative to the horizontal axis . The associated ROU approximates endpoints of the D - R curve’s slope , relative to the horizontal axis . For this , we need the gradient - equal to f (cid:48) ( a ) ( where (cid:48) denotes di ﬀ erentiation with respect to a ) - at the slope’s midpoint . f (cid:48) ( a = κ ba ) = − ν ba 4 κ ba = ⇒ | ROU | = 1 ÷ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) − ν ba 4 κ ba (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = 4 κ ba ν ba = ⇒ ROU ∈ (cid:20) κ ba − 2 κ ba ν ba , κ ba + 2 κ ba ν ba (cid:21) Figure 6 . 7 shows the mental image we now form . All restricted values of f ( a ) ( those within the thick black box ) must be similar , from which we assume that , in all cells , they will tend to the same steady state . If f ( a ) - representative of a ’s repression of b - does not vary between cells , neither can b ’s expression , at steady state . Therefore b cannot achieve a striped expression . 6 . 6 Discussion We estimate that our circuit and ROU methods combine to ﬁnd at least around a third of all “bad” parameter sets in our SPN . A full list of the scenarios by which we identify such parameter sets is given as an appendix . If we additionally use the necessary bigness of κ CIwg ( in itself and when raised to the power ν CIwg ) observed previously as a condition for good parameter sets , we are able to predict at least three quarters of all bad parameter sets . 143 Figure 6 . 7 : What calculations tell us ( left ) & with ﬁgures ( right ) . Note 6 . 6 . 1 In two separate runs of our SPN , both consisting of one hundred randomly generated parameter sets , we predicted seventy ﬁve and seventy four of the bad parameters sets ( with the outlined methods ) . However , the ﬁrst run featured one striped solution and the second run three so our methods predicted seventy six per - cent of the bad parameter sets in both cases . Of this seventy six per - cent , thirty two and thirty six per - cent respectively were found using our circuit and ROU methods . None of the conditions used here depend on our SPN’s initial conditions ( ICs ) . As such , what we have found here is that at least three quarters of all parameter sets will not work for any ICs . This may not seem signiﬁcant here as we have used ideal ICs ( those close to the target pattern ) but it would have been , had we not . In [ 1 ] , von Dassow et al . reported an increased frequency of striped solutions as ICs grew ever closer to the target pattern but , what we ﬁnd here is that , there is a limit to that growth . A great proportion of internal environments ( parameter sets ) could never harbour characteristic asymmetry in our SPN . 6 . 6 . 1 Importance of CN This whole chapter was about unearthing the limitations of our SPN . In construct - ing our circuit , it became apparent that the ratio of just two parameters was hugely important . In ( 6 . 2 ) , the relative size of half - lives H CI and H CN can substantially restrict CN ’s range . If CN ’s range is restricted , it is more likely that the key CN - en 144 link will be restricted too . When H CN is less than H CI , i . e . when CN decays more quickly than CI , it re - stricts CN ’s range . This restriction on CN means that other parameters have less scope if the parameter set is to produce a striped solution in our SPN ( as they have to be more ideal to compensate for CN being less ideal ) . We note that only one third of the striped solutions shown in our previous chapter has a value of H CN smaller than its H CI value . 6 . 6 . 2 Reverse engineering of ROU method ? Our ROU method allows us to ﬁnd “bad” parameter sets , but what do such sets have in common that makes them bad ? One measure of such badness is a stripeless CN - en link . In a test of one hundred parameter sets , we were able to predict ( with our ROU method ) twenty one which had a stripeless CN - en link ( the value of which was predicted as big in every cell ) . Aside 6 . 6 . 1 In our SPN , the CN - en link is described by the Hill function , (cid:32) κ ν CNen CNen κ ν CNen CNen + CN ν CNen i (cid:33) ν WGen . A big value for the CN - en link means that CN ’s repression of en was weak . There are two possible causes - either CN concentrations are low in all cells and / or CN ’s repression of en is impotent . All twenty one parameter sets cited above showed marked impotency in the CN - en link - we found that all had a value of κ CNen greater than 0 . 08 ( κ CNen takes values between 0 . 001 and one where smaller values mark greater potency in the CN - en link ) . 6 . 7 Conclusion Whether von Dassow et al . were right to describe the SPN as robust in [ 1 ] , there exist internal environments of a fruit ﬂy ( as described by parameters ) which are 145 predisposed to be bad and they can be foreseen . Von Dassow et al . found that the frequency of striped solutions increased as the closeness between initial conditions ( ICs ) and wild - type expression grew . Conversely we ﬁnd that there are many parameter sets which could not provide a striped solution for any ICs . If the parameter - space of our SPN contains all internal environments a fruit ﬂy can possibly experience , we ﬁnd that a large fraction of these ( at least three quar - ters ) represent a developmental abnormality to which a fruit ﬂy’s current state ( our methods have no dependence on ICs ) o ﬀ ers no resistance when one of these catastrophic environments manifests . Such high proportions of catastrophe mean that any change in internal environment endangers the development of even a thereto healthy fruit ﬂy . We identiﬁed three ways in which a set of SPN conditions ( parameter set ) might show itself to be ill - fated . Each way reveals a di ﬀ erent intrinsic ﬂaw that prevents characteristic asymmetry ( simultaneous wild - type stripes of both key SP genes , en and wg ) in our SPN . Our circuit method asks if key SP genes can have any sort of striped expression ( on in some cell ( s ) , o ﬀ in others ) . Our ROU method asks whether the wild - type expressions of key SP genes are mutually exclusive . Our condition on κ CIwg asks whether CI - induction of wg is weak enough to avoid key SP gene wg being turned on outside cell two ( wild - type wg is expressed exclusively in cell two ) . But it is our ROU method ( i . e . our use of D - R curves ) we would highlight to our reader - it uses SPN conditions ( parameters ) to predict the concentrations of protein required to avoid abnormal development of a fruit ﬂy . Together with our circuit , our ROU method exposes the most devastating conditions - those which will cause abnormal development in all fruit ﬂies . In this chapter , we focussed on the absence of characteristic asymmetry in our SPN , showing that abnormal genetic expression could be predicted . This could 146 lead to an understanding of its warning signs . Von Dassow et al . found that the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry was robust to variation - we have shown that so too is its absence . We expose the reliance of key SP genes en and wg on CN - repression and IWG - induction respectively . The success of our SPN ( in achieving characteristic asymmetry ) depends on the success of this regulation . 6 . 7 . 1 Our next chapter In our “Jacobian” chapter , we were able to show how the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry could be stably maintained and , in the following chapter , what made it possible . We proposed that a requirement for characteristic asymmetry , was weak CI - induction of key SP gene wg and so too the absence of wg ’s CI / CN - based regula - tion . Might we not further our understanding of the SPN by enforcing this absence ? In our next chapter , we break the connection between cubitus interruptus pro - teins ( CI and CN ) and key SP gene wg . By removing a potential barrier to the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry , it is easier to ﬁnd further barriers as well as in - creasing our familiarity with this asymmetry ( as the frequency with which we see it increases ) . For the ﬁrst time , we are able to go into some detail as to exact relationship between conditions and outcome in our SPN . 147 Chapter 7 Breakdown of SPN 7 . 1 Introduction Our SPN en sub - system wg sub - system EWG signal CI / CN - wg Figure 7 . 1 : Our SPN : Two sub - systems connected by EWG - en and CI / CN - wg links . Our SPN might be thought of as two connected sub - systems ( see Fig . 7 . 1 ) - one comprising nodes whose modes of expression have a cell three bias ( en sub - system - see Fig . 10 . 4 ) for striped solutions and one containing nodes whose modes of expression have a cell two bias ( wg sub - system - see Fig . 7 . 2 ) for striped solutions . In our “First impressions” chapter , we proposed that the characteristic asymmetry of the SPN would only be seen when cubitus interruptus proteins ( CI and CN ) had no overall inﬂuence on target gene wg . We have since supported this claim with trends in parameters associated to the CI / CN - wg link ( see “Our SPN” chapter ) . Given these trends , we infer that the absence of the CI / CN - wg link would in - crease the fruit ﬂy’s chances of wild - type development . With the CI / CN - wg link absent , the wg sub - system becomes independent of our SPN and can be analysed in isolation . 148 The wg sub - system ( over a four cell segment ) has twenty nodes and ten param - eters associated to it . We ﬁnd ( using both ODEs and phase portraits ) there to be couplets and triads of parameters amongst these ten which , together , play the key role in deciding the fate of key SP gene wg . Behaviour of the wg sub - system can be modeled by phase portrait when the EWG - to - IWG link is absent ( as each cell then contains an independent 2 - D system ) . We ﬁnd that rates of cytosis ( the exchange of protein between IWG and EWG ) is of huge importance to the mode of wg expression ( and therefore to character - istic asymmetry in our SPN ) . For example , there is a positive correlation between the absence of wg expression and higher rates of exocytosis , whereas ubiquitous wg expression is more prevalent for a higher rate of endocytosis . Wild - type wg expression is most common when rates of both exocytosis and endocytosis are lower . 7 . 2 A new perspective Robustness of the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry was celebrated by von Dassow et al . in [ 1 ] . As our reader may have expected and as we found in our previous chapter , an absence of characteristic asymmetry is also robust . By robustness , we mean that very di ﬀ erent sizes of the same parameter could produce the same outcome in the SPN as the determining factor in deciding the outcome is the context in which a parameter is found ( i . e . size of other parameters ) . Note 7 . 2 . 1 Whilst the SPN’s robustness is interesting , it does not promote the ideal of linking conditions in the SPN ( as deﬁned by the model’s parameters ) to its behaviour ( modes of genetic expression which result from those conditions , as deﬁned by values of the model’s variables ) . 149 It is this ﬂexibility which makes it so hard to establish a link between conditions ( parameters ) and the resulting behaviour in our SPN . For some SPN behaviours , there can be great variety in the conditions which harbours them . Nevertheless , we set out to identify parameter trends associated to di ﬀ erent types of SPN behaviour in this chapter . The size of our SPN makes this di ﬃ cult , but with reductionism - i . e . by splitting our SPN into two sub - systems - it is achievable in part . In the following pair of subsections , we explain how we intend to form a connection between SPN conditions and behaviour . 7 . 2 . 1 Combinations In our previous chapter , we made progress more through mathematical quirks of the model than from any intrinsic understanding of biology . And though we were pleased with the successes of our circuit and ROU methods , we were yet left wondering about its distinction of conditions ( parameter sets they predicted to be universally bad ) . Although we could tell , we still had no great feel for , which con - ditions were good and which were bad for our SPN . We have three main ﬁndings from our previous two chapters . Firstly , most conditions ( parameter sets ) do not allow for wild - type expression of key SP genes ( en and wg ) in our SPN . Secondly , even those which do allow for it have to nullify the link between wg and two of its regulators ( CI and CN ) . Thirdly , most values of most parameters “work” within the context of some parameter set . In this chapter , we wish to expand on our third ﬁnding . Apart from restricted parameters such as κ CIwg ( see “Our SPN” chapter ) , the fate of our SPN depends not so much on the values of individual parameters , but on the context in which they ﬁnd themselves , i . e . it is combinations of parameters which dictate modes of expression in our SPN . 150 7 . 2 . 2 Breakdown of SPN Our SPN may be thought of as two sub - systems operating in parallel ( see Figures 7 . 1 and 5 . 7 ) . We refer to them hence as the en sub - system and the wg sub - system . They form a single system via the connectivity between them , part of which is the link between cubitus interruptus proteins ( CI and CN ) and wg . We believe that our SPN only replicates characteristic asymmetry when this link is ubiquitously turned o ﬀ ( equivalent to an absence of the link ) . Without the CI / CN - wg link , our wg sub - system ( composed of the wg , IWG and EWG nodes and their interactions in our SPN ) receives no input from our en sub - system ( comprising all other nodes in our SPN , together with their interaction ) . Since our wg sub - system isolates itself in this way for characteristic asymmetry ( it is not inﬂuenced by the en sub - system ) , why not analyze it in isolation ? When characteristic asymmetry is seen in our SPN , the wg sub - system feeds the en sub - system . Hence , regardless of what happens in the en sub - system , we ﬁrst need to know how the wg sub - system works if we are to understand the robustness of our SPN’s characteristic asymmetry . In this chapter we attempt to derive rules by which key SP gene wg behaves when the foremost barrier to characteristic asymmetry has been removed from our SPN ( the CI / CN - wg link ) . 7 . 2 . 3 Wingless sub - system Our wg sub - system is shown in Figure 7 . 2 and its associated ODEs below . These ODEs match those used in our ( as well as von Dassow’s ) SPN for respective nodes except that , we use a new ODE for wg ( from which the CI / CN - wg link is absent ) . dwg i d τ = T 0 H wg       α WGwg (cid:32) IWG ν WGwgi κ ν WGwgWGwg + IWG ν WGwgi (cid:33) 1 + α WGwg (cid:32) IWG ν WGwgi κ ν WGwgWGwg + IWG ν WGwgi (cid:33) − wg i       ( 7 . 1 ) dIWG i d τ = T 0 H IWG (cid:0) wg i − IWG i (cid:1) + T 0 (cid:0) r EndoWG EWG i , T − r ExoWG IWG i (cid:1) ( 7 . 2 ) 151 Figure 7 . 2 : Our wg sub - system : Each cell has ﬁve nodes - wg , IWG and one EWG on each cell face . The wg sub - system emerges as an independent sub - system , where characteristic asymmetry is seen in our SPN . dEWG i , j d τ = T 0 (cid:18) r ExoWG IWG i 3 + r MxferWG EWG n , j + 3 + r LMxferWG EWG i , lr (cid:19) − T 0 (cid:18) r EndoWG + r MxferWG + 2 r LMxferWG + 1 H EWG (cid:19) EWG i , j . Aside 7 . 2 . 1 Initial conditions here are wg i ( τ = 0 ) equals ( 0 . 001 , 1 , 0 . 001 , 0 . 001 ) , IWG i ( τ = 0 ) equals ( 0 . 001 , 1 , 0 . 001 , 0 . 001 ) and EWG ( τ = 0 ) equals 0 . 001 for all i = [ 1 , 4 ] and j = [ 1 , 3 ] . In testing our wg sub - system ( we supply some unﬁltered sample data as an ap - pendix - around one hundred random parameter sets were generated using Mat - lab ) , we saw only three di ﬀ erent modes of expression for key SP gene wg - wild - type , ubiquitously on and ubiquitously o ﬀ . These may or may not be the only the only possible expressions here , but they are certainly the most common and , as such , we make them the subject of study here . Let us begin by considering a simpliﬁed version of our wg sub - system . 7 . 3 2 - D system Let us consider a simpliﬁed version of our wg sub - system ( where IWG and EWG nodes are decoupled ) . As our main interest is the behaviour of key SP gene wg , we focus on the resulting two coupled nodes inside each cell ( these being wg and IWG ) . Is this simpliﬁcation ( decoupling IWG and EWG ) reasonable ? 152 wg IWG wg IWG wg IWG wg IWG Figure 7 . 3 : Independent 2 - D system which emerges from wg sub - system . Aside 7 . 3 . 1 Decoupling means that a coupling is “turned o ﬀ ” whether because the node from which the coupling originates is turned o ﬀ or because parameters associated to the coupling dictate that it is only weak . An independent two node system emerges in each cell if the EWG - to - IWG coupling ( as opposed to the IWG - to - EWG coupling ) is turned o ﬀ in all cells . From ( 7 . 2 ) , the ODE for IWG in our wg sub - system , we can see that this could result from either su ﬃ ciently small values of EWG i , T and / or of r EndoWG , for example . Thus , an independent two dimensional ( 2 - D ) system ( see Fig . 7 . 3 ) is not unrealistic . Behaviour of such a system can be depicted by a phase portrait . 7 . 3 . 1 Phase portraits The typical trajectories of our 2 - D dynamical system can be represented geomet - rically by the plotting of curves in the phase plane ( formed by axes representing the size of the two variables wg and IWG ) . To determine these curves , our starting point is the system’s nullclines . The nullcline of wg ( or IWG ) is a line or curve on which all values ( of both wg and IWG ) satisfy wg (cid:48) = 0 ( or IWG (cid:48) = 0 ) , where (cid:48) denotes derivatives with respect to τ . Hence , our nullclines satisfy , wg = α WGwg (cid:32) IWG ν WGwg κ ν WGwgWGwg + IWG ν WGwg (cid:33) 1 + α WGwg (cid:32) IWG ν WGwg κ ν WGwgWGwg + IWG ν WGwg (cid:33) & IWG = wg ( 1 + r ExoWG H IWG ) ( 7 . 3 ) 153 and these nullclines are shown ( separately to begin with for the sake of clarity ) in Figure 7 . 4 . Nullclines intersect when both wg (cid:48) and IWG (cid:48) equal zero , i . e . when our 2 - D system is at steady state . Although the general shape of the nullclines stays the same , their gradients vary according to the values of parameters associated to equations ( 7 . 3 ) . In consequence , the relative position of our nullclines depends on parameters - we believe that there are three characteristic cases ( where nullcline intersections number between one and three ) . Let us consider these three cases . Figure 7 . 4 : 2 - D wg sub - system nullclines ( left : wg nullcline , right : IWG nullcline ) . 7 . 3 . 2 One ﬁxed point Figure 7 . 5 : One ﬁxed point : Nullclines intersect at origin only . As ( wg , IWG ) equals ( 0 , 0 ) is always a solution to ( wg (cid:48) , IWG (cid:48) ) equals ( 0 , 0 ) ( see ( 7 . 3 ) equations ) , both nullclines must intersect at the origin - thus it is a ﬁxed point of our 2 - D system . For some parameter values , this is the only intersection , hence an unique ﬁxed point . This would represent a system in which wg expres - sion were turned o ﬀ in each cell at steady state . How do we use the nullclines to 154 deﬁne the typical trajectories of our 2 - D system ? Note 7 . 3 . 1 From the ODEs which govern our 2 - D system , it is clear that no trajectories diverge to inﬁnity . Our ODE for wg in our 2 - D system - see ( 7 . 1 ) - shows that dwg i d τ is negative for all values of wg i greater than 1011 . Similarly , our ODE for IWG in our 2 - D system , i . e . dIWG i d τ = T 0 H IWG (cid:0) wg i − IWG i (cid:1) − T 0 r ExoWG IWG i shows that dIWG i d τ is negative for all values of IWG i greater than or equal to wg i . Every point in the phase plane which does not lie on the nullcline for wg ( or IWG ) is a point for which wg (cid:48) ( or IWG (cid:48) ) is non - zero . The state of the system at such points in not steady but is moving towards a steady state ( if one exists ) . This movement can be described by vectors ( as shown in Figure 7 . 5 for our 2 - D system when it has a unique ﬁxed point ) and , from these , we can infer the typical trajectories of the system . From Figure 7 . 5 , it is clear that the system moves toward the state in which wg is turned o ﬀ in all cells . Our interest here is what separates this case ( with just one ﬁxed point ) from other cases ( with multiple ﬁxed points ) . Let us now discuss the latter case . 7 . 3 . 3 Multiple ﬁxed points Figure 7 . 6 : Two ﬁxed points : IWG nullcline is tangent to wg nullcline . When the nullclines of our 2 - D system intersect more than once , its state may be something other than an ubiquitous absence of wg expression ( e . g . ubiquitous or 155 wild - type expression ) . As our wg nullcline is a monotonically increasing sigmoid curve and our IWG nullcline is a straight line ( see Fig . 7 . 4 ) , they can intersect thrice at most . The case for which there are two intersections exists only when our IWG nullcline is tangential to our wg nullcline ( see Fig . 7 . 6 ) and , as such , requires a more speciﬁc relative position of nullclines than the other two cases ( one or three intersections - for the latter , see Fig . 7 . 7 ) . Figure 7 . 7 : 2 - D system with three ﬁxed points . 7 . 3 . 4 Distinguishing these cases IWG wg 0 IWG wg 0 IWG wg 0 Figure 7 . 8 : From left to right : Phase portraits for 2 - D system with one , two and three ﬁxed points respectively . How do we distinguish between the two cases ? Our 2 - D system has either a unique ﬁxed point ( which corresponds to an ubiquitous non - expression of key SP wg ) or multiple ﬁxed points ( for which wild - type and ubiquitous wg expression are possible ) . Thus , by distinguishing the phase portraits ( see Fig . 7 . 8 ) , we can distinguish the cases for which wild - type expression of key SP wg is and is not 156 possible . For instance , by comparing Figures 7 . 5 , 7 . 6 and 7 . 7 ) , we can see that the more shallow our IWG nullcline ( the more ﬂat it is to the wg - axis ) , the more likely it is that our 2 - D system has an unique ﬁxed point . The gradient of our IWG nullcline ( which we note is always less than one ) is given by , dIWG dwg = 1 ( 1 + r ExoWG H IWG ) ( 7 . 4 ) where a bigger denominator on the RHS corresponds to a more shallow IWG nullcline . Thus , for larger values of r ExoWG H IWG , an ubiquitous absence of wg expression in our 2 - D system is more to be expected than its wild - type or ubiquitous expression . This is also true the more “squashed” our wg nullcline is ( toward the upper left quadrant of the phase plane ) . The smaller that part of the wg - axis spanned by our wg nullcline , the more squashed said nullcline must be . From equations ( 7 . 3 ) , it is clear that the maximum value of points which lie on our wg nullcline is determined primarily by α WGwg ( smaller values of which describe a wg nullcline which is more squashed into the left half of the phase plane ) . How squashed our wg nullcline is , relative to the upper half of our phase plane , might be inferred to some extent from , IWG half = κ WGwg (cid:104) 1 + α WGwg (cid:105) − 1 ν WGwg . ( 7 . 5 ) The midpoint of our wg nullcline , relative to the wg - axis , corresponds to this value of IWG , IWG half . Thus , higher values of IWG half describe a wg nullcline which is more squashed ( toward the upper half of the phase plane ) and this is the case for larger κ WGwg , smaller α WGwg and bigger ν WGwg . And therefore , our wg nullcline is more likely to be squashed into the upper left quadrant of the phase plane for larger values of κ WGwg , smaller values of α WGwg and bigger values of ν WGwg . Summary 7 . 3 . 1 In our 2 - D system , an ubiquitous absence of wg expression is more ( less ) likely for larger ( smaller ) values of r ExoWG , larger ( smaller ) values of H IWG , larger ( smaller ) values of κ WGwg , smaller ( larger ) values of α WGwg and larger ( smaller ) values of ν WGwg . But these trends only separate an ubiquitous absence of wg expression from other modes ( of expression ) . How do we separate these other modes ? In particular , how 157 do we separate wild - type from ubiquitous wg expression ? At this stage we note that , for our choice of ICs ( see Aside 7 . 2 . 1 ) , ( wg 2 , IWG 2 ) = ( 1 , 1 ) is drawn to that ﬁxed point with the highest value of wg . Note 7 . 3 . 2 Our IWG nullcline always has a gradient less than one - see ( 7 . 4 ) - and all points which lie on our wg nullcline must have a value of wg less than one - see ( 7 . 3 ) . Therefore ( wg , IWG ) = ( 1 , 1 ) is in the attracting region of the ﬁxed point with the highest value of wg in all cases ( see Figures 7 . 5 , 7 . 6 and 7 . 7 ) . And when our 2 - D system has more than one ﬁxed point ( see Figures 7 . 6 and 7 . 7 ) , this means that wg 2 ( wg in cell two ) will be non - zero at steady state . If we are to see either wild - type or ubiquitous expression of wg , this non - zero value must be su ﬃ ciently big to be classed as “on” . Given this were the case , we could distinguish our two behaviours ( wild - type wg , ubiquitous wg ) by the behaviour of wg in the other cells ( one , three and four ) in which our initial value is ( wg , IWG ) = ( 0 . 001 , 0 . 001 ) . If this value were in the attracting region of our non - zero ﬁxed point , ubiquitous wg expression would result and , if not , we would see wild - type wg expression . How can we determine which of these is the case . When our 2 - D system has three ﬁxed points ( see Fig . 7 . 7 ) , that ﬁxed point with the second highest value of wg is a saddle point , the stable manifold of which separates those parts of the phase plane drawn to the ﬁxed point with the highest value of wg from those parts of the phase plane drawn to the origin . How do we know on which side of this stable manifold our initial value ( wg , IWG ) = ( 0 . 001 , 0 . 001 ) lies ? In our 2 - D system , any non - zero ﬁxed point satisﬁes ( the derivation of which is included as Appendix 10 . 15 ) , wg ν WGwg − α WGwg k (cid:16) α WGwg + 1 (cid:17) wg ν WGwg − 1 + 1 α WGwg + 1 (cid:18) κ WGwg k (cid:19) ν WGwg = 0 ( 7 . 6 ) where k = 1 ( 1 + r ExoWG H IWG ) . If we think of the left hand side ( LHS ) of ( 7 . 6 ) as some function of wg which can be plotted , say f ( wg ) , then zeros of f ( wg ) would locate the non - zero ﬁxed points of our 2 - D system . From ( 7 . 6 ) , we can see that f ( wg = 0 ) is greater than zero and , therefore , if f ( wg = 0 . 001 ) were less than zero , we would 158 know that f ( wg ) has a zero for some value of wg between zero and 0 . 001 ( and 0 . 001 is our initial value of wg in cells one , three and four ) . Thus , a negative value of f ( wg = 0 . 001 ) indicates the existence of a non - zero ﬁxed point in our 2 - D system such that an initial value of ( wg , IWG ) = ( 0 . 001 , 0 . 001 ) lies in the attracting region of the ﬁxed point with the highest value of wg ( see Figures 7 . 6 and 7 . 7 ) . Note 7 . 3 . 3 If this highest value of wg were big enough to be classed as “on” , ubiquitous expression of wg would result at steady state . We propose that this could be conﬁrmed by the values of f ( wg ) for wg equals 0 . 001 , 0 . 1 and one . If both f ( 0 . 001 ) and f ( 0 . 1 ) were negative , but f ( 1 ) were positive , we could conclude that our 2 - D system had three ﬁxed points , two of which were non - zero ( as the sign of f ( wg ) changes twice , recalling that f ( wg = 0 ) is positive - see ( 7 . 6 ) ) . Given f ( wg ) would have two zeros in all here , negative values of both f ( 0 . 001 ) and f ( 0 . 1 ) would show that f ( wg ) had only one zero for wg ∈ [ 0 , 0 . 1 ] . As such , the ﬁxed point with the highest non - zero value of wg would have a value of wg greater than , or equal to , 0 . 1 and could be classed as “on” ( see Fig . 7 . 9 ) . When the saddle point is located su ﬃ ciently close to the origin of our 2 - D system ( with three ﬁxed points ) , ubiquitous expression of wg emerges . The steeper our IWG nullcine , the closer our saddle point is to the origin . From ( 7 . 4 ) , we see that our IWG nullcline is steeper for smaller values of r ExoWG H IWG . Similarly , the more “squashed” our wg nullcline is into the lower half of the phase plane , the closer our saddle point is to the origin . From ( 7 . 5 ) , we see that our wg nullcline is more squashed into the lower half of the phase plane for smaller κ WGwg , bigger α WGwg and smaller ν WGwg . May our reader note that the parameter trends most suited to ubiquitous wg expression are the exact opposite to those most suited to an ubiquitous absence of wg expression . Summary 7 . 3 . 2 In our 2 - D system with three ﬁxed points , ubiquitous wg expression is more ( less ) likely for smaller ( larger ) values of r ExoWG , smaller ( larger ) values of H IWG , smaller ( larger ) values of κ WGwg , larger ( smaller ) values of α WGwg and smaller ( larger ) values of ν WGwg . 159 IWG wg 0 0 . 001 0 . 001 IWG = wg Figure 7 . 9 : The gradient of our IWG nullcline is less than one - see ( 7 . 5 ) - so any intersection of nullclines must take place below the line IWG = wg . Thus , a negative value of f ( 0 . 001 ) indicates the existence of a non - zero ﬁxed point ( as indicated by an intersection of nullcines in the shaded region above ) . If , in addition , values of f ( 0 . 1 ) and f ( 1 ) are negative and positive respectively , the non - zero ﬁxed point in the shaded region is a saddle point , the stable manifold which splits the phase plane and ubiquitous expression of wg follows at steady state ( for our ICs ) . 7 . 3 . 5 Signiﬁcance of 2 - D system Can we use any of these ﬁndings ( relating to our 2 - D system ) in our wg sub - system ? Yes , if our 2 - D system gives rise to ubiquitous expression of wg for some set of parameters ( as can be conﬁrmed by the value of function f ( wg ) for di ﬀ erent values of wg - see Note 7 . 3 . 3 ) , those same parameters must give rise to ubiquitous wg expression in our wg sub - system too . Let us explain . Our 2 - D system was born of a decoupling between EWG and IWG nodes in our wg sub - system . But what e ﬀ ect did this coupling have in our wg sub - system ? Consider the expression for IWG at steady state ( in our wg sub - system ) , derived from ( 7 . 2 ) , IWG i = wg i ( 1 + r ExoWG H IWG ) + r EndoWG H IWG EWG i , T ( 1 + r ExoWG H IWG ) . ( 7 . 7 ) By comparing ( 7 . 7 ) with its analogue in our 2 - D system - see ( 7 . 3 ) - it is clear that the e ﬀ ect of the coupling that was discounted in our 2 - D system ( that between EWG and IWG as shown in ( 7 . 7 ) ) is both positive and additive . As such , the coupling between EWG and IWG cannot decrease concentrations of IWG . Hence , any set of parameters which causes ubiquitous wg expression in our 2 - D system ( as indicated by values of f ( wg ) - see Note 7 . 3 . 3 ) must also cause ubiquitous expression of wg in our wg sub - system ( as well as in our SPN and von Dassow’s SPN ) . 160 Note 7 . 3 . 4 Our wg sub - system was born of a decoupling between CI and wg , together with a decoupling between CN and wg ( in ours and von Dassow’s SPN ) . But the e ﬀ ect of these couplings ( the CI / CN - wg link ) on steady state wg is both positive and additive . As such , the CI / CN - wg link cannot decrease concentrations of wg . Hence , any set of parameters which causes ubiquitous wg expression in our 2 - D system ( as indicated by values of f ( wg ) - see Note 7 . 3 . 3 ) must also cause ubiquitous expression of wg in ours and von Dassow’s SPN . Whilst ubiquitous wg expression of our 2 - D system is preserved in our wg sub - system ( as well as in ours and con Dassow’s SPN ) , this is not necessarily the case for an ubiquitous absence of wg expression . Nevertheless , unless a set of parameters causes an ubiquitous absence of wg expression in our 2 - D system , it cannot do so in our wg sub - system , nor in our SPN ( or von Dassow’s SPN ) . Thus , the ﬁndings of our 2 - D system are highly relevant to our wg sub - system , as well as our SPN ( and von Dassow’s SPN ) . Summary 7 . 3 . 3 In our SPN ( and von Dassow’s SPN ) , an ubiquitous ( absence of ) expres - sion of wg is more likely for higher ( lower ) values of r EndoWG ( see ( 7 . 7 ) ) . 7 . 3 . 6 Final note of f ( wg ) It is remarkable to note that only ﬁve parameters ( those on which f ( wg ) depends - see ( 7 . 6 ) ) can be su ﬃ cient to cause the ubiquitous expression of key SP gene wg ( and thus to prevent the characteristic asymmetry of the SPN and , in turn , the wild - type development of a fruit ﬂy ) . Note 7 . 3 . 5 As an appendix , we include some sample data for our wg sub - system . Forty nine of these parameter sets resulted in a ubiquitous expression of wg . Of these , sixteen sets ( around a third ) were predictable in causing ubiquitous wg expression using the value of f ( wg ) ( see Note 7 . 3 . 3 ) . 161 7 . 4 Discussion In an earlier chapter , “Our SPN” , we proposed that our SPN cannot replicate its characteristic asymmetry except when it e ﬀ ectively splits into two independent sub - systems . In this chapter we have analysed one of these sub - systems in isolation , that we may better understand our SPN ( the whole system ) . But were we right to do so - can our SPN be thought of as two independent systems operating in parallel ? As an appendix , we make a probabilistic argument to support the idea that it can . In short , if our SPN can be thought of in this way , then the probability of ﬁnding characteristic asymmetry in our SPN ( which we found to be around 0 . 02 on average - see Note 5 . 4 . 5 ) should be equal to the product of , P ( absent CI / CN - wg link ) × P ( wild - type wg in sub - system ) × P ( wild - type en in sub - system ) . which we ( conservatively ) estimated as somewhere between 0 . 026 and 0 . 033 based on our ﬁndings ( see Appendix for details ) . In another appendix , we show that a modiﬁed version of our lifting process ( seen in our previous “Our SPN” chapter ) can be used to combine two good parameter sets ( those associated to wild - type en in our en sub - system and to wild - type wg in our wg sub - system ) to make a single parameter set for our SPN . This single parameter set ( and a restricted CI / CN - wg link ) will generally correspond to a striped solution in our SPN ( in a short test , six out of eight such parameter sets replicated wild - type expression of key SP genes en and wg in our SPN ) . Thus , treating our SPN as two independent sub - systems o ﬀ ers a potentially rich source of striped solutions . Note 7 . 4 . 1 In a series of tests , we found that an average of around one in three randomly chosen parameter sets produced wild - type wg in our wg sub - system , whilst an average of around one in four randomly chosen parameter sets produced wild - type en in our en sub - system ( see Appendix ) . Hence , both sub - systems of our SPN are highly robust to parameter variation . Thus , we propose that their connectivity in our SPN ( the EWG - en and CI / CN - wg links ) prevents a much higher level of robustness in our SPN . 162 7 . 4 . 1 Sample data of our wg sub - system : Parameter trends As an appendix , we have included some sample data associated to our wg sub - system . Do our sample data reﬂect those trends predicted in our previous section ? For example , we predicted that ubiquitous wg expression would be more prevalent for lower values of r ExoWG and higher values of r EndoWG . In the sample data of our wg sub - system , forty nine parameter sets caused ubiquitous expression of key SP gene wg . Note 7 . 4 . 2 Of those forty nine sets , nine had a value of r EndoWG ∈ [ 0 . 001 , 0 . 01 ] , twenty had a value of r EndoWG ∈ [ 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 ] and twenty had a value of r EndoWG ∈ [ 0 . 1 , 1 ] whilst seventeen had a value of r ExoWG ∈ [ 0 . 001 , 0 . 01 ] , seventeen had a value of r ExoWG ∈ [ 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 ] and ﬁfteen had a value of r ExoWG ∈ [ 0 . 1 , 1 ] . Hence , for the ubiquitous expression of wg , our previous section’s predictions are reﬂected in our sample data . However , it is interesting to note that the predicted trend in r EndoWG values is stronger than the predicted trend in r ExoWG values . For an ubiquitous absence of wg expression , we predicted higher values of r ExoWG and lower values of r EndoWG would be more prevalent . In the sample data of our wg sub - system , twenty four parameter sets caused ubiquitous expression of key SP gene wg . Note 7 . 4 . 3 Of those twenty four sets , nine had a value of r EndoWG ∈ [ 0 . 001 , 0 . 01 ] , nine had a value of r EndoWG ∈ [ 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 ] and six had a value of r EndoWG ∈ [ 0 . 1 , 1 ] whilst three had a value of r ExoWG ∈ [ 0 . 001 , 0 . 01 ] , none had a value of r ExoWG ∈ [ 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 ] and twenty one had a value of r ExoWG ∈ [ 0 . 1 , 1 ] . Hence , for an ubiquitous absence of wg expression , our previous section’s pre - dictions are reﬂected in our sample data . However , it is interesting to note that the predicted trend in r ExoWG values is stronger than the predicted trend in r EndoWG values . As we were unable to predict trends in those conditions which harbour wild - type wg , could we look for them in our sample data ( which reﬂects the trends we predicted for both ubiquitous expression of wg and its ubiquitous absence and 163 so might be considered representative of general behaviour ) ? As those trends asso - ciated to ubiquitous wg expression and its ubiquitous absence are entirely opposite ( see Summaries 7 . 3 . 2 and 7 . 3 . 1 ) , we propose that those associated to wild - type wg expression must occupy something of a middle ground . In the sample data of our wg sub - system , thirty three parameter sets maintained the wild - type expression of key SP gene wg . Note 7 . 4 . 4 Of those thirty three sets , ﬁfteen had a value of r EndoWG ∈ [ 0 . 001 , 0 . 01 ] , thirteen had a value of r EndoWG ∈ [ 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 ] and ﬁve had a value of r EndoWG ∈ [ 0 . 1 , 1 ] whilst sixteen had a value of r ExoWG ∈ [ 0 . 001 , 0 . 01 ] , nine had a value of r ExoWG ∈ [ 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 ] and eight had a value of r ExoWG ∈ [ 0 . 1 , 1 ] . Hence , wild - type expression of wg is more prevalent in our wg sub - system for lower values of both r EndoWG and r ExoWG . What about wild - type expression of wg in our SPN ? In previous chapter , “Our SPN” , we related twenty one striped solutions ( parameter sets which caused wild - type expression of en and wg in our SPN ) . The same trends were seen amongst these twenty one parameter sets . Note 7 . 4 . 5 Of those twenty one sets , eight had a value of r EndoWG ∈ [ 0 . 001 , 0 . 01 ] , seven had a value of r EndoWG ∈ [ 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 ] and six had a value of r EndoWG ∈ [ 0 . 1 , 1 ] whilst twelve had a value of r ExoWG ∈ [ 0 . 001 , 0 . 01 ] , ﬁve had a value of r ExoWG ∈ [ 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 ] and four had a value of r ExoWG ∈ [ 0 . 1 , 1 ] . 7 . 5 Conclusion In a previous chapter - see “Our SPN” - we proposed that a major barrier to our SPN’s characteristic asymmetry exists in the restrictive CI / CN - regulation of key SP gene wg . In this chapter , we considered our SPN in the absence of this regulation , from which an independent sub - system of our SPN emerged . The characteristic asymmetry of our SPN cannot emerge unless wild - type expression of key SP gene wg is seen in this sub - system ( which we called our wg sub - system ) . 164 We began by analysing our wg sub - system in the absence of the EWG - to - IWG coupling ( as opposed to the IWG - to - EWG coupling ) from which an independent two - node system emerges within each cell . Behaviour of this dynamical system can be represented geometrically by phase portrait . The relative lie of this phase portrait’s nullclines reveal the mode of wg expression at steady state . And , as these nullclines correspond to mathematical equations , we can infer properties of those equations’ parameters from their lie in the phase plane . We calculate a function , f ( wg ) , whose zeros locate non - zero ﬁxed point values of wg . By plotting this function , we can separate the di ﬀ erent possible steady state behaviours of our two - dimensional system . But to what purpose would it be ? Our interest is with the behaviour of our wg sub - system and more important still is our SPN as a whole . Yet our two - dimensional system is signiﬁcant as parameters which cause an ubiquitous expression of wg must likewise do so in our SPN . And the value of f ( wg ) depends on just ﬁve parameters which means that , together , they are su ﬃ cient to cause the abnormal development of a fruit ﬂy . Lower values of both r ExoWG and r EndoWG are most prevalent amongst those pa - rameter sets which cause wild - type expression of wg in our wg sub - system ( as well as in our SPN as part of a striped solution ) . But it is these two parameters which largely dictate the extent to which IWG and EWG nodes are coupled ( see ODEs in “Wingless sub - system” subsection ) . Lower values of r ExoWG and r EndoWG describe a weaker coupling between IWG and EWG nodes . Thus , wild - type expression of wg is most prevalent when the two - dimensional system ( studied in this chapter ) emerges as an independent sub - system of our SPN . 7 . 5 . 1 Our next chapter In previous chapters , we have shown what makes the SPN’s characteristic asym - metry both possible and stable . In this chapter , we proposed that this characteristic 165 asymmetry could be far more robust to parameter variation if the CI / CN - wg link were turned o ﬀ in all cells ( equivalent to its absence from our SPN ) . In our next chapter , we question the legitimacy of this and other parts of our SPN’s architecture . 166 Chapter 8 A new SPN 8 . 1 Introduction Each multi - cellular organism begins life as a single cell . Division of the ﬁrst and subsequent cells equates to development and growth and , ultimately , cells perform di ﬀ erent functions depending on their location . But each cell contains the same DNA and therefore the same genes , so why do they not do the same jobs ? It is our understanding that the proteins synthesised within a cell dictate its role within an organism . Proteins are synthesised according to the group of genes transcribed , which varies from cell to cell . Behaviour of the SPN , it is believed , can be charac - terised by four cells , a tiling of which is broadly representative of Nature [ 1 ] . It seems logical that each of these cells is , in some way , distinct , i . e . serves some purpose otherwise unprovided . Were this the case , the genes expressed in each of the four cells would be di ﬀ erent . Key SP genes wg and en are expressed only in the second and third cell of our four - cell SPN segment respectively [ 1 ] , making those cells distinct . But what about the ﬁrst and fourth cells ? The ci gene is expressed in those cells where en is not expressed , so it does not make distinct the ﬁrst and fourth cells either . It is the wild - type pattern of the ptc gene which tells us that these two cells do not play the same role within our SPN . 167 8 . 1 . 1 Overview x ACT REP Figure 8 . 1 : We want a cooperative control , where repressor REP does not dominate . We have never found a single parameter set which replicates wild - type expres - sion of all products of SP genes in our SPN - why not ? What is wrong with our model ? Our SPN has tendencies to negative control which prejudices its output . We demonstrate this by showing that , even when conditions ( parameters ) are cho - sen to avoid any bias of control , SP genes are still expressed as if under negative control ( turned on when repression is inactive and o ﬀ when it is active ) . We examine the consequences of negative control in our SPN - certain couplings seem to have greater inﬂuence than others over its outcome ( patterns of expres - sion ) . An hierarchy emerges . But how should genes respond to regulation ? Say we have some gene , x , regulated by an inducer , ACT , and a repressor , REP ( see Fig 8 . 1 ) . We want an SPN in which x is only turned on when ACT is active . Furthermore , the concentration of x should only reach signiﬁcant levels if REP is inactive . Apart from issues of control , what else is wrong with our SPN ? Joint regulation of key SP gene wg by CI and CN places major restrictions on SPN conditions ( reﬂected by the limited region of parameter - space from which associated parameters , e . g . κ CIwg were selected for striped solutions ) . Yet this joint regulation has provided a gateway between the two sub - systems of our SPN ( for striped solutions , nodes of the wg sub - system and en sub - system have patterns of expression which are symmetrical in cell two and three of the four - cell segment respectively ) . In this way , the CI / CN - wg link has been a key to our SPN’s characteristic asymmetry . 168 However , this characteristic asymmetry was ﬂawed as it did not feature wild - type ptc . And yet , wild - type patterns of ptc expression are symmetrical about both cells two and three of our SPN - as such , ptc presents itself as an obvious gateway between our wg sub - system and our en sub - system ( see Fig . 8 . 2 ) . Is ptc the real key to the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry ? Other ﬂaws of our SPN are exposed throughout the chapter but , as we remove ﬂawed links from our SPN , gaps are left behind . We propose what might ﬁll these gaps . symmetry ( around cells two and four ) symmetry ( around cells one and three ) symmetry ( around cells one , two , three and four ) wg ptc en , hh , ci Figure 8 . 2 : Could ptc replace CI and CN as a pivot between sub - systems in our SPN ? Wild - type expression of ptc is symmetrical about every cell of the four - cell segment . 8 . 1 . 2 Premiss When a system fails to perform its task , how do we ﬁnd the origin of its failure ? And if the system can be thought of as a network ( as is the case with our SPN ) where everything is connected , what does it even mean to talk about an “origin” ? As we go on to demonstrate , our SPN is negatively controlled , which results in a hi - erarchy . As a consequence of this hierarchy , some parts of the network ( parts being mRNAs , proteins and the links between them ) are far more likely to be “origins” of problems ( such as those which preventing our SPN’s characteristic asymmetry ) . In this way , we identify obvious ﬂaws in our SPN model in the ﬁrst part of this chapter . In the second part of this chapter , we propose a new SPN model , using a “ﬁll - ing the gaps” method of model / network building . That is , when a gap emerges in 169 our network ( based on an absence of knowledge ) , let us suppose the gap is ﬁlled by some node - what properties would such a node have ? Suppose a target gene x has two regulators ACT and REP ( as in Fig . 8 . 1 ) , we propose x ’s mode of expression should be an overlap / combination of its regulators’ modes of expression . We claim no superior biological knowledge over our peers . Our foremost aim is to build a new SPN model which enables wild - type expres - sion of all SP nodes . But we also try to ﬁnd a better mechanism for the transition between two sets of nodes - those whose wild - type expression is symmetrical in cells one and three of the SPN segment ( e . g . en , hh , ci and ptc ) and those whose wild - type expression is symmetrical in cells two and four ( e . g . wg and ptc ) . Aside 8 . 1 . 1 Wild - type expression of ptc takes the form (cid:0) o f f , on , o f f , on (cid:1) [ 1 ] . Von Dassow et al . proposed cubitus interruptus proteins , CI and CN , in answer to this ( where products of the engrailed gene regulate the cubitus interruptus gene , whose proteins in turn regulate the wingless gene ) . But we have found this proposed transition between our wg sub - system and our en sub - system to be antagonistic - CI and CN nullify each other’s regulation of wg ( for striped solutions ) . Thus , the e ﬀ ect of this CI / CN - wg link would have been achieved , and at a lower cost to the system , by its absence . 8 . 2 Negative control Genes are just sequences of DNA , a reference point for protein manufacture . When an organism needs more of some protein , copies of the gene are made in the form of of RNA . This process needs regulation ; too much protein is ine ﬃ cient ( as protein decays ) whereas too little risks a cell’s ability to perform its designed function . Proteins ( such as so - called transcription factors ) are regulators of mRNA synthe - sis . In prokaryotic cells ( those without a true nucleus , e . g . bacteria ) there are two types of regulation , called positive control and negative control . With the former , 170 a particular protein’s presence is required to facilitate transcription of a ( target ) gene . Proteins in negative control systems prevent a target gene’s transcription when present ( a gene is transcribed only in the protein’s absence ) . Fruit ﬂies are eukaryotes yet , such is the structure of von Dassow’s ODEs , that transcription leans towards negative control . When a repressor is deactivated in von Dassow’s ( and our ) SPN , the target gene is turned on unless the inducer is deactivated and / or induction is impotent . When a repressor is active in von Dassow’s ( and our ) SPN , concentration of the target gene is low unless repression is highly impotent and / or induction is weak . Thus , repression decides a gene’s fate , except in extreme opposition , much like a negatively controlled system . Note 8 . 2 . 1 In our “Stripes” chapter , we saw that key SP gene en relies entirely on its repressor CN to induce en’s wild - type expression . We also saw that key SP gene wg required its repressor CN to squash one of its inducers ( CI ) and that , because CN could not do this when inactive , CI - induction had always to be impotent ( hence our condition on κ CIwg ) . What are the implications of quasi - negative control in our SPN ? Our SPN is a network of connected couplings and , in a negatively controlled system , behaviour of repressor - mRNA couplings largely dictates the overall behaviour of the system . 8 . 2 . 1 Chain reactions What if just one stripeless coupling ( one which takes the same value in all cells ) in our SPN could set o ﬀ a chain reaction ? That is , what if just one stripeless protein - mRNA coupling could cause make other couplings / nodes of our SPN stripeless ? That would make it di ﬃ cult to locate the source of ( and therefore ﬁx ) any genetic malfunction because we would not see misexpression of just one gene product , but of many . Note 8 . 2 . 2 If only one SP gene product were misexpressed , it could be simple to ﬁnd the root of the problem , e . g . in values of parameters associated to its governing ODE . 171 Let us think of our SPN as a system of couplings - those most likely to set o ﬀ a chain reaction are those which represent repression , as negative control ( of the kind we see in our SPN ) uses only repressor proteins . There are four such couplings in our SPN ( the CN - en , CN - wg , CN - ptc and EN - ci links ) . How can we show that any of these couplings are capable of setting o ﬀ chain reactions in our SPN ? Suppose we knew how to make a coupling in our SPN stripeless and how best to avoid a stripeless coupling . In fact , we can do both by ﬁxing those parameters associated to a coupling . Aside 8 . 2 . 1 In our SPN , a coupling which represents repression ( of the kind we focus upon here ) has the general form , f ( REP i ) = (cid:32) κ ν R x REPx κ ν REPx REPx + REP ν REPx i (cid:33) ( 8 . 1 ) where REP i is some repressor of target gene x , κ REPx is the potency and ν REPx is the cooper - ativity of said repression . Such a coupling is ideally placed both to turn its target gene x on in some cell ( s ) and o ﬀ in some other cell ( s ) when κ REPx ( which takes values between 0 . 001 and one ) is of medium value , say 0 . 01 , and ν REPx ( which take values between one and ten ) is of maximum value , ten . These sizes of parameters allow f ( REP i ) to be both big ( when REP i is small ) and small ( when REP i is big ) . This is how we best avoid a stripeless coupling . But how do we make a coupling stripeless ? We give κ REPx its maximum value and ν REPx its minimum value . Under these conditions , small values of REP i would make f ( REP i ) big but so too would big values of REP i . For parameters not associated to couplings of the form ( 8 . 1 ) , we make all κ ACTx ( which take values between 0 . 001 and one ) equal to 0 . 01 , all ν ACTx ( which take values between one and ten ) equal to 10 , all half - lives H ( which takes values between ﬁve and one hundred ) ﬁfty , all rates r ( which takes values between 0 . 001 and one ) equal to 0 . 01 , both capacities α ( which take values between one and ten ) equal to ﬁve and C CI ( which takes values between 0 . 001 and one ) equal to 0 . 1 . Now , let us show how we can use this technique both to demonstrate the chain reaction e ﬀ ect caused by couplings of the form ( 8 . 1 ) in our SPN and the negative control which , in part , provokes it . 172 8 . 2 . 2 Main SPN spectrum We highlighted the four couplings we believe most likely to set o ﬀ a chain reac - tion - those linking repressor proteins and mRNA nodes in our SPN . Using the parameter - ﬁxing technique described above , we can make each of these four cou - plings ( the CN - en , CN - wg , CN - ptc and EN - ci links ) stripeless or we can give them the best chance of being striped ( big value in some cell ( s ) and small in others ) . Thus , each coupling is given one of two states , giving sixteen ( 2 4 ) possible overall states for the system . We run our SPN model for each of the sixteen . If our SPN is negatively con - trolled ( as we propose ) then , together , these sixteen simulations should capture the main spectrum of SPN - behaviour . We ﬁnd that some of the sixteen produce the same behaviour . This is a result , we believe , of a chain reaction , i . e . one stripeless coupling making ( an ) other coupling ( s ) stripeless . Let v be the vector of couplings , ( CN - en , CN - wg , CN - ptc , EN - ci ) and s be the associated state thereof , i . e . stripeless or ( given the best chance of being ) striped . For example , s = ( b , o , b , o ) would represent our SPN where the CN - en and CN - ptc couplings were made stripeless , but where all others ( including WG - en , WG - wg , CI - wg , CI - ptc , B - ci and PTC - CI ) were given the best chance of being striped . We present a short summary of our sixteen states as a table . Note 8 . 2 . 3 In the third column of our table , “No sym . ” indicates that every mRNA and every protein in our SPN had a stripeless mode of expression , i . e . had either ubiquitously high or ubiquitously low values . The en sub - system is the collection of nodes - en , ci , CI , CN , ptc - and the links between them in our SPN . The wg sub - system is the collection of nodes - wg , IWG , EWG - and the links between them in our SPN . 173 s Symmetry ( sym . ) of behaviour in our SPN 1 ( o , o , o , o ) 3rd cell sym . everywhere 2 ( b , o , o , o ) No sym . 3 ( o , b , o , o ) 3rd cell sym . in en sub - system , none in wg sub - system 4 ( o , o , b , o ) ptc has no sym . , 3rd cell sym . elsewhere 5 ( o , o , o , b ) No sym . 6 ( b , b , o , o ) No sym . 7 ( o , b , b , o ) ptc , wg & IWG have no sym . , 3rd cell sym . elsewhere 8 ( o , o , b , b ) No sym . 9 ( b , o , b , o ) No sym . 10 ( o , b , o , b ) No sym . 11 ( b , o , o , b ) No sym . 12 ( o , b , b , b ) No sym . 13 ( b , o , b , b ) No sym . 14 ( b , b , o , b ) No sym . 15 ( b , b , b , o ) No sym . 16 ( b , b , b , b ) No sym . Notice ( from this table ) that three quarters of these sixteen states result in a “No sym . ” outcome , i . e . every node in our SPN has a stripeless mode of expression . This is a startling observation if the sixteen states in this table represent the main spectrum of our SPN’s behaviour ( as we claim ) . How might we support this claim ? By comparing the average behaviour found in our SPN ( see “Our SPN” chapter ) with Figure 8 . 3 ( in which results are shown in fuller detail than in this table ) . For example , in our “Our SPN” chapter , we found that on average almost half of all parameter sets resulted in the ubiquitous expression of both key SP genes , en and wg , in our SPN . Similarly , Figure 8 . 3 shows that , for eight out of our six - teen states ( half ) , both en and wg were ubiquitously expressed . The second most prominent behaviour of key SP genes in our SPN is wild - type en coupled with 174 ubiquitous wg expression ( see “Our SPN” ) , found on average for one ﬁfth of all parameter sets in our SPN . Similarly , Figure 8 . 3 shows that this type of behaviour is seen in four of our sixteen states ( a quarter ) . Note 8 . 2 . 4 Wild - type expression of key SP gene wg is not seen for any of our sixteen states ( see Fig . 8 . 3 ) . And as we did not restrict the CI / CN - wg link ( using associated parameters ) , we expected nothing else . Thus , Figure 8 . 3 captures the most prominent trends of behaviour in our SPN . As Figure 8 . 3 shows the results of adjusting the state of repressor - mRNA couplings only , its ability to capture the main spectrum of our SPN suggests that the state of repressor - mRNA couplings largely dictates the behaviour of our SPN . This is indicative of a negatively controlled system . Note 8 . 2 . 5 Case one ( see top left hand corner of Figure 8 . 3 ) describes that state of our SPN in which the parameters associated to all protein - mRNA couplings were chosen to give them the best chance of being striped . The outcome exempliﬁes negative control - expression of each of the target genes en , ptc and ci is the compliment of its repressor ( wg did not behave in this way as it has three , rather than two , regulating proteins , giving its ODE a di ﬀ erent structure ) . Before we propose an improved SPN model , we further analyse the results shown in Figure 8 . 3 . Why ? Although the quasi - negative control we see in our SPN is misplaced , there are many organisms for which it is not ( e . g . for some prokaryotes ) . Elaboration here could help research into such organisms . We can show that there is a sense of order within Figure 8 . 3 . 8 . 2 . 3 Solitaire Some of the sixteen states shown in Figure 8 . 3 share the same the same type of outcome ( e . g . states two and six ) . We go on to group such outcomes together in the same columns of an ordered arrangement ( see Fig . 8 . 4 ) . Recall that , for Figure 8 . 3 , each repressor - mRNA coupling in our SPN was given one of two states 175 en : wild - type IWG / wg : ON ev . ptc : en - type ci : wild - type CN / CI : ci - type 1 2 3 6 7 8 9 11 12 14 15 16 13 10 4 5 ptc / IWG wg / en : ON ev .

We may refer to these states simply as sabotaged or non - sabotaged from now on . Note 8 . 2 . 6 The table of our previous subsection shows the behaviour of states one , three , four and seven to be distinct . Thus , these states do not share the same type of outcome as any other , however it may appear in Figure 8 . 3 . Is there any order within the columns of Figure 8 . 4 themselves ? We think of the top case of each column as the representative ( of that column ) and , more generally , higher elements as more representative than those below . For example , state two goes at the top of the second column because states lower in the same column ( states six , nine and ﬁfteen ) are , in a sense , sub - cases of case two . How so ? All four states have in common one sabotaged coupling - state two had only this one sabotaged coupling . As we have seen in our previous subsection ( see table and Fig . 8 . 3 ) , the following states , s = ( b , o , o , o ) − state 2 s = ( b , b , o , o ) − state 6 s = ( b , o , b , o ) − state 9 s = ( b , b , b , o ) − state 15 share the same type of outcome in our SPN . But why is this so ? We propose that state two actually causes ﬁfteen , i . e . if we sabotage the CN - en coupling ( as in state two ) , the CN - wg and CN - ptc couplings become stripeless too ( as in state ﬁfteen ) . This is the sort of chain reaction we have described previously - the state of the CN - en coupling dominates , or controls , the state of the CN - wg and CN - ptc couplings . Moreover , we believe this to exemplify an intrinsic hierarchy of couplings in our SPN ( where the CN - en coupling is above the CN - wg and CN - ptc couplings ) . We can determine a full hierarchy using Figure 8 . 4 - its second column is the biggest , so it must have the most powerful representative of all the columns . Only 177 one coupling was sabotaged in the second column’s representative , the CN - en cou - pling . Thus , the CN - en coupling should be uppermost in our hierarchy as , when it is sabotaged , the scale of the chain reaction which ensues is greatest . Second highest in our hierarchy must be the EN - ci coupling - how do we know ? Several columns are joint second biggest in Figure 8 . 4 so they must have the second most powerful representatives . These representatives all have multiple sabotaged cou - plings , except for the ﬁfth column’s whose representative has a sabotaged EN - ci coupling only . Of the other two repressor - mRNA couplings in our SPN ( CN - wg and CN - ptc ) neither can dominate , but can be dominated by , other couplings in our hierarchy . We place the one dominated less frequently above its counterpart in our hierarchy . Columns two and ﬁve of Figure 8 . 4 show that the CN - wg coupling ( but not the CN - ptc coupling ) is dominated by both the CN - en and EN - ci couplings respectively . Therefore , the CN - wg coupling is lowest in our hierarchy , as shown CN − en EN − ci CN − ptc CN − wg Let us recapitulate . We believe our SPN is quasi - negatively controlled such that couplings representing repression have greatest inﬂuence over behaviour in our SPN . What we have found here is that , even within this inﬂuential group of cou - plings , some are more inﬂuential than others . For instance , the CN - en coupling can largely dictate behaviour in our SPN via a sort of chain reaction . That is , if CN - repression of key SP gene en is stripeless , it may not be just en that is a ﬀ ected - it is , on average , felt throughout our SPN . 178 1 2 15 9 6 3 4 5 10 7 8 12 7 13 11 14 16 1 ) s = ( o , o , o , o ) 2 ) s = ( b , o , o , o ) 3 ) s = ( o , b , o , o ) 4 ) s = ( o , o , b , o ) 5 ) s = ( o , o , o , b ) 6 ) s = ( b , b , o , o ) 7 ) s = ( o , b , b , o ) 8 ) s = ( o , o , b , b ) 9 ) s = ( b , o , b , o ) 10 ) s = ( o , b , o , b ) 11 ) s = ( b , o , o , b ) 12 ) s = ( o , b , b , b ) 13 ) s = ( b , o , b , b ) 14 ) s = ( b , b , o , b ) 15 ) s = ( b , b , b , o ) 16 ) s = ( b , b , b , b ) Figure 8 . 4 : States which share like outcomes placed in same columns , where s is the state of v = ( CN - en , CN - wg , CN - ptc , EN - ci ) . 1 3 4 5 10 2 15 9 6 77 8 12 11 14 13 16 Figure 8 . 5 : Full extent of the order within the sixteen states of Fig . 8 . 3 . 179 8 . 2 . 4 Tree Although our SPN should not be negatively controlled , this kind of behaviour is seen in other organisms . We hope our work here might be useful to research into such organisms . Here , we discuss the full extent of order within Figure 8 . 3 , as shown in Figure 8 . 5 . Figure 8 . 5 is formed by letting the columns of Figure 8 . 4 become horizontally arranged clusters . Clusters are set apart from each other ac - cording to the closeness of their representative . Moving from left to right , the number of sabotaged couplings in a cluster’s representative increases ( an increase of one is indicated by each dashed vertical line - see Fig . 8 . 5 ) . In simple terms , Figure 8 . 5 is a tree diagram . A cluster that is positioned to the immediate right of , and halfway between , two clusters is , in some sense , a combination of the two . For example , state seven has this relationship with states three and four , i . e . state seven has two sabotaged couplings - one of which was sabotaged in state three and the other of which was sabotaged in state four . Case 3 : s = ( o , b , o , o ) Case 4 : s = ( o , o , b , o )  = ⇒ Case 7 : s = ( o , b , b , o ) We feel that the split which emerges from our tree - like arrangement ( see the thick line Fig . 8 . 6 ) suggests this arrangement is both intuitive and natural . 8 . 2 . 5 Hierarchy Why are those couplings uppermost in our SPN hierarchy - i . e . the CN - en and EN - ci couplings - so inﬂuential in our SPN ? The target genes of these two couplings ( ci and en ) are the reference points for our SPN’s repressor proteins ( CN and EN ) ; the vehicles of negative control . In other words , the EN - ci and CN - en couplings regulate the core regulation of our SPN . But what makes the CN - en coupling more inﬂuential than the EN - ci coupling in our SPN ? A protein form of the ci gene ( target of the EN - ci coupling ) , CN , is not the only 180 Zero sabotaged couplings One sabotaged coupling Two sabotaged couplings Three sabotaged couplings CN - ptc coupling sabotaged EN - ci coupling sabotaged CN - en coupling sabotaged CN - wg coupling sabotaged CN - wg CN - ptc EN - ci CN - en CN - wg CN - ptc CN - ptc EN - ci EN - ci CN - en CN - en EN - ci CN - ptc Figure 8 . 6 : Tree in greater detail ( only the representative of each cluster shown ) . Patterns within are highlighted as we identify representatives by sabotaged cou - plings therein . Only clusters above the thick line were able to replicate wild - type en expression . 181 protein form associated to its gene ( CI is also a protein of the ci gene ) . In contrast , EN is the only protein form of the en gene ( target of the CN - en coupling ) . This makes it easier for the CN - en coupling to a ﬀ ect EN than it is for the EN - ci coupling to a ﬀ ect CN . We propose that , in a negatively controlled system , any link between a repressor protein and the mRNA form of another repressor will be the most instrumental in the output of that system . To put it another way , such links will be the source of most misexpression . 8 . 2 . 6 End of part one : Discussion When abnormal behaviour occurs in our SPN , we wish to know its cause . But when many SP gene products are misexpressed simultaneously , it can be di ﬃ cult . We propose that mass misexpression of SP gene products can result from a chain reaction stemming from a single origin ( e . g . some coupling ) . We ﬁnd that the CN - ptc and CN - wg couplings have limited global e ﬀ ects , generally a ﬀ ecting tar - get genes only . Thus , they are unlikely to cause mass misexpression in our SPN and the origin of such things will not be found in parameters associated to these couplings . Misexpression of key SP gene en will generally originate in that frac - tion of parameter - space responsible for the CN - en and EN - ci couplings ( see Fig . 8 . 6 ) . None of our sixteen states resulted in the characteristic asymmetry of our SPN , i . e . wild - type expression of both key SP genes en and wg ( see Fig . 8 . 3 ) . Does this throw into question whether our sixteen states reﬂect the general behaviour of our SPN ? Not really , it only reﬂects how rarely characteristic asymmetry is seen in our SPN . In fact , this result reinforces our belief that a restricted CI / CN - wg link is necessary to characteristic asymmetry ( this restriction was not enforced in our sixteen states ) . And this is the point - our sixteen states were intended to capture the main spectrum of SPN conditions , not restricted conditions . 182 The main spectrum of our SPN ( see Fig . 8 . 3 ) does not capture wild - type ptc ei - ther . In fact , the main spectrum of our SPN has only nine distinct outcomes ( see Fig . 8 . 4 ) and , although our SPN is capable of far more than these nine outcomes , we nevertheless believe that they represent the average behaviour of our SPN . For example , key SP gene wg is always turned on for our sixteen states ( see Fig . 8 . 3 ) . Astonishing at ﬁrst , this is not an unfair reﬂection of what we have seen throughout this piece , i . e . that misexpression of wg is common - place and its most frequent form is ubiquitous . The purpose of this section was two - fold . Firstly , to expose the ﬂaws of our SPN model , which has almost intrinsic barriers against the wild - type expression of SP genes wg and ptc . And secondly , to demonstrate methods of ﬁnding genetic hierarchies which we believe could be practised within models of prokaryotic sys - tems ( where negative control may legitimately oversee the course of events ) . Can we now propose an improved SPN model ? 8 . 3 Alternatives Our SPN behaves in a predominantly negatively - controlled fashion . How might we address this ? We consider this matter ﬁrst before going on to consider a revised architecture for our model . 8 . 3 . 1 Control Despite our reservations , is a system which leans towards negative control nev - ertheless the best approach ? Let us suppose each SP gene is the target of two regulating proteins , one of which attempts to promote , whilst the other seeks to inhibit , expression of the target gene . Should only one of these proteins be present , the e ﬀ ect upon transcription seems intuitive . If the repressor is the one absent , the gene is turned on . If the repressor is the one present , the gene is turned o ﬀ . But this 183 is consistent with negative control ( and positive control , as it happens ) . So what’s wrong with using negative control ? Aside 8 . 3 . 1 Transcription factors induce the expression of a gene by binding to a so - called promoter region of the DNA , upstream of the gene itself . What should happen when both proteins are absent ? This is almost equivalent to asking what the default state of the target gene should be . Under negative control , the default state is ON but we do not believe this should be the case ) . Without induction , we believe transcription levels of a gene should remain low . Finally , what should when both proteins are present ? On the one hand , a protein has bound to the DNA which catalyses transcription . On the other hand , a di ﬀ erent protein has also bound to the DNA blocking transcription . Or perhaps the binding of one prevents that of the other where it is a race - to - bind between transcription factors ? Where the slower attempts to dislodge the faster ? The desired outcomes of the ﬁrst two of our four general scenarios ( induction but no repression , repression but no induction , no induction and no repression , induction and repression ) are consistent with both positive control and negative control . The third is consistent only with positive control . Ideally then , for the sake of simplicity , our fourth scenario would also be consistent with positive con - trol . What would this imply ? An active repressor would be unable to prevent transcription in the presence of an active inducer . But if the default position of the target gene is OFF ( as we have suggested it should be here ) does it not follow that the onus is on conditions to be ideal before they are turned on ? We propose that substantial transcription of any SP gene ( such that we may term it ON ) should not take place in the face of active repression . Furthermore , it needs catalysis to overcome its default OFF position and therefore only one of our four scenarios ( induction but no repression ) should result in signiﬁcant copying of an SP gene in the form of an mRNA . Since neither positive nor negative control fully 184 describes the SPN , how do we model it ? We propose the negative control of our SPN is a result of the structure of its associated ODEs . To move away from negative control then , we need to alter this structure . Recall , this negative control manifests ( via Hill functions ) in the expression patterns of mRNAs in our SPN . We look to the ODEs associated to mRNAs to explain control . The exponents in von Dassow’s ( and our ) ODEs accentuate the impact of repres - sion upon the target gene , leading to a quasi - negative control . In the ODEs which monitor levels of mRNA concentration , there are bracketed terms , representing re - pression . Each such term has an exponent , ν ACTx , which accentuates the di ﬀ erence between levels of repression and strength of induction . Aside 8 . 3 . 2 In our SPN , ODEs which govern mRNA concentrations generally have the form , dx i d τ = T 0 H x  ACT i (cid:18) κ ν REPxREPx κ ν REPxREPx + REP ν REPxi (cid:19) ν ACTx κ ν ACTx ACTx + ACT i (cid:18) κ ν REPxREPx κ ν REPxREPx + REP ν REPxi (cid:19) ν ACTx − x i  . To shift the emphasis of our model , we must remove , add or move exponents in such ODEs . Let us try moving an exponent , ν ACTx , from the bracketed term to inducer , ACT i , to give the ODEs associated to mRNAs a new general form , dx i d τ = T 0 H x  ACT ν ACTx i (cid:18) κ ν REPxREPx κ ν REPxREPx + REP ν REPxi (cid:19) κ ν ACTx ACTx + ACT ν ACTx i (cid:18) κ ν REPxREPx κ ν REPxREPx + REP ν REPxi (cid:19) − x i  . Instead of an dictatorial repressor , REP i , this ODE form resulted in an ine ﬀ ec - tive one , i . e . active repression seldom resulted in a target gene being turned o ﬀ . However , we found that a combination of this form and its predecessor gave the desired result . This new general form for those ODEs which govern levels of mRNA concentration is , dx i d τ = T 0 H x    ACT ν ACTx i (cid:18) κ ν REPxREPx κ ν REPxREPx + REP ν REPxi (cid:19) ν ACTx κ ν ACTx ACTx + ACT ν ACTx i (cid:18) κ ν REPxREPx κ ν REPxREPx + REP ν REPxi (cid:19) ν ACTx − x i      . ( 8 . 2 ) Let us summarise this subsection . 185 Summary 8 . 3 . 1 Our SPN model generally behaves like a negatively controlled system . If expression of a gene , x , is induced by a protein , ACT , and repressed by another protein , REP , there are four general rules of control . ACT on + REP on = x o f f ACT on + REP o f f = x on ACT o f f + REP on = x o f f ACT o f f + REP o f f = x on We propose that these rules are unsatisfactory for a eukaryotic organism such as a fruit ﬂy . We propose the following rules of control for an improved SPN model . ACT on + REP on = x o f f ACT on + REP o f f = x on ACT o f f + REP on = x o f f ACT o f f + REP o f f = x o f f ( low levels ) These rules of control seen in other famous regulatory networks such as the lac operon in Escherichia Coli and the GAL regulon in yeast [ 10 ] . They are also the rules derived from the logical rules of the SPN model devised by Albert and Othmer [ 21 ] . Having solved the problem of control , what else is wrong with our SPN model ? 8 . 3 . 2 Time Before we consider the exact architecture of our improved model , we must ﬁrst address the nature of Time and its e ﬀ ects within an organism . Many biological processes depend upon proteins which , in turn , depend upon the transcription of genes . These are ordered events . A protein cannot be made without RNA , but this RNA copy of a gene was made at an earlier point in Time . Furthermore , making this RNA may have involved another protein and the same issues arise . Note 8 . 3 . 1 These issues may not arise in negatively controlled prokaryotic organisms . One might argue that each new cell contains the organism’s DNA and an absence of 186 protein would cause genes to be expressed and translation of protein would ensue . Some proteins are made sooner than others and these could block the transcription of other genes , thus a self - regulating organism would be made and could ﬂourish . Let us think of an optimal state of the SPN as the culmination of a chain of events in Time , e . g . Event A → Event B → Event C → . . . → Event Z where we think of Time as linear , progressing from left to right . But any loop in the network equates to a paradox in this type of progression such that , for example , Event F has some part in causing ( earlier ) Event D . However , what alternative do we have to a network with loops ? Something must have caused the ﬁrst event and , if not another event ( which would create a loop ) , then what ? Biologists might sug - gest “the environment” whilst physicists might say “energy” . But these amount to the same thing , i . e . an outside entity acting independently of , but invading , an organism’s frame of Time . An example of such an entity would be the ﬁxed basal energy ( dummy node B ) which has induced ci - transcription in von Dassow’s SPN . Hence , perhaps an extensive use of dummy nodes could help avoid the need for loops in a network . Further incentive for such a network - the more loops present in a network , the longer Matlab takes to run the associated model . Note 8 . 3 . 2 As an organism evolves , optimising mechanisms involving feedback loops may develop . Once this happens , the scenario outlined above could cease to be paradoxical . 8 . 4 Design We are ﬁnally ready to discuss the architecture of a new SPN model . It is the machinery underpinning the characteristic asymmetry which interests us . We must understand this aspect before other details of the system can follow . Our approach 187 - use the knowledge which exists to infer that which does not . Participation of unknown nodes is implied by the gaps left when we use only what is recognised as fact . Note 8 . 4 . 1 This mirrors a process favoured in the Biology community . The presence of transcription factors can be deduced if current knowledge of an organism is insu ﬃ cient to fully explain its function . This method is sometimes called “ﬁlling in the gaps” [ 10 ] . When it comes to the SPN , what are the facts ? Principally , that molecular signals between di ﬀ erent cell types maintain the characteristic asymmetry of the SPN . 8 . 4 . 1 Signals At the posterior of each SPN parasegment , we ﬁnd the wg domain ( cell in which wild - type expression of key SP gene wg is seen , cell two of our four - cell segment ) from which active wingless protein di ﬀ uses to surrounding cells , which include the anterior of each adjacent parasegment . At the anterior , we ﬁnd the en / hh domain ( cells in which wild - type expression of key SP genes en and hh is seen , cell three of our four - cell segment ) . From this domain , active hedgehog protein , HH , di ﬀ uses to surrounding cells , including the wg domain [ 1 ] . But how direct are these signals ? For example , does HH bind to the promoter site of wg - is that how this signal works ? In von Dassow’s SPN , the hedgehog signal is received by receptor protein , PTC , which is required for the cleavage of CI into CN . This CN protein represses wg expression and the hedgehog signal has up - regulated wg , albeit in a mediated way . Note 8 . 4 . 2 By binding to PTC in von Dassow’s SPN , HH e ﬀ ectively down - regulates PTC ( as levels of PTC concentration are lowered as a result ) . But the cleaving role of PTC e ﬀ ectively down - regulates CI and up - regulates CN . So PTC has down - regulated wg - inducer CI and up - regulated wg - repressor CN . In e ﬀ ect , PTC has down - regulated wg and , since HH has down - regulated PTC , we say that HH has e ﬀ ectively up - regulated wg . Incidentally , this role of PTC ( down - regulating wg ) was suggested by Ingham et al . [ 25 ] . 188 It seems then that von Dassow et al . perfectly installed the HH signal into their SPN model - even incorporating Ingham’s proposed role of PTC in relation to wg [ 25 ] . But , in von Dassow’s SPN , PTC performs this role by up - regulating cleavage of CI into CN , how can this be so ? If it were , surely the product of cleavage , CN , would be active in the PTC domain , but this is not seen in Nature . Note 8 . 4 . 3 The PTC domain is deﬁned as the cells in which wild - type PTC is active . Wild - type expression of PTC is ( o f f , on , o f f , on ) , whilst wild - type expression of CN is ( on , o f f , o f f , o f f ) [ 1 ] . Thus , wild - type CN is inactive in the PTC domain . We need to reconsider this aspect of the model . This is to be our approach in building an improved model - use von Dassow’s SPN as a template , changing only those parts which raise concern under scrutiny . If PTC does not up - regulate the cleaving of CI into CN , we need an alternative . 8 . 4 . 2 Cleavage of CI into CN A product of the cubitus interruptus gene , mRNA copies of ci are made in the non - en domain and used in the manufacture of CI protein . Thus , CI is made in the entire non - en domain , yet there are parts of the non - en domain where wild - type CI is not found . Why not ? Because in some cells ( and not others ) CI is cleaved to make CN instead . What does this cleaving ? Note 8 . 4 . 4 Wild - type expression of ci takes the form ( on , on , o f f , on ) , whilst wild - type expression of CI takes the form ( o f f , on , o f f , on ) [ 1 ] . Let us suppose that there is some protein , say X , on whose presence ( or absence ) CI - cleavage depends . Cleavage must take place in the CN domain ( where wild - type CN is present ) . Thus , the possibilities for X are , X =     ( ON , OFF , OFF , OFF ) or ( ON , OFF , ON , OFF ) if cleavage requires presence of X ( OFF , ON , ON , ON ) or ( OFF , ON , OFF , ON ) if cleavage requires absence of X . Cleavage may be positively controlled or negatively controlled by X . If positive , wild - type expression patterns of X would either need to match those of CN or that 189 of another protein hereto unseen . If negative , there are three familiar nominees for X - an HH signal , same - cell cumulative PTC ( or PH ) or CI . Note 8 . 4 . 5 For cleavage to take place only when the uncleaved protein , CI , were absent would be a paradox . Therefore X is deﬁnitely not CI . But there is also a forth , less familiar , candidate . Smoothened protein SMO is a possibility presented by Albert and Othmer in [ 21 ] and , indeed , it was used to down - regulate cleavage . Note 8 . 4 . 6 Wild - type expression of SMO takes the form (cid:0) o f f , on , on , on (cid:1) [ 21 ] . 8 . 4 . 3 Regulation of en The nature of the HH signal and , more broadly , regulation of key SP gene wg needs more thought . But what about regulation of another key SP gene en ? Von Dassow et al . , Ma et al . and Ingolia all seem to agree that the wingless signal directly induces en [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 7 ] . However , this wingless signal ( represented by a connection between neighbouring - cell EWG and en ) also acts outside the en domain . Hence , the wingless signal needs to be blocked in the non - en domain ( to prevent over - expression of en ) . Note 8 . 4 . 7 In wild - type conditions , the EWG - signal should take the form (cid:0) on , on , on , o f f (cid:1) . In von Dassow’s SPN , CN represses en but wild - type CN is unable to block the wingless signal . But suppose there is some protein , say Z , which is able to block the wingless signal . Thus , the possibilities for Z are , Z = ( on , on , o f f , o f f ) or ( on , on , o f f , on ) neither of which look like the wild - type expression pattern of any protein we have seen . At this stage , we have no feeling as to which we should use . Perhaps , a return to wg - regulation could help us decide . 190 8 . 4 . 4 Regulation of wg When von Dassow et al . ﬁrst attempted to model the SPN , wg had two regula - tors , CI and CN , but when they found that wild - type wg expression could not be achieved , a positive feedback loop between wg and IWG was invoked [ 1 ] . We be - lieve this IWG - wg link was inferred under a false pretence ; simply compensating for the ﬂawed CI / CN - wg connection . But how do we model wg - regulation ? To this point , we have used the expression of a target gene’s known regulator to predict that of the unknown other . Where do we start ? Ideally there would be active induction and inactive repression of wg in the wg domain . Elsewhere , active induction must be met with active repression to prevent over - expression of wg . Even so , we are left with possibilities so numerous that they may as well be boundless . If we could invest in one regulator , we could propose its counterpart just as we have done before . Von Dassow et al . , Ma et al . and Ingolia all propose a CI / CN - wg link [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 7 ] , despite its obvious ﬂaws . Perhaps they knew of a link between the ci and wg genes and this was the only way they could accommodate it ? Let us suppose that either CI - induction or CN - repression of wg is well - founded such that wg regulated by one of two pairs ; CI and some protein W or CN and some protein Y where , W = ( o f f , o f f , o f f , on ) , ( o f f , o f f , on , on ) , ( on , o f f , o f f , on ) or ( on , o f f , on , on ) & Y = ( on , on , o f f , o f f ) or ( o f f , on , o f f , o f f ) . With regards to repressor W , none of the modes of expression are familiar . There are two nominees for inducer Y , one of which matches IWG ( previously ruled out ) whilst the other matches one of the possibilities for Z ( en ’s proposed repressor ) . 191 8 . 4 . 5 Versions of X Whichever version of X ( which plays a role in the cleavage of CI ) we choose must be the best ﬁt with available literature . This key process may be negatively con - trolled ( such that it only happens in X ’s absence ) or positively controlled ( such that it only happens in X ’s presence ) . If the latter , there are two candidates for X , the ﬁrst of which matches the expression of CN . Although CN cannot induce its own synthesis , why should X not be a protein with like expression ( EN induces hh and their modes of wild - type expression match ) . The second candidate is unfamil - iar to us and , as such , we do not feel able to say anything in its favour , nor against it . What about a negatively controlled cleavage of CI where X is a repressor ? An obvious candidate for X would be same - cell cumulative PTC . Were PTC to down - regulate cleavage ( up - regulating CI and down - regulating CN ) it would , in e ﬀ ect , up - regulate wg ( whether CI induces wg or CN represses wg ) but this contradicts the ﬁndings of Ingham et al . [ 25 ] . And , if HH were to bind to such a PTC on neigh - bouring cell faces , the hedgehog signal would indirectly down - regulate wg ( as HH down - regulates PTC in binding to it ) which contradicts perceived wisdom [ 1 ] . Thus , same - cell PTC is not an ideal candidate for a repressor X . What about same - cell PH ? Were PH a cleavage repressor , it would be consis - tent with an HH signal which up - regulates wg ( HH up - regulates PH and , as a cleavage - repressor , PH up - regulates wg ) . However , PH is also up - regulated by PTC ( may our reader recall that PH is a complex of PTC and HH ) and so PTC again becomes an up - regulator of wg which contradicts Ingham et al . [ 25 ] . Thus , PH is not an ideal candidate for repressor X either . What about neighbouring - cell HH ? Ingolia used neighbouring - cell HH to repress cleavage [ 7 ] . In our opinion , this is both the simplest and most e ﬀ ective candidate . By repressing cleavage , neighbouring HH up - regulates CI and down - regulates CN . 192 Such an HH signal up - regulates wg thus ( consistent with perceived wisdom of the HH signal ) . But what role would PTC now have ? It would have no role in the SPN except to bind to neighbouring HH , forming PH . This perhaps explains why Ingolia did not include PTC in his model . To conclude , we propose the most ideal candidate for X would an HH signal which down - regulates cleavage . Note 8 . 4 . 8 What’s wrong with SMO ? Absolutely nothing , but its role would be equivalent to HH as the role of SMO is understood to be that of a mediator in the HH signal [ 27 ] . Perhaps SMO is our best candidate then , but using HH directly works equally well . 8 . 4 . 6 Versions of W and Y As we said earlier , regulation of key SP gene wg should accommodate an up - regulating HH - signal . Having just indicated that this signal should repress con - version of CI into CN , which of our proposed forms of wg - regulation ( i . e . CI - induction and W - repression or CN - repression and Y - induction ) ﬁts better ? Both would be consistent as our HH - signal e ﬀ ectively up - regulates potential inducer CI and down - regulates potential repressor CN . We need more information . 8 . 4 . 7 Versions of Z We propose a protein Z for the repression of en ( to replace von Dassow’s use of CN ) . There are two possible modes of wild - type expression for Z . One of these modes matches the form taken by CN for the striped solutions in von Dassow’s SPN , but this was an over - expressed CN ( active in the entire non - en domain ) . But perhaps von Dassow’s model is telling us that such a protein is required ? The second candidate does not look familiar to us . We again need more information . 8 . 4 . 8 Sloppy - paired : A clue ? It is well established that the sloppy - paired gene plays a key role in the SPN’s asymmetric pattern formation . Its protein form , SLP , is believed to both repress en 193 and induce wg [ 3 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 57 ] . The sloppy - paired domain of expression is immedi - ately anterior to the en domain and overlaps with the wg domain [ 22 ] . If the same protein represses en and induces wg , we know that the wild - type expression of our proposed en - repressor Z must match that of wg - inducer ( either CI or Y ) . This is only made possible if , Z = Y = ( on , on , o f f , o f f ) . It stands to reason that this common protein should represent SLP . 8 . 4 . 9 Our new SPN Figure 8 . 7 : Reduced version of our new SPN model , where en and ptc represent en / EN / hh / HH and ptc / PTC respectively ( whilst X and Z are unknown nodes ) . We present our new network with new nodes X and Z ( see Fig . 8 . 7 ) . Both X and Z are unknown nodes here , i . e . they are not neighbouring - cell HH and SLP respectively , though these are the best candidates . The associated ODEs are given as an appendix . 194 8 . 5 End of part two : Discussion Modeling of the SPN has operated under the pre - condition that some genes ( en , wg and hh ) mark out its characteristic behaviour and are therefore the only ones of con - sequence . Flexibility in the expression of other genes and their products has been portrayed as a necessary property in an organism’s battle for survival ( and called robustness ) . If an organism’s physical development remains “normal” despite ge - netic abnormalities , this is an evolutionary advantage . However , to harness and preserve iconic modes of expression found within the SPN should not be enough to validate any model as a whole . In von Dassow’s SPN ( and ours ) , wild - type expression of en relies upon misex - pression elsewhere - over - expressed CN ( in a negatively controlled model , where CN represses en ) is enough to channel the wingless ( EWG ) signal exclusively to the en domain ( cell three of the four - cell segment ) . That is , when CN is active in the entire non - en domain , characteristic asymmetry may emerge . We propose a new repressor of en , Z . Proteins CI and CN are key regulators in the SPN , making it vital that cleav - age of CI protein ( into CN ) is selective . Thus , it must take place only under speciﬁc conditions , i . e . in the presence or absence of some new protein , X . Regulation of wg is , by consensus , linked to CI and CN , but their combined wild - type regulation would result in the over - expression of wg . However , combining one or the other ( CI or CN ) with a new protein could support wild - type wg . We propose that , if wg is repressed by CN , it is induced by a new protein Y ( where CN represses wg ) . 8 . 5 . 1 Results & thoughts We carried out a series of three tests of our new SPN , each consisting of one hundred random parameter sets . Our ﬁrst test yielded eight wild - type solutions ( see Note 8 . 5 . 1 ) , whilst our second yielded thirteen and our third eight again . We 195 no longer look just for wild - type expression of key SP genes en and wg but of all SP genes and their products . Note 8 . 5 . 1 We call parameter sets which replicate wild - type stripes of all nodes in our new SPN model “wild - type solutions” . On average then , about ten out of every one hundred randomly chosen parameter sets result in fully replicated wild - type expression ( which was never seen in von Dassow’s SPN ) . Put in this context , we believe an average hit rate of ten per - cent is quite substantial . Nevertheless , how could this hit - rate be increased ? Perhaps some of the parameter ranges are implausibly wide ? And we model SPN condi - tions ( with parameters ) as though they were identical in all cells . For example , rates of cleavage , di ﬀ usion , decay and binding all occur at the exact same rate in every cell . But why not have a distinct set of parameters for every cell instead ? 8 . 5 . 2 Work of others Let us describe some of the works which played a part in the writing of this chapter . In [ 25 ] , Ingham et al . focus on the role of the ptc gene within the SPN - claiming the patched gene essentially down - regulates key SP gene wg . This down - regulation however is antagonised by the HH - signal . Most interesting of all was their suggestion that PTC itself might be the receptor of this HH - signal , as was the case in von Dassow’s SPN . In [ 8 ] , Ma et al . described how negative links were dominant in both their full SPN model and that of Ingolia . When reducing their full model , they decided to try and combat this by using a di ﬀ erent structure of ODE - the multiplication rule , dx i d τ = T 0 H x (cid:32)(cid:32) κ ν REPx REPx κ ν REPx REPx + REP ν REPx i (cid:33) (cid:32) ACT ν ACTx i κ ν ACTx ACTx + ACT ν ACTx i (cid:33) − x i (cid:33) to denote the time - evolution of target gene x i , induced by ACT i and repressed by REP i . In [ 21 ] , Albert and Othmer used a boolean SPN model in which the logic rules used in its time - evolution dictated that a target gene would not be turned on 196 unless there was both active induction and inactive repression . They used sloppy - paired protein , SLP , both to repress en and induce wg . The pattern of wild - type SLP expression in their model is ( o f f , o f f , on , on ) having numbered cells of their model by their position within parasegments ( whereas we have used segments ) . As such , this pattern is equivalent to the one we have used in this chapter . Finally , Albert and Othmer used smoothened protein , SMO , to down - regulate pro - duction of the repressing form of cubitus interruptus protein ( which they called CIR and we have called CN ) and up - regulate the activating form ( which they called CIA and we have called CI ) . In e ﬀ ect then , SMO down - regulated cleavage of CI into CN . In [ 27 ] , Alcedo et al . use SMO to mediate the HH - signal . In fact , they be - lieve SMO is the receptor of the HH - signal . Although this may seem to contradict Ingham et al . ( who believe PTC is the receptor ) , Alcedo et al . still believe that PTC antagonises the HH - signal . 8 . 6 Conclusion Our SPN had two structural drawbacks - the ﬁrst was general ( in its ODEs ) whilst the second was speciﬁc ( in the wiring of its network ) . Let us begin with the ﬁrst - the structure of ODEs governing levels of mRNA concentration in our SPN makes mRNA levels more sensitive to repression than induction . That is , copying of a gene was more responsive to the presence or absence of down - regulation , much like the negative control seen in some prokaryotes . But a fruit ﬂy is eukaryotic and , as such , the SPN should not be negatively controlled . Adjusting only the state of repressor - mRNA relationships in our SPN produces the most frequent of that model’s behaviour ( which supports a negative control hypothesis ) . This negative control gives our SPN an in - built hierarchy such that some links inﬂuence behaviour more than others . The state of links higher in the hierarchy can a ﬀ ect that of those lower down . Uppermost in this hierarchy is the CN - en link , 197 i . e . CN - repression of en . If a link which is incapable of taking di ﬀ erent values in di ﬀ erent cells is “stripeless” then we ﬁnd , for example , that a stripeless CN - en link e ﬀ ects stripeless CN - ptc and CN - wg links too . We call this a chain reaction ( of misexpression ) set o ﬀ by the stripeless CN - en link . Thus , a stripeless CN - en link may produce the same behaviour in our SPN as three stripeless links ( they being CN - en , CN - ptc and CN - wg ) . But this means a widespread problem ( in which the CN - en , CN - ptc and CN - wg links were stripeless ) could be rectiﬁed by “ﬁxing” just the CN - en link ( i . e . remov - ing the cause of its stripeless state ) . Our hierarchy also tells us that , if key SP gene en were misexpressed , it probably had nothing to do with the CN - ptc or CN - wg links ( or their associated parameters ) as these links cannot set o ﬀ chain reactions ( of mi - sexpression ) . Thus , ﬁnding this type of hierarchy can be very useful . We hope that our methods prove to be of general use , if not in eukaryotes , at least in prokaryotes . Having observed the misplaced quasi - negative control and proposed a remedy ( adjusting the general structure of our ODEs ) we moved onto the speciﬁc archi - tecture of our SPN . We do not wish to dwell on the precise details here so much as to outline our process , which we believe can be used elsewhere . To uncover a system’s architecture , we take the components we know about , assemble them in a manner which supports their roles ( if known ) and recognise that this may not be enough to make the system complete ( refusing to turn something sensible but incomplete into something complete but insensible ) . Though we could assemble our known SP gene products , the resulting network could not support the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry ( simultaneous wild - type expression of key SP genes wg , en and hh ) . Our newly constructed network either needed more nodes or more links . We were able to infer the properties of the miss - ing nodes ( which may or may not be present in our incomplete system ) needed to complete our network . We predicted that the key to completing our new SPN 198 was to use the sloppy - paired gene , slp . Whilst the role of slp may be widely ac - cepted , we hope our reader is not under - whelmed in consequence . Our purpose was not so much to solve the puzzle of the SPN , but to use it as a test case for new approaches to Systems Biology . Furthermore , slp is our best guess in a myriad of possibilities narrowed down by existing knowledge , but there will be times when limited knowledge exists . We hope our methods will help to advance those areas . 199 Chapter 9 Conclusion to thesis Figure 9 . 1 : The SPN , as modeled by von Dassow et al . In this thesis we have presented analytical techniques and applied them to a model of the segment polarity network ( SPN ) proposed by von Dassow et al . in [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] . Figure 9 . 1 shows a digraph representation of this model , which depicts the interaction of gene products from which the SPN’s function - maintaining boundaries between parasegments on a fruit ﬂy’s body - emerges . Deﬁnition of these boundaries is characterised by the expression of certain genes with a stripe of wingless gene ( wg ) expression in the cells immediately anterior to , and a stripe of engrailed / hedgehog gene ( en / hh ) expression in the cells immediately posterior to , each parasegmental boundary . We refer to this wild - type genetic expression as the SPN’s characteristic asymmetry . In [ 1 ] , von Dassow et al . reported that their 200 model of the SPN could replicate this characteristic asymmetry robustly ( under great variation in both initial conditions ( ICs ) and parameter values ) . Our second chapter , “von Dassow’s SPN” , compiles details from various works by von Dassow and colleagues - [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] . But we also do something von Dassow et al . never did - explicitly give an example of conditions which harbour characteristic asymmetry in the SPN model proposed by von Dassow et al . ( we refer to this model as von Dassow’s SPN ) . Our third chapter , “First impressions” , provides our initial thoughts which motivate much of what follows . In our fourth chapter , “Jacobian” , we ask what properties of a good parameter set ( one for which characteristic asymmetry is replicated in von Dassow’s SPN ) allow the SPN’s char - acteristic behaviour to be stably maintained . Figure 9 . 2 : Simpler version of von Dassow’s SPN ( dashed arrows in cell two only ) . The Jacobian matrix , J , associated to von Dassow’s SPN has some degree of sparse - ness , but this sparseness grows signiﬁcantly when a good parameter set , together with the values of SPN nodes under that set , is substituted into J . This increased sparseness turns the big eigenvalue problem associated to J into many small eigen - value problems , each of which can be solved independently . It is interesting to note that this newly sparse J matches the Jacobian matrix associated to a much simpler version of von Dassow’s SPN ( as shown in Figure 9 . 2 ) . Is this how a large 201 connected system ﬁnds stability ? Through such values as give it some kind of equivalence to a simpler system , i . e . one with a lower degree of connectivity ? Figure 9 . 3 : Our SPN : Reduced version of von Dassow’s SPN . In our ﬁfth chapter , “Our SPN” , we proposed a reduced version of von Das - sow’s SPN ( our reduced model is shown in Figure 9 . 3 ) . Our smaller model ( which we refer to as our SPN ) not only has fewer variables , but fewer parameters which allowed us to make swifter parameter surveys . Importantly , our reduction of von Dassow’s SPN is su ﬃ ciently conservative to allow those parameter sets un - der which our SPN replicates simultaneous wild - type expression of key segment polarity ( SP ) genes wg and en to be used as templates for parameter sets under which von Dassow’s SPN replicates characteristic asymmetry . Parameter surveys of our SPN suggest a strong ( positive ) correlation between weak CI - induction of wg and characteristic asymmetry . And , as CN down - regulates CI - induction of wg , we propose that CI / CN - based regulation of wg is e ﬀ ectively absent from the SPN when characteristic asymmetry is replicated . In the absence of the CI / CN - wg link , an independent sub - system emerges within our SPN ( comprising products of key SP gene wg and their interaction ) . 202 Moreover , parameter surveys suggest a negative correlation between weak CN - repression of en and characteristic asymmetry . From this , we infer that CN - repression dominates regulation of en when our SPN replicates characteristic asym - metry and , when it is thus dominated , we propose that EWG - induction of en is e ﬀ ectively absent from our SPN . Hence , parameter surveys suggest that , within each cell , our SPN behaves as two independent sub - systems operating in parallel ( as shown in Figure 9 . 4 ) when its characteristic asymmetry is captured . And nodes within each sub - system have wild - type patterns of expressions symmetrical about the same cell ( those of en , ci , CI , CN , ptc and B are symmetrical about the third cell , whilst those of wg , IWG and EWG are symmetrical about the second cell of our four - cell segment ) . Figure 9 . 4 : Characteristic asymmetry in our SPN : Sub - systems emerge . Thus , parameter surveys of our SPN indicate that its characteristic asymmetry cannot emerge if the wild - type expression of interacting nodes is symmetrical about di ﬀ erent cells . It is this restriction perhaps which makes characteristic asym - metry so much less robust than other forms of expression in our SPN ( parameter surveys of our SPN indicate that an average of almost one in two parameter sets produce the ubiquitous expression of key SP genes en and wg , whilst an average of just one in ﬁfty replicate characteristic asymmetry ) . 203 We propose that , when characteristic asymmetry emerges in our SPN , these key SP genes - en and wg - are regulated exclusively by CN and IWG respectively ( see Fig . 9 . 4 ) . Therefore , the possibility of characteristic asymmetry within our SPN can be determined by the nature of the CN - en and IWG - wg couplings . If either one of these couplings is stripeless ( i . e . takes the same value in all cells ) , then en and / or wg ( as targets ) will be unable to form their wild - type striped expression ( and characteristic asymmetry is thus made impossible ) . In our SPN , these couplings ( CN - en and IWG - wg ) are described mathematically by Hill functions . In our sixth chapter , “Stripes” , we show that the dose - response curve representations of these Hill functions can be used to determine whether the CN - en and / or IWG - wg cou - plings are stripeless ( for a given parameter set ) . In our seventh chapter , “Breakdown of SPN” , we make a probabilistic argument to support a previous proposal ( that our SPN can be thought of as two independent sub - systems when characteristic asymmetry is replicated ) . We consider a simpli - ﬁed two - dimensional ( 2 - D ) version of one of these sub - systems ( the one containing products of key SP gene wg - see Fig . 9 . 4 ) whose behaviour can be described in the form of a phase portrait . From the geometry of a phase portrait’s nullclines , we infer correlations between values of associated parameters and mode of wg - expression . Finally , we form a condition which can detect ubiquitous wg - expression in von Dassow’s SPN ( and hence , abnormal fruit ﬂy development ) using only the values of those ( ﬁve ) parameters associated to our 2 - D system . In our eighth chapter , “A new SPN” , we address the shortcomings of our SPN model ( in both its mathematical description and architecture ) . The structure of ODEs which govern mRNA levels in our SPN ( as well as in von Dassow’s ) is such that mRNA concentrations are more sensitive to levels of repression than to levels of induction . This has elements of the negative control observed in some prokary - otes , ( but not in the eukaryotic fruit ﬂy ) . We propose an altered structure for these ODEs ( one which removes the quasi - negative control ) . 204 Finally , we gave our attention to the architecture of our SPN . Parameter surveys failed to reveal a single parameter set which could replicate wild - type expression of all gene products in our SPN ( nor do von Dassow et al . report any such set ( s ) for their SPN model ) . We rewire some parts of our SPN and propose the inclusion of new nodes X and Z ( see Fig . 9 . 5 ) to ﬁll the gaps which emerge from our rewiring . Wild - type expression of a new node can be inferred from its role within the SPN - we propose candidates for X and Z ( there are various equally good candidates for X but products of the sloppy paired gene ( slp ) emerge as the best candidate for Z ) . Our new SPN model ( including an altered ODE structure , as discussed above ) is able to simultaneously replicate the wild - type expression of all its constituent gene products ( for an average of one in ten parameter sets ) . Figure 9 . 5 : Reduction of our new SPN model : X and Z ﬁll gaps in network . Though our methods have given rise to some speciﬁc conclusions , may our reader note the following examples of their generality . Structure of a Jacobian matrix may have an underlying simplicity which can be revealed if its entries are expressible in terms of variables’ steady state expressions . It may be possible to reduce the number of nodes and links in a regulatory network ( and hence the number of variables and parameters in the associated system ) if , for example , the translation process can be abridged ( i . e . if an mRNA and protein node can be merged into 205 a single node - we provide examples of when they can or cannot ) . And ﬁnally , whilst negative control may not have been appropriate to our model of study , we presented simple methods in our previous chapter for identifying an hierarchy amongst a ( negatively controlled ) system’s regulatory links . We propose that links uppermost in such a hierarchy are more likely to be the origin of any widespread failure in a ( negatively controlled ) system . 206 Chapter 10 Appendices 10 . 1 von Dassow’s ODE system for the segment polar - ity network ( SPN ) Some shorthand notation is used in the list of ordinary di ﬀ erential equations ( ODEs ) listed below .

This can be written in matrix form , i . e . IWG = M EWG i , j ( 10 . 1 ) where IWG and EWG are column vectors of length twenty four and M is a sym - metric 24 × 24 matrix of coe ﬃ cients . Left multiply both sides of ( 10 . 1 ) by the inverse of M ( which exists ) to obtain twenty four linear equations for EWG i , j as sums of IWG i functions . That is to say , all EWG i , j can be expressed in the following way , EWG i , j = ω 1 i , j IWG 1 + ω 2 i , j IWG 2 + ω 3 i , j IWG 3 + ω 4 i , j IWG 4 from which we conclude that if any EWG i , j share the same ω k i , j for all k = 1 . . . 4 , then it follows that those EWG i , j must be equal , for all parameter values . We ﬁnd , using Maple ( see another Appendix for the Maple program ) that there are such cases and that , in every cell , i . e . for i ∈ [ 1 , 4 ] , EWG i , 1 = EWG i , 4 EWG i , 2 = EWG i , 3 EWG i , 5 = EWG i , 6 . Thus we have an horizontal ﬂip symmetry . 10 . 3 Horizontal ﬂip symmetry of EWG nodes : Maple proof This is the Maple ﬁle used to establish that EWG nodes had a certain symmetry forced upon them by von Dassow’s ODEs themselves .

All ν parameter values were sampled uniformly on a linear scale over the range one to ten . Here is the plotting of parameters from all twenty one of the featured striped solutions in the “Our SPN” chapter . Let us begin with our ν parameters ( see Fig . 10 . 1 ) , noting that we include ν Bci only for computational convenience ( its value if ﬁxed at one for all parameters sets ) . In Figure 10 . 2 , we have the half - life parameters and , in Figure 10 . 3 , we have the rate parameters . 233 Figure 10 . 2 : From left to right , columns represent the parameters H en , H wg , H IWG , H EWG , H ptc , H ci , H CI and H CN respectively . All half - lives were sampled uniformly on a linear scale over the range ﬁve to one hundred . Figure 10 . 3 : From left to right , columns represent the parameters r EndoWG , r ExoWG , r MxferWG , r LMxferWG and C CI respectively . All rate parameters were sampled uni - formly on a log scale over the range 0 . 001 and one , so we use a logarithmic scale here for the vertical axis . . 234 10 . 10 Importance of ptc / PTC in striped solutions We believe the cleaving role played by ptc / PTC so important that its associated parameters are “less robust” to variation than others . For the twenty one striped solutions found in “Our SPN” , we found that ptc / PTC in our model ( before lifting ) as well as PTC in von Dassow’s model ( after lifting ) took one of four modes of expression . • expressed in the en / hh domain • expressed in the ci domain • expressed ubiquitously • expressed nowhere Is it this ﬂexibility in “the cleaving node” perhaps that holds the key to the system’s robustness ? The mode of expression of ptc / PTC ( before lifting ) matched that of PTC ( after lifting ) so what follows holds for both von Dassow’s SPN and our SPN . Note 10 . 10 . 1 Let us describe it in terms of ptc / PTC so that we do not have to talk about both ptc and PTC separately . Perhaps we should think of four main di ﬀ erent types of striped solution ( dependent on ptc / PTC expression ) where each type may have origins in quite di ﬀ erent regions of parameter - space . What are the implications of this ? Well , for example , conditions ( a parameter set ) may harbour wild - type expression of key SP genes for one type of ptc / PTC expression may not do so for another . Aside 10 . 10 . 1 To be more precise , what we mean is that two parameter sets which were exactly the same , but for those parameters which relate directly to ptc / PTC may produce very di ﬀ erent expressions of key SP genes . The importance of ptc / PTC is its role within the SPN , i . e . cleavage of CI into CN . If this task is not performed , CN will be deactivated and this would be disastrous for , as we have seen in the “Analysis of striped solutions” subsection of the “Our 235 SPN” chapter , CN ’s regulation of en is key to characteristic asymmetry . It follows that ptc / PTC should always cleave CI in the non - en domain ( cells one , two and four of the four - cell segment ) as CN must be active therein ( to turn en o ﬀ ) . But we have seen that ptc / PTC is sometimes OFF in the non - en domain ( when its expression is en - type or absent ) so how does it cleave ? Evidently , ptc / PTC does not have to be ON for cleavage to take place . Presumably , cleavage can be of su ﬃ cient potency to allow a smaller amount of ptc / PTC to perform the role of a much higher amount . Can we say anything about these two modes of ptc / PTC expression ? Whenever ptc / PTC was OFF in the non - en domain for our striped solutions in the “Our SPN” chapter , cleavage was never impotent , i . e . κ PTCCI (cid:60) O (cid:16) 10 − 1 (cid:17) . Aside 10 . 10 . 2 The striped solutions for which ptc / PTC was OFF in the non - en do - main were solutions 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 and 20 ( see tables in the “Striped solutions” section ) . Whenever ptc / PTC is en - type ( on exclusively in cell three ) , it puts restrictions on cleavage but , quite apart from this , surely it is a restriction in itself - ptc / PTC is initially turned on in all cells except cell three . Thus , ptc / PTC ’s initial mode of expression is complimentary to the en - type expression considered here . How can the expression of one gene product become so di ﬀ erent over times in a system ( the SPN ) which has otherwise remained static ( for striped solutions , initial modes of expression are preserved in all other SP gene products ) ? One might again assume that there is a limited pool of parameter sets for which this were possible . We propose that , for ptc / PTC to have en - type expression as part of a striped solution , CN - repression ( of ptc / PTC ) has squashed CI - induction in the non - en domain whilst the potency of CI - induction must be substantial ( to turn ptc / PTC on in cell three ) . And indeed , for striped solutions where ptc / PTC was turned on exclusively in cell three , we found that κ CIptc (cid:60) O (cid:16) 10 − 1 (cid:17) . Aside 10 . 10 . 3 The striped solutions for which ptc / PTC had en - type expression were solutions 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 and 15 ( see tables ) . 236 What about other types of expression ? What causes ptc / PTC to be turned on everywhere in striped solutions ? Presumably , CI - induction is signiﬁcantly potent and / or CN - repression is signiﬁcantly impotent . We found that both CN - repression was never potent and CI - induction was never impotent , i . e . κ CNptc (cid:60) O (cid:0) 10 − 3 (cid:1) and κ CIptc (cid:60) O (cid:16) 10 − 1 (cid:17) respectively . Aside 10 . 10 . 4 The striped solutions for which ptc / PTC was ubiquitously expressed were solutions 3 , 4 , 10 , 14 and 19 ( see tables ) . Let us summarise these ﬁndings . Summary 10 . 10 . 1 Each parameter set has a sort of tag , according to its ptc / PTC expres - sion . Some of these tags are more ideal than others in the context of the SPN’s natural function . Those which are less ideal are parts of more exclusive conditions ( from more restricted regions of parameter - space ) . Firstly , we ﬁnd that ptc / PTC ( as part of a striped solution ) cannot be turned o ﬀ in the non - en domain unless cleavage of cubitus interruptus protein is fairly potent . Natural expression of key SP gene en requires CN to have a striped pattern of expression , but when supplies of ptc / PTC are limited , that present must cleave CI potently if it is to succeed . Were there both a shortage of ptc and impotent cleavage , we would expect very low CN concentration throughout the SPN which would lead to misexpression of en . Secondly , the only possible cause en - type expression of ptc / PTC is the potence of its inducer , CI . Where both CI and CN are activated ( outside cell three ) repression squashes induction , but where both are deactivated ( exclusively in cell three ) repression of ptc / PTC must be weak , so we have , recalling that we use ptc ODEs for ptc / PTC , ptc 3 ≈ CI 3 κ ν C p CIptc + CI 3 which can be large if κ ν CIptc CIptc is small . Without this strong induction , ptc / PTC would be turned o ﬀ everywhere and that tag ( o ﬀ everywhere ) operates in di ﬀ erent , and perhaps distinctive , conditions ( a feature of which was described above ) . Thirdly , we found that ptc / PTC was not turned on everywhere when either CI - induction was impotent or CN - repression potent . Again , their importance is in the tag they give to conditions . If this tag 237 changes , it may trigger a change in levels of CI and CN concentration detrimental to their regulation of key SP genes ( en and wg ) e . g . wg 3 would receive both greater induction and less repression which may turn it on . 10 . 11 How to express steady state EWG in terms of wg only This requires some manipulation of the steady state expressions of both IWG and EWG ( taken from their associated ODEs - ( 10 . 21 ) and ( 10 . 22 ) respectively ) . We begin by rewriting ( 10 . 21 ) at steady state , i . e . IWG i = wg i + H IWG r EndoWG EWG i , T 1 + H IWG r ExoWG explicitly for all i , in vector form ,  IWG 1 IWG 2 IWG 3 IWG 4  = 1 1 + H IWG r ExoWG  wg 1 wg 2 wg 3 wg 4  + H IWG r EndoWG 1 + H IWG r ExoWG  EWG 1 , T EWG 2 , T EWG 3 , T EWG 4 , T  . ( 10 . 28 ) Next , we consider our ODE for EWG , ( 10 . 22 ) , at steady state , i . e . 0 = (cid:18) r ExoWG IWG i 3 + r MxferWG EWG n , j + 3 + r LMxferWG EWG i , lr (cid:19) − (cid:18) r EndoWG + r MxferWG + 2 r LMxferWG + 1 H EWG (cid:19) EWG i , j and rearrange by making IWG i the subject , IWG i = 3 r ExoWG (cid:18) r EndoWG + r MxferWG + 2 r LMxferWG + 1 H EWG (cid:19) EWG i , j − 3 r ExoWG (cid:16) r MxferWG EWG n , j + 3 + r LMxferWG EWG i , lr (cid:17) 238 which can be written explicitly for all i and j , in vector form ,   IWG 1 IWG 1 IWG 1 IWG 2 IWG 2 IWG 2 IWG 3 IWG 3 IWG 3 IWG 4 IWG 4 IWG 4     =     D − B 2 A − C 2 A − C 2 A 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 − C 2 A D 2 A − C 2 A 0 0 − B 2 A 0 0 0 0 0 0 − C 2 A − C 2 A D 2 A 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 − B 2 A 0 0 0 0 D − B 2 A − C 2 A − C 2 A 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 − C 2 A D 2 A − C 2 A 0 0 − B 2 A 0 0 0 0 − B 2 A 0 − C 2 A − C 2 A D 2 A 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 D − B 2 A − C 2 A − C 2 A 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 − C 2 A D 2 A − C 2 A 0 0 − B 2 A 0 0 0 0 − B 2 A 0 − C 2 A − C 2 A D 2 A 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 D − B 2 A − C 2 A − C 2 A 0 0 − B 2 A 0 0 0 0 0 0 − C 2 A D 2 A − C 2 A 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 − B 2 A 0 − C 2 A − C 2 A D 2 A       EWG 1 , 1 EWG 1 , 2 EWG 1 , 3 EWG 2 , 1 EWG 2 , 2 EWG 2 , 3 EWG 3 , 1 EWG 3 , 2 EWG 3 , 3 EWG 4 , 1 EWG 4 , 2 EWG 4 , 3     where A = r ExoWG 6 , B = r MxferWG , C = r LMxferWG and D = r EndoWG + r MxferWG + 2 r LMxferWG + 1 H EWG .

Simplifying ( 10 . 39 ) we obtain , kwg + kwg α WGwg  (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg κ ν WGwg WGwg + (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg  − α WGwg  (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg κ ν WGwg WGwg + (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg  = 0 ( 10 . 40 ) and we divide through by ( non - zero ) α WGwg to obtain , k α WGwg wg + kwg  (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg κ ν WGwg WGwg + (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg  −  (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg κ ν WGwg WGwg + (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg  = 0 ( 10 . 41 ) of which the second and third term can be combined to make a single term as follows , k α WGwg wg + (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg + 1 − (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg κ ν WGwg WGwg + (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg  = 0 ( 10 . 42 ) Subtract the second term from both sides of the equals sign and multiply through - out by the denominator of this term . This gives , k α WGwg wg (cid:16) κ ν WGwg WGwg + (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg (cid:17) = (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg − (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg + 1 ( 10 . 43 ) Expanding the LHS and rearranging , we obtain k α WGwg κ ν WGwg WGwg wg + 1 α WGwg (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg + 1 − (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg + (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg + 1 = 0 ( 10 . 44 ) before taking kwg out as a common factor , giving us , kwg (cid:34) 1 α WGwg κ ν WGwg WGwg + (cid:32) 1 + α WGwg α WGwg (cid:33) (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg − (cid:0) kwg (cid:1) ν WGwg − 1 (cid:35) = 0 . ( 10 . 45 ) Finally , we multiply throughout by the inverse of the coe ﬃ cient of wg ν WGwg to obtain , kwg (cid:34)(cid:32) 1 1 + α WGwg (cid:33) (cid:18) κ WGwg k (cid:19) ν WGwg + wg ν WGwg − 1 k (cid:32) α WGwg 1 + α WGwg (cid:33) wg ν WGwg − 1 (cid:35) = 0 . ( 10 . 46 ) Therefore the non - zero ﬁxed point values of wg in our 2 - D system are given by the solutions to , wg ν WGwg − α WGwg k (cid:16) 1 + α WGwg (cid:17) wg ν WGwg − 1 + (cid:32) 1 1 + α WGwg (cid:33) (cid:18) κ WGwg k (cid:19) ν WGwg = 0 . ( 10 . 47 ) 252 10 . 16 Probabilistic argument for sub - systems In our “Our SPN” chapter we proposed that , when our SPN captures its char - acteristic asymmetry ( simultaneous wild - type expression of both en and wg ) , it could be thought of as two independent sub - systems . And in our “Breakdown of SPN” chapter , we analysed one of the two sub - systems . Are we right to say that our SPN can be treated in this way ( as two independent systems ) ? If we are right , then the probability of ﬁnding characteristic asymmetry in our SPN ( which , in “Our SPN” we noted to be one in ﬁfty , on average - see Note 5 . 4 . 5 ) should be equal to the following product of probabilities , P ( natural wg in sub - system ) × P ( natural en in sub - system ) × P ( absent CI / CN - wg link ) How can we determine these probabilities ? Testing of the two sub - systems tells us that the probability of ﬁnding wild - type wg expression in our wg sub - system is around a third on average , whilst the probability of ﬁnding wild - type en expression in our en sub - system is somewhere between a quarter and a third on average . Aside 10 . 16 . 1 Testing the wg sub - system , we ran it three times , generating one hundred random parameter sets each time . We found hit - rates ( proportions of sets with wild - type wg ) as follows 32 100 , 37 100 , 32 100 which gave an aggregate average hit - rate of 33 . 67 % . Testing the en sub - system , again generating one hundred random parameter sets three times , ﬁrstly with low levels of induction ( from a dummy node D with levels of 0 . 001 in all cells ) we found hit - rates ( proportions of sets with wild - type en ) as follows 23 100 , 26 100 , 24 100 which gave an aggregate average hit - rate of 24 . 33 % . This was disappointingly low ( notice how much lower it is than the hit - rate of the wg sub - system . We tried again this time making levels of D slightly higher ( equal to 0 . 01 in all cells ) . This time , the hit - rates were 28 100 , 30 100 , 36 100 253 which gave an aggregate average of 31 . 33 % But what is the probability of ﬁnding an absent CI / CN - wg link in our SPN ? Well , our reader may recall that we inferred the necessity of its absence from the weakness of the CI - wg link , as represented by values of its associated parameters for striped solutions . In our “Our SPN” chapter , all twenty one parameter sets which we found to replicate characteristic asymmetry in our SPN featured values of , κ ν CIwg CIwg > 10 − 4 & κ CIwg > 10 − 2 . ( 10 . 48 ) Perhaps these conditions are su ﬃ cient to render the CI / CN - wg link in our SPN absent ? If so , ﬁnding the probability of their being met would be equivalent to ﬁnding the probability of an absent CI / CN - wg link . Thus we ask : what is the probability of these ( 10 . 48 ) conditions being met ? May our reader recall that κ CIwg takes values between 0 . 001 and one whilst ν CIwg takes values between one and ten . We can represent these conditions as a graph ( see Fig . 10 . 5 ) where the former of the two conditions in ( 10 . 48 ) is represented by the curve the former of which is represented by the curve , ν CIwg = − 4 log 10 κ CIwg ( 10 . 49 ) having taken logarithms on on either side , rearranged and formed an equality . Excluding parts below minimal ν CIwg ( it only takes values between one and ten ) and outside allowable κ WGwg ( see latter condition of ( 10 . 48 ) ) , the area beneath our curve signiﬁes possible “good” regions in parameter - space ( where striped solutions may be found ) . Denoting our logarithm term in ( 10 . 49 ) by x for convenience , let us integrate to ascertain the sum of two areas a and d , a + d = (cid:90) − 25 − 2 − 4 x . dx = [ − 4 lnx ] − 25 − 2 = 4 ln 2 − 4 ln 2 5 = 6 . 4377 ( 4 d . p . ) where we also know b , d and e to have areas 3 . 6 , 1 . 6 and 0 . 4 respectively . Therefore , our possible good region in parameter - space , equal to the combined areas of a 254 and b , is 8 . 4377 , to four decimal places . Hence , the probability of our conditions - see ( 10 . 48 ) - being met is , Area of good region Area of whole region = 8 . 4377 27 = 0 . 3125 ( 4 d . p . ) where denominators here refers to the area of the whole region in Figure 10 . 5 . Therefore , we have that , P ( natural wg in sub - system ) × P ( natural en in sub - system ) × P ( CI - wg link conditions met ) which is somewhere between 0 . 0260 and 0 . 0330 ( as the second probability is some - where between a quarter and a third - see Aside 10 . 16 . 1 ) . We would expect this value to be equal to , or slightly larger than , the probability of ﬁnding characteristic asymmetry in our SPN ( if indeed our SPN can be thought of as two indepen - dent sub - systems when it harbours its characteristic asymmetry ) , i . e . 0 . 02 ( one in ﬁfty ) . And indeed this is the case - we propose that the slight disparity between probabilities here is due to the di ﬀ erence between , P ( absent CI / CN - wg link ) and P ( CI - wg link conditions met ) which was to be expected , i . e . that conditions on the CI - wg link would not be su ﬃ cient to restrict the entire CI / CN - wg link . Figure 10 . 5 : Restrictions on the parameters associated to the CI - wg link in our SPN . 255 10 . 17 Ready source of striped solutions ? Our “Breakdown of SPN” chapter divided our SPN model into smaller sub - systems . Each of these sub - systems has “solutions” of its own ( the en sub - system has parameter sets which replicate wild - type en , whilst the wg sub - system has parameter sets which replicate wild - type wg ) . If we simultaneously lift pairs of such parameter sets ( associated to such sub - system solutions ) up to our SPN and restrict the CI / CN - wg link ( through parame - ters associated to that link - satisfying conditions found in the “Our SPN” chapter ) we believe that what results in our SPN should be a striped solution . If this were the case , we would have an almost endless supply of striped solutions ( once the CI / CN - wg link has been nulliﬁed , as was the case in our “Breakdown of SPN” chapter , the sub - systems both had high hit - rates ) . To elaborate , m and n solutions of the en and wg sub - systems respectively potentially make mn di ﬀ erent striped solutions ( in our SPN ) between them as we “glue them together” in all their possible combi - nations ( this is what we call lifting ) . Unfortunately , not all glued - together ( lifted ) parameter sets make a striped solution ( in our SPN ) . Each time , it was en which was misexpressed . As we observed in the birth of our “Breakdown of SPN” chapter , the en sub - system is more tricky as it takes a necessary input from the wg sub - system ( i . e . EWG which we tried to replicate with a dummy node ) . In a short test , we let m and n equal two and four respectively . That is , we experiment with two di ﬀ erent solutions from the en sub - system and four di ﬀ erent solutions from the wg sub - system . Six of the eight possible glued - together ( lifted ) parameter sets combined to make striped solutions in our SPN . We restricted the CI / CN - wg link , using κ CIwg = 1 , κ CNwg = 10 − 3 , ν CNwg = 10 & α CIwg = 1 and , given such an idealised κ CIwg , ν CIwg was su ﬃ ciently ﬂexible to be randomly chosen . 256 10 . 18 Our improved SPN model In our ﬁnal chapter , “A new SPN” , we suggested improvements to our previous SPN model . There is a simple reduction for this improved model ( done in the same way we reduced von Dassow’s SPN in our “Our SPN” chapter , i . e . by merging multiple nodes into single nodes ) and here we give the corresponding ODE system , which uses the same notations as our SPN model ( see previous Appendices ) .
