Clathrin and post - Golgi trafﬁcking : a very complicated issue David G . Robinson 1 and Peter Pimpl 2 1 Centre for Organismal Studies ( COS ) , University of Heidelberg , Heidelberg , Germany 2 Center for Plant Molecular Biology ( ZMBP ) , University of Tu¨bingen , Tu¨bingen , Germany Clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) are formed at the plasma membrane and act as vectors for endocytosis . They also assemble at the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) , but their exact function at this organelle is unclear . Recent studies have examined the effects on vacuolar and secretory protein transport of knockout mutations of the adaptor protein 1 ( AP1 ) m - adaptin subunit AP1 M , but these investigations do not clarify the situation . These muta - tions lead to the abrogation of multiple trafﬁcking path - ways at the TGN and cannot be used as evidence in favour of CCVs being agents for receptor - mediated ex - port of vacuolar proteins out of the TGN . This transport process could just as easily occur through the matura - tion of the TGN into intermediate compartments that subsequently fuse with the vacuole . Clathrin - coated vesicles In both plants and animals , there are three principal types of coated vesicles : clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) , coat protein I ( COPI ) - coated vesicles , and COPII - coated vesi - cles [ 1 ] . Plants form CCVs ( see Figure I in Box 1 ) at two locations ( Figure 1 ) — the plasma membrane ( PM ) and trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) — and they also seem to have the same ﬁve adaptor protein ( AP ) complexes as animals [ 2 – 4 ] . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is now a well - estab - lished process in plant cells [ 5 ] , and the role of the AP2 complex in this process has recently been documented [ 6 – 9 ] . By contrast , the role of the other AP complexes in plants is unclear . In the case of the AP1 complex it is controver - sial , especially with regard to its proposed role in the export of soluble vacuolar proteins out of the TGN ( com - pare [ 10 ] with [ 11 ] and [ 12 ] ) . Unfortunately , despite the publication of four AP1 - related papers within weeks of one another in the early summer of 2013 [ 13 – 16 ] , this situation has become even more complicated . In this opinion article we draw attention to the fact that a perturbation of vacuo - lar transport through the expression of m 1 mutants of the AP1 complex is insufﬁcient proof for the participation of CCVs in this process because secretion to the PM is equally affected . We also point out that there are other possible mechanisms for protein transport from the TGN to the vacuole that do not involve CCVs , and argue that CCVs formed at the TGN are more likely to be the vehicles that are responsible for recycling to the PM . Non - classical versus classical adaptors If CCVs are the exclusive agents for the export of soluble vacuolar proteins out of the TGN , then interfering with the assembly of the clathrin coat ( e . g . , by expressing mutants of adaptor proteins ) should severely inhibit vacuolar pro - tein transport . In one of the four recent studies , the apo - plastic ﬂuid from intact Arabidopsis leaves was analysed for the presence of the unprocessed forms of the vacuolar protease aleurain , which is normally transported into the vacuole and is processed there into a mature form [ 14 ] . Using this assay , an epsin - like protein termed MODIFIED TRANSPORT TO THE VACUOLE 1 ( MTV1 ) was identi - ﬁed [ 14 ] . Epsins are characterised by a conserved N - termi - nal phospholipid - binding domain : the epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain . In terms of CCV assembly , epsins can be classiﬁed as ‘non - classical’ monomeric adap - tors ( Box 1 ) . They were originally described in endocytic CCVs [ 17 ] but are now known to operate also in CCV formation at the TGN and endosomes in animals [ 18 ] and plants [ 19 ] . Because MTV1 locates to the TGN , the observed effects on vacuolar transport in an mtv1 mutant line have been interpreted as supporting the notion that CCVs are responsible for the export of soluble vacuolar cargo out of the TGN [ 14 ] . However , the effects caused by the mtv1 mutation were slight and only detectable after overexposing the immunoblots . So too were the differences in size and morphology of protein storage vacuoles in Col - 0 wild type and mtv1 Arabidopsis embryos . Such minor effects are not what one would expect if a key player in CCV assembly was no longer available , and not if CCVs were strictly required for cargo exit at the TGN . A possible explanation for the weak phenotype shown by the mtv1 mutants can be deduced from a study on the Arabidopsis m - adaptin subunits AP1M1 and AP1M2 [ 13 ] . These two subunits are closely related and functionally redundant , and they are central to the function of the AP1 adaptor complex : the ‘classical’ heterotetrameric adap - tor that locates to the TGN in all eukaryotes [ 20 ] . Although an ap1m1 ap1m2 double mutant is pollen lethal , transport of soluble vacuolar proteins was impaired in the single - knockout mutant ap1m2 . As in [ 14 ] and [ 19 ] , the failure to process a soluble vacuolar cargo protein [ ARABIDOPSIS Opinion 1360 - 1385 / $ – see front matter (cid:2) 2013 Elsevier Ltd .

Clathrin - coated vesicles Clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) are one of four types of coated membrane carriers [ coat protein I ( COPI ) - coated vesicles , coat protein II ( COPII ) – coated vesicles , retromer - coated vesicles , and CCVs ] that are responsible for intracellular protein transport events in eukaryotic cells [ 65 – 67 ] . CCVs are formed at the plasma membrane ( PM ) and at the surface of the trans - Golgi network and endosomes , where they are responsible for endocytosis and various post - Golgi trafficking pro - cesses , respectively [ 68 – 70 ] . The outermost shell of the CCV is a cage of interlocking clathrin triskelions , which are formed from three heavy and three light chains [ 71 ] . Recruitment of clathrin onto membranes occurs via adaptor protein ( AP ) complexes . One class of AP complex is heterotetrameric ( see Figure I ) , consisting of two large subunits ( called adaptins ) of around 100 kDa ( b 1 – 5 and one each of a / g / d / e / z ) , a medium subunit ( m 1 – 5 ) of around 50 kDa , and a small subunit ( s 1 – 4 ) of about 20 kDa [ 4 , 20 ] . The m - adaptin is crucial to CCV assembly in that it recognizes both tyrosine - based ( YXX F ) and dileucine - based [ ( DE ) xxxL ( LI ) ] motifs in the cytosolic domains of transmembrane receptors , thereby conferring a selective function to CCV in terms of cargo transport [ 72 ] . In mammalian and yeast cells there are five adaptor complexes : AP2 localizes exclusively to the PM , AP1 is present on the trans - Golgi network , and AP3 to AP5 are found on endosomal compartments [ 4 ] . In addition to the ‘classical’ tetrameric adaptor complexes , there are a number of ‘non - classical’ adaptors , such as the Golgi - localizing gamma adaptin ear homology - containing ARF - binding ( GGA ) proteins , AP - 180 , and the E / ANTH proteins . These are mono - meric and bind — like their tetrameric counterparts — to phosphoinosi - tides in addition to their specific cargo receptors [ 73 ] . The Arabidopsis genome encodes most of the clathrin machinery proteins [ 74 ] . There are two genes for clathrin heavy chains and three genes for light chains . Genes for the subunits of four tetrameric adaptor complexes ( AP1 to AP4 ) have also been identified . There are five genes for the medium subunits [ 3 ] but only four for the small subunits [ 4 ] . In addition , a cell plate - specific adaptin called TPLATE has been identified in plants [ 75 ] . A clear allocation of the individual AP complexes to specific membranes in plants has not yet been achieved [ 13 ] .

We suggest that the difference in the degree of perturbation might be explained by a redundan - cy in terms of adaptors . Whereas the classical AP1 adap - tors are essential for CCV assembly , the non - classical MTV1 / EPSIN1 - type adaptors probably only act as helper proteins . Should the non - classical adaptors fail , CCV for - mation would still occur , albeit at a suboptimal rate . Conversely , if the classical adaptors were knocked out , CCV formation could not be maintained with non - classical adaptors alone , and as a result vacuolar protein transport would be more seriously affected . This would be similar to the situation in mammalian cells with the Golgi - localizing gamma adaptin ear homology - containing ARF - binding ( GGA ) proteins and the AP1 adaptors cooperating in mannosyl 6 - phosphate receptor ( MPR ) – ligand sequestra - tion at the TGN [ 21 ] . Do AP1 adaptors participate in more than one trafﬁcking pathway ? It is generally considered that an adaptor complex is speciﬁc for only one trafﬁcking pathway in a particular cell , so the observation that the secretion of invertase , a non - vacuolar reporter protein , was equally affected in the ap1m2 protoplasts was unexpected [ 13 ] . In addition , in - stead of being retained at the TGN , both AALP – green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) and invertase – GFP accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . Interestingly , the same phenotype was observed in leaf protoplasts prepared from vacuole sorting receptor 1 ( vsr1 ) vsr3 double mutants [ 22 ] . If , as commonly believed , VSRs bind their ligands at the TGN and direct them into CCVs , then vacuolar cargo should have accumulated in the TGN or in the Golgi stack in these VSR mutants . The expression of mutants of the sorting nexins ( also located to the TGN ) also inhibits vacuolar protein transport and leads to an accumulation of vacuolar cargo in the ER [ 23 ] . There is clearly some kind PM ER Golgi stack TGN TGN / RE ?

Pathways for protein transport to the vacuole . Most vacuolar proteins ( soluble and membrane protein cargo ) leave the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) in a coat protein II ( COPII ) - vesicle - dependent manner ( step 1 ) . Owing to high Ca 2 + concentrations in the ER lumen , soluble cargo proteins bind to vacuolar sorting receptors ( VSRs ) . Secretory and vacuolar cargo traverse the Golgi stack as a consequence of cisternal maturation ( step 2 ) . The last stage in this membrane flow process is the release of the trans - most cisternae , which becomes the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) . As the TGN matures , several vesiculation processes begin to occur . First , secretory cargo is sequestered into secretory vesicles , which move to the plasma membrane ( PM ) ( step 3 ) . Second , after dissociation of their cargo ligands , VSRs accumulate in retromer - coated carriers for recycling to upstream targets in the early secretory pathway ( step 4 ) . Further maturation of the TGN includes the formation of two types of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) — adaptor protein 1 ( AP1 ) - and AP3 - containing CCVs — and in the development of a pre - multivesicular body ( MVB ) ( step 5 ) . Fragmentation of the TGN ( step 6 ) separates the MVB from CCV - forming domains , which release AP1 - CCVs for transport ( recycling ) of membrane proteins to the PM ( step 7 ) and AP3 - CCVs for the transport of membrane proteins to the vacuole ( step 8 ) . Fusion of the MVB with the tonoplast delivers soluble proteins and some membrane proteins to the vacuole . There is also a direct transport route to the tonoplast from the ER for some other membrane proteins ( step 9 ) , which occurs during vacuole biogenesis in post - meristematic cells . The TGN also acts as the early endosome , and receives incoming AP2 - CCV from the PM . Examples of tonoplast proteins being delivered via the three different transport routes ( steps 6 , 9 , and 10 ) are given in the section ‘Multiple transport routes for tonoplast proteins’ in the main text . Opinion Trends in Plant Science March 2014 , Vol . 19 , No . 3 136 of feedback between correct TGN function and ER export but , as succinctly stated in [ 13 ] , ‘it is poorly understood how a defect in post - Golgi trafﬁcking might affect the ER exit of post - Golgi cargos’ . Trafﬁcking of the syntaxin KNOLLE to the developing cell plate was also severely affected in the ap1m2 plants [ 13 , 15 ] . It would thus seem that trafﬁcking from the TGN to the PM is just as dependent on this m - adaptin , and thus on AP1 , as was suggested for the trafﬁc to the vacuole . This fact is underlined in the most recent of the four papers to be published on this theme [ 16 ] . In this study the authors analysed the recycling of two PM proteins in Arabidopsis hap13 - 1 plants , which have the same mutant allele as ap1m2 ( the u1 adaptin AP1M2 was previously called HAPLESS13 ) . The typical asymmetric PM distribution of the PIN - formed auxin efﬂux carrier PIN2 was compro - mised , and the recycling of PIN2 from brefeldin A ( BFA ) bodies to the PM , which normally occurs after this drug is washed out [ 24 ] , was inhibited . The same effect was ob - served in the case of the receptor - like kinase BRI1 ( BRAS - SINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 ) , which also remained in the BFA bodies during a BFA wash out . An analysis of endocytic uptake of the styryl dye FM4 - 64 revealed that although this dye did reach the tonoplast in the hap13 - 1 mutant , it too remained trapped in the BFA body during BFA washout [ 16 ] . Because it is assumed that CCVs are the vehicles through which PIN2 is recycled to the PM [ 25 ] , these data imply that they too contain the AP1 adaptor . Together , these data show that claims for the participa - tion of CCVs in vacuolar protein transport on the basis of an inhibition of AP1 ( or any other ) adaptor function are equivocal because other trafﬁcking pathways seem to be equally affected . Furthermore , the inhibition of invertase secretion in the ap1m2 mutant , as reported in [ 13 ] , is not proof of CCVs acting as secretory vesicles . Electron micro - scope tomography of the plant TGN clearly shows that these two transport vesicles differ in size and morphology [ 60 ] . From these data , one can conclude that interfering with AP1 function has serious long - term repercussions for all TGN transport processes . How many types of CCV are formed at the plant TGN ? AP1 - containing CCVs are formed at the TGN in mammals , and a different set of CCVs ( possibly containing AP4 ) is formed at the early endosome ( EE ) [ 26 ] . However , because the plant TGN also functions as an EE [ 27 , 28 ] , how many types of CCV are formed on this hybrid organelle ? Of the ﬁve adaptor protein complexes that have now been identiﬁed , only one ( AP1 ) has so far been localized to the plant TGN [ 15 ] . It has been speculated that the AP3 adaptor complex might also locate to the plant TGN [ 29 ] , but direct proof is still lacking . In yeast and mammals , AP3 does not seem to bind clathrin [ 30 ] , but in plants it apparently does [ 29 , 31 ] . Therefore , we might predict that there are at least two types of CCV at the plant TGN — AP1 - and AP3 - containing CCVs — but what precisely could their functions be ? There is evidence to suggest that the AP3 adaptor complex is involved in the trafﬁcking of membrane trans - port proteins to the vacuole [ 32 , 33 ] . As in the yeast Sac - charomyces cerevisiae , this transport pathway might bypass the multivesicular late endosome or prevacuolar compartment ( PVC ) [ 34 ] . But what is the true function of the AP1 adaptor complex ? The data presented in [ 13 ] and [ 16 ] suggest that AP1 is involved both in the export of soluble vacuolar cargo out of the TGN and in recycling membrane proteins from the TGN to the PM . It would be contrary to the selective targeting properties of the adap - tors if AP1 were to be a crucial player in both pathways , so which of the two possibilities is the more likely ? Because an alternative mechanism for the transport of soluble vacuo - lar cargo proteins that does not require CCV has been put forward [ 35 , 36 ] , we would argue in favour of AP1 - contain - ing CCVs performing a recycling function at the TGN . Evidence in favour of CCVs mediating vacuolar protein transport The notion that VSRs cycle between the TGN and multi - vesicular bodies ( MVBs ) using CCVs for the anterograde leg of the journey ( with cargo ligands ) and retromer - coated carriers for the retrograde trip ( without ligands ) is heavily inﬂuenced by comparison to MPR - mediated transport of lysosomal hydrolases in mammalian cells [ 21 ] . A number of papers supporting this concept can be found in the plant literature , e . g . , [ 22 , 37 – 39 ] ( for a detailed discussion of the above - mentioned publications , see [ 12 ] ) . However , the va - lidity of this analogy can be questioned on the basis of the following points : ( i ) in terms of sorting motifs and receptor structure , VSRs and MPRs are in no way comparable [ 11 ] ; ( ii ) unlike the situation in mammalian cells , in which MPR – ligand interactions cannot occur earlier than the TGN ( see [ 11 ] for a discussion ) , there is good evidence that VSR – ligand binding in plants occurs in the ER [ 23 , 40 , 41 ] ; and ( iii ) with the discovery of VSRs at the PM [ 39 , 42 ] , one must ask whether BP80 ( binding protein 80 kDa , the original VSR ) , which was isolated from a subcellular frac - tion enriched in CCV from developing pea cotyledons [ 43 , 44 ] , might have been present in endocytic rather than TGN - derived CCVs . It is also possible that the presence of BP80 in the pea cotyledon CCV fraction was the result of contamination of the fraction with so - called ‘dense vesi - cles’ , because such fractions are not homogeneous . Dense vesicles are the vectors for storage protein transport out of the Golgi apparatus in legumes [ 45 ] , and they carry VSRs [ 46 ] . One should also note that there at least two cases in the plant literature where contaminating membranes in CCV fractions have led to false claims about the properties of CCVs [ 47 , 48 ] . Thus , the biochemical isolation of VSRs from a vesicle fraction that contains two populations of CCVs ( endocytic and TGN - derived ) and is contaminated with other transport vesicles cannot serve as unequivocal evidence that TGN - derived CCVs carry VSRs . Retromer and VSR recycling Data pertaining to the location of retromer and the sorting nexins are contradictory , making the retromer - mediated retrieval of VSRs from a post - TGN compartment a very controversial issue [ 11 , 12 ] . Immunogold electron micros - copy has at least settled the issue that the sorting nexins localize to the TGN [ 49 ] . However , the situation regarding the retromer core has become even more confusing with the recent report that its recruitment requires RABG3F [ 50 ] . This effector localizes to the tonoplast and / or an immediate Opinion Trends in Plant Science March 2014 , Vol . 19 , No . 3 137 prevacuolar fusion compartment [ 51 ] . Such a compart - ment , termed a ‘late prevacuolar compartment’ ( LPVC ) , has been identiﬁed . However , it is characterized by the relative lack of VSRs [ 52 , 53 ] . So , if the retromer core is indeed recruited to the LPVC , what cargo does it recycle ? TGN maturation as a mechanism for the transport of soluble cargo to the vacuole After lysosomal hydrolases reach the lumen of the EE , their further transport via the late endosome ( LE ) to the lysosome is considered to occur through the gradual trans - formation of the EE into the LE [ 21 , 54 ] . This process no longer requires MPRs that have become dissociated from their ligands in the EE . Thus , anterograde , post - EE trans - port in mammals does not require the formation of vesicles , although retromer - coated carriers containing MPRs are released during the maturation process [ 21 ] . In plants , the TGN and EE are not separate organelles [ 27 , 55 ] ; therefore , one might ask whether anterograde trans - port of vacuolar cargo out of this hybrid TGN / EE compart - ment is also accomplished by maturation . A number of observations support this possibility . TGN to vacuole trans - port can be interrupted by application of the vacuolar H ( + ) - ATPase ( VHA - ATPase ) inhibitor concanamycin A , which prevents TGN formation and release from the Golgi stack , leading to a drastic reduction in the number of MVBs , which represent the LE in plant cells [ 36 ] . During washing out of concanamycin A , it has been possible to observe TGN regen - eration and the formation of pre - MVB - like structures from the TGN [ 36 ] . TGN formation is a consequence of cisternal maturation in the Golgi stack , a process that has been conﬁrmed by experiments with BFA [ 56 , 57 ] . TGN release from the stack is also well known from electron microscope observations ( e . g . , [ 58 ] ) and has been conﬁrmed recently with live cell imaging [ 59 ] . Electron microscope tomography has also shown that after release , some of the TGN fragments seem to mature into MVBs [ 60 ] . That MVBs develop out of the TGN is also supported by the localisation of the ESCRT ( Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport ) com - plexes I to III , which are detected in a step - wise gradient from trans - Golgi cisternae through the TGN to the MVB [ 36 ] . If the MVB develops out of the TGN via maturation , what is the purpose of a seemingly redundant vesicle - mediated anterograde transport from the TGN to the MVB ? Multiple transport routes for tonoplast proteins If AP1 - adaptor - type CCVs are responsible for the export of VSR vacuolar cargo ligands out of the TGN , are they also the agents of choice for other transmembrane proteins destined for the tonoplast ? At the moment a deﬁnitive answer to this question cannot be given , but recently published data point to the existence of multiple transport routes for tonoplast proteins [ 33 , 61 , 62 ] . Although it is possible that the aquaporin a - TIP ( Tonoplast Integral Protein ) might follow the same route as soluble cargo [ 61 ] , there is contradictory evidence indicating that this protein does not enter the Golgi [ 63 ] . Some tonoplast proteins seem to require AP3 - type CCVs for their trans - port , exempliﬁed by the sucrose transporter SUC4 [ 33 ] . By contrast , INOSITOL TRANSPORTER 1 ( INT1 ) follows an AP3 - independent route [ 33 ] . Because BFA inhibits the trafﬁcking of both of these transporters , they presumably leave the ER in a COPII - dependent manner and travel through the Golgi apparatus . This is not the case for the vacuolar ATPase isoform VHA - a3 , which successfully traf - ﬁcs to the tonoplast in an AP3 mutant and also when ER - to - Golgi transport is blocked [ 62 ] . Another example of a tonoplast protein that exits the ER in a COPII - indepen - dent manner and also bypasses the Golgi is CALCI - NEURIN B - LIKE PROTEIN 6 ( CBL6 ) [ 64 ] . These different possibilities for the transport of soluble and membrane cargos to the vacuole are depicted in Figure 1 . Acknowledgements We thank Karin Schumacher for useful discussions .
