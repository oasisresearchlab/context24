In animals and yeast , the best characterized pathway for endocytosis depends on the function of the vesicle coat protein clathrin . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis has recently been demonstrated also in plant cells , but its physiological and developmental roles remain unclear . Here , we assessed the roles of the clathrin - mediated mechanism of endocytosis in plants by genetic means . We interfered with clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) function through mutants and dominant - negative approaches in Arabidopsis thaliana and established tools to manipulate clathrin function in a cell type – speciﬁc manner . The chc2 single mutants and dominant - negative CHC1 ( HUB ) transgenic lines were defective in bulk endocytosis as well as in internalization of prominent plasma membrane proteins . Interference with clathrin - mediated endocytosis led to defects in constitutive endocytic recycling of PIN auxin transporters and their polar distribution in embryos and roots . Consistent with this , these lines had altered auxin distribution patterns and associated auxin transport - related phenotypes , such as aberrant embryo patterning , imperfect cotyledon speciﬁcation , agravitropic growth , and impaired lateral root organogenesis . Together , these data demonstrate a fundamental role for clathrin function in cell polarity , growth , patterning , and organogenesis in plants . INTRODUCTION Endocytosis is the process by which fragments of the plasma membrane are pinched off to form membrane vesicles in the cytosol . Through this mechanism , the endocytic vesicles can incorporate cargo from the plasma membrane and extracellular space and reroute it to various subcellular compartments , in - cluding retargeting to the plasma membrane . In animals and yeast , endocytosis is an important mechanism to regulate pro - tein abundance at the plasma membrane during signaling events and retargeting or degradation of membrane proteins ( Mukherjee et al . , 1997 ) . In plants , the existence , physical feasibility , and physiological signiﬁcance of endocytosis have been a matter of debate for decades , speciﬁcally due to the presence of a cell wall and high cellular turgor pressure ( Cram , 1980 ; Robinson et al . , 2008 ) . Yet , in plants , endocytosis can be observed in many processes important for plant development , such as auxin transport ( Geldner et al . , 2001 ; Paciorek et al . , 2005 ; Dhonukshe et al . , 2008a ) , cytokinesis ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2006 ; Boutte´ et al . , 2010 ) , cell wall formation ( Balusˇka et al . , 2002 ) , root hair mor - phogenesis ( Takeda et al . , 2008 ) , pollen tube growth ( Sousa et al . , 2008 ; Zhao et al . , 2010 ) , self - incompatiblity responses ( Ivanov and Gaude , 2009 ) , responses to pathogens ( Robatzek et al . , 2006 ) , abscisic acid responses ( Sutter et al . , 2007 ) , bras - sinosteroid signaling ( Russinova et al . , 2004 ; Geldner et al . , 2007 ) , and responses to high boron levels ( Takano et al . , 2005 , 2010 ) . During responses to pathogens , abscisic acid , and high boron levels , the abundance of speciﬁc proteins in the plasma mem - brane is downregulated through induction of their endocytosis ( Takano et al . , 2005 , 2010 ; Robatzek et al . , 2006 ; Sutter et al . , 2007 ) , whereas other signals , such as auxin , actively repress endocytosis ( Paciorek et al . , 2005 ; Robert et al . , 2010 ) . The sig - niﬁcance of endocytosis for these regulations is beyond doubt ; however , functional data remain scarce . In animals and yeast , the selective budding of cargo proteins from cellular membranes involves predominantly the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) . Fundamentally , CCV forma - tion requires the assembly of a polyhedral cage composed of clathrin heteropolymers of heavy and light chains ( Fotin et al . , 2004 ) . Such CCVs were found at the plasma membrane , trans - Golgi network , endosomes , and lysosomes , where they effect endocytosis , protein sorting , and degradation ( Kirchhausen , 1 These authors contributed equally to this work . 2 Current address : Department of Biological Science , Graduate School of Science , Osaka University , Machikaneyama - cho 1 - 1 , Toyonaka , Osaka 560 - 0043 , Japan . 3 Current address : Department of Forest Genetics and Plant Physiology , Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences / Umea˚ Plant Science Centre , 901 83 Umea ˚ , Sweden . 4 Address correspondence to jiri . friml @ psb . vib - ugent . be .

The signiﬁcance of clathrin is also apparent in other processes , such as establishment of polarity ( Deborde et al . , 2008 ) , cytokinesis ( Schweitzer et al . , 2005 ) , virus infection ( Marsh and Helenius , 2006 ) , and so on . The genomes of ﬂowering plants contain several essential genes coding for clathrin - related machinery , including clathrin light and heavy chains ( Holstein , 2002 ) . Moreover , clathrin can be found at the trans - Golgi network – related structures and plasma membrane in higher plants ( Blackbourn and Jackson , 1996 ; Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ; Fujimoto et al . , 2010 ; Van Damme et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , it seems that clathrin could also mediate protein sorting , degradation , and endocytosis in plants ( Robinson et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , pharmacological inhibitors of clathrin - mediated endocytosis in yeast and animals are also potent inhibitors of plant endocytosis ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ; Boutte´ et al . , 2010 ) . As they also interfere with the interaction between cargo proteins and clathrin - recruiting adaptor protein complexes in plants , these drugs have been suggested to impede clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Ortiz - Zapater et al . , 2006 ) . The requirement of clathrin function for endocytosis was further demonstrated via dominant - negative approaches in plant cell suspensions ( Tahara et al . , 2007 ) , protoplasts ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ) , and plants ( Robert et al . , 2010 ) . However , the physiological and develop - mental importance of clathrin - mediated endocytosis awaits detailed characterization . Here , we present a genetic character - ization of the in planta role of clathrin in endocytosis and auxin - mediated plant development . Figure 1 . Requirement of Clathrin Function for Endocytosis .

Clathrin in Plant Cell Polarity 1921 RESULTS Dominant - Negative Clathrin HUB Interferes with Bulk Endocytosis in Planta The formation of a functional clathrin polyhedral involves the formation of complexes between clathrin heavy and light chains . Clathrin heavy chains interact with light chains through residues in their C terminus ( Brodsky et al . , 2001 ) . Previously , over - expression of a C - terminal portion of clathrin heavy chain1 ( HUB ) had been shown in mammalian cells to act as a dominant - negative form of clathrin through competition for clathrin light chain binding ( Liu et al . , 1995 , 1998 ) . Also in plant systems , expression of a truncated plant clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) was able to inhibit endocytosis ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ; Tahara et al . , 2007 ; Robert et al . , 2010 ) . We used transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines harboring a 4 - hydroxytamoxifen - inducible RFP - HUB1 ( INTAM > > RFP - HUB1 ) to investigate further the effects of HUB expression on endocytosis in plants . To monitor general endocytosis , we analyzed the intracellular accumulation of the endocytic tracer N - ( 3 - triethylammonium - propyl ) - 4 - ( 4 - diethylaminophenylhexatrienyl ) pyridinium dibro - mide ( FM4 - 64 ) ( Jelı´nkova´ et al . , 2010 ) . Twenty - four hours or 1 d of induction ( DOI ) of HUB expression signiﬁcantly ( P < 0 . 0001 ; Student’s t test ) reduced intracellular labeling with FM4 - 64 in INTAM > > RFP - HUB1 compared with the driver control ( Figures 1A and 1B ; see Supplemental Figure 1A online ) . After 48 h or 2 DOI , the inhibitory effect of HUB expression on endocytosis was further enhanced ( P < 0 . 0001 ; Student’s t test ) ( Figures 1C and 1D ; see Supplemental Figure 1B online ) . These data show that genetic interference with CHC function inhibited general endo - cytotic events in planta . To corroborate this observation , we investigated the effects on the intracellular accumulation of several transmembrane proteins . To visualize their endocytosis , we inhibited exocytosis using the fungal toxin , brefeldin A ( BFA ) . This toxin not only inhibits trafﬁcking from the endosomes to the plasma mem - brane , it also induces aggregation of endosomes into so - called BFA compartments ( Geldner et al . , 2001 ; Balusˇka et al . , 2002 ; Grebe et al . , 2003 ) . In the driver line , BFA treatment caused an intracellular accumulation of the auxin transport proteins PIN - FORMED1 ( PIN1 ) , PIN2 , plasma membrane H + - ATPase ( PM ATPase ) , and the endosomal marker ADP ribosylation factor 1 ( ARF1 ) in BFA compartments ( Figures 1E , 1G , and 1I ) , consis - tent with previous observations ( Geldner et al . , 2001 ; Tanaka et al . , 2009 ) . By contrast , PIN1 , PIN2 , and PM ATPase no longer accumulated in BFA compartments after HUB induction ( Figures 1F and 1H ) , whereas ARF1 did ( Figures 1I and 1J ) , implying that HUB expression impaired internalization of proteins from the plasma membrane without affecting BFA compartment forma - tion . To exclude potential artifacts inherent to pharmacological treatments , we transactivated HUB expression in cortical and endodermal cells using a cell type – speciﬁc GAL4 - expressing enhancer trap line ( J0571 > > RFP - HUB1 ) ( Figure 1K ; see Supple - mental Figure 2 online ) . Following BFA treatment , PIN1 and PIN2 proteins accumulated in the BFA bodies in the stele and epi - dermis , whereas no BFA bodies were visible in the cortex and Figure 2 .

These results demonstrate that expression of a dominant - negative clathrin HUB interferes with the endocytosis of integral plasma membrane proteins in plants . It also provides a tool to manipulate endocytosis in speciﬁc cells and cell types . It should be noted that these experiments do not allow the exclusion of a role for clathrin in protein sorting and degradation . Dominant - Negative Clathrin HUB Interferes with Different Aspects of Plant Development Next , we assessed the effects of impaired clathrin function caused by clathrin HUB induction on postembryonic plant de - velopment . Seedlings germinated under inductive conditions were strongly defective in seedling growth , with highly impaired root elongation , agravitropic root growth , and yellow / white , nonexpanded cotyledons ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . Etiolated seed - lings had agravitropic hypocotyls and open cotyledons ( Figures 2C and 2D ) . Moreover , after transfer from noninductive medium to medium supplemented with 4 - hydroxytamoxifen , roots became agravi - tropic within 2 DOI ( Figures 2E and 2F ) . Some of the observed phenotypic defects were difﬁcult to attribute to a speciﬁc sig - naling process . However , the observed agravitropic growth was indicative of defects in auxin transport . Therefore , we tested spe - ciﬁcally whether other auxin transport – dependent processes , such as lateral root formation ( Benkova´ et al . , 2003 ; Geldner et al . , 2004 ) , were affected by interference with clathrin function . Seedlings were germinated on noninductive medium and trans - ferred to auxin - containing inductive medium . Within 2 DOI , discrete lateral root primordia formed along the main root of control seedlings ( Figure 2G ) . By contrast , HUB - expressing seedlings displayed a highly disorganized proliferation of peri - cycle cells , reminiscent of the effects of impaired polar auxin transport ( Figure 2H ) ( Benkova´ et al . , 2003 ; Geldner et al . , 2004 ) . Together , these data show that clathrin function is required for auxin - dependent plant development and other processes . Dominant - Negative Clathrin HUB Interferes with Auxin Distribution Because gravitropic growth and lateral root morphogenesis notoriously depend on dynamic auxin redistribution ( Luschnig et al . , 1998 ; Swarup et al . , 2001 ; Benkova´ et al . , 2003 ; Geldner et al . , 2004 ; Abas et al . , 2006 ) , we investigated the effect of clathrin HUB induction on auxin distribution with the auxin Figure 3 .

Error bars are SD . Clathrin in Plant Cell Polarity 1923 reporter DR5rev : green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ; Friml et al . , 2003 ) . In wild - type meristems , DR5rev : GFP was highly active in columella and in stele tissues ( Figure 3A ) . After gravistimulation , the DR5rev : GFP signal relocated asymmetrically to the gravi - stimulated side , indicating a shift in auxin distribution ( Figure 3C ) ( Luschnig et al . , 1998 ; Ottenschla¨ger et al . , 2003 ) . By contrast , induction of clathrin HUB caused ectopic lateral DR5rev : GFP expression on both sides of the meristem , independently of gravistimulation ( Figures 3B and 3D ) . In auxin - induced lateral roots , the DR5rev : GFP activity showed a maximum in the tip of developing lateral roots ( Figure 3E ) ( Benkova´ et al . , 2003 ; Geldner et al . , 2004 ) . However , this max - imum could not be observed after RFP - HUB1 induction but was rather a signal continuum ( Figure 3F ) . These data suggest that interference with clathrin function through HUB expression affects plant growth responses through its effects on auxin distribution . Therefore , we tested the effect of HUB expression on auxin transport . To exclude potential artifacts due to changed root growth and morphology after long - term HUB induction , we used 1 DOI seedlings for auxin transport measurements , in which root morphology and PIN2 polarity was not visibly affected ( see Supplemental Figure 3 online ) . We found that acropetal auxin transportwasincreased by ; 25 % after 1DOIcomparedwiththe mock treatment ( P < 0 . 05 ; Student’s t test ) ( Figure 3G ) . Given the prominent role of PIN proteins and their constitutive endocytic dynamics in auxin transport , it is likely that these effects are a consequence of altered PIN trafﬁcking dynamics . CHC Mutants Have Defects in Endocytosis As we demonstrated that interference with clathrin function through induction of HUB strongly impairs endocytosis , we wondered whether endocytosis might also be affected in loss - of - function mutants defective in clathrin . The Arabidopsis genome encodes three clathrin light chains ( CLCs ) and two CHCs . In each of the CHC genes , we identiﬁed homozygous T - DNA insertion lines , for which no full - length transcripts could be detected , indicating they represent knock - out mutants ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . The high degree of sequence identity ( > 90 % ) between the two CHC gene products hints at functional redundancy between both CHC genes . Therefore , wetried toobtaindouble mutants . Assum - ing an average recombination frequency of 250 kb / centimorgan in Arabidopsis ( Lukowitz et al . , 2000 ) , a recombination frequency of ; 4 % might be expected between both CHC genes ( < 900 kb apart ) . However , wefound nodouble mutants nor plantsthat were homozygous for one mutation and heterozygous for the other in a large population of F2 plants ( Table 1 ) , suggesting that CHC1 and CHC2 genes are redundantly essential for the viability of game - tophytes and / or zygotes . Nonetheless , we cannot rule out a lower recombination frequency between both genes . Previously , it was shown that CHC localizes at the plasma membrane and to trans - Golgi – related structures of root cells ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ) . We analyzed CHC subcellular localiza - tions in the wild type and the respective chc mutants but could not Figure 4 . Characterization of chc Mutant Alleles .

Intracellular accumulation of FM4 - 64 is apparent within 6 min after incubation in 2 m M FM4 - 64 in the wild type ( C ) and chc1 - 2 mutants ( D ) . By contrast , the intracellular signal is much weaker in chc2 alleles ( [ E ] and [ F ] ) . ( G ) Quantiﬁcation of relative FM4 - 64 uptake . Error bars indicate SD . Asterisks indicate P < 0 . 0001 ( Student’s t test ) ; n = number of cells analyzed . 1924 The Plant Cell ﬁnd obvious differences , suggesting that CHC1 and CHC2 share subcellular localizations ( see Supplemental Figure 4 online ) . Fol - lowing the intracellular accumulation of the endocytic tracer dye FM4 - 64 , wecouldﬁndclearlabelingofendosomesinthewildtype and chc1 - 2 within 6 min ( Figures 4C , 4D , and 4G ) . However , the intracellular accumulation of FM4 - 64 within the same time frame was reduced in two chc2 mutant alleles ( chc2 - 1 and chc2 - 2 ) ( Figures 4E to 4G ) , suggesting that the endocytosis rate was reduced in these lines , corroborating our observations with HUB induction . Ontheotherhand , chc2 mutantsshowednodiscernible defect in PIN1 internalization after 1 h of BFA treatment ( see Supplemental Figure 5 online ) . This apparent discrepancy might be explained by a lower sensitivity of the BFA - based assay than that of the FM4 - 64 uptake assay . Alternatively , this could be indicative of a difference in endocytosis rate of PIN proteins compared with internalization of plasma membrane visualized by FM4 - 64 . Together with our dominant - negative approach , these genetic data demonstrate that clathrin is functionally involved in endocytosis in planta . The absence of defects in chc1 and only partial defects in chc2 mutants suggest a functional redundancy between both CHC genes . chc2 Mutants Are Defective in Embryonic and Postembryonic Development Given the prominent morphological defects observed after HUB induction , we analyzed chc mutant development . At the seedling stage , no phenotypic alterations were obvious for chc1 - 1 and chc1 - 2 single mutants . However , in two independent mutant alleles of chc2 , phenotypes reminiscent of mutants defective in polar auxin transport could be observed ( Okada et al . , 1991 ; Mayer et al . , 1993 ; Benjamins et al . , 2001 ; Friml et al . , 2002b ; Benkova´ et al . , 2003 ) . Most prominent among them was the defect in cotyledon organogenesis in ; 15 to 20 % of seedlings , varying from stick - shaped and collar - shaped to trumpet - shaped cotyledons , as commonly seen in auxin transport mutants ( Okada et al . , 1991 ; Benkova´ et al . , 2003 ; Friml et al . , 2003 ; Furutani et al . , 2004 ) ( Figures 5A to 5F , Table 2 ) . Moreover , chc2 seedlings with such stick - shaped cotyledons also had other auxin transport - related phenotypes : for example , the columella was highly disorganized compared with that of the wild type ( Figures 5G and 5H ) ( Sabatini et al . , 1999 ; Friml et al . , 2002b ) , and theauxin - inducedformation oflateralrootswaslesspronounced ( see Supplemental Figure 6 online ) ( Benkova´ et al . , 2003 ; Geldner et al . , 2004 ) . chc2 - 1 / chc2 - 2 transheterozygotes exhibited iden - tical developmental defects , demonstrating that the observed developmental defects are speciﬁc to chc2 mutation ( see Sup - plemental Table 1 online ) . During embryogenesis , a subset of chc2 mutant embryos had strongly defective patterning from the globular stage onward ( Figures 5I to 5N ) . Typically , aberrant cell division was discernible in the basal part of the mutant embryos , reminiscent of auxin transport mutants ( Friml et al . 2003 ) . Moreover , whereas wild - type embryos showed restricted DR5rev : GFP expression at the future root pole and tips of incipient cotyledons ( Figures 5O and 5P ) ( Benkova´ et al . , 2003 ) , mutant embryos had a broad DR5rev : GFP expression domain at their future root pole , while no ex - pression could be observed at sites where discrete cotyledons are formed ( Figure 5Q ) . Altogether , these ﬁndings imply that auxin transport is impaired in chc2 mutants . Clathrin Is Required for PIN Polarization The subcellular polar localization of PIN proteins provides vec - torial information to directional auxin transport ( Wis´niewska et al . , 2006 ) . Recently , endocytosis has been proposed to be a prerequisite for the establishment of PIN polarity ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2008a ) . Hence , theobserved defects in clathrin - dependent PIN endocytosis and auxin distribution prompted us to examine the polar localization of PIN proteins . Consistent with the speciﬁc requirement of CHC2 during embryogenesis , as demonstrated by cotyledon - patterning de - fects and ectopic auxin accumulation , chc2 embryos showed defects in polar PIN1 localization . From the heart stage onward , PIN1 accumulated at the basal side of vascular precursor cells of wild - type embryos , while a polarity pointing toward the tips of cotyledons was observed in the epidermal cells ( Figures 6A and 6B ) ( Benkova´ et al . , 2003 ) . In chc2 embryos , such a bilateral localization of PIN1 was largely disrupted , with increased cyto - solic background staining ( Figures 6C to 6F ) . To substantiate the effect on PIN polarity in a conditional situation , we examined the effects of RFP - HUB1 induction on PIN polarity in postembryonic roots . In the INTAM driver control roots , PIN1 localized to the basal ( lower ) side of vascular cells , whereas PIN2 localized apically ( upper ) in epidermal cells ( Figure 6G ) . InductionofINTAM > > RFP - HUB1duringgerminationchanged the polar localization of both PIN1 and PIN2 proteins into a more or less uniform apolar distribution at the plasma membrane of the cell types examined ( Figure 6H ) . These results demonstrate that clath - rin function is critical for the establishment of PIN polarity . Table 1 . Progeny of a Selfed chc1 - 1 / CHC1 ; chc2 - 2 / CHC2 Plant Genotype CHC1 CHC2 No .

Clathrin in Plant Cell Polarity 1925 DISCUSSION An Evolutionarily Conserved Clathrin - Dependent Mechanism Mediates Endocytosis in Plants For most nonplant model organisms , the involvement of clathrin has been demonstrated in several membrane trafﬁcking pro - cesses , most prominently in endocytosis ( Seeger and Payne , 1992 ; Deborde et al . , 2008 ; Kirchhausen , 2009 ) . Although plant ge - nomes encode molecular components of the clathrin - dependent trafﬁcking machinery , including clathrin heavy and light chains as well as putative components of the clathrin adaptor protein ma - chinery ( Holstein , 2002 ; Ortiz - Zapater et al . , 2006 ) , the physiolog - ical relevance of this pathway in planta has remained unclear . Here , we examined the consequences of genetic manipulation of clathrin function by either analyzing knockout lines for CHC genes or expressing dominant - negative CHC HUB in different tissues of the model plant Arabidopsis . Genetic interference with clathrin function not only inhibited trafﬁcking of tested plasma membrane proteins but also impaired the uptake of the endo - cytic tracer dye FM4 - 64 , highlighting the clathrin - dependent pathway as the dominant route for endocytosis in plants . These ﬁndings are consistent with observations in cultured plant cells ( Tahara et al . , 2007 ) and protoplasts ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ) . Figure 5 .

Besides clathrin - dependent endocytosis , clathrin - independent modes of endocytosis have been found in animals ( Howes et al . , 2010 ) , but it remains to be seen whether these pathways are also conserved in plants . Given the prominent effect of clathrin interference on endocytosis in plants , the other pathways , if operational in plants , are likely to have minor functions or be involved only in a subset of speciﬁc endocytic processes . Clathrin Function Is Required for Auxin - Dependent Growth and Patterning Clathrin function seems to be essential for plant life since lines lacking function of both CHC genes could not be recovered . Postembryonically , plants with impaired CHC function show a range of defects prominently including those indicative of de - fects in processes regulated by auxin . The spatio - temporal distribution of the plant hormone auxin is of fundamental importance for plant growth and development Table 2 .

One main route for regulating local auxin accumulation is through active directional transport medi - ated by polarly localized PIN auxin transporters ( Petra´sˇek et al . , 2006 ) . Their subcellular localization is instructive for the direction ofauxin ﬂow ( Wis´niewska etal . , 2006 ) butisnot static ( Friml etal . , 2002a , 2003 ; Benkova´ et al . , 2003 ; Abas et al . , 2006 ) , providing a ﬂexible system for quickly redirecting the auxin ﬂow . The mo - lecular basis for dynamic relocation of PIN polarity is rapid cycling of PIN proteins between the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments ( Geldner et al . , 2001 ; Kleine - Vehn et al . , 2008 ) . We found that disruption of clathrin function im - paired endocytosis of PIN proteins , causing altered patterns of auxin accumulation and increased auxin transport . Conse - quently , the chc loss - of - function mutants and dominant - negative CHC HUB - expressing plants exhibited various morphological defects , such as in embryonic patterning , in gravitropic growth , and in lateral root development . These phenotypes were remi - niscent of defects in auxin transport as observed in gnom and multiple pin mutants and / or plants treated with auxin transport inhibitors ( Friml et al . , 2003 ; Benkova´ et al . , 2003 ; Geldner et al . , 2004 ) . The auxin - related phenotypes do not fully explain the defects caused by impaired clathrin - dependent endocytosis , probably because many other plasma membrane proteins de - pend on this pathway for endocytosis . Moreover , clathrin , be - sides its involvement in endocytosis , might also act in protein sorting and degradation ; thus , part of the observed phenotypes might be attributed to defects in these processes . The dominant prevalence of auxin - related phenotypes is probably due to the strong impact of auxin distribution on plant growth and devel - opment and its profound dependence on constitutive endocytic recycling and retargeting of PIN auxin transporters . Mechanistic Basis for Clathrin - Mediated Endocytosis in Regulating PIN Polarity It is still not entirely clear what role PIN endocytic recycling has in auxin transport ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2008b ) . Besides a requirement for transcytosis - mediated changes in PIN polarity ( Kleine - Vehn et al . , 2008 , 2009 , 2010 ) , it has been also proposed that PIN polarity is established by initial nonpolar secretion followed by PIN endocytosis and polar recycling ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2008a ) . The genetic interference with clathrin function resulted in strong defects in PIN internalization associated with a defect in PIN polarity both in embryos and in postembryonic roots . These data imply a role for clathrin - mediated endocytosis in the two - step mechanism of PIN polarity establishment . However , we cannot entirely rule out that interference of clathrin function also causes intracellular trafﬁcking defects , independent of endocytosis but rather associated with altered polar secretion , as recently dem - onstrated in mammalian epithelial cells ( Deborde et al . , 2008 ) . An additional role of clathrin in polarity regulation might be related to the effect of auxin itself on clathrin - dependent PIN endocytosis ( Paciorek et al . , 2005 ; Robert et al . , 2010 ) . This mechanism accounts for a positive feedback loop of auxin on its own transport , but its role in PIN polarity establishment has not been demonstrated . Nonetheless , mathematical modeling sug - gests that feedback regulation of PIN endocytosis by extracel - lular auxin perception is capable of generating auxin - mediated cell and tissue polarity ( Wabnik et al . , 2010 ) . In conclusion , our results provide clear genetic evidence for the involvement of clathrin - dependent trafﬁcking in the estab - lishment of PIN polarity . We suggest the following updated model for generating and maintaining PIN polarity with clathrin - dependent PIN endocytosis integrated into a feedback circuit : ( 1 ) clathrin - dependent endocytosis , followed by polar recycling establishes polar PIN localization ; ( 2 ) asymmetrically localized PIN proteins direct polar auxin transport to generate a local auxin maximum ; and ( 3 ) transported auxin locally inhibits PIN endocy - tosis to stabilize PINs at the plasma membrane and reinforcing the PIN polarity . Given the functional relevance of clathrin in PIN endocytosis , an important mechanistic question remains : How do PIN pro - teins get recruited into the clathrin - mediated pathway ? In yeast and animals , cargo proteins bind to adaptors , causing confor - mational changes so that the cargo - adaptor complex can bind to the clathrin triskelion ( Kirchhausen , 2009 ) . Remarkably , pharma - cological inhibition of Tyr motif – based sorting is effective for plant adaptin ( Ortiz - Zapater et al . , 2006 ) and for PIN internaliza - tion ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ; Robert et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , it is tempting to speculate that a similar cargo - selecting mechanism may be involved in endocytosis of PIN proteins in planta , but this hypothesis awaits experimental proof . METHODS Plant Materials and Growth Conditions For analysis of seedling phenotypes , growth condition of plants was described elsewhere ( Tanaka et al . , 2009 ) . The transactivation line ( J0571 ) and T - DNA insertion lines were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre : chc1 - 1 ( SALK _ 112213 ) , chc1 - 2 ( SALK _ 103252 ) , chc2 - 1 ( SALK _ 028826 ) , and chc2 - 2 ( SALK _ 042321 ) ( Alonso etal . , 2003 ) . INTAM > > RFP - CHC1 ( HUB ) ( Robertetal . , 2010 ) and DR5rev : GFP ( Friml et al . , 2003 ) have been described previously . Genotypes of all insertion lines were conﬁrmed by PCR and further analyzed by RT - PCR . The primers used for genotyping were 112213RP and 112213LP for chc1 - 1 , P3 and 103252LP3 for chc1 - 2 , 28826RP and 28826LP for chc2 - 1 , and 042321LP2 and 042321RP3 for chc2 - 2 ( see Supplemental Table 2 online ) . The primers used for RT - PCR were P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , P5 , P6 , P7 , and P8 ( see Supplemental Table 2 online ) . The tubulin primers were as described ( Semiarti et al . , 2001 ) . Drug Treatment , Immunodetection , and Confocal Microscopy Treatment with BFA ( Molecular Probes ) , labeling with FM4 - 64 ( Molecular Probes ) , and immunodetection were as described previously ( Sauer et al . , 2006 ) using the following antibody dilutions : anti - PIN1 ( 1 : 1000 ) ( Paciorek et al . , 2005 ) , anti - PIN2 ( 1 : 1000 ) ( Abas et al . , 2006 ) , anti - CHC ( 1 : 1000 ) ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ) , anti - PM - ATPase ( 1 : 1000 ) ( Geldner et al . , 2001 ) , anti - ARF1 ( 1 : 1000 ) ( Tanaka et al . , 2009 ) , anti - rabbit - Alexa488 ( 1 : 600 ) ( Invitrogen ) , andanti - rabbit - Cy3 ( 1 : 600 ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Stock concentrations of 10 mM 4 - hydroxytamoxifen ( Sigma - Aldrich ) were prepared in dimethylsulfoxide and diluted 5000 - fold in half - strength Murashige and Skoog medium for inducing of INTAM : GAL4 expression . Confocal images were taken with SP2 ( Leica ) , FV1000 ( Olympus ) , or LSM5 Exciter ( Zeiss ) confocal microscopes . 1928 The Plant Cell Quantiﬁcation of FM4 - 64 Uptake The mean pixel intensity of the cytosolic side of cells , excluding the plasma membrane , and the mean pixel intensity of the adjacent plasma membrane was measured with ImageJ ( http : / / rsbweb . nih . gov / ij / ) , and the quotients of values between the inside and the plasma membrane were calculated . The value of each genotype was standardized to the corresponding wild - type control to evaluate the percentage of endo - cytosis inhibition compared with a wild - type condition ( Robert et al . , 2010 ) . Phenotype Analysis Three - day - old seedlings were transferred to media containing 5 m M 1 - naphthaleneaceticacid . After2dofauxintreatment , rootswerecleared ( Malamy and Benfey , 1997 ) and analyzed with differential interference contrast ( Olympus BX51 ) . Vascular patterns in cotyledons of 10 - d - old seedlings were observed by dark - ﬁeld illumination ( Leica MZ16 ) . Prior to observation , the cotyledons were cleared as following . Chlorophyll was removed from cotyledons of 10 - d - old seedlings by overnight incubation in ethanol ( 100 % ) followed by mounting on slides in lactic acid ( 70 % ) ( Acros Organics ) . Starch granules in the root tips were stained with Lugol’s solution for 1 to 2 min and then mounted on slides with chloral hydrate and analyzed immediately with differential interference contrast ( Olympus BX51 ) . Auxin Transport Assay Acropetal auxin transport was measured in 8 - d - old plants after the modiﬁed method of Rashotte et al . ( 2000 ) . Twenty - four hours before the assay started , the seedlings were transferred on half - strength Murashige and Skoog plates supplemented with 2 m M 4 - hydroxytamoxyfen ( Sigma - Aldrich ) or an equal amount of solvent ( DMSO ) . Warm agar at 1 . 5 % ( v / v ) was mixed with 200 nM 3 - [ 5 ( n ) - 3 H ] IAA ( 26 Ci / mmol ; Amersham ) , 100 nM cold indole - 3 - acetic acid ( IAA ) , and DMSO at a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 2 % ( v / v ) . Narrow stem glass transfer pipettes wereused to excise small cylinders out of the hardened agar mixture . Such agar cylinders were applied at the junction between the root and hypocotyl . The IAA transport was measured in vertically oriented plants after 18 h in the dark ( to minimizeIAAdegradation ) at22 8 C . Subsequently , theﬁrst1cmoftheroot after the [ 3 H ] IAA source was discarded , and the remaining root segment was used for analysis . Each root sample was placed into a mixture of 10 mL scintillation ﬂuid ( Lumasafe plus ; Luma - LSA ) and 1 mL water . Radi - oactivity was measured for 10 min using a scintillation counter ( model Tri - Carb 2800TR ; Perkin - Elmer ) . The experiment was repeated indepen - dently three times .
