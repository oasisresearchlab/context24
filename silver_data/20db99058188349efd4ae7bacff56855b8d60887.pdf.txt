Actin’s involvement in these processes is mediated by many actin - binding proteins , among which the cofilin family plays unique and essential role in accelerating actin treadmilling in filamentous actin ( F - actin ) in a nucleotide - state dependent manner . Cofilin preferentially interacts with older filaments by recognizing time - dependent changes in F - actin structure associated with the hydrolysis of ATP and release of inorganic phosphate ( P i ) from the nucleotide cleft of actin . The structure of cofilin on F - actin and the details of the intermolecular interface remain poorly understood at atomic resolution . Here we report atomic - level characterization by magic angle spinning ( MAS ) NMR of the muscle isoform of human cofilin 2 ( CFL2 ) bound to F - actin . We demonstrate that resonance assignments for the majority of atoms are readily accomplished and we derive the intermolecular interface between CFL2 and F - actin . The MAS NMR approach reported here establishes the foundation for atomic - resolution characterization of a broad range of actin - associated proteins bound to F - actin . Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells and is essential for numerous cellular functions , such as cellular division , cell motility , cell shape changes and mechanical support 1 . In these processes , actin func - tions in a tightly controlled equilibrium between G - ( globular ) and F - ( filamentous ) states ( Fig . 1a ) . ATP bound to G - actin is hydrolyzed upon polymerization in a time - dependent manner so that the younger part of the filament contains subunits in the ATP - and ADP - P i - states , while the older part is enriched in the ADP - bound subunits ( Fig . 1b ) . This “nucleotide clock” is recognized and amplified by actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) , among which ADF / cofilins are essential modulators and coordinators of actin dynamics 2 . There are three non - redundant iso - forms of human cofilins , namely actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) , cofilin 1 ( CFL1 ) , and cofilin 2 ( CFL2 ) , which differ in tissue distribution , physiological roles , and in the extent they affect actin dynamics . ADF / cofilins bind to ADP - G - actin with 10 – 50 fold higher affinity than to the ATP - G - actin 3 – 6 . A similar tendency is retained upon high - affinity cofilin binding to ADP - state ( older filament , higher affinity ) as opposed to its inefficient binding to ATP - and ADP - P i states ( younger filament , lower affinity ) of F - actin 5 , 7 – 9 . ADF / cofilins regulate actin dynamics by severing actin filaments at the boundaries between bare and coflin - decorated areas under sub - saturating con - centrations , while stabilizing F - actin in a new , cofilin - decorated state upon filament saturation 5 , 10 . In vertebrate actins , the severing appears to be mediated by a release of a cation ( Mg 2 + or K + under physiological conditions ) from a “stiffness” site between the D - loop and W - loop of two longitudinally adjacent actin subunits 11 . F - actin sev - ering by ADF / cofilins generates new ends and thereby , in coordination with other proteins ( e . g . twinfilin , Aip1 , CAP ) , overcomes slow depolymerization as the rate - limiting step in recycling of aged actin filaments . 1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , University of Delaware , Newark , Delaware 19716 , USA . 2 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH 43210 , USA . 3 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , University of California , Los Angeles , CA 90095 , USA . 4 Molecular Biology Institute , University of California , Los Angeles , CA 90095 , USA .

The structure of ADF / cofilins is highly conserved across all eukaryotic species . The core of ADF / cofilins is comprised of a five - stranded mixed β - sheet and is sur - rounded by five peripheral α - helices . The secondary structure elements are positioned in the following order : α 1 - α 2 - β 1 - β 2 - α 3 - β 3 - β 4 - α 4 - β 5 - α 5 - β 6 . The C - terminus of cofilins is folded in a compact β 6 - strand , which dis - tinguishes it from a less tightly packed C - terminus of ADF 12 ; this difference is translated to a lower affinity of the latter to F - actin . Structural and mutagenesis studies as well as mapping with synchrotron irradiation and chemical cross - linking 12 – 16 converged to realization that ADF / cofilins interact with actin via two major areas called G / F - and F - binding sites . The former is involved in binding to both monomeric and filamentous actin and is mainly composed of the N - terminal residues , and the kinked α 4 - helix . The N - terminus contains a major regulatory residue Ser3 , whose phosphorylation by LIM kinase 17 strongly inhibits binding of cofilins to G - and F - actin , as do point mutations at the N - terminus and in the α 4 - helix 12 , 18 , 19 . The F - actin binding site does not interact with G - actin , but is essential for binding to actin filaments ; respectively , mutations in this region ( e . g . K96Q 12 ) do not affect binding to monomeric actin , but block the ability of cofilin to affect F - actin dynamics . The unique role of ADF / coflins in actin dynamics is directly linked to its ability to induce dramatic structural perturbations in F - actin . Cofilin binding to F - actin promotes relative reorientation of the actin subunits leading to a change in a helical twist of the filament 20 , and an increase in its torsional and bending flexibility 21 , 22 . Cofilin modulates filament interaction with actin binding proteins via direct competition / cooperation , via allosteric influences , or both 23 – 26 . Recent cryo - EM reconstruction studies 13 revealed that reorientation of actin subunits is required to avoid steric clashes between the α 1 - and α 4 - helices of cofilin with actin subdomains 1 and 2 ( SD1 and SD2 ) , respectively . Thus , binding of cofilin causes a rotation of the outer domain of actin ( comprised of SD1 , 2 ) and weakens the interface between SD1 and SD2 of the longitudinally adjacent actin subunits . While these stud - ies yielded key insights , advanced understanding of cofilin - actin interaction and the molecular mechanism of cofilin - based actin remodeling requires atomic level structural information on these complexes , which is cur - rently lacking . In this report , we present atomic - resolution structural analysis of the muscle isoform of human cofilin ( CFL2 ) , bound to the α - skeletal isoform of mammalian F - actin , by magic angle spinning ( MAS ) NMR spectroscopy .

Among these , only CFL2 , the muscle - specific isoform of ADF / cofilins , was characterized in complex with F - actin by cryo - EM reconstruction at 9 Å resolution 13 , and therefore , was selected for this study . MAS NMR spectroscopy , which is emerging as a mainstream structural biology technique , has been applied to studies into cytoskeleton protein assemblies , such as determination of atomic - resolution structure and dynamics of CAP - Gly domain assembled with polymerized microtubules 33 , 34 , and an investigation of the polymorphism of myelin basic protein associated with actin microfilaments 35 . We have determined the chemical shifts and the secondary structure for the majority of cofilin residues . Using chemical shift perturbation analysis in conjunction with double - REDOR ( dREDOR ) filtered methods 36 , we have delineated the cofilin residues forming the interfaces with F - actin as well as residues that are affected allosterically . The outstanding spectral resolution enabled char - acterization of the cofilin / actin interactions with unprecedented level of detail . The study presented here opens doors for atomic - resolution structural characterization of assemblies formed by F - actin with cofilin / ADF family and other ABPs . Results And Discussion Resonance assignments of cofilin in complex with actin filaments . The negatively stained TEM image of the NMR sample containing U - 13 C , 15 N human CFL2 in complex with F - actin is shown in Fig . 1c . Formation of CFL2 / F - actin complex was confirmed by cosedimentation and SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 1d ) . To corrobo - rate that MAS NMR conditions do not interfere with the sample morphology , TEM images were collected prior to and after the NMR experiments . Spinning of the samples for extended periods of time does not appear to have any effect on the sample morphology . The samples of CFL2 / F - actin complexes yield outstanding - resolution MAS NMR spectra , as shown in Fig . 2 . For resonance assignments of cofilin in complex with actin filaments , a combination of 2D and 3D homo - and heteronuclear correlation MAS NMR spectra were acquired at 19 . 96 T Figure 2 . 2D and 3D MAS NMR spectra of CFL2 in complex with F - actin , acquired at 19 . 96 T ( 1 H Larmor frequency 850 MHz ) .

As shown in Fig . 2a , b and Table S1 ( Supplementary Information ) , remark - ably high spectral resolution of 2D and 3D spectra permitted de novo resonance assignments of 111 out of 166 residues . Figure 2b displays a backbone walk from D9 - N16 using 3D NUS NCOCX and NCACX datasets . The majority of backbone resonances are present in the spectra with the exception of termini residues ( M1 , P165 , L166 ) , several sequence stretches in loop regions spanning residues K30 – K34 , V72 - D79 , G130 - Q136 , and ran - dom individual residues throughout the sequence ( Fig . 2c and Table S1 ) . These assignments were also corrobo - rated by comparison with solution shifts of free cofilin . Intermolecular interface and allosteric changes in cofilin upon binding to F - actin . To determine the intermolecular interface of CFL2 in complex with F - actin , we have pursued two approaches : ( i ) chemical shift perturbation analysis , and ( ii ) dREDOR - filter - based experiments allowing for a direct determination of inter - molecular dipolar contacts between cofilin and actin filament . This combined analysis yields information on the intermolecular interface and on residues experiencing allosteric changes as the result of the complex formation . To probe conformational changes in CFL2 upon binding to F - actin , we have analyzed chemical shift pertur - bations ( CSPs ) in free cofilin vs . its complex with F - actin . Since atomic - resolution structure of CFL2 is not yet available , all residues identified in the present study were mapped onto the structure of homologous human CFL1 ( PDB 1Q8G ) and compared with the cryo - EM reconstruction of CFL2 / F - actin complex 13 . The results , summa - rized in Fig . 3 , suggest that the previous assumption that cofilin binds to F - actin as a rigid body are incorrect . Indeed , very large chemical shift perturbations ( > 2 ppm ) are observed for over 27 % of all residues , particu - larly those at the N - terminus ( residues S3 , G4 , V5 , T6 ) , in α 1 - helix ( residues D9 , V11 – V14 , K19 - R21 ) , β 2 - and β 3 - strands ( residues L40 , Q46 , A52 , Q54 , L55 ) , α 3 – helix ( residues D66 , T69 , S70 ) , β 4 - and β 5 - strands ( residues D79 , T88 , L99 - F101 , F103 ) , α 4 – helix ( residues K114 , I116 , S119 , S120 , D122 , A123 , I124 , K125 , K127 ) , the 3 10 helix ( D141 ) , and loop residues ( D43 , K44 , V57 , T129 , and I142 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Among these , the α 4 – helix residues K114 , I116 , I124 , K125 , K127 were previously identified to exhibit CSPs upon interaction with G - actin 12 , while most others appear to be specific for binding to F - actin . There are only few residues with strong G - actin induced CSPs 12 that do not show or show only minor , less than 1 ppm differences , upon binding to F - actin , and most of them are either not conserved between the two cofilins ( e . g . , A / V137 , C / G139 in CFL1 / 2 , respectively ) or located nearby the non - conserved residues ( e . g . , the E134 preceding the non - conserved L / Y135 ) . Since all three residues are located at the actin interface , these changes may contribute to difference in actin - binding properties between CFL1 and CFL2 9 . The above strong chemical shift perturbations indicate that the corresponding residues either comprise the intermolecular interface with F - actin or undergo allosteric conformational changes upon formation of the com - plex . To discriminate between those possibilities and identify cofilin residues located at the interface with F - actin , we employed a dREDOR filtered approach 33 . In this method , simultaneous 1 H - 13 C / 1 H - 15 N REDOR filter dephases all cofilin protons that are directly bonded to either 13 C or 15 N atoms ( i . e . , 1 H belonging to the U - 13 C , 15 N - cofilin ) . The remaining protons , belonging to the interface regions of unlabeled actin , are then used to transfer magnet - ization to cofilin through 1 H - 15 N or 1 H - 13 C cross polarization across the intermolecular interface followed by HETCOR or CORD mixing . The resulting spectrum contains specific information about the residues forming intermolecular interface . We note that dREDOR based experiment is the only approach to identify intermolecular interfaces when chemical shift perturbations are small , such as in cofilin / actin complex here or CAP - Gly / micro - tubule complex studied by us previously 33 . To perform residue assignments of cofilin residues at the interface , this experiment is implemented as a 2D dREDOR - CORD sequence ( Fig . 4a ) . G / F - actin binding sites on cofilin . The dREDOR - based measurements reveal both the G / F - and F - bind - ing sites on the cofilin surface ( representing binding to subunits “n” and “n + 2” in the filament , respectively ) to previously unprecedented level of detail . On the basis of the dREDOR - CORD experiment , we confirmed that the G / F - binding site includes the N - terminus ( residues S3 , G4 and V6 ) and the N - terminal half of the bent α 4 - helix ( residues M115 and I116 ) preceding the kink . Interestingly , the entire actin - binding surface of the α 4 - helix appears to be shifted towards its C - terminus as compared to that observed in the crystal structure of Figure 3 . ( a ) C α chemical shift perturbations between free CFL2 and CFL2 / F - actin . Residues present in dREDOR experiments of CFL2 / F - actin are shown with blue bars above the plot and labeled in blue . Chemical shifts of free CFL2 were determined by solution NMR experiments . Chemical shifts of CFL2 / F - actin complexes were determined by MAS NMR experiments . ( b ) The residues constituting the corresponding chemical shift perturbations are mapped onto the CFL1 structure ( PDB 1Q8G ) . Chemical shift perturbations between 2 – 4 ppm are shown in yellow and chemical shift perturbations above 4 ppm are shown in red . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 5 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 44506 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep44506 G - actin with an ADF / cofilin homology domain represented by the C - terminal domain of twinfilin 14 , thus far the only atomic resolution structure of actin - cofilin complex available . Indeed , the N - terminal residues of the α 4 - helix that constitute the essential part of the G / F - binding site in the C - twinfilin structure ( 266 - IRER - 269 corresponding to 111 - LKSK - 114 in human CFL2 ) are not present in the dREDOR - CORD spectra . On the other hand , the data indicate that residues A123 , I124 , K127 , T129 at the C - terminal part of the kinked α 4 - helix , which are not at the G - actin / C - twinfilin interface , are part of the interface in the CFL2 / F - actin complex . Residues located in the corresponding part of the α 4 - helix of budding yeast cofilin were found by mutagenesis to be essen - tial for cofilin function in vivo 18 and were recognized to be affected upon binding to G - actin in synchrotron oxi - dation experiments 15 and in solution NMR studies 12 , see Fig . 5 . The fact that strong signals corresponding to these residues are found in dREDOR spectra suggests that actin is directly involved in interaction with the terminal part of the α 4 - helix . It remains to be determined whether the differences observed in the various studies reflect variations in actin - binding modes between the ADF - homology domains of C - twinfilin and cofilin , or between interaction of cofilins with G - vs F - actin , or even between binding of cofilin to ATP - ( the X - ray structure ) vs ADP - actin ( present work ) . It is also possible that these additional residues contribute to a new F - actin binding site , by being possibly involved in binding to the D - loop of a longitudinally adjacent actin subunit ( “n + 2” ) , as it can be speculated based on the proximity of these elements in the cryo - EM reconstruction of F - actin with Figure 4 . Intermolecular interface of human CFL2 bound to F - actin from MAS NMR . ( a ) dREDOR - CORD spectra for human CFL2 in complex with F - actin .

The first contour is set at 5x the noise level . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 6 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 44506 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep44506 CFL2 13 . According to the dREDOR results , other residues that might contribute to the G / F - site ( i . e . to binding to the “n + 2” subunit in the filament ) are L40 , S41 , Q46 , A105 , A109 , V137 , N138 , which overall is in agreement with previous findings 12 , 14 , 15 , 18 . F - actin binding sites on cofilin . To date , the most comprehensive data on the F - site composition origi - nated from a restrained refinement model obtained by fitting atomic - resolution structures of CFL1 ( PDB 1Q8G ) and actin ( PDB 2BTF ) to a 9 Å resolution cryo - EM map density of human CFL2 with rabbit skeletal actin 13 . The dREDOR - CORD spectra ( Fig . 6 ) are in excellent agreement with the cryo - EM reconstruction data , and reveal the three major patches of the F - site ( to subunit “n + 2” in F - actin ) ( Fig . 6 ) . The first patch is defined by residues 19 – 21 ( also recognized in the cryo - EM study ) and 24 – 26 . It is reasonable to speculate that the latter patch can be involved in binding to the N - terminus of actin as these elements are proximal to each other in the cryo - EM reconstruction 13 . The loop comprised by residues 24 – 32 is present in vertebrates , from fish to human , but not in drosophila , yeast , or plant cofilins . This loop contains a nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) essential for active trans - location of G - actin - cofilin complexes to the nucleus 37 . Involvement of the 24 – 32 loop in interaction with F - , but not G - actin , suggests a possible mechanism of discriminative recognition of free cofilin and actin - cofilin com - plexes by nuclear importins . Furthermore , phosphorylation of S23 and / or S24 by PKC α reduces ability of cofilin to bind F - actin and to modify actin dynamics both in vitro and in vivo 38 . Given a highly acidic nature of actin’s N - terminus , it is reasonable to suggest an electrostatic repulsive mechanism for such inhibition . Therefore , this site represents regulation at the F - actin level , as opposed to the G / F - level regulation via phosphorylation at S3 . The second patch of the F - site is composed of residues 91 , 93 – 96 , and 99 , 100 ( residues 94 – 98 in the cryo - EM study ) within the loop connecting β 4 - β 5 strands and the N - terminal half of β 5 - strand . The third patch encom - passes residues 153 , 157 – 160 , and 163 at the C - terminus of cofilin ( defined as residues 154 – 158 by Galkin et al . 13 . ) . It was speculated that overall tighter folding and stronger binding of this regions to F - actin defines the major structural and functional differences between cofilin and ADF 12 . In addition to these well - defined patches , dREDOR spectra revealed residues T63 , T69 , S70 , which are located at the surface opposite to actin binding sites . Figure 5 .

Among few cofilin residues with large chemical shift perturbations that are not in proximity of residues in dREDOR spectra , V57 ( ~ 8 ppm ) , D141 , V143 ( 4 – 6 ppm ) , C80 ( ~ 2 ppm ) , and T88 ( > 2 ppm ) , are par - ticularly notable ( see Fig . 3 ) . Their unusually large CSPs correlate with localization in loops ( V57 , C80 and T88 ) and , therefore , likely reflect flexibility of the corresponding loop regions , or with localization at the actin - cofilin interface ( D141 , I143 ) not identified by the dREDOR spectra . Indeed , D141 and D142 of CFL2 correspond to E141 and E142 in CFL1 sequence . This difference was recently implicated as a likely source of different affinities of the two cofilins to ATP - actin 9 . In addition , high CSP of C80 likely reflects changes in the oxidation state of this residue ( reduced in free cofilin and oxidized in complex with actin , according to the 13 C α / C β chemical shifts 39 ) . Additional insights into the nature of the changes described by the large chemical shift perturbations will be gained from the atomic - resolution MAS NMR structure of CFL2 bound to actin , which is forthcoming . Conclusions We reported atomic - resolution structural investigation of the human CFL2 complex with F - actin , by MAS NMR spectroscopy . Using a combination of chemical shift perturbation analysis and dREDOR - based methods , we have determined the cofilin residues comprising the interfaces with F - actin as well as residues affected allosterically . The outstanding spectral resolution enabled characterization of the cofilin / actin interactions with unprecedented level of detail . Broadly , MAS NMR approach reported here is applicable to the analysis of actin - binding proteins bound to filamentous actin that otherwise are not amenable to atomic - resolution studies through other current techniques .

G - actin was switched from Ca 2 + - to Mg 2 + - bound state by 10 - min incubation with 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 4 mM EGTA and polymerized by addition of buffer containing 20 mM PIPES , pH 6 . 8 , 25 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM β - mercaptoethanol . Preparation of U - 13 C , 15 N - cofilin / F - actin complex . For the preparation of MAS NMR samples , U - 13 C , 15 N - CFL2 and F - actin were mixed at a 1 : 1 . 2 molar ratio and centrifuged at 90 , 000 rpm ( RCF 435 , 400 g ) at 4 °C for 1 hour in a TLA 120 . 2 rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima MAX - XP ultracentrifuge following overnight incubation on ice . The gel - like pellet was transferred into a 1 . 9 mm Bruker rotor . 14 . 3 mg of hydrated U - 13 C , 15 N - cofilin / actin complexes containing an estimated 3 mg of isotopically labeled cofilin were packed into 1 . 9 mm Bruker rotors . Transmission Electron Microscopy . The U - 13 C , 15 N - cofilin / actin sample morphology was verified by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . Actin samples were stained with uranyl acetate ( 5 % w / v ) , deposited on 400 mesh , formvar / carbon - coated copper grids , and dried . The TEM images were acquired by a Zeiss Libra 120 transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV . Solution NMR Spectroscopy . Solution NMR spectra were acquired on a 14 . 1 T ( 1 H Larmor frequency of 600 . 1 MHz ) Bruker AV spectrometer using a triple - resonance inverse detection ( TXI ) probe . All spectra of U - 13 C , 15 N - cofilin were recorded at 298 K . Backbone and C β resonance assignments of U - 13 C , 15 N cofilin were car - ried out using heteronuclear 2D 1 H - 15 N HSQC and 3D HNCACB , HNCA , HNCO , HNCACO at 298 K . MAS NMR Spectroscopy . MAS NMR spectra were acquired on a 19 . 96 T Bruker AVIII instrument using a 1 . 9 mm HCN probe . The Larmor frequencies were 850 . 4 MHz ( 1 H ) , 213 . 8 MHz ( 13 C ) and 86 . 2 MHz ( 15 N ) . The MAS frequency was 14 kHz , controlled to within ± 10 Hz by a Bruker MAS controller . The temperature was cal - ibrated using KBr as the temperature sensor . The actual temperature at the sample was 273 K and maintained to within ± 0 . 1 °C using a Bruker temperature controller . 13 C and 15 N chemical shifts were referenced with respect to the external standards adamantane and NH 4 Cl , respectively . Dipolar - based 2D and 3D NCACX and NCOCX experiments were acquired using non - uniform sampling ( NUS ) . The random exponentially weighted NUS schedules were employed , see Supplementary Information 42 , 43 . The 3D spectra were acquired with 25 % NUS using 48 complex points in the t 1 and t 2 indirect dimensions , with maximum evolution times of 3 . 4 ms and 6 . 9 ms for 13 C and 15 N , respectively . The spectra were processed using the MINT reconstruction protocol 42 . The signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) of the 2D NCACX and NCOCX were 14 and 13 , respectively . The SNR for the 2D 13 C - 13 C CORD is 15 . The first contour level was set to 5X the noise level for all spectra . The uncertainties in the solid - state chemical shifts are ± 0 . 3 ppm . The typical 90° pulse lengths were 2 . 75 μ s , 2 . 95 μ s for 13 C , and 3 . 3 μ s for 15 N . The 1 H - 13 C and 1 H - 15 N CP employed a linear amplitude ramp for 80 – 100 % : the 1 H RF field was 91 kHz ; and the center of the ramp on the 13 C or 15 N was Hartmann - Hahn matched to the first spinning sideband . In 2D and 3D NCACX experiments , the RF field strengths were 64 . 9 kHz , 84 . 7 kHz and 91 kHz for 15 N , 13 C and 1 H channels , respectively . The DARR mixing sequence was applied to the 1 H channel and the DARR mixing time was 50 ms . The 1 H decoupling powers were 90 – 100 kHz during acquisition and evolution periods in all experiments . For 2D 13 C - 13 C CORD correlation experiments 44 , the typical 90° pulse lengths were 2 . 55 μ s for 1 H , and 2 . 3 μ s for 13 C . The 1 H - 13 C CP employed a tangent amplitude ramp of 80 – 100 % , the 1 H RF field was 75 kHz , and the center of the ramp of the 13 C Hartmann - Han matched the first spinning sideband . The RF field on the 1 H channel was matched to the MAS frequency ( 14 kHz ) and one half of it ( 7 kHz ) during the 50 ms mixing time . The typical decoupling power was 90 – 100 kHz during the acquisition and evolution . The spectral width was 299 . 75 ω 2 and 213 . 83 in ω 1 with the carrier frequency set to 96 . 2 ppm . The double - REDOR ( dREDOR ) filtered experiments on U - 13 C , 15 N - CFL2 bound to F - actin employed simul - taneous 1 H - 13 C / 1 H - 15 N REDOR dephasing periods of 714 μ s , to eliminate signals from 1 H ( all protons in CFL2 ) directly bound to 13 C and 15 N 33 . The CP contact time was 5 ms and the CORD mixing time was 50 ms . To rule out the possibility that certain signals in the dREDOR based spectra may be artifacts arising from dynamic residues due to insufficient suppression of 1 H spin polarization , control experiments were conducted as described in our report 45 . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 9 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 44506 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep44506 References 1 .
