In this context , we designed a solid oral formulation of oxaliplatin ( OP ) , a third - generation cisplatin analog , to improve oral bioavailability and investigate its application in metronomic chemotherapy . Methods : An ion - pairing complex of OP with a permeation enhancer , N α - deoxycholyl - L - lysyl - methylester ( DLM ) , was successfully prepared and then mixed with dispersing agents ( including poloxamer 188 and Labrasol ) to form the solid , amorphous oral formula - tion OP / DLM ( OP / DLM - SF ; hereafter , ODSF ) . Results : The optimized powder formulation was sized in the nanoscale range ( 133±1 . 47 nm ) . The effective permeability of OP increased by 12 . 4 - fold after ionic complex formation with DLM and was further increased by 24 . 0 - fold after incorporation into ODSF . ODSF exhibited respective increases of 128 % and 1010 % in apparent permeability across a Caco - 2 monolayer , compared to OP / DLM and OP . Furthermore , inhibition of bile acid transporters by actinomycin D and caveola - mediated uptake by brefeldin in Caco - 2 cell monolayers reduced the apparent permeability values of ODSF by 58 . 4 % and 51 . 1 % , respectively , suggesting predominant roles for bile acid transporters and caveola - mediated transport in intestinal absorption of ODSF . In addition , macropinocytosis and paracellular and transcel - lular passive transport significantly influenced the intestinal permeation of ODSF . The oral bioavailabilities of ODSF in rats and monkeys were 68 . 2 % and 277 % higher , respectively , than the oral bioavailability of free OP . In vivo analyses of anticancer efficacy in CT26 and HCT116 cell - bearing mice treated with ODSF demonstrated significant suppression of tumor growth , with respective maximal tumor volume reductions of 7 . 77 - fold and 4 . 07 - fold , compared to controls . Conclusion : ODSF exhibits therapeutic potential , constituting an effective delivery system that increases oral bioavailability , with applications to metronomic chemotherapy .

This use of drug - free periods may lead to the regrowth of tumor cells through the mobilization of circulating endothelial progenitor cells , thereby resulting in tumor neovascularization . 2 , 3 To improve treatment efficacy and prolong the survival of cancer patients , there is a need for intensive research regard - ing new targets and treatment strategies to fight cancer . In particular , low - dose chronic administration of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs without drug - free intervals ( ie , metronomic chemotherapy ) shows strong anti - angiogenic activity , along with reduction of toxic effects and inhibition of vascular rebound . 1 , 3 In addition , metronomic chemother - apy has the potential to promote the initiation or persistence of a tumor - targeting immune response by activation of natural killer cells and preferential targeting of both mye - loid - derived suppressor cells and T - regulatory cells . 4 However , successful implementation of metronomic administration is facilitated by oral administration alone , not by daily IV injections . Administration of chemothera - peutic agents via the oral route has several strengths : it minimizes the limitations of conventional chemotherapy , preserves quality of life , and modulates drug release from the dosage form , thereby yielding favorable pharmacoki - netics during prolonged treatment . 5 , 6 However , oral admin - istration of chemotherapeutic agents presents multiple challenges due to the physicochemical properties of the drugs and biological barriers to drug delivery , including low aqueous solubility , poor intestinal membrane perme - ability , high P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) efflux , low or variable bioavailability , gastrointestinal side effects , limited dose options , novel toxicity profiles , and potential difficulty with treatment adherence . 5 , 7 , 8 Notably , several novel stra - tegies are currently under investigation to overcome these challenges and improve oral bioavailability . 9 – 13 Platinum - based chemotherapeutics are the corner - stones of cancer treatment and have been widely used in clinical practice . The third - generation platinum analo - gue , oxaliplatin ( cis - [ ( 1R , 2R ) - 1 , 2 - cyclohexanediamine - N , N’ ] [ oxalato ( 2 ) - O , O´ ] platinum ; OP ) is used for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer . Structurally , OP consists of a central platinum atom surrounded by an oxalate ion and 1 , 2 - diaminocyclohexane in the trans position ; this drug exhibits its cytotoxic activity by forming intra - and inter - strand crosslinks between two adjacent guanine residues or a guanine or an adenine , thereby interfering with DNA replication and transcrip - tion machinery through nuclear DNA adduct formation . 14 , 15 Although OP has a better safety profile than other platinum - containing compounds , such as cis - platin and carboplatin , its therapeutic use remains limited because of its toxicity profile and unfavorable pharmacokinetics . 16 , 17 The US Food and Drug Administration approved OP as first - line chemotherapy , in combination with 5 - fluorouracil , for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer . 18 OP has also been identified as a promising anticancer drug for patients unresponsive to other platinum compounds and 5 - fluorouracil ; impor - tantly , it has fewer side effects than the other platinum compounds . 19 , 20 In addition , treatment of colorectal can - cer in mice with OP evokes the presentation of damage - associated molecular patterns within cancer cells and induces immunogenic cell death ; thus , OP exhibits immunostimulatory potential . 21 , 22 Moreover , the immu - nostimulatory efficacy of OP in mice depends on gram - positive bacteria in the intestinal microbiota , as evidenced by the suppression of proinflammatory genes in the absence of microbiota . 23 , 24 However , given its low aqueous solubility and poor intestinal membrane perme - ability , the oral bioavailability of OP is low . 25 To address these issues , several strategies have been studied , includ - ing ion - pairing complex formation with bile acid deriva - tives , coadministration with biodegradable polymers or solubility and permeation enhancers , and formulation of thermosensitive liposomes and nanoparticles . 19 , 20 , 26 , 27 Among the abovementioned strategies , Urbanska et al developed an oral formulation of OP for the treatment of colorectal cancer , whereby OP was first loaded into nano - particles consisting of polymeric molecules and further encapsulated in microsized alginate - based particles ; this resulted in pH - sensitive , mucoadhesive , chitosan - coated , alginate microspheres . The study demonstrated significant suppression of tumor growth progression and improve - ment of morbidity , compared to the control group , in an orthotopic mouse model of colorectal cancer . 28 Bile salts and their derivatives have been studied as potential absorption enhancers due to their atypical physi - cochemical properties and biocompatibility . 29 , 30 In addi - tion , bile acid acts as a solubilizer for drug molecules , helps to overcome barriers of the gastrointestinal route , and assists in the transport of complexed molecules ( phy - sical or chemical ) across biological membranes . 29 , 30 Pangeni et al Dovepress submit your manuscript | www . dovepress . com DovePress International Journal of Nanomedicine 2020 : 15 7720 Several studies have suggested that the conjugation of bile acids with amino acids may reduce the precipitation of bile acids and increase the hydrophilicity of bile acid deriva - tives ; it may also reduce the cytotoxic and membranolytic properties of bile acids . 31 , 32 Previously , we reported that a positively charged bile acid derivative , N α - deoxycholyl - L - lysyl - methylester ( DLM ; prepared by the chemical link - age of sodium deoxycholate [ DC ] with L - lysine [ Lys ] ) , increased the intestinal absorption and oral bioavailability of various polar and hydrophilic drugs , including OP , pemetrexed , bisphosphonates , and insulin . 33 – 35 This sig - nificant increase in intestinal permeability may be due to enhanced uptake of the drug / DLM complex through bile acid transporters in the gastrointestinal lumen , avoidance of DLM dilution in gastrointestinal fluid , and elevation of the concentration gradient through the intestinal membrane . 36 , 37 Recently , we constructed an ion - pairing complex of OP with DLM to form OP / DLM , then incor - porated the complex into multiple water - in - oil - in - water nanoemulsions with 5 - fluorouracil ; this yielded significant increases in the intestinal membrane permeability and oral bioavailability of OP . 26 The elevated oral absorption of OP may have resulted from increased lipophilicity of the drug by DLM , uptake of OP / DLM by the bile acid transporter , and surfactant - and bile acid derivative - induced changes in membrane fluidity . However , to further improve the stabi - lity and oral bioavailability of OP , an oral powder formu - lation of OP was necessary . Here , we focus on the design of a stable oral powder formulation of OP by incorporating the ion - pairing complex of OP and DLM . To achieve this goal , OP was ionically complexed with DLM in combination with Labrasol and poloxamer 188 ( P188 ) as dispersants , thus forming ODSF . This powder formulation was expected to increase the oral bioavailability of OP due to the enhanced lipophilic properties of OP , formation of stable self - assembling micelles in aqueous solution , dispersant activity of P188 , opening of intestinal membrane tight junctions ( TJs ) , and change in the membrane fluidity by Labrasol ; these effects were presumed to enhance oral absorption of the drug . Artificial membrane and Caco - 2 cell monolayer permeability of ODSF were evaluated to con - firm the elevated oral absorption of OP . In addition , the intest - inal transport pathways followed by ODSF to improve oral absorption were studied in Caco - 2 cell monolayers , using specific pharmacological inhibitors . Finally , the oral bioavail - ability of ODSF in rats and monkeys , and tumor growth inhibition during oral metronomic chemotherapy of mice bearing mouse and human colon cancer cells were evaluated .

Then , 10 mL of DLM solution in deionized water ( 3 . 6 mg / mL ) was prepared and added dropwise to the OP solution at a molar ratio of 1 : 2 ( OP : DLM ) ; vortex mixing was performed after each 1 - mL addition . The solution mixture of OP and DLM was freeze - dried at – 70°C to obtain OP / DLM powder . To further enhance the intestinal membrane permeability of OP , an oral powder formulation of OP / DLM was prepared using the solid dispersion technique . Briefly , 12 . 5 mg of OP was dissolved in 12 . 5 mL of P188 solution ( 125 mg of P188 in 10 mL of deionized water ) containing 93 . 75 µL of Labrasol . Next , 36 mg of DLM was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water and added dropwise to the OP solution at a molar ratio of 1 : 2 , with continuous stirring . The mixture was then freeze - dried at – 70°C to completely remove the water and obtain an OP / DLM powder formulation . Separately , to determine the role of DLM in enhancing the intestinal membrane permeability of OP , an oral powder formulation of OP without DLM was prepared , using Labrasol and P188 as dispersants . Briefly , 12 . 5 mg of OP was dissolved in 12 . 5 mL of P188 solution ( 10 mg / mL in deionized water ) containing 93 . 75 µL of Labrasol . The mix - ture was vortexed for 5 min and freeze - dried at – 70°C to completely remove water and obtain OP - SF in powder form . Physical State and Physicochemical Characterization of ODSF To confirm the formation of an OP – DLM ionic complex , the crystalline properties of OP ; DLM ; P188 ; OP / DLM ; ODSF ; and a physical mixture of OP , DLM , and P188 were compared using powder X - ray diffraction ( PXRD ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) . PXRD peaks were measured using a diffractometer ( D8 Advance ; Bruker AXS GmbH , Karlsruhe , Germany ) operated at 40 mA and 40 kV ; the Cu - Kα1 line at λ = 1 . 5418 Å served as the radiation source . Powder samples were packed and prepared in an aluminum specimen holder . Each sample was scanned via step - scan mode in a 2 - theta ( 2θ ) range of 3°≤2θ≤50° at a scan rate of 0 . 02° / s , using an automatic divergence slit assembly with a proportional detector . Sample scanning was performed at 25°C . Thermal analyses were performed using a DSC instrument ( Q1000 V9 . 9 Build 303 ; TA Instruments Inc . , New Castle , DE , USA ) . Approximately 2 mg of each powder was transferred to an aluminum crucible and non - hermetically sealed . The DSC scans ran from 25°C to 350°C at 5°C / min in a nitrogen atmosphere . Next , the average particle sizes and polydispersity indices ( PDIs ) of the optimum oral powder formulation of OP and individual excipients ( eg , DLM , P188 , and Labrasol ) were measured based on the dynamic light scat - tering technique ; the zeta potentials of OP / DLM and ODSF were measured using an analyzer ( Zetasizer Nano ZS90 ; Malvern Instruments , Malvern , UK ) at 25°C . The ODSF was dispersed in deionized water ( 1 : 20 , w / v ) , then soni - cated for 1 min to minimize multiple scattering effects . In addition , the shape , surface morphology , and particle size of ODSF were determined by high - resolution transmission electron microscopy . The optimum formulation was diluted with deionized water ( 1 : 100 , v / v ) , dropped onto a copper grid , and then negatively stained with 2 % ( w / v ) phospho - tungstic acid solution . Excess solution was removed with filter paper and the grid was observed using a transmission electron microscope ( JEM - 200 ; JEOL , Tokyo , Japan ) . In vitro Artificial Intestinal Membrane Permeability of ODSF Permeability studies of free OP , OP / DLM , OP - SF , and ODSF through an artificial membrane were performed using a parallel artificial membrane permeability assay ( PAMPA ; BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) in the same manner as described previously . 38 Briefly , 300 µL phosphate - buffered saline ( pH 6 . 8 ) was added to the accep - tor compartment , and 200 µL free OP , OP / DLM , OP - SF , or ODSF diluted to a concentration of 200 µg / mL in phos - phate - buffered saline ( pH 6 . 8 ) was added to each donor compartment . The acceptor and donor plates were sand - wiched , while ensuring that the underside of the membrane was in contact with the acceptor solution . Then , the entire system was incubated for 5 h at 25°C . Following incuba - tion , the PAMPA plate sandwich was separated and samples were withdrawn from both the donor and acceptor plates . The concentrations of OP or OP / DLM permeated through the artificial membrane were measured via HPLC using a C18 column ( 4 . 6×250 mm , 5 µm , 100 Å ) at 40°C . The mobile phase consisted of water ( pH 3 . 0 , adjusted with phosphoric acid ) – acetonitrile ( 99 : 1 , v / v ) and ran at a flow rate of 1 . 2 mL / min . The injection volume was 20 µL ; Pangeni et al Dovepress submit your manuscript | www . dovepress . com DovePress International Journal of Nanomedicine 2020 : 15 7722 measurement was performed using a UV detector at 210 nm . The concentration data were used to calculate the effective permeability ( P e ) of each drug as follows : P e ( ×10 −6 cm / s ) = – ln [ 1 – C A ( t ) / C eq ] / [ A× ( 1 / V D + 1 / V A ) ×t ] ×10 −6 , where P e is the effective permeability ( cm / s ) , A is the filter insert area ( 0 . 228 cm 2 ) , V D is the volume of the donor well ( 0 . 2 mL ) , V A is the volume of the receptor well ( 0 . 3 mL ) , t is the total incubation time in seconds , C A ( t ) denotes the concentration of drug in the receptor well at time t , and C eq was calculated using the following equation : [ C D ( t ) ×V D + C A ( t ) ×V A ] / ( V D + V A ) , where C D ( t ) denotes the concentra - tion of drug in the donor well at time t . In vitro Permeability Across a Caco - 2 Monolayer ODSF The in vitro human intestinal Caco - 2 cell monolayer per - meability assay was performed as described previously . 26 Briefly , aliquots of approximately 1×10 5 cells / well ( Caco - 2 cells ; ATCC ® HTB - 37™ ) were seeded onto each 24 - well Transwell ® filter insert ( pore size 0 . 4 μm , surface area 0 . 33 cm 2 ; Corning Incorporated , Corning , NY , USA ) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( Lonza , Basel , Switzerland ) containing 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( Gibco / Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and 1 % penicillin / strep - tomycin ( Gibco / Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Media in both the apical and basolateral chambers were changed on alternate days up to day 8 , then daily from day 9 onwards . Cells were allowed to grow and differentiate ; at day 16 , the integrity of the Caco - 2 cell monolayer was evaluated by measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance ( TEER ) using an Epithelial Volt - Ohm Meter ( Millicell ® ERS - 2 ; Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) . Caco - 2 cell mono - layers with TEER values > 350 Ω·cm 2 were used for experiments to measure the permeabilities of free OP , OP / DLM , OP - SF , and ODSF . Prior to the assay , media on both apical and basolateral compartments were removed and replaced with 0 . 1 mL and 0 . 6 mL prewarmed ( 37°C ) Hanks’ balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) , respec - tively , and equilibrated for 20 min in an incubator at 37° C . Next , HBSS in the basolateral compartment was removed and replaced with 0 . 6 mL fresh HBSS ; the med - ium in the apical compartment was replaced with 0 . 1 mL free OP , OP / DLM , OP - SF , or ODSF diluted in HBSS ( equivalent to 100 µg / mL OP ) . Then , the plates were incubated at 37°C and samples ( 100 µL ) were taken from the basolateral compartment after 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 h ; they were replaced with the same volume of fresh HBSS . In addition , the apical solution was collected after 5 h . Then , each collected sample was filtered through a polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membrane filter ( 0 . 45 µm ) ; the concentrations of OP or OP / DLM that permeated through the Caco - 2 monolayer were determined using the HPLC system with a UV detector , as described above . The apparent permeability coefficient ( P app ) of OP or OP / DLM was calculated using the following equation : P app = dQ / dt×1 / ( A×C 0 ) , where dQ / dt indicates the linear appearance rate of mass in the basolateral compartment ( μg / s ) , C 0 is the initial concentration of OP or OP / DLM in the apical compartment ( μg / mL ) , and A is the surface area of the monolayer membrane ( cm 2 ) . Intestinal Transport Mechanism of ODSF Prior to establishment of the possible in vitro transcellular model and evaluation of the possible routes of ODSF trans - port , the differentiation and monolayer integrity of Caco - 2 cells on the Transwell ® membrane were measured using TEER ( > 350 Ω·cm 2 ) , as described above . To examine the mechanism involved in the transport of ODSF , 0 . 1 mL of HBSS containing inhibitors of specific cellular uptake path - ways and 0 . 6 mL of free HBSS were added in the apical and basolateral compartment of each well , respectively , as described in our previous report ( Table 1 ) . 39 After the Table 1 Inhibitors Used in the Transport Study Inhibitor Concentration Function Act D 3 . 2 μ M Inhibitor of ASBT - mediated transport CFZ 10 µM Inhibitor of OST α / β Chlorpromazine 32 μ M Inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis MBCD 10 mM Inhibitor of caveola / lipid raft - mediated endocytosis ( cholesterol depletion agent ) Genistein 0 . 1 mM Inhibitor of caveola / lipid raft - mediated endocytosis ( nonspecific inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinase ) Amiloride 0 . 1 mM Inhibitor of macropinocytosis Cys A 10 µM Inhibitor of P - gp - mediated efflux Brefeldin A 90 µM Inhibitor of the ER / Golgi pathway Abbreviations : Act D , actinomycin D ; ASBT , apical sodium - dependent bile acid transporter ; CFZ , clofazimine ; OST α / β , organic solute transporter alpha / beta ; MBCD , methyl - β - cyclodextrin ; Cys A , cyclosporine A ; P - gp , P - glycoprotein ; ER , endoplasmic reticulum . Dovepress Pangeni et al International Journal of Nanomedicine 2020 : 15 submit your manuscript | www . dovepress . com DovePress 7723 plate had been incubated at 37°C for 30 min , the solution in the apical compartment was replaced with 0 . 1 mL of ODSF diluted in HBSS ( equivalent to 100 µg / mL OP ) , along with corresponding inhibitors . The HBSS in the basolateral com - partment was replaced with 0 . 6 mL of fresh HBSS ; the plate was then incubated at 37°C . Aliquots of 200 µL of the sample solution were withdrawn from the basolateral com - partment at predetermined times ( ie , after 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 h ) and replaced with the same volume of fresh HBSS . 39 – 41 Moreover , P app of OP from apical to basolateral ( P app , AB ) and basolateral to apical ( P app , BA ) in the pre - sence of cyclosporine A ( Cys A ; specific inhibitor of P - gp ) and all inhibitors except Cys A were examined to deter - mine the role of P - gp - mediated efflux in the transport of ODSF . During apical to basolateral transport , 0 . 1 mL drug solution consisting of ODSF ( equivalent to 100 µg / mL OP ) was loaded into the apical compartment , along with Cys A ( 10 µM ) . Samples ( 100 µL ) from the basolateral compartment were withdrawn at predetermined time points ( ie , 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 h ) and replaced with fresh HBSS . In addition , for the efflux study ( basolateral to apical transport ) , 0 . 6 mL ODSF solution ( equivalent to 100 µg / mL OP ) containing Cys A or all inhibitors except Cys A was loaded into the basolateral compartment ; 0 . 1 mL aliquots were withdrawn from the apical compart - ment , followed by replacement with the same volume of fresh HBSS . The P app values in centimeters per second ( cm / s ) of apical to basolateral ( P app , AB ) and basolateral to apical ( P app , BA ) transport were calculated using the above equation . Furthermore , ethylene glycol - bis ( 2 - aminoethyl ether ) - N , N , N , ’N’ - tetraacetic acid ( EGTA ) , an extracellular cal - cium chelator , was used to reversibly open intracellular TJs in the Caco - 2 cell monolayer and evaluate the effects of TJ opening on the transport of ODSF . In addition , the effects of EGTA in combination with all inhibitors except Cys A on the transport of ODSF were examined using a Caco - 2 cell monolayer with TEER value > 350 Ω·cm 2 . Then , the monolayer in the apical compartment was trea - ted with 0 . 1 mL HBSS ( Ca 2 + - free medium ) containing 2 . 5 mM EGTA with or without all inhibitors except Cys A ; 0 . 6 mL HBSS ( Ca 2 + - free medium ) was added to the baso - lateral compartment , followed by 45 min preincubation at 37°C . The opening of monolayer TJs was confirmed by measurement of cell monolayer integrity with the TEER value of ≤70 Ω·cm 2 . The medium in the apical compart - ment was replaced with 0 . 1 mL HBSS ( with 1 . 8 mM Ca 2 + ) containing ODSF ( equivalent to 100 µg / mL OP ) , alone or with all inhibitors except Cys A ; 0 . 6 mL HBSS ( with 1 . 8 mM Ca 2 + ) was added to each well in the basolateral compartment , followed by incubation at 37°C for an addi - tional 5 h . Aliquots of 0 . 2 mL the solution from the basolateral compartment were withdrawn at predetermined time points , then replaced with the same volume of pre - warmed fresh HBSS . In addition , monolayer integrity at 2 and 5 h after drug loading was measured to identify the restoration of transmembrane resistance , which returned to ≥300 Ω·cm 2 . Before analyses , the collected samples were filtered through PVDF membrane filters ( 0 . 45 µm ) and the con - centration of OP that permeated across the Caco - 2 cell monolayer was determined by HPLC at 210 nm , as described above . Finally , the cumulative amount of OP that permeated through the Caco - 2 membrane was plotted as a function of time and P app was determined from the linear slope of the plot , using the above equation . In vitro Cytotoxicity Study To evaluate the cytotoxic effects of free OP , DLM , OP / DLM , DLM / P188 , ODSF without OP ( blank - ODSF ) , and ODSF on Caco - 2 and Madin – Darby Canine Kidney ( MDCK ) cells , cell counting ( CCK - 8 kit ; Dojindo Molecular Technologies , Rockville , MD , USA ) assays were performed . Caco - 2 or MDCK cells ( ATCC ® CCL - 34™ ) were seeded at a density of 5×10 3 cells / well in 100 µL of DMEM containing 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . After cells had been incu - bated at 37°C for 24 h , they were treated with 100 µL of OP , OP / DLM , and ODSF in free DMEM ( equivalent to 1 , 10 , 25 , 50 , 100 , 250 , and 500 µg / mL OP ) along with the same volume and respective concentrations of DLM , DLM / P188 , and blank - ODSF ; the cells were then incu - bated for an additional 12 h . To determine cell viability , 10 μL of 2 - ( 2 - methoxy - 4 - nitrophenyl ) - 3 - ( 4 - nitrophenyl ) - 5 - ( 2 , 4 - disulfophenyl ) - 2H - tetrazolium monosodium salt ( WST - 8 ) solution diluted in 100 µL of DMEM was added to each well and cells were incubated for 2 h . The absorbance was then measured using a microplate reader ( PerkinElmer multimode plate reader ; PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA , USA ) at 450 nm . The percentage of viable cells was calculated by comparing the numbers of treated and untreated cells . In vitro Drug Release of ODSF The in vitro release of OP from ODSF was measured in 900 mL amounts of 0 . 1 N HCl ( pH 1 . 2 ) or phosphate Pangeni et al Dovepress submit your manuscript | www . dovepress . com DovePress International Journal of Nanomedicine 2020 : 15 7724 buffer ( pH 6 . 8 ) using the United States Pharmacopeia ( USP ) dissolution test apparatus I ( LABINDIA DS 8000 basket , Maharashtra , India ) with shaking at 100 rpm at 37±0 . 2°C . Ten milligrams of OP or ODSF ( equivalent to 10 mg OP ) was placed into hard gelatin capsules ( size # 00 ) that were subjected to dissolution testing with sam - ples ( 0 . 5 mL ) withdrawn at regular intervals ( 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , and 120 min ) . The samples were filtered and OP or OP / DLM contents were measured via HPLC using a UV detector , as described above . Stability of ODSF To determine the stability of the lyophilized OP formula - tion , ODSF ( equivalent to 10 mg OP ) was packaged in a hard gelatin capsule ( size # 00 ) and stored in sealed high - density polyethylene ( HDPE ) bottles under different sto - rage conditions of temperature and RH ( 25±2°C with an RH of 65±5 % and 40±2°C with an RH of 75±5 % ) . At predetermined times ( after 0 , 1 , 3 , and 6 months ) , bottles were pulled from the stability chamber and the amount of drug in a capsule and cumulative drug release at 1 h in 900 mL of 0 . 1 N HCl ( pH 1 . 2 ) were measured using the USP dissolution test apparatus I and HPLC system , as described above . In addition , particle size , PDI , and zeta potential were measured to evaluate the physical stability of the ODSF micelles , as previously described . In vivo Pharmacokinetic Study of ODSF in Rats To examine the distinction of pharmacokinetic parameters of OP after IV injection and oral administration of OP or various concentrations of ODSF , Sprague – Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups of four animals each . Four groups were orally administered 400 µL OP - S ( 10 mg / kg OP dispersed in water ) , ODSF ( 2 . 5 ) ( equivalent to 2 . 5 mg / kg OP ) , ODSF ( 10 ) ( equivalent to 10 mg / kg OP ) , and ODSF ( 20 ) ( equivalent to 20 mg / kg OP ) . To evaluate oral bioavailability , rats in one group underwent IV administration of 150 µL an aqueous solution of OP ( 5 mg / kg ) via the tail vein . Blood samples ( 150 µL ) were withdrawn at specified time points from the retroorbital plexus with the rats under mild anesthesia ; then the blood samples were mixed with 50 µL sodium citrate ( 3 . 8 % solution ) . Finally , plasma was separated through immedi - ate centrifugation ( 2500×g , 15 min , 4°C ) and stored at – 70°C until analyses . The plasma concentration of OP based on Pt was measured using inductively coupled plasma - mass spectroscopy . Blank plasma was spiked with 200 µL different concentrations of Pt , such that the final concentrations were 1 , 10 , 25 , 50 , and 100 ng / mL ; this was followed by addition of iridium internal standard ( 200 µL , 100 ng / mL final concentration ) . The sam - ples were digested with 3 mL concentrated nitric acid for 6 h at 100°C . After complete digestion , the samples were allowed to cool to room temperature and then diluted to 10 mL with deionized water . The concentrations of Pt in each standard and sample were determined by ICP - MS ( SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH , Kleve , Germany ) , which was conducted using a double - focusing magnetic sector field mass spectrometer and a semiconductor direct charge detector . The measurement conditions for Pt were as follows : radiofre - quency power , 1450 W ; coolant flow , 12 L / min ; axillary flow , 2 . 3 L / min ; and nebulizer flow , 0 . 89 L / min . Absorption of Orally Administered ODSF in Monkeys To explore oral absorption of ODSF in nonhuman primates , nonnaïve male cynomolgus monkeys ( 3 . 3 – 3 . 7 kg ) were fasted for 16 h prior to drug administration and randomly divided into three groups of three animals each . Two groups received oral ODSF at 5 mL / kg ( equivalent to 10 mg / kg OP ) or OP ( 10 mg / kg ) dispersed in normal saline ( OP - S ) . Further three monkeys received 5 mL / kg OP ( 2 mg / kg ) in normal saline ( OP - IV ) via the saphenous vein to determine oral bioavailability . After oral or IV administration , blood samples ( 1 . 8 mL ) were collected from the femoral vein into BD Vacutainer ® citrate tubes ( Oakville , ON , Canada ) at 0 ( pre - dose ) , 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 , and 48 h after oral administration , and at 0 ( pre - dose ) , 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 , and 48 h after IV administration . Plasma samples were obtained by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 15 min and stored at – 70°C until use . Plasma OP levels were deter - mined based on Pt by ICP - MS using iridium as the internal standard , as described above . In vivo Antitumor Efficacy of ODSF The in vivo antitumor potential of orally administered ODSF was evaluated by inoculating CT26 ( ATCC ® CLR - 2638™ ; 1×10 6 cells / 100 µL phosphate - buffered saline , pH 7 . 4 ) or HCT116 ( ATCC ® CCL - 247™ ; 1×10 7 cells / 100 µL phos - phate - buffered saline , pH 7 . 4 ) cells into the right dorsal flank of 6 - week - old female BALB / c or BALB / c nude mice , respectively . When the tumor volume reached 70−100 mm 3 , Dovepress Pangeni et al International Journal of Nanomedicine 2020 : 15 submit your manuscript | www . dovepress . com DovePress 7725 the mice were randomly assigned to seven groups of 14 animals each : Control ( untreated ) , OP - IV ( 3 . 3 ) ( once - biweekly IV administration of 3 . 3 mg / kg OP ) , OP - IV ( 10 ) ( once - biweekly IV administration of 10 mg / kg OP ) , OP - S ( 10 ) ( once - daily oral administration of 10 mg / kg OP in aqueous solution ) , ODSF ( 2 . 5 ) ( once - daily oral administration of ODSF , equivalent to 2 . 5 mg / kg OP ) , ODSF ( 10 ) ( once - daily oral administration of ODSF , equivalent to 10 mg / kg OP ) , and ODSF ( 20 ) ( once - daily oral administration of ODSF , equivalent to 20 mg / kg OP ) . During the 21 - day treatment period , mice were fasted for 4 and 2 h before and after drug administration , respec - tively . Tumor volume and mouse body weight were mea - sured at 3 - day intervals ; tumor volume was calculated as width 2 ×length×0 . 52 , using a Vernier caliper for the mea - surements . After 3 weeks of treatment , mice were sacri - ficed ; tumor masses were measured and fixed in 10 % formalin for histological evaluation . For immunohisto - chemical analyses , paraffin - embedded tissues were cut into 5 - µm - thick sections for examination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) and CD31 expression pat - terns , as well as fluorescent terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase - mediated dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) analyses , in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol . In vivo proliferating cells were measured using immunos - taining and quantification of PCNA - positive cells . In addi - tion , the degrees of tumor angiogenesis and microvessel formation that indicated rapid tumor growth were evalu - ated by staining tumor sections with an antibody to the epithelial cell marker , CD31 , which reveals endothelial cells or their clusters by coloring them brown . Analyses of apoptotic cells in the tumor tissue were performed using TUNEL staining , which causes dark green fluorescence . Pharmacokinetic and Statistical Analyses Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using a noncompartmental method in WinNonlin ® software ( ver . 5 . 3 ; Pharsight Corporation , Mountain View , CA , USA ) . All data are expressed as means±standard devia - tions ( SDs ) or standard errors of the mean ( SEMs ) . Student’s t - test was used for comparisons between two mean values for unpaired data ; one - way analysis of var - iance ( ANOVA ) , followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test , was used for comparisons among three or more mean values for unpaired data . In all analyses , P < 0 . 05 was considered to indicate statistical significance . Results and Discussion Physical State Properties of ODSF Construction of an ion - pairing complex of OP with DLM and further preparation of an oral powder formulation of OP / DLM were performed to improve the lipophilicity and intestinal membrane permeability of OP ( Figure 1A ) . To confirm the ion - pairing complex formation between OP and DLM , the PXRD patterns of pure OP ; DLM ; P188 ; OP / DLM ; and a physical mixture of OP , DLM , and P188 were compared to the PXRD pattern of ODSF ( Figure 1B ) . Several characteristic peaks from PXRD of pure OP were observed at 2θ diffraction angles of 7 . 90° , 11 . 91° , 15 . 79° , 17 . 89° , 19 . 57° , 22 . 22° , 23 . 76° , 25 . 41° , 26 . 06° , 29 . 90° , 31 . 84° , 33 . 11° , and 41 . 14° ; these peaks indicated that OP was present in crystalline form . Some crystalline drug signals were also detectable , with reduced intensity , in the physical mixture ; these findings indicated that the drug remained present in crystalline form . The reduced intensities of peaks in the physical mixture may have been due to lower loading of the drug per unit weight of the physical mixture , compared to pure OP . These peaks were not observed in the PXRD pattern of OP / DLM , suggesting that OP was either molecularly dispersed with DLM or distributed in an amorphous form . Furthermore , ODSF did not exhibit any characteristic crystalline peaks from OP , suggesting that OP remained present in amor - phous form after powder formulation with DLM , Labrasol , and P188 . This suspicion was confirmed by DSC analyses ( Figure 1C ) . The thermal curves for pure OP and P188 indicated different melting temperatures , with narrow endothermic peaks at 278°C and 55 . 8°C , respectively , characteristic of the crystalline forms . DLM did not exhi - bit an endothermic peak up to 250°C and melted above that temperature , indicating that it was amorphous . The thermograms of OP / DLM and ODSF revealed no clear endothermic OP peaks , confirming that OP was molecu - larly dispersed with DLM in an amorphous form after complex formation with DLM and formulation with P188 and Labrasol . However , a wide range of OP endothermic peaks was observed for the physical mixture of OP , DLM , and P188 , suggesting that OP was molecu - larly dispersed into the molten states of DLM and P188 , Pangeni et al Dovepress submit your manuscript | www . dovepress . com DovePress International Journal of Nanomedicine 2020 : 15 7726 then partially converted into an amorphous state , presum - ably attributable to solid dispersion during heating . Based on the above results , PXRD revealed the loss of distinct diffraction peaks and occurrence of an amorphous form of the solid , combined with the loss of the regular arrangement observed in ODSF . In addition , the DSC method is considered a “rule of thumb” technique to assess the crystallization properties and miscibility between drug and polymer . Moreover , the amorphous solid powder con - sists of a chemically homogenous phase in which all com - ponents were uniformly mixed at the molecular level . 42 Several studies have suggested that the transformation of the crystalline form of drug to an amorphous form signifi - cantly increases its aqueous solubility , dissolution rate , and solid - state stability . 42 In addition , polymers used in the formulation could act as crystallization inhibitors and reduce the particle size , thereby achieving better wettability and preventing recrystallization . 43 Likewise , the use of the hydrophobic DC molecule in the ODSF formulation would increase the solubility , lipophilicity , and membrane perme - ability of OP without a trade - off between solubility and permeability . These changes are due to the amorphous form of the ODSF , which incorporates several solubilizing agents , resulting in supersaturation . 44 Furthermore , inclu - sion of bile acids in the formulation inhibits crystallization and stabilizes the formulation . 13 , 45 For these reasons , the amorphous form of ODSF and its reduced particle size , compared to OP / DLM , confirm the physical state of the formulation . Characterization of ODSF Micelles The excipients used in ODSF are P188 , DLM , and Labrasol , diluted in an aqueous solution ; their particles have sizes of 4 . 57±0 . 580 , 191±9 . 87 , and 21 . 0±0 . 32 nm , respectively , and PDIs of 0 . 293±0 . 063 , 0 . 766±0 . 122 , and 0 . 117±0 . 008 , respectively . The particle size and PDI of OP / DLM were 420±135 nm and 0 . 564±0 . 17 , respectively , whereas those of ODSF were 133±1 . 47 nm and 0 . 147 ±0 . 02 , respectively ( Figure 2A ) . The reduced particle size and PDI of ODSF , compared to OP / DLM , may have been due to the reduction in critical micellar concentration and the increase in micelle formation tendency caused by the combination of excipients . 46 In addition , incorporation of Labrasol and P188 with OP / DLM in the formulation Figure 1 ( A ) Schematic representation of ion - pairing complex formation between OP and DLM , and the self - assembled micellar structure of ODSF in the aqueous phase .

This increase in the zeta potential is related to the stability of ODSF micelles in aqueous conditions , which prevent the aggregation and flocculation caused by van der Waals attraction . 49 , 50 The results of several studies have sug - gested that bile salts form mixed micelles or aggregates in aqueous solution , presumably due to the hydrophobic attractive interaction of the apolar regions . 51 , 52 Furthermore , P188 and Labrasol , which are used as an Figure 2 ( A ) Particle size , ( B ) zeta potential distribution , and ( C ) a transmission electron micrograph of ODSF micelles .

In addition , transmission electron microscopy images of ODSF demonstrated the formation of spherical and homogenous nano - sized micelles , < 200 nm in diameter ( Figure 2C ) . In vitro Permeability of ODSF Through Parallel Artificial Intestinal Membrane and Caco - 2 Cell Monolayer To assess the passive diffusion of OP , OP / DLM , OP - SF , and ODSF through artificial intestinal membranes , perme - ability was determined using PAMPA . The P e of OP after ion - pairing complex formation with DLM was signifi - cantly increased by 12 . 4 - fold , compared to free OP ( Table 2 ) . This increase in artificial membrane permeabil - ity may have been due to the DLM - induced enhancement of OP hydrophobicity , which subsequently increased pas - sive absorption through the phospholipid layer . 26 Notably , bile acids act as crystallization inhibitors and potentially play roles in the formulation of supersaturated dosage forms or lipid - based drug delivery systems . 45 Moreover , incorporation of OP / DLM into the oral powder formula - tion significantly increased the P e of OP by 24 . 0 - fold , 3 . 76 - fold , and 1 . 94 - fold , compared to free OP , OP - SF , and OP / DLM , respectively . The increased amphiphilicity and permeability of OP in this study may have been due to the synergistic activity of DLM , Labrasol , and P188 used in ODSF . The in vitro permeabilities of free OP , OP / DLM , OP - SF , and ODSF across a Caco - 2 cell monolayer exhibited trends similar to those across the artificial intestinal mem - brane ( Table 2 ) . Addition of P188 and Labrasol to OP exhibited 98 . 1 % higher P app compared to free OP ; this may have been due to the synergistic emulsifying activity of P188 and Labrasol , which resulted in formation of stable micelles on gentle agitation . The P app of OP after ion - pairing complex formation with DLM was 386 % and 145 % higher , compared to free OP and OP - SF , respec - tively ; this may have been due to the specific interaction of OP / DLM with apical sodium - dependent bile acid transporter ( ASBT ) . 55 Binding of bile acids to the cal - cium channels may have enhanced membrane flexibility and increased partitioning into the membrane , thereby causing transient opening of TJs and increasing the para - cellular absorption of OP . 30 In addition , the viscosity and elasticity of mucus adhering to the epithelial surface are reduced by bile acids , thereby enhancing intestinal mem - brane permeability . 29 , 56 Intestinal membrane permeability is also reversibly modified by DC via autophosphoryla - tion of epidermal growth factor receptor , as well as by dephosphorylation and rearrangement of occludin at the TJ level . 57 The P app of ODSF was further enhanced by 1010 % , 460 % , and 128 % , compared to free OP , OP - SF , and OP / DLM , respectively . This significant enhancement in P app of ODSF may have been due to the synergistic role of DLM , Labrasol , and P188 in the formation of stable micelles of OP / DLM , which might enhance drug transport through endocytosis and micropinocytosis . 58 Moreover , Labrasol changes membrane permeability along with inhibition of the secretory systems in the intestinal membrane , thereby enhancing drug absorption . 59 Surfactants ( eg , Labrasol and P188 ) also act as absorption enhancers by reversibly opening TJs , causing redistribution of zonula occludens - 1 ( ZO - 1 ) ; this enhances the absorption of hydrophilic drugs . Furthermore , administration of a formulation with posi - tive charge binds to the epithelial cell membrane by electrostatic interaction , which could cause disruption of TJs . 60 Therefore , the synergistic activity of DLM , Labrasol , and P188 may have contributed to the signifi - cant enhancement in P app of ODSF . However , further studies using higher concentrations of these excipients alone or in combination are needed to confirm reversible changes in intestinal membrane properties .

Dovepress Pangeni et al International Journal of Nanomedicine 2020 : 15 submit your manuscript | www . dovepress . com DovePress 7729 Intestinal Transport Mechanism of ODSF To study the mechanisms involved in the permeation , trafficking , and delivery of ODSF into the systemic circu - lation through enterocytes , different transport pathways were individually inhibited using specific pharmacological inhibitors ( Table 1 ) . As described above , the ion - pairing complex of OP with DLM enhanced the lipophilicity of OP , which may have increased both the paracellular and transcellular transport of the drug through the Caco - 2 cell monolayer . In addition , ODSF in aqueous phase can exist as free OP / DLM or in micellar form , together with P188 and Labrasol . These self - assembled micelles of ODSF could also facilitate the uptake of OP through clathrin and caveola - mediated endocytosis , and macropinocytosis , respectively . Therefore , to confirm the presence and eluci - date the predominant uptake mechanisms of these various pathways that may participate in the transport of ODSF , the Caco - 2 monolayer was treated with specific inhibitors and their roles in the transport of OP were investigated . Notably , bile acids are mostly reclaimed through a combination of various processes , such as passive diffu - sion in the proximal intestine , active transport in the distal ileum , and passive absorption in the colon . Furthermore , bile acids are actively transported from the distal ileum via ASBT and shuttled across the basolateral membrane , thus entering the portal circulation by organic solute transporter alpha and beta ( OST α / β ) . 61 To confirm involvement of ASBT in ODSF transport , actinomycin D ( Act D ) and clofazimine ( CFZ ) were used as inhibitors of ASBT and OST α / β , respectively , alone or in combination . 62 , 63 In the presence of Act D alone , the P app of ODSF was reduced by 58 . 4 % , compared to the control ( without inhibitors ) ( Figure 3A ) . This significant reduction in P app of ODSF after suppression of ASBT suggested that bile acid trans - porter plays an important role in increasing the permeabil - ity of ODSF . In addition , ODSF may be present as free OP / DLM or in micellar form ; these micelles containing bile acids could form reverse micelles in aqueous solution , thereby exposing OP / DLM to the ASBT and enabling enhanced absorption through ASBT . 64 , 65 OST α / β primarily facilitates the transport of absorbed bile acids across the basolateral membrane of ileal enterocytes . 66 Furthermore , the presence of an inhibitor of OST α / β ( CFZ ) reduced the P app of ODSF by 55 . 7 % , compared to the control ( without inhibitors ) ( Figure 3A ) . This result reaffirmed the active involvement of ASBT in the transport of ODSF across ileal enterocytes . When both CFZ and Act D were used in combination , the P app of ODSF was reduced by 58 . 5 % , compared to the control ( without inhibitors ) ; this finding was similar to the observations with Act D alone and CFZ alone ( Figure 3A ) . These results confirmed the simulta - neous involvement of ASBT - mediated transport , as well as the shuttling mechanism of OST α / β across the basolateral membrane , during the absorption of ODSF . In addition to ASBT - mediated transport , ODSF micelles can utilize endocytosis pathways to enter the cell . Furthermore , to understand the major endocytosis pathway and preferred trafficking routes involved in the transport of ODSF , specific endocytosis mechanisms were examined ( ie , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , caveola - mediated endocytosis , and macropinocytosis ) and their effects on P app of ODSF were compared to the control condition ( without inhibitors ) . First , to determine the role of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , the specific inhibitor chlorpromazine was used ; this resulted in an only 12 . 8 % reduction in the P app of ODSF , compared to the control ( without inhibitors ) ( Figure 3A ) . This result indicates that clathrin - mediated endocytosis does not play a substantial role in the uptake of ODSF micelles . Subsequently , to evaluate the role of the caveola - mediated pathway in the transport of ODSF , genistein was used as a specific inhi - bitor . Genistein is an important inhibitor of protein tyro - sine kinase , which is involved in catalysis of tyrosine phosphorylation , activation of multiple signals for various transduction pathways , and regulation of endocytosis . In addition , genistein reportedly interrupts depolymerization of actin and recruitment of dynamin II , which is an impor - tant mechanism for the internalization and scission of caveola vesicles during caveola - mediated uptake from enterocytes . 67 , 68 After treatment of Caco - 2 cell mono - layers with genistein , a 47 . 4 % reduction was observed in P app of ODSF , compared to the control ( without inhibi - tors ) ; this finding indicates an important role for caveola - mediated endocytosis in the uptake of ODSF ( Figure 3A ) . By contrast , another inhibitor of caveola - mediated endo - cytosis , methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( MBCD ) , slightly reduced the P app of ODSF by 14 . 6 % , compared to the control ( without inhibitors ) ( Figure 3A ) ; this result may have been due to its mode of action ( ie , sequestration of cho - lesterol ) , which led to its depletion in the plasma mem - brane of enterocytes and caused inhibition of caveola - mediated endocytosis . 69 The reduction of MBCD inhibi - tory activity in the presence of ODSF may be explained by the presence of a cholesterol derivative ( DC ) in DLM ; this may neutralize the effects of MBCD . 40 Importantly , Pangeni et al Dovepress submit your manuscript | www . dovepress . com DovePress International Journal of Nanomedicine 2020 : 15 7730 macropinocytosis is another major pathway that may be involved in the internalization of ODSF . Initially in this process , the intestinal membrane forms a sac - like structure due to ruffling of the plasma membrane after contact with nanoparticles ; this structure engulfs solutes or solvents present in the extracellular milieu of enterocytes to form cargo - loaded macropinosomes . 70 To investigate the role - played by macropinocytosis in ODSF trafficking , we added the macropinocytosis inhibitor amiloride ; this reduced the P app of ODSF by 31 . 5 % compared to the control ( no inhibitor ) ( Figure 3A ) . Thus , macropinocytosis was involved in the absorption of ODSF micelles . After internalization across the enterocyte membrane through endocytosis , ODSF is subjected to various pivotal stages of intracellular trafficking , which further determine its final destination . During this process , ODSF that entered through endocytosis or macropinocytosis can be internalized via formation of early or late endosomes , Figure 3 ( A ) Effects of various intestinal transport inhibitors on the relative apparent permeability of ODSF across a Caco - 2 cell monolayer . * * * P < 0 . 001 compared to the P app of ODSF in the absence of all inhibitors ( untreated control ) .

Therefore , to confirm exocytosis and involvement of the ER - to - Golgi apparatus pathway in the intracellular trafficking of ODSF micelles , the effects of brefeldin A , a specific inhibitor of the ER / Golgi secretory pathway , were examined . 74 The results indicated a significant reduction in P app of ODSF ( 51 . 1 % ) , compared to the control ( without inhibitors ) , after treatment of the cells with brefeldin A ; this suggested active involvement of the ER / Golgi pathway in the exo - cytosis of ODSF ( Figure 3A ) . In addition , involvement of the ER / Golgi apparatus in the intracellular transport of ODSF micelles clarified the roles of both endocytosis and macropinocytosis , and suggested substantial lysoso - mal escape of ODSF micelles .

P - gp is reportedly mainly responsible for the generation of multidrug resistance to anticancer drugs by pumping them out of the cells through P - gp - mediated efflux . 75 Therefore , to examine the role of P - gp in the transport of ODSF , the P app of ODSF across the Caco - 2 monolayer was examined bidirectionally : from apical to basolateral ( A to B , absorptive function ) ( P app , AB ) and basolateral to apical ( B to A , secretive function ) ( P app , BA ) , in the pre - sence of Cys A or all inhibitors other than Cys A ; this was compared to the control ( without inhibitors ) . The P app , BA of ODSF across the Caco - 2 monolayer ( without inhibitors ) was significantly enhanced by 74 % , compared to P app , AB ( without inhibitors ) , which suggested the involvement of P - gp - mediated efflux in the transport of ODSF . In addi - tion , inhibition of P - gp - mediated efflux by Cys A , as well as by a combination of inhibitors except Cys A , resulted in a 41 % elevation and 45 % reduction in P app , AB , compared to control ( without inhibitors ) , respectively ( Figure 3B ) . Therefore , a distinctive feature of P - gp substrates is that they exhibit higher transport in the secretory direction ( B to A ) , compared to the opposite direction ( A to B ) . 76 These results clearly demonstrated the involvement of P - gp - mediated efflux in the transport of ODSF . Our results were consistent with this notion ; in the presence of Cys A , a significant enhancement in the P app of ODSF was observed during A to B transport , whereas a marked reduction was observed in the opposite direction . Despite the presence of active P - gp - mediated efflux , the elevations in PAMPA and Caco - 2 permeability ( as described above ) of ODSF , compared to free OP , suggested significant compensatory effects of other transport mechanisms ( eg , ASBT - mediated facilitated transport , macropinocytosis , endocytosis , transcellular passive diffusion , and paracellu - lar routes ) . This significantly enhanced permeation may have also been due to the surfactant - induced inhibition of transport proteins . 59 , 77 Thus , intestinal transport of ODSF can be further improved by introduction of excipients with P - gp suppressant activity , such as D - α - tocopherol poly - ethylene glycol succinate . In addition to the abovementioned routes , transcellular passive diffusion and paracellular transport could also be major routes involved in enhancement of the permeability and bioavailability of orally administered drugs . To clarify the involvement of these routes in the transport of ODSF , the effects of EGTA on the uptake of ODSF were examined . EGTA is a selective calcium chelator , which is used to bind free extracellular Ca 2 + ions and can reversibly open the intercellular TJs of Caco - 2 monolayers . 78 As shown in Figure 3C , when the Caco - 2 monolayer was treated with all inhibitors other than Cys A , the P app of ODSF decreased by 65 . 2 % , compared to the control ( without inhibitors ) ; this finding indicates that passive diffusion and paracellular transport could have been responsible for 34 . 8 % of ODSF permeation across the Caco - 2 monolayer ( Figure 3C ) . Moreover , this result was correlated with that of PAMPA as described above , whereby the passive diffusion of OP through the artificial intestinal membrane was markedly improved after ion - pairing complex formation with DLM , followed by adding P188 and Labrasol . Notably , the P app of the EGTA - treated Caco - 2 monolayer ( with all inhibitors other than Cys A ) was similar to that of the control ( without inhibitors and EGTA ) ; however , it was elevated by 47 . 0 % , compared to the EGTA - untreated Caco - 2 monolayer ( with all inhibitors except Cys A ) ( Figure 3C ) . This observation clearly indicated the enhancement of P app of ODSF after reversible opening of TJs using EGTA . In addition , this result indicates that reversible opening of TJs could increase the intestinal transport of ODSF ; incorporation of this com - ponent with TJ - opening properties might favor intestinal permeation of OP . The modulation of P188 and Labrasol in ODSF micelles , which have proven TJ - opening proper - ties , demonstrated the possibility of paracellular transport that may have favored the permeation of ODSF . 79 , 80 Pangeni et al Dovepress submit your manuscript | www . dovepress . com DovePress International Journal of Nanomedicine 2020 : 15 7732 In vitro Cytotoxicity of ODSF on Caco - 2 and MDCK Cells Cell viability assays were performed to evaluate the cyto - toxic effects of a wide range of concentrations of free OP , DLM , OP / DLM , DLM / P188 , blank - ODSF , and ODSF on Caco - 2 and MDCK cells . As shown in Figure 4 , DLM , a combination of DLM and P188 , and blank - ODSF ( without OP ) had no cytotoxic effects on Caco - 2 or MDCK cells ; the cell viability was greater than 90 % for a concentration range equivalent to 1−500 µg / mL of OP . Based on these results , neither DLM nor blank - ODSF showed toxicity at the experi - mental concentrations and duration , suggesting good toler - ance and biocompatibility . In addition , a previous study demonstrated no cytotoxic activity for deoxycholic acid on Caco - 2 cells . 27 However , OP , OP / DLM , and ODSF demon - strated cytotoxicity at concentrations higher than 100 µg / mL . The cell viabilities of Caco - 2 cells incubated with OP , OP / DLM , and ODSF at concentrations of 250 and 500 µg / mL were 82 . 5±1 . 11 % and 66 . 6±6 . 99 % , 59 . 5±5 . 39 % and 47 . 6±6 . 65 % , and 38 . 6±3 . 06 % and 34 . 1±5 . 13 % , respectively ( Figure 4A ) . Similarly , MDCK cells treated with 250 µg / mL of OP , OP / DLM , and ODSF demonstrated reductions in cell viabilities to 74 . 8±6 . 82 % , 67 . 8±6 . 25 % , and 55 . 3±7 . 39 % , respectively , compared to the control ( Figure 4B ) . Increasing the concentration of OP , OP / DLM , and ODSF to 500 µg / mL significantly reduced the percentage cell viabilities to 55 . 3±7 . 79 % , 47 . 5±6 . 79 % , and 39 . 3±4 . 10 % , respectively . The increased cell cytotoxicity of OP / DLM and ODSF in Caco - 2 and MDCK cells at higher concentra - tions ( 250 and 500 µg / mL ) might be attributable to increased cellular uptake , compared to pure OP . These results demon - strated the biocompatibility of the excipients used in the formulation ; OP , OP / DLM , and ODSF had no cytotoxic effects on Caco - 2 or MDCK cells at experimental concen - trations . However , further comparative toxicity studies involving experimental animals are required for the indivi - dual excipients , blank formulation ( without OP ) , and ODSF . In vitro Dissolution of ODSF The cumulative percentage release profiles of OP and ODSF in simulated gastric ( pH 1 . 2 ) and intestinal ( pH 6 . 8 ) media are shown in Figure 5 . At pH 1 . 2 , the drug release profiles of free OP and ODSF increased steadily over time and exceeded 90 % at 60 min . The release of OP from ODSF was similar to that of free OP ( > 90 % at 120 min ) in the medium at pH 6 . 8 . In addition , the similarity factors ( f2 ) between OP and ODSF in pH 1 . 2 and 6 . 8 media were 50 and 76 , respectively , indicating that the two dissolution profiles were similar . These similar release profiles suggested that ionic complex formation with DLM and incorporation into powder did not significantly affect the drug dissolution rate .

Evaluation of ODSF stability was performed at two different temperatures and RHs for 6 months ( Table 3 ) . The percen - tage drug contents at 25±2°C with 65±5 % RH and at 40±2°C with 75±5 % RH ranged from 97 . 2±2 . 21 % to 101±2 . 02 % over 6 months , suggesting that there was no change in the drug content in the capsules during storage . In addition , more than 90 % drug release was observed at 1 h ( in 0 . 1 N HCl , pH 1 . 2 ) under both sets of storage conditions . This result demon - strates that the storage of ODSF for 6 months does not affect the drug release rate . Moreover , after redispersion of the lyophilized formulation in water , the ODSF micelles main - tained their former particle size , PDI , and zeta potential during 6 months of storage under both sets of conditions ; these findings suggested that the overall storage stability of the formulation was good . In vivo Oral Absorption of ODSF in Rats The comparative mean plasma concentration - time profiles after a single IV dose of OP ( OP - IV , 5 mg / kg OP ) , oral administration of OP in aqueous solution ( OP - S , 10 mg / kg ) , or various doses of ODSF ( equivalent to 2 . 5 , 10 , and 20 mg / kg OP ) are illustrated in Figure 6 ; the pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in Table 4 . The plasma concen - tration of OP increased rapidly after oral administration of OP - S ( 10 mg / kg ) or the various doses of ODSF ; it reached its maximum at 0 . 5 h after drug intake , indicating rapid absorption . After a single oral dose of ODSF ( equivalent to 2 . 5 mg / kg OP ) , a significant increase was observed in the oral bioavailability of OP to 24 . 0±0 . 642 % , which was 3 . 70 - fold higher than the oral bioavailability of OP - S ( 10 mg / kg ) . In addition , the maximum plasma concentration ( C max ) and area under the plasma concentration – time curve ( AUC ) after oral administration of ODSF ( equivalent to 10 mg / kg OP ) were 0 . 136±0 . 016 μg / mL and 1 . 62±0 . 125 μg·h / mL , respec - tively ; these values were 1 . 92 - and 1 . 68 - fold higher , respec - tively , than those of OP - S ( 10 mg / kg ) , demonstrating 68 . 2 % greater oral bioavailability . This increase in oral bioavail - ability may have been due to the increased solubility and lipophilicity of OP after incorporation into the nanoformula - tion . In addition , our findings regarding the intestinal mem - brane transport mechanism demonstrated significant reductions of P app after inhibition of ASBT and OST α / β - mediated transport by Act D and CFZ , respectively ; these findings indicate an active role of the bile acid transporter , followed by OST α / β - mediated transport , in increasing the oral bioavailability of OP via elevated uptake of OP / DLM . The DC in DLM may also enhance intestinal membrane flexibility via phosphorylation of the epidermal growth fac - tor receptor and rearrangement of occludin at the TJ level . 57 , 80 Transport of ODSF micelles via the caveola / lipid raft - mediated endocytosis pathway may explain their increased oral absorption , which was confirmed by the Figure 5 In vitro cumulative percentage release of OP and ODSF at ( A ) pH 1 . 2 and ( B ) pH 6 . 8 .

Notably , the presence of non - ionic surfactants ( eg , Labrasol and P188 ) in the formulation can reversibly modify intestinal membrane fluidity by dephosphorylation and rearrangement of occludin . 79 , 81 Thus , the increased oral absorption of OP is supported by the entry of ODSF into enterocytes through macropinosome formation , paracellular transport , and passive transcellular diffusion ( verified by intestinal transport mechanistic analyses ) . However , an increase in the ODSF dose from 10 to 20 mg / kg OP reduced the oral bioavailability from 10 . 9 ±0 . 838 % to 8 . 47±1 . 55 % . Furthermore , a single oral dose of ODSF ( equivalent to 10 mg / kg OP ) was associated with 2 . 78 - and 1 . 81 - fold increases in C max and AUC , respectively , compared to ODSF ( equivalent to 2 . 5 mg / kg OP ) . Similarly , a 2 - fold increase in the oral dose of ODSF ( to 20 mg / kg OP ) yielded C max and AUC values of 0 . 224±0 . 055 μg / mL and 2 . 52±0 . 460 μg·h / mL , respectively , which were 1 . 65 - and 1 . 56 - fold higher , respectively , than the corresponding values of ODSF ( equivalent to 10 mg / kg OP ) . Therefore , the C max and AUC of ODSF increased in a dose - dependent manner between doses of 2 . 5 mg / kg OP and 20 mg / kg OP .

Pharmacokinetics of Oral ODSF in Monkeys Given the enhanced oral absorption of ODSF in rats , we examined the mean plasma concentration – time profiles of orally administered OP ( 10 mg / kg ) or ODSF ( equivalent to 10 mg / kg OP ) , and IV - administered OP ( 2 mg / kg ) , in cyno - molgus monkeys ( Figure 7 ) ; the mean pharmacokinetic parameters are listed in Table 5 . After IV administration of OP ( 2 mg / kg ) , the plasma levels of Pt decreased with time with an elimination T 1 / 2 of 45 . 9±5 . 46 h . After oral adminis - tration of OP - S ( 10 mg / kg ) , OP was absorbed with a C max and T max of 0 . 043±0 . 006 µg / mL and 2 . 00±0 . 00 h , respectively . Oral ODSF significantly enhanced the intest - inal absorption of OP with observed C max and AUC last values of 0 . 192±0 . 038 µg / mL and 3 . 97±0 . 659 μg·h / mL , respectively , thus 4 . 47 - and 3 . 78 - fold greater than those of OP - S , respectively .

Pangeni et al Dovepress submit your manuscript | www . dovepress . com DovePress International Journal of Nanomedicine 2020 : 15 7736 the fact that nanoformulation enhanced drug solubility and lipophilicity , as discussed above . The mean residence time ( MRT ) of ODSF was 18 . 4±0 . 049 h , slightly less than those of OP - S ( 19 . 7±0 . 124 h ) and OP - IV ( 19 . 6±0 . 254 h ) . Therefore , ODSF was rapidly absorbed in both rats and monkeys . In vivo Tumor Growth Inhibition of Orally Administered ODSF in a Murine Colon Cancer Cell Model Next , the tumor growth inhibitory efficacy of orally admi - nistered ODSF was investigated in a murine colon cancer model ( CT26 cells ) . As shown in Figure 8A , tumor growth in the control group occurred continuously and rapidly , reaching a mean of 3261±1651 mm 3 by day 21 . However , after once - daily oral administration of OP - S ( 10 ) and ODSF ( 2 . 5 ) , respective tumor growth retardation rates of 34 . 8 % and 32 . 4 % were observed , compared to the control group ; these similar rates may have been due to pharmacokinetic similarities . Administration of OP - IV ( 3 . 3 ) to tumor - bearing mice resulted in 40 . 0 % inhibition of tumor growth rate , compared to the control group . Increasing the dose to OP - IV ( 10 ) resulted in significant enhancements of tumor suppression by 70 . 2 % and 53 . 3 % , compared to mice in the control and OP - S ( 10 ) groups , respectively . After oral administration for 21 days , ODSF ( 10 ) and ODSF ( 20 ) also significantly suppressed the tumor volume , by 76 . 9 % and 87 . 1 % , respectively , compared to the control group , and by 25 . 0 % and 58 . 2 % compared to OP - IV ( 10 ) , respectively . Although the oral bioavailability of ODSF ( 10 ) in rats was 10 . 9 % , its anticancer efficacy was higher than the efficacy of the maximum tolerated dose of OP - IV ( 10 ) . This peculiar behavior may have been due to the oral metronomic sche - duling of ODSF , which can activate innate and adaptive immune responses , reduce immune suppressive populations of regulatory T cells , and activate innate immune cells ( eg , natural killer cells , dendritic cells , and macrophages ) . 24 , 86 , 87 Metronomic chemotherapy is the protracted and regular administration of relatively low and minimally toxic doses of chemotherapy , with no drug - free breaks . 88 Thus , a daily low dose of ODSF was implemented to maintain a low but sustained concentration of OP in the tumor cells and micro - environment , to minimize adverse drug reactions induced by the maximum tolerated dose , to target both endothelial and tumor cells at the proliferation stage , and to prolong therapeutic responses ( rather than causing only short - term tumor regression ) . Moreover , metronomic chemotherapy prevents regrowth of resting tumor cells , thereby minimiz - ing the possibility of chemoresistance . 89 , 90 However , the mechanism of the anti - angiogenic property of ODSF requires further study . Although tumor growth in the ODSF ( 20 ) group was maximally inhibited , compared to the OP - IV ( 10 ) and control groups , the antitumor efficacy of that treatment was similar to treatment with ODSF ( 10 ) ; this finding corresponds well with the pharmacokinetics indicat - ing the dose dependency of C max and AUC . Indeed , the maintenance of low , prolonged , and pharmacologically active plasma concentrations of OP during metronomic therapy with ODSF ( 10 ) may have direct and indirect effects on tumor cells and their microenvironment by inhi - biting tumor angiogenesis through induction of apoptosis within activated endothelial cells and inhibition of endothe - lial cell migration . 1 , 91 – 93 Moreover , recent studies have suggested an immunomodulatory effect of OP through T cell - mediated antitumor immunity and enhanced presen - tation of damage - associated molecular patterns in color - ectal tumor cell lines , along with inherent cytotoxicity in tumor cells . 22 , 94 Notably , tumor growth in mice treated with ODSF ( 10 ) and ODSF ( 20 ) began to decrease on day 15 , whereas all other treatment groups and the control group exhibited continual increases in tumor volume . After 21 days of administration , the isolated tumor masses in mice treated with ODSF ( 20 ) were significantly reduced , by 76 . 9 % , compared to the masses in the controls . Moreover , oral and IV administration of ODSF ( 10 ) and OP - IV ( 10 ) resulted in reductions in tumor mass of 50 . 1 % and 71 . 7 % , respectively , compared to the controls ( Figure 8B and C ) . Treatment of mice with ODSF ( 20 ) resulted in body weight reduction at 6 days , compared to the control group and other treatment groups ; this may have been due to drug - induced toxicity ( Figure 8D ) . However , the reduced body weight was maintained until day 21 . Thus , based on the dose of OP , further toxicity studies should be performed after repeated oral administration of ODSF for intervals longer than 3 weeks . To investigate the biological effects of oral administration of ODSF , isolated tumors were subjected to immunohisto - chemical analyses for cell proliferation , apoptosis , and vessel density . Analyses of CD31 expression revealed the highest density of CD31 - positive microvessels in the control group ; however , the OP - IV ( 3 . 3 ) and OP - S ( 10 ) groups also exhib - ited greater numbers of microvessels , compared to other treatment groups ( Figure 8E ) .

Dovepress Pangeni et al International Journal of Nanomedicine 2020 : 15 submit your manuscript | www . dovepress . com DovePress 7739 compared to the controls . The numbers of PCNA - positive cells , an indicator of the rate of proliferation , were signifi - cantly higher in the control and OP - S treatment groups than in the OP - IV ( 10 ) , ODSF ( 10 ) , and ODSF ( 20 ) groups ( Figure 8E ) . Moreover , the ODSF ( 10 ) , ODSF ( 20 ) , and OP - IV ( 10 ) treatment groups exhibited significant increases in the number of TUNEL - positive cells , indicating increased apoptosis after treatment , compared to the controls ( Figure 8E ) . Thus , induction of apoptosis and inhibition of prolifera - tion may be due to the anti - angiogenic mechanism of action of metronomic chemotherapy with OP , which upregulates the expression of endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors ( eg , thrombospondin - 1 ) . 95 In vivo Analyses of the Inhibitory Effects of Orally Administered ODSF on Tumor Growth in a Human Colon Cancer Cell Model The antitumor efficacy of orally administered ODSF on human colon cancer cells ( HCT116 ) was also assessed ; find - ings regarding tumor growth inhibition were similar to those observed in the murine model . Treatment of tumor - bearing mice with OP - IV ( 3 . 3 ) resulted in a 33 . 5 % reduction in tumor volume , compared to controls . Moreover , ODSF ( 10 ) resulted in 2 . 64 - and 1 . 90 - fold reductions in tumor volume , compared to the control and OP - IV ( 10 ) groups , respectively ( Figure 9A ) . After oral administration of ODSF ( 20 ) for 21 days , the tumor growth rates and weights were significantly reduced with maximum suppression of 75 . 4 % and 78 . 1 % , respectively , compared to the control . Moreover , treatment of tumor - bearing mice with the same dose of OP resulted in significant reductions of the isolated tumor weights in the oral ODSF ( 10 ) group by 49 . 5 % and 34 . 6 % , respectively , compared to the OP - S ( 10 ) and OP - IV ( 10 ) groups ( Figure 9B and C ) . None of the treatment groups or controls , except ODSF ( 20 ) , revealed an effect on body weight of tumor - bearing mice . However , body weight was maintained after day 15 in the ODSF ( 20 ) group ( Figure 9D ) . Thus , once - daily oral administration of ODSF ( 10 ) was well tolerated with maintenance of microenviron - mental OP level sufficient to suppress tumor growth . Similarly , after staining of histological sections of HCT116 tumor tissues with anti - CD31 antibody and anti - PCNA antibody , mice treated with OP - IV ( 10 ) , ODSF ( 10 ) , and ODSF ( 20 ) exhibited marked reductions in the numbers of CD31 - positive microvessels and PCNA - positive prolifer - ating cells , compared to the control and OP - S ( 10 ) groups ( Figure 9E ) . Furthermore , TUNEL assay evaluation revealed significantly greater numbers of TUNEL - positive apoptotic cells in the OP - IV ( 10 ) , ODSF ( 10 ) , and ODSF ( 20 ) groups , compared to the control and OP - S ( 10 ) groups ( Figure 9E ) . Therefore , considering the results of tumor efficacy and toxicity based on the administration dose , ODSF ( 10 ) was selected as the optimum formulation . Taken together , the findings presented here revealed that formation of an ion - pairing complex of OP with DLM and further incorporation into a solid formulation enhanced the oral absorption and bioavailability of OP . In addition , daily oral administration of ODSF as metronomic chemotherapy may maintain a sufficient OP level in both tumor cells and their microenvironment , resulting in sig - nificant inhibition of tumor growth in both human and mouse tumor models . Therefore , delivery of ODSF as an oral metronomic chemotherapy may be a preferred alter - native for use in patients with colorectal cancer . Conclusion We designed a solid oral formulation of OP by ion - pairing complex formation with DLM at a molar ratio of 1 : 2 , along with P188 and Labrasol as dispersants ( ODSF ) . The effective and apparent permeability of OP from ODSF was significantly improved by 24 . 0 - and 11 . 1 - fold , respectively , compared to free OP . Analyses of the intestinal transport mechanism indi - cated that inhibition of ASBT in the Caco - 2 cell monolayer resulted in a significant reduction in its P app , suggesting that ASBT - facilitated uptake represents the predominant pathway underlying enhanced oral absorption of OP from ODSF . In addition , caveola / lipid - raft mediated endocytosis , macropino - cytosis , passive diffusion , and paracellular transport were actively involved in the transport of ODSF . The oral bioavail - abilities of ODSF ( equivalent to 10 mg / kg OP ) in rats and monkeys were enhanced 1 . 68 - and 3 . 77 - fold compared to those of free OP . Moreover , enhanced oral absorption of the optimum formulation and maintenance of sustained plasma drug concentration during metronomic therapy with ODSF ( 10 ) resulted in maximal reductions in tumor volume by 25 . 0 % and 34 . 6 % , respectively , compared to the maximum tolerated dose of OP - IV ( 10 ) in CT26 and HCT116 tumor - bearing models . These observations suggest therapeutic poten - tial for oral metronomic delivery of ODSF as a preferred alternative for the treatment of colorectal cancer .
