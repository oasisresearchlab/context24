The protozoan Plasmodium falciparum causes lethal malaria 1 . Adhesion of erythrocytes infected with P . falciparum to vascular endothelium and to uninfected red blood cells ( rosetting ) may be involved in the pathogenesis of severe malaria 2 – 4 . The binding is mediated by the antigenically variant erythrocyte - membrane - protein - 1 ( PfEMP - 1 ) 5 – 8 , which is encoded by members of the P . falciparum var gene family 9 , 10 . The control of expression and switching of var genes seems to lack resemblance to mechanisms operating in variant gene families of other microbial pathogens 11 , 12 . Here we show that multiple , distinct var gene transcripts ( about 24 or more ) can be detected by reverse tran - scription and polymerase chain reaction in bulk cultures of the rosetting parasite FCR3S1 . 2 , despite the adhesive homogeneity of the cultures . We also detected several var transcripts in single erythrocytes infected with a ring - stage parasite of FCR3S1 . 2 , and found that different var genes are transcribed simultaneously from several chromosomes in the same cell . In contrast , we detected only one var transcript , FCR3S1 . 2 var - 1 , which encodes the rosetting PfEMP - 1 protein 13 , in individual rosette - adhesive trophozoite - infected cells , and we found onlyone PfEMP - 1 type at the erythrocyte surface by labelling with 125 iodine and immuno - precipitation . We conclude that a single P . falciparum parasite simultaneously transcribes multiple var genes but , through a developmentally regulated process , selects only one PfEMP - 1 to reach the surface of the host cell . We studied the transcription and expression of var genes in a recently cloned and phenotypically homogeneous parasite culture , FCR3S1 . 2 , which has a rosetting rate of greater than 90 % . We ﬁrst used reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) to amplify the var gene messenger RNAs from unsynchronized cultures at the eighteenth generation after cloning , when most of the parasites were at the ring stage . We used degenerate primers that mapped to conserved stretches of the Duffy - binding - like ( DBL ) - 1 domain of PfEMP - 1 ( ref . 14 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . We cloned products of ampliﬁcation by RT - PCR , and sequenced 15 of these recombinant plasmids containing inserts of 500 – 600 base pairs ( bp ) . As the parasites were phenotypically homogeneous , we assumed that there would be a corresponding sequence homogeneity in the transcript population . Analysis of the inserts showed , however , that only (cid:44) 30 % of the sequences ( 5 of 15 ) corresponded to the FCR3S1 . 2 CIDR DBL - 1 DBL - 1 . 1 DBL - 1 . 2 ATS TM INTRON DBL - n Figure 1 General structure of var / PfEMP - 1 .

Downstreamof the DBL - 1 domain there is a cysteine - rich interdomain region ( CIDR ) and a variable number ( n ¼ 0 – 4 ) of less conserved DBL structures . A putative trans - membrane domain ( TM ) is followed by the highly conserved acidic terminal sequence ( ATS ) , which is presumably cytoplasmically located . We designed the degenerate oligonucleotide primers DBL - 1 . 1 and DBL - 1 . 2 from short , conserved amino - acid sequences ﬂanking relatively variable stretches ( 400 – 700bp ) in the DBL - 1 domain 14 .

Ten out of 15 recombinants , of which 8 were unique , contained var sequences that were distinct from FCR3S1 . 2 var - 1 ( Fig . 2 ) . All of the ampliﬁed products encoded DBL - 1 domains . In another set of RT - PCR ampliﬁcations of total RNA , a similar pattern of transcript diversity was observed in the rosetting - negative FCR3S / a , a related but phenotypically distinct parasite ( data not shown ) . Thus we found a high degree of sequence diversity of active var genes ( and presumably , therefore , functional variation ) in these bulk cultures . Were the multiple transcripts a consequence of the extensive antigenic switching of the var genes , or do individual parasites express several PfEMP - 1 mRNAs ? To answer this question we ampliﬁed the PfEMP - 1 mRNAs from individual ring - infected cells , trophozoite - infected cells , and uninfected erythrocytes from the same FCR3S1 . 2 culture by using single - cell micromanipulation cloning and subsequent RT - PCR . The conditions for the RT - PCR with the DBL - 1 primers were optimized for use with a minimal amount of template 13 . The results show that more than one ampliﬁed product was present in at least seven out of fourteen ring - stage parasites , as seen by gel analysis ( Fig . 3a ) . The most frequent RT - PCR product was a band of (cid:44) 430 bp . This ampliﬁca - tion product ( see below ) was also detected in the bulk culture when using the optimized RT - PCR conditions . In addition to the 430 - bp band , a 300 - bp product was seen in sixof the fourteen cells ; a 550 - bp ampliﬁcation product was found in ﬁve cases and a 750 - bp band was detected in one of the P . falciparum - infected red blood cells . Importantly , RT - PCR ampliﬁcation products were not observed in reactions from which reverse transcriptase was omitted , nor was intron DNA ampliﬁed when using primers spanning the intron / exon splice junction of FCR3S1 . 2 var - 1 ( Fig . 3b , c ) . We cut out of the gel PCR products from several cells ( 430 - and 550 - bp bands ; Fig . 3a ) . We then reampliﬁed , cloned and sequenced these products . The 550 - bp bands showed sequence heterogeneity . Sequencing of four individual 550 - bp clones from cell 3 showed a new variant of the DBL - 1 domain ( var - 9 ) and three sequences identical to FCR3S1 . 2 var - 1 ( Fig . 3d ) . We found two additional DBL - 1 variants ( var - 10 and var - 11 ) when we sequenced two 550 - bp clones from cell 7 . All of these DBL - 1 variants identiﬁed in individual cells , except var - 11 , were found in the FCR3S1 . 2 bulk culture . As in the bulk culture , FCR3S1 . 2 var - 1 DBL - 1 was the most common transcript sequence in single parasites . The data show that several var genesaretranscribed in individual P . falciparum parasites early during intra - erythrocytic development . In contrast to the sequence diversity found in the 550 - bp bands , sequencing of the 430 - bp RT - PCR products from ﬁve ring - infected red blood cells ( cells 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 and 9 ) showed that this band contained only one var sequence ( of 434 bp ) that was identical to the sequenceof the original FCR3S1 . 2 var - 1 gene of this parasite . We have shown that the RT - PCR products from rosetting , trophozoite - infected red blood cells containing FCR3S1 . 2 , always consist of the same 434 - bp band containing only the var - 1 sequence 13 . We have conﬁrmed this ﬁnding independently ( not shown ) and it concurs with the detection of a single v ar transcript in mature parasites of a homogeneous phenotype 15 . The results indicate that early expres - sion of multiple var genes is curtailed to a monogeneic expression of PfEMP - 1 as the parasite progresses from the ring to the trophozoite stage , between 8 and 16 hours after invasion . Although the mechan - ism of selection remains obscure , the fact that var - 1 is the most frequentlyexpressed transcript in individual parasites , despite being in a minority in the total var message population at the ring stage , suggests that the selection process occurs post - transcriptionally . Other layers of control , for example at the transcriptional level , may also be in operation .

The ethidium - bromide - stained gel is shown on the left . Molecular sizes are given in megabases . Nature © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 1998 8 letters to nature 394 NATURE | VOL 394 | 23 JULY 1998 we hybridized transcript sequencesfrom cell 3 ( var - 1 and var - 9 ) and cell 7 ( var - 1 , var - 10 and var - 11 ) to PFGE ( pulsed ﬁeld gel electro - phoresis ) - separated chromosomes of four clonally related but phenotypically distinct FCR3S parasites ( rosetting - positive : FCR3S1 , FCR3S1 . 2 ; rosetting - negative : FCR3S1 . 6 , FCR3S / a ) and of 3D7A , an unrelated rosetting - negative parasite ( Fig . 4 ) . The var - 1 probe hybridized to chromosome 4 , which was of similar size in each of the FCR3S parasites regardless of the rosetting phenotype . The var - 9 sequence from cell 3 hybridized to a chromosome in the compression region and to an additional chromosome of the FCR3S1 . 6 clone . The other two var sequences cloned from cell 7 ( var - 10 and var - 11 ) hybridized to chromosomes distinct from chromosome 4 . None of these probes hybridized to the chromo - somes of the parasite 3D7A , indicating that this parasite has a completely different var gene repertoire . Our data show that active transcription of multiple var genes occurs on different chromo - somes at an early stage after invasion of erythrocytes . As only one var transcript was seen in trophozoite - infected red blood cells , we determined whether only one PfEMP - 1 type is expressed at the erythrocyte surface . We analysed surface - radiola - belled , infected erythrocytes by SDS / polyacrylamide gel electro - phoresis and autoradiography . Only one labelled polypeptide ( relative molecular mass (cid:44) 285 , 000 ; M r 285K ) with the character - istics of PfEMP - 1 was detected on the surface of red blood cells infected with the FCR3S1 . 2 clone ( Fig . 5 ) , a result consistently found in more than ten independent labelling experiments . To conﬁrm that the polypeptide was PfEMP - 1 , we performed immu - noprecipitations with six monospeciﬁc antisera directed either against the semivariable DBL - 1 domain of our previously cloned FCR3S1 . 2 var - 1 , or against the highly conserved acidic terminal sequence of PfEMP - 1 , which has been found in all var genes described so far 9 , 10 , 13 , 15 , 16 . We also used three human sera from clinically immune adults from a malaria holoendemic area in Liberia . In all cases , a single polypeptide of M r (cid:44) 285K was immu - noprecipitated from the labelled FCR3S1 . 2 - infected red blood cells , whereas no other PfEMP - 1 precipitated with either of the sera . Thus , although several var genes are transcribed in the course of the parasite’s intra - erythrocytic development , only one PfEMP - 1 type seems to be transported to the host cell surface . The ability of P . falciparum to undergo clonal antigenic variation is well established 7 , 17 but , to survive in the human host , P . falciparum must maintain a delicate balance between functional conservation ( that is , of adhesive phenotypes ) and antigenic variation . ‘Switch - ing’ variants with changed adhesive and antigenic phenotypes , as well as with different PfEMP - 1 types , have been generated from the clonal tree of parasites studied here 18 . Our RT - PCR data indicate that the switching process is initiated by the activation of several var genes at different chromosomal loci early in development , and that it is from this set of activated genes that a new var variant is selected as the parasite differentiates into the trophozoite stage . A calcula - tion of the number of var transcript species present in the bulk culture of FCR3S1 . 2 indicates that at least 24 different var genes are expressed , out of a total of 45 or more genes estimated to constitute the var gene pool of this parasite ( see Methods ) . The data are not as conclusive for the individual ring - stage cells but are still consistent with the simultaneous activation of many var genes . One interpretation of these ﬁndings 11 , is that many , if not all , functional var genes are activated in the beginning of the intra - erythrocytic cycle and that any cell has the potential to switch to any var gene in the repertoire . However , activation of a set of genes distributed throughout all chromosomes 14 , 19 could be a costly and inefﬁcient process , resulting in overﬂow transcription . This possi - bility is suggested by the detection of transcripts of the CSP gene , a mosquito - stage - speciﬁc antigen , in FCR3S1 . 2 rings ( data not shown ) and the transient activation of the sporozoite - speciﬁc antigen , STARP , in ring - stage parasites 20 . Alternatively , large regions of the genome could undergo a process of loose transcription early during intra - erythrocytic development , resulting in a short - lived activation of many , perhaps all , parasite genes . The presence of only the FCR3S1 . 2 var - 1 transcript in the later , trophozoite , forms shows that there is a preference to switch back to the previously expressed var gene ( Fig . 6 ) . This bias towards reusing the former PfEMP - 1 probably reﬂects the mechanism of switching and may have a biological role in maintaining an adhesive phenotype , presumably functional in the previous life cycle , as well as in controlling the rate at which new epitopes are exposed to the host . Our results are consistent with the characteristics of clinical immunity to malaria : protection against severe disease is achieved only after a relatively large number of exposures 21 , 22 .

Methods Parasites and isolation of total RNA . The P . falciparum parasites were cultured according to standard methods with 10 % AB + Rh + serum added to the buffered medium ( RPMI supplemented with HEPES , gentamycin and sodium bicarbonate ) . We obtained the clone FCR3S1 . 2 by micromanipulation from FCR3S1 , aparasitepreviouslyclonedbylimitingdilution 23 . Therosettingrateof FCR3S1 . 2 was routinely 90 – 95 % when used for experiments . FCR3S / a ( (cid:44) 5 % rosetting ) wasderived fromFCR3Sbyenrichmentof non - rosetting parasites as described 18 . Total RNA from FCR3S1 . 2 and FCR3S / a parasites was puriﬁed according to standard procedures from non - syncrhonized cultures containing predominantly ring - stage parasites . Collection of single parasites and RT - PCR . We collected individual infected or uninfected erythrocytes from cultures by micromanipulation using 5 - (cid:109) m micropipettes and an inverted light microscope . We carefully examined each collected cell , by repeated grabbing , ejecting and turning , to assess single - infection and maturity stage , or absence of the parasite . Rosette - forming P . falciparum - infected red blood cells ( pRBCs ) were stripped of uninfected cells . Immediately after collection , the cells were frozen on dry ice and subsequently heat - lysed , DNase - treated and ampliﬁed by RT - PCR using primers DBL - 1 . 1 andDBL - 1 . 2 , asdescribed 13 . Severalcontrolswereincludedineachexperiment , including a blank control ( without cells ) , a red - blood - cell control ( uninfected erythrocytes ) , and a control without reverse transcriptase , to rule out the possibility of contamination and ampliﬁcation due to the presence of genomic DNA . EitherinRT - PCRexperimentsorduringdirectampliﬁcationofgenomic DNA , DBL - 1 . 1 and DBL - 1 . 2 primers exclusively ampliﬁed var DBL - 1 frag - ments , as determinedbyBLASTanalysisof the sequencesagainst the Genebank database . Ampliﬁcation reactions were analysed in 1 % agarose gels . Ampliﬁcation of the intron / exon junction region of the var 1 gene . As an additional control for eventual genomic DNA ampliﬁcation , we ampliﬁed a 315 - bp fragment of FCR3S1 . 2 var - 1 complementary DNA , spanning the intron / exon junction of this gene , using the upstream primer P - 1 ( 5 (cid:57) - CTTTCGACTCTACCATCCT - 3 (cid:57) , locatedin exonI ) , the downstreamprimerL - 5 . 1 ( 5 (cid:57) - CCAATTCTTCATATTCACTTT - 3 (cid:57) , located in exon II ) , and optimized RT - PCR conditions as described 13 . Southern blot . Chromosomes of different parasites were separated by PFGE and transferred to nylon ﬁlters using standard procedures . A 140 - bp fragment speciﬁc for the FCR3S1 . 2 var - 1 was ampliﬁed with primers L - 2 ( 5 (cid:57) - TTACATCTCCGTCGCCAG - 3 (cid:57) ) and L - 3 ( 5 (cid:57) - TCGAGCAAGGAGCTTGATA - 3 (cid:57) ) . Hybridizationwith 32 P - labelledprobes ( 140bp and 550bp ) was performed with standard methods and washed under stringent conditions ( 0 . 1 · SSC , 60 (cid:56) C ) . The ﬁlters were analysed by phosphorimagery . Surface labelling of pRBCs and immunoprecipitation . Cultures were radiolabelled with 125 I by the lactoperoxidase method as described 18 . Tropho - zoite - infected pRBCs were separated by centrifugation in Percoll / Sorbitol gradients and sequentially extracted in 1 % TX - 100 and 2 % SDS . The SDS extract was immunoprecipitated with human , rabbit or rat sera as described 24 and monitored by SDS – PAGE and phosphorimagery . Calculation of the number of var mRNA species and var genes in the population . We used the formula P ¼ ð 1 (cid:50) 1 = m Þ n to estimate the number of unique var gene mRNA variants in bulk culture . The probability of ﬁnding a uniquesequenceisrepresentedby P ( inthiscase P ¼ 8 = 15 ¼ 0 : 53 ) ; thenumber of sampled sequences is represented by n ( here n ¼ 15 ) ; and m represents the number of unique var mRNA variants in the population . We assumed that all sequences are expressed at an equal level , that the primers amplify all var sequences , and that there is no bias in the PCR under the conditions used . As theseassumptionsareprobablynottrue ( forexample , var - 1 transcriptsseemto beoverrepresented ) , therealnumberofexpressed var genevariantsis probably higher than the estimated value . We also used the formula described above to obtain a lower limit estimate of the var gene pool size of the FCR3S1 . 2 parasite ( with P ¼ 14 = 24 ¼ 0 : 58 and n ¼ 24 ) . We sequenced 24 recombinant clones from genomic FCR3S1 . 2 DNA ampliﬁed with DBL - 1 . 1 and DBL - 1 . 2 primers . All ampliﬁed fragments were var DBL - 1 and 14 sequences were unique .
