Objective We compare 5 health informatics research projects that applied community - based participatory research ( CBPR ) approaches with the goal of extending existing CBPR principles to address issues specific to health informatics research . Materials and methods We conducted a cross - case analysis of 5 diverse case studies with 1 common element : integration of CBPR approaches into health informatics research . After reviewing publications and other case - related materials , all coauthors engaged in collaborative discussions focused on CBPR . Researchers mapped each case to an existing CBPR framework , examined each case individually for success factors and bar - riers , and identified common patterns across cases . Results Benefits of applying CBPR approaches to health informatics research across the cases included the following : developing more relevant re - search with wider impact , greater engagement with diverse populations , improved internal validity , more rapid translation of research into ac - tion , and the development of people . Challenges of applying CBPR to health informatics research included requirements to develop strong , sustain - able academic - community partnerships and mismatches related to cultural and temporal factors . Several technology - related challenges , including needs to define ownership of technology outputs and to build technical capacity with community partners , also emerged from our analysis . Finally , we created several principles that extended an existing CBPR framework to specifically address health informatics research requirements . Conclusions Our cross - case analysis yielded valuable insights regarding CBPR implementation in health informatics research and identified valu - able lessons useful for future CBPR - based research . The benefits of applying CBPR approaches can be significant , particularly in engaging popula - tions that are typically underserved by health care and in designing patient - facing technology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Keywords : community - based participatory research , research design , patient empowerment , mHealth , patient - centered care BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Health information technology , including mobile health technology , holds significant potential for engaging individuals in managing their health by providing tools to track , manage , and interpret personal health metrics . 1 – 6 These tools can empower patients to ask questions , communicate concerns , identify and assess alternatives , reflect on progress , and alter their health behavior . Despite the plethora of avail - able technologies , the number of engaged and empowered patients using these technologies is still relatively modest . 7 – 10 Patient - facing technologies are adopted less frequently and used in a less - integrated fashion than intended by designers and implementers . 8 , 11 – 13 The reach of consumer health informatics technologies among under - served groups , including racial / ethnic minorities and low - income individuals , is especially problematic . 14 – 19 Community - based participatory research ( CBPR ) is an approach that may improve both patient engagement in health care and representation of underserved groups in informatics research and practice . 20 CBPR , which originated in the public health field , is a collaborative , action - oriented research approach that involves develop - ment of long - term , equitable research partnerships between academic researchers , community - based organizations ( CBOs ) , and community members . 21 , 22 Community members are actively engaged at all stages of a research project , from problem definition to translation of results into action , with an effort to pursue equity in project authority , credit / authorship , and resources . 23 – 25 The most commonly applied frame - work for implementing CBPR was defined by Israel and colleagues ( box 1 ) . 26 CBPR shares several concepts in common with other sociotechni - cal approaches to technology design and implementation , such as user - centered design ( UCD ) 27 , 28 and participatory design ( PD ) . 29 All 3 approaches ( CBPR , UCD , PD ) share a common goal of incorporating the perspectives and needs of intended end users into technology design and can apply similar methodologies . Key differences between CBPR , UCD , and PD relate to their theoretical foundations and to the degree of CBO and community member engagement across project stages ( figure 1 ) . In UCD projects , researchers typically lead the entire effort from study design to dissemination . 28 In PD projects , researchers typically control study design and results dissemination , although end users collaborate in study implementation . 29 In contrast , CBPR is an all - encompassing research paradigm that defines purposeful engage - ment among researchers , intended end users , and other stakeholders throughout all stages of a research project . 21 This broader degree of engagement through CBPR fundamentally alters how technologies are designed , implemented , and translated into wider practice . The CBPR approach has seen some diffusion into health informat - ics research , particularly in research seeking to engage with diverse Correspondence to Kim M Unertl , 2525 West End Avenue , Suite 1475 , Nashville , TN 37203 , USA ; kim . unertl @ vanderbilt . edu V C The Authors 2015 .

J Am Med Inform Assoc 2016 ; 23 : 60 – 73 . doi : 10 . 1093 / jamia / ocv094 , Research and Applications D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / j a m i a / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 23 / 1 / 60 / 2379975 b y gue s t on 02 M a y 2019 communities . 23 , 30 Informatics researchers have applied CBPR in 4 major research areas to date : ( 1 ) exploring technology practices in a specific community 24 , 31 – 33 ; ( 2 ) developing context - sensitive technol - ogy interventions 30 , 34 – 39 ; ( 3 ) using technology to understand commu - nity problems 40 , 41 ; and ( 4 ) studying the CBPR approach itself as applied to informatics . 42 – 45 There has been limited guidance , how - ever , on appropriate approaches to apply CBPR principles specifically to informatics and on understanding lessons learned from past CBPR projects . 35 , 40 , 46 To address this gap , we present a comparative case study of 5 health informatics research projects that applied CBPR approaches , with the goal of extending existing CBPR frameworks to address issues specific to health informatics research . METHODS Our research draws on experiences applying CBPR to 5 case studies ( box 2 ) . The case studies are geographically diverse , have a wide vari - ety of academic and community partners , and involve different researchers . Contextual factors and research methods varied across the studies , but all of the studies shared a common starting point : integration of CBPR approaches into a health informatics research project . Over a series of meetings and electronic communications from October 2014 through February 2015 , we collaboratively analyzed the implementation of CBPR principles and processes across the 5 cases . 47 – 49 Our cross - case analysis 47 sought to elicit common experi - ences across the projects and to develop extended principles for effec - tive application of CBPR in this domain . Four of the authors ( KMU , KAS , SB , TCV ) presented a preliminary discussion of these common CBPR experiences in a panel at the Workshop on Interactive Systems in Healthcare Symposium in November 2014 . After the symposium , we expanded the analysis group with 3 additional researchers ( CLS , TRC , CS ) , including a community member who was an active collaborator on 1 of the case studies ( TRC ) . The group of authors included researchers with significant expertise in the collection and analysis of qualitative data . Because the 5 cases varied significantly in study procedures and metrics and quantitative comparisons were not feasible , the group of authors approached the collection and analysis of data for this manu - script as we would approach a qualitative research study . In initial group meetings , the full group of coauthors collectively identified important data elements needed to understand how each study imple - mented CBPR . These data elements were grouped into 1 table focused on study design and implementation logistics ( table 1 ) and a second table focused on viewing the study through the lens of Israel’s CBPR Principles 26 ( table 2 ) . These 2 tables served as data collection instru - ments for the cross - case comparison and provided a standardized ba - sis for qualitative comparisons . A researcher involved with a specific case ( TRC for Project HOPE—HIV / STD Outreach , Prevention & Education ; TCV for Positive Youth ; CLS for HealthBridge ; SB for WICER—Washington Heights / Inwood Informatics Infrastructure for Comparative Effectiveness Research ; KMU for Middle Tennessee Sickle Cell ) filled in content for table 1 and for table 2 to describe how the research project imple - mented CBPR while mapping the case to Israel’s CBPR Principles . The same researcher also contributed information regarding success factors and challenges / barriers encountered by the individual case , Box 1 : Key principles of community - based participatory research ( adapted from Israel and colleagues 26 ) Principle 1 : Viewing community as a unit of identity . The community has 1 or more unifying aspects such as a geographic area ( ie , neighborhood ) , chronic disease identity , or professional role . Principle 2 : Understanding the existing strengths and resources within the community . The community brings resources to the table , and these resources should be valued for their unique contribution to the research process . Examples of resources could include long - term experience in working in a specific neighborhood , facilities in the community , and ongoing outreach networks and initiatives . Principle 3 : Building collaborative partnerships in all research phases . The community is not just included during data collection , but rather is included from problem definition through results dissemination . Examples could include the following : community members can help to define research questions that are important to them , can be included as members of the research team , and can contrib - ute to research design and data analysis if they want to . Principle 4 : Integrating research results for mutual benefit . The research team builds new knowledge and incorporates the knowledge into action through iterative cycles . For example , a needs assessment study can provide direction for initial community interventions , but as needs are addressed through research , new or different needs could emerge . Principle 5 : Viewing research and partnership building as a cyclical and iterative process . Collaboration between researchers and the community is not a “one off” activity . Activities related to building and maintaining academic - community partnerships and refinement of research goals occur iteratively . For example , if new community needs emerge or existing needs change , the direction or emphasis of the research may evolve . Principle 6 : Empowering both academic and community partners through co - learning opportunities , with awareness of social inequal - ities . While researchers learn about community needs and community members’ expertise , community members are given the opportu - nity to learn about research processes and methodologies . Examples could include providing training to community members about data collection and data analysis or partnering with community members when presenting research results . Principle 7 : Incorporating positive and ecological perspectives into research . Research designs should incorporate perspectives focused on well - being and determinants of health . Examples could include leveraging community resources in the conduct of research and examining contextual behaviors that influence health - related behaviors . Principle 8 : Disseminating knowledge to all partners . Data and results should be provided to community partners , and community partners should provide input on results dissemination . Research results should not be distributed solely via peer - reviewed academic journals . Examples could include having community members / partners as coauthors on academic manuscripts and identifying alternate dissemination venues such as community meetings .

Materials that the data collection drew on included publications and abstracts related to individual cases , 31 , 32 , 35 , 53 – 60 , 62 – 68 nonacademic communication media employed by some of the projects ( eg , websites , social media accounts ) , 50 – 52 , 61 and discussion focused on both published and unpublished study information with researchers who were principal investigators or key study personnel for each case . The approach to data collection assisted the group with gathering information about study mechanics beyond material typically included in publica - tions of study results , enabling the group to have a deeper under - standing of both the what and the how of CBPR research in health informatics . All coauthors then reviewed and discussed all contributed informa - tion and examined the data for patterns across cases . During group dis - cussions held over voice / video conference and via email , the group of authors probed deeply on all content to understand the meaning behind the information and the perspective of the researcher who contributed the data . Meeting notes were recorded by 1 coauthor ( KMU ) and pro - vided to the full group of authors . The robust group discussion process sought to ensure contributed data were an accurate representation of study information , and it allowed coauthors to suggest and challenge individual interpretations of contributed data . During the discussion pro - cess , all coauthors worked collaboratively to identify common themes and patterns across cases as well as differences among the cases . Using the experiences of each case individually and all cases collectively , all coauthors collaboratively worked to examine gaps between com - monly applied CBPR principles and the specific issues raised in CBPR projects in health informatics . After discussion of the common pat - terns of cases , 1 author ( TCV ) drafted the implementation checklist , which was later reviewed and discussed by all of the manuscript au - thors . In the final step of the analysis process , 1 researcher ( KMU ) stan - dardized the language across cases for purposes of manuscript readability , a process that was then discussed , refined , and approved by all coauthors . Study procedures for each of the 5 cases individually followed the appropriate ethical oversight process ( eg , Institutional Review Board , community organization research approval ) required by the location and context where the research took place . The methods followed by the cross - case comparison itself did not involve human subjects , and thus were exempt from Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval . Figure 1 : Comparison of sociotechnical approaches to technology design . ( A ) Iteration occurs during the course of research projects using all 3 approaches . However , CBPR is the only approach of the 3 that in - cludes iterative work across multiple projects , including continued partnership building and maintenance activities . ( B ) The Community Members group in CBPR projects includes intended end users for technology products , but not all individuals in the Community Members group may be intended end users .

Additional specific details regarding each case study , including research goals , theoretical frameworks , funding models , and other study details are shown in table 1 . Results from 4 of the 5 case stud - ies were previously published . Details of study methods and outcomes are provided in articles referenced by specific cases in table 1 . RESULTS Despite the diversity of the 5 case studies and underlying research designs , the cross - case comparison identified common lessons and factors . Common elements related to benefits of applying CBPR , chal - lenges encountered in the course of a project , and additional CBPR principles specific to health informatics research . Mapping cases to CBPR principles The degree that each case translated individual CBPR principles defined by Israel 26 into research practice varied ( table 2 ) . Each case clearly identified the community with which they were working , although the unit of group identity was often a multilayered construct comprising several elements ( eg , geographic area , age group , race / ethnicity , chronic disease , shared behaviors ) . Each case built on exist - ing strengths within the community and relied on existing community resources , including relationships , physical space , knowledge about living with a specific chronic disease , and technical skills . In some cases , community partners were involved from identification of research questions through results dissemination while in other cases community partner involvement was more limited . Research results were used both for academic purposes ( eg , publications , grant submissions ) and to benefit the community directly through technol - ogy - based interventions , delivery of research results back to the com - munity in context - appropriate modes , and events / activities designed to benefit the community . Across all cases , the research and collabo - ration activities took an iterative approach composed of cycles , with output from initial phases providing guidance and input to later research phases . The concepts of “co - learning” and “empowerment” held different meanings for each case . Learning opportunities for community mem - bers included the following : ( 1 ) learning about research processes ( eg , training a community member to be a research assistant , hiring com - munity - based health workers ) ; ( 2 ) learning about health issues ( eg , education about the impact of behavioral components on health , learn - ing about the community ) ; and ( 3 ) learning about technology . Learning opportunities for researchers also took a number of different forms . For example , in the Sickle Cell Disease case , a researcher with limited prior CBPR experience ( KMU ) learned about meaningful approaches to engaging communities and patients through working with an estab - lished academic - community partnership . CBPR - based research also provided opportunities for researchers in the 5 cases to learn about community practices and priorities , develop empathy for the life Box 2 : Summaries of the 5 case studies The HIV / STD Outreach , Prevention & Education ( HOPE ) Project ( Flint and Saginaw , Michigan ) . The HOPE intervention focused on psy - chosocial factors related to communication with sex partners and other healthy sex behaviors to prevent sexually transmitted infections . The project was a quasi - experimental intervention study in which over 500 African American young adults ( aged 18 – 24 years ) in both Genesee and Saginaw counties in Michigan received a face - to - face intervention , HOPE Parties . Participants in Genesee County also re - ceived a social media intervention ( HOPE Online ) integrated into the intervention . Researchers sought to compare whether participants who received the HOPE Party and HOPE Online experienced a greater intervention effect or sustained this effect longer . Positive Youth Project ( Ontario , Canada ) . The Positive Youth Project took place in 2 phases . Phase 1 involved a needs assessment through qualitative interviews with 34 HIV - positive youth and young adults aged 12 – 24 years . HIV - positive youth were trained as researchers and played an active role in data analysis . Results were disseminated through scholarly and community - based venues . Phase 2 involved the creation of a youth - friendly website on HIV / AIDS treatment , including 3 serious games and an evaluation with youth via qualitative interviews . Project Health Bridge ( Denver , Colorado ) . Health Bridge is an on - going project exploring technology use to promote healthy lifestyles in a racially diverse , low socioeconomic status community . Over a 5 - year time frame , researchers built a relationship and engaged in collaborative research with the Bridge Project , a community program to support people living in public housing projects . The team con - ducted research to understand community needs , which informed the iterative development of a mobile application to promote healthy snacking . The team then evaluated the application with 20 community members in a comparative field trial . A series of community din - ners were held to share results with participants and other community members . Washington Heights and Inwood Informatics Infrastructure for Comparative Effectiveness Research , New York , New York ( WICER ) . The overall goals of the WICER project were to understand and improve the health of the Washington Heights Inwood community and to establish an informatics infrastructure for comparative effectiveness research . CBPR principles were used to develop and implement a sur - vey of almost 6000 primarily Latino community members . Subsequently , the team designed a set of infographics for the self - reported health behaviors and outcomes , as well as physical measurements . The infographics were refined through participatory design sessions ( 2 in English , 18 in Spanish ) as a prerequisite for returning data to study participants of varying levels of health literacy . The tailored info - graphics along with comparators were produced using the Electronic Tailored Infographics for Community Engagement , Education , and Empowerment ( EnTICE 3 ) system for distribution via a variety of formats as a data - driven community engagement strategy . Middle Tennessee Sickle Cell Project ( Nashville , Tennessee ) . The Vanderbilt - Meharry - Matthew Walker Center of Excellence in Sickle Cell Disease project is an ongoing collaborative effort between academic medical centers , community health centers , and community or - ganizations to implement a medical home model for children and adults with sickle cell disease . Initial project phases did not include health informatics components ; a CBPR - oriented health informatics needs assessment was later added to the project when informatics resources became available . Planned activities specific to the health informatics project included participatory design workshops with stakeholder groups . Research related to this project is ongoing .

Co - learning opportunities influenced the trajectories and perspectives of both community members and researchers in the 5 included cases . Social inequalities between researchers and community members were addressed through strategies such as research participation compensation , culturally sensitive data collection , and exploring the behaviors and beliefs of researchers and stakeholders . Positive per - spectives on health were incorporated by collecting data regarding a wide range of health behaviors , as opposed to focusing exclusively on illness . Strategies for incorporating ecological perspectives were implemented through approaches such as focusing on the families rather than the individuals , focusing on trust as a cultural factor incor - porated into design , and collecting data on social determinants of health . Dissemination of knowledge to all partners required develop - ment of strategies and dissemination routes beyond standard peer - reviewed literature and academic conferences . In each case , research teams sought to translate research results to participants and to the broader community . Projects included components such as a Community Health Board and presentations to CBOs to assist with dis - semination . Alternate community - appropriate dissemination venues were used in several cases , such as a youth - friendly arts - based pho - tocopied publication ( zine ) , infographics of research findings designed with community input , websites , and social media accounts . Benefits of applying CBPR to health informatics research A clear theme in the cross - case analysis was that CBPR assists research projects to accrue benefits that would not have emerged through researcher - driven paradigms ( table 3 ) . We identified 7 catego - ries of benefits : more relevant research , wider impact , better fit between interventions and target beneficiaries , more effective recruit - ment and retention of diverse populations , improved internal validity , more rapid translation of research into action , and development of people . Examples of each of these categories are provided in table 3 , with some of the examples discussed in more detail in the following text . Use of CBPR approaches resulted in more relevant research as projects sought to incorporate research questions of interest to the community rather than investigating areas mainly of interest to researchers . In some cases , this led to an expansion of the research focus and in others , a complete change of focus . For example , in the Bridge Project , needs and priorities of community members shifted the project’s focus from personal health records to technology to sup - port healthy eating . A community focus , in turn , contributed to the research described in our cases , having a wider impact because of greater community interest in the research topics beyond individuals actively participating in the studies . For example , knowledge gained through research proj - ect participation led participants in Health Bridge studies to promote healthier eating behaviors among their families , friends , and cow - orkers . In addition , because the Health Bridge informatics project was able to provide funding for a portion of a dietitian’s salary , the commu - nity organization was able to recruit and hire a qualified dietitian , ex - tending the impact of the informatics project to a wider community scale . The relevance of research topics also contributed to a better fit between interventions and target beneficiaries , as study participants helped to define potential interventions that were more meaningful in their lives , which often diverged from researcher perspectives on topics . Unsurprisingly , community member involvement in defining and designing the research assisted with more effective recruitment and retention of diverse populations through use of context - aware recruit - ment strategies and linkage with CBOs who had closer relationships with research participants . Approaches such as snowball sampling , where research participants helped identify others who might be interested in research participation , proved especially valuable as a recruitment strategy for some cases . Active community member engagement in research design also led to improved internal validity , related to instrumentation and data collection design and data analy - sis . In some cases , the CBPR approach led to more rapid translation of research into action , with study results being directly integrated into changes in community outreach efforts and into knowledge shared with health care providers rather than only into standard academic research channels . Beyond all of the direct benefits of applying CBPR to specific research studies , several of the cases yielded benefits related to the development of people , both within academic settings and in the com - munity . Community members who assumed leadership roles in com - munity aspects of research projects learned new skills and grew as leaders within their own social networks . Other community members , including 2 paper authors ( TCV , TRC ) , chose to pursue further educa - tional opportunities after their work with a CBPR research project or obtained jobs with CBOs . Human capital development through CBPR is also particularly indicative of the bidirectional benefits of a CBPR approach . Challenges of applying CBPR to health informatics research We identified common challenges that emerged across the 5 cases ( table 4 ) . Applying CBPR in practice required strong academic - community partnerships , and developing these relationships required time , energy , trust , and resources on all sides . Building rapport and trust between researchers , community members , and CBOs demanded skills and knowledge that are not commonly taught or developed in academic research settings . In particular , past negative community experiences in interacting with researchers led to difficulty in building trust . Mismatches between academic and community settings contrib - uted significantly to the challenge of initial development and ongoing maintenance of academic - community relationships . These mis - matches occurred on multiple axes : organizational structures , hierar - chical relationships , work cycles and timing needs , communication modalities and styles , and culture . For example , the periodic nature of academic work conflicted with the more constant flow of CBO work , resulting in differing expectations regarding speed and timing of proj - ect activities . In the 5 cases , research teams pursued a variety of strategies to assist with overcoming relationship and communication - related barriers , such as developing guides about common terminology within each group , defining rules and requirements of engagement , and discussing how different participating organizations worked . The fundamental differences in perspectives between researchers and community members occasionally led to differing visions of how research should be implemented . For example , in the HOPE project , the academic team wanted to focus on recruiting “high - risk” individ - uals from sexually transmitted infection clinics , but the CBO partner wanted to provide the intervention to any interested community mem - bers . Such experiences demonstrated the need to articulate the research design clearly and in writing to enable all partners to under - stand research plans . Concurrently , building flexibility into research plans proved important , allowing participating organizations to respond to emergent needs and urgent requests .

Wider research impact • Community members who were participating in the research used knowledge and motivation from study participation to promote healthy eating behavior among friends and family members ( Health Bridge ) . • Health care providers in emergency departments and hospitals used forms developed for patient health self - management ( Pain Action Plans ) to understand patient pain management activities ( Middle Tennessee Sickle Cell Project ) . • Several HOPE party hosts proactively disseminated pro – safer sex messages to their friends as part of social media contests and beyond ( HOPE Project ) . • A large proportion of the survey cohort ( 88 % ) agreed to be contacted regarding future research studies ; data sets are available to researchers beyond the study team ; infographics and the style guide and software for creating the infographics are available to others ( WICER ) . Better fit between interventions and target beneficiaries • Specific effort was devoted to developing instruments and measures that fit with the needs of participants , and that integrated well with the HOPE party settings ( HOPE Project ) . • Research participants rejected intervention concepts that the research team developed before prototyping with the community . For example , researchers included information about food costs in the app because food cost was a barrier in needs assessments . However , participants indicated this information distracted from the focus on health when they saw it in app form ( Health Bridge ) . • Infographic designs were refined through extensive input , resulting in rejection of simple designs that lacked sufficient context to fa - cilitate sensemaking ( WICER ) . More effective recruitment and retention of diverse populations • The project successfully recruited more than 500 African Americans , a demographic that is underrepresented in health informatics re - search ( HOPE Project ) . • Community organization staff’s awareness about what was going on in community members’ lives assisted with recruitment . For ex - ample , when we asked the program staff about whether a participant from an early research study could participate in the next phase of our research , they identified that the individual had recently had a death in the family and would have a difficult time participating . They identified another community member with a similar background who could more easily participate ( Health Bridge ) . • We used snowball sampling , whereby participants could identify other community members who might be interested in being in - volved ( Health Bridge ) . • The project specifically targeted a chronic illness that predominantly affects African Americans ( Middle Tennessee Sickle Cell Project ) . • Bilingual community health workers , snowball sampling , and incentives meaningful to the community facilitated recruitment of almost 6000 Latinos of whom > 80 % were immigrants ( WICER ) . Improved internal validity • Youth research assistants’ active , experience - engaged reading of interview transcripts assisted with refining unique themes about youth perceptions of HIV treatment ( Positive Youth Project ) . • Iterative refinement of infographic designs resulted in designs perceived to be acceptable and actionable ( WICER ) . More rapid translation of research into action • The initial phase of the project focused only on needs assessment , but rapidly shifted to incorporate development of technology prod - ucts to address patient needs identified through the research . Development and use of these products led to additional research op - portunities ( Middle Tennessee Sickle Cell Project ) . • Findings were shared with the local government , clinical institutions ( for community needs assessment ) , and CBOs prior to publication to inform actions by these groups ( WICER ) . Development of people • Several community - based partners chose to pursue further schooling , and / or later obtained employment in CBOs ( Positive Youth Project ) . • HOPE party hosts grew as leaders within their social networks . Project included training of youth as peer health information mentors so as to supplement the impact of the HOPE parties . Two attended the 2010 APHA conference to present . Project staff and volunteers obtained jobs in part because of experience gained in the project ( HOPE Project ) . • The informatics team included a local high school student and several undergraduate students with nontechnical majors . Working with the project led to development , educational , and employment opportunities , including the high school student presenting an ad - ditional informatics project at the AMIA conference ( Middle Tennessee Sickle Cell Project ) . • For 2 years , the Health Bridge team primarily had 3 male graduate students conducting the research . Since the community largely consisted of single mothers and their children , the PI ( a woman ) met with community members to check in on how the research col - laboration was going . The mothers commented that the male graduate student researchers were excellent , that it was the first time in their children’s lives that a man showed up when he said he would and helped them with what he promised to do . Likewise , the PI noticed that the graduate student researchers would reprioritize their own work based on their mentoring relationship . Indeed , some - times research meetings got cancelled because a child in the community needed assistance with homework or a science fair project ( Health Bridge ) . • Several community health workers transitioned to higher - level research positions with the academic partner ( WICER ) .

Assisting community partners with building capacity for research participation through funding and other development approaches was crucial to long - term collaboration success . For research teams , addressing student involvement in CBPR projects was also impor - tant . Researchers needed to balance providing educational opportu - nities with challenges related to student reliability and experience . In some cases , these challenges led to allocation of research funds to staff positions rather than student research assistants . In other cases , projects were able to identify mutually beneficial educational opportunities for students , such as Masters in Public Health stu - dents who collaborated on manuscripts with the HOPE project , and high school and undergraduate biomedical informatics interns who assisted with data collection and tool development in the sickle cell project . CBPR fundamentally challenged the researcher - led perspective on research activities , requiring that all parties accepted sharing the con - trol of research among partners . Some of the case studies , including the HOPE Project , employed approaches such as setting clear bound - aries and developing governance policies to address requirements of sharing control . Additionally , participation in CBPR projects required that both academic and community partners accepted loss of some control , which was not always easy or comfortable . A major division encountered in the cases was the need to plan for long - term sustainability for both the partnership and the research out - puts . Some trust - related issues encountered in the cases related to Table 4 : Challenges of incorporating CBPR approaches in health informatics and related lessons learned Challenge encountered Lesson learned Time and effort involved in building rela - tionships , rapport , and trust between researchers , community members , and community organizations • Many components are involved in building an academic - community partnership , including developing a common vernacular and defining collaboration processes . Plan appropriate amounts of time for partnership - building activities . • Academic and community partners need to equitably participate in meetings and partnership building activities . • Expectations about roles and responsibilities in the partnership need to be clearly communicated and understood by everyone participating in the partnership . Mismatches between academic and com - munity settings : organizational structures , hierarchical relationships , work cycles and timing needs , communication modalities and styles , and culture • Partnerships should consider developing documents to provide guidance about organization - specific terminology and rules of engagement . These written documents can help avoid misunderstandings and conflict . • Organizations have many formal and informal rules and norms . Openly and honestly discussing these rules and norms can help promote transparency and clarity in understanding different partner organizations . Differences between academic and community partner visions of how research should be implemented • Both academic and community partners need to respect that different groups may have different ideas about research and dissemination . Identifying and understanding the basis of different ideas is important to moving a project forward . • The study design , including recruitment strategies , needs to be articulated clearly and in writing . • When possible , partnerships should consider negotiating flexibility in research plans to allow responses to emergent needs or requests . Identification and recruitment of appropri - ate CBO and community member partners • Academic partners should place value on the local knowledge that community partners contribute to the effort . Community part - ners can use this local knowledge to help identify appropriate research participants . • Research plans should acknowledge that not all community partners or community members are interested in every facet of the research . Iterative opportunities for training and involvement should be provided throughout all phases of the research . Shared control of research by academic and community partners • Partnerships should develop written governance policies that cover roles and responsibilities . • Both academic and community partners must accept that control of research is shared between partners . • Partnership plans should identify clear times for renegotiation of roles and responsibilities within the collaboration process . Requirement to plan for long - term sustainability • Both partnership and technology sustainability needs to be considered throughout all stages of a project , from problem definition to results dissemination . • Approaches such as identifying and using technology platforms and community activities already in place can assist with long - term sustainability . • Discussions about project changes ( ie , grants ending , research assistants moving to other opportunities ) should occur on a routine basis with as much notice as possible for all partners . • Expectations for continued use of technology after a specific project ends should be discussed in advance . Impact of shifting contextual factors on longitudinal research • Academic partners need to understand that contextual changes may occur in the community , and these changes may impact research directions . • Community partners need to understand that contextual factors may occur in the academic organization ( eg , change in HIT security policy ) , and these changes may impact research progress or direction . Identification of resources and capacity ( including technology infrastructure ) needed to enable nonprofit community organizations to participate as research partners • Funding for community partner involvement in research activities must be included in grant applications ( ie , paying for a community member to assist with recruiting ) . • Grant applications should also budget for community partner technology infrastructure ( ie , hardware / software , training / development on technology , wireless or cellular services ) . • When possible , academic partners should work with community partners to build technological skills . Variability in access to and experience with different types of technology • Technology probes can assist individuals unfamiliar with different technology types with understanding the functionality and potential of these technologies . • Providing devices and equipment for participants to use during the study may be necessary . • Coaches may be necessary to facilitate initial use of technology resources in community sites , including basics such as setting up an email account that are prerequisite to use of many technologies . Ownership and maintenance of technol - ogy - oriented products • Partners should negotiate plans for ownership of intellectual property as part of contracts or funding agreements . • Early in a partnership or project , partners need to discuss expectations of conditions under which project outputs can be shared outside of the project . • Plans for maintenance of project outputs such as websites or social media accounts should be considered and discussed to ena - ble long - term sustainability of these products . These plans should include ensuring that the partner responsible for maintaining the products has sufficient resources to provide persistent access to technology - oriented projects beyond the life of the project .

R E S E A RC H A ND A PP L I C A T I ON S Unertl KM , et al . J Am Med Inform Assoc 2016 ; 23 : 60 – 73 . doi : 10 . 1093 / jamia / ocv094 , Research and Applications 68 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / j a m i a / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 23 / 1 / 60 / 2379975 b y gue s t on 02 M a y 2019 previous CBO encounters with researchers who collaborated on a proj - ect and then severed all contact after project funding was spent . To address sustainability concerns , research teams stayed engaged with CBOs over multiple project phases . For example , the Bridge Project has been ongoing for 5 years across multiple distinct project phases . To address technological sustainability , research teams in the cases pursued strategies such as using open - source technology and working with existing community programs and events . Shifting contextual fac - tors also posed a significant challenge to long - term project sustain - ability in some cases . For example , the Bridge Project encountered dramatic changes in population demographic characteristics within the geographic region they were working with , affecting their longitu - dinal study design . Academic - community relationships developed over the course of several years can be impacted by changes outside the control of academic researchers . Finally , the 5 case studies encountered a number of constraints and challenges specifically related to technology . For example , the informatics components of the sickle cell disease project were identi - fied after the initial academic - community partnership was established . Because the informatics components were not fully integrated into the larger collaboration , the project faced challenges related to access and contradictory goals . In other cases , the CBO partners did not have existing technology infrastructure to support a health informatics proj - ect . Providing funding to support technological requirements of research participation proved important in several cases , indicating the need for research partners to work with community partners to build capacity . For example , the peer health information mentors proj - ect was initiated as a supplement to the HOPE intervention study to address technology capacity issues among the young adults who were the target of the intervention . In several of the cases , research teams specifically sought to engage with minority and low - income popula - tions who had variable access to and experience with different tech - nologies . Research teams pursued strategies such as providing technology probes to enable people to see , use , and develop a greater understanding of different technologies . In some cases , researchers also included funding in grant budgets to provide devices and equip - ment to participants for use during the study . Ownership and maintenance of technology - oriented products were also an issue . Technology products and other materials developed through the 5 cases were typically built specifically as part of the research project , raising issues of ownership and maintenance of grant - funded yet proprietary outputs . Academic and community part - ners in the 5 cases contributed significant amounts of time and effort towards creating products and materials . Defining the conditions under which project outputs can be shared with others proved impor - tant for one of the cases , where a CBO requested appropriate compen - sation if materials based on their work were shared elsewhere . Maintenance of technology products was also an issue in the Positive Youth Project . A nonprofit partner managed the youth - focused website and games for a period of time , but once HIV treatment science changed significantly and a complete content rewrite was required , the maintenance arrangement was no longer sustainable . In another example , electronic forms developed as part of the sickle cell disease project became out - of - date with preferences and practices of the clini - cal teams . Maintenance and ongoing support for the electronic forms was transitioned from the research team to a group responsible for ongoing clinical informatics operations . This type of ownership transi - tion is not always feasible for products developed under proprietary software ownership models . Although none of the 5 case studies experimented with open access models of technology development , open access models could assist with long - term maintenance and sustainability if resources are available in the community to contribute to the effort . Extending CBPR principles for health informatics research Across the 5 cases , we identified common CBPR implementation pat - terns specific to health informatics research . Based on these patterns , we developed a practice - based “Implementation Checklist for Community - Based Participatory Research Projects in Health Informatics” ( supplementary appendix 1 ) . Additionally , the importance of CBPR principles in a health informatics project indicated a need to re - order Israel and colleagues’ principles to emphasize specific aspects ( box 3 ) . For example , empowerment and sustainability are particularly important and challenging issues to address in CBPR - based informatics projects . In addition , several novel principles specific to health informatics projects emerged from our analysis ( box 3 ) . First , CBOs may require technological capacity building , including both skills and equipment , to fully engage in informatics projects . There may be a need to train CBO employees on technology concepts and tools in addition to providing funding for hardware and software purchases . Moreover , training and technology provision may also be needed for intended informatics inter - vention users . Technical capacity building can have a significant , posi - tive impact on CBO staff and volunteers . One notable result from both the Positive Youth and HOPE projects was the link between project involvement and career paths for CBO staff and volunteers . For example , 1 of the paper authors ( TRC ) obtained a directorship in the economic and workforce development department of a local community college after working with the HOPE Project . Based on the experiences of the 5 research projects reviewed in the cross - case comparison , technical capacity building in CBPR projects can change lives . Second , the need to clearly define ownership and plan for the maintenance of technology - related project outputs is crucial for health informatics projects guided by CBPR approaches . For example , The HOPE Project collaborative makes sure that at least 1 academic and 1 community designee are approved through group consensus to be part of any new product , service , or data sharing activity . The WICER survey data are broadly available to stakeholders ; the infographics , style guide , and system for creating the infographics are open source . The degree of involvement of community groups and individuals in technology development raises important questions about who owns source code and products . Addressing ownership throughout all proj - ect phases is important for building relationships , developing trust , and ensuring equitable research experiences for all groups . Third , community - based informatics projects often integrate CBPR with UCD or PD approaches . This is illustrated through the use of 20 iterative PD groups to develop infographics in the WICER project . 64 The Health Bridge project also used PD and UCD methods within a broader CBPR framework . Specifically , the project engaged UCD in iterative development of a community - focused , sociotechnical inter - vention , including user studies , prototyping workshops , and usability evaluations . UCD provided a structured approach for the design and development process that supplemented the CBPR framework . Other PD methods may be complementary to CBPR and deployed in unison to develop community and user - centered health interventions . Fourth , informatics approaches enable multimodal results dissemi - nation , contributing to community technical capacity building and pro - viding opportunities for additional informatics research . For example , the WICER team explicitly built the Electronic Tailored Infographics for Community Engagement , Education , and Empowerment system 66 to return tailored infographics to research participants and CBOs .

DISCUSSION We provided insights into how a CBPR approach in health informatics research benefits underserved communities and researchers by map - ping 5 cases to an established CBPR framework . Our analyses showed that CBPR principles can be effectively applied in health informatics research , and that this approach resulted in concrete benefits such as research goals and products that addressed the expressed priorities of their target communities . Furthermore , we detailed unique , systematic challenges associated with informatics - oriented CBPR projects ; these will be important for health informatics researchers to consider as they contemplate using CBPR principles in their own research . Our analyses suggested that CBPR principles may need to evolve to account for the realities of CBPR implementation in health informatics ; thus , we extend the CBPR framework 9 with 4 added principles and a revision of others . Additional principles included the following : the need for technological capacity building for CBOs , the requirement to clearly define ownership and plan for maintenance of technology - related project outputs , the potential for integrating CBPR with UCD or PD approaches , and the capacity to enable multimodal results dissem - ination through informatics approaches . Changes to Israel’s CBPR principles included reordering the principles to emphasize empowerment and sustainability . Also , we offer practical implementa - tion guidelines in the form of a checklist ( supplementary appendix 1 ) . Researchers and community members must actively engage in building trust - centered relationships to successfully implement CBPR . The level and nature of these relationships is not typical of other research approaches , but is a critical CBPR component . Our cross - case analysis outlined the specific context necessary for building and sustaining these relationships and strategies to recognize and address communication barriers that may impact study design and project implementation . Our findings also reinforce the value of considering each contact with the community as an opportunity for engagement , especially during project planning . Including stakeholders in defining research aims , methodologies , and study designs establishes a com - mitment to engagement that can permeate subsequent project deci - sions , which is important in sustaining engagement with underserved communities . Technological capacity building was one of the novel CBPR princi - ples emerging from our analyses . While the CBPR literature addresses research capacity development among community members , we fur - ther emphasize the importance of technological training and the enhancement of technology access and infrastructure among both CBOs and technology users . This emphasis aligns with the broader lit - erature on capacity building , in which “capacity” is defined as the abil - ity to address a problem based upon the availability of resources such as knowledge or skills , social relationships / networks , and infrastruc - ture . 69 Moreover , we identified instances where working on CBPR Box 3 : Revised and extended CBPR principles for health informatics research Principle 1 : Understanding the existing strengths and resources within the community . The community , which has 1 or more unifying aspects , brings resources to the table . These resources are valued for their unique contribution to the research process . Principle 2 : Empowering both academic and community partners through co - learning opportunities , with awareness of social inequal - ities . Decisions are made in an equitable manner , and activities are planned and implemented collaboratively . Opportunities are made for partners to learn about community needs , strengths , and existing social inequalities . Principle 3 : Assisting community - based organizations and community members with building technological and research capacity . The project develops hardware and software infrastructures , sustainable technology models , and technological skills . Community members have the opportunity to learn about research processes and methodologies . Principle 4 : Building collaborative partnerships in all research phases . The community is not just included during data collection , but rather is included from problem definition through results dissemination . Resources are accorded to partnership building efforts . Principle 5 : Defining ownership of technology - related project outputs and planning for technology maintenance . Ensuring that all part - ners contribute to and agree with plans for technology ownership through all phases of research is important to building trust in part - nerships and enabling equitable access to project outputs . Because information and technology needs evolve over time , projects also need to ensure that plans are in place for maintenance of technology products . Principle 6 : Viewing research and partnership building as a cyclical and iterative process . Collaboration between researchers and the community is not a “one off” activity . Activities related to building and maintaining academic - community partnerships and refinement of research goals occur iteratively . Principle 7 : Integrating user - centered design or participatory design into CBPR projects . User - centered design and participatory design are complementary approaches to CBPR and integrate well into the iterative , participatory framework developed in CBPR projects . Principle 8 : Integrating research results for mutual benefit . The research team builds new knowledge and incorporates the knowledge into action through iterative cycles . Principle 9 : Incorporating positive and ecological perspectives into research and technology design / deployment . Research designs incor - porate perspectives focused on well - being and determinants of health . Technologies should be deployed within , and leverage , trusted social networks . Principle 10 : Disseminating knowledge to all partners through multimodal approaches that build technical capacity and provide opportu - nities for additional informatics research . Presenting knowledge through informatics - enabled approaches can lead to better understand - ing of research results and wider dissemination of results in the community .

J Am Med Inform Assoc 2016 ; 23 : 60 – 73 . doi : 10 . 1093 / jamia / ocv094 , Research and Applications 70 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / j a m i a / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 23 / 1 / 60 / 2379975 b y gue s t on 02 M a y 2019 projects expanded career opportunities available to community mem - bers . In a sense , CBPR itself becomes an intervention , because build - ing technical capacity can affect social determinants of health for stakeholders and technology users . As such , CBPR projects in infor - matics can be conceptualized in part as career and technical educa - tion for marginalized communities . One implication is that the CBPR process is worthy of dedicated funding , and that suitable funding sour - ces might reframe broader impacts to include workforce training and college outreach opportunities . Groups such as the Patient - Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( PCORI ) are beginning to acknowledge the importance of funding CBPR - related engagement strategies that include stakeholder development and academic - community partner - ship building through funding opportunities , including the Eugene Washington PCORI Engagement Awards and Pipeline to Proposal Awards . One opportunity that the work of this cross - case comparison has highlighted is the potential need to establish a community of prac - tice or other research consortium focused on CBPR within health infor - matics . This type of consortium , with appropriate funding , could assist with identification and dissemination of CBPR best practices within the informatics field and promote use of consistent , validated metrics such as measures of engagement and effectiveness across CBPR projects . Our cross - case analysis specifically pointed to the importance of ownership of research products . Research indicates that IRBs may not be experienced with considering implications of nontraditional approaches such as CBPR , particularly with respect to data owner - ship . 70 – 72 Empowerment through community engagement extends to joint ownership of data , or at minimum , to upfront negotiation on pro - cedures for the collection and use of data . 73 Researchers must con - sider data ownership guidelines , and anticipate that their existing IRB approval process may not adequately address data ownership and use at the level necessary for CBPR work . Given the intricacies of intellec - tual property issues in the technology field , we recommend that CBPR research teams directly address this issue prior to beginning data col - lection or technology development . Community - based participatory research approaches emphasize dissemination of knowledge to all research partners . However , a dis - tinct characteristic of CBPR in health informatics is the technological capacity for multimodal dissemination to various stakeholders , includ - ing research partners and technology users , other CBOs , community members , and policy makers . Our research identified several modes for disseminating research findings such as tailored infographics and zines , building on previous research using technology to disseminate findings from CBPR studies in novel ways . 24 , 30 , 44 , 74 Limitations The 5 cases were not selected based on their ability to represent all aspects of CBPR approaches in health informatics research . Rather , case selection was driven by the collaboration experience in prepara - tion and presentation of a panel on CBPR at the Workshop on Interactive Systems in Healthcare Symposium in November 2014 . The 5 cases were diverse in contexts and methods and , based on our literature review , represent diversity in how CBPR is currently applied to health informatics research . Future evaluations can build upon this contribution to health informatics research by further describing how applying CBPR principles can help address persistent issues concern - ing technology adoption and use . In addition , data for the cross - case comparison were collected and analyzed by researchers who were involved in the 5 research studies , raising questions about objectivity . The rigorous discussion and analysis process described in the meth - ods sought to address these potential concerns by allowing researchers from different projects in - depth access and insight into research studies designed and conducted by others . All of the au - thors engaged in extensive and robust discussion around all parts of data collection and data analysis for the cross - case comparison . The process provided researchers with alternate perspectives on research design and study implementation , similar to the process of co - learning that is a central principle of CBPR research . The aspect of personal involvement in the research studies also was in some ways an asset in data collection and analysis , providing greater depth of information regarding the inner workings of research studies , a type of knowledge that is often abstracted or limited in publications . CONCLUSION Through a cross - case analysis of 5 case studies , we examined how CBPR principles can be applied to , and extended for , health informatics research . We described specific benefits , furthering our understanding of how using CBPR principles can result in improved outcomes and increased trust . We illustrated how health informatics research projects can more effectively translate research into practice , as shown by tangible impacts to community partners . We also detailed challenges associated with the CBPR approach and strategies for addressing them . We encourage researchers to consider using a CBPR approach , particularly for research involving patient - facing technology and for outreach to traditionally underserved populations .
