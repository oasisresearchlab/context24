basic aspects of cell biology . Particularly in recent years , it has provided a wealth of information about new gene products involved in the establishment and maintenance of cell morphogenesis . Al - though morphologically simple in appearance , baker’s yeast is endowed with many of the same basic biochemical components that determine cell shape and cell polarity as those found in higher eukaryotes . Precisely because of its simplicity and ame - nability to manipulation by molecular and classical genetics , it has provided a valuable system for understanding how complex biological processes occur in the living cell . As in all fungal cells , morphology in S . cerevisiae is at least partly determined by the cell wall , a rigid structure that affords mechanical protection , dictates cell shape , and modulates the selective uptake of macromolecules . Without this barrier , the cell would be unprotected from environmental changes and would lyse because of osmotic differences with the surrounding medium . In the present work , we focus on our current under - standing of the composition of the cell wall and the biosyn - thetic pathways that lead to its formation , how cell wall dy - namics are regulated at genetic level , and how this structure adapts to the physiological requirements of the cell throughout the different stages of the life cycle in the budding yeast . A scheme of the S . cerevisiae life cycle is depicted in Fig . 1A . Micrographs from the different stages are shown in Fig . 1B . Vegetative reproduction of the typical oval cells is achieved by budding . The bud ﬁrst appears at the end of G 1 phase , after the START landmark in the cell cycle . The bud grows through the S phase , when DNA replication takes place in the mother cell , and reaches its ﬁnal dimensions at the time of mitosis . After mitosis , the cell cycle culminates with the formation of the septum that eventually allows the separation of the daughter from the mother cell ( i . e . , cytokinesis ) . Yeast cells divide such that the resulting cells have different sizes , and hence the released daughter must increase its size before it starts a new cycle ( 183 ) , causing a delay in the commitment of budding compared with that of the mother cell . Haploid and diploid mitotic cycles are very similar ; however , one notable difference is the preferred sites used by the dif - ferent cell types for new - bud emergence . Haploid yeast cells are of two sexual types : a and (cid:97) . Each cell type is able to produce a small peptide ( the mating pheromones a - factor and (cid:97) - factor ) that leads cells of the opposite mating type to both arrest in G 1 ( 237 ) and form projections on one edge of the cell ( 12 ) . The resulting pear - shaped cell is termed a shmoo . Mating cells interact by the tips of their projections , leading to cell fusion and , later , karyogamy . Finally , a bud emerges from the bridge that connects the mating cells . The a / (cid:97) diploid will reproduce vegetatively by budding if the appropriate nutrients are available . However , under appropriate conditions of nitro - gen and glucose starvation , it will undergo meiosis and sporu - lation , thereby producing four haploid cells : two a and two (cid:97) . Ascospores are round , and their wall is chemically different from that of vegetative cells . The cluster of four spores , grouped in a tetrahedral arrangement , is surrounded and pro - tected by an external envelope , which constitutes the ascus wall ( for reviews on the budding yeast life cycle , see references 55 , 191 , and 350 ) . More recent ﬁndings have pointed to additional cytological patterns in S . cerevisiae , such as pseudohyphae ( 166 , 242 , 271 ) and agar - invasive cells ( 363 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . Pseudohyphal growth occurs only in diploid cells under conditions of nitrogen limi - tation . The cells become elongated and grow in unipolar fash - ion to originate chains ( 166 ) . In contrast to budding in the normal yeast form , cell division in pseudohyphal growth is symmetrical , and thus mother and daughter cells undergo the next cell division round synchronously ( 242 ) . The other re - ported cytological pattern—invasive growth—occurs in certain haploid strains even in rich media . It also relies on the devel - opment of chained cells , although each cell remains ellipsoidal ( 363 ) . In spite of its apparent rigidity , the cell wall must be a very dynamic structure since it is susceptible to the many modiﬁca - tions that occur at different stages of the life cycle ( 29 , 115 ) . Substantial changes in the composition and / or structure of the cell wall take place during bud emergence , bud ( or mating - projection ) growth , septum formation , cell separation , cell fu - sion of mating partners , spore formation , and spore germina - tion . These alterations must be controlled by a strict regulation of the balance between the synthetic and degradative pathways for the polymers that constitute the cell wall and by the di - rected and targeted secretion of both active enzymes and cell wall components to sites where growth is required . Further - more , the processes involved in cell wall synthesis respond to cell cycle controls and to environmental signals such as nutri - ent levels or mating pheromones . A vast array of new genes coding for enzymes involved in cell wall dynamics and their regulation has been described in recent years . This information has provided new insights into how cell wall synthesis is di - rected and polarized in the growing bud , a process that relies on the actin cytoskeleton . Our aim with this survey is to offer an overall view of the cell wall synthetic and degradative ma - chinery and the pathways that may govern cell wall formation and morphogenesis . We are very aware that such a view is still very limited and focuses mainly on vegetative growth , since much less is known about morphogenesis at other times of the life cycle , for example during mating and meiosis . Therefore , most of what follows will be devoted to morphogenesis in the vegetative cycle , placing special emphasis on bud emergence and growth . CELL WALL MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE The cell wall of S . cerevisiae basically consists of three ele - ments , (cid:98) - glucan , chitin , and mannan , that are interconnected . Their distribution is depicted in Fig . 2 . 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - Glucan is the main component of the cell envelope , forming the construc - tional network in which mannoproteins ( mannan ) are an - chored . Chitin is present in small amounts in vegetative cells and is restricted almost entirely to the ring that encircles the septum in budding cells or the bud scar in mother cells . As shown in Fig . 2 , the cell wall appears as a layered structure under the electron microscope , exhibiting a ﬁbrillar outer layer , very rich in mannoproteins , and an amorphous inner layer ( 200 ) . The inner layer itself may also consist of two different zones : an inner , less amorphous one , close to the membrane and rich in proteins , and an outer one , facing the mannan - rich area , which seems to contain an important pro - 346 CID ET AL .

A small amount of chitin is encompassed within the bulk of glucan . For the study of cell wall composition , chemical fraction - ation of cell walls based on their different solubility upon treatment with alkaline solutions has been performed ( 13 , 200 , 239 ) . This yields mannoproteins ( at least 25 % of the wall weight ) and three classically known types of glucan : ( i ) an amorphous fraction that is soluble in alkali ( 25 % of the wall weight ) ( 143 ) , consisting mainly of glucose chains of up to 1 , 500 residues bound by 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - O - glycosidic bonds ; ( ii ) an alka - li - insoluble acetic acid - soluble fraction ( approximately 5 % of the wall weight ) which , in contrast , is formed mainly of glucose monomers bound by 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - O - glycosidic bonds ( 142 , 286 ) ; and ( iii ) a ﬁbrillar alkali - insoluble acetic acid - insoluble fraction ( 35 % of cell wall weight ) which seems to be responsible for cell wall rigidity ( 287 ) . This third fraction consists mainly of 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan , and its alkali insolubility is explained by the recently reported existence of a 1 , 4 - (cid:98) linkage between the terminal reducing residue of a chitin chain and the nonreducing end of a 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan chain ( 234 ) . In addition , it has been shown that chitinase treatment of the alkali - insoluble glucan renders it soluble ( 299 ) and that alkali - soluble (cid:98) - glucan serves as a pre - cursor in vivo for the alkali - insoluble fraction ( 181 ) . Therefore , now that the interconnections between polysaccharides are being unveiled , the classical distinction between alkali - insolu - ble and alkali - soluble (cid:98) - glucan fractions may be largely artiﬁ - cial . Extraction of certain cell wall mannoproteins by nondestruc - tive chemical procedures requires enzymatic digestion . Recent reports have proposed the existence of mechanisms that would be responsible for anchoring the mannoproteins to the cell wall ( 112 , 431 ) . These mechanisms promote cross - linking between the mannoproteins and 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucose chains , which are in turn attached to the 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan chains . Therefore , mannoproteins appear to play an active role in cell wall morphogenesis . As one might expect , this composition is subject to quanti - tative variations during the development of a new bud , which virtually lacks chitin and in which mannoprotein expression may be different from that of a mature cell . Such variations may be reﬂected , for instance , in the permeability of the cell wall , which increases in the initial stages of the budding process ( 113 ) . The chemical composition of the cell wall is apparently uniform around the ellipsoidal cell with the exception of the septum and the chitin ring that encircles it , which show a different chitin / glucan ratio ( Fig . 2 ; also see below ) . Upon exposure to mating pheromone , the cell wall at the mating projection probably shows a slightly different composi - tion , as deduced by analysis of the mannoproteins from (cid:97) - fac - tor - treated MAT a cells ( 189 , 265 , 267 ) . Changes at this stage have not only been detected in mannan ; glucan seems to in - crease its proportion of 1 , 6 - (cid:98) links , and the amount of chitin increases about threefold ( 142 , 388 ) . Thus , the mating phe - nomenon involves localized growth of the cell wall , implying the activation of glucan and chitin synthesis and the confor - mation of a different pattern of wall proteins . This probably leads to an enrichment of those required for cell fusion , such as agglutinins ( 266 ) or FUS1 and FUS2 gene products ( 424 ) . If the controls that direct the changes in cell wall composi - tion in mating cells constitute quite an unexplored ﬁeld , even more unfamiliar to us is the regulation of ascospore wall for - mation . Spores show a signiﬁcant amount of lipids and an increased quantity of proteins in their wall ( 43 ) . These pro - teins , rich in dityrosine , are probably speciﬁcally expressed during sporulation ( 42 ) . Chitosan , the deacetylated derivative of chitin , is present in large amounts ( 41 ) . Glucan appears more branched than in vegetative cells ( 142 , 443 ) . These com - ponents are distributed in an apparent tetralayered conﬁgura - tion ( 41 ) , and this results in a highly resistant structure , mostly because of the dityrosine - rich protein and chitosan layers ( 42 ) . Below , we discuss a series of biosynthetic enzymes and the possible regulatory pathways involved in the generation and maintenance of the cell wall , although the assembly of such a complex structure probably requires coordinated interactions and the regulation of a greater number of components than those currently known . A recent search for mutants presum - ably defective in cell wall assembly has opened the possibility of ﬁnding such new components ( 353 ) . For a recent review about yeast cell wall assembly , the reader is referred to refer - ence 231 . CELL WALL BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAYS Chitin Chitin is a linear polymer of (cid:98) - 1 , 4 - N - acetylglucosamine that accounts for only a small percentage of the cell wall dry weight in vegetative cells . The linear chains associate into microﬁbrils by forming hydrogen bonds between residues of adjacent chains . This leads to a crystalline structure that constitutes a structural component of the cell wall that is essential for the yeast cell ( 393 ) . For other reviews about chitin biosynthesis in yeasts and fungi the reader is referred to references 49 and 66 . Chitin deposition . In S . cerevisiae , chitin is found mostly in the bud scar , a craterlike structure on the surface of the mother cell after cell separation ( 13 , 60 ) ( Fig . 2 ) that is easily detect - able by Calcoﬂuor white staining ( 349 ) . The formation of the bud scar during the budding cycle occurs in several steps ( 68 ) . As soon as the bud emerges , a chitin ring is formed at the base of the growing bud , and the deposition of chitin at this location continues as the bud grows to the size of the mother cell . Then , chitin synthesis occurs in a centripetal fashion by accompany - ing the plasma membrane as it invaginates to initiate the sep - aration between mother and daughter cells . Thus , a very thin electron - translucent disk structure , the so - called primary sep - tum , is formed ( Fig . 2B , panel 1 ) . The deposition of additional cell wall material ( (cid:98) - glucan and mannan ) from both sides of the primary septum produces the secondary septum ( Fig . 2B , panel 2 ) . Finally , the two cells separate in an asymmetrical fashion . A birth scar is unconspicuous on the surface of the daughter cell and a more conspicuous structure , the bud scar , remains on the surface of the mother cell ( Fig . 2C ) . Besides the bud scar , the lateral wall also contains a small amount of uniformly dispersed chitin ( Fig . 2 ) , which becomes apparent after staining with wheat germ agglutinin - ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate complex ( 301 ) . Newborn daughter cells do not show detectable amounts of chitin , which is present only in the mother cells ( 371 , 393 ) . It is not clear whether this incorpora - tion of chitin takes place only the ﬁrst time that a cell becomes a mother or occurs repeatedly with each new budding . During the process of polar elongation , which takes place upon the conjugation of two haploid cells of complementary mating types , or in response to incubation with the correspond - ing sexual pheromone ( a or (cid:97) factor ) , chitin is also synthesized ( 388 ) . Chitin deposition occurs at the subapical portion of the shmoo tip , as can be readily observed after Calcoﬂuor white staining ( 267 ) . Under sporulation conditions , diploid cells are converted into asci containing four meiotic products or ascospores ( Fig . 1B ) . Late in this developmental process , the four nuclei are encircled by a double membrane ( 55 ) and cell wall components are deposited between the two membranes . Early studies sug - gested that the spore wall would contain glucosamine . Further - 348 CID ET AL . M ICROBIOL .

More recently , it has been shown that the spore wall consists of four layers , the second one made of chitosan , a deacetylated derivative of chitin ( 41 ) . According to the results of a study of chitosan biosynthesis in Mucor rouxii ( 104 ) , it can be assumed that chitosan would be originated in two concom - itant processes , i . e . , the synthesis of chitin and the deacetyla - tion of N - acetylglucosamine residues . Thus , chitin synthesis also occurs during sporulation . The following sections address the enzymes and genes in - volved in chitin synthesis . The functions and possible regula - tory mechanisms of the different synthases are also described . Table 1 gives a summary of these aspects . Chitin synthase I : genes involved and function . Chitin syn - thase I activity ( CSI ) is a membrane - bound enzyme that cata - lyzes the transfer of N - acetylglucosamine ( GlcNAc ) residues from UDP - GlcNAc to a growing chain of chitin . This is the major CS detected in S . cerevisiae and represents about 90 % of the in vitro activity measurable in a wild - type strain ( for a review , see references 57 and 64 ) . CSI shows an absolute re - quirement for a divalent cation : Mg 2 (cid:49) or Mn 2 (cid:49) . It is uniformly FIG . 2 . ( A ) Model of cell wall structure in budding yeast .

Solubiliza - tion by digitonin still elicits zymogenic activity , which in vitro requires controlled proteolytic pretreatment for its activation ( 129 ) . Extensive puriﬁcation by entrapping the enzyme in its own product has been achieved ( 223 ) . The isolation of a mutant ( chs1 ) apparently lacking CS in vitro but showing a normal growth rate and normal chitin contents led to the cloning of the corresponding CHS1 wild - type allele ( 51 ) . It was shown that the cloned gene was the structural gene for CSI and that its disruption neither was lethal nor affected chitin synthesis in vivo ( 51 ) . This suggested the requirement of an additional CS activity in S . cerevisiae ( see below ) . When a CHS1 disruptant grows in minimal media ( more accurately , in poorly buffered media ) , small refractile buds are produced ( 51 ) . The refractility of the buds is due to a loss of permeability . Under electron microscopy , bud lysis seems to be a consequence of the appearance of a hole in the cell wall , located in the center of the birth scar of the daughter cell at the time of cell separation ( 65 ) . The defect can be prevented by buffering the growth medium or by adding sorbitol as an os - motic stabilizer . A chitinase ( see below ) located in the periplasmic space , with a very acidic optimal pH ( 96 , 132 ) , is most probably responsible for cell separation owing to partial degradation of the chitin of the primary septum ( 247 , 376 ) and may also be responsible for lysis in chs1 strains . Reducing the chitinase activity level by increasing the pH value of the me - dium or by using speciﬁc inhibitors—such as allosamidin or demethylallosamidin—minimizes lysis in chs1 mutants ( 65 ) . Furthermore , double mutants carrying a disruption of the chitinase structural gene ( CTS1 [ see below ] ) and the chs1 mu - tation are not always lysed at acidic pH values ( 67 ) . The con - clusion from these ﬁndings is that CSI prevents the lysis caused by excessive chitinase activity at low pH and that CSI must therefore exert a repair function at the end of cytokinesis , counterbalancing the physiological lytic effect of the chitinase ( Fig . 3 ) . However , some chs1 strains do not show lysis . Genetic analysis has shown that the nonlytic phenotype behaves as a recessive character . This suggests that in addition to CTS1 , the product of at least another gene , SCS1 ( standing for suppres - sor of chitin synthesis ) , is required for lysis ( 67 ) . Mating and shmoo formation are apparently unaffected in chs1 disruptants ( 51 ) . By contrast , it is known that the synthesis of chitin in these events is due to CSIII activity ( see below ) ( 427 ) . However , the possibility that CHS1 plays a subtle re - pairing role during mating ( as happens during the mitotic cycle ) has not been discarded . In this sense , mating between complementary strains carrying both CHS1 and CHS3 disrup - tions merits attention . Also , sporulation and synthesis of the spore chitosan layer are not affected in homozygous chs1 mu - tants ( 51 , 336 ) . Chitin synthase II : genes involved and function . CSII can be readily measured in a chs1 mutant background . Like CSI , CSII is located on the plasma membrane and can be activated in vitro by treatment with proteases ( 385 ) . Two major differences allow a distinction between CSI and CSII as measured in vitro : ( i ) Co 2 (cid:49) is the best metal stimulator for CSII , whereas it inhibits CSI ; and ( ii ) the optimum pH for CSII ( pH 7 . 5 to 8 ) is more alkaline than for CSI ( pH 6 . 5 ) ( 385 ) . CHS2 , the gene that codes for CSII , was cloned by detection FIG . 3 . Gene products related to cell wall enzymatic dynamics at different stages of the life cycle . Underlined genes are related to synthetic pathways ; the nonunderlined ones correspond to hydrolases .

As with CHS1 , the transformation of Schizosaccharomyces pombe ( used as a heterologous system ) with a plasmid containing the CHS2 gene led to the expression of a CS with characteristics similar to those of the S . cerevisiae CS ( 401 ) . However , the use of S . pombe in these experiments as a nonchitinous yeast should probably be reconsidered , since some chitin and also some CS have been detected in S . pombe , as well as a DNA sequence with homology to the budding yeast CHS genes ( 38 , 400 ) . CHS2 was originally described as an essential gene ( 401 ) . However , it was later shown that in certain strains and under speciﬁc nutritional conditions ( namely , the use of synthetic medium or rich medium with glycerol as the carbon source ) , chs2 spores are viable ( 50 ) . Hence , the CHS2 gene was even - tually shown to be nonessential . Remarkably , a disruptant of both the CHS1 and CHS2 genes had no in vivo defect on chitin synthesis . Moreover , it had a measurable CS in vitro ( 50 ) . A third CS would be responsible for such phenomena . Initial observations indicated that no deﬁned primary septa could be observed in strains lacking a functional CHS2 gene ( 401 ) . Instead , thick amorphous septa are formed at the neck region between mother and daughter cells ( 401 ) and chitin is overproduced up to twofold compared with the wild - type level ( 50 ) . The cells are abnormally large and aggregate in clumps that are not easily broken by sonication ( 393 ) . Under normal conditions , nuclear segregation is accomplished before septum formation ; however , multinucleate cells can be seen in chs2 mutant cultures ( 49 , 50 ) . All these morphological alterations persist in the presence of a concurrent chs1 mutation . The conclusion is that the CHS2 gene must be involved in primary septum formation and , perhaps , in some related ﬁnal step of cytokinesis ( Fig . 3 ) . Chitin synthase III : genes involved and function . In retro - spect , it is now clear that CSIII was previously detected in a chs1 background ( 333 ) . Ni 2 (cid:49) is a powerful inhibitor of CSI and CSII but has very little effect on CSIII , especially in the pres - ence of Co 2 (cid:49) ( 83 ) . The use of different divalent cations and pHs enables the speciﬁc determination of three S . cerevisiae CSs ( 83 ) . CSIII was ﬁrst considered nonzymogenic ( 50 , 393 ) . However , recent results have shown that treatment of cell extracts with detergents leads to a considerable reduction in CSIII that can be not only restored but also increased ( 10 - fold ) after subsequent incubation with a protease in the presence of substrate ( 84 ) . Therefore , CSIII also behaves , at least in vitro , as a zymogen . The ﬁrst approach to the isolation of genes involved in chitin synthesis ( CSIII related ) took advantage of the fact that Cal - coﬂuor white interferes with chitin synthesis ( 370 ) ; indeed , under appropriate circumstances , it is toxic for yeast cells ( 371 ) . A correlation was established between the presence / absence of chitin and sensitivity / resistance to the ﬂuoro - chrome , and therefore a search for Calcoﬂuor white - resistant mutants ( cal mutants ) was undertaken ( 372 ) . To summarize , the main characteristics of these mutants were ( i ) resistance to Calcoﬂuor white , ( ii ) a considerable reduction in the amount of cell wall chitin both in vegetative cells and after (cid:97) - factor treatment , and ( iii ) CSI and CSII levels similar to those of the wild type . The second approach consisted of the isolation of mutants defective in the incorporation of tritiated glucosamine into chitin in vivo ( chitin synthesis defective mutants ) ( csd1 , csd2 , csd3 , and csd4 ) ( 48 ) . Complementation analysis performed by C . E . Bulawa indi - cated the existence of three different complementation groups for Calcoﬂuor white resistance : cal1 , cal2 , and cal3 ( with csd2 and csd4 being allelic to cal1 and cal2 , respectively ) ( 48 ) . Since the cal denomination had previously been used for a different purpose ( 329 ) , it seemed appropriate to withdraw it . Mutants defective in the chitosan and the dityrosine - rich layers of the spore wall ( dit101 ) ( 336 ) or resistant to exogenous Kluyvero - myces lactis killer toxin ( kti2 ) ( 52 , 419 ) also have mutations that map in the csd2 locus . According to a recent proposal for nomenclature ( 59 ) , largely endorsed by the authors involved in the discovery of genes related to chitin , the CAL1 / CSD2 / DIT101 / KTI2 , CAL2 / CSD4 , and CAL3 genes would now become CHS3 , CHS4 , and CHS5 , respectively , whereas CSD3 would become CHS6 ( all of them standing for chitin synthesis - related ) . Among all the chs mutants , only chs3 , chs4 , and chs5 are defective in CSIII in vitro ( 48 , 49 , 427 ) . It may therefore be concluded that this activity requires at least the products of these three genes . The CHS3 gene was cloned by complementing the Cal - coﬂuor white resistance phenotype . In parallel , cell wall chitin and CSIII wild - type levels were also restored ( 427 ) . Disruption of CHS3 is not lethal and promotes a phenotype identical to that of the original chs3 mutant . Cloning of CHS3 has also been described by Bulawa ( 48 ) . That report extended the CHS3 sequence 198 bp more at the amino - terminal region than did previous reports ; this difference is probably due to a sequencing error in the ﬁrst reported sequence ( 427 ) . The predicted protein sequence shows a reduced but statistically signiﬁcant homology with those of CHS1 and CHS2 , allowing us to consider CHS3 to be the structural gene for CSIII or a subunit thereof . Nevertheless , overexpression of CHS3 does not lead to overproduction of CSIII , and transformation of S . pombe with CHS3 does not raise CSIII levels either ( 427 ) . These results indicate that CHS4 or CHS5 or both are probably limiting factors for CSIII activity . The CHS4 / CSD4 sequence shows no homology to CS genes , and its disruption is not lethal ( 49 ) . CHS4 overexpression in - creases CSIII activity severalfold . However , simultaneous overproduction of CHS3 and CHS4 does not further increase CSIII ( 49 ) . The CHS5 gene has been cloned by complementing the Calcoﬂuor white resistance phenotype in a chs5 background ( 380 ) . Defects in the amount of cell wall chitin and CSIII activity were also complemented . The predicted sequence of Chs5p has a 19 % identity and a 70 % similarity ( over a region of 401 residues ) with that of the protein H of neuroﬁlaments ( 254 , 380 ) . It shows two structural peculiarities : a string of 10 heptameric repeats , and a C - terminal tail rich in lysines . Dis - ruption of the CHS5 gene is not lethal and mimics all the phenotypes ascribed to the chs5 mutant . Unlike CHS4 , CHS5 overexpression does not increase CSIII levels ( 380 ) . chs3 , chs4 , and chs5 mutants , defective in CSIII , have re - duced amounts of chitin in their cell walls ( 48 , 372 ) . Therefore , CSIII must be responsible for the synthesis of most of the chitin in the vegetative cell . Chitin deposited as a ring at the neck region between mother and daughter cells is clearly ab - sent in chs3 mutant cells ( 393 ) . The residual amount of chitin uniformly dispersed in the lateral wall of mother cells , which is detectable by wheat germ agglutinin - ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate complex staining , is also missing in chs3 mutants ( 372 ) . In fact , the increased deposition of chitin on the lateral wall of cdc24 or cdc3 mutants ( see below ) ( 362 , 404 ) is abolished in cdc24 chs3 or cdc3 chs3 double mutants ( 393 ) . Nevertheless , unlike chs2 cells , chs3 mutant cells keep the typical trilamellar struc - ture of the septa . However , these are convex rather than ﬂat as in wild - type cells , and , as a consequence , the bud scars are also convex and distended , giving the cells a ‘‘bumpy’’ appearance ( 393 ) . By speciﬁc staining with wheat germ agglutinin – colloi - dal - gold complexes , chitin in chs3 mutants can be clearly ob - V OL . 59 , 1995 CELL INTEGRITY AND MORPHOGENESIS IN S .

Additional relevant phenotypes ascribed to chs3 mutants merit comment . ( i ) The alkali - soluble (cid:98) - glucan cell wall frac - tion from chs3 mutants increases at the expense of the alkali - insoluble one ( 372 ) ; this result is consistent with the proposal that the insolubility of (cid:98) - glucan in alkali results from its at - tachment to chitin ( 13 , 299 , 399 ) and favors the recently con - ﬁrmed hypothesis ( 181 , 234 ) suggesting the existence of (cid:98) - glu - can – chitin complexes . ( ii ) chs3 mutants are resistant to exogenous K . lactis toxin , in agreement with the idea that chitin is the cell wall receptor for this toxin ( 53 , 419 ) . ( iii ) There is no induction of chitin synthesis after pheromone treatment in chs3 mutants ; however , although the shmoo displays a different morphology , mating is not impaired even when both counter - parts ( a and (cid:97) ) are CHS3 deﬁcient ( 372 ) . ( iv ) Sporulation in chs3 homozygous diploids is unaffected , but the chitosan layer in the ascospore is missing ( 336 ) . All these results clearly suggest that CSIII is in charge of the bulk of chitin synthesis not only during the mitotic cycle but also during mating and sporulation ( Fig . 4 ) , although its function is dispensable for the completion of these processes . CHS4 and CHS5 are limiting factors for CSIII and can be considered either modulators or subunits of such activity . However , they are not completely indispensable for CSIII . chs4 and chs5 mutant cells , unlike chs3 , have a low although detect - able level of chitin in the lateral wall and in shmoos ( 372 ) . CHS4 is not required for chitosan synthesis during sporulation . Rather , it seems that SHC1 ( see below ) may be its substitute in this circumstance ( cited as unpublished results in reference 49 ) . Neither sporulation nor synthesis of the ascospore chi - tosan layer is signiﬁcantly affected in chs5 homozygous diploids ( 380 ) . CHS4 does not seem to be a transcriptional activator of CHS3 ( 49 ) . However , overexpression of CHS4 or the addition of extra CHS4 gene product to lysates from wild - type cells does stimulate CSIII activity ( 49 ) . In addition , chs4 but not chs3 or chs5 mutants are able to produce trypsin - elicited CSIII in vitro ( 84 ) . Hence , CHS3 and CHS5 gene products appear to be necessary components for zymogenic CSIII , whereas Chs4p may be a posttranslational modulator of this activity . As deduced from its sequence , the structure of the CHS5 gene product favors its consideration as a protein that may form oligomers or some sort of ﬁlaments with structural func - tion ( 380 ) . CHS5 does not seem to be a transcriptional activa - tor of CHS3 ( 106 ) . Transcription of CHS5 in synchronous cultures has not been analyzed , but CHS5 mRNA levels do not vary from the logarithmic to the stationary phase , neither after (cid:97) - factor treatment nor during sporulation ( 380 ) . However , chs5 disruptants show a very early defect in mating and display a phenotype quite similar to that observed in typical mating - defective strains , such as fus1 fus2 double mutants ( 380 ) . Thus , the CHS5 gene seems to exert two functions : a dispensable one as regards chitin synthesis ( CSIII ) and another one that is very important for mating . It is difﬁcult to envisage a role for the CHS4 and CHS5 gene products with currently available information . They may serve as a structural component of a delivering system involved in polarity processes . Furthermore , it is well known that mutants defective in actin ( 319 ) , actin - capping protein ( 5 ) , proﬁlin ( 174 ) , verprolin ( 119 ) , other proteins related to actin function , or the putative components of the neck ﬁlaments ( 87 , 403 ) ( see below ) display an altered pattern of chitin deposition . It is therefore tempting to speculate that the CHS4 and CHS5 gene products would link chitin synthesis with morphogenetic events in which cytoskeletal or regulatory components were involved . Structure - function relationships in chitin synthase genes . Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences from CHS1 and CHS2 points to a close relationship between them ( 40 % identity in the last 750 amino acids ) . They also share a reason - able homology with CHS3 , mainly restricted to the C - terminal third of the sequences . The hydropathic proﬁles of CHS1 and CHS2 gene products are quite similar and differ from that of CHS3 . The amino - terminal region shows no homology among the three sequences , and a considerable portion of it seems to be nonessential . The CHS1 N - terminal region nonhomologous to CHS2 ( 389 amino acids ) can be deleted without loss of activity or function ( 66 ) , and deletion of the ﬁrst 221 amino acids in CHS2 does not affect the enzymatic activity ( 66 ) . By contrast , the C - terminal region appears to be essential , since removal of the last 75 amino acids in CHS2 or 43 amino acids in CHS3 leads to loss of the corresponding activity and func - tion ( 66 , 106 , 393 ) . The spatial alignments of CHS1 , CHS2 , and CHS3 , in com - parison with already crystallized related enzymes , identiﬁed a putative region for nucleotide binding ( 157 , 418 ) . According to this , Lys - 1125 or Lys - 1126 CHS3 residues would be essential . However , in vitro mutagenesis experiments were performed with negative results ( 106 ) . More recently , hydrophobic cluster analysis of a series of (cid:98) - glycosyl transferases ( including Chs1p ) has allowed the localization of two domains presumably in - volved in the formation of the (cid:98) - linkage in processive trans - ferases that use nucleoside diphosphate sugars as donors ( 384 ) . In fact , the essentiality of several residues located in these domains in a presumptive catalytic site of Chs2p has been demonstrated very recently ( 309a ) . The alignment of CHS1 , CHS2 , and a CS from Candida albicans ( 11 ) sequences allowed the identiﬁcation of conserved sequences that were then used to design PCR primers and the ampliﬁcation of fragments from several real or putative CSs from different yeasts and fungi ( 38 , 454 ) . In this way , CSs from C . albicans ( 81 ) , Neurospora crassa ( 453 , 454 ) , and Ustilago maydis ( 167 ) have been found . Moreover , the alignment of S . cerevisiae CHS1 , CHS2 , and CHS3 sequences deﬁnes different PCR primers , opening the possibility of searching for new CHS3 - type sequences among yeasts and fungi . Indeed , using this approach , a third chitin synthase gene from C . albicans , showing a sequence very similar to that of CHS3 , has been isolated ( 412 ) . Other genes involved in chitin synthesis . The CSD1 gene is deﬁned by csd1 - 1 , a temperature - sensitive mutant in which both growth and chitin synthesis are blocked at the nonper - missive temperature ( 48 ) . It has been proposed that CSD1 may be required for UDP - GlcNAc synthesis ( 49 ) . CHS6 / CSD3 is another gene related to chitin synthesis , but it is not required for CSIII activity ( 48 ) . It encodes a hydro - philic protein that shows no similarity to any known protein . Disruption of this gene has shown that it is not essential and therefore is probably not involved in UDP - GlcNAc biosynthe - sis . The SHC1 gene was found in protein database searches for sequences similar to CHS4 ( 49 % identity over 220 amino ac - ids ) ( SHC stands for sporulation - speciﬁc homolog of CHS4 / CSD4 ) ( 49 ) . A strain disrupted in the SHC1 gene synthesizes normal amounts of chitin during vegetative growth and shmoo formation . SHC1 mRNA is undetectable during exponential growth , but its levels rise dramatically during sporulation . It has therefore been proposed that SHC1 is required for chitin synthesis during sporulation ( 49 ) . Additional mutants resistant to Calcoﬂuor white have been 352 CID ET AL . M ICROBIOL .

Some of them show a defect in chitin synthesis similar to that observed in the chs3 mutant , while chitin levels in others are comparable to those in wild - type strains . Recently , a new Calcoﬂuor white - resistant locus other than those described up to date has been obtained ( 423 ) . Regulation of chitin synthesis . The existence of three dif - ferent CSs with deﬁned roles throughout the yeast life cycle suggests the need for speciﬁc temporal and spatial mechanisms involved in the regulation of their function . Temporal regula - tion can be achieved by the synthesis of the enzyme when required followed by degradation once its function has been accomplished . Another alternative would consist of rounds of activation and inactivation of a latent enzyme at the appropri - ate time . Spatial regulation requires either a mechanism re - sponsible for accurate location of the active synthase or a strictly located activation of a randomly dispersed enzyme at the actual site where chitin synthesis is required . CSI and CSII appear to be necessary only at a single moment and at a precise site during the mitotic cycle ( Fig . 3 ) . By contrast , chitin syn - thesis by CSIII occurs at several places and moments during the yeast life cycle ; therefore , it seems reasonable to assume that its regulation may be more complex . The GFA1 / GCN1 gene codes for L - glutamine : fructose - 6 - phosphate amidotransferase ( 442 , 447 ) , the ﬁrst enzyme in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway . Both the transcription of this gene and its activity levels have been shown to be increased by (cid:97) - factor treatment ( 442 ) . In the light of these ﬁndings , substrate availability may play a role in the regulation of chitin synthesis during mating . A similar suggestion has recently been made for Blastocladiella emersonii cell wall bio - genesis ( 102 ) . In principle , synthase zymogenicity reﬂects an in vitro re - quirement for proteolytic activation ; nevertheless , proteinase B , previously considered an in vitro activating factor for CSI ( 64 ) , is not required for CSI function in vivo ( 402 ) . Despite this , physiological activation of some CSs must be accom - plished either by other proteases or by some other unknown nonproteolytic procedure . As mentioned above , CHS4 and SHC1 may act as hypothetical posttranslational regulators of CSIII in the vegetative cycle and mating or in sporulation , respectively . As assayed after proteolytic activation , CSI remains constant throughout the cell cycle ( 82 ) but the transcript level of CHS1 appears to be regulated through the cell cycle and peaks at the time at which CSI is presumably required ( 336 ) . Expression of CHS1 under the control of a GAL1 promoter has been studied . After the cells were shifted from galactose to glucose , CHS1 transcription was turned off and the decay in mRNA and enzyme activity was monitored . CHS1 mRNA disappeared rapidly , whereas the activity remained fairly stable ( 82 ) . The transcription of CHS1 and the synthesis of CSI are clearly stimulated by mating pheromones ( 9 , 388 ) . The CHS1 se - quence contains four copies of the speciﬁc pheromone - respon - sive element at the 5 (cid:57) noncoding region ( 9 ) . In spite of these results , CHS1 disruptants apparently have no obvious defect either in shmoo formation or in mating . Therefore , the con - tribution of CSI to the synthesis of chitin in these morphoge - netic events appears to be unsubstantial . CHS1 transcription is not induced in sporulation ( 380 ) . In conclusion , the possibili - ties for transcriptional and / or posttranslational regulation of CSI remain open . CSII is also a zymogenic activity , although so far no physi - ological activator has been described . Transcription of CHS2 seems to be cell cycle regulated and peaks around the time of formation of the primary septum ( 336 ) . The level of CSII activity , measured after trypsin treatment , also shows a peak around the time of septation ( 82 ) . By contrast , in the presence of sexual pheromone or during sporulation , CHS2 transcrip - tion is practically abolished ( 82 , 336 ) . In a set of experiments similar to those mentioned above for CHS1 , it was observed that the levels of CSII activity and CHS2 mRNA decay rather fast ( 82 ) . From this , it can be concluded that CHS2 may be regulated transcriptionally , although strictly speaking , post - translational regulation should not be ruled out . Indeed , four consensus sequences for Cdc28 kinase phosphorylation are localized at the beginning of the CHS2 sequence . Much remains unknown about CSIII regulation , even though several genes involved in such activity have been al - ready cloned ( see above ) . Some ﬂuctuations in CHS3 mRNA levels have been observed throughout the cell cycle ( 336 ) . There is no information about CSIII variations along the cell cycle . The results on the decay of CSIII activity and CHS3 mRNA levels after turning off CHS3 overexpression in exper - iments similar to those described previously for CHS1 or CHS2 are difﬁcult to interpret ( 82 ) . Calcoﬂuor white presumably alters chitin synthesis by pre - venting the formation of chitin ﬁbrils and by interfering with the process of crystallization . Before growth arrest in the pres - ence of this chemical , chitin synthesis is activated at the level of the septa ( 370 ) . Paradoxically , Calcoﬂuor white is an inhibitor of CSs in vitro ( 370 ) , so its in vivo effect must be caused without its entering the cell ( 370 , 371 ) . Activation of chitin synthesis by Calcoﬂuor white is mediated by ( i ) an increase in CS levels ( presumably CSIII ) , which is abolished by cyclohex - imide ( 371 ) , and ( ii ) a speciﬁc activation of CHS3 transcription ( the transcription of CHS1 , CHS2 or CHS5 genes is unaf - fected ) ( 380 ) . This activation is apparently not mediated either by the (cid:97) - factor or by PKC1 - dependent signal transduction pathways ( see below ) ( 106 ) . CSIII and CHS3 mRNA levels remain constant during pher - omone treatment . The CHS3 gene has two consensus se - quences for (cid:97) - factor activation in its 5 (cid:57) noncoding region , although one of them may not be functional ( 49 ) . No measure - ment of CSIII during sporulation has been reported ; however , in contrast to other ﬁndings ( 336 ) , CHS3 mRNA levels rise drastically after 10 h under sporulating conditions ( 82 ) , at the time when later genes ( such as those involved in spore wall synthesis ) are expressed . The overall conclusion is that CSIII appears to be regulated transcriptionally and posttranslation - ally . All CSs are devoid of the conventional amino - terminal sig - nal sequence for secretion . Nevertheless , the delivery of these enzymes to the plasma membrane—the place where chitin microﬁbrils are vectorially extruded to the cell wall—requires a transport system . Chitosomes may constitute this kind of ele - ment involved in the spatial regulation of chitin synthesis ( 21 ) . It has been suggested that CSD3 may play a role in the spatial regulation of chitin synthesis ( 49 ) . As mentioned above , CHS5 may also be involved in this process . Mutants affected in the formation of the 10 - nm microﬁla - ment ring at the neck region in the submembrane between mother and daughter cells ( cdc3 , cdc10 , cdc11 , and cdc12 ) ( see below ) are defective in cytokinesis , and their morphologies are altered ( 56 , 87 , 182 ) . It is assumed that these microﬁlaments would play diverse roles along the cell cycle ( see below ) . Some arguments relate the putative neck ﬁlament constituents to the spatial regulation of chitin synthesis : ( i ) the disassembly of the neck ﬁlament ring of these mutants runs parallel to a disgre - gation of the chitin ring in the wall above this structure ( 87 , 362 , 403 ) , and ( ii ) mutants with mutations in the genes as - sumed to code for the components of this ring show a bumpy V OL . 59 , 1995 CELL INTEGRITY AND MORPHOGENESIS IN S .

Thus , a functional connection between those genes and CS is likely . Chitin synthesis as a target for antifungal drugs . Chitin is a fungal cell wall structural polysaccharide not found in mam - mals . Inhibitors of chitin synthesis are very speciﬁc agents against pathogenic fungi but are nontoxic to the host . This approach presupposes that the inhibition of chitin synthesis is lethal for the fungal cell . Single or double mutants lacking CSI and CSII or CSI and CSIII are viable . Searches for mutants defective in all three activities through genetic crosses between single or double mutants have been unfruitful , indicating that they may be nonviable ( 49 , 393 ) . In a different approach , a chs1 chs2 chs3 triple mutant carrying a plasmid containing the CHS2 gene under the control of GAL1 promoter was con - structed ( 393 ) . The mutant grows on galactose medium , but when it is transferred to glucose , CHS2 is turned off and the mutant cells ﬁnally die ; the lethality is not alleviated by the presence of the CHS1 gene ( 393 ) . Thus , chitin is essential for yeasts and can therefore be considered a useful target in the search for antifungal agents . The use of chitin synthesis inhibitors both in vivo and in vitro has been very useful in the study of the enzymology of the system , and for more details the reader is referred to other reviews ( 105 , 163 , 169 ) . In short , polyoxins and nikkomycins are very powerful competitive inhibitors of CSs , since they are structural analogs of the substrate . However , because of the existence of several CSs with different degrees of susceptibility to these inhibitors ( 58 , 161 ) , caution should be exercised at the time of choosing the in vitro assay when screening for this kind of antifungal agent . Two main conclusions can be drawn from experiments on chitin synthesis inhibition by polyoxins : ( i ) these inhibitors exert their action as expected , i . e . at the septal region and at the time of cytokinesis ; and ( ii ) unfortunately , in many cases the in vivo MICs of these inhibitors are much higher than the corresponding inhibitory constants as deter - mined in vitro . It appears that either inability to permeate the fungal plasma membrane or instability inside the fungal cell is the major remaining problem in the use of these drugs as antifungal agents . (cid:98) - Glucan (cid:98) - Glucan is the most abundant component of the yeast cell wall , and , unlike chitin , it is uniformly distributed around the cell . The major structural component is a large linear 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan polymer branched with some 1 , 6 - (cid:98) residues ( 238 , 239 , 287 ) . There is another minor , highly branched component , 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan with occasional 1 , 3 - (cid:98) linkages and 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - linked side chains ( 286 ) . For more information about the structure of yeast (cid:98) - glucan , the reader is referred to recent reviews ( 142 , 375 ) and to the section on cell wall molecular architecture , above . Enzymology of (cid:98) - glucan synthesis . Yeast cell wall (cid:98) - glucan is the generic name used to designate the complex structure that consists of a family of polysaccharides containing chains of 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - and 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - linked glucose units involved in the support and maintenance of cell wall integrity . Nothing is known about the biochemistry of the formation of 1 , 6 - (cid:98) bonds , but valuable information has been gathered on the biosynthesis of 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan by cell extracts from S . cerevisiae . After very preliminary trials ( 15 , 272 , 391 ) , in vitro biosynthesis of this polymer was efﬁciently achieved ( 394 ) . The sugar donor was found to be UDP - glucose , and the enzyme preparation required the pres - ence of EDTA , GTP , or ATP and other components for max - imal activity . The reaction product was characterized as a 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - linked linear glucan , and the activity was found in the plasma membrane fraction ( 394 ) . Further studies clearly showed that nucleoside triphosphates , especially GTP and its analogs , acted as powerful stimulators of the synthase ( 318 , 395 ) . These re - sults were extended to other yeasts and fungi belonging to different taxonomic groups ( 344 , 359 , 417 , 435 ) , leading to the proposal that stimulation of synthase activity by nucleotides might be a general regulatory mechanism for 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan syn - thesis . Dissociation of the activity into two proteinaceous compo - nents ( 222 ) by extraction of the membranes with NaCl and detergents disclosed the existence of a membrane - bound frac - tion , which seemed to contain the catalytic center of the en - zyme , and a detergent - solubilized GTP - binding component that may play an important role in the regulation of 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan biosynthesis ( 63 ) . So far , biochemical characterization of the system has been precluded by the great difﬁculty in purifying the components to homogeneity . However , a 20 - kDa GTP - binding component has recently been puriﬁed ( 300 ) . This preparation no longer required GTP for activity , although in - cubation with another fraction obtained in the puriﬁcation procedure resulted in the hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP and a concomitant requirement of GTP for activity ( 300 ) . Photoafﬁnity labelling with UDP - glucose analogs should allow the detection of the UDP - glucose - binding component of the system , as has been recently described for N . crassa ( 134 ) . The use of cell extracts from systems in which 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthe - sis is especially activated , i . e . , regenerating protoplasts in the presence of either Calcoﬂuor white or Congo red ( 370 ) , might facilitate this search . Genes involved in 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthesis . To gain further insight into the physiologically relevant mechanisms involved in yeast 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthesis , several genetic approaches have recently been developed . Different strategies have been used to isolate mutants and / or the genes involved , to different extents , in 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthesis . A list of genes involved in (cid:98) - glucan synthesis is given in Table 2 . ( i ) Genes deﬁned by resistance to several 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan syn - thesis inhibitors or by hypersensitivity to Calcoﬂuor white . One approach addressed the isolation of mutants resistant to antifungal agents that act on 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthesis , such as papulacandin B , pbr1 ( papulacandin B resistance ) ( 71 ) ; aculea - cin A ( 149 ) ; or echinocandin , etg1 ( echinocandin target gene ) ( 121 , 133 ) . Papulacandin B was one of the ﬁrst antibiotics reported to inhibit yeast growth by speciﬁcally interfering both in vivo and in vitro with 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthesis in yeasts and ﬁlamentous fungi ( 14 , 71 , 344 , 435 ) . ETG1 ( 120 ) and PBR1 ( 71 ) genes have been independently cloned and characterized by these techniques . A broader approach for isolating cell wall - defective mutants , by screening for hypersensitivity to Calcoﬂuor white , has re - cently been described ( 353 ) . On the basis of the known toxicity of Calcoﬂuor white because of its interference in cell wall assembly ( 370 ) , it was assumed that mutants affected in func - tions involved in the preservation of cell wall integrity might be more susceptible to this agent . In this search , 53 complemen - tation groups were reported ; among them , the cwh53 - 1 mutant and others displayed low glucose levels in their cell walls , suggesting a defect in (cid:98) - glucan synthesis ( 353 ) . CWH53 , the gene complementing the cwh53 - 1 mutation , has been cloned and characterized ( 352 ) . By sequence comparison , CWH53 , ETG1 , and PBR1 deﬁne the same gene . In addition , CWH53 is identical to CND1 , a gene whose mutation is synthetically lethal with calcineurin ( a Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - dependent protein phosphatase ) mutations ( 352 ) . Furthermore , ETG1 is identical to FKS1 ( 120 , 135 ) , a 354 CID ET AL . M ICROBIOL .

The CWH53 / ETG1 / FKS1 / PBR1 / CND1 gene codes for a fairly large polypeptide ( 215 kDa ) that was predicted to be an integral membrane protein with 16 potential transmembrane domains and a highly charged N terminus . The gene is not essential for vegetative growth ( 71 , 120 ) , although the gener - ation time of the disruptant doubles that of the isogenic wild - type strain and the morphology of disruptant cells is altered ( 71 ) . The fact that addition of sorbitol to the medium corrects these differences is an indication that the disruptant has an osmotically fragile cell wall . Indeed , cell wall fractionation analysis indicates that the levels of alkali - insoluble and alkali - soluble cell wall fractions of a pbr1 disruptant are clearly re - duced compared with those of the isogenic wild - type ( 71 ) . Furthermore , 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthase activity from disruptant extracts is reduced to at least 50 % of that of the wild - type ( 71 , 120 ) while the introduction of low - copy - number or multicopy plasmids carrying PBR1 restores the synthase activity to con - trol levels ( 71 ) . etg1 - 1 and pbr1 - 1 mutations result in echinocandin - and papulacandin B - resistant 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthases , respectively . No other kinetic properties of the enzymes are affected by the mutations ( 71 , 121 ) . From these observations , it can be con - cluded that these mutations speciﬁcally affect the interaction between the drug and the enzyme without interfering with UDP - glucose binding . In the case of etg1 - 1 , it has also been shown that the resistant phenotype can be ascribed to the catalytic subunit of the synthase ( 121 ) . In summary , the CWH53 / ETG1 / FKS1 / PBR1 / CND1 locus seems to be responsible for papulacandin B and echinocandin sensitivity as well as for normal 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan content and syn - thase levels . Thus , the product of this gene can be considered a structural component of the 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthase complex . However , it should be stressed that no UDP - glucose - binding consensus sequence ( RXGG ) ( 137 , 285 ) has been found in the encoded polypeptide ; this may be interpreted as an indication that the gene product might not be the catalytic subunit but , rather , another component of the 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthase com - plex . The residual synthase activity present in the disruptant , to - gether with the fact that the disruption is not lethal and the presence of a second sequence that cross - hybridizes with either PBR1 or FKS1 / ETG1 probes under low - stringency conditions ( 71 , 120 ) , pointed to the existence of a second homolog redun - dant gene . The papulacandin B sensitivity of the pbr1 disrupted strain ( 71 ) and the higher sensitivity to echinocandin of the residual synthase activity in fks (cid:68) 1 or fks1 - 1 strains compared with those in the wild type ( 120 ) also supported this hypothesis . Indeed , an FKS1 / ETG1 highly homologous gene , FKS2 , has been described , and the simultaneous disruption of both genes appears to be lethal ( 151 ) . FKS2 transcription is dependent on calcineurin and is strongly inhibited by FK506 and cyclosporin A ( cited in refer - ence 352 ) . This explains why fks1 mutants are hypersensitive to these immunosuppressors . In the presence of FK506 or in calcineurin mutants , FKS2 is not transcribed and 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthesis depends only on FKS1 . Since 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthesis is essential for the yeast cell , mutations in FKS1 in the presence of FK506 or cyclosporin A or in a calcineurin mutant are lethal ( cited in reference 352 ) . Regulation of FKS2 by calcineurin suggests phosphorylation / dephosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism for 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthesis and involvement of Ca 2 (cid:49) on it . CWH53 / FKS1 transcription also appears to be cell cycle regulated , showing a maximum in the late G 1 / S phase ( 352 ) . S . pombe papulacandin B resistance mutants ( pbr ) have been also isolated , and all the mutants deﬁne a single complemen - tation group ( pbr1 ) ( 71 ) , but the heterologous S . cerevisiae PBR1 gene does not complement their defects , in spite of the apparently similar behavior of the S . cerevisiae and S . pombe pbr1 mutants ( 71 ) . GNS1 is a novel gene which has been cloned by complemen - tation of a mutation conferring resistance to another echino - candin analog ( 133a ) . gns1 mutant strains exhibit a pleiotropic phenotype including a drastic reduction in 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan syn - thase speciﬁc activity as measured in vitro . GNS1 is nonessen - tial , and the encoded product is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with ﬁve transmembrane helices ( 133a ) , which may constitute either a subunit or a regulator of the 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthase . A different approach to the search for (cid:98) - glucan synthesis - related genes consists of the isolation of mutants resistant to the K9 killer toxin from Hansenula mrakii . This toxin has been TABLE 2 .

The KNR4 gene has been cloned and analyzed ( 197 ) . It codes for a protein showing 100 % identity to the nuclear protein coded by the SMI1 gene , whose disruption produces a temperature - sensitive cell cycle S - phase arrest ( 141 ) . The KNR4 product displays a hydrophilic proﬁle and contains several proline , glutamate , serine , threo - nine ( PEST ) - rich regions , usually found in rapidly degraded proteins , and several putative sites for phosphorylation by pro - tein kinase C and casein kinase II . Disruption of KNR4 is not lethal ; however , it promotes a considerable reduction in both 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthase activity and 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan content in the cell wall ( 197 ) but an increase in the chitin content ( 198 ) . It is suggested that KNR4 may encode a protein that coordinately regulates cell wall synthesis , either directly or by interacting with another regulator . Cloning of the gs - 1 gene from N . crassa by functional complementation of the cell wall defect of a 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthase - deﬁcient mutant has been reported re - cently ( 134 ) . The predicted encoded protein is partially homol - ogous to Knr4p / Smi1p . Overriding the effect of H . mrakii K9 killer toxin by overex - pression of wild - type genes has allowed the isolation and char - acterization of HKR1 ( for H . mrakii killer toxin resistant ) ( 248 ) , an essential gene that encodes a presumptive calcium - binding glycosylated type I membrane protein . Overexpression of the C - terminal half of Hkr1p rendered the cells more resis - tant to the toxin and increased the alkali - insoluble (cid:98) - glucan content but did not increase the in vitro measurable level of 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthase ( 248 ) . The mechanism by which HKR1 may regulate 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthesis is also unknown . ( ii ) Genes deﬁned by osmotic fragility . On the basis of the assumption that 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan is essential for yeast cell integrity , a search for S . cerevisiae ( 408 ) and S . pombe ( 359 ) mutants that require the presence of an osmotic stabilizer to survive at nonpermissive temperatures has been reported . Early work allowed the isolation of a yeast mutant that lysed in hypotonic solutions ( 32 , 437 ) , but genetic and phenotypic characteriza - tion of the srb1 locus has not been described . In addition , the isolation of thermosensitive lytic mutants ( 62 ) had afforded a mutant whose lysis was remediable by osmotic stabilizers , lead - ing to the isolation of the SLT2 gene ( 422 ) . Slt2p belongs to a phosphorylation cascade led by a protein kinase C homolog that is thought to be essential for cell integrity ( 252 , 289 ) ( see below ) , but no direct involvement of this cascade in glucan synthesis has been reported so far . As well as the protein kinase mutants belonging to that cascade , there are a growing number of mutants that require osmotically stabilized medium . The genes have been identiﬁed as encoding key pieces in intracellular signal transduction pathways , including protein phosphatases and small G proteins from the Ras oncogene superfamily . These results offer a new way to explore the mech - anisms that control cell wall synthesis and assembly and the interconnections of these mechanisms with other morphoge - netic events ( see the section on morphogenetic pathways , be - low ) . Genes involved in 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan synthesis . The yeast killer toxin is a small protein that binds to a 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan - containing receptor in the yeast cell wall before making its way to the plasma membrane and producing a lethal effect ( 205 ) . This binding is necessary for the toxin to kill sensitive yeast cells and permits a selection procedure for mutants resistant to the toxin that fail to make a functional receptor . In this way , a series of killer - resistant ( kre ) mutants partially defective in synthesis and assembly of that cell wall (cid:98) - glucan have been isolated ( see a list of the cloned genes in Table 2 ) . KRE5 is presumed to function early on the 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan pathway ( 295 ) . Disruption of KRE5 induces a very low growth rate , which is not alleviated by the presence of an osmotic stabilizer , and cells appear with aberrant morphology and even lack of viability in some genetic backgrounds . Kre5p contains the N - terminal signal sequence for secretion and an HDEL C - terminal retention signal for soluble proteins residing in the endoplasmic reticulum in yeast cells ( 295 ) . The KRE6 gene encodes a predicted type II membrane gly - coprotein . kre6 disruptants display a 50 % reduction in the level of 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan compared with the wild type ( 367 ) . The SKN1 gene was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of a kre6 mutant ( 368 ) , and it also encodes a type II transmembrane protein , which is highly homologous to Kre6p . SKN1 disruption has no effect on killer sensitivity or 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan levels . skn1 kre6 dou - ble disruptants , however , show a drastic reduction in 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan levels . It has been proposed that KRE6 and SKN1 would be redundant genes functioning in parallel in 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan syn - thesis ( 368 ) . KRE6 or SKN1 disruptions also lead to reductions in 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthase levels as measured in vitro , but no further reduction is found in the double disruptant ( 368 ) . The signiﬁcance of this result is not known . Recent ﬁndings indi - cate that Kre6p is probably localized in a Golgi subcompart - ment and that both Kre6p and Skn1p are phosphorylated and therefore possibly regulated by phosphorylation / dephosphory - lation ( 369 ) . On the basis of genetic interactions , Roemer et al . propose that the protein kinase cascade led by Pkc1 could be a candidate for the regulation of their function ( 369 ) ( see below and Fig . 6 ) . The KRE11 gene has also been cloned ( 45 ) . Its disruption is not lethal but leads to a 50 % reduced level of 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan , which is smaller than the one found in the wild type , although it contains a similar proportion of 1 , 3 - (cid:98) and 1 , 6 - (cid:98) linkages . Since kre11 kre6 double disruptants are lethal , it has been suggested that Kre11p may be involved in the control of Kre6p function ( 45 ) . KRE1 encodes a serine / threonine - rich protein that appears to be heavily O glycosylated ( 36 ) . It has an N - terminal signal sequence for secretion and a C - terminal hydrophobic domain containing a glycophospholipid anchor signal . The outermost proteinaceous electron - dense layer of the cell wall is missing in KRE1 disruptant cells ( 36 ) . This observation reinforces the hypothesis that mannoproteins are linked to the 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan fraction of the wall ( see the section on mannans , below ) . Disruption of the KRE9 gene , which encodes an O - glycosy - lated protein , produces an 80 % reduction in the amount of 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan . In addition , kre9 null mutant cells are multibud - ded and have lost the laminar cell wall structure normally seen in wild - type cells . They also fail to form mating projections ( 44 ) . SKN7 is a multicopy suppressor of a kre9 disrupted strain ( 46 ) . It shows homology to bacterial two - component response regulators , and it is interesting that it is partially able to sup - press the phenotype of protein kinase C mutants ( see below ) ( 47 ) . Double mutations of kre9 plus null mutations in the KRE1 , KRE6 or KRE11 gene are lethal in an appropriate genetic background . Kre1p is located at the cell surface , and Kre9p , when overproduced , is detected extracellularly in the culture medium ( 37 , 44 ) . KRE2 / MNT1 encodes a 1 , 2 - (cid:97) - mannosyltransferase involved in O glycosylation ( 184 , 185 , 194 ) . O - glycosylated proteins in budding - yeast cells have been shown to bear a linear polysac - charide chain of ﬁve residues ( 190 , 420 ) . Kre2p / Mnt2p is re - sponsible for the addition of the third residue to that chain . Kre2p belongs to a family of Golgi transmembrane proteins , including Yur1p , Ktr1p , and Ktr2p , which may be involved in glycosylation of cell wall mannoproteins ( 274a ) . PMT1 and 356 CID ET AL .

Mutants with mutations in the KRE2 / MNT1 or PMT1 genes are not apparently defective in the alkali - insoluble 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan frac - tion but are killer resistant . The defect in 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan is pos - sibly located in other cell wall fraction in which (cid:98) - glucan syn - thase and mannosyl transferase are both required . This type of chain may be involved in the cross - linking between (cid:98) - glucans and cell wall mannoproteins ( 302 , 433 , 463 ) ( see the section on mannans , below ) . Precise functions , either catalytic or regulatory , have not been deﬁnitively assigned to any KRE genes ( except for KRE2 and PMT1 ) . Nevertheless , on the basis of all the current infor - mation on these KRE genes provided by the team led by H . Bussey , it is reasonable to conclude that 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan synthesis appears to operate along a secretory pathway . Integration of the KRE genes in an ordered pathway has been proposed ( 368 ) . Recently , some new kre mutants have been detected among the Calcoﬂuor white - hypersensitive mutants , cwh , men - tioned above ( 353 ) . Study of these novel mutants might add critical information in the future to our current knowledge of the biochemical events that govern 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan synthesis . For a recent summary of KRE functions , the reader is referred to reference 231 . Mannan Mannan is a yeast mannoprotein with a high mannose con - tent that exists as covalent complexes with proteins . It consti - tutes one of the major cell wall components . According to their function , mannoproteins may be arbitrarily classiﬁed into at least two groups : ( i ) structural mannoproteins that form inte - gral components of the cell wall , and ( ii ) enzymes located in the cell wall or in the periplasmic space ( 10 ) , performing some trophic or morphogenetic role or simply in the process of being extracellularly secreted , such as invertase or acid phosphatase . Cell wall structural mannoproteins are large molecules , con - taining about 95 % carbohydrate , that can be extracted from the cell wall of intact cells without disturbing cell shape ( 294 ) . In view of this , mannoproteins have been considered a ﬁlling material , enmeshed in the glucan structural network . However , the protein component plays a fundamental role in the process of biosynthesis as an acceptor of different sugar chains and a guide through the different organelles along the secretory pathway ( 323 ) . The structure of yeast mannan has been well established , mainly in the work of Ballou and coworkers ( 18 ) . Understand - ing of the biosynthetic and secretional processes of mannopro - teins has been accomplished mainly in studies on three classes of mutants : mnn ( 17 , 18 ) , alg ( 202 ) , and sec ( 387 ) . The attach - ment of sugar chains to the protein is mediated by either N glycosylation or O glycosylation ( 245 , 420 ) , although recently another glycosylation pattern occurring through the attach - ment of a glycosylphosphoinositol ( GPI ) anchor at the C - ter - minal end of membrane proteins has been described ( 92 , 139 ) . For an updated review about glycoprotein biosynthesis in yeast cells , the reader is referred to reference 190 . Cell wall mannoproteins . Cell wall mannoproteins can be extracted by reducing agents , detergents , and / or enzymatic di - gestion with different hydrolases ( e . g . , (cid:98) - glucanases ) ( 154 , 340 , 396 , 428 ) . Pretreatment of cells with a speciﬁc protease re - moves the outer cell wall mannoprotein layer and facilitates the subsequent lytic effect of the (cid:98) - glucanase ( 463 ) . Another alternative consists of using regenerating protoplasts ( 429 ) , which excrete the mannoproteins into the medium , a method that should render additional information about the composi - tion of cell wall precursors and their interactions . It is difﬁcult to separate mannoproteins , because most of them run as diffuse bands in electrophoresis gels because of the presence of hypermannosylated N chains . The use of speciﬁc tools such as tunicamycin—an N - glycosylation inhibitor—or speciﬁc endoglycosidases may be very helpful ( 335 ) . The use of the mnn9 mutant , in which N chains are considerably short - ened , has allowed the identiﬁcation of some deﬁnite bands after extraction of cell walls with 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase ( 433 ) . Some mannoproteins are not sensitive to endo - (cid:98) - N - acetylglu - cosaminidase H , an indication that they are only O glycosy - lated ( 334 , 425 ) . Several cell wall proteins ( structural mannoproteins ) have been identiﬁed by studying their functions and cloning the corresponding genes , e . g . , sexual agglutinins ( 266 ) , ﬂocculin ( 441 ) , and mannoproteins involved in mating ( Fus1p ) ( 424 , 425 ) or S . cerevisiae killer toxin resistance ( Kre1p ) ( 38 ) . In other cases , the precise function is not yet known , i . e . , Gas1p / Ggp1p ( 325 , 426 ) . Some other known mannoproteins ( Exg Ia , Exg Ib , Exg II , gp29 , and Cts1p ) are cell wall hydrolytic en - zymes located in the periplasmic space , and their gene struc - ture and function are described in depth below . Attachment of mannoproteins to the cell wall . Cell wall mannoproteins follow the secretory pathway and ﬁnally remain somehow trapped in the periplasmic space or in the glucan matrix . Even if mannoproteins were joined by disulﬁde bridges and / or hydrophobic bonds , this would not be sufﬁcient to en - sure their strong linkage to the wall matrix , as judged by the chemical procedures usually used for their extraction . There - fore , at least some of them must be covalently bound to other cell wall components , for instance to (cid:98) - glucan . Some mannoproteins extracted from wild - type yeast cells ( 396 ) or the mnn9 mutant ( 433 ) by (cid:98) - glucanase treatment contain a small amount of glucose that is tenaciously attached . The glucose residues cannot be eliminated by either endo - (cid:98) - N - acetylglucosaminidase H or peptidyl N - glycosidase F diges - tion . Complete degradation of protein by alkaline hydrolysis releases not only the N - and O - glycosidically linked chains but also another one containing residual N - acetylglucosamine , mannose , and (cid:98) - linked glucose ( 433 ) . By using antibodies against 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan , it is possible to detect some mannopro - teins by Western immunoblot analysis ( 302 ) . The structure of the 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucose - containing chains is unknown , but prelimi - nary results indicate that they consist of about equal amounts of 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucose and 1 , 6 - (cid:97) - mannose residues . It has been sug - gested that Kre5p or Kre6p might be involved in the addition of the 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - linked glucose units ( 302 ) , but the enzyme respon - sible for the nature of the interlinkage between the (cid:97) - mannosyl and (cid:98) - glucosyl residues is unknown , as is the nature of the linkage of these chains to the protein moiety . The extraction procedure of these mannoproteins implies degradation of 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucose linkages , and it is therefore reasonable to speculate that 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucose - containing side chains might be extended with 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucose residues . Thus , a covalently linked glucan - mannoprotein complex would exist in vivo . Aculeacin A , an inhibitor of (cid:98) - glucan synthesis , causes a decrease in the incorporation of mannoproteins to the wall and the excretion of a particular mannoprotein to the culture me - dium ( 429 ) . On the other hand , a reduction in the cell wall galactomannan content has been described for a S . pombe spherical mutant resistant to papulacandin B ( another inhibi - tor of (cid:98) - glucan synthesis ) ( 360 ) ; cosegregation of resistance and round morphology phenotypes is accompanied by overse - cretion of galactomannoproteins into the culture medium V OL . 59 , 1995 CELL INTEGRITY AND MORPHOGENESIS IN S .

These observations suggest failures in a presumptive mechanism for anchoring mannoproteins to the wall (cid:98) - glucan . A GPI anchor constitutes another mechanism by which some yeast cell wall mannoproteins remain attached to the cell surface . (cid:97) - Agglutinin ( 273 ) and Gas1p / Ggp1p ( 325 , 426 ) are examples in which the GPI anchor mechanism has been stud - ied in detail . The GPI anchor glycan core consists of a residue of ethanolamine - phosphate - ( mannose ) 3 - glucosamine - inositol attached to a membrane phospholipid ( 92 ) . Transfer of the glycolipid to the protein takes place in the endoplasmic retic - ulum ( 93 ) . The anchor is attached to the protein at the non - reducing end of the glycan chain and can be removed by a speciﬁc phospholipase C ( 148 ) . GPI - anchored proteins have both a hydrophobic N - terminal signal sequence and a hydro - phobic C - terminal peptide that is cleaved and replaced with the GPI anchor by a C - terminal transaminidase . The GAA1 gene product is involved in this function ( 178 ) . The determi - nants for GPI anchoring and the site of cleavage have been described previously ( 164 , 324 , 325 ) . In short , these GPI - an - chored proteins are synthesized as precursors with a serine - rich region , immediately followed by a pair of small residues ( Ser , Gly , Ala , Asp , Asn , or Cys ) positioned 10 to 12 residues N - terminal to a C - terminal domain composed mainly of hy - drophobic amino acids . Anchor addition involves a coordi - nated processing event in which the precursor is cleaved at the level of the small residue motif , thus removing the hydrophobic C - terminal domain to the nascent protein , followed by the attachment of the GPI group to the new C terminus ( 69 , 266 ) . Elimination or alteration of the C - terminal domain in Gas1p / Ggp1p protein results in secretion of the protein to the me - dium ( 325 ) . The isolation of temperature - sensitive mutants defective in GPI anchoring might help in the study of the fate of many cell surface mannoproteins ( 262 ) . The CWH6 / SPT14 gene product , which was isolated by complementation of one of the Calcoﬂuor white hypersensitive mutants ( 353 ) , is prob - ably responsible for the transfer of N - acetylglucosamine to a precursor of the GPI anchor ( 439a ) . A cwh6 mutant shows a decrease of 50 % in the amount of mannan in the cell wall ( 439a ) , suggesting that GPI anchoring is a key mechanism for the incorporation of an important number of mannoproteins into the yeast cell wall . It is known that mature (cid:97) - agglutinin is anchored to the cell wall rather than to the plasma membrane . Accordingly , it has been speculated that GPI anchorage of some proteins to the membrane might be an intermediate form in a process in which cross - linking with other cell wall components is ﬁnally achieved ( 112 ) . In the case of (cid:97) - agglutinin , this process has been dem - onstrated ( 273 ) . Glycosylation and attachment to the S . cerevi - siae cell wall of chimeric proteins extended with the C - terminal 30 amino acids of (cid:97) - agglutinin have also been reported ( 431 ) . Furthermore , anchoring of the chimeric proteins is apparently mediated by 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan chains , as in the case of the manno - proteins mentioned above . Other GPI - anchored mannopro - teins are probably cross - linked to the wall by the same proce - dure . The mechanism of these cross - linking reactions is not known , but it may act in the periplasmic space by transglyco - sylation . Recently , several possibilities have been proposed ( 112 ) . The existence of that type of reactions affords a new perspective about the role of mannoproteins in morphogenesis being more active than previously thought ( 392 ) . In addition , these reactions may be considered selective targets for the development of new antifungal agents . GPI addition to cell wall mannoproteins is necessary for subsequent cross - linking to other cell wall components but is not sufﬁcient to specify cell wall location . Indeed , there is at least one mannoprotein , Gas1p / Ggp1p , that is apparently not associated with the cell wall but , rather , with the plasma mem - brane . Recent results suggest that GAS1 / GGP1 would be a gene with an important morphogenetic role . Disruption of GAS1 / GGP1 reveals several defects in the vegetative cycle ( 347 ) . The cells are round , have reduced viability in the sta - tionary phase , and display an increase and delocalization of chitin synthesis . More recently , it has been shown that CWH52 , a gene that complements Calcoﬂuor white hypersensitivity of the corresponding mutant , is identical to GAS1 / GGP1 ( 352 ) . Transcription of CWH52 is cell cycle regulated , and cwh52 mutants have a reduced cell wall glucose content . Finally , strains with null mutations of PHR1 , a pH - regulated gene of C . albicans that codes for a protein 56 % identical to Gas1p / Ggp1p , exhibit a pH - conditional morphological defect ( 383 ) . Under alkaline pH conditions , the mutant is unable to achieve apical growth and cells became rounded , highly enlarged , and multibudded , although actin distribution and secretion are not affected . Phr1p function either is not required at acidic pH or is performed by a homolog functioning at low pH ( 383 ) . Phr1p and , by extrapolation , Gas1 / Ggp1 / Cwh52p may play an essen - tial and speciﬁc role in directing apical growth . However , its extracellular location is consistent with a morphogenetic role related to cell wall assembly . It would be interesting to be able to assign an enzymatic function to Gas1p / Ggp1p . CELL WALL HYDROLYTIC ENZYMES Assembly of externalized cell wall components into a su - pramolecular organelle with speciﬁc morphology presumably occurs through extensive interaction among various enzymatic , chemical , and physical forces , whose nature is completely un - known . Two mechanisms to explain the incorporation of new wall material into a preexisting fabric have been proposed . One states that cell wall expansion may involve a continuous pro - cess of synthesis and degradation and that new building blocks are inserted at growth sites in which bonds in recently formed cell wall are cleaved . This notion of wall growth as a dynamic balance of lytic - and ligase - type activities ( 215 ) receives con - tinued support , although deﬁnitive proof of this concept is still lacking . The second explanation is that new wall would grow by a process of intussusception before cross - links are made and rigidity sets in ; cell wall polymers , which at the growing points may not be completely solidiﬁed by cross - links , slide apart , thus providing an area for insertion of new material . There are , however , instances in which it is necessary that old ( presum - ably ﬁnished ) wall be broken , such as bud emergence . In this case , it seems imperative to soften the old wall by some hy - drolytic process to allow emergence of the new growth ( 61 , 64 ) . Whatever the mechanism , it seems clear that at some mo - ments , a highly localized breakage of the existing wall occurs , and , consistent with this , a number of autolytic hydrolases have been reported to be associated with the yeast envelope , includ - ing glucanase , chitinase , and (cid:97) - mannosidase activities . The genes associated with cell wall hydrolysis are listed in Table 3 . Glucanases As mentioned in previous sections , 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan constitutes the main structural polysaccharide responsible for the shape and rigidity of the yeast cell envelope . Although the yeast cell wall glucans do not undergo appreciable turnover during veg - etative growth ( 240 , 439 ) , limited site - directed hydrolysis of the rigid skeletal wall (cid:98) - glucans , mediated by endogenous (cid:98) - glu - canases , probably takes place during various morphogenetic 358 CID ET AL . M ICROBIOL . R EV . on F eb r ua r y 21 , 2013 b y PE NN S T A T E UN I V h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m processes , such as budding , wall growth , conjugation , and ascus formation ( 316 ) . Two broad classes of 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase activity occur in yeasts , namely , the exoglucanases and the endoglu - canases . As measured by their activity on the substrate lami - narin ( a linear 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan ) , exo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanases account for the greater part of total glucanase activity in yeasts and hydro - lyze the (cid:98) - O - glycosidic linkages at the nonreducing end of the polymer chain , resulting in the release of glucose . These en - zymes are not particularly speciﬁc , because they usually act also on 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - linkages ( as measured against pustulan , a linear 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan substrate ) , although with less efﬁciency . Endo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanases attack the linkages at intermediate points of the polymer chain , releasing a mixture of oligosaccharides with glucose as a minor product . For a number of years , the complement of glucan - hydrolyz - ing enzymes in vegetatively growing S . cerevisiae cells seemed to be well characterized and simple and was attributed to three glycoprotein forms , synthesized constitutively , which are ﬁrst secreted to the periplasmic space and then released into the culture medium , where they accumulate . The major form is an exo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase ( formerly Exg II and hereafter Exg Ib ) that hydrolyzes both 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - and 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - linkages ( the latter to a lesser extent ) and even has (cid:98) - glucosidase activity , since it also acts on synthetic glucosides such as p - nitrophenyl - (cid:98) - glucoside and 4 - methylumbelliferyl - (cid:98) - glucoside . The second form is also a nonspeciﬁc exo - (cid:98) - glucanase ( formerly Exg I and hereafter Exg Ia ) , which has an identical protein portion to the major exo - (cid:98) - glucanase , although it differs in having a higher content of the carbohydrate moiety . Finally , a high - M r endo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase is also present but in smaller amounts ( 30 , 138 , 377 ) . In turn , the meiotic cycle leads to the induction of a new exo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase which is not present in vegetatively grow - ing cells and which is therefore speciﬁcally associated with the sporulation process ( 109 , 110 ) . Current knowledge , however , suggests that the yeast glu - canase system is more complex and points to the existence of minor forms , some being present in very small amounts , which might be secreted to remain in the cell wall rather than in the periplasmic space or to be released into the culture ﬂuid . Thus , using mutant strains defective in the aforementioned Exg Ia and Exg Ib exo - (cid:98) - glucanases , Cenamor et al . ( 72 ) reported two additional glucan - hydrolyzing enzymes . These glucanases , de - tected in protoplast lysates but undetectable in cell extracts and in culture ﬂuids , are secreted by protoplasts under regenera - tion conditions , when many of the secreted proteins cannot become entrapped in the wall structure . Along the same lines , Klebl and Tanner ( 230 ) puriﬁed a tightly bound cell wall gly - coprotein , with an apparent molecular mass of 29 kDa ( gp29 ) , which speciﬁcally binds to insoluble S . cerevisiae glucan and chitin and was shown to exhibit endo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase activity . Interestingly , this cell wall - associated enzyme is widely distrib - uted and highly conserved among yeasts , since proteins related to gp29 , with M r s ranging from 31 , 500 to 34 , 000 depending on the species , have been detected by immunoblotting in C . albi - cans , Hansenula wingei , Torulopsis glabrata , Pichia guilliermon - dii , and K . lactis ( 180 , 188 , 230 ) . Genetic characterization . In recent years , much work has focused on the characterization of the genetic system govern - ing 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase synthesis in yeasts . Genetic approaches were initiated by the isolation of S . cerevisiae mutants with highly reduced exo - (cid:98) - glucanase activity by a screening method based on the capacity of these enzymes to hydrolyze synthetic derivatives , such as the ﬂuorogenic substrate 4 - methylumbel - liferyl - (cid:98) - glucoside ( 381 ) . By functional complementation of the chromosomal mutation harbored by these strains ( exg1 ) , it was possible to clone and identify two different fragments that were able to restore the capacity to hydrolyze MUG . One of the fragments contains a structural gene ( EXG1 ) coding for a protein whose differential glycosylation accounts for the two main extracellular exo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanases ( Exg Ia and Exg Ib ) in culture supernatants of S . cerevisiae . The second fragment identiﬁed produces only partial complementation of the Exg (cid:50) phenotype of exg1 strains and contains a gene ( EXG2 ) that codes for a minor exo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase exhibiting a high carbo - hydrate content , which has been designated Exg II ( formerly Exg III ) ( 313 , 314 , 354 ) . EXG1 , which has also been cloned selecting for overproduc - ers ( BGL1 ) ( 246 ) , is 1 , 344 nucleotides in length and encodes a 51 . 3 - kDa polypeptide which contains two potential N - glycosy - lation sites . The putative precursor contains an N - terminal extended peptide of 40 amino acids that is cleaved off during the process of protein externalization . Since the cleaved site is preceded by a pair of basic amino acid residues ( Lys - Arg ) , which is one of the proteolytic processing signals of a trypsin - like endoprotease encoded by the KEX2 gene , this ﬁnding raises the possibility that these exo - (cid:98) - glucanases ( Exg Ia and Exg Ib ) are synthesized as a precursor protein whose matura - tion involves the removal of the signal peptide by the signal peptidase during translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum , followed by proteolytic processing in the Golgi complex by the KEX2 endoprotease . It is interesting that although this pro - cessing has been shown to occur in extracellular polypeptides , such as (cid:97) - factor or the killer toxin , it has not been described for any of the other secreted glycoproteins with enzymatic activity , such as invertase , (cid:97) - galactosidase , or the acid phosphatases , which are also targeted to the cell surface and follow the same secretory pathway ( 22 , 436 ) . Sequencing analysis of the EXG2 gene shows a single open reading frame of 1 , 686 bp encoding a 63 . 5 - kDa polypeptide which contains 14 tripeptide sequences , Asn - X - Thr or Asn - X - Ser , whose N - glycosylation may account for the high molecular mass of the mature enzyme ( (cid:59) 200 kDa ) .

As in the case of the EXG1 product , the N - terminal region of the putative precursor encoded by the EXG2 gene is a very hydrophobic segment with structural features resem - bling those of signal peptides of secreted proteins . In contrast to the EXG1 - encoded glucanase , which is efﬁciently secreted to the periplasmic space and then released into the surrounding medium , only about 5 % of the EXG2 - encoded exo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glu - canase ( Exg II ) is detected in the culture supernatant . Subcel - lular fractionation experiments show that most of the cell - retained activity is associated with the cell wall structure . Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of this exo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase with those of other reported yeast cell wall - associated proteins reveals a C - terminal structure characteris - tic of polypeptides attached to the plasma membrane through a GPI anchor ( see above ) ( 268 , 325 , 374 ) . As in the case of Gas1p / Ggp1p , a truncated Exg II mutant protein lacking the 69 C - terminal residues , including the serine - rich region , the putative GPI attachment site ( KNAA ) , and the hydrophobic C terminus , is not localized in the cell wall structure but , rather , is mostly released into the medium , thus pointing to a direct involvement of the C terminus of the primary translation prod - uct in the correct location of the mature wild - type Exg II 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase ( 94 ) . The gene ( BGL2 ) for the gp29 cell wall - associated endo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase was molecularly cloned by screening a genomic library for hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotides de - duced from the N - terminal sequence of the native protein . BGL2 encodes a polypeptide of 313 residues with a typical 23 - amino - acid signal peptide and two potential N - glycosylation sites , only one of them bearing oligosaccharide chains attached to the asparagine residue ( 230 , 304 ) . As mentioned above , the gp29 glucanase exhibits an endo - hydrolytic mode of action , this peculiarity being reﬂected in the primary structure of the pro - tein when compared with the EXG1 - and EXG2 - encoded exo - glucanases . Alignment of the predicted sequence of the mature proteins encoded by BGL2 and EXG1 does not reveal a sig - niﬁcant degree of homology ; instead , the BGL2 product dis - plays considerable similarity to plant 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanases , such as those from barley aleurone and tobacco cells ( 140 , 398 ) . Two groups have independently isolated and characterized the gene ( SSG1 / SPR1 ) encoding the sporulation - speciﬁc exo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase . SSG1 was cloned by screening a genomic li - brary with a DNA probe obtained by PCR ampliﬁcation with synthetic oligonucleotides designed according to the nucle - otide sequence predicted from the N - terminal region of the puriﬁed protein ( 379 ) . In an alternative approach , SPR1 was identiﬁed by differential hybridization screening for genes tran - scribed preferentially during sporulation ( 88 , 308 ) . SSG1 is 1 , 335 nucleotides in length and encodes a 51 . 7 - kDa polypep - tide , which contains one potential N - glycosylation site and exhibits a strong homology to the EXG1 - encoded polypeptide ( 76 % similarity with conservative substitutions ) . Northern ( RNA ) blot analysis discloses a unique SSG1 - speciﬁc tran - script which is present only in sporulating diploids ( MAT a / MAT (cid:97) ) and does not appear in vegetatively growing cells or in nonsporulating diploids ( MAT (cid:97) / MAT (cid:97) ) when incubated under nitrogen starvation conditions . The meiotic time course of SSG1 induction , monitored by Northern analyses carried out with MAT a / MAT (cid:97) cells at various times during the sporulation process , indicates a temporal pattern of expression that resem - bles that of the previously described late class of sporulation - speciﬁc transcripts , appearing at the time of meiosis I and reaching a maximum during spore formation ( 195 , 219 ) . Assessing a biological function for yeast glucanases . The large body of information currently available concerning at least some of the genes involved in this complex system has now opened the way for molecular biology approaches based on the isolation and characterization of mutants altered or defective in (cid:98) - glucanase production . The expectations gener - ated , however , have not been reﬂected in direct experimental evidence for the biological role of these proteins in controlled modiﬁcations of the yeast cell envelope . Characterization of chemically induced exg1 mutants led to the unexpected dem - onstration that the Exg Ia and Exg Ib enzymes , by far the most abundant (cid:98) - glucanases in S . cerevisiae , do not play an essential role in morphogenesis , since cells devoid of this activity were able to grow , mate , and sporulate normally ( 381 , 382 ) . It was argued that tiny , undetectable amounts of exo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase activity , sufﬁcient to accomplish its biological role , could still be produced because of leakiness of the mutation . Deletion of the EXG1 gene , however , conﬁrmed the dispensability of these enzymes , because exg1 null mutants behave in the same way as the parental strains with respect to all features investigated , such as growth , osmotic stability , mating , and sporulation of the homozygous diploid ( 314 ) . As an explanation , it was ar - gued that the EXG1 - encoded glucanases are simply (cid:98) - glucosi - dases that happen to act on 1 , 3 - (cid:98) and 1 , 6 - (cid:98) linkages of glucan but are produced for metabolic and not for morphogenetic purposes ( 361 ) . However , the certitude of this conjecture is questioned by two facts : ( i ) Exg Ia and Exg Ib production is growth associated ( 108 , 331 ) , unlike that of metabolic hydro - lases , which are usually subjected to catabolite repression ; and ( ii ) overexpression of EXG1 causes a killer toxin resistance phenotype reminiscent of that of the kre mutants ( 214 ) , sug - gesting that 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan may be an in vivo target for Exg Ia or Exg Ib activities . The lack of a drastic defect on EXG1 - disrupted strains may simply be a reﬂection of the multiplicity of glucan - hydrolyzing enzymes and could mean that the cell might dispense some of them with no signiﬁcant alterations . Although functionally re - dundant proteins do not necessarily have to be encoded by homologous genes , the strong similarity of the EXG2 - encoded exo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase to those encoded by the EXG1 gene would support the notion of the presence of gene products that could serve complementary functions such that the cell would be able to compensate for the absence of one of them . The behavior of doubly disrupted strains ( exg1 exg2 ) clearly rules out such pos - sibility , although one cannot totally rule out the possibility of a functional complementation since these mutants still retain exo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase activity , probably because of a minor , as yet unidentiﬁed , form ( 94 , 379 ) . Because of their mechanism of action on the substrate , it is also conceivable that endoglucanases are the enzymes relevant for the growth and development of cells and that exoglu - canases are only accessory or even dispensable . The reduced body of evidence available for S . cerevisiae and other yeast species suggests that exoglucanases are not able to hydrolyze isolated yeast walls or wall glucans ( 144 , 193 ) . By contrast , some endoglucanases completely solubilize or lyse isolated walls ( 145 , 357 , 438 ) , and this ﬁnding implies the presence of certain linkages accessible only to endoglucanase cleavage that are critical for the maintenance of wall integrity . The hydrolytic mode of action exhibited by the BGL2 - encoded product , to - gether with its lectin - like binding capacity to yeast 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glu - can , makes this glucanase a good candidate for playing such a crucial role in cell morphogenesis . BGL2 disruption , however , does not result in a phenotype under laboratory conditions , and mating and sporulation are not affected ; only gp29 over - producers , by transformation with a high - copy - number plas - 360 CID ET AL .

Therefore , the function of the gp29 endo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase in null mutants seems to be compensated , while larger amounts of the protein within the cell are at least in - hibitory for growth ( 304 ) . Conﬁnement of SSG1 gene expression to sporulation , to - gether with its timing of production in the ordered sequence of events which constitutes the meiotic process in S . cerevisiae , is suggestive of a direct participation of the encoded 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glu - canase in morphogenetic events related to ascospore wall de - velopment . Because sporulation in S . cerevisiae can occur on potassium acetate alone , it seems that extensive recycling of the parent cell wall components is required to provide precur - sors for the synthesis of spore macromolecules , and since the appearance of the sporulation - speciﬁc exo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase oc - curs largely before the majority of ascospores have actually formed , it may well have a metabolic function directed toward the mobilization and organization of vegetative cell wall 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan into ascospore walls . Thin - section electron micros - copy of asci in S . cerevisiae , however , does not suggest that the parent wall itself is extensively reutilized ( 153 ) , and recycling is probably restricted to cellular contents ( 199 , 221 ) . A more direct involvement of the SSG1 - encoded product in the con - struction of the ascospore cell wall should then be considered . Despite this , whatever its physiological function , it is clear that SSG1 is not essential for successful completion of sporulation , and homozygous ssg1 / ssg1 diploids undergo meiosis and give rise to four apparently normal , viable ascospores ( 308 , 379 ) . This is not surprising if one takes into account that previous mutational analyses of several other genes that display a late sporulation - speciﬁc expression pattern in most cases failed to reveal dramatic effects on spore formation . Thus , with the exception of the SPS1 gene , whose disruption has been shown to give rise to an asporogenous phenotype ( 343 ) , nonessential functions have been attributed to the products encoded by several late genes such as SGA1 ( 451 ) , SPS2 ( 343 ) , SPS4 ( 160 ) , LGN2 ( 170 ) , SPR2 , SPR6 , and SPR9 ( 220 , 224 ) . A search for a more subtle defect , however , shows differ - ences between the mutant and wild - type strains , pointing to the possibility that the SSG1 - encoded 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase serves some important but not indispensable function in the formation of ascospores . Thus , analysis of the time course of ascus forma - tion reveals a delay in the appearance of asci in the SSG1 - disrupted strain such that after 16 h in sporulation medium , about half of the wild - type diploid cells have been converted into asci whereas only one - quarter of the homozygous mutant population have sporulated ; these differences are reduced by longer incubation periods , reaching almost similar percentages at 37 h , when ascus formation is nearly completed ( 379 ) . Com - plementary results were obtained on testing the capacity of ascospores derived from SPR1 - disrupted diploids to survive heat stress : mutant spores lose viability at 42 (cid:56) C much more rapidly than do similarly treated wild - type spores ( 308 ) . This phenomenon seems most likely to be attributable to a delay in spore wall maturation , because the increased killing rate is observed in spores only from newly formed asci ( up to 20 h in sporulation medium ) and not in mature ( 24 h or older ) asci . The observation that wild - type and mutant spores obtained by sporulation of a heterozygous ( SPR1 / spr1 ) diploid strain were killed at equal rates at 42 (cid:56) C ( 308 ) suggests that the sporulation exo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase functions before partitioning of nuclei or is distributed to developing ascospores prior to the completion of prospore walls . On the basis of the signiﬁcant degree of similarity between the SSG1 - encoded product and the 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanases encoded by the EXG1 and EXG2 genes , the possibility that the lack of a phenotype severely defective in spore formation in SSG1 - disrupted strains is the result of overlapping activities by veg - etative 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanases is really attractive . Functional redun - dancy has also been invoked to explain why mature spores from homozygous SPS100 - disrupted diploids are as resistant to ether as are wild - type controls , despite there being a signiﬁcant delay in the onset of ether resistance in developing mutant asci , and also to account for the failure to readily detect a mutant phenotype for other sporulation - speciﬁc genes such as SPS2 , SPS4 , and SPS101 ( 160 , 249 , 342 ) . The sporulation efﬁciencies of doubly and triply disrupted strains clearly show that this is not the case ( 379 ) , although one cannot totally rule out the possibility of a functional complementation . Thus , the fact that the triple mutant still retains most of the glucan - degradative capacity exhibited by the singly SSG1 - disrupted mutant points to both the small contribution of the EXG1 - and EXG2 - en - coded products to the total 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase content during sporulation and , even more interestingly , the presence during this process of other 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan - hydrolyzing enzymes . At present , it is not possible to elucidate which enzymatic forms might be responsible for these levels of 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase activ - ity . On one hand , it should be taken into account that as mentioned above , apart from the EXG1 - and EXG2 - encoded 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanases , other minor exo - and endo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanases have been described as occurring during vegetative growth ( 72 ) and their synthesis could be maintained or even activated dur - ing the meiotic program . Alternatively , some enzymatic form with exo - or endo - 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase activity might exist , whose induction , like that of the SSG1 - encoded product , is speciﬁ - cally coupled to sporulation events . To conclude , it seems clear that unravelling of the biological function of each of the components of such a complex system demands a deeper study of their in vivo action through a systematic search for discernible phenotypes ; this could lead , in some cases , to modifying former concepts created on the basis of in vitro analyses of alternative substrates with well - deﬁned structures ( such as laminarin or pustulan ) . As an ex - ample , the recent ﬁnding that overexpression of EXG1 from a 2 (cid:109) m plasmid leads to a cell wall 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan reduction and causes killer resistance in wild - type cells while EXG1 deletion results in slight increases in killer sensitivity and 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan levels ( 214 ) is a good indication that the most prevalent in vitro activity of these enzymes ( 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucanase ) on a model sub - strate may not be a reﬂection of their mechanism of action on the native polymers . Two possible , not mutually exclusive , ex - planations have been invoked to explain these observations ( 214 ) . Exo - (cid:98) - glucanases hydrolyze glucan polymers from the nonreducing end , so that the EXG1 - encoded Exg Ia and Exg Ib activities would preferentially break down the smaller and highly branched 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan over the long linear 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan . Alternatively , it could be speculated that these enzymes would function speciﬁcally as 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucanases on the in vivo cell wall glucans . Whatever the mechanism , demonstration that changes in Exg Ia and Exg Ib activity lead to detectable in vivo alter - ations in the cell wall provides the ﬁrst experimental support for the expectation that EXG1 - encoded glucanases play a func - tional role in cell wall glucan metabolism . Chitinase As described above , chitin is quantitatively a very minor wall component , although its speciﬁc deposition in the region of the septum is important for the mechanical stability of this tem - porary junction between mother and daughter cells . Degrada - tion of this chitinous septum seems imperative to allow the daughter cell to begin an independent existence , but , in con - V OL . 59 , 1995 CELL INTEGRITY AND MORPHOGENESIS IN S .

Cloning of the gene for this enzyme , CTS1 , was achieved by plasmid - based overexpression ( 246 ) . The reported sequence predicts a 562 - amino - acid protein with four clearly distinct domains : a signal peptide , a catalytic domain , a serine / threo - nine - rich region , and a carboxy - terminal domain with high binding afﬁnity for chitin ( 247 ) . Although the majority of chitinase activity produced in yeast cultures ( 90 % ) is secreted into the growth medium , most of the cell - associated chitinase activity remains sequestered in the cell wall ( 60 % ) . That portion of the enzyme that becomes associ - ated with the cell wall apparently functions in cell separation , since CTS1 disruption results in a clear inability of cells to separate normally . This block in cell separation is manifest in large aggregates of cells attached by their cell septum regions . Deletion of the C - terminal chitin - binding domain from a CTS1 plasmid results in a decreased ability of the gene to comple - ment the separation - defective phenotype of a CTS1 disruption . These data suggest that the chitin - binding region functions in localizing the enzyme to the cell wall , where it hydrolyzes chitin ﬁbers which join mother and daughter cells ( 247 ) . A clumpy phenotype similar to that observed in chitinase - deﬁcient mutants is observed in strains harboring an ace2 mu - tation , in which CTS1 mRNA levels are drastically reduced . The ACE2 gene is homologous to the SWI5 gene , which en - codes a zinc ﬁnger protein that functions as a cell cycle acti - vator of the HO endonuclease gene transcription to initiate mating - type interconversion ; the zinc ﬁnger DNA - binding do - mains of these two proteins are very highly conserved , with 85 % identity in amino acid sequence ( 54 , 409 ) . Transcriptional studies on synchronous cells indicate that CTS1 is expressed throughout the cell cycle with a periodicity of RNA accumu - lation similar to that of the HO gene ( 118 ) . Maximal expression from these two genes occurs slightly before that of histone H2A , a marker of the interval between late G 1 phase and early S phase of the cell cycle . ACE2 displays a pattern of cell cycle - regulated transcription ( expression in the G 2 phase ) and subcellular localization iden - tical to that seen for SWI5 , although , despite their similarities , SWI5 and ACE2 function in separate pathways of transcrip - tional regulation . SWI5 is a transcriptional activator of the HO endonuclease gene , whereas ACE2 is not . By contrast , ACE2 is a transcriptional activator of the CTS1 gene , whereas SWI5 is not . Overproduction of either SWI5 or ACE2 , however , allows transcriptional activation of the target gene from the other pathway , suggesting that Ace2p and Swi5p both recognize the same DNA sequence . The fact that the HO gene is expressed in only one of the two cells produced from mitotic division and the many analogies between the SWI5 / HO and ACE2 / CTS1 regulatory pathways , have led to the interesting suggestion that the CTS1 gene , like HO , will be asymmetrically expressed in mothers and daughters , such that chitinase would be synthe - sized in only one of the progeny from cell division . The asym - metry of the bud scar is consistent with this notion ( 118 ) . Mannanases Although mannan is a major wall component and it has been shown by pulse - chase experiments that at least a portion of the mannoprotein pool is subject to degradative turnover ( 339 ) , there is only limited information on the system responsible for the breakdown of mannose - containing biopolymers from yeast cells . On the basis of knowledge of mannoprotein structure and studies with bacterial enzymes ( 16 ) , one might expect exo - mannanase and endo - 1 , 6 - (cid:97) - mannanase to be involved in the hydrolysis of mannan polysaccharide and an endo - (cid:98) - N - acetylglucosaminidase to cleave the connection between poly - saccharide and protein . Several investigators have reported partial puriﬁcation of a nonspeciﬁc (cid:97) - mannosidase from S . cerevisiae that is active to - ward p - nitrophenyl - (cid:97) - mannopyranoside ( 213 , 226 , 332 ) . This activity has been reported to be a component of the vacuolar membrane and has been cataloged as a marker enzyme for this organelle ( 432 ) . (cid:97) - Mannosidase levels are apparently con - trolled by catabolite repression , since the enzyme concentra - tion varies inversely with the growth rate , and have been shown to increase signiﬁcantly in sporulating diploids until ascospores are completely formed ( 332 ) . The putative structural gene for this (cid:97) - mannosidase ( AMS1 ) was cloned by plasmid - based overexpression ( 246 ) and was found to encode a 1 , 083 - amino - acid polypeptide with a calcu - lated molecular mass of 107 kDa , containing seven potential N - glycosylation sites ( 458 ) . No readily apparent phenotype is associated with (cid:97) - mannosidase deﬁciency in vegetatively grow - ing AMS1 - disrupted strains , and since homozygous AMS1 null mutants are able to sporulate normally , it appears that this hydrolase is not essential for the meiotic process . Labelling experiments with AMS1 and ams1 haploids and [ 2 - 3 H ] man - nose , however , suggest that the cloned (cid:97) - mannosidase may play a role in glycoprotein metabolism , analogous to that of the corresponding hydrolase in mammalian lysosomes , by cata - lyzing the sequential removal of mannose residues from the nonreducing end of mannan chains ( 246 ) . MORPHOGENETIC PATHWAYS Thus far , we have addressed what is known about the enzy - matic machinery required for cell wall formation during the different stages of the budding - yeast life cycle . Now we shall consider the regulatory pathways that may control the timing and positioning of morphogenetic events at particular points in the cell cycle . As described above , certain cell wall biosynthetic enzymes are required only during a particular stage of the life cycle ( Fig . 3 ) . Very little is known about the transcrip - tional and / or posttranslational controls that lead to accumu - lation or activation of these enzymes at the proper stage or how such regulatory systems become activated by environmen - tal changes , such as nitrogen starvation , the presence of mating pheromones , or intracellular signals from cell cycle control genes . Furthermore , there is an additional complication , namely , the requirement for an accurate polarization of cell wall com - ponents and enzymes to a discrete point under the cell surface . Secretion pathways , involving cytoskeletal proteins , have been shown to play a key role in polarized growth in yeasts . The signals for controlling such polarization are a matter of interest for many researchers , whose efforts have revealed an array of genes involved in these controls ( 74 , 78 , 277 ) and have pro - vided important clues for our understanding of these pro - cesses , although the mechanism of polarization is still not well understood . Connecting the Mitotic Cycle to Morphogenesis Morphogenetic events during the S . cerevisiae cell cycle may be classiﬁed into four main levels : ( i ) bud site selection , which occurs in the G 1 phase ; ( ii ) bud emergence , which is preceded by the localization of the actin cytoskeletal apparatus and other elements at the preselected point and occurs just after START ; ( iii ) bud growth , which occurs from late G 1 through S and G 2 phases and involves a switch in actin localization from an apical 362 CID ET AL .

R EV . on F eb r ua r y 21 , 2013 b y PE NN S T A T E UN I V h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m to a more diffuse pattern ; and ( iv ) cytokinesis and cell separa - tion , which involve a prior redistribution of the actin cytoskel - eton to the septum area and occur after mitosis . Each of these stages is genetically programmed and synchronized with the nuclear events ( Fig . 4 ) . Synchrony between nuclear and corti - cal events is necessary for successful completion of the cell cycle , but many aspects of bud formation are relatively inde - pendent of those involving nuclear division . As an example , conditional mutations that block budding at early stages of cell cycle ( cdc24 or cdc42 mutations [ see below ] ) still allow nuclear division ( 183 , 216 , 404 ) , although after a considerable delay in G 2 ( 260a ) . Morphogenetic and spindle pole body ( SPB ) duplication processes are probably triggered by a common signal , since both begin simultaneously in late G 1 , at the time of START in the cell cycle ( 350 ) . The protein kinase activity of the CDC28 gene product ( the counterpart of Cdc2 in other eukaryotes ) , when bound to a family of regulatory proteins called cyclins , is known to be crucial for the commitment of cell cycle and entry into mitosis ( 355 , 356 , 449 ) . When Cdc28p is bound to G 1 cyclins ( encoded by the budding yeast CLN genes ) , morpho - genetic events leading to bud emergence and SPB duplication occur . These events run parallel to the expression of proteins required for the entry of cells into the S phase ( 218 ) . A differ - ent set of cyclins— CLB3 , CLB4 , CLB5 , and CLB6 —also present in early stages of the cycle may account for the mod - ulation of the speciﬁc functions of CDC28 in the commitment to the S phase ( 136 , 244 , 311 , 390 ) . The question now arises whether the cytoskeletal rearrangements leading to polarized secretion and bud initiation are also triggered by Cdc28 - medi - ated phosphorylation . During the G 1 phase , a bundle of microtubules emanating from the SPB ( the yeast microtubule - organizing center ) ex - tends toward the future bud site ( 2 , 212 ) . In the submembrane at the incipient bud site , we ﬁnd some intriguing elements : a patch of a nonessential protein that localizes at sites of cell growth ( Spa2p ) ( 405 ) , and a ring of 10 - nm microﬁlaments ( thought to consist of CDC3 , CDC10 , CDC11 , and CDC12 gene products ) which remains at the daughter - mother junction until cytokinesis and is probably responsible for some aspect of FIG . 4 .

Both elements could constitute part of a label system for bud site selection ( 146 ) which is established from the previous cell cycle ( see below ) . Inside the area encircled by this ring , and as well as Spa2p , is located a series of proteins , as detected by immunoﬂuores - cence techniques . These include small GTPases of the Ras superfamily ( Cdc42p , Rho1p , and Sec4 ) ( 321 , 452 , 462 ) , un - conventional myosin ( Myo2p ) ( 264 ) , calmodulin ( Cmd1p ) ( 43 , 413 ) , and the SH3 domain - containing protein Bem1p ( cited in references 78 and 260 ) ( genes related to bud site selection and bud emergence are listed in Table 4 ) . Also in late G 1 , the ‘‘actin - cortical’’ or ‘‘actin - dots’’ cytoskeleton , consisting of F - actin and some actin - binding proteins ( see below ) ( 2 , 227 , 319 ) , is localized at the future bud site . Long cytoplasmic actin ca - bles also appear to point to the incipient bud site ( 2 , 227 ) , where secretory vesicles start to accumulate ( 55 ) . It is likely that START triggers some aspects of this polar - ization process . Using cells synchronized by centrifugal elutria - tion , Lew and Reed ( 259 ) found that prominent actin polar - ization occurs after START , indicating that the phosphorylating activity of Cdc28 / G 1 cyclin is important for actin distribution at the future bud site , although it is likely that the site had already been chosen by the cell earlier in G 1 ( 278 ) . Our current view is that the mechanisms for bud site selection depend on signals laid at the poles by remnants from the previous cell cycle acting as tags ( see the section below ) ( 74 , 278 ) ; the START signal then triggers actin polymerization and secretion toward the preselected point in late G 1 ( see Fig . 8 ) . A strong link between G 1 cyclins and bud emergence was recently identiﬁed when the Cross and Nasmyth teams simul - taneously found that a bud site selection gene , BUD2 ( see below ) , is necessary for budding only in cln1 cln2 mutant back - grounds ( 28 , 101 ) . This suggests that Cln1p and Cln2p would be involved in the control of morphogenetic events . In the earlier stages of bud emergence , actin , Spa2p , Rho proteins , calmodulin , and secretory vesicles localize at the tip of the growing bud ( 2 , 43 , 405 , 413 , 452 , 462 ) . However , as the bud enlarges , the actin spots reduce their accumulation at the bud tip , scattering more diffusely around the bud ( 2 , 278 ) and most of the aforementioned products are no longer conspicu - ous at the bud polar end , with the exception of Spa2p and Rho1p , which remain longer ( 43 , 405 , 452 , 462 ) . Growth re - mains active until the bud reaches its ﬁnal size before mitosis . At this point , all these different components are either not visible or dispersed throughout the bud . After mitosis , cell wall synthesis is required again , this time to culminate the cycle in cell separation . At the time of cytokinesis , Spa2p , calmodulin , and actin redistribute to the septum zone , inside the area encircled by the outer chitin ring ( 43 , 227 , 405 , 413 ) . Depolarization of the actin cortical cytoskeleton at the bud tip coincides with the activation of the Cdc28 kinase by a different family of cyclins , which are encoded by the CLB1 and CLB2 genes ( 165 , 414 ) . When activated by the Clb proteins , the Cdc28 kinase constitutes the yeast equivalent of matura - tion - promoting factor , which is found in higher eukaryotes and is responsible for the commitment of the nuclear changes that lead to chromosome segregation . Lew and Reed ( 259 ) also demonstrated that activation of the Cdc28 / Cln1 , 2 complex is linked to the depolarization of actin at the bud tip , reporting that a lack of its activity resulted in hyperpolarized secretion leading to elongated buds . They also stated that overproduc - tion of these cyclins accelerates the depolarization of actin in the daughter cell . These authors call this cycle - regulated de - polarization the apical / isotropic switch ( 260 ) , because it pro - motes a shift from the initial apical growth to an isodiametric enlargement of the bud . Finally , inactivation of Cdc28p after mitosis is important for relocalization of the actin cytoskeleton to the septum area TABLE 4 .

These observations suggest that the CLB1 - and CLB2 - encoded cyclins negatively regulate the ability of Cdc28p to activate the pathways that lead to polarized actin assembly . To summarize , Cdc28p plays a key role in integrating nuclear and cytoplasmic cytoskeletal rearrangements throughout the cycle . We still do not know the phosphorylation targets of the Cdc28 / Cln complex and it is likely , as discussed below , that the path - way to morphogenesis at the cortical level is much more com - plicated than simply direct phosphorylation by Cdc28 and that it probably involves other components such as second messen - gers and / or complex signal transduction pathways . Selection of Sites of Polarized Cell Growth Budding . An interesting aspect of cell biology is how sites of cell division are chosen . S . cerevisiae cells bud at deﬁned sites on the cell surface . It was classically accepted that the site for a new bud is determined by the mating locus of the cell ( MAT ) ( see reference 191 for a review ) and by whether the cell was a mother or a daughter in the previous mitotic cycle . Haploid cells , either a or (cid:97) , develop a new bud just adjacent to their previous budding site . This is termed an axial budding pattern . Diploids , in contrast , follow a bipolar pattern : a / (cid:97) daughter cells bud at the tip of the pole opposite from their birth site ( a distal pattern ) , although they can occasionally bud at the prox - imal pole as well ( around or inside their birth site ) ; mother a / (cid:97) cells form a second bud at either pole ( 77a ) , although there is an initial preference for axial sites in new mothers ( 277 ) . This behavior is under the control of the mating - type locus , since diploid a / a or (cid:97) / (cid:97) cells choose the axial pattern . The axial pattern has been suggested to position haploid cells close to one another for mating in wild - type homothallic strains , which can switch mating types . Diploid cells would grow distally for a more efﬁcient colonization of the surrounding environment ( 166 , 277 ) . As mentioned before , the selection of bud sites takes place in the G 1 phase after cell separation . In haploid cells , as de - scribed by Snyder et al . ( 406 ) , a new Spa2p patch appears adjacent to the bud scar left from the previous cycle and the nucleus seems to rotate almost 180 (cid:56) until the SPB faces this new patch . A bundle of microtubules that connects the SPB with the selected point at the surface can often be detected by immunoﬂuorescence staining . Presumably , there is a structure at the bud site that would be responsible for microtubule capture and nuclear rotation . In diploid cells , if the chosen pattern is distal , the Spa2p patch will appear in front of the SPB , which , after cytokinesis , stays just opposite the latest bud site ( 406 ) . Hence , no nuclear rotation is required in distal budding . Considering this scheme , the control of cell polarity would be centered in the SPB movements toward the putative bud site in the membrane , marked by Spa2p and other pro - teins . However , more recent evidence provided by Chant and Pringle ( 77a ) suggests that the determinants for bud site se - lection are linked to the cell surface acting as transient ( in the axial pattern ) or permanent ( in bipolar budding ) marker sig - nals . A sensible theory is that the poles of an ellipsoidal yeast cell would be permanently marked by remnants from prefer - ential growth at those points ( 74 , 77a ) , thus explaining the basic bipolar pattern . This theory is consistent with the obser - vation that mutations in some proteins related to the assembly of the actin cortical cytoskeleton at growth sites—Rvs167p , proﬁlin , some actin mutants , Bem2p ( see below ) —cause ran - dom budding ( 23 , 124 , 174 , 229 ) . In the axial pattern , some component left from ( or associated with ) the 10 - nm microﬁla - ments ring could act as a membrane signal for the next bud location , since such a component might remain at the previous bud site after cytokinesis . When that mark is absent , the distal pattern is favored ( 146 , 278 , 406 ) . Such a mark , in contrast to the bipolar determinants , is lost after starvation and refeeding ( 77a ) , and so its effectiveness is transitory . As deduced by recent studies , Bud3p is a good candidate for acting as the axial mark ( 74 , 77 ) ( see below ) . The search for mutants with altered haploid budding pat - terns has identiﬁed ﬁve BUD genes ( 75 , 76 ) . This set of genes also accounts for the use of one pattern or the other . Muta - tions in BUD1 , BUD2 , and BUD5 in haploid strains cause a random budding pattern , whereas bud3 and bud4 mutations lead to a bipolar pattern . When tested in diploid a / (cid:97) strains , bud1 , bud2 , and bud5 show random cell polarity while bud3 and bud4 do not exhibit an altered pattern . These facts strongly suggest that BUD1 , BUD2 , and BUD5 are required for all sites . BUD3 and BUD4 are speciﬁcally required for the selection of axial sites in haploid cells . There are presumably components which are expressed only in a cells and (cid:97) cells which are responsible for helping the selection of axial sites as well . The SPA2 gene and the ones encoding the components of the 10 - nm microﬁlaments ring are also essential for cell polarity , since their disruption also causes alterations in the budding pattern ( 146 , 405 ) . Interestingly , it has been recently reported that Bud3p colocalizes with such components , Cdc3p , Cdc10p , Cdc11p , and Cdc12p , in the area of the ring - like structure that encircles the mother bud neck ( 74 , 77 ) . Bud3p seems to local - ize to the preassembled neck ﬁlaments precisely at the time of the initiation of mitosis and remain there well after cytokinesis ( 77 ) , probably accounting for the transient signal that regulates axial budding . A search for mutants speciﬁcally affected in the bipolar budding pattern has been carried out by the team led by J . Pringle ( 349a ) , yielding spa2 , novel alleles of bud2 and bud5 , and a set of four new mutants which will probably shed new light on the control of polarization in the following years . Among them , bud6 and bud7 mutations cause a random pat - tern whereas , interestingly , bud8 mutants bud exclusively at the proximal pole and bud9 mutants bud only at the distal pole ( 349a ) . This means that each pole may have its speciﬁc markers for budding . BUD1 , also called RSR1 , encodes a protein homologous to known Ras proteins which are GTP - binding proteins ( 24 , 76 ) . GTP - bound Rsr1p / Bud1p is considered the key element for bud site selection at the poles . Rsr1p is regulated by Bud5p , which is homologous to Cdc25p , Scd25p , and Lte1p ( 75 ) , a family of proteins which are thought to exchange GDP for GTP ( known as GEF for GDP - GTP exchange factors ) , leading to the activation of Ras . BUD2 encodes a GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) that probably modulates the activation of BUD1 / RSR1 in vivo ( 338 ) ( see the GTPase cycle in Fig . 5 ) . Other Ras - like GTPase / GEF / GAP cycles ( like the Rsr1p - Bud5p - Bud2p one ) are known to exist along the secretory pathway ( Ypt1p , Sec4p ) ( 126 ) and in morphogenetic regula - tory pathways ( see below ) in S . cerevisiae . More recently , a novel gene involved in the development of the axial pattern has been reported and named AXL1 ( 156 ) . Remarkably , the Axl1p sequence shows homology to human insulin - degrading proteases . The fact that it is essential for the axial haploid pattern and the observation that its expression is repressed in a / (cid:97) diploids make it a new and fundamental ele - ment for our understanding of the regulation of polarity . A putative target of this protease , Rax1p , has been cloned ( cited in reference 156 ) . Further characterization of both the func - tion of Rax1p and the precise biological role of Bud1p / Rsr1p will help us to eventually understand the molecular controls of cell polarity .

The PFY1 , RVS167 , CDC24 , and BEM2 genes have also been reported to be essential for proper bud site selection ( 23 , 174 , 229 , 404 ) . PFY1 codes for proﬁlin , an actin monomer seques - tering protein ( 174 ) . RVS167 encodes another putative actin - binding protein ( 23 ) . Some loci functionally related to RVS167 also show a random pattern of budding ( 131 ) . It is sensible to theorize that the random budding defect observed in some of these mutants related to actin functions is simply due to a loss of the permanent signal that marks the poles of the cell , on which bipolar budding replies . Cdc24p and Bem2p ( see below ) are part of a complex set of regulators which are probable candidates for acting downstream from Bud1p / Rsr1p—or con - currently with it—to direct the localization of actin to the bud site , and their dysfunction prevents bud emergence ( 25 , 229 , 404 , 460 ) . Some act1 mutant alleles and a hemizygote ACT1 / act1 : : LEU2 diploid also show bud site selection defects ( 124 ) . Such an observation implies that actin itself must play a role , at least indirectly , in bud site selection . The effect of these mutations in bud site selection overlaps this process with the essential morphogenetic regulation pathways , making it difﬁ - cult to establish a differentiation between mechanisms for the selection of polarity and mechanisms for the control of mor - phogenesis . This points to the existence of a strong interde - pendence between both processes . In summary , analysis of the different mutants affecting bud - ding patterns indicates that there are three different types of components that participate in bud site selection ( 146 ) . There are components which mark the site of bud formation ( i . e . , tag components , such as the neck ﬁlament proteins , Bud3p , Bud4p , and perhaps Rax1p ) ; there are molecules that are pre - sumably involved in targeting components to the bud site ( such as Bud1p , Bud2p , and Bud5p ) ; and , ﬁnally , there are molecules which are targeted to the incipient bud site and assemble at that site ( such as Spa2p , Cdc42p , Pfy1p , and actin ) . Mutations in components which mark the axial bud site lead to selection of other sites ( e . g . , bipolar sites ) , whereas mutations in target - ing , early assembly , or permanent polar components can lead to the selection of random sites . Mating projection . Growth of the shmoo projection in the presence of the opposite mating - type pheromone is also po - larized ( 278 ) . In this case , cell growth is polarized toward the source of the pheromone , so that the projection of each mating cell grows in the direction of its partner in order to facilitate cell fusion . The pheromone receptor at the cell surface , Ste2p ( a cells ) or Ste3p ( (cid:97) cells ) , should constitute the tag for cell wall deposition ( 430 ) . Indeed , the pheromone receptor is known to accumulate at the tip of the shmoo ( 211 ) and is responsible for a cascade of events that include cell cycle ar - rest , a positive feedback pathway for the appearance of more receptors at the membrane , and polarized secretion of the pheromone . The fact that spa2 mutants mate poorly and can - not form projections properly ( 162 ) strongly suggests that Spa2p , present at the projection tip , is also a component of the growth polarization machinery in the shmoo . When (cid:97) - factor is uniformly distributed around MAT a cells , the mating projec - tion emerges adjacent to the bud scar , and this ‘‘axial’’ pattern is altered in bud mutants ( 278 ) . This observation implies that some of the same components are probably shared in bud and mating projection site selection and emergence . Consistent with this , at least Cdc24p , Cdc42p , and Bem1p are observed in growth regions at both the bud and the shmoo projection , and cdc24 , bem1 , and spa2 mutations have been isolated in a screening for mutants unable to mate with enfeebled partners ( 78 , 80 ) . In fact , a situation similar to bud emergence is ob - served in a developing shmoo . Secretory vesicles , actin , and calmodulin accumulate at the growth region , and the SPB with emanating microtubules faces the projection . As might happen during bud growth , polarized secretion of synthetic and hydro - lytic cell wall enzymes to the shmoo tip is expected to be crucial for the process of projection development and cell fusion dur - ing sexual conjugation . It is interesting to speculate that the same or very similar components mediate the process of po - larized secretion of cell wall components and the temporal activation of cell wall synthetic or hydrolytic enzymes in both budding and mating . This would explain the apparent lack of glucan and chitin synthases and hydrolases speciﬁcally involved in mating ( Fig . 3 ) . Septins and Morphogenesis The putative components of the neck ring of 10 - nm ﬁla - ments , Cdc3p , Cdc10p , Cdc11p , and Cdc12p , belong to a fam - ily of proteins that ﬁnds homologs in C . albicans , Drosophila melanogaster , mice , and human cells ( 117 , 310 , 315 ) , and they have recently been designated septins ( 378 ) . These proteins show an important degree of similarity , suggesting that they may perform a well - conserved function . Mutations in any of these homolog genes in S . cerevisiae cause a similar thermo - sensitive phenotype , suggesting that all these genes contribute to the assembly of the ring structure in an interdependent way ( 152 , 173 , 182 , 228 ) . Their sequences reveal a putative nucle - otide - binding site ( 146 ) that may account for the regulation of their assembly . Mutants with mutations in these genes were initially isolated as defective in cytokinesis ( 182 ) , but a growing body of evidence points to a broader role for the septins in morphogenetic control through the different stages of the cell cycle . First , septins may play a role in bud site selection mecha - nisms , as suggested by the following observations : ( i ) Bud3p , a tag for axial budding as discussed above , colocalizes with these proteins ( 74 , 77 ) ; ( ii ) haploid strains with mutant septins often bud at distal sites ( 146 ) ; and ( iii ) although the SPA2 gene only seems to be essential for bud site selection and mating , spa2 and cdc10 mutations cause synthetic lethality ( 146 ) . Second , septins may mediate in the transduction of cell cycle Clb - dependent signals for the apical / isotropic switch , since the most characteristic phenotype of cdc3 , cdc10 , cdc11 , and cdc12 mutations is the appearance of extremely elongated buds , re - sulting from an apical hyperpolarization of actin ( 2 ) . The same phenomenon is observable when CLB1 and CLB2 genes are deleted ( 259 ) . Third , septins are assumed to play a role in cytokinesis , since ( i ) lack of their function causes a defect in cytokinesis and cell separation ( 182 ) ; ( ii ) their location around the septum area ( 152 , 173 , 228 ) suggests this possibility ; and ( iii ) septin mutants give rise to abnormal ectopic septa ( 87 , 403 ) , meaning that disassembly of the ring leads to delocalization of the septum initiation process . Fourth , septins may also control morphogenesis during shmoo formation , because Afr1p , which is involved in promot - ing apical growth in the shmoo , physically interacts with Cdc12p at the base of the mating projection . Additionally , the ectopic expression of the AFR1 gene in the mitotic cycle causes a bud elongation defect like that of the septin mutations ( 236 ) . These observations harmonize with the hypothesis that the cell cycle arrest caused by the presence of mating pheromone pro - motes a loosening of the tightly bound ring structure , thus disfavoring the formation of the neck constriction necessary for budding and therefore promoting shmoo formation . 366 CID ET AL .

R EV . on F eb r ua r y 21 , 2013 b y PE NN S T A T E UN I V h tt p : / / mm b r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Fifth , septins may control the localized synthesis of the bulk of chitin by CSIII throughout the life cycle of budding yeast , since ( i ) loss of the 10 - nm ﬁlament ring in all cdc3 , cdc10 , cdc11 , and cdc12 mutants is concomitant with the loss of the chitin ring that stands above it in the cell wall ( 362 , 403 ) ; ( ii ) assembly of the neck ring occurs prior to bud emergence at the precise spot where chitin must be laid down ( 152 , 173 , 228 ) ; ( iii ) a cdc10 allele , isolated in a search for thermosensitive lytic mutants , confers a less protective cell wall even at permissive temperatures ( 87 ) ; and ( iv ) at permissive temperatures , the same cdc10 mutant forms bumpy budding scars reminiscent of those observed in chs3 mutants ( see above ) ( 87 ) . In light of this record , it is tempting to speculate that the assembly of the neck ﬁlaments at the bud site may be directly or indirectly controlled by the Cdc28 kinase and that it consti - tutes a basic element for the control of many different mor - phogenetic events that govern the whole process of budding and is an interesting link between spatial chitin synthesis and cell cycle controls . The ﬁnding of other elements that interact with the septins would provide further insights into their func - tion and regulation . Actin Cytoskeleton : Its Role in Polarized Secretion Actin has been shown to be essential for morphogenesis , and it also participates in other aspects of cell division , such as mitochondrial segregation and endocytosis ( 124 , 243 ) . As men - tioned above , cell wall growth—whether in the bud site in late G 1 , in the growing bud during S and G 2 phases , in the septum after mitosis , or at the shmoo tip during exposure to mating pheromone—is always accompanied by the underlying actin cortical cytoskeleton , consisting of actin patches that are easily detectable by staining ﬁxed cells with ﬂuorochrome - conjugated phalloidin . An interesting hypothesis , based on immunoelec - tron microscopy studies , has been advanced by Mulholland et al . to explain the ultrastructure of these patches ( 306 ) . These authors have reported evidence that cortical actin and colocal - izing proteins are distributed around thin invaginations of the plasma membrane at the sites of growth , and they propose a model in which the bottom of such invaginations is connected to actin cables . The best - characterized genes related to these structures are listed in Table 5 . ACT1 is the only gene encoding actin in budding yeasts ( 319 ) , although actin - related protein genes , ACT2 and ACT3 , both essential , and the centractin - encoding ACT5 have also been identiﬁed ( 89 , 179 , 305 , 389 ) . Act1p shares almost 90 % sequence identity with known mammalian actins , while the other actins are more divergent . Act1p is the prevalent actin , responsible for the bulk of the cytoskeleton , and is one of the major cytoplasmic proteins in the yeast cell . Actin monomers aggregate into ﬁlaments , which constitute a basic part of cer - tain cytoskeletal structures , such as the cytoplasmic cables and subcortical dots . Act2p ( also known as Arp2 , for actin - related protein ) is much less abundant , and since its disruption leads to cells arrested with a large bud , like cdc mutations acting late in the cell cycle , it is thought to be involved in essential cytoskel - etal rearrangements after mitosis . Interestingly , Act2p / Arp2p has the unique feature of carrying a consensus motif for phos - phorylation by the Cdc28 / cyclin complex ( 389 ) . If in the future it is demonstrated that such phosphorylation really exists , this would be the ﬁrst description of a direct regulatory role of Cdc28 in the temporal control of cytoskeletal events . Strong evidence that actin is involved in different morpho - genetic stages comes from analysis of phenotypes of act1 tem - perature - sensitive mutants ( 319 ) . act1 mutants are often het - erogeneous in size , and many large cells which contain small buds are observed . These are assumed to have arisen by po - larity defects in which the mother cell grows preferentially at the expense of the bud . Other actin mutants , in which cells have elongated buds , are bumpy or multibudded , or have de - fects in bud site selection , have also been found ( 124 ) . act1 TABLE 5 .

These different defects are consistent with a role for actin in the polarized secretion of growth components in yeast cells . A number of actin - binding proteins , including actin ﬁlament bundling proteins ( Sac6p , Tpm1p , Tpm2p ) ( 3 , 122 , 270 ) , cap - ping proteins ( Cap1p , Cap2p ) ( 7 ) , monomer - sequestering pro - teins ( Pfy1p ) ( 174 ) , severing proteins ( Cof1p ) ( 207 , 303 ) , and motor proteins ( Myo1p , Myo2p , Myo4p ) ( 175 , 217 , 366 ) have been identiﬁed in S . cerevisiae . Since the actin cortical cytoskel - eton is always associated with areas of cell wall growth , we shall now consider the roles of these proteins in polarized secretion . Some of the genes encoding putative actin - binding proteins have been cloned as suppressors of act1 mutations ( SAC1 to SAC7 ) ( 3 , 127 , 320 ) . Sac6p is the yeast homolog of mammalian ﬁmbrin , and it colocalizes with both the actin cytoplasmic ca - bles and actin dots , presumably stabilizing actin ﬁlaments ( 3 , 123 ) . Unexpectedly , null mutations in SAC6 do not seem to affect viability . Another nonessential protein located at the cortical actin spots is Abp1p ( for actin - binding protein ) , whose sequence contains domains reminiscent of those found in co - ﬁlin , a proline - rich motif , and an SH3 ( Src homology 3 ) do - main , which is characteristic of proteins involved in signal transduction pathways at the level of the cortical cytoskeleton ( 123 , 125 ) . Synthetic lethal mutations with abp1 have been sought , yielding sac6 and mutations in two novel genes , SLA1 and SLA2 ( 196 ) . SLA2 shows some similarity to mammalian talin genes and is indispensable for proper morphogenesis . Death is observed in sla2 sac6 double mutants ( 196 ) . The same gene was isolated by a different strategy and shown to be important for the accumulation of H (cid:49) - ATPase at the plasma membrane ( 309 ) . SLA1 is essential for the assembly of the cortical cytoskeleton and , like Abp1p , carries SH3 domains in its sequence ( 196 ) . SH3 motifs are assumed to bind proline - rich regions , thus promoting protein - protein interactions that are important for the control of the actin cytoskeleton assem - bly in response to signalling pathways . A novel protein , ver - prolin , encoded by VRP1 , has recently been described ( 119 ) . Its main feature is the abnormally high proportion of proline found in its sequence ( 24 % ) . VRP1 ( for very rich in proline ) disruption leads to actin cortical cytoskeleton delocalization and aberrant cell shape ( 119 ) , and hence this protein would be expected to interact with some of the SH3 - containing proteins involved in morphogenetic control , such as Sla1p , Abp1p , or Bem1p . Actin - capping proteins are also present under the cell sur - face growing areas ( 6 ) . CAP1 encodes for the a subunit of the yeast capping protein , while the subunit is encoded by CAP2 ( 5 , 7 ) . An altered actin cytoskeleton is observed when any or both genes are disrupted , although secretion is still polarized . Mutations in the actin - capping genes are also synthetic lethal with sac6 ( 4 ) , as are mutations in two other genes , named SLC1 and SLC2 ( 225 ) , which indeed were isolated in a screen for synthetic lethality with cap2 mutants . The slc2 mutation itself is also synthetic lethal with sac6 ( 225 ) . All these facts imply that the combined activity of ﬁmbrin with talin - like , capping , and other actin - binding proteins would contribute to the integrity of the actin cortical cytoskeleton . Also colocalized with actin in regions of active cell wall growth is the COF1 gene product , a homolog of the mamma - lian actin - severing protein , coﬁlin ( 207 , 303 ) . The yeast coﬁlin gene , unlike yeast ﬁmbrin and talin - like protein , is essential . Another ubiquitous actin - binding protein is proﬁlin , an actin monomer - sequestering protein presumably involved in cortical cytoskeleton assembly . Yeast proﬁlin is encoded by PFY1 , a gene whose absence has a dramatic effect on cell growth and chitin distribution ( 174 , 282 , 283 ) . The binding of proﬁlin to actin is antagonized by phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - biphosphate , suggesting that changes in membrane phospholipids may be an important regulatory pathway leading to subcortical actin po - lymerization ( 275 ) . Supporting this hypothesis , Cap2 function is inhibited by phosphatidylinositides ( 6 ) and mammalian co - ﬁlin has also been reported to bind phospholipids ( 455 ) . It is likely that proﬁlin , and perhaps coﬁlin and the capping protein , could have a role in regulating actin polymerization in re - sponse to changes in membrane phospholipids . Additional evidence pointing to the inﬂuence of inositol glycerophospho - lipids on the actin cytoskeleton comes from one of the afore - mentioned actin suppressors , SAC1 , which does not encode an actin - binding protein , as expected , but , rather , encodes a Golgi membrane protein presumably involved in phosphatidylinosi - tol metabolism ( 90 , 448 ) . Further studies must be carried out to assess the role that each protein plays in these interactions . A gene involved in the endocytic process , END3 , has also been reported to be essential for actin polarization . The en - coded protein contains consensus sequences for the binding of Ca 2 (cid:49) and phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - biphosphate ( 27 ) . Actin and ﬁmbrin themselves are important for vesicle internalization during endocytosis in yeast ( 243 ) . Since disruption of the END3 gene also affects both actin distribution and chitin dep - osition ( 27 ) , this gene may have a function in polarized growth . A screen for mutations that preclude complementation of a thermosensitive act1 allele , carried out by the research team led by D . G . Drubin , yielded the four anc ( for actin - non - complementing ) mutations ( 445 ) . The ANC1 gene has been cloned and characterized . Anc1p is a nuclear protein showing homology to human proteins involved in the development of leukemias . Deletion in ANC1 and SLA1 leads to synthetic lethality , but , interestingly , the anc1 deletion phenotype alone causes a unique pattern of cytoskeletal and morphogenetic alterations ( 444 ) . One of the unique features of an anc1 mu - tant is the delocalization of Spa2p . How this protein inﬂuences actin and Spa2p polarization remains obscure , although it would open an unexplored ﬁeld in the control of morphogen - esis . Yeast unconventional class V myosins are encoded by the MYO2 and MYO4 genes . Mutations in MYO2 lead to severe defects in polarized secretion and morphogenesis ( 171 , 175 , 217 ) . Temperature - sensitive mutants fail to form a bud , and null mutants are nonviable . The actin - Myo2p interaction in the yeast cell is thought to promote the transport of secretory vesicles along actin cables ( 2 , 171 , 227 ) , although recent data have shown that its cellular localization matches that of cortical actin ( 264 ) . Its homolog MYO4 is not essential ( 175 ) , and so far there is no evidence for its involvement in polarized secretion . A conventional type II myosin heavy chain , the MYO1 gene product ( 366 , 416 ) , also shows morphologic alterations when mutated , reminiscent of those observed when MYO2 or MYO4 is overexpressed ( 175 ) . However , its function is unknown , and it seems unlikely that it would play a role in bud development . A component which interacts functionally with actin cables , tropomyosin ( encoded by the TPM1 gene ) , has also been iden - tiﬁed ( 269 , 270 ) . Disruption of TPM1 leads to abnormal chitin distribution but does not cause a very dramatic effect in cell development . The accumulation of secretory vesicles observed in tpm1 mutants is diminished when earlier steps of the secre - tory pathway are affected ( sec13 and sec18 mutations ) ( 270 ) , suggesting that the role of tropomyosin in secretion takes place at a post - Golgi stage . A conditional mutation in MYO2 is synthetic lethal with tpm1 ( 270 ) , and its pattern of vesicle accumulation also suggests a post - Golgi role in the secretory pathway ( 171 ) . A minor nonredundant tropomyosin , encoded by TPM2 , is found in S . cerevisiae ( 122 ) . A tpm2 disruption 368 CID ET AL . M ICROBIOL .

Since this phenotype is remediable by cooverexpression of TPM1 and since the two tropomyosins affect each other’s binding to actin in vitro ( 122 ) , it is likely that at least Tpm1p interacts with the bud site assembly mecha - nisms . To summarize , actin , unconventional myosin , and tropomy - osin are important for both the establishment and develop - ment of polarized secretion . It is conceivable that other genes involved in the general secretory pathways might also be im - portant for cell surface growth . Study of the SEC genes ( 322 ) , especially those involved in the late stages of secretion , might also provide important clues for our understanding of how determinants for cell wall growth are targeted to discrete points on the cell surface . For instance , it has been reported that a membrane complex formed by the proteins Sec8p and Sec15p , probably under the control of the small GTP - binding protein Sec4p , is responsible for exocytosis of the secretory vesicles ( 40 ) , a process that would obviously be critical for the release of cell wall precursors to the periplasmic space . Con - sistent with this , Sec4p accumulates at sites of cell growth ( 321 ) . Nevertheless , the secretion of invertase is not affected in either tpm1 or myo2 mutants ( 171 , 270 ) , implying the existence of two distinct secretory pathways : an actin - dependent one involved in cell surface growth , and a nonspecialized one which is not dependent on actin . Defects in the actin cytoskeleton also lead to osmosensitivity ( 319 ) . In fact , an actin mutant has been isolated in a screen for osmotically fragile mutants ( 386 ) . Considering the data which we have reviewed so far , a failure in the actin cytoskeleton would lead to impaired polarized secretion and therefore to a defective cell wall unable to efﬁciently protect the cell from an anisoosmolar environment . Strikingly , however , after exposure of a wild - type strain to hyperosmotic medium , the actin cy - toskeleton disassembles for a time and then reorganizes again ( 85 , 260a ) , suggesting that some factors , speciﬁcally present under osmotic stress conditions , might account for this rear - rangement . Chowdhury et al . ( 85 ) have isolated three suppres - sors of the osmosensitive ( but not the thermosensitive ) defect in act1 - 1 conditional mutants . One of these genes , RAH3 , is a new putative actin - binding protein . Its disruption leads to an altered actin localization and chitin distribution around the cell surface ( 85 ) . This phenotype is common to previously de - scribed mutations in many other genes that code for actin - associated proteins . Also supporting a speciﬁc control of actin organization in response to environmental stress , another mu - tation which leads to abnormal morphology , impaired actin distribution , and altered budding patterns lies in the RVS167 gene . RVS167 is predicted to encode a protein with an SH3 domain ; the gene was originally identiﬁed in a screen to search for genes essential for the maintenance of viability during the stationary phase ( 23 ) . Other genes related to the function of RVS167 , namely , RVS161 , SUR4 , and FEN1 , have been re - ported to display altered budding patterns ( 131 ) , probably be - cause of the same involvement in cortical actin rearrange - ments . Microtubules Are Not Required for Morphogenesis Nocodozole - treated cells and tub2 ( tubulin - deﬁcient ) mu - tants form buds and mate normally ( 203 , 212 ) . Thus , microtu - bules are not required for bud or mating projection formation . However , it is worth mentioning two facts that suggest that microtubules may play an ancillary role in bud formation : ( i ) as stated above , microtubules extend into the nascent bud and shmoo tip , and the SPB ( the structure which organizes the microtubular cytoskeleton ) always faces the growing areas ( 2 , 227 ) ; and ( ii ) strains bearing a temperature - sensitive mutation in myo2 can be suppressed by overexpression of SMY1 , a gene encoding a kinesin - related protein ( 263 ) . Smy1p has been shown to colocalize with Myo2p at the regions of polarized growth instead of displaying the localization pattern of micro - tubules ( 264 ) . Thus , although tubulin is dispensable for mor - phogenesis , we cannot presently discard the possibility that actin and microtubules participate in polarized cell growth in yeast cells , with actin playing the most predominant and es - sential role . Role for Ca 2 (cid:49) ? As pointed out above , such an accurate localization of the cytoskeletal elements to the bud site must be strictly con - trolled , and this control must somehow be connected to that of the nuclear events of the cell cycle . We have already discussed the putative leading role of the CDC28 gene product , but other pieces of the puzzle remain to be deciphered . A signiﬁcant key to the morphogenetic machinery is CDC24 ( Fig . 5 ; Table 4 ) ( see below ) ( 297 , 404 ) . Mutants defective in this gene fail to organize all the cytoskeletal elements for polarized growth ( 1 ) , causing the cells to develop large , unbudded morphologies with multiple nuclei ( 404 ) . CDC24 encodes a putative calcium - binding protein ( 298 ) . In fact , some cdc24 mutations elicit the inability to bud in a calcium - dependent way ( 329 ) . Besides , the sequence of the aforementioned End3p , involved in actin func - tion , also shows a putative calcium - binding domain ( 27 ) . These observations suggest an interconnection between calcium in - tracellular levels and morphogenetic events in yeast cells , thus establishing a correlation with cell surface events in higher eukaryotes , in which free Ca 2 (cid:49) , together with changes in phos - pholipids and phosphorylation , is believed to regulate actin rearrangements in response to different stimuli ( 410 ) . It is worth mentioning that Hkr1p , a transmembrane protein that may control 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthesis through an unknown mechanism ( see above ) , also bears a consensus sequence for calcium binding ( 248 ) . Moreover , as stated in a previous sec - tion , the FKS1 and FKS2 genes , believed to encode subunits of the 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthase , might be regulated by Ca 2 (cid:49) / calm - odulin - dependent calcineurin ( 120 , 151 ) . The possibility there - fore exists that the regulation of glucan synthesis is also medi - ated by the levels of free Ca 2 (cid:49) . The isolation of MID1 in a screen for cells that lyse after differentiating into shmoos ( 206 ) sheds some light on the role of calcium in morphogenesis during mating . MID1 is predicted to encode a plasma membrane protein which is important for Ca 2 (cid:49) uptake . In fact , lysis of mating forms in mid1 mutants is prevented when high concentrations of CaCl 2 , but not other salts , are added to the medium ( 206 ) . Furthermore , a second mating pheromone - induced death gene , MID2 , has been cloned and seems to encode another membrane protein , in this case showing a putative calcium - binding domain ( cited in ref - erence 206 ) . Additional evidence supporting a presumptive role of cal - cium ions in the morphogenetic process is the presence of calmodulin ( Cmd1p ) in active growth sites ( 43 ) . Like actin , calmodulin localizes to the selected bud site before bud emer - gence ; it then passes to the tip of the growing bud and , ﬁnally , redistributes to the septum at the time of cytokinesis . Further - more , actin and calmodulin localizations are interdependent ( cmd1 mutants fail to localize actin , and act1 mutants fail to localize calmodulin ) ( 43 ) , and a subset of cmd1 mutants fail to polarize cell surface growth in a way reminiscent of cdc24 V OL . 59 , 1995 CELL INTEGRITY AND MORPHOGENESIS IN S .

Nevertheless , polarized calmodulin localization does not depend on its ability to bind Ca 2 (cid:49) since it persists when the cation - binding site is mutated ( 43 ) . Although it is very unlikely that actin and calmodulin would interact physi - cally , it is plausible that calmodulin might interact with any actin - binding protein . Actually , a candidate may be Myo2p , which also colocalizes with actin ( 264 ) and bears in its se - quence six putative calmodulin - binding sites ( 217 ) . cdc24 mu - tants fail to localize both calmodulin and actin ( 413 ) , so this gene must direct a crucial step in the control of the rearrange - ments taking place prior to bud emergence . To learn how CDC24 manages to regulate morphogenesis , researchers have attempted to ﬁnd genes that could interact with it functionally ( see Fig . 5 ) . Multicopy suppressors of cdc24 mutations are found in BUD1 / RSR1 , CDC42 , MSB1 , and MSB2 ( 24 ) . The isolation of BUD1 / RSR1 ( see above ) links the events that regulate bud site selection to the essential events required for polarized growth . CDC42 encodes a Ras - like GTPase ( see the following section ) , which exhibits a cdc24 - like phenotype when disrupted ( 1 ) . MSB2 encodes a putative trans - membrane protein lacking any known catalytic or regulatory activity ; its abundance in Ser / Thr residues , an uncommon fea - ture also found in chitinase , Kre1p , Hkr1p , Fus1p , and some other mannoproteins , suggests that it could be O glycosylated ( 26 ) . Both MSB ( for multicopy suppression of budding defect ) genes show no phenotype when disrupted , and a synthetic lethal screen was devised for uncovering MSB1 - related or in - teracting genes ( 25 ) . These experiments yielded two genes whose defect also results in a cdc24 - like phenotype : large un - budded multinucleate cells . They were called BEM1 and BEM2 ( for bud emergence ) . Interestingly , BEM1 is important for cell polarity in both bud and shmoo development and contains two SH3 domains in its sequence ( 79 , 80 ) , like those in Sla1 , Abp1 , Rvs167 ( 23 , 125 , 196 ) . It has recently been reported that Bem1p and Cdc24p interact physically ( 345 ) . Moreover , Ca 2 (cid:49) seems to inhibit such interaction in vitro ( 459 ) . All the evi - dence suggests that Bem1p and Cdc24p are key components required for the attachment of the actin cytoskeleton to the cell surface and that calcium may mediate in their function . Rho Proteins A growing collection of membrane - associated Ras - related GTP - binding proteins have been found to participate in the control of morphogenetic processes ( Fig . 5 ) . They belong to the Rho group of proteins within the Ras superfamily . The common features of Rho proteins are that ( i ) they all carry prenylation sequences , and the addition of lipid moieties to these domains modulates their binding to membranes and may therefore affect their activity ; ( ii ) like Ras , they all bind gua - nine nucleotides , being active when bound to GTP and inactive when bound to GDP ; ( iii ) they are able to hydrolyze GTP , for which they require a GAP , which acts as a negative modulator ; ( iv ) a GEF is involved in their activation , closing the GTPase cycle ; and ( v ) they are thought to stimulate actin reorganiza - tion in vivo ( 168 ; see reference 177 for a review ) . We currently know of ﬁve Ras - like - encoding genes in bud - ding yeast which are involved in morphogenesis : CDC42 , RHO1 , RHO2 , RHO3 , and RHO4 ( 1 , 216 , 276 , 290 , 351 ) . CDC42 is by far the best characterized of them . The structure and functionality of Cdc42p seem to be highly conserved , since homologous genes playing an identical role have been found in the ﬁssion yeast S . pombe ( 296 ) and even in human cells ( 177 ) . Supporting its role in actin polarization , it has been recently shown that Cdc42p is essential for the GTP - dependent nucle - ation of actin in ﬁxed yeast cells ( 261 ) . As mentioned before , CDC42 is known to act as a multicopy suppressor of cdc24 mutations . Recently , Zheng et al . reported that Cdc24p is indeed a quite speciﬁc GEF for Cdc42p , while a novel gene , designated BEM3 , which had been isolated as a suppressor of FIG . 5 .

To be added to the list headed by SH2 and SH3 domains involved in protein - protein interactions in regulatory pathways at cortical level in eukaryotes ( 233 , 341 ) is a recently described kind of domain present in undermem - brane signalling proteins ; it has been called PH ( for pleckstrin homology ) ( 307 ) . Interestingly , the amino acid sequences of both Cdc42p modulators , Cdc24p and Bem3p , reveal a PH domain . Mutations in the BEM2 gene have been isolated in different approaches : ( i ) as synthetic lethal with msb1 ( 25 ) ; ( ii ) in a different screen for synthetic lethality with spa2 ( 279 ) ; ( iii ) in a third synthetic lethal screen with bem1 ( 345 ) ; ( iv ) in a search for mutations suppressing cdc55 ( see below ) ( 187 ) ; ( v ) in a screen for increase - in - ploidy mutants ( 73 ) ; and ( vi ) in a screen for lytic mutants ( 87 ) . Bem2p is another Rho - GAP but is unable to function in the Cdc42 GTPase cycle ( 345 , 460 , 461 ) . Experimental evidence has shown that Bem2p would rather act as a GAP for Rho1p or perhaps Rho2p GTPases ( 229 , 345 ) . bem2 mutations cause a budding defect similar to that ob - served in cdc42 and cdc24 mutants , although less severe . Cell enlargement is severe at 37 (cid:56) C and is accompanied by actin and chitin delocalization , appearance of huge bud scars , and de - fects in cell separation ( 87 , 229 , 345 ) . The cell wall composition in bem2 mutants may be altered , since they are more sensitive than controls to killer toxin , cell wall synthesis inhibitors , and exogenous enzymatic degradation of (cid:98) - glucan ( 87 ) . The ob - served increase in ploidy is probably due to consecutive nuclear divisions uncoupled from budding . Synthetic lethality and mu - tational suppression experiments performed on bem2 ( Fig . 5 ) suggest that phosphorylation could be involved on its regula - tion ( 229 ) . Taken together , the above observations support the hypothesis that cell cycle - controlled polarization of growth and cell wall biogenesis are interdependent or , at least , obey com - mon signals . cdc24 suppression by BUD1 / RSR1 ( 24 ) could be due to over - lapping substrate speciﬁcity or functional redundancy among the different Ras - like proteins , although experimental ﬁndings favor the hypothesis that Cdc24p would establish a close rela - tionship between the control of bud development and the selection of cell polarity . In fact , it has recently been reported that GTP - bound Rsr1p interacts in vitro with Cdc24p ( 459 ) . This interaction does not inﬂuence the GEF function of Cdc24p on Cdc42p , and it appears to stabilize the GTP - bound form of Rsr1p . It is tempting to theorize that a sequential activation of both GTPase cycles would be mediated by Cdc24p . Another clue to the link between bud site selection and bud emergence controlling sets is the fact that the triple mutant cln1 cln2 bud2 shows an unbudded cdc24 - like pheno - type instead of the expected plain defect in budding pattern ( 28 , 101 ) . The same lethal effect is caused by an activated RSR1 allele on a cln1 cln2 background ( 28 ) ; this is logical if one considers that Bud2p is a GAP and thus a negative regulator for Rsr1p ( 338 ) . A third link is given by the fact that a func - tional interaction may occur between BUD5 ( the GEF for Rsr1p ) and BEM1 based on the synthetic lethality caused by their concurrent mutations ( 75 ) . The hypothesis that Cdc42p activation ultimately depends on G 1 cyclins is attractive . An - other interesting hypothesis is that the SH3 domains in some actin - binding proteins would be interacting with proline - rich regions of the Rho GAPs or exchange factors ( 86 ) . PH do - mains , such the ones in Cdc24p and Bem3p , might themselves interact with small GTP - binding proteins ( 307 ) . The resulting complex would trigger actin polymerization at the presumptive bud site . Regarding the prenylation of these proteins , two kinds of enzymes are responsible for that function : farnesyltransferases ( FTase ) and geranylgeranyltransferases ( GGTase ) . CDC43 / CAL1 is known to encode the (cid:98) - subunit of a GGTase essential for Cdc42 function ( 1 , 328 , 330 ) , whereas a putative (cid:97) - subunit , which may work equally for both FTase and GGTase func - tions , is encoded by RAM2 ( 186 , 292 ) . RHO1 and RHO2 were in fact isolated in a search for suppressors of a cdc43 mutation ( 351 ) . Both are prenylation targets for the CDC43 - encoded GGTase ( 330 ) and may also be involved in the control of the cortical actin network . In fact , Bem2p has been shown to pos - sess speciﬁc GAP activity over Rho1p , at least in vitro ( 345 , 460 ) , and Rho1p has been immunolocalized at the areas of polarized growth ( 452 ) . Finally , the family of yeast morphogenesis - related Rho pro - teins ( see Fig . 5 for a comprehensive view ) includes two more recently identiﬁed genes , RHO3 and RHO4 ( 290 ) . Their defect causes osmoremedial cell lysis , which is suppressed by CDC42 and BEM1 ( 291 ) . Suppressors of the rho3 mutation have been isolated ( 291 ) and should probably give further clues to how these proteins manage to control the organization and attach - ment of the actin cytoskeletal apparatus to a polarized site under the cell surface . Phosphorylation , Cell Integrity , and Morphogenesis The recent identiﬁcation of phosphorylation pathways es - sential for cell integrity has increased the number of known morphogenetic controls . In a relatively short time , many reg - ulatory genes coding for protein kinases have been cloned and characterized and their corresponding products have been shown to be organized in a conserved structure typical of the mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase signalling pathways ( 192 ) . The functionality of two of these cascades—namely , the PKC1 - controlled pathway ( 252 ) ( Fig . 6 ) and the high - osmolar - ity glycerol pathway ( 40 ) —is important for the generation of an osmotically stable cell wall structure and therefore for mor - phogenesis . We shall refer to the former as the cell integrity / proliferation pathway and to the latter as the osmosensing pathway ( Fig . 7 ) . Both molecular and biochemical approaches have led to the identiﬁcation of most of the components of these pathways . Their homology to the members of the well - known pheromone response pathway ( Fig . 7 ) has been of great help in the deﬁnition of their role and properties . A descrip - tion of some of the experimental observations reported thus far should help us to deﬁne a perspective for the precise role of these phosphorylation pathways in the control of morphogen - esis . Nevertheless , the ﬁeld is fast moving , and we can expect that much more information will have to be gained before we have a complete picture of the role of the cascades , the mech - anisms that activate them , and the kind of responses they produce . A list of protein kinases and phosphatases presum - ably involved in morphogenesis is given in Table 6 . The PKC1 - controlled pathway is essential for the integrity of proliferating cells . The integrity of proliferating yeast cells depends on the functionality of a number of protein kinase genes whose products seem to act sequentially . These are PKC1 , predicted to encode the only type C protein kinase so far detected in yeast cells , and a three - gene module character - istic of the extracellularly regulated kinase pathways , consist - ing of a MAP kinase kinase kinase ( MEKK ) , a MAP kinase kinase ( MEK ) , and a MAP kinase component ( Fig . 7 ) . In this case , the corresponding genes are BCK1 / SLK1 ( encoding the MEKK ) , MKK1 and MKK2 ( redundant in their function and encoding MEK ) , and SLT2 / MPK1 ( encoding the MAP kinase ) . Strains with null and other types of mutations in these genes V OL . 59 , 1995 CELL INTEGRITY AND MORPHOGENESIS IN S .

This supports the notion that the func - tionality of these genes would be required for the generation of a stable cell wall structure . However , the corresponding genes were isolated by different strategies . The functional and ge - netic interactions among these genes are shown in Fig . 6 . The family of mammalian serine / threonine protein kinases C is known to be vital in various types of cells , participating in the transmission of extracellular signals for the control of cell growth and proliferation ( 326 ) . The PKC1 gene was cloned from S . cerevisiae on the basis of its homology with probes derived from the catalytic and regulatory domains of rat PKC genes ( 258 ) . Deletion of the PKC1 gene in S . cerevisiae leads to death , with a terminal phenotype characterized by an arrest in growth at the stage of the cell cycle where a small bud has been formed and the DNA has been replicated . Therefore , PKC1 function would be essential for the G 2 - to - M transition . How - ever , the signiﬁcance of PKC1 in cell wall studies was advanced when it was demonstrated that pkc1 strains are osmotic reme - dial ( 256 ) . Furthermore , the PKC1 gene was reisolated by complementation of S . cerevisiae cly15 mutants , which are au - tolytic and can grow only in osmotically stabilized medium ( 337 ) . A thorough characterization of pkc1 deletion strains proved that Pkc1p function is essential for the formation of an osmotically stable cell wall ( 257 , 337 ) . The morphology of cell wall layers in ultrathin sections is somewhat modiﬁed in the strains lacking the gene ( 337 ) . Cell growth arrest is accompa - nied by an arrest in protein synthesis ; viability is lost , and the cytoplasmic contents are released to the external medium ( 256 ) . The PKC1 gene was also isolated by a third strategy , based on a screen for staurosporine - sensitive mutants , this com - pound being a speciﬁc inhibitor of type C protein kinases ( 456 ) . The same strategy has also led to the isolation of two morphogenesis - related protein kinases C in the ﬁssion yeast S . pombe ( 421 ) . Yoshida et al . have recently reported that as a result of the same staurosporine - based screening , a second gene , STT4 , determines sensitivity to this drug and , interest - ingly , seems to participate in the same pathway as PKC1 ( 457 ) . This conclusion was deduced from the fact that the staurospo - rine sensitivity of stt4 mutants was suppressed by PKC1 over - expression . Furthermore , stt4 deletion strains also show an osmoremedial phenotype . STT4 encodes a phosphatidylinosi - tol 4 - kinase ( 457 ) . Phosphatidylinositol kinases are often in - volved in signalling pathways in mammalian cells . A potential downstream protein kinase gene , BCK1 ( for bypass of C kinase , also called SLK1 and SSP31 ) , was identiﬁed as an extragenic suppressor of the pkc1 mutant phenotype ( 253 ) . The mutant allele displays the mutation upstream from the catalytic domain , close to a potential protein kinase C phosphorylation target . pkc1 mutations are suppressed by the mutant allele of BCK1 but not by overexpression of wild - type Bck1p ( 253 ) . BCK1 was also isolated by two other strategies : ( i ) synthetic lethality with the mutant allele spa2 ( 97 ) ( as men - tioned above , Spa2p localizes to positions of polarized growth and is involved in polarization during budding and mating [ 80 , 162 , 405 ] ) ; and ( ii ) high - copy suppression of smp3 mutants ( 208 ) . Interestingly , the SMP3 gene encodes a transmembrane protein whose defect causes defects in cell growth and plasmid stability ( 208 , 209 ) . Deletion of BCK1 also leads to a thermosensitive lytic phe - notype , which is rescued by addition of osmotic stabilizers ( e . g . , sorbitol ) to the growth medium ( 253 ) . Consistent with the spa2 synthetic lethal phenotype , BCK1 is also important in cell mor - phogenesis ; bck1 mutants are often heterogeneous in size and shape , and they exhibit a shmoo formation defect ( 97 ) . Diploid cells homozygous for the slk1 trait display sporulation deﬁ - ciency and poor viability under conditions of nutrient depriva - tion , thus suggesting a role for BCK1 / SLK1 in the transitions from mitotic cycle to meiosis or stationary phase ( 97 , 99 ) . The cloning of protein kinase genes relevant for cell integrity continued with the isolation of other multicopy suppressors of the phenotype of smp3 mutants , which identiﬁed MKK1 ( 210 ) . FIG . 6 .

The double deletion of both MKK1 and MKK2 does lead to cells that are nonviable at 37 (cid:56) C and display an autolytic phenotype similar to the one described for other kinase mu - tants ( 210 ) . The discovery of the MAP kinase component of the cell integrity / proliferation pathway was related from the beginning to cell wall research , since its isolation was made possible by the use of thermosensitive autolytic mutants ( 62 ) , which had been conceived as strains with potential alterations in their cell wall assembly ( 317 ) . The search for a DNA fragment that complements the lytic phenotype of S . cerevisiae lyt2 mutant strains led to the rather unexpected isolation of a protein kinase gene , SLT2 / MPK1 ( 422 ) , that was clearly involved in these phenomena . Although initial genetic evidence pointed out that SLT2 was a suppressor of the altered phenotype in lyt2 strains , the recently rescued original lyt2 mutant allele proved to be an slt2 mutant ( 70 ) . Deletion of the SLT2 gene resulted in a thermosensitive phenotype of cell lysis at 37 (cid:56) C with the corresponding release of the intracellular contents , which could be rescued under osmotic stabilization conditions ( 107 , 422 ) . Lysis requires active growth and takes place in cells with small buds . Interestingly , other phenotypes of the slt2 mutant include caffeine sensitivity , failure to undergo cell cycle arrest under nutrient depletion conditions , accumulation of secretory vesicles , and delocalization of chitin and actin in the mitotic cycle ( 99 , 252 , 293 ) . Slt2p , the putative product of the SLT2 gene , is a homolog of serine / threonine protein kinases , with a signiﬁcant similarity to other yeast protein kinases such as Fus3p and Kss1p ( 422 ) FIG . 7 .

The gene was placed in the cell integrity / proliferation pathway and renamed MPK1 when it was reisolated as a multicopy suppressor of a bck1 defect ( 252 ) . The functionality of Slt2p is dependent on the Lys - 54 residue , the putative active center for ATP binding ( 289 ) , as well as on Thr - 190 , a potential phosphorylation site conserved in MAP kinases and critical for their regulation ( 252 ) . Residue Tyr - 192 , another potential phosphorylation site of importance in the regulation of these proteins , was shown to be only partially needed for the functionality of the enzyme ( 252 ) , since the gene did not completely lose functionality upon mutation of this residue . Another salient and intriguing feature of the pro - tein is a polyglutamine fragment , consisting of 16 residues of this amino acid close to the C - terminal end , whose deletion does not seem to affect the functionality of the protein ( 346 ) . Mechanisms of activation and signal transduction in the cell integrity / proliferation pathway . Epistasis relationships among the above - mentioned protein kinase genes have been useful in establishing their order in the cell integrity / prolifer - ation pathway . However , the biochemical analysis of their in - teractions , as well as the activation of speciﬁc catalytic activi - ties , is providing new insights in the characterization of this pathway . This information should eventually lead to the clar - iﬁcation of two major issues with regard to the cell integrity / proliferation pathway that are still unknown . These are the nature of the stimulus and the sensor that receives it , thus activating Pkc1p , and the speciﬁc functions downstream of the MAP kinase encoded by SLT2 , which are activated as a result of the transmission of the signal . Pkc1p phosphorylates sub - strates similar to those of its mammalian counterpart and strongly associates with particulate fractions . Nevertheless , its in vitro activity does not seem to be regulated by typical co - factors such as phospholipids , diacylglycerol , and Ca 2 (cid:49) , so that it appears as a distantly related member of the protein kinase C superfamily ( 8 , 440 ) . Many pieces of evidence are conﬁrming the proposed se - quence of reactions between the protein kinase components of the cascade . For example , biochemical evidence supporting the activation of Bck1p by Pkc1p has been obtained ( 255 ) , and it has also been demonstrated that Slt2p interacts both in vivo and in vitro with both Mkk1p and Mkk2p ( 407 ) . The thermosensitivity of most of the S . cerevisiae null mu - tants with mutations in genes of this pathway was somewhat intriguing at the beginning . It was difﬁcult to explain why these genes are required only for growth at 37 (cid:56) C when the functions they affect , i . e . , the generation of an osmotically stable wall structure , should be required at any temperature . Very recent data obtained in experiments in which the cells were subjected to thermal shocks point to the critical requirement of a func - tional cell integrity / proliferation pathway at elevated temper - atures . These data have been obtained in the course of studies with SLT2 and MKC1 , the C . albicans homolog of SLT2 that displays more than 50 % identity with its S . cerevisiae counter - part ( 312 ) . Double - deletion strains mkc1 / mkc1 of the oppor - tunistic diploid fungus were shown to give rise to a cell wall that was more sensitive to the attack of exogenous lytic en - zymes than wild - type cell walls were . However , these changes seem to have an effect mostly on the stability of the cells to thermal shocks at 55 (cid:56) C , the null mutant displaying a clear loss of viability that affected only growing cells and not stationary - phase cells ( 312 ) . These data are very consistent with those of Levin ( 255 ) , who observed a protein synthesis - independent activation of the phosphorylation capacity of Slt2p by pretreat - ment at different elevated temperatures . The activation was clearly dependent on the temperature and occurred only in growing cells in which PKC1 and BCK1 genes were functional . Watanabe et al . ( 440 ) favor the idea that another , as yet unknown protein kinase must control the activity of Pkc1p . The discovery of this enzyme should be of considerable help in the identiﬁcation of the sensor that activates Pkc1p to transmit the corresponding signal through the cell integrity / prolifera - tion pathway . The consideration of the different types of stim - uli that seem to activate a response in the cascade should also prompt adequate hypotheses and experimental strategies for the elucidation of its precise role . As stated above , heat shocks clearly activate signal transduction in this pathway , and Levin ( 255 ) has suggested that the alterations in membrane ﬂuidity as a result of the temperature shift would activate the cascade in a response aimed at adapting membrane composition to the new situation . In any case , when considering the nature of the stimuli affecting the sensor of the Pkc1p - controlled pathway , we cannot forget other evidence that points to at least two other types of potential inputs in the cascade ( see below ) . One may be deﬁned by a possible relationship with the Cdc28p kinase ( 293 ) , and the other input would be produced under low - osmolarity conditions ( 172 ) . A potential upstream modu - lator of the cascade lies , as stated above , in the Stt4p phos - phatidylinositol kinase . Whether it is an alteration in membrane ﬂuidity / composi - tion and / or the wall structure or a different stimulus that trig - gers the sensor of the cell integrity / proliferation pathway , it is clear that the study of the functions downstream of Slt2p should also be of much help in this regard . Other MAP kinase pathways , including the S . cerevisiae mating / dimorphism re - sponse , converge on transcription factors ( Fig . 7 ) ( 192 ) . Many slt2 and bck1 defects are suppressed by overexpression of a set of chromatin proteins , Nhp6Ap and Nhp6Bp ( 98 ) . These pro - teins are probably not direct substrates of Slt2p / Mpk1p , be - cause they are not phosphoproteins ( 98 ) . Instead , a likely model is that Nhp6Ap and Nhp6Bp function with a transcrip - tion factor which is a substrate for Slt2p . Studies in progress in different laboratories indicate that transcription factors are under the control of the cell integrity / proliferation pathway . There is evidence for a potential involvement of Pkc1p in cell wall - related functions other than the ones it can affect through the kinase cascade . The basic fact is that while pkc1 mutants require an osmotically stabilized medium for viability at any temperature ( 256 , 337 ) , mutants with mutations in the downstream kinase genes of the cascade display this phenotype only at the nonpermissive temperature ( 210 , 252 , 422 ) . This indicates that PKC1 must be involved in cell integrity through a bifurcated pathway ( 257 ) ; Pkc1p could affect cell wall func - tions not only through its activation of the phosphorylation cascade but also by direct phosphorylation of some of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall structural components . This view has been reinforced by recent ﬁndings ( 47 , 369 ) that showed suppression of the lytic phenotype of pkc1 mutants by overexpression of the product of the KRE6 and SKN7 genes , which are involved in the synthesis of 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan ( Fig . 6 ) . Osmosensing pathway and its relationship with the cell in - tegrity / proliferation pathway . Recent evidence also points to the existence of yet another set of regulatory genes with a critical function for the stability of the cell , in this case under other stress conditions such as the increase in external osmo - larity . Eukaryotic cells adjust internal osmolarity to osmotic changes in the external medium ( 284 ) by creating an osmotic gradient through the plasma membrane that allows water into the cell . In S . cerevisiae , an increase in external osmolarity leads to a stimulation of the synthesis of glycerol and a decrease in 374 CID ET AL . M ICROBIOL .

Of most interest , in the context of the transduction of signals relevant for cell integrity , is the identiﬁcation of genetic elements that seem to deﬁne another cascade of kinases that would determine the cellular osmoregulatory response . This osmosensing system is clearly deﬁned by the isolation of mutants that fail to implement the osmoregulatory response . To a certain extent , these mutants would be the opposite of the autolytic mutants discussed above , since they are unstable at high external osmolarities . Molecular approaches to the characterization of these mutants ( 40 ) have led to the isolation of HOG1 , coding for a MAP kinase component in this pathway , and to the reisolation of HOG4 , previously known as PBS2 ( 35 ) , which constitutes the MEK element in the cascade . Deletion of PBS2 had been reported to determine high sensitivity to polymyxin B , and the cells did not survive under conditions of high external osmo - larity , showing growth arrest and aberrant morphology ( 34 ) . Additional data point to an antagonism between PBS2 and RAS2 that would involve this gene in the nutrient availability response pathway controlled by RAS genes ( 34 ) . The SLT2 / MPK1 cascade , on the other hand , has been reported not to depend on Ras , at least for its role in modulating the cell cycle arrest response to a lack of nutrients ( 99 ) . Knowledge of a system that could be the sensor , or one of the sensors , for this pathway controlling the activity of the cascade has advanced substantially with the discovery of genes SLN1 and SSK1 ( 281 ) . The relationship with the osmosensing pathway became apparent when two suppressors of sln1 mu - tants were identiﬁed as the HOG1 and PBS2 genes . Another suppressor of sln1 mutations was identiﬁed as SSK1 , which seems to encode the companion response regulator of the Sln1p histidin kinase . The products of SLN1 and SSK1 are quite similar to bacterial sensing elements known as two - com - ponents systems . A serine / threonine phosphatase , the product of the PTC1 gene ( 280 ) , also seems to operate in this pathway ( 214 ) , probably by dephosphorylation of the MAP kinase , lead - ing to inactivation or attenuation of the signal . The most outstanding fact with regard to the relationship between the cell integrity / proliferation and the osmosensing MAP kinase pathways has been found in the course of studies that monitored the osmotic stress responses . Gustin et al . ( 172 ) have found that high - osmolarity conditions not only activate the osmosensing pathway but also prevent tyrosine phosphor - ylation of Slt2p . However , the opposite takes place under hy - potonic shock , which leads to an accumulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of this MAP kinase , and the phenomenon is dependent on the functionality of the cell integrity / prolifera - tion pathway . It follows that the two pathways we are consid - ering , cell integrity / proliferation and osmosensing , would be regulated in response to osmotic alterations in the external medium . The former would respond to hypotonic conditions , while the latter is activated by hypertonic shocks ( 172 ) . Connecting the PKC1 cascade to cell cycle and morphoge - netic functions . The work of Mazzoni et al . ( 293 ) points toward the importance of the SLT2 / MPK1 function in polarized growth . These authors have observed that slt2 mutant strains growing at a nonpermissive temperature display a large num - ber of abnormally small or large cells , an alteration in the pattern of chitin deposition , an abnormal distribution of actin , and an accumulation of secretory vesicles , a phenotype which resembles that of pfy1 , cap1 , cap2 , sac6 , bem1 , rho3 , and rho4 and , in general , mutations in genes essential for polarized growth ( see above ) . All these facts suggest that Slt2p might play a role in the correct cytoskeletal function for polarized growth , which is consistent with the observation of the lack of viability of slt2 act1 or slt2 myo2 double mutations ( 293 ) . The same authors isolated the mutant allele slt2 - 1 as an enhancer of the cell division defect of cdc28 - 109 mutants ( 293 ) , consistent with the previously reported need for Cdc28 activation for the initiation of budding ( 259 ) . This observation would suggest that the SLT2 pathway is regulated by protein kinase Cdc28 or , alternatively , that both SLT2 and CDC28 act in parallel in the promotion of the budding process ( 293 ) . The same authors reported the evidence that the defective phenotype of a cdc28 - 4 mutant , in which the speciﬁc G 1 functions are affected , is enhanced by an SLT2 deletion , but this does not occur in cdc28 - 1N , which is speciﬁcally defective in G 2 / M functions . This fact would place the action of SLT2 in the G 1 phase ( 293 ) . Furthermore , Lee et al . isolated a gene named BCK2 in a screen for multicopy suppressors of the slt2 / mpk1 trait . Over - expression of this gene also suppresses a pkc1 mutation ( 251 ) . Interestingly , Bck2p is a modulator of the expression of the G 1 cyclins ( 116 ) . The genetic interaction between SLT2 / MPK1 and BCK2 implies two possibilities : ( i ) the existence of two parallel pathways with common transcriptional targets and ( ii ) the participation of the PKC - led pathway in the transcriptional events regulated by Bck2p . A complete clariﬁcation of these appealing results must await the molecular characterization of the phosphorylation target ( s ) of Slt2p . Protein phosphatases involved in morphogenesis . Although more than 50 protein kinases have been characterized in S . cerevisiae , only a few protein phosphatases are known . Genes coding for protein phosphorylating / dephosphorylating en - zymes with a potential role in yeast morphogenesis are listed in Table 6 . Mutant phenotypes and genetic interactions suggest that type 2A protein phosphatase activity ( PP2A ) , which has been reported to regulate glycogen metabolism ( 91 ) , is in - volved in morphogenetic control as well . PPH21 and PPH22 are two PP2A catalytic subunit - encoding genes that , together with the PPH3 gene , were shown to be important for cell growth and morphogenesis ( 373 ) . The lack of any one of these genes caused no noticeable phenotype , but when both PPH21 and PPH22 were deleted , cell growth was impaired , and the triple mutant pph21 pph22 pph3 was not viable . When overex - pressed , these genes caused dose - dependent changes in cell shape ( 373 ) , leading to huge , round , multinucleate cells ( a bem2 - like phenotype ) . Recent studies of a pph21 temperature - sensitive allele show that actin and chitin are mislocalized at nonpermissive temperatures , revealing a role for PP2A in actin cytoskeleton organization . Putative A and B regulatory sub - units for PP2A lie in TPD3 and CDC55 , respectively ( 187 , 434 ) . Both genes , when disrupted , show a cold - sensitive aberrant phenotype , with multibudded and multinucleated cells , posi - tively suggesting a role for PP2A in morphogenesis . A cdc55 - like phenotype is exhibited by a thermosensitive yck1 yck2 double mutant , and yck mutations are lethal in the background of cdc55 mutations ( 364 ) . YCK genes encode casein kinases . PP2A and casein kinases could account for dephosphorylation / phosphorylation reactions on common substrates for the reg - ulation of cell shape . CDC55 is thought to participate in the regulation of cytokinesis , but , remarkably , a cdc55 mutant can be suppressed by mutant alleles of the Rho - GAP bem2 ( see above ) ( 187 ) . In addition to these data , a mutation in GRR1 , a gene involved in the control of glucose uptake and turnover of G 1 cyclins ( 20 , 147 ) , is synthetic lethal with cdc55 and is able to partially suppress a bem2 phenotype ( 229 ) . Thus , it is likely that the Bem2p function is regulated either by direct or indi - rect phosphorylation . SRK1 / SSD1 is a gene coding for a protein related to phos - phatase function which was isolated as a suppressor of the defects caused by deletion of SIT4 , a PP2A - like phosphatase gene ( 415 ) . Sit4p has been thought to operate on cell cycle V OL . 59 , 1995 CELL INTEGRITY AND MORPHOGENESIS IN S .

A relationship of SRK1 / SSD1 with the PKC1 cascade is suggested by the facts that its deletion in an slt2 background enhances the impairment of growth and that allele SSD1 - v1 partially suppresses lysis in a slt2 - 1 ssd1 - d background ( 252 ) . Furthermore , a similar phenomenon occurs in a bem2 ssd1 - d background ( 229 ) . Recently , a new aspect of morphogenesis in S . cerevisiae has been unveiled : its ability , under certain conditions , to develop pseudohyphal growth ( 166 ) . This phenomenon occurs only un - der certain starvation conditions and results in the develop - ment of chains of elongated cells that extend into the sur - rounding medium . Liu et al . ( 271 ) have reported that some of the genes involved in the response to mating pheromone in haploids also work in diploids in any function related to this dimorphism ( Fig . 7 ) . Some recent experiments suggest that Cdc55 and therefore PP2A activity could be of relevance for this dimorphic transition too . This assertion is based on the observation that cdc55 mutations are synergic with those in the ELM1 gene , which was isolated in a screen for mutations that constitutively expressed a ﬁlamentous growth ( 31 ) . Further - more , overexpression of PAM1 , a gene that suppresses the growth defect in PP2A - deﬁcient strains , causes a ﬁlamentous growth pattern reminiscent of pseudohyphae ( 201 ) . In spite of these results , we are still ignorant of the precise role played by PP2A activity in cell surface growth regulation . A type C protein phosphatase activity ( PP2C ) is represented in yeast cells by the TPD1 gene product ( 365 ) . Strains deleted for this gene show multibudded cells , thus displaying a failure in cell separation . The controls of cell separation are poorly understood , and no conclusions can be reached from the present data . By contrast , another PP2C - like serine / threonine protein phosphatase , Ptc1p ( 280 ) , has been reported to work as a potential modulator of the signal transduced by the osmo - sensing MAP kinase cascade ( 214 ) ( Fig . 7 ) . Other putative protein phosphatase elements manifest a ge - netic relationship with the PKC1 pathway . PPZ1 ( 348 ) and PPZ2 ( 103 ) are two yeast phosphatase genes which were iden - tiﬁed independently . Deletion of both genes leads to an auto - lytic caffeine - sensitive phenotype , which is rescued by the pres - ence of an osmotic stabilizer ( 348 ) and is similar to phenotypes of strains deleted in genes of the PKC1 cascade ( 204 ) . More - over , the PPZ2 gene has been cloned as a multicopy suppressor of slt2 / mpk1 deletion strains and has been shown to suppress lysis associated with thermosensitive alleles of bck1 / slk1 and pkc1 ( 251 ) . The relationship of these two phosphatase genes with the PKC1 pathway seems clear , although it is not possible , with the evidence available , to locate their action at a speciﬁc place ( s ) in the phosphorylation cascade . It has been proposed that the Ppz protein phosphatases could act on a pathway parallel to the one led by Pkc1p ( 251 ) . GLOBAL VIEW : CHASING THE LINKS A vast array of yeast genes with a function presumably re - lated to morphogenesis has been revealed . As deduced from biochemical studies , some of them have an obvious implication in cell wall biosynthesis , actin polymerization , or signal trans - duction . However , in most cases , this implication is based on only genetic evidence or in vitro studies , but the particular in vivo function of many of the genes isolated so far remains obscure . The challenge now is to ﬁll in the gaps and relate cell signalling to the polarization of growth and to wall biosynthe - sis . Figure 8 ventures a glance at the global sequence that leads to cell surface growth during budding . In this model , we pro - pose that bud emergence should be promoted by two simulta - neous events : polarized secretion and the onset of cell wall biosynthesis . How both processes are coordinated in the cell is not currently understood , although important hints have re - cently emerged ( see below ) . Polarized secretion is conducted by the cortical cytoskeleton , a complex system of actin ﬁla - ments and actin - associated proteins whose assembly is con - trolled by Rho proteins . The function of Rho GTPases may respond , or run parallel , to signalling pathways in which phos - FIG . 8 . A potential sequence of the different processes that control morphogenesis for the initiation of budding . Question marks are placed in the most unsettled links . This model presents the dependence of bud emergence on both the process of polarized secretion and the activation of cell wall biosynthetic machinery . How the two processes are correlated is not known . It is expected that the triggering of both processes depends on common signals elicited by cell cycle controls . See the section on a global view in the text for further information . 376 CID ET AL . M ICROBIOL .

Remarkably , interac - tions of Rho proteins with unconventional myosin ( 358 ) and protein kinases involved in signal transduction ( 288 ) have been recently found in mammalian cells . The undermembrane spot in which all these events must take place is probably marked by speciﬁc remnants from the last cell cycle , and temporal control is achieved by START - dependent signals . The PKC - led and osmosensing MAP kinase cascades may be counterbalancing the regulation of the same events in response to the status of cell surface . One of the common links between (cid:98) - glucan synthesis acti - vation and polarized secretion could be a potential regulation by the calcium levels ( see the section on a role for calcium , above ) , but other possible links are coming into sight . Remark - ably , the latest ﬁndings extend the importance of small GTP - binding proteins to the regulation of 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthesis . Particularly , the outstanding results of Mol et al . provide bio - chemical evidence for the implication of a small GTP - binding protein in the direct regulation of 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthase ( 300 ) . In addition , a functional and structural homolog of the Rho GGTase encoded by CDC43 , which complements the defects of a ﬁssion yeast lytic mutant showing a low level of (cid:98) - glucan synthase activity , has been cloned in S . pombe ( 114 , 359 ) . In addition , the products of the genes MSB2 —a multicopy sup - pressor of cdc24 —and HKR —encoding a putative modulator of glucan synthesis—show structural similarities that might denote a common function . Moreover , mutants with mutations in BEM2 , encoding a Rho - GAP , display a weak cell wall ( 87 ) , which may reﬂect alterations in its composition . It is worth mentioning in this context that strains bearing mutations in some of the RHO genes display a cell lysis defect that can be prevented by osmotic stabilization , thus implying an altered cell wall ( 291 ) . Anyway , it is still unclear whether the alter - ations in cell wall and impairment of 1 , 3 - (cid:98) - glucan synthase activity are an indirect effect of the polarization defect or whether Rho proteins are indeed one of the links that coordi - nate polarized secretion and cell wall biogenesis . Spa2p is certainly an intriguing piece in the cellular machin - ery for cell polarity . It resembles no other sequence and seems nonessential for morphogenesis , except for the selection of polarity and for mating efﬁciency ( 162 ) . Nevertheless , it be - comes essential in strains lacking diverse genes that share the only feature of being important for morphogenesis , such as septin ( CDC10 ) , a transcription factor important for START ( SWI4 ) , protein kinases from the cell integrity / proliferation cascade ( BCK1 and SLT2 ) , or bud emergence genes ( BEM1 and BEM2 ) ( 279 ) . An exciting result is the recent isolation of MKK1 as a two - hybrid interactor with SPA2 ( 100 ) . The possi - bility that Mkk1p and Spa2p really interact in vivo generates a highly interesting link between cell polarity and the protein kinase C cascade . Another interesting piece is Gas1p / Ggp1p ( 347 , 352 ) . This GPI - anchored mannoprotein is cell cycle regulated , and its apparently relevant implication in morphogenesis is surprising for a protein which is supposed to be located in the extracel - lular compartment . It is predictable that this protein plays a key role in the control of cell wall assembly during growth , although we currently ignore its function or its molecular in - teractions . Some more encouraging results come from the implication of the osmosensing MAP kinase pathway in (cid:98) - glucan degra - dation . Among genes which cause a killer toxin resistance phenotype when overexpressed , EXG1 , PBS2 , and PTC1 were found ( 214 ) . As stated above , PBS2 and PTC1 encode , respec - tively , a MEK and a phosphatase that mediate in the osmo - sensing pathway . Interestingly , both EXG1 mRNA levels and exo - (cid:98) - glucanase activity are higher when these genes are over - expressed ( 214 ) , so that killer resistance is probably due to a higher Exg I activity in all three cases . Other studies point out that Bgl2p , encoding another (cid:98) - glucanase ( see above ) , is par - tially responsible for the morphogenetic defects of protein kinase C mutants , since a bgl2 mutation partially suppresses a pkc1 growth defect ( 397 ) . The biological signiﬁcance of these results awaits the elucidation of the precise role of glucanases in cell wall dynamics . Further results that link the cell integrity / proliferation sig - nalling cascade to cell wall synthesis are the genetic interac - tions between the genes involved in 1 , 6 - (cid:98) - glucan synthetic pathways and those coding for protein kinases of this cascade ( 369 ) ( Fig . 6 ) . pkc1 defects are rescued by SKN7 ( 47 ) and KRE6 ( 369 ) , and synthetic lethality is observed in strains with double deletions in pkc1 and kre6 , pkc1 and skn1 , pkc1 and kre11 , pkc1 and kre2 , or slt2 and kre6 , and triple mkk1 mkk2 kre6 or mkk1 mkk2 kre11 mutants ( 369 ) . Another point of interest is the recently unveiled ultrastruc - ture of the actin ﬁlaments - plasma membrane association ( 306 ) , which will probably contribute to our understanding of the last stages of polarized secretion . A possible role of the reported ﬁnger - like invaginations at the sites of actin assembly would be to reduce the local turgor pressure at the growing spots ( 306 ) , where the developing cell wall should be less protective , as has been said to occur in some bacteria ( 232 ) . Whether direct or indirect , a link between cell wall structure and the actin cy - toskeleton is given by the work of Gabriel and Kopecka´ , who showed that the texture of the glucan matrix is abnormal when an actin mutant phenotype is expressed ( 156a , 156b ) , suggest - ing that the actin - plasma membrane complex is indeed impor - tant for a proper assembly of the cell wall polymers . One of the most fascinating aspects of yeast morphogenesis is the accurate disposition of chitin at the mother - daughter junction and in the primary septum ( Fig . 2A and B , panel 1 ) . As stated above , CSIII is responsible for the bulk of chitin synthesis , including the ring , and spatial as well as other evi - dence points to the possibility that septins are involved in the control of chitin deposition ( see above ) . In any case , since mutations that speciﬁcally affect the assembly of the actin cy - toskeleton also provoke an aberrant deposition of chitin , it is likely that both septins and actin are involved in the polariza - tion of chitin synthesis . CSII seems responsible for chitin dep - osition at the septum ( see above ) , and it is interesting that both Act2p , which may have a speciﬁc role in the control of septa - tion , and Chs2p ( CSII ) bear putative phosphorylation targets for the Cdc28p kinase . Septin mutants are defective in the localization of the septum , meaning that the neck microﬁla - ments may also mediate in this process . The control of cell separation may depend on the regulation of chitinase , whose hydrolytic function is counterbalanced by CSI ( see above ) . Morphogenesis in the shmoo is also starting to be revealed ( see reference 78 for a review ) , and a connection of the mating pheromone response pathway to the polarization of growth for shmoo formation may be given by the recent isolation of a novel putative GAP for Cdc42p , encoded by RGA1 , whose loss constitutively activates the mating pheromone - dependent phosphorylation cascade ( 408a ) . An interesting observation is that the human homologs of Cdc42p and Ste20p physically interact ( 288 ) . If this is demonstrated to occur in yeast as well , we would be able to connect cell surface morphogenetic sig - nalling to pathways that regulate transcriptional events . Other complex morphogenetic processes , such as sporulation and pseudohyphal growth , also deserve our attention . Neverthe - less , the amount of data presented so far is very limited . Sporu - lation is known to involve speciﬁc cell wall biosynthetic and V OL . 59 , 1995 CELL INTEGRITY AND MORPHOGENESIS IN S .

Some light was shed on this subject when two novel protein kinases , a Ste20 - homolog ( Sps1p ) and a MAP kinase ( Smk1 ) , related to sporulation were recently found ( 155 , 276 ) . Strains deleted in SPS1 show a spore wall lacking the chitosan and dityrosin - rich layers ( 155 ) , whereas deletion of SMK1 causes an aberrant and clearly unprotective spore wall in which the layered structure is still manifest but the disposition of the layers is inappropriate ( 276 ) . A very appealing idea is that specialized MAP kinase cascades would be controlling distinct aspects of morphogenesis through the yeast life cycle ( Slt2p and Hog1p for budding , Fus3p and Kss1p for mating , Smk1 for sporulation , and some other yet un - known , although sharing upstream components with the mat - ing pathway , for pseudohyphal growth ) . Regarding the dimor - phic transition for pseudohyphal growth , it sets new challenges for the study of morphogenesis , since cells elongate , cell sep - aration is bypassed , and growth is unipolar , in contrast to the usual bipolar pattern ( 166 , 242 ) . FINAL COMMENTS AND OUTLOOK To summarize , morphogenesis in unicellular eukaryotes such as S . cerevisiae is a complex process involving many path - ways and components . The efforts of many research teams have contributed much to our understanding of many compo - nents and events involved in morphogenesis and cell wall dep - osition , but many enigmas remain . For example , we do not understand how cell wall assembly is coordinated during growth , how Rho proteins function to regulate the actin cy - toskeleton , or how the recently unveiled phosphorylation path - ways obey environmental or internal signals , eventually regu - lating cell wall biosynthetic events for the maintenance of an osmotic balance . Further genetic and biochemical character - ization of new components and a deeper knowledge of the functions of the current ones and the interactions among them will undoubtedly help to elucidate the mechanisms by which these events occur . The analysis of cell wall assembly and its regulation can be of great relevance to the development of research in antifungal agents of clinical interest , and the study of yeast cell lysis may contribute to the solution of some current problems with cer - tain biotechnological processes . In addition , understanding how morphogenesis is achieved in simple cells will provide us with important clues to interpret how higher cellular systems adapt their shape to environmental challenges .
