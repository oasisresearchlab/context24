However , the mechanisms of germ cell speciﬁcation in mice remain unknown . Although maternal germ cell determinants are critical for germ cell formation in organisms such as Caenorhabditis , Drosophila and Xenopus , they do not seem to be involved in mouse germ cell allocation . Cell lineage analyses have revealed that a portion of proximal epiblast cells in pre - and early streak mouse embryos are common precursors of primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) and extra - embryonic mesoderm ( Lawson and Hage , 1994 ) and that ﬁnal cell fate is not yet determined at this time . In addition , after transplantation into the proximal region of the epiblast , distal epiblast cells that normally become ectoderm cells follow the fate of the proximal epiblast and give rise to PGCs as well as extra - embryonic mesoderm ( Tam and Zhou , 1996 ) . This also indicates that proximal location in the epiblast is important in becoming committed to PGCs . We established a primary culture system that can mimic PGC differentiation from the epiblast , and have shown that the extra - embryonic ectoderm induces the conditions required for PGC formation within the adjacent proximal epiblast ( Yoshimizu et al . , 2001 ) . In addition , studies of knockout mice have revealed that BMP4 / 8b signaling is critical for this induction event ( Lawson et al . , 1999 ; Ying et al . , 2000 ) , and recombinant BMPs can induce PGCs from epiblasts in culture ( Hayashi et al . , 2002 ) . Signals from BMP might induce precursors of PGCs and of extra - embryonic mesoderm , but may not be involved in actual PGC determination . Thus , a second local signal at the posterior end of the embryo might regulate allocation to the PGC lineage ( Lawson et al . , 1999 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2001 ) . The nature of this presumptive second signal remains obscure . A gene known as fragilis / mil - 1 that is potentially expressed in PGC precursors ( Saitou et al . , 2002 ; Tanaka and Matsui , 2002 ) encodes a transmembrane protein that belongs to the interferon induced transmembrane protein family , and it might be involved in cell - cell contact as well as cell growth control ( Deblandre et al . , 1995 ) . As yet there is no evidence that this gene functions in PGC formation . Cadherins are responsible for cell adhesion through calcium - dependent homophilic interactions and have various functions including cell differentiation ( Takeichi , 1991 ; Gumbiner , 1996 ; Laprise et al . , 2002 ) . For example , N - cadherin - dependent cell interactions in a group of muscle progenitors plays a crucial role in promoting differentiation into MyoD - expressing muscle in Xenopus embryos ( Holt et al . , 1994 ) . Although high levels of E - cadherin are expressed in the epiblast but not in the mesoderm , we show here that E - cadherin is expressed in the proximal extra - embryonic mesoderm that contains the PGC precursors and that cell - cell interaction mediated by E - cadherin is crucial for these precursors to be allocated to the germ cell lineage . The germ cell lineage segregates from the somatic cell lineages in early embryos . Germ cell determination in mice is not regulated by maternally inherited germplasm , but is initiated within the embryo during gastrulation . However , the mechanisms of germ cell speciﬁcation in mice remain unknown . We located precursors to primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) within early embryos , and show here that cell - cell interaction among these precursors is required for germ cell speciﬁcation . We found that the expression of a calcium - dependent cell adhesion molecule , E - cadherin , is restricted to the proximal region of extra - embryonic mesoderm that contains PGC precursors , and that blocking the functions of E - cadherin with an antibody inhibits PGC formation in vitro . These results showed that E - cadherin - mediated cell - cell interaction among cells containing PGC precursors is essential to directing such cells to the germ cell fate .

Embryos were staged before the experiments as described previously ( Downs and Davies , 1993 ) : E6 . 5 , E6 . 75 , E7 . 0 , E7 . 25 and E7 . 5 embryos corresponding to early streak , mid - streak , mid to late streak , early allantoic bud and late allantoic bud stages , respectively . Histological staining Whole embryos and cultured explants were histologically stained as described previously ( Ciruna and Rossant , 2001 ) . Primary antibodies were applied at the following concentrations : 10 m g / ml for rat anti - E - cadherin ( ECCD - 2 ) ( Takara Shuzo ) , 3 . 0 m g / ml for rat anti - Flk1 ( AVAS12 ) ( Kataoka et al . , 1997 ) and at a 1 : 1000 dilution for rabbit anti - PGC7 ( Sato et al . , 2002 ) . The appropriate species - speciﬁc ﬂuorophore - labeled secondary antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) were applied at a 1 : 200 dilution . Nuclei were stained with TOTO - 3 iodide ( Molecular Probes ) at a 1 : 500 dilution in the presence of 100 m g / ml of RNase A . Staining was examined using a confocal microscope ( Leica ) . Specimens were stained with alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) after immunostaining as described ( Donovan et al . , 1986 ) . Dissection of embryos and explant culture Embryos were dissected out from decidua and then Reichert’s membrane and visceral endoderm were mechanically removed using ﬁne forceps and a tungsten needle to isolate epiblasts or extra - embryonic mesoderm ( Hogan et al . , 1994 ) . The proximal quarter of epiblasts was dissected at E6 . 5 and E6 . 75 as proximal epiblasts . To isolate extra - embryonic mesoderm at E6 . 75 and E7 . 0 , boundaries of extra - embryonic mesoderm , extra - embryonic ectoderm and epiblast were cut with a tungsten needle . We also isolated the base of allantoic buds as extra - embryonic mesoderm at E7 . 25 and E7 . 5 . The fragments of extra - embryonic mesoderm were dissociated into single cells by gentle pipetting in 0 . 025 % trypsin / 0 . 75 mM EDTA . Extra - embryonic mesoderm explants were co - cultured with 200 m g / ml of ECCD - 1 , a blocking antibody for E - cadherin , or with the same concentration of ECCD - 2 as a control . Explants were cultured on a feeder layer of STO ﬁbroblast cells as described previously ( Yoshimizu et al . , 2001 ) . Time - lapse analysis Time - lapse images were analyzed using a Leica confocal microscope equipped with a cell culture chamber . Images were captured every hour for 40 hours . Results PGC precursors are located within the extra - embryonic mesoderm To determine the mechanisms of germ cell determination in mice , we initially attempted to locate PGC precursors in early streak embryos by explant culture . At E6 . 5 , explants of proximal epiblast gave rise to PGCs expressing alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and a more speciﬁc marker , PGC7 / stella ( Sato et al . , 2002 ; Saitou et al . , 2002 ) , whereas E6 . 75 explants did not ( Table 1 and Fig . 1A - D ) . These ﬁndings suggested that PGC precursors migrated out of the proximal epiblast between E6 . 5 and E6 . 75 . Because ALP - positive ( Ginsberg et al . , 1990 ) and PGC7 / stella - positive ( Sato et al . , 2002 ; Saitou et al . , 2002 ) PGCs appear ﬁrst in the extra - embryonic mesoderm at E7 . 25 , and fragilis / mil - 1 ( Saitou et al . , 2002 ; Tanaka and Matsui , 2002 ) , which seems to be expressed in PGC precursors , is expressed in the earlier ( E6 . 75 ) extra - embryonic mesoderm , we cultured fragments of isolated extra - embryonic mesoderm from E6 . 75 embryos under the same conditions . All of these explants gave rise to PGCs , indicating that PGC precursors are located within the extra - embryonic mesoderm at E6 . 75 ( Table 1 , Fig . 1E ) . Cell - cell interaction among the precursors is necessary for PGC allocation We reported that Oct4 ( GOF18 - deltaPE ) - GFP transgenic embryos speciﬁcally expressed GFP in PGCs after E8 . 0 ( Yoshimizu et al . , 1999 ) . Although GFP is also weakly expressed in somatic tissues before this stage , the E6 . 75 - E7 . 25 extra - embryonic mesoderm expressed more GFP than anywhere else in the embryo , suggesting that cell populations containing PGC precursors can be distinguished by intense GFP signals ( Fig . 2 ) . Explants of E6 . 75 extra - embryonic mesoderm of the transgenic embryos did indeed express high levels of GFP , and ALP - positive , PGC7 / stella - positive PGCs migrated from a cluster of intensely GFP - positive cells after culture ( Fig . 3 ) , further indicating that intense GFP expression in the extra - embryonic mesoderm marks a cell population that includes forming PGCs . The intensely GFP - expressing cells formed clusters within the explants before the PGCs started migration ( Fig . 3B - D and Supplemental data : http : / / dev . biologists . org / supplemental ) . In addition , the cell clusters were formed at 9 hours in culture , but cells were not PGC7 positive until 12 hours in culture ( Fig . 7 ; data not shown ) , suggesting that cell contact is important in PGC formation before commitment . To test the requirement for cell - cell Development 130 ( 26 ) Research article Fig . 1 . Localization of PGC precursor cells in early streak embryos .

BMP4 stimulates PGC formation from E6 . 5 proximal epiblasts ( unpublished results ) . ALP - and PGC7 / stella - positive PGCs developed from E6 . 5 explants ( B , C , arrowheads ) , but no such cells emerged from E6 . 75 explants ( D ) . The same group of cells is shown in B and C . E6 . 75 extra - embryonic mesoderm generated ALP - positive PGCs ( E ) . Scale bar : 160 m m ( A , D , E ) and 100 m m ( B , C ) . 6425 Cadherin regulates germ cell determination interaction , we cultured extra - embryonic mesoderm of E6 . 75 and E7 . 5 embryos after dissociating the cells by trypsinization . No PGCs were evident in the dissociated E6 . 75 explants ( Table 2 ) . The frequency of PGC formation gradually increased from E6 . 75 to E7 . 5 , when 100 % of the dissociated explants gave rise to PGCs ( Table 2 , Fig . 4 ) , suggesting an early requirement for cell contact that is relieved by E7 . 5 . Trypan Blue staining showed that over 80 % of both E6 . 75 and E7 . 25 cells survived after trypsinization . In addition , the total number of cells after culture , determined by culturing embryos ubiquitously expressing GFP , was 86 - 90 % of the number of plated cells , and no difference was found between E6 . 75 and E7 . 25 cells . Thus , the rates of cell survival at E6 . 75 and E7 . 25 in vitro were identical . Together , these results suggest that close cell - cell interaction around E6 . 75 is critical for PGC differentiation from extra - embryonic mesoderm . E - cadherin expressed in the precursors is critical for PGC allocation We examined which molecules mediate PGC formation that is cell - interaction dependent . While searching for candidates among cell adhesion proteins , we found that the expression proﬁle of E - cadherin was unique ( Saitou et al . , 2002 ) . E - cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule that is involved in many aspects of development , including organogenesis and cell differentiation ( Takeichi , 1991 ; Gumbiner , 1996 ; Laprise et al . , 2002 ) . Although E - cadherin expression in early streak embryos is high in the epiblast but undetectable in the mesoderm ( Damjanov et al . , 1986 ) , we found intense expression at E6 . 75 in a proximal region of the extra - embryonic mesoderm adjacent to the epiblast ( Fig . 5B ) , and expression was localized to the sites of cell contact . E - cadherin expression was not , however detected in the more distal part of the extra - embryonic mesoderm , which was developing into the allantois ( Fig . 5B ) . By E7 . 0 , cells that might be PGC precursors and that expressed more intense GFP , formed a cluster in the most distal region of the extra - embryonic mesoderm expressing E - cadherin ( Fig . 2F ) . This suggested that E - cadherin is involved in clustering PGC precursors . PGC7 / stella was not expressed in these cells , Table 1 .

Scale bar : 200 m m ( A - C ) ; 25 m m ( D - F ) . 6426 indicating that PGCs had not yet differentiated from precursors at E7 . 0 ( Fig . 5E - H , data not shown ) . Similar expression proﬁles persisted at E7 . 25 , when PGC7 / stella - positive PGCs were obvious among cells expressing E - cadherin ( Fig . 5I - L ) . Therefore , E - cadherin expression appears to deﬁne the cell population containing nascent PGCs within the extra - embryonic mesoderm . To determine the role of E - cadherin , we tested the effect of an E - cadherin - blocking antibody on PGC formation in culture ( Yoshida - Noro et al . , 1984 ) . We cultured fragments of extra - embryonic mesoderm from E6 . 75 embryos with or without the blocking antibody , ECCD - 1 . In the absence of antibody ( Fig . 6A - D ) or in the presence of the control antibody , ECCD - 2 ( Fig . 6I - L ) , a cluster of PGCs expressing Oct4 - GFP and PGC7 / stella formed within explants after 15 hours in culture , but not with ECCD - 1 ( Fig . 6E - H ) . Although cells often expressed very high levels of GFP in cultured explants in the presence of ECCD - 1 , they were PGC7 negative ( Fig . 6E - G ) . These cells may be PGC precursors that failed to commit to a PGC fate . A cluster of PGCs that speciﬁcally expressed E - cadherin after culture ( Fig . 6M - P ) resembled PGCs in the extra - embryonic mesoderm at E7 . 25 in vivo ( Fig . 5I - L ) . In addition , a cluster of PGC precursors expressing GFP that were negative for PGC7 / stella formed as early as 9 - 10 hours in culture , and the cluster also speciﬁcally expressed E - cadherin ( Fig . 7 ) . This suggests that E - cadherin plays an essential role in clustering PGC precursors before they become committed to PGCs , and that PGC speciﬁcation is achieved by E - cadherin - mediated cell - cell interaction among the precursors , but not between the precursors and their neighboring somatic cells . In contrast to its effect on PGC formation , ECCD - 1 did not prevent the expression of Flk1 , a marker of extra - embryonic mesoderm and allantois ( Kataoka et al . , 1997 ) ( Fig . 8 ) . One report has indicated that Flk1 is not expressed in E6 . 75 extra - embryonic mesoderm ( Yamaguchi et al . , 1993 ) , and we conﬁrmed that Flk1 expression was undetectable in the explant before culture ( data not shown ) , indicating that differentiation of extra - embryonic mesoderm progressed in culture in the presence of ECCD - 1 . These results indicate that blocking E - cadherin function inhibits PGC formation , but does not affect the differentiation of extra - embryonic mesoderm cells . After 48 - 60 hours in culture , ECCD - 1 - dependent PGC formation was still inhibited in E6 . 75 explants , while E7 . 25 explants were not affected ( Table 3 , Fig . 9 ) , consistent with the conclusion from the cell dissociation Development 130 ( 26 ) Research article Fig . 3 .

Discussion Cell lineage analyses of pre - and early streak epiblast cells have indicated that PGCs and extra - embryonic mesoderm such as allantois originate from common precursors located within the proximal epiblast ( Lawson and Hage , 1994 ) . The expression proﬁles of fragilis / mil - 1 ( Saitou et al . , 2002 ; Tanaka and Matsui , 2002 ) and Oct4 - GFP ( Yoshimizu et al . , 1999 ) as well as our culture experiments ( Table 1 ) suggest that these precursor cells migrate to and remain in a region at the posterior of embryos by E6 . 75 . Our present results indicate that E - cadherin - mediated interactions among such common precursor cells regulate their fates and are necessary for their commitment to the germ cell lineage ( Fig . 10 ) . We also examined the involvement of other cell surface molecules in PGC speciﬁcation . We focused on the Notch family proteins because they regulate cell - type speciﬁcation and differentiation in many different species via interaction with their ligands , the Delta family of proteins that are Development 130 ( 26 ) Research article Fig . 7 .

Four Notch genes ( Notch1 - 4 ) have been identiﬁed in mice and we found by whole - mount in situ hybridization that only Notch1 and Notch2 were uniformly expressed in epiblasts at E6 . 5 ( data not shown ) . However , not all of the Notch genes were expressed in extra - embryonic mesoderm at E7 . 0 ( Williams et al . , 1995 ) ( data not shown ) . In addition , we examined abnormalities of PGC development in homozygous Notch1 and Notch2 mutant embryos by whole mount ALP staining , but the numbers and localization of PGCs in the homozygous embryos did not signiﬁcantly differ from those of the heterozygous and wild type littermates at E8 . 5 . Taken together , we concluded that Notch signaling does not function in PGC development . However , the possibility of redundancy in Notch1 and Notch2 functions cannot be ruled out , as in the roles they play in left - right asymmetry determination ( Krebs et al . , 2003 ) . Several mechanisms by which E - cadherin regulates PGC determination are possible . The simplest model is that E - cadherin itself transmits instructive signals for PGC determination . For example , homophilic interactions of E - cadherin transmit intracellular signals by sequestering b - catenin from lymphoid enhancer factor / T cell factor ( LEF / TCF ) ( Hecht and Kemler , 2000 ) transcription factors ( Orsulic et al . , 1999 ) . E - cadherin might also facilitate the clustering of signaling molecules with growth factor receptors that are speciﬁcally expressed within the cluster . For instance , VE - cadherin in endothelial cells forms a complex consisting of b - catenin , PI 3 - kinase and VEGF receptor 2 , by which VEGF - A activates Akt ( Carmeliet et al . , 1999 ) . E - cadherin also stimulates the MAPK pathway through ligand - independent activation of EGFR in epithelial cells ( Pece et al . , 2000 ) . Because PI 3 - kinase is also involved in E - cadherin - dependent activation of MAPK ( Pece et al . , 1999 ; Laprise et al . , 2002 ) , we examined its involvement in PGC formation by adding the potent PI 3 - kinase inhibitors , LY294002 and wortmanin to cultured E6 . 75 extra - embryonic mesoderm . However , PGC formation was not signiﬁcantly affected ( data not shown ) . This indicates that E - cadherin - mediated signals are transmitted to PGC precursors via different signaling pathways . Fragilis / mil - 1 ( Saitou et al . , 2002 ; Tanaka and Matsui , 2002 ) is likely to be associated with E - cadherin in signal transmission . Fragilis / mil - 1 is speciﬁcally expressed in a cell population in the extra - embryonic mesoderm and in newly formed PGCs , and encodes a transmembrane protein . A role in cell - cell interaction thus seems likely for fragilis / mil - 1 , although clariﬁcation of its functions await further study . Alternatively , E - cadherin might play more permissive roles in transmitting signals for PGC determination . E - cadherin may simply permit close enough contact for other independent instructive signals such as juxtacrine signals or signals via other adhesion molecules including Fragilis / Mil - 1 . In this regard , E - cadherin could also function as an anchor that settles precursor cells within niches for PGC differentiation . Cell adhesion mediated by DE - cadherin is required in the Drosophila ovary to anchor germline stem cells in niches for their renewal ( Song et al . , 2002 ) . In mouse extra - embryonic mesoderm , E - cadherin expression is restricted to the proximal region that is adjacent to the epiblast , which also expresses E - cadherin , and is not expressed in the distal portion of extra - embryonic mesoderm or in the allantois ( Fig . 5B , F , J ) . This spatial distribution of E - cadherin prompts the notion that homophilic E - cadherin interactions prevent precursors from moving to the distal part of the extra - embryonic mesoderm , where the allantois differentiates ( Downs and Bertler , 2000 ) . The continuous expression of E - cadherin in the proximal extra - embryonic mesoderm might thus protect PGC precursors from allantois differentiation ( Fig . 10 ) .

In contrast , some cells continuously expressing E - cadherin form clusters and E - cadherin - mediated cell signaling directs them to germ cell fate . exee , extra - embryonic ectoderm . 6430 The present study provides evidence for the importance of E - cadherin - mediated cell interaction in germ cell determination . Signaling molecules that depend on E - cadherin function should be identiﬁed . The identiﬁcation of such molecules will further increase understanding of the process of germ cell determination and help to identify novel germ cell determinants .
