Vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) 3 are essential for vessel repair and , via their secretome , are able to invade from the vessel media into 4 the intima to mediate ECM remodelling . Accumulation of fibronectin ( FN ) is a hallmark of early 5 vascular repair and atherosclerosis and here we show that FN stimulates VSMCs to secrete small 6 extracellular vesicles ( sEVs ) by activating the β 1 integrin / FAK / Src pathway as well as Arp2 / 3 - 7 dependent branching of the actin cytoskeleton . Spatially , sEV were secreted via filopodia - like cellular 8 protrusions at the leading edge of migrating cells . We found that sEVs are trapped by the ECM in 9 vitro and colocalise with FN in symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques in vivo . Functionally , ECM - 10 trapped sEVs induced the formation of focal adhesions ( FA ) with enhanced pulling forces at the 11 cellular periphery . Proteomic and GO pathway analysis revealed that VSMC - derived sEVs display a 12 cell adhesion signature and are specifically enriched with collagen VI . In vitro assays identified 13 collagen VI as playing the key role in cell adhesion and invasion . Taken together our data suggests 14 that the accumulation of FN is a key early event in vessel repair acting to promote secretion of 15 collage VI enriched sEVs by VSMCs . These sEVs stimulate migration and invasion by triggering 16 peripheral focal adhesion formation and actomyosin contraction to exert sufficient traction forces to 17 enable VSMC movement within the complex vascular ECM network . 18 19 20 4 Introduction . 1 The healthy arterial vasculature is dominated by a highly organised medial extracellular matrix ( ECM ) 2 containing organised layers of contractile vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) . Vascular 3 pathologies such as atherosclerosis are associated with dramatic remodelling of the ECM ultimately 4 leading to plaque rupture and myocardial infarction or stroke 1 . Progenitor medial VSMCs are 5 essential for vessel repair and must invade through the ECM to form the protective intimal fibrous 6 cap in the plaque . This process of VSMC invasion actively contributes to ECM remodelling 2 - 4 . The 7 accumulation of liver - derived fibronectin ( FN ) in the vasculature is an early biomarker of 8 atherosclerotic plaque formation and conditional FN knockout in the liver blocked VSMC invasion 9 and fibrous cap formation in the ApoE mouse model . This suggests that FN is an essential signal for 10 VSMC recruitment and invasion during vascular repair , yet its exact role remains unknown 5 - 7 . 11 FN has been shown to play key signalling roles by modulating cellular spreading , adhesion , invasion , 12 differentiation and viability during both developmental and pathological processes 8 . Cell adhesion to 13 FN is primarily mediated by α 5 β 1 integrins and proteoglycans acting together to activate small GTP - 14 binding proteins , Cdc42 , Rac1 , and Rho which in turn induce branched actin cytoskeletal 15 rearrangements to form cellular membrane protrusions , filopodia and lamellipodia , which are 16 attached to the ECM via transient peripheral focal complexes 8 - 11 . In turn , maturation of focal 17 complexes into focal adhesions ( FAs ) anchors cytoplasmic actin stress fibers to the ECM and actin 18 polymerisation and actomyosin - mediated contractility generate the traction forces required for cell 19 body locomotion 12 , 13 . 20 Exosome - like small extracellular vesicles ( sEVs ) are novel , cell - matrix crosstalk entities that decorate 21 the ECM and form “migration paths” for tumour cells by enhancing cell adhesion , motility and 22 directionality 14 - 17 . Mechanistically , sEVs are secreted at the cellular leading edge and promote FA 23 formation by presenting fibronectin ( FN ) 14 , 15 , 18 , 19 . In addition , sEVs can stimulate motility of 24 immune cells and Dictyostelium discoideum by presenting cytokines and / or generating 25 chemoattractants 20 - 22 . We recently showed that FN is also enriched in VSMC - derived sEVs but the 26 exact role of sEVs in VSMC migration and invasion within the ECM meshwork environment of the 27 vasculature remains unexplored 23 . 28 Here we report that FN in the ECM induces polarized sEV secretion via filopodia by upregulating β1 29 integrin / FAK / Src and Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched actin pathways . In turn , sEVs promote VSMC 30 migration in a 2D model and enhanced directed cell invasion in a 3D model . Mechanistically sEVs 31 induced formation of focal adhesions ( FA ) with enhanced pulling forces at the cellular periphery thus 32 switching the leading edge from protrusion activity into contractile mode to enable cell body 33 propulsion . Importantly , we found that that the sEV cargo , collagen VI , is indispensable for triggering 34 FA formation and directed cell invasion . We hypothesize that sEV - triggered peripheral FA formation 35 anchors the cellular leading edge and activates cell contraction to exert sufficient force to allow 36 VSMC invasion into the complex ECM fiber meshwork . This novel mechanism opens a unique 37 therapeutic opportunity to target specifically VSMC invasion activity during vascular repair and 38 restenosis . 39 40 41 5 Results . 1 1 . ECM components involved in vessel injury repair stimulate sEV release via b1 integrins . 2 FN is detectable in the vasculature as early as the fatty streak stage and preceding major atherogenic 3 alterations such as neointima formation and it is also a novel marker for symptomatic carotid 4 plaques 5 - 7 . Given its presence during early stages of vessel injury we hypothesized that FN may 5 modulate sEV secretion to enable vessel repair . FN is secreted as a monomeric protein forming 6 fibrils upon cellular binding so we compared the effects of monomeric FN with the effects of FN 7 immobilised on tissue culture plates to mimic FN fibrils 8 . Plating VSMCs on immobilised FN 8 increased the release of CD63 + / CD81 + sEVs 3 . 5 ± 0 . 6 fold whilst addition of soluble FN had no effect 9 on EV secretion as detected by CD63 - bead capture assay ( Fig . 1A ) . Fibrillar collagen I but not a non - 10 fibrillar laminin also stimulated secretion of CD63 + / CD81 + sEVs by VSMCs to the same extent as FN 11 ( Fig . S1A ) . 12 We next tested if the native VSMC - derived 3D matrix that contains FN and collagen could modulate 13 sEV secretion 24 . VSMCs were induced to produce ECM , cells were removed and fresh VSMCs plated 14 onto these 3D matrices . VSMCs acquired an elongated shape ( Figs . 1B and 1C ) which is typical for 15 mesenchymal cells in a 3D environment 24 and increased secretion of CD63 + / CD81 + sEVs compared 16 to VSMCs plated onto the non - coated plastic ( Fig 1D ) . We observed no changes in the size 17 distribution of sEVs secreted by VSMCs plated either on plastic or FN matrix as detected using 18 Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis ( NTA ) ( Fig 1E ) . To further characterise the EV populations released 19 western blotting confirmed that sEVs isolated in both conditions were loaded with similar levels of 20 FN and the sEV - specific markers CD63 and Syntenin - 1 and lacked the EV - specific marker , α - actinin - 4 21 ( Fig 1F ) 25 . In addition , treatment of the cells plated onto the matrix with sphingomyelin 22 phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor ( 3 - O - Methyl - Sphingomyelin , 3 - OMS ) revealed that CD63 + / CD81 + sEV 23 secretion in response to collagen and FN was regulated by sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 ( Fig 24 S1B ) which regulates sEV generation in multivesicular bodies 26 . Hence , FN triggers secretion of 25 CD63 + / CD81 + sEVs , most likely with a late endosomal origin . 26 Both collagen I and FN are ECM ligands that bind and transduce intracellular signalling via β 1 27 integrin . Therefore , we explored the effect of β1 integrin activating ( 12G10 ) or inhibiting antibodies 28 ( 4B4 ) on FN - stimulated secretion of CD63 + / CD81 + sEVs . Activation of β 1 integrin using 12G10 29 antibody in VSMCs enhanced the effect of FN on sEV secretion ( Fig 1G ) . Inhibition of β 1 integrin 30 using the 4B4 antibody blocked CD63 + / CD81 + sEV secretion by VSMCs plated on FN ( Fig . 1G ) . Next , 31 we tested the role of the β 1 integrin downstream signalling mediators , FAK and Src 27 . Blocking these 32 pathways with small inhibitors ( FAM14 and PP2 , respectively ) reduced sEV secretion by cells plated 33 on FN but not on plastic ( Figs . 1H and 1I ) . Taken together these data suggest that FN matrices 34 stimulate secretion of CD63 + / CD81 + sEVs via the β 1 integrin signalling pathway . 35 36 2 . sEV secretion depends on the branched actin cytoskeleton and occurs via filopodia 37 As β 1 integrin regulates the actin cytoskeleton we next tested whether the actin cytoskeleton 38 contributes to FN - induced sEV secretion . Filopodia are finger - like extensions of the plasma 39 membrane that contain a core of bundled actin filaments and these structures play key roles in ECM 40 sensing and cellular invasion 28 . To examine the contribution of filopodia to sEV secretion we treated 41 VSMCs with the formin inhibitor , SMIFH2 that blocks filopodia formation . Inhibition of filopodia 42 formation reduced sEV secretion by VSMCs plated on FN but not plastic indicating this was a specific 43 mechanism stimulated by FN ( Fig . 2A ) . In addition to formins , regulators of branched actin filaments , 44 6 Cortactin and Arp2 / 3 , have been implicated in filopodia formation and sEV secretion by tumour cells 1 18 , 29 , 30 . Inhibition of Arp2 / 3 using the drug CK666 reduced sEV secretion both in VSMCs plated on 2 plastic and FN matrix ( Fig . 2B ) . Branched actin is involved in sEV secretion by regulating the docking 3 of multivesicular bodies to the plasma membrane in tumour cells 30 . To understand the role of 4 branched actin in sEV secretion in VSMCs we explored the spatial distribution of sEV secretion by 5 VSMCs using CD63 - pHluorin where fluorescence is only observed upon the fusion of MVBs with the 6 plasma membrane 31 . We observed the typical “burst” - like appearance of sEV secretion at the cell - 7 ECM interface ( Fig S2A and Supplementary Video S1 ) . Notably , we also observed an intense CD63 - 8 pHluorin staining along filopodia - like structures indicating that sEV release can occur in filopodia ( Fig 9 S2A and Supplemental Video S1 ) . To test whether MVBs are delivered to filopodia , we stained 10 VSMCs for the filopodia marker , Myosin - 10 ( Myo10 ) 32 and observed the presence of endogenous 11 CD63 + MVBs along the Myo10 - positive filopodia ( Fig . 2C , arrows ) . Filopodia have been implicated in 12 sEV capture and delivery to endocytosis “hot - spots” 33 , so next we examined the directionality of 13 CD63 + MVB movement in filopodia by overexpressing Myo10 - GFP and CD63 - RFP in live VSMCs . 14 Importantly , we observed anterograde MVB transport toward the filopodia tip ( Fig . 2D and 15 Supplemental Video S2 ) indicative of MVB’s secretion . 16 To test the functional role of Arp2 / 3 in the sEV secretion pathway , we overexpressed the Arp2 / 3 17 subunit , ARPC2 - GFP and the F - actin marker , F - tractin - RFP in live VSMCs . As expected , Arp2 / 3 and F - 18 actin formed a distinct lamellipodia scaffold ( Fig . S2B and Supplementary Video S3 ) . We also 19 observed Arp2 / 3 and F - actin positive vesicle movement through the VSMC cytoplasm ( Fig . S2B , 20 arrow , and Supplementary Video S3 ) suggesting that Arp2 / 3 - driven actin comet tails are involved in 21 intracellular trafficking . Indeed , intracellular parasites engage Arp2 / 3 - driven actin comet tails for 22 propulsion through the cell cytosol and to spread through the cellular filopodia to neighbouring 23 cells 34 , 35 . Therefore , we tested if Arp2 / 3 - driven actin comet tails propel MVBs through the cell . To do 24 this we expressed CD63 - GFP in live VSMCs to label MVBs and observed MVB propulsion by the F - 25 actin tail ( Fig . 2E and Supplementary Video S4 ) . 26 Altogether these data show that activation of a β 1 integrin - specific pathway by the FN matrix 27 induces sEV secretion by VSMCs . Spatially , sEV secretion occurs at VSMC filopodia - like protrusion 28 sites and is assisted by the branched actin network suggesting that sEVs may be tightly involved in 29 the regulation of cell motility and invasion . 30 3 . sEVs are trapped in ECM In Vitro and in atherosclerotic plaque . 31 EV trapping in the ECM is a prominent feature of the vessel media and intima and EVs become more 32 abundant in the ECM with ageing and disease 36 . Therefore , we next set out to determine if sEV can 33 be trapped in the native matrix in vitro . VSMCs were plated on plastic or FN for 24hours and sEVs 34 were visualised by CD63 immunofluorescence . We observed CD63 puncta in close proximity to 35 filopodia - like cell projectiles ( Fig 3A ) . Interestingly , these CD63 + sEVs were observed both on the 36 plastic and FN - coated plates suggesting that sEVs can bind to ECM secreted by VSMCs over the 24h 37 incubation . We also visualised CD63 + sEV trapping in the native ECM produced by VSMCs over a 7 38 day period and their reduction / absence from the matrix when VSMCs were treated with SMPD3 39 siRNA ( Fig S3 ) . 40 To understand how VSMCs interact with sEVs in the ECM we next isolated and fluorescently - labelled 41 sEVs and added them to VSMCs to track sEV distribution . Super - resolution microscopy ( iSIM ) 42 revealed that the addition of sEVs to the cell media resulted in fast uptake by VSMCs and their 43 localization at the nuclear periphery ( Fig 3B and Fig S3B ) . This was particularly obvious in 3D 44 projections ( Fig S3B ) . Next , sEVs were added to FN - coated plates prior to the addition of VSMCs . 45 7 This resulted in the sEVs remaining evenly deposited across the ECM and these immobilised EVs 1 were not internalised by cells even after incubation for 24h ( Fig 3C and Fig S3C ) . Notably , no 2 perinuclear localisation of sEVs was observed . 3 To spatially map the accumulation of sEV markers in the atherosclerotic plaque in vivo we collected 4 12 carotid atherosclerotic plaques and adjacent intact vascular segments excised during carotid 5 endarterectomy . Unbiased proteomics analysis confirmed considerable differences between these 2 6 sample groups , revealing 213 plaque - specific and 111 intact arterial - specific proteins ( Fig 4A and Fig 7 4B , Tables S1 - S5 ) . Differential expression analysis identified 46 proteins significantly overexpressed 8 ( fold change ≥ 2 and FDR - adjusted P value ≤ 0 . 05 ) in plaques and 13 proteins significantly 9 upregulated in the intact arterial segments ( Fig 4C , Table S3 ) . Among the top proteins differentially 10 expressed in plaques were catalytic lipid - associated bioscavenger paraoxonase 1 , atherogenic 11 apolipoprotein B - 100 , HDL - associated apolipoprotein D , iron - associated protein haptoglobin , and 12 inflammation - related matrix metalloproteinase - 9 ( Table S3 ) . These proteins have previously been 13 implicated in lipid metabolism alterations as well as inflammation in the plaque hence indicating the 14 advanced atherosclerotic plaque signature of the analysed samples . Comparison of the differentially 15 expressed proteins also revealed an accumulation in atherosclerotic regions of fetuin - A ( Alpha - 2 - HS - 16 glycoprotein , P02765 , 2 . 7 fold increase , p = 0 . 003869659 ) , an abundant sEV cargo protein which is 17 recycled by VSMCs . Likewise , the level of another sEV cargo , Apolipoprotein B - 100 ( P04114 ) was also 18 significantly elevated ( 2 . 8 fold increase , p = 0 . 000124446 ) in atherosclerotic plaque ( Table S2 ) 23 . 19 Notably , a negative regulator of sEV secretion , Coronin 1C ( Q9ULV4 ) was downregulated in the 20 plaque ( 0 . 6 fold decrease , p = 0 . 000805372 , Table S2 ) consistent with previous studies that suggest 21 sEV secretion is upregulated during plaque progression 36 , 37 . 22 To test if FN associates with sEV markers in atherosclerosis , we investigated the spatial association 23 of FN with sEV markers using the sEV - specific marker CD81 . Interestingly , FN accumulated both in 24 the neointima and the tunica media where it was significantly colocalised with CD81 ( Fig . 4E , 4F and 25 4G ) . Notably CD81 and FN colocalization was particularly prominent in cell - free , matrix - rich plaque 26 regions ( Figs . 4F and 4G ) . Western blot analysis confirmed FN accumulation in the plaque region 27 ( Figs 4G , S4A , S4B ) . To understand the origin of plaque FN we performed RT - PCR . FN expression 28 could not be detected in plaques nor in intact vessels , although it was abundant in the liver ( data not 29 shown ) , suggesting that the circulation is a key source of FN in atherosclerotic plaques . To test 30 whether circulating FN can be recycled in sEVs and subsequently deposited we treated primary 31 human aortic VSMCs with FN and found that it was endocytosed and subsequently delivered to early 32 and late endosomes together with fetuin A , another abundant sEV cargo elevated in plaques ( Figs 33 S4C and S4D ) . In addition , FN could be co - purified with sEVs from VSMC conditioned media ( Fig S4E ) 34 and detected on the surface of sEVs by flow cytometry confirming its loading in , and secretion via , 35 sEVs ( Fig 4H ) . 36 4 . sEVs stimulate VSMC migration and invasion and induce peripheral focal adhesions with 37 enhanced pulling force at the leading edge . 38 FN as a cargo in sEVs promotes FA formation in tumour cells and increases cell speed 14 , 15 . As we 39 found that FN is loaded into VSMC - derived sEVs we hypothesized that ECM - entrapped sEVs can 40 enhance cell migration by increasing cell adhesion and FA formation in the context of a FN - rich ECM . 41 Therefore , we tested the effect of sEV deposition onto the FN matrix on VSMC migration in 2D and 42 3D models . We found that FN coating and the addition of sEVs promoted VSMC velocity and overall 43 migration distance in a 2D single - cell migration model ( Figs . 5A , 5B ) in agreement with previous 44 studies using tumour cells 14 , 15 . In contrast , inhibition of sEV release with 3 - OMS had the opposite 45 effect on VSMC velocity and overall migration distance ( Figs . 5A , 5B ) . 46 8 To assess the effect of sEVs on cell directionality we exploited a 3D model developed by Sung et al 15 1 and examined VSMC invasion using a μ - Slide Chemotaxis assay where cells were embedded into FN - 2 enriched 3D Matrigel matrices in the absence or presence of exogenously - added sEVs ( Fig . 5C ) . We 3 developed a script to automatically measure cell invasion parameters ( track length , cell speed , 4 straightness , accumulated distance , lateral and vertical displacement and parallel forward motion 5 index ( FMI ) ) . The addition of sEVs had no effect on cell speed , accumulated distance or straightness 6 ( Figs . 5D , 5E , 5F ) . However , VSMCs invading in the presence of embedded sEVs migrated more 7 aligned to the FBS gradient compared to cells plated in the absence of sEVs . To test whether this was 8 a feature of all EV populations we also performed the experiment in the presence of larger EVs 9 pelleted at the 10 , 000x g centrifugation step and observed no effect suggesting this mechanism was 10 specific to sEVs ( Figs . 5G and 5H ) . 11 We wondered whether it was the FN cargo in sEVs that was promoting VSMC migration by 12 enhancing FA assembly and cellular adhesion to FN similar to sEV in cancer cells 14 . Therefore , we 13 measured VSMC adhesion to FN using an adhesion assay where sEVs were added to FN - coated 14 plates and cells were plated onto these matrices for 1h and firmly attached cells counted . 15 Surprisingly we observed a marked reduction of VSMC adhesion to FN in the presence of sEVs ( Fig 16 6A ) suggesting that sEV can impair VSMC adhesion . Mesenchymal cell attachment to the matrix is 17 mediated by transient focal complexes present in the cellular protrusion as well as centripetal FAs 18 that link the cellular cytoskeleton to the matrix 12 , 13 . Consistent with this we observed both focal 19 complexes in the cellular protrusion as well as more centripetal FAs associated with mature actin 20 stress fibres in VSMCs on FN matrix ( Fig S5A ) . Therefore , we used a live cell spreading assay to 21 monitor cellular adhesion over time using ACEA’s xCELLigence . As expected , FN alone stimulated 22 VSMC spreading and adhesion ( Figs . 6B and 6C ) . Addition of sEVs did not impact cellular adhesion 23 over the first ∼ 15 min but then the adhesion was stalled in the presence of sEVs ( Fig 6B and 6C ) 24 suggesting some defect in further cellular spreading . Again , to test whether this was specific for the 25 sEV subset , we also tested the effect of larger EVs pelleted at 10 , 000x g and found that these EVs 26 had no effect on VSMC adhesion and spreading onto the FN matrix ( Fig 6B and 6C ) . To interrogate 27 the stalling event induced by sEVs in VSMCs we plated cells and counted the number of FAs , average 28 size as well as distance from the cell periphery after 30 mins using TIRF microscopy . Once again 29 plating VSMCs onto FN increased the cell size , number of FAs as well as the number of centripetal 30 FAs as compared to cells spreading over non - coated plastic ( Figs 6E - I ) . Importantly , addition of sEVs 31 to FN significantly reduced the number of FAs and the newly formed FAs were formed in close 32 proximity to the cell periphery ( Figs . 6E and 6F ) . Interestingly , the average FA size was similar 33 between the various conditions ( Fig 5I ) . 34 Cellular traction force is generated by the FA gradient upon FA turnover - formation at the leading 35 edge and disassembly at the tail 12 , 13 , 38 . To test if sEVs can influence FA turnover in migrating VSMCs 36 we examined FA turnover in the presence of sEVs . Adhesion sites were visualised by paxillin - RFP 37 reporter expression and the FA turnover index was calculated by counting FA overlap over time 38 using a previously developed algorithm to track individual focal adhesions ( Fig S5B ) 39 . Interestingly , 39 the FA turnover index remains the same in the presence of sEVs indicating that FA stability was not 40 altered ( 6J ) . These data correlate well with no changes observed in FA average size across various 41 conditions ( Fig 6I ) and indicate that sEVs are not influencing FA assembly or “life - cycle” directly . Rho - 42 dependent activation of actomyosin contractility stabilises FAs by mechanical forces halting 43 fibroblast spreading onto FN 40 , 41 . We hypothesized that sEVs trigger the appearance of pre - mature , 44 peripheral FAs by activating Rho - dependent cellular contractility . To test whether sEVs can 45 modulate mature FA contractility we measured individual traction force which is generated by 46 mature adhesion sites in the absence or presence of sEVs ( Fig . S5C ) . VSMCs transfected with paxillin - 47 9 RFP were plated on FN and sEV - covered PDMS pillars and pillar displacements were calculated as 1 previously described 42 - 44 . Importantly , the traction force was increased in the presence of sEVs ( Fig 2 6K ) . Altogether these data suggest that sEVs can trigger the formation of FAs with enhanced pulling 3 force at the cell periphery . 4 5 . The sEV cargo Collagen VI regulates focal adhesion formation in VSMCs 5 To identify the components triggering peripheral FA formation we compared the proteomic 6 composition of sEVs with the larger EV fraction , which had no effect on FA formation . We identified 7 257 proteins in sEVs and 168 proteins in EVs with 142 proteins common between both datasets ( Fig 8 7A , Tables S6 - S8 , Fig S6A ) . Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the top 5 clusters were 9 related to cell migration - ECM organization , movement of cell or subcellular component , cell 10 adhesion , leukocyte migration and cell - cell adhesion ( Fig 7B , Fig S6B , Table S8 ) . The cell adhesion 11 cluster included collagen VI ( chains COL1A1 , COL6A2 and COL6A3 ) , extracellular matrix glycoproteins 12 ( FN and thrombospondin , THBS2 , THBS1 ) as well as EGF - like repeat and discoidin I - like domain - 13 containing protein ( EDIL3 ) and transforming growth factor - beta - induced protein ig - h3 ( TGFBI ) ( Fig 14 7B , Fig S6B , Table S8 ) . Notably , these sEV proteins are predominantly involved in cell - matrix 15 interactions and cellular adhesion . LG3BP which regulates cell motility was also presented 16 exclusively in sEVs ( Table S6 ) . These cell adhesion modulating proteins including Collagen VI , TGFBI , 17 EDIL and LG3BP were either uniquely or highly enriched in sEVs compared to larger EVs as detected 18 by western blotting ( Fig 7C ) . 19 Collagen VI was the most abundant protein in VSMC - derived sEVs ( Fig 7B , Table S7 ) . Collagen VI was 20 previously implicated in the interaction with the proteoglycan NG2 45 and suppression of cell 21 spreading on FN 46 . To test the role of collagen VI in sEV - induced changes in VSMC spreading we 22 incubated FN - deposited sEVs with an anti - collagen VI antibody to block its interaction with the 23 proteoglycan NG2 47 . Addition of the anti - collagen VI antibody restored VSMC spreading on the FN 24 matrix as compared to non - specific IgG treatment ( Fig . 7D ) . Moreover , sEVs isolated from VSMCs 25 after collagen VI knockdown using siRNA had no effect in the 3D invasion model on cell speed ( Fig 26 7E ) or direction ( Fig . 7F ) but reduced cell alignment to the gradient as compared to VSMCs treated 27 with a scrambled siRNA control ( Fig . 7J ) . Finally , we compared the expression of collagen VI , EDIL3 28 and TGFBI between the plaque and control aorta tissues ( Table S1 ) . Importantly , collagen VI and 29 TGFBI expression were significantly elevated in the plaque ( Fig 7I ) consistent with increased 30 deposition of sEVs during disease progression . Altogether these data indicate that sEVs induce a 31 reduction in cell spreading and premature peripheral FA formation by presenting collagen VI thus 32 acting to enhance cell locomotion ( Graphical Abstract ) . 33 34 10 Discussion . 1 VSMC migration and invasion to the site of vascular injury is crucial for vessel repair as well as the 2 pathogenic development of atherosclerotic plaque , however the mechanisms of effective invasion 3 through the complex vascular ECM meshwork have been poorly studied . Here we show that FN , a 4 novel marker of unstable plaques 6 , enables VSMC migration and invasion by stimulating secretion of 5 collagen VI - loaded sEVs which decorate the ECM and stimulate FA maturation . Notably , our data are 6 consistent and extend previous reports showed that EV secretion by tumour cells enhances nascent 7 adhesion formation hence facilitating tumor cell migration and invasion 14 - 16 . In particular , we found 8 that sEVs induce formation of FAs with an enhanced pulling force at the cell periphery thus favouring 9 actomyosin - mediated contractility which is essential for cell body propulsion and locomotion . 10 Mesenchymal cell migration begins with protrusive activity at the leading edge followed by the 11 forward movement of the cell body 13 , 41 , 48 . Cell directionality is guided via the integrin β 1 “probe” on 12 the tip of cellular protrusions , filopodia and lamellipodia 49 . Cellular protrusions are attached to the 13 ECM via focal complexes and extended by the physical force generated by the branched network of 14 actin filaments beneath the plasma membrane 50 . Focal complexes either disassemble or mature into 15 the elongated centripetally located focal adhesions 40 . These focal adhesions anchor the ECM to actin 16 stress fibres and the traction force generated by actomyosin - mediated contractility pulls the FAs 17 rearward and the cell body forward 12 , 13 . Here we report that β 1 integrin activation triggers sEV 18 release via the filopodia and sEVs stimulate VSMC migration and invasion in 2D and 3D assays , 19 respectively . To gain insight into how sEVs can stimulate cell motility we explored VSMC protrusive 20 activity using live cell spreading assays and TIRF imaging . FN stimulated VSMC spreading by 21 increasing the number of FAs , which were formed centripetally from the cell plasma membrane . FN 22 decoration with sEV dramatically ceased VSMC spreading by inducing pre - mature formation of FAs 23 at the cellular periphery . Cellular spreading and adhesion are orchestrated by the Rho family of small 24 GTPases , Cdc42 , Rac1 and Rho with Cdc42 and Rac1 modulating filopodia and lamellipodia and focal 25 complex formation and Rho controlling FA maturation and actomyosin - mediated contractility 11 , 51 , 52 . 26 Interestingly , in fibroblasts Rho is specifically degraded in cellular protrusions and cellular spreading 27 on FN is accompanied by transient Rho suppression during the fast cell spreading phase 41 , 53 , 54 . This 28 phase is followed by Rho activation leading to formation of actin stress fibres , tension increase on 29 the focal complexes and their maturation into elongated centripetally located FAs 40 , 41 , 53 , 55 . Excessive 30 Rho activation leads to premature FA assembly and stress fiber formation resulting in reduced 31 cellular protrusions , inhibition of cellular spreading and motility on the FN matrix 41 , 53 , 56 - 58 Altogether 32 these data indicate that Rho activity , in mesenchymal cells with extensive FA networks such as 33 fibroblasts or VSMCs , can slow down cell migration by immobilising cells 13 . However , we found that 34 sEVs are not influencing mature FA stability . On the contrary , sEV - induced FAs were spatially 35 restricted to the cell periphery near cellular protrusions and were characterised by an enhanced 36 pulling force activity . Interestingly , fibroblast polarization is driven by Smurf1 - dependent RhoA 37 ubiquitinylation and localised degradation in cellular protrusions 54 . A recent study indicated that 38 Rho - dependent contractility is essential for cell invasion in a 3D model and it is tempting to 39 speculate that local Rho activity can enable VSMC invasion by stabilizing FAs at the leading edge and 40 stimulating actomyosin - mediated contractility and cell body movement 59 . On the other hand Rho – 41 ROCK activity is critical for the protease - independent rounded motility of tumour cells and cell types 42 with few adhesion contacts ( ameboid ) when Rho - dependent contractile forces generate hydrostatic 43 pressure forming multiple membrane blebs to invade the ECM 60 , 61 . In fact , we observed an extensive 44 secretion of sEVs which ceased protrusion activity ; also VSMCs acquired a rounded morphology 45 when “hovering” over the FN matrix decorated with sEVs ( data not shown ) . Hence , it will be 46 11 interesting to study in the future if VSMCs can “high - jack” some elements of “amoeboid - like 1 invasiveness” mode seen in tumors by secreting sEVs . 2 Collagen VI is a nonfibrillar collagen that assembles into beaded microfilaments upon secretion and 3 it plays both structural and signalling roles 62 . Interestingly , type VI collagen deposition by interstitial 4 fibroblasts is increased in the infarcted myocardium and collagen VI knockout in mice improves 5 cardiac function , structure and remodelling after myocardial infarction via unknown pathways 63 , 64 . 6 Immunohistochemical analysis showed that in the healthy vasculature collagen VI is detected in the 7 endothelial basement membrane in the intima and is also forms fibrillar structures between smooth 8 muscle cells in the media . In the fibrous plaque collagen VI is diffusely distributed throughout both 9 the fibrous cap and atheroma 65 . Curiously , treatment of ApoE - / - mice with antibodies to collagen VI 10 reduced atherosclerosis but its exact role has remained unknown 66 . We and others detected 11 Collagen VI in sEVs but its functional significance remained unknown 23 , 67 . Here we showed that 12 collagen VI is essential for early FA formation at the VSMC periphery as well as VSMC invasion in a 13 3D model . We propose that collagen VI modulates FA formation either by activating cellular 14 signalling or acting as a structural component changing local ECM stiffness 12 . Identified collagen VI 15 receptors include α 3 β 1 integrin , the cell surface proteoglycan chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan - 4 16 ( CSPG4 ; also known as NG2 ) , and the anthrax toxin receptors 1 and 2 68 - 71 . Interestingly , a novel , 17 recently identified Collagen VI signalling receptor ( CMG2 / ANTXR2 ) mediates localised Rho activation 18 upon collagen VI binding 71 , 72 . NG2 also activates the Rho / ROCK pathway leading to effective 19 amoeboid invasiveness of tumour cells which is characterised by excessive blebbing and enhanced 20 actomyosin contractility 60 , 73 . Hence , biding of collagen VI to these receptors can potentially locally 21 activate Rho and trigger FA formation and actomyosin contractility thus increasing VSMC motility 22 and directional invasiveness . Of note , it was also reported that NG2 expression is elevated in VSMCs 23 in the atherosclerotic plaque and NG2 knockout prevents plaque formation 45 , 74 . Curiously , 24 endotrophin , collagen VI α 3 chain - derived profibrotic fragment has recently been associated with a 25 higher risk of arterial stiffness and cardiovascular and all - cause death in patients with diabetes type 26 1 and atherosclerosis , respectively 75 , 76 . Hence , targeting this novel sEV - dependent mechanism of 27 VSMC invasion may open - up new therapeutic opportunities to modulate atherosclerotic plaque 28 development or even to prevent undesired VSMC motility in restenosis . 29 We also identified a positive feedback loop and showed that FN stimulates sEV secretion by VSMCs . 30 sEV secretion is a tightly regulated process which is governed by activation of signalling pathways 31 including activation of G - protein coupled receptors 31 and alterations in cytosolic calcium 77 , small 32 GTPases Rab7 , Rab27a , Rab27b and Rab35 78 , 79 , vesicular trafficking scaffold proteins including 33 syntenin 80 , sortillin 81 and CD63 82 or accumulation of ceramide 26 . We found that the fibrillar ECM 34 proteins , FN and collagen I induce sEV secretion by activating the β 1 integrin / FAK / Src and Arp2 / 3 - 35 dependent pathways . Our in vivo FN staining data are in good agreement with previous studies 36 showing accumulation of FN in late - stage plaques 6 , 7 . Moreover , we observed close co - distribution of 37 FN and CD81 in the plaque suggesting that accumulating FN matrices can stimulate sEV secretion in 38 vivo . Notably , expression of the major FN receptor , α 5 β1 integrin is re - activated upon VSMC de - 39 differentiation following vascular injury 83 . It is thought the α 5 β1 integrin mediates FN matrix 40 assembly , whilst β 3 integrins are important for cell - matrix interactions 83 , 84 . Our data sheds new light 41 on the functional role of α 5 β1 as an ECM sensor inducing production of collagen VI - loaded sEVs 42 which in turn enhance cell invasion in the complex ECM meshwork . Excessive collagen and elastin 43 matrix breakdown in atheroma has been tightly linked to acute coronary events hence it will be 44 interesting to study the possible link between sEV secretion and plaque stability as sEV - dependent 45 invasion is also likely to influence the necessary ECM degradation induced by invading cells 85 . 46 12 In summary , cooperative activation of integrin signalling and F - actin cytoskeleton pathways results in 1 strict spatiotemporal control of the secretion of sEVs controlling cell - ECM crosstalk . Further studies 2 are needed to test these mechanisms across various cell types and ECM matrices . 3 4 5 13 Materials and Methods 1 Materials 2 Proteins were fibronectin ( Cell Guidance Systems , AP - 23 ) , collagen I ( Gibco , # A1048301 ) , laminin 3 ( Roche , 11243217001 ) , Matrigel ( Corning , # 356237 ) , Phalloidin - rhodamin ( ThermoFisherScientific , 4 R415 ) .

PDMS ( Sylgard 184 , Dow Corning ) was mixed thoroughly with its 32 curing agent ( 10 : 1 ) , degassed , poured over the silicon master , placed upside - down on a plasma - 33 treated coverslip - dish ( Mattek ) , or coverslip 4 - well dishes ( Ibidi ) and cured at 80C for 2h . The mold 34 was then removed and the pillars were incubated with fibronectin for 1h at 37C , after which pillars 35 were incubated with sEVs ( 10µg / ml in PBS ) at 4°C overnight . 36 VSMC previously transfected with Paxillin - RFP by using electroporation as above were plated on the 37 Pillars and imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti - E epifluorescent microscope with a 100x 1 . 4NA objective , 38 Nikon DS - Qi2 Camera and a Solent Scientific chamber with temperature and CO 2 control . For 39 calculation of pillar displacements , a perfect grid was assumed and deviations from the grid were 40 calculated using reference pillars outside the cell . The traction stress was calculated for a 10 µm wide 41 region at the cell edge that was enriched in paxillin staining , taking into account all pillar displacements 42 above a ~ 20 nm noise level , which was calculated from pillars outside the cells . 43 44 18 The Stiffness of the pillars was calculated as described by Ghibaudo et al 44 but taking into account 1 substrate warping as described by Schoen et al ( Eq1 - 5 ) 43 : 2 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 1 : 𝑘𝑘 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 = 3 64 𝜋𝜋𝐸𝐸 𝐷𝐷 4 𝐻𝐻 3 ; 3 4 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 2 : 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 16 3 ( 𝐿𝐿 𝐷𝐷 ) 3 ( 16 3 ( 𝐿𝐿 𝐷𝐷 ) 3 + 7 + 6𝜈𝜈 3 𝐿𝐿 𝐷𝐷 + 8𝑇𝑇 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 ( 𝜈𝜈 ) ( 𝐿𝐿 𝐷𝐷 ) 2 ) ; 5 6 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 3 : 𝑇𝑇 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 ( 𝜈𝜈 ) = 𝑎𝑎 ( 1 + 𝜈𝜈 ) 2 𝜋𝜋 � 2 ( 1 − 𝜈𝜈 ) + � 1 − 1 4 ( 1 − 𝜈𝜈 ) �� 7 8 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 4 : 𝑘𝑘 = 𝑘𝑘 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 ∗ 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ; 9 10 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 5 : 𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 = 9𝑘𝑘 4𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋 ; 11 12 Protein concentration 13 Protein concentration was determined by DC protein assay ( BioRad ) . 14 Focal adhesion TIRF Imaging 15 μ - Slides ( iB idi ) were coated with FN ( 5μg / mL ) in PBS at 4°C overnight . Next , μ - Slides were gently 16 washed once with cold PBS following inc ubation with EV or sEV at 4°C overnight . The following day μ - 17 Slides were incubated with 0 . 1 % BSA in PBS for 30 minutes at 37°C to block non - specific binding sites 18 and washed with PBS three times and 250μL of M199 media supplemented with 20 % sEV - free FBS 19 was added to each well . VSMCs were incubated in M199 media supplemented with 0 . 5 % BSA 20 overnight , detached with trypsin and resuspended to 80 , 000 cells / mL in M199 supplemented with 21 20 % FBS . Cells ( 250μL ) were added to μ - Slides and were incubated for 30min at 37°C . VSMC were fixed 22 with 4 % PFA for 10 minutes at 37°C , washed with PBS three times and were permeabilised with PBS 23 supplemented with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 for 10 minutes at 37°C . Next , VSMC were washed three times 24 with PBS for 5 minutes and were incubated with 3 % BSA in PBS for 1h at room temperature . VSMC 25 were incubated with anti - vinculin antibody ( 1 : 400 ) in blocking buffer at 4°C overnight . Next , VSMC 26 were washed with PBS for 5min and incubated with secondary antibody ( 1 : 500 , AlexaFluor488 ) diluted 27 in blocking buffer for 1h at room temperature . Cells were incubated with CellMaskRed 28 ( ThermoFisherScientific ) and DAPI ( 0 . 1 mg / mL ) for 5min , washed and analysed by TIRF microscopy . 29 TIRF Microscopic images were collected on a Nikon Ti2 upright microscope with a TIRF illuminator 30 ( Nikon ) attached using a 100x oil immersion ( 1 . 49 NA ) objective lens . In each fluorescent channel the 31 sample was excited with a laser beam at an angle indicated as follows ( 488nm at 62 . 3° , 561nm at 62 . 5° 32 and 640nm at 65 . 5° ) . All emission light was filtered through a quad channel filter set ( Chroma 89000 ) 33 in the upper filter turret and a secondary bandpass emission filter in the lower turret position was 34 used as follows for each channel ( 488nm excited : filter BP 525 / 50 - Chroma ; 561nm excited : filter BP 35 595 / 50 - Chroma ; 640nm excited : filter BP 700 / 75 - Chroma ) . Light was then passed to a Hamamatsu 36 Orca - Flash 4v3 . 0 sCMOS camera and exposures for channels was set as follows ( 488nm : 100ms , 37 561nm : 100ms , 640nm : 50ms ) with 16bit channel images collected . 38 Acquisition was all controlled through NIS - Elements software ( Nikon ) . Analysis of TIRF images was 39 completed using NIS - Elements General Analysis Module . A general description of the process follows : 40 Cell Area measurements were determined by use of an intensity threshold on the HCS CellMask Deep 41 Red channel at an intensity of 100 AU ( grey levels or arbitrary units ) above the background to mask 42 19 the cell . The Cell area , whole cell Vinculin and Far - Red intensity measurements calculated from this 1 binary region . In addition , an inversion of the cell mask binary was generated to have a means to 2 measure distance to edge of the cell . 3 Vinculin derived Foci were masked using an intensity - based threshold ( Above 10000 AU ) and a size 4 minimum for objects was set to 0 . 5µm 2 to eliminate smaller non foci objects from the binary mask . 5 The foci mask was then limited to the cell mask regions to allow interpretation of the foci in the cell 6 area . Minimum Distance to the outside of the cell for each foci was calculated by measurement of the 7 nearest distance to the inverted non - cell mask . The average distance was then recorded for each 8 image . For each foci intensity measurements were taken for the Vinculin and FarRed channel and the 9 Mean intensity of the foci were recorded . 10 2D VSMC migration time lapse assay 11 24 well plates were incubated with FN ( 5µg / ml ) in PBS overnight at + 4°C and treated with sEVs 12 ( 10µg / ml ) diluted in PBS overnight at + 4°C .

Cells were washed twice 14 with DMEM supplemented with 2 . 5 % exosome - free FBS and incubated in this media for 2hrs + / - 3’ - 15 OMS . Media was replaced for a fresh aliquot and cells were imaged using Opera Phenix High Content 16 Screening System ( PerkinElmer ) every 6min20sec for 8h in a transmitted light channel . 17 Quantification of cellular velocity and directionality was performed in Harmony 4 . 9 ( Perkin Elmer ) . 18 3D VSMC Invasion time lapse assay 19 Acquisition . Migration assay were completed using IBidi Chemotaxis µ - slides ( Ibidi µ - slides # 80326 ) . 20 VSMC were deprived overnight in M199 supplemented with 0 . 5 % BSA , counted and mixed with 21 Matrigel supplemented with / without sEV ( 5ug total in 100µl volume ) to a final cell concentration of 22 ca . 3 x 10 6 cells / ml and stained with Draq5 according to the manufacturer protocol . Slides were left 23 for 30min at 37°C for gelation and chemoattractant - free medium ( 65uL of M199 supplemented with 24 0 . 5 % BSA ) was filled through Filling Port E . Next , the empty reservoir was filled by injecting 25 chemoattractant medium ( 65uL of M199 supplemented with 20 % FBS exosome - free through Filling 26 Port C . 3 slides were loaded and cells were imaged with the Opera Phenix ( Perkin Elmer ) high content 27 imaging platform ( 10x Objective NA 0 . 3 ) . Images were collected for digital phase contrast and a 28 fluorescence channel for Draq5 . Fluorescence was obtained by exciting with a 640nm laser and 29 emission light was filtered with a 700 / 75 bandpass filter to a sCMOS camera . Images were recorded 30 every 10min for 12h in several locations for each slide . 31 Migration tracking and analysis of tracking . Analysis of cell motion was completed on Draq5 images 32 using Harmony Software ( Perkin Elmer ) with measurements of cell area , speed and direction were 33 obtained for each cell / track and timepoint . Cells were not selected for tracking if they were in 34 proximity to other cells of a distance of 35µm . The measurements and object data were exported and 35 further analysis was performed . Data for each track included total length ( timepoints ) , speed ( µm / s ) , 36 Straightness , accumulated distance ( µm ) , lateral displacement ( µm ) and vertical displacement ( µm ) . 37 Data analysis . This data was then analysed using an in - house script using Python library Pandas . Tracks 38 were discarded if they were less than 3 time - points in length . Means and Standard Deviations were 39 calculated for track length ( timepoints ) , Speed ( µm / s ) , Track Straightness and accumulated distance . 40 For each track the Parallel FMI ( forward motion index ) was calculated by taking a ratio of vertical 41 displacement to accumulated distance . The means and standard deviations for these were calculated 42 and reported for each condition similarly . Track Straightness is calculated as the ratio of total 43 20 displacement over total track length . Accumulated distance is the total length of the track from the 1 first to last time point of the track . 2 Clinical samples 3 Patients enrollment .

These extracellular vesicles are entrapped in the extracellular matrix and induce formation of peripheral focal adhesions . Focal adhesions anchor extracellular matrix to the actin fibrils in the cell . Contraction of the actin fibrils generates the mechanical force for cell locomotion and invasion through the matrix .
